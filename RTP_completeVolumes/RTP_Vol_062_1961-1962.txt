W&L To Enter
‘College Bowl’
TV Program

Washington and Lee University
has been invited to compete on the
General Electric College Bowl tele-
vicion program, seen during the
school year Sundays on CBS.

Washington and Lee’s team will
appear on November 12 against the
current defending champion of the
quiz-game program. Among possible
opponents for Washington and Lee
are Pomona College, Washington
University of St. Louis, Hood Col-
lege, and Amherst College.

Should Washington and Lee win,
it would next face University of
North Dakota on the following Sun-
day. A team may win five times be-
fore being retired as an undefeated
champion.

The program originates live from
New York, and Washington and
Lee’s four-member team and coach
will travel to New York on No-
vember 11.

President Fred C. Cole has named
a member of his administrative
staff to set up a selection process
by which Washington and Lee will
pick its team of quickest thinkers
with the most facts. An official
team “coach” will be named later.

Washington and Lee enjoyed con-
siderable success several years ago
in the radio version of the pro-
gram carried on the NBC network.
In 1953, its “varsity scholars” won
six times before losing, and in 1955
a Washington and Lee team won
three matches before meeting de-
feat.

Allen Ludden, who was quiz mas-
ter on the radio show, continues as
the question man on the popular
TV program.

W&L Board Of

The election of Joseph Earle Bir-
nie, Atlanta banker, and Lewis F.
Powell, Jr., Richmond attorney, to
the Board of Trustees of Washing-
ton and Lee University was an-
nounced in July by James R. Caskie
of Lynchburg, rector of the board.

Birnie and Powell will assume
their new duties at the board’s next
regular meeting in October, Caskie
said. Both are alumni of Washington
and Lee, and both have been active
in support of education.

Central Switchboard Installed;
More Efficient Service Promised

A new switchboard system de-
signed to provide improved tele-
phone service for Washington and
Lee University was put into oper-
ation here late in August.

Known in the communications
trade as a P.A.B.X. system, the
switchboard, other control equip-
ment, and connecting lines to some
130 telephones throughout the uni-
versity were installed over the sum-
mer by the Lexington Telephone
Company.

The system enables a central oper-
ator to take all calls to Washington
and Lee and connect calling parties
with up to 100 extension numbers.

From 8 am. to 5 p.m. on weekdays,
all Washington and Lee incoming
calls will be answered by the uni-
versity operator on Lexington num-
ber HO 3-2181. Special provisions for
incoming calls nights, Sundays, and
holidays are being worked out. The
next Lexington telephone directory
will list a limited number of Wash-
ington and Lee numbers which can
be dialed directly after normal
working hours.

The new system enables Wash-
ington and Lee employees to make
interoffice calls by dialing a three-
digit number directly. Calls to the
outside are also dialed directly, by

dialing “9” first and then the Lex-
ington or other number.

James W. Whitehead, assistant to
the president, stressed that the new
system would enable the University
to provide more efficient service,
particularly to outside parties call-
ing Washington and Lee.

He said the operator would assist
in directing calls to proper univer-
sity offices for persons seeking var-
ious kinds of information. In many
cases, the operator will be able to
provide certain information herself,
eliminating the need for further
connections.

Whitehead said the operator may
be helpful in locating persons for
important long distance or other
calls. In effect, the operator will pro-
vide an answering service for all
Washington and Lee numbers.

“Tf a professor knows he will be
away from town, he can inform the
operator and she will be able to pass
on this information to his callers,”
Whitehead explained.

Operators for the switchboard are
Mrs. Josephine Ewers and Mrs.
Edna May Kirkpatrick.

The new system has brought a 36
per cent increase in the number of
telephones at Washington and Lee.
Previously, there were 83 telephones
in use on the campus, compared
with the present 130.

Fraternities Pledge 83 Percent

 

Of Freshman Class

Troubs Meet,
Hold Tryouts
Sunday Night

The Troubadours, Washington and
Lee’s theatre group, get their 1960-61
season underway in a hurry this
week.

There will be an organizational
meeting in the theatre Sunday night
at 7, followed by tryouts for the
first Troub play, Boy Meets Girl,
by Bella and Samuel Spewak.
Those inerested may try out on
Monday and Tuesday night from
7 to 9 in the theatre.

Freshmen interested in acting, or
work on scenery, lighting, business
management, or publicity are invited
to the organizational meeting Sun-
day night.

Dr. Cecil Jones, faculty director,
reminded all voting members to be
on hand Sunday night. Members-at-
large to the Troub executive com-
mittee will be elected then.

Boy Meets Girl offers opportuni-
ties for both novice and experienced
actors. There are 14 male parts to be
cast, including several which can
certainly be played by people with-
out previous experience, according
to Troub publicity director Andy
Leonard.

The play itself is a farce set in
the 1930’s which George Abbott
described as “the best play which
has yet appeared about Hollywood.”
Copies are available at the reserve
desk in the library and may be read
there prior to auditions.

 

Dance Board Sells Record
Number of Dance Plans;
760 Sold For 1961-62

The Dance Board announced to-
day that a record number of Dance
Plans were sold in the registration
lines on Monday and Tuesday. Ap-
proximately 790 plans were sold
for the 1961-62 season.

Steve Galef, Dance Board presi-
dent said that he wished to thank
the students for their excellent re-
sponse to the Dance Board’s new
plans and that he will do every-
thing possible to make this an out-
standing year for the dance sets.
He reported that the entertainment
and procedure at Openings will only
begin to show some of the Dance
Board’s new plans.

Those students who have not yet
purchased Dance Plans and still de-
sire to do so may get them from
members of the Dance Board in the
Co-op next week. The purchase of
a Dance Plan can save a student
more than $35 during the year.

Students who have signed for a
Dance Plan but who have not yet
paid for it may do so by October 6.
They can make out a $25 check
payable to the Washington and Lee
Dance Board and mail it to Box 458,
Lexington, or pay a member of the
Dance Board who will be in the Co-

 

op next week.

Galef estimated that close to 900 |

plans must be sold in order to fully '

260 Men

By KEN LANE

A total of 260 freshmen and 5 transfers pledged to W&L’s
18 fraternities this fall, marking a rise of 18 in the number of
pledges over that of the 1960 Rush Week.

The sharp rise startled IFC officials, who felt that last year’s
decline might have indicated a lack of interest in fraternity

 

VFIC Board
To Visit W&L

Washington and Lee University
will be host Saturday to the Board
of Trustees of the Virginia Founda-
tion for Independent Colleges and
the presidents of the other eleven
member institutions.

Twenty-five leaders of Old Do-
minion business and industry will
join college presidents in a day-long
program aimed at better acquaint-
ing trustees with the various col-
leges their foundation supports.

The Washington and Lee event is
the first such on-campus gathering of
the foundation’s board since the
VFIC was established in 1953. The
trustees hope to visit other campus-
es in subsequent years.

At Washington and Lee, they will
have an opportunity to tour the
campus and buildings and attend
regular class sessions. At luncheon in
Evans Dining Hall, the trustees
and presidents will hear brief talks
by Dean William W. Pusey, III,
of the College, Dean Lewis W.
Adams of the School of Commerce
and Administration, Dean Charles P.
Light, Jr., of the School of Law,
Dean of Students Frank J. Gilliam,
and student body President Andrew
McThenia of Alderson, W. Va.

The visitors will be honored guests
at the 2 p.m. football game between
Washington and Lee and Hampden-
Sydney College, also a member of
the VFIC.

The Virginia Foundation for Inde-
pendent Colleges was established in
1953 to seek financial support for
the state’s privately-supported col-
leges from state business and indus-
try and from other corporations
doing business in Virginia. In its
first year, three contributors gave
$22,000; last year, 573 contributors
gave $680,700 to be divided among
members for operating expenses. In
nine years, 2,322 supporters have
contributed $2,994,628.

A 24-member Board of Trustees
directs the activities of the Foun-
dation, assisted by the presidents of
the participating colleges, and a
small full-time administrative staff.

Stuart T. Saunders, president of
the Norfolk and Western Railway
Co., is chairman of the board of
trustees. President William F. Quil-
lian, Jr., of Randolph-Macon Wo-
man’s College serves as the founda-
tion’s president.

Member _ institutions
Bridgewater College, Emory and
Henry College, Hampden-Sydney
College, Hollins College, Lynchburg
College, Mary Baldwin College,
Randolph-Macon College, Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College, Roanoke
College, Sweet Briar College, the
University of Richmond, and Wash-
ington and Lee University.

include

k membership.

The percentage of the freshman
class that pledged rose from last
year’s 78 per cent to 83 per cent
this year, with a 1961 freshman class
of 315.

Delta Tau Delta led the fraterni-
ties numerically with a pledge class
of 25. PiKA had the second largest
number, 24; Sigma Nu and SPE were
third and fourth, with 22 and 21 re-
spectively.

PiKA and Sigma Phi Epsilon
showed the most noticeable rise over
last year, each gaining eleven more
pledges than last year. Of the eight-
een fraternities, however, only half
have larger pledge classes this year
than last year.

On the other extreme, SAE and
KA underwent the sharpest numeri-
cal drop. SAE, which had the highest
number last year, went from 22 to
’ pledges; KA dropped from 18 to

After last year’s unexpected de-
cline in pledging, this year has been
greatly encouraging. As can be seen
by the statistics below, the outlook
at the beginning of this year was not
bright.

Deferred rush will begin four

weeks after Rush Week. Eligible for
the program are 55 freshmen.

Bob Doenges, president of the In-
terfraternity Council, reported that
the 1961 Rush Week went exception-
ally well, despite the two days period
of rainy weather. Doenges maintain-
ed that “as of yet, no formal com-
plaint has been issued; things ran
pretty smoothly.”

Since the main campus avenue
has been cut off by construction
work, a new parking system was
inaugurated. Fraternities were as-
signed definite parking areas to min-

Moot Court Head Named

John Petzold, senior law student
from Augusta, Maine, has been
named chairman of the W&L Moot
Court Team. Serving as his associ-
ates will be James T. Tate, Jr., law
senior from Richmond, Va., Richard
L. Rose, second year law student
from Allenhurst, N. J., and William
H. Clark, Jr., second year law stu-
dent from Richmond, Va.

The team has begun preparation
for regional competition later this
fall. In the first round arguments,
the squad will face delegations from
law schools in Virginia, South Car-
olina, North Carolina and West Vir-
ginia.

The National Moot Court Compe-
tition is sponsored annually by the
Young Lawyers Committee of the
Association of the Bar of the City

 

 

of New York.

Memo To:

The 1961 Pledge Class

If they follow form, no more than 75 per cent of the Class
of 1965 will pledge a fraternity this weekend. Those who do
take upon themselves the responsibility of defining anew the
role of the fraternity system in the life of Washington and

Lee.

The fraternities must make the goals of the University
their own. If they limit the scope of their activity to social life,
they are giving up their opportunity to help shape the academic
part of school life and to further improve their role in publica-

tions and student government.

We offer these challenges to the fraternities at Washington
and Lee, and particularly to their new pledge classes:

Fraternities must improve their academic standing. A boy
being rushed by a fraternity is never desired as much for his
classroom talents as for his social face, or his athletic abilities.
Each house must make their academic standing a matter of

more than joking concern.

Fraternity expenses must be brought down. Substantial belt-
tightening seems to be in order for most houses. Further, most
board bills at fraternities shot up when freshmen were taken
out of the house dining rooms and put in the Commons. The
Administration, which was relieved of the problem of feeding
most students here for many years by the fraternities, owes
it to them now to help work out some central buying system
for food to help bring down their board expenses.

In publications and student government the fraternities
must prove they are more interested in real ability and real
attainment than they are in the number of offices they can
push their members into. It is more important that we have a
good Calyx, or Ring-tum Phi, or that we are given intelligent
leadership in student government than that a fraternity brother
of ours is a Big Man On Campus.

There has been little evidence of discontent with the fra-
ternity system at Washington and Lee, but if these challenges
are not met here in the next decade the fraternities will have
dug themselves a common grave.

Welcome To The VFIC

The student body joins the administration in welcoming
the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Foundation of Indepen-
dent Colleges to the Washington and Lee campus.

The VFIC raised $680,700 for its members last year.

We who are benefiting now from the foundation’s efforts
are grateful. Future generations of Virginia college students will
probably benefit even more as the VFIC grows.

 

Seven More Professors Get
Glenn Grants For Extra Study

Seven additional Washington and
Lee University professors were
awarded grants-in-aid this summer
totalling $1,169.76 through the
school’s John M. Glenn Program
for faculty research and study.

The new grants bring to 18 the
number of participants under the
1961 Glenn program. Earlier, 11
other professors were given $4,419
in grants whose individual stipends
ranged as high at $900.

The new grants went to:

Dr. Jay D. Cook, Jr., associate
professor of accounting, for partici-
pation in a faculty seminar in ac-
counting at Williams College.

Prof. Paxton Davis, associate pro-
fessor of journalism, for travel in-
volved in preparing a book-length
account of General David Hunter’s
raid on the Valley of Virginia dur-
ing the Civil War.

Dr. Louis W. Hodges, assistant
professor of religion, for study at
Duke University on theological in-
fluences in race relations.

Dr. Cecil D. Jones, Jr., assistant
professor of drama, for study of

 

 

current trends in drama production
in New York City.

Dr. Marion M. Junkin, professor
of fine arts, for summer study at
various art museums in Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.

Dr. Leland W. McCloud, associate
professor of commerce, for partici-
pation in a faculty seminar in sim-
ulation and management games at
Carnegie Institute of Technology.

Dr. Charles F. Phillips, Jr., as-
sistant professor of economics, for
research and writing in theory of
government regulation of business.

Most grants were for summer use,
although they were not restricted
to this period. The John M. Glenn
Program is endowed by a gift of
$120,000 from the estate of the late
philanthropist who was an official
of the Russell Sage Foundation and
an 1879 alumnus of Washington and
Lee.

In addition to the 18 professors
aided through the Glenn program,
four others are sharing in research
funds made available through the
Research Council of the University
Center in Virginia.

Law Student Finds Old bea

A holograph letter written by Dr. | tronomy,’
Dr. Ruffner.

Henry Ruffner, president of Wash-
ington College from 1836 to 1848,
has been found among a collection
of old letters purchased by a Wash-
ington and Lee University law stu-
dent.

Lewis Leigh, Jr., of Chantilly, says
he will give the letter to Washing-
ton and Lee “if they promise not
to bury it somewhere in the arc-
hives.”

Written shortly after Dr. Ruffner
became president of the college, the
letter is addressed to a Colonel As-
pinwall, American consul in London.
It thanks Aspinwall for his assist-
ance in obtaining “A Catalogue of
7,385 Stars” from a London source
for the college’s library.

University librarian Henry Cole-
man says no book by that title is
now in the library, but he believes
a three-volume set, “Vince’s As-

 

is the item referred to by

“If you add up all the stars cata-
logued in the Vince volumes, they
come to approximately 7,385,” Cole-
man explains. “And ‘Vince’s As-
tronomy’ was published in London
in 1814.”

Leigh, a graduate of Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and a freshman
law student at Washington and Lee,
collects old letters and documents.
The Ruffner letter was among a
number purchased recently during
a New England trip.

“I bought it because it had the
Lexington postmark on it,” Leigh
said. “I didn’t know until later that
it was written by a former president
of the school.”

A campus astronomer says that
“Vince’s Astronomy” was quite an
important book in its day.

sion, Dr. William W. Pusey, TI, Dean
of the College, announced today.

were Edwin M. Curley, instructor
in philosophy, and Jay Laurence

President Cole Challenges
Students In Opening Talk

The “privileged few” who are di-
rectly associated with Washington
and Lee must assume a relatively
great individual responsibility, Dr.
Fred C. Cole told the student body
and faculty at the Opening Assembly
last Wednesday.

“We must earn the right that has
been given us through the oppor-
tunity of an association with Wash-
ington and Lee,” Dr. Cole said.

Pointing out the “threat to our
future as free men,” Dr. Cole warned
that we cannot be indifferent.

“Our hope for the future depends
on the kind of men who will make
the decisions that are the products of
minds of intelligence and under-
standing rather than those of ignor-
ance and stupidity.”

Stating that a college education
can help an individual “toward an
understanding of the complex forces
which affect us as individuals and
as nations,” Dr. Cole concluded,
“In a real sense, higher education
is related to our very survival on
this planet.”

“As a university, as a student
body, and as a faculty, we can pro-
vide leadership and service to our
fellowmen and to our nation,” Dr.
Cole said.

“We must earn the right to the
pride we take in being selective
and small in number. Our achieve-
ments must be great far beyond our
size and number.”

 

Haslett Awarded Fulbright
To Study In Germany

David W. Haslett, Washington
and Lee University 1961 graduate
from Hickory, N. C., has been
awarded a Fulbright fellowship for
graduate study in Germany this|
year.

Haslett, 21, a philosophy major,

 

will continue his work in this field
at the University of Freiburg.

Two other Washington and Lee
students, James A. Vann, III, of |
Birmingham, and John A. Broaddus, |
Jr., of Richmond, were announced |
last spring as Fulbright winners for |
study in Auctria and France.

The Fulbright program is admin-
istered by the State Department and |
involves the exchange of students |
with certain foreign countries. Funds |
used to finance the exchanges are)
part of foreign currencies or credits |
owned or owed to the Treasury of
the United States.

Approximately 900 Fulbright fel- |
lowships are granted each year |
among American college students. |

NOTICE

Mr. Whitehead requests that no
students park between the R. E. Lee
Church and the President’s House
on either side of Nelson Street to-
morrow. The Lexington Police De-
partment will rope off the restrict-
ed area, which is being reserved
for the trustees of the Virginia
Foundation of Independent Colleges. |

ment of classical languages to fill a
vacancy created by the July death
of Dr. Earl L. Crum.

The appointment of these men
brings the total of 1961-1962 faculty
additions to 18.

Curley, a B.A. graduate of Lafay-
ette College, is working toward his
Ph.D. in philosophy at Duke Uni-
versity. He is married and has one
child.

Taylor comes to Washington and
Lee from New York University
where he received his A.B. and is
completing work on his doctorate.

The two visiting lecturers in clas-
sical languages are Lexington area
ministers. Dr. Bennetch, pastor of
Fairfield and Alone Mill Lutheran
churches, received his Th.D. from
Dallas Theological Seminary, where
he was later on the faculty. He did
his undergraduate work at Muhlen-
berg College. Dr. Weir, director of
the Methodist Wesley Foundation in
Lexington, received his Ph.D. in
June from the University of Edin-
burgh. He is also a graduate of
Emory University in Atlanta.

Both men will teach part-time in
classics along with a third visiting
lecturer in that department, Peter
D. Fyfe, who was appointed this
summer. Fyfe is a member of the
faculty at Virginia Military Institute.

Comments On Text Book Prices,

Combos, And Assorted Subjects

By STEVE HENRY

“A book is a journey,” said a
placard mounted across a bulletin
board in a grammar school classroom
where we spent most of our early
years.

In case you do not know it al-
ready, a book is also a goldmine,
especially if you happen to own
the textbook concession at a small
liberal arts school in Virginia.

We are not going to name any
names or places, but will offer only
one candid comment: prices are up-
stairs at the downstairs.

There is a certain paradox in the
fact that a small textbook cost more
than a large novel.

We are not going to be so ridicu-
lous as to compare the operators of
the unnamed book shop with the
Jesse James gang.

After all, both Frank and Jesse
used guns in their robberies.

These are the times that try men’s
wallets.

* * *

While on a financial kick, we feel
it necessary to inform the reader
that there is one good buy left in
the modern South.

In a certain Southern town which
we know well, there is a combo that
calls itself “Jo-Jo and the Night-
Crawlers.”

The group plays what we call
questionable _rock-and-roll—ques-
tionable because you are never ex-
actly sure what kind of music Jo-Jo
and his boys are playing.

After a couple of hours, providing
that you have had enough to drink,
you finally decide that Jo-Jo is
playing rock-and-roll.

 

In fact, if you have had enough
to drink, Jo-Jo sounds like Ray
Charles. (One of liquor’s greatest
assets is its ability to make bad
combos sound good, putrid jokes
seem funny, and horrible girls look
lovable.)

This is all off the subject, how-
ever.

As we said earlier, we brought up
Jo-Jo just to make a point, namely
that you can get your money’s
worth on something.

Jo-Jo is the last of the big-time
cheap commodities. For forty dol-
lars, he plays four hours. Pass the
hat and he’ll go two more.

When you consider the fact that
the Night Crawlers know the Hot-
Nut song, then you realize that
Jo-Jo is a super bargain.

Beginning with a $200 budget, you
can get Jo-Jo, plus $160 of liquor,
which is enough to make any party
good.

That’s the point of the whole thing,
anyway.

Perhaps significant, perhaps not,
is the fact that this first week of
school was a week of colossal world-
wide failures.

Maris failed to hit 60, Hurricane
Esther failed to do much damage,
and Dag failed to make it home.

An Oriential philosopher of con-
siderable prominence says:

“School year bred in failure, end
in failure.”

Which is one of the most unorigi-
nal bits of philosophy ever offered
up, and maybe one of the most pro-
phetic for some of us.

 

Gentlemen Crammed, Then Beat
Other Teams In Radio Quiz

By JOHN KIRKLEY

In January of 1954, Washington
and Lee University was selected by
the National Broadcasting Company
to be on the Feb. 18 broadcast of
the “College Quiz Bowl.”

The show was considered one of
the most demanding on raido. How-
ever, the rewards were significant.
The winning team during each pro-
gram received $500 to donate to any
worthwhile campus organization. A
Minnesota team had previously won
$4,000 before being defeated.

Six W&L students were chosen
to compete for positions on the four-
man team. The four selected were
Harold Quinn, Fred lLackmann,
Hank Turner, and Bob Paxton.
These men, and an alternate, Norm
Dobyns, “crammed” for several
weeks before their scheduled match
with Smith College.

Fortunately for our peace of mind,
the W&L team defeated the ladies
from Smith by a score of 180 to
110. The program, recorded in Wash-
ington Hall, contained such ques-
tions as “Who were Mallory and
Irvine and how did they make
headline news in 1924?”

The W&L grappled mentally with
scholars from Chicago on Feb. 25
in their second Quiz Bow! duel. The

 

score this time was a resounding
200 to 150 victory for Washington
and Lee. The prize money had
reached $1,000, and the next oppon-
ent was Princeton.

This time the broadcast was from
a quite crowed Washington Chapel.
Once again the gentlemen showed
their superiority in downing the
boys from Nassau 180 to 140.

In their fouth week the W&L team
defeated Barnard College 190 to
165. Incidentally, it was just before
this show that an awed Barnard girl
exclaimed, “Harold Quinn! We’ve
heard about you!” The fifth and
final victory of the Washington and
Lee brain trust was over iPttsburgh
by a score of 260 to 85.

Finally on March 26 of 1954, the
W&L team was defeated 205 to 130
by Syracuse University. The $2,500
that they had won in prize money
was used, according to their wish,
to set up a memorial scholarship in
honor of John Higgins Williams.

 

NOTICE

For all students in the under-
graduate school interested in trying
out for the College Bowl team a
meeting will be held Monday at
7:30 p.m. in the journalism lecture
room in Payne Hall.

Soccer Practice Gets Underway

With 50 Hopefuls Reporting

Over 50 boys turned out for fall
soccer practice Wednesday, includ-
ing a group of talented freshmen
and a small corps. of experienced
veterans.

Coach Joe Lyles still faces a major
rebuilding job this fall, after losing
several 1960 starters through either
the graduation or fail-out route.

Six starters from last year’s squad
are gone, including standouts Frank
Smith and Steve Hawkins.

Lyles is particularly hurting at the
wing and halfback positions.

“We lost a center-forward, both
wings, a center-half, and our goalie,”
said Lyles. “We’ve got a long way
to go.”

Returnees from last year include
co-captains Harry Preston and Dun-
lop Ecker, Bill Outman, Jim Starkey,

Washington and Lee opens at
Pfeiffer next week, leaving time for
only six more pre-season practice
sessions.

Tigers Offer
W&L Stern

Opening Test

By ED NORTON

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals open the 1961 season at home
tomorrow afternoon against the Tig-
ers of Hampden-Sydney. Kickoff
time will be at 2 o’clock at Wilson
Field.

Coach Lee McLaughlin has rated
the Tigers as potentially the most
dengerous team the Generals will
foce this year. “They will really
went to get us,” he points out,
“ond they will have had ten more
yrectice sessions when we meet.”
Last year the Generals came from
behind in the last quarter to win
14-7, and since both teams have
almost the same personnel the con-
test should repeat as a toss up.

The Generals main strength this
year will be depth and experience,
McLaughlin was able to shuttle three
full teams in and out of last years
games and plans to do the same in
1961; “There’s no doubt about it;
our depth won ball games for us
last year,” he admits.

Returning from last year’s unde-
feated, once-tied team will be 28
lettermen, including 19 seniors, most
of whom will be playing their
fourth season of varsity ball. Also
to the Generals advantage will be
what McLaughlin considers the
finest group of sophomores he has
seen since he came to Washington
and Lee.

Generally, this combination of ex-
perience, depth, and promising young
talent make the Generals chances
to better last year’s 8-0-1 record
extremely bright.

The Generals will operate tomor-
from their double barreled “GO-T”
offense, the combination of “T” and
the single wing attack that pro-
duced 28 touchdowns and nearly
3,000 yards total offense last year.
McLaughlin expects to base his of-
fense around the breakaway threats
of senior fullback Doug Martin and

Bob Pagano, Dave Knight, Lou! Openings Vice Presidents Sunday speedster halfback Jim Hickey.

Frosh Mentor
Praises Spirit,
Laments Size

Speed and spirit, a pair of inval-
uable aids to any football team, are
the strengths of Washington and Lee
University’s freshman grid club.

However, the third

man on the Baby Generals’ roster |
weighs more then 190 pounds, and_/|
these “heavyweights” are in a min-|
ority.

But to new freshman coach Dana
Swan, W&L’s speed and spirit put it
two steps closer to the winner’s
circle.

After only a w2ck’s practice, Swan,
who came to W&L this year from
Swarthmore College, is detecting
signs of a winning ball team. But
mind you, he isn’t predicting his
squad will be a powerhouse.

“Our offense looked good in our
first scrimmage Tuesday,” Swan said.
“We've got three backs with break-
away potential, a couple of bull-
dozing fullbacks and a trio of ade-
quate quarterbacks. Most of these
boys need more experience, how-
ever, before they become good foot-
ball players.”

Swan also praised the offensive
line, but he quickly added:

“Although our linemen’s initial
charges were good, we still have to
teach them to hold their blocks
longer.”

The Baby Generals haven’t begun
their defensive work, but Swan is
optimistic about their abilities to
stop their opponents.

Again citing Tuesday’s scrimmage
Swan said, “Our offense is way
ahead of our defense, but the boys
showed a fair amount of defensive
talent.”

The new coach is leaning toward
a running rather than a passing at-
tack. This is contrary to the usual
W&L offense, but the injury of his
two most experienced ends and the
lack of an outstanding passer have
forced Swan to make the change.

Tigers’ 2-6 Record Last Year Deceiving

(Continued on page 4)
Sophomore Stuart Yoffe, leading
scorer on last year’s freshman team,
should provide additional long range
power. In tomorrow’s closely match-
ed contest, the long gainer could be
the deciding factor. Halfback Jim
Russ and Charlie Gummey and full-
back Tommy Keesee provide added
scoring potential.

Directing the offense will be vet-
eran quarterback Steve Suttle. With
two years of first unit experience
behind him, Suttle does everything
well. He is especially effective when
operating from the “spread offense,”
for he has good running power, and
his passing ability has earned the
respect of opposing defenses. Back-
ing him will be play maker Robin
Wood, and two dangerous passers,
Chuck Lane and John McDaniel.

Up front, the Generals’ line, al-
though neither big or fast, has plen-

ty of experience. Top rated veter-
ans include centers Terry Fohs and
Jerry Hyatt, guards Tommy Good-
win, Barton Dick, and George Cru-
ger, tackles Bill Wheeler and Bob
Payne, and ends Ned Hobbs, Dan
Blaine and Lanny Butler. Center
Mike Sheffey, guard Charlie Savage,
and ends Mike Jenkins and Ed Croft
head an impressive list of sophomore
linemen.

Heading the defensive unit will be
Washington and Lee’s Little All-
American Terry Fohs. The Generals
gave up only 46 points last year,
less than a touchdown a game, and
with the wealth of depth and ex-
perience, the defense should prove
to be even tighter.

Coach Stokeley Fulton’s Tigers
will be empting to rebound from
last year’s 2-6 season and to re-
venge the 14-6 loss to the Generals.

But the Tiger’s record is deceiving,

 

for all eight contests were decided
by 10 points or less. With eight
regulars returning, the first unit
should be solid, but depth will prove
to be a problem for the Tigers. The
major weakness is the quarterback
position where Stewart Shelton is
the only experienced operator.

Hampden-Sydney’s offense calls
for the split-T formation and a
heavy passing attack. Coach Fulton
feels that he has a scoring combi-
nation in quarterback Shelton and
Bobby Saylor. The Tigers have been
working hard to develop the scoring
punch they lacked last season. “Of-
fense is our big concern right now,”
Fulton reports. “We hope to have
an offense that’s capable of scoring
against short-yardage defenses. We
hope we’re not going to give up the
ball inside our opponent’s 10-yard
line like we did last year.”

Other strong points on the Tiger

eleven are guard junior lettermen
Bill Heinzer and Otis Bradley.
Hampden-Sydney also has a stand-
out performer in center Bill Sale,
an All-Virginia small college selec-
tion. In addition to Saylor at end,
senior Tony Rucker, junior Joey
Viar, and sophomore Richard Cralle
make this the Tiger’s strongest po-
sition.
Summary

The Generals’ strength lies in
their depth and experience. In all
positions they are two deep in let-
termen, and in some cases they are
three deep. The only weakness lies
in the lack of overall team size and
speed.

The Tigers first unit has plenty of
experience, but Coach Fulton has no
real depth to depend on. They have
good speed in both the backfield
and line, but they are physically
smaller than last year’s team.

New Freshman Coach Swan
Comes Here From Swarthmore

Washington and Lee University’s
1961 freshman football team is un-
der the direction of a_ full-time
coach for the first time in eight

years.
Athletic Director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly announced today that

Dana W. Swan, II, of Swarthmore,
Pa., has joined the Generals’ coach-
ing staff as a freshman football coach
and instructor in physical educa-
tion.

Swan will coach a frosh squad of
some 30 players through a tough
seven-game schedule against mili-
tary, prep, and junior college op-
position.

A Marine veteran and a 1957
graduate of Swarthmore College,
Swan was varsity backfield coach
and junior varsity coach at Swarth-
more before accepting the W&L
post. He is 29 years old.

“Under our program here, we must
give special attention to the develop-
ment of our freshmen players in
order to sustain the varsity squad
in future years,” varsity head coach
Lee McLaughlin pointed out.

competition at Washington and Lee,
but for the past three years, Coach
McLaughlin has chosen to keep his
freshmen together as a team and let
them play their own schedule.

“We feel the six or seven games
of playing experience will be far
more valuable than the limited serv-
ice they might see with the varsity,”
McLaughlin said. “With a full time
freshman coach, the experience will
be even more valuable.”

Since Washington and Lee adopted
its so-called “amateur” athletic pro-
gram in 1954, freshman and junior
varsity football teams have been
coached by part-time staff members,
usually students in the law school
who played football at Washington
and Lee or other institutions.

Bill King, former University of
Virginia quarterback, will assist
Swan with the 1961 freshmen, along
with Dick White, a regular tackle
for the Generals in 1958 and 1959.
Both are law students.

Last year’s freshman team which
King helped coach turned in a 3-3

ONCE MORE, UNTO THE BREACH

With this installment I begin my eighth year of writing columns
for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, as fine a bunch of men
as you would meet in a month of Sundays—loyal, true, robust,
windswept, forthright, tattooed—in short, precisely the kind
of men you would expect them to be if you were familiar with
the cigarettes they make—and I hope you are—for Marlboro,
like its makers, is loyal, true, robust, windswept, forthright,
tattooed.

There is, however, one important difference between Marl-
boro and its makers. Marlboro has a filter and the makers do
not—except of course for Windswept T. Sigafoos, Vice President
in charge of Media Research. Mr. Sigafoos does have a filter.
I don’t mean that Mr. Sigafoos personally has a filter. What I
mean is that he has a filter in his swimming pool at his home in
Fairbanks, Alaska. You might think that Fairbanks is rather
an odd place for Mr. Sigafoos to live, being such a long distance

   

ate

from the Marlboro home office in New York City. But it should

be pointed out that Mr. Sigafoos is not required to be at work
until 10 A.M.

But I digress. This column, I say, will take up questions of
burning interest to the academic world—like “Should French
conversation classes be conducted in English?” and “Should
students be allowed to attend first hour classes in pajamas and
robes?” and “Can a student of 18 find happiness with an eco-
nomics professor of 90?”

Because many of you are new to college, especially freshmen,
perhaps it would be well in this opening column to start with
campus fundamentals. What, for example, does “Alma Mater”
mean? Well, sir, “Alma Mater” is Latin for “send money”’,

What does “Dean” mean? Well, sir, “Dean” is Latin for
“don’t get caught’’.

What does “dormitory” mean? Well, sir, “dormitory” is
Latin for “bed of pain’.

Next, let us discuss student-teacher relationships. In college
the keynote of the relationship between student and teacher is
informality. When you meet a teacher on campus, you need
not salute. Simply tug your forelock. If you are bald and have
no forelock, a low curtsey will suffice. In no circumstances
should you polish a teacher’s car or sponge and press his suit.
It is, however, permissible to worm his dog.

With the President of the University, of course, your relation-
ship will be a bit more formal. When you encounter the Presi«
dent, fling yourself prone on the sidewalk and sing loudly:

“Prexy is wise
Prexy is true
Prexy has eyes
Of Lake Louise blue.”

As you can see, the President of the University is called
“Prexy”. Similarly, Deans are called “Dixie”. Professors are
called “Proxie”’. Housemothers are called “Hoxie Moxie”.
Students are called ““Amoebae’’.

Is Glasgow

Lecturer

A 33-year-old Broadway
playwright will come to Wash-
ington and Lee University
next Spring as Glasgow Visit-
ing Professor.

The appointment of Edward

Albee, who has written several
Broadway productions, was an-
nounced today by Dr. Arthur Ross
Borden, chairman of the Glasgow
Endowment Committee and profes-
sor of English.

The playwright’s stay here will
coincide with production of two of
Albee’s plays—The Zoo Story and
The American Dream—by the Wash-
ington and Lee Troubadours. He
will attend rehearsals of these plays
and advise in their production.

Albee will also conduct class-
room discussions on his plays and
contemporary drama and will de-
liver a public lecture during his
visit in May.

The Glasgow Visiting Professor
Program was established in 1957 “to
promote the art of expression by
pen and tongue.” The first Glasgow
professor was novelist Katherine

Anne Porter, who was in residence
in 1958-59.

Glasgow-sponsored literary vis-
itors last year included poet John
Ciardi, contemporary novelist Wil-
liam Humphrey and_television-
screen writer Merle Miller.

Albee wrote his first play when
he was 12. His first professional
play—The Zoo Story—was produced
in Berlin in 1959. Its first American
production was at Provincetown
Playhouse in New York. In 1959, he
wrote two plays: The Death of Bessie
Smith, also premiered in Berlin; and
The Sandbox, commissioned for the
Festival of Two Worlds at Spoleto,
Italy.

 

Students Urged To Tryout

Students interested in trying for

will recommend to President Cole
that the University withdraw its ac-
ceptance of the invitation to appear
on the CBS network television pro-
gram.

Parsons says he has appealed to
the faculty to recommend students

Varied Scholastic Aids Offered

Woodrow Wilson

Dean William W. Pusey today
urged all interested seniors to con-
tact him as soon as possible about
possible nomination for Woodrow
Wilson Fellowships for 1961-63.

All seniors who are interested in
a career in college teaching should
discuss the fellowships at their
earliest convenience with their ma-
jor professors and with Dean Pusey,
who is campus representative for
the Fellowships. The deadline for
nominations is October 31.

The Foundation primarily selects
candidates in the humanities and
social sciences, but in exceptional
cases, when clear preference for
teaching is demonstrated, candi-
dates from the natural sciences are
also considered, he added.

A fellow receives $1,500 for the
year’s study, plus dependency al-
lowance; the Foundation also pays
tuition and fees.

Four Washington and Lee seniors
received Wilson Fellowships last

June.
Ww w
Marshall and Fulbright

Applications for the Marshall and
Fulbright scholarships are now be-
ing received by Dr. Charles W.
Turner of the Washington and Lee
history department.

Dr. Turner has announced that
students interested in applying for
either of the scholarships should
contact him as soon as possible. Ap-
plications for the Fulbright grants
must be submitted by November 1,
those for the Marshall program by
October 31.

Marshall receive

scholars’ will

 

$1,540 a year plus tuition for two
years study at the university of their
choice in the United Kingdom. In
some instances the scholarship may
be extended for a third year of
study.

Those who are awarded a Ful-
bright grant generally continue their
studies in Germany, France or Eng-
land. “The university has had win-
ners each year since the inception
of this program,” Dr. Turner said.
Last year four students from the
college received grants.

In addition to the Fulbright grants,
the Institute of International Educa-
tion sponsors several scholarship
programs. For further information
students should see Dr. Turner.

Ww Ww
Rhodes

The last day for students to ap-
ply for a 1961 Rhodes Scholarship
will be Friday, September 28, Dr.
Fitzgerald Flournoy, chairman of
the faculty sub-committee on schol-
arship, said today. .

Under the scholarship, a student
is granted over $2000 a year to study
at Oxford University.

The scholarship is awarded to
those students in the junior class
or above who demonstrate best all-
around record of scholarship, char-
acter, leadership, and sportsmanship
(in athletics not necessarily on a
collegiate scale.) In addition the
student must show “promise of dis-
tinction” in some one field.

A candidate may apply in the
state where he resides or attends
college.

“The first step in applying for
the scholarship,” Dr. Flournoy men-

 

tions, “is to get the approval of
the faculty.”

At W&L the entire faculty votes
on candidates whose names and
records are submitted to the com-
mittee. This will take place at the
next faculty meeting on Oct. 2.

Dr. Flournoy, a recipient of the
scholarship in 1922, recalls that at
least three W&L students have been
Rhodes Scholars in the last ten
years. The most recent was Jon
B. McLin (’59), who is currently
studying at Oxford under this plan.

There are 32 scholarships given
each year in the U‘S., four to each of
eight districts. Included in the Vir-
ginia district are North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and
Tennessee.

Glee Club Selects
24 New Men

The 1961-62 Washington and Lee
Glee Club’s season, under direction
of Professor Robert Stewart, got un-
derway Monday evening with the
first regularly scheduled rehearsal
of the year.

Plans for the season include a
concert for Parents’ Weekend, re-
turn engagements at several of the
girls’ schools visited in the past, and
a possible Christmas program. Of-
ficers are also working on plans for
another Spring Concert Tour next
April, similar to last year’s trip to
Wilmington and Richmond.

At auditions held Thursday and
Friday of last week, twenty-four
men from the freshman class were
selected to work with the nearly
60-man club. They are: Gordon Ar-

New PE Rules

A new policy on absences from
P.E. classes has been announced by
Dean William Pusey.

(1) A general medical excuse
from all classes will be required
in order for a student to be ex-
cused from a class in Physical
Education on any particular day.

(2) Four unexcused absences are
available to students for minor
medical complaints (headaches,
colds) and other purposes. For
students with a grade point ratio
of 2.00 or better, eight unexcused
absences.

(3) Students who do not comply
with the above regulations will be
dropped with a grade of F.

(4) Elimination of the statement
in the catalogue, page 92, that “no
student is considered for honors
or for Dean’s List privileges who
is marked Incomplete in Physical
Education.”

(4) That the above go into ef-
fect on a trial basis in September
1961.

Challenges To The Fraternities:
They Must Be Dealt With Soon

The fact that 83 per cent of this year’s freshman class
pledged fraternities appears to us as being a living witness
that the fraternity system at Washington and Lee has become
stronger, and that the system does have its merits. Paramount
among these merits, we would place companionship, friendship,
and the opportunity to associate freely with one’s classmates.

We cannot, however, overlook the fact that the fraternities
should adopt some definite aims and goals which they must
attempt to reach, and that each of the houses must begin
to make their moves immediately.

Nearly everyone will agree that the academic side of
fraternity life has been slighted in past years, and that
the social whirl seems to have played the major role in
the fraternities. It is our feeling that if the system is to
prove itself worthy of being allowed to continue, then
fraternity men must begin to place more stress on the
academic work of their members. Is it not fairly obvious
that the fraternities’ cumulative grade point ratio once
again fell below the non-fraternity men’s average last
semester, and that if revision doesn’t come soon that
this surely will happen again?

The fraternity system is under constant fire nationally, and
we assert that the main reason for this is because fraternity
leaders have not exercised enough restraint in their houses,
and that many members have almost completely forgotten why
they came to college in the first place.

As far as W&L is concerned, we believe that the fra-
ternities must (1)improve their academic standing and
(2) watch their spending. Washington and Lee stu-
dents must realize that not everyone is a millionaire,
and that for many, belonging to a fraternity is an over-
whelming expense.

These two challenges must be met by the fraternities, and
they must be dealt with in the very near future. If these prob-
lems are not answered, then future students of W&L may
not have the opportunity to become fraternity men. To both
the fraternity leaders and fraternity members we offer these
challenges. The next step lies in your hands.

Hooray For The Dance Board!

It is encouraging to us that a record number of Dance
Plans have been sold, and that sales have been going well this
year. A record 801 Plans were sold by yesterday, and the
number appears to be on the rise.

Dance Board President Steve Galef’s estimation that ap-
proximately 900 Dance Plans must be sold to meet expenses
we feel merits the consideration of those who have not yet
purchased their Plans.

We believe that the Dance Board, under Galef’s
direction, has made some very definite improvements.
Among these improvements are (1) that the bands
contracted seem to be more in line with student inter-
ests, and (2) that the Board appears to have lost its
once overbearing “let’s make a pile of money” ap-
pearance. These two achievements we praise and are

thankful for.

It is not, however, only important that students simply
buy the Dance Plans, they must further lend support to the
Board by attending the dances. If the attendance at the dances
is increased this will prove to the Board that their efforts are
both appreciated and appropriate. With this assurance they
will know their work has not been in vain.

‘EMPHASIS’ TO BEGIN IN TWO WEEKS

Emphasis, a new series of articles
which will deal with various phases
of W&L life, will appear in this
year’s Tuesday Edition. The first
series will begin in two weeks and

will be written by Associate Editor
Bill Bowen. The series considers
“The Academic Toughness of W&L.”
It is our hope that both faculty and
students will enjoy Emphasis.

 

 

FLAVORS FROM ONION TO SHRIMP

 

Chips And Dip -- Rush Gimmick

By GEORGE HONTS
Tuesday Columnist

Thank God rush week is over.
Maybe I’m just getting old, but
each one of them seems to be less
inviting. I’ve seen four rush weeks,
including one as a rushee, and this
last one was the worse one of
all.... Mostly because a majority
of the freshmen seemed to have

brains and seemed to be using
them.

Rushing was a lot easier four
years ago I’m sure. The fresh-
men then didn’t think. Not only
that, each house had its very own
speciality then. I remember one
house was selling regionalism. All
the fraters at another house should
have worn their coats inside out.

 

Varied Beliefs
Dismember Us

This I believe...

In this era, unrivaled by any other in terms of destructive
potentiality, I think that I am not alone in comparing myself
to a dismembered figure that has been rent asunder by beliefs

as variable as the weather.

The diversity in conviction is *
exemplified by the individual who
builds a bombshelter from which
he releases a covey of doves to
search the distant corners of the
world for an olive branch taken
from the tree of perpetual peace.

To whom do we turn in these
trying times for answers to the all-
important questions concerning our
future. I find myself completely
befuddled by the wide variety of
opinions offered “by people who
know.” For every authority that
advocates limited warfare there is
another who swears that our only
hope is to survive the nuclear at-
tack which is “just around the
corner.”

I do not know whether to issue
forth with a puzzled laugh or a fear-
ful cry when the first article I read
relates with “high” optimism the
possibilities behind a nuclear test
ban while, on the second page, an-
other review states that the only
thing “high” is the amount of radio-
activity in the air.

Perhaps there are no exact an-
swers to the seemingly paradoxical
situations and beliefs which plague
the world of today. I, for one, find
my opinions based on faith rather
than fact and, therefore, refrain
from offering any semblance of a
solution in regard to this sea of
judgments.

It is best not to evaluate or
scrutinize each particular belief
but rather to attempt an under-
standing of the environments and
events which produce the multi-
farious trends of thought. The
eminent historian, Arnold J.
Toynbee, portrays a striking al-
legory concerning the milieu of
the modern world when he writes
of the “six young Scandinavian
seafarers” who set sail across the
Pacific Ocean on the raft Kon-
Tiki:

“Beyond the line of surf breaking
over this barrier the approaching
seafarers could descry the feathery
tops of palm-trees, and they knew
these palms bedecked idyllic isles
set in a still lagoon; but between
them and this haven ran the foam-
ing and thundering reef, and the
set of the current and the wind gave
the voyagers no chance of circum-
navigation. They were heading per-
force towards an inevitable ordeal;
and, though they might know what
were the alternatives awaiting any
voyagers in this plight, they could
not guess which of these alternatives
was to be the ending of their own
saga.”

By Dave Knight, Columnist

 

All they had to sell was a Brooks
Brothers label. A third house
didn’t even have that. ...all they
offered was Country Club by the
six pack. Their pledge pins resem-
ble a beer barrel, but oddly none
of the members there drank, as
well as I can remember.

Another house kept a bleached-
blonde around. She did all the
rushing, but I never did know who
she was supposed to belong to.
I didn’t get a bid so I can’t com-
ment on their mystic rites either.
Then there was a house that did
nothing but sing. I still wonder
whether they were a bunch of
Sinatras or Liberaces. And an-
other house had a closet case. Not
boys, athletic trophies. I bet they
had a hundred of them in reserve.

The picture is all muddled now.
The blonde is still around but
she’s not selling fraternities any
more. The house with the trophies
must have had a sale, everybody’s
got one this year. Country Club

has gone out of style and no one
has been to Brooks Brothers since
last Thanksgiving. And everybody
was singing this rush week. It
sounded like a Holy Roller Re-
vival Wednesday night.

Apparently the big sell this year
was on potato chip dip. Every
house has its own special recipe—
they range from blue cheese to
onion to shrimp and back again.

Before any freshman was bid at
any house, he had to first give a
satisfactory answer to “How do
you like our potato chip dip.”
If the kid didn’t like it he was
an immediate cool-job and was
pushed toward whatever house
was the big rival at the moment.
I guess the fraters figure the other
house would be getting what it
deserved.

Fraternities have, or should
have, a very definite place in the
social and academic life of every
college man. If a freshman really
likes beer and dip, then sell him
on beer and dip. Personally, after
nursing the battle scars of four
rush weeks, it seems to me to be
an insult to the intelligence of
youth to give freshmen the rush
job they get. Most of them must
get awfully tired of all that dip.

* *

LAST YEAR there was much
talk on the honor system being
over-loaded. The trouble centered
around the Dance Board edict
making dance plan transfers dis-
honorable. The Board finally had
to back down on its decision and
now it is doing the job it is sup-
posed to do—get some entertain-
ing entertainment for the dance
weekends. The honor system,
though, is still expanding, but
in different directions. Doc has
now installed a change-for-the-
new-cigarette machine honor sys-
tem of his own. Isn’t it amazing
what the machine has done to

 

make gentlemen of us.

With Smile, Quick Joke, Helping Hand
Bob Murray Wins Students’ Respect

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Managing Editor

It is often said that Big Brother
watches over us.

Washington and Lee has a big
brother, and he does watch over
the students. But he doesn’t track
the students like a hawk relentless-
ly hunting an unsuspecting prey.
Instead he acts as a friend.

W&L’s big brother is C. F.
“Bob” Murray, the university
proctor.

When the university hired Murray
a lieutenant on the Lexington po-
lice force in 1958, it said his duties
would be “to help the students not
police them.”

Some students, however, took a
different attitude.

“We don’t want a cop. Why do
do we need a cop?” were some of
the comments.

But Murray came to the campus
with his big smile and a quick joke
and soon won the students’ friend-
ship and respect. Soon students
began to return that friendly smile
and many greet him as “Bob.”

In fact after only two weeks as
proctor, the Ring-tum Phi praised
Murray. It stated editorially that

respect and loyal friendship of a, versity rules when necessary. His

large number of the students. We
wish him every success.”

Murray’s job covers everything
from student parking to student
conduct; and he enforces the uni-

Volume Two, Number One

It seems very natural to start out the second year of
these columns with a weleome back to all the flunkies who
got reinstated, and a traditional hello to the freshmen. May-
be I should just print a great big HI in italics, and then I
won’t have to speak to anyone except tourists and the people
who don’t read the Ring-tum Phi.

These non-readers are the subject of much discussion in
the pine-panelled editorial office of the Tuesday Edition
and after calling a Madison Avenue market analysis firm,
we've decided to start a circulation war with Friday. That
is, the war will be with the Friday Edition, for Friday itself
is circulated enough as it is.

In a preliminary study we (Roy Goodwin and my-
self) found that in several instances the Tuesday Edi-
tion is already way out in front.

For instance, there are more issues of our paper in the
seats of the Lyric than any other journal—except the Rock-

  

See EE Eee

RES IPSA LOQUITUR

 

bridge Gazette. Also there are more Tuesday Editions found
in fraternity garbage cans on Wednesday morning than any
other times—except Saturday when the Friday paper takes
a slight lead.

We plan to remedy this by withholding half of our circu-
lation list until late Friday night. Without boasting I be-
lieve that I may say that within a week or two the local
garbage collectors can count on the Tuesday Edition leading
the field every morning.

Of course any circulation war needs some bright
new features. In this line we have decided to offer
our readers a monthly bonus which the Friday Edition
cannot hope to compete with. This bonus will be on a
limited edition basis only, and will be sold at Mc-
Crum’s exclusively. It will be called Playboy.

Another area in which Roy and I noticed room for im-
provement was the wrapping department. Hence the Tuesday
Edition will print every hundredth copy on an old brown
bag from the ABC store. This will help to promote the utili-
tarian aspects of our paper.

Before becoming W&L’s proctor,
Murray was a Lexington policeman
for 12 years. He was in the Marine
Corps for four years during World
War II.

Despite his police background,
Murray is regarded as the student’s

who only enforces rules. He’s just a
big brother who is always willing

occasions when crucial yardage was
needed. Coach McLaughlin praised
Suttle for his field leadership and
ballhandling as well as his fine
blocking.

Coach Mac also pointed to the
play in which Suttle picked up a
loose ball and completed an eight
yard pass, as typical of Suttle’s
quick thinking.

Hampden-Sydney came awfully
close to marring Washington and
Lee’s 1961 football record in the
opening game Saturday.

Just how close the Tigers came
to grabbing a 6-6 tie, few of the
3,000 fans at Wilson Field realized.

Halfback Jim Russ, one of
W&L’s many heroes, dived over
from the two with 4:12 left in
the third period to tie the score.
Then he dropped back to try the
winning extra point. His boot
sailed perfectly through the up-
rights, but there’s an unusual
story behind this all important
kick.

 

“I wasn’t ready to kick,” Russ
said after the game. “I was practic-
ing my timing when I suddenly
hear ‘hike, hike’.”

Lady Luck seemed to have spread
an invisible cloak of luck across
Wilson Field in the fateful third
period.

The Generals marched 64 yards in
short, stubby chunks for the 7-6
vietory and needed all the luck they
could muster.

Twice it appeared that the
Hampden-Sydney defense had
choked W&L’s slow-motion ground
attack, but quarterback Steve
Suttle kept the Generals alive
with a pair of short passes.

With fourth down and six yards to

go at the Hampden-Sydney 26, Sut-
tle fired an aerial strike to fullback
Tommy Keesee at the 19. Then with
fourth and six to go at the H-S 15,
Suttle again took to the air lanes.
But it took a leaping catch by Russ
at the eight to get the first down.

Three plays later, Russ made
W&L’s third straight clutch fourth
down play as he dived for the touch-
down from the two.

The Generals came up with the
do-or-die play three times in their
drive, but they lacked the big play
that propelled them to their 8-0-1
record last year.

The first half was a story of
flustration for W&L while the sec-
ond half was an unsuspected de-
light of staunch defense by the
gold or third team.

Only once did the Generals move
beyond the H-S 45-yard line in
the first half. That drive carried to
the 34 where fullback Doug Martin
fumbled.

H-S end Tony Rucker recovered
the fumble and started the Tigers
on their only scoring march.

One play later halfback Lewis
Everette, blasting off like a rocket,
set his sights on the W&L end zone.
But Wayne Bradshaw pulled him
down from behind after a 36-yard
gallop at the W&L 31.

 

Generals Edge By H-S Tigers 7-6

The Tigers scored nine plays later
on a seven-yard pass from quarter-
back Stuart Shelton to end Bobby
Saylor.

But guard Bob Payne crashed
through the H-S defenders and
blocked Fred Mitchell's try for
the extra point.

Hampden-Sydney, which rolled
up 105 yards in total offense the
first half, returned to the field
after intermission confident of a
victory.

But they hadn’t tried to run
against W&L’s Chinese Bandits
(Gold team) before.

The Bandits, a mixture of soph-
omores, juniors, and seniors, stop-
ped the Tigers cold. In fact,
Hampden-Sydney ended up with
a minus ten yards total offense
for the second half.

The Tigers’ passing attack, which
had been effective in the clutch in
the first half, couldn’t even get into
the air against the Bandits.

Not once, but three times the
Bandits threw H-S’s quarterbacks
Shelton and Mitchell for long losses
when they tried to pass.

Terry Fohs, the Generals’ line-
backer, was credited with 11 tackles
in the game, although he played just
half the game on defense. Terry
didn’t see much second-half action.

Community Work Keynotes UCA

By KEN LANE

President of the University Chris- |
tian Association, Pete Agelesto, an- |
nounced that this year the organiza- |
tion is initiating a new approach in
its program.

The UCA has altered its policy in|
order to present a more stimulating |
challenge to students. “The empha- |
sis,’ Agelasto states, “is now on}
work of a more constructive and |
worthwhile nature. In the past few |
years, the organization has given |
the impression of inertia and stag-|
nancy. The changes inaugurated this
year should arouse a more spirited
interest.”

Community service will be the

keynote of UCA activity. Projects |
will include home construction, food |
distribution, and a Big Brother pro- |
gram in which members work with |

troubled boys. Class instruction and |

other assistance will be given to

| neighboring mountain churches. The
Boy’s Club, in which area youngsters
| are coached in athletics, is of major
| interest.

Of popular interest are the dis-

| cussion panels and seminars to be

conducted in the course of the year.
Dealing with current controversial
topics, these serve as a nucleus for
stimulating discussion.

On the purpose of the UCA, Age-
lasto remarked that “it functions for
better understanding on questions

Frank Young

Dance Board

Selects Young

By Robert Thomas

Frank Young, Phi Delt
junior from Birmingham, Ala-
bama, has been named Vice-

président of the Dance Board

for the 1961-62 school year.

Board President Steve Galef, in
announcing the appointment Thurs-
day, stated: “We were favorably
impressed during the interview and
have every confidence in Frank’s
exécuting’ the duties of the office.
He mentioned several new ideas that
met with our approval.”

Yourig’s primary function will be
to assist the Dance Board President
and to learn the functions of that
office, since he will become Presi-

day night.

 

dent next year. He will also man-
age the’ sale of costumes for the
Fancy Dress Ball this winter.

The innovations Young will acti-
vate is the formation of a Dance
Board Advisory Council open to all
W&L students. The council will
serve to acquaint members with the
activities of the Dance Board itself,
thereby aiding the Board in its en-
deavors and providing experienced
members for next year.

This council has been in the plan-
hing stage and will soon be formed.

In the spring; a survey of the en-

tire student body will be conducted
to determine the tastes and prefer-
ences’ of entertainment for next
year’s dance sets. Young hopes to
provide performers that conform to
the’ prevailing interests of the cam-
pus.
Another tentative innovation will
be the holding of the dance sets in
the Freshman Commons, thereby
providing a more appropriate and
commodious atmosphere for the ac-
tivity.

Galef also commented: “Young will
receive much responsibility as pos-
sible in: the performance of his
duties. We feel he is well qualified
and are expecting a high degree of
leadership.”

Young’s activities include: frater-
nity treasurer, Cold Check Com-
mitteeman and SWMSFC. He is also
a member of the Glee Club, House
Managers’ Association, and the White
Friars. He is a Dean’s List student,
and has a 1.8 overall average. Young
is majoring in History and intends
to study law.

Galef further mentioned that all
has been arranged for Openings
Dance Set, October 13 and 14. Dance
Plan Sales have reached 825, with
the goal set at 900. Complete support
of the plans will enable the presen-
tation of an outstanding array of tal-
ent at all four dance sets.

Debate Society

A demonstration debate by the
Washington and Lee debate society
is scheduled at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday,
Oct. 3, in Payne Hall 31.

Introducing the topic, “Resolved
that labor unions will be subject
to the jurisdiction of anti-trust leg-
islation,” will be veteran General
debaters Bill: McEnally, Al Eckes,

sophomores.

EC Discusses
Conduct Group

At its meeting Tuesday

| night the Executive Committee

heard a report from president
Andrew McThenia on the stu-
dent government conference

at Randolph-Macon College
last weekend, and reports from Joe
Goldstein, chairman of the Library
Committee, and Steve Rutledge, As-
similation Committee chairman.

The EC also approved Steve
Galef’s nominations of Bill Noell,
Stan Atwood, and Steve Henry to
the three non-fraternity posts on
the Dance Floor Committee.

A motion by president McThenia
to change the wording in Honor
System procedures from “accused
of a violation of the Honor System”
to “accused of a breach of honor”
was defeated by a 7-3 vote.

The EC gave its backing to a
program that Goldstein outlined to
more rigidly enforce the library
rules, particularly the rules against
unauthorized removal and hiding of
books.

Goldstein and Rutledge were each
asked to send in monthly reports on
the activities of their respective
committees.

Student Disciplinary Group?

President McThenia reported that
representatives of the other schools
at the student government confer-
ence preferred to have student mis-
conduct cases handled by a student
group rather than a faculty com-
mittee.

McThenia sad he would like to
appoint a committee to study the
possibility of having some student
group other than the EC handle
cases of student misconduct here.
The faculty has a committee which
handles all such cases now.

Committeemen Meade Christian
and Tim Ireland volunteered to serve
on the study committee.

McThenia said many representa-
tives at the conference said they
would like to become better ac-
quainted with the system of student
government at W&L.

All members of the EC were pres-
ent at the Tuesday meeting.

The EC meets on Tuesday again
for its regular weekly meeting, at
7 p.m. in the Student Union.

GOP To Meet
Tuesday Night

The first Young Republican meet-
ing of the 1961-1962 school year will
be held next Tuesday night October
3, at 7 p.m. in the Student Union.

Craig Distlehorst, Region III
Chairman of Organization for the
Young Republicans and Charles
Wright, the Virginia Vice Chairman,
will discuss Young Republican or-
ganization from the college club to
the national level. A report will be
given on the National Y. R. Con-
vention held this past summer.

Hank Oder, Rockbridge County
Republican Chairman will discuss
the present gubernatorial race in
Virginia and how the W&L Y. R.
Club can participate in it.

After the gubernatorial election in
November, the club, in cooperation
with the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, will present a series of dis-
cussions of practical politics. Guest
speakers will be invited to guide
these discussions.

For the first time, the club hopes
to be able to start a newspaper to
provide a sounding board for stu-
dent opinion on events of national
and international significance. It is
also hoped that political events on
campus may be given fuller discus-
sion and coverage through this
means.

All student Republicans are urged
to attend this first organizational
meeting, even if they feel they will
not have the time to actively par-
ticipate in club activities. An in-
active membership list will be drawn
up so that these boys will receive
Republican announcements.

The officers for the 1961-62 Young
Republican’s Club will be elected
at this meeting. Freshmen are elig-
ible for office.

 

 

NOTICE

Plans are underway for Parents’

Conservative

Society Plans
Kickoff Meeting

The newly formed Conservative
Society of Washington and Lee will
hold its opening meeting on Wednes-
day, October 4 at 7 p.m. in duPont
auditorium. Society president Brent
Arthur announced last night that
the Film Communist Encirclement—
1961 would be shown then.

The purpose of the meeting will
be to explain the purpose and func-
tions of the Society to any interested
newcomers, to welcome those who
are interested in active participa-
tion in the Society’s program, and to
organize that program for the com-
ing semester.

On October 17, the Society will
present William S. P. Cotter of
Yale, who is the Organizational Di-
rector of the Young Americans for
Freedom. At this time, the film
Operation Abolition will be shown.

Society vice president, Andy Mc-
Thenia, said he expected a good
turn-out for the opening meeting.
He emphasized the fact that the
meeting would be open not only to
the W&L student body, but also to
any townspeople or other outsiders
who might be interested in the
“conservative” philosophy of gov-
ernment.

Conservative Aims

The Conservative Society will of-
fer “a medium through which in-
terested students can express their
views on conservative government.”
The objects of the Society as stated
in its constitution are as follows:

To provide the organizational
framework to implement the general
objectives of the Conservative So-
ciety as announced in its doctrine of
beliefs taken from the Sharon State-
ment as composed by the Young
Americans for Freedom on Septem-
ber 11, 1961.

The publication of a journal con-
cerned with national and _ inter-
national affairs.

The establishment of a speaker’s
forum to bring prominent conser-
vative scholars, politicians, and jour-
nalists to the campus of Washington
and Lee.

The presentation of a course to
interest members in practical politics.
This course, which is non-partisan
in nature was developed by the
United States Chamber of Commerce
to be given to any group interested
in acquainting themselves with the

NOTICE

The Assimilation Committee wish-
es to emphasize that the following
conventions are to be observed at
all times and all places within the
city limits of Lexington:

(1) Conventional dress.

(2) Speaking first.

And for the especial benefit of the
Freshman Class, the following:

(1) Wearing beanies at all times
including Saturday afternoon, foot-
ball games, and Sundays.

(2) Taking the initiative to speak
first.

(3) Refraining from walking on
the grass.

Finally, the wearing of tennis
shoes on campus and the failure to
wear sox are both considered non-
conventional. Any further uncer-
tainties can be solved by reading
the Student Handbook.

Eggheads Match Wits
In Quiz Bowl Tryout

By Randall Jones

Guffaws of amazement and pregnant “ahs!” filled the
air last night as Presidential assistant Frank Parsons admin-
istered the first of a series of elimination quizzes to pick the four

on the GE College Bowl quiz

Seventy-nine men tried the test.
The advance betting on Washington and Lee’s chances in

*the College Bowl must have turned
sharply in W&L’s favor.

After drawing only a dozen or so
applicants for the team at a Monday
night meeting, Mr. Parsons, who is
supervising the team selection for
the administration, instituted a crash
publicity program in which he sent
out personal letters to some 20 stu-
dents recommended by the faculty,
and had professors making short pep
talks in classes yesterday.

The result was the 79 men who
tried the first of a series of prelimi-
nary quizzes last night.

The meeting had been scheduled
for the journalism lecture room, but
when the journalism room was filled
and people were still trying to get in
the door, it was moved from there
over to Newcomb 8, which was very
nearly filled up.

There Mr. Parsons administered a
written quiz of fifty questions. You
had 20 seconds to get the answers.

Sample question: “Take the
number of famed islands in the
St. Lawrence River and add this
number to the number of degrees
in an equalateral triangle. For
your answer, give the number
which must be added to this sum
to get the date of the Battle of
Hastings.”

Mr. Parsons says he plans to give
one or two more written quizzes
like the one last night before he
attempts to cut down the number
trying out. “We really need to give
100 or 150 questions before we can
tell anything,” he said.

He said that if more students want
to try out for the quiz team, he will

give the first quiz again, but would
not be able to do it on an individ-
ual basis.

After the written quizzes have
provided the basis for a first cut, Mr.
Parsons said he would go on to
oral elimination quizzes similar to
the College Bowl itself.

The GE College Bowl is seen in
this area at 5:30 p.m. Sundays on
Channel 7, Roanoke.

On To New York

Last night’s large turnout for the first trial quiz for the
College Bowl quiz team must have been gratifying to everyone
who would like to see Washington and Lee “‘win again another
time” in this peculiar intellectual sport.

 

From the large number of men who tried the quiz last
night, we ought to be able to field a team which can hold its
own against Pomona, or Amherst, or whoever they send up
against us.

The trial quiz was tough but stimulating, and certainly a
lot of fun. We ourselves retired to the Liquid afterwards last
night to pose a few more experimental questions at one another.

Maybe W&L will once again prove that the pursuit of
knowledge and having a good time DO mix.

Anyway, we’re pretty gung-ho about the forthcoming
battle of wits.

More Sound And Fury

John Paul’s proposed revision of the student body consti-
tution which is released today contains a number of suggestions
which are worthy of consideration.

We feel that the nominating convention could well be done
away with.

The overall emphasis of the document is primarily on
ways and means by which the quality of student leadership
may be improved. We question some of the means and will dis-
cuss them at greater length later.

We feel that the student body leadership has been excellent
on the whole and that this year’s crop of campus leaders is one
of the best ever.

Certainly no Executive Committee in recent years has dem-
onstrated its academic ability so well, nor performed so much
individual service for the student body.

What is lacking is emphasis on the most important problem
which faces the Executive Committee—its responsiveness to
the student body and the means by which it may exert stronger
leadership here.

These needs will not be met by constitutional amendments
but rather by more imaginative use of the influence of the
executive committee.

The EC’s decision last week to encourage more thorough
press coverage of its meetings was a step in the right direction.

A similar forceful use of its present power will do more
for the student body than some more of last spring’s sound and
fury about the constitution.

Next, The Liberals

The Young Republicans and the Conservative Society
seem to be off to a running start this year. Now we’re waiting
to see if the Young Liberals will rally to the support of their
boy in the White House.

We're all in favor of this political activity. It certainly
speaks well for the concern of the present college generation
with the political role they must play in the next few decades.

We'd like to see some opposition to the present conserva-
tive domination of the campus. We have our own opinions but
it would be well for an opposition party to spring up to keep us
right-wingers on our toes.

The Library Problem

This week’s Executive Committee meeting was largely de-
voted to a discussion with Joe Goldstein, chairman of the li-
brary committee, about possible means of gaining a wider
adherence to the rules of the library.

Joe said that unauthorized removal and hiding, particularly
of reserve books, were common offenses.

The library committee has had a great deal of difficulty
enforcing these rules. We understand that the Student Bar
Association has had the same trouble in the Law Library.

It’s about time that these irresponsible and dishonest acts
stopped. We are 100 per cent behind any measures the SBA

or library committee fell necessary to stop these offenses.

 

Registration Figures Released;
Total Enrollment, Failures Noted

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Washington and Lee University
has a total enrollment of 1185 men
for the present academic semester,
an increase of 22 over the 1960-61
total of 1163, according to final reg-
istration figures.

Of this years total, 1058 are un-
dergraduates in the School of Arts
and Sciences and 127 are law stu-
dents.

Freshmen this year number 315.

The present construction of new
freshmen dormitories, which neces-
sitated destruction of old dorms, has
caused a housing problem for fresh-
men.

Frosh Dorm Filled

Freshman Dormitory is filled to
capacity with 293 men. Baker Dorm
houses eight freshmen; 7 University
Place, seven; and private homes in

 

Lexington, five. Two freshmen live
in their own homes and attend W&L
as day students.

The freshmen who live off campus
are primarily late acceptances who
were unable to get dormitory facili-
ties. Some of the men, however, were
allowed to choose off-campus resi-
dences due to the scarcity of dorm
rooms.

Davis Dorm, the law dormitory,
houses 22 law students. The re-
remainder of the men in that college
live either in private homes or fra-
ternity houses.

As most law students are married,
the number living in fraternity hous-
es is small. Two law students live
in the Freshman Dormitory as
counselors.

Perhaps as a note of warning to
the freshman class, Dean’s Pusey’s

WGL Epic Series

ODK Circle:
Mute Reminder
Of Golden Age

The Friday Resarch Staff

(Editor’s note—In cooperation
with the Assimilation Committee,
we will from time to time publish
historical monographs on well-
known campus architectural fea-
tures. This week we are publishing
a critical history of the ODK circle.)

This year’s entering freshmen will
certainly have noticed the circle of
stone benches which stands beside
the walk from the Freshman Dorm
to the colonnade, in front of the
haunted house known as “the old
Co-op.”

The circle of benches was given
the University by the National So-
ciety of Omicron Delta Kappa in
1949, on the occasion of Washing-
ton and Lee’s 200th Anniversary.

In the center of the circle is an
ODK key. This key is the only
original ODK key extant. The Na-
tional Society decided to enshrine it
here as a reminder that the Minks
of bygone ages were great men in-
deed. It rests here at Washington
and Lee, a mute reminder of a
glorious golden age, a day when
heroes attended W&L, when gods
walked with men.

We know from the writings of an
obscure chronicler, a Calyx writer
whose name has been lost to poster-
ity, that this key belonged to one
Cyrus Studly.

Studly first came to W&L as
prince of a band of watermen from
White Marsh, Virginia, in the Year
of the Brawl at the Liquid (old
Liquid chronicles indicate a great
pitched battle took place between
the rival tribes of Mink and Wahoo
in 1911).

The Watermen, possessors of a
technologically superior culture, soon
rose to dominate the University.

Studly himself became captain of
the football team, president of the
student body, and town manager of
Lexington. His right-hand man, one
Ivan Perkins, became patriarch of
the University Christian Association,
a position of some influence when
church and state were not yet sep-
arated here.

We know no more of the feats of
Studly beyond a small note in the
Sweet Briar chronicle which indi-
cates he often led raiding parties
over the mountains and was finally
bought off by being made rector of
their Board of Trustees. In addi-
tion, each year he was sent the
pick of young womanhood of Am-
herst to serve in his palace on
Red Square.

Old Minks often pause by the
ODK circle during homecomings
weekend to pour out a small liba-
tion and to meditate on the decline
of the University. Men of the stature
of Studly no longer appear on the
rolls here.

Peasant tradition in this area has
it that once a year, during Fancy
Dress, the mighty Studly’s ghost
walks the campus, seeking a man
who can wear his key.

Symptomatic of the decline of
W&L have been the uses to which
the ODK circle was put after it
was built.

Once the mighty Minks stalked
the campus, seeking to prove their
prowess at arms, now the ODK
circle became a scene of gambling.

At first it had been a place where
new students might sit at the knees
of their elders and learn the tra-
ditions of the University.

But soon the elders lost sight of
their duty and, avaricious, sought to
engage the younger men in penny-
pitching. For a target they used the
great key which Studly had worn
on his forays to Sweet Briar and
Charlottesville, which had been in
the vanguard of so many battles at
which W&L’s honor was upheld.

The penny-pitching contests be-
came more and more sophisticated.
Some forty variations on the basic
game were recorded by one student
of those times. Where once students
had applied themselves diligently
to their studies, they spent all their
time practicing with pennies.

The great Alfred McCarrick, who
is even now half-legendary, is said
to have cut two back-to-back hour
quizzes when the stakes in a sudden-
death play-off in which he was en-
gaged rose to many dollars.

Fortunately for the morals of the
student body, the Co-op, which, in
its location right before the ODK
circle, had fomented this nefarious
activity, was moved to its present
location.

So once more the ODK circle
serves its original, semi-religious
purpose. It remains a shrine at
which each student generation is re-
minded of the glorious past of the

 

 

University and emboldened to strive
even harder for manly ideals.

Radio W&XL Plans Language Lab;
Classes Held For Frosh Members

By RANDALL JONES

Boasting more members than ever
before, the staff of Radio Washing-
ton and Lee will start the new sea-
son Monday night with several en-
tirely new features.

With 45 freshmen vying for po-
sitions, Program Coordinator Nick
Denton feels that with basically the
same show set-up, the increased
staff will enable him to appoint sev-
eral long-needed script researchers
and to build an engineering reserve.

A series of announcing and engi-
neering classes are now being held
to familiarize freshmen with the bas-
ic mechanics of radio broadcasting.

Plan Language Lab

Radio W&L expects good response
to a weekly language lab which will
allot an hour’s time to the French,
Spanish, German, and Russian de-

partments.
The show, scheduled to begin
within two weeks, will feature

poetry, drama, songs, folk tales
and panel discussions in each lan-
guage. It is impossible to cover these

 

areas in class, so the programs are
designed to give students a more
lucid picture of the foreign language
they are studying.

Proposed second semester shows
feature a musical nightclub tour
of major U.S. cities and a show of
experiments in sound, Kaliedoscope.
More familiar musical shows will
include: Pro-Musica, Concert, Pat-
terns, and Jazz Echoes which will
all rely on the 1500 album library
which is always growing through
subscription services.

All programs are planned by the
staff and broadcast by student di-
rectors Peter Lynn, Steve Guild,
Nick Denton and Thorns Craven.
Program broadcasting hours are
from 8-9 p.m. on Monday through
Thursday while news casts are heard
from 9:40-10 p.m. five times a week.

The Home Edition News Show,
headed by news director Clarence
Renshaw, is a week night report and
review of world and local news
compiled from the Associated Press
and local scources.

 

Berlin Crisis: Opinions Differ

To the Editor:

The first great debate has already
been held on campus, I think.
Whether it was the first is uncer-
tain. At the present time all we as
students know about our Executive
Committee is what they themselves
wish us to know, and there is the
rub.

The recent debate centered around
letting in one reporter from the
R-t P who would be allowed to
write a report on the regular EC
meeting. The discussion in the EC
was postponed until the represen-
tatives from the two freshmen class-
es, undergraduate and law, are sit-
ting with the body. This would also
allow more time to mull over the
ramifications of making such a move.

But what a gesture if such a
measure were subsequently inacted!
One mere reporter who would have
undisputed license to report what
he observed. But, I ask, what of
that which he was unaware or made
a subtle value judgment upon or
delegated as unnewsworthy?

Not to disparage reporters. All
they can do is give the 5 W’s and
one H and build it into a story. The
difficulty is in the building or writ-

between East and West, and the
prevalent attitude in America is that
the outcome of this dilemma will be
the determining factor in the future
of the free world.

What are the reactions of the
people of Western Europe to the
Communist threat in Berlin? Do
they feel as we do, that Berlin
is a “do or die” issue?

I had the opportunity this sum-
mer to speak to people from Berlin
to Rome about the Berlin Crisis.
These people know the horrors and
cruelties of war, and have seen
both Hitler’s and Stalin’s military
machine ravage their homeland. Yet,
the reactions of these people who
have known war are varied and di-
verse, and their solutions are di-
vergent and various.

West Berlin

In West Berlin itself, the citizens
go out of their way to impress upon
their American guests that they are
relying on Kennedy to be unremit-
ting and adamant in response to Mr.
K’s demands.

West Berliners have placed their
trust and faith in our President, and
feel that our promises to defend
the Western sector must be upheld,
or the prestige and power of the U.S.
as well as the West will fall ig-
nomiously. West Berliners are proud
of their achievements since World
War II, and they are ready to de-
fend at all costs their new found
freedom and heritage.

Austrian Reaction

A Viennese student I talked to is
of the opinion that we should for-
feit our rights in West Berlin and
give the Communists what is right-
fully theirs.

“Let the East Germans have Ber-
lin,” he says, “and then the West
can draw the line of Communism
at the Border between East and
West Germany.”

Another young Austrian argued
along the same line. “The West
would last about a week if war were
to break out in Berlin. The only
way the Western powers can fight
Russia here is diplomatically, for
the Communist military forces in
East Germany could overrun West
Berlin in no time.”

A young law student from Salz-
burg, Austria, differs completely

Cold Water
Flush For
Campus Club

By STEVE HENRY

The funniest article printed in
any Washington and Lee publication
of recent years appears not in a
copy of the Southern Collegian, but
rather in the 1961 W&L Handbook,
distributed to this year’s freshman
class.

For those of you have not been
fortunate enough to read this par-
ticular literary gem, we hereby take
it upon ourselves to reproduce it
for you, straight from page 80 of
the Handbook.

The title of the piece, which would
do justice to a Russian propagandist,
is “The Campus Club,” and it reads
as follows:

“From the loosely organized Non-
Fraternity Union there emerged a
few years ago the smaller, more
compact Campus Club, a unit com-
posed of all interested non-fraternity
men.

“It’s growth has been heartening;
for in its short lifetime the Club has
outfitted a lounge and recreation
facilities, participated successfully
in campus intra-murals and become
a leading contender and winner in
the campus-wide scholarship com-
petition.

“It has offered non-fraternity men
an opportunity for close personal
fellowship, a varied social program,
and spirited group creativity, while
remaining essentially an open club.

“The Campus Club looks to the
incoming class for much of its
leadership and welcomes every man
in the class of 1965 to Washington
and Lee.”

BULL. In capital letters, BULL!

Whoever wrote this masterpiece is
in dire trouble; he can be kicked
out of school at any minute for
distortion of the facts, commonly
called lying.

The entire spiel is a masterpiece
of distortion, designed primarily to
make good reading out of a bad
situation.

The only trouble is that some un-
knowing freshman might believe
what he reads in a_ supposedly
reputable campus publication.

He might even join the thing.

Well, let us tell you one thing
brother. Don’t believe everything
you read.

What we would like to know is
this: to whom has the growth of the
Campus Club been heartening?
Certainly not to the majority of
non-fraternity students on campus—
th very group that the good old CC
was organized for in the first place.

Here are a few particularly blunt
facts, which may not jibe with the
facts presented heretofore.

1. The Campus Club is not com-
posed of all interested non-fraterni-
ty men. As a matter of fact, most
interested non-fraternity men would
like to see an immediate cold-water
flush of the organization and all
that it stands for on this campus.

2. The Campus Club has not out-
fitted anything vaguely resembling
a lounge; there are no recreation
facilities (unless, that is, you like
to play checkers in the Student
Union); and Campus Club intramur-
al activities are nil. Participation in
I-M events by non-fraternity stu-
dents has been under the NFU
name, not under the Campus Club.

In fact, we know several boys,
who before participating in intra-
mural basketball last year, waited
until they were positive that they
were not going to be carrying the
Campus Club standard into play..

3. The Campus Club may have
offered non-fraternity students with
“an opportunity for close, personal
fellowship,” but we would not care
to define what the organization’s
meaning for the above quoted words
might denote. They might file a
legal suit against us.

4. A “varied social program” has
been offered. What an absurd joke.
The only social program for non-
fraternity students at W&L is pro-
vided by the fraternities, and cer-
tainly not by the university or by
the Campus Club. When was the
last time the Hot Nuts played in
the Student Union? Or were they
supposed to play in the trunk room
behind Davis Dorm?

There is, however, one truism in
the whole article. The Campus Club
is definitely “open.” Oh, ain’t it
open?

The person who wrote this tidbit
is wasting his time at this univer-
sity. He has a bright career awaiting
for him in advertising.

Anyone who could make the cam-
pus Club sound good could easily
sell iceboxes to Eskimos. In fact,
it should be easier all the way
around.

Men who expect to graduate in
February must make their degree
applications by 9 p.m. Monday.

Kick-off! Did it begin another undefeated season?

 

Defense Was Okay,
But Offense-Blah!

By STEVE HENRY

Sports

Editor

Washington and Lee’s defense against Hampden-Sydney
last Saturday was golden, but the offense, with the exception
of a third quarter touchdown drive, was strictly out to lunch.

Failure to hold blocks and an almost total lack of downfield

blocking made Hampden-Sydney’s*
defense look more potent than it
really was, according to W&L head
coach Lee McLaughlin.

“There just wasn’t any good
blocking going on except in the
third quarter,” he said. “Even then, it
was Suttle who kept us alive.”

Suttle was the brightest spot on
a dark day for Washington and Lee
offensive power.

He kept the Generals’ only sus-
tained drive going with a pair of
clutch passes that meant first downs
and eventually a touchdown.

Another back praised by Mc-
Laughlin was senior halfback Jim
Russ, who accounted for all seven
W&L points on a touchdown and
extra kick.

“Russ made all the plays for us,”
said McLaughlin.

And he did. On fourth down and
six at the Tigers’ 16, Russ leaped
high to catch a Suttle pass and make
it first and goal to go on the eight.

Seconds later, with a fourth down

and two yards for a touchdown, Russ | ¥*

bulled into the end zone for the
Generals only marker of the after-
noon.

Then he calmly added the extra
point that proved to be the win-
ning margin.

 

Defense, however, won the game
for the Generals.

Hampden-Sydney could never get
rolling against a W&L line and sec-
ondary that stopped almost every-
thing that the Tigers could come
up with.

McLaughlin singled out tackle
Bob Payne, back Wayne Bradshaw,
and linebacker Terry Fohs for their
defensive efforts.

“But it was a team effort all the
way on defense,’ he added. “We
can’t ask for anything else there.”

Offense is another story for the
Generals, however. Practice sessions
this week saw new emphasis on
blocking, especially beyond initial
contact in the line.

“We've got the backs to go,” Mc-
Laughlin said. “But they didn’t have
a chance to go far last week because
of the blocking.”

“If we get our blocking down,
we'll be tougher than last year.”

Golf Tryouts
Will Be Held

Qualification trials for the Wash-
ington and Lee golf team will be
held next Thursday and Friday at
the Lexington Country Club, ac-
cording to golf coach E. P. Twombly.

The fall try-outs are designed
to give Coach Twombly an idea
of how much talent he’ll have for
the spring golf season.

Six lettermren return from last
year’s squad that posted a 7-2 over-
all record and a fourth place show-
ing in the state collegiate tourna-
ment at Hot Springs, Va.

Twombly said that boys inter-
ested in playing this year should
contact him at his office in Doremus
Gymnasium before next Thursday.

Frosh Football

This Saturday

footballers open their seven
game schedule at Woodberry
Forest on Saturday with only
10 days practice. But if past

performance is any basis for pre-
diction, coach Dana Swan’s first
season should be a success, for he
has a strong nucleus of high school
and prep school stars to work with.

Speedy and explosive running are
the characteristics of the frosh
backfield. Skipper Chase, who was
named most valuable player in the
All Central Kentucky Conference
last year when he played for Frank-
fort High School, speedy Bill Jami-
son, and Bill Lee are men to watch
in the halfback position.

Fullbacks Ed Bradberry and Dan
Manson add power up the middle.
In the quarterback slot, the Baby
Generals have three fine perform-
ers in Doug Davis, Sam Simpson
and Gordon Gay. .

Coach Swan’s major problems
have been in the line where the
all-important defensive tackle spot
is especially weak. But after watch-
ing his defensive unit in an hour-
long scrimmage Tuesday, he com-
mented, “That’s what we needed—
some rough, tough, hungry tackles.”

The scrimmage uncovered three
tackles—a surprise Swan wasn’t ex-
pecting. Jack Moore, a 180 pound
guard, playing tackle for the first
time Tuesday was the best of the
new recruits. “The defensive tackles

The Washington and Lee varsity
soccer squad opened its 1961 season
against Pfeiffer College this after-
noon in Misenheimer, North Caro-
lina.

Coach Joe Lyles, who called
Pfeiffer “better than last year” when
the Generals won easily, said that
he was counting heavily on fresh-
man performers to bolster his
squad’s performance this year.

Freshmen Steve Hibbard, Pete
Preston, and Charlie Sweet have all
looked good in practice sessions,
and are challenging for starting po-
sitions on the squad.

Lyles says that his freshmen will
have to come through if the booters
are to post a winning mark this
year.

In addition to the frosh prospects,
Lyles has a nucleus of veterans re-
turning from his 1960 edition.

Bruce Jackson, one of the brightest
soccer prospects in recent years,
heads Coach Lyles’ freshman boot-
ers, who will have to support a nu-
cleus of returning veterans if this

year’s team is to post another win-
ning mark.

Lettermen returning include co-
captains Harry Preston and Dun-
lop Ecker, Jim Starkey, Bill Outman,
Charley Begg, Bob Pagano, Dave
Knight, Lou Mongeau, and Mike
Keating.

The Generals’ next game is set
for October 2 against Randolph-
Maccon college here. Game time is
3:45 p.m.

Other opponents this year include
North Carolina, Duke, North Caro-
lina State, Virginia, and Lynchburg.

Fata Morgana, a girl of such sophistication, such poise, such
savoir-faire as Rock had never beheld. She spoke knowingly of
Franz Kafka, she hummed Mozart, she smoked Marlboros.

 

“Soll cao bik re wo Be Stomach tea lke.”

Now, Rock didn’t know Franz Kafka from Pancho Villa, or
Mozart from James K. Polk, but Marlboros he knew full well.
He knew that anyone who smoked Marlboros was modern and
advanced and as studded with brains as a ham with cloves.
Good sense tells you that you can’t beat Marlboro’s exclusive
selectrate filter, and you never could beat Marlboro’s fine flavor.
This Rock knew.

So all day he followed Fata around campus and listened to her
talk about Franz Kafka, and then in the evening he went back
to the dormitory and found this letter from his home town
sweetheart Tess:

Dear Rock,

Us kids had a keen time yesterday. We went down to the
pond and caught some frogs. I caught the most of anybody.
Then we hitched rides on trucks and did lots of nutsy stuff
like that. Well, I must close now because I got to whitewash
the fence.

Your friend,
Tess
P.S.—I can do my Hula Hoop 8,000 times.

Well sir, Rock thought about Tess and then he thought
about Fata and then a great sadness fell upon him. Suddenly
he knew he had outgrown young, innocent Tess; his heart now
belonged to smart, sophisticated Fata.

Rock, being above all things honorable, returned forthwith
to his home town and walked up to Tess and looked her in the
eve and said manlily, “I do not love you any more. I love a
girl named Fata Morgana. You can hit me in the stomach with
all your might if you like.”

“That’s okay, hey,” said Tess amiably. “I don’t love you
neither. I found a new boy.”

“What is his name?” asked Rock.

“Franz Kafka,” said Tess.

“A splendid fellow,” said Rock and shook Tess’s hand, and
they have remained good friends to this day. In fact, Rock and
Fata often double-date with Franz and Tess and have heaps of
fun. Franz can do the Hula Hoop 6,000 times. :

1961, drop-outs for academic reasons.
At that time 11 freshmen and 26
upperclassmen were dismissed from
school under the automatic rule.

Dean Pusey said the figures did
not include the February and mid-
semester drop-outs. No figures were
available on these.

This year 27 students are return-
ing to Washington and Lee after
being enrolled some time prior to
the 1960-61 academic year without
getting a degree.

Figures for returnees continuing
their education here after a time
lapse have not been compiled. Some
fell under the automatic rule, some
had financial or personal problems
which postponed their education.

W&L students come from 48 of
the 50 states and seven foreign
countries including Italy, Mexico,
Bolivia, Sweden, Scotland, Canada,
and England.

As usual, Virginia has the most

aside and left secret to protect the
parties concerned, but who is pro-
tected by the secrecy of E.C. meet-

A policy of secrecy is detrimental
to all concerned, represented and

resented to walk or drive by the
Student Union on the appointed
meeting night, observe the burning
lights and parked cars of EC mem-
bers, and wonder just what is go-

It is only a statement of fact that
some changes will be made this year.
As reported elsewhere in this paper
there is a complete proposed con-
stitution which merits a great deal
of consideration. There are also those
ideas fomented by last year’s po-
litical campaign which demand ac-
tion. Only by having the opportuni-
ty to understand and become aware
of these issues and their ramifica-
tions can the student body and their
representatives intelligently make
their decisions.

How, that ugly little work as
Henry James once said, is fairly ob-
vious; at least the first How con-
sists of awareness and knowledge.
The established order is too often
looked on by those desirous of
change and those unfamiliar yet
incitable as something which is bad.
Our constitution and student gov-
ernment is essentially good. But
without knowledgeable and reason-
ed inquiry all might be lost.

Loan Paintings on Exhibit Here

Nineteen paintings from the Cin-
cinnati Museum of Fine Arts have
been placed on display in Evans
dining hall.

The paintings, on loan from the
Ohio museum for the first semester,
were first shown Saturday to visit-
ing members of the Virginia Foun-
dation of Independent Colleges. The
exhibition was opened to the pub-
lic earlier this week, according to
Dr. Marion Junkin, chairman of the
university’s department of fine arts.

The collection, which includes
works by William Meritt Chase and
Arthur B. Davies, was assembled
this summer by Dr. Junkin and
Cincinnati Museum Director Phillip
Adams. It is the first such loan made
to Washington and Lee by this
museum.

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Concert Guild will open its
series of programs on Thursday,
Oct. 5 in Lee Chapel presenting Bela
Szilagi, pianist. Five other concerts
in the series include Oscar Mc-
Cullough, baritone, Nov. 17; Marcia
Baldwin, meza-soprano, Feb. 16; The
Carnegie String Quartet, April 18. A
sixth program will be announced.

Bela Szilagi was born in New
York City, March 1934, of Hungarian
desgeent. He began the study of piano
at nine, making his first public ap-
pearance when he was 12. He re-
ceived a scholarship from the Juil-
liard School of Music and studied
with Jane Carlson and Sascha Go-
rodnitzki.

In 1955, Mr. Szilagi toured the
United States as conductor for the
Medium and The Telephone, with
Marie Powers and Emmanuel Bala-
ban. The following year he toured
Europe with the violinist, Joyce
Flissler, performing more than 50
concerts.

By the unanimous decision of the
judges, in April 1960, he received
the Jugg Award, which was present-
ed in a Town Hall debut in March
1961.

Hall when it opened in 1959 as part
of a continuing effort to acquaint
the Washington and Lee student
body with different periods of art.
Last year, a collection from the
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in
New York was displayed for six
months.
Diversity of Subjects

“We've had a number of modern
paintings in past exhibitions,’ Dr.
Junkin noted, “However, there’s a
wide diversity of subjects in this
Cincinnati collection. Among these
19 paintings are represented some
of the best of the painters of the
first quarter of this century.”

In addition to Chase and Davies,
the exhibition includes works by
Henry Mattson, Frank Benson, Emil
Bisttram, Robert D. Kaufman, David
Fredenthal, Buffie Johnson, Maxime

Plans for exhibitions in Washing-
ton and Lee’s duPont Art Gallery
have not yet been completed, Dr.

with their view. “The Americans
could defend Berlin if they were
forced to. Anyway the Austrians are
not going to fight. We’re neutral
and I like it. We’re too small to play
an important role in world affairs,
and I don’t want to go to war for
anybody.”
U. S. Must Catch Up

A middle aged school teacher in
Vienna thinks that America must
“catch up” with the Russians before
we can make a forceful stand on
the Berlin issue.

In Rome a young Italian bartender
probably expressed the general
opinion of many Americans as well
as Europeans.

“Berlin, hell that’s a mess. Some-
thing’s got to be done, but what?
Who knows?

Paul States Objectives In Revamping Constitution

(Continued from page 1)

“My second objective was to im-
prove the prose of the constitution,
to write it on a more collegiate level.
I feel that our present constitution
does not express itself clearly and
with force.

“Finally, I felt that there were
several innovations which needed
to be made. The most important of
these are the adoption of a poll
tax, and the use of tests to determine
leadership ability.”

The proposed constitution would
have each student who desired vot-
ing privileges pay $2.00 when he
matriculated at the first of the year.
This money would then be refunded
when the student voted.

“This is not a tax, but a deposit.
Its sole purpose is to encourage
student interest in campus elections,”
said Paul.

Paul also proposes that tests be
used to judge a student’s qualifica-

 

Shenandoah To Appear

The Fall issue of Shenandoah, the
Washington and Lee literary maga-
zine, will concentrate on “the crea-
tive aspects of Southern fiction and
poetry,” according to Dr. Marshall
Fishwick, the editor of the current
issue.

The Fall issue, which is waiting to
be printed, will not be out for a few
weeks.

Thomas Russell, who is reference
librarian in the Cyrus McCormick
library here, has contributed a poem,
“Spengler Limited.”

Dr. Fishwick was assisted in the
editing of the current issue by
sophomore Robert Mottley, who has
contributed an essay on “Boris
Pasternak: The Late Phase.”

tions for office. These tests would be
used only as a further means to
judge a candidates ability, and would
not be a final authority.

“For two thousand years, men
have chosen their leaders on second-
hand information. Now, with ad-
vances in science, it seems that we
can use tests to improve our know-
ledge of a candidate’s abilities.

“In other words, there might be a
better way to elect officials, and this
could be it. It’s worth a try.”

 

Fall Debate Scheduled

(Continued from page 1)
will be debated by Washington and
Lee men in intercollegiate tourna-
ments.

Tentative contests for the W&L
team are set for Franklin and Mar-
shall College, Oct. 19-20; Univer-
sity of South Carolina, Nov. 9-11;
and a state tournament Nov. 17-18,
at Bridgewater, Va.

The debate team held its initial
meeting of the year Tuesday night
with a freshman-dominated turnout
of 48 students.

Mr. Chaffin, advisor to the debate
society, said he “hopes for” an ac-
tive membership of sixty students in
the group. Persons who did not at-
tend the organizational meeting may
see him in his office, Payne 32.

Tentative installation of a local
chapter of Tau Kappa Alpha, na-
tional debate fraternity, is scheduled
for Thursday, Nov. 2.

Irish Critic Speaks

 

Pleasure Aspect Of Fiction
Is Subject Of O’Faolain Talk

 

By TOM LYBASS
Associate Editor

How does one gain pleasure from
reading fiction?

This question Sean O’Faolain, Irish
writer and critic, discussed last night
in a lecture in Lee Chapel.

“In reading,” Mr. O’Faolain said,
“there is a certain projection be-
tween the book and the subject
beholding the book. It is by this
projection that the reader takes out
the pleasure locked up in the book.”

“Alloyed Pleasure”

Calling the projection form of
reading “alloyed pleasure,” Mr.
O’Faolain classified novelists as be-
ing either one of two types, either
a writer of novels giving pleasure
of the alloyed kind or a writer of
novels that does not give alloyed
pleasure.

Mr. O’Faolain said that alloyed
pleasure, which “allows one to alter
and modify what one reads and
sometimes to take out of a novel
what’s not in it,’ can be derived
from reading such writers as Dos-
toevsky, Conrad, James, and Colette.

Not Under Control

“The alloyed novelist’s personality
is not under control. He is only
getting affects by playing around.
Dostoevsky was one who allowed
himself to be carried on. Conrad is
also not clearheaded.”

“The great Stendhal and Abbe
Prevost are two writers that are
not alloyed. They cannot be ap-
proached on any account. While
reading them, it is impossible to
pour in our complexes and preju-
dices and take out more than the
author put in.”

Citing Joyce’s Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man as another
work of the unalloyed kind, Mr.
O’Faolain said, “It is the perfect
account of the agony of being young.
It is impossible to corrupt.”

Four Main Types
Mr. O’Faolain divided novels into
four main types: social, moralist, in-
terpretation, and unclassified.

“The social novel is the great
English forte, while the moralist
novel, which shows men living by a
technique of their own, as the great
quality of the French mind,” Mr.
O'Faolain said.

“Prophetic Quality”

Republicans, Conservatives Hold Meetings

By C. C. FLIPPEN
Associatee Editor

Student political groups will kickoff their new
school year activities with organizational meetings this
week.

The Washington and Lee Young Republicans meet
tonight at 7 in the Student Union. The meeting will be
held before the freshman assembly.

Among the speakers will be Hank Oder, Rock-
bridge County Republican Chairman; Craig Distlehorst,
Region III Chairman of Organization for the Young
Republicans; and Charles Wright, the Virginia Vice
Chairman.

Oder will discuss the present gubernatorial race
in Virginia and how W&L Young Republicans can
participate. Distlehorst and Wright plan talks on the
Young Republican organization from the college to
the national level. A report will also be given on
the Young Republicans Convention held during the
past summer.

Committee To Be Formed

A nomination committee, composed of those who
wish to run for office or desire to serve on the com-
mittee, is to be formed. The committee will form an
election program, and elections will be held at the
next meeting.

Among the new activities slated by the club for this
year is a newspaper, which the club hopes will provide
a sounding board for student opinion on events of
national and international significance. The club also
hopes that political events on campus may be given
fuller discussion and coverage through the paper.

To Present Series
Following the gubernatorial election next month the

group, working with the United States Chamber of
Commerce, will present a series of discussions on prac-
tical polities. Guest speakers will be invited to guide
these discussions.

The club invites all student Republicans to attend
this first organizational meeting, even if they feel they
will not have time to actively participate in the club.
An inactive membership list will be drawn from these
students, and they will receive Republican announce-
ments.

Conservative Society

Also meeting this week is the newly formed Con-
servative Society of W&L. The society will hold its
opening meeting at 7 p.m. Wednesday in duPont
auditorium.

The aim of the Conservative Society is to provide
“a medium through which interested students can ex-
press their views on conservative government.”

At the Wednesday meeting the new group’s leaders
will endeavor to explain further the aims and ideals
of the organization to all interested newcomers. The
group’s program for the coming semester will also be
discussed at this meeting.

“Uncas” McThenia, Society vice president, said that
the meeting is open to all who are interested in the
conservative philosophy of government; the student
body, townspeople, or other interested outsiders. Mc-
Thenia also said he expects a large turn-out for the
opening meeting.

Film To Be Shown

It was also announced that the film Communist
Encirclement 1961 will be shown Wednesday.

The conservative organization plans to establish a
speaker’s forum to bring to the campus prominent
conservative scholars, politicians and journalists.

‘Emphasis Abroad’ Program
Will Make Debut Wednesday
On Radio Washington And Lee

By STEVE GUILD

News Editor
which began its 1961-62 season

last night, will have a new look in programming this year.

* The schedule of shows has been
rearranged and an entirely new
foreign language show will make its
debut Wednesday.

The new show, Emphasis Abroad,
will be a foreign language cultural
show, which will feature a variety of
artists and performers connected
with several foreign countries.

The first show will survey the
popular music of France, including
such performers as Juliette Greco,
Yves Montand, and Maurice Che-
valier.

Producer Nick Denton stated that
“the purpose of the show is to add
to our
program which will appeal to stu-
dents, faculty, and other listeners.
We plan to have future shows based
on interviews, analyses, and special
reviews, in addition to the popular
music segments.”

The show will originate from the
studios of Radio Washington and Lee
and will be planned, produced, and
directed by the staff of Radio W&L,
with the cooperation of interested
faculty members and students.

The other programs on the Radio
Washington and Lee schedule will
be basically the same this year as
in the past. Pre Musica, the Monday
night show, will be produced by
Peter Lynn. The program for the
show will consist of heavy classical
music, opera, and contemporary
composers. Engineers for Monday
night are Lynn Hammond and Til-

Openings To Feature Clovers

Dave Montgomery To Be Honored
At Openings Cocktail Party

By KEN LANE and JACK DeJARNETTE
Tuesday Staff Writers

The Clovers, backed up by the sounds of the Dukes of
Rhythm, will highlight the Delt’s cocktail party on Friday of
Openings Weekend, it was announced today.

Consisting of five singers and an instrumentalist, the Clov-

ers have held the spotlight in

55 Freshmen Eligible
For Deferred Rush;
Combo Costs Studied

By T. D. EDWARDS
Associate Editor
IFC President Bob Doenges an-
nounced last night at the IFC meet-
ing that 55 freshmen are eligible for
deferred rush.

The names of the freshmen that
are interested in the fraternities can
not be published under IFC rules,
he said, and urged all the rush
chairmen to go by the Dean’s office
to get their fraternity’s copy.

Beginning on October 18, which is
four weeks after the official end of
rush week, deferred rush will con-
tinue throughout the year.

To Petition Faculty

In view of the short period be-
tween Thanksgiving and Christmas
holidays, Steve Rutledge, Phi Gam
president, proposed that the IFC
president appear before the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities and re-
quest that eight fraternities be al-
lowed to have house parties on the
weekend of December 2 and that
eight more be allowed to have
parties on the following weekend.
The rule now states that only five
houses are allowed parties on any
one weekend.

Should the request be denied by
the committee, it was pointed out,
only ten of the fraternities will be
able to have parties in accordance
with the present limit on the num-
ber of parties. Two fraternities in-
dicated that they are not planning
any Christmas activity.

Homecomings To Feature
Changes, Innovations

For the first time in recent years,
Homecomings and Openings Dances
will be combined into a single week-
end.

Another innovation will be the pep
rally to be held outside the gym-
nasium on Friday night of that
weekend. At this rally, the Home-
coming Queen will be chosen.

Because of the combined weekend,
fraternities are encouraged to have
their decorations finished by 4 p.m.
Friday 13th. The decorations will
be judged between 4 p.m. and mid-

| night.

This year a student committee is
assisting the Alumni Secretary and
the Dance Board in preparations
for the weekend,

 

the popular music field since

*their first recording in 1950.

Some of their outstanding releases
are “Love Love Love,” “Middle of
the Night,” and “Devil or Angel.”
Noted for their versatility, this group
has put out five successful albums,
and has performed concerts through-
out the country.

Still composed of its original mem-
bers, John (Buddy) Bailey and Billy
Mitchell, lead tenors, Matt Mc-
Quater, second tenor, Hal Lucas, Jr.,
baritone, Hal Winley, bass, and Bill
Harris, instrumentalist, the Clovers
have enjoyed undiminished popular-
ity during their eleven-year career.
Originating in the Washington-Bal-
timore area, they quickly gained
prominence in the music world with
a style similar to that of the Platters.

“The Clovers take the music and
the words and balance them delight-
fully somewhere between rhythm
and feeling, and the resulting rendi-
tion leaves in your ears the delicate
aftertaste of an expertly seasoned
ragout...’, comments columnist Les
Matthews of the New York Age
Defenders.

The cocktail party is begin given
in honor of Delt junior Dave Mont-
gomery, President of Openings
Dance. It will take place in the
Mayflower Hotel, October 13th, from
4 until 6 p.m.

The Faculty Social Committee
has announced its decision on the
requirements for dress at the
Openings Dance on _ Saturday,
October 14.

They have stated that dress will
be semi-formal. No polished cot-
tons or tennis sneakers will be al-
lowed at the dance Saturday.
Girls will be required to wear
cocktail dresses. The Floor Com-
mittee will reserve the right to
turn away anyone who is not in
suitable dress.

Delt Senior and Social Chairman
Will Lee states that this should be
one of the first truly successful
big weekend cocktail parties. “Usu-
ally,” Lee recalls, “there is such a
crowd that you can’t hear what’s
going on; it’s a big waste of talent.”

This year, Lee has planned to
install 13 or 14 big amplifiers to
help out the acoustics. In addition
a new bandstand is going to be built.
“Also,” Lee added, “the brew will
be of a finer quality than usual—
the best scotch and bourbon we ean
get.”

The Delt cocktail party is the first
of many events scheduled for Open-
ings Weekend. At eight o’clock in
the gym, Hank Ballard and his
Midnighters, the Edsels, and the
Isley Brothers will give a concert.
Hank Ballard is well known for his
hit records, “Annie Had a Baby,”
“Sexy Ways,” “Henry’s Got Flat

LEADERSHIP TESTS? NO!
(Continued from page 1)

 

The second area in the proposed revision which we disagree
with is the idea of leadership tests. Such tests would be given
candidates to determine their “intelligence and general ability;
initiative; resourcefulness and creative ability; and leadership
ability.” To this suggestion we feel we must say that this area
has little or no value to us at all.

The idea that the results of the tests be publicly posted and
written on all the ballots appears to us as being a blow to the
candidate’s integrity and to his good name. Under this pro-
posed system the candidates will become the object of ridicule
and cynicism.

We need leaders—men with good ideas and good
heads—not some “goons” or “‘eggheads” who may happen
to score perfect on a test which we feel could not possibly
determine a candidate’s leadership ability that will be dem-
onstrated in some future office.

We sincerely doubt the validity of such test—and we en-
dorse the belief that this proposal is also “absurd and that it
is further a ridiculous, unnecessary and, above all, a senseless
move.”

It must be realized that the political parties will only sup-
port and endorse qualified candidates. (It’s sure suicide if the
parties don’t push men with both excellent academic and cam-
pus standings.) We must have faith in our parties and in our
candidates! If we lose this basic faith in our chosen parties,
then we stand to become people who are “. . . full of sound and
fury, signifying nothing.”

We feel that Mr. Paul’s proposal also has its good sides.
His suggestion that the legislative meetings be open to the
press we feel is excellent, and we endorse this idea whole-
heartedly. We agree with him that there is no need for the
constitution to give a long and drawn out explanation con-
cerning the election of cheerleaders and members of the
Cotillion Club. These suggestions merit serious consideration
by the Executive Committee.

Changes, as we have said, must be warranted. Change
should never be initiated merely for the sake of change itself.
This type of irresponsible action leads only to real trouble. The
poll tax and the leadership tests do not represent the best
means for electing our officials. We only hope that the Execu-
tive Committee will agree.

SERIES OF AMENDMENTS ISN’T THE ANSWER

If the E. C. wants to strengthen its position on this campus,
and if the E. C. feels that organizations such as the Student
Library Committee, the Assimilation Committee and the
Cold Check Committee need more power, then we say give
these committees the power to act.

Reformers, don’t tie the E. C.’s hands with shouts of
“constitutional ammendment” every time someone unlaw-
check, or fails to wear his beanie, or everytime someone unlaw-
fully removes a book from the library.

As the Friday Edition said, “These needs will not be met
by constitutional ammendments but rather by more imaginative
use of the influence of the Executive Committee.”

We hope that students won’t resort to this “sound and
fury” over the constitution at every turn in the road of legisla-
tion.

Let us forget such proposals as the poll tax and the leader-
ship tests. Let us move to more important matters. Let us regain
our senses when it comes to matters concerning the Executive
Committee, our student body organization which safeguards
our most cherished traditions. Let us once again have faith in
those we have elected. Let us once again see that intelligent
change is the correct answer—the only answer that will work.

STUDENT INTEREST NEEDED

Two of Washington and Lee’s newest clubs will hold their
meetings tonight and tomorrow. We are speaking of the newly
formed Young Republicans and the Conservative Society.

It is our hope that Washington and Lee students will both
join and support these clubs. The persons who have organized
these clubs have put much effort into them. It would indeed be
a shame if these clubs failed due to a lack of student support.
Good luck politicians!

Taking a giant step toward fulfill-

ment of Washington and Lee’s rapid-

ly 11,0000 W&L alumni.

 

As Others See Us

Poll Reveals:
Hollins
Likes W&L

By Ring-tum Phi Staff
Hollins College Bureau

Well, Gentlemen, Hollins’ girls ap-
prove of us.

Our roving reporter at Hollins
asked 30 girls there, “Do you like
W&L?”

Fifteen indicated they liked W&L
and twelve didn’t like W&L. (The
other three were fish and don’t
count.)

Why do these 15 girls like W&L?
Well...

I. “It’s fun if you know the boys
in the house you are dating.”

2. “It’s enjoyable if you’re with
the right person, otherwise it’s bet-
ter to go up North.”

3. The combos are fabulous and
the parties are a lot of fun.”

4. “W&L is close and we can go
there without taking overnights.” (A
sly reason if there ever was one).

5. “The boys are nice and we
hear they dress nicely.”

6. “It’s a better way to spend
Saturday night than in the library.”
(Yeh, man or woman!)

7. “The boys themselves are nice,
but when they get together, they
act like a bunch of idiots. They
put on false fronts and spend their
time seeing who can drink the
most.”

8. “It’s fun, but then, I haven’t
been there very much.”

9. “I like it, but not as much as
Virginia.” (True Southern lass.)

10 “The boys there are smarter
than the ones at Vriginia.” (That'll
show those Wahoos.)

11. “They are a lot of fun if they
don’t get drunk and attack their
dates.” (Wolf, Wolf.)

On the other side of the fence
were those who don’t like W&L
because...

1. “There are absolutely no indi-
viduals at W&L.”

(Continued on page 4)

 

 

Alumni secretary Bill Washburn
said the occupational file is being
established “so that we can answer
the ever-growing number of queries
we receive concerning the quality
of our products—that is, the individ-
ual contributions being made to so-
ciety by Washington and Lee gradu-
ates.”

Washburn explained that occu-
pational records are used by many
large philantrophic foundations as
a criteria for awarding of grants
and funds.

“After our files are established
we will be able to tell them exactly
how many of our graduates are
doctors, lawyers, businessmen, jour-
nalists, teachers, and so on. And we
are confident that the information
will be impressive,’ Washburn
stated.

At present, according to Wash-
burn, the alumni files list occupa-
tions, but is is virtually impossible
to compile a statistical breakdown,
and, even if a breakdown were pos-
sible, the information would be over
14 years out of date.

To bring the files up to date and
in the form of a complete statistical
cataloging, the alumni association is
mailing forms to 11,000 W&L gradu-
ates, asking each alumnus to list the
firm or institution with which he is
associated, the type of business it
performs, and the position he holds
with the institution.

The alumnus is also asked to cata-
log his occupation under one of
fourteen general areas: accounting,
architecture, the arts, business and
industry, religion, communications
and entertainment, education, en-
gineering, government, medical arts,
health service, law, science, student
and miscellaneous.

Other information requested in-
cludes academic degree and major
subject, church affiliation, career
honors, and directorship or trus-
teeship positions.

Two pages of the form are blank,
with the alumnus urged to include
pertinent information about his oc-
cupation or his role in society on
these two pages.

“We realize that many men make
their main contribution to society
through community activity rather
than occupational activity, and of
course we are vitally interested in
this,’ Washburn said.

The Alumni Association plans
to follow up the original mailing
of this form with four or five per-
sonal letters to those alumni not
returning forms. Washburn said
this program should enable the As-

sociation to realize a return of be-
tween 75 and 80 per cent of the
forms, the figure which he termed
necessary for an accurate statisti-
cal breakdown.

W&L To Compile Complete Files
Of 11,000 Alumni’s Occupations

of Washington and Lee as an edu-
cational institution.

real important steps taken since

America ‘Like Home’
Says Paul Ojermark

‘But Cars Are Bigger, Roads Wider,
Buildings Taller, People Friendlier’

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Managing Editor

(Editor’s Note: This is the first in a series of articles about the
foreign students attending Washington and Lee this year.)

“Tt’s almost like home.”

That’s Gunner Paul Ojermark’s opinion of the United
States. Ojermark, from Saffle, Sweden, is one of seven foreign
students studying at Washington and Lee this year.

Ojermark, who speaks four lan- *

guages, is quite a traveler. He
has visited 10 European countries,
including France, Italy, England,
and Germany; Canada; and now
the United States.

“Going to a Southern European
country like France or Italy is like
entering a new world,” Ojermark
says. “But coming to the United
States is almost like being at home.”

Why is the United States like
home to Ojermark?

Well, most Americans don’t realize

Virginia has a new governor. He was elected in the
best Byrd tradition in the Democratic primary last
summer.

A. E. S. Stephens, who devoted his life (including
the last eight years as Lt. Governor) to service in the
politics of the Old Dominion didn’t
have a prayer of a chance. Now all
the voters have to do is put the
A-Okay on Albertis Harrison in
the November election.

The GOP also has a name on
the ballot, but I'll wager not one
in fifty voters in Virginia could tell
you who he is. And not one in a
hundred voters will mark the box
by his name.

RES IPSA_ LOQUITUR

 

Fortunately, however, I took a
little trip over the weekend to
see a big-time football game, and
I think a description of that spec-
tacle, plus a little description of
life on a co-ed campus, should
suffice for this week’s bedtime
story.

To begin with the game: You
should really see one once. TV really
doesn’t do them justice.

It’s almost like Ben-Hur. They
have bands with some people over
six feet tall, and no midgets at
all

At the one I saw they had a Civil
War battle at the half. No buses full
of Minks, no townie intramural
games, but an actual battle. It was
put on by a re-activated Confeder-
ate battalion.

Before Saturday I was sort of
worried about the draft, and the
activation of National Guard units,
and all that; but after seeing a
real Civil War unit—muskets and
moth-eaten uniforms included—
I'm really sweating it. ROTC is
doomed. And so are all us 2-S’s.

But I digress from the football
game. They also had chicks on
floats to ride around the field—in
bathing suits. Again, no buses, on
tanks from VMI, no Lexington High
School cross-country team, but
chicks in bikinis. They were all on
floats that said “Salute to Beauty,”
“Salute to Industry,” and one even
said “Salute to the American Way
of Life.” I caught the name of the
girl on that one—Rodriguez. What
a way of life!

Well, that was the game, so on to
the social life where boys go to
school with unmarried girls. After
the game each fraternity has a little
open house. I walked into one at
about eleven o’clock, and met the

house president. After exchanging
greetings, I said:

“Nice place you have here,
George. Where’s the bar?”
George said proudly: “Oh, we

have no bar. No drinking on this
campus.”

“Oh,” I said, swallowing hardly.
(Or was it hardly swallowing—I
can’t remember.)

Then I asked about women. With
a subtle touch, I said:

“Well, how about women? Can
I get one for the rest of the party?”

George said: “Sure, they outnum-
ber the boys here, or it wouldn’t be
any use. They have to be in at

it, but Sweden is the most “Amer-
icanized” country in Europe.

Like most American teenagers,
the young Swedes have cars in
high school, like rock ’n’ roll,
and dance on weekends, and gen-
erally aren’t restricted in their so-
cial activities, Ojermark points out.

But of course, there are differ-
ences.

“In America the cars are bigger,
the roads wider and better, the
buildings taller, and the people
friendlier.

“The one thing that has impressed
me most so far is the friendliness
of the Americans. They are friend-
lier and more hospitable than any
other people I’ve met.”

* * *

WORLD ECONOMY and politics
fascinate Ojermark, who is studying
political science, economics, and
English at Washington and Lee.

“I find that the American students
are keenly aware of both their coun-
try’s political situation and the world
political situation. This is very im-
pressive because in Sweden this po-
litical awareness on the students’
part is lacking.”

Ojermark says he hasn’t decided
on his career, but it’s easy to tell
that he’s politically inclined.

“I might enter the international
political or economic field,” he says.
* + *
“POTATOES. I miss potatoes
most,” Ojermark said in answering
how he likes American food. “We
eat potatoes at least once every day,

but you don’t.

“But I do like the meat and salads
here. The meat is tender whereas
it’s usually tough in Europe.”

The weather is Ojermark’s only
disappointment.

“I wish it was a little warmer.
Maybe I should have gone to the
University of Miami (Florida),” he
says jokingly.

In the first quarter, W&L made
its biggest bid to break into the scor-
ing column, when they marched
eighty yards to the Woodberry one,
where they lost the ball on downs.

Late in the second quarter, Wood-
berry gained possession of the ball
inside the Baby Generals’ ten, after
a bad snap from center.

 

Woodberry scores

W&L’s small but spirited line held
them three times, but a short pass
from quarterback Tysner to right
end Hunter Spruill gave the home
team a 6-0 halftime lead.

The second half was a repeat of
the first as W&L continued to ad-
vance the ball into Woodberry’s ter-
ritory only to lose the ball because
of a fumble or an offsides penalty.

Woodberry added its final touch-
down midway in the third period
when halfback Bill Shawb raced
eighty after shaking off a would-be
W&L tackler.

After the game, Coach Swan said
he was as pleased as he could be,
under the circumstances, with the

 

team’s overall performance and that
the difference in the amount of pre-
season practice kept W&L from
victory.

He stressed the complete team
effort and ended by saying, “We
have the making of a good, hust-
ling ball club, and we will be
tough to beat in our remaining
games.”

The Baby Generals will play Fer-
rum Jr. College this Saturday.

Five Star Generals Face Franklin And Marshall;

“They are bigger than we in

Lee McLaughlin as he prepares to
lead his charges against Franklin

The coaching staff and the Five

their 11th straight game without a

Clements For Defensive Play

Tom Clements, a Phi Psi junior
from Bethlehem, Pa., has been
named Washington and Lee athlete

performance in the W&L-Pfeiffer
College soccer match Friday.

Coach Joe Lyles pointed out that
Clements’ “aggressive, rugged play”
enabled the Generals to give Pfeif-

There was no scoring in the final

SAIL ON, SAIL ON!

I suppose October 12 is just another day to you. You get up in
the ordinary way and do all the ordinary things you ordinarily
do. You have your breakfast, you walk your ocelot, you go to
classes, you write home for money, you burn the dean in effigy,
you watch Howdy-Doody, and you go to bed. And do you give
one little thought to the fact that October 12 is Columbus
Day? No, you do not.

Nobody thinks about Columbus these days. Let us, there-
fore, pause for a moment and retell his ever-glorious, endlessly
stirring saga.

(onus cree gn

Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa on August 25, 1451.
His father, Ralph T. Columbus, was in the three-minute auto
wash game. His mother, Eleanor (Swifty) Columbus, was a
sprinter. Christopher was an only child, except for his four
brothers and eight sisters. With his father busy all day at the
auto wash and his mother constantly away at track meets,
young Columbus was left pretty much to his own devices.
However, the lad did not sulk or brood. He was an avid reader
and spent all his waking hours immersed in a book. Unfortu-
nately, there was only one book in Genoa at the time—Care of
the Horse by Aristotle—and after several years of reading Care
of the Horse, Columbus grew restless. So when rumor reached
him that there was another book in Barcelona, off he ran as
fast as his fat little legs would carry him.

The rumor, alas, proved false. The only book in Barcelona
was Cuidar un Caballo by Aristotle, which proved to be nothing
more than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.

Bitterly disappointed, Columbus began to dream of going
to India where, according to legend, there were thousands of
books. But the only way to go to India was on horseback, and
after so many years of reading Care of the Horse, Columbus
never wanted to clap eyes on a horse again. Then a new thought
struck him: perhaps it was possible to get to India by sea!

Fired with his revolutionary new idea, Columbus raced to
the court of Ferdinand and Isabella on his little fat legs (Colum-
bus, though six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs all his
life) and pleaded his case with such fervor that the rulers were
persuaded.

On October 12, 1492, Columbus set foot on the New World.
The following year he returned to Spain with a cargo of wonders
never before seen in Europe—spices and metals and plants and
flowers and—most wondrous of all—tobacco! Oh, what a sensa-
tion tobacco caused in Europe! The filter had long since been
invented (by Aristotle, curiously enough) but nobody knew
what to do with it. Now Columbus, the Great Discoverer,
made still another great discovery: he took a filter, put tobacco
in front of it, and invented the world’s first filter cigarette!

Through the centuries filters have been steadily improved
and so has tobacco, until today we have achieved the ultimate
in the filter cigarette—Marlboro, of course! Oh, what a piece
of work is Marlboro! Great tobacco, great filter, great smoke!
And so, good friends, when next you enjoy a fine Marlboro
Cigarette, give a thought to the plucky Genoese, Christopher
Columbus, whose vision and perseverance made the whole
lovely thing possible.

© 1961 Max Shulman

And thank Columbus too for the king-size Philip Morris
Commander. If unfiltered cigarettes are your choice, you’ ll

find Commander the choice of the unfiltered. Welcome
aboard.

the controversial Virginia election laws that
“there is a great need in Virginia at this time

backed by the financial resources of the domi-
nant organization have been able to succeed in
the primaries or general elections...

Parsons Names Six Highest
Scores in Quiz Bowl Tests
To Determine WXL Team

Six men were named today
by Quiz Bowl director Frank
Parsons as having made out-
standing scores in preliminary

testing held to pick the Wash-
ington and Lee College Bowl

Four juniors, a sophomore, and a
senior comprise the group which at
present leads the pack in the race
for team positions. Mac Brownlee,
Jim Campbell, Bill Lowry, Harry
Meem, Tom Lybass, and Richard
Jones are the six.

Four men will make the trip to
represent W&L on network televi-

top six men on 170 questions which
he has given to the candidates. The
first quizzes required written an-
swers, but the next tests will be
oral ones, simulating actual contest
conditions.

Testing will resume next Wednes-
day in Newcomb 8, at 7:30 p.m. A
large number of hopefuls is still run-
ning for team berths.

Student Literary Book
Will Be Published Two
Times This School Year

By JOHN KIRKLEY

The student literary maga-
zine, Probes, begun by Tony
Gray last year, was an over-
whelming success; the issue
contained contributions from
all four classes at W&L and

was completely sold out.

Ron Alenstein, a ZBT senior, will
edit the magazine this year. One of
his stories, “Half Sick of Shadows”
appeared in the first issue of Probes
and then won a Mahan award from
the English department.

The purpose of Probes according
to Alenstein: “I have always
thought that there should be a
publication for strictly student
creative writing and I intend for
Probes to fill that need.”

Alenstein plans to bring out two
issues of the magazine this year, one
at the conclusion of each academic
semester. He intends to leave the
price at fifty cents per copy. If stu-
dent support and enthusiasm war-
rant change, he will alter format,
pictures, and type of paper.

All members of the student body
at Washington and Lee are urged
to contribute any poems, short
stories or critical essays, as well as
original art work, to Alenstein at
Box $7, Lexington. December 1 has
been set as a tentative closing date
for acceptance of articles for in-
clusion in the first semester issue.

Alenstein wants to interview
students interested in becoming
the business manager of Probes.
The position is a paying one, In-
terested parties should call him
before October 21 at HO 3-5188.

 

Forensic Union

In UN Debate

By BILL GRAVES

“Should the United Nations
abolished?”

Addressing an audience of 18, Bill
Noell immediately qualified this rath-
er shocking proposal in arguing the
affirmative by suggesting improvement
in certain areas rather than total abol-
ishment. In a well organized but
somewhat general speech, Noell
touched on the Hungarian revolt,
Communist aggression in Laos, the
Cuban situation, and other well
known examples of U.N. failure. He
went on to cite possible future prob-
lems such as recognition of Red China
and the proposed three-man Serce-
tary General in which Russia would
have a seat, and, of course, a veto.
Has the U.N. become little more than.
an “international P.T.A.?”

On the negative side, Dick Kelley
maintained that the U.N. was not a
great international power and that its
real influence lay in the “subtle pres-
sures” that it could diplomatically ex-
ert. He called the U.N. a buffer be-
tween total war on the one hand and
organized limited war on the other.
Another advantage, he said, was that
Russia and consequently Communism
could be held up to world censure.

Following the initial speeches, there
was a question and discussion period
in which the audience was invited to
participate. A vote was taken before
and after the meeting. Before the
speeches, six voted for abolition; after
the debate there were ten votes for
abolition and seven against.

To Petition Faculty

EC Discusses Cold [EC Seeks Student Disciplinary
Committee To Consider Offenses

The Executive Committee will petition the Faculty Admin-
istrative Committee soon to create a student committee to which
some cases of student misconduct will be referred.

The request grows out of a decision reached at the recent

 

Checks, Fraternity
Plans During Meet

At its meeting Monday
night, the Executive Commit-
tee approved a petition to send
to the faculty Administrative
Committee requesting the cre-

ation of a student committee
to handle some student disciplinary
cases. (See the lead story on this
page.)

In other action, the EC talked
over the work of the Cold Check
Committee with Ned Hobbs, the
chairman; approved a memorandum
from Joe Goldstein, chairman of the
Library Committee, concerning his
committee’s activities; and formed
a committee of two to work with
Interfraternity Council President
Bob Doengnes or proposed improve-
ments in the fraternity system.

EC Secretary Steve Suttle was
appointed to head a subcommittee
to consider all proposed constitu-
tional changes. Suttle must gather
all these proposals, holding hear-
ings if necessary, by October 31.

After the October 31 deadline,
Suttle will then present the pro-
posals to the full committee for
consideration.

Hobbs said that the Cold Check
Committee will meet bi-weekly this
year in an attmept “to improve our
relationship with the merchants of
Lexington by cutting down on the
number of bad checks presented and
by helping the merchants to collect
the checks.”

To Collect Checks

He has drafted a form letter to
the merchants concerning the com-
mittee’s work, and set up a system
by which committee members will
make regular calls at all stores fre-
quented by students to see if any
bad checks have been passed.

The Cold Check Committee will
levy heavier fines this year and
will send the names of all second-
time offenders to the EC.

The EC approved Goldstein’s pro-
posal for heavier library fines but
rejected a request by the Library
Committee chairman that excessive
noise be removed from the list of
library offenses.

The EC pointed out that, while it
was difficult to enforce the noise
rule, the Library Committee should
still take the responsibility for the
amount of noise in the library.

Book Thefts?

The EC further instructed Gold-
stein to look into the report that
there were some 60 books found in
fraternity houses this summer which
had not been checked out of the li-
library. If this proved that there
was deliberate unauthorized remov-
al of books going on, the EC plan-
ned to take appropriate measures.

Executive Committeemen Buck
Ogilvie and Bill Roberts were ap-
pointed to work closely with IFC
President Doenges and to offer him
any assistance or advice they could
in the IFC’s supervision of fraternity
affairs.

Geology Prof
Heads Project

This past summer, Dr. Spencer,
head of the geology department at
Washington and Lee, was in charge
of a research expedition to the
Rocky Mountains in Montana. Dr.
Spencer took with him three W&L
geology majors—Richbourgh MeWil-
liams, Rick Belser, and Allen Ker-
win, The work that they were doing
is the last phase of a long term re-
search project sponsored by the Na-
tional Science Foundation.

The group was headquartered in
Bowman, Montana for two months.
Their objective was to collect data
on the rocks in a fifty by twenty
mile area of rugged terrain. This
land is classified as a “primitive”
area by the government; no im-
provements, such as roads or houses,
may be built on it. Dr. Spencer said
that some mountains in this section
reach a height of 11,000 feet and that
there are many wild animals, such
as bears, wolves, moose, elk, and
deer in the area.

The data that was collected in the
field during the summer is now be-
ing analyzed. The purpose in the
summer expeditions is to prove the
past existence of a mountain range

| in this region, Evidence gathered so

far indicates that a range did exist
in this location approximately one
and a half billion years ago and

was completely eroded down. The
present day Rockies are only seven-
ty million years old.

Dr.. S. J. Kazok, another member |
of the geology department and new |
to Washington and Lee, spent the

(Continued on page 4)

kleaders decided that they would try
to set up some system by which
misconduct by students from other
schools which took place on their
campuses would be referred to a
student committee at the offending
student’s school.

The student government leaders
felt this would be a good first step
toward giving their respective stu-
dent bodies a larger role in the ad-
ministration of student conduct.

In the petition that the EC will
present to the Committee, they point
out “the student body is not now
ready or willing to assume total re-
sponsibility in this area.”

However ,student body president
Andrew McThenia said “we feel that
creation of this committee will be
a valuable first step in developing
a sense of responsibility in the stu-
dent body.”

“This memorandum,” the EC says,
“is no sense a criticism of the pres-
ent faculty administrative commit-
tee. It is believed that this body
has been eminently fair in the de-
termination of all cases before it.

“However, many students who ap-
pear before the Administrative Com-
mittee do so only after a series of in-
cidents have occurred. The impact
of these offenses when compounded
is serious. If such incidents were
dealt with as they occurred perhaps
further incidents could be avoided.”

“A responsible student group
working with faculty guidance and
supervision could exert a_ strong
influence on the other students in
this area. The group could advise
a student guilty of misconduct that
such actions were unacceptable to
his own student generation.

“If it was the opinion of the group
that the case was sufficiently serious
to merit disciplinary action, then it
would be referred to the Faculty
Administrative Committee.”

The proposed student disciplinary
committee would consist o fthe pres-
idents of each academic and law
class, a representative elected from
the freshman class, and one member
of the administration.

The EC stated that discipline “is
not a proper area for its jurisdiction.
Because of the cherished authority
which the EC exercises in the en-
forcement of the Honor System, we
feel that additional authority in the
realm of misconduct would tend to
confuse the functions of the Com-
mittee.”

The petition which the EC will
present to the Administrative Com-
mittee was prepared by McThenia
and Executive Committeemen Meade
Christian and Tim Ireland. The whole
EC approved their memorandum
with only slight changes.

Student Discipline Committee

The Executive Committee took this week what we hope
will be the first step toward placing a larger measure of respon-
sibility for student discipline in the hands of students them-
selves. The EC is requesting that the faculty administrative
committee refer all reports of student misconduct which are
sent here from schools in this area to a committee consisting
of the seven class presidents and one faculty member.

This is a modest first step, to be sure. But it should show
whether student-administration discipline will work or not.

Most of the student body agrees that punishment should
be sternly administered for flagrant offenses such as destruc-
tion of property. However, there are some social rules here
with which a majority of the student body disagree. It would
prove a touchy situation if such rules had to be administered by
a student committee. The proposed disciplinary committee will
help show up areas where student standards of conduct differ
greatly with those of the faculty.

There is a great deal of student misconduct and irresponsi-
bility which now goes unreproved and unpunished. One of
the main reasons these offenses are never brought to light is
the feeling on the part of those who are in a position to report
them that the discipline as administered by the faculty com-
mittee in the past few years has been inconsistent and, often,
overly harsh. If there were some “lower court” with a more
benevolent reputation, many of these relatively minor offenses
could be prevented by making clear to everyone who goes
astray the whys and wherefores of the rules.

Nothing poisons the relationship between student body and
administration faster than an attempt on the part of the ad-
ministration to enforce rules which will inevitably be broken.
If any administration ever does this, evasion on the part of the
students tends to spread to the whole system of conduct they
are expected to follow.

If some sort of student disciplinary committee were set up,
it could probably prevent this sort of mutual disregard from
cropping up. In short, the lines of communication between
students and administration must be kept open.

We sincerely hope the faculty will approve the EC’s re-
quest for this disciplinary committee.

Virginia’s Mock Election

You may not know it, but there is a campaign going
on for governor of Virginia. Not much of a one, though.

The campaign comes to Lexington Monday in the person of
H. Clyde Pearson, the Republican candidate for governor. If
you are devoted to the seventh page of the Richmond Times-
Dispatch, you may have heard of Mr. Pearson. Otherwise, you
probably haven’t. Mr. Pearson is treated by the Virginia news-
papers with slightly less interest than they accord the Mock
Convention.

But every voter in the November election—and there won’t
be many of them—will have to choose between Mr. Pearson
and Albertis Harrison, the Democratic candidate.

Mr. Harrison, who will almost certainly prove to be an
outstanding governor, won the primary over A. E. S. Stephens
by posting large advertisements in every newspaper in Virginia

pointing out that Mr. Stevens had been endorsed by the
NAACP and the AFL-CIO.

So much for Virginia politics. We’re interested in what Mr.
Pearson would like to do about the situation. We haven’t been
able to find out, but we’ll try Monday.

Praise For ‘Probes’

We are glad to hear that Probes will appear again this year.
We hope that editor Ron Alenstein will find enough students
with the urge to write to justify two issues a year.

It is well that Probes is being tried out now in its present
modest format. But if it proves as successful and well-done a
venture as it was last year, it will certainly deserve the same sup-
port given all student publications—by being made a part of
the student activities fee.

Meanwhile we wish Mr.

Probes.

Crime and Punishment In Lexington

By STEVE HENRY
(This column is dedicated to
those unfortunate souls in the stu-
dent body who have felt the wrath
of the ancient and honorable Lex-
ington Police Department.)

If you, dear reader, think for one
small second that the Lexington po-
lice department spends its time do-
ing nothing more important than
giving tickets, helping little kiddies
across the street, and playing tough
guy during student riots, then you
are irretrievably wrong.

Let us take this opportunity to
set you straight.

In reality, the Lexington constabu-
lary is an alert, high-minded, ex-
ceptionally intelligent group of po-
lice officers, dedicated to keeping the
peace and protecting the common
rights of every citizen of this fine
community.

Do not gasp in amazement. Before
this column is over you will see
what profound truth the above state-
ment holds.

Take, for example, the masterful
way that the nifty little LPD han-
dled the Carlos Marcello incident in
1959.

Marcello, as everyone knows, is
one of that rapidly dying, truly
American breed — the hoodlum
gangster. Or so Bobby Kennedy and
the U.S. Senate would like to have
you think.

Cool Carlos, for lack of anything
better to call him, is a big-time
racketeer—a man who never over-
looks an opportunity for making an
honest dollar.

In September, 1959, Marcello and
three of his underworld cronies
rolled down Route 11 into the heart
of Lexington, a sinster plot in mind.

What he had planned was a series
of sweeping changes in the local
government of the small hamlet,
which would eventually enable him
to turn Lexington into the “sin city
of the Shenandoah Valley.”

In Marcello’s mind, there was no
doubt that his plan would work to
perfection.

He would, in rapid order, accom-
plish the following revisions:

1. Take over the local government,
opening the doors to graft and cor-
ruption.

 

2. Take over the pinball machine
racket.

3. Take over the text-book selling
racket.

4. Open a string of plush night
clubs.

5. Open a string of houses of ill-
repute.

6. Sell protection to the local
bourgeoise merchants.

In short, Carlos was a cinch for
man-of-the-year- honors in Lexing-
ton.

Alas, poor Carlos. He did not
figure on the Lexington Police De-
partment. He underestimated the in-
tegrity, the drive, the fierce de-
votion of this organization, just as
others had done before him.

Marcello had planned to buy off
the local law enforcement, just as he
had successfully done in New Or-
leans.

On September 13, he approached
the Mayor of Lexington, while the
good man was on duty, throwing
cards at a hat in the middle of his
spacious office.

“Mayor,” said Carlos. “I have a
great plan for you and me. It’ll net
you a cool million.”

“What do I need a million dol-
lars for?” answered the Mayor. “I
live in Lexington.”

Astounded by this reply, Marcello
laid his plan on the line, hoping to
sway the morals of this servant of
the people.

‘Tll even replace those horrid
brown police uniforms,” said Carlos.

“That, sir, is an insult. Leave this
room at once,” yelled the Mayor.

Carlos was naturally crushed. He
could not believe that any human
would turn down a million dollars
for nothing.

He was soon to be even more dis-
illusioned.

For it was at this crucial point that
Elmer Fudd and his Unbearables
stepped into the scene.

The Unbearables, composed of all
the members of the Lexington Po-
lice Department, had often encount-
ered big time crime, and knew how
to handle smart operators like Mar-
cello.

There had even been talk of mak-
ing a television series about the
group, but producers decided that
there was already too much situa-
tion comedy television.

 

With a series of lightning fast,
brilliantly calculated strokes, the
Unbearables moved to stop Marcello
and his mob.

On September 13, Marcello was
given a ticket for parking in front
of the College Inn. He was to appear
in court on the third of October,
at nine in the morning.

On September 14, he was ticketed
for doing 31 miles per hour in a
30 mph zone.

On September 15, he was ticketed
for making 41 mph in a 40 mph
zone,

On September 16, he was ticketed
for running a red light.

On September 17, he was ticketed
for going north on a south-running
one-way street.

On September 18, Carlos stayed
in his room, too scared to make an
appearance on the streets.

When he finally came down from
his luxurious suite in the Robert E.
Lee, he found a ticket on his car
for parking too far from the curb.
(He was six inches from the curb
instead of the prescribed two inches.)

It was all too much for Carlos.
He hopped in his car, roared off, and
two seconds later was run off the
road by a squad car driven by
Elmer and two of his sneering ma-
chine-gun wielding Unbearables.

“We got you now, Marcello,”
snarled Fudd.

“For what?” asked the somewhat
frustrated Carlos.

“For speeding in a quiet zone,”
laughed Fudd. “That’s a jailable of-
fense around here.”

Marcello could hardly believe that
he was being taken to jail. He had
avoided being jailed in New Orleans,
in Memphis, in New York. And sud-
denly he was being thrown in the
clink of Lexington, Virginia.

From behind bars in the awe-
inspiring edifice known as the Lex-
ington Penitentiary, Carlos called his
slick, big-town lawyer, Sneaky Ra-
gen.

“Come down and spring me,”
shouted Carlos, his temper flaring.

“Where are you, Carlos, old boy,”
queried Sneaky.

“In Lexington, Virginia, charged
with speeding in a quiet zone,” an-
swered Carlos.

“Forget it, Carlos,” said Sneaky.
“No one has beat a rap in Lexing-

 

ton for 150 years. You’re through.”

Carlos found out how right Sneaky
was when his trial took place on
October 3.

His case came up immediately
after the honorable city judge had
disposed of the usual docket, in-
volving 800 Washington and Lee
students.

Carlos watched in awe as all 800
were found guilty as charged and
fined unbelievable sums.

He was trembling for the first time
in his life when he approached the
bench, where sat the good judge.

“Guilty,” said the judge, without
asking for any evidence or state-
ment of the facts in the case. “You
are hereby sentenced to a $500,000
fine for speeding in a quiet zone, or
you are sentenced to living the rest
of your life in Lexington. Take your
choice.”

Marcello, who had based his life
on the Fifth Amendment, was stupi-
fied. At first, he thought that he
should demand a trial, but he knew
that it would be a useless gesture.

“T’ll take the fine,” said, visual-
izing the nightmare of living in Lex-
ington for the rest of his life.

“Make out the check to the town-
ship of Lexington,” smiled the judge,
figuring out on his desk what ten
per cent of $500,000 was.

On the sidelines, Elmer and the
brown-shirted Unbearables smiled,
too, pride and intellect oozing from
every pore.

That night, Carlos and his gang
pulled up stakes in Lexington, their
plans shattered to bits. The “sin
city of the Shenandoah Valley”
would never be a reality.

“Crummy two-bit cops,” snarled
Marcello as he drove away, leaving
forever the township of Lexington.

It was the first time in his life
that he had ever overestimated the
Lexington Police, and by that time,
it was too late.

Friday Historical Staff Recalls Campus Commie Purge

(This article is being run in co-
operation with the Conservative
Society to alert students to the
dangers of Communist infiltration.)

Few students remember the time
when the Communists almost took
over Washington and Lee. But the
story deserves to be retold to a stu-
dent generation blind to the dangers
of international Communism.

Few people realize that there was
a Communist cell on the campus
here in 1902. There was, however.
A determined little cell of reds here

 

in that year, under the leadership
of Fedor Quitepinsky, who had been

Nat’! Science Grant Experiments
By Randall Jones

During the past summer, members of the Washington and
Lee chemistry department continued work on various science
grant experiments and participated in several National Science
Foundation summer lecture programs.

Dr. E. S. Gilreath was in charge of the Inorganic Chemistry

program at Oregon State University*
in Carvallis, Oregon. Dr. Gilreath
delivered an extensive series of lec-
tures to a group of 47 college chem-
istry teachers from all sections of
the country.

Attending Louisiana State Univer-
sity in Baton Rouge, Dr. John H.
Wise participated in the National
Science Foundation program, giv-
ing special attention to isotope ex-
perimentation.

Also participating in the N.SF.
program was Dr. Wm. J. Watt who
conducted a seminar for high school
teachers at the Alabama College in
Montevallo, Ala. Continuing work
on a previously begun experiment,
Dr. James K. Shillington plans to
proceed with students George Foz-
zard and Henry Hawthorne.

Remaining on campus for experi-
men tation through a grant from
the Research Corporation of New
York was Dr. Robert D. Whitaker
and a 1961 graduate, John Ambrose.
For the past two years, the team has
been studying the chemical reac-
tions of certain inter-haloger com-
pounds and amines, nitrogen com-
pounds. The first summer was spent
in the preparation and study of the
new compounds thus allowing this
summer’s work to be more special-
ized.

 

 

The constituent inter-halogen
compounds are ICI and ICI3, the
latter of which little was known.
When the aforementioned were com-
bined with amines, the resultants
were in ratio of 1 to 1 molecular
addition. In a simplified explanation,
molecular addition occurs when two
neutral compounds are combined,
thus adding to the characteristics of
each without changing the original
compounds.

The past summer’s work enabled
Dr. Whitaker and Ambrose to
successfully combine two units of
ICI3 with two amines, a task never
before completed. Presently the
value of this experiment is purely
academic, but the structure, com-
position and general properties of
these compounds have been clearly
elucidated.

Further work on this project will
be undertaken by Jeff Lasher, a
Robert E. Lee science grant reci-
pient. Lasher plans to use the
Hetrodyne Beat apparatus, built last
year by senior Tom Imerson in con-
junction with Dr. E. F. Turner. The
apparatus will accurately determine
the charge separation in compounds.

ICI and ICI3, will be first tested
to determine their charge separation
while later experiments will include
inter-halogen, amine compounds.

 

Campaign to Free the Workers and
Peasants of Rockbridge County
(Bucharest, 1934), was to turn the
Campus Club into a Communist
front. He had chosen the Campus
Club because they edited a dissident
publication called Gripe.

First Quitepinksky enrolled in
W&L as a day student. He then re-
fused to pay his $3.50 rush fee and
was accordingly not bid by any fra-
ternities. The Campus Club rushed to
his defense and offered him a mem-
bership. Quitepinksky accepted just
as he had planned and offered to
contribute to Gripe.

In a_ short time Quitepinksky
was pouring out the Marxist line un-
der the pen name of Ascott III.
Under this mask of anonymity he
was immune from criticism or ex-
posure.

He attacked the $10 application
fee for admission as an imperialist
plot, designed to discourage workers
and peasants from applying to W&L.

He spoke out against the petty
bourgeoisie of the Ring-tum Phi
staff, all of them working under
intolerable conditions in the hope
of one day being able to gain the
massive sum of $200 paid the edi-
tors. He uncovered the fact that
they had no chance whatsoever
since the editorship was firmly con-
trolled by a small elite of capital-
ists.

He argued that the student body
constitution’s guarantees of civil

 

 

liberties were meaningless as long
as the vast proletariat was domi-
nated by a few secret aristocratic
organizations.

Soon Quitepinksky’s articles be-
gan to attract readers to Gripe. He
moved into the next phase of his
plan.

He duped the president of the
Campus Club into running for pres-
ident of the student body on a re-
form platform. The gullible dupe,
Alfred Nephew, was swept into of-
fice in a popular wave of enthusiasm
for liberal ideals.

Meanwhile Quitepinksky had built
up his own system of cells through-
out the University, which he ran
with an iron hand.

But an alert group, the Conserva-
tive Society, began to see the ex-
tent of Communist infiltration here.

They began a series of spectacu-
lar hearings in which the entire
Executive Committee was found to
be a Communist tool. Half the facul-
ty was proven to be in on the plot.

The Board of Trustees, then as
now strongly anti-Communist,
purged the faculty and threw all the
Communists and consymps out of
school.

The school was spared and per-
haps the whole Communist move-
ment in the U.S. was nipped in the
bud.

The sobering story of this plot
was made into a documentary movie,
“Communist Infiltration, 1902.”

Backfield Changes
Will Boost Attack

By ED NORTON

The Washington and Lee Generals,
hoping to preserve the longest win-
ning streak in Virginia football,
resume their 1961 season tomorrow
at Lancastter, Pa., against the Frank-
lin and Marshall Diplomats.

The Generals, 7-6 victors over
Hampden-Sydney in their season
opener two weeks ago, will be
shooting for their second win this
fall.

Changes

Head Coach Lee McLaughlin will
send his charges into tomorrow’s
game with two new additions in the
starting backfield.

Charlie Gummey and Tommy
Keesee have moved up from the
second unit to the first squad, re-
placing Jim Hickey and Doug Mar-
tin.

Gummey, a 195-pound halfback,
and Keesee, 185-pounder, will add
power running to the W&L back-
field, which has been hurt, accord-
ing to McLaughlin, by a lack of
“punishing runners.”

Hickey, at 165 pounds, and Martin,
at 155, are both primarily breaka-
way runners, who are at their best
moving away from the line instead
of into it.

Gummey and Keesee will team
with quarterback Steve Suttle and
right halfback Jim Russ on the
Washington Blue team.

Martin will be used as*a wild
card in the General offense, which
operates with three separate teams,
the blue, red and gold units.

In the line, McLaughlin plans only
one change for the F&M game.

Tougher

McLaughlin called the Diplomats
“much tougher than last year,”
when the Generals ran up an easy
38-6 victory.

Assistant Coach Boyd Williams,
who scouted the Dips 13-9 loss to
Johns Hopkins last week, said that
F&M has an “experienced and cap-
able line that held the Hopkins
offense in check most of the after-
noon.”

“They got it up front. There’s no
doubt about that,” said Williams.

Williams’ scouting report described
the 1961 Franklin and Marshall
squad as the best the Generals have
faced in their four-year rivalry with
the Pennsylvania school.

The Generals are on the short end
of the record now, having dropped
two out of three decisions to the
Diplomats.

Good Shape

Physically, the Generals should be
in good shape, after an open date
last week.

Both Terry Fohs and Martin, who
were on the questionable list last
week after minor injuries, will be
ready to go.

Baby Generals
Play Ferrum

Junior College

The Washington and Lee Baby
Generals, plauged by injuries, meet
Ferrum Junior College tomorrow
afternoon in their second game of
the season.

In last week’s 12-0 loss to Wood-
berry Forest, halfback Bill Jamison
fractured an ankle and _ fullback
Bruce Kurtz joined co-captain Dan
Manson on the injured list, the
result of a fractured rib.

These injuries have forced Coach
Swan to move 125-lb. quarterback
Gordon Gray to full, and co-captain
Chase to wingback. Rounding out
the backfield will be Doug Davis,
either Bill Lee or Ed (Rocket)
Bradbury, and Bill David.

Ferrum tied the VMI “Rats” 20-
20 last week, and are expected to
be the biggest and possibly best
team the Brigaders will face all
year.

Coach Swan said, “We’re de-
pending on our defense to get us

Coach Mac Is

Cautious; He
Remembers °59

By STEVE HENRY

“We just can’t forget what hap-
pened the last time we went to
Lancaster.”

Washington and Lee head coach
Lee McLaughlin was talking about
tomorrow’s game with the Frank-
lin and Marshall Diplomats.

The “last time” that McLaughlin
referred to was 1959, when the Gen-
erals, after two straight lop-sided
victories, traveled to Lancaster to
meet the supposedly weak Dips,
only to come out on the short end
of a 28-14 score.

“We got cocky in ’59,” said Mc-
Laughlin. “They just bombed us off
the field.”

McLaughlin, however is not pes-
simistic, only cautious, about tomor-
row’s contact.

With his multi-Star Generals in
good physical shape, McLaughlin’s
charges will enter the F&M game
heavy favorites.

McLaughlin himself admits that
he’s got the material to duplicate
last year’s 38-6 win over the Diplo-
mats.

“They’re tougher this year,
though,” he warns. “They played
Hopkins to a standstill last week,
and Hopkins is plenty tough.”

“But we've got the talent if we just
use it, especially on offense,” he
added.

In the Hampden-Sydney game two
weeks ago, won by the Generals
7-6, McLaughlin’s multi-teamed of-
fense suffered, due mainly to a lack
of adequate downfield blocking.

Only a third quarter sustained
touchdown drive salvaged the Gen-
erals’ undefeated string.

Since then, McLaughlin has sent
his linemen through repeated prac-
tice sessions on blocking, stressing
downfield contact.

“The backs can go if we get the
blocking,” said McLaughlin.

“Our biggest problem this week
is mental. We’ve got to be up or
it could be ’59 all over again.”

 

Notice

Will Lee, social chairman of Open-
ings Dances, announced today that
Joe Tex and the Dukes of Rhythm
will play at the Moose Lodge on
Sunday, October 15, from two until
six.

Booters Gain
First Victory,

2-1 Over R-M

By BOB BROWN

Freshman wing Gil Slingerland
come up with a late game goal
Wednesday that handed the Wash-
ington and Lee soccer team a 2-1
decision over Randolph-Macon Col-
lege.

The win evened the Generals’ sea-
son record at 1-1.

Head coach Joe Lyles singled out
Slingerland, Steve Hibbard, and
Bruce Jackson for their play. Hib-
bard and Jackson were substituting
for first-stringers Tom Clements and
Dunlop Ecker, who were out of ac-
tion due to injuries.

He also praised Bill Outman and
Bob Pagano for their offensive show-
ings, which repeatedly put the Gen-
erals in scoring position against Ma-
con,

In all, the Generals pushed some
22 scoring attempts past the Yellow
Jacket defense.

Lyles, however, is concerned with
apparent weaknesses in passing.

The booters meet Carson-Newman
on October 6 in the season’s third
game.

week, designed to help fraternity
I-M managers get organized, which
is presently quite hard to do because
of a general lack of information
on I-M schedules.

The editorial staff of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi feels, however, that
this proposed coverage of intramur-
als will be totally impossible without
the complete cooperation of the fra-
ternities.

It will be necessary for each
house to appoint or assign someone
to give the information to the intra-
mural editor when he calls the
house, probably on Wednesday
night, to get I-M information.

If this information is too spotty
or nil, then it naturally follows that
the idea of “Intramural Round-Up”
will fold with great rapidity.

We respectfully request your help
in making this venture at least a
moderate success.

 

Notice

Try-outs for the Washington and
Lee golf team are currently under-
way at the Lexington Country Club
here, according to golf coach Cy
Twombly.

Anyone who wants to go out for
the team and who has not contacted
Coach Twombly should see him
before next Thursday, when further
qualification trials will be held.

Approximately 20 boys are trying
out for the 10 places on the squad.
Six lettermen return from last year.

Student Library Committee Sets New Fines

The following standard minimum fines for specific
library offenses were adopted at a meeting of the Stu-
dent Library Committee on September 27, 1961, and
were submitted to the Executive Committee of the Stu-

dent Body for approval:

NOTE: The purpose of this rule is to make a definite
and well defined means of distinguishment between
regular reserve books and locked reserve books.

At the present time, a locked reserve book that is
checked out from the Library can conceiveably be kept
out for an indefinite period of time, provided the
student is willing to pay a fine of 10 cents per hour.

This is the same rule that applies to a regular re-
serve book at the present time. Thus, in actuality,

new rule he would not be charged 10 cents per hour
fine; instead, he would appear before the Student
Library Committee.

In this day, the deplorable situation of having only

three books to serve 50 students should be alleviated

to some extent.

there is no difference between a locked reserve book

and regular reserve book with the exception of the
fact that the former are kept behind the librarian’s

desk.

Thus, by adding the above rule to library regula-
tions, the Student Library Committee hopes to make
locked reserve a meaningful and effective part of our

Library operation.

Should a student be guilty of not returning a
locked reserve book at the designated time, under this

4. Mutilation

In the event that this regulation is approved, a
notice to this effect will be given to all professors us-
ing locked reserve in order that they can inform their
classes with regard to this matter.

2. Unauthorized removal of a reserve book and
any 14-day book (removing a book from the library
without properly checking it out) is subject to a
minimum fine of $10.00.

3. The intentional hiding of any book or periodical
is subject to a minimum fine of $20.00.

of a book or periodical involving

underscores or similar offenses will be subject to a
minimum fine of $2.00.

5.Wilful destruction of any library book or perioid-

ical will be subject to a fine of $50.00. Deliberate des-

truction includes intentionally tearing out pages and
riping up the book.

Discuss Elections
At AP Meeting

By ANDY NEA
Managing Editor

Gubernatorial candidate Albertis Harrison, Jr., and his
Republican opponent H. Clyde Pearson, appeared in Lexing-
ton yesterday before the meeting of the Virginia Association
of Press Broadcasters. Both the Democratic and Republican
candidates for governor pledged to keep the citizens of the state
better informed of governmental activities if elected.

At a luncheon appearance, Albertis*

Harrison told the broadcasters that
he would like to have at least two
regularly scheduled news confer-
ences in Richmond each week. In
addition, he would make _ himself
available to the newspaper, radio
and TV representatives while travel-
ing through the state.

Harrison condemned classifying
of information by governmental
agencies which try to avoid pub-
lic embarrassment. He stated that
he believed that much of the now
classified information has little or
no direct relation to national se-
curity.

Harrison called upon the radio
and TV broadcasters to exploit their
powers for influencing public opinion
through editorializing as well as the
presentation of factual news.

The former attorney general stat-
ed that he felt that the handling of
the state’s segregational problems
by the press was excellent. This
was largely due to the co-operation
of a well informed and free press.

Jefferson Man

The Democratic candidate for gov-
ernor told broadcasters that he was
in full accord with the dictum of
Thomas Jefferson that if the choice
were either government or free
press, he would choose the latter.

He added that he felt sure if
Jefferson were saying this today,
he would include the free broad-
casting industry.

The Democratic nominee’s talk to
a luncheon meeting followed the
opening session of the VAPB at
Washington and Lee.

The Republican candidate for gov-
ernor addressed the same group of
broadcasters at an evening dinner
meeting.

Attacks Government

In his speech, Pearson criticized
what he termed as Virginia’s “shad-
ow government.” He accused it of
withholding information from the
public.

He accused the Democratic ad-
ministration of defranchising large
segments of the people, usurping

local rights, causing industrial
stagnation, and closing public
schools.

The main charge that Pearson
leveled at the Democrats was direct-
ed toward the General Assembly. He
struck out sharply at their use of
executive sessions whereby the pub-
lic had no immediate knowledge of
their actions.

“What disturbs me and other Re-
publican members of the General
Assembly is the long-standing tra-
dition of holding executive meetings
of a committee whenever a vote is
about to be taken.” He cited in par-
ticular the committee on Privileges
and Elections.

“It is a sad commentary on Vir-
ginia’s political system that the votes
of this committee, which handles
all matters concerning voting laws,
and contested elections are never
made public.”

Pearson promised if elected to
hold at least one regularly sche-
duled press conference a week
and more if necessary to the pub-
lic interest. He also proposed a
public forum where individual
citizens would be able to question
the governor on matters of policy.

“It is easier for one Governor to
go to the people than for the people
to go to one governor,” he said.

The speeches were a part of a
two-day meeting on the W&L cam-
pus at the VAPB meeting. The
broadcasters were welcomed to the
W&L campus by Dr. O. W. Riegel,
director of the Journalism depart-
ment.

The newsmen participated in var-
ious discusssions and attended var-
ious meetings on the better useage
of the communications media.

Eighty radio and television sta-
tions throughout the state are rep-
resented at the combined fall session
and seminar for radio and television
newsmen. VAPB and Washington
and Lee University are the cospon-
sors of the meeting.

The Conference will close today
with an address by Frederick W.
Ford of the Federal Communications
Commission, Washington, D.C.

Beanie Rules

The Assimilation Committee an-
nounced today that freshmen must
continue wearing their beanies be-
yond the Homecomings weekend.

This decision was made in view
of the large number of violations
regarding the rule, a spokesman said.

The committee said that it was
“unfortunate that the entire class
must be penalized for the poor at-
titude of a few members, but the
substantial volume of violations is
indicative of a noticeably lax at-
titude in the Freshman Class.”

He expressed hope that in the
future there will be better observ-
ance of the freshman traditions of
wearing beanies and speaking first.

 

Committee Approves
Requests For Extra

Christmas Parties

The IFC reported last night that
the Faculty Committee has approved
the request for more house parties
during the two weekends before

    

 

Christmas.

The committee approved a request |
allowing eight fraternities to hold!
house parties the weekend of Dec- |
2, and granted the same privileges |
to an additional eight for the fol-|
lowing weekend.

The remaining two fraternities |
voted to hold no December parties. |

This ruling was granted as a re-
sult of the shortage of available
weekends for Christmas parties.
After the Christmas parties, the
present rule of no more than five
house parties on any “off” weekend |
will be continued.

William C. Pusey, Dean of the}
College, gave a brief talk at the
meeting explaining the Automatic |
Rule and absence regulations. He
urged that all freshmen familiarize
themselves with the rules and re-|
spect them.

In other business, Steve Rutledge,
Phi Gam President, was appointed
head of a new committee establish-
ed to study possible improvements
in Help Week.

It was also announced that the
alumni will offer four prizes this
year for Homecoming decorations.
All decorations must be completed

EMPHASIS

The Academic Improvement Of Washington and Lee

EDITOR’S NOTE: Today marks the first appearance of what we
feel is an innovation and a new idea in news reporting for this news-
paper. Emphasis, which will appear weekly, will deal with subjects of
importance to this student body. Today’s subject is “The Academic
Improvement of Washington and Lee, 1957-1962.”

By BILL BOWEN
Associate Editor

Since for obvious reasons it would be impossible here to trace the
academic rise of this University since it was founded in 1749, we shall
concern ourselves with the last half of the decade, 1957 to 1962.

Before I progress any further let me state that W&L has, is, and will
continue to improve its academic standards and facilities. However, this
improvement is not soley an intrinsic one, but rather one that travels in
direct proportion to the caliber of student who applies here for admission.

Caliber of Student Has Improved

Every year since 1957 the caliber of the student entering W&L as a
freshman has steadily improved. That is to say, that the average student
entering the University this fall came better equipped academically than
his predecessor of five years ago.

Proof of this can readily be seen in steps that the English department
has taken. Five years ago this department taught a remedial English
course to boys who they felt were not quite ready for English 1. This course
dealt heavily in grammar, spelling, and in general, things that should have
been mastered in high school. Today it is no longer necessary to teach
this course.

.

   
 

 

Courses for Advanced Freshmen

In the past years the English department also had a second semester
course for advanced freshmen that allowed them to skip English 2 and
progress to the sophomore level.

Today they have been able to step this up so that exceptional students
can start this advanced course the first semester and completely skip
English 1 and 2. Further testimony to this overall improvement can be seen
in the fact that they have had to create an additional section of this ad-
vanced course to handle all of the students who qualify for it.

The math department has done very nearly the same thing in its field.

previously taught to freshmen, to a program of calculus. Here again they
have only been able to do this because of the rise in ability of the incoming
student.

On the other hand the Commerce school adopted a complete revision |
of curriculum in 1956-57 which, although it does not directly attest to the |
fact that its students are improving in caliber, certainly shows a major |
step forward in liberalizing of the department.

 

What the “C” school did was to increase the elective hours a commerce
major had from 12 to a possible 49.

Of course in terms of student improvement, this change could suggest |
that the Commerce School feels that its students today are better equipped |
to pick their courses for themselves. |

New Buildings Mark Improvement
The construction of the new science building marks another step for-
ward in the improvement of the University. This building will provide |

football, was co-captain of the var-
sity wrestling team, lettered in var-
sity track, was a member of the de-
bate team, was elected to the Liter-
ary Society, and joined both the
math and glee clubs. He was also an
editor of the school newspaper. At
the time of his departure, Ken was
first in his class scholastically.

In the last half of the eleventh
grade, Boiarsky attented Atherton
High School where he edited the lit-
erary magazine and ran _ varsity
track.

Transferring to Wagner High
School in his twelfth year, Ken was
elected editor-in-chief of the lit-
erary magazine and again ran var-
sity track.

Continuing his interest in extra-
curricular activities at W&L, Boiar-
sky is a reporter for the Ring-tum
Phi. He also plans to wrestle and
run track when the season starts.

Boiarsky’s Statement

Upon notification of his selection
as candidate, Boiarsky stated: “I
am very grateful for the opportuni-
ty presented me, and should I be-
come Freshman Executive Commit-
teeman, I will, to the best of my
ability, carry out the responsibilities
and duties of this office.”

Party Chairman Grantham Couch
stated that “with the selection of
Ken Boiarsky, the University Party
continues its policy of selecting can-
didates of proven experience and
ability.”

Baker Is Independent’s Choice

Bob Baker, the Independent Par-
ty candidate for the office, attended
Madison High School, Madison, N. .J,
where he was active in student
government, athletics, and publica-
tions.

Bob was president of the stu-
dent body his senior year and was a
member of the student council his
freshman, sophomore, and_ senior
years.

Student Government Activities

When he was a junior he served
as a member of his class council,
and in addition was president and
secretary of the Suburban Confer-
ence of Student Councils, made up
of six high schools in the Madison
area,

In athletics, Baker lettered in
football which he played for three
years, lettered in track which he
ran for four years, and was a mem-
ber of the school gymnastics team.

In addition to these activities
Bob was an Honor Roll student for
three years ,a member of the edi-
torial board of the yearbook, and
was an active participant in the
Foreign Exchange Student program
conducted by the American Field
Service.

At W&L Baker’s activities already
include the business staff of the
Ring-tum Phi, a staff member of

| the Calyx, and a participant in the

UCA boys’ club work.
Baker’s Statement

When told he was a candidate for
the EC, Baker said, “I am very
honored by the Independent Party’s
confidence in me; and if elected by
the freshman class, I will make every
effort to honor the trust they have
shown me.”

Spud Slater, party chairman, com-
mented that “the selection of the
party tonight reflects once more
the wise and sound judgment of
the party in their selection of can-
didates.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

By TOM LYBASS
Associate Editor

(Editor’s Note: This article is
the first in a series about Wash-
ington and Lee’s role in the Civil
War).

Bitter political excitement in-
volving the sectional wrangling
over slavery and the constitution-
tional rights of the South was
raging throughout the United
States in the 1850’s. Among the
many people who felt the impact
of these events were the students
of Washington College.

Until 1860 Washington College
continued to follow in its academic

and social routine quietly. Like
the W&L man of today, the stu-
dent of Washington College of the
1850’s studied hard most of the
time with only ocacsional breaks
to enjoy the social life of a fra-
ternity and to take part in extra-
curricular activities.

The curriculum of Washington
College was rigid. Similar to that
of the other institutions of the
time, it consisted of ancient and
modern languages, mathematics,
philosophy, chemistry, elocution,
and composition.

Cold Check Committee’s Action

Is Encouraging And Is Hailed:
—Keep It Up—

It is encouraging to see the Executive Committee taking
positive action with the heretofore almost non-existent Cold

Check Committee.

Cold Check Chairman Ned Hobbs is to be commended on

his proposals and on his work. His announcement that the com-

mittee will meet bi-weekly this year in an attempt to

“improve

our relationship with the merchants of Lexington by cutting

down on the number of ‘bad checks”

in Our opinion is a state-

ment that the previous Cold Check Committees have avoided

far too long.

This committee became almost

“non-existent” last year

and during years gone by. The Merchants’ Association of
Lexington, having lost faith in W&L’s organization, last year
was forced to pass a rule stating that a one dollar fine would
be impounded on all bad checks. Isn’t it a discouraging
factor to see that Washington and Lee government was not
able to handle its own problems? Isn’t it even more discour-
aging to realize that the local merchants had to ban together
to force action out of this committee?

The Executive Committee at last has recognized this prob-
lem. Their strengthening of the Cold Check Committee’s fines,
and Hobbs’ statement that he will enforce the rule which states
that all second-time offenders will be reported to the E.C., we
feel are both indicative of the ‘‘new look” in Washington and

Lee’s student government.

The Cold Check Committee has been a “‘nothing’’ organi-

zation for too long.

It is encouraging to see that this will no longer be the case
and that a definite program has been initiated and put into op-
eration. It is our sincere hope that this program will continue
to flourish and that the Committee members will do the job that
is necessary during this critical year of student government at

Washington and Lee.

Undefeatable Again?

Washington and Lee’s 40-0 victory over Franklin and Mar-
shall in Saturday’s game is indeed a living tribute to a great

team and to a great man.

A team which is composed of players who receive no
compensation of any kind, the W&L squad deserves a great
deal of praise and much cheering.

Going undefeated last season, the Generals showed the
sports world that to win you don’t have to be subsidized; you
only have to have a sincere determination to win.

We feel that last year’s undefeated season not only repre-
sented a true determination for victory, but that this record
also spoke for the efforts of one man—Coach Lee McLaughlin.

“Coach Mac”’

deserves our praise, and he deserves the

praise of the student body. He built one team—an unbeatable

team.

We can forsee that another fine record is ahead, and that
another undefeatable team is in the making.

All-Out War Would End Cycle

By DAVE KNIGHT

In the beginning, man pitted his
strength against the forces of na-
ture in the struggle for survival.
In the end, if man survives the ef-
fects of an all-out nuclear war, he
shall once again match wits with
these external powers. Thus the
cycle of civilization is complete.

A cursory reading of the afore-
said concept would tend to leave
the reader in a state of skepticism.

ternities, which are no longer ex-
istent, offered the students such
simple social entertainments as
corn husking contests, log-rolling
contests, shooting matches, and
hunting with hounds.

The extra-curricular activities of
Washington College men were
centered mostly on two flourish-
ing literary societies, the Wash-

*

Graham Literary Society. The pro-
gram of each meeting of these
literary societies consisted of dis-
cussion of some subject of inter-
est to the members. Some of the
subjects debated at this time were:

“Is seduction a greater moral
crime than murder?”;

“Is slavery in accordance with
the dictates of humanity?”;

“Ought the Nebraska Bill to
pass?”

There were never more than
seventy students enrolled in Wash-
ington College during this time.
The majority of the students were
from Rockbridge County. Very
few Washington College men were
non-Virginians. The faculty con-
sisted of six men, one of whom was
the president of the college.

The election of Abraham Lin-
coln in 1860 saw the end of the
quiet, meditative life of the Wash-
ington College student. Students
began to express war sentiments
regarding secession and even
started to take issue with the
people of Lexington, whose strong
attachment to the Union had led
them to vote for John Bell of the
Union Party in the 1860 election.

The people of Rockbridge Coun-
ty did not lose hope in Unionism

Last week I promised to write
some really wicked things about the
dens of vice that
neighboring insti-
tutions are
spawning in ap-
palling numbers
in the forms of
smokers. A week’s
thought, however,
has changed my
mind. “There is
enough reform
going on,” I said
to myself. “Too
much will leave
the next generation with nothing to
fight.”

So what I know about the sin and
depravity that lurks behind smoker
doors will not be revealed at this
time. I never have been one to de-
prive the world’s unborn of a play-
thing. Thus my legacy will be—an
unreformed institution, the college
smoker.

This altruistic move on my part
forces me into less fertile pastures,
for now I must return to our tra-
ditional campus in search of subject.
The subjects abound—but alas, the
time is not right.

I thought first of writing on “Ques-
tions the College Bowl Missed,”

Secondly, if we do withstand this
blow, we shall not retain enough
former knowledge to rebuild our

surge beyond the present day-

It is the belief of many intelli-
gent and well-informed persons
that we should assume the worst.
This implies that if we are pre-
pared to receive a nuclear attack,
although it might not ever occur,
we can possibly prevent total ex-
termination.

This point leads me to a compar-
ison between our means of sur-
vival and the lives of our earliest
forebears. As governments, pri-
vate industries and families find
security and salvation in bomb-
shelters, so did primitive man
depend upon caves and under-
ground dwellings for protection.
We have reverted to a pattern of
life from which our  ancesters
slowly evolved. The enormous

I have decided to wait until our
group of varsity scholars is seen
from coast-to-coast.

Then, I thought it might be fun
to think up some questions for
John Paul’s proposed leadership

so all the Big Clique has to do is

funding the proposed poll tax the
EC could send that cash to the IBM,
their stock would go up, and all
students would get double benefits—
the right man in office and increased
dividends.

But these comments seem either a
little premature or a bit stale. About
the only thing I can see that needs
some ripping criticism right now is
the good old Student Library Com-

I'd really like to know how
many people are losing sleep about
having to appear before this left-

don’t return the locked reserve
books by 4:30 a.m. or whatever
time the books are due.

I can just imagine some poor guy
who has gone through all the tor-

these precious volumes (trial by

Instead of being able to put up a

is used by the SLC to build up

fate will be forced to face his peers,
who will browbeat him until he
weakens, then sentence him to dust-
ing books on the fourth level for the
remainder of the semester.

Education
Improves
Liberty

By ROBERT C. KETCHAM

Tuesday Columnist

The new and increasing dangers
of our time have caused many to
refer to this era as the Age of
Anxiety. With heightened fear of
the bomb, of our country’s position
in Berlin and in other parts of the
world where rising expectations are
evidencing themselves, Americans
are caught up in situations which
old fashioned remedies of isolation
or war cannot correct.

With an increase in tension comes
a resulting increase in fear. The two
big governments caught up in these
present situations, often called
“crises,” because of their confiicting
ideologies capitalize on the greater
fear by an increase in propaganda.
Nor is this propaganda only aimed
at those on the other side or at
those nations not overtly affiliated,
so-called “neutrals.”

The USA’s own President Ken-
nedy often uses propaganda on his
own people to achive his ends.

How was the President able to get
his foreign aid bill through Congress
or that huge amount requested for
increased military expenditures?
And further witness the passing of
the National Defense Act which is
more properly called an education
bill but with its different label en-
countered little difficulty in getting
through Congress.

In fact, much of what we as citi-
zens receive from the government is
propaganda. The government is not
educating the people about its un-
dertakings and the people surely
cannot educate the government.

It would seem that leaders in a
leading democratic country have re-
sorted to tactics used by other na-
tions cut from a different mold. Our
nation was built around the concept
of an informed and educated elec-
torate. To impose on the nation’s
people a propaganda based on fear
is not the proper approach. Such a
method emanating from our gov-
ernment presupposes that Americans
cannot understand the reasons but
must be prodded by fear.

Two ideas suggest themselves at
this point. First, as Americans
we have been told that we should
have a fear of communism rather
than a fear of what causes com-
munism. The second is that many
there are who hate communism
not because it betrayed the revo-
lution but because it is the revo-
lution.

The fear of communism per se
is used as a scapegoat by many per-
sons today for all that is wrong
both in America and in other na-
tions who are in our camp, were in
our camp, or are camping out.

Is it too much nowadays to assume
that Americans cannot understand
the world today with its power
struggle and rising expectations, that
the nation must be rallied to the
menace in the name of pure fear?

Americans have traditionally been
known as individuals who believe
in action and lawful order. They
are a nation born out of revolution.
Our country needs education in the
things that cause communism and
not indoctrination. It wants to un-
derstand what is going on in Ber-
lin and therefore needs a teacher
rather than headline and vacuous-
ness.

Americans know that their
country is the nation which others
use as a yardstick for progress,
that their freedom is admired as
an idea by many persons, even
Hungarians and most recently,
| Syrians. They may know such

Bench strength, which carried W&L to an unbeaten season

vantage of it.

Suttle scored the opening touch-
down as he raced 21 yards after
Gummey had recovered a F&M
fumble.

Late in the second quarter, Gum-
mey ended a fifty yard drive by go-
ing over from the seven. He then
made his second conversion of the |
afternoon giving the Generals a 16- |
0 half-time lead.

Gummey Again

The heat and the platooning of
W&L’s four teams began to take
effect on Franklin and Marshall’s
tough line midway in _ the third
quarter. Gummey scored his 16th
point of the day as he dove across
from the three.

Later in the quarter, senior half-
back Jim Hickey took a Franklin
and Marshall punt and outran every-
one, as he went 84 yards for W&L’s
fourth touchdown.

Lane Scores

Chuck Lane opened the fourth
quarter with another long scoring
jaunt, this one for 74 yards, and
John Pearson scored the final touch-
down on a 37-yard pass from A. J.
Barranco.

Coach Lee McLaughlin again
praised the defensive work of his
three teams. Besides holding F&M
to 57 yards on the ground and a
hundred yards through the air,
W&L intercepted three passes and
recovered three fumbles.

He went on to say that there were
no serious injuries, and that the
Generals should be in top form for
their homecoming game against Ran-
dolph-Macon next Saturday.

“As far as the Macon game is
concerned,” McLaughlin added, “that
depends on the boys’ attitude when
we take the field Saturday.”

The General head mentor said he
was especially pleased with the
showing of his reserves in the F&M
game and indicated he may use more
of his bench strength in future con-
tests.

Sports Star Of The Week

Coaches Pick
Gummey As
Week’s Best

“As fine a football player as I’ve
coached here at W&L”—this was
accolade accorded General halfback
Charlie Gummey after the fleet-
footed junior from Wilmington, Del.,
led the unbeaten Generals to a
40-0 victory over Franklin and Mar-
shall Saturday.

Gummey, seeing only brief action
in the runaway contest, amassed a
total of 16 points to lead the Gener-
al’s spirited offensive attack.

 

He scored on touchdown runs of
seven and three yards, and added
a pair of two-point conversions.

Gummey also completed his only
pass attempt and recovered one F&M
fumble. He finished with a net rush-
ing gain of 34 yards in a relatively
few number of carries.

Gummey doesn’t confine his ath-
letic prowess to the gridiron. He is
one of the mainstays of the W&L
swimming team and a_ standout
midfielder for coach Bob McHenry’s
lacrosse squad—despite having no
no lacrosse experience prior to en-

 

tering Washington and Lee.

Heavier Ferrum Eleven
Tops Baby Generals, 33-0

Ferrum Junior College seemed to
be in a class by itself as they whip-
ped the Freshman football team,
33-0, at Ferrum, Virginia, last Sat-
urday.

Ferrum had nine starters that
weighed over two hundred pounds
and three strong teams that made
it a discouraging afternoon for the
Baby Generals.

Ferrum Dominates

The Freshman controlled the ball
for only 10 plays in the first half,
while Ferrum dominated play and

{scored 21 points.

W&L made its only long drive
of the afternoon when it marched
from its ten to Ferrum’s 20 behind
the running of Skip Chase and the
passing of Sammy Simpson to Billy
Davis.

Ferrum was led by Dick Zulling,
a 225-pound fullback who scored

| twice on runs of 8 and 46 yards, and

| by 190-pound halfback Ken Wil-

bourne who caught two touchdown
passes.

Coach Swan said that although
| they were too much for our small

The Washington and Lee cross-

and Marshall, Saturday, by a score
of 23-31.

Shank Second
The first place went to F&M’s
O’Connor who edged out Mike

Shank of the Generals. Mac Brown-
lee, Rick Rodgers, Norm Young-

fourth, seventh, eighth, and tenth
for Washington and Lee.

The meet was extremely close,
but fifth and sixth place finishes
gave Marshall the necessary mar-
gin for victory.

Next Saturday afternoon the Gen-

Academic Improvement at

(Continued from page 1)

class rooms, library and display facilities, and general facilities, including

an observatory for physics, a vivarium and greenhouse for biology, a

seismology room for geology and an instrumental analysis laboratory for

chemistry.

Aside from its value to the science department the new building will
also be significant to the journalism and communications department.

Once the physics and pre-engineering departments vacate their present
location in Reid Hall, that building will be remodeled and used principally
by the journalism department for classrooms and studios.

Students Doing Honors Work Increases

Another possible measure of improvement on the individual level can
be seen in the number of students who did honors work last year, 42, as

opposed to 25 in 1957.

There has also been an average increase of two a year in the number

of Ph.D.’s on the faculty since 1957.

An Increase in the R. E. Lee Research Fund

Another valuable item in the overall improvement picture, has been
an increase in the Robert E. Lee: Research Fund for undergraduate re-
search activities. .This was initially started to promote faculty research
activities in which promising undergraduates could take part as research

assistants or apprentices.

These, that I have stated, are just a few of the ways and means in
which Washington and Lee is improving by refusing to remain stagnate,
but moving ahead at a pace equal to that of the incoming ability.

With the wide range of ability that W&L admissions men have been
applying, it is obvious that the University can and will move in only one

direction.
That direction is AHEAD.

Last year the Committee raised
enough money to provide a schol-
arship for a freshman in the class
of 1965.

At the present time there are
thirteen members of the Committee.
There is need for five to eight new
members, a spokesman said.

things but at the present time
they do not realize them.

The realization is diffused by the
negative thought or fear. Our society
is confronted by an expanding im-
perialism, which is which is Soviet
Russia, and by an expanding ideol-
ogy, which is Soviet communism.
But just as the Russians must real-
ize that the US is militarily strong
and committed to fight for access
routes to Berlin so must the Amer-
ican realize that the Soviet Ideology
cannot be smashed by atomic bombs
but by a strong ideology and de-
mocracy.

As Americans we must meet the
Soviet Ideology with a better ideol-
ogy. We cannot be true to ourselves
or to freedom by remaining in a
preoccupied state of fear. For under-
neath the preoccupation with Russia
several great and fundamental his-
torical forces are moving which will
put our institutions and our demo-
cratic faith to the test.

To cry out in fear and to feel so
insignificant as an individual to say
that “it does not matter what I do”
misses the question and the solution.

It is easy, granted, to overlook
the basic issues of keeping and
spreading democracy when the
moral leader of our country gives
his people propaganda served up
in fear.

We are a nation changed, for ex-
ample, by the last depression. In
1932 the government started off to
show that our institutions were suf-
ficiently flexible to care for all the
people’s wellfare. But what did we

Education, Not Indoctrination,

Needed For People Of America

get? The demonstration was never
made and we instead have the pres-
sure group state, caring for the
welfare of those organized enough to
put on the pressure.

America is still the hope of man-
kind; and it follows that America’s
hope is in the educational process
where one learns to understand,
evaluate and question.

Example: Is the tariff hurting the
farmers? Then is The Answer to do
what we are doing, that is, retain
the tariff and subsidize the farmer?
Are administered prices hurting la-
bor? Is The Answer in what we are
doing; that is, striving for admin-
istered wages too?

Questions such as the above are
matters. One would be a fool to
be at ease today about those mat-
ters or communism. But Ameri-
cans must not allow themselves to
be overcome by fear and therefore
paralyzed.

One thing is certain, only by eval-
uating and improving the institu-
tional structure in our own country
can we hope for a better democracy
in time.

Pure fear is not the answer. The
solution lies in an education and un-
derstanding of what causes the com-
munist ideology to continue growing
and an espousal of our own strong-

er ideology.

I do not question the ability of
man to transplant the fertile seeds
of experience and learning in a
before and after relationship. I
remain extremely dubious, how-
ever, concerning the tools of na-
ture with which man must rebuild
his empire.

Again, in comparison, a land
decimated by explosions, fire and
radiation is similar to the tangled
wilderness that our forefathers
faced. The utensils, not the ability,
would prevent the revival of an

advanced culture.

If the world is to be devastated

by the thoughts and actions of nu-
clear warfare, then man must be
prepared to start afresh, for this
cycle of civilization is terminated.

Conservative Society To Sponsor
‘Operation Abolition’ Showing

William S. P. Cotter, organization-
al director for Young Americans for

p.m. Tuesday, sponsored by the Con-
servative Society.

The head of the national organiza-
tion of conservative groups on some

Colin Wilson
To Speak Here

A controversial British auth-
or will be the guest speaker
Monday for Washington and
Lee’s 39th Seminar in Litera-
ture.

Colin Wilson will talk about

“The Younger Generation of Writers
in Europe” at an 8:15 p.m. public
addressess in duPont Auditorium. He
will emphasize two European writ-
ers—Kazantzakis and Durenmatt—
and their relation to other contem-
porary authors.

Wilson will remain on the Wash-
ington and Lee campus Tuesday for
individual conferences with stu-
dents.

 

Born in Leicester, England, in 1931, |,

Wilson left school at 16 and worked
as a civil servant and laborer be-
fore settling in Paris to write his
first book, The Outsider (1956).
Called a “diagnosis of the sickness
of modern man,” this work of liter-
criticism analyzed the hero as found
in such writers as Sartre, Camus,
Hemingway, Kierkegaard and Kafka
The book was violently criticized
and as violently defended in the late
1950's.

Other books by Wilson include
Religion and Rebel (1957), The Age
of Defeat (1959) and Ritual in the
Dark (1960).

a public audience in the university’s
duPont Auditorium. His talk will be
followed by the showing of the
film, “Operation Abolition.”

Since it was first released in 1960,
“Operation Abolition,” which is sup-
posed to show how the riots of col-
lege students against the House Un-
American Activities Committee in
San Francisco in 1959 were Com-
munist-led, has been the focus of
a national controversy.

Young Americans for Freedom was
founded last year in New York and
its national membership has grown
to 21,000. The Conservative Society
here was formed last Spring by a
group of Washington and Lee stu-
dents and townspeople. Brent Ar-
thur is president.

If no more than 5 per cent of the student body and 10 per

cent of the alumni get thrown in jail....
If people who hate party weekends will show a little tol-

If the combos all show up tonight...

If the football team gets a training break .. .

If no more than 3 per cent of the student body has to un-

If the Southern Collegian passes the censors...

If the editor passes his French quiz...

We might have a good weekend. Meanwhile, our fingers

Happy Homecoming!

Randolph-Macon coach Joe McCutcheon is a W&L grad-
uate. If you don’t believe it, ask Lee McLaughlin.

“Sure, McCutcheon graduated from W&L. He played on
the 1951 ’Gator Bowl team. As a matter of fact, he was co-cap-
tain, and was on the ’51 All-State team.”’

Well, so what?

“This means that Joe will be ‘coming home’ this weekend.
This is his Homecomings, too. You can bet that his boys will
put on a show. They’ll be up for us.”

So if you can spare the time between the concerts and the

By TIM O'KEEFE

“History is bunk!”

This sentiment, first expressed by
Henry Ford a half-century ago, is
still the attitude of millions of
Americans today, according to W.
Howard Adams, a graduate of the
Washington and Lee Law Schools
and first editor of Shenandoah, who
spoke here Wednesday night.

“We as people have never cared
much about our history,” Adams
said, “and we have our ‘Founding
Fathers’ to thank for this. It seems
to them that the history before the
American Revolution was imperfect
and should be forgotten. An aware-
ness of the past seemed to be a vio-
lation of the democratic spirit, only
so recently established.”

As a result of this anti-history
pattern in early America and
strengthened in the 18 Century, the
cultivation of historical “passion”
was lost he said. Today the virtues
needed for such a historical sense
are all but lost, except in some of
the “bustling circuses” that are be-
ing put on in commemoration of the
Civil War.

History as Entertainment

“And the saga of the Opening
of the West has been reduced to
something less than a passion on
the television westerns,” Adams said.
“History was not meant to serve as
entertainment at Williamsburg or
Disnyland. At times it’s hard to tell
where one of them leaves off and
the other takes up.”

Americans have developed a de-
sire that their life should be free

 

 

 

 

 

from history—they have the desire
' to break from an unsatisfactory past.

Alumnus Adams Says Americans
Are Insensitive To History

Like their forefathers, they believe
that this is the land of beginning
again and that it does not need a
past. This feeling was especially
strong after the Civil War. The gulf
existing between each generation
then started growing larger. Most
of the people of the 18th Century
were either indifferent towards their
period of history, or they hated it.
It turned out that most of them
hated their century.

America: Beauty to Ugliness

“A visitor to America once re-
marked that in fifty years America
had turned from the most beautiful
country in the world to one of the
ugliest because of our constant war
against nature;”’ Adams said, “our
forces were bent on disfiguring our
country. People don’t realize that the
past and nature are inseparable. Our
environment played a major role in
the history of this country. We must
conserve and adapt nature so that
the presence of the past will live
today.”

Adams cited two examples of the
indifference towards historical places.
“The bulldozers were well into the
leveling of the land around Walden
Pond, which was made so famous
by Thoreau, before a loud protest
was raised.

“And today a large sewage plant
is being built in Maryland across
from Mount Vernon. This is the
smell of indecency which only the
federal government could think of,”
Adams said.

ROTC Plans
New Activities

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Washington and Lee’s green-clad
soldiers-to-be are embarking on
what promises to be a busy and
in some respects experimental year.

Shceduled for the last week in
October is a “night compass prob-
lem” for all students in the ROTC
program. This entails detailing nine
or 10 men with a compass and a cer-
tain destination to reach using the
compass.

The night compass program, exe-
cuted by companies, was instituted
last year at W&L.

Also at the end of October the
freshmen will fire .22 calibre rifles,
culminating their initial marksman-
ship training.

In March juniors will fire MI
rifles. This is new to the univer-
sity this year. (The MI rifle is the
rifle which is presently part of every
soldier’s basic equipment.)

For the first time juniors will this
year go through a combat leaders’
course. Four simulated battle situa-
tions will be given to four-man
teams. A different cadet will act as
“leader” in each situation, present-
ing a solution to the combat problem.

Maj. Edward J. Roxbury said a
typical “situation” might be hand-
ling a wounded man with a pris-
oner of war or fixing a broken jeep
axle in a battle environment.

In April, platoon attack problems
will be conducted. An annual affair,
this consists of putting the various
platoons on a mock battlefield under
fire. Men will be equipped with
weapons and blank ammunition for
the attack.

A feature of the ROTC program
to Washington and Lee is set for the
second semester. A course in western
military history for freshmen is be-
ing planned. The ROTC department
has received two Lee Scholarship
grants to produce a text for the
course.

eens Stud Bowl: Story Of Byron’s Brainchild

By STEVE HENRY

Alumni returning for Homecoming
this year will undoubtedly be over-
joyed to hear that Washington and
Lee has been officially invited to
participate in the first showing of
the new CBS television program,
College Stud Bowl.

The Stud Bowl, in case you did
not know already, is the brain child
of a young CBS executive named
George Gordon Byron.

Byron, who claims ancestry to the
late Lord of the same general name,
attended the University of Virginia,
where he was the biggest stud on
campus for all of the six years he
spent in the undergraduate school
there.

When he finally graduated, his
classmates erected a placard in his
honor on a tree near Jefferson’s
home. The placard read, “Here’s
to good old George Gordon Byron,
the stupidest stud in the world.”

That was what bugged Byron. The
part about being stupid.

He got the title during the year
When UVa was asked to appear on
the College Quiz Bowl.

Byron showed up for the initial

try-out session for the Quiz Bowl)

squad, his mind made up that he
would appear on television, snow
the general public with his studli-
ness, and draw numerous small town
idols to the good University.

Unfortunately, Byron blanked the
entire general knowledge quiz. He
scored a remarkable zero out of a
hundred questions, based entirely
on what was going on in the world.

His classmates, who until that time
had admired George for being such a
stud, sensed immediately a small
flaw in their idol.

George’s popularity waned from
day to day after his disastrous
quiz bowl try-out, and the entire
business was culminated by the
plaque put up by his disillusioned
class-mates.

Ever since then, George had har-
bored a distinct distaste for the
College Quiz Bowl program.

Shortly after graduation, George
entered a profession entirely suited
to his intellectual ability. It was
television.

Within a few short months, the
men at the top realized that they
had something rare

 

in George—a |
man who perfectly understood the)
taste of the American television |

viewing public.

All George had to do was to
say that he liked a program, and
immediately the network would put
the show on the air, figuring that
what was bad enough for George to
like was good enough for the coun-
try.

George, who has become well
known at CBS as G. G., moved up
the ladder of success until he final-
ly found himself in program re-
search.

One day he was called into the
office of his employer.

“G.G.” said the boss.
trouble.”

“Why so, chief?” asked George.

“Because of the College Quiz
Bowl. It’s taking away our Sun-
day afternoon viewing audience.
Surely there’s something we can
do.”

“T’ll sleep on it, chief,” answered
George.

On his way home that night, Byron
was thinking about the hated Quiz
Bowl and how it might even cost
him his job if he didn’t come up
with a program to challenge it.

Suddenly, he had it—the idea he
had been looking for.
Why not a College Stud Bowl?

The way he had it figured, there
was no way for the program not
to work. The American public, al-
ways a stud-minded group, would
take immediately to the idea of
watching a fine group of young
American stallions answer questions
concerning studliness in general.

It would all be so much more
interesting than all those idiotic
questions about politics, sports, and
other such absurd subjects.

The next morning, he popped his
idea to the Chief.

“That’s great, G. G.,”
Chief. “How did you ever think of
that?”

Intra-Mural Football
Begins Next Tuesday

By HOWIE KORMAN
I-M Editor

The 1961 intramural football season gets underway on
Tuesday, October 17, when the defending champion PiKA
meets Phi Gam in a 2 p.m. encounter on the I-M field.

According to head football official Larry Smail, three
games will be played on two days each week through Nov. 13.

In Progress

Washington and Lee intramurals
opened on September 27, with golf
and tennis matches being played.

Golf teams from 19 campus organi-
zations are participating.

One team in each of the four
leagues is presently undefeated.

Both the defending golf champions
Phi Delt and Phi Gam are unbeaten
in three matches in Leagues A and
B respectively.

SAE and KA lead Leagues C and
B®

Regular play in the leagues end
next Tuesday, with play-offs begin-
ning immedately after final pairings
are made.

Tennis

With only nine more matches re-
maining to be played, the I-M tennis
championships could be decided in
three of the four divisions in final
day competition. PiKA assured itself
of first place in League A by easily
downing Lambda Chi on October 12.

Also on Wednesday, Phi Kap cap-
tured part of first place in Division
B by upsetting previously undefeat-
ed SAE. Both houses have two and
one records, and have one more
contest to play. SAE will meet a

mediocre SPE unit, while the net-| opp

men from Phi Kap will face Pi Phi
on Wednesday, October 18.

In Division C, the championship
could be decided in the final match
of the year. If KA is able to down
Delt on October 16, they will meet
Beta in a battle of the undefeated.
To date Beta is 3-0, and KA has two
wins. On October 12, the league
leaders easily set back the netters
from Phi Gam 5-0.

Tuesday, October 17, Phi Delt will
meet Sigma Nu in a contest that will
decide first place in League D. Phi
Delt captured their third victory
against no defeats when they top-
ped ZBT 3-2 on Wednesday. Mickey
Bright, Gus Wick, and Giles Walton

While the rest of the student
body parties to all hours of the
morning tonight, Washington and

in two secluded Fairfield motels, far
from the revelry and rowidness on
the campus scene.

They’ll be alone out there, too.

Coach Mac is taking his entire
squad to Fairfield tonight imme-
diately after the 7:15 pep rally, just
to make sure that his boys are com-
pletely ready to go against Ran-
dolph-Macon tomorrow.

So dates, booze and combos are all
being left behind, all for the glory
of W&L football.

Watch out for them Saturday
night, though.

M Laughlin’s Charges Look ‘For

Third Straight 1961 Triumph

Washington and Lee’s undefeated
Generals go after their third straight
win tomorrow in a Homecoming
contest against the Randolph-Macon
Yellow Jackets.

Game time is 2 p.m. at Wilson
Field.

The Generals, who bombed
Franklin and Marshall 40-0 last Sat-
urday, are seeking their seventh
consecutive win over a_ two-year
period.

Better

Washington and Lee head coach
Lee McLaughlin says that Coach
Joe McCutcheon’s ‘Jackets are a
better team than their 1-2 record
indicates.

R-MC lost Saturday to Western
Maryland, 28-6, in a game where
the ‘Jackets had six passes inter-
cepted.

“Anytime you give up the ball six
or more times in a ball game through
mistakes, you’re going to get hurt,”
McLaughlin points out. “Take those
interceptions out of the game, and
Randolph-Macon may have been the
better team.”

McLaughlin says he expects the
Yellow Jackets to put greater pres-
sure on the W&L defense than either
of the Generals’ earlier opponents.

Typical

“Coach Boyd Williams scouted
Randolph-Macon and he says it’s a
‘typical’ Joe McCutcheon team,” Mc-
Laughlin adds. “They tackle well,
pursue well, block well, and they’ve

of beating us.”

And McLaughlin adds, “It goes
without saying that Randolph-Ma-
con wants this game very badly.
We haven’t been very generous
hosts on some other ocacsions.”

McLaughlin’s first college victory
came over Randolph-Macon in 1958,
when the Generals snapped a 12-
game losing streak by besting the
Jackets on Wilson Field, 13-12, in
the final 30 seconds. The next year,
again on Wilson Field, the Generals
came from behind twice, from 21-0
and 33-25, to tie R-MC in the final
45 seconds, 33-33. Last year’s score
was 26-3 for W&L, another come-
back effort at Ashland.

So far in two games, McLaughlin
has been disappointed in the ability

 

of his linemen to gouge gaps in op-
posing forward defenses. The down-
field blocking against F&M was ex-
ceptional, he says, but the problem
remains along the scrimmage line.

McLaughlin was pleased with the
general offensive showing W&L
made in its last outing. The Blue
team scored the first three TD’s,
the Red team got one, the Gold an-
other, and the previously untested
White squad came through with a
quick-striking, four-play touchdown
that featured the passing of sopho-
more A. J. Barranco.

Game time for the
Macon scrap is 2 p.m.

W&L spoiled the Randolph-Macon
homecoming last year with their
26-3 win, and the Jackets will be
trying to return the favor.

THE TRUE AND
HARROWING FACTS ABOUT RUSHING

It is well enougn to sit in one’s Morris chair and theorize about
sorority rushing, but if one really wishes to know the facts, one
must leave one’s Morris chair and go out into the field. (My
Morris chair, incidentally, was given to me by the Philip Morris
Company, makers of Marlboro Cigarettes. They are great-
hearted folk, the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, as millions of
you know who have enjoyed their excellent cigarettes. Only
from bountiful souls could come such mildness, such flavor,
such filters, such pleasure, as you will find in Marlboros! For
those who prefer crushproof boxes, Marlboro is available in
crushproof boxes. For those who prefer soft packs, Marlboro
is available in soft packs. For those who prefer to buy their
cigarettes in bulk, please contact Emmett R. Sigafoos, friendly
manager of our factory in Richmond, Virginia.)

But I digress. I was saying that in order to know the true
facts about sorority rushing, one must go into the field and
investigate. Consequently, I went last week to the Indiana
College of Spot Welding and Belles Lettres and interviewed
several million coeds, among them a lovely lass named Gerund
McKeever. (It is, incidentally, quite an interesting little story
about how she came to be named Gerund. It seems that her
father, Ralph T. McKeever, loved grammar better than any-
thing in the world, and so he named all his children after parts
of speech. In addition to Gerund, there were three girls named
Preposition, Adverb, and Pronoun, and one boy named Dative
Case. The girls seemed not to be unduly depressed by their
names, but Dative Case, alas, grew steadily more morose and
was finally found one night dangling from a participle. After
this tragic event, the father abandoned his practice of gram-
matical nomenclature, and whatever children were subsequently
born to him—eight in all—were named Everett.)

But I digress. I was interviewing a lovely coed named
Gerund McKeever. “Gerund,” I said, “‘were you rushed by a
sorority?”

“Yes, mister,” she said, “I was rushed by a sorority.”

“Did they give you a high-pressure pitch?” I asked. “Did
they use the hard sell?”

“No, mister,” she replied. “It was all done with quiet dignity.
They simply talked to me about the chapter and the girls for
about three minutes and then I pledged.”

“My goodness!”’ I said. ‘““Three minutes is not very long for
a sales talk!’

“It is when they are holding you under water, mister,”
said Gerund.

“Well, Gerund,” I said, ‘Show do you like the house?”

“T like the house fine, mister,” she replied. “But I don’t live
there. Unfortunately, they pledged more girls than they have
room for, so they are sleeping some of us in the bell tower.”

“Isn’t that rather noisy?” I said.

“Only on the quarter-hour,” said Gerund.

“Well, Gerund,”’ I said, “it has certainly been a pleasure talk-
ing to you,’ I said.

“Likewise, mister,” she said, and with many a laugh and cheer
we went our separate ways—she to the campanile, I to the

were shot at Washington and
Lee’s College Bowl team can-

didates in the past two days
as testing to pick the team moved
into a more intensive stage.

The tests were taken by 25 men,
a third of the number which tried
the first test two weeks ago.

Five men were called “head and
shoulders above the others” by
Presidential Assistant Frank Par-
sons, who is charged with picking
and instructing the team. Tom Ly-
bass, Bill Lowry, Jim Campbell,
Rick Anderson, and Greg McNab are
now the foremost candidates for the
four team positions.

Parsons noted the fact that only
one of the present top five, McNabb,
is a fraternity member, while the
remaining four are independents.

McNabb and Anderson are seniors;
Campbell and Lowry, juniors, and
Lybass is a sophomore.

The oral tests simulate conditions
on the quiz bowl show, emphasizing
quick recall of detailed knowledge.
Several faculty members assisted
Parsons in administering the tests.
The first tests required written an-
swers only, although the time limit
of 20 seconds per answer has re-
mained the same for all tests.

Charts are kept for all candidates
to determine their rank in the group,
their nubmer of correct answers on
each test, and the areas in which
they exhibit the most thorough
knowledge.

The W&L College Bowl team will
appear on CBS television on Nov. 12.
The candidates may receive an ear-
lier workout on radio, said Parsons,
if some technical difficulties can be
solved. A radio trial would help to
determine the team members by pre-
senting the aspirants in actual com-
petition atmosphere before an au-
dience.

here for a special two-week instruc-

The laboratory will be available to
faculty and advanced science stu-
dents for basic instruction in radio-
isotope techniques, according to an
announcement by Dr. Edward F.
Turner, Jr., Chairman of the de-
partment of physics.

Dr. .William K. Robinson, a phys-
icist from St. Lawrence University,
will be the principal instructor rep-
resenting the Oak Ridge Institute
of Nuclear Studies (ORINS), the
organization which sponsors the
laboratory’s tours to colleges and
universities throughout the United
States.

Instructor for the second week of
classes will be Dr. Kay Ezell, a

institute, will be in charge of labor-
atory work in the mobile unit,
which will be stationed next to Reid
Hall. Classroom instruction will be
held in University rooms.

This will be the first time the mo-
bile laboratory has been brought to
the Washington and Lee campus.
However, the unit has been set up
at other colleges in Virginia.

The Oak Ridge Mobile Radioiso-

tope Training Laboratory Program
was first conceived in 1958 by ORINS
and two vehicles for laboratory use
were presented to the International
Atomic Energy Agency for demon-
stration at Geneva late that year.
After successful tours of European
universities, a third vehicle was de-
signed for use in the United States
beginning in the Fall of 1959.

endowed with greater natural re-
sources than our nation, the differ-
ences between the two colonizing
peoples, the English and the Portu-
guese, contributed heavily to the
formation of these societies.

Carter added that some other great
nations came into existence in the
absence of any resources. He named
the Aztecs, Incas, and Chinese as
examples of this phenomenon.

He contended that, particularly in
the colonial years, the poor New
England soil brought forth from the
settlers great demonstrations of hu-
man ingenuity, pointing out that
under the free enterprise system
they “made a silk purse from a
sow’s ear.”

After completing his talk Dr.
Carter held a brief discussion per-
iod in which topics ranging from
the Amazon River Basin to Com-
munism were discussed.

Record Attendance Expected
For Annual Parents’ Weekend;

New Conference

By STEVE GUILD

Executive News Editor

Washington and Lee University will play host to some
800 mothers, fathers, and guardians of students for the sev-
enth annual Parents’ Weekend on October 27, 28, 29.

Advanced reservations for housing and tickets to the par-
ents’ luncheon show that attendance for the weekend will prob-

ably be the largest since the pro-*

gram was begun in 1955.

Parents’ Weekend is under the
sponsorship of the University and
the Parents’ Advisory Council, with
arrangements for housing and pro-
grams handled by the University
Development Office.

Registration for parents and other
guests will open at 10 am. Friday
and will continue until 9 p.m. that
night. Parents wishing conferences
will be able to meet faculty mem-
bers that afternoon.

Procedure Different

This year the procedure for ar-
ranging conferences will be some-
what different than that in the past.
Conferences will have to be made
by the student with faculty mem-
bers instead of the former method
of arranging them through the Uni-
versity Development Office. Stu-
dents are urged to make these ap-

pointments as soon as possible with |

their professors.

On Friday afternoon, The Parents’
Advisory Council will meet at 2:30
in the conference room of Evans
Dining Hall. Richard T. Edwards of
Roanoke is the 1961 chairman of
the council.

Chemistry Talk

Also on Friday afternoon the
chemistry department will hold its
weekly seminar and tea. Mr. J. W.
Reynolds will speak on “Free Radi-
cal Mechanisms.”

For the Friday night discussions
this year, the subjects will center
around two of the present trouble
spots of the world.

In duPont Auditorium at 8:00 the
topic for discussion will be “Berlin:
a Problem for the West” and “A
Problem for the Soviet Bloc.” Dr.
Milton Colvin, associate professor
of political science will take the
Western side, and Associate Pro-
fessor of History Dr. T. P. Hughes
will take the side of the Soviet
Union. Presiding at this session will
be Steve Galef.

“Leftist Movements”

The second discussion group will
concern “Leftist Movements in
South America,” and both Dr. Leon
F. Sensabaugh, Professor of History
and Dr. Charles W. Turner will dis-
cuss this problem. The group will

meet in Lee Chapel also at 8:00.

The highlight of the Saturday
schedule will be the “Report to
Parents” by University and stu-
dent body officials. The 11:00 am.
program will open with a talk by
Uncas McThenia, president of the
student body. This report will be
followed by talks from Dr. William
W. Pusey, dean of the college; Dr.
Lewis W. Adams, dean of the school
of commerce and administration;
Professor Charles P. Light, dean of
the school of law; and Frank J. Gil-

| Final Testing

For Bowl Team

\Is Tomorrow

A final testing session Wed-
nesday night will narrow the
field of candidates for Wash-
ington and Lee’s GE College
Bowl team to eight sharp-wit-
ted students.

The four finalists who will
make up the team for the Novem-
ber 12 appearance on CBS network
television will be selected following
a “dress rehearsal” live radio broad-
cast over WREL Thursday at 9 p.m.

John K. Jennings, director of the
Communications Laboratory of the
Lee Memorial Journalism Founda-
tion, has arranged for a 45-minute
show patterned after the old Col-
lege Quiz Bowl, the radio predeces-
sor of the current popular TV ser-
ies.

Two Teams Compete

The eight semi-finalists will be
divided into two teams of four each,
and the game will involve “toss-
up” and “bonus” questions fired at
the participants by Frank Parsons,

university staff member who has #
Se

assisted in the preliminary selection
process.

Although team scores will be kept,
Parsons will rely on individual rec-
ords
finalists to four .

475 Questions Asked

To date, candidates have been sub-
jected to some 175 written-answer
questions designed to determine the
breadth of their knowledge in many
fields, and nearly 300 oral-answer
questions designed to indicate the
rapidity with which the candidates
can recall specific fact.

Plans are also in the works for
an appearance on area television a
week prior to the network show
from New York. The team has been
invited to appear on “College on
Camera,” a Sunday afternoon half-
hour program over WDBJ-TV,
Channel 7, in Roanoke, on November
5. The show, taped in advance on
October 31, would involve inter-
views with team members and an|
abbreviated contest among _ indivi-
duals with College Bowl type ques-
tions.

Two Alternates

Although the GE College Bow!
makes no call for the selection of
alternates for the team, Parsons said
he planned to select two alternates
who would be available for the New|
York trip in the event of sickness |
or other incapacity of one or more|
of the regulars.

The Washington and Lee team will
travel to New York on November 11

Sunday, November 12.

 

The controversial “Hot Nuts
Combo” has been officially banned
from the W&L campus, members of
the IFC were told last night.

The rule, which was handed down
to the IFC by the Office of the Dean
of Students, goes further in the
bann—it says the group cannot ap-
at any function on or off campus.

The rule, Assistant Dean of
Student James D. Farrar, said,
applies to all 18 fraternities and to
all social organizations, fraternal
or otherwise.

Dean Farrar reported that the
action resulted from a series of com-
plaints received on the combo this
past weekend.

Complaints came in from members |
of the faculty and from alumni, he

 

said.
“Hot Nuts” Have a History

In 1959, the “Hot Nuts” first took |
the spotlight. On Oct. 12, 1959, the!
IFC debated the issue at consider-|
able length. The debate resulted in|
a request to the fraternities that!

they use descrition in hiring the
the group.

At that time it was felt that a
ban would not solve the problem,
as it was felt that each house
should see that the combo did not
play “off-color” songs.

In the Spring of 1958 this combo
was the focal point of a near riotous
fraternity party which had to be
quelled by Lexington Police.

W&L Freshmen Better Qualified

 

The Tuesday Staff Speaks .. .

 

EMPHASIS

By ANDY NEA
Managing Editor

With the ever increasing number of applications, colleges in the
United States have been forced to become more selective.

Here at W&L the increase in applicants has been noticed. How-

ever, in the past four years, the incoming freshman classes have
remained approximately the same size. Rather than increasing the
student body, the calibre of tht student has been raised.
Each year, more and more is required of the candidates for admis-
sion to W&L. Next year for the first time, the Scholastic Achieve-
ment Tests will be required of each aplicant as well as the Scholastic
Aptitude Test.

The Achievement Tests consist of an English test as well as two
tests from either the natural science, mathematics, foreign languages
or social studies groups. With the additional information from these
tests, the admissions staff will have more knowledge on a candidate’s
abilities.

Over the past four years, the Scholastic Aptitude scores of in-
coming freshmen have continually increased. Each year, both the
verbal and math medians of the classes have risen over that of past
classes.

Year Verbal Math
1958 528 553
1959 532 563
1960 554 577
1961 565 599

Out of 1252 high school seniors who presented completed apli-
cations to W&L for considerations this fall, 542 acceptances were
issued. Those accepted represents 42 per cent of the total making
complete applications for admission. Of the 542 who received ac-
ceptances, 318 enrolled this year as freshmen. It is significant to note
that 73 per cent of the freshmen accepted were in the top quarter
of their high school classes.

The Admissions Staff has increased its efforts to find better qual-
ified students for W&L. A greater emphasis is being placed upon
sending representatives from W&L to the different public and private
schools. This enables the Admissions Staff to more carefully screen
the perspective applicants.

Another example of the increased selectivity of the Admissions
Staff has been the growth of the student body in respect to the size
of the classes accepted. While freshmen classes have remained ap-
proximately the same size over the past four years, the student body
has increased by 85. This shows that the incoming students are bet-

.ter prepared and that larger numbers are remaining for graduation.

The faculty has been doing its part in increasing the standards of
the school. Over the past four years, the faculty has been increased.
Also, more members of the faculty now hold doctorate degrees than
ever before. In addition, new research grants have been obtained
and research work has been stimulated.

New construction has been another area of expansion and im-
provement. Next year, a new freshman dormitory will be completed.
While the freshman class is expected to be approximately 330, an
increase of only ten students, better facilities will be offered. The
new science building marks another step forward in the improvement
of the University. The new building will provide more modern fa-
cilities for students in all academic classes. However, it is noteworthy
that W&L is expanding its facilities to meet the new academic
challenge.

Today, the curriculum has been expanded to meet the needs of
the “New Age” freshmen. This year marks the instigation of a
new and more advanced course in mathematics. The old freshman
math course has given way to a more comprehensive and complete
one. The English Department has also expanded to meet the needs
of the new freshmen. This year, the advanced section has been en-
larged because of the increased number of freshmen who qualify
for advanced placement.

In addition, more is now expected of the new freshmen. New
academic restrictions have been placed upon them. The automatic
rule has been raised and a higher grade point ratio is now required.
Also, the absence regulations have been tightened. Now,

Other officers were Dick Canter-
bury’ of West Virginia, vice presi-
dent; Mike Pitt of VMI, secretary,
and Sam Smith, a graduate of Mar-
shall University, historian.

Has An Active Career

A ZBT pledge from Louisville,
Ky., Boiarsky had an active high
school career. He attended Kiskie
Preparatory School in the tenth
and the first half of the eleventh
grades. While there, he played foot-
ball, was co-captain of the varsity
wrestling team, lettered in varsity
track, was a member of the debate
team, and was elected to the school’s
literary society.

In the last half of the eleventh
grade, Boiarsky attended Atherton
High School where he edited the
literary magazine and ran varsity
track.

Edited Literary Magazine

Transferring to Wagner High
School in his senior year, he was
editor-in-chief of the literary maga-
zine and ran varsity track.

At Washington and Lee, Boiarsky
is a reporter for the Ring-tum Phi.
He said that he also plans to join
the wrestling and track teams when
the seasons open.

Bishop Has Experience
Thurmond Bishop also presents a
record of qualifying experience. He
was a Dean’s List student and a re-
cipient of the Distinguished Military

A University-Owned Parking Lot

Needs Immediate Attention

One of the most prevalent problems that presently con-
fronts Washington and Lee seems to be the parking situation.
We find that this problem not only is confined to our cam-
pus, but that the dilemma also extends to University proper-
ty located off campus.

Specifically, we are speaking of the University owned
parking lot located next to the Pi Kappa Alpha house and
behind the Beta Theta Pi house.

From information gathered from officials of one of these
houses, it seems that a number of pleas which have requested
improvements for this lot have fallen on deaf ears.

Officials of this fraternity have more than once requested
action to remedy the poor condition of this lot, but their re-
quests have been to no avail.

Members of the PiKA fraternity are forced to park their
cars on Main Street, since the lot is in such poor condition
that it is virtually impossible to get cars on it. As a result
of having to park on a main street, three of the PiKA’s cars
have been involved in accidents this year alone. The expense
of these collisions, it seems to us, is unnecessary, and with

 

This picture shows the shabby condition of the University- owned parking lot next to the PiKA house.

a decent place to park these expenses would not be necessary.

Both the above named fraternities have agreed to pay
for having the lot surfaced with gravel if the University
would have the area graded with their machinery. Action was
promised last spring, but still no work has been done on the
lot.

Another added imposition resulting from the poor con- *

munism, and its goal is to show the American public the ser-

iousness of that threat to our

way of life.

It is our hope that Washington and Lee students will take
the time tonight to see this film. We can promise you that
the time spent viewing “Operation Abolition” will not be

wasted.

houses to get service from food distributors, since they can-
not get their trucks in and out of the lot.

It seems to us that with co-operation from the University
this problem could easily be solved.
A request by students to the University that results in
no action is not characteristic of this Administration. We
hope that a “no help” trend has not started here.

Don’t Miss ‘Operation Abolition’

Tonight’s showing of ‘Operation Abolition” should at-
tract a large crowd of viewers, for this film is reported to be
one of the most controversial pictures that has been distrib-
uted during the last few years.

The film, as we understand it, gives an “inside view” of
Communist activities which are taking place within the
United States today, and the subject centers around the re-
cent rioting that marked a session of the House Un-American
Activities Committee which was meeting in San Francisco

rounded series of laboratory experi-
ments and lectures will be presented,
covering the basic radioactive count-
ing techniques and applications of
radioisotopes in the fields of biology,
chemistry, and physics.

Special Training

The Mobile Lab program is de-
signed to provide faculty members
and advanced science majors at un-
dergraduate institutions the oppor-
tunity for specialized training in
the techniques and applications of
radioisotopes.

The present program and mobile
lab is the only one of its kind in
the United States. In 1958 two mobile
laboratories were built by the Oak
Ridge Institute for Nuclear Studies
(ORINS) for the International Atom-
ic Energy Agency in Geneva. These
were donated to the agency and
have been in constant use in Europe
and South America since that time.
In 1959, when the value of the pro-
gram was graphically illustrated by
its effectiveness in foreign lands,
ORINS built a third mobile lab, and
it has traveled the area trom Texas
to Maryland and from Kentucky to
Puerto Rico. Plans are in the mak-
ing now for the building of a second
laboratory to cover a larger area in
the U.S.

Second Va. School

Washington and Lee is the second
school in Virginia to have the mobile
lab. Last year a two-week course
was given at Hampden-Sydney. The
Institute plans the traveling sche-
dule so that no more than one
school in a state may receive the
laboratory once a year.

The course consists of one 90
minute lecture given at 4:30 to 6:00
every day in Reid Hall and two lab
sessions at 10:00 to 12:00 in the
morning and 7:00 to 9:00 in the eve-
ning.

The laboratory which is contained
entirely in the mobile unit has an
almost hospital-like appearance
with well-scrubbed floors, a certain
antiseptic smell, and a crowded but
organized atmosphere. The forward
portion of the van contains the
radioactive counting room. There
are three identical setups along one
counter which will accommodate
six people. Each setup contains a

Geiger counter and a scintillation
spectrometer. The counts taken
from the samples put into the

counters are read off of a compli-
cated looking bevy of instruments.

 

 

All of the instruments in the mobile
lab are standard equipment, basical-
ly the same that is found at ORINS.
In a second section the space is
taken up by three radiochemical
fume hoods, a Geiger counter, a ra-
diation storage vault, and other
standard laboratory quipment.

Since this program is the only one
of its kind in the United States, the
man who was chosen to conduct
the program throughout the operat-
ing area is of a special breed. Mr.
Tom Stone, whose official title is
Reasearch Assistant with ORINS,

Leaf Raker Uncovers Plot
To Tamper With IBM

BY THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

Well, Openings is definitely closed.

I guess since it has been shut up*
tight for two days, everybody has
gotten together to
tell of all the he-
roic, chivalric
deeds performed
in defense of
nothing, and also
sung the praises of
all the tunes of
glory performed
in bigger - than -
life realism with
much more noise
than juke-boxes
ever make. So, I
won't fool around with Openings.

Instead, I think it fitting to re-|
veal a plot which was afoot to take
over W&L and use it as a head-
quarters to abolish the House Un-
American Activities Committee. But

would have been thoroughly and |}
summarily executed, and all the!

conservatives would have been forc-
ed to wear their old Brooks Brothers
pink shirts and read the Wash-
ington Post editorials about “Oper-
ation Abolition.”

The raker, j.g., a transient from
Snide, Nevada, noticed for some
time that there was always a big
crowd of guys in trench-coats down
by the bridge at night. Remembering
his scout oath of loyalty to em-
ployer, this anonymous hero (who
must go unnamed for obvious rea-
sons) questioned one of the sinis-
ter figures about the cases of trans-
istors that their imported African
warriors kept carrying into a big |

 

 

camouflaged cave in the side of the
hill.

The sinister figure calmly an-
swered that the boys were IBM
repairmen, and that they always
came to fix the machine in the
dead of night.

Our hero made a simple deduc-
tion from this revelation (It’s not
the dead of night now,” he thought
cleverly), and immediately called
the proctor who sneaked out of the
concert, chopped up the transistor
cases, and saved us all last week,

“They need more supervision. I
feel that two chaperones should be

As long as we pick the chaperones.)

“The Sem motto is ‘Never believe

you.)

“They drive too fast on the way
back.” (And who’s trying to beat
the deadline?)

“They are always trying to take
advantage of you.”

“The longer they stay at W&L the
more conceited they get.”

“A few are drunken idiots who
seem to have forgotten their man-
ners.”

On the slim ‘for’ side were:

“I think they are a fine group
of Southern gentlemen. (Wonder
who she’s pinned to?)

“Wild but I like their parties.”
(A freeloader.)

“I never know how to feel when
I'm with a W&L man. They’ll all

Generals Roll Over Randolph - Macon, 43-0

 

LEELA AAA AAA EARLE

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Managing Editor

Coach Lee McLaughlin’s Un-

| touchables cut down another gangs-
, ter mob Saturday.

The victim — Randolph-Macon —
was doomed from the very start as

| the Untouchables steathily stalked to
' a 43-0 decision.

But exciting heroics were pro-
vided by W&L’s untouchable de
fense, not by its massive offensive
machine.

The shutout was the defensive
unit’s second straight and fourth in
its last five games over a two-year
span. In W&L’s last 12 games the
most points scored by an oppenent is
eight by Johns Hopkins and Se-
wanee,

The University of North Carolina
and N. C. State stopped the W&L
booters cold on their two-day trip
last week.

The Tar Heels bounced W&L, 4-1,
Wednesday and the Wolfpack added
a 1-0 licking Thursday.

In the UNC contest W&L had a
difficult time in setting up plays.
The Tar Heels took advantage of
this confusion to pump home the
first goal early in the first period.

Shank Shatters Course Record;
W&L 2nd In 3-Way X-C Meet

A record-breaking performance by
Mike Shank wasn’t enough to off-
set a balanced bunch of Bridgewater
runners in Saturday’s triangular
cross-country meet here.

 

Sports Star Of The Week

Week’s Award
Goes To Shank,
X-C Co-Capt.

Cross-country is as rugged and
grueling a sport as there is today,
yet its participants seldom receive
their just recognition.

There is one member of the Wash-
ington and Lee squad, however, who
rates the distinction of being our
Sports Star of the Week. Mike
Shank a SPE junior from Philadel-
phia, set a course record of 24:20
in a triangular meet against Lynch-
burg College and Bridgewater last
Saturday.

Trimming 1:30 seconds off the
previous record, “Ironhorse” as
Coach Dick Miller has tabbed
Shank, is co-captain of the team,

Shank is also a standout long
and middle distance man on Coach
Norm Lord’s undefeated track team.

 

“Besides being the best runner
on our squad,” Miller said, “Mike’s
attitude is such that it instills
everybody on the team with a de-
sire to win regardless of the op-
ponent.”

Shank, who has been a star among
the harriers since his freshman year,
is an officer of his fraternity and
is a member of the University Chris-
tian Association.

Shank, the Generals’ top runner
this year, captured first place but
Bridgewater copped the next five
finishing positions, winning the
meet with a low total of 21 points.
W&L was second with 52, while
Lynchburg’s 56-point total placed
them third.

Shank covered the 4.1 mile lo-
cal course in 14:20, the lowest time
ever posted by any runner since
the route was revamped recently.

Mac Brownlee was Washington
and Lee’s second best scorer, plac-
ing sixth in 25:47. Rick Rogers was
twelfth, Norm Youngblood  six-
tenth and Andy Kilpatrick eigh-
teenth for the Generals.

Richmond Next

The combination win over Lynch-
burg and loss to Bridgewater gave
the Generals a 4-2 won-lost slate
for the season. They will meet Rich-
mond a week from Saturday in their
next outing.

Coach Dick Miller was satisfied} @

with the performances of Shank
and Brownlee and said he expected
another credible performance against
Richmond.

Generals, 1-0

but a goal by center forward Dave
Knight pushed the Generals back
into the game. Another penalty kick
and a well executed indirect kick
added two more tallies for the Tar
Heels and iced the game for Caro-
lina.

At North Carolina State, the Gen-
erals ran into their problem of not
being able to finish off their plays
in front of the goal. This lack of
finesse resulted in the W&L booters
taking an incredible 46 shots with-
out a single score.

The Generals dominated play, con-
trolling the ball in the Wolfpack half
of the field all afternoon, but a
State penalty kick was enough to
give them a 1-0 win.

Coach Lyles in commenting on
the two games feels that W&L play-
ed well against the Tar Heels, but
were a bit outclassed as far as ex-
perience goes. With both Jim Stark-
ey and Tom Clements out with in-
juries, there is a lack of stability
and experienced players.

The booters play Lynchburg Col-
lege today in Lynchburg and will
meet Duke on Wilson Field this
Thursday.

‘ occasion did the ‘Jackets get beyond
. the W&L 40.

Led by linebacker Terry Fohs,
and guards Tommy Goodwin and
Bob Payne, the W&L defense
completely smothered the Ran-
dolph-Macon ground attack. The
‘Jackets turned to the airways, and

* completed as many passes to W&L
defenders as to their own men.

Randolph-Macon attempted 26
aerials, completed seven, and had
five intercepted.

Fohs, Stu Yoffe, and Brice Gam-
ber picked off one R-M pass apiece
while Robin Wood intercepted two
‘Jacket passes.

Yoffe’s interception was one of
the game highlights. The sophomore
halfback leaped high with both
arms extended to snag Lee Krost’s
aerial.

Capitalizing on four breaks,
Washington and Lee breezed to a
28-0 halftime lead. Their longest
drive was 44 yards. Their shortest,
two yards.

Six backs shared the scoring hon-
ors for the Generals; but only one—
quarterback Chuck Lane—had a
hand in two touchdown plays.

The junior signal-caller tossed a
15-yard pass to fullback Doug Mar-
tin in the second period and boot-
legged 10 yards down the left side-
line for the fifth W&L score in the
third period. His run climaxed the

With only 2:50 gone in the first

THE DATING SEASON

I have recently returned from a tour of 950,000 American col-
leges where I made a survey of undergraduate dating customs
and sold mechanical dogs, and I have tabulated my findings
and I am now prepared to tell you the simple secret of successful
dating.

The simple secret is simply this: a date is successful when the
man knows how to treat the girl.

And how does a girl like to be treated? If you want to know,
read and remember these four cardinal rules of dating:

1. A girl likes to be treated with respect.

When you call for your girl, do not drive up in front of the
sorority house and yell, ‘Hey, fat lady!’ Get out of your car.
Walk respectfully to the door. Knock respectfully. When your
girl comes out, tug your forelock and say respectfully, ‘“Good
evening, your honor.’’ Then offer her a Marlboro, for what
greater respect can you show your girl than to offer Marlboro
with its fine flavor and exclusive selectrate filter? It will in-
dicate immediately that you respect her taste, respect her dis-
cernment, respect her intelligence. So, good buddies, before
going out on a date, always remember to buy some Marlboros,
available in soft pack or flip-top box in all 50 of the United
States and also Cleveland.

   

“téen to te Paes

2. A girl likes a good listener.

 

SJ btn likes to

Do not monopolize the conversation. Let her talk while you
listen attentively. Make sure, however, that she is not herself
a good listener. I recollect a date I had once with a coed named
Greensleeves Sigafoos, a lovely girl, but unfortunately a listener,

not a talker. I too was a listener so we just sat all night long,
each with his hand cupped over his ear, straining to catch a
word, not talking hour after hour until finally a policeman came
by and arrested us both for vagrancy. I did a year and a day.
She got by with a suspended sentence because she was the sole
support of her aged housemother.

3. A girl likes to be taken to nice places.

By “nice” places I do not mean expensive places. A girl does
not demand luxury. All she asks is a place that is pleasant and
gracious. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, for example. Or
Mount Rushmore. Or the Taj Mahal. Or the Bureau of Weights
and Measures. Find places like these to take your girl. In no
circumstances must you take her to an oil-cracking plant.

4. A girl likes a man to be well-informed.

Come prepared with a few interesting facts that you can drop
casually into the conversation. Like this: “Did you know,

Snookiepuss, that when cattle, sheep, camels, goats, antelopes,
and other members of the cud-chewing family get up, they al-
ways get up hind legs first?” Or this: “Are you aware, Hotlips,

that corn grows faster at night?” Or this: “By the way, Lover-
head, Oslo did not become the capital of Norway till July 11,

1924.”

If you can slip enough of these nuggets into the conversation
before dinner, your date will grow too torpid to eat. Some men
save up to a half million dollars a year this way.

Conservatives To Sponsor Film

The newly-formed Conservative
Society of Washington and Lee will
sponsor the screening of the highly-
controversial film “Operation Aboli-
tion” this evening at 7:30 in duPont
Auditorium.

The guest speaker will be Robert
Goldsboro, a former investigator
for the House Committee on Un-
American Activities. Goldsboro, who
is replacing William Cotter, the
original speaker, will give the short
talk preceding the film and answer
questions afterwards.

The film itself is a 45-minute doc-
umentary showing demonstrations
against a House Un-American Activ-
ities subcommittee in San Francsico
in May of 1960. Narrated by Ful-
ton Lewis, III, well-known news
commentator, the film has been seen
by over 25 million people since it
was released in July of 1960. The
original film was made by camer-
men for television stations in and
around San Francisco.

Realizing the educational bene-
fits of the film, the film was sub-
poenaed with no resulting objections
from the television stations, and was
copied by Video Productions Incor-
porated, of Washington for the House

done in such a cloak and dagger
way was not so overtly subversive
as it might appear.

What those sneaks were really
going to do was replace key parts
in the machine with a plan in mind.

All the D’s in French were go-
ing to be B-, and all the C’s in
Organic would go to D’s. The outs
would be in, the ins would be out,
since it was to happen on a Satur-
day everyone neither in nor out
would be left in limbo permanent-
ly.

As the initial shock wore off, and
party lines were reformed, continual
harassment would have been kept
up. One especially clever plan was
to switch everyone’s major to Amer-
ican History, and force everyone to
take Marriage and the Family at
8:25, TTS.

When their plans were complete
the band of cutthroats planned to
link our machine with others, but
thanks to the alertness, fast-thinking
and acting of an ordinary nameless
citizen, we’re still safe, and the IBM
machine is just peacefully eating
punched cards, unaware of what
foul ends it might have had to
satisfy in the line of duty.

Committee on Un-American Activi-
ties use.

Much emotional controversy has
developed in the nation since the
first showing of the film. The film
has been called a biased attempt by
the House Committee to justify their
job in defending America against in-
ternal Communist subversion. In
defense of the film, its supporters
have stated that it should be rec-
ognized as real proof of the exist-
ence of subversion, and that the
American people should awaken to
the challenge therein exposed.

likes to more modestly think of him-
self as a general handyman whose
duties include everything from driv-
er to electronic technician and from
janitor to laboratory instructor.
With a wife and family at home
Mr. Stone is on the road a good por-
tion of the time. In reply to why he
took the job Mr. Stone said that
“he was the only one fool enough to
volunteer.”

While Mr. Stone operates the lab-
oratory, the lecture sections are
conducted by instructors brought
here from other institutions. The
physics portion of the course, which
will take up the first week, will be
conducted by Dr. William K. Rob-
inson from St. Lawrence University.
The second week Dr. E. K. Ezell
from ORINS will conduct the bio-
chemical series of lectures. While
the laboratory sections are restrict-
ed to the teachers and special stu-
dents taking the course, the lectures
are open to the public.

As Mr. Stone explained, the lab-
oratory program affords the oppor-
tunity to smaller colleges and uni-
versities to work with equipment
and radioactive materials that are
too expensive to obtain or for which
there is no special training. In this
way knowledge of the handling of
radioactive materials, can be spread
to a larger area with the mobile unit.
This essentially, then, is one more
program financed by the government
and directéd by an agency of the
government to upgrade the quality
of educational institutions.

Washington and Lee’s Parents’
Weekend program has won two first-
place national awards from the
American Alumni Council since its
inception.

In 1955 the overall program was
judged the best in the nation, and
in 1957 the Washington and Lee
Notes, a newsletter for parents, was
a blue-ribbon winner.

course. These regulations are designed to promote more conscien-

With the increased demands being placed upon the incoming
classes, the quality of the W&L student is increasing. It has risen to
such a degree that many students who were accepted four years ago
would probably not be accepted today.

All right. But what can I do for the Air Force?

The Air Force needs college trained men and women
as officers. This is caused by the rapidly advancing
technology that goes with hypersonic air and space
flight. Your four years of college have equipped you

Say I was interested... how can I get to be an officer?

You know about Air Force ROTC and the Air Force
Academy. Then there’s the navigator training pro-
gram. You’ve probably heard about Officer Training
School...where the Air Force takes certain college
graduates, both men and women, and commissions
them after three months of training.

Starting salary is important. What about that?

Add it up. Base pay, tax-free allowances, free medi-
cal and dental care, retirement provision, perhaps
flight pay. You don’t have to be an eco major to see
it adds up to an attractive package.

I’ve been thinking about getting my Master’s,

As an officer you can apply for the Air Force Institute
of Technology. At no cost, and while on active duty
some officers may even win their Ph.D. degrees.

That’s the job of your local Air Force Recruiter.

Record Crowd

Expected For
Parents’ Meet

The Dean’s office urges that
there be no student parking on
campus from Friday morning un-
til noon Saturday of Parents’
Weekend.

More than 850 parents and guests
of Washington and Lee University
students will visit the campus Oc-
tober 27-29 for the seventh annual
Parents’ Weekend.

Housing and luncheon ticket res-
ervations indicate the weekend at-
tendance may top any year since the
program was begun in 1955. Pur-
pose of the weekend is to provide
students’ parents with an oppor-
tunity to visit the campus, hold in-
dividual conferences with faculty
members and hear reports from uni-
versity student body officers.

A schedule similar to past week-
ends will keep the guests busy be-
ginning with registration at 10 a.m.
Friday and ending with a Glee
Club concert at 8:30 Saturday night.
Parents are invited to attend church
services of their choice Sunday
morning.

Advisory Council

Highpoint of Friday afternoon’s
activities will be a meeting of the
Parents’ Advisory Council in Evans
Dining Hall. Richard T. Edwards
of Roanoke is the 1961 chairman of
the council, and his successor will
be elected at this session.

Among top events of each parents’
weekend have been public faculty
discussions. Dr. Milton Colvin, as-
sociate professor of political science,
and Dr. Thomas P. Hughes, asso-
ciate professor of history, will talk
about “Berlin: A Problem for the
West.” They will speak in duPont
Auditorium. “Leftist Movements in
South America and the Economic
Stakes” will be discussed in Lee
Chapel by Dr. Leon F. Sensabaugh
and Dr. Charles W. Turner, both
professors of history. These pro-
grams begin at 8 p.m. Friday.

University President and Mrs.
Fred C. Cole will entertain parents
at the president’s home following
the discussions.

The annual “Report to Parents” by
university administrative officers will
be the highlight of Saturday morn-
ing’s schedule. The program will
open with a talk by student body
President Andrew W. McThenia, Jr.,
of Alderson, West Va. The deans of
the College, School of Commerce
and Administration and the School
of Law and the dean of students will
will also give reports. President Cole
will close the program with a sum-
mary of his work.

Guest and faculty members will
attend a buffet luncheon from noon
until 1:45 p.m. in the university’s
dining hall.

A 2 p.m football game between
Washington and Lee and Emory and
Henry will climax the afternoon’s
activities for guests.

One of the most popular features
of past parents’ weekends has been
the opportunity to meet face to face
with faculty members during speci-
ally-aranged conferences. These will
be held Friday afternoon and Sat-
urday morning for interested par-
ents.

Parents’ Weekend—rated by the
American Alumni Council in 1959 as
the best in the nation—is under the
joint sponsorship of Washington
and Lee and the 50-member Par-
ents’ Advisory Council. This special
council is a body whose special in-
terest in the university affords an
effective communications channel
between Washington and parents.

Arrangements for the weekend are
made by a special faculty commit-
tee.

 

Collegian Will Appear
On Weekend of Nov. 18

The Southern Collegian will be
released on the Washington and
Lee campus on November 18. This
is a home football game weekend,
and is one week before Thanksgiving
vacation.

Publication of The Southern Col-
legian for Openings Dance Set was
unavoidably delayed due to color
printing difficulties out of town.
Were the Collegian staff capable of
regretting this delay and the in-
convenience suffered by W&L men
by not having the opportunity to
read the Collegian on schedule, it
certainly would regret it. How-
ever...

and Lee Director of Publicity Frank Parsons. From left to right, they are Rusty McNab,

Parsons said that the team will be announced Monday.

Mock Quiz Bowl On WREL
Is Final Test For Team Berths

By SPENSER RAGSDALE

Quiz Bowl fever is still rampant.
As the tension upon the eight re-
maining boys mounts, speculation
is running high as to who our rep-
resentatives will be.

Thursday night radio station
WREL presented a simulated Quiz
Bowl program. Art Portnoy intro-
duced the program and said that
the accuracy, speed, and overall per-
formance of the boys during this
show would be collated with pre-
vious testing results to pick the four
members and two alternates that will
compose the team.

Frank Parsons explained the op-
eration of the show and asked the
various toss-up and bonus ques-
tions. The Blue Team consisted of
Tom Lybass, Jim Campbell, Ed
Brown, and Rusty McNab. Bill
Lowry, Cal Morrow, Rick Ander-
son, and Thorns Craven were on
the opposing Red Team.

“What is a lycanthrope?”
A buzzer sounded and Mr. Par-

 

sons asked the first question of the
evening: “If you came across a
‘lycanthrope, would you be most apt
to give him a big kiss, saddle him
up, run like crazy.” Jim Camp-
bell punched his bell and answered
correctly, “Run like crazy; it’s a
werewolf.”

The Blue Team thus gained the
advantage at the beginning of the
match. They were to maintain this
lead to a 230 to 95 half-time score
and throughout the second half, in
spite of the Red Team comeback,
to a 515 to 320 final victory.

Lybass Shines

The few people present during
the broadcasting were continually
astounded at the uncanny alarcity
of the eight minds. Tom Lybass,
deeply engrossed in his task, was
probably the outstanding performer
of the evening.

He handled the following bonus
question single-handedly: “All of the
following 20th Century novels de-
rive their titles from other literary
works. Identify the source of the

3 Professors

Doing Research

Three Washington and Lee pro-
fessors are studying or doing re-
search on leave of absence during
the 1961-1962 school session.

Dr. Jenks, a professor in the
history department, is doing research
in Vienna this year to gather mater-
ial for another book. He has re-
ceived a Social Science Research
Council Grant to write on the con-
dition of Austrian politics around
1910. Dr. Jenks is a specialist in
the field of Austrian history. In 1950
his The Austrian Electorial Reform
of 1907 was published by the Co-
lumbia University Press. More re-
cently his Vienna and the Young
Hitler was published by the same
press. This book describes the so-
cial and political conditions in Vien-
na just before and during the time
when the youthful Hitler was living
there and theorizes the effects of
this particular city on the mind and
character of Hitler.

Professor Robert R. Huntley is on
leave of absence for graduate study
under a fellowship at the Harvard
Law School. His classes are being
taught by visiting professor T. Mun-
ford Boyd of the University of Vir-
ginia Law School and by special
lecturer William O. Roberts, Jr., of
the Lexington Bar.

Mr. Brockman, instructor in ro-
mance languages, is studying in
anticipation of a Ph.D. at the Uni-
versity of Columbia. He is on a
Danforth Teachers Study Grant.

 

On location in Dr. Ed Hamer’s
back yard they shot a series of
scenes which will be used as part
of the upcoming production of Boy
Meets Girl.

Featured in the three-minute pre-
view type trailer, which will open
the second act of the play, are Bruce
Whelihan as Larry Toms, a great
western star, and Tim Morton as
his sidekick.

The star of the film, however, is
Billy Roberts, four-month-old son
of the Friday R-t P editor, who
makes his acting debut as Happy,
unchallenged infant prodigy and
youngest star in Hollywood history.

Boy Meets Girl, now in the final
stages of rehearsal, concerns the
antics of two of Hollywood’s zan-
iest writers, played by Andy Leonard
and Jerry Gray. This pair spends
more time dreaming up practical
jokes to make life miserable for
their producer, played by Phil Booth,
than writing.

The play relates the story of one
of their funniest gags—making a
star of the infant son of a studio
waitress. Susie Dunnell, wife of
Troubadour president John Dunnell,
will appear as the lucky mother.

Some of the play’s most hysteri-
cal and chaotic scenes occur when
this enterprise backfires on the
writers, and they have to scramble
to save their jobs.

Other major roles will be filled
by Steve Colvin as Rodney Bevan,
a young Englishman trying to break
into pictures; Ron Alenstein as a
typically greedy actor’s agent; and
Scott Iacone as a hack composer
of background music.

Boy Meets Girl will open the cur-
rent Troub season on Tuesday, Oct-
tober 31st with a run of four nights.

Tickets for Boy Meets Girl can
be obtained from any Troubadour
member.

 

titles.” The first was Steinbeck’s
In Dubious Battle; answer, Milton’s
Paradise Lost. Next Hemingway’s
The Sun Also Rises; from the Bible
(Tom said Ecclesiasties). Fitzgerald’s
Tender is the Night; Keats’ “Ode to
a Nightingale.” Faulkner’s The
Sound and the Fury; McBeth. Hux-
ley’s Brave New World; from The
Tempest.

A question in a lighter vein which
the boys were unable to handle was
as follows: “Name the contemporary
musician whose name describes what
would happen if you put a beer mug
on a hot stove.” Leonard Bern-
stein, of course.

Individual Scores

The following rundown will give
an indication of the performance of
the individual boys. The first num-
ber following a name is the number
of questions that he answered cor-
rectly and was first with the answer,
the second refers to the number of
questions correctly answered. Ly-
bass, 50, 55; Lowry, 45,51; Camp-
bell, 42,55; Anderson, 42,47; McNabb,
31, 45, Craven, 28, 42; Brown, 27,
44; and Marrow, 20, 42.

The team of four and the two al-
ternates will be decided upon by
Monday by Mr. Parsons on the basis
of extensive testing and individual
response during the radio show.
These six delegates to the CBS
program will be announced in the
Ring-tum Phi on Tuesday of next
week.

Debating Frat
Will Initiate
11 Members

More than 65 Persons from col-
leges around the state will partici-
pate in the initiation of the newly
formed Washington and Lee chapter
of Tau Kappa Alpha here Friday.

The honorary forensic and debate
fraternity will initiate 11 persons as
charter members. The six students
from the undergraduate school are:
William P. Boardman, Richard Kel-
ly, Al Eckes, Richard McEnally,
William Noell and John Harcourt.

Of the five receiving honorary
membership, three graduated last
year from the undergraduate school.
They are William Bice, George Bird-
song and Pete Straub.

The two members of the faculty
receiving membership are Dr. A.
Ross Borden, acting chairman of
the English Department, and Wil-
liam W. Chaffin, head of forensic
activities at W&L and sponsor of
the new chapter.

The day’s activities will include
18 rounds of discussion and six
rounds of debate, to be held between
2-4:45 p.m. Members of W&L,
Bridgewater, VMI, Richmond and
Roanoke Colleges will participate. .

Following this a panel composed
of W&L faculty members will dis-
cuss the national debate question,
“Resolved that labor unions will be
subject to the jurisdiction of anti-
trust legislation.” Participating in
the discussion will be Dr. C. F.
Phillips, Jr., Dr. E. C. Griffith, Prof.
J. M. Gunn, Jr., Dr. Milton Colvin
and Prof. C. V. Laughlin.

Earlier this month, the student
Executive Committee of the UCA
voted—subject to the approval of
the Faculty Committee on Christian
Work— to invite the controversial
Negro minister to lead a UCA sem-
inar on “Christian Ethics and Non-
Violent Protest in Race Relations.”

The faculty committee discussed
the issue last week and voted to
recommend to President Cole and
the Board of Trustees that the
student group be allowed to in-
vite Dr. King to lead the seminar.

The board gave us an answer,
but no excuse,” Dr. Louis Hodges,
faculty advisor for the UCA, said
about the refusal.

In discussing the matter, Dr.
Hodges told a reporter, “I have two
things I want to say. First, this
action has been taken, and the issue
of inviting Dr. King under the aus-
pices of the UCA is closed.

“Second, and this is a personal
opinion, I stand with the faculty
committee and their recommenda-
tion. I feel that Dr. King should be
invited to this campus.”

Last year Dr. King appeared at
the University of Virginia, and this
spring at the University of Cali-
fornia—where he was reportedly
properly received.

Dr. King first came to prominence
several years ago for his part in
school integration and the “passive
resistance” program. More recently
he has been active as a leader in
the Negro sit-ins and freedom riders
movements in the South. Several at-
tempts have been made on his life.

Speaking about Dr. King, Dr.
Hodges said, “he is a man most
qualified to speak on Christian
ethics and non-violence. He knows
not only the theory of integration,
but the application of this theory,
also.

“He is quiet in lecture, and ex-

“Operation Abolition” Inspires Crowd

“Operation Abolition” was pre-
sented at Washington and Lee Tues-
day night before an audience of
over 200 and provoked an expected
hail of criticism and controversy.

Sponsored by the Conservative
Society of W&L, the film was shown

in duPont Hall jammed 25 minutes
prior to flick time. The auditorium
seats only about 120 persons.

The showing provoked laughter,
applause, fiery sarcastic comment,
and a bet of a fifth of bourbon.
Intense interest was exhibited by

ter the film for a prolonged question
and answer period, with former
House investigator Robert Goldsboro
the target.

Goldsboro, well qualified for com-
ment on the story because of his
connection with the House Com-
mittee on Un-American Affairs, sub-
ject of the film, was in warm water
several times during this period.
The questions asked were searching
and feeling was intense.

The 28-minute documentary
movie, taken by television cameras,
evoke laughter and applause itself.
Most of the laughter came at the
expense of so-called Communist
leaders of the filmed riots.

Most of the questions asked from
the floor after the film concerned
distortions and discrepancies in the
story. Senior Ron Stein drew ap-
plause when he pointed out the
fact that the film classes all dem-
onstrators against the Committee as
either Communists or dupes. Hun-
dreds of students which protested
fell into neither of these categories.

A bet of a fifth of bourbon was
proposed to Goldsboro by Dr. Milton
Colvin, who denied a statement made
by both the film and Goldsboro.
Colvin wanted to check the law li-
brary to prove his point, but Golds-
boro pleaded a long drive ahead of
him and declined the offer.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

We Protest!

The University Board of Trustees has refused the Univer-
sity Christian Association’s request that Dr. Martin Luther
King be invited to participate in a UCA-sponsored seminar
here on “Christian Ethics and Non-Violent Protest in Race
Relations.”

The editors of the Friday Ring-tum Phi consider the Board’s
action inexcusable, and sincerely protest the decision.

Dr. King is symbolic of a moral, social and economic prob-
lem of the utmost significance. As such, his views are paticularly
relevant to the study of that problem.

By its refusal to let Dr. King appear, the Board of Trustees
has seriously violated the rights of the student body of this
University—a University supposedly dedicated to the spirit of
free inquiry.

Appalled by the Board’s action, we call upon the faculty
and the student body to voice their opinions.

 

Why Not? |

Every year someone or another comes out in favor of |
abolishing the Assimilation Committee. This year Protest did, |
but in a rather weak manner, as if to say that there really wasn’t
much hope.

Well, we think there ought to be. We’re not at all sure
that the Assimilation Committee deserves to be continued.

In the first place, if a student is forced to dress better than
he normally would, any prestige we gain from our appearance
here is false. Why try to please visitors to the campus by setting
up a committee to make sure everyone looks nice? If so, why
not call the committee the “Make us all look like Nice Little
Boys Committee”?

We do think that most students respect the tradition of
conventional dress and would wear coats and ties to class and on
other appropriate occasions. We know some of them wouldn’t.
They would stick out like a sore thumb and no doubt damage
our reputation. But if there were no enforcement and a man’s
clothing were left to his own discretion, we think that it could
be a respected tradition and not just another rule.

The Assimilation Committee does perform a useful func-
tion in enforcing freshman assimilation regulations. Like all
freshman rules, these are largely artificial and have to be en-
forced. But the enforcement is too much a legal matter, too
much a question of law and order.

We would like to see every upperclassman have the right

to mete out mild punishments in the forms of pushups or some
other beneficial exercises—physical or intellectual—for failure
to wear one’s beanie. Perhaps a committee could be set up to
handle flagrant violators and to oversee the enforcement of
the rules.

This pushup business smacks, of course, too much of the
collegiate dark ages 10 or 15 years ago, when every student
cared about his university or fraternity and took it as his highest
duty to uphold her honor, even if violence were necessary. The
Assimilation Committee long ago took that out of our hands.
We would like to see it put back on a man-to-man basis.

We're tired of matters which are everybody’s business
being put into the hands of a committee. What becomes a
committee’s business ceases to be everybody’s.

Washington and Lee is neither too big nor too heterogenous
to put these matters in the hands of the individual student. Why
doesn’t someone have the courage to stand up and push
through a constitutional amendment to put Assimilation where
it belongs?

Why doesn’t someone stand up and say “‘T’ll see to it that
those d--- freshmen wear their d--- beanies, and I think it’s my
own business what I wear.”

Conservative Chaos

When the Conservative Society was formed last year,
we were skeptical, but interested. The membership list was
impressive, and we were willing to listen. Above all, we hoped
that the Society would attempt to state clearly the principles of
Conservatism, showing that these principles could be practically
applied to national government.

Well, so far, the Society has made no such attempt. This
was especially apparent in last Tuesday’s showing of Operation
Abolition. This film was pure propaganda, designed to arouse
indignation, and did not represent a careful analysis of Com-
munist methods. It belonged to the same genre as the sentation-
alized newsreels of the Montgomery race riots, and was an in-
sult to the intelligence of the duPont Hall audience.

And yet the Society, or at least the Society’s speaker, chose
to defend the film. Are we to assume that this is the way in
which Conservatism intends to inform the public of their prin-
ciples? If so, it appears that the Conservatives, like the Com-
munists, are trying to “dupe”? unwary students.

HUAC Enigma Needs Evaluation
From ‘Right’ And ‘Left’ Extremes

By JOHN PAUL

Our nation is one wherein the
higher political ideals of man have
gained a measure of fulfillment. Our
heritage is that of a maximum of
individual freedom in an ordered
society. It is for this partially achiev-
ed vision of a land insuring free-
dom and justice to all that Amer-
ica should hope to be remembered.

In an age of tension it is only
natural that what freedoms do exist
in America should be guarded, and
with zeal, by those who have the
wisdom to see the incredible value
of our attainment.

Tuesday night, during the discus-
sion following the showing of the
film “Operation Abolition” we wit-
nessed a display of conflicting minds.
Yet, upon consideration, it would
seem that these minds have a com-
mon meeting point: their motivation.
For apparently they have mutually
been urged to their respective po-
sitions by an earnest desire to pre-
serve that fragile balance which is
the American political achievement.

Some men (shall we refer to them
as the “Right’?) have chosen to
place emphasis upon the hostility
and aggression of our political en-
emies, the danger of subversion, and
the necessity of sacrificing certain of
our political ideals in order to pre-
serve the general welfare. These
men of the “Right” see investigat-
ing committees as a necessary tool
for the preservation of the repub-
lic.

Others (and for simplicity of term-
inology let us refer to them as the
“Left”) have seen investigating com-
mittees of the nature of HUAC as
endangering freedom of expression
and association as witch hunts
and would have them abolished.

I invite these two groups to re-
consider. I wish to ask for a return
to the common meeting ground in
order that constructive approaches
may be launched.

I feel it incumbent upon me, as an
individual, to point out to the
“Right” that the HUAC represents
a departure from our traditional
concept of law—that a man charged
with a crime should be given a fair
trial in a court of law. A man should

not be forced to face a legislative
committee to answer for his beliefs
where such appearance may ex-
pose him to sanctions in the nature
of economic pressure or public scorn
due in part to intimation, smear,
or innuendo. It is further empha-
sized that the powers granted to
such a committee should be consid-
ered emergency powers and_ that
adequate safeguards against abuse
should be provided.

Many individual Americans be-
lieve that in the case of HUAC the
abuse outweighs the constructive
accomplishments. “Operation Abo-
lition” may express a _ one-sided
point of view in giving the impres-
sion that since Communists oppose
HUAC, then all who oppose HUAC
are either Communists or dupes.
That the film might be so interpreted
is a danger which I call upon fair-
minded persons to consider.

I feel I should also admonish the
“Left” that we are facing at this

 

time a continuing threat of sub-
version and deception by those in-
imical to our cherished political in-
stituitons. The record of Communism
in America is sufficient to remind
us of this threat. Therefore, to fail
to recognize the usefulness of such
an invetigating committee is per-
haps to disregard some unpleasant
facts. It is the value of an investi-
gating committee, as a legislative
device to insure freedom through
law, that the “Left” must appreciate.
Too often the “Left” sees the threat
but not the value.

In summary, abolition of the
Committee is not my answer. I call
for a positive and responsible eval-
uation of the Committee and for
the enactment of corrective safe-
guards. This undertaking to be done
to the end that our system may
continue to flourish; that there be a
conservation of our traditional right;
and that freedom and justice under
law may be liberally dispersed
throughout our land.

 

 

A Brief But Important Discourse
On Crumbling Campus Traditions

By STEVE HENRY

The faculty has seen fit to ban the
time-honored group, the Hot-Nuts,
from our fair campus.

Viewed in retrospect, its action
seems both belated and necessary.
The Hot-Nuts are gross, crude, un-
refined, and generally out-of-taste.
In other words, they are perfectly
in keeping with Washington and Lee
party traditions.

As a matter of fact, the Hot-Nuts
are one of our greatest traditions,
ranking right up there with the
speaking tradition, conventional
dress, and the good old apple barrel.

The average man on the street,
however casually he might be ac-
quainted with the academic excel-
lence of our university, is fully
aware of the fact that Washington
and Lee is “where that nifty com-
bo plays—the one with all the nasty
lines.”

When one considers thiis pertinent
fact, the faculty’s action seems al-
most revolutionary. After all, if
breaking a tradition here is almost
a cardinal sin, what is the penalty
for abolishing one?

What’s the faculty trying to do,
anyway? Ruin our good name on
the Atlantic seaboard? Heaven for-
bid.

We can still remember the words
of that venerable guardian of W&L
traditions, who cried out for the
world to hear that “as long as there’s
a Washington and Lee, they’ll never
get rid of the Nuts.”

What is a person to think? The
foundations of the schools are
crumbling before us.

The next thing you know, they’ll
do away with something that really
means something around here. Like

the speaking tradition or required |

assemblies. Once again, heaven for-

bid.

 

But back to the Nuts.

We would like to propose a short
psychological exercise for those of
you who are not especially fond of
this group.

1. Free yourself from all worldly
matters. Be natural. Return entire-
ly to the primitive. Only then can
you appreciate what the Nuts are
trying to do.

2. Repeat over and over to your-
self, “The Nuts are not any grosser
or cruder than I am. I use the same
words every day, and I have not
been banned (yet, anyway).

3 Who am I to cast judgment on
a group of hard-working, industrious
gentlemen who are striving to make
a living the best way they know
how?

SOCCER ACTION IN yesterday’s game between Washington and Lee and

Duke University. Nationally ranked Duke won 11-2 against an inexperi-

enced General squad, which was hurt by poor defense and sluggish offense.
Outstanding for W&L was freshman Gil Slingerland.

 

Generals Risk Streak,
Face Johns Hopkins

Undefeated Washington and Lee meets undefeated Johns
Hopkins in Baltimore Saturday, and both teams think they
have a score to settle with the other one.

The Generals, with a 3-0 record for the current campaign,
want to get even for the 8-8 standoff in 1960 which put the only

 

blot on an otherwise unblemished
8-0-1 season mark.

The Blue Jays want to prove that
they should have beaten the Gen-
erals, if it hadn’t been for a goal-
line fumble on one occasion and a
touchdown-killing penalty on an-
other.

Records

W&L is fresh from a 43-0 conquest
of Randolph-Macon, while the Jays
matched the Generals’ 350 yards
in total offense but nevertheless
were battled to a scoreless standstill
at Haverford.

So far, Saturday’s opponents have
met one common foe, Franklin and
Marshall. Johns Hopkins beat the
Diplomats, 13-0, while the Generals
bumped F&M a week later, 40-0.
But W&L Coach Lee McLaughlin
doesn’t take much stock in compara-
tive scores, for the situation was
generally the same in 1960 when it
was 12-6 Hopkins and 38-8 W&L
over the F&M team. The Jays also
have beaten Ursinus, 13-8.

Assistant Coach Boyd Williams,
who has scouted Hopkins twice for
W&L adds, “There’s no doubt in
my mind but what Johns Hopkins is
the finest team we’ve seen since we
played them last year.”

The Jays have Henry Ciccarone at
tailback and Phil Sutley at fullback,
and the Generals recall these boys
as the chief agents in an attack
that rocked W&L on its heels for
most of the game last year.

Ciccarone is a fine passer, com-
pleting 13 of 25 passes in the rain
against Haverford, While Sutley is

a workhorse, carrying the ball 32
times for nearly 100 yards against
the Fords.

“We learned a valuable lesson
last year,’ recalls McLaughlin. “I
hope we’ll be able to tackle bet-
ter this time. That Sutley makes
you look bad if you don’t get him
low and hard.”

McLaughlin allowed that he
didn’t think the W&L squad would
have any trouble “getting up” for
the Johns Hopkins game. It will be
the third time that McLaughlin’s
team have met the Jays, and the
Generals have yet to win. In 1957,
it was 13-12 for Johns Hopkins.

Offense Bright

After sputtering in the opening
game, the Generals’ offense has
been effective enough to please Mc-
Laughlin in the past two weeks.
Juniors Tommy Keesee and Charley
Gummey, promoted from the second
to the first units after the 7-6 win
over Hampden-Sydney, have re-
sponded admirably to new respon-
sibilities.

Gummey has scored three touch-
downs and three conversion runs
while contributing 115 yards rush-
ing at 4.1 yards a carry. Keesee has
no points, but he’s right behind
Gummey with 108 yards rushing at
4.9 yards a try.

The Generals’ Little All-Ameri-
can linebacker, Terry Fohs, con-
tinues to spark a W&L defense that

Tennis, Golf
Playoffs Set

By HOWIE KORMAN

With the tennis and golf seasons
completed, the I-M football program
started October 17. PiKA, Beta, and
Phi Psi all shut out their opponents.

Defending champion PiKA scored
two touchdowns in the first half to
hand Phi Gam a 13-0 setback.
Quarterback Nicky Smith faded
back early in the first period and
threw Cy Painter a 40-yard toss for
the initial TD. Just before the half-
time, Smith spotted his right half-
beck alone in the end zone and hit
him with a perfect 30-yard pass to
meke the score 13-0.

Peced by the signal calling of Ray
Gordon, the Betas easily downed
the Sigma Nu’s, 19-0. Late in the
second quarter Gordon put his team-
mates into the lead as he scored
on a six yard run around right end.
A short pass from Gordon to his
left end made the score board read
13-0 at the half. In the final period,
quarterback Gordon intercepted a
stray Sigma Nu pass and raced for
the final touchdown of the day.

In the other contest on Tuesday,
Phi Kap completely overran the
Lambda Chi’s, 26-0. Scoring in every
period, the victors showed strength
on both offense and defense.

On October 18, three more games
were played, with the Delts winning
by forfeit, Phi Psi by 21-0, and the
representatives from the law school
playing KA to a draw.

Leading Phi Psi to victory over
Kappa Sig was freshman speedster
Dick Kreitler. Kreitler scored first
on a long run, and then was on the
receiving end of a TD pass thrown
by Lou Mongeau. Mongeau also hit
Dave Britt with a pass for the final
score of the game.

In the law-KA encounter each
team was able to gain enough yard-
age for five first downs; but neither
was able to cross the goal line.

Tennis

The I-M tennis schedule was co-
pleted during the week with only
two of the four league champions
decided.

In League A the netters from
PiKA ended the season with a per-
fect record by downing Lambda
Chi. The losers captured second
place with two wins in four matches.

A protest concerning the Oc-
tober 12 match between Phi Kap
and SAE is holding up the final
standings in Division B. To date
these houses have identical 2-1
records.

The decision that will be handed
down by the I-M board will break
the tie and decide first place.

Frosh Set For
AMA Game
This Afternoon

After two bruising losses, Wash-
ington and Lee’s freshman football
team steps into its own “class of
competition” Friday.

The Baby Generals meet Augusta
Military Academy at 3:15 p.m. on
W&L’s Wilson Field.

Augusta brings a 1-1-1 record
and a 200-pound line to Lexington,
but freshman coach Dana Swan
thinks his Baby Generals can stay
with the larger invaders.

“We had hoped to platoon against
Augusta, but we have nine first
stringers out with injuries. Now
we'll have to counter their size with
conditioning instead of depth.”

But the injury picture isn’t quite
as bleak as it might appear. Fullback
Bruce Kurtz and guard Brooks
Brown are both returning to duty
and a newcomer, 200-pound guard
Louis Rex, adds strength in the line.

“The return of Kerts and Brown
takes some of the sting out of our
injuries, but most of our boys will
have to play both offense and de-
fense,’ Swan emphasized. “We had
hoped to keep a fresh unit in the
game at all times against Augusta.”

During the week’s layoff since
W&L’s 33-0 loss to Ferrum Junior
College, Swan has corrected two of
the Baby Generals’ worst faults.

“Ferrum beat us on traps. Our
guards hadn’t been educated but
they’ll never get trapped again. We
worked hard on the trap last week
and we think our guards can defense
it very well now.”

The other problem—offensive
blocking—is also “100 per cent im-
proved.”

“We were opening the holes,”
Swan explained, “but we weren’t
keeping them open. Now we’re stay-
ing with our blocks.”

The Baby Generals stand 0-2 for
their seven-game schedule.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Basketball

Practice

Gets Underway Here

By STEVE HENRY

Pre-season basketball practice at Washington and Lee got
underway this week, with only four lettermen returning from
last year’s squad that managed a 7-11 overall record, including
a stunning upset over the University of Virginia.

With only two men over 672” available for action, W&L

head coach Bob McHenry faces a*

problem to which he’s grown ac-
customed—how to play winning col-
lege basketball without adequate
height.

As if that weren’t enough, he’s
also hurting for experience.

Not one of the top ten men on
last year’s edition were seniors, giv-
ing every indication that this year
McHenry would be working with a
reasonably experienced ball club.

But injuries, flunk-outs, and aca-
demic deficiencies have left Mc-
Henry holding the bag.

Ide, Fauber

Only Captain Bip Fauber and
Bill Ide return from last year’s start-
ing five.

Fauber, who at 6’2” could be the
best basketball player his size in
Virginia, is a sure starter at the
forward position.

Ide, a guard last year, has been
moved into a forward slot opposite
Fauber.

At the guards, McHenry is count-
ing on a group of talented trans-
fers, headed by Jon and Tom Su-
pac, a set of 61” twins who moved
over to W&L from William and
Mary.

Don Wallis, a transfer from the
University of Pennsylvania, is an-
other backcourter for whom Mc-
Henry has high hopes this year.

Pivot

But the Generals will be weakest
at the center position, and nobody
knows it better than McHenry.

“We just don’t have a pivot man.

 

 

Until then, McHenry will either
have to find a pivot man or make
one.

He’s got a prime candidate in
64” Howard Martin, a sophomore
who moves up from Coach Joe
Lyles’ freshman team.

Martin, a good shooter, could
solve McHenry’s problem at the
center position, but only if he grows
more aggressive.

“He’s not aggressive enough,” says
McHenry. “They’d kill him on the
boards.”

Two freshman _ prospects—6’4”
John Marshall and 65” Gene
Pearce—could make the grade, but
both lack the experience under the
boards needed for college ball.

Four other freshmen are also
working out with the General var-
sity, including George Madison,
Richard Brown, Louie Paterno, and
Carol Klinglehoffer.

Lettermen

In addition to Ide and Fauber,
two other lettermen are back from
last year. They are Bill Smith and
Dave Grogan, both of whom saw
heavy action during the late season.

Grogan came up with several key
baskets in the W&L win over Ran-
dolph-Macon and UVa, and Smith
did more than an adequate job on
defense.

Smith may even get moved into
the pivot this year, even though he
stands only 6’2”. Grogan is 6’1”.

Mozart Opera
Is Scheduled
For Lexington

Mozart’s comic opera, Cosi Fan
Tutte, will be presented in English
translation by the Turnau Opera
Players at 8:15 p.m. Wednesday in
Waddell School in Lexington.

The performance by the young
American singing group signals the
opening of the 1961-62 Rockbridge
Concert-Theater Series.

The Series is presently conducting
a membership drive, to continue
through this weekend. Tickets may
be purchased at White’s Furniture
and Music Store or from Dr. Ley-
burn. Student season tickets are
$7.00.

Cosi Fan Tutte concerns two sis-
ters, their respective lovers, a bit-
ter old bachelor, and a designing old
maid. The action takes place in the
Naples of the 1790’s, and is filled
with humorous twists and comic
complications.

The two lovers are talked into
putting their sweethearts to the test
by the old bachelor, who says that
all women are fickle. They disguise
themselves as Albanian officers and
visit the two sisters, succeeding to
their dismay in making some head-
way with each others’ girls.

After a treasurehouse of compli-
cations and misunderstandings arise,
everything is solved and all “live
happily ever after.”

Hot Nuts Are Defended

As Venerable Tradition
(Continued from page 2)

musical form has been appreciated
at first. The sound of the Nuts may
be the sound of a generation—a
sound full of great significance. Let
us not close our minds to the pos-
sibility that someday we might be
proud to say that “Washington and
Lee was the only school broad-
minded enough to give full rein to
the Hot Nuts’ new Musical forms.”
5. Consider briefly the fundamen-
tal problem: How did the speakers
get in the windows in the first
place. It’s a safe bet that the Nuts
didn’t give two hoots about per-
forming for the entire city of Lex-
ington.
Until you have adjusted your
mind to the above way of thinking,
you are probably incapable of cast-
ing a valid judgment on the Nuts.
So we would humbly ask you to
try the liberal way. It is the only
way for our school to survive.
Besides, without the Nuts, what
is there going to be to talk about
at home?

Apathy And Politics
Were Main Topics

At Editors’ Meeting

By ROY GOODWIN
Editor-in-Chief

“...I’ve never seen or talked to a Southerner. I want to hear
your views on the integration problem. Why do you people from the
South discriminate against the Negro?”

“If I were in Europe and I wanted to get away from the problems
of the world, I would go to a convent. If I were in America and I
wanted to get away from the problems of the world, I would go to
the American college campus....”

Such statements as the above are characteristic of the topics dis-
cussed at a newspaper editors’ conference held this past weekend
at Hamilton College in Clinton, N. Y.

Attending the conference were editors of college newspapers
located in the East and members of the United Nations Foreign Press
Corps. The theme of the two-day event was “Assignment: The Amer-
ican Student.”

Thirty colleges and universities were represented at the meeting,
and 32 foreign correspondents from 20 countries flew to the Ham-
ilton campus from the United Nations.

Bill Roberts, the Friday Edition’s editor, and I had the oportunity
to attend this conference, and I can say, for my part, that it proved
most interesting.

Since we were the only two delegates from the South, we were
prime targets for questions concerning segregation that came from
the student editors.

Student Apathy Is Main Question

The foreign correspondents wanted to get information on the
American college student, and the main question that they posed
concerned apathy and national politics.

A public symposium was held one evening on the subject and the
topic was “The Student: Observer or Participant in a Revolutionary
World.” Editor Roberts served on this ten-man panel, five panel
members being students and five being foreign correspondents. Mod-
erator of this discussion was John B. Oakes, editorial page editor of
the New York Times.

Is Rioting the Answer?

Reasoning that much of American student’s apathy could be
traced to a dormant college press, it seemed to be a good number of
the students’ opinion that the “riot” was an answer to the apathy
problem.

“One way for the American student to be a direct participant
in America political affairs is to riot,” said one editor.

George N. Fenin, a correspondent from Italy, said that he thought
the student should definitely be a participant in political affairs.

One of the Polish reporters added that everybody should be in-
volved in world affairs. He said that a riot is an abnormal way of
expression. “Something is at the boiling point,” he continued, “the
student should not have to wait for this point.”

Indian Correspondent Easwar Sagar said that the student must
be involved politically. “No student,” he said, “can be a truly edu-
cated man and remain politically passive.”

When asked why he thought the American student tended to be
unconcerned with the world’s affairs, Sagar added that Americans are
“too satisfied.”

Speaking of recent student riots in India, Sagar said that the
events of the modern world concern his country directly. Perhaps,
he said, because you won your independence many years ago you feel
that there is no need for your active participation. “This feeling is
wrong,” he said, “and should be changed.”

European Convent and American Campus Compared

Denouncing the colleges in America for no active participation,
Miss Marcelle Hitschmann of Parkistan said that “if I wanted to get
away from it all in Europe I would go to a convent. If I wanted to get
away from it in America,” she continued, “I would go to the college
campus.”

Many opinions as to how to avoid and rid American colleges of
this political apathy were discussed. Some of the panalists urged the
riots, and such measures as the sending of a “freedom rider” into
the South.

Other degelates expressed the thought that the answer could be
found in getting the student to align himself with campus political
clubs. Many students expressed the opinion that political clubs on
their campuses were kept from being too active by university trustees
who didn’t want to see their colleges become the objects of national
publicity due to rioting, etc.

It was further expressed that these clubs’ infiuence is being held
down because various colleges don’t want to become known as being
“political” colleges representing this philosophy or that political idea.

Confronted with the idea that the trustees may try and suppress
college publications, many editors and correspondents urged delegates
to “stick their necks out.”

Segregation and Intergration Discussed

When asked what the major theme of Soviet propaganda was, the
correspondents nearly all expressed the view that American segrega-
tion was the content.

Since the above may be true, Bill and I were deluged with ques-
tions as to why the South had not yet integrated all her schools.

“... I’ve never seen or talked to a Southerner. I want to know why
you people discriminate against the Negro when it hurts us abroad
so,” was one female delegate’s query of me.

Many of the editors asked me why integration couldn’t be put
into effect immediately.

Many students thought that the South should be forced to inte-
grate its schools as soon as possible.

Speaking for myself, I can say that after hearing our views, I
hope that some of them can now see our point about this problem.
Both Bill and I urged them to give the South time to work out this
problem.

“You can’t change a sociological problem overnight,” one delegate
was told.

Became Objects of Ridicule

One delegate thought that she would be clever and would scorn
me for being a Southerner.

“How y'all from the South tonite, honey chile?” she directed at
me in her most sarcastic tones.

Since Bill and I both represent what I would call a “conservative”
point of view, many of the questions on the panels were directed
specifically at us.

When Bill was a member of the panel discussion directed by Mr.
Oakes of the Times, several students seemed to realize that he was in

Magazine To Feature
W&L Athletic Policy

BY JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Managing Editor

Washington and Lee, for many years a bad word in col-
lege athletic circles, is moving back into the national spotlight.
Not since 1951 when the Generals traveled to the Gator

Bowl, has W&L received any

scorn. *

What has brought Washington and
Lee, a school which plays only ama-
teur football, into the national spot-
light again?

Many things, including 14 straight
games without a loss; but most of
all—an amateur athletic policy that
really works and that receives the
full support of the student body,
faculty, and alumni.

Walter Bingham, an associate
editor of Sports Mlustrated, will
visit the W&L campus this Thurs-
day, Friday, and Saturday to do
a feature story of the success of
amateur athletics at W&L and
the vigorous support of the pro-
gram.

This article will be an outgrowth
of an article about Johns Hopkins’
amateur football program which ap-
peared in Sports Illustrated last
year.

That article implied that while
amateur football had done well at
Johns Hopkins, there was no support

sort of national notice except

 

implied that an amateur athletic pro-
gram could not have strong sup-
port anywhere.

Sports Illustrated was immediately
beseiged with a flow of letters from
other schools with amateur athletic
programs, W&L being one, stating
tha there could be support and en-
thusiasm behind amateur athletics.

The editors of Sports Illustrated
decided to present the “other side”
of amateur athletics and chose
Washington and Lee as the typical
example.

When Washington and Lee’s Board
of Trustees decided to abolish sub-
sidized athletics, they drew much
criticism from students, alumni, and
friends.

It was a long, hard climb, but
Washington and Lee’s athletic pro-
gram has finally reached the sum-
mit. Amateur athletics are a success.

The football story is one of riches
to rags to riches, from the 1950 Gator
Bowl team to the dismal teams of
1955-57 to the present undefeated

undefeated at the end of its fifth
appearance, it retires. On each pro-
gram the winner receives a $1,500
scholarship grant and the loser, a
$500 grant.

Team Members

The team represents all three of
the university’s upper classes. Lybass
is a sophomore from Jacksonville,
Florida; Lowry, from Hobbs, New
Mexico, and Campbell, from St.
Petersburg, Florida, are both jun-
iors; and Anderson, from Startex,
South Carolina, is a senior. All four
are non-fraternity men.

Both alternates, McNab and Craven
are seniors. McNab, a Lambda Chi, is
from Cranford, New Jersey; and
Craven, a Sigma Nu, is from Con-
cord, North Carolina.

Training

Intensive training and coaching,
especially on the use of the buzzers
for answering questions, will be-
gin immediately.

“It is very necessary that the
team members hit the buzzer
quickly and let you know they’ve
hit it,’ Parsons said. “On the radio
show they still tended to raise
their hands.”

Parsons has installed buzzers in
his outer office in Washington Hall
to train the team.

Huddling to answer the bonus
questions is another phase of the
game the team will work on inten-
sively.

“When Pomona has a bonus ques-
tion all the team members imme-
diately turn toward the captain and
whisper the answer. He then gives
his approval and they answer. All
this is done very quickly. This is
the technique we want to use,”
Parsons emphasized.

Outside Help

W&L’s team of varsity scholars
will receive aid in their study from
several sources.

One is very unusual. Dr. Charles
F. Phillips, Sr., the president of
Bates College, which participated
on the Quiz Bowl successfully last
year, was recently in Lexington
and gave his son Dr. Charles F.
Phillips, Jr., an assistant professor
of economics at W&L, some tips for
the Quiz Bow! team. Professor Phil-
lips will assist Parsons in coaching
W&L’s team.

Banning Dr. King Violates Two University Principles

In refusing the University Christian Association’s re-
quest to have Dr. Martin Luther King speak, The Board of
Trustees has violated two fundamental principles of this
school.

The Washington and Lee Catalogue in defining the as-
pirations of the University states: ‘This University, subject
to no type of political control whatever, is none the less dedi-
cated to the democratic form... of social organization; to
the ancient freedoms and particularly to the liberty of the
mind with its attendant right of inquiry.’’ The catalogue con-
tinues, “The other enduring adherence of this University
is declared in the first by-law of its official regulations, first
in importance, as well as in time, which affirms that while
sectarian domination in this school is prohibited, ‘the obliga-
tion to inculcate the Christian ideal is hereby acknow-
ledged’.”

If the Board had adhered to the “‘principles” of the Uni-
versity, Dr. Martin Luther King would be allowed to appear
and to speak on this campus. Instead, the request to have him
lead a seminar sponsored by the UCA has been denied,
without reason.

Earlier this month the student Executive Committee of
the UCA voted, subject to the approval of the Faculty
Committee on Christian Work, to invite the controversial
Negro minister to the campus. Dr. King was to lead a semi-

The Faculty Committee discussed the question and voted
to recommend to President Cole and the Board of Trustees
that the student group be allowed to invite Dr. King to lead
the seminar.

This seminar was to be one of a series sponsored by the
UCA this year. The student organization had planned to
have a group of noted theologians to the campus in an at-
tempt to stimulate Christian ideas. The program was to take
the place of ‘Religious Emphasis Week.”’ The UCA felt that
such a program would develop a greater interest among the
student body. Quite obviously, their program has been given
a bad start by the Board of Trustees.

Washington and Lee has been praised as a “leading
liberal arts college.”” This is now highly inaccurate as evi-
denced by the actions of our Board of Trustees. How can
one obtain a liberal education when only one side of an argu-
ment is allowed to be presented? Our Board of Trustees has
denied us the privilege and the right of intellectual inquiry.

Admittedly Dr. King is the center of much controversy.
However, we have been allowed to hear the views of Colin
Wilson, Norman Thomas, and Barry Goldwater. Is Dr.
King any different?

We think that the decision to have Dr. King should not
have gone to the Board of Trustees in the first place. The
decision should have been left to the Faculty Committee and

precedent. Now, each controversial figure must seek the
Trustees’ approval before being allowed to speak on this
campus.

Dr. King is recognized as an authority in the field of
race relations. He holds a Doctor of Divinity degree from
Boston University. Furthermore, he has published several
books and numerous magazine articles on the subject. His
program of “passive resistance’ has spread throughout the
nation in the area of racial problems. Why is it that we are
denied the right to hear his views?

Is it because there is fear of bad conduct on the part of
the student body? Or, is it that the Board is afraid of the
unfavorable publicity that might be caused? In either case,
we feel that the fears are most unfounded. Washington and
Lee prides itself on the conduct of its gentlemen. Is there
any reason to believe that they will not continue to conduct
themselves in such a manner? Also we feel that the only pub-
licity that can arise now will be bad. With much being written
and said about racial problems and prejudice, Washington
and Lee could become a target of unfavorable criticism and
abuse. This is not what we want for our University.

We sincerely regret that the Board of Trustees has de-
nied us “freedom of inquiry.” It is our profound hope that
this action is not an indication of things to come.

Shamefully, Decision Stands;
King Ban Denies Free Inquiry

By ROBERT C. KETCHAM
Tuesday Columnist

It seems as though The Board
gave students a glimpse of their
back-side thinking in their decision
on Dr. King.

Through any other channel the
decision could at least be aired; but
no buck passing
here, “the issue of
inviting Dr. King
under the auspices

of the UCA is
closed.”
And a_ good

thing too, for who
would question
that body of men
which rises above
criticism. And
busy persons they
are for they vest
in themselves the right to control the
thinking on the campus as well as
the mere matter of hiring presidents
and paying teachers.

Lament, lament for the old days
before man created such boards,
when the students paid their own
professor and if he was not their
kind of apple he was either not paid
for or bruised.

The situation today in re-educa-
tion is so vast and spread out that
the former approach is hardly pos-
sible. However, the idea remains
and is good.

The great filtering process is a
poor way to come by an education.
Not that creating trustees to han-
dle and manage the university
presupposes such a process; but
simply that in our case a man-tank
has been substituted for a trust.

The preceding thought is not to
say that the How of The Decision
is most important, but rather the
Why. Why do these men feel that
banning a speaker is the proper ap-
approach? This raises the question,
where were these men educated?

 

Hollywood Turns Indian Dance
Into New Version Of Twist

By TOM GOAR
Tuesday Columnist

A few months ago, I had to write a report on the fertility
dances of the Karahooche Indians of Winnemucca, Nevada, for
my Cowboys and Indians course. So I settled down to do some

heavy research at the Lyric.

Sure enough, what should greet my*

eyes at the very beginning of the |

Oh blessed naivete if education is
for the purpose of force-feeding pre-
judice. Nor is Webster helpful in
this connection for he does not un-
derscore the importance of inquiry
in his definition of education.

Suffice it to say that if those
decision makers in toto or in part
attended Washington and Lee for
education I can only ask, what hap-
pened?

Even without analysis of personal
reasons in their reasoning the de-
cision cuts deep. Friday’s editorial
was succinctly correct when it stated

 

that “its refusal ...has seriously vio-
lated the rights of the student body
of this University—a University sup-
posedly dedicated to the spirit of
free inquiry.” The decision is a great
affront to each and every intellect
on this campus.

As students we are in this en-
vironment to understand, to learn,
and to evaluate. To ban the req-
quest for a speaker is no different
than to ban the reading of a cer-
tain book.

Does W&L Encourage Students To Think?

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist
This week’s problem for a column was originally something to
say about “Operation Abolition,” and all the goings-on that went on.

Friday’s little announcement seems to have changed that. “Oper-
ation Abolition” certainly affects us all, but we do have something
now that strikes a little closer to home.

   

Craven

I’ve always considered the Board of Trustees
to be the group that carries on the business of the
University. They have their meetings, and we
have ours, and sometimes we use the same build-
ings. But now it seems that I was mistaken. A
problem has come up which affects both the
Student Body and the Board of Trustees, and
both our spheres of influence.

It seems to me that the Board has lost some
of its dignity—sort of like the Statue of Liberty
dropping her torch. In making a decision which
contradicts the spirit of this University, and, I

believe, the spirit of the Board of Trustees,
both groups are made to look a little silly.

Their decision was for me a personal insult to my intelligence
and to the ability of the student body to exercise mature judgment
when faced with a current problem.

I realize that this has been said in other columns, and is being

For shoulder-rubbing with wide-
awake experts in the social sciences,
and a terrifyingly complete library,
LSE is the place to come.

But for any other Minks who
may wish to exchange the raven
of W&L for the beaver of LSE, I
can attest: It will be quite a
change.

From a tree-shaded campus in a
lazy Shenandoah town, you will
come to two sooty stone buildings
on a crooked little street, just a few
yards away from some of the busiest
thoroughfares in this frenetic city.

LSE was organized in 1895 by
Sidney and Beatrice Webb, a couple
of socialists who had been given a
large sum of money. The school
was finally placed on its present
site near Aldwych, in an already
congested area.

Subsequent additions, stuck on
the buildings in odd places, have
not been able to keep pace with

| the burgeoning student body. The

school is so crowded, in fact, that

 

I do not see how the leftists here
can retain a properly beneficent
outlook toward their fellow man.

Perhaps this is why a slight ma-
jority of the faculty professes con-
servatism.

Faculty members do a great deal
of publishing, but they admit freely
that many important works in so-
cial sciences are being done by
Americans. Incidentally, some of the
most learned and interesting lec-
turers have nothing more than bach-
elors’ degrees.

Each student is supposed to be
assigned to a faculty supervisor;
but, as the faculty is rather busy,
many first-year students are still
groping around on our own.
(School did not start until Oct. 4.)

All I do is go to 15 lectures and
seminars of my own choosing, and
read books suggested by the lectur-
ers. I do not really have to do any-
thing, of course, until July 1963,
when I must submit a bulky thesis
and pass an exam.

 

The school has very little dormi-
tory space, and most of us found
rooms on our own. I pay $13 a week
for a tiny place near Hyde Park. It
is far from luxurious, but if the
plumbing would just work proper-
ly I could be quite comfortable.

There are about 2700 regular stu-
dents here, perhaps 650 of who are
graduate students.

Almost 1000 of the regular stu-
dents are from abroad. Of these,
Asia sends about one-third, North
America sends one-fourth, and
Europe and Africa each send about
one-fifth.

Most of the African students have
adopted Western dress. The Indian
girls, however, still cling to their
silk saris, and vice-versa.

The school does have official
blazers, ties, and scarves, but few
students wear them. Indeed, there is
nothing approaching Conventional
Dress here, and a clean shirt and
clean shave makes one appear to be
a nonconformist.

said on the campus, and all over this page. I hope that the Board of

Trustees realize this.

We have trusted the Board of Trustees to carry on the busi-
ness of our University. We have thought that they have trusted us
to be affiliated with their University. Decisions of this sort destroy
this trust, and it destroys the opinion of the public where all the
agents of Washington and Lee are concerned.

Assimilation Committee Chairman Defends
Need For Committee and Conventional Dress

To the Editor:

In response to Friday’s editorial urging the abolition of
the Assimilation Committee, I feel obligated as chairman of
that organization and also as a proud member of this student
body to offer the case for the Assimilation Committee and for
the necessary perpetuation of its functions.

First, it takes a number of years*

for a university to become an ex-
ceptional institution and distinguish
itself among collegiate circles. The
traditions of conventional dress and
speaking first (along with, naturally,
the Honor System) have in no small
part contributed to Washington and
Lee’s recognition as a superior uni-
versity. Ours is an impressive uni-
versity, not only in its physical plant
and setting but also because of its
personnel. We have extraordinarily

capable professors who do an out- |

standing job of imparting knowledge.
Moreover, the administration seeks
to bring here men of above average
capabilities and to bring out their
best. The appearance we present to
visitors attests to our being “just
a little bit better”—would the editor
have this done away with? To do
away with the Assimilation Com-
mittee would virtually destroy in an
instant what has taken years to
build—Washington and Lee would
be reduced to the status of another
ordinary college.

Why is this so? Perhaps one
could attribute it to the idea of
“giving an inch and they'll take
a mile.” In the minds of many
including myself, the relaxation
of conventional dress would spread
quickly and with unpleasant ef-
fects. Ours would become a cam-

 

 

 

pus of “jeans and T-shirts.” The
author of Friday’s editorial would
question this. He says that one’s
fellow students would frown on
non-conventionality, and this mor-
al condemnation would replace the
assimilation Committee. This is
idealistic, and fine in theory, but
it won’t work. The simple fact that
one’s fellow students do not now
frown on the failure to wear a tie
or socks attests to my point—why
should this change without an As-
similation Committee?

The editor criticizes the Assimila-

| tion Committee for doing a lax job

as does the editor of Protest. Need
I remind these men that assimilation
is the job of the entire student body
(if they are proud enough of their
university) and not solely the job
of the thirteen men on the Assimi-
lation Committee? I can truthfully
say that there has been very little
help given to the Committee by the
student body in general and these
two men in particular. Yet, we are
the ones held to account. Can the
Executive Committee be in all places
at all times to observe infractions of
the Honor System? Of course not.
Yet the Assimilation Committee
must notice all violations of conven-
tional dress.

Untouchables Romp 38-6 For
Fourth Victory In 1961 Season

   

 

IGENERAL COMMENT,

BY DON WALLIS
Assistant Sports Editor

One might reasonably excuse W&L football coach Lee McLaugh-
lin for feeling somewhat optimistic, even self-satisfied, over the
present state of his General gridiron system.

After all, coach Mac and his 45-Star Generals haven’t tasted de-
feat during the last two seasons and this year’s squad has crushed
its last three opponents by an average margin of 40-2 (40-0, 43-0,
38-6) and he has no personnel problems, with 45 players capable of
being used at any time during the game.

But coach Mac isn’t exactly walking on air. Indeed, the person-
able Mr. McLaughlin is actually a little dissatified with his team’s
performance—and a bit fearful of Saturday’s encounter against
Emory and Henry.

“I know it sounds paradoxical, in view of the scores of our last
three games,” he says. “But we really haven’t had the kind of sus-
tained drive I'd like to see. Sure, we had very little trouble beating
those last three teams—but in each game, they made an early mis-
take that made it easy for us to score.

“Take last Saturday’s game with Hopkins, for example. The first
time they had the ball, their pass from center was high and we re-
covered on their one-yard line. That’s an awfully good break. In
the Randolph-Macon game, they fumbled the kickoff and we got the
ball.

Well what is it that the Generals aren’t doing? Are they letting
down after grabbing the early lead?

McLaughlin says no. “Our spirit and aggressiveness—I call it
‘eagerness —has been great almost all of the time. But we have a
few offensive errors we have to iron out, I think, and some defensive
holes to plug. Not really major faults, but just things I’d like to
see done smoother. I’d like to see us work up a more powerful, a
more sustained drive.”

“Dan Blain’s punting was great. That average of a little over 41
yards per punt for six punts is pretty terrific, especially on that
wet field. I was impressed with Blain and with Jerry Hyatt’s work
in centering the ball back to him. They did a good job, and we'll need
that Saturday because Emory and Henry really likes to rush the
kicker. They'll send eight men charging in every time.”

“Our defense was good when it had to be. We let them move the
ball quite a bit around midfield and they got 14 first downs. But they
were inside our 30-yard line only once, and that was on a 40-yard
pass interference penalty.

“And we had a touchdown on a punt return by Henry Sackett
called back on a clipping penalty. It was a nice runback. Doug Mar-
tin looked good. On both those touchdown runs of Martin’s, we sent
him into the game specifically for those plays, then took him out
right afterwards. He scored both times.”

But McLaughlin veered back from his optimism, as if fearing such
an attitude may jinx the Generals’ fortunes. He leaned back in his
big chair and watched films showing Emory and Henry running
roughshod over one of the four teams they have beaten this season.

“Those boys really blasted Hampden-Sydney Saturday. Held
them to 23 yards rushing, or something like that. We’re going to have
to play a much better brand of ball. Or else this may be it.”

 

By DON WALLIS
Washington and Lee’s 5-Star Generals—or, more appro-
priately its 45-Star Generals—remain unscathed after another
60 minutes of gridiron warfare Saturday.
Four platoons saw combat action as the unbeaten charges
of Coach Lee McLaughlin swept to their fourth win of the sea-
son, a convincing 38-6 thumping of Johns Hopkins University.

Sports Star Of The Week

 

Tommy Keesee
Outstanding In
Hopkins Game

Spirited all around play against
John Hopkins Saturday by fullback
Tommy Keesee has earned for the
General fullback the “Sports Star of
the Week” award.

Coach Lee McLaughlin and his
staff announced the selection of
Keesee in what Coach Mac termed
“one of the toughest decisions I’ve
had to make about this award.”

McLaughlin cited the SAE junior
from Memphis, Tenn., for his
“savage blocking and fine faking,”
as well as for the ten points he
racked up on a touchdown and a
pair of conversions.

Others Praised

The W&L head mentor also
praised end Dan Blain for his ex-
cellent punting performance and
linemen Tommy Goodwin, John
Madison, Phil McCaleb, Bob Payne
and Terry Fohs for general excel-
lence on defense.

Keesee, perhaps the hardest
runner on the undefeated Gen-
eral squad, is averaging over five
yards per carry this year. He
shares the fullback post with Doug
Martin.

The “Sports Star” award is not the
first recognition of Keesee. He was
named “Old Dominion Back of the
Week” by the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch for his efforts against Carnegie
Tech last year.

Added to the spoils of the lopsided
victory was the Generals’ satisfac-
tion in avenging last year’s 8-8 tie
with Hopkins, the only blemish on
an otherwise perfect season.

The Blue Jays lost, through grad-
uation, several of their top per-
formers from last year’s squad,
but it is doubtful they would have
made much difference even had
they been in the lineup Saturday.
For the W&L machine was oper-
ating at peak efficiency, both on
offense and defense, with all 45
players impressing the General
coaching staff and other onlookers
with their spirit and aggressive-
ness.

In fact, the Generals were, per-
haps, a bit too aggressive—they were
penalized a total of ninety yards,
compared to a paltry five yards
assessed against the Blue Jays. This
was the only factor which kept the
game from turning into a runaway
for W&L, as the Generals completely
outclassed their hosts throughout the
contest.

Saturday’s win was fully a team
effort, accomplished by the same
four-platoon system which coach
McLaughlin has used in rolling over
four opponents this year and vir-
tually the same system that crushed
eight foes last season. Both offensive
and defensive units were outstand-
ing. The defensive squad was dirctly
rsponsible for two W&L_ touch-
downs, including the initial tally
which launched the powerful Gen-
eral attack.

The Hopkins encounter was the
Generals’ last in preparation for next

GETTING READY—Captain Bip Fauber is shown above as
he leads this year’s General basketball squad through drills in
preparation for opener at Virginia, December 1.

W&L Basketball Squad Is Picked;
Lacks Height and Experience

Washington and Lee basketball
coach Bob McHenry, a “little man”
when he cavorted for General
basketball teams several years ago,
knows as well as anyone the dis-
advantage presented by lack of
height in modern basketball. And
after this season, it’s possible that
the vigorous young mentor will ap-
preciate this disadvantage better
than anyone.

McHenry made a tentative selec-
tion of the W&L varsity squad yes-
terday. Of 15 boys named to the
list, only two players are taller than
6’2”—and neither boy has had var-
sity experience.

So, according to McHenry, it will
be another year for the Generals

 

to emphasize a scrapping, aggres-
sive defense—and hope for a few
shooters to come along and bolster
the offensive attack, which will be
greatly hampered by the expected
lack of rebounding strength.

Lacks Experience

Experience may also be a problem.
Only four players—“Bip” Fauber,
Billy Ide, Dave Grogan and Billy
Smith—are back from last season,
and McHenry believes the key to
the Generals’ success may well lie
with the large group of inexper-
ienced performers that make up the
rest of the squad.

The Generals’ schedule will be
highlighted by a 17-game season.
The Opener will be with Virginia.

Topics Were Apathy And Politics

the definite minority and these same students began to point leading
questions directly at him. Luckily, someone proposed a question
to another member of the panel before anything drastic happened.

Conservative Trend: Fact or Fancy

One question the correspondents wanted answered by the editors
was “is the growing conservative trend fact or fancy on the college
campus?”

Answers ranged from one pole to another.

“Our students are strictly middle of the road,” said the Lehigh
representative.

Barnard’s editor said tht “the Conservative Club is gaining in
membership but its still regarded as odd. When we wanted to pub-
lish a “pro” and “con” on a Queens College action against barring
a Communist from speaking, no one wanted to write the “pro”
“until we finally dug up a freshman.”

A representative from Mt. Holyoke said that “there is a vocal
liberal group, but the Conservatives just sit there quietly.”

A Hofstra student said that “the Conservative groundswell has
reached that of the Liberals—that makes us middle of the road.

The group discussion which I attended was highlighted by ques-
tions from members of the foreign press. One such question was
“Do you think that the liberal arts are taking a second place in
American Education?”

One editor said that he thought that the liberal arts had become
second rate in education because of Russia’s great advance in science.

Another editor said that he reasoned the drop in the liberal arts
came from the fact that the term “liberal arts” had become so mis-
used in that too many subjects are being included in this field.

* * *

All in all, I can say that the conference was useful. It gave us
a chance to hear the opinions of other editors, and likewise it gave
us the opportunity to see and talk with some of the top correspon-
dents of the foreign press.

I just hope that next year’s editors will have more Southern
colleagues to help them out than we did.

Is W&L Encouraging Students To Think?

(Continued from page 2)

Washington and Lee has always been considered to be a place
where any honorable man could have his say, and where he would
be listened to and evaluated by honorable men. My conception of a
university is a place where all students are encouraged to think—
not taught to think, directed to think, or involuntarily forced not to
think.

The decision of the Board of Trustees concerning Dr. King
forces me to change my conception in regard to this University, as it
forces the Board of Trustees to examine their conception.

I can only hope that in their examination they come up with an

idea that resembles mine, and that they will find that their most

recent decision completely violates this conception.

issue sold eighty-six copies, a rec-
ord for the last three years com-
bined.

The very day the Shenandoah was
released I was paged in the Lyric.
Some guy from New York wanted
to publish my work in book form.
I told him to go ahead and do
anything he wanted, just get off the
phone before I miss the part where
Rory Calhoun tries his hand at the
fertility dance, the best part of the
whole flick.

The next night I was paged again
right before Rory did his bit. This
time the call was from California.
Cedric B. DeVille wanted to do a
spectacular with my book as script.
I was so excited that we talked right
through the part where Gabby Hayes
trips over his beard and gets tram-
pled by the fertility dancers.

The world premier was to be
held right here in the “Shrine of
the South”; so after calling around |
at a few girls’ schools, I was finally |
able to get a date at a nearby
high school. We would have to
make the early flick, though,
because she had to be in at 9:30.
The picture began with Fabian

Assimilation Committee Chairman Protests

(Continued from page 2)

I should like to urge the editor to
take a tour of a number of cam-
puses throughout the state and ob-
serve the dress, conduct, and atti-
tude there. To most observers, there
is little noteworthy about the way
other student bodies look—ours is a
fortunate exception in my opinion.
Do we want to become “just another
school” or do we want to remain
exceptional? Is it so difficult to
wear a coat and tie or to speak to
someone when you meet on the
campus? Does not this extra effort
yield a greater return in favorable
impressions of Washington and Lee?

My final point concerns the edi-
tor’s contention that we are a group
of “nice little boys all dressed up
in our Little Lord Fauntleroy uni-
forms.” There is a social theory that
one acts according to the way the
dresses or stated as I have learned
the lesson in athletics, “if you're
sloppy in practice or in the dressing
room, you'll be sloppy in the game.”
One at least appears to have the
semblance of a mature young man

 

a coat and tie. This institution

intends to build character and turn
out exceptional and_ responsible
graduates. As the dean of a noted
graduate school once said “if we’re
going to train you to think like
businessmen, you should begin by
dressing accordingly.” In my own
mind, this applies to whatever ma-
jor one has, be it History, English,
or Commerce.

When the times comes that this
university has to send out into the
mature world of business challenge
and social responsibility graduates
dressed in blue jeans, sneakers, and
sweatshirts, then I shall do away
with an Assimilation Committee.
Until then, I shall be proud that we
operate under “the rules of a gentle-
man”—starting with dress.

Shamefully, It Stands

(Continued from page 3)

The supposition is the same in
both cases: first, that the product
has been judged and found harmful
and second, that the reader or list-
ener is not capable of making his
own evaluation.

Many adjectives could be prefixed
to The Decision. I prefer to think
that it was not well thought out and
hastily done but that does not les-
sen its impact for the students or the
school. Shamefully, it stands.

University Continues To Expand
Program For Undergraduate Aid

Undergraduate financial aid at
Washington and Lee this year totals
$169,992—a $15,873 increase over the
1960-61 total—as the university en-
ters the second year of an expanded
scholarship-loan program.

Sharing in the total aid are 201
students—18 per cent of Washington
and Lee’s 1,061 undergraduate en-
rollment, according to James D.
Farrar, Director of Student Financial
Aid and Scholarships.

This year’s increase follows a
seven-year pattern of rising scholar-
ship aid at Washington and Lee.
In 1954-55, financial assistance to
students was $44,970. This figure rose
to $66,240 for 1956-57. Aid for the
1958-59 academic year jumped to
$119,280.

Some 200 students shared in $154,-
119 when the financial aid program
was expanded in September 1960.
Key feature of this new program is
a loan system through which appli-
cants for financial aid assistance have
an opportunity to borrow from
Washington and Lee at least a por-
tion of the cost of their education.
The remaining would be covered by
outright scholarships.

The $169,992 in aid to students this
year is being furnished through
scholarship awards, loans and on-

campus jobs, Mr. Farrar said.

In the 319-man freshman class, 59
new students—19 per cent of the
group—are sharing in $54,035 as

dowed scholarships, entirely admin-

and Lee, total $46,635.

Says ‘Times’ Military Editor

By BILL

The United States is “still the strongest power in the world

should,’ Hanson W. Baldwin, military editor of the New York
Times, told the corps of cadets of Virginia Military Institute

here Wednesday.

Troubadours Set To Open
Season Tuesday Evening
With “Boy Meets Girl”

The Troubadours, univer-
sity dramatic group, will open
its 1961-62 season Tuesday
night when the curtain rises

on “Boy Meets Girl.”

The play will run through Friday
at the Troub theater on Main Street.

A farce about the movie-making
world, “Boy Meets Girls” stars Scott
Iacone and Jim Applebaum as a
team of studio songwriters.

They become involved in the pro-
motion of a sensational baby star,
around which the play centers.

The Troubs in producing the play
have dabbled in songwritting and
movie-making according to Publicity
Director Andy Leonard.

Leonard said Applebaum and Ia-
cone have written a song for the
play entitled “There’s a Pain in My
Heart,” and “My Heart’s on My
Sleeve.”

He said that the second act begins
with a film short publicizing Happy
(the baby actor) which the Troubs
produced themselves.

‘said, although the USSR is expand-
ing more rapidly in areas relating
to military potential.

Speaking to the cadets for the
fourth time since 1955, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning military expert re-
viewed the United States and Rus-
sian positions in the major arms
fields. He said the United States is
still ahead in virtuaily every de-
partment except actual manpower.

Nuclear Subs

He declared nuclear submarines
“have transformed sea warfare. They
now are used strategically rather
than as guerrillas.”

The Russians, he added, have
seven to nine such vessels built or
building compared to more than 29
for the United States.

This country, he said, is well
ahead in piloted aircraft, in nuclear
weapons both from the standpoint
of quality and quantity and is
equal or ahead of the Russians in
missile development on an over-
all basis.

In space development, he added,
“we have nothing to be ashamed of

What makes an egghead at Wash-
ington and Lee? If anyone can quali-
fy, it would certainly be the same
four men who have become the
University’s representatives in the
G.E. Quiz Bowl.

Bill Lowry, Jim Campbell, Tom
Lybass, and Rick Anderson went
through extensive testing in com-
petition with 63 of the top minds
on campus before emerging as the
contestants who will be sent to New
York on Nov. 12 to face either Po-
mona or Amherst College with
W&L’s academic honor at stake.

There are some striking similar-
ities between the members of the
Quiz Bowl team. All except An-
derson are non-fraternity men,
and 3 graduated from public high
schools. Each of them attributes
his store of knowledge to a vast
amount of reading, accomplished
principally before college.

Bill Lowry, a junior, graduated
from a high school in Hobbs, New
Mexico. He takes courses in French,
German, history, comparative reli-
gion, and philosophy, his major. It
is not surprising that his outside
reading is channeled along his
schoolwork. But he confessed to
reading the Saturday Review, the
New Republic, and the National Re-
view; he subscribes to the Wash-
ington Post and the New York Times
Sunday edition.

 

Tom Lybass, a sophomore, also

Quiz Bowl Team Gets Facts
From Reading—And Reading

said that he had more time to read
when he was in high school in
Jacksonville, Florida, than he does at
present.

Lybass likes reading all types of
books ranging from novels to history,
to psychology and psychiatry. His
special loves are Shakespeare and
the Italian Renaissance. He is now
reading a Stendahl novel, some
German lectures, and two Shake-
spearean plays which remain out-
side his experience.

Jim Campbell is the only mem-
ber of the team who attended prep
school. A graduate of Lawrence-
ville at 15, he is still waiting for
his draft card as a W&L junior.
Campbell also did most of his
reading in prep school, and is
presently reading a book of
French poetry, a volume of Ger-
man quotations, Major Voices in
American Theology, and one or
two novels.

Rick Anderson, a senior from
Startex, South Carolina, is an Eng-
lish major. Another high school
graduate, he is now studying
Shakespeare, the Romantics, con-
temporary literature, French, and
German. Despite this number of
courses, he manages to do about two
hours of extra reading each day.
He reads all types of books—any-
thing that interests him. He feels
that his omnibus reading has given
him the wide background necessary
for his Quiz Bowl position.

Board’s Decision On King

By STEVE SMITH
Student opinion at Washington and Lee solidified against

‘|the action of the University Board of Trustees during the

past week as an atmosphere of indignation spread and strength-

ened.

A Ring-tum Phi poll indicated that the student body re-

 

Student Bar

Indicts Board

A resolution censuring the

Washington and Lee Board

of Trustees was passed by the
Student Bar Association on

_ | Wednesday.

The resolution reads as follows:
Whereas, the Board of Trustees of
this University has refused permis-
sion to a student group to sponsor

eS a lecture by Martin Luther King
#| upon this campus, and

Whereas, it is the considered
opinion of the Student Bar Associa-
tion of this University that such

# | action is an infringement of academ-

ic freedom and against the spirit
of intellectual inquiry which should
prevail upon this campus;

BE IT RESOLVED, therefore, that
the Student Bar Association is op-
posed to such infamous rulings by
the Board of Trustees.

 

Notice

The Young Republicans’ member-
ship committee will meet at 5 p.m.
Monday in the Student Union.
All fraternities are requested to send
one Republican representative to the
meeting.

The regular meeting of the club
is scheduled for 7 p.m. Tuesday in
the Student Union.

 

Freshmen Get
Fewer U’s

Freshmen this year totaled
up almost 100 fewer ‘U’s”
than last year’s class in the an-
nual “S” and ““U” reports giv-
en out to each year’s entering
class six weeks after the semes-

ter begins.

In the breakdown, 92 freshmen
got one U, 32 received two, 17 got
three, and three boys were issued
four Z’s. No one received more than
four.

This is a total of 219 unsatisfactory
reports out of 1,590 issued. Last year
316 U’s were given out.

Grade wise, the U’s shaped up like
this: “D’s,” 138; “F plus,” 41; and
“7 8.

According to Dean of Students
Frank J. Gilliam, this year’s fresh-
man class is “better prepared” than
last year’s class. He said there had

 

been a 20-point increase in college

board scores over the previous year.

 

sented the Board’s decision to with-
hold approval from Martin Luther
King as a campus speaker with
nearly complete unanimity.

Of students questioned, only one
was able to agree with the Board’s
decree; but the student was not
reconciled to the Board’s failure
to explain its decision to the
university.

General feeling seemed to run
most strongly over the fact that the
decision was apparently an abri-
trary one and was handed down to
the school without justification.

These were some of the best-ex-
pressed ideas on the subject:

“The Trustees had in mind the
good of the school,” said Pete Age-
lasto—“but looking from a student’s
point of view this appears debate-
able, as proved by the reaction. “It
is unfortunate that the school can
be treated to such speakers as Gold-
water and Norman Thomas and
be denied King, though all would
receive disagreeing views. It should
be the privilege of the University
to hear such speakers.”

W&L Image Harmed

Rosie Page said that the Board’s
withholding of approval “severely
tarnished the ideal of the Universi-
ty—as far as intellectual freedom
is concerned.” He noted the irony
of King’s being banned on the same
weekend as were the Hot Nuts, while
the Isley Brothers and Lloyd Price
were on display in the gym.

“They have no reason as far as I
can see in banning Martin Luther
King. There is no reason why the
man shouldn’t speak here, absolutely
none.”

“I myself am a segregationist,
but I see no reason why the Uni-
versity shouldn’t hear his argu-
ment.”

Faculty Objects

From a faculty point of view,
Dr. James Leyburn stated: “I
think it was a lamentable deci-
sion.” Leyburn termed the situa-
tion “terrible.”

L. R. Emmons of the biology de-
partment said, “I think it was a
terrible injustice. I see no reason
why the man shouldn’t be invited
to speak here.”

Bill Noell: “Certainly Dr. King is
a leader in a broad movement about
which all of us have deep emotional
and intellectual feelings. I think it a
shame that this student body will
not have a chance to hear his views
firsthand, and then have the addi-
tional opportunity to question him
about them.”

Mark Haeberle: Definitely Martin
Luther King should be here. Most of
the students, uninformed and not
exposed to this question, would

Discuss The American Press

By BILL ROBERTS

Some of the most interesting comments at last
weekend’s student press conference at Hamilton Col-
lege came from the two Communists correspondents—
from Poland and Yugoslavia—who attended.

Their ideas brought out very clearly the direct
opposition between their thinking and that of our own
countrymen,

Yugosolavia is not a member of the Soviet bloc
and Poland is allowed more freedom of thought than
Mr. K’s other East European satellites, thus we were
very fortunate to meet journalists from these two
countries.

It is hard to believe that Communism is here to
stay or that it has any widespread acceptance. How-
ever, we came away with the feeling that they as
individuals were just as sure that we are wrong as
we are sure that they are.

Zivko Milic of Yugoslavia, who has spent
several years in Southeast Asia, looked around at
the handsome Hamilton campus, the well-
dressed, well-fed students and their late model
cars and quoted for me some statistics on per-
sonal income in Asia, while P. G. Khrishnaya of
India threw in a few figures of his own. “It’s
fine for all of you to be conservatives here,”
Milic said, “but this won’t do for the whole
world. Why don’t you join us?”

Mr. Khrishnaya, who owns several newspapers
and a news service in India, just grinned at both of
us.

Mr. Khrishnaya did no damage to the impression
we have from Mr. Nehru that the Indians are not
exerting the moral leadership they should by taking
a stand against some of the more flagrant warlike acts
of the Soviet Union.

Earlier in the day he had said that he understood
that Americans were disappointed with Mr. Nehru’s
“neutralism,” and asked the students to speak out
“boldly” saying what they thought of Mr. Nehru.

The moderator, Richard Bricker of Hamilton, drew
a big laugh from every one except Mr. Khrishnaya,
when he drew back and said, “Well I don’t know if I
should say anything. I ought to remain neutral!”

The panel had spent a good deal of time discussing
their respective national presses. The foreign cor-
respondents wanted to know everything about our
college newspapers: where their financial support
came from, our editorial policies, how much freedom
we had to take our own editorial stands, what sort of
editorial campaigns we ran, the circulation of our
papers, and how the editors and staff members were
chosen.

We in turn wanted to know something about their
own newspapers. Several of us were particularly
curious about the status of the press in the two
Communist nations represented.

How objective was the press in Yugoslavia
and Poland?

“We don’t believe that there is an unpolitical press,”
said Zivko Milic of Yugoslavia. “We are very po-
litically-minded. The American press may try to hide
it, but they are not.”

“We don’t think we need to hide anything from our
people...in contrast to the time when we were
strongly influenced by the Soviet Union,” said Mr.
Milic.

Wladyslaw Pawlak of Poland, the only represen-
tative of a Soviet bloc nation at the conference, had
much the same attitude: “We think we are giving a
very fair coverage of what’s going on in the world.
We don’t claim to be objective and we're not trying
to be objective.”

The Polish press represents “a wide variety of
political affiliations,’ according to Mr. Pawlak.

Every correspondent on the panel discussion

I took part in Friday afternoon, including Messrs.

Milic and Pawlak, affirmed that all the material

he sent home was published and that he was

never instructed to slant his stories in any par-

ticular political direction.

“How objective is the U.S. press?” someone asked
Mr. Milic.

He stated that the American press “distorts” news.
He felt that while there may be little deliberate at-

tempt to distort news, “You have editorial boards,
advertisers.”

Mr. Milic challenged the college editors on the
panel to name one “liberal” paper, or one “leftist”
paper in the United States. He said that all United
States publications of this sort are “small reviews
or magazines, published by intellectuals. They are
starving.

“We think we are more objective than you,” he
concluded.

Asked about freedom of the press in Poland,
Mr. Pawlak told the students “You stand on the
basic policy of your country and government...
We don’t think we should exacerbate issues on
domestic affairs.

Americans mistook the fight over “freedom of the
press” in Poland several years ago, he pointed out.
“It was a discussion between the working journalists
and the government.”

The American press came under strong criticism
from panelists other than the two Communists. The
students themselves said the American press is too
“local” and should put more emphasis on international
affairs.

The students felt that too often our own news-
papers refuse to take a strong stand or take a stand
that is predetermined.

THE RING-

TUM PHI

No Guts--No Glory

It will be a long time before the Martin
Luther King case is forgotten here. The in-
cident will be remembered not only as a vio-
lation of academic freedom, but also as the
time when a great many people began to
question seriously the direction of Washing-
ton and Lee’s leadership.

The United States is engaged in a fright-
ening struggle for world leadership. The de-
mand on the resources of courage and intel-
lect of every American grows daily.

We hope that Washington and Lee is do-
ing her part to develop these qualities in her
students.

But what does the University do to develop
courage and intellect? We fear she has done
precious little recently.

It took courage to drop subsidized foot-
ball in 1954. Where was the courage to invite
Martin Luther King?

It takes courage to institute bold innova-
tions in a course and hour system which ties
professors and students to the stale art of

synthesis rather than critical study. Instead
of the more demanding intellectual reform
we are given new buildings and new adminis-
trative aids. There is little wonder Washing-
ton and Lee life centers around the cock-
tail party.

While the virtues of the mind go, to a large
extent, unrewarded and unencouraged, physi-
cal exercise is discouraged even more. Sand
traps pass for tennis courts. Game periods
that would dishonor most elementary schools
pass for ‘‘Physical Education.” Varsity teams
spend thousands of dollars but intramural
fields cannot be marked properly.

General Lee is remembered here for more
things than his moral leadership. He was
an important academic innovator.

Washington and Lee is in a rut. We need
to follow the men who welcome useful change
and we need to be done with those who fear
any change will be for the worst. It is time
we stopped listening to excuses and pledged
ourselves to get the job done. Where is W&L’s
backbone?

 

Assimilation--Round Two

We fear Mr. Rutledge’s defense of the
Assimilation Committee printed in Tuesday’s
Ring-tum Phi was more impassioned than
reasoned.

Far from attacking the committee as “‘lax,”’
we feel that they do an exceptionally fine job
under the circumstances. The circumstances
are rather trying—attempting to decide what
a man should wear at any given time and
whether or not he should have greeted some-
one else at any given time.

The good judgment of the Assimilation
Cimmittee has long been a strong argument
for its continuation. It still is.

But does Mr. Rutledge really think W&L
would change into a “jeans and T-shirt”’
school? We can’t believe it. We do have our
share of people who prefer such attire. But

we still think most of the student body would
choose to wear coats and ties, just as they do
now.

Further, if so much pressure were not put
on students to wear coats and ties outside of
class, there might grow up a healthy awareness
that being nicely dressed doesn’t make up for
bad manners. Ask any Lexington resident—
W&L students seem to feel that the coat-and-
tie makes even the most elementary courtesies
unnecessary.

You just can’t legislate gentlemen.

And, Mr. Rutledge, instead of sitting
around in court up there in the Student
Union on Tuesday nights, wouldn’t you and
your committee rather simply administer a
few quick pushups to freshmen when you
caught them without their beanies?

 

Comments

Speak Up!

The faculty and student body will have
an opportunity this week to join the petition
being circulated by Mr. Lowry, which con-
cerns a recent decision endangering the right
of free inquiry at Washington and Lee.

There is not much more that either the
Ring-tum Phi or Protest can say. It is up to
the student body to stand up for the rights
that are supposedly guaranteed it by the Uni-
versity. The petition is the only way for you
to be heard, even if the words fall on deaf
ears.

Let us not display any more of the kind of
courage currently being exhibited here. Sign
the petition.

We ourselves differ with Dr. King on a
number of points. Matter of fact, we had
some questions to ask him. We resent very
deeply not being given the opportunity to
ask him those questions.

S&U’s

This year’s freshman class probably has
fewer “U’s’” on their six-week reports than
any previous class. Their record is a credit to
their preparation and motivation.

It is also evident that academic competi-
tion will be much tougher than it has been in
the past. Students who did poorly on the
**Sa¢U’s” are well-warned, we are sure. Wash-
ington and Lee, for all her faults, is no breeze.

 

Mildew, ’66, Discusses WGL Courses

just about every educated man ought

By STEVE HENRY

September 24, 1965
Dear Mother and Daddy,

Well, rush week is finally over
(I’m a wreck), and I thought I
would drop you a few lines about
the courses I’m taking this semester,
since you are both so interested in
what I’m doing up here.

Well, I'll tell you, I have really
got some hard courses this year, and
I don’t know if I’m ever going to
make it out of here now that they’ve
got this new program that every-
body’s so crazy about.

Take my sociology course, for
instance. It’s called White Suprem-
acy 101—A Study of the Master
Race. Believe me it looks like a real
monster, even though I like my pro-
fessor, who used to teach in the
commerce school but got switched
over after the big shift happened.

It’s going to take a lot of outside
reading—lI can tell that already. The

main problem is having to subscribe |
to all those Mississippi newspapers, |

which are expensive and all that.
They used to have newspapers in the
library until they closed it. Now
you have to walk all the way to
McCrum’s to get the papers unless
they’re delivered to the house.

 

And, my God, you wouldn’t be-
lieve this religion course I’ve got.
It’s Comparative Religion 256, the
Various Branches of the Episcopal
Church. You know, it looks like
since everybody going here is Epis-
copal that this would be an easy
course, but it sure isn’t. You both
would be real surprised, I bet, if
you really started doing some serious
research into the church, with
broad-minded viewpoint and all. I
sure was.

My best subject, as always, is
history. This semester I’m taking
a dandy history course called His-
tory 290, which is a Civil War course
dealing with the period between the
attack on Fort Sumter and the
Battle of Bull Run. They used to
teach a course called History 291,
which was all about the rest of the
war, but they’ve discontinued it,
thank goodness. No one wants to
hear about all those awful things,
anyway.

Why I ever got into a commerce
course, I'll never know. My course in
Tobacco and Cotton Marketing is
just horrible, even though I know
it'll be invaluable when I get out
in the world and have to go it alone.
I am sure glad in a way that I’m
taking the course, because I believe

to have a little business sense. Like
you've said so many times, Daddy,
“a well-rounded man knows a little
about everything.”

The last course I’m taking is the
one I told you about this summer.
You know, the advanced political
science course that I had to try out
for last spring called Insular Diplo-
macy. Well, they tried to get a good
visiting professor here to teach the
course, and they sure did.

His name is Wayne Poucher, and
from what I hear, he used to be a
radio personality before he came
down here to teach. I’ve been to two
of his lectures already, and he sure
has some great ideas. I’ll guarantee

Interview With Major Roxbury

 

Atomic War: Our Alternatives

By TRACY HARRINGTON

“There is no such thing as a non-
atomic war today.”

With this statement, Major Ed-
ward J. Roxbury, head of the de-
partment of military science at W&L,
began defining “war” in the post-
World War II 20th Century.

In an informal interview, he gave
his ideas on the liklihood of war
and the kind of war he thought
would probably be fought.

“We may be able to fight a non-
active atomic war, but any war
today would have to be atomic,” he
said.

Maj. Roxbury defined “atomic
war” as the use of any weapons
that “produce a mushroom-shaped
cloud.”

A non-active atomic war would
be simply the conflict up to the time
atomic weapons were used.

Maj. Roxbury said that “we can-
not hope for non-atomic war with
Russia.”

Room for Trust?

“In the first place,” he said, “what
assurance have we that Russia would
keep an agreement not to use atomic
weapons? We don’t believe anything
she tells us now, and she doesn’t
believe anything we tell her.

“As soon as an attractive, lucrative
target is presented to one side or
the other, they may use atomic
weapons—especially if they start
losing a non-active war.”

What are the chances of avoiding
total war altogether?

Maj. Roxbury smiled at this one. |
“If war is to cease,” he said, “we|*

must assume that human nature has
changed, that we are smarter than
our ancestors, and that we have an
immediate solution to the problem of
a world-wide set of values.”

“There have always been wars,”
he said.

He said that whether or not we
enter a war depends to a great deal
on cost versus gain.

“Limited” Wars

For instance, he cited the wars
presently going on in Vietnam and

 

Laos. “We can afford liimted war
in these countries,” he said, “con-
sidering man-power available and
gain from the conflicts.”

What about limited war in Europe?
Can we afford or do we have the
alternative of limited war there?
Maj. Roxbury was dubious.

“We probably don’t have enough
force for a limited war in Germany.

“It is a question of whether or
not such a conflict is acceptable both
to the United States and Russia. And
even if it is acceptable, there is
some doubt as to its availability to
us.”

Backtracking for a moment, Maj.

 

Major Roxbury

Roxbury clarified just what is meant
by “limited” and “total” war.
“Limited war,” he said, “is any-
thing short of total war—and total
war is the aim to destroy completely
the enemy’s ability to strike back.”
He lauded President Kennedy for
trying to “make limited war possible
once again in Europe.” He said that
it is “extremely doubtful” that we

have the alternative of limited war
in Europe now, and specifically in
Germany.

Several Possibilities

What about survival? Is it possible
to go through an atomic holocaust?

According to Maj. Roxbury, “the
presumption is that we can.

“We would lose tremendous num-
bers of people, but if atomic wea-
pons are employed in militarily
proper way, we would probably sur-
vive.

“If and when this country enters
a full-scale atomic world war, it
must be with the awareness of
certain pre-determined political ob-
jectives. And in that war, we must
be ready to endure until those ob-
jectives are met.”

Harsh Realities

What are those objectives? Major
Roxbury described “what we must
do” in chilling terms.

“When we enter a war, we must
decide that we will carry the thing
on after New York and Moscow
disappear.

“We must decide to fight on until
we are able to dictate the peace—
notice I said dictate the peace, not
win. Nobody will win.”

As a military man more in the
know than the average citizen, how
does Major Roxbury feel personally
about a war?

“The thought of a war now scares
me to death,” he said.

He added, referring to an eventual

|| conflict with the U. S. S. R., that

“time is on our side.”

He said that world revolutions
have always become parochial, and
eventually they begin to compromise
with existing systems.

“They take (ideas) from you,
and you take from them.”

An educated militarist, then, pre-
sents this picture: either probable
atomic war with the communist
world, or eventual integration of de-
mocracy and communism.

Either way, the picture isn’t the
prettiest one.

 

Austrian Scholar Likes America,
But Criticizes Attitude Abroad

By ROBIN WOOD

Alfred Schmalfuss is an Austrian
public school teacher who received
a Fulbright scholarship in 1948 and
studied in the United States at the
University of Cincinnati. In Vienna
this summer I asked him about his
first impressions of our country and
how he regards Americans today.

“The boat trip ever was somewhat
of a harrowing experience,” laughed
the large, balding professor. “We
were traveling on an old U.S. Navy
transport ship filled to the brink
with GI’s who had not seen their
homeland in four years. Well, the
captain didn’s know we were stu-
dents and he put us on KP and made
us swab the deck with the rest of
the grimy crew.”

“T must admit I was rather scept-
ical about the whole situation,” con-
tinued Mr. Schmalfuss, “but my
opinion of the American people was
quickly changed upon landing at
New York. The first thing I wanted
to do was to buy a hot dog, so I
went into a small restaurant near
the dock. A great big, fat woman
behind the counter recognized me
as a foreign student and wished me
good luck and really made me feel
comfortable for the first time since
I had left Austria.”

The American college campus
favorably impressed the young
Austrian. He considered most of
the students very affable and
courteous, and he was overwhelm-
ed by the way Americans went
out of their way to help and give
him assistance.

“There wasn’t anything that they
wouldn’t do for me.”

After his first year at the Uni-
versity of Cincinnati, Mr. Schmal-
fuss wanted to see more of this
country, so he set out alone to
hitchhike across the United States.
He spent the entire summer of 1949
traveling through the western and
southwestern states.

“The experiences of that summer
are still vivid in my memory, and
I will always cherish them,” he
reminisced.

 

When Mr. Schmalfuss returned to
his home in Vienna, he immediately
applied for immigration papers, for
he thought that America was the
most wonderful place that he had
ever seen. He was willing to dissolve
all family bonds and relationships
and make a new start in life in a
country where there was unlimited
opportunity and prosperity.

But Herr Schmalfuss’s dreams
were destined not to come true.
President Truman curtailed the im-
migration quota, and he was placed
on the waiting list where his name
still remains today.

Now that it has been twelve years
since his visit to America, Profes-
sor Schmalfuss doesn’t believe that
he could make a new life in Amer-
ica, though he does want to visit
our country again.

“Twenty to thirty are the de-
cisive years of one’s life. After
thirty you don’t want to pull up
roots and start all over again.
You ask yourself whether life
will be better than before.”

“Vienna has a culture which I
have grown to love—the Opera, the
concerts at the Rathaus, the rich
historical heritage. I have learned
to see the good with the bad, and
I realize that my people are not so
horrible after all. I don’t believe that
America could fill the void in my
life if I were to leave Vienna and
the Austrians now.”

Mr. Schmalfuss’s opinion of Amer-
icans has not been radically changed.
He thinks that Americans, in gener-
al, are “practical” people, except for
two matters. He can’t understand
why we hold our knife in our right
hand and cut and then go through
the awkward procedure of transfer-
ing the fork from our left hand to
our right in order to eat. To him,
this is highly unpractical and non-
sensical. Secondly, he can’t reconcile
the fact why most students and many
business men will not carry their
papers and books in a briefcase.

If this were all that Mr. Schmal-
fuss felt was wrong with Americans,

To the Editor:

In your recent editorial, “Con-

 

servative Chaos,” you state that
“Above all, we hoped that the So-
ciety would attempt to state clearly
the principles of conservatism, show-
ing that the principles could be
practically applied to national gov-
ernment.” The whole editorial is
predicated on the assumption that
this attempt was to be our sole
purpose. While this is to be one of
our purposes, it is not the sole pur-
pose. Additionally, we should like
to provide an open forum for sin-
cere inquiry into vital isues of na-
tional and international significance.

We do not believe that the Friday
editors necessarily endorse the views
of M. L. King solely because they
defend the right of another campus
organization to inquire into them.
Because Mr. Goldsboro spoke at the
invitation of the conservative society,
it does not necessarily follow that
the society indorses his views in
toto, nor is it to be implied that
the society is in total disagreement
with the speaker or the film. If the
writer of this editorial had not pre-
conceived for us the sole purpose
of our society, his “intelligence”
would not have been offended.

I-M Tennis Finalists

By HOWIE KORMAN
The I-M tennis championship enters its final round today
when Beta meets Phi Kap on the lower courts. In the double-
elimination tournament, Phi Kap is undefeated, while Beta has

lost one match.

On October 26, Beta stayed alive by ousting PiKA from

the tourney by a score of 3-2. The*

winners took an early advantage
when Ray Gordon downed John
Graham 6-1, 6-0, and Ron Hornbur-
ger defeated Greg Lebediv 6-2, 6-2.

In the doubles, John Gillet and
Al Painter of PiKA won 6-3, 6-1,
while teammate Fred Webb was
evening the match at two victories
apiece by outplaying Whit Fitzpat-
rick.

 

Bowling Rules
Are Published

The followin regulations regard-
ing intramural bowling have been

released by the I-M office.

1. Teams must report according to
schedule. Failure to be at the alley
within 15 minutes of the scheduled
time will result in a forfeit.

2. A double forfeit will be called
in the event that both teams fail
to appear.

3. Teams which forfeit will be re-
sponsible for the cost of the alleys
for themselves and their opponents,
unless, of course, the opponents
choose to remain and bowls for their
own pleasure in which event the
amount forfeited will be equal to
the cost which the fraternity would
have expended had they bowled.
This sanction will not be imposed if
either the senior I-M manager or
the manager of the bowling alley is
notified of the intended forfeiture
24 hours in advance of the sche-
duled match.

In the deciding match, top singles
player Steve Parel took the open-
ing set from PiKA’s John Trible
6-0, only to have Trible rally from
an early deficit to tie the second
set 6-6. Parel then managed to
break through his opponent’s service
and hold his own to win the con-
test for Beta, 3-2.

The winners’ only defeat in the
tournament was at the hands of
the team they will face this after-
noon, Phi Kap.

Swimming

On October 24, the I-M swimming
finals were held after the peliminar-
ies had been completed on the
previous night. The natators from
Sigma Chi captured three first
places, while Delt and Pi Phi each
captured two.

The only double winner of the
evening was freshman John Wolfe
of Sigma Chi. Wolfe edged out
Bruce Jackson in the 200-yard free-
style with a time of 2:10.4, while
he also won the 100-yard individual
medley in 1:05.1.

Pi Phi was victorious in both
relays. Their swimmers turned in
times of 1.21.8 and 1:39.9 in the

Fohs Too Light
For NFL Ball,
Says Coach Mac

Washington and Lee Head Coach
Lee McLaughlin, who played some
pro ball with the Green Bay Pack-
ers of the National Football League
during his playing days, got a let-
ter from the Packer front office the
other day.

They wanted to know more about
this linebacker named Terry Fohs,
who was an All-American candidate
for Coach Mac’s undefeated Gen-
erals.

McLaughlin wrote and told the
Packers that Terry was a mite too
small for pro ball.

“You'll never find a tougher man,
though,” he added.

McLaughlin says that Fohs play-
ed perhaps his finest college game
against Johns Hopkins last week.

Fohs, assigned to meeting Hop-
kins’ single-wing power head-on,
was credited with more than 20
tackles.

Blain, Hyatt

A center and a punter also came
in for special praise from McLaugh-
lin after last Saturday’s 36-6 win.

Center Jerry Hyatt made seven
bulls-eye centers to end Dan Blain,
who boomed seven punts for a 41.5
average that kept the Generals out
of trouble and the Jays on the
defensive.

General followers can expect to
see more of sophomore halfback
Stu Yoffe. He ran the ball only
three times against the Jays, but
picked up 78 yards in the process,
including a 19-yard TD run during
which he literally ran over a Hop-
kins defender.

* * *

Doug Martin, W&L’s 155-pound
All-State fullback, returned to his
1960 form against Hopkins, scoring
twice on runs of eight and 62 yards.

On both occasions, McLaughlin
wild-carded Martin with the instruc-
tions “,get us a touchdown.”

Generals Meet Wasps

Emory & Henry Toughest

 

Booters Get
2nd Victory

The General booters won their
second game of the 1961 season by
defeating King College, 10-3, Thurs-
day at Wilson Field.

Playing better than in their pre-
vious games, W&L was able to
penetrate the weak defense of their
opponents almost at will.

The first period saw Dave Knight,
last year’s captain, contribute three
goals for the victors. Also scor-
ing for the Generals was Steve
Hibbard.

During the second period, W&L
continued to use the fast break and
effective passing to score three more
goals.

The third period saw Knight
leading the General offense again,
but with the aid of freshman star
Gil Slingerland and Charlie Sweet.

Finally in the fourth period, Coach
Lyles was able to use his 3rd string
and the game ground to a standstill.

The Generals’ next game is with
Roanoke on November 3.

Opponent On

’61 Schedule

It’s been some time now since Washington and Lee’s Coach
Lee McLaughlin has had the opportunity to assume the college
coach’s favorite role—the underdog.

But McLaughlin, in good conscience, says his undefeated

Generals (4-0) might well be

the underdogs in their home

engagement with powerful Emory and Henry (4-1).
“I’m willing to accept Coach Stokely Fulton’s evaluation

of our team when he says Emory*
and Henry is the best team Hamp-
den-Sydney has played this year,”
says McLaughlin. “Of course, we’re
going to do our level best Saturday
to prove he’s wrong.”

But, adds the W&L coach with a
solemn expression, “There’s no doubt
about it, we’re going to have a tiger
by the tail this week.”

Common Foe

Hampden-Sydney is the only com-
mon foe the Wasps and Generals
have faced. W&L had a rough time
in defeating the Tigers, 7-6, and
E&H had a relatively easy go of it,
winning 16-0 last Saturday.

“We're certainly not expecting
Emory and Henry to spot us an
eight-point gift in the first period,
like the last three teams we've
played have done,” McLaughlin
points out.

On the basis of scouting reports
and movies of Emory and Henry
games, McLaughlin is obviously im-

 

 

pressed by the way Coach Casto
Ramsey’s Wasps play the game.
“They’re big, but that’s not what
bothers me the most,” says Mc-
Laughlin. “It’s the way the carry
the game to the team they’re play-
ing. They hit hard, and keep hitting.”

Stand-Outs

McLaughlin singled out All-State
end Levi Otey, fullback C. A. Bur-
ton, halfbacks Harry Yost and Bob-
by Magill, and freshman quarterback
Randy Atkinson as the key men in
the Wasp attack.

The general situation for Sat-
urday’s game is much the same as
it was last year at mid-season for
W&L. The Generals have won four
games and are unbeaten, they’re
facing the team they feel will give
them their toughest test, and its
Parents’ Weekend, just as it was
last year when Johns Hopkins came
to town. The Jays were unbeaten,
and stayed that way holding the
Generals to an 8-8 tie. The Wasps
aren’t unbeaten, but they’ve won
four straight.

Coach McLaughlin expects his
squad to be in good physicial con-

150-yard medley and the 200-yard
freestyle.

Phi Kap captured its only first
place as James won the 50-yard
freestyle in 24.1 seconds. Pete Pres-
ton of Phi Psi was second in 25.0
seconds.

The 100-yard butterfly was one
of the closest races of the schedule
as Dick Warwick of Delt put on
a finishing spurt to edge Phi Psi’s
Walt McManus. The winning time
was 1:06.4.

Nick Monsarrat, Delt, won the
100-yard feestyle in 57.2 seconds.
SAE Will williams was second, only
one second off the pace.

In the 100-yard backstroke, frosh
Broaddus of Sigma Chi won easily
as he coasted to the finish in 1:09.0.

KA’s Ship Chase outraced Jackson,
Delt, in the 100-yard breaststroke
to win that event in 1:15.2. Chase
also took the runnerup spot in the
100-yard individual medley.

On October 25 the diving finals
were held with Dave Geer, Phi
Delt, capturing the event. Dick Al-
bert of SAE was second to the win-
ning freshman.

Football

In Division A of the I-M football
program, PiKA remained undefeated
by downing Phi Psi 19-0 on Wed-
nesday, October 25. Nicky Smith led
the way for the victors as he scored
on a six yard run and passed 40
yards for a T-D. Senior Bev Dubose
accounted for the other score as he
raced 30 yards for the final points in
the fourth period.

Also on Wednesday, Beta downed
KA 7-0, but the results are not of-
ficial because a protest has been
field. A decision will soon be hand-
ed down by the I-M Board.

Delta Upsilon and Sigma Chi both
won their contests on October 24.
Sigma Chi kept its record unblem-
ished by easily upending SPE 28-7.

In the closest game of the season
DU edged ZBT 7-6. On the first play
from scrimmage, Jim Conrad inter-
cepted a ZBT pass and raced 70
yards untouched for the initial score.
The important PAT was good on a
roll-out to senior Pete Conrad. Fol-
lowing DU’s kickoff, Art Sher took
a lateral and raced 60 yards for the
final points of the game with three
minutes remaining in the first period.

In their opening game of the sea-
son, ZBT overran a unit from Pi
Phi, 19-0. Sophomore Bill Solmson
was Outstanding as he hit his left
end for two perfect TD tosses.

benefit greatly; for there is more
to this racial problem than meets
the eye. Newspapers don’t tell the
whole story. King could enlighten
us. I don’t see how the Board could
think this way.”

Ken Boiarsky: “I don’t see any
reason why King shouldn’t be
allowed to come here. This event
has shown that it ought to be
more clearly defined by the school
who should be able to come here
and who should not.”

Frank Wright: “A lot of bad opin-
ion and earnest criticism will come
from this decision. I think King
should be allowed to come here,
especially since he would have to
speak on a defined topic.”

Ray Robrecht: “I was sorry to see
the decision because I think it has
really shaken the confidence of
the student body in the University.
This insults the intelligence of the
students. I agree with the stand
taken on this matter by the Ring-
tum Phi.

No student could be found who
really supported the action of the
Board of Trustees. The many op-
ponents of King in the student body
favored giving him a chance to
speak and wanted to hear his views.

The topic continues to be the
foremost matter of argument on

we certainly would command his
unquestioned respect and admira-
tion. Yet, this is not the case. I
think we would do well to heed his
final evaluation of our attitude and
not just brush it off, saying he is
bitter and jealous of us.

“Americans think they are the
greatest nation in the world be-
cause of their living standards.
They judge all other people by
their own standards and do not
try to comprehend another way
of life, which may be far superior
to theirs. They must learn to take
criticism and not be flattered by
people who may be trying to use
them. Americans must take a sec-
ond look at themselves, especially
when they are in a foreign coun-
try; they must realize that the
U. S. has made a lot of mistakes
and that they have not been right
in everything they have done.”

22 Students Selected For 196

1,050 Parents
Make Weekend
Largest Yet

A record of 1050 parents
and guests, over 125 more
than last year, attended the
seventh annual Parents’ Week-
end.

This figure includes the par-
ents of 491 students, repre-
senting 46 per cent of the
student body. A total of 1255
people were served at the Par-
ents’ Day luncheon Saturday.
In comparison, last year had
921 parents and guests, with
440 sets of parents represent-
ing 40 per cent of the student

body.

The weekend began with regis-
tration Friday morning and termi-
nated with the Glee Club Concert
Saturday night. Activities got under-
way Friday afternoon with a meet-
ing of the Parents’ Advisory Coun-
cil in Evans Dining Hall, with Rich-
ard T. Evans of Roanoke as Chair-
man. At the meeting, Sherwood
Wise (W&L ’32), Jaskson, Mississip-
pi, was elected to succeed Mr. Ed-
wards as next year’s chairman of
the 50-member organization. Dr.
Joseph McDaniel, Jr., Pineville, Pa.,
was elected vice-chairman.

Highlighting the activities Friday
night were the public faculty dis-
cussions on major topics of current
events. In Lee Chapel, Dr. Leon F.
Sensabaugh and Dr. Charles W.
Turner, both professors of history,
discussed “Leftist Movements in
South America and the Economic
Stakes.” Dr. Sensabaugh discussed
the historial nature of the Com-
munist movement in South America,
pointing out how it began in labor
unions and grew into the profes-
sional classes.

Dr. Milton Colvin, associate pro-
fessor of political science, and Dr.
Thomas P. Hughes, associate pro-
fessor of history, talked about
“Berlin: A Problem for the West.”
This was held in duPont Auditorium.
Dr. Colvin in his discussion favored
the firm stand taken by the West
on Berlin. He felt that the loss of
Berlin would mean the end of NATO
and of all American influence in
Europe. Dr. Hughes emphasized the
threat of major world conflict which
the economic ambitions of Russia
have imposed on the world situation.

The annual “Report to Parents”
by university administrative officers
was given Saturday morning. The
program opened with a talk by stu-
dent body president Andrew W.
McThenia, Jr., of Alderson, West

Tuesday Edition

Keep Assimilation Committee Until Dress Becomes Tradition

The furor that has recently developed over Washington with the recent Board of Trustees’ decision to ban Dr. Mar-
and Lee’s Assimilation Committee is indicative of what we like | tin Luther King from speaking here.

to believe represents a new trend of thought on this campus.

The Friday Edition of the Ring-tum Phi has devoted two
editorials concerning abolishing the Assimilation Committee,
while Steve Rutledge, chairman of that organization, has an-
swered one of these editorials in a letter that was published

last Tuesday.

The Tuesday Edition, feeling that perhaps still an-
other side exists to this problem of assimilation, is of the
opinion that our position should be given consideration
by the students, the Assimilation Committee members,
and the members of the Executive Committee.

We do not, and never will, advocate a complete
abolishment of the Assimilation Committee: as long as
conventional dress is regarded as being a tradition that is
given only lip service by the Student Body.

We hold the belief that with the situation as it exists now,
the Assimilation Committee is “a necessary but an evil func-
tion.” To abolish that Committee with one fell swoop at the
present time would be a drastic mistake—a mistake that Wash-
ington and Lee would regret for many years.

It further is our opinion that this Committee is a prerequi-
site for the successful enforcement of the freshman assimi-
lation rules. Perhaps the Assimilation Committee’s rules, as
they stand now, are out of tune with the new thought that has
developed on this campus; and, perhaps, in due time these
rules possibly could be done away with all together.

We do not want to see the Assimilation Committee abol-
ished by a drastic decision that could harm Washington and
Lee’ s reputation. That reputation already has been hurt enough

: 3 Sees ae : :

 

Conventional dress deserves to be a real tradition
at Washington and Lee. This University’s heritage and
its name have both had their success, even if in only a
very small way, attributed to her “traditions.”

We are not going to argue the “hows” and ‘‘whys”
of W&L should look nice—that’s already been said
and attacked. Our reason for wanting to see conven-
tional dress continued is because, as Mr. Rutledge put
it, Washington and Lee might “‘be reduced to the
status of another ordinary college.”’

Washington and Lee is by no means an ordinary Uni-
versity. This University does stand apart from other schools,
and we feel that it would be a blow to tear down what repu-
tations we still have. In short, we believe that any action
taken without due consideration to our status and to our herit-
age would indeed be a step in the wrong direction.

We can, however, see the other side of this case. It is
indeed a hollow tradition that has to be enforced. ‘‘Tradition
suggests—never dictates,” one writer has said. With the above
quote in mind, does it not seem silly to enforce a rule by means
of a police-like committee that forces us to “look nice?”

If conventional dress were a real tradition at W&L, a tra-
dition as cherished as our Honor System or our way of life
here, then there would be little work for the Assimilation
Committee to do. Unfortunately this situation does not exist.

We, therefore, challenge this Student Body to give

a sincere answer to this question: “DOES WASHING.

TON AND LEE WANT TO ABOLISH CONVEN.

Troubadours’ First Production,

‘Boy Meets Girl

By MAC McCLUNG
Tuesday Reviewer

not-so-calm, producer whose new
film is shown during the play and

The Troubadour Theater’s first
production of the 1961-62 season,
Boy Meets Girl, is a delightful
comedy in three acts by Bella and
Samuel Spewack. First produced for
a long run on broadway in 1935, the
play has been rewritten and up-
dated and is as clever a satire of

quarter of a century ago. In its
representation of life in a Holly-
wood studio, it doesn’t leave a stone
unturned, making the topsy-turvy
world of the film hilariously chaotic.

Considering the size of the cast—
eighteen—and the fact that many
of the members of the cast are mak-
ing their stage debut, that the play
contains a technical innovation
which the Troubs haven’t tried be-
fore, and that the play itself will
drag noticeably if its rapid pace is
broken, the Troubs are to be com-
mended for what they have done.

In the first act the play builds
to roaring pace which is maintained
throughout, and the moments of re-
lief, needed to provide a rest from
the comic tension which the play
sparks, are well-played. The action
and staging are smooth, the lines
well-delivered, and the character-
izations excellent throughout.

Reservations for Boy Meets Girl
may be made by calling HO 3-2181,
and asking for Extension 273 or
the Troubadour Theater, from
three to five and six to eight p.m.

play Law and Benson, the two hack

sonified cliche. Phil Booth is equal-

We hope that the answer will be a loud and a very
clear ‘““NO!”’; and from knowing the character of this
University’s students, we can predict that the answer
to this challenge will be negative.

The following proposals sum up what we feel represents
our side to this assimilation question. We realize, quite frank-
ly, that these suggestions are by no means perfect: they simply
represent one organization’s opinion. We feel sure that there
are other beliefs about this matter which are held by students
and faculty members. We encourage these opinions and will
honor each and every one of them. We would propose the fol-
lowing:

(1) Conventional dress should be limited to the
campus of Washington and Lee, and that mode of
dress should be encouraged to be worn in and around
Lexington.

(2) For the present time, the Assimilation Com-
mittee should be continued with emphasis being placed
on a stricter enforcement of the freshman rules, and to
an enforcement of assimilation rules only on the cam-
pus.

(3) The Executive Committee, with the help of the
Assimilation Committee, should conduct a study on the
possibility of limiting the Committee’s jurisdiction
to only the freshman rules. This study should be made
only after a general “tapering off’ of assimilation of
upperclassmen is undertaken. The records of the As-
similation Committee, such as the number of upper-
classmen not in conventional dress for a specified period
of time, should dictate the feasibility of this ‘tapering
off” policy.

(4) Include in any results or findings by the Execu-
tive Committee the stipulation that if after the dress
rules are no longer under strict enforcement, and only
if the appearance gets out of hand on campus, then the
Executive Committee, by recommendation of public
opinion and student reaction, will reactivate the Assimi-
lation Committee to take their former position on the
rules of dress.

(5) Encourage the student body to accept con-
ventional dress as being a real tradition: not a rule that

 

ments.

‘Snug Harbor At Lexington’

(Editor’s note: The following editorial appear-
ed in the October 25, 1961 issue of the Richmond
News Leader. We are reprinting it because of its
particular significance to the recent denial by the
Board of Trustees of the Washington and Lee stu-
dent body’s right of free inquiry.)

A few days ago, the Washington and Lee trus-
tees issued an order prohibiting the Rev. Martin
Luther King from speaking on the Lexington cam-
pus. The decision reversed a faculty recommen-
dation that King be invited to speak at a meeting
of the University Christian Association.

The trustees’ decision seems to us regrettable.
From time to time, Northern institutions of higher
learning regularly invite Southern spokesmen to
their campuses. Bill Simmons, director of the Mis-
sissippi Citizens Council, spoke at Elmira College
in New York; and though some students walked
out on him, he did manage to present a point of
view. Tom Waring, editor of the Charleston News
& Courier, lectures frequently north of the Poto-
mac. The late John Temple Graves, of Birming-
ham, was a familiar figure on Northern campuses.

Such institutions as Harvard, Cornell, Villa-
nova, Amherst, and Dartmouth have not hesitated
to give a hearing to Southern segregationists and

      

defenders of States’ Rights. Files of the Virginia
Commission on Constitutional Government show
that the Commission’s publications are being used
in dozens of Northern college classrooms.

To be sure, the Northern institutions seldom
give the Southern point of view a fifty-fifty break;
the custom is to rack up three liberal speakers
against one conservative, and later to turn the
liberal students loose for barbed questions to their
guest. In theory, these institutions hold that all
responsible views are equal; in practice, some are
more equal than others.

Southern institutions of higher learning, sad
to say, generally have lagged behind their Northern
cousins in tolerating conflicting points of view.
Randolph-Macon once invited Oliver Hill to speak
to the students; some of the college’s more intoler-
ent critics raised a terrible uproar. If other qualified
Negroes have been invited to defend their point of
view before predominantly white Southern institu-
tions, it has escaped our notice.

In this connection, one’s personal opinion of
Martin Luther King—or of Thurgood Marshall or
Roy Wilkins or Clarence Mitchell—is beside the
point. Admire them or despise them, they are
eminently qualified to discuss the Negroes’ posi-

   

tion on one of the great social issues of our time.
They are shrewd, intelligent, and widely experi-
enced; they have participated at first hand in revo-
lution.

If an educational institution does not expose
its students to qualified authority, how can it ex-
pect to teach effectively? Young minds must be
given an opportunity to explore for themselves, to
hear different points of view responsibly presented,
to test the blades of their own opinions in intel-
lectual duels with skilled antagonists. This is how
men learn; this is how minds grow.

“Let the winds of doctrine be let loose to play
upon the earth,” cried Milton. “Let Truth and
Falsehood grapple: who ever knew Truth put to
the worse in a free and open encounter?”

An institutional policy that seeks to shelter stu-
dents from conflicting winds of doctrine in the end
is self-defeating. Sailors cannot learn to cope with
a gale by soft exercises in a placid harbor.

A PASSING THOUGHT ...

What happened to justice in the Trus-
tees’ decision to ban Martin Luther King;
the effect of which denied Washington and
Lee students the right of free i in uiry?

   

  

Parents’ Weekend Successful -- Even With Parents

After last week’s serious and supposedly dignified
attempt to direct criticism toward what has been affec-
tionately labelled as “Topic A”, it’s pretty hard to come
back down to the usual level of petulant satire.

In the first place, “Topic A” is still of importance,
and in the second, there’s hardly anything else that
happened this week to write about. Except that there
were an awful lot of tourists on campus this past
weekend.

So I'll spend this column telling all the il-
legitimate students whose parents didn’t show up
what happened.

First of all there was the problem of eating. Friday
night was worse than Saturday night of a VMI
weekend. That is, Friday night was worse than any of
those other nights if you were trying to get into any

resturant in the vicinity. If you were trying to get
served then it was about the same as any night, and
a little better than last Tuesday. The food everywhere
was usual.

A really revealing little session was held at nine at
the President’s home. Dr. and Mrs. Cole were at home,
and so were several thousand other people in Lexing-
ton. But the out-of-towners seemed to be flocking
to the house beside Traveller’s last home, so I took
my parents there too.

Anybody who hasn’t seen that pad should stop by
some afternoon. (Carry a camera, wear a beret, smoke
a cigar and make touristy remarks like “Wow! Look at
this, Elmira!” and you can make it.) Do not go as a stu-

dent. Graduate and go as an alumnus. But go some-
time. One thing which should be noticed by all is
the cashmere rug in one room, Somewhere somebody

killed an awful big cashmere to get a skin that big.

Saturday was the same all over. Professors
gave glowing reviews to keep that tuition com-
ing in. “There’s always a little room for im-
provement,” is a really good line. Here I will
digress and give thanks to all my professors
who contained themselves with that line.

I skipped the report to the Parents given in the
Gym in the new gum chairs on the refinished gym
floor where no smoking is allowed except at basket-
ball games, so I really don’t know if they used the
scratchy old record to kick things off.

This points out the need for the University’s
membership in the Columbia Record Club. And I
couldn’t get a comment on the proceedings from
my parents because they sat in Lee Chapel during

this time—mesmerized by the glowing words of one of
the Lee-ettes as she told mother all about old R.E.

Everybody knows about the football game, and
since my father’s alma mater is having a rough year
he was happy to be on the winning side.

The cocktail party was a different story. Here
is where all the good effects of the day were washed
away, and all the bad effects too. Professors, admin-
istrators, parents, sons and dates, all gathered under
one roof to relax and to try to demonstrate what
really goes on. Without combos this was a flop—but
the liquor was good, the conversation scintillating,
and the mood mellow.

Parents’ Weekend should come more often, and
even with parents its lots of fun. Come back often,
parents, and when you can’t make it, send money.

W&L Smashes Emory, 27-6

By JOHN ALLGOOD

Assisting Managing Editor

Early in the second period
it looked like it was going to
be a long, cold day Saturday
at Wilson Field.

Emory and Henry, which
had just pulled within two
points of W&L’s undefeated
Generals was _ threatening
again.

A moment later the entire pic-
ture changed. E&H freshman flash
Bobby Magill, who had sparked
the Wasps’ attack for nearly two
periods, crashed into 200-pound
W&L guard Bob Payne and fell
limply to the turf. Magill was

helped off the field and didn’t re-
turn.

With Magill’s departure, Emory
and Henry’s offense skidded to a
screaching stop. The Wasps gener-
ated only one more. threat—a
fourth period drive which carried to
the Generals’ five-yard line.

Minus Magill, Emory and Henry
was no match for the Five-Star
Generals who rolled to a 27-6 victory
and their second straight Virginia

 

Chowan Tramples
Frosh Gridders, 50-0

By BILL HILTON
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s fresh-
man football team suffered it’s
worst defeat of the season last
Friday losing to Chowan Jun-
ior College, 50-0.

A small Parents’ Weekend crowd
saw Chowan run the opening kick-
off back 85 yards for a touchdown
and then added six more tallies be-
fore the final gun sounded.

CJC’s second score came after a
68-yard march in fifteen plays on
a one-yard end run. A two point
conversion was successful.

Two touchdowns were added in
the second quarter as the visitors
capitalized on a W&L fumble and
an intercepted pass.

In the third period Chowan block-
ed a W&L punt on the Baby Gen-
erals’ 10-yard line and scored two
plays later. In the final minutes of
the third period another W&L punt
was blocked and in several plays
Chowan had added their sixth
touchdown.

The final quarter saw the powerful
Chowan line smother the Baby Gen-

 

Grid Star Dies

Onetime Washington and Lee foot-
ball star Edward Arthur (Jiggs)
Donahue of Weston, Mass., died
Sunday in the New England Baptist
Hospital in Boston, according to a
report today by the Associated Press.

and quarterback of W&L’s 1914 foot-
ball team.

their last touchdown of the after-
noon.
Big Line

Throughout the game the smaller
W&L line had trouble containing
Chowan. Outweighed by 25 pounds
per man the Baby Generals were
unable to play effectively on offense
or defense.

The running of Billy David, W&L
halfback, was the offensive bright
spot all afternoon.

* Washington and Lee scored once

 

in each period in a game that was
predominately a punter’s duel.

Fullback Tommy Keesee put the
Generals ahead, 6-0, when he
burst 10 yards up the middle with
:30 left in the first period.
Charlie Gummey ran the two-
point conversion,

Little All-American center Terry
Fohs, who played his second superb
game in a row, set up the touchdown
when he recoverd a E&H fumble at
the Wasps’ 39-yard line. Gummey
accounted for nearly half the yard-
age to the goal line with 15 yards
in two carries.

After a punting interlude, Magill
started his talent show.

The speedy halfback from Rich-
mond gathered in Dan Blain’s punt
on the E&H 21 and dashed 79
yards down the right sidelines for
the Wasps’ lone touchdown. A pass
for the tying two-point conversion

failed.

But Magill wasn’t through.
Three plays later he picked off a
Steve Suttle pass at the E&H 45
and scooted to the W&L 21. With
Magill running wild, the Wasps’
deadly sting hovered over W&L.
What the Generals needed was

an antedote. And they had—Payne—
but they didn’t know it.

Payne, who played his usual hard,
steady game, removed the E&H
menace with one jarring tackle.

Emory and Henry tried to con-
tinue their goalward drive, but
Gummey snared a Andy Atkinson
pass at the two and ended the
Wasps’ last serious threat until the
fourth period.

 

A pair of old-time showstoppers
next muscled their way into the
spotlight. Tackle Phil McCaleb
broke through the E&H defenders
and blecked Jim Hughes’ punt at
the Wasps’ 40. Payne picked up
the bouncing ball and sped 30
yards for the second General score.
McCaleb and Payne pulled this
same blocked punt-touchdown
trick last week against Johns
Hopkins.

 

Sports Star Of The Week

Payne Plays
Rugged Tackle
For Generals

“That shark is nothing short of
vicious,” were Coach Lee McLaugh-
lin’s first sentiments when asked
to pick the outstanding player in
W&L’s 27-6 romp over Emory and
Henry Saturday.

The “shark,” referring to tackle
Bob Payne, a Delt junior, not only
picked up a blocked punt which
he ran thirty yards for a touchdown
but also was the sole cause of what
Jerry Linquist, a Richmond Times-
Dispatch sports writer, called “the
turning point of the game.”

The turning point referred to oc-
curred in the second quarter when
Payne racked up Bobby Magill, the
Wasp’s backfield ace who had al-
ready scored one touchdown and had
intercepted a Steve Suttle pass, to
such an extent that Magill was
forced to leave the game for good.

Saturday’s game marked the
second week in succession in
which Payne has figured in the
Generals’ scoring. Against Johns
Hopkins last week, he picked up
a blocked punt and scampered
eight yards for a tally.

Coach Mac added that Payne has
yet to have a bad game. “He’s
done a real fine job both offensively
and defensively for us this season.”

While maintaining a Dean’s List
average, Payne is managing editor
of the Calyx, is a member of the
Assimilation Committee, vice-presi-
dent of the junior class and was a
vice-president of this year’s opening
Dances.

The second half was all Washing-
ton and Lee as the offense and de-
fense took turns sharing the glory.

W&L’s brick wall defense repelled
E&H drives at the W&L 5, 32, 39,
and 48-yard lines.

Meanwhile, the Generals’ offense
rolled long distances for two touch-
downs.

Fullback Doug Martin’s one-
yard plunge ended a 60-yard
march in the third period and
halfback Dave Tharp’s one-yard
drive climaxed a 52-yard drive
in the final period.

Martin, halfback Jim Hickey, and
sophomore standout Stu Yoffe took
turns slashing through the Wasps’
defense in the third-period march.

Yoffe started the jaunt when he
took a Hughes’ punt on the W&L
five and dashed back to the W&L 40
where the last E&H defender be-
tween him and the goal line pulled
him down.

Yoffe carried the ball three times
during the drive, twice twisting
and stiff arming his way to two
needed first downs. He picked up

19 yards in the drive

But Martin and Hickey ripped off
the long, spectacular runs Hickey,
the “South Boston flash,” raced 19
yards down the left sidelines for a
first down at the 26 and Martin drove
16 yards on a draw play to the one.

Yoffe and Keesee were the big
guns in the fourth period excursion.
Yoffe ate up 15 yards in two carries
and Keesee ground out 23 yards in
five tries.

Fohs played another outstanding
game on defense. The “tiny” package
of might made 19 tackles, several of
which would have resulted in E&H
touchdowns had he missed them.

HUSBANDS, ANYONE?

It has been alleged that coeds go to college for the sole purpose
of finding husbands. This is, of course, an infamous canard, and
I give fair warning that, small and spongy as I am, anybody
who says such a dastardly thing when I am around had better
be prepared for a sound thrashing!

Girls go to college for precisely the same reasons as men do:
to broaden their horizons, to lengthen their vistas, to drink at
the fount of wisdom. But, if, by pure chance, while a girl is
engaged in these meritorious pursuits, a likely looking husband
should pop into view, why, what’s wrong with that? Eh? What’s
wrong with that?

The question now arises, what should a girl look for in a
husband. A great deal has been written on this subject. Some
say character is most important, some say background, some
say appearance, some say education. All are wrong.

The most important thing—bar none—in a husband is health.
Though he be handsome as Apollo and rich as Midas, what good
is he if he just lays around all day accumulating bedsores?

The very first thing to do upon meeting a man is to make
sure he is sound of wind and limb. Before he has a chance to
sweet-talk you, slap a thermometer in his mouth, roll back his
eyelids, yank out his tongue, rap his patella, palpate his thorax,
ask him to straighten out a horseshoe with his teeth. If he fails
these simple tests, phone for an ambulance and go on to the
next prospect.

If, however, he turns out to be physically fit, proceed to the
second most important requirement in a husband. I refer to a
sense of humor.

A man who can’t take a joke is a man to be avoided. There
are several simple tests to find out whether your prospect can
take a joke or not. You can, for example, slash his tires. Or burn
his “Mad” comics. Or steal his switchblade. Or turn loose his
pet raccoon. Or shave his head.

After each of these good-natured pranks, laugh gaily and
shout “April Fool! If he replies, “But this is February nine-
teenth,” or something equally churlish, cross him off your list
and give thanks you found out in time.

But if he laughs silverly and calls you “Little Minx!” put
him to the next test. Find out whether he is kindly.

 

Wat sboalfton/ Vena eid ?

The quickest way to ascertain his kindliness is, of course, to
look at the cigarette he smokes. Is it mild? Is it clement? Is it
humane? Does it minister tenderly to the psyche? Does it
coddle the synapses? Is it a good companion? Is it genial? Is
it bright and friendly and filtered and full of dulcet pleasure
from cockcrow till the heart of darkness?

Is it, in short, Marlboro?

If Marlboro it be, then clasp the man to your bosom with
hoops of steel, for you may be sure that he is kindly as a sum-
mer breeze, kindly as a mother’s kiss, kindly to his very marrow.

And now, having found a man who is kindly and healthy
and blessed with a sense of humor, the only thing that remains
is to make sure he will always earn a handsome living. That,
fortunately, is easy. Just enroll him in engineering.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

BY DON WALLIS
Assistant Sports Editor

Of all the many “popular images” prevalent today, the one iden-
tified with Madison Avenue—referring to the vast world of advertis-
ing and mass media—is certainly the most vivid.

One is generally considered to be Madison Avenue if he (1) wears
his Ivy League clothing in various states of casualness, and (2)
approaches the world with an all-wise, “Yes-I-know-all-about-it”
attitude (which may also be termed “Ivy League”).

A young man named Walter Bingham fits perfectly into this
Madison Avenue pattern, as well he should—he is, in fact Madison
Avenue, being one of eight associate editors for the highly-regarded
Sports Illustrated magazine. It might even be said that Mr. Bing-
ham goes Madison Avenue one step better—he wears his Ivy League
clothes (complete with red and black pin-striped, button-down
shirt) not so much casually as in a state of slovenly disarray (ex-
amples: half-knotted knit tie, unpressed suit, unlaced cordovans,
and, also, uncombed hair).

All this would be irrelevant here, except for Bingham’s boss, a
man reproached last year by W&L publicity man Frank Parsons for
an SI article condemning non-subsidizations as a collegiate athletic
program. The boss sent Bingham to the W&L campus in search of an
article for this week’s edition, and Mr. B—who, incidentally, bears a
striking resemblance to W&L student Paul Clemenceau and, as
football player Ed Croft pointed out, to “a blond-haired Montgomery
Cliff’—was here Thursday and Friday. A Sports Illustrated photog-
rapher covered the Emory and Henry game Saturday afternoon.

During his two-day stay here, Bingham chatted with several uni-
versity figures and coaches, lunched at the Delt house, enjoyed a
small party at Coach Lee MacLaughlin’s home, forming his general
impressions of W&L’s athletic policy in this informal manner.

“I’m mainly going to write about the history of the last ten years—
from the time of the real good teams, through the de-emphasis, to
the present unbeaten teams. My style is not to offer an opinion; I
won't say that I think it’s a great system, or that it is a mistake.
I'll just use a few quotes to bring out each side,” Bingham told us.

“T think I’ll try and make it more interesting with a light, humor-
ous approach. For example, one of the coaches told me that during
the first years of transition, Coach Boyd Williams welcomed a group
of candidates to the opening practice, and yelled ‘All of you boys
out for end, follow me!’ Williams turned and jogged down to the
other end of the field, then turned around to talk with his ends—
and saw just one boy, a little fellow panting for breath.”

We asked about the chances of his article being published. “I'm
glad you asked that. Several people here have said to me that they
are glad I’m here so the magazine will tell how good the system is
at Washington and Lee. Actually, the article may not be published
at all, as is the case with many articles. In fact, the editor who sug-
gested this story is in the hospital and won’t be working this week,
so I'd say there is a good chance that the story won’t get in print.”

Bingham, an extremely frank and candid man, summed his
personal impressions thusly: When I first was assigned to come
down here, they told me to ‘go down and take a look.’ I was pretty
skeptical about the whole deal. Let’s face it, this isn’t exactly a world-
shaking story here. It’s one where I will have to work pretty hard
to make interesting to all our readers.... But, after being here and
seeing what has been done and what is being done at Washington
and Lee—Well I think I may have something for a fairly adequate
article.”

This statement, on its face, is quite non-commital. But coming
from dour, cynical Walter Bingham, it assumes a somewhat different
meaning. It’s even safe to say, perhaps, that the Madison Avenue pro
was impressed—reluctantly impressed, it seemed—with the amateur
approach to athletics. Or rather, the Washington and Lee approach.

Steve Colvin plays a young British

ELLINGTON SIGNED FOR FANCY DRESS

 

Board Petitioned by EC

To Reverse Ban on King

On Tuesday, student body President Andrew McThena,

acting as spokesman for the Executive Committee, forwarded

a letter to members of the Boa
reconsider their decision on Dr

rd of Trustees to urge them to
. Martin Luther King.

The Board was recently requested to permit an invitation
to Dr. King to speak under the auspices of the University

 

SI Lead Story
Lauds W&L
Football Team

Washington and Lee’s un-
defeated football team is made
up of students who like to
play football rather than foot-
ball players who study, Sports
Illustrated associated editor
Walter Bingham says in the
national magazine’s lead story
this week.

Bingham, who visited W&L last
weekend, prior to the Emory and
Henry Parents’ Weekend game,
calls Washington and Lee “the most
successful of all schools in Ameri-

ca that have de-emphasized their
athletic programs.”
History

Bingham traced the history of
W&L from the ’Gator Bowl team
of 1950 to the present undefeated
squad, telling in detail the reasons
for subsidization being dropped by
the university.

“The football players, on the
whole, were proving scholastically
inferior” during the subsidized years,
says Bingham, but the university
might not have dropped its scholar-
ship program if “a large portion of
the football team had not been
caught cheating during the final
exams of 1954.”

Lean Years

Included in the ten-year history
are anecdotes from what Bingham
calls the “lean years” at W&L, when
victories were few and far between,
and spectators numbered in the
teens.

The miserable results of the lean
years caused many alumni and stu-
dents to favor a return to subsidiza-

 

McCrum’s Drug Store, which ordi-
narily piles up a whopping sale of
“10 or 12 copies of Sports Illustrated
a week,” ordered 550 copies of the
national sporting magazine _ this
week.

By yesterday afternoon, 475 copies
had been scooped up—the biggest
magazine boom in Lexington history.

 

tion, but the University and the
Board of Trustees held their posi-
tion of no financial support for ath-
letes.

“There were like a bunch of little
kids who had their red wagon taken
away,” Bingham quotes one present
member of the General squad as
saying in a reference to the alumni.

Chipley

When the University fired Head
Coach Bill Chipley in 1956, after
W&L won only one game, it looked
as if the powers-that-be might be
contemplating at least a partial re-
turn to emphasis on athletics, says
Bingham, but the University con-
tended that it had released Chipley
because he was not “a good teacher
of football.

In 1957, Lee McLaughlin took over
the reins of the General football
coaching staff—a position he still
occupies.

Frustration

Bingham analyzes the problems
faced by McLaughlin in recruiting,
when he has nothing to offer the
boys “except a good education.”

“Recruiting here is like selling in-
surance,” McLaughlin told Bingham.
“You see a thousand boys, maybe
you get ten.”

McLaughlin’s efforts, his first two
terms as General head coach were

KChristian Association. The request
was forwarded to the Board mem-
bers with a recommendation for
approval by the faculty committee.
The Board denied the request.

The Executive Committee’s letter
gives an account of the student
body’s strong opinion against the re-
fusal to permit the invitation.

The EC continues by saying, “Al-
though concerned with the immedi-
ate problem of refusing to allow the
Rev. King to be invited to speak, we
feel that the issues presented here
have a broader implication. Such re-
strictions upon academic freedom is
both damaging to the general repu-
tation of the University and more
definitely to the morale of the stu-
dents in attendance.”

The letter quotes from the Wash-
ington and Lee Catalogue which says
the University will apply the “dem-
ocratic form, the accepted American
form, of social organization.” The
statement adds that W&L is dedi-
cated “to the liberty of the mind
with its attendant right of inquiry.”

Finally the letter states that the
spirit and freedom of the expression
of ideas should not be limited and
restricted, “that an airing of contro-
versial questions and opinions is
necessary to further the search for
truth.”

A petition, sponsored by Protest,
has also been circulated on campus.
The purpose has been to call to the
attention of the Board of Trustees
the feeling of antagonism that has
arisen from their decision among
the students. The appeal is for a re-
consideration by the members of the
Board, and a reversal of their origi-
nal decision.

The Student Bar Association, rep-
resenting the Law School students,
has indicted the Board of Trustees
for “such infamous rulings.”

Parents’ Council Discussion

The activities of last weekend did
not prevent the matter of Dr. King
from being discussed. The Parents’
Advisory Council was advised of
the existing situation.

After considerable discussion it
was concluded that in as much as
permission to extend the invitation
to Dr. King was sought from the
Trustees by joint faculty-student
committee, no question of academic
freedom was involved. The sugges-
tion was made that the procedure
used to gain permission from the
Board was unusual but under the
circumstances the decision was made
with authority and without breach
of the right of inquiry.

 

Billy Butterfield Signed
For Hollins Cotllion Dec. 2

Billy Butterfield, the McCoy
Brothers orchestra, and the Four
Voices will be the musical highlights
of this year’s Hollins Cotillion, De-
cember 1-2.

Two formal dances, a concert, open
house in the dormitories, a buffet
supper and Sunday brunch are the
major events of the weekend.

Butterfield will play at a dance
from 8 to 12 Saturday night in the
Hotel Roanoke ballroom.

For the McCoy Brothers, it will be
a return engagement as they play-
ed for the Saturday night dance at
last year’s Cotillion weekend.

“The enthusiasm for their per-
formance was so great that we decid-
ed to contract them again,” said
Peggy Williams, Cotillion Club pres-
ident. “Everybody seemed to like
them better than Buddy Morrow,”
she said.

The four Voices will sing at a
2 p.m. concert on Saturday, backed
by Butterfield and his band. Open
house in the dorms will be held after
the concert, followed by a_ buffet
supper in the Hollins dining room.

 

(Continued on page four)

Sunday morning brunch is from
11:30 to 1:30.

 

Quiz Bowl Team To Appear
On Roanoke TV Sunday

The W&L College Bowl team
will appear on “College on Camera”
Sunday, at 1:00 p.m. on WDBJ-TV,
channel 7, Roanoke. The program
was taped last Tuesday evening. Mrs.
John Aldridge, wife of a Hollins
professor, conducted the interview.

Mr. Frank Parsons, the team
coach, described the selection of the
team and the preparations for the
College Bowl program. The four reg-
lar and two alternate members of
the team were interviewed and asked
questions similar to those asked on
the College Bow! program.

The team will continue practicing
with the use of the buzzer to in-
crease each member’s efficiency and
alertness. The skill of most import-
ance to the team at the moment is
to feel the pace of the show and then
to work up to it. The members have
been listening to tapes of the College
Bowl program in order to get the
pace. This also familiarizes the team

 

with the voice of Allen Luden, the
moderator.

Although strong in most categor-
ies commonly covered in quiz bowl
questions, the W&L team is weak in
science because there are no science
majors on the team. Another weak-
ness may develop because none of
the members are familiar with pro-
grams on television.

The team is being coached in its
knowledge of modern concepts in
the field of art by Dr. Marion Jun-
kin. The team’s strong points are in
literature, philosophy, history, myth-
ology, music, and current events.

When asked about Pomona, the
possible W&L opponent, Mr. Parsons
said, “They are highly qualified and
a good group of men.” The match
this Sunday between Amherst and
Pomona will determine which col-
lege the W&L team will face. Mr.
Parsons feels that our team is strong
no matter who the opponent.

 

Four Students Get Lee Grants
For Psychological Research

During the 1961-1962 school year,
four Washington and Lee students
will be actively engaged in carry-
ing out certain psychological re-
search projects. The experiments
are being supported through grants
from the Robert E. Lee Research
Fund.

John Harcourt is doing research
in the problems of verbal learning.
He will test experimentally some of
the variables that determine the
amount and rate of learning. Har-
court is working under the guid-
ance of Dr. Leonard Jarrard. Mem-
bers of the student body will be
used as “guinea pigs” in the exper-
iment, which will involve the pres-
entation of certain “nonsense sylla-
bles” to the student and the test-
ing of his powers of rentention un-
der varying conditions.

Wally Thulin will continue re-
search on the behavioral effects of
ionizing radiations on white mice.
The purpose of this research is to
determine the minimum amount of
radiation that will result in changes

 

 

IFC To Give
Beer For Blood

Students who didn’t give blood
because of hour quizzes this week
will get another chance—for charity
this time—when the Red Cross
Bloodmobile comes here Monday for
the Interfraternity Council Blood
Drive. The fraternity with the great-
est number of donors gets a keg of
beer for its efforts.

Donor cards were distributed in
the fraternities this week. They are
also available in the Co-op.

The Bloodmobile will be at the
Student Union from 10 am. to
4 p.m. Monday, according to IFC
Blood Drive chairman Pete Alford.

 

Fall Collegian To Appear
Nov. 18: Civil War Issue

The Southern Collegian Openings
issue’s delayed release this year was
due to an unavoidable delay in the
printing of some full-color adver-
tisements. Although the magazine
has now been completed, its release
is being delayed until November 18,
the date of a home football game.

These ads were printed in Chicago
and mailed to Lexington too late for
the Collegian to be released on time.

The theme for the issue is the
Southern Collegian’s celebration of
the Civil War Centennial. The truth
behind such great encounters as
Pickett’s Charge, Fort Sumter, and
the battle between the Monitor and
the Merrimac is revealed for the
first time.

Editor Roger Paine says the Col-
legian “will, of course, include all
the usual tripe.”

Copies of the issue were removed
from the print shop and are under
lock-and-key until the release date.

 

in performance in an operant con-
ditioning situation.

If performance in this situation
does not prove to be sensitive to
radiation exposure, then this proce-
dure can be used to determine the
effectiveness of various chemical
agents in decreasing damage caused
by such radiations. The practical
results of the experiment could be
in developing a form of protection
for human beings in the event of
nuclear war.

Don Stubbs is doing experimen-
tation to determine the effects of
drive in learning. Several hypothe-
ses developed by psychologists Hull
and Spence will be tested.

The role of motivation in learn-
ing is being studied by Mark White-
head. Motivation factors will be con-
trolled by the use of stimulant and
depressant drugs on white rats.

One experiment will be to have
subjects acquire a habit such as
bar pressing for food. After the
rats have learned this task, one
group will be injected with a stimu-
lant, a second with a depressant,
and the third will serve as a con-
trol group. Different theories pre-
dict different reactions under these
conditions. By gathering experimen-
tal data, Whitehead hopes to test
these theories and contribute to the
formulation of a more accurate one.

 

Four Freshmen Debaters
Compete at Wake Forest
In Six Speaking Events

Four freshmen’ debaters left
Thursday morning to compete in
six debates, Thursday and Friday,
at Wake Forest College in Winston-
Salem, N. C., with novices from col-
leges throughout the South.

Professor William W. Chaffin, de-
bate coach, accompanied Steve
Smith, Malcolm Morris, Gay Read-
ing and Tim Vandiver.

Smith and Morris will debate the
negative side and Reading and Van-
diver the positive side of the year’s
topic, “Resolved, that labor unions
should come under the jurisdiction
of anti-trust legislation.”

Vandiver and Readings debated
as a team in the recent four-college
tournament at W&L, scoring a vic-
tory over the University of Rich-
mond.

 

Tickets For VMI-Citadel
Game Are Placed On Sale

Washington and Lee students
will have to shell out four dollars
for a ticket to the VMI-Citadel
game tomorrow afternoon on Wil-
ser field, UNLESS they pick up
a ticket before 12 noon Saturday
at VMI.

Then it'll cost only two dollars
for the game, which may decide
the Southern Conference cham-
pionship.

The game will be broadcast on
WREL.

 

Cheaper Costumes, New Location

For Ball, Head List Of Plans

The Dance Board announced today that Duke Ellington
and his Orchestra will appear here for the 1961 Fancy Dress

Ball on February 2.

Steve Galef, Dance Board president, said that he was sure
that Ellington, and the many innovations in Fancy Dress,
should make this “the most exciting one in the past few years.”

 

Boy Meets Girl,
First Troub Play
Closes Tonight

Boy Meets Girl, the Troub-

adour Theater’s first produc-
tion of the season, goes on
stage at 8:30 tonight for its
final performance.

The play, a comedy about two
Hollywood writers who delight in
playing practical jokes on their
producer, features a special three-
minute film clip shot on location
last week.

Starring in the film is five-month-
old Billy Roberts, who makes his
acting debut as Happy, an unchal-
lenged infant prodigy and_ the
youngest star in movie history.

Happy endangers the stardom of
Larry Toms, the cowboy idol of
the matinee, who should have stayed
on the range. Bruce Whelihan plays
Larry Toms.

Andy Leonard and Gerry Gray,
juniors, play the roles of the two
zany script writers. Their producer,
whom they constantly harrass, is
played by sophomore Phil Booth.

Susie Dunnell portrays Happy’s
mother, a pretty young girl of less-
than-rigid moral convictions.

Dr. Cecil D. Jones, Jr., assistant
professor of fine arts, is directing the
play.

Boy Meets Girl opened Tuesday
evening.

Other major roles include soph-
omore Steve Colvin of Evansville,
Ill, as a young Englishman who can-
not act but still manages to get into
trouble at every turn; senior Ron
Alenstein as a stereo-typed greedy
actor’s agent; and Scott Iacone and
Jim Applebaum as a pair of hack
composers of background music for
films.

In other roles, Yvonne Dickens
plays the  producer’s — secretary;
Wanda Johnson, a _ nurse; Lisa
Tracy, a manicurist; Tom Hampton,
adoctor.

 

Five Students to Represent
W&L at U.N. Conference

Washington and Lee will be rep-
resented by five students at a stu-
dent conference at the United Na-
tions in New York.

Steve Galef, Dave Knight, Bob
Ketchum, Lewis Westefield and John
Paul will attend the American As-
sociation for the United Nations
student conference, “1961: U.N. Year
of Crisis.” The W&L men will attend
panel sessions within the conference
on such topics as the problems of
Chinese representation, African de-
velopment and the U.N., and the role
of the non-aligned nations in inter-
national politics.

The conference lasts from noon
Friday to Saturday afternoon, Nov.
10-11. The highlight of the confer-
ence will be a speech Saturday by
Prime Minister Nehru of India.

 

Ford Times Features
Article by Fishwick

An article about the hill folk of
Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee
by Dr. Marshall W. Fishwick, chair-
man of the department of American
studies here will appear in this
month’s issue of Ford Times.

The stories refers to the super-
stitutions and life of the people and
the terrain of “Conjur Country.”

Dr. Fishwick, the author of sev-
eral books and numerous articles on
southern life, has been a member of
the Washington and Lee faculty
since 1949. He is a native of Roanoke.

Ford Times is published monthly
by Ford Motor Company and is dis-
tributed nationally through its deal-
ers.

The Dance Board and Fancy
Dress president Bill Ide and his vice-
presidents are already at work plan-
ning the weekend. The Dance Board
is awaiting administration decision
to see if the Ball will be held in
Evans Dining Hall.

As the Dance Board announced
this summer, the costumes will be
available at a lower price than in
the past few years. Frank Young,
Dance Board vice-president, is work-
ing out final arrangements with
Oak Hall Costume Company in Roa-
noke. The costumes and theme will
be announced later this month.

Satch Gets Better Offer

Galef explained that Ellington was
booked only after the possibility
of hiring Lous Armstrong and his
Orchestra was ruled out. Armstrong,
who originally planned to appear
at W&L, accepted a four week en-
gagement in San Francisco which
paid considerably more money. As
a result, he will not be available on
the East Coast until February 9,
1962.

“The hiring of the Ellington Or-
chestra will mean that the Dance
Board has more money to spend
on the concert and dance the sec-
ond night of the Fancy Dress
weekend,” said Galef.

The Dance Board also released the
results of the preference poll taken
in the registration line this fall.
Ray Charles was the overwhelming
choice of students. The Dance Board
said that it would do everything
possible to get Charles here. They
have found, however, that booking
agents have sharply increased the
price for Ray Charles and his Or-
chestra during the past year. Galef
said the increased price “presents a
problem.”

Ellington a Veteran

Ellington and his orchestra are
among the best-known in the enter-
tainment field. He has been active
in music for more than 30 years. In
addition to conducting and arrang-
ing the music for his orchestra,,
Ellington is also an accomplished
songwriter.

Washington and Lee students re-
cently had the opportunity to hear
some of Ellington’s songs in the
movie “Paris Blues,” for which he
did the entire score. He has done
the scores for many other movies,
including the prize-winning “Anat-
omy of a Murder.”

Ellington has appeared at the top
jazz festivals in the country and has
toured around the world several
times. He records for Columbia
Records. His LP album, “Ellington at
Newport,” is one of Columbia’s most
consistent best sellers.

 

Dr. Phillips Will Attend

Economic Convention
In Memphis Nov. 10-11

Dr. Charles F. Phillips, Jr., assist-
ant professor of economics here will
attend the annual meeting of the
Southern Economics Association No-
vember 10 and 11 in Memphis, Tenn.

During the sessions of the asso-
ciation, Dr. Phillips will discuss “The
Technological Revolution and Prob-
lems of Regulation,” a paper to be
presented by Prof. James M. Hund
of Emory University, Atlanta.

Dr. Phillips, who joined the
Washington and Lee faculty in
1959, will be the only representative
of the university’s School of Com-
merce and Administration present
for the meeting.

A member of Phi Beta Kappa, Dr.
Phillips received his Ph.D. degree
in 1960 from Harvard University. He
is the author of articles in several
economic and business journals. He
is currently writing on regulatory
problems.

The Southern Economics Associa-
tion includes economies and business
professors in most southern colleges
and universities.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Friday Edition

‘Breeding Dead Lilacs’

In last Friday’s editorial column we made some rather
strong criticisms of Washington and Lee and her administra-
tion. We have had exactly two comments on that editorial—
one from a freshman who asked us if it was true, and a short
defense from a member of the administration who pointed out
that a curriculum study group was meeting now.

The editorial was deliberately one-sided, but we still stand
behind it as a perfectly fair treatment of the situation here. But
the response—and we hardly expected any of the faculty to
write a letter to the editor—has been nil. We think this only
proves that Washington and Lee has an even more fundamental
fault: the University doesn’t care about ideas.

Just yesterday we had a professor tell us in class of a
knowledgeable friend who levelled the same charge at W&L.

Is it true? We are afraid so.

Our professors do a generally fine job of presenting the
facts in their respective subject fields, but they slight the under-
lying controversies, the varying ideas which are the class’s very
raison d’etre.

Facts we know, but how often is there any real argument
about ideas in class, or outside of it? It certainly is not ungentle-
manly to disagree on the interpretation of history or the criti-
cism of literature. And what good are the facts if no one cares
to discuss their meaning, and no one tries to make sense of
them?

Why don’t we have time to come to grips with the big
questions of our day in class? It is our belief that no one can
understand his era unless he makes a sincere effort to make
up his own mind on most important issues of that era. For
those issues represent the tensions and conflicts which will be
used by later historians in describing the history we are living
now.

It is not the place of the Ring-tum Phi to point out specific
instances to prove this point. Any reasonably alert and inter-
ested student or professor should be able to name several ex-
amples right off the bat.

But we are reminded of two remarks that Dr. Nels F. S.
Ferre made last year during the University Religious Confer-
ence. He said:

 

1. “I guess lingusitic analysis is big here.”’
2. “I’m sure you’re in the midst of an argument over Teil-

hard de Chardin.”

No, Dr. Ferre, we’re afraid we didn’t even know what you
were referring to.

The Ring-tum Phi plans to take a larger responsibility in
presenting and discussing some of the important questions with
which we should concern ourselves as students. We have neither
knowledge nor judgment to do much of a job, we fear. But
we're sick and tired of having men like Dr. Beach came down
here and talk about things we haven’t even heard of. We’re

also ashamed.

A Sign Of The Times

“A campus conservative club hasn’t arrived today until it
has its own magazine,”’ says an editorial in this week’s Nation-
al Review. Among the publications lauded is “The Individual-
ist,” published by The Intercollegiate Society of Individualists.

A society for individualists? O lost!

A Pleasant Reminder

We were glad to hear yesterday that Mr. Brady, the Super-
intendent of Buildings and Grounds, will have the bells in
Washington Hall rung if the football team beats Centre tomor-
row.

Ringing the bells after football victories “away from home”’
is an old Washington and Lee tradition. It has always seemed
to be a fine gesture to ring them—reminding people who stay
here in Lexington that the team has chalked up a victory in
hostile territory. And it should be a worthwhile reminder to
the team that there are many people in Lexington waiting to
see how they have upheld W&L’s honor, even though there
be little evidence of support wherever they are playing.

We'll be all ears tomorrow afternoon.

Juggernaut: Panic From ‘Left’? |

(Editors’ Note—This week we initiate a new
series of articles which will review books and
magazine articles of interest to Ring-tum Phi
readers.

Steve Smith, the new assistant news editor
of the Friday edition, reviews a special edition of
The Nation published this week.

Smith is a Sigma Nu freshman from Jackson-
ville, Florida. He was editor of the student news-
paper at duPont High School there, and has
written for the Jacksonville Journal.)

By STEVE SMITH

A combination of Militarism and Big Business is
dominating the United States today, says Fred J.
Cook in his article “JUGGERNAUT: The Warfare
State,” presented in the Oct. 28 issue of The Nation
magazine.

“The military juggernaut, hand-in-glove with in-
dustry, is high-balling along the highway...to...
authoritarian government...” says Cook; he speak
of power “that has come to dominate the nation and
rob the nation’s people both of understanding and
of choice in the fashioning of their destiny.”

Take a “starved and neglected Army,” merge it
with hungry Business and: enter “the military indus-
trial complex;” “War-minded Military and war-orient-
ed Big Business;” all of which produces “the kind of
Prussianized military-industrial concept that produced
Hitler.” Or so says Mr. Cook in his Liberal answer
to “Operation Abolition.”

It is Cook’s view that the years of working together

; during World War II gave the military and business

a link which they have never broken. He feels that
this combination is making the major policy decisions
in America today, regardless of Welfare, caring only
for the Warfare in which they profit. These two powers
are rendered formidable and odious by the “large-scale
fraternization of the Military with the radical Right.”

Cook’s warning of the power of the military-
industrial complex is well-founded; his article
contains a great deal of documentary evidence.

But, as sometimes occurs in the writing of a zealot,
there is a bit of disdain for the conflicting cases and
its interpretation of the details.

For instance, Cook classes the forces that are most
eager for war in the U.S. as “the same forces that
must abhor the Welfare State.” His statement clearly
disreregards the fact that ther are many conservatives
who want neither war nor Federal Welfare status; just
as “Operation Abolition” disregards liberals by calling
everyone who protested against the HUAC in San
Francisco a communist dupe.

A Slap at David Lawrence

The article describes David Lawrence as “represen-
tative of a type of mind that braves the prospect of
world holocaust with a gay insouciance,” certainly a
rank injustice to a respected conservative columnist.
But to Cook it matters only that Lawrence opposed
social legislation from Washington.

Sarcastically Cook spikes all American foreign poli-
cy which has demonstrated any force of firmness—
ringing Russia with air bases, remilitarizing West Ger-
many, holding Quemoy and Matsu, or speaking for
“the jungle fiefs of a primitive people like the Lao-

tians.” He is unbelievably, opposed to these stands in
favor of “the negotiatory spirit.”

Sabotage at Geneva?

Cook goes on to attack U.S. disarmament policy.
Far from criticizing the Reds, he states that America’s
militaristic forces have “resorted to distortions and de-
ceit, even to outright lies in their determination to
sabotage any possibility of agreement at Geneva.”

They were able to do this through the coopera-
tion of “the Military, the Atomic Energy Com-
mission, and the mass media information—a
trinity that never had desired an end to the arms
race.”

The article closes wtih a vitriolic bath of denuncia-
tion for the Right. Cook says that “when we hear...
a Goldwater sound the siren trumpet... they mean the
total incineration of the world.” He swings at “the
House Un-American Activities Committee, the John
Birch Society, fundamentalists churches, reservists,
chambers of commerce, PTA’s, trade unions, busi-
ness groups, and service clubs” for the showing of
“Operation Abolition.” Then, having tied all these at-
tacks in with his Militaristic Domination theme, and
having run out of vulnerable whipping-boys, he con-
cludes on the same note.

“A Frightening Case”

In spite of his intolerance of certain facts and
of members of the opposition, and his refusal to
admit that anyone with views contrary to his
own could reach a desirable goal, Cook presents a
frightening case.

He begins by pointing out that President Eisenhow-
er in his farewell address warned that the power of
“the military-industrial complex” is now being felt
“in every city, every state house, every office of the
Federal Government.”

He cites the Army-Air Force battle for public con-
gressional approval of conflicting and overlapping mis-
sile programs, in which each of the branches bought
the “devotion of Madison Avenue’s best brains” to
propagandize the nation. Present lobbying and adver-
tising by the military to influence public opinion is
added.

The article explains the degree of dependence on
military spending of many major industries and of
large areas of this country, and the way in which these
interests continually fight for increased military effort.

Perhaps the most convincing argument is that
of Douglas MacArthur. “Our government has
kept us in a perpetual state of fear—kept us in a
continuous stampede of patriotic fervor—with the
cry of grave national emergency. Always there
has been some terrible evil at home or some
monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble
us up if we did not blindly rally behind it by
furnishing the exorbitant funds demanded. Yet,
in retrospect, these disasters seem never to have
happened, seem never to have been quite real.”

The “missile gap,” draft calls, and army strength in-
creases are given as examples of this type of pulling
the wool over the public’s eyes. This portion of the
article is almost enough to make the reader forget
certain other parts of it.

 

Age-Old Gripes: Police, Medical Office

 

By ROSEWELL PAGE

We hear that the university has
changed and even progressed a
little in the past forty years. The
admission standards have gone up.
The “quality” of the student is
alleged to have risen considerably.
The physical improvements are per-
haps more obvious.

Well there are some things that
haven’t changed and among them
are the things that students most
often gripe about. In reading a pub-
lication which appeared on our cam-
pus some four decades ago, I came
across the following two articles.
Perhaps they will sound familiar to
the editors and readers of today’s
R-tP.

Article 1—headline: New Police
Bells Prove Great Success

“The Lexington Police have es-
tablished a system of eight bells
running from East Dorm up Main
Street to notify them of danger or
distress so that they can report to
the desk seargent, take a good drink
to bolster up their natural courage,
and with all the reinforcements they
can muster, march to the scene of
the trouble. Arrived there, of course
after everything is over, they are to
scatter all students with great club

 

waving, lest any of them should
shoot a blank cartridge and scare
Miss Annie. This done, they are to
spit vehemently on the ground and
utter oaths worthy of an army of-
ficer against all criminals daring to
set foot in this Rockbridge Garden
of Eden.

“Of course, the office of the desk
sergeant moves from place to place.
In the daytime it is either in front
of the Rockbridge Bank or Irwin’s
inn and in the wee hours of the
night it is in the Greek restaurant
in the downtown section of the city.

“We note with great pleasure that
the police have so bettered condi-
tions in the Greek restaurant that
only plates and catsup bottles are
used as weapons in the fights there
now.

“We hope that the police depart-
ment will soon station a man in
each section of the dormitory to help
on the organization of crap and pok-
er games, to enforce the freshman
rules, and to bootleg for the Satur-
day night carousals....” and so the
article runs.

Men appeared on the same page.

ous maladies, one from acute appen-

“Thus said, thus done.

youth of the crippled ankle.

The complaints haven’t changed.
Perhaps the reasons for them haven’t

Dr. Smith
Discusses

U.S. Morals

By TRACY HARRINGTON

America—her morals and her so-
called leftist tendencies—are very
much under fire at the present
time.

For a number of years, various
groups have compared the United
States to Greece and Rome, declar-
ing that moral laxity in these em-
pires occured preceding their fall,
and moral laxity in this country now
indicates that we are going the way
of Greece and Rome.

W&L history professor Dr. C. O.
Smith, Jr., doesn’t agree.

Changing Values

“Certainly values have been
changing in this country, and what
the critics of change (conservatives)
are saying is that we will fall as
Rome did because we have some
of the moral characteristics.”

Dr. Smith, who said that to call
change in values “bad” is in it-
self a value judgment, said that
there are “many more differences
than similarities between us and
the ancient empires.

“Rome did not have the techno-
logical development or the impact of
modern science, or the industrial
revolution as a factor in its civili-
zation, as we do in ours.”

He added that “we cannot say
these changes mean degeneration.

“Even if moral degeneration were
a primary factor in the decline of
the Roman empire, there are too
many differences between our so-
ciety and that of the former to say
that what happens to them will
necessarily happen to us.”

He observed that what probably
changed Rome was “more economic
and political ills than moral ills.”
As examples, he cited the scarcity of
gold in Rome and the crushing of
the middle class by burdensome
taxation.

“Organic Theory”

One of the theories abandoned
by most historians, yet widely pre-
valent among many modern day
Americans, is what Dr. Smith called
“the organic theory.” This is the
belief that civilizations follow a
cycle—youth, middle age, old age
and death.

Dr. Smith said that the analogy
“is a poor one.”

He said that too many variables
were involved to compare a social
order to an organism. As an ex-
ception to the organic theory, he
mentioned the Chinese civilization,
which has continued for several
thousands years with periods of
weakness and subsequent reju-
venation, yet never “dying.”

About moral changes themselves,
Dr. Smith said they were bound
to come.

Values change under the influence
of technological and industrial in-
novations. Look at the effect of the
automobile on our values. Or, for
that matter, look how movies and
even urbanization have changed our
moral viewpoints.”

Liberal Tendencies

Dr. Smith commented on the
much-disputed question of exces-
sive liberal tendencies in the post-
depression United States.

“T wouldn’t like to do without the
liberal innovations in our govern-
ment,” he said.

“Can you imagine a society as
complex as our without income tax
or without social security?

“Ultra-conservatives want to go
back to some sort of blissful state
where the Puritan virtues of self-
reliance and rugged individualism
were widely practiced. (See editor-
ials—ed.) Everyone will agree that
these values were important in
shaping our American tradition; and
most will agree that these values
were ‘good.’

“But today many pressures in
our midst militate against these
values, pressures which cannot
readily be eliminated. How often
must the organization man pass the
buck? How often is he promoted
for heroic exhibition of individual-
ism?”

Dr. Smith said that the radical
conservatives seem to want to “op-
erate a country with 200 million
people, the large majority of whom
are urbanized, in the same manner
as a country with 20 million persons
primarily in frontier or agricultur-
al environments.

“It just cannot be done,” he said.

(In an interview article with Major
Roxbury last week, this reporter
states that the Major presented the
alternatives for America as as atomic
war or intermingling of democracy
and communism.

This was a misinterpretation on
the reporter’s part. Major Roxbury
believes, contrarily, that commun-
ism cannot and will not succeed, be-
cause it is not a practical system.

Undefeated Generals

Meet Centre Colonels

McLaughlin’s Charges
Shoot For Number Six

Washington and Lee’s undefeated Generals get a chance
to equal a school football record of long-standing when they
meet Centre College’s ‘Prayin’ Colonels” at Danville, Ky.,

Saturday.

If the Generals win, the contest will mark the 16th con-
secutive game without a loss, equaling a 16-game streak es-

 

tablished way back

The yesteryear record string in-
cluded the nine games of the all-
victorious 1914 season, and five wins,
a forfeit, and a tie in 1915.

The Generals’ current skein dates
from the final game of the 1959
season and includes a mid-season
tie last year.

Coach Lee McLaughlin’s deep
and experienced squad is now 5-0
for the current campaign. If—and
McLaughlin allows that it is a big
“if’—they manage to get by their
four remaining opponents, they
would still have to wait until the
first game of the 1962 season to
equal the school record of 14 con-
secutive wins without a loss or tie.

That venerable mark was recorded
through the 1912 and 1913 seasons,
which with the 1914-1915 campaigns,

' mark the golden years of W&L
q football.

Centre Films

To Be Shown

The Washington and Lee athletic
department will hold special show-
ing of action films taken during
this Saturday’s game against Centre
at 7:30 p.m. next Tuesday in duPont
Auditorium.

The entire student body is in-
vited.

Coach Lee McLaughlin will pro-
vide commentary on the action, as-
sisted by other members of the
coaching staff.

Current plans include the show-
ing of all away games for the rest
of the season.

The Generals have three more
games away from Lexington, includ-
ing contests with Centre, Sewanee,
and Washington University. Only
one more home game is on tap, a
November 18 meeting with Frederick
College.

has won only once in five outings
this year. The Colonels are young,
and they cannot match Washington
and Lee’s depth.

But, McLaughlin points out, they
are opportunists, converting six
Hanover fumbles into a 26-12 vic-
tory two weeks ago.

“They'll battle you all the way,
and a win over Washington and Lee
would make a good season for them,”
* McLaughlin says. “And they’re im-
proving with every game.

Last week, the Colonels fought
Sewanee savagely through the first
half, before wilting in the second

have been to Denison, 35-6; Mary-
ville, 34-0; and Southwestern, 21-0.

Centre’s 34-man squad includes
eight lettermen and 16 freshmen.
The Colonel’s chief offensive threats
from their straight-T are halfbacks
Bob Hourigan and Harley Veal. Veal
particularly impressed W&L scout
Buck Leslie.

Good Shape

The Generals are expected to be
in good condition for the Centre
game, despite the rugged physical
pounding they took in besting strong

in 1914-1915,*

day.

McLaughlin says the effort against

and one of the best his teams have

lege coach.

Frosh Fail

To Score
In Four Games

Washington and Lee’s freshman
football season is more than half
over and the Baby Generals have
yet to score a single point.

The closest the freshmen have
come to scoring was in their 12-0
loss to Woodberry Forest when they
drove to the four-yard line. Since
that defeat the Baby Generals have
lost to Ferrum Jr. College, 33-0;
Augusta Military Academy, 22-0;
and Chowan (N.C.) Jr. College, 50-0.

But freshman coach Dana Swan
thinks his crew will score Friday at
Fork Union when W&L meets the
Virginia Military League’s second
place team.

What’s wrong with the Baby Gen-
erals offense which compiled a minus
three yards total offense against
Chowan?

Swan can answer that
words: “Our line.”

The Baby Generals have a flock of
better-than-average backs headed
by Martinsville fullback Dan Man-
son and halfback Skip Chase from
Frankfort, Ky., and Bill David of
New York.

But up front it’s a different story.
What little talent the Baby Gener-
als possessed at the beginning of the
season has been either hurt or is
ineffective, three of their better line-
men were injured in the Chowan
game.

in two

“Our tackles did not give us any
protection against Chowan. They
didn’t stop a thing all day,” Swan
said. “But the tackles aren’t the
only linemen who need more work.”

champions played ZBT to a score-
less draw to clinch first place. The

Street needed a win to remain in
contention.

Also in League C, Lambda Chi
faced Pi Phi on October 31, and
completely overran them by the
score of 25-0. The victors scored all
of their points via the passing route.
Lambda Chi has won one contest,
while their opponents have yet to
score this season.

In a contest decided in the final
period, PiKA edged the players from
Phi Delt, 6-0, on the I-M field.
Nicky Smith scored the only points
of the game on a short run with
only minutes remaining. PiKA is the
only team in League A with an un-
blemished record.

On November 1, the Delts man-
aged to stop a last minute SPE at-
tack and preserve a 6-6 tie. The
Delts are now 2-0-1, while their
counterparts have tied one and lost
one. This afternoon the netmen
from the Beta house take on Phi
Kaps in the championship I-M ten-
nis match. In the annual double-
elimination tourney, both teams have
one setback, each from the other.

In their first meeting, Phi Kap
won easily by a score of 4-1. With
only one more defeat needed for
elimination, the Betas rallied to

 

Will Begin November 7

With the I-M football season almost over, the bowling and
wrestling programs will begin on Tuesday, November 7. The
bowling contests will be held at the Civic Bowling Alley, while
the wrestling matches will be in the gym.

In football the only league champion that has been decided

is Phi Kap in Division C. On Thursday, November 2, the

representatives from East Nelson} ong meeting.

Ron Hornburger topped Tom Ed-
wards, 6-3 6-2, to lead the men from
Red Square. Also winning in the
singles for the victors were Ray
Gordon and King Milling, while
John Roy and Tom Goodwin down-
ed their opponents, 6-4, 6-3, in the
doubles.

The lone winner for the Phi Kaps
was number three man Bud Holl-
man, who defeated Steve Parel, 6-2,
6-0.

In the championship golf match
of this year, the linksters from Phi
Delt downed the foursome from
SPE. Bob Carlson and Allen North-
cutt both shot forties for the vic-
tors, while teammates Dave Carroll
and Ken Lane also played well.

The top teams in intramural swim-
ming were Phi Psi with 100 points,
SAE with 87, Sigma Chi with 82,
Delt with 78, and KA with 68.

The 28 lively, pastel-colored paint-

Conservatives
Slate Articles
In N ewspapers

A series of articles written by
members of the W&L Conservative
Society’s publicity committee is
scheduled for publication in the
Ring-tum Phi, sometime in the im-
mediate future. The articles will not
deal with the goals of the W&L
society, but will focus attention on
issues of national importance.

The first story of the series will
be in defense of the House Un-
American Activities Committee and
the film “Operation Abolition” which
was recently shown on the W&L
campus by the conservatives. The
article will not seek to defend the
local showing of the film, but will
answer some criticisms of the film
and of HUAC made on the national
level.

The articles to follow will deal
with admission of Red China to the
United Nations and the present
U.S. position in the UN, the relation-
ship of NATO and the neutral pow-
ers to Russian nuclear testing, the
Western position in Berlin and the
U.N.’s responsibility to the Congo.

Eight seniors turned in applica-
tions for Fulbright scholarships in
time to meet the November 1 dead-
line. Of these, four were for work
in England, two for Spain, and two
for Germany.

The Fulbright program was ini-

More than one thousand scholar-
ships are awarded yearly, sending
students to twenty-six countries. The
principal countries are Germany,
France, and England. Washington

and Lee has been fortunate in re-
ceiving at least one award every
year since the program was initiated.
The total number of awards re-
ceived by W&L men is approxi-

In determining the winners, the
following factors are considered: (1)
a definite statement of purpose, (2)
extra-curricular activities, and (3)
academic work. The winners of the
awards will be announced early next
year.

Undefeated Generals

(Continued from page 1)

no more fruitful than those spent
by Chipley, but in 1958, a class en-
tered the University that had the
kind of boy W&L wanted. It includ-
ed the boys who make up the nu-
cleus of this year’s undefeated
team—Suttle, Fohs, and Russ, for
example.

From then on, the Generals’ tide
of fortune went on the upswing, in-
stead of being buried somewhere
between the pitiable and the pathet-
ic as during the immediate post-
subsidization years.

Today, writes Bingham, McLaugh-
lin can field a competent team—a
team that doesn’t depend on the
special talents of a few super-stars.

“McLaughlin generally uses most
of his 50-odd players, not because
he is a kind man, but because the
talent is evenly distributed.”

“This year’s General squad,” says
Bingham,” is complete proof that
winning football on an unsubsidized
basis can be as much fun to play
and as exciting to watch as football
anywhere.”

Economics and Religion Departments Sponsor Seminar

 

Boulding To Lead Seminar

Kenneth E. Boulding, Pro-
fessor of Economics at the
University of Michigan will
lead a series of seminars and
lectures under the joint spon-
sorship of the Departments of
Economics and Religion, Nov.

14-15.

Professor Boulding will give
public lectures in Lee Chapel
at 7:30 each evening, it was
announced today.

The topics selected for the lectures
are “Ethical Problems of Capitalist
Development” on Tuesday and
“Ethical Problems in Socialist De-
velopment” on Wednesday.

Professor Boulding brings an un-
common background and unusual
breadth to the Washington and Lee
campus. Author among other things
of a book of poetry, There is a
Spirit, and a book of philosophy,

 

The Image, he is primarily an econ-
omist, but consistent with the con-
ception of the “whole man,” cited
above, Boulding is an active member
of the Religious Society of Friends,
recognized in theological circles as
well as in scientific company.

Kenneth Boulding was born and
educated in England, taking his B.A.
degree and first class honors at Ox-
ford University. He came to the
United States as a Commonwealth
Fellow in the University of Chicago
in 1932. He began his teaching ca-
reer at the University of Edinburgh
two years later but returned to the
United States in 1937. He has re-
sided in America since that time and
he became a United States citizen in
1948. He taught at Colgate, Fisk, lowa
State, and McGill Universities prior
to going to Michigan in 1949, and
he served for a year in the League
of Nations Secretariat.

Boulding is an economist of the
very first rank. In 1949 he received
the John Bates Clark medal of the

 

American Economic Association,an

award made biennially to an econ-
omist under forty years of age who
has done outstanding work. His
Economic Analysis, now in_ its
third edition, is one of the stand-
ard texts in the “intermediate
theory” course in economics. Other
books he has written in economics
include A Reconstruction of Eco-
nomics (1950), The Organizational
Revolution (a book in which ethical
questions are stressed, 1953), and
The Skills of the Economist (1958),
Principles of Economic Policy (1958),
and The Economics of Peace (1945).

In the field of religion he con-| :

tributed the chapter on economics
to the eclectic Religious Perspectives
in College Teaching, and his William

Penn lecture of 1942 was published | _
under the title The Practice of the

Love of God.

In addition to the public lectures,
Boulding will speak in several class-
es in religion and economics and he
will meet with some students and
faculty members in less formal cir-
cumstances.

 

Dance Board Creates Advisory Group
Ww w

Ww

COUNCIL TO PROVIDE LINK BETWEEN STUDENTS AND BOARD

The Dance Board announc-
ed this morning that it plans
to form a committee to be
known as the Dance Board
Advisory Council.

The primary function of
this committee, Dance Board
Vice President Frank Young
said, will be to serve as a link
between the Board and the
Student Body.

Membership on the Advisory
Council, he said, will be open to
all W&L students.

Twenty to twenty-five members
will be selected, Young said.

Rely On Recommendations

The Dance Board will rely heavily
on the recommendations of this
group in formulating plans about
what bands to contact, Young ad-
ded.

 

Any student interested in serving
on this new committee should ap-
ply in writing to Frank Young at
the Phi Delta Theta House before
Wednesday, November 15. Applica-
tions should state the student’s qual-
ifications and reasons for wishing
to become a member of the commit-
tee.

Committee to Serve

The new committee will also serve
as a means of relating the actions of
the Dance Board to the students.
Members of the Council will be ac-
quainted with the activities of the
Board, Young said, thereby provid-
ing experienced members for future
years.

Meet Regularly

The committee will meet regularly
and will attempt to anticipate the
type of entertainment the Student
Body desires, he said.

In other areas, members of the
Council will assist the Dance Board
in the sale of Dance Plans and

We Apologize
In last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi
the name of Edward Paddock
Hobbs was omitted from the list
of students selected for Who's

Who in American Colleges and
Universities.

Hobbs justly deserves to be in
Who’s Who for he is tri-captain
of the football team, chairman of
the Cold Check Committee, the
ROTC battle group commander,
and is president of Scabbard and
Blade. He has also served on the
Assimilation Committee, has play-
ed baseball for four years, and is
on the Dean’s List.

The Tuesday Edition apologizes
for this error.

Resolution On Dr. King To Go To Trustees

By STEVE GUILD
Executive News Editor

In a two and one-half hour meeting yesterday afternoon the faculty approved the pro-
posed student disciplinary committee of the Executive Committee of the Student Body; ap-
proved a faculty resolution concerning Dr. Martin Luther King; and agreed to the supression

of the Mongolian Minks.

The faculty action on Martin Luther King was their first to be taken since the proposal
to invite King to the campus for a Seminar in Religion was rejected by the Board of Trustees.
The resolution, according to Frank Parsons, director of
Information Services, will be sent to each of the Trustees. At
a later date the contents of the resolution will be made public

Notice

The Constitutional Reform Com-
mittee of the Executive Committee
is making a careful study of the
Student Body Constitution. In addi-
tion it is calling for proposals for
changes in the Constitution from the
Student Body at large.

*

 

 

These proposals should be sub-
mitted in writing, accompanied by
a reason for them, to Steve Suttle)
or sent to the Executive Committee
by November 22, 1961.

It is the plan of the Reform Com- |
mittee to study these proposals and |
submit them to the Executive Com- |
mittee for voting. |

The voting will be carried out in
accordance with the present con-|
stitution.

by President Cole.

The Student Control Committee, which was approved by
the faculty, was proposed by several students during the cam-
pus elections last spring. Since the beginning of school a special
committee of the Executive Committee has been working with
the Administrative Committee of the faculty to make the stu-

dent committee effective.

The duty of the Student Council*

Committee will be to investigate
and take appropriate action on con-
duct offences reported to it by the
University Proctor, the administra-
tion of the neighboring institutions,
or the Executive Committee of the
Student Body.

The committee will (1) review all
cases of disciplinary action now
handled by the Administrative Com-
mittee, except those involving po-
lice court convictions (2) have juris-
diction in all cases concerning mis-
conduct at other schools, if the
school itself wishes to let the com-
mittee handle the matter (3) submit
all actions taken in a report to the
Dean of Students that will be
studied by the Administrative Com-
mittee, which reserves the right to
take further action on the case if
needed (4) not hold the power to
dismiss from school for disciplinary
reasons.

The Student Control Committee
itself is on a trial basis and is sub-
ject to review at any time by the
Administrative Committee and the
faculty.

Uncas McThenia, president of
the Student Body, stressed the
responsibility of the students in
a statement made late this morn-
morning. “We of the Executive
Committee very much appreciate
the trust and good faith that the
faculty has placed in the Student
Body of Washington and Lee. We
realize that we now have a great
obligation to make this proposal
work,

“A great deal of time and effort
on the part of both the Adminis-
trative Committee and the Execu-

heiieion Establishing § uP Control Committee

It is recommended that there be
appointed a Student Control Com-
mittee by the Executive Commit-
tee of the Student Body. This
committee will be composed of
two seniors, one junior, one soph-
omore, and one law student. The
chairman of the committee will be
named by the Executive Commit-
tee of the Student Body. This
committee will operate in the two
areas set forth below.

I. Inter-Institutional Relations.
If a report is received from another
institution of undesirable conduct
on the part of a Washington and
Lee student or students on that
campus, the report will be refer-
red to the Student Control Com-
ittee for investigation and appro-
priate action including disciplinary
penalties and report to the other
institution. If the Administrative
authorities of the other institution
feel that the offense is of such ser-
iousness that it prefers to have it
handled by the Administrative
authorities of Washington and Lee,
it may so request. It is understood
that the authorities of the neigh-
boring colleges will be informed
fully of any policy change that is
instituted through the action now
being proposed.

 

 

Il. Campus Conduct. The Stu- |

dent Control Committee will be
charged with responsibility for
investigating conduct offenses by

 

tive Committee has gone into the
proposal. This was done partly
because it was believed that the
students are able to assume the
authority required in this area.
The burden is now on the student
body to show that it is deserving
of this delegation of responsibili-
ty.”

Dean Frank Gilliam, Dean of
Students, had this to say of the
faculty decision:

“I think the Faculty was glad to
pass the action in its desire to
see the student authority operate
as effectively as possible in the
realm of student life and conduct;
and in the hope that the result
will be highly creditable to the
students as individuals and to
Washington and Lee as an insti-
tution.”

The third action of the faculty
in its meeting was the suppression
of the Mongolian Minks.

The Minks, a student social so-
ciety, through the action of the Ad-
ministrative Committee, will not be
permitted to appear in public or
make any public demonstration of
any kind. This action on the part of
the faculty was apparently the re-
sult of the half-time antics which
the Mongolian Minks participated in
during this year’s Homecomings
football game.

Thorns Craven, president of the
society, stated in an interview late
last night that “the action of the
faculty on the Minks comes as a
great shock to me, and I feel that
they have spelled the death of one
of the traditions of Washington and
Lee.”

 
   

SPREE

individuals reported to it by the
University Proctor or by the mem-
bers of the Executive Committee
of the Student Body. The Execu-
tive Committee of the Student
Body agrees to accept such re-
sponsibility. The Student Control
Committee will have the authority
to enforce such displinary penal-
ties (except dismissal) as it thinks
advisable. It is understood that
the Proctor will exercise his judg-
ment as to whether the offense is
of such seriousness that it should
be reported directly to the Dean
of Students for action through the
Administrative Committee rather
than to the Student Control Com-
mittee. The Student Control Com-
mittee may likewise judge a case
to be of such seriousness that it
wishes to ask that the Administ-
trative Committee take direct con-
trol. Any offense reported as a
result of police court convictions in
connection with misconduct will
automatically be referred to the
Administrative Committee
through the Dean of Students,
rather than to the Student Control
Committee.

A full report in writing of all
actions taken by the Student Con-
trol Committee will be submitted
immediately to the Dean of Stu-
dents. These reports will be sub-
mitted periodically to the Admin-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Answer:

The Tuesday Edition is not the least interested
in taking sides with the liberal versus conservative
issue, either nationally or locally. Our aim is to simp-
ly report objectively student attitudes and opinions
as reflected by the writings of campus leaders.

In none of our articles published on the King
matter has there been any concern for the political
implications involved. We are solely interested in
the fact that we have been denied the right of free
inquiry and would take the same stand whether
the personality involved was Adolph Eichman or
the Imperial Wizard of the Klu Klux Klan.

The proposal to invite King to speak here was
the decision of one group—The University Christian

Tuesday’s Stand
Not Political

Association. The proposal was then submitted by
the Faculty Committee on Christian Work to the
Board of Trustees. We mention this in answer to
the accusation that the proposal to invite Dr. King #® :
“showed a definite lack of intelligence and ability to # Dear Mr. Goodwin:

exercise mature judgment.”

In reference to the statement “your efforts to base
refusal of his invitation upon academic freedom is &
foolish and ridiculous and without the slightest
merit,” we would like to point out that this was one
of the opinions that Clarence Darrow was fighting in
1925 in the Scopes Monkey Trial.

New Committee Needs Support

The announcement today that the Washington and Lee
Faculty passed the proposal presented by the Executive Com-
mittee to form a Student Control Committee is indeed a giant
step in the area of giving the student body more control over
its own members.

 

We hail the faculty for this action, and we sincerely hope
that this committee will prove to be one of the most influential
committees on this campus.

It is necessary that each and every member of the Student
Body give his most sincere support to this committee. The
faculty has expressed a faith in the students by passing this
proposal. The Student Body should not destroy this faith by

giving only lip service to this all-important committee.

To Coach Mac And His Boys

Our gentlemen who play football won another game Sat-
urday. The Five-Star Generals massacred Centre College,
53-0, in their most lopsided win since 1951 when a subsidized
eleven trampled Virginia Tech, 60-0. The victory was the
Generals 10th in a row and marked their 16th straight game
without a loss.

But winning a game isn’t the most important thing. It’s
how you play the game that counts most in the end. Saturday
our gentlemen played their usual brand of football—‘‘Win
if you can, but first, be a gentleman.”

Applying this principle, the Generals rolled up a 37-0
halftime lead much to the embarrassment of coach Lee
McLaughlin. Coach Mac, who well remembers the long
afternoon he sat through while other teams dashed our
goal line at will in his first years at W&L, knows how the
losing coach feels. Consequently, he usually plans to hold
down the score after the Generals are comfortably ahead.

Saturday every trick he tried in an effort to stop the Gen-
erals’ steaming offensive machine backfired in his favor.

For example, on the second half kickoff he put eight mem-
bers of the White Team plus Steve Suttle, Dan Blain, and
Doug Martin on the field. Suttle, Blain, and Martin had orders
to receive the kickoff and immediately kick the ball back to
Centre. Suttle grabbed the kickoff and sent the ball soaring
over the heads of the bewildered Centre players. Centre was
so bewildered, in fact, that it fumbled Suttle’s kick and W&L
recovered. Horrors, thought McLaughlin. The troubled
coach then instructed kicking specialist Jim Russ to try a field
goal on first down. Russ’ attempt was wide. Now, thank good-
ness, Centre got the ball.

Centre, however, just did not want to co-operate with Mc-
Laughlin’s sympathetic intentions. The Colonels gave the ball
right back to the Generals and Coach Mac again ordered Russ
to exercise his toe on first down. Result, a 25-yard field goal,
Russ’ first of the season.

A short time later W&L intercepted a Centre pass
and raced deep in Colonel territory. Coach Mac again
summoned Russ, but before he could put Russ into the
game sophomore quarterback A. J. Barranco scooted six
yards for a touchdown.

Final result, a lopsided win and a bewildered coach who
wonders if it’s at all possible to keep his team from running up
astronomical scores.

Coach Mac and his boys are establishing a football tradi-
tion at Washington and Lee. A tradition of which every stu-
dent, faculty member, and alumnus should be proud. Our
gentlemen are proving to the entire country that it isn’t neces-
sary to have 30 scholarships and a ‘‘goon”’ squad to win football
games, just desire and determination.

There is one part of Coach McLaughlin’s football
philosophy that deserves special praise. Coach Mac always
tells his boys, “If you are on my team, you'll get to play,”
and he strictly adheres to this policy.

The Centre game was a fine example of just how those last
20 players of a 50 man squad, who would ride the bench on
any other team, can repay a coach for giving them an oppor-
tunity to play. W&L rolled up 323 total yards and more than
half of that total—188 yards—was gained by the third and
fourth teams. What better form of praise could be paid to a
football coach and his system than the performance of the
third and fourth teams Saturday.

Students’ Lives Hard
At W&L Century Ago

By KEN LANE
Associate Editor

The gradual decay of W&L’s traditions is a much discussed
topic among modern-day critics. We hear repeatedly how the
incoming freshmen are blatantly neglecting to maintain the

sacred customs so much a part of the University.
*

Our speaking tradition, observe
the critics, has practically disap-
peared, evidenced only by dim
echoes here and there from a few
die-hards. Conventional dress,
though it seems to exist still, has
likewise lost the backing of popu-
lar consent and sympathies are
turning against it. So, the school’s
moralists point out, from the few
remaining regulations of student
life we are able to detect signs of
indifference and decay.

For the benefit of those recalci-
trants who consider the yoke of tra-
dition too hard to bear, in order to
make them writhe in their complac-
ency, this edition of the Ring-tum
Phi looks to the past. Back to the
past. Back to the “good old days”
when going to college meant healthy,
rigorous discipline. Back to the days
when VMI was a nursery school
compared to the grind of W&L.

The year is 1830, a slight jump
backwards over the span of time,
we notice, for it is at night that we
make our descent upon the campus,
that the glow of candlelight scintil~
lates from each window of the stu-
dent dormitory. We can distinguish
the shadows of students in diligent
concentration over their books. Such
a sight is not to be marvelled at, for
these students are working mainly
because they have to. To encourage
them in their labor, a periodic check
is made in the dorms by a member
of the faculty.

These students had a number of
other restrictions: They had to rise
at 5 o’clock every morning and im-
mediately assemble for prayers, af-
ter which the day’s activities would
begin. In addition to the daily early
morning services, church attendance
on Sundays was compulsory.

Furthermore, no one could visit
the library without special per-
mission. (This rule was necessary
because parties of students used to
lock themselves in and organize
card games.) There were no form-
al Saturday morning classes, but
students were compelled to work
on their studies instead. The fac-
ulty had the power to dismiss any-
one who showed an attitude of in-
subordination or negligence.

Seven years later, the first conven-
tional dress was instituted. Accord-
ing to the HISTORICAL PAPERS of
W&L, the attire was made us as
follows: “A coat made of deep blue
cloth, the price of which shall not
exceed seven dollars per yard, and
that the coat be cut with a straight
collar, to be fastened before with
hooks and eyes, and be trimmed
with black braid and buttons, with
a black silk star worked on each

was for the better. However, there
have been changes made at the Uni-
versity which are not apparent to
the eye of the casual or untrained
observer.

These changes became apparent
from a reading of the views expres-
sed in your October 24th edition of
the Ring-tum Phi; particularly those
of Robert C. Ketcham, Thorns Cra-
ven and your editorial writer G.A.N.
(I presume Andy Nea) concerning
the action of the Board of Trustees
in refusing to allow Martin Luther
King to speak at the University.
Not being familiar with those who
originally extended the invitation to
King I can only surmise as to the
reasons for the invitation, mainly:
(1) Christian enlightenment, (2) na-
tional attention or notoriety for the
University, or (3) misguided liberal-
ism.

I would like to believe that the
first reason was the basis for the in-
vitation but based upon the com-
ments of your three writers men-
tioned above I cannot accept this as
the true reason. While King is no
doubt a minister of some religious
faith I feel his main claim to fame
rests upon his ability at fomenting
racial discord and unrest, which,
while it may have been intended as
non-violent, has certenly led to vio-
lence which violence was the proxi-
mate result of his urging. If Chris-
tian enlightment be the reason, cer-
tainly an outstanding minister of the

There’s Dark, Evil Force
At Work On Virginia Campus

material for this column Saturday

night, we chanced upon a recent copy of The Cavalier Daily. After a
thorough perusal of this all-encompassing publication, we have come to
the conclusion that there is rampant discontent on the campus to the North.

 

=x
~

It appears that the University’s
calendar called for only a one-day
Thanksgiving holiday while the stu-
dent body had in mind a four-day
vacation. A student Council letter to
President Shannon changed nothing,
and this group announced that it
would take no further action on the
matter.

Here we quote: “Galen Danis,
the leader of the first-year group
which led the campaign for the
long holiday, had disbanded his
group.

Danis told a Cavalier Daily re-
porter, ‘We tried hard to do what we
thought was right and we tried to
do it by going through the proper
channels in a gentleman-like fash-
ion. But it seems that the student
body just didn’t care enough.
(Apathy) My group and I have
nothing to do with the rumored rally
Thursday night in Mad Bowl.’”

One column away from this ar-
ticle was the headline “Bugle, Dix-
ie Yells Occur in Riot at Dormitori-
es.” This, however, was not the riot
to which Mr. Danis was referring.
Rather this was the first in a series
of three. Mr. Danis’ Thursday night
shindig—our information is rather
scanty on this one—was the second.

 

The grand climax came last Sat-

urday night, the Saturday night of
Virginia’s Openings. As these very
reporters wearily searched the wet
streets of Charlottesville for a
story, the third riot blossomed be-
fore our eyes. There on Rugby

christian faith such as Norman Vin-
cent Peale or Cardinal Spellman
could be prevailed upon to make an
appearance during religious empha-
sis week.

As for supposed reason No. (2)—
Notoriety or national attention for
the University—Heaven forbid a
speaker of this type for this purpose.
Would you seek the attention and
notoriety visited upon Jackson,
Mississippi, Leavittown, Pennsylvan-
ia, and Little Rock, Arkansas? I be-
lieve that had this invitation been
extended, Washington and Lee Uni-
versity would have received equal
notoriety with these communities
but without the customary violence.

As for supposed reason No. (3)—
Misguided liberalism on the part of
those who would extend the invita-
tion—I can only conclude that this
is a part of the reason or answer, the
other being contained in reason No.
(2) above.

To me there is no doubt that the
motivating purpose of those who
proposed the invitation was not
Christian enlightenment, betterment
of the University or improvement
of the minds of those who would
hear the remarks King might have
made.

Mr. Craven said in his article the
decision “was for me a personal in-
sult to my intelligence and the abil-
ity of the student body to exercise
mature judgment when faced with
a current problem.” It is apparent
the proposal to extend the invitation
showed a definite lack of intelligence
and ability to exercise mature judg-
ment.

If you desire to take up the cud-
gels for the Negro, go to it, but I de-
ney your right to use the school pap-
er or the University itself to try to
ram your ideas down the throats of
impressionable young men. Your ef-
forts to base refusal of his invita-
tion upon academic freedom is fool-
ish and ridiculous and without the
slightest merit.

The Board of Trustees was entire-
ly right in its conclusion and should
be commended for not bowing to
a group which apparently thinks
more of Martin Luther King than
the University.

Editor-in-Chief

There is no such thing as justice—in or out of court.
Clarence Darrow, 1936.

After reading the column by Rosewell Page—Age-
Old Gripes: Police, Medical Office—that appeared in
last Friday’s paper, a series of events that took place
in Lexington Saturday night are of particular signif-
icance.

Years ago, as Mr. Page shows, students were
plagued by the Lexington Police, and from observing
this crew of men in uniform in action this past Sat-
urday night, I can assure you that this problem is still
very much with us.

After searching for a spot that I could use as a
good observing point, I finally found the ideal loca-
tion. It was located above one of the local pubs on
Main Street, and this observatory happened to be
the front porch of one of my associates’ apartment.

* * *

Item one: Two “townies” emerge from pub. Argu-
ment takes place, violent language, cursing and fist
fight errupts. Fight and commotion easily classified
as a “public disturbance.” Fight lasts about five to 10
minutes, no local lawman in sight.

Item two: A few minutes later, another fight breaks
out—this time on the other side of the street. Again
what I would term a “public disturbance.” Partici-
pants sight squad car approaching, break up fight, be-
gin to move down the street as if nothing had taken
place. Squad car stops, two policemen emerge. Police
talk to a few of the participants involved, tell local
hotrodders to move on. No arrest made.

dents seen walking down same street near local hang-
out. Unfortunately, one of the students has a cup in
his hand. Two VMI cadets appear. Verbal argument
takes place over who should have won Saturday’s
game between VMI and The Citadel. Loud talking,
no violence involved.

Local citizen appears, attempts to get participants
to move on. Local citizen disappears. Cadets walk
back toward VMI, students turn and begin to walk
back uptown. Student carrying cup in hand sighted
by officers in approaching squad car. Squad car stops,
police get out, take student holding cup into custody.
Police haul student off to jail.

* * *

This series of incidents, however slight it may seem,
brings a question to my mind. Is it a worse crime in
Lexington to become involved in fist fights, while
yelling and screaming gross and uncouth language, or
is it more of a crime to walk along the street with a
cup in one’s hand? The latter would appear to be the
worse offense, if what I saw happen Saturday night is
any prerequisite to forming an opinion.

It appears to me that the crux of this small incident
is basically this: If the Lexington Police worried half
as much about their local “citizens” as they did about
the conduct of the Washington and Lee students,
then Lexington might, and I say “might,” be a decent
place in which to live. Sometimes I have my doubts,

however.
* + *

The next step? Simply this. As for me, I’d better
steer clear of the Police. They’ll be after me, but I'll
be looking for them.

 
THE RING-TUM PHI

Generals Blank Centre, 53-0;
Capture Tenth Straight Victory

By DON WALLIS
Assistant Sports Editor

Centre College football teams have carried an unusual
nickname for many years, ever since one of them played an
unbeaten, top-ranked Army eleven to a scoreless tie in one
of the greatest upsets in football history. Sportswriters, figur-
ing the obscure little Kentucky college just couldn’t have ac-
complished this feat on its gridiron ability alone, concluded
the Colonels must have had divine inspiration and dubbed

them the “‘Prayin’ Colonels.”

The name has stayed with Centre teams, even though they
have long since stopped playing Army. In fact, considering
their performance against W&L Saturday, the Colonels must
have long since stopped praying, too.

 

At any rate, Centre didn’t have*

even a prayer of stopping the un-
defeated General steamroller as it
smashed its way to victory number
six of the season, an effortless 53-0
rout of a hapless, helpless group of
inexperienced Prayin’ Colonels.

The game was over in three
minutes, and everyone, including
Centre, knew it. At this point,
Coach Lee MacLaughlin felt con-
fident enough to yank his first

string players and rest them the
remainder of the afternoon. Four
minutes later the score was 22-0
and after that it was just a matter
of how many points the Generals
wanted to pile up.

They decided to complete the job
in gentlemanly fashion, as if in def-
erence to Sports Illustrated maga-

 

zine. After taking the count to 37-0

at the half, the Generals spent the
rest of the game running experimen-
tal patterns, crossing the goal line
only when necessary. They did,
however, remain all business on de-
fense—Centre ended 60 minutes of
football with a net rushing yardage
of one.

On offense, though, the Big Blue
took advantage of the lopsided score
to try a few unorthodox maneuvers.
At the start of the second half, for
example, Steve Suttle caught the
Centre kickoff and promptly kicked
it right back to the Colonels. Coach
Mac had called the play perfectly
legal, but seldom done during the
halftime intermission, and it worked
perfectly—the Centre players, com-
pletely surprised, failed to block at
all and the Colonel who picked the
ball up was quickly swarmed upon
by a host of W&L tacklers. He fum-
bled, the Generals recovered, and
moments later Jim Russ _ booted
Washington and Lee’s first field goai
uf the year.

John Norman ran for a touch-
down moments later. He was the
second Louisville, Ky., native to

 

IN LOSING CAUSE—Freshman Steve Hibbard, General right wing, fights Roanoke College goalie for ball in

Green Tough

Like the catcher in baseball and
the middle lineman in football, the
soccer goalie is the workhorse of the
team who seldom receives the praise
he deserves.

Soccer coach Joe Lyles, however,
has singled out Tom Green, a
Sigma Nu sophomore from St.
Louis as worthy of being Sports
Star of the Week.

“Green,” pointed out Lyles,
“played his best game of the sea-
son Friday in our 2-1 loss to Roa-
noke. Some of the saves he made
were unbelievable, and were it not
for his tremendous play in the goal

been greater than one point.”

Lean Year
“As far as the whole season is
concerned,” said Lyles, “it is just

going to be one of those lean years.
We had flunkouts and injuries which
have hurt us in key positions. Also

the margin of defeat would have, it takes the freshmen a while to

learn the ropes.”

Meet Virginia
The booters’ next game will be
away against UVa. and Lyles terms
it “a real tough game with perhaps
the best team in the state.”

score for the Generals, much to
the delight of the many W&L
alumni from Louisville who drove
to Danville for the game. The oth-
er was halfback Stu Yoffe, like
Norman a sophomore, who sprint-
ed 45 yards with an intercepted
pass in the first period and went
two yards for a conversion in the
second. Yoffe, in fact, was the
leader of the offensive attack Sat-
urday, along with fullback Doug
Martin (another Kentuckian),

Martin scored twice on runs of
eight and 24 yards. Jim Russ ac-
counted for five points on two con-
versions and his 25-yard field goal.
fommy Keessee smashed 35 yaras
for a touchdown, Robin Wood
sneaked one yard for a 6-pointer and
A. J. Barranco scored on a six-yard
carry late in the game. Charlie
Gummey ran for the conversion on
the first two touchdowns.

Sewanee Next

The easy win set the stage for
next week’s all-important game at
Sewanee, a place General teams
have found quite unfriendly in the
past. Washington and Lee will be
seeking its seventh straight win of
the year, and will also be attempting
to break the W&L record unbeaten
string of 16 games, a mark which
they tied Saturday.

Although Coach MacLaughlin
rested his charges considerably
during the afternoon, two players,
Phil McCaleb and Lanny Butler,
suffered injuries which are be-
lieved to be only minor. Both are
expected to be ready for Satur-
day’s battle at Sewanee.

IGENERAL COMMENT]

By HARRY MEEM
Staff Reporter

" A recent edition of the R-t P devoted about three inches of comment
to the S and U grades given the Freshmen this year, and the fact that
almost 100 fewer “U’s” were given out this time.

The total reads 219 this year. Thirty-eight of them were given
to the 57 freshman athletes on the football, soccer, and cross-coun-
try teams.

Maybe it’s a bit premature of us to start crying “wolf,” but this seems
to be as good a time as any to start worrying about losing those athletes
who come to W&L.

Ask Joe Lyles how much this year’s soccer team could have used
Breck Alexander, who didn’t make it past the first semester last
year. Or talk to Bob McHenry, who could certainly use John Mc-
Dowell’s 6’ 6” on this year’s basketball team, which averages 6’ 2”.

So what’s to be done? One solution might be to have the Varsity Club
tutor those athletes in the freshman class who are having trouble with
their grades.

Some of the members of the Club don’t think much of this idea. They
say they have labs, and have to practice, and still must keep their grades
up. Or, they say, it should be the job of each fraternity to make its pledges
work on their studies. Another member says it’s not so much a question
of improving the freshman’s ability to hit the books as it is to get him to
use the ability he obviously had to have to be admitted here in the first
place.

Let’s assume for a moment that this last premise is correct, and
that the freshman athletes must be made to study. How can you show
them where they can fine the time? Is this the Varsity Club’s Job?

A quick glance at the membership list of the Club shows seven men on
the Dean’s List. Two of these are busy with football in the fall and other
sports during the spring seasons. How do they do it? Where do they find
the time?

Offhand, we can think of two athletes we know who have won
their letters and have also been recommended by the University as
candidates for Rhodes Scholarships. This recommendation, needless
to say, takes pretty good grades. How do they get them?

Maybe the Varsity Club could arrange to get some of its scholastically
exemplary members together with those freshmen who are having troubles
finding time to study, practice, and do other things. Tutoring the freshmen
might best be left to the houses. But it seems to us that only an athlete can
tell another athlete where he finds the time to practice and study too. In
this respect, the Varsity Club could perform a valuable service not only
for the University’s teams, but for the freshman athletes.

Evil At Work On UVa. Campus

(Continued from page 2)
Road history was being written.

Amid automobile burning and bot-
tle throwing, the students of Vir-
ginia expressed their displeasure in
a gentleman-like fashion.

We were fortunate indeed in be-
ing struck by nothing heavier than
a wadded copy of The Cavalier
Daily. This proved to be a double
blessing, for, without this missile
which we promptly salvaged, we
would have had no explanation for
the evening’s activities.

It is our opinion that Mr. Danis’
group never actually disbanded, that
it instead went underground to
work in deepest secrecy, only com-
ing out occasionally to stir up feeling
amongst an already aroused popu-
lace. Our warning to the Adminis-
tration at Virginia: There is a dark
and evil force at work on your
campus. Squelch it.

IT’S VARSITY SCHOLARS VS. POMONA

 

Student Views
On Committee

Are Skeptical

An inquiry into student
body opinion this week reveal-
ed that many students do not
know what the newly-created
Student Disciplinary Commit-
tee is and that most of them

do not know much about it.

When questioned, most students
registered shock for a moment; about
25 per cent had never heard of the
committee. Many others did not un-
derstand how the committee will
work or what it will do.

Although the majority of opinion
backed the idea of the committee,
some spoke against it. “It’s just
another committee; they have so
many committees around here now
you can’t think straight. I don’t see
what it can accomplish.”

Jay Clark saw a need for the
committee brought out by the re-
cent riots at UVa. “I think it will
serve well in a liaison capacity
between the student body and the
EC. It will handle cases which I
think should not be under the
jurisdiction of the EC or the
Administration,” he said.

Phil Sharp expressed hope for the
committee but opined that they had
a big job. “I believe that the IFC,
given the chance to handle Rush and
Hell Week, hasn’t done that very
well; and unless the Student Disci-
plinary Committee can proceed along
better lines than this student com-
mittee, I don’t think it will accom-
plish anything. The committee must
start off and keep a good strong
policy.”

“This is Washington and Lee stu-
dents’ chance to prove their matur-
ity, and I'll bet you they ball it up,”
commented Jack Andrews.

Jack Vardaman stated “I’m very
much in favor of students being able
to regulate student behavior. I be-
lieve this will be a satisfactory ex-
periment.”

“[’'m quite happy that the faculty
has displayed this confidence in
the student body, and hope that
the students can fulfill it. The stu-
dent body can make this commit-
tee work. All we need to do is get
a good committee,” said Dick Mc-
Enally.

Most students seem to be in fav-
or of the new committee but few

Dr. Taylor Cole, professor of po-
litical science from Duke Universi-
ty, last night told a Lee Chapel
audience that the constitution of
Nigeria, the fifteenth African state
to attain its independence, could well
set the precedent for future leader-
ship in Africa. The highly agrarian
state, though still plagued by lep-
rosy and sleeping sickness, is one of
the most modern of the newly arisen
nations and has greatly increased its
exports in its year of independence.

Most of the young leaders, many
between the ages of 35 and 45, either
attended schools in the U.S. or Bri-
tain, or were trained by Christian
missionaries. Seemingly the West
would have a big jump on Commun-
ism, but in 1959 when Dr. and Mrs.
Cole attended a series of debates in
Nigeria, “Is Benevolent Dictatorship
more applicable to Nigeria than
Parliamentry Democracy?”, the re-
sults were unfavorable to capital-
ism. In the debates, the dictatorships
of Russia and Red China were com-
pared and_ surprisingly enough,
China was unanimously preferred
because she has moved rapidly and
effectively to achieve her ends, with
no regard to the means of attain-
ment, and she is not white.

One of the major international
trade union confederations, known
to be Communistic, is now firmly
established in all regions of Nigeria

gun construction on their embassy
in Lagos. The U.S. government has
not given any sizeable amount of
aid to Nigeria but the Ford Founda-
tion and various other private agen-
cies have given much.

Dr. Cole remarked that the one-
party domination in each of the
three major regions apparently
would hamper the growth of federal-
ism. But, he said, many of the tribal
chiefs who were once afraid to look
to the center for guidance have
shown a trend towards increasing
unity.

The minorities in Nigeria, such as
the Christians in the Moslem North,
feel discriminated against and thus
turn to the federal government for
consolation. The psychological fac-
tors of a federal government, foreign
affairs and a defence program has
had a tremendous effect on this early
independent nation striving for a
strong feeling of nationalism.

Prior to the Nigerian Indepen-
dence in 1960, the government was
approached about sending troops to
the Congo and they replied, “We
will send troops when we are inde-
pendent, or not at all.”

Dr. Cole feels that in spite of Pan-
Africanism, “More than any any
other country south of the Sahara,
Nigeria offers possibilities of attain-
ment” of democratic goals similar to
our own.

New York Brass Quintet
Will Appear At VMI

On Monday, the New York Brass
Quintet will be heard in a concert
at 8:15 p.m. in Jackson Memorial
Hall at VMI.

This performance will be the sec-
ond event in the current season of
the Rockbridge Concert Theater
Series.

The New York Brass Quintet com-
prises two trumpets, horn, trombone,
and tuba. The instrumentalists are
all virtuoso musicians in their own
right and are led by Robert Nagel,
the first trumpeter of the group.

The Quintet has been a distin-
guished ensemble in the musical
life of the United States and Canada
for some seasons. In recent years
the group has toured the East, Mid-
west and Southwest and has been
heard twice in concerts at the Li-
brary of Congress.

The music performed by the group
is extremely varied in style and
ranges from early 16th and 17th cen-
tury pieces to compositions by living

kto the alumni requesting information
on their jobs, families, civic activi-
ties and honors, according to Mr.
William C. Washburn, the alumni
secretary.

Information obtained from the re-
turned forms will be compiled by
the University’s IBM data processing
system. Statistical information on
alumni will be available some time
after the start of the second se-
mester, Mr. Washburn said.

Planned for a Year

The occupational file, the first of
its kind for Washington and Lee,
has been in the planning stages for
more than a year. Cards and other
materials will be prepared by the
data processing staff here.

“We feel that Washington and Lee
can provide swift and accurate an-
swers to interested groups and in-
dividuals as a result of our new file,”
Mr. Washburn said. “We hope to
bring these files up to date period-
ically.”

Limited questionnaires have been
mailed to the alumni in previous
years, but the information has never
been coded for use by the University.

Debaters Off To Columbia
For South Carolina Meet

Washington and Lee’s varsity De-
bating Team left yesterday for the
South Carolina Invitational Tourna-
ment at Columbia, S. C.

Bill Noel, Al Eckes, Bill Boardman,
and Charles McCord are the debaters
making the trip with coach William
Chaffin. They will meet teams of
the caliber of Northwestern and
Army. It is the first trip for the var-
sity debaters this year.

Last weekend at Wake Forest,
W&L’s freshmen debaters won six
and lost six debates in a novice
tournament. Both negative and af-
firmative teams broke even in six
debates apiece.

Boulding Will
Talk On Ethics
And Capitalism

The first in a series of three
seminars in religion and eco-
nomics will get underway Tues-
day when a University of
Michigan professor will discuss
“Ethical Problems and Capital-
ist Development.”

Dr. Kenneth E. Boulding, pro-
fessor of economics at Michigan
will speak at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday in
Lee Chapel. His second campus ap-
pearance will be Wednesday at 7:30
p.m. in the chapel when he will
speak on “Ethical Problems and
Socialist Development.”

The special seminars are being
held for the first time this year at
Washington and Lee in place of
the traditional weeklong University
Religious Conference. Other speak-
ers will appear on the campus in
February and April.

Dr. Boulding, a native of England,
received his bachelor of arts degree
with first class honors at Oxford
University. He came to the United
States in 1932 as a Commonwealth
Fellow at the University of Chi-
cago. He began his teaching career
two years later at the University
of Edinburgh but returned to this
country in 1937.

In 1949, he received the John Bates
Clark medal of the American Eno-
nomic Association. He is the author
of six books in the field of econom-
ics, a book of poetry and a book
on philosophy. He has contributed
chapters to two books on religion.

Dr. Boulding is active in the So-
ciety of Friends.

He taught at Colgate, Fisk, Iowa
State and McGill universities before
joining the University of Michigan
faculty in 1949.

 

Disciplinary
Members Will
Be Selected

The Executive Committee is asking
for applications trom the student
body for positions on the Student
Control Committee, a newly organ-
ized committee which will investi-
gate and take action on conduct of-
fenses which are brought to its at-
tention. Two seniors, one junior, one
sophomore, and one law student will
be appointed from these applications
to serve on the committee. The E.C.
urges all responsible students to
apply.

Uncas McThenia, president of the
Student Body, considers this com-
mittee “a step in self-government”
which places a great deal of re-
sponsibility on all students.” Be-
cause the committee will determine
whether more student stelf-discipline
is feasible,” he said. McThenia also
fels that on a student basis, repeat-
ed misconduct can better be averted
before it is carried too far.

*reigning Pomona scholars, and if the

Californians win, rules of the pro-
gram require them to retire as an
unbeaten king of the hill.

The Lexington school, making its
first appearence on the popular net-
work show, will place its hopes in
four bright young men who know
lots of facts and can recall them in
rapid fashion.

They are William R. Anderson,
Jr., Startex, S. C., senior; William
B. Lowry, Jr., Hobbs, N. M.,
junior; James M. Campbell, St.
Petersburgh, Fla., junior; and
Thomas M. Lybass, Jacksonville,
Fla., sophomore. Lowry will serve
as team captain.

All have scholarly interests, often
unrelated to their college majors.
Anderson is majoring in English,
Lowry in philosophy, Campbell in
German, and Lybass in European
History.

They were chosen from among
some 75 candidates who competed
for places on the team and the
weekend in New York that accom-
panies each appearance on the pro-
gram.

Frank A. Parsons, assistant to the
president, was in charge of the selec-
tion, and was subsequently named by
President Fred C. Cole to act as
official “coach” of the team.

Parsons first subjected team can-
candidates to a series of written
quizzes to test the breadth of their
knowledge. Then he had them com-
pete against one another in a ser-
ies of tests which required instan-
taneous oral answers. Extensive rec-
ords were kept, and the finalists
were chosen on the basis of tests
scores and general qualifications
which included their competitive
spirit and ability to react under
pressure.

Parsons says grades made in
classes were not considered in pick-
ing a team, although professors were
asked to recommend students they
considered likely to do well in a
test of knowledge calling for quick
recall of specific fact.

“Very often a candidate would be
an exceptional scholar, but would
lack the ability to think rapidly in
a competitive situation,” Parsons
pointed out. He added quickly that
all four Washington and Lee team
members are indeed good students.
Three—Anderson, Campbell, and
Lowry—hold academic scholarships.

“They all read a great deal, and
this is most important,” Parsons said.

Once the four members were de-
termined, practice sessions were
scheduled almost nightly. A buzzer
system, similar to the one used to
signal answers on the television pro-
gram, was installed in Parsons’ of-
fice, and the team worked long
hours on “buzzer reaction” to “toss-
up” questions.

They also worked on their team-
work in answering “bonus” ques-
tions where team members may con-
sult briefly with one another on the
answer.

Parsons says a supply of some
1,000 toss-up and bonus questions
similar to those asked on the show
was quickly exhausted. Professors
provided other questions, and Par-
sons used questions from a variety
of other sources.

Tape recordings of previous Col-
lege Bowl shows were played for
the team, to familiarize members
with the voice and general charac-
teristics of quizmaster Allen Ludden,

and the general format of the show.

Parsons believes the Washington
and Lee team can match the Pomona
team in general knowledge, but he
thinks the defending champions
will have a decided advantage in
experience and “camera presence.”

A Challenge

We were happy to see the plan for a student disciplinary
committee pass the faculty on Monday. We have heard nothing
but enthusiasm for the plan from the members of the faculty
and administration with whom we have talked lately. It shows
how much trust and respect the faculty is willing to give the
students.

 

But it is an idealistic plan, even on the limited basis upon
which it is being established at present. The future of student-
administered discipline will depend upon the maturity of judg-
ment of the men who are chosen to serve on the new committee.

We urge every student to consider the implications of the
new committee very carefully. The formation of such a group
was an important plank in the platform of the victorious Inde-
pendent Party in last springs elections. The new EC has match-
ed their deeds with their words. Now it is time for the student
body to support the men they have elected. We hope every in-
terested student will apply for a seat on the committee.

It will not be an exciting job, nor can the committee mem-
bers hope to be showered with thanks from their fellow stu-
dents. But we cannot think of a position in which a student
can be of more real service to the University. We desperately
need men who can play a creative role in the shaping of
student disciplinary policy. This is an opportunity the student
body can’t afford to pass up. If we fail, there will be no reason
for the later complaints about discipline.

‘The Five-Star Generals’

Washington and Lee’s College Bowl team goes into Sun-
day’s match against Pomona an underdog. The alert and exper-
ienced Pomona team is a heavy favorite to retire undefeated
from the competition. It will be quite an upset if we win. Come
Sunday though, we’ll be in front of our tubes rooting for the

‘*Five-A Generals.”

Who knows? If we meet with as much success in the College
Bowl as we have on the football field, maybe Higher Educa-
tion or The American Scholar will send a reporter down here
to check on our “program.”

This Walter Bingham of the academic world couldn’t
entitle his story “A Sport for Goof-offs.”” We'd have to drop
“subsidization” of scholars before we earned that title. Re-
member, three of the four College Bowl team members have
academic scholarships.

Dance Board vs. Faculty

Next week’s meeting between the faculty Committee on
Student Social Functions and a delegation from the Execu-
tive Committee may be able to find some workable solution for
the present impasse between the faculty committee and the
Dance Board. (See the adjacent column for the background
on this meeting.)

We respect and admire the faculty committee’s detailed in-
terest in the conduct of the University dance sets, but we feel
they are placing an unnecessary and undesirable pressure on
the Dance Board to maintain the existing pattern on dance
weekends.

We ourselves would not like to see the decorum and formal-
ity which is left even now in the big dances disappear entirely.
But the Dance Board is under a number of very demanding
pressures which make it difficult for the Board to give the stu-
dent subscribers their money’s worth and satisfy the faculty’s
preference in social events at the same time.

To wit:

It is becoming more difficult to hire top-notch performers at
a price we can afford.

Bands that used to cost $2500 are now asking $5000. Re-
cordings, television, and a large student population have vastly
increased the demand for the musicians we want to hear at
WeL.

The dances, as they are set up now, just don’t have any
attraction for most students. This is a manifestation of chang-
ing tastes and we forgo speculation about the reasons, but the
fact remains. We have to live with it.

The reason students buy dance plans at all is the con-
certs. Remember the Dance Board advertisements: “You
save on the price of concerts alone.”” Anyone who is uncon-
vinced has only to compare the attendance at the concerts with
the attendance at the dances to realize this is true.

The Dance Board needs a free hand in arranging the events
of the dance weekends. They cannot give the student body
the most for its money when they are restricted to the present
pattern. We hope the faculty committee will be able to find
some formula for performing its responsibility to the Univer-
sity without placing such a heavy hand on the Dance Board’s
operations.

We know Dr. Cook and the members of his faculty com-
mittee to be an able and understanding group of men. We be-
lieve Mr. Galef, Mr. Young, and the members of the Dance
Board to be an able and responsible group of young men.
But when the students fork over some $20,000 of their own
money for dance sets, we think they ought to be able to decide
what they want to do with it with only broad limits set by
the faculty.

 

Exodus Is
Evidence Of
Poor Parties

By STEVE HENRY

What this campus needs is a good
party.

If you don’t believe it, just take
a look at the number of cars taking
off for North Carolina Germans this
weekend.

Our memory may be failing, but
it seems to us that this is the first
time in recent years that the Wash-
ington and Lee student body has
felt it necessary to make such a
mass exodus to neighboring parties.

Last week it was the University
of Virginia; this week, North Caro-
lina.

The explanation for this phenom-
enon is relatively easy to explain,
We just haven’t had any parties this
fall.

As a matter of fact, this fall has
been the worst party season in many
a year at W&L. With the exception
of Openings Dances, this place has
been as dead as the proverbial dodo.

And everybody knows what boys
do when they want something they
can’t get. They go out and find it,
even if they have to drive all the
way to Carolina to get it.

This, of course is a tragic situation,
and one that needs a solution.

First, let us look at why the prob-
lem has arisen.

In the past, the period from the
opening of school until Christmas
vacation has been the best party
season of all. Not including the
Christmas parties thrown before va-
cation, we used to have at least four
good weekends—combo weekends,
drinking weekends. You know what
we mean.

Openings was a party; Homecom-
ings was a party, and every other
home football game was a party, too.
Those were the good old days.

How sad it is to review the events
of the past three months.

We have had only one good week-
end, the combination Openings-
Homecomings festivities, which ad-
mittedly was a great party, but last-
ed only two days. We have had no
other organized weekend since then.

There have been three home foot-
ball games so far. One was sche-
duled so close to the opening of
school that no one could get or-
ganized quickly enough to have a
party.

One was Homecomings-Openings.

The third was during Parents’
Weekend, which naturally squelch-
ed any possibility of a party week-
end.

So we hvae already blown two
out of three party opportunities this
year, and have blown them through
no fault of our own. Circumstances
were against our partying this fall.

All this leads to the obvious ques-
tion: was all this coincidence planned
long beforehand by the powers-that-
be with an eye toward cutting out,
or at least diminishing, the W&L
party life?

It is a distinct possibility that this
is true. If so, there are bleak years
ahead, party-wise.

However ,all is not lost. Take
heart!

A few more good horror shows
like the one at UVa. last weekend,
and the other schools will be throw-
ing parties for us in Lexington just
to keep us away from their parties.

By BILL ROBERTS
Friday Editor

A meeting that will take place
next week, between the faculty
Committee on Student Social Func-
tions and a delegation from the stu-
dent body Executive Committee,
may have a decisive effect on the

future of the big dance sets.

After the faculty committee had,
reluctantly, approved the Dance
Board’s request for informal dress
at the Saturday night dance Open-
ings weekend, the EC asked for a
meeting with the faculty group for
a general discussion of the dance
sets. Briefly, this is the situation:

The faculty committee has the re-
sponsibility, and the right, to super-
vise student social functions. The
Dance Board has been referring any
proposals it had for changes in the
makeup and conduct of the dance
weekends to the committee.

In the past few years, there have
been quite a few such proposals,
prompted by the Dance Board’s de-
sire to shore up lagging attendance
at the dances in the gym. Last
spring’s omission of the Saturday
night dance and the ruling on in-
formal dress at Openings are the
most recent examples.

Here’s the rub—the Dance Board
has never come across with a re-
quest to the Committee that the
whole pattern of the dance weekend
(formal dance Friday night, con-
cert Saturday afternoon, informal
dance Saturday night) be revised.
Instead they have asked for their

Faculty-EC Meeting Next Week On Dance Sets

changes each time with the under-
standing they would be “just for
this once.” The faculty committee,
which is as unhappy as anyone about
the declining interest in the big
dances, hasn’t liked this method.
They haven’t been sure the Dance
Board was acting in good faith.
Some members of the committee
have rather strongly opposed the
changes which have come up. Tem-
pers have been rubbed very thin
on both sides.

What the EC hopes to do is clear
up the present confusion and see
where everybody stands. It is no
secret that there are quite a few
people in the faculty and adminis-
tration who think that having fra-
ternity combos and a big dance at
school at the same time is a waste
of money. Some of them would like
to rule out fraternity combos when
there is a dance at school. Others
would just as soon abolish the dance
weekends.

It is also no secret that the Dance
Board would like to have more free-
dom to arrange the events on big
weekends. They don’t like having
to submit every change they want
in the present pattern to the faculty
committee. It has been a trying job
for the Dance Board presidents to
try and satisfy both the students and
faculty, who apparently have widely
divergent social function tastes.

What the meeting can do is bring
out the true difference of opinion.
Only then can a mutually satisfac-
tory system be worked out.

 

Page And Wood
In Berlin Debate

The Forensic Union heard a de-
bate between Rosie Page and Robin
Wood Wednesday on the subject,
“Resolved, the United States stand
on the Berlin crisis was not firm
enough.”

Page, arguing the affirmative, told
the 35 members present that the
United States had been “too late
with too little” in response to the
Communist threat to the German
city. Page summarized the develop-
ments in Berlin and pointed out that
the U.S. might have been able to
stop the building of the wall be-
tween the Eastern and Western sec-
tors of Berlin if this nation had
shown the Communists earlier that
“we mean business.” He argued that
the U.S. cannot let the Russians
push us around and that we must
stand and fight for what we believe.

Wood supported his stand for the
negative by pointing out the dangers

of using too much force in the is-|}

sue. If physical force were used, he
warned the Club that World War
II might be started.

Wood suggested that Berlin be
put under UN control until a for-
mal peace is signed and Germany is
unified. He cited the opinions of
some contemporary historians who
are favorable to this plan.

He concluded by stating that Ber-
lin does not represent the proper
place nor the present the proper time
to start a war.

 

Delta Theta Phi Pledges 6

Six law students pledged Delta
Theta Phi legal fraternity last week.
DTP is the second largest legal fra-
ternity in the United States. It had
been inactive on this campus until
two years ago.

Those men pledging were: Larry
Lambert, Norfolk, Va.; Preston Lan-
easter, Farmville, Va.; Mal Lassman,
Brooklyn, N. Y.; Lewis Leigh, Chan-
tilly, Va.; Leonard Sargeant, Mt.
Holly Va.; and Tony Verdream,

Frosh To Hear Sigma Nu
Executive Secretary

Richard Fletcher, Executive Sec-
retary of Sigma Nu, has been asked
by the IFC to speak before the
freshmen pledges on Thursday.

Mr. Fletcher will speak on the
functions of fraternities in campus
life. “The IFC feels that the talk
will give pledges a clearer under-
standing of what their relationship
and attitude should be toward their
fraternities,” stated IFC chairman
Bob Doenges.

Mr. Fletcher has held his posi-
tion with Sigma Nu for five years
and prior to that he worked on the
admissions staff at the University of
Virginia for 19 years. He has also
had experience in journalism and
newspaper work.

The speech will be held in Lee
Chapel at 7 o’clock and all freshmen
are required to attend.

From The EC:
Student Control
Explanation

(Editor’s note—The Executive
Committee released a statement
yesterday on the newly-approved
student disciplinary committee.
The full text appears below.)

The Executive Committee wishes
to express its appreciation publicly
to the Faculty and Administration
for approval of the proposals re-
lating to student conduct.

The recommendation for estab-
lishment of the Student Control
Committee was presented to the
faculty after much discussion by the
Executive Committee and the Ad-
ministrative committee. The request
was made by the Executive Com-
mittee because it is believed that
the student body is willing to as-
sume greater responsibility in the
area of student conduct. In the past
many students have expressed a
strong desire to have student control
in matters of discipline. No longer
are complaints justified that the stu-
dents have no voice in conduct af-
fairs.

The philosophy underlying the
establishment of this group is not
that students will mete out a less
severe punishment than the pres-
ent administrative committee, but
rather to provide a wider range of
student government and to illus-
trate the belief that students are
capable of being treated as mature
citizens. As students exercise total
jurisdiction over matters involv-
ing honor now, it is only another
sign of maturity to exercise con-
trol over other matters of social
conduct.

It is envisioned that this committee
will be more of a preventive than a
corrective body. There are instances
of minor offenses which arise and
are not reported to the present ad-
ministrative committee because they
are not sufficiently serious to merit
disciplinary action. However, after
several such offenses occur and a
student is only then brought before
the Administrative Committee the
results might be severe indeed. If
such matters were dealt with as they
arise it is believed that more serious
consequences might be prevented.

The areas of operation of the Stu-
dent Control Committee will be both
to investigate any reported violation
of gentlemanly conduct, and to ad-
minister any necessary punishment
for the same. If a complaint is re-
ceived from the University proctor,
from the Executive Committee, or
from any nearby school, this com-
mittee will be charged with full re-
sponsibility for dealing with the
matter.

The action of this group will be
subject to review by the Dean of
Students. If he thinks the Com-
mittee has acted unwisely he may
refer the case to the Administra-
tive Committee. Powers of dismis-
sal are not granted to the student
committee, but such a recommen-
mendation may be made to the
Dean of Students if the commit-
tee feels this punishment is war-
ranted.

No formal rules have been formu-
lated for this committee’s operation
because it is believed that each case
must be considered on an individual
basis. Any attempt to formulate a
set of rules or specific penalties for
certain offenses would be doomed to
failure. The present Administrative
Committee has never attempted to
act under any crystallized set of
rules.

If each individual case is con-
sidered with its peculiar attendant
circumstances as fair play and jus-
tice would require it is believed that
a more mature solution would re-
sult.

The Executive Committee would
like to emphasize that the faculty
action giving the student body juris-
diction in this area places a very
great responsibility on the students
of Washington and Lee. It is the
belief of the Executive Committee
that the student body is willing to
meet this challenge.

The opportunity has been provid-
ed for a voice in conduct affairs. It
is hoped that many students will
take a serious interest in this area
of student government for it pro-
vides an apportunity to render an
extremely worthwhile service to the
University.

Applications for positions on the
Student Control Committee are
being received by Steve Suttle,
Secretary of the Student Body,
Delta Tau Delta Fraternity. It is
urged that these applications be
submitted before Thanksgiving.

The Executive Committee sincere-
ly hopes that all applicants are aware
of the extreme careful and mature
deliberation which membership on
the Student Control Committee must
necessarily require.

Sports Editorial
Apology To H-S

Hampden-Sydney students and alumni are reportedly up-
set by a remark attributed to a Washington and Lee faculty
member in the recent Sports Illustrated article on the W&L
athletic system.

Speaking of the 1954 de-emphasis of football, a faculty
member is quoted as saying, ‘“The students were embarrassed
to have schools like Hampden-Sydney as opponents.”

We can see how this remark might be construed as an in-
sult. The title of the article was “A Sport for Gentlemen.”
Washington and Lee is called “a gentleman’s university,’ and
there is a pointed reference to “Washington and Lee types.”
After all this, the remark might easily be interpreted to mean
that it is beneath the dignity of Washington and Lee “gentle-
men” to compete with students from Hampden-Sydney.

We feel sure, however, that it was the intention of neither
the faculty member or the reporter to cast aspersions on the
character of Hampden-Sydney men. The remark referred
soly to the painful transition from big-time football to ama-
teur football.

The remark, far from discrediting Hampden-Sydney, rath-
er reflects the unhealthy atmosphere here at Washington and
Lee before desubsidization. One would have to have a very
distorted sense of values to be “embarrassed” to play Hamp-
den-Sydney when we had been playing the big football mills in

word. Our association with them should enhance rather than

hurt our own reputation.

 

Frosh Basketball Hopefuls
Begin Pre-Season Practice

Washington and Lee will field a
“typical” freshman basketball team
this winter, says frosh coach Joe
Lyles, who as usual faces a rugged
15-game schedule with a squad lack-
ing adequate height for college ball.

Thirty-four candidates turned out
for opening drills Monday night, but
the average height of these 34 is
only 5’10”—a woefully short aver-
age for a college basketball team.

Lyles made his first cut Thursday
night reducing his squad to 25 men
at the present. Another cut will be
made later.

Hustle

“We’re hurting for height,” says
Lyles. “Our biggest man is 6’3” and
only a handful are over 6’.”

“There’s a lot of ability this year,
but it’s mostly at the guards,” he
added. “We’ve got so many good
men at the guards that its hard
to make any decisions this early.”

“What we've got so far is a lot of
hustle and enthusiasm. We’re going
to have to keep it.”

Kowalski, Livingston

Two boys whom Lyles is banking
on for strong front-line play are
6’3” Jerry Kowalski, and 6’2” Dick
Livingston.

Kowalski is the brother of Ken
Kowalski, a starter for last year’s
varsity Generals. A good rebounder,
Jerry shoots adequately from the
corners and operates well around

the backboard.

Livingston moves to Washington
and Lee after a fine senior year at
Fishburne Military School, where he
led the FMS squad in scoring. In
two outings against the Washington
and Lee freshmen last year, Livings-
ton hit for over 20 points.

Another forward who has looked
good so far is George Madison, who
played his high school basketball
for Bastrop (La.), where he was an
all-district first team choice his sen-
ior year.

Lyles has an abundance of ade-
quate backcourt performers ready
to go this year.

He named No Leigh, Scott Ver-
non, Girard Jolyn, and Vic Nunan

With the I-M Football Program
drawing to a close, the bowling
and wrestling leagues have com-
pleted their first week of action.
Bowling is held every Tuesday night,
while wrestling takes place on both
Tuesday and Thursday.

On November 7, four bowling
contests were held. Pi Phi, Phi Kap,
and Beta all won their matches easi-
ly. Pi Phi downed their counterparts
from KA 3-1, while the bowlers from
Beta House defeated Lambda Chi
also by 3-1.

In the first match of the evening
Sigma Chi played the representa-
tives from the Law School to a
2-2 draw. The post-grads had the
higher pin total—2108 to 2089.

Completely overpowering its op-
ponents, Phi Kap easily downed an
unbalanced ZBT unit 4-0. Jim Brus-
sard led the victors with games of
159, 171, and 189.

For ZBT Vic Galef was out-
standing as he had a 188 average
for the night. Vic is considered one
of the best bowlers enrolled in W&L
in a number of years.

Sewanee Biggest Test
On Generals’ Schedule

Washington and Lee meets Se-| of two All-Americans at Tennessee,

wanee Saturday in what has to be
the biggest game of the season for
both teams.

For one things, both teams are

‘| undefeated in the current campaign,

Washington and Lee with a record
of 6-0, Sewanee with a mark of
5-0-1.

For another, Sewanee was the last
team to beat the Generals, squeez-
ing out a 15-14 win in fog and rain
in mid-November in 1959. The Gen-
erals went on to win their last game
of the 1959 season, and except for
a tie at mid-season last year, they
have been all-victorious since.

If the Generals win or tie at
Sewanee Saturday, it will give
Washington and Lee a new school
record of 17 games without a loss,
bettering a mark which was fashion-
ed in 1914-15.

But the aspect of the contest that
just might move the Generals to
their best efforts is the prospect of
providing Coach Lee McLaughlin
with a win that will bring his col-
lege coaching ledger at all even at
19-19-2 in his fifth season. It will
be recalled that McLaughlin was
1-15 after two years in the business.

Last year, the Generals pasted the
Tigers a good one, winning 32-8
at Wilson Field. McLaughlin isn’t
letting his boys think much about
the ease of that one, for he said at
the time that the young Sewanee
team would be tough to handle in
1961.

Shirley Majors, the nationally
famed coach of the Tigers, has made
a prophet of McLaughlin. The father

 

Majors has No. 4 son playing an
important tailback spot for Sewanee’s
powerful single wing offense. And
the rest of the Tiger squad is ex-
perienced and talented, scout Buck
Leslie reports.

“This could very well be our
toughest game,” McLaughlin points
out. “Sewanee may not have the
physical strength that Emory and
Henry possessed, but it looks as
though they are capable of putting
more points on the scoreboard.”

The two teams have faced three
common opponents. Sewanee de-
feated Hampden-Sydney, 21-9, Ran-
dolph-Macon, 21-0, and Centre, 41-
0. The Generals have won over
Hampden-Sydney, 7-6, Randolph-
Macon, 48-0, and Centre, 53-0.

McLaughlin is quick to discount
any edge comparative scores might
give the Generals. “We've been very
fortunate in our scoring offorts,”
he says. “We've gotten some points
on our own, but our opponents have
given us plenty of help.”

The Generals’ Doug Martin, a
155-pound fullback, has moved up
to his accustomed place as leading
rusher. Last year as a first unit
man, Martin gained 619 yards at 6.9
a carry. This year, he runs on the
second unit and has accumulated
216 yards at 6.5 a carry. In W&L’s
win over Centre, Martin carried only
twice, but they were touchdown
scampers of eight and 24 yards. He
leads all W&L scorers with 38 points.

Injuries have made their first
appreciable dent in the W&L squad

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Frosh Offense Is Shaping Up;
First Touchdown Of Year Made

Washington and Lee’s freshman
football team finally demonstrated
its offense last week after four un-
successful attempts.

The Baby Generals tallied their
first touchdown of the season on a
70-yard sustained drive, the last
seven yards being covered by a
pass from quarterback Sam Simp-
son to halfback Bill David. Despite
their newly-found offensive muscles,
the Baby Generals lost their fifth
straight game, a 28-7 decision to
Fork Union Military Academy.

Freshman coach Dana Swan, who
is very enthusiastic over his team’s
offensive showing last week, says:
“I think our offense will continue to
jell and do bigger and better things.”

The object of these “bigger and
better things” is Greenbrier Military
School, which meets the Baby Gen-
erals Friday on Wilson Field here.

Greenbrier, third in the Virginia
Military League, specializes in strong
end sweeps and outside and inside
belly runs on offense. They aren’t
afraid to pass if necessary and pos-
sess what Swan describes as “a
pretty potent” quick pass.

Swan points out that Greenbrier
uses a sort of pro type defense
which may bother his boys.

“Greenbrier moves its middle
guard in the slot between guard
and center and gives you the run-
ning play at him,” Swan said. “This
defense and Greenbrier’s good ag-
gressive, fast line could cause us
considerable trouble, unless we can
adjust.”

The old injury problem is still
plaguing the Baby Generals. Swan
says his squad is down to 21 or 22
players now. End Bob Dyer was
sidelined Monday when he broke his
hand.

Although Fork Union slapped

W&L rather hard, Swan has nothing
but praise for his boys.

“There wasn’t a man on the team
who didn’t do something good
against Fork Union,” he said.

Swan especially complimented end
John Molyneaux, who took over the
punting when regular punter Doug
Davis separated his shoulder against
Chowan Jr. College two weeks ago.

“Molyneaux’s punting was terri-
fic,” Swan said. “He averaged 38
yards a punt, kicking the ball be-
tween the opponents’ chins, legs and
just everywhere.”

After Greenbrier, the Baby Gen-
erals have one game remaining—a
Nov. 17 clash with Staunton Military
Academy here.

losses was to tournament champ
Pittsburgh.

This week, however, films will
definitely be made and will be shown
for the benefit of the entire student
body.

POVERTY CAN BE FUN

It is no disgrace to be poor. It is an error, but it is no disgrace.

So if your purse is empty, do not skulk and brood and hide
your head in shame. Stand tall. Admit your poverty. Admit it
freely and frankly and all kinds of good things will happen to
you. Take, for instance, the case of Blossom Sigafoos.

Blossom, an impecunious freshman at an Eastern girls’
college, was smart as a whip and round as a dumpling, and
scarcely a day went by when she didn’t get invited to a party
weekend at one of the nearby men’s schools. But Blossom never
accepted. She did not have the rail fare; she did not have the
clothes. Weekend after weekend, while her classmates went
frolicking, Blossom sat alone, saved from utter despair only
by her pack of Marlboros, for even an exchequer as slim as
Blossom’s can afford the joys of Marlboro—joys far beyond
their paltry price: rich, mellow tobaccos, lovingly cured and
carefully packed, and an exclusive selectrate filter. Croesus
himself could not buy a better cigarette!

However, Marlboro’s most passionate admirers—among
whose number I am paid to count myself —would not claim that
Marlboro can entirely replace love and romance, and Blossom
grew steadily moroser.

Then one day came a phone call from an intelligent sopho-
more named Tom O’Shanter at a nearby men’s college. “Blos-
som,” said Tom, “I want you to come down next week for the
barley festival, and I won’t take no for an answer.”

“No,” said Blossom,

“Foolish girl,” said Tom gently. “I know why you refuse
me. It is because you are poor, isn’t it?”

“Yes,” said Blossom.

“T will send you a railroad ticket,” said Tom. “Also a hard-
boiled egg in case you get hungry on the train.”

“But I have nothing to wear,” said Blossom.

Tom replied, “‘I will send you one suit of cashmere, two gowns
of lace, three slacks of velvet, four shoes of calf, five socks of
nylon, and a partridge in a pear tree.”

“That is most kind,” said Blossom, “but I fear I cannot
dance and enjoy myself while back home my poor lame brother
Tiny Tim lies abed.”’

“Send him to Mayo Brothers and put it on my tab,” said Tom.

“You are terribly decent,” said Blossom, “but I cannot
come to your party because all the other girls at the party
will be from rich, distinguished families, and my father is but
a humble woodcutter.”’

“T will buy him Yosemite,” said Tom.

“You have a great heart,” said Blossom. ‘Hold the phone
while I ask our wise and kindly old Dean of Women whether it
is proper for me to accept all these gifts.”

She went forthwith and asked the Dean of Women, and the
Dean of Women laid her wise and kindly old hand on Blossom’s
cheek and said, “Child, let not false pride rob you of happiness.
Accept these gifts from Tom.”

“Oh. bless you, Wise and Kindly,” breathed Blossom,
dropping grateful tears into the Dean’s reticule. “I must run
and tell Tom.”

“Yes, run, child,” said the Dean, a smile wrinkling her wise
and kindly old eyes. ‘And ask him has he got an older brother,”

EMPHASIS

EC Proposals Reviewed;
Opinions Given

By TOM RAINS
Tuesday Staff Writer

On February 1, 1961 there appeared in circulation about the campus the
first issue of Protest, a student publication.

The purpose of this publication was to bring to the attention of the stu-
dent body those areas of operation in the student government and any other
phase of student activity, of which the student body at large was in-
cognizant.

Protest was successful in revealing various points of interest which in
its opinion were in need of revision or replacement in the hand book of
the student body. The climax of the discussion of these issues was reached
at the time of the student body elections last Spring, thus provoking one
of the most controversial campaigns in the history of the student body.

For the first time the candidates for the top three offices in the student
government issued platforms, calling for various revisions and replacements
of certain articles in the student handbook.

By this time—a full three months after the issue of Protest—the student
body was well aware of the need of revision in the student constitution of
Washington and Lee University.

Proposals Listed
Some of the proposals which were made in the platforms of the last
spring’s elections are similar to recent suggestions. These include:
1. Limiting the powers of the Assimilation Committee to the Cam-
pus.
2. Revitalizing the Cold Check Committee.

3. The formation of a student committee to advise students who
have been guilty of misconduct. (Passed at the Faculty Meeting last
week.)

4. Changing the nominating convention procedure so that more
men’s names may appear on the ballot.

5. Broadening the base of student government through some form
of legislation such as a student senate.

6. Opening the Executive Committee meetings, other than honor
trials, to the public, and publishing the minutes of these meetings.

7. Formation of a committee to study constitutional revision.
8. The instigation of a poll tax as an incentive to student vote.

9. Giving prospective candidates for election tests which cover in-
telligence and general ability, initiative, resourcefulness and crea-
tive agility, and leadership ability.

Student Opinion

Various student opinions have appeared on the first of these proposals;
some students think that conventional dress, to be specific, should be
limited to the campus, while others believe that conventional dress should
be abolished altogether.

It is the general feeling of the faculty who were asked their opinion
that the dress rules should remain. Without question it does give us dis-
tinction from some of the state universities. However, the main opinion
seems to be that reference to the Assimilation Committee “rules” should be
made as such and not as “traditions.” “Custom suggests, but never dictates,”
one professor pointed out.

Much Discussed

Much discussion has taken place on the formation of a student com-
mittee to advise students who are guilty of misconduct. This proposal
was passed at a faculty meeting held last week, which, in effect, gave the
green light to the first of the new proposals offered by those men elected in
last Spring’s campus election.

A number of faculty members whose opinions were sought revealed
that a few professors felt that students would be incapable to serve on
such a committee.

One opinion was expressed that a position on this committee would
degenerate into mere political office thereby allowing political power to
operate in disciplinary action taken upon a student.

Faculty Ideas

A few of the faculty members whose opinions were sought indicated
that students are often inclined to be too lenient with their friends, or
that they are afraid of being too lenient and thus unbearably strict.

In regard to changing the procedure of the nominating convention so
that two student’s names appear on the general election ballot, the opinion
was expressed by both faculty and students that this change should be
made. This would allow a third political party, if such existed to offer
their candidate for election.

Regarding the opening of the Executive Committee meetings, other
than those dealing with honor cases, to the public and publishing the
minutes of these meetings, a general opinion seems to favor this.

No Official Action

To date, no official action has been taken on any of these proposals
(save the Disciplinary Committee and publishing the minutes o fthe EC
meeting) except the formation of a Reform Committee by the EC, headed
by Secretary of the Student Body Steve Suttle. This committee is consid-
ering each of these proposals which have been mentioned here.

Proposals should be submitted in writing, accompanied by a reason for
them, to Steve Suttle or sent to the Executive Committee by November 22,
1961.

It is the plan of the Reform Committee to study these proposals and
submit them to the Executive Committee for voting.

The voting will be carried out in accordance with the present constitu-
tion,

The general theme of the discus-

this nation have a Christianity all
their own, if they have any at all,
consisting in a compromise of basic
Christian doctrine and contemporary
political and economic theories.

The second lecture in the series

will be given by the Rev. John C.

These are questions which many
students have been asking, and
which the University Christian As-

answering. This is one of the main
reasons that the U.C.A. is sponsor-
ing a series of lectures and discus-

may gain a better insight into their
own opinions, and may challenge
opposing ones while strengthening
their own.

It is hoped that each student par-

that they will become, and continue
to be an important part in the stu-
dent’s life, a U.C.A. spokesman said.

anonymous donor, the Research Fund gave aid to 25 students

 

During the first year of its oper-
ation approximately 25 students
were engaged in various projects in
the sciences, humanities, and social
sciences. Since the program could
not be put into effect without care-
ful planning, most of the projects
were carried out largely during the
second semester.

Reports from students and profes-
sors involved indicated that the pro-
gram was unusually successful, and
it received favorable publicity in
the New York Times and the Amer-
ican Council of Learned Societies
Newsletter. It is being carried on in
an expanded basis this year.

The grants are made to stu-
dents in two different fields. The
first is aiding a professor in his re-
search, The second is conducting a
project with the professor’s guid-
ance. Both the professors and stu-
dents involved should benefit from
the research.

Boulding Begins Seminar Tonight

By C. C, FLIPPEN
Associate Editor

Dr. Kenneth E. Boulding, noted economist and
author, opens a two-part series of lectures here
tonight on ethics and its application to modern econo-
my.

Speaking at 7:30 from Lee Chapel, Dr. Boulding will
discuss “Ethical Problems and Capitalist Develop-
ment.” The second lecture on “Ethical Problems and
Socialist Development” will be given tomorrow at
7:30 p.m. in the chapel.

This seminar is the first in a series of three to be
sponsored jointly by the Washington and Lee de-
partments of religion and economics. It will replace
the traditional University Religious Conference week.
Other speakers are to appear in February and April.

In addition to his regularly scheduled evening
lectures, Dr. Boulding will speak to a combined
class of economics students tomorrow at 12:05 in
Newcomb 8. This talk is open to anyone who may
wish to attend. He also spoke to economics and
religious classes this morning.

Dr. Boulding, professor of economics at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, is a native of England. He came
to this country for advanced study in 1932 after
graduating from Oxford University. Later he returned
to teach here and in 1948 became a United States
citizen.

In 1941-42, he served as economist with the League

of Nations and later on the Committee for Economic
Development, Chicago, Illinois.
The American Economic Association awarded the
John Bates Clark Medal to him in 1949. This award
is made bienially to an economist under forty who
has made an outstanding contribution to his field.
Later he worked at the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavoral Sciences at Stanford, California.
Two years ago he served as visiting professor
head of the economics department
College of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamacia.
Among his many works in economics are, A Re-
construction of Economics (1950), The Organizational
Revolution, (1953), and The Skills of the Economist
(1958). He has also contributed chapters to several
books on religion. In addition to these works, he has

and
at the University

published a book of poetry, There is a Spirit, and a
book of philosophy, The Image.

Before joining the faculty at Michigan, Dr. Bould-
ing taught the universities of Edinburgh, Iowa State,
Colgate, Fisk and McGill.

Recognized as an authority by economists and
theologians throughout the world, he is a member
of numerous organizations composed of men in these
fields. Among the groups he is associated with are:
the American Economic Association, Royal Economic
Society, American Association of University Profes-
sors, the American Association for the Advancement

of Science, and the Society of Friends.

Honor System Not Ours To Do With As We Please, It Is Only Ours To Preserve

Editor’s note: The Tuesday Edition is very fortu-
nate in having the following article concerning our
honor system available for publication.

With the question of campus politics, and of the
honor system by nature of campus politics, again
coming to the fore, we feel that the following evaluation
is of particular significance at this time. The article was
written by W&L’s Dr. Sidney M. B. Coulling, an assist-
ant professor of English.

We sincerely appreciate Dr. Coulling’s interest and
that time he has given the Tuesday Edition, and we
would hope that the student body pays particular at-
tention to Dr. Coulling’s effort.

We feel that this article expresses this paper’s opin-
ion about the honor system, and we submit it as “‘edi-
torial comment.”’ Our regular editorials will appear next
week,

By DR. SIDNEY M. B. COULLING
Assistant Professor of English

If everyone who knows Washington and Lee well were asked to se-
lect the single most valuable asset of the University, I have little doubt
that the choice would be almost unanimous—our honor system.

From time to time, I know, there has been vigorous competition from
other quarters: a Gator Bowl football team, a sensationally success-
ful group on the Quiz Bowl, an historian of international fame, a new
endowment enthusiastically applauded by educators throughout the

country. But year in and year out it has been the honor system, more »

than anything else, that has placed Washington and Lee in its distin-
guished position in American education.

It is the honor system that has made possible much of the
characteristic life of the college community, from unproctored ex-
aminations to the unquestioning acceptance of student checks.

It is the honor system that has helped to create an environment
in which serious intellectual pursuits are possible and in which
excellence is respected. And, as I learned once again last summer
when I was among Washington and Lee’s representatives at a con-
ference in Colorado Springs, it is the honor system that attracts
more praise and more interest, among students and educators from
New England to California, than anything else that can be men-
tioned about the University.

Don’t Forget ‘Why’ of Honor System

This is so because, of all we can boast of here, our genuinely ef-
fective honor system is the one thing that is shared by only a handful
of institutions in the nation.

All of this seems so obvious that it hardly needs to be said. And yet
in recent years I have increasingly sensed that we do not sufficiently ap-
preciate the true importance of the honor system. Even with the scan-
dal of the early fifties only a decade behind us we are prone to re-
gard the honor system with complacency, to accept it as the natural
course of things, to consider it simply as something else here that is old
and traditional.

Too many of us, I am afraid, are either unaware or forgetful of what
exists where there is no honor system, casually dismissing the matter
with the tired witticism about the faculty with the honor and the stu-
dents with the system. We tend to think that inevitably Washington and
Lee will always have an honor system, and that the loss or weakening
of the honor system “can never happen here.” Or, if I may judge by the
themes I read now and then, we are tempted to speak of “the three great
Washington and Lee traditions—conventional dress, the speaking tra-
dition, and the honor system,” as if the student’s integrity is on the
same level of importance as his custom of wearing a jacket and speak-
ing to his friends.

If I regard our honor system as pre-eminently important, the
reason is that I have had first-hand experience with the immense
problems that are created in institutions with inadequate honor
systems or no honor system at all. My first teaching assignment, for
example, was at a large southern university which had an honor
system supported largely by elaborate rhetorical claims.

Once when I reported a student for submitting an essay that he
had copied from the New York Herald Tribune I caused a stir
which affected the entire campus and lasted for weeks. Although
the penalty for such an offence—failure in the course and expulsion
for a semester—was clearly and explicitly stated in a book of regu-
lations, the student and administrative authorities sought every
possible evasion.

No one seemed too remote from the case to help decide it: no testi-
mony was too irrelevant to include. The student’s minister at home
wrote to say that his family were pillars of the church; his dormitory
counselor testified that he rarely kept late hours or created disturb-
ances; and some of his other professors said that in class he seemed
pleasant and attentive. Eventually 1 was notified by a dean that since
most of the evidence pointed to the conclusion that the accused was
really a prince of a fellow who had somehow mistaken an article in
the Herald Tribune for one of his own essays, I should forget the whole
matter and permit the student to write another paper.

Cheating Condoned Elsewhere

At a second institution where I taught there was not even the pre-
tense of an honor system, for the students were so accomplished in de-
ception that the faculty and administration had long since abandoned
any serious attempt to deal with the problem. One of my students, a
third-string fullback who had made himself valuable as the extra-point
specialist, was so skillfully assisted in his work that only late in the
semester, and then by accident, did I discover that in reality he was
scarcely literate. Another student was a cheater so clumsy that he was
repeating English 1 for the fourth time, but he was beginning to learn.
He came to class one day to write an impromptu theme, pulled out an
old issue of The Reader’s Digest, and began copying one of its articles
of condensed but lasting interest. When I challenged him he replied that
he was merely taking notes in preparation for the paper—the paper he
was supposed to be writing at that very moment! Both of us knew this
was an outrageous lie, but both also knew that I was utterly powerless
to do anything about it. Had I tried to take the matter to the adminis-
tration I would have experienced the same treatment which a colleague
of mine received when he attempted to press an honor case. He was ac-
cused by his dean of being a trouble maker and was encouraged to seek
a teaching position elsewhere.

However absurd such accidents may seem, however foreign they are
to our experience at Washington and Lee, it is salutary to be reminded
that such things can and do happen every day on campuses throughout
the country. If we are to speak of the honor system with something other
than glibness and complacency, we must always keep in mind what the
absence of an honor system can do: it can sap the vitality of an institu-
tion; it can make a travesty of the whole educational process; it can
create an atmosphere of mutual hostility between faculty and students
and demoralize everyone by establishing a mood of cynicism and futility.

I have insisted on this point because I believe there is danger
in complacency. But there is a second danger, I think, still more
serious—the tendency, apparently growing in recent years, to sub-
ject the honor system to a scrutiny that obscures rather than illum-
inates. I do not mean that we should never examine or discuss the
honor system. Certainly the lively debate of this past spring was a
good and healthful sign. Nor do I mean that the honor system is
sacred or perfect, that it should be immune from criticism.

If there are faults and weaknesses then by all means they
should be corrected. But there is a difference between an examina-
tion of the honor system that is useful and an examination of it
that is not, and it has seemed to me that we have not always ob-
served this distinction.

What Is Honor?

In the past few months, for example, I have heard the complaint that
in applying the honor system we face a vast difficulty because of our in-
ability to define what we mean by honor. I hope that I am not being
semantically naive when I say that I cannot believe we have any real
difficulty here. I think that we know in general what we mean by the
word, and even if we cannot adequately define it we at least know what
is not honest. We know that lying and stealing and cheating are not
honest, and we know what lying and stealing and cheating are. The
honor system was never intended to be the object of metaphysical or
semantic speculation. It is a very practical system of assuring that hon-
orable behavior shall be the rule of life here, and to introduce into it
questions which lie outside its province is to weaken it without pur-

 

pose.

A second kind of unhelpful criticism is the demand to have the
application of the honor system described in the most minute de-
tails, to indicate precisely the boundary between the area where it
applies and the area where it does not apply.

We need, of course, to know where we stand, and obviously we must
state what offenses are punishable and what are not. But there is a

danger in wishing to be too specific. Just as the desire to know exactly
what pages of the text are included in the examination material en-
courages one to study only what is absolutely essential, so too does the
insistence on minutely describing the application of the honor system
encourage one to avoid any unnecessary honesty. Again I hope that I
am not being naive when I say that I think we know the area
covered by the honor system. Its strength, we are accustomed to repeat-
ing, lies in its not being overloaded, in its applying to a fairly restricted
and well-defined area. But this has always meant that the honor system
is strong because it has not attempted to regulate social conduct. It has
never meant that the honor system is strong because it does not demand
too much honor of a student. It has never meant that honor can be com-
partmentalized, that stealing in a dormitory is forbidden but stealing in
a fraternity house is permissible. The word integrity suggests, etymolog-
ically, wholeness. We cannot have this “wholeness” if our concern is with
discovering what dishonorable deeds we can get by with rather than
with being honorable in all that we say and do.

W&L Supports Honor System

Whatever may have been the inadequacies of Washington and Lee
students, they have at least made one great and enduring contribution
that is the bedrock of everything else—they have developed, admin-
istered, supported, and maintained the honor system as a vital force in the
University.

If the present and future students wish to make a contribution,
they can make no more significant one than continuing the same
tradition. But one thing they may not do. They may not regard the
honor system as their exclusive possession. It is not theirs alone; it
belongs to every student who through the years has faithfully
helped establish it as an integral part of our lives. For this reason
the enjoyment of it is not simply a right and a privilege, but a
solemn responsibility.

As Ruskin said of the architecture of the past, the honor system is not
ours to do with as we please; it is ours only to preserve.

Fraternities
Seek Agency
For Buying

By GEORGE HONTS
Tuesday Columnist

There has been talk on the cam-
pus for the past few months about
fraternities inves-
tigating the pos-
sibility of estab-
lishing a central
purchasing agency
for themselves.
The idea behind
the agency is a
basic and much
needed one: that
is to reduce the
expenses which
fraternities incur
over the year on
major items such as food and furni-
ture and incidental items ranging
from light bulbs to toilet paper.

Several student leaders are inter-
ested in the establishment of such
an agency. Without freshmen pay-
ing board bills many fraternities are
in a financial pinch, and establish-
ment of a central purchasing and
distributing agency has the potential
of greatly lowering the cost of run-
ning a fraternity. After all Lexing-
ton merchants have their own skins
to care for and they cannot give
discounts in proportion to the sav-
ings a wholesale house could offer.

 

   

Honts

One student suggested such an
agency might be able to lower the
costs to the point that a dietician
and director might be hired to
handle the agency on behalf of
the fraternities and thus guarantee
efficency of operation as well as
the quality of the produce handled.

The IFC has been seeking an area
in which it can exert some real in-
fluence and power. The investigation
of the possibilities of such an agency
and the establishment of it—if it is
worthwhile—strikes me as being an
excellent point of departure for the
IFC. It would be in the interest of
every fraternity man to see if some
action could not be taken on the
matter.

 

Palace Palace for some liquid re-
freshments.

Before we could take the first
sip, a short, fat fellow in a tux
bustled in and introduced himself
as Harry Happyface.

“Hurry, hurry, hurry,” he said,
“you’re going to be late for the
A.A.A. Convention.” We certainly
didn’t want to be late for the
A.A.A. Convention, so we followed
him.

Over the door to the building,
carved in marble, was the sign,
“Association of American Arsonists.”
As we went in, the brotherhood
were singing their fight song:

Oh, happy, carfree arsonists. We—
Go into the forest, set fire to a tree.

Fires in the city, fires in the town,
Burn the whole damn world to the
ground.

Property damage, fire loss, we don’t
care—

Singe the fur on our enemy, Smokey
the Bear.

Everyone then sat down to their
dinner of shis-kabob with cherries
jubliee for desert. Your reporters
made the mistake of taking out
cigerattes after the meal; the waiter
was there quick as a flash to light
them—with a blow torch.

Miss Arme Pitt got up to intro-
duce the principle speaker, Melvin
Monotone, who spoke on how to
throw a real housewarming.

We started to doze, but were
rudely awaken as Harry Happy-
face set our coats on fire. We
got them off and stamped them
out, to the obvious disappointment
of the entire audience.

At that moment, the waiters
wheeled in a huge cake. As the
band played, “Smoke Gets in Your
Eyes,” a curvacious blonde lept
out of the cake. The audience was
disappointed until she stepped in a
plate of crepe suzette and went
up in flames.

A distinct aroma of burning flesh
crept over the room as your report-
ers made their way toward the
exit. The conventioners began to
grow frisky and were tossing Molo-
tov cocktails at one another.

We stood for a moment amid the
rubble that once was the A.A.A.

Students Wonder:
What Can We Do?

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

As all of you no doubt realize,
there are many crises extant in the
world today.

The problem we
face as_ college
students is what
to do?

For sometime
now, for example,
I have been wond-
ering what to do
about fall-out.
Hair restorers are
ineffective at best,
and wigs are too
expensive. Just
recently, however, I have noticed a
new kind of fall-out is in the news
constantly. The solution to this
problem, and the _ sub-problems
which it brings along as lethal by-
products, is fortunately much simp-
ler than my own immediate problem.

As a matter of fact, the solution
to the radioactive fall-out prob-
lem is so simple that I'm ashamed
of myself for not thinking of it.
Since I know everyone is inter-
ested in this sort of thing, I won’t
hold the solution back any longer.

This is the second in a series of
articles featuring happenings of in-

 

CO-EDS!
WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR CHILD
TO LOOK LIKE THIS? (Then came
the drawing). The general body of
the advertisement was as follows:

“This is an example of what radio-
active fall-out can do to the future
generations. CO-EDS, FIGHT
BACK! You can fight back now. The
Russians have polluted the atmos-
phere with radioactive material,
which will fall on us with the
spring rains. You don’t have to be
told what this will do to our future
generations. The results of the ter-
rible rays will be disastrous to chil-
dren whose existence begins after
the spring rains.

BUT—If you act before the
spring rains bring the horrible
mutating scourge of fall-out upon
us, your baby need not run the
risk of being a mutant freak. We,
the members of the Society for the
Transmission of Unmutated Des-
cendants (STUD), Limited, deter-
minded to save YOUR CHILDREN
from this scourge, and avoid for
YOU the untold sorrow which
awaits the barren, have combined
to assist YOU in preserving our
race, so that together we may af-
firm our belief in fundamental hu-
man rights and dignity and worth
of the human person as he exists,
and permit him to exist in the fu-
ture.

Several days ago, while looking
over the morning mail, I ran across
a letter from a friend of mine at
LSU which contained a circular
which is being passed around that

subsidized campus.

“You need not see this last op-
portunity to see healthy grandchil-
dren slip away. Call STUD for an
appointment with the future. We will
not fail you. Will you fail the future
of your country and your unselfish
forefathers?”

Indicative of Spirit

This is the kind of thing that I
like to see our generation doing, and
I think it is indicative of the spirit
which is sweeping college campuses
across the nation. And I think that
we should start a chapter of STUD
here at Washington and Lee so the
poor girls at Hollins and Sweet
Briar, and those other schools won’t
have to go all the way to Louisiana
to perform their patriotic duty.

The first five men to call the Uni-
versity Development Office on Wed-
nesday morning will be signed up,
and if we see later on that the work
is too much for us then we'll taken
on a few provisional members. And
those of you who aren’t chosen
should feel free to work as inde-
pendent agents or free-lance oper-
ators.

GENERALS RANKED 14TH IN SMALL COLLEGES

 

Coach Lee McLaughlin’s “football-in-depth” process paid
off again for his 45-Star Generals Saturday. Coach Mac,
utilizing his four platoons of talented gridiron performers,
wore down a fired-up, previously-unbeaten University of the
South team as the still-unbeaten Generals registered an impres-
sive 26-8 win on the losers field.

The victory, W&L’s seventh this*
season, removed a major obstacle in
the Generals’ quest for a second
straight undefeated season. They are
generally favored to top the two
remaining foes on the schedule,
Frederick College and Washington
University of St. Louis.

New Record

The triumph also set a new school
record for most consecutive games
played without a loss. The win over
Sewanee ran _ the Generals’ un-

“TI don’t see where Terry has
room for improvement,” said Coach
Lee McLaughlin.

No Letdown

“It has to be Fohs,” said Coach
Mac in picking this week’s Sport
Star of the week. “What amazes me
most of all about Terry,” Coach
Mac added, “is that he is so con-
sistent. You’d expect anyone to have
a bad game once in a while, but not

And the win enabled the Gener-

absorbed at Sewanee in a _ fog-
marred battle two years ago—the
last time a Washington and Lee team

Greenbrier Blanks Baby Generals;
Final Game With Staunton Friday

Washington and Lee’s freshman
gridders were again held scoreless
as they fell to Greenbrier Military
Academy on Friday, 20-0.

No Offense

After a scoreless first quarter
Greenbrier scored its first touch-
down in the second period, after
a long drive, on a 4-yard end run.
A two point conversion was success-
ful and at the close of the first half
the score stood at 8-0 for GMA.

third quarter after grabbing a Bill
David fumble on W&L’s 15-yard

After an almost even fourth quar-
ter, Greenbrier scored on a 2-yard
fullback plunge with 50 seconds re-
maining. The final conversion at-

closed with W&L 0, Greenbrier 20.

test might go the other way dur-
ing its early stages. The Generals
were stopped several times in the
first half by the inspired Sewanee
defense after marching deep into
scoring territory.

The best the Big Blue could do
was a field goal, and they didn’t get
that until midway through the sec-
ond period. At this point, halfback
Jim Russ took advantage of a back
wind to boot a 36-yarder that gave
the Generals a 3-0 lead.

In the second half, however, it
was a different story as the fresh-
er W&L charges dominated the
game. Charley Gummey returned
a punt 39 yards to the Sewanee
19-yard line, sending the stalling
General offense into gear for the
first time during the afternoon.
W&L moved to a first down in two
plays. Then quarterback Steve
Suttle, starting on the nine yard
stripe, found a spot behind a wall
of W&L blockers and_ scooted

 

untouched into the end zone.
Doug Martin smashed off tackle
for the two point conversion and
the Generals led 11-0.

The Washington and Lee defense
held explosive Sewanee, Generals
Terry Fohs and Bill Wheeler spark-
plugging the resistance, until the
offense took over again in the fourth
stanza. The Big Blue moved 38
yards in seven plays to set up a
four-yard scoring plunge by Tommy
Keesee. Gummey pushed the W&L
advantage to 19-0 on the conver-
sion.

W&l Stomps Sewanee For llth Win In Row

Lone Score

Sewanee, weary of their failure to
gain on the ground against the
stubborn General defense, took to
the air and found—as have several
W&L opponents—the going a little
easier. The Tigers connected on five
of six passes, the last one a seven-
yard toss that was good for the lone
Sewanee tally. The losers added two

IT’S LATER THAN YOU THINK!

All year long you’ve been promising yourself to go there. Now
the semester is nearly over and you still haven’t set foot in the

place. Shame on you!

But it’s not too late. Right now, this very minute, before
you weaken, lift up your head and forward march to the place
you have been avoiding ever since school began. I refer, of

course, to the library.

Now here you are at the library. That wasn’t so bad, was
it? Of course not! Go inside. What do you see? A sign that says
“NO SMOKING.” Go outside. Light a Marlboro. Smoke.

Go back inside.

Because now you are ready. Now your trembling resolution
is rigid. Now your pulsing psyche is serene. You have been
calmed by mild Marlboro. You have been soothed by that fine
selectrate filter, by that fine full flavor that dotes and pampers
and caresses, that lifts the fallen, repairs the shattered, straight-
ens the bent, unravels the knotted, rights the askew, and

fastens the unbuttoned.

In the center of the library you see the main circulation desk.
Look in the card catalogue for the number of the book you
want, write the number on a slip, and hand it to the efficient
and obliging young lady at the desk. The efficient and obliging
young lady then gives the slip to an efficient and obliging page
boy who trots briskly back into the stacks, curls up on a limp
leather encyclopedia, and sleeps for an hour or two. Then,
puffy but refreshed, he returns your slip to the efficient and
obliging young lady at the desk, who tells you one of three
things: a) “Your book is out.”’ ’b) “Your book is at the bindery.”

c) “Your book is on reserve.’

Having learned that the circulation desk hasn’t the least
intention of ever parting with a book, let us now go into the
periodical room. Here we spend hours sifting through an im-
posing array of magazines—magazines from all the far corners
of the earth, magazines of every nature and description—but
though we search diligently and well, we cannot find Mad or

Playboy.

 

   

SHE: Whatcha readin’

“Sl binned dll ,

Next let us venture into the reference room.

Here in this
hushed, vaulted chamber, we find the true scholars of the
university —earnest, dedicated young men and women who care
for only one thing in the world: the pursuit of knowledge.

Let us eavesdrop for a moment on this erudite couple poring
over heavy tomes at the corner table. Hush! She speaks:

, hey?

HE: The Origin of Species. You ever read it?
SHE: No, but I seen the movie,

HE: Oh.

SHE: You like readin’?

HE: Naah,

SHE: What do you like?

HE: Hockey, licorice, girls, stuff like that.

SHE: Me too, hey.

HE: You pinned or anything?

SHE: Well, sort of. I’m wearin a fellow’s motorcycle

emblem...

But it’s only platonic,

HE: Wanna go out for a smoke?

SHE: Marlboro?
HE: What else?

And as our learned friends take their leave, let us too wend

our way homeward—a trifle weary,

perhaps, but enlightened

and renewed and better citizens for having spent these happy

hours in the library,

Fraternity pledges will hear a

The discussion, planned by the

Mr. Fletcher’s talk will help clear
up some of the misunderstanding
freshmen receive of what a frater-

Distinguished by a background of
varied experience, Mr. Fletcher was

Russ’ placement climaxed scoring
for both teams.

The General feeling by W&L
coaches and players indicated that
the Generals turned in a satisfactory,
but not outstanding, performance
against the Tigers. Most players said
Sewanee was not as tough as Emory
and Henry, which fell to McLaugh-
lin’s men here two Saturdays ago.

And most of the players felt
cautiously optimistic about the
two teams remaining on the sche-
dule. Neither Frederick nor Wash-
ington has been very successful
this year, but the Generals are
reluctant to judge them at face
value. As one player put it, “We
should beat them, but then you
can never tell about a football
game. We’ll have to play our best.”
W&L is expected to be at full

strength for this week’s home en-
counter. No serious injuries were
reported after the Sewanee game.

Little Interest Is Shown
In Control Committee

By STEVE SMITH
As of Thursday, only three students at Washington and Lee had applied
to serve as members of the Student Control Committee. By Friday, two
more applications had been received by EC Secretary Steve Suttle.
Suttle said that the deadline for application for a committee position will

come next week.

There is no excuse for a lack of interest or support among students
for the new committee. Failure of the student body to support the Control
Committee to the fullest would be certain to illustrate only that it is
unworthy of the trust which has been given it by the administration.

Last year the student body voted for a platform which included
as a goal the formation of just such a body. Now the faculty has
conceded the responsibility of discipline to student government, and
the students must show that they are able to accept the responsibil-

ity they have won.

In creating the Student Control Committee the faculty actually gave
more power to the student body than had been requested by the Execuive
Committee. There is no faculty member on the committee as was originally
planned by the EC. Now it is turn about.

Steve Suttle said that he expects more applications for the committee
mmbership at the last minute, “after the EC members go around to speak

to fraternities, and the people realize what has happened.” When some-!

thing of this nature occurs students must not wait to be pushed; they
must exhibit interest in the committe if it is to be a success.
As Uncas McThenia said, the committee will at times not be composed

of “the most popular guys in the world,” because its members will have |
an enforcement job. But if the responsibility is not immediately and cap-'!

ably taken up by students—responsibility is likely to escape them.

McThenia has further described the background of the committee.
He said that the plan is the result of several weeks of planning by the
faculty and Administration Committee and the EC.

Although the faculty group is of course “not an impersonal group,
yet the students will be closer” by treating discipline problems them-
selves, he said. “When we came to Washington and Lee we accepted
the Honor System. If we can mature in one area, it’s only a step

to spread into other areas.”

Another advantage of student control was seen in greater pride in the
general conduct of the student body. McThenia pointed out that respon-
sibility for conduct will bring this effect. The Student Control Committee
is not so much a punitive committee “as it is to prevent,” reminded the

President.

No set of penalties have been outlined which the committee may take,
for the reason that the group will always act with regard to circumstances.
The faculty Administrative Committee has acted in the past on the same

idea.

The EC could not have handled this job, said McThenia, without dis-
cipline becoming confused in some student’s minds with the Honor System.
To remove any confusion with Honor System and the EC or with other
affairs, an entirely new body has been created. Honor offenses will continue
to be handled by the EC, of course, as will police court convictions by the

faculty.

 

Literary Society Hears Flournoy
Discuss Stratford-on-Avon Tour

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Wednesday night Dr. Fitzgerald
Flournoy spoke to members and
guests of the Washington Literary
Society. He gave a humorous and
informative reading of a paper, orig-
inally prepared for the Advisory
Committee of the Faculty, in which
he discussed his experiences in Eu-
rope this past summer.

His elaboration on the text includ-
ed expositions of “those things that
should not be included in a formal
report.”

On June 5 Dr. Flournoy set sail
on the “Great Bear” (he has been
kidded about this) for France. His
account of the voyage drew peals of
laughter and a few guffaws from the
audience.

Floating Roommate

One of his roommates was a ballet
dance (male) whose ease in “float-
ing down from his upper deck bed”
astounded Dr. Flournoy, who ad-
mitted that he certainly did not
float from his own bed.

Paris was having a Ballet Festival,
part of which was described with
infinite delicacy by Dr. Flournoy. He
commented on the French predilic-
tion for ironic jesting and told of

 

Episcopal Church Plans
Christmas Service Dec. 14

The annual Christmas Candlelight
Service will take place in the Robert
E. Lee Episcopal Church at ten
o'clock on the evening of Thurs-
day, December 14. Ken Lane is
chairman of the UCA committee re-
sponsible for planning the service
and decorating the church.

Lane says that the usual format
for the service will be followed. Stu-
dents will read passages from the
Bible designed to tell the Christmas
story.

The scripture readings will be in-
terspersed with the singing of
hymns.

Lane hopes to get Dr. John N.
Thomas, a member of the Board of
Trustees, to deliver the Christmas
Meditation. The Washington and Lee
Glee Club will be asked to partici-
pate.

The service is non-denominational;
all students and faculty members are
invited to attend.

 

the time he astounded and won the
friendship of the young lady who
cared for his rooms.

He visited the Flea Market and
the church of the Sacred Heart for
the first time and tangentially des-
cribed the past history of both.

Rabelaisian Dinner

Dr. Flournoy visited the home
of Rabelais and there ate a “mag-
nificent meal in memory of him.” He
later described some of the wonders
of French culinary art.

One dinner with friends lasted
from 8:00 until 11:00. The first course
consisted of Pea Soup, the second of
steak, the third of a souffle with a
brandy sauce flavored with orange.

The main purpose of his European
visit was to attend a_ six-weeks
course in Shakespeare and Eliza-
bethan Drama in Shakespeare’s home
town of Stratford-on-Avon.

The students, mostly professors
and graduate school students, at-
tended seminars, wrote papers, and
attended plays and lectures.

Dr. Flournoy said that the stu-
dents were welcomed by the towns-
people and described Stratford as
an agricutural and market town, ex-
cept for the tourist trade and the
brewing industry. He passed around
postcards illustrating the wild
swans at Stratford, the home and
grave of Shakespeare, and several
French castles he visited.

Stratford Tour

The students were given a tour of
Stratford and environs, including
the park where, in the words of the
townspeople, “Willie pinched the
deer.” They visited Bath, an early
Roman swimming pool, and Stone-
henge.

In the course of his travels, Dr.
Flournoy ran into several Washing-
ton and Lee alumni and faculty
members and revisited Oxford, “that
home of lost causes,” where he visit-
ed some friends he had not seen
“since we were boys at Oxford.”

After his talk coffee and tea were
served to those who wished to stay
and it was announced that there
would be an organizational meeting
of the Washington Literary Society
this coming Tuesday at 7:30 in the
Student Union. Students interested
in membership should come to this
meeting.

and PHIL OLIVER

“We have to discover that all men are brothers—we may

True Slate
Staged Reading

The Troubadours are now
in rehearsal preparing George
Bernard Shaw’s Don Juan in
Hell for opening November
30. The play, which is essen-
tially Act III of Shaw’s Man

and Superman, will run three nights,
Thursday through Saturday, No-
vember 30-December 2, starting at
8:30 p.m.

There are only four actors in the
play. Mrs. Ruth R. Browne, PiKA
housemother, will read the part of
Dona Ana. The three male actors are
all members of the W&L faculty. Dr.
Cecil D. Jones, director of the
Troubadour Theatre, will act as Don
Juan. Dr. James K. Shillington, asse-
ciate professor of chemistry, will be
the statute, and journalism instruc-
tor John K. Jennings will do the part
of the devil.

Don Juan in Hell will be presented
in the form of a staged reading.
That is, there will be no costumes,
illusional scenery or _ character
make-up, and the actors will remain
seated. However, gestures will be
used and the reading will be like a
play in all other aspects. Since the
production is an extra addition to

_ the Troub schedule, season ticket

holders as well as the general public
are advised that admission will be
$1.00. Seat reservations can be made
by telephoning the Troubadour
Theatre after the Thanksgiving
vacation starting November 27.

Ashley Wiltshire
Is Baptist Head

Washington and Lee senior Ashley
Wiltshire was recently elected presi-
dent of the Virginia Baptist Student
Union, at the state BSU convention.

Wiltshire, a Delt pre-ministerial
student, was not present at the
convention and did not even know
of his nomination. He was out of
the state with the football team dur-
ing the weekend of the Baptist youth
meeting at Eagle Eyrie, Va. “All I
know is, I was standing in front of
the Delt house and somebody drove
by and told me I was president,” he
says.

Actually the election was not such
a surprise. In his sophomore year
Wiltshire served as vice president of
the state organization, and he spent
an entire summer working with
churches in Jamacia under Baptist
Student Union sponsorship.

Several W&L students attended
the state convention, which was
crowded with about 350 students and
coeds from Virginia colleges. In the
election, a VMI cadet was elected
vice president of the group, which
represents some 8,000 students in
this state.

Tonight at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel, |
the Washington and Lee Concert |
Guild will present Oscar MeCul-

program will include the following: |
Dichterliebe-Shumann, Benjamin
Britten’s arrangements of four Brit-
ish Folk Songs, five art songs of
Brahms and four songs of Charles |

Mr. McCullough graduated from

Bachelor of Music Degree. Then he |
went to the Eastman School of Mu- |
sic of the University of Rochester,
from which he graduated in 1952
with a Master of Music Degree and |
a Performer’s Certificate.

Mr. McCullough has _ directed |
many Choir and Choral groups, and |
Opera Workshop at the college level |
in recent years. During this time he

number of engagements as a soloist.
He has spent his summers studying
with many of today’s outstanding
musicians: Boris Goldovsky and Paul

Kilburn and Aksel Schiotz at the
Royal Conservatory of Music of
Toronto, Leonard Treash at Oglebay
Opera Institute, Paul Schilhawsky,
Dr. Robert Wagner and Alexander
Paulmuller at the International
Summer Academy at the Mozarteum
in Salzburg. Presently he is teach-
ing at Hollins College.

Mr. McCullough has performed 18
operas and 15 oratorios with var-
ious orchestras in Virginia, West
Virginia, North Carolina, New York
and Ohio as well as Canada, Austria,
and Germany.

kof the ethical problems implied in

in it. The next evening he again
spoke in Lee Chapel.

Boulding suggested that Christian-
ity is probably the only bridge over
the gaps between peoples today.
Fighting, he said, is no longer
reasonable.

He explored the problems inherent
in both capitalistic and socialistic
ways of life. The most important
ethical problem of an affluent so-
ciety such as ours, he said, is
how to learn: how to be able to
start. “The poor know how to start,
but people of an affluent society
have had little experience of spiri-
tual benefit.”

There is a great deal of mock
heroics in the United States, Bould-
ing said, and not enough real hero-
ism. He stated that a market-orien-
tated society is vulgar, and that
there is nothing heroic about capital-
ism’s shopkeepers. But he noticed a
real heroism in the racial movement
of the Negro race. He described the
integration effort as a type of hero-
ism of a Christian origin.

A great problem to our civiliza-
tion, according to Boulding is the
difficulty of the rich to be moral at
all. Since the United States is the
richest nation in the world, it would
not seem strange that we also have
such a striking crime rate and are
faced with a slow decay at the
heart of our principles.

Perhaps the greatest shocker of
Boulding’s statements was that “the
proletariat is almost disappearing.”
“For all practical purposes the pro-
letariat will disappear in the U‘S. in
25 years,” and it is already disap-
pearing in Soviet Russia, he said.

Boulding suggested that the reason
for the inferiority of socialism to
capitalism is that the government
is responsible for the people “The
arrogance that I can be responsible
for you,” he explained, “does not
inspire you to do good or to be re-
sponsible.”

Another problem of the USSR is
that its socialism is not pure, said
Boulding. He cited dictatorship as
a poor stimulus to a people’s quali-
ties.

Boulding made it clear, however,
that socialism is a powerful economic
threat to America and to capitalism.

“Man is faced with the most awful
choice in history,” said the econo-
mist. “He can’t stay where he is. He
must go on into a world of stable
peace or fall backwards...”

Boulding is a well-known econo-
mist who is presently serving as pro-
fessor of economics at the University
of Michigan.

Pledges Hear
Sigma Nu

Richard Fletcher, chief executive
of Sigma Nu fraternity, told Wash-
ington and Lee fraternity pledges
last night that “A pledge has a right
to be treated as a man seeking an
education.”

Fletcher hit hazing as “a practice
we associate with kids.” He warned
that the housekeeping, goals, and
“production of educational dimen-
sion” were somewhat lacking in
Washington and Lee fraternities.
Fletcher is close to fraternity life
in Lexington at the Sigma Nu na-
tional headquarters.

He painted a picture which he
hoped the pledges will be able to see
in their own chapters after they are
initiated. Fraternities, he said, have
“the greatest potential in the world.”
But he voiced the opinion that fra-
ternities have yet to fulfill the po-
tential greatly. He outlined the fra-
ternal mission as combining “family,
church, and education in brother-
hood, ritual, and study.

Fraternity men, said Fletcher, are
still an “over-privileged” group—
the elite, although this is not ap-
parently the case in Lexington. An
extremely small percentage of col-
lege men are members of fraterni-
ties.

Fletcher is a former director of
athletics at the University of Vir-
ginia and journalism teacher,

A Protest Of Our Own

The editors of Protest made some very good suggestions
last week. We have been well-pleased this year with their sense
of responsibility and have noticed the improvement in that
publication’s prose. It’s a far cry from the “hate” columns we
were subjected to last year.

However, we think it should be emphasized that the op-
portunities exist for OLB, Dutchie, and the rest to take part
in the student government here if they will only come down
off their respective hobby horses and offer to do a little work.
Anyone can write Letters to the Editor.

 

Have any of these people who want constitutional reforms
submitted their proposals to Steve Suttle for the Executive
Committee study? Or, if they dislike going through the EC,
have they sought by circulating a petition to have these pro-
posals brought before the student body for a vote? They have
not.

Have any of them offered to serve on the Assimilation
Committee, with whose work they are dissatisfied? We wager
they have not.

Have any of them offered their expert services in mass
communications to the Ring-tum-Phi? We haven’t seen them.

How many of them have applied to serve on the Dance
Board Advisory Council? How many of them will apply to
serve on the new Student Disciplinary Committee?

How many of them have contributed sound and construc-
tive thought on the Honor System to the pages of Protest,
or the Ring-tum Phi; or to discussions in the EC and elsewhere?

How many of them have ever done anything on this cam-
pus but gripe?

We're disgusted with this guerilla action that Protest is
directing against a group of men who have given a great deal
of their time and their thought to student government at Wash-
ington and Lee.

There are many ways in which student affairs here can be
improved. Every organization on campus needs improvement
in one way or another.

We challenge these malcontents to stop screaming at the
people who are doing the work on campus and we’d be de-
lighted to show them how they can help share the load of work
which overwhelms every student leader at present. It’s time for
Protest to put up or shut up.

A Sense Of Pride

Tomorrow will mark the last appearance on Wilson Field
for a group of men who have given a great deal to Washington
and Lee. They, of course, are the seniors on this year’s football
team. They have lifted W&L football from a time when we had
to apologize for it to the present, when every member of the
W&L community can walk tall on fall Saturdays.

Football, like any sport, demands sacrifices. Time spent on
the practice field could have been spent studying, or dating, or
sleeping, or getting to be a Big Man on Campus. Training rules
separate a man from much of the social life here three months
of the year. The W&L football team makes plenty of sacri-
fices. Every member of the team would tell you, if asked, that
he played football just because he enjoyed it. That, as anyone
who has ever known the rough physical contact on the grid-
iron knows, is reason enough for the sacrifices.

Something more than ‘‘fun”’ however, has driven the team
to their present heights. A fierce pride in Washington and Lee
has done the job. The men on the team have not forgotten
the ridicule heaped on us when we were down. For four years
the senior footballers have been determined to erase the shame
of those autumns from 1955 through 1958. They were deter-
mined to prove to all the world that there were still men at
W&L. They have.

Courtney Mauzy and Bob Funkhouser of last year’s team
and every senior on the team this year deserve a special vote
of thanks from Washington and Lee, even if they would be
a little embarrassed to receive it.

Let’s Cross-Pollinate!

Dr. Kenneth Boulding’s appearance here this week, spon-
sored jointly by the departments of religion and economics,
is part of an encouraging trend at Washington and Lee toward
closer cooperation between the various departments of study.

We are firm believers in the principle of a departmental
major, on the grounds that a man is not really educated unless
he has become thoroughly acquainted with one discipline. But
we do feel that academic work here tends to adhere too closely
to departmental limits. This leads to an unfortunate overcom-
partmentalization. Or, to put it simply, this week’s sessions
affirmed that you can’t study economics without taking an in-
terst in religion, and vice versa. The thorough study of a single
discipline tends always to lead one into other disciplines.

We'd like to see more of this interdepartmental coopera-
tion in the day-to-day work here. If religion has something to
contribute to economics, why shouldn’t our own Professors
Hodges and Sprunt present “guest lectures” in the commerce
school? The department of psychology can contribute a great
deal to the study of literature. The natural sciences are woe-
fully disregarded by liberal arts majors.

Here’s for more cross-pollination.

 

An Interview With Dr. Hughes

 

The German Reunification Problem

By TRACY HARRINGTON

As Berlin continues to balance
precariously in its half-communist,
half-free political schizophrenia, the
possibilities for any chance of Ger-
man unification lessen. The Western
and Communist worlds seem to stand
on clearly defined policies—neither
showing any sign of “giving in” in
order to fuse the two Germanys.
Russia won’t permit free elections
in East Germany, and the U.S. re-
fuses to abandon its military po-
sition in West Germany.

Communist propaganda overflows
with warnings of the “re-creation of

German militarism,” and all-to-vivid| |

photographs of World War II atroci-
ties are sprinkled liberally through
articles decrying armament in West
Germany.

According to Dr. Thomas P.
Hughes, associate professor of his-
tory, the obvious effort of the com-
munists to create an image of Ger-
many as she was under the Nazi
regime may really be sincere.

“I think that the Russians are
genuinely afraid of the Germans. We
must remember that the Russians
have been invaded twice in this
century by the Germans,” he said.

He pointed out that although the
Germans have behaved arrogantly
since 1933, for 100 years before that
they were “some of the most creative
and disciplined people of Europe.”

He said it is not fair for us “to
balance 15 years against 100.”

Bowl Coach

happened recently upon this ex-
change of letters between Quiz Bowl
Coach Frank Parsons and alumnus
Phil Grose. Parsons’ answer appears
on page four.)

Coach Frank Parsons
Washington and Lee University
Lexington, Va .

Dear Coach Parsons,

As an irate alumnus who just
viewed our dear alma mater’s na-
tional disgrace, I feel compelled to
write and suggest that either you
be fired from your job as college
bowl coach, or that we step up our
scholarship program so that we can
compete with our natural rivals
such as Pomona on an even basis. In
short, I think that amateur studies
are not producing the type of col-
lege bowl teams which we as alumni
think are representative of the
school. I believe what we need, coach
Parsons, is a system of scouts
throughout the country who could
report to the University on out-
standing scholastic prospects for the
team. Then we could go through a
period of recruiting these special
students, luring them with such
things as new cars and jobs for their
families and friends. It might also
be advisible to hold out certain out-
standing college bowl prospects for
a year, sort of “red-booking” them
so they can learn and study and not
lose a year of eligibility.

Coach Parsons, I know that there
are those who will be wrong-think-
ers and say such things as “Studies
for Students, Not Students for
Studies,” and claim that students
can have fun and learn at the same
time, but we as alumni, do not think
such a plan is feasible if we are to
keep up with our natural rivals.
Now I know this high school senior
down here with a great pair of eyes,
reads fast, has a great IQ, can move
quickly from book to book without
losing his balance, and has some
tremendous moves with a_ pencil.
Also he’ll show up real well before
the cameras. (Coach Parsons, some
of those fellows we had on TV to-
day...)

Well, coach, you know you can
count on me to support the old Uni-
versity come what may. I’m loyal,
but many more losses like today’s
and I'll switch my allegiance to a
more powerful school like Haver-
ford or Oberlin.

universities of the 19th century were
the best in the world. Students had
more freedom of movement because
discipline was not necessary—the
motivation to work was already in
them.

“Certainly we must think of the
concentration camps of World War

 

 

| Il. But can we forget the German

universities of the past century?”

Dr. Hughes believes that Germany
will—and must—be reunited. “It will
come,” he said, “either as a result
of war or negotiations, but it will
come.”

Does he believe that we need fear
“German militarism?”

“Possibly, the humiliation which

‘| the Germans have suffered in two
|| defeats in the century would make

them again want to be military.
Perhaps they are not ready for uni-

| fication, but we must help them find

themselves.”
According to Dr. Hughes, the hu-
miliation of the Germans following

_| World War I and in the subsequent

depression probably made them
susceptible to Hitler’s frenzied ide-
ology. “They had been a great peo-
ple, and they wanted to be again.
Hitler simply offered them a means.”

Here in the United States, we
seem to be concerned over whether
the German question of re-unifica-
tion will bring about a global war.
Dr. Hughes said that we would not
go to war to unify Germany, “but
the tense German situation could re-
sult in a set of circumstances that
would bring about war.

“What we have in Germany now
is simply a manifestation of the basic
distrust between the United States
and the U.S.S.R.”

What about the rest of the free
world, especially those European
countries which suffered from Ger-
man agression in World War II? How
do they feel about unification?

 

“Both Britain and France are pub-
licly on the record for reunification.
In England, German troops trained
in German uniforms with little hos-
tile demonstration. I think Europeans
are really for unification.

“Immediately after the war they
probably would not have felt as they
do now, but there is little ill feeling
remaining between the Germans and
other Europeans,” he said.

Again and again Dr. Hughes em-
phasized that it is neither to our in-
terest nor to the interest of the
Russians to keep Germany divided.
“It is an unnatural thing for the
Germans to be so divided, and West
Germany may take advantage of
enmity between the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. to pursue its own end, if
we allow this unnatural situation to
prevail.”

If Germany, then, must reunify,
the question is how?

“Ultimately, we must decide to
deal with West Germany as an in-
dependent nation. We must realize
that we can no longer decide Ger-
man policy.

“Also, Russia must make conces-
sions. Both sides must quit using
Germany, and give her an opportu-
nity to contribute as a_ unified
whole.”

Russia is not going to allow free
elections, and we are not going to
withdraw our troops. If concessions
are in order, they don’t seem to be
possible presently. But, as Dr.
Hughes has said, “Germany will be
united—either as a result of nego-
tiations or war.”

Thanksgiving In New York, Mildew Style

By STEVE HENRY
November 30
Dear Bobby,

I sure wish I could have made it
home for Thanksgiving this year,
but it is a long way from good
old Washington and Lee to Arkan-
sas. I missed seeing you and all
the folks down there, but I guess
I'll survive until Christmas.

Anyway, I just wanted to write
and tell you about New York, where
we all went during the Thanks-
giving holidays. All the cool guys
here go up to New York every
year—it’s the only really cool thing
to do. Don’t get me wrong. I’d rath-
er be able to go home, but you
know how it is.

New York is something else, let
me tell you. It’s just like in the
movies, just exactly like in the
movies, except during Thanksgiv-
ing there are about a million kids
up there, from all the cool schools
like us and Harvard and all those,
you know. I wish you could get a
chance to go up during the holidays.
Tll guarantee you, you would never
forget it.

But, anyway, I went up with a
bunch of guys on the train. We
got on the train in Washington, and,
no kidding, it was like a refugee
train in one of those movies about
India, you know what I mean. There
were people standing up on the
seats and in the aisles and every-
where, and when I got a seat finally,
I wasn’t about to give it up to any
old lady or anybody, let me tell
you.

You might think it’s crazy for us
to go up on the train when it’s all
that crowded, but we had a reason,
believe me. All kinds of girls go up
on the trains—girls from all over
everywhere, and it’s really easy to
find a good girl to date up there in
the city while you’re on the train.

For instance, 1 met this really
cute girl on the train from Hollins
(that’s a girl’s school, by the way),
and we sat together on the way up.
We really got along great, and talk-
ed about all kinds of things, and I
said to myself, “Mildew, old boy,
you have really scored this time.
This is a good baby and she’s hot
for you.” But the funniest thing
happened when we got to this little
town outside New York. I think it
was something like Princeton, New
Jersey (or is it Princeton, New
York?), Anyway, this guy got on the
train, and he had on khaki pants
and a dirty raincoat and the girl
practically crawled all over me get-
ting to the aisle so she could crawl
all over him, right in front of every-
body in the whole car, too. I finally

figured out that they had been go-
ing together and had planned to
meet there, because I know good and
well that she would never dump on
a Washington and Lee man for some
cruddy guy with khakis and a dirty
raincoat. Me with my Thomas, Ltd.
(that’s a clothing store at school)
yellow shirt on and all.

Man, I knew I wasn’t a problem.
I just wish I could have had a few
more minutes with her, and I don’t
even think she would have gone
back to that guy ever. I think I’ll
call her up sometime, but that’s
something else.

Anyway, to make a long story
short, after that happened, I didn’t
meet any other girls on the train,
so we just stood up between cars
and drank, and by the time we got
to the city we were really in the
bag (drunk, you know), and barely
could make it to the hotel where
we were staying, which was the Bilt-
more and is a big college kid hang-
out.

You wouldn’t believe it, there were
so many kids standing around. Girls
and boys, laughing and yelling and
some even singing. We just had
walked in the door, and guess who
I saw. Billy Osborne, of all people.
Can you imagine running into an-
other guy from home in New York?
Well, I talked with Billy and he said
he really liked things at Dartmouth,
and that I ought to come up the next
day for a drink.

The next day I got up pretty early
and decided to go sight-seeing like
mother wrote that she wanted me to
do, but first I decided to go up to
Billy’s room in the Roosevelt (an-
other hotel) and see what was going
on. We went over to the Roosevelt,
and there were a million kids stand
ing around, and I even got a date
right out of the lobby. (She was from
Hartford, Connecticut, and went to
Smith, by the way. Don’t ask me
where Smith is. I don’t know. It’s
a girls school or something I think.)

Anyway, we went up to Billy’s
and there were all kinds of people
up there drinking. We started get-
ting a party going, and before we
knew it, it was noon and time for
Thanksgiving dinner, and we went
down to a Howard Johnson’s and
ate a hamburger, and then came
back up to the apartment and stay-
ed until dark when it was time to
go out in the city.

We were walking out of the hotel,
and my date says to me, “Mildew, I
know it’s so expensive up here,
and daddy gave me some money and
I want to go Dutch, if it’s all right
with you.” Now you know darn
well it was fine with me, and we

went to this place called the African
Room which was really neat, but
quite expensive. In fact, I got a
check for twenty-three dollars, and
I sat there waiting for this girl to
come up with eleven-fifty, but she
just sat there, too, and I ended up
paying the whole thing, which more
or less hacked me off. I ended up
spending nearly fifty bucks that
night, if you can believe it. You

News Item

CHICAGO (UPI)—The coroner
asked permission recently to hire
a second attendant for the midnight-
to-8 a.m. shift at the county morgue
because the present attendant “is
afraid to stay alone in the morgue
with the bodies.”

Corner Andrew J. Towman told
the Cook County board that the lone
attendant now sometimes puts the
receiving office telephone outside the
window and stays out in the cold
awaiting any calls.

“You mean you want someone to
hold his hands so he won't get
scared?” asked C. R. Hodgeman,
the budget director.

“That's partly it,’ Mr. Toman re-
plied. “He must help put bodies
away, too.”

The corner said that none of the
three daytime attendants wanted the
job.

“They are just as scared,”
said.

Beta Wins Tennis

PiK A’s And Chi’s
Get I-M Victories

By HOWIE KORMAN

With first place decided in all
four football divisions, the playoffs
between the champions began on
November 14. In the opening round
of the double elimination tourna-
ment, Sigma Chi out scored Phi
Kap 7-0 to keep its record unblem-
ished. In the second game the grid-
ders from PiKA rallied in the second
half to defeat the Betas, 6-0.

The I-M Bowling program at
the Lexington Alleys, Sigma Nu,
PiKA and the Delts opened their
seasons with wins on November 14.

After losing the first game, the
rollers from Sigma Nu combined
for a 2151 total to down Phi Ep.
High man for the winners was
Thorns Craven, while Bob Wiess-
man of the PEP’s had games of
178, 131, and 201.

In the PiKA-DU encounter, the
winners showed strength in this
sport by having all their players
bowl at least 400 for three games.
PiKA Dick Spencer had the high
game of the evening with a 211
finish.

Later in the same day the Delts
overpowered Pi Phi.

Baby Generals
End Season

Against SMA

After six straight losses most foot-
ball teams would be glad to forget
the whole thing. But not Washington
and Lee’s freshman football team.

The Baby Generials, who have
fought six losing battles, are still
as eager to play football as the
varsity W&L squad that is rolling
along with a lengthy victory string.

One of the best examples of the
Baby Generals’ desire to play came
in their 50-0 loss to Chowan Jr.
College several weeks ago. Late in
the game W&L got the ball at mid-
field, but wasn’t content to just
run out the clock. The Baby Gener-
als took two straight time outs
in order to get in two more plays.

Staunton

The Baby Generals’ desire will get
another test this afternoon in their
third straight game against the
cream of the Virginia Military
League. This week’s opponent is
Staunton Military Academy, the
league’s number one club and one
of the best prep teams in Virginia.

The game scheduled for 3:15 on
W&L’s Wilson Field, will be a benefit
for the Lexington High School band.
Even the home team will pay to
get into the stadium.

In analyzing Staunton, freshman
coach Dana Swan points out that
offensively it concentrates on po-
tent end sweeps and the belly series,
and defensively it uses a 5-4 or
Oklahoma type formation.

Generals Meet Frederick College
Tomorrow In Last Home Game

Washington and Lee’s undefeated football Generals make
their last 1961 home stand tomorrow at 2 p.m. when they meet
Frederick College on Wilson Field.

The Generals are the Lions’ only state opponent, and
head coach Lee MClaughlin points out that a Frederick victory
would permit the Lions to claim state small college supremacy.

Frederick enters tomorrow’s con-* =

test with an even 3-3 season’s
record. W&L is 7-0 for the year.

“There’s no doubt about it, they'll
come up here with blood in their
eyes,” says McLaughlin. “Frederick
has beaten some pretty good foot-
ball teams, lost by close margins
to some other good ones, and we
know we'll have a tougher game
than some people expect on the
basis of comparative records.”

Similar to E-H

Freshman Coach Dana Swan, who
has scouted Frederick, says the
Lions are very similar to Emory
and Henry in the style of football
they offer.

“They've got all the equipment
needed to play good football,” re-
ported Swan. “They have size and
speed and desire. They'll be tough.”

Swan was particularly impressed
by halfback Bobby Gray. “As fast
as greased lightning,” said Swan,
noting that the Generals may see
unusually heavy assaults on their
flanks this Saturday.

In an effort to match the Gener-|

als’ three-unit depth, Swan said
Frederick Coach Bill McDonald used
an effective second unit as such in

the Lions’ 8-7 loss to Maryville Sat-|

urday.

 

| ton scoreless last year, winning 28-0.

 

Swan says a single defensive mis-
take cost the Lions the game against
Maryville. Other Lion defeats were
Newport News Apprentice School
and very tough Newberry, by a
respectable 23-0 score. On the credit
side, Frederick has bumped West
Virginia Tech, Grove City and Edin-
boro State Teachers, the latter two
rugged small Pennsylvania colleges.

Injuries

McLaughlin is concerned about
the physical pounding the Generals
have absorbed of late, starting with
the Emory and Henry game. The
personnel situation is most acute at
right guard and left tackle where
two of the first three men at each
spot are sidelined.

“Some of our injuries are not
the really crippling kind, but they’re
the kind that reduce our effective-
ness,” McLaughlin points out. He
says that senior guard Tommy
Goodwin’s response to treatment of
a leg injury has him worried.
Goodwin, says McLaughlin, is “our
‘class’ lineman.”

The Generals wind up the 1961
season with a Thanksgiving Day
game at Washington University in
St. Louis, Mo. W&L held Washing-

 

 

Frederick Is
New Opponent

Frederick College, W&L’s oppon-
ent tomorrow, is a four-year college
for the first time this year.

Located in Portsmouth, Virginia,
Frederick switched over to the
four-year plan this term after a
long history as a junior college.

Like Washington and Lee, Fred-
erick does not go out of its way to
field a football power, but still man-
ages to field a better than average
small college team.

This year’s Lion editon has posted
a 3-3 record against small college
competition.

* * *

A victory Saturday will hike Lee
McLaughlin’s college coaching rec-
ord above the .500 mark. He’s now
19-19-2 after nearly five years.

ae * *

The Generals now have scored
234 points, an average of 33.4 a
game, while allowing their oppon-
ents only 26 points. The points-per-
game average is good enough to
rank Washington and Lee in the top
ten NCAA small colleges, offensively,
while the stinginess of the defense is
believed to be second nationally
among both NCAA and NIAA small-
college teams.

I made up my mind when I woke
up at noon the next day that I was
going to do something worthwhile
(I was feeling pretty bad about the
night before), so I went downstairs,
and Billy said he was going to
a cocktail party at another hotel,

worth it at all. Don’t tell anybody
at home about this, you hear.

Saturday was about the same
way, except we threw a party in
our room, which was really the
only way we could pay back all the
guys we had bummed off the other
two days. I hate to admit it, but I
passed out sometime in the after-
noon, and didn’t wake up _ until
almost ten that night. I had made
a date already, but when I went
to get her it was too late, and she
was gone. I tried to get another
date, but no dice. I went back to
the hotel and watched television.
New York has _ seven television

Coach Parsons’ Answer

Dear Alumnus Grose:

It is apparent there is no middle
ground which will serve the best
interest of alumni and the univer-
sity.

In view of this, we have decided
to give up studies altogether and
concentrate on athletics. It is con-
ceivable that at some time in the
future we may wish to engage in
a limited program, such as intramur-
mural parallel reading. In the mean-
while, I hope you and other alumni
wil ltake justified pride in Wash-
ington and Lee as an athletic fac-
tory.

Debaters Win Regionals

By JULIAN MARKHAM
News Editor
The Washington and Lee debate team triumphed over the
top debating powers in the state last weekend to win the Vir-
ginia Debate Championship for the second consecutive year.
The Championship was held in connection with the Tau Kappa

 

Alpha Tournament staged at Bridgewater College.

Debating the question, “Resolved:*
That labor organizations should come
under the jurisdictions of anti-trust
legislation,” the team posted a 7-1
record in the competition. Washing-
ton and Lee was represented on the
negative side by Al Eckes and Bill
Noell. This team compiled a 4-0
competitive record. Debating the
affirmative were Bill Boardman and
Jay Clark who posted a 3-1 record
for the tournament.

As a tribute to their oratorical
abilities, Al Eckes and Bill Noell
tied for second place overall in the
tournament, while alternate Richard
McEnally was awarded third place
overall, negative division. Similar-
ly, achieving distinction for their
outstanding performances were Bill
Boardman and Jay Clark who placed
third and fourth respectively overall
in the affirmative division. Debate
Coach William Chaffin noted that
this the first time in regional history
everyone on a particular school team
had won recognition for individual
speaking merit. The W&L team
took five of eight awards.

The Washington and Lee alternate
team included Charles McCord, John
Lackey, Gay Reading, and Richard
McEnally.

The debate team completed their
tournament victory after a sharp
political battle on the convention
floor, by securing the 1962 Tau Kap-
pa Alpha Regional Debate Tourna-
ment on the Washington and Lee
campus, Also, team captain Bill
Boardman was elected president of
the Virginia Regional of Tau Kappa
Alpha.

Reflecting upon W&L’s tremen-
dous success at Bridgewater, Mr.
Chaffin said, “Of course, I am de-
lighted with the results of the tour-
nament. However, our primary ob-
ject in intercollegiate debate is not
just the winning of tournaments, but
to expose as many interested stu-
dents as possible to collegiate debate
and discussion. It is an educational
process.”

Future plans of the debate team
include tournaments at New York
University and Duke University later
in the winter.

 

Placement
Interview

On Wednesday, November 29, Mr.
Almand Coleman of the University
of Virginia Graduate School of Busi-
ness Administration will be on the
campus to talk with seniors interest-
ed in the Graduate School of Busi-
ness. Mr. Coleman will discuss the
program leading to the Master’s de-
gree of Business Administration, a
two-year course of training for ad-
ministrative responsibilities.

The program is open without
course or concentration prerequisites
to qualified college graduates. All
interested seniors are urged to make
appointments at the Placement Of-
fice to meet with Mr. Coleman.

 

 

Cole Announces

Faculty-Passed
King Resolution

The contents of a faculty resolu-
tion dealing with a proposed invi-
tation to Dr. Martin Luther King
to take part in a Washington and
Lee University student religious
seminar were announced today.

The resolution, passed by a major-
ity vote of the faculty at a regularly-
scheduled meeting on November 6,
was forwarded to the Board of Trus-
tees by President Fred C. Cole at
the request of the faculty. The facul-
ty asked President Cole to announce
publicly the resolution’s contents
only after the Board has had oppor-
tunity to receive the resolution
through normal channels.

The resolution stated:

“The faculty of Washington and
Lee University expressed its gen-
uine regret at the decision of the
Board of Trustees that prevents
the Christian Asociation from ex-
tending to Dr. Martin Luther King
an invitation to speak at the uni-
versity. This decision, in the opin-
ion of the faculty, seriously limits
the freedom of inquiry that should
prevail in an institution of higher
learning, and denies to students
the opportunity to learn and judge
for themselves, even upon issues
of controversy.”

James R. Caskie of Lynchburg,
rector of the board, acknowledged
receipt of the faculty resolution and
emphasized the faculty’s preroga-
tive to disagree with action by the
Board of Trustees.

“In every instance, the Board of
Trustees endeavors to act in what
it considers the best interests of
Washington and Lee University,”
Caskie declared. “In this case, there
exists an honest difference of opin-
ion as to what course of action best
serves the interest of the Univer-
sity.”

The rector praised the faculty’s
concern for “freedom of inquiry” on
the Washington and Lee campus.

“It is good that such a differ-
ence of opinion can take place in
an atmosphere of mutual respect,”
Caskie said. “It is wholesome that
the avenues of communication be-
tween the faculty and the board
remain free and open.”

The issue stemmed from a request
by the student University Christian
Association for permission to invite
the widely-known Negro integra-
tionist to take part in one of a
series of seminars in religion aimed
at relating Christianity to major
current issues. A faculty Committee
on Christian Work approved the pro-
posed invitation but referred the
matter to the Board of Trustees for
its approval. The Board declined to
approve the proposed invitation.

EMPHASIS

W&L Produces Great Unsubsidized Teams

By JOHN ALLGOOD

As W&L’s football team rolls along with an 18-game string without
a loss, one stops to wonder: How ean a school without subsidized athletics
like Washington and Lee produce such a fine team?

Or for that matter: How can a school without subsidized athletics
produce an overall record in 12 intercollegiate sports of 73 wins and
47 losses and 1 tie (a percentage of .608) like W&L’s teams compiled
in 1960-61?

Of course, the obvious answer is that W&L has good athletes.
But this wasn’t always the case here. One needs to look back only
five or six years to find a group of athletes at W&L who thought
keeping in condition was just a joke.

 

 

=

BERR

The success of the Washington and Lee athletic program can be main-
ly attributed to the program itself and the philosophy behind it.

All sports are treated equal at W&L. Minor sports such as wrestling,
swimming, and lacrosse aren’t shut up in a closet while the school
concentrates on producing winning football, basketball, and baseball
teams. All sports share alike here. There is no favoritism.

A second point is that Washington and Lee’s athletic program is
for the benefit of the students not for the benefit of the public. (Al-
though the public certainly has been enjoying the 5-Star Generals’
football win skein.)

“We're not here to put on a show,” said athletic director E. P.
“Cy” Twombly. “We're here to give our students a healthful form of
recreation.”

W&L students are encouraged to come out for sports just “for the
fun” of participating. They don’t have to play a sport to get through
school. The sports program is there for their benefit. A fine example
of playing sports “for fun” was the freshman football team.

Despite a 0-6 season the freshman gave Staunton Military Academy,
the Military League’s best team, a scare by holding it to a 7-0 halftime
lead. SMA went on to win, 28-0, but the freshmen battled fiercely all
the way.

On this freshman squad were four boys who had never played foot-
ball before. This in itself is quite a tribute to any school’s athletic pro-
gram when boys come out for varsity sports for the first time in college.

Mental attitude is another important contributing factor to the suc-
cess of Washington and Lee’s athletic program.

Take that group of athletes of five or six years ago who thought
keeping in shape was just a joke. They really didn’t care whether the
teams won or lost. They just took a whirl at playing and if they
didn’t like it, they quit. Very rarely did anyone outside the sopho-
more or freshman classes participate in intercollegiate sports.

In 1957 the worm turned. In came a new group of athletes and in
came a new football coach, Lee McLaughlin.

Eighteen of the freshmen who played football on the one-win 1958
team under McLaughlin are playing on his undefeated team today.
And a better attitude could not be found anywhere in the country.
These boys want to win, sure, but they also play for the mere enjoy-
ment of playing. They believe in the W&L program and themselves,
consequently, they are winning—winning like mad.

This exuberant spirit has overflown into the student body. Again

citing five or six years ago, Wilson Field looked like a tomb on Sat-
urday afternoon when the Generals had a home football game. Now the
stands are filled with anywhere from 2,500 to 6,000 spectators.

Still one wonders: Where does a non-subsidized school get its ath-
letes?

This is one of the strong points of the new program—the university
does not have to compromise its academic standards to obtain good
athletes.

True, W&L does not get the cream of the crop of athletes who are
picked off by the big colleges with plenty of money, but the athletes
it does get give it just as good a program as any other college.

Athletic success boils down to a few basic ingredients: good mental
attitude, a desire to play, enthusiasm, and a sprinkling of ability. Wash-

ington and Lee has all these ingredents, and it has a very successful
athletic program,

|For Control Group

 

 

|

Applications Rise

Steve Suttle, Secretary of the EC,
announced today that he was en-
couraged by the increase in appli-
cations for the Student Control
Committee. Before this time, con-
cern was expressed for the lack of
student interest in the group.

The Student Control Committee,
created by the Faculty two weeks
ago, will investigate and take ap-
propriate action on conduct offenses.
Suttle stated that he was particular-
ly impressed with the qualifications
of the applicants and that selection
will be difficult. The committee will
consist of two seniors, one junior,
and one sophomore with a represen-
tative from the Law School.

Applications for membership on
the committee must be submitted to
Steve Suttle at the Delt House no
later than Wednesday. They should
contain the student’s qualifications
and reasons for wanting to serve
with the group.

The group will be a large step
forward in the area of student self-
government. It will place the re-
sponsibility for good conduct on
more of a student to student basis.
However, this group will largely
determine the feasibility of more
self-discipline and self-government
by the students.

The Student Control Committee
is on a trial basis and is subject to
review at any time by the Adminis-
trative Committee of the Faculty.

No set penalties have been out-
lined by the group, and the commit-
tee will always act with regard to
circumstances. This is similar to the
procedure followed by the Faculty
Administrative Committee.

 

 

 

Group To Voice
Student Opinion

By STEVE GUILD

Executive News Editor

Dance-Board Vice-President
Frank Young announced to-
day the new members of the
recently-formed Dance Board
Advisory Council.

The group, composed of
twenty-five members, was chos-
en from a field of fifty appli-

cants.

The Advisory Council will
serve as a means of relating the

actions of the Dance Board
to the students. In carrying out this
objective the members will recom-
mend bands and entertainers in
popular demand by the student
body, will assist in the sale of Fancy
Dress costumes and aid the Dance
Set vice-presidents in the decorating
of the gymnasium.

In short, the committee will be
the link between the student body
and the Dance Board and faculty.

The new members of the commit-
tee are as follows:

Pete Alford, Phi Psi sophomore;
A. J. Barranco, SAE sophomore;
Joe Bear, Phi Delt freshman; Dave
Bevans, PiKA junior; Bill Board-
man,, Beta junior; Al Byrne, SAE
freshman; Don Campbell, SAE jun-
ior; Jay Clark, Phi Gam sophomore;
Tom Edwards; Phi Delt junior; John
Furness, Independent sophomore;
Barry Greene, ZBT sophomore; Ken
Greer, KA sophomore; Steve Guild,
Kappa Sig junior; Bob Hart, SAE
junior; Andy Hyde, KA sophomore;
Carroll Klingelhofer, Delt freshman;
Andy Nea, Phi Gam junior; Tom
Rains, KA junior; Tony Schlesinger,
ZBT junior; James Slay, Delt fresh-
man; Mike Spalding, Phi Delt sen-
ior; Barry Stanier, Phi Psi sophmore;
Jim Stott, DU junior; Mike Suss-
man, ZBT junior; Jim Wallenstein,
ZBT sophomore.

Young, as Vice-President of the
Dance Board, will serve as president

| of the Advisory Council. Members of

the group will remain on the Coun-
cil until their graduation from W&L.
This means that freshmen that are
selected will serve for four years.
In addition, it is expected that the
Vice-President of the Dance Board
will be chosen from those on the
Council and that membership in the
group will be a prerequisite for
that office.

“The Dance’ Board,” stated
Young, “believes that the mem-
bers of the Council are a good
representation of the student body
and will provide a cross-section of
student opinion. We hope that this
committee can serve in full capaci-
ty to relate the desires of the stu-
dent body to the Dance Board.
The Board was very pleased with

Lack Of Interest Discouraging

The apparent lack of interest that has been shown by Wash-
ington and Lee’s Student Body in the efforts of the Executive
Committee to form a Student Control Committee is indeed a
discouraging fact.

Equally discouraging is the fact that as of yesterday not
a single proposal had been submitted to the Reform Committee
for study of possible Constitutional revision.

 

The members of the Executive Committee have worked |
|

long and hard in getting the Administration to approve the |
Student Control Committee.

The faculty expressed a definite trust in the students
of Washington and Lee when they gave their approval
of this measure. Does it not seem to be a discouraging
fact that the students can’t live up to that trust?

Washington and Lee students yell and scream for Constitu- |
tional Revision. How many students have even bothered to|
read the present Constitution? We believe that not many stu- |
dents have taken the time to do so, and that the pitiful thing is.
that many of them won’t take the time to read the Constitution, |
much less submit proposals for revision. (The fact that not a
single proposal for revision has been submitted testifies to this
statement. )

Are the students of Washington and Lee so disinterested in
their government that they resist all efforts that are made to
give them more voice in disciplinary affairs? We would like to
hope that the above is not true, but from the amount of support
that has been given the E.C. it appears that W&L does indeed
have a disinterested student body.

Steve Suttle, secretary of the Student Body, told the Ring-
tum Phi yesterday that the proposals for Constitutional revi-
sion and applicaions for the Student Control Committee should
be submitted to him by tomorrow.

We hope that the students of W&L do not betray the trust
shown by the faculty’s approval of the Control Committee;
we hope that those students who wish Constitutional revision
will get busy and submit their proposals.

Without this basic support from the Student Body, The
Executive Committee cannot hope to accomplish any positive
goals.

We therefore issue this statement to the students of W&L:

Washington and Lee students, get on the ball. Support the
Executive Committee in their efforts. Apply for and support
the Student Control Committee—it’s to your best interests.
Students, it’s time for each and every one of you to put up or
shut up.

Fletcher’s Talk

“A pledge has a right to be treated as a man seeking an
education,” Mr. Richard Fletcher, chief executive of the Sigma
Nu Fraternity, said in a speech to W&L fraternity pledges last
Thursday.

Mr. Fletcher, we feel, has issued a clear-cut warning to the
18 fraternities here, and we hope that both the IFC and frater-
nity men heed his suggestion.

With Help Week just around the corner, the IFC Help
Week Committee would do well to remember Mr. Fletcher’s
words.

We agree with the speaker in his statement that hazing is
‘‘a practice we associate with kids.”

The IFC needs to strengthen its rules on Help Week to
insure that the practice of hazing is done away with at W&L.

Every year there seem to be one or two incidents where
some member or members of some fraternity “forget” these
rules.

It is our hope that the Help Week Committee comes up
with a positive set of proposals and that the fraternities ap-
prove these suggestions.

The IFC is to be commended on having Mr. Fletcher speak
to the freshmen pledges. Perhaps this speech could become
an annual occasion, for we feel that the giving of this speech
was a step in the right direction for the IFC.

Thanks

The approval that has been expressed concerning the pub-
lication of the article on W&L’s Honor System is indeed en-
couraging to the Editorial Board of the Tuesday Edition.

We think that Dr. Coulling’s article hit home when he
wrote that the Honor System is ‘‘ours only to preserve.” We
encourage every Washington and Lee student to read this
article. (Extra copies of last Tuesday’s paper are available
in limited supply.)

Again, we would like to thank Dr. Coulling for his effort,
and we thank those students who commended us on the pub-
lishing of this article.

As a further pledge of the Tuesday Edition’s effort to
give W&L an informative newspaper, we assure each student
that our paper will continue to publish articles such as Dr.
Coulling’s.

We sincerely urge all persons who are interested in writing

 

RES IPSA LOQUITUR

 

W&L Should Build Fallout Shelter

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

With lousy weather, a good foot-
ball team, and the impending vaca-
tion all happening
about the same
time it’s hard to
find something to
write about. But
then I was reading
the Hollins news-
paper about some
fireside chats that
the president has
had down there,
and something
struck me as vital.
The response to
STUD on this campus has_ been
hearty, but we’re yet to hear from
any of the girls’ schools about aux-
illary organizations. This may be
because of a circulation defect, but
nevertheless some alternative plan
of survival should be tendered at
this time. This is where the presi-
dent of Hollins comes in, for last
week he deemed fallout important
enough to discuss possible shelter
construction at Hollins.

What is being done here to pro-
vide for the safety of Washington
and Lee students in the event of
atomic attack? Of course, everyone
who takes geology knows where the
county caves are, but so do a lot
of people in the county. And the
vast majority of students know of no
really safe place to hide. The pos-
sible exception to this is the fra-
ternity man who knows that his
house basement has successfully re-
pelled attacks from time immemorial,
but none of these attacks were
atomic.

I think that the situation is
now critical, and if left unthought
about, can do nothing but worsen.
Just think of the things around
here that a post-bomb civiliza-
tion could not function without.
And think of what a crime against
humanity it would be if Wash-
ington and Lee, through negli-
gence, left all our relics (and our-
selves) to fate when the bomb
comes to Lexington. We shouldn’t
delude ourselves into thinking that
Lexington is not a strategic tar-
get, It definitely is, if for no other
reason than it is the home of the
only prints of “Brother Rat”
known to exist.

   

Craven

Right now we have the chance to
act. While you’re home on vacation,
buy a gun. Bring it back to school
with you. And then on Monday the
whole student body will meet be-
hind the law school, bearing arms.
With our sleeves rolled up we can
overpower all the workmen at the
new building, and force the archi-
tect and contractor to redesign the
building into a hugh shelter. Using
all the students trained in ROTC

technique we can keep guards post- |
ed until the job is finished. Since
we'll already be armed we won't!
have to worry about the problem of |
shooting our neighbors in case of |
attack. We’ll simply shoot them be- |
fore the attack in order to neatly |
dispose of that question. While we’re |

at it we can gun down a few pro-
fessors, just to demonstrate our
power. Then maybe we could get
the science majors to work to de-
sign a W&L bomb with which to
retaliate. And if it works out may-
be we can agress just a little to
show the world that you can’t push

W&L men around. And if we agress,
then we will have to be recognized
as a national power, and get a seat
in the UN, and then submit our
plan for a Secretariat, and wreck
that group, and then....

Happy Thanksgiving. You
have the turkey.

Dear Mr Goodwin:

The following is what I consider
to be something of use to you and
your paper.

Foreign caparthagos and integral
meimstroms invading our daily ac-
tivity is something one should never
take lightly. But here, on the W&L
campus, one immediately becomes
aware of such disastrous apathy. To
wit, this lethargic nethralogy is ep-
itomized by the articles published in
the Ping Rum Thi.

For weeks now, the headlines have
mippened with such flashy newsy
tidbits as “X, Y, and Zed, Plan
Affair”! Quallog, thought I a repe-
tition of history on our wallowed
campus! Surruptitiously looking to
my left, (a gauche movement for a
rightist!) in fear of spotting a teen-
age Bircher lurking in the corner,
posing as a left-over from Openings,
I read on and found the “Affair”
merely dealt with Fancy Dress, due
to be held in February. There was a

we shall simply establish mob rule.

done, and by and large, disinterested.

The most recent Occasional Pap-
er to come out from the Center is
written by Henrich Kronstein en-
titled, “Government and Business in
International Trade.” Dr. Kronstein
is both a professor of law at George-
town University in Washington,
D.C., and at Frankfurt University,
Germany. Sinces he divides his time
between Germany and the U.S. he
seems to have acquired a familiar-
ity with our international economic
policy from both the outside and
the inside.

The phamplet, only 10 pages
long, certainly merits reading by
those interested in trade, the Re-
ciprocal Trade Agreements Act
shortly coming up for revision, or
corporations, But the big question
most important to philosophers
and logicians, it seems to me, is
the difference between Govern-

Like Amery,
We Must Spy
On Big Bear

A close study of American Foreign
Policy, with regard to our present
position in inter-
national affairs,
would eventually
lead one to at-
tempt to the es-
tablishment of a
cause and eect
relationship. With
this idea in mind,
I submit to my
readers the par-

   

aa . af able of Little
Knight Amery.
Once upon a

time, there came a small boy to live
in the Noisy Forest. His name was
Little Amery, and he was very well
known in the Noisy Forest.

Another very important person
there was a big brown bear, they
called him “Reddy.” Reddy was very
grim indeed, and he was addicted to
eating very much. His mother had
always told him: “The more you
eat, the stronger you will become”—
never having read a book by Dr.
Spock. And he had a reputation to
keep up. So he went and swallowed
whatever he could find. Nobody
loved him very much for it, but he
did not care.

Little Amery had not been brought
up on those lines. On the whole,
he was a kind boy, even if he did
tend to be somewhat complacent
and to talk too much. He was very
wary of Reddy, because he had been
taught by his mother that gentlemen
always smile. Reddy never smiled,
and therefore, Amery knew that he
could not trust him. And soon Reddy
realized that he could not catch
Little Amery and eat him.

But one fine summer day, after
having read a book by Dale Car-
negie, the bear decided to change
his manners. Reddy began to smile
broadly and exude his manners.
Reddy began to smile broadly and
exude benevolence through every
pore. Everybody was astonished, but
most of all Little Amery. At first,
he was very suspicious. But after-
ward, he remembered what he had
been told as a child: “What smiles
is a gentleman and may be trusted!”
And he began at once to get friend-
ly with Reddy and got to like him.
Reddy’s grin showed clearly that
he was one of the boys and a very
good chap. So Little Amery went to
see Reddy, and in the evening he
curled up in Reddy’s cave to spend
the night there.

In the morning, Reddy called his
wife and told her: “I had a real
gentleman for supper last night. I

Sports Star Of The Week

 

Lanny Butler eludes Frederick tacklers on a long run.

Knight Named All-State;
Breaks Scoring Record

This week’s Sports Star is Dave |
Knight, competitive center forward
on Coach Lyles’ soccer team.

Scores Three

Knight, a four-year’ veteran,
poured in three goals in the booters
win over VPI at the State tourna-
ment last Saturday night. The Gen-
erals overpowered the Gobblers 5-1
to capture third place honors in the
tourney. Virginia edged Lynchburg
College 2-1 in the finals to assert
state soccer supremacy.

Sets Record

Knight has tallied 15 goals this
season for the booters and in do-
ing so set a school scoring record.
For his outstanding play in the
tournament he was named by the
opposing coaches to the All-Oppon-
ent team. Tom Green, W&L goalie,
also received this honor.

Coach Joe Lyles, contemplating
the loss of Knight through gradu-
ation this June, says, “I am sorry
we are losing a boy of Dave’s cali-
ber, both as a soccer player and a
gentleman.”

In the State tournament Friday the
Generals bowed to Lynchburg Col-
lege, 2-1. Freshman inside Gil Sling-| .,
erlin scored the lone W&L goal and, *
was assisted by Dave Knight.

At a meeting of the soccer team
last Friday Tom Clements and Bob

the booters for next season.

Defense Tough

Led by Tommy Keesee, Bob
Payne, and Bill Wheeler, W&L’s
blitz so frightened first string Fred-
erick quarterback James Roaves that
he didn’t get a pass off all day. Only
second stringer Shelby Spain man-
aged to get rid of the ball before
being smothered by a host of blue
jerseys.

Until Saturday W&L had been
known for its stingy rushing de-
fense (seventh in the nation among
small colleges) but its opponents
had been able to gain yardage
via the airways.

Frederick found the Generals’
front wall as tough as ever, and
elected to go to the airways. But
the new blitz foiled the Lions’ aerial
plans. In fact, the Lions picked up
only 19 yards passing for the game.

Substract the 19 yards the Lions
lost rushing and their total offense
| equals ZERO. What more could a
coach ask of his defensive unit than
holding the opponent to ZERO
total yards.

But a great deal of this good de-
fensive play went unnoticed by the
2,500 spectators who were too busy

been considerably higher had not
several long infractions nullified each
other.

It wasn't at all unusual during
the game for the P.A. announcer
to blast, “fourth and 48, fourth

Offensively W&L used Coach Mc-
laughlin’s favorite “big play” to gain
an 18-0 halftime lead and then
added two hard fought touchdowns.

Gummey Scores

Halfback Charlie Gummey, one of
the state’s leading scorers with 42
points, put the Generals on the
scoreboard with only 2:30 gone in
the first period. The speedy back
grabbed a Roaves pass at the W&L
45 and sped 55 yards untouched for
the Generals’ first touchdown.

Frederick opened the touchdown
gates itself early in the second
period when it handed W&L the
football at the Frederick 21 on a
fumble.

It took quarterback Steve Suttle,
who put on a deft offensive show
by gaining 69 yards in six carries,
only three plays to scoot 17 yards
for the score. On the scoring play

Suttle Again

A short punt which rolled dead on
the Frederick 42 set up the Generals’
third touchdown. Suttle was the
hero again, racing the final 30 yards
on the same play he baffled Freder-
ick earlier.

In the five-play drive, Suttle ac-
counted for 39 of the 42 yards, carry-
ing the ball on all but one play.

The second half produced more
exciting football both offiensively
and defensively.

As the game went along the Gen-
erals’ defense seemed to get better.
Frederick picked up five first downs,
three yards rushing, and 23 yards
passing the first half.

In the second half, however, Fred-
erick couldn’t get its offense past
the line of scrimmage. It earned
only one first down, lost 22 yards
rushing and even lost four yards
passing.

Offensively the Generals drove 79
and 44 yards for touchdowns.

Two plays later Russ scored from

Debaters Seek
Added Victory
In NY Tourney

Fresh from a recent victory in the
Virginia Debate Championships, the

Washington and Lee debate team |

faces its toughest competition thus

far this year at a New York Tour-

nament today and tomorrow.

Two sophomores and two seniors |

will represent the university in the
New York University Hall of Fame

Tournament. The four will debate |
the question, “Resolved: That labor

organizations should be under the
jurisdiction of anti-trust legisla-
ttion.”

Debating the affirmative side are
Jay Clark and Robin Wood; negative
debaters are Rosie Page and Al
Eckes. Sophomores Clark and Eckes
were outstanding members of the
team which won the Virginia title.

perience their first intercollegiatex

debate in this tournament.

Making its initial appearance in
the “Hall of Fame” tourney, W&L
will meet such national debating
powers as Holy Cross, Pitsburgh,
Dartmouth, Northwestern, and Johns
Hopkins.

William Chaffin, coach of the team,
noted that it is an honor to receive
an invitation to the meet. Only forty
invitations were issued to over a
hundred colleges which applied.

TB Association
Asks For Funds

Washington and Lee students re-
ceived letters this week requesting
contributions to the 1961 Christmas
Seal campaign of the Rockbridge-
Buena Vista Tuberculosis Associa-
tion.

The letters ask for funds, 87 per
cent of which stay in the County,
to be used for X-rays, research,
rehabilitation and patient services,
and scholarships in the health field.

Mrs. Edward R. Turner, Jr., was
chairman of the student mailing.
She was assisted by faculty wives
Mrs. Westbrook Barritt, Mrs. Leon-
ard Jarrard, Mrs. Paul Hayner, Mrs.
Leland McCloud, and Mrs. John
Wise, as well as Dr. Turner.

In 1960 W&L and VMI contributed
$303 to a total of $6,608 collected in
Rockbridge County.

department is chairman of the Coun-
ty drive.

W&L State Champion Debaters
Worked And Sweated For Success

Publie speaking ability is not the
only quality of a top debate team
and Washington and Lee’s new state
champions will vouch for that.

In order to capture the state title
last week at Bridgewater College,
William Chaffin’s debaters had to put
in some 60 man hours the week be-
fore they competed. Research, prac-
tice sessions, critiques, planning, un-
derstanding of the debate question
and rewriting are required before
the two-man teams can present the
affirmative and negative sides of an
issue.

Preparations for the recent Tau
Kappa Alpha state tournament at
which Washington and Lee out-
argued 14 teams from 10 colleges
in Virginia are only a portion of
the some 100 man hours the teams
and supporters have put in since
the university opened in mid-Sep-
tember.

The State victory for Washington
and Lee also included the capture
of five of the eight top individual
awards offered to Virginia College
debaters. Al Eckes, a sophomore from
Bradford, Pa, and sophomore Wil-
liam Noell, of Bluefield W. Va., tied
for second place individual honors
and as a negative team they were
undefeated with a 4-0 record. Rich-
ard McEnally of New Bern, N. C.,
a sophomore, coped third place on

 

Parsons Speaks At VMI

On Religion

Dr. Talcott Parsons, Chairman of
Harvard’s Dept. of Social Relations,
told an audience at VMI Tuesday
night that President Kennedy’s elec-
tion to the Presidency represents a
great step in the integration of
Protestants and non-Protestants in
America.

“The spell is broken,” Parsons
said, that a Catholic couldn’t win
and that if he did win it would be
disastrous. He stated that although
Kennedy definitely lost votes because
of his religion, it has been proven
that the once firm barrier which
excluded non-Protestants from most
phases of American public life has
been removed.

Parsons, an eminent sociologist
and author, spoke on “The Place of
Organized Religion in American So-
ciety.” His conclusions concerning
Kennedy were the climax of the
speech, which traced the develop-
ment of American religion from
Puritanism.

“We are predominantly derived
from Protestant tradition and from
certain branches of it,’ he said.
This goes back to Calvinism.” The
other major influences were Con-
gregationalism in New England and
Presbyterianism in the South.

The election of John Kennedy is
today’s culmination of a _ process
of liberalization of the Protestant
base, marking a new phase in the
integration of non-Protestant groups
into America’s pluralistic Protestant-
ism. No longer are non-Protestants

 

In America

merely tolerated, they are allowed
full participation in the life of the
nation “as a moral community.”
Parsons saw two factors which
have brought the Catholics and Jews
into more intimate and easy contact
with Protestant society: the fact that
certain members of each minority
group have served as go-betweens
with the majority. In the ease of the
Jew, the middle group was the Re-
formed Jewish church. The Irish,
who had lived close to the Protestant
English for centuries before they
came to America, were the Catholic
group who led in integration with
Protestantism. Parsons called the
Irish “very much of a bridge” of

entry for Catholicism into American |

society.

“No group can remain segregated
in the America of today,” he said.
The speaker cited residential dis-
persion as the main factor in break-
ing up concentrations of minority
groups, thus forcing further inte-
gration of different ways of life.

Parsons stated that it is more
important that Kennedy is a non-
Protestant than tht he is a Catholic.
“In some respects it would have
been as important had he been a
Jew

 

the negative side while the univer-
sity’s affirmative team members—
with a 3-1 record for the tourna-
ment—got third and fourth spots on
their side.

William Boardman, a junior from
Columbus, Ohio, edged out John
Clark, a sophomore from Birming-
ham, Ala., for third place individual
honors by one point. They make up
the Washington and Lee affirmative
team.

The national debate question for
this year—“Resolved: That labor or-
ganizations be subject to the juris-
diction of antitrust legislation”—has
required considerable research for
the W&L students. They’ve stalked
the university’s law library and gen-
eral library week after week bon-
ing up on the legal ramifications of
the question. Conferences with eco-
nomics professors and others re-
garded as experts in the field have
supplemented their research.

Bases for judging a debate team
fall into five categories including
analysis, evidence, argument, refu-
tation and delivery. Each team mem-
ber must be proficient in each of
these categories before his team can
expect a high score.

Schneider Discusses Cold
War From Religious View

The Rev. Mr. William Schneider
told the International Relations Club
last night that to admit, as some
people have, that East-West nego-

bol of America’s religious integre- |

nuclear war is inevitable, is to admit
that our faith in God as a dynamic
force in the universe has failed.

Mr. Schneider, the chaplain to
students at Robert E. Lee Episcopal
Church, said that such a position is
incompatible with the teachings of
the Christian Church.

Citing several Protestant and Ro-
man Catholic moral theologians, and
the opinions of several Christian
bodies, such as those passed by the
Anglican Communion in the Lam-
beth conference, Mr. Schneider
pointed out the difficulty which faces
the Christian regarding modern war-
fare.

Because of the modern weapons
of mass destruction, which could
conceivably wipe out entire popu-
lations, Father Schneider said that
the concept of the “just war” is no
longer a valid one for Christians.
For, in modern warfare, there can
be no ultimate victory; even sur-
vival after such a war is question-

able.

McThenia Calls
Charges False

By STEVE SMITH

Uneas McThenia, while praising
the positive proposals of the Protest
has made it plain that he does not
consider its criticism of his adminis-
tration to be valid.

Speaking in a Wednesday inter-
view concerning the proposals of
the Protest, McThenia said “all these
things either have already been done
or are in a process of consideration.”
But he termed “totally preposterous”
some of the radical Protest stands.

The student body president rec-
ognized Protest as representative of
an important part of the university,
and judged the publication to have
some positive accomplishments to its
credit.

The proposal to have a student
representative to the Lexington
government he noted as excellent,
stating that he plans to use it.
The new position could easily be
instituted in the Student Control
Committee.

 

 

Another recent Protest suggestion,
a call for investigation of the records
of students expelled under the Hon-
or System, was hit as an invasion of
privacy. McThenia singled out this
idea from an article on the Honor
System which he termed “not real-
istic.”

Dwelling on the Protest treatment
of Washington and Lee’s Martin
Luther King incident, McThenia ex-
pressed the opinion that the publi-
cation had gone overboard. While
he saw the necessity for the expres-
sion of opposition to the Board of
Trustees decision, he called for a
more reasonable approach in such
criticism.

Although the Protest demanded
that McThenia do more in the way
of opposing the Board from his
office, the president said that
“anything more would have been
a detriment to the University.” It
accomplishes no good for W&L “to
go out and wave your arms and
raise cain,” he said.

In another interview two weeks
ago, McThenia expressed a desire
for the editor of Protest to “read and
see” the progress made by the Execu-
tive Committee, much of which has
been made little of by the Protest.
He opined that much has been ac-
complished this year.

MeThenia announced a meeting of
an EC committee under Steve Suttle
tonight to continue the work of the
student government in reforming
its operation.

Glee Club To Sing
Messiah” Sunday

Sunday afternoon at four o'clock
the American Theater in Roanoke
will play host to a massed choir
including Washington and Lee’s Glee
Club and the Roanoke Symphony in
a rendition of selections from Han-
del‘s Messiah.

Both groups will be under the di-
rection of Mr. Gibson Morrissey,
full-time director of the Symphony,

The concert is an annual affair
in which the W&L Glee Club has
participated for the past few sea-
sons. The program will include sev-
eral solos plus such well-known
numbers as “Unto Us a Child Is
Born” and the “Hallelujah Chorus”
by the entire group.

The Glee Club has been rehears-
ing for this concert since the latter
part of October, including two re-
hearsals in Roanoke with Symphony.

The Glee Club has three concerts
slated between now and the Christ-
mas holidays in addition to the one
on Sunday. The first will be Tuesday,
December 5, at 8 p.m. in the Lex-
ington Presbyterian Church in joint
concert with the Sullins Choir and
the Brass Choir. The Glee Club
will return Sullins’ visit the follow-
ing Tuesday with a concert at Bris-
tol.

The final concert before the holi-
days will be a Candlelight Service
on Thursday, December 14, in the
R. E. Lee Church at 10 p.m.

 

New Chess Club Begins
Tournament Schedule

The recently formed W&L Chess
Club has begun its intra-club tour-
nament schedule by sponsoring both
two section tournaments. Competi-
tion in the “A” section will determ-
ine the players on W&L’s Chess
Team which will engage the faculty
in a match later this semester. This
match would pit the faculty’s best
seven players against the seven top
men in the Club “A” tournament, in
which Ronnie Moore and Lon Atkins
are leading having won all of their
games to date. Close behind, how-
ever, are Bill Gray, Franco de Bat-
taglia, Chris Conyers and Jack Mar-
tin.

Dr. Wright To
Speak Thursday

Dr. Louis Booker Wright, Direc-
tor of the Folger Shakespeare Li-
brary since 1948, will speak here
next Thursday on “Shakespeare for
Every Man.”

Dr. Wright will appear in Lee
Chapel under the sponsorship of
the English Department.

An American historian as well as
Shakespearian scholar, Dr. Wright
has visited Washington and Lee a
number of times, several years ago
to deliver the Phi Beta Kappa lec-
ture. He received his Ph. D. degree
in 1926 at North Carolina.

Dr. Wright has a varied back-
ground, serving in the U.S. Army
near the end of World War I and
becoming, shortly thereafter, a
newspaper correspondent and edi-
tor. He has served on the facul-
ties of several universities, includ-
ing UCLA, California Institute of
Techonology, Princeton, Amherst,
Rale and Pomona College.

An authority on the South, Dr.
Write has published a number of
books, including Religion and Em-
pire (1942), and The Cultural Life
of the American Colonies (1957). In
addition, he edited The Secret Diary
of William Byrd of Westover, 1702-
1712 in 1941 and The Folger Library
General Reader’s Shakespeare in
1957.

 

 

by the recently chosen Dance
Board Committee is significant for
several reasons. The dress of “High
Society” will simulate that of a
Banquet of State or an Inaugural
Ball and hence will blend well with
the atmosphere of columns and
chandeliers in the Dining Hall.

Costume Prices Reduced

The costumes for the ball will con-
sist of white tie, tails, and other
formal accoutrements for the men
and formal dresses for the ladies.
Therefore, a reduction in the cost of
the costumes has been made pos-
sible, since only the male dress will
be rented; it is assumed that the
girls will provide their own formal
evening gowns.

Frank Young, Dance Board vice-
president, has made arrangements
with the Oak Hall Costume Com-
pany in Roanoke for the provision
of male attire. The costumes will
be made available to students on
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
of next week. Representatives of
the Oak Hall Company will be in
the Student Union on these days to
rent the costumes.

The shift of the setting for the
Fancy Dress Ball from the Doremus
Gymnasium to the Commons is sig-
nificant, but experimental. The Dance
Board in making this change is ful-
filling campaign promises made dur-
ing last year’s elections and is re-
sponding to popular demand.

Extra Expense Involved

The use of the Dining Hall will
involve extra expense and consid-
erable trouble to the Dance Board,
but the decision was made for the
benefit of the students and the pos-
sible enhancement of the unique
reputation of Fancy Dress Ball in
collegiate circles.

The announcement that the Com-
mons would be available was made
following Mr. Mattingly’s statement
of a decision of the faculty and ad-
ministration to that effect.

Galef also said that the Dance
Board will spend more money this
year on Fancy Dress entertainment
than has been spent in the past in
an effort to “make this the best
Dance Weekend in our history.”

Ellington Contracted

It has already been announced that
Duke Ellington has been contracted
to play for the formal ball on the
Friday night after exams, February
2. The entertainment for the con-
cert and dance to be held on Satur-
day the third has already been de-
cided upon and approved by the
student Dance Board Committee;
the public announcement of this in-
formation will be made next week.

Fancy Dress president Bill Ide
and his vice-presidents are already
at work on publicity, stunts, gim-
micks, and decorations to stimulate
student and inter-collegiate inter-
est in the Weekend. Dance Board
members will visit the various fra-
ternity houses during the early part
of next week to encourage students
to participate fully in this annual
social event and to rent their cos-
tumes early.

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

Control Committee On Its Way

Steve Suttle’s report today that the Executive Committee
has received a large number of applications for the student
disciplinary committee indicates that our first reports of a
lack of student interest in the committtee were wrong. We’ve
had a look at the list of men who applied before Tuesday and
are sure that from these applicants alone that an able committee

could be chosen.

Applications for the committee don’t close until Monday,
so anyone interested and qualified to serve on the committee
can still apply for consideration by the EC.

The EC has done an excellent job in getting the student dis-
ciplinary committee through the faculty and administration,
and in explaining it to the student body. But the real work
will be passed on to the new members. They will be largely re-
sponsible for defining the aims and goals of student-adminis-

tered discipline.

They will need a great deal of support from the student
body and will need further to maintain particularly close con-
tact with their fellow students in the first year of the new com-

mittee’s work.

The Ring-tum Phi plans to keep a close watch on their ac-
tivities, and we hope the student body will make their own
views felt through Letters to the Editor.

Not Just An Ethical Question

A great many people, like Dr. Hodges in the interview we
print today, feel that segregation is morally wrong. They have
a right to that opinion. We likewise think that the people who
oppose them have a right to their opinion, and will thereby
refrain from making a judgment here of the Christian ethics

involved.

We do think, however, that the people who are demanding
an immediate forced integration in the schools, bus stations
and restaurants are not justified in their efforts by this disputed
ethical judgment. The great tragedy of the Civil War should
have been demonstration enough of the folly of trying to en-
force a moral precept without regard to the social, economic,
and legal framework of the problem. Even so ardent a group of
integrationists as the editors of Time magazine have been com-
pelled to recognize in the exodus of white pupils from the in-
tegrated public schools of Washington, D.C., that integration
in law and integration in fact are two different things.

If the Negro race is equal in ability to the white, and this is
more an article of faith among sociologists than a scientific
law, it can be best proven by a massive drive by the Negroes
themselves to positions of trust and responsibility. Many
Negroes have done just this. We think that genuine integration
will only take place when the dominant white race is compelled
to recognize by a record of solid accomplishment that the
Negro is indeed equal. This will not happen in one generation,
or even two. An attempt to force the integration too fast can
only create more new differences and hatreds between the races.
Race relations are worse than they were 15 years ago. They

should get no worse.

The Renaissance Of Debate

Washington and Lee is fortunate to have a man with the
ability and interests of Mr. William Chaffin as advisor to the
intercollegiate debate team and the Forensic Union.

Debate wasn’t very important here before he took over last
year. Now we have met with considerable success in intercol-
legiate debate and debating has suddenly become a popular and
well-respected extracurricular activity. Debating activities have
given a healthy intellectual stimulus to the campus.

We think it proves that what we most need here are stimu-

lating and dedicated men on

the faculty. The interest and

ability on the part of students to do good work in most fields
here needs only to be tapped as Mr. Chaffin has done with his

debaters.

 

Behind The News...

The Liberty Hall Society is toying
with the feasibility of publishing a
pamphlet which would _ discuss
frankly the merits and demerits of
all undergraduate courses. It is be-
lieved that such a pamphlet would
help students pick their schedules,
and encourage professors to take a
new look at their courses.

After all is said and done, there
were two sides to the Great Martin
Luther King Debate. Southwestern
at Memphis recently invited a prom-
inent Negro lawyer to speak, and
within twenty-four hours an irate
alumnus had changed his will, strik-
ing out a clause which contained a
grant to Southwestern of more than
$100,000. And a rumor has it that
Randolph-Macon lost at least
$600,000 as a result of last year’s sit-
in episodes.

The trustees might very well have
had these incidents in mind when
they made their decision.

In the wind for next fall: a small
college football conference, com-

 

posed of teams whose athletic poli-
cies resemble the successful Wash-
ington and Lee system. Possible
members include W&L, Sewanee,

Hampden-Sydney, Randolph-Macon,
Franklin and Marshall, and Johns
Hopkins.

More than one professor has been
heard to complain about the fact
that Washington and Lee seems to
stifle creative ability in the faculty.
The feeling is, apparently, that fac-
ulty members do not have the time,
nor the encouragement, to pursue
their own interests. Lack of “intel-
lectual atmosphere” is also a factor,
they say.

Terry Fohs will be a candidate for
Little All-American honors again
this year. Publicity director Frank

thorities of Fohs’ on-field and off-
field accomplishments.

What’s Wrong
With Basketball

Program Here?

By STEVE HENRY

Nothing warms the heart of an
athlete so much as does the sight
of a sizeable crowd turning out
for a game in which he is partici-
pating.

Like, for example, the crowd that
showed up for Monday’s basketball
scrimmage between the W&L var-
sity and freshmen.

Razor-shap, alert, and in perfect
shape after Thanksgiving vacation,
the point-a-minute varsity scored
in every period to post a 25-point
win over the frosh, who made a real
battle out of the game after scoring
their first field goal midway through
the first half.

Nobody in the crowd could quite
figure out if the varsity defense was
that good, or if the freshman of-
fense was that bad. It didn’t really
seem to matter too much to any-
body, because the crowd didn’t have
much to say about the whole per-
formance.

Civilized Crowds

Warnings were given at the be-
ginning of the game that this year
W&L rooters were expected to carry
on the gentlemanly tradition at
basketball games, and to forget the
old days when rabid crowds and
the horrid facilities of Doremus
Gymnasium gave our squads the big-
gest homecourt advantage in college
basketball.

Whoever dreamed up the idea
about our crowds getting civilized
must have forgotten that in the last
two years, W&L has won only one
game on the road, while winning al-
most every game at home.

Something must make the differ-
ence, and we strongly feel that
the big factor (always disallowing
the gym itself) is the way in which
our crowds conduct themselves, with
much cheering, hooting, and jeering.

To ask us to keep quiet and to
be good sports at basketball games
is to invite suicide for the W&L
basketball team’s season record. Ask
the boys from Uva. if you don’t
believe what we’re saying. They have
felt the wrath of a Washington and
Lee crowd.

Basic Problems

While we're on the subject of
basketball, it might be a good time
to bring out a few other things that
occurred to us during Monday’s
scrimmage.

1. W&L has only one good basket-
ball player this year, and no one
needs to be reminded who he is.
Without him, we would be hurting
far worse than the average mind
can comprehend.

2. We have a considerable num-
ber of boys who could be good
basketball players, and will be good
before the season is over, provided
they get good coaching. So far as
we can see it, this is Bob McHenry’s
biggest challenge—to get his boys to
produce.

We believe just about everybody
knows and appreciates his problems.
He has no height and not much ex-
perience. Now that we know it, we
don’t need to hear any more about
it.

3. The best pivot man in school
is playing for the freshmen, and not
for the varsity, where his talents
are sorely needed. The explanation
for this phenomenon is not clear.
Someone told us that the boy is not
in good enough health to play varsi-
ty ball. What in God’s name is he
doing playing freshman ball, then?
This strikes us as being highly para-
doxical, but in a strange way typical.

Junior Varsity Needed

4. The idea of our putting a fresh-
man team on the court, while the
best freshmen are playing varsity, is
somewhat ridiculous, _ especially
when you take into consideration
that most of the members of the
freshman team are refugees from
PE and will never go on to play
varsity basketball in the future. Why
not a J-V team, composed of upper-
classmen and freshmen, thus pro-
viding experience for those inex-
perienced players we're always
hearing about? This would seem
quite logical. Many a senior who
could be playing good ball for the
Generals this year is doing his shoot-
ing for intra-mural teams now. An
adequate J-V program could not
hurt, could only help, General
basketball fortunes.

McHenry openly admits that he’ll
be happy with a .500 season this year.
We personally will be quite sur-
prised and pleased if he manages to
accomplish even this much.

This is all pretty sad when you
remember that not too many years
ago W&L had an authentic All-
American and was playing big-
time college basketball with big-
time basketball players.

Not that we're advocating a re-

An Interview With Dr. Hodges ...

 

Segregation Stands Condemned ©
Judged By Christian Standards

By TRACY HARRINGTON

“There is no respected theologian
in this country who dosen’t agree
that segregation by races in princi-
ple violates Christian ethics.”

Dr. Louis Hodges, Washington and
Lee religion professor, called segre-
gation “a form of limitation of free-
dom based on the denial of equal
opportunity for all men.”

According to him, the Christian
doctrine of God is that God “creates
all men of equal worth.”

“Men are not equal intellectually,
nor are they equal in many other
ways—but they are of equal worth.”

Dr. Hodges expounded on the
Christian attitudes toward “equality
of worth,” as he called it.

He said that “it is just as worth-
ful in the eyes of God for an ignor-
ant man to develop his potential as
it is for an intelligent man to de-
velop his.

“Segregation denies this oppor-
tunity for equal development of po-
tential.”

Stereotype Problem

How does segregation do this?

“When the Negro or any member
of a group is unfavorably stereo-
typed, he doesn’t have a chance to
prove himself. The scales are weight-
ed against him.”

Dr. Hodges described how this
stereotyping occurs.

“One observes that many Negroes
have undesirable characteristics. We

The Virginia
(Review of “Gentlemen of Vir-

ginia, by Marshall W. Fishwick.
Dodd, Meade & Company. $5.00.)

We at Washington and Lee hear
a good deal about the mystical no-
tion of the gentleman and now one
of our professors has written a book
dealing with the subject.

Dr. Marshall Fishwick’s recent edi-
tion to his series of Virginia studies,
entitled Gentlemen of Virginia, is
composed of a series of biographical
sketches of exemplary Virginia
gentlemen interspersed with chapters
given over to various aspects of
Virginia culture reflecting the
gentlemanly tradition.

This volume will be found by the
student to be as pleasant, and at
times as inebriative, as the local
beverage of a similar name. Raleigh,
Smith, Berkeley, and William Byrd,
II, are the pre-Revolutionary men
we meet.

Raleigh, who incidentally never
came to Virginia, is discussed be-
cause, given the luck to meet the
Queen at a “plashy place” and hav-
ing a new coat to lay at her feet,
he “caught, in one symbolic act,
what the generation stood for and
died for.”

Similarly, Smith, who by most ac-
counts was a rogue and scoundrel,
becomes the man of the hour who
saved Jamestown and thus took a
place in “an aristocracy of action.”

Berkerley is shown by Dr. Fish-
wick to have become an unjustifiable
goat of the historians. Fishwick’s
account, which is quite plausible,
portrays him as a Royal governor
who had both the good of the col-
ony and a strong concept of Anglo-
Saxon liberty in his heart during
the suppression of Bacon’s Rebel-
lion.

Treatment of Byrd Poor

The author’s treatment of William
Byrd, II, suffers from a lack of that
feeling of intimacy with the subject
matter which he developed so well
in his accounts of Smith and Ber-
keley. Perhaps our good professor
felt constrained to overlook the
racier side of Byrd’s life in an effort
to maintain the respectability of the
book in the eyes of those fine old
ladies to whom Virginia tradition
means so much.

At any rate the more worldly

tend to make from this the unwar-
ranted conclusion that all Negroes
have these characteristics.

“On this basis, when one encount-
ers an individual Negro, he tends
to deal with that Negro as if he
has these undesirable characteris-
tics.”

As far as the Negro in the South
is concerned, Hodges said “it is true”
that “on the whole, the Negro is
inferior to the white man in terms
of health standards, education, and
moral standards, taken in general.”

He added, however, that “it would
not be true to say that any given
Negro is inferior to any given white
person in these respects.”

“Some Negroes,” he said, “are
superior to some whites in these
areas.”

Dr. Hodges could not see a moral
violation in segregation by superiori-
ty, as long as all were given full
opportunity to develop their poten-
tial. “But racial segregation does
not separate superior from infer-
ior.”

The Role of the Church

As for the Christian Church as a
whole, Dr. Hodges described its
goal regarding desegration of the
races as “the same as that of the
NAACP.”

Turning from the general ques-
tion of Christian ethics versus the
racial problem in the South, Dr.
Hodges spoke of the dilemma as it
affects Washington and Lee.

 

“In principle segregation is con-
trary to the Christian ethic,” he said.

“If we at Washington and Lee are
to seek to inculcate the Christian
ideal, we must deal with the ques-
tion of race relations and Christian
ethics.”

He said that we are dealing with
the problem. “We are discussing it
right now on campus.”

What About W&L?

In response to a question about
the all-white admissions policy of
W&L, Dr. Hodges said the univer-
sity “is not necessarily run accord-
ing to Christian ethics in regard to
admission policies—it does not make
this claim.”

Concluding his comments, Dr.
Hodges talked about segregation and
the future.

He said segregation is a “permis-
sable” step between slavery and total
integration. “The Negro has been
raised somewhat under segregation.”

“Segregation,” he said, “is defi-
nitely out as far as law is concerned.

“But prejudice is not out. Hence
there will be subtle extra-legal
forms of segregation as long as there
is racial prejudice.”

What does this mean, then, to
Christians?

“It means that the objective of
the Christian Church is to work in
what every ways it can to remove
these prejudices.”

Gentleman: Past & Present

undergraduate is admonished to go
directly to Byrd’s secret diaries lest
he get the wrong impression of that
exuberant rake.

The sketches of George Mason,
George Washington, and Thomas
Jefferson reveal that these men held
ideals in common which, apparently
assisted in producing the marvelous
ideas enshrined in our form of gov-
ernment.

Fishwick, with his characteristic
wit, cites the story of Calvin Cool-
idge who, during the cynical period
of debunking of these heroes in the
Twenties, was told of charges that
Washington was vain, carnal, and
undemocratic. Silent Cal walked
over to the window, looked out, and
said “Washington’s monument is
still there.”

Fishwick’s Scheme Exposed

Now the theme of Fishwick’s
book becomes apparent. It is: a long

 

time ago Virginia had some great
men, they did some great things.
They also had a gentlemanly ideal.
Over the years Virginia’s greatness
and her men have declined.

Why? Because the gentlemanly
ideal is still professed, yet it has
lost its original validity. Only the
surface, superficial aspects of the
gentleman are given consideration
while the underlying values of the
gentlemanly ideal have been forgot-
ten.

Fishwick demonstrates with a

It is the responsibility of each student to know the time and place of
meeting of each of his examinations. The hours for examinations are 9:00-
12:00. and 2:00-5:00. Any student more than five minutes late must present
a satisfactory reason for his lateness to be allowed to take the examina-

tion.

The omission of a student of any regular examination causes him to for-

CAGERS TO FACE IMPROVED WAHOOS

Season Opens With Generals
Lacking Height, Experience

Washington and Lee will get a chance to prove that height
does not necessarily win basketball games in its season opener

at Virginia tonight.

The Five-Star Generals’ starting line-up boasts no one

taller than captain Rodger “Bip’*

Fauber of Lynchburg, at a towering
6-2. On the other hand, Virginia’s
first five averages 6-2 with sopho-
more center Richard Katstra top-
ping the Cavaliers at 6-9.

Joining Fauber in the W&L start-
ing line-up tonight are Bill Ide, a
6-1 guard who was switched to for-
ward this year; Bill Smith, 6-2
center; and Tom and Jon Supak, a
pair of 6-1 guards who transferred
to W&L this year from William and
Mary.

Displaying a mixture of phenom-
enal shooting, shooting, hustle and
desire, the Generals upset a taller
Virginia squad, 78-68, here last year;
but this year the road to victory
will be even harder for the “cru-
sading midgets.”

“We figure we'll hit 50 per cent
of our shots from the floor to
whip them,” said General coach
Bob McHenry.

“We'll have to play a real scrappy
defense, and make them play slop-
pily. We'll also have to work ex-
tremely hard on offense to get the
good percentage shots,” he said.

Fauber and Ide are the only re-
turning lettermen from last year’s
squad which posted a 7-11 mark.
Fauber had a 14.2 scoring average
and a 168 rebound average last
year. Ide, who came into his own
late in the season, produced a 5.0
scoring average.

Fauber certainly remembers the
Generals’ upset of Virginia last
year in which he scored 26 points
and grabbed 24 rebounds, but he is
also very aware of the type of
game W&L will have to play in
order to win: We’ll have to give it
everything we’ve got, to beat Vir-
ginia again this year,’ the captain
emphasized.

Virginia’s two returning starters—
guard Tony Laquitano and forward
Gene Engel—also should well re-
member their harsh upset at the
Generals’ hands.

“Coach McCann won't need to
say a word to his squad to get them
up for us,’ McHenry said. “I’m
sure they recall last year well
enough.”

But McHenry quickly added:

“We've been pointing for them
for all six weeks of pre-season prac-
tice. We really want to beat them
again.”

The Generals’ biggest worry will
come from Virginia’s frontline sky-
scrapers—6-9 Katstra, 6-4 Engel and
6-4 Hunter Conner. These three have
a combined edge of 12 inches over
W&L’s front-liners. At guard the
Generals have a slight height ad-
vantage.

 

 

Local Hunting
Seasons Open
Until January

A game official at the Rockbridge
County Courthouse said that 4335
deer hunting stamps have been sold
in the county this year. This is an
increase of 600 over last year’s sales.
The sale of all types of hunting per-
mits and licenses has increased this
year.

The deer season for Rockbridge
County was November 20-25. A
hunter could shoot one deer a sea-
son, for the first three days of either
sex, and for the last three days
bucks only.

There is a continuous open season
on hunting squirrels and hunting
foxes with dogs. Fox hunting with
guns is limited to October 2-January
$1.

The bag limit on squirrels is six
a day and 75 a season. There is no
bag limit on foxes.

Rabbits, grouse, and quail may be
hunted November 20-January 5.
Pheasant hunting is prohibited out-
side of licensed shooting preserves.
Elk hunting is prohibited.

More complete information and
the necessary licenses may be ob-
tained at the Rockbridge County
Courthouse.

 

Frosh Basketballers
Open Season Saturday

Washington and Lee’s freshman
basketball team opens a 13-game

in Doremus
Fork Union.

Coach Joe Lyles’ squad, which
dropped a practice scrimmage to the
W&L varsity by 25 points last Mon-
day, is counting heavily on the ser-
vices of 6’ 3” Jerry Kowalski, who
was outstanding against the varsity.

Kowalski, the younger brother of
former Washington and Lee starting
varsity forward Ken Kowalski, plays
pivot for the baby Generals.

Lyles also praised forward Dick
Livingston for his performance
against the varsity.

Generals Place Five Men
Among Top State Scorers

Five members of Washington and
Lee’s undefeated football team were
among top ten scorers in Virginia
football for the 1961 season.

Junior halfback Charlie Gummey
and senior Doug Martin led the
Generals with 54 points apiece, good
enough for a second place showing
on the overall state scoreboard.

Richmond’s Earl Stoudt, who clos-
ed out his college career with a 26
point showing against William and
Mary on Thanksgiving Day, over-
took both Gummey and Martin for
first place, ending up with a total
of 67 points for the year.

FB Captains

Tommy Keesee, Charlie Gummey,
and Bob Payne have been named
co-captains for the 1962 Washing-
ton and Lee football team, it was
announced yesterday.

All three are rising seniors.

Keesee, a 185-pound fullback from
Memphis, Tenn., moved into the first
string General line-up for the first
time this year. Not including sta-
tistics for the Washington game, he
picked up 251 yards in 64 carires for
a 3.9 yard rushing average.

For the season, he scored 28
points, good enough to place sixth
in Virginia college scoring.

A 70-yard run against Carnegie
Tech during his sophomore year
gave W&L a 6-0 win, and earned
Keesee back-of-the-week honors
from the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

**HAPPINESS CAN’T BUY MONEY”

I have asked the makers of Marlboro—an enterprising and
aggressive group of men; yet at the same time warm and lovable;
though not without acumen, perspicacity, and drive; which does
not, however, mask their essential great-heartedness; a quality
evident to all who have ever enjoyed the beneficence of their
wares; I refer, of course, to Marlboro Cigarettes, a smoke
fashioned with such loving care and tipped with such an easy-
drawing filter that these old eyes grow misty when I think upon
it—I have asked, I say, the makers of Marlhoro—that aggregate
of shrewd but kindly tobacconists, that cluster of hearty souls
bound together by the profit motive and an unflagging deter-
mination to provide a cigarette forever flavorful and eternally
pleasing—I have asked, I say, the makers of Marlboro whether
I might use today’s column to take up the controversial question:
Should a coed share expenses on a date?

“Yes,” said the makers simply. We all shook hands then and
squeezed each other’s shoulders and exchanged brave smiles,
and if our eyes were a trifle moist, who can blame us?

To the topic then: Should a coed share expenses on a date?
I think I can best answer the question by citing the following
typical case:

Poseidon Nebenzal, a student at Oklahoma A and M, major-
ing in hides and tallow, fell wildly in love with Mary Ellen
Flange, a flax weevil major at the same school. His love, he had

 

On folsh eer ye out Ca bebe? °
reason to believe from Mary Ellen’s sidelong glances and

maidenly blushes, was not entirely unrequited, and by and by he
mustered up enough courage to ask her the all-important

question: ‘Will you wear my 4-H pin?”

“Yes,” she said simply. They shook hands then and squeezed
each other’s shoulders and exchanged brave smiles, and if their
eyes were a trifle moist, who can blame them?

For a time things went swimmingly. Then a cloud appeared.
Mary Ellen, it seems, was a rich girl and accustomed to costly
pleasures. Poseidon was bone-poor and he quickly ran out of
money. Unable to take Mary Ellen to the posh places she
fancied and too proud to tell her the reason, he turned surly and
full of melancholy. Soon their romance, so promising at the
beginning, was headed for a breakup. But at the last moment,
Poseidon managed to blurt out the truth.

“Oh, beloved agrarian!’ cried Mary Ellen, grappling him
close. “Oh, proud husbandman! Oh, foolish reaper! Why have
you not told me before? I have plenty of money, and I will
contribute according to my ability.”

Poseidon, of course, protested, but she finally persuaded him
of the wisdom of her course. From then on they split all expenses
according to their incomes. Rather than embarrass Poseidon by
handing him money in public, a joint bank account was set up
to allow him to write checks. Into this account each week they

faithfully deposited their respective allowances—:
Poseidon; $2300 from Mary Ellen.
And it worked fine! They were happy

35 cents from

truly happy! And

what’s more, when they graduated they had a nice little nest
egg—eight million dollars—with which to furnish a lovely
apartment in Lubbock, Texas, where today they operate the
local laundromat.
So you see? You too can salvage your failing romance if you
will only adopt a healthy, sensible attitude toward money.

at Kennedy’s inauguration, and that
in the armed services chaplains of
all faiths are accorded equal status.
Constitution Clinched Secularization

The United States’ Constitution
was named by the speaker as a
major step in the development of
America’s organized religion as well
as a crucial break with tradition in
the separation of church and state.
This “secularization” of religion was
followed by Parsons to the present
day.

He defined secularization as a pro-
cess of differentiation by which re-
ligion becomes a progressively smal-
ler part of the whole life. This
process need not be anti-religious in
the least .

The movement, for Christianity,
began under the leadership of St.
Paul, when the early Christian

church broke with the Jewish com-
munity. Christianity went through
stages to become the official religion
of the Roman Empire; then it had
to begin anew after the breakup of
the Western empire.

The differentiation relevant to
Parsons’ topic began in the Middle
Ages. For centuries the state gov-
ernment was controlled by the
church; later the state became in-
dependent but remained fully Chris-

tian in character. Finally, America
is completely tolerant of all religions,
although the American society re-
mains primarily a Theistic one.

Parsons expressed the opinion that
although religion has lost much of
its function in the process of secular-
ization, the blow sustained is only a
superficial one .

Religion and Secular Science

Debunking the theory that religion
is at odds with science, Parsons saw
the two as co-workers. He said that
it was a favorite Puritan formula
that science is a way of coming to
know God through understanding
his works. Therefore, science is not
likely to be an attempt to find a
substitute for God.

He noted that there were many
Puritans in England’s Royal Society,

the most eminent being Robert
Boyle. Johnathan Edwards, New
England minister was _ probably

America’s greatest philosopher down
to recent years, the most important
single transmitter of the ideas of
Locke and Newton.

good professor’s characterization of
the legendary Lee as “Guardian
Angel Lee.”

The treatment of Henry Martin,
the founder of the Democratic ma-
chine in Virginia, is interesting but
couched in terms intended to im-
plement the author’s theme. The
final chapter deals with George C.
Marshall and it appears that Dr.
Fishwick might be attempting to
assist in the making of a new leg-
end here.

It seems surprising that though
the Marshall Plan and foreign policy
in Europe are lauded, the contro-
versial part played by Marshall dur-
ing the fall of China to commun-
ism is scarcely noted.

Wahoo Riots Well Recorded

While the memory of recent riots
at the University of Virginia lingers
in our minds, it might be worthwhile
to mention that Dr. Fishwick did an
admirable job in researching the his-
torical background of such phenom-
ena. His chapter on “Cavalier Train-

of the Wahoos prior to the War.

proceeded the Great Riot of 1836
was the punishment administered by
the students to a faculty member
who had rebuked a student in class
for the use of indecent language.
“Nor was the issue closed with
all that. Later on Harrison was ap-
prehended by two incensed members
of the student body. While one held

him tightly, the other ‘laid on vigor- |

ously with a stout horsewhip.’

“The increase of such bold acts
forced the faculty to pass on ordi-
nance ordering all students to their
rooms in case of rows or riots. That
did it. Irate cavaliers decreed a mass
meeting in Hotel C. Officials locked
the door; the students smashed it
down and entered. After some ap-
propriately inflamable remarks a
student resolution was adopted con-
demning the faculty order, and ad-
vising that it simply be ignored.
With that the students adjourned to
toast their good sense and breeding.”

Often Professor Fishwick is ac-
cused of being glib. At times he is;
how else explain the extraordinary
confusion of the word “ancestor”
for “descendant” which he no doubt
intended on page 158? Despite this
occasional lapse, much of what Mar-
shall Fishwick has to say is quite
profound.

And whether superficial or pro-
found, the way he expresses him-
self is always interesting and quite
often a hell of a lot of fun.

basketball player would be stupid
to come here.

It’s a disappointing situation for
team, coach and student body. A
re-assessment of Washington and
Lee’s basketball program is in order.

In closing, we want to say a word
of thanks to that honorable institu-
tion, the PE department, which
provided what might be the biggest
basketball crowd of the season last
Monday by making the game manda-
tory for all freshmen and sophomore
PE classes.

We are quite sure that it was a
most satisfying intellectual exper-
ience for all involved. We hope that
the administration will consider
making all home athletic events
compulsory.

Like required university assem-
blies, it would be a good and healthy
thing, and meaningful, too.

Dr. J. C. Robert

TUESDAY
Edition

By STEVE GUILD
Executive News Editor

Dr. Joseph C. Robert, former President
of Hampden-Sydney College, will be the
principle speaker for the 47th Annual ODK
Tap Day.

The yearly event at Washington and Lee
will be held this year on December 12 to
recognize outstanding leadership abilities
in students, faculty, and alumni.

The Tap Ceremony will be held at 12:00
followed by a luncheon in Evans Dining
Hall.

Dr. Robert, a native of State College,
Mississippi, is now professor of history at
the University of Richmond. He received
his A.B. and LL.D. degrees from Furman
College in 1927 and 1959 respectively. He
also received an A.M. and a Ph.D. from
Duke between 1929 and 1933. He received
an honorary Doctor of Literature degree

from Washington and Lee when he was on
the campus in 1958.

Following his work at Duke Dr. Robert
spent the ensuing years in various teach-
ing positions at several universities, until
he was asked to be President of Coker Col-
lege in 1952. He served in this position un-
til 1955 when he took the presidency of
Hampden-Sydney.

He remained there until 1960 when he
received a Ford Foundation grant to study
the different aspects of European universi-
ties. It was then that he left Hampden-
Sydney and upon returning to the United
States took the professorship of history at
Richmond.

Dr. Robert has done much work and re-
search into the development of the tobac-
co industry and has written several books
on the subject, including The Tobacco
Kingdom and The Story of Tobacco in
America.

Omicron Delta Kappa was founded forty-
seven years ago at Washington and Lee
for the purpose of “bringing together cam-
pus leaders in a more relaxed atmosphere.”
From that time the honorary fraternity has
grown in stature until there are now over
ninety chapters or circles at universities
and colleges throughout the country.

The idea for the organization of a so-
ciety to recognize superior citizenship and
leadership came from W&lL Professor Ru-
pert N. Latture and his college roommate
James C. Fisher. The idea was presented to
several members of the faculty and with
their support and the approval of Univer-
sity president Dr. Henry Louis Smith a
small group was formed “to bridge the gap
between faculty and students and help
make clear the aspirations of each.”

The purpose of this newly-formed group
was threefold: (1) to recognize men who
have attained efficiency in collegiate activi-

Dr. J. C. Robert Is Speaker For ODK Tap Day

ties; (2) to bring together the most repre-
sentative men in all phases of college life;
and (3) to collect members of the faculty
and student body of an institution on the
bases of mutual interests and understand-
ing.

The rapid spread of the organization
after its formation was due partly to the
recognition that it could fill a gap in the
student-faculty relations in many univer-
sities and colleges. In many schools mem-
bership in ODK is the “highest honor on
campus” and is reserved for only a small
portion of the student body.

The new initiates of ODK are chosen by
the members who have been tapped in
previous years. These me nhold several
meetings prior to the actual ceremony to
determine those to be initiated on ODK
Day. At present there are ten student
members at Washington and Lee, two un-
dergraduates and eight law students.

BRUBECK TO PLAY FOR °62 FD CONCERT

 

IFC Passes New Pledge Training Resolution

IFC Passes Special Resolution;
Curbs Use On Pledge Training

Washington and Lee’s IFC last night passed a sweeping
amendment to its constitution that will curb the pledge train-
ing activities of fraternities for the first semester of this year

and for years to come.

Prompted to action by a formal complaint which was re-
cently issued against two of the 18 fraternities by a member
of the W&L faculty, the IFC passed the resolution by a 13-2

vote.

The resolution, in effect, states that
(1) no fraternity can hold “training”
sessions after 11 p.m. during the first
semester; (2) these sessions must be
held inside the fraternity houses;
(3) the IFC hopes that the Univer-
sity would forward all complaints
made to the Dean’s Office and to
the University Proctor to the IFC
President for further action, and (4)
a fine of not less than $50.00 nor
more than $100.00 be placed on
houses who violate this rule.

The IFC withheld the names of the
two houses against whom the com-
plaint was lodged; but it was an-
nounced since this case prompted
the legislation and had occured pre-
vious to it, the offending houses
would only be verbally reprimanded
and no fines imposed.

The amendment was passed in the
IFC’s regular meeting, and the ques-
tion of punishment for the two
houses involved was forwarded to
the IFC’s Judicial Committee which
is composed of all the fraternity
presidents.

The complaint against the fraterni-
ties was explained by IFC Presi-
dent Doenges who pointed out that
there had been a number of per-
sons complaining that training ses-
sions were causing excessive noise
in the streets, that the sessions had
been keeping the pledges out too
late; and that the IFC had no posi-
tive regulations dealing with pledg-
ing activities during the first se-
mester.

It was pointed out by a number
of fraternity spokesmen that they
wanted some type of police action
to be set up to restrict the area of
“training session” activity.

The amendment is as follows:
“It is resolved that all pledge
training sessions during the first
semester must end by 11 p.m., and
that these activities must take
place inside of the fraternity hous-
es. It is the request of the IFC that
all complaints to the University
Proctor or to the Dean’s Office
in the future be forwarded to the
President of the IFC for action.

The fine shall not be less than $50 |

nor exceed $100 and shall be levied
at the discretion of the Judicial
Committee.”

IFC is capable of handling its own
affairs.

The voting on this_ resolution
showed that 13 houses favored the
amendment, two opposed, one ab-
stained from voting, and two houses
were absent.

Doenges pointed out in the regu-
lar meeting that the complaint had
been sent to Dean Frank J. Gilliam
by a member of the Faculty. Dean
Gilliam, he said, forwarded the com-
plaint to the IFC for action.

In other’ business, President
Doenges gave a report on his trip

Costumes For Fancy Dress Ball

To Be Placed On Sale This Week

BY ANDY NEA

Managing Editor
Dave Brubeck, internationally acclaimed as one of the
world’s foremost jazz personalities, has been signed to play at
the Fancy Dress Concert, it was announced today by Dance

Doremus Gymnasium from 3

. Brucek’s appearance will add
to the top entertainers scheduled to appear during this year’s

Brubeck’s currently riding crest of new-found popularity
in the “top twenty” bracket with his recording of ‘'Take Five.”

enough of his importance to feature
him on their cover.

Has Many Albums

A glance at the list of Brubeck
recording makes apparent the broad-
ness and versatility of his talent. In
addition to regular albums of stand-
ard jazz tunes, there are such origi-
nal albums as “Time Out” and “Time
Further Out” which are far re-
moved from the usual jazz style.
Soon to be released is a record
featuring Brubeck and Louis Arm-
strong.

Paul Desmond

Each member of the Brubeck
Quartet has won impressive recog-
nition and is a soloist in his own
right. Paul Desmond, alto sax, Joe
Morello, drums, and Gene Wright,
bass, combined with the fabulous
piano of Brubeck makes an unbeat-
able combination.

Brubeck’s appearance at this year’s
53rd Faney Dress Weekend is ex-
pected to augment the dance set
greatly. Duke Ellington has already
been signed to play for the Fancy
Dress Ball to be held Friday, Feb-
ruary 1.

As was announced last week, the
theme of this year’s Ball is to be
High Society. The Friday night
dance will be held in the Commons,
a new feature this year.

Dress will be conventional for the
concert to be held in the gym. The
time of the concert might possibly
be changed so as to reduce the con-
flict with fraternity house parties.
A meeting of the Dance Board pres-
ident with the fraternity social
chairmen is scheduled for this week.

Costumes for the Fancy Dress
Ball will go on sale this week.
They will be sold from Wednesday
through Friday in the Student
Union from 9:20 to 5:00 p.m. The
dress will simulate that of a Ban-
quet of State or an Inaugural Ball
and will consist of tails for the
men and formals for the ladies.
This has made it possible to reduce
cost of costumes to $10.00 as only
male dress will be rented.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Editorially Speaking

Press Of Virginia Hails Faculty
For Posttion On Free Inqutry

Now that the Martin Luther King issue seems to have
passed, and now that the dust has slowly begun to settle from
this controversy, we feel that several statements which recently
have been made in the press of Virginia are worthy of con-
sideration.

 

During the last few days, favorable comment which was
directed at W&L has appeared in the press of this state. This
comment has been concerned with the faculty’s resolution of
disagreement with the University Trustees’ decision to ban Dr.
King from speaking here.

By no means in bringing this issue back to the Ring-
tum Phi does the Tuesday Edition wish to become the
“King Clarion,” as we have been called. As we have re-
peatedly said earlier in editorials, we do not agree with
the ideas that Dr. King holds on segregation, and we are
not going to take this opportunity to change our former
stand.

Washington and Lee’s faculty has been heralded by the
press for a statement which was released before Thanksgiving
by Dr. Cole at the request of the faculty. This statement was
that “This decision, (of the Trustees) in the opinion of the
faculty, seriously limits the freedom of inquiry, that should pre-
vail in an institution of higher learning, and denies to students
the opportunity to learn and judge for themselves, even upon
issues of controversy.”

As was pointed out in no less than three different newspap-
ers published in Virginia, the crux of this controversy, as it ap-
pears to us, was that no university or college should ever deny
students free inquiry—even in the case of a controversial figure.

The Roanoke Times on November 23 in their editorial
“Good For W&L’s Faculty!” said that “The teachers deserve
applause for their boldness and loyalty to one of the deepest
obligations of their profession—defense of the right to know.
In going on record in this fashion they have redeemed the uni-
versity from an unfortunate impression created by the board.”

“Free Inquiry at Washington and Lee” was the editorial
which the Norfolk Virginia-Pilot printed on November 24;
“The faculty’s attitude is so clearly in conformity with the great
traditions of university freedom, of the virtues of free inquiry,
and of the rights of men to examine ideas in the competition
of the market-place that it is surprising that a university faculty
has to recall these fundamentals of American life.”

The November 22 issue of the Norfolk Ledger-Star, in
editorial, “A Halo And A Dunce Cap,” added to the cause
of free inquiry by saying that ‘We note the trustee’s acknowl-
edgement of Washington and Lee’s faculty’s concern for free-
dom of inquiry.”” (This reference to a statement made by Mr.

James R. Caskie of Lynchburg who is one of the Trustees of
We&L.)

The editorial continues by saying, “If we may say so, the
university would be better off if the trustees had shared that
concern. For in turning down approval for his appearance on
the campus, the trustees have thoughtlessly placed a halo of
seeming martyrdom on a man they distrust and a dunce-cap on
a university they love. It goes without saying that neither was
their purpose. But it remains to be added that they can recon-
sider—and they ought to do so.”

The members of the Washington and Lee faculty
are, indeed, to be hailed for their stand. Many profes-
sors possibly placed themselves in a “‘strained’’ light by
supporting a cause which disagrees with a decision of
the Trustees. To the faculty that went on public record
in their decision to uphold the right of free inquiry we
say “thanks.”

We are indebted to you for your position on this matter,
and we are thankful for your trying to uphold the name of a
fine university—Washington and Lee.

End of story, end of song.

—R. R. G.

Pamphlet Is A Good Idea

The Liberty Hall Society, as we understand it, is toying
with the idea of publishing a pamphlet which would discuss the
good points and the drawbacks of all the courses in Washington
and Lee’s undergraduate school.

It has long been the opinion of many students that such
a measure should have been taken by some organization long
before this.

The Tuesday Edition supports this move by the Liberty
Hall Society, and we wish them the best of luck in their efforts.

We agree with the Friday Edition’s “Behind the News...”
which said that “such a pamphlet would help students pick
their schedules, and encourage professor to take a new look
at their courses.”

Such a pamphlet indeed would be a move in the best inter-
ests of Washington and Lee, and we think that the Liberty
Hall Society has hit upon a good idea.

Cotillion Offers Contrast To

Everyone should go to the Cotil-
lion at Hollins once in his lifetime.
It would probably be better to go
after you get out of school, but
you should make it once. The
Hotel Roanoke is really a change
from fraternity basements; almost

as big a switch as drinks in glass-
es instead of paper cups.

And it really is fun to put on
a tux, too, and then to make all
the variations on the traditional
theme by wearing a striped but-
ton-down shirt, unmatched cum-
merbund and tie, white sox and un-
shined brown Weejuns. And chicks

 

Honts Classifies The Twist—
Nature Girl, John Birch Types,
Members Of Nervous Navels Club

By GEORGE HONTS
Tuesday Columnist

Personally I'll be glad when the
Twist has gone the way of the
Charleston, the Ramble and the
immortal Fox Trot.
It gives me a
tummy ache. And
for me that is a
@ big problem.

' Nonetheless the
Twist is here and
_ there’s not much
we can do but
hope the human
body will hold to-
gether until it
goes away.

Unlike stacking
people in phone booths or running
down old ladies in souped-up
sports cars, the Twist is no longer
the sole property of the college set.
Wealthy old women do it to ‘reduce,’
27-month-old brats have been
caught at it, and the rumor is that
John Kennedy didn’t wrench his
back while breaking ground after all.

I have witnessed one 80-year-old
gentleman doing it. He wore out
three partners in the course of an
evening.

  

Honts

I'm told they are doing it in all
the fashionable night spots and
clubs across the country, but I
haven't been anywhere except
Doc’s lately so we'll have to rely
on hearsay.

Barring trips to the Twilight Zone,,
I plan to make a detailed study of
Twisters at all the future combo
parties and then write a book about
it. Also there are plans afoot to
form a Twisters’ Club to study the
various techniques. It'll be called
Nervous Navels Anonymous and will
meet every Wednesday in the Stu-
dent Union. Anyone can join pro-
vided they have a navel that’s
nervous and can pass the three-
hour Twisters’ entrance exam. If
you are really interested it might
be wise to bring along an auto-
graphed picture of Buster Brown or
a lock of Chubby Checker hair.

But I have digressed. I want to
tell you about my book. Actually I
began my study of twisters this
weekend and I made considerable
progress until I collided with a big
bird about 11 o'clock.

There is, I found, one type of girl
who can be classified as a John
Birch Twister—very conservative.
This type twists like she had just
stepped on some _ second-handed
chewing gum and is frantically try-
ing to scrape it off. Actually she’s
no fun to twist with unless it’s
after midnight and you are tired,
or there are so many people at the
party you are forced to twist in a
broom closet.

More fun and twice as dangerous
to twist is the Nature Girl. For
instance, I picked out one demure
looking young lady Saturday night
and asked for a dance. Had she
been older she could have passed
for Whistler's Mother—but, ye
gods, when the music started she
went off like a neurotic popcorn

 

popper. She twisted twice around
the room, out the door and into
the street.

To save face there was nothing I
could do but twist along. Much later
when I was alone and had time to
check, I found my appendectomy
sear has been stretched a good three
inches. That, of course, was after a
couple of faithful fraternity broth-
ers had gathered up that heap on
the pavement that was me.

Probably the most popular type
of twister is the Handy-man. If your
tummy is cramped from too much
twisting, wave your hands over your
head, throw your arms out to either
side and give with an up and down
motion like you were juggling base-
balls. That way if anyone is watch-
ing you they are distracted by the
hand motions and don’t notice if
you are wiggling or not.

Another popular variety of Twist-
er is the Half-tracker. He raises
one leg until his foot is parallel
with the floor. The rib cage goes one
way, the pelvic...er...area goes
another and that extended foot yet
another. It’s charming to watch and
may prove to be a scientific boon. If
we ever get that other foot off the
floor there is hope we'll break
through to the long sought fourth
dimension.

Maybe it’s an old variation, I
hadn’t noticed until recently, though;
but one of my roommates dribbles
an imaginary basketball while he
twists. He’s a fairly normal, red-
blooded American boy, but when he
goes up for a jump shot I wonder.
This variety defies classification.

The last category I noted this
weekend was the Up and Down
Twister. Twist a while standing and
twist a while in a modified squatting
position.

This type of twisting requires
agility, coordination and a deli-
cate sense of balance since you’re
going four ways at once. That,
or you probably can do it if you
have a pot belly that is counter-
balanced ala posterior. I fall into
the second sub-classification and
have achieved remarkable success
as an Up and Down Twister.

So the foundation is laid for my
book. If anybody has any advice or
information to offer pick up a couple
dates and twist over to our place.
We'll draw the curtains, lock the
doors, and, with the volume down
low but on the soundtrack of “The
Guns of Navarone.” That should be
a pleasant diversion—no one out our
way has learned to twist to it yet.

WGL Party

in formals are just too much, every
now and Lynn.

The difference between Cotil-
lion and a W&L week-end is more
than location. Cotillion is just a
big formal cocktail party that defi-
nitely ends on time, but not in
time to go to the Hollins Inn.

At Cotillion you don’t have to
worry about keeping the combo
filled with Scotch, but you do
have to worry about yourself.

The drink ticket scheme is the
most diabolical plan that I have
ever encountered. For those un-
familiar with the system, your date
buys so many (but not too many,
because there’s a limit) drink
tickets for each night, and you’ve
got to turn them in for booze dur-
ing the half-hour that the bar’s
open. The result of this system
is that everybody rushes to the
bar the minute they get to the
hotel, turns in all his _ tickets,
tries to balance all his drinks for
the rest of the night, and ends up
getting everything spilled on his
shirt at least three times.

Only one guy really beat the
system, and he had his coat poc-
kets lined with plastic so he could
just pour his drinks in, and then
dip them out with a shot glass.

Cotillion is also a good chance
to meet and be polite to boys from
other schools like UVa. Dart-
mouth, VMI, and the like. You’re
always much more polite there
than you are here because you
never know who might set up a
bar in his motel room.

That brings us to the final at-
traction of Cotillion—the motels.
It’s really a delight to get out of
your stuffy Lexington room and
into a Roanoke motel with clean
sheets on the rollaway that you’re
sharing with four other people.
And the innkeepers are so nice.
They all say, “Glad to have you,
hope everything is all right, and
by the way the ice machine is
broken this week-end.”

Meanwhile the Hollins Inn con-
tinues to sell so much beer that
soon they’ll have enough money
to put in a men’s room, and the
University Cleaners is making a
fortune getting stains out tux(s)
(es) (0) (tuxedos). Plastic pocket
liners will go on sale at the co-op
for a dollar three eighty.

LETTERS

EpitroR

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi

I was very much interested in
the item printed in last Friday’s
Ring-tum Phi which discussed cer-
tain professors’ complaints regard-
ing the fact that they “do not have
the time, nor the encouragement, to
pursue their own interests.”

It is hard for me to take this
statement seriously. Many profes-
sors at Washington and Lee do not
properly manage what should be
their primary interest, that of teach-
ing in the classroom. One wonders
how a professor does spend his time,
when he comes to class ten to fif-
teen minutes late and begins by
saying, “Well, gentlemen, what ma-
terial do we have assigned for to-
day?” These men should first con-
duct their classwork properly before
devoting their energies to their “own
interests.”

Several of our professors find time
to conduct excellent classes as well
as to write various reviews, articles,
and books. How do these men find
the extra time that their colleagues
do not? What kind of “encourage-
ment” do these critical professors
need to have before they can prop-
erly pursue their own interests.

The second point of Friday’s ar-
ticle discussed the lack of “intellec-
tual atmosphere” at W&L. I agree
that there is definitely such a lack on
this campus—I think that both facul-
ty and students share the blame for
this situation.

The Washington and Lee student
realizes more of a social atmos-
phere than an intellectual one. A
man is judged by his fraternal affil-
iation rather than by his own indi-
vidual (and intellectual) merits.

The faculty has a great respon-
sibility for this lack of intellectual
atmosphere. If one word could sum
up the feeling or atmosphere of most
classrooms, that word would be:
boredom. While many courses are
not fascinating in every detail, the
professors seem to try to make the
presentation of ideas as unstimulat-
ing as possible. It is hard for a stu-
dent to become interested in a sub-
ject when the professor himself ap-
pears not to be interested in it.

Several members of last years’
freshman class are no longer at W&L
due in part to the fact that they
could not find intellectual satisfac-
tion here. Many students who now
attend W&L at first were eager to
pursue their academic goals, but now
they seek to find a rewarding exist-
ence apart from the academic realm.

I think that there is time avail-
able for professors to pursue their
own interests—as well as time for
proper classroom preparation—and
that if the members of the faculty
wish to help create an “intellectual
atmosphere” at Washington and Lee
they can try to make the class meet-
ing a challenge rather than a drud-
gery.

 

Sincerely,
BRUCE W. RIDER

Grapplers Top Pfeiffer;
Meet F&M Wednesday

Washington and Lee’s wrestling team, boasting consecutive
victories over The University of North Carolina and Pfeiffer
College, will entertain the perenially tough Franklin and Mar-
shall squad in Doremus Gym Saturday night.

 

Freshmen Edge
By Bridgewater

The freshman basketball team
fought off a second half rally by
Bridgewater edging the visitors 54-
52 to win their second game of the
season.

Led by Jerry Kowalski with 20
points, Dick Livingston and George
Madison, Coach Lyles’ Baby Gen-
erals were on top at half-time 31-
25, but needed a layup by Scott
Verner ten seconds before the final
buzzer to clinch the victory.

The first half was characterized
by sloppy ball from both clubs,
but W&L dominated the play and
jumped to the lead.

The Baby Generals place their 2-0
record on the line when they face
Greenbrier this Wednesday.

 

 

The Lexington-Buena Vista
Road Race was won by Bill
Braithwaite, W&L law student,
with a time of 33:23 last Saturday
afternoon.

The six and a quarter mile
course was covered by General
cross-country runner Mike Shank
in 40:24. Shank developed a
leg cramp and was unable to run
all out for most of the race. Fresh-
man harrier Andy Kilpatrick
turned in a time of 39:29.

 

 

* The Diplomats, who beat the Gen-

erals last year 19-9, are especially
strong in the lower weights and
heavyweight classes again this year
according to Coach Dick Miller.

Miller cites F&M’s match Friday
with VMI as a good indication of
how the Generals should fare Sat-
urday.

Yesterday against Pfeiffer the
W&L grapplers came out on top
getting decisions from Butch West,
Dick Albert and Herb Smith and
pins from Co-captain Dave Mont-
gomery and freshman heavyweight
Ken Boiarsky.

The Pfeiffer wrestlers proved
stronger in the middle weights as
W&L’s Mike Brumby (137), Chick
Owens (147), and Sandy Mersereau
(157) lost decisions. Owens dropped
the closest match of the afternoon
bowing to his Pfeiffer opponent
2-0.

The pressure was put on fresh-
man Boiarsky who took the mat
with the score standing at 14-9.

A pin by the Pfeiffer unlimited
would give them a tie in the team
score. The first year grappler dis-
pelled all worry as he flattened his
man giving W&L a 19-9 bulge and
their second win without a loss in
the 1961-62 season.

In the season opener against UNC,
the Blue and White were led by
Herb Smith’s pin and decisions by
West, Montgomery, Tom Stover,
Dick Albert and Co-captain Sandy
Mersereau. The final match score
was 20-6.

Generals Roli Over Bridgewater
ead Late Rally

As Faub

Washington and Lee’s Basketball
team scrambled back from a cold
first half and swamped Bridgewater,
67-49, Monday night for its first vic-
tory of the 1961-62 season.

The Generals dropped their open-
er to Virginia’s Cavaliers, 82-53, last
Friday.

Monday’s victory was a pleas-
ing sight after Friday’s exhibition;
but the win resembled a basket-
ball game for about only the first
ten minutes of the second half
when Rodger “Bip” Fauber, Bill
Ide, and Jon and Tom Supak
spearheaded a W&L rally which
put the Generals ahead to stay.

Led by the Supaks, who gave the
Generals steady play at guard, W&L
raced to a quick 8-2 lead and looked
like it might have a good-old score,
score, score night.

But the scene soon changed as the
Generals grew as cold as an alaskan
night and Bridgewater stormed
ahead.

John Edwards’ free throw with
5:50 left in the half boosted the
Eagles into a 17-16 lead which
they held until just before the
intermission buzzer.

et, Ide L

W&L left the court with a 29-27
halftime lead, but it needed some
fancy shooting by Fauber to get
this cushion.

With one second showing on the
clock, Fauber unleased a_high-
arcing jump shot from the center
circle. Like a guided missile the ball
zoomed through the basket as the
buzzer sounded.

Fauber Sparks Rally
Pesky Edwards tied the score
again to start the second half
with a short jump shot, but captain
Fauber and the Generals were final-
ly off to the races.

 

Fauber sank a lay-up and a free|
throw to give W&L a three-point}

lead.

Then in seven minutes of fast-
break, capitalize-on-your-oppon-
ents-mistakes basketball, the Gen-
erals breezed into a 52-38 lead.

During the rally, Ide contributed
seven points, Fauber collected six
points; Tom Supak got four points;
Jon Supak, two points; and Bill
Smith, one point.

Paterno Shines

Coach Bob McHenry then sent in
the substitutes and a third-string

 

freshman guard—Louis Paterno—
who appeared to be the best player
on the court Monday night—con-
tinued the Generals on their on-
slaught with ten points in the game’s
final seven minutes.

Paterno’s play demonstrated the
first spark of real desire, hustle,
and good aggressive basketball
like the Generals used so much to
their advantage in their upset
over Randolph-Macon and Vir-
ginia last year that has been
shown so far this year.

The Generals placed four men in

EC Voting
Records Will
Be Made Public

Student Questions Sought;
Meetings Now On Mon.

By MALCOLM MORRIS

The executive Committee in its
Tuesday meeting passed a _ prece-
dent-setting resolution which will
make public voting records of its
members in the future.

By a unanimous vote, the EC
provided for a chart showing the
proposals and vote of each of its
members at all regular meetings.
This chart will be published in the
Ring-tum Phi and would replace
any publication of the minutes of
EC meetings.

The EC also resolved by a 9-2
vote to include in this resolution the
clause that the chart shall be pre-
sented openly with specific purport
to press representatives after the
adjournment of each meeting.

 

 

A short question and answer per-
iod will follow for any adamant
criticism or questions presented
from those outside or on the com-
mittee.

Student Body Secretary Steve
Suttle noted that this is the first
time students will know the voting
records of their own represen-
tatives, and that interested stu-
dent, now will have a chance to
question the EC and criticise its
actions before it.

The question and answer period
will correspond to a press confer-
ence with newspaper writers. Suttle
expressed the hope of the EC that
the student body will take advant-
age of the opportunity to become
acquainted with their government.
This step should also reduce criti-
cism of the committee.

In a third motion under the reso-
lution the EC moved its meeting
date from Tuesday to Monday night.
This will allow the actions of the
EC to be publicized in the Rt-P the
next day, whereas in the past
news has been held for 3 days be-
fore being released.

In its next meeting, Monday,
Dec. 12, the EC will make its final
choices of the new Student Con-
trol Committee members. Suttle
reported that an average of 12 ap-
plications were received from
each class, making a total of well
over 40 applicants. These have
been screened by the committee
and reduced to 5 seniors, 3 juniors,
3 sophomores, and 2 law students.

Deans, Faculty On Road;
Visit Secondary Schools

By SHANNON JUNG

Dean of Admission Frank J. Gil-
liam has done extensive traveling
this fall. The purpose of his far-
reaching itinerary is to bring Wash-
ington and Lee to the attention of
college-bound students.

He has had impressive results,
for he said yesterday that the pres-
ent demand for W&L catalogues
indicates that the university is re-
ceiving increased interest and will
receive a record number of appli-
cations this year.

Washington and Lee has founded
as extensive a program of school vis-
itation as its administrative office
permits. Its aim is to reach a reason-
able proportion of schools which
are now sending us a number of
candidates each year.

In addition to this, the administra-
tion tries to add visits to a few
recognized good schools with which
there has not been much. inter-
change.

Dean Gilliam, in order to realize
these aims, has traveled in the New
England area, visiting Exeter, And-
over, St. Paul’s in New Hampshire,
Deerfield, Loomis, and Lawrence-
ville. This year Lawrenceville sent
W&L eight freshmen— the largest
number from any school.

Dean Gilliam’s trip to eastern Vir-
ginia included St. Christopher’s,
Christchurch, and Norfolk Academy
among the private schools. The pub-
lic schools of Norfolk, Newport
News, Warwick, and Hampton par-
ticipated jointly in College Nights at
which the Dean Spoke.

His most recent trip took him to
Cincinnati, Louisville, Memphis, and
St. Louis.

Dean Farrar has also been busy,
having covered the schools in the
Washington area and speaking at
several College Nights in that area.
This week, he has been at Darling-
ton, Indian Springs, Bolles, and
Westminister in Atlanta and public
high schools in Atlanta, Birmingham,

 

‘class. This presages the possibility

and Jacksonville. He has been visit-
ing Woodberry Forest today.

A new program of visitation has
been rather extensively developed
recently—that of having members of
the faculty visit high schools. Among
those members of the faculty par-
ticipating are Borden, Fishwick,
Hamer, Stephenson, Moore, Gunn,
and Rowe.

These programs are proving pro-
ductive, since the present necessity
for conserving catalogues reveals
that the number of applications has
increased with the booming interest
in W&L. The present 1:4 ratio of
candidates for acceptance enrolling
here (319 enrolled from 1252 candi-
dates) may shoot up to 1:6 or 1:7.
Next year there will be approxi-
mately 330 men in the freshman

of having the staggering number
of 2,000 candidates for matriculation.
This means a higher academic stand-
ing resulting from more selective
enrollment. The visitation program
has at least in part caused this im-
provement.

The object of the program is to
inform both high school students and
school officials about W&L. Dean
Gilliam noted an enthusiastic and
happy reaction in these schools over
the article in Sports Illustrated about
the athletic program. More import-
ant that that, Dean Gilliam stated:

“The high regard of W&L held by
every institution visited was most
impressive.”

Each student (except in the Law
School) is required to pick up his
course list for next semester be-
tween 2:00 p.m., Tuesday, Decem-
ber 12, 1961 and 3:30 p.m., Friday,

IFC Approves ’62 FD Proposals;
Zentner To Play Saturday Night

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Si Zentner and his seventeen piece
dance band have been contracted to
entertain the student body during
the Saturday night dance of Fancy
Dress, Dance Board president Steve
Galef announced today.

He also said that the hours for
the dance will be 8:00 until 11:00
and that the required dress will be
conservative suits rather than tuxes.

“Zentner is one of the top trom-
bonists in show business, and has a
solid background of band experience
with such all-time greats as Les
Brown, Harry James and the late
Jimmy Dorsey,” Galef said. He is a
recording artist for Liberty Records
and has considerable experience in
orchestration for films.

 

Galef said that the chief reason
for contracting Zentner is the popu-
larity of his recent recording “Up
a Lazy River,” which is nationally
among the top fifty.

Zentner is a relative newcomer
to the field of dance entertainment,
however. After his initial appearance
on the West Coast, he was contract-
ed to perform at the Roosevelt Ho-
tel. There he was so well received
that his option was extended to in-
clude the period of the Thanksgiv-
ing vacation. His scheduled per-
formance at Washington and Lee
during Fancy Dress will mark his
first professional appearance in the
South with his band.

Usually the Saturday night dance
has been held between the hours of

Jim Hitch and Bill Moore
Attend Conference On US
Military Affairs

Two students from Washington
and Lee are attending the annual
Student Conference on United States
Affairs at the U.S. Military Academy
at West Point this week. Jim Hitch
and Bill Moore are representing
W&L at the conference, which
started Wednesday and ends to-
morrow.

The conference featured an open-
ing address by John J. McCloy for-
mer United States High Commis-
sioner in Germany, who is remem-
bered here for delivering the 1958
Tucker lectures at W&L.

Representatives of about a hun-
dred colleges in the United States
and Canada are attending the four-
day conference, whose theme is the
European community and its impli-
cations for U.S. Policy.

Hitch is a transfer student from
New Mexico Military Institute,
where he was a distinguished mili- |
tary graduate. A dean’s list student
and holder of a Lee Research Schol-
arship, he plans a career in the
regular army upon graduation.

Moore, a Phi Beta Kappa gradu-
ate in history at Sewanee, is a Law
School senior. Presently an appli-
cant for a commisison in the Judge
Advocate’s Department of the U.S.
Navy, he plans to practice law after
graduation, specializing in labor law.

 

Pressing Service

The Student War Memorial
Scholarship Fund Committee will
offer a pressing service to all stu-
dents renting Fancy Dress cos-

Chessmen Meet Roanoke

Washington and Lee’s chess team
dropped a 3-2 match to a Roanoke
team in Roanoke last Friday night.
W&L’s winners were Ronnie Moore,
second board, who defeated Leonard
Morgan, a former Virginia state
champion; and Bill Gray, third
board, who defeated A. C. Abbott of
Roanoke.

The losers for W&L were Lon
Atkins, first board, who lost to Wal-
ter Muir, the nation’s six-ranked
postal player; Franco deBattaglia,
fourth board; and Jack Martin, who
lost to Nelson Bond, Roanoke city
champion for nine years.

 

9 and 12 p.m. Galef explained to
the members of the Dance Board
and the Social Chairmen of the
eighteen fraternities that the re-
scheduling to the new hours was a
faculty concession designed to in-
crease student attendance at the
dance and to enable the fraternities
to hold combo parties that would
not conflict as much as usual with
the school dance.

The decision to require only suits
rather than tuxedos at the Saturday
dance is also designed to increase
attendance at the dance.

Galef reminded the social chair-
men that the faculty has the power
either to do away with the Uni-
versity Dance Weekends or to ban
fraternity parties that would inter-
fere with attendance at the school
functions.

Three resolutions were then passed
by the chairmen with unanimous
votes. The resolutions are: (1) No
further contracts will be made con-
cerning Fancy Dress combos on
Saturday afternoon between the
hours of 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. (2) Fra-
ternities will not start combos on
Fancy Dress Weekend 1962 before
9:30 p.m.. (3) Fraternities are aware
of the problems that exist and are
willing to work for a compromise
to solve these problems.

The chairmen are returning to the
houses to discuss these problems
and solutions.

Auditions For
‘Othello’ Held

The final session of auditions for
the Troubadour Theatre’s production
of Shakespeare’s Othello will take
place at the Troub Theatre tonight
from 7:30 to 9 p.m. Readings are
open to all students whether they
have acted here previously or not.

 

Anyone who wishes to try for a
role but is unable to attend the
scheduled auditions may contact Dr.
Cecil Jones, Troubadour director,
and arrange for a private reading
over the wekend.

There are twenty-two male roles
in the acting version of the tragedy
as it will be presented. Seventeen of
these are speaking roles. Dr. Jones
noted that several of these are small
parts requiring only a_ limited
amount of rehearsal.

Full rehearsals for Othello will not
get underway until the start of the
second semester. The cast is being
selected at this time, however, in
order to allow those persons who
will play the six major roles to
have individual coaching on their
parts prior to the beginning of their
work with the rest of the company.
Dr. Jones emphasized that no work
on the show would conflict in any
way with a student’s work at the
end of this semester.

 

Dr. Louis B. Wright Discusses The Bard

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Last night Dr. Louis B. Wright,
a noted scholar in the related fields
of English and history, spoke at 8:15
in Lee Chapel on “Shakespeare for
the Layman.”

The director of the Folger Shake-
speare Library in Washington, Dr.
Wright was introduced by Dr. Fitz-
gerald Flournoy as “a citizen of
the world.”

“What he hasn’t written, he has
edited,” said Dr. Flournoy,

Dr. Wright was instrumental in the
deciphering and publication of the
private diary of William Byrd; and
he later accounted for the “sudden”
flowering of political and military
leadership in Virginia during the
period of the American Revolution

in his book The First Virginia
Gentlemen.
One of his most popular edited
works is The General Reader’s
Shakespeare.

“Shakespeare is not just a person
who is a favorite of professors,”
said Dr. Wright in his introductory
remarks. “Indeed, I am constantly
amazed at the interest the layman
has in Shakespeare.” He then told
of his amusing experience in a
crowded theater in London. He had

 

bought the very last ticket available
for a performance of Love’s Labors’
Lost and was seated next to a wage
earner in the five penny section. At
one point in the play ,the man
nudged him and chuckled, “That’s a
good un!”

Seventy-four Translations

Dr. Wright first mentioned Shake-
spear’s lasting and widespread popu-
larity. “Only the Bible,” he said, “is
available in more languages than
Shakespeare.” Shakespeare is read
in seventy-four languages and his
plays appear on the stages and in
the movies of many nations. “On
both sides of the Iron Curtain,
Shakespeare apparently has admir-
ers; he is one writer who seems to
be above the issues of politics.”

In discussing Shakespeare’s uni-
versal appeal, Dr. Wright mentioned
the case of one lady “who wrote a
pamphlet on ‘Shakespeare’s Crows,
because she liked crows and found
them mentioned in the plays.”

The anti-Shakespeare movement |
has attempted to bastardize the bard |
by assigning his works to the pen
of such miscellaneous people as
Marlowe, the Earl of Hartford, a|

syndicate headed by Ben Johnson, !

 

Bacon, or even Queen Elizabeth. |
But to date they have produced no!

® : : |
scrop of reliable evidence to disprove |

Shakespeare's authorship, and have |
only succeeded in proving his popu- |
larity.

Dr. Wright remarked that “it has |
been estimated that one fifth of the |
people in British lunatic asylums |
have delusions about the validity |
of Shakespeare.”

“Conspiracy of Schoolteachers” |

The reasons for Shakespeare’s |
popularity are varied. Some main-|
tain that he is kept alive by a “con-|
spiracy of schoolteachers.” Perhaps
Dr. Wright suggested, “he has sur-

vived in spite of scholars.” Shakes-
peare did not write for a congnos-
centi, or small, selected group, but
for everyman. He wrote “with an

eye to the box office.” He sought to
interest as many as he could, so
they would attend the performance
of his company. He wrote with
genius on themes of universal in-
terest and importance.

His genius is manifested in his
close observation of the world, his
transmutation of words into beauty |
his sympathic understanding of hu-
man nature, and his instinctive eapa-
city to seek the elements for his!

| perienced and what we

plays where he could best get them:
in full experience in life and in
conversation with his fellows.

“His powers of assimilation were
enormous, and this capacity was evi-
dence of genius, not of booklearn-
ing,” continue Dr. Wright. “His char-
acters seem to live and breath as
men and women; he gives them life.
The appeal of Shakespeare is to our
humanity; and it is universal, inde-
pendent of time and space, for he
expresses both what we have ex-
know we
could experience.

 

“No translation, however good,

can capture the music and evocative |

power of Shakespeare; hence he has |

a powerful appeal to the English |
speaking world which cannot be|
readily comprehended by others.
“Shakespeare writes with ease and
grace; he uses simple words and}
never twists them to fit a rhyme or |
meter; his figures are from life, not
the classics. There is nothing artifi-

cial or contrived about Shakespeare.”

Through his works “we receive
instruction and experience delight;
and this combination is the highest
achievement of any writer.” |

Dr. Wright and Dr. Flournoy discuss Shakespeare.

A Word On Athletes

We understand that the basketball team and some mem-
bers of the coaching staff are unhappy about Steve Henry’s
article in last Friday’s R-tP. We would like to be able to tell
them to take some justly deserved criticism like the men they
think they are. But we can’t because we are afraid that they
are guilty of a tragic misconception which is prevalent through-

out the United States.

Somehow the American sportwriters have convinced the
public that athletes are a breed apart, some race that is superior
to non-athletes in every respect. They are not, they are men

just like all men.

Some athletes are very intelligent, but some are very stupid.
Some are very good athletes, but some are no good at all. Some
take bribes. Others cheat (as we at W&L know to our sorrow).
Some play harder than others. Some are gentlemen, many are

not.

We don’t know why the basketball team thinks they are
above criticism. They loaf sometimes. They make mistakes
often. They also play very well at times. We think it is the
responsibility of the Ring-tum Phi to tell its readers what the
truth is, to the best of our ability. Steve Henry is not a great
sports writer. But he is a sports writer who is not afraid to say
what he thinks. He will continue to say what he thinks and the
Ring-tum Phi will continue to print what he thinks.

Fancy Dress Trial

The announcement today of the band for Saturday night
of Fancy Dress completes the Dance Board’s booking for the
big weekend. Steve Galef and Frank Young have worked very
hard to give the student body the best entertainers they can

get for the dance weekends.

This Fancy Dress should be among the best of recent
years. We will be curious to see the sort of attendance the big
dances will have. If attendance is poor, it should convince the
powers-that-be that the present formula for dance weekends
needs changing, to give dance plan subscribers their money’s

worth.

 

PROTEST ‘Soap Operas’ Reveal

Need For Honor

By HOWARD SLATER

How is the term “honor” applied,
within the framework of the honor
system?

This is the vital question which
still plagues us; because contrary to
the belief of many, Dr. Coulling’s
recent article on the honor system
did not solve the problem, or even
try to. What it did was create a
more conscious appreciation of why
we ought to have such a system,
and it also stated what “honor” is,
what it includes, and what limits
there are to the exactness of this
description.

But when Dr. Coulling used the
term “application,” he was referring
only to “the area covered by the
honor system.” This really is a part
of his definition of honor. The actual
application of the honor system is
the enforcement of a code of honor,
and the punishment of trangessions
on this code.

If we accept Dr. Coulling’s defini-
tion of honor—and everyone seems
to be more or less agreed that it
is the best definition we can expect—
we are then, nevertheless, still con-
fronted by the need to apply this
definition in the framework of a
functioning honor system. How is
the code of honor enforced? More
important, how are trangressions on
this code punished?

Past Answer Unsatisfactory

The answer that has been given
in the past—the answer, that is
which has been implied by the actual
practices of the system—has been
that any violation of the honor sys-
tem requires the violator’s expul-
sion from school.

This ought to be an unsatisfactory
answer for anyone who wants to
claim sensitivity and humanity as
part of his personal attributes. By
dismissing as soap operas the case
histories of past expellees which
Protest has been printing recently,
we ignore a very real poignancy in
these examples, a poignancy which
has meaning for us all. If nothing
else, it is clear that a selfish identi-
fication can establish a relation be-
tween us and those “guilty” ones.

These are, after all, human beings,
with feelings like our own—and with
aspirations and ambitions, similar
to ours, whose achievement now are
impossibly or tragically altered by
the workings of the honor system.

The point, of course, is that we
cannot abstract the human ele-
ment out of the honor system.
This element both operates and
is operated on by the system.
When we start to make the funda-

 

System Leniency

mental distinction between honest
and dishonest men, we cannot fail
to remember that we are still
dealing with men. Thus, the pro-
cess of the honor system is weight-
ed by the gravity of its repercus-
sions,
Leniency Needed

In this dilemma, the inevitable
conclusion is for us to prefer that
the honor system be lenient in pun-
ishing trangessions. It would be far
better if ten men who cheated on
exams got away with it, than if
one who didn’t cheat were mistaken-
ly expelled from school.

The practical solution to this pref-
erence for leniency would be recog-
nition that there are differing de-
grees of guilt. A man may be guilty
of violating the code of honor, but
he may be less guilty than he could
have been. Like Dr. Coulling, I do
not feel semantically naive when I
say it is difficult to define exactly
what is meant by “degrees of guilt”
in the honor system. Conditions and
requirements make it difficult to give
examples. But the lack of sinister
intent would make a man “less
guilty’—although it can be argued
that the logical conclusion for this
is that there can be no guilt at all,
unless there is the intent to be dis-
honest.

In the end, the burden of the
gravity of the honor system, and the
problem of balancing leniency with
punishment, both fall on the mem-
bers of the Executive Committee.
They must apply the code of honor.

Opposing Argument

The only argument of any valid-
ity that can be opposed to the
existence of an honor system is
that those who administer it are
only students, who tend to bend
over backwards and be too harsh
in their judgments. That this is
the best argument against an hon-
or system is testimony to how
fine a thing the honor system is.

For as the harshness of the judi-
cial group lessens, so too does the
strength of the criticism lessen.

By STEVE HENRY

In the Spring of 1961, an event
of considerable significance took
place on the Washington and Lee
campus when the first issue of the
student literary magazine PROBES
was placed on sale.

PROBES, a magazine for the stu-
dents, containing short stories, crit-
ical essays, and poetry by the stu-
dents, was the brainchild of a
thoughtful Phi Beta Kappa named
Tony Gray, who was also the pro-
genitor of the  once-formidable
weekly journal Protest.

Gray, an admittedly angry, angry
young man, who often took out his
anger on Washington and Lee, cre-
ated PROBES because “any school,
even W&L, needs a student literary
magazine.”

To Gray, the idea of Washington
and Lee not having such a publica-
tion was ridiculously in keeping
with other anti-intellectual charac-
teristics of the school (which, we
might add, are coming more to the
front each day.)

Response to the first issue of
Probes was good enough to show
Gray that a student literary outlet
was not only needed, but also
wanted by the student body.

This, of course, came as no sur-
prise to Gray, who knew all the
time that even a uninspired student
body like we have here has oc-
casional twinges of literary creativ-
ity.

As everybody knows, boys will be
boys, and students will write, pro-
vided that there’s a chance for pub-
lication in a magazine of any size,
shape or description.

PROBES opened the door to any-
body who was willing to take time
to write, and it was about time.

Lack of Encouragement

For years, Washington and Lee
was one of the few “prestige”(?)
schools in America that provided no
encouragement for its student body’s
potential writers.

When was the last time you ever
heard of a prominent author (or
critic, or anything) who picked up
his sheepskin at good old W&L?
Think hard now.

While neighboring schools like
Randolph-Macon, Sweet Briar, Hol-
lins, and even William and Mary
were turning out readable student
publications, W&L was concentrat-
ing on the development of its most
prominent publication Shenandoah.

We are happy that the Shenandoah
is a first class magazine. Some ex-
ceptionally fine work has appeared
in its pages, and by some of the
most prominent authors in America.

However, with the exception of an
occasional student contribution,
Shenandoah does nothing for the
Washington and Lee student body.
Whether this is good or bad is an-

PROBES Closes Breach
In Campus Literary Life

What we are saying is that, until
the advent of PROBES, a young
writer at W&L wrote for his own
benefit and for nothing else, which
is hardly encouraging.

But why rant and rave over a
problem that’s been solved? There
are plenty of other things around
here to gripe about. (Just check out
Protest if you don’t believe us.)

Anyway, PROBES is here, and it
is a good thing for everybody.

Alenstein

Gray, who took his diploma and
left Washington and Lee last year
(presumably forever), turned over
the reins of PROBES to Ron Alen-
stein, a ZBT senior who will edit
both of the proposed issues of the
magazine this year.

Alenstein, who won a 1961 junior
Mahan award for creative writing,
is presently collecting manuscripts
for the first issue of PROBES, sched-
uled for a late January release.

Contributions thus far have been
gratifying. A generous supply of
fiction is on hand already, along
with a few poems of publishable
quality. Critical work, however, is
lacking.

Alenstein says that this year’s
PROBES will contain some 35-40
pages, including several pages de-
voted to art work which will ac-

Deadline for submitting manu-
scripts is December 15.

essays,” says Alenstein, who spends

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Time in the contemporary novel
is not what it once was.

Ulysses, the lengthy novel by
James Joyce, covers the occurences
of the day. Another Joycean tale,
Finnegan’s Wake, begins and ends on
the same night.

What is the attempt of authors
to get outside of the conventional
application of time in fiction writing?
When and how did it begin?

According to Douglas Day, English
instructor at W&L, the Joycean
technique had its beginnings in the
18th century. In the 19th, English
and French writers came to be more

 

interested in the dramatic technique
than in the panoramic technique of
novel writing. The panoramic tech-
nique, Mr. Day said, can be com-
pared to an organism.

“The panoramic author paints a
picture. He begins at a specific point
in time, and carries his characters
through an orderly progression of
time. For instance, he will begin
with a central character in his youth |
and bring him to old age.

“The dramatic technique, on the
other hand, deals with the psycho-
logical complexities of characters.
The novel with the dramatic tech-
nique becomes more subtle, and time
is knocked out of the picture.”

Tristram Shandy a First

The first novel, according to Day,
to get outside of time was Lawrence
Sterne’s Tristram Shandy in 1851.
“This novel has no conventional
narrative sequence and has some-
thing which strangely resembles the
stream of consciousness technique.”

He said stream of consciousness
writing is “the attempt of the au-
thor to climb into our minds and
see reality as viewed from within.”

Mr. Day said that a novel cannot
be strictly chronological if it is to
be realistic, “because we don’t know
people chronologically.”

“To see a person truly and real-
istically, you have to see him from
a number of viewpoints and places
in time. To be really realistic, then,
the novel must get outside of time.

“Until relatively recently, time
was an aggregation—it was some-
thing accumulated, layered. It is one
of our stereotypes that we think of
time as neatly divided into the past,
the present, and the future.

“Modern philosophers would say
that this really isn’t the only way
to look at time,” Mr. Day said.

“Time, according to them, is a con-
tinuum. It has no beginning, no end,
and no middle. It is not just in a
straight line, but has body and more
than one dimension.”

“Time Is Relative”

“Time is relative, and it is a func-
tion of personality,” Mr. Day pointed
out. He said that “when we are ex-
cited, time passes fast, when we are
bored, it passes slowly.”

He insisted that “a minute is not
60 seconds long—it is as long as you
perceive it to be.”

What is the novelist attempting
to do besides be more realistic when
he gets outside of time?

 

A former R-T P ERITOR has
said that, ten years ago, the Board
of Trustees would not have both-
ered to comment on an incident
such as the recent Martin Luther
King episode. The fact that the
Board chose to recognize student
and faculty dissent marks a definite
change in attitude, he says.

The occasion for his comment was
a statement on the King decision by
University Rector James Caskie, of
Lynchburg.

STEVE HENRY’S ARTICLE in
last Friday’s Ring-tum Phi on
W&L’s basketball program aroused
varied comment among the members
of the Athletic Department. One
coach was heard to say that “Henry
is just bitter because he didn’t get
to play much on the freshman
basketball team.”

Another said: “Sure, most of it’s
true. But he didn’t have to say it.”

STEVE GALEF is working out de-
tails for a folk music festival on
the week-end of Spring Dances.
Tentative plans call for inviting up-
and-coming student groups from
northern and eastern universities.
The Dance Board would pay trans-
portation, and offer a_ substantial
cash prize to the most promising
group.

The contest would be judged by
a well-known artist, such as Theo-
dore Bikel, and by audience reaction.
It is thought that the event would
pay for itself.

Problem In Literature: Transcending Time

Mr. Day said that the novelist “is
trying basically to look at existence
in a different way, He is trying to
tell a story in a way it has not been
told before.”

“Novelists, in trying to present
time differently, range from the
complexities involved in a method
like the stream of consciousness
technique to the simple flashback
employed in the movies,” Mr. Day

“James, and after him Joseph
Conrad and Ford Madox Ford, used
various mechanisms to get out of
presenting time conventionally.

“In very recent years, in this
century, James Joyce came to the

Joyce’s last novel, occurred at night

LETTERS

TQ THE 4

The recent exchanges between

two of the campus publications serv-
es to validate what is known as
Jenkinson’s law; that is, “everybody’s
crazy.” I find it amusing that the
Ring-tum Phi and Protest, both
supposedly dedicated to serving
their readers, should waste valuable
space and energy throwing verbal
brick-bats.

Many things are subtle in this
life, says the Prophet; one of the
best teachings on this point comes
from an old Pennsylvania Dutch
custom brought to light by the musi-
cal “Plain and Fancy.” When a mem-
ber of the community was in dis-
favor the other citizens simply re-
fused to acknowledge his presence
by “shunning” him.

The two publications by devot-
ing space and energy to each other
have lessened their stature, or so
it seems to me. The official Campus
Voice certainly strengthens the
other’s cause by taking great issue
with it. Nor is Protest furthering its
interests, for by retorting it only
serves to underscore its own ap-
parent shaky mental attitudes. But
its actions do more than this, it
sets itself up in the reader’s mind
as only a negative critical outlet
rather than the positive force it
proports to be.

Everybody’s crazy. No other rule
seems quite applicable; for to take
each other so seriously remains
only a source of amusement.

they are favored to win not only
their league, but also the whole
school championship, which won’t
be decided until almost March.
With all five starters returning
from last year’s team that won the
runner-up honors behind the Cham-

terial this year to go all the way.

Wednesday
In one of the wildest I-M games in
recent years, the Independents

scored a 41-40 win over the SAE’s
Wednesday.

Phi Psi won an overtime game
from the PiKA’s on the same night,
and established itself as a favorite in
its league.

On Thursday evening Kappa Sig-
ma took the court against SPE and
won by a 56-36 margin as Lance
Tarrance scored 17 points.

After getting off to a slow start, the
cagers from ZBT hit for ten consecu-
tive points as they defeated Lambda
Chi, 37-23. High scorer for the win-
ners was sophomore Billy Solomon,
who hit on an assortment of out-
side shots for seven field goals.
Freshman Art Sher also stood out
as he contributed nine points.

In the contest between Phi Psi
and PiKA, Phi Psi rallied in the
closing seconds of regulation play
to tie the score at 34 all. In the
first overtime period Chuck Lane
hit on a jump shot and a charity
toss to put the game out of reach
of the Pi KA’s. The final score was
38-35.

Bowling

In I-M bowling ZBT outclassed
Phi Ep as they won all three games
by large margins. Freshman Vic
Galef paced the winners as he posted
the highest three game score this
year, 650. His individual totals were
226, 222, and 202. After two matches
his 203 average is the best in the
league.

On Tuesday night Sigma Chi, KA
and Lambda Chi all won their con-
tests at the Lexington Bowling Al-
lies. Sigma Chi downed the repre-
sentatives from Phi Psi 3-1. Jon
Montague compiled a 487 total for
the evening.

In the KA-Phi Gam encounter,

torious as they defeated their win-

Baby Generals
Post 3rd Win,
81-69 Over GMS

Five men hit for double figures
as the Washington and Lee fresh-
man basketball team posted its third
straight win, 81-69 over Greenbrier
Military Academy Wednesday night.

 

Forward Dick Livingston paced |
the Baby Generals with 24 points, |
despite the fact that he played only |

half the game because of early
foul trouble.
Jerry Kowalski, with 10, Scotty

Varney, with 14, George Madison
with 12, and Jay Girard, with 11,
also landed in double figures for
coach Joe Lyles’ charges.

Lyles called the Greenbrier win
“our best effort of the year.”

I propose this startling question: what is the toughest sport
at W&L? Football? Wrestling? Hell, no! It’s intramural
basketball! This great American sport, formerly a game of pre-
cision and non-contact, has been radically converted at W&L
into a blood and guts game, where anything goes and the cardi-
nal rule is hit or get hit.

At le ast in 1 varsity football, a player has protection from

Bridgewater.
Kowalski, Livingston, and Madi- |

son have scored in double figures |

Two Victories

The Washington and Lee varsity
swimming team jumped off to a
good start this week by dropping
| both Roanoke College and the Uni-
versity of Virginia in two dual meets.

Against Roanoke, W&L’s
;men captured first place in all
events except three, with team cap-
tain Elliott Maynard continuing his
record-breaking performances of
last year in establishing a new rec-
ord in the 200-yard individual med-
ley.

His time was 2:20.

That would be too decent, too fair,

and too much to expect from the
officials. God bless their souls, those
officials! I-M rules apparently call
for the most uninformed, unintel-

can be mustered from the ranks of
the student body.

Add to these chosen officials a
metal object, called a whistle, and
then place two opposing teams de-
termined to fight and die for the
house on the court, and suddenly
you have a scene comparable to the
jungle wars in the Congo.

Bones crack, tempers flare, elbows
fly, players crash to the floor, and
in the meantime one referee checks
how much time there is left in the
game, and the other smiles, check-
ing nothing, trying only to avoid

the fun. It’s almost as funny as
the varsity.

Why has this been allowed to hap-
pen? There is one main reason for
the lack of competent officiating.

This year the I-M directors have
deemed it necessary to keep people
from officiating who are affiliated
with any I-M basketball team. In
other words, a member of a partici-
pating team could not referee any

I-M games, not even in another
league.
This logically leads to exactly

what has happened: an almost total
lack of good officials. Let’s face it.
Just about anybody who knows any-
thing about the game is going to be
playing for his respective frater-
nity, or for the law school, or for
the Independent team. This leaves
a meager handful of people from
whom to choose referees.

This is the reason that referees
show up for the I-M games who do
not know the rules, who are unable
to keep order on the court, who let
the players call the shots, and who
are generally incompetent.

Basketball is perhaps the most
popular I-M sport. It’s ridiculous
that the officiating is poor. It costs
everybody involved, including the
I-M department, which actually pays
money for the farce.

Also on Tuesday, December 5,

wrestling as it easily downed the
grapplers from Pi Phi 25-10. After
forfeiting in in the 130 lb. class, Phi
Gam received 25 straight points as

matches by pins.

In the match between DU and

out a 21-15 victory. With the score
tied at 15 all, Charles Dennis out-
lasted his opponent in the 177-pound

Forty Per Cent of Alumni

Approximately 40 per cent of some

weeks.

Figures show that 4,360 persons
have filled out a special question-
naire designed to obtain information
for the start of an alumni occupa-
tional file at the university. The
Alumni Association mailed 10,966

Freshman guard Louis Paterno,
who scored 10 points in the second

tion.

Errors

McHenry said his squad will have
to correct the sloppy ball-handling
it displayed against Bridgewater,
especially against presses of both the
half court and full court variety.

Bridgewater’s full court press
during the first half of last Mon-
day’s game visibly shook the Gen-
erals, who made repeated ball con-
trol errors, resulting in easy baskets
for the Eagles.

In the second half, however, cap-
tain Bip Fauber and senior forward
Bill Ide sparked the Generals into
a 20-point lead that turned the game
into a runaway.

“We've got to watch our charging
fouls, too,” said McHenry. “We need
a lot more finesse out there.”

W&L’s next game is against Emory
and Henry away next Monday.

 

Harrington Interviews Mr. Day:

Is Time Theme A Blind Alley?

(Continued from page 2)
followers of Joyce, Dorothy Rich-
ardson, Virginia Wolfe, and Faulk-
ner in The Sound and the Fury all
use stream of consciousness.

A Blind Alley

What is the present status of time
in literature? Day believes that
stream of consciousness “seems to
have reached a blind alley.

“You cannot take fiction writ-
ing any more into chaos than by
going into the mind of a sub-
conscious man. In order to com-
municate, which is one of the pur-
poses of the novel, there must be
some order.”

 

Professor Day described the pres-
ent trend in France away from sub-|
jective techniques in fiction writing.
He said the trend there is to des-|
cribe only events in novel writing.
No symbolism or subjectivity at all
is used.

“Since we often follow France's)
literary example, there is a_possi-
bility that the trend will develop in,
this country.” |

He added, however, that “fiction |
and literature aren’t historical. You
can’t say what will happen.”

“My guess would be a return to/
something like conventional fiction,
perhaps a kind of reversion to writ- |
ing like that of past novelists.”

What about time in the new fic-
tion writing age, whatever it will
be?

Bake ie

 

 

 

SUN.-MON.-TUES.

 

 

 

 

Professor Day doesn’t believe that
stream of consciousness will be for-
gotten. It will have left its mark on
the literature of the ages.

“Time will be important to the
new novelists. It will probably be
approached differently, but it will
refiect the Joycean technique’s use
of time.”

ing to decide how the Winter issue
will look and what it will contain.

As editor-in-chief, it is his deci-
sion that tells the tale on whether
or not a manuscript makes the pages
of PROBES, or whether it goes back
to the author as a reject.

 

“We haven’t had a chance to do}
much rejecting,” he says. “We really |
need as many contributions as we
can possibly get in order to make
PROBES a good magazine. The more
manuscripts we get, the better range
of material the magazine ean have.”

Like all editors of campus publi-
cations, Alenstein’s biggest problem
is getting the best material that the

Subscriptions

With two issues of PROBES on|

and business manager Jerry Dattle

scriptions to the magazine.

Like everything and everybody) dent body is going to have to sup

in the world, PROBES needs money
in order to make ends meet. Sub-
scriptions would be one way of get-

has depended mainly on donations
and the funds raised by the sales of
PROBES last year to finance the ini-
tial issue this year.

So it’s easy to see that the stu-

port PROBES if the magazine is t

“I know there are people in the!

times they just won't contribute any- |
thing. I don’t know exactly why. |
It’s a good opportunity to see how |
your work looks in printed form.”
Alenstein emphasized the fact that
PROBES holds no copyright or any-
thing of the sort on its material.

Honor System
Needs Thought

(Continued from page 2)

Members of the Executive Com-
mittee have admitted that this year
the EC is a more lenient group than
it has been in the past. If this is
true, then probably it is a result of
increased student concern with the
honor system. In any case, it should
be a welcome development to all,
even if only from that selfish point of
view—-because the life one saves

 

may be one’s own.

Omicron Delta Kappa honored the seventeen outstanding
campus leaders today in the Forty-Seventh Annual Tap Day

Ceremony.

One faculty member and three alumni were also tapped at

the yearly event.

Speaking at the noon-hour convocation was Dr. Joseph C.
Robert, Professor of History at the University of Richmond
and former president of Hampden-Sydney College.

Dr. Robert, brother-in-law of Washington and Lee Chan-

cellor Francis P. Gaines, spoke

ship in the Southern tradition.

Without denying the shortcomings
of the Old South, and specifically
rejecting any “curtain of white
columns” to check free interplay of
ideas and information, Dr. Robert
urged the students to draw from
the experiences of the South and
the idess of responsible leadership.
He indicated that if Virginia had
followed the spirit of liberalism
and accommodation present in Rock-
bridge County perhaps there would
have been no Civil War.

In the course of his remarks he
reviewed the grand and extensive
academic tradition to which they
were heirs. Dr. Robert especially

x emphasized the distinctive quality of
the liberal arts in an independent
institution, the spirit of which spills
over into the professional schools.
As to the world outlook he rejected
the idea of inevitable decline, see-
ing in the new leadership reasons
for hope.

Omicron Delta Kappa, with chap-
ters at most of the leading univer-
sities and colleges of the nation.
was founded at Washington and Lee
in 1914 as an honorary leadership
fraternity.

Success, Not Age, Gives W&L Traditions Their Value

Editor’s note: The following article
was was written for the Tuesday Edition
by a man who has long been a true
friend of Washington and Lee. Dr. L. J.
Desha, who is both a graduate and Pro-
fessor of Chemistry here, has kindly
consented to write an article on the “Tra-
ditions of Washington and Lee.” We feel
that Dr. Desha’s observations and com-
ments are, indeed, worthy of considera-
tion by the Student Body.

By DR. L. J. DESHA
Professor of Chemistry
Mr. Robert R. Goodwin, II
Editor
The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Dear Mr. Goodwin,

Thank you for your recent invitation
to contribute an article on the “Tradi-
tions of Washington and Lee.” I under-
stand that it is your purpose to publish
a series of reviews continuing what Pro-
fessor Coulling began so very ably in his

Che King-tum Phi

discussion of the Honor System. This is
a purpose to which any loyal alumnus
would be glad to contribute to the ex-
tent of his capacity.

Doubtless your choice fell on me as one
who appears to have been a part of
Washington and Lee, as student and pro-
fessor, for a longer span than anyone else
now living. As such, you probably count-
ed upon receiving some history of the
origins and development of these tra-
ditions.

Here, however, I must fail you; for,
when I first stepped upon campus, in
September 1903, I found the same
Honor System, the same habit of con-
ventional dress, and the same “speaking”
tradition which are here today. Perhaps
that statement of fact—“eye-witness” tes-
timony, if you will—is, in itself, of no
mean significance.

If, leaving now this period of per-
sonal observation, I may speculate
upon the origins of these traditions in

a more distant past I would state a
very difinite conviction. This is that
they all evolved—let us stress the
word evolved, for certainly, none of
them could have sprung up full
fledged, over night—it is my convic-
tion that all of our traditions evolved
from the fundamental concept that
Washington and Lee men are gentle-
men.

Gentlemen do not cheat, they do not lie,
they do not steal—hence, the Honor Sys-
tem. Gentlemen have pride of person;
they realize that they owe it to them-
selves even more than to others to be
personally clean, well groomed, present-
able—thus conventional dress. Gentlemen
are polite; they are considerate not only
of the rights but the feelings of others;
fellow members of an association of
gentlemen speak when they meet.

Naturally I have seen many changes
over the past nearly sixty years but all
these are superficial, non-essential. The

quadrupling of the student body over the
300 of my freshman year has called for
minor differences in the administrative
procedures of the Honor System; funda-
mentally, it remains what it was when
I sat on a student jury in old Tucker
Hall when an accused had demanded a
public trial.

The “conventional” dress of 1903, if
reproduced now, would be as uncon-
ventional as are the brass head lamps
of a 1903 Olds. As to speaking I am
not sure that in that earlier day we
had learned to say, “Hi, gentlemen”;
certainly, “Hello” was not so preva-
lent then, when one could—and usu-
ally did—greet a fellow student by his
name or, more probably, nick name.
Again, the differences are among in-
essentials; the fundamentals of good
manners are dateless, however they
may vary.

Let no one mistake me to hold that

anything is worth while merely be-
cause it is old. The value for the
Washington and Lee traditions lie not
in their age but in the fact that they
have worked—and still work. Living as
gentlemen has made this campus a pleas-
ant and satisfying place in which to spend
four years of development for life.

It has done much to produce the re-
spect and regard which Washington and
Lee alumni customarily command in their
communities. Less important, but certain-
ly not to be despised, it has produced a
campus atmosphere which wins the praise
of countless visitors.

And who can doubt but that the ob-
servance of these traditions is weightily
responsible for the nation-wide recog-
nition of Washington and Lee as a “pres-
tige” institution?

Thank you again, Mr. Editor, for your
invitation to express these ideas.

Sincerely yours,
L. J. DESHA, ’06

A Refreshing Attitude

From Executive Committee

It is encouraging to see that Washington and Lee’s Execu-
tive Committee is cognizant of the importance of strong re-
lations with both the campus media and with the Student Body
as a whole.

By voting to provide a chart showing the proposals and the
vote of each of the EC members, the Executive Committee has
realized that it owes to the students who elected them to office
an active reporting of their government’s actions.

 

In their meeting held last Tuesday night, the Executive
Committee voted also to give press representatives a chance to
question members as to certain proposals under study by the
Student governmental leaders.

Their vote to hold meetings on Mondays in order to utilize
both of the editions of the Ring-tum Phi is also an encouraging
step in the line of better government for the Student Body.
As was pointed out in Friday’s paper, their meeting on Mondays
will allow the Ring-tum Phi to report results of the Executive
Committee the next day. Heretofore, this year, there existed
a three-day lapse between the meetings and the newspapers’
reporting of those meetings.

The Tuesday Edition wishes to go on record as hailing
these steps taken by the EC as moves which will benefit the
Executive Committee in the fulfillment of its obligations to the

Student Body.

A Promising Enthusiasm

Now that the bands and musicians have all been contracted
for this year’s Fancy Dress Weekend, the next step would seem
to lie in student support of the Dance Board’s work.

The social chairmen of the 18 fraternities, we are happy to
report, have agreed to support the Dance Board’s actions by
limiting the times that combos will start at the houses. It is also
encouraging to note that the group which Steve Galef called
together passed a resolution which states the “fraternities are
aware of the problems that exist and are willing to work for a
compromise to solve these problems.”’

From the way that the sale of costumes has been going, we
think this, in itself, is indicative of student support for the
dance weekend.

The Ball, which is to be held in the Commons, should
prove, indeed, to be the year’s biggest event socially.

It is also our understanding that the Dance Board Advisory
Council is working according to plans, and we can note that this,
too, seems encouraging.

Perhaps, with a little luck, Fancy Dress this year really will
be the ‘‘South’s outstanding college social event.” We hope
so, at any rate.

A New Responsibility

With the announcement in last night’s EC meeting of the
appointment of 5 men to the newly organized Student Control
Committee, we feel that a new era in student responsibility has
been ushered into Washington and Lee life.

These men, each of whom will have to assume a great deal
of responsibility themselves, are well-qualified and are students
who would seem to have the best interests of Washington and
Lee at heart.

The selection of these members, however, is not the last
step to be taken. Student support and student respect will be a
prerequisite to the Committee’s success, and we hope that
the Student Body realizes this basic assumption.

As we said earlier this year, the faculty has placed a tre-
mendous amount of trust in student hands by their giving
support to this Committee. Again, we urge the students not to
betray this trust and this responsibility.

 

ODK speaker, Dr. J. C. Robert told the student body today
of the Southern tradition of leadership at the ODK Assembly.

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

Since there are still nine shop-
ping days left until the last shop-
ping day before
Christmas, it’s
really not time to
start discussing
Christmas present
buying. But since
this is my last
column before the
holidays, and also
since I’ve just got-

 

ten my annual

“ Christmas club
Craven check from the
TB Society of
Lexington-Buena Vista, it seems

that it might be appropriate to dis-
cuss this sort of thing right now.

But, my family subscribes to the
Ring-tum Phi (although they seldom
get it), and I don’t want to let any
cats out of any bags. So I’m going
to turn my attention to what I feel
is one of the greatest problems of
this University.

I'm doing this now so everybody
will do what they can in the next
few days, and then return in the
new year determined to correct the
situation as it now stands. The situa-
tion I refer to is the definite lack
and continuing decline in partici-
pation in non-collegiate extra-cur-
ricular activity.

Being in the Class of 1962, which
is the very last of the un-Commons
classes, I have been a witness to the
slow death of several venerable
Lexington institutions. These insti-
tutions are by no means dead, but
if something isn’t done by the non-
serious before the year is out then
next year the only support they re-
ceive will be from five-year men and
law students.

I’m referring, of course, to the
theatres of the town. Some of you,
especially freshmen, are unaware

that the town has two such places
of business, and I’m positive there
are some that don’t know there is
even one. I’ve tried, Mr. Side and
Mr. Daves can testify to that, to get
you guys going to the fiicks, but
every day it seems like only the
dozen or so regulars, and two old
ladies, are there. I understand that
a lot of people use the afternoons
as nap time—but this does not ex-
cuse you from going to the movies.
Sack from 4 to 6 is much better after
a bad movie, or even a good one like

 

“T Women From Hell.” So get out
there, men, to the movies; they’re
worse than ever, but so much better
than no entertainment at all.

If you offer money as an excuse
for not going, o.k., but you must then
look for cheaper fun, with an eye
toward maximum time wasted.

WEL Flick Teams Are Faltering;
Let’s Waste Time, Go To More Movies

For lack of things to do in Lex-
ington most people seem to be
studying. This is unhealthy. But so
is doing nothing, so the answer is
to do as much as you can while ac-
complishing nothing. I’ve found my-
self that jig-saw puzzles are pretty

Former Sports Editor Comments on De-Emphasization

Editor’s Note: The following letter
was sent to Mr. A. G. Skelley of
Sports Illustrated. A copy of the
letter was sent to the Ring-tum Phi
for publication.

Dear Mr. Skelly:

Your article on the success of
Washington and Lee’s de-empha-
sized football team was outstanding.
I want to congratulate you and
Washington and Lee.

However, you mentioned that in
1955 there was great pressure to re-
turn to big-time football. You said
campus polls favored it. As author
of this poll and sports editor of
the college newspaper at the time, I
would like to correct this statement.

We were not interested in return-
ing to big-time football. What we
suggested, and a copy of the poll will
verify this, was that amateur ath-
letics be retained but that a more
active interest be taken by the Uni-
versity and the board of trustees. We
emphasized the need for recruiting
on an amateur basis, among prep
schools and high schools to attract
good football players who were cap-
able of holding their own academi-
cally.

The results of our poll indicated
68 per cent of the student body and
faculty favored this action. With
the hiring of Lee McLaughlin in
1956, the University actually em-
barked on a program similar to that
suggested by the results of the poll.

We appealed for this action and are
extremely gratified with the present
results and feel the present Wash-
ington and Lee athletic policy is, in
part, a result of our efforts.

I feel that many schools, large or
small, would benefit from similar ac-
tion. You will notice that several
schools similar in size to Washington

and Lee, are now starting such an
athletic policy.

The entire national collegiate ath-
letic picture would be a great deal
brighter and could be freed from its
recent gambling and_ recruiting
blights if more schools would em-
bark on an athletic program similar
to Washington and Lee,

Sincerely yours,
EDGAR L. GROVE

“Precisely the same techniques are*

of three big PR
agencies to handle
advertising and
public relations
for the new Unit-
ed States Travel
Service. The firm’s
mission is to urge
travelers to come
here and to re-
move the doubts
that have, hereto-
fore, kept them
away.

If this mission was to be the ex-
tent of it then I could laugh and
say that America is going down to
Puerto Rico’s level, who is, as the
reader knows, currently being por-
trayed in various slick magazines
as an island paradise. However, to
go about selling tourists the agen-
cies must sell America.

 

Ketcham

To sell America, or to sell any-
thing for that matter, requires
working into and out of the “image
problem.” The agencies, in trying
to sell America must, necessarily,
delve into the realm of political
propaganda, Perhaps that is one
of Madison Avenue’s subtle aims,
but whatever it is, it certainly
raises matters both of increased
magnitude and different in kind
from the narrowly defined objec-
tive of selling a certain soap.

What is the definition of “selling
America”? Does it mean the adop-
tion of a conscious sales technique?
I am afraid that it does. A few
years ago Arthur Larson, author of
Modern Republicanism, and Dean of
Duke’s School of Law, spoke here at
W&L on the need for a positive ap-
proach in our relations with other
nations, a worked out idealogy rath-
er than the Great Haphazard we
usually practice.

Mr. Larson made a good point. I
do not think for a moment, however,
that he was thinking along the lines
propounded by PR. The United
States stands for truly great things
such as birth in revolution, love of
freedom and concern for one’s fel-
low man. I submit that it is not
possible to patently “sell” these
concepts.

It is often emphasized that we
as Americans are competing for
the minds of men. Is this really our
aim? America stands for freedom,
and this idea connotes our con-
cern for other peoples to be free
and to do as they will. It does not
mean that those persons in other
countries must ape us or do ex-
actly as we ourselves, but rather
that we as a nation are opposed to
controls being put on them either
by a dictatorship or totalitarian
government,

Alongside the notion that we are
competing for men’s minds comes
the idea of ethno-centraism. This is
the feeling, if I can state it simply,
| that what you have is better than

Seuaa Team All-American Center Fohs

Fohs Named All-American

Small College Center

Terry Fohs was named by the
Associated Press as second team
center on their Little All-American
squad. Steve Suttle, Charley Gum-
mey, Bob Payne and Tommy Good-
win, other members of the unde-
feated Generals, received honorable
mention.

Washington and Lee was the
only college in Virginia to land a
player on the first or second team.

Terry was also named by the Vir-
ginia Sports Writers and Sportscast-

 

ers Association as one of the three
outstanding football players in the
state for the 1961 season.

Coach Mac Praises

Coach Lee McLaughlin says about
Terry, “His consistancy is amaz-~
ing...he missed only part of one
game because of injury in four years
of hard play. I have never seen a
player with greater courage and it
will be impossible to replace him at
W&L,” added Coach Mace about the
145-lb. linebacker who will graduate

 

in June.

Wasps Smother Generals, 75-55

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Asst. Managing Editor

Emory and Henry broke
away to an early lead and coast-
ed to a 75-55 slaughter of
Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball team Monday night in the
wilds of Virginia.

F&M Wins 15-9;
W&L To Enter

Tournament

Washington and Lee’s matmen will
carry a 2-1 season record into the
First Annual Chatttanooga J.C. In-
tercollegian Wrestling tournament
this Friday and Saturday at Chat-
tanooga.

This will mark the first time
since W&L’s withdrawal from the
Southern Conference that the
General squad has participated in
a tournament.

Although the exact number of
schools in the tournament hasn’t
been determined yet, invitations
have been extended to such schools
as Lehigh, Auburn, The Citadel,
Alabama, Georgia, Davidson, Duke,
Sewanee, and Oklahoma State.

 

Individual contestants will be
ceded according to their overall
collegiate record, and the tourney
will be run on a one elimination
basis.

Saturday, the Franklin and Mar-
shall wrestlers squelched a General
comeback staged by Dick Albert
and Jud Babcock who put together
back-to-back wins, and prevailed
15-9. The final outcome was decided
in the unlimited bout in which the
F&M heavyweight edged Bob Pa-
gano, 7-4.

Stover Wins

The most decisive General win of
the evening was freshman Tom
Stover’s 9-2 victory in the 137-lb.
class.

 

Mermen Swamp Norfolk; Tie William And Mary

Washington and Lee’s swim-
ming team emerged with a win
and a tie from their weekend
meets with Norfolk William

and Mary and W&M in Wil-

liamsburg.

The Mermen topped Nor-
folk W&M 61-34 Friday night
and then tied W&M the next
afternoon, 43-43.

Against Norfolk the Generals
were led by victories from John
Lundy in the 220, Jim Wearn in
the 50, and Mike Harris in the 200
backstroke. W&L also took the
medley relay and the 400-yd. free
style relay. Diver Bruce Houghten
put in what Coach Norris East-
man called “his best effort so far

 

this season,” to capture second
place in the diving event.

Lundy also won the 440 free-style,
Jim Wallenstein took the 200 breast-
stroke event, and Jahncke won the
100-yd. free-style. |

The W&M meet the following af-
ternoon produced a rarity in swim-
ming: a tie. The Generals again
won the medley relay, and Cap-
tain Elliott Maynard turned in his

The Wasps, urged on by a wild
crowd, which appeared to be seek-
ing blood for E&H’s football loss to
W&L, grabbed the lead for good
with 7:30 left in the half on a pair
of free throws by Larry Nave.

From there on out it was a mat-
ter of how much Emory could add
to its margin. The Wasps threw
up every kind of shot imaginable
and most of the wierd ones went
in. One shot hit the rim bounced
straight up nearly to the top of
the backboard, hit the rim again,
bounced up again, and finally fell
through.

Guard Louis Paterno and captain
Bip Fauber paced a_ second-half
General surge that kept W&L within
breathing distance of the Wasps un-
til late in the game.

Defeat, coupled with a 55-54 loss
to Catholic U. last Saturday dropped
the Generals’ record to 1-3.

F&M Friday

W&L’s next game is Friday against
Franklin and Marshall at 8 p.m. at
Doremus Gymnasium.

Emory placed five men in double
figures, headed by guard Bill Troy’s
19. W&L’s scoring leaders were
Fauber with 15 and Paterno and Jon
Supak with 11 points each.

Led by 6-4 Footsie Brown’s 21
rebounds, the Wasps dominated the
boards over the shorter Generals.
Fauber paced W&L with 19.

The Generals look much more im-

 

pressive in their one-point loss to; until Paterno put the Generals one-

the Catholic Cardinals Saturday.

Down 27-21 at halftime, W&L
staged a roaring comeback. A
jump shot by Fauber with 8:16
left tied the score at 44-44. Then
the Generals’ Mr. Everything put
W&L ahead 46-44 with a long
jump shot.

The lead swayed back and forth

up at 54-53 with a driving lay-up.

But Lady Luck smiled the other
way as Catholic guard Gene Horan
fired a 15-foot jumper with 0:25 left
to clinch the win for the Cardinals.

Paterno Top

Paterno paced the Generals’ score-
| ing with 13 points. Ide got 11, Fauber,
ten.

 

Baby Generals Squash Fishburne;

The Baby General _ basketball
team won over a small, outclassed
Fishburne five 69-30 yesterday in
Doremus gym.

Livingston Gets 19
Led by Dick Livingston’s 19
points W&L was never seriously
challenged. Madison with 12 points
and Kowalski with 13 markers also
helped the scoring.

Coach Lyles used most of his

bench in the game and during the

second half tried out different of-

fenses and defenses with his squad.

High man for Fishburne with 9
points was Steve Utley.

SMA Next

The Baby Generals are shooting
for the game with Staunton Military
Academy, top ranked in state mili-
tary schools. W&L meets them here
this Wednesday.

Time-Wasting Is The Only

Faltering Tradition Here

good for this, especially if you throw
away ten or twelve pieces before you
start.

You can get puzzles with pieces
already missing at the Opportunity
Shop for a dime—and I guarantee
at least six hours of fun.

People with a good background
in puzzles should try working them
upside down—or in the dark.

Another thing I can recommend
for adept students is model air
planes—build them, paint them, hang
them from the ceiling, then shoot
them down with a BB gun.

If you don’t have any motivation
about you at all, then watch TV or
something, but for the University’s
sake start wasting some time. Take
the above suggestions and mold them
to your own needs. (If you have
a roommate, playing jackrocks is
fun but your hands get very dirty.

After Christmas Ill go into sug-
gestions about going over the hill
and down the road, but start now on
your individual time-wasting. Then
as exams approach I'll be sure to
point out advantages and disadvant-
ages of each room in the Library.

But before the remainder of the

McThenia Issues Statement

McThenia issued a statement con-
cerning the committee, which said
that, “It is the opinion of the
Executive Committee that these men
are well qualified. It is also be-
lived that they will be of great
service to the University.”

“It is hoped,” he said, “that
students will support the Control
Committee, and that the Student
Body won't betray the trust the
faculty has shown in W&L’s stu-
dents.” (See Editorial on Page 2.)

In other business last night, Stu-
dent Body Secretary Steve Suttle
reported that his sub-committee has
completed work on the proposed re-
forms to the Constitution. He said
that the text of these reforms will
be released after Christmas vacation.

Two complete constitutions, he
reported, have been received along
with several individual proposed
amendments to the Constitution.

 

What Will Be The Result
Of Advertising America?

(Continued from page 2)

what others have. This idea is
equally prevelant in either the sell
America concept or the Christian
missionary effort. That is to say,
there is something naive and over-
simplified in attempting to trans-
plant ideas nurtured at home to a
different climate and soil.

The hiring of three agencies
has opened the door to Washing-
ton. As the president of one big
agency says: “the travel drive will
open the way for the large scale
intervention of the advertising
profession in the cold war. This is
what we must subtly work to-
ward.”

It is clear that these men, who
have long hoped for an inroad to
Washington, will be pressing on
now that they have their feet in.

The possibility of greater influence
by Madison Avenue is objectionable.
There is the simple matter of money.
The current lobby is seeking some-
thing like a multi-million dollar ap-
propriation for the travel campaign.
Another cloud rises over the in-
creased hodgepodge of bureaucracy.
Government must go on and all that,
but to create additional arms with
such growth potential only gums
things a bit more.

The cat is out of the bag and
everyone is in the courtyard. To be
concerned about our country, to wish
to help and to believe that those
skills practiced in one area will work
equally well in another is only
natural.

But mix PR with The Image, prop-
aganda, ideas cherished by men,
and Washington; just what does re-
sult?

Dr. Hughes Says Communism
Will Not Replace Christianity

By SHANNON JUNG

Communism does not possess such
permanent stature as to be placed in
the same league as Christianity. The
Communist transient threat of win-|
ning men’s minds intellectually is|
no longer appealing—in fact, it
seems to be dying now.

These conclusions terminated a
lecture by Dr. Thomas Hughes of
the history department who spoke
to a student group Tuesday night,
as the second in a series of talks
sponsored by the UCA.

Entitled, “Communism vs. Chris-
tianity,” the lecture was followed
by an active period of discussion.

Stressing the inadequacy of the
spiritual offerings of Communism,
Hughes analyzed the misunderstand-
ings in the nature of the struggle
by Christian laymen.

One misconception Hughes pointed
out was that Communism is a threat
merely because it is God-less. Equal-
ly erroneous is the conception
that Communists are continuously
closing churches. “Their opposing
Christianity would be as politically
clumsy as a politican here coming
out against motherhood.”

No economic system is more meri- |
torious than any other in the sight)
of God. Thus, our most serious)
misconception asserting the con-|
demnation of a communist economic
system has no basis.

As a historian, Hughes suggests)
that the nature of the threat is its

 

and German. Yesterday was the 14th

engenderment of enthusiasm, being
highly idealistic. Karl Marx was the
embodiment of the self-sacrificing
life. These high ideals extend even
to Communist belief in an eventual
utopia. A worldly utopia and the
progressive and idealistic movements
towards one are serious threats.

Communism is an escape from
freedom. The security derived from
authritative command is often more
attractive than the freedom of de-
ciding whether or not to follow
Christian ideals.

One of the last serious threats
mentioned was the belief that eco-
nomic welfare will bring spiritual
improvement. This theory, conclu-
sively disproved after World War I,
is often blindly accepted.

While Communism §rationalizes,
Christianity stands firm on its tra-
ditional principles. Hughes said that
Christians had no right to justify
forsaking their families while, under
a similar pressure, communist self-
sacrifice rationalizes anything.

Hughes concluded that an exam-
ination of Communism and Christi-
anity is both helpful and hopeful.
It helps Christians define their po-
sition more accurately. It indicates
a future divine discontent and spir-
itual bankruptcy in the achievement
of Communist utopia.

The Communist is now seeking
spiritual fulfillment. Will the in-
adequate offerings of a transient sys-

Dr. Thomas
Says Christmas

Is Humble Time)

By STEVE SMITH

Dr. J. N. Thomas delivered a
Christmas message of humility to
4 capacity audience at last night’s
University Christmas Candlelight
Service.

Using as his text Paul’s letter to
the Philippians, Dr. Thomas con-
trasted the humility of Christ in
siving up his divine right, with the
inherent pride in men. The letter
was written by Paul in an effort to
heal a breach in the church at Phil-
ippi, apparently caused by pride.

“What better gift than a humility
pattern on His own” could we bring
Christ at Christmas, asked Dr.
Thomas?

Dr. Thomas said that when Christ

became man, he did not leave off be- |

ing God. Even though he remained
divine, his act was one of infinite
condescension. The Christ retained
divine power, love , truth, and holi-
ness when he became man; but he

gave up omnipotence, omnipresence, |

and omniscence. He became humbly

obedient to his Father, even to the,

death of the cross.

The power and majesty of God
is not incongruous with his humility;
humility is not weakness, but
strength. It can unseat the mortal
ego.

The interdenominational service,
first held in 1916, was held under
the auspices of the University Chris-
tian Association. Dr. David Sprunt,
W&L Chaplain, was the presiding
minister.

Four students read the traditional
Christmas scripture. The readers
were Ashley Wiltshire, John Dun-

nell, Roger Paine, and Mervin Clay.

 

 

tem be satisfactory? Is this the po-
tent ethical threat of Communism?

F, D. Costume
Sales Are Up

Sales of Fancy Dress costumes
totalled 321 last week, compared to
a total of 280 sold for the 1961 Fancy
Dress Ball.

Dance Board vice president Frank
Young credited the Dance Board
Advisory Council for stimulating the
added interest in this year’s Ball.
Young also feels that students were
attracted by the announcement that

the big dance will be held in the!

Commons this year.

The full dress costumes are re-
quired for the “High Society” theme
of the Ball. Girls will wear formal
dresses of their own choosing.

 

National Student Association Is
Active Despite Fire From Right

The largest student confederation
in the United States is the US.
National Student Association, which
claims to “speak for all American
students,” although it represents
only a fraction of that number.

Although Washington and Lee is
not a member of the National Stu-
dent Association, or NSA, junior
Craig Distlehorst attended the or-
ganization’s Fall Regional Assembly,
held December 1-2, in Greensboro,
N. C. Distlehorst, woh holds the
office of Executive Secretary of the
Young Republicans Clubs, acted as
an observer at the convention. He
has reported on his experience to
W&L student body president Uncas
McThenia and to the Ring-tum Phi.

The Carolinas-Virginia Regional
meeting of NSA was held at the
Woman’s college of the University of
North Carolina, in Greensboro. The |
topic of the convention was the|
University in Developing Areas, spe- |
cifically Asia, Africa, and  Latin|
America. |

Distlehorst had the choice of one}

 

cent of American colleges and uni-
versities, a number under 400, but
for over a decade has been repre-
sented at youth conferences all over
the world and before Congress in
Washington as the voice of Ameri-
can students. It is an organization |
of student governments rather than |
of local clubs.

Besides engaging in political is-|
sues, which is its main activity, the|
NSA promotes improvements in stu-
dent government. Its political stands |
are ultra-liberal: the NSA platform |
includes endorsement of the student |
riots which turned Eisenhower away
from Japan; favor of Castro’s
spreading of Culture in Cuba, and
condemnation of the U.S. part in
invading the island; recognition of |
Red China; and promotion of the)
Peace Corps. Such plans of the NSA |
platform are established at an annual |
summer convention at which plat- |
forms are adopted.
Group Under Hot Fire |

The NSA summer Congress of 1961 |

are billed as those of the NSA, just
as those passed in general assembly.
At the 1960 national convention, the
delegates passed 13 resolutions while
the Executive Committee passed 84.

Moreover, opponents have pointed
out, the committee of 30 which is
entitled the voice of “all American
students” is not itself representative.
Its regional structure is set so that
New England, which has 10 times
as many members as does the Utah
region, has only twice as many EC
votes as does Utah.

The method of electing campus
delegates to NSA conventions is an-
other point under attack. The NSA
constitution does not require that
representatives be elected—they may
be appointed by the student govern-
ment of the school they represent.

These argument are difficult to
counter.

Macon student body president will |

most of which was conducted as a|
round-table. The primary subject |
discussed was the development of |
education in Asian countries. Amer- |
ican foreign aid policy and similar |
topics were also raised during the |
two days.

Speakers to the convention in-|
cluded the Vice-President on Na-|
tional Affairs for the NSA, and a
representative of the Peace Corps.

The NSA represents only 20 per|

tion, there have been many attacks |

New Portrait of Mr. Mattingly

University

Given Portrait

Of Mattingly

An anonymous donor has given
an oil portrait of Earl S. Mattingly,
who has been university trasurer
since 1940, to Washington and Lee.

Prof. Rupert N. Latture, acting
for the donor, presented the paint-
ing to Washington and Lee Presi-
dent Fred C. Cole in a small cere-
mony in the President’s office
Tuesday. Mr. Mattingly was there
for the presentation.

The portrait was done by Mrs. H.
Donahoe, of St. Petersburg, Fla.,
from photographs of Mr. Mattingly.

Mr. Mattingly, who serves in the
dual capacity of secretary of the uni-
versity’s Board of Trustees and
treasurer, first came to Washington
and Lee in 1917 as a student. Af-
ter service with the U. S. Army in
World War I, he returned and re-
ceived his bachelor of arts degree
in geology in 1925. While a student
he served as university registrar,
and after graduation continued in
that capacity until his appointment
as treasurer. He was a student assist-
ant in the Treasurer’s Office in
1917.

A native of Washington, D.C., Mr.
Mattingly attended Randolph-Ma-
con Academy in Front Royal from

“In class I try to make music a

Phillips Asked
To Anaylze Bill

Senator John L. McClellan of
Arkansas, chairman of the Senate
Labor Investigations Committee, has
asked Dr. Charles Phillips, W&L
economics professor, to submit an
analysis of a proposed Senate bill
designed to place the nation’s trans-
portation unions under the anti-trust
laws.

The bill would amend the anti-
trust laws so as to prohibit certain
activities of transportation labor or-
ganizetions in restraint of trade.

 

‘Music Is An Experience
That Must Be Conveyed’

For the non-technical student,
Stewart offers an_ introductory
course in music designed to “en-
hance the students’ understanding
and enjoyment of music.” The more
advanced student may take theory
and composition of music in which
practical exercises and original com-
positions are required. This is an-
other way of making music “come
alive.”

Outside the classroom, “I try to
create musical experience though
participation, to create a program
which will serve as a means of ex-
pression for the students,” Stewart
said.

In creating this program of ex-
pression, Stewart assists and directs
a number of extra-curricular activi-
ties, among them are: the Glee Club,
the Capperales, the John A. Graham
Brass Choir and the Chamber Music
Class.

Born in Buffalo, N. Y., Stewart
attended the American Conservatory
of Music in Chicago where he took
master’s degrees in music education,
violin and composition. With the ex-
ception of a tour of duty in the

in the navy he did the music for
two radio shows, “On Target” and

 

Dr. Phillips believes that the bill
is inadequate, and that it would
create more problems than it would
solve.

“If you apply anti-trust laws to
labor unions, all unions should be
included, not just transportation.

“This is a point of fairness. Why
single out a single group?

“Senator McClellan hopes to ap-
ply anti-trust laws to the Teamsters
first, and then to the other unions
as the need arises. But there is a
danger of reducing the effectiveness
of the anti-trust laws by constant
amendment.

“This is the lesson we have learn-
ed with our tax structure. Constant
amendment can only result in con-
| fusion and ineffciency.

“And by dragging labor into the
present anti-trust system, we may
very well lose our ability to deal
with management.”

Dr. Phillips feels that McClellan’s
bill does not attack the heart of the
problem.

“The only solution to the current
labor problem is to reduce the size
of the bargaining units. Industry-
wide bargaining is a hinderance to
competitive enterprize, because there
is always the danger of an industry-
wide strike. We must this
problem first.”

The bill seems to have virtually no
chance of Senate approval in the
forthcoming session.

“The Teamsters themselves,” says
Dr. Phillips, “are strong enough to
check the bill. And the AFL-CIO,
although currently at odds with the
Teamsters, would certainly join
| them in this case.”

“Meet Your Navy.” He came to

| Washington and Lee in 1954 and}

| since that time has worked for and
inspired a trend in increasing inter-
|; est in music here.

Besides his work on campus, Pro-
| fessor Stewart also “experiences”
music by participating in numerous
musical organizations in Virginia and
the East. He is concert master with
the Roanoke Symphony and associ-
ate composer for the American Mu-
sic Center. He also serves as treasur-

sic Association and on the board of
trustees of the Bennington Com-
posers Conference
Music Players, Inc.

In addition to his directorial and
performing work, Stewart is
a composer of some note. Tomorrow
evening three of his compositions for
woodwind instruments are to be
performed at Columbia University
in New York City. At the next per-
formance of the Roanoke Symphony
on February 12, his Prelude for
Strings will be given. The Birm-
ingham Festival of Arts in February
will present his Five Visions for a
woodwind quintet. The Three Pieces
for a Woodwind Quintet will be per-
formed for the first time in New this
April on the Music in Our Time
series.

Professor Stewart is a strong be-
liever in modern music. Though he
realizes that it is not yet popular
with most audiences he sees it as
growing force in music in the coming
years. “It has had a hard climb,”
he says, “but it becomes more inter-

An Episcopalian, Mr. Mattingly has

and is now a trustee of the church.
From 1949 to 1955, he was a trustee
and member of the board of the

Guerrilla War

Is Discussed

By STEVE SMITH

Dr. Milton Colvin of Washington
and Lee’s Political Science Depart-
ment presented some of the startling
possibilities of unconventional war-
fare to the ROTC students Wednes-
day night.

Colvin, a World War II combatant
in unconventional action, and until
1958 commander of a reserve para-
chutist unit, spoke in Lee Chapel to
freshmen and sophomore ROTC
members.

An atomic bomb detonated in the
ocean could create a tidal wave
which would wash Washington and
New York off the map and reach
inland 200 miles, Colvin said. By
solar energy, it could be possible also
to bring back the ice age in a given
area. Colvin went on to list the in-
cidents described in the book Ugly
American as unconventional war-
fare also. These are opposite ex-
tremes in the methods of activities
which Colvin treated principally
as guerrilla warfare.

Colvin said that the United States
is now involved in unconventional
warfare. “Perhaps it may head off
total war.” Propaganda and psycho-
logical devices were classed as un-
conventional war. A man could to-
day carry in his suitcase a bomb
which could wipe out New York
City. Colvin also presented the idea
of selective assassination, by which
| a power could rid itself of leaders
| vital to its enemies.

In unconventional warfare, Colvin
said, “Your job is to survive.” In

Suggestions For Santa:

Some Critical Changes

Dear Santa,

Knowing that we are probably going to get switches and
coals for asking for some big things for the University this fall,
we are sending along the following list of more modest re-
quests:

A year’s supply of wrappers for Mr. Coleman to wrap his
hard-won nickles in.

A cold-quiz file for the NFU’s, oops, Independents.

An Executive Committee of their own for Protest.

A complete set of Hot Nuts recordings for the Anderson
Music Room.

An autographed picture of William Buckley for the Con-
servative Society.

A complete Telescreen installation for the Assimilation
Committee, a la 1984.

Some customers for the Arthur Murray Dance Studio on
Washington Street.

A year’s subscription to the New York Daily News for the
Tuesday Staff.

A horsewhip for the Control Committee.

Lavatory facilities for the Hollins Inn.

Another magazine article on W&L for MCCRUMS.

A Safe Christmas and a Sane New Year for everyone.

The Facts At Randolph-Macon

From an editorial (reprinted below on this page )in the
Randolph-Macon’s College newspaper commenting on a recent
National Student Association conference:

“Getting the facts is a difficult and laborious task... For
instance, in Latin America, the difference between Marxist
and a Communist is held as basic to an understanding of the
present situation in Cuba. To the members of this Conference
from South America, a Marxist-Leninist was vastly different
from a member of the Red Communist party.”

Just what in the hell is the vast difference between a
Marxist-Leninist and a Communist?

Yes, getting the facts is definitely a difficult and laborious
task.

NSA, anyone?

 

‘Knowledge Is Power’

From the Sun Dial, Randolph-Macon Woman’s College:

Getting the facts is a difficult and laborious task. It involves details,
and these are at times elusive. However, they are attainable. The NSA
conference brought out little known aspects of the actual conditions in
Algeria. The Algerians must go outside the country for education—this
involves money. The American press, because of its allegiance to France
must necessarily withhold some of this information. These facts were given
by Rachid Benouameus, President of the U. S. Branch of the National
Union of Students of Algeria.

Another fact introduced at this conference was a concept of academic
freedom unknown to U. S. Students. In Rhodesia political freedom for the
black is almost nil. In Ghana, the student follows a British-styled program
that does not meet the demands of his society. There appears to be a
complete lack of student choice within the University. As a contrast the
students in Panama elect their own Deans and, as in most Latin American
countries, they have political asylum within the boundaries of the school.
In Asia, the students are main political forces and have the inflence to
keep an American president from visiting.

Obscure facts sometimes provide an insight into the general reaction
of these new nations. For instance, in Latin America, the difference be-
tween a Marxist and a Communist is held as basic to an understanding
of the present situation in Cuba. To the members of this Conference from
South America, a Marxist-Lenist was vastly different from a member of
the Red communist party. A Marixst was another form of the Fabian
society which was the socialistic society in England formed in the latter
part of the 19th Century.

The natural reaction of America to Castro’s announcement as a Marxist
was that here is a Communist at our door. But to a member of the Latin
American communities, the reaction is not the same. For a Marxist is
common in Latin America, and is not the evil subject of USSR. Nor does
this mean that they are Communist dupes, for apparently some of the
most liberal leaders are avowed Trotskyites, followers of the Stalin-deposed
campaigner for immediate world revolution to the Communist camp.

The world is full of facts and again, it takes hard work to discern
the truth from the maze of prejudices and obscurities. This means that
Americans must begin to rework their ideas of world politics. No longer
ean we consider that the foreigners are always wrong. Nor can we relax.
If we do wish to remain intelligent individuals, we have to obtain ade-
quate facts. This might involve some effort on our part in various ways,
but it would be better to know the reasons for our neighbor’s troubles than
be guilty of being “dupes” of ignorance ourselves.

Protest-R-T P
Duel Builds
Mental Muscles

By HOWARD SLATER

If we as students continue to
look with contemptuous disfavor at
the feud between the Ring-tum Phi
and Protest, then we will being do-
ing ourselves an extreme disservice.
Once again we have the oppor-
tunity to choose between form and
substance. Once again we are drift-
ing toward the unsubstantial.

In common everyday language,
what that means is: What’s so crazy
about criticism? Does “Jenkinson’s
Law,” which says that “everybody’s
crazy”—does that just obliterate the
good that down-to-earth construc-
tive criticism can perform?

More Than Name Calling

I think not. The situation really
amounts to more than just name
calling. There was a lot of truth in
the charges of both newspapers—
and I am quite willing to use that
term advisedly. Hasn’t it been a
common gripe around this campus
that the Ring-tum Phi doesn’t pro-
vide what it ought to provide? Yet
when Protest—“the young upstart
that it is’—comes out and prints
what’s on everybody’s minds for
years, then Protest is condemned
for underscoring “its own apparent
shaky mental attitudes.” Shaky men-
tal attitudes my eye! If saying that
the Ring-tum Phi could do better
makes one mentally shaky, then
Jenkinson’s Law is perfectly appli-
cable. We are all crazy!

Turning the coin over, we ought
to realize that the Ring-tum Phi had
some good points to make. “Guerrila
tactics” and inflammatory prose are a
little more suited, at times, to the
hinterlands of Guantanomo Bay than
to the student body which Protest
ostensibly hopes to appeal to. The
inconsistency of Protest leaves the
sneaking suspicion that there’s more
than one cook messing with that
broth. Sometimes, somebody drops in
the wrong recipe.

PROTEST Stimulates

But Bob Ketcham, and most of us
it would seem, don’t really appre-
ciate that by and large Protest real-
ly is “the positive force that it
purports to be.” This is because
Protest has been the most effective
stimulant of mental activity on our
campus. Needless to say, there was—
and perhaps still is—a dearth of that
kind of activity. Bob Ketcham, be-
ing far from an anti-cerebral offend-
er, surprises me when he makes this
mistake.

By the same token, we are told to
dismiss as an undesirable develop-
ment the great strides which the
Ring-tum Phi has taken in the past
two years down from its Ivory
Tower. With the advent of Protest
this contact with the student body
became accelerated, for now there
was something to think about, talk
about and write about, instead of the
endless dirge about Apathy.

Is the Ring-tum Phi to throw
away this perfectly wonderful op-
portunity to be constructive, to
contribute significantly to a newly-
won concern for ideas and things
which many of us welcome on this
campus? Is the Ring-tum Phi to re-
turn to its Ivory Tower as “the offi-
cial Campus Voice?” (Official Cam-
pus Voice indeed! Why not Pravda?
That would really fit if we wanted
to be official.)

Peace, Gentlemen

In short, the Ring-tum Phi and
Protest ought not to quarrel. It’s not
nice! They have “lessened their
stature.” Lessened their stature? By
telling the truth, or a good deal of
it about one another? Nonsense! The
demand, mirrored in Bob Ketcham’s
letter, was for both publications to
ignore one another.

But you tell me how on earth one
of those papers could possibly ignore
the existence of the other? It can’t
be done. If the attempt were made,
now then we'd really see something
undignified.

Which brings us back to the origi-
nal reference about form and sub-
stance. We are mistaking the
awkardness with which these two
semi-journalistic antagonists blast
one another as the substance of the
blows. On the contrary, although
the blows may not look good, they
are landing with telling effect. That
is, they would land with effect if
we would forget about the awkward,
undiginified form, and concentrate
on the truth of the blows.

It is this truth which counts, not
How you say something but What
you say. Dignified inaction is for the
birds, or for the know-nothings—
which is what most of us were quite
recently. I say let those two giants
of the press slug it out. Every direct
hit is therapeutic—for them and for
us all. Our papers can become our
volitional Vic Tanney’s. We're just
a step away from developing bigger
and better mental muscles.

 

 

An Interview With Dr. Fishwick

 

The Population Explosion

By TRACY HARRINGTON

The holocaust of war, the travesty
of political imperialism, and the hor-
ror of untenable disease are fast
fading as the major world problems.

Taking their place as the biggest
threat to mankind is mankind itself.

As the population continues to
grow larger and larger at ever-
increasing rates, social scientists as
well as statesmen and _ theologians
are becoming more and more con-
cerned with the dilemma of too
many people.

According to Washington and Lee
Professor of American Studies Dr.
Marshall Fishwick, there is a “hor-
rible inevitablity” about the popula-
tion explosion.

“It’s a problem that can’t really
be solved by government,” Dr. Fish-
wick said. “There doesn’t seem to
be any way to avoid it.”

He said the problem was made "

even greater because we are not only
fighting ignorance but the sancity of
the family.

The Catholic

Dr. Fishwick cited the Roman
Catholic Church, “the main line of
Christianity,” as a major factor in
the problem because of its negative
stand on birth control.

“The United States is placed in a
particularly delicate position be-
cause we have a Roman Catholic
president,” he said.

Just what is the scope of the
dilemma?

Discussing the rate of population
increase, Dr. Fishwick quoted the
following statistics: “In 1650, Eu-
rope had 100 million people. In 1950,
she had 540 million. The United
States in 1650 had one million, and
160 million in 1950.

“And, most frightening of all—
Asia had 330 million people in 1650,
and in 1950 she had 937 million, al-
most tripling her population in 300

years.”
And the rates are increasing
constantly.

Medicine’s Role

Dr .Fishwick also talked about the
role of modern medicine in bringing
the problem about.

“Naturally by conquering disease
and increasing life spans, we in-
crease the population. When we (the
U.S.) move into a backward area,
we actually accentuate the prob-
lem by bringing them modern medi-
cine.

“If the people of India or China
lived as long as the people of the
United States, the increase in Asia’s
population would be overwhelming.”

He said that “those areas which
can least afford it are the ones hav-
ing the real explosion.”

   

Dr. Fishwick

“Patience and intelligent concern”

According to Dr. Fishwick, “nearly
two-thirds of the population live in
underdeveloped countries and terri-
tories.”

He said, “Approximately two-
thirds of the population is Negro,”
and he added that “this is the real
core of the problem.”

“And the rate of increase in the
Negro race is tremendously higher
than that of the Caucasian race.”

 

About one-half of the people of
the world, according to Dr. Fishwick,
make less than $100 a year actual
income.

Some areas, in desparation, have
begun to alleviate the problem. Ja-
pan, for instance, now has legalized
abortions.

The Prospects

The prospects for the future of
the world—if this problem is not
soon solved—are not encouraging.

Dr. Fishwick quoted Gunnar
Myrdal’s theory on the outcome:
“The rich countries will get richer
and the poor ones will get poorer.
All forms of democratic systems and
free inquiry will disappear.

“Misery and despair,” he said,
“will prevail. And there is no
quicker way to have a communist
world than for the world’s people
to be despairing and miserable.”

Is there a solution? If so, what?

“In the past century, the Western
world tended to flourish on what one
critic called the three p’s—piracy,
patronage and paternalism.

“This day has passed—the only
way out is to show patience and
intelligent concern for the rest of
the world. Nowhere is this more
evident than in the problem of the
population explosion.”

New Viewpoints Needed

Continuing, Dr. Fishwick pointed
out that we “have to use our new
scientific knowledge, not only to
mold biology as we must and are
doing, but to mold our moral and
religious viewpoints.

“We have to get into the realms
of the spirit,” he said. “If we are
ever to survive, a new response is
demanded.”

Is there, really, anything being
done at the present time?

Again Dr. Fishwick did not seem
optimistic.

“Very little is being done to re-
leive the problem now. We are para-
lyzed by a number of factors.”

 

Behind The News

W&L’s candidate for a Rhodes
Scholarship, Rosie Page, failed to
qualify in the Virginia state elimi-
nations. Had he qualified he would
have faced another series of inter-
views in regional eliminations at
Atlanta, Ga.

Virginia’s finalists are Edward Or-
ser, of Bon Air, from Randolph-
Macon, and John Kirby, Jr., of
McLean, from the University of
Virginia law school.

PROTEST has recently attacked
the Friday Edition for not publishing
the EC minutes. Steve Suttle, how-
ever, brings the minutes to the print
shop every week. Unfortunately, the
minutes of the weekly meetings
seldom contain anything of interest
to anyone but EC members.

The minutes consist primarily of
minute administrative details, and
are generally not considered news-
worthy by the Friday staff.

ok * *

Caught in a history lecture: “In
the Twenties, there was a great ten-
dency for young American authors
to go to Paris and live on the Left
Bank of the Rhine.”

And again: “In the Thirties, there
emerged a new literary style known

as stream-of-consciousness. The
leader of this style was Joyce
Kilmer.”

 

 

To the Editor:

I wish to add my commendations
to the others which I am sure the
Board of Trustees have received as
a result of their action on the invi-
tation to Martin Luther King.

There is just about as much point
in inviting King to speak on “relat-
ing Christianity to major current is-
sues” as there would be in inviting
entrepreneurs of “the hill” (assum-
ing “the hill” carries with it the same
connotation it did 25 years ago) to
speak on marriage problems or to
address a Sociology Seminar. Both
are law violators of a sort; both defy
convention; to those who consider
themselves benefited by the viola-
tions, both are regarded as serving
a useful purpose. While King may

 

be considered a leader in his field,
you shouldn’t sell “the hill” short.
I don’t know what got into the
faculty, for certainly the faculty of
25 years ago would have handled
the latter invitation.

If you really want to kick up a
stink, why don’t a bunch of you
get together and invite colored girls
to Fancy Dress this year? This would
pretty well ruin it for the rest of
your school mates and their dates,
and it would damn sure finish it off
as the outstanding college social
event of the South.

I-M Basketball Action—Sigma Nu’s vs. SPE’s.

I-M Basketball
Wins Posted By |
Beta’s, Nu’s

Intramural basketball entered its
seventh week with Sigma Nu and
the Betas undefeated in their re-
spective leagues. Sigma Nu has top-
ped Pi Phi and SPE, while the lead-
ers in Division A have victories over
Phi Ep and PiKA.

Led by the scoring of Fred Nel-
son, Sigma Nu easily downed the
cagers from SPE 44-19. Nelson had
twelve points, while nine of his
teammates also contributed baskets.

In the Beta-PiKA contest, the
game was close until the final min-
utes of play when the Betas scored
five straight points to assure vic-
tory. With Ray Gordon hitting for
17 points, the Betas received their
second win by 40-33.

In other games, Phi Delt downed
ZBT 30-28, Phi Kap defeated SPE
35-26, and SAE overran DU 41-34.

Phi Kap remained unbeaten in
I-M bowling by easily downing
Kappa Sig 3-0 last week. Freshman
Jim Bassart and John Kiely led
their teammates to the third straight
victory. Bussart had a 555 total,
while Kieley’s was 513. The com-
bined score for Phi Kap was 2406,
compared to Kappa Sig’s 2107.

On the same evening the Betas
met the bowlers from SPE and easily
won the contest 4-0. Leading the
victors were Mendell and Hender-
son.

Still leading the league in indi-
vidual averages is freshman Vic
Galef. Galef has a 203 average,
with his high game totaling 236.

Wrestlers Ready For

Washington and Lee’s wrestling
team will carry some top individual
records to Chattanooga this week-
end for the first Southern Invita-
tional Wrestling Tournament .

Sporting such top performers as
co-captain Sandy Mersereau and
Dave Montgomery, Coach Richard
Miller says the Generals have “a
pretty good individual won and lost
record for any team to take to any
tournament.” Mersereau, a _ 157
pounder, has compiled a 22-7-1 rec-
ord in a little over three seasons,
and Montgomery, a junior who
weighs 130, has a 17-5 record.

Although the tournament will not
affect team standings, the individual
records will be altered by the re-
sults of the matches. The Generals
will be meeting wrestlers from Au-
burn, Georgia, Chattanooga, Emory,
Alabama, Florida State, Sewanee
and Applachian.

Staunton Hands
Baby Generals

First ’61 Loss

A lackluster second half perform-
ance by Washington and Lee’s fresh-
man basketball team handed Staun-
ton Military Academy a 69-43 vic-
tory yesterday. It was the Baby
Generals’ first 1961 defeat.

Trailing by five points at half-
time, 37-32, W&L scored only one
point during the first eight minutes
of the second half, giving SMA
plenty of opportunity to run up a big
lead.

While Staunton’s guards were
opening up the Baby General de-
fense for easy lay-ups, everything
that Washington and Lee threw up
at the basket failed to go in.

High-scoring Dick Livingston
scored only four points, and Jerry
Kowalski could manage only five.

George Madison was high for the
losers with 10.

Brill Craig had 18, and Jerry Fish-
er 15 for SMA.

First Half

Staunton jumped into an early
lead at the beginning of the game,
but the Generals came back to tie
the score with five minutes left in
the first half.

An aggressive W&L defense forced
SMA into numerous offense mis-
takes, resulting in a series of easy
lay-ups for the Generals, many of
which were missed.

Madison and _ Livingston,

from the floor, couldn’t find the
range, and guard Scotty Varner’s
shooting was the only thing that kept

Cagers Against F-M
In Doremus Tonight

Washington and Lee’s varsity basketball team gets one
more pre-Christmas chance to get back in the winning column
when it meets Franklin and Marshall here tonight in Doremus
Gymnasium. Game time is 8:00.

Franklin and Marshall comes into the game with a 2-2 rec-
ord, with wins over Swathmomre and Ursinus. In both wins, the

Diplomats’s fast-breaking offense has*¥

rolled up over 80 points.

Washington and Lee is 1-3 for the
year.

Defense

Head Coach Bob McHenry said
he'll send his Generals into a 3-2
double team defense in order to
hold down the high scoring Dips.

It was this defense that sparked
the Generals to their best effort of
the season against powerful Catho-
lic University last Friday.

Even thought Catholic pulled out
a last-ditch one-point win, W&L
held the visitors to a season’s low
on offense, 55 points.

Offense
The Washington and Lee defense
will have to be at its best tonight
to hold down the taller and more

experienced Diplomats.
Franklin and Marshall operates
from a 3-2 offense, using two 6’5”
sophomores, John Farrell and Roy

 

 

Forbescue, under the basket.
High scorers for the Dips are
guards Bob Leslie and Phil Hallen.

“They love to fast-break,” said
McHenry. “We'll have to be up all
the way to contain them.”

Generals

McHenry will open with a slightly
adjusted lineup tonight, with fresh-
man Louie Paterno moving into a
starting role in the backcourt.

Paterno, who sat out almost all of
W&L’s first two games, is already
the Generals second high scorer for

Phi Psi Trips
KS Grapplers

(Continued from page 3)
Phi Kap’s Bussart is second in this
department.

In one of the most exciting wrest-
ling contests of the year, Phi Psi
edged out Kappa Sig 21-15, with the
last individual match deciding the
score. With the score reading 18-
15, Phi Psi’s Jimmy Russ met Jim
Sylvester in the unlimited division.
Russ emerged the victor as he de-
feated his counterpart on points,
14-10.

Also in wrestling the grapplers
from KA had an easy evening
against the Betas as they won 30-5.
The Betas received their five points
when KA forfeited in the 147 Ib.
class. On the same day Sigma Nu
topped Lambda Chi 30-10.

The handball schedule has been
marred with many forfeits. The most
recent have been SAE’s to Sigma
Chi and the failure of the NFU
to show against Phi Delt.

In other contests PiKA shutout
Kappa Sigma 5-0, while the repre-
sentatives from ZBT were losing
to KA by the same score.

Need the Win

McHenry called the Franklin and
Marshall game one of the year’s
most important games from a morale
standpoint.

“We need to get this second win
before we go home,” he said. “We
don’t know exactly what to expect
from Franklin and Marshall, but
we know they'll be up for us.”

McHenry plans to emphasize re-
bounding and shooting against the
taller Dips.

“We need to hit 50 per cent from
the floor to win,” he said.

the Germans during the Second
World War. During the period 1941-
1943 the Germans lost 300,000 killed,
including 30 generals, and thousands
of pieces of rolling stock. In the
first half of 1944 the Nazi forces lost
1200 locomotives to the partisans,
Colvin stated.

The island-hopping amphibian
in the Pacific during the Warld War
were also cited as unconventional
warfare, revealing the scope to which
it can grow. But unconventional
warfare is still normally defined as
guerrilla operations involving only
a limited number of men.
this type of fighting, the mind is
the most powerful weapon, mental
agility being the most valuable asset.

The most important factors which
the guerrilla fighter must overcome

people; an American must know
how to make use of the beliefs of
people of other races.

“There is nothing new about un-

He cited the trick of the Trojan
horse as an early example. Later ex-
amples include Lawrence of Arabia,
Francis Marion, and the late William
Darby of World War II, under whom
Colvin served. (It was Darby who

Staunton quit making errors on
offense, and the Generals couldn't
do anything right.

After eight minutes of the half,
Coach Joe Lyles benched the entire
first team in apparent disgust, and
let the second and third stringers

SALUTE: STEVE BANKS

Because of Steve Banks, who just two years ago was an
undergraduate engineering student, the Bell Telephone
System is closer to wiping out the noise (or “static”) that
sometimes interferes with telephone conversations.

On one of his first assignments, Steve examined the
noise levels that had “leaked” into telephone circuits in

Colorado. His findings shed new light on the source of
noise, and on the important methods of measuring it.

America is a great country. America’s cities are full of houses.
America’s forests are full of trees. America’s rivers are full of
water. But it is not houses and trees and water that make
America great; it is curiosity—the constant quest to find
answers —the endless, restless “Why?” “Why?” “Why?”

Therefore, when I was told that Marlboro was a top seller
at colleges from USC to Yale, I was not content merely to
accept this gratifying fact, I had to find out why.

I hied myself to campuses in every sector of this mighty land.
Virst, I went to the Ivy League—dressed, of course, in an
appropriate costume: a skull-and-bones in one hand, a triangle
in the other, a mask-and-wig on my head, a hasty pudding in
my chops. “Sir,” I cried, seizing an Ivy Leaguer by the lapels,
which is no mean task considering the narrowness of Ivy League
lapels, Lut, I, fortunately, happen to have little tiny hands; in
fect, I spent the last war working in a small arms plant where, I
em} roud to say, I was awarded a Navy “E” for excellence and
v on many friends—‘‘Sir,” I eried, seizing an Ivy Leaguer by the
lapels, “how come Marlboro is your favorite filter cigarette?”

   

“Tm glad you asked that question, Shorty,’ he replied.
“Mar'Loro is my favorite filter cigarette because it is the filter
cirarette with the unfiltered taste.”

“Oh, thank you, sir!” I eried and ran posthaste to several
campuses in the Big Ten, wearing, of course, the appropriate
costurre: a plaid Mackinaw, birling boots, a Kodiak bear and
frost-hitten ears.

*pying an apple-cheeked young coed, I tugged my forelock
and said, “Excuse me, miss, but how come Marlboro is your
favorite filter cigarette?”

“I’m glad you asked that question, Shorty,’’ she replied.
“Marlboro is my favorite filter cigarette because the flavor is
flavorful, the flip-top box flips and the soft-pack is soft.”

“Oh, thank you, apple-cheeked young coed,” I cried and
bobbed a ecurtsey and sped as fast as my little fat legs would
carry me to several campuses in the Southwest, wearing, of
course, the appropriate costume: chaps, canteen, and several oil
leases. Spying a group of undergraduates singing “Strawberry
Roan,” I removed my hat and said, “Excuse me, friends, but
wihv is Marlboro your favorite filter cigarette?”

“We are glad you asked that question, Shorty,” they replied.
“Marlboro is our favorite filter cigarette because we, native sons
and daughters of the wide open spaces, want a cigarette that is
frank and forthright and honest. We want, in short, Marlboro.”’

“Oh, thank you, all,” I cried and, donning a muu muu, I set
sil for Hawaii, because in Hawaii, as in every state where Old
Glory flies, Marlboro is the leading seller in flip-top box. On
campus, off campus, in all fifty states, wherever people smoke for
pleasure in this great land of ours, you will find Marlboro.

And you will also find another winner from the makers of
Marlboro—the king-size, unfiltered Philip Morris
Commander, made by a new process to bring you new
mildness. Have a Commander. Welcome aboard.

Hungarian Refugee Leader

Will Speak Tuesday Night

A former Prime Minister of
Hungary will speak Tuesday to
a University audience.

Fernac Nagy, current chairman-
president of the Assembly of Cap-
tive European Nations, will discuss
the “Situation in Central-Eastern
Europe” in a public talk at 8 p.m.
in the university’s duPont Auditor-
ium. His appearance is being spon-
sored by the department of journal-
ism and communications.

Nagy will also speak to members
of the class in psychological warfare
and propaganda.

A native of Bisse, Hungary, the
former government official left Hun-
gary in exile in 1947. He was prime
minister in 1946 and 1947. He became
a member of the Hungarian Parlia-
ment for the first time in 1939 rising
to the group’s presidency in 1945.
He was also the country’s minister
of reconstruction that year. In 1944,

 

he was a prisoner of the German
Gestapo.

He is founder of the Smallholder’s
Party and the International Peasant
Union.

Nagy has been a chairman of the
foreign relations section of the Hun-
garian Committee, which is the exile
political organization embracing
post-war democratic Hungarian per-
sonalities and representatives of the
1956 Revolution. The committee’s
aim is the independence of Hungary
and the restoration of freedom for
Hungarians.

He has lectured at various clubs
and colleges throughout the country,
and is the author of articles in na-
tional magazines. His book, Struggle

Behind the Iron Curtain, was pub-*

lished in 1948.

Nagy has received honorary de-
grees from Bloomfield College and
the University of California.

He currently resides with his fam-
ily in Herndon.

European Prints

Are Shown Here

Prints by three European print-
makers go on display this week in
the duPont Art Gallery.

Some 35 prints by Johnny Fried-
laender, Hass and Fiorini will be
shown until the end of January,
according to Dr. Marion Junkin,
chairman of the sponsoring depart-
ment of fine arts. The prints are on
loan from a Baltimore art firm,
Roten, Ine.

Colored etchings and lithographs
and woodcuts will be included in
the month-long exhibition, the third
one held in the duPont gallery this
year.

“This is a unified and yet a di-
versified show,” Dr. Junkin said. “I
think Friedlaender is among the
two or three most important print-
makers living today.”

The prints will be for sale in a
price range of from $15 to $95, Dr.
Junkin said.

A sculpture collection from the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts was
scheduled for display during Jan-
uary, but the objects were not ready
for shipment to Washington and
Lee in time for Tuesday’s opening
date. The sculpture will be shown
during February, Dr. Junkin noted.

January is the last month in which
19 paintings from the Cincinnati
Museum of Fine Arts will be dis-
played in the parlors of the univer-
sity’s Evans Dining Hall. A new
exhibition will be hung by Dr. Jun-
kin during the examination period
at the end of the month.

 

W&L Given $1,500 Check
By Texaco Corporation

Washington and Lee has been se-
lected as a participant in the Texaco,
Inc., aid-to-education program for
support of privately-endowed col-
leges and universities.

The receipt of a check for $1,500
was announced today by President
Fred C. Cole. The funds, yet undes-
ignated, have no restrictions from
the donor.

Other Texaco gifts for the 1961-62
academic year are unrestricted do-
nations to privately-endowed col-
leges, but part of the old company’s
total gift involves scholarship and
fellowship assistance to students at
private and tax-supported institu-
tions.

 

The new science building, which
will cost approximately $1,500,000,
will house the biology, physics, and
pre-engineering departments. The
new dorm, costing about $500,000
will have 26 double rooms and 39
singles in addition to a 15-bed in-
firmary.

Work on the science building,
which is slightly behind schedule, is
being pushed. The dorm construction
is running according to time-table.
Brady said “we hope they will be on
schedule.”

The classroom hall is being built
at the same time as an addition to
adjacent Howe Hall which will add
30 per cent capacity to Howe. A
terrace will connect the two build-
ings. Brady said that the Howe An-
nex, which at present is used for
laboratories, will probably be used
by the maintenance department.

Innovations included in the con-
struction are an observatory in the
Howe addition, a greenhouse on the
top classroom level of the new build-
ing, darkrooms, and an X-ray room
for the study of crystals. Projected
improvements are a seismograph and
an artificial stream for the study of
erosion. Housing only a few class-
rooms, the new building will include
many labs, libraries for each depart-
ment, and research rooms.

The new dorm is double the size

Barritt Attends
Language Forum

Dr. Westbrook Barritt, associate
professor of romance languages was
one of four panelists December 30
for an open forum of the National
Federation of Modern Language
Teachers Associations.

 

The special meeting was held in
the Palmer House in Chicago. The
topic for discussion was “Modern
Foreign Languages and Their Teach-
ing.”

Other panelists were Dr. W.
Wright Kirk, Dickinson College; Dr.
Solomon Lipp, Boston University;
and Dr. R. Ross Macdonald, George-
town University.

A member of the Washington and
Lee faculty since 1952, Dr. Barritt’s
primary language is Spanish. He re-
ceived his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Virginia in 1952. He
received his undergraduate degree
from Washington and Lee. He also
has attended Lehigh and Harvard
Universities.

McCormick Library Adds
Modern Reading Room;
Capacity Increased to 300

Cyrus McCormick Library has
added an additional reading room
to its study facilities. The refurnish-
ed room has a seating capacity of
sixty students, increasing the total
library capacity from two-hundred-
forty students to an even three

hundred.

The room, on the second floor at
the head of the stairs, has been fur-
nished and shelved since last sum-
mer. A young alumnus, formerly an
assistant librarian, custom built the
new furniture. The painting was
completed before the University
opened its current session.

In the library remodeling of 1941,
the Alumni Association had plans
to establish a memorial browsing
room here, However, World War II
intervened, and it never served that
purpose. It has served as an art
gallery, and as a press conference
room for Harry Truman when he
was at Lexington for the Mock Con-
vention.

Now its bright new fluorescent
lights welcome sixty conscientious
students.

Debaters Enter
ACC Contest

By MALCOLM MORRIS

Washington and Lee’s debating
Team faces “the best teams in the
South” today and tomorrow in the
Atlantic Coast Conference Tourna-
ment at Duke University, Durham,
North Carolina.

Sophomores Bill Noell and Al
Eckes, state champion negative team,
have shifted to the affirmative side
for this debate. Soph Dick McEnally
and senior Robin Wood will debate
the negative side of this proposal.
The question is “Resolved, that labor
organizations should be under the
jurisdiction of antitrust legislation.”

Washington and Lee is the only
school in the group of six entrants
not a member of the Atlantic Coast
Conference. The five ACC schools
participating are South Carolina,
North Carolina, Wake Forest, Duke,
and Virginia. W&L debate coach
William Chaffin noted, “This is a
highly selective tournament in which
we will face the best teams in the
South.”

Washington and Lee captured sec-
ond place in both affirmative and
negative divisions in last year’s ACC
tournament.

Wood will also represent the
school in an “impromptu” speech
contest. Contestants will draw topics
and will have 45 minutes to pre-
pare their speeches.

Monday afternoon Chaffin will
send a team to Hampden-Sydney
for a dual meet. Two teams from
Washington and Lee will debate
both sides of the question in the
meet. Representing W&L will be
Steve Smith, Malcolm Morris, Ed
Norton, and Barry Staniar. Norton
and Staniar will experience their
first intercollegiate debating on the
trip.

FD Costumes

Go On Sale

For Last Time

Costumes for the 1961 Fancy Dress
Ball will go on sale for the last time
next week, announced Dance Board
vice president Frank Young. The
costumes will be available in the
Student Union from 9:00 a.m. until
5:00 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday,
January 10 and 11.

The rental price for the complete
costume is $10. Students may pay
for them by cash or check when they
rent them, but do not have to pay
until the costumes are picked up in
February.

Young says that student interest
in the Fancy Dress Ball has in-
creased significantly. Last year only
280 costumes were rented; this year,
320 have already been sold and it is
estimated that many more will be
bought next week. Increased at-
tendance at the university dances
will enable the Dance Board to pro-
vide better and better entertain-
ment for them and continue with
plans to improve the dance sets in
other ways, such as holding the
dances in the Evans Dining Hall.

In keeping with the theme of the
weekend, the costumes will be full
dress for the men and formal eve-
ning gowns for the ladies. Also, for
the first time, the Commons will be
available for the dance.

The Ball will be held Friday night,
February 2, from 9 p.m. to 1 am.
The jazz Concert, featuring Dave
Brubeck, will be in the Doremus
Gymnasium between 3 and 5 p.m.
on Saturday, February 3. That night
Si Zentner and his orchestra will
provide the music for a dance be-
tween 8 p.m. and midnight.

The change in the hours of the
Saturday night dance is to facilitate
the scheduling of fraternity house
parties. The fraternities have agreed
to hold their evening combo parties
between 9:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. in
order to avoid some of the usual
conflict between university and fra-
ternity events.

Dress for the Concert and Satur-
day dance will be conventional.

The formation of a new athletic conference among Centre
College of Kentucky, Southwestern at Memphis, the University
of the South, and Washington and Lee was announced here
today by President Fred C. Cole.

President Cole said the new organization will be known as
The College Athletic Conference and will become operational

in 1962-63.

The conference will sponsor inter-*

collegiate competition in football,
basketball, golf, tennis, track and
field, and baseball. Other sports may
be added later, President Cole said.

Under the conference’s Articles of
Organization, a “cardinal principle”
of the league is “that all participa-
tion in sports by members of its
teams shall be solely because of
interest in and the enjoyment of the
game.”

“No financial aid shall be given
to any student which is conditioned
upon, or for the purpose of en-
couraging, his participation in inter-
collegiate sports,” the articles state.
“All financial aids of the member
institutions shall be administered by
a single agency of the faculty. No
aid funds shall be specifically re-
served for athletes, and the directors
of athletics and coaches shall have
no voice in participation in the de-
termination of recipients or amounts
of financial aid to any student.
Criteria for admission to the individ-
ual member institutions shall be the
same for all students.”

The conference will be governed

In The News

Dr. Gaines In The Times

From the Rockbridge County News

The name of Dr. Francis P. Gaines,
Chancellor of Washington and Lee,
appeared beside names of leaders of
nations in the New York Times
Magazine’s selection of the year’s
outstanding quotations last Sunday.

The magazine feature was entitled
“Anno Domini 1961—In Quotes.”

Under the heading “World Af-
fairs,” the quotation by Dr. Gaines
states, “War, with its tidal waves
of destruction, slaughter and grief,
is the answer to no human problem,
and it is an insult to the intelligence
that God gave us that we cannot
find other answers.”

Dr. Gaines’ quotation was taken
from a Civil War centennial address
which he gave in the National Ca-
thedral last February.

The only other persons quoted on
the subject of world affairs were
President Kennedy, Sir Anthony
Eden, Premier Khrushchev, Bertrand
Russell, President Eisenhower, Pope
John XXIII and French statesman

Jean Monnet.

Defenders Back Board

Richmond—tThe Defenders of State
Sovereignty and Individual Liber-
ties gave its approval here Saturday
to the action of the Washington and
Lee University Board of Trustees in
refusing to let a desegregation leader
speak at the school.

A student group at Washington
and Lee recently wanted to invite
the Rev. Martin Luther King to
speak at a meeting, but the action
was overruled by the School’s board
of trustees.

The Defenders voted approval to
the board for refusing “the use of its

 

school as a forum and _ prestige-
builder for one who has been very
actively associated with commun-
nists...”

by a Board of Directors composed of
the presidents of the member insti-
tutions. The chairmanship will be
rotated among the directors at their
discretion. Vice Chancellor and
President Edward McCrady of the
University of the South will be the
Board’s first chairman. Other mem-
bers are President Thomas A. Sprag-
ens of Centre, President Peyton N.
Rhodes of Southwestern, and Presi-
dent Cole.

Additional members may be ad-
mitted to the conference upon unan-
imous approval of the Board of Di-
rectors.

While the four founding members
are all Southern institutions, Presi-
dent Cole said it was not the in-
tention of the Board to limit the
conference geographically. He said
other colleges and universities in the
East and Midwest could become
members.

An administrative council com-
posed of representatives of each
school will handle scheduling and
other routine annual business. The
council is authorized to conduct an
annual basketball tournament and
annual meets in the spring sports.
Other sports can be added to the
conference program at the council’s
discretion, and the council will de-
cide how champions in each sport
will be determined.

The Articles of
States:

“It shall be the general purpose
of the Conference to foster compe-
tition in as many sports as may be
successfully provided by the mem-
bers within the limits of budget cap-
abilities. A major objective shall
be the encouragement of widespread
participation in healthful sports by
members of their various student
bodies.”

The articles provide no conference
rules on eligibility as such. They
state, “It is assumed that all mem-
ber institutions will permit partici-
pation on their athletic teams only
to regular, full-time students in
good standing as defined by the
regulations of their respective facul-
ties.”

“Each member institution has full
respect for the integrity of the other
members, for the selective nature
of their admission standards, and for
their existing standards of academic
qualification,” the articles declare.

All members of the new confer-
ence have had previous conference
affiliation. Centre was a member of
the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference until 1945, and from
1946 to 1959, the college participated
in the Kentucky Intercollegiate Ath-
letic Conference in basketball only.
Southwestern also once belonged
to the Southern Intercollegiate Ath-
letic Conference, and for five years
was a member of the Dixie Confer-
ence, withdrawing in 1940.

The University of the South,
known better in athletic circles as
Sewanee, was a charter member of
the Southeastern Conference until
1939. Washington and Lee was a
charter member of the Southern
Conference and ended its affiliation
with that group in 1958.

The four teams have been propon-
ents of non-subsidized athleties for
many years. Southwestern hasn't
given an athletic scholarship since
1942, Centre and Sewanee gave up
athletic grants-in-aid in 1946, and
Washington and Lee began its non-
subsidized program in 1954.

All four schools boast rich athletic
histories, and all four have pro-
duced outstanding teams in various
sports since adopting current sports
policies.

A Cautious Step Forward

The new College Athletic Conference in which Washington
and Lee has joined with Sewanee, Centre, and Southwestern
should prove a marked improvement over our present inde-
pendent status, on the whole. There are drawbacks readily ap-
parent to anyone who has taken an interest in athletics at
Washington and Lee, but further thought should reveal that
it is the best thing that we can do at this time.

The conference will certainly be a disappointment to
people who hoped that Washington and Lee could take the
lead in a conference which would draw Virginia, Davidson, and
William and Mary into the non-subsidized ranks. That hope
has proven a long-range one because each of these other
schools has alumni and an athletic staff who oppose such a
move. More eligible candidates for the new conference, such
as Randolph-Macon, Hampden-Sydney, and Davidson also
must have been at least approached when the conference was
being formed. They, too, must have felt that they were unable
to go along at present with the program which prevails at
W&L and the other founders. We can surmise, then, that the
four schools who have founded the new conference were the
only ones within hundreds of miles who were prepared for
such a move.

Problems For New Members

And yet the formation of the conference could wait until
eight or ten schools saw the light and were converted to our
type of program. Only a flourishing conference will provide
a refuge for schools who want to go through the painful transi-
tion from subsidized athletics to our type of program. President
Cole and the others have shown a great deal of wisdom in not
setting down specific rules for membership. The conference is
based on mutual trust and respect that the members have for
each other’s integrity. This element will, however, present a
problem to new members, for it forces them to work their own
program in a manner satisfactory to the present members with-
out providing a detailed program as a guideline. Hampden-
Sydney, Randolph-Macon, Johns Hopkins, and Franklin and
Marshall of the schools we now have regular athletic relations
with, could probably join the conference rather quickly and
easily, if they were of a mind to. This would be another matter,
however, for Davidson or William and Mary, with their present
programs. It would probably take several years for them to
settle down into a program that satisfied them.

The conference will provide more spirited competition
among the four schools which make it up and should not de-
tract from our competition with the rest of our schedules.

But the conference does not seem to us to be a good final
solution of the problem of schedueling good athletic competi-
tion. We hope that the University will not become satisfied with
the level of our athletic competition. It could be quite a bit bet-
terer. If competition is the main goal, we should not be afraid to
play subsidized teams. What if they are tainted? We are mainly
interested in whether or not we can beat them. We would hate
to see W&L draw into a little “amateur” world of its own.

Level Of Competition Needs Raising

We still think that the best way for us to bring Davidson,
Virginia, and William and Mary around to our way of think-
ing is to show that we can maintain a high level of competi-
tion wthout compromising our integrity or our academic stand-
ards. We will never do it if we are satisfied with our present
competition.

Many people have looked to Washington and Lee to start
a trend toward desubsidization throughout the South. Sewanee,
Southwestern, and Centre have rich athletic histories and have
proven worthy opponents for us since we desubsidized. We
may expect spirited competition from them in the new con-
ference. But they are too small, and too far away to provide the
full range of competition that most people expect from a con-
ference. We should not gear our athletic program to their
standards. In most sports, except football and basketball, we
can maintain Southern Conference and Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence levels of competition, given good coaches, and adequate
facilities.

We think that a young man who is an athlete will choose
a college where he can participate in the best intercollegiate
competition of which he is capable. Good athletes run just as
smart as mediocre ones. It should be our aim to have them at
W&L. But if they can get just as good an education at U.Va.,
ot Davidson, or Princeton, and play ball in a better league, it’s
a pretty good bet that they won’t come here.

We think the conference will be an excellent thing until
we pull our athletic standards up. Until then, we shouldn’t let
the fun we’re having on those fancy plane trips to Tennessee
detract from our primary goal to make Washington and Lee a
respected name in intercollegiate sports.

An Interview With Dr. Colvin

 

President Kennedy’s First Year

By TRACY HARRINGTON

After a hectic and eventful year
as president, John F. Kennedy’s
popularity is at an all time high—
about 80%, which is higher than
that of ex-president Eisenhower’s at
any time during his eight year term.

Dr. Milton Colvin, associate pro-
fessor of political science, is a Ken-
nedy man. He supported Kennedy
“before the convention, after the
convention, and still supports him.”

After he was defeated for Con-
gress in the Democratic Primary in
1960 in Montana, Dr. Colvin worked
helping to set up Citizens for Ken-
nedy groups. In the summer of 1960
he headed the state organization for
Kennedy in Montana. In August,
1960, he had to choose between
working fulltime with Ted Kennedy
in the Northwestern campaign or
teaching at the University of Chi-
cago. He chose “the academic life.”

What does this man—an obviously
qualified judge—think of Kennedy’s
first year as chief executive?

“I do not think he has done every-
thing well, but I think he has done
most things well, and that is pretty
good these days,” he said.

Discussing Kennedy’s popularity,
Dr. Colvin pointed out that “person-
al popularity is not to be confused
with popularity for presidential pro-
grams.”

New Push for Old Issues

He added, however, that Kennedy
managed to push though Congress
most of the legislation that he want-
ed, and that the new Congress will
see “attempts by the White House
to get though Congress legislation
that did not make it previously.” He
cited financial aid for the aged,
federal aid to education and lowered
tariffs as examples.

Kennedy, according to Dr. Col-
vin, has proved himself to be a
moderate in office. “President Ken-
nedy has not asked for any further
civil rights legislation and he has
not pressed for an anti-discrimina-
tion policy in the field of housing.
In short, he has been paying very
little attention to the ADA (an ex-
treme left-wing organization).”

Dr. Colvin believes that the Ken-
nedy administration has demonstrat-
ed that it is not anti-business, “for
America has just come through a
highly prosperous year.”

 

According to Dr. Colvin, what the
Kennedy administration has done in
the world of business is “to ask busi-
ness to live up to its profound be-
lief in free enterprise by (a) not
rigging prices and (b) taking its
chance in open competition with
foreign trade.”

“Free Enterprise Man”

Dr. Colvin said that “those who
scream the most about free enter-
prise are those who want to con-
tinue rigging prices and seek pro-
tection through tariffs.’ He added
that “Mr. Kennedy is more a free
enterprise man than some of his
critics.”

On the topic of unemployment,
Dr. Colvin said the problem of a high
rate of unemployment “still nags us.”
He added, though, that this is more
of a social problem than a political
one, entailing re-training unskilled
laborers made jobless by automation.

“Government, industry, and labor
are all working on this problem,” he
said. “But it will take time before
results can be seen. It isn’t going
to happen overnight.

Discussing President Kennedy’s
appointees, Dr. Colvin said the chief
executive “has made the term ‘in-
tellectual’ no longer a nasty word.
He goes out of his way to bring
scholars into government, and to
give them a chance to exercise their
knowledge in policy-making deci-
sions. This is healthy as long as it
isn’t overdone.”

The Catholic Question

A Roman Catholic himself, Dr.
Colvin commended the policy of
Kennedy on the aid to parochial
schools issue. “Many protestants
genuinely feared that a Catholic
president would take orders from
the Catholic hierarchy. The strong
stand Kennedy ha staken on the
school issue against such men as
Cardinal Spellman has made it clear
to doubting protestants that a Cath-
olic is under no obligation to agree
with the hishops of the church on
politics or education.”

Turning from Kennedy on the
domestic scene to Kennedy in for-
eign affairs, Dr. Colvin said that
there is a “genuine feeling with the
exception of the Cuban fiasco, that
Mr. Kennedy is keeping the country
on an even course in international
issues.”

 

Dr. Colvin praised Kennedy for
having won the respect of Khurh-
chev for being a “tough man.”

The Cuban Fiasco

On the Cuban issue, Dr. Colvin
disaggreed with Kennedy. He said
that we should have supplied what-
ever force necessary “to topple Cas-
tro.” But, he said, “that is water
over the dam now.”

Concerning Berlin, Kennedy has
made it clear, Dr. Colvin said, that
we are going to stay. “And this has
obviously gotten through to Khrush-
chev. Certainly he (Khrushchev)
has become less bellicose and less
anxious to force a showdown in
Berlin.”

Kennedy appreciates, according to
Dr. Colvin, that “to pull out of Ber-
lin would mean the collapse of
NATO and communist domination
of Europe.”

The administration’s policy in the
Far East reflects the attitudes of
most Americans, says the ex-Mon-
tana politician. “While Americans
are willing to take a strong stand
in Europe, they are less willing to
take it in Asia—and this is Ken-
nedy’s approach.”

Southeast Asia

He added that none of the anti-
communist countries of Southeast
Asia “are really very democratic
as we understand the word demo-
cratic.”

Dr. Colvin said that what we are
having to do in the East is “choose
between the lesser of two evils. A
good example of this is South Viet
Nam.”

On the subject of the common
market, Dr. Colvin said Kennedy has
made it clear we won’t join. “The
Common market will, however, force
us to produce better goods. We will
be in competition with the best
craftsmen and artisans of Europe,
and no longer will we be able to
turn out some of the shoddy goods
that we have in the past.”

Dr. Colvin believes that “there is
no indication” the administration
has any intention of joining the
Common Market.

In summation, Dr. Colvin said, “I
like a man who is young, vigorous,
has been shot at in war, who
is educated, and who knows where
he is going. This pretty much char-
acterizes John Kennedy.”

 

Pity Our Poor Youth! They

ve Analyzed

And Classified, Right And Not-So-Right

By HOWARD SLATER

This is an historical period in
which we live—historical, that is, in
that it is significantly eventful. And
if there will be an opportunity for
our time to be observed in retro-
spect, then it, or an event during
its duration, will probably be singled
out as “crucial” or as a “turning
point.” Both crucial, and turning
point, do not necessarily have to
mean very much, except as part of
historical or journalistic jargon, but
we generally accept them as de-
scriptive of changes in destiny.

When these changes affect the
human race—to which we sometimes
admit a sentimental kinship—then
it is no wonder that we are referred
to as a Generation of Destiny. This,
more than the fact that this is an
age of criticism, is the reason for
the many analyses and autopsies on
on Youth. The latest exclusive and
revealing insight into the nature of
the present-day youth has appeared
in the Saturday Evening Post. Life
and Look, among others, have re-
cently had a go at it, trying to come
up with a cute label for us, to
match such pearls as the Lost Gen-
eration, the Depressed Generation
(or whatever they were called in
the 30’s), and the Silent Generation.

Hollywood Analysts

Speaking not necessarily as a
spokesman for this decade of young
people, but at least as a member of
the group, I resent this category-
seeking. Analysis in itself is not a
bad thing. It can certainly help us
to understand ourselves and see if
and how we differ from our prede-
cessors at a comparable stage of de-
velopment. But those who are ana-
lysing us en masse are not fit for
the job. Probably they have been

 

too influenced by Hollywood myths
and the very same garbage which
they now issue forth for the afore-
mentioned magazines and others like
them.

That we are not, on the whole, in-
clined to be romantically dreamy in
the Hollywood or Victorian fashion
is probably the one basic difference
between ourselves and our prede-
cessors—and even that is not too
definite, for our immediate predeces-
sors had the Depression and World
War II from which to spin out their
bile. In most respects, though, hu-
mans are basically the same from
decade to decade. This is what is be-
ing overlooked in the rush to pin
a label on us.

Our elders seem to be amazed
at the knowledgeability of the
young generation. But I am con-
vinced that there is no such thing.
It is concentrated mostly among
college students. Even then, most of
us are really only opinionated, be-
cause of our contact with current
developments through newspapers,
radio and television. Youth pretty
much has its mind made up, with-
out giving reasons why. There is no
reason to believe that we are think-
ing logically and causatively. (I do
not mean to be pompous. Please
notice the “we.”)

Percentages Misused

But the interesting aspect about
this labeling is the way in which
young people are transformed into
percentages. Also, it seems, youths
are either for something, or they
don’t exist. As an example, say that
it is determined (don’t ask how) that
85 per cent of us Twist. In that case,
the other 15 per cent, presumably,
doesn’t—or if it does, is in some
Twistless limbo. Our elders do not

 

take the dissenters among us into
account. This is an _ unfortunate
oversight, since they are probabbly
the future decision-makers of our
generation.

That is why the importance of the
minority groups which have emerg-
ed recently, and whic hthe New
York Times calls “the Rampageous
Right,” cannot be minimized. Al-
though they are dissenters, and in
the minority, they are possible de-
cision-makers in their potential in-
fluence upon the more stable ele-
ments in our society.

“Romantic Cure-allers”

It is a personal observation that
these right-wing groups are in the
60’s what the left-wingers were in
in the 30’s—romantic cure-allers.
There is no easy way to solve our
problems and the world’s. For this
reason ,sometimes even the less ex-
treme conservatives have to be in-
cluded as cure-allers, when they
seek solutions by “standing pat.”
Things were better in the old days,
and if we can’t go back then let’s
not cause any more trouble by go-
ing ahead. This, of course, is a nega-
tive cure-all, and another romantic
illusion.

Last year, Newsweek reported, in
another attempt to fathom the young
generation’s orientation, that there
was a definite movement to the right
in collge ranks. This year, the Post
says that this is not true. I hope it
is not. If we are a generation of
destiny, perplexed with a situation
which mankind may not survive,
then we must stay in the middle,
veering neither to left nor right. We
must be realistic. If, as I suggested
before, or generation is not duped
by the illusion of romance, then we
will be realistic.

Behind The News

The announcement of the new
College Athletic Conference natur-
ally gives rise to speculation on
nick names to be used by the news-
papers. “The Fearsome Foursome”
has been knocked around the print
shop for several days. Someone else
has suggested “The Play-for-Fun
Four.”

Frank Parsons, who ought to
know, says that the new conference
will be called “The Ivory League.”
Why? “It’s “It’s 99 and 44/100 per

cent pure.”

The former deadline was 11:00

W&L Resumes BKB
Action Here Saturday

By STEVE HENRY
Washington and Lee’s varsity basketballers get back into
action after an extended holiday break when they meet Lynch-
burg College in Doremus Gymnasium tomorrow night. Game

time is 8.

Head coach Bob McHenry’s Generals are looking for the

win that will even their seaso

current campaign.
Big

“They've got one of the biggest
frontlines we'll meet,” said McHenry.
“We've got to outhustle them on the
boards if we’re going to win.”

Lynchburg has the biggest indi-
vidual player that'll appear in Do-
remus this year, 6’7” Charles Miller.

Also up front will be 63” Fred
Lanford and 6’5” Arthur Poindexter.

Lynchburg’s record this year in-
cludes a win over RPI and losses to
Randolph-Macon and MHampden-
Sydney, both excellent teams.

Defense

McHenry has stressed defense in
the four-day preparation for the
Lynchburg game.

In the Generals’ last action, an
86-79 win over Franklin and Mar-
shall, a loose W&L defense almost
offset an outstanding team offen-
sive offort.

“We can’t expect to score that
many points too often,” said Mc-
Henry. “And we certainly can’t give
up that many points and expect to
win.”

Man-to-Man

McHenry said he’ll send his guards
into an aggressive man-to-man, in
which the ball-handler will be
picked up at half court.

He'll keep the forwards back as
much as possible to give the Gen-
erals better rebounding strength
against the taller Hornets.

“Lynchburg has two fast, hustling
guards,” he said. “They like to fast
break. We've got to stop them and
force mistakes.”

McHenry will go with the same
starting line-up that stopped Frankl-
lin and Marshall.

That will be Tom Supac and
Louie Paterno at guards, Bip Faub-
er and Bill Ide at forwards, and Bill
Smith in the pivot.

Fauber, Ide and Smith all played
their best games of the year against
the Diplomats.

Fauber got a game-high 31 points
and 23 rebounds; Ide got 20 points
and played an outstanding floor
game; and Smith got 13 rebounds
and several key assists.

 

Coach Mac Accepts Award

Head football coach Lee McLaugh-
lin will take a pleasant trip to
Washington on January 13 to ac-
cept the Washington Touchdown
Club’s “Outstanding Small College
Football Team” award for Washing-
ton and Lee.

Accompanying him will be the en-
tire General football coaching staff,

PikKA’s Take
First Defeat
In Wrestling

By HOWIE KORMAN

Last night the grapplers from DU
knocked PiKA from the ranks of the
unbeaten by gaining their first win
in three contests. DU received fif-
teen points early in the match by
forfeits, and then coasted to a
18-14 triumph.

Frosh Bob Patton earned the vic-
tors’ other three points by defeat-
ing his counterpart 6-3 in the 157
‘Ib. class. Winning on points for
PiKA were Chester White, Bruce
Houghton, and Conway Shield. The
other five markers were achieved by
freshman Andy Kilpatrick, by for-
feit.

Division Leaders

In Division A of the wrestling
league the Delts have a firm hold
on the top position with a record
of three wins and no defeats. ZBT,
Sigma Chi, and Sigma Nu are all
fighting for second place with each
having one victory in two contests.

Division B is slightly closer as
SPE holds first place with two wins
in the same number of contests.
The wrestlers from KA are not too
far behind with two wins and one
setback. The Betas and SAE have
yet to win a contest.

The representatives from Phi Gam
defeated their three opponents to
date to remain undefeated in Di-
vision C. Phi Kap, which has one of
the highest number of total points in
I-M play, has a record of two and
one, but has been beaten by the
league leaders earlier this season.

In Division D. the grapplers from
Phi Psi have a perfect record and
have the strength to finish the sea-
son undefeated. They have defeated
DU and KS, having to face only
PiKA on January 11.

Basketball
On January 4 I-M basketball re-
sumed with Sigma Nu, Sigma Chi,

and SAE emerging with victories.
In the Sigma Nu contest, Paul

Delts Hold Slim Lead In Intra-Murals

Delta Tau Delta holds a slim lead
in intramural athletic competition,
but seven other houses are within
50 points of the leaders.

In sports completed before the
Christmas holidays, the Delts built
up an impressive overall total of
405 points out of a possible 500.

Events counting on scoring so
far are football, turkey trot, swim-
ming, tennis and golf.

Trailing the Delts by only seven
points are two houses deadlocked
for second place, the Pi Kappa Sigs
and the PiKA’s, both with 398 points.

Sigma Chi, with 389 points, Sigma
Phi Epsilon, with 385 points, Phi
Delta Theta, with 367 points, Sigma
Nu, with 361 points, and Delta Up-
silon, with 355 points, round out the
leaders.

Intramural basketball, handball,
bowling and wrestling are currently
underway.

8-0-0 season. Southwestern’s 1938
Lynx defeated Mississippi State on
the way to a record 7-1-1, the best
in school history. In 1955, the Lynx
were 6-2, with one of the losses
against Centre’s fine team.

Sewanee recorded an athletic fete
unparalleled in football history in
1899 when the Tigers’ greatest team
won 12, lost none. Among the vic-
tories were five wins in six days
over Texas, Texas A&M, Tulane,
Louisiana State, and Mississippi
while the team covered 3,000 miles
on the trip. In 1958, the Tigers again
boasted a perfect season of eight
wins, no losses.

Washington and Lee had a “golden
age” of football in 1914-16, which in-
cluded a 9-0-0 season , but the
schools most recent best effort in
major college competition was in
1950 with an 8-2-0 mark and an
appearance in the ’Gator Bowl on
January 1, 1951. The Generals are
currently undefeated in 19 consecu-
tive games and were 9-0-0 in 1961.

Two of the new conference’s mem-
bers are co-educational institutions.
Centre has an enrollment of 471 stu-
dents, about half of them women.
Southwestern’s 812 students include
394 women.

Sewanee’s current enrollment is
722 students, including 72 in the
university’s theological seminary.
Washington and Lee lists 1,186 stu-
dents with 130 of these law students
who seldom participate in inter-
collegiate athletics.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Ambitious VMI Developing Fast

By BILL BOWEN

(Editor’s note—We think that this
article on VMI, which Bill Bowen
wrote as part of his regular course
work in the journalism department,
might be of interest to the Wash-
ington and Lee Community, because
of the close proximity of the two
Lexington campuses.)

In keeping with the tradition of
expansion and improvement that has
prevailed at the Virginia Military
Institute since its founding in 1939,
VMI has entered 1962 with a six-
year program designed to provide
expanded physical, recreational and
intellectual facilities for a corps
which, since World War II, has in-
creased by one-third to its present
size of 1,050.

The six-year development pro-
gram is designed to meet existing
needs of the present corps and to
provide for a modest increase in stu-
dents by 1964.

Included in the development plan
are a new administration building—
administrative facilities at present
are located in scattered areas and a
part of needed library and barracks
space is being used for offices—a
recerational center for use by the

cadets, rehabilitation and enlarge-
ment of several academic buildings,
improvement and expansion of cur-
rently-inadequate out-of-doors phy-
sical training and athletic areas, ad-
ditional faculty housing and a sus-
tained program of broadened aca-
demic essentials through library and
departmental acquisitions.

Funds for some of the proposed
improvements will be requested in
the budget which VMI will submit
to the forthcoming General Assemb-
ly.

Although improvement is certain-
ly the key word for the future plans
of the Institute, she need not be
ashamed of the past; for looking
back on a year of academic achieve-
ment VMI can boast of four top
national and academic awards cap-
tured by graduating Cadets—a
Rhodes Scholarship, two Woodrow
Wilson Fellowships and a Danforth
Fellowship.

Still other graduates have gone on
to further their education in such
fields as history, law, English and
medicine.

A highlight of 1961 was the inaug-
uration in May of Major General
George R. E. Shell as the ninth
superintendent of the Institute. Gen-
eral Shell succeeded Major General
William H. Milton, who resigned in
1960.

Among steps taken last year to
strengthen the academic program
was the institution of a “quality
standard system” which upgraded on
an average basis overall require-
ments necessary to advance from
one class to another and to graduate.

VMI also benefited by the acquisi-
tion of a sub-critical nuclear reactor,
purchased for use by the physics
department with a grant from the
Atomic Energy Commission.

Various research and writing pro-
jects were engaged in by members

of the faculty during the year. “Let-|

killed at New Market during the
Civil War, was the result of a
collaboration between Lt. Col. John
Barrett, of the history department,
and Major Robert Turner, of the
English department.

Lt. Col. Louis R. Hundley, of the
biology department, is currently
engaged in a project, with the aid of
funds from the U.S. Public Health
Service, designed to explore the
physiological changes in bone and
muscle which come about when ex-
ercise and fat loads are reduced.

A project concerning fuses is be-
ing carried on by the physics de-
partment and other faculty members
during the year contributed articles
to various publications.

The Institute also sponsored sev-
eral special events in which the pub-
lic participated. In May, more than
800 persons assembled at the Insti-
tute for the four-day annual session
of the Virginia Academy of Science
and the Junior Academy of Science.
The fifteenth annual meeting in
October of the Virginia Highway
Conference attracted several hun-
dred more.

The Institutes already-renowned
military side was presented to the
public on two special occasions—the
presidential inaugural parade in
January in which the corps of cadets
won first place among marching
units, and the observance in Virginia
of the Civil War Centennial.

Virginia Military Institute’s his-
toric part in the Civil War was re-
called when the cadet first captain
presented Virginia’s Governor J.
Lindsay Almond with a letter ad-
vising him that the Institute stands
ready for duty today as it did a
century ago when the cadets filed

 

out of barracks and set out for ac-
tive military service under Stonewall
Jackson.

have running water, but will not
be as luxurious as those of the other
new dorms.

The infirmary will be connected to
the school physician’s office in Davis

will be no lounge in the building.
Names for the buildings have not
as yet been decided upon, but
Treasurer E. S. Mattingly conjec-

either Graham or Lee. These were
once the names of the wings of the
present freshman dorm, before they
were connected over the archway.
Now the names may be used to
designate the separate dorms.

RING IN THE NEW

Are you still writing “1961” on your papers and letters? I'll
bet you are, you scamps! But I am not one to be harsh with
those who forget we are in a new year, for I myself have long
been guilty of the same lapse. In fact, in my senior year at
college, I wrote 1873 on my papers until nearly November of
1874! (It turned out, incidentally, not to be such a serious
error because, as we all know, 1874 was later repealed by
President Chester A. Arthur in a fit of pique over the Black
Tom Explosion. And, as we all know, Mr. Arthur later came
to regret his hasty action. Who does not recall that famous
meeting between Mr. Arthur and Louis Napoleon when Mr.
Arthur said, “Lou, I wish I hadn’t of repealed 1874.” Where-
upon the French emperor made his immortal rejoinder, “Tipi
que nous et tyler tu.” Well sir, they had many a good laugh
about that, as you can imagine.)

But T digress. How can we remember to write 1962 on our
papers and letters? Well sir, the best way is to find something
memorable about 1962, something unique to fix it firmly in
your mind. Happily, this is very simple because, as we all know,
1962 is the first year in history that is divisible by 2, by 4, and
by 7. Take a pencil and try it: 1962 divided by 2 is 981; 1962
divided by 4 is 490-1 /2; 1962 divided by 7 is 280-2/7.This mathe-
matical curiosity will not occur again until the year 2079, but
we will all be so busy then celebrating the Chester A. Arthur

 

Namo

ie a),

well’ el ee

bi-centenary that we will scarcely have time to be writing
papers and letters and like that.

Another clever little trick to fix the year 1962 in your mind
is to remember that 1962 spelled backwards is 2691. ‘Year’
spelled backwards is “raey.” “Marlboro” spelled backwards is
“oroblram.”’ Marlboro smoked backwards is no fun at all.
Kindly do not light the filter. What you do is put the filter end
in your lips, then light the tobacco end, then draw, and then
find out what pleasure, what joy, what rapture serene it is to
smoke the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste. In 1962, as
in once and future years, you'll get a lot to like in a Marlboro
available in soft pack and flip-top box in all 50 states and
Duluth.

But I digress. We were speaking of the memorable aspects
of 1962 and high among them, of course, is the fact that in
1962 the entire House of Representatives stands for election.
There will, no doubt, be many lively and interesting contests,
but none, I'll wager, quite so lively and interesting as the one
in my own district where the leading candidate is none other
than Chester A. Arthur!

Mr. Arthur, incidentally, is not the first ex-president to come
out of retirement and run for the House of Representatives.
John Quiney Adams was the first. Mr. Adams also holds
another distinction: he was the first son of a president ever to
serve as president. It is true that Martin Van Buren’s son,
Walter “Blinky” Van Buren, was at one time offered the nomi-
nation for the presidency, but he, alas, had already accepted
a bid to beeome Mad Ludwig of Bavaria. James K. Polk’s son,
on the other hand, became Salmon P. Chase. Millard Fill-
more’s son went into air conditioning. This later was known as
the Missouri Compromise.

© 1962 Max Shulman

* 1" *

In Missouri, or anywhere else, there is no compromise with
quality in Marlboro or the new unfiltered king-size Philip
Morris Commander. The Commander does something new
in cigarette making—gently vacuum cleans the tobacco for
flavor and mildness. Get aboard! You'll be welcome.

IFC Offers ‘Help’ Proposals

- -s

ACTION COMES AFTER DETAILED STUDY OF OTHER PROGRAMS

The IFC adopted the first
draft of a new proposal provid-
ing for changes and revisions
in Help Week. At a meeting
last night the body accepted

the proposals offered by a sub-com-
mitttee.

The committee was formed to in-
vestigate ways to stop Hell Week
abuses and devise a plan of enforce-
ment. Before the proposals were pre-
sented, efforts were made to learn
how other schools handled the prob-
lem.

Steve Rutledge, chairman of the
committee, stated that the proposal
was “founded upon striving to bring
forth a new philosophy toward pledge
training and, in particular, ‘Help
Week’.

“Tt is a constructive attempt to bring
about a more responsible and mature
attitude in regard to this phase of
fraternity life.”

The other members of the committee
are Bill Outman, Jim Gwinn, Tom
Luthy, Rupert Johnson, and Bob
Doenges.

The first draft as accepted in last
night’s meeting is as follows:

1. A week of concentrated pledge
activities will continue to exist.

2. While carrying out these activi-
ties that bind a freshman to his

Fernac Nagy, former Prime
Minister of Hungary, will
speak to Washington and Lee
students tonight at 8 in duPont

Hall auditorium.

Nagy, who is presently chairman-
president of the Assembly of Captive
European Nations, will speak on the
“Situation in Cen-
tral-Eastern Eu-
rope.”

His visit to W&L,
which is sponsored
by the department
of journalism
and communica-
tions, will also in-

class in psychologi-
cal warfare and
. propaganda.
Nagy A native of
Bisse, Hungary, Nagy has become a
spokesman for the captive European
peoples since his exile from Hungary
in 1947.

Nagy was active in the Hungarian
Parliament since 1939, becoming presi-
dent of that body in 1945. In that year
he also became the country’s minis-
ter of reconstruction. He was a pris-
oner of the German Gestapo in 1944.

From 1946-47, he served as Hun-
gary’s Prime Minister from which po-
sition he was forced into exile. He now
makes his home in Herndon, Va.

Founder of the Smallholders’ Party
and the International Peasant Union,

 

Nagy has lectured at colleges through- |

out the nation.

His book, Struggle Behind the Iron
Curtain, was published in 1948. He is
also the author of numerous magazine
articles.

Nagy has also served as chairman
of the foreign relations section of the
Hungarian Committee, the exile poli-
tical organization embracing repre-
sentatives of the 1956 Revolution and
post-war democratic Hungarian per-
sonalities. The committee has as its
goal the independence of Hungary and
the restoration of freedom for its peo-
ple.

house, no individual should be
forced to perform deeds that violate
his basic sense of human dignity and
decency.

3. A “hazard” is clearly defined as
any clear and present danger of
harm to the physical or emotional
processes,

4. The highest purpose of Help
Week can be achieved through con-
structive activities for the pledges.

5. Each house must submit a plan
of its proposed pre-initiation activi-
ties to the Help Week Committee at
9:00 p.m. of the Sunday night prior
to the beginning of Help Week. All
House Presidents and Pledge Train-
ers are required to attend (this year
it will be February 3, at 9 p.m.).

6. A revolving trophy will be
awarded by the Help Week Commit-
tee to the pledge class achieving the
most constructive service for their
fraternity, community, and Univer-
sity.

Any violation of the rules alleged

 

by an upperclassman of a freshman
will be written up and submitted to
the judicial committee of the LF.C.
which will hear and investigate all
charges and then will decide the ap-
priate action.

Bob Doenges, president of the IFC,
expressed hope that the Student Body
would provide the support to make
the plan successful.

Following the meeting, president
Doenges stated that in light of the
hazing regulations that exist and the
proposals being made, he felt it his
prerogative and duty as IFC presi-
dent to inspect each house to see that
it is abiding by the rules responsibily.

The following rules governing the
handling of pledges below have been
passed by the IFC in the past.

1. No initiation or pledge training
activity shall constitute any physical
or emotional hazard to the individual.
Such potential hazards include the
“long walk,” dangerous physical ex-

Athletic Conference Draws Approval
From Both Coaches And Students

By DON WALLIS
Asst. Sports Editor

Washington and Lee’s recent decis-
ion to re-affiliate itself with an ath-
letic conference is meeting with the
hopeful approval of most persons
closely connected with the General
sports program.

Coaches and players have expressed
near-unanimous support of the decis-
ion, and all seem to agree that the
formation of the new College Athlet-
ic Conference—including, with W&L,
Sewanee and Southwestern of Tennes-
see and Centre College of Kentucky—
is a big step in the right direction for
Washington and Lee athletics.

Nearly everyone feels the new con-
ference should stimulate both player
and fan interest. As one veteran ath-
lete explained: “It’s pretty hard to get
excited about every game you play,
unless there is an extra significance
attached to the victory. For instance,
some of us were definitely not ‘up’ for
the Centre football game this year. If
we knew a win would move us up in
the conference, then we’d certainly be

  

 

fired up. We would play a lot better
and get more out of it.”

A basketball player echoed the
same general sentiments: “With study-
ing and everything, a basketball season
can get to be a long grind if you
don’t have a diversion, something to
keep your interest and desire up.
Meeting conference opponents does
this. And so does taking a long road
trip on a plane. It refreshes your entire
outlook and enables the player to en-
joy the game that much more.”

Coaches were also pleased with the
formation of the league. Many felt, as
did the players, that conference com-
petition would stimulate better per-
formances. And many of the mentors
feel that the conference will enable
them to recruit finer talent. “Con-
ference competition makes it possible
for both the team and the individual
to receive greater recognition than
possible under independent status. This
quite often means a lot to an athlete,”
said one coach.

But while expressing approval and
optimism over the formation of the

 

  

 

CAC, players and coaches alike added
some reservations. Many of them felt
the conference should be expanded, as
it almost certainly will be; but they
cautioned that the expansion should be
made carefully, with thoughtful con-
sideration of the quality and integrity
of schools admitted to the league.

And several coaches and players ex-
pressed concern over the expense in-
volved, their concern understandably
magnified by reports that several Vir-
ginia colleges declined to join the con-
ference due to the high traveling ex-
pense involved and that a school in
Austin, Texas, is being considered for
membership. Neither report has been
officially confirmed, however.

But, in general, Washington and
Lee’s athletic personnel are elated with
the prospects of competing in an ath-
letic conference. If handled properly,
they feel, the conference can be a
major factor in establishing Wash-
ington and Lee’s athletic system as one
of the finest amateur programs in col-
lege sports.

of admissions,” President Cole declar-
ed. “He has felt for some time that
his admissions work requires his full
attention. Following a careful study of
the matter, I have concurred in his
recommendation that the functions of
his office be divided and that he be
given opportunity for concentration
on admissions and the problems of re-
lationships between Washington and
Lee and secondary schools.”

As Dean of Students, Dr. Atwood
will be responsible administratively for
the further development of a healthy
balance among various facets of stu-
dent life at Washington and Lee, Pres-
ident Cole said.

“I am extremely pleased that Dr.
Atwood is rejoining the staff at
Washington and Lee,” Dean Gil-
liam said. “We know from his past
work here what a thoroughly com-
petent person he is. He has had
wide experience in working with
Washington and Lee students in
many and varied activities. I look
forward to close association and
close cooperation with him.”

Dr. Atwood will be assisted by Dr.
David W. Sprunt, who continues as
University Chaplain and Associate
Dean of Students.

Dr. Atwood, who is 39, is a native
of New York City and a graduate of
Princeton University where he earned
A.B., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. He
joined the Washington and Lee facul-
ty in 1952 as an assistant professor of

sociate professor in 1959.

As professor of economics, Dr. At-

to teaching in the University’s School
of Commerce and Administration,
President Cole said.

Dr. Atwood came to Washington

Dr. E. C. Atwood’s Return
Will Benefit University

The announcement made today by University President
Dr. Fred C. Cole that Dr. Edward C. Atwood will return to
Washington and Lee to serve as the new Dean of Students
comes to us as a pleasant and welcomed bit of news.

Dr. Atwood, who left W&L in 1960 to join General Elec-
tric, had formerly served the University as an associate profes-
sor of economics.

Dr. Atwood, a University press release states, will assume
his position February 1, and he will assume some of the duties
formerly the responsibility of Dean Frank J. Gilliam, Dean of
Students since 1931.

Dean Gilliam, a long and devoted friend of Washington
and Lee, will continue to serve the University, we are happy to
report, as Director of Admissions.

“Dr. Atwood’s appointment will make it possible for Dean
Gilliam to concentrate on the increasingly complex and im-
portant matter of admissions,” Dr. Cole said in the press an-
nouncement.

Dean Gilliam “‘has felt for some time,” he continues, ‘‘that
his admissions work requires his full attention. Following a care-
ful study of the matter, I have concurred in his recommeda-
tion that the functions of his office be divided and that he be
given opportunity for concentration on admissions and the
problems of relationships between Washington and Lee and
secondary schools.”’

It is the Tuesday Edition’s hope that Dr. Atwood will, as we
are sure he will, ably carry out his duties which are to be “‘re-
sponsible administratively for the further development of a
healthy balance among various facets of student life at Wash-
ington and Lee.”’ We hope, in addition, that Dr. Atwood will
enjoy the success that Dean Gilliam had as Dean of Students,
and we are confident that both Dr. Atwood and Dean Gilliam
will continue to be tremendous assets to the University. There
is no doubt in our minds as to their value as servants of Wash-
ington and Lee, for both men have distinguished themselves
with careers of which any man would be envious to covet.

Washington and Lee seems to have benefited twofold from
Dr. Atwood’s return here. First, as a qualified professor of
economics, Dr. Atwood will serve the Commerce School; sec-
ond, Dean Gilliam will be given more time to spend on the
growing job of admissions.

We are confident that Dr. Atwood will gain, if he has al-
ready not done so, the admiration and the respect of the Stu-
dent Body.

We can only hope that our new dean will (and we are sure
that he will) be ever cognizant of the importance of maintain-
ing good relations between the students, always keeping in mind
their welfare in all fields of college life, and with the University.

 

Two Events Feature Communism

Two events which will take place in the next six hours will
bring the general topic of Communism directly to the Wash-
ington and Lee community. The first event which should in-
terest the W&L Student Body is tonight’s appearance of Mr.
Feranc Nagy, a former Prime Minister of Hungary.

Mr. Nagy will speak at 8 p.m. tonight in duPont Auditoro-
ium on the subject of the “Situation In Central-Eastern Eu-
rope.” As current chairman-president of the Assembly of Cap-
tive European Nations, Mr. Nagy is well qualified to speak on
his selected topic.

The former government official left Hungary in exile in

1947. In 1946 and 1947 he served Hungary as her Prime|,

Minister. With this record of service to a country which rose
in revolt against the menace of Communism, tonight’s talk
should be both interesting and informing.

The second event which emphasizes Communism is today’s
publishing by the Tuesday Editions of the first of a ten-part
series on “Washington and Lee Looks At Communism.”

This series will be run weekly in the Tuesday Edition, and
is to be written by selected University professors.

Among topics that will be dealt with in the series are ‘“The
Russian Economy Of Today”’; ‘Russia And Her Foreign Pol-
icy;” “Communism and Propaganda”; ‘Russia’s Educational
System’’; and other such articles dealing with the major facets
of Russia’s every-day life.

It is not our intention in publishing this series to “brow-
beat” our readers about Communism, but we feel that our
goal is to present a look at Communism from a local viewpoint.
We hope that the publishing of this series will enlighten our
readers on this timely subject, and we further hope that our

Continutty And Change In Russia

 

Editor’s note: Dr. Thomas P. Hughes, Asso-
ciate Professor of History at Washington and
Lee since 1959, is, indeed, well qualified to write
on the general subject of Russian history. Join-
ing the staff of the University in 1956, Dr. Hughes
teaches a number of courses that directly deal
with Russia and her past. The Tuesday Edition
appreciates this informative article that Dr.
Hughes has submitted, and we feel sure that
it will be met by the approval of our readers.

By DR. THOMAS P. HUGHES

Associate Professor of History

To attempt a chronological survey of Russia
since the Revolution for the Washington and Lee
student would not be worthwhile. Each student

here has had the opportunity to read of this
period in authoritative texts used in our survey
courses. An hour of reading would serve as an
adequate refresher if R. R. Palmer's A History
of the Modern World were borrowed from one of
freshmen who has it as a required text.

In the raltively brief space available, I shall
comment upon a few for the opinions held by
our students about the history of Russia since
1917. I have heard these opinions expressed by
students whom I have had the privilege of
teaching in the few years I have been at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Quite frequently good students try to convince
me that the history of Russia since 1917 is a
unique phenomenon. They believe that the his-
tory of Russia since the Communists took pow-
er is unrelated to all that happened in Tsarist
Russia and without analogy to the recent history
of other nations. This opinion follows from the
assumption that the acceptance of the Commun-
ist ideology by the policy makers determines the
course of Soviet history.

freedom

This is the first in a series of ten articles by members of |
the Washington and Lee faculty dealing with Communism
and its various aspects.

Dr. Hughes’ article, Continuity and Change In Russia,
gives a clear picture that the history of Russia since the
Communists took over is not unrelated to events that hap-
pened in old Tsarist Russia.

This interpretation of history is as much a dis-
tortion as the belief that economics determine
history. Yet I have students tell me that the
reign of Peter the Great does not help them un-
derstand the reign of Khruschev or Stalin. Peter
was no communist but he tried to complete the
Volga-Don canal.

Rather than demonstrate that ideas—such
as communism—do not determine history, I
shall attempt to show that the reign of the
Comunists is but another epoch in the con-
tinuum of Russian history. As suggested above,
Lenin, Stalin, and Khruschev have continued a
long-standing Russian tradition in promoting
industrial development. During the Tsarist era
the government promoted industrial growth

primarily to strengthen the military. The wel-
fare of the great Russian population was sec-
ondary to supporting the role Russia aspired
to play as a great power. Since 1917 we have
witnessed a similar concentration of Russian
resources in heavy industry and military ap-
paratus.

Another example of the continuity of Russian
history is Russian foreign policy objectives since
1917. Students of history know that Russia has
long thrust eastward into Europe. The Nazi-Soviet
pact of 1939 brought the fourth partition of
Poland. Russia’s Balkan ambitions were consum-
mated—not originated—by Stalin. Honors papers
have been written at this University which trace
the uninterrupted penetration of Russian influ-
ence into central and far Asia.

Russia’s history has long been one of expan-
sion from the confines of the principality of Mus-
kovy out onto the great Eurasian plain. When
Khruschev and Stalin are judged at the bar of
history they, as the long line of Tsars, will justify
means of territories acquired. Expansion had be-
come a habit in Russia long before Lenin arrived

at the Finland Station. It would be an error,
therefore, to assume that the end of communism
in Russia would remove the Russian threat. Com-
munism is an enthusiasm-generating idea that
makes the Russians more effective in pursuing
traditional goals.

Some Washington and Lee students also wrong-
ly assume that arbitrary government and irregu-
lar succession to power in Russia is peculiar to
the Communist decades. Students of Russian his-
tory should know that Nicholas I had his third
section, and its functions and techniques were
similar to the secret police of Stalin. Political
police and arbitrary justice are common when
there is no rule of law and the Soviet system is
more in the Tsarist tradition than the Western
despite recent efforts in Russia to reform the
judicial establishment.

Irregular succession to power is also traditional
in Russia. Stalin and Khruschev won power by
techniques judged unconventional in the consti-
tution-minded Western nations, but the Era of
Palace Revolutions and the time of Troubles wit-
nessed maneuvering equally unorthodox.

Nor should it be forgotten that intricate
mechination which would have commanded the
respect of the Stalin of the ’20’s or the Khru-
schev of the ’50’s continually occurred around
the Russian throne. The power of the Tsar was
neither circumscribed nor regularized as stu-
dents of 19th century Russian political history
realize.

We have noted the carry-over of political,
economic, and foreign policy traditions into the
Communist era of Russian history and have im-
plied the maintenance of an authoritarian and
paternalistic ethos. The question now arises, what
have been the most dramatic changes occurring
within this traditional framework since 1917?
The answer is manifest in the headlines of our
daily papers—Russia has undergone an indus-
trial revolution.

If Russia had no transportation system knit-
ting together her far-flung resources and if she
had no communication system tying together her
decision-makers, her acceptance of the com-
munist ideology would be little more than a curi-
osity.

If Russia’s capacity to make steel and generate
power were not second only to ours, we would
view her with the contempt of the allied diplo-
mats of 1918 who knew that she could not sup-
port a modern army.

If Russia had not been able to take the lead
in making the most recent of the voyages of
discovery we could still argue that technology
could only flourish in a free-enterprise system.
As one of our great engineers recently observed,
missles are now made by gum-chewing young
ladies, Russian and American, who are often
oblivious to the economic system which feeds,
clothes, and entertains them.

A misconception among those who
are aware of the importance of rapid
industrialization in recent Russian his-
tory is the belief that this has been
the work of the Communists alone.

The industrial revolution began in
Russia under the Tsars during the late
19th century and the pattern of devol-
opment manifests continuity of growth.

Let’s Give College Athletic Conference py om

Washington and Lee, which seems to be in

has taken another cautious step forward in its
non-subsidized athletic program in the forma-
tion of the College Athletic Conference with
Centre, Sewanee, and Southwestern.

“Not much, why?”
and “I don’t know,
I have never ex-
perienced it.”

Such actions
would not be—I
assume—uncommon among the stu-
dents here or anywhere else, except-
ing a few eggheads and pseudo-intel-
lectuals. There’s a general theory that
academic freedom, whatever that real-
ly is, doesn’t exist here or at many
other colleges. The reason for this
theory is—and I’m no exception—we
students don’t care whether academic
freedom exists or not. We plunk down
our $20 per semester hour and take
what the professor doles out, provided
the upperclassmen who have had the
course say it’s not too hard and the
cold quiz file is adequate. And who's
to blame the poor professors? After
all, they have dedicated a life time to
knowledge and if they are faced year
after year by apathetic students I can
see how if it might get discouraging
for them.

ual assaulters, who probably would
have been better off unborn, after they
“force” a 16-year-old fraulein who
likes to play Eve. Such themes are
better unexposed, even to the morally
bankrupt. The one saving grace to

who says, “That’s what happens when

Lead Generals
Over Lynchburg

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Managing Editor

For the

frightening experience.

With 12 minutes to go in
the Generals’ battle

erals held a commanding 48-34
lead.
Bang. Lynchburg rocketed away

and tied the score, 50-50 at the 6:00
mark.

Three minutes later the Generals,” ”"

were again resting comfortably with a
62-52 margin.

Bang. Lynchburg again rocketed
away. This time it tied the score, 66-
66, as the regulation game ended. On
came a five-minute overtime.

After three minutes of overtime
play, the Generals were on top for
the third time at 74-70.

Bang. Lynchburg’s rocket supply
seemed to be endless. The Hornets
now knotted the score at 74-74.

W&L crept back ahead on Louis
Paterno’s jump shot with 1:10 left.

Lynchburg was silent. Their rock-
et fuel failed. The Generals won
their third game of the season, 78-
74, in a truly hectic 45 minutes of
wild and wooly basketball.

The key to the Generals’ win was
a sophomore transfer—Tom Supak—
who had shown terrific scoring ability
until Saturday.

Not only did Supak score 30 points
but he also hit an amazing 13 of 16
shots from the floor for a .812 per-
centage.

Supak collected all but two of the
game’s important goals.

His long jump shot with 5:00 left in
the first half started the Generals
drive to a 28-20 halftime lead.

He then broke 50-50 and 70-70 ties
with a pair of lay-ups.

Bill Ide, whose lay-up tied the
score at 70-70 halfway through the
overtime and Paterno’s winning
jump shot were the other two im-
portant goals of the contest.

Paterno scored 13 points and Ide got
nine. Ide paced the rebounding with
13. Supak and Howard Martin each
grabbed nine and Paterno gathered in
eight.

Supak, Paterno, and Ide were the
individual stars but the rest of the
team were the game’s unsung heroes.

The Generals journey to Hampden-
Sydney tonight and return home Sat-
urday against Randolph-Macon.

Mike Harris and Herb Jahncke high-
lighted the afternoon. Harris led the |

400 yard medley relay team of May-
nard, Warwick, and Monsarrat to vic-
tory with his record-breaking time of
1:01.2 in the 100-yard backstroke.

Jahnecke set a new record in the
200-yard individual medley relay with
a time of 2:13.5, shattering his own
pervious record of 2:17.1.

Maynard Wins

Also this year’s captain, Elliott May-
nard, won the 200 yard breast stroke

 

Jerry Kowalski Tops Scorers
In Frosh Win Over Fishburne

By BILL HILTON
Staff Reporter

Led by high-scoring Jerry Kowalski Washington and Lee’s
freshmen rolled over Fishburne Military Academy 65-41 last

Saturday afternoon.

Kowalski hit for 14 points and was high for the contest. Also in the scor-
ing columns for the Baby Generals were George Madison with 10, Don Liv-

ingston 10 and Dave Mosbough with 7*
markers.

Never in Trouble
W&L was never in trouble as they
jumped to an early lead and con-
tinued to build it even though Coach
Joe Lyles played all of his subs.

Showed Team Effort
The freshmen showed a fine team
effort and made Fishburne their fourth
victory against one loss for the sea-
son.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Let’s Support College Athletic Conference

(Continued from Page 2)
We heartly agree that W&L can defeat these
big-time opponents in some sports some of the
time; but the Generals cannot beat all these
big-timers in all the sports all of the time.

In fact, it is foolish to even suspect that
W&L could consistently or even occasional-
ly beat schools such as North Carolina, Wil-
lian & Mary, Virginia, Richmond, Wake For-
est, North Carolina State, and Duke in foot-
ball or basketball, the two backbones of any
athletic program.

It has taken seven long, hard years to build
up Washington & Lee’s successful non-subsi-
dized athletic program. Since the school is
winning on its present level, it realized that it
was time to strengthen its program. It did
so by the best way it knew how—the forma-
tion of an “amateur” conference with three
other non-subsidized schools. Being in a con-
ference creates a new spirit of competition,
gives the schools a goal to strive for in each
sport, and brings it wider recognition and
praise when it wins a conference title no mat-
ter how small the conference. After seven
years as an independent W&L deserves a
chance at a conference title again. The Col-
lege Athletic Conference gives it that chance.

The new conference admittedly has its
drawbacks: (1) It is too small with only four
members. (2) The members are too wide
spread. But it must be remembered that it is
hard to induce a large number of schools to
give up their independent status and join a
brand new conference before the conference

With the formation of the College Athletic
Conference Washington & Lee has, as the
Roanoke Times said editorially Sunday, “once
again demonstrated its determination to con-
tinue its sensible athletic policy, which in
sports jargon is ‘Simon Pure,” defined by the
dictionary as ‘genuine; authentic.’ ”

The College Athletic Conference with its
emphasis on “amateur athletics’? could be-
come a milestone in the returning of athletics
to a place of honor in institutions of higher
learning. Let’s give the conference a chance
to prove itself and not condemn it before it

gets started. —J.M.A.

Another Grid Honor

Washington’s Touchdown Club recently
named Washington and Lee as the nation’s
number one small college football team for
the 1961 season. We would like to second this
nomination and offer a few statistics from the
NCAA’s final report to back up this accolade.

Out of nine team categories W&L ranked
in the top ten in four of these groups—a
mark bettered by only one other school, Flor-
ida A&M. The Generals were ninth in scor-
ing with a 33.0 average; third in rushing de-
fense with a 52.6 mark; fourth in total defense
with a 115.9 average; and ninth in defense
against scoring with a 5.1 mark.

To Coach Lee McLaughlin and his unde-
feated five-star Generals we say:

Thanks for the priviledge of being able to
watch such a fine football team as you in ac-

 

has proven itself.

Editor Roger Paine said that there
is “a remote possibility” that the
Fancy Dress issue of The Southera

that should be the case, which de-
pends largely on exams, the starl-
wart make-up artists in the print
shop, and a bottle of Early Times,
then F.D. goers can look forward
to new heights of repulsion,” ac-
cording to Paine.

A parody on the “Magazine Wo-
men Believe In,” The Ladies’ Home
Journal, will be featured. The usual
low-class trash will, of course, be
included,” he said.

“The magazine will be worth
ing if only for the one non-repulsive
thing in the issue—the girls from
Sweet Briar. The winners of the
“Huffman Cup” will also be an-
nounced,” said Paine, adding, “Col-
legian staff members wish everybody
a Merry Christmas.”

Nagy Criticizes Policies
Of U. S. Toward Russia

Praising the U.S. for its occupation policies and criticizing
its stand in regard to Russian aggression, Ferenc Nagy, for-
mer Prime Minister of Hungary, spoke Tuesday night in

duPont Auditorium on the
Europe.”
Activities in the Hungarian*

Parliamen in 1939 and his participa-
tion in the underground during
World War II resulted in Nagy’s
being imprisoned by the Nazis in
1944. In 1945 he took control of the
Democratic Coalition Government in
Hungary.

In 1947 he was forced into exile
by the Communists, and he now
makes his home in Herndon, Va.

“At this time when the world is
full of problems in Berlin, the Congo,
and Viet Nam,” began Mr. Nagy,
“a discussion of Hungary may not
seem timely.”

“However,” he explained, “these
problems all started when the Soviet
Union used its occupation right to
take control of Hungary.

Focus on Eastern Europe

He added that, as a result of the
Soviet conquest of Eastern Europe,
the world is now split into two
large camps on which rest the bur-
den of the armament race.

“Before the problems of world

 

‘Situation in Central-Eastern

 

diplomats are over,” he said, “the
West must once again focus its at-
tention on Eastern Europe.

Criticizing the arms race, Nagy
said, “We can’t replace a_ well-
planned policy with an armament
race. We are ready to go to our
cellars and increase our arms, but
we are not willing to solve the
problems in Western and Central
Europe.”

He emphasized the difference be-
tween American and Russian occu-
pation policies. The United States,
he said, has replaced dictatorship
with democracy, naming Italy and
West Germany as examples of this
fact. On the other hand, where
there had been democracies, the
Soviets have created dictatorships.

ern and Central Europe is caused

PROBES Editor
Finds Sales Good;
Story Commended

The winter edition of Probes went
on sale yesterday and according to
editor Ronald Alenstein, “People
are taking to it well.”

He had these further comments to
make concerning the publication:
“I’ve had many compliments on it.
I'd like to thank all the contribu-
tors. I am happy with their stories
and poems. I'd also like to thank Jay
Green for his illustrations. I’ve re-
ceived several compliments on them
also.”

Probes is the student literary pub-
lication founded last year by Tony
Gray. Only one edition came out
last year, but because of its success,
two issues will be published this
year. According to Alenstein, the
second edition will appear after
Spring Dances.

A copy of Probes may be purch-
ased at McCrum’s, Doc’s, The Co-op
or the College Inn for fifty cents.

Probes was founded last year “to
provide an outlet for student cre-
ativity.” All articles and_ illustra-
tions are by students and any stu-
dent may submit writing or original
drawings for possible publication.

The winter edition contains five
poems and four short stories by
six different writers and several il-
lustrations by Tony Gray.

The five poems are “Lunacy,”
“The Frown of God,” and “Novem-
ber Water Colour,” written by C.
P. White, Jr.; “Husband’s Lament,”
written by editor Ron Alenstein; and
“In the Museum” by W. H. Chaplin.

The four short stories are “Joy,”
by Mike Shepperd; “The Air Show,”
by Steve Henry, “Tiger Zanton and
Mr. Mac,” by Steve Cook; and “A
Small Destruction,” by the editor.

 

Computer Classes To Begin

On Monday, a course for faculty
and administration in the use of
W&L’s new IBM 1620 computer
will begin in the Computer Class

gramming problems will be assigned;
about 40 professors have been signed
to date.

Open to any faculty or administra-
tion member, the course will pre-
pare those who take it in using the
computer in their own work.

Nine Seniors Seeking Honors

By PHIL OLIVER

Nine Washington and Lee seniors
are doing honors work this year.
The seniors, all of whom have been
on the Dean’s List for the last two
years, are Rick Anderson, Dick
Jones, Jim McClung, Bill McKim,
Hugh Paton, Jack Vardaman, Bond
Johnson, Ernest Ladd, and Allen
Stubbs.

Each of the students must take
both oral and written exams on their
whole field of study, made up by the
professors in the student’s depart-
ment,

A thesis of 50 to 100 pages in
length is also required. The amount
of research that goes into a thesis is
important because graduate schools
look closely at the quality and
quantity of the research.

Jim McClung, an English major,
summed up one reason why seniors
undergo the extensive study, re-
search, and writing needed to com-
plete the honors work. He said that
“honors work enhances your chance
of getting into graduate school and
receiving a fellowship.”

McClung’s thesis will be entitled
“The Study of the Moral Order in
the Novels of George Eliot.” He will
read biographies of Eliot, a volume
of letters, and all of her novels.

Rick Anderson, another English

 

major, is writing a thesis which |
he will entitle “Geoffrey Chaucer |
and the Influence of Early French
Writers on the Cantebury Tales.” |
Anderson became interested in|
Chaucer in one of his English Class- |
es. Since he likes French, he said,
“I thought I would try to work
them together.”

Hugh Paton, an American history |
major, will entitle his thesis “Pub- |
lic Opinion in Massachusetts During
the Slavery Controversy.” Paton said
his thesis will be centered around
the Compromise of 1850. Thus far
his research has been mainly in
newspapers dating around 1850. He
said he found this interesting be-
cause of the other articles he found
in the newspapers. “They had many |
of the same problems that we have
today,” he said.

Allen Stubbs, a psychology major,
is doing research on secondary and
primary reinforcement. With the
new department equipment, he will
be doing experiments with rats. The
end result he wishes to achieve
through his research is a correlation
between behavior of rats and the
behavior of humans.

Jack Vardaman, a European his-
tory major, will entitle his thesis
“Arnold Toynbee and Western Civi- |
lization.” Vardaman stated that
Toynbee’s work “A Study of History

 

| will fit the pattern of breakdown to

| en down. In conclusion he will sug-

| 19th century and not the modern-

sets up patterns for history. One of
these patterns shows how civiliza-
tions can break down. Although
Mr. Toynbee does not put Western
civilization to any of his patterns, he
hints in certain sections of “A Study
of History” that Western Civiliza-
tion is breaking down. Vardaman

Western civilization and try to de-
termine whether or not our civiliza-
tion is breaking down or has brok-

gest steps to avert breakdown if it
exists.

Bond Johnson, another European
history major will write on “Arnold
Toynbee: A Study in Social Con-
science.” This Arnold Toynbee is
a contemporary of the Industrial
Revolution in England during the

day historian. The Victorian Toyn-
bee believed that by studying eco- |
nomic history, he could finds the an-
swer to slums and poverty. John-
son’s thesis will be a literary type
of history, a biography, and will in-
clude criticism of Toynbee’s works. |
Johnson has done a great deal of |
letter writing and research for a}
complete picture of a subject about |
which very little is known.

English major Bill MeKim_ will |
entitle his thesis, “John Donne: His |
Recognition of Multiple Perspectives |

 

and His Feelings That There Must
Be One that Transcends All.” In his
thesis McKim will explain how
Donne felt great tension over com-
mitment to one world order. This
one world order according to Donne
was one God for all men. Yet he
was aware that the world can be
ordered by many. A history of the
conflict against tolerance will be
worked into the thesis.

Ernest Ladd of the Commerce
School will entitle his thesis, “The
Effective Federal Reserve Policy in
the recession of 1960-61.” Ladd will
establish a cause and effect relation-
ship between the action of the Fed-
eral Reserve Board and what hap-
pened to the economy. “The reces-

decrease in buying after the mer-
chants had a great inventory build-
up. The Political campaigns caused
a deepening of the recession be-

colleges, of which 22 are privately
endowed, to receive the amount. The
grant was awarded, as in past years,
on the strength of the university s
chemistry department.

The duPont company, of Wilming-
ton, Del., awarded a total of $690,-
000 to 161 colleges and universities.
The program is_ designed for
“strengthening the teaching of sci-
ence and related subjects, for funda-
mental research by universities, and
for facilities for education or re-
search in science and engineering.”

The purpose of the $4,000 given
W&L is to “help them maintain the
excellence of their teaching.”

H-S Tigers
Monday Night

Washington and Lee’s Debating
Team set down Hampden-Sydney
in a dual meet Monday night as
one General team went undefeated
and the other lost one and tied one
match. The score of 2-1-1 is not in-
dicative of the point spread which
W&L held over their opponents.

Coach William Chaffin took his
team of Ed Norton, Barry Staniar,
Malcolm Morris, and Steve Smith
to Hampden-Sydney for the meet.
Though all are relatively inexper-
ienced, the squad made a fine show-
ing.

Norton and Staniar, who had
never participated in intercollegiate
debate prior to the meet, took a
surprise plan designed to baffle the
opposition; Morris and Smith, fresh-
men, took a new case with them
also.

The “curve ball” plan failed by
a scant margin when Staniar and
Norton were held to a split decision
tie by the Judges in their affirmative
debate; the two who had never de-
bated the negative side before, lost
their negative match.

Morris and Smith outtalked the
Hampden-Sydney debaters by scores
of 37-30 and 31-18. Smith was high
point man for the debates.

Washington and Lee swept top
honors in both categories to defeat
VMI in the second annual W&L-
VMI Speech Night, Tuesday. Elected
representatives of the speech de-
partments of both schools met in the
contests.

Bill Noel took first place in the
original oratory contest and Sandy
Walton won the impromptu speech
category. John Lackey was a close
second to Noell.

Noell, Walton, and Lackey had
been elected by members of the
speech classes to orate in the meet
against the best of VMI. Noell’s sub-
ject was “Beliefs,” Walton’s “Aid

The decision to hold two concerts
was made because of the unusual
theme and has already been approv-
ed by the Faculty Social Functions
Committee.

Both the Dance Board and the
Dance Board Advisory Committee
have already appointed committees
and begun working to make this
year’s Springs “the best ever.”

Several changes and modifications
for Fancy Dress were also announc-
ed after final arrangements had been
made for the use of the Commons.

Costumes Required

The first of these announcements
was concerning dress. All students
must come in full dress, meaning
that they must have costumes. All
girls must wear formals—short or
floor length—but cocktail dresses are
not permissable.

Costume sales ended this after-
noon at 5:00. Although the final
figures on the sales will not be re-
leased until next week, according
to Galef, this year’s sales are “al-
most doubled last year’s.”

A change in Dance Board policy
concerning students coming to
Fancy Dress from other colleges
will permit students wishing to bring
guests to purchase tickets for them
at reduced rates. These will be in
effect until Friday, January 26, and
a student purchasing tickets must
give his guest’s name and _ school
and pay for the tickets at the same
time.

The reduced rates will be $5 for
the concert or $10 for the concert
and both dances. Admission at the
door will be $7.50 for the concert
and $5 for each of the dances. By
purchasing his tickets before Jan-
uary 26, a student may save his
guest $7.50.

Final arrangements for using the
Commons were made yesterday af-
ternoon at a meeting between mem-
bers of the administration and the
faculty and the Fancy Dress Co-
ordination Committee. On the night
of the Fancy Dress Ball, there will
be no parking allowed on either
side of the street in front of the
Commons. The Dance Board urges
all students to co-operate in this
ruling, since having the dance in
the Dining Hall is only on a trial
basis.

Another innovation this year is
that the doors of the Commons will
be locked during the figure, which
will begin at 9:00. All students wish-
ing to see it must be at the dance
before the figure starts.

Fountain Featured

This year’s theme being “High
Society,” the Commons will be dec-
orated as a ball room such as
would be used for an Inaugural
Ball. The decorations will feature
a fountain with circulating water,
large potted plants and other ap-
propriate decorations.

Although there will be no refresh-
ments available in the Commons, the
Co-op will be opened during the
hours of the dance and refreshments
may be purchased there.

Saturday's concert, featuring jazz
personality Dave Brubeck and his
Orchestra will be from 3-5 p.m. The
event will be held in Doremus Gym.
Dress will be conventional.

The Saturday dance with Si Zenter
and his orchestra will be from 8
to 11 p.m. The dress will be semi-
formal. Permission to change the
|dress from formal to semi-formal
| was granted by the Faculty Social
| Functions Committee in December.
| The Saturday dance will be held in
Doremus Gym, and decorations will
be similar to those Friday night. An
| innovation of the Saturday dance
will be tables arranged around the
| dance floor.

A Word Of Appreciation

We would like to say a few words of our own in respect
to the recent announcement of Mr. Gilliam’s retirement as
Dean of Students.

Dean Gilliam has inevitably impressed a good deal of his
personal style on the University. We especially hope that the
individual interest he took in every student in the University
will be continued by Dr. Atwood.

Serving as both Dean of Admissions and Dean of Students,
Mr. Gilliam has been in a particularly good position to follow
from the very beginning the career of every student in the
University. He has taken a personal interest in every one of us,
a policy that few other men would attempt, much less carry
off sucessfully. And there are few students at Washington and
Lee who cannot think immediately of several instances when
Dean Gilliam’s interest in, and knowledge of, their own prob-
lems helped them over rough spots in their college careers.

One of the brightest aspects of the Washington and Lee
scene is the warm, friendly atmosphere which prevails on
campus, and the lack of barriers between students and profes-
sors and members of the administration. No single person
connected with Washington and Lee has done more to foster
this attitude than Dean Gilliam. His personal unselfishness has
rendered service to the University in more ways than we feel
fit to appraise. We are delighted that he is staying on as Dean
of Admissions, and we look with confidence to the prospect of
his continued service in that vital post.

Debaters hes Peed Again

Almost unnoticed in the big news of the past week at the
University was the announcement that Washington and Lee
has been invited to join the forensic division of the Atlantic
Coast Conference as an associate member. The invitation is
quite an honor for W&L and a fine testimony to the extraor-
dinary job that Mr. William W. Chaffin has done as coach of
the debate team and as an instructor in public speaking.

Just as any educated man should be able to express himself
clearly and vigorously on his feet, any university worthy of the
name should encourage and honor this quality.

The Ghost Walks

The Interfraternity Conference proposals for the regula-
tion of Hell Week roused the annual ghost again. Once again
debate has broken out on the purpose and methods of Hell
Week.

There is probably no single facet of University life open
to more difference of opinion than this one. Opinions vary
from those old-timers who would like to see paddling of fresh-
men reinstated to those who would like to see all forms of fra-
ternity domination of pledges removed.

 

While the debates have been going on, the relative
difficulty and unpleasantness of Hell Week, and of all pledge
training activities has been decreasing each year.

A number of factors have caused these slight changes,
especially the increasing difficulty of the freshman year aca-
demically, and the growing tendency for students to identify
more closely with the University as a whole than with the fra-
ternities. We can find no fault either with the changing nature
of pledge training or with the attitudes that are causing the
changes.

What the IFC proposals of Monday night amounted to
was an affirmation that they intended to enforce the existing
rules. It certainly should be the ‘“‘duty and prerogative” of the
IFC president, as Bob Doenges termed it, to see that the rules
are enforced.

We have always held that Hell Week tends to draw the
members of the fraternity, and especially each year’s pledge
class, closer together. But it seems to us that Hell Week has
become more and more a meaningless ritual which degrades
both pledges and upperclassmen. The means have been denied
the fraternities to make it really tough—an ordeal that their
freshmen will be proud to have undergone successfully. Each
year there is a good deal of disagreement within each house
over what to do during Hell Week. The resulting arguments
are often bitter, and are almost always carried off by the mi-
nority of “tough” guys, who turn out to be the only men in
the house who care to take the time to work on the freshmen.
The people who want a “Constructive” Hell Week, or Help
Week, in this case, always throw up their hands in disgust and
refuse to have anything further to do with the matter.

Now we hear that the fraternities, in typical fashion, are
rejecting the rather mild IFC proposals for this year. Many
argue that the proposals really do not say anything new.
Though a step in the right direction, they are certainly a dis-
appointment to those people who want to see a more lenient and
constructive Help Week.

It seems to us that the time has come to try a radical solu-
tion to the problem. It’s probably too late for the IFC to come
up with a solution that will receive any support whatsoever
from the fraternities. This year it seems the best the IFC can
do is try to enforce what rules they have now. The fraternities
would do well to try and do what they can within that frame-
work, rather than trying to avoid even these mild sanctions.

Wouldn’t it be a sight, though, if some house had enough
good sense to drop the thing entirely? We wouldn’t miss it.

 

W&L Defeated
In Roanoke
By Missile Gap

By STEVE ALLHENRY

(The following is a sports story
which will undoubtedly appear in
the Ring-tum Phi some time in the
future. We'll call it “A Ring-tum
Phi Sportswriter at the Chess
match.”)

If you’re the kind of person who
likes a heart-stopping, fast-moving,
utterly exhilerating game of chess,
you should have seen last night’s
match between W&L and the Roa-
noke Chess Club.

The taller, more experienced, fast-
breaking, hard-moving Roanokers
finally won out, 5-4, but not until
they had mastered W&L’s fired-up,
inspired and generally exciting Gen-
erals.

W&L jumped into an early lead
when Arnold (Killer) Anderson
flashed exciting strategy to check-
mate Roanoke’s Paul (Horrible)
Johnson in one hour and _ forty
minutes.

But then Roanoke turned on the
old rocket fuel.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Roanoke’s
red-shirt ace Ivan Ilynnn, playing
his usual slashing offensive game,
stopped W&L’s Ike (Old Panther)
Osgood in a stirring two and a half
hour match.

But the Generals rocketed back
on the strength of an awesome dis-
play of defensive prowess by junior
Jerry Pace. He defeated Roanoke’s
Ole Jones to put W&L in a surpris-
ing, unbelievable, wonderful 2-1
lead.

But then, without a trace of warn-
ing, Roanoke went into orbit.

Woosh, zowey, boom, bang, whee,
zot! Roanoke got back-to-back wins
from high scoring lettermen Olaf
Petranovitch and Joe Jones to take
a 3-2 lead.

The best was yet to come, how-
ever.

Crash, bam, yippee. The second
booster on the Roanoke rocket took
over, and two more die-hard, hard-
nosed, outrebrounded and outgun-
ned Generals went down to defeat.

Roanoke’s famed brother combina-
tion, Nicolai and Nicolay Ostravitch,
showed their All-American potential
to W&L’s Billy (Killer II) Martin,
and Bob (Nike I) Black.

The Ostravitch boys put a harras-
sing Queen’s Indian defense up
against Martin and Black, forcing
the W&L duo into repeated mistakes
in their own part of the board.

It was utterly horrible, tragic, and
worst of all depressing when the
stunned crowd of 37,000 packed into
Doremus Gymnasium realized that
Roanoke had put the match out of
reach for the Generals.

Outstanding for the Generals were
Anderson and Pace, mainly because
they both won. However, we are
not saying that their performance
was all good. But it wasn’t all bad,
either.

Besides, winning isn’t important
at W&L, because we are clean, pure,
unravished, refreshing, forward-
stepping, and ingenious.

Woosh!

An Interview With Dr. Phillips

 

A Problem For Conservatives:
Criticizing The Radical Right

By TRACY HARRINGTON

American politics, for most of us,
is a complex and many-sided con-
troversy. The problems of the coun-
try are abundant—economic, diplo-
matic, military and social. And there
are uncontrollable groups that stand
on every possible side of every pos-
sible fence. Most of these groups
will stand primarily on the conser-
vative side or the liberal side, with
occasional rail-hopping on a particu-
lar issue.

One group, however, stands alto-
gether on one side of one fence.
Small in numbers, they make them-
selves heard—and very loudly.

That group is the John Birch
Society. They are the blatant broth-

ers of the frightened right right. To}

them, the sole problem of our society

seems to be the “threat of commun-| :

ism.”

Dr. Phillips, of the economics de-|'-

partment, gave the JBS little power
generally. He did say that the group
was “as much a thorn in the side

of policy and offers no solution ex-
cept name-calling.”

“There are a lot of people con-
cerned about Communism, but they
are concerned about other things
too. Personally, I don’t think the
internal threat of Communism as
bad as they make it out to be.

“Life is too short to become ob-
sessed with a single idea like that.”

Does Dr. Phillips think the John
Birchers have any growing influ-
ence?

Few Would Support JBS

“Few if any college students would
support them,” he said. “The John
Birch Society has become a laugh-

of the Republican Party as the ADA | &

is in the side of the Democratic
Party.”

Famous for Name-Calling

The John Birch Society in an
amazingly short time has gained na-
tional notice. It has accomplished
this chiefly with its now fabled
label of “Communist” to such prom-
inent persons as General Eisenhower,
Milton Eisenhower, Eleanor Roose-
velt and Allen Dulles.”

“This is ridiculous,”
said.

He said he saw no purpose served
“by ealling everybody a Commun-
ist.” He pointed out that the JBS
is “obsessed with one major aspect

ing matter with many people. The
president of the group has said that
the membership goal first set of one

 

million seems to him ‘unrealistic’
now.”

Returning to the subject of Gold-
water and the society, Dr Phillips—
who is himself a Republican—said
the JBS “tends to have basically
Goldwater-type conservatism. They
have not come out and said they
supported him for President, but
they probably would support him.
However, they have disagreed with
him on several issues.”

How does Goldwater feel about
JBS?

Dr. Phillips said, “Goldwater has
neither denounced nor supported the
society. All he has said is that
‘there are some good men in it.” 1
don’t think he could support them,
because he is too intelligent a
man.”

Goldwater and the Radicals

As a presidential possibility, Dr.
Phillips doesn’t believe Goldwater
could be elected if he openly sup-
ported the JBS. “He would have no
chance to run for president if he
did.”

About the JBS, ADA, and other
splinter groups in general, Dr. Phil-
lips said, “Very few people could
say they were either Democrats
or Republicans 100% of the time.
You are going to find disagreements
with either party sometime. If you
are satisfied with 50% of a party’s
policies, that is a pretty good aver-
age.”

“Within both parties you will find
factions that don’t ever agree with
the other party and who agree with
the other party less than 50% of the
time. This is where the extremists—
men usually obsessed with one major
issue—come from.”

 

An Analysis Of The Speaking Tradition

By HOWARD SLATER

“To speak or not to speak—Is that

a question?”
(unidentified irate alumnus, circa
class of ’39)

There are many good points which
can be made both for and against
the speaking tradition. This is in-
deed a serious problem since our
social appearances are here at stake.
In general, I am in favor of saying
hello, although with some reserva-
tions. Here are my reasons why:

1. The speaking tradition is a good
thing because it improves a man’s
posture. He must keep his head up
in order to say hello. He cannot
lapse into the tempting habit of
holding the head sideways in imi-
tation of Alexander the Great, and
he cannot keep his head pointed in
the direction of the ground, looking,
no doubt, for cracks in the bases of
our columns. This last does not ap-
ply, however, when one encounters
a less-than-tall member of the stu-
dent body, such as myself, who has

 

to be looked down on.

 

2. The speaking tradition is a good
thing because it strengthens the eye
muscles. Greeting another person
requires one to keep one’s eyes
fixed on one spot—the eyes of the
person he is greeting—despite the
jolting up and down, incident to
one’s natural walking gait. This, of
course, does not apply when one
encounters a fellow student with
Mongoloid features, such as myself,
whose eyes are difficult to distin-
guish from the other facial features.

3. The speaking tradition is also
a good thing because it promotes
perserverance. The theory behind
this, to which I fully subscribe, is
that if one can say hello to those
one cordially dislikes, then one can
endure almost every kind of un-
pleasantry.

4. And finally, but only as a minor
point, the speaking tradition is a
good thing because it promotes an
atmosphere of friendliness and good
will.

Some Reservations

There are, however, a few reserva-

 

From A Fulbright Scholar In France . . .

 

U.S. And French Schools Differ

(Al Broaddus, who graduated from
Washington and Lee last year, is
studying European history and po-
litical science at the University of
Strasbourg in France this year, un-
der a Fulbright scholarship. He
agreed to write articles on the
French scene for the Ring-tum Phi
from time to time during the year.)

By AL BROADDUS

Strasbourg, Jan 6—The university
system in France is, to most Amer-
ican students studying here, a sys-
tem quite different from the one to
which they are accustomed. It is
of course, less than fully accurate
to speak of a “uniform” university
system in the United States, al-
though the word may be validly
applied to what exists in France.
A comparison of student life at
W&L, Ohio State, Columbia, and
West Point should be enough to
make this clear. Nonetheless, Amer-
ican universities hold certain general
traits in common, and it is in this
light that differences between our
own and French student life may
be presented.

There are nineteen universities in
France, including the giant in Paris
(enrollment 100,000), and eighteen in
the provinces. The latter are located
in such major cities as Lyon, Bor-
deaux, and Strasbourg. Each univer-
sity takes the name of the city in
which it is located. They are all state
institutions. An entirely different
view exists in France regarding the
nature and function of a university
from the one prevailing in the

United States. In France, the uni-
versity itself exists, almost solely,
to provide courses and degrees. And
little else. In order to obtain a
degree the student must, at the
end of the year, pass a set of «xami-
nations. This is (in cases of most
degrees) all that is demanded of
the student for the degree.

Academic Progress Ignored

In most cases the university and
faculty are not concerned with the
student’s academic progress during
the semester. (Foreign students
notice the extremely mechanical at-
mosphere in many French classes,
particularly in basic courses. Pro-
fessor enters classroom,
stand up, sit down, professor begins,
students lower heads in note-taking,
class finishes, students rise, profes-
sor and students leave. Questions are
rare.) Thus, in most sections of the
university, there are no_ periodic
quizzes during the semester, com-
pulsory class attendance, etc., al-
though a student may be required
in certain courses to deliver a short
lecture or two. The rigid exami-
nations at the close of the academic
year are considered an adequate
indicator of the student’s ability in
his chosen field.

Thus, from the point of view of
the university itself, there is no
campus or campus life in France, as
we understand these terms in the
United States. There are no housing
or eating facilities offered by the
university. There is limited dormi-

 

tory space available in “cities uni-

students |

 

versitaires,” but these are small, and
usually reserved for the students do-
ing advanced work. Most students
find rooms in private apartments, or
in hotels which cater to them.

French Students Are Unionized

Although there is no campus in
France in the American sense, this
is not to say that there is no student
life. On the contrary, although the
French student is relatively isolated
and independent in contrast to his
American counterpart, there is a
very definite student movement
here. In fact it may be said that stu-
dents in France make up a very dis-
tinct social class, and they are re-
garded as such by others. French
students are unionized, and _ their
national organization is recognized
by the state, which deals with it in
the same fashion it deals with labor
unions. It is through this organiza-
tion that French students have man-
aged to establish several university
resturants in each university city,
serving meals at the equivalent of
22 cents each.

Furthermore, the greater number
of French students, it appears to
me, fall into a fairly uniform po-
litical position—the mean falling
probably rather close to the posi-
tion of the French Socialist Party.
French students are a very definite
political body to be reckoned with.
Much of their political activity is
organized and effectuated through
the medium of the national union.
At present the greater part of this

(Continued on page 4)

 

tions to this favorable conclusion.
In the first place, there are certain
technical difficulties involved in the
mechanics of the speaking tradition.
An extreme instance of this occurs
along the colonnade during the rush
between classes, when it is simply
impossible to greet everyone. There-
fore, the speaking tradition ought to
be supended at those times. Or, as
an alternative, regulations could be
established whereby students walk-
ing in the direction of duPont Hall
will be required to wend their way
thither backwards.

Another alternative would be to
have some of our brethern give in-
structions on how to pass people
with a remote and fishy smile, an
averted eye, and the unspoken hint
that this perhaps is to be construed
as a greeting. Others, who are op-
posed to construing in general, or
who prefer a more manly approach,
can simply ignore this type of greet-
ing which is so much the rage pres-
ently.

Another Doremus?

A second reservation about the
speaking tradition is that it got us
a gymnasium, the demerits of which
are obvious. Perhaps this can be
remedied by a quickie course in
“How to Tell What an Alumnus or
Visitor Will Donate IF One Says
Hello to Him.”

However, there is a third and
most important reason of all for not
wholeheartedly supporting the con-
cept of speaking tradition. This is
that the Assimilation Committee
supports it! It is quite clear to us
us all that Assimilation Committee
members are, in reality, frustrated
throwbacks to the Spanish Inquisi-
tion. An exact description of them
indeed, which makes the speaking

Generals Face —_ Randolph- -Macon Saturday

 

Editorial Cites Advantages
Of New Athletic Conference

(The following editorial, entitled ‘‘A Refreshing Breeze,”
appeared in the Lynchburg Daily Advance on the same day
that the news of the new College Athletic Conference was
announced. )

Today’s announcement of a new—and very different—
kind of organization for intercollegiate sports comes at a time-
ly moment. We’re just getting over a rash of bowl games which
point up, more than any other sports spectacle of the year, all
the evils of commercialization, cheap publicity, big-time gamb-

Fauber, Ide, Paterno
To Lead W&L Attack

After a disappointing loss to Hampden-Sydney, Washing-
ton and Lee’s basketball Generals move back into Doremus
Gymnasium tomorrow night for a game against powerful
Randolph-Macon.

The Yellow Jackets could be the best team to play in Dore-
mus this year, and Coach Bob McHenry’s Generals will have
their hands full holding down a talented group of high scor-

ing R-M veterans.
Veterans has real meaning when*

 

ling, and overemphasis on athletics to which far too many of
our American institutions of higher learning must plead guilty.

Swimmers Ready
For Georgetown

The Washington and Lee Varsity
swimming team will risk its unde-
feated season tomorrow afternoon
when they play host to Georgetown
University. The meet is scheduled
for 2:30 at the Doremus gymnasium
pool.

Coach Norris Eastman hinted af-
ter time trials on Thursday that pos-
sibly five pool records might be set
in the upcoming meet. Freshman
John Wolfe in both the 220 and 440
yard freestyle, backstroker Mike
Harris, Herb Jahncke in the 200
yard individual medley, and the 400
yard medley relay team have all
come close to existing records this
year.

Last year the tankmen swamped
Georgetown 61-34 but Eastman
warned, “We know nothing about
them and a team can improve a lot
in one year.”

He also pointed out that the
toughest part of the season lies
ahead. The mermen must face swim-
ming powerhouses Maryland and the
University of Pittsburgh and a
strong East Carolina team during the
second half of the season.

 

Referee Calls Paterno
‘Best Frosh’ In Years
To Play For Generals

“He’s the most exciting basketall
player at W&L since Flora.”

That’s how one official who work-
ed the Hampden-Sydney-W&L
basketball game last Tuesday night,
described the Generals’ freshman
guard, Louie Paterno.

Paterno got 17 points against the
tough Tigers in what coach Bob Mc-
Henry called “his best performance
of the year.”

In Paterno and sophomore Tom
Supac, the Generals have one of
the most potent backcourt scoring
combinations in the state.

Supac and Paterno have person-
ally contributed 79 points during the
last two W&L games. Supac hit for
30 against Lynchburg, while Paterno
picked up 13. In the Hampden-
Sydney game, Supac led the Gener-
als with 19.

Paterno, W&L’s first freshman
starter since Bip Fauber arrived in
1959, has been steadily improving all
year. He broke into the starting
line-up with a good performance
against Catholic University.

For some years the leadership of
a tiny minority of our colleges has
seen these evils for what they are,
and has taken forceful action to
eliminate them. One conspicuous ex-
ample is Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, which eight years ago buck-
ed the wrath of a great portion of
its alumni—and students as well—
to withdraw from big-time footbail
and put the game as well as other
sports into proper perspective.

The wisdom of this decision was
slow to be recognized. But in recent
months it has been catching on
and spreading to many other US.
campuses where emphasis has tra-
ditionally resided in academic
achievement and not on conquests
on the athletic field.

Four such schools, binding them-
selves together under a general phil-

osophy of education first, last, and | —

always, are today announcing the
formation of a precedent-shattering
athletic conference to see that this
philosophy is translated into action.

The founding members of what
will be called the College Athletic
Conference and which will become
operational in 1962-63 are W&L,
Centre College, Southwestern of
Memphis, and the University of the
South.

The conference’s Articles of Or-
ganization pinpoint in unequivocal
language the novel ideals and pur-
poses of the league. One cardinal
principle is that “all participation in
sports by members of its teams shall
be solely because of interest in and
the enjoyment of the game...No
financial aid shall be given to any
student which is conditioned upon,
or for the purpose of encouraging,
his participation in intercollegiate
sports. All financial aids of the
member institutions shall be admin-
istered by a single agency of the
faculty. No aid funds shall be spe-
cifiically reserved for athletes, and
the directors of athletics and coaches
shall have no voice or participation
in the determination of recipients or
amounts of financial aid to any stu-
dent. Criteria for admission to the
individual member institutions will
be the same for all students.

Well, that’s as strong an answer
to the promoters, gamblers and to

The other returnee from Uncle
Sam’s leagues is 6’2” Frank Roberts,
who plays equally well at either
forward or guard.

Joining Roberts and Kaminski in
the Jacket starting line-up will be
Billy Allen and Chuck Chambers
at guards, and Tommy Tucker at the
forward opposite Roberts.

activity takes the form of agitation
against the extreme rightist Secret
Army Organization (OAS). A na-
tionwide demonstration against the
OAS was undertaken December 19,
by students in conjunction with the
General Confederation of Workers
and the French Confederation of
Christian Workers, French labor
unions.

One is able to see, therefore, that
while there is no campus in the
American sense in France, so that
the university as a university is not
as distinct, complete, and loyalty-
commanding an influence upon the
student as in the United States,
there exists, nonetheless, a very defi-
nite French student class, more co-
hesive, and more apparent as a dis-
tinct feature of the society than is
the case in the United States.

Behind The News

Dr Charles Phillips, who is inter-
viewed on the editorial page today,
was quoted in the Thursday Wall
Street Journal: “The only solution
to the current labor problem is to
reduce the size of the bargaining
units. Industry wide bargaining is
a hindrance to competitive enterp-
rize, because there is always the
danger of an industry-wide strike.
We must solve this problem first.”

The quote origizally appeared in
an article in the Ring-tum Phi.

In an interview in the Ring-tum
Phi today, Dr. Phillips denounces
the anti-communist radical right.
Dr. Phillip’s quote in the Journal
ironically appeared beneath a quote
by a prominent Communist.

Conformism In France

There is another factor which en-
ters here. This is that, as I suggested
earlier, student life in France, on a
national basis, is highly uniform in
comparison with the United States.
This means that, while there exist
academic differences among the nine-
teen French universities, the life of
the student of any one of them is
likely to be quite similar to that of
his colleagues studying at any of
the others. As a result, the American
student has the advantage, when
selecting a university to attend, not
only of a greater number from which
to choose, but also a greater variety
of types of schools. There would
seem to be one other point in this
connection worth noting. This is,
given that the American student is
so often criticized for his tendency
to conform to a dictated style of
thinking and living, the same obser-
tion must be made regarding stu-
dents here.

Something that seems to be of
interest to many people is whether
European students work harder than
American students, or are “more
serious” than American students.
There is a greater emphasis here,
it seems, on following a large num-
ber of classes. Many students here
take some 30-35 hours of classes each
week. There is probably less work
to be done outside for each one of
these classes, however. Often as-
signments are more flexible here, so
that a great deal depends, without
doubt, on what the student chooses
to read, etc. Let me point out that
these observations are based on my
own experience with a limited num-
ber of classes.

While it is probably accurate to
state that French students are, per-
haps, politically a bit to the left of
their American counterparts, they
are socially more conservative. Re-
gardless of what the local yellow
journals may say, among students
here the cha-cha continues to pre-
vail over le tweest.

W&L’s IFC Must Regain
The Respect Of Faculty
And The Student Body

 

Frat Presidents Not Attending Meetings,
Council Hindered By Party Division,
Are Among IFC’s Many Problems

(Editor’s note: EMPHASIS, a regular feature of the
Tuesday Edition, today features what we feel is a very pen-
etrating article on Washington and Lee’s IFC. The article,
written by Associate Editor Ken Lane, is not intended to be
an expose of the IFC, and we hope that it won’t be met by
the student body with that attitude.

It is our feeling that the IFC could be a useful organiza-
tion on the Washington and Lee Campus. We are sorry
to say, however, that the IFC is definitely not fullfilling
its basic obligations to the Student Body and to the frater-
nities.

The IFC, quite frankly, reeks with a general apathetic ap-
pearance. This attitude is supplied not only by the invidivual
members of the IFC, but it is also supplied by the fraternities
themselves. As Mr. Lane points out, the fraternity presi-
dents are required by the IFC Constitution to attend all the
IFC meetings. Do the presidents attend? In some cases the
presidents do attend the meetings but in many others they do
not.

We do not blame the IFC’s problems on its
officers. In our opinion, IFC President Bob Doenges
has done much to elevate this organization this year,
and we, for one, commend him for his excellent ef-
forts.

Our sole purpose in printing this article is to show the
Student Body what the problems that face the IFC actually
are. We can only hope that these problems can, and will
be overcome. This article is continued on Page 2 of today’s
paper, and appears in our regular editorial position.)

By KEN LANE
Associate Editor

When a freshman enters Washington and Lee University one of the
first organizations introduced to him is the Interfraternity Council.

During the first week of college, this Council is seen playing the
prominent role in a very vital significant function—that of operating
Rush Week. Very early in the mind of the student, the
IFC thus comes to occupy a position of high prestige.

However, after the bidding is done and the pledg-
ing is made, the Council undergoes an eclipse and for
some reason submerges into a sort of obscurity amid
other campus activities.

The student, thereafter, sees only slight glimmer-
ings of the organization in an occasional fund drive
or some other perfunctory task. Annually, there is
a revival at mid-year in which a certain sub-commit-
tee of the Council proposes a number of rules for what
is known as Help Week, and these are subsequently
ee voted down. Such has been the rather unenlightened

° history of the IFC in past years.

At one time, the powers of this organization were much more im-
posing, and it has been only recently that its structure has undergone
a great deal of dismantling.

 

The critical blow occurred late in the last decade when mismanage-
ment of the IFC over the social matters of the fraternities was so
blatant that the faculty was forced to deprive the Council of its powers
in that particular domain, Taking over the responsibility where the IFC
left off, the faculty has since instituted the faculty committee on fra-
ternities and a University Proctor.

The Tuesday Staff Speaks .. .

 

EMPHASIS

The IFC was left priority over its other interests, particularly in the
areas of Rush Week, the pledge-training period, and Help Week.
Since the faculty’s intervention in the social management, however,

the Council has been haunted by a sense of being overshadowed by
the Administration.

 

The pressure, whether actual or not, has constantly been the
chief motivating power behind the apparently dacadaisical organization.

This year, principally under the initiative of president Bob Doenges,
the IFC has asserted itself somewhat more outspokenly than in the past.

Having gotten off to a good start with an unusually successful Rush
Week, the council began to show some interest for the first time in the
area of fraternity pledge-training. It has started to view this phase
of fraternity life with a more or less objective approach, and launched
upon what it considers a more progressive and constructive program.

One valid step forward has been the speech given by Mr. Richard
Fletcher, Secretary of the Sigma Nu National Fraternity, before an as-
sembly of the freshmen pledges and their pledge-trainers. The talk em-
phasized the proper relationship which students should develop toward
their university and fraternity life. Above all, Mr. Fletcher spoke out
against the old-fashioned “Clyde Beatty” method of pledge-training.

A second significant measure was the enactment of several regula-
tions in regard to pledge rallies. Through enforcing such restrictions,
the IFC is hoping eventually to steer the pledge program away from the
idea of “beating” a pledge into the fraternity and more toward planning
constructive activities, (These regulations limited the hours in which
rallies could be held.)

IFC Passes

By C. C. FLIPPEN
Associate Editor

New rules concerning
W&L’s Help Week activities
were passed by an 11-7 vote
of the IFC at a meeting last
night.

Since the proposals failed by one
vote to get the necessary two-
thirds, they will not become a per-
manent part of the constitution but
will apply only to this year’s Help
Week.

The following rules will be en-
forced this year:

1. A week of concentrated pledge
activities will continue to exist.

2. While carrying out these ac-
tivities that bind a freshman to his
house, no individual should be
forced to perform deeds that vio-
late his basic sense of human dig-
nity and decency.

3. A “hazard” is clearly defined
as any clear and present danger of
harm to the physical or emotional
process.

4, The highest purpose of Help
Week can be achieved through
constructive activities for the
pledges.

5. Each house must submit a
plan of its proposed pre-initiation
activities to the Help Week Com-
mittee at 9:00 p.m. of the Sunday
night prior to the beginning of
Help Week. All House Presidents
and Pledge Trainers are required
to attend (this year it will be
February 3, at 9 p.m.).

6. A revolving trophy will be
awarded by the Help Week Com-
mittee to the pledge class achiev-
ing the most constructive service
for their fraternity, community,
and University.

Any alleged violation of these
rules by an upperclassman or a
freshman will be submitted to the
judicial committee of the IFC. The
committee will investigate the
charges and determine appropriate
action.

Bob Doenges, president of the
IFC, said that he, and perhaps other
members of the IFC, will visit each
house during Help Week to see
that it is abiding by the new regu-
lations.

The new rules were the result of
proposals formulated by a committee
which met before Christmas to “in-
vestigate ways to stop Hell Week
abuses and to devise a plan of en-
forcement.” In considering the var-
ious proposals, the group attempted

to see how other schools had used | —

Features Senator Albert Gore

§ Tennessee Democrat To Discuss Foreign Affairs

Senator Albert Gore, Democrat from Tennessee, will be the principal speaker at the
Eighth Annual International Relations Week to be held on the Washington and Lee cam-

pus February 13, 14, 15.

Senator Gore will speak in Lee Chapel on Tuesday evening, February 13 at 7:30, the
opening session of the three-day series of talks on important aspects of international relations.

The entire week is under the sponsorship of the International Relations Club, Lance
Tarrance, president and John M. Gunn faculty advisor.

International Relations Week was first begun in 1953-54 under the direction of Dr. Har-
ey Wheeler, professor of political science, now on leave to the Center for the Study of Dem-
ocratic Institutions. The week is intended to stimulate interest in international affairs among
the student body through the presentation of excellent speakers in the field.

In the past years the week has featured such figures as Arnold J. Toynbee; Norman
Thomas; Paul Hoffman, Director of the United Nation’s Special Fund; and Arthur Larson,
Director of the World Rule of Law Center at Duke University.

Mr. Gore’s appearance on the campus will mark the first time, however, that a member of

of the council will be held next
semester in an effort to have these
regulations made a permanent part
of the constitution.

In other IFC action last night the
Social Chairman, Bob Hart, an-
nounced that he will study the re-
lationship between the Dance Board
and the fraternity social functions.

A committee, which is composed
of chairman Bob Hart, SAE; Dave
Swan, Phi Delt; and Dick Herman,
PEP, is part of an attempt to in-
crease attendance at University
Dances and other Dance Board
functions.

In commenting on the purpose of
the committee, Hart said the IFC

would like to work with the Dance
Board officers in an effort to elimi-
nate this situation and hopes to pass
new rules that would bring about
a better relationship between the two
bodies.

The need for a better relationship
arises from the fact that in the last
few years there has been an in-
creasing number of fraternity men
who are not attending the dance
concerts and other university func-
tions, Hart said.

“Our aim,” he added, “would be
to try to present some proposals to
the IFC that would eliminate con-
flicts between fraternity social func-
tions and those of the Dance Board.”

He pointed out that this would
not mean fraternity functions would
be cut out altogether, but would be
an attempt to have a greater per-
centage of University men partici-
pating in the events that take place
on campus.

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

© and-run accident.

Two Phi Gam juniors were in-
volved in a hit-an-run accident
north of Lexington on Route 11 late
Friday night.

Thomas P. Rideout, the driver,
and G. Andy Nea, Jr., owner of
the car, were not seriously injured,
but Nea suffered a _ dislocated
shoulder.

According to Nea, their car ran
into the left rear tires of a flat-bed
trailer truck which had just pulled
out of a restaurant near the in-
tersection of Route 11 and Route
340.

The truck cid not stop after the
collision, he said.

Nea added that the truck did not
have its lights on when it pulled
out into the highway, and Rideout
could not see it in time to stop.

Native of Tennessee

Senator Gore is a native Tennes-
seean, having been born in Gran-
ville, Tennessee in 1907. He gradu-
ated from State Teachers’ College
at Murfreesboro, Tennessee with a
B.S. degree. He received his LL.B.
in 1936 from the night law school
of the Nashville Y.M.C.A. He has
also attended Cumberland Univer-
sity and the University of Tennessee.
After holding several minor posi-
tions in the State, be became com-
missioner of labor for the State dur-
ing 1937-38. He was elected to the
House of Representatives of the 76th
Congress in 1938.

On Important Committees

Senator Gore remained in the
House, where he served on many
important committees, until 1952
when he was elected to the United
States Senate. As the junior senator
from Tennessee, Mr. Gore has
gained membership on several im-
portant committees, among them the
Senate Finance Committee, the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit-
tee, and the Joint Committee on

Library increasing the library seat-
ing space by one-fourth its present
capacity.

Total library seating capacity has
been brought to 300, according to
Henry C. Coleman, Jr., university li-

Opponents Claim Washington & bun Has Unfair Advantage, ‘But It Doesn’t

Center Of Controversy

Washington and Lee’s athletic program was “exposed”
Monday morning.

Our basketball team, which ha sstruggled to a 3-5 record,
is using a pair of ineligible players, according to Jim Barret’s
“Sports Front”’ column in Monday’s Lynchburg News.

Barrett devoted his whole column to Washington and
Lee’s lack of the “spiritual side of law abiding.” He was
quick to point out that W&L is not breaking any written rule,
but he lowered the boom under the old cloak of the “moral
rule.”

The eligibility controversy started because W&L is play-
ing Tom and Jon Supak, who transferred here from William
and Mary last fall (or as Barrett preferred to put it who made

“sudden appearance at Lexington.”’)

W&L athletic director E. P. Twombly today explained
our policy concerning transfers very clearly:

“We feel that if a boy is admitted to Washington and
Lee and wants to participate in sports, he is free to do so as
long as he is eligible to play under the five consecutive years
of eligibility after his initial enrollment rule.

The eligibility rule which is in force in most conferences
states that transfers have to sit out one year after changing
schools. This rule is intended to prevent ‘tramp’ athletes.
We don’t have any ‘tramp’ athletes at W&L. We are the
least likely school in the country to have ‘tramp’ athletes.
(Tramp athletes are athletes who are convinced by one
school to transfer to it from another institution in order to

participate in that school’s athletic contests. The eligibility ,

rules are aimed at keeping schools from doing this by taking
a year of eligibility away from the player transfers.)”’

Since Washington and Lee is not presently in an ath-
letic conference, it isn’t forced to obey the rules of any con-
ference, technically or morally.

In fact, it morally obeys the rule anyway. W&L didn’t go
to the Supaks. They came to it.

 

 

IFC History Review

(Continued from page one)

The third measure that indicates progress is the introduction of the
new Help Week proposals, though we should wait to see if it bears any
fruit before patting the IFC on the back. For it is evident that the pro-
posals are vague on certain points and they passed through the houses
labelled as an “appeasement” policy for the increasingly indignant fac-
ulty.

On the other hand, if the constructive aspects are taken seriously,
the proposals can truly be considered effective.

The unfortunate dilemma of the IFC at present is the fact that it does
have the machinery to accomplish a great deal more, but it cannot get
the sanction of the individual fraternities. The source of the problem, as
it generally is with any organization on the decline, is a deep-seated in-
difference.

One evidence of this indifference is exhibited in the attitude of the
individual members.

According to the IFC Constitution, membership is supposed to con-
sist of the fraternity presidents and one junior representative from each
house. This stipulation is being widely disregarded, however.

Many representatives are not juniors, but politically ambitious sopho-
mores,

The fraternity presidents are ceasing to find it worth their while to
attend the meetings, and in some cases they have neglected to show up
all year.

Much is indicated also by the party divisions within the council. It
is an apparent tendency for members to stick blindly to the interest of
their own party. Consequently when elections are made for the four
big offices of the Council, the successful candidates are consistently mem-
bers of the University Party, which holds the majority of votes.

When the ballots are cast, the vote is inevitably 10 to 8, representing
the number of houses of each respective party. Seemingly, the IFC has
become a convenient tool of the University Party to boost its candidates
to higher political echelons.

Further hindering the effectiveness of the organization is the com-
mon practice of referring issues back to the individual houses. Reluctant
to take the responsibility in its own hands, the IFC has resorted to a
rather inefficient system.

Seemingly the IFC fails to realize that issues cannot be adequately
presented in the less formal atmosphere of chapter meetings and con-
sequently the measures are subject to the caprices of the individual
houses. Perhaps in this sense, the IFC has grown too democratic.

A Field where the IFC particularly lacks interest is that of pledge-
training. Though it has plenty of potential with which to play a truly
constructive role during this four-month period, the Council has failed
to act. With the possible exception of the Homecomings Decorations Con-
test, it has done little except to rule on what the fraternities can’t do.

The IFC has thereby become merely a negative force, failing to use
its influence to steer pledging into constructive channels though it has
the power. The IFC, for example, would be an effective medium through
which fraternities could apply pledge projects to something organized and
meaningful like community service.

The IFC can serve vital functions in other ways. For example, listed
in the freshman handbook as an active organization on campus is a group
called the Freshman Advisory Council, supposedly consisting of the pres-
idents of the pledge classes and elected representatives of the non-fra-
ternity men.

“Its ultimate aim,” the handbook states, “is the unification of the en-
tire freshman class by working through the individual fraternity and
non-fraternity representatives.”

It would undoubtedly be a noble undertaking for the IFC to sponsor
such an organization and make it an actual entity on campus—if it could.

Perhaps, we don’t know however, the solution to the organization of
the IFC is that it needs to be built on a similar structure as the EC,
which is a limited group of select individuals theoretically not subject to
political whims.

Whatever the case may be, the Council is faced with the impending
challenge to regain the respect of the faculty and student body as a vital
and responsible organization.

The Russian economy has been described
succinctly as “totalitarianism harnessed to the
task of rapid economic growth.” Rapid indus-
trialization has been the primary end of the
Soviet planners ever since the first Five Year
Plan was launched on October 1, 1929. More-
over, a set of institutions has been created to
achieve this objective. While the West may
strongly disapprove of the means employed,
it must be admitted that the Soviet Union has
advanced rapidly.

In 1928 the Soviet economy represented a
very backward economic system. This situation
has markedly changed. As the result of over
three decades of forced industrialization, the
Soviet Union stands second only to the United
States in terms of industrial output. In recent
years, the gross national product of Russia has
been growing at slightly over twice the United
States’ rate (7 per cent versus 3 per cent an-
nually). Clearly we must recognize this growth
as a remarkable achievement. It also represents
a challenge and a threat.

Soviet Growth: The Pattern

The growth of the Soviet economy has not
been balanced. To obtain needed capital for
invesment, the planners have been forced to
maintain a low rate of output of consumer
goods. To illustrate: the share of consumption
in the Soviet economy is less than 50 per cent
of the total output (GNP), whereas the share of
consumption in the American economy is
slightly over 65 per cent. Per Capita supplies of
food, clothing, and housing space are extremely
low. The service industries are virtually un-
known.

Soviet agricultural policy has not been
a notable success, with the result that
this sector of the economy is the most in-
efficient. In part this has been due to the
collective farm system which has offered,
to date, an insurmountable obstacle to
improvements in efficiency. In part the
low agricultural output can be attributed
to poor planning. Stalin, who showed lit-
tle interest in this sector of the economy,
chose to use the available capital for in-
vestments in other areas. There was little
use of fertilizer and chemical agents and
a low level of mechanization. The failure
of the Soviet agricultural policy, however,
is not inevitable, as Krushchev set out to
prove in 1953.

It is in the industrial sector that the rate of
economic grpwth has been so pronounced.
Russia has been devoting a significantly greater
share of its productive resources to investment
(25 versus 20 per cent) than has the United
States. In turn, this investment has been di-
rected mainly toward heavy industry. Recent
estimates indicate that Soviet industrial out-
put is 45 per cent of ours. If Russia can con-
tinue her present 7 per cent rate of growth and
if the United States continues to grow at 3
per cent, then Russian industrial output will
match ours within twenty-five years.

Soviet Growth: The Problems

 

In terms of productivity the Russian econ-

bility only came up after Tom Supak played his best game of
the year, scoring 30 points as W&L took a 78-74 overtime
victory from LYNCHBURG COLLEGE.

Barrett suggested that the Mason-Dixon Conference,
which supplies a large number of W&L’s opponents, should
pressure wayward W&L into conforming with the confer-
ence’s transfer rule. This is absurd. Why should W&L obey
a Mason-Dixon Conference rule when it isn’t even a mem-
ber of that conference? The answer is, it should not.

Barrett said that the use of the Supaks gives Washing-
ton and Lee an unfair advantage over its opponents. But he
failed to mention the advantages W&L’s opponents have

Most of W&L’s opponents give either athletic scholar-
ships or “encouragement” scholarships for athletics. W&L
gives neither athletic scholarships nor
scholarships for athletics. Doesn’t this fact alone give a much
larger advantage to Washington and Lee’s opponents than
the Supaks give to Washington and Lee?

We also wonder: just how many of the players on the

“encouragement”

Mason-Dixon Conference teams could be admitted to Wash-

ington and Lee in the first place?

Washington and Lee is trying to participate in athletics

omy lags even farther behind the United States.
Problems in planning, organization, incentives
and motivations have all been responsible for
waste and inefficiency. While some industries
compare favorably with those of the United
States, evidence suggests both imbalance and
unevenness in Soviet planning.

This does not imply, however, that the
Soviet economy is so wasteful that it cannot
compete economically with the capitalistic
economies. There is every reason to believe
that Russian planning is becoming more ra-
tional and efficient. When the philosophy of
Karl Marx has interfered with the Plan,
it has been brushed aside. Soviet stores now
sell on credit. To aid in allocating investment
funds, interest on capital has been allowed. And
Soviet producers usually are expected to show
a profit on their operations. The famous labor
theory of value seems to be something of a

on
textbook curiosity. There has even been a
move, since the death of Stalin, toward the
decentralization of decision-making authority
within the Russian economy, coupled with an
increase in managerial freedom.

Soviet Growth: The Future

It is always difficult, and dangerous, to pre-
dict the future. Futhermore, the long-term
prospects for economic growth in the Soviet
Union are conflicting. Assuming no drastic
changes in the Soviet military effort, the out-
look for the next few years is a continuation
of a high average annual rate of growth of
perhaps 6 to 7 per cent. This prediction is
based upon four factors.

(1) As the stated objective of the Soviet
planners is industrialization, it seems unlikely
that a substantial decline in the rate of invest-
ment will be tolerated. Khrushchev has prom-
ised to improve the welfare of the Soviet con-
sumer, but this will be a gradual development.

(2) Increased emphasis upon improve-
ments in technology and automation can
be expected, leading to productivity ad-
vances. The Soviet Union has forcefully
demonstrated that she has the scientific
and technical skills to accompany this
goal, This emphasis is required because

it appears unlikely that the nonagricul-
tural labor forces will increase as rapidly
during the next ten years as it has in the
last ten, Consequently, a significant por-
tion of any increase in output will have to
come from the growth of productivity.

(3) Khrushchev is placing greater emphasis
upon increasing agricultural output. With bet-
ter planning and more capital, Soviet agricul-
tural output should rise in the next few years.
But this will require more capital, thereby
leaving less for the producers’ goods indus-
tries. As a result, the problem of finding
adequate investment funds will be intensified.

(4) The probability of greater efficiency in
the planning and administration of the Soviet
economy must be taken into account. Soviet
planners have shown no aversion to change
when greater growth can be achieved.

  
 
   
   
   
   
    

  

Soviet Growth: The Implications

The prediction of a high rate of growth
for the Soviet Union in the next few years
means that the Soviet national product will
continue to increase relative to that of the
United States. The implications of this predic-
tion have been well stated by Bornstein:

“Such an increase in the size of the Soviet
economy compared with that of the United
States need not in itself be considered alarm-
ing. More important is the significance of a
rapid rate of economic growth for the world
position of the U.S.S.R. A larger, and rapidly
growing, national product will provide the
U.S.S.R. a greater economic base for a strong
military posture, for further scientific and tech-
nical progress, for greater trade and foreign
aid, and for an improvement in the living
conditions of the Soviet population. Futher-
more, an uninterrupted high rate of growth will
be prominently cited in Soviet efforts to con-
vince underprivileged countries that they
should emulate the Soviet ‘model’ in their de-
velopment programs. In all these ways, a high
rate of growth will strengthen the economic,
military, and political position of the U.S.S.R.
on the world scene. The consequences of this
enhanced Soviet position will be of great im-
portance to the United States and the rest of
the free world.”

SPORTS
FRONT

By JIM BARRETT

Unfair Advantage Charged
Against WGL Athletics

(Editor’s Note: The following article is a reprint of Jim
Barrett’s sports column which appeared in the Monday, Jan-
uary 15, 1962, issue of the Lynchburg News.)

Washington and Lee University’s basketball team is off
to what might be considered a slow start with a 3-5 season rec-
ord, but it would probably be even less impressive if the Gener-
als used the same rules of eligibility that most of their oppon-
ents are forced to obey. They don’t.

Since W&L is an athletic indepe-*
pendent it is legally free to set up
its own rules concerning who may
play on its teams. Athletic officials in
Lexington have taken this freedom
to heart and in doing so have made
their eligibility restrictions much
looser than any of the conference-
tied opponents they meet.

Twins Spark Generals

The most obvious use of Wash-
ington and Lee’s_§self-determination
can be found on the General basket-
ball in a pair of twins, Tom and Jon
Supak. This flashy pair of twins has
had much to do with what success
W&L has managed to garner during
the basketball campaign to date.

But the rub comes in (and the
News has been assured by a very
reliable source that it has been
mentioned on several occasions by
coaches playing W&L) with the
twins’ sudden appearance at Lex-
ington.

Both of these lads were pace set-
ters last season on the William and
Mary freshman team. If these fellows
had transferred to a conference re-
lated school and most independent
institutions they would have been
forced to sit out a year before they
could play basketball for their new
alma mater.

Not so at W&L, With its power to
establish its own standards, W&L
has declared these players eligible.
Now, if by some miracle the Gener-
als should enter some National Col-
legiate Athletic Association sponsor-
ed event, they would have to make
the trip without the Supak twins.
The NCAA would consider the 6-1,
180-pound sophomore backcourt duo
ineligible.

NCAA official Art Bergstrom as-
sured this columnist last week that
a decisive majority of independent
colleges across the nation do ob-
serve transfer rule. Bergstrom’s
statement would indicate that the
Generals are among collegiate
basketball’s tiny flock of black
sheep.

 

 

E. P. “Cy” Twombly, W&L ath-
letic Director, took a different out-
look in a telephone conversation
early last week. Twombly feels that
the academic requirements for W&L
are rigid enough to serve as the
entire standard for athletic compe-
tition.

No one would deny that Washing-
ton and Lee has set up high ac-
ademic standards for intercollegiate
competition, BUT is it fair for them
to use this as the only rule for
participation when all but one team
on its schedule must observe this
transfer doctrine set up by their
conferences? Norfolk William and
Mary is the lone team on the Gen-
eral slate that is also an indepen-
dent.

Unfair Advantage Charged

As some of W&L’s foes have not-
ed, this lack of standardized rules
at the Lexington college to conform
to most nationally recognized poli-
cies has given the Generals an un-
fair advantage over their opponents.

Perhaps W&L’s membership in
the newborn College Conference
with Sewanee, Southwestern at
Memphis and Centre will make a
difference. But then again, this
new loop seems bent on developing
a very loose relationship that
might well allow each school to
determine its own way.

Since over half of W&L’s games
are played with members of the
Mason - Dixon Conference, this
league could do much to pressure
the Generals into conformity if they
so wished. The conference meets in
March and some move might well be
taken there to let Washington and
Lee know where it stands with the
M-D schools on this issue. Should
these schools decide to get real
tough on the subject, W&L might
find itself in quite a quandry when
it comes to scheduling in the future.

This year the General schedule is
dotted with no less than 11 games

R-M Tops Generals, 62-57

Washington and Lee’s basketball
team was red hot at the foul line
Saturday but a poor percentage from
the floor spelled its 62-57 downfall
to Randolph-Macon.

The Generals sank an amazing 19
of 19 free throws, an about face
from their usual efforts at the chari-
ty stripe. But free throws weren't
enough to whip a blistering second
half offensive by the Yellow Jackets.

The Jackets sank 14 of 22 shots
from the floor the second half—a
percentage of 63.4—to erase a
35-26 W&L halftime lead.

 

Paced by Captain Bip Fauber
and new-found star Tom Supak, the
Generals broke away late in the
opening half for a nine point cush-
ion.

Randolph - Macon narrowed the
W&L lead to three points with two
minutes left in the first half, but
three baskets by Supak shot the
Generals way ahead.

After intermission the Generals
upped their margin to as much as
12 points. Then disaster struck.

well as individual standouts to do
the job against W&L’s unsubsidized
but willing team.

Jackets were pouring in 18 and
taking a 45-44 lead.

For the next six minutes the game
see-sawed back and forth. A jump
shot by Louis Paterno with 4:30
left put the Generals back into the
game for the last time, making the
score 55-55.

Going into a stall, Randolph-
Macon worked for the good shots
and big Frank Kaminski collected
two buckets and a free throw to
salt away the win.

   
   

 

Howie Martin (42) goes up for a rebound.

The loss dropped the Generals’
recrod to 3-5. Their next game is
tomorrow night at Bridgewater. Sat-
urday they meet Norfolk William
and Mary here at 8:30.

Tom Supak captured top scoring
honors for the third straight game
with 18 points. Fauber had 15 and
Paterno, nine .

Fauber, again playing a terrific
game on the boards, collected 18
rebounds. He grabbed 16 in the first
half, but had to sit out most of the
second half because of foul trouble.

Fancy Dress Costume Sales
Hit All-Time High This Year

Totaling 504, costumes sales
for this year’s Fancy Dress
nearly doubled the number
sold last year, Dance Board
Vice President Frank Young
reported today.

Reflecting upon the increased in-
terest in this year’s Fancy Dress
Ball among the student body, Young
went further to predict that 1500
people, including faculty members,

guests, and townspeople, will attend
the Ball Friday night.

One of the reasons for the in-
creased participation in Fancy
Dress from outside the student
body is the change in Dance Board
policy regulating ticket sales.

Students wishing to bring guests
from other colleges to Fancy Dress
may purchase tickets for them at re-
duced rates.

This new ruling requires only
that the student purchasing tickets
must give his guest’s name and col-
lege, and pay for the tickets in
advance. This may be done up until
Friday, January 26.

The reduced rates will be $5 for
the Concert and $10 for the Con-
cert and both dances. Admission at
the door will be $7.50 for the Con-
cert and $5 for each of the dances.

Dance Board President Steve
Galef said today that students who
wish to get student tickets should
mail a check or cash with the re-
turn address to Box 458, Lexing
ton.

Tickets will be sold at the door

for persons who are not students,
and the rates are as follows: Con-
cert, $7.50; Dances, $5.00 each.

Having concluded arrangements
for the use of the Commons, Young
noted that the only stipulation is
that there shall be no parking allow-

ed on either side of the street in|»

front of the Commons. He said that

the Dance Board urges full student]
cooperation in this matter since the |:

Dance Board use of the Commons
is on a trial basis.

Plans Underway

Plans are well underway for dec-
oration of the Commons in harmony
with the “High Society” theme. The
atmosphere will be that of an Inaug-

ural Ball or some similar affair of | §

state. Costumes will be full dress.

Although no refreshments will be |:

served in the Commons, the Co-op

will be open during the dance and |*

refreshments may be purchased
there.

$1500 Grant

The Shell Oil Company has chosen

Washington and Lee to share in its
program of “Shell Assists” to higher
education for the third consecutive
year.
The receipt of the Shell gift of
$1,500 was announced today by Pres-
ident Fred C. Cole. The money in-
cludes $500 of unrestricted funds,
$500 for general faculty development
and $500 for professional develop-
ment of individual faculty members
in engineering, mathematics and the
physical sciences.

Washington and Lee is among
nearly 100 private colleges and uni-

“The university is most grateful
for this additional support from one
of our four leading corporations,”
President Cole said. “The cumulative
effect of the Shell program is of
great meaning to private higher
education.”

But Washington and Lee is oper-

rules that few of its opponents
are free to use.

While the General athletic depart-

that W&L leaves a little to be de-

Law Group
Selects Stow
As Preident

In an election held last
week, Charles Stow was named
president of the Student Bar
Association for the second
semester. Other officers elected
were John Petzold, vice pres-
ident; Richard Radis, secre-
tary; and Larry Lambert,
treasurer.

In a similar election, Stow’s wife,
Mrs. Jacqueline Stow was named
president of the Law Wives’ Asso-
ciation. Mrs. Charles Broll was
named vice president; Mrs. Peter
Dauk, secretary; and Mrs. Richard
Cantebury, treasurer.

Stow, a law student from Phoenix-
ville, Pennsylvania, will head the
Association until his graduation in
June. Stow and the other officers
will be installed at the Associa-
tion’s next meeting. He will replace
out-gowing president, Robert Frank.

Stow commented on the Associa-
tion that it “is an organization that
is growing, and it is my ambition
to have it reach its highest peak
this semester in student participa-

- ton.”

Membership Is Voluntary

The Student Bar Association dif-
fers from a regular student body
in that membership is voluntary,
but according to Stow, “We have
almost 100 per cent membership.”

The W&L Student Bar Associa-
tion is in the Fourth District along
with such schools as Duke, William
and Mary, and North Carolina. This
district is, in turn, a member of the
national association.

The main purposes of the Asso-
ciation are to run the affairs of the
law school student body and to co-
ordinate the student body and law
faculty.

A big project of the group each
year is a mock trial held in March.
Dr. C. V. Laughlin acts as judge
each year.

SBA An Active Group

Other projects of the Association
are presenting honors and awards
for excellence in various aspects of
law, sponsoring films, placing stu-
dents in business and law firms, and
sponsoring social activities for the
law school. The two main social
activities are the Christmas Dance
and the Spring Dance.

The group also sponsors a publi-
cation, the Washington and Lee
Lawyer, which it sends to alumni
and law firms.

Stow’s wife will officially become
president of the Law Wives Associa-
tion at the beginning of next semes-
ter. This association is composed
of the wives of law students, and its
purpose is to carry out various pro-
jects in behalf of the law school.

The Association’s main project for
this year is a benefit bridge party
to be held early in March. The
party is open to all bridge players,
and there will be prizes donated by
Lexington merchants. Many of the
prizes will be aimed at attracting
student participation. The purpose
of the project is to raise funds for
a law school scholarship.

Other projects of the wives in-
clude preparing sandwiches for law
students during exams, preparing
Christmas baskets for needy fami-
lies, and serving refreshments at law
school lectures.

 

Dr. Coulling Recovering
From Serious Operation

Dr. Sidney M. B. Coulling, assist-
ant professor in the Washington
and Lee English department, under-
went a successful major operation
January 8 and has been improving
steadily since then. A victim of a
serious inflamation of the lower
intestine, Coulling will probably not
return to his classes until next fall.

The operation was performed at
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. Since
Coulling had to stop teaching, his
classes have been divided among
other members of the department.
Department head Dr. A. Ross Bor-
den said that other profesors will
continue to share the work.

Coulling is a member of Wash-
ton and Lee’s class of 1946, and
graduated magna cume laude and
Phi Beta Kappa. He received his
doctorate from the University of
North Carolina.

Fancy Dress Performers

Commended

By LARRY MEEKS

The Dave Brubeck Quartet, who
will play a concert here Fancy
Dress, was named top instrumental
group in the February issue of
Playboy magazine. Each member of
the group placed individually with
Brubeck himself taking first place
among the pianists. Paul Desmond
placed second in the alto sax cate-
gory, Joe Morello placed third
among drummers, and Gene Wright
placed tenth among bases.

Duke Ellington, who will be play-
ing for the Fancy Dress Ball, was
named top band leader in the poll
taken of the 1961 winners. He re-
ceived second place honors in the
readers’ poll.

Si Zenter, signed for the Saturday
dance, also placed among band
leaders, an unusual feat for a band
organized for less than a year.

 

Jenks Preparing

Book In Vienna

By SHANNON JUNG

Washington and Lee’s Dr. William
A. Jenks, who received a research
grant for study abroad, is presently
working in Vienna, compiling a
study of Austro-Hungarian political
and economic developments in the
late nineteenth century.

Jenks will return in September.
He left in mid-summer to begin the
work. The book which will result
from his work is a scholarly one, to
be read by professors and lecturers
who must present the material to
others.

Members of the W&L faculty have
traditionally received research aid
of this type, aimed at better inter-
pretation and more recent material
for classroom lectures. Dr. Jenks’
grant, a Social Science Research
Grant, is sponsored by the Social
Science Research Foundation. Com-
petition for the grants is very keen
among many scholars of established
reputation. The Research Founda-
tion, a private organization, pro-
vides living and travel costs for a
year of research.

This is not the first grant which
Dr. Jenks, a member of the facul-
ty since 1946, has won. In 1960,
Vienna and the Young Hitler traced
Viennese influence in shaping Hit-
ler’s character. Dr. Jenks’ doctoral
dissertation at Columbia, Austrian
Electorial Reform of 1907, written
on the introduction of universal
suffrage to Austria in 1907, was pub-
lished in 1950,

 

These awards are made annually
by Playboy in their Playboy All-

Stars poll, in which thousands of
votes are tabulated.

Cocktail Party Opens

This year’s Fancy Dress Weekend
will be kicked-off with a cocktail
party in honor of Fancy Dress presi-
dent Bill Ide. The party, to be
given by Kappa Alpha, will be held
at the Moose Lodge on February 2
from 4 to 6 p.m. The event will fea-
ture the TNT Tribble Combo with
Phil Flowers, vocalist. Arrangements
were made by FD vice president
Robin Norfleet.

Friday evening at 9 p.m. in the
Commons, Duke Ellington and his
Orchestra will provide music for
dancing. He will play until 1 a.m.

All students wishing to see the
figure must be in the Commons by
9 p.m. as the doors will be locked
during the figure. Fifteen hundred
persons are expected for this event
including students, faculty and ad-
ministration, interested citizens of
Lexington and surrounding com-
munities, and the press.

Jerry Hyatt, FD vice president
in charge of the figure, announced
that the figure will be presented
similiar to a presentation at an In-
augural Ball emphasizing _ this
year’s theme, “High Society.”

On Saturday afternoon Doremus
Gym will play host to the Dave
Brubeck Quartet from 3 to 5. The
concert promises to be one of the
highlights of the weekend. Dress for
the concert is conventional.

Saturday night Doremus Gym will
again be the center of activity on the
campus as Si Zenter provides dance
music. This performance marks the
first professional appearance of Si
Zenter and his group in the South.

Special Price for Visitors

Students coming from _ other
schools have one week in which to
purchase their tickets if they wish
to get them at reduced rates. Before
January 26, tickets to the concert are
$5, and tickets to the concert and
both dances are $10. After January
26, the price will be $7.50 for the
concert and $5 for each of the
dances.

Tickets may be secured by mail
by writing Dance Board, Box 458,
Lexington, Virginia.

“T hope that student participation
in the Fancy Dress activities—es-
pecially Saturday’s—will be good as
future Dance Board and faculty
decisions will be influenced by it,”
was Dance Board president Steve
Galef’s comment on the activities.

 

the awards will be given to those
interested in college teaching as a
career.

These prestigious fellowships are
normally three-year awards, pro-
viding a stipend of $2,000 for the
first year and higher amounts for
the second and third years.

A list of the graduate schools par-
ticipating in this program has just
been released. A copy may be ex-
amined in Dean Pusey’s Office.

The fellowships are available in
the humanities, social sciences, biol-
ogical sciences, physical sciences,
mathematics and engineering.

 

 

Leyburn Scheduled
To Publish History
Of Scotch - Irish

By SHANNON JUNG

Dr. James G. Leyburn of Wash-
ington and Lee will culminate five
years of work with the publication
next spring of a new book entitled
The Scotch-Irish: A Social History.

Dr. Leyburn, head of the W&L so-
ciology department, has worked on
the 400-page book in Scotland and
Ireland as well as in the United
States. His work will be published
by the University of North Caro-
lina Press.

The fact that the Scotch-Irish
make up the largest ancestral seg-
ment of the U.S. population, next
to the English, is more than ade-
quate justification of Dr. Leyburn’s
treatment of the topic. He divides
the book into 3 sections:

First is the story of the typical
Scot in the lowlands before 1600,
showing his economic, religious, and
political situation. The book shifts
to its second section in dealing with
large numbers of Scotts who moved
to Northern Ireland after 1600.
Finally, the book tells the story of
the 200,000 Scotch-Irish who mi-
grated to America between 1718 and
1775. These immigrants, landing
mostly around Philadelphia, traveled
West through Pennsylvania and to
the Piedmont of the Carolinias.

The book shows the condition of
these immigrants as they moved
from Ireland to America. Their evo-
lution is the main concern of the
book, but it also deals with Amer-
ican politics, economics, and relig-
ion in relation to its subject.

Fishwick’s Books
Are Condemned

Alfred Percy, a Lynchburg histor-
ian and publisher, accused W&L
History Professor Marshall Fish-
wick of joining the “hand-biting
association” in his writings and lec-
tures on Virginia and General Lee.

Percy made his accusation before
the annual Lee-Jackson-Murray
birthday luncheon of the Old Do-
minion chapter of the United
Daughters of the confederacy on
Wednesday.

Percey’s speech, entitled “Lee—
the Emblem and Hope for Security,”
attacked Fishwick’s attitude in his
several books on Virginia.

In Percy’s words, “The writings
are used to undermine the position
of the South in general and Vir-
ginia in particular. It is sheer prop-
aganda. Lee was no failure. He was
an emblem for security and hope for
the South.”

“T feel there is no reason for a
‘Johnny come Lately’ to try to un-
dermine the character of so fine
a figure in history. Lee was not
chosen to head Washington and
Lee, then known as Washington Col-
as a figurehead, but because he in
those hard times, was a beacon of
hope, for security of the youth of
the battered South. He did not fail.”

Upon learning of Percy’s remarks,

(Continued on page 4)

 

“imaginative, sometimes bold plan-
ning” and his wisdom and foresight.

Cole was able to speak of many
improvements in the W&L program
in his report to the University.
These included the two new build-
ings which are under construction
and the IBM computer which has
been installed. He called the re-
quirements of College Entrance
Examination Board Achievement
Tests for all applicants another step
forward.

The addition of the Warner Schol-
arships for pre-medical students
was mentioned, as was the continued
growth of the Robert E. Lee Re-
search Program.

Regarding the recent shift in ad-
ministration, Cole cited the appoint-
ment of Dr. E. C. Atwood as Dean
of Students, and said Dean Atwood’s
service will permit Dean Gilliam to
devote his talents and energy to the
increasingly complex admission
problem.

Cole praised the formation of the
College Athletic Conference as an
indication of progress in another
field, saying he hoped its success
would help to restore a proper
perspective to some phases of in-
tercollegiate athletics. He also com-
plimented the football team and
the coaching staff for the honors
they have won.

“Many persons involved in higher
education,” said Cole, “are con-
cerned today over the increasing
difficulty which scientists and hu-
manists seem to have in communi-
eating with and understanding each
other.” While pushing for great im-
provement in the science program,
Washington and Lee will not force
an imbalance in favor of scientific
emphasis; scientists and humanists
must learn to live together.

Cole stated that W&L must teach
students to “understand better the
scientific world which none of us
can escape, yet understand it with
out sacrifice of ...ability to appre-
ciate non-scientific values.”

Western culture has seen the
“scientific revolution” cause a split
between the scientists and “tradi-
tionalists,’ humanitarians. While
the scientists are the “significant
force in our future,” most people
will remain on the other side of
the fence.

If Western peoples are experienc-
ing difficulty in assimilating the
continuing scientific revolution, the
Soviet Union may have already
bannished humanist and cultural
progress in favor of science. Soviet
education succeeds in developing
the scientific mind at the expense
of the ability to understand social
and political problems.

The United States National Stu-
dent Association passed a platform
of 78 declarations of policy at its
14th National Student Congress last
August; their policy has been and
will be disseminated as representa-
tive of American student opinion
before the public and before such
groups as the American Council on
Education, the International Stu-
dent Conference, the United States
Commission for UNESCO (the
United Nations committee on edu-
cation), the American Committee for
the United Nations, the Council on
Student Travel, the World Universi-
ty Service, the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare,
and Congressional committees.

This impressive list of connections
easily makes the NSA the most im-

 

portant U.S. student confederation.

 

 

' Lee’s Administration Praised
As ‘Bold, Wise And Foresighted’

Dr. Fred C. Cole told a Founder’s Day University Assem-

said that “‘the state of the University is good.”

Forensic Meet
Hears Mosby
Wednesday

By MALCOLM MORRIS

A challenging speech by Leyburn
Mosby and a debate on national
labor unions highlighted the For-
ensic Union meeting Wednesday
night.

After an introduction by Julian
Markham, Mosby, a senior, spoke on
“America’s Challenge.” In the speech
he urged that Americans realize
and use their abilities to the fullest.

The debate concerned the National
Debate Question for this school
year, Resolved: That labor organi-
zations should be under the juris-
diction of antitrust legislation.
Sophomores Bill Noell and Joe
Volpe debated the affirmative
against negative team Charles Mc-
Cord, junior, and Robin Wood, sen-
ior.

Non-participating members of
Washington and Lee’s debate team
served as judges. Judges Al Eckes
and Jay Clark voted for the affirma-
tive on the basis of general impres-
sion. Bill Boardman dissented, vot-
ing negative because of the nega-
tive’s clear organization and argu-
ment. A vote of all present totaled
24-13 in favor of the affirmative,
supporting the split decision.

Faculty advisor William Chaffin,
always on the outlook for debating
skill, especially noted the fine de-
bating on the part of Volpe, a
novice to W&L debating.

The Forensic Union meets periodi-
cally to discuss topics of timely in-
terest and of special interest to the
university.

 

Freshman Dorm, Gym
Scene of Several Thefts

Bob Murray, Washington and Lee
University proctor, expressed con-
cern today over the incidence of
petty larceny in the school’s gym-
nasium.

The proctor stated that since the
Thanksgiving Holidays a total of
twelve wallets have been stolen or
rifled in the lockerroom of the gym-
nasium,

The University’s Freshman dormi-
tory has also been the scene of a
considerable amount of thievery.

Murray says that he has no clue
as to who the culprit may be, but
he hopes to uncover the mystery
soon,

The policies of NSA are entirely

the much-publicized propaganda

General Lee’s University Today

Each year, on January 19, the regular class work of the
University is suspended and the president addresses the faculty
and the student body on the present state of the University,
in honor of Robert E. Lee’s birthday.

General Lee, of course, is primarly remembered for the
greatness of character which he brought to the presidency of
Washington College. His personal honesty and self-discipline
shone so brightly that everyone connected with Washington
and Lee is honored by their association with his university.

In a time when the educational system of the United
States is in flux, and when we face problems at home and in
international affairs that equal in magnitude those of the mid-
nineteenth century, it would be well for us to consider care-
fully Lee’s example and his heritage to us today.

We suspect he would be very pleased with the University,
and would feel that the shortcomings are far outweighed by the
good points.

His injunction that “‘all our students are gentlemen’”’ is
still honored by the faculty and the administration, if not by the
students. Our professors treat us like adults and we have been
allowed an even larger measure of self-government, by the
formation of the new Student Control Committee. General
Lee would have been vastly proud of the University’s decision
to drop subsidized athletics and form a new league in which
the members have “full respect for the integrity of the other
members. That is a page out of Lee’s book.

He would have taken a justifiable pride in the success of
our football team, but would probably not have worried too
much about the relative lack of success of some of our other
teams, on the theory that participation in manly sports for a
large number of students was the important thing. What a dis-
appointment it would be, though, for the good General to see
the glorified game periods which pass for physical education
here. Or the shoddy conditions of Doremus gymnasium, the
playing fields, and the tennis courts.

We think that General Lee would have been pleased with
the new science buildings going up behind the Law School, for
he saw in science a way for the conquered South to regain her

economic strength. Washington and Lee experienced a sound
physical development during his presidency.

General Lee could come back to see the Commerce,
Journalism, and Law schools which were added to the Univer-
sity under him still flourishing, if somewhat divorced from
the work of the rest of the school.

The Robert E. Lee research grants have proven a great
stimulus to the academic work of the University in their first
year of operation and will probably turn out to be one of the
most important innovations of the past few years.

Under President Cole, there have been a number of
minor improvements in the administration of the University,
which should prove telling in their total effect.

Far and away the most encouraging aspect of the Univer-
sity at present is the feeling that the new president is anxious
to have professors remain active in the scholarship of their re-
spective fields. The surprising number of new courses, as yet
unannounced, that will appear in the spring catalogue should
be evidence enough of the healthy intellectual atmosphere on
campus.

Yet, with all these signs of redoubled growth at W&L,
there seems something lacking. The missing quality seems to us
to be Lee’s sense of mission, of the importance of our work
here. Everyone pays lip service to “our present crisis,” but
no one has shown the courage and devotion of Lee in attempt-
ing to face the crisis. May we be specific?

The Board of Trustees, in October turned down a request
from a student group, which had been recommended favorably
by a faculty committee, to hear Integrationist Minister Martin
Luther King speak here. The most reasonable justification
given for the act was that W&L would lose some wealthy
donors by inviting Dr. King. Frankly, we would be willing to
give up a few very badly needed new buildings or professor-
ships rather than lose our right to hear whom we want to speak
on campus.

Further, the furor in the fall avoided the real question.
Just how should we stand on integration? To a university that

has chosen to emphasize our Southern tradition, the future of
race relations in the South should be a prime concern. We
think it would be a mistake to integrate W&L at the present
time, but we should at least concern ourselves more deeply
with this complex and explosive issue. Should we fail to face it,
we will be abdicating our responsibility to provide the future
leadership of the South and of the nation. For integration
is the biggest issue in the United States today, and will in all
probability continue to be so in our lifetimes.

President Cole chose to emphasize Washington and Lee’s
progress in the sciences and her hopes for their future here
in today’s “state of the University” speech. In the process,
he pointed out another issue that we are just beginning to deal
with: the divorce between the sciences and the humanities. The
University has given the freshman mathematics program a
shot in the arm and there will be a course offered in the history
department next year in history of science and technology.
But the present science requirements for a W&L degree do
not assure sound acquaintance of science on the part of the
graduates. The whole problem has been besmogged by an
unfortunate parochialism on the part of both scientists and
humanists. Each is reluctant to allow the other an entrance
into his own area, to give up one bit of his present hold on the
student’s time. All of us will have to concern ourselves in-
creasingly with the application of science in business and the
professions. It seems unfortunate that the Washington and
Lee student remains so ignorant in these areas. (See the inter-
view with Dr. Shillington on this page today for one faculty
view of the problem.)

Washington and Lee is cautiously bringing her curriculum
up to date. But in this area and in others of great importance,
such as the teaching of foreign languages and of geography,
she is still doing an inadequate job. The acid test for our sense
of purpose will be in our response to the needs of United States
leadership in a small, small world. May we justify General Lee’s
faith in this University by moving forward courageously and
confidently into the second half of the twentieth century, as
he brought us into the second half of the nineteenth.

Love And Life In South Viet Nam

By Howard Slater

Tuesday night I made a profound
error by tuning in on Science’s
impediment to daily assignments.
The highlight of my viewing eve-
ning was a saga about a dedicated
young Peace Corpsman in Viet
Nam, on “Also Presents.” Fred As-
taire was the host (hah!). It seems
that the stout-hearted young Amer-
ican isn’t so ugly after all. In fact,
he’s a great guy: he helps the vil-
lagers, works with the villagers,
loves one of the villagers (yeecch)
and so on. But those ratty Com-
munists come along and try to take
over. Lover boy is helpless. The
villagers won’t fight. Communism
has won another ideological Rush
Week.

But then, Southeast Asia’s answer
to the Cavalry comes (in the nick of
time), the day is saved—and, in
the end, everybody’s in the village

 

creek taking a community bath, and
the hero is making time— right in
the middle of the creek mind you—
with Indo-China’s answer to Suzie
Wong. Great!

This is realistic drama, of course,
because our villagers have been mo-
tivated by the old devil conscience.
They come to their senses after see-
ing just how cool the American is
in comparison to the Communists—
not a decent apple in the bunch, and
not even family men at that.

This is realistic drama? Well,
maybe not, but we are inclined to
forgive and forget. This is, after all,
the kind of trash we’re used to--
on television, the movies, magazines,
even comic strips. It’s a pleasant note
on which to end the day, so that all
across America, everybody who’s got
an 8:25 can get to sleep—cheerfully,
and quickly.

But what if you’ve got a 10:15? I

 

do. So I stayed up and thought
about this work of art which I had
just seen. And my thoughts led to
this question: How many of us will
end up fighting those Viet Cong
soldiers? A foolish thought—my eye!
What will be the percentage from
the class of ’62 killed in Southeast
Asia? Who will perform better on
the average in the jungles of Loas,
the fraternity man or the non-fra-
ternity man? Sounds like a ques-
tionnaire from the Registrar’s office,
or the Alumni Organization. Very
funny—or just boring fancy. Either
way, the whole thing’s ridiculous.
Is it? I have a brother in the
Navy, on a ship based out of Japan,
patrolling the South China Sea. My
mother wouldn’t laugh at those
random thoughts in the previous
paragraph. If she knew then what
she knows now, she’d have prayed
for my brother to be stationed in

 

Henry Apologizes To Trustees,
Local Cops, McHenry, Readers

By STEVE HENRY

It is this time of year, when the
semester is rushing to a close amidst
great flurries of research and pre-
examination cram sessions, that in-
spires the columnist to make his
peace with all those wonderful in-
dividuals out there in reader-land
whom he has offended during the
past four months.

Such is the theme of our column
today.

Our first apology goes to the Lex-
ington Police Department which was
the target of a column entitled
“Crime and Punishment in Lexing-
ton,” Forgive us, forgive us a thou-
sand times over for creating a
farce about you when the truth
would have sufficed.

Dear Bob...

Apology number two goes out to
Bob McHenry, who was not the most
pleased man in the world with

 

the column entitled “What’s Wrong
with Basketball Here?” If we had
known you were beyond reproach,
we would have never done it,
honest. The success of the Generals
this year has certainly made us see
the folly of our ill-timed words.

Our next apology is directed at
all those people who had something
to do with the Martin Luther King
business. We were entirely out of
place and presumptious to say any-
thing about the matter. After all,
we only go to school here.

Apology number four is for the
alumnus who complained to a mem-
ber of the faculty that we and
Thorns Craven were responsible for
turning the Ring-tum Phi into a
“high school publication.” That’s
certainly a reasonable estimate, sir,
wherever you are. It thrills our
hearts to know W&L’s old grads
think enough about the school to
protect it from things like Thorns
and us that might destroy it.

A New Leaf

Our last apology goes to those
people who accused us of being too
light, flippant, sarcastic, giddy, gay
and disrespectful .This is one that
really hurts us, and we want to dis-
prove it in this column. For those
people who would like to see us
write on something significant, here
we go:

Love, death, sex, marriage, liter-
ature, history, philosophy, sociology,
Freud, Kennedy, war, peace, relig-
ion.

Also time, space, perspective,
meaning, perverseness, politics, wo-
men, music and existentialism.

Not to mention art, Hedonism,
Bergman, Salinger, nuclear devices,
disarmament, bomb shelters, and the
magazine industry.

We could go on and on, but this
is enough deep thinking to keep you
occupied at least through exams.

 

End of apology!

 

Morocco—and that’s no oasis for a
number of reasons. Now she’s very
much concerned.

Well there she is, and there’s
America, the world, us all. The point
being, of course, that who cares if
a few H-bombs fall, as long as they
don’t fall on our families our homes,
this side of the Blue Ridge, or
where we intend to spend spring va-
cation?

Here’s another far - fetched
thought—Fred Astaire was the host.
Now putting Twinkletoes into his-
torical perspective, was he not popu-
lar in the 30’s, not so much in the
public eye in the 40’s, and coming
back strong in the late 50’s and 60’s.
This could be the clue we’ve been
looking for. (The last sentence to be
read in an excited tone.) Fred’s pop-
ular only after a war’s been through
for ten years or so. Hmmmm?

So there he was, at the end of the
show, palming off these classic lines:
“Those Viet Namese have a delight-
ful way to bathe, don’t they?”

Sure Fred, they must be having a
ball. Everybody stops fighting when
it’s time to clean up. That’s why the
bloody war is taking so long.

It’s a rare moment when you real-
ly feel what otherwise you just
know logically to be true. I had a
feeling after that show, though not
because of it, that it is a logical pos-
sibility that there would be another
simple cleaning up job like Korea.

If we feel things like this, then
we will care enough about this
thing to start acting on the feeling
Perhaps this would be a new ingre-
dient to add to the forces fighting

to solve the “problems of the
world”—this ingredient of people
caring.

Now war’s a big problem, and
telling people that the rest of the
world is going to solve its problems
and that we won’t have to get in-
volved, not with Peace Corpsmen,
much less with soldiers—now that’s
the kind of thing that leads to shrug-
ged shoulders, and people not caring.

Therefore, I have a solution—let’s
shoot all the guys who concoct
these grade-Z lullabyes, so that my
brother, me, you and a lot of other
guys won’t get shot in the long run.

There has alawys been a sort of
dichotemy between intellect and rea-
son on the one hand, and emotions
on the other. This same conflict
exists and has existed for a long
time between the scientist and the
artist.

The world of the scientist and
the realm of the artist have, for
seemingly a number of reasons,
split into two separate areas of
pursuit. Society’s attitude appears
to be that a man must be either one
or the other—and most men follow
this line of thought.

tion, the gap between the sciences
and the humanities has been wid-
ened, creating a very real problem
of misunderstanding between the
two.

Chemistry professor Dr. J. K.
Shillington defended the present po-
sition of the scientist against that of
the artist. “The scientist understands
the artist much better than the
artist understands the scientist,” he
said.

“There is not much attempt made
to understand the scientist,” Dr.
Shillington added. “It could be that
the scientist has been forced to learn
about the artist whether he wanted
to or not.”

On the question of which is more
important, he called both areas
“equally acceptable,” but remarked
that “chemistry and science are with
a person from the time of his incep-
tion.”

Dr. Shillington implied that sci-
ence and scientists have been subor-
dinated to the humanities.

“The problem,” he said, “arose
when man decided that the spiritual
was above the material. The material
side of things bothers people The
feeling still prevails that the things
of the spirit are more worthy than
the things of the body.”

Dr. Shillington took issue with this
pushing-out of the physical, and
claimed that “the body is just as
important as the soul.”

The basic problem which comes
out of the separation of the two
fields is that of misunderstanding,
according to Dr. Shillington. “The
scientists finds few people who can
talk science with him.”

“Today it is a problem of mis-
education. While we get the arts and
literature practically from the time
we start school, we don’t really get
into the sciences until high school.”

Asked about the so-called “gen-
eral science” courses for the artist,
Dr. Shillington voiced strong disap-
proval. “The artis insists that we
teach general courses in the history
of science, its basic concepts, etc.
This accomplishes nothing. It only
scratches the surface, and is com-
parable to requiring the scientist to
learn only the ABC’s and stop
there.”

He also doubted if the science
requirement of one year of “general”
nature such as at W&L for majors in
the humanities did any good.

Dr. Shillington suggested, instead,
that four years of a singe science be

Hall Of Fame
Group Praises

Amateur CAC

Washington and Lee pres-
ident Fred C. Cole has receiv-
ed a letter complimenting the
school’s non-subsidized ath-
letic policy from Chester J.
LaRoche, president of the Na-
tional Football Foundation

and Hall of Fame. Mr. La-

Roche’s letter:

Dear President Cole,

The stand taken by your college
in continuing football off the field
with the same sense of amateurism
and decency in which it is played
and officiated on the field is a poli-
cy identical with the National Foot-
ball Foundation.

Congratulations on what you are
trying to do. It is very heartening
to all of us. WE hope that more
and more colleges will recognize
that they should not treat boys like
“hired hands,’ persuading them to
think of an education in terms of
who pays the biggest laundry bill.

The fact is that boys who play
football want to meet their class-
mates on equal terms. If they are
given all sides of the problem, we
find many just want a chance to
earn their way through college.

I think it must be perfectly clear
that we're absolutely against any
de-emphasis in football. What we’re
for is emphasis on its being contin-
ued as a part of an educational
system and kept “amateur” in its
recruitment practices.

Cordially,
Chester J. LaRoche

The National Football Foundation
has as its aim the backing up of
“educators who are trying to keep
football a true amateur sport.” It
tries to maintain the reputation of
the sport by publicity and informa-
tion for the general public and by
the building of a national Football
Hall of Fame at Rutgers University,
where the first intercollegiate foot-
ball game was played in the United
States. The officers of the Founda-
tion include former Army Coach
Earl Blaik. General Douglas Mac-
Arthur is chairman of the National
Advisory Board of the Foundation.

W&L Honored
By Washington

Organization

“It was a great tribute to a grand
bunch of boys.”

That’s how Washington and Lee
head football coach described the
Washington Ttouchdown Club’s an-
nual football awards banquet held
in D.C. last Saturday.

Accepts Trophy

McLaughlin was there to accept
the club’s “Outstanding Small Col-
lege Football Team” trophy for the
Generals, and he was in plenty out-
standing company.

Also receiving awards at the ban-
quet were Green Bay half back
Paul Hornung, New York Yankee
pitcher Whitey Ford, Syracuse full-
back Ernie Davis, and Navy All-
American end Greg Mather.

“It was, of course, very impres-
sive,’ said McLaughlin. “We felt
singularly honored to receive the
award.

The TD club trophy, symbolic
of supremacy in small college foot-
ball, now rests in the showcase in
Doremus Gym.

“We owe it all to the boys,” Mc-
Laughlin said, speaking of the team
that posted a 9-0 record this year.
“They were wonderful.”

Athletic Director Cy Twombly
other members of the General

coaching staff attended the banquet
to watch McLaughlin accept the
trophy from Speaker of the House
Charles McCormick before 1,500
guests who paid $25 a plate for
the privilege.

McLaughlin showed excerpts from
W&L game films to the crowd, and
received “many favorable com-
ments” on the Generals’ perform-
ance,

of W&L’s reach.

Fauber led the Generals with 15
points, and guard Louis Paterno
added 14.

Coach Bob McHenry, admittedly
disappointed after the Bridgewater
loss, said that the Generals couldn’t
get their offense going against an
Eagle defense “geared to disorganize
our plays. We couldn’t ever recov-
er.”

McHenry started freshman Gene
Pearce in the center position, bench-
ing regular center Bill Smith who
has had his problems scoring against
much taller opposition this year.

Pearce, however, came up with a
somewhat less than spectacular per-
formance, and Smith will return to
the starting lineup against William
and Mary Saturday.

Smith is just one of the Generals
suffering from minor injuries after
the Bridgewater game. He has a foot
injury, Paterno has a pulled muscle,
and Fauber has a knee ailment.

 

Grapplers Oppose Norfolk
William and Mary Sat.

Washington and Lee’s_ varsity
wrestlers face Norfolk William and
Mary in Doremus Gymnasium at
7 p.m. Saturday.

The Generals have an impressive
4-1 record, but expect tough oppo-
sition from the Indians.

Coach Dick Miller will go with
Butch West in the 130 ponnd class;
Dave Montgomery, 137-pound; Dick
Albert, 167-pound; Herb Smith, 177-
pound; Jud Babcock, heavyweight
and unlimited.

Norfolk William and Mary always
produces a strong wrestling team,
thanks to the large number of Nor-
folk boys attending the school.

Norfolk is a perennial state high
school wrestling power, and pro-
duces many fine college matmen.

After both teams forfeited in the
initial match, Pete Alford of Phi

pinning Greg Lebedev in the second
period. Junior Walt Erickson made
the score 10-0 by gaining a pin in
the 137 lb. Class.

Frosh Paul McCoy gave PiKA
its first score when he came from
behind to pin his counterpart in the
final period. PiKA Walt Kennedy

successful in football (9-0), cross-
country (7-2), swimming (6-0-1),

Face Ferrum
Here Saturday

Fresh from a 71-62 win over
the Bridgewater JV, Washington
and Lee’s freshman basketball team
returns home tomorrow afternoon
for a game against powerful Ferrum
Junior College.

Ferrum is probably the best team

year. Its record includes a win over
VMI’s freshmen.

Game time is 4:30.

Seventh Win

The victory over Bridgewater
brought the Baby Generals’ season
record to an impressive 7-1.

Jerry Kowalski hit 22, Dick Liv-
ingston had 13, and George Madison
had 11 to pace the winning effort.

Coach Joe Lyles, who called Fer-
rum “one of the best basketball
teams in the state at any level,”
said he’ll start Madison and Liv-
ingston at the forward positions,
Kowalski in the pivot, and Girard
and Varner at the guards.

 

Notice

The Intramural basketball champ-
ionship playoffs will begin imme-

Norfolk W&M Plays Here Tomorrow

Solid Defense ~

) jLast Outing
|| Hands Eagles

Before Exams

Washington and Lee gets one
more chance to pick up its fourth
first semester basketball win when
the Generals meet Norfolk William
and Mary here tomorrow night.
Game time is 8 p.m.

Although sporting an unimpres-
sive season’s record, the Indians
have managed to split in two games
with Little Eight power Hampden-
Sydney and W&L head coach Bob
McHenry calls them “good, tall and
experienced.”

Tom Bettis

Center Tom Bettis ,who played in
high-scoring Leo Anthony’s shadow
last year, has taken over as W&M’s
big gun this year, averaging over
18 points a game. He’s 6’6” and
plenty tough around the boards.

Joining him up front is rebound-
ing specialist Fred Dougan, who got
24 rebounds against Hampden-Syd-
ney.

High Scoring

The Indians build their offense
around a highscoring fast break
triggered by the rebounding of
Bettis and Dougan. They scored 96
points in their last action, a 96-84
win over H-S.

“The only way we can win this
game is with desire, hustle and a
good team effort,” said McHenry.

McHenry will go with his regular
starting five against the Indians.

That will be Tom Supac and
Louie Paterno at the guards, Bip
Fauber and Bill Ide at the for-
wards, and Bill Smith in the pivot.

The Generals are 3-6 for the year.

terest to students—from higher edu-
cation for the American Indian, to
dictatorship in Latin America, to
free expression of ideas.

Of 78 declarations of the last NSA
convention, only 13 were passed by
the assembly of delegates; the re-
maining 65 were passed by the 35-
member Executive Committee after
the convention. This, then, is the
most important fault pointed out
by NSA critics: that an unrepresen-
tative € 20 per cent of American
higher institutions) body should
claim to be “most representative,”
and should pass resolutions unrep-
resentative of its own constituency.

Congress Is Unrepresentative

The NSA boast, that elected dele-
gates of member schools vote on a
platform at the annual Congress, is
mere propaganda. The resolutions
of the Executive Committee carry
as much authority as those of the
Congress. The fact that the EC
is omnipotent ensures that the ac-
tive conservative minority will re-
main powerless and unheard, since
the conservatives cannot be ef-
fective in the _ indirectly-elected
Committee.

NSA resolutions as published in-
clude usually a declaration or man-
date of action. These may be ad-
dressed to all American students,
to NSA officers, to the U.S. Cong-
ress, or to almost any group or
authority.

NSA claims that it “has in the
past reflected the sympathy of the
American student community for
the goals of the Student Non-
Violent Coordinating Committee by
cooperating with that organization,”
and therefore supports it by: recom-
mending that member schools par-
ticipate in picketing and selective
buying campaigns (boycots), and
send letters, wires, and messages of
protest to proper parties.

NSA Debates Are Planned

on Un-American Activities, the NSA member. Uncas McThenia, student

strongly urges the abolition of the
committee, and has directed its
National Affairs Vice-President to
compile an informative resolution
and to send this resolution to all
members of the U.S. Congress.

NSA urges the world’s nuclear
powers to remain at negotiating
tables in an effort to arrive at a
cessation of nuclear testing. It has
denounced Soviet Russia’s resump-
tion of testing, and sent its denun-
ciation to “newspaper, press serv-
ices, and to President Kennedy.”

It has expressed general disap-
proval of the government’s asking
students to take loyalty oaths, and
mandated NSA national officers to
“Use all means permissable to per-
suade the U.S. Congress of the im-
portance of removing the require-
ment of students’ affirming loyalty
before receiving Federal scholarship
funds.

Favors Federal Aid

Claiming that it is necessary that
Federal aid be given to elementary
and secondary schools, NSA asks
for teacher salary and construction
aid to state schools. However, it
would deny aid to schools which
discriminate against any group.

Many national social groups con-
tinue discriminatory practices, says
the NSA; it demands that discrimi-
nation against race, color, religion,
creed, or national orgin be ended
in social organizations.

Through hundreds of such reso-
lutions, the NSA has exerted the
opinion of its members.

Washington and Lee has this year
received “feelers” from the NSA re-

 

body president, and Craig Distle-
horst, junior, plan a debate on the
NSA and its policies at Sweet Briar
and Randolph-Macon February 13.
They will meet representatives of
the Virginia-Carolinas Region NSA.
The debate has been planned for
some weeks, and has been canceled
and re-scheduled twice previously.

taken. He haid that this was
a better alternative than merely
skimming the surface of a science.

Concluding, he pointed out that
the problem of subordination will
continue to exist—despite educa-
tion—as long as we rate the material
of lesser importance than the spiri-
tual.

Again he reiterated the importance
of having both. “We must have
both—every man individually must,
if he is to be decently educated.”

Fishwick also stated that until he
knew more specifically to what Per-
cy was referring, he could only
make this statement in support of

 

garding this school becoming a! Lee.

The Foundation, which points out
that they do not want to de-empha-

the New York Times described the
by-laws of the conference as follows:

“The new conference’s articles of
organization state forthrightly the
principles to which the NS.A.A.
theoretically subscribes but must
talk around to keep peace in the
ranks...

“Without fudging, (these provi-
sions) get right to the heart of
what constitutes ‘proper conduct of
intercollegiate sports’ as defined
even by those who stray from the
line in practice...

“The articles make other telling
points...

“If enough other institutions adopt
and live up to these principles, the
N.C.A.A. in future years will not
have to waste so much time on such
gnat-slapping proposals as barring
outside competition in basketball.”

By STEVE GUILD
Executive News Editor

Washington and Lee frater-
nities began their formal Help
Week activities yesterday
morning as the final part of
their pledge training programs

for the year.

In contrast with years past, the
week’s work is supposed to center
‘ mainly around community service
and house improvement projects as
a result of the new Help Week pro-
posals passed by the Interfraternity
Council three weeks ago.

Sunday Meeting

IFC president Bob Doenges met
with all fraternity house presidents
and pledgemasters on Sunday eve-
ing to discuss in detail the new pro-
posals and how they would be en-
forced, and then the group reviewed
the general rules that have been
used in former years.

The new proposals provide that
“no individual should be forced
to perform deeds that violate his
basic sense of human dignity and
decency.”

In addition, a revolving trophy
will be awarded to the pledge class
“achieving the most constructive
service for their fraternity, and
community, and University.”

To Visit Houses

Doenges and Steve Rutledge, Phi
Gam senior, who has headed a
committee for the study of Help
Week program proposals, will make
frequent visits at each of the 18
fraternity houses on campus during
the week to inspect the Help Week
activities.

The new interest in community
service is reflected by the variety
of projects planned by several fra-
ternities.

Some of these projects include
aiding the staff of McCormick
Library, painting Dr. Fishwick’s
house, assisting in the local March
of Dimes campaign, and helping
a semi-invalid resident of Rock-
bridge County.

In addition to this, many of the
fraternities will be repainting and, in
general, cleaning up the interior and
exterior of the houses.

 

28 Students Withdraw
Under Automatic Rule

The Committee on the Automatic
Rule has announced the withdrawal
of 28 students from the University
because of academic failure.

Included in this total
freshmen, 16 sophomores
juniors and seniors.

Last year, a total of 34 students
withdrew after the first semester.
Of this number 22 were freshmen
and 12 were upperclassmen.

The committee is composed of the
President of the University, the
deans of the Arts and Sciences
School, the Commerce School, the
Law School, as well as the Dean of

Most of the fraternities will also
have some of the former projects for
their pledges. A few houses require
gunny-sack underwear, others have
certain definitions and _ sayings
pledges must repeat, and, of course,
there will be the traditional KA log.

The official end of Help Week is
10:00 Friday night, and most of
the fraternities will initiate their
pledges sometime during the week-
end.

ter was Douglas W. Bell, a transfer
from Dartmouth.

New freshmen are Marshall Dan-
iels, a freshman here last fall; Wil-
liam French Skinner, Jr., a second
semester transfer from VPI; Julius

value of a ticket to a job even as a
door-to-door salesman,” he said.

Speaking of the Washington
and Lee campus, he said that “the
students differed from students at
other colleges by wearing col-
lars and ties. They dressed formal-
ly, like gentlemen.”

“Tn a class of 23 students,” he said,
“IT learned that not one of them had
ever seen a stage play beyond what
they put on at their own little
theater.”

In a closing statement, O’Faolain
said the following about American
education:

“The cardinal virtue in America
is “thou shalt work” and that is
wrong. They work too hard and too
long and miss the pleasure that
knowledge can give.”

MacDonald
To Talk Here
On Far East

John E. MacDonald, the State De-
partment’s chief of research for
Southeast Asia, will speak to stu-
dents at Washington and Lee Fri-
day (Feb. 9) concerning recent de-
velopments in Viet Nam and other
Southeast Asian countries.

MacDonald’s remarks are sched-
uled for 11:10 a.m. in Newcomb Hall.
Although two University political
science classes will hear the Far East
specialist as a part of their regular
study program, MacDonald’s talk
will be open to the general public.

MacDonald, who is on a short lec-
ture visit of area colleges, will talk
to students at Virginia Military In-
stitute Friday afternoon at 2 p.m.

He is a native of New Hampshire,
graduated from Yale in 1935, and
joined the Department of State in
1945. Chief of research for Southeast
Asia since July, 1961, MacDonald
is expert in his knowledge of the
Chinese language and he has held
various other positions in the de-
partment and with Foreign Service

Number 29

Professor Mahomed Krader Nawaz, Visiting Associate
Professor in the Woodrow Wilson School of Foreign Affairs
at the University of Virginia will speak at W&L’s International
Relations Week on Thursday, the 15th of February, at 7:30
p.m. in Lee Chapel. Mr. Nawaz will join Senator Albert Gore,
of Tennesse, whose address will open the program on the

13th of February.

The title of Professor Nadaz’s*

lecture will be, “The United Nations
at Crossroads.” He has stated he
will emphasize the attitudes Amer-
ican citizens should take toward
the United Nations in its struggle for
success in maintaining world peace,
attitudes which will be consistent
with his view that “The United
Nations without strong support
from the United States would be
like a production of Hamlet without
the Prince of Denmark.”

Professor Nawaz took his bacca-
laureate degree at Andhra Univer-
sity, in India, and he took both
bachelor’s and masters degrees in
law in Madras University, gaining
first rank in both examinations. He
practiced the profession of law in
Madras, and he has served as sec-
retary to a member of the Indian
Parliament. He is currently on leave
from a Research Fellowship in In-
ternational law at the Indian School
of International Studies.

Mr. Nawaz has published numer-
ous studies on international law and
international organization in the
Indian Journal, International Studies
and in the Indian Yearbook of Inter-
national Affairs.

International Relations Week was
first begun in 1953-54 under the
direction of Dr. Harvey Wheeler,
professor of political science, now
on leave to the Center for the Study
of Democratic Institutions.

The week is intended to stimulate
interest in international affairs
among the student body through
the presentation of excellent speak-
ers in the field.

In the past years the week has
featured such figures as Arnold
J. Toynbee; Norman Thomas; Paul
Hoffman, Director of the United
Nations’ Special Fund; and Arthur
Larson, Director of the World
Rule of Law Center at Duke Uni-
versity.

Albert Gore,

Senator Democrat

from Tennessee, will be the prin-
cipal speaker this year.

He will speak at the opening ses-
sion of the two-day series of talks
in Lee Chapel on Tuesday evening,
February 13 at 7:30,

W&L’s Dean F. J. Gilliam:
A Guardian Of Heritage

Editor’s Note: The following editorial was written by
Nathan P. B. Simpson, editor of the Friday Ring-tum Phi
last year, at the request of the Tuesday Edition. The feelings
expressed in his editorial, are, we feel, of significance at this
time,

On February first, a beloved servant of Washington and
Lee took leave of the office and title of Dean of Students.

Each of us who has enjoyed association with the University
during Frank J. Gilliam’s administration as dean will remember
this man in so far as we have felt the healthy influence he has
exerted upon our lives.

Perhaps we will remember him as the persuasive salesman
tirelessly canvassing our prep or high school and telling us of
the merits of a Washington and Lee education.
On the other hand, we may remember him as
an impartial, frank and forceful counselor,
whose guidance was informed by an under-
standing of the merits of the alternative po-
sitions in our conflict. Or we might remember

   

wet >
ies im —
Gilliam

He was there at

all he could for

him as a stern, yet somehow compassionate
disciplinarian, sympathetic and always willing
to give a student another chance.

We may recall him as the energetic and
aggressive worker behind the scenes in student
affairs whose aid and time we desperately
solicited and he generously gave. It might
have been the time we were sick or injured
and in a hospital in Lexington, Roanoke, or
Richmond when we best remember this man.
any hour comforting our parents and doing
us. We might just remember him as a person

stately in bearing who could always call our names as we passed
him on the colonnade.

Whatever our impressions and memories of this man, we
all know that his care and concern reached out to all of us.
Our problems sooner or later became his problems, and our
sorrows or joys were his also. His life of dedication has been an
inspiration for countless Washington and Lee students and as
his tasks at the university lessen, W&L will feel its loss.

We as students and alumni can watch with pride

Washing-

ton and Lee’s promise become a reality of progress and achieve-
ment, but in my opinion our institution’s greatest asset is not

its superstructure of new accomplishments, but its foundation
of tradition and dedication. A person who has stood firm on this

foundation as a

guardian of Washington and Lee’s heritage

and whose life has been dedicated to the ideals of this institu-

tion is Dean Frank J. Gilliam.

Many of the memories which are born of four years of
undergraduate work at Washington and Lee are destined to be
erased by an erosion of time or replaced by new experiences,
but there will always be a few indelible impressions which will
not leave us. The life of this man and his association with each

of us 1S such an impression.

King’s Rejection
Tops News Stories
\f First Semester

By BOB HOLLAND
Staff Writer

Dissention over the rejection of a proposed appear-
ance by a controversial Negro spokesman, an unde-
feated football season, and a whipped college bowl
quiz team were the highlights of what has been an
unusually news-worthy semester at Washington and
Lee University this year.

The announcement of the formation of a new ath-
letic conference that will include W&L, a shift in the
top University administration, the newly-organized
student control discipline committee, and another
state championship for W&L’s fine debate team also
would have to be ranked close to the top of any list
of leading news stories emanating from this college.

In this reporter’s opinion, however, the Martin
Luther King controversy lead the way by a wide
margin in campus happenings. The initial announce-
ment by the university Board of Trustees that Rev.
King would not be allowed to speak at a seminar
here on Christian ethics ignited a spark of dissent
that found both the students and faculty lodging
protests against what they considered an infringe-
ment of academic freedom.

Perhaps (again, in the opinion of this reporter)
rejection of the request that Rev. King speak at
the university may have salutary results in the
long run. The decision was not calmly accepted
on the campus as is the case in all too many in-
stances at this university. The realization that
freedom to hear divergent opinion was being
threatened stimulated a spontaneous protest that
may give more meaning to the theory of academic
freedom at this university in years to come.

In the field of W&L sports there was strictly “no
contest” in consideration of the leading news story.
The undefeated football team of coach Lee M. Mc-
Laughlin wins hands down.

The non-subsidized, or as daily newspapers are
accustomed to say, the “simon-pure” team of the
university once again proved that good football
can be played without paying money for hired hands.
Thus, the victories on the playing field can justly

Res Ipsa Loquitur

 

be translated into another kind of victory for the
Washington and Lee administration and coaching
staff—a “moral” victory.

While the Washington and Lee athletic teams were
racking up victory after victory, a team of univer-
sity scholars found the going a bit rough on a na-
tion-wide quiz program. Facing opponents that had
won four contests in a row on the College Quiz Bowl,
the university team of Bill Lowry, Tom Lybass, Jim
Campbell, and Rick Anderson were eliminated in
their first try.

Another encouraging aspect of the first semester
was faculty approval of the Student Control
Committee. The duty of this new group will be to
investigate and take appropriate action on con-
duct offenses reported te it by the university
proctor, the administration of neighboring insti-
tutions, or the Executive Committee of the Stu-
dent body.

The committee represents a heartening advance
toward the ideal of considerable self-government by
the Washington and Lee student body.

A recent news story of merit concerned the top-
level change in the university administration. Dr.
Edward C. Atwood, Jr., a former associate profes-
sor of economics at Washington and Lee, will return
to the university as Dean of Students. He will assume
some of the duties of Dean Frank J. Gilliam. Gilliam,
Dean of Students since 1931, who will continue to
serve as Dean of Admissions.

Not to be overlooked is a news story that broke on
the same day as the administrative shake-up. The
Interfraternity Council has adopted a first draft of a
new proposal that would provide for changes in the
traditional “Help Week” for pledges of the 18 fra-
ternities here.

It remains to be seen whether or not the student
body will lend its support to the IFC proposals, but
the plan has merit. The time has come for action to
prevent the numerous abuses of the week of “Hell”
pledges must endure before becoming fraternity
members. Certainly there should be some sort of ac-

America-W &L Need Radical Middle

By THORN CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

Since everything that happened
in the last three weeks is mov-
ing pretty quickly into a slightly
_ foggy Spiritus
* mundi, and you
know how you
feel just as well
as I do, I think
it’s best to dis-
ms pense with
exams and Fan-
cy Dress in the
first paragraph
today, and then
move on to a
new. series’ of
impression and
lively treatments of topics of gen-
eral interest.

One such topic which struck me
as being almost completely ig-
nored is the one I've picked for
today.

In the past few months Wash-
ington and Lee has_ witnessed
something of a revival of active
political action involving nation-
al issues. I’m thinking in partie-
ular of the founding and continu-
ation of the Young Republican
Club and the Conservative Socie-
ty, and the beginning of weekly
political discussions held at the
Liquid under the auspices of the
Mongolian Minks.

In all these activities I have
begun to notice a particular void
which seems to cry for filling, not
only here at W&L, but all over
the country. We have the radical
left in some places, and the radi-
cal right seems to be everywhere.

What is missing is a pressure
group for those of us who reached
the age of discretion when nothing

Craven

exciting was happening in the
ideological battle. What I mean is
that America in general and

Washington and Lee in particular
needs the organization of a radi-
cal middle.

Made up of all othose people
who are consciously uninterested,
it ean carry on all sorts of cam-
paigns which are yet to be uncov-
ered.

In the interest of being of some
help to the future founders and
initiators of such a radical middle
group, and there are plenty of you

who could step right in on the
vanguard of this new wave, I'd
like to present some very sketchy
ideas for one such important cam-
paign which would necessarily be
among the first to be launched.

First of all an
committee could be set up to
check upon all people who are
interested in something import-
ant, with an eye toward prevent-
ing these people from increasing

Too Much Opinion Puts
Bias Into Some Courses

investigating their ranks. This could be done
very easily by making public an
account of what happens to in..o-
cent people who are caught up in
movements in either direction.

By pointing out how any move-
ment is bound inherently to cor-
rupt the movers the radical mid-
dle can bring the school, the na-
tion, and eventually the world in
from positions of antipathy which
have always been known because
of a radical middle.

In case the threat was too in-

By BRENT ARTHUR
Tuesday Writer

Students attend college for many
and varied reasons.

They come expecting an educa-
tion in any case. The Washington
and Lee campus is a good bit out of
the ordinary. Our Student Body
represents a highly selective group
of individuals. Yet how many of us
realize the difference between in-
doctrination and education?

Most of us will swear by a news-
paper article, which is but one man’s
opinion. His subject matter may have
been discussed from a biased opin-
ion, or be but one side of the story.
Herein lies the simple process of in-
doctrination.

Indoctrination is the process
wherein we are led to believe that
there is only one correct position on
a question whether the subject mat-
ter involved be in the field of sci-
ence, history, politics, religion, etc.

 

dangerous one. It is not compatible |
with the “ideal of a university,”
| I feel that this process appears quite
frequently in the W&L class room.
| However, the responsibility for
' dealing with this problem lies not
only with the professor, but with the
| student.
| Many times the “correct view-
| point” is but an opinion, which may
| or may not be shared by many oth-
| ers. What cannot be established as
| fact relies upon opinion (i.e., theory,
| ideas, beliefs, etc.) which is repre-
sented by varied points of view.
Sometimes we are subjected to
| but one perspective. Too many of us

| tend to accept this position without |

| first analyzing it. In many cases we
| do not know all that may be in-
| volved, but are willing to accept a
| theory because it was presented by a

 

but |

 

brilliant man in a particular field.
But there is always more than one
authority or scholar in a given field,
and their views are often diametri-
cally opposed to one another.

There is a vast difference between
indoctrination and education. The
true educational process consists of
presenting and exploring a subject
from all points of view. All theo-
ries and ideologies have their pros
and cons, opponents and supporters.
Education is achieved only when
one knows and understands the dif-
ferent aspects of a theory. It is up to
the student to study the merits of
each viewpoint and to draw his own
conclusions from the facts presented
him.

To teach but one side of the sub-
ject matter is not to educate, but to
indoctrinate. The educational pro-
cess is designed to make the student
think, and not just accept another’s
opinion, even though it be the pro-

This process of indoctrination is a | fessor’ s. One student had a paper

returned with “poor source” marked
beside several books in his biblio-
graphy. When checked out, these
sources represented several leading
scholars in the field who held oppos-
ing but highly respected positions.
These “poor sources” not only are
held in high esteem, but have dis-
tinguished records. This is not to
deny that there are books which
may well be poor sources but to cite
an example.

The Washington and Lee Faculty
offers its students an excellent edu-
cation. Yet, there are professors who
insist upon stressing their personal
opinion to such an extent that we
too adopt their bias without ever be-
ing exposed to other viewpoints.
This practice offers only an indoc-
trination, if we fail to explore what
some professors choose to neglect.

 

volved, what I mean is that a
radical middle can bring the world
to a complete standstill by causing
a head-on collision of left and
right. With everyone in the mid-
dle there would be no war, no
fall-out, and nobody left on base.
This idea is becoming so in-
triguing to me the more I think
about it, that I believe I might
have to do something on my own.
As I consider the radical middle
while it seems to be of such scope
that I might have to go into ac-
tion to really get it begun as an
active force on the world scene.
I'm going to have to develop this
further in the next issue.
Meanwhile all of you can be-
gin to formulate your own radical
middle plans.
We can upset the country on
both sides, fold it like a checker
board, then rule.

Undefeated WEL Mermen
To Face Tough Maryland

By AL JOHNSTON

The strength of Washington and
Lee’s undefeated mermen will be
put to one of its toughest tests
when the swimmers meet Maryland
in College Park February 12th.

 

Spring Practice
For Footballers
Starting Monday

Lincoln’s birthday will find the
varsity football aspirants starting
on their two weeks of “Spring”
practice. From Monday the 12th
continuing through Saturday the
24th the footballers will be getting
into shape, reviewing fundamentals,
and running plays preparing the
ground for the new campaign in the
Fall.

Freshmen Out

The coaches will be taking a close
look at the freshmen who are out,
trying to fit them into the blue, red
or gold teams. Coach Dana Swan
estimates that around twenty boys
from last fall’s frosh team will draw
equipment and try out.

Coach Swan feels Skip Chase,
Ash Allen, Chuck Long, Dan Ma-
son, Greg Sharkey, Bill Julian and
Al Hubbard will be some of the
promising frosh who could break
into the ranks of the varsity.

Coach Buck Leslie has _ been
working with the freshmen and
sophomore gridders three afternoons
a week on a voluntary basis. They
have been running, swimming, and
playing basketball since football
season to stay in shape.

 

Globetrotters At VMI;
Team Here March 16

For those who like basketball and
a little clowning March 16th is a
date to remember. The world fa-
mous Harlem Globetrotters will ap-
at the VMI field house that evening.

Meadowlark Lemon with his zany

antics, and the whole team will come
to Lexington.

During the past season the Mary-
land Terps have displayed their
ability by beating such teams as
Pittsburgh and North Carolina.

Two brothers, Hugh and Ted Lu-
pien, will cause the Generals some
troubles. Hugh swims the butterfly
and Ted competes in the breast
stroke and freestyle events. These
two have helped Maryland achieve
such a fine record this season.

The Terps are characterized by a
lot of depth, having more than one
good man in each event to get
them those extra points.

In addition to the Lupien brothers
Maryland has Schaeberle in the
breastroke who in last year’s meet
came close to upsetting W&L’s rec-
ord-breaking Captain, Elliot May-
nard.

Coach Norris Eastman stated that
his boys will have a little over a
week to practice and that they will
be in the best shape possible by
Monday.

 

 

Frosh Sports

Teams Active

This week in sports at Washington
and Lee will see the freshman
swimmers meet Lynchburg here at
4:30 in the afternoon.

This Saturday the JV Wrest-
ling team takes on the Duke frosh
in Durham as a prelim to the
W&L-Duke Varsity meet.

Coach Joe Lyles’ highly success-
ful freshman basketball squad plays
SMA February 15 for their next
game.

Washington and Lee’s basketball

despite the fact the the Generals

The main reason that Washington

named Bill Hardin. Hardin, the
state’s leading scorer, poured in
32 points as he paced the Tiger at-
tack.

We'll have to stop Hardin Sat-

| adding a special one for the Hamp-, of defense we played against Nor-

| folk William and Mary in our last
' game,” the coach said.

| “Norfolk came into the game with
a 7-2 record and we put the pressure
| on them. Consequently they hit only
| 15 per cent from the floor the first
half. They weren’t off either. Our
defense stopped them. In the second
half they hit 40 per cent but that
was because our boys got tired.”

W&L, which built up a 32-18
halftime lead, defeated the Mon-
archs, 71-58.

Defense has been the key to
W&L’s limited success so far this
season; and surprisingly enough
the key to the W&L defense has
been freshman guard Louis Pa-
atrno.

 

Paterno along with captain Rodger
Fauber and guard Tom Supak carry
the brunt of the W&L offensive at-
tack. All three are averaging over
1l points per game.

But, as McHenry says, “if our de-
fense can stop the opponents, our
offense will be all right, and our de-
fense is looking stronger every
game.”

meeting in December and plans its
first formal meeting for early this
month. It is open to any students
who have a genuine interest in the
Civil War.

The probable meeting format will
be a roundtable discussion on a
pre-announced topic, with various
members taking part. Guest speak-
ers will also be presented.

Debate Team
At Hopkins

Bill Noell took third place in the
extemporaneons speaking contest at
the 12th annual Johns Hopkins De-
bate Tournament held February 2-3.

Mr. William Chaffin, debate team
coach, said that the W&L team pro-
duced “the best results in years” in
the Hopkins debate.

The W&L team defeated King’s
College, which took second place in
the nation last year, having lost only
to Harvard.

Noell and Al Eckes debated both
sides, three negative and three af-
firmative issues.

Freshman Steve Smith also went
on the trip, but only entered one
event.

Coming up this

Senator Albert Gore
Announces IRW Topic

Senator Albert Gore, who will be the principle speaker for Washington
and Lee’s International Relations Week, announced the topic for his

Tuesday evening speech from his Washington office Thursday. He will
draw attention to the “United States Foreign Policy in the Congo”—a sub-
ject of vital concern in today’s struggle for power in the world.

As chairman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs in the Senate |_

Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Gore is considered one of the most
important men in the country in this field.

Senator Gore’s arrival Tuesday will be marked by a large state-wide
press conference here. Later, a dinner will be held in his honor at Evans
Dining Hall at 5:45 p.m. Faculty members of the Political Science Depart-
ment have been invited as well as members of the host International
Relations Club, Pi Sigma Alpha, and selected students. The dinner is
$2.50 per plate and will feature a short after-dinner talk by the Senator
to the guests. The principal speech is scheduled at Lee Chapel at 7:30 p.m.

 

Federal Research Expert

Discusses Southeast Asia

By LARRY MEEKS

“Southeast Asia has something
for everyone in the academic field,’
John E. MacDonald told a Washing-
ton and Lee audience this morning.
For the historian there is a rich and
varied history of the rise and fall
of dynasties, and an equally fertile
field for economists, political sci-
entists, and students of geo-politics.

MacDonald, a native of New
Hampshire, is the State Depart-
ment’s Chief of Research for South-
east Asia. A graduate of Yale, he has
been with the State Department
since 1945. He received his current
appointment last July. He has
worked in China, Japan and Korea.

He serves as an advisor to Sec-
retary of State Dean Rusk and
other state department officials. He
also spends time in interdepartmen-
tal affairs such as preparing papers

Debaters Plan
TV Appearance

By STEVE SMITH

Washington and Lee’s debating
team, which is at King’s College
this weekend for its second major
tournament in two weeks, will ap-
pear on television March 12.

The team will face the winner of
a Duke-North Carolina match on
WUNC, debating the topic “Re-
solved: That the United States
should withdraw from the United
Nations.” The program will run
from 9 to 10 o’clock p.m.

The appearance will take place on
a regular debating program which
is watched by several millions of
people.

Team In Roanoke Feb. 19

In another demonstration debate
a week later, the team will appear
before a Roanoke high school. The
school was invited by the high
school to put on a model debate on
Feb. 19.

This weekend the team is at
King’s College, Wilkes-Barre, Penn-

 

sylvania, facing such _ perennial
powers as Dartmouth, Duquesne,
Fordham, Penn State, Pittsburgh,

Villanova, and Ohio. The negative
team is composed of Bill Noell and
Al Eckes, while Jay Clark and Ed
Norton are debating the affirmative
resolution.

The King’s Tournament is a
strength-against-strength match,
meaning that the winning teams
face winning teams in the late
rounds, while losing teams come up
against losing teams.

Noell and Eckes Shine

In the Johns Hopkins Tournament
last weekend, Noell and Eckes
earned a 3-3 record in a strength-
against-strength arrangement. After
trouncing powerful Kings College in
the first round the duo had to face
strong teams for the remainder of
the tournament.

Normally negative debaters, they
won every round in which they
drew the negative side, while losing
their 3 affirmative matches. They
finished 16th in a field of over 40
which included many of the top
debaters in the nation.

Noell also won third place in the
extemporaneous speaking contest,
failing to bring home a second place
award by a narrow margin. He
spoke on the “Success of the Peace
Corps To Date” with 10 minutes
preparation.

Freshman Steve Smith also en-
tered the extemporaneous category
but failed to place.

 

on “the prospects for country X for
the next three years.”

In the beginning of his discussion
he emphasized the importance of
Southeast Asia, with an area 1,600,-
000 square miles and a population of
200,000,000.

Southeast Asia, said MacDonald,
provides a boundary between the
Hindu Culture and the Chinese Cul-
ture.

He discussed “the transition from
colonial states that has oecurred in
the last 16 years.” This transition
was preceded by three factors, “na-

tionalism, anti-colonialism, and the |}

feeling for independence.”

Another major factor is the local
pride in the historical and cultural
aspects. Each country looks for
something to make it unique.

Educated People Pro-Socialist

The influence of Marxist thought
has been important. The educated
class as a whole are pro-socialist
but not pro-communist, MacDonald
said.

The U.S. influence, which has
grown as colonialism disappeared,
must also be considered.

In his summary he brought out
the influence of the Malayan insur-
rection. This success provides a
precedent for the other nations in
the fight against Communism. It
set the precedent for Viet Nam’s
fight against Communism.

The U.S. Problems

He concluded that a great change
has been coming about in Southeast
Asia since World War II. The Unit-
ed States wants to maintain the peo-
ple’s newly gained independence—
but there are problems. One of these
is that the United States is dealing
with agricultural people, many of
whom wish to continue as they have
been through the centuries. They
must be reconciled to change and
realize that these changes are for
their benefit.

Math Programs
To Be Studied

The chairman of the committee
on undergraduate mathematics pro-
grams of the Mathematical Asso-
ciation of America will speak Feb.
19 and 20 at Washington and Lee.

Dr. R. Creighton Buck, a mem-
ber of the University of Wiscon-
sin faculty, will discuss the appli-
cation of mathematics and mathe-
matical research before advanced
classes here. He also will speak at
a public session at 8 p.m. Feb. 19 in
the university’s duPont Auditorium.

His topic will be “Research in
Mathematics.”
Professor Buck’s work with the

national association is involved with
the improvement of college mathe-
matical curricula. His research in-
terests are function theory and
algebraic analysis. He is the author
of several books and over 40 re-
search papers.

A 1941 graduate of the University
of Cincinnati, Dr. Buck was a Jun-
ior Fellow in the Harvard Society
of Fellows. He received his Ph.D.
degree from Harvard in 1947. He has
served as a member of the Brown
University faculty.

As a Guggenheim Fellow, he was
guest professor at Stanford Univer-
sity in 1958-59 and the following
year he was a staff member of the
Communications Research Division
of the Institute for Defense Analy-
ses in Princeton.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, FEBRUARY 9, 1962

 

Mr. Coleman and Dr. Moger with new Lee Letters.

 

Two Lee Letters, Worth $4500,
Are Willed To The University

Two of General Robert E. Lee’s
letters to President Jefferson, vauled
at $4,500, have been added to
Washington and Lee’s collection of
more than 5,000 Lee letters.

The letters, bound in a red mo-
rocco leather case, are dated August
22, 1863, and February 9, 1965, and
were willed to the university by
the late Alfred W. Stern, a Chi-
cago clothing executive.

The correspondence presents an
interesting contrast in the career
of the famous Confederate general
who later became president of
Washington College here. The Au-
gust letter--written at Lee’s head-
quarters at Orange Courthouse—in-
dicates that General Lee regrets that
President Davis will not consider
Lee’s request to be relieved of his
post and permit him to serve “in
any capacity at any post where I
can do good.

General Lee thought that “the
lower the position, the more suit-
able” to his ability and the more
“agreeable” to his feelings.

The 1865 letter, composed at Lee’s
Petersburg headquarters, is Gener-
al Lee’s acceptance of the post of
General-in-Chief (commanding gen-
eral) of the Confederate Army. He
had been commander of the Army of
Northern Virginia until his appoint-
ment in the last two months of the
war.

The letters are valued at more
than $4,500, according to Earl S.
Mattingly, Washington and Lee
treasurer.

Stern, a retired officer of Kup-
penhiem & Co, Ince. in Chicago,
died May 3, 1960. In his will, he
requested that the letters be given
to Washington and Lee. Neighbor-
ing Virginia Military Institute re-
ceived an original letter by Gen-
eral Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson
through Stern’s will. More than
5,000 books, letters and pamphlets
concerning Abraham Lincoln were
willed by Stern to the Library of
Congress along with a $25,000 trust
fund for the library’s use.

Generals Lee’s letters will be
placed with some 5,000 other Lee

 

Hollins Literary Festival

Hollins College’s annual Liter-
ary Festival begins on February 17,
featuring Randall Jarrell, William
Golding, John Aldridge, and Rob-
ert Hazel.

Jarrell and Hazel will read from
their poetry.

Aldridge will present a lecture
on “the Irrelevance of Outrage in
Recent Southern Fiction.” Golding’s
lecture is entitled “An Innocent

 

Abroad.”

 

items, according to Dr. Allen W.
Moger, Washington and Lee profes-
sor of history and Lee archivist.
The complete collection of Lee ma-
terial is open to scholars for in-
spection and research.

Several additional Lee letters also
have been added to the university’s
archives. Mrs. Armistead L. Long,
a Lynchburg resident, donated let-
ters by General Lee and one by
Mrs. Lee. One of the documents,
written to General Armistead R.
Long shortly after the surrender at
Appomattox, tells of Lee’s desire
to find “some little quiet house in
the woods” to get his wife away
from the city. The letter from Mrs.
Lee is addressed to Miss Virginia
Long, General Long’s daughter.

The donor is the widow of the
nephew of General Long to whom
General Lee wrote.

“We at Washington and Lee feel
that these letters are a_ significant
contribution to our Lee Archives,”
Dr. Moger said. “They enhance our
already extensive collection, and I
am certain they will prove to be of
value to many Lee scholars who
visit our library.”

 

Marine Corps Officer
Will Interview for PLC

Marine Corps officer selection of-
ficer will be on campus February 12
and 13 to interview students for
Marine Corps officer training pro-
grams. The Officer selected team
will be at W&L to provide informa-
tion and interview applicants.

Freshmen and sophomore men
attend a 6-week increments of Pla-
toon Leaders Class training at Quan-
tico, Virginia during their summer
vacations. Juniors attend a 12-week
summer training session the sum-
mer prior to Graduation.

Applicants are commissioned sec-
ond lieutenants immediately upon
graduation. Seniors and graduates
attend a 10-Week officer candidate
course after graduation and are
then commissioned.

For qualified applicants, Platoon
Leaders Class (aviation) and avia-
tion officer candidates courses are
available.

There are no training commit-
ments during the school year.

Members of the PLC are not re-
quired to complete any special col-

lege courses, but are required to
maintain an overall “C” average,
successfully complete the summer

training, and earn a_ baccalaureate
degree before being commissioned.

All time spent in the program is
counted for pay purposes upon as-
signment to active duty.

The elimination of Hell
and Lee fraternities and the
community service mark the
closes tonight.

 

New Major:
Contemporary
Civilization

A new history major, in
Contemporary _—__ Civilization,

and an advanced placement
program for freshmen will be
added to the Washington and
Lee curriculum next year,
Dean of the College William
W. Pusey announced today.

The new Contemporary Civilizza-
tion program makes a third possible
history major, in addition to the two
now offered in American and Eur-
opean history. According to Profes-
sor William G. Bean, chairman of
the history department, the new
major is designed to allow students
who have no professional interest in
history to study more in areas that
are specifically related to the prob-
lems and developments of contem-
porary events.

In an additional move to make the
curriculum more “flexible,” the his-
tory major has been reduced from
36 to 30 hours beyond History 1 and
Z

Beginning next fall, freshmen may
apply for exemption from History 1
and 2. All freshmen entering with
a verbal score of 600 or more on
their Scholastic Aptitude Test will
automatically be eligible to take a
test in European civilization and pre-
sent an essay to qualify for ad-
vanced standing. If the history de-
partment exempts them from the
freshman course, they will take six
hours in advanced history courses
instead.

Shenandoah

Features
Poet Graves

The winter issue of Shenandoah,
edited by English Instructor Doug-
las Day, will appear on the news-
stands in the next few days.

The issue features a symposium
on English poet Robert Graves, com-
prised of essays by W. H. Auden,
Thom Gunn, G. S. Fraser, D. J. En-
right, Donald Davie, Alan Sillitoe,
and Colin Wilson.

Poems by Enright, Davie, and
Sillitoe; and by Philip Larkin, Geof-
frey Hill, Ruth Fainlight, and Geof-
frey Johnson are published.

 

Book reviews by Mr. James Boat-
wright and Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy,
of the W&L English department, are
featured. Mr. Boatwright reviews
Malcolm Lowry’s Hear Us O Lord
From Heaven Thy Dwelling Place
and Dr. Flournoy reviews George
Steiner’s The Death of Tragedy.

In introductory note to the issue,
Mr. Day says of Graves: “Except
for a few pioneer essays and a
couple of brief pamphlets about him,
Robert Graves has for many years
gone without the recognition due
him as one of England’s greatest (an
adjective which Graves despises)
living poets. The issue of Shenan-
doah represents at attempt to pro-
vide his rapidly growing audience
with a number of articles, by lead-
ing critics and poets, which should
do something to establish him in the
high position he has merited for so
long. We have done this not for his
sake—he has always been rather
contemputous of his critics, and has
consistently derided any such at-
tempts to “place” him—but for our
own sakes. He may not need the
friendship of the critics, but we
need to know him far better than
we do. With all apologies to Robert
Graves, then, we herewith offer this
symposium to all who might wish
to know something more about Eng-
land’s leading poet.”

Three Fraternities
Abolish Hell Week

By MALCOLM MORRIS

Week by three Washington
success of a new emphasis on

end of “Help Week” as it

* PiKA Hell Week Through

PiKA ended all pledge abuses
Wednesday night, substituting a
program of constructive activities.

Pledge Trainer Bill Outman com-
mented on the change: “PiKA Hell
Week is over for good as far as the
traditional concepts of Washingtor
and Lee’s Hell Week go. Our reason
for a change lies in a combination
of elements, found not only in our
house but in the whole student
body. We still will continue a week
of intensified pledge activity but
only along a purely constructive
line.”

Phi Gams

Phi Gamma Delta has announced
that this will be the last year of tra-
ditional Hell Week for its pledges.
President Steve Rutledge noted:

The fraternity is moving in the
direction of eliminating the tradi-
tional Hell Week at Washington
and Lee. It is hoped that next year’s
program will eliminate all traces of
the former abuse to pledges.

Rutledge said that although plans
for next year were not yet definite, a
committee of the chapter had al-
ready begun work on a more effec-
tive pledge training period. The
abolition of Hell Week by the Phi
Gams is in accordance with the urg-
ing of the national fraternity toward
a more progressive program.

Sigma Chi

Sigma Chi abolished Hell Week in
time to become the only house on
campus not to stage the period this
year. President Bob Doenges, also
President of the IFC, said that only
constructive work has been done by
pledges during this Help Week.

Emphasize Constructive Work

Pi Kappa Phi, President Mike
Herndon said, placed emphasis al-
most completely on constructive
work this year, following a trend set
in past years. The pledges worked
not only in the house, but for the
university and in the community.

Pi Phi pledges worked for the
welfare board moving food, moved
books for the library, helped a
needy farmer in the county, and
performed other similar jobs. Hern-
don commented: We feel that this is
a more reasonable approach to an
intensified pledge week.

“Very Successful”

IFC President Doenges said that
he felt the week was very success-
ful as a Help Week. Fraternities
placed more emphasis than ever be-
fore on community service, as op-
posed to hazing.

Alumni Seek Funnds:
Questionnaire Compiled

According to Bill Washburn,
Alumni Secretary, two major alumni
programs are in progress. The first
of these, the Occupations of Alumni
Program, has as its aim a file on
the occupations of all W&L alumni.
Questionnaires have ben sen _ to
10,996 and thus far 5,117 have been
returned. The program is later to
be incorporated into the IBM sys-
tem. Then completed statistics will
be available as to the exact num-
ber of professions represented. The
office has been encouraged by the
response the alumni have shown.
Estimated completion of the pro-
gram will be June.

The Annual Alumni Fund Pro-
gram of the 1961-62 fund year is to
be reactivated on a full scale basis.
In the last three years the alumni
office has not handled the full pro-
gram because the fund was merged
with the University Development
Program, which is responsible for
the various capital improvements
about the campus. The fund was
begun in 1933. That year gifts from
506 alumni for $3,700 were received.
During the 29-year interval the pro-
gram has steadily grown. The goal
set for this year is more than
$100,000, and a participation of at
least 70 per cent of all alumni is
expected.

THE RING-TUM PHI

The Dance Sets Are Back

It’s interesting how we tend to take things for granted here
at Washington and Lee. Take Fancy Dress for example. This
year’s Fancy Dress Dance Set provided excellent, up-to-date
entertainment. The Ball itself was an unqualified success. Ev-
eryone agreed that the Dave Brubeck concert was one of the
best in recent years. Even the Saturday night dance was well-
attended.

And yet, no one seems to remember that, this time last
year, the formal dance sets were the jokes of the campus and
dance plans were objects of general derision.

We are not going to scold the student body for not appre-
ciating Fancy Dress. We do think, however, that Steve Galef
and Frank Young deserve a special word of thanks. The bur-
den of responsibility for the dance sets lies almost entirely in
the hands of the President and Vice-President of the Dance
Board. These are thankless offices, despite the tremendous
amount of work involved. Galef and Young have not only
provided excellent entertainment, but have, by dint of imagina-
tion and hard work, lifted the dance sets out of last year’s mire,
a noteworthy accomplishment by anybody’s standards.

A word of thnks is also due the faculty committee on so-
cial events for giving them a chance to show what they could

do with a dance set, and to Dr. Jay Cook and Dr. Charles Phil-

lips for their patient service as Dance Board advisors.

 

A Welcome Discussion

It looks like this year’s International Relations Week, which
begins Tuesday, will be another outstanding event in the
school year. Professor John Gunn and Lance Tarrance deserve
a good deal of credit for bringing a distinguished set of speak-
ers to the campus.

Senator Gore’s announcement today that he will discuss
the United States policy in the Congo, together with Professor
Nawaz’s announced plans to discuss “The United Nations at
the Crossroads,” should encourage some much-needed discus-
sion at W&L on the role of the United States in the United
Nations. We hope that everyone who can will get down to Lee
Chapel for the sessions.

The New History Major

The announcement today that the history department
ment will offer advanced placement to qualified freshmen is
proof that the overall preparation and talent of Washington
and Lee students is going up every year. For the present fresh-
man history course is an excellent course in the hands of the
department’s overwhelming majority of good teachers. It is
a stimulating and challenging course to all but the very best stu-
dents.

Advanced placement, however, should be a great advantage
to students who enter here with a very good background in
European history. And it should prove further, as the pres-
ent highly successful advanced placement programs in mathe-
matics and English do, that the University is willing to let a
student go as far as he is able as fast as he can.

We will be waiting to see the specific requirements for the
Contemporary Civilization major. The University presents a
sound group of courses now in contemporary art, literature,
and history. But we believe that it is just as important for a man
to know about the Middle Ages, or the sixteenth century, as it
is to know about the events of the last 100 years. We are sure,
however, that the history department is not deluding students
into thinking that a thorough knowledge of contemporary
events is any substitute for a sound knowledge of the whole
span of human history. It does matter, a great deal, what the
ancient Greeks, or the Carolingians, or Louis XIV, did.

At The Fancy Dress Concert. . .

 

By TRACY HARRINGTON

When the Dave Brubeck Quartet
emerged from the West Coast in
the early 1950’s, its music was met
with severe criticism from the pub-
lic and jazz musicians alike. Today,
however, this same organization is
the most widely acclaimed, and
along with the Modern Jazz Quar-
tet, the highest paid jazz group in
the world. This meteoric rise can
be directly attributed to the growth
of the music style of the leader.

In the early years, Brubeck was
still much under the influence of
the classical pianists and composers.
He had studied with the great Dar-
ius Milhaud, a renowned classicist.
Because of this influence, the style of
Brubeck was heavy and awkward.
Since that time, he has undergone
a miraculous musicial transition. As
opposed to the heavy, early style, his
style today is a clean, driving one.

Paul Desmond

Along with Brubeck there is one
other man who has remained with
the group since its inception. This is
Alto Saxist Paul Desmond. Prob-
ably one of the most gifted lyrical
improvisers in jazz today, Desmond’s
worth to the group is one never to
be doubted. With complete com-
mand of his horn, his solos are a
wonder of perfect tonality, rhythm,
and imagination.

The bassist in today’s quartet,
Eugene Wright, is an unobtrusive

By HOWARD SLATER

Just as students attend college for
a number of seasons, so it is also
true that students give opinions and
write columns for more than one
reason. Usually they do so because
they believe in what they have to
say.

But saying that you _ support
something, or “stand” for something
is an entirely different matter often
from actually doing so. The occur-
ance of lip-service protestations
throughout the course of history are
sufficient proof of this phenomenon.

It is also true that this lip-service
does not necessarily have to be
hypocritical. I do believe, for ex-
ample, that the medieval Church
was sincere in its belief that it act-
ed rightfully as the agent of a mild,
forgiving Jesus, when it in fact
ruthlessly surpressed deviationists,
heretics, or whatever you prefer
to call those unfortunate wretches.

“Objectivity” Problem

Therefore,, we must, in fairness,
cast the benefit of doubt in favor of
the recent article, “Too Much Opin-
ion Puts Bias Into Some Courses.”
Probably, it was a sincere article.
However, being sincere about a sup-
posed belief is not the same thing as
actually holding this belief, as we
have seen. It is one thing to demand
objectivity from our professors; it is
another thing to spell out how this
objectivity ought to be achieved.
And when the attempt is made to
spell out what is objective, what
other result is there than the ex-
change of the student’s “objective
conclusions” in place of the profes-
sor’s “subjective” opinions?

Now who is going to seriously
contend that, in a comparison of a
student’s views and a_professor’s,
that the student’s are more valid? It
is ridiculous to argue that a man
who is, comparatively speaking, an

 

expert in his field ought to subor-
| dinate his value judgments to those
| of his students.

| This is not to say that teachers are
always right—there are always ex-
ceptions. But think of how workable
the educational system would be
if it were at the mercy of all opin-
ionated, so-called “critical” students.

Why Study?
Of course, the article asserted that
only “some courses’ are biased.

“Students attend college for many
and varied reasons.” Unfortunately,
one of these reasons is the desire to
find confirmation of what one al-
ready believes. Although “The true
educational process consists of pre-
senting and exploring a subject from
| all points of view,” there is abso-
| luately no sense to it whatsoever, if
| you come out of it the same as you
| went in, without testing any of these
views—especially the ones you went
in with.
Thus, I suspect that

biased courses” actually

 

the
refer

“some
to

| those in which conclusions were

made to which the writer was pre-
conceivedly disposed to disagree
with. In that case, what has hap-
pened to the “objectivity” which is

 

 

but very solid rhythm man. His solos
are often interjected with hilarious
quotes from other songs. His rhy-
thmical approach to the bass is one
which is very congenial to the
group as a whole.

Joe Morello

Drummer Joe Morello is perhaps
the key to the musical approach
of the group today. Unquestionably
one of the finest precussionists in
the world, Morello has influenced
explorations in diversified rhythms.
His work on the recent Time Out
and Time Further Out albums has
been nothing short of magnificent.
Many of these explorations were
taken from Indian and African sour-
es. No other drummer before Morel-
lo, with the possible exception of
Max Roach, was able to play such
rhythms with a jazz conception.
Because of the addition of Morello,
the music of Dave Brubeck has been
able to grow both harmonically and
rhythmically.

When the quartet played at Wash-
ington and Lee last Saturday after-
noon, it was met with tremendous
enthusiasm. The music of the day
was wonderfully balanced and ex-
pertly performed. From the opening
bars of the St. Louis Blues to Mo-
rello’s fantistic rhythmical display
in 5/4 time at the end, the quartet
played with a jazz feeling which
had almost all feet tapping.

The musical highlights of the day

our purported ideal? The proverb
about “people in glass houses” fits
very well here. But this, of course, is
my personal reaction to that arti-
cle, and hence, subjective. It il-
lustrates how difficult it is to ach-
ieve objectivity, and also possibly,
the utter futility of trying to argue
about anything. For this reason, give
credit to all those who realize this
paradox and yet continue the at-
tempt.

Let me make one final ‘personal’

 

 

A Review: The Brubeck Quartet

in this listener’s opinion were Bru-
beck’s driving solo on the first
number, Desmond’s wonderful lyric-
ism on just about everything he
played, but especially on Sewannee
River, and of course, Morello’s ex-
citing climax to the day.

Perhaps the finest number as a
whole was Gone With the Wind.
Everyone in the group seemed to
have high regard for the song and
played it with this same regard.

Brubeck The Composer

A special note, it may be added
that Brubeck is a fine composer as
well as a tremendous musician.
Two of the pieces he played Sat-
urday were his one compositions.
One, The Duke, he wrote as special
tribute to Duke Ellington. The other
was a wonderfully lyrical ballad en-
titled In Your Own Sweet Way. It
might be said that one of the finest
jazz recordings ever made was done
by Miles Davis, on this same ballad.

For those interested in recordings
by the quartet, there are many to
choose from. Perhaps the best re-
cording done in the 50’s by the
group was Jazz At Oberlin, on the
Fantasy record label. The group
played such famous jazz classics
as Perdido and How High the Moon.
Since the group switched to the
Columbia label, they have turned
out a great number of albums. The
finest of these are probably Gone
With the Wind and the recent Time
Out and Time Further Out.

On The Problem Of Biased Professors:
‘Objectivity’ Is A Much-maligned Word

observation. I do not believe that
the professors at this university are
biased. They have opinions, but I do
not think that these opinions per-
meate their classrooms. Recently,
I heard one professor remark, “Gen-
tlemen, if you are looking for an-
swers, forget it! There are no an-
swers in this course.” And then he
went on to point out his biases. God
bless the man, and all those like
him! I think they rule the roost
here.

There seems to be a good chance
that Ray Charles will play for
either a concert or a dance during
Spring Dances. Other possibilities
include Dave Guard, (a former
member of the Kingston Trio), Josh
White, and Charlie Byrd.

Dance Board President Steve
Galef had originally hoped to pro-
mote a folk music festival for
Spring Dances. He feels now, how-
ever, that there is not enough time
remaining to make the proper con-
tacts and preparations.

Uncas McThenia and others are
extremely interested in studying the
possibility of changes in the present
rush system. They feel that the
present system definitely has it’s
advantages, but that there are
changes that could be made which
would iron out some of the rough
edges, and improve the system as a
whole.

blazers, boaters, and bermuda shorts.
Dr. Atwood is sporting a very dia-
bolical moustache.

One picture is worth a thousand
words, they say.

There is a good chance that the
“High Society” theme used in this
year’s Fancy Dress Ball will be
made a permanent one. The theme
is especially well-suited to the de-
cor of Evans Dining Hall. Futher,
the cost of the costumes is consid-
erably less, which improves the at-
tendance at the dance.

Rumor has it that the announce-
ment on the new history major will
be followed by the announcement
of a new sociology major. Dr. Ley-

Johnny Quick
And The
American Way

By STEVE HENRY

What we would like to see around
this campus is a Johnny Quick fan
club.

Did you ask who Johnny Quick
is? Well, we'll tell you. He is the
greatest. He is Barry Goldwater,
Douglas McArthur, Teddy Roose-
velt, and John Birch, all wrapped
up in one. Wow!

When Johnny Quick acts, the
world takes notice. Take, for ex-
ample, last month when he person-
ally righted the wrongs of a Latin
American dictator who had been re-
sponsible for the hijacking of one of
Johnny’s planes. (Johnny, you see,
is no small operator).

The Butcher of Tributo

When Johnny found out that his
plane was being held on the small
island of Tributo (any similarity to
Cuba is incidental), he sent a tele-
gram to the dictator in which he
said the following: “Release the
plane, you fat butcher, or we'll hang
you for piracy!”

Well, you can guess the outcome
for yourself. The Fat Butcher (who,
incidentally, had a beard and was a
Commie), refused to release the
plane, so Johnny hopped up from
his desk, enlisted the aid of a few
commandoes, whipped down to Tri-
buto, and hanged the Fat Butcher.
Take that, you nasty old dictator!

Now there’s an example of real
Americanism. It’s like one of John-
ny’s admirers said, “You don’t often
see that kind of courage in an Am-
erican any more.”

Johnny got himself into a pretty
bad predicament in Tributo, though.
The Fat Butcher’s comrades were
relatively hacked off, and were clos-
ing in on Johnny for the kill.

Enter Daddy Warbucks

But, then, but then, but then!
Along came THE man Daddy War-
bucks. (Darn it, you’ve guessed it.
We're talking about a comic strip.)

Daddy Warbucks whisked Johnny
away without a scratch. They ended
up at Big Daddy’s secret hideaway,
and in the process managed to sink
an atomic Russian trawler that was
intent on ending their illustrious
careers.

Their troubles weren’t over, even
at Daddy’s pad. Not by a long shot.
Those nasty old whatevertheyweres
still wanted revenge, and dropped
200 crack parachuters down to put
the quietus on Johnny and Daddy.

It took OUR boys about two days
to wipe out the 200 parachuters, an-
other example of the obvious su-
periority of the Western mind.

Oh, this really made those other
people mad. They decided to wipe
up the entire island with an H-
bomb. Guess what! Big Daddy had a
ray gun stashed away in some dark
corner, with which he shot down the
foreign planes carrying the bombs.
WHOOM! The bombs went off, right
in the middle of a Russian ship. End
of bad guys, hooray for good guys!

Deus Ex Machina?

The last time we looked, Johnny,
Daddy, and Annie were standing
around, commenting on how tense
things had been. Every once in a
while, someone would throw in one
of those priceless little pearls of
wisdom like, “That just shows you
that nothing can beat good old
Yankee ingenuity.” (After all, ev-
ery Yank has a ray gun in his
house.) Or, “True Americans aren’t
afraid to act.” (Rise, W&L, to Cuba.
We'll hang old Fidel in the morn-
ing.)

But, halt. Before we go, perhaps
we need a little organization. That’s
why we need a Johnny Quick Fan
Club. Every other organization on
campus gets members without even
trying. It’s only logical that some-
thing really worthwhile like the
JQFC could attract throngs.

Would some responsible leader,
who worships the ground that John-
ny and Warbucks walk on, and be-
lieves in everything they advocate,
get to work on the student body?

It could be the greatest.

One final warning, though. Don’t
get indoctrinated in the process.
Join the JQFC because you feel it
in your heart, not because someone
tells you it might be the nice thing
to do. Please?

Editor’s Note:

This is typical of the type of sub-
versive propaganda that is flooding
our American college campuses. We
are surprised that it came from
Washington and Lee and not from
some hotbed of liberalism like Har-
vard or the Patrice Lumumba Uni-
versity in Moscow. Any way you
look at it, the obvious point is
that the current scare about com-
symps is real. Fellow-travellers are

Fauber Leads
In Rebounds,
Total Points

Captain Rodger Fauber leads
Washington and Lee’s basketball
team in scoring, rebounding, and

foul shooting, according to statis-
tics released today.

Through ten games, which saw
the Generals compile a 4-6 over-
all record, Fauber has collected a
team-leading 143 points, a 14.3 per
game average.

He’s also made 41 out of 51 free
throws for an 80.4 percentage, and
has pulled down 174 rebounds for a
17.4 per game average.

Fauber’s field goal percentage is
a creditable 40.5 per cent, but is only
the third best on the team.

Tom Supak, hitting at a 44.7 per
cent clip, leads the Generals in that
area. Freshman guard Louie Paterno
is second with 41 per cent.

Paterno leads the Generals in foul
shooting percentage, having made
29 out of 35 for an 82.8 percentage.

Supak and Paterno are the only
Generals besides Fauber averaging
in double figures for the year. Supak
has a 12.7 per game average, and
Paterno has 12.5 per game.

In rebounding, Bill Ide is second
to Fauber with a 7.9 per game av-
eragfie. Bill Smith is third in this
important area with 6.1 rebounds
per game.

Ide is averaging nine points a
game, and Smith 4.4.

Individual highs for the year are
as follows:

Total points: Fauber, 31, against
Franklin and Marshall.

Field goals; Tom Supak,
against Lynchburg.

Free throws: Fauber, 11 for 13
against Franklin and Marshall.

Rebounds: Fauber, 28, against
Norfolk William and Mary.

Team highs for the year:

Field goals: 30 against Franklin
and Marshall.

Free throws attempted: 36 against
Norfolk William and Mary.

Free throws made: 26 against
Franklin and Marshall.

Personal fouls: 24 against Franklin
and Marshall.

For the year the Generals are
shooting at a 36 per cent clip, while
opponents are getting 38 per cent
of their field goal attempts down.

W&L is averaging 65.2 points per
game, and opponents are averag-
ing 68.0.

Thackston, Rutledge Ready

For the first time this year, both
Brett Thackston and Steve Rutledge
will be available for action.

Thackston, ineligible until second
semester this year, has been work-
ing out with the varsity since Fancy
Dress, and will see considerable
action Saturday.

Rutledge, out with injuries for
most of the first semester, saw
limited action against Norfolk Wil-
liam and Mary, but has rounded
into shape since then and will be
ready to go Saturday.

Both Thackston and Rutledge were
starters last year.

Cagers Ready For Tigers;

Play In Gym

Saturday

Washington and Lee’s basketball team launches a stretch
drive for its first .500 season in six years Saturday night against

Hampden-Sydney’s Tigers.

The Generals, who posted a 4-6*
mark in the first half of the season,
return to action after a three-week
layofl with a strong possibility of
turning in a .500 season.

“But we have to win our next
two home games (Hampden-Sydney
and Roanoke next Wednesday),”
Coach Bob McHenry cautions.

Hampden-Sydney, the number
two team in Virginia’s little Eight
offers a formidable stumbling block
in the Generals’ path to their .500
goal. The Tigers decisioned W&L,
717-66, at Hampden-Sydney January
9 despite the fact that the Generals
played one of their best games of
the year, according to McHenry.

The main reason that Washington
and Lee lost was a 6-2 forward
named Bill Hardin. Hardin, the
state’s leading scorer, poured in 32
points as he paced the Tiger attack.

McHenry already has_ several
good-working defenses, but he is
adding a special one for the Hamp-
den-Sydney game.

“I just hope we can play the kind
of defense we played against Nor-

 

folk William and Mary in our last
game,” the coach said. “They came
into the game with a 7-2 record and
we put the pressure on them. Con-
sequently, they hit only 15 per cent
from the floor the first half.

“They weren't off, either. Our
defense stopped them. In the sec-
ond half they hit 40 per cent but
that was because our boys got
tired.” McHenry said.

WAL, which built up a 32-18 half-
time lead, defeated the Monarchs,
71-58.

Defense has been the key to
W&L’s limited success so far this
season, and surprisingly enough, the
key to the W&L defense has been
freshman guard Louie Paterno.

“Paterno really made our defense
work against Norkolk,’ McHenry
said.

Paterno along with captain Rodger
Fauber and guard Tom Supak carry
the brunt of the W&L offensive at-
tack. All three are averaging over 12
points per game.

Generals Ready To Begin Spring
Football Practice This Monday

 

Hickey, Essex
Competing In
Enquirer Meet

Washington and Lee
Jim Hickey and Skip Essex left
yesterday for Philadelphia where
they will compete in the Enquirer
Games today.

Hickey, the state 100-yard cham-
pion, will run in the 50-yard sprint
in Philadelphia. Essex will enter the
1000-yard run.

In the VMI relays last week,
Hickey won his heat in the 60-yard
dash, but finished an overall fifth
behind runners from Navy, Mary-
land, and North Carolina.

Shuttle Run

Washington and Lee entered only
one other event besides the 60-yard
dash, and that was the Sprint Shut-
tle Relay.

A General team composed of
Chris Kell, Hickey, John Pearson
and Jordan Smith placed sixth in
the relay.

W&L track coach Norm Lord said
he was “well pleased” with his en-
trants’ performances in the relays,
and is “looking forward to another
successful track season this spring.”

Next week, Coach Lord will take
his indoor trackmen back to VMI
for the Virginia State Indoor Track
meet.

 

Peter Winnfield Takes
Starting Wrestling Role

Peter Winnfield, a second semes-
ter freshman, has won a starting
position on the Washington and Lee
wrestling team for the Duke match
tomorrow at 3 p.m.

Winnfield defeated Chick Owens in
a challenge match Wednesday, 5-1.

Another freshman, Charlie Dick-
inson, will take over in the 130-
opund class against Duke for co-
captain Dave Montgomtry, who sus-
tained a serious foot injury over
Fancy Dress week-end and is in-
definitely sidelined.

Bo Jones ,who usually wrestles
behind Montgomery in the 130-
pound division, is still out of action
with a broken ankle.

Spring football practice at Washington and Lee gets un-
derway Monday, with 31 lettermen from last year’s undefeated

team expected to return.

For the last three years, spring*
practice has been sharply curtailed
by snow and ice, but head coach
Lee McLaughlin is hoping the
weather man will give him a break
this year.

“We need more pleasant weather
just so we can see better what we’ve
got,” he said.

On paper, McLaughlin hasn't
really got too much to worry about.
In addition to the 31 returnees,
which include standouts Bob Payne,
Charlie Gummey, Tommy Keesee,
and Chuck Lane, there’ll be 25 fresh-
men on hand to add depth to the
squad.

 

Golfers Will Begin Spring
Practice Meets on March 1

Washington and Lee’s golf team
will begin organized practice on
March 1 in preparation for the
spring season, it was announced to-
day by golf coach E. P. (Cy) Twom-
bly.

Six lettermen return from last
year’s squad that posted a 7-2 sea-
son’s record, and placed fourth in
the state tournament at Hot Springs.

Two four-year lettermen, Captain
Grantham Couch and former state
collegiate champion Jack Varda-
man lead the returnees, who also in-
clude Will Lee, Ron Stewart, War-
ren Hughes, and Steve Henry.

Coach Twombly has added two
more men, juniors Paul McBride
and Bill Wyly, to his squad, making
a total of eight men on the team.
Six men play in each match.

McLaughlin himself admitted that
things should be good around Wil-
son Field this year.

“We've lost 18 fine football play-
ers, he said. “But we’re expecting
the sophomore and juniors to come
through for us. If our returning
boys accept their responsibility
we’re not very anxious about next
year.”

One a Day

McLaughlin has scheduled two
weeks of spring practice, with one
session on tap every day.

Practice will begin daily at 4
p.m., and wrap up around 5:30.
Equipment will be issued at 3 p.m.
Monday.

At the end of the two week
period, there will be an Alumni-
Intersquad game, scheduled for Sat-
urday, February 24. Former W&L
stars Courtney Mauzy and Bob
Funkhouser have already planned
to suit up for the game, and other
interested alumni are being con-
tacted.

Here’s a breakdown of how
many players should return at each
position this spring:

Left end, three.

Left tackle, three.

Left guard, two.

Center, two.

Right guard, two.

Right tackle, three.

Right end, two.

Left half, four.

Fullback, three.

Right half, three.

Quarterback, four.

This doesn’t include freshmen.

How The Ring-tum Phi Got Its Name

The name “Ring-tum Phi” sounds
more like a yell than the name of a
college paper, it should because it is.

Back in 1897, one of the Generals’
yells went like this:

Ring-tum Phi
Stickeri bun
We're hot stuff
From Lexington
Rah, Rah, Rah!
White and Blue
Whoopla, whoopla!
W.L.U.

Not only was that a college yell
back in 1897, but it was the only one
Washington and Lee had.

So, naturally or not, when J. Sam
Slicer and Gordon R. Houston
founded the paper in that year they
chose the name Ring-tum Phi. It
was also picked to signify “The
Voice of the Student Body.”

The two Ring-tum Phi founders
had few financial troubles in that

 

day and time. Advertisements were

plentiful. Local merchants found
their ads well-read because the edi-
tors slipped in such little gems of
fact as this one:

A Little Gem

“Found—in front of Dr. Howe’s,
shoe, number 3!%. Having a long
tongue it is supposed to be of fem-
inine gender.—R.E.L.”

The “Ring-tum Phi” yell was
discarded in 1900 but the newspaper
has continued under that name until
the present.

The fourteenth issue of the Ring-
tum Phi was published on Saturday
January 15, 1898. The Southern Col-
legian had already been established
for the lead article in the paper
described the articles in the forth-
coming issue of the Collegian.

A news story on the third page
of this issue of the paper is head-
lined “Miss Carmichael’s Dancing
Class Closes with a Flourish.” The
article goes to say:

 

49 Listed On Honor Roll

Forty-nine students made Honor
Roll grades for the first semester of
the 1961-62 school year, including
eight freshmen. Eight students made
a perfect 3.0 grande-point ratio.

These figures may be compared to
the figures for the first semester of
the 1960-61 school year. At that
time, fifty-eight students were on
the Honor Roll, including nine
freshmen and nine students with
3.0 averages.

Houses Abolish Hell Week

(Continued from page 1)

ish Hell Week, Doenges said that he
felt a great change was innovated
this year, and that even greater
modification would come next year

Dr. Louis Hodges, Asst. Profes-
sor of Religion, spoke from a facul-
ty viewpoint: The administration
will probably crack down on Hell
Week unless fraternities substitute
a more constructive program for the
traditional pledge abuse.

Mr. William Chaffin, speech in-
structor, noted: Hell Week has
no place on the campus of a modern
university.

 

J. T. Russell, Librarian

J. Thomas Russell has resigned as
Washington and Lee’s Public Serv-
ices Librarian to accept a position
at the Naval Weapons Laboratory at
Dahlgren.

A member of the McCormick Li-
brary staff here since 1959, Russell
will become Reader Services Li-
brarian at the Naval Installation
near Fredericksburg.

Russell’s successor has not been
named to date, Henry E. Coleman,
university librarian, said.

He received his bachelor of arts
degree in 1957 from Kenyon Col-
lege and his master of arts degree
in 1959 from the University of
Michigan. He also attended the Uni-
versity of Maryland.

Russell, 26, served as assistant to
the cataloguer at the Navy’s David
Taylor Model Basin, Carderock,
Md., in 1958. He taught public school
in Leesburg in 1957. He is a native
of Washington, D.C.

no illusion, friends.

Just as the Communists are try-
ing to destroy the House Un-Amer-
ican Activities Committee by calling
for their civil rights as Americans
under the Fifth Amendment, the au-
thor of this little bit of subversion
and hand-biting has chosen to at-
tack one of our most venerable and
respected free institutions—Daddy
Warbucks. He would feel that War-
bucks is not a great hero but rather
a despised capitalist and enemy of
the working gclasses, an imperialist
who no doubt has ties with a Fas-
cist organization like the OAS.

We also get the impression that
the Fat Butcher is not a cowering
slob but a_ bright-eyed idealist.
Really now!

What we need in the United
States is a johnny Quick-Daddy
Warbucks fan club. He, like
Barry Goldwater and Douglas Mac-
Arthur, typifies the great Ameri-
can virtues of Resourcefulness,
Patriotism and Love of the Land
that we so desperately need in this
modern age. Rise, up Real Ameri-
cans, rally behind the Star-Span-
gled Banner, and smite down those
scoffers at our Free Way of Life.

quickly added, “Circumstances

we did this that my opinion now
would prove practically worthless.”

EC Will Study New Constitution

The first draft of a proposed
constitution for Washington and
Lee’s Student Body was present-
ed to the Executive Committee for
further study at last night’s EC
meeting.

Presented by the EC’s Sub-
Committee on Constitution Re-
forms, the proposed constitution
includes some of the reform which
were submitted to the EC earlier
this year.

The new constitution, as was
presented by the sub-committee,
would include the following major
changes:

1. A new method of electing of-
ficers, by means of changing the
criterium for candidacy for a Stu-
dent Body office.

2. A partial re-vamping of rep-
resentation to the Executive Com-
mittee.

The new constitution proposes
that the method of electing of-

ficers of the Student Body be

changed. The draft states:

Candidates shall be chosen in
the following manner: any student
desiring to place his name in can-
didacy for a Student Body office
or position of honor as previous-
ly defined shall present to the Exec-
utive Committee a petition bearing
a minimum of fifty signatures and
a statement of the position for
which he wishes his name placed
in the candidacy.

Here-to-fore, candidates were
selected by means of a nominat-
ing convention held annually in
Lee Chapel. At that time, the po-
litical parties would present their
candidates for nomination.

In changing the system

a

     

resentation, the new constitution
calls for (1) the elimination of
the representative from the Pub-
lications Board (2) the elimination
of one of the two representatives
from the Senior Class, and (3) the
addition of two representatives to
be chosen from the Student Body
at large.

The remainder of the proposed
changes presented in the suggest-
ed constitution are only of a min-
or nature..

“These changes, Student Body
President Uncas McThenia said,
“only encompass the elimination
of a lot of unnecessary words.”

The other changes, he said, are
designed to streamline the Con-

ese

stitution, by including sections
under single topics, rather than
under several headings.

Secretary of the Student Body
Steve Suttle told the Ring-tum
Phi last night that the new draft
envisioned changes only up to
Section VIII of the old Constitu-
tion.

Members of the EC will study
the constitution this week, and
will discuss additional suggestions
and changes at next week’s meet-
ing, he added.

Before any plan is submitted to
voting, McThenia stated, an open
forum will be held for interested
persons, at which time the issues
will be discussed by the EC. Stu-

ES:

+

dents will be allowed to ask ques-
tions about the proposed changes
during the forum.

The first three articles, Suttle
said, will be voted on by the EC
first. (These sections contain the
clauses that would change voting
and nominating procedures.)

“By no means,” McThenia em-
phasized, “does the presentation
of the first draft by the Sub-
Committee of the EC mean that
the EC will adopt the proposed
constitution as it now stands.

The EC members will come back
next week, and at that time will
make suggestions for future revi-
sions and for additional changes.”

The EC will vote on the new

pia anne cne cece anececaaee aceon

   

constitution, he added, only after
careful consideration is given to
additional suggestions received by
the EC.

After hearing proposed changes,
and suggestions, he continued, the
EC will then vote whether or not
to accept the new constitution.

Following the EC’s vote (if affir-
mative) the constitution will then
be presented to the Student Body
in the form of a genereal referen-
dum.

The details of the referendum,
McThenia_ said, will be an-
nounced at a later time.

Due to the limited amount of
space available in today’s paper,
it was physically impossible to
reprint the entire proposed con-
stitution.

“It is our hope,” he added,
“that the Ring-tum Phi can per-
haps print the entire article in

the future, but limited space pre-
vents such printing today.”

School Offers New Sociology Major For ’

Sen. Gore Opens Internatioal Relations Week Tonight

Leyburn To Head Department;

Courses Added

To Curriculum

BY STEVE GUILD

Executive News Editor

A new major in sociology and anthropology will be offered

at Washington and Lee beginni
today. Several new courses will

ng next fall, it was announced

be added to those already of-

fered by the department next year and additional ones will be

offered the following year.

The sociology and anthropology major will fill the gap that
has existed in the field of social sciences at the University.

The major will require 18 hours of work in the department
above the introductory courses, Social Anthropology (Soci-
ology 101) and General Sociology (Sociology 102).

Professor James G. Leyburn will*
be the head of the department and
will continue to teach his courses
in Anthropology and General So-
ciology.

In addition, next year he will
teach Religion and Society, and
Africa South of the Sahara.

In the fall of 1963, he will begin
teaching two additional courses,
Race and Comparative Cultures. Dr.
Leyburn will continue to teach his
courses in Ancient History and
Greek and Latin Classics, but will
drop the course Introduction to Po-
litical Science.

Professor Marshal Fishwick will
continue teaching the courses in
Cultural Regions of the United
States and Society and Thought in
America.

Several new courses, however,
will be added to the department.

A new man, who will join the
faculty next September, will teach
courses in The City, Population, So-
cial Institutions, Seminar in Soci-
ology Theory, and the Individual
in Society.

In addition to these courses, Pro-
fessor Westbrook Barritt will teach a
course in Structural Linguistics..

The course will be centered around
the study of the nature of language,
how it is composed, and how it is a
symbolic activity of man. This will be
the only course that Dr. Barritt will
teach in the new department.

Dr. Leyburn’s course in Africa
South of the Sahara will deal with
that portion of Africa, its life and cul-
ture, and its relationship to the pres-
ent-day world.

In the fall of 1963, three new courses
wil be added to the department which
will bring the total to 17.

These will be Dr. Leyburn’s Race
and Comparative Cultures courses and
the new faculty member’s course,
Methods in Sociology. There will also
be Senior Thesis, a course which will
be for honors work.

In general, there will be nine new
courses added next year in the de-
partment and four the following year
plus the Senior Thesis course. The
courses below 250 generally will be

 

 

for juniors or below, while courses
numbered 250 and above will be prin-
cipally senior level work.

A comprehensive examination,
which will be given at the end of the
senior year will be required of all ma-
jors in sociology and anthropology.

Bill Noell Named Best Debater
At King’s College Tournament

By C. C. FLIPPEN
Associate Editor
Topping a field of 136 contestants, Bill Noell, Washington
and Lee sophomore from West Virginia was named best de-

| bater at the King’s College Debate Tournament held this week-

‘and at Wilkes-Barre, Penn.

— : *
In winning the title, Noell earned

| 111 points out of a possible 125 for the
| five debates he took part in. He edged
|out his nearest competitor, a student
| from Augustana College, by one point.

“We were very fortunate, indeed,”
Noell said. “This was perhaps the
toughest tournament I have even tak-
en part in.

“It was what is known as a strength
meets strength tournament. That is
winning teams meet only winning
teams and losing teams meet losing
teams,” he said.

The negative team composed of
Noelll and Al Eckes was undefeated.
None of the other 67 teams at the
meet matched this record.

 

 

up the affirmative team, compiled a
2-5 record.

As a whole the W&L team finished
fourth at the 12th annual tournament.
Augustana, Scranton, and Dartmouth
took the three top positions,

In the coming two weeks the team
will take part in two more debate con-
tests and will hold a demonstration
debate for a nearby high school.

On Wednesday they will be in
Blacksburg to meet the VPI debate
team, and on Feb. 23 they will take
part in the Mt. Mercy Debate Tourna-
ment in Pittsburgh, Penn.

Monday will see the team appearing
before a Roanoke high school. Wash-

emy of Social Sciences, and Phi Beta
Kappa.

Under the direction of Dr. Bean,
the department of history has been
expanded and broadened. The in-
structors in the department have
been increased considerably over the
years.

In the Twenties Washington and
Lee’s history department consisted
of but three full time professors.
Today the department is made up
of eight full time professors and
two part time instructors.

The curriculum has been modi-
fied and expanded. The department
offers majors in American History,
European History, and in the recent-

| ly added field of Contemporary Civi-
| lization.

While the department has always
been strong in the field of American
History, considerable advances have
been made in other areas. European
history has received much attention
and new courses have been offered
in this field.

In addition such courses as Modern
Russian History, the History of
the Near East, and Latin American
History have been added.

Since the end of the Second World
War, the curriculum has been ex-
panded and broadened.

In addition, the History Depart-
ment has been active in the field of
senior honors work. Each year there
are participants in this field.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

By DR. CHARLES W. TURNER
Professor of History

The nations watch with excit-
ment the current rift between the
Soviet Union and Communist
China. Especially since 1958, a
number of points of disagreement
have developed in the “Leaning-
to-One Side Policy” forged be-
tween the two powers in the
Treaty of Alliance and Friendship
of thirty years duration made in
1950. This had come after “Mao-
ism” had claimed the mainland
from the Kuomintang Party. The
point made, at the time of the
signing, that is marked a high
point in a long courtship that had
its beginning with the signing of
the Nerchinsky Treaty of 1689.
The latter had been another “first”
for Russia in that she was the first
European power to make a treaty

 

with China. If one looks more
closely in the period 1689-1950
there will be found many instances
where their courtship ador had
cooled. Such time as when, in the
late 19th century, Russia tried to
cut a “sphere of influence” in
North China using a “railroad
right-of-way sovereignty” tech-
nique. Everywhere railroad spikes
were driven down Russian politi-
cal sovereignty was exerted. A
second distance, when Stalin sup-
ported Li Li-san’s type of com-
munism as against that of Mao’s
in Yenan in the 1930’s. To make
his support more confusing why
did he agree to the Soong-Molotov
Agreement of 1946? To be sure,
the last might have been “zig-
zag” game ait its best.

The spirit of cooperation reached
a peak by 1958. In the period of

1950-’58 both sides lauded each
other in flowery terms. The treaty
of 1950 contained Russian prom-
ises of military, economic and cul-
tural aid to China. Spelt out this
aid meant the sending of some
11,000 engineers, a student ex-
change program, a _  $300,000,000
at 1%, the joint control of both
the Manchurian railroads and the
port facilities of ports Arthur and
Darien. There soon followed the
organization of four joint stock
companies for the tapping of the
oil and mining in the border areas
of Manchuria and Sinkiang. To
promote the honeymoon a Sino-
Friendship Association of forty
million members was formed. In
1953, when the Chinese started
their Five Year Plan, Russia ex-
tended aid for several hundred
specific industrial projects. Fur-

ther loans were negotiated, as well
as, the port facilities of the above
ports which were turned over to
the Chinese in 1955.

Russia, meanwhile, was helping
China in the Korean War, sup-
porting her claims for Formosa
and the off-shore islands, as well
as, her seat in the United Nations.
This has been done with the Rus-
sian acknowledgement that China
was a co-equal and not a sattelite.
China praised Russia’s sending up
the “sputnik” and named its first
rural commune after it. Mao had
this to say at the time, “I think
the characteristics of the current
situation is that the east wind pre-
vails over the west wind; that is,
the strength of socialism exceeds
imperialism.”

By now, the bases of unity
were a common ideology, aims,
enemies had mutual help. Yet, af-

It has often been said that our Univer-
sity is recognized as being one of the South’s
best. We have been ranked, in recent years,
as “one of the top” small, all men’s colleges
in the nation. We have been praised and
praised for our progress we have attained in
many directions.

Our heritage gives us the obligation to
strive ahead and always to keep in our minds
the idea that improvement is the only answer
to having a truly successful university. We
must never forsake those who have worked
so long and hard for the improvement that
has been obtained.

The University’s announcement of to-
day, to come to the somewhat belated point,

ments which constanly are bickering
among themselves.

Some of our departments fail to see,
we must interject, the overall idea of the
University—that what aids one department
will in the end, aid them all.

Our gymnasium is wholly outdated. Suf-
fering from the lack of adequate facilities
which could be used as an assembly hall,
we are obliged to continue using what we
have in the hopes that eventually a brighter
day will make its overdue appearance.

By no means, we wish to reiterate, do
we question those in authority—we merely
wish to point to the fact that there definitely

ter both had tested themselves, by
a sort of flexing their muscles ef-
fort, China with her “100 Flowers
Campaign,” and the Russians with
their Anti-Party Struggle, the dif-
ferences appeared quite evident.
These differences came, according
to Professor H. H. Fisher of Mills
College, for main four main rea-
sons. Differences because of varied
national interests, over strategy
for the spread of Communism,
contrary interpretations of Marx-
Lenin Doctrine and finally as to
how to maintain monolithic soli-
darity. To elaborate on the dif-
ference over Marx-Lenin inter-
pretations, as to the inevitability
of war with the non-Communist

nations, for example, Khrushchev
holds it is not inevitable while
Mao feels it is. The Chinese feel
local “brush fire” wars are neces-
sary. The Russians discourage
these as being too dangerous.
Capitalism can only be overthrown
with violence says the Maoist,
while the Russian way is that of

CHINA IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE ANTI-RUSSIAN

Red World Not ‘Peaches And Cream’

China feels this is too hard on real
revolutionaries. Finally, both dif-
fer as to what to call the present
period in terms of their cherished
ideology.

Acutally, it seems a sort of law
of uneven development is opera-
tive in both of the countries and
that is making for the main stress-

that a new major of Sociology and Anthro-
pology will be made available to Washing-
ton and Lee students next year, is whole-
heartedly recognized by the Tuesday Edition
as being a new and bold step forward.

Coupled with Friday’s announcement
that the new Contemporary Civilization ma-
jor will go into effect next fall, it appears to
us that the general direction which has and
is being followed by the Administration
seems to indicate that academic excellence
is being achieved.

Desiring not to overdramatize the fact
that our University is ‘‘so ideal,’ we will suf-
fice to say that the new majors will allow our
students to explore new ideas and concepts—
a factor welcomed by any university or col-
lege.

We must admit, however, that
there is always a need for even more
more improvement. We also feel we
must emphasize that we are confident
that the “New Era”’ will see that these
improvements can and will come
when if the occasion ever presents
itself.

Recognizing that financial aid is the key
to better and new improvements, we wish
to explain that although improvements do
not perhaps come as fast as we would desire
to have them, we can certainly understand
the problems which are involved.

We also can understand that financial
problems are difficult to overcome, much less
solve.

Our new science facilities appear to be
taking definite shape at this printing, and
a newly arrived era of advancement, we feel,
has at at last gotten off to a concrete start.

We cannot allow, however, the crying
needs for improvements to go unnoticed.

Our facilities in journalism, for example,
reek with a general state of antiquation.

Some of our classrooms look no better,
in many respects, than when General Lee
directed our University.

Our library leaves much to be de-
sired in the way of completeness; the
departmental libraries in most instan-
ces are highly unorganized, outdated,
and in far too many cases, have be-
come the “status symbols” of depart-

ment in our University.

We also realize that many of the areas
for improvement mentioned above already
have concrete plans concerning their com-
pletion. It is encouraging to us to see that
there are definite plans in the making.

We can, as we said earlier, understand
the main problem involved—that of finances.
But new starts must have a beginning some-
where.

Since the general topic of “inadequate
finances” has been hit upon as being the
general culprit, let us advise, if we may
be allowed to incapably attempt, that a new
day be begun in the area of financial pro-

curement.

Let us once again launch a devel-
opment plan that would have as its
ultimate goal the realization of our
provements to insure that our inad-

equacies in

an even shorter time in

the future are corrected.

We would suggest that the prog-
rams now in existence which are de-
signed to increase our income from
all possible sources be stepped up and

augmented.

Let our alumni be made to realize that
Washington and Lee is more than a Univer-
sity located in a quaint little Virginia town.

We must make the world know of our
past, our present, and of most importance,
of our promising future.

What we need, to be blunt, is a “great

deal of money.’

>

Money won’t come from heaven, we can
assure our readers; but it will eventually
come, we feel sure, if a stern and dilligent
attempt is made to secure it.

Let not only our alumni who reside in

Let us show our generous benefactors,
without whose aid we could have never come
this far, that Washington and Lee does have
a bright and an even more promising future.

Let those who are associated in any way
with our University be shown that we are
overly eager to adyance; that we are eager to
become the best the South has to offer.

There is a nationally syndicated*
columnist, Sidney J. Harris, who is
continually writing down what pass
for witticisms under the title of
“Purely Personal Prejudices,” and
one of my PPP is against Sidney J.
Harris.

So, my Purely Personal Prejud-
ices:

The basketball team should be
teken over to the Troub Theatre
and put their com-
edies on stage. I
don’t mean to be
disrespectful of
honest, effort, and
I’m sure the team
is trying, but still
it’s hilarious.

And after last
Saturday’s game,
I’m not sure that
the basketball
scandal might not
spread to Lexing-

   

Craven

ton.

When the point spread stays at
one level for the last thee minutes,
and a sure shot by Fauber is
blocked by his own teammates
when then get the ball and throw
it out of bounds, I can hardly
avoid thinking of Aaron Wagman
and his hoods.

I realize, of course, that athletic
teams at this University are beyond
reproach because they’re amateurs.
Likewise the coaches.

Steve Henry has already found
out what it is to speak a disparag-
ing word, and I guess the powers-
that-be will settle some horrible
punishment (like making me pay
admission) on me if I lapse into
bad taste concerning the basketball
team.

But still I can’t help thinking that
basketball at this school laeves a
little to be desired, especially af-
ter a few the exhibitions this sea-
son.

Not wanting to limit my comments
to disparaging criticism, I'll try to
make some constructive remarks
when I can think of them.

One complaint I can offer the
team is that they're strong on
aesthetics. What they are able to
do on the floor may not win ball
games, but it looks good.

Take for instance, the fake as it
is used here. Never is it followed up
by a score, but it looks good every
time.

Along this same line is the gentle-
manly conduct of the team (in keep-
ing with the traditions of the school)

 

 

as it refuses to take unfair advant-

age of its opponents.

When the other team is forced
to relinquish possession as a re-
sult of some violation, it seems to
be our policy to give them back
the ball without taking a shot in
order not to make them feel bad.
Good sports we are, and winning
is indeed of secondary importance.

I’m not a sportswriter, so my views
on this subject don’t have to be
taken seriously. And as I’ve said, I
realize the team is trying.

But I’m still wondering what
they’re trying. I also realize that
the team is usually at a disadvant-
age because of height problems. But

 

(Continued on page four)

is becoming more and more cer-
tain that the strain in relations is
real. The press of the Chinese
carries more and more anti-Rus-
sian articles while the Russians
have replied that since their help
has not been appreciated by China
it will be gradually withdrawn, as
indeed some of it has. Meetings
of the party organizations are be-
ing held and planned for the next
months. Before these meetings,
efforts will be made to compro-
mise the issues at stake. Failing
here, there will start a competi-
tive struggle to win the nations of
three continents into one power
“block” or the other. Once again,
it is pleasant to see that in the
Communist world life is not all
“peaches and cream.”

 

 

Outman Clarifies Action
Hopes To Eliminate Confusion A bout Case

Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Tuesday Edition

Dear Roy,
There are two matters involving
the Student Control Committee

which need clarification at this time;
and, as chairman
of this group, I
feel that Iam ina
position to explain
the committee’s
posture on a re=
cent violation.
First, it has
been popularly as-
sumed by some
: individuals that
: the recent § an-
Outman nouncement bear-
ing the signature of Dean E. C.
Atwood concerning an incident of
misconduct at a local restaurant
should be directly attributed to him
or to the Faculty Administrative
Committee. Such an assumption has
no validity; the Student Control
Committee acted on this incident
and the announcement stated such,

  
   

although it bore Dean Atwood’s
signature.
The Student Control Committee

has, during the past month, issued
three reports to the Faculty Ad-
ministrative Committee and it has
been their purpose to review SCC
action and in no instance has the

 

Faculty Committee recommended
any additions or corrections to the |

By Control Committee;

submitted reports.

Second, the punitive action taken
in the case at hand needs certain
clarifications.

The above-mentioned incident in-
volved a non-fraternity freshman,
and in considering the student’s
status, while reviewing the case, the
committee felt that punishment, of
the nature invoked, was necessary.
Now it has come to my attention
that certain individuals have re-
acted to this punitive action of the
committee—namely, the “campus-
ing” of the student for one month—
as being “childish,” “immature,” and
“prep-schoolish.”

In the light of this attack, it may
be beneficial to present a few rele-
vant points. First, the incident was
of such a nature that it could not
be shrugged off easily. There was
a most ungentlemanly display of
conduct, and property damage re-
sulted from the student’s actions.

With this realization in mind, the
committee endeavored to associate
punitive action with the case. As
the student was not a member of
any social fraternity, social restric-
tion could in no way be sufficient
punishment.

There was no precedent of action
taken on misconduct by a non-fra-
ternity student which the committee
could impose and still bear relevance
to the case at hand.

The committee feels the punish-
ment was relevant and proper since

POPE FOOTIE

We notice that the sport of pocket billiards continues to
tide the wave of popularity initiated by the showing of The
Hustler, this January.

The flick, presented at the State Theatre, starred Paul
Newman, Jackie Gleason, and Piper Laurie, and dealt with
the life of a hustler in his world of pool halls, suckers, gambling,
and challenges.

Pool Halls

There exists three local arenas from which the pool en-
thusiast can choose for the scene of his endeavors. The most
popular one for the W&L student seems to be the Varsity
Billiard, owned by Pete Neofotis of College Inn fame and
operated by his son George. During an interview last weekend,
Pete said that business has increased 75 per cent since the
advent of The Hustler in Lexington.

Across and down Main Street a bit from the Varsity
lurks a competitor for the honor of appeasing the W&L
student pool player. This is the pool room attached to
Jordan’s Grill. A plack on this edifice testifies that it
was, in 1883, the Lexington Lodge for the Odd Fellows.
Today it is a combo Colored Tourist Information Cent-
er, grill, and pool hall. In the evenings we find many
of the more liberal student pool players partaking in the
sport at Clark’s.

The final emporium for pool resides on sedate Nelson
Street, next door to Buddy’s. It is known to the students as

 

__ Art Portnoy and Tony Schlesinger play at the Varsity
folk simply label it the Nelson Street Pool Hall. Here are
situated six active tables and a good deal of Hustler dirt,
dingyness and ‘atmosphere.’

Clark’s Pool Room

The Clark pool room set-up is probably the most like the
halls shown in the flick. Clark’s is complete with benches for
interested spectators and a Hustleresque picket type money
window.

I-M Pool

We feel that the renaissance of pool in Lexington warrants
some action which would incorporate the sport more into our
athletic program. Inter-collegiate pool is probably a bit in the
future, but it seems to us that intramural pool is certainly very
feasible. If ping-pong and bowling are part of the program,
why not pool?

The future might even bring pool into the P.E. courses.
The Physical Education department could follow the same
procedure as they do with bowling and golf. That is have
the local owners charge the students and, of course, the regular
50-50 split between the town merchant and the P.E. depart-
ment would continue with the pool hall owner.

Regardless of what comes of this pool activity, it has hit
Lexington now, and looks as if it might take another fiick to
dispel it. Let’s hope the next one isn’t skin diving!

Tigers Stomp Generals, 70-61

By HARRY MEEM
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s basketball
team started like a house afire Sat-
urday night, but wilted under steady
pressure to lose to Hampden-Sydney
Tigers, 70-61, here.

The Generals, thanks in large
part to the shooting of Bill Ide
and Tom Supak, held an 11-1
lead after five minutes of play,
pushed the lead up to 11 points,
16-5, before the Tigers started to
hit from the floor.

Tiger captain Norwood Davis,
sidelined when the Generals visited
Death Valley in January, account-
ed for ten points in a row for
Hampden-Sydney, bringing the
score from 18-11 to 23-21.

Tie Game

The Tigers tied the game at 29-
29 with 3:25 left in the half on a
jump shot by Phil Lotz. Tom Supak
sank a free throw to put the Gen-
erals aheal 30-29, then the Tigers’
Bill Hardin sank two free throws
with 40 seconds remaining to give
Hampden-Sydney a 31-30 lead at
the half.

The lead seesawed back and forth
for the first six minutes of the sec-
ond half as W&L captain Rodger
Fauber swapped shots with Hardin
and Davis. With 14 minutes left, the
Tigers’ Davis sank a free throw to
give Hampden-Sydney a 41-38 lead
which they never relinquished.

The Generals weren’t in the
game after the halfway point of
the period, as the Tigers at one
time held a 13-point lead on their
way to the 70-61 victory.

Scoring honors for the game went
to Bill Hardin of the Tigers, who
scored 22 points in the second half
after being held to four free throws
in the first 20 minutes. Hardin added
16 rebounds to his 26 points.

Right behind Hardin was Tiger
captain Norwood Davis, who hit on
five field goals and 15 of 17 free
throws for a total of 25 points. Lotz
also hit in double figures for the
visitors, with 12 points.

Fauber Top

The Generals finished with double
figures in the scoring column, Faub-
er with 18 points, Tom Supak with
16, and Ide with 12.

By DAVE MONTGOMERY

Washington and Lee’s matmen,
on the rebound from a 24-8 loss to
Norfolk William and Mary, handed
Duke a 19-8 defeat at Durham,
Saturday, to bring their overall sea-
son record to 5-2.

 

H-S Tomorrow

Tomorrow, the Generals visit
Hampden-Sydney College and then
entertain a perennially tough West
Virginia squad here Friday night at
7:30.

Against Duke, W&L rolled up a
19-8 score on a 5-4 decision by
Butch West; and 5-0 decision by
Tom Stover; a 6-1 win by newcomer
Pete Winfield ,a transfer from Okla-
homa; and a 5-3 win by Jud Bab-
cock. Herb Smith was held to a
tie giving the Generals two points,
and Sandy Mercereau gained the
only W&L pin. Charlie Dickinson,
substituting for Dave Montgomery,
who will return to the lineup to-
morrow against Hampden-Sydney,
turned in a highly creditable per-
formance in bowing 2-1, while Dick
Albert was edged on riding time,
4-3.

It appeared that the Generals had
their minds on exams January 20th
as they managed to salvage only

Some 250 varsity and freshman

begins at 2:30 Saturday afternoon.

Although VMI won last year’s
competition going away, William and
Mary and Virginia, second and third
place finishers a year ago, are ex-
pected to battle VMI for top hon-
ors.

Lord Speaks

W&L track coach Norm Lord
feels that this will be a good meet
even though the Generals won’t be
able to compete with the Big Five
schools.

He added that Jim Hickey, Rob-
in Kell and Skip Essex will bring
W&L points no matter who they
run or jump against and that the
rest of the team will give the re-
maining six schools a good scrap.

Participating for the Generals in
the dashes will be Hickey. Kell is
entered in the high jump and his
brother Chris, along with Fox Ur-
quhart will run in the middle dist-
ance races.

Mike Scoel is in the mile run and
Essex is scheduled in the middle
distance races. Jordan Smith and
Henry Sackett are broad-jumping
while Tom Edwards is in the hop,
step and jump event.

Frosh Entrants

Dave Killebrew, Ralph Gilliam,
Dave Myers and one other frosh will
run in the relay while Andy Kil-
patrick will enter the mile event.
The evening events start at 6:30 and
end with the mile relay at 9:30.

All students interested in trying

Fauber added 19 rebounds to his

to him for the Generals in this im-
portant department was Supak, with
8.

Out-Rebound

All told, the Tigers out-rebounded
the Generals, 62-44, outshot them
from the fioor, 36 per cent to 30 per
cent, and dominated the foul lines
with 30 of 37 attempts, compared
to W&L’s 9 out of 15.

Commenting on the game, General
coach Bob McHenry said, “We look-
ed bad on the boards and offensive-
ly.” As an example of how poor
W&L’s rebounding was, McHenry
cited the fact that Hampden-Syd-
ney’s Dave Tucker, a 5’ 6” guard,
got six rebounds, the same number
that the Generals’ three centers, Bill

 

Smith, Howard Martin, and Mike
Monier, got.

In all fairness to Monier, however,
it should be pointed out that he
hasn’t played basketball since the
1959-60 season, and was playing
Saturday night with a leg injury.

Bad on Offense

McHenry added that the Gener-
als were “standing still on offense,
moving very poorly on defense, and
fouling too much.”

Who played a good game? “I
couldn’t tell you anybody for us.
We just didn’t play basketball.”

We have, on more than one occasion,
pleaded with the fraternities to abolish the

I also want something done about it,
and I think I’ve come up with a

in an equal manner so as not to un-
justly differentiate between the ac-
tions of a fraternity and non-fra-
ternity student.

It would be hard indeed to justify
the restriction of a fraternity stu-
dent from his social privileges (were
he involved in a similar incident)
and then merely give the non-fra-
ternity student a severe verbal
warning. Thus, the committee took
the action it did by denying the non-
fraternity student any social pri-
viledges which, in the committee’s
estimation, would be formulated by
access to the town facilities.

It is my feeling that this letter
will clear up any questions concern-
ing the incident.

Atwood Named New

IFC Representative
(Continued from page 1)

Your services and counsel to all
members of this organization and
to individual fraternities have been
most valuable and sincerely appre-
ciated.

I certainly feel that the progress
made this year, particularly in the
areas of pledge-training and Help
Week, are in a large part due to
your counsel. As a token and re-
membrance of your services, the
# new revolving trophy given to the
fraternity with the most construc-
tive Help Week, will be named the
“Farrar Cup.”

In other IFC business last night,
the group voted for the final time on
the Help Week Proposals presented
several weeks ago. The vote was in
favor of adopting the proposals, thus
the proposals became a part of the IFC
Constitution.

The IFC voted also to work with
the University Dance Board for
Springs Dances. The group elected not
to have fraternities hold combo part-
ies during hours of entertainment on
the Campus.

This vote, it was noted, will not
place this action into the Constitution.
The vote on this issue will be effec-
tive only for the coming dance set.

HOW TO BE A BWOC

Ladies, let me be frank. The days of the college year dwindle
down to a precious few. And some of you—let’s face it—have
not yet become BWOC’s. Yes, I know, you’ve been busy what
with going to class and walking your cheetah, but really, ladies,
becoming a BWOC is so easy if you'll only follow a few simple
rules.

The first and most basic step on the road to being a BWOC
is to attract attention. Get yourself noticed. But be very, very
careful not to do it the wrong way. I mean, any old girl is
bound to be noticed if she goes around with a placard that says,
“HEY! LOOKIT ME!” Don’t you make such a horrid gaffe.
On your placard put: “ZUT! REGARDEZ MOT!” This, as
you can see, lends a whole new dimension of tone and dignity.

Once you have been noticed, it is no longer necessary to carry
the placard. It will suffice if, from time to time, you make
distinctive noises. If, for instance, every three or four minutes
you ery, “Whippoorwill!” you cannot but stay fresh in the
minds of onlookers.

We come now to clothes, a vital accessory to the BWOC—
indeed, to any girl who wishes to remain out of jail. But to the
BWOC clothes are more than just a decent cover; they are,
it is not too much to say, a way of life.

This spring the “little boy look” is all the rage on campus.
Every coed, in a mad effort to look like a little boy, is wearing
short pants, knee sox, and boyshirts. But the BWOC is doing
more. She has gone the whole hog in achieving little boyhood.
She has frogs in her pockets, scabs on her knees, down on her
upper lip, and is followed everywhere by a dog named Spot.

All this, of course, is only by day. When evening falls and her
date comes calling, the BWOC is the very picture of chie fem-
ininity. She dresses in severe, simple basic black, relieved only
by a fourteen pound charm bracelet. Her hair is exquisitely
coiffed, with a fresh rubber band around the pony tail. Her

daytime sneakers have been replaced by fashionable high
heeled pumps, and she does not remove them until she gets to
the movies,

After the movies, at the campus cafe, the BWOC undergoes
her severest test. The true BWOC will never, never, never, order
the entire menu. This is gluttony and ean only cause one’s date
to blanch. The true BWOC will pick six or seven good entrees
and then have nothing more till dessert. This is class and is
the hallmark of the true BWOC.,

Finally, the BWOC, upon being asked by the cigarette vendor
which is the brand of her choice, will always reply, “Marlboro,
of course!” For any girl knows that a Marlboro in one’s hand
stamps one instantly as a person of taste and discernment, as
the possessor of an educated palate, as a connoisseur of the finer,
loftier pleasures. This Marlboro, this badge of savoir-faire,
comes to you in flip-top boxes that flip, or in soft packs that are
soft, with a filter that filters and a flavor that is flavorful, in all
fifty states of the Union and Duluth.

too. Either place, you get a lot to like.

Fourteen W&L Professors
Get Glenn Grants For ’62

University funds totaling $5,205 have been granted to 14
Washington and Lee professors for support of reasearch and

study projects during 1962.

The awards, supported by the*
John M. Glenn Foundation at the
university, were announced today
by William W. Pusey, II. Individual
stipends this year range from $46
to $900.

The Glenn grants are part of a
Washington and Lee program de-
signed to promote continuing schol-
arship among faculty members and
increasing teaching effectiveness in
classrooms and laboratories.

Established in 1953, the program
is supported through a $120,000 gift
from the late philanthropist, John
M. Glenn. He was an official of the
Russell Sage Foundation and a
member of the class of 1879 at
Washington and Lee. Prior to the
Glenn program, a $25,000 grant from
the Carnegie Foundation was used
to promote faculty scholarship from
1951 to 1953.

Most of the faculty recipients will
conduct their research during this
summer’s vacation, but they have
until December 1 to complete their
work. The 1962 Grants so far:

Gore Speaks Out on Katangan,
Communist Influence in Congo

province apart from the other five
in the Congo, Gore replied that the
time has come for the province to
be reconciled with the central gov-
ernment, and that the recent agree-
ment of Katona, if kept, will ac-
complish the reconciliation.

Congo A National Unit

The Congo, he said, has been a
natural unit as a colony, and should
continue united as a nation. This
view is presently endorsed by the
Belgian, British, and United States
governments, as well as the UN.

Gore said that Congolese Prime
Minister Adoula, during a recent
Washington visit, stated two re-
quirements for the reconciliation of
Leopoldville with the secessionist
provinces: parliamentary negotiation
in the capitol, and a constitutional
arrangement.

The Senator said that he had
spoken to Adoula about using the
talents of Tshombe in the central
government, since leadership in the
Congra is at a premium; Adoula re-
plied that if Tshombe wanted it, he
could have a Federal cabinet posi-
tion.

The Present Chaos

To a question as to who stood to
gain from chaotic conditions in the
Congo, Gore answered that “Com-
munism thrives on chaos.” He said
that the Soviet Union would like to
see the United Nations fail in the
Congo.

In spite of Communist efforts,
Gore called the Congo “the only
major diplomatic victory we’ve won
in ten years.” He said the USS. is
“winning the fight for sub-Sahara
Africa. Why lose it now?”

The Senator emphatically stated
that Communist leadership in the
Congo is exaggerated. Africans as a
rule, he said, do not have sufficient
sophistication for ideological devo-
tion to Communism.

To back up this opinion, Gore rea-
soned that African tribal ties are
much stronger thatn the abstract
appeal of ideology. The tribal or-
ganization, he said, is essentially
democratic and acts as an impedi-
ment to Communism. Gore ex-
plained that in Africa the Com-
munists have sought domination
through selected leaders, not
through conversion of the masses.
However, he said, the “extremely
small minority” of educated Com-
munists which is the Soviet hope,
is almost non-existant.

U.S. vs. U.S.S.R.

Asked whether he thought the
U.S. were equipped to handle Rus-
sia, Gore replied: “I think we're
the strongest military power in the
world.” He described U.S. military
might as just “coming to fruition”
since the disarmament after World
War II. He pointed to US. strength
in missile subs.

After the conference cheerful
Gore summarized his hopes for the
U.N. in the Congo: “The UN and the
U.S. standing together can bring
effective self-government to the
Congo, as well as hold off any for-
eign threat.”

Senator Gore was the principal
speaker in W&L’s eighth annual In-
ternational Relations Week. He
called the UN action in the Congo
greatest defeat that Khrush-
chev has suffered in a decade.”

Stephen W. Rutledge is already a
member of the Society, having been
elected in his junior year.

 

Honor Society

Beta Gamma Sigma is an honor
society which recognizes outstand-
ing achievement by students of
business administration. Its chapters
are placed only in colleges and uni-
versities accredited by the American
Association of Collegiate Schools of
Business. The Society was founded
in 1913 and Beta of Virginia Chapter
was installed at Washington and Lee
in 1933. New members are elected
from senior candidates for degrees
in commerce and _ administration,
with no more than ten per cent of
such seniors eligible for election. In
exceptional cases a man may
elected in his junior year.

former secretary to a
member of the Indian parliament,
credited UN effectiveness to the late
Dag Hammerskjold and to the evo-
lution of the UN Secretariat into an
executive arm.

The USSR, said Nawaz, has
“abused the veto power” in the UN
Security Council in order “to re-
duce the effectiveness of the Unit-
ed Nations to solve world prob-
lems.” But the Soviets have not
proved capable of stopping UN op-
erations to date, he said.

Although the Security Council is
crippled by the Soviet veto, Nawaz
said, the General Assembly has been
able to act separately. The newly-
developed executive power of the
Secretariat he called a Soviet de-
feat.

The UN in the Congo

The Indian said that “Congo op-
erations proved” that the Secretary-
General is not merely an adminis-
trator. In an obvious reference to
the USSR, he said the success of the
Secretary-General’s actions “irritat-
ed at least one power” to the point
of trying to “remove him.”

Though Nawaz favored executive
power for the UN, he said that the
acknowledgement of the Secretary-
General as a chief executive “would
prove a costly mistake,” the Sec-
retary-General must remain in the
capacity of an “executive function-
ary.” Thus will the UN be able to
exercise “its primary function,” to
“maintain world peace.”

Nawaz said that the United States
has the “major responsibility for
sharing the fate” of the UN. The
sacrifices which must be made “for
the cause of the UN” are not big in
terms of money, he said; Ameri-
cans must not feel that they are
paying too much. He called the UN
bond issue “a compliment to your
charitable dispositions.”

Not a World Government

The UN, said Nawaz, is not a
world government; rather, it merely
provides “a frame of reference” for
the settlement of international prob-
lems. In this capacity, he called the
organization a success.

He said the major obstacles to con-
tinued progress for the UN are the
Security Council veto power and the
“frame of mind” of people today.
Saying that the UN is “a new hu-
man experiment,” he asked for “a
bold frame of mind” in dealing with
it. He said that men must think not
merely of objectives or of dangers
in the processes of the UN; they
must “realize that humanity has
come to the point of organizing a
world community.”

The Goa Question

 

In a questioning period after his
speech, Nawaz answered querries
both on the UN and on his native
country. The first question was “Did
India act in accordance with UN
principles in seizing Goa?” Nawaz
admitted that India “abdicated its
own policy” to the extent of using
foree when it took Goa. But he
asked the audience to consider that
the dispute had reached a point at
which it would respond to nothing
except force.

Proposed Debate
Befuddles NSA

The team of Uncas Mc-
Thenia and Craig Distlehorst won
its third debate—all by default
Tuesday afternoon. For the third
time their debate against regional
and national National Student As-
sociation officers was canceled be-
fore starting time.

Scheduled for over a month, the
debate has been planned to set Mc-
Thenia and Distlehorst as attackers
of the NSA, with regional and na-
tional officers of the organization
defending it. It was to have taken
place at both Sweet Briar

Facing The Facts

Realizing that we are putting ourselves in a precarious po-
sition, we would like to comment on the proposed amendment
to the Student Body Constitution which would eliminate the
representative of the Publications Board from the executive
committee.

Those who argue for the elimination of the Publications
Board representative claim that the position is not an elected
one, and that the presence of a non-elected member on the EC
is a violation of the democratic principles on which the W&L
student government is based. The Publications Board commit-
teeman, they say, does not represent a significant portion of
the student body, and therefore should not be allowed a place
in student government.

We feel, however, that those who form their arguments
solely on the basis of democratic principles are laboring under
an illusion. Washington & Lee is not a model democratic com-
munity, and never will be. Those who hope for year-round
student body interest in student government are simply not
facing the facts. Our student government depends almost en-
tirely on the integrity of the members of the Executive Com-
mittee, and not on student participation.

The representative from the Publications Board is almost
inevitably an individual of integrity and talent. He has shown
interest, ability, and responsibility to be chosen to edit one of
the school publications. He is necessarily abreast of student af-
fairs. We think it would be sheer folly to deny such a person
an important place in student government.

The Student Control Committee

Howard Slater in his column today makes a plea for a posi-

tive ideal of gentlemanly conduct. He hopes that the Student
Control Committee will play an important role in the move
away from what Mr. Slater believes to be the present negative
nature of student discipline.
, Weare all for a positive concept of conduct and we hope that
the Student Control Committee will foster such an ideal. One
of the major ways it can do so is by arousing student concern
for the amount of ungentlemanly behavior that goes on here.
If the flurry of letters-to-the-editor and comments that have
greeted the Control Committee’s first actions is an indication
of aroused interest, the Committee is already well on its way to
a positive goal.

The Basketball Controversy

Tuesday columnist Thorns Craven joined our sports
editor, Steve Henry, this week as charter members of the
Washington and Lee Athletic Supporters Club.Belying its
name, but acting like the usual boosters club, these two worth-
ies find very little to support in our present basketball team.
Indeed, the performances of the team have been horrendous
at times this year.

Their criticisms have, however, drawn some rather sharp
comments from the team’s members and supporters. We’re
afraid we don’t know enough about the game to discuss the
technical aspects of the various attacks and counterattacks in-
telligently, but we are very interested in certain questions of
school spirit and athletic policy that have been implicit in the
controversy.

People who say that the criticisms may be true but should
never have been uttered are wrong in one respect and right in
another.

They are right in contending that our non-subsidized athlet-
ic policy is here to provide recreation and not entertainment
for the student body. (Most students have expressed their
opinion of the entertainment value of basketball here by stay-
ing away from the games.) Anyone who thinks that he should
be provided a Saturday night spectacle, courtesy of the athletic
department, should have gone to Duke. They’ll never get it
here. The defenders of the team are further correct in saying
to the critics ‘Well, why don’t you get out there and do bet-
ter?” Everyone at Washington and Lee has an opportunity to
make a varsity team, if they want to badly enough. There are
no paid gladiators here to take the spot that should be theirs.

The defenders are wrong, however, in implying that no
one has a right to criticize the team. We think that it is the re-
sponsibility of the student newspaper to tell what is going on
at W&L. This involves answering the big question in all sports
reporting—Just how good are they? Too many athletes are
their own psychoanalysts,, deciding what is good and bad for
their “mental attitude.” In truth, no athlete has any answer
for his critics but to prove in competition that he is better than
they said he was.

The basketball team under Coach McHenry (whom we
believe to be both a gentleman and a fine coach) , despite some
grumbling, seem to have tried very hard this year. We still en-
joy watching them play and feel that more people would en-
joy their games than now attend them. They have our every
best wish for better performances in the future. But despite
our opinions as editors we see no reason why the criticism
should be called off. We find it on the whole to be a healthy
sign of student concern for our intercollegiate teams. Some
people here care very much whether “we” win or lose.

An Interview With President Cole...

 

Washington & Lee’s Position

On Federal Aid To Education

By TRACY HARRINGTON

“Healthy” was the term Univer-
sity President Dr. Fred C. Cole used
to describe Washington and Lee’s
financial independence from the
government,

Discussing the over-all policy of
the school concerning federal aid
to education, President Cole said
that the policy of the board of trus-
tees indicates that they will not ac-
cept general federal aid.

Declaring that “Washington and
Lee is better off” financially than
many schools, President Cole said,
“We have opportunities here for
getting most of what we need.”

He feels that schools that can
function adequately without the use
of federal funds should do so. How-
ever, he added that some schools
cannot do what they are called on
to do without outside financial help.

“If we find ourselves unable to
provide the students with what they
need here, then we might be impel-
led to participate in some of the
government’s programs,” he said.

Before coming to Washington and
Lee, President Cole was affiliated
with Tulane University in New Or-
leans, La. Tulane does accept sub-

 

stantial government funds. Does
Dr. Cole feel that that university
has been hurt by federal assistance?
“No,” he said. “Of course, I can-
not say that it will or will not affect
Tulane adversely in the future. Tu-
lane had no choice, however, if it
was to serve the region as it should.
Private support was inadequate.”

What are some of the possible ill
effects of federal aid?

According to Dr. Cole, the same
two dangers that have always been
associated with a paternalistic gov-
ernment prevail in the aid-to-edu-
cation problem. He cited the possi-
bility of limiting controls being ex-
ercised by the government, and he
said that with federal support a
school “may tend to rely more on
the government than on itself.”

While Washington and Lee con-
tinues to maintain its independence
financially, both scholarship and
loan programs to students are be-
ing expanded. New buildings are
being added, and other improve-
ments obviously requiring substan-
tial money are being instituted in
the school. Last year the Ring-tum
Phi said one in five students at
Washington and Lee received finan-

cial aid. As signs of physical ex-
pansion, we see the new dormitories
and the science buildings being
constructed. Where does the money
for these programs come from?

Primarily, Washingtgon and Lee’s
financial support comes from five
areas: endowment funds, grants from
foundations, business, and friends of
the University, student tuition fees,
an alumni fund, and a parents’ fund.
These sources seem to promise for
the future adequate maintenance of
the university as a high calibre in-
stitution.

We are doing all right without
general federal support, and except
for some specialized research and
training done in the national inter-
est, the board of trustees wants to
keep it that way.

“Washington and Lee is fortun-
ate,” President Cole said. “We are
getting along without federal sub-
sidy, and if we could do without it
forever, I think it would be good.”

The highly valued freedom of this
university as manifested in its non-
affiliation with any particular re-
ligious or social group, is further in
the board’s policy on governmental
financial aid.

 

 

By HOWARD SLATER

The bulletin board outside Payne
Hall is never so carefully reviewed
as when incidents of misconduct and
the consequent punishments have
been announced. The popularity, so
to speak, with which these an-
nouncements are received, attest to
the fact that these are situations
which mean a great deal to most of
the student body.

It is not difficult to understand
why this should be so. The reac-
tions of most students to these no-
tices indicate that they realize that
it might easily have been their fate
to suffer one of the forms of pun-
ishment which have been devised to
keep the course of gentlemanly con-
duct on an even keel. A number of
students, I suspect, must sometimes
start with guilty recognition at the
identification of the incident in
question with some act that they
themselves had done in the past.
Clearly, all of us realize that we are
potentially capable of committing
the very same transgressions which
are being punished.

A Policy of Deterrence

This latent capability for un-
gentlemanly conduct is the basic
reason why these notices are made
public. The reaction—“that could
have been me’’—is precisely the ef-
fect which was intended. It is a
policy of deterrence and, as the
word implies, is based on fear.

How can we then accept such a
policy after it is stated so bluntly
in these terms? How can we then
continue to guide our social behav-
ior in terms of “getting away with
what can be gotten away with?”
This is, after all, the true general
nature of our social relation to the
faculty (although there are un-
doubtedly individual exceptions),
and it is the true nature of our con-
cept of a personal social ideal. The
sudent body-faculty relationship is,
in general, based on fear; and the
student’s personal code of social val-
ues is based on his knowledge of
what he can get away with.

The important influence, however,
is the first—the engendering of fear.
But it is foolish to think that the
faculty really wants to pursue a
policy of deterrence. It is equally as
foolish to believe that a new Dean
of Students relishes his first oppor-
tunity to punish students, in order
to establish fear of his authority as
quickly as possible. These are nega-
tive approaches to a problem, and
negativism can only harvest a bitter
crop.

That is why the newly-formed
Student Control Committee is so
important. It represents a positive
approach to the problem of gentle-
manly conduct. And make no mis-
take about the importance of such an
ideal. It is justifiable to scoff when
conduct means no more than man-
ners, as it does to many. But con-
duct can and should express the
inner man, and what his true social
beliefs are.

The Control Committee

The Control Committee is poten-
tially in a position where it can do
much to really instill such an ideal.
The Dean and the Administrative

 

Committee of the faculty seem gen-

 

uinely concerned with promoting
the Control Committee and _ its
work. And the student body is po-
tentially in a position to profit
thereby.

But the Student Control Commit-
tee, in order to realize this potential
for good, cannot resort to the wrist-
slapping methods which the faculty
has found so distasteful. Let it rath-
er promote a viable and vital faith
in gentlemanly conduct as an out-
ward manifestation of a worthwhile
individual. Let us have an end to
notices and nervous reactions, an

Faculty-Student Relations Based On Fear;
Student Control Committee Is Positive Step

end to deterrents, an end to fear,
an end to negativism. Let us have
this student committee and the stu-
dent body make a positive effort to
make a positive peace with a posi-
tive ideal of social behavior.

And let us have the faculty give
the committee and the student body
the opportunity to do it. The al-
ternatives for everyone are clear.
But we have accepted the building
of better men, rather than keeping
men in line, as the purpose of this
university, then there is no alterna-

 

tive at all.

The Adventures
Of Mildew
On the SCCWS

By STEVE HENRY
Dear Mother and Daddy,

I thought I would write and tell
you about another great honor that
just came my way up here at school.
What it is is this—I got named to
the Student Censorship Committee
for Wayward Students (SCCWS),
and I’m real happy about it because
it shows how much faith some peo-
ple have in my ability to make re-
sponsible decisions.

What we do on the committee is
decide what punishment should be
given to students who don’t con-
duct themselves as gentlemen. You
know how important it is up here
for a person to conduct himself in
a gentlemanly manner, and I hope
you also see how important our
committee is. It’s like one guy on
the committee said, “We sure are
important.”

The faculty used to have a com-
mittee that did the same thing we
do, but they turned all the respon-
sibility over to the students. That’s
one good thing about this school: it
recognized that students are capa-
ble of making decisions that most
colleges leave to adults. Of course,
there was some talk about how we
would probably be too lenient on
our fellow students, and I’ve got to
admit that it looks like we might be
partial toward our friends, but, let
me tell you, that’s not the case. We
are trying our hardest to live up to
the trust that the faculty had in us,
and show everybody that we mean
business when we say we’re going to
maintain this school’s gentlemanly
reputation, which has always been
the very essence (and I hope always
will be) of our school.

Just to give you an example of
how we’re trying on this committee,
I thought I would tell you about a
few of the cases that have already
come up before us, and how we
acted on the cases. I guess the first
important one happened last week
when a member of the student body
belched in a local restaurant. Of
course, there’s nothing more dis-
gusting than that, and certainly
nothing more ungentlemanly, so we
confined him to his room in the
dormitory for the rest of the semes-
ter.

You might think this was too len-
ient a punishment for such a hein-
ous offense, but we had a plan be-
hind it. You see, he hasn’t got any
cuts, and, if he can’t leave his room,
he’ll never to able to go to class,
and naturally will fail out of school.
We just can’t have undesirable peo-
ple around this school. No sir!

Another interesting case happened
when we caught a member of the
student body making out with a girl
in public. They were in the basement
of a fraternity house during a party
week-end, and were actually kissing
right in front of everyone in the
room. Now you know as well as I
do that people just don’t do things
like that. Obviously the boy is ab-
normal, doing that in public with
at least five people in the same
room. We put him on social proba-
tion for the next three years. This
means that he can’t have a date,
can’t go around his fraternity house,
can’t leave campus except on a
school-sponsored trip, and has to
sign out of the dorm at night when
he goes to the library. We’re trying
to get the girl kicked out of her
school, but I’m afraid the authori-
ties there aren’t aware of the grav-
ity of the situation.

And then there was the case of
the boy who went over to a neigh-
boring college, and called up his girl
on the phone. The trouble was that
he called after 10:30 p.m., which is
the latest anyone from our school
can use the phone anywhere. There
was nothing we could do when we
found out about it (one of his
friends turned him in—the honor
system REALLY works, you know)
except recommend to the faculty
that he be kicked out of school. A
gentleman just keeps off the phone
after 10:30. That’s all there is to it.
Like I said earlier, you’ve got to
be tough or people will walk all
over you, and that’s why we're try-
ing to run the SCCWS as tough as
we possibly can.

Let me tell you, it’s a thankless
job. You’d be surprised how many
people are critical of us, just be-
cause we saw our duty and did it
in these cases. I think it’s just an-
other example of how mixed up
morals of students at this school
are,

I really haven’t got much time
before dinner, so I guess I better
end this letter. I just wanted you to
know that I’m doing something
worthwhile up here, and not just
goofing off. Thank you for the val-
entine, and I'll write again soon.

Your loving son,
Mildew

Action in I-M Basketball Playoffs.

 

SAE Moves Toward
I-M Basketball Title

SAE took a giant step toward the intra-mural basketball
championship last night when it handed the Delts a 51-37 de-

feart in Dormus Gymnasium.

Led by Henry Sackett’s game-*
high 24 points, the SAE’s recovered
from an early 13-6 deficit, and came
on to win going away.

The SAE’s, now 2-0 in play-off
competition, moved past the Kappa
Sig’s in the first round, 66-37. Phil
Sharpe contributed 28 points for the
winners; Lance Tarrance got 13 for
the losers.

In other first round action, the
Delts defeated the Sigma Chi’s
55-14.

Chi’s Out

Sigma Chi, which won its league
in a post-season play-off against the
KA’s was eliminated from the
championship Thursday night by the
Kappa Sig’s.

Trailing by three points with less
than a minute to go, the Sig’s turned
a stolen pass into one basket, then
scored the winning point on a short
jump shot by Tarrance with only
seconds left on the clock.

Both the Kappa Sig’s and Delts
are 1-1 in the double-elimination
tournament.

They play Monday night, and the
winner will meet the SAE’s to de-
termine the school champion.

To win, however, the winner of
the Delt-Kappa Sig game, will have
to defeat the SAE’s twice, while one

Pitt Tonight

By ED NORTON

Washington and Lee’s swimming
team takes on a strong University of
Pittsburgh team tonight in the
Doremus gym pool at 8 p.m. Coach
Norris Eastman says that Pitt has
some top swimmers but W&lL’s
depth should make it a close meet.

The varsity swimmers went down
to their first defeat of the season on
Monday, losing to a powerful Univ-
ersity of Maryland 61-24. Until the
loss at College Park, only a tie with
William and Mary had marred the
team’s record.

Maynard, Relay Team Win

Maryland captured firsts in all but
two of the eleven events. The 400
yard freestyle relay team and cap-
tain Elliott Maynard in the 200 yard
breaststroke were the lone winners
for Washington and Lee. Coach
Norris Eastman singled out Herb
Jahncke, John Wolfe, and Maynard
as the outstanding performers for
the losers.

Washington and Lee returned to
winning track quickly, swamping
Catholic University of Washington,
D.C. 70-25 on Tuesday. The tank-
men took first place in all events
except the 200 yard backstroke and
the 200 yard butterfly. Freshman
John Woolf again broke his school
record in the 440 yard free style
with a time of 5:13.4. Eastman was
particularly encouraged by the out-
standing performance of three other
freshmen. David Geer in the 160
yard individual medly, Skip Chase
in the 50 yard free style, and Rigly
Grant in the 100 yard free style all
won their respective events.

The team’s record now stands at
7-1-1 with one meet remaining after
Pitt.

Next Friday, the tankmen meet
East Carolina, here. Coach Eastman
pointed out that East Carolina de-
feated Norfolk division of William
and Mary by almost exactly the
same score as Washington and Lee.

The Generals are 6-2 for the year,
but the West Virginia match is the
toughest in their ten match schedule.

Miller will go with his usual start-
ing line-up, which means Butch
West, Dave Montgomery, Tom
Stover, Pete Winfield, Sandy Mer-
sereau, Dick Albert, Herb Smith,
and either Bob Pagano or Jud Bab-
cock.

In the West Virginia match, Al-
bert, Smith, and Pagano or Babcock
will be facing their toughest match-
es of the year according to Miller.

He called West Virginia “excep-
tionally good” in the top three or
four weight divisions.

Praise

Miller called his 1961-62 squad the
“best balanced and fastest” team in
his ten years of coaching at W&L.

“We're not particularly big in size
this year,’ he said. “But our boys
have kept on the offensive and have
been one step ahead of the oppon-
ent most of the time.”

“We'll have to keep it up against
West Virginia of we're going to win.
A little luck might help out, too,”
he added.

Miller singled out freshman Pete
Winfield and Butch West for indi-
vidual praise.

West, wrestling in the 112-pound
class, has compiled a 6-2 record for
the year.

Winfield, who’s appeared in only
two matches this year, has won both
decisively. Miller said, “Winfield
might make the difference against
West Virginia.”

Fauber, Thackston Lead |

Generals Past Maroons

By LANCE TARRANCE
Washington and Lee’s basketball Generals jumped into an
early 14-point lead, then held off hot-shooting Roanoke Col-
lege for a 77-75 win here Wednesday.

The W&L victory ended a

three game Maroon winning

streak, and lifted the Generals’ season record to 5-7.

With Bip Fauber, Tom Supak and*
Brett Thackson leading the way, the
Generals surged into a 38-22 lead
after 14 minutes of the first half.

Comeback

Then Roanoke guard Rod Ely led
the Maroons in a comeback that cut
W&L’s lead to seven points, and it
was 40-33 at halftime.

The Generals hit at a 42.5 per cent
clip from the floor during the first
half, with Fauber scoring 15 points,
which included six straight field
goals, five of them coming on long
jumpers from outside the key.

Despite some of the finest outside
shooting displayed in Dormeus Gym
this year, the Maroons never came
closer in the second half than the
final two-point margin.

Ely, leading the Roanoke fast
break, set up forward Morris Creg-
ger for six straight baskets of his
own, all coming on jump shots from
the corner.

Thackston Hot

But Brett Thackston, seeing con-
siderable action for the first time
this year, came up with six straight,
too, and when Thackston couldn’t
get open for a shot, Tom Supak
slipped through for repeated lay-ups
and short jumpers to uphold the
Generals’ lead.

Fauber had 25 for W&L, which
put four men in double figures. Su-

 

 

pak had 18, Thackston 14, and guard
Louie Paterno 12.

Ely, with 24, Cregger, with 18, and
Steve Baker, with 16, led the Ma-
roons.

As usual, Fauber led both teams
in rebounding, picking up 14. Supak
got eight, and Paterno got six.

The Generals were cold from the
free throw line, making only nine of
19 there. Roanoke hit 15 for 24 at the
line.

Hot Shooting

But the Generals made up for it
with a 48 percent overall shooting
average, good enough to win in al-
most any league.

Washington and Lee’s next ac-
tion is against Catholic University
tonight. Saturday, the Generals meet
Washington University.

NSA Debate Postponed

(Continued from page 1)
was stepping into a car for the drive
over. Each time they have pleaded
a lack of cooperation from their na-
tional officers.

Distlehorst, commenting on the
“disorganization in the organization,”
said that the two national vice-
presidents have been ordered to re~-
port for their army physicals, and
that the NSA agent who is a Peace
Corps recruiting officer was some-
how drafted. This may provide an
explanation of the situation.

Distlehorst also suggested the
possibility that the mere scheduling
of a debate against himself and Mc-
Thenia had effected a change of
sides among the NSA adherents, and
that NSA is on the way out of
neighboring schools.

Wrestlers Meet W. Va.

Washington and Lee’s wrestling
team traveled to Hampden-Sydney
Wednesday and made the Tigers
wish they hadn’t shown.

The Generals won handily, 33-5,
registering five pins en route to
victory.

Scoring wins on pins were Butch
West in 8:06, Tom Stover in 2:49,
Sandy Mersereau in 4:20, and Herb
Smith in 1:53.

Dick Albert won by forfeit, and
Dave Montgomery, making his first
start since a leg injury during Fancy
Dress, won by a 7-1 decision.

Freshman Garrett Kratzig, who
made his first varsity appearance
against H-S, was pinned in the last
period for the Tigers’ only victory,
but W&L coach Dick Miller said
that Kratzig did “an outstanding
job,” especially since this is his first
year as a wrestler.

The win brought the Generals’
season record to 6-2.

‘Othello’ Scheduled For

Troubadour Production

“Othello,” now in rehearsal at the
Troubadour Theatre, is scheduled to
be one of the largest productions
ever held by the Troub players.

More than 25 persons will take
part in the play which will run
March 14-17.

Bob Allen, senior from Park Hills,
Ky., will be appearing as Othello.

Allen, who is a fine arts major,
appeared last year in the title role
of the highly acclaimed “Henry IV.”
He has taken part in numerous other
Troubadour productions, among
them Christopher Fry’s “The Lady
Is Not for Burning.”

John Dunnell, president of the
Troubadours, will portray Iago.

Dunnell, a junior from New York,
is a veteran of Troub productions,
having appeared in every show
done at Washington and Lee since
he came here.

Appearing as Roderigo will be Tim
Morton, a junior from Roanoke.
Morton appeared last season in all
three Troub shows. His last role
was that of Napoleon in Bernard
Shaw’s “Man of Destiny.”

Sophomore Steve Colvin, making a
second appearance at thetheatre,
will be seen as Cassio. He appeared
this past fall in “Boy Meets Girl.”

The leading feminine role of Des-

demona will be done by Lisa Tracy,
a student at Lexington High School.
Miss Tracy is a veteran of several
Troub productions, although this is
the first time she has appeared in
a role of this scope.

The part of Emilia will be por-
trayed by Josephine Unger, a facul-
ty member of Southern Seminary.
She first appeared her last year in
“Man of Destiny.”

Major supporting roles are held by
Andy Leonard, appearing as Lodo-
vico; Terry Van Brunt as Montano,
Gay Reading as Gratiano, Andy
Adelson as the Duke of Venice, and
Deborah Johnson as Bianca.

Curtain time for each performance
is to be at 8:15 pm. The play is
under the direction of Dr. Cecil
Jones.

» Pi Kappa Phi had a 1.471 rating
for fifth place.

The all men’s average for first
semester was 1.392, as opposed to
1,387 for the second semester of
last year.

The list reveals that only six
fraternities were above the all
men’s average, and that the non-
fraternity men were also above
the all men’s average with a 1.465
rating.

Twelve fraternities fell below the
all men’s average.

Phi Delta Theta finished last on
the list with a 1.217 average.

Last year PEP finished first for
both semesters. The second semes-
ter of last year saw that fraternity
total a 2.060 average.

ZBT finished second with a 1.643
average for first semester last year,
and Lambda Chi Alpha took sec-
ond place for the second semester
with a 1.768.

The all men’s average this semes-
ter rose by .005 over second semes-
ter last year, and by .076 over the
first semester figure.

The number of fraternities above
the all men’s average is the same as
the last semester of 1960-61 when
six houses were above the 1.387 all
men’s mark.

For the first semester of 1960-61
seven houses were above the all
men’s average of 1.316.

The only change in the houses
above the all men’s average is Kap-
pa Sigma which rose from 12th at
second semester last year to sixth
this year.

 

 

| IFC Creates Group To Study Rush

A petition already signed by 20 members of the Washington and Lee faculty which would
have rush week moved to the first week of the sophomore year was read by Dean E. C. At-
wood at last night’s IFC meeting.

The petition, Dean Atwood explained, did not represent the entire faculty, but it repre-
sents a sizeable segment of that body.

The article was distributed to different faculty members a few days ago, and the petition
is expected to get nearly 50 per cent of the faculty’s names signed to it before circulation

of it is completed.

“We, the undersigned,” the petition states, “request that the administration study the
advisibility of deferring rushing and pledging in the social fraternities until the week preced-
ing the opening of school in the sophomore year and initiation until a time preceding the start

of the second semester.”

 

Glenn Returns
After 5 Hours
In Outer Space

From the Associated Press Wire

The lift-off of the Atlas
rocket signaled the end of a
series of delays and launched
this country on another step in
efforts to catch up with Russia
in the race into space. The
rocket hurled the spacecraft—
called “Friendship Seven” af-
ter the seven astronauts—into
an egg-shaped orbit, ranging
from 100 to 160 miles high,
at a speed of around 17,500

miles an hour.

The 40-year old Marine Lieuten-
ant Colonel—describing a panoramic
view of the earth—called it a tre-
mendous and beautiful sight. The
astronaut ate a meal of beef and
vegetagles through a squeeze bot-
tle. And he is controlling the atti-
tude of his capsule and making in-
strument readings to tracking sta-
tions.

The hearts of Americans and for-
eigners traveled with Glenn as he
circled around and around the globe.

Passing over Australia, he sighted
the lights of the city of Perth. Near-
ly all lights in the city had been
turned on by residents as a good-
will gesture toward the space pi-
oneer. Glenn told an astronaut mon-
itoring the flight: “Thank everybody
for turning them on.”

Glenn said he felt real good as he
made the second pass over Cape
Canaveral. He made the the report
to another pioneer astronaut Alan
Shepherd.

The advantages of such a system, if adopted, are listed in

cademic loss of the first week

of the second semester of the freshman year.

3. It would allow time for a

proper evaluation by both fra-

ternities and prospective members.

4. It would strengthen class ties*
and develop a sense of pride in the
University.

5. It would eliminate the stigma
sometimes attached to non-fraterni-
ty students.

“We request that a report of this
study be given at a regular meeting
of the faculty in the near future,”
the petition states.

Atwood Explains

Dean Atwood explained to the
IFC that the petition has not yet
been officially received by the Ad-
ministration, and that the procedure
for handling it have not yet been
fully determined.

Atwood expressed the view that
an IFC study on possible revisions
in the rush system would be helpful
at this time.

He further added that the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities would
have to be brought into the picture
before the petition was directed to
the Administration.

Dean Atwood left the IFC meet-
ing early last night to attend a
session with the Executive Com-
mittee. He told the Ring-tum Phi
this morning that the petition was
also discussed at the EC meeting.

IFC Sets Up Committee

The IFC elected to set up a com-
mittee to study possible revisions
and IFC President Bob Doenges said
that a chairman would be named
within the next few days.

It was pointed out in the IFC

meeting that a study was conducted
two years ago on possible rush re-

 

 

visions, but that any change was
voted down at that time.

“Will Close Six Houses”

In speaking about the new pro-
posed system brought forward by
the petition, Doenges said that he
expected that at least six of the
fraternities would be forced to close
if such a system involving sophomore
rush were started.

He clarified this statement by say-
ing that the new system would in-
volve a year’s operation without a
freshman class, an element necessary
to financing the fraternities.

Strongly Opposes System

Discussion among IFC members
indicated that the IFC, as a whole,
strongly opposed the system.

It is expected that W&L’s rushing
system will be discussed at tonight's
Faculty Discussion Group.

In other IFC business, the group
passed the Help Week proposals for
the last time, thereby placing the
proposals in the IFC Constitution.

The IFC voted also to continue
the same foreign student plan for
this semester.

It was reported that $54.00 was
collected during Help Week for the
March of Dimes Campaign by five
fraternities.

Finally, the “Wheels for Johnson”
campaign was brought back to the
IFC. A report was made that showed
the electrical cart given the fresh-
man dorm janitor three years ago
needs repairs. The IFC voted to

Student Leaders Favor New Constitution

By KEN LANE
Associate Editor

The Executive Committee is cur-
rently considering two important
proposals for changes in the Student
Body Constitution.

The first of these provides for a
new voting system whereby candi-
dacy for office will
be based simply
upon a petition of
fifty students.

The second
measure provides
for the elimina-
tion of the Pub-
lications Board
representative to
the EC along with
one of the Senior
Class representa-
tives, and the es-
two members-at-

tablishment
large.

of

In a series of interviews, this re-
porter has tried to determine the
relative support for the proposals
and what significance, of any, they
are expected to bear if they are
passed.

Uncas McThenia, president of the
student body, said that one of the

 

Ww

All Approve Elimination Of Nomination Convention

important changes which the new
proposed voting system will bring
about is the abolition of the
“cumbersome machinery of nomi-
nating conventions.”

He added that “it will further-
more afford minority groups the
opportunity to run candidates.

“Under the present system, only
two candidates can run for an
office. If the new measure is passed,
this restriction will be done away
with.”

Meade Christian, junior class rep-
resentative to the EC, stated that
the proposed voting system would
not break down the two big party
cliques, but would serve, in theory
at least, to open up the candidacy
to any and all who are qualified.

Like McThenia, Christian believes
that a major benefit from the change
would be the elimination of the
nominating convention.

“In past years,” he commented, “it
has been a mere farce—just a rubber
stamp for the two party nominees.”

Christian further approves the

Ww Ww

elimination of the Publications rep-
resentative.

“All representatives,” he stated,
“should be elected without exception
by popular vote.”

Howard Slater, chairman of the
Independent Party, felt that the
proposed voting system would only
serve to strengthen the two party
cliques.

“The parties would realize that
they could never get a man into
office unless the houses stick together
in their respective parties. Other-
wise, it would be a matter of indi-
vidual houses competing against
each other,” Slater remarked.

Commenting on the elimination of
the Publications Board representa-
tive, Slater stated that having one
of the newspaper editors on the
EC results in the editorials having a
slanted view.

“The Ring-tum Phi is continually
praising the EC without presenting
any other perspective to the Com-
mittee,” Slater added.

Rosie Page, a senior class repre-

 

 

Ww Ww

sentative and a former Ring-tum Phi
editor, considers that to eliminate
the Publications representative
would be a bad mistake.

“In the four years I have been
here, this representative has con-
sistently been one of the most ef-
fective members of the Committee,
Page commented.

Page further objected to the elim-
ination of one of the two senior class
representatives.

“The two members-at-large,” he
said, “would result in too much
flexibility and would not guarantee
proportional representation.”

Steve Suttle, secretary of the
student body, favors the new pro-
posal of candidacy by petition not
for any effect it may have on the
party cliques, but because it would
cut out the “sterile” nominating
convention.

Secondly, he added that “it would
offer all groups and in particular
the non-fraternity group, a chance
to run a man for office.”

Suttle supports the elimination of}

 

Ww

the Publications Board representa-
tive and states that he can see no
reason why “a more distributed
representation does not exist here as
it does with the other eleven mem-
bers.”

Rick Frisbie, president of the
Kappa Sig house, stated that the
need for change in our voting sys-
tem does exist and our present two-
party organization is not necessarily
getting the best man elected.

Frisbie, however, does not feel
that the present voting proposals
will effect the needed changes.

He advocates, rather a system like
that at UVa., where voting is done
on an individual basis and each
house sends delegates to the nomi-
nating poles in the same way that
states do in electorial colleges.

Ray Robrecht, vice-president of
the student body, sees that the new
voting system would not change
the dual party structure, but on the
other hand it is unfair for the Con-
stitution to overlook the minority
groups.

 

“We should not restrict elections
to just two candidates per office,”
Robrecht stated, “but rather give
anyone who wants the chance to
attain nomination.”

Robrecht, speaking in regard to
the Publications representative, feels
that a Ring-tum Phi editor should
not be on the EC.

“It is not effective journalism for
one thing,” he stated.

Bill Lowry, editor of Protest
agrees with the above that the new
proposals for voting would not have
been any considerable effect upon
the party system, but does open up
possibilities for the minority groups
on campus.

Concerning the Publications rep-
resentative, Lowry said he objected
to having this member on_ the
grounds that he is appointed and
not popularly elected.”

The consistency of he above re-
marks indicate a great deal as to
what course the measures ought to
take.

They are still open for alteration
by the EC before being voted on.
The Ring-tum Phi will report furth-
er on these proposals as they are
being considered before the Com-
mittee.

A New Rush System?

The Tuesday Edition has learned that sentiment for a new
rush system here is held by a number of W&L faculty mem-
bers.

Our sources have indicated that one such plan under con-
sideration would delay rush week until the opening of the first
semester of the sophomore year.

Since these feelings are only in the planning stage at pres-
ent, we would like to voice our opinion about possible changes
to be made in our rush system.

 

(1) Any change in the rush system must not come from
the faculty or from the Administration, but from the IFC.

(2) The IFC members should be notified if change is in
order so that they can possibly come up with some workable
solution to the question.

(3) That the faculty members who hold the belief that
rush should be changed place trust in the IFC by allowing that
organization to discuss the problem before an “‘ultimatum”’ is
handed down by the Administration or by the faculty.

The plan to delay rush until the first semester of the sopho-
more year, if adopted, in our opinion would close from five to
six of the fraternities.

Since such a plan would see one full year of fraternity op-
eration without the support from one entire class, we can only
predict doom for some of the houses. It is our hope that this
plan would not be accepted either by the IFC or by the Ad-
ministration.

It must be remembered by those who would change our
present system that just two years ago the IFC rejected plans
for rush revision. Their rejection of any revision should indi-
cate that the fraternities are generally satisfied with the present
system although their vote doesn’t make the present plan right.

Perhaps, however, a new system could be passed this year,
but we can see no real need for adopting such a radical plan as
delaying rush to the sophomore year.

We can understand that our present system has its bad
points, namely that the first thing the freshman sees of Wash-
ington and Lee is not the University but the fraternities.

It also must be remembered that our present system does
have its good points too, primarily that rush comes and goes
really before school gets into full swing.

To reiterate a bit, we exert that any changes should come
from the IFC, and not from faculty members who would see a
plan adopted that would close a number of fraternities.

Sensible reasoning is the only answer to this question.

EC N il Maal Member

The Executive Committee, after a considerable length of
time, has made public the proposed changes in our Student
Body Constitution. The new Constitution, as presented by the
the Executive Committee would seek to make our Student Gov-
ernment more effective and efficient.

On the whole, the new Constitution embodies sound prin-
ciples and should prove to be a benefit to our Student Body.
However, one of the proposed changes would eliminate from
membership on the Executive Committee the Representative
from the Publications Board. We feel that this change would be
an unwise step.

In the past, the representatives from the Publications Board
to the Executive Committee have been highly capable indi-
viduals. Their past records show that they have had the in-
terest, ability and responsibility necessary to serve on such a
position.

One must remember that the Publications Board represents
the largest single group of extra curricula activities in the Uni-
versity. Through the several publications, student activities and
information are publicized. The members of the Publications

Dean of the College

The spectacular successes of Rus-
sian technology and science during
the past five years have inevitably
aroused widespread interest
throughout the free world in the
Soviet educational system. Compari-
sons have been made between Rus-
sian and American education largely
to the detriment of the latter.

A recent book entitled What Ivan
Knows That Johnny Doesn’t—the
title itself is characteristic—explains
“why the American student is infer-
ior to the Russian child in almost
every area of intellectual achieve-
ment.”

A recent study on Education and |
the |
U.S.S.R. demonstrates that the So- |
*viets are outproducing the United

Professional Employment in

States in the training of engineers
and scientists by a substantial mar-
gin and that the proportion of uni-
versity graduates going into teach-
ing is more than twice that of the
United States. The achievements of
Soviet scientists in nuclear physics
point up the uncomfortable fact that
science, at least, can develop despite
the conformity imposed by a totali-
tarian society.

It is essential to an understand-
ing of Russian education to re-
member that schools in the
U.S.S.R. are an instrument of na-
tional policy, consciously used to
create the new Soviet man and
to advance the economic and mili-
tary strength of the Soviet state, a
goal which education can be made
to serve efficiently. As early as
1919 Lenin stated that it was one
of the tasks of the Communist
Party to transform the schools into
“an instrument for the Communist
regeneration of Society.”

The basic unit of Soviet educa-
tion is the ten (now eleven) year
school. In thinly populated areas
there are generally only four-year
primary schools, and in district cen-
ters and cities seven (now eight)
year schools. The corresponding

ent to the American primary, junior
high, and senior high schools—fol-

Campusing Of Freshman Draws Attack
On Work Of Student Control Committee

criticism previously aimed at Dean
Atwood is commendable.

However, in spite of Bill’s com-
ments, I feel their decision to cam-
pus said freshman was an immature
one. The fact remains that a college
student has been punished in a
fashion not unsimilar to punitive ac-
tions employed by prep schools.
Also, it is a fact that Dean Atwood
signed his name to the Committee’s
decision, indicating his approval of
the measures to be taken.

I am fully aware that to offer cri-
ticism without an alternative is
equally as immature as this decision.
It is this student’s opinion, consid-
ering the severity of this freshman’s
action, that he be asked to leave
Washington and Lee for the re-
mainder of the present semester.

Certainly such a repulsive display
of upbringing warrants a period of
self-examination free from academic
| pressures. If memory serves me
correctly, men have been asked to
drop out of the University for les-
ser offenses.

In the future 1 hope Dean Atwood
will offer guidance and sound judg-
ment complementary to his position.

This letter is in no sense an ef-
fort to be unduly caustic. Last Mon-
day, after glancing at the ODK
Board, I was thoroughly ashamed
of Washington and Lee. It is not
out of personal vengence, but con-
cern, that I write the Editor of the
Ring-tum Phi.

Sincerely,

Positions

physical powers.
Now on to greener pastures, the
E. C.

I'm very interested in their pro-
posal to move around some of
their responsibility by taking
away the position held by a mem-
ber of the Publications Board, and
also demoting a senior. I heart-
ily support representative govern-
ment, and I interpret this propos-
al on the part of the EC as an
attempt to make our government
even more representative than it
really is.

I feel that they have sensed one
of the shortcomings of student gov-
ernment here at Washington and
Lee and are taking some bold steps
aimed at correction. Getting rid of
members representing minorities is
important.

But I feel that substituting mem-
bers-at-large is not the right an-
swer to this problem. A member-at-
large by definition would be a blow
to to the solidarity of the organiza-
tion. No longer could the majority
count on each other. And the qual-
ity of candidates would inevitably
fall. A non-fraternity man might
even be chosen.

So I submit my alternative solu-
tion to the EC Representative Re-
vision Plan.

It is short, simple, and a true
American solution to the problems
with which we’re faced in this grave
hour of need.

Since the proposal is aimed at
taking representation away from
non-representative minorities, I
suggest that it be given to more
representative minorities.

Thas is, the members of the EC
are usually very active students to
begin with. A member of the Pub-
lications Board could become a
a member of the EC as a class
representative. But some minori-
ties are utterly without chance of
representation of any sort.

I propose that the EC create posts
for a representative from the Mon-
golian Minks and from the basket-
ball team.

As you all know the Minks were
the center of a minor controversy
last fall. They have now repented
and wish to take part in more con-
ventional campus activities.

I've already mentioned _ their
weekly political discussions, and
now I think it’s time that the EC
give the Minks their due and bring
them into the campus family so to
speak.

I think that the Minks would show
their usual mature judgment and
conscientious behavior, and thus

(Continued on page 4)

 

 

 

 

 

The rigorous demands on the Rus-
sian child made by the schools have
caused concern even to Russian
pedagogues. The ten-year curricu-
lum, with classes meeting six days
a week for 33 weeks, adds up to
about the same number of days in
an American twelve-year course.
There is a very heavy emphasis on
science; and mathematics, chemistry,
biology, and especially physics, are
taught in larger doses in Soviet
schools than in most schools in the
West, taking up over a third of the
total number of hours in the second-
ary school.

The casualty rate in the regular
school system is extraordinarily
high; it has been estimated that less
than 15 per cent of those who begin
primary school will graduate from
high school. This means, as Fred M.
Hechinger has pointed out in The
Big Red Schoolhouse, that the
U.S.S.R. does not have mass educa-
tion as we understand it, but rath-
er a system of public education
which allows all children to enter
elementary school and _ virtually
guarantees their right to basic lit-
eracy as well as to competition for
the right to secondary and higher
education.

The Soviet student knows that
if he fails to measure up at any
point to the requirements he is
likely to be left behind, and thus
to have lost his opportunity to
escape the drabness of ordinary
existence in the Soviet Union and
to have lost his chance to as-
pire to the more glamorous and
remunerative life of the scientist,
University-trained technician, or
member of the intelligentsia. This
realization serves as a compelling
incentive to motivate the student
to work always at his maximum
capacity. The educational chips
are continually down.

For the minority who complete
the high school, there are two types
of higher educational institution
available, the many and varied tech-
nical institutions and the 40-odd
universities. Attendance at all class-
es at these institutions is obliga-
tory, although recently some leni-
ency has been allowed to encourage
independent work. According to a
new ruling, most University appli-
cants will not be considered for ad-
mission until they have completed
one or two years of “productive la-
bor.”

The summit of Soviet higher edu-
cation is “Moscow State University
of the Order of Lenin and of the Or-
der of the Red Banner of Labor,
Named for M. V. Lomonosov.” Rus-
sia’s oldest university, dating from
1755, it has such distinguished alum-
ni as the writers Lermontov, Tur-
genev, and Chekhov.

Moscow University is housed in a
new plant consisting of 37 buildings
clustered around a central skyscrap-
per, which has been described by
Burton Rubin as an “ornate minia-
ture” of the Empire State Building.
It has an undergraduate enrollment
of about 22,000, with a resident stu-
dent-professor ratio of 6.6-1.

Only straight A students or those
with influential connections have a
chance of being admitted to Moscow
University, and more than 90 per
cent receive financial aid from the
state. Six hours of class attendance
a day are compulsory for freshmen.
The program of study in the univer-
sities and technical institutes is de-
signed to prepare specialists rather
than to give a broad education in
the sciences and humanities.

It would be idle to deny the
achievements of the Soviet educa-
tional system. Within a single gen-
eration illiteracy has been reduc-
ed from 60-65 per cent to perhaps
5-10 per cent. The rudiments of
scientific knowledge have been
transmitted to a vast population
not far removed from serfdom.
Great advances have been made in
science and technology and in the
training of specialists in these
fields on a lower, middle, and
higher level.

As George S. Counts indicates, no
other society in history has ever
committed itself so unreservedly to
the development of mathematics and
science. The U.S.S.R. spends more
than twice as much of its gross na-
tional product on education as does
the United States.

These accomplishments, however,
should not blind us to the serious
flaws in the Soviet educational sys-
tem. Originally, spontaneity, and in-
dependence of mind are largely
eliminated by the inflexibility and

place finish in the fourth annual
Virginia Indoor Track Meet, at the
VMI fieldhouse Saturday.

W. and M. Second
VMI captured its fourth straight
title, followed by William and Mary,
Virginia, Virginia Tech, and W&L.
The Generals had a total 12 1/5
points.

W&L’s showing was quite an
improvement over last year when
it wound up ninth in a field of
11. This year it took fifth with
only ten men entered in the meet.

Hickey grabbed third in the 60-
yard dash with a fast 6.3. Essex
came in second in the 880-yard run
with a 2:06.0 after winning the trials
in 2:09.4.

of West Virginia.

A crowd of over 250 sports enthusiasts supported the two
W&L teams, both of which went down in defeat. The mermen
were outclassed by the Panthers and lost.

Dick Miller’s wrestlers lacked that “‘little bit of luck” and
were edged by the Mounties, 16-12.

Charlie Gummy and Eliott Maynard were the only bright
spots for the swimmers against Pitt, but the whole wrestling
team showed a great effort in meeting West Virginia.

Swimming

The Panthers of Pitt took first in
both the 400-yd medley relay and
the 400-yd. freestyle relay, going the
distances in respective times of 5:45.2
and 3:25.2.

Records Fall

Pitt's Ganong bettered the old
pool record by over seven seconds
with a time of 2:05.4 in the 220-yd.
freestyle, defeating McManus and
Wolfe of W&L. Later in the meet,
Ganong again shattered a pool rec-
ord, winning the 440-yd. freestyle
event with a time of 4:59.8.

Ron Levine of Pitt turned in a
spectacular performance by first set-
ting a new record in the 200-yd. in-
dividual medley with a time of 2:06.9
and also shattering the previous
record in the 200-yd. butterfly with
a time of 2:05.8.

His brother, Rob, also made his
addition to Pitt's record break-

ing evening by scoring a first in
the 200-yd. backstroke event, go-
ing the distance in a record time
of 2:01.8 seconds.

In the one meter diving compe-
tition, Pitt’s Perez, after having in-
jured his leg on the first dive, went
ahead to take a first in the event.

(Continued on page four)

 

Wrestling

In two matches, the 123 and 147
lb. classes, the score was tied with
less than a minute remaining, but
both wins were salvaged by West
Virginia in the closing seconds.

Taken Down

Butch West, wrestling in the 123
lb. slot for the Generals, was taken
down with thirty-two seconds left
by Dave Cain to come out on the
short end of a 4-2 score.

In the 147 Ib. division, newcom-
er Pete Winfield was taken down
by crowd pleaser Sam Church
with 31 seconds remaining, to lose
5-4.

Both Dick Albert and Herbie
Smith turned in fine performances
in holding their opponents to 1-1
and 7-7 draws respectively.

Babcock Loses

Sandy Mersereau at 157 was
edged 3-0, while Jud Babcock at
heavyweight, wrestling the Mount-
ies best man, lost, 4-0.

Winning for the Generals were
Dave Montgomery with a pin and
Tom Stover who decisioned his
man, 12-0.

WEGEL Drops
Two Contests
On Journey

Washington and Lee’s basketball
team dropped two consecutive
games this past weekend, the first,
on Friday night, to Catholic Univer-
sity, by the one-sided score of 83-52,
and the second, by 73-70, at the
hands of Washington College.

At one point in the Catholic Uni-
versity game, the Generals led 24-23,
but Catholic started hitting more
consistently from the floor and took
at 14-point lead by half-time.

The W&L scoring attack was
led by Tom Supak with 18 points
and Louie Paterno with 10.

On Saturday, the W&L five was
edged by a 72-70 margin. Although
Washington led by eleven points at
the half, W&L came back and with
4:30 to go tied the count at 62-62.

After the ball had changed hands
three times and the score still even,
Washington took advantage of a
missed shot, took control, and went
on to win by three points. Tom Su-
pak again led the Generals scoring
attack with 21 and ‘Bip’ Fauber tos-
sed in 17.

AMA Edges
Frosh, 62-61

Augusta Military Academy’s fresh-
man basketball team handed the
Baby Generals their fourth straight
defeat, 62-61, in a game played at
Staunton last Saturday.

A.M.A, took the lead from the
start and by halftime led 34-26.
Dick Livingston and Scott Verner
sparked a second half surge which
saw W&L take a five point lead
with three minutes remaining.
The defeat not only left the fresh-

man searching for victory number
eight, but was most costly in that
first stringers Livingston and George
Madison were injured and might
miss the remaining games.

Generals ‘New Look’ Offense
Will Feature Power, Passing

Washington and Lee’s football team will feature a

look”’ offense this fall.

The five-star
switching from a speedy ground
attack to a combination of power
running and passing.

With the graduation of speedsters
Jim Hickey and Doug Martin, two
of the offensive mainstays on the
undefeated 1961 club, the Generals
are left without a fast horse in their
stables.

Power

All top returnees in the backfield
are “bullish power runners rather
than speed demons,” according to
head coach Lee McLaughlin.

First among these “power” run-
ners are rising seniors Charlie Gum-
mey (halfback), Tommy Keesee
(fullback) and Chuck Lane (quar-
terback) and rising junior Stuart
Yoffe (halfback).

Together these four amassed
1,016 of the total 2,182 yards that
the Generals gained by rushing last
year.

Plans call for a stepped-up air
attack this fall because McLaughlin
says he will have an “overall bet-
ter group of passers and receivers.”
The balding Coach quickly adds that
by “better” he means “more experi-
enced” since eight of the Generals
top 12 receivers and two of the top

four passers are back for more
aerial fireworks.
After watching his charges in a

week and a half of spring practice,
McLaughlin says he expects W&L’s
offense to remain on a close par with
the 1961 club which boasted a scor-
ing average of 33.0 points per game.

Defense, however, is the big ques-
tion mark as the Generals enter
their first season as a member of the
newly formed College Athletic Con-
ference. They carry a string of 19
straight games without a loss into
their conference competition with
Centre, Sewanee and Southwestern.

The loss of the first three guards
and Little All-American Center and
linebacker Terry Fohs, the team’s
leading tackler for the past three
years, are the causes of anxiety.

regimentation of Russian educa-
tional methods. Since only achieve-
ment is rewarded and potential ap-
titude ignored, valuable human re-
sources are lost.

Rigidity, conformity and thought
control prevail from primary school
through the university. Claims made
for the achievements of high school
graduates even in science appear
exaggerated in comparison with the
accomplishments of high school
graduates in some countries of
Western Europe.

The quest for truth for its own
sake, the cornerstone of Western,
democratic education, is unthink-
able in the U.S.S.R., where educa-
tion and students are inhumanly
manipulated in an Orwellian fash-
ion to produce the technical la-
bor the State deems necessary to
achieve its social and_ political
aims.

Efficient as it has certainly proved
to be in science and technology,
Russian education will nonetheless
seem abhorrent to most educators
in the Western World. It cannot,
however, be ignored, because we
detest it. It is there, powerful and
ruthless, a challenge to the freedom-
loving, sometimes too easy-going
West.

As for the post for the basket-

In answer to the charge of “dumb

This team is made up of the sort
of people whom I think could best
administer the needs of the Student

And I think by taking their minds
off basketball and putting them into
politics we could do the school a
double service.

Other suggestions I have for the

So Ill do like they do, and wait

Labor vs. Management

Should Anti-Trust Laws
Apply To Labor Untons?
Good Case For Both Sides

(The following report is taken from the research of the highly-
rated W&L debate team, and describes the procedure and arguments
of a formal debate on the subject of labor anti-trust action.)

By STEVE SMITH
News Editor

During 1961-62, college debaters are arguing the question, Resolved:
That labor organizations should be under the jurisdiction of antitrust leg-
islation.

At first glance this question appears to be weighted affirmatively, in
view of the continually increasing power and much-publicized offenses of
labor unions. However, a second examination will
reveal that the question is very evenly balanced and
that neither negative nor affirmative arguments pos-
sess an inherent edge.

The affirmative debaters must prove that there is
intrinsic evil in today’s labor-management relations;
they must present a plan of antitrust legislation which
will remove the evil; and they must prove that their
plan is the best possible solution. If the negative team
can neutralize any one of these three affirmative pre-
sentations, it will probably win the debate.

In proving a need for antitrust legislation, the first
affirmative speaker in a debate has at his command a
tremendous variety of contentions. He can draw from
such union malpractices as price fixing, featherbedding, technological re-
striction (banning of labor-saving devices), restriction of sub-contract-
ing (to “undesirable” employers).

He could also use the argument of union power as the result of in-
dustry-wide bargaining, pointing to ensuing wage-spiral inflation. Unions
have been able to dictate to their employers in the choice of customers,
territory of operation, and in many ways to enter into the product market.

The Inherent Evils Of The Status Quo

By a liberal use of examples the first affirmative concludes that the
status quo is plagued with inherent evils. These examples might include
instances of union picketing, boycotts, or strike power, as well as the above
malpractices. Statistics are available to prove almost any given situation
exists.

The first negative debater must attempt to prove that the status quo is
free of inherent evil, although he is usually willing to concede that unions
have stepped out of line in a few cases. These wrongs, he says, can be
corrected by a means other than antitrust legislation.

This speaker handles much of the affirmative evidence in an unfriendly
manner, claiming that the examples cited were atypical and unrepresen-
tative of the entire labor field. He should be able to present examples
proving the opposite of whatever the affirmative has said to be true.

Affirmative complaints of union strike power he places in the category
of labor disputes; a labor dispute is free from antitrust prosecution, and to
weaken unions in their power to bargain is to threaten their existence.
Moreover, in the labor market the unions must have a monopoly in order
to represent their members to the huge corporations.

Whereas the affirmative has just said that unions are growing more
powerful, the negative now comes up with the fact that union member-
ship is dropping. Also, unions are being successfully prosecuted at the
state level under state antitrust law, so it would be useless to pass more
laws; all that is necessary is enforcement of all the existing statutes.

The second affirmative speaker must establish the plan of antitrust
legislation, which usually consists of amendment of the Sherman and Clay-
ton Acts to allow unions to be prosecuted under these laws. He reviews
the arguments of his colleague and attempt to illustrate that his plan will
solve in every way the problems listed.

Since this usually does not consume a great deal of time, this speaker
is likely to recall and analyze all arguments thus far, showing those of the
affirmative in a favorable light. To counter the negative contention that
strikes involve labor disputes and take place only in the labor market, he
brings up their overwhelming effects in the product market, and says that
because of the cause-and-effect relationship of product and labor markets,
the labor market cannot be treated entirely separately.

Regarding the negative statement that union membership is waning,
he speaks of their increased organization, wealth, and political ascendency.

A Plan To Destroy Labor Unions

In the last constructive presentation of the debate, the second negative
speaker claims that the plan of his opponents will actually destroy unions,
while it is unnecessary in the first place. However, he also claims that the
plan could not possibly work.

All cracks in the affirmative machine are pointed out and widened.
The latest labor laws may outlaw some of the situations provided for in
the plan. The second negative will define antitrust laws in a way which
indicates that they logically have no right to be imposed over the labor
market; he rigidly separates the labor and product markets.

In the rebuttals no major new points are introduced. Each speaker
rises to make his case clear, destroying his opponents’ objections and
giving evidence to prove his contentions. The continued use of statistics
from varied sources to prove conflicting points complicates the arguments.

To debate this topic successfully against a strong team requires a
grasp of the concepts of monopoly, restriction of trade, labor and product
markets, and legal jurisdictions over labor.

The topic was picked by the debate coaches of the United States in a
poll during summer of last year.

Conservative Society To Present
Commandant Weaver on Tuesday

By MALCOLM MORRIS

John O. Weaver, former comman-
dant of the Army’s Psychological
Warefare School, will appear Tues-
day at Washington and Lee.

The assistant to the president of
Communique magazine will speak at
7:15 p.m. in duPont Auditorium. He
will speak on “Semantics as a Com-
munist Weapon.” His appearance is
under the sponsorship of Washington
and Lee’s Conservative Society. The
society, an independent group, was
formed last spring by a group of
students and townspeople.

 

Alumnus Praises

Hell Week Ban

The following was written by a
Washington and Lee alumnus and
former president of PiKA. It is in
response to the recent Hell Week
controversy which resulted in the
abolishment of Hell Week by three
fraternities, of which PiKA was
one.

Excerpts from the letter, writ-
ten to a PiKA freshman, follow.
They consist of this man’s view on
Hell Week and the essense of
what a fraternity can and should
be.

Hell Week was an anachronism; it
was a sort of medieval institution
that should have been abolished long
ago. I gave half a try to do this when
I was a freshman and I failed. I’m
glad that you succeeded.

The idea that Hell Week served
a character building purpose is re-
lated to the barbaric belief that a
man should be made to suffer some-
times to teach him how to “take it.”
This is ridiculous. Human degrada-
tion seldom serves a_ constructive
purpose, and in this case it didn’t.

The other justification for Hell
Week, that it produces class soli-
darity and spirit, is also absurd. Just
about the only thing it ever did was
to create animosity and an infantile
wish to do the same thing to the
following class simply because you
had to go through it. Could any-
thing be more stupid or less manly?

The important think now is your
attitude toward the house, toward
the brothers, and toward future
change. You have gotten rid of a
perverted tradition that wasn’t
worth keeping—this was a definite
good. However, I hope that you will
be careful of what you do in the

Weaver, former special assistant to
the Chief of Information of the U.S.
Army, is a graduate of Northwestern
University and is an ordained Epis-
copal minister.

Communique is a new magazine
published by Communique—The
Cold War Digest, Inc. The magazine
is scheduled to bring out its first
edition later this year.

Weaver served with the Midwest
Division of CBS as news editor and
director of special events from 1936
to 1941. During World War II, he
was a propaganda officer for the
U.S. Army.

From 1950 to 1952, Weaver was
commandant of the Psychological
Warfare School at Fort Riley, Kan.

Don Huffman, co-program chair-
man for the society, stated that
Weaver was not representing any
political group or _ organization.
Weaver spoke last November at the
State Junior Chamber of Commerce
Convention at Natural Bridge.

Brent Arthur, president of the
Conservative Society, said “seman-
tics is a subject very little under-
stood. It involves the double mean-
ings in words. The word ‘peace’ to
communists may mean something
entirely different from our concept
of peace because of semantics.”

W&L Civil War Roundtable is
scheduled to meet at 7:15 p.m. Mon-
day in the Student Union Building

Professors Defend Petition’s

Request For Sophomore Rush

By LARRY MEEKS

“We want to interest the freshmen in the academic side of
the University. We feel that too much emphasis is being placed

74% on the social. This is not a move to try to stifle the fraternities

but a move to create a better University environment,” ex-
plained Dr. E. W. Spencer when asked about the recent faculty
petition concerning the fraternity activities.

 

Wild Beer Bout
Staged At LSU

From the Shreveport Journal

BATON ROUGE, Feb 15— Louis-
iana State University today placed
two fraternities on probation for
staging a beer drinking contest last
weekend.

The Interfraternity Council ord-
ered Kappa Sigma and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon placed on probation for
staging the contest at a local bar. It
began at noon Saturday and ended
at midnight.

Midway through the bout, an ob-
server reported to a newspaper that
one fraternity was leading, 136 cases
to 132, but, the newspaper reported
he seemed hazy about which fra-
ternity was in the lead. There was
no official score at the end of the
bout.

Tuesday at 1:00 p.m.

The Choir will play three selec-
tions for the program: “Canzona No.
4,” Babrieli; “Fantasy on Old Hun-
dredth,” Purcell; and a short piece
“Divertissement,” written especially
for the group by their director, Rob-
ert Stewart.

The program moderated by Ann

He has lectured at several semi-

positive traditions that have been
given up and forgotten in fratern-
ities. Why don’t you survey them,
dust them off, and do a double good
by bringing back what is really
worth keeping?

A fraternity can quite easily de-
generate into an eating club, or into
a loose group of people who just
get used to and can just barely tol-

* Dr. Spencer was one of those in-

strumental in drawing up the pe-
tition. He is well qualified to speak
on the subject as he attended W&L
as an undegraduate and was presi-
dent of his social fraternity.

Concerning the possibility of IFC
action he said, “The IFC has always
acted in what they considered best
for the fraternities. The faculty must
look at what is best for the Univer-
sity as a whole. The faculty would
probably have to take action, but
I think it would be marvelous if the
IFC would do it.”

Trends Toward Reform?

When asked if he thought that
there was already a trend towards
reform, he answered, “My pledge
class rebeled when I was a pledge.
That’s when the KA’s initiated Hell
Week. Some other changes have
also been made such as prohibiting
paddling. The trend is a good one,
but it does not solve all the prob-
lems.”

Dr. Spencer favors moving pledg-
ing to the beginning of the sopho-
more year and initiation to the be-
ginning of the second semester of
that year, believing that “Help Week
will vanish because of the added
maturity of the sophomores.”

Dr. L. R. Emmons was also a lead-
er in drawing up the petition. He
said that he was disappointed in his
students during Hell Week, but he
quickly added that it hasn’t been
just Hell Week. In his words, “It
started back at the first of the se-
mester and only reached a cres-
cendo during Hell Week. I might as
well not have held classes during
that week.”

First Two Weeks “Wasted”

He said that the following week
was also wasted as the students
were “recuperating.” He believes, as
Dr. Spencer does, that “too much
emphasis is placed on the social life
and not enough on the academic.”

He further believes that under the
sophomore or delayed rush system
the students would be “in a better
position to evaluate the fraternity
system.”

Concerning the petition itself, Dr.
Emmons stated, “The petition was
started and intended only to ques-
tion what was going on. It was only
an inquiry. It was not meant to go
to the IFC at the present time. We
wanted to send it to someone and we
didn’t know who. We didn’t expect
all this publicity. In fact, we haven’t
even made a whole-hearted effort
to go out and secure signatures from
all the faculty.

“It is only an introduction to
thought. I still believe in it and hope
that something is done. These are
‘our’ thoughts. I’m not sure that all
the signers endorsed all of these
things; people just favored some
type of reform.”

He believes that by having rush
in the sophomore year, a student
would have a year to look over the
fraternities and see the good points
and bad points of each, and can
make a proper evaluation.

Freshmen “Pushed”

Dr. Emmons feels that by having
rush week during the first week of

the freshman year, the freshmen
are pushed into the fraternities
without having time to evaluate and
decide whether or not he wants to
join a fraternity. He stated that
with 80 per cent of the freshmen
class pledging, a new student feels
that he must join a fraternity in

order to have any fun. Emmons fav-
ors social activities directed by the
administration during the freshman
year. Under that system, according
to him, “The freshman class would

The Faculty Petition

We are puzzled and disappointed by the tone and content
of the petition by some faculty members to put rush week off
to the sophomore year. It seems to us to be one of the most
negative and ill-considered movements to arise on the hill in

some time.

Let’s take a look at the supposed values of a second-year

rush, as listed by the petition:

1. It would allow freshmen to adapt themselves to the
University environment without undue social pressure.

Undue social pressure does not have a great deal to do with
fraternities or early rush. Look at Princeton, for example, or
U.Va. Translated, this argument means “Freshmen would
study more if there weren’t a bunch of fraternity men drag-
ging them down the road against their will.” That’s just wish-
ful thinking. Fraternities can, and do, encourage their fresh-

men to study.

2. It would eliminated the academic loss of the first
week of the second semester of the freshman year.

And lose a week sometime in the first semester of the soph-
omore year. We think Hell Week should be abolished or dras-
tically cut, but this is a problem which is not too closely tied
to rush. If anyone thinks that sophomores won’t put up with
it, witness the stuff they used to put up with for PAN and
White Friars until those two erstwhile organizations met an un-

timely end.

3. It would allow time for a proper evaluation by both
fraternities and prospective members.

A more thorough evaluation does seem to us to be de-
sirable. On the other hand, we feel that the advantages of get-
ting rush out of the way early and removing the pressure for all
concerned, together with the advantages of a longer close asso-
ciation with upperclassmen, outweigh the advantages of a long-

er period before rush.

4. It would strengthen class ties and develop a sense

of pride in the University.

It certainly would strengthen class ties—at the expense

of ties among the classes.

In what way will a later rush develop a sense of pride in
the University, though? Washington and Lee men are as
proud of their university as any other college men we know.
This point needs some explication.

5. It would eliminate the stigma attached to non-fra-

ternity students.

Really? We count many friends among the non-fraternity
students. The supporters of the faculty petition would be in-
terested to find that the non-fraternity men are considered on
the whole to be a better group than two or three of the fra-
ternities. They also might consider that the stigma attached to
some non-fraternity men usually stems from the elements of
their character that prevented them from making a fraternity
rather than from the fact they are NFU’s.

We think that the questions of rush and of Hell Week
deserves a full disccussion. The present petition contributes
nothing to the discussion, however. A close study of the pro-
visions reveals the recurrent attitude of a faculty minority who
tend to blame the fraternities for all the ills of the University.

It just ain’t so.

An Interview With Dean Williams...

 

A Challenge To Fraternities:
Continue Positive Contributions

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Perhaps if any single phrase most
adequately describes Washington
and Lee University, that phrase
would be “rich in tradition.” The
Honor System, conventional dress,
beer at Goshen—these are the things
that have for decades been an in-
tegral part of student life at W&L.
The tradition that has possibly play-
ed the biggest role in creating the
complexion of this university is the
social fraternity. For approximately
100 years, the nucleus of extra-cur-
ricular life has been the various
closely-knit Greek letter societies of
brotherhood.

Dr. Clayton Epes Williams, Dis-

LETTERS

TO THE |».
Ring-tum Phi

Dear Sir: I think all of us at Wash-

ington and Lee realize that our cam-
pus and many of the customs and
traditions that have long been as-
sociated with it are in a period of
re-evaluation and_ transformation.
With almost every issue of the Ring-
tum Phi we read of change in cur-
riculum, Hell Week, student gov-
ernment, social life, ete—the list is
endless. Doubtless, in the over-
whelming number of cases, changes
were needed, and genuine progress
resulted from them.

Nevertheless, in our zeal to im-
prove the University we must be
careful to temper change with good
sense. Those faculty members who
are now advocating the moving of
rush to the sophomore year have
not done this.

Obviously the professors who first
instigated the petition realized that
three hundred sophomores could not
find rooms in Lexington without the
fraternities, and he knew that intra-
murals and social life would be
practically non-existent, but he also
believed that by asking for more
than he wanted, a better bargain
could be driven with the IFC.

This, I submit, is not the proper
procedure for eliminating Help
Week or for changing the rushing
procedure. As long as we do lip
service to Student Government, we
must admit that these certainly are
two areas which must be left en-
tirely in the hands of the students.
If changes are needed, these chang-
es must come from a desire of the
student body, not from faculty pe-
titions.

As we discuss and vote on these
proposals in our various fraternity
meetings, let us do so in a spirit of
doing what is best for the univer-
sity, not in an attempt to appease
the faculty with some small change
which none of us really want.

Very truly yours,
JOHN LACKEY

tinguished Lecturer in the School of
Law, has seen first-hand the influ-
ences wrought on W&L students by
fraternities since 1908. That was
the year Dean Williams came here
as a freshman. Four years later he
graduated from Washington and Lee,
president of Pi Kappa Alpha. He
returned in 1919 after practicing
law for six years and has remained
ever since.

Met in McCrums

In his student days, Dean Wil-
liams recalls that for the most part
fraternities had no houses. Satur-

day nights were meeting nights, and |.
the gavels of the various groups]

were sounded in the little rooms
over McCrum’s Drug Store. A few
began to rent houses, but it wasn’t
until around 1930 that the fraterni-
ties began constructing buildings ex-
plicitly for their purposes.

Membership then averaged 20-25 :

men per house. This was due, ac-

cording to Dean Williams, in part to | ‘

the smaller student body. “I would
suppose also,” he said, “that the in-
creased membership today is oc-
casioned partly as a means of fi-
nancing the houses.”

Rush in Dean Williams’ day was
different, too. “Then,” he said, “it
wasn’t as organized as now. We just
stuck a button on a boy and he
was a pledge.” Nor did the institu-
tion of Hell Week prevail then, al-
though on the night of initiation

  

 

pledges “got the dickens beat out
of them.”

Unwise To Abolish Fraternities

Today, there seems to be a definite
and growing sentiment, especially

 

Dean Williams
Should fraternities be abolished?

among faculty members, for the
abolishment of fraternities at W&L.
How does Dean Williams feel about
this—both as a fraternity man and
a faculty member of Washington
and Lee?

tionally beeen a strong fraternity

‘Living’ And ‘Acting’ Are Same;

Democracy Here

By HOWARD SLATER

There are, no doubt, some
thoughtful individuals who have
asked themselves why anyone would
want to write a column for this
newspaper. They’ve hit upon a good
question. I often ask myself the
same thing; because I know, as they
know, that there must be very few
people who take the trouble to read
this, much less be influenced by
what I have to say.

But there is a reason, as far as
I am concerned anyway, and it’s this:
Even though people may not read
or be provoked into thought by what
is written here each week, an at-
tempt has nevertheless been made
to state what (it is hoped) are
worthwhile thoughts. The moving
forces in life cannot depend for
stimulation on calculations of prob-
able results. That would be a low
way to live.

A Will for Action

Instead, life ought to be motivat-
ed by a will for action, by a belief
that living and acting are synono-
mous terms, and that a life devoid
of acts—stemming from the assump-
tion that nothing can be done to
achieve one’s desired ends—is no
life at all. When we say that the
important thing is “not whether you
won or lost, but how you played the

 

Is Worth A Try

game,” isn’t that a variation on the
same theme?

And to those who contend that
winning, in the broadest sense, is
possible—I say to them that this is
irrelevant. Our greatest tragedians—
the men most sensitive in secular
society to the destinies of other men
—all reader the verdict that men
must inevitably lose in the battle
that is life. And yet, the point for
their texts, Sophocles, Shakespeare,
et al., is always that acting in the
face of such a verdict is what makes
men noble and gives meaning to
their lives.

This is the philosophy to which
this column owes its existence. It
seems to me that this reasoning ap-
plies equally as well to student gov-
ernment at Washington and Lee.
This philosophy comes into direct
conflict with the editorials appearing
this past week in other editions of
the Ring-tum Phi; and for this rea-
son, I reject the conclusion stated
therein.

Now, For That Editorial...

It is true, as the editorials pointed
out, that we do not have a demo-
cratically functioning student gov-
ernment. In fact, it may be closer
to the truth to say that there is

Censor Board
Puts Taboo

On “No Sun”

By STEVE HENRY

The scene: a local art (?) theatre
where a small crowd sits, idly
stomping mice and waiting for the
feature to begin.

Lo and behold. It begins. The
name of the movie is “No Sun In
Venice,” a_ peculiarly lethargic
French flick with music by the
Modern Jazz Quartet.

It isn’t anything special, but the
crowd sits patiently, trying to read
the subtitles that usually appear be-
low the screen.

All is calm.

Unknown to the viewers, however,
a major crisis is arising in the dark
recesses of the manager’s office.

A phone call creates the crisis.
Or we should say a series of urgent
phone calls, all of utmost importance
to the public.

On one end of the line is a rep-
resentative of that admirable group,
the Maryland Board of Censors.

His message is quick, concise
meaningful, and to the point: he
tells the manager that his theatre
has received an uncensored version
of “No Sun in Venice.”

Oh, horrors! The sancity of the
town of Lexington has been threat-
ened. What to do? What to do?

The Maryland board gives the
manager two alternatives: cut out
two particularly objectionable scenes
in the flick, or return the film to
Baltimore, muy pronto.

It is a crisis of staggering pro-
portions, and the manager reacts as
any normal person would under
such pressure and strain: he panics.

(A word here about the scenes
that must be removed from the
movie.)

One, showing a girl pulling a man
down on a bed, is so gross that it
defies description. Why, you could
actually see their heads. Horrors!

The other, showing a girl in a
bathtub, is equally offensive. You
could see her head, too.

But back to the manager, who
faces perhaps the most important
decision of his life.

Rather than attempt to cut out
the scenes himself (Can’t you see the
good manager, scissors in hand, as-
cending those creaky stairs to save
our precious minds from corruption?
The film editors guild cringes at
the thought.), he decides to send the
film back to Baltimore from whence
it came.

His comment on the entire situa-
tion is stoic in tone: “Brother Rat
tonight,” he sighs, thus putting an
end to one of the shortest runs a
movie ever made.

Oh, Virginia. Oh, Maryland, my
Maryland. How good it is to know
that someone is looking after our
interests.

Oh, the ability to make a firm
stand in a crisis. Oh, the saving of
sweet and gentle minds. Oh, censor-
ship, we've lived with you three
years. Without you, our college lives
would be corruption city. Oh,
wonderful. Oh progress, you are
great.

Oh, phooey,
words.

OAS Extremists Lack Supp

By AL BROADDUS

(Editor’s note—This is the sec-
ond article sent us from France by
Al Broaddus, a 1961 W&L gradu-
ate who is studying at the Uni-
versity of Strasbourg under a Ful-
bright grant. He discusses the Al-
gerian question this week.)

The most pressing French political
issue, as everyone knows, is Algeria.
There is no need to repeat here what
has already been said in numerous
books and magazines concerning its
historical antecedents, nor the politi-
cal, economic, and social factors
which have made the current Al-
gerian situation. An extremely in-
teresting aspect of this entire ques-
tion, however, has been the reac-
tion to it in metropolitan France.
Here are my impressions:

Everyone wants a solution to Al-
geria, and soon. The question is, of

 

course, which one. The Secret Army
Organization (OAS), under Gen.
Salan, in its determination to keep
Algeria French, has had tremendous
success in at least making it known
that there exists a segment of the
French population who (very decid-
edly) favor the status quo. To a
great extent the OAS is the effective
government of the Europeans in Al-
geria.

But while the attention paid the
OAS by the press may correspond,
generally, to its position in Algeria
itself, certain articles overrate its
influence in metropolitan France.
Conceivably they may even increase
it. The large majority of Frenchmen
in France, it appears to me, are so
weary of Algeria and its drain on
the French nervous, as well as finan-
cial system, that they are willing to
accept the freeing of Algeria at this

 

point, whatever might have been
their sentiments when the question
was initially brought up.

French Reactions to the OAS

The OAS is aware of this pre-
dominant attitude in metropolitan
France, and has set out upon the
enormous task of whipping the en-
tire nation into favoring the reten-
tion of Algeria. It has not succeed-
ed. It never had a chance. What it
has succeeded in creating, however,
is a tense civil situation in France,
an abnormal atmosphere. This is
particularly the case in Paris. The
demonstrations directed by the FLN
there during the month of October
were largely in reaction to the ac-
tivity of the OAS, as have been the
demonstrations of students and oth-
er bodies since then.

Although the OAS has failed in
its fundamental aims in metropoli-

 

tan France. the reaction to its ac-
tivity has been greater, probably,
than the amount of civil unrest
would merit. The government has
taken, as a result, several repressive
measures, in particular effecting the
press. The Atlantic edition of Time
for January 26, running a cover
story on Gen. Salan, was nearly
banned completely, was forced to
blacken its cover. This has probably,
overall, served to weaken the gov-
ernment and DeGaulle in terms of
popular support, since the French
abhor anything that smacks of cen-
sorship. Thus in this respect the
OAS has been indirectly suecessful
in metropolitan France.

Either Sorrow or Disgust
The reaction to Algeria in France
has not been entirely homogenous,
but, comprehensively, it seems to be
one form or another of either sorrow

 

or disgust. It is the OAS which re-
ceives the brunt of this disgust since
it is often the initiating agent, al-
though the reprisals of the FLN
are equally bloody.

Students and intellectuals have
taken a strong stand against the
OAS, and engage in nationwide
demonstrations. Many of them ac-
cuse the police of supporting the
OAS. (A policeman who entered a
student restaurant where I was sit-
ting, apparently without official in-
tention, was bombarded with pieces
of bread.) Although political sen-
timents entirely apart from Algeria
itself are involved in much of the
movement against the OAS, and
this is particularly true of the stu-
dents, most of the motivation is the
result of the bloodshed involved.

The Paradox
Perhaps the greatest paradox of

 

ort In Crisis-Weary France

the Algerian question is that it has
made the general atmosphere here
in France during the last ten years
entirely different from what it
would have been otherwise.

France, a full participant in the
highly successful European Common
Market, has experienced during the
past decade a great economic expan-
sion. France is at this moment fun-
damentally strong and prosperous.
Her greatest internal problem, ag-
riculture, is based on overproduc-
tion. Algeria, because of the politi-
eal issue which has developed
around it, is a dead weight attached
to a nation which without it would
be progressing at an even faster
rate than it is. It is likely that the
people of metropolitan France, real-
izing increasingly, as they are, the
inappropriateness of the problem
at this point in the nation’s history,
will soon divest her of it.
Varsity Footballers Scrimmage Alumni Saturda

Experienced Graduates
Face ’62 Grid Hopefuls

By LANCE TARRANCE
Assistant Sports Editor
The team that will be Washington and Lee football in 1962
gets its first chance to show its style tomorrow afternoon in
varsity-alumni game to be played at Wilson Field. Game time

is 2:45.

 

Cagers Meet
Emory-Henry
On Saturday

Washington and Lee’s basketball
team, after four straight losses on
the road, moves back into cozy
Doremus Gymnasium tomorrow
night for a game with Emory and
Henry.

The Generals, 5-11 for the year,
have picked up all five wins at
home, and coach Bob McHenry is
hoping to make their last home
stand a victory.

Emory and Henry, however, may
have something to say about that.
The Tigers pasted W&L 75-55 in
December, and McHenry called them
“the best Emory and Henry team
in the last four years.”

“They’ve got a real tall bunch
of boys,” said McHenry, “and they’re
improving every game.”

6-12 Overall

The Tigers, with a 6-12 overall
record, depend on the scoring tal-
ents of two good shooters, guard
John Borke and forward Larry
Shelor.

But Emory and Henry is weak
on ball-handling, according to Mc-
Henry, and the Generals will put
special emphasis on defense, hoping
to force the Tigers into offensive
mistakes.

“We'll have to put more pressure
on their guards,” said McHenry. “If
we're behind, we’ll go into that zone
press that’s worked well for us this
year.”

Monier

McHenry will go with his regular
starting line-up, except at center
where Mike Monier will take over
a starting role from Bill Smith.

“We need Mike under the boards.
He'll add height and scoring punch,”
said McHenry.

He added that the Generals “have
been hurting under the boards this
year.”

Other starters will be Bip Fauber
and Bill Ide at the forwards, and
Louie Paterno and Tom Supac at
guards.

The Emory and Henry game will
end Ide’s and Monier’s basketball
careers in Doremus Gymnasium.
Both are seniors and will graduate
in June.

 

Frosh Play Ferrum Here

Washington and Lee’s freshman
basketball team meets Ferrum Jun-
ior College in Doremus Gymnasium
Saturday afternoon. Game time is
4:30.

The Baby Generals are shooting
for their eighth win of the year.
They’ve lost five.

Ferrum crushed the frosh in an
earlier game, but coach Joe Lyles
is hoping that a home court advan-
tage will help out his squad, which
is still playing without the services
of outstanding rebounder and scor-
er, Jerry Kowalski.

Two weeks of relatively good
weather have given head coach Lee
McLaughlin a chance to get his squad
in shape to meet an alumni team
composed almost entirely of gradu-
ating seniors from W&L’s unde-
feated, untied 1961 Generals.

McLaughlin called the alumni “as
tough as any team we'll meet next
year, and probably tougher,” and
he wasn’t kidding.

Who’s Who

The alumni starting line-up reads
like a who’s who of W&L football
for the past two years, both of
which were undefeated ones for the
Generals.

In the backfield for the alumni
will be Robin Wood at quarterback,
Jim Russ at right half, Wayne
Bradshaw at fullback, and Dave
Thorp at left halfback.

Starting 1961 quarterback Steve
Suttle will see action in the back-
field, but McLaughlin says that “we
might just use him anywhere we
need a good man.”

All-American Terry Fohs, Jerry
Hyatt, Fog Budd, and Bill Wheeler
will be the mainstays of the alumni
line.

An assortment of law students,
VMI graduates, and _ loaned-out
tackles from next year’s varsity will
add depth to the alumni team.

But McLaughlin isn’t too concern-
ed with the outcome of tomorrow’s
game.

Good Look

“We just want to get a real good
look at what our boys can do under
game conditions,” he said. “We'll be
playing everybody, especially our
rising sophomores.”

One aspect of his 1962 team, how-
ever, needs no trial under fire and
that’s the backfield.

Even with All-American Charlie
Gummey unable to compete for the
varsity, McLaughlin isn’t hurting for
talent in his backfield.

Four lettermen, including one
starter from the 1961 squad, will
start for the varsity tomorrow.
They’ll be Chuck Lane at quarter-
back, Tommy Keesee at fullback,
Stu Yoffe at right half, and Henry
Sacket at left half.

In the line for the varsity, Mc-
Laughlin is sure about his starters
at every position except end, where
he has four boys who'll see lots
of action.

Buck Ogilive, John Madison, Mike
Jenkins, and Ed Croft are possible
starters at end for the varsity.

At tackles, it’ll be Bob Payne and
Jim Sylvester, and Mickey Walker
and Joe Houssan will open at guard.
Mike Sheffey will start at center.

The varsity-alumni game
conclude spring practice for the
Generals.

 

Notice

Basketball fans might be interest-
ed in knowing that the Group I-B
high school tournament is currently
being played in the VMI fieldhouse.
Consolation finals and finals are
scheduled tonight, with Waynesboro
meeting Parry McCluer in the
championship game at 9 p.m.

Potent Combination For Alumni—Suttle Hands Off to Russ.

 

Wrestlers Meet Virginia

Monday In

Season Finale

The Washington and Lee wrestling team puts the wraps on
one of its most successful seasons in recent years Monday when
it travels to Charlottesville for a match with the University of

Virginia.

The Generals, now 6-3 for the year, are in good physical

shape for the match against the*

Whaoos, and Coach Dick Miller
thinks chances are good for victory
number seven.

“Tf we can forget the way West
Virginia nicked us,” Miller said, “we
ought to be able to handle them.”

Inconsistent

He added, however, that UVa. has
been inconsistent this year, and
that the Wahoos could be up for
this match, hoping to get back at
the Generals for a 28-0 shut out
handed to them at Lexington last
year.

Miller called Virginia “especially
tough in the 157-pound class.”

The Generals will go with their
regular starting lineup against Vir-
ginia. Butch West and Jud Bab-
cock, both hampered with injuries
during the last two weeks, will be
ready to go.

Mersereau

The Virginia match will close out
the varsity career of W&L senior
co-captain Mersereau.

Mersereau, who has compiled a
5-4 record this year against what
Miller called “extra fine competi-
tion,” is the only starter the Gen-
erals will lose from the 1961-62
squad.

A four-year letterman, Mersereau
has a 26-9-1 record, and Miller

SAE Tops DTD

For BKB Title

SAE overcame an 18-14 halftime
deficit to down the Delts 32-27 and
capture the Intramural Basketball
Crown. Only four players scored
for the victors as they ended the
1961-62 season with an unblemished
record.

Led by the shooting of Doug Mar-
tin, the Delts jumped off to an early
lead and stopped Charlie Savage
and Henry Sackett from doing any
considerable scoring. The quick-
moving Delt zone limited these two
SAE hoopsters to a total of ten
points in the first twenty minutes.

Baskets by Bull Roberts, Sackett,
and Savage tied the score in the
first two minutes of the second half.
After a foul shot by Savage, a jump
shot by Sackett put the SAE’s in
front 23-20. Another hoop by Sackett
gave the winners a lead they never
lost.

Sackett led all scorers with 14
points, while Savage contributed five
baskets and two charity tosses. The

Jackets Clip
W&L, 70-55

Ashland, Feb. 22—Randolph-
Macon’s basketball team took the
lead after six minutes and never
was headed here Thursday night in
a 70-55 victory over Washington and
Lee.

It was the final game of the regu-
lar season for the Yellow Jackets,
who finished with a 16-5 record and
a tie with Norfolk W&M for the
Little Eight championship.

As usual, Al Roberts, with 23
points, and Frank Kaminski, with
19, paced the Randolph-Macon at-
tack. Rodger Fauber led W&L with
15 and Lou Paterno had 11 for the
Generals, now 5-10 over-all.

The Yellow Jackets moved ahead
for keeps at 18-14 after 5:55 of play
and were in front, 32-25, at halftime.
After intermission, the Jackets
steadily pulled away as Roberts
banged in seven of his nine field
goals and Kaminski hit 10 of 13
foul shots down the stretch.

It was 67-47 with 4:14 remaining
and the Jackets coasted in.

Kaminski collected 13 of his 19
points from the free-throw stripe as
W&L fouled repeatedly. Randolph-
Macon converted 26 of 34 charity
toses, the Generals only 13 of 19.

 

Riflemen Manage Split
In Two Dual Matches

Washington and Lee’s rifle team
managed a split in two matches
against major school competition
this week, defeating George Wash-
ington, but losing to Wake Forest.

Freshman John Rosenberg led the
Generals over GW, 1361-1356. He
fired a team high 279 at the VMI
range.

Wake Forest, however, turned
back W&L 1377-1369 in Winston-
Salem. Dave Auld was high for the
Generals with a score of 283.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Abolition of Fraternities Here

Called “Unwise” By Dr. Williams

(Continued from page 2)

school, and they have contributed
a positive good to the life of the
university. I doubt the wisdom of
abolishing them here.

“The reasons for the professors’
objecting to fraternities are, first
of all, because they (the fraternities)
are undemocratic; also they take
some of the loyalties from the school.
This is shown in preference for in-
tramural athletics, etc.”

Discussing these objections, Dean
Williams dwelled for a moment on
the “undemocratic” contention.
“You can’t force social contacts on
a student against his will. If there
were no fraternities, then there
would be clubs of some sort. I
don’t think the student can be
democratic in his personal, intimate
contacts. There has to be some con-
geniality there. On a social level, you
are going to have cleavages as long
as you have people.”

He said, also, that some profes-
sors feel fraternities take away from
academic pursuits. He pointed out
that “without fraternities, some of
this would still happen. Fraternities
hold up, according to him, “pretty
well with non-fraternity averages.”

Commenting on the benefits of
fraternity life, Dean Williams said
the “relationship and fellowship with
the other members’ of _ the
fraternity” is what he _ prizes
about his membership in one
“This kind of situation is more
apt to occur in a fraternity than
out of one.” He added that, while
one goes to college primarily for an

 

Brass Choir to Perform
(Continued from page 1)

Lead male roles will be filled by
John Baker as Black Weaver, Phil
Booth as the Leader and Preacher,
and Scott Iocone as the Father.
Weill also wrote the very successful
“Three Penny Opera.”

The program will include a con-
cert version of “Down in the Valley”
and also selections by the Mary
Baldwin group and the Glee Club.

The Glee Club has added several
news songs to its program for this
concert. Among these are: “Conceit-
ed,” a burlesque, featuring a vocal
quartet with the Glee Club; “Echo
Song,” an antiphonal composition
by di Lasso; and a new quiet ar-
rangement of “Tom Dooley” featur-
ing the Baritone section of the club.

 

education, “the bookworm doesn’t
get the most out of it. He will prob-
ably be working in the back office
for the man out front with the
good personality. Fraternities teach
the social graces, cooperation, etc.
Although I’ve known a few who
haven’t belonged to fraternities, I
think it is true that the majority of
potential campus leaders are fra-
ternity members.”

Asked if he thought fraternities
had done anything over-all detri-
mental to the intellectual life of the
university Dean Williams answered
with a decided “no.” He also dis-
missed the theory that fraternities
contribute to the students’ moral de-
generation. “We have just as high-
moral individuals with them as we
would without.”

On the matter of deferred rush-
ing, Dean Williams feels it would
be better for the rushees and the
houses. Both, he said, make mis-
takes that might be avoided by a
later rush. He added, however, that
“it’s pretty radical to put rushing
off until the sophomore year, and
I don’t think it will go through now.
They have tried to do it a number
of times in the past and haven’t suc-
ceeded.”

Who on the faculty supports the
abolishment of fraternities? Dean
Williams said, “It would be my
guess that it is the younger pro-
fessors instigating the movement. I’m
not sure about general faculty senti-
ment, however.”

“There is a swing of sentiment
against fraternities. If fraternities
want to remain, they have to con-
tribute something positive. Frater-
nities are realizing this, and their
reaction may counterbalance the
sentiment against them. They are
on trial and it is up to them to pro-
duce.”

put up with the abuses of the fra-

Emmons maintains that the
change would only be a burden on
the fraternities for the first year
after it was initiated. In short he
stated that it is time for a re-eval-
uation among the fraternities, and
students, and the faculty as to
whether or not there is undue em-
phasis placed on the social life as
opposed to the academic life.

In an interview on Thursday
morning, Dean Atwood stated that
the petition still hasn’t been official-
ly received by the administration.
When it is received, probably a spe-
cial meeting of the faculty Fraterni-
ty Committee will be called to con-
sider it.

Slater Speaks Out on Student Government

(Continued from page 2)

hardly any student government at
all; for when we look for it, what
do we find but a few committees
whose sole purpose, apparently, is
to make sure we behave like good
boys—one to keep us from writing
on library walls, one to keep us in
Windsor knots, one to keep us hon-
est, and so on.

In contrast to what is, we need
look no further than the platform of
last year’s successful candidate for
President, to see what could be. Mc-
Thenia proposed that student gov-
ernment could and ought to be the
basis for the establishment of stu-
dent groups with interests in na-

tional politics. Student government | :

condition of student life. There have
been a number of theories about
what caused the political upheaval in
last year’s student elections. I think
that what we saw happening then
was a genuine wave of resentment
against the Establishment, against
shoo-in elections.

That resentment had its effect for
only a little while; there have been
few recent ripples on the calm sur-
fac of our status-quo. But because
that upheaval failed to produce any
significant growth of democracy in
student government, because the
student body once again abdicated
its responsibilities to be coneerned,
and because an attempt to achieve

 

something positive was frustrated—
these are not reasons for contend-
ing that the attempt should not be
made again, and again and again.

It is the attempt which really
counts, in student concerns as well
as all bread of life; not for the sake
of any sacred cow of success, such
as ODK, but because acting—wheth-
er as student leader or student fol-
lower—is what makes life meaning-
ful, anytime, anywhere. Let’s hear
no more about the improbabilities
of student democracy. A democratic
student government—indeed a fun-
ctioning student government—is a
worthwhile goal. The effort should
always be made.

one project a trial debate involving | |
our own debate team. Student in-|*

publicity which student government |)
could evoke, would probably be as| ':

great as is usually the case when a
school has a winning team. In short,
action by our student government,
be it a democratic or non-democrat-
ic organization, is possible.

Now as for the democracy which
we do not have—it is true that
Washington and Lee, like England,
has its “Establishment,” its “in”
group, and that this is the pattern
which normally prevails in student
governments in most schools. It is al-
so true that those who are “estab-
lished” have become so because most
of the student body have abdicated
responsibility and the desire to par
ticipate.

The Political System

However, there are other factors
which have nurtured the mainten-
ance of W&L’s Establishment—the
most obvious being the political sys-
tem. Be that as it may, there is no
reason why because this is the pres-
ent condition, it ought to remain the

‘Protest’ Editors Quiz Executive

Two Students Present New Constitution

New Draft Features Senate;
Change In Honor System

By KEN

Associate Editor
The draft for a new Student Body Constitution has been

drawn up by junior Bill Lowry
Ben Brown.

The Constitution provides for a Student Senate which shall
be invested with the legislative powers of the Student Body.

The new Constitution, and the*
Student Senate, in particular, stand
as an attempt to combat student
apathy and draw greater interest
in student participation.

The Constitution specifies that
the Senate “Shall be composed of 30
elected representatives, six each to
be elected from the freshman, soph-
omore, junior, and senior academic
classes; and six to be elected from
the Law School.”

The Constitution further stipu-
ulates that at least one of the rep-
resentatives shall be elected from
the non-fraternity members of the
student body.

An Executive Committee is pro-
vided with judicial and executive
powers of the University.

The 12 members of the committee
will be composed of representatives
from each class, the three big Stu-
dent Body offices, and two mem-
bers elected at large.

The only radical change in the
procedure of the EC is the provision
granting that if a charge constitutes
a clear violation of the Honor Code,
the Committee shall determine
whether the case warrants expul-
sion for a year or permanent dis-
missal.

Uncas McThenia, President of the
Student Body, stated that there
were some aspects of the draft
which he endorsed and some that he
strongly disapproved of.

One provision he stated particu-
lar disapproval of was the one con-
cerning the power of the EC to
suspend a student as an alternative
for an Honor Violation.

The Student Senate serves as the
most distinctive feature of the Con-
stitution.

The legislative jurisdiction con-
cerns such powers as:

IFC To Work With Dance Board

By T. D. EDWARDS
Associate Editor

The Student Union was witness
last night to another long, and this
time, very controversial meeting of
the IFC. The topics of discussion
were Rush Week and _ fraternity
combos during dance week-ends.

Steve Galef, Dance Board presi-
dent, began an address to the IFC,
by thanking the fraternities for their
cooperation during the Fancy Dress
concert and for their planned co-
operation for the Spring concert.

He stated, however, that atten-
dance at the dance was still too
poor to justify the money being
spent.

Galef felt that the attempts by
the Dance Board Advisory Council
and Faculty Social Committee to
bring good entertainment and to
create student interest has resulted
in an improvement in dance at-
tendance.

However, the fraternity combos
are in direct conpetition with Uni-
versity - sponsored dances. Galef
asked for a compromise.

Bob Doenges, IFC president,
pointed out that the Faculty Com-
mittee on Fraternities and Faculty

Doenges responded by saying the
dance sets are functions of the Uni-

combos, and now these combos have
begun to infringe on University en-
tertainment.

Many solutions were offered
which included an extension of Sat-
urday night combo hours to 3 a.m.,
pending faculty approval.

Also voiced was the idea to pro-
hibit any combos for the first two
hours of any University function.
This would allow unopposed con-
certs and partially unopposed danc-
es.

EC Kills Proposed Change

In Conventional Dress
By KEN LANE

The Executive Committee last night voted down a motion
that Conventional Dress be dispensed with after 9:00 p.m.

The faculty peition for the postponement of rush week was

 

“Our main concern,” Brown stat-
ed later in a personal interview, “is
to broaden the base of student gov-
ernment, to get more student in-
volvment in student affairs.”

The condition which he attacks is
the prevailing student apathy.

Brown maintained that one com-
bative would be a greater dissem-
ination of information on EC mea-
sures and reports.

Student Senate Needed

The Student Senate, besides pro-
viding greater student participa-
tion, would help meet this need,
Brown explained.

Brown and Lowry submitted be-
fore the EC a request that the Com-
mittee work in conjunction with
Protest on a survey of student views
on all reform matters.

Brown stressed the need for moti-
vating student interest in both cam-
pus activities and outside concerns.

Appealed to EC

He appealed to the EC to take
greater leadership in playing the
role.

His proposed Student Senate, he
stated, is an attempt to draw in
greater student participation by
placing the student body govern-
ment on a more democratic basis.

Brown further expressed a grie-
vance against the limited potential-
ity of the student in campus affairs.

He stated the desire that this
group be given greater representa-
tion in the various governing bodies.

Vote Next Week

The EC moved to refer the dis-
cussion of the constitution until
next week. The vote on the first
three sections of the recently re-
leased EC constitution will take
place next week.

 

2 Campus Buildings
Nearing Completion

A $2,000,000 construction
project involving two major
buildings on the Washington
and Lee University campus is

‘|nearly three-quarters done.

Only interior and trim work re-
main on a four-story dormitory for
freshmen, while the $1,400,000 sci-
ence facilities are nearly half com-
pleted, D. E. Brady, Washington
and Lee superintendent of buildings
and grounds, reports. Contractors
have promised the buildings for use
in September.

The installation of a new steam
boiler and other improvements to
the University’s existing heating
plant at a cost of more than $50,000
should be finished within two weeks,
Brady said.

Dorm Houses 91 Students

The new dormitory will house 91
students and will complete a three-
unit student housing center. Two
other buildings—Newton D. Baker
Dormitory for upperclassmen and
John W. Davis Dormitory for law
students—were opened in 1959.

Only 277 students can be accom-
modated in the regular freshman
dormitory, while the university’s
normal freshman enrollment as 320.

A special feature of the new
dormitory will be a 15-bed infirm-
ary.

Contract price for the building is
$326,545,

 

The largest project in Washing-

parments of physics and _ biology
plus a new wing and some remodel-
ing for the existing science build-
ing, Howe Hall.

Observatory for Physics

The University plans to provide
all four scientific departments with
modern instructional laboratories
and classrooms, library and display
areas, special facilities, including an
observatory for physics, a vivarium
and greenhouse for biology, a seis-
mology room for geology and an
instrumental analysis laboratory for

Result of Two-Year Program

The science facilities are a di-
rect result of a two-year develop-
ment program in which Washington

Re See

By GEORGE HONTS
Tuesday Columnist
A sagacious member of the
Washington and Lee faculty once
told a class, “Gentlemen, you live
in a monastery.” We laughted at
the time, but when the news of
the faculty petition broke and fra-
ternity men began speculating
about the consequences of it, the
point rushed home to me.

I still stand opposed to the cur-
rent petition, but on a second
thought and the suggestion of a
fraternity brother, I called on Dr.
Emmons Sunday. Although he
he seemed to be a man who had
answered the same question too
many times, I came away with a
better understanding of the situa-
tion.

Apparently this “segment” of
the faculty does not 1. want to de-
stroy the fraternity system, or 2.
want to abolish Help Week—al-
though this would be a welcomed
by-product of the reform. The real
objective of the petition is to re-
store a balance between social and
academic activities. Maybe I’m
dense, but that point did not em-
erge from the petition or the dis-
cussions of it.

Some of the faculty apparently
feels that the social side of W&L
life is over-emphasized while the
studies are given a less import-
ant place than they deserve. And

| Rush To End Of F Year

Faculty Wants To Restore Social, Academic Balance

proposed the much - debated
change—with the realization that
the IFC or other student groups
would not be willing to discuss
such a proposal.

Whether such an imbalance ex-
ists or not is a moot question.
From the faculty viewpoint it
does, from ours it probably does
not. However, the faculty has
forced our hand. If we could bear
to sit down and think it out, the
present system probably does need
some change; but not necessarily
the one which has been proposed.

The proposed alteration in the

system apparently stems from the
experience of certain faculty
members who witnessed such a
change when they were under-
graduates—without the loss of any
houses—altogether their system
was unquestionably different from
ours in several respects.

Dr. Emmons left me with the
impression that the group of the
faculty which backs the petition
wants some change, and though
this is the one they settled on,
they would be willing to accept
any constructive change which
would allow them to “get to the

Only True

freshmen first” for the sole pur-
pose of “motivating them in their
studies.”

Like most fraternity men, I like
the system as it is. However, if
some change in Rush and Help
Week could be worked out which
would be satisfactory to the fra-
ternities and still passify the more
demanding members of the fac-
ulty (who are usually the ones
from whom students learn the
most) then we will all be “better
off.”

Which puts us back where we
began. Unless we want the fac-

ulty and the administration to
force some alteration on us, how-
ever reluctant they may be, how-
ever distasteful it might be, the
students, in particular the fratern-
ity men, had better come up with
some compromise solution.

Dr. Emmons himself suggested
another change which seems more
palatable. The suggestion is to
have Rush Week at the end of the
freshman year, thus eliminating
the social pressure at the begin-
ning of the college career, Help
Week per se, but still allowing for
housing sophomores, as_ pledges,

EDITORIALLY SPEAKING

IFC Shouldn’t Act In Haste

The IFC, we are happy to report, last night named George
Honts as the chairman of the IFC Rush Week Committee, and
it is our hope that this committee will be able to come up with
a feasible solution to the faculty petition circulated last week.

We hope that the IFC committee will not act in haste, and
that their findings will be based on sound and mature judg-
ment.

It appears to the Tuesday Edition that the main item which
the faculty members who signed the petition want is the abol-

ishing of Hell Week.

It goes without saying that the proposed sophomore rush
system has its drawbacks. The drawbacks of such a system have
been aired, and it should appear obvious that such a system
would not offer any solution that would be accepted by the
IFC or by the fraternity members.

We hope that the IFC won’t act in haste, and that any solu-
tion that the IFC comes up with will be a solution palatable
to both sides involved in this question.

Reporters Should Be Allowed
To Attend EC Meetings

The Executive Committee’s proposed constitution, it ap-
pears to us, lacks one major factor, and we hope that this sit-
uation eventually will be rectified.

The area of which we are speaking pertains to the closed
meetings which the Executive Committee is presently condon-
ing. The EC has chosen to keep their legislative meetings
closed——not open to reporters from various campus media.
As a result of the ‘closed’? meetings, the EC is enclosed by a
web of secrecy.

Of course the EC members will tell you that the minutes
are being published and that the EC is available for comment
on current matters. The system of the dissemination of inform-
ation from the Committee’s meetings, we must asert, is one
which needs changing, since the Ring-tum Phi, along with oth-

its usefulness is suspect. However,
there are certain facts that can be
stated with some assurance and
other aspects which can be looked
to for a reasonable indication of
what sort of military establish-
ment has been developed by the
Soviet Union.

Historically the Russians have
never produced a good army. The
forces used in the eighteenth cen-
tury and in the nineteenth against
Napoleon, the Ottoman Empire
and in the Crimean War were
characterized by their largeness
on the one hand and thir inepti-
tude on the other. This condition
tended to get worse instead of
better and was climaxed by the
defeat at the hands of the Japan-
ese in 1905 and the complete col-
lapse of the military in 1917.

Under the Soviet government
the constituted forces continued to
be notably inefficient. The re-
verses initially inflicted on them
by Finland in 1937 once again
pointed up the general ineffective-
ness of Russian arms. Through the
rest of World War II the Soviet
Armies, while defeating the Ger-
mans, at no time displayed more
than the most rudimentary stra-
tegic and tactical ability. Although
the double envelopment was much
talked of, it was rarely success-
fully executed. The use of the
frontal attack combined with
crudly massed artillery was their
most common approach.

It would be heartening if it
could be assumed that the histori-
cal pattern would continue. In
fact it might—but there are cer-
tain changes, most of them non-
military, which indicate that sub-
stantial refinement has_ taken
place.

The Russian approach still tends
to be one of mass. They have in
their standing army about 175

   

in the fraternity, and for no loss
of revenue to the fraternities dur-
ing the sophomore year. By a lit-
tle arithmetic (which is one course

of freshman revenue by the house
house with 20 pledges would mean
about a $10 raise per month for
the actives—or about the same as
social assessments for a period of
a year.

While our House, and most oth-
er houses, would never willingly
subscribe to the postponing of
Rush until the sophomore year,
there may be an area of improve-
ment on which we can settle. It
will be interesting to see if the
IFC members can come up with a

divisions with an organized re-
serve which will raise this to ap-
proximately 300 in time of war.
While these divisions are only
about one-half the size of an Am-
erican one and include support
type units grouped in division-
size organizations they still con-
stitute a larger in-being force than
that supported by the United
States.

Parity must be assumed in com-
bat aircraft while the naval capa-
bility of the United States remains
ahead of the Russians.

In addition, of course, the Soviet
Union has nuclear weapons which
in both amount and destructive
ability can be presumed equal to
ours.

However, Russia has always
been able to impress in terms of
size. Significant changes are to
be found in other areas.

Never before has the Russian
army been able to rely upon a lit-
erate soldiery who, in addition, are
becoming increasingly familiar
with the gadgetry of an indus-
tralized nation. This is vital to her
because it allows both the produc-
tion and intelligent use of soph-
isticated equipment and in turn
far more rapid and advanced
training. This education and back-
ground is important not only in
the combat skills of the soldiers
and officers but also in the effici-
ency of staffing procedures. There
is a much more direct relationship
between educated officers from an
industrial society and competence
in logistics for instance than there
is between effective front-line
soldiers and literacy. An indica-
tion of the progress in this area
may be taken from the rapid con-
centration of forces carried on by
the Russians during the Hungari-
an revolt. The staff planning in-

volved in that move must have
been of a very high order.

The industrial progress in the
Soviet Union will allow the pro-
duction of not only the more nor-
mal weapons of war but also
large amounts of such things as
communications equipment and
gunnery devices which have al-

their military thinking seems ad-
vanced and sound.

The foregoing indicate that we
must anticipate a greatly improv-
ed military establishment. There
are, however, some indices which
raise a degree of legitimate doubt
as to how much improvement.

The first and most obvious one

While the Russian soldier is not
a fanatic (up to battalion-size
units surrendered to the Germans
in World War II) he must be
counted on as loyal in a political
sense, strongly motivated nation-
alistically and much less naive
than we would perhaps like to be-
lieve.

Soviet military doctrine, as
taught in their very good educa-
tional system, shows much ap-
preciation of the use of new wea-
pons and tactics. While no new in-
novations can be assumed from
what they have published and,
more importantly, from the way
they have organized their forces,

The EC, in our opinion, must remember that it was stu- |

owes to those students who elected them a right to be informed | |
as to what is going on within the Committee.

The EC fails to realize that in their meetings they, like any
governing body, can go into “executive session’”’ at any point,
and the press would be asked to leave the meeting.

The proposed abolishing of the representative from the
Publications Board, like it or not, will eliminate a contact be-
tween the newspapers and the EC. Now that the representa-
tive from the Publications Board will probably be done away
with, the Ring-tum Phi will be removed farther and farther

to point out to

this group a few
of the difficulties I think they might

| encounter if they succeed in their

attempt to move rush week to
sophomore year.

One of the points in the petition
is that it would eliminate the stig-
ma attached to NFU’s. I maintain
that it would only increase what-
ever stigma they’re talking about,
and would further damage all of the
interrelations of non-fraternity men.

By this I mean that for a solid
year there would be a whole class
full of nothing but NFU’s, and fra-
ternity men would be perfectly jus-
tified in shunning them socially.
This would be a natural reaction

to the threat which would be posed
to their system. And among NFU’s
themselves, no good would come of

a sudden increase in the roll of the
Campus Club.

NFU’s would have no way on
earth of knowing who was a short-
term NFU, and who is one for the
duration. This would leave a tre-

mendous gap in the social life of
all students concerned—a gap which

the faculty would do well to consid-
er.

Like Bull Roberts says, some of
my best friends are NFU’s, and
I’m always careful to make sure that
I meet several each year in order
not to be charged with discrimina-
tion. But imagine the position stu-
dents (NFU’s and fraternity men
alike) will be in if no one knows

is that, except for advisor groups,
the Soviet army has not been in
combat since 1945. It is interest-
ing to note in this connection that
whenever Soviet advised troops
have fought in the type of warfare
which would be used in Europe in
a non-active atomic war they have
reverted to the mass frontal at-
tack techniques. Guerilla warfare
as used in Southeast Asia can-
not be credited to the Russians
but rather to the Chinese.

From the point of view of size,
The Soviet Union while maintain-
ing a larger force does not have
any where near the margin for
expansion in time of war that the
United States has. Her require-
ment for a proportionally high
farm population and her smaller,
less efficient industrial base limits
her severely in this respect.

In addition a certain clumsiness
in the logistic field continues to
plague Soviet operations as for
example their large-scale maneu-
vers in Europe.

Tactically her artillery tech-
niques remain weak in compari-
son to the United States.

It is patent that the Soviet Union
has made real gains in the mili-
tary field. Gains which are large-
ly the result of the over-all ad-
vances in literacy and the eco-
nomic capability of the country.
On the other hand it is doubtful
that they have overcome a certain
rigidity in both command and staff
work, and further, have really ab-
andoned the characteristic fas-
cination with mass as the basic so-
lution to all tactical problems.

There is no real answer to the
effectiveness of any military es-
tablishment except war. The hope
is that the answer will never
come. In line with this, it is of
more than passing interest that at
no point where American troops
have been presented has_ the
West lost ground.

123, but Butch West, who moved up
a weight class to wrestle 130, lost
by decision, 6-0. Tom Stover won by

the lopsided score of 13-4 to put

W&L out ahead.

ginia outlasted Dickinson to take a
9-5 decision in the 130 lb. class.

At 147 sophomore Mike Brum-

SUPAK, PATERNO PACE VICTORY

 

Five Players Hit Double Figures
As Generals Swat Wasps, 99-81

By HARRY MEEM
Tuesday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee’s bas-
ketball team went on a scor-
ing binge Saturday night in
the last home game of the sea-
son, beating the Emory and

Henry Wasps 99-81.

The Generals put five players in
double figures, topped by Tom Su-
pak’s 22 points. Emory and Hen-
ry’ Gerald Burke was high scorer
for the game with 29.

W. and L. took the lead for the
first time in the game with six min-
utes left in the first half, when Bill

 

The Generals bowed to Norfolk
William and Mary last night, 75-
69 in their final game of the sea-
son.

Tom Supak led the Generals
with 24 points while Bip Fauber
threw in 13 markers.

The Monarchs closed with a
17-3 season slate. Their last loss
came at the hands of the Generals
January 22. They went on to win
11 in a row and close with the best
court record in their history.

 

Ide hit on a jump shot to make the
score 20-18. Rodger Fauber, Mike
Monier, and Ide pushed the lead to
30-26 before the Wasps came back,
on the shooting of Bob and Jim
Hughes, to take a 39-36 halftime
lead.

Then came the explosive sec-
ond half, in which the Generals
scored 63 points, more than they
scored in both halves when they

 

lost, 75-55, at Emory.

Jim Hughes and Burke hit on
jump shots for the Wasps, sand-
wiched around a jump shot by the
Generals’ Louie Paterno, to make
the score 43-38. Then Paterno, Fau-
ber, and Ide started hitting, large-
ly on jump shots, to run the score

to 49 for W. and L. before Emary
and Henry could score again.
Fauber’s layup at 17:50 of the half
gave the Generals a lead that they
never relinquished.
Paterno, Fauber, Monier, Ide and
Tom Supak continued to hit on a
(Continued on page 4)

 

ended in a 14-14 tie.

Sparked by halfback Henry Sackett’s power thrusts and
quarterback Chuck Lane’s imaginative play selection, the var-
sity took the opening kick-off and drove to the alumni’s 20-

yard line where they relinquished the ball.

The varsity held the alumni to*

three downs, and a high pass to the
punter, Steve Suttle, gave the ball to
McLaughlin’s charges on the alumni
12 yard line. John McDaniel skirt-
ed the right end on the third play
from scrimmage and scored standing
up to give the varsity a 6-0 lead.
The conversion attempt by Lane
added two more points for the var-
sity.

The remainder of the first half
was a defensive stand-off with
neither team being able to pene-
trate deep into the other’s terri-
tory.

Henry Sackett received the kick-
off in the second half on his own 30
and sped up the middle for 70 yards
to score putting the varsity ahead
14-0.

Wood Passes

The only serious alumni threat in
the third period came when the
Robin Wood, Wyatt Durette, and
Phil Sharp aerial trio combined to
drive to the varsity’s 10-yard line.
There the defensive line, led by
Mike Sheffey, Tim Sylvester, and
Buck Ogilvie, stifled the ‘oldsters’
attempt to tally.

Suttle Scores
With four minutes remaining in

 

the game the alumni caught fire. A
wood to Suttle pass caught the var-
sity Red team napping, and put the
alumni back in the game 14-6, the
two point conversion brought the
score to 14-8,

The alumni took over again at
mid-field and eight plays later
Dave Tharp took the ball over
from the two-yard line to even
the score 14-14,

The contest exposed several weak
spots to be mended before the 1962
season, but Coaches Lee Mc-
Laughlin, Leslie, and Williams were
pleased with the varsity’s perform-
ance against the heavier alumni.

Half-back Bill David and tackle
Chuck Long, both rising sopho-
mores, turned in exceptional per-
formances. Mike Sheffey proved
himself as an offensive center, and
on defense may prove to be more
than an adequate replacement for
for departing Little All-Ameri-
can Terry Fohs.

Perhaps the most impressive per-
formances, least obvious on the
muddy field, were those of four
sophomore ends; Buck Ogilvie, Mike
Jenkins, John Madison, and Ed
Croft.

 

“Consistent,” a word seldom used
to describe Washington and Lee’s
basketball, is the best possible de-
scription of sophomore guard Tom
Supak.

Since the Christmas break, Supak,
who is from Virginia Beach, has
been the workhorse on a W&L team
that has dropped to a 6-10 record.
After scoring only 35 points in the
Generals first five games, Supak
hit his stride with a 30-point effort
against Lynchburg College January
6 and he hasn’t let up since.

Only once in the last nine games
has the 6-2 guard, who loves to
drive for his baskets, dipped un-
der 16 points. His average for
these nine games is 18.3 and his
season mark is 14,3,

If W&L’s opponents are any judge
of Supak’s ability, he must be rat-
ed high on the list. In the Generals’
last four games the opponents have

started in a man-for-man defense,
but three of them changed to a zone
to stop Supak’s driving. The fourth
remained in a man-for-man set-up
only because it had a 30-point lead.
Supak scored a total of 76 points
in these four games, and 46 of
these came in the first half against
primarily man-for-man defenses.

“Tommy is our best driver,”
says Coach Bob McHenry. “Be-
cause of his driving ability we try
to set him up in one-on-one sit-
uations. We think he can beat

W&L Gains Prestige For Top Debating Team

By C. C. FLIPPEN

Washington and Lee’s de-
bate team is rapidly becoming
recognized as being one of the
top notch in the nation.

Debate Team
Places Fourth

Debating in last Saturday’s Invi-
tational Tournament held at Mt.
Mercy College in Pittsburgh, Wash-
ington and Lee’s debate team placed

 

fourth among thirteen competing
colleges.
Al Eckes and Bill Boardman,

W&L’s affirmative team, posted a
40-0 tournament record. Both Eckes
and Boardman won awards of ex-
cellence.

Judged second among tourna-
ment debaters, Eckes was selected
from a field of fifty-two debaters
representing the thirteen colleges.

Eckes now boasts a team record
of nine consecutive victories. Fin-
ishing two points behind Eckes, Bill
Boardman also won an award.

Losing to the three top teams in
the tournament, Ed Norton and
Steve Smith of the Negative team
posted a 1-3 record.

The debate team finished with an
overall tournament record of 5-3.

Rising almost meteorically over ,
the past year, the team is in a po-
sition today to take on some of the
nation’s most formidable opponents.
In addition to its rapid rise, how-
ever, the breadth of program here
makes it one of the most unusual in
the country.

William Chaffin, director of de-
bate activities at W&L, estimated
that by the end of this semester
“some 50 students will have taken
part in debate and discussions on a
college level, here this year.”

Trains Large Numbers

“We differ quite a bit from other
colleges in this respect.” Chaffin said,
“We are interested in training large
numbers of students, rather than
spending a great deal of time with
just a small group. The average
school has only eight to twelve per-
sons on a team.

“Of course students of greater
ability who are willing to put in
more time on debate work will be
used to a greater extent than others.
However, anyone who is interested,
regardless of ability, can take part

Debate Interest Was Low

When Chaffin first came here more
than a year and a half ago, inter-
collegiate debate at W&L was in a
lethargic state. Debate activity was
kept alive by only a very small
group of interested students. With
hard work and driving spirit Chaf-
fin built the team to its present size.

W&L Wins State Award

For the second year in a row
W&L has captured the state cham-
pionship in debating. In various
tournaments throughout the year,
six students have won _ individual
awards for excellence in debating.

for the Wasps, with 29 and 14
points respectively.

In the second half, the Generals
sank 23 of 43 shots from the floor,
for a respectable 53.5 per cent. For
the game, they made 37 of 78, 47.4
per cent. The Wasps hit 27 of 69, 39.1
per cent.

W. and L.’s 18 point margin came
from the 10-basket edge in field
goals. From the foul line, Emory
and Henry hit 27 of 33, as opposed to
W. and L.’s 25 of 28.

The Wasps picked off four re-
bounds more than the Generals,
48-44. High man in that department
was the visitors’ Leonard Shelor,
who pulled in 14. Monier led the
Generals with nine, followed by
Ide’s eight. Fauber and Tom Su-
pak each had five.

Judged by the score, this was
not a defensive ball game. But
many of the Generals’ points in
the second half came on layups
after they stole the ball from the
Wasps at mid-court, or on a fast
break after a rebound.

Saturday night’s game was the
last one in Doremus gym for seniors
Ide and Monier.

The Generals closed their season
Monday night at Norfolk, in a con-
test with the Norfolk College Mon-
archs. They went into the contest
with a 6-11 record.

All Frosh. Will Be NFU’s

(Continued from page 2)

who is and who isn’t NFU. For a sol-
id year everyone would be in doubt
about who they could associate with
without being astigmatized .

I don’t want to deal, however, on
the social problem involved in such
a move. I would rather consider
some of the physical aspects of the
question.

“Where would all those sopho-
mores live?” I hear students asking.

Not wishing to take sides either
for or against, I offer the faculty
this solution to that problem. You
can save all the Saran-wrap used on
the science building, and also re-
quire all freshmen to conserve their
shirt-bags throughout the year.
Then a tent-city could be put up
on the front lawn to accommodate
rushees during that hectic week.

This will also solve the problem
of finding rooms of rushees for
the upperclassmen, for they can see
everyone at a glance. And then af-
ter rush week all the NFU’s can be
suffocated in their sleep by collaps-
ing the tents, thus eliminating an
undesirable element once and for
all.

If this sounds a little ridiculous,
let me remind you that this is the
season for the ridiculous.

As for myself I find that the fac-
ulty peition pushers have sensed
a problem but have come up with
a short-sighted solution. Why, I ask,
should the privilege of fraternity
membership be offered to sopho-
mores once it has been wrested
away from freshmen?

It seems that here is a chance to
strengthen the fraternity system by
allowing only seniors to join. This
would do away with all the imma-
turity extant in fraternities, and

would place the house on a level
with ODK and Phi Beta Kappa.

If the faculty restricts fraternity
membership to seniors then they
can be sure that only responsible
men would be allowed to join in the
social circle of fraternal brother-
hood. Gone would be the childish,
adolescent elements of fraternity
life, and what would remain would
be a group of mature students who
have entered into a lasting relation-
ship based on sound judgment rath-
er than self-seeking motivations.

And so, faculty, I ask you to re-
consider. Don’t be satisfied with
simple solutions, but get down to the
real problem. Don’t eliminate fresh-
man rush, eliminate freshmen. Don’t
destroy the NFU stigma, destroy the
NFU. You have a chance to do
something here, gentlemen. I hope
you get it done.

WITH ANOTHER crisis possibly
rising for the fraternities, it is
again opportune to bring up the
subject of a central purchasing

money to compensate for any loss
of revenue encountered in an al-
teration of the fraternity system.
Why not look into it?

New IBM ‘No. 1620’ Computer
To Be Kept Busy On Research

Undergraduate instruction and
student and faculty research will
have top priority in the workload of
Washington and Lee’s new IBM 1620
computer, according to President
Fred C. Cole.

The computer—first of its kind in
a Virginia college—was installed at
the university in late January for
teaching, research and administra-
tive functions. Work with the com-
puter will enable students to be-
come acquainted firsthand with the
techniques of computing and its ap-
plications to science, the social sci-
ences and modern management in
business and industry.

Special quarters, including new
classroom space, have been com-
pleted for the machine in the build-
ing next to the print shop.

Speedy Machine

A fully transistorized unit, the
computer—known as a 1620 Data
Processing System—will be operated
by J. Baine Fox, W&L’s supervisor
of statistical records. The unit is
capable of handling arithmetical
instructions and repetitive tasks at
rates of speed up to millionths of a
second. Detailed and time-consum-
ing computations involved in study
and research as well as administra-
tive functions will be aided by the
computer.

One university class has begun an
experimental study of the operation
of the 1620 and the philosophy of
computing. Computer applications
are being related to the class’s
study. Special courses in operation
and programming for students will
be expanded next fall. Computer
programs will be incorporated into
course work by individual profes-
sors.

Classes for Faculty

Faculty members and administra-
tive officers were introduced to the
computer during a two-week course
in theory, programming and opera-
tion. The course was taught by
Robert Smith, a systems representa-
tive of IBM. Faculty seminars on
the computer's role in a university
were conducted by Dr. James W.
Sweeney, director of the Tulane
University Computer Center.

Student research utilizing the
computer will be done under facul-

 

ty supervision. Some projects cur-
rently under the sponsorship of the
Robert E, Lee Research Fund, es-
tablished at Washington and Lee in
1960 to foster student-faculty re-
search in all departments, will be
programmed for the 1620.

The computer will be used for
such projects as the analyisis of
data being compiled from research
in th euniversity’s department of
psychology. A study of behavioral
patterns after exposure to radiation
is underway in that department.

Class problems in mechanics, elec-
tricity and optics in the department
of physics will be programmed for
the machine. Special research in the
departments of chemistry, geology,
biology, engineering, mathematics
and in the School of Commerce and
Administration also will be alloted
machine time.

Preliminary classroom instruction
for students will include work in
Fortran, a synthetic language re-
quired for writing programs for a
computer, and in SPS, a symbolic
programming system which is an
IBM code for use in preparing prob-
lems for the unit.

A program applications library
will be set up at the university’s
computer building for future ref-

 

erence. New programs written by
students and faculty members will
be catalogued for use at later dates.

“It will take us several months
to get a fully effective computer
program started here,” Fox said.
“There are a number of fundamen-
tal steps that must be taught to
those who plan to use the machine
before we can obtain maximum ef-
ficiency.

A Real Time-Saver

“We hope that with the aid of the
1620 computer, Washington and Lee
will be able to stimulate more in-
terest in research by individuals
and groups of students and faculty.
Working time on details can be cur-
tailed by using the computer, and
thus more thorough and far reach-
ing research in varied fields can
be accomplished,” he added.

In addition to instruction and re-
search, the new computer will
broaden the scope of work and in-
crease the efficiency and speed of
the university’s original IBM equip-
ment. Certain reports, registration
details and other administrative

needs will be programmed for the
1620 in an effort to supplement the
present processing and _tabulating
units.

Mollegen Says Existentialist
Thinkers Seek Life In Death

By STEVE SMITH

Theologian Albert Molle-
gen, speaking Wednesday
night in Lee Chapel, called
man’s situation as a stranger
on earth “a most embarrass-
ing predicament.”

Mollegen, the 41st speaker
for Washington and Lee’s
Seminars in Literature, lectur-
ed on “Albert Camus: Facing
Death and the Absurd.” The
basis of modern existentialism
and of Camus’ works, said
Mollegen, is the absurdity that
man does not know what he is,
and cannot know what he shall

be.

Existentialists find meaning in life,
in the face of the absurd, by adopt-
ing heroism as the weapon against
meaninglessness. They face the fact
of death and its radical termination
and say that “all man’s being is
being toward death.” Only by real-
izing the human predicament and

 

facing it in this way can a man be
truly human and real. “Qualitative
living comes only by dying—by fac-
ing death,” and negation is in this
light an affirmation.

Man must face reality because in
the modern world he has nothing to
lean upon except his own resources
This situation is the result of the
existentialist determination that
“God is dead.” Science has killed
God, and made man self-centered
and reliant on himself instead of
God.

“A Hollow Victory”

On this Mollegen, a noted apolo-
gist for Christianity, commented, “If
God is dead, man is dead.” He found
only meaninglessness in defying God
and the universe, and the existential-
ist victory he called a hollow one.
This “victory” is merely the accep-
ance of being dead heroically.

Mollegen quoted extensively from
The Stranger by Camus in order to
establish the starting point of athe-
ism and agnosticism, as well as the
“heart of French existentialism.”

At the end of the book the main
character finds, as must the exis-
tentialist, that death is a liberation—
not because it is anything passing,

 

Davidson Students And Faculty
Vote For College’s Integration

By SHANNON JUNG
The integration of students of all races and nationalities
into the student body of Davidson College has been recom-
mended to its Board of Trustees by the College’s students and

faculty.

 

for it is complete—but because it is
a bad thing which relieves man of
a worse one.

He also used the illustration of
the mythical Sisyphus, doomed for-
ever to roll a boulder up a hill, but
never to make the crest because the
rock always rolled down again. In
spite of the fact that he never suc-
ceeds, Sisyphus is a conqueror be-
caus he accepts the fact that he
cannot succeed and continues to
struggle determinedly.

A Symptom

Two strands, said Mollegen, both
containing the problems of the 19th
Century, have resulted in existen-
tialism and Communism. Existen-
tialism is the heroic evidence of the
sickness of western civilization, as
is shown by the beatniks and angry
young men.

Communism too, it appears, will
have to go through the sickness
since it contains as does existential-
ism all problems articulated in the
arts, literature, and behavior of men.
Mollegen pointed out that beatniks
are evident today in Moscow.

The communists have already said
that God is dead, that man does not
need him because he can have utopia
on earth in the place of heaven. But
unless, sad Mollegen, they can an-
swer the question, “What is the
meaning of individual existence?”
they may be doomed.

Existentialism has raised this
question already, and attempted to
face it; but the communists, with
their utopian answers, have only
postponed it.

The theologian illustrated with the
metaphor of an equilateral triangle

(Continued on page four)

 

At the Davidson Board’s recent™*
mid-term meeting, student and fac-
ulty petitions to integrate were re-
ferred to the Trustees’ Executive
Committee.

In a student opinion poll conducted
jointly by the student government
and newspaper, 53 per cent of the
voters favored integration. Student
Council President George Trask
stated, “Recently the faculty re-
solved that no qualified student
should be denied admission because
of race or nationality. We feel that
now is the opportune moment to
express student opinion.”

A faculty poll had shown 79 per
cent of faculty members favoring in-
tegration.

Vote To Admit Congolese

Last year Davidson’s racial bar-
rier was lowered partly when their
Trustees voted to admit several
well-qualified Congolese students.
No qualified Congolese applicants
took advantage of this opportunity,
but present plans provide for at
least two Africans next term. The
student body has already raised
funds to support a Congolese.

In 1959 the Davidson Trustees
voted that it was “not in the best
interests” of Davidson to integrate.

Whereas in 1959 the Davidson
Board torpedoed integration hopes
by the vote of a special committee,
this year the subject is being studied
by a different group. President of
the Board J. McDowell Richards
said that this move is an indication
that the Trustees are not simply
seeking the same negative answer.
Richards commented that he was not
surprised that the polls favored in-
tegration; rather, he said, he was
surprised that the poll was not more
one-sided in favor of integration.

No One Surprised

President of the college D. Grier
Martin also said that he had felt
there would be a majority favoring
integration in the 1962 poll.

However ,in a 1959 poll only 46
per cent of the student body favored
mixing.

The Davidsonian, campus news-
paper, admitted disappointment that
the petitions have merely been re-
ferred away rather than acted on,
and hoped that the action would
produce new progress. Its reason for
this hope was that the Trustees
should not be “dragging their feet
at a time when Davidson should be
seizing the leadership in the
South...”

Troubadours Rebuilding
Old Stage For “Othello”

The upcoming Troubadour pro-
duction of “Othello” is beginning
to take final shape. Twenty-five act-
ors and actresses are rehearsing
nightly under the supervision of
Troub director Dr. Cecil D. Jones,
preparing for the March 14 opening
night.

Apart from the acting rehearsals,
much technical work is being done.
Prof. Robert Stewart and senior
Gene Johnson are busy composing

Cravens Leads In Physics

A Washington and Lee sophomore
has been awarded a copy of the
Handbook of Chemistry and Physics
for the highest average in his first
semester of college physics.

Jere D. Cravens of Bartlesville,
Okla., was presented the book Fri-
day during his regular physics lec-
ture course by Dr. J. Thomas Ratch-
ford, of the university’s physics de-
partment. The purpose of the an-
nual award is to stimulate interest
in the sciences through student
competition. The prize is given by

cal style of Shakespeare’s time, ac-
cording to Mr. Stewart. Instead, the
music will be contemporary and will
create sound effects to reinforce the
mood of the stage action.

There will be a prologue, entre-
acte, and at least five other inter-
ludes. W&L students will record the
themes under Mr. Stewart’s direc-
tion to be replayed during the per-
formance.

Special Stage Setting

The stage setting is almost com-
pleted. It is sparse and simple, de-
signed to give a “Moorish flavor and
sombre background to the tragic
action,’ said Dr. Jones. There is one
set, so each scene will be indicated
only by the presence or absence of
furniture and by what the charac-
ters themselves say.

The color of the setting has been
kept purposely neutral to display
the colorful costumes to better ad-
vantage.

The forestage has been built out
from the main stage which projects
six feet into the audience area. It
will be used for soliloquies, for two-
character scenes, and also as an ex-
tension of the mainstage when the

A Look At The South

Today we begin a new series of articles on the South and
the Sixties with an essay by Dr. Allen Ragan of the political
science department on the urbanization of the South.

 

Washington and Lee has always been a strongly Southern
school, and despite the present wide variety of geographical
origins of her present student body, she remains so. We think
that the University should concern herself with her role in a
fast-changing South. The articles in the new Friday series will
address some of the leading problems and questions posed by
this era of change. Will the South become indistinguishable
from the rest of the United States? It not, what distinctive
characteristics will she retain in the future? What sort of role
will the South play in politics and economics? In the cultural
life of the nation? These are some of the questions our contri-
butors will try to answer.

We hope the series will stimulate discussion on this sub-
ject in the University. We will comment on specific issues from
time to time in our editorials and columns as the series progres-
ses. We invite the student body to agree or differ with us and
with our distinguished guest columnists—either by letters-to-
the editor or columns of their own. We would like to see this
series become a two-way affair.

Our thanks go to Dr. Ragan for his excellent article that
is published today and to the other professors who have con-
sented to contribute their time and effort to this inquiry.

Wrestling And Swimming

Monday night’s 16-12 win over Virginia closed a highly-
successful season for the wrestling team, as they finished with
a 7-3 season record against a very tough schedule.

Coach Dick Miller deserves a pat on the back for his work
with the team this year—and in past years, for wrestling con-
tinues to be one of W&L’s strongest sports under his coaching.

Coach Norris Eastman’s swimmers also turned in an excel-
lent season against equally tough competition. It appears that
the tradition of powerful swimming teams at W&L that was
kept up under Athletic Director Cy Twombly will continue un-
der Mr. Eastman.

We think it proves that given coaches of the caliber of Mr.
Miller and Mr. Eastman, W&L teams can more than hold their
own against the best in this area.

 

Writers-In-Residence

For some reason never fully revealed to the student body,
Washington and Lee has apparently given up the concept of
“professors in residence.”

Not too many years ago, names like Katherine Anne Porter
and Arnold Toynbee were included in our faculty roster. No
longer is this the case, and we find the situation somewhat re-
grettable.

To those arguing that visiting professors are no more than
prestigious figureheads who actually add nothing to the student
intellectual community, we would like to point out the promin-
ent and highly desirable roles played by two professors in resi-
dence at neighboring Hollins College.

Both John Aldridge and William Golding are presently
employed by Hollins. They take a great pride in the life
of the college, making lectures, appearing before classes,
and generally adding to the intellectual climate of the student
body.

It is our purpose to raise only one question: why have we
abandoned what appears to be a program advantageous to our
student body?

We understand that the English novelist and critic Colin
Wilson, who appeared here during the first semester, was high-
ly enthusiastic over Washington and Lee, and expressed a de-
sire to accept a professor in residence position here.

Apparently, our faculty squelched this idea on the grounds
that Mr. Wilson was too outspoken and controversial.

Mr. Wilson, a gifted speaker and certainly a competent
artist, would have been a major asset to Washington and Lee,
adding not only prestige but also intellectual stimulation to a
university lacking in both areas.

The South In The Sixtie-—A New Series

 

Urbanization: Problems And Results

By DR. ALLEN RAGAN

Associate Professor of
Political Science

The South, like the rest of the
United States and the rest of the
world for that matter, is confront-
ed with the varied problems result-
ing from urbanization following
World War II. Of course, the South
welcomes this urbanization because
it is a consequence of an expand-
ing commercialization and indus-
tralization. As is well known, the
low per capita income and the low
standard of living which long
prevailed in the South are attribut-
ed to an unbalanced economy—a
case of too much exported raw ma-
terial and too much agriculture, a lot
of which is of the marginal type.

There has been wholesale migra-
tion of rural people into the urban
and metropolitan areas of the North,
East and far West. The same has
happened in the South and is stim-
ulated particularly by change in
southern agriculture. A  consider-
able number of farm workers have
become superfluous because of the
mechanization of farm equipment.
Agriculture has been diversified so
that fewer row crops are produc-
ed and there is far more cattle and
dairy farming. The soil bank has
taken land out of production as has
reforestation. In some areas, such as
Georgia, large paper companies have
purchased huge tracts of land and
destroyed all dwellings in them. The
decline of agriculture and the in-
crease in manufacturing is indicated
by the fact that only 17 per cent of
workers in Georgia make their liv-
ing from farming, while 25 per cent
are employed in manufacturing.
Those becoming reemployed in agri-
culture not only seek jobs outside
the South but also within it.

Space does not permit a listing

of population gains during the dec-
ade of the 1950’s in southern metro-
politan areas, but a few examples
will indicate the significance of the
growth. The Atlanta area increased
40 per cent; its million population
is a result of “a lot of planning, pro-
motion, and a remarkable civic spirit
that did not recognize obstacles
where the welfare and well-being

   

Dr. Ragan

Is sectionalism disappearing?
of the section were involved.” Hous-
ton’s increase was 54 per cent,
Memphis’ 30 per cent, Miami 89 per
cent, New Orleans 27 per cent, New-
port News 45 per cent, Orlando 124
per cent, Tampa-St.Petersburg 89
per cent, Winston-Salem 30 per
cent, Little Rock 24 per cent, Rich-
mond 25 per cent, Savannah 24 per-
cent, and Mobile 36 per cent.

Cities are faced with more or less
the same problems, and those in the
South are no exception. Perhaps

 

 

first on any list for core cities is

finances. Because of the exodus
to the suburbs of both people and
business, down-town property val-
ues have declined alarmingly. This
results in declining tax revenue
while the cost of city services has
increased sharply. It means other
things too, especially urban blight
with its accompanying problems of
law enforcement and welfare ser-
vices. Moreover, as the more ener-
getic and prosperous citizens move
to the suburbs, their places are
taken by the less capable, thus caus-
ing a deficiency in civic leadership.
There are other problems __ too:
housing, human _ relations, traffic
control, transportation, water sup-
ply, waste disposal.

The Cities’ Problem

Since urban areas in all sections
are generally under-represented in
our state legislatures and their re-
quests for assistance frequently ig-
nored, cities increasingly turn to the
national government for aid in
housing, slum clearance, urban re-
newal, hospitalization, and airport
construction. This accounts for the
lobbying of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors and the National Municipal
Association for the proposed fed-
eral department of Housing and
Urban Affairs.

Georgia supplies a classic example
of urban under-representation in
state legislatures. Georgia is becom-
ing urbanized at a fast rate. How-
ever, it is “the country boys” that
rule the state. In the lower house
the eight largest counties have three
representatives each, the next thirty
in population have two each and the
one hundred and twenty-one coun-
ties with small populations have one
each.

One might assume that, just as
the South has become more urban-
ized, it would become more liberal

in politics. But this has not been
the case, certainly not in presiden-
tial elections. With some variations
a long range curve indicates that
Republican voting strength has been
rising since 1944; in 1960, forty-two
of the South’s largest cities went
Republican. It must be noted, how-
ever, that race, religious and anti-
organized labor sentiments were
significant factors. Although it is
now quite respectable to be a Re-
publican, especially in those towns
where former Yankees now manage
important businesses, a two-party
South is not yet a reality.

The Negro Vote

No discussion of the Urban South
should omit some reference to the
growing importance of the Negro
in politics. Today the Negro problem
in the South is essentially an urban
one because it is from the cities that
Negro leadership comes in the
struggle for rights—civil and politi-
cal. Up to this time the more im-
portant gains have resulted from
court action, sit-ins, and bus strikes.
But there is impressive evidence in-
dicating that, aided by a sympa-
thetic administration in Washing-
ton, future gains will come from
concerted action to enable the Ne-
groes to register and vote. If suc-
cessful, the day may not be far dis-
tant when Negroes will hold import-
ant offices in Southern cities and
even seats in Congress.

For years now commentators have
been talking and writing about “The
New South.” Now they are telling
us that the south is at long last
“moving into the main stream of
American life.” If this be true, as
I think it is, and if the historic sec-
tionalism and parochialism of the
South is really being diluted, it is
largely a consequence of the urban-
ization of southern society.

 

 

The Twist

By STEVE HENRY

Did you know that the Twist
was “a valid manifestation of the
Age of Anxiety—an outward mani-
festation of the anguish, frustration,
and uncertainty of the 60’s, an effort
to release some of the tension which,
if suppressed and buried, could
warp and destroy”?

Neither did we until we read an
article by Washington and Lee’s own
Dr. Marshall Fishwick in the cur-
rent Saturday Review of Literature,
available in the library or at any
reputable magazine stand in the
city.

Dr. Fishwick’s article, entitled
“The Twist: Brave New Whirl” (we
tried to think of a worse pun, and
all we could come up with was
“Come on Baby, Do the Fish-wick
Me!”), is apparently intended to
explain the Twist, which really
doesn’t merit much explaining. Or
perhaps it does.

Anyway, Dr. Fishwick explains
everything, and from every possible
angle.

He notes that the Twist has
been described as “barbaric, erotic,
inhuman, and satanic,” but adds that
sex hasn’t got that much to do
with the whole business.

“[m not prepared to say if the
American girl has sacrificed romance
for sex appeal,” he writes, but he
guarantees the reader that sex had
appeal long before the Twist came
along.

What’s going on, then? Huh?

Dr. Fishwick finds the seeds for
the growth of the Twist in the turn
of the century in America, which
brought about “a quickening of the
American tempo...a change from
the protestant ethic to the social
ethic, and from individualism to
togetherness.”

From this upswing in the Ameri-
can tempo developed a new form of
music—Jazz, “an esesntially free and
uninhibited art form which ran
into a stratum of society that put
high values on properness, control,
and restraint.”

(By the way, American jazz is
popular because its rhythms are
linear or horizontal, while European
rhythms are chordal and vertical,
whatever that means. Also, jazz is
“bourbon on the rocks, sleeping on
a foam rubber mattress, a warm
summer day on the beach,” etc., etc.
Did you see “Jazz on a Summer’s
Day?” We did.)

 

Anyway, to get back to the Twist.
Every generation rebels against the

 

Dr. Fishwick’s I nterpretation

“old fogies—everybody over 26,” and
the youth of the 60’s, “anxious to
achieve its own independence and
expression, has adopted new sounds
and gyrations as its red badge of
courage.” Hence the Twist, for bet-
ter or worse.

Of course, this is overlooking the
obvious theological implications of
the dance, which certainly must be
taken into consideration. Dr. Fish-
wick quotes from several 20th cen-
tury theologians, one of whom claims
that modern dancing “is the long-
awaited symbol for the renewed
affirmation we so desperately need.”
Another says, “To Swing is to con-
firm.”

Dr. Fishwick concludes from this
that “to participate in the life of
the Man of the Sixties, we must
open ourselves to the sound of jazz,
and the sight of the Twist.”

The best part about the article
is that there’s no denunciation of
either the dance, or the generation.
Dr. Fishwick admits that he doesn’t
know what to do with the Twist,
and asks “who can draw the line be-
tween experimental and eccentric,
new and neurotic, significant and
silly?”

Well, certainly not the editors of
the Saturday Review, anyway.

Episcopal Church Presents ‘W. aiting For Godot’

 

A Promotion Pitch For Weary

By TRACY HARRINGTON

At 8 p.m. Thursday night in Rob-
ert E. Lee Memorial Episcopal
Church, the curtain rose on a pro-
foundly unprofound play called
“Waiting for Godot.”

Conjured up by a withered little
man who looks like he has tired
blood, “Waiting for Godot” is a
product of the Theatre of the Ab-
surd, a literary movement begun in

France in the 1950’s. The plays of |
the absurd thrive on such things as |
English |

bald sopranos, _ typically
French families, deeply shallow
dialogue, and elevated shoes; in
short, they are absurd. But they are
supposed to be, because what these
throughly enlightened playwrights
are trying to say is that life is ab-
surd, and boring, and meaningless,
confusing—and their delightful bits
of nothingness are all these things.

What Samuel Beckett, author of
“Godot,” has to say is basically what
the rest of the absurd playwrights
have to say. He calls his play a
tragicomedy—-whatever that means.
The plot (using the term very loose-
ly) involves two men—tramps—who
are waiting for someone named
Godot. The tragedy of the play is
that Godot never makes the scene,
but nevertheless the two tramps

must wait until he does—of course,
he never will.

The comedy of the play and a
bit of tragedy, too, lies in the ut-
ter absurdity of the dialogue. It’s
like life. It makes no sense, it’s
drab and maddeningly repetitive.
This, in case the reader is among

 

 

Mrs. Fishwick, Mr. Jennings, Buck James, Greg Taylor in “Godot”
The play continued—but didn’t progress.

the unenlightened,
roariously so.
While the two pathetic little hu-
man beings wait endlessly for the
tardy God, they are visited by a des-
picable character called Pozzo and
his bloody “menial,” Lucky. Who
they are supposed to be isn’t quite

is funny—up-

 

Christians?

clear but this helps make the story
consistently absurd. Pozzo probably
is the devil; that’s as good a guess
as any. His groaning, grunting serv-
ant (Lucky) does, says, and thinks
whatever Pozzo tells him. I’m sure
that means he is deliciously sym-
bolic of something: of what I can’t
imagine.

The play progresses—or I should
say continues—in spurts of nonsen-
sical, disconnected episodes leading
up to absolutely nothing. The cli-
max of a play, by definition, is the
“high point of the action;” the climax
{of “Waiting for Godot,” then, comes
| with the final fall of the curtain, for
thet’s the only really worthwhile
action—high or otherwise—in the
entire thing.

The production staged last night
in the Episcopal Church could prob-
ably be called a success. The actors
did what Beckett surely intended
with various roles. Fortunately, the
total effect of the play was neces-
sarily ommitted as it was presented
in the form of a staged reading.

Mrs. Lucy Fishwick, bedecked in
eyeglasses that looked like a three-
yard expanse of wrought iron grill
work, acted as narrator of the play.
In what proved to be the general
tone of the evening’s performance,

Dennis Gives Views
On We&L Athletics

(EDITOR’S NOTE—The story of Dennis Cooper, the short, graying
man who keeps our jocks clean, is an integral part of the great success
story that is Washington and Lee athletics.

To a greater extent that any other man on campus, Dennis has ob-
served our athletic program from the inside.

In order to obtain his unique viewpoint on this important aspect of
student life, the Ring-tum Phi arranged for a special interview with
Dennis, designed to provide the student body with a behind-the-scene
report on what makes W&L athletics tick.)

By LANCE TARRANCE and STEVE HENRY
Friday Sports Writers

Dennis efficiently turned off his washing machine, and cordially led
us into his spacious office, decorated in a sporting motif, with every pos-

 

sible kind of athletic equipment adorning the walls.

It was hard for us to believe that this man, whose hand is con-
stantly on the pulse of Washington and Lee athletics, had never been in-
terviewed before by a member of the campus newspaper.

When told of the possibility of his story appearing in the Ring-tum
Phi, Dennis flashed an engaging grin and said, “I’ve never read a Ring-tum
Phi in my life. One time they brought me one down with a story on the
basketball team, but I wasn’t too interested.”

We decided we wouldn’t dwell on*

anything too controversial, so we
changed the subject, hoping to get
down to matter of real importance.

Interview

The text of the interview follows,
with occasional comments of our
own thrown in to ellucidate some
of the more complicated answers:

Question: What do you think
about W&L’s undefeated football
season?

Answer: “I’ve never seen a foot-
ball game, or a basketball game,

Dennis Cooper
“...400 jocks a day”

or a lacrosse game, or whatever else
they play around here. All I see is
dirty, grimy clothes.”

He turned and pointed to great
stacks of dirty football equipment,
the remnants of last Saturday’s var-
sity-alumni game.

Wash, Wash, Wash

“Undefeated or defeated, they all
look the same to me. They’re pretty
good boys, but of course I don’t
have anything to do with recruiting.
All I do is wash, wash, wash, and
answer that bell. I don’t have
enough time to get a drink of water
or anything else.”

Question: Do any of the athletes
give you any trouble?

Answer: “Most of the time they’ve
pretty good. Every once in a while
we have a little argument, but they
just get mad and walk off. That’s
all.”

Question: Well, then, what do you
think about the new College Ath-
letic Conference?

Answer: “What conference? I
don’t know what you're talking
about.”

(We decided at this point to
change the subject, so we started
talking about the equipment on
hand.)

Socks, etc

Question: Do you have a pretty
hard time with equipment turnov-
er down here?

Answer: “You better believe it.
This place is like a grocery store, we
have to replace so much stuff. I
figure I handle about 400 dirty socks
and jocks a day. That’s a lot of
socks and jocks, vou know.”

Question: Well, what’s the favorite
item that students like to check
out?

Answer: “Basketballs, mostly, and
handballs. But people check them
out for 24 hours, and don’t return
them for two or three weeks. I let
Coach Miller take care of that kind,
though. There are a lot of things
we don’t have to worry about at all.
Take those archery bows, for in-
stance. I’ve been here four years,
and never checked them out, prob-
ably because they’ve been broken.
They probably were given to us
broken.”

Fred Walker

Question: Dennis, we see Fred
Walker in here a good bit of the
time. What part does he play in jour
job?

Answer: “Oh, Fred doesn’t come
in here except every once in a while
to throw a towel at me. That’s all.
He doesn’t have anything much to
do with my department. As for
Fred’s dog, I just don’t like mutts. I
can’t afford to feed my family, much
less a dog.”

At this point, a washing mach-
ine started roaring, and a student
began ringing the bell. We realized
that Dennis had given up one of his
valuable rest breaks for the bene-
fit of our readers.

We left him alone, arguing with
a student over a towel—a forgotten
man, devoted to keeping W&L ath-
letes clean and pure.

posted a 7-3 record, including a win
over the University of Virginia last
Monday.

The team also elected its “most
valuable member,” and the “out-
standing freshman” award. Both
these awards will be announced at
the wrestling banquet next month.

One Starter Lost

Only Sandy Mersereau will be lost
to the wrestlers next year, and coach
Dick Miller said that the next year’s

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Slater Says Students Prepared
For Parties By New Shenandoah

By HOWARD SLATER

A golden opportunity has recent-
ly arisen for students here to get
in at the beginning of a good thing.
This is in reference to the latest
issue of Shenandoah, dedicated to
and primarily about Robert Graves,
the “up-and-coming” poet. Shenan-
doah is one of the worthwhile ac-
tivities here. Mr. Day, to use typical
Ring-tum Phiish prose, has done a
very commendable job.

In the foreword to the issue, Mr.
Day commented that “we ought to
know more about Robert Graves.”
He didn’t say why, however, so I
would like to point out how students
would benefit from knowing more
about Graves. I am speaking from a
practical point of view, of course, for
this is the reason we are at college.

Robert Graves’ reputation as a
poet is increasing at the present
time. It is more than likely that he
will soon be regarded as the fore-
most English language poet of
our time, superseding T. S. Eliot,
whose reputation is declining even
as Graves’ increases. This is precise-
ly the forecast which W. H. Auden
and G. N. Fraser made in their
articles in Shenandoah.

The Practical Consequences

Now the practical consequences of
this development are as follows:
Graves, and not Eliot, will be a more
potent topic of conversation at all
cocktail parties-to-be. Cocktail
parties and other institutions of
small talk will inevitably play an
important part in our post-graduate
existences.

Whether or not this is desirable is
a moot point; cocktail parties seem
to be here to stay, and the best must
be made of an inevitable evil. As
adults, we will still be required to
be nice chaps, swell fellows, and
sharp guys. But there will be no
combos at these parties to cover
up for empty minds and_ blank
tongues. Therefore, we will also be
required to be decent conversation-
alists.

It is obvious, then, that he who
knows what it is best to speak
about will have an advantage over
he who does not. It will be best in
the future to speak about Robert

Graves. This then is the practical
benefit to be gained from reading
Shenandoah, The magazine is a use-
ful introduction to what very prob-
ably will be an important social
tool.

It is irrelevant, of course, that the
rise of Graves will have a salutary
effect on the tone of small talk at
cocktail parties; this being so be-
cause his poetry is straight-forward
and down to earth, unlike the ob-
securities of Eliot, which are so con-
ducive to promoting the snotty psue-
doties of the more agressive and
ostentatious party-ers.

It is also irrelevant that this is
truly a fine issue of Shenandoah, and
that Graves is a really fine poet with
or without cocktail parties to cele-
brate the fact. We know what IS
relevant; so let us resolve to grab
up that magazine, for the right rea-
son, of course.

* * ae

While we're on a reviewing kick,
mention ought to be made of an-
other worthwhile literary enterprise:
namely, the writings of Washington
and Lee’s regional humorist, Thorns
Craven. It is rare when one is
gifted enough to perceive what is
pompous, hypocritical, and ridicu-
lous—and to be able to ridicule
them so that they appear funny
and not simply pathetic or ugly. This
is what is known as a lesson in
perspective. Thorns is capable of
providing this lesson, and for that
reason Res Ipsa Loquitor ought to
be required reading.

EC Votes Suggested

Assimilation Change

Late each night after hours of
studying, or equally tiring road
trips, a sweater-clad group may be
found in either of Lexington’s open
restaurants. Bleary-eyed, _ tieless,
and coatless, this coterie is guilty of
a misdemeanor; they aren’t con-
ventionally dressed. In Monday
night’s meeting, a tie vote of the
Executive Committee failed to pass
the Assimilation Committee’s sug-
gested conventional dress change
which would relax the ruling after
9:00 p.m.

The E.C. felt that such relaxed
changes would open the flood gates
to the destruction of conventional
dress. Given an inch the student
body would demand more.

Following a series of complaints,
the Assimilation Committee origin-
aly proposed that upperclassmen be
allowed the same privilege awarded
to freshmen, who are allowed non-
conventional dress in the Co-op.
This change was sought by those
upperclassmen living in dormitories
who are prohibited such casual at-
tire. Realizing the impossibility of
knowing which upperclassmen lived
in the dorms, Assimilation Commit-
tee president Steve Rutledge pro-
posed that the conventional dress
not be required after 9:00 p.m. Rut-
ledge feels that no drastic results
would follow, in fact he stated that
his job would be much easier if
certain rules were revamped.

So you still can’t grab a quick
hamburger without putting on your
tie and coat. With the EC ruling,
all those not properly attired—at
any time—will be prime targets for
an appearance before the committee.

Rutledge again voiced his objec-
tions to the commonly accepted atti-
tude that the Assimilation Commit-
tee lies in wait for violators. The
circumstances are always considered
before a recommendation, or a
warning is issued, he said.

Review Of “Waiting For Godot”

(Continued from page 2)

she monotoned her way through an
introduction and sporadic terse com-
mentaries completely irrelevant to
the play. She did an adequate job
of reading the stage directions—at
least the audience had no trouble
understanding the meaning of her
lines, which is more than can be
said for the others.

Professor John Jennings and
James Boatwright portrayed the two
tramps, Gogo and Didi, respectively.
Most of their dialogue consisted of
forgetting what they just said and
misunderstanding what they remem-
bered. This writer came to appre-
ciate Gogo, and finally to adore him.
The reason for this adoration lies in
the fact that Gogo kept wanting to
go—and I found myself praying that
he would go, take Didi with him,
and put an end to a painful exper-
ience. Both professors made an ad-
mirable attempt at creating some-
thing worthwhile and enjoyable out
of Beckett’s characters—and they
almost succeeded.

Some of Gogo’s lines really were
priceless . He said, for instance:
“This is becoming really insignifi-
cant.” I agreed wholeheartedly.
Later, he remarked, “I’m getting
bored.” Again, Gogo and I saw eye

Pozzo, loudly and diabolically in-
sinuated by Buck James. He did,
at least, make an impressive appear-
ance on the stage, and succeeded in
making Pozzo even more revolting
than Beckett intended.

Pozzo’s servant, Lucky, carried out
his role with a real display of dra-
matic abilities. He acted with finesse
and, all in all, gave the character
more than it was worth. Lucky was
played by Gregory Taylor.

The final person in the play was
Boy played by Robert Goolrick. A
charming and talented 12-year-old,
Goolrick added a refreshing touch of
normality and decency to the play.
Although his part was minor, the
boy did a lot for the production.

Directing the play was Episcopal
chaplain Wm. J. Schneider. How he
happened to choose “Waiting for
Godot” as the answer to a church
social for sophisticates is puzzling.
As art, the play is dubious; as a pro-
motion pitch for weary Christians,
it is a total failure.

As I left the scene of the Thursday
night fiasco, I admired the actors
and the director for their efforts to
give Beckett's irritating garbage a
bit of value. I’m sure they did thier
best—and, as I said before, they
almost succeeded.

God was the base, and man and so-

cases become the base, man an arm,
and God has often disappeared.

Dr. Ross Borden, who introduced

THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GOLDER

Serer
eee:

The academic world, as we all know, is loaded with dignity and
ethics, with lofty means and exalted ends, with truth and beauty.
In such a world a heinous thing like faculty raiding —colleges en-
ticing teachers away from other colleges—is not even thinkable.

However, if the dean of one college happens—purely by
chance, mind you—to run into a professor from another college,
and the professor happens to remark—just in passing, mind you

—that he is discontented with his present position, why, what’s
wrong with the dean making the professor an offer? Like the
other afternoon, for instance, Dean Sigafoos of Gransmire
Polytech, finding himself in need of a refreshing cup of oolong,
dropped in quite by chance at the Discontented Professors
Exchange where he discovered Professor Stuneros from the
English Department of Kroveny A and M sitting over a pot of
lapsang soochong and shrieking “I Hate Kroveny A and M!”
Surely there was nothing improper in the dean saying to the
professor, “Leander, perhaps you'd like to come over to us. I
think you'll find our shop A-OK.”

(It should be noted here that all English professors are named
Leander, just as all psychics professors are named Fred. All
sociology professors are, of course, named Myron, all veterinary
medicine professors are named Rover, and all German professors
are named Hansel and Gretel. All deans, are, of course, named
Attila.)

But I digress. Leander, the professor, has just been offered a
job by Attila, the dean, and he replies, “Thank you, but I
don’t think so.”

“And I don’t blame you,” says Attila, stoutly. “I under-
stand Kroveny has a fine little library.’

“Well, it’s not too bad,’’ says Leander. ‘We have 28 volumes
in all, including a mint copy of Nancy Drew, Girl Detective.”

“Very impressive,” says Attila. “Us now, we have 36 million
volumes, including all of Shakespeare’s first folios and the Dead
Sea Scrolls.”

“Golly whiskers,” says Leander.

“But of course,” says Attila, “you don’t want to leave
Kroveny where, I am told, working conditions are tickety-boo.”

“Oh, they’re not too bad,” says Leander. “I teach 18 hours
of English, 11 hours of optometry, 6 hours of forestry, coach the
fencing team, and walk Prexy’s cat twice a day.”

“A full, rich life,” says Attila. “At our school you’d be some-
what less active. You’d teach one class a week, limited to four A
students. As to salary, you’d start at $50,000 a year, with
retirement at full pay upon reaching age 29.”

  
    

   

 

wh fheny’s cot Youce 9 day?

“Sir,” says Leander, “your offer is most fair but you must
understand that I owe a certain loyalty to Kroveny.”

“T not only understand, I applaud,” says Attila. “But before
you make a final decision, let me tell you one thing more. We
supply Marlboro cigarettes to our faculty—all you want at all
times.”

“Gloryosky!”’ cries Leander, bounding to his feet. “You mean
Marlboro, the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste—
Marlboro, the cigarette with better makin’s— Marlboro that
comes to you in pack or box— Marlboro that gives you such a
lot to like?”

“Yep,” says Attila, “that’s the Marlboro I mean.”

“T am yours,” cries Leander, wringing the Dean’s hand.
“Where do I sign?”

“At the quarry,” replies Attila. “Frankly, we don’t trust
paper contracts any more. We chisel them in marble.”

The purpose of the organization is to recog-

scholarship, liberal culture, and good character.

Since its founding fifty-one years ago, Gamma of
Virginia has conferred membership on students with

outstanding academic records.

Originating with ten people, one of whom was Dr.

EC Keeps Publications Board Representative
Leon Bibb Signed For Friday Concert Of Springs

Springs W. eekend ‘To Feature
Folk Music Festival

BY ANDY NEA

Managing Editor
Leon Bibb, one of the Nation’s leading ballad singers, will
appear at the Friday night concert of Spring Dances. Bibb will
perform with another group that will be announced at a later

date.

Bibb’s appearance is part of the Folk Music Festival that

has been planned for Spring D

ances this year. Instead of the

usual dance and concert, two concerts will be held this year.

Bibb has been described as one*
of the top interpreters of folksongs
in the country. In addition, he brings
to the stage a magnificent voice.

Leon Bibb is now in his early
thirties, and was born in Louisville,
Ky. He attended Louisville Munici-
pal College for two years where he
was a featured soloist in the glee
club.

Following a tour in the army, he
went to New York and began his
musical eareer. During this time, he
was cast in the Rogers and Ham-
merstein-Irving Berlin production
of “Annie Get Your Gun.”

Leaves Broadway

After leaving Broadway, he joined
the touring company of “Finian’s
Rainbow.” He then returned to

Broadway to appear in several mu-} y=

sicals.

Although Bibb sings a great many
folk songs, as if he had lived with
them all his life, he is not primarily
a folk singer. He has had a varied
career in the entertainment world.

He has sung in theatres, night
clubs, small informal halls, and in
big open air festivals. He uses his
well trained voice to add feeling and
expression to his preformances.

Critics Hail

Critics have hailed him as a top
interpreter of folk music. They say
that his voice is both moving and
flexible.

Bibbs appearance at W&L is part
of the continuing trend to provide
more versitile entertainment for the
student body. Dance Board Presi-
dent, Steve Galef, stated that the
Springs Weekend with the folk fes-
tival is an experiment. Many colleges
and universities of the East have had
such programs and they have proved
to be highly successful.

Two Concerts
This year, the two concerts will
be held in Doremus Gymnasium
from 8 to 10 p.m. in the evening.
The Dance Board plans to arrange
the gym in such a manner as to
provide better atmosphere. A plat-
form will be extended out into the
audience so that the singers may
have more freedom of movement.
Special Lighting
Special lighting effects have been
planned. This will add to the theme
of the Folk Music Festival.

 

 

Bibb has signed a contract to re-
cord on Columbia-Masterworks rec-
ords. This company has some of the
finest entertainers in the world.

Bibb has recently appeared in a
straight acting role in “Flight into
Egypt.” He has also played in “Liv-
ing the Life,” a musical version of
Huckelberry Finn.

He has appeared on many tele-
vision shows including the NBC
spectacular “Bloomer Girl,” ABC’s
“Music for a Summer Night,” and
most recently on the Ed Sullivan
Show.

“He is the possessor of one of
the most beautiful voices and he
devotes it to songs that mean a great
deal to him.”

EC Discusses Constitution;
Approves Several Articles

By KEN LANE

Associate Editor
In its review of the Student Body Constitution Sunday and
Monday of this week, the EC voted down the proposed amend-
ment that the Publications Board Representative be eliminated

from the committee.

The amendment was considered in*®

the form of two alternatives:

First, that the Publications Repre-
sentative be replaced by a member
from the junior class to be chosen
in the class election.

This was voted down, 7 for and
5 against, thus failing to get the
necessary two-thirds majority.

Those in favor were Ogilvie, Paul,
McThenia, Robrecht, Bishop, Chris-
tian, and Suttle.

Those against were Galef, Rob-
erts, Page, Boiarsky, and Ireland.

The second alternative was that
the Publications Representative be
replaced by a member from the
student body-at-large, to be chos-
en in the general election.

This also received a vote of 7 for
and 5 against, thus failing to pass.

Those in favor were Ireland, Paul,
McThenia, Robrecht, Bishop, Chris-
tian, and Suttle.

 

IFC Votes Down Scien Weekend Plan

By TUESDAY WRITERS

A proposal from the IFC’s So-
cial Committee that would elimi-
nate fraternity sponsored combos
during the hours of the Friday
University dances, failed to pass
the IFC by a 7-9 vote in last
night’s regular meeting.

The proposal was drawn up by
the Social Committee in conjunc-
tion with the Dance Board.

It came as the result of a two
and one half hour session held
Monday afternoon, and the pro-
posal was an effort to bring a bet-
liaison between the University
Dance Board and the IFC.

Discussion in last night’s lengthy
meeting of the IFC revealed that
the IFC did not favor such a pro-
posal, but it was decided that the
IFC would favor such a proposal
on a yearly basis.

‘This Year Only’ Basis

In an amendment to the propos-
al made by the Social Committee,
George Honts, Delt president, sug-
gested that the proposal be chang-
ed to a “this year only” basis,
thus keeping the proposal from
becoming a permanent part of the
IFC Constitution.

Honts’ amendment passed the
IFC by a 12-6 vote, but the pro-

‘THIS YEAR ONLY" BASIS FA V'ORED

 

posal from the Social iii
when voted on, failed to pass by..
7-9 vote.

The original proposal from the
Social Committee, which was re-
jected, stated that “there shall be
no fraternity sponsored combos in
conflict with University dances on
Friday nights of dance sets.”

The aah if mene would
have only affected two dance sets

Discussion in the IFC meeting
showed that certain members of
the Council felt that to adopt such
a proposal would be to limit what
power the IFC had, and that such
a move would cause the IFC to

 

Debaters Face Carolina On TV

Over United

Washington and Lee’s champion- ,

ship debate team will take on the
University of North Carolina in a
debate March 12 before the cameras
of a North Carolina television sta-
tion.

The debaters will appear on “De-

educational station operated by the
University of North Carolina. The
teams will discuss the topic “Re-

become “a rubber stamp for the
Administration.”

Galef Appears

Dance Board President Steve
Galef attended the meeting and
explained that he felt the pro-
posal was necessary since attend-
ance at the dances had been off
near the close of the dances.

Galef reported that the Social
Functions Committee of the facul-
ty had previously given up five
University sponsored dances (this
does not mean concerts or dance
sets in the past four years.)

To say that the Social Functions
Committe, Galef explained, is not
honestly making an effort to co-
operate with the fraternities would
be a mistake.

Issue Goes to Houses

It was decided that the question
would be returned to the houses
and that it would be aired again
at next week’s IFC meeting.

In other business, the IFC voted
18-0 in favor of allowing members
of the Australian Lacrosse Team to
eat in the houses when the team
visits here.

Trophy To Be Awarded

It was announced that the IFC
Help Week trophy would be
awarded at next week’s meeting.

See editorial on page 2.

 

 

Those against were Galef, Rob-
erts, Page, Boiarsky, and Ogilvie.

The Committee voted through
an amendment that the minimum
of 50 signatures be raised to 150
in the petition for candidacy for a
major student body office.

The only two dissenting voters
were Ogilvie and Christian.

A further amendment, unanimous-
ly accepted, was that the 150 sig-
natures specifically be those of
Washington and Lee students.

An amendment was also unani-
mously passed that the petition
for candidacy be presented “the
second Monday after spring re-
cess,” rather than, as formerly
worded, “some suitable date in
in April.”

An added stipulation in the policy
of elections was inserted providing
that “if no simple majority of the
voters is obtained by a candidate
there shall be a run-off election
between the two candidates receiv-
ing the largest number of votes.”

Voted to be stricken from the
Constitution was the article “No
fraternity campus organization, or
individual with the backing of such
organizations, shall by threat or
coercion direct the vote of any in-
dividual or group of individuals”
ete.

The only dissenting voters were
Christian and Suttle.

Among the other actions of the
EC, a section added under “C” of
Article IV that “The member from
the Publications Board shall be
elected on the same day as the
General Student Body Election,”
was carried unanimously,

An amendment was proposed that
the member of the Publication Board
and the Secretary be omitted and
replaced by two representatives at
large, the Secretary to be chosen
by the incoming EC, but it was voted
down.

The proposal failed to carry by
a two-thirds majority, with a vote
of 7 for and 5 against.

Voting for the amendment were
Ireland, Paul, McThenia, Robrecht
Bishop, Christian, and Suttle.

In addition to its review of the
Constitution, the EC discussed the
Assimilation Committee and re-
solved that the best means of en-
forcing its rules is the “prompt

Fraternities Should Take More Interest In IFC’s Problems

Washington and Lee University’s In-
terfraternity Council, not unlike similar or-
ganizations found on other college cam-
puses, is generally recognized by both the
Administration and the Student Body as
being a relatively weak organization.

Recent events in the news have brought
the remote possibility of a sophomore rush
system to W&L, and these news items
clearly indicate that our IFC needs a change
in policy. This ‘‘do-nothing” organization,
to be something blunt, had better start do-
ing something or face the possibility of be-
coming a rubber stamp for the whims of
“The Hill.”

This year has seen the IFC take some
(but few) constructive steps, namely the
passing of a pledge training resolution in
December which forbids having fraternity
training sessions during the first semester
past 11 p.m. The passing of the watered-
down Help Week proposals, we are reluct-
ant to admit, could also be called a positive
move.

New and more important issues pres-
ently face the IFC. The sophomore rush
petition, which has been so much publi-
cized, stares in the face of the IFC, while
the possibility of further combo restrictions
seem to appear in the making more and
more every day.

Washington and Lee’s IFC, needless to
say, is far too weak an organization. Issues
are met by the fraternities with a basically
apathetic attitude, and this indifference is
thus reflected in a basically disinterested
IFC.

The Tuesday Edition would suggest, al-
though we fear that it may do little or no
good, that the IFC and especially each of
the 18 social fraternities examine closely the
events that surround any legislation propos-
ed or passed by the IFC.

In all the above named cases, where
IFC action did take place, whether reluct-

antly or not, the fact remains that under
no circumstances did any action take place
without prodding either from the Adminis-
tration or from the faculty. The IFC in no
cases took the initative, the group simply
sat back, did nothing, and was forced into
action for fear of intervention from the
University.

Is this attitude, we ask the fraternities
and the IFC, the correct one to hold in this

 

day of growing dislike for social fraternities?
No, we must answer, and our answer must
come in the form of a loud and ringing
negative voice.

WEL Loe At Communism

Sixth In A Series

This is the sixth in a series of nine

Perhaps the major problem surround-
ing the IFC lies in the tradition of carrying
issues back to the houses for vote before
any steps can be taken by the fraternity
group. (The IFC Constitution, we add,
does not require that the above be done, it
simply is a tradition.) Another problem fac-
ing the IFC is that its representatives are
often not the fraternity officers (much less
the presidents) but are usually inexpeti-

enced sophomores who have political de-
sires.

THE FUTURE: WHAT DOES IT HOLD?

In any evaluation of our IFC, we are

 

faced with the future. The rush petition
has brought this question to a head, for
our fraternity system, as we presently know
it, could hang in the balance if such a sys-
tem is adopted.

Our readers may ask what the areas for
reform actually are. One major area lies in
in the fact that fraternity averages are con-
stantly low. The list of fraternity standings
for the first semester, for instance, reveals
that only six of the 18 houses were above
the all-men’s average.

This past semester’s figure, we are un-
happy to report, is not the exception, but
rather the rule.

To illustrate what can happen as a re-
sult of IFC inaction, let us look at what re-
cently took place at the University of North
Carolina.

The administration of UNC requested
the IFC there to come up with a solution
to the fraternities’ constantly having bad
grades. The IFC, we have been led to be-
lieve, did nothing, and as a result the ad-
ministration passed a resolution denying
rush privileges for one year to fraternities,
if 80 per cent of their members failed to
have ‘‘C” averages. This example painfully
indicates what can, and will, happen where
inaction is the dominant characteristic of
the IFC.

We would suggest, in view of the many
problems which currently face our IFC, that
the Council take the initiative in instituting
reforms where reform is in order.

The IFC should act on its own, not due
to the prodding from the University, re-
gardless of the area where change is being
considered.

The IFC should work closely with other
groups, namely the EC and the Dance
Board, in an effort to determine where
problems lie and where reforms are needed.

Dr. Louis H. Hodges’ article, The

Dr. Hodges points out that with

By DR. LOUIS H. HODGES
Associate Professor of Religion

The Church in Russia has en-
tered what may meaningfully be
called the “post-Constantinian
era.” Historically in the West since
Constatine heads of church and
state have ordinarily held in com-
mon on a theistic world-view. It
was within this context of unity
that struggles for power were
fixed. With the triumph of Marx-

ist philosophy and the Communist
Party in the Soviet state there has
come the destruction of that basic
unity. A new dimension has thus
been added to the traditional con-
flict between crown and church:
church and state are based upon
incompatible world-views.

The Bolshiviks very early
sought to destroy the churches by
heavy-handed techniques such as
locking church doors, confiscating

Track-O-Gram Ends With
Or In Standard English-- ‘Hi! Lemons Get Stronger’

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

As you all know the people in the gym and
I have a loving and lasting relationship which
has most recently culminated
in my being placed on their
mailing list.

If you are like me, you
probably didn’t know they
even had one—but you
=. should. And I highly recom-
mend your trying for a po-
sition on this highly regard-
ed roll, for I predict it will
become a status symbol of
the first order.

Now the literature which
they are sending out is not
conventional, and it even has a special desig-
nation—the TRACK-O-GRAM. This, I have
found out, means that the letter is somewhere
between dirty post cards and singing tele-
grams. And they’re much more fun than either,
providing you’re reading someone else’s, and
not getting your own.

The TRACK-O-GRAM is too priceless to
just describe, so I'll give you some particularly
juicy extractions, and then give you a few
thoughts I’ve had. Please remember that I’m
not making any of this up, that they’re for real,
and that obscene literature should be reported
to your postmaster.

TRACK-O-GRAM No. 1 starts out like this:

“This is number one of a series of ‘poop sheets’
to keep the W&L track team informed. Please

 

Craven

keep them in a handy file so that you can refer
to them. Important dates, times, places, and
people will be discussed.

“Good, thought I, somebody is initiating a
let’s bring jocks up-to-date on what’s hap-
pening in the world program.” (A sort of In-
siders Newsletter for straps.) But no, on this
same page was the plea: “Bodies especially
needed for the hurdles, etc.” (“Forget the poli-
tics, Craven,” I said, “this is serious, someone
has decided that bodies are needed.” This leads
me to wonder how the events have been per-
formed in the past. A bodiless track team
sounds sort of silly.’)

But I let that pass for we all know that some
pretty silly things have been done in the past.
Then I read in great big letters: “Bring some
extra bodies with you!!!” (Now this is serious,
because it involves me, and I’m damned if I
want anybody bringing my body with him to
some crazy meeting.)

TRACK-0-GRAM No. 2 is a little more
newsy, but there isn’t much discussion of im-
portant places or people, at least not unless
you think Wilson Field is an important place.
But, let’s on to the particulars. Under “C” of
item one the letter says: “Come dressed ‘a la
jock strap.” Now who who ever thought jock
strap was French? And even if you did, did
you ever put one a “a la?” And who wants
to go to a meeting dressed like that anyway?
Especially with the weather what it is. Again in
item one there was a plea for bodies.

Item No. 2 is classic: “Excluding Sundays
and Meetdays (Which day is that? I thought

‘Citrus, Altius, Fortius,’

that there were only seven.) we want your
body (Well, you can’t have it) for only one
hour (Not even for that long.) For every min-
ute on the field beyond one hour, we will
charge you a loafing time—25 cents.” (Good
luck, I’ll stay on the field as long as I want. It’s
my field just as much as it is yours.)

Here are the advantages of all this; “we
will... (1) make you stronger and faster (HA),
(2) make you feel better (sleep better and a
higher EUPHORIA INDEX) (Good luck on
that, and besides my euphoria index is fine,
thank you, and I already sleep pretty good,
just ask my professors.) (3) Makes you look
better.” (Don’t bite off more than you can
chew is all I can say to that).

Item No. 3 is “The Plan” which reads like
directions to a new board game like Monopoly.
(Sample: “Fill 49 spaces on the...”)

I’m trying not to belabor this thing any
more than it’s worth, so I'll move on to the
ending of TRACK-O-GRAM No. 2. It says: “If
you can’t cut the mustard, turn in your gear.”
(This was the first time I realized there would
be food, and hell, anybody can cut mustard,
even without a knife.)

But the living end is the last three words,
and you won't believe it. It’s Latin! Unfortun-
ately, it’s written in longhand, so I can only
guess at the words, I think it says, “CITRUS,
ALTIUS, FORTIUS” which means “Hi! Lem-
ons, get stronger!” It could also mean “strong
lemons get high.”

Figure it out.

ecclesiastical wealth, and disfran-
chising clergy. Hitler demonstrat-
ed in 1943—by reopening many of
the churches—that the support of
the churches was both valuable
and available. Stalin, catching on,
made concessions to the churches
in a bid for their support in the
war effort. As a consequence,
many of the establishments re-
vived by Hitler remain active to-
day.
Present Soviet Policy

Being fully aware of the fun-
damental incompatibility between
Communist philosophy and Chris-
tian theology, the present Soviet
government is fighting Christianity
in several ways.

The first line of attack is the
positive one of instruction of the
young in Marxist philosophy and
method. Soviet “evangelism” for
Marxism has certainly equalled in
fevor that of historic Christianity.
Indeed, the Communists have
learned much from church his-
tory—cathechetical instruction, the
Inquisition, and perhaps the
“witch-hunts” of New England.

A second tactic, in fact the re-
verse side of the first, is an at-
tack upon Christian faith as “su-
perstition.” A reintensification of
anti-religious efforts is evident,
for example, in the establishment
in 1960 of a new Soviet monthly,
Science and Religion. This publi-
cation seeks by both ridicule and
serious debate to unveil the “su-
perstition” of Christianity and to
demonstrate the deleterious ef-
fect of Christianity—particularly
Christ’s forgiveness—upon “good
Soviet morals.”

The third effort against religion
is to ignore the churches by es-
tablishing state institutions to ful-
fill the roles heretofore performed
by the churches—e.g., civil rituals
to supplant the traditional rites of
baptism and confirmation. This
policy betrays Soviet recognition
that harsh suppression of the in-
stitution often results in new vi-
tality for it underground.

Against, Not For Russian Church

Strength of Church

The total effect of Soviet pol-
icy on the Church is difficult to
assess. That the Church is still
quite alive is implicit in the very
existence of the state’s attack.

Even if reliable statistics were
available—as they are not—they
would mean very little for an es-
timate of the relative strength of
Christianity in Russia. We know
that approximately 50 million Rus-
sians, about one-fourth of the
population, are members of the
Russian Orthodox Church.

A number of protestant groups
have gained a foothold in Russia.
Among them are Baptist, Seventh
Day Adventist, Lutheran, and
Evangelical and Reform churches.
The size and strength of these is
not known, though one estimate of
Baptist membership is 520,000.

Strangely enough, Protestants
have enjoyed considerably more
freedom under the Communists
than under the Czars. Protestant
groups were placed at quite a dis-
advantage by the established state
church (Russian Orthodox) before
1917. Under the Communist state,
which is avowedly atheistic, Prot-
estants are at least on equal foot-
ing with other Christians.

There is evidence of continued
theological sophistication behind
the iron curtain. Some examples:
Russian theologians contribute
learned papers to the quarterly
Communio Viatorum published in
satellite Czechoslovakia; Orthodox
representatives entered knowingly
into debates of the recent assembly
of the World Council of Churches
in New Delhi; observers report
that local clerics effectively preach
traditional Christian faith inside
Russia.

A final gauge of the relative
strength of the Church is the fact
that increasingly the younger gen-
erations participate actively in
church affairs, though no one un-
der 18 can become a member.

Spring Teams Set For Opening Games

Mitchell, Wheeler To Lead fm

General Lacrosse Team
A gainst Australians

By BOB HANKEY

Looking toward the approaching lacrosse season, Coach
Bob McHenry stated that a real challenge lies ahead for the

squad of twenty-five stickmen.

He went on to say that the Generals lack depth and ex-
perience and emphasized the need for conditioning and hussle

to overcome this.

Netmen Prepare
For Dartmouth

By DICK KREITLER

The Washington and Lee tennis
team began formal workouts on the
all-weather courts March 2.
Dartmouth

The team is preparing for the in-
itial match against Dartmouth on
March 24. Over 30 candidates re-
ported for the 12 man squad and
when the snows reside challenge
matches will determine the lineup.

The team boasts only two re-
turning lettermen, newly-elected
captain John Baker and Jim Mell.
Coach Washburn has several fine

freshmen to work with, Jim De
Young and Randy Jones being top
prospects.

Bud Hollman, sophomore rack-
etman, earned his numerals last
spring and will return te try for
one of the top six positions.

 

* With only thirteen returning from

last year’s team McHenry is count-
ing heavily on a good crop of prom-
ising freshmen to round out the
squad. He expects to build around
Co-Captains Mitchell and_ Bill
Wheeler, Danny Reed, Charlie
Gummey, Johnny McDaniel, Randy
Wooten, Ray Miller and Pete Noo-
nan.

Coach McHenry is_ especially
impressed with freshmen Carol
Klingelhofer, Pete Preston, Bruce

Jackson, and Bob Hankey, and ,
looks forward to them helping the

nine returning lettermen.

W&L still has one of the toughest
schedules in the country facing three
of the nations top teams—Johns
Hopkins, Baltimore University and
the University of Virginia. The Gen-
erals take on Penn State, Duke,
UNC, Brown, and the University of
Massachusetts along with other
highly rated lacrosse schools.

In addition to the regular col-
legiate slate Washington and Lee
opens the season against an all-star
Australian team March 21 at 4 p.m.
Tickets for this game are selling for
$1.00 and are available at the of-
fice of the Director of Intercollegiate
Athletics in Doremus Gym.

 

Bip Fauber Basketball Captain;
Led W&L Generals In Rebounds

The 1961-62 edition of Washington
and Lee basketball came to a close
last week when the Generals bowed
to Norfolk William and Mary by a
score of 75-79.

6-11 Record

W&L closed out the court season
with a six-eleven slate with all six
victories coming at the Doremus
Gym court.

Fauber Again
Roger “Bip” Fauber, the 6’ 2”
General forward from Lynchburg,
was elected captain for next sea-
son at a meeting of the team late
last week.

Top Rebounder
Fauber again this year led the
team in rebounds with an 18.1 aver-
age per game. Sophomore guard
Tom Supak was the top scorer for
the Generals with a 15.1 average.

Fauber was second on the squad
tossing 14.6 points on the average
and Louis Paterno ended up third
with a 116 average.

Percentages

Captain Fauber was the top Gen-
eral in the percentage department
also. He had a 46 per cent seasonal
average in field goals and was 79
per cent from the foul line.

Eighth in Nation

Currently Fauber ranks eighth in
the nation’s smaller college players
in rebounds, but is liable to drop
a couple of notches when total sea-
son records have been compiled.

Weather Bad, Prospects Bright
For Veteran W&L Baseballers

It’s baseball season once again
at Washington and Lee. If you don’t
believe it, just ask the weatherman.

This is the third year in a row that
the Generals have had their spring
practice hampered by bad weather.
The snow is expected to curtail their
outdoor activity for some time, be-
cause even after it melts, time must
be allowed for the field to dry out, to
avoid its being torn up by the play-
ers’ spikes.

This year’s team will be out to
better last year’s 8-4 record, the
first winning season the team had
in some time. To pull this trick
coach Joe Lyles has 12 lettermen,
several unlettered veterans, and a
crop of freshmen who, according
to him, “look pretty good.”

Lyles can put a letterman at
every one of the eight regular spots
on the diamond. Behind the plate
he’s got senior Jim Russ. In fact, he
has seniors to fill all of the vital
area “up the middle,” with Park
Gilmore to play second base, team
captain Ned Hobbs at shortstop, and
Robin Wood in center field.

last year’s second leading hitter, to
play third base, and either sopho-
more Howard Martin or senior Mike
Monier to play first. Monier won his
letter in his sophomore year, but
was forced to sit last year out, and
Martin took over the position.

To go with Wood in the outfield,
there are senior Bobby Williams,
last year’s leading hitter, in left,
and junior Buck Rose, who closed
out last season with a spectacular
diving catch, in right.

The pitching staff is the question
mark this year. Last year’s eight
wins were accounted for in large
part by the graduated Roy Car-
penter, who won five. The other
three wins went to righthanders
Phil Sharp and Penn Way, and

lefthanded Brice Gamber.

sophomores. All three are letter-

Behind the lettermen, Lyles has
Sandy Smith, a junior outfielder
with two years’ experience on the
bench; Jack Cover, junior outfielder-
first baseman who’s back after a
year’s layoff; and senior Jim Gwinn,
a pitcher, back after two years of
inactivity.

From the freshman class, Lyles
must find another catcher, a left-
handed pitcher, and some reserve
infielders.

He may have the southpaw he
needs in Chris Wigert, like soph-
omore Way a native of New Jersey.

Skip Essex and Fox Urquhart are

Sophomore Henry Sackett and Cap-

Paul Ajermark and Jeff Conrad in
the pole vault as promising fresh-
men.

Chris Kell and Bill Jamison are
trying out for the sprints. Dave
Killebrew is running the 440 and
Ken Boiarsky will compete in the

The team should be strong in
the sprints, high jump, broad

will lack some in depthe.

About 50 men came out for the
first practice, but Coach Lord would
like to see that number doubled be-
fore the start of the season, espec-
ially more men in the field events.

With a sincere effort, the IFC can gain
the status of being a powerful and worth-

If inaction continues to be the rule,
however, we can only predict disaster for

the IFC, and in the long run, for each of

the social fraternities.

 

Russians See Value Of Church

(Continued from page 2)

Despite outward signs, however,
the Church wields little power in
Soviet society since no member of
the Party can be a member of the
Church. The Church is not in a
position to influence public policy,
this making Christian action very
difficult.

After about 45 years of Soviet
efforts to remove Christianity from
the Russian scene the Church re-
mains alive. The problems asso-
ciated with eradicating approxi-
mately a thousand years of Chris-
tian influence in Russia are be-
coming increasingly apparent.

Where the state will turn in
the future no one can predict with
accuracy. Some think that the
present policy may be abandoned
or perhaps pursued simultaneously
with attempts to use the Church
as the Czars did so effectively. The
radical philosophical difference be-
tween the Party and the Czars,
however, is likely to prevent a
return to the former close alliance
of Church and State.

Another possibility is all-out
persecution of the Church. In past
centuries Christianity has most of-
ten gained strength (but lost mem-
bers) when under persecution.
This means that the Soviets must
devise a workable method of per-
secution if they follow this line
of attack. Whether they can re-
mains to be seen.

A more likely path, in my
opinion, is a continuation of pol-
icy in effect since the Revolution,
ie., intermittent attack within a

Also discussed was the question
of whether the EC would conduct

movements on campus. Meade
Christian and Ray Robrecht were

on the poll before the EC would
take action on the matter.

general policy of trying to by-pass
the Church through state func-
tions—all this in hopes that the
church will wither away. This has
at least the prestige of Lenin be-
hind it.

Whatever state policy may be,
the future can present only more,
not fewer, problems. As the in-
dustrial revolution bears more and
and more fruit in Russia, the
Christians of Russia face the task
of relating Christianity meaning-
fully to human life under complex,
urban-industrial conditions. The
Church will stand or fall on the
basis of the creativity it can mus-
ter in dealing with that new world.

Lenin’s word was that the state
should not bother itself with
Christianity since it “will be
thrown on the rubbish heap by
the mere force of economic de-
velopment.” The unanswerable
question of the future of chris-
tianity in Russia, therefore, is
whether a church not allowed to
speak directly on public issues can
avoid this end.

catcher Ashley Allen.

Righthanders dominate the veter-

is centerfielder Wood, and there are
two southpaw pitchers.

But Lyles expects the veterans to
run better and make fewer mental

SHAKESPEARE DOESN’T LIVE HERE
ANY MORE
A recent and most heartening development in American college
life has been the emergence of the artist-in-residence. In fact,
the artist-in-residence has become as familiar a sight on campus
as Latin ponies, leather elbow patches, Rorschach tests, hula
hoops, and Marlboro cigarettes.

And we all know how familiar that is—I mean Marlboro ciga-
rettes. And why should it not be familiar? Why, where learning
is king, where taste is sovereign, where brain power rules
supreme, should not Marlboro be everyone’s favorite? The same
good sense that gets you through an exam in Restoration Poetry
or solid-state physics certainly does not desert you when you
come to pick a cigarette. You look for a flavor that is flavorful,
a filter pure and white, a choice of pack or box, a lot to like. You
look, in short, for Marlboro—and happily you don’t have to look
far. Marlboro is available at your friendly tobacconist’s or vend-
ing machine, wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty states and
Las Vegas.

But I digress. We were speaking of the new campus phenome-
non—the artist-in-residence—a man or woman who writes,
paints, or composes right on your very own campus and who is
also available for occasional consultations with superior students.

Take, for example, William Cullen Sigafoos, artist-in-residence
at the Toledo College of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identifi-
cation.

As we all know, Mr. Sigafoos has been working for many years
on an epic poem in rhymed couplets about the opening of the
Youngstown-Akron highway. Until, however, he went into
residence at the Toledo College of Belles Lettres and Finger-
print Identification, his progress was not what you would call
rapid. He started well enough with the immortal couplet we all
know: They speed along on wheels of rubber, rushing home in
time for subber .

Then Mr. Sigafoos got stuck. It is not that his muse deserted
him; it is that he became involved in a series of time-consuming
episodes—a prefrontal lobotomy for Irwin, his faithful sled
dog; fourteen consecutive months of jury duty on a very com-
plicated case of overtime parking; getting his coattail caught in
the door of a jet bound for Brisbane, Australia; stuff like that.

He was engaged in a very arduous job in Sandusky — posing
for a sculptor of hydrants—when an offer came from the Toledo
College of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identification to take
up residence there, finish his magnum opus and, from time to
time, see a few gifted students.

Mr. Sigafoos accepted with pleasure and in three short years
completed the second couplet of his Youngstown-Akron Turnpike
epic: The highway is made of solid concrete and at the toll station you
get a receipt. y3

Vas
rae". aah)

"Wat 6 trath Pr’ <ztd ne

Then a few gifted students came to visit him.

They were a
prepossessing lot—the boys with corduroy jackets and long,
shaggy beards; the girls also with corduroy jackets but with
beards neatly braided.

“What is truth?” said one. “What is beauty?” said another,

“Should a writer live first and write later or should he write
and do a little living in his spare time?” said another.

“How do you find happiness—and having found it, how do
you get rid of it?” said another.

“Whither are we drifting?” said another.

I don’t know whither you are drifting,” said Mr, Sigafoos,
‘but as for me, I am drifting back to Sandusky to pose for the
hydrant sculptor.”

And back he went, alas, leaving only a fragment of his Youngs-
town-Akron Turnpike epic to rank with other such uncom-
pleted masterpieces as Schubert’ s Unfinished Symphony, the
Venus de Milo, and Singer’s Midgets.

& + x
Take cheer, good friends, from one masterpiece that is com-
plete. We, refer, of course, to Marlboro cigarettes. Filter
end and tobacco end are both as good as tobacco artistry
and science can make them.

IFC President Says Fraternities
Only Get What They Ask For

To the Editor:

Last year, the LF.C. was called
the “Inert Fraternity Council” and
this week it was called a “do-noth-
ing” organization. I, for one, would
not say that these accusations are
unfounded but I certainly would say
they are unfair and illusionary. They
have turned the ILF.C. into a scape-
goat as an organization that is weak,
inert, and fumbling in the eyes of
many students, faculty, and the ad-
ministration. This is far from the
true picture of the Council.

I look at the IFC as an organiza-
tion created to function as a repre-
sentative body of the fraternity men
on our campus. In this capacity, the
IFC discusses topics which it and
its officers deem important, and con-
sequently establish and maintain
a set of policies related to these top-
ics. All policies adopted by the IFC

Fischer To Give
Geology Lecture

A member of the geology depart-
ment of Princeton Univ. will discuss
“Andean Landscapes and Geology”
in a public lecture tonight at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Dr. Alfred Fischer will give his
illustrated talk at 8 p.m. in duPont
Auditorium. His appearance is und-
er the sponsorship of W&L’s depart-
ment of geology and the American
Geological Institute.

He was also guest lecturer for
two geology classes this morning.

A native of Rothenburg, Germany,
Dr. Fischer was educated in the
United States. He received his bach-
elor of science degree from the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin and his Ph.D.
from Columbia University.

He has taught at Virginia Poly-
technic Institute, the University of
Rochester and the University of
Kansas. He also has worked for the
Stanolind Oil Company in Kansas
and the International Petroleum
Company of Peru.

Dr. Fischer’s primary fields of
study are historical geology and in-
vertebrate paleontology. He is the
co-author of a textbook on paleon-
tology.

represent the majority of our fra-
ternities. The IFC was created
neither to pass down the opinions
of the administration nor to pass
mandate and shove them down the
throats of the fraternities. The
strength of the IFC stems from the
fact that its policies are the poli-
cies of the fraternities and as such
must receive fraternity support.

The faculty and the university
administration are above the IFC,
needless to say in absolute power,
and it is the IFC officers which real-
ize this more than anyone else.

However, in no case this year or
in past years has there been a pro-
posal made from the IFC adminis-~-
tration or from a particular IFC
committee in which the IFC’s of-
ficers did not feel the proposals to
be anything short of the best and
most constructive policy for the
Council, and consequently all 18
fraternities. The IFC is not an oli-
garchy as some things on this cam-
pus, rather, it is a democratic or-
ganization slow and easy to criticize.
Above all, it is not and will not be a
rubber stamp for the whims of “the
Hill.” The fact that “the Hill” ex-
presses their opinion on some mat-
ters and requests IFC action does not
mean the Council is weak and utter-
ly subservient. It is the IFC’s duty
to study and consider the faculty’s
requests, just as anything proposed
from within the IFC, is studied and
considered. Furthermore, in doing
this, “the Hill” is recognizing the
IFC’s power and sovereignty to take
action over fraternity matters.

The charge I never can under-
stand is that the IFC is weak. This
is because there is no defined limit
on the powers of the IFC over fra-
ternities. Also, by looking at the IFC
constitution and by-laws, we can see
some of the chief areas long given to
the IFC’s administration: rush week,
pledging, disputes among fraterni-
ties, scheduling and limiting of fra-
ternity social functions, and others.
The IFC’s Judicial Committee can
and would take away these privi-
leges from any fraternity when
deemed necessary—certainly, this is
no weak base.

From this base, though, the IFC
has taken actions which have been
weak. This is partly true, but let’s
look just at this year, and we can
see a changing attitude within the
IFC, and much of this change was
not due to faculty pressure at all.
Certainly, there was no faculty

 

pressure to have Dick Fletcher
speak to the compulsory IFC pledge
assembly. Also, the “watered-down”
Help Week proposals and the Help
Week Committee were of the IFC’s
own initiative and fortunately, the
proposals were watered down
enough to cause three houses to
abandon “Hell Week” altogether at
the time and several others to do the
same since then. No “Help Week”
was ever so mild or so constructive.
The IFC also passed legislation over
the pledge-training period, which
was an area never before covered
by the IFC. I fail to see with such
results as these that the IFC is al-
together weak in its action.

On the other hand, I will agree
with the Tuesday Edition that fra-
ternities should take more interest
in the IFC’s problems. The IFC is
hampered by apathetic and indif-
ferent members. I think a prime
example of this can be taken from
this past meeting where certain
members felt that to adopt the IFC
Social Committee’s proposal (work-
ed out in conjunction with the
Dance Board) would have limit-
ed what power the IFC had and
cause the IFC to become a rubber
stamp of the administration. In the
first place, the adoption of the pro-
posals would have greatly strength-
ened the IFC, and secondly, the pro-
posal was not from the administra-
tion or faculty (they had neither
seen it nor heard of it), but from
IFC members, officers, and the head
and co-head of the Dance Board
(both of whom are students and fra-
ternity men).

Attitudes of this type do greatly
hamper the I.F.C.—they are uncon-
structive and detrimental. What the
fraternity man must realize is that
the ILF.C. can do nothing without
support, which it has every right
to expect, despite failures. If fra-
ternities can continue in the con-
structive vein they are showing now,
the IFC will regain much lost pow-
er and find much new power. Espec-
ially important this Spring will be
the reconsideration of the combo
situation, and the all-important
Rush Week study. The LF.C. will
be able to attain constructive chang-
es or maintain a constructive sta-
tus quo, only if fraternity men are
willing to make the changes which
are in keeping with the general tem-

po of events on our campus inside, |

among, and outside of the fraterni-
ties.

Scheduled For Concert

 

Othello To Play
Wednesday Nite
Thru Saturday

Four performances of William
Shakespeare’s “Othello” will be
staged next week by members of the
Troubadour Theater.

The two and a half hour play will
run nightly Wednesday through Sat-
urday in the Troubadour Theater at
the edge of the campus. Curtain
time for each performance is 8:15
p.m.

A 25-member cast led by Lexing-
ton High School junior Lisa Tracy
as Desdemona and Washington and
Lee senior Robert Allen as Othello
will participate in the play under
the direction of Dr. Cecil D. Jones,
Jr., assistant professor of fine arts.
Both leading actors are Troubadour
Theater veterans.

Other principal actors include stu-
dents John Dunnell as Iago, Steve
Colvin as Cassio, Tim Morton as
Roderigo and Miss Josephine Un-
ger, a member of the faculty of
neighboring Southern Seminary, as
Emilia.

The principal actors for the trag-
edy have been preparing for over
two months, according to Dr. Jones.
Nightly rehearsals with the full cast
have been underway for five weeks.

A six-foot extension has been
built on the front of the regular
Troudabour Theater stage for act-
ors’ use during soliloquies and two-
character scenes. Stage coloring has
been kept neutral to enhance the 32
Italian Renaissance costumes on or-
der from a New York costume
house. Part of the “Othello” cos-
tumes are designed from sketches
by Robert Edmond Jones, a leading
theatrical designer.

“One of the most difficult prob-
lems in producing a Shakespearean
tragedy is that of speaking verse
and recreating of strong and pas-
sionate human emotions so that they
are believable for the audience,” Dr.
Jones said.

“Beyond our work with the prin-
cipal actors, we encounter the prob-
lem of integrating the work of a
cast of 25 so that they all are striv-
ing for a common goal throughout
the play,” the director said.

Reservations for performances of
“Othello” may be made by calling
HO 3-2181, etx. 273, between 2-5
p.m. or 6-8 p.m. any day starting
tonight.

Troup publicity director Andy
Leonard says that any freshman or
sophomores interested in working on
the Theatre business staff should re-
port to the Theatre tonight at 7:30
p.m.

 

Report Says Zimmerman
Died of Natural Causes;
Funeral Is Tomorrow

Medical officials said today that
Washington and Lee University
senior John Louis Zimmerman, who
was found dead in his dormitory
room Wednesday, died of natural
causes.

The natural causes opinion was is-
sued by Dr. Frederick A. Fedde-
man, Lexington medical examiner.

Zimmerman, who lived in Glen-
dale, Ohio, was found dead Wed-
nesday evening in his room in Bak-
er Dormitory by two of his fratern-
ity brothers after he was missed at
the regular evening meal at the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity house.

A funeral service will be held Sat-
urday at 10 a.m. from the First Pres-
byterian Church in Glendale. Burial
will follow in Glendale’s Oak Hill
Cemetery. Dean of Students Edward
C. Atwood, Jr., will represent Wash-
ington and Lee at the funeral.

Zimmerman is survived by his
parents, Mr. and Mrs. John Wil-
liam Zimmerman, and a sister, all
of Glendale.

By STEVE SMITH

Dave Guard’s Whiskeyhill Singers will be featured at the
Saturday night concert of Springs weekend, Dance Set Presi-

dent Steve Galef said today.

 

The new quartet was formed by*
Guard a few months after his split
with the Kingston Trio of which
he was leader. The Whiskeyhill
Singers have been touring north-
eastern schools for the last few
months, and, according to Galef,
have been met with sellout audi-
ences.

The singing of Guard, who is a
leading exponent of genuine folk
music, is in line with the Dance
Board’s experiment in bringing folk
music to W&L, said Galef.

If the Springs folk music week-
end goes over, a Folk Music Festi-
val may be held here next October.

Talented Group

Guard picked the other members
of the quartet with the object of
forming a group which shared his
own ideas about folk music. The
first to join him was twenty-five
year-old Cyrus Faryar, singer-gui-
tarist-banjoist.

Faryar was a schoolmate of Guard
in Honolulu, although he was born
in Teheran, Iran, of Persian-English
parents. Guard tracked him to a
Phoenix coffee house to recruit him.

Next, Guard signed Victor Baciga-
lupi, 37 years of age. Bacigalupi is
a Stanford graduate who studied
music on a Ford Fellowship Foun-
dation scholarship at San Francis-
co State. He is a bassist, but is also
proficient on the guitar and gitarron
(Mexican bass). Guard hooked him
with the promise of making him
singer in the new group.

 

Judy Henske was recruited from
an Oklahoma City coffee house;
she had just begun to make a name
in folk singing and was at first re-
luctant to join the group. She per-
forms with the six string guitar,
banjo, tambourine, and autoharp in
addition to singing. She is a 23 year-
old brunette.

Debut on Feb. 1

The Whiskeyhill Singers made
their debut on Feb. 1 of this year.
They plan to publish their first al-
bum in about a month. The quartet
spent a great deal of time working
together before they stepped onto
the stage.

Commenting on his group, Guard
said, “Our music is designed for no
particular age group or segment
of the population. We hope every-
one likes it, but we’re not going to
adapt it to usit any fad or aim for
any ‘market’ in particular.

The leader stresses the point of
good music, for it his belief that a
performer can neither underesti-
mate the American public, nor lec-
ture to it, and that the public, in
the long run, will never fully accept
so-called “commercial music” from
top artists.

He also called his singers “a new
and different sound,” and “exciting.”
The quartet will perform from

8 to 10 o’clock on Saturday night
of Springs, April 14.

 

ROTC Seniors Learn Branches;
Thirty-One Seeking Deferments

Washington and Lee’s 55 seniors in Army ROTC have received their
branch assignments for their tour of active duty. All will serve two years.
Of the seniors, 31 have asked for deferment of their active duty in
order to go on to graduate study. According to Major A. J. Moller of the
ROTC department, it is likely that only those seniors going on to study
medicine, law, or psychology will get their deferments.
Below is a list of the seniors and their branch assignments. Active duty

begins on the date listed. The rest of

the seniors who have not asked for

deferments should get their orders for active duty within the month.

Constitutional Changes

The Executive Committee, to nobody’s disappointment,
has voted to ask the student body to approve a constitutional
amendment doing away with the nominating convention for
student body officers. According to the new amendment can-
didates will have to present a petition signed by 150 of their
fellow students in order to get their name on the ballot.

The 150-signature requirement is good in that it assures
that a man has substantial support for an office and still makes
it possible for third or even fourth candidates, to run for office.
The EC will schedule a voluntary assembly every spring for
candidates to present their views and such platforms as they

have.

We are pleased that the movement to remove the Publi-
cations Board representative from the EC has so far failed
The close vote (supporters of the amendment failed to get
their two-thirds majority by one vote) is hardly a vote of con-
fidence in the Publications Board. But we know of no better
way to assure a strong and experienced EC than the present
method. We are not surprised that the EC has been unable to
find a substitute satisfactory to two-thirds of the Committee.

Other changes are very useful simplifications of the consti-
tution which bring it more in line with actual student govern-
ment practice. We'll discuss them when the EC releases their
final draft of their proposed changes. Then it will be up to the
student body to pass the new constitution by a simple majority.

Facing A Complex Problem

It has been said many times before, but we will say it again:
the threat of atomic war hovers over our civilization like an
impersonal god, threatening wanton, amoral destruction, and
pervading our society with a sense of hopelessness and indiffer-
ence. The tremendous moral questions posed by the advent of
nuclear weapons are the great problems of our generation, and
they will continue to be for a long time.

Bill Lowry is attempting to cope with this subject in the cur-
rent issues of Protest, and two columns on the ramifications
of nuclear disarmament appear in today’s Ring-tum Phi. We
urge that our readers study these opinions. We owe it to our-
selves to give them our attention.

 

Fraternity Responsibility

The Tuesday Edition’s attack on the IFC was justified
to some extent, but the blame for that group’s relative inaction
must be thrown back on the University’s fraternity men. For
the IFC has been accurate in their representation of the fra-
ternities’ viewpoint. They have done nothing except when
forced to. This is certainly not the fault of the IFC itself, nor
of the IFC officers, who have been trying for the past several
years to initiate some useful changes. They have gotten no
support whatsoever from the fraternity rank-and-file.

What the fraternity men at W&L must realize is that they
have a personal responsibility for the entire fraternity system
here. If they are too lazy to make some well-considered changes
they deserve to be regulated more closely from the Hill. We
have always championed the right of the students to live their
own lives with a minimum of regulation. But this right implies
a responsibility to respect the viewpoint of the faculty and

administration.

We believe in a strong fraternity system. But the power of
the fraternities will have to be limited if they insist on working,
consciously or not, against the larger goals of the University.
We think this is now the case in some houses, with respect to
their members’ studies and their finances.

IT'WO OPINIONS ON NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT

 

Harrington: Use Common Sense

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Colleges and crusades just seem to
naturally go together—and Wash-
ington and Lee is no exception. The
latest and loudest campus cam-
paign concerns neither student gov-
ernment nor social fraternities—it’s
a ban-the-bomb movement.

Chief promoter of peace and pro-
mulgator of nuclear horror is Protest
editor Bill Lowry. Lowry, who says
he has hardly gotten the program
started, already has a_ substantial
following. In several articles and
posters he has said, basically, what
most people already know: that a
nuclear war would be devastating to
the human race. He paints vivid pic-
tures of nuclear war, and succeeds
in convincing his readers that uni-
lateral disarmament would be great.

Admittedly, Lowry doesn’t know
exactly how to go about it. “But
something has to be done, and our
job now is to find out what’s going
on.” Agreed. But how can we be

Behind The News

There is a movement afoot in the
EC to make the office of president
of the IFC a position elected by the
entire student body.

There are also members who
would like to see the offices of
Dance Set President abolished. They
propose that the presidents of the
four undergraduate classes serve as
chairmen of the four weekends, ar-
guing that the present system is in-
efficient, and merely a political con-
venience.

sure or even suppose that nuclear
disarmament is a feasible solution?

Russian Score: 33 for 33

Lowry seems to think our atti-
tude towards the Russians is too
hostile. He suggests that perhaps
they aren’t really out for world
domination, but just for technologi-
cal or ideological domination. I sug-
gest that this is as bad—if not worse
—than military domination. He sug-
gests, further, that we have to trust
the Russians more. I suggest, furth-
er, that the Russians, in the realm of
political conflicts, have given us
every reason not to trust them. (Ac-
cording to one source, the Russians

have made 33 treaties since World
War I and have broken 33 treaties
since World War I.)

Several points seem to have been
omitted in Lowry’s arguments. What
guarantee do we have that, should
we disarm, Russia would follow
suit? Mutual inspection arrange-
ments would help, but what about
all those nasty little bombs that
are already made and stacked neatly
away in a Siberian warehouse some-
where? It seems a bit naive to sup-
pose that Russia—or the United
States either, for that matter—would
refrain from using nuclear weap-
ons should they be on the losing side
in the crucial days of a hot war.
Lowry has flagrantly dismissed
such concepts as limited warfare, the
so-called “balance of terror,” and
massive retaliation. As far as limit-
ed warfare is concerned, he said he
doesn’t believe the human race in-
telligent enough to refrain from us-
ing weapons if they have them—

 

even if the authorities concerned
realize the destructive powers of
such weapons. I wonder, then, why
he assumes they have the intelli-
gence to arrive at satisfactory dis-
armament agreements?

“Something Has To Be Done”

The most significant comment
Lowry has made so far is that
“something has to be done.” Of
course, he doesn’t know what has
to be done. No one else does, eith-
er. The truth of the matter seems to
be that humanity has overstepped
itself. Surely, the prospect of war
with today’s weapons is horrible. I
share with Lowry the aversion for
two-headed grandchildren. War, es-
pecially modern nuclear war, is a
frightening prospect. Lowry has
achieved one rather dubius thing—
he has called to our attention just
how pleasant a future we have to
look forward to. Unfortunately, dis-
armament is extremely unlikely to
rise as the answer to nuclear war.
In my opinion, the only way man
will ever be made to do away with
nuclear war is to have one; and, if
he manages to avoid rotting to death
from radiation, is able to scrounge
enough uncontaminated food out of
garbage cans, he can try to salvage
the few worthwhile aspects of “civi-
lization” and think twice before he
splits any more atoms.

Until that time, we can listen to
editor Lowry, hope that the impos-
sible will come true, and try to be-
lieve that Khrushchey, Kennedy,
and the rest of our destiny-shapers
have brains enough to keep their
fingers off the buttons.

Slater: It's Worth A Try

By HOWARD SLATER

To believe, as most of us do, that
man is “captain of his fate” is to
affirm an essential feature of West-
ern civilization. Western thought
has not been as naive as to deny
the significance of the environmental
influence upon man’s situation, but
there is an obvious distinction be-
tween determinism and _ fatalism;
and so it is asserted that men do
have control over their individual
destinies, however limited this con-
trol may be.

Why then is it true that men
choose to be like cattle, and reject
their right and their responsibility,
to exercise this control? (There is
a possible answer to this question
which may not be at all flattering
to some cows I know.) Has there
ever been a time when the majority
of men have taken it upon them-
selves to be the arbiters of their
own fate? These times must have
been few and far between.

Certainly, this is not one of them.
And how utterly horrible that
thought is! For now is the time
when the fates of all men are at

a more critical turning-point than
ever before. There can be no doubt
about that. We have the bombs and
missiles to prove it. How, then, are
we reacting to the problem in this
outpost of civilization? The answer
is fairly obvious, and bears a strong
relation to the major form of econ-
omic activity in this beef and dairy
district.
Who To Believe?

There is a certain amount of jus-
tification for this reaction. The ov-
erall problem, which includes the
questions of nuclear testing, the
arms race, disarmament, and fall-
out shelters, is riddled through and
through with seemingly insoluble
conflicts. For instance, it is impos-
sible to know who to believe, those
who say that there will be total
destruction of the human race as a
result of radiation, or those who say
that the results of radiation will be
practically nil.

But because a question or set of
questions is complex, does not mean
that we ought not to tackle them.
Besides, there is a rule of thumb

Alumnus Calls
Faculty Petition

Socialist Move

To the Editor:

This letter is to oppose delayed
rushing, which the faculty petition
claims will cure everything from
maladjusted freshmen to some of
the University’s complex problems.

W&L is, and has been, a very
strong fraternity college for over
100 years. Prospective students
know that pledging takes place the
first week of school and they are
affiliated with a fraternity, if they
want to join one, for the full four
years of college. I assume that if
some boys and their parents don’t
like our system, they would go else-
where.

Part of the faculty, 1962 model,
apparently thinks it detects reasons
for making a drastic change in our
fraternity operation. I suggest that
the faculty restrict its efforts to the
purpose for which it was hired—
teaching—and if it likes the system
better elsewhere, to kindly pack up
and leave.

The generalities advanced as rea-
sons for promoting this change are
misleading, irrelevant, and irrespon-
sible. In short, they are merely a
cover for what is really intended:
the elimination of fraternities.

For the vast majority of W&L stu-
dents, the fraternity is a good thing
and just as important a part of edu-
cation as books, classes, examina-
tions. The few students who don’t
make the grade due solely to the
fraternity to which they belong cer-
tainly are insufficient justification
to stifle or eliminate an institution
that provides such multiple advan-
tages to all the rest.

This is definitely a move to stifle
fraternities and if it is not defeated,
it can easily result in the complete
elimination of fraternities at W&L.
You may not know that there is a
strong socialistic sentiment running
in academic circles to eliminate fra-
ternities because (1) fraternities are
a bastion of conservative thinking
and influence, (2) fraternities with
their selective membership are in
opposition to the socialistic-minded
group who are ramming integration
down our throats, and (3) fraterni-
ties permit and encourage individ-
ualism which is in opposition to the
welfare state concept (the last step
before the socialistic state).

The college fraternity typifies the
free enterprise, individualism, and
spirit that is America. Step by step
emasculation of this American in-
stitution is what socialists, commun-
ists, and the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People want. Any one step now is
merely a future invitation to anoth-
er step.

W&L is standing firm against ac-
cepting general Federal aid because
of the dangers of paternalistic gov-
ernment. For the same reasons W&L
must encourage in every way the

Southern Writers Continue In Vital Faulkner Tradition

By James Boatwright, III
Instructor In English

The title of this series cannot in
all fairness apply to this particular
article. One can with some accuracy
estimate the population of Norfolk
in 1965; but there is no way of
knowing the course that literature
will take, literature of the South or
anywhere else. Nor is the specula-
tion interesting; what is interesting
and valuable is the literature we
have, the novels and poems and
plays that are part of the past and
the present. The literature of the
future we can leave to the future.

The question that is worth asking
is whether there is a vital tradition
in Southern letters today. We know
of the recent past, of Faulkner’s
greatest books, of Thomas Wolfe, of
the Agrarians. We are often told,
however, that the spirit that inspired
these writers and movements has
dissipated; the South will soon be
like the North, perhaps worse. The
social structure is changing, the
farms have been abandoned, indus-
tries are moving in and bringing
with them unionism, decent wages
and other such evils. The Southern

 

writers of today, or so we are led to
believe, inevitably reflect this
change; they are more concerned
with Freud and city planning than
with their souls and their crops.

Distorted Generalization

Such generalizations are danger-
ous because they are distorted. The
implications are that the writer is
completely the creature of his en-
vironment, and that that environ-
ment has undergone an overnight
metamorphosis. In answer to the
first, I would say that a writer is
much more than his environment,
that he has memory and imagination,
intellect and will; and he can adapt
as well as any animal. As for the
metamorphosis, the only person who
would believe that the South is not
still, in innumerable painful and
blessed ways, the South (despite
many vast changes) has simply not
lived in the South and used his eyes
and ears.

Several years ago, in separate es-
says, R. B. Heilman and Richard
Weaver isolated the salient charac-
teristics of the Southern temper,
particularly the temper of the writ-

 

er, and these characteristics hold
true for the writers of today. (It is
not likely that the Southerner will
be radically different tomorrow or
ten years from now; a temper is not
put down so easily.) Southern writ-
ing is marked by a sense of the con-
crete; the prose shows the influence
of political and pulpit rhetoric and it
shows affinities with the adecdotes
and with gossip. The total view of
life is often informed by religious
feeling and an awareness of trag-
edy. Not that non-Southern writers
might not share these feelings and
attitudes; but the Southern writer
is endowed with them according to
a particular, identifiable balance.

This temper is evident, for in-
stance, in the playwright Tennessee
Williams. Williams, for all his fash-
ionable commercial qualities, seems
to me an essentially Southern writ-
er. His best plays—A Streetcar
Named Desire; Suddenly, Last Sum-
mer; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof—de-
rive their strength from the atmos-
phere of decay and the perverted
idealism which are at least a part
of Southern life.

The novelists who use the South

 

as subject are more numerous, and
they use it in various ways. Carson
McCuller’s studies in loneliness, iso-
lation, and the need for love are
honest and painful reflections of
Southern experience. Frankie in The
Member of the Wedding records as
faithfully as Holden Caulfield the
peculiar joys and sorrows of grow-
ing up. In The Heart Is a Lonely
Hunter, Reflections in a Golden Eye,
and many of the shorter works the
dumb, the dwarfed, and the mad are
heightened, exaggerated metaphors;
their lives are ours, as Southerners
and human beings.

God Denied Or Transformed

The grotesque of Mrs. McCullers’
books are similar to the strange,
possessed country people found in
Flannery A’Connor’s two novels and
collection of stories: Wise Blood, The
Violent Bear It Away, A Good Man
Is Hard to Find. The difference is
that Miss O’Connor’s characters live
in a world of heroic and demonic
evil, a world in which God has been
denied or transformed into a funda-
mentalist God of anger and destruc-
tion. It is not a comfortable or pop-

 

ular view of life, but it is expressed
with an absolute and convincing
skill. The fact that as rationalists we
reject such a dark world indicates
all too well our place in that world.

A more realistic, commonplace
South appears in the novels of Wil-
liam Styron, a Virginian, whose first
book, Lie Down in Darkness, met
with great critical success. It is a
moving and tragic story of the life
of a Virginia family, but his second
long work, Set This House on Fire
(1960) is an even finer achievement
and is suggestive of the way in
which some Southern writers have
found to use their past. The setting
of Set This House on Fire is Italy
for the most part; the story is in
many ways a re-telling of the Don
Juan legend; the suffering of the
characters is overtly existential. But
the main characters are Southern-
ers, and their suffering and search
are strongly conditioned by their
Southern background.

Yet further evidence of the con-
tinuing vitality of Southern writing
can be found in the work of Rey-
nolds Price, who represents a new
generation, but whose first novel

 

shows the same feeling for language
and rhetoric, for place and charac-
ter, as the works of his distinguished
predecessors. A Long and Happy
Life will be published this month
simultaneously in hardcover and as
a supplement in Harper’s. It is a love
story, set in rural North Carolina,
a story of birth and death, of sorrow
and happiness.

In The Southern Tradition

It stands securely in a great tra-
dition in American letters, the tra-
dition of the South. As do most
of the works in that tradition, it
shows close observation of the con-
crete and tangible; it is a novel of
emotion, not of ideology. Its view of
life is pathetic, if not tragic; but the
tragedy and the pathos are always
touched by the comic. Finally, it
extends its meaning beyond region-
al bounds, and achieves the univer-
sality of art.

Doubtlessly there is much in the
South in need of change, much that
is cause for shame; but there is also
cause for pride, particularly pride
in its literature, both past and pres-
ent.

- Robrecht Fights For Roanoke
PAL Against Marines Monday

Ray Robrecht, Washington and Lee’s only boxer-in-resi-*
dence, will be shooting for his 12th straight win Monday night
when the Roanoke Police Athletic League boxers meet the
Camp Lejune Marines in Roanoke.

The 12-bout card begins at 8:30 in the Roanoke National
Guard Armory. Admission is $2 for ringside, and $1.50 gen-

eral admission.

The Roanoke PAL has a string of 26 straight wins going
into the Lejune match, including five over the Quantico Mar-
ines. But Robrecht says that Monday’s match will be against
“the toughest opposition we’ve met yet.”

The Lejune Marines are the Corps’ top boxing outfit.
Robrecht, a middleweight, will be facing Sam Sloan, who’s
ranked near the top in Marine Corps middleweight fighting.

 

Began in 56

Robrecht, the first serious W&L
boxer in recent years, didn’t get
interested in fighting until the sum-
mer of his senior year in high
school,

That’s when he started working
out in a Plainfield, New Jersey,
gymnasium, and slowly became not
only a fight fan, but also a fighter.

When he came to W&L in the fall
of 1956, he found an athletic pro-

gram that was still competing
against major university competi-
tion.

“T had played football and baseball
in high school,” said Robrecht, “but
I just didn’t have it against those
big schools. I was a lineman in high
school, but how much ball can a
160-pound lineman play against
big schools?”

Robrecht didn’t have much to do
with athletics in Virginia until the
spring of his freshman year.

'|been highly successful, defeating
‘|three straight opponents from
Quantico.

Then he wrote the Roanoke Times
and asked if there were any places
nearby where he could do a little
boxing. When they told him about
the highly organized PAL facilities
in Roanoke, Robrecht had found an
organization that appreciates his
talents in the ring.

He fought his first PAL fight in
1957, winning by a TKO. Since then,
he’s fought eight PAL-sponsored
fights, and won all of them.

Also, he picked up a Virginia
Golden Gloves championship in
1959.

Robrecht has been working out for
five weeks in preparation for Mon-
day night’s fight.

“That’s serious. training, of
course,” he said. “I try to stay in
pretty good shape all the time so I
won't have to push too hard before
my fights.”

Robrecht’s training preparation
includes two and a half miles of
roadwork every morning, and an
hour and a half workout in the gym
during the afternoon.

Sparring partners at W&L are
hard to find, but Robrecht has been
stepping into the handball courts
with two students, Dick Rose and
Jim Hague.

Rose, a law student, boxed at
Cornell in his undergraduate days,
and also did some armed forces box-
ing. Hague, a junior Phi Gam has
done a little boxing, but has never
fought in an organized match.

Never KO’d

In his 11-win string, Robrecht has
never been knocked down. He’s
scored three knockouts himself,
however.

Against Marine opposition, he’s

Monday night will be his tough-
est test so far, though. If he sur-
vives that one, he can start looking
forward to his next fight, an April
14 meeting with Richmond’s Billy
Crowder in the annual Sportsman
Show held in the VMI fieldhouse.

 

 

March 17 ts
Date For I-M
Track Meet

The Intra-Mural track meet will
be held on March 17, it was an-
nounced yesterday by track coach
Norm Lord.

Lord said that the I-M meet was

instead of in the fall as has been
the practice in recent years.

This change was made in order to
make the meet coincide with spring
track at W&L.

If Weather Permits

If weather permits, the meet will
be held outdoors. In case of bad
weather, the meet will take place in
the VMI field house under the su-
pervision of Coach Norm Lord and
I-M manager Joe Spivey.

Lord said that each participant in
the meet must get in at least three
pledged practices before the 17th.
In order to get recognition for prac-
tices, the entrant must contact eith-
er Lord or the track manager at
either 3, 4 or 5 p.m.

Certain time and distance require-
ments must also be fulfilled before
6 p.m., Thursday, March 15, under
the direction of either Coach Lord,
Coach McLaughlin, or Coach Rob-
erts.

They'll practice every morning in
preparation for the game against
Coach Bob McHenry’s Generals. The
W&L game will be the third outing
for the Aussies on their American
tour. Earlier, they'll meet Virginia
and Duke.

This is the first time that an Aus-
tralian lacrosse team has played in
America.

Before coming down to play the
University of Virginia on the 16th,
the team will travel to Washington
and meet President Kennedy and
other White House officials.

All the Australian players are
amateurs. Their occupations in or-
dinary life range from land survey-
ing to stock exchange operators to
motor mechanics. There’s even a
wholesale jeweller on the squad. All
of them are strictly amateurs.

Slater Wants Moderate Approach To Disarmament

(Continued from page 2)
which may be followed with great
advantage oversimplification
though it may be. It is this: Truth, if
it is discernible at all, is usually to
be found somewhere in between two
conflicting points of view. I think
this is extremely applicable to the
anomolies of the cold war.

In the case of fallout shelters, ra-
diation may very well be as deadly
a weapon as is claimed—but surely
some lives may be saved through
shelter protection, and isn’t this
possibility worth taking into ac-
count? The truth here is that we
must not downgrade the horror
which nuclear war will bring, but
we must not put our eggs in one
basket and assume that nothing can
be done if an all-out war is begun.

In the case of disarmament, it
may very well be that effective in-
spection procedures can never be
adequately established; but this
does not invalidate the truth, which
is that disarmament is of itself an
infinitely desirable goal. We should
not assume that disarmament can
never be accomplished, simply be-

cause there are practical difficulties
of inspection. Disarmament will be
much more effective if it is based on
good will and a rational decision
to survive, made even by those we
consider to be implacable enemies.
Many Americans’ realize that
their destinies are wrapped up in
those of the Russian people; why
can’t many Russians have reached
the same conclusion?

In short, I am urging that we do
begin finally to take some interest
in this most important problem.
Why, for instance, the faculty has
neglected its obligation to teach
and be itself concerned with an
awareness of this issue is not under-
standable.

And I am urging that we adopt
some moderate approach to the is-
sue both because it will facilitate a
reconciliation between those who
are already concerned and working
to concern others, and because it
comes closer to the truth which we

(1) wanted to invite Martin Luth-

Troubs Begin
‘Othello’ Show
On Wednesday

By C. C. FLIPPEN

Associate Editor

Several months of diverse,
but concentrated effort will
culminate tomorrow _ night
when the curtain rises on the
Troubadour Theatre produc-
tion of Othello.

Actors have been memorizing
lines and going through their paces;
stagehands have been building,
painting and cleaning. Not the
easiest job to be done was the ar-
ranging of the play for a modern
audience.

Had To Reduce Length
This job fell to Dr. Cecil Jones,
director of the Troubadours. His
major problem was to reduce the
length of the play. Uncut the play
would run about 3 hours 12 minutes.
“This I felt was simply too long

for most modern audiences,” Dr.
Jones said.
“American actors, especially

amateur groups, speak verse much
slower than do the English, there-
fore we had to cut it a bit more
than English productions usually
do. The overall effect of this cut-
ting has been to bring the pro-
duction time closer to Shake-
speare’s ‘two hours traffic upon
the stage’,” he said.

Total playing time is now about
2 hours 15 minutes.

To reduce the time by this much
required the elimination of about
700 lines out of a total of 3200 in
the play. “I felt it possible to do
this without hurting the play as
far as plot, theme or character de-
velopment was concerned,” Dr.
Jonues said.

Cutting Done in Steps

Careful cutting was done in a
number of steps long before the
play went into rehearsal. Dr. Jones
first went through the play to note
where repetitive passages could be
deleted. Much repetition required
for emphasis was left in. ,

“I also tried to keep the scene
sequence intact,” he said. Only two
very short scenes were taken out.
These show simply a time lapse and
are not vital to the plot.”

The next step was to cut pas-
sages which because of diction or
vocabulary would no longer be
understood. Most significant here
was the complete elimination of
the clown. “The things he said
simply wouldn’t be funny to a
modern audience,” Dr. Jones said.

Final cutting was merely a matter
of deciding relative importance. “I
then re-read the play to see if it
still made sense and that nothing
vital was missing. As we _ went
through rehearsals certain adjust-
ments and reinsertions have been
made,” he said.

Two Parts

In its final form the play will
be given in two parts. (“Most of
Shakespeare’s tragedies break very

twenty students.

However, the students were overwhelmingly in favor of
opening the Executive Committee legislative meetings to the

public and the press.

The students expressed their de-*

sire to retain in the constitution the
“permanent dismissal” clause as the
sole punishment for an Honor vio-
lation.

The proposed Senate is included in
a revised constitution submitted to
the Executive Committee by Bill
Lowry and Ben Brown, editors of
Protest.

The students were asked a series
of questions pertaining to current
and projected issues on the campus.
The students were picked at random
at locations on and off the campus
and were asked the following ques-
tions:

(1) Are you familiar with the pro-
posed Student Senate? If the an-
swer was no, then the following por-
tion of the proposed constitution was
read to the interviewee:

Article 1, Section 1: All legis-
lative powers herein granted shall
be vested in a Student Senate. The
Student Senate shall be compos-
ed of thirty elected Representa-
tives, six each to be elected from
the Freshman, Sophomore, Junior,
and Senior Classes; and six to be
elected from the Law School. At
least one student from each of the
above enumerated groups shall be
elected from the Independent Stu-
dents.

(2) Are you in favor of the pro-
posed Student Senate?

(3) Do you think Executive
Committee meetings should be
open to the public and press?

(4) What issues do you think
will be prominent in the spring
elections?

 

 

Among the valedictorian’s honors
| on the Washington and Lee campus
is the editorship of the 1962 edition
of the student yearbook. He also has
served as secretary of the student
publications beard and Zeta Beta|
Tau social fraternity. Last year, he |
was president of Phi Eta Sigma, a|
national honorary scholastic frater-
nity for freshmen. He has held de-|

: ; oe
partmental scholarships in physics

 

Are you familiar with the senate?
Yes—10
No—12
No opinion—0
Are you in favor of the senate?
Yes—l1
No—10
No opinion—1
Should EC meetings be open?
Yes—19
No—2
No opinion—1
Are you in favor of “expulsion
for a year” clause?
Yes—1
No—20
No opinion—1

 

Then, this section from the pro-
posed constitution was read to the
interviewee:

Article 3, Section 3, Part A: Up-
on receipt of a Charge of Honor
Violation the Executive Committee
shall meet in executive session to
determine whether or not the
charge as it stands constitutes a
clear violation of the Honor Code.
It shall determine at that time
whether the case, if valid, war-
rants expulsion for a year or per-
manent dismissal.

(5) Are you in favor of the “ex-
pulsion for a year” clause?

The replies to these questions
were recorded with the opinions
rendered with the answers.

The majority of the students asked
about opening the Executive Com-
mittee meetings answered in the af-
firmative saying they couldn’t see
why not; but specified that the Ex-
ecutive Committee should have the
right to call a closed session at its
discretion. This is understood in the
idea for the open meetings.

Opinion was also in the majority
concerning the “expulsion for a
year” clause. In general, all those
answering in the negative offered
the opinion that there are no degrees
of honor and that for the system to
work there must be just one penal-
ty.

When asked as to what issues
would be prominent in the spring
election, most could not think of
any particular ones and felt there
would be a rehash of old ones.

However, these issues were cited
as most likely to be dealt with in
the coming election: the Student
Senate, University dance weekends,
combo hours, rush week proposals,
the power of the faculty over the
student body, open Executive Com-
mittee meetings, conventional dress,
and the revision of the constitution.
Most frequently cited were the Stu-
dent Senate, open EC meetings and
University dance weekends.

Opinions favoring the Student
Senate proposals ranged from “more
representatives” to “will give the
students a greater opportunity to
work in student government.” John
Mills, Independent junior, thought
“the students on the Senate would
be just as qualified as the Execu-

Issues For Coming Campaign:

Reforms In Dance Sets, IFC

With the campus elections coming up in the near future,
there are several issues that might be included in the campaigns.
We hope that the ideas expressed here will be discussed for
their respective merit by the parties and perhaps that they will
be made issues in the coming contests.

1) The Executive Committee should open its legislative
sessions to the public. This would be in keeping with the basic
idea of freedom of speech. Since the Executive Committee is
elected by the Student Body and serves as their representatives,
the Student Body has a right to attend its sessions.

This would not include honor trials and the Executive
Committee could go into executive session any time that it
deemed necessary. As of now, all Executive Committee sessions
are closed both to the public and to the press. There is a
definite need for closer contact between the Executive Commit-
tee and the Student Body. We feel that the opening of their
sessions to the public would help to fulfill this need.

2) The Student Senate, as proposed would be a useless and
cumbersome body. As outlined in a proposed constitutional
draft, the senate would be made up of 30 elected representa-
tives from the Student Body. This group would be entirely too
large and we seriously question the wisdom of such a proposal.
Such a large body would be awkward and would tend to slow
the passage of needed legislation.

In addition, we ask whether there are enough interested and
qualified students to serve in such a capacity. Also, the possi-
bility exists that such a body could become shackled by its own
weight and would come to resemble our present IFC.

It has been further proposed that the non-fraternity men
be assured at least five representatives in that body. This is ab-
surd. Why should one group receive special attention and rep-
resentation? The non-fraternity vote is both active and strong
as the past campus elections will bear out. There is no need to
make a special case out of any one group.

3) With the rising costs of fraternities, the idea that the
class presidents head the four dance sets has definite merit. The
traditional cocktail party could be eliminated and would thus
save the fraternities a great deal of expense. We do not wish to
see the traditional cocktail party, or any party, abolished. How-
ever, financial considerations tend to make such a change both
practical and advisable. In addition, a greater degree of co-
ordination might be obtained by having each of the four aca-
demic classes sponsor the dance sets. This could build greater
Student Body interest in the dance sets and make them more
successful.

4) There has been set forth the idea that the President
of the IFC should be elected by the Student Body. This would
be a wise move. By placing the office of president of the IFC
up to campus election, greater interest and more qualified men
could be found. Furthermore, many of the issues that face the
IFC could be discussed in greater detail before the Student
Body as a whole. This might be a possible solution to some of
the present problems that face the IFC.

These ideas are presented for their face value. We hope
that they will create a basis for discussion in the coming elec-
tions. By taking an active point of view, greater interest will be
created and better candidates and government can result.

John Louis Zimmerman
The death of John Louis Zimmerman, a Beta Theta Pi

senior, comes as a tragic blow to Washington and Lee Univer-
sity.

Those students who were fortunate enough to have known
him will surely feel the sorrow caused by his death. The Stu-
dent Body has suffered a sincere loss as the result of the death
of one of its finest members.

 

 
   

Wal Geaduate Hopes
Race Trouble Will End

To the Editor:

In Seattle, Washington, any issue
involving racial trouble in the South
is sure to get nearly as much at-
tention in the newspapers as an or-
bital flight. Towards the question
of segregation there is an attitude
of disbelief and indignance that
such a social institution could still
exist in America.

To the credit of most of the people
I have met in this city and at the
University of Washington, they have
shown intelligence and sympathetic
respect in asking about the problems
of the South and the Southern view
of segregation. There are others,
however, and I met several at a
“freedom rider” rally today, who are
convinced that the South is so back-
ward and its intellectuals so passive
that they themselves must take the
initiative in exposing the evils of

segregation and in showing South-
erners the errors of their ways.

That the racial issue is hurting
the South and the country as a
whole is undeniable. One of my
graduate school friends who is a na-
tive of Nigeria has told me that by
far the most powerful propaganda
weapon of the Soviet Union and
communism in Africa is the exist-
ence of racial discrimination and in-
stances of racial violence in the
South.

It seems that this should be an
issue of great concern in the best
and most influential Southern uni-
versities. How much better would it
be for the South and the United
States for educated Southerners to
actively face the problem with a de-
termination to do something about it
rather than leave it to lean and be-

It Might, If West Helps

 

Can Greedy Red Bear Eat Too Much?

By DR. MILTON COLVIN

Associate Professor of
Political Science
“The mistake of all those who
organize armies or set political
policies is to mistake the momen-
tary for the permanent State.”
Hans von Seeckt

Anyone who makes the habit
of reading the Daily Report of the
Foreign Broadcast Information
Service or the State Department
Intelligence Bulletins or, for that
matter, Little Orphan Annie, real-
izes that the world is a slippery
and shifty thing and surprises do
happen.

What is posted as true today
maybe untrue tomorrow and may-
be was false from the very be-
ginning. Information gallops and
we, the citizens walk. Still, some
guesses should be made.

The Soviet Union is not entirely
able to limit its struggle to its op-
en political enemies. It has troub-
le with its “friends” and neigh-
bors in Eastern Europe and well
it should.

Mr. Churchill has pointed out
that those restive groups, The
Czechs, The Poles, The Hungari-
ans, The Slovaks, and The Croats,
once so eager to leave the Haps-
burg Empire and be on their own
have in recent years “suffered
the tortures which mediaevel
theologians usually reserved for
the damned.” This is another way
of saying that they have been
swallowed up by Communism.

Is there any chance that the
Russian Bear will choke on this
meal? Well, perhaps. If we in the
West keep our head and some
modesty as to just how big and
tough we are, we may even help
these unfortunate Eastern and
Central Europeans to make life
more troublesome for Khrushchev
& Co.

Let us tally some facts: Poland
has 28 million people, Czechoslo-
vakia has 14 million, Hungary has
10 million Rumania has 18 million
and Bulgaria 8 million. Add to this
the 18 million of Yugoslavia and
an equal number now walled in
in East Germany and the total
comes out to about 115 million
persons for the Soviets to sit on,
and it is still true that you can
do almost anything with a bay-
onet but sit on it. These 115 mil-
lion persons are the natural al-
lies of the West, geography to the
contrary. All have known a stand-
ard of living higher than the Rus-
sians and all have known more
freedom than what they know
now. The future for them, there-
fore, is a continuing loss. And
they know it.

It can be argued, of course, that
while the old generation of East-
ern Europe remembers “better
days,” the young’ generation
knows only what it is told and it
is told just exactly when the Com-
munist press cares to present.
Such argument overlooks the fact
that the revolt in East Germany
in 1953, the revolt (or near re-
volt) in Poland in 1955, and the
exploding fire of Budapest in the
Fall of 1956, were all basically the
work of young men, those who ac-
cording to Communist doctrine
“should have known better.”

More than one half of the last
arrivals out of East Germany
prior to August 13th when the
Berlin wall went up were under
21 years of age. The belief of the
“captured youth” has been pret-
ty thoroughly demolished. This
is not to say that given enough
time the Communists will not win
over the young, but at the mo-
ment, at least, the game is going
the other way.

It is not, however, the point of
this short piece that Eastern and
Central Europe are pro-West be-
cause they have tough economic

     
   
 
  
       
   
   
   
        
   

going or because they resent
muzzled presses and controlled
thinking. Some of this was not en-
tirely new to them before the
coming to power. Rather, I wish
to make the point that these “cap-
tive nations” are pro-West for the
simple and basic reason that they
are part of the West. Culturally
they belong. And have for a
thousand years. With the excep-
tion of the Serbs and the Bulgars
who have historically, but not re-
cently, regarded the Russians as
friends, all the others have a long
tradition of not getting along with
their big neighbor to the East. The
Poles, the Czechs, the Slovaks, the
Hungarians and the Coats are Ro-
man Catholics and since the great
schism of 1055 have regarded
themselves as defenders of West-
ern Culture against both Mongols
and the Orthodox Church of Rus-
sia. By faith they are oriented to-
ward Rome, not Moscow. We in
the West will be well cautioned to
treat these Central European Na-
tions as part of our own heritage.
It would be a calamity to regard

rope.

articles by members of the Washington

them as “distant people about
whom we know but little’—to
quote an unfortunate remark of
the late Prime Minister Chamber-
lain at the time of the Munich
Crisis. It is to keep this trust alive,
rather than to bluster with slo-
gans such as “Liberation” and
“rollback” which we have clearly
demonstrated we are not pre-
pared to back up, that should be
the paramount task of Western
Foreigy Policy. (It is worth not-
ing that if the United States did
intervene in the satellites of Cen-
tral and Eastern Europe either
through large scale delivery of
arms to patriot groups or direct
military intervention in their sup-
port, a general nuclear war would
most certainly result!).

Granted that no Russian Gov-
ernment given the pathological
fear of the Russian people about
invasion from the West, can we
allow the satellites to fall into un-
friendly or even neutral hands?
How can this be done if military
action is ruled out? In part it can
be accomplished by letting the

  

Communists hang themselves on
a rope of their own making. So-
viet agriculture policy wherever
applied, is an unbroken series of
disasters. The satellites are bas-
ically agrarian nations. Ideologi-
cal unity and party dogma are
poor substitutes for commonsense
down on the farm. It seems a fair
guess that “strict application of
communist principles of land re-
form” or even the flexible brand
of Khrushchev & Co. will only
increase the harvest of hatred and
doubt that the Eastern Europeans
already have. There is little evi-
dence to show that the Soviets
are winning friends at the mo-
ment.

All of this is, of course, a vic-
tory won at the expense of our
supporters. Obviously there is a
point of diminishing return on
this. Something POSITIVE has to
be done and from our side. And it
is here that we can take the of-
fensive by intelligent use of mass
media of communication. Radio
Free Europe at its best (it was
at its worst in 1956) is a powerful
and effective weapon against
Communism. Other ways of
the Iron Curtain have been pre-
sented in an aide-memoire to the
White House by David Sarnoff,
President of NBC. Ideas, unlike
rockets and bombs, are easily
smuggled over borders and quick-
ly passed along.

All of the once proud capitals
of Central and Eastern Europe,
Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, Buch-
arest, Sofia are in the Communist
Camp. We cannot in a military
sense fight to get them free of it.
But we can in a cultural sense
keep in touch and we can wait
and use time wisely and hope the
Soviets will use it unwisely, and
perhaps in this way something can
be done to make Khrushchev
lessen his tight grip. In any case,
we are back to our opening point
that the momentary is not the per-
manent state of affairs and this in
itself means the game can go our
way.

‘Red Ties, Socks, Collar Buttons

Label Socalist Profs’ -- Craven

By THORN CRAVEN

Tuesday Columnist
In the Friday Edition last week
there was a letter to the editor
which interested me very much. I’m
not referring to
the one about the
IFC, but the one
from the alumnus
which points out
the socliaistic ten-
dencies which are
becoming evident

the problem. I think that it would be
better to inform you of some of the
things to watch for in professors
who might be suspected of leftist
leanings. Keep your eyes peeled for
these sure fire signs, and we can
avoid that taint of our reputation
which has become so harmful to
places like Berkley and Harvard.

One of the biggest give aways
that _ socialist-leaning-professors
are apt to show is that of clothes.

 

They like to be subtle, so they do
not wear red blazers, or pants
or anything like that. They do,
however, have a weakness for red
ties and collar buttons. Red tee-
shirts are popular among the less
dogmatic socialists, for they give a
slight pink cast to a white shirt.
Be careful not to jump to conclu-
sions in sighting a red tie, how-
ever, but wait until repeated

out in the open, I do not feel that
I can remain silent about a prob-

By GEORGE HONTS
Tuesday Columnist

With the intent of relieving tensions and possibly cureing
some of the controversies which beset the student body and the
University at this time, I should like to propose that the fol-
lowing frivilous, ridiculous, and worthless proposals be adopted.

If accepted, they may solve all our problems so we can get
back to our primary objective of being here—passing the
round of tests which face us before Spring Vacation.

I have endeavored to cover every*—
area of controversy and come up
with the “best” solution possible.
My proposals are:

 

document since they are better in-
formed than one or two individuals.
The results should be gratifying.

(4) Since the faculty has been
declared “socialistic”? we should
provide them with facilities for
communal living. Such an ar-
rangement would cut their living
costs, thus allowing the Univer-
sity to cut their salaries, By doing
this the University would have
more money to apply to its build-
ing program. Any professor who
would refuse to forsake wife and
family for communal living should
be burned in effigy and sent to
Princeton for rehabilitation.

(1) Sign Martin
Luther King to
appear at Spring
Dances. By doing
this, King would
be guaranteed a
full house, since
- there is nothing
else to do, and we
would all get to
hear what the
' man has to say.

; (2) Next year,
ane let Coach McHen-
ry write for the R-t P and hire
Steve Henry to coach the basketball
team. In a constant search for jus-
tice, I cannot help but feel that
turn-about is fair play.

(3) Have the Student Body re-
write the constitution and submit it
to Protest for approval. Certainly
such a committee-at-large would be
better able to handle the multitude
of problems involved in that sacred

   

(5) There are two possible solu-
tions for the “fraternity” problem.
A) depledge and deactivate all the
fraternity men and make them
NFU’s. Send all the present non-fra-
ternity men to Williams. Or B) ev-
ery four years initiate the freshmen
class into the various houses and
declare open rush on upperclassmen.

Baseballers Play Elon, Norfolk,
South Carolina On Spring Trip

By HARRY MEEM
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team heads south this year on their
traditional Spring Vacation practice
trip with a veteran team, some
good freshmen, and prayers for hon-
est umpires.

This is all as usual. But the sit-
uation is different this year as

Captain Ned Hobbs

regards the caliber of competition
the Generals will face.

For the first time in some twenty
years, the Generals will be playing
nothing but college ball clubs. Gone

 

from the schedule are such oppon-
ents as Fort Gordon and the Parris
Island Marines.

Army Tough

The practice of playing service
clubs as a warmup to the regular
season originated with Cap’n Dick
Smith, longtime baseball coach and
athletic director here. In recent
years the Generals haven’t fared
too well against the big boys.

Last year, for example, they lost
three games of three at Fort Gordon,
Georgia, which Coach Lyles terms
“the Baltimore Orioles’ Youth Club”
since many of the post’s pitchers
were part of that team’s chain.

The year before that, the Gen-
erals ran into tough sledding at
Parris Island, playing Cornell and
the Marines. This was the trip in
which they had two no-hitters
thrown at them in one day, one by
a Marine righthander, the other
by a pair of Cornell southpay’s.

According to athletic director Cy

Twombly there are two main rea-
sons why the Generals couldn’t get
service competition this spring. First
he blames rumored criticism of the
posts for overemphasizing baseball;
second, there’s no room left on any
of the bases for housing a visiting
ball club.

Formation of the four-member
Collegiate Athletic Conference was
announced in January by W&L
President Fred C. Cole. Members
have athletic programs similar to
Washington and Lee’s non-subsidiz-
ed system.

Washington and Lee has held no
conference memberships since it
withdrew from the Southern Con-
ference in 1958.

Traditional state games with
Hampden-Sydney, Randolph-Macon,
and Emory and Henry will be play-
ed this year.

Besides Southwestern, a second
opponent is listed on the schedule.
A home game on September 29 be-
tween W&L and Lebanon Valley
College of Annville, Pa., will be the
first meeting of the two schools.

W&L Announces Grid Slate;
Add New Conference Teams

Lebanon Valley’s head coach is W&L
alumnus and former center Bill Mc-
Henry, brother of the Generals’
basketball coach, Bob McHenry.

Southwestern and Lebanon Val-
ley replace Frederick College and
Washington University of St.
Louis from the 1960 schedule.

Returning foes for 1962 also in-
clude Johns Hopkins and Franklin
and Marshall, both Lexington games.

The Generals will carry a 19-game
unbeaten streak into their first en-
counter next season when they meet
Hampden-Sydney. Last year, W&L
posted a 9-0-0 record in the eighth
year of the university’s non-sub-
sidized athletic program.

Prose entries may be short stories,
literary criticisms, biographical stu-
dies, plays, or informal essays, at
least 1500 words in length. Poems
must be at least 30 lines, which may
consist of selections.

Last year two junior prose awards
were given, to Bond Johnson and
Ron Alenstein; an exception was
made to allow both to receive
awards. The freshman prose award
was won by Paul Van Avery, and
no sophomore prose award was
made. Poetry awards were won by
William Chaplin and C. P. White.

The Mahan Awards were estab-

Friday the Generals meet the Pi-
rates of East Carolina College in
Greenville, N. C. Saturday they
play the Monarchs of Norfolk Col-
lege, in Norfolk.

Only three games of the spring
trip, the ones with Elon, East Car-
olina, and Norfolk, will count in
the season’s record. This suits team
coach Joe Lyles just fine.

“IT look at it this way,” Lyles
said. “We’re naturally playing to
win, but this trip is the only chance
I've got to see what some of these
boys can do in a game before we
get down to regular season play.

Competition
“We'd rather play South Caro-
lina than some of the smaller

schools because it’s better competi-
tion. I want to see what they can
do under fire.”

He’ll have very little chance to
see that before the Generals leave.
There’s a scrimmage scheduled for
Saturday against VMI, weather and
the condition of the fields permitting.
Springfield (Massachusetts) College
comes into town next week to play
both the local college teams as often
as possible in a week’s time. They'll
scrimmage against the Generals and
the Keydets in what amounts to
their southern trip.

Lyles expects to go into both
contests in fairly good shape as
far as the team goes. The boys
haven't been outside much, and
this is a crying need, but with luck
and some sunshine they'll move
out soon.,

The only other thing the coach
is bemoaning is the fact that he
has just two catchers, senior Jim
Russ and freshman Ashley Allen.
He’d like to find at least one more
backstop, and a few more pitchers,
before the long haul starts.

Best Solution Is To Think

(Continued from page 2)

Certainly men who have been here
for 2-3-4 years know which houses
they are interested in and the fresh-
men won’t know each other well
enough to permit dirty rush to go
on. Another advantage of this
change is that Help Week could be
moved to the time slot now occupied
by Freshman Camp, thus eliminat-
ing two probable evils from the
present calendar.

6) Give unlimited cuts to all men
who made less than a 1.0 grade-point
average and allow Dean’s List stu-
dents to have no cuts at all. The
point of this change is obvious.

Now. Anyone who sees any

sense in these six ideas is an ob-
vious candidate for the nut house.
However, they are not a lot more
ridiculous than some of the gales
of hot air which have been floating
about for the past month or six
weeks. May I suggest a motto for
the day? THINK.

Next week I hope to have a solu-
tion for the week-end weather
problem.

Label Faculty

is often a big clue to their subcon-
scious thoughts. If you happen to be
tailing some professor and he shows
a marked tendency to turn left at
every corner, you should make note
of it. This is particularly dangerous
if the left turns are taken into one
way streets, for a traffic hazzard is
almost as bad as a political one.

Of course, the most likely place
to spot a potential plotter against
the government, university, fra-
ternities, and McCrum’s is the class-
room. Here is where professors give
themselves away most easily. For it
is hard for them to keep their true
leanings out of the lectures. This
is also the hardest place to catch
them, however, for it involves list-
ening to the lectures. I do not rec-
ommend this for freshmen, for all
too often lack of experience affords
the slippery socialist a loop hole.

The last place revolutionary fer-
ment is likely to be detected is,
unfortunately, inaccessable to stu-
dent spies. This, of course, is the
faculty meetings. Therefore, it is
always to be alert at the Co-op
and Doc’s where these meetings
are most likely to be continued.

I can not encourage you in hunt-
ing down subversive looking profes-
sors too much. And I can not let you
go on thinking that they do not
exist here at good old W&L. So get
out and start searching. Remember
that there was even a chink in the

he was initiated into Phi Eta Sig-
ma, and he later received the chem-
istry achievement award as well as
a chemistry research grant.

As a sophomore this year, Cravens
received the physics achievement
award and was also initiated into
Alpha Epsilon Delta, honorary pre-
med fraternity. He serves as comp-
troller of SPE, is publicity director
of the Glee Club, and has been ac-
tive in the Graham-Lee Literary
Society.

In each of his three semesters at
W&L Cravens has compiled a per-
fect 3.0 grade point average.

Galef Offers Plan To Eliminate
Dance Presidents, Revamp IFC

By LARRY MEEKS

Proposals to eliminate the dance
set presidents and to have the IFC
President elected by all fraternity
men were made by Senior Execu-
tive Committeeman Steve Galef in
Monday night’s EC meeting.

Under Galef’s plan, class presi-
dents will replace dance set presi-
dents. The office of President of
Fancy Dress, however, will be re-
tained. The second proposal is aimed
at correcting some of the current
problems of the IFC.

Both of these proposals will prob-
ably be voted on in the EC meeting
next Monday night. If they pass the
EC, they will be voted upon by the
student body this spring and, if
passed, will go into effect next
spring.

Under the new dance plan, the
President of the Junior class along
with the other officers and any vice
presidents that he might need would
be responsible for Openings. The
Sophomore President and his group
would be responsible for Springs,
and the Senior Class President and
his group for Finals.

 

The Senior Class President was
chosen for Finals because, as of this
year, Finals will be planned espec-
ially for Seniors but open to the
entire student body.

To Retain Fancy Dress

The office of President of Fancy
Dress will probably be retained be-
cause, as Galef said on behalf of
the Dance Board, “We feel that the
President of Fancy Dress should be
retained to insure the continuation
of the Fancy Dress traditions. We
also feel that he should be elected
along with the student body officers
each spring.”

Galef gave the following reasons
for the proposed change:

1. Under the present system, the
Presidents of the dance sets have
little to do and find it difficult to
get cooperation from the students.
We hope that this proposal would
help eliminate this problem.

2. It would give class officers con-
crete projects and make them some-
thing more than stepping stones for
those with political aspirations.

3. It is hoped that such a change
would create a certain amount of

 

Big Business At W&L: Student
Groups Handle $60,000 Yearly

By STEVE SMITH

Washington and Lee student or-
ganizations handled over $60,000 last
year, according to figures released
yesterday by Sam Rayder, vice-
president of the Rockbridge Nation-
al Bank and treasurer of student
body funds.

The 1961-61 total of $62,695.65 is
approximated each year by the Pub-
lications Board, Dance Board, and
the EC, Rayder said.

The Calyx, Ring-tum Phi, South-
ern Collegian, and Dance Board all
showed profits at the end of the
1960-61 school year according to the
W&L Student Body Fund Financial
Report. At the beginning of this
school year the Publications Board
had a reserve fund of $8,141.62; the
Dance Board reserve stood at $5,-
352.24; and the EC was credited with
$4,621.47. These savings have been
accumulated over the past 30 years.
Rayder invests the reserve funds
for the student body in local mort-
gage loans and United States bonds.

All the money is spent through
Rayder.

Each fall the student body pro-
vides a basis of operations for its
officers and editors when it pays the
campus tax. The tax, which last year
was $10.07, was cut to $10.00 this

year, and totaled $11,990.00, said
Rayder.
Each organization except the

Dance Board receives a fixed pro-
portion of the fee. The Calyx is giv-
en over half the total, and the Ring-

tum Phi about a fourth. The re-|

 

mainder is split among the South-
ern Collegian, the EC, the cheer-
leaders, and the Student Bar Asso-
ciation. 1960 was the last year the
Debate Team received a share of the
tax.

The Dance Board relies solely on
subscriptions to the dance plan for
its start in the fall.

The 1960-61 campus tax gave the
Calyx $6,535.20. Another $6,250.00
was brought in by the sale of pic-
tures. Advertising brought $2,055.00,
and sale of books $380.00. This gave
the yearbook a total budget of $15,-
220.20, of which $948.57 was left in
the Publications Board fund after
all costs were paid.

The 1960-61 Ring-tum Phi receiv-
ed $3,010.86 from the campus tax,
$2,028.75 from subscriptions, and
$3,932.80 from advertising, After all
disbursements, $634.51 was _ trans-
ferred to the Publications Board
fund.

The Southern Collegian collected
$1,190.34 from the campus tax, $104.-
94 from subscriptions, and $1,735.97
from advertising. After its expenses
the humor magazine turned in $328.-
87 to the Publications Board fund.

The Dance Board sold 762 dance
plans, clearing $17,499.34 after giv-
ing $1,374.46 to the Dance Board
fund. Door receipts added $896.00.
With this budget the Board spent
$4,399.48 on Openings, $6,370.35 on
Fancy Dress; $4,628.63 on Springs;
and $2,888.38 on Finals.

The EC received a total of $657.70
from the campus tax and the Stu-

 

dent Body Fund. All of this amount
was spent for Honor Case expen-
ses, printing and supplies, and mis-
cellaneous expenses.

The cheerleaders and the debate
team were allotted only $58.35 each
from the campus tax. The Student
Bar Association received $116.70
from the tax.

The Student Body Reserve Fund,
which does not include finances of
the Publications or Dance Boards,
showed $4,621.47 on September 4,
1961.

The IFC, which operates under
Rayder but apart from the other or-
ganizations, spent $2,442.60 last year,
most of which was provided by
freshman rush fees.

Ray Robrecht, student body vice-
president, holds authority over the
funds at the student end. Although
the Publications and Dance Boards
operate autonomously, the student
body constitution says both must be
amenable to the EC in their policies.

In his capacity as student body
treasurer, Rayder has spent more
time in extra-curricular activities
than any student. A W&L gradute,
he was the first and only student to
serve as treasurer. He has held the
job ever since.

As a freshman he took a job
with the Rockbridge Bank. Now he
is a vice-president and trust of-

ficer of the bank.

Until 1955 Rayder was also finan-
cial adviser to all fraternities. He
still serves as adviser to his own
house, Sigma Chi.

class spirit and unity which is lack-
ing under the present system. Per-
haps, such a move would lead to
other class projects.

4. It is also hoped that such a
change would create a greater in-
terest in the dance sets themselves
and involve more students in their
preparations.

The IFC President

The proposal to make the office
of IFC President elective will also
be voted on at next week’s meeting.

It is Galef’s opinion that “He
(the IFC President) would certainly
have more prestige, as the election
would be held along with the elec-
tions for the “Big Three.”

Another advantage of this pro-
propocal, according to Galef, is that
men could run for office on a defi-
nite platform and the president
would be elected more on qualifica-
tions and views than along the 10-8
party split.

It is also felt that the proposal,
if passed, would generate greater
interest on the part of the student
body in the IFC. The EC would
still retain the power to name the
President’s replacement if he should
become unable to serve for any
reason.

The office would be open to any
upperclassman in a fraternity. The
constitution now states that the
president must have previously serv-
ed on the IFC, but such a qualifi-
cation would probably not be nec-
essary as the candidates would prob-
ably be running on experience.

Galef said the EC would like to
have opinions or suggestions from
any interested members of the stu-
dent body before these proposals
come up for a vote.

The remaining officers of the IFC
would be elected by that group at
the beginning of each school year.

Televised Meet

By LARRY MEEKS

Al Eckes, Bill Noell, and Bill
Boardman, debating for W&L de-
feated a North Carolina team on an
hour-long televised debate Monday
night.

The program was broadcast live
from Chapel Hill to an audience of
some quarter million people. The
W&L team took the affirmative side
of the debate topic: That the U.S.
should withdraw from the United
Nations.

W&L was awarded the decision by
a panel of three judges. Previously,
the North Carolina team had de-
feated Duke University in a similar
debate on the same program.

The W&L victory entitles them to
return to Chapel Hill for a second
televised debate on April 9.

The subject of the debate and the
opponent has not yet been named,
although there is a possibility that
the opponent will be Davidson Col-
lege.

Mr. Chaffin said he hopes to
schedule an intercollegiate debate
on the W&L campus to give the
home fans a chance to see the var-
sity debaters in action. Meanwhile
interested students may see debates
on various subjects at the Forensic
Union meetings.

been published by two different
journals.

A story entitled “I Wonder As I
Wander” by Jack B. Moore has been
included in the current issue of the
New Mexico Quarterly. His second
article, “David Morgan and the In-
dians,” appears in the January is-
sue of the West Virgina History
Magazine,

The fiction piece deals with an
itinerant minister in West Virginia
while the second story traces the
origin of the folktale about the West
Virginia hero David Morgan.

A member of the Washington and
Lee faculty since 1960, Moore re-
ceiveed his bachelor of arts degree
from Drew University in 1955 and
his M.A. degree from Columbia Uni-
versity in 1955. He currently is
working on his Ph.D. from the Uni-

 

 

versity of North Carolina.

* Each of the news heads announced

plans to improve the Calyx. Payne
said his main objective will be “to
put more life into the yearbook.”
Boardman has made plans to run
the Calyx in a more businesslike
manner.

Payne said that the theme for
his book will center around the
university crest and motto: “Not
unmindful of the future.” He will
tie in the motto with a theme of
university progress.

The new editor announced a ten-
tative staff headed by Cotton Rawls
and Syd Butler, managing editors.

Other staff members will be Vic
Galef and Buck Ogilvie, classes edi-
tors; Barry Greene, organization
editor; Jay Caplan and Arthur
Sheer, fraternities editors; Chuck
Lane and John Madison, athletics
editors; Dick Copelan, administra-
tion editor; and Dick Spenser,
features editor.

Boardman has a plan to keep the
Calyx records on the IBM machine
in order to improve accuracy and
completeness. He intends to put
more pictures of law students and
non-fraternity men in the book.

Next year’s business manager said
he also will increase the amount of
advertising in the Calyx by careful
campaigning.

A tentative business staff of four
was announced: in-town ad manager,
Jerry Turner; out-of-town ad man-
ager, Mack Applefeld; office man-
ager, Dillard Munford; studio man-
ager, Phil Lemon.

Payne, vice president of the jun-
ior class, will be one of the tri-cap-
tains of the football team next fall.
He is a dormitory counselor.

Boardman, junior class historian,
is one of the state’s outstanding de-
baters.

Psi Chi Elects

Dr. William Hinton, professor of
psychology, announced today that
seven students have been elected
to Psi Chi, the National Honorary
Society in Psychology.

The students are James H. Austin,
Jr., Stephen Chernay, John Har-
court, Jr., George Hickam, Robert
Lewis, Donald McClure, and Robert
Stone.

In order to qualify, these students
have had to take at least nine se-
mester hours of psychology and
made a grade within the upper third
of all undergraduates enrolled in

Strengthen

Class Ties

The suggestion that one dance weekend be administered
by the junior class, and one by the seniors, seems to us to have
considerable merit. It would strengthen class ties and make class
presidencies more meaningful offices. The elected Dance Set
presidents have done very competent jobs but their respon-
sibilities do not compare with the three student body officers
with whom they are elected now. Nor does it seem to us that
a dance set presidency is an appropriate stepping stone to a
student body office, as they often are at present.

Steve Galef’s ideas on this point deserve careful consid-
eration. As president of the Dance Board he is more familiar
with the problems of the dance sets than anyone else in school.
We hope the student body and the Executive Committee will

give them a full discussion.

Troubs Deserve Praise

The heavy sales for this week’s Troubadour performances
of “Othello” point to the fine job that Dr. Cecil Jones and his

student actors are doing. Dr. Jones’s enthusiasm and compe-

tence, together with the hard

work and talent of men like

Troub President John Dunnell have given W&L a theatre of
which we can be very proud. We look for them to make a con-
tinued contribution to the University’s intellectual life.

A Trend Toward Mediocrity

Congratulations to Bob Payne and Bill Boardman on their
elections as editor and business manager of the Calyx. They
will have their work cut out for them. We have hopes that the
1962 Calyx, which will not appear for a couple more months,
will reverse the trend toward mediocrity which has been ap-
parent the past few years. If Joe Goldstein does it this year,

Payne will find his job easier.

College yearbooks have traditionally been an opportunity
for men with graphic or literary talent to show their stuff. In
the past few years, however, the Calyx has been untouched by
talent of any kind. The editorial staff has exhibited all the
worst characteristics of a bureaucracy. It will take several years,
no doubt, to build the yearbook back up to the W&L stand-
ards of ten years ago and several more to raise it to the plane
of the best contemporary annuals at other colleges. But we wish
New Editor Payne all the luck in the world. We are sure he'll

provide the necessary hard work.

The South In The Sixties...

 

Growing Ind

By DR. STANLEY T. LOWRY

The observer of the national econ-
omy is immediately struck by the
fact that economic activity is not ev-
enly spread throughout the country
like water in a shallow pan. Instead
one finds economic activity, and
particularly industrial activity, con-
centrated in clusters like droplets
of water on a highly waxed table
top, resisting the pull of uniform dis-
persion by surface tension.

The forces that tend to hold in-
dustry where it is, and those that
tend to draw it to new places are
better understood as developmental
rather than equilibrating forces.
For purposes of general discussion,
these elements can be abstracted
theoretically with more clarity if the
highly varied detail of individual in-
dustries is dispensed with.

Types of Locational Pulls
on Industry

The first and most obvious stim-
ulus to location of industry is the
pull of mineral deposits which tend
to be unevenly distributed on the
earth’s crust. Agricultural soils
which produce important cash
crops have a similar character and
provide a base for extractive indus-
tries. Their main character is that
they require a significant part of the
production to be located at the
source of the raw material.

From the point of view of econ-
omic development, however, there
are a number of severe drawbacks
to this type of industry. Much of the
work that must be performed at the
source of supply is highly unskilled;

 

or, by the same token, it can be per-

formed by heavy machinery so that
income brought into the area is in
the form of low wages or royalties
which are usually too thinly or too
concentratedly disbursed to achieve
a significant development impact on
the economy.

Too often, with the depletion of
natural resources subject to extrac-
tive development, an area is left
with a poorer resource base, a dis-
located agrarian economy, but with,
if fortunate, an improved transpor-
tation system. This was the case in
much of the South where commer-
cial agriculture and_ shortsighted
forestry developed resources and
depleted them, leaving no significant
progress toward industrialization in
their wake except improved trans-
portation facilities.

The flourishing chemical industry
on the Louisiana and Texas coasts,
however, exemplifies an extractive
industry whose general area of loca-
tion has been so stable for a suffici-
ently long period combined with
certain legal pressures and techno-
logical developments so that secon-
dary processing, by-products, and
finally finished goods have been
drawn to the raw material source,
and the extractive oil industry there
has served as a developmental stim-
ulus of great significance.

‘Gregarious” Industries

The second type of industry with
which we are concerned are the
“gregarious” industries, i.e., those
that tend to locate where others al-
ready are located. Almost all small
industries, particularly those em-
ploying skilled labor, find the pro-

 

 

TROUBADOURS PRESENT ‘OTHELLO’

 

Allen Re-Creates Timeless Hero

By MAC McCLUNG

In the opening night performance
of Shakespeare’s Othello Wednes-
day, the actors and actresses of
the Troubadour Theatre wrought
from this brilliant tragedy a living
reproduction of the vitality and life
which is contained in Shakespeare’s
verse.

As a tragedy of jealousy and re-
venge, Othello presented us with
characters of high motivation and
a wide range of emotions. Bob Al-
len, playing the title role, built
from scene to scene the figure of
a man whose whole soul was
wracked with auguish, pity, rage,
and revenge.

We saw him first as a calm, trust-
ing, and self assured warrior-groom,
happy in his new estates and al-
most boyishly exuberant. His trans-
formation from that character into
the tortured monster was more than
convincing. We felt, with him, the
painful growth of the seed of jeal-
ousy planted by Iago; and while
Othello wept and roared as he
moved toward final destruction, the
timeless universality of Shakes-

 

peare’s character came home to us
because Bob Allen brought it there.

Dunnell’s Performance

John Dunnell, as Iago, matched
Othello action for action. Lacking
the simple emotional appeal of Oth-
ello, Iago presented his audience
a soul filled with evil and a mask
worn in cunning. He too, met his
audience, and throughout the first
half of the play, Where Iago car-
ries the emotional impact of the ac-
tion, his revenge and plottings, how-
ever evil found identity. The villain,
even in Shakespeare, can be stereo-
typed; this seems to be especially
true in Othello, where the villain’s
role is the choice part for the dis-
play of the actor. In this production,
the role did display the actor; but
more important, the actor filled his
role and gave Iago the base egoism
that made him a villain so realistic
and so hated.

Lisa Tracy as Desdemona brought
a freshness and spirit of love and
innocence and youth to her role. She
brought to us a Desdemona who ra-
diated with the love and joy and
happiness of youth as well as the

 

courage and faith of maturity. In
the scene in which she sings the
famous Willow Song, she brought
her character to a perfect point, a
plateau on which her fullness was
sustained to the point of her death
in the final scene.

Colvin Convincing

Cassio, portrayed by Steven Col-
vin, was dramatically convincing.
The role is that of a gentleman, not
by our standards, but by those of
Shakespeare; a character of noble
ideals. His veneration of Desde-
mona and his loyalty to his gov-
ernment and Othello earn that ti-
tle for him. His idealism was never
contrived or unnatural, and in this
respect Steve Colvin triumphed in
his role and made even his gen-
tlemanly shame convincing. He
seemed a man of another era and
the fact that he returned, with life,
is to the credit of the actor.

Tim Morton’s performance as
Roderigo was excellent; lured by
Iago into a false hope that his love
for Desdemona is to be realized and
maneuvered and used by Iago as a
tool in the latter’s revenge, his

 

Slater, Quoting “Lonely Crowd,”
Calls W&L Men Other-Directed

By HOWARD SLATER

The Lonely Crowd by David Ries-
man is a highly perceptive analysis
of contemporary society in Ameri-
ca; and, although the thought may
not be new, its findings about the
whole of American society can be
observed also on the W&L campus—
and probably on most college cam-
puses in the U.S. for that matter.

In the belief that the attempt may
prove instructive, I would like to
state some parallels to Reisman’s
observations. At the same time, I
want to make clear that I am not
adopting the cautious approach
with objective, scientific sociolo-
gists seem prone to take. There is no
sense in being inconclusive when
I firmly believe not that there may
be a fundamental similarity between
contemporary “other-directed” so-

ustries

cess of economic activity “better
oiled” in areas where a great many
other industries are already located.
This characteristic of efficiency and
convenience in shipping, hiring,
maintenance, etc., are aspects of the
surface tension effect mentioned
above that tend to hold industry in
pre-existing centers.

The virtue of this process is that
once an area starts developing, it
tends to re-enforce its own ex-
pansion. This hope of “breaking
through” into the “drawing card
league” is the hope of all moderate
sized cities trying to induce indus-
try to locate in their area. This char-
acteristic is the force behind the
rapid urbanization of the nation, na-
tionally classed as 70 per cent ur-
ban, but only 60 per cent in the
southeastern (Sixth Federal Re-
serve District) and 40 per cent in
Mississippi.

Many southern cities which cur-
rently exhibit rapid growth have
reached this category and are draw-
ing industry, but the development
concept must be kept in mind since
new industry or new branch plants
rather than “moved industry” char-
acterize much of this growth.

Market-Oriented Business

The third type of industry is the
highly market oriented business that
is under heavy economic pressure
to produce as close to the market as
possible because of high transpor-
tation costs of the finished product
compared to the raw materials, or
the highly personal nature of service
industries. These also re-enforce ur-
banization, and they go to places

(Continued on page four)

 

ciety and the W&L student body,
but that there actually and object-
ively is such a similarity.

Riesman defines “other-direction”
as a social character which is prim-
arily sensitive and attuned to the
attitudes, thoughts, and emotions
of others. In fact, the attitudes and
values of the other-directed indi-
vidual are determined for the most
part by those around him. This
present period of other-directedness
is distinguished from all previous
eras during which the predominant
social character—the normal social
responses—were directed either by
tradition (tradition-directed) or by
internalized values (inner-directed).

No Value Judgments, Please

Two comments concerning this
definition are in order here: One
is that the other two types of so-
cial character are found in our so-
ciety; but it is the other-directed
type which is most numerous. And
two, it is foolish to make value
judgments about the relative worth
of the types of social character on
the basis of this fundamental de-
finition. Other-directedness, for in-
stance, can be valued most highly
by those who put a premium on
consideration for others and human-
itarian sensibilities.

 

With these considerations in mind,
we may now ask where do we find
other-directedness in W&L? The
obvious beginning is of course in
the fraternities; and since fraterni-
ties are the primary institutions in
the social structure of the student
body, it is immediately apparent
that the W&L social character—the
so-called “typical” W&L man—is
other-directed. This is so because
fraternities are transitory by their
very nature in their effect on fra-
ternity men.

A fraternity is, at most, a four
year affair, and especially since
fraters develop attitudes dependent
on those of other fraters, members
are required to give only temporary
adherence to the fraternity’s com-
mon values. It seems to me, more-
over, that these common values of-
ten change within the span of an
individual’s college career.

Now, About Sex...

Another manifestation of other-
directedness occurs in the realm of
sex, As in modern society as a
whole, it seems to me that the other-
directed W&L man desires to talk—
or is pressured into talking—about
his “sexual achievements,” not as
a means of bragging and gaining re-

“Protest” Editor Lowry Defends Disarmament Stand

To the Editor:

Tracy Harrington’s article in last
Friday’s Ring-tum Phi reflects an
attitude quite common in America
today; I refer to his opinion that
thermonuclear war is inevitable, that
“the only way man can ever be
made to do away with nuclear war
is to have one.”

Mr. Harrington’s position, that of
putting his hands over his head and
waiting for the bomb to fall, reflects,
to my way of thinking, the great
feeling of frustration which results
from not being able to do anything
about the present situation.

I am quoted as having said,
“Something must be done.” This is
a fair statement. I am not willing
to accept the position that thermo-
nuclear war has to be inevitable.
(For, if war is inevitable, we’re
going to be destroyed anyway; why
not unilaterally disarm, as we cer-
tainly have nothing to lose. There
is as much chance of surviving a
Soviet take-over, assuming that this
would also be inevitable, as of sur-
viving a thermonuclear war. What
good is freedom, if no one is left to
enjoy it?) I resent, therefore, being
forced to make the choice implied in
the stupid slogan, “Better Red than
Dead,” or for that matter, “Better
Dead than Red.”

I do reject such concepts as
“limited warfare,” the so-called
“balance of terror,” and “massive
retaliation,” as I reject any nuclear
policy based on deterrence. This is
not because “the human race isn’t
intelligent enough to refrain from
using weapons,” but because the
more we pile up armaments, the
more we become reconciled to the
inevitability of thermonuclear war,
and the less human factors have any
control over the situation.

I am not, as Mr. Harrington states,
an advocate of unilateral disarma-
ment. I do, however, feel that there
are certain unilaterial steps we can
take, in the interest of futhering
peace, even though they might hurt
our national pride. An example of
this would have been refraining
from announcing and preparing for
nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in
the interests of the forthcoming
Geneva talks, not to mention the
unknown deaths and mutations
caused by the addition such tests
would bring to atmospheric radia-
tion. Surely this would have been a
small concession, since the inevi-
tability of thermonuclear war may
well depend on it. A further ex-
ample might be our rejection of the
concept that everything the So-
viets do must be seen as an aspect
of the cold war struggle, instead of
deciding each issue on its respective
merits and its relation to the real
needs of mankind.

Essentially, of course, the way out
of our dilemma is not a military,
political or economic one, but a mor-
al decision. We are faced with a
moral problem; therefore a moral
solution is required. It is time for
us to begin to practice those values
to which we supposedly adhere.

W. B. LOWRY, JR.

 

tragedy, too, was that of the hard
hand of fate. But there was an ele-
ment of pathos in Roderigo due to
the fact that he was weak and al-
lowed himself to be led into a situa-
uation which a realistic man would
have viewed as hopeless. This dual-
ity was deftly exhibited in the char-
acter, and thus the role which often
seems to be a simple one at first
glance was subtly rendered.

Emilia, as depicted by Josephine
Unger, is another role that is dif-
ficult because of its duality. On one
side, she is close to Desdemona and
noble in her sentiments; on the oth-
er, she suggests Bianca, a jealous
and emotional courtesan. This some-
what split personality was a chal-
lenge to Miss Unger, but she met her
task admirably. As a woman of
worldly wit, with the looseness of
character that would become her
as the wife of an ambitious man,
Emilia was charming and refresh-
ing. As the woman of kind and noble
sentiments, she triumphed in her
vindication of Desdemona.

Fine Characterizations

There are three other characteri-
zations to which I should like to call
attention. The first is Brabantio, the
aged and broken father of Desde-
mona, whose wrath and bitterness
were fully and movingly depicted
by Jim Applebaum. Another memo-
rable role was that of Lodovico,
played by Andy Leonard. His ap-
pearance in the final scenes as the
noble statesman, whom fate charged
with the role of mediator after
the catastrophe of the play, was su-
perlative.

The third characterization I wish
to comment on is that of Bianca;
Jeanne Tracy is to be praised for
two reasons: one is that she took
over in this role only last week; the
second is that she brought the most
successful and delightful scenes of
comic relief into the play. The part
is extremely short; Miss Tracy’s
treatment of it is unforgettable.

The minor speaking and non-
speaking roles were more than ade-
quately filled. These people pos-
sessed a naturalness for the most
part, that is sometimes hard to feel
when the character supports, more
than he participates in, the main
stream of the tragedy. This ap-
plies especially to Andy Adelson, as
the aged Duke of Venice; Terry
Van Brunt, as the youthful govern-
or of Cyprus, Montano; and to Gay
Reading, as the brother of Braban-
tio, Gratiano, an old man who was
characterized by deliberation if not
affectation in his role.

Admirably supporting the rest of
the cast were Jack Crissman, Peter
Stelling, and Bill McKin as the sen-
ators, Tim O’Keefe as the Messen-
ger, and Jerry Gray, Gregory Mc-
Nab, and Charles Bright as the gen-
tlemen, Lance Tarrance, Franco de
Battaglia, Tilghman Broaddus, Dan
Friedman, Alan Lanham, and Phil
Oliver as the officers, servants and
attendants.

As the first impact of this per-
formance settles in my mind, I think
back to a passage in John Mase-
field’s William Shakespeare. In talk-
ing about the people of the Shakes-
pearean plays, he said that they
“are alive and hearty. They lead a
vigorous life and go to bed tired.
They never forget that they are
animals. They never let anyone else
forget that they are also divine.” It
migh seem egotistical, but it is sure-
ly the tribute deserved by all of
those who worked to give us this
production of Othello.

Jaycee Spring Sports Show

Will Feature

Bob Davies

Bob Davies, a member of the basketball Hall of Fame and
of the six greatest basketball players of all time, according
to a recent poll of coaches sponsored by Sport Magazine, will
be among a galaxy of stars who will participate in the Valley
Youth Fitness and Sport Show April 13-14, according to
Capt. Frank Walter, chairman of the Jaycee sponsored project.

Davies will be in Lexington to*¥

conduct a basketball clinic on Sat-
urday morning, April 14. The clinic,
open to participation by high school
players and coaches in the District 5
and Valley District area, will be held
in the VMI Fieldhouse from 9:30
a.m. to noon.

An All-American at Seton Hall,
Davies was a star of the Rochester
Royals of the National Basketball
Association and is generally recog-
nized as the greatest of basketball’s
“little men.”

Named to the NBA all-star team
several times, the basketball expert
scored more than 1,000 points dur-
ing three different seasons and cap-
tained Rochester in four campaigns.
As head coach of Seton Hall basket-
ball (1946-47), his team compiled a
24-3 record.

 

Placement

The following companies will have
representatives on campus during
the week of March 19 to 23 to inter-
view seniors who may be interested
in careers with their organizations.
Tuesday, March 20—The Upjohn

Company

Mr. Lynn H. Ledden will visit
our campus in the afternoon only to
interview men who may be inter-
ested in a career with a future in
Pharmaceutical Sales.

 

The purpose of the clinic is to
promote interest in basketball and
to simplify teaching methods so that
younger players, as well as seasoned
veterans, can derive the most from
the game, Capt. Walter said. Davies
will demonstrate and explain basket-
ball shooting in detail, as well as
passing, dribbling, pivoting, offense
and defense.

The Valley Youth Fitness and
Sport Show is an annual project of
the Lexington-Rockbridge Junior
Chamber of Commerce. The first
such event last year garnered the
top award as the outstanding sport
show in Virginia and as one of the
top three such events held nation-
ly.

Over five-thousand people were
attracted to the multi-event pro-
gram last year and the Jaycees are
expecting an even larger tournout
this year.

Davies will be but one of a num-
ber of prominent sports personalities
who will be on hand for the two-
day spectacular.

Here On Wed.

Washington and Lee University | |

will play host to an All-Australian
lacrosse team for four days next
week.

The 27-man team—on an 11-game] | oe

tour of the United States—will be
on the W&L campus
through Thursday. W&L’s Generals
will clash with the Aussies in a
match at 4 p.m. Wednesday on Wil-
son Field.

The Australians’ first game was
scheduled at Duke Thursday, and
the second contest will be Satur-
day in Charlottesville against the
University of Virginia. The Victoria
squad is the first Australian lacrosse
team to play in the United States.

A round of activities has been
planned for the “team from down
under.” Washington and Lee’s 18
social fraternities will entertain
team members at evening meals
Monday and Tuesday in the frater-
nity houses. A post-game banquet,
set for 7 p.m. Wednesday, will be
for both W&L and the Australian
teams. Richard B. Sessoms, sports
information director at Virginia Mil-
itary Institute, will be the principle
speaker for the evening.

On tap also are tours of nearby
Natural Bridge and _ neighboring
VMI. Morning practice sessions are
scheduled Tuesday and Wednesday.

The Aussies will travel from Lex-
ington to College Park for their
fourth match with the University of
Maryland on March 24.

Tickets for the match may be ob-
tained at McCrum’s Drug Store, the
Southern Inn, Pres Brown’s or by
calling the W&L Director of Inter-
collegiate Athletics at HObart 3-

W&L information director Frank
Parsons has some interesting statis-
tics on the Australian lacrosse team
that meets the Generals on March
21.

The average age of the team is 26
years. The oldest player is 39; the
youngest is 18.

Occupations of the players range
from land surveyor to stock ex-
change operator to a motor mer-
chant to a wholesale jeweller.

Here’s a typical rundown on one
of the Aussie All-Stars:

Keith Atkins, goal-keeper. He’s 29,
stands 5’9” and weighs 203 pounds.
He was named the “Best and Fair-
est” in Australia in 1957.

That’s just a sampling of the com-
petition the Generals will be meet-
ing.

ELECTED TENNIS CAPTAIN for
1962 is sophomore John Baker, who
lettered last year as a freshman for
the Generals. Tennis coach Bill
Washburn began practice March 24.

Globetrotters
Here Tonight
At VMI Gym

“Relax, man, relax!”

That’s the war cry of Meadow-
lark Lemon, six foot, three inch hu-
man jumping jack of the Harlem
Globetrotters, who oppose the Wash-
ington Generals in the professional
basketball feature of a triple-bar-
reled jamboree at the VMI Field-
house tonight.

A musical variety show directed
by and starring Cab Calloway and
a table tennis match will round out
the program starting at 7:30.

Lemon, a funloving fellow who
consistently outjumps and outdoes
men many inches taller and pounds
heavier, credits his ability to keep
relaxed, or “loose,” with whatever
success he has enjoyed as the Trot-
ter’s Clown Prince and hot shot
scorer.

Some of the secret of Meadow-
lark’s success as a rebounder, he
concedes, is due to a fantastic 84-
inch arm-spread. His comedy capers
are uniquely his own, and many of
them are ad libbed as the game pro-
gresses.

A lightning fast table tennis match
between English Champion Richard
Bergmann and Africa’s 23-year old
contender for the world’s cham-
pionship, Emmanual Quaye, will be
a feature of the evening according
to Abe Saperstein, who brings the
Globetrotters to Lexington.

Springfield

Next week, Springfield College’s
baseball team moves into Lexington
for a seven-day practice session,
during which time they’ll scrimmage
against the Generals and VMI.

Springfield, one of the nation’s
top baseball powers, has been in
the College World Series for the past
two years.

The reason for their migration to
Lexington is that bad weather in
Massachusetts prevents them from
getting in pre-Spring vacation prac-
tice.

Baseball Team Practicing
Outside; Prospects Good

Washington and Lee’s varsity baseballers moved outside
this week for extensive drills on defensive strategy, and coach
i] Joe Lyles was pleased with the results.

“We've just had five days outside this year,” he said. “But
that’s better than the last two years. We’re looking pretty good

 

With the annual spring vacation®

including wins over West Virginia
and Dartmouth.

Lyles admits that defensively he
couldn’t ask for much more.

Strong Defensively

“We're going to be plenty strong
in the field, and our hitters are
good enough,” he said. “Everything
depends on the pitching.”

Pitching is without a doubt the
biggest question facing Lyles this
year. Gone is Roy Carpenter, the
mainstay of the W&L staff for the
three years, who got five of the
eight General wins last year.

Lyles, however, has seven pitchers
on hand this spring, and hopes that
together they can make up for the
gap left by Carpenter’s departure.

Sophomore Brice Gamber, law
student Phil Sharpe, and senior
Rosie Page will draw the biggest
share of pitching assignments, with
help from Louie Paterno and Jim
Gwinn.

Gamber, an all-state selection in
his high school, came around well
at the end of last year, putting in
at least two excellent pitching per-
formances for the Generals.

Sharpe is a three-year veteran
with considerable experience, as is
Page, who'll probably be Lyles’
number one reliever.

Paterno, who won acclaim in West
Virginia in baseball as well as
basketball, is one of the best pros-
pects in years, according to Lyles,
and will be used extensively not
only as a pitcher but also in the
defensive lineup.

Incomes in the South Said To Be On the Rise

(Continued from page 2)

where money is being spent.

This process typifies the circular
reality that one of the greatest
stimulants to industrial expansion is
a little industrial expansion. This is
the justification of the subsidies and
concessions that so many southern
communities are willing to make to
get “that first industry.” Also, con-
sciousness of market growth as the
foundation for much industrializa-
tion re-enforces awareness that a
new market creates new firms or a
new capacity that requires a loca-
tion decision.

The Low Wage Argument

The most frequently heard reason
for plants expanding southward is
“low non-union wages.” Historical-
ly, labor has proved much more mo-
bile than industry and the cream of
southern labor has flowed north and
west seeking higher wages. Union
restrictions have slowed this pro-
cess down considerably, but has this
union activity been the deciding fac-
tor in southern industrialization?
While the classic example of the
textile industries that were drawn
South by a combination of wages,

raw materials, climate, and markets
is often cited, low wages present a
real dilemma to the southern busi-
ness man seeking industrial pro-
gress.

Industrialization is desirable for
two possible reasons. First, money
stops leaving the region to pay for
goods produced outside which have
been causing an intra-mural drain
on the region’s wealth, making it a
depressed area. Secondly, it is hoped
that products from local industry
will be sold outside the region,
bringing in outside money to be
spent locally, and stimulate the local
economy through consumption or
investment.

Low wages may draw industry
seeking to sell outside the region,
but low wages do not provide the
maximum stimulus or incentive to
industry to develop to supply the
local market. High wages provide a
stronger stimulus for local market-
oriented economic activity, but less
advantage for industry selling out-
side the region. The ideal attitude
for the southern industrialist selling
on the southern market is to want
everybody else’s wages to go up
faster than his own, thus giving him
an expanding market with a cost
lag.

Per Capita Income Increases

Per capita income in the south-
eastern states has risen from about
50 per cent of the national average
in 1930 to almost 75 per cent in 1961.
World War II brought much of this.
Also, during the last decade the
population growth of the South has
exceeded the national rate and there
has been a change in the trend from
emigration to immigration.

While the wage differential still
exists between the South and north-
ern areas, it is partially illusionary.

Comparisons within the same indus-
try show wage differentials, but with
automation and growing markets,
Houston may be chosen as the loca-
tion for a metal-working plant al-
though Boston, Baltimore, and Min-
neapolis have one to three per cent
lower wage levels in that industry,
and Philadelphia and New York
City only two per cent higher.

The growing market and the rap-
idly growing urban and industrial
facilities seem to have demonstrated
their ability to support southern
economic growth, and _ displaced
southern farm labor is now migrat-
ing to southern cities instead of
northern ones. Once the markets and
facilities start growing, local capital
as well as outside capital is fed
into local investments, and the ur-
banization and industrialization pro-
cess becomes self-sustaining.
Mental Factors Hinder Development
The gross statistics of the past
decade seem to indicate that the
South’s economy is coming of age
and that tremendous potential is be-
ing balanced by an accumulation of
retarding forces. In the words of the
director of a recently announced re-
search project for the Twentieth
Century Fund on southern develop-
ment, “In addition to these handi-
caps (referring to the low wage
nature of much southern industry),
the South pays a heavy price for an
inherited set of psychological at-
titudes and cultural values which
impose serious handicaps to the full
and efficient use of much of its man-
power.”

McCormick Library Sees
Growth in All Directions:
Circulation, Size & Budget

Figures released yesterday by Li-
brarian Henry Coleman reveal
marked increase in the circulation,
budget, and size of the library.

The number of reference inquiries
has jumped from 69 to 102 a year
Circulation has risen from 22,061 to
29,126. Correspondingly, the size of
the library has grown from 172,217
to 181,633 books.

Book and magazine purchases
have risen from 1,958 books and 448
magazine subscriptions in 1957, to
2526 books and 510 magazines in
1961. They have also increased this
year.

Books purchased in the US are
bought from Camel and Hall, the
biggest book supply company in the
world. Foreign publications are pur-
chased in London, Paris, Berlin,
Madrid, and Florence.

$21,000 For 1962

The allocated budget of the Li-
brary to meet book and periodical
purchases has been enlarged from
$16,000 for the last four school
years to $18,000 in 1961, and $21,000
in 1962. Understandably, all related
figures have proportionately in-
creased.

Increased Use And Size

This increased use and size of the
library is far greater than that
which would be expected from the
slight increase in enrollment. Uni-
versity Librarian Coleman explains
this paradox by reasoning on the su-
periority of the students now at
W&L. “Students want to do read-
ing and research on their own now.
In the past,” he said, “students only
used the required books and those
on the various reading lists.”

spect, but as a means of accommo-
dating the curiosity of his fellows
and thereby gaining acceptance. It
is my experience that this is com-
mon practice for most Washington
and Lee men (a species to which, I
hasten to add, I at no times deny be-
longing). Also characteristic of oth-
er-directedness is the wide-spread
practice of “dumping on” girls. Since
the typical W&L depends in this in-
stance on the approval of his peers,
and not any innate sense of gentle-
manly abstraction, he can “dump”
because his peers do often approve.

Other-directedness promotes co-
operation as opposed to competition;
and this can be seen illustrated by
the phenomenon of “poor mouth-
ing,’ whereby a student who re-
ceives a higher grade than his fel-
lows will lie—perhaps “distort”
would be a better word in view of
certain circumstances—and down-
grade his mark to the average. Be-
ing “one of the guys” cannot be
denied as an important goal among

W&L men (as where isn’t it?) and
this may perhaps account for the
continued attraction of the “gentle-
man C.”

Other-directed American society
is also noted for the seriousness with
which it approaches its recreational
activity. There are those who will
dispute the contention that combo
parties are essentially serious affairs,
but why should we refuse to accept
the implication that it actually is
hard work for them to reach the
goal of intoxication when students
refer to themselves as “serious
drinkers”?

Finally, the nature of the typical
W&L man’s response to politics
parallels almost exactly that of the
typical other-directed American at
large. The W&L voter is knowledge-
able but indifferent, believing that
he can do nothing to affect or alter
the political situation. He is con-
cerned far more with personalities
than with constitutions and institu-
tional functionings, and especially
with the sincerity of candidates
rather than their ability. Perhaps
this is one reason for the lack-luster
response given to the proposed
Student Senate, which would add
more men to the top echelon of stu-
dent government and thereby in-
crease or create impersonality.

In short, I think that it is more
than reasonable to conclude, for
better or for worse, that the W&L
student body is an other-directed
society.

Christian Top Choice In Presidential Poll

By JACK DeJARNETTE
Tuesday Writer

“Who do you think will be the
likely candidates for the next presi-
dent of the student body?”

“Why do you think that your
choice is a likely candidate?”

In a poll conducted yesterday by
members of the staff of the Tues-
day Ring-tum Phi, 19 of the 31 stu-
dents polled had a definite idea or
preference. Many had no idea that
elections were coming up next
month.

Of the 12 students who had no
idea or preference about the voting,
9 said that they simply did not know
who would be a likely candidate,
and the other three said that they
did not care because it “...makes no
difference.”

Of the possible candidates men-
tioned, Meade Christian, Phi Gam
junior, received 8 votes, or 25 per
cent of those cast.

Next was Tim Ireland, Interme-
diate Law School student, who re-
ceived 7 votes, or 22 per cent of
those cast.

Several people mentioned the pos- |

Independent students not in a fra-

Twelve of the students polled who
had no opinion in the poll represent
38 per cent, a greater percentage
than any of the candidates received.

Interviews were conducted in the
Co-Op, the Library, on the street,
and by telephone.

There were the usual “party lin-
ers” and “fraternity brother of
mine” answers, but more than one
person crossed party line.

Arnold Masinter, Phi Ep senior,
said that he predicted Tim Ireland
would get the vote because “He will
get party backing. He is the top
man in the Law School. We have al-
ready established a precedence in
electing from the Law School. The

who were polled:

John Refo, Sigma Chi junior, said
that “It could be Christian, Ireland,
Montgomery, or Butler. It’s pretty
much up for grabs in both parties.”

Ron Allenstein, ZBT senior, said
of Christian, “I think that his quali-
fications are outstanding as far as
grades and extra-curricular activ-
ities are concerned. I think only a
boy of his ability could maintain
high grades while participating in
the activities that he does.”

Tom Budd, Phi Gam, law student,
simply said, “Christian—he’s the
most qualified.”

Phil Sharp, SAE law school fresh-
man, said, “Tim Ireland. I think
that anybody who knows Tim and
knows what he has done in his
six years at W&L can see that his
qualifications would make him the
likely choice. I think that he could
win.”

Delt Junior, Tom Andrew, said
he thought that either Christian or
McCord would win. He added fur-
ther that he thought the Indepen-
dent Party man would win the elec-

 

tion because, “There isn’t anyone
around for the University Party.”

George Summers, Independent
sophomore, said Christian would win
because, “He’s a good guy and he is
a member of the EC. He can win on
the other side as he proved last
year in the election.”

Terry Fohs, Delt junior, said, “Bob
Payne will win because he has the
qualifications.”

Jud Babcock, SAE junior, predict- | §

ed that Lanny Butler would win be-
cause, “He’s serious and level-head-
ed and that is important. His per-
sonality commands leadership. His
ideas are good. Because he is an
undergraduate he is in closer contact
with the student body as a whole.
He understands the problems of the
student body.”

Walt McManus, Phi Psi sopho-
more, speaking of Dave Montgomery
said, “You can’t beat his all-around
qualifications. He excels everywhere
in student life.”

Phi Delt junior Dave Swann said,
“Tim Ireland is the man for the
job. He is head dorm counselor. He

Executive Committee Passes Dance Set Plan

 

Friday Parties
To Be Closed
On Dance Sets

By ANDY NEA
Managing Editor

The IFC last night passed a
resolution limiting the combos
of fraternities on Friday nights
of dance set weekends. The
proposal will become a part of
the IFC constitution.

The proposal was submitted to
the IFC by Ross Kyger and Tony
Schlesinger, juniors. The new rules
are designed to eliminate a large
amount of conflict that exists be-
teween fraternity combos and Uni-
versity sponsored dance functions.

The proposal as passed by the
IFC stated:

1) All fraternity combo parties
held in conflict with University
sponsored dances on Friday nights
of University dance weekends will
be closed. Closed is to be defined
as members of one fraternity only
and the party shall be held in the
house of that fraternity.

2) No fraternity may compel one
of its members to pay an extra
social assessment for said combo
to be held in conflict with a Uni-
versity sponsored dance if that
member wishes to attend the
dance instead of the combo party.

3) Enforcement of the above
shall be administered directly by
the IFC judiciary committee. All
violations shall be dealt with in
as severe manner as possible.

The proposal was passed by a 15

to 0 vote.
IFC Action

This action on the part of the IFC
is designed to eliminate as much as
possible conflict with University
sponsored dance functions. This mo-
tion was designed to discourage fra-
ternity parties during the time of
University dance functions but still
allow fraternity parties for those
who desire them.

The motion will be voted upon |
next week and its approval will |

make it a permanent part of the IFC
Constitution.

This plan will not go into effect |
until next year. Direct results of the |
proposal will not be realized until |
the plan has had a chance to be put
into practice over a period of time.

It was pointed out that fraternity
parties would be able to be opened

following the end of University
dances

Barlier this month the IFC turned
down a proposal that would have
entirely banned fraternity combos
during University dance functions.
It wan felt that this proposal would

Executive Committee Meetings

To Be Opened To Press

By KEN

Associate Editor

A constitutional amendment to replace dance set presi-
dents with class presidents was passed by the EC in last night’s

meeting.

The office of President of Fancy Dress, however, will con-
tinue to be elected by the Student Body in the Spring elections.

The Committee also voted

to open its meetings to press

representation, though reserving the right to privacy at its own

discretion.
A proposal made by Sigma Delta*®
Chi, the professional journalism

society, to have the motion submit-
ted as an amendment to the con-
stitution was unanimously voted
down, however.

The plan for revision of the dance
set presidents was presented by
Senior Executive Committeeman,
Steve Galef, President of the Dance
Board.

Under this plan, the President
of the Sophomore class along with
the other officers and any vice
presidents that he might need

shall conduct Openings Dance
Set. The Junior President and his
group. shall conduct Springs

dent and his group shall conduct

The office of President of Fancy

The amendment was accepted by
a vote of 8 for and 4 against, thus
just barely gaining the required
two-thirds majority.

Voting for the amendment were
Christian, Roberts, Ogilvie, Boiar-

Suttle.

The EC measure to have press
representation was _ introduced
earlier this year through a request
made by Ring-tum Phi Editor,
Roy Goodwin.

The motion will go into effect as
of next Monday night’s meeting.

The EC on the other hand vot-
ed down the Sigma Delta Chi pe-
tition to make press representation
an official part of the student body

(The proposal was not presented
in the form of an amendment, but
as a statement of the organiza-
tion’s stand against the EC’s se-
crecy. However, since the consti-
tution specifically designates those
permitted to attend EC meetings,
the petition had to be considered
a proposed amendment.—Ed.)

The petition read as follows:

Sigma Delta Chi, professional
journalistic society, strongly urges
that hereafter you open all legis-
lative meetings of the Committee
to the general public and to the
press.

We believe that if student
government is to be truly re-
sponsible to those whom it repre-
sents, its meetings should be open
to its constituents.

a

We believe that if a government
is to be truly democratic, its pro-
ceedings should be discussed as
widely as possible.

Opening meetings in this way
would not rule out the possibili-
ty of the Committee’s going into
executive session when necessary.

We do not attack the integrity
of the Executive Committee at
Washington and Lee, but we feel
it is our position as responsible
journalists to combat secrecy at all
levels of government.

We therefore request that these
meetings be open to the public
and the press.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Soviets Use Mass Media For Own Purposes

By MR. O. W. RIEGEL
Professor of Journalism

The basic function of the press,
broadcasting, and other media in the
Soviet Union—to advance the poli-
cies and goals of the Communist
state as those policies and goals are
determined by the political leader-
ship—is well enough known to re-
quire no elaboration here.

It may be of interest, however, to
point out some of the reasons for
the development of the Soviet sys-
tem, briefly describe the present
state of communications in the So-
viet Union and comment on recent
changes which are already modify-
ing Soviet life and which may bring

Soviet Union and in the relationship

There is nothing novel or pe-

to harness media of communica-

political leadership by affirmative
propaganda or negative censor-
ship. All authoritarian govern-
ments make the effort. An ambas-

Another Look
At Recent Proposals

The proposals that have been made concerning the dance
set presidents and the IFC president seem to be diametrically
opposed to each other. On the one hand the dance set propos-
als will remove some of the politics from the “Big Seven” and
class elections, while on the other hand, the IFC president pro-
posals will only replace it with more.

We concur with the Friday Edition in the opinion that the
replacement of the dance set president with a class president

has ‘‘considerable merit.”

Under this plan the class presidents

would become more than mere political officers with only
nominal duties and could possibly receive more student co-op-
eration. Perhaps Openings and Springs could even become
unofficial class weekends, as Finals is destined to become.
In any case we heartily agree with the proposal and the Exec-
utive Committee’s decision to accept it.

As we stated in last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi, the
move to elect the IFC president is basically a sound
idea. There are considerations, however, which must be
taken into account to give an over-all picture. We must
also remember that there are two sides to any question
thus we feel we should give the other viewpoint held by

some students.

To make the Interfraternity Council president a Spring
election office is both unrealistic and unnecessary. It is un-
realistic to believe that to take the election out of the IFC and
put it before the entire campus will involve less politics. If
anything, it will bring more politics into play. One provision of
the proposal is that any upperclassman can run for the office,
whether he has had previous experience in the IFC or not.

It seems essential to have some knowledge of the opera-
tion of the IFC before becoming president of it, just as the
presidency of any organization requires some familiarity with

it.

It is also obvious that any time an elective office is
placed before a large group, more pressure is exerted
from all sides and more factors come into play than the
candidates’ qualifications alone.

An even greater consideration is the nature of the IFC
itself. The Interfraternity Council is a representative organi-
zation without direct student membership.

Just as the United States Congress is a representative body
and, as such, elects its own head in the person of the Speaker,
so the IFC represents the fraternities as a whole, and the indi-
vidual representatives are in the best position to elect their

(Continued on page 4)

 

Ww

sador from Spain, now deceased,
made a speech in Lexington a few
weeks ago in which he said that
it is the duty of government to
control freedom of speech and
press when such freedom would
lead to subversion, a statement to
which the Soviet government
could also subscribe.

The wish to control communica-
tions for special purposes is, in fact,
a universal phenomenon. It is the
editing principle of most political,
religious, educational, and business
organisms, and is justified by such
socially accepted words and phrases
as “education,” “responsibility,”
“national security,” or “liberty but
not license.”

The West has been protected
against some of the more extreme
of the stultifying effects of this ed-
iting principle by pluralism (diver-
sified groups contradicting and com-
batting each other) and by a body of
information professionals who in
in theory, if not always in practice,
dispassionately report the facts and
do not compromise this goal by
serving whatever political, economic,
or social interests happen to have
power at the time.

Neither of these safeguards oper-
ate effectively in the Soviet Union,
where what is quaintly known as
“the free market-place of ideas” ex-
ist only in those areas which offer no
challenge to the basic system of gov-
ernment or to the security of the
state.

The makers of the Revolution
were well aware that their suc-
cess depended ultimately upon
their ability to win the consent, or
at least to prevent the active op-
position, of a mass population in
which existed a great deal of ig-
norance and lethargy. For this
reason, the leaders of the Revolu-
tion placed an exceptionally high
value on mass media as a partner,
along with personal influence, po-
lice power and other controls, in
the building of the new state.

Although it might be argued that
personal contact, through the vast
network of workers in the Agitation
and Propaganda Department of the
Communist Party, has carried the
main load of “political education,”
there is ample evidence of the very
special regard of Soviet leadership
for mass media, based upon their
effectiveness and relative cheapness
as instruments of control.

The rapid elimination of illiteracy
(the Soviet Union has now one of
the highest literacy rates in the
world) is evidence of the priority
concern of leadership for preparing
a mass population capable of being
a consumer of mass media. Lenin,
inspired Pravda (“truth”) in 1912,
Stalin was editor of Pravda in 1917,
and “journalists” have always been
represented in the highest echelons
of policy-making, including member-
ship in the Central Committee and
Presidium of the Party and top po-
sitions as formulators of official
doctrine.

Another example of the special
solicitude of the Soviet state for
mass media is the remarkable de-
velopment during the 1920’s of the
motion picture, a medium that Lenin

Ww

recognized at an early date as in-
comparable for reaching a mass pop-
ulation with maximum effect.

Another example is the devel-
opment of a number of special
schools for journalists, both to
prepare students for professional
careers and to provide refresher
courses for practicing journalists.
Another example is the high de-
gree of saturation in communica-
tion achieved in a vast country,
with a population of more than
200,000,000, with what seems, in
terms of this country, a relative-
ly modest investment in the mach-
inery, physical network, and labor
of communications,

This saturation is achieved by a
variety of channels and media rang-
ing from the All-Union radio and
television networks to the ubiqui-
tous wall newspapers posted in fac-
tories and clubs all over the country.

It must be remembered that in the
Soviet Union communications start-
ed from scratch with the Revolution,
and that the number, location, and
role of newspapers, broadcasting
stations, magazines, and_ theaters
have all been carefully planned to
arrive at a maximum of availability
and penetration with a minimum
of expense, duplication, and waste.
This is difficult to comprehend in a
country like the United States, in
which these media appear willy nil-
ly, fight each other in bitter com-
petition, duplicate each other, and
frequently give up the ghost, with
attendant waste and displacement
of labor, as is happening now not-
ably in the case of magazines and
motion picture theaters.

The contrast is dramatic between
the advantages of freedom of en-
terprise and the disadvantages of
waste, as in the case of the United
States, and the advantages of ra-
tionalized planning and the disad-
vantages of monolithic control, as in
the case of the Soviet Union.

While there is nothing unique
in the Soviet employment of. com-
munications for political purposes,
there is no doubt but that the pe-
culiar paragon of Marxist-Lenin-
ist ideology employed by Soviet
publications gives them a weird,
unearthly sound (“crazy man”)
to most Americans. We are also
repelled by the sameness of Soviet
publications, their generally dead-
ly seriousness, their avoidance of
expression of any basic political
criticism, their lack of ingenuity
in physical appearance, and their
lack of liveliness resulting from
the omission of many kinds of
news sought by many western
readers.

The Soviet journalist has tradi-
tionally argued that when a man
gets drunk and bashes in the head
of his mistress with a monkey
wrench, it is a random accident of
the human condition but not news.
If the same man gets drunk and
throws his monkey wrench into the
main generator of the Dnieperstory
power plant, interrupting and sabo-
taging Soviet production, it is news,
and the culprit will receive appro-

 

priate publicity, including notice of
his fate.

w

Other circumstances account for
the peculiar flavor of the Soviet
press. Born in revolution and de-
veloping during its early years in
an atmosphere of fear of counter-
revolution and invasion, the press
not surprisingly acquired some of
the neurotic habits of a beleaguered
state, including suspicion, fear of
disclosure, and an austerity of ob-
session with defense. These qualities
were only intensified by the author-
itarianism and fear of the Stalin
epoch.

Also, the Soviet press has not been
immune from some of the neurotic
effects of a national inferiority com-
plex, including touchiness and a
strident insistence upon the right-
ness of the Soviet rationale of “free-
dom of the press” and the correct-
ness of Soviet professional practices.

The Soviet press, of course, does
not seem as weird, dull and unin-
formative to the Soviet citizen as
it does to the western observer.
The Soviet reader is used to the
vocabulary; I suspect he is adept
at deciphering the twists and turns
of current events from the materi-
al offered to his eyes and ears.

Moreover, since Stalin’s death in
1953, and especially since the con-
demnation of Stalinism by Khru-
schev at the 20th Party Congress in
1956, there have been portentous
changes in both the theory and
practice of mass media operation in
the Soviet Union. The dissatisfaction
of leadership (and presumably of the
consumer) with the dullness and
doctrinaire character of the mass
media has come much more into the
open. -

Khruschev’s own son-in-law, Al-
eksei I. Adzhubei, editor of Izvestia
(News), national newspaper of the
central government, has been espec-
ially vocal in criticizing the stodgi-
ness of the press and its lack of
imagination and courage, and has
brightened Izvestia in content and
appearance. While his changes seem
hardly revolutionary to western
eyes, they do represent a change of
course. They are apparently well re-
ceived, as the circulation of Izves-

 

 

tia has doubled since he became edi-

Americans Must Rearm Their

Editor, Ring-tum Phi

The sentiments of Mr. Lowry’s
letter published last Friday and,
indeed, the whole recent peace push
by Protest are well-meant but
wholly unreasonable.

Mr. Lowry and his adherents do
us a good service in underlining the
terrible danger of extermination, but
I am sick and tired of hearing how
many square feet of American soil
a 50 megaton bomb could incinerate.
The histerical—from Lord Russell to
Lowry, will paint the tragedy in
ghastly terms, and then add, with
a final flourish, “can you possibly
conceive of what will happen?” I
should answer, “Well, I suppose so
many acres of soil would go up.
When a bomb falls, it usually ex-
plodes.”

In other words, I have accepted
calmly a premonition that the Uni-
ted States will experience nuclear
devastation in a decade or so. How
can I be calm? Well, I know this is
banal patriotism, but I am calm be-
cause I have a basic faith in our
people, a faith remote from ideal-
ism, that is rooted in the fiber and
blood of other Americans, a faith
that we will snap back from de-
struction.

What will be left afterwards—

 

namely, the country—will have been
worth dying for. “‘Ah” say the pa-
cifists. What will be left worth any-
thing? What can a citizen do against
the Bomb? If I recall correctly, a
number of civilians in the last war
did a great deal for themselves with
precious little left to them—wheth-
er they were in Fastung Europa

 

or across the Channel from it. Re-
member the R.A.F.? Remember the
London air wardens, the Maquis, the
common Frenchman or German
who secretly made the V-for-Vic-
tory in his heart whenever Allied
bombs fell?

We had pacifists before the sec-
ond War. They moralized and
mouthed impressively about peace
right up until 2403 servicemen died
at Pearl Harbor. Shortly afterwards,
Roosevelt did not advise Congress
that “thou shall not kill,” rather he
curtly mentioned that “Yesterday,
December 7, 1941, a date which will
live in infamy, the United States of
America was suddenly and delib-
erately attacked.” It can, and I fear,
will happen again soon. Perhaps this

 

time around the pacifists can be
silenced and so ease the shock of
“surprise.”

How can one think of peace when
one knows that a sizeable portion
of humanity would like, at least in
theory, to wipe the US. off the
map? They may well try. One morn-
ing, or one evening, Bombs will

fall and cities will vanish, and
Americans will have to take it. Our
mettle will be severely tested. But
in the name of God, or anything
else you hold sacred, do not hold
that we will be automatically de-
feated or destroyed. To so think or
speak is treason.

The world will exist after the
blasts cease. The injury will be
close, deep, and personal. The risk
involved for each American citi-
zen will be approximately that of
a combat soldier on patrol. If one
can keep one’s wits sharpened, and
use common sense mixed with the
usual ever-present cock-sure bra-
vado, then chances for survival will
be good. The survivors will not ov-
erly grieve that one out of every

Indomitable Spirit

four Americans died in the attack,
they will concentrate on the three
who lived. It would be an unusual
world, and one not entirely unpleas-
ant. New cities would be built, free
from tradition, constructed for wis-
er, stronger, perhaps sadder, (and
fewer) people.

Science would be hard-pressed to
restore a high national standard of
living, and would probably succeed
in a decade or so. Certain prob-
lems—birth control and population
explosion, for instance—would no
longer exist (though they could re-
cur); and there would be a strong,
healthy impetus to make a newer
and a better world. “We lived
through that,” a philosopher of the
post-Atomic Renaissance might say,
“We have stood our test of fire and
ash and have endured at great hard-
ship. We are here, though, and
amazed at the new world that is
going up around us.”

There are people, I suppose, who
fiendishly hope that the sky will
fall. They suffer a martyr complex
that has its roots in selfishness. The
more rational among us must stop
acting like spolied children who nib-
ble a golden tradition like so much
pablum. World Peace is impossible,
a contradiction in terms so long

 

as we believe in co-operative com-
petition (capitalist, of course) and
they condone a mass conquest, moral
and physical, resulting in oblitera-
tion of what we believe in. Peace?
Don’t be absurd.

We have been taught to fear not
God but the Reds. Worst of all, the
pacifists are bringing us around to
believe that we must all die... and
die as cowards. Words no longer
suffice, and soon all Summits will be

WEL Looks At Communism

Eighth In A Series

This is the eighth in a series of nine
articles by members of the Washington
and Lee faculty dealing with commun-
ism and its various aspects.

Professor O. W. Riegel’s article,
Mass Media in the Soviet Union, dis-
cusses the basic function of the press,
broadcasting, and other media in the
Soviet Union; analyzes the present state
of communications, and comments on
how recent communication changes are
already modifying Soviet Life.

Next Week: Dr.

 

a ii represents, in a sense,
the new, post Stalin Soviet man,
journalistic variety, with an interest
in innovation and a freer intellect-
ual climate. Also as we could ob-
serve on his visits to this country,
he has a more hearty, western-type
openness and give-and-take in his
personal behavior than the old style
journalist.

The change in climate shows it-
self in a variety of ways. One is
the abolition of direct censorship
of foreign press correspondents,
an event that occurred last
spring, although correspondents
may still be lectured and even ex-
pelled for actions by their news-
papers considered objectionable by
the Soviet Union.

Another is an increased interest
in a wider variety of programming
in Soviet television. Another is the
willingness of the Soviet Union to
exchange propaganda in the mass
media, as occurred recently when
Adzhubei’s interview with President

‘Kennedy was published in Izvestia,

and which may occur shortly in
television with an exchange of pro-
grams by heads of state.

Another sign of change is what
appears to be a current campaign to
make increased use of the so-called
“rabselkor,” a made-up word mean-

Leon F. Sensa-

 

ing worker-peasant correspondent.
The USSR claims to have more than
a million of the rabselkor, who are
supposed to send regular corres-
pondence to newspapers to report
on deficiencies in Soviet life, and,
incidentally, give the government a
kind of continuous Gallup poll of
public satisfaction and dissatisfac-
tion.

There is also evidence that pro-
fessional Soviet journalists look
upon these amateur newspaper
writers with some hostility. Prav-
da reports having received 325,-
640 letters from readers in 1961,
and Izvestia, 211,379.

I recall a visit to the printing
plant of Izvestia in Moscow in 1935
when a special visa was required to
pass each of the fully armed Red
Army soldiers stationed at the door
of each of the inside rooms of the
building, and when the excellent
German presses were operated by
peasant women in peasant costume
whose technical incompetence was
acknowledged. Improvement in poli-
tical climate and in technical pro-
ficiency since that time has been
great.

The Soviet Union, of course, is
anything but a free society in the
communications field. All of the
tools of publication in any medi-
um, the transmitters and the pres-
ses, belong to the state. Broad-
casting is government operated.
Newspapers and magazines are
published by labor unions and
various kinds of societies as well
as by government and Party, but
their basic political conformity is
assured by the manner in which
their staffs are selected.

One thing is certain, and that is
that no channel of communication in
the USSR is owned by any individ-
ual, How far the new spirit of inno-
vation and criticism can go under
such conditions is a question, but it
would certainly appear to have very
definite limits without a change in
the country’s political structure.

The basic question for evalua-
tion, really, is how well informed,
and how capable of understanding

Washington and Lee swimmers
William Broaddus, Walter McManus
and John Wolfe all placed in the
finals of the Virginia A.A.U. meet at

Fort Lee, Saturday.

William Broaddus, freshman,
managed a fourth and fifth in the
100 and 200 yard _ backstroke
events.

Walter McManus, sophomore,
placed third and sixth in the 200 and
100 yard butterfly, respectively.

The 200 yard event provided the
unfortunate humor of the meet
when the rope used to stop false
starts fell on McManus who was at
that point challenging for second.

The ensuing confusion caused the
race to be stopped. It was swum
over ten minutes later.

John Wolfe, this year’s freshman
standout, placed fifth in both the
200 and 400 yard freestyle events.

However, Wolfe and McManus
were forced to leave early prevent-
ing them competing in the finals of
one of each of their events. Conse-
quently, Wolfe was ranked fifth in
the 200 yard freestyle and McManus
was ranked sixth in the 100 yard

(Continued on page 4)

 

Unfortunately for the Generals’
cause, the weather wasn’t the only
thing that was cold. So were the
pitchers and the hitters, and the
end result was a 15-6 loss.

However, coach Joe Lyles isn’t
worried about the score in these
scrimmage games. He’s out to im-
prove the team before the opener at
Elon March 31, and “the only way
to get better is to play; against com-
petition, not just squad games.
That’s why we’re doing it.”

All the scoring in Saturday’s
scrimmage came in big innings.
The Keydets got ten runs in the
second inning, and five in the fifth.
The Generals’ six came on five
in the third and one in the sixth.

But Lyles found a few encourag-
ing signs in the ball game. He
singled out Brice Gamber and Jim
Gwinn as the best-looking of the
four pitchers he used in the ball
game. It just wasn’t good weather
for pitchers. It was too cold for them
to throw hard, and thus be effective.

Ned Hobbs came in for his share
of the coach’s scant praise, due to
a triple. Jim Russ drew some for his
home run in the Generals’ big third
inning. And third baseman Chuck
Lane looked good on one play, when
he made a diving stop of a smash
to his left and threw the runner
out at first.

Prospects

Lyles played his freshman pros-
pects in the last two innings of the
abbreviated contest. “They made a
lot of mistakes, but that’s why we

Game Set For 4 On Wednesday

 

Aussie All-Stars To Face Generals

Enter Game

With 1-1 Record

By JUD REIS
Assistant Sports Editor

The All-Australian lacrosse
team arrived on campus yes-
terday, having compiled a 1-1
record in American competi-
tion to date.

Thursday the Aussies trounced
Duke’s Blue Devils 14-5, but lost
Saturday, 19-15, to the strongest
UVA team in many years.

Coach Bob McHenry, who scout-
ed the UVA game for W&L, said the
Australian All-Stars were not only
fast, but had excellent stickwork.
Their game centers around forcing
their opponents into crucial errors.
The Aussies, used to playing a game
which allows no substitution, are in
excellent condition.

Griffin Scores

Their high scorer is crease man
Bryan Griffin, number 8. He scored
six against Duke and five against
UVA. W&L Co-Captain Bart Mit-
chell will be defending against Grif-
fin in Wednesday afternoon’s game.
Aussie Captain Don Miller and
Vice-Captain Allan Pierce both
played against W&L in the lacrosse
team’s Australian tour in 1959.

Line-Up

The starting line-up for tomor-
row’s game runs as follows: Attack,
Klingelhofer, Hankey, and either
Snead, Michaeles, or Andrew. Mid-
field, Gummey, Wooten and McDan-
iel. Defense, Co-Captains Mitchell

 

 

A group of the

 

and Wheeler, and either Reed or
Van Rensselaer.

Plagued by goalie problems, Mc-
Henry has finally decided on ex-
creaseman Ray Miller. Miller, after
only a week’s experience, will make
his game debut tomorrow. Accord-
ing to McHenry the senior stickman
has progessed quickly and should
fill the gap in the Generals’ defense.

After meeting W&L the Austral-
ian All-Stars will play some of the
nation’s top teams including Mary-
land, Johns Hopkins, the Baltimore
Lacrosse Club, the Philadelphia La-
crosse Club, Princeton, Rutgers,
Army and Navy.

EDUCATIONAL TV: ITS CAUSE
AND CURE

A great deal of nonsense has been written about educational
television. Following is my contribution:

It has been said that television allots no desirable viewing
hours to educational and intellectual programs. This is simply
not so. For instance, you can see “The Kant and Hegel Hour’
every day at 4 a.m. This excellent show is followed at 5 a.m.
by “Kierkegaard Can Be Fun.” For such lazy seamps as lie
abed beyond that hour, there is a splendid program on Sunday
mornings at 7:15 called “Birds of Minnesota, Except Duluth.”

So much for the myth that TV gives no prime time to educa-
tional programs. Now let us deflate another canard: that TV
is not eager to inject intellectual content in all its programs.

If you have sat, as I have sat, with a television planning
board, you would know that the opposite is true. I was priv-
ileged recently to witness a meeting of two of TV’s topmost
program developers—both named Binkie Tattersall.

“Binkie,” said Binkie to Binkie, “if there is one thing I
am bound and determined, it’s that we’re going to have intel-
lectual content in next season’s programs.”

“Right!” replied Binkie. “So let us put on our thinking
caps and go to work.”

“T forgot my thinking cap in Westport,” said Binkie, “but
I have a better notion: let us light a Marlboro.”

“But of course!” cried Binkie. ‘Because the best way to
think is to settle back and get comfortable, and what is the
cigarette that lets you settle back and get comfortable?”

“T said Marlboro,” answered Binkie. ‘Weren’t you listening?’

“A full-flavored smoke is Marlboro,” declared Binkie.

“Rich tobacco, pure white filter, a choice of pack or box.
What is better than a Marlboro?”

“A Marlboro and a match,” replied Binkie. “Got one?”

Binkie had, and so they lit their good Marlboros and settled
back and got comfortable and proceeded to cerebrate.

“First of all,’ said Binkie, “we are going to avoid all the old
clichés. We will have no domestic comedies, no westerns, no
private eyes, no deep sea divers, no doctors, and no lawyers.”

“Right!” said Binkie. ‘Something offbeat.”

“That’s the word—offbeat,” said Binkie.

They smoked and cerebrated.

“You know,” said Binkie, “there has never been a series
about the Coast and Geodetic Survey.”

“Or about glass blowers,” said Binkie.

They fell into a long, torpid silence.

“You know,” said Binkie, “there’s really nothing wrong with

’

 

 

PP ea? 2

 

A Gabo adeeb ser diver cidh-r bw doer Ysa?

a cliché situation —provided, of course, it’s offbeat.”

“Right!” said Binkie. “So let’s say we do a series about a
guy who’s a family man with a whole bunch of lovable kids
who play merry pranks on him.”

“Yeah, and he’s also a cowboy,” said Binkie.

“And a deep sea diver,” said Binkie.

“With a law degree,” said Binkie.

“Plus an M.D.,” said Binkie.

“And he runs a detective age ney,’ said Binkie.

“Binkie,”

They shook hands silently, not trusting themselves to speak,
and lit Marlboros and settled back to relax, for Marlboro is a
cigarette not only for cerebration, but for settling back with

said Binkie to Binkie, “we’ve done it again!”

Noell Is Best Debater

Bill Noell, W&L sophomore from
Bluefieldfi W. Va., took top honors
as the best debater at the District
VIL Regional Debate Tournament
held Friday and Saturday in Wil-
liamsburg.

Taking first place out of a field
of 60 condidates, Noell sparked the
W&L team to an overall ninth place
out of 30 colleges in the contest.

Al Eckes, another sophomore, tied
for fourth place.

The teams were judged on the
basis of eight rounds of strength
meets strength debate.

District VII is one of the strongest
debate areas in the country.

Teams included in the area are
Princeton, King’s and Georgetown.

Dr. King In Lynchburg

For those who are interested, Dr.
Martin Luther King will speak in
Lynchburg next Tuesday night.

Speaking at the E. C. Glass Au-
ditorium at 8 p.m., the controver-
sial Negro leader will speak on
“Non-Violence.”

Dr. King made headlines at W&L
recently when he was refused the
right to speak here.

Dr. Colvin Speaks Tonight

Dr. Milton Colvin, associate pro-
fessor of political science, will
speak tonight on “German Foreign
Policy.”

Speaking in duPont Auditorium at
7:30 p.m., Dr. Colvin will draw at-
tention to Germany’s role to the
East-West struggle for power.

Physics Professor Here

Dr. Peter van de Kamp will be in
Lexington Wednesday and Thursday
to lecture to physics classes at
VMI and W&L. He will also give a
public lecture on “The Milky Way
System” in VMI’s Mallory Hall at 8
p.m. March 21.

A native of the Netherlands, Dr.
van de Kamp has recently received
degrees from the University of Ut-
recht and the University of Cali-
fornia.

In addition to teaching at Swarth-
more, U. Va., and Harvard, Dr. van
de Kamp has lectured at leading
universities in France, Germany and
Holland.

 

Concert Wednesday Night

A concert given by the Blue Ridge
Chamber Music Players will be held

Hf

Wednesday night at 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel.

Both new and old music will be
performed at the concert, and fea-
tured will be the playing of “Draw-
ings Set No. 3” by Sydney Hodkin-
son, composer and clarinetist of the
group.

Other members of the Players are
Anne McClenny, Elizabeth Despor-
tes, and Roger Taylor.

Admission to the concert is free.
A reception will be held in the Com-
mons after the program.

Captain Hall Transferred

Captain Hugh J. Hall, of W&L’s
ROTC Department, recently re-
ceived orders transferring him to
duty in South Viet Nam.

Although his duty in Viet Nam
has not been precisely stipulated, it
is assumed that he will serve as a
member of the U.S. Military As-
sistance and Advisory Group.

Captain Hall has been the instruc-
tor of the MS III cadets at W&L
for the last three years. Previously
he served with the 7th Cavalry
Regiment in Japan.

Capt. Hall will leave Lexington
about April 28th to report to Fort
Bragg, N.C., for a four-week Spe-
cial Warfare Course.

The course will prepare him for
his Viet Nam duty to follow immed-
iately thereafter.

play, to correct them.” Ashley Al-
len now seems to be a good prospect
as second-string catcher behind the
veteran Russ, and Bob Taylor, a
right fielder, impressed with his left-
handed power hitting. Braxton Tabb
looks good at first base, and Jim
Boardman is a strong candidate at
second.

 

Pitching

The key, though, is going to be the
team’s pitching.

Two of Lyles’ righthanders, Penn
Way and Rosie Page, have quit, and
he’s left with only six pitchers. One
of these, Jim Gwinn, hasn’t thrown
a ball in competition for two years.
Three are freshmen; Louie Paterno,
Mason McGowin, and Chris Wigert.
They look good so far, but haven’t
really been under fire yet.

And there are two veterans, Phil
Sharp and Gamber.

The team will spend this week
scrimmaging against the “A” and
“B” squads of Springfield College.

leveled. Why? As good arguments
for the theory that history repeats
itself, I quote in modern context
what is common’ knowledge—in
1962 the only thing we have to fear
is fear itself, and the world can no
longer endure half free and _ half
slave.

After the shooting, good sense
might come to the descendants of the
survivors, but human nature dic-
tates that World War II will not
be the last war. Incredible as it may
sound, there may still be pacifists.
Fortunately, there will be other
Americans of more perceptive ilk.
We shall need brave men and wo-
men in that time of troubles, but we
have them now, and enough of them
will survive to ridicule those of us
who believe that we could moral-
ize away the harsh facts of the
world, who thought that what we
believe in was not worth fighting
for it nuclear bombs had to be
used; they will especially curse
those of us who dreamed sense-
lessly of a fairy peace when we
should have been rearming—and re-
affirming the indomitable spirit of
the American people.

As shown by last night’s action on the University dance

This is a tricky question and in-
volves broad, impressionistic judg-
ments. It might be well to ask, how-
ever, whether either one is much
better off than the other as far as
protection against stereotyped and
propagandistic reporting about each
other is concerned.

The Russians have propaganda
films; we have little Orphan Annie
and Winnie Winkle, and the gro-
tesque distortions are not limited to
our comic strips. Perhaps the best
that can be said on this point is
that the citizen of the West can, if
he has enough interest and desire,
find objective reporting of reality
if he looks hard enough.

On the other hand, the tension
level in the free West, and especially
in the United States, seems much
higher than in the Soviet Union. In-

or even expressions of unfriendli-
ness toward Americans are report-
ed rarely from the Soviet Union.

Anti-Russian phenomena of these
types in the United States are con-
tinual and may be justified for
many by the world situation, but it
is interesting for the observer to
note that in the Soviet Union either
the raising of the tension level is
not at this time one of the tasks
assigned to the mass media, or the
anti-American material in the Soviet
press is oddly ineffective.

New Faculty
Appointees
Are Named

Men Hired In Sciences,
Greek & Latin, Sociology

Four new men have been appoint-
ed to the Washington and Lee fac-
ulty, Dean of the College William
W. Pusey III announced today.

They are Odell S. McGuire, in-
structor in geology; George S. Whit-
ney, instructor in chemistry; Her-
man W. Taylor, Jr., instructor in
ancient languages; and Emory Kim-
brough Jr., instructor in sociology.

All appointments are effective
September 1, Dean Pusey said.

The new instructors expect to ob-
tain their Ph.D. degrees during 1962.

McGuire, 35, a native of Knoxville,
Tenn., holds a B.S. degree from the
University of Tulsa and a M.A. from
Columbia University. He is now
studying at the University of Illin-
ais on a National Science Founda-
tion Fellowship. From 1957 to 1960,
he worked for the Texaco Explora-
tion Company at Calgary. He is
married and the father of two chil-
dren.

Whitney, 28, a native of Wheat-
land, Wyo., is a B.A. graduate of
the University of Colorado and
studied in Germany on a Fulbright
Fellowship. He is studying at North-
western University. He is married.

Taylor, 28, a native of Washing-
ton, D.C., attended Washington and
Lee from 1953 to 1955 and received
his B.A. degree from the University
of North Carolina. He is studying
at North Carolina where he is an
instructor in Greek and Latin. He
is married and has one child.

Kimbrough, 28, a native of Clarks-
ville, Tenn., received his B.A. from

Lexington’s
Bottle Club
Draws Elite

A number of faculty members are
reputed to have become members in
the Traveller’s Club, a private “so-
cial” club from which students have
been excluded.

An independent “social” group
(Bottle Club?), the Travellers have
of late set up operations in several
rooms of the Robert E. Lee Hotel.

An interview with a W&L figure
rumored to be secretary of the
club revealed no definite functions
of the organization. The club re-
portedly does have a_ president,
board of directors, and other offic-
ers; they seem to prefer anonymity.

Rumored to be slightly anarchist
in attitude, the club may have been
formed to negate the early closing
of the Liquid—that is, to provide
activity after eleven o’clock....

Another speculative reason for the
club’s existence is that some Lex-
ington adults may desire indepen-
dence from the fraternity houses for
a party.

Prompted by an obsession to limit
membership to the select few
deemed worthy of such grave re-
sponsibility, the group admits new
members by invitation only. The elite
of Rockbridge County—barring stu-
dents—has been combed for mem-
bership.

The Travellers are, says a spokes-
man, following the tradition of the
Old White at Greenbriar and the
James River Club at Lynchburg.
Similar clubs exist in most Virginia
cities; Richmond boasts five or six
of these hotbeds of intellectual
stimulation.

The most recent rumor among
many concerning the social (Bottle)
club is that they have been closed
down by the gendarmerie of the
city.

Swisher Slated
To Speak Here

Dr. Carl B. Swisher, a professor
of political science at Johns Hop-
kins University, will speak Tuesday
at Washington and Lee.

He will discuss “The Doldrums of
Belief: Oud Land and Our Tradi-
tion” at 8:15 p.m. in a public lecture
in Washington and Lee’s duPont
Auditorium. His appearance is un-
der the sponsorship of the univer-
sity’s department of political sci-
ence and the University Center in
Virginia.

Dr. Swisher, a former president
of the American Political Science
Association, is Thomas P. Stran
professor of political science at
Johns Hopkins. He has been teach-
ing there since 1937.

 

Yesterday evening, despite bad
weather and rough terrain, units of
the Washington and Lee ROTC
corps of cadets successfully attacked
and overran an aggressor position
located in the hills of the Liberty
Hall area.

This offensive took place as a
part of a series of tactical problems
presented to the members of the
cadet corps to test and improve their
ability to apply classwork matter in
the field. The first part of this series
was the compass problem held last
fall.

Advancing from an assembly area
each platoon individually attacks the
objective occupied by aggressors
forces and is brought under fire by
the enemy as it advances.

Realism is accentuated and the
problem made as lifelike as possible

gressors with blank ammunition to
be fired from rifles and machine
guns as well as grenade launchers
with signal flares.

The purpose of this maneuver is to
familiarize cadets with the problems
of command and control during a
tactical situation and in addition to
give them practice in leadership.
The cadets, having been given pre-
vious instruction in attack forma-
tions and the employment of both
men and weapons are, by this field
problem, more able to understand
applications of the above concepts
in battle conditions.

The units in the assault are com-
manded by their own cadet officers
and both the commanders and the
members of the units are graded
and criticized as to their handling
of all matters during the taking of
the objective.

Mighty IBM Monster
Daily Miracles Of Computation

By KENNETH LANE
Tuesday Writer

One of Washington and Lee’s lat-
est newcomers has been creating
quite a stir in the science depart-
ment. Given the distinguished ti-
tle of “IBM 1620 Data Processing
System,” this voracious monster of
blinking lights and jostling levers
can do amazing wonders. With a
mere flick of the switch, it can re-
duce days of human labor to a mat-
ter of mere minutes.

The most frequent users of this
remarkable instrument are teachers
in the departments of psychology,
chemistry, and physics, who have
managed to keep the machine well-
nourished with endless quantities of
facts and figures. Insatiably, the
computer devours the multitude of
statistics, spewing out the correct
solutions without fail. For the com-
puter, it’s all in a day’s work.

One of the most prolific feeders
of the machine is Dr. Leonard Jar-
rard, assistant professor of psychol-
ogy, who is currently experiment-
ing on how to get the machine to
think like humans. Struggling with
such highsounding terms as “concept
formation” and “symbolic reason-
ing,” I listened as Dr. Jarrard ex-
plained to me his project.

The theory is that by analyzing
the way students solve problems, the
scientist can come up with some sort

 

of consistent pattern by which prob-
lems are reasoned out. Using stu-
dents as subjects, Dr. Jarrard has
done considerable experimenting,
hoping to use the data he has col-
lected to derive some basic rules of
the thought process involved. The
final step is to apply these rules to
a “program” adaptable to the ma-
chine.

It sounds somewhat complicated,
but what scientists are hoping for
is a machine which can simulate
the workings of the brain. And pro-
gress is being made; at Carnegie
Tech, for example, they have a ma-
chine which can carry on a pretty
competent game of chess.

Another project of the psychol-
ogy department is the use of the
machine for calculating results from
tests on drug reaction. A half doz-
en rats are injected with varying
amounts of a certain drug and their
reactions are studied. The object is
to see how fast the rat can learn to
press a bar at the right time to get
food. The result of these experi-
ments leads to a mass of numbers
which would normally take days
to solve.

Yet with amazing speed and dex-
terity, the IBM comes up with the
right answer in a matter of minutes.
Dr. Jarrard commented that a job
like this had taken a student three
afternoons to figure out by the desk

Performs

calculator. The IBM did it in four
minutes.

Dr. John Wise of the Chemistry
department is putting the machine
to use in his study of wave lengths.
He explained his project as “con-
verting observed wave lengths in
the spectrum of rare earth elements
to a measurement of the energy of
light.”

The result of such an experiment
will yield important information
about the details of the atomic
structure. But in getting these de-
tails, the scientist must take pages
and pages of data and put them all
together into a formula. Worked by
simple mathematics, the task is a
gigantic undertaking. However, a
problem that formerly took all af-
ternoon to solve was done by the
IBM in a fantastic six seconds.

Like Dr. Jarrard, Dr. Wise is also
using the machine to work out a
statistical analysis of the results of
lab experiments. This is especially
effective in checking the accuracy
of students’ experiments. Dr. Ed-
ward Turner of the physics depart-
ment is likewise using the machine
as a short-cut for figuring out the
standard deviation of his students’
grades. He is also letting students
use the machine to check the accur-
acy of their lab experiments. As far
as employing the IBM for research,
Dr. Turner has no immediate plans.

 

 

German Nationalism
Labeled “Potent Force”

underestimate the strength and pull
of German nationalism among those
30 and older.” Colvin, who holds a
Ph.D. from the University of Hei-
delberg, is a foreign affairs expert
who has done concentrated work in
the German field. He is a member
of Washington and Lee’s political
science department.

West Germany’s new generation,
said Colvin, is growing up political-
ly orientated to the West, but the
older people look to the East, where
they hope to regain the land lost
after World War II.

Only Russia can give back to Ger-
many the East Prussian lands which
are now a large segment of Po-
land; likewise, Russia stands be-
tween East and West Germany. For
this reason many Germans would
like to renounce Western ties, to
follow a policy of “enlightened self-
interest” in the hope of a reunited
Germany.

Colvin estimated that in ten years,
as new generations rise, Germany
may be reconciled to its present
frontiers.

The speaker traced Germany’s
moral rehabilitation since World
War II, pointing out her efforts to
identify herself with the West. He
mentioned German support of Is-
rael and the reversal from anti-
Semitism, and military alignment:
the 12 German divisions in NATO
are the largest contingent of the alli-
ance. He also cited German partici-
pation in the Common Market.

In spite of this rehabilitation,
said Colvin, most Germans cannot
forget that they belong to the only
country in Europe which has lands
claimed but not occupied. The
truncated yermany looks to a
feature in the East, where lie East
Germany, East Prussia (Poland),
and a part of Czechoslovakia from
which 3 1/2 million Germans were
expelled following World War II.

As Germany rebuilds and rearms,
she frightens countries who
hold historic German land; they look

Freshmen Given

Honor System
Explanation

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Rosie Page, senior Executive Com-
mitteeman, Thursday night gave an
eloquent and stirring defense of
Washington and Lee’s Honor Sys-
tem. He spoke at a compulsory
freshman assembly in Lee Chapel,
called by the EC following contro-
versy over honor trials held earlier
in the week. In these trials, two
students were found guilty of hon-
or violations and a third chose to
withdraw from the university rath-
er than stand trial. Strong freshman
sentiment against the action taken
by the EC resulted in the assembly’s
being called.

Page, after explaining the Honor
System and describing the method
by which suspected violators are
tried, told the freshman “this was
the system they had chosen to live
under.” He said he knew of none
better, after having examined simi-
lar systems at other colleges.

Both he and Student Body Presi-
dent Uncas McThenia suggested that
anyone who did not like the Honor
System “leave now.”

Comparing a “little bit of dis-
honesty” to a “little bit of preg-
nancy,” Page declared that there
was no such thing. He cited as an
honor violation any act of lying,
cheating, or stealing—and said, that
since there are no degrees of dis-
honesty, there can be no degrees
of punishment.

He accused the freshmen of criti-
cizing something that they “hadn’t
taken the trouble to find out about.”
and pleaded with them to seek out
an EC member if there were any
points about the Honor System they
still did not understand.

The Year of Big Changes

This year will have to go down in the books as the Year of
the Big Changes in student government at Washington and
Lee. We have been overwhelmed with proposals from the Ex-
ecutive Committee, the Interfraternity Council, the Dance
Board, and the faculty. At times it has been rather difficult to
keep up with all the changes that have been accepted, much
less the various proposals and counterproposals that didn’t.

Here’s a summary of what has been going on:

The Executive Committee has decided to present two ma-
jor constitutional changes to the student body, and rejected a

third. They want to:

Do away with the nominating convention for the
Big Seven offices and require instead that candidates
get their names on the ballots by presenting a petition

signed by 150 of their fellow students.

Turn Openings, Springs, and Finals weekends over
to the sophomore, junior, and senior classes, respective-
ly, but continue to elect the president of Fancy Dress

weekend in a student body-wide election.

The EC rejected various proposals to replace the
Publications Board representative with either a repre-
sentative-at-large or an additional junior class repre-

sentative.

The EC has also voted to submit a number of minor
changes and clarifications in the constitution to the student
body for a vote along with the major changes noted above.
They will probably submit the changes as a single draft for an
entirely new constitution. The EC has not yet decided whether
they will seek a vote on the new constitution at the regular

spring elections or at a special election.

The Interfraternity Council has meanwhile voted to en-
courage the houses to restrict combos on the nights of big
University dances and has put considerably more teeth into
their rules against abuses of pledge training. They have a com-
mittee studying the rush system at the present time and will
undoubtedly take some action on the rush system before the
year is out, if only to voice satisfaction with the present system.

While the pace of reform has left many of us rather out
of breath at times, it seems to this column that the changes have
been well thought-out on the whole. They have been thorough-
ly discussed by the organizations involved and deserve support

from the student body as a whole.

We are fortunate that we have had men of the caliber of
Uncas McThenia, Steve Galef, and Bob Doenges in office
when the pressure for change became overwhelming. They,
however, could not have done nearly so well, if they had not
been backed up by an exceptionally able crop of student lead-
ers in the various campus posts. We think that the success of
the reforms they have advocated will add further to W&L’s
reputation for sound, independent student government.

Dean Gilliam’s Illness

We were sorry to hear of Dean Gilliam’s heart attack Sun-
day. We are happy to report, however, that doctors report that
his condition is good and that he is resting comfortably.

We join with the entire University community in wishing

Mr. Gilliam a full and speedy recovery.

By TRACY HARRINGTON

It seems as if spring has finally
come to Lexington. Later sunsets,
baseball and not-so-cold weather
give us a pretty good indication that
it’s about time for Madras coats and
Goshen weekends again. Another
symbol of the new season that’s a
sure sign winter’s over at W&L is
the field training of our own citizen
soldiers—the spring tactical problem
of the ROTC department.

This week, the military students,
decked out in appropriately ivy
green fatigues and armed with the
deadly M-1 rifle, migrated en masse
to the hill behind the tennis courts.

Each platoon of thirty men, in turn,
had to “take the objective” under
what were supposed to be simulated
battle conditions. The objective was
the crest of the hill, protected by
four men with rifles and a machine
gun.

The afternoon’s activity began,
ungloriously, in front of Doremus
Gym. From there the platoon
marched around the athletic field,

 

“THE BATTLE

OF THE HILL”

 

by the stadium and the tennis courts,
and through a garbage dump to the
assembly field.

Heroes in Green

Next the thirty foot-weary sold-
iers headed off to the line of de-
parture. (That’s military for the
place where they start shooting at
each other.) This was the base of
the hill that had to be taken, and on
top of which perched the four “en-
emies” with the machine gun and
individual rifles.

By this time our heroes in green
were muddy, tired, and ready to quit
playing. But they had to charge
Lexington’s counterpart of San Juan
Hill. About halfway up the hill, the
enemy started firing. The charging
soldiers started firing, too—but ran
into a little trouble when about half
the guns jammed. (It was discovered
later, according to an upperclass
ROTC student, that the govern-
ment had put ammunition in the
clips crooked. Oh, well...every-
body makes mistakes now and then.)

In the “actual combat situation,”

 

two main problems arose: either the
troops ignored the machine gun fire
and refused to hit the dirt like they
were supposed to, or they hit the
dirt and stayed there. It didn’t real-
ly matter, though—blank amuni-
tion was being used and they all
knew it.

No Ammunition

Valor prevailed. The four agres-
sors were taken by the thirty-man
platoons and casualties were kept
down to a few stumped toes and
muddy faces. With the hill in their
possession, the triumphant thirty
prepared for a counter-attack which
the defeated four were expected to
launch. They ran into a little troub-
le here, too; everyone had been good
about holding onto their rifles, and
not a one was lost—but some of the
befuddled foot soldiers were out of
ammunition. They just stood around
and tried to look inconspicuous dur-
ing the counterattack, which is
about as good a policy to follow as
any other in their predicament. At
any rate, they must have not been

 

Ah, Spring! Goshen, Madras, War Games

too decisive, for the agressors were
again thrown back in the counter-
attack.

After this, the game was over and
the good guys got with the bad guys
to hear from those who knew what
they had done wrong. The rest of
the afternoon and early evening was
spent in cleaing the dirty guns, re-
hashing the tactical blunders, and
trying to forget that they might have
to do it with real bullets someday.

The ROTC upperclassmen quoted
above estimated that if the ammuni-
tion had been real under the same
circumstances, 75 per cent of the
people involved would have been
killed. But, then, he’s not an expert.
Maybe 80 per cent of them would
have gotten it.

At any rate, the one week’s War
of the Hill is over, and as we turn
our minds to important things like
Spring Vacation and student elec-
tions, dirty fatigues and used-up
blanks are the only remnants we
have of the first true sign of spring
at W&L.

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

 

To the Editor:

The recent finding of the Execu-
tive Committee with regard to three
students having violated the Hon-
or System does not seem to have
met with unanimous approval on the
part of the student body. The sad
part of any approval-disapproval on
the part of the students seems to lie
in the dilemma that those members
of the student body disapproving
can only do so on the basis of what
they hear to be the true facts. The
true facts upon which the final de-
termination is based are of course
secreted and if someone like my-
self chooses to voice an opinion he
can only reiterate and think about
those facts he has heard from the
grapevine. Hearsay is the word I am
looking for and so be it. If what I
have heard was not the basis of the
decision by the E.C. then I apologize.
If what I have heard are the facts
then I content myself with disagree-
ing.

I disagree as a law student from
a legal standpoint and as a dorm
counselor having had very close
contact with one of the individuals
involved.I disagree from an objec-
tive standpoint strongly feeling that

 

 

Law Student Objects To EC Decision

I know the character of one parti-
cular individual proscribed.

From a strictly legal standpoint,
one who steals does an act which
deprives another of his property.
The act of itself is not enough to
convict a person. That person must
also have had the mental requisite
of intention to steal. In legal terms,
a concurrence of the act of stealing
and the intention to so steal are nec-
essary to convict for larceny. The
theory I would like to advance may
not find approval in a court of law.
It probably was not considered in
our “court of law” on the campus,
but it may appeal to reason which
sometimes beats the hell out of
whatever other source we tap.

Suppose someone comes into my
room with the idea of picking up
some quick date money and filches
five dollars from my desk—he is a
thief. He intends to deprive me of
my property and does so. Unfor-
tunately for the E.C. it was not this
type of a situation. The facts were
very much more complex and as is
often said hard cases make poor law.
Remember now that I only disagree
and I am not saying who is right.

We Need Something More

By SPUD SLATER

Three of our brethren have left
school this week. Rumor has it that
they stole a 5-cent candy bar. Sin-
ners that they are, they have been
driven out of Eden. God be with
them. He moves in mysterious ways.

O, there is no god but the honor
system and the executive committee
is his prophet. How wonderous that
we can revere a system...a system.

Praise be for all blessings. He is
a local deity, this god of ours, whose
power is limited in time and space.
True faith in him endures 4 years
only, and in this place alone. Bless
the honor which we gain through
the sacrament of the pledge. What a
relief that the burden of this faith
is not imposed forever.

For where is honor without the
written affirmation? Write it not
and you need not be honest? I re-
nounce this god, for I revere no sys-
tem. I renounce the written pledge,
for what decency I may have lies
unseen within me. Yet I do affirm
unqualifiedly that sense of honor
which I hope was in me long be-
fore I pledged a paper; that honor
which transcends the limits of time
and space and a fallible, idolized

 

system.
¢* @

How sad it is that we must take
on honor only when we come to this
academy of better men! How sad that
we were not true before! How sad
that we will not have to be honor-
able when we go from this place!

Yet will we not be required to be
honest men, even when the bonds
of fear have been broken? (For this
god is a god of fear, this system we
revere; and so faith is invalid. What
honor can there be when fear en-
forces adherence? and when adher-
ence is only a temporary thing?)
Will there be no inward desire for
honor afterwards?

There can be—if we rise above
the limits of this system, if we rise
above unquestioning faith, unques-
tioning acceptance. For I say that
you cannot believe in this system
unless you believe in something
higher. And that which is higher
must be found within you. Conceive
your honor out of sincere devotion.

Accept not unquestioningly the
workings of this god of a system.

The South In The Sixties—Politics

 

Dissolution Of ‘Solid South’ Began With New Deal

By MR. R. N. LATTURE
Professor of Political Science

For a long time it was customary to speak of the
Solid South meaning that the Democratic candidate
for the presidency could definitely count on the entire
electoral vote of the southern states. In those days, be-
cause of the two-thirds rule of the national convention
of the Democratic party, the delegates from the South
could virtually veto the nomination of a presidential
candidate who was not acceptable to the South. The
political leaders of the South, mindful of the import-
ance of foreign markets for cotton, tobacco and rice,
were generally international in outlook.

This extraordinary political cohesion was due, of
course, to common memories of war and reconstruc-
tion, to cultural and religious values which they
shared, and to their strong feelings about maintaining
white supremacy. In some well-known instances, dem-
agogues rose to power on the strength of race preju-
dice.

In recent years there has been a steady growth in
industry in the South, a parallel growth of popula-
tion in the cities and a corresponding decline in the
relative importance of agriculture. Some of the south-
ern industries, such as textiles, confronted with com-
petition from abroad, are joining in the demand for
tariff protection.

Effects of the New Deal

Beginning with the New Deal legislation the leaders
of the Democratic party in the South have had difficul-
ty in supporting the party’s candidates for national of-
fice and the platforms on which they stood. The nation-
al leaders of the party have found it necessary to satisfy
the demands of the Democratic organizations in the
cities of the North. These organizations depend for their
existence on the votes of wage earners, of immigrants,
of Negroes, and of other minority groups. The national
leaders promise to advance the interests of workers, to

increase the minimum wage, to promote better housing,
to provide work or compensation for the unemployed,
and to use federal funds for other welfare purposes.
They press for civil rights legislation, for voting rights
for Negroes, for the desegregation of schools, and for
the desegregation of transportation and recreational
facilities. The national leaders of the party urge fed-
eral aid for the public schools and medical aid for
the aged.

Southern political leaders, backed by their constitu-
ents, oppose practically all of these programs. Follow-
ing the leadership of the senior senator from Virginia,
they are opposed to programs requiring large-scale
spending. Southern congressmen often unite with Re-
publicans to defeat liberal proposals. They are quite
willing to cooperate with Republicans along economic
lines in return for their support in blocking civil rights
legislation.

North vs. South

It’s quite evident that a great gulf separates the
northern and southern Democrats. In 1928 Mr. Hoover
carried Virginia and five other southern states. In
1948 a number of southern delegates bolted the Conven-
tion in Philadelphia when Mr. Truman was nominated
and a liberal platform adopted. J. Strom Thurmond
of South Carolina and Fielding Wright of Mississippi
led a Dixiecrat movement in opposition to the civil
rights commitments of the party program. These gen-
tlemen were the governors of the two states with the
highest proportion of Negro population. Alabama and
Louisiana joined South Carolina and Mississippi in giv-
ing their electoral votes to the Dixiecrat candidates.

In the last presidential election the feelings of
Mississippi voters were so intense that they rejected
the candidates and platforms of both major parties and
chose as electors men who were not committed to any
party. These electors cast their ballots for Senator
Byrd for President and for Senator Goldwater for
Vice President.

With reference to Mississippi, mention should be

made of the White Citizens Councils which completely
dominate the political life of that state.
Republicans in Virginia

In the last three presidential elections the voters of
Virginia have cast a majority of their ballots for the
Republican candidates. Senator Byrd, who is held in
high esteem all over the nation, has refused to speak in
behalf of the Democratic candidates. Mr. Byrd is op-
posed to the President’s proposal that the United States
purchase United Nations bonds to enable that body to
continue its functions. Almost the last action taken by
the Virginia legislature before its recent adjournment
was to pass a resolution urging Congress not to buy
United Nations bonds.

A large proportion of the voters in Virginia, as in
other southern states, resents civil rights legislation,
the Supreme Court decision calling for the desegre-
gation of schools, the granting of large sums of money
to aid in the underdeveloped countries, the proposal
to appropriate federal funds for school purposes and
the continued expenditures of federal funds for wel-
fare purposes.

The Supreme Court Decision

The decision in 1954, directing the desegregation of
schools, had a profound impact on the political life of
the South. The reaction of the political leaders has
been overwhelmingly hostile both to the decision and
to efforts to enforce it. The story of Little Rock and
of Prince Edward County, in Virginia, is well known
not only in America but in distant lands. The Com-
munists have seen to that. The application of desegre-
gation principles to transportation and recreational
facilities has met with stubborn resistance. The steps
taken by the Civil Rights Commission to open voting
privileges to Negroes has aroused vigorous reactions
in black-belt areas. Bus boycotts by Negroes, “sit-in”
demonstrations, and “Freedom Riders” led by non-
southerners have aroused bitter feelings. The mere
mention of NAACP or of Dr. Martin Luther King is

enough to cause the loyal southerner’s blood pressure
to rise. However, the non-violent methods used by
Negro leaders have kept violence to a surprisingly
low minimum.

It is noteworthy, also, that eight years after the
Supreme Court’s desegregation decision no Negro
child has been admitted to any white public school
in South Carolina, Alabama, or Mississippi.

The white primary laws have been declared un-
constitutional. There is a movement in Congress this
week to outlaw the use by states of the poll tax and
literacy tests as conditions for voting in federal elec-
tions. If this movement starts to gain headway South-
ern Congressmen will resort to filbustering and other
tactics which they have used often and effectively to
protect the traditional patterns of race relations in the
South.

Colorful Personalities

The South has given the nation its full share of
colorful political personalities. Among them are Huey
Long, of Louisiana, and Bilbo, of Mississippi. A much
larger number of favorably known southern leaders
are such men as Senator Fulbright, of Arkansas, and
Senator Byrd, of Virginia, or Representatives Carl Vin-
son, of Georgia, and Howard Smith, of Virginia.

These and other members of Congress from the
South have exerted great influence in the nation’s
politics. Most of them have gained their power through
chairmanships of congressional committeees. Being
from one-party states they are re-elected term after
term. Through the operation of the seniority principle
they eventually become chairmen of powerful com-
mittees when the Democratic party is in majority in
the house in which they hold membership. The chair-

Australians Top General Stickmen, 10-8

4-4 Deadlock Broken
In Third Period Flurry

Australia’s All-Star lacrosse team sloshed to a 10-8 win
over Washington and Lee’s Generals Wednesday in the third
game of an extended United States tour for the Aussies.

Earlier this month, the Australians dumped Duke 15-3,
and lost to the University of Virginia 19-15.

Aussies broke down a 4-4 deadlock with three goals in the third
period. Neill and Campbell each scored once during the stanza.

Battling back, W&L trimmed the*
Australians’ margin to 8-7 midway
the fourth period on two straight
goals by midfielder John McDaniel,
but the Generals never got any
closer.

Key Men

Neill and Campbell were the key
men in the Aussie’s attack with
three goals apiece. Neill also had one
assist.

The visitors struck first, jumping
off to a 3-1 lead in the opening peri-
od as attackman Brian Griffin scored
twice.

By halftime the Generals had
moved into a 4-4 tie on scores by
defenseman Bart Mitchell, midfield-
er Charlie Gummey and attackman
Carroll Klingelhofer.

First Game

Senior Ray Miller, playing his first
game at goal for W&L, turned in a
standout performance. The former
attackman was credited with 16
saves, including several on shots
which appeared to be goals.

Australia now is 2-1 for its Am-
erican tour, having previously beat-
en Duke and lost to Virginia. The
visitors’ next game is scheduled
Saturday at College Park, Md.,
against Maryland’s powerful Terps.

 

  
 
 

 

 

ROTC, Weather
Delay Baseball

Washington and Lee’s promising
baseball team has been having trou-
ble getting any practice so far this
spring. A combination of bad weath-
er, ROTC, and outside activities
have held practice time to a mini-
mum.

The baseballers were behind
Springfield College 4-5 on Monday,
when bad weather and advancing
darkness called the game to a halt.
Sophomore Brice Gamber pitched
the first two innings but still suffers
from some early-season wildness.
Senior righthander Phil Sharp was
impressive in a _ third-inning ap-
pearance against the Massachusetts
team.

Lyles singled out center-fielder
Robin Wood, catcher Jim Russ, right
fielder Buck Rose, and second base-
man Park Gilmore for outstanding
performances so far. Wood smacked
a 350-foot double against Spring-
field.

W&L lost a chance for another
practice game when Springfield
pulled out of town, hoping to find
better weather elsewhere.

 

 

 

 

Dartmouth First
Foe for Linkmen

Coach Cy Twombly’s Washington
and Lee golf team plays its first
match of the season against Dart-
mouth Saturday at the Lexington
Golf and Country Club.

The Generals with six lettermen
returning from last year’s team, are
favored against Dartmouth, but
Twombly is worried because bad
weather has hampered spring prac-
tice.

“We've just had about three days
of good weather since February,
and our boys haven’t been able to
get on the course too much,” he
said.

Letter To The Editor

(Continued from page 2)

We have already empowered the
E.C. to determine the right answer
and the only power left is one of
disagreement.

If someone’s paramount and true
intention was to beat the machine
in the playful and destructive sense
of an eighteen-year-old boy as op-
posed to the intention to steal candy
bars, which the E.C., in my opinion,
must have found to properly con-
vict him of stealing, then a hair-
line distinction properly made could
have prevented an injustice as I see
it. I feel very strongly that this
student would not have taken some-

thing from that machine if the front
of it was off and the property was
exposed. I therefore feel he did not
have the requisite specific intention
to steal but had the overriding
“slap-his-hand” intention to play
around with the machine if such a
distinction could possibly be rec-
ognized.

Taking into consideration the age
and general character of the indi-
vidual, whom I feel to be a gentle-
man, I believe that his true inten-
tion would not be that of a thief.
There are very few of us who
haven’t at one time or another
found delight in beating a machine.
How many times has that machine
beaten us! At the same time, I

 

know none of us would take that

candy bar from the guy next door.
I feel this individual would not
have either. I feel this makes him
like us, a little different than the
thief who we would all agree should
be expelled for stealing. Somehow
this makes some sense to me, how-
ever little it made to the E.C. Mon-
day night.

As I have already stated I simply
disagree with the decision. I know
most of the students on the E.C.
and have the highest respect for
each and every one of them. There
is no doubt in my mind that the
interests of our Honor System as
well as the interests of the students
immediately concerned were given
the greatest of consideration.

Christian Declines To Run For President

By TUESDAY STAFF WRITERS

The Tuesday Edition learned today that Meade Christian,
Phi Gam rising senior, who had been mentioned as the
leading Independent Party Candidate for the presidency of
the Student Body will not run in the April election.

Christian, who placed high in a sample poll which was
run in last Tuesday’s paper, stated that outside considera-
tions were the reasons for not wanting to run.

Christian stated in an interview today that “In con-
sideration of the sum total of other duties and responsi-
bilities that I have taken on for next year, I do not feel that
I can efficiently carry out these responsibilities along

Christian made it clear that this did not mean that he
would not be available to serve the student body in other
capacities. He stated: “While I realize that the office of Stu-
dent Body President may offer more opportunity for ser-
vice than any one of my other duties, I feel that the sum
total, if given the proper consideration, will permit me to
serve the University in a number of capacities. I do not want
to sacrifice these opportunities.”

Christian’s announcement could have a profound effect
upon the campus political situation. As the leading candidate

from the Independent

Campus comment on the issue met with serious replies.
Chairman of the Independent Party, Spud Slater, stated:
he is the most qualified and capable member of the Student

position. I personally hope that he
decides to run for the good of the

University and for the good of the party.”
University Party Chairman, Grantham Couth, was un-
available for comment.

IFC Passes Rule
On Combo Time

A resolution limiting the combos of fraternities on Friday
nights of dance set weekends officially was voted into the IFC
Constitution at last night’s regular meeting.

Passed last week for the first time, the resolution had to].

pass the fraternity group twice before it could become a part

of the IFC Constitution.

The proposal was submitted last
week by Ross Kyger, Kappa Sig
junior, and Tony Schlesinger, ZBT
junior.

The new rules are designed to
eliminate a large amount of con-
flict that exists between fraternity
combos and University sponsored
dance functions.

The only change made to the pro-
posals which was presented last
week was a clarification of the
“closed party” clause.

Not To Other Students

The IFC felt that “closed” meant
only to Washington and Lee stu-
dents, and not to students from oth-
er schools.

The proposal in effect states:

1, All fraternity combo parties
in conflict with University Spon-
sored dances on Friday nights of
dance weekends will be closed.
Closed is to be defined as mem-
bers of one fraternity only and
the party shall be held in the
house of that fraternity.

2. No fraternity may compel
one of its members to pay an ex-
tra social assessment for said com-
bo to be held in conflict ...if that

Johns Hopkins University will speak
tonight on “The Doldrums of Belief:
Our Land and Our Tradition.”

Dr. Carl B. Swisher, a former
president of the American Politi-
cal Science Association, will speak
in duPont Auditorium at 8:15 p.m.

Speaking under the sponsorship
of the University’s department of
political science and the University
Center in Virginia, Dr. Swisher is a
Thomas P. Stran professor at Johns
Hopkins.

Dr. Swisher is a former special
assistant to the Attorney General
of the United States.

Court.

member wishes to attend the
dance instead of the combo party.

IFC President Bob Doenges, Sig-
ma Chi senior, made the following
statement to the Ring-tum Phi late
last night.

Commends Schlesinger, Kyger

“T would like to commend Tony

Schlesinger and Ross Kyger,” he]!

said, “for their industry and in-
terest in coming up with this solu-
tion after the previous one had
been voted down.”

“Will Bring About Solution”

“This new IFC amendment, I
feel, will bring about a gradual
and effective solution to the com-
bo-University dance conflict. It
does not radically forbid the
combos at any time, but it does
provide the rules to prevent any
slight or large majority in any
house from forcing their will for
a combo upon a minority.”

Consequently, he added, I feel
that each fraternity will re-ex-
amine the fallacious necessity
of having a Friday night combo.

“Once they see the University
is providing much better enter-
tainment.” he continued, “and that
a number of their own members do
not want a combo conflicting with
the University function, there will
be few combos on Friday nights of
any dance set.

“... Responsible Action”

“The IFC realized this,” Doenges
stated, “in voting for the amend-
ment unanimously for two weeks
in succession, and I am_ very
pleased to see it taking this con-
structive and responsible action.”

The plan will not got into effect
until next year.

 

Debate Team Places Third
In Regional Tournament

Washington and Lee debaters cap-
tured third place in an invitational
tournament held Saturday at Bal-
timore, Md.

The novice team of freshmen
Steve Smith and Malcolm Morris
took part in eight rounds of compe-
tition, debating both the affirmative
and negative sides of the question.

On an individual merit basis,
Smith was named fifth affirmative
speaker out of a field of 20 debat-
ers.

 

 

SCC Hits

Public Drinking

 

;

The Student Control Committee in a recent meeting voiced its dis-
approval at the growing number of reported incidents of public drink-
ing on the part of Washington and Lee students.

It is felt by the Committee that such action not only places a stu-
dent in a position of possible involvement with the police, but that it
leaves a poor impression with the members of the community or visitors
to the campus who view the conduct of W&L students.

In reaching the decision to halt such conduct on the part of stu-
dents, the Committee has expressed its hope that the Student Body
will assume the responsibility necessary to prevent the further dis-

play of such incidents,

Should such responsibility not be forthcoming, the Committee has
stated that individuals would be liable for any reported breach of con-
duct (i.e. consuming alcoholic beverages in public.)

The Committee has already stated before the IFC that any report of
a fraternity gathering at which a large contingent of members public-
ly consume beverages will be submitted to the Faculty Committee on

Fraternities for possible remedy.

houses in both parties, the opinions expressed revealed vari-

* George Honts, President of Delta

Tau Delta, commented. “I express
regrets over the announcement that
Meade Christian will not be a can-
didate for the office of Student Body

President. He is the most qualified*

in the University and in the party.

‘| At this time the University needs

able leadership and he is one of the
3 or 4 that is best able to give it. His
refusal to run will be a detriment
to the University and to the party.”

Jim Russ, president of Phi Kappa
Psi, stated that Christian should
definitely serve on the EC in some
capacity even if it is not as presi-
dent. He further stated that the par-
ty has several other qualified can-
didates which they can call upon to
run.

Tom Rains, president of the KA
house, expressed beliefs that the
University party would benefit from
Christian’s not running. I feel that
the Independent Party’s chances for
success have been seriously hurt by
Christian’s not running.”

Bill Lowry, NFU, stated “Meade
would do well in any position,” and
hoped that he would continue to
serve the student body in some cap-
acity. However, he felt that the Uni-
versity party would be placed in a
better position because of the de-

:| cision by Christian.

Kappa Sig president, Rick Frisbie,
believed that Christian would be the
number one candidate of the Inde-
pendent Party. His refusal to run
would not give the party much
chance. “However,” he stated, “Don’t
count us out, we still have Payne
and Montgomery.”

Forensic Union
Hears Debaters

Washington and Lee’s crack de-
bate team got in more practice last
night on a new debate question as
they appeared before a meeting of
th Forensic Union.

The faculty and student body was
split on a decision on the question
“Resolved: That capital punishment
should be abolished.”

The student vote was 22-6 in
favor of the negative team, with
many of the more than 40 students
present abstaining. Members of
the faculty present voted 5-0 for
the affirmative team.

The affirmative team for this
cross-examination debate was com-
posed of Al Eckes and Bill Noell.
Pete Straub and Bill Boardman took
the negative side. The major argu-
ments revolved around the question
of whether capital punishment was a
determent to crime or not.

Bahama
Holiday
Is Theme

By STEVE GUILD

Executive News Editor

The theme of Spring
Dances this year will center
around a “Bahama Holiday,”
it was announced today.

Charlie McCord, president of the
dance set, said that the decorations
will have a West Indies influence in
keeping with the tone of the con-
certs which this year are concen-
trated on Caribbean and American
folk music.

Major Work By Babcock

The major part of the work on the
decorations is being handled by Jud
Babcock, SAE junior.

There will be murals around the
walls portraying the various cus-
toms and traditions of the West
Indies, McCord, a Beta junior, said.

The greatest portion of the dec-
orations, however, will be cen-
tered around the stage areas. A
bamboo hut will be built over
the stage to heighten the effect
of the island atmosphere.

The main portion of the stage
will consist of a ramp-way built
out into the audience so that a
better view is afforded the audi-
ences.

Different Lighting System

Also featured at Spring Dances
will be a different lighting system.
Several large spotlights will be
rented for use during the concerts,
McCord said.

Springs will feature primarily
American and West Indian folk mu-
sic. The Friday night concert will
feature Leon Bibb and Meg Welles.
Leon Bibb’s style has been com-

 

The Dance Board will make
available to any student or guest
not holding a dance plan a com-
bination ticket for both Spring
concerts, The ticket will cost $7.50
and will admit the holder to both
concerts. The price for a single
concert will be $5.00

 

pared to Belafonte’s by several crit-
ics, and his program will be cen-
tered around Carribean folk songs.

Although Bibb sings a_ great
many folk songs, as if he had
lived with them all his life, he is
not primarily a folk singer. He had
a varied career in the entertain-
ment world.

He has sung in theatres, night
clubs, small informal halls, and in
big open air festivals.

Critics Hail

Critics have hailed him as a top
interpreter of folk music. They
have said that his voice is both mov-
ing and flexible.

Dance Board President Steve
Galef said recently that Bibb’s
appearance at W&L is part of a
continuing trend to provide more
versatile entertainment for the
Student Body.

Bibb and Meg Welles will appear
Friday night from 8 to 10 p.m. in
the Gym.

A torn, tattered sign, familiar to all Ring-tum Phi staffers

All the Ring-tum Phi needs is a small office where it can
put a table, a couple of typewriters, and a file.

At present it is virtually impossible to find a back issue of
the paper or an old picture that could be used again.

The proofreaders, re-writers, headline writers, and make-up
men connot do as good a job as we would like to do because
we have no adequate place to work. Space is needed and need-
ed badly in the vicinity of the print shop.

While R-t P staff members are stuffed into the print shop
like sardines, there is a large ‘‘unused”’ space in the very next
building. A big room in the IBM building has been vacated by
the Civil Defense and now contains one computer, which takes
up approximately 15 per cent of the room.

Desperately, we ask: may the Ring-tum Phi have some of
this “unused” space in the IBM building, or must it continue
suffering from the “cracker box’’ conditions of the print shop.

Ask for Information

Most of the children’s letters ask
for information about the life of
Lee, the recumbent statue, Lee’s
family, Traveller, and other ques-
tions of this nature. But ever so
often, an odd one will come in.

Some ask for Virginia history.
These get an answer referring
them to some other source. A girl
in Layton, Utah, once wrote and
asked not only for information
about Lee, but for some on Bess
Truman. She was referred to the
Truman Library in Independence,
Missouri.

Not all of the letters come from
children, however. There’s one in
the files from a man in Los Ange-
les, who wanted to know wheng
Traveller died, where he was first
buried, and when the body was ex-
humed and put in the glass case in
Lee Chapel.

Another man wrote asking for the
history of Lee’s physical and men-
tal condition from childhood to
adulthood.

And everybody seems to ask
“Where are Lee and his family
buried?”

Rowe and his secretary answer
all these things somehow, often re-
ferring the writer to another source.
“They ask questions we can’t an-
swer,” Rowe said, “but we try to

answer them anyway.”

Press Representation To The EC

The E.C., we are happy to report, has at last opened the
legislative meetings to members of the campus press.

We feel that this move not only will allow the Student
Body to get more and better information concerning the E.C.,
but that criticism leveled at the E.C. will also drop.

Although we recognize the opening of the meetings to the
press as being a healthy step forward, we must add that we are
somewhat disappointed at the move not being offered as a
constitutional amendment.

Even though our problem is solved for this year, what
about the years to come? What’s to guarantee that the meet-
ings will always be open to the press?

End Of The ‘Communism’ Series

Today marks the final publishing of the Tuesday Edi-
tion’s series, “Washington and Lee Looks At Communism.”

The nine-part series, which was written by W&L fac-
ulty members, was designed to give the student body a
better look at the threat which faces the free world. We
hope the series served this purpose.

 

And questions come in about
the recumbent statue. Who did it?
how much does it weigh? When
was it done? How did they get it
here? And how many souvenir
chips have been taken from it?
What else can you tell me about
the “sarcophagus”?

All the letters get answers. This
sometimes starts a chain reaction.
Somebody will mention the cour-
teous reply or information they got

 

ership in the year to come be-

between Spring Dances and exams—there are only

cause of the period of transition in which we now
find ourselves, and these unsolved problems.

For better or worse the last election aroused stu-
dent interest in student affairs and the non-fraterni-
ty men to be vocal in their criticisms.

A student body position is, apparently, no bed
of roses these days, and, thus, there is all the more
need for aggressive leadership. These men who are

qualified and experienced should come out with

positive programs in a positive manner so that the
interest may be maintained at a high level and the

two week-ends which are really available.

Fortunately the IFC and the faculty has so far
been very co-operative in “bending the rule” when
necessary, but it’s a lot of extra trouble for them
and for the Houses to initiate and act upon a
special requests for these situations.

Maybe we could get a special, permanent ruling
in such instances?

Cuba Causes U.S. To See Red Threat At Back Door

By DR. L. F. SENSABAUGH

Only a short time ago, few peo-
ple in the United States were
aware that Communism existed in
Latin America. But a revolution
which led to the establishment
of a Communist government in
Cuba has suddenly changed our
thinking. Now we are painfully
aware of this unwanted govern-
ment even though we may not
yet recognize the extent and the
seriousness of the overall threat.

It would be dangerous for us to
eonclude that the Castro regime
represents the only Marxist-Len-
inist penetration into this hemis-
phere. It is true that Cuba is the
only nation that has an out and
out Communist government, but
in some of the other countries the
Communist parties are fairly large
and their fellow-travelers are ev-
en more numerous, At the start of
the present decade, Argentina had

some 80,000 Communists, Brazil
was second with about 50,000,
Venezuela had some 40,000 and

Chile around 25,000. The number
of members in other countries
varied from a mere 200 in Nic-
aragua to 5000 in Mexico and 6000
in Peru. Some of the Latin Am-
erican countries have made the
party illegal; other states allow
the Communists to function. And
there is a trend today for the Lat-
in American countries to establish

diplomatic relations with Russia
and China.

Before continuing with the na-
ture of and the activities of the
Communists in Latin America, it
is fitting to comment on the posi-
tion of left-wing movements
which are not Communistic. There
are many of them, and their mem-
bers have tried for a long time
to bring about reforms that would
make the countries less suscep-
tible to Communist propaganda.
These groups are quite liberal and
some even radical but they are
not Marxist. The Aprista move-
ment in Peru and the Accion
Democratica in Venezuela are
good examples of the leftist move-
ments. The future of real democ-
racy in Latin America could well
rest with these groups. Whether
we like them or not, the choice
may be between them and the
Communists.

There seems to be a belief in
this country that these organiza-
tions cooperate too often with the
Communists. This may be true,
but there is also evidence that the
right-wing groups have not hesi-
tated to cooperate with the Com-
munists, if it was to their advan-
tage. Several years ago, a Unit-
ed States senator submitted a re-
port on Communist activities in
Latin America.

The report stated that the Dom-
inican dictator, Rafael Leonidas
Trujillo, was the constant foe of
Communism. What the report did
not state was that Trujillo in 1943
ordered his labor organizations to
join the Communist-controlled
labor groups. Nor was there any
reference to the fact that three
years later the same dictator made
a deal with exiled Dominican

Communists to return to their na-
tive land and participate in a
democratic “election.” The party
was legalized for the occasion.
Although the Communist party
in Argentina went underground in
1948, after being outlawed, Juan
Domingo Peron’s henchmen tried
to strike a bargain with the Com-
munists during the election of
1946. The Peronistas were willing

WEL Looks At Communism

Last Of A Series

This is the last in a series of nine ar-

ticles by m

embers of the Washington

and Lee faculty dealing with Commun-

ism and its

various aspects.

Dr. Leon F. Sensabaugh’s article,
Communism and Latin America, is per-
haps one of the most important of the
series.

He points out that until the Castro

to legalize the Communist party
and allow a Communist press if
it would support Peron. The Com-
munists refused.

In 1945, Getulio Vargas, dictator
of Brazil for fifteen years, released
Brazil’s number one Communist,
Luiz Carlos Prestes, from ‘prison.
About a month later, Prestes
spoke to some 70,000 people in Rio
and urged that Vargas should not
resign. Bargains were denied, but
the Communists polled 700,000
votes in the election of that year.

But to return to the Communists
themselves. Their parties came in-
to existence in Latin America
within a few years after the Revo-
lution of 1917. Many of those who
joined had been anarchists or so-
cialists and had brought their
radical ideas from Spain and It-
aly. The Communist party was or-
ganized in Mexico in 1919, in
Uruguay in 1920 and in Brazil and
Chile in 1921. Other parties came
into existence in subsequent
years; the one in Bolivia was not
formed until 1949.

For the most part, the Commun-
ist party in Latin America has fol-
lowed the usual party line from
Moscow. They followed Lenin,
then Stalin and now Khrushchev;
they have been opposition parties
and have cooperated in Popular
Fronts. They opposed Fascism;
they opposed the war until Ger-

many attacked Russia; then they
espoused the cause of the demo-
cratic allies.

In recent years, the Communists
have supported the strongly-na-
tionalistic elements in Latin Am-
erica and of course have joined in
the hue and cry against American
imperialism. In some instances, the
Communists have been successful
in infiltrating the several armies.
This was especially true in Brazil
in the 1920’s and 1930's.

Pitching Is Ninety Per Cent

Of Baseball Bemoans Lyles

By HARRY MEEM
Staff Writer

“Pitching is ninety per cent of
baseball.”

This statement has been attrib-
uted to several major league man-
agers over the years, and most re-
cently to Paul Richards, one-time
manager of the Chicago White Sox
and Baltimore Orioles and now gen-
eral manager of the National
League’s new Houston franchise.

Whatever its origin, Washington
and Lee baseball coach Joe Lyles
isn’t about to dispute this axiom.

He’s said before, and probably
will say again before the Gen-
erals wind up their season, that
the team’s success depends on how
well his pitchers come through.

At present, he’s got six working
out, four righthanders and two
southpaws. There’s veteran strength
in senior Phil Sharp, a righthander,
and sophomore Brice Gamber, a
southpaw with a 1-1 record last
year.

To back them up, there are
righthanders Jim Gwinn, a senior
back after a two-year absence,

search of sunnier climes.

Saturday and Sunday Lyles held
scrimmage games, pitting his “A”
squad, made up chiefly of veterans,
against a “B” squad of freshmen
and reserves.

In two seven inning games Sat-
urday, and an eight inning affair
Sunday, he got a good chance to
see his pitchers under fire.

Gamber hurled five innings Sat-
urday, and looked “very impressive”
once he settled down. The tall
southpaw with the pretzel motion
has a good chance of being the
pitcher for the Generals’ opener
next Saturday at Elon.

Gwinn looked “fairly good” in

 

the innings he pitched Saturday.
But the surprise came Sunday.

Wigert, pitching for the “B”
squad, threw six innings of no-hit
ball. He was troubled by wildness,
which made for lots of walks and
an eventual 5-5 tie after eight, but
the wildness served one constructive
purpose in keeping the opposing hit-
ters from digging in.

McGowin, pitching for the “A”
squad, also looked good.

The hitters got in their licks
over the weekend, despite all this
sharp pitching. Ned Hobbs got a
360-foot homer, rightfielder Buck
Rose got two hits, Chuck Lane
got two, and Mike Monier got
what Lyles called a “good hit.”

Communism In Cuba Threatens

Our Very Way Of Life Here

(Continued from page 2)

In some countries, the Com-
munist party is a real threat to
the existing government. It is not
necessarily true that the people as
a whole would select a Commun-
ist regime, but they could sud-
denly find themselves with one.
Take Brazil, for example. Francis-
co Juliao, who has admitted his
Marxist leanings, is the leader of
the farmers of the drought-ridden
northeast. These people are des-
perate; the government at Rio has
done little to alleviate their suf-
fering. Luiz Carlos Prestes still
seems to have an almost mystical
influence over many Brazilians.

The small middle class has been
almost wiped out by the fantastic
inflation, and Brazilians as a whole
are surely aware of the wrong-
doings of their political and eco-
nomic leaders. Brazil is on the
verge of an explosion; the Com-
munists could take advantage of
this situation. President Kennedy’s
reluctance to press Brazil over the
confiscation of an American-
owned telephone company by the
governor of Rio Grande do Sul
may indicate how delicate the sit-
uation is.

President Miguel Ydigoras Fu-
entes of Guatemala has stated that
the recent and serious troubles in
his country have come from the

Communists, especially those from
Cuba. The United States may have
thought that it settled the Guate-
mala affair years ago in forcing
Jacobo Arbenz Guzman from the
presidency. Now the problem has
some up again,

Communism in Latin America
poses a serious threat to the peace
and safety of this hemisphere; it
is a greater danger than existed in
the 1820’s when President Mon-
roe, disturbed by the Holy Alli-
ance, made his now-famous pro-
ouncement. Then, the Latin Am-
erican states had doubts about
the danger, and it appears that
many of them today have doubts
about the Communist danger.
Secretary Dulles at Caracas and
Secretary Rusk at Punta del Este
had to struggle to get common
action against the Communist
threat. The old fear of interven-
tion from the north influences the
attitude of the larger Latin Am-
erican states.

It is going to be really hard to
convince these same states of the
imminent peril of international
Communism. If we are unsuccess-
ful, it may be necessary to resorgy
to open unilateral action, although
such action would reverse the pol-
icy the United States has follow-
ed for the past thirty years.

Dartmouth Edges Golfers;
Lee Wins For Generals, 5-4

By JUD REIS
Assistant Sports Editor

The Dartmouth golf team drop-
ped W&L 6-3 in the Generals’ op-
ening match last Saturday.

The scoring used was match play,
with each winning individual
awarded one point, and the team
with the best ball in each foursome
getting one point. The match was
close with Dartmouth winning only
after the seventeenth hole of the
last foursome.

In the first foursome Jack Varda-
man and Grantham Couch of W&L
each tied their Dartmouth oppon-
ents. The best ball for this foursome
was also even. Playing No. 3 for
the Generals Ronnie Stewart lost to
Payne of Dartmouth 7 and 6, but
Will Lee beat Dartmouth’s Linck
5 and 4. The best ball was halved so
the score stood 3-3 after two four-
somes had completed play.

In the final foursome Lukart
of Dartmouth beat Steve Henry 2
and 1. Warren Hughes lost by an
identical score to Dartmouth’s
Gregory. W&L lost the best ball
one up, and Dartmouth had the
match 6-3.

The Generals’ next match will be
the Hot Springs Invitational during
the last week-end of Spring vaca-
tion. For this tournament W&L will
host Colgate, U. Va., and Carnegie
Tech. Coach Twombly will use the
same men as in the Dartmouth
match except Paul McBride will be
playing in place of Grantham Couch.

Christian Declines To Run
(Continued from page 1)

Dave Peters, president of Sigma
Nu, believes that because of Chris-
tian’s dropping out of the picture,
Ireland is almost sure to get the top
office. If Christian had run, it would
have been pretty tough competition.

Charlie Commander of the Uni-
versity party stated that “If Chris-
tian feels that strongly about not
running, I think he has a right to
drop from the race.”

The results of Christian’s an-
nouncement not to run will have
far reaching consequences on the
Washington and Lee political scene.
However, in view of last year’s elec-
tion, it is difficult to draw any im-
mediate conclusions.

McFall Won’t Run For Minks Presidency

The Friday edition learned today
that Don McFall, SAE rising junior,
who had been mentioned as the
leading University Party candidate
for president of the Mongolian
Minks, will not run in the forth-
coming Mink elections.

McFall, who was far ahead of all
other candidates in a sample poll
conducted by this newspaper, stat-
ed that “the pressures of my other
activities, together with my heavy
academic commitments, will force
me to stay out of the race.”

“T have given a great deal of con-
sideration to the heavy responsibili-
ties of this office,” said McFall, “and
I really feel that I will not be able
to give the Minks the leadership
they deserve. We have had wonder-
ful relations with the faculty and I
do not feel that I will have the time
to keep up our relationship with
them.”

Unexpurgated

would not preclude his serving the
student body in other posts. He stat-
ed: “While I realize that the Mon-
golian Mink president is the most
responsible of all campus officers, I
feel that I may perhaps serve the
student body better in some other
capacities. I may run for the posi-
tion of chaplain of my fraternity, or
perhaps for secretary of Phi Beta
Kappa.”

“I will not, however, be a candi-
date for Dean of Students. I feel
that the Dean of Students should be
either a senior or a law student.
Maybe next year. I might mention,
though, that I am polishing up my
handball game.”

McFall’s announcement has
thrown the campus political situa-
tion into a state of chaotic uncer-
tainty.

University Party chairman Gran-
tham Couch said that “this may well

party. We are trying to persuade
him to run. I personally hope that
he changes his mind for the good
of the University and the good of
the party.”

Other campus political leaders ex-
pressed varying opinions.

Tom Rains, president of the KA
house, said “this comes as a terrible
shock to me. We had expected that
McFall would lead a University
Party sweep of campus elections.
After all, it’s an old saying that as
the Minks go, so goes the Univer-
sity.”

Tony Council, SAE house presi-
dent, told a Friday reporter that
“McFall is the best candidate to
come out of our house in years. We
still can’t believe that he won’t run.
We had been pushing him for ma-
jor offices all along, and now we fin-
ally get him set for the big one, he
dumps on us.”

 

 

chairman, was jubilant. “This is our
chance to get back into power on
campus. If we can persuade Chris-
tian to run for Minks president, we’ll
be golden. I am sure that the Uni-
versity Party’s chances have been
dealt a grave blow by McFall’s de-
cision.”

Bill Lowry, well-known NFU, said
“this merely bears out what we have
been saying in Protest all year. This
campus is deep in the direst depths
of apathy when a man of McFall’s
qualifications will not run for presi-
dent of the Minks. If we ever need
a constitutional convention and a
Ban-on-the-bomb, we need it now.”
Ben Brown, another Protest spokes-
man voiced a like opinion.

Steve Rutledge, assimilation com-
mittee chairman, said: “I am afraid
this will hurt seriously our cam-
paign to make the campus better-
dressed. Both Don Huffman and I

did example for the rest of the
school in matters of fashion.”

Ed Side, Lexington impressario,
stated that McFall’s decision would
hurt the local theatres in their
comeback attempt. Side said that
McFall is the type of man who will
lead the students back into the mov-
ies. “He has greatly helped my busi-
ness this year, and I am sure he
would help it more from such an in-
fluential position.”

An authoritative source at Hollins
said that McFall’s election to the
Mink presidency would help rela-
tions between her school and Wash-
ington and Lee. She said, however,
that she was not surprised that Mc-
Fall was too busy to seek election,
“He’s down here all the time any-
way. We wanted to run him for
president of the Cotollion Club.”

Thorns Craven is president of the
Minks currently.

IFC Petitions Faculty
For Academic Change

Interfraternity Council President Bob Doenges delivered a
student petition to the regular faculty meeting yesterday after-
noon which requests that the faculty make a thorough study
of the possibility of doing away with 8:25 and 12:05 classes,
eliminating all afternoon labs and giving freshmen unlimited

cuts.

Doenges said that a number of
fraternity men had become con-
vinced that freshmen were subject-
ed to too many academic pressures
when they first entered the Univer-
sity and they felt that the fraterni-
ties should “get first crack at the
boys” before they become too in-
volved with their studies.

Doenges said that the fraternity
men behind the petition, who have
asked to remain anonymous, had
asked him to present it to the fac-
ulty. He pointed out that his pre-
sentation of the petition was solely
as IFC president and did not im-
ply that he supported it.

Expects More Signers

The petition bears the signatures
of about 25 per cent of the student
body but Doenges said he expected
nearly all the students to sign it by
the end of Spring vacation.

In other business, the faculty, act-
ing on complaints from townspeople
that students were staying up too
late, decided to do away with final
exams and limit hour quizzes in
each course to one per semester.

Also, the new Faculty Control
Committee, suspended one professor
for giving pop quizzes and campused
three others for “conduct which
aroused the concern of authorities
at the Travellers’ Club.”

Five professors have lost their
Glenn Grants for failing to give a
2.00 overall average in the courses
they teach.

University President Fred C. Cole
said that the moves were taken on
the faculty’s own initiative, and not
because of pressure from the stu-
dents.

SCC Knocks Dancing In Public

The Student Control Committee in a recent policy meeting voiced its
disapproval at the growing number of reported incidents of public dancing
on the part of Washington and Lee students.

It is felt by the committee that such action not only places a student
in a position of possible involvement with The Saturday Review of Litera-
ture, but that it also leaves a poor impression with the members of the
community and with visiting high school tours.

In the future, students engaged in public dancing will be campused.

In reaching the decision to halt such conduct on the part of students,
the Committee expressed its hope that fraternities will replace combo

‘The Shape of Pidenes! Is Dr. Voyeur’s Topic

“The Shape of Desdemona” by
Professor Milton Voyeur of Benn-
ington College will be the topic of
the annual Pre-Med-White Friar
Convocation on April 1. Dr. Voyeur,
in “Othello! A Good Fellow,” de-
scribed Desdamona’s shape as
“nice.”

Professor Voyeur is an outstand-
ing scholar in the field of English
literature, who has edited the de-
finitive bibliography of erotic litera-
ture of the sixteenth century.

A native of New Guinea, Profes-
sor Voyeur received his A.B. de-
gree at Madison College, and his
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Rad-
cliffe. He was awarded an honorary
doctorate by Washington and Lee in
1943.

Dr. Voyeur has been a Professor
of English at Bennington since 1956.

He was awarded a Mansfield-Har-

 

 

gitay fellowship for advanced study
at Sweet Briar and has also studied
under a BB grant at the Sorbonne.

He was a Hefner reader in contem- |
porary literature at Playboy maga-|
zine in 1954, and was associate edi-|
tor of the scholarly journal, Gem, |

last summer.

 

 

 

 

Dr. Voyeur is the author of “Form

“We had originally tried to get

Valentine’s band includes piano
player Hank Holman, bassist Pep
Wilson, and drummer Jim Frog.

When Valentine formed his group
he picked up Holman from the Par-
ry McClure marching band, and
Wilson from the VMI Commanders
Frog had never played drums until
a month ago but so impressed an
audience at the SPE fraternity house
during a recent combo party with
his performance at intermission that
Valentine, always on the look for
new talent, signed him up immedi-
atly.

Professor Stewart

Bill Atwell’s article on this page today, which points out
some of Professor Robert Stewart’s accomplishments as a com-
poser, reminds us how fortunate we are to have a man of Mr.
Stewart’s talent as musical director at Washington and Lee.
We are very proud of what he is doing in his own right and
as a gifted teacher of the musical ignoramuses that a good
many of us unfortunately were before we came here.

 

Random Notes On PE:
Muscular Christianity?

By TRACY HARRINGTON

To the incoming freshman, Wash-
ington and Lee promises a myriad
of wonderful things. Chiefly, though,
it proports to produce gentlemen—
and that, after all, is what the world
really needs to solve its problems.

Three areas of endeavor are in-
volved in the metamorphosis of the
awkward, unkempt freshmen into
the suave, studly Washington and
Lee man. Two of these are the train-
ing of the young minds in matters
intellectual (the University courses)
and matters social (the Greek letter
fraternities). The third realm in the
education of a gentleman is the one
which I shall pursue today—the de-
velopment of the body, accomplished
by the two year course in physical
education.

After the initial introduction to
campus life via freshman camp and
and Rush Week, followed by the
awesome attendance for the first
time at real college lectures, the
novice student discovers, to his
horrible dismay, Doremus Gym-
nasium; he will come to associate
it with smelly people, screaming
sadists, and sick feelings in the pit of
his stomach.

Terrorizing Tests

The gym curriculum calls first for
a series of tests to discover just how
miserably weak are America’s gen-
eration of weaklings. These “tests”
are enough to terrorize the most
biceped beast of them all.

Initially, the freshman must pass
the swimming test. That in itself is
bad enough—even though everyone
knows that a gentleman must be
able to swim 16 laps of a standard-
ized pool. The really frightening
thing is the manner in which the
pool is entered. The nude, shiver-
ing bodies of thirty-odd freshmen
are herded up to the second story
of the gymnasium. A few gasps are
heard, and a few shieks of terror
echo over the balcony and down—
impossibly down—to the swimming
pool. The realization comes that
they actually intend for you to jump
off into what looks like a rectangu-
lar postage stamp. But like true gen-
tlemen all, the freshmen close their
eyes, protect themselves as best they
can, and jump.

Muscular Christianity

The remainder of the tests in-
volve balancing on your head, sit-
ups, push-ups, duck walks, and THE
MILE. Except for the few fleet-
footeds (whom, by the way, every-
body else hates), the freshmen crawl
from the gym heaving, moaning,
and cursing the originators of Mus-
cular Christianity.

Eventually the testing is over, and
the real fun begins. (Some unfortu-
nates never quite make the mile or
the swimming test, however. Rumor
has it that there are seniors who
have unsuccessfully run and swum
their way tortuously through four
years in an attempt to pass their
gym requirement.)

For the first semester, freshmen
hit golf balls, turn cartwheels,
climb ropes, wrestle, and play soc-
cer. Many sports taught at Wash-
ington and Lee seem to have sev-
eral unique features: All of them
can be played when you're 90, all
of them tend to emphasize how un-

coordinated you are, and most of
them require outside participation
(sort of like parallel reading in
P.E.) at one or another of Lexing-
ton’s athletic establishments.

The most memorable activity in
the first semester is what is inno-
cently referred to as “tumbling.”
The cartwheels, standing on the
head, and turning somersaults
aren’t so bad. It’s the rope climb
that really gets you. About half way
up the thing, your arms give out.
You look down, and far below, you
see the hard, hard floor and the
smiling face of the gym teacher.
Then to scream, slide down the
rope, burn your hands, and get a D
for effort.

The second half of the year begins
while freshmen are engaged in ac-
tivities of another realm of their
gentlemanly training. This is the
culmination of the fraternity pledge
program, politely and farcically re-
ferred to as Help Week. Gym in-
structors seem to choose this par-
ticular week to emphasize calis-
thenics.

As far as formal sports are con-
cerned, the agenda calls for hand-
ball, bowling, volleyball, table ten-
nis, and tennis during the spring
semester. Handball and bowling are
tolerable—of course, the majority
of the freshmen aren’t quite sure
what they are doing, but since this
is not a new experience, they aren’t
upset by their ignorance and manage
to avoid killing each other with
handballs or bowling balls.

The Gym, Chamber of Horrors

The greatest game is volleyball.
Before freshmen are allowed to
participate in the intricacies of the
game, they gather in circles of seven
or eight people and throw the volley
ball back and forth. Some particu-
larly agile fellows do pretty well at
this—others stand frozen with em-
barrassment and let the ball bounce
off their heads rather than maket
even bigger fools of themselves. A
chance visitor to Doremus Gymnas-
ium (although why anybody would
by chance or otherwise enter its
chamber of horrors is beyond me),
would probably think he had hap-
pened into a rehabilitation center for
the physically afflicted.

The period of instruction is fol-
lowed by a few futile weeks of play-
ing volleyball itself. Occasionally,
someone forgets where he is, catches
himself having a good time, and then
blushes for fear someone else might
notice.

And so goes the physical train-
ing of the young gentleman....
Each of those who have gone
through it will forever have a spe-
cial feeling for such phrases as
“line up for cal,” “take five laps,”
and “dress out.” It’s just another
part—a dear and meaningful one—
of our education, and let us all cher-
ish with our sheepskins those vital
little straps of elasticity which sym-
bolize the precious hours spent in
Doremus Gymnasium pursuing gen-
tlemanliness.

 

NOTICE

The “Sabres,” a newly organized
combo composed entirely of W&L
freshmen will play in the Com-

 

mons from 6-7 Friday night.

By BILL ATWELL

Associate Professor of Fine Arts
and Director of Music at Washing-
ton and Lee Robert Stewart will
have three compositions played at
the Roanoke Fine Arts Festival
May 2. This festival, the only one of
its kind in the state, is unique in
that it is devoted entirely to “new
music.” It is sponsored by the Roan-
oke Fine Arts Center and this year
is under the direction of W&L al-
umnus Benno Foreman. Aside from
Mr. Stewart’s pieces, the compo-
sitions of David Davis, Sydney Hod-
kinson, and John Diercks will be
featured.

Stewart’s New York Performance

Stewart has had a busy year al-
ready. In mid-March he had a New
York performance of his Three
Pieces for Woodwind Quintet. Earl-
ier in the year he had works played
at the Birmingham Arts Festival
and the Roanoke Symphony played
his Prelude for Strings. Recently he
has had two more honors bestowed
upon him. The Conservatory of

 

Puerto Rico has asked permission to
include two of his pieces for wood-
winds in its library. They will be
played sometime next year. In ad-
dition, he has been selected by the
Southeastern Composers’ League to
have compositions played at the
University of Alabama Symposium
of Contemporary Music.

Stewart’s pieces to be played at
the Roanoke Festival include Trio
No. 2 for Violin, Cello, and Piano,
Canzona, and Divertissement. The
Canzona and Divertissement were
written especially for the John
A. Graham Brass Choir and will be
performed by it. Of special interest
in the Divertissement is the use of
improvisitory dialogues between the
two trumpets. Stewart said, “This
is an attempt to put some of the
musical creativity and interpreta-
tion back in the hands of the per-
formers.” The piece was first per-
formed in March on WDBJ-TV in
Roanoke.

The other three composers are, as
Mr. Stewart, members of the South-
eastern Composers’ League and mu-

sic instructors at Virginia colleges.
Mr. Davis is at present Director
of the Glee Club at the University
of Virginia. He had a New York
performance of his Changes and Cy-
cles in February of this year as part
of the Music of Our Time series.

His Pieces to be played in Roan-
oke are Seven Poems of Basho, a
vocal solo for soprano which will
be performed by his wife, and a
Conversation Piece. The latter will
be out of a jazz idiom complete with
improvisation developed from a
small group including keyboard,
percussion, and flugelhorn.

U. Va. Band Director

Hodkinson is also from the Uni-
versity of Virginia. He is a profes-
sor of music and director of the
U.Va. band. He recently had a per-
formance of his compositions by
the New York Percussion Group.
He, too, has been selected by the
Southeastern Composers’ League for
a performance at the University of
Alabama Symposium of Contempo-
rary Music.

 

Stewart’s Compositions Will Be Presented
This Spring In Roanoke Fine Arts Festival

In Roanoke his Drawings, Set No.
3 for Clarinet and Percussion will
be played along with Study for
Magnetic Tape. The latter is an ex-
cursion into the field of electronic
music. It will be the first time a
performance of this type has been
given in Virginia.

The final composer on the program
will be John Diercks, director of
music at Hollins College. In the past
year he has had a performance at
the Birmingham Festival and at the
University of Mississippi.

Dierck’s Suite for Flute and Pi-
ano and Mirror of Brass will be per-
formed in Roanoke. The Washington
and Lee Brass Choir will be on hand
to play the latter.

The Festival itself is an attempt,
according to Stewart, to stimulate
interest in contemporary music here
in Virginia. It is hoped that anyone
interested will attend the show,
scheduled for May 2nd. We are in-
deed fortunate to have such gifted
composers in the area and it would
be well worth anyone’s while to
listen to what they have to offer.

Fraternities Overshadow
Individuals In Politics

By HOWARD SLATER

As was somewhat reluctantly but
necessarilly pointed out last week,
my editor and I sometimes do not
agree. To be more precise, we al-
most invariably disagree; and it is
certainly potent proof of his dedica-
tion to open-mindedness, as well as
more personal values, such as re-
straint, perserverance, and stamina,
that he continues to print this col-
ucn,

Several weeks ago, he man-
aged to extract some gentle revenge
from my natural tendency to get
my feet caught up in my mouth, by
quoting me, supposedly excathedra,
as chairman of one of the less than
distinguished political parties which
plague the student body. My state-
ment at that time was: “I may be re-
membered as the most idealistic,
naive, and unsuccessful party chair-
man in years.” This came in answer
to my beloved editor’s question
about some specifics of our political
situation.

The interesting thing is that the
word “unsuccessful” somehow didn’t
get printed with the rest of the
quote. Looking back, it seems as if
that was a significant mistake, be-
cause idealism, naivete, and lack of
success go hand in hand, at least
insofar as they apply on our cam-
pus-cosmos. What I am. saying,
therefore, is not that I may be an
unsuccessful party chairman be-
cause the opposition part may (and
probably will) sweep the coming
elections. I will be unsuccessful in
politics as a member of the student

_| body. We are all in this together.

And the pot we’re in needs a good
cleaning!
The Fraternities

The basis of our political system
is the fraternity, and not the in-
dividual candidate. Candidates are
chosen—at least in part, and or-
dinarily—as representatives of their

 

houses. The same principle applies
in other extra-curricular affairs,
whether some foolish people are
willing to admit it or not. The only
point to be debated, apparently, is
whether it is socially good form to
say so publicly. The principle that
houses stand or fall on the for-
tunes of politics also may be de-
bated. I do not think that this is so.

Nevertheless, this is the common
belief, which gives rise to the com-
munity approach to politics here;
and this gives rise to a situation in
which we all are destined to fail.
For where is ability, where is re-
sponsibility, and where is concern
for the represented, in this scheme
of things? Obviously, nowhere—nor
do they deserve to be, because if
student officials are not able, if they
are not responsible, and if they do
not care to know what the elec-
torate thinks and wants (and this

Phi Psi’s Defeat Delts
To Become Mat Champs

Phi Kappa Psi captured the 1962
Intra-mural wrestling champion-
ship this week by defeating Delta
Tau Delta 19-11.

Phi Psi moved into an early lead
when Peter Alford, wrestling in the
123-pound slot, outpointed the
Delts’ Gordon Gay.

The winners were forced to for-
feit in the 130-pound class. Then
Tom Andrews came up with a 9-7
win over Rick Erickson to move
the Delts into the lead.

Brack Dew scored the Delts last
points by taking down Spence Stou-
fer.

The Phi Psi’s got strong perform-
ance in all the heavy weight clas-
ses to win.

Jim Wearn and Tom Clements
both won, and Mike Harris pinned
Dud Warwick in one of the best
I-M matches of the year.

Wayne Bradshaw, undefeated for
four years in I-M wrestling, pinned
Wig Wiggins in the unlimited divis-
ion to put away the win for the Phi
Psi’s.

Slater Says That Majority of Students Don’t Care

(Continued from page 2)

is too often the case) then this is
so because the electorate itself does
not care!

Who Cares?

Can anyone claim that the ma-
jority of students do care—when
they insist on revering some
sacrosanct list of a candidate’s ac-
tivities, commonly called his “qual-
ifications,” but which usually have
no bearing on him or the elected
office he is to fill? when they insist
on neglecting almost entirely what a
man ‘stands for’ or how he intends
to approach basic issues? and when
they insist rigidly on adhering to
very real, almost tangible, party
lines, except in special instances
when they’ll switch for the sake of
a man with personality, revealing
that it really is coolness and not
thoughtfulness which is valued in a
student leader?

For these reasons we are destined

to be failures once again in the
petty game of politics. What hap-
pened last year was quite literal-
ly a good thing, because the stu-
dent body didn’t accept complacent-
ly whatever the two political part-
ies decreed for it. If it were to do so
again, or if the parties were to rise
above their selfishness and mediocre
practices, we might have cause for
hope. But even I am not so idealis-
tic and naive as to put much faith
in that cheerful possibility.

TILL WE MEET AGAIN

Seven years now I have been writing this column for the
makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and each year when I come to
the last column of the year, my heart is gripped by the same
bittersweet feeling. I shall miss you sorely, dear readers, in the
long summer days ahead. I shall miss all you freckle-faced
boys with frogs in your pockets. I shall miss all you pig-tailed
girls with your gap-toothed giggles. I shall miss you one and
all—your shining morning faces, your apples, your marbles,
your jacks, your little oilcloth satchels.

But I shall not be entirely sad, for you have given me many
a happy memory to sustain me. It has been a rare pleasure
writing this column for you all year, and I would ask every
one of you to come visit me during the summer except there is
no access to my room. The makers of Marlboro Cigarettes,
after I missed several deadlines, walled me in. All I have is
a mail slot into which I drop my columns and through which
they supply me with Marlboro Cigarettes and such food as
will slip through a mail slot. (For six months now I have been
living on after-dinner mints.)

 

Grits Tine he ts Ha deel 5

I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have not walled me in. They could never do such a cruel thing.
Manly and muscular they may be, and gruff and curt and direct,
but underneath they are men of great heart and sweet, com-
passionate disposition, and I wish to take this opportunity to
state publicly that I will always have the highest regard for
the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, no matter how my lawsuit
for back wages comes out.

I am only having my little joke. I am not suing the makers
of Marlboros for back wages. These honorable gentlemen have
always paid me promptly and in full. To be sure, they have not
paid me in cash, but they have given me something far more
precious. You would go far to find one so covered with tattoos as I.

I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have not covered me with tattoos. In fact, they have engraved
no commercial advertising whatsoever on my person. My suit,
of course, is another matter, but even here they have exercised
taste and restraint. On the back of my suit, in unobtrusive
neon, they have put this fetching little jingle:

Are your taste buds out of kilter?

Are you bored with smoking, neighbor?
Then try that splendid Marlboro filter,
Try that excellent Marlboro fleighbor!

On the front of my suit, in muted phosphorus, are pictures of
the members of the Marlboro board and their families. On my
hat is a small cigarette girl crying, ““Who’ll buy my Marlboros?”

I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have been perfect dolls to work for, and so, dear readers, have
you. Your kind response to my nonsense has warmed this old
thorax, and I trust you will not find me soggy if in this final
column of the year, I express my sincere gratitude.

Have a good summer. Stay healthy. Stay happy. Stay loose.

The makers of Marlboros and the new unfiltered king-size
Philip Morris Commander have been happy to bring you
this uncensored, free-wheeling column all year long. Now, if
we may echo old Max: Stay healthy. Stay happy. Stay loose.

Bowers Speaks
On Soliloquy

Dr. Fredson T. Bowers told a
Washington and Lee University au-
dience yesterday that playwright
“William Shakespeare knew his au-
dience and how to take care of their
various points of view and reactions.”

In a discussion of the “Shape of
Hamlet,” the head of the English
department of the University of
Virginia analyzed a 12-line solilo-
quy from Act Three, Scene Two of
the famous Shakespearean play.
He said that Shakespeare used this
short speech to direct audience re-
action in the following climatic
scenes.

Although seemingly an unpromis-
ing speech, it sums up Hamlet’s res-
olution, while showing his cautious
plan of procedure as he deals with*
his mother, the wife of the brother
and murderer of Hamlet’s father.

Shakespeare, Bowers said, stepped
out of normal dramatic usage in the
speech as he frankly and openly di-
rected audience reaction. This indi-
cates the great importance of the
12 lines, and the fact that the author
meant them to forecast much of
the coming action.

In the soliloquy Hamlet reveals
the attitudes that lead him to suc-

 

Dr. Bowers

cessful revenge while taking his own
life. Bowers said that Hamlet’s two
tasks, to cause his mother to repent
of her incest, and to repay the
murderer of his father, were carried
out successfully. He called the for-
mer of the tasks the one which had
to be done first.

Dr. Bowers, widely known for his
work in the field of bibliography,
was the guest speaker in Lee Chapel
for the traditional Washington and
Lee Phi Beta Kappa convocation.
Fourteen students and an alumnus
were tapped for membership in the
Gamma of Virginia chapter of the
national honorary scholastic society
in ceremonies later Thursday. The
annual convocation also marked the
166th anniversary of George Wash-
ington’s $50,000 gift to the univer-
sity’s endowment.

14th Annual Tucker Lectures
Orison Marden Will Deliver

The president of the Association
of the Bar of the City of New York
will deliver the 14th annual John
Randolph Tucker Lectures in Law at
Washington and Lee University on
May 4 and 5.

Orison S. Marden, a member of
the law firm of White & Case, will
speak at 8 p.m. Friday (May 4) and
12 noon Saturday (May 5) in the
university’s Lee Chapel, according to
Law School Dean Charles P. Light,
Jr. No title has been listed for the
lectures.

The public lectures will coincide
with Washington and Lee’s alumni
reunion program for the classes of
1912, 1922, 1937 and 1952. Both law
and academic graduates are expected
to attend the lectures along with
non-alumni attorneys and law stu-
dents from other institutions. Large

Glee Club Gets

Music Room

Washington and Lee’s Glee Club
has finally found a home in a new
music activity room in the basement
of the Student Union.

The Glee Club, which will share
the new room with the John A.
Graham Brass Choir and various
student combos and music groups,
held its first rehearsal in “its own”
room last night.

 

The new room is equipped with
a sound absorbing ceiling, large bul-
letin board “baffles” which absorb
sound on the sides, and new curtains
which cover the back wall and win-
dows to capture the sound.

New permanent risers have been
added for seating the club during
rehearsal. There are large cabinets
for music and a special closet for
storing instruments.

 

numbers of the Washington and Lee
Law School Association also will be
present.

The Tucker Lectures were estab-
lished in 1949 as a part of Washing-
ton and Lee’s bicentennial celebra-
tion They honor the memory of John
Randolph Tucker’s service to the
university as dean of the Law
School. The late John W. Davis, an
alumnus, nationally known attorney
and the 1924 Democratic candidate
for President, delivered the first
Tucker Lectures.

Last year’s lecturer was Judge E.
Barrett Prettyman, circuit judge of
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.

Other judges, attorneys and edu-
cators who have participated in the
series are Judge Arthur T. Vander-
bilt, Judge John J. Parker, John
Lord O’Brian, Judge Joseph C. Hut-
cheson, Jr., Judge Harold R. Medina,
Dean Robert G. Storey, William T.
Grossett, Dean Frederick Deane
Goodwin Ribble, John J. McCloy,
Whitney N. Seymour and Ross L.
Malone.

Marden received his LL.B. degree
from New York University in 1929
and became a partner in White &
Case law firm in 1946. He has been
recognized for his work as chair-
man of the National Council on,
Legal Clinics, a project of the Na-|
tional Legal Aid and Defender As-
sociation in cooperation with the)
American Bar Association and the
Association of American Law
Schools.

Steel: Is John F. Kennedy Out Of Bounds.

By ROSEWELL PAGE

When USS. Steel announced its $6
per ton price hike and when six
of the twelve major steel producers
in the nation (the top twelve con-
trol over 65 per cent of the steel
market) the White House let it be
known through what the Wall Street
Journal has termed “an _ inspired
leak” that the president was “in-
furiated” and that he was having
the Justice Department “investi-
gate” the matter.

As the week progressed and other
steel companies followed the leader
other investigations were announced.
Representative Celler, chairman of
the House Judicial Committee an-
nounced an investigation, and in the
Senate Kefauver joined the pack in
declaring that his committee would
hold an additional hearing which
will simply be another in a series |
of such investigations that the steel |
industry has undergone since World |
War Il. And finally on Thursday |
the other Kennedy proclaimed that |
he is ordering a grand jury inves- |
tigation into the new round of steel |
price increases.

First of all, what are the objectives |

 

of these hearings? In an interview

with Dr. Charles Phillips of the
W&L economics department, we
learned that the previous investi-

gations of the steel industry by
legislative committees have been
fruitless. The committees have been
witch hunting in the steel industry
five times since World War II. (It is
interesting to note that each inves-
tigation cost the government thous-
ands, and that someone might make
the rediculous suggestion that Celler
and Kefauver hold a joint hearing).
In each case, they have gathered
reams of information, stirred public
opinion to a fever and then retired
from the field. Just what these two
legislative investigating committees
intend to prove is beyond the writers
comprehension.

Under the present anti-trust laws,
which Dr. Phillips suggests do not
appear to have been violated by
the steel price hike, the Justice De-
partment must prove collusion
among the major steel companies to
raise prices, beeause the price
leadership which U.S. Steel Corpor-
ation is alleged to have practiced has
never been considered illegal by the

 

courts. So we see that brother Bob
Kennedy also has his work cut out
for him.

In answer to our question concern-
ing the mixture of economic policy
and political pressure which the
present administration has employed
Dr. Phillips made the following
comment:

First, with reference to the sharp-
est stock price slump in the past
six months which informed sources
believe to be a direct result of the
steel price controversy, he noted
that the president’s action in this
case confirms businesses’ previous
suspicion thathe is anti-business.
He added that his implications that
some price controls may be needed
has not made the big investor happy.

When questioned as to whether or
not he foresaw any immediate action
with regard to price controls, Dr.
Phillips replied that he did not be-
lieve that the present Congress
would pass any “price control” bill
other than a price reporting bill
which would require that certain
large firms in certain highly con-
centrated industries report intended

 

price hikes thirty days in advance.

was the sun.

After two straight drizzly days, the sun peeked through
cloudy skies early this morning, making things seem almost

like Spring, even if the temperatures*
were unseasonally low.

But regardless of coolish thermom-
eter readings, damp grounds, and an
unnatural lack of party spirit evi-
dent during this post-vacation week,
nearly two thousand students and
dates were likely to shop up at the
Mayflower this afternoon for the
annual Spring cocktail party, given
this year by the Beta’s in honor of
dance set president Charlie McCord.

By the time the cocktail party
was over, spirits considerably higher,

 

 

and things were indeed more na-
tural around the university.

Wells, Bibb

This is an unusual week-end for
Washington and Lee; and most stu-
dents are approaching it with skepti-
cal outlooks.

For the first time in years, there
will be no dance, either formal or
informal, during the weekend.

Instead, dance board president
Steve Galef has substituted two folk
music concerts, one scheduled for
Friday and one Saturday night.

Tonight’s entertainment gets un-
derway at 8, when Meg Welles and
Leon Bibb hold a joint concert in
Doremus Gymnasium.

On Saturday, Dave Guard and his
Whiskeyhill Singers move into Do-
remus for another concert, also
scheduled from 8-10 p.m.

All three groups are making their
first college appearance in the South,
and large crowds are expected; es-
pecially since IFC rules prohibiting
house combo parties from beginning
until the end of the concert will be
in effect.

For this, the first folk music week-
end in W&L history, Galef has ar-
ranged special facilities in the gym,
including new walkout stages and
special staging effects.

weekend in W&L history, Galef has

Performers Praised

The excellence of Welles, Bibb,
and Guard as entertainers is widely
known. All three have new records
for major recording firms coming out
before summer, and are greatly in
demand by college booking agencies
throughout the United States.

A New York Times critic recently
called Miss Welles “the brightest
talent in folk music today, better
than Odetta or Joan Baez.” And the
San Francisco Chronicle called Bibb
“the most dynamic new performer in
entertainment.”

Guard, who was the brains of
the Kingston Trio for five years,
recently quit the Trio to form his
own group because he wanted to
do more authentic folk music. In
the process, he added a girl singer
and two of the foremost string in-
strumentalists in America, and called
them the Whiskeyhill Singers.

After only two months of regular
performances, the Whiskeyhill Sing-
ers have received widspread acclaim,
including a feature article in Life
magazine, which called them “per-
haps the best of all the folk singing

 

Dr. Phillips added that “the prob-
lem which President Kennedy faces
is not a new one. We have had con-
tinuous inflation since the end of
World War II and the Federal gov-
ernment has either been unwilling
or unable to balance the budget.
Thus, in order to try to control in-
flation the Executive has placed
pressure on certain industries to
keep prices down.”

“This mixed system of self deter-
mination for management and the
application of detailed political pres-
sure has not worked,” Phillips said.

“Tf the President can get manage-
ment and labor together before ne-
gotiations break down, fine! But
either management must make the
final decision concerning its price
policies or it must not.”

Phillips emphasized the point that
the time has come for the U.S. to
make a decision on exactly what
type of economic system it wants
and then to adopt the proper means
to achieve it.

“If we are to have an economic
system based on the principle of
workable competition,’ he — said,

“management must have the right to | adopt the means to achieve the final

 

make its own decisions.”

“Tf Blough is right in his conten-
tion that steel needs the price hike
in order to revitalize and modernize
the industry to compete with foreign
producers, the president is wrong;
and if Blough bows to the President’s
will, who is to suffer? Certainly not
the president: rather, it would be
the American economy in general
and the steel industry in particular.

“The problem with Presidential
threats and pleadings,” Phillips said,
“is that they deal with the ends
and not the means.”

“Tf we really want to control infla-
tion, then we ought to be willing to
take measures to control inflation.”
(Le., proper monetary and _ fiscal
policy).

He said that if we feel big business
is too big, we ought to take steps to
break up the big firms in the highly
concentrated industries; or if labor
unions are so powerful that they are
a threat to our competitive economic
system, then we ought to deal with |
them directly. His point is, and we|
believe it is a good one, that we
must decide on what we want and

 

duos, trios, or quartets.”

result and discontinue a sufficient-
unto-the-day, hit and miss policy
with regard to unions, business, and
our economic system in general.

Dr. Phillips would make no com-
ment on whether or not the Blough
defense of the steel price hike was
justified, although he doubted that
the price increase would be of sub-
stantial worth in increasing the in-
dustry’s profits, emphasizing that
it was Blough’s decision to make.

In general, we feel that Mr. Ken-
nedy’s implication that the price rise
is an act lese majestic, a crime of
insubordination against the sovereign,
in short, the refusal of the indispen-
sable segment of our free economy to
live up to his own ideas and ex-
pectations of how the steel industry
ought to be organized, is an an un-
fortunate one and we agree with
the editor of the Wall Street Jour-
nal when he says:

“What ought to infuriate the coun-
try is their attempt to pillory one
private company for the consequence
of past public power. And this ar-
rogant idea that the price of steel,
or any other commodity, ought to
be what the President says it is.”

Friday Edition

 

Kennedy Versus Steel Industry

Student Body President Uncas McThenia’s letter to the
editor, which is published below, should prove one of the earlier
shots in what promises to be a hot national debate over the
relationship between Mr. Kennedy’s government and the steel

industry.

Liberal comments have ranged from violent rage to delight
at a chance to crack down on Big Business. Conservatives have
deep fears that excessive Executive and Congressional reaction
to the price raise in steel will push this country farther toward
socialism. One W&L professor said this “may well mean the
beginning of the end for capitalism.”

The Ring-tum Phi will take an active interest in the debate,

for we believe that it will be one of great importance for the
future of this country. To clear up the issues, a panel discus-
sion, under Ring-tum Phi sponsorship is tentatively scheduled
for next Thursday. Professors Phillips and Gunn of the eco-
nomics department have consented to participate in the panel.
Other panelists will be named later.

Changes In The Constitution

The Executive Committee will submit their draft of a new
student government constitution to the student body next week.
The principal changes deal with the method of nominating
candidates for student body offices and with the heads of the
dance sets. They have already been adequately covered in the
Ring-tum Phi. We said before that we favored the changes that
the EC will propose. They represent, in our minds, substantial
improvements over the present system.

Northern Doctor Defends
Social Structure of South

March 22, 1961
To the Editor:

Mr. Jack Atwell (R-T P, March
13) perhaps is unaware that the
Soviets have been posing for a long
time as fighters against bias and
discrimination, but the record stands
against them. Z. Dobbs’ Red Intrigue
and Race Turmoil is available for
study, reflection and argumentation.
Occasionally, even newspapers print
accounts of the biased treatment of
Negroes in the U.S.S.R. (I am not
referring to the propaganda red
carpet treatment given to Robeson,
ete.). Mention of the Soviet treat-
ment of minorities (e.g. Hungarians)
should disarm any opponent. (I will
omit mention of other episodes.)

Lately we are beginning to hear
more of anti-semitism in Russia. To
obtain information, one might well
start with Karl Marx’s A World
Without Jews. A more scholarly
presentation is Edmund Silberner’s
The Anti-Semitic Tradition in Mod-
ern Socialism (Hebrew U., Jerusa-
lem, 1956).

With regard to the “Freedom
Riders,” one might glance at the
Congressional Record of May 25,
1961, wherein some of the associa-
tions of several directors of C.O.R.E.
are described. I particularly draw
attention to pages 8351 to 8362,
wherein are described the individual
directors’ associations. These find-
ings have been published in some
newspapers (not in the North—to
my knowledge) and in Human
Events.

I am truly sorry to read that a
graduate of W&L considers the
South “so backward and its intel-
lectuals so passive.” This would
seem to reveal a lack of knowledge
of the South’s role in American lit-
erature and its many contributions
to the conservative political cause.
Even our own Chicago Tribune has
the greatest respect and admiration

 

for men like Senators Byrd, Mc-
Clellan, Thurmond (just to mention

| three).

With regard to integration, an
awareness of the double standard
and the geographic segregation of
the North should caution us to be
wary of pointing the finger of guilt
at others.

Sincerely,

EDWARD PALMER, M.D.

Steel Action Is Labelled
‘Political Demogoguery’

To the Editor:

It has been a long time since
such political demogoguery as evi-
denced Wednesday at the presiden-
tial news conference has been ob-
served in the White House. The
New Frontier has not only taken
on the myriad responsibilities norm-
ally delegated to government, but
has also assumed the position of
opera director and majority stock-
holder of U.S. Steel.

Whether the announced price rise
in steel is advisable is a matter of
some debate. Whether it is justified
should be determined on the market
place.

Evidently the President would
make the steel industry his whipping
boy by saying that a small group
is administering prices in disregard
of 180 million Americans. If this is
true, is it so much worse than hav-
ing the President himself declare
what the price of steel should be.

It is apparent that Mr. Kennedy
has been caught in a political mouse-
trap. It was only last week that
Vice President Johnson extolled the
“new dimension” in collective bar-
gaining developed by the New Fron-
tier. This meddling “new dimension”
which runs the gamut from the
Metropolitan Opera to the steel in-
dustry has blown up in his face and
the President cannot enjoy the po-
litical advantage hoped for.

Washington and Lee is a school of
symbols. The colonnade, Lee Chapel,
“old George,” and Goshen are per-
haps most often mentioned and most
popular.

There’s another symbol, not as
old as the colonnade, but just as
representative in its own way of
student life at W&L—the combo.
For the most part, these are small
rock ’n’ roll bands—usually Negro—
who play professionally at colleges
up and down the Eastern Seaboard.

But now Washington and Lee has
its own combo. It’s called the Sabers,
and is made up of six freshmen
with a yen and a talent for making
good popular music.

Blaine Brownell and Bill Ingles,
who both do wonders with their
electric guitars, got together around
the first of March and decided that
what this school needed was a good
student combo—so they formed one.
Freshmen Mike McCord, Jay Fiedler,
Baird Grimson, and Jim Jennings
joined Brownell and Ingles. One day
Hunter Manson, Phi Gam junior,
listened to the group and then be-
came their business manager. They
had everything they needed—except
an engagement to play.

It wasn’t long before they got their
chance. Towards the end of March,
the Lexington Country Club signed
them to play. Evidently the Sabers
made a hit there. When they started

The irony of objective education
is that it creates a questioning frame
of mind which often promotes criti-
cism of the very system that has
produced it. This is a classic ex-
ample of “biting the hand that feeds
you.” Anyone who has _ benefited
from an objective education will in-
variably turn to questioning the
goals and methods of the system of
education within which he labors. It
is essential, therefore, for educators
to publish good solid arguments why
certain educational practices are fol-
lowed, and to state what goals they
seek to reach.

For this reason, it is strange that
no attempt has been made to defend
or apologize for an important fea-
ture of our system of education:
namely, the major requirement. Has
anyone ever heard a really valid
case made for the contention that

 

every student must have a major?

only until midnight), the country-
clubbers passed a hat and talked the
boys into staying an extra hour.
Friday night before Spring Vacation,
they played for a couple of hours in
the Commons.

To Play for Prom

At press time, the Sabers have
planned several future engagements
at the country club, and are signed
to play for the Lexington High
School Senior Prom May 5. On April
26, they will provide music for the
SIPA convention (an annual jour-
nalism meet) here on the campus.
They will play May 11 at St. Anne’s,
a girls’ prep school in Charlottesville
and are scheduled to play this Sat-
urday afternoon at the Kappa Sig
house.

Most of the members of the Sabers
are combo veterans. Brownell sang
with various bands in his home town
of Birmingham, Ala., and has played
the guitar for about a year. Lead
guitarist Ingles has 2 1/2 years com-
bo experience. McCord, who is the
group’s rhythm guitarist and pianist
as well as being one of the vocalists
(along with Brownell and Ingels),
has played in combos for a couple
of years. This makes the fourth year
with the sticks for Saber drummer
Fiedler. Only Grimson and Jennings,
the sax men, are associated with
rock ’n’ roll bands for the first time.

so. Although the major is no doubt
a necessary and desirable guide for
a certain number of students, it is
neither necessary nor desirable for
all. Pre-medical students, for ex-
ample, by the very nature of the
profession which they intend to en-
ter, need to have concentrated and
specialized preparation. But what
kind of special preparation can you
give a pre-law undergraduate?

The mistake, obviously, has been
in assuming that what is good for
the pre-med student is good for the
pre-law student, and what is good
for the student who plans to go on
for a masters and doctorate is good
for the student who is taking over
his father’s business or going into
the army. The trend to specialization
has become an obession, and where

 

 

Professors & Students
Form History Seminar

By BILL ATWELL

This semester, following a type
of program initiated at Washington
and Lee last year, four professors
of history and various history honor
students have been conducting sem-
inars in their chosen field.

The basic purpose of the seminars
according to Dr. Thomas P. Hughes,
is to enable professors and students
to exchange ideas and _ opinions
which might not be done as effec-
tively in other ways.

The history seminar itself de-
veloped out of a practice begun late
in the 19th Century at some of the
finer German universities. One such
institution was the University of
Berlin. The usual procedure was for
professors and graduate students to
meet and discuss the latest historical
books and novels. These seminars
produced some of the greatest teach-
ers of history in that time.

Interpretations of History

There are two basic differences
between the seminars at Washington
and Lee and the older ones. First,
the seminars here are carried on
with undergraduates participating
and, also, the discussions here deal
with older material rather than with
current developments.

Dr. Hughes said that instead of
dealing merely with events in his-
tory, the seminars are concerned
with the men who write history and
the interpretations of these men.
The types of interpretations to be
discussed include “great man” in-
terpretations, economic interpreta-
tions, the more recent psychological
interpretations, and those with so-
ciological emphasis.”

Dr. Hughes added that “in doing
this we realize the historian is not
simply a recorder of facts but is a
person truly engaged in creative
work.”

The people who have taken part in
the two seminars held thus far, aside
from Dr. Hughes, are Dr. C. O.
Smith, Dr. Leon F. Sensabaugh, Mr.
R. W. Kenney, and seniors Bond
Johnson and Jack Vardamann.

The format of the seminar is
simple. An honors student opens
with a brief summary of the view-

 

NOTICE

The ROTC department of Wash-
ington and Lee has announced that

points of one or two leading his-
torians. The student then leads the
discussion in which everyone has a
chance to comment or ask questions.
In one seminar a professor empha-
sized a_ political interpretation
while another was working along the
idea of sociological interpretation.

Food for Thought

A student asked if personal pre-
judice might not have a great deal to
do with how a historian arrives at
his particular interpretation. A dis-
cussion then followed of the ways
in which different environments
might effect every historian.

Obviously, there was considerable
food for thought at this seminar and
according to Dr. Hughes, this has
been true both last year and so far
this year.

“The faculty,” said Hughes, “finds
it interesting to find out the student’s
point of view. We are anxious
to know what the student is looking
for in history and why he is study-
ing it. Sometimes we like to com-
pare his ideas with our own. This
keeps the faculty informed and also
enables the student to learn more
about his teachers and why they are
history teachers.”

This program, it seems to me, can
prove vastly beneficial to the intel-
lectual complexion of the school.
Both the teachers and students in-
volved should be commended for
taking part in a new realm of en-
deavor. Let’s hope that such activi-
ties will continue and perhaps arise
in other courses in the University.

uirement Needed?

there is no reason for it—better still,
where there is outright harm in it—
it is nonetheless maintained.

Up With Whole Men

As Joseph Krutch has said: “Our
modern society requires specialists;
but what it desperately needs is
whole men and women. Down with
the splendid splinter, up with the
whole man.”

What is the reason for our pres-
ence at college? Some of us, no
doubt, are simply marking time, or
else having a good time. But there
are those who take seriously the
opportunity which has been pre-
sented to them. Anyone who does
take this opportunity seriously hopes
that, in the broadest sense, his edu-
cation will make a better man of
him. And the best kind of man that
can be conceived is the whole man,
not the “splendid splinter.”

It is impossible to learn all that
there is to know. It is almost equally

 

impossible to learn all there is to
know about even one field of
knowledge in a short four-year span.
What can be done in four years is
to acquire an introductory know-
ledge of as wide a range of sub-
jects; for it is absurd to assert that
one subject is more valuable than
another and should be concentrated
upon exclusively. No subject is so
worthy, except as it contributes to
the improvement of the individual as
a whole man.

This beginning can be made in
college, and one thing besides: that
is, the promotion of a critical and
objective frame of mind, and the
inculeation of a passionate involve-
ment in education as the key to
becoming a better man. These ob-
jectives, and the ultimate value to
which they all point, soar beyond
and deny the concept of the major
requirement. What then can be of-
fered in its defense?

Alsace Is Now A Well-Integrated Part Of The French Nation

By AL BRODDUS

Strasburg, Mar. 22—No other re-
gion of the world has changed
character any more often than Al-
sace, excepting Lorraine. According
to the current status quo Alsace is
in France, bordered immediately to
the north and east by the German
Federal Republic, to the South by
Switzerland, and to the northwest
by an equally French Lorraine. This
is the region which has brought hav-
oe to elementary history courses for
years. When Bismark attacked the
French in 1870 Alsace became Prus-
sian. She was returned to the French
after the First World War, only to
be incorporated in the Third Riech
two decades later. In 1945 she was
returned to her present position.

There is a touch of irony in all
these alterations, since the Alsatians
themselves, left entirely alone, would
probably lead a happy autonomous

 

existence. This has been impossible
due to the attitude of the French
and Germans, and would probably
not be altogether practical because of
size. Thus the oscillation.

Ethnic Characteristics

What is particularly interesting is
the ethnic result of this singular
history. For the Alsatian is a distinct
ethnic entity. This is particularly
true presently. For while the Al-
satian is a cultural and linguistic
derivative of the German race, at
this moment the distinction between
the two is fairly clear. This is
the result of 17 years of French in-
fluence, the reintroduction of the
beret and the French language. At
times, Alsatians give the objective
observer the impression he is at a
large masquerade party in Munich
of which the theme is “France.”

What makes it necessary to dis-
tinguish the Alsatian from the Ger-

mans are the very obvious similari-
ties between the two, resulting from
the fundamental fact that the Al-
satian, as regards his origins, is
German, He has retained a number
of his Germanic traits, notably his
native German dialect and his in-
satiable desire for order and clean-
liness. (Alsatian landladies are no-
torious for this.)

His mentality is in no way Latin.
His physical characteristics resem-
ble those of the other Southern
Germanic peoples as the Bavarian.
But it is not a mistake to say that,
culturally, the Alsatian resembles
his counterpart across the Rhine less
at present. But this is not as much
the result of an extensive rapproche-
ment with the French, as with the
public character life in the Federal
Republic has taken: intensive mod-
ernization, etc., to a much greater

 

extent than is the case in Alsace.

 

French Influence
As has been said, under no cir-
cumstances should one exaggerate
the influence of French rule for
the better part of 40 years since
the first World War, particularly on
a social and cultural level. Having
been in Strasbourg during the past
five months, I have had the occa-
sion to hear one Alsatian woman
complain about characteristics of
women of the French interior, one

of whom her son married.

However, it is clear that political-
ly Alsace is a well-integrated part of
the French nation. It must be re-
membered that all Alsatians born
after, say 1915, (which includes all
under 45 years of age) have known
only five years or so of German
rule under Hitler. These genera-
tions have known French as a native
language and have _ accustomed
themselves to the French adminis-

 

trative system. Most recently they
have become involved in the Al-
gerian War along with the rest of
the nation, and their building have
received the paint jobs from the
OAS, which are at this moment as
characteristic of France as perfume.

In any case, the result of these
influences is the contemporary Al-
satian, to the description of whose
character must be added his provin-
cial traits. His capital is Strasbourg
(which has previously been called
Strassburgg, but which is now Stras-
booor), and this city is itself a
manifestation of the mixture which
has made him distinct. The city,
whose origins have been traced as
far back as 800 B.C. when it was
apparently a fishing center on the
Rhine, is symbolized by its magnifi-
cent cathedral (the single spire was
completed in 1439) which has been
called the “boldest achievement of

 

cathedral architecture.” At _ this
moment, the city, like its people, is
characterized by a dual nature. (Rue
Goethe, for example.)

A European Capital

What is distinguishing this region
and its capital further, presently, is
the centering of at least a part of
the current European movement
here. The Council of Europe (16
member states) occupies a large
building in Strasbourg, where the
sessions of the Parliamentary As-
sembly (the legislative body of the
Common Market) are held as well.
Despite competition from Luxem-
bourg and Brussels, Strasbourg has
a strong claim to become the capi-
tal of a new “Europe.”

And in this case one hopes this
fine old city, in becoming such, will,
along with the whole of Alsace, as-
sume some new characteristics which
will be permanent.

LX Team Plays Washington Tomorrow
Baseball Team Drops Four Out Of Stee Games

Coach Needs Football Players
For Winless Lacrosse Squad

W&M, U. Richmond Here Next Week!

Washington and Lee’s varsity baseball team hopes to get
back on the winning track next week after a disappointing
Southern trip over Spring recess in which they dropped three

out of four practice games
encounter.

Games with Lynchburg College
and Bridgewater were rained out
this week, but the Generals are
scheduled to play William and Mary
here on Tuesday and Richmond on
Wednesday.

The big problem over Spring re-
cess was lack of pitching. Lyles has
only four pitchers on whom he can
depend, and two of them are fresh-
men,

Senior righthander Phil Sharp
should be the mainstay of the pitch-
ing staff but hasn’t been up to par
so far this year. Sophomore leftie
Gamber will help out if he can get
rid of a bad case of early-season
wildness. Mason McGowin and Louis
Paterno, the freshmen, need more
experience, but Lyles said he was
fairly pleased with their showings
so far.

Batters Are Fair

The hitting was better than the
pitching over the recess, but still
leaves quite a bit to be desired.
Captain Ned Hobbs, the shortstop,
led the team in batting in the five
games last week, going 7-for-16.
Rightfielder Buck Rose was also hit-
ting the ball well, getting six hits
in 17 at-bats. Robin Wood and Bob-
by Williams were both 5-for-18.

Third baseman Chuck Lane’s hit-
ting has been a bit of a disappoint-
ment this year and Lyles has moved
him to the number seven spot in
the batting order, hoping for better
results from Lane.

In the field, Lyles says that the
double play combination of Ned
Hobbs at short and Park Gilmore at
second base has looked very good.
Gilmore has been getting the ball
away on the pivot a lot faster this
year than he had before.

Lyles says that he still has plenty
of problems, though. He needs a

and one regularly-scheduled

good-hitting first baseman and an-
other catcher to spell Jim Russ. Ash-
ley Allen was to have been second
catcher, but had to have four stitches
when his finger was split against
South Carolina last week. He’ll be
out of action at least another week.

Conditioning Poor

Lyles is also worried about the
team’s condition. Bad weather had
hampered practices before the
Southern swing and nearly every-
one on the squad was complaining of
a sore arm when the Generals start-
ed playing every day. Lyles gave
them as much exercise as he could
this week, but the weather has
kept them indoors too much.

The Spring trip was a study in
frustration. The Generals got good
hitting and pitching on occasion, but
got the two of them together in only
one game, their 14-3 conquest of
Atlantic Christian College.

After they were rained out of a
March 31 game with Elon College,
the ball players moved on to an
April 2 game with South Carolina at
Columbia. Phil Sharp turned in
what Coach Lyles called “a very
good job,” against the Gamecocks,
allowing eight hits and throwing only
83 balls in an eight-inning stint. But
South Carolina’s Bill Coleman turn-
ed in an even better job and the
Generals got only two hits and lost,
3-1.

The Generals’ hitting improved the
next day against Newberry College
but freshman pitcher Mason Mc-

 

Gowin, the W&L starter, gave out
too many walks in the five innings
he pitched and the Generals came
out on the short end of a 7-10 score
when reliefer Louis Paterno gave
up three runs in the eighth inning
to the Tigers. Lyles said, though,
that McGowin and Paterno “did fair-
ly well for freshmen.” Ned Hobbs
led the General hitting, going three-
for-four and hitting a 455-foot hom-
er.

It was almost the same story the
next day, as W&L returned to Co-
lumbia for another game with South
Carolina, a 6-10 loss. Sophomore
lefthander Brice Gamber started the
game for the Generals, but ran into
control trouble and gave up nine
runs before Paterno relieved him in
the fifth inning. But Paterno turned
in a fine relief game, giving up only
one run in the remaining three in-
nings. The only W&L win on the
trip came on April 4 against At-
lantic Christian College. The Gen-
erals got 14 hits against two ACC
pitchers and McGowin, his curve ball
working well, scattered eight oppo-
sition hits to gain a 14-3 victory.

W&L’s lack of pitching depth
really showed up in an April 6 game
with small-college toughie East Car-
olina. Lyles had to send in Paterno,
who had worked three innings on
each of the two preceding days,
when Sharp was injured with one
out the second inning. Paterno got
out of that inning safely, but was
shelled for 7 runs in the third, 3 in
the fourth, and 3 in the fifth, as
the Carolinians carried off a 13-2
victory.

The next day’s game with Norfolk
William and Mary, for which Lyles
had been saving Gamber, was rained
out.

Coach Bob McHenry says he needs some more football
players on his lacrosse team. According to McHenry, his boys
have been really pushed around the last few weeks—‘what we
need is some boys who don’t mind body contact. Hofstra,
Penn State, Massachusetts, and Brown were big and rough.

They really intimidated some of our*

boys.”

McHenry is looking forward to to-
morrow’s game here with Washing-
ton College. Washington doesn’t have
a football team.

The stickmen, 0-6 for the season,
need to do more than just get
rougher. McHenry says they need
to be in better shape, need more
experience, and have to make a lot
fewer mistakes.

It’s a young team, and he hopes
they’ll get better, but admits that
he is disappointed with their down-
slide from a fine performance against
the visiting Australian team three
weeks ago. “It seems like we’ve got-
ten steadily worse and worse. I
think we hit rock bottom against
Penn State last Saturday.”

McHenry is looking for a close
game against Washington. The

 

 

Sho’man have a good attack, led
by Skip Rudolph, the second lead-
ing scorer last year in the nation.
Their close defense is also strong.
But they’re a young team, like
W&L. McHenry says we'll have to
win the game in the midfield if we
win it.

If comparative scores mean any-
thing the two teams have played one
common opponent this year. Loyola
beat W&L 10-6, and Washington 6-5.
The Loyola coach told McHenry
that he sees the two as about even
but if he had to pick a winner, he’d
pick Washington.

McHenry singled out three W&L
players for praise on their perform-
ance to date.

“Johnny McDaniel is the team’s
leading scorer and seems to be get-

Ray Miller has been doing an
excellent job in the goal. He had
never played goal before this year,

The injuries are a real blow to a

New Constitution, Amendments

Amendment Presented To Allow

*

 

Press Coverage Of EC

By KEN LANE
Associate Editor

The new student body constitution proposed by the EC
was presented in an open forum last night by student body

president Uncas McThenia.

The purpose of the forum was to allow students to discuss
the new constitution before it is submitted on the election ballot

Thursday, April 26, for student body vote.

 

Before a turnout of about 15 stu-*

dents in Lee Chapel, McThenia re-
viewed the changes which the con-
stitution provides for, and opened the
floor for comments.

The discussion was centered
around the failure of the constitution
to replace the Publications Commit-
teeman by an elected representative,
and the failure to provide for a
student senate.

Petition Read

A petition was read by Roy Good-
win, representing the Tuesday edi-
tion of the Ring-tum Phi and the
Sigma Delta Chi journalistic society,
requesting that an amendment be
added providing for press represen-
tation on the EC.

Later in the meeting, a constitu-
tion was proposed by senior Ben
Brown, providing for a student sen-
ate and for changes in the pro-
cedure of Honor trials.

Spud Slater

Senior Spud Slater opened the
forum discussion by asking why the
EC had decided to retain its Publi-
cations member.

Committeeman John Paul re-
plied that the amendment failed to
get the two-thirds majority by a
close 7-5 vote. No agreement could
be made for getting a satisfactory
replacement,

Rosie Page stated that the Publi-
cations Board was felt to be one of
the most responsible bodies on cam-
pus and it is certain that the rep-
resentative selected is well-qualified.

Spud Slater asked why the EC had
not introduced a student senate in
student body government.

McThenia replied that a study of
other universities found that the
senate did not succeed except in
much larger student bodies.

The amendment petition for press
representation was read by Good-
win before the assembly. It will be
voted on at the Student Body Elec-
tion polls on April 26.

It stated as follows:

We the undersigned, hereby sub-
mit the enclosed amendment to the
Student Body Constitution, said
amendment to appear on the bal-
lot to be used

in the Student

Legislative meetings of the Ex-
ecutive Committee shall be open
to members of the campus press.
This shall include one reporter
from each edition of the Ring-tum
Phi, one member of the staff of
Home Edition, and one member
from each of the other recognized
media who choose to attend the
meetings.

The Executive Committee shall
retain the right of Executive Ses-
sion when such a session is called
by an E.C. member and approved
by a majority vote of the standing
E.C.

Ben Brown’s constitution will also
be voted on during the elections.
Among its major features is the in-
situation of the “advisor” and the
“examiner” in the Honor trials.
Brown explained that these two will
serve as a psychological aid to the
defendant.

The accused selects his own advis-
or before he makes any decisions.
The advisor will keep him informed
on the best course of action and try
to prevent the defendant from mak-
ing any rash action out of ignorance.

New Feature

A second feature of the consti-
tution was a student senate of 30
representatives. The purpose of the
senate, Brown stated, is to create
a “power vacuum” within the stu-
dent body with the hope that stu-
dents will respond to the challenge.

Senate Criticized

The idea of a senate received con-
siderable criticism. Steve Galef felt
that the senate would consume too
much time and students would lose
interest.

Tim Ireland termed it as “nice and
idealistic,’ but it would lead to “a
30-man captive audience.”

Meade Christian felt that it would
create more responsibilities than stu-
dents are willing to assume.

Brown Defends Senate

When questioned on the purpose
of the student senate, Brown stated
that it would “provide more repre-
sentation on campus, encourage more
student involvement in university
affairs, and also act as an adequate
forum for airing out student is-
sues.”

Brown optimistically spoke of the

Faculty Action Overrides

Earlier IFC Ruling”

By JOHN ALLGOOD ~<
Asst. Managing Editor

The Faculty Committee on Fraternities abruptly solved
the problem of conflicts between fraternity combos-and Uni-

versity dance Svsotiane
Dean Atwood infor
at its weekly meeting last night that
the action had been taken at the
recommendation of the Social Func-
tions Committee of the faculty.
The rule passed by the faculty
committee, as reported by Dean At-
wood states:

“There is to be no paid musical
entertainment by fraternities dur-
ing the hours of any University
dance function, i.e., both dances
and concerts.”

Ignore IFC

The action followed by only two
weeks action taken by the IFC to
discourage Friday night combos on
dance weekends and _ completely
wipes out the IFC action.

IFC president Bob Doenges, Sig-
ma Chi senior, expressed sorrow that

SIPA Conference To Feature
J.B.Reston And Hal Foster

James B. Reston, nationally
known columnist of The New
York Times, and Hal Foster,
creator of the cartoon charac-
ter “Prince Valiant,” will be
principal speakers for the 33rd

annual convention of the
Southern Interscholastic Press
Association.

The convention of more than 1,100
delegates will be held here April
27-28.

Reston will speak to the secon-
dary school representatives at 12:05
that Friday in Doremus Gymnasium.
Foster will follow him at 1:55 p.m.
These talks will also be open to
W&L students.

Reston Joins Times

Reston joined the New York Times
staff in its London Bureau in 1939.
Since that time he has reported na-
tional and international events for
the Times Organization. He remained
in London until 1941, when he re-
turned to the United States to work
at the Washington Bureau. There he
specialized in diplomatic and foreign
affairs.

Early in 1943 he was made an
assistant to the publisher, Arthur
Hays Sulzberger, and later that
year returned to London as acting
head of the Times Bureau.

In 1945 he became national cor-
respondent, and after the war was
named diplomatic correspondent
covering important national and in-
ternational political events. Today
he heads the Times Washington
Bureau.

 

Concert Guild To Present
Award Winning Pianist

An international award winning
pianist Wednesday will present the
fifth concert in the current season
of the Washington and Lee Concert
Guild.

Kenneth Amada, who holds an
award from 1960 International Queen
Elizabeth of Belgium Competition,
will play at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.
His program will include Beeth-
oven’s Sonata, Opus 53 in G Major
(Waldstein), Profokieff’s Sonata No.
7, Opus 83, Bach’s Italian Concerto
and Liszt’s Mephisto Waltz.

Amada began study of piano at
the age of three and made his debut
in Town Hall in 1951. His orchestral
appearances have been with the
Detroit Symphony, the Buffalo, the
Baltimore Symphony, the Warsaw
Philharmonic and the National Or-

;|chestra of Belgium.

 

During the early part of World
War II, he served as head of the
Information Service of the Office of
War Intelligence in the American
Embassy.

In 1944 Reston was awarded the
Pulitzer Prize for his news dis-
patches and interpretative articles
on the Dumbarton Oaks Security
Conference. Again in 1957 he won
a Pulitizer Award for national re-
porting.

Debate Team
Wins On TV

By C. C. FLIPPEN
Associate Editor

 

Washington and Lee debaters con-
tinued their television debate win-
ning streak by defeating Davidson
College last week at Chapel Hill,
= ©.

Veteran debaters Al Eckes, Bill
Boardman, and Bill Noell success-
fully defended the affirmative side of
the Question, Resolved: That Capital
Punishment Be Abolished. The hour
long match was carried over WUNC
in Chapel Hill, April 9.

Of the teams competing in the
series only W&L and Wake Forest
remain undefeated. They will meet
to determine the championship on
May 14. The topic for this final
debate has not yet been chosen.

Sunday Eckes and Noell took part
in another television debate held
over WRVA-TV in Richmond. The
two debated a team from Randolph-
Macon College on the topic, Re-
solved: That the United States With-
draw from the United Nations.

No decision was given, but Wil-
liam Chaffin, director of debate ac-
tivities said today “the producers
of the show were so impressed by
the debate that they have an-
nounced plans to carry ten weeks
of similar programs next fall with
scholarships going to winning
schools,”

This Richmond Television debate
marked the fourth of five scheduled
TV appearances for the W&L team
since February.

Norton, Morris Enter

In debate activity over the holi-
days Ed Norton and Malcolm Mor-
ris were entered in the Georgetown
Novice Tournament. They debated
four rounds on both sides of the
national debate question and com-
piled a 2-2 record. The tournament
was held March 31.

 

Among his other awards and hon-
ors are several honorary degrees
from universities throughout the na -
tion, the Overseas Press Club
Award, Chevalier de la Legion
d’Honneur and the University of
Missouri Medal of Honor for dis-
tinguished service in journalism.

Hal Foster began his varied career
far from the field of Journalism or
cartooning. At the age of 14 he was
a fur trapper helping to support his
family in Nova Scotia. At 18 he quit
school to work full time in support-
ing his family.

During the next three years he
worked as office helper, a guide in
the forests of Canada and a gold
prospector.

In 1921 Foster determined on a
career as an artist and enrolled as
a student in the Art Institute,
Academy of Fine Arts and the Na-
tional Academy in Chicago.

In addition to these and other
speakers the weekend convention
will include judging and awards to
various scholastic publications. More
than 175 schools have submitted the
305 publications to be judged. They
come from ten southern states and
Washington.

Last year, The Chatterbox of
George Washington High School
in Danville, Va., was the winner of
the Scholastic Press Award of the
Virginia Press Association.

The other three state scholastic
press awards were the Wildcat of
New Tanover High School in N. C.,
the Pequonion of Elkview High
School in W. Va., and The Yellow
Jacket of Boys High School in S. C.

 

Psychology Professors
To Participate In Meet

Two Washington and Lee psy-
chology professors will participate
in the program of the 45th annual
meeting of the Southern Society for
Philosophy and Psychology in Mem-
phis, Tenn., April 19-21.

Dr. William W. Hinton, head of
the university’s psychology depart-
ment, is president of the society
and will direct the convention.

Dr. Leonard E. Jarrard, assistant
professor of psychology at Washing-
ton and Lee, will present a paper
on the “Effects of X-irradiation on
Operant Behavior in the Rat” during
a morning session on conditioning
and learning.

The meeting will include seminars,
symposiums, general sessions and
exhibits and displays from various
universities and colleges throughout
the South.

yesterday afternoon.

 

the IFC*

 

ward solving this problem had seem-
ingly been wasted .

“The faculty has overruled the IFC
and taken what action that it deemed
necessary to solve the problem,”
Doenges said.

The IFC action wiped out by the
faculty provided:

1. All fraternity combo parties in
conflict with University sponsored
dances on Friday nights of dance
weekends will be closed. Closed is
to be defined as members of one fra-
ternity only and the party shall be
held in the house of that fraternity.

2. No fraternity may compel one
of its members to pay an extra so-
cial assessment for said combo to be
held in conflict...if that member
wishes to attend the dance instead
of the combo party.

COeeeeeecececcesoeseeses
(See editorial on page 2)
COCCCH COCO COO OECOCEOEEEE

Doenges said when the IFC passed
their regulations that, “this new IFC
amendment, I feel, will bring about a
gradual and effective solution to the
combo-University dance conflict. It
does not radically forbid combos at
any time, but it does provide rules
to prevent any slight or large ma-
jority in any house from forcing
their will for a combo upon a mi-
nority.”

Today Doenges still says “the IFC’s
action would have been a solution
to the problem, but the faculty failed
to give it a chance to work.”

The Faculty Committee on Frater-
nities is composed of Dean W. W.
Pusey, III; professors Jarrard, Phil-
lips, Spencer, Starling, Stephenson,
Stevens; Mr. Mattingly, Mr. Farrar.

Dance Board President

President of the Dance Board,
Steve Galef, stated that he was sorry
to see the faculty action. However,
he added that the students should
have taken a firmer stand from the
start.

Faculty Committee Combo Rule
Denies Basic LFC Right

The Faculty Committee on Fraternities’ action yesterday
which bans fraternity combos during the hours of Univer-
sity sponsored social functions, in our opinion, has further
denied the IFC a basic right to have control over its individual
members.

The fear of “intervention” from the hill may have been
present in the IFC before yesterday’s action, but today that
fear has been given a front row seat in the IFC meetings.

The mandate issued Monday has clearly taken more power
from the students’ hands, right or wrong, and has put it into
the hands of the Administration.

The EFC recently passed what in our opinion was a
workable solution to the combo question in that the
IFC rule prohibited “double spending” for entertain-
ment. We believe that the IFC rule would have worked
had it been given a reasonable period of time to prove
itself. The IFC’s plan perhaps was weak in the eyes of
those in power, but we firmly believe that it should have
been given a chance to work before it was killed.

The Faculty Committee on Fraternities, we are sad to re-
port, has now squelched any future hope the IFC may have
had for handling their own problems in their own way. The
Administration also has made it clear that there is only one
side of questions—their side.

It is a heartbreaking fact that the IFC and the Adminis-
tration apparently could not get together and work up a so-
lution to the problem.

It is equally heartbreaking to the students to see that the
Administration has resorted to a ‘“‘jam it down the students’
throats’”’ method which does not characterize the way in which
Washington and Lee has or should operate.

The Tuesday Edition feels that the IFC has done
much this year in cooperating with the Dance Board.
As evidenced by the attendance at all the dances this
year, IFC action has worked, and we feel that more co-
operation was on the way, had the IFC’s rule been given
a chance to work.

For all three dance sets this year the IFC has acted to deny
fraternity competition with the University social functions.
This action delayed, and in the case of Springs, it prohibited
combos during the hours of University events. Dance atten-
dance has also been far better than that of last year, and one
cannot overlook the part the IFC has played in this progress.
It seems to us, however, the Faculty Committee has chosen to
“forget” these incidents of cooperation.

As Tuesday Columnist George Honts says elsewhere on
this page, perhaps the IFC is to blame for the intervention.
We, however, cannot altogether accept this premise since the
IFC plan was never given a chance to work.

The long-range effects of this action will have the
result, we fear, that no matter what the IFC wants, the
Administration is going to do what it wants. We also
feel that it is all too obvious that the above isn’t in keep-
ing with W&L’s belief of student control over students,
as witnessed by our Honor System, the Student Control
Committee, etc.

We sincerely hope that yesterday’s decision by the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities is not an indication of the direction
in which this University seems to be heading.

Tuesday Edition’s Amendment
For Press Representation

The Tuesday Edition, in conjunction with Sigma Delta Chi,
national journalistic society, has co-sponsored an amendment
which will be voted upon in the Student Body elections to be
held April 26.

Our amendment, which is presented in what we feel are
the best interest of Washington and Lee, would insure that
members of the recognized campus press are not denied the
right to attend the legislative (and only the legislative) meet-
ings of the Executive Committee.

We are the first to realize that there are a number of oc-
casions which dictate that a certain amount of secrecy in govern-
ment be allowed. For this reason, we have included in our reso-
lution a stipulation which gives the Executive Committee the
leeway of holding “executive sessions” when the Committee, by
a majorty vote, deems it necessary.

The Executive Committee this year has been highly cooper-
ative with the Tuesday Edition, and we sincerely thank the EC
for this attitude. The EC recently has allowed us to attend the
legislative meetings and for this move we were, and are, grate-
ful. But what of the future Executive Committees?

We, as members of the press which is supposed to be the
“Voice of the Student Body,” feel that we should be given
constitutional protection for our basic rights, and for this reason
we have sponsored this bill.

It is our sincere hope that the Student Body will endorse
our move, which we feel is in the students’ best interests, by
voting “yes” for this amendment.

(The entire amendment is printed on page 1 of today’s
paper.)

(Continued on page 4)

Editor’s Note: The following article appeared
in Sunday’s Roanoke Times-World News.

Generations of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity students have learned about the Civil
War from Dr. William Gleason Bean.

His lectures on the war, its battles and its
many personalities are still vivid in the mem-
ories of many. For them, there has been no
other expert.

The tall Alabama native drew on a vast
storehouse of information to make the Civil

 

War just about the most interesting period in
the nation’s history.

The students soon learned this was Dr. Bean’s
favorite period of American History. As a
youngster in Alabama, he heard members of his
family talk about their experiences in the war
and this was his first knowledge of history.

The struggle was “our great war.” Dr. Bean
believes, and it brought unity to the nation.

This June Dr. Bean will conclude a 40-year
career in education when he retires as head of
W&L’s history department where he has been
Doughlas Southall Freeman Professor of His-
tory and a Professor on the Thomas Ball Foun-
dation.

Dr. W. G. Bean (left) discusses historical papers with Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw.

He will turn over his duties to Ollinger Cren-
shaw who came to W&L as a freshman the year
Dr. Bean began his teaching career at Gen.
Lee’s school.

There still will be some teaching. Dr. Bean
will continue to teach two courses three days
a week.

Retirement will not mean an end to his work,
though. He has a number of writing tasks,
travel and reading on his schedule. There will

be plenty of work to do in Lexington—“My
wife is going to keep me busy,” he notes.
Those who know the historian and teacher
also know he’ll have plenty of time for those
walks, too. “I’m a great walker,” he states. Be-
yond that there’ll be the garden to tend to also.

He terms the most significant event during his
teaching career as the development of a system
under which grants are awarded to teachers for
study and research on books and articles.

As for retirement, one of the bright points
he sees is that he will not have to devote so
much of his time to grading papers.

He will soon have another book ready, having
completed the first draft on the Liberty Hall

 

W&L Men Will Remember Dr. Bean
As The Expert Civil War Historian

Volunteers, Washington College students who
served with the Stonewall Jackson Brigade
during the Civil War. He plans to call it “Col-
lege Boys in Gray.”

Dr. Bean is also editing the diary of John
Apperson, a medical orderly in the Stonewall
Brigade who became a prominent Western Vir-
ginia doctor after the war. A daughter, Miss
Mary Apperson, lives in Blacksburg and his
son, the late Harvey B. Apperson, was a
prominent Roanoke area attorney before going
to the State Supreme Court of Appeals.

The W&L professor is a member of the
Virginia Civil War Centennial Commission
and feels this unit has accomplished much
by providing an information center in Rich-
mond where people can learn about the broad
scope of the battles before going to view the
sites,

The Heflin, Ala., native first became in-
volved in the field of education after he gradu-
ated from high school at the age of 16. His
father thought he was too young to go to col-
lege. So he began his 40-year career teaching
in rural schools.

The lanky youngster then went to the Uni-
versity of Alabama in 1910 and completed his
work in three years. He got into the field of
higher education while a graduate student at
Harvard from 1920 to 1922.

The future head of W&L’s history depart-
ment came to the Lexington school in the fall
of 1922 and became head of the department in
1930. He previously had been acting head for
three years.

Looking back on his career, he can recall a
lot of “good memories.” Working with young
students has been very interesting and he’s
particularly proud of the students who have
joined him in the field of teaching history.

The development of an honors program at
W&L, he believes, has been very beneficial to
students. “It’s a little master’s degree,” he notes
of the thesis program.

Dr. Bean believes young historians ought to
consider writing histories of Western Virginia
counties, cities and towns. The field has hard-
ly been touched, he states. This goes along
with his belief that greater emphasis on re-
search in colleges has been vital to the
growth and development of higher education.

With more leisure time, Dr. Bean plans to
return to the many important battlefields for
more study. He would like to take another
look at Little Round Top at Gettysburg.

The real fighting in the great battle took place
there during the first and second days, he
states. Greater emphasis is placed on Pickett’s

By THORNS CRAVEN ee

Failure Of IFC To Compromise

Tuesday Columnist

With the end of school rapidly approaching, and my im-

 

 

 

pending graduation looming larger, I have begun to make
some forays into the outside world to see what it will be like.

Twice
crawled out of the Washington and
Lee womb in order to make con-
tact with government and private
interests. If you want my advice,
stay in school for the rest of your
life. Working doesn’t look like it’s
going to be much fun.

I can back up that statement with
a few examples of the things I’ve
learned in my recent interviews,
and I think you'll be able to see
the contrasts with our sheltered
life here when it’s compared with
the bomb-sheltered life out there.

In the first place, I’ve learned
that there are absolutely no cuts.
Those of you without cuts realize
the hardships which are encountered
in this situation, and I’m sure
those of you with them can imagine
the horrors contained in a system
that operates in this manner.

If, perchance, you think you'll
find some exception to this general
pattern I can assure you that you
won't. I’ve investigated this from
every angle, and there’s just no
way out.

Another related horror of the out-
side world is the shift system. Un-
fortunately college-trained business
leaders have never felt it necessary
to put their affairs on our more
cilivized basis of class hours.

They all go to work at 8:30 miss-
ing the advantage of the lucky stu-
dent having all 10:15’s.

When thinking about my exper-
ience with interviewers there seems
to be only one conclusion to make,
and only one gem of wisdom to
offer you. The only decision concern-
ing my post-graduation endeavours
that I have made is that work will
be hard, and therefore, it is best not
to. So I’ve looked back on my col-
lege career to see how I could have
done things differently in order to
avoid working outside, and I think
that some of you might do well to
follow this course.

The best way to prepare for stay-
ing out of the outside world is to
never exceed a C average during
your first year here. Then flunk out

 

during the second semester of your

 

in the last month I’ve*

 

sophomore year. Get re-instated
after a couple of semesters of travel-
ing around, then flunk out again.
Go now to a mediocre little school,
flunk out there, and then get into
the worst possible school imaginable,
and finish up your college career in
a blaze of effort that shows you
really care. By this time you are old

enough to marry a bosses’ daughter, | ®

and are ready to enter the outside
word as an observer and not a par-
ticipator.

Students who have already gone
too far in college careers to follow
this handy guide to success should
try to get into the swing of things
at the appropriate level. Seniors are
doomed.

I can only recommend to all of
you that if it’s at all possible, stay
away from the outside. There’s noth-
ing but trouble there, and here you
only have to worry about the weath-

er.

Was Cause Of ‘Hill’s’ Action

By GEORGE HONTS
Tuesday Columnist

The faculty committee pronounce-
ment banning fraternity combos
during any uni-
versity social
function is a re-
grettable thing...
regrettable from
y the standpoint
- that the faculty
- feels impelled to
take such actions
on behalf of the
student body.

 

Undoubtedly
Honts many, if not most
m of the student

body looks upon the action with dis-
favor. Undoubtedly they do not see
the reasoning behind the move, just
as the faculty apparently is unable
to see why students feel they have
a right to combos.

I do not support the faculty com-
mittee move. I am opposed to the
faculty dictating policies of this na-
ture to the student body. On the
other hand, having a slight insight
to the faculty attitude toward the
area of “conflicting interest” be-
tween the university social functions
and the combos, it is clear that they
felt their action was necessary.

Who is to blame for the pro-
nouncement? The faculty committee
to a degree, but part of the blame
must rest upon the IFC represen-
tatives and/or the students who
handcuffed them in the effort to
make effective compromise earlier
this semester.

People on the “inside” tell me
that the IFC was on the verge of
an acceptable compromise in the
form of the banning of Friday night
combos on dance weekends. This
measure failed to pass by a 7 to 9
vote.

What is just as unfortunate as the
faculty committee dictation of poli-
cy is the fact that the IFC and the
faculty committee could not get to-
gether officially to discuss the situa-
tion. Such a discussion did not come
until yesterday when it was already

 

doomed by inaction or weak action
on the part of the IFC. Certainly
this is not to say that the IFC so-
cial committee and the IFC president
did not do all their power to present
a working formula. They did, with
the blessing of the Dance Board,
and the probable asquiescence of the
faculty committee, but the IFC chose
not to accept it.

It is my firm conviction that the
students of Washington and Lee are
capable of making decisions of this
nature for themselves. It is unfortu-
nate that they did not do so.

In the interest of harmony in stu-
dent-faculty relations and in the in-
terest of making the student body,
particularly fraternity men, more
aware of their responsibility, it is
my hope that this question is not
closed, that the faculty committee
will rescind its stand and let the
IFC reconsider its position on so-
cial functions. Realizing, however,
that this is a slim hope which will
not very likely be realized, may I
make the suggestion that the stu-
dents familiarize themselves with
the faculty attitudes on such matters
and perhaps do some constructive
thinking on their own so that such
situations will not continually de-

velop into misunderstandings of
this nature.
It is highly unpleasant to be

treated as a young teen-ager, es-
pecially in an environment which
has long had pride in the freedom
which it offers.

It is highly unpleasant to be dic-
tated to, but with a developing of a
more responsible attitude on the part
of the students, perhaps we can
stem the tide before it gets out of
hand.

Highlight Sports Show;

Robrecht Wins Bout

The annual Valley Youth Fitness
and Sports Show came to the VMI
Fieldhouse this past weekend.

Sponsored by the Junior Cham-
ber of Commerce, this year’s offer-
ing featured Paul Anderson, world
champion weightlifter, Barry Mc-
Kay, who gave a tennis clinic,
Jimmy Patton, NFL all-pro foot-
ball player and Bob Davis, basket-
ball hall of famer.

Anderson, called the world’s
strongest man, lived up to his billing
by breaking the world record for the
military press of 407 lbs. with a hoist
of 416.

Robrecht Wins

Of special interest to W&L stu-
dents was Ray Robrecht’s unana-
mous win over Bobby Tomblin. Ro-
brecht outpointed the Richmond
middleweight in the feature bout
Saturday night to notch his thir-
teenth victory. The W&L boxer, who
fights for the Roanoke PAL, will
fight again April 24th in what he
thinks will be his last encounter
before hanging up his gloves.

Washington Edges Stickmen, 6-5

By AL JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

The Sho-men from Washington
College defeated W&L’s_ winless
stickmen, 6-5, here Saturday.

Led by Skip Rudolph, who scored
four goals and had a key assist,
they tallied six goals to the Generals
five.

The most outstanding play of the
game was early in the third per-
iod when W&L defenseman and
Co-captain Bart Mitchell inter-
cepted a shot in front of the Gen-
erals’ goal and sprinted all the
way downfield to tie the score,
2-2,

Rudolph, a senior attackman and
Marylands’ high scorer last year,
turned in his assist on a goal by
Dave Rodgers, three minutes into
the final quarter. It sent Washington
ahead for good with a score of 5-4,
after the score had been tied four
times. Thirty-six seconds later,
Rudolph himself scored the winning
goal.

Errors, Walks, Wild Pitches Help
Lynchburg Outscore Generals, 10-7

conducive to good pitching. Phil
Sharp, the Generals’ starter Friday,
will testify to this. He came on the
short end of a 10-7 score.

Sharp gave up five walks in eight
and two-thirds innings. Three of the
walks came in the first, when the
Hornets got to Sharp for three runs
on no hits and two errors.

As it turned out, these three were
the eventual margin of victory.

Lynchburg added two runs each
in the fifth and sixth innings, one
in the eighth on a single and three
wild pitches, and two in the ninth.

W&L got one in the first, two in
the second, two in the seventh, and
two in the ninth.

Lynchburg only managed four hits
off Sharp and his successor, Brice
Gamber, but five walks, one balk,
four wild pitches, and five errors led
to W&L’s downfall.

Russ Homers

The Generals’ Jim Russ got the
biggest hit of the day a seventh-
inning home run with Bobby Wil-
liams on base. Ned Hobbs’ triple in
the first also accounted for a run.

“We'd have won on good pitching,”
coach Joe Lyles commented after the
game. “It wasn’t his (Sharp’s) own
fault. But he kept the ball low.”

Sharp threw 144 pitches, fighting
wind and the thermometer all the
way. He was also picked off third
base.

‘Lefty’ Gomez
Works With
W&L Pitchers

Washington and Lee’s pitching
staff benefitted from the Valley
Sports Show over the weekend to
the extent of some personal coach-
ing from an ex-pro, former New
York Yankee star “Lefty” Gomez.

Gomez, traveling for Wilson
Sporting Goods, spoke at the show
and was introduced by W&L coach
Joe Lyles. Sunday he came up to
Wilson Field to work with some
of Lyle’s pitchers, especially Phil
Sharp and Brice Gamber.

“It was so cold we all turned
blue,” Lyles said, “but I think the
coaching the boys got helped. I
was very happy and thankful that a
man of his talent should help.”

Gomez, a lefthanded power in
the American League for many
years, later coached in the Yankee
farm system. He currently travels
some 93,000 miles a year for Wilson.

Tuesday Edition’s Amendment

(Continued from page 2)

Why should the press, which theoretically represents the
students who elected the EC members, not be allowed to at-
tend legislative meetings, and why should we have to be given
“permission” to attend meetings, when our attendance is
generally recognized as being our inherent right?

Those who do not feel that such an amendment is in order
raise the cry that the question of press representation should be
voted on a “year to year” basis. We ask our opponents why
the campus press should be denied the right it has to attend
meetings which affect every student?

We don’t feel that our plea will fall on deaf ears, and we
do not believe that we are requesting changes for the sake of
change. Our motives, we assure our readers, have been well
thought out and have been presented for your acceptance or
rejection. We invite comment from students, and we pledge
that we will accept your views in the same good faith that you
accept ours.

Spring Dances A Success

The Tuesday Edition is pleased to note the success of the
past Spring Dance Set. Thanks to the co-operation between
the fraternities and the Dance Board, there were no conflict-
ing combo parties with the concerts, and attendance at the
evening concerts was excellent.

The idea of having two concerts in place of the usual dances
proved to be quite successful. We hope that this practice will
continue to be followed.

Steve Galef, dance board president, is to be congratulated
for an excellent job in planning dance sets this year. We hope
that the dance sets next year will be as well planned and suc-
cessful as they have been this year.

Frank Young, next year’s presi-
dent of the Dance Board, was shock-
ed when he learned of the faculty
decision.

He stated, “The faculty did not
give the student body and the IFC
a chance to solve its own problems.
The IFC was making an effort to
cooperate with the Dance Board. An
agreement had been reached and
the excellent attendance at Springs
Dances showed that a solution was
possible.”

Young further added that he be-
lieved that the Faculty action will
not help increase the attendance at
dance sets but will do more harm
than good.

Bowen, Butler, Nea Named New Editors

By ROGER PAINE

In a three and one-half hour
meeting yesterday afternoon the
Publications Board elected Lanny

Butler of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and
Andy Nea of Phi Gamma Delta, as
editors-elect of the Tuesday and
Friday editions of the Ring-tum Phi.

Bill Bowen was elected editor of
the Southern Collegian, Ed Holmes,

S.A.E., was chosen Business Man-
ager of the Ring-tum Phi, and
Charlie Hart, Phi Psi, was selected

Business Manager of the Southern
Collegian.

Both Butler and Nea were the
Managing Editors of their respective
newspapers this year. Butler is pres-
ident of the junior class, a dorm
councilor, football letterman, and a
dean’s list student. Nea has written
for the Southern Collegian, is an of-
ficer in his fraternity, and is a mem-
ber of the IFC.

Collegian Contest

The most interesting contest of
the afternoon was for the editorship
of the Southern Collegian. George
Honts opposed Bowen for the posi-
tion, After nearly an hour of debate
in the Publications Board over these
two candidates, an impasse in the
voting was reached.

It was then necessary to suspend
the rule in the constitution of the
Board that a publications editor must
be elected by a two-thirds majority
of the Board. It was only after this
action was taken that a final deci-
sion was reached.

Bowen is Photography Editor of
both editions of the Ring-tum Phi.

 

While serving two years in the
Navy, he edited a three volume year-
book for the U.S.S. Forrestal. He
is currently teaching course in
photography for the Journalism
School. Honts is this year’s Execu-
tive Editor of the Southern Col-
legian, and was last year’s Managing
Editor of the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi,

opposed for the positions of Business

fraternity, a member of the Student
Service Society, and is in the Cotil-
lion Club.

Holmes has distinguished himself
scholastically as an Honor Roll and
Dean’s List student. He was initiat-
ed into Phi Eta Sigma his freshman
year. He has been initiated this
year into Alpha Epsilon Delta, hon-
orary pre-med fraternity. Holmes
worked last year as the Assistant to
the Business Manager of the Ring-
tum Phi, is a member of the 13 club
and is a fraternity officer.

The main bone of contention in
the Collegian election was the policy

 

of the two candidates. Bowen pro-
posed a new kind of Collegian, sug-
gesting that the reference to sex
and drinking characteristic of the
Collegian this year would be elimi-
nated or kept to a minimum. In its
place, he proposed a more sophisti-
cated humor for the magazine, mak-
ing greatest use of satire and parody.
He hopes to eliminate jokes as a
highlight of the Collegian, and con-
centrate attention on feature stories
and picture stories centered upon
local themes.

employed

Honts defended the

style that has been in

the Collegian, planning to maintain
the general format used in past
years.
Board Suports Change

It was decided by the Board that
a change in the style of the Col-
legian was needed, and that Bowen
best offered a chance for the full-
filment of such a change

Butler and Nea have said that
they will work together as editors
of the two editions of the Ring-
tum Phi more closely than has been
done in the past. A Ring-tum Phi
Forum involving panel discussions
on pertinent points of debate will be

 

 

instituted in the coming year. Both
candidates said that they would have
an objective editorial policy, and
that they “would not be afraid to
speak out against the administra-
tion.”

A rotating group of guest column-
ists was proposed by Nea, while
Butler stated that he would publi-
cize visiting speakers more.

The newspaper elections went rel-
atively quickly in comparison to the
long-debated Collegian elections.
The Board was adjourned shortly
after 5:30, having been in session
since 2:00.

According to Dean Atwood, the
story behind the abolition of fra-
ternity combos during University-

last year when the Social Func-
tions Committee first began in-
vestigating a situation that they
considered “unhealthy for the gen-
eral interest of the student body.”

This situation was the increasing

conflict between fraternity enter-
tainment and university entertain-
ment, brought on by the mediocre

quality of entertainment provided by
the dance board during the past
years, and also the decline of inter-
est in formal dances as such.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Friday Edition

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

The Faculty’s Decree

Student self-government at Washington and Lee is a tra-
dition second only to the Honor System, and at the heart of
this tradition is the fraternity system. Without inter-fraternity
rivalry for campus political posts, there would be little or no
interest in student government, and no means by which capable
leadership would be guaranteed. Except in extreme cases, the
faculty and Administration have respected the role of fraterni-
ties in the extra-curricular life of the University, and the stu-
dents have appreciated this policy. Indeed, until last Monday,
there seemed to be a tacit agreement between the faculty and
the student body that students and fraternities had a definite

“tight” to self-government.

For this reason, the faculty’s decision to forbide fraternity
entertainment during Dance Board functions came as quite a
shock, and has aroused a great deal of indignation among stu-
dents. The action in itself was rather trivial. As the University
dances have been all but eliminated, the faculty’s ruling will
affect primarily the hours in which concerts are scheduled. If
the quality of the concerts remain at this year’s level, no one
can really complain. But by stepping in on a trivial situation,
the faculty has established a precedent which can only be dis-
tasteful to the student body, and which is directly opposed to
the W&L tradition of student self-government. If the faculty
will exploit their power in a minor matter such as this, what

will they do next?

Further, the action, as we see it, was completely unjustified.
The faculty gave as its reason for the action the fact that there
is a duplication of costs to the student when fraternity enter-
tainment and Dance Board entertainment conflict. Well, we
think the faculty members have stepped out of their province
when they begin to dictate the way in which the students are to
spend money on weekend entertainment. If the faculty is so
interested in the welfare of the student’s pocketbooks, they
could begin by lowering the rates on the rooms in Baker Dorm.

What scares us and a number of students is that there seems
to be a powerful group on the faculty who try to make the
fraternities scapegoats for the University’s numerous academic
shortcomings. This is a cowardly attitude.

From what we have seen of other campuses, there seem
to be two possible results when a faculty or administration tries
to regulate student social life in detail: (1) Students do as they
please in such numbers that the rules become a farce and
hyprocrisy extends to all phases of campus life. (2) Students
who expect a degree of independence in their personal lives go

elsewhere. Neither possibility

is an attractive one for this

Back To Politics

The University Party’s slate of candidates, announced to-
day, is a strong one, particularly for the “Big Three” posi-
tions—Tim Ireland for president of the student body, Bill
Boardman for vice president, and Lanny Butler for secretary.

The UP candidates have offered a strong and progressive
platform, although we disagree with their stand on the Publi-
cations Board EC representative.

This morning, the Independent Party, in order not to be
beaten to the gun on a platform by the University Party, re-
leased a broadside containing some platform proposals. Their
platform, which seems to us remarkably devoid of any original
thought, is evidently an attempt to cover their usual reluctance
to nominate until the University Party has made the first move.

 

Is the Hill Really Anti-Fraternity?

By TRACY HARRINGTON

The latest decree of the faculty—
concerning the ban on combos dur-
ing University-sponsored dances and
concerts—fits in perfectly with a
well established anti-fraternity trend
on the Hill, a trend which, if con-
tinued, will probably lead to the
extinction of the social fraternity
at Washington and Lee—and there is
no indication that it won’t continue.

The chain of events which are
now so obviously stifling and dilut-
ing fraternity life began with the
construction of the Commons and
the requirement that all freshmen
take their meals there. Formerly,
all freshmen ate at the various
houses. But a dining hall was a
definite good. It provided an oppor-
tunity for more intra-class associa-
tions, as well as giving non-fratern-
ity men an inexpensive and con-
venient place to eat. And, although
fraternities were weakened some-
what financially and were deprived
of their primary means of “making
freshmen brothers” the good out-
weighed the bad.

Since that time, the faculty has
spoken out against pledge training
(Hell Week), first semester rush, and
and now combos during dances.

Help Week Proposed

The Help Week proposals were for
the most part constructive and
necessary. Again, although a valu-
able facet of fraternity life had been
threatened, the good outweighed the
bad. Hell Week still exists, due
largely to the fact that it has proven
the most effective means of unifying
pledge classes. It has been highly
altered, however, as a_ result of
pressure from the Hill. It won’t be
long before fraternities must seek
another means of pledge training.

Deferred Rushing
The next anti-fraternity step by

 

the faculty was, fortunately, tem-
porarily abandoned — publicly, at
least. I’m speaking of the unfortu-
nate and unnecessary petition for
deferred rush. Its proponents declar-
ed that a second semester or soph-
omore rush would relieve freshmen
of many pressures, and minimize
“mistakes” on the part of both fra-
ternities and pledges. They said,
also, that a later rush would make
for easier assimilation of the fresh-
men into the University as a whole.

Curiously enough, they ignored
the fact that deferred rushing would
close six houses. As far as mistakes
go, I think the congeniality of nearly
every house on campus shows this
up as a poor, if not contrived, ar-
gument. Speaking as a freshman, I
can say that my “assimilation into
the University as a whole” has been
much easier by close association
with upper classmen sincerely in-
terested in me as brothers. I could
not have had such an association
if I had not pledged a fraternity.
This viewpoint is, I believe, held by
the vast majority of freshmen.

There are other, more subtle signs
that indicate the trend away from
University support of the fraterni-
ties. More dorms are being con-
structed, and one professor has even
suggested that house mothers be
“hired university officials.”

Ban on Combos

Subtlety cannot be ascribed to the
ban on combos. We cannot suppose
that the faculty are so naive as not
to realize that parties are a vital part
of fraternity life. A fraternity is a
group of mutually congenial people
who like to have fun together. By
eliminating eight fraternity combo
parties a year, the faculty has taken
a giant step forward in killing the
social fraternity.

Reviewing the IFC proposal for
closed combos during University

 

functions, I can see no reason what-
soever why it wasn’t at least given
a testing period. The faculty has
made its position painfully clear:
The IFC is fine, and so is student
government—as long as University—
Hill—policy is parroted. Perhaps the
game of “student self government”
has ceased to amuse the indulging
fathers in Washington Hall, and
they’ve decided to put an end to
the whole silly thing.

Now is the time for the fraterni-
ties, the dance board, and the IFC
to see just how far the alleged
freedom of Washington and Lee ex-
tends.

Appeal to Alumni

I suggest constructive and mature
opposition to the faculty decision.
Initially, it might prove worthwhile
for fraternities to send out form let-
ters to alumni explaining the situa-
tion in detail, and asking that the
alumni express their opinions to the
administration. Whether the results
condemned or upheld the ban action,
they would at least be highly re-
vealing.

Secondly, the dance board itself
could take moves to assuage the
damage that has been done. Dances
could simply be discontinued, and
efforts made to schedule two good
concerts on the four major week-
ends, Or, dances could be set at
7:30-10:30 p.m., still allowing two
and a half or three hours for combo
parties afterwards.

Whether or not the trend towards
tearing apart the fraternity has been
intentional or not cannot be pre-
sumed here. It would seem highly
improbable, though, that the moves
taken which have been discussed in
this article are unrelated.

Why Hit Dance Sets?

Publications Board EC Representative
Called Anachronistic Abomination

By HOWARD SLATER

Of all the stupid and ludicrous
jokes which have been forced upon
us in the name of good student
government, the presence of a Pub-
lications Board representative on
the EC is the ugliest and least hum-
orous.

The men on the EC and the pri-
vate citizens who have supported
this anachronistic abomination, have
hemmed and hawed, smiled self-
consciously, and limped through de-
fense of the Publications Board
Representative. But with it all,
they’ve come up with no excuses—
only proofs of their faulty logic,
selfish motives, and undemocratic
convictions.

The argument goes that the rep-
resentative has always been a worth-
while member of the EC. Therefore,
why change him for an unknown
quantity? Moreover, he is usually
a member of the senior class, and
seniors are notorious for their ma-
turity and responsible outlook on
life. Although he is not chosen
through a democratic election, he is
chosen by a body—the Publications
Board—which may even be more
capable of picking the most suitable
men for the EC than the rest of the
students themselves!

 

Ridiculous Trash

Bull! Double Bull!! What are all
these arguments, but the same bo-
vine species! How long can such
ridiculous trash continue to pass for
true statements? No more nor less
has been said then than if it’s been
done in the past, it ought to be done
in the future.

No! Just because there’s been a
Publications Board representative in
the past isn’t good enough. Once and
for all, is this a democratic student
government we have or isn’t it? Can
we not at least attempt to maintain
a democratic spirit, Even if there are
difficulties in achieving the ideal in
its entirety?

Those who say that the Publica-
tions Board is better qualified to
choose men for the EC than the
junior class, for instance, must be
laughing up their sleeves. What they
are really saying is that the smaller
the group that determines who will
be on the EC the better. And no fool
in his right mind would seriously
claim that the more seniors on the
EC the better. If there is something
that marks off a freshman when he
comes here, it usually has been
lost by the time he is a junior. And
I'd take half the freshman class right
now to be more mature than the

 

jackasses who are still fighting to
preserve the Liberty Hall Academy.

Why Trust the Elite?

Down with the eighteenth centry!
Down with those who are opposed
through and through to democratic
precodures! There is no reason why
students have to take the word of
a chosen few elite that the men the
Publications Board is sending to
the EC are performing satisfactorily,
or even carrying out the wishes of
the student body.

There is an independent amend-
ment which will be coming up for a
vote in the coming general election.
It calls for the replacement of the
Publications Board representative to
the EC by another representative
from the junior class. In effect, it
calls for promotion of the demo-
cratic ideal and the democratic
actuality on this campus. It calls
for adherence to the belief that stu-
dent government is representative
government, and not the private do-
main of a chosen few.

This proposed amendment puts a
responsibility on every student who
has the power to vote. Can you
stand idly by and let this amend-
ment not be passed, without assum-
ing the blame for what will be a
defeat for each and every individ-
ual?

 

Bibb Highlights
Spring Concerts

By BILL ATWELL

The Meg Wells group had a dif-
ficult Friday night at Washington
and Lee. The basic reason for this
seems to be that Miss Wells and
Friends are trying to perform an
avant guarde brand of folk music
that either won’t work or isn’t per-
fected. Perhaps I am outdated but
I prefer my folk music without ex-
cursions into jazz and classical mu-
sic. There seems to be no valid rea-
son for incorporating the three. Each
is perfectly capable of standing alone
and I never have been intrigued by
newness for newness’ sake.

I must admit the group had a try-
ing time with acoustics. Doremus
Gymnasium does not lend itself
easily to the subtleties of sound
the group was trying to achieve.
They would have been a far more
effective organization in Lee Chapel
before 300 or so people.

The things I didn’t like about the
performance stem generally from the
above, so I will discuss what did
please me.

Meg Had Pitch

First of all I feel it must be said
that all the musicians were ac-
complished. Miss Wells herself had
very good pitch and knew exactly
what she was doing at all times.

The best tune the group did was
Heads or Tails (I’m still not sure if
Miss Wells had tongue-in-cheek
when she said it came from the
French Revolution). This piece was a
harmonized wordless duet with clar-
inet.

Prelude to Panic and the Dance of
Deaths created quite a bit of in-
tensity and both had good jazz
solos by Vie Holland. The shifting
of musical effects left me cold
however.

I guess the only thing left to say
is that it was a nice try and better
luck next time around.

Leon Bibb

When the performers for the
Spring Concerts were announced,
one question was asked all over
campus: “Who in the hell is Leon
Bibb?” Anyone who heard him sing
Friday night will never ask that
question again.

Bibb and his guitarist were the
best of the three groups that ap-
peared. After the Wells aggregation
it was a pleasure to hear somebody
sing—and sing Mr. Bibb did. His
deep, clear voice was amazing to
hear; for with no microphone he
filled the gym with seemingly little
effort.

Everything he did was immensely
enjoyable. Without any reservations
I will say that his version of West
Side Story’s Maria was one of the
best vocal selections to come along
in quite a while. Bibb seemed to
have great feelings for the song.

Both Good Morning Captain and
Didn’t It Rain were particularly
pleasing to the audience. On both
of these selections I noticed a very
close similarity to the Harry Bela-
fonte of Belafonte’s Mark Twain
days.

I’m sorry I didn’t catch Bibb’s ac-
companist’s name for he was truly a
sensitive, polished guitarist. Bibb’s
jokes and off-hand patter were ef-
fective and he brought his show to
a fine climax with Rocks and Gravel.
Those of you who are familiar with
Cannonball Adderly might notice

Far Eastern Sketches

 

Tokyo: A Magnificent Marriage Of The East and West

(Editor’s Note: This is the first of
two sketches of great cities of the
Far East by Peter Lee, a 1960 gradu-
ate of Washington and Lee, and
the editor of the Tuesday Edition of
The Ring-tum Phi in 1958-1959. He
has been in Korea since August 1961
with the Army and prepared these
sketches for The Ring-tum Phi on
leave in the Far East.)

By PETER LEE

TOKYO—A few yards from the
noise and dynamism of Tokyo's fi-
nancial and commercial centers is
the tranquil and ageless Imperial
Palace. The contrast is pervasive
throughout the city and the island
empire. This city is the nerve center
of one of the world’s most active,
growing economies and at once a
flamboyant and magnificent example
of the marriage of East and West.

The traditional Japanese farmer
and fisherman may be seen from a
modern fast train from Yokohama.
Their dress, their surroundings, their
techniques demonstrate dramatically
that Japan is a nation of tension.
Large segments of the population
live as their ancestors, and suffer
as their ancestors did from the ef-
fects of a feudal system. This sor-

 

did heritage of the East, though, is
succumbing to the economic equal-
ization wrought by the industrial
revolution in Japan. But Japan is
still in the process of entering the
Twentieth Century, and the tension
between the Old and New, the East
and West is present in the customs,
the politics and the culture of the
people.

The city of Tokyo astonishes a vis-
itor first of all by its sheer size.
There are not too many skyscrapers
as we know them, so one can see
great distances unimpeded by large
buildings. For mile after mile, the
city gives the impression of a great,
moving, buzzing anthill.

An Image of Movement

There are, of course, striking and
disturbing contrasts between the an-
cient, poor villager and the sauve,
intelligent Tokyo businessman. But
the contrasts are neither as numer-
ous nor as frustrating as one wit-
nesses in other areas of the Far East.
Here, while the contrasts may be
disturbing, the total image is one of
movement. In Tokyo everything is
moving, from the terrifying taxicabs
to the bumping, grinding strippers
in the burlesque houses. And while

 

the movement may be erratic, taste-
less in some areas, and hectic in
others, there is nevertheless a total
growth and movement towards the
prosperity of Western Democracies.

The Ginza, advertised by the trav-
el brouchures as Toyko’s combina-
tion of Fifth Avenue and Broadway,
deserves such boasts. It also deserves
a little of its reputation as a tourist
trap. There are dozens of fashion-
able, reputable shops, dealing in
everything from Swiss watches to
British woolens to Hong Kong silks.
But there are also dozens of guady
shops designed to capture the imag-
ination and the pocketbook—of the
tourist. It’s easy to fall, too. Tape
recorders, stereo sets, transitor ra-

| dios appear astonishingly inexpen-

sive. In many cases, they are a little
less expensive than American
brands, and of equal or even superior
quality. But there are also inexpens-
ive imitations of reputable Japanese
and American brands that appear
attractive, but won’t last long.

The shops, the stalls, the street
salesmen of the Ginza, then, are not
unlike the wonderful mixture you
can find in any prosperous, booming
metropolis. The Ginza has—like New
York—the beautiful, the fashionable,

 

the gaudy, and the cheap. It has—
like New York—it’s share of con
men—and women.

Salesmanship with Courtesy

American merchants could learn
from their Japanese counterparts.
The Japanese department stores
have mastered the American talents
of salesmanship and showmanship
for an array of goods equal to near-
ly any American market. But they
have retained something of the cour-
tesy and elegance of traditional
Japan at its best. Salesgirls, trained
to sell, are also trained to treat
customers—and tourists—with re-
respect. As you step from the esca-
lator on each floor, a lovely young
Japanese girl bows graciously and
welcomes you to that particular de-
partment. The result is enchanting.
And, I’m sure, healthy for profits,
too.

A few blocks from the Ginza, the
evidence of movement in Japan is
not quite so obvious but perhaps
more lasting »d more convincing.
Here, in the vanking and business
district, the booming Japanese econ-
omy has its home base. Here the
great industrial complexes are plan-
ned and financed. Here the ambitious
plans—which have met with suc-

 

cess—for rapid expansion of world
trade are always undergoing revi-
sion.

Japan of Industry

Japan has been for the past sixty
years the most industrialized nation
in the Far East. But the revolution
since her disastrous defeat in World
War II has channeled the results of
industrialization away from the few
great cartels and into the growing
entrepreneur and worker classes.
Certainly, some of the great cartels
are still growing profitably. But
more and more, the industrialization
of Japan is changing the lives of the
ambitious, talented young men with
ideas and the workers as well. Be-
fore World War II, Japanese heavy
industry was designed to assist the
expansion of her imperial designs.
Military hardware and basic indus-
tries were emphasized at the ex-
pense of consumer goods.

Now, it is not uncommon for the
Japanese worker to own his home,
a television set and an electric range.
Certainly, this is not yet the image
of the average Japanese worker, but
there appears to be no reason why
it won’t be in a few short years. The
problem of Communist influence in
the labor and student movements
may well be solved by the rapid

 

elimination of economic injustice
which is now underway in Japan.

Western Influence

The Western influence in Japan
has assisted greatly the techniques
of her industrial reconstruction, the
structure of her democratic politics
and the development of greater per-
sonal freedom. But there are also
evidences of Western influences—
specifically and unmistakably Amer-
ican influence—that are sometimes
disturbing and often humorous.

Baseball, rock and roll, Coca Cola,
Western movies and the Twist are
all popular in Toyko. Beerhalls have
loudspeakers blaring forth the her-
itage of American culture onto the
streets, “Come on, baby let’s do the
twist.,..” New Frontiersmen visiting
Tokyo bars may be a little disturbed
over the Jackie influence in Japanese
women’s dress when they see the
streetgirls in pillbox hats and bouf-
fant coiffeures.

And along the Ginza, a classical
Japanese opera house of modest size
has room to spare, while hundreds of
Japanese are lined up in front of
Theatre Toyko, a gigantic building,
to see, in color, cinemascope, and in
Japanese, “Gone With the Wind.”

Top-Ranked Johns

Game Scheduled|

For Tomorrow

Washington and Lee’s varsity la-
crosse team, which is winless against
only moderately tough competition,

starts the tough part of their sched-| |

ule tomorrow with a game against
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.

The Hopkins team, subject of a
feature article in Sports Illustrated
magazine this week, is the toughest
of the tough. With a 12-8 victory
over Virginia under their belts, they
seem headed for another national
championship.

They are led by Captain Henry
Ciccarone and All-American At-
tackman Jerry Schmidt, both of
whom have already left their mark
on the W&L football team as well
as the local stickmen.

Coach Bob McHenry’s hopes for
a good showing against Hopkins are
hurt by the continued absence of
Bruce Jackson and Bob Van Rensel-
lear from the lineup with injuries.
But a fairly good performance
against Washington College last Sat-
urday has led the local partisans to
believe that the team may be pull-
ing out of their horrid spring-vaca-
tion slump.

Golfers Travel
To Williamsburg

Washington and Lee’s golf team
travels to Williamsburg Sunday for
a match against a strong William
and Mary team.

The Indians are probably the best
team the Generals will play in dual
competition this year.

William and Mary is 5-0 in match
play this year, including wins over
George Washington, VMI, and VPI, a
perennial state power in golf.

The Generals are 1-2 for the year,
having lost matches to Dartmouth
and Hampden-Sydney. The lone win
came against MIT.

With all six starters returning
from last year, W&L was expected to
field one of its finest teams in re-
cent years. But a combination of
bad weather and poor conditions on
the local course have kept the golf-
ers from getting enough practice.

Coach Cy Twombly has had his
boys on the course at least three
days this week in preparation for
the William and Mary match, and
feels that some of the boys are
finally beginning to come around.

Starters for the Generals against
W&M will probably be Jack Varda-
man, captain Grantham Couth, Will
Lee, Steve Henry, Ron Stewart, and

 

 

either Paul McBride or Warren
Hughes.

Two quick goals in the first quar-
ter of play gave the JV lacrosse team
the necessary margin for victory
over Augusta Military Academy at

score was soon followed by Mike
Brumby’s goal giving the Baby Gen-

second and third rounds will begin
at five and 7:30 respectively. A

A grandslam homerun by Rich-

to a 9-0 win over Washington and

Rideout, a standout footballer for
UR, hit his grandslammer in the
third inning off starter Brice Gam-

JV Lacrosse Team Over AMA

AMA scored its only goal in the
beginning of the second quarter,
but midfielder Syd Butler’s insur-
ance goal at the close of the half

stopped the rally and ended the
scoring.

Coach Swan singled out goalie
John Moore and defenseman Bo
Earnest and Chuck Long for their
fine defensive game as well as
the scorers.

Swan went on to say that he
thought that the team played very
well despite having only two play-
ers with any experience on _ his
twenty-man squad, and the team’s
lack of practice time created by the
bad weather and spring vacation.

Swan said “the team made up
for their lack of experience with
hustle and, consequently, we came
out on top.”

The varsity lacrosse team goes
after its first win of the season
against a very strong John Hopkins
team on Saturday, without the ser-
vices of Bob Van Rensallaer and
Bruce Jackson. Both are still recov-
ering from leg injuries.

Atwood Explains

Faculty Position

(Continued from page 1)

Dean Atwood said that this origi-
nal proposal, made last year with
the IFC’s having full knowledge of
its existence, was voted down by the
fraternity committee, which suggest-
ed that the social functions commit-
tee do extensive research on how
other schools have solved similar
problems.

Among those schools, six in num-
ber, were Amherst and Sewanee.
Dean Atwood couldn’t think of the
others, and Dr. Cook wasn’t avail-
able for information.

This year, the IFC was requested
to formulate a plan for solving the
conflict. The first idea was to elimi-
nate Friday night combos on dance
week-ends, and this was defeated
9-7 in the IFC.

The second plan was the well-
known and latest IFC proposal,
calling for closed house parties dur-
ing dance week-ends if there was
conflict.

The IFC passed this proposal and
put it into its constitution.

Last Monday, the fraternity com-
mittee met with the Social Func-
tions Committee and heard the re-
port on the investigation of other
schools. Both IFC president Bob
Doenges and dance board president
Steve Galef were present at this
meeting.

Having heard Doenges’ arguments
for the IFC plans, the Social Func-
tions Committee once again brought
up its plan for abolishing fraternity
combos during University social
functions.

This time it passed.

Dean Atwood said that the com-
mittee’s decision had “absolutely
nothing to do with a de-emphasiza-
tion of fraternities on campus.”

“T can think of only one professor
on campus who’s for the abolition
of fraternities, and I can assure you
he’s a minority of one,” he said.

He defended the Social Functions
Committee, who drew up the up-
popular proposal, saying that “the
committee has gone along with the
desires of the student body as much
as possible.”

“We've just about reached the
point where we can say, ‘If you don’t
want dances, don’t have them’.”

Texas Senator Visits W&L

To Discuss Republicanism

three, Craig Distlehorst_

The number of Texas students
at W&lL was, according to Hyatt,
another aid in getting Tower to
come. Texas students will give a
reception for the Senator while he
is on campus.

Tower was elected in a May run-
off to refill the seat vacated by
Vice President Lyndon Johnson. At
the time of his election he was the
youngest Senator in the 87th Con-
gress.

Sen. Tower was named in Febru-
ary to the six-man Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee. He
is a member of the Senate Banking
and Currency and the Labor and
Public Welfare committees, and is
one of four Senators on the Civil
War Centennial Commission.

 

takes of a year they would rather
forget, University Party politicos
are getting their campaigns off the
ground in a hurry.

Ireland, Boardman, and Butler to-
day released a nine-plank party
platform (see story, this page).

In it, they promised a more ac-
tive program of freshman assimila-
tion, the creation of new freshman
class officers, more liberal placing of
freshmen on University student
committees, better facilities for cov-
erage of EC meetings by the press,
and the improving of student-town
relations.

But the most important and unex-
pected planks on the platform have
to do with changes on the structure
and function of the Executive Com-
mittee, an organization largely con-
trolled by members of the Univer-
sity party in past years.

The new Big Three candidates
pledged support of Roy Goodwin’s
amendment to the student body con-
stitution, and also said they were
for eliminating the Publications
Board representative to the EC.

And they topped off the platform
by promising to “preserve fraternity
autonomy, this including active op-
position to the recent faculty de-
cision to eliminate fraternity enter-
tainment during University Dance
Functions ”

Opinion On Faculty Action
(Continued from page 2)

excesses were the sole objectives of
the faculty, why hit dance week-
ends? A much more important area
of concern is Hell Week. Surely
this is a problem that should be
worked out and which has more
significance than kicking the Five
Royales out of Red Square for a
few hours four times a year.

Those of us who feel the fraternity
contributes a positive good to the
development of the “whole man”
should scrutinize carefully the posi-
tion the fraternity is in. Then the
decision must be made to either
work diligently and actively to im-
prove that position or to await with
frustrated helplessness the not-so-
eventual extinction of the Greek let-
ter social fraternity at Washington
and Lee.

the resemblance between this tune
and Adderly’s Work Song. Both
were inspired by road gang songs.

I am sure many Washington and
Lee students became Leon Bibb fans
last weekend. The list is sure to
grow in the future.

Whiskey Hill Singers

Saturday the concert-goers were
greeted with a pure dose of profes-
sionalism. The Whiskeyhill Singers,
under the leadership of Dave Guard,
put on an extremely entertaining
show. The group was obviously well
rehearsed and, what’s more, they
showed real enjoyment for their
work.

The greatest asset to the group
was girl singer Judy Henske. She
has a remarkable voice complete
with growls, yells, etc. One might
be surprised to learn she was trained
in opera.

 

Well Received

The group sang a number of crowd
pleasers, including Railroad Bill and
Miss Henske’s version of Nobody
Knows You When You’re Down and
Out. The real treat of the night for
me, however, was Woody Guthrie’s
Deportees.

Some people wondered why Dave
Guard walked out on the Kingston
Trio and all that money. From the
looks of things this group will be
just as big a success. The members
won't go hungry, you can bet.

The folk music craze has been tak-
ing the country by storm in the
last few years. W&L is no exception.
The concerts were well-attended and
greatly enjoyed by the student body.
I for one hope this type of program
will continue in the future.

NOTICE
A Marine Officer Selection will be
on the W&L campus next Tuesday
to interview students.

INDEPENDENTS SELECT CANDIDATES

PAYNE-CHRISTIAN-LANE SEEK BIG THREE POSITIONS

By STEVE GUILD
Executive News Editor

The Independent Party announced
last night its slate of candidates for
the “Big Seven” offices of the stu-
dent body. The formal announce-
ment of the candidates came at last
night’s nominating convention in Lee
Chapel, although the candidates had
been selected at a series of party
“clique” meetings during the past
week.

Nominated for president of the
student body was Bob Payne, Delt
junior from Louisville, Kentucky.

 

Bob Payne

Candidates Officially Nominated
In Lee Chapel Convention

By KEN LANE
Associate Editor

The slates of the University and
Independent parties were officially
presented last night in a convention
that will go down in the annals of
Washington and Lee University.

Marking the University’s last
nominating convention, this year’s
convocation will serve as a memor-
able signpost in the political history
of W&L.

For if the new EC constitution is
ratified by the student body at the
polls this Thursday, and by all pre-
dictions this is what will happen,
then what has become a merely per-
functory ceremony will be perman-
ently blotted out of succeeding elec-
tions. :

None the less significant were
the candidates nominated for the
two parties, promising a closely
matched campaign all along the
line.

The slate for the University party
is as follows: Tim Ireland, PiKA, for

Dance Board
To Sponsor Poll

In an effort to feel out the
tastes of the student body as a
whole, the Dance Board is
sponsoring a poll to be includ-
ed on the election ballot this
Thursday. The poll will con-
cern next year’s dance sets, in
particular Fancy Dress and
Springs.

The first question asks: For the
Fancy Dress Ball next year would
you be in favor of (1) the tradi-
tional costume ball or (2) the full-
dress “High Society” ball similar
to the one held this year.

Secondly, would you be in favor
of an invitational “Folk Festival” to
be held here next Spring in which
a professional group would perform
Friday night and judge several ama-
teur groups that would perform
Saturday night. A final question al-
lows students to list their four fav-
orite entertainment groups as sug-
gestions for next year.

Frank Young, president-elect of
the Dance Board, is hopeful of posi-
tive results from the poll. Comment-
ing on the idea of an invitational
folk festival, he stated that “there
has been a rising interest in this
tradition and there are various ama-
teur groups all over the country
who offer talent comparable to the
highest paid entertainers.”

 

 

 

Running with Payne will be Meade
Christian, vice-president, and Chuck
Lane, secretary.

Nomination Speeches

Among the impressive nominating

speeches presented were those of

 

Rosie Page, Steve Suttle, and Robin
Wood. Rosie forcefully spoke out
against an attack on Tim Ireland as
“riding the gravey-train” to office.

Steve Suttle aroused a few chuck-
les in his eulogy paid to the chair-
man of the convention, Bll Outman.
Robin Wood struck home for his
candidates by relating a knee-slap-
ping anecdote.

The convention was also the
scene for a dramatic demonstra-
tion. During the course of the
proceedings, the entire non-fra-
ternity delegation rose from their
seats and marched en masse out of
the convention leaving a notice-
able vacuum in the middle of Lee
Chapel.

A spokesman for the group later
explained that the act was meant to
remind the two parties of its repre-
sentation as a considerable segment
of the voting power.

 

Candidates Express Views
At Student-Held Forum

By JACK DEJARNETTE

Writer

“Increased freshman representation on student body com-
mittees will give desired and necessary experience as well as

pointing out to some extent the l
said Tim Ireland in last night’s*
forum following the student body
nominating convention.

In reply to this statement, Meade
Christian, Independent Pary candi-
date for Vice President said that he
did not feel that this would be in
the best interest of the University
or of the Freshman class because he
felt that they would not have been
sufficiently assimilated during the
first part of their first year to be of
real service to the University. He
pointed out the fact that he had
spent six months on the Executive
Committee this year before he felt
qualified to speak out strongly in
that committee’s affairs.

Both parties seemed to feel that
assimilation and _ student-faculty
relationships are the basic issues of
this year’s campaign. Bob Payne, In-
dependent Party candidate for
president, felt, “This assimilation can
be properly accomplished by the
end of the first term so that Fresh-
men will be qualified to assume
various responsibilities by the sec-
ond semester of their freshman
year.”

In what might have been a move
to ward off a heated debate, Payne
opened his remarks with an apolo-

 

eaders in each freshman class,”

 

gy to Lanny Butler and the Univer-
sity Party for the use of the word
“hypocritical” in a statement which
the Independent Party issued last
Saturday morning.

Each candidate was asked to say
why he thought himself qualified
for the particular post for which he
was running.

Chuck Lane said that he thought
that he had the qualifications, the
time, and the fresh blood which
would be beneficial to the student
body. He also added that he did not
believe that experience on th Ex-
ecutive Committee was a necessary
qualification for holding an office.

Butler felt the experience which
he has gained on the staff of the
Ring-tum Phi has kept him in close

that this was something to be de-
sired.

Meade Christian thought his ex-
perience on the EC this year was in-
valuable. He also stressed the fact
that he would devote his greatest
energies to doing a good job as Vice
President. Said Christian, “I feel that

Independent Party Publishes

Platform For Coming Election

THE PLATFORM

1. We support the new constitution
ratified by the EC, which would pro-
vide, in particular, for a petition pro-
cedure to replace the nominating
convention as the method of nomi-
nating candidates ;and for assump-
tion by officers of the senior, junior,
and sophomore class, of the responsi-
bilities now held by presidents of
Finals, Openings, and Spring Dances,
respectively.

We favor these changes: (a)
because the new method of nomi-
nation would be more democratic,
allowing for the nomination of more
than two candidates; and (b) be-
cause the positions of class officers
would be given meaning and pur-
pose, the expensive and wasteful
practice of fraternity-financed par-
ties in honor of the dance-set pres-
idents would be abolished, and class
unity would be strengthened
through an essentially class activity.

 

2. The Independent Party spon-
sored petition to replace the Publi-
cations Board representative to the
EC with a second junior class rep-
resentative.

3. The Sigma Delta Chi-sponsored
petition to open legislative meetings
of the EC to representatives from

 

the student press.

contact with the student body, and |

would be neglecting its duty to the
student electorate if it failed to sup-
port in practice these basic tenets.

4. The election of the President of

| the IFC by student-wide fraternity |

voting.

This step is toward greater de-
|mocracy. Therefore, we support it.
But it is also part of our desire to

be affirmative in our actions, to sup- |
| port the IFC, to further the course }

of fraternity-faculty relations, and
especially to improve the social life
of the student body, in the best sense
of the word.

5. A program to promote greater
cooperation between the EC and the
dormitory counselors in explaining
and interpreting the Honor System
and student government institutions
to the freshmen.

The need for heightened activity
with regard to assimilating incoming
freshmen to our way of life here at
W&L is painfully acute. We feel that
we have the solution to the problem.
It is a concrete program we pro-
pose, whereby dorm counselors who
are in the best positions to do so
will work with the EC to promote
understanding and knowledge, with
special attention to the Honor Sys-
tem.

Student Body Address

As an extension of this policy,
we support the adoption of an an-
nual practice which might be term-
ed, “The State of the Student Body
Address,’ whereby the President of
the Executive Committee would pre-
sent at a general student body as-
sembly the facts of his administra-
tion, the typical problems facing stu-
dent government and the student
body, and so on.

 

These are the planks of our plat-
form. We believe sincerely in what
we have proposed. Whether or not
| they are original suggestions is un-
important, compared to our deter-
imination if elected, to carry
| promises out.

The Independent Party issued a
statement of their platform on Fri-
day morning as did the University
Party in Friday’s Ring-tum Phi.
Both platforms, as it stands now,
contain essentially the same points.
The University Party has proposed
freshman class officers and positions
on committees, while the Indepen-
dent Party has taken issue with it in
the enlarged statement of purpose
(See elsewhere on this page) which
was issued this morning.

The Independent Party has also
proposed a state of the student body
address to be delivered by the pres-
ident of the student body in an an-
nual assembly.

Both Parties’ “Big Three” candi-
dates will participate in an Execu-
tive Committee-sponsored assembly
period on the current issues in
duPont Auditorium at 7:00 on
Wednesday night. At this meeting
the candidates will present views
in prepared speeches and afterwards
the floor will be open for questions.

New Calyx
To Arrive
Next Week

The 1962 Calyx will prob-
ably be distributed to the stu-
dent body during the first part
of next week, announced edi-
tor Joe Goldstein today. Gold-
stein said the theme of the
yearbook is ‘“The Washington
and Lee Swings.”

 

The Calyx will be shipped from
the printer Friday and will be dis-
tributed from the Student Union
upon arrival.

The 1962 yearbook will be dedicat-
ed to “two of the younger members
of the faculty,” who “represent the
progressive course that our Uni-
versity has pursued during the past
few years.” In effect, said Gold-
stein, these two symbolize the spirit
of the W&L Swing.

To carry out the theme, various
lines from the song will be used in
illustrating the seven phases of
life depicted. The first line, “When
Washington and Lee’s men fall in
line...” will be associated with the
Class section; the Social Fraternity
section will feature “...Roll old
Sweet Briar on the Sod!”

Major innovations in the annual
this year include a two-page color
spread, the first in several years.

For the first time, the Board of
Trustees will be included in the
book. The group faculty picture is
eliminated and six pages are devoted
to the faculty, with the heads of the
18 academic departments featured in
individual candid shots.

All pictures in the book indentified
with captions and all activities will
be given write-ups as to their pur-
pose, function, ete.

Honorary fraternities will be giv-
en a separate section this year to

 

our |

play up the eight honor groups on
campus.

Other changed sections include
fraternities, Beauty Court, freshman

| sports, and football.

Goldstein attributed the early

| publication of the Calyx largely to

the efforts of Herb Salomon and

Union | Bob Payne, managing editors, and

Robin Wood, business manager.

Students Should Vote Wisely
In Campus Elections Thursday

It is encouraging to the Tuesday Edition that leaders of
both campus political parties have chosen to endorse the amend-
ment to the Student Body Constitution which would guarantee
press representation at the Executive Committee’s legislative
meetings.

 

As we said in an editorial last week, we feel that the campus
press should be given constitutional protection of its inherent
right to be present at legislative meetings of the EC.

It would seem that since both parties have expressed their
approval of the idea, the matter virtually has already been
decided.

The matter cannot be decided, however, until the Student
Body by its vote passes the amendment. Each and every mem-
ber of the Student Body will have their chance to vote on this
matter, and other important matters this Thursday.

We sincerely hope that this election won’t be marred by a
poor turnout at the polls, and that the students will familarize
themselves with the proposed Constitutions, the candidates, and
the amendments so that they can cast intelligent votes.

Eliminate Mud Slinging,
Put Emphasis On Issues

Once again, the campus is overrun with campaign posters
of the two political parties. However, this campaign that is be-
ing waged this year is a far cry from the one that took place
a year ago.

Both parties have presented their candidates and both
have presented their platforms. It is interesting to note that
the platforms of the two groups are remarkably similar. Both
stand for good government, and both support the much talked
about changes in the student body constitution. Neither party
has come up with anything truly new and different.

It appears that this year’s elections will be a repetition of
the old party politics of the past. The several positigns will go
to the party with the most members. Thus, for all practical
purposes, the election virtually is decided before it is run.

However, it is unfortunate to see the mud throwing and
back stabbing that both parties have been engaged in. Both
parties have nominated able candidates and any of these can-
didates can serve well. Therefore, it is wholly unnecessary to
draw attention away from what issues there are with such moves.

While we realize that a degree of this is always associated
with politics, it is our feeling that more emphasis should be
placed on the issues themselves and not on petty matters of
little concern.

—G. A. N.

Cocktail Party Should Remain

A long standing tradition of dance sets at Washington and
Lee is the cocktail party that is sponsored by the president of
the dance set’s fraternity. While this may be a luxurious waste
of money, it is a definite part of our traditions.

The new Student Body Constitution will place the class
presidents in charge of the dance sets. What will happen to the
cocktail party? Will it become, like many of our traditions, a
thing of the past?

There are two possible solutions to the matter. One is that
the fraternity of the class president could continue to sponsor
the cocktail party. However, a second and more practical solu-
tion would be to distribute the cost of the cocktail party over
the respective class.

The advantages of distributing the cost of the cocktail party
over an entire class are many. It would ease the financial bur-
den of all concerned. Further, it would help to promote a
larger measure of class unity as each member of the class would
have an interest. Finally, it would give the other class officers a
long needed function.

No matter what plan is adopted, we hope that the traditional
cocktail party will remain one of our traditions and not become
a thing of the past.

Respectfully

A Freshman

While I showed last week that
there is some justification for the
faculty move in their eyes, there
seems to be little justification from
the student point of view

The action brings to mind Wood-
row Wilson’s statement about “a
little group of willful men” who
thwarted the will of the majority.

The IFC tried strong action and
the students rejected it. The IFC
tried a more acceptable compromise
and the faculty rejected it. Such a
position is too close to being impos-
sible to expect very much of the
IFC unless the representatives can
be given a free hand to vote as they
personally see fit.

Back to the question at hand, how-
ever, there is very little the student |
body can do except bemoan the |
faculty committee action—at least |
at this time. However, there is a
day coming when we “down-trod-
den” undergraduates will become
alumni, and then we can show our
due appreciation.

* ye *

I CAN not bring myself to be-,
lieve that Washington and Lee has
gone anti-fraternity. It is very true
that a vocal minority on the faculty
holds such sentiments, but it would
be interesting to see what the vote
would have been if the entire fac-
ulty had voted on the social com-
mittee’s resolution.

* ee ft

I ALSO wonder about the real
merit of keeping candidates for stu-
dent body offices out of the dorm.
Freshmen often do not know the}
candidates very well anyway, and
campaigning in the dorms gives
them some idea what these men are
really like. The object of such a
move apparently is grounded in |
merit, but the alternative of having
the candidates campaign where they |
please seems to be in the better in- |
terest of the student body as a
whole.

Faculty Action Not Good
In Eyes Of Student Body

 

3 New
Proposals
On Ballot

In addition to the Executive Com-
mittee’s proposed new constitution,
three other amendments will appear
on the ballot in Thursday’s student
body elections.

The EC constitution has been ap-
proved by a two-thirds vote of the
EC and will require only a majority
vote from the student body to be
approved The other three amend-
ments were presented by student
petition and will require a_ two-
thirds majority vote from the stu-
dent body to be approved.

There will be another entirely new
constitution presented by the editors
of Pretest. This document will set
up the posts of “advisor” to the ac-
cused, and “examiner” in Honor
trials. Ben Brown, one of the Pro-
test editors, says this arrangement
will create a better psychological
atmosphere at trials.

The Protest constitution also pro-
vides for a student senate, which will

Of course everyone these days is
talking about faculty interference
in student social affairs, and how it
it is none of their “damn” business
what we do on Saturday nights—
especially the Saturday night of
dance weekends.

All of this talk is good, I think,
for it now shows that W&L students
are not really apathetic. And it does
broaden the dinner-table conversa-
tion just a little bit.

But as for all the talk I’ve heard
about the latest move of “the
Hill,” the faculty seems to be
getting the short end of the stick.
I've yet to hear anybody come out
in support of the combo-crush-
ing action, at least come out in
public. This should not be.

Many times over the course of the |
past two years I have taken the
side of the faculty during similar

these wise men know far better how
students can most beneficially spend
their time and money. After all, if
we don’t question them in the class-
room, why should we do so outside?

Despite my wholehearted support
of their latest move, several points
are troubling me about this decision.
Chief among these is the appearance
that these faculty committees seem
to prefer to work in slow steps
rather than take an occasional bold,
daring, and exciting leap. For ex-
ample:

One of the biggest reasons given
to support the combo ruling was

for entertainment in two places (the
dandy gym and the sweaty fraternity
house) when they can only physical-
ly be in one. Now I thought the IFC
had a pretty good solution to this
plan when it suggested that frater-
nities couldn’t compel a member to
pay for a combo if he was going to
the dance. It seems that the faculty
could have incorporated this sugges-
tion into their ruling, and have it
read something like this:

conflict with baser forms of enter-
tainment imported by student fra-
ternal organizations;

social functions are

“Whereas faculty

more than their fraternity counter-
parts;

“Whereas decline of said Univer-
sity functions would leave a void
in faculty social life;

“Whereas students are paying
ing for both forms of entertain-
ment;

“Be it resolved that students
cannot pay for entertainment until
said University functions are com-
pleted.

“Let it also be stated that this
resolution solves not only the finan-
cial problem of the more proverty-
stricken among the student body,
but it also—as a by-product of leg-
islation—guarantees the continuance
of a healthy form of social activity

for the faculty.”
This sort of logic justifies “the
Hill’s” action of several weeks ago,

and I think no one ean argue against
it. It also provides the basis for some
action which I think should be taken
in the future, hopefully soon. At
least as soon as an investigation war-
rants it.

I'm speaking, of course, of the
disparity of fraternity house meals
with the likes of some members.
For example, my particular frater-
nity sometimes serves fish on Fri-
days.

 

members en-.. |

Now there’s no real reason for this,
but it’s always been done so I don’t
feel I have the right to question it
But I do feel that the faculty could
come in and rule that everyone who
doesn’t like fish on Fridays only has
to pay for peanut-butter and jelly.

That way I get what I want for
lunch, I don’t have to pay for what
I don’t want, and the faculty can
point with pride to another decisive
action which alleviates another one
of those situations termed by Dean
Atwood last Friday as “unhealthy
for the general interest of the stu-
dent body.”

In closing I want to make it again
| clear that I applaud the faculty ac-
tion as another milestone in Uni-
versity policy. I look forward to the
day when the coat-of-arms will be
required on blue blazers (like in
prep school), instead of being just
optional equipment to be adopted on
the whim of the individual.

In this way the school will be
making another “bold step forward.”

Another amendment would re-

class representative. A similar pro-
posal failed by only one vote of
being included in the EC’s proposed
constitution. Both parties have al-
ready come out in favor of such
an amendment.

A third amendment, sponsored by
Sigma Delta Chi, professional jour-
nalism fraternity, and the Tuesday
edition of the Ring-tum Phi, would
require the EC to open all meetings
to the “recognized campus press,”
except where the committee decided
by a majority veto to go into ex-
ecutive session, thereby excluding
reporters. This amendment is also
backed in the University Party plat-
form.

Student Body Secretary Steve
Suttle asked the student body today
o “please read the amendments and
be familiar with them_”

A further issue was brought up
about re-emphasizing the program
of freshmen assimilation into the
university. The two parties both
favor a more concentrated effort
among upperclassmen to impress on
incoming classes the importance of
assuming our traditional regulations
and conventions that are currently
suffering from lack of support.

Glee Club
Will Perform
Wendesday

The Washington and Lee Glee
Club will present its last on-campus
concert of the year Wednesday at
8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

From their repertoire ranging
from original compositions to popu-
lar show music and ballads, the
Glee Club and the John A. Graham
Brass Choir will join their efforts
under the direction of Mr. Robert
Stewart.

John Baker, baritone, will be the
featured soloist. Baker, an SAE
sophomore from Suffolk, Virginia,
also sings with the Sazeracs.

The Glee Club has added several
new selections to its program for
this concert. Among these are: “Con-
ceited,” a burlesque featuring a vo-
cal quartet with the Glee Club;
“Echo Song,” an antiphonal compo-
sition by di Lasso; and a new ar-
rangement of “Tom Dooley.”

Sam Channel, Phi Kap junior, will
be soloist in another new song, the

 

folk song, “Turtle Dove.” John
Baker will sing the solo part in
“Black is the Color of My True
Love’s Hair,”another folk song.

The Brass Choir will perform two

compositions written by Mr Stew-
art especially for the group: “Con-
zona” and “Divertissement.” The

group will also perform two marches

of the American Revolution, “On the
Banks of the Swale” and “Shellpott
Hill.” Other selections are “Conzona,
No. 2” by Gabriele and “Mirror of

noke has been the popular strip,
but the lack of traction and poor
organization has turned our com-
petitors to other tracks.

Nick Smith, with his 390 h.p., 406
cubic inch Ford Galaxie, brought
back from Concord, North Carolina,
his first trophy of the season in A
stock competition. His winning time
was 101:12 m.p.h. in 14 seconds fiat.

Kenny Beall, in his Sunbeam Al-
phine, won the sports car trophy
several weeks ago in Roanoke.

Since spring vacation a number
of new cars have appeared on
campus raising the prospective
number of drag racers for W&L.
Charles Stevenson has just ac-
quired a 360 h.p., fuel injection
Corvette with a four-speed gear-
box. Louis Mongeau has a 409
h.p. Chevrolet also with a four-
speed transmission,

Edge Jackson returned from spring
vacation with a 300 h.p. four speed
Corvette.

CRAM COURSE NO. 4: BATHYMETRY

Continuing our series of pre-final exam eram courses, today we

take up bathymetry —the study of ocean depths.

Admittedly, this is not a terribly popular course on most
campuses, And small wonder. In the whole world there is only
one bathyscape, and only two people can get into it.

Nevertheless, the study of ocean depths is of great impor-
tance. Why, do you realize that the ocean is by far the world’s
largest biological environment? The ocean has more than three
hundred times as much living room as all the continents and
islands combined! Unfortunately, only fishes live in it.

And small wonder. Who'd want to live some place where he
couldn’t smoke? Surely not I! I wouldn’t give up my good
Marlboro Cigarettes for the Atlantic and the Pacifie put to-
gether. Nothing could induce me to forego Marlboro’s fine
mellow flavor, Marlboro’s clean white filter, Marlboro’s flip-top
box that really flips, Marlboro’s soft pack that’s really soft.
Let others repair to the spacious deeps. Me, I will stick with
my Marlboros and the tiny garret I share with a tympanist.

But I digress. Back to the oceans. The largest, as we know,
is the Pacific, which was discovered by Balboa, a Spaniard of
great vision. To give you an idea of Balboa’s vision, he first
saw the Pacifie while standing on a peak in Darien, which is
in Connecticut.

Even more astounding, when Balboa reached San Franciseo,
he clearly saw the Hawaiian Islands! Being, as we know, a
friendly cuss, Balboa waved merrily to the Hawaiians and
shouted, “Great little ocean you got here, kids!’ The Hawaiians,
also, as we know, friendly cusses, waved back, declared a half
holiday, organized a luau, built a cheery fire over which they
prepared several gallons of poi, a suckling pig, and Captain
Cook. This, of course, was the origin of Cooking.

 

pupa

hod wat b lie the?

But I digress.
the deepest. The Mindanao Trench, off the Philippines, measures

The Pacific, I say, is the largest ocean and also
more than 5,000 fathoms in depth. (It should be pointed out
here that ocean depths are measured in fathoms—lengths of
six feet—after Sir Walter Fathom, a noted British sea measurer
of the seventeenth century who, upon his twenty-first birthday,
was given a string six feet long with which he used to go
scampering all over England measuring sea water until he was
arrested for loitering. A passion for measuring seems to have
run in the family; Fathom’s cousin, Sir Sol Furlong, spent all
his waking hours measuring race tracks until Charles II had
him beheaded in honor of the opening of the London Sehool of
Economics.)

But I digress. Let us, as the poet Masefield said, go down to
the seas again. (The seas, incidentally, have ever been a favorite
subject for poets and composers.) Who does not remember
Tennyson’s ‘Break, break, break’? Or Byron's “Roll on, thou
dark and deep blue ocean, roll’’? Or the many hearty sea chanties
that have enriched our folk music—songs like “Sailing Through
Kansas” and “Tl Swab Your Deck If You’ll Swab Mine” and
“The Artificial Respiration Polka.’’ My own favorite sea chanty
goes like this:

A girl loved a sailor and he did jilt her,

And she did weep and roar-ho!

Until she found a pe rfect filter,

Varlboro!

Sing hey, sing ho, sing ring-a-ding-ding,

And a perfect smoke

Sing tars and spars and patches,
Sing pack and box and lots to like,
And don’t forq t the matches!

I can to do something for Washing-
ton and Lee.”

Bill Boardman noted the fact that
the office of Vice President was a re-
sponsible and full-time one. He felt
that previous experience was de-
sirable but not necessary.

Bob Payne mentioned the fact
that in the present period of tran-
sition, a responsible leader is need-
ed for president. He said, “I have the
guts to take a stand for students’
rights.”

Proud of his six year association
with Washington and Lee, Ireland
felt his strong personal desire to
lead the university and its student
government would be a great asset
to him in performing the job of
president.

When asked for a general com-
ment about the campaign and elec-
tion, Payne said, “A vote for the In-
dependent Party is a vote for re-
sponsible and responsive govern-
ment. I feel it is the duty of each
student to consider with the greatest
sobriety the issues, candidates, and
election in general. I ask for their
support next Thursday.

Said Ireland, “I implore the stu-
dent body to take into considera-
tion the seriousness of the offices
for which they are casting their
votes. The responsibility is a great
one, but the broader platform which
the University Party offers is the
best, the only one for Washington
and Lee.”

SIPA This Year

To Feature

Hal Foster And James Reston

A two-day event aimed at improving scholastic publishing
gets underway here this Friday with the opening of the 33rd
annual Southern Interscholastic Press Association convention.

Although early registration of
some 1,100 delegates begins Thurs-
day afternoon, the crowded SIPA
agenda does not call for any work-
ing sessions until Friday morning.

James B. Reston, columnist and
head of the Washington Bureau
of The New York Times, and car-
toonist Harold R. Foster, creator
of “Prince Valiant” for King fea-
tures Syndicate, are featured
speakers for the convention.

Delegates and faculty advisors at
the convention will represent some
178 preparatory and high schools
from 10 Southern States and the
District of Columbia.

Entries in the annual awards com-
petition this year total 305. High-
light of the convention will be an
awards luncheon Saturday in Wash-
ington and Lee’s Doremus Gymna-
sium where 17 SIPA trophies in var-
ious categories of magazine, news-
paper, yearbook and radio work will
be given. Several trophies also will
be awarded.

The convention features short
courses in all aspects of secondary
school publishing along with work-
shops, criticism sessions, panel and
roundtable discussions and lectures
covering general publications topics.

Reston, who joined The New York
Times in its London Bureau in 1939,
will speak at 12:05 p.m. Friday in
Doremus Gymnasium. He will dis-
cuss “Kennedy’s Second Year” in a
public address. Returning to the
United States in 1941, Reston was
made assistant to New York Times
publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger in
1943, and later that year returned
to London as acting head of The
Times Bureau. In January, 1945, he
became national correspondent and

New Elections

For Collegian

Publications Board President
Ned Ames announced today that
there will be new elections for the
post of Editor of the 1962-63
Southern Collegian.

They will be held at 2:30 Thurs-
day afternoon in the Student
Union. They will be open to any
member of the student body who
falls within the eligibility rules.

This election is necessitated by
the disqualification of Bill Bowen

 

because of failure to fulfill the
academic requirements for this
position.

Notices

Applications are now being re-
ceived for the position of Vice Pres-
ident and Assistant Business Man-
ager of the Washington and Lee
Dance Board.

Applicants should apply in writing
to Frank Young, Box 438, Lexington,
Va., listing their qualifications and
proposals for the improvement of
Dance Board Programs. They will be
interviewed Monday, April 30, at 2:00
in the Student Union building. Writ-
ten applications should be received

their Student Proposed Constitution
is beyond any realization of practi-
cality.

For instances, they advocate a
student senate. The thing just won’t
work—it would be too unwieldly and
cumbersome due to the very size of
the thing, the personnel it would
probably attract would be of dubious
merit and qualification, and it would
be a dangerous instrument to our
traditions.

 

Glee Club To Sing

(Continued from page 2)
will present a concert at Hood Col-
lege, Frederick, Maryland. In addi-
tion to its regular concert selections,
the Club will combine with the
Hood College Glee Club for two
selections, the “Hallelujah Chorus”
and “The Heavens Are Telling.”

On Saturday, May 5, at Mary
Baldwin College, the Glee Club will
combine with the Mary Baldwin
Glee Club to stage Kurt Weill’s
“Down in the Valley.” Parts of the
score of the one act opera are based
on the American folk songs, “Down
in the Valley,’ “The Lonesome
Dove,” “The Little Black Train,”
“Hop Up, My Ladies,’ and Sour-
wood Mountain.”

Leading male roles will feature
John Baker as Brack Weaver, Phil
Booth as the Leader and Preacher,
and Scott Iacone as the Father.

It was brought out in the “con-
stitutional convention of last week
(there were at least 15 people
there) that a Student Senate had
been initiated at a Northern school
not so many years ago. One of its
first acts was to rescind their equi-
valent of the EC decision on a
point of honor. In a matter of two
years they had only the ruins of
an effective honor system left to
admire.

On that grounds alone the Student
Proposed Constitution is worthy of
a vote of no confidence Thursday.

Charlie Gummey, Steve Stull,

goalie Ray Miller was credited with
25 saves against the Hopkins attack.
All told, the Jays took 68 shots at
the Generals’ goal. W&L shot 16
times.

“I thought the boys gave as good
an effort as they could have,” Mc-
Henry said. “If we'd played this
we'd have beaten Loyola, Brown,

The team plays Saturday, against
the University of North Carolina.
“We plan to beat them,” McHenry
predicted. The only thing the coach
knows about the Tarheels is that
they beat Duke earlier in the sea-
son.

English Department | Announces
Chairman After Extended Search

The appointment of a new head of
the Department of English and three
other faculty additions were an-
nounced today by Dean William
Pusey.

Dr. Severn Parker Costin Duvall,
currently associate professor of Eng-
lish at Dartmouth College, will be-
come professor of English and head
of Washington and Lee’s English
program in September.

Other faculty appointments an-
nounced today included Dr. Harri-
son J. Pemberton, Jr., associate pro-
fessor of philosophy; Jefferson D.
Futch, instructor in history; and
John Nichols, instructor in mathe-
matics. All appointments are ef-
fective September 1, 1962.

Dr. Pemberton currently is an as-
sistant professor at the University of
Virginia. Futch is working toward
his Ph.D. degree at the Johns Hop-
kins University, while Nichols is
doing graduate work at the Univer-
sity of Virginia.

Dr. Duvall’s appointment fills a

 

vacancy in the Washington and Lee
faculty which developed when Dr.
Marvin B. Perry resigned as head
of the Department of English to be-
come Dean of Admissions at the Uni-
versity of Virginia.

Dr. Duvall, 38, is a native of Nor-
folk and a 1949 A.B. graduate of the
University of Virginia where he was
elected to membership in Phi Beta
Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa.
He received his M.A. and Ph.D. de-
grees from Princeton University in
1951 and 1955.

A scholar of literature in the
American South, Dr. Duvall taught
briefly at Princeton before joining
the Dartmouth faculty in 1953. In
1957-58, he was a Fulbright Visit-
ing Lecturer at the University of
Mainz in Germany. During World
War II and the Korean War he serv-
ed as an officer in the United States
Marine Corps.

Dr. Pemberton, 37, joined the Uni-
versity of Virginia faculty in 1954

after three years as an instructor
of philosophy at Yale University.
He received his B.A. degree in 1949
from Rollins College and his Ph.D.
degree in 1952 from Yale where he
was a resident fellow of Pierson
College.

During World War I, Dr. Pember-
ton was an army cartographer in
the Pacific. He is a native of Orlan-
do, Fla.

Futch, 30, a native of Baltimore,
received his B.A. degree from Johns
Hopkins in 1955. He has continued
toward his doctorate in European
History at Johns Hopkins as a
Woodrow Wilson Fellow and as a
teaching assistant. He is a veteran of
Army service in Italy.

Nichols, 28, a native of Norfolk,
received his B.S. degree at Hamp-
den-Sydney College in 1956. As a
member of the Naval Reserve he
taught mathematics and other sub-
jects for four years at the Bain-
bridge Naval Preparatory School.

U.S. Lagging
Claims Reston

Before SIPA

By STEVE SMITH

James B. Reston, nationally syndi-
cated New York Times columnist,
today told 1,100 high school journal-
ists in Doremus Gymnasium for the
SIPA meet that there is a lag be-
tween America’s “development of
institutions” and the “pace of his-
tory.”

Reston said the United States has
developed faster than any other
nation in history, and yet we “find
ourselves falling far behind in many
aspects.”

He emphasized the many changes
of this century, such as population
explosion, the westward movement
across America, automation, and the
new independence of young nations.

These changes have taken place

 

 

while the “decisive power” which
once rested in western Europe has
passed to the U.S. and the Soviet
| Union, the “least experienced” of

the great nations in the conduct of
foreign affairs.
As a result, Reston said, almost all |

| the activity in Washington today is|
part of the effort to “adjust to these
|enormous changes.” In spite of all}
| oficets. the changes have outrun the |
| adjustments.
Reston cited an example from the |
|time of the Eisenhower Doctrine
| which was passed for protection of
the Middle East. At the time of the
proposal of the Doctrine,

Conservatives
Plan Paper,
TV Appearance

By LARRY MEEKS

Wyatt Durrette, newly elected
president of the Conservative So-
ciety, announced last night that the
Conservatives will release the first
issue of a new paper tentatively
named “The Southern Conservative,”
during the latter part of next week.

Durrette described the paper as a
“journal of conservative opinion.’

The paper will be published each
month and distributed free. It will
be financed by contributions; there
will be no advertisements.

It will be sent out to all Virginia

colleges, several Virginia high
schools, and any other interested
groups.

Fifteen hundred copies of the first
issue will be printed and distributed,
and according to Durrette, “If it
meets with success, we hope to ex-
pand it in size and number.”

Elected with Durrette to serve the
remainder of this year and the first
semester of next year were Ned
Ames as vice president, Dan Balfour
as secretary, and Mike Sussman as
treasurer.

Durrette is a freshman law student
and president of his class. He did
his undergraduate work at VMI,
where he was president of his class
each year.

Recently a three-part article en-
titled “The Rise of Conservatism in
Western Virginia,” dealing with the
conservative movement at W&L and
two other schools, was published in
the Roanoke Times. As a result of
these articles, the group has been
asked to appear on a television |
program on May 8.

If plans work out, three members
of the Society will appear on the|
program. Brent Arthur, Joe Spivey, |
and Durrette have been named as
the three students.

Student Wit

Mason New, Frank Young,
Hot Nuts, Buddy Holley, and a flock
of other prominent entertainers
were mentioned as possible perform-
ers for next year in the Dance Board
poll conducted yesterday during
campus student body elections.

New was mentioned in one ballot
as a possible back-up man for Chuck
Berry. Young received support as a
guitarist for Leon Bibb.

The Hot Nuts were mentioned in
at least 100 ballots, but Buddy Hol-
ley received only a handful of votes.
Johnny Horton, the Big Bopper,
and Ritchie Valens were mentioned
on two ballots.

The only other student who re-
ceived support was campus conser-
vative Brent Arthur, who was first
choice on one ballot calling for
Arthur, Eleanor Roosevelt, and the
ADA singers.

Here are a few other sample bal-
lots:

Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, Roy
Acuff, Gene Autry, and Roy Rogers.

Leon Bibb, the Pope, and Liberace.

Rudy Vallee, Leonard Bernstein,
Ding Dong and the Bells.

One student wrote only one word
on his ballot, and that was APA-
THETIC in capital letters.

Another filled in the preference
blanks with two big words, FRA-
TERNITY COMBOS.

The only person who signed his
ballot was Worth Brown, who nom-
inated Arthur.

Record Turnout

A record turn-out at the polls pro-
duced what is perhaps the most sig-
nificant University Party victory
in recent years.

The only close race was for presi-
dent of Fancy Dress, where Ham
Emory defeated Roger Paine, 546 to
491, a 55-vote margin.

On all the other races, it was
strictly no contest. The University
Party had the candidates, got the
votes, and won the elections going
away. Things were as simple as that.

Ireland comfortably defeated Bob
Payne, 642-401 for the presidency;
Boardman defeated Meade Christian,
563-478 for the vice presidency; and
Butler defeated Chuck Lane, 635-
392 for the position of secretary.

Boardman Impressive

Butler and Ireland were clear fav-
orites during the entire political
campaign, but Boardman’s win may
have surprised a few people who
considered Christian the Indepen-
dent party’s brightest hope.

For many people, however, Board-
man’s victory was easily predictable.

Christian had earlier been men-
tioned as the strongest presidential
candidate in school, and his decision
not to run for student body president
may have hurt him seriously in his
attempt at the vice-presidency.

During the campaign, Christian
never seemed to take an active in-
terest in the election, a serious po-
litical mistake in a party that starts
off each race as an underdog.

Boardman, on the other hand, put
on probably the best campaign by a
University Party candidate in sev-
eral years, and his active interest
and intelligent political manipula-
tions paid off in the only “upset”
win of the elections.

With the exception of the Fancy
Dress race, all the University Party
candidates won easily. Supak de-
feated Mike Harris, 575-458; Croft
defeated Dan Balfour 627-404; and
Knight defeated Ross Kyger 568-
456.

No Upset in "62

As early as Tuesday, most people
were beginning to realize that this
year was not going to be another
1961, when the Independent Party
won four Big Seven positions in
the biggest political upset in W&L
history.

Ireland and Butler were already
established as strong favorites, and
sentiment for Boardman was begin-
ning to grow.

On Wednesday night, the Indepen-
dent party candidates made a public
appearance in the Commons, but re-
ceived few visible signs of support
from freshmen who appeared more

The policeman asked Stevenson

A Dreary

The elections are over. To the surprise of nobody who can
count, the University Party swept the boards. It wasn’t even

much of a campaign.

The platform plank which showed any originality at all
was the University Party’s stand for more freshman representa-

tion On campus committees.

Not that there wasn’t plenty to argue about. The Honor
system is still open to criticism and certainly needs more dis-
cussion in all respects. It seems remarkable to us that no candi-
date for a Big Three post chose to offer a delineation of his
personal feeling on the Honor System. It is even more remark-
able that none of the students who were so upset about the
Honor System last month chose to sound out the candidates. |
While nearly all of us agree on the basic principles of the
Honor System there is still plenty of room for disagreement

among ourselves. Differences

exist and we need very badly to give such differences a thorough

airing.

There is also need for student initiative in clearing up the
continued mess in the athletic department. We would like to
see the EC use their prestige to encourage some academic im-

provements in the University.

Ireland, Boardman, and Butler can provide strong and
creative leadership for the student body despite the lack luster
campaign. We congratulate them on their victory and wish

them luck.

ROTC Juniors In The Field
For Leadership Problem Series

Continuing with its program of in-
the-field application of classroom in-
struction, last week the ROTC De-
partment confronted its junior class
cadets with a series of leadership
reaction problems.

The course for this problem was
divided into five stations, each sta-
tion representing a new situation.
The cadets ran each problem in
groups of five with one of them des-
ignated as leader.

Control of the group was com-
pletely up to this particular cadet,
in order to test each member on his
leadership ability.

Members of the senior class were
given a chance to demonstrate their
acting ability by portraying indi-
viduals whom the patrols encounter-
ed and had to cope with.

A similar course will be adminis-
tered to the juniors at their summer
camp. By giving them an acquaint-
ance with the general problems in-
volved, they will have at least an
understanding of the requirements

 

to be placed on them in subsequent
tests and as actual leaders of func-
tioning units.

In the various problems, the groups
were forced to deal with a soldier
who panics and apparently goes ber-
serk in the face of the enemy, a
farmer who adamantly insists they
“get off his land,” captured and
wounded aggressor soldiers, and a
seriously wounded USS. soldier.

Each patrol is assigned a mission,
such as the destruction of an enemy
ammunition dump or finding electri-
cal equipment lost in a field. In at-
tempting to accomplish their mis-
sions they are met with surprise sit-
uations they must handle in addi-
tion to accomplishing the assigned
mission.

Enthusiastic participation on the
part of both juniors and seniors was
the key to the effectiveness of the
problems. This sort of involvement
was demonstrated in one incident
where the senior portraying the

The elections are over.

A furious, hectic week of hand-
shaking, arguing speculating and
planning has come and gone, leaving
a campus cluttered with useless
posters as the only physical sign of
its ever having been.

The effects of the week’s activities
will be far-reaching. The University
Party is once again in control, and
with it will come drastic innovations
in freshman assimilation; the Non-
fraternity Student have gained new
respect from the fraternity men in
both parties—for the Independent
Houses realize, certainly with frus-
tration, that the determining factor
in the UP victory was the almost-
solid support of the NFU’s. The Uni-

 

 

versity Party realizes this, too, and
chances are, they will remember it
when the non-fraternity men need
a favor.

What about the week itself? For
seniors, juniors, and even sopho-
mores, the terrific complexity of
Washington and Lee politics is old
hat.

The Freshmen Watched With Awe

But it’s a different story with the
freshmen. With a certain amount of
awe and bewilderment, we watched
as the wheels of party activity start-
ed rolling. The significance of party
ties became more clear, and we
watched—no one with complete un-
derstanding of what was happening—
as upperclassmen talked of “cliques”

objective thoughtfulness to the
sometimes emotional election.

Mud slinging gave the contest the
air of a public election, when one of
the two parties produced a profusion
of literature full of such words as
“hypocrisy”, “gravy train,” and “in-
sincerity.” Mostly, though, the dirt
was ignored and served only to make
things more comfortable.

By HOWARD SLATER

Leo Tolsty is considered by many
to be the greatest realistic novelist;
and at the root of his treatment of
realism was his belief that actions
and events are the proving ground
and the revelation of ideas and atti-
tudes.

Two simultaneous events in this
past hectic week, and the compara-
tive attendance at each of them, re-
vealed the prevailing attitude among
my fellow students. The two events
to which I refer were the Spring
Music Concert presented by the
Glee Club and The Brass Choir, and
a pre-election beer rally sponsored
by one of the student political par-
ties.

The first event, the concert, was
witnessed by a pitifully small au-
dience, despite excellent publicity,
worthy performers and a fine and
varied program. The second event,
the Beer Rally—it has been re-
ported; I am proud to say I was not
there—was a success in terms of the
amount of students which were at-
tracted to it.

Dear to Our Collective Heart

Here we have, it seems to me, a
perfect illustration of what Tolstoy

 

| SHH

 

———

meant by the revelation of attitudes

 

through events. The comparative at-
tendance at each of the functions is
a telling commentary on what the
student holds dear to its collective
and over-stimulated heart.

Let us take into account the fact
that even had there been no other
attraction, may students simply do
not care for the type of entertain-
ment offered at Lee Chapel Wednes-
day night. Let us also take into ac-
count the fact that there were men
at the Beer Rally drawn thiter by
purely political considerations.

Having made these allowances, it
is nonetheless true that student in-
terest in the campaign and election
was far from intense this year; and
it is both logical and reasonable to
assume, therefore, that the Beer Ral-
ly was aptly named. An excellent
example of the magnetism of beer.

Beer: a Thing of Value

This is what the student body has
illustrated to be one of its most
objects of value. It is not exactly
a revelation of a previously unknown
attitude, however. The point has
been made time and time again in
the past. The IFC, for instance, has
notoriously brief meetings; yet that
august body deliberated for over an
hour (and two meetings in a row

 

Proving Ground For Student Attitudes:
Beer Rally Conquers Spring Concert

at that) on the problem of when
and when not to have combos.

The incident which has most af-
fected the student body this year has
been the faculty decision to ban
combos for the entire evening on
which University society functions
occur. Big deal! This is quite an
issue to become upset about. What
unknown profundity lurks in the
hearts and minds of this seemingly
disinterested student mass.

‘A Sickness of Attitude’

But of course the most obnoxious
attitude of all is that which links
drinking with both manly and
gentlemanly virtues. The real man
in this kind of atmosphere, it seems
to me, is the one who makes a habit
of refusing to participate in this
dead-end method of achieving per-
sonal stature. Needless to say, the
veneration of drinking is represen-
tative of a wider sickness of atti-
tude—not because drinking is im-
moral in itself, but because of what
it has come to stand for among its
devotees.

It will be a profound relief, and no
regret at all for me when I enter
a sober and saner world; leaving be-
hind these half-hearted student guz-
zlers to stew in their own vomit.

 

Law School
Boasts Many

Achievements

By BILL ATWELL
The Washington and Lee Law
School seems sometimes to be treated
by the undergraduate student body
as more or less a distant relation to

the rest of the University.
This is a little puzzling when one
thinks of the integral part law
students play in the various facets

ijof W&L life. At the present time
‘| we have a law student as President

of the Student Body and by the time
this is printed another law student
will either have won or lost an
election for the same office.

Since law students have been en-
trusted with high office and respon-
sibility the undergraduate might en-

‘| joy learning a little more about the

Law School.

Lexington Law School

It had its origin in an institution
called the Lexington School of Law,
which was established by Judge
John W. Brockenbrough in 1849. In
1866, after General Lee had become
President of Washington College,
he invited Judge Brockenbrough’s
Law Classes to become affiliated
with the college and to meet in col-
lege buildings.

It is interesting to note that dur-
ing the following period the diplomas
given by the School of Law and
Equity at Washington College were
signed by General Lee as President,
as well as by Judge Brockenbrough.

On June 22, 1870, the School of
Law was Officially made one of the
regular Schools of the College.

The accomplishments of graduates
of the W&L Law School would fill
volumes; but I will limit myself to
discussing two of the most renowned.

Two prominent Law Graduates

The Late John W. Davis received
his B.A. from Washington and Lee
in 1892 and his LL.B from the School
of Law in 1895. He became Soliciter
General of the United States and
later U. S. Ambassador to Great
Britain.

Newton D. Baker received his
LL.B. in 1894 and went on to be
Secretary of War in Woodrow Wil-
son’s cabinet during World War I.

The names of these men are an
indelible part of the University to-
day, for Baker and Davis dormitories
are named for them.

The Washington and Lee School of
Law has also had four of its gradu-
ates serve as President of the Amer-
ican Bar Association. As Dean
Charles P. Light of the School of
Law said, “This is indeed a notable
record for a small institution.”

The Conflict of Student Government: A Faculty View

By JOHN M. GUNN, JR.

Student self-government in some
form is characteristic of almost all
American colleges and universities.
It is in the nature of student gov-
ernment for its form to change as
time passes and for its authority
to ebb and flow. Changes in the
nature and degree of self-govern-
ment by students cause recurrent
controversy in the nation’s univer-
sities. For the past four years the
controversy has been particularly
active at Washington and Lee.

Historically and currently, Wash-
ington and Lee students have been
privileged to self-government in an
unusual degree. This government,
of course, is subject to the ultimate
control of the faculty, to whom re-
sponsibility and authority for the
government of students is delegated
by the University’s Board of Trus-
tees. We may presume, however, that
the Trustees approve heartily—even
joyously—the transfer to students of
as much of this responsibility as they
are willing to assume.

 

The Role of Self-Government

Self-government is a proper and
significant part of a liberal educa-
tional experience. It contributes im-
measurably to development of stu-
dents as independent and responsible
citizens of a free society. It brings
to students for several years prior to
their adulthood some of the very
freedom, the enjoyment and preser-
vation of which a liberal education is
designed to make possible. It has the
incidental benefit of relieving mem-

bers of the faculty of regulatory |

chores.

Because students’ goverance of
themselves is sound educational pol-
icy, the faculty is willing, and in
truth it is anxious, to increase the
responsibility of the students for
their own regulation whenever stu-
dents show themselves able and will-
ing to accept and fulfill larger re-
sponsibility. To take a current ex-
ample, the Student Control Com-
mittee by its commendable perform-
ance had made it almost certain the

 

authority granted it on a trial basis

jurisdiction may well be extended.
will be renewed, and in time its

Authority Can’t Be Irrevocable

There is, however, a high correla-
tion between the amount of freedom
in government students may be per-
mitted to enjoy and the success of
their own government in advancing
their development. Since there is
never assurance of continuity in the
success of student self-government,
a grant of authority to students to
govern themselves cannot be irre-
vocable.

This is not to say that whenever
an organ of student government
makes a mistake it should lose its
authority. Indeed, the development-
al function of self-governance can
be fulfilled only if students have
opportunities to learn from their
mistakes, and there is little freedom
in a society unless there is freedom
to make mistakes. It is only when
student agencies of government
prove unwilling to fulfill responsi-
bilities they have assumed that these
responsibilities are likely to be with-

 

drawn,

Now let us consider the immediate
issues of student government at
Washington and Lee. Since 1958 sev-
eral regulations have been issued by
the faculty in matters that had been
subject to the authority of the Inter-
fraternity Council for a number of
years previously. I believe these
regulations have not been issued by
a trigger-happy faculty, as has been
suggested. Rather, they have been
issued by a reluctant faculty, for
whom the easier course would have
been to ignore undesirable condi-
tions and hope they would go away.
But these were the very conditions
that requires a responsible faculty
to act.

IFC Weakness Is Structure

If in the past the Interfraternity
Council has failed to deal adequately
with many of the problems before
it, I suggest it has not been primarily
the fault of the personnel who have
been its members. Its lack of strength
has been a consequence of its struc-

' ture. So long as individual fraterni-

 

ties insist upon ratifying all but the
most trivial actions taken by the
IFC, the IFC is critically handicap-
ped in attempting to do the job that
the students and faculty alike want
it to do. It can discharge no greater
responsibilities than the fraternities
give it authority.

I am willing to recount the events
that preceded recent faculty actions
to any student who wishes them re-
counted. However, I have little taste
for recounting the IFC’s past failures,
and for me to do so here would
scarcely contribute to construction
of future success.

Issues at Hand

Construction there is to be done.
Several issues that cannot be un-
tended indifinitely remain before the
students of the University. These
include: (1) Despite a strong direc-
tive from the Board of Trustees in
1956 and the IFC’s assumption, at
its own request, of responsibility for
enforcement of this directive, hazing
practices inimical to the purposes
of the University continue to be ex-

 

ercised by all but three of the eigh-
teen fraternities on campus; (2)
rushing procedures have been
changed little for many years during
which a number of defects have be-
come both more apparent and more
important.

Students Should Act

The faculty would have preferred
students to resolve the conflicts be-
tween fraternity parties and the Uni-
versity social functions. The faculty
would prefer now that students seize
control of the problems cited above
and other problems remaining before
the student body.

I believe in total that in matters
of student government the interest
of the students and faculty are not
so divergent as controversy over
passing issues makes them seem.
Students and faculty have a common
interest in large, responsible, and
vital self-government of students.
Your freedom is also our freedom.
Your development is the justification
of our lives.

McGowin Stars
Despite Defeat

The baseball team dropped its fifth
straight game Wednesday to Bridge-
water by a score of 6-1.

Despite the loss, Mason Mc-
Gowin looked sharp on the mound.
With the exception of the 8th when
Bridgewater pushed across four runs
after two were out, McGowin was
very effective. He struck out 11
while walking only two. The lone
run for the Generals came in the
fifth inning when Hobbs was safe on
an error, Williams singled, and
Hobbs came home on a sacrifice fly
by Jim Russ.

Lou Flanagan, starting his first
game for the Generals, led the team
in hitting with a double and a
single.

Bridgewater tallied one in the 2nd
and one in the 6th to make the score
2-1 going into the eightth. A series
of singles brought the Bridgewater
total to a winning sixth in the 8th.

The Generals have a heavy slate
during the next week with four
games scheduled. The next home
game is May 1 against Hampden-
Sydney.

 

Lacrosse Team In Good
Shape For North Carolina

The W&L stickmen, having had a
disappointing season so far this year
being winless in eight starts, feel
they are ready to break their jinx
this weekend. The Generals meet the
University of North Carolina on
Wilson Field at 2:30 p.m. with one
of the most complete teams they
have fielded yet.

Plagued with unfortunate injuries
for a good part of the season ,the
lacrosse team has been hampered by
being forced to use some of their
most potent players only sparingly.

Coach Bob McHenry commented
that he may move some of the more
outstanding “B” team boys up to the
varsity to increase the depth of the
team. With the team in good physical

*Chip Day took the discus. Strong-

man Mike Shank placed second in
the mile and two mile, while Skip
Essex won the 440 yd. run in 503
seconds. Henry Sackett won the hop,
step, and jump with 41’ 1 1/2” and
the broad jump with a 20’ 1” jump,
and Robin Kell won the high jump
at 3 8".

Coach Lord, extremely happy
with the team effort in the last
meets, will take the entire team to
the Davidson Relays this weekend.
The team with a 4-1 record will
go as top contender. Dr. Roberts,
the pole vault coach; Coach Mc-
Laughlin, the field coach; and Coach
Lord all feel the team is not at
full power with 52 men, lacking
depth only in the high and low
hurdles.

John Pearson, Skip Essex, Kit
Kell, and Captain Jim Hickey will
each be running 110 yards in the
440 yard relay at the Davidson re-
lays. This sprint team will be con-
centrating on breaking the existing
440 yd. Davidson Relay record.

Golfers Divide
Two Matches

By RICK CARRELL

The Washington and Lee
team moved the team’s season rec-
ord to 2-3 by splitting a two match
road trip to eastern Virginia.

The team dropped a 6-3 decision
to William and Mary on Monday.
Vardaman and Henry took points
in the individual matches and the
best ball of Grantham Couch and
Vardaman took the Generals’ third
point. Steve Henry copped medal-
ist honors with an 80.

Tuesday, the linksmen moved back
on a winning course with a strong
7-2 victory over Norfolk Division of
William and Mary. They picked up
points in five of six individual
matches and in 2 of 3 best ball
matches. Vardaman and Lee coasted
to identical 6 and 5 victories, Couch
won four and three, Hughes won 2
and 1, and Stewart took a 3 and 2
decision.

Vardaman and Couch took an
overwhelming 7 and 6 victory in the
best ball competition. Henry, Mon-
day’s medalist, was the only Gen-
eral to lose in individual play, being
downed by a scant 2 and 1 score.

The team has three more matches
scheduled and will begin play in the
State Tournament next monday.

Relay Team Plans Assault

On Davidson

By ANDY KILPATRICK

Washington and Lee’s crack relay team of Kit Kell, Skip
Essex, John Pearson and Jim Hickey will go to the Davidson
Relays this weekend, with an eye on the 440, the 880, and the
Sprint medley relay records. Should these four trackmen run
at their peak Saturday, any of the records for these relays

Meet Records

 

could be broken.

Jim Hickey holds the W&L record
in the 100 and 220 yd. dash, and Kit
Kell, a freshman, has offered a
strong challenge to Hickey all sea-
son. Skip Essex, an extremely versa-
tile runner, has marked up times of
50.1 and 50.3 seconds in the 440 yard
run in the last two meets.

John Pearson pulled a double up-
set in the high and low hurdles

against Norfolk last Saturday and
ran an outstanding time in win-
ning the 220 yard low hurdles in
the Lynchburg meet here Tuesday.

These sprinters will be running
against a record time of 43.7 seconds

 

Tennis Team

Defeats R-M

The Washington and Lee tennis
team traveled to Randolph-Macon
Wednesday and soundly defeated its
rather deceptive opponent 6-3, thus
evening the season’s record at 2-2.

Captain John Baker found quite a
surprise when he trounced his man
6-0 in the first set, only to be

ot turned back after a hard match in
‘| the next two sets, 6-1, 7-5. Playing
.|in the number four

position, Jim
Mell lost a tough one to his man
man after another three-set battle,
6-4, 3-6, 6-1.

Randy Jones found little difficul-
ty with the number two man win-
ning his match, 6-2, 6-2. Jim De-
Young and Bud Hollman also won
for the Generals, 6-1, 6-3 and 6-4,
6-1, respectively. Freshman Lindsey
Short made the match 3-2 with his
win in the number six spot, 7-5, 6-1.

It was the doubles’ matches that
made the difference. Captain Baker
and Randy Jones lost their number
one doubles, 6-1, 6-2. But the strong
teams of DeYoung and Short along
with Mell and Hollman powered
their way through their opponents,
winning the second doubles, 6-3, 6-4
and the third, 6-2, 6-3.

The team continues its trip on
down to William and Mary for a
match Thursday, and then returns
to play Richmond here this Satur-
day.

the issues of the elections were, and

The day of voting came finally,
and rumors ran rampant. About 6
p.m., someone ran in the Commons
and screamed, “University Party

Now the election is over, the at-

the candidates supported were real
and important—and everybody won-

with the discarded posters and tem-
porary comradeships with undecided
voters.

The Great Debate

The color and glamor of a “real”
election was achieved several times
during the week. The informal de-
bates between the big three can-
didates, held Monday night in the
Student Union, brought out vital
issues and how each of the candi-
dates stood, and gave these issues
an importance that hadn’t been fully
realized before. The Quad of the

occasions, was spangled with serious-

This was a strong blow to the In-

to gain considerable backing from
the freshman dormitories.

Protest Backs Up

When the student independent
newspaper Protest, perhaps the big-
gest single factor in the 1961 upsets,
came out for Ireland, Boardman and
Butler on Thursday morning, the
Independent Party chances took an
even bigger dive than expected.

By five in the afternoon, when the
polls closed, there seemed little
question about who would win the
Big Three positions. University
chairman Grantham Couch was only
worried about Fancy Dress, and that
was unnecessary.

The EC finished counting the votes
by six o'clock, and the University
Party had its first sweep since the
1959 elections.

‘Prince Valiant’ Creator
Shows Cartooning Secrets

By HARRY MEEM
SIPA Edition Managing Editor

Research and people are the sec-
rets behind “Prince Valiant.”

Hal Foster, who draws the na-
tionally syndicated comic strip for
King Features, made these points
yesterday in an address to SIPA del-
egates at Washington and Lee.

When he first started the strip, “I
had a beautiful story line all ready.
I got Val and his parents on a boat—
and there they stood, naked, for the
next three months. I had no idea
what sort of clothes they wore, what
kind of armor, what kind of boat
even. So I had to look it all up.”

Foster has spent a good deal of
time since he started the strip
traveling to the countries which he
uses as settings for Valiant’s adven-
tures. He finds this necessary for
the sake of accuracy; to check the
terrain, what the buildings look like,
the shapes of the trees, and back-
ground in general.

The accuracy is a necessity, for
every little mistake which he makes
brings letters from “experts” in the
field concerned.

 

_The travels serve another purpose,

for the people he meets on the way
often reappear in the cartoon.
Another problem Foster faces in
drawing “Prince Valiant” is that of
local regulations prohibiting show-
ing certain things in pictures. He
once drew a picture of a nightmare
which his hero had, showing all
sorts of weird creatures from the
underworld, including a snake. Un-
fortunately, one state has a regula-
tion prohibiting drawing snakes. So
the syndicate had to make a substi-
tution—four snake eggs.

There are also social taboos he
must observe in drawing his hero.
For instance, he can show Valiant
standing in the middle of a fight,
with his famous “Singing Sword”
dripping crimson, but he can’t show
the prince actually striking a man.
Likewise, Val can’t be shown actual-
ly taking a drink of wine, even
though he may be shown sitting
with a full cup in his hand.

Foster also gave a quick history
of cartoons, from paintings on cave
walls in southern France through
Chinese picture writing to the use of
comics to increase newspaper circu-
lation.

Wide Range Of

Radio Washington and Lee marks
its second full year of broadcasting
this year.

Broadcast Monday through Friday
nights from W&L’s Journalism De-
partment studios in conjunction
with radio station WREL, the five
different programs which fill a time
spot from 8:05 to 9:00 p.m. offer
a wide range of entertainment for
Washington and Lee and Rockbridge
County listeners.

Nick Denton, a junior from Chevy
Chase, Md., is Program Coordinator
for Radio Washington and Lee. Den-
ton also produces the Wednesday
night show, “Emphasis Abroad.”

Classical Music

Monday night is devoted to clas-
sical music and opera. “Pro Musica,”
produced by Pete Lynn, a senior
from Lynchburg, Va., has also of-
fered its listeners a program of
music by Robert Stewart, Assistant
Professor of Fine Arts at Wash-
ington and Lee, played by the Roa-
noke Symphony Orchestra.

Steve Guild, a junior from Okla-
homa City, Okla., produces the Tues-

day night show, “Concert.” Guild
plays semi-classical music, sounds
of a less serious nature than those
played on Monday night’s show.

The Wednesday night show, “Em-
phasis Abroad,” is a neweomer to
the Radio Washington and Lee sche-
dule this year. Denton and his as-
sistant producers, Phil Bacon and
Bill Gray offer music from other
countries, including Mexico, France,
and Russia. In addition, each pro-
gram includes some of the history
and literature of the country.

Thursday night’s show, “Kaleido-
scope,” is the ancestor of Radio
Washington and Lee. First intro-
duced in 1956 by SIPA Executive
Director John Jennings, then a
W&L student, the program is pres-
ently produced by Andy Adelson, a
junior from Baltimore, Md. Adelson
presents a wide range of shows, from
strictly documentary types to radio
plays and comic takeoffs,

Friday night’s program is con-
cerned with “The Sound of Jazz,”
produced by senior Thorns Craven.

Reston

The struggle to “adjust to the
problem of change” and President
Kennedy’s “new generation” world
leadership were discussed Friday in
a speech by James Reston to the
33rd annual SIPA convention.

Reston, the chief of the Wash-
ington Bureau of the New York
Times, spoke to some 1,100 delegates
attending the annual convention at
Washington and Lee University.

Controversy over the Truman-
Acheson era and the Eisenhower-
Dulles era have come and gone, Res-
ton said, but the problems remain
the same. Sweeping changes—in-
volving increased automation, in-
creasing population, and attendant
political problems—have created new
and complex headaches for
leaders.

Since World War II, one billion,
two hundred million people have
changed their form of government
and 800 million have achieved inde-
pendence for the first time, he said.
This has created another primary
difficulty for conduct of world af-
fairs.

“Old societies which provided such
order as there was before the war...

world |

 

have taken a secondary position.

The decisive power has passed
from Europe to the United States and
the Soviet Union—“The two least
experienced in conduct of foreign
affairs,” Reston said.

Mobility within the United States
is another factor adding to the com-
plexity of political decision-making,
acecording to Reston.

The United States has “a totally
fluid society the like of which we
have never seen in this country be-
fore.” He mentioned the movement
of people to the West, the shift of
Northern technicians to the

some

South, and the shift of Negroes from
the South to the North. Leaders,
therefore, have new situations to
adjust to constantly, according to
Reston.

The New York Times Bureau chief |
also cited the world population in- |
“perhaps the most dang- |

creases as
erous outbreak in world history.”
Automation and its effect on
overall scope of political affairs was
also mentioned as an adjustment
problem.

Winners of the other three state
scholastic awards were The Hickory
Twig, Hickory High School, Hickory,
N. C.; Hi Times, Honea Path High
School, Honea Path, S. C., and Mul-
lens Hi-Lights, Mullens High School,
Mullens, W. Va.

The Hickory Twig was given the
12th annual North Carolina Scholas-
tic Press Award “for its effective
role in school and community af-
fairs; for the completeness of its
coverage; for its high journalistic
standards; and for its lively spirit.”

The North Carolina Scholastic
Award was sponsored by the Wins-

‘Spectator’ Wins Virginia Prize

By ROBERT HOLLAND
SIPA Edition Editor
The Spectator of Granby High School, Norfolk, Va. today
was named winner of the 14th annual Scholastic Press Award
of the Virginia Press Association.
The citation, presented at the SIPA convention luncheon

in Doremus Gymnasium, praised The Spectator “for its varied
and complete coverage of all phases*

 

written and photographic coverage;
for its recognition of school and re-
lated problems; for its innovations
and pleasing presentation.”

Hi-Times was given the David A.
Tillinghast Memorial Award of the
Greenville News-Piedmont Company
for the South Carolina Scholastic
Press—the third annual award given
in South Carolina. Hi-Times was
praised “for its well-balanced ob-
jectives in relation to students, facul-
ty, parents and community; for its
appropriate recognition of individual
and group achievements; for its con-
cise, factual reporting and effective
use of good pictures.”

Sixteen other publications and a
radio program have received SIPA
trophy awards.

These trophy winners were select-
ed as top publications from a field of
305 publications entered. Seven
newspapers, seven yearbooks, two
magazines, and a radio station won
the first place awards.

See page three for a complete list
of trophy winners.

 

James B. Reston, the chief of the
Washington Bureau of the New York
Times and speaker at a noon session
Friday of SIPA, wound up as the
“President of Inland Steel” on one
of the SIPA current events quiz-
zes given Friday after Reston’s
speech.

Byron White, the newest member
of the United States Supreme Court,
also was described as a Briton “who
is a member of the Ban the Bomb”
on one of the quizzes.

The current events quiz, given an-
nually at SIPA conventions was won
this year by Hugh Moore of Mc-
Callie School, Chattanooga, Tenn.
Moore received a score of 88—one
of the highest in the history of the
quiz.

Newspaperman Reston and Su-
preme Court Associate Justice White
were not the only “displaced per-
sons” found in the stack of quizzes.
The quiz produced its usual amount
of unusual answers.

 

 

 

 

‘Displaced Persons’ Show Up
On SIPA Current Events Quiz

Great Polo Player

For instance, Bernis Owens, the
PFC whose criticism of President
Kennedy’s call-up of the reservists
almost earned him a court martial,
was variously described as “a great
polo player who just fell off his horse
to a “U.S. playwright who has
a play off Broadway.”

Joseph Francis Rummel, the New
Orleans Archbishop who recently
excommunicated three segregation-
ists, was described on the quiz as
a “Catholic Archbishop who survived
persecution during World War II.”

Rummel was also called a German
pianist who is becoming very popu-
lar in the United States.

The director of the Housing Ad-
ministration, Robert Weaver, was
labeled the “head of the John Birch
Society; a radical organization,” and
“a Senator who attacked a civil
rights bill.”

chev—were born in the nineteenth
century in contrast to Kennedy.

After the Cuban fiasco, the Soviet
Union began to put pressure on the
|new United States Administration to
see how it would commit itself. For
example, this pressure has been ex-
erted in Berlin, on the nuclear test-
ing question, and on disarmament, he
said.

This pressure “has settled down
the Administration in a way, per-
haps, that success would not have
settled it down.”

The many factors involved in
| world problems creates a problem
jfor reporters as well as_ political
| leaders, he said.

 

Too often, he said, reporters report
lonly single incidents and not the
’ ‘broad picture.” Reporters are like-
| ly to be reporting “the unusual and
| the violent and emphasizing the
| unusual and the violent.”

“T think this | is a false picture of
| where we are,” Reston said. “If we
take a broad view, we need not be

| too pessimistic.”
| Both extraordinary accomplish- |
|ment and disappointment can be
| found, he said, but if one compares

ship after World War II with the
record of British and French leader-
ship after World War I, the picture
is rosier.

In a question and period following
his speech, Reston said that Kennedy
was the “first President in modern
times who is using all the instru-
ments at his command and cen-
tralizing them.” He is surrounded
by advisers and cabinet members
who have technical knowledge, but
who are not dominant personalities.

Reston predicted that as the trend
toward an urban society continues,
the trend toward centralization of
government will continue.

In response to another question,
he said of the Peace Corps—‘“as a
symbol I think it’s a very good
thing,” adding that it demonstrates
to the world’s people that the “mis-
sionary zeal of United States” citi-
zens has not completely vanished.

Referring to the recent steel price
controversy, Reston said that he
thought the President would exert

| his influence to hold down wage de-

|

mands of labor unions, but he added
that he does not have the legal power
against labor that he had against

| the record of United States leader-! business.

Truth And Freedom

“He serves best who serves the truth.”

The above is the motto of an organization dedicated to
combatting secrecy wherever it exists and promoting freedom
of the press throughout the world. The organization is Sigma
Delta Chi, a professional journalistic society which was founded
in 1909. The Washington and Lee Chapter of Sigma Delta
Chi plays an important role in SIPA conventions.

Sigma Delta Chi is the oldest, largest, and most select or-
ganization in the field of journalism. It is the only organization
that embraces all kinds of journalism as well as all ranks of
journalists. It is dedicated to the highest ideals of professional
journalism and is comparable to professional organizations
serving the fields of medicine and law.

The purposes of Sigma Delta Chi may briefly be defined
as: (1.) promotion of the highest standards of newspaper prin-
ciples and ethics, and (2.) promotion of our most valuable
freedom, freedom of the press. SDX chapters work toward the
first objective throughout the country by annually giving
Distinguished Service Awards in Journalism in fifteen cate-
gories of journalism. These awards are offered in the hope that
they will stimulate outstanding journalistic accomplishment.

In our opinion SDX’s work toward the second objective—

 

that of freedom of the press and freedom of information—is ,

even more important than the first. Since 1946, Sigma Delta
Chi has maintained a standing national committee which takes
an active, aggressive leadership in the cause of freedom. Sigma
Delta Chi statutes, providing for open meetings by public
agencies and for open access to public records, have been put
into effect in many states. Other extensive work has been, and
is being accomplished by this group.

We believe that Sigma Delta Chi’s work should be supple-
mented by the efforts of all citizens, whether they are associated
with the press or not. If truth is to triumph over falsehood, the
objectives of Sigma Delta Chi must be maintained.

SIPA—1962

The press and its historic role in shaping the destiny of this
country is a fascinating and valuable study for anyone to under-
take—whether he be a journalist, prospective journalist, or
interested citizen. The saga of the press and its continuing
fight for the public’s “right to know” indeed closely parallels
the growth of the United States as a great nation among the
world powers. Freedom of the press and our other many
cherished freedoms are, in fact, inseparable.

It is for this reason that greeting so many high school
students vitally interested in the press is such a gratifying ex-
perience. The Southern Interscholastic Press Association, and
similar press meetings, provide a unique opportunity for inter-
ested students to enrich their understanding of journalistic
processes.

The more than 1,100 secondary school students attending |

the 33rd annual SIPA have, in our opinion, been attending
a highly worthwhile gathering. Throughout the years the SIPA
convention has contributed immensely to standards of year-
books, magazines, and newspapers of secondary schools in the
South. SIPA has been growing, both in numbers and influence,
since it was begun at W&L 33 years ago.

Students and advisers who through the years have traveled
to Lexington have made the largest single contribution to the
manifest success of SIPA. The convention’s value is a personal
matter—what a student takes away from the two-day affair
depends on how fully he takes advantage of the opportunities
before him. Judging from the delegates’ attendance and re-
sponse this year to the lectures, panel discussions, class sessions
and short courses, clinics, and informal get-togethers it would
seem that opportunity has not been wasted.

In every sense, this seems to have been a productive session.
James “Scottie” Reston of the New York Times and Hal

Foster provided valuable insights into their respective speciali- |

ties. Other professionals were also quite informative and enter-
taining. The Washington and Lee University Department of
Journalism and Communications, the W&L chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi, professional journalistic society, the members of
the W&L Laboratory press, and the Administration of Wash-
ington and Lee—all have played important roles in making
SIPA a success again this year.

Ultimately, however, the people who attend SIPA as del-
egates determine its success or failure. And we thank you sin-
cerely for making the 1962 convention a big success. As you
return to your respective homes and schools, we hope you will
not forget the hours spent here. We hope some spark of in-
spiration has been kindled and will remain kindled within you
and that you will want to seek more information about journal-
ism.

Journalism is a broad term that encompasses a wide range
of activity—from newspapers to magazines to radio and tele-
vision. Making an all-inclusive list of everything that falls under
the term of journalism would be an onerous task. But one
salient generalization can be safely made about the field; it is
a vitally important one and one that is becoming more import-
ant each day. The complexity of the world we live in makes it
imperative that events be explained accurately and put in
the proper perspective. This is the large role journalists have to
fulfill.

The most fascinating thing about journalism is that no one
can ever learn everything about it. But there are precious re-
wards to be garnered in striving for the unattainable.

Ww and L’s Home Edition Staff Provides
Most Complete Daily Coverage In County

The most complete daily news
| coverage in Rockbridge County was
| provided during the past year by the
largest radio news staff in the State
of Virginia—Washington and Lee’s

around to cover a_ late-breaking
story, tape recording Radio Moscow
for “the other side of the story,” or
taping the remarks of the many
prominent speakers who come to
W&L.

Home Edition.

Home Edition, a nightly 15 min-
ute newscast from the Washington
and Lee radio newsroom, is a unique
| combination of classroom laboratory
land extra-curricular activity. Inter-
national, national, sports, state and
local news are covered in the student
broadcasts.

Since Home Edition is on the air
| five nights a week, it is the primary
| source for local news for area citi-
| zens. Often it beats the two county
| weekly newspapers by several days
|in breaking a story.
| The W&L-produced newscast is
| the last news show of the evening
carried by radio station WREL.
| Local news is covered by mem-
| bers of Washington and Lee’s Jour-
| nalism Department, with each stu-
| dent covering a “beat” for two se-
|mesters while attending the univer-
sity. Other Home Edition news ar-
| rives via Associated Press teletype.
Regular beats covered by the stu-
| dent reporters in the county include
| the town and county offices, police
| stations, club and charity organiza-
| tions, VMI and W&L, and the sports
| activity in the area.
| All stories are rewritten by mem-

staffs in order to produce a program
of sound format and consistent style.

first semester.

| Senior editors, who direct each of

the five nightly shows, are Rod
| Cockshutt, Gene Hulbert, Howard
| Slater, Robert Holland, and Kelly.

In addition to its regular news-
gathering tasks, Home Edition also
broadcasts a weekly editorial each
Friday night, and special editorials
when the need arises. An editorial
board consisting of Kelly and the
five seniors meets each Wednesday
to plan editorial campaigns.

This year, the editors began a
new policy—one which has proved
to be quite successful, they believe.
After an editorial is presented on
WREL, a copy is sent to the two
local weekly newspapers. The editors
of these newspapers have printed
several Home Edition editorials of
local interest in the past few months.

Special coverage is required when

Home Edition has provided that cov-

were made when Senator Albert

John Jennings
Again Directs
SIPA Activity

The massive task of handling the
organization of SIPA was conducted
by John K. Jennings, W&L instruct-
or in journalism and Executive Di-
rector of SIPA.

Once again this year, Jennings
held this important post—a position
which is a real year-round opera-
tion since the planning for an SIPA
convention must start as soon as the
previous year’s activity is finished.

As Jennings can testify, the job
is often a tedious one. He made the
first contacts with this year’s dele-
gates last November when 2,500

 

JOHN JENNINGS

postcards were mailed to secondary
schools. The big mailing, however,
came in January when registration
forms, bulletins, and announcements
for the State Scholastic Press As-
sociation Awards were sent out.

Meanwhile, the Advisory Commit-
tee was corresponding and exchang-
ing ideas. Several secretaries handled
the voluminous mail which flowed
into the journalism department.

When the entry forms and pub-
lications arrived, they were classi-
fied and judged, and certificates were
prepared for the winners.

As time for the 33rd annual con-
vention rolled around, Jennings was
a familiar figure slouched over his
desk, working to “beat the dead-
line.”

This marked the third year Jen-
nings has served as the Executive
Director. He also helped with the
convention when he was a student
at Washington and Lee.

What benefit can SIPA delegates
derive from their experience at the
convention?

“The delegates can profit the most
from a free exchange of advice
among themselves,’ Jennings said.
“This convention is a good place to
work out problems, because most
problems that arise in school pub-
lications aren’t unique to any one
school.”

SDX Amendment Opens

Executive Council Sessions

The Sigma Delta Chi chapter of
Washington and Lee has successfully
sponsored an amendment to the

W&L student body constitution re-|

quiring that Executive Committee
meetings be open to the press and
public.

The proposal won overwhelming
support in the student elections held
the day before SIPA delegates began
to arrive for their convention.

Co-sponsoring the amendment
was the Tuesday Edition of the
Ring-tum Phi.

Working toward greater freedom

of the press is one of the expressed |

aims of national Sigma Delta Chi

 

and the W&L chapter.

‘es for the journalism

|for printing the Ring-tum Phi but)
i most of W&L’s other campus publi-
cations, posters, and pamphlets.

The first person concerned with

copy, as we follow an issue of the
| W&L newspaper through the print)
| shop, is the Linotype operator, Lyn-

wood Pullen. Often Pullen must
| double in his duties and act as
proof reader and copy editor.

Next, the type goes to Edward
| Backus, the print shop’s chief com-
| positor. Backus formerly ran _his
|own print shop in Buena Vista and
' annually teaches a newspaper short
course to SIPA delegates.

Edwin Walker is probably the most
versatile man in the shop. In addi-
tion to assisting Backus, he operates
the shop’s two smaller presses, casts
plates for pictures and newspaper
advertisements, and operates the
machine which folds newspapers as
they come off the press.

The completed forms, ready for
for printing, go to pressman Don
| Tabbut, who came to Lexington from
the Virginia Gazette in Williamsburg.

Mr. Lauck’s work is not confined
to his print shop. He conducts class-
foundation,

national Graphic Arts Education As-
sociation and several years ago he

| was awarded a Distinguished Serv-

vice Citation at the annual SIPA
awards banquet “in recognition of
outstanding accomplishments in the
field of scholastic publishing and in
acknowledgement of devotion and
effective service to journalism, to
education, and to youth.”

Two years ago, Lauck received the
honor of being elected a fellow of
the Royal Society of Arts and Crafts
in London.

‘Ringer’ Candidate Ousted

One candidate for SIPA President
never really got his campaign off
the ground.

Lanny Butler, Washington and Lee
junior, and recently elected student
body secretary, was being pushed by
some of his political bedfellows for
the high school post. However, this
“ringer” was exposed yesterday at
the opening ceremonies by Prof.
O. W. Riegel, SIPA Director

Better luck next year, Lanny.

IFC PRESENTED NEW RUSH PROPOSAL

Edward

To Aid In

Of New Troub Plays

By JACK DEJARNETTE

Playwright Edward Albee will arrive tomorrow to help with
the Troubadour Theater production of two of his plays, The
American Dream and Zoo Story.

Albee, who is 33, has been

writing for the theater. He has taught at Wagner College in
New York City, and has done work*

with the Circle in the Square, an off-
Broadway theatrical group.

To date, Albee has been primari-
ly associated with the off-Broad-
way production of The American
Dream and Zoo Story. He is the
author of two other plays which
have been produced off-Broadway,
The Death of Bessie Smith and The
Sandbox.

Premiered in Berlin

Zoo Story, the play for which
Albee first achieved recognition, was
first produced in Berlin in the Schil-
ler Theater. The Death of Bessie
Smith premiered there also. Albee
has won both Vernon Rice and Obie
awards in recognition of his works.

Albee is considered to be one of
a new group of playwrights asso-
ciated with the theatre-of-the-
absurd movement initiated in
France by Beckett and Ianesco.
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,
Albee’s first full-length play, is to
be released sometime this fall. Albee
is also working on a second full-
length play, Ballad of the Sad Cafe.
This is to be an adaptation of the
short story of the same name by
Carson McCullers.

To Speak May 7

Albee will be in Lexington for 10
days. His only public appearance
during that time will be on Monday,
May 7. He will speak on “The Po-
sition of the Playwright Today” at
8:15 in the Troubadour Theater.
Students and faculty will have an
opportunity to meet the playwright
during a 4 p.m. reception in Evans
Dining Hall.

In the capacity of Glasgow visit-
ing Professor, Albee will attend re-
hearsals of The American Dream and
Zoo Story in an advisory capacity.
The Glasgow Visiting Professor pro-
gram was established here in 1957
and has included such prominent
persons as Katherine Anne Porter,

Executive Committees.

In other action the EC approved,
subject to the final vote of the stu-
dent body, three measures which if
adopted will substantially alter stu-
dent government procedures.

First they formally approved a
new student body constitution which
the EC had recently drawn up. Next
they passed a proposed amendment
which calls for the replacement of
the Publication Board’s representa-
tive to the EC by a second Junior
Class representative. And finally
they approved a measure, presented
on petition of 50 signatures, which
would see the inclusion of Honor
System procedure in the new con-
stitution.

All three of these proposals will
be voted on by the student body
in the class elections to be held
Monday.

It was also announced last night
that a forum of all EC candidates
running in the class elections will
be held Thursday at 7 p.m. in the
Student Union.

Before adjourning the committee

Rush Would Begin 6 Weeks
After Start Of School

By JULIAN MARKHAM
News Editor

In last night’s IFC meeting, the Rush Week Study Com-
mittee presented its recommendation for a delayed rushing sys-
tem at Washington and Lee. Terminating a six week study
period, the IFC Rush Committee headed by George Honts

 

recommended the proposed rush de-*
lay of one month as a change from
the present system that will
strengthen both the fraternity sys-
tem and the University as a whole.
On the first week-end after classes
begin in September, Freshmen in-
terested in pledging will visit each
of the fraternity houses on campus
during the following periods; Sat-
urday between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m;
and Sunday between 2 p.m. and 4
p.m. and 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. These
invitations will be carried in the
form of Open Houses and no formal
rush procedure will be allowed.

Formal Rush will begin the Sat-
urday in October when S&U re-
ports are issued, unless there is a
conflict with the University calen-
dar in which case Rush will be
delayed until | the next most suit-

Judge Barksdale
To Sit At Trial

A case of grand larceny is the
subject of the spring mock trial to
be held in the Law School on Thurs-
day of this week. The Honorable
Alfred D. Barksdale, District Judge
for the U.S. District Court of West-
ern Virginia will preside at the trial.

The grand larcency case involves
one Braxton Dew, who is charged
with the unlawful taking of an
electric typewriter from a freshman
student's room. The defense is a lack
of proper intent because the defen-
dant was intoxicated at the time of
the crime.

Committee chairman for the trial
is Francis Duckworth and committee
members are Robert Coyle and John
Dinkel. Co-counsel for the defense
are Garnet L. Patterson and Henry
Carter. Co-counsel for the prosecu-
tion are James Randolph and Jerald
Kestine.

The trial will begin at 2:00 and

able weekend as shall be deter-
mined by the IFC. There will be
no classes on the following Mon-
day and Tuesday. Fraternity men
will enter the dormitories on Fri-
day evening to make rush dates.

There will be four days of formal
rush beginning on Saturday and
ending on Tuesday with hours sim-
ilar to the present system.

Bids and selections will be submit-
ted on Thursday and formal pledg-
ing will begin on the following Sat-
urday.

The Committee recommends that
the following stipulations be ac-
cepted by the IFC and made a part
of the Rules of Rush and/or
pledging:

A) Hell Week and Help Week in
any form be immediately abolished.

B) Freshmen with three or more
U’s will be barred from rushing
until they have attained a_ .500
grade-point ratio on mid-semes-
ter or semester reports.

C) Deferred rush begin the day
mid-semester grades are submitted
by the faculty.

D) The Committee recommends
that the University begin classes
the first semester two days earlier
to compensate for lost time during
rush,

E) There will be no contact be-
tween freshmen and fraternity men
prior to formal rush except for the
periods during which the fraternities
are holding open houses on the first
week-end after classes begin.

F) Any social event sponsored by
the fraternities will be open to the
entire campus, prior to the period
of formal rush.

G) No upperclassman, excepting
dormitory counselors and non-fra-
ternity men will be allowed in the
freshman dormitories, lodgings or
the Commons unless he has the ap-
proval of the IFC president.

H) Any violation of these stipu-
lations or other stipulations set
forth in the Rush Pamphlets will
be adjudged as violations of the
rules and principles and spirit of
fair and clean rush and appro-
priate fines and punishments will
be meted out by the IFC Judicial
Council.

I) Freshmen not attaining or main-
.000 grade-point ratio on
mid-semester or semester reports
during the period of pledging be
suspended from pledging until such
an average has been attained on
mid-semester or semester reports,

Both IFC President Doenges and
Rush Committee Chairman Honts
stressed that the proposal re-
sponded to the two main Faculty ob-
jections to the present system: the
present early emphasis on the “so-
cial” rather than the “academic”
side of University life, and the pres-
ent trend of identifying a freshman
by his fraternity rather than by
his membership in the student body
of Washington and Lee. Doenges
termed the new proposal as an “ex-
tremely strong system that will help
the University to meet any of its am-
bitions while, at the same time, not
damaging the fraternity system in
any way.”

The proposed date for instituting
this delayed rush system, if adopted,
is the opening of the 1963-64 aca-
demic session. As such, the delayed
rush system as outlined above is in
skeleton form only. If the plan is
accepted, concrete rules and regu-
lations will be worked out by the
IFC in the next year. Honts ex-
pressed the Committee’s desire that
the IFC incorporate as many of the

 

Tuesday editions.

Rush Week Plan Is Sound

The Special Rush Committee of the IFC has developed
a sound plan concerning the problems of rush at W&L. The
system that they have proposed will eliminate the basic causes
of criticism of our present system and still retain the present
system’s better aspects.

Much time, effort and thought went into the drafting of the
proposal. It contains changes that can be made without causing
any great burdens on the part of any of the fraternities.

 

The complaint of having Freshmen meet the fraternities
before they meet the University will be eliminated by the
proposed new system. In addition the now controversial Hell
Week will be eliminated entirely. To some, any change, no
matter how good, will meet with disapproval. However, we
must realize that there are changes that are necessary in our
present system, and they must be made.

As we have seen in the past, we must act ourselves. If we
fail to take the initiative, someone will do it for us. This could
result in a system that would be unpopular to all. The Commit-
tee has devised a workable system and it deserves our support.

The proposed plan will not go into effect until the fall of
1963. This will give ample opportunity to work out many of
the details that will be necessary to make the system effective.
However, there are no obstacles in the new plan that cannot be
worked out and overcome.

This plan has many merits and deserves the support of all
fraternity men. The fraternities will still have ample time to
rush and to secure pledges, and the University will have a better
chance to assimilate the Freshmen into the ways of the school.

Constitution Should Be Passed

The passage of the Sigma Delta Chi amendment to allow
press representation at Executive Committee meetings will now
allow full coverage of all legislative sessions. It is significant to
note that it was the only amendment to receive the necessary
majority in the campus elections last Thursday.

We of the Tuesday Edition shall endeavor to keep the stu-
dent body informed of all legislative business conducted by the
Executive Committee. It is our hope that by being better in-
formed the campus will become more interested in the workings
of its government.

On the other hand, we are sorry to see that the Constitution
proposed by the Executive Committee failed to receive the
necessary one-half vote.

It is hard to understand the reasons behind its failure to
pass. The EC Constitution represented many hours of hard,
serious labor on the part of the Executive Committee. There
was nothing radically new or different in the proposed constitu-
tion. Rather, it sought to streamline the constitution now in use.

The EC Constitution was created with the best interests of
the Student Body in mind, yet, it failed to pass.

The Executive Committee gave ample publicity to their
document and sought to explain the necessary changes to the
Student Body. However, all of this met with little interest or
enthusiasm. Therefore, it seems rather ridiculous to kill a
worthwhile document that everyone seemingly approved.

We realize that there was another Constitution presented
by a group of students for approval. However, this document
was cumbersome and contained many unneeded provisions and
deserved to be defeated.

The EC-proposed Constitution will be presented again in
the class elections. At this time, the student body will again
have the opportunity to pass judgment. It is our hope that it
will succeed. There is no sound reason for it to fail. We hope
that the Student Body will wake up and give this document a
fair chance.

Unless the EC Constitution receives the necessary one-
half vote for approval, we will be forced to labor under our
old constitution until some one can dream up a document that
will meet everyone’s approval. At the present rate of progress,
it is hard to tell when this will be possible.

“Announcing workcamp,”
sign read.
To most that opening phrase on
a poster would not be particularly
alluring. But to a few who read on,
the rest of the poster was quite in-
triguing, for it told of the chance
for work and study for college stu-
dents in Ghana this summer.

Christian To Go

One of those to whom the notion
appealed was Meade Christian,
Washington and Lee junior from
Richmond.

“When Reverend Bill Snyder,
Episcopal minister to students
here, first approached me with the
idea,” Christian said, “I was
very uncertain about the whole
thing. It’s not easy to leave friends
and a comfortable summer job,
but the more I thought about it,
the more I saw that here was a
chance to spend my summer doing
something that will be worth re-
membering.”

And remember it he should, for
the group of 15 American and 15
Ghanian students will be roughing
it all the way. “I’ve already been
warned that food and living con-
ditions won’t be in the luxury class,”
he said. To start things in the right
way, he’s already begun a series of
a dozen shots he must take before
leaving.

The group, sponsored by the Na-
tional Council of the Episcopal
Church, will leave New York on
July 3 and will arrive in Accra, the

 

capital of Ghana, the next day. They

will have a brief indoctrination per-
iod and will then leave for the
workcamp in the Volta region on
the borders of the Republic of Togo
They won't return until August 28.

“T haven’t been told yet what type
of construction work we will be
doing, but 1 imagine it will be some-
thing vital, such as a hospital or
school,” Christian said.

This in itself would make the ven-

First, I will get a lot out of it per-

er than this, I hope it is a move

groups will come to know each
other better. It’s a way to possibly

help clear up misconceptions which
we have of the Ghanians and that
they have of us. I hope it’s a posi-
tive step forward in world com-
munications,” he said.

For this purpose Christian will be
spending the 25 days before he
leaves in the library “boning up on
both Ghana and America. I fully
expect that the most vital part of
the program will be the formal and
informal discussions we hav2 with
these people. They will be seeking
to understand America, and we will
be seeking to understand Ghana. J
hope to be able to use this under-
standing even more when we re-
turn,”

Christian admits he still feels
shaky about the whole idea—not be-
cause of the hardships but for the
significance the trip may have. “The
world and political situation being
what it is today, this trip could
very well be crucial to the entire
program.

“We will be called on to defend
our country, and any mistakes we
may make could be readily capital-
ized by anti-Americans. There are
possibilities for both great harm and
good here,” he said.

This mission, he feels is the right
thing for both his own future and
the future of world understanding.
“One thing has made me so cer-
tain of this is the great response
I have had from people here and
at home. Each student must
finance his own trip, and people
I hardly know have offered to aid
me out of their own pockets. I
think it’s something they would
like to do if they had the chance.
This really makes me optimistic.”

 

Dear Sir,

I am an Independent Party mem-
ber who is very discouraged by last
Thursday’s elections. But what both-
ers me is not the outcome of the
election but the way in which vic-
tory was seemingly achieved. No one
can deny that the winners of the
Big Three are competent and quali-
fied men and I am sure they will
carry W&L forward. I repeat, these
individuals are not the real ques-
tion.

What is discouraging is the way
we go about selecting our candidates
and our real reasons behind our
votes. Do we vote for the man or for
the party? I suspect we vote for the
party.

Spoils System

Now this doesn’t really upset me
because we work on the spoils sys-
tem and the party that wins has
more spoils to hand out so why not
vote straight party and receive our
fair share?

I'll tell you why. Because each
of us will someday be a respon-
sible member of society and it
will be up to us—the educated, the
leaders— to respond to society’s
needs and have a responsible and
responsive government. In order
to do this we are going to have
to support men and ideas—not
Democrats , Independents, or Re-
publicans, not big business and not
labor. Will we be prepared to take

a free and democratic society? I
think not, in the light of the past
elections.

Next year we will again have the
dance sets to give to houses that
are “in line.” We will probably even
have freshmen offices which will be
another three or four political spoils.

No Partisan Politics

But let’s get away from partisan
politics. Let’s examine the various
proposals. I can see how people could
justify their vote against changing
the E.C. Publications Board member.
I can see how people could vote
against the student-senate proposai.
But for the life of me I cannot see
why the E.C.’s constitutional propc-
sal failed. I can’t blame this on party
lines. Steve Suttle, Meade Christian,
and Buck Ogilvie worked together
many, many weekends in order to
polish it up for us. Both parties sup-
ported it. And yet it failed to ob-
tain the necessary two-thirds vote.
This is why I attack the party sys-
tem—this shows that it is not for
ideas that people vote but for the
party; and a proposal that does not
directly concern the party—even
though both parties strongly sup-
port it—is doomed to failure.

Why?
Why? Apathy. An easy word—
blame it on apathy and forget it. But

no, surely no one is that interested
in having a nominating convention

They swept over the town like

an office (or are they?), surely no
one is against the presidents of the
respective classes doing something—
like being president of a dance set,
surely no one is against the many
little changes which took so much
time and which are designed to serve
all of us better. And yet, with every-
one (except you know who) support-
ing the E.C.-proposed constitution, it
failed.

Do two men who put out a sheet
in “Protest” have that much in-
fluence? Or is it that we realiy
just didn’t bother to spend 15
minutes of our precious time io
read something designed for our
own good. This is the disappoint-
ment that I feel—not that the elec-
tions didn’t go the way I wanted
but that it exhibited so many traits
that are repugnant to me.

 

W&L Students Are Unthinking Voters

Thursday Voting

If each of us, when he voted
Thursday, was sincere that our votes
were cast for the best men and not
for the party, if each of us who ab-
stained or voted negative on the pro-
posed constitution had an honest
reason for doing so then I apologize
and will support wholeheartedly the
majorities’ position. But if we voted
a certain way because we were told
to do so or for selfish reasons, if we
abstained from voting because we
really just didn’t care enough to
read over something that represented
many personal sacrifices for others
then I think it is time for us to re-
evaluate ourselves and our func-
tions; for we are neglecting our re-
sponsibilities to ourselves and to

Washington and Lee.

After a jam packed, fun filled
week such as last one, this week
will probably be short-lived in the
memory of all of us. The anti-
climatic never seems to endure.
And so I have chosen not to write
about events like the election cer-
tainly was, and SIPA is being talk-
ed about like it certainly was, and
like all that.

Instead I prefer to dwell on some-
thing which has the potential to af-
fect us all in the
future. I’m speak-
ing of course of
the possible shift
in de-emphasis in
university athlet-
@ ics which might
= occur much soon-

might think. This
possibility has
been given some
impetus through
small but import-
ant articles on the sports pages of
the last two issues of the Ring-tum
Phi (with the exclusion, of course,
of the special SIPA edition). By
this time you should all have guessed
that I’m referring to the beginning
of a trend away from University
sponsored athletic endeavors and
toward individual pursuits such as
drag racing and turkey shooting.
This should be looked upon as a
manifestation of a much larger
trend. However, today I shall look
at it in itself and try to evaluate
drag racing and turkey shooting
at W&L per se.

Drag racing, first of all, is not

While not wanting to cast a stigma

Craven Lauds Turkey Shooting;
Offers Advice To Dragsters

engaged in this activity, I do think
we should look at the situation
realistically. Drag racing is bour-
geois. Let me hasten to add, how-
ever, that it need not remain so.

With this in mind, I want to pose
some questions to all present and
future would-be dragsters—ques-
tions which will have to be answered
in the affirmative before the Univer-
sity and the Student Body can of-
ficially sanction participation in this
nouveau competitive endeavor.

1) Do participants dress as gentle-
men? I can think of nothing worse
than a sport in which the uniform
of the day is allowed to be greasy,
oily and sweaty. W&L men should
be in the vanguard of dragsters who
insist upon coats and ties worn by
all drivers.

2) Is this sport honorable above
all? It is unnecessary for me to
point out why this question must
be answered with a_ resounding
“YES!” for a W&L man would never
enter a race with dishonorable com-
petitors. Especially drag racing, for
although honesty wins out in the
long run, dishonesty can almost al-
ways take you in the quarter-mile.

3) Is there some sort of assimila-
tion program set up for beginners
or must tyros educate themselves?
The recent election platforms should
point out the necessity of this.

4) Can a speaking tradition be in-
itiated? Unlike the sport of sports
car racing, in which drivers of
sports cars always wave to drivers
of other similar sports cars, I cannot
think of instances where dragsters
acknowledge another dragster’s pres-
ence except by a blast of fire and
smoke from the exhaust pipes. This
will have to be eliminated before
University sanction can be gained.

New Record

Pearson, Kell, Hickey and Essex
composed the record breaking team
for the sprint medley. They man-
aged to cover the distance in 3:37,
more than two seconds faster than
the old time set by High Point in
1960.

Robin Kell bested his recent
school record of 42.5 feet with a
hop, step and jump of 43 feet 1 1/2
inches. Henry Sackett tied Kell’s
old record in the same event.

In the Javelin event, Ken Boiar-
sky threw the dart 175 feet, 11 3/4
inches. This is the best toss of the
year for the W&L javelin throwers.

Sackett and Kell, with a broad
jump of 21 feet 7 inches and a high
jump of 6 feet 3 inches respectively,
posted other bests for the team this
season.

Today, the Generals meet Elon and
East Carolina, here.

Trout Fishing
Best In May

One sport seems to get overlooked
by students at Washington and Lee.

That sport is fishing.

For those who don’t realize it,
W&L is centrally located to most
of the best fishing streams in west-
ern Virginia. The Maury River, only
a few minutes’ walk from the cam-
pus, is one of the better smallmouth
streams in the state.

The two main fish sought after in
the area are trout and bass. The
trout which the fisherman will usu-
ally find in the 1,500 miles of trout
water open to the public is the rain-
bow. This is the fish with which the
Virginia Fish and Game Commission
heavily stocks the streams every
year.

About 300,000 adult fish averaging
12 inches are released yearly. The
best fishing begins after the opening
crowds have subsided. The season
began this year about three weeks
ago, and the best spring trout fish-
ing should be the month of May.

 

Notice

Spring soccer practice will be held
next week. All players returning
from last year’s team and any others
interested in trying out for the team
should draw equipment and go out
to practice.

Junior midfielder, Charlie Gum-
mey led the Generals scoring with
three goals, two of which were re-

Carrol Klingelhoffer, a freshman
in the attack position, was also a
standout with one goal and three
assists. Bob Hankey, another frosh
attackman, and sephomore mid-
fielder John McDaniel, who is the
team’s leading scorer to-date, each
tallied two goals.

Wirt Vanderworker turned out
the only outstanding performance
for the Tar Heels scoring two of
their goals.

Coach McHenry stated _ that,
though the Generals kept possession
of the ball most of the game, he felt
that their performance had dropped
from the two previous games.

CLUB &
CAMPUS
FASHIONS

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, esquirt's Fashion Director

A few early heat waves have triggered the rush to find something
cool to get into, and your wisest buy is the seersucker suit. As with
buying all summer clothes, select it with the thought of also wear-
ing it to work. Seersucker weaves, made by alternating stripes of
creped and plain weave, are growing favorites on Campus. Today’s
seersuckers are new in two ways; blending polyester with cotton
has ended that former slept-in look ... and a handsome new range
of colors and patterns is making news beside the traditional pale
stripings. Here are some highlights, plus a few other warm-weather
wearables—all top choice among university men.

 
  

  

SUIT... now in bold, bright-color stripes, very
wide to pinstripes—also unusual plaids, checks }
.and new patterns. With the crisp, assertive col- }
ors and the new shape retention, they’re perfect
for dress-up as well as casual occasions. Added
bonus: the suit jacket doubles as a sport jacket
... ideal with a pair of dark, solid color slacks.

ye
L
THE SHIRTS THAT SHOULD always and. only be worn with

your seersucker suits: solid color oxford or batiste button-downs.
And let the shirt pick up a color in the jacket... YELLOW, for
example—great! Then choose a solid or neat print silk foulard
TIE, or a cotton paisley.

ONE STRAW MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE—to complete the

junior executive look, the finished elegance of the well-chosen HAT
IS A MUST. Most popular: soft, flexible RAFFIA STRAW in
OLIVE... NATURAL COLOR, rough-textured COCOANUT
PALM—jaunty telescope crown, not too narrow brim, banded with
batik or madras prints... or with the 3-pleat, colorful band called
a PUGGREE, borrowed from India—originally the light scarf
around the pith helmets that used to ‘go out in the noonday sun.’

YES, MISTER—CLEAN WHITE BUCKS are

far and away the most suitable shoes we’ve ever
seen with seersucker suits.

Montgomery Is New SSS Head

The Student Service Society is
an organization on campus whose
importance is greatly underestimated
by the majority of students. Want-
ing in glory and renown, the So-
ciety nevertheless plays a key role
in the life and success of the Uni-
versity.

Consistent teamwork has made the
organization effective, and this year
under the leadership of Steve Galef
it has continued to play its part
efficiently. Deans Farrar and Gilliam
can cite numerous cases in which
the SSS has been the deciding fac-
tor in a top-notch student’s decision
to come here. The Admissions Of-
fice receives numerous letters of
praise from impressed parents and
prospective students.

New Officers

Next year the SSS will be under
the recently elected president Dave
Montgomery, a rising senior from
Richmond. The new vice president
is Tony Schlesinger, rising senior;
the secretary-treasurer is Ken Lane
rising junior; and the editor of the
Student Handbook is rising junior
Jim Wallenstein.

The society serves as host to a
number of groups visiting W&L.
Among these are the Australian
lacrosse team, the alumni return-
ing to reunions, and parents on
Parents’ Weekend. The annual
SIPA conference is likewise facili-
tated by SSS work.

The society's work ranges from
conducting tours of the campus to
ushering and seating guests at Uni-
versity banquets.

New Rush Plan

existing rush rules as would be
feasible under the new system.
Rush Committee member Roy
Goodwin emphasized the RWSC’s
feeling that this proposal must re-
ceive the careful consideration of
fraternity men. “It is not change
for change’s sake,” said Goodwin.
“The new delayed rush system as
proposed is the most workable plan
that can adequately coordinate the
interests of both faculty and fra-
ternity. The acceptance of this pro-
posed rush system by the IFC could
only lead to the faculty’s recogni-
tion of the IFC as a responsible stu-
dent organization.”

The Committee feels that its pro-
posed system has advantages over
the other delayed systems studied,
and even over the present system.
The proposal also stated that “We
feel the freshmen under the pro-
posed system will receive a more
adequate assimilation into the Uni-
versity life, with the proper empha-
sis placed on academic pursuits, and
will obtain a better perspective of
the Washington and Lee fraternity
system.”

These are the big questions in-

course there are others, but they are
of minor importance, and can be
taken care of when these big ones
are satisfied. I for one, am looking
forward to the time when dragging
becomes a full-fledged University
sport. Think of the thrill of seeing
one of the University station wagons
peeling rubber on the footbridge in
a race against the clock.

As for turkey shooting, I think
that the above questions must be
applied to this sport also. Of course,
some modification will be necessary.
But I think you will all agree that
the more turkeys that are shot
around here, the better off we'll
all be.

Student Opinion Varies On [FC Rush Plan

By ROGER PAINE
Friday Managing Editor
Since the IFC proposal to move
fraternity rushing up four weeks in
the school year has been released,
student bull sessions have taken a
serious turn. The proposal has
been intelligently aired at almost
every fraternity meeting and in
discussions in the dorms and in
the respective houses. Needless to
say, Rush Week touches the stu-
dents at Washington and Lee even
more closely, if possible, than the
hours of combo parties.

The student body is split up in-
to three basic groups of opinion.
One of these groups feels that
the new proposal is the best thing
for W&L and for the fraternity
system as a whole, that it far sur-
passes the old system in many
points, and that it should be passed.

The second group feels that the
present rushing system has proved
itself, that it has many strong

FRIDAY
Edition

points, and that it would be ridic-
ulous to change. The third and
strongest group feels that the IFC
proposal should be passed, but only
because the faculty will ram some-
thing even worse down the stu-
dents’ throats if it isn’t.
The Faculty Standpoint

A good number of students firm-
ly believe that the present sys-
tem should be changed. The facul-
ty is in favor of a change because
they want to get their hands on
the incoming freshmen before the
fraternity men do. Many faculty
members feel that the average
freshman coming to W&L gets a
bad impression of what the school
is all about by drinking beer and
talking about parties for more than
a week before seeing any books or
the inside of a classroom.

Fraternity men would like to
see the system changed for a dif-
ferent reason. Dave Peters, presi-
dent of the Sigma Nu house, feels

that while it is good to assimilate
freshmen into the social life of the
school as quickly as possible, the
new system would make it easier
on the freshmen and on the fra-
ternities too. The freshmen would
have more time to get a good grasp
on the academic and social atmos-
phere at Washington and Lee, and
the fraternity men would have
more time to organize their rush
plans.

This brings up the matter of the
month-long period between the be-
ginning of school and the time
when the S and U reports come
out. This has been designated in
the IFC proposal as the time to
begin formal rushing. At present
all that has been stated by the
IFC is that any rushing during this
time would be informal. If a fra-
ternity were to have a combo party
during that time, freshmen would
be allowed to go to it, but any
moves would be left to the dis-
cretion of the freshman.

he Ring-tun Phi

Washington and Lee Semi-Weekly Newspaper

George Honts, who led the IFC
committee which presented the
new rushing proposal, made it clear
that the present plan is only a
skeleton of what is hoped for, and
that in the coming year the neces-
sary refinements on this four week
period would be made. It is the
feeling of most fraternity men that
contact with freshmen during this
time would have to be on a casual
level and no higher. Otherwise the
four weeks would be hard on fra-
ternity men and on freshmen to
an extent not even approached
under the present system.

Tim Ireland expressed the
strongest sentiments for the group
of students who are opposed to
any change in the present system.
He said: “I’m convinced that the
present rush system is best for
W&L, and I see no valid reason
to change it. The present system
has proven itself. Any maladjust-
ment of the freshmen under the
present system would only be in-

tensified by this new system due
to the four weeks of social pressure.
I do not believe that any so-called
maladjustment now is due to the
fraternities.

“If this proposal is passed it will
be because of the fear that the re-
cent faculty decision on combos has
engendered in us, making us afraid
something worse will be forced on
us by the faculty if we don’t act
ourselves. I certainly do not think
that the new proposal should be
passed on its own merit.”

Those students in the third
group—that is, those who feel that
the proposal should be passed for
the very reason that Tim stated:
faculty pressure—point to the ac-
tions that the faculty has taken
on combos. It is obvious that they
are going to do anything they
want to, and the student body can-
not stop them, so it would he
better to pass this than to wait
until the faculty takes action.

300 Alumni
Arrive For
°62 Reunion

Over 300 alumni and their
wives are at Washington and
Lee this wekend for reunions
of the classes of 1912, 1922,
1937, and 1952.

A flurry of activities is
scheduled for the former stu-
dents, who include both aca-
demic and law school gradu-
ates. Alumni secretary William
Washburn said this year marks
the first time the Tucker Law
Lectures have been combined
with reunion activities.

“The unusual number of events
has increased our alumni interests
this year,” Washburn said. “We ex-
pect a 20 per cent increase in at-
tendance to reunion foundations this
year.”

Registration for the four classes
officially opened at 2 p.m. this after-
noon. Campus tours were conducted
by members of the Student Service
Society through the afternoon. Late
in the day President and Mrs. Fred
C. Cole held a reception for re-
turning graduates at the president’s
home.

The traditional “State of the Uni-
versity” reports by President Cole
and the university’s deans will be
given at 10 a.m. tomorrow in Lee
Chapel.

President Cole will be the featured
speaker at a 1:15 p.m. Saturday
luncheon in Evans Dining Hall for
the alumni.

Tomorrow afternoon the alumni
will have an opportunity to tour the
science building currently under
construction, and the new dorm
which is near completion. Members
of the IBM data processing staff will
give special demonstrations on
W&L’'s new IBM 1620 computer dur-
ing the afternoon.

Saturday afternoon will also see
a meeting of the Washington and Lee
Law School Association, composed
of all law alumni. Law alumni from
classes other than the reunion class-
es have been invited to attend the
meeting.

Major E. C. Roxbury, Professor of
Military Science and Tactics at W&L
for three years, is leaving his post
to attend the Armed Forces Service
School in Norfolk. At the school he
will receive training to familiarize
him for possible positions with the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Major Roxbury’s three years have
seen a number of improvements in
the local ROTC department.

Among programs instituted by
Major Roxbury during his three-
year stay here, none is more impres-
sive than the ::esprit de corps” that
he has managed to inject into
previously lackadasical outfit.

A material example of this newly
felt pride is the distinctive Wash-
ington and Lee military crest which
was designed by the Major. De-

SIPA’s Baffled By Current Events Quiz

By STEVE SMITH

George Romney turned up as pres-
ident of the AFL, General Motors,
Chrysler, and Ford last week in
the SIPA current events quiz giv-
en high school students attending the
journalism conference here. (Rom-
ney is actually associated with
American Motors.)

Romney was only one of a host
of misplaced persons on the quiz. All
personalities on the list had been
prominent in some recent news
event,

Spessard Holland, senior Senator
from Florida, was thought by some-
one to be the King of the Nether-
lands.

Gen. Edwin Walker was described
as “the next man to be shot into
space.” Also in the space line was
Soviet astronaut Titov, who became
the head of the Yugoslavian govern-

|} ment, engaged in an argument with
| Khrushchev. One U.S. astronaut
| didn’t fare so well—he was named
| the boxer who killed Benny “Kid”
Paret.

Archbishop Joseph Francis Rum-
mel of New Orleans, involved in a
segregation battle, was deseribed as
a “Catholic Archbishop who surviv-
ed persecution during World War II.”
He was also called a German pian-
ist who is becoming popular in the
United States.

Katherine Anne Porter, writer who
has spent some time at W&L, was
given the post of physician to Pres-
ident Kennedy.

Newly-appointed Supreme Court
Justice Byron White was called
a Briton “who is a member of Ban
the Bomb.” Robert Weaver of the
| Housing Administration was labeled
“head of the John Birch Society; a

 

 

radical organization,” and “a Sena-
tor who attacked a civil right bill.”

James B, Reston, New York Times
columnist who attended the conven-
tion as a featured speaker, was re-
warded for his efforts by being de-
scribed as the “President of Inland
Steel.”

Bernis Owens, the PFC whose
criticism of Kennedy’s call-up of
the reservists almost earned him a
court martial, was described as “a
great polo player who just fell off
his horse” and a “U.S. playwright
who has a play off Broadway.”

The Wife of U-2 pilot Gary Pow-
ers was called the wife of a “US
spy” who recently was stricken with
food poisoning.

Perhaps the most-maligned per-
sonage on the quiz list was Miss
Loubelline, a character in the “Po-
go” comic strip who was called one
of the characters in “Smilling Jack.”

New Rush Proposals :

The proposals submitted to the Interfraternity Council

 

by their committee on rushing procedures show a good deal

of careful thought and seem to us to be sound on the whole.
We are, however, hesitant to accept the premise that un-

necessary emphasis on the social side of life in the freshman’s |
first few weeks results from the present early rush system. It

seems to us that any unhealthy emphasis on the fraternities
could best be reduced by such methods as a drastic reduction
in the amount of time required by pledge training activities in
the fall.

But the idea that a later rush will take the freshman’s mind
off social life and fraternities seems to us as a patently unsound
one. This might prove true if rush were delayed for a year,
as the faculty petition last month proposed. But any freshman
who is confronted with such an important decision for his col-
lege future, and perhaps afterwards, is bound to give it a lot of
thought and worry.

Futhermore, we feel that the informal nature of the rush
dates on the first weekend of school will take away one of the
greatest advantages of the present system. The fraternities per-
form a very important service to the University at present by
providing a means by which a man may, at the very beginning
of his Washington and Lee career, meet a large number of
upperclassmen. These acquaintances can be of great help to a
freshman, giving him a sense of belonging and assuring that
there will be men outside of his own class who will take an
interest in his personal and academic future.

We also feel that the committee missed a chance to prove
the commitment of the fraternities to the academic goals of
the University by requiring a higher level of academic per-
formance before rushing privileges are extended. Fraternity
membership is a privilege and not a right. This right should be
predicated on academic performance which assures that the
freshman is well on his way toward graduation. A .5 average
gives no such assurance, but means only that the student will
probably not flunk out his first semester.

Fraternities play an important role in the academic work of
the good students who are in the majority here, but their
influence on the weaker students is positively bad at times.
Stringent academic requirements for both pledging and ini-
tiation would go far toward removing the present feeling
among professors that the fraternities represent a force con-
trary to the academic goals of the University.

We think that the IFC committee has done a very good job
in preparing suggestions for a change in rush procedure. But
we do think it important that some way be found to preserve
our advantage in introducing the freshmen to a large number
of upperclassmen at the beginning of his four years, and that
the IFC indicates by tougher grade requirements for pledging
that the fraternities want to raise the level of their members’
academic work.

Major Roxbury

The announcement today that Major Roxbury will be
transferred to another post next year will arouse a good deal
of disappointment in the student body. Major Roxbury has
improved ROTC at W&L a great deal. He has also been an
informative and stimulating commentator on military matters
for the non-military members of the University.

We'll miss him at W&L, but the Army being what it is, we
can only wish him great success in his next post.

The EC’s Constitution

The Executive Committee, in a moment of generosity,
has decided to give the student body another chance to approve
their series of constitutional changes which failed to gain the
necessary majority vote in Thursday’s elections. As an added
attraction, they have also voted to give the student body an-
other chance to replace the Publications Board representative
with an additional representative from the junior class.

We have opposed the elimination of the Publications Board
representative because of the generally good representation
that they have given the school. Bob Payne’s election to the
post further bears out our thesis that the Publications Board
can be counted on to send a good man to the EC.

It still seems to us desirable to do away with the nominating
convention and have candidates for student body-wide elec-
tions nominated by petition. Campaigns will be more meaning-
ful if a minority who have substantial support are able to pre-
sent a candidate to make their views known even if the party
system makes his chances of winning rather slim.

The proposal to replace the dance set president, except for
Fancy Dress, with class sponsors is a more controversial one.
We believe that it will contribute to class unity and make class
officers more meaningful. But the present system does assure
competent leadership of dance sets and tends to spread the re-
sponsibility around some more. This is a question that students
will have to consider carefully in making up their minds.

The EC has worked hard on this constitution and it certainly
deserves careful consideration before voting. The new constitu-
tion does make a number of controversial changes in the way
things are done here. If students are not in favor of the whole
thing, they should vote ‘‘No”’ and wait until they have a chance
to vote on each change separately, a less convenient but more
responsive way in which to consider the matter.

By BILL ATWELL

Much has been said in the past few
weeks about assimilation at Wash-
ington and Lee. A great deal of the
talk stemmed from the election of
student body officers. The basis was
the apparent lack of assimilation for
freshmen. I would, however, like to
discuss what seems to me to be an
over-emphasis on assimilation.

What I would really like to know
is what kind of game are people
playing in the “school-spirited save
the University” campaign which
seems to be running rampant now.
Earlier in the week I heard one
boy say that he and his friends had
assimilated one student 26 times for
not speaking. The speaking tradition
is a valuable and good institution—
but isn’t 26 times a little ridiculous?

If these zealous students really
want to help the University, they
should assimilate the man once and
let the assimilation committee take
care of the matter. If they are try-
ing to be funny, I see no humor at
all,

Ireland Assimilated

Last weekend the President-elect
of the student body was assimilated
for not wearing a coat and tie. He
had entered one of Lexington’s finer
eating establishments, late in the
evening, after driving more than
200 miles from an ODK convention
at William and Mary in Williams-
burg.

 

Mad Dash To Assimilate:
Tradition Contaminated?

Does anyone believe that many
people in the student body are go-
ing to censure Ireland for this? If
they do they are deluding them-
selves.

A Tradition or a Contest To Win?

It’s getting so some people are
comparing notes to see who is win-
ning the contest for most assimila-
tions a day. What is all this suppose
to prove?

I understand the editor of Protest,
Bill Lowry, is the one who did the
assimilating in the Ireland case. I
can’t believe he thinks Ireland or
anyone else in the College Inn late
at night, sans coat and tie, are
hurting the reputation of the Uni-
versity.

The only other thing I can see he
might be trying to show is that the
system dosen’t work and should be
changed. The fact is that the system
has been and is working effectively.

Conventional dress has been a
prime factor in furthering the good
public image Washington and Lee
now enjoys. It is a tradition which
should be and will be maintained.
But, just how far can this tradition
go?

Unwritten Exceptions to the Rule

There were and are exceptions to
the conventional dress rule. Dance
set weekends seem to be generally
agreed upon as one exception. Up
until now, nothing much had been

New Strength For Fraternities?

 

By TRACY HARRINGTON
The new IFC rush proposal has
brought forth widespread

and students alike.

The word is that the faculty and
the administration are “pleased”
with the plan, and eager to stand
behind the fraternities should they
endorse it. Fraternity men seem to
approve of the over-all proposal,
while objecting to one or a few of
its stipulations.

Exactly how will the change in
rush effect the present fraternity sit-
uation?

First of all, it will probably help
the “good” houses and hurt the
“poor” houses. Fraternities that de-
pend largely on national reputation
to attract pledges will no longer be
able to do so, and houses which are
outstanding locally but insignificant
nationally will face Rush Week much
more favorably.

Grade Importance Will Grow

Not only will freshmen be able
to see houses in a better light, but
also the fraternities will be able to
judge the potential pledges on more
than first impressions and recom-
mendations. S&U reports will be out
before pledging begins, so that the
fraternities will know ahead of time
how the freshmen are going to per-
form academically. Needless to say,
the importance of an early start at
good grades will rise.

One of the main points of con-
troversy is the condition for the
abolition of Hell or Help Week.
There seems to be a trend in a few
fraternities to want to veto the entire
program on the grounds of this one
facet of the proposal. They want a
Hell Week. This is well and and
good—but the truth of the matter is,
Hell Weeks and hazing are on their
way out. As has been said, hell
week is “a barbaric and_ senseless
anachronism that should mave been
abolished long ago.”

Molding Pledges: A Dubious Value

The dubious value of molding
pledges, and the argument that “all
good houses have a tough Hell
Week” will no longer hold water if
NO house has it. The Hill is com-
pletely against hazing, and it will be
gone soon anyway. The question is,
whether or not we shall choose to
do away with it ourselves or have
it forced upon us.

To reject what is basically a sound
and constructive program because
a few people want to see freshmen
vomit would be tragic.

The program would strengthen the
fraternities, in that it would make
for less Rush Week “mistakes” on
both sides. It would favor the fresh-
men in that they would have an op-
portunity to know more fraternities
intimately, they would be able to de-

 

vote full time to academic assim-

# The IFC’s Rush Plan:
Constructive Move

ilation during the first six weeks of

school, and they would be provided
with a more realistic picture of
campus fraternity life minus the

glitter of Rush Week.
More Strenuous Rushing

On the other hand, the new pro-
posal would call for a much more
strenuous rushing period on the part
of the upperclassmen. The mad run
to create good impressions on the
freshmen and to attract as many of
the most desirable rushees as pos-
sible would require six weeks in-
stead of one. Social budgets would
run rampant—and houses _ that
couldn’t afffford to throw big parties
for the whole campus would be in
an uneasy position.

Occasions for dirty rushing would
arise much more often than they do
under the present system. The stip-
ulations that upperclassmen keep
away from the dormitory and the
Commons would be extremely hard
to enforce, and the definition of what
constitutes open parties and formal
rushing would have to be much
better than they are in the propo-
sal as it stands now.

Benefits Outweigh Hazards

However, when one considers both
sides of the proposal objectively, it
is easy to see that the benefits far
outweigh the hazards. This is true
for more than just the obvious rea-
sons,

We are all aware of the faculty
dissatisfaction of the social situa-
tion at Washington and Lee as re-
lated to fraternities. Up until now,
the IFC has made only feeble and
unrealistic attempts to arrive at a
compromise. Because of this, we
have witnessed several “anti-fra-
ternity” actions this year on the part
of the faculty.

These serve to point out one
thing, primarily. That is that, wheth-
er we like it or not, ultimate author-
ity is not ours. We are free to reg-
ulate ourselves only as long as we
do just that, and do it with more in
mind than just the benefit of the
social fraternity.

If we fail to compromise now, and
refuse to arrive at some sort of
constructive program which meets
with faculty approval, we might as
well kiss the fraternity system good-
bye. We cannot continue to disre-
gard the administration, because
they aren’t going to let us get away
with it any longer.

At last the IFC has met the de-
mands of the Hill. The proposal is
a sound and constructive one, which
apparently will work for the benefit
of everybody concerned. We must
now pass this' resolution, and
accept the challenge of student
government that has ben issued. If
we refuse to compromise now, we
may not be given the choice of a
compromise later.

 

In Defense
Of Beer Rallies
Dear Sir,

This letter is in defense of beer
rallies; but I'm afraid Mr. Slater, in
last Friday’s article, is one up on
me from the start because I can’t
find anything by Leo Tolstoy (or for
that matter, Kafka) that defends
beer or the attitudes conducive to
beer drinking.

With the knowledge that no lit-
erary giants back me up I'd like
to strike out on my own and ig-
nore the lack of authority which
always lends such a conclusive air to
arguments such as these.

Mr. Slater seems to deplore the
lack of support the Glee Club and
the Brass Choir received at the
hands of the students, and even re-
marks that he was “proud” to say
that he did not attend the beer rally.

According to Bearded Prophets

Why proud? Is it a matter of pride
to draw away from a student party
that is organized for fun and at-
tended in this same spirit? Does Mr.
Slater consider the students who
attended the beer rally uncouth,
and thus is he proud at separating

 

himself from the uncultured, apa-
thetic (I throw this last word in be-
cause it’s such a good one to bat
aruond,, and I’ve been told by beard-
ed prophets that it sums up all the
evils in the school) and identifying
himself with the elite that attended
this Spring Music Concert?

I don’t consider the Glee Club or
the Brass Choir as detrimental to the
University. Quite the opposite—they
are very valid organizations that
deserve recognition; however, I
can’t see the point in blasting W&L
students for taking more interest in
a beer party.

Are Beer Drinkers Degenerates?

Because a student prefers to go out
and drink with his friends and dis-
cuss whatever he damn pleases does
not mean he’s a degenerate. Many
students, myself included, look upon
beer rallies such as this last one as
excellent opportunities to drink and
talk with boys from other frater-
nities. Outside of the classroom this
is one of the few times we all have
a chance to get together.

Nor do I think most students look
at drink as their god or guide post.
There are a few, I know, but this
is mostly a matter of immaturity and
even those few soon grow out of
it.

 

‘Mainly Relax Themselves’

I think most students go out to
have a good time, They drink, talk
with their friends, raise some hell
at times, but they mainly relax
themselves.

I cannot see enjoyment as a symp-
tom of energy evily applied. Why
should this be a “sickness of atti-
tude,” Mr. Slater? Why, Mr. Slater,
do you say, “It will be a profound
relief, and no regret at all for me
when I enter a sober and saner
world; leaving behind these half-
hearted student guzzlers to stew in
their own vomit.”?

We certainly have stewed in yours
for long enough.

Respectfully,
PAUL B. CLEMENCEAU

Praise For ‘Big Clique

Dear Editor,

When Bill Lowry’s Protest came
out in favor of the University Party’s
candidates before the recent elec-
tion, many people believed conces-
sions had been made to the NFU’s
in order to get their vote.

This belief may or may not be
proven by the decision of the Uni-

 

versity party to run Steve Henry |

Letters Defend Rally, Discuss Politics

and Bill Noell for office in the forth-
coming class elections. It really
doesn’t matter.

The important thing is that the two
men have proven themselves to be
extremely capable and will do a fine
job if elected. The NFU’s can fur-
nish some good men and, although
this is too early to be speaking of
trends, I hope the University Party
has begun one by running Henry
and Noell.

Sweeps Trian gular Meet

The Washington and Lee track team ran away with a
triangle meet with Elon and East Carolina here Tuesday scor-
ing 94 1/3 points. East Carolina was second with 44 1/3
points and Elon was third with 31 1/3 points. In the sixteen
events Washington and Lee took eleven first places, and with

these two victories the team brought*

it’s record to 6-1.

Skip Essex raced to a 50,0 victory
in the 440 and Jim Hickey earned
a win by burning up a hundred
yards in 9.8 seconds, his best time
this year. Hickey’s school record is
9.7 seconds, established last year.
Distance runner Mike Shank won
the half mile and placed second in
the mile. Since Mike felt the need
for more exercise, he went on to run
the two mile unofficially.

Robin Kell added 10 points to the
team’s effort by easily out-jumping
his competitors in the high jump and
in the hop, step, and jump. John
Pearson, too, was a double winner
in the high and low hurdles. Henry
Sackett scored nine points with a
first place in the broad jomp and a
second place in the hop, step, and
jump.

Other winners were Dave Munroe
in the shot-put, Dave Callaway in
the pole vault, and freshman Ken
Boiarsky in the javelin. Coach Mc-
Laughlin states that Boiarsky has
excellent potential.

Saturday the track team winds up
it’s season by going to Lynchburg
for the state meet. Everyone on the
team will attend the meet. Jim
Hickey will be defending his 100
yard dash title.

meet:

Rain Halts
Tennis Match

The Generals’ tennis team was
stopped short of a win today as the
rain interrupted their match with
Hampden-Sydney there.

When the match finally was stop-
ped, the netmen had a 2-1 lead
over their opponents. Captain John
Baker, who has been having difficul-
ty with his game this season, drop-
ped the first match to Hatcher of
Hampden-Sydney, 6-2, 6-4.

The two wins of the day were reg-
istered in the number two and three
positions. Freshman Randy Jones
and Jim DeYoung playing their usu-
al fine tennis beat their men, but
not without a certain amount of dif-
ficulty. Jones came out on top of
a three set match, 4-6 7-5, 7-5;
and DeYoung, who breezed through
the first set, 6-1, found it hard win-
ning the second, 8-6.

Both Jim Mell and Bud Hollman
had captured the first sets from
their opponents, 6-3 and 6-4 respec-
tively.

This Friday the team plays Bridge-
water on the home courts at 2:30.
Then the following Tuesday, the
Generals travel to Charlottesville
to meet their arch-rival, the Uni-
versity of Virginia.

Four Errors
Give Victory
To Tigers

The Washington and Lee baseball

team suffered a 10-5 setback at Wil-!§

son Field on Tuesday at the hands!
of Hampden-Sydney.

Going into the seventh inning,’
Coach Joe Lyles’ nine was behind
5-4, but due to five hits and five
runs by H-S, assisted by four W&L

errors, the Tigers had plenty of
room to breathe with a 10-4 lead.
Mason McGowin, the _ starting

pitcher for the Generals, lasted only
3 1/3 innings, and was replaced by
Phil Sharp after giving up four
walks, four runs and four hits while
recording three strike outs.

Pitchers on Parade \%

Nearly the entire pitching staff |

made an appearance as Sharp was gee

hooked in the sixth and replaced by |§

Louie Paterno, who lasted only an
inning being replaced by Brice Gam-
ber who finished the game. Coach
Lyles was pleased with Gainber’s
performance, saying that “Brice ap-
peared more relaxed with more con-
trol than he’s shown the last few
games.”

Jim Russ and Bob Williams led the

hitting attack for the Generals with | |

two hits apiece. Russ connected for

two singles in three at bats, and|}

Williams collected a triple and a
single. Ned Hobbs and Park Gilmore
each collected a single also.
Hampden-Sydney’s eleven hit at-
tack was led by Charlie Cook who
belted out a double and two singles.
Coach Lyles said that Tuesday’s
game was an example of the tough
luck which the Generals have en-
countered throughout the season. He
added that “when the pitchers are
on the hitters aren’t, and visa versa.”
Another problem is that stolen bases
by the opposition are hurting tre-
mendously. Finally, Lyles said that
his big hitters, Russ, Hobbs, and
Monier, aren’t coming up with the
RBIs when they’re vitally needed.
The teams record now stands at
0-7, but hopes are high that the
team will get in the win column
this weekend when they play Wil-
liam and Mary on Friday and the
University of Richmond on Saturday.

Vardaman Warms-up For Match

Linkmen Defeat Colonials;
Season Record Now At 4-3

The Washington and Lee golf team
scored an impressive 614-14 victory
over George Washington on Tues-
day. The out-matched team from
George Washington arrived with
only five players, necessitating a
change in procedure.

Jack Vardaman tied in individual
play which gave George Washing-
ton their single one-half point. Gran-
tham Couth recorded a very strong
8-6 victory over his opponent and
was team medalist with a 73. {n best

Couch took a 4-3 victory.

In other matches, Ronnie Stewart
copped a 4-3 decision and Steve
Henry won an impressive 7-6 vic-
tory. Best ball won 4-3. In the final
match, Paul McBride defeated his
opponent 3-2.

The high point of the afternoon’s
play came when Stewart and Henry
drove their electric golf cart into
a ditch on the seventh hole.

The team played Bridgewater here
this afternoon in an attempt to im-

 

ball competition, Vardaman and] prove on its 4-3 season record.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Is ‘The Faculty Forcing Rush Changes On Students?

(Continued from page 1)

Dave Montgomery said, “I think
the present system has its weak-
nesses, but at this school it is the
best system you could find.” He
has, however, placed his position
with this third group.

Some students have pointed out
that W&L was rated in the top ten
small men’s colleges back when
there were fraternity combos dur-
ing dance functions and just about
any other time too, and rush was
at the beginning of the year, and
that these things are actually an
integral part of the individual per-
sonality of Washington and Lee.

‘Dirty’ Rushing

One obvious weakness of the
proposed system is that it would
leave the door open to dirty rush-
ing. The IFC committee feels, how-
ever, that the advantages of the
proposal far outweigh the chance

 

that dirty rush might be increased.

The gains from the system would
include “improved academic en-
vironment, abolition of hell week,
and an opportunity for the fresh-
man to orientate himself to the
university’s way of life.”

Also, the IFC would have all

next year to iron out problem areas
which might lead to dirty rush
situations. Some of these problem
areas are whether or not fraterni-
ty parties should be open or closed,
and what kind of dating situations
should be allowed between fresh-
men and fraternity men; what ex-|
tent casual greeting would be car-
ried out on campus, and what
should be done about contact be-
tween the freshmen and fraternity
men in unavoidable situations such
as on the athletic field and in the
gym.

A point of major concern is the

 

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

(Continued from page 2)

to deseribe the power politics of
W&L. Well, this is just so much
horse excrement. I agree with Hugh
Trout that we are flagrantly neglect-
ing our responsibilities to ourselves
and to Washington and Lee.

Super-Saturated with Honor

In a school reputed to be super-
saturated with honor-conscious
gentlemen, it is disgustingly hypo-
critical to see upperclassmen cajole,
coerce, and lie to freshmen in order
to brainwash them into blindly vot-
ing for University Party candidates.
I thought it was obvious that Tim
Ireland was the best man for presi-
dent. I thought it was equally ob-
vious that Meade Christian was the
best man for vice-president. But
it didn’t seem to make any differ-
ence. We weren’t even told that
the University Party slate was the
best; we were just told it was the
one we had to vote for, so we did.

Now that Executive Committee
elections and class elections are com-
ing up, the same thing is happen-
ing all over again. All sorts of pre-
election promises are made. Or, if

they aren’t openly stated, they are
at least hinted at. The kind of prom-
ises I mean are the loaded little
phrases like: “Well, if we are elect-
ed, that will put your house in a|
good position for committee ap-|
pointments.” Every conceivable in-|
ducement is used to bribe ever rybody |
into voting a “straight” ticket.

The white collar gentlemen
Washington and Lee who speak so
idealistically about honor and tra-
dition are just so many hypocrites
wallowing in a bed of self-satisfied
scheming. When I first came here I
saw and felt a solid and sound col-
lege atmosphere with beautiful tra-
ditions and worthwhile objectives.
Now, everything here has become a
meaningless sham. The only time
there is ever any sincerity shown is
at a keg party—and even then I
wonder if everyone is as uproar-
iously drunk and happy as_ they
pretend.

As far as I am concerned, you
can have your studs and you can
keep your cliques and party poli-
tics. I am leaving here next year
because I still believe there might
be some place that isn’t corroded
with sanctimonious hypocrites. God
help America—and the world-—if
there isn’t! A FRESHMAN

Some people will say that if you

that is the case, why hasn’t it hap-

students have had the sense not to

Is there any reason to believe the

IFC Votes
On Rush

The Interfraternity Council took
the first big step toward changing
the W&L fraternity rush procedure
last night when it voted in favor of
the four-week delayed system, 13-4.

The proposed change will be voted
upon again next week when another
two-thirds approval would make the
change a part of the IFC constitu-
tion, pending approval of the faculty.

The only modification made in the
proposed system was an amendment
proposed by Ross Kyger which left
the question of contact between fra-
ternity men and freshmen to be set-
tled by the IFC. The move was made
when the question of dirty rush was
raised in regard to open house par-
ties during the no-rush four week
period at the beginning of school.

The houses opposing the rush
program were Lambda Chi, Pi Phi,
SPE and Beta. Apparently two of
these houses opposed the change per
se while the others objected to cer-
tain of the stipulations included in
the committee report.

Bob Doenges, IFC president, and
George Honts, the committee chair-
man, both expressed their apprecia-
tion of the IFC action last night and
reaffirmed their belief in the pro-
posed system to this reporter.

The vote next week will be fol-

EC Kills Honor
System M ectings

In a brief post election meeting
last night, the Executive Committee
discussed and voted down a pro-
posal that would have placed the
Honor System before the student
body this year for a reaffirmation of
faith.

The measure called for a general
university assembly at which time
the the student body would have
been called upon to reaffirm its be-
lief in the intrinise values of the
Honor System. The Committee re-
jected the move because it felt the
remainder of the year did not allow
sufficient time to prepare and be-
cause this move might prove cum-
bersome to the incoming EC.

A heated debate followed on
whether or not the present EC
should recommend this action to
future committees. No action was
taken on this proposal.

Several committeemen felt the

Honor System was too much a basic
part of this University’s meaning to
be subjected to the vote of a single
generation of students. Others said
that a reaffirmation of one’s faith is
necessary in any system.

The committee also announced last
night that they had passed a recom-
mendation to next year’s EC call-
ing for a “bill of rights” to be in-
cluded in the student body constitu- |
tion. This would see that the Honor |

Is Performance

Noted Musician Selected
To Play At Finals Concert

Fats Domino, one of the great exponents of Rock ’n Roll,
has been signed to perform for this year’s Finals Concert to
be held on Tuesday, June 5, 1962, Steve Galef, President of
the Dance Board, announced today.

Domino, who has sold over
three years, has scored hits with his*
versions of “My Blue Heaven,”
“When My  Dreamboat Comes
Home,” and “Blueberry Hill.”

Fats has often been hailed as one
of the modern music greats. When
asked about the popularity of the
new musical craze of Rock ’n Roll,
Fats explains: “There’s nothing real-
ly new about the music. I’ve been
doing it ever since I can remember,
only we: know it as rhythm and
blues. Actually, it started in New
Orleans fifteen years ago. It comes
straight out of Dixieland Jazz and
has the same beat.”

Composed Own Hits
Many of Fats’ greatest successes
have been with tunes that he com-
posed. They might best be described
as folk songs with a rhythm and

Fletcher Speaks

At Seminar

Dr. Joseph Fletcher will ap-
pear at 7:30 tonight in Lee
Chapel under the joint spon-
sorship of the University Chris-
tian Association and the De-
partment of Religion.

The topic of Dr. Fletcher’s dis-
cussion this evening will be
“Christian Ethics and Nuclear Wea-
pons.” Dr. Fletcher has done ex-
tensive traveling for the purpose of
speaking on this topic.

The attitude with which Dr.
Fletcher approaches his topic should
be of especial interest to the mem-
bers of the School of Commerce and
Business Administration, in that Dr.
Fletcher is currently a member of
the teaching staff of the Harvard
School of Business.

Dr. Fletcher is also Professor of
Christian Social Ethics at the Epis-
copal Theological Seminary in Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts.

Dr. Fletcher is President of the
Human Betterment Association of
America, a member of the Board of
the Massachusetts Planned Parent-
hood League, and a member of the
governmental Business Ethical Ad-
visory Council. He is the author of

 

three books: The Church and In-
dustry, Christianity and Property,
and Morals and Medicine.

Dr. Fletcher received the A.B.

degree from the University of West
Virginia, the B.D. degree from the
Berkerley Divinity School, and the
S.T.D. at Kenyon College. He has
been at the Episcopal
Seminary since 1944,
The committee in charge of to-
night’s seminar is composed of Dr.

blues beat. Like all folk songs, the
important thing for Fats is that they
all tell a story. He gets his titles
from colloquial expressions that
have become a part of everyday
speech, like “Ain’t That a Shame?”
“Poor Me,” and “I’m in Love Again.”
As he puts it: “I write tunes about
what people say. Whatever you say,
if it sounds catchy, I put it in a
tune. Sometimes I'll be talking to a
friend, and he’ll say some thing that
sounds good, so I'll call out, ‘Put that
down, it’s a song’.”

An entertainer like Fats doesn’t
just “happen.” His talent is the
result of a lifetime of hard work
and application. He was born An-
toine Domino on February 26,
1928, in New Orleans. Although he
was the only one of nine children
to show an interest in music, the
family was not an unmusical one.
His father was a violinist and his
uncle, Harry Verett, had played
with such famous Jazz aggrega-
tions as those of Kid Ory and
Oscar Celestine.

Fats first displayed his musicai
precosity when he was barely out
of short-pants. One of his cousins
left an old upright piano with the
family. The youngster was fascinated
by the instrument and, in no time,
he was able to pick out simple melo-
dies on it.

Singing at Ten

By the time Fats was ten vears
old, he was playing and singing for
pennies in the local Honky Tonks.
Unfortunately, this early career as a
cabaret entertiner was shortlived.
When he was old enough to get a
proper job, he had to go to work
in a bedspring factory to help sup-
port his family. His daily chores at
manual labor did not deter him from
his ambition to become a musician.

Fats rapidly developed into a
musician’s musician. All of the
players in town got into the habit
of dropping in to hear him beat
out those rhythm and blues. It was
because of his popularity with his
fellow artists that Lew Chud,
president of Imperial Records,
first heard him. On a talent-scout-
ing trip to New Orleans, he heard
nothing but great things about a
new musician named Fats Domino,
so he went out to the roadhouse
to listen for himself, After a few
numbers he knew tht all the talk
about the pianist-singer had not
been exaggerated and immediately
signed him to a recording contract.
At 29, Fats Domino has managed to

become one of the top artists in his
field. He still makes his home in
New Orleans. He is happily married
and the father of six children. His
five-year-old son is

Students Elect

The results of last night’s

Committeeman show that there is still a degree of sensibility left

in the Student Body.

It seems that the Student Body finally opened their eyes
and cast party politics aside for their own best interests. For
the most part, the elections were based upon what they should
be—qualifications and not party interests. This resulted in the
election of a qualified and capable Executive Committee.

Albee’s Plays Emphasize Strongly
The Hollowness Of American Life

In its final production of the sea-
son, the Troubadour Theater will
present Edward Albee’s two plays
“The American Dream” and “The
Zoo Story,” beginning Wednesday,
May 9, at 8:30 p.m.

The plays will be running through
Saturday, May 12 and reservations
must be made beforehand, Dr. Cecil
Jones, director of the production, an-
nounced,

The two plays, each one hour in
length, portray two rather different
tones. “The American Dream” is de-
scribed by Dr. Jones as “a comedy
with serious intent, exposing the
vapidness and lack of any real values
in the average American life.”

“The Zoo Story,” on the other
hand, is a more serious and in some
ways more realistic piece. With its
setting in Central Park, New York,
the play concerns a man seeking to
lead a rather ordered, well-regu-
lated, and relatively empty existence.
The drama is triggered off when he
is confronted by another man who
recognizes that this sort of life is
futile and unproductive.

The five-member cast of “The
American Dream” features three fe-
male parts. “Mommy” is played by
Mrs. Anne Emmons, who is making
her debut on the Troubadour Thea-
ter and is the wife of Dr. Lyman
Emmons of the W&L Biology De-
partment.

 

Election May Day Will Add Meaning
To ‘Important’ Spring Class Elections

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

I spent this past wekend basking
in the sun at one of the finer neigh-
boring girls’ schools in celebration of
the rites of spring, and while watch-
ing all of the lovely girls cavort
around a great big May pole several
ideas passed through my head in
rapid succession. One of the least in-
teresting of these random thoughts
was the question of why W&L prob-
ably dosen’t have a May Day cele-
bration.

After thinking about that for a
while

sure you'll agree that
there isn’t a very

I'm

good answer. Of
course we have
Spring Dances,

and there are in-
dividual forays in-
. to the hills to wel-
come the arrival
of Dionysius back
on the scene, but
there really isn’t
a formal apprecia-
tion and pianned
ceremony here at

   

Craven
W&L.

On first considering the problem
of staging such a show here, I
thought it might be impossibie.
There are, of course, all sorts of
scurrilous implications which could
be made about May Day at a men’s
school. But after watching the pro-
gram at the girls’ school for a
while I saw that this didn’i bother
them at all. As a maiter of fact,
they sort of played it up; so with

of good breeding, I think we can
throw one on here.

About the toughest difficulty to
surmount in staging a May Day here
at W&L will not be finding partici-
pants, but rather when to schedule
the thing. We all know, naturally,
that May Day must by rights come
in May, and we all know what a
jam-packed, fun-filled month May
is already. So we'll either have to
eliminate something that already
exists, or force a combination. Elim-
ination is obviously out as an answer,
because we should know by now that
if something already exists then there
must have been a reason for it, and
so it is going against tradition to
abolish it. So I recommend some sort
of combination of a W&L May Day
with an already established ritual.

Probably the  best-established
ritual here on campus is the stu-
dent election. Fortunately this
comes in May, and so we've al-
ready got the machinery which can
be readily adapted to fit a May
Day celebration. Now the Big
Seven officers are pretty busy
without having further duties
foisted off on them, and _ besides,
Big Seven officers shouldn't be
elected on looks alone. Therefore
the place to go is class elections.
If these can be molded to fit a
May Day format our lives will he
doubly enriched come Election
May Day (which is as good a name
as any, and one I propose for adop-
tion).

With the celebration of Election
May Day W&L will reap many

 

taste and tact and loss of displays

to class offices. In the first place,
the historian of each class will finally
have something to write about. This
in itself justifies the whole thing.
In the next place, the more re-
sponsible class offices of president.
vice president and secretary will have
something to talk about at class
meetings. Instead of having to in-
vent business (“We're gathered here
today to discuss the role of the jun-
ior class in the modern world...”),
these men will have to formulate
definite plans and make responsible
decisions (“O.K., you guys, today

May pole should be set up. Are we
going to have it on the front lawn
in view of any stray tourist, or will
we put it over at VMI and blame it
on them?”).

The biggest advantage of insti-
tuting a May Day to coincide with
class elections, however, will be
that students will finally be com-
pelled (and self-compelled, at
that) to get to know the candi-
dates. The posters on campus will
finally be looked at with a dis-
criminating eye as students have
real issues (Aquiline features vs.
All-American boy type look) to
choose between. This will bring
W&L politics out of the ivory
tower of the clique meeting and
back to the level of the people.
It can’t happen soon enough.

Long live the May Queen of W&L,
and may he lead the Senior Class
to glory forever. The three vice
presidents, of course, will form the

May Court and be the attendanis.

“Grandma” is played by Mrs. Ruth
Browne, housemother of PiK.A, who
starred in the recent production of
“Don Juan.” “Mrs, Barker” is por-
trayed by Josephine Unger, head
of the art department of Southern
Seminary, who is making her third
appearance in the Troubadour Thea-
ter.

Playing the two male parts are
Nick Denton, a Phi Psi junior, who
as “The Young Man” is making his
first appearance on the Troubadour
stage, and Andy Adelson, a junior,
portraying “Daddy.”

In “The American Dream,” Albee
is writing of a typical American
family who have formed a rather
meaningless interrelationship in
which all feeling is dulled by an
inane dialogue.

The only strong character in the
play is “Grandma,” who serves as
the connecting link for the other
four characters. She alone has some
glimpse into the absurdity of the
family’s ethos.

“Daddy” is acquiescent, shallow,
and unthinking. “Mommy” is the
same way, and comes out as a wo-
man completely infatuated with hats,
clubs, and “society.”

“Mrs. Barker” is somewhat of an
appendage to the family, impulsive-
ly getting involved in everyone's af-
fairs but her own.

“The Young Man” represents the
American dream” incarnate with his
dashing Hollywood appearance. Yet
in actuality, he has only his physical
beauty, which can not make up for
the void in his heart and soul.

Only Absolute Madness Could Prompt Someone
To Attend A Local School's May Day Celebration

By SANDY FENN

Brother! I’m just a fool, that’s
what I am. I’m a miserable victim
_ of circumstances,

Six of my most

even brought me a fifth of scotch
last Wednesday and got me loaded
in an attempt to talk me out of my
madness. They told me that terrible
things had happened before... but
even in my drunken stupor I raved,
I accused them of being traitors to
the cause of friendship and brother-
hood, and I smashed my empty fifth
over the head of my roommate. I
refused to admit the clear light of
reason and practical experience—and
I went to May Day.

Why I did it, Pll never really
know. I must have been nuts. No

of an Orangutan would have done
a thing like that—but I did it. Late
Saturday morning I jumped into my

even questioning the sanity cf my
actions.

Now I thought this May Day pro-
gram was some sort of a modern
Nature festival... what was all this
about a formal dance? I had en-
visioned an invigorating, barefoot
romp through the sunny fields with
my beautiful date—you know Cor-
rina’s going a-Maying and all that
sort of thing...Instead I find my-
self on the way back to Lexington
to get my dinner jacket, which I
had forgotten.

Nevertheless, I returned in time to
see most of the festivities. First the
choir sang, then there were speeches
on the lawn, then the choir sang
again, then the girls danced around
the Maypole, then the choir sang
again, and then I passed out at the
feet of the Dean of Students.

The school doctor argued that I
was in a state of intoxication, but
my rebuttal was that I had suffered
a heat stroke while standing in the
sun listening to the blasted choir
for two hours.

As the sun dipped low in the
West, I was released from ine in-
firmary and rejoined my cate for a
sumptuous repast of raw fried chick-
en, soggy potato salad, and squashej
cup cakes.

The formal dance that night was
a huge success...my beautiful date

“It’s great to retire undefeated,”

'Robrecht said. “Some people want

me to go on, however, but I’ve

Robrecht started his boxing career
in Plainfield, New Jersey, where he
began working in the local YMCA.

“When I came to W&L,” Robrecht
said, “the remnants of the scholar-
ship boys were still here.”

“I played football in high school |
and wanted to play in college, but
I was just too small to compete |
with the scholarship boys.

A short time later Robrecht wrote |
the Roanoke Times to find out if}
there were any boxing clubs in the |
area. The Times told him about the |
Roanoke Police Athletic Club and |
Robrecht launched his boxing career. |

Robrecht had only three fights in
his undergraduate days, two in his |
sophomore year and one in his senior |
year.

His third fight, however, earned
him the Virginia Golden Gloves mid-
championship in_ the
novice division. Robrecht decisioned |
ex-Marine Bill Fleishman of Coving- |
ton, Va., in a two-round bout at
Roanoke for the title.

But Robrecht had to stage one of
his best comebacks to whip Fleish-
man.

Fleishman cut Robrecht’s eye in
the first round and almost scored a
TKO, but Robrecht hung on and
pounded Fleishman into submission
in the second round.

The fight was stopped after Ro-
brecht began to hit Fleishman at will.

Since entering law school, Robrecht
has had 11 fights, including Marine
Corps opposition.

‘I'm proud of having four vic-|
tories of Marine opposition,” Ro-|
brecht said. “You know, those Ma-
rine boys are usually considered
pretty tough.”

Robrecht has conquered three Ma- |

rines from Quantico and one from}

Camp LeJeune.

However, he still

In addition to his Golden Gloves
victory, Robrecht scored a unani-

a lot in experience and style in my
fights with him,”

Robrecht answers this easily.

He keeps in shape by doing two

in
the gym in the afternoon, plus spar-
ring when he can find an opponent.

“My big problem here is the lack
of sparring partners,” Robrecht said.
“To keep in good shape you have
to have a great deal of sparring. I

just haven't been able to get

After six years of hard work,

Robrecht has fought his way to the

of Virginia.

Thus ends the spectacular career

Walker Denounces W&L;
Labels It ‘High School’

Editor:

Having been subjected to a barrage
of outraged illogic which has ap-
peared in this paper over the past
few weeks, I would like to take this
opportunity to support the faculty
in their recent actions. In fact,, I
not only commend them for their
recent actions, but I encourage them
to take more action along these lines.

Sudents have been screaming late-
ly that the Hill is anti-fraternity,
and that they are encroaching on
student freedom. The example of this
was George Honts’ article in the
April 24 issue of the R-t P. I would
like to remind Mr. Honts and other
students that the University exists
for the benefit of the students, and
the students do not exist for the
benefit of the institution. Hence,
the Administration has the right to
take any action that it deems neces-

sary. It has given the students a
great deal of freedom in certain

areas, and this is laudable. However,
the Administration has the right to
deprive the students of that free-
dom whenever they feel that the
students have abused it or have
shown themselves ineapable of using
it responsibly.

I agree with the faculty members
who stated that only the faculty
can judge what best for the
university. At present the students
are incapable of making such an
judgment. The students
are committed to defending and pre-

was not enough to hold the Balti-
more attack. Team effort and good
individual performances by Balti-
more’s Stewart Harrison, Laverghet-
ta, and Price kept the attack on
W&L goalie Ray Miller continual,
putting the half-time score at 10-4.
Charlie Gummey and John McDan-
iel accounted for the W&L first half
scoring with two goals apiece.

With their comfortable lead, Bal-
timore replaced their regulars with
substitutes in the third quarter and
renewed their scoring with seven
goals. Lack of W&L team-work and
a good Baltimore defense led by
Laverghetta, kept the General at-
tack at a stand-still. The score going
into the final quarter stood at 17-4.

In the final period W&L was
forced to be satisfied with match-
ing the Baltimore scoring as Fres-
man Caroll Klingelhofer accounted

Lynchburg Falls
To W&L Golfers

By AL JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
golf team defeated Lynchburg
college 6 1/2-2 1/2 Monday
afternoon at the Bonnsboro

Country Club.

The Generals Jack Vardaman fired
a four over par 76 to take medalist
honors while tying his opponent in
match play.

Couch Loses

Also in the first foursome was
W&L’s Grantham Couch who lost to
the Hornet’s Jim O’Meara two up.

In the second foursome Ronnie
Stewart defeated Lynchburg’s John
Caldwell three up and Will Lee of
W&L easily overcame George John-
son.

Three Up

Steve Henry and Paul McBride
also defeated their Lynchburg op-
ponents, both finishing three holes
up.

The best ball in each foursome
ended in a tie in the first and third
groups, but W&L won in the second.

Final Match

This match marked the final con-
test of the season for the linkmen.
They posted a slate of five wins and
three losses.

Netmen Trounce Hapless Eagles;

Prepare To Face Tough Virginia

The Washington and Lee tennis
team trounced Bridgewater, 9-0, on
the home courts last Friday. The
generals, minus the services of their
two best players, Captain John Bak-
er and frosh Randy Jones, played
flawless tennis, refusing to give up
one set to the hapless Eagles from
Bridgewater.

In the first two singles posi-
tions, DeYoung and Mell won by
identical scores of 6-0, 6-1. Bud
Hollman, playing number three
shut out Dave Hersch of Bridge-
water.

Freshman Lindsey Short in the
number one four position had the
closest match of the day, beating
Gene Higgs 6-3, 7-5.

Howie Busse shut out his op-

 

ponent in the number five slot while
Steve Hibbard won easily, 6-1, 6-0,
at number six singles.

Doubles Victories

The Generals won the doubles in
short order, allowing Bridgewater
only two games in three matches.
DeYoung and Hollman beat Brown
and Aiken, 6-0, 6-1. Mell and Short
at number two doubles, and Busse
and Hibbard at number three, won
by identical scores of 6-0, 6-1.

Trackmen Comments On Excuses

By ANDY KILPATRICK

Trackmen, as everybody knows,
don’s always win. And there are a
million reasons (according to the
runners themselves) why _ they
don’t—reasons which are sometimes
more interesting than the events
themselves.

Coach Lord has a collection of the
choice excuses handed down through
the years by athletes for their sub-
par performances. He calls this col-
lection his Handy Alibi Sheet, which
gives the athletes an opportunity to
select the best possible alibi for
any occasion.

Lord’s list provides for every-
thing. The athlete in need of an
alibi may have started his kick too
soon, may have started it voo late,
may have trained too little, or may

 

have overtrained. He may need
wheat oil germ, then again he may
need yogurt. His girl friend inay
have been unfriendly the night be-
fore the race, or (more than likely)
she was too friendly.

One of the most useful alibis in-
vented is: “I’m building up slowly
for four years from now.” Another
excuse for a less than desirable per-
formance on a particular day is, “I’m
saving myself for . (An
upcoming race, which actually means
a house party or Sem date).

The prima donna (every track-
man) will complain that his spikes
were too long or too short, that foot-
ing was too hard or too soft, or that
it was too warm or too cold. An
alibi just out is: “I don’t have red
shoes,” a reason for several races

The big problem for some ath-
letes is that they can’t run when
they’re ahead. Then there are ath-
letes who can’t run when they’re
behind. And there are athletes who
can’t run.

One topper in Lord’s collection is
“I wanted to see what the other
place medals were like.” And there
are runners who don’t force a race
because the medals are cheap, any-
way.

Other perfectly legitimate excuses
are: “I don’t like organized athlet-

his first competitive meet), I only

Some criticism has been voiced in the new vlan. However.
any plan, no matter how good, is bound to have some opposi-

serving the existing order especiai-
ly in regard to fraternities. Oonly
the faculty can make an objective
decision in this area.
I have read repeatedly in this
newspaper that Washington and Lee
is one of the finest colleges in the
nation. Frankly, I feel that this is
a palpable lie. The students here are
dedicated to “having a good time,”
and are opposed to any innovation
which might make it harder to at-
tain this goal. When compared to
such colleges as Amherst, Oberlin,
and Swarthmore where intellectual-
ism is virulent, Washington and Lee
is nothing more than post-graduate
high school. For these reasons I too,
like Spud Slater and the anonymous
freshman whose letter appear last
week, am leaving next year for a
saner, more mature world.
Most sincerely,

(Continued from page 2)

“The Zoo Story” is contrasted to
“The American Dream” in that it is
not so much of a caricature as a
penetrating study of character. Once
again, the problem is that of inte-
communication.

“Peter,” portrayed by junior John
Dunnell, is a man of about 40, an
executive in a _ small publishing
house, a typical family man for the
upper middle class, a rigid conform-
ist, living always by the rule.

“Jerry,” played by junior Tim
Morton, is about 35, a non-conform-
ist who is bored with his isolation
from others, and above all obsessed
by the hope of achieving personal
contact with another.

Albee, the extremely promising
playwright of the two plays, has
been in Lexington since last Wednes-
day assisting in the production.
Visiting the campus in the capacity
of a Glasgow Professor, Mr. Albee
has been attending dress rehearsals
and offering helpful advice on ex-
plaining the overall concept of the
play as well as the performance of
the specific roles.

Book Store Will Carry
Full Line Of Paperbacks

By MALCOLM MORRIS

The University Supply Store has
announced plans to enlarge its book-
store selection to include a full line
of paperback books by next Sep-
tember, and a partial line by May 21.

James L. Sumner, supply store
manager, said the project will be on
an experimental basis, in accord-
ance with a trend on the college to-
tody.

The store will carry titles from
such publishers as Colliers, Doubl-
day-Anchor, and Barnes and Noble.
Plans include several new racks
devoted to the paperbacks.

A faculty committee headed by
Dr. David Sprunt has supervised the
selection of books to be made avail-
able.

Each department and the profes-
sors within the department choose
the paperbacks which are of value
in its subject range. A wide range
of topics is expected to be carried.

Dr. Sprunt said that the paper-
backs will range over and above text
books. We are trying, he said, to
make available books of interest and
also of value to students.

The books will average from 65c
to $1.50 in cost, said Sumner.

 

Paperbacks Boom

The “paperback revolution” on
college campuses has vastly increas-
ed the number of books bought by
students, according to the New York
Times “Book Review” of January 14,
1962. In an article on college read-
ing the magazine pointed out that
the majority of top-selling books on
campuses are in paperbacks.

The fact that college bookstores
are now the best markets for these
paperbacks has been prompted by
their wide range of topics, availabil-
ity and inexpensiveness.

J. D. Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye
is generally regarded as the most
popular book among college stu-
dents, with Salinger also considered
the most popular author.

On Ivy League campuses Gold-
ings paperback Lord of the Flies,
a work which has found a great fol-
lowing at W&L, is running a close
second to Salinger. Albert Camus
and his plague are also extremely
popular.

Good translations of foreign books
into paperbacks have given a great
impetus to the popularity of such
writers as Camus, Pasternak, Satre,
Ayme, and Moronte.

 

Hobbs, Portnoy, Wright, Yeary
Receive ROTC Commendations

The ROTC department announced
yesterday the presentation of awards
to cadets who have distinguished
themselves by personal proficiency
or contributions to their units.

Awarded the Department of the
Army Superior Cadet Ribbon, “in
recognition of outstanding leader-
ship, scholastic achievement, and
proficiency in military training,”
were Ned Hobbs, senior; Arthur
Portnoy, junior; Frank Wright, soph-
omore; and John Yeary, freshman.
These were made by President Cole,
at yesterday’s Awards Day Parade.

Samuel Block, junior, was pres-
ented the Association of the United
States Army ROTC Gold Medal,
“in recognition of outstanding lead-
ership, academic excellence, general
proficiency in military training, and
contribution to the Washington and
Lee ROTC program.

Four seniors were awarded the
Virginia Society Sons of the Amer-
ican Revolution Medal, for “out-

 

standing example, general _profi-
ciency, and contribution to the
Washington and Lee ROTC program.
They are Dave Callaway, Allyn
Kantor, Harold Curran, and Jerry
Hyatt.

The Reserve Officers Association
of the United States Medal was
awarded “in recognition of outstand-
ing leadership, academic excellence,
general proficiency in military
training, and contribution to the
Washington and Lee ROTC program”

to three juniors: Henry Knight
(Gold Medal), Peter Francese
(Silver Medal), and Charles Mc-

Cord (Bronze Medal).

The Chicago Tribune ROTC Medal
“for outstanding achievement in mil-
itary science as evidenced by their
having amassed the highest grades
in their respective couse year” was
awarded to James Starkey, senior;
Bob Payne, junior; Robert Lee, soph-
omore; and George Allen, freshman.
The first two received Gold Medals
and the second two Silver Medals.

Troub Review

Tim Morton
Outstanding
In ‘Zoo Story’

The Troubadours gave the W&L
audience a good introduction to the
plays of Edward Albee in their per-
formances of The American Dream
and The Zoo Story Wednesday night.

They played The American Dream
as a hilarious bit of social satire,
which it is. But they were so funny
that the audience laughed it way
past most of the sordid reality be-
hind the comedy.

Tim Morton, with able backing
from John Dunnell, turned in the
best performance of the night in
The Zoo Story. Morton, in the role
of Jerry, exercised a sure hold on
the audience as he described his at-
tempts to communicate with a sing-
ularly nasty dog.

 

By contrast with the sure manner
in which Morton and Dunnell play-
ed to each other in The Zoo Story,
the players in The American Dream
seemed to lack coordination. Mrs.
Lyman Emmons, as Mommy, and
Miss Josephine Unger, as Miss Bark-
turned the normal social

er, con-
versation upside down.
The comic parts were so over-

played, however, that the audience
never seemed to realize that the
play deals with a couple who are
incapable of human love or friend-
shop, who mutilate their adopted
child and ignore an aging grand-
parent. Accordingly, when Nick
Denton came on, splendidly hand-
some and empty as the former child’s
twin, grown up and suffering spirit-
usually the physical loss of his broth-
er, the audience was unprepared to
accept the basic reality of the situa-
tion.

The Zoo Story is a more conven-
tional play than The American
Dream, and the audience, who ex-
pected good performances from Mor-
ton and Dunnell, almost shook off
the effects of their surfeit laughter in
the first performance,

Performances tonight and tomor-
row night of the two plays will
give people who haven’t yet seen
them a chance to do so, They are
both enjoyable and disturbing.

and spoiled young man,” and

on ——**the nation is becoming aware of

having been deceived by him.

‘Anathema to Democracy’

The “infinite and magnificent con-
ceit” of Kennedy and his govern-
ment has brought them to concen-
trate power and privilege in the
capital, said the Texas Republican.
The New Frontier regime is “based
on the accumulation of power and
its arbitrary exercise.” Kennedy, he
said, has no confidence “in the abili-
ty of people to meet their problems.”

This tendency to marshall and dis-
tribute all resources in and from
Washington was called an anathema
to democracy; the government is
becoming less responsible to the peo-
ple, said the Texan.

In facing down the steel industry
recently, Kennedy acted like a petu-
lant child, said Tower, who called
the rise in steel prices “justified.”
Whether the raise was right or
wrong, he said, it was wrong for
the President to bludgeon steel with
the power of the government.

Tower felt that Kennedy has
proven himself anti-business, and
| that the President would not be
likely to use such brutal tactics in
dealing with labor unions.

Tower called the administration’s
medicare plan a “cruel deception”
and another way to inject Federal
control into a realm where it does
not belong. The Senator described
the U.S. medical system as the best
in the world, and sees no reason to
tamper with it.

Makes FDR Look Reactionary

Kennedy’s administration has gone
so far in centralization that FDR
now compares as a_ conservative,
Tower said. It’s a pretty sad state of
affairs when “FDR starts looking like
a reactionary,” he said.

Tower said he feels a growing
awareness in America that we are
going too fast in this direction, and
a growing determination not to con-
tinue in it is “particularly manifest
in young people.” The Senator sees
a “rising tide of conservatism on
the college campus.”

Today’s youth also, he said, are
| moving forward in a search for op-
| portunity, not security. The impres-
| sive growth of America, said Tower,
is traceable to the opportunity of-
fered here; this system is what con-
servatives seek to preserve.

In a brief comment on the con-
servative nature, Tower character-
ized his thinking as dynamic rather
than static.

Friday Edition

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

IFC Rush Plan:
An Appraisal

The IFC’s proposal has passed one vote, and must now be
passed again. The proposal certainly has its merits, but it is not
without its faults.

 

As we understand it, the new plan is designed to alleviate
the strain that early rush imposes on incoming freshmen. It
is argued that the excitement and, quite often, the disappoint-
ment of the present rush system serves to start the freshman
off with a warped sense of values. This argument is, of course
a generalization, but it probably contains more than a little
truth. The IFC’s plan, with its period of adjustment, would
help rectify this problem.

The new plan, however, could very well create more prob-
lems than it would solve. Like it or not, fraternities are a fact
of life on this campus, for they are the primary means by
which a student may become acquainted with the characteris-
tics that distinguish Washington and Lee from other schools.
This is an important service, but it is one which has been ser-
iously impaired since the advent of the Commons three years
ago. Fraternity influence over freshmen has been irreparably
damaged simply because the individual house must now wait
a full year to effectively “assimilate” new students.

The new rush plan could concievably aggravate this sit-
uation. During their first month here, the freshmen will have
virtually no contact with upper-classmen, and, after rush, the
pledge period will be shorter. Fraternities will inevitably exer-
cise less influence over the freshmen, and the result could be
a further weakening of the assimilation process.

Certain members of the faculty feel that the fraternity
social life often conflicts with W&L’s academic life, and they
would like to reduce the influence that fraternities have on
incoming students. But these men seem to ignore the fact that
fraternities provide the framework for the assimilation process
here, and that a substitute for this process must be found if
fraternities are to be deprived of their hold on freshmen. Pre-
sumably, this fact was recognized when the Commons was built,
but, nevertheless, absolutely nothing seems to have been done
about it. As of now, the freshmen live by themselves, eat their
meals by themselves, and attend classes by themselves. They
have no means by which to orient themselves to life at W&L,
for the faculty advisory system provides almost no help, and
they have very little contact with upperclassmen. This year’s
dorm counselors have been complaining of the situation all
year, and Billy Atwell’s article on this page seems to bear out
their conclusions.

Ideally, the weakening of the fraternity hold on freshmen
would allow the faculty to shift the emphasis here from social
pursuits to academic pursuits. The faculty seems to think that
this process would be automatic, that de-emphasis of social life
would of necessity lead to an improvement of the academic
climate.

But the process is by no means automatic. It takes more
than classes six days a week to create an intellectual atmosphere.
There must be constant outside-the-classroom student-faculty
communication, and there must be a general air of intellectual
activity, which would include the best possible outside speakers
and scholars-in-residence. The economics and chemistry de-
partments excepted, student-faculty relations at W&L are re-
markably inadequate, and the outside speaker program, despite
the presence of Mr. Albee and Senator Tower this week, has
been poor this year. The initiative for improvement in these
areas must come from the faculty. If the faculty expects to
improve the academic climate at W&L, then it must take posi-
tive steps to assimilate the freshmen intellectually. The Com-
mons has all but eliminated the power of fraternities in this
area. It’s now up to the faculty.

Our only reservation about the IFC’s proposal is that it
may aggravate the present poor state of freshman assimilation.
If the faculty will accept more responsibility for assimilating
new students, then the threat will be removed, and the new
rush proposal may stand for what it is: a conscientious and
commendable plan to iron out the flaws in the present rush
system. If the faculty will not accept the responsibility, then the
new plan will only make a bad situation worse.

A University Party Jolt

Monday night’s revolt of the University Party majority in
the freshman class shook quite a few people up. It should have.
For upperclassmen have been growing more and more out of
touch with each year’s freshman class since the advent of the
Commons.

The freshmen in the University Party felt, rightly, that they
had had no voice in choosing their candidates for sophomore
class offices. So they just turned against their party candidates,
most of whom were able and well-liked men.

If there has been a failure in the two cliques’ nominating
process, it has been in nominations for freshman and sopho-
more class officers. The reason is that the clique meetings are

run by juniors and seniors with very little freshman or soph- |

omore representation. If the two parties are to be as responsive
to the feelings of the student body as they claim to be, they

 

 

must make greater provision for an underclass voice in their |

councils,

Morgan Condemns Walker

Letter to the Editor:

After thumbing past the beaming
picture of one Antoine “Fats” Dom-
ino on the front page of the Tuesday
R-t P, I discovered a more sombre
section of the paper in the “Letters
to the Editor” column on the next
page. In this rather sickening ex-
ample of the attitude which I fear is
fast becoming dominant at W&L,
the author, one Sam Walker de-
nounces everything from the stu-
dents’ capabilities of reasoning to the
University itself.

The author accuses W&L of being
nothing more than a post-graduate
high school, but in the light of his
arguments, he proves that the oppo -
site is true. He advocates more facul-
try control and suggests that the
faculty alone is capable of making
decisions for the student body. Real-
ly, Mr .Walker, doesn’t that remind
you of the good old days back at
at Home Town High? Or was there
an interest by the students in the
affairs of your high school, which is
apparently a sure sign of weakness
according to your letter? It would
seem to me that as a man becomes
older and more mature, he is more
able to participate directly in the
decisions of his school, not the re-
verse, which Mr. Walker loudly pro-
claims.

Here at W&L, there is, or has been
until recently, an excellent relation-
ship between the university and the
fraternities. It has been a relation-
ship which no other college can
claim because nowhere else has it
been as succesful. The scholastic
life and the social life at W&L have
been considered separate, neither
treading on the territory of the
other. Monday through Friday be-
longed to the Hill and the weekend
was the domain of the Fraternity. In
this way, a balance was achieved
by which both bodies prospered.

Now it seems that the faculty
feels it necessary to over-step its
limits and take fraternity action into
its own hands, giving as excuses
that the students are suddenly in-
capable or that the traditions of
dance weekends might be lost. The
real reason lies, however, in the
increased activity toward raising the
academic standards at W&L to place
W&L in competition with other in-
stitutions of its same size. This is
admirable, but what exists here
now— the union of university and
fraternity—is far more important.
Students apply at W&L because they
expect to find this union, whereas
at many other colleges such as Am-
herst, fraternities are little more than
places to live and study, lacking the

‘An Experience, Not A Play .

 

Albee Discusses Absurd Theatre

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Edward Albee doesn’t look like a
playwright. He’s slender, polite and
friendly, and gives the impression
of an intelligent, moderately con-
servative business man.

He appears alsost strikingly un-
ostentatious. The first thing one
notices about him, and remembers
the longest, is the penetrating stare
he levels at everybody with hard,
iron-gray eyes.

That this man represents a highly
controversial movement in modern
dramatic literature seems (if you'll
pardon the pun) absurd; but Edward
Albee, 34-year-old author of The
Zoo Story, The American D-cam,
and The Death of Bessie Smith, is
one of the most increasingly signi-
ficant protagonists of the Theatre of
the Absurd.

In an informal hotel room inter-
view with members of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi and French professor
Jay Laurence Taylor Tuesday, Albee
talked about himself, the Absurd
Theatre, and other playwrights.

If the play-goer wants to appre-
ciate an Absurd drama, he musé go
“not expecting a play, but expect-
ing an ‘experience’.” Albee said.
“Then you don’t have any percon-

ceptions and can absorb the thing for

 

 

what it is,” he added.

The theatre of the Absurd, in the
main, is an outgrowth of existential-
ist philosophy. Its playwrights deal
with the senselessness of society and
the world, and with man’s trying to
find some meaning where there is
none.

A movement that tries to do some-
thing like this is criticized primarily,
perhaps, for its brutal cynicism and
bitterness. One might expect its
proponents to be unpleasant non-
conformists with long hair and dirty
teeth, who converse in intellectual
ebscurities and falsely erudite ver-
nacular. Albee definitely isn’t one
of these.

Kind of an Explosion

He thinks about a play for a
while—“‘around six months’—and
then does the actual writing in a
relatively short time. The Zoo Story,
which opened Wednesday night at
the Troub Theatre with another
Albee play, The American Dream,
was “kind of an explosion. I didn’t
understand it myself,’ Albee said,
adding somewhat ironically “I have
to learn from others (critics) exact-
ly what I meant.”

The artist’s typical aversion for
critics was pointed out again in
Albee’s answer to an inquiry as to
what writers had influenced him.
“I have been influenced by every-

 

body I have read. Critics are always
saying who has influenced me: I
made a list once and stopped at 23.
Some of them I had never read.’

The Playwrights He Likes

He did say that there are four
20th Century authors whom he pre-
fers over others, these bein: Chek-
hov, Beckett, “the late” O’Neill, and
Brecht.

Someone commented to Albee on
the fact that his plays seemed to be
centered always in America. Ad-
mitting that this was true, he said
there is “an artificiality in writing
about foreigners in something he-
sides their own language.” He went
on to say it might be so that “if
a play is about Frenchmen, it should
be in French. I don’t try to write
about America—I guess it’s just
that I know America and American
problems better; and, after all, a
play can’t be set in limbo: logically,
it must be set someplace.”

Less Naturalistic

In discussing the future of the
Theatre of the Absurd, playwright
Albee felt that the trend weuld be
even more away from naturalistic
techniques. “The whole concept of
reality and illusion will be explored,
and Absurd plays will be less ‘easy’.’

Pressing Problem For Washington & Lee:
Top-Notch Freshmen Make Transfer Plans

By BILL ATWELL

Life at Washington and Lee has
undergone much discussion lately as
to what it should and does mean. An
atmosphere of dissatisfaction has
been noticed, particularly in the
freshman class.

Approximately 25 freshmen left on
their own accord at the end of the
fifst semester; rumor has it that 30
or so will leave at the end of
this semester.

Included in the group that plans
to leave after this semester are four
members of Phi Eta Sigma, of which
two are the number one and two
men scholastically in the freshman
class. Many of the others who won’t
return in the fall are boys with
above 2.0 averages.

Why the Mass Exodus?

Why is there this mass exodus of
seemingly top quality people? In
interviews with several transferring
freshmen, we have tried to learn
what they thought were the strong
and weak points about W&L.

The only man in the freshman
class with a 3.0 last semester was
Charles Osment. He’s leaving, and
his main reason for it is the lack of
necessary courses here in the field
of his planned major, medical re-
search.

 

In addition, however, he feels
there is a definite condition of men-
tal apathy among the student body.
“I don’t think Washington and Lee
can be called an institution of intel-
lectual inquiry where students learn
for the joy and satisfaction of learn-
ing.”

Fraternities at Fault

Osment also believes that the fra-
ternities should emphasize scholas-
tics more than they do at the pres-
ent. “Academics seem to take second
place to social activities,” he added.

When asked about what he saw
good in the University, Osment im-
mediately cited the Honor System
as the best attribute of W&L.

George James is a member of Phi
Eta Sigma, has done research in
English with Dr. Douglas Dav, and
was a member of the succesful W&L
Swimming team.

His leaving has been prompted
by what he calls desire for an urban
environment, as well as a larger
school with more courses in his
chosen field.

Intellectual Apathy

He also has been bothered by “in-
tellectual apathy among the fresh-
men.” He mentioned the social as-
pects of W&L as being over-empha-
sized a great deal.

 

“Bull sessions are stifling because
they seem to revolve around the
same nonsensical topics. I simply
get tired of listening to how niuch
someone can drink before he passes
out.”

The Honor System is the embod-
iment of what James considers to
be the good points of the school.
He, like Osment, expects it to be in
effect no matter where he goes to
school.

Mike Crabill was the second rank-
ed student scholastically in the
freshman class last semester, with
a 2.82 grade point ratio. His reason
for leaving is quite simple. “Met-
talurgical majors have trouble find-
ing courses to take here.”

Mike said that he had enjoyed his
stay and that his leaving was just
a question of completing his major.

Seeking Better Courses

John Rosenberg is a ZBT fresh-
man who plans to leave Washing-
ton and Lee at the end of this se-
mester. The desire to attend a larg-
er institution with a wider choice
of courses has prompted his decision.

John feels a sense of pride in the
Honor System and in “other tradi-
tions which are, unfortunately, pret-
ty much neglected.”

The opportunity to go to a large

 

school like Tulane and to be in a
big city like New Orleans has been
the prime factor in Lee Johnson, a
2.5 man, choosing to leave W&L.

“Anyone who has ever gone to
school in New Orleans will imme-
diately know why I’m leaving. Lex-
ington is so bad.”

Johnson was, like the others, im-
pressed with the Honor System.

In addition to freshmen transfer-
ring who have been quoted, there
are a number leaving who prefer
to make their remarys anonymously.
The following opinions are taken
from such students, all of whom
hold a grade average of 2.0 or better.

Simply Not That Difficult
I don’t see how this school could
possibly be ranked as one of the
top colleges in the country” com-
mented one freshman. “The school
is simply neither that good nor dif-
ficult.”

Another said that “even though
the faculty is generally distinguished
and their accomplishments should be
recognized, I don’t see them bring-
ing about a driving sense of intellec-

“

tual stimulation, or maybe what I
should call an electric atmosphere.”

A few students had remarks on
the present freshman curriculum.

Generals Battle For Ball With Tar Heels

Lacrosse Team To Face
Blue Devils Saturday

Washington and Lee’s goalie Ray Miller may prove to be
the deciding factor as the Generals come up against Duke this
Saturday in their 11th lacrosse match of the season.

The Generals, whose 1-9

record is almost identical to

 

Duke’s 1-8 record, will be counting* -

heavily on Miller and his 20 saves
per game average to keep the Blue
Devils out of the scoring column.
Miller who has an impressive tally
of over 200 saves in games this year,
has been selected as the South’s
goalie in June’s North-South Game.

With both teams going into Satur-
day’s fray carrying only one vic-
tory apiece, authorities have picked
it to be the closest lacrosse contest
of the weekend. Washington and
Lee managed to defeat Duke in ’59
and ’60 but gave up a close one
last year as the Blue Devils turned
in a 6-3 victory.

Duke, rated as a big, “hard-nosed”
team, will be on their toes this
weekend and shooting for another

victory to even the score for the
four game series. Little Jim Griffith,
5’5”, will be leading their attack as
their outstanding player. Rated as
one of the best attackmen to face
W&L this year, Griffin makes up for
his lack of size with brilliant stick-
work and speed. Outstanding de-
fenseman Mike Welsh will also be at
his best, aiming to give W&L’s Car-
roll Klingelhofer and Bob Hankey
a tough time around the Blue Devils’
goal.

Despite the fact that both teams
appear to be going into the game
fairly evenly matched the Generals
will have a definite advantage with
Miller in the goal since Duke’s goal-
ie has been rated as poor to fair.

 

NOTICE

Spring soccer practice will begin
this Monday. Practice will run 4:00
to 5:00 through Friday. All interested
should report to the fieldhouse
Monday at 4:00 to draw equipment.

Cross-Country Anticipates
Excellent Season In Fall

By ANDY KILPATRICK

This fall the cross-country team will battle Washington and
Lee’s 4.1 mile course with one of the best teams in recent years.
The team will be led over the hilly terrain (the course is con-
sidered one of the toughest anywhere) by returning senior co-

 

country champ of W&L, having won
every race he started on the W&L
course this year, and having estab-
lished a school record of 24 min. 20
sec. on the lengthened course.

Entire Team Returns

The entire team will be returning
in the fall, as there were no seniors
on this year’s squad, and to give
it further depth, Coach Miller will
make every effort to recruit distance
runner Charlie Head and track star
Skip Essex. If Coach Miller can
succeed in convincing these boys
that Telegraph Hill (an obstacle
which is the point of truth about
two miles out on the course) is not
as steep or as long as it really is,
the team could develop into a really
superior group, especially with the
aid of some good freshmen.

Other returning runners will be
Bruce MacDonald, Dillard Munford,
Dave Mosbaugh, Gene Friedburg,
Mark Gee, and Bob Farrar.

Season 7-2

The team this year marked up a
7-2 season by defeating Randolph-
Macon, Lynchburg, Fairmont State,
Richmond, and Dickinson, and ob-
tained forfeits from Pfeiffer, and
Hampden-Sydney. W&L lost only to
strong Bridgewater and F&M teams.

Richmond, Dickerson, and Hamp-
den-Sydney have been dropped from
the schedule for 1962, but Norfolk
William and Mary and Roanoke
have been added.

After the state meet in Lynchburg
there will be two road races which
will challenge even the stoutest of
of runners. These races are the
Lexington-Buena Vista road race
(which, as everyone knows, is six
miles), and the Blacksburg-Chris-
tianburg road race, a nine mile af-
fair for anyone interested in running
nine miles.

Generals Lose
Close Decision

To ’Macon

The Washington and Lee baseball
team came out on the short end of
another close decision Wednesday,
this time losing to Randolph-Macon
at Ashland. Hampered by errors,
the Generals yielded a 2-1 lead in the
last of the night, losing 3-2.

The team’s record now stands at
1-9.

The loss was especially tough for
Generals’ pitcher Phil Sharp who
turned in one of the best perform-
ances displayed by the Washington
and Lee pitching staff this year.
Sharp walked only one man and
struck out seven while giving up
seven hits.

Washington and Lee scored both
its runs in the second inning. Robin
Wood led off the inning by reaching
first on an error and was followed
by Jim Russ who hit a sharp single
op the middle. Ashley Allen hit into
a fielder’s choice leaving runners
first and third. Both runners then
scored on a long double by Bobby
Williams.

Besides Williams’ and Russ’ hits in
the second, Hobbs, Gilmore Martin.
and Allen each picked up singles.

The Generals bad luck plague
struck again in the ninth inning as
an error by Howie Martin allowed
the Yellowjackets to tie the count
at 2-2. The deciding run came across
with two out in the ninth as a
Randolph-Macon batter _ singled
home a runner from third.

Since Washington and Lee was the
guest team, the two-out blow spelled
a loss for the Generals without
another opportunity.

Delts Cop
I-M Title

The Delta Tau Delta, boasting a
grand total of 195 points in the spring
intramural tournaments has pulled
away from second place Phi Kap and
third place Phi Psi to capture the
championship.

Although it still has the finals
of the table tennis tournaments to
play against ZBT, its strong per-
formance in softball this season has
assured Delt the first place spot.

Beating both Kappa Sig and SAE
in softball tournament play Delt
walked away with the championship
leaving Kappa Sig in second place,
SAE in third and DU in fourth.

Tie, win or lose in the table ten-
nis playoffs, Delt still has clenched
the Intramural Championships as
neither the second or third place
teams have entered contestants in
either of the spring tournaments.

 

Tennis Team Downs U.Va.
In Rain-Soaked Match

The Washington and Lee tennis
team scored a major upset over the
University of Virginia this Tuesday,
winning by a score of 3-2. Because
of rain the match was not finished
although it counts as a victory, since
more than half of the matches were
played.

Captain John Baker ran into some
unusually stiff competition as he
dropped his number one singles,
6-0, 6-2, But freshman Randy Jones
played beautifully in turning back
his opponent in short order, 6-1, 6-4.

close ties which the social life helps
to create.

Returning to Mr. Walker’s letter,
his main argument seems to be that
only the faculty can make an ob-
jective decision in regard to the
fraternity situation. Perhaps an en-
tirely objective decision is not what
is needed here to restore the balance
which once existed. This balance
is what made W&L one of the finest
small colleges in the country—not
only as a place of learning from
books but as a university where
other important aspects of life may
be learned as well.

As to Mr. Walker's apparent dis-
illusionment at what he finds here
at W&L, I certainly hope he has
made the right objective in flying
the coop. In his search for a “saner,
more mature world,” I wish him all
good luck. I feel he is doing the
right thing indeed.

Very sincerely,

CHARLES F. MORGAN

Student Blasts Conformity

Dear Sir:

It seems to me that the sense of
values of the students at Wash-
ington and Lee are grossly out of
proportion. I say this on the basis
of the class elections of last Mon-
day night and the aftermath of
heated controversy.

On Monday night a certain fresh-
man did something in the nominat-
ing convention which he sincerely
felt would benefit his class, and
through it the entire University.
This action was widely denounced as
being “detrimental to party solidar-
ity,” and for it this individual has
since been the subject of severe
criticism from his friends as well as
various other individuals.

Political parties serve a purpose
(although at Washington and Lee it
is rather vague), but when their
well-being becomes more important
than that of the body of people

they seek to serve, they have de-

existence. Should political parties
at Washington and Lee be so pow-

ber to make a controversial state-

a storm of criticism not only upon

as well.

In my opinion this is not inherent
in the fraternity system itself, but |
it has resulted at Washington and |
Lee through the students failing to|
honor a fraternity member’s opin- |
ion as his own. There are two pos-
sible solutions: (1) the student body
must realize that some individuals
will not surrender their complete
identity to the fraternity and will on
occasion speak their convictions; c1
(2) the fraternities must all set up
censoring committees so that no
such heresy as was evidenced on
Monday night will happen in the
future.

Math Course a Joke

One student took exception with
the mathematics department. “The
math course for freshmen is a joke.
Who needs a lot of what they teach,
especially at a liberal arts institu-
tion? Wouldn't college

a liberal arts major?”

one student: “When tradilions such
as conventional dress are imposed by
fines, they cease to be traditions and
become merely prep school rules. No

goes to class without a coat and tie,
either. There is one big difference,
though—the University of Virginia
never heard of an assimilation com-
mittee. I believe this shows a basic
weakness in the Washington and Lee
system.”

As been mentioned
the above comments were made by
freshmen with above 2.0 averages.
Some took part in campus publica-
tions, various sports, Troubadours,
and other organizations within the
school. It is alarming and disheart-

| Private George Irwin, former
W&L professor writes, about this
action:

“One of the most terrifying things
we have to put up with is the Ger-
man aviators. One chased two of our
ambulances down a road the other
day shooting his machine gun at
them, but did not register a hit.”

Sergeant Forest Fletcher, W&L
track coach after the war, describes
one unpleasant spot, the village of
Serches, the unit went through in
late August.

The town was in a hollow and the
Germans kept dropping in gas
shells. Masks had to be worn all
the time, which made driving diffi-
cult, especially at night.

Following the Allied advance, the
unit pushed into Belgium in October.

The armistice was soon signed, but

Interview With Albee

(Continued from page 2)

As to the influence of his School
of dramatists on other media, Albee
was doubtful. He said the spirit of
the Absurd as it is now is essential-
ly and perhaps inevitably theatrical,
and he expressed the belief that
there was no indication of any sort
of profound influence of the Absurd
Theatre on movies or television.

Although he was most polite and
receptive to his interviewers, Mr.
Albee showed the greatest enthus-
iasm when he and Mr. Taylor from
time to time got off into discussions
of technical questions which were
beyond the scope of those of us who
were not intimately acquainted with
the Absurd Theatre.

W&L Receives Research Grant
For Development In Science

A grant of $30,000 to Washington
and Lee University from the Re-
search Corporation of New York
was announced today by President
Fred C. Cole.

Washington and Lee will use the
grant to strengthen its science pro-

sum is to be expended at the rate
of $15,000, annually over a two-year
period, he added.

entitled The Scotch-Irish: A
Social History. The volume is
scheduled for distribution be-
ginning May 26.

in thin book, Dr. Leyburn
traces the three principal chap-
ters of the progress of the Scotch-
Irish including their life in Scotland,
their removal to Northern Ireland
and their migrations to America. He
dispels much of what he terms the
“mythology” of the Scotch-Irish.

A member of the Washington and
Lee faculty since 1947, Dr. Leyburn
is the author of The Haitian People,
which, in 1942, won the Anisfield-

 

Wolf Award for the best book on
race relations in the preceding
year.

Dr. Leyburn came to Washing-

ton and Lee from Yale University
where he had taught for 20 years,
rising from instructor to professor
of sociology. He was Dean of the
University at Wushington and Lee
from 1947 until 1956, when he
resumed fulllime teaching.
Degrees
He holds A.B. and A.M.
economics from Trinity Collens
Duke University and A.M.
degree in economics from Princeton
University. He received his Ph.D.
degree in sociology from Yale in
1927, joining the faculty of that |
school the same year.

IFC DECIDES T0 ABOLISH HELL WEEK

Ross Kyger To Serve As

New [FC

By STEVE

President

GUILD

Managing Editor

In an hour-long meeting

last night the Interfraternity

Council abolished all forms of Hell Week or Help Week. The

action followed the defeat of th
been submitted to the IFC two

e proposed rush plan that had
weeks ago by the Rush Week

Study Committee. After the discussion of the rush plan Ross

Kyger was elected
of the IFC.

The proposed rush plan was be-
fore the IFC for the second week
in a row. Last week the plan re-
ceived the necessary two-thirds vote
for any change or amendment to the
IFC constitution. The vote for the
plan in last week’s meeting was 13-4 |
but in the ensuing week several
houses found weaknesses or changed
their minds about the plan and the |
final vote was 10-8.

Hell Week Abolished

As soon as the Rush proposal was
was defeated there was a motion to,
extract the portion of the proposal,
section A, which reads that all forms |
of Hell Week or Help Week shall be}
immediately abolished. The motion |
passed by a vote of 14-4. This means
for the fraternities that the first |
week in the second semester that has |
been traditionally reserved for con- |
centrated hazing of pledges will be
abolished. There are several details
in this that must still be worked
out, as was pointed out by several
members of the IFC. This will be
done the first of next year by either
the IFC or a special committee.

new president*

 

Reasons for Defeat

The principal reason for the de-
feat of the plan was not the general
outline of the plan but the specific
points that must be worked out in
the new system. Such things as open
house parties the first four to five
weeks, the handling of pledge ac-
tivities, and methods of controlling
dirty rush were mentioned as rea-
sons. Other houses feel there would
be a concentration of good pledges
in only a few houses under the new
proposals.

After the plan had been defeated,
George Honts, chairman of the Rush
Week Study Committee, proposed
that either the plan be put into effect
on a two-year trial basis, which
would still require the 2/3 vote or
recommend to the IFC that the
Committee continue their study next

spots in the plan.

The Council finally decided, after
a motion by Honts, that the IFC
feels that “the present plan is in-
complete in its present form and
recommends that a rush week study
will be continued in the fall under
the direction of a special commit-
tee.”

It was also suggested after this
motion passed unanimously that
the Faculty Committee on Fra-
ternities be notified of this action
and the reasons behind it by the
president of the IFC and members
of the Rush Week Committee.

Dean Atwood, advisor to the IFC,
emphasized that the Faculty Com-
mittee would look with favor upon
this action and the IFC’s willingness
to study the problem further, and

| would take no action on the Rush

Week situation as long as it was
being considered by the IFC.

New Officers

Following the discussion of the
rush plan, election of next year’s
officers was held. Ross Kyger, Kappa
Sig rising senior was elected presi-
dent over Bill Young, DU. Other
officers are Conway Shields, PiKA
rising junior, vice president; George
Craddock, Beta rising junior, sec-
retary; Bob Hart, SAE rising senior,
treasurer; IFC rush chairman, Tony
Schlesinger. ZBT rising senior; and
IFC rush book editor, Pete Alford,
Phi Psi rising junior.

Dean Atwood

Other business taken up by the
IFC was a statement by Dean At-
wood that a post script to a letter
by C. C. Gilmore (see page 2) to
all the fraternities at W&L said,
“Resist any change in the present
system. Take your case to Dr. Cole.”
Atwood wanted to make clear that
President Cole is neither for nor

idents will be able “to throw

It’s Up To The Individual

One must realize that the freshman courses of instruction
are necessarily basic and limited. One must secure a firm foun-

been filled with news of the

large number of freshmen that plan to leave Washington and
Lee at the end of the semester. Various causes have been listed

and numerous excuses offered.

A closer study of the problem will reveal that most of the
current rumors are false. It has been stated that “approximately
25 freshmen left W&L on their own accord at the end of the

first semester.”

However, official figures from the registrar and

the Dean of the College show a completely different picture.

Official figures obtained from the Registrar’s office show
only 16 freshmen present during the first semester that
were not in attendance at the beginning of the second semester.
Of these, 9 fell under the Automatic Rule, and three left dur-
ing the first semester. Thus only four freshmen withdrew vol-
untarily at the end of the first semester.

Furthermore, these figures

do not bear out the “‘rumor”’

that 30 or so will leave at the end of the semester. Only seven
freshmen have failed to register for next year. This is quite
a different picture from that which has been recently presented.

To those who have decided to leave and to those who are

thinking of leaving, there are a

few points that merit consider-

eration. First, a problem is never solved by running away.
Those who say that this school does not create an atmosphere
of intellectualism should stop to examine themselves and the

charges.

To the Editor:

In my letter last week I called
W&L a “post-graduate High School.”
This was a rather sweeping general-
ization, yet I feel that I can support
it with some specific, rational criti-
cisims, I admit that my letter was
emotional and generalized, but I did
this on purpose, in order to achieve
a shock effect. I feel that there is a
rather smug and complacent atti-
tude on this campus which needs to
be jolted into an awareness of cur-
rent problems.

In order to understand the basis
for my criticism, each student must
ask himself the following question:
“Why am I at college?”

I believe that a college exists for
one reason only—for the purpose
of educating its students. Hence,
the students have only one pur-
pose at College—to get an educa-
tion, and all other considerations
are secondary,

I do not believe that students are
pursuing this ideal. They seem to
be more interested in having a good
time than in getting an education.
I have noticed an appalling lack of
interest in the pursuit of knowledge.
Where have I noticed this? Allow
me to cite a few specific examples.

Uusually they are talking about last

ject. Never do you hear students dis-
cussing any matter of real signifi-
cance.

I have also found that very few
students here ever read a book just
for the hell of it, or for no other
reason than the fact that they heard
it was a good book and were curious
to read it. I feel that this is very im-

mary goals of education—to create well rounded individuals.

This can not be accomplished in
a proper mixture of work and

the class room alone. However,

Similarly, it has been stated that W&L is too small and
does not offer sufficient opportunities for intellectual develop-
ment. This is ridiculous. Let those who want to go to a large
university go. There they will become a number instead of a

name. They will also have unl

imited courses from which to

choose—courses in such intellectual fields as relaxation and

hotel management.
Those that claim that W&L

does not offer enough courses

prospective freshman receives a

the dinner table, and during most
of the student’s free time.

Now I do not feel that a student
should deny himself all forms of
relaxation. A date, a drink, a flick,
is all right just as long as it does
not become a way of life. However,
I feel that pleasure seeking has
become a way of life on this cam-
pus.

This brings up the whole question
of the use of free time. How does
the average W&L gentleman spend
his free time? Well, he probably
either goes to a flick, drinks a
couple of beers, goes down the road,
or indulges in some similar form of
pleasure-seeking. Rarely does he
utilize his free time to further his
education. I take an extreme posi-

Finals Dance In

Commons

Will End Seniors’ Year

By FRANK YOUNG

Washington and Lee’s 1962 Finals
Dance weekend will present a new
concept in Univer-
sity sponsored
functions. This
concept will take
the form of a Sen-
_ ior Ball to be held
' Thursday _ night,
June 7, from 10
to 12 in the Evans
_ Dining Hall.

The purpose of
the Senior Ball is
primarily to give
the graduating
seniors an opportunity to entertain
their parents in a somewhat more
sophisticated manner than the fra-
ternity combo parties might allow.
“ach June, hundreds of parents flock
to Lexington in hopes of sharing
their son’s last few college days with
him. In years past, the entertainment
of these parents has been relatively
neglected, with drab Lexington of-
fering little for their amusement.

 

Young :

To Follow Reception

This year’s Ball will be held the
night before graduation and will im-
mediately follow President Cole’s
Senior reception. The dance will
give the seniors and their parents a
further opportunity to mingle with
other parents and faculty members
who will attend.

Although the Graduation Ball is
primarily held in honor of the sen-
iors and their parents, underclass-
men are urged to attend. As the

dress for seniors at President Cole’s
reception will be formal, seniors at-
tending the dance must be formally
attired. Underclassmen and parents,
however, will be admitted to the
dance in semi-formal dress. The par-
ents and friends of graduating sen-
iors who own a Dance Plan will be
admitted to the Ball free of charge.

Decorations

Decorations for the Senior Ball
will be moderate, as the atmosphere
of the Dining Hall itself is sufficient
setting for a farewell dance. The
Dance figure will be held at 11
o'clock and will include the Presi-
dent of Finals Dances, Jack Varda-
man, his vice presidents, and the
officers of this year’s senior class.

Tables will be arranged on sides
of the Ball Room where spectators
may relax and view the festivities.
Punch will be served on the baleony
of the Dining Hall.

Finals Concert

The recent signing of Fats Domino
to play for the concert Tuesday night,
June 5, has apparently met with stu-
dent approval. Domino has long
been a favorite among rock and
roll adherents, and his performance
is reportedly a riotous one. He is
bringing his full rock and roll back-
up band to support him.

The Domino Concert coupled with
the Senior Ball and various frater-
nity parties should render this year’s
Finals Dances a successful one which
the graduating seniors and _ their

 

parents will long remember.

that everything is all right, and that
there is no room for improvement.
This is an unhealthy attitude for
any institution to take. Even the
best institutions should be constant-
ly striving to improve. If we are so
smug and complacent as to believe
that there is no room for criticism
or improvement then we have sealed
our own tragic fate.

Separate but Equal

I do not agree with the idea that
the academic and social aspects of
a college can exist “separate but
equal.” One, of necessity, will in-
trude upon the other. If we are to
be the leaders of tomorrow, then we
had better start preparing ourselves
today. I feel that we can best pre-
pare ourselves in the classrooms and
in the library rather than in the
Paramount or in a fraternity base-
ment.

As a result of the increased com-
petition for college admissions, we
are getting a higher caliber of stu-
dent every year. We must adapt to
meet the demands made by these
students. Obviously, a number of
highly qualified freshmen have found
W&L unsuitable for their needs and
are leaving. W&L can no longer af-
ford to cling to its way of life.

Those who advocate such a policy
are oblivious to the inexorable
changes that are taking place. I am |
appalled at the number of students |
here who would cling to the past.
That is why I encourage more strong
action on the part of the Administra-
tion. If the students cannot act in-
telligently, then the Administration
must act for them.

W&L could be the best college
in the nation. It could provide dy-
namic leadership for the South es-
pecially. But if this is to come about,
“there'll have to be some changes
made.”

By GEORGE HONTS

There a lot of things we will re-
member about our college careers
in the years to come. I for one
will not soon forget the first man I
met when I walked into the Fresh-
man Dormitory quadrangle for the
first time—a poorly prepared, scared
freshman. That man was Rupert N.
Latture.

Mr. Latture is retiring this June
after a 50-year association with
Washington and Lee University. I
spent the better part of a day
browsing around the hall talking to
his colleagues, men who have work-
ed with him for a number of years
and men who have known him for
only a relatively short time. Their
sentiments are best expressed in a
quote jotted down in Dr. Cole’s of-
fice. “He is a man,” the President
said, “who has been deeply devoted
to the University.”

Praise
Another colleague made this state-
ment about his services, “Prof. Lat-
ture’s 50 years at W&L have been
characterized by interest and faith.”

Most of us probably don’t real-
lize it, but Prof. Latture has serv-
ed a lengthy term on the faculty
administrative committee where he
has time after time “gone to bat”
for students who have gotten
themselves in trouble. His efferts
have saved several students’ aca-
demic lives, but like everything he
has done, this work was done in
a quiet, modest manner so no one
would ever know.

Prof. Latture came to Washington
and Lee University in 1912. He grad-
uated valedictorian of the class of
1915 after serving a term as vice
president of the Student Body and
being active in the YMCA, the fore-
runner of the present University

 

Christian Association.

 

dation upon which to build. This is true no matter where you

go. It is, therefore, unfair to

criticize our school on these

grounds before all of the facts are known.

Those who make these charges against our University have
only themselves to blame. One gets out of a school what one
puts into it. Here, there are virtually unlimited opportunities
for intellectual advancement. One only has to make effort on

his own to find them.

A Job Well Done

The election of Ross Kyger as president of the IFC closes
out a successful term of office for Bob Doenges, this year’s
president of the IFC. Doenges has directed the IFC through a

most trying and successful year.

Many of the pressing problems that face fraternities were
topics of debate. Under the able leadership of Doenges, many
of the problems were brought to a successful conclusion.

Last night his year in office was terminated by the passage of
a resolution that ended Hell Week. This motion was successful
largely because of the efforts of Doenges.

Bob Doenges deserves a vote of thanks from the entire
student body for his untiring efforts and devotion to W&L and

its fraternities.

Mr. Latture’ 5 Career Is Marked
By ODK And Modest Manner

On the 28th of August, 1917,
Prof. Latture married Roberta
Fulton. They have two children,
Mrs. George Woolfenden of Birm-
ingham, Ala., and William E. Lat-
ture of Oneonta, Ala.

Mr. Latture joined the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1920. He was
elevated to Associate Professor in
1925 and to full professor in 1941,
the same year he was named head
of the Political Science department.
During his first four years here, Mr.
Latture taught French—a language
he was well qualified to give in-
struction in, as we shall see.

French Army

During 1917-18 Mr. Latture was
assigned to the French Army in a
quasi-military capacity. He told me
the other night that when Gen.

 

 

 

Mr, Rupert N. Latture

 

Pershing reached Paris he found the
French morale extremely low and
German propaganda very intense.
Prof. Latture and one hundred other
French-speaking Americans were
attached to the French Army and
worked “in the danger zone” near
the front to educate the French on
what America was doing to help the
Allied cause and to boost the mor-
ale.

He operated near the front with-
out the benefit of a uniform—which
would mean that if he were cap-
tured he would be without the bene-
fits of normal Prisoners of War. Mr.
Latture’s services earned him a
Croix de France—the equivalent of
an American Decoration for Meri-
tous Service—in 1918. In 1918 Mr.
Latture enlisted in the American
Army in Paris and served with the
Allied Expenditary Forces through
1919.

42 Years

During the 42 years which Prof.
Latture has lived in Lexington and
W&L he has quietly taken part in
many civic and University projects.
He has for years been responsible
for the freshman assembly program
which helps assimilate freshmen into
the university by a series of meetings
every September. He served as Sup-
erintendent of the Presbyterian Sun-
day School for years and is an Elder
in the Church. Since 1918 he has
held a position on the Rockbridge
County Welfare Board, and after
World War II he served on NLRB
arbitration boards.

While his retirement will prob-
ably mean that Mr. Latture will
not teach any classes next year—
undoubtedly sad news to a number
of students since several of his
classes have been SRO this year—
he will still be active in an ad-
ministrative capacity. The details

For a couple of weeks now I’ve
been keeping my ear to the ground
in order to hear some of the rum-
blings that have been reported to be
coming from the freshmen. In four
years here I’ve noticed that fresh-
men rumble quite a bit, especially
just before lunch-time, but I’ve al-
ways taken it for granted that it was
just because they skipped breakfast.
At least when I was a freshman
that’s what caused most of my rum-
blings.

But currently the rumblings have
taken on a different tone—that of

him into a deep conversation about
the causes for the rumored exodus.
I said:

T. C.: What's all this jazz you
guys are spreading around about
leaving school in June. I under-

stand you don’t approve of the gen-
eral situation around here, Is that
right?

Freshman: Well, it’s actually not
that simple. I mean, we're leaving,
but it’s hard to say why. I mean,
once you start to think about it
there is such a complex of forces
and motives at work here that it’s
really rather hard to say, flatly, ex-
actly why we’re leaving.

TC: Well, why don’t you give it
a whirl anyway! You know, start
talking and maybe something will
come out. What don’t you like about
W&L?

FR:

I was tricked into coming here,

in the first place, I mean, like I
wanted to go to Princeton but I
wasn’t accepted. So I really had no

choice. From the first, then, you can

see, I was deprived of my free will,

To W&M By 5-3

By AL JOHNSTON

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team lost to Norfolk Division of Wil-
liam and Mary by a score of 5-3
here yesterday.

It was the Generals’ final game
of the season. The team has thus
compiled a record of one win, twelve
losses and one tie.

William and Mary’s John Wal-
ton pitched the entire nine innings,
striking out five, walking three and
allowing eight W&L hits.

Phil Sharp started for the Gen-
erals but was relieved after 2 1/3
innings by Mason McGowin.

McGowin was taken out at the
end of the fifth and replaced by a
freshman left-hander, Chris Wigert.
He took the mound until the ninth
inning and was then relieved by
another freshman, Lou Paterno who
pitched the final two outs of the
season. Together, they allowed six
W&M hits but four of their five
runs were unearned.

 

Don Parks and John Zadell were
the leading hitters for W&M with
two apiece. W&L’s Chuck Lane |
and Ashley Allen both were two
for four to lead the Generals at |
the plate.

flied out ending the inning.

6-2; W&L Suffers
Eleventh Defeat

By C. C. HARDWICK
The Generals were defeated, 6-2,
by the Hampden-Sydney Tigers last
Saturday in Death Valley.

The first W&L run was scored
by Park Gilmore in the first in-
ning. After hitting a triple, Gil-
more was driven in on a sacrifice
fiy ball hit by Russ.

In the six inning, Ned Hobbs, on
with a single, stole second and then
scored the second run when Louis
Flanagan singled.

The Generals had five
against eight for the Tigers.

Hampden-Sidney was led to vic-
tory by Art Matney’s pitching and
Will Lowry’s well-placed hitting.

After leading off with a single,
Lowry scored the first run, and then
in the eighth connected with a two-
run triple to close out the Tigers’
scoring.

hits

as

Hampden-Sydney also scored
two runs in the fourth on three
consecutive singles followed by
a sacrifice fiy and another single
by Garnet Davis.

Matney drove in the other run on
a single in the eighth.

Brice Gamber started on the
mound for the Generals, but was re-
lieved by Louis Paterno in the
eighth. This was the longest period
that Gamber had played in a game
this season. Coach Lyles said that
this would be good experience for
Gamber, who although he has been
pitching a little wild this season,
will be an excellent prospect for
next year.

In general, Lyles said that the
team play “wasn’t bad” and empha-
sized that the score was 4-2 until

 

 

the eighth when the Tigers got two

hits off Paterno.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Debate Team
Defeats W-F

The Washington and Lee debate
team capped off a highly successful
season by capturing the Television
Debate Championship of North Car-
olina from Wake Forest last night.

The three-man W&L team of Al
Eckes, Bill Noell and Bill Boardman
won their third straight match with
a unanimous decision victory over
the Deacons.

W&L was the only school to
emerge undefeated from the meets
which were held during the past
three months.

In addition to this television cham-
pionship, the team also won the
Virginia State Championship earlier
in the year. Included in their other
activities this year have been 14
tournaments, six television shows, a
discussion conference and_ several
demonstrations debates.

 

Executive Committee Has
Light Business Session

In a short business meeting last
night, the Executive Committee fin-
alized plans to meet freshmen in
the dorm next week to discuss the
Honor System.

EC members will hold meetings
throughout the dorm at 10 p.m. next
Tuesday.

Their aim is to clarify any mis-
conceptions or misgivings about the
system that may have arisen re-
cently in the freshman class.

Arrangements were also made last
night for an informal solicitation of
votes among seniors to secure pas-
sage of the EC’s recently proposed
constitution. As a result of last
week’s election only slightly more
than 30 votes are needed to push
the measure through.

Votes will be solicited informally
at the Senior _banquet tonight.

Stickmen Lose Last Game

Duke’s Buckalaw threw in the final
goal of the day to cinch the win.

Good individual play by Duke’s
midfielder Griffith, who accounted
for three Duke goals, and tight de-
fensive work by Mike Welsh, saved
the day for the Blue Devils.

Virginia

The Generals’ final game of the
season this Saturday against the
University of Virginia is expected to
be a tough one. The Wahoos are
rated among the top ten teams in the
nation and have beaten the same
Baltimore U. team which the Gen-
erals lost to last week, 19-6.

President Cole commended the Re-

what he called “the necessity of en-

close scholar-student relationship at
the undergraduate level.”

Dr. Robert D. Whitaker, 29-year-

out yet according to President
Cole, but he emphasized that “Mr.
Latture’s long years of service are
invaluable and we are very pleased
he has expressed a desire to help
in these areas of interest to him
and importance to the University.”

Besides his fine record at W&L,
Mr. Latture has another monument
to a very successful career,. He was,
as I am sure we are all aware, one
of the founders of Omicron Delta

with chapters on over 100 campuses.

Gilmore Hits Rush Plan

(Continued from page 2)

(2) It will not be the end of fac-
ulty attack on fraternities even if the
faculty now accepts it.

It will keep the student body in
a continual “RUSH WEEK” for 4-5
weeks instead of one, and the fresh-
men will not know appreciably more
about all fraternities in 4-5 weeks
than in one.

It will probably mean fewer fresh-
men will ever join a fraternity, and
it will probably mean that the
5 or 6 best fraternities will come
out best and the rest of your 12-13
houses will gradually weaken.

The faculty, in a few years, will
say that too much interference in
classes has resulted from this ex-
tended “RUSH WEEK,” and sopho-
more year rushing-pledging-initia-
will be a 100% certainty.

Our established rush week coming
before school opens is the BEST for
W&L. DO NOT LET FACULTY
PRESSURE CONVINCE YOU
OTHERWISE! Any change now will
be a mistake for the fraternity or-
ganization in general and for 12-13
houses specifically.

like that.

TC: I see your point. Please con-
tinue.

FR: Another thing around here is
intellectual apathy. I mean, all peo-
ple talk about is sex and _ liquor,
and nobody knows anything else.
Mind you, I’m not condemning the
school for this—it’s the students’ re-
sponsibility. Just imagine how many
people went to hear Sen. Albee
speak the other night—not more than
100—10% of the student body! And

I bet that hot playwright, uh,
what’s-his-name?

TC: Tower?

FR: Yeah, Tower. I bet he’s not

getting his message across to the
bunch of lunk-heads around here.

TC: Did you see the plays?

FR: No, I don’t go in for that
avant-garde stuff at all, I’ve never
seen any of that junk. It’s for the
birds. And Ill tell you why I think
so, too. My Father, he’s from Alaba
ma, he says...

TC: Never mind, let’s get back to
all you freshmen leaving school.
What do you like about W&L?

FR: Oh, most everything, I guess.
I mean, like I tell the guys back
home. This is really a great place
when you get right down to it.

 

TC: Oh, well, then how many of
you guys are leaving? I understand
the rumor’s about thirty.

FR: Oh, at least. Probably more.
I know one guy for sure. He’s in
my dorm section. I don’t know his
name, but know for sure he’s leav-
ing. And I'll bet there are a lot
more too.

TC: Yes, I imagine so. They’re, I
mean, you're all leaving for a “san-
er, more mature world,” is that it?

FR: Yeah, that’s it. “Saner, more
mature world,” that’s the words
I've been looking for. I mean, has a
nice ring, doesn’t it? Sort of like a
slogan. Yeah, that’s what we’re going
to do all right. We’re going to get
out of here and start thinking. Like
getting out of high school again.
Into a different millennium.

TC: Milieu?

FR: Oh yeah, milieu. What are you
going to do?

Generals Fall To Norfolk

(Continued from page 3)

When asked the reason for the
baseball team’s losing season, Coach

too many errors, weak catching and
the lack of hits when they were
needed.

TILL WE MEET AGAIN

This is the final column of my eighth year of writing for the
makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and this year, as in every pre-
ceding year, when I come to the last column of the season, I

come to a problem.

My contract with the makers of Marlboro calls for me to
write a humor column and, truly, I do the best I can—all things
considered, I am not, I should explain, a jolly man by nature.

Why should T be?

in television.

First of all, I am shorter than everybody.
Second, there are moths in my

‘ashmere jacket. Third, I work

All the same, when it comes time to write this column, I light
a good Marlboro Cigarette, put aside my trauma, and try with
all the strength in my tiny body to make some jokes. Some-
times it works better than others, but on the last column of the
year, it just flatly doesn’t work at all.

Even in the very beginning this was true—and that, you will re-
call, was eight years ago when I was relatively young and strong
and had not yet developed that nasty knock in my transmission.
Well do I remember sitting down to write the final column of my

first year.

Day followed barren day, and not a yoek, not a boff,

not a zinger did I produce. I was about to give up humor and
take a job selling mechanical dogs when all of a sudden, in a

blinding flash,

I realized why I couldn’t think of any jokes!

I leapt up from my typewriter and ran as fast as my little
fat legs would carry me to the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes,
and I tugged my forelock, and I said, “Sirs, I am well aware
that you have engaged me to write a humor column, but today,
as I approach the final column of the season, I am far too misty
to be funny, for the final column of the season is, after all, a
leave-taking, and when I think of saying goodbye to my audience
—the swellest audience any columnist ever had—the college
students of America—wonderful human beings, every man and

wise but kindly —astute but compassionate—
when, sirs, I think of saying good-

bye to such an audience, I am too shook up even to consider
levity, and so I ask you, sirs, to let me, in the final column of the

year,
straightforward farewell.”

forego humor and instead write a simple, dignified,

Then I took out my bandanna, wiped my eyes, ears, nose, and

throat and waited for a reply

IFC Undergoes Changes, Acquires Power

By ROGER PAINE
Friday Managing Editor

The election of Ross Kyger as
next year’s president of the Inter-
fraternity Council marks one of the
steps that have been made in the
past year by the IFC to prove that
it is a maturing student organiza-
tion. Kyger’s election came despite
the fact that the University Party
candidate is usually elected year
after year by the 10-8 majority that
the Big Clique holds.

It is obvious that fraternities are
thinking more about the responsi-
bility that the IFC should have, once
did have, and will have once again if
if it can show itself worthy of pos-
sessing that responsibility. At one
time the IFC held complete control
over student social affairs. The fac-
ulty kept out of everything, hoping
that the students on the IFC would
meet all the needs that arose.

 

Since that year’s IFC did not use
its power, and because this trend was
continued in following years, the
faculty removed all power from the
IFC and took most of the control of
student social affairs into its own
hands. The result was the banish-
ment of combos on Sunday, the re-
stricting of the hours of combos to
2 am., and the demand that girls be
out of fraternity houses at 3 a.m.

This year the IFC is once again
trying to assert itself. The task at
hand is to regain the contidence of
the faculty, and then maintain the
IFC as a mature and responsible
student organization. The IFC hopes
to show positive action, and not
merely reaction, in all future moves.

One of the big problem areas for
the IFC is communication with the
faculty. Students must work through
the Faculty Committee on Fraterni-
ties in all things they do in order
to make any impression on the facul-

NEWS BRIEFS

 

Student Control Committee
Will Be Enlarged Next Year

A plan for increasing the size of the Student Control Committee will be
submitted to the administration Monday. The Executive Committee is
asking for two additional members, who will be chosen at large.

This plan has been devised in favor of an alternate increase of one
representative from the junior class and another at large. President-elect
Tim Ireland hinted that the Student Control Committee may become
even more powerful next year.

 

WEL Receives $30,000 Grant

A grant of $30,000 to W&L from the Research Corporation of New York
was announced Tuesday by President Cole. The grant will be used to
strengthen the science program through the addition of professors, Presi-
dent Cole said.

The sum will be expended at the rate of $15,000 annually over a two-
year period, President Cole added.

Science Departments Attend Convention in Norfolk

Thirteen students and six faculty members represented Washington and
Lee at a meeting of the Virginia Academy of Science in Norfolk May 9-12.

Attending from the department of psychology were Donald Stubbs,
Wally Thulin, Clarence Whitehead, John Harcourt, Milford Schwartz, Dr.
William Hinton, and Dr. Leonard Jarrard.

From the chemistry department were Robert Auburn, Edward Eadie,
George Fozzard, John Ambrose, C. W. Hickam, Kerford Merchant, Henry
Hawthorne, Bruce Houghton, Dr. John Wise, Dr. Robert Whitaker and
Dr. Keith Shillington.

Dr. Edward Turner represented the physics department.

 

Debate Team Elects Officers For Next Year

Al Eckes and Jay Clark were elected co-captains of the debate team
for next year in a meeting last night. Ed Norton was elected manager, and
Steve Smith publicity chairman. Bill Boardman is the retiring captain.

 

Course To Be Built Around New Computer

A non-credit one-hour course in computer programming and machine
operation will be offered next semester by Baine Fox, director of the office
of statistical records. The course will involve one afternoon class section
per week.

Fox said a maximum of three sections can be handled, with a maximum
of 15 students per section. No prerequisite is required for the course, and it
is open to all students on a first come basis.

Crenshaw Elected President Of Revived AAUP

The Washington and Lee chapter of the American Association of
University Professors, disbanded during the 1930's, was reactivated last
night and Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw was elected president of the chapter.

A constitution was adopted and other officers chosen as follows: vice
president, Dr. Milton Colvin; secretary-treasurer, Dr. James Patty. The
AAUP has a membership of 47,000 professors and has chapters on 670
campuses. Founded in 1915, its primary function has been to defend the
principle of academic freedom.

The IFC has gotien sick, however
of hearing third-hand what the fac-

conversely, the faculty is often un-

the IFC will be brought into effect

Many notable accomplishments can
be attributed to the IFC this year.

will be strictly enforced next year,
beyond the penalty of a mere fine.

put teeth into all the resolutions
which it passes.

Several fraternities are bitterly
opposed to the Hell Week change,
but most houses accept the change
as inevitable and as ultimately best
for the school. It is felt that effec-
tive pledge-training programs can
be planned throughout the semester
so that the need that has been felt
in the past for a Hell Week will no
longer be present.

The IFC also has worked dili-
gently all year long on the Rush
Week proposal, which failed to win
the necessary two-thirds majority
by one vote that would have passed
it and made it a part of the W&L
life. The plan will be modified and
presented to the IFC again next
year. It is felt that the plan was
voted down by some fraternities be-
cause it has not yet been perfected.
Several members of the faculty are
greatly in favor of this plan and

think it is the best possible thing
for W&L.

One of the IFC’s pet peeves this
year has ben the constant accusa-
tion that its moves are made only
because unles it does act, the facul-
ty will cram something down the
students’ throats. This has been an
often said statement in regard to
the Rush proposal. The fact is that
the IFC was asked by the faculty to
study our rush system and those of
other schools and decide if there
might be a better one for this school.
The faculty would have been willing
to continue with the system as it
stands if the IFC had decided that
our present way of doing things
truly is the best.

The committee on the IFC which
was chosen to study this problem de-
cided, quite honestly, that a change
was needed, and the system they
have proposed has won the praise
and support of the administration

 

and much of the faculty. There was,
however, no ultimatum delivered by
the faculty stating that a change be
made or else.

The IFC is trying to come up with
original ideas for improvements at
W&L before the faculty feels it is
necessary to step in and apply pres-
sure for such improvements. One
idea that is in the pot at the present
time is to cut down fraternity ex-
penses in all fields as much as pos-
sible. A concrete suggestion is that
all fraternities cooperate next Rush
Week and purchase only keg beer.
This would save hundreds of dollars
all told, and would certainly be a
step in the direction of economizing
on fraternity outlay.

There has also been talk of plac-
ing a ceiling on the prices of com-
bos that are hired by fraternities
for dance weekends.

And so, the IFC is moving once

Publications Board Amendment Passes;

Both To Take Effect In Next Elections

secretary Steve Suttle announced yesterday.

Hairy Seeks
Serene Climes

The Finals Issue of The Southern
Collegian will be available near
the first of June. It will be “Mr.
Hairy’s” Goodbye Issue, due to the
fact that Hairy has had so many
rocks thrown at him this year by
so many people that he developed
a severe persecution complex and
has decided to withdraw from the
W&L student body. He hopes to
find a more serene and intellectual
atmosphere at the school to which he
has transferred—the University of
North Carolina.

At any rate, Hairy promises not to
leave W&L without a bang. There
will be the usual girls and the usual
jokes and the usual cartoons. In
fact, the issue might be fairly usual.
The staff has massed its forces this
issue, however, for a little satire di-
rected at some of the learning pro-
cesses of the school (all of this done
in perfectly good taste, of course)
and the 1962 All-Star Party Team
will be announced.

In the Finals Issue there will also
be a certain amount of honking of
the horn of self as the staff proudly
presents itself. A picture story by
Photographer Editor Dennis Brack
will be run which is entitled “Sun-
day.” There will also be a number
of ribald classics mixed with the
ads and all the rest of the usual
tripe.

Ask any VMI Cadet what May
14, 1864 means to him and he’ll tell
you that it was on that day 241
cadets won fame and honor for the
Institute on the Battlefields of New
Market.

Naturally, this is one of the Instit-
tute’s most cherished traditions, and
to six cadets there today it is even
more cherished. These six are des-
cendents of New Market Cadets.

Brifly, the story behind the New
Market campaign is: The nothern
forces under General Stegel were
moving down the Valley meeting
little opposition they marched.
The Southern forces were weakened
and in need of reserves but regard-
less of their condition they had to
meet and halt Stegel’s army. It was
at this point some Confederate of-
ficial struck upon the idea of using
the VMI cadets to back the Southern
forces up.

A message was sent to Colonel
Scott Shipp—the Institute’s 24-year-
old Commandant—and he set out
with the majority of the corps for
the three day march to New Market.

as

 

 

favor of a petition-nomination plan
and the elimination of three of the
four dance presidents are the two
major changes in the constitution.
The Publications Board amendment
provides for the replacement of the
Publications Board’s member on the
EC by a second junior class rep-
resentative.

Une. the new constitution tne
nominating convention has _ been
abolished. Instead, any student pre-
senting a petition with 150 or more
signatures and a statement of the
office for which he is running will
be placed on the ballot.

Within a week after the deadline
for qualification there will be a vol-
iuntary student body assembly at
which the candidates for the otiices
of president, vice president and sec-
retary of the student body will
have a chance to present their views.
These changes will go into effect
in next year’s elections.

The second major change from
the old constitution is the elimination
of the offices of presidents of Springs,
Openings, and Finals. Their duties
will be assumed by the three class

presidents. The sophomore class
president will be in charge of
Springs, the junior president in

charge of Openings, and the senior
president in charge of Finals.

The other class officers wilt assisi
their respective presidents in the
dance preparations as well as any-
one else that he might appoint.

The only other changes are re-
wording and rearrangement of sev-
eral sections and the deletement of
the article pertaining to the selec-
tion of cheerleaders.

VMI Cadets Observe New Market Battle Anniversary

It was the ecadet’s spirit and en-
thusiasm that won the victory at
New Market. Late in the afternoon
of the battle the Southern forces
found themselves pinned down by
the Union guns. They could neither
advance nor retreat. It was at this
point that the Cadets came up out
of their trenches and began to
charge. A charge that caught the
northern forces off guard—both be-
cause of its suddeness and because
of the age of the people effecting
it (the average age of the cadets
was 18) and encouraged the South-
ern troops of General Breckenridge
to follow the charge.

Ten cadets were lost in the bat-
tle—six of them have been re-
turned to the VMI Post where they
are buried today.

The celebration of this historical
event is an annual affair at VMI, and
is covered by newspapers all over
the nation. To our neighboring in-
stitution, New Market Day is as hal-
lowed a tradition as Founders’ Day
is on this campus.

An IFC Problem

As Roger Paine points out today in his page one article, the
IFC seems to have been hampered in the past year by inade-
quate ,communications with the faculty. Apparently, no one
really seems to know the specific nature of many of the faculty’s
complaints about the fraternity system. And, likewise, the IFC,
and the student body as a whole, has no consistent means by
which it can air its problems to the faculty. The result in the last
year seems to have been a rather reactionary all-or-nothing at-
titude by both sides, especially by fraternities.

We are sure that both the faculty and the IFC are sympa-
thetic to each other’s problems, and that, whenever possible,
each would like to find a workable compromise in a specific area
of dispute. But compromises are difficult to reach when
legislation is based on haphazard second-hand information.

This problem would perhaps be most effectively solved
if the more interested members of the faculty and the student
body would take it upon themselves to create an informal dis-
cussion group, one which would be designed to foster informed
conversation and off-the-record opinions. A group such as this,
unimpeded by an “official” capacity, could do much to promote
responsible and thoughtful student government at Washington

and Lee.

Our Apologies

The editors of the Friday Ring-tum Phi apologize for their
statement in last week’s paper that “25 freshmen left on their
on accord at the end of the first semester.” In the original copy,
the number was ‘‘5,” and the mistake was purely typographical.
For an unfortunate occurrence such as this, the editors accept

full responsibility.

The “freshman problem” has perhaps been exaggerated,
but we still maintain that the freshman year’s academic work
could be more interesting and more stimulating. Extension of
the advanced placement program which is to begin next
year in the history department will help. But the faculty pro-
gram of freshman counselling, as we pointed out last week, is
still woefully inadequate. And the dorm counselors are a poor
substitute for the upperclass friendships that were a part of
fraternity membership before the advent of the dining hall.

The assimilation of freshmen into the University, in the
broad sense of the word, is a very big and a very bad problem
at present. We are less worried about the minority who want
to leave than we are about the very real reasons that many of
our freshmen have to be dissatisfied with their first year at

We&L.

 

Sanity at UNC: ‘Hot Nuts’ |)

Dear Sir:

There has been much said in re- |‘

cent issues of the R-t P about the

supposed mass exodus of many of| ™

this year’s freshman class because
of a desire to (1) be in a more
urbane environment, (2) matriculate
in a more intellectual climate, (3)
escape the vices of a rigorous social
life. However, we the undersigned
of next year’s rising senior class
feel that W&L provides all the in-
tellectual stimulation necessary for
a sound liberal arts education; that
Lexington does, after all, offer ade-
quate recreational facilities in the
form of three pool halls, five pubs,
one bowling alley, two flicks, and
more than adequate taxi service;
and that the social life strikes a hap-
py medium.

Nevertheless we are transferring
to the University of North Carolina
next year so that once again we may
enter that “sane world” wherein
we may derive the benefits of hear-
ing that grand old man of the South,
Martin Luther King, and enjoy the
solemnity and aethetic quality of
the ballads and spirituals of the
“Hot Nuts.”

To the Editor:

It seems from the correspondence
and articles which have appeared in
The Ring-tum Phi recently that an
exodus to greener academic pastures
is developing, apparently led by the
Bearded Prophet who is fast be-
coming Lexington’s answer to Moses.
With the protests being registered
by withdrawing freshman Sam
Walker, it would seem that it is time
for a look at what W&L is supposed
to do.

Possibly Mr. Walker, Mr. Slater,
and the many freshmen have been
mistaken in their beliefs about what
college should accomplish. According
to Mr. Walker, “a college exists for
one purpose only—for the purpose of
educating its students.” Of course,
this is right as far as it goes. How-
ever, there are other things to col-
lege than sitting in classrooms or
the library, and they are those very
things which Walker is against—the

Students At Conference Discuss
U.S.-Latin American Diplomacy

By JIM STARKEY

On May 2 more than 140 students
from over 60 of the leading colleges
and universities in the East gathered
at Aannapolis, Maryland, to take
part in the second annual Naval
Academy Foreign Affairs Confer-
ence.

Here, during this four-day con-
ference, the various aspects and
problems of United States foreign
policy in Latin America were exam-
ined in the light of the political,
social, and economic conditions of
Latin America.

The major purpose of the confer-
ence was to provide an opportunity
for a beneficial exchange of ideas on
the conference subject by “outstand-
ing college students, selected for
their interest in the field of interna-
tional relations.” After examining
the policies of the United States in
order to ascertain whether they were
consistent with the kind of Latin
America that is best for the world as
a whole, the conferees were to make
recommendations with regard to
what the policies of the United
States should be in Latin America.

Round-Table Groups

On the first day the conferences on
the basis of special interests, were
assigned to one of eight roun-table
discussion groups. Each group was
then cencerned with a specific area
in Latin America. The round tables
were moderated by prominent lead-
ers from the business, academic, and

 

political world, who were experts
in Latin American affairs.

Round-table Eight, of which I was
a member, concentrated primarily
on Brazil. Among the aspects of this
country discussed were: the poten-
tial of Brazil as a world power;
Soviet versus United States aims
in Brazil; Brazil’s attitude towards
the Organization of American States,
Pan-Americanism, the Latin Amer-
ican Common Market; and the value
and effect of U.S. military and eco-
nomic aid to Brazil.

After careful consideration of each
of these areas, the round table re-
solved that in view of the prob-
lems deriving from Brazil’s recent
emergence as a world power, and
out of our desire to foster the con-
tinuance of the domestic institutions
which have characterized the Bra-
zilian government since its inception,
the policy of the United States
should be based on the objectives
of developing a strong, independent,
economically sound Brazil, and fost-
ering amicable relations between the
United States and Brazil.

With respect to specific areas,
the group recommended that the
United States continue its economic
support of both governmental and
private sectors in an effort to accel-
erate the development of the Bra-
zilian economy.

Aid to Education

It was also proposed that the
United States, on the request of the
Brazilian government, should pro-
vide all possible assistance to the

development of the educational sys-
tem, and that the cultural exchange
program be expanded in both di-
rections in order to establish closer
cultural ties between the two peo-
ples.

In addition to the round-table dis-
cussions, five plenary sessions were
held during the course of the con-
ference, featuring speeches by major
public figures.

Among this group of distinguished
speakers were: the Honorable deLes-
seps S. Morrison, U.S. Ambassador
to the Organization of American
States, Senator John G. Tower, Re-
publican from Texas, the Honorable
Philip H. Coombs, Assistant Secre-
tary of the State for Cultural and
Educational Affairs, Rear Admiral
A. F. Schade, U.S. Navy Director of
the Politico-Military Division Of-
fice of the Chief of Naval Operations,
and Mr. Harry A. Jarvis, President
of Creole Petroleum Corporation of
Venezuela.

The conference closed on Satur-
day, May 5, with the discussion and
adoption of the resolutions formu-
lated by the eight round tables.
The conference, in my estimation,
was an overwhelming success, and I
consider having had the opportunity
of being a part of it, one of the most
valuable and rewarding experiences
of any college career.

(Editor’s note: Starky, along with
Ring-tum Phi Columnist Howard
Slater, represented Washington and
Lee at the foreign affairs confer-

 

ence held at the Naval Academy.)

ac

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Washington and Lee’s intercol-
legiate debate team has for the past
couple of years met with phenomen-
al success. In addition to participat-
ing in six television shows, 14 tour-
naments, and demonstrating before
civic and high school groups this
year alone, they have turned down
invitations to Miami, the Mardi
Gras, Hawaii and Harvard, among
others.

What’s behind this remarkable
record? According to Professor Wil-
liam Chaffin, head of the debate
team, the essence of good debate is
a “combination of research, presen-
tation and analysis.”

In the fall, Professor Chaffin holds
practice debates. Assisted by his top
team members, he criticises and
offers suggestions for improvements
to those who are participating.

Interest and Ability

The prime prerequisites for de-
bating here, according to Chaffin,
are interest and ability. He said that
“it is immaterial how little exper-
ience a person has had. Time, the
will to learn, and ability are the
chief factors involved. Anyone who
really has the desire and who puts
forth can debate at W&L.”

Pre-college training evidently is
is not so important. The first time
Chaffin took a winning team to the
state tournament, he took four
men—three freshmen and a sopho-
more. Bill Boardman, now one of the
top three debaters for the Generals,
had never seen an _ intercollegiate
debate, until, with only three weeks
experience, he won one.

There aren’t any sort of training
rules or hard-and-fast regulations
for the forensic champs. “We might

 

hold a practice debate at 19 am.,
2 p.m. or 10 p.m.”

Eckes, Noell, and Boardman

Twenty-odd students have par-
ticipated in debate this year, with
the top three being Al Eckes, Bill
Noell, and Bill Boardman. Chaffin
has made frequent use of Malcolm
Morris, Steve Smith, and Ed Nor-
ton as well.

However, “no single person has
taken part in even half of the de-
bate events this year,” Chaitin said.
“If I'm going to meet a weak var-
sity from another school, there’s no
point in taking Eckes or Noell.
Everyone who spends time on it
can get a chance to go to a tourna-
ment.”

Debate is the longest continuous
activity—athletic or otherwise—at
W&L. It starts in September and
goes through May. This year, there
have been 26 events so far, with
a program at VMI Scheduled soon.
“Of these events, we have won
more than we have lost,’ Chaffin
said. “But to try to arrive at a
numerical average is meaningless,
because of the fact that different
debaters are in competition all the
time. Most of our defeats have come
from novices who have never debat-
ed before. It doesn’t really matter,
though. Winning isn’t the purpose—
giving as many people as possible
experience in debate is.”

Tremendous Research Man

Commenting on his top men, Mr.
Chaffiin lauded Eckes as a “tremen-
dous research man.” Eckes and
Noell, both high school champion de-
baters, are the number one and two
debaters, depending on the circum-
stances. “While Noell has wen the
top awards, Eckes has won more
awards than have been won in re-

fln said.

‘Nothing More Pitiful’

Leaving the debate team itself,
he commented on the value of col-
lege speaking experience. “Anybody
is a fool if they don’t get some
speaking training in college. Noth-
ing is more pitiful than someone
who has something to say and can’t
say it.”

Debate requires as much or as
little time as you want to put into
it, Chaffin said, and noted several
persons who had participaied only
occasionally, due to other commit-
ments. “In adidtion to the 20-odd
that have participated on the de-
bate team, another 20 or so have
been involved this year in debate
discussions,” he added.

One of the side benefits seems
to be the travel experience. At
various times, the W&L debate
team has toured Gettysburgh, seen
the Philharmonic Orchestra perform,
taken in Broadway plays, and “tound
other means of amusement on
trips,” Chaffin said wryly.

He talked enthusiastically about
the value of speech training, the ac-
tivities of the debate team, and
spoke proudly of the accomplish-
ments of the debaters in recent
contests. We do have a high quality
forensic group here, and this re-
porter couldn’t help feeling this is
due in a large part to Professor
Chaffin. He’s a man who knows de-
bate and loves it, and he showed
this when he closed his remarks
with the comment: “The magic word
in debate is rapport. You must have
that rapport—that special feeling
between the debaters and the au-
dience.”

 

Dr. Hughes Studies ‘Man-Created World’

 

By BILL ATWELL

Next year Associate Professor of
History Thomas P. Hughes will be
on leave of absence from Washing-
ton and Lee. This leave of absence
will enable Dr. Hughes “to culti-
vate a new area of history—the his-
tory of technology and society.”

When asked what the history of
technology basically is, Dr. Hughes
replied “that the field is the study
of the man-created world and of man
as the creator. We know a great
deal concerning artists, politicians,
ets., but we actually don’t really
know what made a great inventor
such as Thomas Edison tick. We want
to find out.”

Historians and Scientists

As technological research has be-
come more and more important, Dr.
Hughes feels, as do a great many
others including British historian
C. B. Snow, that it is necessary for
the historian and scientist to get
closer together. Dr. Hughes believes
the scientist and engineer have defi-
nite creative traits, but says, “un-

fortunately a misapplication of these
traits can result in the terrible
growth of an institutior such as
Nazi Germany. If we car find out
where man goes astray, the world
will profit by this knowledge

Dr. Hughes has done a great deal
of work in this field already. From
1958 to 1959 he did research in
Munich on a Fulbright Faculty Re-
search Grant. In addition Washing-
ton and Lee has suppored summer
research by him with Glenn Grants.

To Compile Text

Dr. Hughes has been very active
in the organization of national meet-
ings in this field. He is one of the
founders and currently program
chairman of the Society for the His-
tory of Technology. This society has
a large membership of people from
many walks of life. Next year’s pres-
ident will be Mervin J. Kelly, for-
mer head of the Bell Research Lab-
oratories.

Dr. Hughes will be extremely busy
in the next year. This summer he
will complete a two volume text
on the History of Technology, of
which he is co-author with Professor
Robert S. Woodbury of the Massa-

chusetts Institute of Technology.
This text will be printed in the
spring by Prentice-Hall.

During the first semester next

year, Dr. Hughes will serve as visit-
ing associate Professor of History at
M.LT. He will be taking the place
of Professor Woodbury, who wil! be
studying abroad under a Guggen-
heim Grant.

 

New History Field: Technology

The second semester he will spend
as visiting Professor of History at
the University of Wisconsin. The
purpose of this stay will be to intro-
duce the history of technology to
the student body there.

Dr. Hughes is looking forward to
this experience because it will en-
able him to carry out research and
to teach, while actually having the
two combined. “I will take the stu-
dents’ questions to the library and
try to come up with some answers,”
he said. The students will also take
active part in some research.

Kell, Essex
Will Attend
NCAA Meet

Tomorrow W&L trackmen Skip
Essex and Robin Kell will compete
in the NCAA Eastern regional cham-
pionships in Petersburg, Va.

Skip Essex is W&L’s outstanding
quarter miler, holding this year’s
record in the quarter mile at a time
of 49.9 seconds, which was good
for second place in the Virginia
State meet in Lynchburg.

At the Davidson relays Essex an-
chored the sprint medley team to
establish a new meet record. Skip
plans to compete only in the half
mile Saturday.

Robin Kell, who holds the school
record in the hop, step, and jump
with a leap of 44 feet 5 inces, and
the year’s record in the high jump
}; with a six feet 1/4 inch jump, will
jj compete only in the high jump as
Kell’s favorite event, the hop, step,
and jump, is not offered.

At the state meet Kell tied for
first place in the high jump and took
second in the hop, step, and jump.

Jim Hickey this year is ineligible
for competition, since he has been
on the varsity team for four years,
and the NCAA allows only three
years of varsity competition for its
participants.

Individuals Perform Well

Despite Poor Team Records

By STEVE HIBBARD

Though certain Washington and
Lee teams cannot boast records like
that of the football squad, their sea-
sons haven’t gone without high
points of interest.

The baseball team which posted
a 2-13-1 record has received little
notice of its individual standouts.
Senior Robin Wood was the most
consistent hitter on the team with
a seanson’s average of .298. Fielding,
necessary to any ball club, and
Park Gilmore’s improvement in the

obligations demanded much of his
time, but he made it a point to work
with his team as much as possible.

The lacrosse team has had a sea-
son much like that of the baseball
team .It has a young squad with
half of its players freshmen; how-
ever, it is hard to pass over indi-
viduals such as Ray Miller, John
McDaniel, and Charley Gummey
without recognizing their efforts.
Miller, who played goal for the first
time this year, will probably end up
leading the country in saves with an
average of 25 a game. Gummey was

double play helped the Generals out
of some tight spots.

Pitching was a problem through-
out the season, but the work of
Phil Sharp was commendable. Also,
freshman Mace McGowin’s steady
improvement shows a definite strong
point in next year’s team.

The valuable asset of Captain Ned
Hobbs can’t be overlooked. His other

Coach Joe Lyles is cautiously hopeful about the 1962 soc-

Track Has Best
Spring Season

This spring has been a long, hard
one for the Washington and Lee
athletic department.

With but one intercollegiate con-
test remaining, a varsity lacrosse
match with the powerful U.Va. team,
the combined record for baseball,
varsity and JV_ lacrosse, golf,
tennis, and track is 24-31-1.

The baseball team concluded the
season with a 2-13-1 record. The tie
resulted from an 8-8, fifteen inning
game with Bridgewater which was
called because of darkness.

The varsity lacrosse team carries
a record of one victory and ten
defeats as it prepares to face the
Virginia team. The lone win came at
the expense of the University of
North Carolina team. The JV la-
crosse team chalked up a successful
4-1 season record. Both the golf and

Life Savers
Cite Cargill
For Bravery

It was a strange turn of luck that
enabled three Washington and Lee
students to save a 57-year-old man
from drowning Saturday.

The students happened to hear
the man yelling for help because
they met a car carrying some friends,
and stopped on the road. James Car-
gill, Allen Northcutt, and Tom Ed-
wards found Gilbert Blackwell
clinging to a tree on the side of a
high cliff above Maury River. They
stayed to watch him while others
called the Lexington rescue squad.

Blackwell Falls From Cliff

Before the rescue squad could
arrive, the man fell from the cliff
into the river. The trio immediately
decided to go to his aid, and they
were lucky enough to have brought
an inner tube in their car. They
used the tube to float Blackwell
to the shore.

Cargill said that a farmer living
in the area had heard Blackwell
shouting for about an hour, but
hadn’t been able to locate him.
Blackwell had been walking on the
top of the cliff when he fell.

Didn’t Know Help Had Arrived

The students could not know how
long Blackwell had been hanging
on the cliff; or the fact that his
vision is so poor that he couldn’t
see that help had arrived. Cargill
said he had thought the man could
see him, but later learned that
Blackwell is close to being blind.

Praised Highly

As a result of the rescue the three
were pictured on the front page of
the Richmond Times-Dispatch, and
received notice in other papers also.

The captain of the Lexington Life
Saving and First Aid Crew, Roy
Snyder, wrote a letter to President
Cole in praise of the rescue. Snyder
said:

“These boys did an outstanding
rescue job for which our crew is
most grateful. I’m sure they were
responsible for saving Mr. Black-
well’s life....

“We are proud to have such boys
in our community.”

Blackwell came out of the inci-
dent with a broken leg. He might
have lost his life had not the stu-
dents stopped to talk within hear-
ing distance of the 100-foot cliff
where he was hanging.

 

Caps And Gowns

Caps and gowns will be in the
Student Union basement tomorrow
; from 11:30 to 5:30. They must be
returned June 8. Graduation invita-
' tions are available at the Co- -op.

 

Though this was his first artistic
|endeavor, Captain Kable’s efforts
| pleased the college authorities suf-
| ficiently to warrant payment of $100.

Many patrons of the college
| thought the fee extravagant since
the replica did not closely resemble

Washington. The C Captain was heard
to answer his critics, “Well, I ain't
never seen George in person!”

There are several interesting
| Stories which have grown up over
ithe statue. One has it that the
| Union Army was dissauded from
burning the school at the sight of
| the father of their country. This is
|reputed, however, by Lexington
folk who maintain that the Yankees
mistook George for Jefferson Davis,
and were thoroughly intending on
razing the school when the town
| lovelies rushed to the rescue.

* This move, the first change in the
W&L political situation in several
years, gives the University Party
eleven houses with the remaining
seven in the Independent Party.
Also, the addition of SPE’s fifty votes
gives the University Party a major-
ity in the student body.

In an interview last night, Burke
explained that the University Party
was approached and learned of the
desire of SPE to become affiliated
with the University Party. A “party
clique” was called to consider the
position of SPE in the Independent
Party and our own position, Burke
stated.

At this meeting Warren Mills, SPE
political chairman, appeared before
the UP houses and explained why
SPE was desirous of becoming a
member of the University Party.

After deliberation the UP houses
voted unanimously to accept the
SPE chapter on equal terms with the
other houses in the party.

‘Unfair Treatment’

Warren Mills stated last night,
“During SPE’s membership in the
Independent Party, we realized that
the party is dominated by certain
houses, which did not provide for
fair and equal treatment of the fra-
ternities in the party.” He also
stated that realizing the situation,
the house decided to explore the
possibility of becoming affiliated with
the University Party. In his words,
“We felt that in the University Par-
ty our house as well as the other
houses will be accorded equal traeat-
ment.”

SPE house president Jack Cover
stated, “I, as well as the rest of the
house, was pleased upon learning
that the University Party had ap-
proved our becoming affiliated with
them.” Cover also expressed his
confidence in the mutual desires of
SPE and the University Party to
improve the political situation on
the W&L campus by consistently
putting up candidates of the highest
caliber regardless of house affilia-
tion,

Burke Cites Leadership

Speaking on behalf of the Uni-
versity Party, Burke stated, “We
were pleased to welcome the SPE’s
into the University Party. The SPE’s,
in the three years that they have
been on the W&L campus, have
contributed much to the University
and have displayed proved leader-
ship.

“I believe that this move will be
beneficial to the University, and the
University Party will continue in
the future to nominate the most
qualified men for political offices.”

This move greatly strengthens the
position of the University Party on
campus both in votes taken by
houses and in student body and class
elections.

The addition of the SPE’s fresh-
man class of 22 gives the University
Party a definite majority in that
class, which they failed to carry in
the recent class elections.

advancing age, but as a painter re-
marked not too many summers ago,

Political System Falls
To New Depths

Washington and Lee’s already maligned political system has
now taken another turn for the worse. The SPE’s decision to
change political parties now throws the political balance even

more out of proportion.

The wisdom of this move is highly questionable. The
SPE’s contend that they were not getting a “fair shake” in the

Independent Party. However,

reason for the switch. It may be noted that that house has won
two positions in the freshman class in the recent class elections.
This is more than some of the houses in the University Party.
What is necessary to satisfy them?

No matter what the reasons, the move has been made.
There is no longer any semblance of a political balance. Poli-
tics at Washington and Lee will soon come to look even more
like the politics of the state. The contest will be decided in the

clique meetings.

This is not the way a political system should function.
There can be no real contest when one party contains a large
majority even before the ballots are cast. This could have
serious and detrimental consequences.

If we are not careful, the so called “gravy train” could
wreck the whole system of student government. With condi-
tions being what they are, it would take only one or two mis-
placed political candidates to seriously injure the already pre-
carious position of student government.

It will be interesting to note the final outcome of this
switch. This may be only the beginning of a major shake up
of politics at W&L. With new members in a party, here will
be less plums to be passed out. This could result in some hungry
and dissatisfied houses which could easily bring about further

this can hardly be the full

 

Opinions Vary On Academic
Opportunities W&L Offers

Brown Protests Against Apathy

To the Editor:

We are all aware that many of
the ablest among our Freshmen and
Sophomores are leaving us_ for
greener pastures. But that is accept-
ed as a matter of fact and few
seem to really care.

The fact is that there is something
dreadfully worng.

The deviate, the maverick is lost
here. He can hope to be nothing
more than an anonymous integer
in a data processing mechanism
which ignores identity and concen-
trates on an incomprehensible sta-
tistical norm. We are examined,
tested, retested, observed, checked,
cross-checked, filed and cross-filed.
But we are not educated.

Education
The educational process here, as
elsewhere, has become a ritualistic
and reflex enterprise. And to this
static and wholly confining ritual the
creative student is sacrificed. The
individual factor is ignored—the
yearning for growth and expansive

experimentation denied.

We live on a treadmill, afraid to
stay on, afraid to get olf.

Our goals are obscurred, our
standards obliterated. Education it-
self has become an accidental by-
product in the race for ratings. The
yardstick has become an end in
itself!

and panic—these are the products
of minds crushed and subverted to
a mechanical starndard which is

Notices

There will be a short meeting
of this year’s and next year’s busi-
ness staff of the Ring-tum Phi in
the Student Union at 7:00 tonight.

Due to final examinations, this is
the last edition of the Ring-tum Phi
that will come out until the Finals

know it. But we can not get away
from it and we know that also.

Observed
We are observed, and tend to ob-
serve ourselves, in fragments but
never for what we are in full. We
are conditioned for a life-time of
testing but never to locate ourselves
by our own standards.
This is human pigeon-holing run
amuck!
In the race for superior ratings
we must conform or fail. Conse-
quently, we learn to accept things at
their face value and we rarely ques-

 

tion. We deal in stereotypes and

general poor quality of, the profes-
sors. After having completed almost
two years at W&L, I have come to
change my former opinion as to the
merit of this University. Too many
of us I am afraid, rely too much
upon other people for our own in-
tellectual stimulation.

In expressing what W&L means to
me, I would use these two words:
FREEDOM and OPPORTUNITY.
The student here has great FREE-
DOM—all that is actually required
of him is class attendance, and even
this is not required of students hav-
ing B averages. The Honor System
provides the greatest freedom of
all—there is no illegal competition
from students doing dishonest work:

 

 

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

 

must live behind their masks. We
settle for the status-quo so that our
ratings will not be desolated. and yet
we know, deep within us, that su-
perior rating is not always the pro-
duct of superior performance.

The interchange of ideas, long
hours spent in animated debate
deep into the night, the vast ad-
venture of a new discovery about
self and the world about us, the
growth of the mind, are all lost
in the rat-race for an artificial,
impersonal, and new meaningless
rating.

Motivation

Motivation is not the problem. We
are motivated as no other genera-
tion has ever been. But we are de-
nied the chance to follow the chan-
nels into which the motivating forces
lead us.

The fault is not entirely ours nor
are we entirely guiltless.

But the tragedy is that those
who leave these halis may find
that the problem which they
sought to escape has preceded or
followed them. It is not Washing-
ton and Lee’s alone.

Anachronism
The anachronism is to some ex-
tent universal. Our educational fa-
cilities are all too often out of joint
with the age in which we live.
Duplication and feed-back is pri-
mary. We are parrots. Creative
learning is dead.
Respectfully,

BEN JARRATT BROWN

Rider Speaks
Dear Sir:

Several letters have been publish-
ed during the past few weeks in
the Ring-tum Phi concerning the
lack of intellectual challenge at

Washington and Lee. W&L has been
described as a “high school” and as

writers of these articles plan not to
return to the University in the fall.

Earlier this year, I, too, wrote a
letter criticizing W&L for its poor
classroom environment and for the

being “anti-intellectual.” Some of the | &

a student’s grade point ratio rep-
resents entirely his own honest ef-
forts. The OPPORTUNITY is present
in the liberal degree requirements,
in the small classroom environment,
in the personal contact which a stu-
dent can have with his professors,
and in the great amount of time
present beyond the regular class
meeting hours.

This great freedom is a difficult
thing to cope with—the individual
student is not led by the hand and
shown how he should spend _ his
time or told how to plan his stu-
dies. The student must himself de-
cide how much time to spend in
studying, what to study, and how
best to digest the material. Perhaps
the majority of the students here
may be described as “anti-intellec-
tual” and are in fact too social-
centered, but there are many fine
hardworking men on this campus
who are seeking a firm academic
background. Wherever a person goes,
it may well be that his own interest

Last Word;
Praises WGEL

By HOWARD SLATER
Friday Columnist

The little row we've been hav-
ing among ourselves about boys
leaving and boys staying is a wel-
come interruption to the usual rou-
tine of nothingness in which we
tend to exist. If nothing else, people
have shown that they care about
something—whether it is the school,
intoxication, or good-clean-fellow-
ship. Concern, even if it is no more
than a distaste for beards, is far
preferable to vibrant indifference.

Let me get a few thing straight,
however. First I do not at all re-
sent being likened to Moses; he
seems to have been a pretty good
sort. Second, the column I wrote
which provoked so many indignant
responses was not essentially about
“beer”—it was about concern, about
people caring, especially we here
at Washington and Lee. This has
been the only true theme in the
articles I have written all year
long. And with all the disagreeable
things that have been said, it is in-
teresting to see that the response of
people caring only occurred when
the ostensible issue of “beer” was
raised.

If this is the sore-spot which will
provoke the student body, then it
was worth writing an admittedly
exaggerated article to stir things
up. If beer rallies really do fur-
ther closer human relations between
students, and if those who say that
they do sincerely believe this, ther
let us all subscribe to the belief. It
is a worthy value. Those who are
willing to stand by the value of
closer relations deserve more credit
than those who would simply poke
fun at our little comic debate. (Only,
please, let’s steer clear of beards;
they should not be an issue here.)

The problem with this accommo-
dating approach is that those who
say “You can go; we're satisfied;
we'll stay at the Paramount,” aren’t
really concerned at all. They don’t
care, because if they did, they
would be forced to admit that not
everything is hunkey-dory. This
they do not seem willing to do.

But it would be a shame not to
make the last word one of praise,
as well as dissatisfaction. This is a
fine school, and we cannot have not
gained a great deal from it. Best of
all, improvements are coming at a
heartening rate. While we say, truth-
fully, that our professors are not
perfect, and that there is much room

Virginia Routs Stickmen By 14-3 Score

McDaniel And Gummey Score;
Final Game Of The Season

By AL JOHNSTON

The Washington and Lee Lacrosse
team lost it final game of the season
to the University of Virginia 14-3,
here Saturday.

Hy Lavaseur led the scoring for
the Cavaliers with 4 goals and John
McDaniel was credited with two
of the Generals’ goals.

The score was 4-1 at halftime,
W&L having given the favored Vir-
ginia team a rough battle.

Leading 8-3 going into the last
period U. Va. broke the game wide
open with four consecutive goals
within a three-minute span, Lav-

Weak Hitting
Poor Effort Is
Team’s Trouble

By CHUCK LANE

When the 1961 baseball team
finished with an 8-4 record, every-
one looked forward to the 1962
season as the probable height of
W&L baseball fortunes.

There were lettermen returning
at every position, the pitching staff
was experienced, and a new crop
of freshmen were to add invaluable
bench strength. However, on the
spring trip, weak pitching and spot-
ty hitting caused the Generals to
return with a 1-4 record.

This trend continued through the
year when several individuals
turned in brilliant performances at
times, but there was no sustained
effort by the entire team. Robin
Wood led the W&L nine to their
best performance of the year de-
feating William and Mary, 9-6,
avenging an earlier loss.

Captain Ned Hobbs and Park Gil-
more anchored the infield corps and
Bob Williams and Robin Wood did
excellent service in the outfield.
Jim Russ and Ashley Allen came
into their own behind the plate in
the latter part of the season and
cut down several attempts at steal-
ing second which had plagued the
team earlier.

Mason MecGowin, Phil Sharp, Lou
Paterno, Chris Wigert and Brice
Gamber all came on strong near
the end of the season, but the hitters
could not manage to push across the
necessary runs at crucial times, and
consequently several games were
lost my small margins.

Next year, W&L will have eight
lettermen returning but will have
to fill several positions in both the
infield and outfield left vacant by
graduation.

 

Several new teams have been add-
ed to the schedule, including the
Univ. of Vermont, Camp Lejune
Marines, Univ. of Connecticut, aad

aseur led the drive himself by
scoring two of the goals.

W&L’'s goalie Ray Miller found
it rough going having made 13 saves
in the first period alone and ending
with 25.

Deeley Nice, Virginia’s standout
goalie, was not quite as busy as
Miller having but nine saves before
going out in the first half.

Other leading scorers for the Cal-
valiers were McGill and Davies, both
having thrown in two.

The last General score of the
game was registered by Charlie
Gummey who seemed to have a
hard time finding his aim earlier
in the contest.

The hostility between W&L and
the Cavaliers seems to have mani-
fested itself Saturday as the Uni-
versity of Virginia amassed a total
of 14 personal fouls to the Generals’
three.

Coach McHenry’s team ended the
season with one win and 11 losses.

Although such senior standouts
as captain Bart Michell, All-South
goalie Ray Miller and defense-
man Bill Wheeler will be absent
next season, McHenry feels that
he has enough ability in this year’s
freshman and junior class to carry
the team through a more success-
ful season next spring.

Charlie Gummey, Bob Van
Rensselaer, and Dan Reed are the

 

 

Co-captains-elect for the ’63 season.

Coach McHenry’s Forces
End Year With 1-11 Slate

After dropping a 14-3 decision to
the University of Virginia here,
Saturday, the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team wound up with an
unimpressive season record of 1-11.

Lack Experience

The lacrosse team began the sea-
son with a decisive handicap as ten
of the twenty men on the squad
were freshmen. Coach McHenry
feels that this was a great setback
since many of these more unex-
perienced players had to be used
against well-developed “machines”
such as Baltimore University and
Johns Hopkins.

McHenry said that there were
only six strong players on the
team. Ray Miller should be highly
praised for the adjustment he
made after switching from crease
attack to goalie. Miller leads the
nation in saves and has been chos-
en as the South’s goal tender in
the North-South game to be play-
ed at Rutgers, June 9.

At defense, Bob Van Rensselaer
and Bart Mitchell did exceptional
jobs. Mitchell scored twice this sea-
son which is unusual for a defense-
man,

John McDaniel

John McDaniel and Charlie Gum-
mey were outstanding for the Gen-
erals offensively as they were first

 

and second respectively in scoring
for the squad. Gummey also must
be credited for controlling most of
the face-offs this season.

Coach McHenry

Coach McHenry feels that the
team’s best effort was its 15-4 de-
feat at the hands of Johns Hop-
kins. He said, though, that the high-
light of the season was the Gen-
erals lone victory over UNC, who
they whipped 9-4,

Many of the games this season
were relatively close and Mce-
Henry feels that with a few
breaks, several of these could have
gone either way. He cited es-
pecially the 6-5 loss to Washington
College and the 6-3 defeat at the
hand of Hofstra.

Next year the lacrosse team will
be losing only two lettermen so,
with some new talent and the ex-
perience gained by this year’s young
squad, Coach McHenry is rather op-
timistic that the 1963 season will
prove to be a more successful one.

 

Notice

The annual sports barbecue will
be held as scheduled at Coach Mc-
Laughlin’s camp tomorrow. All
sports awards, trophies and mono-
grams will be presented to team
members.

 

Soccer Team Selves Alsunei. 5-1

By PETE ALFORD

The varsity soccer team won 5-1
over an aggregate of aging alumni
and aspiring second stringers last
Friday after a week of spring soc-
cer practice.

Coach Joe Lyles’ regulars, using
new line formation, pumped in three
goals in the first half and two in
the last half to secure the win.
Dave Knight, former W&L cap-
tain tallied in the final minutes
for the only alumni score.

Sophomore Charlie Sweet with
three goals and Jim Melfi, who
put in two, accounted for the
Generals’ scoring.

Joining these two on the line are

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Supon Hits
Letter Writers

It seems from the letters and ar-
ticles which have been appearing in
the Ring-tum Phi during the last
couple of weeks that the Bearded
Prophet is rapidly turning into
Lexington’s answer to Moses, lead-
ing the dissatisfied student body
away to a promised land.

I am certain that Mr. Slater and
Mr. Walker could find a_ school
somewhere at which “the Hill” is
in complete control of all activities,
in which there is no such thing as
a beer rally, and in which there is a
great emphasis upon academics with
no social life at all.

However, if anyone believes that
academics are supposed to be the
main part of life at W&L, he is
obviously sadly mistaken. One of the
avowed purposes of the University
is to prepare students for all facets
of a successful life—a life which
needs social training as well as that
to be found in books and classrooms.

But, since these two gentlemen
seem so set upon leaving, then let
them. And I sincerely hope that they
find their Valhalla for Angry Young
Men somewhere.

Sincerely,
WILLIAM SU?PON

The team will report for early on the
13th of September. Their first game

group will be in the minority—his
own values and motivations should
not stem from what the majority
holds to be good. Ultimately, each
man must stand alone and be able
to work and act out of consideration
for his own motives and interests.
There exists at W&L the oppor-
tunity for an excellent education—
it is primarily up to each student to
make the most of this oppurtunily.
Granted that there are some profes-
sors who are not doing their best in
the classroom—but there are also a
good number of stimulating teachers
who are competent and dedicated.
Washington and Lee is by no means
a perfect institution, but there are
many men, both students and faculty,
who are seeking to improve the
University and to make it an even
finer place for academic endeavor.
Each student has the responsibility
of accepting the great—and diffi-
cult—freedom and opportunity pres-
ent for education at Washington
and Lee.

for improvement, still we ought ‘o
acknowledge that they have helped
us greatly, do have concern for us,
and do make the effort to improve.
The ultimate dissatisfaction must
come, therefore, from our own fail-
ure to grasp and utilize the oppor-
tunities we have been given. It is
inevitable that we should fail in
some measure in achieving this goal.
To the extent that we have suc-
ceeded, that much should we rejoice.
(By this qualification, I hope that
you have been saved from a year-
bookish eulogy.) But to the extent
that we concede our failure, in this
we will have also succeeded; and
since college is just a beginning—
of academic knowledge as well as
other kinds of lessons—then this
will be the best part of it all.

Coach Lyles lists his primary
needs for next year as a right

two or three outfielders to compen-
sate for the loss of seven seniors.
He says that the amount of husile
displayed by the younger members
will make up for the loss of ex-
perienced men, and should give
W&L a successful season in 63.

Room For Improvement In Many Aspects

By ROBERT ROY GOODWIN, II
Tuesday Edition Editor

Following a tradition established many
years ago, I, as editor of the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi, wish to leave the students, the faculty and
the Washington and Lee community a summa-
tion of the goals, the ambitions, and the ideals
I feel Washington and Lee would do well to
envision.

It is my purpose in writing this editorial
not to criticize where criticism is unwarranted,
but it is my desire that through my words
perhaps Washington and Lee can in some
small way better herself, and in the long run,
improve the men who graduate from our
University every year.

It is my sincere hope that my effort will be
met with the idea that I have the best interests
of Washington and Lee at heart—for I be-
lieve that I do.

Some areas will be discussed with more
emphasis than others. I sincerely hope that my
thoughts will be met with a sense of good
faith, for I assure my readers that it is with
the above in mind that I present my thoughts
for your acceptance or rejection.

ACADEMICS

The logical place to start any swan song
of a college career is with academics. It seems
to me that it would be sheer folly to say that
Washington and Lee can be satisfied with re-
maining the same—no institution devoted to
educating students can remain in a stagnant
form and hope to produce leaders who will
challenge our rapidly changing world.

Washington and Lee needs to realize and
to rededicate herself to the idea that she can-
not retain the status quo. In too many areas
of University life W&L has failed to realize
this idea. Washington and Lee must face the
facts that both her faculty and her physical
plant must be improved, or we only stand to
lose in the race toward academic excellence.

I am the first to realize that many improve-
ments can only come from an adequate finance
program, therefore, I can understand why
many revisions have not been made. As I have
suggested in earlier editions, Washington and
Lee needs to rejuvenate her program for ob-
taining financial help. Our Alumni should be
made to realize that it is them that we look
to. Far too often, Washington and Lee stu-
dents leave the campus never to return and
never again to be heard from.

Where can we use money for improve-
ments? The first problem immediately facing
our institution is that of faculty salaries. It

By WILLIAM LEE ROBERTS, JR.
Friday Edition Editor

This year has been one of dizzying chang-
es and announcements at Washington and Lee.
Much has been done to improve the Univer-
sity and much has been done with that hope
which we feel represents a step back rather
than an improvement.

We have criticized what seems to us a good
deal of intellectual flabbiness here and we have
seriously questioned the benefits which will
come from the new athletic conference, or
from closer faculty regulation of fraternity
and social affairs.

Through it all there seem to us to have
been several general problems which are not
so easily resolved or so simple as many the
University has. They are much more im-
portant, however.

We feel that the trustees, faculty, admin-
istration, and most of all, the students, must
face the problems of segregation and inter-
gration squarely. The entire University com-
munity has shown a ganeral lack of interest
in moral or social questions of any kind.
Race relations is the biggest moral and social
question in the United States at present, and
will continue to be for some time. It should
be a subject of active debate, both as it re-
gards W&L’s admission policy and as a gen-
eral problem with which every W&L graduate
who takes a position of leadership will have to
deal. A few courageous professors, like Dr.
Leyburn and Dr. Hodges, have ventured to
discuss the problem where it concerns their
classes. It appears to us that the men who dis-
agree with their liberal views have defaulted

is a known fact that Washington and Lee is
not famous for having the most lucrative sal-
aries, although I believe she is at present doing
an adequate job to remedy this problem. Too
many professors, who often are among the
best in their fields, leave Washington and Lee
for the benefits that can be obtained from
larger colleges and universities, among these
being larger salaries and better physical facili-
ties in which to live and work.

The matter of facilities brings us to the
second problem immediately facing Washing-
ton and Lee. I have praised the construction of
the new science building, but I believe that we
all know that this is only a beginning. Wash-
ington and Lee is hindered by a lack of ade-
quate facilities, which stands as a living testi-
mony that W&L needs more money than pre-
viously has been raised to insure the comple-
tion of mandatory projects.

It is perhaps too obvious to say that we
need a new gymnasium; to say that we need
better facilities for journalism; to say that we
need better departmental libraries, and to
assert that we desperately need improvement
in nearly all the Washington College buildings.
Even though it may seem redundant to reiter-
ate these obvious points, I believe that these
improvements must be made in the very near

future.
Ww

Washington and Lee, to come to the some-
what belated point of ‘‘Academics,” was rated
by the Chicago Tribune in 1955 as being the
ninth best small men’s college in the United
States. It would indeed be interesting to see
where we stand today. Perhaps we have ad-
vanced a notch or two (now that we have a
Commons) and perhaps we have regressed —
the question seems to be a moot one. But the
question brings to mind many policies that are
being followed by the University today which
are in many ways not in step with progress.

Among these policies, I would cite the
over preponderance of rules and regulations
which constantly haunt the student. Final
absence and over cuts—which deduct from
one’s credits for juniors and seniors, and from
one’s grade for freshmen and sophomores—
are a bit prep-schoolish, to use a neatly coined
term. A revised grading system which ensures
a larger point span would be in order, and
standing policies which in some ways inhibit
the manner in which a professor can teach a
course (namely the rule of having to give a
final examination) should be reconsidered and
revised.

Too many professors continue to rely on
their moth-eaten notes; too many professors

Is Strong;

the question by not taking open issue. Surely
there are more men in this University who
can take a well considered position on the
subject.

There is a general problem here with re-
gard to questions of values. It seems to us that
our teachers have hidden behind the
shield of ‘“‘scholarly objectivity” too long.
The best scholars and teachers here never
have, but there are far too many men on the
faculty who refuse to take a stand for fear
of being proven wrong, or even being dis-
agreed with by others. This is a disservice to
free inquiry. The professor will occupy the
focal point of learning at W&L as long as the
present course-and-hour and cut system pre-
vails. Persistent avoidance of intellectual is-
sues, through laziness, or fear, or incompe-
tence, has dulled more than one student’s in-
terest. A little scholarly controversy could be
one of the best things that could happen to
this university.

Another equally bad problem is parochial-
ism. Much has been made of the fact that
scientists and technologists have difficulty ex-
plaining the problems and questions of their
fields to men who do not have a technical
background. Yet political and business leaders
have constantly to make technical and scien-
tific decisions with the most limited under-
standing of those questions.

Washington and Lee can do a real service
to her students—and professors—by setting
up closer ties between the science departments
and the arts, business, and journalism schools.
Dr. Hughes in the history department has
done much to make his students aware of the

are content with doing only the minimum,
often overlooking the possibility of stimulat-
ing their students.

Too many professors retain the policy of
“grooving” the student, and too often pro-
fessors show partiality to students who are
majors in their departments—disregarding
talent if it happens to appear in one of their
classes simply because they are from “this”
or “that” department.

Too many professors bicker among them-
selves—overlooking the real goals of Wash-
ington and Lee—which points up the need
for more inter-departmental cooperation.

In short, academics at Washington and
Lee can and must be improved. A constant
effort must be maintained to keep the ideals
of a Liberal Arts education in mind. Curricu-
lum changes which have been made recently
are for the best, but there is still much work to
be done. I leave this work to the Washington
and Lee of 1962.

FRATERNITIES

This school year has been characterized,
at least from the standpoint of the social
fraternities, as being one of conflict between
the Administration and the IFC. Two major
occasions saw “The Hill’ move with swift
actions: namely the presenting of the faculty
rush petition and the curbing of fraternity
combos during the hours of University social
functions. Perhaps these two incidents would
not have caused so much furor had they been
handled better by both the IFC and the Uni-
versity, but this is water over the dam. I can
only hope that both parties have profited by
their mistakes.

Washington and Lee’s fraternity system is
by no means perfect. I sincerely believe that
if the fraternities wish to retain responsible
handling of their affairs, they are going to
have to realize that more interest is going to
have to be shown in the fraternity system itself
and in the IFC.

More responsible leadership is needed in
the fraternities. It is depressing to see that
only six of the 18 fraternities last semester
had averages above the all men’s figure. It is
even more discouraging to realize that many
houses have contented themselves with their
plights, and have resigned themselves to doing
little or nothing about their standing.

Another area concerning fraternities that
needs an immediate re-examination is that of
finances. Excessive spending should be elimi-
nated where it is possible, and fraternity lead-
ers must realize that not every member has
unlimited finances.

Could Be

importance of technology in history and the
Commerce School seems to be placing in-
creasing emphasis on quantitative methods in
business and economics. The mathematics de-
partment has instituted a more rigorous fresh-
man program,

These are all steps in the right direction.
We feel, however, that increased science re-
quirements for the B.A. degree, and more
courses designed to meet the needs of arts ma-
jors are the only solution. W&L is fortunate to
have strong departments in all the sciences.
We feel it would be to the advantage of our
scientists to teach more liberal arts men as
well as a great advantage to the arts men
themselves.

Parochialism is also evident in the heavy
load of vocational courses required in the
journalism and commerce departments at the
expense of the basic studies, such as history,
English, and economics, which underly the
so-called professional disciplines. It does a man
little good to take professional training in “the
liberal arts atmosphere” if this acquaintance-
ship with the liberal disciplines is unplanned
and held to only 25-30 per cent of his study.

We would press our complaints with the
faculty and administration further if the stu-
dent body showed more of the drive and ac-
complishment of which they are capable. It is
discouraging to see the prevailing extrava-
gance of money and time among students at
the expense of their undoubted academic
abilities. Men who are incapable of the most
basic social and financial discipline can hardly
be expected to show much intellectual disci-
pline. It seems to us that the student body of-

As far as the IFC is concerned, it is ob-
vious that the group needs to take a close
look at some of its functions and obligations.
It has ben said by many people that the
IFC could be the most influential group on
campus next to the EC.

The IFC and the fraternities, will never
grow in prestige if they reject the idea that
Washington and Lee does have ultimate con-
trol of fraternities and that the fraternities
don’t exercise control of Washington and Lee.

We have seen a partial re-vitalizing of the
IFC take place this year, mainly due to the
positive leadership of Bob Doenges. This
trend, if it may be called a trend, is encourag-
ing, and I hope that it is here to stay. Without
positive steps aimed at bettering Washington
and Lee first as a University and second as a
fraternity school, the IFC may find itself over-
looked when it comes to matters of student af-
fairs. I hope, however, that the fraternities
realize that they have only one way to go—
forward,

The University needs  fraternities—it
would be ridiculous to assert that W&L could
get along without them. Fraternities do indeed
provide a positive force, and they are certainly
excellent means for expressing social outlets
and comradeship, just to mention a minimum
of benefits gained from them. To remove
these forces would be a mistake, and I feel
that the Administration and a large majority
of the faculty realize the positive forces fra-
ternities can exert.

As far as Washington and Lee is con-
cerned, the direction in which we seem to be
moving is ahead. Given capable leadership
and an adequate finance program, W&L can
make even greater strides than she has in the
past.

If Washington and Lee retains ideals that
such fine men as Dean Frank J. Gilliam have
given us, we can only move in one direction—
and that direction is ahead.

w

To appreciate the combined efforts that
go into the publishing of the Ring-tum Phi,
an attempt at expression is to thank those
many students and University personnel whose
contributions have made the success of our
newspaper possible. I would like to pay partic-
ular tribute to the columnists, and to the staff
of the Tuesday Edition for their many hours
of tedious work. To Mr. Harold Lauck for
the efforts of the members of the Journalism
Lab Press, which is staffed by Lynwood Pullen,
Edward Backus, Edwin Walker and Donald
Tabbut, I am deeply grateful and indebted.

Better

ficers, fraternity leaders, and Ring-tum Phi
can expect a much stronger influence on their
fellows for greater academic and personal ac-
complishment.

We would not offer any of these criticisms
if we did not feel that the University is capable
of greater improvements, as proven by past
and present accomplishments.

We will take many happy memories, and
what we feel to be a solid educational back-
ground, with us from Washington and Lee.
Many schools can claim some of W&L’s vir-
tues but we know of no other place that com-
bines so many of them. Where can you find
a deeper and more generous mutual respect
between the students on one hand and the fac-
ulty and administration on the other? Or a
happier combination of academic pursuits with
a full social life?

At a time when concepts of honor and
duty seem to be deteriorating, we still attempt
to live up to the highest standards of person-
al honor. Despite faculty control of academic
and social matters, the student body still con-
trols the honor system and makes it work. The
inflexible assurance that our fellow students
do not lie, cheat, or steal is our greatest pride
and our greatest responsibility.

Washington and Lee means all these
things and more. It is a great university, an
educational institution known more for its
men than its institutions; proclaiming the high-
est ideals and doing its best to live up to them.

We can only express our general thanks
and hope that we have in some small way
helped to make W&L better for future gen-
erations of “General Lee’s boys.”

Washington and Lee will enroll a
freshman class this fall of approx-
imately 330 men—the largest fresh-
man class in 15 years.

Dean Frank J. Gilliam said today
that the increase over the 320 figure
set for the past fall results from the
occupancy of the new freshman dor-
mitory.

Using the new dorm, he said, will
remove the necessity of using any of
the space in Baker Dormitory for
freshmen, permit the elimination of
inadequate facilities in the present
University Place, and make unneces-~
sary the placing of a second man in
a good many of the rooms in the
main Freshman Dorm that were
originally built as single rooms.

Enrollment Largest
Dean Gilliam added that the en-

rollment anticipated will be the
largest of any freshman class apart
from the several years immediately
following World War H, when all
colleges endeavored to make places
for as many veterans as possible.

The actual number of candidates
who have now confirmed accep-
tance is approximately 338, Dean
Gilliam added. The margin over
330 is set up to take care of any
possible cancellations.

Giving a breakdown of the
figures, Dean Gilliam said that the
next year’s class will be composed
of 58 per cent public school stu-

dents and 42 per cent from private
schools.

For the past three sessions, he

added, the figures have been fixed

Broader Distribution

The increase in public school stu-
dents admitted indicates broader
geographical distribution, according
to Dean Gilliam. Only one public
school, Ft. Worth’s Arlington Heights
High School, is sending as many as
four boys; three are entering from
Bethesda-Chevy Chase (Md.), Ca-
tonsville (Md.), Thomas Jefferson
(Dallas), E. C. Glass (Lynchburg),
Millburn (N. J.), and Atherton
(Louisville) High Schools. Twenty-
four public schools are sending two
boys each to Washington and Lee

Professors Cited For Teachin g Ability

TWELVE MEN PRAISED FOR AID TO W&L

By the Editors

As a feature of this Finals Edi-
tion of the Ring-tum Phi, the edi-
tors thought it appropriate to single
out a small group of faculty mem-
bers for their outstanding teaching
abilities which places them at the
top of the list of the best teachers
at Washington and Lee.

After a great deal of discussion—
and argument—twelve men _ were
chosen. There are a number of
other professors at W&L who are
just as competent as the men dis-
cussed here, but those we cite are
certainly representative of the best
this university has to offer.

At first glance, this group of out-
standing professors seems to have
little in common. They vary in rank
from instructor to full professor;
in age, from their late twenties to
sixtyish. Some are among the most
demanding teachers here; others
don’t ask very much for a “C.”

What they do have in common
is a contagious enthusiasm for
their field of study, a sure know-
ledge of their subject matter, and
a fair way of grading their stu-
dents,

The editors didn’t use this as a
criterion, but one of the professors
chosen has been active and influ-
ential in activities outside of class
and outside of his own field of
study. They are anything but the
ivory-tower type, giving freely of
their time as advisors to student
groups and as speakers for the var-
ious student associations.

Herewith, then, is the Ring-tum
Phi’s All-Star Teaching Team for
1961-62. We feel it is the least we
can do.

Dr. Thomas P. Hughes is probably
the most demanding professor in
the history department and one of
the most frustrating. He seldom
repeats facts in class the student can
read for himself in the thousand or
so pages of reading he assigns for
a typical upperclass course.

He also has a disconcerting habit
of giving in to a free-for-all discus-
sion in mid-lecture.

But few professors are more up
to date with the work in their

field than Dr. Hughes and few
history professors make such a de-
termined effort to get their stu-
dent to seek out the whys and
wherefores of events.

Among Dr. MHughes’s_ greatest
contributions to W&L are his con-
cern with the influence of technology
in history and his efforts to make
students more aware of this im-
portant field of study.

Dr. James K. Shillington, associate
professor of chemistry has made
himself known to the Washington
and Lee community in many ways.
The pre-med students know him
best for the almost unbelievable
amount of work he assigns, while
other students know him for his
many outside interests.

His method of lecturing is by
use of questions—a method which
insures that the work is done on
a day-to-day basis. His quizzes
are well thought out and to say
the least, they are challenging.

In addition to his knowledge of
chemistry, he is characterized by a
sincere desire to learn—not only in
his own particular field, but also
from other areas of scholarship.

Showing active participation in the
Troubadours, Dr. Shillington has
sincere literary interests which can
be seen throughout his work—in or
out of the laboratory.

Dr. Shillington also has the title
of having the most grades for his
students in his grade book.

Buford Stephenson, assistant pro-
fessor of German, has distinguished
himself as being an extremely in-
dividualistic teacher.

To say that his lectures are en-
lightening is not enough, for his
lectures would stand up to any of
those given by the other men listed
on this page.

A demanding professor who re-
quires a lot of work probably char-
acterizes Mr. Stephenson.

It is a well known fact that Mr.
Stephenson goes to great lengths to
bring in outside material to add in-
terest to his class sessions .

Mr. Stephenson’s couse in Modern
German Literature is regarded by
students as being one of the best
courses that the German department
has to offer.

Dr. James G, Leyburn has long
been known for his versatility as a
teacher, offering courses in four dif-
ferent departments, but most stu-
dents consider him to be at his best
in his introductory sociology courses
and in his course in the Greek and
Roman Classics in translation.

 

Ww

Lecturing in measured tones, Dr.
Leyburn’s eloquent treatment of
the ancient Greek values in his
“Classics” course and in his an-
cient history course always stimu-
lates his students to a closer ex-
amination of their own norms and
values,

For years he has been one of the
few professors at Washington and
Lee to point out the importance of
religion in the social sciences. He
has been one of the few to remind
us, in this day of “objective” schol-
arship, of the permeating influence
of religion in all areas of life. He

has been and continues to be a
great service to the University.
Then, too, we know of no one
else in the University who returns
all of the quizzes in a class of 70
in the next class period.

Many students will view the choice
of Major E. J. Roxbury as being the
surprise of the year. Upon close
examination of his work with the
ROTC department, however, the at-
titude mentioned above should fade.

Major Roxbury, in his four short
years at Washington and Lee, has
raised the level of the ROTC de-
partment from a former position of

just about being regarded as a joke,
to that of being one of the most en-
couraging to be found here.

His service to W&L in other areas
cannot go unnoticed. His active par-
ticipation in the Social Functions
Committee has helped that group
overcome many troublesome prob-
lems.

Being an informed student of the
U.S. role in military affairs, Maj.
Roxbury’s knewledge has a num-
ber of times brought him as a wel-
comed guest lecturer to many
coures.

On the basis of service to Wash-
ington and Lee—coupled with his
raising of the ROTC department—
we feel that Major Roxmury merits
our endorsement.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Editorial Staffs Laud Twelve Professors For Teaching Methods

(Continued from page 5)

The ink had barely dried on
Professor Charles F. Phillips’ Ph.D.
when he joined the W&L faculty
three years ago, but he quickly won
the respect of his students for his
clear explanation of the subtleties
of economics. Since then a growing
number of students have braved
examinations that are among the
most unpredictable in school to take
his junior and senior level courses
in government economic policy and
in the myriad implications of an
economy dominated by huge corpor-
ations,

Dr. Phillips’ great talent is in
throwing students in the middle of
conflicting economic theories rather
than presenting them with a pat
synthesis to be digested and then
promptly regurgitated on exams.
And being one of the most prolific
writers on the faculty, his students
suspect that as his ideas mature,
future W&L students may bat
around the ideas of Phillips like they
do those of the current scholar-
polemicists of economics.

Dr. Douglas Day (he received his
doctorate at the University of Vir-
ginia Sunday) has, in his two years
here as an English instructor, de-
veloped his specialties — literary
criticism and the history of the Eng-
lish novel—into two of the most pop-
ular courses in the curriculum.

Dr. Day’s classes combine well-
organized lectures with controlled
classroom discussion, His courses
are demanding, with the emphasis
on extensive outside reading.

Students who wish to talk to Dr.
Day outside the classroom never fail
to find him patient and interested.

Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy’s know-
ledgeable enthusiasm for the works
of Shakespeare and the English Ro-
mantics has made his courses in their
works among the most popular in the
University.

A W&L graduate and Rhodes

 

scholar, Dr. Flournoy has a repu-
tation for being a thorough reader
of student essays.

Quite a few self-styled men of let-
ters in his courses have had their
pretensions demolished with a suc-
cinct “Pfu!” in the margins of their
papers.

Dr. Edward Turner of the physics
department is most widely known
for his teaching in the freshman
physics course. He has a _ patient
manner with freshmen who don’t
quite get the picture in physics but
is reluctant to give pat answers in
lectures or labs. The typical re-
sponse to a student asking if he
has the right figure in a lab ex-
periment is a quiet “Are you sat-
isfied?”

Another favorite phrase in de-
scribing some great experiment in
physics: “And lo and behold he
found that...”

No laboratory grind, Dr. Turner
takes an active interest in music and
drama.

Dr. Sidney Coulling, assistant pro-
fessor of English, is noted for his
highly-organized and _ stimulating
lectures—he has an uncanny knack
for making his students remember
what he says. Those students who
have had Dr. Coulling for either his
Victorian literature courses or the
advanced survey courses respect his
dedication and swear by his scholar-
ship.

His grading is scrupluously fair, but
demanding. He expects, and usually
gets, the most from his students.

Dr. Coulling is an alumnus of
W&L, and he has taken an active,
and perceptive, interest in the Uni-
versity. His editorial on the Honor
System which appeared this Fall in
the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi was a

definite analysis and re-affirmation
of Washington and Lee’s heritage.

Dean W. W. Pusey is known as
a very sound and fair teacher in
his elementary and _ intermediate
language courses. He manages to
sneak in a bit of dry wit to enliven
the classes from time to time.

Most students who have taken his
course in Goethe agree that it is
one of the best courses at W&L.

Dr. Milton Colvin, associate pro-
fessor of political science, has es-
tablished a reputation for brilliance
and depth in his first year at Wash-
ington and Lee. The student in his
classes gets the feeling that some
of this rubs off on him before the
end of the semester.

More than anything else, the con-
tact that a student can have with
the man is vital. He is a constant
source of guidance and encourage-

 

 

ment for those who seek it. For the

most part,

he allows his students

great width in their work in his

courses.

He is not the type of professor
that is buried in specifics. Rather,
he is concerned with the more gen-
eral things. He constantly strives to
tie together bits of knowledge that

students have learned

courses.

Craven Takes Seriously The Phrase ‘Leaving This School A Better Place Than You Found It’

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

As you all know today marks the
opening of the ceremonies, rites, and
rituals which signal the beginning.
It is traditional, I think, to spend
most of this time in praise of what-
ever school you happen to be leav-
ing. Everyone is in a good mood,

for exams are over, the summer is
ready, trips are to be taken, and
gin is cheap. Anyway there’s just no
cause to knock anything.

Far be it from me to knock any-
thing, either, just to be out of sorts
with the world. I’m in a good mood.
I’m graduating on Friday. 'm un-
employed, and I’ve got a rich, full

 

Honts Comments On Social And

Academic Changes, Improvements

By GEORGE HONTS

The year which we are closing
with this edition has seen seevr-
al significant changes in campus
life and has
heralded sev-
eral more to
come.

Those we
have’ seen
F would include
the irresponsi-
ble unbalanc-
ing of an al-
ready tilted
political situa-

3 tion; the grow-
Honts ing emphasis
on academics
(by both the Hill and the stu-
dents), to the emerging of the
IFC to the brink of the respon-
sible position it should have.

I’ve been hammering away at
the IFC for over a year now, and
the abolition of Hell Week and
the election of Ross Kyger as
president have been two moves
in the right direction.

   

Kyger’s selection of Tony
Schlesinger to head the con-
tinuing Rush Week Study Com-
mittee bears out his sincere
intention to provide the IFC
the best leadership it can find.
Hats off to Bob Doenges, and
maybe next year will be a
bright one.

Just as the face of the IFC
has changed, so is the face of the
University being altered.

The type of student that the
University has accepted for the
past two years has been vastly
different from the men who will
be graduating Friday or who
will graduate next June. In
turn, they are different from the
men who graduated three or
four years ago.

The change, be it for better
or worse, is toward the “seri-
ous” student. Men who should
know have told us that the man
with the best secondary school
marks will be getting the nod
over the high-schoolers and
prep schoolers who have less
adequate grades but who are
“well-rounded.”

Exactly what this change will
bring forth for W&L can not be
predicted. Either we shall sink
into a oblivious “happy medioc-
erity,” or we shall soar to new
heights and become “potted Ivy.”

But regardless of how we are

prone to look at the change,
everyone must admit that the
current administration is dedi-

cated to improving academic
standards, and, in doing so, has
guaranteed that W&L can offer
the college student an excellent
education.

* * %

As the student body is chang-
ing so is the faculty. This year
may well mark a definite altera-
tion of the face of the faculty.
Many men who have dedicated
very useful lives to the University
have retired, are retiring, or soon
will retire.

They are being replaced by
no less dedicated men, but men
who have an entirely different

outlook on what a_ college
should be—and what the posi-
tion of the student in that col-
lege should be.

Immense changes can be ex-
pected from the Hill—not over the
summer, maybe not next year—
but they shall come and com-
pletely alter the W&L we know
today. Once again it is difficult
to predict whether the change
will be for the better or worse—
perhaps it will depend on wheth-
er one is looking at it as a soph-
omore or as an alumnus.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

W&L’s Retiring Professors
Leave Excellent Records

During his 40-odd years on the fac-
ulty he has substituted for the Dean
of the University, the Dean of Stu-
dents, the Registrar and other uni-

Washington and Lee Professors William G. Bean and
Rupert N. Latture—both 70 years old and both a few days
away from retirement—had something in common before

they ever became faculty colleag

They were students under the*®
same college president, though at
different schools. Dr. George H.
Denny resigned the presidency of
Washington and Lee in 1912 during
the first semester of Prof. Latture’s
freshman year to head the Univer-
sity of Alabama where Dr. Bean was
a sophomore.

Since then, the two professors
have accumulated a combined total
of 82 years of active classroom teach-
ing at Washington and Lee. Liter-
ally hundreds of students have sat in
their classes since they began their
teaching careers in the early 1920's.
Dr. Bean has taught history since
1922 and Prof. Latture has been on
the political science faculty since
1920.

Both men will relinquish the heads
of their respective departments
when they step down Friday follow-
ing the university’s 213th commence-
ment.

While Prof. Latture remained at
Washington and Lee until 1916 to
obtain his M.A. degree, Dr. Bean
received his A.B. degree from Ala-
bama and went to Harvard Univer-
sity where he got his M.A. in 1916
and his Ph.D. in 1922.

Since coming to Washington and
Lee, the two professors have taught
under Presidents Henry L. Smith,
Robert H. Tucker, Francis P. Gaines
and Fred C. Cole. Both have risen
from assistant professor to professor
during their tenures.

Each of them has become a
familiar face to generations of
Washington and Lee students. Dr.
Bean has been known for his ex-
pertness in Civil War history and
Prof. Latture for his devotion to
freshman work, foreign students
and a number of student extra-
curricular organizations.

Retirement plans for the two are
tentative. Dr. Bean will continue to
teach two courses three days a
week while Prof. Latture will serve
as an adviser to the office of the
President.

Dr. Bean has a number of writ-
ing and traveling projects on his
schedule plus his garden to tend in
retirement. He married Lucy B.
Marsteller 35 years ago on May 28.
They have two sons.

An avid hiker by hobby, Dr. Bean
still will be seen on his familiar,
long walks with Dr. Ollinger Cren-
shaw, one of his freshman history
students in 1922 and the man who
succeeds him as head of the history
department. The two _ professors
spend a good part of their week-
ends strolling through the Lexing-
ton area countryside.

ues in Lexington 40 years ago.

cupation in retirement will be the
compilation of a complete history
and directory of Omicron Delta
Kappa, national honorary leader-
ship fraternity which he helped
found at Washington and Lee in
1914.

“That directory will take up a
great deal of my time,” Prof. Lat-
ture said, “but my wife and I plan
to be present for the many uni-
versity functions during the school
year.”

The Lattures—his wife is the
former Roberta Fulton—were mar-
ried July 28, 1917. They are faithful
participants in nearly every uni-
versity event. They have a son and
a daughter.

One aspect of teaching both of
the professors will not miss is the
grading of papers. They will be
happy to be relieved of that duty
so they can devote more time to
other work.

In 1959, Dr. Bean’s book, Stone-
wall’s Man: Sandie Pendleton, the
story of a young Washington Col-
lege graduate who served on the
staff of General Stonewall Jack-
son in the Civil War, was published.
He expects to have another book
ready shortly after he gives up
some of his teaching duties. Dr. Bean
is completing the final draft of a
volume about the Liberty Hall vol-
unteers, a group of Washington Col-
lege students who served with the
Stonewall Brigade in the Civil War.
He tentatively plans to title the
book “College Boys in Gray.”

An active member of the Execu-
tive Committee of the Virginia Civil
War Centennial Commission, Dr.
Bean also has contributed articles
to various historic journals and to
the Dictionary of American Biogra-
phy.

Dr. Bean feels the most significant
event in his teaching career has
been the development of a system
through which professors are given
grants for additional research and
study for books and articles as well
as class lectures.

One of the most beneficial pro-
grams for students at Washington
and Lee, Dr. Bean said, has been
the establishment of an honors
program. Candidates for honors
must prepare a thesis on a sub-
ject in their major field of study
before they can receive their de-
gree.

“It’s a little master’s program,”
Dr. Bean said about the program.
Prof. Latture has varied his teach-
ing career by aiding in a number of

ure pause and reflect on their

re this year, came to Washing-

years for the students who were not

 

 

versity officers. During World War
II, he was Dean of Students for two

in the armed forces.

He founded Washington and Lee’s
foreign students’ program in 1938
and continued as a loyal adviser
to foreign students until 1961. Each
September, his hand is extended to
welcome the new students and their
parents as they arrive at Washing-
ton and Lee’s Freshman Dormitory.
He is always on the platform for
the freshman orientation assemblies
which are held during the first two
months of each school year. Prof.
Latture constantly is a willing guide
for visitors to the university’s cam-
pus.

Prof. Latture’s name is synony-
mous with Omicron Delta Kappa on
the Washington and Lee Campus. He
has followed the organization from
its local origin with his fellow
classmates to its modern national
status. He also was one of the
founders of the modern-day uni-
versity chapter of Delta Upsilon so-
cial fraternity.

While Dr. Bean has lectured
throughout Virginia on the Civil
War, Prof. Latture has remained in
Lexington serving on the Rock-
bridge County Welfare Board and
the Board of Elders of the Presby-
terian Church. Each of them has
taken part in the activities of the
various academic organizations in
which they hold memberships.

Dr. Bean is a member of the
Southern and Virginia Historical
Associations, and Prof. Latture
holds memberships in the Ameri-
ean and Southern Political Science
Associations and the American
Sociology Society.

Both of the retiring professors are
Southerners, World War I veterans
and members of Phi Beta Kappa
and the Presbyterian Church. Dr.
Bean, a native of Heflin, Ala., served
as a lieutenant with American Ex-
peditionary Fores (AEF) in France.
In 1917-18, Prof. Latture, born near
