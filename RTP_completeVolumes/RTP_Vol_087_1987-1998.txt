W&L's chapter of Delta Tau Delta
has been put on a year’s social proba-
y tion by the Inter-Fraternity Council

judicial board in response to a sum-

ty for incoming freshmen, at which
minors were served alcohol.

« While driving home from the party

and remains in a coma.
® Delta Tau Deita, under the social

probation, will not be permitted to
hold any social functions for the

Farley, summer rush parties are

‘governed by the same rules that

Orientation brings new activities

The 1987-88 academic year began
“ with a week devoted to Freshman
» Orientation. This year’s orientation
. schedule differed from that of
* previous years, in that there were
» More social activities and up-
perclassmen were more involved in

University President John Wilson

' “TI think those kinds of activities

meet other freshmen in a very effec-
tive way,” said Ruscio.

Farley said that Cole was invited to
a party held by Delta Tau Delta in
Potomac, Md., at the home of the
parents of two Delt alumni, David
Blackwood, Class of *80, and Michael
Blackwood, ’87.

Cole, 18, was served alcohol at the
party, said Farley. This, according to
Farley, was not necessarily in viola-
tion of IFC regulations.

‘In this case,’’ said Farley, ‘‘serv-
ing alcohol was not necessarily
against IFC policy, although there
were certain requirements that they
had to fulfill.”

“That would include providing a
bartender who’s over 21, providing
sober transportation if necessary,
not serving intoxicated people. Pret-
ty much the guidelines as they're set
forth in the [IFC] Constitution.”
Farley indicated that Delt had
followed all of these policies at the
party.

At about 11 p.m., one-half hour
after Delt had stopped serving
alcohol, Cole left the party with two

freshmen can come together as a
class in something other than the
placement tests.

“The Alumni Association, their
philosophy is that from the moment
you set foot on this campus, you are
an alumnus. So, this is a way of in-
troducing the students to each other
as the newest alumni of Washington
and Lee.”

There are no definite plans for
changes in next year’s orientation,
but there are ideas to make it
shorter.

“I think we’d do a better job in less
time ... In order to do that, I think
there would have to be some changes
in what we actually do. It’s not a mat-
ter of taking everything that we do
and putting it into a shorter amound’
of time,” said Ruscio.

‘The freshmen are just anxious to
get going, and the main thing they
wanted to do was get in, take some
classes, and get moving.
~“Miy impresstun is that this is a
very outgoing, friendly, interesting
freshman class. They showed last
week that they are eager to join in,
eager to get on with college.

“There is a student group this year
which, for the first time, came up
with some ideas for improving orien-
tation...and that’s something I would
definitely like to continue. I would
love to have students more involved
in some of the activites. I think this
year showed them that good things
can happen.”’

other freshmen. Cole did appear to be
intoxicated when he left the party.
However, the driver of the car was
sober, said Farley.

The group returned to the party at
about 12:30 am. Farley said that they
had had alcohol, not previded by the
Delts, during the hour-and-a-half
they had been away.

Cole went inside the Blackwood’s
home to use the bathroom after ap-
parently trying to get a ride home
with a freshman woman who had also
been at the party. The woman, who
was sober, asked Delt President
Kevin Webb to prevent Cole from get-
ting in her car with her. However,
when Cole came out of the house, he
went right past Webb and got into the
car with the woman, according to
Farley. Webb, said Farley, then went
back into the house, leaving Cole in
the car with the woman.

“In the IFC’s mind,” said Farley,
“there was a breakdown of respon-
sibility at that moment. Up to that

In addition to changes in the orien-
tation schedule, this was also the first
year that women had specific ac-
tivities to do during Fraternity Rush.

Julie Sheppard, Vice-President
and Treasurer of Trident, formerly
the Women’s Forum, explained that
activities for the freshmen women
were planned for each of the three
nights that the men had open houses
for the fraternities.

On Tuesday there was an ice
cream social hosted by all of the
female faculty and administration.
Wednesday night after the barbeque
there was a Women’s Orientation in
the Moot Courtroom. Thursday night
was the Big Sister/Little Sister din-
ner and meeting.

“T think the ice cream social that
the faculty and administrators did
worked out really well...and there
were quite a few at the orientation on
Wednesday night,” safd Sheppard.

The women’s orientation was at-
tended by both freshmen and up-
perclass women. It served to explain
the role that women play at
Washington and Lee and to answer
any questions that women on campus
might have had.

“T think it was a good start to the
year just for the upperclassmen to
have a chance to meet the freshmen
and to familiarize themselves with

point, Delta Tau Delta was making
every attempt to control the party.”’

About 10 minutes later, the woman
got Cole out of her car and left. Cole
then got into his car and was on his
way home when the accident oc-
cured.

According to Dean of Freshmen
Kenneth Ruscio, Cole’s car veered
across the center line into the path of
an oncoming tractor trailer. The car
swung sideways and the tractor
trailer hit the car on the driver’s side.

The impact knocked Cole to the
passenger side of the car, causing ex-
tensive injuries to his pelvis, legs,
and head.

Cole remains on a respirator and in
a coma at Suburban Hospital in
Olney, Md.

Delt President Webb declined to
speak about the incident on advice of
counsel.

Associate Dean of Students Leroy
C. ““Buddy”’ Atkins said that a lawyer
representing Cole’s father has con-

tacted him for preliminary informa-
tion, but Atkins has not been able to
get back in touch with him.

Delta Tau Delta’s faculty advisor,
Burr Datz, said to his knowledge, the
fraternity had not yet been contacted
by a lawyer for Cole.

Datz said, ‘In terms of violation,
we broke the rules, we will take our
medicine.

“What it comes down to is that we
will have to become a_ service-
oriented fraterntiy for a year.”’

Right now, according to Webb, the
Delts have a tentative plan in mind to
begin an alcohol awareness pro-
gram.

Webb said that their national head-
quarters has sent a representative to
advise them on this program. Webb
said he plans to develop a program,
in cooperation with the Virginia
Alcoholic Beverage Control and the
University, on alcohol awareness and

 

 

risk management for fraternities. He

freshmen during the student activities fair.

also said Atkins had suggested that
they also take the program to high
schools and junior high schools.

“T think it will have an impact,”
said Webb, “because it will be
students doing the presentation and
not the police or the ABC.

“We'd like people to know we're a
good house and we're going to stay
that way.”’

Datz said, “I don’t foresee us hav-
ing any financial problems this year
(since Delt will have no pledge
class).”’

The pledge dues for Delta Tau
Delta are $75 a month, said Datz. He
estimates that with an average
pledge class of 15, Delt will lose $1,125
per month. He feels the house can ab-
sorb this loss.

“All members will have to live in
the house. As long as there is rent,
the corporation can take care of pro-
perty, taxes, insurance’ and other
needs, said Datz.

number of rush offenses against the
house. If a house receives three rush
violations then they have their rush
privileges suspended for one year.

Also hit hard was Kappa Sigma.
They were fined $500 for allowing
brothers to have hard liquor at one of
their rush parties. Kappa Sigma
president David Collerain said that
he thought the rule banning hard
alcohol was unclear. ‘‘We thought it
was a grey area. It seemed more of a
guideline thana rule.”

However, Kappa Alpha president
Jay Markley, whose house was fined
for a similar violation, said he
“thought the rule was clear.”’

freshmen dorms. Unlike previous
years, when parties could be easily
found in the dormitories, this year
the sight of a beer in the halls is not
as common. Also different is that one
may need a pass key in order to gain
admission to a certain hallway.
These new rules have been a popular
subject of many conversations.

The freshmen response to the
alcohol policy has been negative. One
freshman claimed he wants a place
to relax and drink. Since contact with
the fraternities is limited, freshmen
want todrink in the dorms.

However, this can result in serious
consequences. The first time a dorm
counselor finds a student possessing
alcohol, the alcohol will be con
fiscated and the student will be
assigned labor hours when he or she
must complete a task, such as clean-
ing the library. In addition, Jay
Gorlowski, head dorm counselor, will
record all violations in a student file
Subsequent violations of the policy
will result in more drastic punish-
ments and the student will be refer
red to the dean of freshmen who will
decide how to resolve the problem

 

Kappa Sigma was also cited for a
non-rush offense in that they made
alcohol the theme of one of their par-
ties. The party has not yet taken
place but was on a schedule printed
by the fraternity. For that second of-
fense the fraternity was put on a
month of conduct probation beginn-
ing immediately and a week of social
probation beginning on Sept. 22.

When a house is on conduct proba-
tion, according to Atkins, any viola-
tion of any type, no matter how
minor, will result in social probation
for the entire fraternity.

In addition to Kappa Sigma and
Kappa Alpha, the following houses

This new, stricter policy was
brought on by many factors. One
main reason is that no Washington
and Lee freshman is of legal drinking
age in the state of Virginia. As Dean
of Freshmen Kenneth Ruscio points
out, ‘‘As an institution in Virginia we
must abide by the rules imposed by
the state. Although we want the
dorms to be an enjoyable place to
live, if we don’t enforce the law, it
will be enforced for us.” This self-
governing protects the student from
police raids since, if the policy is
followed, there will be no need for
police involvement.

Another reason for establishing the
policy is to provide the freshmen a
clear understanding of the universi-
ty’s view on drinking. Moose Herr-

ing, an assistant head counselor ex-
plains, “The difference [from last
year* is that last year the punish-
ment for alcohol was left to the
diseretion of the dorm counselors.”
This resulted in inconsistencies in the
punishments for violations, These in-
consistencies were unfair since the
same violations would receive dif-

ferent punishments according to
what dorm counselor controlled the
hall. Now the dorm counselor has no
choice but to report the violations
since Gorlowski adamantly warns

were also fined $500 for allowing hard
liquor at their parties: Beta Theta Pi,
Chi Psi, Pi Kappa Phi, and Sigma Phi
Epsilon. Sigma Alpha Epsilon was
fined $500 for a contact violation. It
was the first rush offense for all the
fraternities involved.

According to Atkins, all the
penalties were approved by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee and are
final. There was one appeal, but it
was denied.

Preceding last night’s Judicial
Board meeting was the weekly IFC
meeting.

At the invitation of the IFC, Special
Agent Stevens of the Virginia Alcohol

not reporting a violation, that
counselor will be fired immediate-

Less of a controversy are the new
security measures. In Graham-Lees,
Gilliam, and Davis, the female

Beverage Control addressed the
meeting on the ABC’s plans for enfor-
cing Virginia’s alcohol laws this
year.

Stevens admitted that it was im-
possible to stop underage drinking by
college students and that, provided
the fraternities follow the IFC’s
guidelines for safe partying, there
should be no problems.

He continued, however, to say if a
fraternity is having an open party
then ABC agents have every right to
attempt to enter that party. Once in-
side, said Stevens, the agents could

arrest people for violations of
Virginia law.

Stevens concluded by saying that

hallways are locked at midnight and
the residents of the halls are given
pass keys. Plans to install locks in
Baker are underway. This security
was added after there were a few in-
cidents involving people outside the
university entering the women’s

Chief of Police Bruce Beard and the
Lexington police would cooperate ful-
ly on all these policies.

Also discussed at last night’s
meeting was a preliminary plan to
delay pledge programs for three
weeks in order to hold three seminars
for the benefit of the freshmen.

IFC president Mark Farley said he
had three programs in mind; one on
Alcohol Awareness, one on the IFC
constitution, and one on hazing. This
plan, however, is very preliminary
and Farley said that he and Atkins
would try to develop a formal pro-
gram to present to the fraternities at
next week’s meeting.

Gaines Hall is still in progress

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

Each morning, the sounds of saws,
hammers, and industrial equipment
working on the $8.1 million new
residence hall greet the residents of
Gaines as well as those of Gilliam
and Davis.

“Tt was much worse last year,”
noted fourth floor Gilliam Dorm
Counselor Dee Dee Truett. The new
dorm was scheduled to be completed
on July 31.

Weather conditions hampered the
construction of Gaines. The
temperature was too hot and rainy in
the summer and too cold in the
winter. Also, the gatehouse, which
will connect the wings of the dorm,
proved to be more complicated to

eae ss

build than was originally thought.

The gatehouse remains incomplete
as does the landscaping for the dorm
quad. Gaines residents are still in-
convenienced by construction work-
ers in the halls and outside the win-
dows.

Three weeks before school started,
the rooms had not been completed,
but by Sept. 1, the resident assistants
were able to move in. The rest of the
students moved in Labor Day week-
end or during the week before classes
started.

Currently, 195 students reside at
Gaines. The 114 females and 81 males
consist of 174 upperclassmen, 14 law
students, and 7 freshmen. Originally,
the dorm was to be for upperclass-
men only, but law students were
allowed to live at the new dorm to
help defray the cost of building the

dorm. Over-confirmation of fresh-
man rooms resulted in the assign-
ment of freshmen to the dorm. Room
for 53 more students exists.

Space at the Woods Creek apart-
ments is also available. Only 121 peo-
ple out of 178 possible occupants live
at the apartments. The reason space
is available ‘-z-oincides with one of
the reasons thew dorm was built.
According to Fri% Parsons, assis-
tant to the president, the population
of students at Washington and Lee is
expected to undergo ‘‘modest
growth.’’ The space is available to
accommodate the population in-
creases from approximately 1,350 to
1,500.

OPINION
Changes

A number of people have expressed displeasure with this
year’s revised Rush, both verbally and on the backs of T-
shirts. However, people should look closely at the new rules
and see what the Interfraternity Council is trying to accom-

 

plish.

The shortened time period keeps Rush from interfering
with students’ academic loads. This benefits freshmen and
fraternity men alike. Having the majority of Rush functions
over before class starts allows everyone to concentrate on
what they are here for in the first place: academics.

Limiting freshmen to only one night of fraternity parties
(not including the ones at which they can accept their bids)
admittedly puts the houses under a lot of pressure, but it does
take some of the emphasis off the social aspects of the house.
Freshmen who make their decision solely on the basis of how
wild a fraternity parties may be sorely disappointed after

they join.

Fraternities are being pushed back to what they originally
were: groups of men who lived, and worked together in a

spirit of brotherhood.

Unfortunately,

fraternities at

Washignton and Lee over the years have put an undue em-
phasis on parties. Hopefully that will begin to change.

There is one very valid complaint this year, however. Forc-
ing freshmen to sign up for open houses before having any
contact with fraternities except for the Rush book (and the
almost inevitable dirty Rush), hurts both the freshmen and

the smaller houses.

Perhaps setting up a type of fraternity forum, where each
fraternity has a chance to make a presentation and meet the
incoming freshmen, would help the situation. It would only
set the beginning of Rush back by, one or two days, which
would preserve the valuable changes that have been made.

W&L needs a fall Rush that works, to avoid having Rush
pushed back into the winter term. If the fraternities will work
together through the IFC, this will be accomplished. Other-
wise, the fraternity system will weaken, maybe never to

recover.

Students and trash
arrive in Lexington

 

MY VIEW
By Margaret Pimblett

 

Saturday, Sept. 5, 8:56 a.m.

I was already running late for work
when I began walking down Washing-
ton Street, from its intersection with
Estill Street, toward the Stonewall
Jackson House at 8 E. Washington.

I’d made that walk nearly every
day this summer. For three months I
have lived in Lexington as a city resi-
dent, not as a Washington and Lee
University student.

Many signs had already appeared
which indicated that the summer was
drawing to a close. The Virginia
Military Institute cadets had been in
town for well over two weeks, and the
Washington and Lee law students for
just as long. The U-Haul drop-off
point on the way to Kroger’s seemed
to have twice as many trailers as
usual, and I saw more out-of-state
license places with ‘‘Washington and
Lee”’ stickers in car windows.

Yes, the masses were returning.
Fraternity members had returned to
spruce up the houses and prepare for
rush. Many students wanted to get an
early start on fixing up new apart-
ments. And some just wanted to
spend some time in town with friends
and without the hassles of classes
and school-year activities.

I needed to continue my summer
schedule for only one more day. I
would be moving the last of my
things from my apartment into
Gaines Hall’ that Saturday evening.
That morning was the last time I
would make that same walk along
Washington Street. During the three
months’ worth of walks which I had
made, I had seen an occasional emp-
ty drink can or McDonald’s bag along
those four blocks. I usually picked up
the litter that I saw, and tossed it into
the garbage can in front of the Lex-
ington Visitor’s Center.

This particular Saturday morning,
I picked up ten plastic throw-away
cups, the type used for keg parties or
picnics.

I didn’t have time to pick up the
beer bottles, the paper bags, the
styrofoam cups, and the other trash
that lay on the sidewalks, in the
street, and in the yards of the four
houses along that side of the road.
After all, [hada job to attend to.

I work weekends as a tour guide at
the Jackson House, meeting people
who come to Lexington for any of a
number of reasons.

An interest in Civil War history.
The desire to see the Shenandoah
Valley and the Blue Ridge Moun-
tains. An appointment to visit W&L
or VMI to see the campus and be in-
terviewed for admission. The search
for a vacation which was restful and
soothing, not hectic and nerve-
racking. For all of these reasons, and
many more, Lexington attracts
visitors throughout the year, but par-
ticularly in the peak travel months of
the summer. _ es

And almost’ all of the ‘summer
visitors whom I met and had the
chance to talk to had the same im-
pression.

“Lexington is such a beautiful
town,” they would say. ““You must
really enjoy living here.”

Well, I do enjoy it, even if lama
transplant and not a native.

But during the summer I met a
town with a completely different per-
sonality than the one I knew from
September until June.

The town I met prided itself on its
appearance to visitors, its clean city
streets, its quaint 19th century
facades, and its personable resi-
dents.

It promoted its professional
theatre companies, its restored inns,
even its homemade ice cream.

And it never had to apologize for
any litter problems.

But when the students return, and
the population is doubled, and the
partying begins, the garbage piles
up.

And the town is noisier, and the
parking spaces are more limited, and
more people walk down the street
without a word of greeting to the
folks they pass by.

As another W&L student said, “‘No
wonder the townspeople hate us.”’

I’m amazed that we don’t hear
more griping from Lexington citi-
zens.

They do have good reason to resent
our presence, but they’re also in-
telligent enough to realize the
positive impact that students have on
this town, particularly on the
economic development of the area.

But we as students must realize the
responsibility we have as residents of
this city. That means respecting the
community leaders and officials, be-
ing friendly to our neighbors, and
bearing with the problems inherent
in the situation of a college town.

And it means throwing away your
debris in a trash can. Just look for the
quaint, 19th century-type barrels on
the city streets.

Lexington even makes its garbage
attractive.

Frosh should have more contact

 

MY VIEW
By Laura Dodge

 

As a freshman, entering
Washington and Lee after visiting on-
ly once was a confusing experience.
Fortunately, I had all of Orientation
Week to begin to understand what I
consider to be the most involved
event of the first two weeks—Rush.
After being here only a few days, I
found all the freshmen diving into the
Rush events. Although these social
events are both fun and exciting, I
believe that their timing and the
short-term dates make Rush an un-
necessarily confusing occurence.

Since most men seem to under-
stand the rules of Rush, their confu-
sion may stem only from the pres-
sure of choosing a fraternity in the
short time allotted to decide. They
have 11 chances to meet some of the
seventeen fraternities. They have an
hour and a half to make a good first
impression, and are hopefully invited
back to make a second one. For-
tunately, most men seem to know the
fraternity houses where they feel
most comfortable. However I ques-
tion the ability to make a good deci-
sion under the pressure of making
good impressions and abiding to the
time allotted for Rush dates.

Of course, freshmen, as a whole,
are excited enough to be in college
that they don’t worry too much about
the confusion of rush dates, open

Washington and Lee has in the
past enjoyed the financial support
of many private foundations.
While foundation grants help the
University pay its bills, they as
importantly enable faculty
members to initiate new
academic programs and em-
phasis which, if successful,
become permanent parts of the
curriculum. In this way, private
foundations play a significant role
in the continuing evolution of our
curriculum. In the past three
years, Washington and Lee has
been very fortunate in receiving
five curriculum and faculty
strengthening grants from four
foundations.

The Andrew W. Mellon Founda-
tion’s most recent grant in 1985
was awarded in support of (1) our
East Asian Studies Program and
(2) a newly developing Cognitive
Studies Program. Funds from this
grant made it possible to employ
Michael Smitka, a specialist in
East Asian economic systems. He
received an appointment in the
department of Economics in 1986
and has already developed two
new courses on Japan and
China’s modern economies
(Economics 385 and 386). This
grant also makes it possible for
members of our East Asian
Studies faculty to travel and study
in Japan and China. Anne Rogers,
Roger Jeans, and Harold Hill
have already traveled and studied
under the auspices of this grant
and others will do'so in years to
come. Japanese and Chinese
scholars and artists are now
visiting our campus every year.

Contact” rules. During the two weeks
of Rush the new freshmen class is
segregated from the rest of the
school. Orientation week unites the
freshmen class, but the length of
Rush and the shortness of Rush

FROM THE HILL

Liang Heng (an authority on the
cultural revolution); John W.
Watt (Columbia University);
Masao Abe (Nara University,
Japan); Wei-Ming Tu (Harvard
University), and Michio
Tukunaga (Kyoto Women’s
University, Japan) have lectured
to university audiences and
visited our classes.

Visiting performing artists in-
cluding Koto Okamoto, Brian
Silver (sitarist), and the Tsuxma
Noh Instrumental and Dance
Group have performed here in the
last two years, helping us to better
understand Japanese music and
culture.

Our new Cognitive Studies Pro-
gram is completely funded by the
Mellon Foundation grant. This in-
terdisciplinary program brings
together faculty from the Depart-
ments of Computer Science,
Philosophy, and Psychology to ex-
plore answers to questions such as
the following: ‘In what ways are
computers and computer lan-
guages like humans and their
languages?” ‘‘What would it take
to build a computer that thinks or
that could understand, and com-
municate in a human language
like English?”’ These, and com-
parable questions, will be the
focus of a core of courses both
drawn from these departments
and newly created for this pro-
gram. (See pp. 81-2, 1987-88
catalogue.) Grants funds have
been used to increase our library
holdings (both journals and
books), to support faculty who are
developing new courses in this
field, to bring to campus
specialists in cognitive science to
lecture and consult with those
responsible for developing the
program. This past summer the
grant provided the funds for
David Elmes, Ken Lambert,
Harry Pemberton, and Joe
Thompson to attend Stanford

University’s four week
Linguistics Institute. Ramsey
Martin spent last Winter Term at
the Institute for Cognitive Science
at the University of Colorado. Asa
result of these concentrated
periods of study by members of
the faculty, many of the pro-
gram’s course offerings will be
revised and expanded.

One of Washington’s and Lee’s
most recent grants has been
awarded by the Pew Memorial
Trust. With this grant, members
of our language faculty are in-
troducing computer aided instruc-
tional exercises into the elemen-
tary and intermediate Japanese,
Chinese, Russian, Latin, Greek,
French, Spanish, and German
language courses. This past sum-
mer, Edward Hamer, Russell
Knudson, Kathy Koberstein,
Greta McCaughrin, James
Williams, and Herman Taylor
received Pew grants to write addi-
tional software programs to ex-
pand computer exercises and
testing in these languages. Harold
Hill spent time in Taiwain
familiarizing himself with

‘ Chinese computer systems in
order to learn how to write soft-
ware for his Chinese language
courses. Ten additional DEC ter-
minals have been placed in the
library, fourteen in the Computer
Center, and four in the language
lab to accommodate students do-
ing these exercises. A new Tand-
berg IS-10 language lab was in-
stalled last January to replace the
old Telex lab. Vikki Shelor has
been employed to direct the lab;
she is also responsible for new
audio/visual equipment in the lab
and five of the language class-
rooms,

This Pew grant will also be used
to support faculty members who
will develop new literature and
culture courses in the language
department. This past summer,

i

for example, John Lambeth spent
time at the Cinematheque de
Paris and the Georges Pompidou
Center and Multi-Media Library
to gather material for developing Ff
a new course in the New Wave
Cinema movement in France.
These funds will also be used to
support visiting lecturers like
Spanish novelist Carmen Laforet |}
who visited Washington and Lee
last March. The grant will support I
the language departments’ Native
Assistant Program which brings
native speakers to campus for the |
Winter Term each year to help |,
prepare students for their Spring
Term Abroad. Students with |
financial need will also be sup-
ported by this grant in covering
the costs of six week study abroad
experience in the spring.

In 1985, the Dana Foundation
awarded the University a grant to
hire three new faculty members
in physics-engineering, computer
science, and mathematics. This
grant enabled us to employ new
faculty members in areas where
they were needed to meet rising
enrollments. Kenneth Van Ness
(Department of Physics-
Engineering); Kenneth Lambert
(Department of Computer
Science); and Paul Bourdon
(Department of Mathematics
—will join the faculty in 1988-89)
will be known as Dana Fellows.

Finally, our need to purchase
new scientific equipment for our
instructional and research labs is
being partially met by scientific
equipment grants from the Pew
Memorial Trust and the DuPont
Foundation. Many pieces of essen-

tial scientific equipment have | +

very short shelf lives and are also
extremely expensive. Our new
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Spectrometer and _ Liquid
Chromatograph — both recently
purchased with these grant funds
— are examples.

women’s activities at W&L,’’ con-
cluded Sheppard.

Freshman response to the orienta-
tion week and the women’s orienta-
tion seemed very enthusiastic.

“It was like summer camp,”’ sum-
marized freshman Blair Simmons.
You don’t have to do any work, you
just go to meetings, and you...meet
all these people.

“T think the week was great, I wish
that we were still in orientation! The
mandatory meetings were a little
long, and they were at eight o’clock
in the morning, and it’s hard to sit
and listen to a speech in an uncomfor-
table chair at eight in the morning. If
they planned them to be shorter and
at better times, I think that the turn-
out would’ve been a little better at

the end of the week,”’ said Simmons.

The general consensus among the
freshmen was that many of the
meetings were too early or even
unimportant.

“A lot of the stuff...I sat through
and sort of wondered why I was
there. A lot...in Lee Chapel didn’t
seem that necessary, sort of too long.
They could have said it a lot
shorter,’’ commented freshman
Mike Badger.

“The more important speeches
were at the end of the week, and a lot
of people just said, ‘forget it,’
because they were sick of getting up
early in the morning. Maybe...they
could move the speeches back even
an hour,” said freshman Mike
Moseman,

Overall, the comments about the
orientation week were very positive
and indicate that it was once again a
success.

W&L summer
programs successful

 

From Staff Reports

 

Although Washington and Lee
University does not have an official
summer school, there has been no
shortage of students of all ages on
campus this summer.

Washington and Lee’s Office of
Summer Programs enjoyed record
and near-record attendance at many
of the programs this summer. The
first Institute for Family Business,
an innovative program that ex-
amines the opportunities and pro-
blems unique to family-owned
businesses, drew 37 participants
from 20 companies to the five-day
program.

Robert P. Fure, director of Sum-
mer Programs at Washington and
Lee, said the Institute for Family
Business “exceeded all expecta-
tions.”

“Our goal is to serve 20 companies
annually,’’ Fure said. ‘‘We are seek-
ing multi-generational representa-
tion—fathers and sons, husbands and
wives, brothers, and other combi-
nations—to study the issues, such as
succession planning, that are unique
to family businesses.”’

More than 350 high school students
applied for admission to the Summer
Scholars program. In its .seventh
year, Summer Scholars brought
students from all over the country to
the W&L campus in July for a month
long program of college-level studies
for students between their junior and
senior years in high school. One hun-
dred and thirty-two students
representing 30 states, Canada, and
Puerto Rico were selected for the
program.

“The Summer Scholars program is
now nationally recognized,” Fure
said. “The program enjoys a solid
reputation for its academics and pre-
college counseling. Also, our optional
pre-professional curricula give high
school students an unusual first-hand
look at the fields many of them are
considering.”

Fure announced that James D.
Farrar Sr., former director of alumni
admissions at Washington and Lee,
has been named associate director of
Summer Programs and director of
admissions for Summer Scholars.
Farrar will also supervise marketing
for the Institute for Family Business
and the W&L Institute for Ex-
ecutives.

the Housing surveys administered
during matriculation last year and
the advent of women on campus
three years ago. The survey results
indicated that approximately 100
students were dissatisifed with their
living conditions off campus. Fur-
thermore, women do not wish to live
off campus in more remote places
such as old farm houses. They also do
not have alternative housing such as
fraternity houses.

The many pluses to living in Gaines
are the newness of the facilities, the
weight room with nautilus equip-
ment, the computer room, and the
new laundry room where a load of
wash costs only 50 cents as compared
to 75 cents in Graham-Lees. The

gatehouse will be used as a meeting
room, party room, and lecture hall.
The resident assistants at Gaines
plan to make the dorm a community
by hosting parties for Gaines Hall
Residents only, as well as holding
parties which are open to others. The
R.A.’s wish to create social activities
during times when fraternity life
may be a little slow. They are ‘‘not
trying to become a replacement for

fraternities or an independent
center,” emphasizes head R.A.
Marie Dunne.

A few problems have cropped up
because the dorm was completed in
such a rush. First, two rooms adja-
cent to the gatehouse leaked due to a
temporary roof. Those rooms have
been cleaned and fixed and should be
ready for occupancy soon. Second,
the air conditioner is not working
very well. The halls are cool but
some of the students’ rooms are quite

warm. Third, a few of the toilets are
clogged. This stoppage is probably
due to the fact that the toilets are
residential as opposed to industrial
style.

Alcohol is permitted in Gaines;
however, the consumer must be 21
years of age. Kegs are not allowed,
and drinking must be confined to the
suites. The resident assistants must
enforce these rules as well as other
disciplinary rules. Dunne clarifies
that the R.As “are not dorm
counselors or policemen, but they
- make sure the rules are follow-

The dorm has 3 wings, A, B, and C.
The suites are basically set up as two
bedrooms with a lounge and bath-
room connecting the two. Approx-
imately one half of the bedrooms are
doubles and one half are singles.

Parking poses a problem at the
new dorm. Students are parking out-

side by the curb and getting ticketed.
The curb lacks a yellow line, but is
still a restricted area. Parsons
Stresses the fact that Gaines
residents should only park in those
areas marked G on the parking map.
“We are going to carry out enforce-
ment of the parking regulations quite
rigorously,’’ he warns. Enforcement
includes enlisting the aid of the local
police. Fourty spots are located in
the Gaines parking lot, with spill over
lots behind the gym and near the
train depot.

Right now, Gaines provides a
closer and newer location for
students in a housing crunch. Student
athletes, such as junior soccer plav-r
Tracy Williams, are able to make it
to classes and practices easier.
Gaines is also a reminder that the
faculty and the housing department
are willing to meet the students’
needs.

Lisa Alty

 

By Courtney Harpold
Staff Reporter

 

The newest member of the
chemistry department is a woman.

Lisa Alty, a doctoral candidate in
the School of Pharmacy at Virginia
Commonwealth University, has been
hired to teach primarily medicinal
and biochemistry. She is currently
teaching Modern Analytical Chem-
istry (Chem. 313), one quiz section of
General Chemistry (Chem. 101) and
one lab of Organic Chemistry (Chem.
241).

During the winter she'll teach
medicinal chemistry, and in the
spring she plans to teach
Biochemistry (Chem. 244). She also
would like to begin research on the
synthesis and evaluation of potential
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
agents.

Alty is a native of Lynchburg and a
1982 graduate of the College of
William & Mary with a B.S. in
chemistry. She intends to complete
her doctorate in medicinal chemistry
in December.

She has been married for four
years to her “high school sweet-
heart,’’ who is now a surgical resi-
dent at MCV and who still lives in
Richmond. Although she doesn’t en-
joy the arrangement, Alty stays in
Lexington Monday through Thursday
and returns home on the weekends.
As a change from her job as a scien-
tist, she enjoys sewing and knitting
“‘a lot of things housewives like to
do.”

The first and only woman in the
chemistry department, Alty talked
about the adjustments. “Any woman
in the hardcore sciences will find out
when she becomes a professional,
she’ll probably be the only woman
there. [It’s] something I knew I
would have to expect sooner or
later.” She emphasized, however,
that ‘“‘everybody has been terrific... I
don’t feel like the only woman.”

Kathleen Olson

SAO RRNA ST LTTE I

By Alisann McGloin
Staff Reporter

 

In addition to the freshman class,
this year there are some other new
faces on the Washington and Lee
campus. Kathleen Olson, a new pro-
fessor in the fine arts department
came to W&L after teaching at
McNeese State University from 1983
until 1987.

Olson is anxiously awaiting the
commencement of classes and is
looking forward to working with
students enrolled in the studio art
courses which she will be teaching.
She is very excited about the changes
which she will be instituting. One
aspect of the art department which
students may find a little different is
her own teaching technique. Olson
will concentrate on teaching the
basic fundamentals of art and each
student will work on similar assign-
ments. Olson feels the students will
benefit to a greater extent if they are
in the classroom at the scheduled
time working on an assigned project.

“My own painting is my greatest
interest,’ says Olson. Olson has even
turned her own office into a studio in
which she can paint on her own.

Not only is Olson a new professor at
W&L, but she is also the new director
of the duPont Art Galley. And Olson
encourages ‘“‘everyone to come to the
receptions” at the gallery.

Neville Richardson

By Andy Nixon
Staff Reporter

 

R. Neville Richardson, who taught
at Washington and Lee in 1985, now
returns to W&L as the Howerton
Visiting Professor of Religion.

Richardson has a B.S. from the
University of Natal, (Pietermaritz-
burg, South Africa) a B.D. from
Rhodes University, and a M. Phil.
from Oxford.

Richardson says he utilized his
religious training by both serving in
the parish ministry and teaching at
the University of Natal. Richardson
then shifted from the parish ministry
to the academic fields of religion by
becoming an appointed lecturer in
1981. Now the professor teaches one
introductory religion course and
several advanced courses primarily
dealing with theological ethics and
race relations.

Richardson says he enjoys several
activities outside the classroom, He
has a wife as well as children of ages
twelve, eleven, nine, and eight. He
snjoys squash and soccer, and plans
yn coaching a fourth and fifth grade

yoys soccer team. Richardson also is
involved with the Methodist church
here in Lexington.

Richardson says he finds Washing-
on and Lee to be a ‘‘fantastic place”
ind feels ‘fortunate to be here.”

Staff Reporter

Professor David W. Wiest, who
taught at Washington and Lee from
1981 to 1984, is returning for one year
as an instructor of accounting.

Wiest received a B.A. in 1975 from
Williams College and a M.A. in 1981
from the University of Virginia. He is
currently working on his doctorate at
the University of North Carolina.

Wiest lives in Chapel Hill, North
Carolina and commutes to Lex-
ington. He is currently single and,
when time allows, he enjoys hiking
and reading.

He will teach two sections of Acct.
201 and one section of Acct. 214.

Because W&L’s semesters are
three weeks shorter than at Universi-
ty of North Carolina, Wiest says he
will spend “‘less time on details, more
time on concepts.”’

Wiest says he is glad to be back at
W&L, one reason being small class
sizes. “It makes a big difference.
There’s a more personal feeling. It’s
easier to get the discussion going.”’

Wiest admits he does not yet have a
feel for the new W&L student, but
does suggest that they “‘spend time
on the academic activities as well.”

Christopher Comuto

By David Bekenstein
Staff Reporter

 

Christopher A. Comuto, instructor
of English, will be replacing Pro-
fessor James Boatwright who is on
leave this semester. Comuto holds a
B.A. degree from Colgate University
(1973) anda M.A. in English from the
University of Virginia, where he is a
candidate for a Ph.D. in Modern
Literature. This fall Comuto will be
teaching two writing courses and one
literature course, the 225 survey
covering early American literature.
Although he feels the course is
somewhat limited by curriculum, the
sections concerning the political
writers Jefferson Payne and James
Madison will be particularly in-
teresting in this year of the Constitu-
tion’s Bicentennial.

Outside the classroom, Camuto is a
self-proclaimed outdoorsman who is
a “fanatic for trout fishing.’ His
commitment to the outdoors led him
to help the UVA Environmental
Science Department study the effect
of acid rain, as well as serve on the
Virginia Wilderness Committee.
Camuto has also had some of his
journalistic articles published in
magazines such as Sierra and
Virginia Wildlife.

Camuto “‘loves the setting of W&L”’
and says he’s “rapidly becoming a
small town Virginian.” His early im-
pressions of W&L are influenced by
tbe ‘‘openness and friendliness of the
W&L community.’ In all, he is look-
ing forward to this year.

Joining Washington and Lee
University’s faculty this fall is Cecile
West-Settle, assistant professor of
romance languages. West-Settle
moved from the staff of Virginia
Military Institute, where she has
served since 1981. She explains her
primary reason for the change as a
result of her desire ‘‘to work in a co-
ed environment.”

West-Settle will be teaching 3
levels of Spanish this term: Elemen-
tary Spanish, Intensive Spanish
Review, and Advanced Spanish Con-
versation and Composition. She ex-
plains her course philosophy as stem-
ming from her own “personal ex-
perience as a language major in a
traditional environment,” in which
students did not actually spend much
time speaking the language in class.
She stresses that it is “very impor-
tant to use spoken language from the
first day, putting aside prior inhibi-
tions.”’

West-Settle is currently devoting
the majority of her time spent out-
side of the classroom preparing a
manuscript on nineteenth century
Spanish poet Gustavo Adolfo Bec-
quer, a personal favorite of hers.

West-Settle studied both Spanish
and French literature, but leans
toward Spanish because she ‘‘was
very interested in Spanish language
and culture, particularly because of
the blend of Eastern and Western
civilizations represented in Spain.
She refers to Spanish literature as “‘a
literature of the people, or ‘pueblo’,”
and describes it as “more spon-
taneous and less abstract and
philosophical” than French litera-
ture.

When at home with her husband,
Frank, and her fifteen-year-old
daughter, Cary, West-Settle enjoys
cooking, particularly Spanish food.
One of her favorite dishes is
“‘paella,’’ which contains rice and
either seafood or chicken. She also
enjoys running.

West-Settle earned her B.A. from
Agnes Scott College, her M.A.T. from
Georgia State University, and her
Ph.D. from Emory University. Her
hometown is Jackson, Tennessee.

the University of Virginia. Although
she will be teaching only Professor
Youngblood’s classes, she said that
she would be happy to explore new
areas if asked.

Amlinger’s hobbies — include
gardening, animals, and cooking.
“Some people even consider me an
especially good cook,” says Am-
linger. Although Amlinger still lives
in Charlottesville, she will be in Lex-

ditions — professors.

Among the new professional faces
is Thomas P. Whaley, professor of
computer science. Whaley came to
W&L from Central College in Iowa
where he was a professor of both
mathematics and computer science.
He received a B.S. degree from Lin-
coln Memorial University in 1964 and
a Ph.D. in math from Vanderbilt
University in 1968. Prior to teaching
at Central College he was the direc-
tor of the computer college at Rhodes
& Milsaps Colleges. :

Over the past 4 years, said Whaley,
the computer science department
has developed a strong curriculum,
allowing the department to offer ad-
vanced courses because students will
have strong backgrounds.

“Since I’ve had several years of
teaching at small colleges and hav-
ing experience with computer
centers as well as a strong math
background, I feel the position is
good for me.”

Whaley not only has interests in
computers, but running, camping,
tennis and hiking. He said he enjoys
the Lexington area.

Whaley is married and has three
sons. He will teach two new courses
this fall, Data Base Management and
Connectress. Both will be offered to
juniors and seniors.

Because of Dabney Stuart’s
absence this semester, there is a
temporary addition to the English
Department. Assistant Professor of
English Elizabeth Morgan will be
replacing Stuart. Morgan received
her B.A. from Hollins College (1960)
and her M.F.A. from Virginia Com-
monwealth University. She has
taught poetry and creative writing at
University of Richmond and is cur-
rently professor of creative writing
at St. Catherine’s School in Rich-
mond. Morgan has had many works
published in literary journals such as
the Shenandoah, the Virginia
Quarterly Review, and the Georgia
Review. At present, she is awaiting
the publication of her first book of
poetry entitled, “Parties.” (LSU
Press)

Morgan has three children; her
eldest son graduated from VMI, her
daughter works in Richmond, and
her youngest son goes to Christ
Church Boarding School. She has
spent much time in this area between
college and her children’s schooling
and finds Lexington ‘‘comfortable.”’

Morgan’s first impression of W&L
students is that ‘“‘they are brilliant,
self-confident, and ready to start the
new year.”’ Morgan is also ready and
excited to get working, too.

Richard Bidlack

By Jason Ladd Parker
Staff Reporter

 

The newest addition to Washington
and Lee’s history department is
Assistant Professor Richard Bidlack.
Bidlack is an instructor of European
history, concentrating on Russian
history. This year he will be teaching
“The Growth of Imperial Russia”
and “Soviet Russia” as well as two ‘
European civilization courses.

Bidlack’s interest in Soviet culture’
began early in his life, being born
during the height of theCold War. ~~ ¢

While at college, he was drawn to,
the Soviet-American relations of the
Detente period. Bidlack first visited
the Soviet Union in 1976 and returned |
‘to study in Lenigrad and Moscow
during the 1983-84 school year.

He received his Bachelor’s degree *
in history from Wake Forest Univer-
sity in 1977. At Indiana University, he
received both his M.A., in 1979, and &
his Ph.D., in 1987. Bidlack has taught
at Indiana University and lectured at
the Russian and East European In- -
stitute at Indiana University.

Bidlack intends to introduce a °
variety of Russian and East Euro-
pean courses, possibly including
courses concentrating on the Russian °
revolution, Stalinism, and Marxist-
Leninist thought. Another proposed
project of Bidlack’s is a Washington ©
and Lee study program in the Soviet
Union.

In this study program, students
would practice language skills and
tour various cultural regions of the
Soviet Union. Bidlack’s primary ob-
jective for this program is to “gain a
more direct application of Soviet
society and culture.”

Bidlack and his wife, Nancy, mov-
ed to Lexington July 11 of this year.
Nancy Bidlack is the news editor of
The News-Gazette.

Bidlack said that the small town
life in the mountains and Washington
and Lee’s strong history department
attracted him to W&L, however it
was the emphasis that W&L places
on teaching which had the strongest .
bearing on his decision to teach here.

research. In fact, as he says in his

any true scholar should be able to
share with understanding his re-
search to others.”

Outside of the classroom, Prof.
Jasiewiez, during his 2 year stay in
the U.S. has picked up on a few
American favorites. “I like the
Boston Red Sox and the New England
Patriots, but I’m still longing for a

Senior class opening convocation reinstated this year

 

»
By Margaret Pimblett
* Staff Reporter

 

‘* A Washington and Lee University
, tradition was reinstated Monday
when the Class of 1988 and faculty
* members gathered in Lee Chapel for
, an opening convocation.
A shortened morning class
«schedule allowed time for the con-
_ vocation, which began at 11 a.m. and
" Jasted about 70 minutes, and a lunch-
» eon for the seniors and the faculty.
According to Frank Parsons, the
“assistant to President John Wilson,
-until the late 1960’s the university
began each academic year with an
* assembly Attendance af thé

i convocation, held in Doremus Gym-

nasium, was mandatory.
‘ However, Parsons said, in 1969 the
, attendance policy was changed to
read that students were ‘‘expected,”’

le

not ‘‘required,” to attend.

After that change in policy, ‘‘atten-
dance was not very good,” Parsons
said.

The tradition of the opening con-
vocation was stopped in 1970, when
construction of the Warner Center
prevented assembly in Doremus, and
no other facility could accommodate
the entire student body and faculty,
Parsons said.

At Monday’s ceremony, President
Wilson said, “I am delighted that this
ancient tradition has been restored.”

In a letter to the senior class,
Wilson had written that the purpose
of the convocation was to ‘begin the
new year ie isclebtting the unity of

peveaatived ult aiprornts "

Wilson said, during his remarks at
the convocation, “We are heavily

would help contribute to the continui-
ty and faithfulness to tradition that
are part of the university.

The keynote speaker for the con-
vocation was Michael Kammen, the
Newton C. Farr Professor of
American History and Culture at
Cornell University and author of
“The Machine That Would Go of
Itself: The Constitution in American
Culture.”

Kammen spoke of the evolution of
the ideas of personal liberty and how
those ideas influenced and are af-
fected by the United States Constitu-
tion.

‘tThe conceptiof personal liberty is

tion,” Kammen said, In turn, he said,
the Constitution ‘infused personal
liberty with palpable new meaning.”

Kammen used examples from
American history to illustrate how
the theory of personal liberty has
changed.

In 1792, the concept was expanded
by the writings of James Madison,
who believed that ‘‘ ‘A man has pro-
perty in his opinion and the free com-
munication of them,’’’ Kammen
said.

“We perhaps enjoy a_ greater
degree of personal liberty than our
predecessors in American history,”
Kammen said.

“One of the privileges you have en-
joyed,”’ Kammen said to the senior
class, ‘‘is the right of personal con-
templation.”’

Student reaction to the convocation
was mixed. Senior Eric Cooper said
he thought the administration was
“trying to appease our class.’’ He

Library displays signatures

 

From Staff Reports

 

In celebration of the 200th anniver-
sary of the U.S. Constitution, the
Washingtoa and Lee University
Library is exhibiting a collection of
autographs of the 39 signers of the
Constitution.

The autograph collection is on loan
to the university from Susan Coblentz
Lane of Altavista, Va., whose father,
the late Rev. David Coblentz, col-
lected the autographs between 1952
and 1976. Rev. Coblentz served as the
minister at New Providence Pres-
byterian Church in Rockbridge Coun-
ty. Lane, whose husband, Douglas B.
Lane, is a 1979 W&L graduate, work-
ed in W&L’s McCormick Library
from 1976 to 1979.

Of the 55 delegates who attended
the Constitutional Convention 200
years ago, only 39 actually signed the
Constitution. The autographs of the

39 signers which Coblentz collected
appear on various documents in-
cluding personal letters, land titles,
governmental appointments and ac-
count books. All of the autographs
are in mint condition.

The self-guided exhibit is enhanced
by interesting biographical data and
engravings from portraits of the
signers. The exhibit is located in the
Boatwright Room of the library,
which is open Monday through Fri-
day from 9a.m.-5 p.m.

As a supplement to the Coblentz
autograph collection exhibit, an ex-
hibit of materials from the universi-
ty’s collection on James Madison,
“The Father of the Constitution,’ is
is on display in the main lobby of the
library. This exhibit inclides books,
manuscripts, and other materials
about the signers of the Constitution.
The exhibits, which are open to the
public, will be on display through
December.

Polo boots Army

 

By Hunter Catlett
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee water polo is
back and springing into the national
polls.

After an impressive 4-0 start at the
W&L Fall Classic, the Generals have
been ranked 19th in the latest Divi-
sion I national polls and fifth on the
East Coast.

The Generals return almost every-
one from a team that finished 21-11
and was considered one of the top 30
teams in the country last year.

“The team is virtually the same as
last year’s, but they are much im-
proved, much more consistent,”’ said
eighth-year head coach Paige
Remillard.

Remillard credits much of his
team’s improvement and consisten-
cy to their off-season work.

“Our team worked hard over the
summer, with a couple of our players
going to Southern California to play,”
said Remillard.

The Generals’ hard work paid off,

as they cruised to four impressive
victories in the tournament. The
team opened the classic on Friday
with a 24-5 shellacking of Lynchburg.
W&l played two games on Saturday,
defeating Dayton 22-11 in the morn-
ing and whalloping UNC-Wilmington
18-2 in the nightcap. These games set
the stage for the showdown with 20th-
ranked Army on Sunday.

This would be somethin
grudge match, as Army
W&L in overtime last year.

The Generals exploded out of the
blocks against Army with sophomore
Martin Bulingame scoring just 14
seconds into the game. The Generals
scored twice more before Army
could get on the scoreboard, and the
first period ended with W&L leading
3-1.

Momentum wore off during a
penalty-plagued 2nd period, and Ar-
my stormed back to tie the score at
five-all. Senior Simon Perez and
junior David Dietz both scored on
penalty shots during the last two
minutes of the period to give the
Generals a 7-5 halftime lead.

Soccer loses opener

 

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer season opened up yesterday
on Smith Field against Shenandoah,
and it was the Generals coming up on
the short end of the scoreboard with a
4-1 loss.

W&L came into the game under a
definite disadvantage, in that
Shenandoah had already played five
games this season.

“The whole team looked a little
sloppy,”’ said senior and co-captain
Chuck Lyle. Lyle shook off the notion
that the game being W&L’s first was
any excuse. He said the team was
confident going into the match, but
just wound up being out-hustled.

The lone goal was scored by
Patrick Brown, but it was the defense
that was somewhat suspect. Last
season, the defense helped then
junior goaltender Chris Gareis
establish a school record in career
shutouts.

The Generals will have to straigh-
ten out a few defensive problems
quickly. W&L’s next chance to get
back to its winning ways will be on

Saturday when the team travels to
Greensboro.

 

 

 

In fall of 1986 the Washington and
Lee men’s soccer team made them-
selves well known throughout the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference as the
team to be reckoned with. Defeating
eleven teams and suffering only four
losses, W&L had little difficulty cap-
turing the ODAC championship
Fortunately for the other teams in
the NCAA Division III tournament,
W&L was not extended a post-season
playoff bid.

The 1986 season will definitely be
difficult to match. There are 27
players on the team after the last
round of cuts on Saturday, including
seven freshmen. However, the team
lost three very strong players to
graduation—Pete Van Son, Jimmy
Tucker, and Tommy Pee.

Head coach Rolf Piranian, though
very optimistic about the season,
showed concern about the Generals
depth. ‘his is the first freshman
class we don’t have any starters,”
Piranian said. Although there is
great talent among the freshmen,
some of the finer points will take time
to develop

The second half belonged com-
pletely to W&L. The team roared out
to three straight goals to start the
third period and never looked back.
The Generals led 10-6 at the end of
three and continued to pull away in
the fourth period. The Generals led
14-7 with two and a half left when the
starters were pulled and held on for a
14-9 victory.

Dietz and junior David Reavy led a
balanced attack with five and three
goals, respectively. Balance was
one of the reasons for the Generals
‘success. Junior Moose Herring said,
“We have no one superstar. You
can’t stop just one person, or five
others will kill you.”

The Generals will need all of their
skill and balanced scoring this
weekend at the New England Varsity
Invitational if they are to hold onto
their national ranking. This tourna-
ment has the top-eight teams on the
East Coast competing.

The Generals will open against No.
3 Bucknell and, if W&L wins that

match, the team could become a fix-
ture in the National Polls this year.

head coach Gary Fallon as he enters
his tenth season at W&L are mostly
focused on the offense. Can the
Generals recover from the loss of
nine starters, including quarterback
John Thornton, a two-year starter,
and runningback Kevin Weaver, who
set six school records and rushed for
over 2400 yards in his career?

At least three sophomores were in

the running for the starting job at
quarterback — Phil Sampson, John
Durant, and Chris Smythe — as well
as junior Tony Waskiewicz. But
Fallon has settled on Sampson (6-2,
190) as the starter. Last year, Samp-
son saw virtually no playing time
—he completed one of two passes for
nine yards — but he has shown the
ability to perform under pressure: in
his first college track meet, Sampson
shattered the school record in the
pole vault.

Senior Chris Coffland (5-11, 170) is
expected to take over Weaver’s role
as W&L’s offensive workhorse. Cof-
fland finished third on the team in
rushing yardage in 1986 while also
returning punts and kickoffs, but
Fallon says he hopes to allow Cof-
fland to concentrate on tailback this
season. The rest of the starting
backfield will include seniors John
Roe (5-10, 175) at slot and sophomore
Russ Crosby (5-9, 195) at fullback.

 

Wide receiver returns

Haven't I seen him before?”’

Sometime during the first quarter of Saturday’s W&L football game,
opposing coach Lou Wacker of Emory & Henry probably looked out at
the W&L offense and wondered, ‘‘Who is that guy? That number 17...

Well, coach, the answer is yes, you have seen him before. Number 17

Law student Hugh Finkelstein
(5-10, 178), W&L’s leading receiver in
1985, returns at spilt-end. Senior Gar
Prebor (6-0, 180) will start at tight
end.

The offensive front is anchored by
all-American tackle John Packett.
“The Mountain’’ is listed at 6-4, 280,
but coach Fallon confesses that his
weight probably won’t dip below 300
anytime soon. As the Roanoke Times
and World News observed, this
lineman can really ‘‘Packett in’’ at
dinnertime. Bob Drake (6-2, 245), a
second team all-ODAC selection,
returns at offensive tackle. Juniors
David Surface (6-3, 215) and Julian
Phillips (6-1, 210) will start at the two
guard positions, and junior Rowan
Taylor (6-1, 215) will take over as
starting center.

Coordinator Chuck O’Connell’s 4-3
defense features the same backfield
as 1986, with senior Jeff Harwood
(5-10, 170) and sophomore Robert

Rimmer (5-10, 170) at the corners
and seniors Tom Donahoo (5-11, 165)
and Mark Oluvic (5-10, 170) at the two
safety positions. These four W&L
deep men combined for seven in-
terceptions in 1987, with Rimmer
pulling in four.

Sophomore Mike Pack (5-11, 190)
and junior Tom Skeen (5-10, 205),
W&L’s leading tacklers in 1986,
return as starting linebackers, with
junior Bill Crabill (5-11, 190) at the
other linebacker position. The front
four will feature seniors Jay
Gorlowski (5-10, 220), a returning
starter, at one tackle and Fred Skin-
ner (5-9, 225) at the other. Junior Jim
Johnson (6-2, 240) will once again
start at defensive end, and
sophomore Tripp Guillford (6-2, 205)
will be at the other end.

Skeen will once again punt for the
Generals, and the only freshman to
nail down a starting position will be
kicker Carter Quayle (6-1, 181).

E&H Wasps sting

Generals,

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Literally and figuratively, there
were few bright spots in W&L’s foot-
ball season opener Saturday. The
Generals were trounced by the
Wasps of Emory and Henry, 42-19,
but the rain-soaked game really
wasn’t even that close. Other than
some surprisingly good passing by
sophomore quarterback Phil Samp-
son, a first-time starter, the Generals
had a miserable day in miserable
weather in Emory, Virginia. Head
coach Gary Fallon is certainly not
alone in saying, ‘‘I sure hope they’re
one of the better teams we’ll play all
year.”

Check out the numbers—the Wasps
abused W&L in first downs (34-14)
and total offense (588-205). Emory
and Henry was supposed to rely on its
passing game more this season than
in 1986, when their offense featured
all-America tailback Sandy Rogers.
Nevertheless, the Wasps.rushed for a
total of 400 yards last Saturday, 89 of
them on 10 carries by junior Jamie
Cassell. In fact, four E&H runn-
ingbacks out-rushed the entire W&L
offense, which managed only 35
rushing yards on 27 attempts.

The Emory and Henry passing
game was just as good as the running
game, if not better. Starting QB Gary
Collier threw two incompletions and
then completed his next 12 attempts

42-19

for 170 yards and two touchdowns
before leaving the game in the third
quarter; he also rushed for 26 yards
and two TD’s of his own. The number
one passer in Division III last year,
Collier shows no signs of letting up in
1987.

W&L’s young quarterbacks did not
look good by comparison, but FalloA
has no reason to be disappointed,
Sampson completed 11 of 23 passes
for 144 yards and two touchdowns‘
said Fallon, ‘‘we thought he held his
own and really did an outstanding
job.” Sampson’s first touchdown
pass as a collegian came with 1:42
left in the first quarter, when he hit
senior John Roe with a 16-yarder; the
sophomore QB’s other scoring pass
was to law student Hugh Finkelstein
from 35 yards out with 9:45 remailr-
ing in the fourth.

»

Sampson’s replacement, sop-
homore Chris Smythe, completed
three of five passes for 26 yards and
one TD, a 14-yard pass to sophomore
Robert Martin. “He .came through
with the things that need to be done,”’
said Fallon of Smythe. ‘‘We’re pleas-
ed that he’s in there in that back- “up
role”

The return of Hugh Finkelstein to
W&L football probably wasn’t the,

first-year law student’s most en
joyable game, but he did show spark

is Hugh Finkelstein, a 1986 graduate of Washington and Lee, the owner
of a 4.6 time in the forty, a winner of two varsity football letters, and
W&L’s leading receiver in 1985. As a senior, he caught 35 passes for 515
yards and two touchdowns.

Yes, Hugh Finkelstein, the man who gave opposing defensive backs
nightmares in 1985, is back at W&L. You see, an injury kept him off the
football team as a freshman. Thus, when he returned to Lexington to
study law last month, he was carrying a year of football eligibility
along with his W&L diploma.

“Coach Fallon approached me about playing again, and football was
already in the back of my mind,” said Finkelstein. Washington and
Lee petitioned the NCAA, the NCAA said it was OK, and suddenly
Finkelstein is back at wide receiver for the Generals.

As you might imagine, trying to balance the demands of law school
and intercollegiate football isn’t the easiest way to spend a semester.
“So far, so good,” says Finkelstein. ‘‘It’s been straight from practice
to studying. On Saturdays, I study after games, and then go out later
on if I can.”’

And what has the man who caught a 52-yard pass against Maryville
been doing since graduation? The 1985 Generals’ leading receiver
tried out for the St. Louis Cardinals...the baseball Cardinals, that is.
Finkelstein played baseball as well as football during his
undergraduate years at W&L. In fact, he batted .440 as a junior. But,
fortunately for Gary Fallon and friends, Finkelstein wasn’t awarded a
contract by the Redbirds. And instead of trying out for the football
Cardinals, he’s back at W&L, studying law and giving nightmares to a
whole new group of defensive backs.

Women’s soccer makes change to varsity

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team has made the final step
up to the top platform.

Under the tutelage of men’s head
soccer coach Rolf Piranian, the
women’s team has been a develop-
mental sport for the past two spring

seasons. This fall, however, the

 

Preview

women’s team is ready to show that
it deserves varsity status.

This season, Janine Hathorn is the

 

head coach of the formidable group
of twenty-nine women soccer
players. The demanding practices
reduced the number of women who
tried out for the squad to those with
the highest level of interest and skill.
Hathorn stressed that both these
elements are essential to the success
and unity of the team. “I have great
expectations for the returning
sophomores and juniors because of
their experience,”’ Hathorn said. “I
am also confident in the progress of
the freshmen, as well as appreciative
of the amount of support and eager-
ness they contribute to the team.”
Hathorn is particularly impressed by
the tremendous effort and en-
thusiasm displayed by each squad
member despite rigorous practices.
The training is more difficult this
year to ensure that a high level of

competition can be attained.

The roster shows a good represen-
tation from each class, including Outi
Maeupaa, an exchange student from
Finalnd. Captains Laurel Mattson
and Liz Smith are juniors, along with
Lucy Anderson, Amy Balfour, Cathy
Boardman, Catherine Christian,

Catherine Council, Stephanie Lake,
Ann Large, Eleanor Nelson, Besty
Parkins, Alexa Salzman, and Tracy
Williams. The seven sophomore
players are Sarah Allen, Catherine
Baillio, Holly Gooding, Linda
Jackson, Mary Alice McMorrow,
Courtney Simmons, and Beth Stutz-

man. Representing the freshman
class are Cary Baber, Sherri Brown,
Ginger Gay, Kate Hanley, Paige
Kilian, JuLee Messerich, and
Rachelle Nock. With two weeks still
remaining before the first game,
Hathorn is not able to speculate
about the starting line-up.

Some thoughts on sports reporting

 

Shades on sports
By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

Last year we ran into a slight problem. I say ‘‘we” as in the
‘reporters for The Ring-tum Phi and the other students here at
Washington and Lee. What happened was not pleasant. A sports
reporter for The Phi, after writing an unfavorable story on an athletic
contest, was physically threatened by a few members of the athletic
team. It’s not important to know the names of the people or the team
involved. It is, however, important to analyze why the incident oc-
curred.

First let me throw out a question to you: What is the purpose of a
newspaper reporter? Well, in my opinion, a reporter’s job is to write
down the facts of an event and present them in an unbiased and
coherent story. Unbiased is the key word here, as an objective view-
point is crucial in order to allow the reader to make his or her own
judgments on the content of the story.

This formula is fine for most straight-forward news stories. But a
problem arises when the story is not so straight forward, such as a
sports story. Sure, a sports reporter could just write a basic simple
story telling the score, giving a chronological order of the game and
showing individual and team statistics, but this would be boring.
Sports Illustrated brags about how you can ‘‘get the feeling” when you
read their stories. Much of the same idea holds true when reporters
cover sporting events for newspapers, be it The Phi, The Washington
Post or The Richmond Times-Dispatch. The reporter has to go beyond
the retelling of the event and provide some ANALYSIS of the game.
Did the team come out flat? Why did the coach bench so-and-so? Were
they just beaten by a superior team or did they have an off day? Sud-
denly, that objectivé story has become a subjective one with the
reporter’s insights and opinions being added.

Okay, so now we have the mental approach | a sports réporter takes
when covering an athletic event. But there is much more to it than
that. A reporter for The Post writes a much different story than a
reporter for The Phi. Why? For one thing, a Post reporter has more
experience, more resources and a different audience. The Post is a
major daily newspaper in the United States and has a circulation of
millions, while The Phi is just a small weekly newspaper for a small
liberal arts college in Virginia and has a circulation of roughly 2,500. A
Post reporter can be more critical and take more chances when
writing a story because he/she has strong organizational backing.

 

 

 

 

Also, a Post reporter does not see at lunch in the dining hall the next
day the athlete he just criticized in the papers. Some doors might be
closed the next time around, but a Post reporter doesn’t have to worry
about facing that athlete in a D-hour class.

Which leads into another problem. Since the reporters for The Phi
are students, many of the athletes they are writing about are their
friends. Do you report the story the way you saw it or do you jeopar-
dize a good friendship? Believe it or not, The Phi is not out to nail
anybody to the wall. No one wants W&L teams to lose. If I could, I
would print only positive aspects of the W&L athletic programs. But
then, I wouldn’t be putting out a journalistically-sound newspaper and
I wouldn’t be serving you as readers.

So let’s look back at what caused the problem. Some athletes took
exception to a story printed in the Phi because they felt it didn’t ac-
curately portray what really happened in the game. An understan-
dable situation, but the athletes acted immaturely by threatening the
student-reporter with violence. The solutions? Well, first of all, the
athletes here at W&L are going to have to learn how to accept
criticism. When you're an athelte, that’s what comes with the ter-
ritory.

I think another answer would be for the athletes to realize that we
reporters are full-time students, just like you. As a reporter, you just
don’t always have the time to double-check the facts. We are also
human, so mistakes (mainly stupid ones) will be made. I remember
last year The Phi identified Robert Rimmer of the football team as a
senior when he was really a freshman. An incredibly dumb error and
one that should have been avoided, but, hey, I can remember even
dumber mistakes I have made in my lifetime.

For the reporters, I think obtaining quotes from the PLAYERS and
not just the coaches would establish a better working relationship with
the team. Give the people involved a chance to explain themselves and
express what they feel happened. Also, watch the games. Follow the
sport with some interest. Your story sounds so much better if you
know the intricacies of the team.

Hopefully, there will be no problems similar to last year’s. I’m look-
ing forward to the 1987-88 athletic season. And please, keep in mind
what’s been said here. I think everything will go much smoother if you
do.

NOTES — God, say it ain’t so! Those pesky New York Mets are back in
contention. If the Mets win the National League East, I’ll promise to
take my sunglassess off for the following week’s column. I’ve got my
fingers crossed... Hats off to CBS for it’s coverage of the U.S. Open.
Pat Summerall, Tony Trabert and John Newcombe were all outstand-

best athletes, according to Fallon,
Finkelstein pulled in four Sampson
passes for 66 yards, including the 35-
yard touchdown toss late in the
game.

It would be a gross understatement
to say the W&L defense had a rough
afternoon. Despite causing six
fumbles and recovering five, the
Generals simply couldn’t get around
the physically larger Wasp offensive
line. Together, the Emory and Henry
front players average almost 230

Words In Edgewise

The Ring-tum Phi, September 17, 1987

Bakkerscam - The Final Chapter

By Marshall Boswell
Staff Reporter

Now that the hoopla, for the most
part at least, has long since come to
pass, it is time, I think, to look at one
last, but vitally important, aspect of
the recent Jim and Tammy Bakker
phenomenon.

The question of whether or not
“religious television’’ is what it says
it is (sure it’s television, but is it
“religious?’’) has been examined so
thoroughly that my merely bringing
the subject up has probably already
caused you to look around desperate-
ly for something large and unyielding
to throw through a window. The term
“religious television’’ is, at the very
least, a bad oxymoron: this we all
know. And the Jim and Tammy af-
fair has no doubt caused You Know
Who more sleepless milleniums than
most of us mortals could ever ap-
preciate.

But isn’t it true that nearly every
child in these United States watches
television ‘‘religiously?” We may not
all have a personal relationship
with God, and a great many of us
may have been blissfully spared the
embarrassment of being counted
among Jim and Tammy’s close ac-
quaintances, but we all know one
thing in common: we all know
television—many of us ‘‘religiously.”’
And as far as telaesthetics go, the
PTL Club was absolutely sublime
tube.

Let’s be honest here: Everybody, it

seems, has an opinion on the PTL
Club—that it was corrupt, a lie, a
malignant tumor on the face of
Christianity—and, well, most of
these opinions, I might venture, were
more often than not right on the
mark. But how many of us actually
ever watched the show?

I, for one, did. Back in the B.C.
years (‘before cable’) Jim and
Tammy broadcasted their twisted lit-
tle slab of devout weirdness from
deep in that frightening forest known
as Late Night Weekend Television. A
quick spin of the dial at 2:00 a.m. ona
Friday night might yield a poorly-
dubbed martial arts movie, a two
hour long episode of ‘‘Mannix”’ and a
telethon for African famine relief.
And in the midst of all this came
“The PTL Club’ — an hour’s worth
of late night viewing that had a pro-
found affect on me as an adolescent.

Jim and Tammy had the basic re-
ligious television premise: There
was what looked like a living room,
with a couch and a coffee table, win-
dows and decorative furnishings, all
of which were situated on a raised
stage and surrounded by a studio
audience. Guests sat around the cof-
fee table and gave religious testi-
monials, perhaps did a bit of singing,
and then left the stars of the show
alone to give the Pitch. But Jim and
Tammy were different.

my were hopelessly and hysterically
tasteless.

Jim and
Tammy were special. Jim and Tam-

For starters, there was simply too
much furniture — too many plants,
too many vases, too many couches.
The whole thing looked, it has been
said, like a discount furniture
showroom. And, my God, the guests
Jim and Tammy invited: Christian
New Wave hair dressers, Christian
dwarf unicycle teams, Christian gar-
bage men, Christian flame swallow-
ers. Jim and Tammy weren't the
Johnny Carson of religious televi-
sion. They weren’t even Merv Grif-
fith. They were probably closer to be-
ing David Lettermans — only Jim
and Tammy meant it.

And then there was the audience.
There they would be, Jim and
Tammy’s multitude, clapping empti-
ly like those poor souls who have to
attend the Saturday afternoon film-
ing of your local TV station’s studio
wrestling broadcast. But again, the
difference here was that this aud-
ience loved it. The question is, where
did this crew come from? Teenage
kids with ‘‘punk” haircuts, senior
citizen couples in lime green
polyester jumpsuits and matching
dribble cups, two hundred and
eighty-five pound fathers decked out
in sagging Wragler jeans and black
“Chevvy!’’ T-shirts. The PTL
faithful. Jim and Tammy’s flock.

But lastly there was Jim and Tam-
my. Jerry Falwell is a politician,
Robert Schuller is a pop psycholo-
gist, and Jim Swaggert is a misguid-
ed meglomaniac; but Jim and Tam-

R.E.M. pens “‘Document”’

By Greg Unger
Music Critic

Document, R.E.M.’s 7th album, is
certainly no surprise. It seems in fact
that every September we can expect
to hear from Athen’s Ga.’s finest as
they bring us the latest edition of
their bi-annual musical master-
pieces. Their latest effort is no dissa-
pointment, bringing with it the abili-
ty to sound better every time you
hear it; which should be quite often.
There is, however, one sole fault.
Though good, the songs sound rather
similar-almost forcing you to listen

repeatedly just to dissemble and
recognize the different songs.

A few tracks stand out, however.
Document opens strongly with “The
Finest Worksong’’—a slightly harsh-
er R.E.M. tune than usual, yet one of
the most powerful songs on the ‘‘A’”’
side. Songs No. 2 and No. 4 are
nothing special, but sandwiched be-
tween them is “Exhuming McCar-
thy” an interesting song with more
than decent lyrics and a pleasant
overall feel. ‘‘Strange’’ follows
“Disturbance at Heron House’’ and
along with “King of Birds’’
resembels the most memorable

PARENTS
ALUMNI

songs off Life’s Rich Pageant.
“Lightnin Hopkins” is the bright
spot of Document’s ‘‘B”’ side, with a
good drum effort and catchy chorus
sung by the rest of the guys. By the
way, Michael Stipe’s voice remains
distinct throughout the album, and it
seems that R.E.M. has matured into
what they’re always going to be. In-
deed, Docment seems comfortable
following Dead Letter Office and

my were celebrities, It is probably
not too far-fetched to imagine them
as a husband and wife country music
act. They would have been huge. Now
everybody has said it, but I'll say it
again: Jim had boyish good looks.
The guy was forty and still looked
like that kid in your high school class
with mayonnaise-smeared braces
and terrible acne. But Jim was a pro-
fessional. He had a certain slickness
about him, an admirable flair for
showmanship, that kept him from be-
ing a just a worthless joke. None of
this mattered, of course, because
Jim also had Tammy Faye. She
didn’t seem like she could be real: all
that makeup, those horrendous
clothes, the tears and the stomach-
churning melodrama. Certainly she
wasn’t to be taken seriously. Just
when Jim would get on a roll, asking
for pledges, praying for the Christian
dwarf unicycle team, whatever,
Tammy would break in, that shrill
dissonant voice coming through like
a stray radio signal. And Jim would
shoot her the Look — a sincerely
pissed-off husband stare that implied
in no uncertain terms for her to Shut
Up. They were as good as Lucille Ball
and Ricky Ricardo — but again, the
difference was that they meant it.
This was real domestic tension —
how could they have orchestrated it
all? And if they did, then they were
much more clever than anybody has
given them credit for being.
Too bad you missed it all.

Womens’ group
.gets new name

’

 

By Jessica Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

Trident, previously known as
Women’s Forum, has put on a new
face.

“We are not here to change the
campus, nor are we a radical move-
ment. We are here to create other op-
portunities and alternatives. We
want to encourage new ideas as a
whole,” said junior Alston Parker,
president of the organization.

It has been two years since the
women students at W&L created an
organized program directed to help
provide leadership opportunities,
social outlets, sports activities and
community service involvement for
women.

Trident was formed in the spring of
1986 and is housed in what is known
as the Women’s Center, which will
also undergo a name change.

The center is located in the base-
ment of the University Center, in
what used to be the television room.

Now the area has been divided into
a television/social room and a study
room. It is brightly lit, has lounging
chairs, couches, a large television
and plants.

The group appointed Meredith
Walker, a junior, to head a commit-
tee responsible for forming policy
and bylaws for the center. Under this
committee, the center will be renam-
ed for a woman in W&L’s history,
said Parker.

Trident is expecting a lot of support
and hard work from its officers —
junior Julie Sheppard, vice-president

and treasurer; Catherine Baillo, sec-
retary; and Erin Crosby, Elizabeth

Smith, Kara Cunningham and
Kristen Haring, class represen-
tatives.

Freshman representatives will be
elected Oct. 13. A pizza party for
freshmen will be held following the
elections.

The freshman elections are being
held later so that they can meet each
other and learn more about the
organization, said Parker.

The officers of Trident are con-
cerned about freshman involvement
in the organization.

“The problem is: How do we con-
tact them and let them know they are
wanted?” said Smith.

“We hope to encourage all
undergraduate women to become in-
volved. It’s their enthusiasm and
participation that makes it a suc-
cess,’’ she said.

“It is a great way to incorporate all
three classes of women,” added
Smith.

“Through freshman involvement
we can create a lasting bond with the
organization and strengthen the par-
ticipation and leadership also,’’ said
Parker.

Trident meetings will be held every
Monday at 7 p.m., and all meetings
are open to the public.

The group has begun to make plans
for a social calendar, fund-raising ac-
tivities and community service pro-
jects.

“Hopefully through community
service, we will have a positive im-
pact on the community,” said
Parker.

Parents’ Weekend is the first
target for a group social activity.
Plans are in motion to hold a cocktail
party for parents of all students that
weekend.

The group is making an extra ef-
fort to put forth a “positive energy
which will add to the existing system
rather than detracting from it,’’ said
Crosby.

“T think since the reorganization of
the group this fall, we have seen so
much more positive attitudes and
more enthusiasm about the group
itself,’ said Sheppard.

Parking problem called ‘horrible’

Some of the most frequent com-
plaints at W&L have been about the
perennial parking problem that con-
tinues to plague the University. As
anyone who commutes from off-
campus knows, parking near the
classrooms is a precious commodity.

“Every morning it gets more in-
teresting to see how creative parking
gets in the ‘corral,’’’ says E.C.
President Brad Root. “There is a
definite need for more parking
facilities for upperclassmen who live
off-campus.”’

“The freshmen have to park near
Liberty Hall. That is so ridiculous!”
said junior Jessica Reynolds, in
reference to the distant parking
facility currently used by freshmen.

University Proctor Charles F.
‘“‘Murph’”’ Murray readily acknowl-
edges that an overcrowding problem
continues to exist in such parking
areas as ‘‘the corral,” the parking
area located in front of the Universi-
ty.
“It’s horrible, isn’t it?” says Mur-
ray, regarding the morning conges-
tion of the “‘corral.”’

| a IE

“T’ve told the University architects
that if they’d take out those fancy
curbs they could have 50 to 60 more
lots down there — to which they
replied, ‘We can’t have it looking like
a shopping mall.’ ”

Murray says the administration
meets every three to four months to
discuss the on-going parking problem
and ways in which it can be resolved.

“I’m in on [the administration]
about it every week,” he said. Mur-
ray added that this past summer the
Law School parking area was ex-
panded to ‘‘get the students off the
road,”’ a task currently being under-
taken at the new Gaines Hall, where
towing of cars parked on the street
has begun.

However, if Murray is quick to
acknowledge a problem, assistant to
the president Frank Parsons is just
as quick to dispel one. According to
Parsons, the only problem that exists
is that ‘everybody wants to park
within 30 seconds of their destination
and they are unwilling to walk.”

Parsons describes W&L parking as
quite adequate in comparison to the
parking situation at other colleges
and universities where, he said,
students take it for granted that they
are expected to park far from their
classes and do a great deal of walk-
ing.

Dean Richard Heatley, Director of Career Services.

“Sure [W&L students] think we’ve
got a parking problem. It’s because
they can’t park next to the dorms,”

he said, Parsons said that available...

parking spaces total about 1,000, with
half of those being designated for
commuting students.

Parsons added that at present,
there were some parking lots off-
campus still not being used by
students, most notably the lot on
McDowell Street near Gaines Dorm.

“There is plenty of space there for
Gaines Dorm residents, but when I
drove by last night, there were
maybe two cars parked there,’’ said
Parsons.

Parsons said that until all existing
parking is used, students will con-
tinue to complain.

“Tf people are willing to park in the
available lots and walk that extra
five minutes, then we will have no
problem,” he said.

Parsons also said he wants
students to realize the parking solu-
tion lies on the edge of the campus,
not within it.

Two remedies to the situation have
been discussed by Parsons and Mur-
ray. One is to build a parking garage
in downtown Lexington that would be
used by both students and _ local
citizens. However, according to Par-
sons, city approval would be needed

The officers think the new
organization will work much better
and can be a part of the W&L system.

“We are trying to improve our im-
age and the image of women at
W&L,” said Cunningham.

Office hours for Trident are 4 p.m.
to 6 p.m. Monday, Wednesday and
Thursday. Tuesday hours are 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m. and Sunday the office is
open 7 p.m. to9p.m.

A suggestion box is located in the
center, and the officers said they are
more than happy to hear from any-
one for suggestions.

 

IFC establishes
two seminars

 

By David Emrich
Co-Editor

 

Last night, at their regular weekly
meeting, the Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil voted to establish two seminars to
educated the freshmen who pledged
a fraternity.

The measure, which passed unan-
imously, established two 30 to 45
minute seminars, to be held in con-
secutive weeks. These seminars
would educate fraternity pledges on
their responsibilities as fraternity
members.

According to IFC President Mark
Farley, the first meeting will concern
Alcohol Awareness and the second
will deal with the IFC Constitution,
focusing more closely on the IFC’s
guidelines for safe partying.

A third meeting, on hazing, was re-
jected by the IFC even though
Associate Dean of Students Leroy C.
““Buddy”’ Atkins warned that, if any
problems with hazing occured, the
Trustees have decided to revoke the
involved fraternity’s charter with no
chance for appeal.

The first program, according to
Farley, will be conducted by Special

sh ee

rs
+a

Le ‘haa

Agent Koger Stevens of the Virginia
Alcohol Beverage Control and
another speaker who has yet to be
named. The second program, said
Farley, will be conducted by Atkins,
any member of the IFC Judicial
Board who wishes to participate, and
Farley. No firm date or time has
been set for the meetings and the
Fraternities’ pledge programs will
not be delayed.

Also at last night’s meeting, Atkins
warned that there will be stricter en-
forcement of the IFC’s Regulations
for Parties, especially the section
which requires food and alternative
beverages at all fraternity parties.

“In the past,” said Farley, “the
IFC looked the other way as far as
some rules were concerned. But that
is not going to be the case anymore.”

Any violation of the food and alter-
native beverage requirement will be
treated as a regular social violation
and the offending houses will be
given social probation, said Farley.

According to Farley, several~
fraternities were given violations by
the Lexington Police for having trash
in front of their houses. He said that
any future violations would result in
an additional $50 fine imposed by the
IFC.

for that.

Another proposal, according to
both Murray and Parsons, is to
create a multi-level parking facility
behind Doremus Gym, where two
parking areas currently exist.

However, Parsons says such a pro-
ject would be extremely costly for
the University and unlikely in the im-
mediate future, since construction on
Gaines Hall is still being completed.
Until then, if off-campus students

Phote by Amanda Hughen

expect to park near the University,
they are encouraged to leave home
early. Otherwise they should be
prepared to park as far away as
Liberty Hall, and to take along a pair
of walking shoes.

New director plans new career programs

 

By Stacy Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

Tipping back in his chair, with his
hands behind his head, Dr. Richard
Heatley speaks of his welcome to
Washington and Lee and Lexington
as both ‘warm and encouraging.”

As well it should be, for Heatley, an
involved, energetic individual, was
named Associate Dean of Students
and Director of Career Services in
April. He has a great deal of excite-
ment and experience to offer to the
position, which he assumed on July 1
of this summer.

Heatley worked in career planning
for eight years at Wake Forest
University. Initially he was a pro-
fessor of classics, but in his 17 years
at Wake Forest, he became in-
terested and involved in ad-
ministrative activities. In 1979, he
was named associate director of the
Career Planning and Placement Of-
fice at Wake Forest. In 1983 he
assumed the position of director of
that office.

Heatley said of Career Planning at
Wake Forest, ‘I enjoyed it a lot and
found it new and interesting since it
was something I didn’t have training
and background in.”’

Heatley is a ‘Texan by birth,’’ who
lived in Fort Worth and attended

Forth Worth High School. He receiv-
ed his bachelor’s degree from Baylor
University, where he had a triple ma-
jor in Latin, Spanish and education
with a minor in religion. Heatley then
attended University of Texas at
Austin where he received a master’s
degree in Spanish and a doctorate in
classics. In 1971, he was awarded a
Fulbright-Hayes Fellowship to Italy,
where he taught two semesters of
programs abroad in Venice. Heatley
is also a member of Omicron Delta
Kappa leadership society.

Heatley is a member of profes-
sional associations, including the Col-
lege Placement Council, the
Southern College Placement Associa-
tion, the Middle Atlantic Conference,
the Skylark Liberal Arts Conference
and the Association of Pre-Law Ad-
visers. These organizations ‘‘assist
us in training the students for their
oC employments,” Heatley
said.

Beyond his professional interests,
Heatley is also active in community
organizations and services. He was a
deacon and choir member of the
Wake Forest Baptist Church, and
hopes to continue singing here in Lex-
ington. He was also a United Way
university coordinator.

Heatley and his family reside in
Lexington. His wife, Ester, teaches
at Waddell Elementary School. They
have two children; a son who is atten-

ding Lexington High School and is in
the 10th grade, and a daughter in the
third grade. He said he and his wife
“are avid gardeners.’’ But beneath
all his calm pastimes and interests
lies a four don black belt. Heatley ran
a program in karate at Wake Forest
for 13 years. He instructed 125
students per semester and would like
to run such a program here. Heatley,
the first formal director of the Career
Development and Placement Center
for more than a year, has many
responsibilities, including individual
and group counseling, career infor-
mation, job hunting workshops,
management of recruiting, outreach
activities and service as a pre-law
adviser. Heatley will also teach a
Latin course in both the fall and
winter terms.

When asked of his plans for the
Career Center, Heatley commented
that he was “excited by the fine
caliber of the Washington and Lee
students. It is a positive thing to ‘sell’
to recruiters who know that these
students are academically driven.”’
Which, he added, is important for a
school of this size. Wake Forest is a
university of approximately 35,000
students, but Heatley finds little dif-
ference in the work for him.

“T don’t perceive the work load as
being any lighter due to the fact that
the slack got taken up by the fact that
the staff here is not as large.”

Heatley has already accomplished
a great deal for the Career Center.
His approach, he said, is ‘full on-
campus recruitment,”’ meaning that
he wants to reach as many students
as possible.

“Traditionally,”’ said Heatley,
“those who used the service were the
poeple who were ‘career specific,’
those who were pre-law or intending
to be in conventional business, such
as Sales or banking.”’

However, Heatley wants to at-
tempt to reach out to those with no
career focus or those who have ma-
jors in areas such as art, music or
history. ‘‘Those students are the ones
who need direction,’ Heatley said.
“This is one of the goals of the
outreach program.”’

Among the new services to be of-
fered are Career Lecture Series,
Alumni Career Assistance Program,
Summer Job Day, expanded career
library and resource library, com-
puterized office operations and
records, more video mock interviews
and a monthly newsletter. Heatley
held a Senior Placement Meeting last
Tuesday, which 175 students attend-
ed. He also reached another 37
seniors through a_ student-athlete
meeting.

“Already I have reached over 200
seniors,’ Heatley said, ‘‘and I hope

Growth affects locked carrels

 

MY VIEW

By John Starks

 

It seems that signs of our school’s
growth beyond its physical plant’s
capacity are becoming more
numerous. The freshman class has
more than 425 members, a new dorm
was built, class sizes are growing
beyond classroom space, and park-
ing spots are more and more
precious every day. Yet along with
these major examples of over-
crowding, there are also some seem-
ingly minor ones. I speak particular-
ly concerning the paucity of locked
study carrels in the University
Library.

These carrels may not be impor-
tant to most W&L students, but they
certainly are for seniors writing
honors thesis. An immediate reason
for senior acquisition of locked car-
rels is for easy access to library
sources. Anyone who has written a
major term paper knows the large
number of books he must use for such
a project. Transportation of so many
volumes outside the library is im-
practical and bad for students’
backs, especially considering the

To the Editor:
Mingled with the joys of Rush

disappointment in the

 

distances often covered by book-
toting pupils. Other sources like
periodicals, microfilms, and archive
works cannot be taken from the
library, so without a place inside the
library to examine them thoroughly,
the student is at a distinct disadvan-
tage.

The carrels’ location on campus is
also important for a student like me
who lives in the county. Without a
carrel in which to leave work, all too
frequent trips to school are
necessary.

The public carrels are not the
answer to this problem First, they
are not big enough for the student to
spread out the number of works he
may need to examine at one time.
Nor do they contain enough storage
space for sources after examination.
Secondly, there are already not
enough public carrels for W&L
students, so another space problem
arises. The public carrels are too
noisy. The library is not a quiet
place, especially around exam time.
Finally, the public carrels are too
‘‘public.’’ Anyone can use them, so if
any part of the carrel owner’s work is
moved, he may not find it.

Blame does not lie with the library.
It only has thirty-one locked study
carrels. Library officials gave
preference to student applications
from those enrolled in senior honor

LETTER

87, there is
some sadness, and, more importantly some
conduct
‘gentlemen!’ This disappointment stems from an
onslaught of insidious rumors concerning Zeta
Beta Tau’'s financial strength. We do not unders-
tand how one can comment accurately on our
house’s financial position without even review-
ing our books. Apparently, many individuals at
W&L fancy themselves clairvoyants as well as
certified public accountants. Fortunately, few
members of the audience were impressed by the
strutting and fretting of these poor players;
some freshmen took these rumors for what they
are: full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
These persons were able to see the ignorance in-
herent in the rumors. In the future, we hope
rumor-mongers refrain from tainting others’
minds with incorrect information concerning us.
William Kennon Thornton,

President Zeta Beta Tau ’88

Burton Balser Wright III 90

of W&L’s

preciated.

To the members of the student body:

The purpose of this letter is to dispel any
rumors which may already exist, or may come
about in the future. The Phi Chapter of Delta Tau
Delta has been adversely affected by certain
sanctions brought about by the Interfraternity
Council and the Student Affairs Committee. We
would like to make it clear that the Delt house
does currently exist as a fraternity and will con-
tinue to exist as such on the W&L campus.
Although our rush activities were canceled due
to the sanctions, we are still affiliated with our
national fraternity and have received their full
support in this difficult period. And, with their
assistance we plan to thank all of the fraternities
at W&L for their support for it is greatly ap-

courses, which is only fair. About
twenty-five applications were made
for carrels this year, mostly by
honors candidates. The University
Scholars Program requires _ its
members to write theses, so the
number of honors candidates is
larger than in previous years.
However, only fifteen students re-
ceived locked carrels because the
other sixteen are already occupied
by faculty members.

I do not begrudge faculty members
the rights and privileges of their posi-
tions, but I also believe that since
they have an on-campus office, their
needs for locked carrels are less than
those of students who must complete
honors theses. Students often cannot
control their study environment
since they live with other students
who might not be working at the
same time. The library is sometimes
the only place they can work private-
ly. If they are denied that, where can
they turn? I shall not begin work on
my thesis until the winter term, but
what can I do then and what will
others do whose applications were
denied? Compromises must be made
to faciliate the professors’ and
students’ academic demands. After
all that’s what W&L is all about. But
consideration and mutual respect
should be paramont in whatever
agreements can be made.

MY VIEW

Most college students will in-
evitably find themsevles homesick at
some point during their education.
For freshmen it usually happens
after the novelty of doing your own
laundry, uncontroversively keeping
a messy room, and staying out late
for no apparent reason soon wear off.
Most students will miss their friends,
their pets and possibly their high
schools. This version of homesick-
ness will painfully wear off with
time; any afflicted person has
nothing to worry about.

But, on the other hand, some col-
lege students might find themselves
actually missing their families which
is chronic homesickness and very
often life threatening. An individual

homesickness needs help immediate-

We finally arrived in Utah and left
in one hour for California (that was
our leisurely break in between
travel). Naturally, we soon en-
countered car trouble which wasn’t a
total loss because I now personally
know every mechanic between Utah
and California, and consequently can
make a few generalizations. I’ll start
with nomenclature: a threee letter
first name is compulsory. Joe, Sam,
Tim, Roy or Jim are good examples.
I didn’t meet one mechanic with a
name like Winston or Ogolthrope.
Mechanics are either incredibly am-
bitious or extremely lacadaisical.
The ambitious type will systemat-
ically disassembly your whole car
whiel you sit in the broiling sun for 3
hours. The ‘“‘lackadasicals” are
usually sitting in rocking chairs whit-
tling wood but they don’t have time to
fix your car.

Every mechanic tells you
something different and none are
right; but fortunately cars were
manufactured to always work at gas

stations but not in the middle of the
desert. Eventually we learned so
much from hanging out at so many
gas stations that we fixed the car
ourselves.

As you might imagine by this time
all family members wer? enthralled
with fantasies of matricide, patricide
and fratricide. Eventually we stop-
ped in Winnemucca, Nevada, which
jokingly expressed how boring it was
through billboard signs. The signs
said things like ‘‘Winnemucca — the
name says it all,”’ or “Winnemucca
— free admission.”

We soon realized that the signs
were not joking. Winnemucca’s only
asset was hiring someone smart
enough to get vulnerable people like
my family to stop there. The hotel we
stayed at had carpet thicker than a
rain forest. We lost the dog twice.

I could go on for hours about this
vacation, but I’m certain most of you
are already trying to figure out ways
to stay at college for Thanksgiving.
By the way, the climax of the trip
was seeing a sign in Conn, Calif.,
which read Conn Dam.

The Ring-tum Phi: What’s in a name?

A football cheer, a student newspaper and nearly a century of W&L history

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

“Ring-tum Phi, Stickeri Bum!
We are the stuff from old Lexington!
» Rah! Rah! Rah! White and Blue!
Whoopla, Whoopla! W.L.U.”’
* Almost a century ago, Washington and Lee students us-
, ed to snake-dance to that nonsense football cheer during
halftime. In some later and more risque versions, the
*second line asserts that we are “hot stuff from Lex-
ington.’’ Whatever the version, it was from this favorite
“cheer that a group of students drew the name for W&L’s
«Student newspaper.
The Ring-tum Phi’s very first issue was published on
“"Saturday, Sept. 18, 1897. The front page featured
.highlights from President Wilson’s inaugural address
(no, not our President Wiison — The Honorable William
‘L. Wilson). Sports news and personal items made up

‘ most of the rest of the paper.

The first editorial began:

“Tt is with some embarrassment that the editors place
the first number of The Ring-tum Phi before the students.
*We hope nevertheless that everyone will be lenient with
, our mistakes and help us out of the difficulties we will be

very grateful to you. [sic]’’

* The purpose of the new student newspaper was to, as
, the editors put it, ‘put all the current campus college

news where it can be seen by every student.’’ Further-
’ more, the paper would ‘‘not be the political organ of any

, crowd.”
The cost of a year’s subscription: $1.50.

, The first editor, Gordon Houston, had trouble per-

‘ low rates and a promise of placement on the front page

The paper was not suppressed and outlived the ‘‘two-
point slash’’ practice for each class cut. The paper had
survived the controversy and become a forum for student
discussion.

The paper was surviving financially as well. Within
five years, The Ring-tum Phi had pulled itself out of the
financial ruin of its first year and was clearing $500 a
year above its expenses.

The paper itself has undergone some changes. The first
issues were about four pages long. Throughout the years,
that number gradually has increased.

Hu-man-ic shoes

The size of the paper has also fluctuated. The very first
copies of the paper were printed on sheets of paper that
were approximately 11 inches by 14 inches. During the
war years when baper was scarce, the paper was printed
on smaller sheets of paper.

During the early 1980s, editors experimented in prin-
ting the paper in tabloid form. For the most part though,
the paper has been printed on paper the same size as it is
today, which is known as broadsheet.

The first illustration appeared in The Ring-tum Phi in
1898 in an ad for ‘‘Hu-man-ic Shoes”’ ($4 a pair). The first
photograph appeared on the front page of the Phi on Oct.
20, 1900. It was a photo of W&L President William Lynne
Wilson, who had died of pulmonary tuberculosis earlier
that week.

The masthead slogan added by Farrar was changed to
“By the Students, For the University’ around 1910, and
much later, the slogan was dropped altogether.

The paper, which began as a weekly paper and is cur-
rently a weekly paper, was semi-weekly from September
1921 to March 20, 1970. There were two separate staffs
and editors — a Tuesday staff and a Friday staff — to
handle putting out two papers each week.

In 1973, there was a proposal to abolish the paper. The
Publications Board rejected the proposal to suspend the
publication of the newspaper ‘‘primarily because of the
response to student questionnaires, which was strongly in
support of The Ring-tum Phi.”

Perhaps one of the most surprising things that has not
changed is the name. In 1920, the editors began an
editorial campaign to change the paper’s name.

“We believe The Ring-tum Phi has outgrown its name
and the time has come when it means absolutely
nothing,’’ said the editorial.

“The name of The Ring-tum Phi is distinctive, it has
served a useful purpose for a third of the century, it is
known and loved by thousands of alumni, and its recur-
ring issues awaited with pleasures. When old Washington
and Lee is two hundred and fifty years older, may she
still have a loyal and progressive and vigorous editor and
may his chair be in the office of The Ring-tum Phi,” the
alumnus closed.

In the next issue, the editorial headed ‘‘We concede”’
read as follows:

“The Ring-tum Phi will continue to be The Ring-tum
Phi. This was decided at the Executive Committee
meeting. We would like to see the name changed, but
we’ve been overruled and we recognize higher authori-

ty.”

paper from his pocket. Farrar added a masthead slogan
to the paper: ‘‘By the Students, For the Students.”’

It wasn’t too long before people other than W&L
students began to take notice.

In 1898, the faculty habitually slashed a student’s grade
by two points for each class the student cut.

ple demanded that The Ring-tum Phi, or at least that

“The Ring-tum Phi here asks the Executive Committee

of the student body to pass a resolution changing the
name of the paper, which name is to be selected later,
provided the majority of the student body desires it,’”’ the
editorial continued.

The editorial caused several alumni to write in support

of the name. One letter pointed out that the editor had run

the name, wasn’t he attempting to destroy the very
publication that gave him office? The alumnus pointed
out that readers were attracted to a paper because of its
contents, not its name.

‘‘Washington and Lee has a real newspaper!’’ exclaim-
ed E. Lee Trinkle, a University of Virginia student who
later became governor of Virginia, after seeing the
editorial.

The Oct. 2, 1897, issue of The Ring-tum Phi listed ‘the
snag:’

“The numerous fraternities in our midst have been, to
some extent, hampered in their fall ceremonies by the
scarcity of freshmen. Nevertheless some have done quite
well and are not bewailing the hard times.” The article
then went on to list the names and total number of
pledges for each house:

Sigma Chi—4

Sigma Alpha Epsilon—3

Phi Kappa Psi—4

Sigma Nu—4

Kappa Alpha—1

Delta Tau Delta—3

Mu Pi Lambda—1

Kappa Alpha also pledged four transfer students.

Freshman beanies

An editorial in the May 10, 1966 issue discussed the lack
of parking facilities on the W&L campus.

“As the number of student-owned cars increases, the
problem of inadequate parking space on campus grows
more severe. It has now reached the point when the hap
py soul with a 10:15 a.m. class is unable to park
anywhere, save in the rutted auto graveyard behind
Doremus Gymnasium.”’ read the editorial.

While many of students’ concerns have remained the
same, many others have changed. One 1959 front page
story was headlined ‘‘All freshmen warned about
beanies.”’

“Freshmen will not be granted permission to remove
their beanies at the Homecoming game this year, unless
some of them begin to show respect for the age-old W&L
beanie tradition, according to Rich Aberson, Chairman of
the Assimilation Committee.’

Freshmen wore their beanies until the Homecoming
game and were allowed to remove them after the game
only if W&L was victorious, according to the article. Ap-
parently, some freshmen were seen at the previous foot-
ball game without their beanies. There was no later men-
tion of the success of this threat.

Year round Coca-Cola

The early advertisements perhaps best show the
changes that have occurred since the Phi’s first issues.

“Dropsy cured with vegatable remedies. Have cured
many thousands of cases called hopeless,” read one ad.

“Williams, The Students’ Barber,” promised ‘‘every-
thing strictly first class, a clean towel with every shave.’

Gorrel’s Pharmacy advertised ‘Coca Cola all through
winter” and the local utility company’s advertisements
said Lexington had 68 telephones.

One ad read: “Found—Saturday morning in front of
Dr. Howe’s, a shoe, number 3 1-2 C. Having a long tongue
it is supposed to be of feminine gender — Gen. R.E.M.”’

Although that last ad was from the early 1900s, it
wouldn’t look too out of place in today’s Phi. Maybe
things haven’t changed as much as we sometimes think.

Infirmary has new M.D.

 

By Cecily Tynan
Staff Reporter

 

New faces, new hours and a grow-
ing concern with AIDS mark some of
the changes at the Student Health
Center this year.

The biggest change is the addition
of Dr. Jane Horton-Marcella to the
staff of University physicians. Last
year, with the retirement of Student
Health Director Dr. Fredrick Fed-
deman, the University’s Student
Health Committee was faced with the
task of finding a new physician. As
chairman of the Student Health Com-
mittee, Dean of Students Lewis G.
John pointed out ‘‘there was a desire
for a female doctor.”

After “extensive evaluation,”
Horton-Marcella proved most apt for
the job. Horton-Marcella’s record
shows many qualifications.

She attended Dartmouth Universi-
ty for her undergraduate studies and,
after completing medical school at
the University of Vermont, spent one
year of graduate studies at Cornell
working in student health.

Horton-Marcella said this year pro-
vided her with a lot of experience and
showed her that ‘student health is
the area in which I want to work.”

Then she spent a three-year intern-
ship and residence at the University
of Virginia Hospital, specializing in
internal medicine.

In June 1986, Horton-Marcella
moved to Lexington with her hus-

band, veterinarian Kenneth
Marcella. Here she opened a private
practice with a local physician.

After being a student in the third
class of women at Dartmouth, Hor-
ton-Marcella said she understands
the changes and demands on a
university when it first goes coed.
She feels it is ‘important that W&L
recognize the changing needs”’ and is
“looking forward to developing
special interests in health care for
women.”

Other changes at the Health Center
include new doctors’ hours. The doc-
tor will be available at the center
from 8-10 a.m. and from 4-6 p.m.

Unlike former years, there will be
no doctors’ hours during the
weekends. The doctor will, however,
make regular visits to those students
recuperating in the 12-bed infirmary.

In addition, an examination room
has been moved to accommodate a
new office and a door has been added
to reduce noise.

Keeping up with current health
concerns, the committee will also be
investigating an AIDS-testing policy.
As new Student Health Director Dr.
Robert M. Pickral comments, ‘“‘At
this point W&L is not screening ap-
plicants for the AIDS virus and the
University has not formulated a
policy as of yet, although we are
planning [to formulate a policy] in
the near future. Information on AIDS
is, however, available [in the Student
Health Center] since we do feel it
necessary to educate students about
AIDS.”

Lexington case reaches Supreme Court

 

By Marguerite Ayers
Staff Reporter

 

A rape case decided in 1984 by jury
trial in the Rockbridge County Cir-
cuit Court ascended the ladder to the
United States Supreme Court, only to
find itself in a hearing Thursday in
the same court where it began.

Daniel R. Tinsley was found guilty
on February 9, 1984, and sentenced to
50 years in prison for the rape of a
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College
student in a Lexington fraternity
house on September 15, 1983.

The case was denied appeal by the
Virginia State Court and went to the

The Washington and Lee Universi-
ty Concert Guild opens its season
Thursday, Oct. 1, with the Roxbury
Chamber Players and Max Lifchitz,
pianist. The concert will be at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel on the W&L campus.

The program will consist of music
by living Virginia composers who are
members of The American Compos-
ers Alliance, which is celebrating its
50th anniversary. Works by Judith
Shatin Allen, Jael Eric Suben,
Johann Franco, Robert Stewart, and
Allan Blank will be performed.

Lifchitz is a graduate of The
Juilliard School and Harvard. His
compositions have been performed
throughout the United States, Latin
America and Europe. As a pianist, he
was awarded the first prize in the
1976 Gaudeamus Competition held in
Holland. His works are available on
the CRI, Finnadar and Opus One
record labels.

Allen, whose work Gazebo Music for
flute and cello will be performed,
teaches at the University of Virginia.
She holds a Ph.D. from Princeton,
M.M. from the Juilliard School of

returned to the Virginia Supreme
Court, affirmed, and sent to the Cir-
cuit Court system. The circular path
of the case through the courts was
caused by a landmark decision in
Kentucky that altered the nature of
Tinsley’s appeal.

Tinsley’s case was before the
Virginia Supreme Court when the
Batson vs. Kentucky case was decid-
ed in 1986 and caused the affirmation
of Tinsley’s appeal, due to a question
raised on the appointment of jurors
for his trail.

Supreme Court Justice Lewis
Powell gave the majority opinion on
the Batson case, which ruled that
potential jurors could not be struck
by the prosecuting attorney for pure-

ly racial reasons in cases with racial
undertones.

The Batson case reversed a 1965
decision, Swain vs. Alabama, which
ruled that ina potentially racial case,
it was lawful for the prosecuting at-
torney to strike jurors for whatever
reasons he saw fit as long as there
was no established pattern of racial
discrimination in jury selection.

Judge George E. Honts III, presid-
ed over a three hour hearing Thurs-
day to determine if former Com-
monwealth’s Attorney John Read,
the prosecutor in Tinsley’s case, was
guilty of discriminatory practice

member of the American Composers
Alliance almost from its inception in
the early 1940s. Though Franco has

Also new to the Career Center is
the ‘‘Credential Service,”’ which is a
folder that all seniors will have. This
folder will contain resumes and perti-
nent information on the student for
use in recruitment. The recruitment

system has also been slightly altered.
In on-campus recruitment, where a
representative of a company visits
the campus, ‘‘students can no longer
just sign up for a recruitment date,”’
Heatley said. Now they need to come
in and set up their credential file, and
sign up through him, to help both the
recruiter and the student keep things
more organized. Be also said that he
wants to concentrate more on off-
campus recruiment, where he helps
train students and assists them in
finding a job in the field in which they
would like to work.

The Career Center also assists in
helping undergrads find an intern-
ship program for the summer or
other periods of time.

“Internships offer an avenue to
clarify career objectives and give
job-related experience,” which is
often crucial in finding a job later in
many liberal arts fields, reads the
Career Office’s last newsletter.

“If there is one message I need to
get to the students,” said Heatley, “‘it
is ‘soon.’ I know that things are busy
here now, but careers are perma-
nent.”’

Work begins on convention

 

By Pat Heffernan
Staff Reporter

 

While the 1988 Mock Convention
doesn’t culminate until March 28 and
29, work has already begun for
everyone involved.

The primary task for the directors,
said co-director Lester Coe, is to
balance the convention’s $100,000
budget.

The directors also are trying to ar-
range five speakers for later in the
academic year, closer to convention
time. They hope that at least one of
the speakers will be one of the front-
running candidates.

Work begins soon on researching
the individual states.
chairmen must determine how the
people living in their assigned state
would vote, and inform the delegates
of which candidate to choose at the
convention, said Coe.

There are three state chairmen
spots open to freshmen.

Coe encouraged freshmen and up-
perclassmen to get involved with the
convention. Coe said it is the biggest
event of the academic year both for
the school and Lexington.

Admissions office moves to new location

 

by Christie Champlie
Staff Reporter

 

The admissions office of
Washington & Lee University, now
housed in Washington Hall, is
scheduled to move to 32 University
Place on Sept. 29.

The move will give the office many
advantages not available now and
will provide an aesthetically pleasing
place to work, said assistant admis-
sions director Mimi Milner Elrod. At
present the admissions office does
not have the space or privacy for the
staff and secretaries that the new
house possesses, said Elrod. In terms
of logistics the renovated house will

# incorporate a better division and use

F4 of space, she added.

The Admissions Office’s new home.

The new house will offer easier ac-
cess for visiting prospective students

and their parents since there will be a
site reserved for visitor parking.
Another advantage of the new facili-
ty is that it will give visitors a chance
to see the inside of a house on the
front campus.

The house was originally built in
1941-2. It was used to house faculty
members until 1972, when it became
offices for the religion and classics
department. The house was vacant
since 1981.

’

The new admissions house will be
named for Dean Frank J. Gilliam,
who served as the first dean of
students at W&L. Gilliam worked at
the University for fifty years. He was
an undergraduate student here in
1913, and graduated in 1917. After
graduating, Gilliam served in the
military for one year, taught for a
year at Augusta Military Academy,
and held the position of director of

North Carolina Dance Theatre kicks off series

 

From Staff Reports

 

Great entertainment is coming
your way this year at no charge to
you. Because Washington and Lee
University is a major contributor to
the Rockbridge Concert-Theatre
Series, W&L undergraduate and law
students may attend the following
professional performances just by
showing their student I.D. cards at
the door.

The schedule of events begins Oc-
tober 4 at 2:30 p.m. with the North
Carolina Dance Theater at Lexington
High School, followed by the Amherst
Saxophone Quartet on October 28 at
8:00 p.m. in Chandler Hall at
Southern Seminary Junior College, 4
Child's Christmas in Wales on
December 6 at 2:30 p.m. at Lexington
High School, The Boys Choir of
Harlem on January 31 at 2:30 p.m. in
Jackson Memorial Hall at Virginia
Military Institute, and the Ellis Mar-
salis Quartet on March 23 at 8:00
p.m. in Lee Chapel.

In Paris, the North Carolina Dance
Theater was proclaimed ‘“‘superb....
sufficiently armed to conquer the
world’? by Le Figaro. The North
Carolina Dance Theater’s arsenal is
its diverse repertoire and the ver-
satility of its 18 dancers. Its members
perform a complete spectrum of
dance styles from ballet to modern
dance. Salvatore Aiello, the N.C.D.T.
artistic director, spoke en-
thusiastically of the varied program
they will pertorm in Lexington to
“especially beautiful music of Pro-
kofiev, Chopin and Ravel.”

The Amherst Saxophone Quartet,
equally at home at Carnegie Hall or
the Kool Jazz Festival, offers a mix
of classical chamber music and jazz
with a liberal dose of humor in be-
tween. The unique qualities of the
soprano, alto, tenor and baritone sax-
ophones will be revealed in a pro-
gram that ranges from Bach to the
quartet’s trademark Eubie Blake
rags.

With A Child’s Christmas in Wales,
poet Dylan Thomas captivated aud-
iences with his fond rememberance
of a traditional, often comical, Welsh
Christmas in the 1920’s. Through the
imaginative eyes of a child, this new
musical brings to life the wonders
and beauty of Christmas with old-
fashioned carols, sledding adven-
tures and larger-than-life char-
acters. It is a celebration of life and
the camaraderie of family and
friends — just the thing to get young
and old alike into the holiday spirit.

The Boys Choir of Harlem, ‘‘ex-
pertly guided by Walter J. Turnbull,
is one of the finest groups of its kind,
splendidly disciplined in tone quality,
percision, balance and intonation”

praised the New York Times. The 34 ~

members extend beyond the tradi-
tional soprano choir to include
teenage tenors and basses as well as
trebles. Their full range is skillfully
displayed as they perform the
classics, contemporary, gospel,
spirituals, jazz and more.

Ellis Marsalis, jazz pianist, com-
poser and educator, will perform
with his trio the richly harmonized
arrangements that are his signature.

Peer counseling in 2nd year

 

by Ed Christian
Staff Reporter

 

After a successful first round, the
peer counselor program begins its
second year at Washington and Lee.

Headed by University Psychologist
James Worth, the peer counseling
program began last January. The
program is designed to help students
who need someone to talk to, but
would not feel comfortable going to a
university psychologist.

The Peer Counselors are a group of
students that have been trained in
such areas as alcohol and drug
abuse, listening skills, and emotional
support. The names and telephone
numbers of these counselors will be
posted in numerous places around
the campus. A student may call a
counselor and ask to meet with him.

However, after two or three
meetings, it is suggested that the stu-
dent see a professional.

To become a peer counselor a stu-
dent must first contact Dr. Worth or

Carol Caulkins. Then, an application
is filled out, followed by an interview
and finally a training session.

The training session deals with
listening skills, learning facts about
alcohol and drugs, being able to
recognize signs of certain problems,
skills in communication and, in order
to help others, a peer counselor must
have a certain amount of self aware-
ness.

According to Dr. Worth, the most
important aspects of a_ peer
counselor are the abilities to listen
and understand problems, and to pro-
vide an accurate referral.

Peer Counselors is still a budding
program. All sixteen counselors last
year had some sort of contact with a
troubled student, but the acceptance
of the student body is still
undetermined.

Dr. Worth says it will take at least
two years to determine if the peer
counseling program will be a success
at Washington and Lee. The program
has not yet begun for this year, but
Dr. Worth hopes to begin by early Oc-
tober.

1987 Graduate assaulted

 

From Staff Reports

 

Early on Sept. 5, class of ‘87
graduate John G. Koedel was struck
in the face by a crowbar or tire iron
while walking from the Stop-In on
North Main Street toward Randolph
Street, according to police reports.

No suspects have been arrested.

“All I remember is walking along
by the laundromat, getting hit, then
lying on the ground with him stand-
ing above me, saying, ‘What did you
do to her?,’ ” said Koedel.

Koedel explained that while he was
in the Stop-In parking lot, a man ina
blue car pulled up and called him
over. The man told Koedel that he
had been on his hall freshman year at
W&L, but Koedel told the man he
didn’t know him.

‘‘He said he knew me, but I had no
idea who he was,” said Koedel.

Koedel then went into Stop-In,
made a purchase, and spoke with the
girl at the cashier’s counter about
what had happened outside. He said
she laughed about the incident and
they spoke briefly before he left.

Walking toward Randolph Street,
Koedel was attacked by the man he
had seen at Stop-In. He described the
suspect as white, in his 20s, with light
brown hair and a large tattoo of a
spider on his left shoulder.

“He hit me square in the teeth; he

chipped three and knocked out three
and spilt my lip,’’ Koedel said.

Koedel said he had always thought
he was safe in Lexington, and was
overwhelmed by what had happened.

“T walked around that way my four
years at W&L and I would tell anyone
now, don’t walk around alone,
especially on side streets,’’ he said.

Lexington Chief of Police Bruce M.
Beard Jr. said the case is still being
investigated.

“Suspects have been interviewed,”
Beard said, ‘‘with no results.”

Leads are being checked on blue
vehicles, but the license plate
number is unknown.

Koedel said a new lead is currently
being pursued that involves a VMI
graduate who knows of a man witha
spider tattoo.

Beard commented that student
assaults have been ‘‘very rare’ in
Lexington and that there is no pat-
tern of such instances.

Koedel speculated that the man
may have been jealous of the conver-
sation he had with the girl at Stop-In,
but he thinks there is an overall
animosity toward college students
from some of the local residents.

“T think they do it just to college
students,’’ he said, referring to
similar instances in the past.

“It’s a shame,” said Beard, ‘‘He
had teeth knocked out, and I just
hope they can be transplanted.”’

 

Trial

 

O Continued from Page 4

black was struck from the panel
because he thought the man worked
at a neighboring fraternity from
where the incident took place.

Tinsley’s attorney, Malcolm G.
Crawford, said his client is entitled to
another trial.

Judge Honts commented that the
Batson decision may cause a flood of
cases with racial undertones to reap-
pear in court. ‘‘I can see the scenario
of a case tried 15 years ago coming

back to court. But the Supreme Court
is the final arbiter of th@se things,”
said Honts.

No decision was reachéd in the
hearing, according to Clerk of the
Court Bruce Patterson, who com-
mented that the case had become
complex.

The case will be decided following
the submission of a brief within ten
days by Crawford, followed by a
response within seven days by the
present Lexington and Rockbridge
Commonwealth’s Attorney, Eric Lee
Sisler.

Judge Honts said he would be
prompt in closing the book on the 1984
case following a review of the briefs.

Gilliam returned to W&L in 1926.
He remained here until his death in
1976. Gilliam held the office of Dean
of Students from the time of its crea-
tion in 1932 until his retirement from
it in 1962. After retiring he served as
Dean Emeritus until his death.

The renovation of the new admis-

sions house was assisted by a dona-
tion of $250,000 from the class of 1961.
The donation was to commemorate
the 25th anniversary of the gradua-
tion of the class. The chairman of the
reunion committee was William R.
Johnson. ‘Honoring the memory of
Dean Gilliam was our objective from
the very start because he had such a
profound effect on our lives,” said
Johnson.

After a weekend off, the
Washington and Lee football Gen-
rals will be trying for their first win
{ the season against the College Col-
onels, the 14th-ranked team in Divi-
sion IIL pre-season polls and a team
ith 15 returning starters.

The Generals suffered one of their
ughest losses of the 1986 season to

the Colonels. After a long trip to Dan-
ville, Kentucky, W&L was shut out
through most of the game until
tailback Kevin Weaver scored on a
one-yard carry with only 1:10 re-
maining. The Generals went for two
on the conversion, but quarterback
Jon Thornton’s pass fell incomplete,
and the Generals were sent home
with their second loss in as many
games.

lacrosse star Redfern
transfers to Chapel Hill

By Jim Lake
staff Reporter

 

One of Washington and Lee’s
lacrosse standouts last season is now
attending classes at the University of

Vorth Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Neill Redfern, a sophomore at
Washington and Lee in 1986-87, of-
ficially withdrew from W&L on July
24, according to University Registrar
scott Dittman.

After recording 42 goals and 32
\ssists for the 1987 Generals, Redfern
is now playing fall lacrosse for the
‘Tar Heels and will be eligible for the
1988 season.

In a telephone interview with the
Roanoke Times & World News, Red-
fern said his decision to withdraw
wasn’t based solely on athletics. ‘‘It
wasn’t strictly a lacrosse decision. I
just wanted to go to school’’ at Chapel
Hill, said Redfern.

‘Members of my family have been
going to Carolina forever, but I
couldn't have played lacrosse [at
UNC] right out of high school,” ex-
plained Redfern. “ I'm really taking

 

a risk to come here now, but it really
is worth it tome.”

A member of the 1987 Old Domin-
ion All-Conference team and the
Generals’ team leader in goals
scored last season, Redfern said ‘‘I
felt like I’d already proven myself at
Division III.’’ However, Redfern said
W&L’s switch from Division I to Divi-
sion III in lacrosse after the 1986
season ‘‘had nothing to do with’’ his
decision to transfer.

When contacted by The Ring-tum
Phi, Redfern refused to comment.

W&L head coach Dennis Daly told
the Roanoke paper that Washington
and Lee provided Redfern with a
waiver that will allow him to play
this year. However, Daly said
Redfern will not be eligible for a
scholarship.

“It didn’t serve us any purpose to
stand in his way,”’ said Daly. ‘I don’t
think it will be a trend. Neill con-
sidered transferring after his fresh-
man year.”

Tim Nelson, an assistant lacrosse
coach at Chapel Hill, told the Phi that
Redfern is a ‘pretty good player”
who will make the team.

by graduation. ‘‘We saw them play
against a pretty good Maryville team
last week,”’ said Fallon, ‘‘and they've
improved in spots where we thought
they might be weaker.”’ The Colonels
racked up nearly 300 yards rushing in
torrential rains and won that game,
6-2.

Fallon pointed to sophomore
quarterback Mark Brown (6-1, 195)
as one of Centre’s best players. New
to the starting position, Fallon said
Brown is nevertheless ‘‘performing
like a veteran.”’

Soccer drops third,
Silva scores twice

 

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team is still having a difficult
time piecing things together after the
third game of the season yesterday
against Mary Washington College.

Having basically the same line-up
as last year, it looks like it could just
take some time before things start
flo.. ‘ag smoothly.

Yesterday afternoon, Mary Wash-
ington arrived at Smith Field only to

leave with a 5-1 victory. The lone
scorer was sophomore Rick Silva.
Ball control was the main problem as
the ball tended to remain on W&L’s
half of the field for the majority of the
game. It was a defensive struggle
from the outset.

One of the team co-captains, senior
Chris Gareis, said that there is ‘‘a lot
of skill on the team.’ The team
started off slowly in the first half, and
was unable to come back from a a 4-1
deficit.

W&L tried changing the field posi-
tioning to generate some offensive
action, but nothing worked. Mary
Washington is a very highly-ranked
team in Division III, and the

Generals have defeated them only
once in the last four years.

Last Saturday, the team suffered
its second loss of the season, bowing
to Greensboro College 2-1. Silva, who
scored the only goal of that game as
well, said, ‘We have the same per-
sonnel as we had last year,”’ and the
team has the potential for even more
talent.

“Something’s missing in the
chemistry of the team,” Silva said,
and the problems just cannot be pin-
pointed yet.

The Generals’ next game will be
Saturday when the team travels to
Maryville to open its Old Dominion
Athletic Conference schedule.

big problems for football

Brown is “capable of running the
ball on options and scrambling when
he has to,”’ said Fallon. ‘As wet as it
was [against Maryville], he threw
the ball with some authority.”

The Colonels’ leading ball carrier
is junior runningback Greg Lawson
(5-11, 195). “I hope we don’t run
across a harder runner than him all
year, because he was just chewing up
Maryville’s defense,”’ said Fallon. In
that game, Lawson carried 31 times
for 186 yards.

The Colonels defense lacks size,
but Fallon said the Colonels really at-

Fallon predicted a passing game if
the weather is good for this
weekend’s home opener. ‘‘We hope to
air the ball out. We’ve got a good
group of receivers, and we feel we
can protect our quarterback,”’ said
Fallon. Overall, the tenth-year head

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team, which earned a No. 19 na-
tional ranking after it won the W&L
Fall Classic a week ago, won two of
three matches last weekend at the
Northeast Varsity Invitational at
Providence, Rhode Island.

The Generals, 6-1 on the season,
lost to Bucknell 12-10, and then beat
Slippery Rock 15-5 and Richmond
10-7.

Although the team had a successful
record, head coach Page Remillard,

was not particularly pleased with the
way the Generals played in the two
WiNS. 44 we- *

“Athletically, we are playing at a
high level, but mentally we are play-
ing at a much lower level,” he said.
“The 2-1 record looks good, but I am
not too excited about our intensity. If
we continue to play without intensity
we will be in for a rude awakening.”

This weekend, W&L will travel to
play in the Virginia State Champion-
ships. The Generals and the Spiders
of Richmond, which has won the title
the last four years, are expected to
reach the finals of that tournament.

Cross country opens at Mary Washington

Freshman key to women’s success

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Two years is not a long period of
time with which to build a winning
program. In fact, after their first two
years of existence, the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers had compiled a stellar
1-27 record in the National Football
League. For the Washington and Lee
women’s cross country team, how-
ever, the road to success has not been
so rough.

Beginning only their third season
of operation on Saturday at Mary
Washington, the Generals seem on
the brink of a winning season. Com-
ing off last season’s 3-6 record and
third-place finish in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference, W&L has its
top harrier returning in junior
Stephanie Smith. Smith, who was
10th in the ODAC championships with
a time of 26 minutes, 42 seconds for
five kilometers, was W&L’s highest

finisher in the South-Southeast
Regional meet (28th, 25:56).

“Everyone's doing a great job,”’
said head coach Jim Phemister. ‘‘We
have five new freshman runners and
I'm really impressed with how hard
they are working.”’

Two of those five freshmen, Page
Cason and Lovell West, will be join-
ing Smith and junior Anne Geary as
the top four runners on the team.
Phemister speculated that the key
fifth spot would probably be filled by
freshman Heather Jenkins.

The most important goal for W&L
is to be competitive in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference. Phemister
said it is too soon to predict which
schools have the best chance to take
the conference title.

“My guess is that both Eastern
Mennonite and Lynchburg are are
going to have good teams once
again,” he said. ‘“‘But none of the
teams have run in meets yet, so it is
too early to tell.”

 

Kurtis Blow would have been proud

Free agency is the main issue here

An idea the owners won’t get near

Look at baseball and basketball, you hear them cry
The salaries there are much to high

In the NFL, the average make 300 grand

That’s a lot of bread to put in anyone’s hand

The owners wonder ‘what do we have to do?

Wash their car? Shine their shoe?’

Everybody say ‘Where’s all the money at?’

 

Here it is! Hot off the presses. The song you’ve all been waiting for

L In the NFL, we got quite a mess

Tain’t talking ’bout Mark Gastineau wearing a dress
The players, you see, are real upset

And the owners don’t want to deal with nobody yet
Gene Upshaw, is the players rep

While Jack Donlan is the owners’ pet

Donlan won’t sit down and try to talk

So Upshaw says ‘it’s time to take the walk’

CHORUS:

Everybody say ‘Where’s all the money at?’
You can’t, you can’t, you can’t do that
Where’s all the money at?

The TV stations would rather show fishing or golf

Then some washed-up bums with first names like ‘Rolf’
Rozelle the commissioner don’t want to get involved
He hopes the union will just dissolve

I'd wish these fellas would see things the same

And remember they’re grown-ups playing a kid’s game

Men have top two runners returning

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

To the Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team, winning seasons
seem almost second nature.

The Generals, coming off their
ninth-consecutive winning cam-
paign, will begin their quest for dou-
ble digits Saturday when the team
travels to Mary Washington for a tri-
meet against the host school and
Washington College.

“The men have worked hard to
build a successful program and have
done very well in the past,”’ said head
coach Dick Miller, whose team
posted a 13-3 record last season. ‘‘I
have been fortunate to have coached
athletes who have motivated them-
selves and have disciplined their
minds and their bodies.”’

Miller has his two top runners
returning in senior co-captains Scott
Rippeon and Richard Moore, both of
whom represented W&L at the NCAA
Division III Championship in 1986.
Rippeon and Moore, as well as since-
graduated Ted Myers, were the key
reasons for the team’s second-
place finish in the Old Dominion

Athletic Conference and third-place
finish in the NCAA South-Southeast
D-III championships. Moore came in
third in the S-SE Regional with a
time of 27 minutes, 25 seconds over
eight kilometers, while Rippeon
followed close behind in fifth place
(27:29).

Looking at the upcoming season,
Miller, who also serves W&L’s
associate athletic director, is so far
pleased with the way his runners
have performed in the early time
trials.

“Most of the boys had stayed or
had gotten into pretty good shape
over the summer,”’ he said. ‘‘They all
ran well.”

Looking at the conference, the
Generals can expect the biggest
challenge to come from Roanoke Col-
lege. The Maroons are the defending
ODAC champions and have been
establishing themselves as a national
power.

“Roanoke will be tough,’’ said
Miller. ‘“‘However, they lost some
people from last year. I wouldn't
even predict anything because a
team can get one or two people and
get wellinahurry.”’

Join a ‘spirit team’ and win

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Washington and Lee promotions
has come up with a way for W&L
students, faculty or staff to engage in
friendly competition while suppor-
ting the school’s athletic teams.

The idea is called the McDonald’s
Generals Spirit Competition and is
sponsored by—you guessed it—
McDonald’s.

“The charge to promotions is to get
more people at the games,’’ said
promotions director Dennis Daly.
“Particularly students, to generate
interest among the students.”’

Here’s how the competition works.
All you have to do is register a team
of 25 (maximum) students, faculty or
staff members and then attend as
many athletic events as you can.

The teams will compete each
athletic season (fall, winter, and

spring) and throughout the academic
year to determine which team has
shown the greatest athletic spirit.
Every time you go to a game, you
sign in and your team receives one
spirit point.

The seasonal champion will
receive coupons for food at
McDonalds and the cumulative win-
ning team at the end of the year will
be awarded McDonald’s General
Spirit Award T-shirts plus an award
winning picnic.

Every athletic event counts equal-
ly so a team receives just as many
points for going to, say a football
game as it would for a women’s soc-
cer game.

“McDonalds] wanted exposure to
all sports,”’ Daly said. ‘They did not
want to be labeled to just one athletic
activity.”

The rosters are due by Tues., Sept.
29, and may be turned in at Daly’s of-
fice located on the 500 level of
Doremus Gym.

The Ring-tum Phi, September 24, 1987

a Bamba destined for gold

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

The summer of 1987 was an ex-
cellent summer for the movies. Old
good guys became new good guys as
Stribek, Friday and Elliot Ness
returned to the screen. Jaws returned
for a fourth feeding, the nerds came
back for a second beating, and a
modern day Cyrano wooed Daryl
Hannah in an updated reading.
Stanley Kubrick came out of the
shadows with Full Metal Jacket,
Bigfoot came out of the woods in
Harry and the Hendersons, and vam-
pires came of of nowhere in The Lost
Boys.

Many films exhibited excellent
qualities this summer, yet, none put
them all together the way the sum-
mer’s best overall film did.

La Bamba is 1987’s finest summer
film. The rags to riches success story
of Mexican-American rocker Ritchie
Valens is the latest chapter of the
most written about tragedy in rock
history (the winter plane crash that
killed Valens, Buddy Holly, and J.R.
“the Big Bopper’ Richardson) and
the finest rock biography to come to
the screen since the Oscar winning
Coal Miner's Daughter.

Director Luis Valdez has done a
beautiful job of putting together
Valens’ story. His incorporation of
Ritchie's nightmares about dying in
a plane crash and the lines fore-
shadowing the ultimate crash give
“La Bamba” a tight coherence. In
addition, Valdez’ direction of Lou
Diamond Phillips in the lead role is
excellent; pulling out of him the
head-strong, determined character
that Valens sings about in ‘‘La Bam-

Trio Familiaris

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

A near capacity crowd filled Lee
Chapel Tuesday night as Professor
Timothy Gaylard, his wife Catharine
Gaylard, and her brother Peter Clark
presented the first concert of the
198788 Washington and Lee academic
year. The ‘Trio Familiaris’’
presented a well-rounded one-and-
one-half hour evening of selections
ranging musically from Mozart to
Gershwin. Mr. Gaylard played piano,
Mrs. Gaylard sang soprano, and
Clark sang tenor and played the
violin.

Though excellent in its entirety, the
concert seemed to gain momentum
as it unfolded. The first selection,
“Non so piu, cosa son” from ‘The
Marriage of Figaro’ by Mozart open-
ed the concert well, but was paled by
the second selection, ‘‘Elegie’’ by
Jules Massenet which blended the
soprano, piano, and violin quite
beautifully.

The performance continued with
sections featuring tenor and piano,
soprano and piano, and finally a third
vocal section featuring Mrs. Gaylard
and Clark in ‘‘Suleika und Hatem”’ by
Fanny Mendelssohn, and ‘‘Herb-
stlied’’ by Felix Mendelssohn with
accompaniment by Mr. Gaylard.
Both pieces were performed with an
excellent vocal blend and touch.

Mr. Gaylard then finished the first
half of the program with a dynamic
performance of Franz Listz’s ‘“‘Wid-
mung’’ whereafter he exited follow-
ing two calls to the stage.

Words In Edgewise

A slice of

By Marshall Boswell
Staff Reporter

 

 

With all due respect to Leonard
Nimoy (who is probably a very fine
actor in his own right), it has always
seemed to me that the part of Spock
on the ‘Star Trek’’ television series
would be one of the easiest parts an
actor could ever play. I mean, think
about it: the character’s basic
premise is that he cannot show emo-
tion. So what is there to act? Just
deliver the lines as dryly as possible
and you got it.

Which is pretty much how I feel
about Bret Easton Ellis’ novels.
Although Ellis displays genuine ver-
bal talent as well as a startling eye
for unconventional, yet appropriate,
detail, the fact remains that there
isn’t a whole hell of a lot to his novels
— no emotion, no insight, no passion,
no character development. As any-
one who’s read Less Than Zero would
testify, that’s precisely the point:
Ellis’ characters are so jaded that
they have no emotion, no insight, and
they never develop into anything
substantial. Which is fine and good
—Ellis might be making one of the
major statements of the Eighties —
but, like Nimoy’s Spock character,
this seems to me like a pretty easy
trick to pull off. Just try writing a
short story in first person in which
the narrator strolls into a fraternity
party, comments on the dress and
background music, gets drunk and
leaves, Every person on this campus
is capable of that.

Ellis’ latest slice of pre-yuppie
nihilism is called The Rules of Attrac-
tion (Simon & Schuster, $17.95), and,
contrary to the overly-enthusiastic
disclaimer on the dust jacket, it is not
“a startling departure from his first
novel.”’ The setting is ‘‘Camden Col-
lege’ (a poorly-disguished fictional
version of Ellis’ own alma mater,
Bennington College) and the “‘plot”’
concerns a typically ‘‘disturbing’’
romantic triangle. First there is
Lauren, a beautiful, confused coed
whose boyfriend, Victor, is in
Europe. Next there is Sean (the
10vel’s most developed character),
whose passion is booze, dope and
?ole Position and who, through some
nistakenly attributed love notes,
inds himself in love with Lauren.
vast there is Paul, the novel’s bisex-
‘al realist who paradoxically has or

se EP RAE PSIA

The second half began just as the
first half had finished. Clark and
Gaylard played ‘‘Sonatensatz,” an
intensely beautiful duet for violin and
piano by Brahms that proved to be
the finest performance of the even-
ing.

Gaylard then performed ‘The Cat
and the Mouse’’ by Aaron Copland,
and ‘Prelude Number 3” by George
Gershwin which were both excellent.
As with any accomplished pianist, it
was amazing to watch the precision
and ease with which Gaylard moved
around the keys of the chapel grand
piano.

Two sections of piano with soprano
and tenor featuring the works of
Tosti, Poulenc, Faure, and Satie

    

ba” “Yo no soy marinero, soy
capitan!”’ (I’m not a sailor, I’m the
captain!)

The film is well-shot and also well-
written. Newcomer Phillips does a
good job as Valens and an excellent
job of lip-synching the music.
Veteran actress Rosana DeSoto is
fantastic as Valens’ mother as is
Elizabeth Pena as his sister-in-law.
There are, however, two things about
La Bamba that stand out in ex-
cellence. :

Esai Morales will receive an
Academy Award nomination for his
performance as Valens’ brother Bob.
His performance as the Jekyll and
Hyde jealous brother was the finest
performance of the summer and will
be included as one of the five best of
the year come March.

The second thing about La Bamba
that is four star is its soundtrack. Los

plays tochape

followed setting up the final trio per-
formances for the finale. Throughout
the performance it seemed that each
selection was better than the one
before it, culminating with the final
piece, ‘Contentment’ by Arthur
Goring Thomas that was indeed, the
finest trio performance of the con-
cert. The blend between Mrs.
Gaylard and Clark was both clear
and Beautiful.

All in all, it was a wonderful even-
ing of music and a wonderful start to
the Washington and Lee Concert
year.

Other performances to watch for in
the coming weeks include: Thurs-

posers Alliance Concert with the

Trio Familiaris — Gaylard, Gaylard, and Clark,

pre-yuppie nihilism

imagines he has an affair with Sean
and who once did seem to have had a
fling with Lauren. There is no central
narrator, but Ellis rather employs a
system Faulkner used in 4s I Lay Dy-
ing whereby the characters take
turns narrating the events.

Ellis handles his chosen technique
well, presenting the same events
from two and sometimes three amus-
ingly different points of view. The
narrative structure is central to the
theme suggested in the title, as well:
Part of the “rules of attraction” is
that no one is really allowed to con-
nect. This multiple narrator struc-
ture allows Ellis to suggest a world
where characters meet and converse
and fornicate and slip away but
never lend themselves to each other;
anybody’s point of view is as valid as
the next. We never know if Paul and
Sean truly ‘‘connect’’: Paul
describes the affair in seat-
squirming detail, but Sean never
acknowledges a thing. Who's telling
the truth? In one of the few instances
of real ‘‘development,”’ Ellis
manages to sway the reader’s trust
away from the shallow yet ultimately
romantic Sean and over to the sharp-
eyed and caring Paul.

But basically, that’s it. Ellis’ chief
literary device is the run-on sen-
tence. His stream-of-consciousness is
pale and poorly developed, showing
every indication that it is usually the
author’s ‘“‘stream’’ and not his
characters’. He never bothers to
develop any metaphoric or symbolic
depth but rather lets various rock
songs (which he assumes, probably
correctly, that his audience has
heard) serve as the novel's reoccurr-
ing metaphors.

Lauren is supposed to be the most
complex character in the romantic
triad but comes off as the most two-
dimensional, and this is Ellis’ fault:
his idea of depth is to have the
character be sincerely in love (near-
ly every one of Lauren’s sections in
the first half of the book opens with
the sentence, ‘‘Victor hasn’t called’)
and have her write poetry. Sean is
Ellis’ best-developed character
Simply because he is the most
shallow. He thinks Lauren’s poetry
“doesn’t make sense,” so. pre-
occupied is it with girls sitting
around complaining about absent
boyfriends and menstrual periods.
Sean’s dismissal of Lauren's poetry

has broader inipiucations as well

since his description of it pretty
much describes Ellis’ book. In fact;
The Rules of Attraction turns on itself
at one point when Ellis has a un-
favorably potrayed “‘literary type”
pose the following question:

“But...let me ask you, don't you think
that the admittedly outlaw scribblings
of these wasted post-lietnam, post-
Watergate. post-... well, post everything
minstrels, is the product of a literary
establishment bombasting a lost
generation with worthless propaganda
exploiting greed, blased sexual at-
titudes and mind corrupting, numbing
jejunosity and that’s why works like
[Expletive], a searing, searing collec-
tion of quote-unquote underground
writing, becomes potent figures on the
minds of this clan of maladjusted,
nihilistic, malcontent, self-serving...
well, hell, miscarriages, or do you think
it’s all. bogus?” (p. 198)

By putting this passage in his book,
Ellis makes a snotty-nosed wink to
all his supporters: ‘‘Aren’t I clever? I
know what they’re all saying about
me, and don’t they sound ridicu-
lous?’’ But after finishing the novel,
one is still tempted to say, ‘‘Yes, it is
all bogus,”’ to which Ellis can simply
answer, ‘‘I knew you'd say that, you
fool.’’ He even brings back Clay, the
jaded narrator of Less The Zero, for
an ill-advised cameo appearance in
which Ellis parodies himself and
both of his novels by having Caly
observe, “People are afraid to merge

on campus after midnight” — an
almost exact echo of Less Than Zero’s
opening sentences, ‘People are

afraid to merge on freeways in Los
Angeles.”’ All of this self-refrence
and self-ridicule is irritating and
maddening and displays, above and
beyond everything else, that Ellis
has a distorted view of his own im-
portance. He’s a mildly talented
young writer: where does he get off
thinking he’s James Joyce?

The Rules of Attraction is technical-
ly better than Less Than Zero, but
literary worth was never the issue
with that book: the issue there was
shock value. Ellis’ gimmick is wear-
ing thin. Basically I think the guy
was simply published too early for
his own good. By now, unfortunately,
it might be too late.

Lobos has done a phenomenal job of
recording Valens’ hit records. The
originals were in such poor condition
that they could not be used for the
film ‘“‘La Bamba.” “Come on Let’s
Go,” and ‘‘Donna,”’ Valens’ three
biggest hits, highlight the first side of
the soundtrack with Marshall Cren-
shaw and Bo Diddley helping out the
Lobos on the ‘‘B”’ side. Though not on
the soundtrack, Carlos Santana and
Miles Goodman also contributed
original music to the film.

La Bamba is a film that should not
be missed. Just as The Buddy Holly
Story pointed out what a tragedy the
death of Buddy Holly was, La Bamba
does the same for Ricardo Valen-
zuela — Ritchie Valens. It is an in-
tense, touching film that will forever
remind us of the loss we suffered
“the day the music died.”

Music Critic

 

Introducing SCRAM!, a band that
you’ve probably never heard of, but
one that you really should get to
know. SCRAM! consists of 2 brothers
(Matt and Greg Mungen, handling
vocals and guitar) with Craig Heim
on drums. Be open-minded and look

past this band’s silly, sort of sub-
stellar name and give them a listen.
What you're going to hear is a white-
American version of strongly reggae-
inspired socially conscious lyrics
with a generally uptempo feel-
progressive music flavored by reg-
gae but definitely not overwhelmed
by it. They’re reminiscent of a muted
General Public Ip, but without the ac-
cent. SCRAM! just released their

first album named Stand Up which
entered the college charts at No. 95
with the promise of moving up swift-
ly as it gains more exposure. It’s
been getting better than moderate
rotation at WLUR.

The ist three songs on the front
side, ‘‘Here tonite,’ “Freedom,” and
“Our World” are rather unpolished
and simple (it is only their ist album)
yet they appealingly get their
message across. The band seems
wholly sympathetic to the plight of
black South Africans as the lyrics
and titles of the songs more than
‘subtly suggest. However, SCRAM!
doesn’t make the listener nauseous
with goody-goody anti-apartheid sen-

the music is flavored by that sen-
timentality, yet not overwhelmed by
it. “Something to Cling to” is essen-

»  Wé&L has a visiting student from
. Oxford University this year Kate

» Peppiatt.

Peppiatt has just received her
degree in English from Oxford’s
+ University College. She chose to par-

ticipate in the program because of
* the scholarship that W&L offers
directly through Oxford.

She says that the year of
. study, ‘... suits me really well

because I don’t want to go into long-

* term academia.”
Peppiatt finds courses at W&L to

be very different from those in
y England. At Oxford, only one course
is taken per term, and they are
* taught through a “...one-on-one
tutorial system, which involves much
more studying on your own. There

+ arehardly any classes.”
At W&L she says that there are
» many more lectures, ‘‘and I'm not
sure if this is really fair, but the pro-
fessors seem much more accessible

» ... there is much more care taken of
you here.”’

“Hey, are you closing? Are you
bankrupt?’”’

“People often mistake smallness
for weakness,’ added Thornton.
“[ZBT] is a small house, but a viable
house. The national representative
called us a model fraternity.”

Thornton said the worst part about
the rumors that ZBT was closing was
that they are untrue.

“Nothing could be farther from the
truth. People at other fraternity
houses were telling freshmen, ‘Why
are you at ZBT? They’re folding.’”’

Delta Tau Delta has also been vic-
timized by rumors that they are clos-
ing, since the house did not par-
ticipate in Rush this year.

Rush sanctions were imposed on

Delta Tau Delta after an incoming
freshman was seriously injured in an
automobile accident following a
Delta Tau Delta Rush party in
Maryland.

Delta Tau Delta President Kevin
Webb declined to comment due to ad-
vice from his lawyer, but ina letter to
last week’s Ring-tum Phi Webb
dispeled any rumors of the fraterni-
ty’s demise.

“We would like to make it clear
that the Delt house does currently ex-
ist as a fraternity and will continue to
exist as such on the W&L campus.
Although our Rush activities were
cancelled due to the sanctions, we
are still affiliated with our national
fraternity and have received their
full support in this difficult period.”

Besides the temporary damage to
ZBT and DTD’s reputations, there
have been other consequences.

Thornton and ZBT treasurer Greg
Bonn acknowledged that the rumors
hurt them in obtaining pledges. ZBT
currently has 4.

“We know of one case where,
because of the rumors, a freshmen
decided to wait before pledging
ZBT,”’ said Thornton.

‘People were a lot more reluctant
to come out to the house,” added
Bonn, acknowledging that freshmen
were likely to rule out rushing a cer-
tain fraternity if there is any doubt
about its future.

vious that the rumors were in cir-

Michael Longshore, W&L’s first
Oxford University exchange student,
has returned with a variety of stories
and observations, from his ex-
perience.

Longshore was chosen to par-
ticipate in the program after being
nominated by the English depart-
ment, writing essays, and being in-
terviewed by various W&L admin-

istrators.
An English/French major,
Longshore’ studied Victorian,

Modern, and Romantic literature at
Oxford.

He explained that students at Ox-
ford do not necessarily take ‘‘struc-
tured’ courses as at American
universities. Instead, most of the day
is spent doing independent study.

Longshore would meet on a weekly
basis with a tutor to read and discuss
his papers. These meetings required,
“* a great deal of confidence and
humility. You would read your own
paper to the tutor one on one.”

He recalls one particularly
stressful situation when after
reading the first paragraph of an
essay, his tutor questioned the main
point of his paper. Longshore noted,
however, that, ‘‘when he (the tutor)

By David Emrich

Yesterday, the Student Affairs

Committee confirmed the
punishments of four fraternities —
Chi Psi, Phi Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa
Phi and Sigma Phi Epsilon — for
violations of Inter-Fraternity Council
regulations.

The punishments were originally
handed out at the Sept. 23 meeting of
the IFC’s Judicial Board but had to
be approved by the SAC.

According to Associate Dean of
Students Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins,
the punishments were as follows:

Sigma Phi Epsilon received the
harshest punishment. They were
given four weeks of Social Probation

_ for a Sept. 19 noise violation and

because the IFC” deterininéd the
house’s party of the same date was
out of control.

According to Atkins the IFC came
to the decision that the party was out
of control from the police reports and
the admission of several house of-
ficers who said they weren’t around
to control the party.

‘Fraternity rumors are untrue; Delt and ZBT are alive and

up for open houses, because of the
reluctance of freshmen to sign up.

“I'd heard that people were saying
the two of us (ZBT and DTD) were
gone,”’ Thornton said. ‘Our (ZBT)
national representatives are op-
timistic and we are optimistic about
the future.”

Thornton said that ZBT’s finances
are solvent and that as long as there
is one member of ZBT at the W&L
campus, ZBT will continue to exist.

Thornton added that the ZBT
rumors even managed to get back to
Dean of Fraternities Leroy C. Buddy
Atkins and the Interfraternity Coun-
cil, both of whom questioned Thorn-
ton about the allegations.

“Dean Atkins didn’t put too much
credence in the rumors, but he did

houses

Sigma Phi Epsilon President
Maverick Noble said the incident oc-
cured after the person in charge of
the party had shut it down and gone
home.

“Tt was unfortunate because a few
individuals messed things up for the
whole house.”

Sig Ep appealed the original deci-
sion by the IFC so their social proba-
tion began yesterday.

“Obviously we thought the punish-
ment was too harsh or we wouldn’t
have appealed the decision,’ said
Noble.

“But they make the rules, we have
tolive by them.”

Phi Kappa Sigma was also severly
punished.

Phi Kap was found guilty of serv-
ing hard alcohol at a rush party and
was fined $1000 and given two weeks
of social probation.

This was Phi Kap’s second viola-
tion of rush regulations. Had there
been a third violation, they would
have had their rush priveledges
suspende for a year. There is,
however, no danger of this occuring

want to know what was going on,”
said Thornton.

This is not the first instance of a
rumor causing harm to ZBT. Thorn-
ton said last year, a professor made
an off-hand comment concerning
drug use at ZBT during one of his lec-
tures.

Although Thornton said the faculty
member later made a_ formal
apology, the comment did cause
some damage to ZBT’s reputation,
according to Thornton.

“His comment, which was
overheard by a fraternity member
during class, was ‘When they close
ZBT down they’re going to run the
drug dogs through the house and

Longshore emphasizes the vast
degree of knowledge of the tutors, or
“dons.”

‘They are some of the most erudite
people that I’ve ever come across.

OPINION
Beauty?

Parking at Washington and Lee, as noted in last week’s edi-
tion of The Ring-tum Phi, is quite a formidable undertaking
for students. Everyone seems to be saying that there is not
enough available space, but it does not seem that very much
has been done about it, except throwing around wonderful
‘ideas’, such as a parking garage, that will take a long time
to build.

There are some easier options that should not be as.expen-
sive or time-consuming. For example, it has been suggested
that the ‘‘corral’’, the parking lot at the bottom of the hill, be
enlarged so more cars can fit. However, as University Proc-
tor Charles ‘‘Murph’’ Murphy said last week, the university
architects do not want the corral to look like the parking lot at
a shopping center.

However, the corrals ‘‘beautiful’’ design frequently looks
like the aftermath of the World of Wheels Bigfoot Truck Car
Smashing show. All the landscaping is for naught as
students, who have paid to park in the lot, are forced to park
over the curbs and on the grass. Mix in a little rain for spice,
and there is enough mud to make any pig happy.

Also, the brilliantly placed wooden parking obstacles not
only restrict access, they are a danger to any car larger than
a go-cart. With all the double and triple parking, it is all too
easy to catch a door on the wood, or worse, another car. Why
should students have to pay a parking fee just to endanger
their cars?

Surely there is an architect who can figure a way to enlarge
the corral without having it look like the Washington and Lee
Discount Mall. Perhaps take out the trees and surround the
lot with hedges.

Increased parking would not only help the students, it
would take a lot of the parking load off the city of Lexington.
The University must remember they have an obligation not
to unduly infringe upon the community at large.

Not here

Every year the same old subject reappears at Washington
and Lee: student apathy. Either people are upset because no
one came to a prominent speaker, a seminar was cancelled
due to lack of interest or everyone left after halftime at the
Homecoming football game.

W&L students seem to have a knack for not attending

‘athletic events. A quick look at the stands shows a glaring
lack of members of the student body. Of course, at past
Homecomings the stands are always filled during the second
quarter, but as soon as the queen is crowned (and kissed as
only Professor Shillington can) there is a mass exodus to the
nearest cocktail party.

Perhaps the only things students can muster the ambition
to attend are fraternity parties (and perhaps classes, if the
weekend wasn’t too rough). There is nothing wrong with par-
ties, and they definitely have a place in university life.

But what about athletic events? All the teams at W&L work
exceedingly hard at their respective sports, which is amaz-
ing since none of the players receive scholarships for their
participation. It would be great if the students would give
support to those athlete-scholars by bringing some spirit (as
well as themselves) to games.

Not only does apathy indirectly insult the players, it puts
the university in a bad light. It is embarassing to see a pic-
ture of the W&L football team playing with near-empty
stands in the background. Those photos do not paint a very
enthusiastic picture of the university.

All the students should try this at the next football game:
instead of asking around to find out the final score, stay for
the entire game. Although the stands are not lined with kegs,
it is a social atmosphere. Move around, talk to friends. And
most of all cheer for the team; they deserve it.

 

CORRECTION

In last week’s Ring-tum Phi there was an error in the
letter from Delta Tau Delta President Kevin Webb. The
last lines should have read, ‘‘Although our rush activities
were cancelled due to the sanction, we are still affiliated
with our national fraternity and have received their full
support in the difficult period. And with their assistance
we plan to appeal the decision next term. In conclusion,
we would like to thank all of the fraternities at W&L for
| their wupport for it is greatly appreciated.”

Organizations are not autonomous

 

MY VIEW
By Frank Watson

 

When deciding to attend W&L, I
was heavily influenced by the tradi-
tion that the school offered: I ad-
mired the all male,campus with its
conservative yet open-minded at-
titude, and attitude that preferred to
follow the established campus chan-
nels when advocating change and
discussing public policy. Back then
governing campus bodies were not
viewed with contempt, as they so
often are today, because the students
had a decisive control over the out-
come of events; that is, the success
or failure of organizations such as the
Executive Committee and the Honor
Code, the Inter-Fraternity Council,
the Student Activities Board, the
Ring-tum Phi, the Student Conduct
Committee, and the Student Affairs
Committee, as well as numerous
other influential bodies, depended
solely upon the student body. The
members of these organizations let it
be known that they were selected to
convey and enact the opinions and at-
titudes of the student body at large.

Yet as a senior I feel that the
autonomy of past student bodies has
fallen by the wayside as the Universi-
ty administration has unrightfully
forced its will upon us. The ad-
ministration has moved into student

 

By Scott Dittman
University Registrar

 

1 thought about expounding on
matters registrarial but they
reveal little about me as an in-
dividual and are rarely controver-
sial or even mildly interesting.
Rather, I prefer to expose
something of myself in order to
open a channel of communication
between ‘‘Us"’ and ‘‘Them”’.

Identity is a concept we have
been seeking to define since Adam
and Eve rebelled against God.
(Don’t expect the ultimate defini-
tion here.) In mathematics, it is
the number which when
multiplied by another takes on the
other’s value (i.e. the number 1).
In human affairs, personality is
often defined by listing the in-
dividual's characteristics or
associations. To some I am
already ‘‘Scott’’; still ‘‘Mr. Ditt-
man” to many ("'Dad”’ to a select
few). I've been labelled ‘‘a unique
individual’ and the registrar who
“wants us to be like everyone
else.’ In the commencement line
last June a soon-to-be-graduate
attempted to box me in as either a
liberal or conservative though
neither of his definitions nailed

 

organizations and dictated the way
things were to be run _ while
simultaneoulsy convincing newly
elected student leaders that they
could best do their jobs by ‘‘not rock-
ing the boat.” Soon the student body
is electing leaders into the system
that accept things as they are, as if
the overlording administration in
student affairs is not an unwclcome
interference but somehow a guiding
tradition. As a result, I think that we,
the student body, have unknowingly
supported leaders who are out for
personal goals rather than student
service. Maybe it’s a bit cynical, but
I think you can see it everywhere
from the EC and the IFC to the SAB
and the Mock Convention: students
who look for resume fillers and upon
obtaining positions become mouth-
pieces for the administration as they
coast into grad school.

It’s said all over the campus that
W&L is ushering in a new age of in-
tellectualism with the addition of
women, and students with higher
SAT scores and better gpa’s, but
from a social view, I say that W&L, is
slipping quite complacently into a
new age of passivity. More and more
students feel that nothing can be done
about administratin policy, and at
best they express a hopeless attitude
that everything is going to hell. Let’s
take a look at some of W&L’s pro-
blems as a sign of the times of this
passivity.

One problem that many students
have with the administration is the
increasing IFC laws that limit frater-
nity activities. Now, I agree that with

the new drinking laws, fraternities
must accept the ensuing responsibili-
ty and liability facing them, but I find
the IFC rush rules to be idiotic and
seemingly destructive to the fraterni-
ty system as a whole. Ok, the IFC is
in some deep bullshit, but why do
students jump all over Buddy
Adkins? I think we should take an ex-
istential approach to our problems:
let’s hold ourselves and our student
leaders responsible. I don’t want to
sound like some sixties radical, but if
the fraternities are unsatisfied with
the IFC why don’t we practice a little
civil disobedience by nobody showing
up to the next meeting ... if only this
campus had a few balls.

Another concept which I feel has
slipped away from the student’s
grasp is Honor. Last spring term the
student body sat and watched while a
W&L professor singlehandedly dic-
tated to them what “honor”’ in his
class was. Essentially the student
body was being told that someone
other than themselves should be ap-
pealed to when defining honor, and
when the verdict came, it was ap-
parent that we, the jury, had taken
this hogwash hook, line, and sinker.
Again, those who disagree with the
decision were more than willing to
blame someone other than
themselves. In the failure to believe
that we have the right to police
ourselves, the student’s control fell
another notch.

My last example of the growing
student conformity and passivity
ironically has to do with the Ring-
tum Phi itself. One would hope that

 

FROM THE HILL

me. Whenever someone attempts
to define or categorize you or me
as individuals, they will fail to
capture our essence or vitality.
Point of view seems to have a lot
to do with it. “You’’ are a
homogeneous, spoiled, narrow
group of children. ‘I’? am
somewhere between an_insen-
sitive, midwestern bureaucrat
and the image of God. I don’t
believe W&L intentionally admits,
produces or hires homogenized in-
dividuals though many seek to
take their identity from others or
from their work and thus appear
to have the same consistency.
Some seek to manipulate others in
order to achieve a sense of identi-
ty. (Though recognizable in any
gathering, especially on campus,
the most glaring example of this is
my recent experience is the
“Christian’’ Identity Movement
which seeks to establish for its
adherents and society as a whole
the ‘proper’ identity and rela-
tionship of all races to the
‘“‘superior’’ Aryans.) We judge
each other by the most superficial
traits rather than allowing our ac-
complishments and failures to
reveal each others’ true natures.
Ten years ago W&L’s own Tom
Wolfe was given credit for labell-

ing the ‘‘Me”’ generation of which
you and I are supposedly a part.
Late night cable is full of self-
improvement seminars and
magazines provide myriad self-
awareness tests, all in the name of
personal development and
satisfaction. Yet I watch the
freshman struggling to discover
her identity apart from family
and hometown. I see the senior
struggling to discover who he is
“supposed” to be as a college
graduate or budding corporate ex-
ecutive. Students in between seek
to “find myself’ and new faculty
and staff are forced to elbow their
way into established Lexington or
W&L niches.

When you tell the folks ‘I don't
know who I am’’ you mean you
are not satisfied with what you
already know yourself to be.
(Margaret Halsey) ‘I'm having
an identity crisis’’ means I'm too
wrapped up in myself to think
about you. Rather than succumb-
ing to the lies of narcissism and
hedonism (Buber’s I-I or I-It), we
must recognize that we do not ex-
ist, in fact cannot survive, alone.
We exist in relationships on
physical, social, intellectual and

this paper would have the guts to
print the truth about campus affairs
as well as serve as a public forum no
matter how sensitive the issue. But
alas the Phi, like other organizations,
has succumbed to pressure from
above. In the Honor Code white book
under “Section O,”' it is stated that
the EC has the right to revoke the
Phi’s allocated funds if it should print
anything about an open or close trial.
The reasoning-behind this is that the
paper is read by those other than of
the W&L community, and because of
this fact, honor trial news should not
be printed. How crass and self-
severing this is for the EC to man-
date! If we are to assume that non-
W&L people should be ignerant of our
Honor Code, the logically follows that
we, the students, should be accoun-
table for honesty only when we are
within the idyllic bounds of W&L.
Furthermore, the EC has, in the past,
let comments on trial proceedings go
when they agreed with the paper’s
viewpoint.

All of this is to say that ‘Section
O”’, which seems to be an idea trickl-
ed down from the administration,
has, like other organizational rules,
hindered the student body’s freedom
of speech and added to the feeling
that W&L is controlled by someone
other than ourselves. My suggestion
is that the students take on the at-
titude that we are ir the driver’s seat,
that we are the ones who make and
change University policy. If this can
be done, the above problems will take
care of themselves. If not, this really
will be the W&L country club.

What makes a person individual?

circuits the ever-narrowing spiral
of ‘‘me-ism”’ and expands our op-
portunities for growth and
development. Kind of “If you
would find your identity, you must
lose your identity.’’ Community
activism, classroom  confronta-
tion, and idle discussion over a
beer at the Palms are equally
valuable in discovering identity
when motivated by the thirst to
know the Other. The never-
ending, always-changing process
of “identity’’ frying is filtered
through and confirmed by our ex-
perience on all levels. For me this
has been especially true of the
spiritual.

Whether identity comes Pro-
videntially, through hard work
and many errors, or a combina-
tion of both, it is not something to
be found. Identity —character,
personality, vitality, essence — is
developed by making choices and
accepting responsibility

Well, now you can add “‘opinion-

an identity. I need not search any
longer. Rather, my time will best
be spent in getting to know more
deeply both my Creator and you

Would you rather work ten hours a
week, on campus, at $100 a month, or
work as much as 20 hours a week, off
campus, and make $100 a week in-
cluding tips?

This is a question that those
students who are eligible for the
work-study program ask themselves.

There are 150 W&L students who
participate in the program, which
pays $3.35 an hour. Freshmen can
earn $600 a term, and upperclassmen
can earn $1,100

Some argue that this is not enough,
and Financial Aid Director John H.
DeCourcy recognizes the problem.

“{It] sounds fairly simple, but it’s
extremely complicated to execute ...
For one thing, we don’t have an open-
ended award on work-study ... Earn-
ing the money fits into a financial aid
package. If [students] excede the

up other aid that they could get.

‘Another thing I’m concerned
about is treading on the heels of the
regular part-time employees of the
university ... You have to be careful
of creating a situation where you
have a work-study making more than
a part-time secretary. I’m not saying

Some students do choose to work in

“They work off campus to make

Cognitive Studies Program creates new courses

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

What do Computer Science,
Psychology, and Philosophy have in
common?

The Cognitive Studies Program.

At first glance, it seems strange
that these three majors would inter-
relate. However, according to Pro-
fessor of Psychology David Elmes,
the Cognitive Studies Program is
simply ‘‘a confederation of [these]
disciplines that all happen to be in-
terested in cognition or intelligence.”

Elmes and Ramsey Martin, pro-
fessor of Philosophy, are co-directors
for the new program.

The program first developed a few
years ago when a group of faculty
members realized that they were all
interested in one thing—how the
human mind works. Dean John Elrod
then encouraged the faculty to ac-
quire a grant so that the program
could be started.

The staff members received a five
year grant that was funded by The
Mellon Foundation.

This grant enabled four professors
to attend a four-week seminar on

you on behalf of the United Way and its annual
solicitation of support for the many and varied
agencies that comprise this community effort.

As citizens of Lexington and Rockbridge Coun-
ty, we enjoy the rare privilege of living in a truly
pleasant place. Through the efforts of our City
Council and Board of Supervisors, our tax
dollars are stretched as far as possible to bring
us the range of services that most citizens expect
of their local governments. Even so, we must de-
pend upon our own initiatives and our own
resources to make certain that all of our fellow
citizens have the opportunity to enjoy a quality of
life that many of us take for granted.

This means help in a variety of forms for those
who need it. It also means support for many of
our organizations that enrich the community ex-
perience for us all. In both instances, support of
the United Way is a proven method for extending
our generosity in both of these important direc-
tions.

Each year, members of our University family
assume roles of leadership in the United Way
campaign, giving unselfishly of their time and
energy. Our campus support this year is under
the direction of Jerry Darrell and Larry Pep-
pers, and I know that we shall all want to en-
courage them with the same _ enthusiastic
response we made to David Parker’s splendid
leadership in 1986.

The University’s share of the United Way 1987
goal is $25,000, a modest increase over last year
but a critically important one within the overall

($116,000) campaign objective. We did more than
was asked in 1986, and as we respond in
characteristic manner this year, we shall again
assure the success of the United Way. Your
generous support is earnestly solicited. ~

Security explains fines

Dear Editor,
In last week’s Phi article on parking, no mention
was made of a rather substantial change regar-
ding enforcement of University Motor Vehicle
Regulations and penalties, and we were unable
to point out this change to the 1,150 students who
registered cars during matriculation. Article C,
section 6 now reads: ‘‘Parking fines are con-
sidered official financial obligations due the
University. Unless paid directly by the student
involved, they will be billed monthly, at twice the
normal amount, to parents or others responsible
for payment of the student’s University tuition
charges.” Appeals for tickets must be made
within ten days to us or the Dean of Students of-
fice, and after that they will be turned over to the
Business Office.

ter of parking that you, the student body, faculty,

VRB sets elections

 

By John Starks
Staff Reporter

 

The Voting Regulations Board is
readying itself for freshman elec-
tions for EC representatives and
class officers.

Elections are scheduled for Mon-
day, Oct. 19.

But VRB chairman, Bill Londry,
wants to do more than just announce
and run the election.

He wants freshmen to meet their
candidates before the election.

Such a meeting would help
alleviate the problem that, ‘‘so many
freshmen don’t know other people,”’
said Londry.

Candidates will give short
speeches to introduce themselves
and what they hope to accomplish in
their desired offices.

EC members raised a few ques-
tions about this assembly. Vice
President Pat Schaffer emphasized
the necessity of time limits on
speeches but said he hoped this kind

of meeting would help detract from
the personality contests past
freshman elections have [become ].”’

Junior representative, Chris
deMovellan, mentioned the
likelihood of sparse freshman atten-
dance. Londry, however, said he does
not think it should be ‘‘too much trou-
ble for freshmen to meet for about
forty-five minutes.”’

deMovellen then suggested that the
assembly be advertised as an official
class meeting for freshmen.

Third year law representative,
Powell Starks, said candidates and
voters alike must be informed of the
responsibilities that each officer
holds.

President Brad Root added that the
VRB must publicize the election to
get freshmen interested in running
for office.

Petitions requiring fifty signatures
for each candidate will be available
Monday, October 5 in the University
Center. Petitions are due by Oct. 12.

Candidates will meet with the VRB
and EC before the regular EC
meeting Monday, Oct. 12.

On the night of Thursday,
September 24, about two dozen
students, faculty, and Lexington

residents gathered at the Henry
Street Playhouse for the first of two
nights of tryouts for Anton Chekov’s
play The Three Sisters.

“We had a nice turnout.”’ said Dr.
Al Gordon, chairman of the Fine Arts
Department and director of the play.
“Forty showed for a cast of twelve.”’

The tryouts drew those not only in-
terested in drama, but also those
wishing to meet new people in a com-
fortable atmosphere.

Schuyler Rideout, a freshman from
Charlotte N.C., worked on stage
direction at Salem Academy and she

said, “I love it. I’ts a good way to
meet people, though I’m just a little
bit nervous.”’

Bill Holt, also a freshman said, “‘I
haven't acted in four years but I’ve
been in three major productions. I’m
taking fourteen credit hours and a
PE. this term, but I have a lot of free
time.”’

Bayard Lyons, a junior, said acting
at school provides a ‘‘diversion from
the regular class schedule and is a
good way to meet people.’

Rehersal begins September 27 and
runs until opening night on October
31, the Staurday of Prents Weekend.
The play will open on Saturday so as
not to coincide witb the Glee Club’s
presentation to the student's parents

on Friday night.

“We try to provide a theatre ex-
perience for the parents, to see what
the students are doing,”’ said Gordon.

Students describe Lexington’s summer character

 

By David McDowell
Staff Reporter

 

There can be little doubt but that
Lexington is a college town. A quick
consideration of the number of
barber shops or the fast food
establishments per capita is proof
positive.

Few, if any, of us need any such
date—simply going through the mo-
tions here in Lexington provides pro-
of enough that W&L and VMI are an
integral part of it.

What becomes of Lexington in the
summer then? Probably every W&L
student has imagined what Lex-
ington must be like after virtually all
of the students have left.

Alternately you might picture the
town weathering out its economic dry

season—the city’s coffers awaiting
relief in September with the next
harvest of parking tickets and drunk
and disorderly fines—or maybe the
town rejoieces, breathes a sigh of
relief with its much needed
vacation—no more students parking
their cars from dawn till dusk in the
two-hour zones, and at least con-
siderably fewer drunk and disorderly
persons staggering toward Lloyd's
for the obligatory, much touted 2:00
a.m. six-alarm chili dog

Each summer certain W&L
students stay on in Lexington for
various reasons. Some stay purely
out of convenience; they're paying
rent anyway, and there is usually
work through the university (i.e.,
summer scholars, departmental
research, etc.) as well as the town
itself.

Dance theatre opens

From Staff Reports

 

The North Carolina Dance Theater
will open the season for the
Rockbridge Concert-Theatre Series
on Sunday, October 4 at 2:30 p.m. at
Lexington High School. W&L stud-
ents may attend all R.C.T.S. perfor-
mances for no charge due to the
substantial support given by the
University.

“Regional ballet companies are
rarely top-notch in all respects. But
when they are good, they can be very
good—and this is what the North
Carolina Dance Theater proved
splendidly..." praised the NEW
YORK TIMES.

Acclaimed for its skill at perform-
ing classical, contemporary and
modern works, the NCDT presents
eclectic programs including some of
the most exciting, challenging and
entertaining choreography of our
time. It encompasses a wide variety
of styles and moods, ranging from
such classics as Bournonville’s
Napoli (Act II1), Balanchine’s Allegro
Brillante and Scotch Symphony to
more conte orary works such as Sen-
tra Driver's Resettings, Lar Lubovit-
ch’s Les Noces and Elisa Monte’s
White Dragon. A _ half-dozen new
works are added each season, many
created especially for NCDT by

choreographers from all over the
world.

NCDT was founded in 1970 by
Robert Lindgren and has consistent-
ly attracted a diverse and widely
talented assemblage of professional
dancers. Of the 18 artists currently
dancing with the company, about
half of them have received their pro-
fessional training at the interna-
tionally acclaimed North Carolina
School of the Arts in Winston-Salem,
when the company is based. Others
come to Dance Theater from com-
panies in New York, Texas, Penn-
sylvania and various other locations.
The dancers combine a rich variety
of talents and backgrounds, giving
NCDT the versatility to perform a

wide range of material.
Performing 20-25 weeks each
season, the NCTD appears

throughout the United States and in
Europe. In the past, it has had an ex-
tensive touring record in North
Amerrcan with outstanding reviews.
NCDT has performed in small towns
and large cities, and at such major
festivals as the American Dance

Festival in Durham, N.C., the
Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in
Charleston, S.C., the Festival de
Musica in Estoril, Portugal, La

Danse a Aix in Aix-en-Provense,
France and the Festival of the Two

Certainly these students get to see
Lexington a little more clearly than
most of us. Lexington becomes a
town in her own right to them, not
just a by-product of W&L and VMI.

So radical a thought might at first
seem too much for the average W&L
student, but those summer hangers-
on interviewed found the experience
enjoyable, if wholly different.

“T guess the biggest difference is
that there's always something fun go-
ing on during school,’’ explains Kelly
Shifflett, a sophomore who stayed on
doing psychology research. ‘‘Sum-
mertime is what you make it. There’s
nothing already going on all the
time.”

“It’s a very different town,”’
agrees Margaret Pimblett, a junior,
who in addition to assisting the sum-
mar scholars program, gave tours at

series

Worlds in Spoleto, Italy, where they
received four standing ovations.

This performance in Lexington is
made possible, in part, by a grant
from the Virginia Commission for the
Arts, which received substantial fun-
ding from the National Endowment
for the Arts, a federal agency. Con-
tributions from local businesses and
individuals are also a major souce of
funding in order to keep tickets
reasonably priced.

There is no charge for W&L
students. Additional tickets for this
performance are $10 for adults and $4
for students or a subscription to the
entire series of events is $30 for
adults and $8 for students. The entire
series includes performances by the
North Carolina Dance Theater, the
Amherst Saxophone Quartet, the
musical 4 Child’s Christmas in Wales,
the Boys Choir of Harlem, and the
Ellis Marsalis Jazz Quartet. For
tickets or more information call
Yvonne Emerson at 463-4219 or Lee
RiCharde at 463-9670.

While in our community, the North
Carolina Dance Theater will teach a
master class for intermediate
students following the performance
on Sunday, October 4 from 5:00 to
6:30 p.m. at Southern Seminary
Junior College in Buena Vista. The
fee is $10. Reservations must be
made in advance by calling 463-9670.

the Stonewall Jackson House. She
cites the dearth of blaring stereos
and honking horns and the surplus of
parking places as some of the more
obvious differences

“It’s a whole lot more laid back. It
makes you realize how much your ac

tivities depend on students,’’ says
junior Sean Bugg
For the most part though the

students inverviewed claim that Lex-
ington does not shut down as much as
most students would think. ‘Most of
the [local] things keep  going,”’
asserts Pimblett. Although the
Palms does take a one-week vacation
during the summer season, both it
and Spanky’s continue as social focal
points for Lexington. Their business
is simply drawn from a generally
tamer crowd of locals who descend
on the bars after the student-zealots

leave

Oddly enough, VMI takes on a
somewhat social role during the sum-
mer months. VMI's two summer ses-
sions are not run with the same
gulag-like restrictions of her regular
terms

“I got to meet people at VMI,
which normally doesn’t happen
because of the differences between
the schools ... it was a good ex-
perience to see them [the VMI
students] as ‘normal’ college
students,’’ remarked Shifflett.

Apart from whiling away their
time at Goshen, students found enter-
tainment in the form of live perfor-
mances at the Lime Kiln Theatre and
The Henry Street Playhouse or by
trying to familiarize themselves as
closely as possible with Lexington.

Pimblett took the latter diversion

to its most literal application. ‘‘I got
a map of Lexington and decided to *
cover every Street in the town before ,

the summer Was over,”’ she explains.

Most of the Summer minks agree :

that the first few days after the bulk

of the students had left were a little

disconcerting.
“T had about two days ...

when I

wondered what the hell I'd gotten '
myself into. | was alone in this big |

house—I would just leave the T.V. on
for noise,”’ Shiflett recalled.

“T thought I'd made a_ serious
mistake,”

admitted Bugg. Said he, ’

“For about three weeks I was bored ,

out of my mind.”’ He cited big phone

bills as an unpleasant side effect of '

the difficult transition period.

W&L professors translate 15th-century Buddhist manuscript

 

By Christie Champlin
Staff Reporter

 

Even from a short conversation
with Ann and Minor Rogers, the im-
mense interest they share in
Japanese Buddhism is obvious. This
interest and a lot of dedication led
them to the task of translating a
manuscript from the 15th century.
The text, which is titled Ren-
nyoshoninofumi, was written by Ren-
nyo. Rennyo was responsible for the
establishment of Pure Land Bud-
dhism, the largest and most powerful
Buddhist movement in Japanese
history. The basic concept of Pure
Land Buddhism is that humans are
passion-filled people and, therefore,
cannot do anything to fulfill their
salvation. It is necessary to trust in
Amid Buddha, the Buddha of com-
passion and wisdom who has vowed
to save sentient beings, according to
Minor Rogers, the head of the
religion department at Washington
& Lee and the Jessie Ball duPont
Professor of Religion. This sect of
Buddhism differs from Zen Bud-
dhism in that Zen places a large em-
phasis on seated meditation.

Pure Land Buddhism began in In-
dia, was elaborated in China, and
was refined in Japan. Shinran was
the founder of the movement in
Japan. Rennyo, the author of the
translated text, institutionalized
Shinran’s religious teachings. This
caused the growth in the popularity
of the sect. Rennyo is ‘‘best known
for the letters he wrote to explain the
teachings and express the process of
salvation,’ explains Rogers. He
wrote in the language of the people in
order to make the teachings simple.

After Rennyo’s death, approx-
imately 250 letters were collected.
This group of letters became known
as the Gojo Ofumi. They have
become part of the Buddhist scrip-
ture and are used by priests during
services. The present scripture con-
tains around 2,500 texts. Four or five
years ago Minor Rogers was invited
to translate a text by the foundation
that chose 139 of the 2,500 texts to be
published.

Washington Semester offers

By Francis Coryell
Staff Reporter

 

Last year, William F. Connelly,
Assistant Professor of Politics, took
eight W&L students to Capitol Hill for
the Washington Semester.

This internship, said Connelly, is
worth six credits and tried to give
students an inside look at the political
activities of our government. It
enables the students to combine the
theory they learn in the classroom
and practice it in the real world, Con-
nelly said.

Minor Rogers began to study
Japanese Buddhist tradition when he
and his wife were Christian mis-
sionaries in Japan. They spent two
years in Kyoto for language training
and two years in Kyushu, the
southernmost island of Japan. ‘‘I felt
that I needed to understand more
about the traditions and scriptures,”
said Rogers. Rogers spent six years
at Harvard graduate school studying
comparative religion and wrote his
dissertation about Rennyo. While her
husband was studying religion, Ann
Rogers, who is a_ professor of
Japanese at W&L, was studying
classic Japanese. For his disserta-
tion Rogers needed to translate Ren-
nyo’s letters ‘ ‘in order to understand
what he meant.”

The translation of the texts of the
Buddhist scripture is very important
since the true meaning of the
teaching is a ‘sensitive issue
because Shin Buddhists today debate
and argue about what the text said,”’
commented Rogers. Ordinary people
have heard the letters since their
childhood. This ‘‘shapes the religious
consciousness of Shin Buddhists,”
added Rogers.

The translations will be used as
material for courses in Buddhism.
They will be used in libraries all over
the world. ‘‘The material is not the
kind of material that people will buy
in paperback at bookstores,”’ said
Rogers. He can, however, envision
‘fa small copy of the letters with an
introduction and an annotation which
would be more easily accessible.”’
Rogers describes what he has been
doing ‘‘as a drop in the bucket” com-
pared to the amount of information in
the scriptures. ‘‘There is nothing to
definitely say that the canon is clos-
ed,”’ he is quick to add.

During a sabbatical from 1979-1980
Minor Rogers studied at the Shin
Buddhist University in Kyoto. That is
where the project of translating the
texts got started. Ann Rogers had a
chance to work with the collections of
texts while attending the University
of Virginia to obtain her Masters
Degree. This gave her the training
she needed to work with her husband
on the translations.

Any major could go with tne untiy
requirements being that the student
had to be above the freshman year
and must have completed one of the
following Politics courses: 101, 102
111, or 303.

Connelly started the Washington
Semester program himself when he
arrived at W&L

He worked on Capitol Hill as a
legislative assistant for Con-
gressman Dick Cheney and Senator
Richard Lugar Connelly was work-
ing in a program sponsored by the
American Political Science Associa-
tion

Connelly said he

tried to ‘Place

Minor Rogers made the first rough
translation. After that Ann used her
knowledge of classic Japanese to
make a thorough translation. He did
more with “continually checking for
historical accuracy’’ while she
translated. She encountered a few
problems with translation. One in
particular occurred when she was
describing a concept which is
translated in Japanese as ‘‘mind-
faith’. There is no one English term
which will encompass this broad con-
cept effectively. The word ‘‘faith”
was chosen as the best translation,

even though some Shin Buddhists
argue that “‘faith’’ implies a separa-
tion between God and man. In the
Buddhist religion there is no separa-
tion between the two.

‘*The heart of the text is something
anyone can understand. It is the idea
of trusting. The theological concepts
are certainly fairly complex. They
came out of centuries of Indian and
Chinese thought,”’ said Ann Rogers.
However, she does admit that ‘‘the
text is open to a certain amount of in-
terpretation.”

This is the firstthing that they have
worked on jointly for publication. ‘‘I
worked with him all along, but not
quite like this before,’’ says Rogers,
“it's possible that we will do
something else together.”’

“Tt’s been quite an adventure doing
it. ’ts an amazing experience trying
to understand what a person in the
fifteenth century was thinking and
going through,’’ she adds.

Minor Rogers is also working on
another book about Rennyo which
will include some of the translation in

its introddction. In his book,
however, he will be able to add notes
to help explain the text. The transla-

tion which they just finished will be
“published sort of the way the Bible
is published—just the text with a five
page introduction,” he said. “In a
way I have been working on a book on
Rennyo for a long time, but I thought

that I couldn’t write until I
thoroughly understood what he had
said,’ said Rogers adding that his
wife’s translation has helped that a
great deal.

Washington and Lee welcomes a
new Dean of Freshman this year as
Ken Ruscio, a W&L_ alumnus,
assumes his position in the Student
Affairs office.

A member of the class of 1976 and a
former admissions officer, the new
dean is no stranger to the myriad of
pressures and dilemmas that all
freshman inevitably face. Working
closely with the dorm counselors,
Ruscio hopes to convey to the
freshmen not only the policies, but
the traditions and attitudes of W&L.

While a student at W&L Ruscio was
a dorm counselor and also a member
of the prestigious national leadership
society, Omicron Delta Kappa. After
graduating in 1976, Ruscio spent two
years working in the University’s Ad-
missions office and has now returned
to Washington and Lee to assume his
position as Dean of Freshman.

Dean Ruscio has several ambitious
goals for the 1987-88 school year. The
development of the Gaines residence
hall as an upperclass dormitory and
campus focal point is high on
Ruscio’s list of priorities. Moreover,
the new Dean hopes to inspire a
stronger feeling of class unity among
the freshman.

Fragmentation of the freshman
class occurs very early,’ stated

roommates. The university may be
able to help students with financial
aid

Jenny Bray and Danatha Hoffman
were two of the students who went
last spring. The benefits at Connel-
ly’s past experience were evident
here. Bray worked for Dick Cheney
while Hoffman worked for Richard
Lugar. Bray said her office was in-
volved with the Iran-Contra hearings
and she was kept busy. She said ‘‘I
learned alot. It was my most deman-
ding term, with forty hour work
weeks plus three hour classes.’’ With
all the work, she was still very en-
thusiastic about the program. Bray
said she was most impressed with

Ruscio. ‘‘Right from the beginning
the class is divided not only by frater-
nities, but by other various social
groups as well.’’

Ruscio hopes that through more
class-oriented activities, such as the
“Dorm Football League,’ this
fragmentation of the class can be
avoided and the freshmen will feel a
stronger sense of class unity.

While a student at W&L, Ruscio
was an advocate of coeducation.

“Any great institution, like
Washington and Lee, is always trying
to be better. The core things that are
truly important aspects of Wash-
ington and Lee, the honor system, the
close relationship between students
and the faculty, the friendliness
around campus, these things have
not changed.”’

Ruscio went on to say, ‘‘This was a
great place when I left, today it is
even better.”

Ruscio will continue to teach
political science at W&L.

Ruscio wished to express one final
point to the class of 1991.

“There are plenty of opportunities
outside of the classroom, take advan-
tage of them. However, on the in-
dividual level, one must be sure not
to spread oneself too thin. Be selec-
tive, make decisions and focus your
efforts.’ By doing this, said Ruscio,
one will make the most of the multi-
tude of activities and opportunities
bye await them at Washington and

“The way that my office did the
amount and scope [of work] that it
did.’’ Hoffman said her office was
more involved with foreign affairs.
She said she enjoyed the ‘Total
change in pace, out in the real world
working.”’ According to Hoffman,
another advantage of this program is
the opportunity to make contacts.
Said Hoffman “Everybody I met
knew somebody, and so it would be a
lot easier to get started.’’ Then she
gave one of Connelly’s quotes,
“Knowledge is power in that city.”

Hoffman was also happy with the
program. She said she ‘‘really en
_Jjoyed it, would do it all over again.’

The best way to avoid an encounter
with this prowler is to keep doors and

W&L is hosting its annual blood
drive on October 7th in Doremus
Gym.

Between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m.
students and members of the Lex-
ington community are invited to give
blood. ‘“‘It should be easier for
students to fit blood donating into
their schedules in the afternoon.”
says Libby Atthowe of the Women’s
Auxiliary.

Free sandwiches and sodas will be
provided by the Newcomer’s Club
and the Women’s Auxilary of the Red
Cross, said Atthowe. A Red Cross
nursing unit and Bloodmobile from
Roanoke will provide the equipment
and service for the blood taking,
whereas the local Women’s Red
Cross Auxilary will register and get
brief medical backgrounds from the
donors.

The drive, reached its goal of 150
pints of blood for the first time last

year said event organizer Chris Mar-
tin.

Students will help the Red Cross
volunteers set up equipment annd the
IFC will give $100 to the fraternity
that donates the most blood. Second
and third prizes of $50 and $25 respec-
tively will be rewarded. According to
Martin, the drives goal for this year
is set again at 150 pints.

“We are hoping for an even
stronger drive this year,” Martin
said. ‘‘The blood type 0 Is in high de-
mand in our area so people of this
blood type are strongly urged to par-
ticipate.”’

Professor polaroids pupils

 

By Chris Munsey
Assignment Editor

 

Assistant Professor Richard
Bidlack has brought modern
technology to the old problem of lear-
ning the names of his 74 students.

A Polaroid camera

Minutes into the start of Bidlack’s
Russian history course, he asked
seven students to line up against the
wall of the classroom in Newcomb
Hall.

Bidlack then took a snapshot of the
students with an instant camera, and
had them write down their names on
the print.

“Tf I didn’t take pictures, I pro-
bably wouldn’t learn everybody’s
names,”’ said Bidlack, who joined the
W&L History Department this fall.

Instead of the 45 students an-
ticipated by the history department,
Bidlack said his Growth of Imperial
Russia course contains 62 students in

 

two sections.

In addition to those students,
Bidlack teaches a 12-student Euro-
pean Civilization course.

“It’s helpful for me in getting to
know the students, since I’m new
here and don’t know any students to
begin with,” Bidlack said.

Student’s reaction to his idea sur-
prised Bidlack.

“They were good sports about it,
but they did seem to be self-
conscious,” he said.

Bidlack joked about the idea of
calling students forward from a roll,
lining them up against a wall and
shooting pictures of them.

‘Maybe for a Russian historian it
just comes naturally,” he said.

John Packett, a senior from Salem,
Va. said he understood why Bidlack
decided to take the pictures.

‘“‘When you start getting 30 people
in a class, I can see how it gets hard
to remember everybody’s name.”

Packett said the class seemed sur-

July 16 with a meeting of all the
coaches and players.

At three o'clock the next afternoon,
the team was going through its first
practice under head coach Rocky

« Carzo in Savona, Italy.

After four practices in Italy and no
full contact until game time, the
American team met the top 75 Italian
players in a game in front of

' 2,500-3,000 Italian football fans.

The Americans won the game 18-7

ing two touchdowns. Bobby Wilson,

also from W&L, missed the first

‘ game due to sickness but started with

his W&L teammates Brown, John

second game by the score of 14-3.

3ritish author speaks on Russian spy ring

 

y Stacy Morrison
aff Reporter

British author Andrew Boyles
ke Monday night in Northen
iditorium about his book “The
yurth Man.”

I'he topic of this book is a Russian

ring, made up of four men, that
yvaded deep the upper ranks of the
itish Empire in the late 20s and

sy far the most important aspect
this book is that it was instrumen-
in revealing Anthony Blount’s
ntity as a spy, a fact which had re-
iined undisclosed until this book
published
3lount was “‘the fourth man’”’ to
ich the title refers. Boyle used the
ic name ‘‘Maurice” when he was
erring to Blount. The other three
mbers of this particular spy ring

oder British law, Boyle could not
tify Blount in the book without
s sued for libel charges. British
s very strict as to what may be
ited
e situation concerning Blount
even more volatile because
int was serving as the Queen’s
advisor, and had been knighted

for his services to the British Em-
pire.

Boyle did most of his investigations
and research for his book in the
United States because of the lack of
freedom of information in England
There is no Freedom of Information
Act in England as there is here, so
Boyle was not allowed to review any
English government records. Boyle
said that the CIA and FBI were the
agencies with which he had worked
on this particular story.

Blount was ‘‘exceptionally brillant
and cunning,’’ Boyle said. Blount was
brought up speaking fluent French,
as well as English, and became ‘‘en-
thralled with French galleries and
art’’ at an early age. This would
prove important to Blount later as he
would eventually become the
Queen’s art advisor and an accepted
member of the British Empire

Lord Victor Rothchild, whom
Boyle termed ‘‘accident-prone,’
made the fatal error of bringing
Blount “right into the heart of the
secret establishment,” the in-
telligence agency known as MI-5
Boyle here commented again on the
intelligence and cleaverness of
Blount, who was already a spy at this
point

This spy ring leaked much top
secret information to the USSR in the

sians got plans for atomie weapons
from Blount.

MacLean and Burgess revealed
United States plans dealing with
South Korea to the Soviets. At the
time of that leak, Burgess was a first
secretary to the British Embassy in
Washington, D.C.

Boyle called Burgess and Blount
“completely devoid of any sense of
propriety,’ pointing out than they
had caused the deaths of many peo
ple in France, Germany and Poland.

Boyle added that they were ‘‘work-
ing together to cause the ruination of
the British Empire.’’ Don MacLean
became very important to the com-
munist cause, and Philby was
decorated by the Soviet government
for his services to their cause

Margaret Thatcher was forced to
make a statement about Blount due
to Boyle’s book. After the book was

named Blount and put everything in-
to the open.

The BBE still holds confidential
records on Burgess which cannot be
opened for 100 years. Boyle cited this
as another example of the lack of
freedom of information in England,
for he is interested to know what
those records hold.

In closing, Boyle expressed ‘‘a
great gratitude to the American
system” for all the work that is
allowed him to accomplish.

Boyle attended Blairs College in
Scotland, and studied philosophy in
Paris. After that he served in
military intelligence in the Far East.

by each of the teachers from the dif-
ferent departments that W&L has of-
fered are on cognitive science,
speech acts, the philosophy of
language, and natural language pro-
cessing.

An honors course for University
scholars is currently being offered as
an introduction to cognitive science.

The program is so new that there
are not many students in the pro-
gram and no definite major has been
established, according to Elmes.

The two ways a student can ap-
praoch the program are to either set

SET MONE

up an independent major, or to major
in one of the departments and then
focus on cognition.

Who should participate in the
Cognitive Studies Program?

Professor Elmes advises that “any
student who is particularly in-
terested in how people think, learn,
and solve problems ... will probably
find the cognitive studies course of
particular value.”

As far as the job market is concern-
ed, schools such as Vassar that have
established Cognition programs have
no trouble finding palces for their
students in either graduate school or
in careers.

Cognitive Studies majors are very
popular within fields that utilize any
of the three individual majors. Jobs
range from running computers to hir-
ing personnel.

better than we thought, (we have) no
complaints.”’

 

The police department of Lex-
ington also enjoyed the shorter Rush.

Although noise reports and alcohol
violations increased slightly, Lex-
ington Police Chief Bruce M. Beard
said, ‘‘All in all, it was a very good
Rush.”’

Rush also produced casualties. As
an example, one W&L student ac-
cidentally slit his wrist during Rush
activities and is not planning on

returning to W&L next week after a
three week absence.

With the 1987 Rush to build on,
ideas for the 1988 Rush are starting to
surface.

The majority of the fraternities
would prefer rush to come later in the
term.

Farley said, “there is a strong
movement within the IFC to delay
Rush until the winter term.”

Whether or not that is the result
will depend upon the actions of the’
IFC. When asked about potential
changes in Rush for next year, Atkins
stated, “It is highly unlikely the cur-
rent system will survive.”’

British and American English. “I
keep on wanting to tell people that
they look smart.”’ She also notices
the geographical effect on distances.
“One hour is considered a long way
in England.”’

Peppiatt says that, ‘‘...the drinking
age thing is strange. I’m not even
sure what the age is in England. At
Oxford anyone can drink in public.
Although, I wouldn’t say that people
here drink any less because of the
age.”

Another social difference, she
says, is that, ‘“‘we have quite a lot of
informal dinner parties in England,

where a small group of people will
get together and drink and talk.”’

Oxford does not have fraternities,
but it'is divided into thirty-five col-
leges, “each with a quite distinct
identity.”’ Students live in their own
college, and each college has its own
tutors. There are a lot of rivalries

and competitions between the col-
leges.

Peppiatt commented that, “The
people here are very friendly, more
so than in England.’’ She also notes
that, ‘‘The Honor System is
something which Oxford doesn’t
have. I couldn’t feel safe about leav-
ing my purse in the library there.”’

“l’m very much enjoying my
classes,’ Peppiatt said. This term
she is taking History of Philosophy,
Kant, Existenstialism, Christian
Ethics, and University Chorus.

able to adjust to the drastic slow
down because of his small town
background; ‘‘...someone from New
York probably couldn’t deal with it,”
he warned. He said that although at
times throughout the summer it was
a little slow, “‘after nine months of
study it was nice to have a break.”’
The students all agreed that one of
the most positive things about the
Lexington summer experience was
that it enabled one to get to know
Lexington better, and that in turn
enabled one to get to know
Washington and Lee better. As Shif-

Usually grades suffer,’
continued.

The money for the program is part
of the financial aid budget. 80 percent
comes from the Federal Govern-
ment, and 25 percent from W&L.

“We’re usually in a position where
we’re more than matching, we’re
putting in more than 20 percent,”’ ex-
plained DeCourcy.

The work-study program is signifi-
cant at W&L in that the students real-
ly make a contribution to the running
of the university.

“TI don’t think the students realize
how important they are in the univer-
sity offices, the library, places like
that ... If you took away one hundred
and fifty students, this place would
slow down to a crawl pretty quickly,”
explained DeCourcy. “By and large,
most of them have done a terrific
job.”’

' The majority of the comments

DeCourcy

made by work-study students were in
praise of the program.

Mike Tucci, a junior, worked his
freshman and sophomore year on the
program. He had no complaints
about receiving minimum wage.

“T think that’s great. I mean, it’s a
private institution. They don’t really
even need to pay minimum wage ...
And also, there’s so little taken out of
you, you’ve almost got straight $3.35
an hour.”

Dave Street, a sophomore, works

as an assistant in the Chemistry Lab.
“T really like work-study. The only
thing that is at all bothersome is the
fact that ... for example, I’ve got nine
hours without a break ... Since [my]
work-study isn’t at night, I don’t get a
break, just do it all in a big hunk of
time. But it’s good because I don’t
have to work at night. And the pro-
fessors are really nice...”’

Breton Chase, a junior, works in
the library and thinks very highly of
the program.

“T really like working there,’’ she
commented. ‘‘The people are really
wonderful and they go out of their

way to make things easier for you if
you have a problem with studying or
a personal problem, ... I guess the on-
ly disadvantage is that the wages are
kind of low but when you’re only ex-
pected to put in 2 hours. He said that
the work-study program pays much
too little.

He is making the amount of money
that he wants to, and he has found lit-
tle trouble keeping his grades up.

“T only work nights now. I have to
worry about it, not them. I just don’t
go out and party like I used to,”’ he
said.

Does he think the time commit-
ment is worth it? ‘‘Oh, yes, I get lots
of money!”’ he insisted.

Students that choose to participate
in the work-study program may
prefer to work shorter hours on cam-
pus, while those who opt to seek
employment in Lexington have found
a_ satisfactory trade-off between
longer hours and higher salary.

There is a choice between working
on or off campus, and so students find
which works best for him or her both
in terms of pay and of time.

whole paragraphs of various texts.”

There were lectures as well, but he
said that they, ‘...are not by and
large that compelling...they are
more cut and dry.” He said that,
“there was a lot of self-discipline in-
volved ... it (the work) is all up to
you.”

He also noted that, ‘‘people are
there just to learn, there is less
careerism than at W&L...Students
will read Sanskirt simply because
they are interested.”’

This genuine interest in learning
carried over into social life as well.
“There was a lot more freedom to be
intellectual,’’ Longshore said.
Students often get together at small
cocktail parties and discuss authors
whom they have studied.

“It was the first place where I was
able to discuss poetry over a beer ...(
it was) a change that I appreciated.”

Longshore commented that, ‘‘Brits
tend to look down on Americans in a
joshing sort of way.’’ He now speaks
with an interesting blend of an
English and a Southern accent. ‘‘My
Southern accent has been con-

taiminated a bit,’’ he admitted.

While at Oxford, his British accent
had become so strong that some
fellow students did not realize that he
was from the United States.

He says that he began to feel more
accepted at that point. “‘It’s like a
nightingale, who learns to sing the
other bird’s song ... It was a defen-
sive reaction to being regarded as an
outcast. After (my accent changed),
I began to fit right in.”’

As far as American literature is
concerned, ‘‘they only admit Hem-
ingway ... Henry James and T-.S.
Eliot they claim for themselves.”
Longshore said that there was one

course offered in American
literature, and that it seemed to be
downplayed.

As far as recreational activity,
Longshore was able to row all three
terms. He also played tennis on grass
courts during the spring.

He noted the violence of the foot-
ball (soccer) fans, explaining that he

would check the newspaper so he
could plan to stay indoors on the
weekends of home games.

Longshore admitted that, ‘British
cuisine is horrible.’’ However, he did
acquire a taste for Guinness Stout,
and he also learned that, ‘‘Americans
can’t make tea.’’ He frequented a

THE OLD®e

 

variety of restaurants, including
Jamaican and Indian eating place.

When asked if he were given the op-
portunity to return to W&L or Oxford,
Longshore would say ‘‘yes”’ to both.

“The two places exert an influence
over you that takes you over and
draws you back ... Oxford is the best
place in the world to study English.
I’ve profited immensely by it and it
makes this year at W&L a much
richer experience.”

flett pointed out, ‘‘I went to places I
had never been, and I did things |
wouldn't get to do during the school

year. During the year it’s all frat par-

ties and the hill.”’

Pimblett pointed out that she met
many locals during her summer here
that she would not otherwise have
met. ‘It's a friendly town,” she add-
ed, ‘‘if you say ‘hi’ to someone, they'll
say ‘hi’ back.”’

She said that her summer here af-
forded her a fresh perspective on
Lexington. ‘I recognize Lexington as
a city independent of these two col-
leges. I know a lot more about Lex-
ington, and |’m more interested in
the history of Lexington.”’

And being a native of Newport

News, she noted that ‘‘spending the
summer in a small town was a
benefit, because I got to know a dif-
ferent environment.”

One thing is certain, summertime
in Lexington is definitely not for so-
meone who is looking for life on the
edge. It’s town—really small when
the students leave. Students fre-
quently describe the Lexington sum-
mer as ‘“‘very quiet” and ‘‘very laid
back.”’

That’s not necessarily so bad,
though, as Pimblett noted, ‘‘There
were not many people around, but I
enjoyed it and had been looking for-
ward to it.”” And all of the students
noted that even if it’s not an action-
packed lifestyle at least you're mov-
ed in before everyone else.

Finklestein, Sampson F.
lead Generals to win

 

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Sophomore quarterback Phil
Sampson completed 13 of 22 passes
for 166 yards, one touchdown, and no
interceptions Saturday to lead the

Washington and Lee football
Generals to their first win of the
season, a 17-10 victory over the Cen-

tre College Colonels

In only his second collegiate start,
Sampson locked up the win when he
ran out of the pocket for 12 yards on
third down and 9 with only 1:21 re-
maining in the game. The first down
allowed the Generals to run out the
clock and even their record at 1-1

“It's nowhere near the coaching,
as much as just [Sampson's] innate
ability,’ said head coach Gary
Fallon, who called the sophomore’s
performance Saturday ‘‘a great ef
fort.”

After a tough game against Emory
& Henry in W&L’s season opener,

The best of the best. That’s a claim
the Washington and Lee water polo
team can make, at least in this state.

The Generals won the Virginia
State Championships last weekend,
raising their season mark to 10-1 and
moving up one notch to number 18 in
the latest NCAA Division I poll. By
defeating archrival Richmond for the
second time in two weeks, the
Generals ended the Spiders three-
year hold on the state title.

W&L opened the tournament witha

forth through much of the first
quarter, until Sampson hit wide
receiver Hugh Finklestein for a 31
yard touchdown pass with 3:24 left in
the opening period. Freshman kicker
Carter Quayle added the extra point
to give the Generals a 7-0 lead

A first-year law student, Finkle-
stein “is a very intense player,’’ ac-
cording to Fallon. “‘He sometimes
presses a little, but he certainly
comes through.” W&L’s leading
receiver in 1985, Finklestein pulled in
seven passes for 115 yards Saturday
to lead both teams. This season,
Finklestein has caught 11 passes for
181 yards and two touchdowns

Centre and W&L exchanged field
goals for the only scoring in the sec-
ond quarter. Colonels’ freshman
Wade Farmer hit from 25 yards out
just two minutes into the period, but
W&L’s Quayle answered back with a
31-yarder to close out the first half
and give the Generals a 10-3 lead.

After a scoreless third quarter, the
Colonels tied the game with 11:24 left
in the fourth quarter on a two-yard
run by their leading ball-carrier,
junior Greg Lawson, who carried the
ball 26 times for 97 yards on the after-
noon.

very convincing 17-7 victory over
Lynchburg. Junior David Dietz
scored four goals, and junior Mat-
thew Brady scored three, as the
Generals ran out to an 11-3 halftime
lead and never looked back.

The second game, against
Hampden-Sydney, gave Generals
fans a look into the future. W&L
started all its freshmen, and they
played the entire game on their way
to an 11-7 win.

The semifinals saw the Generals
going up against Mary Washington
College. Juniors David Reavy and
Moose Herring scored two goals each
during the first period as W&L

 

The Generals returned the ensuing
kickoff to the 35-yard line, and Samp-
son went to work, leading W&L on a
six-play drive that ended when Cof-
fland scored from two yards out.
Quayle’s kick provided the Generals
the seven-point margin of victory in
their first win of the season.

Led by senior runningback
Remon Smith, the Randolph-
Macon Yellow Jackets will be go-

football season this weekend
against Washington and Lee, but

played three tough opponents,”
said Fallon. “I know they are

jumped to a 7-0 lead. Senior Simon
Perez and junior Stuart Sheldon add-
ed two goals apiece, and the Generals
cruised the rest of the way to an easy
15-7 conquest. The win set up a
rematch with the defending cham-
pions and hosts, the Richmond
Spiders.

Dietz scored two goals in just over
a minute as W&L sprinted out to a 2-0
lead. The Spiders came back to tie it
two-all, and, behind senior Bo
Michelson’s three first-period goals,
the Spiders led 5-3 after one period of
play.

Hugh Finklestein skys for a touchdown catch against Centre.

Water polo is ‘best team in Virginia’ after state tournament

junior co-captain Reavy said, ‘““We
were concentrating, but we weren't
playing well. We were making little
mistakes that came back to hurt us.”’

The second period was a low scor-
ing affair. The teams traded goals to
start the period, and the score re-
mained 6-4 Richmond until near the
end of the half. In the last 1:50, the
Generals exploded for three goals to
take a 7-6 lead at halftime.

Richmond came out storming in
the third period, with Michelson scor-
ing two goals in the first 45 seconds to
give Richmond an 8-7 lead. The game
swung back and forth, and the score

was tied at 9-9 near the end of the
period when the Generals ripped the
net twice to take an 11-9 lead into the
final period of play.

But the Spiders weren't dead yet.
Michelson scored the seventh of his
game-high eight goals 14 seconds into
the period to pull U of R to within one,
11-10. However, three goals in two
minutes — two by Reavy — put the
Generals in command 14-10. They
went on to an 18-11 win, led by Dietz’s
team-high seven goals and Reavy’s
four goals in the fourth period.

Discussing the up-and-down nature
of the game, co-captain Dietz said,

 

Matt Horridge/The Ring-tum Phi ”

“That’s a bad pattern we've been
developing recently. We jumped
ahead of Army and then let them
come back to tie it before we went on
to win. The same thing happened
against Bucknell too. We got ahead of
them early and they came back to
beat us.”’

The Generals wil] have to iron out
all of their little mistakes this
weekend when they host the first
round of the Southern League Cham-
pionships. W&L will meet Richmond
at 1:15 Saturday. The Generals
should meet top-seeded Arkansas in
the final.

Soccer bounces back with 2 wins

After losing three straight games
to start off the 1987 regular season,
the Washington and Lee men’s soc-
cer team entered into its Old Domin-

Last Saturday the team traveled to

Women lose one game; tie other »

If any opponent shows condescen-
sion towards the Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team, it can be
assured of a powerful retaliation.
This is a team that has already tied
one rival, and has the added con-
fidence of giving the No. 2 team in the
conference a struggle.

Last Saturday, the Generals
played Sweet Briar and emerged
from their first game with a well-
earned tie. The score was 2-2, with
sophomore Catherine Baillio scoring
both goals for W&L. Through yester-
day, Baillio was the leading scorer in
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference, a fact which in itself adds

Jack Pringle also had an outstanding
game in the goal with nine saves in
the first half alone.

The Generals got their second win
of the season on Tuesday when they
faced Eastern Mennonite College on
Smith Field. Outscoring Mennonite
3-2, W&L’s goals were scored by
Sarber, Coll, and sophomore Rick
Silva.

The fact that W&L’s first two vic-
tories were also their first two ODAC
games does not indicate at all that
another ODAC championship will be

reassured by their last two perfor-
mances, but Brown said, ‘I think
we've played two of the easier teams
in the ODAC, so we’ll just have to

prowess to the team and proves to
others the talent and serious inten-
tions of the Generals.

Co-captain Liz Smith commented
on the collectively determined at-
mosphere, ‘‘The fact that we now
have varsity status gives us a lot of
confidence,’’ Smith said. ‘We're set
to surprise all the teams who con-
sider us underdogs simply because
this is our first competitive year.

“I’m very pleased with the prevail-
ing attitude, and I feel that the com-
bination of our experienced members
and the strength of the freshman
talent has improved our chances
tremendously.”

see,”

Head coach Rolf Piranian agrees
with Brown, ,inethat the ODAC
schedule is a very tough one all the
way through the season.

“T think that most of the games in
our conference will be pretty mich
dog fights,’ said Piranian. He also
said the only team so far this season
that has been playing better than the
rest of the pack is Mary Washington,
which was ranked fairly high na-
tionally at the close of the NCAA
Division III schedule last year.

This is not to indicate that the
Generals will see another ‘‘falling
out’’ this season, but it will be push
and shove all the way. W&L will play
host to Roanoke College on Smith
Field on Tuesday, Oct. 6.

Macon/Ashland on Tusday, the
respectable score of 2-0 was enough
to keep the players’ spirits high,
especially since Sweet Briar was
beaten by RM 8-1. Junior Betsy
Parkins said, ‘‘Realistically, the
score should have been 1-1, but there
were times when we didn’t make full
use of our opportunities.”

Co-captain Laurel Mattson agrees
with the observations made by her
teammates. ‘“‘We definitely have a
good chance of doing well in the con-
ference our team is not at the bottom,
as some other schools may believe,
she said.

Today, the Generals travel to play
Hollins, their biggest rival, and W&L
is positive of gaining its first victory.

Men harriers are shutout in first meet

 

Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Shutouts in football, basebail,
hockey and soccer are usually an
everyday occurence, Shutouts in
cross country, however, are quite
rare, and a shutout is exactly what
happened to the Washington and Lee

» men’s cross country team last Satur-
day at Mary Washington.

The Generals lost 15-50, unable to

« place a single runner in the top seven
places. In cross country, low score
wins, with the team’s first five run-
. hers scoring the same number of

points as the place they finish. A
shutout occurs when a team has its
top five runners as well as its two
displacers finish ahead of the No. 1
runner for the opposition.

“We didn’t run well,’’ said head
coach Dick Miller. ‘We have run bet-
ter. Mary Washington has got a good
team — a well balanced team. They
had their first seven men within 52
seconds of each other. That’s tough to
beat.”’

Senior co-captain Scott Rippeon
was W&L’s top finisher, coming in
eighth place with a time of 27:11 over
the five-mile course. Junior Bill

Sometimes a team’s performance
+ is measured by whether or not they
chalked up the ‘‘W”’ in the win col-
“umn. This was not the case last
» Saturday for the Washington and Lee
women’s cross country team.
The Generals lost 19-36 to host
«Mary Washington, but some sparkl-
ing individual performances were
“turned in by W&L. Freshman Paige

 

Cason, in her first collegiate meet,
shattered the school all-course five-
kilometer record. Cason finished sec-
ond in a time of 20:43, a full two
minutes ahead of the previous mark
of 22:45 set by Stephanie Smith last
season.

But it doesn’t stop there. Junior
Anne Geary (22:14, seventh place),
and freshmen Lovell West (22:15,
8th) and Heather Jenkins (22:27, 9th)
also beat Smith’s record.

“T’m very pleased,’’ said head
coach Jim Phemister. ‘I think they

(ith) and Rick Norris (12th) round-
ed out the front five for the Generals.

Miller said the team was not
prepared for the course. Mary
Washington’s course is extremely
flat, resulting in a fast pace and fast
times.

“We were not ready for a flat
course,’’ he said. “We were not ready
for the pace. We lost contact early in
the meet and you can’t do that.”

Rippeon further explained. ‘‘We’ve
been training on hills with very little
speed work,” he said. ‘{Mary
Washington] also changed their

or about a personal best and all nine
runners [finished] in less time than
we've ever had all our runners in
before.”’

“Everybody was stronger in-
dividually and the whole team was
stronger,”’ he said. ‘““You can’t ask
for a whole lot more.”

Cason had broken the school record
earlier in a time trial. Phemister,
however, said the outstanding perfor-
mances came as somewhat of a sur-
prise.

“I’m not really worried yet. This

dicates.’’ Randolph-Macon was
shut out in its first two games — a
23-0 season-opening loss to
Junaita College and a 33-0 poun-
ding by Washington and Jeffer-
son.

Last week on the road against
Catholic University, the Yellow
Jackets took the lead with 5:04 left
in the game on a 66-yard punt
return by sophomore Rich Con-
klin. But Catholic scored a
touchdown with only 1:10 remain-
ing and pulled off a 19-14 victory.
Because of these three losses,
“they’re going to be a hungry
bunch over there,”’ said Fallon.

But, after last year’s game
against the Yellow Jackets, the
Generals should be just as
hungry. In Lexington, W&L took
the lead, 20-14, on a one-yard
carry by tailback Kevin Weaver
with only 32 seconds left in the
game. But Randolph-Macon pull-
ed off a miracle, as wide receiver
Lance Herring caught a deflected
pass in the end zone with only one
second left. Herring kicked the
conversion attempt himself, giv-
ing the Yellow Jackets a 21-20 vic-
tory.

The W&L defense will probably
be keying on Smith, who had 25
carries for 95 yards in iast year’s
game. ‘‘He’s a really explosive
runningback,”’ said Fallon. A
first-team Old Dominion All-
Conference selection in 1986,
Smith ‘‘can turn a little play up
the middle into a 90-yard run,
becaue he’s got tremendous
breakaway speed and great open-

Following weeks of rumor, the
truth about the 1987 Washington and
Lee Homecoming concert has surfac-
ed - the concert is Fixxed

On Friday night, October 9th, the
Student Activities Board will present
Dream So Real and The Fixx in con-
cert at the Student Activities
Pavillion beginning at 8:00 p.m

Dreams So Real will be opening for
the second straight time at
Washington and Lee. Last May, they
put on a fantastic show opening for
Love Tractor and Guadalcanal Diary
in the spring concert, and this year
will be warming up the stage for The
Fixx

“Students can look forward to a
wider variety of talent and entertain-
ment this year,’ said S.A.B. chair-
man Sean Coyle.” ‘‘We (the S.A.B.)
are going to spend the student’s
money more wisely, and hope to pro-
vide entertainment for the entire stu-
dent body S:

The Fixx comes to W&L having
just released ‘‘React,”’ a collage of
live music, old hits, and three new
studio cuts. Though their last album,
“Walkabout,”’ failed to wow music
audiences like ‘Phantoms’ and
“Reach the Beach,’’ their previous
two albums, The Fixx is optimistic
about their new release.

‘Because our last album was a bit
out of synch with mass appeal, we
were forced into ‘change or bust’”’
said lead singer Cy Curnin. ‘Deep
down we are a rock n’roll band...I
think the new songs are a lot better
-fresher, It was almost like starting
over.”

Many will remember the populari-
ty the Fixx enjoyed in the early 1980's
with the release of ‘Reach the
Beach,” a platinum album whose

smashes ‘‘Saved By Zero’”’ and ‘One
Thing (Leads to Another)’’ became
staples of Night Tracks, Friday
Night Videos, and MTV.

In addition to these Fixx classics,
songs we can expect to hear Friday
night include ‘‘Red Skies,”’ ‘‘Deeper
and Deeper,’’’’Stand or Fall,” ‘‘Built
for the Future,’’ and the smash’*hit
“Are We Ourselves’ from the

“Phantoms” LP.

The new music is stronger. It
pulsates and drives. ‘‘React” is like a
bonding force between the past, pre-
sent, and future of The Fixx’s music.

“In the end,”’ says Curnin, ‘‘all we
can do — all you can do — is jux-
tapose imagination against reality.
Hopefully, your imagination will
become reality. It only takes a small

Psunspot

 

By Greg Unger
Music Critic

 

This is the latest release from
XTC’s alter ego—The Dukes of
Stratosphear—and the album, Psonic
Psunspot, is psensational.

Under this psedonym, XTC fully
immerses themselves in the current
60's revisionist craze without sound-
ing stale or repetitive. This shouldn't
seem difficult, for they're credited
with helping to create the style and
simultaneously thrusting it upon us
as representative of the cutting edge
of progressive music in the late 80's.

However, we like that. This stuff is
great, if a little difficult to nail down
as wholly representative of either

The Dukes or XTC. The songs ob-
viously smack of XTC’s recent
Skylarking L.P., yet they borrow
heavily from the 60’s sound—most
notably the Beatles and the Beach
Boys.

To claim that The Dukes are
Beatles wannabe’s is a little strong,
yet not unimaginable. Perhaps this
album can best be described as
chameleon—like, which only stands
as a testimony to their musical vir-
tuosity. Andy Partridge’s lyrics and
voice remain strong and distinct, and
though reminiscent of another era,
there can be no mistaking this music
as also distinctly modern.

Entertainment Critic

 

After the umpteenth time Michael
J. Fox appeared on the cover of
Rolling Stone, 1 cancelled my
subscription; I had been shelling out
money hopeing for a magazine that
treated the culture surrounding rock
and roll seriously and instead got
Tiger Beat. But right around the end
of summer the teeny mag got my
attention—I was hearing friends
gripe about a feature article in the
August 27th issue of RS. Apparently
Rolling Stone had attempted to
catalogue, ,through the opinions of
seventeen rock writers, the best 100
albums released over the last twenty
years, and apparently none agreed
with their list. Which didn’t surprise
me. Rock music has almost as many
sects as it has groups—an unbroken
spectrum of musical tastes from
Deadheads to Madonna Wanna Be’s
to Bang-Y our-Head-and-be-
Obnoxious heavy metalists—
everybody has their rock and roll
tastes and whoever thinks differently
is obviously a tasteless clod.

Well, I'm no better than the next
person, and when I first saw the arti-
cle I called b.s. on probably half the

the L.P. ‘“‘Have you seen Jackie”’
follows and is the weakest track on
the album. Here The Dukes of
Stratosphear begin to intermingle
the tracks on the album with an
essentially ambigious and weird
fairy-tale that unravels as each song
is played. Never mind. ‘“‘Little
Lighthouse”’ is a great song worthy of
single status. ‘‘You’re a Good Man
Albert Brown’ sounds extremely
beatleish (remember ‘‘Obla-di, obla-
da’’?) and the first side ends with a
R.E.M.-ish tune, ‘‘Collideascope.
The ““B” side opens with Psonic
Psumspots most stunning — son,

albums., but after mulling it over for
a while, I saw that, like it or not, most
of the albums that made the list are
justifiable, whether in terms of in-
fluence or simply out of giving
representation to a_ particular
musical sect. Naturally I had some
irreconcilable differences, but rather
than attempt to discredit that music I
instead offer a handful of alubms
(with capsule explanations) which
were disgracefully omitted from the
top 100.

This is the Moody Blues (The Moody
Blues) This is has a unity to it that
most greatest hits albums _ lack.
Many ot the songs appearing on tne
album were re-recorded and inter-
twined with other songs in fresh set-
tings. Justin Hayward has vocal con-
trol and power virtually unequalled
by any singer in any genre. Nearly
every word he sings is a lung full.
This is exists as a milestone to
Timothy Leary and his disciples who
thought that acid would herald in a
new area of awareness and
understanding. Acid lost its in-
nocence in hard and unromantic
ways, but This is the Moody Blues re-
mains as a historical document to a
time when a few romantic (if naive)
revolutionaries stood, as they pro-
claim, “On the Threshold of a
Dream.”’

Tommy (The Who) Pete Townsh-

LP is Psensational

“You’re My Drug.” This song is ab-
solutely addictive and ranks with the
best ever done by XTC. ‘‘Braniacs
Daughter’ should've been on Sky-
larking. The last 2 songs are slower
and accentuate the charisma in
Patridge’s voice. ‘‘Pale and
Precious” is particularly strong, as
well as heavily influenced by the
Beach Boys. It’s also schizophrenic
slow and then picking up the pace

Psonic Psunspot effectively blends
the old and the new. XTC fans — buy
this album/tape/CD. Everyone
else—same thing.

end’s rock opera elevated the Who to
superstardom. Tommy tells the story
of Tommy Walker, a deaf, dumb and
blind pinball wizard whose sensory
deprivation gives him undistracted
intellect so that when his sefhses are
restored he becomes the ‘new

Messiah.”’ Townshend's story is in-
ventive, his lyrics poignant: “If I told
you what it takes/to reach the
highest high/you’d laugh and say
‘nothing's that simple’/But you've
been told many times
before/Messiahs pointed to the
door/and none had the guts to leave
the temple!’’ Tommy swept rock
away from the standard two and a
half minute single and gave musi-
cians free reign.

album placed a group of young

son. Circle is deserving of placement
both in terms of sheer listenability
and for bridging together two genera-
tions and their particular sounds of

zy's Phil Lynott are just some of the
vocalists contributing to this
dynamic manifestation of a truly
weird idea. I offer this to you because
a) it’s musically flawless b) it’s
universally appealling and c) so-
meones on my hall borrowed it from
me freshman year and I sure would
like it back if you’re reading.

Fragile (Yes) — Unlike many rock
albums with heavy classical in-
fluences, Yes doesn’t oury itself in
ostentation on Fragile. Fragile is ar-
resting, it demands attention. I
always play it in the car when I want
people to shut up. Steve Howe’s
lightening-quick guitar riffs, Rick
Wakeman’s keyboard finesse, and
Jon Anderson’s inimitable vocals
make this a five star album.

I guess the great thing about the
three way marriage of the population
explosion, technology and rock and
roll is that music has really catered
to the individual in the last twenty
years. As Rolling Stone concedes,
“The only master list that matters is
the one you carry around inside your
head.”’ I’ve done a great deal of
listening in my day, though, and after
a while it becomes clear that some
few albums are not merely listened
to passively—they are experienced,
they involve the listener. And they
garner some defensive fans along the
way.

Wé&L Phi Gamma Delta wins

 

By Jessica Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

Federal Express really pays off.

Last year, the Washington and Lee
chapter of the Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity entered the competition
for the Condon Cup, an award given
to the chapter within ‘‘Fiji’’ which
shows the most improvement over
one year.

Thinking the application would
miss the deadline, the chapter sent
the form through Federal Express to
ensure its prompt arrival.

“I spent a lot of time filling out the
application. We thought it would be
late, so we sent it Federal Express,”
said Rob MacPherson, treasurer for
the fraternity.

During July, Fiji sent a represen-
tative to Fiji Academy not knowing
that they would be presented with
“one of the most sought-after
awards,”’ according to Tiger Thiel, a
field secretary for Phi Gamma Delta
international fraternity.

Kevin Nash, a sophomore at W&L
had the honor of receiving the award
that now rests in the Fiji living room.

The award is named for Herbert T.

“—

 

Condon, Sr., who was a member of
the Sigma Tau Chapter of Fiji at the
University of Washington. The Sigma
Tau chapter presented the interna-
tional headquarters with the award
as a representation of Condon’s ser-
vice, said Thiel.

Thiel said W&L’s chapter of Fiji
will keep the cup through August of
1988.

“This is one of the most sought-
after awards, because many
chapters make a great deal of im-
provement and it is very difficult to
judge,”’ Thiel said.

received and number of donors for
the second year ina row.

“Last year, which ended June 30 of
this year, the Annual Fund collected
$1,744,000, which is a substantial in-
crease over our goal of $1,600,000,”
said J. Hardin Marion, chairman of
the Annual Fund.

Marion added that aside from the
number of dollars donated, records
wre also set for ‘‘number of donors,
in terms of the percentage of alumni,
and parents, and in the size of the
average gift.”

The total number of donors in-
creased form 6,621 to 7,019. The
percentage of alumni donors went up
4 percent to 6,422, as did the percen-
tage of parents who contributed, up
45 percent to 525.

Contributions by members of Lee
Associates and Colonnade Club
members went up, as well. Colon-
nade Club members, those who con-
tribute $100 or more to W&L, increas-
ed 11 percent to 3,670.

Total donations by Colonnade Club
members increased 14 percent to
$708,334. Lee Associates, those who
contribute $1,000 or more, increased
19 percent to 529. Their total dona-
tions also increased 19 percent to
$938,705.

A new category of giving is being
started in the Annual Fund this year.

“Starting this year, we will also have
the ‘‘General’s Council” for those
who contribute $10,000 or more to the
university,”’ Marion said.

This years goal, according to
Marion, is $1,850,000. “My job is to
see if we can beat that goal again this
year,”’ Marion said.

Marion explained that the Annual
Fund reaches each alumnus through
a class agent, an alumnus who
volunteers to contact each member
in his class.

There is at least one agent for
every class, and in some cases there
are co-class agents or associate class
agents, Marion said.

“We try to contact every alumnus
through the class agent as personally
as we are able — through a letter or
phone call, or if possible, a face-to-
face visit,” said Marion.

In addition to trying to reach each
alumnus four times a year, Marion
said the Annual Fund uses methods
such as the student phone-a-thon to
bring in donations.

This year the Annual Fund will use
three new approaches in its attempt
to break records again. The first new
program is a series of regional
meetings across the country.

“These meetings are hosted by a
trustee or a member of the board of
directors or someone in the leader-
ship of the Annual Fund,” said
Marion, ‘‘and key contributors are
invited to the meeting in their
locale.”’

Marion added that the content of
the meeting concerns ‘‘what is hap-

pening at the university, what is
needed for the university and urgings
for increases in their levels of con-
tributions.”

Farris Hotchkiss, McMiller and
Marion began their tour of these
regional meetings last week when
they went to Baltimore, Washington
D.C., Philadelphia and.New York.
Next week meetings will be held in
Houston, Dallas, New Orleans, Mem-
phis, Tampa, Atlanta and Roanoke.
The final meeting will be held a week
later in Richmond.

The second new approach is the
formation of a ‘new’ class that is
composed of all participants of the
Washington and Lee Alumni College.

This Alumni College is a summer
program of three-week-long inter-
disciplinary scholastic programs
that gives alumni the chance to
return to W&L and attend classes.
“This brings a lot of alumni back to
campus that might not have been
back otherwise,”’ Marion said.

To take advantage of this situation,
the Annual Fund appointed a class
agent for the alumni of the Alumni
College. ‘‘The very responsible Jim
Ballengee has agreed to serve as the
class agent for this project for this
year,”’ Marion said.

Marion said that he hoped this pro-
gram would reach non-alumni, as
well, and provoke them to donate,
especially in the cases of spouses or
friends of alumni who had _par-
ticipated in the Alumni College.

4 ,|Fire guts apartment,

W&L students displaced

 

By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

Two Washington and Lee Universi-
ty undergraduates and one law stu-
dent were left homeless and one
cat was killed after a fire gutted one
apartment and caused extensive
smoke damage in the other early
Saturday morning.

The apartment building, which was
located at 401 East Nelson St. near
Stonewall Jackson Hospital in Lex-
ington, was partially gutted and suf-
fered from extensive smoke damage.
The apartment containing the two
undergraduates, sophomores Ted
Evans and Mason Van Sciver, was
completely destroyed in the fire,
which was believed to have been
caused by either faulty wiring in the
electrical system or a faulty connec-
tion in the gas stove.

Evans was the first to arrive at the
scene of the fire. He said that when
he arrived home around 2:20 a.m. he
noticed smoke billowing out from the
windows.

“As I was coming up the hill I
noticed the windows were smoking. I
parked the car and kicked in the front
door. I guess the sudden blast of air
caused the flames to grow, because
they knocked me off the front porch.”’

Evans said he then ran across the
street to the hospital, where he called
the Lexington Fire Department.

‘Windows started popping out as I
got back. I saved some things until
the flames got too intense.”

Lexington Fire Chief Brian Causey
said the fire department received a
call from Edward Evans at 2:28 a.m.
Saturday. He said that five units and
21 men were dispatched onto the
scene within three minutes, where
they managed to prevent the fire
from spreading to the neighboring
apartment of Kevin Henderson from
Taylors, S.C., 3rd year law, and his
wife who were out of town when the
fire occurred. The Henderson’s
apartment suffered only smoke
damage although their pet cat died in
the fire.

Evans and Van Sciver were not at
home when the blaze started.

Evans and Van Sciver have moved
to 701 North Main, where they have
been working to replace their
clothes, books and other personal
items which were all destroyed in the
fire. Evans estimated his and Van
Sciver’s losses at around $14,000.
Evans was insured under his
parents’ home owners’ policy.

Evans’s and Van Seiver’s landlord,
Bill Stearns, helped the two in
locating housing by refering them to
Alice Strecker of Mead Associates,
Strecker put the two up in the house
known to many W&L students as
Fishbait.

Evans said he disagreed with the
fire department's explanation of the
cause of the fire.

“I was told that by the burn pat-
terns, the fire started in the far right
hand corner, where we had a lamp. I
think the cord may have just
frayed.”

The Henderson’s could not be
reached for comment. They present-
ly are living in Staunton while they
search for a new place to live.

national fraternity award

United States and Canada competing
for the cup. This (the Condon Cup)
and the Cheney Cup — the most
outstanding chapter — are the most
sought-after,’’ Thiel said.

The application for the cup is judg-
ed by an independent panel of
graduate brothers. The international
headquarters is not involved with the
selection, leaving no biases, said
Thiel, a graduate of Ohio University
and a member of the Alpha Omega
chapter of Phi Gamma Delta.

“T think winning the cup got a lot of
the group motivated. People are real-
ly beginning to do more things for the

house,” said Stanley Hall, president
of the W&L chapter of Phi Gamma
Delta.

Hall said many people were sur-
prised that the chapter won a na-
tional award.

Hall said he plans to keep everyone
motivated and run things like the
past year — when the chapter was
under the direction of Jim Cockey.

A major achievement was the
remodeling of the house, said Major
Randall Hill, advisor for the fraterni-
ty.

“Before, they did not have any-
where to recruit and now they got

everyone together and have improv-
ed their pledge class,’’ Randall said.

“Basically, we’ve got a good group
of people. They are all pretty respon-
sible members of the fraternity and
good students,” Hill said.

This year Fiji received 17 pledges,
but their president did not attribute
their recruiting success to the
recognition they received this sum-
mer.

“We did not emphasize the cup, but
instead focused on the brotherhood,”

_ IFC and fraternities grapple with the issue of pledge hazing

 

By Pete Boatner
News Editor

 

Every year after Rush the issue of ‘“‘haz-

ing,’’ the abuse of pledges at fraternities,
crops up on campus.

This year, though, it has grown into a ma-
jor issue for the IFC.

At least one case of hazing has already
been reported this year, according to Univer-
sity Psychologist James Worth.

“Hazing tears down unity...it victimizes an
individual,” said Worth, who was a fraterni-
ty member in college.

Every year, said Worth, he talks to
freshmen who de-pledge because of what
they see as undue abuse from upper-
classmen.

“Hazing says to the pledge, ‘We the
members of X fraternity don’t really care
how you’re doing, we’d rather have fun at
your expense,’”’ said Worth.

Though he ‘‘doesn’t have the sense that
hazing is on the increase,”’ Worth won’t say

that hazing has dropped off significantly in
recent years.

Reports of physical abuse such as paddling
have declined, he said.

However, ‘‘a lot of people won’t talk about
hazing because they want to remain loyal to
the fraternity,” he said.

That comment highlights one of the pro-
blems in discussing hazing. No one, from the
IFC’s faculty advisor to fraternity pres-
idents, denies that hazing occurs, but all are
reluctant to cite specific examples for fear of
reprisals.

Informally, though, members of several
fraternities confirm that pledge activities in-
volving forced drinking, physical exertion
such as calisthenics, ‘kidnapping,’ and
name-calling do take place.

All of these activities could fit into the IFC
constitution’s definition of prohibited ac-
tivities, which precludes ‘‘any physical or
emotional hazard to the individual. Such
potential hazards include alcohol abuse,
dangerous physical exertion or exhaustion,
physical or emotional violence, paddling and

other types of abuse.”’

According to Associate Dean Leroy C.
“Buddy”’ Atkins, hazing at W&L, though less
serious than in the past, is still a major pro-
blem.

Recent rumors that any house caught

practicing any form of hazing would be ex-
pelled from campus are nof quite accurate,

Atkins said.

Lesser offenses would result in less serious
punishments, he said.

“Forced drinking of any kind is highly
dangerous and would be construed as haz-
ing,”’ he said. ‘‘I hope there’s a greater sense
of awareness this year that...even subtle
pressure to drink is a serious [ offense].”’

IFC President Mark Farley supported this
explanation.

“Serious hazing’ would earn a house the
maximum penalty, Farley said, but he added
the IFC wants to keep its options open.

“The IFC reserves the right to use suspen-
sion or expulsion on a first strike basis,’ he
said, explaining that a single serious offense
could bring harsh reprisals

» . ORE Rae +

As far as what constitutes hazing, Farley
thinks the limits are clear.

“All frats have received from their na-
tionals a list of ‘‘do’s’’ and ‘‘don’t’s,”’ he said.
“There’s not a fraternity member out there
who has a question about what is hazing.”’

“If you’re not sure about an activity, ask

yourself this question: ‘If it beeame known to
the general public, would it be embarrassing
to the chapter or to the university?’ ’’ he
said.

But he added, ‘I would be naive to think
that hazing does not go on,”’ he added

At least two houses on campus claim to
avoid all forms of hazing.

‘‘We were founded at VMI on the principle
of not hazing,” said Sigma Nu President Jon

Solomon, adding that at the time, VMI was
known for intense hazing

He said this policy entails limiting
freshmen, called ‘‘novices’’ rather than
pledges, to activities that ‘build respect for
the brotherhood and for the physical house,”’

This means no freshmen-only clean-ups,
and no use of freshmen for errands, he said

Lambda Chi Alpha gives its freshmen
pledges, called ‘associate members,”’ full
rights as soon as they join, said fraternity
educat6r Matt Upton.

“‘We don’t haze, it’s just not worth the has-
sle,” he said.

Other houses also claim to avoid hazing,
but think they should be allowed to set their
own policies.

Basically we haven’t been doing things we
thought were bad in the past, so we really
didn’t have to change this year,”’ said Reese
Lanier, Phi Delta Theta president

“The question is, what is considered haz-
ing,” he said. ‘‘I feel it’s pretty cut and dry.”’

Lanier also said he thought there was ‘‘a
serious attitude change’ among fraternities
this year

Sigma Alpha Epsilon President Steve
Szezecinski said, ‘‘| Hazing] has gotten a lot
better since we were freshmen... there have
been leaps and bounds here

“T see the administration’s point,’’ he said,

See Hazing, page 9
OPINION
Hazing

Ata recent Interfraternity Council meeting it was said that
any house found guilty of hazing would immediately be
removed from the Washington and Lee campus. However,
not result in severe physical injury? Are they any less a
violation of the law?

It is great to have such a policy for what is deemed
“‘serious”’ hazing incidents; but what about incidents that do
not result in such severe physical injury? Are they any less a
violation of the law?

Fraternity hazing at W&L seems to be a taboo subject. One
rarely sees stories in The Ring-tum Phi about it or frater-
nities punished for it. Even so, if everyone can remember
their freshman year in the dormitory, there are many hazing
examples to be found.

The times that pledges have come home exhuasted and
covered with mud after a ‘‘pledge function.’’ The phone calls
from pledges who have been driven anywhere from 15 to 30
miles out of town and left with only a quarter to get home.
The surprise arrival of brothers in the dorm who kidnap
pledges on weeknights. All these are examples of hazing that
seem to happen regularly at W&L. Although no one has been
seriously injured as a result of these activities, as far as we
know, they should still be termed serious hazing offenses,
worthy of considering the suspension of a fraternity’s
charter.

Not all hazing is physical. Fraternity brothers can place
undue amounts of stress on pledges by harrassing and em-
barrassing them. Verbally berating them for no reason other
than to remind them they are pledges, or requiring them to
wear ridiculous clothing that would bring them to public
shame are prime examples. Emotional scars, while not as
obvious as physical ones, can be just as damaging.

Some say that the whole process of hazing is to make the
pledges stronger and closer to the house. Of course, the
pledge class may be driven closer together in an effort to pro-
tect themselves from being hazed even further. But how can
a fraternity honestly say that they are building brotherhood
by physically and mentally abusing pledges?

The whole process of pledge training is to begin assim-
ilating the new members into the house. It also gives both the
fraternity and the pledges a chance to change their mind,
which is extremely important. However, the pledges should
be taught the principle of brotherhood as it applies to the
ideals of the fraternity. They should not be taught to fear the
brotherhood. Hazing does just that, and makes a mockery of
the entire fraternity system, even the innocent.

Safe sex

As time goes on and the danger of Acquired Immune Defi-
ciency Syndrome (AIDS) grows larger and larger, it must be
assumed that the deadly disease will eventually reach the
Washington and Lee campus. Whether that time arrives this

 

month or next year is unknown. But we know this: °

Washington and Lee needs a policy to help deal with the
situation when it arises.

There are many problems that will have to be dealt with if
a student tests positive for the disease. If the student chooses
on-campus housing, will he or she have roommates? How will
the students react? Will there be a possibility that the univer-,
sity’s action will result in a lawsuit? All of these questions,
and others, are very delicate and must be handled with care.

Of course, part of the policy needs to provide for the educa-
tion of students and faculty about AIDS. Many of the pro-
blems that have been seen in society have resulted from ig-
norance, which results in AIDS victims being treated as
pariahs. If the W&L community are well-informed on the
subject, many future problems may be avoided.

Part of this education should be promoting safe sex among
students. It has been charged that providing condoms either
in the dormitories or elsewhere will cause students to be
more sexually active. This is a ridiculous accusation. If the
sight of condoms for sale or give away induces students to
have sex, they would have begun long ago after seeing them
at the drug store or Stop-In.

The fact of the matter is college students are sexually ac-
tive. Although it is fine to advise abstinence as the best pro-
tection from sexually transmitted diseases, alternatives
should be available for those who choose to remain active.
Moral judgments on sexual behavior should not be part of a
policy; the safety of the student body should be. Therefore,
easily obtainable condoms are just plain common sense.

Any policy the administration may decide upon should
allow for the humane treatment of students with the disease.
Since it has not been proven that AIDS can be spread through
casual contact, there is no reason to force any infected stu-
dent to leave the university. However, student anxiety about
living with a victim of AIDS must be anticipated. To deal
with this, the university needs to form a committee, compris-
ed of administration, faculty and students, to help determine
what the W&L community believes about this issue. Then a
policy can be formed that is as fair as possible to all involved.

In the beginning, there was a street
corner, and the streets were
Washington and Nelson, and the cor-
ner was the former home of a Coca-
Cola bottling plant.

And the Washington and Lee ad-
ministration saw the corner, and saw
that it was good.

And the administration said, ‘‘Let
there be no more bottling plant, and
no more small house:next door, and
let the contractors come forth from
every corner of the earth and create
upon the earth a new dwelling
place.”

And there were contractors, and
the administration saw that the con-
tractors were good.

Evening came, and morning came,
the first day.

The administration said, ‘Let
there be dynamite blasting the rock
from its stronghold, and let the work
equipment awaken the residents of
the freshmen dorms at unholy hours
of the morning, and the airborne rock

So the construction crews began
their work at unholy hours and
shifted their large machinery into
reverse gear so as to create a pierc-
ing beeping sound, and the dorm
residents cursed and struggled to
regain their sleep, and the ad-
ministration saw that it was good.

Evening came, and morning came,
the second day.

The administration said, ‘Let. the
building be open to upperclass men
and women who desire a dwelling
place nearer to Us, and are willing to
sacrifice individual dwellings for the
convenience of. campus residence,
and who want a weight room, laun-
dry room and computer room at their
ready access.”

So the housing office produced in-
formative brochures, and accumu-
lated the names of those who wished
to reside in such a dwelling, and coor-
dinated the inhabitants of room and
suite, and mediated disagreements.

Evening came, and morning came,
the third day.

And the construction of this dwel-
ling place was delayed by the swell-
ing of the waves and the pouring
down of the skies in the form of snow
and rain. And the site became a
quagmire of mud and stone, and the

And the administration saw that it
was not good, but was unable to im-
prove the situation.

Evening came, and morning came,
the fourth day.

On the fifth day, the administration
saw that the building was progress-
ing, but was still behind schedule,
and was concerned that the dwelling
place would not be ready for the in-
habitants. And it said, ‘Let the con-
struction crew work extra hours,
pouring concrete and laying brick,
installing electric wiring and plumb-
ing fixtures, and preparing the
building for its residents.

So the construction crews worked
ev and weekends, attempting
to have building inhabitable by
the deadline.

Evening came, and morning came,
the fifth day.

On the sixth day, the residents ar-
rived, and found their rooms com-
plete, or nearly so. But the non-
residential areas were barren and
empty, and the laundry, weight, and
computer rooms lay still, and the
gatehouse was incomplete.

And the residents searched the
heavens and the earth for parking

Tye-dye craze is a hard one to figure out

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

The Phi’s Talkback concerning
“tie-dye shirts on campus” was very
educational. A large number of those
questions ‘‘seemed to feel that only
authentic ‘‘Dead Heads’’ are
qualified to wear tye-dye T-shirts.
Much to my regret I didn’t quite see
the correlation so I decided to do a lit-
tle research.

It didn’t take me long to learn that
dead-heads are the subculture of
humanity which follows a band
around while consuming a massive
quantity of drugs while living in
poverty. The band those people
follow around is the Grateful Dead
hence the term Dead Heads. It would
seem that these people must have in-
vented tye-dye shirts and were
known at one time to wear them ex-
clusively until the general population
caught on. And according to the
‘Dead Heads” at W&L these

“Pseudo-Dead Heads”’ have no right
to wear tye-dyes.

I find this ‘‘tye-dye controversy”
fascinating because most of the peo-
ple in my native city simply listen to
music. I believe more definite
guidelines are needed to weed out the
pseudos from the real thing. As un-
fortunate as it is this whole universi-
ty should probably be eliminated
because anyone here does not have
time to follow a band around the
country consuming drugs and let’s
face it — there are no weekend Dead
Heads. Besides, roaming around the
country consuming drugs probably
tend to make one liberal and
Washington and Lee is hardly a
liberal university.

But the guidelines are still too
broad. What if an encyclopedia
salesman from Tulsa can prove he
followed the Grateful Dead around
the country, influenced by various
drugs, in the 60’s? Should this in-
dividual be qualified to wear tye-dye
shirts?

Then there’s the problem that
anyone with some form of transpor-
tation and access to drugs could easi-
ly qualify as a Dead Head. Is the pro-

Mark Twain once remarked, ‘‘the
autocrat of Russia possesses more
power than any other man in the
world, but he cannot stop a sneeze.”’
The Washington and Lee food
cooperative/bookstore/record
shack/stuffed animal center has a
very troubling glass display in the
food cooperative dining area. This
display contains quite a variety of ob-
jects — a Bloom County book, a Far

Side book, and some items new to
W&L this year. There is a major pro-
blem with these new items — a pro-
blem which could undermine the en-
tire system of higher learning in
America.

The first problem is with the two T-
shirts present in the glass display.
The first one reads “W&L Party
Animal.” Unfamiliar with this vague
term, I had to obtain some
background information about it.
“Party Animal’’ is a backward term,
first coined by rednecks and low in-
tellects, meaning one who socializes

Dead Heads should be forced to pro-
ve a relation to a band member, but
then there would not be enough of
them for the Grateful Dead to hold a
concert.

The repercussions of Pseudo vs.
Dead Head go even deeper. What if
other organizations started to adopt
Dead Head practices? What if Her-

Resolving this tye-dye controversy
is not going to be easy but it is a
necessity. If the problem continues
unabated it will divide the country
and possibly result in a tye-dye civil
war. Already it looks to be the main
issue in the ‘88 presidential election.

I failed to mention the other and
more logical method of dealing with
the tye-dye issue which the venerable
professor Cook said best when asked
by the Phi, “No I don’t guess I know
what they are. I didn’t even notice.”’

ing Supreme Court Justice Lewis
Powell. Bork has an impressive
background in the four major areas
of law: private practice, academia,
government experience, and the
judiciary. One of the country’s
leading conservative legal scholars,
he has galvanized the entire range of
ideological opinion like no other in re-
cent memory. The clash over the con-
firmation of the 60-year old Penn-
sylvania native as the 104th Supreme
Court Justice has taken on distinctly
political overtones, and has been
referred to as a “battle for the
Court’s judicial future.”’ Although
conservatives laud him as ‘‘the most
brilliant nominee to the Supreme

#: Court since Felix Frankfurter,’”’ he

has been opposed by Democratic
leaders, black leaders, women’s
groups, labor groups, and civil rights
groups. Bork’s disputatious judicial
concepts have placed him at the
heart of the controversy during a

. crucial point in the history of the

Supreme Court and in the national
political cycle.

The confirmation has already been
mired in partisan politics because of
D)-46 (R) division of the
Senate, the upcoming '88 election,
and the fact that three Senators are
candidates for the presidential

nomination. The Reagan Admini-
stration has muted rhetoric em-
phasizing Bork’s philosophy and
avoided speculation on his future
. voting record. At the same time
vehemently opposed liberals such as

 

Teddy Kennedy charged that under
Bork ‘‘the doors of the federal courts
would be shut on the fingers of
millions of citizens’ and that confir-
mation would bring about a dracon-
ian shift in the balance of the Court.
The primary concern is over the
Court’s multitude of 5-4 decisions,
and therfore Judge Bork’s judicial
philosophy has come under close
scrutiny.

Two related points of contention
have been Bork’s interpretation of
the Founders’ “original intent’’ and
the theory of ‘‘judicial restraint.”
The Justice Department describes
the nominee as ‘‘the most eloquent,
consistent, and brilliant exponent of
the classic theory of judicial
restraint.” Employment of _ this
restraint and of the guide of stare
decisis concerning rights to privacy
have been particularly applicable to
the subject of abortion in the Roe vs.
Wade case. Bork strongly believes
that the role of the Supreme Court is
merely interpretive, not legislative.
He therefore agreed with the dissen-
ting opinion of Justice White, who
stated that the Court had simply
created ‘“‘a new constitutional right
for pregnant mothers and, with
scarcely any reason or authority for
its action, invested that right with
sufficient substance to override most
existing state abortion statutes.”
This position, of course, has not won
Bork any support from women’s
groups or from the pro-choice move-
ment, but he has repeatedly stated
that his criticisms of issues and deci-
sions does not mean that he would
necessarily overturn those rulings.
Bork’s opposition to the manner in
which the 1973 decision was reached
could result in a 4-4 Court split with
Justice O’Connor as the “‘swing vote’’
if Bork is confirmed.

The nominee has also been deemed
“risky”’ by black leaders and official-
ly opposed by the NAACP. Although
this organization is worried about an
attempt to roll back recent gains in
civil rights, there is nothing in Bork’s
background to suggest any
discriminatory bias based upon race.
He has, however, been accused of a
biased support of big business, a free
market economy, and extensive ex-
ecutive power. The Public Citizen
Litigation Group has claimed that
‘‘in split cases where the government
is a party, Judge Bork voted against
consumers, environmental groups,
and workers almost 100% of the time

and for business in every such case”’
and that he “‘had regularly sided with
the executive branch.’ Opponents
again fear reversals of advances
made by organized labor unions and
the repeal of legislation such as the
War Powers Act, which limits the
power of the Executive in times of
crisis without a declaration of war.
Judge Bork’s deference to the ex-
ecutive was pointed out in his role as
the Solicitor General who, on Nixon’s
order, fired Special Watergate Pro-
secutor Archibald Cox. Because of
the similarity between the functions
of the two judiciary posts, the
Judiciary Committee will probably
give Bork’s actions and decisions as
an appellate judge precedence over
past events. While conservatives con-
tinue to promote ork as a centrist or
moderate, liberals have insisted that
he is a legal zealot whose passion will
color his decisions. Robert Bork has
also been an effective witness on his
own behalf, demonstrating himself to
be an articulate, witty man with a
commanding knowledge of the areas
of discussion.

When Bork was first named,
almost everyone in Washington
thought the confirmation would be
fairly certain, but no longer. In the
closely divided Senate the issue may
become a test of party loyalty, and
moderate Southern Democrats (with
large numbers of blacks and unioniz-
ed labor in their constituencies) are
key elements in the undecided bloc.
The Democrats, however, are trying
to avoid their persistent image as
captives of the special interests. The
Administration and its allies see the
confirmation as a chance to leave a
lasting impression on American life.
They deny reports that Bork has
deliberately softened some of his con-
troversial stands to win Senate con-
firmation. Instead, when public opi-
nion appeared to be moving against
Bork, Reagan responded with an in-
tense lobbying campaign aimed at
undecided Senators. It had been
rumored that Orrin Hatch or Paul
Laxalt would be follow-up nominees,
but Reagan recently rejected any
back-up strategy for an alternative to
Bork. Confirmation of this nominee
has become the President’s ‘‘No. 1
domestic priority.’’ After 12 days of
testimony from 110 witnesses the 14
members of the Judiciary Commit-
tee closed the hearings on Wednes-
day. The Bork Nomination will
presumably be sent to the floor with

 

The Ring-tum Phi, October 8, 1987

no recommendation to allow more
time for the undecided Senators to
make up their minds. According to
Senate Minority Whip Alan Simpson,
his present vote count showed Bork
holding a 4 vote lead with 20 to 24
members still undecided.

In my opinion, Senator, your vote
should be one in favor of Judge
Robert Bork’s confirmation to the
Supreme Court position. Since you
have already made the decision not
to run for re-election to the Senate,
the results of a vote in either direc-
tion would probably not affect the re-
mainder of your term, but a strong
party showing may prove to be im-
portant if you choose to run for
statewide office in the future. Also
keep in mind that the female, black,
and unionized sectors of the popula-
tion of Virginia may have strong feel-
ings about a vote cast in favor of
Bork, the repercussions of which
may be felt later. I believe
nonetheless that a vote to confirm
would be in your overall best in-
terests and in keeping with the con-
servative tradition you have followed
as representative of the people of the
Commonwealth.

By Leigh Brown

 

 

On July 1, 1987, President Ronald
Reagan nominated Judge Robert H.
Bork to the Supreme Court to replace
the vacancy left by retired Justice
Lewis F. Powell Jr. His background
includes a variety of important and
influential positions: a solicitor
general under President Nixon, a
professor at the Yale University Law
School, an antitrust lawyer, and most
recently a judge on the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals of the District of
Columbia. Bork first gained notorie-
ty as solicitor general for his involve-
ment in the “Saturday Night
Massacre”’ in which he fired special
prosecutor Archibald Cox, following
the disimissals of Attorney General
Elliot L. Richardson and Deputy At-
torney General William D.
Ruckelshaus. Although Bork had of-
ferred to resign, these two men urged

 

him to remain in order to “protect
the integrity of Justice Department
operations.”

This support has led many to ques-
tion the influence it had over
Reagan’s decision to nominate Bork.
President Reagan, however, has
cited that Bork is of ‘superior in-
tellect, high moral character, and a
champion of individual freedom.”’
According to one Bork supporter;
“Bork is . . . right out of Ronald
Reagan’s ideology.’’ This seems like
the strongest case for Reagan’s deci-
sion, since it is also clear that the
President would want to leave a
lasting impression on the Court with
a strong conservative justice. Fur-
thermore, if confirmed, many see
Bork as the deciding and_all-
important fifth vote, thus influencing
the Court in a conservative direciton.
In which case, Reagan hopes to fulfill
certain “goals” through the Court
which have heretofore been blocked
by Congress.

An important factor in considering
Bork’s confirmation is the influence
he will have on the Court. The
possibility of his being the deciding
fifth vote has caused many special in-
terests groups to state their views.
Ralph G. Neas, the executive direc-
tor of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights, claims that the Senate
may never cast a ‘‘more important,
far reaching vote,’’ and agrees with
Mr. Bejamin Hooks, the Chairperson
of the same organization, who claims
that Bork will ‘alter the balance of
the Court,” thus ‘‘jeopardizing civil
rights achievements for the past
three decades.’’ Opponents see Bork
as a strict interpretational judge of
the Constitution, while Bork sup-
porters contend he is “in the
mainstream of accepted legal
reasoning.”

There is, however, great concern
and dispute over his views regarding
such issues as civil rights, women’s
rights, right to privacy, abortion, the
death penalty, the First Amendment,
antitrust laws, and his regard for
precedent and original intent. These
views were devloped in his writings
and teachings from the 1960s up
through the present. For instance,
according to a report arranged by the
Chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Joseph Biden (D-NJ), it
appears that Bork has ‘‘opposed vir-
tually every major civil rights ad-

 

vance on which he has taken a posi
i... In his views about women’s
rights, he had once stated that the
Fourteenth Amendment applied on!)
to ‘racial and ethnic groups.”

Another concern for the Senate is
Bork’s denouncement of several past
decisions of the Court, such as Roe
vs. Wade, which legalized abortion
“‘nationwide,’’ for he may choose to
overrule them once upon the bench
Judge Bork, however, claims that he
has ‘‘no desire to disturb the body of
law _already....settled.”” Yet his
equally high regard for original in
tent frightens others as well. For ex
ample, he argues that the ‘‘death
penalty is specifically referred to
and assumed to be an available
penalty in the Constitution itself. . .’
and that “the framers explicitly [it|
to be available,’ but is now
“unavailable by the very Constitu
tion the framers wrote.”

The Senate should also consider the
possibility of what Senator Specter
(R-PA) refers to as ‘pronounced
shifts’ from his writings and
teachings as a law professor, and the
views he claims to hold now. While he
asserts that his views as a professor
were more radical and no longer
believed, he also stated in a 1986
radio interview, ‘“Teaching is very
much like being a judge and you ap
proach the Constitution the same
way.”

Should the Senate reject Judge
Bork following this confirmation
hearing, President Reagan will most
likely nominate another candidate
just as conservative as_ Bork,
recognizing the fact that a repetition
of such an analysis as has been made
on Bork will not occur. Furthermore,
this second nomination should pass,
and with more speed. A_ possible
nominee might be Senator Orrin
Hatch of Utah, whose name was also
brought up prior to Bork’s official
nomination. Yet, along with the
special interests groups, many in-
dividuals fear the confirmation of
Bork, as has been shown in the polls,
due to his past views and the in-
security they feel with his new ones
For these reasons, the Senate will not
confirm the nomination in the in
terests of the people and of the Court,
and I also advise you, Senator
DeConcini, to do the same.

‘Student activity groups receive budget cuts from EC

 

"By John Starks
+ Staff Reporter

 

Using the $100 activities fee levied
» on each W&L student, the EC

allocated $139,650 to 21 student
* organizations last week.

That figure was reached after the
budget hearings last Wednesday
+ night at which student groups re-
‘ quested funds.

+

+ This being a Mock Convention
, year, the spread between EC alloca-
tions and organization expectations
« was wider than in previous years.
No group received all that it sought
*and only a few have minimal dif-
,ferences between their requested and
apportionments.
* As the EC “budget director’, Vice-
.President Pat Schaefer said, ‘It’s
Mock Convention year...Student
*groups need to cut back a little...to
Bet the Convention (rolling) The

eyes of the country are on Lexington
for two days.”

But other groups “understand the
crunch” caused by Mock Conven-
tion’s needs according to David
Grove, who spoke for the SAB

The SAB topped the EC budget for
both requests and allocations, seek-
ing $57,700 and getting $42,000.

SAB chairman Sean Coyle said
they really expected to get $48,000
since it would have been only $2,000
more than last year. But he added,
“‘We’re happy with the $42,000.”’

Schaefer said that SAB will just
have to cut out a couple of weekends
and not spend so much on the year’s
big concerts.

EC rep Powell Starks suggested
higher ticket prices for entertain-
ment. Grove replied that that had
already been done.

Coyle emphasized that the SAB has
received suggestions to diversify the
kinds of music played by the bands

they hire. In order to take risks with
jazz and folk concerts, he said, ‘“The
extra $6,000 would have been very
helpful.”

Coyle is confident that SAB ‘‘won’t
go over budget’’ since they plan to
have better bands that cost less
money per concert.

Another group affected by EC cut-
backs was Trident.

The women requested $2,100, but
received only $500.

Schaefer explained, ‘‘Larger
organizations like Trident have more
members than most of the groups
that need EC funds, so they have
more potential for other means of
fund raising.”

Trident president, Alston Parker,
replied, “Larger membership means
larger costs.”’

Schaefer added that most of the
Trident budget was for social events
which the EC will not fund, in accor-
dance with past EC policy.

‘Co-op congestion confounds

 

*By Heidi Read
, Staff Reporter

 

+ “Get rid of the Party Animal
stuff,”’ is junior, Tom Moore’s solu-
tion to the co-op space dilemma.

« Some students expressed the need
for a bigger building while others like

*junior, Nancy Whalen said, “I can’t

«See the space for it [a bigger co-op].
It’s more of a luxury than a necessi-

*ty.”’ Senior John Coll thinks ‘‘it’s kind

» of quaint the way it is.”’

These student comments were
“sparked by a petition in the Co-op for
, a bigger facility.

The petition was put up by junior
“Meredith Walker to aid University
, Food Services director Gerald Dar-

“ rell in effort to find out the level of

» student interest for a bigger co-op.

, W&L administrator Frank Parsons
said that at this point there is no solu-

«tion to the Co-op delimma, but hopes
to review some plans for action this

"November.

He recognizes the imminence of
*the situation, and said the Co-op is on
,the University’s priority list.

Whether it be a remodeling or a new

‘building, Parsons hopes to keep the

,Co-op in its central location ‘‘just a
hop, skip, and a jump from classes

‘and the dorms.”

He added, ‘‘it’s a complicated issue

and there is no quick fix to it.”

* As is, the situation is a traffic jam

,during the lunch rush between 11

a.m. and 2 p.m. Although the Co-op is
doing good business with a figure of
about $850 for lunch, students must
contend with long lines, few or no
empty seats, and slow service.

The seating situation is easily solv-
ed in the warm months of September
and spring term, but what to do in the
winter?

“In the winter the Co-op is more
crowded and people that normally sit
in ODK circle move inside. They
don’t necessarily eat, but just hang
out before class and get something to
drink,” said Walker.

The greater influx of students is
also the result of the cheaper prices
at the co-op as opposed to the Dining
Hall.

“Students that don’t want a full
meal from the dining hall eat in the
Co-op. It’s quicker, less expensive
and they can order what they want,
instead of having to eat a whole
meal,’’ commented senior Chris
Gareis.

Because of its central location, the
Co-op gets more business than the
GHQ or the dining hall. Students pass
by on their way to and from class and
from the dorms. With Gaines Hall
finished, even more traffic passes by
the Co-op, adding to its congestion.

Snack bar ichard Arm-
strong said that-the point card is the
major cause of the co-op’s iggrease in
business.

Since college students are always
short on cash, all they need to do is

Se

pull out their ‘blue card’ ana the
cashier crosses off the points. No
cash needed, for the point card can
be charged home.

“Tf W&L students can charge
anything home, they will,” said
Whalen.

Armstrong added that he would
like to see a new and bigger co-op
with increased seating space and a
larger selection of items, somewhat
like a convenience store on campus.
However, he added that the Snack
Bar stuff was ‘‘doing their best to get
the food out, and the students need to
have patience and try to understand
the situation.”

Some students felt that co-
education was one of the reasons for
the busier Co-op — a kind of social
outlet during the week, a place
students could go to take a study
break and know they’d see their
friends there.

As Coll put it, the result of co-
education at the Co-op is that ‘they
sell more chicken salad platters.”

What is the solution to the Co-op
problem? None of the students inter-
viewed seemed to have a solution,
but some possibilities may be tearing
down the building and starting new,
or remodeling the existing facility
with additions.

One of Parsons’ ideas conceived a
whole new. building directly. across
from the outside bookstore entrance;
across the parking lot from the C-
school. The building would be built on
a slope like the library.

 

 

*W&L’s first married undergrads, Craig and Carolyn Garneau.

‘W&L couple adapts to marriage

 

.
By Stephanie Guittard
+ Staff Reporter

 

Mr. and Mrs. Craig Garneau are
* W&L’s first undergraduate couple.
They are the ones that get pointed
out to new students as “‘the ones who
” , are married.”
There have been previous married
* students, but those women had
, transfered in, and Carolyn Garneau
has been at W&L since her freshman
» year.
This made them the university’s
* first “‘real’’ espoused pair. Craig is a
senior and Carolyn is junior.

Mrs. Garneau, formerly Carolyn
» Arbogast, was a freshman when she
met Craig at a party her roommate
gave for the swim team.

She said she did not remember
“meeting him, but does remember
wanting to see him two weeks later at
another party.

Their first date was Jan. 25, 1986,
and they were engaged twenty-six
days later. On Aug. 1, 1987, they were
married

‘We had originally planned on get-
ting married after, at least, I
graduated but if you get engaged,
generally you want to get married.
And we had the ability, we could pay
for it. Might as well do what you want
once ina while,” Craig explained.

Carolyn expressed that their
, parents were very supportive. “They

’

°

were in favor of it; they saw nothing
wrong with it.’’

The Garneaus found that their
friends reacted very strongly to their
engagement, though.

“It was about half and half,”’ Craig
explained. “‘Some people were just,
‘What are you doing? You're ruining
your life, you idiot!’ And other peo-
ple, ‘‘Oh, I’m so happy for you!”’

Life has not changed too much
socially for the Garneaus since their
marriage, especially for Carolyn,
having been engaged since her sixth
month of her freshman year.

“It’s not so much that [our social
life] has changed since we’ve gotten
married, it changed mostly when we
got engaged,”’ Carolyn said.

“We don’t go down the road a
whole lot, but we’re both fairly busy,
so we don’t do a lot that’s spon-
taneous anyway. It’s a little bit of a
change,’’ admitted Craig.

He added that occasionally they
are excluded because they are not
single, but not often enough to make
a difference.

Reactions by those other than the
Garneau’s close friends has been
amusing at times.

“It was more the freshmen coming
in this year,’’ Carolyn explained.
“There'd be some guys at our
friends’ house, and they’d say
something, and all of a sudden it
would occur to them, and, ‘You're
married? Oh, I’ve heard about
you!’ ”’

By Mathew Horridge/The Ring-tum Phi

Craig added, ‘‘We’ll be serving in
the D-hall, and someone’ll say, ‘I'll
have the peas, and, you’re the one
who’s married!’ Yes, anything
else?”’

The couple has at least the next few
years planned, as Craig will grad-
uate in the spring.

“T plan to go to graduate school,
and she plans to finish up at W&L
next fall and then go and get her
teaching certificate where ever it is I
am, or close to that, so she’ll be able
to graduate with her class. We’ll pro-
bably only be apart for three months
or so,”’ Craig commented.

Carolyn will transfer in twelve
credits for winter and spring term in
order to receive her diploma at W&L.

If Craig goes to UVA, she’ll go to
Mary Baldwin. If he goes to Harvard,
she’ll go to Bates College in Maine.
At any rate, she had planned to spend
that time somewhere else, because
W&L does not offer teaching cer-
tificates.

Craig is in the ROTC program and
has applied for the reserves so he will
be able to attend graduate school
while fulfilling his obligation to the
Army

If he does not get into the Reserves,
he will have to live on a base, but
chances are that Carolyn will be able
to be with him

Craig and Carolyn Garneau’s life
as married undergraduates is flour-
ishing, and, as Craig put it, ‘I recom-
mend it!”

Parker noted that Trident did
“400% better than last year’’ when it
received $100. In general, the women
are pleased with the allocation

The Ring-tum Phi asked for $18,000
to cover the costs of computers the
paper needs to buy, but only received
$16,000.

Business Manager Rhona Hughes
said that the Phi will need the other
$2,000 which she hopes can be ac-
quired with ‘‘better advertising and
more subscriptions.’, Yet she also
said, “Compared to what other
organizations got, I’m happy with
(the allocation).”’

Three student journals appealed to
the committee for funding: The Jour-
nal of Science, the Ariel, and the
Political Review.

Each increased its requests from
last year to accomodate an addi-
tional issue.

Starks asked those in charge of
these journals if they were aware of

the many potential sources of funds
for such works. He and other EC
members suggested that they check
the Development Office for lists of
potential donors.

The EC agreed to fund the costs of
one edition of each student journal.

The Minority Student Association,
the International Club, and the In-
dependent Union received less than
their requests primarily because of
the EC policy on social funding.
Receiving $700, $600, and $600,
respectively, they fell well short of
their initial requests of $5,700, $1,680,
and $1,100.

Schaefer expressed sympathy for
these “‘small groups that don’t have
the fund raising capacities of larger
organizations.”

Eight athletic clubs made appeals
to the EC and many were seeking to
expand due to increasing student in-
terest.

“It’s just on the year for expan-

sion,’ said Schaefer, citing Mock
Convention’s draw on the EC
treasury as a major reason.

He also asked about the possibility
of some support for these clubs from
the Athletic Department.

Overall, Schaefer and the rest of
the EC expressed to all student
organizations ‘‘the need to find
sources other than EC.”’

“There is only so much money to
go around and we didn’t want to raise
the student tax,’’ declared Schaefer.

He added, ‘‘We gave the budget a
lot of thought. It wasn’t a rush pro-
cess.”

The EC heard requests from 6:30 to
11:15 p.m. Wednesday night, and
deliberated until 2:00 a.m. Thursday
morning.

Now with the budget established,
the EC begins the weightier task of
holding to it, for a usual, many stu-
dent organizations will return
throughout the year to appeal for
more money.

Beer sales down,
hard liquor up

 

By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

 

Drinking beer is probably one of
the most popular activities at the na-
tion’s colleges. Ask any student,
watch any movie, and it will only
reinforce the sentiment that beer
drinking in college is practically a
way of life.

Or is it? According to Miles Nye,
owner of Kelly’s Corner, a local
establishment popular among W&L
students for its sale of beer kegs,
beer consumption has dropped con-
siderably — possibly as much as 50
percent.

Nye, who sells beer to 13 of W&L’s
17 fraternities, said that whereas last
year he sold 432 kegs of Busch beer in
the month of September, he sold only
256 kegs this month. He says that the
1,103 kegs of Busch he’s sold this year
is down considerably from the
average. (Busch is by far the most
popular choice of beer because of the
price and availability, according to
Nye, who added that he does a ‘‘spat-
tering of business’’ on such brands as
Budweiser, Old Milwaukee and
Coors.

“Washington and Lee students]
are not drinking nearly as much as
they have in the past,” he said.

Although Nye attributes some of

the drop in sales to the change in the
state drinking age to 21, he says most
of the drop in beer consumption is
due to an increase in University
restrictions on social functions.

“The school seems to regulate par-
ties a lot more,” said Nye. ‘“‘Wednes-
day night parties used to be as big as
weekend parties but not anymore.”

Nye added that ‘‘a fair amount”’ of
people are now purchasing beer in
small quantities, such as 6 or 12-
packs, which has also resulted in
fewer keg purchases. But Nye said
that he has seen an even larger in-
crease in the sales of hard liquor —an
increase which he calls ‘“‘much more
dangerous.”’

“Young freshmen who aren’t used
to drinking can’t handle the hard
stuff like grain,’ said Nye, who says
that kegs are much safer.

“They should ban the use of liquor,
not beer kegs,”’ said Nye. ‘You can’t
take kegs down the road. When you
serve beer from kegs the party stays
in one place — not on the road.”’

Diane Potter, manager of Stop-In,
a convenience store that sells beer in
six and 12-packs, said that W&L
students make up a lot of their
business.

Big Brother Sister program grows

 

By Cheryl Bowles
Staff Reporter

 

The number of students involved in
W&L’s Big Brother/ Big Sister pro-
gram has increased greatly this
year.

The program pairs W&L students
with Lexington area children, pro-
viding them with attention and com-
panionship they cannot always get at
home.

Garrett Moseley and Melissa
Thrasher, the students in charge of
the program, say this year more than
35 students applied to be a big
brother or a big sister. Moseley, a
senior, says that he has never seen
such a large response from students
in his four years of involvement with
the program. Moseley and Thrasher
are still in the process of matching up
students with kids.

The Big Brother/Big Sister pro-
gram receives a budget from the
university, which is used for the an-
nual Christmas party and other ma-
jor group activities.

Thrasher maintains that the pro-

gram operates mainly on an in-
dividual basis, where the pair can do
its favorite things together.

The program is part of the Univer-
sity Federation, which also sponsors
a candlelight service at Christmas in
the Robert E. Lee Episcopal Church
for the Lexington community.

Moseley and Thrasher think stu-
dents get involved with the program
to make W&L students visible as ac-
tive members of the Lexington com-
munity.

“It’s a way of showing W&L in
more of a communal, volunteer at-
mosphere,”’ said Moseley. Thrasher
added, “It’s a positive way of
representing W&L to the communi-
yy,”

In addition to being fun, the pro-
gram gives students a greater sense
of appreciation and giving.

“It’s really neat when W&L
students realize how fortunate they
are and are willing to give something
to somebody else,’’ said Moseley.
Laughing, he added, ‘‘It teaches you
if you want to have kids or not!”’

Thrasher said, ‘there are a lot
more kids in Lexington than people

think.’’

All children crave attention, and
the Big Brother/Big Sister program
provides them special relationships
with people who want to give atten-
tion.

Five schools in the Lexington area
provide the program with kids who
are either recommended by a
guidance counselor or have voiced in-
terest themselves.

‘When you're little, you’re
honest,”’ said Moseley. Thrasher’s
little sister Ceon said, “‘My mother
asked me if I wanted one [big sister],
and I said yes.”’ She said that a lot of
her friends have big sisters, too.

Last year the group went to King’s

Dominion, which Ceon thought was

the best thing they did last year.
Thrasher said that the trip was a
total success.

Entertaining a child is not difficult.
Ceon said that her favorite thing to do
with Melissa is to go out to eat at the
Golden Corral.

The Big Brother/Big Sister pro-
gram at W&L is successful as well as
rewarding to both the big and the lit-
tle participants.

Nye said that, while his main goal
is, of course, to sell beer, he honestly
believes it is safer to allow frater-

ing hard alchohol.

Nye added that 99 percent of
his Busch beer keg business is
from W&L students.

 

 

 

Scott Stimpson (L) instructs Scott Robertson in Karate.

Law student teaches Karate

 

By Francis Coryell
Staff Reporter

 

Every Monday and Wednesday,
the Doremus Gym is turned into a do-
jo for the Shorin-Ryu karate class.

The class is open to anyone who
wishes to participate. The class has
currently 9 law students and 7
undergrads.

There is a $30 fee each semester,
plus all students are required to have
fighting equipment, mouthpieces,
and cups, all of which can be pur-
chased through the class.

Scott Stimpson, a 2nd year law stu-
dent, is the instructor for the class.

Stimpson started taking karate
four years ago at Butch Marino’s
Shorin-Ryu Karate Institute at the
University of Maine. He became a
black belt in three years and has ex-
perience teaching at the University
of Maine and in Connecticut.

Last year Stimpson started teach-
ing here during the winter semester.

“T didn’t want to get away from
karate. Teaching helps’ me
remember what I need to remem-
ber,” said Stimpson.

The class lasts up to 2 hours. The
first thirty to forty-five minutes are
used for stretching and calisthenics,

Young Democrats membership increased

 

By James Midkiff
Staff Reporter

 

The Young Democrats started off
the year with a bang, swelling the
ranks of the club sevenfold after their
first meeting.

Kristi Goodman, president of the
young Democrats, said that she ‘“‘was
shocked by the enthusiasm at the
irst meeting.”

The increased interest in the
Young Democrats on a campus
iistorically dominated by the College

Republicans organization may be an
indication of a more diverse student
body, according to Goodman.

The Young Democrats currently
have about 35 members, up from last
year’s membership of five.

The College Republicans, on the
other hand, currently have between
40 and 50 dues-paying members sign-
ed up, according to Greg Dale, the
chairman of the organization

Dale says close to 200 people have
expressed an interest in his organiza-
tion, but he estimates that the actual

uumber of dues-paying members will
be closer to 100.

Both Goodman and Dale think that
a stronger Young Democrats
organization will help stimulate
political debate on campus.

Goodman says that the Young
Democrats will work to get rid of
apathy on campus through a variety
of activities, including three fund-
raising projects as well as communi-
ty service projects. The group also
plans to sponsor Democratic
speakers.

Goodman and Dale hope that the
two clubs can work together on some

projects, perhaps debating political
issues from their respective view-
points publicly or in print.

The officers of the Young
Democrats are; Kristi Goodman,
president, Nancy Hickam, vice presi-
dent, Paula Owsley, secretary and
Bob Martin, treasurer.

The organization is independently
financed by fund-raising projects

and the $15 each member pays
as dues. ‘I'he Young Democrats

will try to meet every two weeks,
with the next meeting scheduled
for Oct. 15

which include pushups, situps and leg
raises.

Usually the repetitions in one of the
exercises are extended each class.

The stretching is not the easiest
thing to do. Since flexibility is the key
to many of the manuevers needed in
karate, the cry, “‘stretch til it hurts.
Does it hurt yet?!’ is often heard
from Stimpson.

The Monday night class is for
katas. Katas are a series of techni-
ques created by the masters in order
that one may be able to practice
alone.

For a student to move up from a
white to a yellow belt, he must pass
basics, which cover stances, turns,
blocks and punces, and three katas.

Also, to move up in rank, it’s up to
the instructor’s discretion whether or

APO serves

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

 

Alpha Phi Omega is a service
fraternity through which Washington
and Lee students provide volunteer
service to Lexington and surrounding
communities.

The members of this fraternity are
part of a unique organization
dedicated to helping other local
organizations through various pro-
jects and services.

Some of the local associations that
have benefited from APO’s help in
the past are the Boys’ Club, the Lin-
coln House and Rockbridge Regional
Library. The Lincoln House, a men-
tal health care center, received some
help from APO volunteers last week
in chopping firewood.

Other members of APO stacked
books at the Rockbridge Regional
Library. Last year APO members
provided tutoring, interior painting
and a pinball machine to the local
Boys’ Club.

Rather than having a set, planned
agenda of projects, APO just takes
them as they come. ‘We try to re-
main flexible,’ said Vice President
John Deighan.

fighting increases as rank increases.
Often a fight is interrupted by Stimp-
son to give instruction to the fighters.

“We contact people in the com-
munity and let them know who we
are...and if they have something (a
project) along our lines, we’ll help
them out,’’ said Dean Nuckols, Presi-
dent of APO.

The service fraternity keeps a
calender of planned social events and
a few set dates for special service oc-
casions. One such special event is the
Adolescent Day Program, planned
for October 24. When a school for the
mentally retarded will have its in-
terior walls painted by some APO
brothers.

Not everyone may have been
familiar with APO last year, since
the fraternity was still in its early
stages.

APO spent much of last year peti-
tioning for a charter, and became an
official school organization this year.

Response to the group has improv-
ed considerably as compared to last
year. This is, in part, ‘because we’re

a little more organized,’ says
Deigan.
APO presently has ten active

members. About fifteen students will
pledge on October 15. The organiza-
tion has two women members. One of
the women, Dorothy Mills, serves as
Vice President of Membership this
year.

Polish professor adjusts to W&L

 

By McLaurin Hill
Staff Reporter

 

There’s a visiting teacher at W&L
this year: Krzsylof Jasiewicz from
Warsaw, Poland.

He is teaching three courses this
term — Special Topics in Sociology:
Social Movements in Poland,
Eastern European Politics and Socie-
ty, and Social Theory.

He came to the United States ‘‘to
complete my research in the field of
political culture. Because of some
economic constraints in Poland, the
most recent works are not
available.”

He came to W&L after doing re-
search in the field of political culture
at Harvard and teaching during the
summer session there as well. He has
also done many guest lectures during
his fourteen months in the United
States, including Yale, Columbia,
UNC at Chapel Hill, and the Universi-
ty of Kentucky.

Before he came to the U.S. he did
research and taught at the Polish
Academy of Science since he

graduated from the University of
Warsaw in 1972 receiving his M.A.
Degree.

Jasiewicz says there are major dif-
ferences between the Polish system
he said: “The students come to the
University when they are nineteen or
twenty with a very good background
in general education. So, they come
and usually spend five years. There
is no B.A. so they graduate with a MA
or a MS Degree.

The curriculum is somewhere in
between undergraduate and
graduate. The expectations of the
students are different. I taught
Students that would write their MA
thesis the same year, or within a
year. The classes in Poland are
designed a specific way: a formal
lecture, not any time for questions,
and a post-seminar discussion group
to discuss some issues or some
readings.”

When asked about W&L, he said, “‘I
very much like W&L. I believe that
the way W&L is arranged is probably
the most productive for the students,
the size of the school, the size of the

classes. The students can profit from
the professors in such an institution.”

About the students here, he said,
“They are very good students. I
would be happy if my students were
less shy and more active in class.

“They have a legitimate right to
question what the professor is say-
ing. Not only at W&L, the
undergraduates could be more active
and put more pressure on the pro-
fessor. This system gives the pro-
fessor a chance to get feed-back from
the students. That’s why I expect the
students to be more active and less
shy in classes.”

The students at W&L think Pro-
fessor Jasiewicz is an excellent
teacher.

‘“‘He’s always prepared. The class
requires us to do the reading. It’s a
good class, really informative,” said
Andrew Hart who is taking East
European Politics and Society.

According to Hart, the class is
usually divided into one third in-
troduction of a subject and two thirds
discussion.

Sycamore Farms offers fresh local produce

 

By Rob MacPherson
Staff Reporter

 

Are you looking for some home
made bread or some fresh fruit and
vegetables?

How about a six-pack or a bottle of
wine?

If any of the above ies tickle
your fancy, then you should pay a
visit to the Farm Market at 14S. Ran-
dolph St. in Lexington.

Owned and operated by Bruce and
Betty Jane Becker, Sycamore Farm
offers a wide range of food and
beverages to the Lexington com-
munity in what the owner called a
“no-nonsense” fashion.

“This place is what it says it is,”
said Becker.

“There is nothing fancy about this
joint. We make all of our stuff from
seratch and we bake it right here,”
he said.

Becker also said that all of the fruit
and vegetables are grown on his
farm and brought in fresh everyday.
He added that when goods are in
season and in large demand
shipments are made twice a day.

Becker said he will not carry an
item that doesn’t meet his personal
standards.

‘‘People want good, honest
vegetables,”’ he said.

‘‘Here, homegrown means
homegrown.”

In addition to his homegrown
goods, Becker said that he also car-
ries homemade jams and_jellys
which he buys from a woman in Lex-
ington.

“T stock local produétion because I
think community involvement is im-
portant,”’ he said.

Becker also said that he finds it
easier to control the quality of his
goods when he knows the supplier
personally.

Originally, Becker owned a small
store in Kerr’s Creek about six miles
outside of Lexington. When he learn-
ed that a lot of his business was com-
ing from people living in Lexington,
he decided to bring his goods to them.
By moving to Lexington, Becker ex-
panded his store and his sales.

‘“‘We’re doing well,” he said. ‘‘The
average sale for a specialty store is
good,” he added.

Becker said that eventually,

Sycamore Farms, Lexington’s new grocery store, located on Randolf Street.

Sycamore Farm will be offering take
out dinners in addition to groceries.
The featured dinner entrees that
Becker mentioned include a shrimp
and scallops combination dish, pot
roast, barbecued ribs and chicken.

Becker said that he will also offer two
other items which will vary week to
week. He said that each entree will
include a baked potato, cole slaw and
hot bread.

“T would like my dinner entrees to

be an alternative to the fast food in
the area,’’ Becker said.

The Sycamore Farm Market’s is
open for business from 7:30 a.m. to
8:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday.
The store is closed Sundays.

‘W&L polo members play summer tournaments

 

By Shawn Crawford
Staff Reporter

 

This past summer three members
of the W&L water polo team traveled
to southern California to participate
in several tournaments while work-
ing as lifeguards and swimming in-
structors.

Senior Simon Perez, junior David
Dietz, and sophomore Adam Morgan
arrived in Fullerton, Ca., in mid-
June to find that summer water
sports abound in the southernwestern
US.

‘The quantity of water polo played
out in California is mindboggling.”’
said Morgan. “There were tour-
naments almost every weekend. I
think the best part of the trip was the
amount of playing time I had. I
played in about four major tour-
naments where at home in Baltimore
I probably would have played in only
one.

Perez agrees saying, ‘‘To play five
days a week, twice a day, was fan-
tastic. Had I not gone, I wouldn’t
have played all summer.”

The three practiced from 6:00 to
8:00 a.m. with Sunny Hills High
School and from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m.
with Santa Anna Junior College.

The rest of the time was spent giv-
ing instructions in swimming,
lifeguarding, or resting up for the
next grueling day of practice.

Dietz had less R&R, as he took a
full time organic chemistry course
(in which he made an A), and
Morgan was able to play more polo
because of his age bracket When
asked if he thought the experience
was helpful to their quality of play,
Perez’s answer was definite.

“The whole team had an opportuni-
ty to go. Since there were only three
of us, and we need six people for a
team, toward the end of the summer
we were able to play very well
together.’ he said.

Morgan also noticed im-
provements in their play, saying, “I
noticed we played better as a unit.
We developed an intuition as to what
the other person was doing.”

He also believed that the practice
helped during The Southern League
Tournament last weekend, where the
team managed to win four games
and rallied in the second half of their
game with The University of Arkan-
sas to close a wide scoring gap.

“T think the players need to play
under different programs and
coaches."’ said Head Coach Page
Remillard. ‘I think it’s good for
them. It has certainly helped our pro-
gram because we are competing
against people who are doing that all
the time.”

The players stayed with Jim
Spragues, who coaches at Sunny
Hills and who came to W&L as direc-
tor of a polo clinic.

Impressed with the quality of play

here, be made available a chance to
come to California for a summer
clinic.

From that point it was up to the
players to decide if it was advan-
tageous for them to participate.

Because of NCAA regulations,
neither Coach Remillard nor any
other administrator was able to sway
their decision.

“T knew what they were going into
so I could articulate what they
could expect,”’ said Remillard.

Staying at the Sprague residence
helped to ease the expenses ac-
cumulated on a tirp of this nature.

‘‘We were very fortunate that they
put us up,”’ Perez said.

As for the remainder of their earn-
ings, both Perez and Morgan stress-
ed that they had no intention of trying
to save money, and that it was used
to pay for the living and travel ex-
penses incurred during their trip.

“Lifeguarding paid about five-fifty

Perez admitted to making enough

to make the trip possible.

Though he is supportive of what
these three men did, as well as the
playing time other members of the
team were able to find over the sum-
mer, Remillard said, ‘‘I’d be surpris-

cellent opportunity to learn from an
excellent teacher from a communist
country. In addition to the enormous
value of the cultural points, he’s an
excellent teacher in Sociology. More
people should have taken advantage
of it.”

Kennon Savage, who is taking the
Social Theory course agreed. ‘‘He
knows every detail. He asks ques-
tions that require a lot of thought. He
demands a lot of us.”

Charles Shearer takes his Special
Topics in Sociology course. He said,
“It’s really elucidating. He’s a very
nice man and most importantly, he
really knows what he’s talking about.
He’s very much on top of what he’s
speaking about. He’s really in-
terested in student output.’’

Coming to W&L was the realization
of a dream for Professor Jasiewicz.

He said, “‘I came to this country as
a fellow at Harvard. I realized I could
extend my stay for one year. I
wanted to experience teaching at a
small university. I was dreaming
about it.”’

He is returning to Warsaw at the
ehd of the school year.

Hunters stand ready.

All this activity is pretty im-
pressive considering the center will
not complete construction until the
spring of 1989.

The seven-million-dollar complex
is being built on 378 acres located
about three miles north of Lexington.

Phase I of the center, including
four fireproof stables, a covered
arena, a training ring, a traditional
show ring, and an entry pavilion, is
nearing completion. Most of the
buildings are finished and workmen
and expecting to complete the final
two stables by the first of the year.

Phase II of the center will include a
45,000 seat indoor arena, dressage

rings, and a Grand Prix ring. The

 

design for the indoor arena, which
may include a show ring, box
seating, regular seating, and a
restaurant, is still under considera-
tion, according to Frank Bierman,
Director of Facility Programs. Pro-
bably the last building to be con-
structed, the indoor arena is slated
for a spring 1989 completion.

The center will also eventually
have a network of trails and a polo
field.

“We just
horseman everything he
possibly want,”’ said Bierman.

The Virginia Horse Center is state-
owned and run by a board of direc-
tors appointed by the Governor. Ap-
proximately $2.5 million of the
centers $7 million cost will be paid
with state funds. The remaining
amount will be paid for from the
private sector.

The idea for a state horse center is
not new. It was first discussed in a
1969 report for the Commission of the
Industry of Agriculture’s Horse In-
dustry, according to Jim Sharp,
equine specialist for the Virginia
Department of Agriculture and Con-
sumer Services, in an article in the
Lexington News-Gazette. The
General Assembly passed a resolu-
tion in 1980 creating a legislative sub-
committee to study the feasibility of
building a Virginia horse center.
Communities throughout Virginia
began submitting proposals for the
location of the center. In June of 1984,
the subcommittee visited each pro-
posed site, and after extensive
review, the subcommittee unani-
mously agreed to recommend the
site that is now the horse center.

According to Frank Bierman, the
committee selected the Rockbridge
site from among 16 proposed sites for
several reasons. The site was the
largest tract of land of all the pro-
posals. It was located at the crossing
of two major traffic corridors, In-

terstates 64 and 81, and is generally
located in the central part of
Virginia. It is only 45 minutes away
from Roanoke’s airport.

The area’s interest in the center
was also a contributing factor in the
selection.

“The City of Lexington, the city of
Buena Vista, and Rockbridge County
all got behind the Virginia Horse
Center,” said Bierman.

“They all said we're going to work
as a group to get this horse center.
We want this horse center and we will
make the commitment to have this
horse center.”’

The Virginia Horse Center even
tually will have facilities to ac-
comodate all breeds and disciplines
of the horse industry. In particularly

caters to sales, 4-H Judging, Grand
Prix Jumping, Reining Classes,
Dressage, Breed Shows, Eventing,
Cross-Country, Cutting, Polo, Trail
Riding, Hunter/Jumpers, Driving,
and Pony Club. There has even been
interest in having an International
Endurance Ride in 1989 with the trail
extending from Roanoke to the Horse
Center.

Groups wishing to use the Horse
Center rent out the facilities they
need. Riders bring their own feed,
because ‘‘everyone likes to feed their
horse a bit differently,’’ said Bier-
man. The stables have spaces for 500
horses, with nine wash racks for
horses and showers facilities for
their owners. There will also be cam-
ping sites available for owners who
would like to stay on the premises.

Center’s economic influence disappoints

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

“Not much has happened so far,”’
said Blake Brandon, owner of Hunter
and Huntress, a shop specializing in
equine and hunting supplies.

That seems to be the reaction of
many businesses in Lexington to the
assumption that the Virginia Horse

‘enter will increase revenue for area
shops.

The Horse Center held its first ma-
or event, The Blue Ridge Quarter
forse Association Show and Futuri-
y, during the weekend of Aug. 28-29.

The three-day event brought in 350
horses, trainers, and exhibitors from
seven States. The event brought in an
estimated revenue of $30,000 for the
quarter horse association, according
to an article in the Richmond Times-
Dispatch.

Robert Reel, executive director of
the center, estimated that the
center’s 1988 schedule of events will
bring in $6.2 million dollars to the
Lexington area.

However, during the weekend of
the quarter horse show, ‘“‘the town
was like a ghost town. Most of the
local people who would normally be
downtown were at the center,” said

Don Fredenburg, manager of
Historic Country Inns, which in-
cludes the McCampbell Inn and the
Alexander-Withrow House.

Maxine Holland, manager of The
Best Western Keydet-General, said

she polled her guests on the weekend
of the quarter horse show and found
that not one of her guests was atten-
ding or was associated with the show.

“All of us thought it would be a suc-
cess overnight, and things just don’t
work that way,”’ Holland said.

Brandon said that she set up a
booth at the show displaying items
sold in her shop.

“We didn’t sell anything,” said
Brandon, She attributes the lack of

The Board of Directors are all af-
filiated with the horse industry, and
their knowledge of horses shows in
the details of the center.

“The board wanted to go first class
all the way, and I think it shows. The
stalls are so well thought out, with
vertical mesh on the inside of the
doors so a horse can’t hang a shoe on
it. They paid special attention to the
latch on the doors,”’ said Bierman.

“The same thing with the central
ring. They paid a _ tremendous
amount of attention to the lighting
grid. That’s one of the best lit arenas
I’ve seen.”’

If some students have their
way, Washington:and Lee will add
riding to its list of intercollegiate
sports.

Marguerite Ayers, a W&L
senior, is trying to start a womens
riding team to compete with other
colleges.

Ayers rode while she was a stu-
dent at Hollins College, winning
the regional competition, and go-
ing on to compete at the national
competition.

Washington and Lee has several
excellent riders among its women
students, said Ayers.

Tait North, a freshman, is one of
those riders. North won first place
in the Pony Club Nationals, quali-
fying to go on to international
competition in Australia (the na-
tional team didn’t go because of
lack of funds.)

“T’d love it [if W&L formed a
riding club],” said North.

North plans to board her own
horse in Lexington during the
winter term, so she can practice
regularly. Because she is ranked
number one nationally and
therefore can teach classes, North
has been contacted by the local
fox hunt and pony club members,
who have offered to board her
horse.

from the stables all from one spot in
the pavilion.

The fencing is made out of a special
plastic that won't splinter if a horse
kicks it and will never need painting.
Bierman says the extra cost will be
worth it later on.

“If you do haphazzard work, you
will just have to come back at a later
date and replace it.’’

Among the events scheduled for
the Horse Center in the next month
are the Virginia Dressage Associa-
tion South West District Dressage
Competion (Oct. 17), The Rockbridge
Hunt Hunter Trials and Driving Com-
petition (Oct. 18), the National Sanc-
tioned Cutting Show (Nov. 2 and 3),
and the Buena Vista Chamber of

Wa&L students to
form riding team

North said that while the type
riding she loves is not the type
that competes inter-collegiately,
she is still interested in being on
the riding team.

For this year, Ayers is hoping to
organize Sévéral women students
who already have riding ex-
perience into a team.

“The problem we have right
now is that most other schools
have horses, facilities and a
coach. We are concerned with the
capacity to teach [riding] at
W&L,”’ said Ayers.

In order for the team to com-
pete, they will need ‘‘some ex-
perienced riders who can throw
their leg over a horse once a
month and be competitive.”

Ayers said the only re-
quirements a rider must have are
experience and correct riding
gear — boots, jodphur pants, and
riding jacket. The intercollegiate
competitions supply the riders
with horses.

The riders on the team will try
to find practice horses individual-
ly, hopefully from area owners
who need someone knowledgable
to exercise their horses, said
Ayers.

The Intercollegiate Horse Show
Association also requires a $50
membership fee to allow
Washington and Lee to compete.

“I think it’s pretty reasonable to

sales to the number of vendors at the
show from outside the area.

Because the event was catered,
very few of the participants of the
show came into town to eat.

‘We did a small amount of food
business,” said Cindy Green, sales
representative for the Lexington
Holiday Inn and Fox Hunt
restaurant.

John Keykendail Jr. of the Golden
Corral! Restaurant said he noticed an
increase in their business during the
weekend. of the show. Keykendall
estimated that business has increas-
ed 10 to 15 percent since the opening
of the center, ‘especially in late
night business.”’

Keykendall said most of the late
night customers were dressed in
“cowboy attire’ and came in after
the show ended. The restaurant is
open until 11:00 on Fridays and
Saturdays and until 10:00 on Sun-
days. .

show, primarily with tourists, not

the fighting. I always wanted to learn
karate and it’s great for flexibility.

John Nicolas takes the class

weekends, but Green said she is hop-
ing the horse center will bring in
business during the slower winter
months.

“The big shows are scheduled on
already big weekends around here,”’
said Green, citing a possible reason
for the lack of horse show people at
the already-full motel.

Though the immediate results are
disappointing, many merchants are
waiting to make final judgments.

“I think it’s premature to say or
write anything on what it will do,”
said Fredenburg, ‘‘We do anticipate
that it will do something.”

“I’m hoping it will be beneficial,”
said Holland, “I guess for us it’s a
wait and see. I don’t think there have
been enough activities to really
judge.”

Brandon said several area mer-
chants are working with the Lex-
ington Downtown Development
Association to get visitors to come in-
to Lexington, rather than staying at
the center.

Among the ideas being considered
is sending a single merchant to
represent all of the Lexington shops
at each function, advertising in a per-
sonal manner while still allowing
most shopkeepers to remain open,
according to Brandon.

“Serious money will [eventually]
be coming in,” said Brandon, ‘“‘so it’s
good we’re learning now.”’

“This was important not only in the
W&L community, but stressed inter-
nationally as well,’’ said Cockey.

Cockey gives a lot of the credit for
improvement to the house corpora-
tion and the house mother Mrs. Vogt.

“The award was good for the W&L
fraternities because there is so much
bad publicity. We gained a lot of good
recognition among our community
and that is good for W&L,” said
Cockey.

Virginians support lottery

 

By Jim Hodge
Staff Reporter

 

A majority of Virginians are in
favor of passing the long-disputed
Virginia state lottery referendum,
according to a Richmond Times-
Dispatch poll.

The poll, taken in September,
shows 66 percent of the registered
voters in favor of the lottery, 29 per-
cent opposed and 5 percent undecid-
ed.

The elections this November will
not be the the first time the lottery
referendum has come up for a vote.

In September, 1978 a Richmond
Times-Dispatch poll showed that 54
percent of the registered voters in
Virginia wanted a state lottery. The
referendum was stopped by an unex-
pected surge of conservative voters.

Currently the lottery receives its
strongest support from Northern and
Eastern Virginia and the least sup-
port in the Shenandoah Valley.

Former Attorney General Mar-
shall Coleman argues the state will

lose sales tax and other tax revenue
on the money spent on lottery tickets.
He says the state will have to spend
more on law enforcement and
welfare because the lottery will in-
crease crime and poverty. Coleman
is doubtful of what he calls the lottery
supporters’ prediction — that a state
lottery will bring in an extra $200
million a year for Virginia.

Ken Storey, public relations direc-
tor of “Virginians for the Lottery’,
retaliated by saying the $200 million
estimate was made, not by the sup-
porters, but by the Senate Finance
Committee. Storey also claims that
Coleman is using ‘‘scare tactics’
—predictions of increased crime and
poverty — to discourage voters from
supporting the referendum.

Storey says the lottery will help
pay off some of the $1 billion in
capital outlay projects for state
universities and colleges, hospitals
and other public facilities.

Though the polls show Virginians
in favor of having a lottery, no one
can be sure of the outcome until the
issue is decided by voters on Nov. 3.

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team evened out their season
record to 3-3 Tuesday afternoon with
a close 1-0 win over Roanoke on
Smith Field.

The game was obviously a defen-
sive battle from the start to finish.
Sophomore Jack Pringle had an
outstanding performance in goal,
allowing Roanoke only mere
thoughts of an actual score. The
game went into overtime, tied at 0-0.

With about four minutes left in the
first part of the overtime, sophomore
Rick Silva (commonly referred to by
the crowd as ‘‘Young Rick’’) was
finally able to blast a shot right into
the back of the goal to put the
Generals on top.

The second part of the overtime in-
tensified on the part of both the
teams and the crowd. At least three
questionable, if not absurd, yellow
cards were given out to W&L players
within a five-minute period.

This provoked comments from the
crowd like, ‘‘Wait! That guy over
there doesn’t have one yet.’ and
“Hold on. Who doesn’t have one
yet?”

Sophomore Christian Eckman
commented on the team’s perfor-
mance after the game. ‘I think we
played really well, but we also had a
lot of help defensively from our
goalie, Jack Pringle,’ he said. He
also said the Generals may not have
taken advantage of as many oppor-
tunities as they should have, but the
“team seems to be coming
together.”

Head coach Rolf Piranian said, ‘‘I
thought our defense did a really good
job.”” He thought both teams were
simply playing outstanding defense
the entire game.

The Generals are now 3-3 overall,
but own an impressive 3-0 Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference record. The
team will get an opportunity to con-
tinue their three-game winning
streak, Saturday at 3:00 against
Messiah College on Smith Field.

Washington and Lee women’s soccer
game against Hollins is, ‘“We should
have won “

Both the players and the coach of
the team were confident of victory.
Yet the final score was 3-2 in favor of
‘Hollins, and head coach Janine
Hathorn and several team members
blame both physical and mental fac-
tors for the loss.

“Since we expected victory, we
were too complacent,” said Hathorn.
“It seemed as if, after a while, we
couldn't conquer the mistakes
although we played hard.”

Freshman Cary Baber described
the W&L team as having ‘‘a strong
first half, where we were in control
and allowed no shots.”’ As for the out-
come, Baber said, ‘‘We have a ten-
dency to play better against more
challenging teams.”’

The highlights of the game were
the goals scored by sophomore
center forward Catherine Baillo and
junior center mid-fielder Alexa
Salzman, as well as what Hathorn
describe as an ‘“‘exceptional perfor-
mance”’ on the part of freshman
goalie Sherri Brown.

™| Women remain winless

On Tuesday, after an exhausting
double overtime, the final score
against Randolph-Macon Women's
college was 2-2. Again, attitude
seems to have been a hindrance, con-
sidering W&L had 40 shots on goél
—as opposed to R-M’s eight — in the
first half.

‘‘We were over confident at 2-0, arid
we paid for it in the second half,”
observed freshman Rachelle Nock.

The game’s” scorers were
sophomore center fullback Sarah
Allen — who also had an assist — ahd
junior right wing Catherine Chris-
tion.

Another double overtime in Satur-
day’s game against Lynchburg
resulted in the score of 2-1 for the op-
position. However, this time there
were no regrets about any part of the
performance. W&L knew they were
competing against an excellent
team, and proceeded to respond well
to the challenge. ‘

With an assist from freshman
JuLee Messerich, sophomore left
midfielder Mary Alice McMorrew
scored the only goal. Even though a
defeat, the game is considered to be a
promising display of both new ard
old talent.

Generals outgun; Gilbert outruns Randolph-Macon, 35-28

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

W&L quarterback Phil Sampson
told the Richmond Times-Disptach
last Saturday that he wasn’t too
familiar with the Randolph-Macon
Yellow Jackets. ‘‘There’s a girl's
school near here called Randolph-
Macon, but I can’t comment on it
more elaborately than that.’’

Well, Sampson now knows a little
bit more about Randolph-Macon
(0-4), but the sophomore QB pro-
bably wishes he didn’t, as the Yellow
Jackets gave the Generals all they
could handle in a 35-28 Old Dominion
Athletic Conference thriller.

On their way to the victory, the

Generals (2-1) used just about every
play in the book. Head coach Gary
Fallon’s ball control offense took the
day off, as Washington and Lee tried
everything from Sampson-sneaks up
the middle to 47-yard TD receptions
by split end Hugh Finklestein to
power running by senior tailback
Chris Coffland and sophomore full-
back Russ Crosby.

As tough as the day was for the
W&L offense, the defense had to work
just as hard. Although it did allow
Macon senior running back Remon
Smith nearly 300 yards rushing, the
W&L defense was able to hold the
Jackets when it counted most. Twice
junior linebacker Tom Skeen in-
tercepted passes inside the W&L 10-
yard line, and the Generals ended the

last Macon drive of the game by
holding on fourth down. As Fallon
later put it, the W&L defenders “‘sort
of bent every now and then, but they
never quite broke.”

But even_the we’ll-try-anything of-
fense and the we-won’t-break defense
weren’t enough, as the Generals had
to call on their kickoff receiving team
to pull off the win. After the Jackets
went ahead by one with less than four
minutes remaining, freshman Carl
““Sweetness”’ Gilbert took the ensu-
ing kickoff 82 yards for the winning
touchdown.

Randolph-Macon started the scor-

‘ing on a 5-yard run by Smith late in

the first quarter, and sophomore
Mark Palmgren’s kick gave the
Jackets a 7-0 lead. But W&L’s Cof-

fland was in the end zone less than
two minutes later, and freshman
Carter Quayle kicked the extra point
to tie the score at seven.

The second quarter began with the
Yellow Jackets driving, but Skeen
ended that threat with his first in-
terception of the day, picking off a
pass by Macon QB Rick Kline at the
‘10-yard line. The Generals drove 55
yards in five plays, only to turn the
ball over on fourth down at the
Yellow Jacket 27.

After the W&L defense forced
Randolph-Macon to punt, the
Generals drove to the three-yard
line, where Sampson hit senior split
end John Roe with 2:21 remaining in
the half. Quayle’s kick gave W&L a
14-7 lead.

16 WEST WASHINGTON STREET

The Generals forced another
Macon punt with less than a minute
left, but Sampson needed only 26
seconds before he threw to Finkles-
tein for a 47-yard touchdown bomb.
All of a sudden, the Generals were up
21-7, and what had been a tie ball
game less than two minutes earlier
threatened to become a blow-out.

In the third quarter, however, the
Jackets showed that the game was
far from over. Macon scored with
8:15 left in the third quarter on a 31-
yard pass from Kline to senior Scott
Lincoln, and Palmgren’s extra point
cut the W&L lead to seven.

The Generals responded by driving
50 yards in eight plays, scoring on a
nine-yard pass from Sampson to
Finklestein. Quayle’s try for point

failed, leaving W&L on top, 27-14,
with just under five minutes left in
the third quarter.

The Jackets quickly went to work,
driving 76 yards in less than four
minutes and scoring on a four-yard
carry by Smith. Palmgren’s kick
made the score 27-21 with 54 seconds
left in the third period.

Things soon went from bad td
worse for the Generals. Washington
and Lee’s Bob Martin fumbled the
kickoff, giving the Jackets the foot
ball at the W&L 40. But Skeen’s sec;
ond interception of the day kept
Macon from taking the lead, at least
for the time being. 4

U. of A. and official

’

down Polo in final

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

“We was robbed!”’

This is what W&L fans were
mumbling to themselves as they filed
out of the seats at Cy Twombly Pool
after Sunday’s Southern League
Tournament first round champion-
ship game. The Washington and Lee
water polo team lost to the Universi-
ty of Arkansas, 13-11, but an official’s
call or non-call may have proved to
be the deciding factor.

With eight seconds left, the Razor-
back’s goalie had the ball and was
about to put it into play. Water polo
rules state that a player has three
seconds to make the ball live by
either throwing it to a teammate or
by giving it a quick toss and catching
it. The U. of A. goalie performed the
latter, and junior David Reavy, mak-
ing a heads-up play, knocked the ball
‘out of the goalie’s hand an into the
goal, apparently tying the score at 12.

“We pulled the goalie out to
pressure their six field players and
their goalie,” said Reavy, a co-
captain, ‘‘and the goalie was in front
‘of the goal and he put [the ball] in
play. As soon as the ball is put into
play you can either foul the guy or do
whatever you want to him. He put the
ball in play and we slammed it in.”

But the referee disallowed the goal,
so the Generals’ come-from-behind
bid came up short. The Razorbacks
were also awarded a penalty shot as

the buzzer sounded, which gave thena
the 2-goal margin of victory.

_ “The referee was a novice-level
referee,’ said head coach Pag
Remillard. ‘The quality of the gam
and the pressure ot the game was
way beyond him. He later admitted
that he didn’t know what to do. It was
just kind of like ‘I’m not going to let ”
the game end that way.’ He didn’t
call the rules.”’

Remillard also said that the ofr
ficial’s call was not the reason why
the Generals, 15-2 on the season, lost
the game.

“My first reaction would be to say
that the referee blew it,” he said»
“But then earlier in the game I saw a
play where he blew it and we scored a’
goal. So I can’t hang my head over,
the fact he missed a call with eight
seconds left.”’ .

?

The controversy ended what could
have been a miraculous comeback’
for the Generals. W&L won posses-,
sion from the outset of the game and,
less than a minute later, had a 1-0 ad-r
vantage. But it was a short-lived
lead. As the Generals looked on’
shellshocked, the Razorbacks, un-,
ranked nationally but ranked No. 1 in
the Southern League, racked up six*
consecutive goals to take a 6-1 lead at
the close of the first period. ,

ed to play,” said Remillard.
“They're an outside offensive team.
We know that they can shoot with in-
credible power and accuracy from
the outside. We needed to make some
adjustments.”

Adjustments are just what the
Generals successfully made.
Pressuring the outside men in Ar-
Ransas’ offense, W&L played the se-
cond quarter even at two goals
apiece and went into halftime trail-
ing, 8-3.

“We pressed the ball to our offense
to force them to spend their energy
playing defense,’ said Remillard.
“That worked. That changed the
game. They never got back to of-
fense.”’

Remillard made another change in
the second half, pulling deep-end
goalie sophomore David Olson and
replacing him with shallow-end
goalie junior Tom Rawls. Olson
allowed the six goals in the first
quarter, but Remillard said the move
was more a psychological ploy thana
punishment for poor play.

“‘When I made the change, I had to
make confidence changes,” he said.
“The field players blamed the goalie.
Rawls had the momentum. The team
had the support. They were behind
Rawls — they knew he was blocking
things.

“It also indicates that I believed we
could still win it. A lot of times a guy
is doing a good job, but you need a
mental effect, you still make a
change. Olson wasn’t hurting us.”

What also wasn’t hurting the
Generals was an extremely vocal
crowd. With W&L beginning to make
its comeback, the fans started to get
into the game and help shift the
momentum of the game to the
Generals’ side.

“Our fans really made a dif-
ference,’’ said Remillard. ‘They
believed we could come back, and
their enthusiasm helped us and pro-
bably put some doubt in the minds of
the Arkansas players.”’

With the noisy crowd erupting at
every W&L goal, the Generals cut in-
to the Razorbacks’ lead and trailed
by only three, 10-7, going into the
final stanza.

The Generals were in possession of
the ball and trailed by a single goal
three times at 10-9, 11-10 and 12-11.
Then came the mayhem with eight
seconds remaining.

Senior Simon Perez scored eight
goals to lead W&L, and junior David
Dietz chipped in four. The Generals
beat Mary Washington 23-2, UNC-
Wilmington 23-12, Richmond 13-6,
and George Washington 12-5 prior to
meeting Arkansas.

Unlike last year’s rival, Richmond,
Arkansas is a team that W&L re-
spects and looks forward to playing
in the future.

were forced to punt six plays later.
Starting at its own 27, Randolpb-
Macon drove 73 yards in six minutes.
Smith scored on an eight-yard carry,
and Palmgren’s kick gave the
Jackets the lead for the first time
since the first quarter, 28-27, with
3:45 left.

That set up Gilbert’s game-winning
TD. The freshman fielded the ball at
his own 18 and started up the middle.
‘We were just hoping for something
really good to happen, and gosh it
sure did,’’ said Fallon. Gilbert said
one saw a hole for the return just
after he fielded the ball. ‘‘The block-
ing was just tremendous,’ said
Gilbert. ‘‘Sweetness’’ cut to hi left
just short of midfield and raced the
last 50 yards untouched. The
Generals went for two on the conver-
sion attempt, and Sampson’s com-
pleted pass to Roe closed out the

scoring in the General’s second vic-
tory in theirlast two games.

HASHMARKS-—Sampson completed
15 of 24 passes on the day for 239
yards and three touchdowns. For the
season, Sampson’s passing effiency
rating stands at 146.3, giving him a
firm lock on second place among
ODAC quarterbacks... Finklestein
caught six passes for 137 yards and
two touchdowns against Macon. For
the season, he leads the ODAC in
receiving yards and receptions per
game and is tied for the lead in total
receptions. ‘‘He’s just come up with
one big play after another,” said
Fallon. ‘‘Hugh is going to be very im-
portant.to our offense.” Finklestein
may also be important to the W&L
defense. Playing defensive back,
Finklestein picked off a Rick Kline
pass to end the first half... Through

three games, Skeen leads _ the
Generals in interceptions (2),
unassisted tackles (39),

assisted tackles (14) and total tackles
(53)... The W&L-Macon game went
down to the wire for the second time
in as many years. The Jackets won in
Lexington last year, 21-20, on the
final play of the game.

Homecoming game sees a hungry Maryville

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

The Maryville Scots have lost all
three of their games this season, but
Washington and Lee head coach
Gary Fallon said that fact doesn’t
make him feel any better about

' Saturday's Homecoming match-up.

“I'd probably much rather play a
3-0 team,” said Fallon. ‘A hungry
team is a dangerous team, and I’m
sure they’re not very happy down
there.”

The Scots have scored only 16
points this season, compared to 82 for
their opponents, but Fallon said

GENERALS!

Maryville does have some talented
players on offense. Quarterback
Mike Human returns for the Scots.
He completed 11 of 17 passes for 243
yards and two touchdowns against
W&L last season. But Fallon said
Human is not starting this year; he’s
been replaced by Thomas Russ, a 6-0’
180-pound junior from Gainesville,
Ga.

Fallon said Russ, “‘possesses a lit-
tle stronger arm and a little better
quickness”’ than Human. Maryville’s
leading receiver is senior split end

Scots are capable of an all-out pass-

bad weather has kept Maryville from
airing the ball out too much this year.
“We think they possess possibly
more of a threat offensively than
Randolph-Macon,”’ said Fallon.
‘Maryville has a better quarterback,
they have good running backs and
their receivers are quite capable, so
our defense is in for a long day and a
tough day, unless they perform a lit-
tle better than they have.”
Defensively, Fallon said Maryville
is similar to Centre. ‘They persue
well, they swarm to the ball, and
they’re young and enthusiastic.”’ The
defense is dominated by under-
classmen, with “seven or eight

The Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team had a difficult
time of it last weekend, losing to Nor-
folk St., 19-37.

The Generals, coming off an im-
pressive race the week before in
which four runners broke the school’s
all-course record, literally ran into
trouble at the hilly 3.1-mile course in
Salem, Va.

“We're not quite as ready as I
thought we were,”’ said head coach
Jim Phemister, whose team is 0-2
this season. We’re making progress.
I thought we could run against them
more successfully than we did.”

Freshman Paige Cason turned in
another impressive performance,
finishing second in a time of 20:43.
Freshmen Heather Jenkins (7th) and
Lovell West (8th), and senior
Stephanie Smith (9th) and freshman
Wendy Wilson (11th) rounded out the
scoring for the Generals.

The times in the meet were higher
than the last meet, a fact Cason con-
tributes to the weather and the dif-
ficulty of the course in
the first meet against Mary Wash-
ington was mostly flat while the

course in Salem had more hills and
was, for the most part, run on grass.

“Our times went up because it was
cold,” said Cason. ‘‘Also, the course
was hilly, something we were not
quite ready for.”’

Phemister agreed. ‘Realistically,
with a younger team without much
experience, any new race situation
—different competition, harder
course — is always harder for them
to adjust to than the seasoned team.”

Phemister also pointed out that,
although the Generals did not run
poorly, there is still a lot of room for
improvement.

“There’s too much of a gap bet-
ween our first runner and our next
four,’ he said. ‘“They are still not
able to help each other our as much.
They don’t have anybody to help
break up the rest of the pack. But all
that is developing.”

On Saturday, the Generals will
travel to Newport News, Va. to com-
pete in the Division II and III State
Meet. Phemister sees this as an ex-
cellent opportunity for the team to
gain more experience.

“It should be a good race for us,”
he said. ‘“‘There will be more people
against whom are people can run and
compete.”’

Roanoke is ‘better team’

in defeat of

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

Two weeks ago the Washington and
Lee men’s cross country didn’t run
well in a shutout loss to Mary
Washington. This past weekend in
Salem, Va., even an excellent effort
might not have been enough to lead
the Generals to victory over Roanoke
College.

W&L defeated the other team, Nor-
folk State, 41-57, but it was th ex-
cellence of the Maroons that was just
too much for the Generals to handle.

“Well, we got beat by a better
team,”’ said head coach Dick Miller.
“Roanoke ran very well together.
They are not too deep but their top
four are very good.”’

Those top four, Dwayne Stover,
Tom Linden, Paul Walters and Brian
Falls, all finished before the No. 1
General crossed the line. Senior co-
captain Scott Rippeon was fifth
overall with a time of 28:52 over the

x-country

five-mile course. Junior Bill Clark
(6th), senior Richard Moore (7th),
freshman Larry Pilke (9th) and
senior co-captain Rick Norris (14th)
were the other scorers for W&L.

One thing the Generals did not
have to worry about at this meet was
the course. Roanoke unveiled a
brand-spanking new course which,
like W&L’s, is hilly and challenging.

“{Roanoke] ran on a new course
which is an excellent course,’’ said
Miller. “It’s a very comparable
course to our course, in the sense that
it’s rolling and on grass except for
one spot, which I consider a plus.”

The Generals will get a chance to
run on their own course, Saturday at
11:30 a.m., when they take on Cath-
olic University. Home course advan-
tage, however, does not insure a
cakewalk for W&L.

“As far as I can find out, Catholic
has one or two pretty good people,”
said Miller. ‘‘Other than that, I don’t
know much about them.”

‘Fatal Attraction’’is a killer

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Over the last year there have been
countless reports on the dangers of
casual sexual relationships in rela-
tion to the deadly disease we know as
AIDS. AIDS is nothing. If casual sex
in the United States is a problem,
then watching the film ‘Fatal At-
traction” is the solution.

“Fatal Attraction’ is easily the
most intense film to come to the
screen in at least a decade. Though it
draws from such thriller classics as
“Jagged Edge,’”’ ‘Dressed to Kill,”
“A Stranger in the House,” and
Hitchcock's ‘“‘Psycho,”’ it far sur-
passes them all in both intensity and

‘People’ opens

 

Staff Reports

 

The VMI Theatre's fall production
of Ordinary People will open at
Virginia Military Institute during
Parents Weekend, Oct. 15-17, with a
second series of performances on the
nights of Oct. 22-24.

VMI first classman ~.awn P.
Evans and Lexington High School
senior Robert Henneman will share
the lead role of teenager Conrad Jar-
rett. The story concerns the struggle
of Conrad and his family to get on
with their lives after the death of
Conrad’s older brother in a boating
accident.

The play, dramatized by Nancy
Gilsenan from the novel by Judith
Guest, will be presented at 8 p.m. in
the Scott Shipp Hall theatre at VMI,
with two dinner-theatre evenings of-
fered on Oct. 23 and 24. For the
dinner-theatre evenings, a buffet will
be served in the officers dining room
in Crozet Hall, with patrons making
the short walk to Scott Shipp for the
play.

The parents in the production will
be played by Lexington police
sergeant Torben Pedersen and
Cheryl Flint of Buena Vista. Col.

in quality. Director Adrian Lyne has
blended just the right amount of hor-
ror, suspense, and macabre to keep
you on the edge of your seat with your
heart in your mouth.

The film seems simple enough for
the first hour. Michael Douglas plays
a lawyer who has a one-time affair
with Glenn Close while his wife is in
the country visiting her parents. The
next day, Douglas realizes what he
has done and goes over to break
things off with Close. They talk, and
begin listening to Puccini's
‘Madame Butterfly.”’ In a nice piece
of foreshadowing, Douglas and Close
begin to discuss the passage they are
listening to, where the sailors leave
Madame Butterfly and she kills
herself. Like we don’t know what is

Michael S. Harris, professor of
modern languages at VMI, will play
the role of the psychiatrist, Dr.
Berger, and Lexington High School
senior Juliet Thompson will play
Conrad Jarrett’s girl friend Jean-
nine. Rounding out the cast are
Cadets James J. Stepnowski and
John R. Gentry, Washington and Lee
junior Elizabeth Fowler, and Lex-

coming next. Close slices her wrists,
but Douglas saves her and stays to
make sure she is all right.

Douglas calls the next day, Close
says she is all right and apologizes.
All is well, have a nice life, end of
story.

Yeah, Right!

For a second, you begin to wonder
why everyone and his brother is rav-
ing about such a simple, non-exciting
film. About that time however, Glenn
Close’s irrational side not only takes
her off the deep end, but slams her
around the bottom for a little while.
She begins sitting in the dark flipping
the lights on and off, she makes stew
out of the Douglas family pet, and she
kidnaps a little girl. At this point,
calling her a psychopath is being

generous.

The last hour of the film is a roller
coaster ride of terror, emotion, anx-
iety, and fear that culminates in an
ending that will bring you out of your
seat. This is not the kind of movie you
need to see on cocaine or Jolt Cola.

Michael Douglas, Glenn Close, and
Anne Archer are all quite good, but
any award for the film should go to
Adrian Lyne. His direction of this
film is excellent and will put it into
the realms of thriller classics.

Don’t miss this movie! It’s ex-
citing, interesting, and Ann liked it.
“Fatal Attraction” is a film ex-
perience that you will not soon forget.

Children burn in Wilderness

 

By Greg Unger
Music Critic

 

Reunion Wilderness is the name of
The Railway Children’s introductory
U.S. album. And what a debut! They
had a single in Britain (‘‘A Gentle
Sound”’) that sent U.S. lables and
programmers into paroxysms of
delight and left them clamoring for
more. Far away in Britain, Gary
Newby and the guys heard their
prayers, signed with Virgin Records,
and now give us what could quite
possibly be the best new release of
the year. Imagine Echo and the Bun-
nymen and The Stlye Council singing
slightly less militant Aztec Camera
lyrics and you’ve got The Railway
Children.

What makes this album so strong is
that it has no weaknesses. The
Railway Children are well-produced,
talented musicians, performing
meaningful music. They sound good
and hear well. The first side,
especially, is as close to perfection as
imaginable. All 6 of the tracks on the
‘‘A”’ side are great. Are some greater
than others? ‘Yeah— “A Gentle
Sound’”’, ‘‘Another Town’’, and
“History Burns’. ‘‘History Burns’’ is
the strongest track on the album.
“Another Town” reminds me of The

Style Council’s ‘‘Everchanging
Moods’’. ‘‘Content”’ is sandwiched in
here someplace—but don’t overlook
it. It simply takes the rather mellow
pace of this album to a higher plane.
“Brighter’’ begins the ‘‘B’’ side
and ranks up there with ‘History
Burns”’ as the strongest _ track.
“Brighter” has been getting air-time
at WLUR and could be the group’s
real breakthrough single. ‘‘Careful’’
is yet again Style Council-ish with a
slightlier funkier beat (for what
that’s worth). “‘Darkness and Color”’

also stands out on this flip side as
smacking slightly of Billy Bragg—
simple, yet eloquently so.

! suppose by now you realize that I
like this album. You will too. It
should appeal to anyone with any
semblance of musical taste—not just
progressive fans, but also to those
with more established, entrenched
tates. I think we'll be hearing
quite a bit from these fellas as they
become more established. A boon for
Echo & The Bunnymen Fans.

WLUR
Adds
special

shows

By Greg Ossi
Staff Reporter

 

 

WLUR, the campus radio station,
has added a new feature to its
weeknight programs. The show is
called 11:30 Special and like the title
suggests it airs starting at 11:30 p.m.
and lasts until midnight. It will be
featured Monday through Thursday
with a different program every night.

Monday the show is called the
Feature Album Feature and will
highlight one album by playing it in
its entirety.

Tuesday’s show is called New
Track Record and will be featuring
the new releases of the week.

Wednesday the show is called In-
terchords and will be interviews with
today’s hottest bands.

Thursday’s show, The Local Music
Report, will be half an hour with the
area’s top musicians.

This is a new step for the station in
providing more interesting and
diverse programming to entertain
the listener. As Rock Director Rob
MacPherson said, ‘‘if you can hear it
on K-92 or some other station, we
don’t want to play it.”

‘University outlines measures to improve frat houses

.

.

°

’

By Andy Nixon
Staff Reporter

 

New regulations and the results of
an architectural survey may force
W&L fraternity houses to do some
housekeeping.

Last Thursday a Fraternity Steer-
ing Committee introduced new
supervisory measures to all the
fraternities. The eight page docu-
ment is the work of a Fraternity
Committee composed of Alumni,
trustees, students, faculty and ad-
ministration.

The report outlines various aspects
of fraternity business, from main-
taining an annual budget to the ap-
pearance of the fraternity house, giv-
ing responsibilities to the University,

the Interfraternity council, the na-
tional fraternities, the house corpora-
tions, local chapters, and the chapter
house.

The regulations reinforce the com-
mitment of the University to the
fraternity system by repeating,
“social fraternities are a valuable
and integral part of both the Univer-
sity and Lexington communities.”

This statement “keeps in the
spirit’ with the Board of Trustees
May 25, 1985 ‘Policy Statement
Relating to Campus Life.’’ The coun-
cil again reiterated the ‘‘spirit’’ of
these reports, however, by stating
that fraternities “have important
privileges as well as responsibilities
to those communities.”

The “responsibilities” cover all
aspects of fraternity life, but the
most visible will be changes to the

- Texas man charged

The decomposed remains of a
homicide victim found by Virginia
highway workers May 27 have led to
the arrest of a Texas man, but the
identity of the victim has left in-
vestigators scratching their heads.

The body was found over the bank
of the southbound lane of Interstate
81 near exit 50 south of Lexington. In-
vestigators say the man had been
shot in the stomach or chest area
with a revolver-type weapon on or
about May 19, 1987.

John Stephen Swartz, a 35-year-old
truckdriver from Channel View,
Texas was arrested Aug. 15 in Texas
and charged with the murder. Swartz

" was extradited by Commonwealth’s

'

.

Attorney, Eric Lee Sisler.

Swartz picked the man up at a
truckstop somewhere in Virginia, ac-
cording to Lonnie Craft, a Special
Agent of the Bureau of Criminal In-
vestigation in Salem. Craft said

evidence found on the body and vehi-
cle identification led them to Swartz.

Swartz aided investigators in com-
piling a sketch of the victim, who he
described as a white male, approx-
imately 21 years of age, 5 feet 4 inch-
es tall with brown hair. The victim’s
identity is still under investigation.

The man used the name Chris, ac-
cording to Swartz, who said the vic-
tim was seeking work as a lumberer
and was planning a hike, possibly on
the Appalachian Trail. Swartz said
the victim had mentioned being in
the military, and said he was wear-
ing military issue eyeglasses, an Ar-
my shirt, loafers and a brown coat.

Swartz has been charged with first-
degree murder and the use of a fire-
arm in commission of a felony.

The criminal record of the accused
is not yet known, according to Sisler,
who said the records have not yet
come through the Criminal Record
Exchange because of a delay in pro-
cessing. :

A preliminary hearing is set for
Oct. 30 in Rockbridge county General
District Court.

local houses themselves

The code requires certain by-laws
such as forbidding drug use, defining
the role of officers, guidelines for
alcohol use, prohibiting firearms,
academic achievement, and so on.

The houses are subject to physical
standards alone. For instance,
fraternity appearance must ensure
that it “is compatible with the
neighborhood. Kept in good condition
at all times. Has landscaped grounds
conforming to a_ professionally
designed landscape plan approved as
part of its renovation plan.

“The list includes fire safety,
building codes, a party room with
sound absorption capability, and
good dining and kitchen areas.”

In short, the fraternity must

“Provide bed and bath facilities of a
quality at least equal to the best

residence hall accommodations pro-
vided by the university.”’

Currently, a Charlottesville ar-
chitectural firm is surveying the
fraternities to determine the
feasibility and expense of the frater-
nities meeting the University re-
quirements.

This survey consists of a ninety
minute interview with the officers of
all fraternities, and should be finish-
ed before Thanksgiving. Upon re-
ceiving the report, it is the job of the
trustees to, in Dean Atkin’s words,
“allow funds to be procured in some
way.”

The University’s guidelines are not
meant to hinder the fraternity sys-
tem, Dean Atkins stated, ‘‘because
we know the importance of frater-
nities. We just want to have the best
ones around.”

Catherine Christian made history
Saturday afternoon as the first
Washington and Lee undergraduate
to be crowned homecoming queen
—although only moments before be-
ing crowned, she was busy playing
soccer for the women’s soccer team.

All this, yet Christian seems to be
pretty low-key about it all.

“Of course, I didn’t expect to win,”
she said matter-of-factly. “I was
very flattered, not to mention very
lucky.”

Christian, a native of Chapel Hill,
North Carolina, said she was asked
by Phi Delta Theta the week before
homecoming to be their represen-
tative.

Homecoming Committee informing
me about the interview to be held the

At tonight’s meeting, said Londrey,

7 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Londrey explained that the
meeting was established to give
freshmen a better idea of whom
they’re voting for. So often it’s been
based upon word of mouth, It’s our
objective to make the freshman class

more involved than in the past.’’

The stiffest area of competition is
the race for EC representative, in
which there are fifteen candidates.

To reach the voters, candidates
have been busy putting up posters
and handing out leaflets and
resumes. Most have been doing their
best to meet as many people as possi-
ble, and a few have even gone from
door to door in the dorms.

Some freshmen are having a hard
time deciding which candidates to
choose.

Freshman Trey McClendon com-
mented, ‘‘It’s a popularity contest.”

Freshman Eric Harlan said, “It’s
similiar to Rush in that you are not
given the oppurtunity to get a good
look at all the possibilities. Options
are limited to the few you know.”’

Londrey noted that, “The fresh-
men who really take an initiative will
stand out.”

Freshman Willard Dumas said,
“The important thing is everyone
getting out and participating in the
election.”

The polls will be open from 9 a.m.

be located in the Davis and Graham-
Lees quads and in the ODK Circle.

This year’s Voting Regulations
Board is making an attempt to get
freshmen involved in their class
elections by sponsoring a fresh-
men class meeting to get the
freshmen familiar with the
canidates.

Bill Londrey, VRB Chairman,
says the idea of holding the forum
in Lee Chapel at 7 p.m. tonight is a
great one.

“Even if the candidates don’t
say anything meaningful, it’s a
chance for freshmen to connect
names with faces. Hopefully,

 

some people will take advantage
of the meeting and say something
relevant and the cream will rise to
the top,” said Londrey.

VRB Vice-Chairman June-Ho
Lee said the meeting should
become an annual tradition.

“Freshmen candidates will
have to introduce themselves to
the whole freshmen class. Thus,
the freshmen class will be able to
see the candidates’ faces rather
than just names on the ballot,”
Lee said.

“We're hoping the whole
freshmen class will show up.
We've stressed the importance of
it. We're hoping for a good turn-
out,”’ Lee added.

Londrey said high attendance at

the meeting would be a sign of in-
terest among the freshmen class.

“Tt’s not apathy, but a lack of in-
formation that causes low voter
turnout,”’ stressed Londrey, who
said he hopes the meeting will
take care of that problem.

Besides sponsoring class meet-
ings, such as the one tonight, the
VRB has been working to
eliminate problems that have
plagued past elections—such as
misspelled or missing names on
ballots.

A sample ballot was posted on
the Executive Committee door for
candidates to check the spelling of
their names earlier this week.
Londrey said this has been helpful
in reducing the number of com-

Voting Regulations Board encourages frosh awareness

plaints by candidates.

“Every year there are com-
plaints,’’ Londrey said, “but we
leave it up to the candidates to
make sure [names] are correct.” |

“This year freshmen have two
days to correct misspelled names
on the ballot. This is to make sure |
everyone’s name is on the ballot
and spelled correctly,’’ said Lee. |

“One problem we are trying to
avoid is a lack of voters,’ Lee ad- |
ded. |

Londrey said he would be happy
with any voter turnout above 70
percent.

Londrey said the VRB would be
spending $70 on this election,
which will be held Monday, Oc-
tober 19th, from 9 a.m. to4.p.m

W&L hires a new security officer

 

By Marguerite Ayers
Staff Reporter

 

With more girls at Washington and
Lee University these days, more
campus housing to attend to and
complaints of strangers being on the
grounds of the university, W&L will
have a new full-time security guard
starting Oct. 19th to oversee the
dorms at night.

‘We figured we needed someone
close around the dorms at night to
check on things and quickly respond
to complaints, especially where the
girls are,’’ said Charles ‘‘Murph’’
Murray, the University Proctor.

Horace ‘‘Hew’’ Blair will be the
new man for the nightime shift. He
has done security work in Lexington
for Willow Springs Apartmens and
local hotels

There have been complaints from
campus” residents involving
strangers hanging around campus,

including a man seen on the trail bet-
ween Woods Creek Apart: cits and
the library two weeks ago.

“T was walking to class at about
10:45, I think it was a Monday, and
this man on the path said hell,’’ said
Julie Salerno, a resident of Woods
Creek Apartments. “Then after he
passed, he mumbled something
about me,”’ she said.

“T didn’t think much of it until my
roomate, Julie Snowdon, said she had
seen the same man on the path an
hour before I did, so obviously he
wasn’t just out for a walk. That's
when we decided to call security,”’
Salerno said.

Murph said he found the man two
days later near the back of the
library and told him he shouldn’t be
there and asked him to leave.

Salerno said she had another pro-
blem two Sunday nights ago when
she ran into a stranger near the front
library entrance who said he wanted
to show her something. She said she
quickly left.

According to Murph, the man later
approached Rob Powley near the
library and showed him a knife.

Powley called W&L Security, who
called the Lexington Police. The man
was arrested and charged with
public drunkenness and carrying a
concealed weapon

Despite occasional security pro
blems, most girls say they feel safe

on campus.

When asked how safe she thinks
things are on campus, Margaret
Pimblett responded by saying
“very.”

Patsy Sciutto said she feels very
safe, ‘‘except for late at night.”

“T feel safe on campus, but walking
around Lexington at night is kind of
scary,’’ said Caroline Carter

Maggie Allison said the only thing
that scares her around the dorms are
the tractors. Unfortunately W&L sec
nrity responds only to unlocked
doors, fire alarms and unwanted
strangers
OPINION
Improvement

With the fraternity renaissance program, Washington and
Lee is beginning to bring the fraternity system to a level of
excellence equal to its size. The Fraternity House Renovation
Program, which was presented at last weekend’s House Cor-
poration Conference, would result in fraternity houses that
reflect the quality of the university.

For a fraternity system the size of W&L’s, it’s amazing that
the fraternity houses in general are in such bad condition.
The problem is not that students do not want to live in the

 

. houses. The problem is the inside, and often outside, of the

fraternities is an eyesore.

For a university with buildings that are registered as na-
tional historic landmarks, one would expect that all buildings
connected with the university would fit the scheme of things.
Of course not all of the academic buildings are structures of
pure beauty, but at least the university maintains them and
keeps them in the best possible condition.

The proposal made at last weekend’s conference could
result in a dramatic renovation of most of the fraternities at
W&L. Everyone involved in this proposal needs to make all
the effort required to ensure that the renovation eventually
takes place.

The building of a separate basement party room in each
house is an idea whose time has really come at W&L. Not on-
ly will it make parties easier for the fraternities to control, it
will make it easier for the fraternities to actually have par-
ties. Lessening the risk of noise violations and such would
allow the fraternities to do more of what they want in the way
of partying.

It seems obvious that this program would be beneficial to
all involved. Therefore, the fraternities and the administra-
tion must work together to make it a reality. It would be a
shame for the program to collapse because of lack of par-
ticipation on anyone’s part.

immature

Washington and Lee is a place that purports to represent
the best of the college gentlemen and women. Students show
this to the world through our honor code, polite conduct to
visitors and the friendly atmosphere on campus.

If this is the case, why are the elevator doors in the Univer-
sity Library covered with grafitti? Just a quick glance at the
doors tells the reader how some fraternities feel about each
other or what some students think of certain individuals. The
doors seem to function like a newspaper along the lines of
The Weekly World News or National Enquirer.

It is a sad comment on the entire university when a few
people are apparantly compelled to comment on current
events (or dredge up old ones, as the case may be) on the in-
side of an elevator door. Think of any prospective student
who comes to visit W&L. He or she has been told the wonders
of the honor system, and how this campus is a perfect exam-
ple of how such a system should work. Should they believe all
they have been told when they read in the elevator that some
people who were found innocent are ‘‘guilty”’ or a ‘‘b....’’?

Those people who think it necessary to deface university
property to let their opinion be known need to learn what
courage is. Courage is not putting anonymous comments
around campus. If you do not believe in your opinion enough
to put your name on it, then your opinion is worth nothing.

There are ways to voice discontent at W&L. Talk to a
member of the administration who deals with the problem in
question. Write a letter to The Ring-tum Phi, or write a My
View column. In any case, let the community know who is
voicing the opinion. Otherwise, no one can take it for more
than what it is: juvenile scribbling by cowardly students.

Policy

All editorials which appear in The Ring-tum Phi are the
opinion of the newspaper, excepting those which are im-
mediately followed by initials of one of the members of the
editorial board. In that case the editorial is the opinion of the
member whose initials are listed. The members of the board
are Marie Dunne (MED), David Emrich (JDE) and Sean
Bugg (WSB).

All My View and other columns that appear in the Phi are
the opinion of the authors, and do not necessarily represent
the view of the newspaper or its editorial staff.

‘Apathy’ works well
with water polo team — Snozkin

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

One part of the Ring-tum Phi that I
have found particularly interesting is
the “Talkback” because reading the
opinions of fellow students and facul-
ty m@mbers is usually entertaining.
Unfortunately, I have to admit I was
a little perplexed by one of the topics,
‘What do you think about Athletic
Apathy?’’ The word apathy just
seemed to abstract; my high school
newspaper tended to use words like
good, bad, hot, and cold. Overwhelm-
ed with curiosity I decided to for-
mulate my own definition by watch-
ing the crowd during a weekend
water polo tournament. My reasons
for choosing Polo were simple: I play
on the team and, more importantly, I
spend enough time on the bench to
accurately assess the crowd. We
played well enough to advance to the
finals on Sunday, beating four teams
including top ranked University of
Richmond. Our opponent turned out
to be a skilled team from Arkansas
comprised mainly of foreign
recruits.

From my bench seat the stands
seemed to be mostly full. Arkansas
got off to a seven-point lead early in
the first period. We were having a lit-
tle trouble adjusting to their style but
managed to cut the lead to five by the
end of the first half. The crowd seem-
ed to have grown a little bigger and
by the start of the 2nd half, no one left
despite the fact that we were behind.

I wondered if this was ‘‘Athletic
Apathy,”’ but decided to reserve
judgment till later. We started the
second half with two quick goals that
brought us within three and activated
the crowd; which grew louder on
every counter attack. The W&L
players answered the cheers with in-
tense, inspiration play and the crowd
got even noisier. We scored again.
The crowd was now ina wild frenzy. I
would have trouble describing the
fans at this point, but they certainly
didn’t didn’t look apathetic.
Adrenalin permeated the air as
Arkansas pulled ahead and we slowly
fought back with the help of the
crowd. Finally we came within one
point on a spectacujar goal which
erupted the crowd into patriotic
chaos. I observed loyal faculty
members standing with the rest of
the students screaming at the top of
their lungs. The players could barely
hear the referees whistle. The ten-
sion was overwhelming. I still didn’t
now what athletic apathy was but I
knew it wasn’t this. The game
went down to the last second without
a lull in the excitment, with W&L
barely losing a hard-fought battle. It
was the most exciting athletic event I
ever watched and judging by the ap-
plause of the crowd at the end of the
game, I think they agreed. Coach
Remillard and every player ap-
preciates this loyal support. Please
come out November 1 for a potential
rematch with Arkansas in the
Southern League Championships. It
will be the last home tournament of
the season and your ‘‘apathy”’ would
really help.

Robertson’s marriage raises

doubts about

MY VIEW
By George W. Gist

 

On October 1, 1987, Television
Evanglist Pat Robertson ('50) of-
ficially declared his candidacy for
the 1988 GOP presidential nomina-
tion.

Last Wednesday, a story appeared
in the Washington Post revealing
that Robertson was legally married
on August 27, 1954, contrary to infor-
mation he had published earlier.
Robertson’s official resume and
biography are misleading in that
they indicate that he and his wife
were married on March 22, 1954. The
issue here is not deception, but
rather, conception. Robertson’s first
son was born ten weeks after the cou-

leadership

ple was actually married.

In a speech Robertson gave upon
announcing his candidacy, he said,
“We must...bring back the old-
fashioned concept of moral restraint
and abstinence before marriage.”
When questioned about this passage,
the Post article reported, ‘‘He said he
feels strongly that young people
should not repeat his conduct.”

My question is this: if elected,
would Robertson lead the country on
the policy of ‘do as I say, not as I do?’
Leadership, in any capacity, is most
effective when the one in command
leads by example. Furthermore,
Robertson is advocating a double
standard by this statement.

The American public, it is said, is
looking for new leadership. If Pat
Robertson thinks that leadership
founded on these perverse principles
is the kind Americans are in pursuit
of, he might as well go stand in the
corner with Mr. Hart and Mr. Biden.

Correction

There was a printing error in last week’s ‘‘Hazing”’
editorial. The first paragraph should have read: ‘‘At a recent
Interfraternity Council meeting it was said that any house
found guilty of hazing would immediately be removed from
the Washington and Lee campus. However, that statement
was later qualified to include only acts of hazing that are
deemed serious. But what about acts of hazing that do not
result in severe physical injury? Are they any less a violation
of the law?”’

SAB posts $10,000 loss;
No beer was sold at event

 

By George Sparacio
Staff Reporter

 

Although advanced tickets sold out
for last Friday night’s Fixx concert,
the Student Activities Board of-
Washington and Lee University lost
close to $10,000 on the event, accor-
ding to SAB treasurer Chris Moore.

Moore said that in addition to the
500 advanced ticket sales, approx-
imately 400 tickets were sold at the
door, bringing the total sales to about
$7,200. Despite this, SAB president
Sean Coyle said, “The concert was
successful compared to last year’s
Homecoming concert. We sold two
times the amount of tickets.”’

The SAB paid about $17,500 for the
concert. They spent $11,500 for the
Fixx, $500 for Dreams So Real, the
opening band, $3,500 for the sound
and lights, $1,500 for promotion and
$500 for the contract rider and minor
construction needs, according to
Moore.

Moore said that the 1987-88 budget
of the SAB is $30,000. There are usual-
ly three or four concerts each year,
at Homecoming, Christmas, Fancy
Dress and in the spring. The SAB
plans on using $10,000 for each event.
However, this year they plan to cut
out the spring concert due to the
Mock Convention and the fact that
they lost about $7,000 on the
Guadalcanal Diary concert last spr-

ing.

No beer was sold at last weekend’s
concert, but non-alcoholic beverages
were available at no charge. When
asked whether the SAB lost money
which would have been made on beer
sales, Moore said, ‘In the past, beer
brought in only about $500.”’ Coyle
said, ‘I’m sure it kept some of the
people from coming, mostly
seniors.”

Coyle said the SAB hopes to have
beer at the Christmas concert, ‘‘but
first we have to go through the ABC
and then the administration.”’ He did
express however that the ABC would
make it difficult. He said, “I will
definitely try’”’ to be able to have beer
at the Christmas concert.

Career office sponsors new series

 

By Christie Champlin
Staff Reporter

 

The Career Development and
Placement Office, under the direc-
tion of Richard Heatley, has designed
a four part series to aid seniors in
preparing their resumes and learn-
ing interview skills.

The series, which includes two
training and two practical sessions in
each area, “‘proves to be a very
beneficial approach,” according to
Heatley. On Monday, seniors par-
ticipated in an_ interviewing
workshop and on Tuesday they at-
tended a resume training workshop.
These were followed by an all-day
resume training workshop. These
were followed by an all-day resume
critique session on Wednesday and a
Mock Video session with a represen-
tative of the Hecht’s organization,
which is a part of the May Company,
on Thursday.

Seniors could come by any time on
Wednesday to have Heatley, Dean
Anne Schroer, or Penny Henneman
critique rough drafts of their
resumes. The students had ‘‘to have
done their preliminary work before
participating,’ said Heatley. ‘‘The
brunt of the duty” falls on Hen-
neman, added Heatley, since he must
take care of his administrative
responsibilities and Schroer is only
available on a limited basis.

Computers

By Abb Jones

The W&L microcomputer system
underwent a face lift over the sum-
mer.

Beginning in July, IBM’s latest
computer sytem, System Two, was
sent up throughout the university.
The new system, which was announc-
ed by IBM last April, involves a
switch from 5.25 inch disks to 3.5-inch
disks. According to Ruth Floyd,
Coordinator of Academic Computing
Applications, the change to small
disks on the microcomputers will
have many benefits.

“Three years from now it will be
the only type of microcomputer you
can get,”’ she said.

Floyd said the change to the small
disk was made primarily because of
its greater durability, and its ability
to store more intormation wan ine

skill when working with students in
an instructive way and, when need-
ed, in a corrective way,” said
Heatley of Henneman. The seniors
hear the ideals of a resume during
the workshop and usually have only a
“few miscellaneous little questions”’
during the critique sessions, said
Heatley.

Sometimes, said Heatley, the most
surprising fault with a resume is that
the student can not define his career
objective. This leads to career
counseling which consists of in-
vestigating the student’s major, see-
ing whether or not he enjoyed it,
determining the results of his career
testing, and discussing the possible
careers they can have as a gen-
eralist.

According to Heatley, there are on-
ly 20 major career areas; however,
there are 42,000 job titles.

If someone has less experience his
resume will be one page; however,
those with a greater amount of ex-
perience can expand the document to
two pages. Students can also have
more than one variation of a resume
to provide more definitions of the
career objective statement.

In the section describing work ex-
perience “if a student has two or
three types of work experience, sum-
mer or part-time, he should include
in careful, but reasonably full,
detail” his responsibilites using ac-
tion verbs, according to Heatley, ad-
ding that “‘if a student did not have

significant work experience the ac-
tivities section becomes more promi-
nent and may occur before work ex-
perience.”

The interests section ‘‘adds
humanity” to an interview because,
quite often, a recruiter will pull infor-
mation from the student’s interests,
said Heatley.

The office assists students in
“learning how to word’ their
statements. It is important not to
downplay activities and to learn
“sophisticated, professional’ ways
to state things, said Heatley. It is
necessary to find titles to respon-
sibilites and to use dynamic verbs to
describe these responsbilities to
“tactfully toot your own horn,” ac-
cording to Heatley.

The mock video sessions were
started last year by Schroer and con-
tinue this year through the CD&P Of-
fice and student recruiters. The first
fifteen minutes of each session is
devoted to filming the senior in an in-
terview situation with a recruiter and
the second fifteen minutes to a criti-
que of the tape.

Heatley believes that “‘it is very
important for students to catch the
series the office offers.’ There will
be another video session because of
the overflow of demand. The infor-
mation about it will be posted on the
bulletin board outside the CD&P of-
fice. There will also be another
resume workshop on December ist,
and a critique on December 3rd.

use new disks

“It is a much more durable
medium — the actual writing surface
of the disk is better protected,”’ she
said. “It’s also more dense. It stores
four times as much information.”

Floyd said the only difficulty that
arose from the modification was ar-
ranging for the information on 5.25-
inch disks to be stored on 3.5-inch
ones.

“We managed to provide some-
thing to bridge that gap,” she said,
although she added that equipment
available to make the micro-
computers compatible for 5.25-inch
disks and 3.5-inch disks was limited
due to a backorder.

In all, Floyd said 25 new microcom-
puters were installed over the sum-
mer, the majority of which went into
the Commerce school. Now that the
C-school has 29 microcomputers,
Floyd said classes held to teach
students, faculty and staff how to use

the computers have been expanded.

“With the C-school set up, this is
the first time we've been able to have
class of that size,’’ she said in
reference to the current computer
classes that have near full enroll-
ment.

Floyd said in the next year the
computer center would be attemp-
ting to implement what she referred
to as a Local Area Network in the
Commerce school.

The Local Area Network, which
currently exists in the Journalism
Department’s computer system,
allows students to submit files such
as papers and homework to pro-
fessors’ files through the computer
without having to turn in a print-out
of the paper. Floyd said this change
would greatly enhance the role of the
computers in the Commerce school.

The new 3.5-inch disks can be pur-
chased for $7 in the computer center.

and Lee and Rikkyo University officials.

W&L hosts domestic study...

By Laura Dodge
Staff Reporter

 

Four students from Japan are stu-
dying at W&L this year as part of the
East Asian Studies Program.

One of them comes from Rikkyo
University in Tokyo, and the other
three normally attend the Kansai
University of Foreign Studies in Kan-
sai Gaidai.

Another part of W&L’s broad East
Asian Studies Program involves an
exchange of two students with Chung
Chi College, the Chinese university of
Hong Kong.

W&L’s East Asian Exchange pro-
gram is an equal exchange for the
universities involved. Each students
pays tuition to their respective col-
leges for the year or semester, and
then just switches colleges. Air fare
is not included.

Each side must select a student
from a number of applications.
However, Professor Roger Jeans, a
member of the East Asian commit-
tee, thinks the foreign students from
Japan have more of a “fairly com-

petitive” application system since so
many want to study abroad.

Makiko Fuhui of Tokyo, nicknam-
ed Maki, chose W&L from a number
of U.S. colleges that offer exchange
programs with Japan. She said she
picked W&L because it “has a good
reputation” and she wanted to come
to the South for a ‘‘new experience.”

Having lived in Tokyo all her life,
then spending a month at the
American Language Program at Col-
umbia University, Fuhui said she
won’t miss the pollution or the traffic
of the cities, and she said she ‘‘loves
the countryside.”

In Tokyo Fuhui lives with her fami-
ly, which includes her parents, her
grandmother, a sister, and two cats
and a dog.

Her father, who has a librarian’s
degree from Louisiana State Univer-
sity, now works for an advertising
agency in Japan, dealing with many
Europeans and South East Asians.

Fuhui is also interested in
foreigners. She said, “‘If it’s possible
I'd like to work at a T.V. studio or a
travel agency.” Having already

received her qualification to teach
English, she is considering teaching
that or Japanese.

Fuhui said she already worked at a
T.V. studio in Japan. She finds that

.the students in Japan ‘‘work more on

their part-time jobs than school,” --
whereas in the U.S., students concen- *
trate more on academics. .

Fuhui thinks “people here work
much harder. It depends on the
students, but in general...”

Comparing Rikkyo to W&L, Fuhui
said they both deal primarily in
liberal arts. As far as her own
courses are concerned, she has a full
load,

“I find it difficult to take notes,
especially in American History. My
reading is so slow and the reading is
so much that it is very difficult.”

Fuhui likes W&L. ‘‘The people here
are so friendly. I think it’s a great
traditional custom to say ‘Hi’ when
you pass people in the street.”

As far as social life is concerned,
she seems to be doing well. During
this interview, she was asked for a
date to Homecoming.

...And also offers foriegn study

 

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

For students of good academic
standing who long to experience the
lifestyle and educational oppor-
tunities of a different country, W&L
offers a variety of foreign study pro-
grams.

W&L offers both six-week Spring
Term and academic-year programs
for study abroad. Other options are
sponsored by the Seven College Ex-
change Program, including schools
such as Sweet Briar, Hollins, Hamp-
den-Sydney and VMI.

A student does not have to be tak-
ing a language to participate in
foreign exchange studies. The
Drama, Biology, Art, Religion and
English departments offer Spring
Term programs in London, the
Galapagos Islands, Athens, Japan,
and at Oxford University in England.

European language students can
study French in Paris, Spanish in
Madrid, and German in Bayreuth.
Each of these programs lasts six
weeks during Spring Term, East
Asian and Chinese and Japanese
studies are offered on a semester-

long or year-long basis in Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Hirakata City and

‘As long as (the student is) going
to participate ina W&L program, you
have to be a good student in good
standing,” stated Dr. S.J. Williams,
who supervises study abroad in most
of the language departments.

He said that programs under the
other schools require a 2.5 GPA of
students that wanted to join.

Expense for going abroad must be
paid in addition to regular tuition;
financial aid, although somewhat
limited, is available to help cover the
costs. Students earn six credits
through the Spring Term programs.

Most programs require the student
to write a term paper or to do a pro-
ject of some kind as part of their
work done abroad.

Some programs involve a lot more,
however. Dr. Albert Gordon took
seven drama students abroad last
spring to study the acting techniques
and theatre practice of England. He
said that four times a week the
students ‘‘saw live plays...listened to
talks (given) by people in the
theatre, producers...then they wrote
papers about what they saw.”

 

The group spent four weeks in Lon-
don, then toured outside the city,
spending four or five daysin Paris. .

While these students enjoyed the
luxury of ‘‘bed-and-breakfast’’
hotels, those in other programs under
Spain and France stayed with
families in Paris and Madrid.

Senior Spanish student Ted Hart
talked about the differences in
lifestyle that he observed during his
eight-week stay in Spain (spending
two additional weeks traveling after
the original six-week term was over).

“Their whole outlook on life is com-
pletely different,” he commented.
“They're not as competitive with
other countries, not so pressured to
{out-] achieve other nations,
although they do compete among
themselves.”’

Sophomore Ashley Tredick added,
“It (study abroad) is a good program
if you want to learn the language and
experience the culture.”’ Tredick also
spent her Spring Term in Spain.

Students who would like more in-
formation on foreign study should at-
tend the information session spon-
sored by the foreign study committee
on Tuesday, Oct. 20 at 7:00 p.m. in the
Student Center, Room 114.

Crew club experiences revival |

The W&L crew club is making a
comeback.

The club ended in the 1970's. Last
year Tim Vesper, who is now in law
school in Tennessee, restarted the
club by purchasing an ergometer (a
rowing machine) with money given
tohim by the E.C.

This year Brandon Canaday, Debi
Hurtt, Mare Mulligan and Steve
Muller are trying to continue the
development of the club.

Members of the crew club are still
working out on the ergometer, which
is located behind the Lee House. The
club has eight oars on order and has a
good lead on two four-man shells.

This is a good start for such a
young club since the boats are expen-
sive and hard to find.

The earliest the club could get the
boats would be in the late Fall. The
club could get on-water experience at

Superdance ’88 kicks off with FD raffle

 

By Brook Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

Planning for the 10th Annual
Superdance has already kicked into
action.

Raffle tickets to win a Fancy Dress
Dream Weekend were sold at the
Fixx concert homecoming weekend,
and on Tuesday, October 13, commit-
tee members stormed Sweetbriar to
conduct informative hall meetings.

The Fancy Dress raffle is a fun-
draiser that offers two nights at the
Lexington Holiday Inn, dinner for
two at Maple Hall, Fancy Dress
tickets, T-shirts, cups and posters
compliments of the SAB, brunch at
the Palms on Sunday, March 6, anda

$15 gift certificate for lunch at
Willson-Walker as its prizes.

One ticket costs $2 and five cost $3.
Sales of the tickets ‘‘are going as well
as can be expected,” according to
Superdance co-chair Greg Knapp.

“The problem right now is that not
too many people are thinking of Fan-
cy Dress right now. It’s a good deal
with over $270 worth in prizes,’’ he
said.

The drawing will be held February
6.

More hall meetings are planned at
the Virginia Military Institute, the
other women’s colleges, and on the
W&L campus. Superdance commit-
tee members will provide pamphlets
about the 15 hour dance marathon as
well as encourage people to par-
ticipate.

Part of what the members will be
explaining are the new pledge rules
this year. Knapp explained that ‘“‘last
year we lost money when we billed
people. They’d look at a bill for only a
dollar and say, ‘it’s just a dollar.’”’

Because of the large failure to pay
small sum pledge bills, only about
$8,000 was actually collected out of
$12,000 pledged. In order to avoid this
money loss, the committee is requir-
ing that all pledges under $5 be paid
by cash or check.

Also, the $100 initial fee per dancer
must be paid in cash.

Each dancer is asked to collect at
least $100 either through a flat fee or
a certain amount per hour ‘‘with the
stipulation,’’ Knapp stressed, ‘‘that
each person should be dancing the
whole 15 hours.”’

He said “‘last year we had a lot of
people just lounging around. I think
it’s because alot of [fraternity]
pledges didn’t want to dance but
were required to dance. This year
rather than have 15 pledges stand
around... we’re asking the frats for
their support.”

Instead of requiring the frats to
make their pledges dance, the com-
mittee wants the fraternities to get
each of their pledges to raise 100
dollars and then sponsor a couple.

Since this is the 10th Annual Super-
dance, the co-chairmen Mike Herrin,
Chuck Husting, and Knapp, along
with their 10 year faculty advisor
Fontaine Bostic, are hoping for a big
success.

Their monetary goal is $30,000, the

same as last year. Although last
year’s pledges, at $33,000, exceeded
that goal, the actual amount col-
lected was $29,000. After expenses
are deducted, all of the money will go
directly to the Muscular Distrophy
Association office in Roanoke.

Last year’s Superdance band was
the White Animals. “This year,”
Knapp said, We're looking for
another medium-sized band, which
will hopefully be better than what
you see in the Pit.’’ Also, they plan to
have a smaller student band enter-
tain the dancers in the afternoon.

Some of the reasons students join-
ed the Superdance committee are:

Carol Howson — ‘I competed in an
event like this back home for Special
Olympics. It was a gymnastics-a-
thon.”’

Ted Schieke — “‘I am trying to get
involved in more school activities,
and the last 2 years have been alot of
fun.”

Brad Slappey — ‘‘“My mom would
be proud of me if she knew.”

duPont displays watercolor collection

 

By George G. Sparacio
Staff Reporter

 

A collection of watercolor pain-
tings by Basil E. Martin is on display
this month in the duPont Gallery of
Washington and Lee University.

Martin, born in Chelsford, England
in 1903, studied at the Chelsea In-
stitute and the Central Art Institute
in London before moving to the
United States in 1924.

The artist’s paintings have been
exhibited with the American Water-
color Society, the American Federa-
tion of Arts, the Golden Gate Exposi-
tion in San Francisco, the British
Empire Exposition at Wembley,
England, and the High Museum in
Atlanta.

He also had an number of one-man
shows in the U.S. His most successful
was back in 1948 at the Van Diemen
Galleries in New York City.

Most of Martin’s works are land-
scapes from Pennsylvania and
Maine. They include close-ups of
autumn foliage, colorfully shaded
snow scenes and numerous varia-
tions of the forests and woodlands
surrounding him.

The November 1948 issue of ‘‘Art
News’’ said about his Van Diemen
exhibit, ‘Martin uses watercolor
without tricks or ostentation, but
with a brilliance and clarity that
belongs to very few members of the
American Watercolor Society.”’

The Nov. 12, 1948 issue of the ‘‘New
York Sun’”’ said, ‘Martin is a realist

worthwhile undertaking”’ at the two-
day Fraternity House Corporation
Conference held last weekend.

During the Saturday session,
Oakland spoke on the ‘‘Methodology
of Renovation Planning”’ and pointed
out some of the facts unique to
Washington and Lee’s fraternity
system.

“There are three different types of
buildings being used as fraternity
houses at Washington and Lee,”
Oakland said.

“Old fraternity houses, relatively
new fraternity houses, and buildings
such as mansions and schoolhouses
which have been converted into
fraternity houses will all present dif-
ferent challenges.”

“After VMDP Architects, Inc. has
done the cost estimating,” said Lewis
G. John, Dean of Students, ‘“‘those
figures will be submitted to a financ-
ing committee to determine the most
suitable method of funding the reno-
vations.

“Our aim is to have the estimates
available for discussion by the May
Board of Trustees meeting.”

Both “favorable interest loans’’
and fund raising drives were men-
tioned in the conference as possible
financing plans.

The Fraternity House Corporation
Conference also reviews the new
guidelines and responsibilities of the
fraternities stated in a six part hand-
out, ‘“‘Standards for Fraternities.”

“All of the responsibilities and re-
quirements are to be meet by the fall
of 1988, said Leroy C. “Buddy”’
Atkins, associated dean of Students.

Dean John said, “The student
awareness and active participation
in the program will definitely have a
positive influence in its success.”’

Trident elects freshmen representatives

“There is a lot more to co-
education than the classroom,”’ said
Cary Baber, newly elected freshman
-epresentative to Trident.

Tuesday night, Trident held elec-
ions for two positions open to
reshman women. Five women ran
or the positions.

Laura Dodge joins Baber as a
epresentative. Both of the women
aid they wanted to get involved in
he organization to help open up more
ocial events and political positions
or women.

“Trident is a place women are
automatically involved and a voice is
heard. It is a creative outlet for
women without being a hindrance to
any other male activity,’’ said Baber.

Both women feel that through Tri-
dent activities, the group will be
more visible and will unite the
women at Washington and Lee.

‘Being a woman at this school is a
big challenge,”’ said Dodge. She said
the male students have the frater-
nities for an outlet, but it is much
tougher on the women.

Social activities through Trident
are planned for not only the women
at W&L, but also any other students
who want to participate. The cocktail

Harriers sneak
past Catholic U.

The Ring-tum Phi, October 15, 1987

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

It was close. Maybe too close for
comfort, but the Washington and Lee
men’s cross country team edged out
a 27-28 win over Catholic University
last Saturday on the General’s home
course.

Leading the way for W&L was
senior co-captain Scott Rippeon, who
finished second overall with a time of
28:12 over the eight-kilometer
course. The individual race for first
was also close as Rippeon lost by only
two records to Catholic’s Tom Caf-
frey. Following close behind for the
Generals (3-2) was senior Bill Clark
(3rd, 28:20). Freshman Larry Pilkey
(5th, 29:07), senior co-captain Rick
Norris (8th, 30:36) and freshman
Kennon Walthal (9th, 31:52) were the
other scorers for W&L.

‘We ran quite well as a team,”
said head coach Dick Miller. ‘‘We’re
spread out a long ways this year.
We're not very close together as you
can see by our times.’

The Generals competed without
the services of senior Richard Moore,
who missed the meet because of
medical school exams. Miller,
however, said this was not the reason
for the distance between the No. 1
and No. 5 runners.

‘*We’ve lost two men from last year
who we really haven’t replaced,”’ he
said. ‘‘We just haven't got that quali-

Junior Keith Boyd makes an apparent touchdown catch in the
endzone against Maryville. Boyd was ruled out of bounds on the

play.

ty of runner right now who can run
that close together.’’

What the Generals haven’t had
recently is pleasant weather in which
to race. This was not the case last
Saturday as sunny skies and warm
temperatures were the rule, not the
exception.

‘Tt was a beautiful day,’’ said
Miller. ‘‘You couldn’t ask for
anything better.’

Miller also commented on the pro-
gress of the Generals’ workouts and
training methods. W&L has been
tapering for its meets by having a
light practice on one day of the week.

“I feel, that during the week, we
need at least one rest day,’ said
Miller. ‘‘We’ve never done much the
day before a meet. It’s just a fun day;
a loosening up day.”’

On Saturday, the Generals travel
to Eastern Mennonite to run against
Goshen College, Bridgewater and E-
M in a quadrangular meet.
Bridgewater and E-M are two
schools that are members of the Old
dominion Athletic Conference.

“There will be a number of teams
there which will give us more of a
challenge than just a dual meet,”
said Miller. “I don’t look at our
regular season matches as far as an
indication of what can happen, say,
at the ODAC [championships]. This
is one Saturday; that’s another
Saturday, and once in a while so-
meone has a bad day.”

Women runners

take fifth

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Cross country invitational meets
are a lot of fun. You get anywhere
from 50 to 100 runners in the field
and, when the gun sounds, it’s every
person for himself. It seems like you
are always passing people or getting
passed yourself, so the competition is
fierce.

That sense of competition is what
the Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team was looking for
when it competed in the Division II
and III State Meet in Newport News,
Va. last Saturday.

‘‘We thought it was a good meet for
us,”’ said head coach Jim Phemister.
“It accomplished what we wanted to,
which was to get everybody out there
running faster than they had before.”’

“In a developing program, [an in-
vitational] is sometimes the only
chance you get to run against other
people.”

The Generals were without their
No. lL runner, freshman Paige Cason,
who was out with a foot injury, but
the team got some fine performances
from some of the younger members
of the squad. Junior Anne Geary was
W&L’s first finisher with a time of
22:11 for the five-kilometer course.
Freshmen Heather Jenkins and Pat
Lopez, with times of 22:42 and 23:45
respectively, were the No. 2 and No. 3
scorers for the Generals. Phemister

Football blows lead to Maryville in

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The Maryville Scots scored 21
points in the fourth quarter Saturday
to overcome a 17-3 deficit and spoil
Washington and Lee’s Homecoming
game, 24-19.

“In the first half, we were sort of
stumbling around in our own tracks
offensively,’ said head coach Gary
Fallon. “And, in the second half,
things just didn’t fall our way.

The Scots received the kickoff to
open the game, but the W&L defense
forced a Maryville punt after just
three plays. The Generals turned the
ball over less than two minutes-ater,
and the Scots drove to the W&L 30,
where a 47-yard field goal attempt by
Maryville kicker Henry Marambio
sailed just wide. .

After a W&L punt and a Maryville
fumble, the Generals drove 54 yards
to the Scot 15, where freshman
Carter Quayle split the uprights to
put W&L on the scoreboard, 3-0, with
4:43 left in the first quarter.

The two teams exchanged punts for
the rest of the first period and most of
the second. But W&L closed out the
first half with a 70-yard drive, capped
by a one-yard scoring pass to senior
tailback Chris Coffland from
sophomore quarterback Phil Samp-
son.

The Generals received the kickoff
to open the second half, hoping to ex-
tend their ten-point lead, but were

forced to punt three plays later. The
Scots took possession at their own 44
and drove to the W&L 10, where
Marambio nailed a 25-yard field goal
to cut the lead to seven with 9:17 re-
maining in the period.

Nine minutes later, W&L’s Samp-
son hit senior tight end Gar Prebor
over the middle from three yards out.
Quayle’s extra point gave the
Generals a 14-point lead with three
seconds gone in the fourth quarter.

The Scots suddenly decided they
would not accept their fourth loss in
as many games and put together a 73-
yard drive, ending on a 35-yard scor-
ing pass from senior quarterback
Mike Human to senior split end Bill
Delaney. Marambio’s kick with2:31
left in the game pulled the Scots
within seven.

After a W&L punt, the Scots put on
another excellent drive, capped by a
nine-yard carry by sophomore Mike
Randow with 6:25 left. Marambio’s
extra point attempt was good, and
the score was tied for the first time
since the game began.

W&L freshman Car! Gilbert fielded
the kickoff but turned the ball over on
his fourth fumble of the day, and
Maryville senior Jason Harbinson
recovered. The Scots quickly took ad-
vantage of the turnover, scoring in
only five plays on a two-yard run by
freshman Scott Roberts. Marambio’s
kick gave the Scots the lead, 24-17,
with 3:54 remaining, a lead they
would never relinquish.

The Generals drove to their own 47,

but the drive ended when W&L failed
to convert on fourth down. But a
Maryville fumble two plays later
gave the Generals a second chance
with 1:58 remaining.

Imitating his performance against
Randolph-Macon, Sampson put to-
gether a 55-yard drive in five plays
and 42 seconds, inluding a near TD
pass to junior split end Keith Boyd
that the officials ruled incomplete.

W&L’s hopes for a miracle ap-
parently came to an end when a
Sampson pass was intercepted in the
end zone by sophomore Randy
Turner. The Scots needed to run off
1:16 to lock up their first win of the
season.

The Scots fell on the ball on the first
three downs, but the Generals were
able to use their last timeout to bring
up fourth down with 28 seconds left.
Human gave up a safety by running
out the back of the end zone, cutting
the Maryville lead to five, and the
Generals got another chance when
the Scots kicked off with 22 seconds
left.

W&L fielded the kick with a fair
catch, giving Sampson and Co. yet
another opportunity to pull off the
win. The Generals drove 33 yards in
five plays, including a pass from
Sampson to senior All-America
tackle John Packett.

“T just reached out and caught it,”’
said Packett. ‘‘I could smell the goal
line, but I knew the officials wouldn’t
let me get away with it.”

The pass was indeed called back,

place

noted Lopez and freshman Margaret
Boyd (5th for W&L) as having par-
ticulary good days.

“We had two first-years who
scored for the first time,’”’ he said.
“We are real happy to see that
development out of them.”’

Out of seven teams, the Generals
finished fifth overall in the team
results but the two schools W&L
defeated were not able to field full
teams.

At this point in the season,
Phemister is pleased with the team’s
progress. Workouts are becoming
more familiar and routine and the
Generals have increased the distance
in their weekly mileage.

“‘We’ve built their overall mileage
up to 35 miles per week,’ said
Phemister. ‘Their longest run is a
ten-mile run and we have a mix of
speed and hill workouts as well.’’

According to Phemister, Cason
should be back within a week. Cason
is having problems with her feet and
her shoes. Phemister said it is not a
muscle strain but just a swelling that
is keeping Cason sidelined.

On Saturday, the Generals will
finally get an opportunity to run on
their home course as they play host
to a meet that will include runners
from all the other Old Dominion
Athletic Conference schools.

4th quarter

and the clock ran out on the next
play, giving the Scots a 24-19 victory
in their second Old Dominion Athletic
Conference game of the season. The
Generals are now 1-2 in the ODAC.

W&L will travel to Hampden-
Sydney Saturday to take on one of
their toughest opponents of the
season.

The Tigers, picked to win the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference in pre-
season rankings, own a 3-2 record,
but are undefeated in their two con-
ference contests. H-S beat Bridge-
water easily, 35-18, and edged Emory
and Henry last weekend, 14-13.

“When they faced Emory and
Henry,” said Fallon, ‘‘we knew it
was going to be a real dog fight.’’ The
Tigers pulled out the win when Jim-
my Hondroulis kicked his 49th-
consecutive conversion attempt with
3:07 left in the game. H-S’s defense
held Wasp quarterback Gary Collier
to nine of 18 passing for only 74 yards
and pulled down an interception at
the H-S one-yard line.

The Tigers were led by senior
fullback David Kelly (5-10, 185), who
carried 25 times for 139 yards and one
touchdown. ‘‘One of the finest run-
ning backs in the league,” said
Fallon.

Defensively, Fallon said the Tigers
aren’t very large, but they are very
balanced, quick and aggressive.
‘We're going to have our hands fill-
ed, there’s no question about it.””

Earlier loss avenged, but H,O polo fades in SE Varsity Invitational

By Hunter Catlett
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team is not sure how it should
feel after avenging an early season
loss only to lose the final two games
of the weekend.

The 20th-ranked Generals (16-4)
started the weekend off on a good
note by beating the 16th-ranked
Bucknell Bisons 12-11 in double over-
time. The win evened the season
series between the two teams--
Bucknell won 12-10 in Providence,
R.I., way back on September 20.

Against the Bisons, the Generals

jumped to a 1-0 lead on a goal by
junior co-captain David Reavy.
Bucknell’s Robert Dickens struck
back with two goals near the end of
the first period to give the Bisons a
2-1 lead.

Junior Andrew Morgan of W&L
tied the score at 2-2 nearly two
minutes into the period. Bucknell ex-
ploded back with four goals, two by
Dickens, to take a 6-2 lead. Junior co-
captain David Dietz scored with 46
seconds left in the period, and W&L
trailed 6-3 at the half.

Defense controlled the beginning of
the third period, as neither team was
able to score until junior Moose Herr-

It was an unfortunate coincidence

* that the last two opponents of the
« Washington and Lee women’s soccer

team were scheduled close together.

* Saturday’s game against Randolph-
_ Macon/Ashland resulted in a 5-0 loss,

and the score was 7-1 against

* Roanoke, another defeat, on Tues-

day. Surprisingly, it is the R-M
match that disappointed the players

week, so the General’s conference
record now stands at 3-1.

W&L had a disappointing Home-
coming on Smith Field last Saturday
as the team team was shut out 3-0 by
Messiah. Things just didn’t get roll-
ing early enough and, as a result, the
team moral dropped off enabling the
opponent to sneak off with the win.

Yesterday, W&L took a road trip to
Lynchburg only t return with another
mark to place in the loss col-
umn. Once again, the team got down
early and was unable to make the big
comeback. The Generals were at a
2-0 deficit when senior Chuck Lyle

the most, and the loss to Roanoke
would have probably been taken
more in stride if it weren’t for the
somewhat disheartening  oc-
currences of two straight negative
outcomes for W&L.

The Homecoming atmosphere on
Saturday was expected to tilt
chances of victory in the Generals’
favor. However, the players —. in-
cluding the captains — and head
coach Janine Hathorn reiterated the
fact that the activities on the side-
lines were serious distractions. W&L

ing’s shot found the goal with 2:05
gone, pulling the Generals to within
two. The Bisons quickly scored to
take a 7-4 lead with over four minutes
to play in the period. Junior Martin
Burlingame and Morgan then scored
consecutive goals for the Generals to
make it 7-6. The Generals kept the
clamps on Dickens and the rest of the
Bisons until Bucknell scored with 13
seconds left to make it 8-6 after three
periods of play.

The fourth period started slowly
and ended with a flurry. Dietz scored
a goal with 5:40 remaining to make it
8-7. There was a lull in the scoring un-
til, with 2:21 left in the game, senior

Simon Perez struck paydirt to tie the
score at eight. Twenty-one seconds
later, Bucknell’s Dickens broke free
for his final of a game high five goals,
and the Bisons led 9-8 with two
minutes to play.

With thirty seconds left in the
game, Reavy scored to tie the score
at 9 and send the contest into over-
time.

WA&L drew first blood in overtime,
as Dietz scored just nine seconds into
the period, giving the Generals a 10-9
lead. Bucknell again came back,
scoring two goals in 45 seconds to
take an 11-10 lead.

Once again Reavy

saved the

a row; end win streak at 3

found the back of the net and placed
W&L on the board. It was, unfor-
tunately, the General’s only direct hit
of the game.

Junior co-captain Johnny Sarber
commented on the team’s inability to
get on top of things early. ‘“‘We got
down 2-0 really early, as usual,”’ he
said, ‘‘but we showed a lot of com-
posure and came back and scored a
goal.”’

With the exception of an early lack
of intensity, W&L did play a solid
game.

“We played well in the second half
of the game,” said Sarber. ‘‘Their

had already lost to R-M and were ex-
pecting another challenge, yet the
General’s were optimistic about
avenging the previous defeat. Ob-
viously, concentration is a key ele-
ment in any competition, and W&L
needs that edge against a formidable
opponent such as R-M.

“We all thought we could have
done better,’’ said Mattson.
“Although we knew the team, we
played worse in this second game.

The Roanoke game on Tuesday

last two goals were made at the very
end of the game, and so the score
(5-1) was really no indication of the
game.”

The Generals still remain on top of
things in the ODAC, but they will face
a very tough squad in Gettysburg
College this Saturday at Gettysburg.
With six games left on the schedule,
W&L has plenty of time to get back to
the 500 mark. The General’s next
home game will be on Tuesday
against the Keydets of Virginia
Military Institute. W&L’s goal in this
game is to send the Keydets away on
“the walk of shame.”’

‘Women are still searching for first victory of Season

caused mixed reactions. Of course,
the final score was not wholly en-
couraging, but the team was satisfied
with its performance.

Sophomore Sarah Allen, from her
position as stopper which is not near
the front line — drove the ball in.

The Generals are

turning their attention towards
Thursday's home match with rival
Hollins, which looks promising, and
could help negate some disappoint
ment concerning the last two games

Generals, scoring with 57 seconds left
to tie it at 11 after the first three-
minute session.

During the second overtime,
neither of the exhausted teams could
crack the others defense until
Reavy—there’s that name again—
scored with 12 seconds remaining to
give W&L a hard-fought 12-11 vic-
tory.

The Bucknell game might well
have been a costly victory for W&L

Words in Edgewise

THE Boss has mid-life crisis

By Marshall Boswell
Staff Reporter

 

My goodness, what has happened
to poor Bruce Springsteen?

It’s not just that his new record is
unspeakably awful (which it is).
Plenty of important pop artists have
hatched raw eggs at the height of
their careers (anybody remember
Prince’s Around the World in a Day?
Thought not). Springsteen is a
special case — a man with all the
talent and integrity anybody could
ask for, coupled with an adoring au-
dience, glowing press, and the
easiest act to maintain in popular
music. I mean, the man made an
outrageous fortune being a good guy.
So where did it all go so terribly
wrong?

Before The River — his double
album epic that signalled the beginn-
ing of the end — Bruce Springsteen
made four records worth of some of
the most emotionally powerful
popular music committed to vinyl.
He started off as a prodiguously
talented heir to the throne of Bob
Dylan and Van Morrison, penning in-
tricate soul-and folk-influenced songs
that surged with startling lyrical
detail and clever wordplay. Then, in
no time, he channeled all of this
talent into a singular imaginative
worldview that used as its poignant
metaphores, the amusement parks
and boardwalks of the New Jersey
coast. And the music! Epic and an-
thematic were the only words to
describe it: the rolling piano work,

Pianist Rop

By George Sparacio
Staff Reporter

 

English pianist Sophie Roper-
Curzon performed for a large crowd
in Lee Chapel on Tuesday night play-
ing a variety of pieces from several
different eras.

Roper-Curzon, 19, began her pro-
gram with an Italian Concerto by
Bach. She played each of the three
movements gracefully and for the
most part accurately. She continued
with Schubert’s Impromptu in G flat
major which she played with intense
feeling. George Ray, an English pro-
fessor at Washington and Lee, said
that she seemed the most at home
with this piece. She concluded the

the doo-wop saxophones, tine tirst in
the air slogans of youthful idealism.

Sprinsteen’s following was so mili-
tant that to say anything derogatory
about the man in New Jersey was
certain to result in a severed head or,
at the very least, a broken wind-
shield. But all the hoopla, for once,
was almost warranted. The man was
a true hero: he spoke to these people
with such accuracy, such conviction,
that it was never a question of his
selling out. Oh no, he was born to run.
He was pulling outta here to win.

Then something strange happened.
The media, smelling a happening in
the works, caught on. And they told
everyone that he was the real thing,
that he meant every word, that he’d
never let you down. Finally a rock
star you could believe in. The man
woke up one day and found that he
was the Boss — an embarrasingly
wealthy one, at that. He was, in the
end, just a pop star — a commodity
for the record company to market,
the sales pitch being, “‘He’s a true
rock and roller who is really one of
us.’’ And somewhere, in order to
maintain his “‘integrity’’ (the way
Motley Crue maintains its
“rebelliousness’’ or Madonna main-
tains her “‘slutishness’’), Springsteen
altered his act: He became the voice
of the working class.

How ironic. As soon as the man
becomes an Industry, he all at once
begins articulating the desires of its
employees.

But some of us weren’t fooled. For
one thing, his music deteriorated
drastically. It was all three chord
“rock and roll,” designed to appeal
to his new mass audience. And the

er-Curzon

first half of her program with
Beethoven’s Sonata in C major, Opus
2 No. 3. She attacked the piece. It
seemed as though her hands were
made for the piano.

She started the second half of her
program with Bartok’s Six dances in
Bulgarian Rhythm. Professor
Timothy Gaylard of the Washington
and Lee music department said that
she showed ‘‘a definitude for the
music.’’ She continued with
Rachmaninoff’s Prelude in B minor,
Opus 32 No. 10. The program conclud-
ed with Chopin’s Andante Spianato
and Grande Polonaise Brillante,
Opus 22. Gaylard said that this piece
was ‘“‘most pianistically difficult.”
He continued by saying, ‘‘For some-

lyrical detail that made him so
special gave way to inarticulate
platitudes, lifted not from the mouths
of the people toward whom the songs
were directed, but rather second-
hand from ‘‘authentic’’ artists like
Flannery O’Connor, Woody Gutherie,
and Raymond Carver. He set out to
become an icon, but he’s inadvertent-
ly become a pathetic joke.

First came The River, a two record
set that Rolling Stone hailed as Bruce
Springsteen’s Grapes of Wrath. One
song, “Drive All Night,’’ was eight
minutes long, consisted of three
chords, and offered this as sign of the
narrator’s conviction: ‘Baby, I'd
drive all night/Just to buy you some
shoes.” The line ‘‘darkness on the
edge of town’’ appeared three times
on the record and was, not in-
significantly, the title of his previous
record. At least half the songs were
about cars, two had the word ‘‘heart”’
in their title, and nearly every one of
them was, in one way or another, sex-
ist.

Nebraska, a solo record where
Bruce made his Folk Statement,
followed, with the Boss singing
sparse acoustic tales of unemploy-
ment and unfulfilled dreams. The
record went platinum. And _ then
there was Born in the U.S.A., featur-
ing the new muscle-bound Bruce
displaying his backside on the album
cover, along with an American flag
— all just in time for the 1984 elec-
tions. Sure, the title track was really
about angry Vietnam Vets (a subject
Bruce should know all about: he lied
on his medical record in order to
avoid the 60’s draft). Was it his fault
if everybody took it as a patriotic an-

returns to

one her age, she did remarkably
well.”

Roper-Curzon made her debut in
the United States in the fall of 1985 at
Washington and Lee. Chris Deighan,
a 1987 graduate of Washington and
Lee said, ‘I saw her two years ago
when she was here, and her style has
really matured.”’

Junior music major Kevin
Struthers said, “I was awe-struck.
She’s just incredible. The scary part
is, what will she be like in five or ten
years.”

Freshman John McManus said,
“Asan art and rock fan, I even en-
joyedit.”

In 1985, Roper-Curzon was the win-
ner of the British Piano Maker’s

them? He’s just a rock star.

And finally, there was Bruce Spr-
ingsteen and the E Street Band Live, a
five-record in concert albatross that
is currently collecting dust in record
stores all over the world. Wait
another couple of months and you
might be able to buy it for about ten
bucks.

Now we arrive at Bruce Springs-
teen, the 1987 model. On the cover of
his new album, Tunnel Of Love, he
looks like a matinee idol (although
there is still an attempt at ‘‘authen-
ticity’ by having him pose in overalls
on the lyric sheet). The subject of the
new album is love — he is an adoring
husband now — and the approach is
Sensitive, Singer-Songwriter of the
Proletariat. But his vocabulary has
dwindled to about fifty words. Here is
a typical line from the record: ‘‘Get
it straight mister/Hey buddy that
ain’t me.”’ His new slogans have all
the depth of a Hallmark card: ‘‘When
you’re alone you ain't nothing but
alone.”’ And the music is so tepid that
it threatens to sour right there on the
turntable. If Brian Eno had made
this record, he might have called it
Music for Dentist Offices. Bruce plays
everything on the disc but percus-
sion, so most of the arrangements
consist of either a solo acoustic
guitar or a preprogrammed syn-
thesizer track. The E Street Band, I
suppose, was too busy dealing with
the stock holders. And there on the
liner notes is this telling dedication:
“Thanks to... everyone at Columbia
Records and CBS Records Interna-
tional for their freindship and com-
mitment over the years.”

I guess he really is the Boss.

In talking with Roper-Curzon dur-

she said that her life at home is nor-

Well, let me start with a few com-
ments about this article. Firstly, I
hope this will be the first in a series of
articles that will aid you, the con-
sumer, in searching for what might
be your favorite restaurant in Lex-
ington and vicinity. Secondly, this
column, and all others like it, will not
always be right simply because all
tastes differ, and that like test driv-
ing a car other than one made in Ger-
many, the critic may taste a
“‘lemon.”’

This morning I ventured to the Old
Main Street Sandwich Shoppe for
what I hoped to be a great lunch. I
had heard many good things from
various people and maybe, no, pro-
bably expected a little to much. But
with this in mind, and some reflec-
tion I offer you this critique.

I started this morning’s meal with
one of my all-time favorites: the
chicken salad sandwich on rye with
lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise.

Now, several of you may be saying to

, yourselves ‘‘How can chicken salad
be exciting.’’ And to be honest, now,
so am I. I think my mother, who
doesn’t cook (she uses one of those
things we have come accustomed to
in Stop-In on Wednesday night),
could possibly produce something a
little more exciting. But one should
remember that chicken salad is
chicken salad-it is basic, and this
sandwich shop certainly has wide-
range basics including vegetarian
concoctions.

What was exciting was one of the
Old Main Sandwich Shoppe’s special-
ty subs, the Polish Ham Sub: Ham
piled on a sub roll with imported
Polish Tilsit Cheese, lettuce, tomato,
onions, and a super delectable mild
horseradish sauce. What a change
from Humdrum ham 'n cheese.
There are others including an in-
teresting Taco Sub and the Grand
Marnier. If the quality and
deliciousness of the Polish Ham Sub
carries over to the others, they can
only be YUM!!

Britain’s Smiths say
their final goodbye

 

By Greg Ossi
Music Critic

 

With the breakup of The Smiths
last month, their latest effort,
“Strangeways, Here We Come’’ will
probably be their last as a complete
group. If you haven’t heard, guitarist
Johnny Marr called it quits and Mor-
rissey went on to his solo projects,
leaving the Smiths without their an-
choring members.

The album suffers no let down
because of this. It is well mixed and

diversified. When compared to their
past productions this album com-
pares favorably or better. Morrissey
is still telling morbid and depressing
stories and the melodies are still
ringing in your head long after you
have listened to them.

Strangeways begins on an upbeat
note with the song “A Rush and A
Push And The Land Is Ours.”’ The
song itself starts out with Morrissey
playing a catchy rhythm on the
piano. They reiterate their favorite
theme in ‘‘Death Of a Disco Dancer.”
“Girlfriend In a Coma’’ the first
single released earlier this summer
is another catchy tune with an in-

credibly morbid tale.
On the B-side Morrissey tackles his

self-proclaimed celibacy in ‘Last
Night I Dreamt That Somebody Lov-
ed Me.’ Beginning the song
with an eerie piano solo mixed with
the noise of a screaming crowd in the
background. Following is one of the
most unusual birthday songs ever
recorded, entitled “Unhappy Birth-
day.”’

In “Paint A Vulgar Picture,”’ one
of the album’s strongest tracks is a
sarcastic ode to the exploitation of
dead stars by money-grubbing
record companies. The record ends
with the mellow ‘‘I Won't Share You”
another Smiths tune backed by
Marr’s acoustic guitar playing and
Morrissey’s melodic sing-song voice.

The album is the tightest ever
released by the Smiths. It is definite-
ly their smoothest recording job.
Some will cry that they have sold out
by adding the various strings to some
of the tracks making them almost
Beatleseque. I argue that this is not
the case, the strings only added to
the strength of the album which is
made up of meaningful lyrics and
driving yet harmonious tunes.

If you like the Smiths you will love
the album.

- Six freshman candidates campaign in run-off elections

 

By Abb Jones
‘Staff Reporter

“Although most of the candidates’

posters have come down and the
flyers have been thrown away, six of
the original 34 freshmen running for
office at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity have continued to campaign for
today’s run-off election.

Willard L. Dumas III and Walter
Scott narrowly edged out the other 13
candidates for the run-off for
Freshman Executive Committee

Representative. Dumas received 51
votes, just under 15 percent of the 352
votes cast, while Scott received 43
votes, just under 12 percent.

Dumas, a native of New Orleans,
La., and pledge at Sigma Chi frater-
nity, says he wants to do what he can
for the school.

“T believe in the honor system
here, and I really like W&L and I'd
like to do what I can for the school,”
he said.

Scott, a native of Memphis, Tenn.,
says his past experience with his high
school honor council has prepared

W&L student receives
an antigen overdose

 

By Sean Campbell

Staff Reporter

 

A W&L student accidently received
an overdose of his allergy antigen
medicine after both he and the
University Health Center nurse
misread the instructions provided by
the student’s allergist.

Scott Cornell, a sophomore
member of Sigma Nu social fraterni-
ty, began receiving medication for
allergies in June of this year. When
school started, he had the injection
administered by the University infir-
mary.

The mistake was made on Sept. 29
when Cornell was to begin receiving
his maintenance level injections.

“The treatment,’ Cornell explain-
ed, ‘“‘helps the body to gradually build
up a resistance to the allergies.”

He was being treated for allergies
to fall pollen, spring pollen and en-
vironmental mold.

Cornell said, “‘The injections start
highly diluted and gradually become
more concentrated until the body can
tolerate a level higher than in the ac-
tual environment. After reaching
that level the injections are con-
tinued for a maintenance period
which varies with each individual.”

The correct maintenance level
dosage for each of the three solutions
was .05 c.c. The actual amount in-
jected for each solution was .5 ¢.c.,

ten times the designated prescrip-
tion.

Cornell said, ‘‘The shot looked too
big. It was a little bit my fault.”

The head nurse, Josephine H. Mc-
Cown, R.N., and Cornell examined
the instructions form Dr. Dan §.
Sanders, III Cornell’s hometown
allergy physican.

“After the shot, my arm felt sore
and was swollen, but there were no
other immediate side reactions. I
took a nap after dinner and when a
fraternity brother woke me, I knew
something was wrong. I felt dizzy
and my face, throat and hands were
swolen.”’

Cornell was driven to the infirmary
and the nurse on duty gave him two
injections of adrenaline to counter
the reaction. He also was kept over-
night for observation.

University Physician, Dr. Robert
M. Pickral said, ‘The bottom line is
if another doctor gives medicine to a
patient then that patient is responsi-
ble for its administration. If that doc-
tor sends the medicine to another
doctor to admimster then the second
doctor becomes responsible.”

He said, ‘The infirmary is ad-
ministering these allergy shots as a
financial convenience to the
students. These students need to be
aware of the individual dosages.”

Cornell said, ‘It was stupid that I
didn’t say any thing, I just assumed
she knew what she was doing.”

him for this job.

“T have served for five years on my
high school honor council, and I en-
joyed the responsibility and dedica-
tion that the job required.”

Presidential candidates Tom
Spurgeon and Tom Hatcher received
a commanding majority of the votes
in their race, splitting 54 percent of
the vote. Spurgeon received 106
votes to Hatcher’s 85.

Spurgeon, a native of Muncie, Ind.,
was the only candidate of the six who
made the run-off that said the

allowed for each of the candidates to

“T felt that I could do a good job

Three Buena Vista men were ar-
rested early Sunday morning and
charged with malicious wounding
after an attack on a W&L junior at a
fraternity party.

Pietro M. Petino, Jr., a member of
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, receiv-
ed a black eye and an injured finger
after three men pulled knives on him
at a Chi Psi party.

Michael W. Camden, 29, Thomas B.

27, all of Buena Vista, were arraign-
ed in Lexington General District
Court Tuesday. Camden was also
charged with assault and battery of a
police officer. Their court date has
been set for Nov. 17.

Petino said he was helping Chi Psi
fraternity members in removing a
knife from one of the three men at the
house when the men allegedly
assaulted him on the front porch.

Chi Psi President Frank Rooney
said he had asked the men to leave
before the incident occurred, but the
three pulled knives on him. He said
he immediately called the police.

Mock Democratic Convention ’88 is expected to cost

 

By Peter Boatner
News Editor

 

The 1988 Mock Convention, W&L’s
traditional attempt to predict the
presidential candidate for the party
out of power, will cost an estimated
$136,000, according to MC treasurer
J.J. Buquet.

That number represents the total
estimated expenditures of the fifteen
sub-committees of the Convention’s
Steering Committee, which is coor-
dinating next March's big political
event.

Though much of that has already
been supplied, more than $76,000 will
have to be solicited from private
donations.

The biggest cost for the convention
will be the estimated $25,414 required
by the state delegations to conduct
their research and to represent
themselves at the convention.

All in all, more that 1300 delegates
will take part in the extensively plan-
ned exercise, in addition to numerous

visitors, returning alumni and
reporters from across the country.

Responsible for overseeing the
budget is Buquet, a senior from
Houma, La.

“We were very conservative in
estimating revenue, and very liberal
in estimating expense,’’ Buquet said
of the process.

“After combining the subcom-
mittee budgets, we sat down and re-
hashed them compared to 1984,” he
said. ‘‘We eliminated the overlaps,
and added a little or took away a lit-
tle.”

Total expenses in 1984 came to
$118,541, Buquet said. The 1984 Con-
vention even left about $2,000 to get
this year’s event under way.

The success of the convention
depends on the research done by the
state delegations. They are required
to contact the Democratic leadership
in their state, to poll voters and to
keep up on the local issues of con-
cern,

The costs incurred here include

What next-

That linescore appeared in the sports section of yesterday's USA To-
day. We wonder if it should have appeared in the editorial section instead.

Thanks to Mr. Robert K. Tompkins of Morgantown, W.Va., for bringing

degrees?

for letters and solicitations.

A not insignificant duty of each
delegation is to construct a float for
the big parade. This parade, a major
event in the city of Lexington, kicks
off the convention weekend and is a
source of intense rivalry between the
states for prizes.

The Parade Committee was al-
located $9,580 to make sure all goes
well on Friday afternoon. This
money will go to erecting stands, pro-
viding security, and hiring extra
entertainment.

The second biggest expense of the
convention will be the attracting of
prominent speakers to the event.
Over $19,000 will be spent attracting
preliminary and keynote speakers.
The Speakers Committee has
already brought candidate Jesse
Jackson to campus last spring, and
has attracted such luminaries as
Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and
Harry Truman to past conventions.

Another major expense, and one
considered vital by most of the par-
ticipants, is the production of Mock
Convention memorabilia such as

hats, T-shirts and buttons.

Its 13 accurate predictions in 18 at-
tempts since 1908 have earned the
Washington and Lee University
Mock Democratic Convention a
highly respected and well-known
reputation among the press.

Every four years the students of
Washington and Lee University hold
the Mock Convention to predict the
presidential and _ vice-presidential
nominees of the party out of the
White House.

maintain the equipment at the con-

stands, the decorations, the furniture
and equipment rentals including
walkie-talkies, and of course for

Other major costs include printing

Rooney said one of the men got cu!

W&L senior Kevin McNamara pulle«
the men apart, the three men fled,
Rooney said.

Petino said he and Rooney then ap-
proached the police car which hac
pulled up to the corner of Lee and
Nelson streets. Petino was at the
Stonewall Jackson Hospital to have
his injuries examined when the thre:
Buena Vista men entered the hos.
pital.

“I was already there when they
brought [Camden)} in,” said Petinc
“He was yelling obscenities at the of-
ficers and across the room at me.”

Petino and Rooney identified the
three assailants to Officer Mark
Ramos, who apprehended them.

After handcuffing the men, Ramos
was also allegedly assaulted by
Camden.

“Due to the nature of his injuries, |
cuffed him in front, rather than pu!
his hands behind his back,” said
Ramos. ‘‘{Camden] took both hands
and hit me across the head.”’

Camden was later taken to tl.

has, ‘‘...a reputation as one of the

is, “The most realistic...’’ And the
Richmond News Leader said it is,
“well publicized and nationally

Tim Bolling, media director for the
Mock Convention, said the Conven-
tion in 1984 received coverage on
CNN, NBC, the Associated Press,
United Press International, The New

York Times, USA Today, U.S. News
and World Report and other
newspapers and networks. Bolling
said he expects the same amount oi
press coverage for the 1988 Conven
tion, but is focusing on getting more
national coverage. Bolling plans to
attract more media coverage ly
scheduling a number of prestigious
speakers. Some speakers who have
made appearances at past Conven-
tions are Harry Truman, Richard
Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Bolling
also said the 1988 Mock Convention
wants to get a pictorial in Life

Food Co-op offers more than natural foods

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

 

 

The Rockbridge Food Co-op has
moved its old store on Randolph
Street to a larger location between
Sweet Things and Rockbridge Video
on Washington Street.

Manager Mirabai McLeod says the
larger store, which opens Nov. 9, will
allow the co-op to offer more types of
items to its customers, including
housewares, clothing and even
organic cosmetics.

The co-op is a non-profit group run
by its members. Members used to
pay an annual due, and in return got
a discount on anything they buy. In
order to raise the money needed to
move to the larger store, the mem-
bers decided to charge a one-time fee

of $96 dollars per adult for a lifetime
membership in the co-op. The fee,
which still entitles members to a dis
count, is refundable if a member
should move out of the area

Members can also work at the co
op to get an even larger discount

McLeod said all of the labor involved
in building shelves and the checkout
stand came from its members, with
the co-op providing the materials.

McLeod said using members as
employees works well.

“Tt really bothers me where I used
to work that there was one person
who never did any work, but made all
the money. We don’t have that
here,”’ she said.

The co-op used the $5,000 it raised
from its members to buy new com-
mercial refrigerators and freezers
for the 1200 square foot store, more
than twice the size of the previous
store. The co-op used residential
refrigerators at its Randolph Street
location.

The new store will also offer a
sandwich and juice bar. The bar will
be open for breakfast, offering
organic coffee, croissants, bagles,
and eggs. Lunch includes such items
as burritos, tofu hotdogs, and organic
hotdogs, as well as fresh juices and
sandwiches

Organically raised meat is a new
product to the co-op. Many members

are vegetarians, but McLeod said a
survey found a narrow majority did
want the co-op to carry meats. The
organic meat, meat from animals
who have not been treated with hor-
mones or steriods and have been
given feed that was not treated with
chemical fertilizers or insect killers,
is bought from local farms.

McLeod, who attended 4 national
expo on health food last weekend in
Philadelphia, said she and others are
amazed at how the industry has
grown from ‘‘a few hippies buying
brown rice’ to a_ million-dollar
business.

The latest trend in the industry is to
offer prepackaged fast food-type
health food. The co-op carries frozen
pies, pizzas, and taco dinners.

The food co-op buys mosts of its
grains and herbs in bulk and sells
them in smaller packages. Most
items bought at regular grocery
stores require ‘more money in
packaging than in the product,”’ says
McLeod.

Many new customers are surprised
at the higher costs of organic foods.

McLeod says she considers buying
the food as an investment in her
health. She and her family don’t
have to buy medicine or pay doctors’
bills, which makes up for the higher
cost of the food, she said.

The store carries everything to
cover family needs, includin;
natural toothpaste, dog food, sham
poo, and bug repellent. McLeod says
the only thing she buys at a regular
grocery store are toilet paper and
dish soap.

The Rockbridge Food Cooperativé
will hold a grand opening on Nov. 9
The store will be offering samples of
many of the items it carrys such as
different kinds of cheese and
crackers and soybean ice cream
McLeod encourages those who aren't
familiar with natural and organic

products to come in and look around

The co-op’s hours are from 10 a.m

to6 p.m. Monday through Friday anc
10 a.m, to 3 p.m. on Saturday. The
sandwich and juice bar, which is ex
pected to open in about a week, will
be open from 7:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m
Monday through Friday.
 

 

 

 

OPINION
Budgets

The Mock Democratic Convention is coming up this year,
and everyone is getting ready for the big event. The eyes of

 

: ,zthe country will be on W&L, so everything must go well to
---make that all important good impesssion.

The Mock Convention is valuable for W&L. Not only does it
generate interest in the university, it allows students to learn
what it takes to run an election, and makes them educated
voters when the actual election comes around. It also draws
the school together to work toward a large goal.

However, it is very unfortuante that the Executive Com-
mittee has decided that the Mock Convention is important
enough to take valuable budget money from other student
organizations. When organization’s budgets were announced,
the message was clear: everyone tighten your belts so Mock
Convention can roll through.

Here is an example of some of the resulting problems. The
'_ Ariel, The Political Review and The Journal of Science will
. all be forced to publish only one issue this year, if they rely

only on their budgets for money. All three of these publica-
tions requested $2,400 each. They each received only $1,200, a
reduction of 50 percent.

* These publications, along with other student groups that
experienced budget trims, were told to search out other
sources for funds. A great idea, if only a few groups were in-

volved. But sending out a pack of organizations to compete ©

against each other is not only unfair to the groups, but to the
alumni, parents and benefactors they will be contacting.

Although W&L benefits from generous gifts, the well of
“money is not bottomless. And with the individual states of the

.Mock Convention trying to raise money for their efforts, the
-- whole fund-raising scheme threatens to turn into a huge
fiasco.
°» Perhaps if someone on past Executive Committees had

planned ahead, this problem could have been avoided.
< Unfortunately, no one seemed to be thinking that money
could have been put aside in smaller percentages over four
years, instead of giving the Convention a huge lump sum and
killing the budgets of other organizations.
“: Also, the idea behind the budgeting is very weak in some
places. When an organization finishes the year in the black,
“the money they saved does not stay with that organization.
Instead, it goes back to a general fund to be redistributed the

“next year. This is surely one of the most ridiculous policies

‘around.

Why budget money to student organizations, then in effect
_Sive them the message to spend as much of it as they can? If
~sthe organizations were encouraged to save money and were
“allowed to keep what they saved, then that organization

would not need such a large budget. Basically, this would put
some stability into the system, which is sorely needed in
some organizations.

., The ones who get hurt the most by all this are the students.
‘They are unfairly being deprived of a full extra-curricular
“schedule, which is very important to one’s college ex-

‘perience. Although Mock Convention is important, not every

Student will want to participate. Does that mean that those

students should have activities they are interested in reduc-:
éd?

“ Everyone deserves a chance to use their talent. That is

What the organizations are for. It needs to be ensured that in

the future, everyone does have the chance to use their talents
with others who share the same interests, even if an election
year is coming up.

Urinalysis tests are unconstitutional

 

MY VIEW
By Kathy Morrison

 

'y younger brother, George, has a

t green T-shirt at home which
bears a decal that says “JUST SAY
NO”’ in six-inch white letters, I sup-
pose the faculty rationale-he did, by
the way, get the shirt at school--went
something like ‘“‘let’s spend this
much money to print up this many
shirts which might help these kids
resist drugs and other Nasty Peer
Pressures so they can stay out of jail
and someday be all-around respec-
table citizens like us.” (Well, I’m
sure it went more or less like that.)
But for some reason, that shirt
bothers me...maybe because it’s a
very tacky green, maybe because it
conjures visions from Orwell’s
**1984”’, or maybe because I can just
picture my skinny little brother being

_ cornered by a chain-bedecked gang

of dope fiends who wave large
reefers in his face as he slowly backs
away, mutely shaking his head and
pointing at the bold decal emblazon-
ed across his twelve-year-old chest.

Of course, George won't be twelve
for the rest of his life, and it’s most
likely that he won’t say no to every
forbidden fruit he stumbles across.
But by the time he gets old enough to
really appreciate the temptations of
dissolute living, what will be forbid-
den to him? Perhaps if the amount of
social change between now and five
or six years serves as any indication,
George as well as the rest of this
generation—our generation-may see
some radical change in the area of in-
dividual rights.

assured in the Bill of Rights that we
cannot be forced to testify against
ourselves: this is stated in the fifth
amendment. Thus, persons under ar-
rest must be informed of their ‘‘right
to remain silent’; citizens in court
may “plead the fifth’ in response to
an obviously self-incriminating ques-
tion or request. The fifth amendment
is a very important safeguard of in-
dividual rights-but under the Reagan
administration’s mandatory drug-
testing program, these rights are be-
ing sorely abused. i

By “mandatory drug testing,” I
refer to urine analysis, a test now be-
ing administered to government em-
ployees as well as to many em-
ployees of civilian corporations in the
United States. An interesting talk on
the ethics of such testing was given at
Washington and Lee last Thursday
by Rick Lippke, and many of the
following ideas as well as all stated
facts were originally brought forth in
his presentation:

Presumably, this test can identify
traces of cocaine or marijuana by
analysis of a urine sample. The test is
not, howover, one-hundred percent
accurate; for example, the chemical
IB Profin, found in Advil and some
other pain relievers, may _ test
positive for marijuana. Some care
may (or may not) be taken to help
enhance the accuracy of the results--
such as testing the temperature of
the sample or even supervising it’s
collection as a safeguard against
cheating the boss with borrowed
urine, or a presently available ‘‘just
add water” variety. The test is not
cheap either. A test administered
with any amount of care runs about
one hundred dollars a shot (so to
speak); in the first year of man-
datory drug testing, Reagan’s ad-
ministration spent over fifty millidh
dollars on the program. What’s
more, the government isn’t the only
organization utilizing this program;
Lippke mentioned that around thirty
percent of the corporations listed in
Fortune 500 have adopted a practice

of random drug testing. Random
testing operates in such a way that
anybody can be asked at any time to
submit a urine sample, regardless of
any cause for suspicion or lack
thereof.

This particular weapon of the so-
proclaimed ‘‘war on drugs’’ violates
the basic tenet of the fifth amend-
ment: in being asked to undergo such
testing, an individual is put into a

body to divulge information to an
that could not be dis-
covered in any other way under the
law. Thus the employee is forced to
incriminate himself if he does, in fact
use drugs, and is punished if he does

enough to ensure the guilt of the ac-
cused, making it possible to wrongly
condemn an innocent man.
Technology will, however, pro-
bably improve, possibly to the point
of 100% accuracy for these sorts of
tests. What then? If an employee
must work and live under the con-
stant threat of losing his job because
of a weekend toke, it’s most likely
that he won’t take chances. In this
way, drug testing does fulfill its aim
of preventing drug use; but it also in-
hibits that employee’s right to his
own private life, taking away his in-
dividual freedom to the point of the
unconstitutional. Why should anyone
care if Joe.the mailman gets a little
high on a Sunday afternoon? What’s
the moral difference between
high and getting drunk, legality of
substance aside? The point is, it’s
Joe’s business.
But then again, it’s not Joe's
business anymore if he gets a little
high before and during work, or if he
gets behind the wheel of a large
automobile. However, it’s a ridi-
culous waste of time, money and
energy to enforce any rule by means
of the constant threat of (perhaps er-
roneous) accusation and exposure,

LETTER

The W&L Women’s Soccer Team played a
home game against Hollins College last Thurs-
day afternoon on Smith Field. Many W&L
students turned out to watch the rivalry embar-
rassingly enough, however, a very vocal group of
these W&L students cheered for Hollins. I found
this behavior revolting.

I realize that many of the people sitting in that
section of the bleachers date Hollins students—I
am certainly not criticizing that (on the con-
trary, I would encourage it). But I wonder if a
W&L coed dating a Hampden-Sydney football
player would dare to root for the Squids... It’s
just unthinkable, isn’t it? Or how about a W&L
coed cheering for the VMI tennis team? She
would be ridiculed! !

I can understand that someone would want to
support his or her friends on another team. At
the same time, what happened to respect for
one’s peers, and perhaps more importantly, for
one’s school? At the very least, these people
could have remained neutral out of mere com-
mon courtesy. It was disappointing for me as a
spectator to watch W&L students rooting against

WLUR thanks sponsors

To the editor:

WLUR would like to publicly thank the Lex-

ington and Lee football broadcasts this year.
Through the generosity of Alvin-Dennis Clothing
and Herring Travel Services, we were able to br-
ing our listeners complete live coverage of the
Washington and Leé football games against
Randolph-Macon and Hampden-Sydney. Without
the assistance of these public-spirited mer-
chants, our coverage of Washington and Lee
football would be limited and incomplete.

Once again, thanks to Alvin-Dennis and Her-
ring Travel for their generous support of
Washington and Lee University and WLUR.

By Brad B. Root
Staff Reporter

 

With the 1988 Presidential Election
just around the corner, the College
Republicans will begin to solicit sup-
port for the Republican Party.

According to Greg Dale, chairman
of the College Republicans at
Washington & Lee, the purpose of the
to promote
Republican ideas on campus and get
members involved in campaigning
and establishing political platforms

This year more than 200 W&L
students expressed interest in the
College Republicans at the open
registration held during matricula-
tion. Dale noted there is a con-
siderable decrease in participation
this year compared to previous
years. Only an estimated 25 people
attended the first organizational
meeting several weeks ago. In the

members

past there have been as many as 400
members who were actively involved
in the organization.

In the next few weeks members of
the College Republicans will be
debating different issues in prepara-
tion for the Issue Conference held on
Nov. 21, at the College of Wil-
liam & Mary. Dale added, ‘We
are also going to try to do some
things with the Young Democrats
both here on campus and at other
Virginia schools.”

In February, the State Convention
will most likely be held in Roanoke.
Members of the W&L chapter may be
assiting in the organizational stages
of the program. At the convention,
delegates will be electing a chairman
for the state.

Any students still interested in join-
ing the College Republicans may at-
tend the next organizational meeting
yet tobe announced. At that meeting
a $5 dues assessment will be col-
lected.

Senior Mory Watkins will be start-
ing up a brand new organization
called the “General Volunteers’, a
volunteer social workers’ group, with
a meeting for all interested persons
tonight at 8 p.m. in the Fairfax
Lounge.

Watkins, a senior French major
from Maryland, became involved in:
social work in high school and

+ became interested in starting up a

social work group at Washington and
Lee when Marlys Craun, wife of Pro-
fessor Ed Craun of the English
Department, told him of three pro-
grams which needed volunteers.

Since then he has added two more
programs to the list and hopes that he
can get volunteers for each program.

The name of the program was
derived from the W&L mascot and
the fact that it is a diverse program.

Watkins got the go-ahead for the
organization from Dean Anne
Schroer, but has worked on it alone.
He said he has received offers from
others to help him, but he has insisted
that his project has to have some
structure before he can delegate any
responsibility.

His program is separate from
Alpha Phi Omega in that APO is a
service fraternity, and his program
's a social work program which in-
volves consistency,

What would you do if you were
President of the University for one
day? “I’d make all the faculty and
employees park in the Corral and let
the students park on the Hill,’’ said
junior Michael Forrester. “Do you
get paid? What about a free lunch?”
asked junior John Catron.

President of the University for a
day? The idea was conceived by
junior Sean Bugg and senior Jon
Solomon as a way to get students ac-
quainted with what the president
must deal with on a day-to-day basis.
President John Wilson was very en-
thusiastic about the concept. “I
thought it was a very novel idea,”’ he
said.

Various student comments follow-
ed the proposition of being president
for a day, but most students had to
give the idea much thought before
they could even provide an answer.
Junior Kelly Putney said she couldn’t

iA half-timehraffile jdtawing spon-
sored by Sigma Nu at the Parent’s
Weekend football game Oct. 31 will
determine who gets use of President
Wilson’s office on the following Mon-
day, Nov. 2. Tickets can be bought
for $2 each in the co-op starting
tomorrow until the following Friday.
All proceeds from the raffle will be
donated to the United Way.

While some lucky student is sitting
in President Wilson’s office, atten-
ding meetings and speaking with his
staff about current problems that
have arisen, President Wilson will be
sitting in that student’s classes tak-
ing notes. President Wilson said
“every 5 minutes something new
comes up,”’ so whoever is president
for the day will have to deal with
that. However, he added that the stu-
dent would not be able to change
University policies for the day.

What if the student encounters

what I see as the definition of social
work—consistent work with people.”’

The list of programs that will be
started consist of an Alternative
Education program, The Eagles Nest
Clubhouse Program, the Lincoln
House program, The Mayflower Nur-
sing Home Program, and an Out-
Patient Escort Service program.

The Alternative Education pro-
gram, located in the National Guard
Armory in town, is composed of
several students who have been
removed from high school and need
one-to-one tutors for their basic sub-
jects.

The Eagles Nest Clubhouse Pro-
gram, in downtown Buena Vista,
operates as a bridge for mentally ill
patients who are getting back into

society. The Lincoln House, located
between Lexington and Buena Vista,
is a program which involves interac-
tion with the mentally retarded.

The Mayflower Nursing Home Pro-
gram, operated through Stonewall
Jackson Hospital, consists of visiting
the elderly.

The Out-Patient Escort Service
program at the hospital helps out-
patients with their recoveries.

Volunteers will be able to choose
whatever program they wish to work
with. They will, however, be asked to
sign a contract because of the time
commitment.

“Social work involves a commit-
ment to have any long-term effects,”
said Watkins.

Catron. President Wilson com-
mented, ‘*Obviously, he
overestimates the power of the presi-
gent!

He also said that other volunteers
who cannot make the time commit-
ment will be welcomed.

He hopes to get some funding for
the organization, but included that
because it is still in its building
stages, there is some uncertainty as
to its needs.

He will fill whatever programs he
can, but said that one program get-
ting many more volunteers could
cause a problem because one group
would become stronger than the
others, and he wants to keep the
“General Volunteers” unified.

He estimated that in 3-4 weeks all
of the programs will be off the
ground.

“As soon as the links are establish-
ed, the programs will start.”’

He said he wants others to ex-
perience what a great thing social
work has been for him from every
angle, not to mention that it will pro-
vide future references.

“I’m so excited, it’s like starting a
revolution or something,’’ he said.

He wants the organization to carry
on year after year and continue to
grow so that it will include programs
other than the five he is beginning
with.

Job fair held for seniors

By Sean Campbell
Staff Reporter

 

CHALLENGE ’88, a career fair for
seniors sponsored by nine of the area
colleges and universities, currently
has 48 organizations scheduled to
provide information and conduct in-
terviews at the Radisson Hotel in
Lynchburg on Wednesday,
November 18th.

The majority of the organizations
are Virginia-based. However several
federal organizations such as the FBI
and the CIA are scheduled partici-
pants.

Washington and Lee University’s
Career Development and Placement
office promotes the program saying
it will provide students with an op-
portunity to talk with employers
representing a wide range of career
areas.

Employers from the banking,
finance, marketing, sales, retailing,
graphics and writing fields plan to
have tables of information about
their organization in a central area.

In addition, students submitting a
resume, with their registration may

have an opportunity to interview with
companies. A pre-selection proccess
will determine who is offered an in-
terview. The promotional flyer says
some companies also will holc
general information sessions from
6:30 to 9:30 p.m.

The participation in the fair is
limited to students from the nine
schools sponsoring the event
Hampden-Sydney College, Hollin:
College, Longwood College, Lyn
chburg College, Mary Baldwin Col
lege, Randolph-Macon Woman’s Co!
lege, Sweet Briar College, VMI, an
W&L.

Registration fees are $\ per stu
dent. Also, two copies of each par
ticipant’s resume are required fo
registration. These will be placed ii
resume books for employer refer
ence. Additional resumes for ever’
company a student would like to in
terview with must be turned in by Oc
tober 16, the registration deadline.

Students granted interviews wi
sign up either by 8:30 a.m. for th
morning session or 1:30 p.m. for th
afternoon session on November 18.

Commerce School purchases new microcomputers to aid students

 

From Staff Reports

 

If Congress cuts next year’s budget
by $60 billion, what will be the effect
on the national economy?

Nobody really knows the answer to
that question, but it’s a typical
forecasting problem that professors
might ask their students in a college
economics class.

Hours of research in the library
would enable the college student to
make some predictions, and, when
the next class meets, those predic-
tions could be discussed. But, at the
Commerce School students can work
on that problem as soon as it’s asked,
for all the students in the class are
sitting at their own IBM Personal
System/2 Model 50 computer.

In recent years, computers have
become an integral part of most
departments at W&L. But what
makes this lab unusual is that the 29
new microcomputers in the lab will
soon be hooked up into a common net-
work with all the other computers in
the building.

That network will be controlled by
file servers located in the adjoining
laboratory manager’s office.

This network will allow instructors
to work in their own offices, store in-

formation on the file servers, and
have students gain access to the data
in the microcomputer lab, thus utiliz-
ing the lab for individualized class in-
struction, we well as for classroom
assignments.

Programs that are already on the
computers are Word Perfect, Lotus,
and the Dow Jones Information
Retrieval system which connects to
an off-campus base. In addition,
some of the computers have access to
statistical programs on the universi-
ty’s prime computer.

Most students are already familiar
with the Word Perfect word process-
ing program. Lotus is a spreadsheet
program for accounting, and the Dow
Jones News Retrieval provides ac-
cess to a complete financial profile of
businesses.

An instructor’s work station at the
front of the room will enable pro-
fessors to control the 29 monitors in
the lab to transmit the contents of
their screens to those of his students.
The lab, also equipped with seven
printers, is accessible 24 hours a day
and is staffed until 11:30 p.m.

In a memo to W&L President John
D. Wilson last year, Larry C. Pep-
pers, dean of the School of Com
merce, Economics, and Politics
stated, “We face a major challenge

in fully integrating microcomputers
into the curriculum of the (Com
merce) School.”’

“This computer lab will allow
faculty members time to focus on the
challenging task of curriculum revi
sion as courses are overhauled to in-
corporate microcomputer
techology,’’ said Peppers.

An ad hoc microcomputer planning
committee comprised of Commerce
School faculty members submitted a
report outlining the hardware needed
for such a facility. The cost estimate
was $200,000. Contributions from
W&L alumni honoring senior pro-

fessors paid for the project
Earl Edwards, a 1969 W&L
graduate, is the lab’s full-time

manager. Among his many duties is
instructing students in microcom
puter mechanics (how to create files,
save data, etc).

A Lexington native, Edwards has
worked with computers since he
graduated from W&L. Most recently
he traveled across the country in-

stalling software for steel fabricators
for Structural Software Co. of
Roanoke

Of the new IBM Personal System /9
Model 50
“This is a new. generation of
machine. The operating system for

networking won’t even be ready until
next spring. That gives us almost a
year to get the faculty and students
used to the machines.”’

The new machines are faster, more
compact, and use 3 1/2 inch high den-
sity microdiskets, which hold four

times more information than floppy
disks. Each machine has a hard disk
that can store all the basic programs.
When the system is networked next
spring, common data bases can be in-
stalled and made available to
everyone in the building.

“The laboratory speaks to
critical need in the School of Cor
merce, Economics, and Politics
states Dean Peppers. With the ce
tral accessibility of so much inform
tion, there’s no doubt that it ‘mak
everyone much more productive.”’

LSAT is called ‘five hours of living hell’

 

By James Midkiff
Staff Reporter

 

“Five hours of living hell.’’ That is
how senior Tom O’Brien described
the Law School Admission Test.
Another senior, Bucky Strauch, was
a little more reserved. ‘‘It was not an
enjoyable experience.’

Greg Unger said, “When I walked
out of the test, my brain was intellec-
tual Jell-O.”

Every year, law school hopefuls
across the country subject
themselves to the intellectual trials
of the standardized test put out by the
Law School Admissions Service.
Last Saturday, 85 students took the
test when it was offered at W&L. Ac-
cording to Dr. Rick Heatley, director
of Career Services and Development,
that is almost twice as many as last
year.

Heatley said more people are tak-
‘ing the test across the nation; so
many that the company that provides
the test has been caught shorthand-
ed. Naturally, the number of people
taking the test has risen by 40 per-
cent.

Heatley thought that the sudden in-
crease of interest may be tied to the
depictions of lawyers in the popular
“L.A. Law’ television series or
because of interest in the Iran-Conra
investigations. The result of this
surge in interest may be that law
school admissions will be more com-
petitive this year, according to
Heatley.

Many law schools are already very
selective. The mean GPA for
students entering W&L Law School
last year was 3.2. These student’s
mean score on the 10- to 48- point
scale of the LSAT was 35.

Law professor Edward Henneman

said that an applicant’s GPA and
LSAT score are two of the most im-
portant factors considered by law
schools.

The LSAT does not test how much
an applicant knows, though. Instead,
the LSAT is designed to test how a
person thinks. According to Hen-
neman, the LSAT is supposed to be a
good predictor of first year perfor-
mance, but a high score does not
mean that a student will do well in
law school.

A low score could keep a student
out of law school altogether, though.

It is because the LSAT is so very
important to pre-law students that
several courses have sprung up
claiming to help prepare students for
the test. One such course was offered
at W&L.

Greg Unger, a senior that took the
LSAT Prep Course, expressed the
common belief that the course was
not worth the $295 cost.

Blood Drive falls short of goal; nets

 

By lan Thompson
Staff Reporter

 

The Blood Drive held in Doremus
Gym on October 7th failed to meet
their goal of 150 pints of blood,
although the American Red Cross did
accept 129 pints from donors of the
W&L Community.

Norma Hancock, a_ registered
nurse, described the W&L Blood
Drive as “‘successful’’ compared to
other small college campus blood
drives. The Red Cross has taken
other blood mobiles to Roanoke Col-
lege, Hampden-Sydney and Hollins
College among others.

The first donor came through the
door at 11:30 a.m., although most
donors came in the late afternoon
before 5:00. Hancock described this
period as “‘hectic since it takes 45
minutes per donor.”’

Each donor went through seven
stations. First the donor registered,
then moved to the medical history
and temperature check station.
Some questions included in the
medical history are ‘‘ever taken self-
injected drugs?’’ and ‘‘been to Haiti
or Zaire?”

Next a Women’s Auxiliary
volunteer questions the donor about
“tatoos, hepatitis and AIDS among
other things,” said Hancock.

The fourth station

is the

hemoglobin station where the donor
has his ear pricked to determine his
or her iron content in their blood.
The donor them picks up an empty
blood bottie and is escorted to a cot
where a nurse asks the donor more
questions. Hancock said “‘the nurses
repeat some of the important ques-
tions concerning AIDS”’

When asked whether ail the nurses
were registered, Hancock said that
some nurses were “‘licensed practi-
cianers who are qualified to let
blood”, although they were ‘‘not
R.N.’s”.

Blood-letting takes about five
minutes and is followed by a 15-
minute recovery, during which

“T could have learned the same
thing from buying the book and mak-
ing the effort myself,” Unger said.

Tom O’Brien took the Kaplan
course during the summer and
thought that it helped him on the test.

“‘T knew what type of test it would
be,”’ O’Brien said. ‘The course
taught you how to pace yourself.”’

“Tf it helps me get in law school, it
was worth it,”’ he said.

The Kaplan course cost nearly
$500.

Professor Henneman did not know
if such courses could actually help a
student raise his score. He did not
think that it could hurt, and it might
lend confidence.

The LSAT will be offered again on
Dec. 12. The deadline to register is
Nov. 12, but those wishing to take the
test should sign up as soon as possi-
ble, according to Dr. Heatley.

129 pints

donors were provided sandwiches
and sodas by the Newcomer’s Club.

What was the reaction to giving
blood? John Missert, senior and six-
time blood donation veteran said ‘‘it
didn’t hurt at all’. Missert donated
the much in demand blood type, O
positive.

Some donors pass out. ‘‘This is
rare,’ said Hancock, ‘“‘and these
donors are told not to give blood.”’

Student organizer, Chris Martin
said ‘It went pretty well considering
everyone was sick.’’ The IFC award-
ed prize money to the fraternities
with the highest participation. Phi
Delta Theta won $100, Pi Kappa
Alpha won second and $50, and Chi
Psi pooled $25 for finishing third.

An ‘unusual’ toy shop ignores electronics

 

Robert MacPherson
Staff Reporter

 

All over the United States, children
are amusing themselves with elec-
tronic gadgets that beep, blink and
the touch of a button, and it is safe to
assume that manufacturers and

store owners alike are following the
trend.

That is, store owners other than
Nancy Jarrell.

Despite the popularity of electronic
toys, Jarrell specializes in what she

calls “‘the different and the unusual”
in her store, Creative Dimensions.
Located at 117 W. Nelson St. in Lex-
ington, Creative Dimensions has
something for kids of all ages.

‘‘No one ever grows up,”’ said Jar-
rell, referring to the reason why her
store has survived for almost three
years. “I have as many older
customers as I do younger ones,”’ she
said,

Jarrell said that she is able to com-
pete with larger stores such as Roses
and Maxway because she carries
items that those stores do not.

“People still want old-fashioned
toys. I carry fun things that even
adults like,” Jarrell said.

Until last April, Creative Dimen-
sions was located in Lexington’s
Main Street Mall. Jarrell said that
the store on Nelson Street is about 300
square feet larger than the one on
Main Street. She said that the move
to the larger store has increased
business “‘a great deal.”

Items for sale at Creative Dimen-
sions include candles, greeting
cards, stuffed animals and games as
well as toys. According to Jarrell,

most student business comes from
sales of stuffed animals.

Jarrell said that she expects this
year’s holiday season to be a big one
for her store despite new toys which
she says are “‘nothing spectacular.”
She said that a current big-seller is a
stuffed version of the Anheiser-Busch

mascot Spuds MacKenzie.
Jarrell said that Creative Dimen-
sions offers a layaway plan qnd ac-

cepts majorcreditcards. ©

Store hours are 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Monday through Friday. Jarrell said
that hours will be extended during
the holiday season.

points, money substitutes which are
available to students and faculty at a
discount rate, were up to almost
$4,000.

Torrence said the rise in the drink-
ing age and stricter security on band
nights were two of the main reasons
for the decline in beer sales.

‘We all work for the university so
we can’t encourage students to
drink,”’ he said.

He added that because the GHQ is
affiliated with the university, it can-
not advertise off-campus.

“Since we are a non-profit opera-

tion, we can under-sell the area
restaurants,” Torrence explained.

According to Torrence, the main
objective of the GHQ is to “‘offer an
alternative to the snack bar and the
dining hall.”

“The GHQ is the only place on
campus where you can go to sit down
and be waited on,” he said.

Torrence said that in addition to
the traditional Wednesday night
bands, the GHQ will be sponsoring
bands on Friday nights. He said that
when the GHQ sponsors a band, the
only money it brings in is from beer
sales.

“The band plays for the door,
that’s the deal,”’ he said.

Torrence said that the odds are
about ‘‘50-50” that a Friday night
band will be good business.

The GHQ is open for lunch from
11:30 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. Monday
through Friday. Dinner hours are
from 5 p.m. until 7:30 p.m. Sunday

through Friday.

The GHQ is normally closed on
Saturdays but Torrence said it will be
open on Oct. 31 for Parent’s
Weekend.

How sweet it is.

The Washington and Lee women’s
cross country team won its first meet
of the season Saturday, defeating
Emory and Henry, 45-18, in Lex-
ington.

The Generals (1-2) had help from
two sources in gaining the victory:
the arrival of a new runner and the
advantage of running on their

 

challenging home course.

Freshman Paige Cason took se-
cond place overall for W&L, finishing
in a time of 24:01 over the 5-kilometer
course. Her time was good enough to
break the course record for W&L run-
ners and was the third time this
season that she was the General’s top
finisher. However, it was the perfor-
mance of the team’s second finisher,
freshman Shawn Wert, that gave
W&L an extra lift.

“I knew that Shawn would do well
when she got a chance to run with
us,”’ said head coach Jim Phemister,
“because she’s run with us some in

practice and she’s a very tough run-
ner. I was very pleased, but not sur-
prised.”’

Wert, running in her first meet
because of a commitment to fall ten-
nis, finished fifth overall with a time
of 26:29. Wert was the General’s No.
5 singles player on the women’s ten-
nis team before joining the cross
country team.

Juniors Stephanie Smith and Anne
Geary and freshman Margaret Boyd
were the other three scorers for
W&L.

Running on one’s home course can
give a decisive edge and, according

to Phemister, this was definitely the
case in this meet.

“Our course is a very hard one for
everybody,’”’ he said. “It’s also a
very slow one for everyone.
Everyone who ran on it ran probably
several minutes slower than they run
on other courses. The harder it is,
the more home court advantage that
gives you.”

Phemister also cited the impor-
tance of experience when racing on a
difficult course.

“Our two junior runners, Anne
Geary and Stephaie Smith, who are
both experienced on the course,

Women harriers win 1st meet of season on home course

seemed to respond well to it,’’ he
said.

The Generals will compete again in
Lexington on Saturday at 2 p.m. in
what Phemister calls a ‘jumbled’
meet. Runners from Southern
Seminary, Hollins, Sweet Briar,
Mary Baldwin and West Virginia
Tech willl possibly race, but
Phemister said he was not certain
whether any of the schools would
field a full team. The men’s cross
country team, which did not compete
last week, will go up against
Bridgewater and West Virginia Tech
at 2:30 p.m.

The second game of the tourna-

ment had W&L and the University of

‘ North Carolina-Wilmington squaring

off. The Generals jumped to a 5-1
halftime lead and, led by junior
*David Reavey’s four goals and junior
. David Dietz’s three goals, cruised to
a 13-4 victory.

In the semi-finals the Generals met
*George Washington University. The
first half was a defensive war that
saw the Generals claw their way toa
4-2 halftime lead.

“We started off slow.-The coach
‘said we needed-a big win, so we just
tightened the screws and became
more intense,’ said junior Martin
‘Burlingame, who led the Generals
-with four goals in the game.

Indeed they did. The offense open-
“ed up and the defense pitched a sec-
-ond half shutout as the Generals went
-on to win 12-2.

Sunday’s showdown with Arkansas
was a dandy. After an intense defen-
sive first quarter, the Generals led
2-1, the second period the
Generals took leads of 4-2 and 5-3
/before the Trojans bounced back wth
twe goals in the final 1:14 to tie the

From Staff Reports

After winning its very first game —
ever — Saturday against Sweet
Briar, the women’s soccer team
returned to Lexington to tie Lynch-
burg on Wednesday.

The Generals downed Sweet Briar
3-2 in overtime. Sophomore Satah
Allen booted in the game-winner
from 20 yards out with 3:40 left in the
first of two overtime periods.

The men’s soccer team fought two
very close battles this week and
came out on top in both. The wins
were not against Old Dominion
Athletic Conference foes, but the
Generals’ overall record buoyed
back up to sea level at 5-5.

The Generals made their first
strike of the week on Saturday at
Gettysburg. Senior captain John Coll
had two direct hits in the first half of
the game. W&L was denied any score
padding in the second half, but the
two-goal margin proved to be too
large for Gettysburg, which was only
able to score one goal in the second
half.

The VMI Keydets stormed Wilson
Field on Tuesday for the annual
cross-town rivalry between W&L and
VMI.

Charles Lyle was the General who
took advantage of a short-range shot
that put W&L on top, but that was
about all the action for the
scorekeeper as the Generals held on
for a 1-0 win on a dreary Lexington
fall afternoon.

“Their style is real physical and
aggressive,’’ said sophomore Rick
Silva.

Salzman and sophomore Mary Alice
McMorrow doubled the score.

On Wednesday, sophomore Joelle
Jackson kicked in a goal with six
minutes remaining in the second
overtime period to tie the Generals
with Lynchburg at 1-1. Ties stand
during the regular season.

W&L’s record is now 1-7-2, The
Generals will face Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College on Saturday at
11:30 a.m. on the New Alumni Field.

Football loses 3rd

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Teams that are highly touted in
pre-season polls often disappoint
their admirers once the real competi-
tion begins. But, as Washington and
Lee head football coach Gary Fallon
will quickly tell you, such is not the
case with the Hampden-Sydney
Tigers.

Living up to their reputation as
pre-season favorites to win the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pionship, the Tigers steamrolled the
Washington and Lee Generals on
Saturday, 35-7.

“They certainly didn’t disap-
point,’”’ said Fallon. “I think it was
their quickness that gave them the
added edge.”’

The opening drive was surprisingly
balanced. Hampden-Sydney threw
three times and gave the ball to the
tailback four times; in fact, head
coach Joe Bush all but ignored his
leading rusher, senior fullback David
Kelly. But the Tigers showed they
didn’t need the potential All-
American. Hampden-Sydney took
the lead it would never relinquish
less then six minutes into the game
on a 6-yard run by senior tailback
Kevin Wallace. Sophomore kicker
Jimmy Hondroulis extended his
perfect career in extra points to give
the Tigers a 7-0 advantage.

The W&L offense took the field for
only three plays, losing three yards
before junior Tom Skeen was called

 

on to punt. Two plays later, the W&L
offense took Kelly out of the
ballgame with a knee injury. When
Hampden-Sydney’s John Jewell
fumbled away the football on the
very next play, things were suddenly
looking up for W&L. But the Generals
managed only five yards in three
plays before Skeen returned to the
game once again.

This time, however, the Tiger of-
fense stalled at the Hampden-Sydney
21, and the Generals took over at
their own 32. But sophomore quarter-
back Phil Sampson threw an in-
terception on first down, and the
Tigers were soon back in the end
zone.

The subsequent W&L possession
was the closest thing to a drive the
Generals could manage in the first
half. Starting at his own 23, Sampson
completed four passes and carried
the ball twice before being sacked at
the Hampden-Sydney 42. A Sampson
pass was picked off by Tiger
freshman David Ingram on the very
next play, and the W&L offense left
the field empty-handed yet again.

The Generals received the kickoff
to open the second half, but picked up
right where they left off. After a first
down pass to senior tight end Gar
Prebor, Sampson was intercepted by
Tiger freshman Trip McLaughlin.

Turned away again, it was time for
the W&L defense to provide some
momentum. The Tigers drove to the
W&L 3, where the defense held on
fourth down. A clear swing in
momentum followed, and the
Generals drove 97 yards in only 11
plays, including five consecutive
completions by Sampson. The Gen-
erals scored on_ second-and-goal
when Sampson hit senior split end
John Roe in the end zone. Quayle’s
extra point made the score 21-7 with
12:51 left in the fourth quarter, and a
game that seemed all but over
moments earlier was suddenly that
much closer.

The victory was the third win in a
row for the Tigers, who are
undefeated in three ODAC games.
The Generals fell to 2-3 overall and
1-3 in the conference.

 

 

A hit!

Yankees’ owner
a real disgrace

The recent firing of Lou Pinella from the position of New York
Yankees manager is the last straw. George Steinbrenner is not only a
disgrace to the -game of baseball, he is also a big, fat, ugly jerk of a
human being.

Can Steinbrenner show any patience? How about compassion?
Maybe some understanding? Nah, all ol’ George is concerned about is
winning pennants and making bucks, which is ironic considering that
it is lack of concern for his players that is keeping him from claiming
the American League East title.

Come on, George! Relax. Take a chill pill, for Pete’s sake. You
have great players, used to have a great manager and Yankee
Stadium is one of the best fields around. So what’s the problem? I’ll
tell you. Steinbrenner has no brain!

Why fire Pinella when he is respected and admired by both his team-
mates and managers around the league? And his replacement? Billy
Martin? What’s this make it: the 100th time he’s managed the
ballclub? Gimme a break. It seems to me that George is bored with
trying to win championships (which would happen if he would just
keep his fat nose out of the dugout) and just wants to instigate
something in the newspapers. You know the old story. Everyone has
forgotten about the poor Yankees so George decides the best way to
make people notice again is to make a radical move or lambast some
player through the press.

Let’s take an example of the insaneness of it all. Don Mattingly,
New York’s gold-glove first baseman and a person most fans consider
God in spikes and batting gloves, is the player involved. Steinbrenner
wants the team to practice on Mondays, one of the few off days for
ballplayers. It’s a volunteer workout. George, however, has express-
ed his desire for everyone to attend. Mattingly is a no-show. No pro-
blem, right? You know, every superstar needs a day off every now
and then. But nooooooo00! George says Mattingly is a slacker, a guy
who is not willing to lay it on the line for his team. Who is he kidding?
To add insult to injury, the gutless Steinbrenner does it in the papers.
Why don’t you say it to his face, wimp?

Steinbrenner justifies all his actions by saying he is acting just like
any normal fan who wants his money’s worth. He reasons that he is
paying Dave Winfield $2 million a year for home runs and RBI and he
doesn’t get them on a consistent basis, someone is going to face the
consequences.

What Steinbrenner doesn’t realize is that he doesn’t own a team of
baseball machines. They are human beings. No one (especially you)
is perfect, George. Why don’t you get off théir backs? You haven't
won anything doing it your way, now have you? Why don’t you just
leave your players and manager alone? Take a trip to Russia in April
and don’t come back until October. I think it’s a pretty good idea.

As long as Steinbrenner is owner, I hope the Yankees don’t win
another game. Wouldn't you just love to see a 0-162 record for the 1988
season? I know I would. I wish no happiness for you Steinbrenner, you
rich, spoiled bum. You stink.

 

 

NOTES — Ah, the strike, she is over. Nice move on the players part.
They throw almost a quarter of their season’s salary in the garabage
and end up taking an action that they could have done in August,
before any of this happened. Final Score: Owners 72, Players 0 ...
Congratulations to the women’s soccer team for its first win of the
season and the program on Saturday ... The Twins will win the World
Series in six games. Bet the ranch and the dog on this one... Will the
NHL’s regular season ever mean anything? Will anything meaningful
be said by ALF, the dog from outerspace? I think not...

TheNam Triad is completed

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

On May 10, 1969, the 10ist Airborne
Division's B Company, and the 3rd
Battalion of the 187th Infantry storm-
ed up Ap Bia Mountain in the heart of
Vietnam’s A Shau Valley. Ten days
and 241 American fatalities later, the
North Vietnamese Army was gone
and Ap Bia Mountain was secured.
The American government called Ap
Bia a victory. The soldiers who
fought there called it ‘“‘Hamburger
Hill.”” In Vietnam, there were no vic-
tories, only victims.

Less than a year ago, Oliver
Stone’s Platoon examined the
morality of Vietnam, and for the first
time, presented on screen, the harsh
realities of the war that the
American public had chosen to ig-
nore or forget. Then in May, Stanley
Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket showed
us the psychological side of Vietnam,
the warping effects of which
thousands of American veterans are
forced to live every day. Now, John
Irvin's Hamburger Hill completes
the triad by bringing to the screen,
the blinding, maiming, killing side of
Vietnam; the violent side.

Platoon chronicles the develop-
ment of Chris (Charlie Sheen), a col-
lege dropout who volunteers for Viet-
nam to see the “glory of war.’ What
he finds instead, is a war of ethicsbet-
ween the sadistic sergeant Barnes
(Tom Berenger) and the humane
sergeant Elias (Willem DaFoe) that
ultimately leads to destruction and
death. Chris’ final soliloquy, given as
he is being pulled out of the war to
finally go home, sums up the haun-
ting message that Stone implies in
the film.

“TI think now, looking back, we did
not fight the enemy. We fought
ourselves. And the enemy was in us.
The war is over for me now; but it
will always be there, the rest of my
days. As I’m sure Elias will be;
fighting with Barnes for what Rhah
called: possession of my soul. There
are times since, I’ve felt like a child,
born of those two fathers. But be that
as it may, those of us who did make
it, have an obligation to build again.
To teach to others what we know, and
to try with what’s left of our lives, to
find a goodness and a meaning to this
life.”’

Vietnam was a chess match played
by an_ indecisive, uncommitted
American government that used the
youth of our country as pawns.
Thousands of American soldiers
were lost unnecessarilly, and for
what? For truth, justice, and the
American way? Fifty-eight thousand
of our veterans died in the Vietnam
War, yet today, communism is still a
way of life for the Vietnamese.

Haunting memories are a way of
life for many of the American
veterans who fought in Vietnam.
Thoughts and visions of the war are a
hell that only they can understand,
and one that follows them like the
death that shadowed them in the
southeast Asian jungles. These
psychological effects are the subject
of Stanley Kubrick’s Full Metal
Jacket.

If there is one word to describe
Kubrick’s films, the word is shock-
ing. Full Metal Jacket is no excep-
tion. Kubrick’s film, based on the
novel, The Short-Timers, is a
scrutinized study of the psycho-
logical side of the Vietnam War. The
first half of the film is spent in basic
training where the recruits are brain-
washed into becoming killing
machines.

“This is my rifle.

There are many like it, but this one
is mine.

My rifle is my best friend. It is my
life.

I must master it as I must master
my life.

Without me, my rifle is useless.”’

Following week after week of this
routine, and total physical, emo-
tional, and psychological humiliation
and degradation, the soldiers com-
plete their basic training and go
directly into Vietnam to prove
themselves. It is there in combat,
when the platoon is picked apart and
murdered by a mere child, that the
soldiers, most especially Joker (Mat-
thew Modine), begin to realize and
understand the futility of the
American occupation in Vietnam.

Joker’s realization is, on a personal
scale, what John Irvin examines on a
large scale in Hamburger Hill.
Though it is never mentioned in the
film the saddest aspect about the at-
tack and subsequent takeover of Ap
Bia Mountain was that within a
month of the seizure, the mountain
was abandoned by American forces

and retaken by the Vietnamese. "The
entire offensive on ‘Hamburger
Hill’ existed to repel the North Viet-
namese Army away from coastal
regions. There was never any inten-
tion to keep what we had taken, and
as a result, 241 American soldiers
died in vain.

John Irvin’s Hamburger Hill is a
powerful film that pulsates with
overwhelming violence. Irvin does
however take time to make a
political statement. The film has ex-
tremely heavy undertones of the
apathetic American attitudes that
many Vietnam protesters shared.

In one of the scenes, a reporter con-
fronts the commanding officer of the
platoon that just stormed the
hill, and says to him, ‘‘Word at
headquarters is that you can’t take
the hill. Senator Kennedy says you
don’t have a chance. What do you
think of that?” Sadly, this attitude is
the same lethargic, apathic attitude
that soldiers came home to after the
war. Men deserving a_ hero's
welcome received nothing but
animosity and contempt.

At one point in the film during a

discussion among the soldiers about |

their backgrounds, the doctor of the
platoon replies, ‘‘We are all no good
niggers on this hill, blood and soul.’’

discriminate.

Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and
Hamburger Hill are all excellent
films. Though they each give totally
different perspectives on the War,
together they form a triad that when
united, takes a giant step toward
understanding the hows, whats, and
whys of Vietnam. Oliver Stone,
Stanley Kubrick, and John Irvin have
stepped back and asked why. Their
answer is; that there is no answer.
The three films manifest themselves
in acts of violence, just like the war
itself.

Platoon ends with a shot of the war-
torn jungle that Charlie is being
taken out of. Full Metal Jacket ends
with an expanding shot of a bomb
crater where bodies covered in lime
are being bulldozed in for a mass
burial. Hamburger Hill ends with a
shot of the mountain, and the hun-
dreds of dead bodies that cover it.
Each film ends with a tragic state-
ment. Was it all really necessary?

Perhaps the best expression of the
intentions, and aspirations of the
directors in making these three
films, comes from a poem that closes
Hamburger Hill.

“If you are able, save for them a
place inside of you, and save one
backward glance when you are leav-
ing for the places they can no longer

go

them, though you may, or may not
have always. Take what they have
left, and what they have taught you
with their dying, and keep it with
your own. And in that time when men
decide and feel safe to call the war in-
sane, take one moment to embrace
those gentle heroes you left behind.”

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

Enrollment increased in 3 of 4 classes

 

By Christie Champlin
"Staff Reporter

This fall the enrollment at
‘Washington and Lee University has
‘reached 1,543 students, an 8 percent
increase over the enrollment in the
efall of 1986. An increase has been
shoticed i in all of the classes except the
sophomore class
+ The size of the freshman class
grew to 432 students, an increase of
*7.8 percent; the junior class grew to
,384 students, an increase of 20 per-
cent; and the senior class grew to 341
*students, an increase of 8.3 percent.
,Thesophomore class decreased 1.5
‘percent, to 386 students. The enroll-
*ment at W&L represents 46 states,
the District of Columbia, two U.S.
territories, and 14 other countries.
+ Frank Parsons, the Executive
Assistant to the President, attributes
"to increase to the fact that the
+Students are better prepared to han-
die the conditions they face.
*“Students are not leaving in
, the figures of the last decade,”’ said
Parsons.
+ The university planned for the

growth of the student body from 1,350
students to 1,500 students when the
choice to become a cooedducational
institution was made. The increase
was built to maintain male enroll-
ment of approximately 1,000 to con-
tinue the traditions in disciplines
such as athletics and to maintain
across the board the programs that
succeeded when W&L was all male,
according to Parsons. However, the
increase was planned as a more
gradual _ process, _ tentatively
reaching 1,500 around the year 1992,
he added.

“Part of the increase is planned.
The rest is bonus which came about
through the high retention rate,”
Parsons said. There are also transfer
students. The amount of transfer
students can be controlled by a limit
set by the administration or a refusal
to accept transfers, but Parsons
hopes that this won’t be necessary.

Parsons does not expect any fur-
ther increase in the size of W&L, say-
ing “the thought right now is to
stabilize enrollment. ‘“‘One of the ad-
vantages of W&L is the close faculty-

student relationship. The larger we
get, there is some erosion of the sense

And to top it all off

of friendliness. The larger we get, the
more we lose the characteristics of
W&L.”

Parsons says he has not heard any
actual complaints from students,
faculty, or alumni; however, in
casual conversation her has heard
hopes that the university will not get
any larger. When he was a student
here in the mid-1950s, the ‘‘magic
number’”’ was 1,000, including the law
school. The number was then chang-
ed to 1,200, and now it is 1,500. ‘‘The
question is, when do we put on the
brakes,’’ said Parsons.

‘We have put some pressure on
ourselves and taken away some of
the qualities of th academic life and
social life,” he said, adding that
there is a “little sense of over-
crowding,’ in the Co-op, for exam-
ple. Some of the class sections have
also become overcrowded. With the
increase in enrollment, the percen-
tage of the student body that you can
claim to know goes down,”’ Parsons
said, Parsons believes that the feel-
ing that students and faculty have of
knowing everyone is important and
that there is ‘‘more anonymity” now

when one walks down the Colonnade.

Professor Sidney Coulling, who
began teaching at W&L in 1956, sees
the increase as a ‘‘trade-off’’.

“If you compare W&L ney to 30
years ago, there is a more diverse
faculty, an expanded curriculum,
and more extra-curricular activities.
In the organizations there is also
more diversity. For diversity you
have to have people to sustain it,”’
said Coulling, adding that for the
losses incurred by the increasing
enrollment, there are also ‘“‘compen-
satory gains in the expanded pro-
grams.”

This year the university hired its
first personnel director to do a job
that had been done by an ad-
ministrator as an extra duty in the
past. When you become “‘so big you
need a specific office and function to
deal with personnel,” said Parsons.
The increase in enrollment has a
“ripple effect’? which includes hous-
ing, food, and other additional
university services.

“The bigger you get, the more
complex it gets, and the harder it is
to get smaller,”’ said Parsons.

If you should ask any EC member
what he feels is his primary respon-
sibility to the W&L community, he
might reply, “defense of the Honor
System.’’ That seems obvious since
a large part of their job is to ad-
minister honor trials when the code
has been broken.

In accordance with that concentra-
tion on honor, the EC often seeks
ways in which it might improve our
Honor System. The National Honor
Conference, held this past weekend
at WEst Point, provided just such an
opportunity.

Vice President Pat Schaefer and
senior representative, Brandt Wood,
represented W&L at this conference
attended by nineteen other colleges
and universities.

The conference concentrated on
honor after said Wood college and
how its inception in the student dur-
ing the college years led to more
honorable members of the private
sector. Wood said that he was im-
pressed, if not shocked, at the speech
of one member of the business com-
munity who related the lack of honor
in his generation’s business practices
and pleaded with college students to
rectify that situation in our genera-
tion.

Other speakers discussed ethics in
government and the military.
Defenders of military ethics were
numerous since most of the colleges
in attendance’ were

States Merchant Marine Academy,
VMI, Citadel, and Norwich Universi-
ty.

Yet while both W&L represen-
tatives found the lectures educa-
tional, they believed they learned
more from discussions with other
students concerning their Honor
System.

The various schools represent/d
were divided into four groups.
Within these groups they discussed
how their systems were ad-
ministered and what offenses they
covered.

Schaefer said, ‘‘The strangest was
BYU.” Their code considered pre-
marital sex, drinking, and smoking
honor offenses and punishable by
suspension. Their system thus was
heavily codified, unlike W&L’s which
leaves the definition of honor to the
generation involved.

The military academies described
strict honor codes which disallowed
lying, cheating, stealing, and ‘‘those
who tolerate those who perform these
acts.’’ Students may be punished for
not turning an honor offender. The
White Book, on the other hand, does
not compel anyone to do the same.

However, most of the systems were
less strict than W&L’s. Wood in-
dicated that Princeton represen-
tatives to the conference announced
that their system only covers
academic affairs—that is cheating.
They believed their student body to
be too large to assess honor viola-
tions outside the classroom. Even in

EC members attend seminar

felt “‘squeamish about action against
the students for fear of law suits,”’ ac
cording to Wood.

Only the Engineering Department
of the Iniversity of Michigan has an
Hone System which also covers non-
acy demic offenses. Schaefer ex-
y_ained that their system is very dif-
ferent from ours in that Honor Board
members are appointed, not elected,
and punishment consists of anything
from suspension down to posting of
signs around campus.

One feature in which all other
schools, with the exception of UVA,
differed from W&L was in the ad-
ministration of the Honor System.
These schools allowed faculty total or
at least partial administration.

W&L and UVA were also the only
schools supportive of the single sanc-
tion of expulsion. Schaefer indicated
that when asked about our policy and
whether we believe that a truly peni-
tent offender should not receive a se-
cond chance, he said, ‘“‘Yes, you can
get a second chance, but not at our
school.’ Representatives from the
other schools chided him about this
statement for the remainder of the
conference. Schaefer added, ‘‘Many
thought that the single sanction was
too harsh.”

Even the military academies who
claimed to have single sanction
systems related their leniency
toward some ‘‘plebes”’ the equivalent
of VMI’s “rats’’ because they might
be ignorant of the system. Wood
said, “‘They are more likely to expel

Students tell of sharing houses with disturbed spirits

 

By Margaret Pimblett

Rockbridge County was establish-
ed by act of the Virginia Legislature
and Lexington named its county seat
in 1778.

With a history of more than 200
years, and houses which have existed
for much of that time, it is expected
that stories of ghosts, haunted
houses, and unexplained phenomena
would arise, particularly around this
time of year.

So today, only two days before All
Hallow’s Eve, we hear the tales of
three houses in Lexington and the
county which are homes of W&L
students.

You may decide for yourself
whether such happenings could have
really occurred, when...no one else
was in the room.

The old Higgins Place is past East
Lexington and beyond Bean’s Bot-
tom. The original section of the
house is between 150 and 200 years
old, but the house has had additions
as recently as a few years ago, accor-
ding to third-year law student Mur-
ray Stanton, who lives there with
senior Jim Williams.

The room which Stanton says is
haunted is in the older part of the
house, in the section where William’s
room is located.

Williams has not experienced any
phenomena resembling ghosts or
spirits, but Stanton said that he has
heard two different sounds coming
from William’s room during the past
two summers, when Williams has not
been living in the room.

“Oeeasionally, you'll hear a
woman’s laughter’’ in the room,
Stanton said, and at other times
‘you'll hear two men having a con-

versation at a normal voice level.’
Stanton said he has not been able to
understand what the men say, only
that there are two different men
speaking.

Stanton is not the only person who
has heard the voices. He said that a
previous roommate and a friend who
visited the house also heard the
noises from the room, although one of
them probably wouldn’t admit it.

“It only happens when no one is
staying in that room.”’

Thomas Herndon and Paul Eyerly
live in the Castle, an old stone
building at 8 S. Randolph St.

The Castle is one of the oldest
buildings in Lexington, having sur-
vived the fire of the late 1700’s that
almost destroyed the town.

During the nineteenth century, a
man named Phil Nunn lived in the
Castle. Nunn was a huge black man
who earned money by doing odd jobs
all around Lexington. He was so
large that he could not buy shoes to
fit, so he strapped planks of wood
beneath his feet.

Lexington residents always knew
when Phil was approaching because
they could hear the peculiar noise
that his plank shoes made as he walk-
ed along the street.

Phil managed to save a substantial
sum of money from his work, and as
the story goes, he hid all of it within
the walls of the Castle. Unfortunate-
ly, he had paper money, which the
rats in the building chewed to pieces.

After that, Phil insisted that he be
paid in coins, not currency, and con-
tinued to hoard his money at the
house. Some folks say that he began
to hide his money in a tree outside the
house just to be sure the rats couldn't

OPINION
Great

While students’ parents are here at Washington and Lee, it
seems to be a good time to look closely at what makes W&L
the special place that it is.

 

Of course, one of the things that stands out at W&L is the
the tradition that comes with the campus. Although many
traditons have changed over the years, many still endure.
The friendliness of the student body and administration on
the campus can always make a good impression on visitors,
prospective students, alumni and parents.

The Honor System is perhaps the most unique aspect of the
university. Not only are students on their honor not to lie,
cheat or steal, they are entrusted with running the entire
system. One would be hard-pressed to find another university
that allows the students to administrate a system that allows
for only one punishment, permanent expulsion from the
university.

The aspect of trust in the student body by the administra-
tion is a current theme at Washington and Lee. Although the
administration does try to provide guidance at times, the
students are generally allowed to run their affairs on their
own. The freedom W&L students are allowed teaches them
how to handle large amounts of responsibility. Therefore,
they are well-prepared to enter the working world.

Washington and Lee also provides encouragement for stu-
dent athletes. Even though no athletic scholarships are of-
fered, athletes are encouraged to develop their skills in a
sport because of love for the game and competition, not
because it is the only thing keeping them in school.

The encouragement the water polo team has received from
the student body this year also shows the students’ growing
involvement in sports. The team has set a goal for this
weekend’s game: to break the noise record set in the
Metrodome during the 1987 World Series. The Generals are
competing for the Southern Conference title against the Univ-
crsity of Arkansas-Little Rock. The Phi would like to en-
courage all parents and students to attend this game and give
the Generals all the support they can.

Naturally, there are some problems at this university, but
they all can be solved. A revival of the speaking tradition at
W&L would definitely improve the impression given to cam-
pus visitors. The speaking tradition, which requires that peo-
ple greet everyone they meet on campus (except of course, in
situations such as large crowds). This used to be enforced by
a student committee that imposed fines for violations. We do
not think that a fine system would bring this tradition back;
only student interest can do that. If students want to have a
university known for its gentlemen and women, this tradition
should definitely see a revival.

All in all, there are many aspects of Washington and Lee
that deserve special attention. Students also need to realize
that to keep this university the special place that it is re-
quires effort and involement. Otherwise, this school may be
a for the worse when we return as alumni, or perhaps
parents.

Wé&L

MY VIEW
By Frank Watson

 

 

In my last article I tried to point out
some of the prevalent problems
which face Washington and Lee to-
day, but I didn’t mean to sound too
disparaging. Certainly several situa-
tions here on campus can and need to
be improved upon, yet when it is all
said and done and when the dust has
finally settled, I think that W&L of-
fers one of the best liberal educations
in the country. Our student body has
an intellectual yet common sensical
approach to academics, our faculty
is devoted and accessible, and our
honor system is virtually unequalled
in excellence. Yes W&L, it is, in
many ways, a time to gloat. But how
can we best grasp that inexplicable
essence of W&L which distinguishes
it from the infinitisimal blurbs of
other colleges sunk in the privy of
abyss? Well let’s take a look at the
supposedly comparable colleges
which, probably at this very mo-
ment, some wire-rimmed, granola-
eating guidance counselor is pawning
off to his unsuspecting seniors as
W&L’s academic contemporaries.
How about Bennington College
located in the rural hills of Vermont?

Two chapels can change future of

MY VIEW
By Michael G. Herrin

 

Today, I stopped by the old admis-
sions office in Washington Hall, out of
curiosity to see what the Administra-
tion plans to do with the room.
Rooms always seem larger when
they are empty, and as I walked, |
looked around with this new perspec-
tive. As I glanced up, I noticed that
part of the ceiling was missing,
allowing one to look up through it.
The amount of space concealed by
this false ceiling is almost as big as
that below it. The room, when it was
new, was huge, and it had a balcony
at about the level of the new ceiling,
with a wooden rail still running along
its edge. A chandelier hangs in the
hidden space, its light now snuffed
out. From reading Crenshaw’s
history of Washington and Lee, I
guess that this room is, in fact, the
Chapel of Washington College.

Unfortunately, I think the con-
certed effort to cover up this
beautiful symbol of our past is in-
dicative of the attitude of the present
administration and board of trustees.

Pragmatism is held in much higher
esteem than aesthetics in this
modern age. There is no need for
such a grand room; let’s lower the
ceiling and erect partitions to make
better use of the space. Logic like
this robbed the Commerce School of
its central reading room: three
stories tall and capped by a magnifi-
cent dome. Logic like this interposed
cramped classrooms in the yawning
space of the Old Moot Courtroom. At
the same time these ‘‘logical’” deci-
sions were made in the interest of
space, more and more classrooms in
Washington Hall, the most spacious
rooms on campus, were transformed
into offices for the ever-increasing

You might have heard of this one
(and if you did you stayed away)
which sports the most expensive tui-
tion in the nation at around 14,500
beans a year. Here at Bennington,
where fraternities are about as
welcome as the plague, each student
devises his own custom-designed
academic “plan’’ that culminates in
a senior project. As you probably
guested, this school is heavy into the
arts with coed dorm rooms, twice as
many women as men, and a large
number of males who are light in the
loafers. Wow, I can just see it now! a
vertible 1960's hippie time warp com-
munity college where the students
spend half their time proving that
they really are not products of Nor-
thern preppy elite families even
though their parents can afford the
tuition, and the other half con-
templating the limitless possibilities
of a world utopia if only peace could
be achieved.

The bandleader of such nebulously
directed schools like that of Benn-
ington is none other the most lack
luster institution of the Ivy League,
Brown University. Sure, Brown of-
fers its students the hare brained
system of “pick your own courses”
but with an added twist: not only can
the students take their entire course
load on a pass/fail basis, but if a fail-
ing grade should occur it will be eras-
ed from the student’s transcript.
With the miniscule requirement of

bureaucracy of the administration.
It simply never occurred to anyone
either to limit the number of
bureaucrats or to house them off
campus: after all, many are never
contacted by students or faculty. The
ultimate irony will be the installation
of the Development office in the old
chapel: the worship of God replaced
by that of mammon. Our other

more obvious chapel still
stands. Its dimensions have been
enlarged, not contracted, since

General Lee’s time. It is structurally
sound, but it, too, has suffered burial
in the sense that its true purpose has
been concealed. General Lee built
the chapel as an expression of how
positive voluntary worship could be.
Although an Episcopalian, he did not
allow sectarian differences to pre-
vent him from taking his
predominantly Presbyterian
students’ needs into account. On the
contrary, he assumed spiritual as
well as administrative leadership of
the College, not through the force of
mandatory chapel attendance, but
instead by setting a positive spiritual
example. He attended services in the
Chapel regularly, and his students
followed his lead out of respect,
honor, and love for him and his God.

To the Editors:

 

 

The members of Alpha Phi Omega wish to
clarify the label of inconsistency attached to our
organization in last week’s article concerning
the General Volunteer organization.

Alpha Phi Omega acts as a service fraternity
with several goals, one of which is community
service. Last year, APO members held various
positions at Stonewall Jackson Hospital.
was a commitment to the hospital, in which APO
worked with patients in need of physical therapy.

twenty-eight credits for graduation,
even the slackest student should have
no fear when venturing into unknown
course areas. All this frivolity has
added up to a pent-up energy in the
Brown students, and as a result they
have begun to spin theories upon
theories about what the world should
be like. The most famous incident
was the cynaide pills debate in which
the student body felt that in the event
of a nuclear holocaust they should be
able to forego the slow death of radia-
tion by committing suicide with the
pills. The university prohibited the
students from distributing the pills,
and of course the students were
enragéd that they had been denied
their right to take their own lives. It
seems that under the bogus claims of
the university’s “liberal education”
the Brown students had logically ied
themselves to avoid life altogether in
haven of inconsequential thought, or
in what I like to call “Bon Jovi in-
tellectualism”’.

At the other end of the spectrum
there is the southern conservative
school Wake Forest University. Like
the other schools mentioned, Wake
Forest has a student body with high
SAT scores and intellectual ability,
but unlike the others it is largely
stagnated by a powerful Baptist
board of trustees. Through a forceful
affiliation with these Baptists, Wake
Forest has all its fraternities housed

named for him is still marked. It is,
however, empty. The garments of
worship, the organ and the pews
linger, but the place of worship has
become a museum and concert hall.
Although Lee Chapel has become a
shrine to the man who built it, this
transformation has subverted his
purpose in doing so. He built the
Chapel for the worship of God, not of
General Robert E. Lee.

Our two chapels are thus, in dif-
ferent ways, sadly in need of
revitalization. Fortunately for us,
however, the university stands at a
crossroads concerning the fate of
both. The old Washington College
chapel is now empty. It could be
restored, for use as a lecture hall.
The larger size of the school has
brought with it some large class sec-
tions, and the ‘‘new”’ hall would be a
welcome addition to the campus
facilities, as well as a showpiece for
the college. The University owns two
houses near R.E,. Lee Memorial
Episcopal church which can be
restored for use as office space. I
believe the re-introduction of
academics to Washington Hall will
help close the ever-widening gap bet-
ween the administration and
students.

As for our new chapel, General

in university dorms, and archaic
policies, such as limited visitatior!
nours to female dorms, are strictly,
enforced. In short, the social at-
mosphere found at Wake Forest is
severely hampered by its outdated
religious ties.

I think we are on to something here
about what makes or breaks 4
university: the way in which a liberal
education is interpreted by the
university. For Bennington and
Brown, a liberal eduation means let-
ting the student loose into the sea of
academics to do whatever the hell he
wants; I think this ultimately breeds
ludicrous situations like the cynaide
pill controversy no matter
how smart the students may be. On
the other hand, for Wake Forest a:
liberal education is an intellectual
pursuit which must adhere
somewhat to a set of religious:
guidelines. Both these views, I think ‘
are inadequate for a true liberal}
education. Washington and Lee has,
the desired equilibrium between a re-,
quired curriculum and _ social

freedom, and this is the backbone of’ °

our university’s success and uni-
queness. On the most part, the’
university is continually evaluating,
itself and not blindly plunging down
the road as these other schools are, ‘
and the future of W&L’s liberal,
education, as I think you can see,
rests upon a self-policing which these '
schools lack.

spell is just temporary, similar to a

for the unlucky reporter the slump
can perpetuate fearlessly.

Many of these unlucky individuals

Halloween which is not quite so

Initially, children are attracted to
"candy corn because, besides tasting

“continue eating the destructive

they have none left or their parents
make them go to bed; when they
wake up on November 1 their heads
hurt, they are dehydrated and mere-
ly saying the words ‘“‘candy corn’’
will throw them into convulsions.

By the time these disillusioned
youngsters forget about candy corn’s
illusion of good feeling it is Hallo-
ween again and they go through the
same thing. By the time the average
child reaches adolescence this
vicious cycle creates a subconcious
but pronounced pessimistic attitude
about the world. This pathological in-
hibition causes commonplace state-
ments like, ‘Why should I do my
homework or read literature if it’s
gonna hurt in the morning?”’ In the
meanwhile, countries like Japan,
which has a scarcity of candy corn,
are producing a better educated and
more enthusiastic generation.

perience involved, as you might
guess, candy corn.

It happened on a normal day, in a
mall, in the prime of my youth. I was
shopping with my mother and three
sisters when it was suggested that I
purchase some chocolate since
everyone was hungry. I had every in-
tention of getting chocolate but my
eyes were soon invited by the hyp-
notizing triangles.

You can imagine how dissapointed
my family was when I showed up
with four dollars worth of candy
corn. I ate the majority of this candy
corn alone and for those of you
unaware of how much candy corn
you can buy for four dollars believe
me when [ tell you it’s no small quan-
tity.

Tho next morning was very
unpleasant as I experienced candy
corn hangover at a toxic level. The
reprecussions of such an experience
are not obviously recognizable but
they definetely exist, even today. The
fact that I even wrote an article on
this shows that something must be
wrong with me.

The time for action is now. Crack
may be serious but candy corn is
devastating--threatening the future
of America. We need a ‘‘just say no”’
attitude to candy corn and millions of
government employees or a well run
company to help erradicate the pro-
blem before it’s too late.

‘Student spends summer

 

‘
+ By David McDowell
+ Staff Reporter

 

David Montgomery, a senior Euro-

«. pean history major, rubbed elbows,
literally, with Rockbridge County
* last summer. After his summer here
, Montgomery is of the opinion that

Washington and Lee students don’t
« really get to see Rockbridge County

up close. i

Says Montgomery, ‘Seems like
» you can go to W&L for four years and
don’t really see what it ]Rockbridge

* County is like.”

Most W&L students confine their
dealings with Rockbridge residents
* to professors, coaches, and other

university employees, and as Mon-
° * : :

tgomery is quick to point out, they
»are not representative of the

Rockbridge natives.
“T see them as more of an attach-
» ment to the student body than as part
of the county,” Montgomery said.

  

‘in Rockbridge County

From his experiences, Rockbridge
residents share his view of the W&L
community--somewhat remote and
not really concerned with county
issues,

Montgomery, along with a handful
of other W&L students, spent the
summer working at the Blue Bird
Bus Company in Buena Vista. Mon-
tgomery worked in chassis prepara-
tion; specifically, he took batteries
out of buses, drilled holes for hoses—
that sort of stuff.

Montgomery found his co-workers
amiable enough, describing them as
“real helpful’. Apparently his being
a college student created no unplea-
sant tensions with his fellow workers.

“They seemed to be pretty im-
pressed with ]Washington and
Lee[,”’ he said. ‘“‘They kidded us
about being college students, though.
They’d say stuff like,I bet you’re glad
you’re going to school so you don’t

Coulling writes book
about the Lee girls

 

By Margaret Pimblett
Staff Reporter

 

At this school, named after Robert
E. Lee, ask any student how many
children the Confederate general
had.

“Seventeen,’’ was one answer.

“T think he had 26,” another stu-
dent added.

And a third said, quite confidently,
“Lee had nine children.”

The person to ask for the answer to
that question is Mary Coulling,
author of ‘‘The Lee Girls’ (John F.
Blair, Publisher, Winston-Salem,
N.C., 1987, 242 pages, $19.95).

A book-signing party for Coulling
will be held Friday from 3 to 5 p.m.
on the main level of the W&L
Bookstore.

The book was officially released in
June of this year and has recently
entered its second printing.

Robert E. Lee fathered seven
children, including four daughters—
Mary Custis Lee, Anne Carter Lee,
Eleanor Agnes Lee, and Mildred
Childe Lee.

“The Lee Girls” is primarily an ac-
count of the life of those women, from
the birth of Mary, the eldest, known
as ‘‘Daughter,’’ through the
childhoods and early deaths of Annie
and Agnes, the closest of the sisters,
and the life of Mildred, often known
as ‘Precious Life,’’ the daughter who
spent more time than the others in
Lexington.

Necessarily, it includes informa-
tion about the general and his wife,
Mary Anna Randolph Custis Lee, and
the three Lee sons—George
Washington Custis Lee, William
Henry Fitzhugh Lee, and Robert Ed-
ward Lee Jr.

Publication of the book, Coulling’s
first, completed a process which had
taken more than 25 years of work.

During the 1950s, Coulling was
working for the Development Office
of W&L and writing for the Alumni
Magazine. She was looking through
some folders of letters in the W&L
library when she found an unmarked
folder containing letters written by
Annie and Agnes to a friend at West
Point. The letters were written while
the girls were students at the
Virginia Female Institute in Staun-
ton (now Stuart Hall).

“They were so spontaneous and
sort of ingenuous that I was just
charmed by them,”’ Coulling said.

The letters included topics with
which any college student can
identify—the food at the school,
names which they called their
teachers, jokes which were played on
the teachers, and the things they
needed to have sent to them from
home.

“It sounded so_ typically
teenagerish that I was just most in-
trigued,’’ Coulling said.

However, with her marriage tc

Lee Girls

 

Continued from Page 3
at W&L, and the birth of their three
children, she was unable to devote
time to continuing her research intc
the life of the Lee daughters.

The information she found was not
put to use until 1964, when Coulling
wrote a 20-page paper for a small
women’s literary club using the let-
ters and some books as sources for
information about the Lee girls.

“Nothing had been written about
any of the daughters,” she said.
‘More than 500 books had been writ-
ten about Robert E. Lee and one good
biography had been written about
Mrs. Lee, but not a single book had
been written about the younger
members of the family.”

Very few books about Gen. Lee in-
cluded facts about the daughters,
Coulling said, and those which did
mention the girls stopped at 1870, the
year of their father’s death.

After presenting her paper to the
literary society and to the
Rockbridge Historical Society, Coull-
ing was encouraged by Ollinger
Crenshaw, then head of the history
department at W&L, to expand her
work into an entire book about the
four daughters of Robert E. Lee.

In order to do that, Coulling had to
acquire permission from Mrs.
Hunter deButts, the last surviving
granddaughter of Robert E. Lee.

Coulling then spent time studying

 

letters at the Library of Congress,
the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and other archives.

The writing of the book was not
begun in earnest until the early
1980’s, when two of her children were
out of high school, and she found time
to work on her manuscript.

“T tried to write almost every morn-
ing for a couple of years,”’ Coulling
said.

Once the manuscript was com-
pleted, Coulling sent it to Mrs.
deButts for approval, and began
looking for a publisher.

“The New York publishers were
not interested, because they said
these women were not flamboyant
enough,” she said. Neither had they
married important people nor had
important children.

“That was their criteria—those
three reasons.”’

Next, she considered university
presses, but ‘‘they are all so strapped
financially that they can do little
besides their own regional works.”’

Finally she contacted the John
Blair Publishers of Winston-Salem, a
company specializing in regional and
biographical works. They accepted
her manuscript and published it after
Coulling retraced her steps and
double-checked all the letters she us-
ed in her research.

In the five months since the book
was released, Coulling has traveled
throughout the Southern and Middle
Atlantic states promoting her work

 

Neville Richardson, Howerton Visiting Professor of Religion.

and being interviewed about Gen.
Lee’s daughters.

She has appeared on television sta-
tions from Charlottesville to Myrtle
Beach, S.C., and has been on radio
1980s, when two of her children were
out of high school, and she found time
Winston-Salem, N.C., and Birm-
ingham, Ala.

Reviews of or articles about ‘The
Lee Girls” have appeared in nearly
all the major Virginia newspapers
and in papers in San Francisco,
Nashville, Birmingham, and other
large cities.

In November, Coulling will par-
ticipate in the Kentucky Book Fair,
an invitational authors’ fair which
this year will also include Rosalyn
Carter, Pete Rose, David Halber-
sham, and Harrison Salisbury.

In the midst of the promotion of
“The Lee Girls,’”’ Coulling has begun
researching the life of Margaret
Junkin Preston, known as_ the
““Poetess of the South.’’ She was the
daughter of a Washington College
president, wife of a founder of the
Virginia Military institute, and
sister-in-law of Stonewall Jackson.

In addition to writing poetry,
Preston ‘reviewed hundreds of
books,’’ Coulling said. In order to
learn more about the work of
Preston, Coulling has been taking a
course in Southern literature from
Prof. Severn P.C. Duvall this term.

Coulling’s research into the lives of
these Civil War-era women has

shown her the difference between the
social structure of that time and the
present.

She said that she thinks both Mary
Custis and Mildred, the two
daughters who lived beyond their
twenties, would have been happier in
a less restricted environment.

Neither woman ever married, and
Mildred divided her time between
Lexington, where she lived with her
brother Custis while he was president
of Washington and Lee, and the farm
at Romancoke, Va., the resident of
her brother Rob.

“Women were just supposed to
stay under the protection of a
brother” after the death of parents,
Coulling said. Only in the case of
widowhood or other financial
necessity was it acceptable for
women to earn a living.

The widow of J.E.B. Stuart, the col-
orful Confederate cavalryman, was
one who was forced to work by
necessity. She became the principal
of the Virginia Female Institute,
which was renamed after her, Coull-
ing said.

In researching her book, Coulling
said she was interested in writing
more than just the life stories of the
daughters of General Lee. She
wanted ‘not only to show the
biographical information about these
four women but to use their actual
words as reflections of social
history” of the “‘tough era”’ following
the Civil War.

Professor teaches apartheid class
from personal experiences

 

By Joe Caccamo
Staff Reporter

Howerton Visiting Professor of
Religion Neville Richardson loves
Washington & Lee. He says he loves
it because he is free here to teach and
learn in an atmosphere that invites
freedom of expression, not racial
supression.

Richardson is a white South
African Professor and Methodist
Minister who is on sabbatical this
year, teaching courses on theological
ethics and moral issues.

Richardson is currently teaching a
course titled Religion 150, Christian
Ethics and Modern Problems. The
class has devoted the first half of the
semester to examing apartheid in
South Africa, an issue Which
Richardson says has “affected my
life in virtually every way.”

Richardson is fervently opposed to
apartheid. He says that though he
could not help but benefit from it
materially because he is white, his
spiritual consciousness suffers from
it’s very existance.

Apparently, Richardson’s great
spiritual consciousness has been with
him since his childhood. Though
Richardson was born in England, his
family moved to South Africa when
he was four. He recalls his most
vivid childhood memory being at the
age of ten, when he watched a white
man, assisted by the white man’s
black employee, beat a small black
child severely, right out in the middle

Down...Down...Down

Professor of business predicts fewer jobs

 

By Robert MacPherson

Staff Reporter

 

Students graduating in the spring
of 1988 will have a more difficult time
finding a job than their recent
predecessors because of the 508-point
plunge of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average on October 19, according to
a Washington and Lee University
professor.

Joseph Goldsten, professor of
business, said last week’s crash on

Wall Street will lead to an overall
economic slowdown and, in turn, will
reduce the number of jobs available
to soon-to-be college graduates.

“Consumer spending is a major
driving force in our economy,”
Goldsten said.

“We will see a fall in housing starts
and a decline in sales of large ticket
items, such as automobiles.”’

According to Goldsten, many
economists were calling for a reces-
sion in 1989. Before the Dow’s record-
setting nose dive, the economy had

been experiencing what Goldsten
called the second longest growth
period in U.S. history. He said that
because the economy moves in a
cyclical fashion, a recession was on
the horizon.

“I don’t think anyone would have
forecast this type of drop,’ said
Goldsten. ‘‘It may go down further
before it stabilizes.”’

He said the crash can be attributed
to several factors. An overpriced
stock market, public sentiment at the
time of the crash, and “underlying

deterioration” brought on by deficit
spending by the federal government
all played a roll in the Dow’s dive.

“We were living beyond our
means,” the professor said. ‘“‘There
was a strong willingness on the part
of the consumer to take on large
debts.”

Goldsten siad that overpriced
stocks were a result of a large con-
sumer demand.

“Stock prices were driven upward
as a result of public euphoria,’’ he
said.

of the street. “I can still hear the
sound of his fists hitting the little
black boy’s face,”’ he says.

Apartheid is the system of segrega-
tion in South Africa, a system that
Richardson claims was designed to
suppress the black and deny the
black of any chance of social,
economic, or political mobility.

Suppression of the black in South
Africa is achieved, as Richardson
points out, “by every way con-
ceivable.”’

The South African educational
system, according to Richardson
functions to mentally condition

blacks into believing that they are in- _

ferior beings and that their goals in
life should be to serve their white
employeers well. ‘‘Black kids are
put in a system where they are ex-
plicitly trained to do blue collar
work,”’ he adds.

According to Richardson, even
many prominent churches in South
Africa condone apartheid by twisting
the meaning of the Bible to show that
blacks were inferior, even in the eyes
of God. “It kind of puts them in the
position of the Israelites, the Chosen
Ones, while it puts the blacks in the
position of tribal people.”

The only concern that Whites hve
for Blacks in South Africa is that the
Blacks get their jobs done, Richard-
son said.

Richard anti-apartheid sentiments
show in his professional life.
Richardson teaches in an integrated
school in South Africa and he
preaches his Methodist faith to an au-

He also said that deficit spending,
especially on a large scale, is gen-
erally not necessary during a pro-
sperous cycle of the economy. Accor-
ding to Goldsten, deficit spending
should be saved for an economic
recession.

“The idea is to spend during a
recession and to have a surplus dur-
ing a boom, although we haven’t had
{a surplus] in years, he said.

The federal government was suc-
cessful in using deficit spending to
reduce inflation in the late 1970s and

dience that is 75 percent Black.
Richardson admits that he has
“paid a price’ for soothing his
spiritual consciousness. ‘“‘You lose
friends, gain enemies and bad rela-

tionships, but there is a benefit from j

being'a friend to the Blacks.”

What about the future of the Black ;
in South Africa? Richardson is not
optimistic. ‘‘What we will have is a
bigger dose of what we already .
have...more repression.’’ Richard-
son says that although the Blacks ©
constitute three quarters of the,
population in South Africa, they don’t
have the military capability to ex-’
ecute any kind of successful revolt. ,
“Only a wild optimist would say that
the future looks good for the Black in ‘
South Africa,’ Richardson adds.

As for his own future, Richardson
is not sure where he wants to be after -
he leaves W&L at the end of this year. ,
But one thing is sure: he is very hap-
py here. Richardson marvels over ‘
W&L, it’s physical beauty and rich ,
tradition. He is especially fond of the

honor system. As for the students, ’
“they seem to be very responsive and |
eager to learn,” he says though he }

would like to see more minority ;

students being able to share in “‘the ,

great W&L experience.” f
Richardson, his wife, and their four ‘

children are living in Lexington. ,

Aside from his teaching, Richardson
is avidly involved in the Baptist *
Church sports of all kinds. He |
coaches soccer, plays squash and
loves to knock around cricket when +

he gets a chance.

‘

‘

for graduating seniors:

early 1980s but it should have been
stopped when it was no longer «

necessary, he noted. :

According to Goldsten, since
deficit spending was part of the
reason for last Monday’s crash, thé
government cannot expect to use it to
wipe out the impending recession?
Consequently, he is not optimistic
about the future of the economy.

“There is a feeling of ‘What do we
do now’,”’ said Goldsten. ‘‘There are
some fundamental problems that:
have to be dealt with.”’ :

After the death of his beloved wife,
Phil was not the easy-going man the
Lexington residents had known. He
became belligerent to his employers,
and morose around his friends.

People who walked along that sec-
tion of Randolph St. often looked
through the five windows of the Cas-
tle and saw Phil pacing in his rooms,
carrying his bag of money. And after
his death, some of those same people
insisted that when the moon was full,
they could see him still, shuffling up
and down Randolph St. in his plank
shoes.

Herndon and Eyerly have not seen
Phil in their house, but they have had
a few unsettling experiences. Hern-
don says the windows sometimes
open and shut by themselves, but
usually only on windy days.

And, on the first night that the two
were both in the apartment, Eyerly
was awakened by a scream from
Herndon’s room. Herndon said his
sheets were being pulled off his bed,
but no one else was in the room—no
one except the mouse that was runn-
ing across Herndon’s bed, dragging

 

the sheets along with him.
A woman ghost affectionately call-
ed ‘‘Madelaine’’ lives at 117

McLaughlin St., where Meredith
Walker and Keri Wessel lived last
year. °®

Walker said that one night Wessel
awakened to see a figure dressed in a

long gown ‘come out of the
bathroom” and into Walker's
bedroom.

“She thought it was me,”’ Walker
said, but then Wessel realized that
the gown was not a nightgown, but
rather a dress or evening gown, and
that Walker had not been awake in
the night.

On another occasion, Walker was
in her room reading, with both the
overhead light and the bedside lamp
turned on. After about 10 minutes,
Walker said, the overhead light went
off. No one else was in the room.

Walker said that often when she
was working in the kitchen, cooking
or washing dishes, ‘‘she’d be wat-
ching me.”’ As Walker explained, as
much as she can tell when someone
else is sitting in the next booth at the
co-op, “I'd know someone was there
behind me.”’

Walker’s upstairs roommate
nicknamed the ghost ‘‘Madelaine’’
and made up the story that she was a
woman who had been jilted by her
lover and later died of a broken
heart.

Within the house’s more than 100-
year history, someone did die there,
Walker said. But the victim was a
man who died after some sort of fight
nearby, not a despondent woman who
would return to the place of her unre-
quited love.

a senior than a freshman since the
senior is better indoctrinated in the
system.”

This was one area in which both
Schaefer and Wood thought they
might bring back some ideas for our
system. Schaefer indicated that we
might benefit from more “‘inter-
nalization” of the system, in other
words, each W&L student should con-
sciously apply the Honor System to
his actions. Schaefer thinks that
more frequent and intensive instruc-
tion in student awareness of their
honor and its importance might
greatly increase the effectiveness of
the Honor System.

Although W&L’s small size and
location in a small town struck many
of the other schools as ‘‘Utopia’’ ac-
cording to Wood, they were “im-
pressed with our success.” Wood

_ distrubuted many copies of the White

Book and explained the philosophy
behing our system and its founda-
tions in the character of Robert E.
Lee, who ironically was a graduate of
West Point.

Schaefer attributed our system’s
success to ‘“‘the lack of codification”
prevalent in other systsems. Wood
said, ‘“‘Other schools asked for per-
mission to use some of our ideas from
our White Book in their revisions.”
When asked what they really learn-

interested may inquire.
Although parts of Gaines
Residence Hall still remain

incomplete—scaffolding still stands
around its main lobby, the gatehouse,
the computer room is still not in use
and the enclosed courtyard still

ed from the whole weekend, Schaefer
simply responded, ‘‘I learned how
well our (honor system) works,” and
“how much I really appreciate
ours.”

Both Wood and Schaefer said they
realized that a system like ours
naturally works better at a small
private institution, however they
deny that it can only work in that

type of environment.
All in all our representatives to the
National Honor Conference

presented our system as best they
could. They are yncertain whether
many schools will actually imple-
ment either the single sanction or
student administration of their Honor
Systems, but they did what they had
intended before the conference, that
is to let these other institutions know
how serious we are about honor and
proud of the success of our systsem.
Wood called the weekend a “huge
educational experience.”’

While recognizing that ‘“‘we have
more student body participation than
other schools’’ Wood asked that all
students take a more active part in
their student government by atten-
ding the EC meetings each week,
Monday night, 7:00 PM. He added,
“We have ready access to the ad-
ministration.” Schaefer requested
that those who express their views
only through the Ring-tum Phi should
go to the EC with their problems so
that something may be done about
them. With such active participation
by the student body the Honor
System will be bolstered and student
grievances amended.

resembles an ancient Indian burial
ground—the finishing touches are be-
ing made to W&L’s latest $8.1 million
addition to the campus.

Most of the residents of Gaines Hall
are pleased with the end result.

“I think it was worth it,’’ said
junior Susan Lewis, in reference to
the school’s decision to build the
dorm.

“T really think the school made the
right decision in building the new
dorm in suite arrangements and in-
cluding a weight room and laundry
room,”’ added junior Courtney Har-
pold.

Currently Gaines Hall has an oc-
cupancy rate of 77 percent, with 112
of the 193 occupied rooms containing
women.

Assistant Dean of Students Ken
Ruscio says he expects the current
vacancies in Gaines Hall to vanish
next year as students begin to take
note of the facilities at Gaines Hall
and take advantage of them.

“It’s hard to tell, but in.talking to
students, I think demand will exceed
the number of available rooms,”’ he
said, although he added that the
housing demand would be difficult to
predict.

The reason Ruscio is optimistic
about Gaines Hall is because of the
great number of modern conve-
niences it has—such as an elevator, a
laundry room that features nine
washers and five dryers, and an ex-
ercise room containing the most
modern Nautilus weightlifting equip-
ment.

Two centuries after they adjourned
from Philadelphia, the framers of the
Constitution have reconvened at
W&L.

The arrival of the framers at W&L
comes through the generosity of

organization of university-appointed

activities such as film festivals,

Lane, when asked by the Alta Vista
Journal about her father’s reasons
for collecting signatures replied, ‘I
guess my father needed a focus. He
didn’t pursue the signers solely, but
was very much into the Civil War.”

The son of a veteran of the Spanish-
American war, Coblentz first
became interested in the history of
Nathaniel Greene. The minister ob-
tained 30 documents pertaining to
Greene, and then expanded his in-
terests to other areas of history.

A few examples of the entire collec-
tion include a letter written by

flooring of his newly built home,
Monticello.

group would work together to con-
solidate interest and learn more
about its particular academic in-
terest.

The most frequent complaint has
been concerning the long period of
time it has taken for the building to
be completed.

“It’s a drawback I suppose, but it
will be done,” said senior Andrew
Bouie.

Since last year, the sounds of
dynamite blasting, hammering and
sawing have prompted students to
complain, not only about the length of
time involved in finishing the
building, but the noise.

“It’s a hassle, but at least it gets
you out of bed,” joked Bouie.

Complications in weather and dif-
ficulties in completing the gatehouse,

Also included are a letter Stonewall
Jackson wrote when accepting his
commission in the U.S. Army, as well
as a letter by then-president of
Washington College, Robert E. Lee,
concerning the establishment of a
physical education program at the
college.

Lane said in regard to the collec-
tion, “It’s a fascinating world.” She
added though, ‘unlike a Van Gogh,
you can’t hang a manuscript on the
wall to ‘oooh’ and ‘aaah’ over.”

The display of the signatures adds
greatly to W&L’s existing collection
of documents and other historical ar-
tifacts.

Mrs. Lane said, ‘‘For all the money

which will connect the wings of the
building when completed, have been
much to blame for the delays in com-
pleting the building.

Ruscio, however, estimates all con-
struction to be completed on Gines
Hall by Dec. 1.

“(The construction workers]
decided to leave the gatehouse for the
end,’’ added Ruscio. The gatehouse,
which will serve as the central lobby
for the residence hall, will be design-
ed to accommodate lectures, con-
certs and meetings.

The new residence hall was named
for Francis Pendleton Gaines, presi-
dent of W&L from 1930 to 1959. It has
88 single rooms and 80 double rooms.

Ruscio said that housing applica-
tions for next year would be made
available to students next week dur-
ing registration for Winter Term.

The future of the signatures cur-
rently on display remains unknown.
The collection could be permanently
displayed at an institution, unless her
children demonstrate an interest.

As for now, though, the exhibit con-
tinues to be displayed in the Boat-

For those interested in further ex-

Student sponsors petition

 

By Jennifer Bandrowski
Staff Reporter

Rather than just complaining
about the big crowds at the Co-op,
one W&L student has actually tried to
do something about it.

Meredith Walker, a junior, cir-
culated a petition during the last two
weeks calling for additions to the
campus food store.

The petition, which Walker said
has garnered 300 signatures, reads as
follows:

‘What do you think about a bigger
Co-op and bookstore? Want a better
selection of food and more things to
charge home in the bookstore?

Interested in having more seating
in the winter time when you can’t sit

in the sun? What about a conve-
nience store with food, drinks, and
personal items with the option to
charge it home? If your interested in
any of these things, sign here!”’

“I did it as a favor to Mr. Darrell
(Director of University Food Ser-
vices),’’ said Walker. ‘‘We were talk-
ing about the horrible situation at the
Co-op...and I thought maybe a peti-
tion from the students would help.”

Treasurer Lawrence Broomall was
impressed with the student initiative.

“I think it’s a good indication of stu-
dent feeling about the condition
there,”’ he said.

Bookstore manager Tidge Roller
noted outdated facilities (such as the
“farm stove” used in the Co-op) and
a general need for more space.

“The thing that blew this one over

the edge was the point card,” Roller
said. The administration is aware of
the problem...and the petition may
have helped.”

Darrell said that when Walker sug-
gested a petition, ‘I said it certainly
couldn’t hurt...There’s a need for
enlarged facilities, and the ad-
ministration recognizes that.”

Broomall said, “It’s a problem
under study and has been for awhile
with no solution currently in sight.”’

‘“‘We’ve been talking (about it) for
around five years now,” Darrell said.

All noted that location is a big pro-
blem. They want the Co-op and
bookstore to remain central to the
campus, where it is easily accessible.

“| don’t know what will come out of
all this,’’ admitted Walker.

 

As the weather grows cooler, more students crowd into the co-op.

I went out fishing with him five times

opinion. But according to the library

the stacks are a major problem.

Meredith Walker, a junior who
works at the front desk, said she tries
to stop people with drinks as they go
by. During an average three-hour
shift, she stops 20 to 30 people.

“Rules are there for a reason.
They are there to protect books, not
to make people mad,’’ Walker says.

The problem, according to Univer-
sity Librarian! Barbara Brown, is
that the food and drink brought into
the library by students doesn’t
always end up inside the students.
Spills and crumbs left by the untidy
snacker result in damaged books and
stained carpets.

With the progress of Gaines Resi-
dent Hall at W&L comes a welcome
addition in the basement—a fully
equipped exercise room,

Currently the exercise room
features eight new Nautilus
machines, three cycling machines, a
treadmill and a rowing machine.

Over the next few weeks, plans are
in the works to put mirrors on the
walls, supply workout progress
charts and add other finishing
touches, such as a clock, a telephone
and benches for the dressing rooms.

Many students, particularly
Gaines Hall residents, have called
the new weight room a much needed
alternative to the weight room in

sophomore Cathy Williams. |

of preservation.

But the damages are not always
immediate. A spill will cut into the
useful life of a book. Warren says
that a book that was expected to last
for 70 years may only last 40 years if
damaged.

The food and drinks brought into
the library can also attract unwanted
guests, accordiffto Warren,

Insects such as ants, cockroaches
and silvét¥ish may choose to call the
stacks home if they have a reliable
source of food. Warren says that in-
sects pose an even greater threat to
books than do spills.

New books are expensive, and Bar-
bara Brown says that her goal as
university librarian is to safeguard
the university’s investment by pro-
tecting the collection, some parts of

more of.”

Williams said she also likes the

“You can go work out when you
look like hell and nobody sees you,”
said junior Melissa Anemojanis.
“it’s a more comfortable environ-
ment.”

During the year, the exercise room
will be open to anyone on campus

which are irreplaceable.

Brown says that it is not the job of
the staff to police the library. In-
stead, she has instructed the staff to
stop people when they see them, but
her real emphasis is on education.

There are signs and trash cans
throughout the library, and
periodi¢ally,,an exhibit focusing on
the enemies of books is erected on the
main level.

Students have some ideas on the
matter. Dave Dietz suggested that
certain areas be set aside for food
and drink.

Campus dogs are
allowed free reign

 

By Shawn Crawford
Staff Reporter

Just as the campus dogs are
treated with high regard at the
University of the South, W&L’s
canine companions are allowed free
rein within the student domain.

It is a common and reassuring
sight to see them romping about in
the Johnson grass in front of the
library, or to be fetching a stick for a
friend on the sloping green Colon-
nade. :

Yet with their seemingly boundless
territory and inexhaustible energy,
one might wonder if they overstep
their welcome and tread on the toes
of those less inclined to consent to
such liberty.

In 198 a W&L team of ar-
chaeolgists began to excavate the
Barger-Riddlebarger Farmstead in
Botetourt County.

Professors John McDaniel and
Kurt Russ, along with student Jeff
Blomstead, submitted a final report
of the farmstead called ‘‘Ar-
chaeological Investigations of a 19th

Century Appalachian Farmstead:
' The Barger-Riddlebarger Farm in
Botetourt County, Va.”

did,” added Head Nurse Mrs.
Josephine McCown.

Campus Security also denied hav-
ing any problems, though they joked
of complaints from professors who
thought that on Thursday mornings
“the dogs are brighter than some of
the students.”

Perhaps the most problems occur
at the dining hall where students are
willing to give the dogs leftovers.

Gerald Darrell, Director of Food
Services, says that the incidence of
dogs coming into the dining hall is
“not a real problem, but is an occa-
sional problem.”

“Sometimes the dogs aren't
agreeable, they don’t want to go out,
and that makes us uncomfortable,”’
he said.

He also explains that they have a
three-step policy toward removing
and controlling a dog in the dining
hall.

“First we ask the students if they
know whose dog it is. If the dog has a
tag, we'll look at that for a name and
will contact the owner and tell him to
come and get the dog. If that doesn’t
work, we call the dog catcher to come
pick him up,” he said.

Darrell expressed reluctance to
carry out the final step but explained
that it is against, Health Department
regulations to have a dog in an eating

disassembling the farm, piece by
piece, and transferring and
reassembling the structures at the
museum. The museum intends to ex-
hibit this farm and compare it to
others from other cultures. Pro-
fessor John McDaniel called this an
“amazing project.”

According to Professor Kurt Russ,
the excavation’s function was
primarily to find out “about the
lifeways of rural Appalachian peo-
ple, what they did, and how Euro-
Americans adapted to the environ-
ment.”’ Several students have been
involved in the excavation during the
past year, working long hours on the
project.

Systematically surveying the land,
using various excavating devices
along areas 5’ x 5’, the archaeologists
were able to discover. several
buildings and artifacts. The farm

establishment, and that this is their
policy.
Another area where the dogs
create a disturbance is in the library.
Meredith Walker, a student worker
at the library, said, ‘‘We normally
don’t have a problem, but they do get
in from time to time.”

Dick Grefe, a reference librarian,
said “There are problems. Nights
tend to be hectic. There were two
famous incidents last year where a
dog used the floor beside a carrel as a
restroom.”

He said that the dogs usually cause
the most problems when the seasons
reach their extremes, such as during
the winter when the rains and cold
pervade Lexington, and during the
“Dog Days’’ of summer when the

heat is unbearable.

A couple of years ago a concerted
attempt was made to remove any
dogs that were running around cam-
pus unsupervised, but this met
with great resistance from the
students and was not continued. Lex-
ington has a leash law which applies
also to the W&L campus, but which
has not been strictly enforced.

Since the library and the Dining
Hall have specific guidelines to con-
trol the presence of pets, it is ad-
visable that students and owners
alike respect these policies and
refrain from inviting the dogs inside.
However, as long as these few re-
quirements are met, the campus
dogs should meet no resistance to
their running free within the sanctity
of the W&L community.

a 19th century farm

consisted of a springhouse, corn crib,
smokehouse, granary, apiay,
washhouse, logbarn and tobacco
barn. The common agricultural pro-
ducts of the area consisted of corn,
wheat, fruit, vegetables, livestock
and tobacco. This farm was first pur-
chased in 1783 by William Maxwell,
and then bought and sold five more
times, eventually to the Rid-
dlebargers in 1884. Over this 100-
year span, the land occupied by the
farm increased greatly in size.

According to W&L’s team’s report,
the farm “was largely self-sufficient
and prosperous.”

One owner was known to grow
tobacco, own livestock and keep
bees. However almost every owner
built new structures on the farm,
oo varying the farm’s func-

ions.

Using a transit-excavating devise,

the team could locate areas
of activity. They found hundreds of
artifacts which they organized
“quantitatively to how they function-
ed in the past.”’

Russell also said that the outhouse
is particularly interesting ar-
chaeologically ‘because artifacts
like waste ends up there through
time.”

He says they ‘“‘can take ceramics
and quantitate a formula calculated
by an archaeologist in South Carolina
to find the date of when that ceramic
or structure was built.”’

The archaeology team states that
hundreds of sites similar to the
Botetourt Farmstead exist around
Lexington and neighboring towns.

Twelve other historic sites are
situated within a 3.5 mile radius of
the Barger-Riddlebarger Farm,
among pre-historic sites as well.

Bed and Breakfasts offer visitors a change of pace

As parents of W&L students are
probably all too aware, it is often dif-
ficult to find a hotel to stay at for big
weekends like parents’ weekend or
homecoming. Many hotels are often

booked solid years in advance fore-
ing parents to stay at hotels in Staun-
ton and Roanoke

There are some places to stay in
Lexington that parents may not be

familiar with. Bed and Breakfasts
are becoming more popular national-
ly and several bed and breakfast
homes and one bed and breakfast
reservation service have opened in
Lexington in the past two years. Bed
and breakfast owners take pride in
being a different sort of place to stay
compared to hotel chains.

Part of the charm of bed and
breakfasts is the atmosphere—
visitors feel like they’ve stopped by

to spend a few days with a friend.
Breakfast, generally a continental
spread of homemade goodies, is in-
cluded in the price of a room. The
proprietors take great pride in mak-
ing their guests as comfortable in
their home as they themselves.

that hard, I should work for myself,’’
said Thronber

She decided she wanted to own a
bed and breakfast guest home. She
set about looking for a suitable house,
discovering Lexington through in-
vestigating a house ad in ‘‘Mid-
Atlantic Country Magazine.” The
house she chose, even the way she’s
decorated it, all add to the guests
comfort.

The home that is now Llewellyn
Lodge was once a tourist home, so
Thornber didn’t have to do any major
renovations. Each bedroom already
had a bathroom and there is a park-
ing lot in the back.

Thornber has decorated the home
in “‘livable’’ furniture. There is a
dove gray sectional sofa in the living
room. All the bedrooms have roomy
beds. There are a few antiques and
knick-knacks here and there. The ef-
fect is tasteful decorations that are
durable—visitors won't mess up the
aesthetic quality of the room by sit-
ting down init.

Most of the guest of Llewellyn
Lodge are parents of students at
nearby VMI or W&L . ‘‘When I have
the parents here, particularly of the
VMI boys, they can come over, sit
down here, and it’s not like sitting in
a motel room. In the winter they can

 

 

 

Llewellyn Lodge

One Lexington hostess, Ellen
Thornber of Llewellyn Lodge,
created her business with the com-
fort of the visitors in mind, and even
her own lifestyle caters to her guests,
with her visitors winning out over
privacy.

“If they want to sit down here and
talk, that’s fine. I always welcome
them to sit down here. Lots of times
they just want to be alone. I think
that you have to be very flexible in
this business.”

Llewellyn Lodge, in the heart of
Lexington, has the destinction of be-
ing the area’s first bed and
breakfast. The half-century old
home offers five bedrooms, prices
varying from $35 to $65.

Thornber came to the Lexington
area two years ago looking for houses
to convert to a bed and breakfast.
She had spent 20 years in the
hospitality business, working for
airlines and travel agencies. Thorn-
ber was working 16 hour days as a
hostess in a restaurant in D.C. that
catered to ‘‘the White House crowd.”

‘‘! decided if I was going to work

sit by the fireplace and it’s like being
ina home, and they really like that.”’

Thornber helps her guests with din-
ner reservations and suggests things
to do and see in the area. Her fiance
even takes guests fishing occasional-
ly.
“T am flexible. I let people do what
they want, and they feel at home.”’

Just outside of Lexington is Pat
and Jim Tichenor’s Fassifern. The
Tichenors, who have become good
friends of Ellen Thornber, cater their
business toward a different crowd
than Llewellyn Lodge does.

Most of their guests are older
travelers, parents of local college
students, or members of the military.
The Tichenors do not accept children
under 16 in their bed and breakfast.
There are too many valuable, easily
breakable antiques, and _as Pat says,
“there is really nothing for a child to
do here.”

Fassifern, a large manor house
built in 1864, offers six rooms, most
with private baths, for $35 to $55.
Each of the rooms is decorated under
a theme ranging from the simple

Country room to the ornate Austrian

The Tichenors add many special
touches to their business. Pat has
made many of the quilts which top
the beds. Jim’s sand and driftwood
candles grace the dining room man-
tle. They are eager to offer you hors
d’ourvre and some conversation in
the evening.

The house is decorated with anti-

ques and artifacts collected during

Jim’s tour in the military. Ask about
the masks from Jim’s tour of Africa,
or their collection of antique guns
(one from Saudi Arabia features a
butt made from a monkey’s skull. )

The Tichenors spent over 25 years
moving about the world while Jim
served in the military. They dream-
ed about running an inn when Jim
retired, but when the couple was sta-
tioned in Hampton, they began to
search actively for just the right
home.

“‘We looked at close to 100 houses in
two years and put about 20 or 30 thou-
sand miles on the car,” said Pat.

The couple discovered Lexington
when they stopped for the night dur-
ing a trip hunting for houses in West
Virginia. Later, like Ellen Thornber
of Llewellyn Lodge, they saw an ad
for a home in the Lexington area in
“Mid-Atlantic Country Magazine.”’
That home is now Fassifern Bed and
Breakfast.

The Tichenors had to do major
renovations to get the home ready.
They moved in May of 1986 and work-
ed night and day to get it ready for an
August opening (they already had
reservations). Additional bathrooms,
refinished floors, and improved
plumbing and wiring are the results
of their efforts.

Fassifern is a five-minute drive
from Lexington, just this side of the
new Virginia Horse Center.

Slightly farther away, a 15-minute
drive, is Baleony Downs, run by
Catherine Clayton. The 185-year-old
white plantation house is five miles
south of nearby Buena Vista.

The two-story frame house backs
up against the Blue Ridge Parkway.
Beside the manor house is a small
airstrip, punctuated by a_blaze-
orange windsock. An immense brick
barn, the heavy fallen timbers of tis
roof visible through the arches of its
windows, sits beside the home.
Squatting in front of the barn is the
plantation’s stone icehouse, looking
much like a Scottish shepherd’s cot-
tage.

Mrs. Clayton is a transplanted

ried an American during the war and
they came to Rockbridge County in
the 1950s. When her husband left her
several years ago, Mrs. Clayton went
to work as a desk clerk for the Lex-
ington Historic Inns. She loved inn-
keeping so much that she decided she
wanted to go into the business for
herself.

Her son, who is an airline pilot, of-
fered to buy a home for her as a per-
sonal investment. Mrs. Clayton
knew just what home she wanted.
She had been friends with the owners
for several years and loved Balcony
Downs.

She has plans for her bed and
breakfast. Right now two bedrooms
are available to be rented, both on
the second story. One has a private
bath and features a large brass bed
and working fireplace. The other has
a reproduction “South Carolina rice
bed,’’ a high bed of dark, handcarved
wood.

A third bedroom, over the
breakfast area, is being renovated.
Once probably used as the servants’
quarters, it is reached by steep, nar-
row steps. The sloped ceiling with
exposéd beams and small windows at
floor level remind Mrs. Clayton of a
ship’s cabin. She plans to decorate it
in a nautical theme.

Mrs. Clayton hopes to turn the
brick barn into a restaurant and
youth hotel. The stone icehouse will
someday be the honeymoon cottage.

Most of the furniture is the Clayton
family’s. The only new things the
bed and breakfast required were
large beds.

“T was pleased to see that my fur-
nishings fit the house almost perfect-
ly. The mantle (in the breakfast
room) was the perfect place to put
my antique pewter collection. One
cupboard in the living room fit an
alcove by the center fireplace with
only an inch to spare.”’

She says she is not in the bed and
breakfast business to get rich, but
hopes to eventually generate enough
money to pay for the costs of the
business.

She charges between $30 and $50
per night fora room. ‘“‘I think people
should have a nice place to stay
without having to pay a lot of
money.”

Balcony Downs, which opened just
this January, gets its customers
mainly from local colleges and

visitors’ center referrals. Mrs.

Clayton says many of her guests
have said they heard about Balcony
Downs from other travelers while

 

many hikers—Balcony Downs is just
down the mountain from the Ap-
palachian Trail.

Another bed and breakfast off the
beaten path is Osceola Mills Inn in
Steele’s Tavern, about a 20-minute
drive north of Lexington.

Its owners, Paul and Kathy
Newcomb, like the Tichenors, con-
ducted a search for the perfect place
for a bed and breakfast. The couple,
at that time living in Grand Rapids,
Michigan, came up with a set

business is so they could work at
home in order to spend more time
with their two young sons. The fami-
ly feels their closeness adds to tie
homey atmosphere of the inn. ;

‘We're doing this to raise our fami-
ly, so it is our living,”’ said Katity
Newcomb, adding that they try {0
“keep the homey flavor that we want
to maintain, because that’s what
staying in an inn is, sharing some-
one’s home.” :

of criteria for their new business.
They looked up and down the East
Coast and as far west as Missouri to
fit their requirements.

The site they decided on was an
1849 mill that includes a miller’s
home. Until 1969, the mill produced
products under the ‘‘Flavo’’ label.

The mill and manor house needed
major renovations. Although the
mill had been used as a home, both
the plumbing and wiring needed an
overhaul, and the third floor, which
had not been touched since the mill
closed, was still full of corncobs and
almost eight years of grime.

The three story slate-blue mill now
houses four guest rooms, living
quarters for the Newcomb family,
and a dining room where breakfast
and dinner are served. The
Newcombs added a private bath for
each room. The manor house, now
gutted, is being replastered. The
family also plans to get the mill
wheel running again with the year.

*
to accommodate youngsters. Finding
durable furniture that fit the
period of the historic mill was a pro-
blem. The mill is decorated with
reasonably priced reproductions.
The family sells the furniture, using
their bed and breakfast as 4a
showroom and supplementing their

income in the meantime. :

If you would rather not be around
children, the Newcombs can still ac,
commodate. They plan to make the
manor house exclusively for adults,
featuring antique furniture and a,
music room.

‘

Outside, there is a swimming pool,
beside the mill to keep kids of all ages
occupied. Or guests can fish or wader
in the nearby Marl Creek. Kathy,
Newcomb also fixes guests picnic
lunches (‘‘grinders, of course’’) fore
guests going on hiking trips or
visiting nearby historic sites, such as*
Monticello or Ash Lawn. .

Osceola Mills Inn also features a
honeymoon cottage with a whirlpool
spa by a huge stone fireplace. The
building used to be the mill store.

Unlike many bed and breakfasts,
Osceola Mills Inn welcomes children.

chose to go into the bed and breakfast

- Women’s Center adopts historical names

Staff Reporter

 

The Women’s Center Advisory
Board has renamed the Women’s
Center after two historical women at
Washington and Lee University—
agg Childe Lee and Mary Custis

“We wanted to name the rooms
after someone historical,’ said
Meredith Walker, chairperson of the
board and manager of the center.

Walker sought the help of Mary
Coulling, author of ‘‘The Lee Girls’,
for suggestions concerning the name.
Coulling felt the names would be ap-

propriate for the two rooms in the
center because of their involvement
while living on the campus, said
Walker

The room used as a study room is
named for Mary Custis Lee, while the
room used as a television room is
named for Mildred Childe Lee. The
entire center has been renamed the
Arlington Women’s Center, said
Walker.

Walker said the decision to use Ar!-
ington for the name of the center was
appropriate since that was where the
women were born and grew up. The
board felt it tied the women together,
she said.

Coulling said the women were very
involved in the activities on the cam-
pus for the five years that their

‘Three Sisters’ play to open
Saturday parents weekend

aaa enema ee eel
By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

 

Production of the W&L Drama
Department's first play of the 1987-88
school year is expected to be com-

', pleted in time to kick off Parents’
_ Weekend.

Professor Al Gordon, head of the

_ W&L Fine Arts Department, is direc-

ting ‘The Three Sisters,’’ a 4-act play
by Russian playwright Anton

’ Chekov.

Set in 19th century Russian, The

, Three Sisters is about the inability of
_ three well-educated sisters to control
_ their own lives during the militaristic

period prior to the Bolshevik Revolu-
tion.

“It’s also about the decline of
genteel society before the revolu-

’ tion,’”’ said Gordon.

Gordon said he chose to do the play
for several reasons.

“(The drama department] tries to
hit all the periods over a certain time

’* span,”’ he said, ‘‘and we hadn’t done

this [period] in a while. Most of the
people in the play are young and I

~ wanted the students to have lots of

parts. And another thing is that

- everybody has a group part. No one

person has a dominant part.”

The three sisters are being played
by junior Delia Ford, a drama major

  
      
 

 

         
     
     
   
       
   
  

from Atlanta, and freshmen Tait

North of Great Falls, Va. and Gena
Woolner, of Vienna, Va.

The two other major characters,
Andre, the brother of the three
sisters, and his wife Natasha, are be-
ing played by freshman Harry Pen-
ner, of Hellerup, Denmark, and
Monica Burke, a drama major from
Yardley, Pa.

Admidst the hammering and saw-
ing going on around the set, Gordon
says he is optimistic about opening
night.

“The actors are doing well and the
set is doing well,’”’ he said. ‘“‘Opening
night will be a big turnout due to the
parents, but of course, we want the
students to come too.”

Gordon added that there would pro-
bably be a substantial turnout frum
the Sweet Briar Drama Department
since they are also currently produc-
ing ‘“The Three Sisters.’’ Gordon said
Southern Seminary College had plan-
ned to produce the play but had a
change in plans.

Other works by Chekov include
“The Cherry Orchard,’’ ‘“‘Sea Gull”
and “Uncle Vanya.”’.

Opening night for the play will be
Friday, October 31 at 8 p.m., with a
matinee to be ormed at 3 p.m.
Saturday. The play will then run
November 4-7. Reservations can be
made by calling 463 :

father was president of the universi-
ty

She said Mary Lee was born in 1835
and Mildred Lee was born in 1846.
Coulling felt that since the women
were born before the Civil War and
lived into the 20th century, ‘they
would be the model type people”’ the
advisory board was looking for.

Walker said the center was design-
ed for the use of all W&L women
which includes undergraduate and
law students, as well as the faculty
and staff and their guests.

She said the Arlington Center can
be accessed 24 hours a day, but after
11 p.m. the outside entrance facing
Washington Street will be locked and
the center can be entered by the side
stairway in the University Center.

The study room will have reserved

quiet hours from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.
Sunday through Thursday, but the
television room will be available 24
hours a day. It may be reserved by a
woman for the maximum of four
hours and must be done through a
reservation/liability form, which can
be done through Carol Calkins in the
University Center, she said.

Alcohol is not permitted at any
time in the center. This rule is in ac-
cordance with the alcohol policy of
the university, she said.

Walker said the center is to be used
by the women, but they may invite
men as guests.

“This is a place for women to go
and hang out. It was created to pro-
vide the women with a place they
could call their own,”’ said Walker.

Football’s losing streak is now

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

For the second week in a row, the
Washington and Lee football
Generals hit the road. And, for the
second week in a row, the Generals
were trounced.

Playing in the University of the
South’s Homecoming game _ in
Sewanee, Tenn., the Generals gave
up 24 points in the first half of their
way to a 38-13 blowout and their third
loss in as many games.

‘We just weren’t able to execute on
offense,” said W&L head coach Gary
Fallon, ‘‘and defensively we just
weren’t able to contain them and
keep them off the scoreboard.”

Just as they did on Oct. 17 against
Hampden-Sydney, the Generals gave

up three touchdowns before putting
any points on the scoreboard. The
Tigers scored twice in the first
quarter, on a one-yard run by
tailback Jock Craig and on a 15-yard
pass from quarterback
Bobby. Morales to. slot-back Greg
Glover. Craig picked up his second
touchdown of the day on a three-yard
carry with 9:11 left in the second
quarter. Morales added all three ex-
tra points.

The Generals scored their first
points more than 22 minutes into the
game on a pass from sophomore
quarterback Phil Sampson to senior
tight end Gar Prebor. Freshman
Carter Quayle added the extra point
to make the score 21-7 with 7: 15 left in
the first half.

The Tigers answered back with a

‘Easy competition’ is blown
away by the men’s squad

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team literally cruised
to easy victories over Bridgewater
and West Virginia Tech last Saturday
on the General’s home course.

The women’s cross country team
also picked up a relatively easy win
when it downed West Virginia Tech.

The score showed that W&L finish-
ed with 15 points, followed by
Bridgewater with 49, and then West
Virginia Tech which scored 71. The
meet, however, was even more lop-
sided than the score.

“It was an easy meet for us, in the
sense of competition,’’ said head
coach Dick Miller.

Easy, indeed. The Generals took
command on the first lap of the race
with freshman Larry Pilkey, senior
co-captain Scott Rippeon, junior Bill
Clark and senior Richard Moore run-
ning as a group and distancing them-
selves from the rest of the pack.
W&L, now 5-2 on the season, never
looked back and the race was pretty
much over by the first-mile mark.

“We ran well together and we pro-
bably ran as well as a team as we’ve
run all year,”’ said Miller. ‘‘It does in-
dicate that we’re rounding into pretty
good shape and starting to work to-
gether.”

seconds left in the half, making the
score 24-7 at the intermission.

The third quarter was much more
balanced than the first half. The
Tigers struck first on a 27-yard run
by Craig with just over seven
minutes left in the period, but the
Generals responded with a 13-yard
pass from Sampson to senior slot
back John Roe. Quayle missed the
extra point, so the score was 31-13
with 3:14 remaining in the third
period.

Sewanee’s Craig recorded his
fourth TD of the day of the day less
than two minutes into the fourth
quarter. Morales’ fifth extra point of
the day ended the scoring and gave
the Tigers a 38-13 victory.

Looking at the game as a whole,
Fallon was very impressed with the
play of Morales. Fallon said the fifth-

The Washington and Lee football
‘Generals “‘had better be ready for an
intense ball game’’ against the
Bridgewater College Eagles (2-5)
Saturday, according to W&L head
coach Gary Fallon.

The Eagles’ losing record is no
reason for the Generals to be compla-
cent, said Fallon. ‘‘When it comes
game day, those Bridgewater people
really want to get after W&L. We've
seen performers on their team not
play so well in other games, and then,

all of a sudden, they come up against
us and they’re supermen.”’

The Eagles run a Winged-T offense
led by a four-year veteran at quarter-
back, senior Jim DeLucas (6-0, 170).
A native of Woodbury, New Jersey,
DeLucas has completed 39 of 78
passes for the Eagles this season.

Bridgewater's leading ball carrier
is sophomore fullback Anthony
Lawrence (5-9, 175), who averages
more than 120 yards per game. Cur-
rently the number-two rusher in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference,
Lawrence has gained 852 yards on 173
carries this season. ‘‘He can score
from any place on the field,” said

Fallon. ‘‘We’re going to have to real-
ly work at containing Lawrence.”

The Bridgewater defense is an-
chored by senior tackle Mark Saun-
ders (5-10, 230), a two-time all-ODAC
performer, ‘‘Mark is our best football
player, there is no doubt about it,”’
said head coach Dan Antolik. ‘I
don’t think there is a coach in our
conference who wouldn’t want him in
their starting lineup.”’

The Bridgewater defense will also
feature the Eagles’ leading tackler
from 1986, junior linebacker Mark
Wheeler (6-1, 190). The Buena Vista
native was an all-State performer
while at Parry McCluer High School.

Rippeon finished first in a time of
28:34 over tne 8-Kilometer course and
he was followed by four, count’em
four W&L runners to complete the
wipeout. Clark came in second in
28:34 with Moore (29:54), Pilkey
(30:30) and senior co-captain Rick
Norris (30:31) close on his heels.
Miller was especially pleased with
the performance of Norris.

“Rick's picking up and moving up

closer to Larry. They were basically
running against themselves. Rick
and Larry worked very closely on
Bridgewater’s No. 1 man and he fell
behind them on the third mile.”’

The women’s team, 2-2, truthfully
were running against themselves, as
runners from the other schools were
no-shows and Tech was only able to
field a single runner. Freshman
Paige Cason broke her own school
record for the second time, finishing
the 5-K course in 23:56. The day,
however, was more of a workout for
the Generals than a competitive
race.

Both teams enjoy their third-
consecutive weekend on the friendly

on Saturday. The men compete
against Hampden-Sydney and
Eastern Mennonite at 11:45 a.m. with
the women taking on Lynchburg and

Freshman Paige Cason breaks her own school record for the

second time on Saturday.

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball Generals lost two starting
players to injuries during a intra-
squad scrimmage at halftime of
Saturday’s game against the
University of the South.

Junior center Rowan Taylor
broke his leg and will be out for
the rest of the season. He is ex-
pected to return to Lexington to-
day after a five-night stay in a
Tennessee hospital. Senior
linebacker Chris Jerussi suffered
a sprained knee. According to
head football coach Gary Fallon,
Jerussi is expected to practice
Wednesday and will be able to
play this weekend against
Bridgewater.

Trailing 24-7 at halftime, Fallon
said his players weren’t executing
on either side of the football.

‘‘We weren’t tackling, we were
grabbing at people,’ said the
W&L head coach. ‘We just
weren’t playing aggressive
defense. Offensively, we were
coming up with an effort, but we
just weren’t blocking with ag-
gressiveness,”’ said Fallon.

“‘Sometimes, you have to give
credit to the opponent for making
things happen, but it just looked
like we were falling down in our
basic tackling and blocking, our
fundamentals.”’

Fallon said he was optimistic
going into the game about the size
and skill of the Sewanee team and

 

players was the only reason for

 

 

‘Rowan Taylor

expected the score to be close
throughout the afternoon. Conse-
quently, he was very surprised by
the Tigers’ 17-point lead at the end
of the first half.

“T thought, ‘I’ve got to do
something to instill some ag-
gressiveness in these youngsters,
to get their intensity up...’ We’re
still in the ball game, I feel, [and]
I’ve got to do something to shake
the cobwebs out of our players’
heads and get them playing with
aggressiveness. I went to
something that I’ve used in the
past: to line up in the end zone
and go back to the basics of good,
aggressive blocking and ag-
gressive tackling.”’

Fallon said motivating his

Men drop two straight to
Johns Hopkins and Tigers

 

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

After obtaining two victories last
week to even up its season record at
5-5, the Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team dropped back down to
5-7 with losses to Johns Hopkins
University and Hampden-Sydney
College. The General’s Old Dominion
Athletic Conference record now
stands at 3-2.

Last Sunday, the Generals traveled
to Johns Hopkins for another tight
defensive struggle. Hopkins was only
able to score one goal the entire
game, but that was all it took to sur-
pass W&L and come away with a 1-0
victory.

Yesterday afternoon the Tigers
journeyed over from Hampden-
Sydney to challenge W&L on Smith
Field. H-S scored early in the game,
but sophomores Patrick Brown and

Scott Levitt teamed up to put the
Generals back on top 2-1. That score
remained until tne last minute of the
game when H-S floated one into the
back of the net to send the game into
overtime with a tie score of 2-2. H-S
was able to score once more in the
first part of the overtime and the
Tigers held on for a 3-2 victory.

As junior goalie Sheldon Clark
pointed out after the game, ‘‘It was a
really lopsided one.’’ Without the ap-
pearance of the deceiving score-
board, a stranger passing through
would have seen nothing but General
aggressiveness and dominating play.

Sophomore Jeff Caggiano agreed.
“We were outplaying them the entire
game,” he said. ‘‘There’s no reason
why we should have lost to them.”

W&L will face Millersville Univer-
sity at home on Smith Field at 3:00
p.m. this Saturday for Parent’s
Weekend.

 

Second guessing; not a good call

 

Shades on sports
By Mike Shady

 

 

 

Sports Editor

 

 

It’s easy to second guess someone. You already have the results and
the course of actions taken to obtain those results. All you have to do is
sit back and point out what you would have done differently and how
things would have turned out for the better. Yep, it’s so easy, perhaps
too easy, to second guess someone.

I’m not going to second guess what Washington and Lee head foot-
ball coach Gary Fallon did last Saturday against the University of the
South. Fallon was unhappy with his team’s intensity during the first
half, so instead of going back to the locker room and talking things
over, he kept his team on the field and had an intra-squad scrimmage.

The results were tragic, with junior center Rowan Taylor breaking
his leg and senior linebacker Chris Jerrusi suffering an injury that
kept him out for the second half. The Sewanee fans were laughing at
the Generals—probably thinking our whole football program was a
joke. Instead of firing up his squad, Fallon possibly threw away any
shred of team morale still left for W&L. It was, all in all, an ugly scene.

But what was the intent of Fallon when he kept his players on the
field? Was he trying to humiliate them? Was it some morbid attempt
on his part to embarass the University and the athletes representing
this school? I don’t think so. Fallon was there to win a football game,
and he was doing all that he could to get his team fired up and play
good football. Hell, the Generals were still in the ballgame, only trail-
ing 24-7. With quarterback Phil Sampson and an excellent corps of
receivers, a spread of 17 points is not an insurmountable lead.

This is my third year at W&L, and I have known Gary Fallon since

my freshman year when I shot (and still do shoot) the video tape for
the away football games. I have nothing but admiration for Fallon and
what he has done for the W&L program. Since coming here in 1978,
Fallon has an overall record of 46-40 and had compiled six-consecutive
winning seasons before last year’s 2-7 disappointment. He obviously
knows how to coach.

He also knows how to handle young men. When I try to think of a
word to describe how the football players feel about their head coach,
“respect”’ alway comes to mind. Fallon is a true believer in the
philosophy of academics first and then athletics, with the goal of
molding every person into a scholar-athlete. His players have always
shown class, win or lose, and that comes from nowhere else but the
head coach.

Maybe Fallon made a mistake. Then again, maybe he didn’t. What
if the Generals had not had those injuries and won the football game?
Fallon would have looked like a genius. Who’s to say what is the right
or wrong way to do something?

I didn’t agree with Fallon’s decision on Saturday. I would have done
things differently. Looking back, Fallon himself has apologized for
what happened and said that perhaps he made a mistake. Hey, we are
all human beings and we all make mistakes. It’s so simple to play
Monday morning quarterback. However, sometimes we aren't:
qualified to make that second guess.

the Chicago Bears a run for their money. Remember, you heard it

Soccer teams are beaten

Women end season with loss
to Hollins but look to next year

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

Although the Hollins playoff game
on Tuesday ended in a loss for
Washington and Lee, the women’s
soccer team is not evaluating its
season performance on the basis of
that one match. Head coach Janine
Hathorn thinks the Generals had a
“winning season,’ choosing to focus
more on the effort and improvement
of the team rather than its 2-8-3 final
record.

The Randolph-Macon Women’s
College contest last Saturday was
W&L’s last match of the regular
season, and the game proved to be an
impressive 4-0 victory for the
Generals. Two goals were scored by
sophomore Catherine Baillio, who
also had two assists, and sophomore
Joelle Jackson and junior Alexa
Salzman each had one goal apiece.
This was the first time W&L had a
chance to play strong offense. As
Hathorn observed, the team “‘learn-
ed how to really work with one
another and make goals.”’ Hathorn
considered this to have been a very
satisfying game since W&L was
finally able to effectively execute its
method of offensive play.

The Hollins game, however, was
frustrating. After a 43 lead at
halftime, W&L lost 6-4. Scoring for
the Generals were junior Catherine
Christian, Jackson and Baillio—who
finished the season as W&L’s top
scorer. The scoring rebounded
throughout the first half, but the
Generals again encountered difficul-

or its football team, because these
young men mean a great deal to
me.”’

Fallon said ‘‘the last thing I
ever wanted’’ was for someone to
get hurt. “I’m very sorry that had
to happen, and I apologize for the
whole situation. I certainly feel

badly about the two young men
who were injured.”

Given the same situation and
the same results, Fallon said ‘“‘I
probably would not make that

ty sustaining strength in the second
half. Hathorn subbed players for the
defense, which was not competing up
to its usual standard. This move
restored some defensive control yet
failed to help the team offensively.

The team had other crippling fac-
tors to overcome. The sweeper, soph-
omore Beth Stutzmnn, suffered a
broken collar bone in the game
against Lynchburg on Oct. 21, and
her contributions were greatly miss-
ed. Also, the R-M game had not been
defensively challenging and, there-
fore, it did not serve as advantageous
preparation for the game against
Hollins.

“We're inexperienced enough so
that it’s difficult to adapt day-to-
day,’’ Hathorn said.

The team was pleased about com-
peting in an Old Dominion Athletic
Conference post-season game,
though, and thought that, according
to Hathorn, ‘‘winning would have
been the icing on the cake, so the loss
does not matter except that, given
the halftime score, we really should
not have been defeated.”

Hathorn is anxious for next year’s
season and anticipates success. She
is optimistic about adding more team
members.

“T hope that the notoriety of our
spirit and respectable playing will
draft the women soccer players here
who were hesitant to try out because
they weren’t sure of what to expect. I
think we’ve shown them, as well as
everyone else, that this team is
serious and talented, and it is
realistic to have high expectations
for next year,”’ she said.

halftime.’’ But, if the inuries had
not occurred, Fallon said if the
Generals ‘“‘did go out there and
play with more intensity [in the
third quarter], I probably would
make the same decision, if I felt
that was needed.”

Summing up the events of
halftime, the tenth-year head
coach said, “‘By no means did I
want our young men to get hurt or
to be embarrassed, or to embar-
rass our university. And if that
did occur in people’s minds, then I
owe them an apology, because
W&L means a great deal to me. I
respect our student body, and I
certainly respect our football
team.”’

Macabre’s All

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

For some strange, unexplained
reason, every one of us has a fraction
of our psyche that enjoys being
frightened, shocked, and_ totally
disgusted. I mean it’s not as if wat-
ching someone be butterflyed (Julia
Childs style) or eating pancreas is
normal behavior. It’s not. It’s weird
and it’s scary; but people have the
need.

Every since Robert Wiene directed
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari in 1919,
horror movies have been a favorite of
movie-goers around the world. In
1931, the genre broke wide open with
the premier of Frankenstein starring
Boris Karloff and Dracula starring
Bela Lugosi. Other stars such as
Claude Rains and Charles Laughton
created immortal roles as the Invisi-
ble Man and the Hunchback of Notre
Dame, while Lon Chaney Jr. was
becoming ‘‘The Man of 1,000 Faces.”’

The 40’s and 50’s brought King
Kong, Godzilla, Megalon, and the
Shrimp who ate Japan, but as each
monster was sent to the cardboard,
rubber cemented Tokyo model in the
sky, horror movies lost more and
more of their ‘“‘artistic’’ elements and
became vehicles for gore and
violence in the 70’s and 80’s.

But hey, you've got to change with
the times, right? Well, technically,
and financially, the unfortunate
answer is yes. Everyone wants to
know why there have been six Friday
the 13th movies. Answer: the
original was made for roughly
$170,000, and as of last year, had
grossed over $17 million. It’s basic
math—you figure it out.

Enough griping though. The truth
of the matter is that nine of the top
ten monster/scary/horror films of all
time have come since 1973. Some are
gross, many are disgusting, most are

Ragin’ at the Girls’ Schools - What a Rush

By Marshall Boswell
and Richard Moore
Staff Reporters

 

Yes, there are women now at
Washington & Lee, and the world did
not end; and by the look of the crowds
at the Co-op this year, it seems to me
that the overwhelming majority of
men on this campus (of which I con-
sider myself a member) are perfect-
ly happy with the arrangement. But
guys (and this article is, admittedly,
primarily for the men), let us not
forget that there are also women’s
colleges—no less than five—
surrounding our little idyllic
academic community here. And
where there are women’s colleges,
there are Security Guards. And
where there are Security Guards,
there is fun to be had!

If you are wondering what I am
talking about, then you are obviously
new to W&L, and, consequently, the
women’s colleges as well. That is to
say, you have never participated in
that hallowed W&L tradition (which,
thankfully, still persists) known as
Dorm Raging.

Ah yes. Tell me, is there a more
frothy blend of euphoria and fear
than that produced by running
gleefully across the Hollins College
quad at 1:30 in the morning with a
Security Guard in hot pursuit? Sure-
ly not. Dorm Raging is NOT an art,
though; rather, it is a sport, and
since all sports have guidelines, ob-
jectives, rules and equipment, I think
it is high time those pertinent to
Dorm Raging were put down in print
once and for all.

thrilling. All are excellent.
without further ado, here are the
Tug’s Tag, Top Ten Horror films of
all time.

10. Frankenstein (1931, Dir. James
Whale)

Even though Frankenstein is not
that scary by today’s standards, it
has to make the list because of its in-
fluence on the horror genre. Boris
Karloff’s performance still ranks as
one of the finest in horror, and is no
question the finest performance of
the Frankenstein character to date.
Frankenstein is a classic and a perfect
example of what monster movies us-
ed to be. It’s just a good flick.

9. The Shining (1980, Dir. Stanley
Kubrick)

It’s good that The Shining can be in-
cluded because it kills two birds with
one stone. Stephen King and Stanley
Kubrick are both masters of what
they do. King makes a living out of
horrifying people with his novels,
while Kubrick shocks people with his
creations on film. The Shining brings
them together and the result is terri-
fying. Jack Nicholson is wonderful
as always as the hotel keeper gone
bananas. His ‘“‘Heeerrre’s Johnny”
scene with Shelley Duvall will
forever be a horror classic.

8. The Omen (1976, Dir. Richard
Donner)

The Omen was terrifying because
of the subject it dealt with. Come on,
the anti-christ is nothing to joke
about. And how about the name of
the kid; Damien? What? Did his
parents not like him or something.
Even today, how many people have
you met named Damien that you
didn’t raise your eyebrow at? That’s
what I thought. The feverish, roller
coaster intensity in the film is ex-
celient. The scene on the tricycle is a
horror classic.

7. Psycho (1960, Dir. Alfred Hit-
cheock)

What can be said about Psycho. It’s

Every true Rager’s raison d’etre,
his reason for existence, is the
Security Guard (known from here on
out as the S.G.). The objectives to
Raging, then, are two-fold: the
Rager must first get the attention of
an S.G.; next he must induce the S.G.
into pursuit; and lastly, he must
escape the S.G. in whatever legal
manner the Rager sees fit.

Now we must examine the proper
Raging attitude and costume.

As for attitude, spontaneity is the
key. The fun of Raging consists in
large part to following the Indiana
Jones maxim (a great Rager in his
own right, by the way) of, ‘‘I’m mak-
ing this up as I go along.’”’ There is
frequently no time to pre-plan where
one is going to run to, and so it is im-
perative that one be able to make the
most of whatever comes one’s way
(ie. bushes, fire-escapes, fences,
creeks, fire extinguishers, etc.). It
goes without saying that a pleasant
alcohol-induced buzz helps this
along, but be sure not to drink so as to
hinder Escape Ability (known
heretofore as one’s E.A.).

But what does one wear?

Well, running shoes are para-
mount. Loafers and top-siders might
look nice, but they are definitely ar
E.A. liability. Comfortable, loose fit-
ting pants are also important, as
one does not want to wear clothes
that might collect water or hinder
one’s ability to scale fire-escapes
three steps at a time (an indispen-
sable Raging skill). Sunglasses aid
in concealing identity, particularly
when one encounters an S.G. from a
previous night’s Raging. And lastly,

been scaring audiences for 25 years
and it will continue to as long as it is
watched. Hitchcock was the master
of suspenseful films and could turn us
inside out like no director before his
death or after. All of his films are ex-
cellent and wonderful to watch at
Halloween. Watch The Birds and see
if you don’t check the sky when you
go outside.

6. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984,
Dir. Wes Craven)

“One, Two, Freddy’s comin’ for
you.’ Though Wes Craven hasn't
made a film worth anything other
than this one, 4 Nightmare on Elm
Street is destined to become a horror
classic. There is no question that the
film succeeds due to the development
of moden special effects, but it is
still quite good and incredibly scary.
Relatively intelligent story line in
comparison to most.

5. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
(1974, Dir. Tobe Hooper)

For some reason, this film has
reached cult status among horror
fans. I wouldn’t be surprised at all in
fact, to find out that there is a
Leatherface fan club some where in
the United States. Nevertheless,
Texas Chainsaw is quite scary and will
make you cringe. Please do not
watch the meathook scene on halluci-
nogens.

4. Jaws (Dir. Steven Spielberg)

Though many people do not con-
sider this film a horror movie, it is.
In fact, Jaws is one of the best horror
movies you will ever see. If you can
find me a scarier monster than a
hungry, 2,000 pound great white
shark, let me know. Richard
Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider give ex-
cellent performances. The real
awards though, should go to the
special effects crew who made Jaws
the reality that it is on screen. Had
they not brought the shark out of the
water when Quint is killed, no one
would have ever known that the

one should always carry a wrench
(for easy sign reversal i.e. Wile E.
Coyote) and a Swiss army knife (in
case one finds oneself hungry in the
suburbs and in need of a little

vegetable-garden nourishment.

Just as sports teams have arenas
in which they prefer, for one reason
or another, to compete, so does the
true Rager have his own hierarchical
preference for womens colleges. So
let us examine the Raging Top Five.

At the top of the list is Hollins Col-
lege. Put simply, Tinker and Tinker
Creek provide a marvelous challenge
for any advanced Rager. One can
run wildly away from Tinker with a
sweating, two hundred and thirty
pound S.G. who’s chock full o’ Dunkin
Donuts, bound through the woods, in-
to or over Tinker Creek (‘‘Make it up
as you go along,” as Indiana Jones
sez) and finally onto the equestrian
course, where S.G. ditching is made
easy. Other exciting obstacles in-
clude low-lying electric cow fences,
lots of farm country, and a Kroger
shopping center (for the serious
Rager).

Second on the list is Sweet Briar.
Perhaps nothing is more satisfying to
the experienced Rager than roaring
past the occupied S.G. station with

3. Alien (1979, Dir. Ridley Scott)

“In space, no one can hear you
scream.’ Well that doesn’t work in
the theatre, does it? Many will argue
original is much more _ intense
because you don’t know what’s com-
ing. Like Jaws, the special effects
crew of Alien deserves awards and
praise. The monster they created
was not only frightening, but very
real. This film will bring you out of
your seat.

2. Halloween
Carpenter)

The other cult classic in the top ten.
John Carpenter is considered one of
the finest horror directors in the_in-
dustry today. In fact, his new film,
Prince of Darkness, could be destined
for the top ten. However,
Carpenter's tour de force is
Halloween. It is always in the top
three of all-time horror lists and
justifiably so. There are few things
scarier than a psychopathic killer
coming after you. This film is in-
credible, and were it not for one other
film, would be the scariest film ever
made.

1. The Exorcist (1973, Dir. William
Friedkin)

The Exorcist is the scariest film
ever made, no question. Ever since
its release, this film has been terrify-
ing audiences to the point that they
have turned the film off, left the
theatre, or slept with a gun under
their bed for three months. Linda
Blair’s Regan has got to be one of the
seariest individual characters to
ever appear on screen. Her Oscar-
nominated performance is excellent.
What can you say? The anti-christ is
just a terrifying subject and under
good direction, became a terrifying
film. Watch The Exorcist, but don't
watch it alone.

There they are. My choices for the
Top Ten horror films of all time.
Have a safe and Happy Halloween!

‘ Mailroom problems prompt consideration of campus post office

a

.

-*

 

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

“But the slip says to come pick up
the packages between 10:00 and 12:00
or 1:00 and 2:45, and it’s only 2:30!”

That complaint is heard often by
the wuniversity’s librarians from
angry students who have come to
pick up goodies and care packages
sent by family and friends via the
United Parcel Service.

The university mailroom is located
on the first level of the library. Many
students did not even realize that the
university has a mailroom since the
only service for students that the
mail room workers perform is handl-
ing UPS packages.

This one service has evoked many
complaints from those students who

 

use the mail room.

Students want to know why the
hours are so short and why the two
mail room employees, Charles Con-
nors and David Weeks, are some-
times not there during the hours that
the mail room is supposed to be open.

“T had not heard those com-
plaints,” said their boss, William N.
Mohler, the Director of the Universi-
ty Services, ‘I guess it hasn’t trickl-
ed down to the proper person. Now
that I have heard it, though, I will do
something about it.”’

The reason that the mail room is
probably closed is that the employees
“catch odd jobs,’’ according to
Mohler. ‘If the chairman of the
English Department calls up and
says, ‘I have to pick someone up from
the airport,’ then the mail room
employees are called.”’

 
 

Mohler continued, “I have student
drivers that I rely on, but you can’t
always rely on students because they
have class schedules and those come
first.”’

Connors, who is the Mail Room
Supervisor and who has worked at
W&L for 19 years, explained that
“‘sometimes other duties call us both
away, but most of the time we’re both
here,”’

He said, those duties include pick-
ing up mail that goes to W&L from
the Lexington post office and deliver-
ing it to the individual buildings, and
then picking up the mail from those
buildings and handling the students’
UPS packages.

Students have also complained that
the mail room is not open on Satur-
days. The mail room is open, it’s just
not open to students because UPS

a,

does not deliver on Saturdays, said
Conners.

In order to solve the problem,
Mohler said, ‘‘We are considering a
central receiving facility. If we in
fact accomplish that, the mail room
and the receiving center could be
consolidated and that would justify a
third person.”

The central receiving center would
accept items purchased by the
separate departments, such as equip-
ment for the Physical Education
Department. However, even if a
receiving center is not formed, a
third mail room worker is still being
considered.

Another reform for the mail room
being considered is to provide an on-
campus post office and post office
boxes. Assistant to the President,
Frank Parsons, said, ‘‘It’s still very
much on the table for study. We

might benefit from making the
University Center more of a place for
students to hang out.”

However, according to Parsons,
“It is not an easy problem.”’ There
are many questions to answer. What
kind of a service will the University
provide? Will it be only for intracam-
pus mail or will it be for all student
mail? “If any significant number of
students wanted to have their mail
sent to their fraternity houses, apart-
ments, or houses off campus, then
then that would not make [an on
campus post office] worthwhile,”
says Parsons.

Sophomore Gaines residents Kris
Amoroso agrees that ‘it would be
nice to have a post office on campus.
It would be a lot more convenient
because we have to be on campus
anyway.”

“It’s not that bad walking to the

post office,” admits freshman Keiko
Harada, ‘‘but it would be better if we
could just get our mail on campus.”

One problem that impedes the pro-
gress of a post office if it should prove
to be worthwhile is the lack of space
in the co-op, supply store, and book
store. The administration is con-
sidering reconstructing and enlarg-
ing the co-op. Says Parsons, “to ex-
pand that space we would have to
relocate the co-op, supply store, and
book store [to the University Center]
and that would preclude a post of-
fice.”

Parsons said he will be meeting in
the coming week with the Post
Master to discuss the campus post of-
fice and will be investigating the
possibilities over the next few mon-
ths. So an on campus post office is
still a possibility that will help to im-
prove the mail service for students.

Freshman woman is

the ‘King of the Hill’

Staff Reporter

 

 

 

By Mathew Horridge/The Ring-tum Phi
President Wilson looks over a quiz in Professor Dymacek’s calculus class.
Meanwhile, Carol Howsen decides which academic department will receive $1,000.

“She showed a lot of poise, said
Betty Brewbaker, the W&L presi-
dent’s secretary, of Carol Howsen,
winner of Sigma Nu’s “King of the
Hill’ contest.

With TV cameras and newspape1
reporters surrounding her all day,
“she did a very good job of ignoring
them,” added Frank Parsons, assis-
tant to the president.

Just what did Howsen do as Presi-
dent of W&L for a day? The Monday
schedule left her with barely enough
time to catch her breath.

Howsen’s day started with an 8:30
office orientation and ended about 5
p.m. after a faculty meeting. Though
most of the day was spent in the
president's office itself, there was
constantly something that needed to
be attended to or someone that she
had to see.

Monday was ‘“‘dean day.”’

During lunch in the dining hall,
Howsen and all the deans met and
discussed the past week and general-
ly anything that ought to be brought
to the President’s attention. All
agreed that Parents’ Weekend was
successful, but Howsen suggested
more activities should be planned for
students whose parents aren’t able to
attend.

‘Maybe there should be receptions
for the parents after dinner so they
aren’t left alone when we want to go
out with our friends,”’ she said.

“Tt was fun, but he has a tight

schedule,” said Howsen of the presi-
dent’s daily routine.

Her initial impression of the presi-
dent was that of a figurehead who
“sat around all day.”

Rather embarrassed at the admit-
tance, she added, ‘The president is
very involved in everything about the
university. He knows what's going
on.”’

For example, Howsen said that one -

of the topics of discussion was foot-
ball player Rowan Taylor and how he
would be transported back to W&L.

Taylor broke his leg in the Sewanee
football game last week and was ina
Tennessee hospital for five days.
Howsen expressed surprise that par-
ticular students came to the attention
of the administration.

“The president likes to be in
touch,”’ said Frank Parsons.

While Howsen battled the cameras
and proposals set before her in
Washington Hall, student Wilson was
attending an 8 o'clock French class.
“T had Latin in high school, Spanish
in college and I know Anglo-Saxon,
but I’m not a student of French,” he
said.

Next was Calculus.

“We discussed some new problems
in the book, but I sat in the back and
kept quiet,” Wilson said. “Using a
wine flask to discuss volume, one stu-
dent asked if you used the same for-
mula as with a beer can,” Wilson
laughed.

Raquetball gave Wilson his exer-
cise for the day.

Although he does not play regular-
ly, he held up very well, considering

Have you ever wondered how
loud a 747 would sound if it took off
within 400 feet of you? Could you
imagine what a high powered rifle
fired next to your ear would sound
like?

The answers to these questions
could be found at Twombly pool
Sunday during the Washington
and Lee—Arkansas/Little Rock
water polo game to decide the
Southern League Championship.
The crowd recorded an incredible,
ear-splitting mark of 118 decibels
during W&L’s 10-9 triumph.

The raucous, packed house
showed up not only to watch the
Generals, but to try and eclipse
the decibel mark set by the Min-
nesota Twins fans during the
World Series. True, the Min-
neapolis Metrodome is far larger

 

Earl Cole, an incoming W&L
freshman, went into a coma after he
was involved in an alcohol-related
automobile accident. Cole had at-
tended a summer rush party spon-
sored by Delta Tau Delta the night of
the accident,

According to Thompson, many
alcohol-related incidents may be
avoided if the drinker used better
judgment. Thompson hopes his
speech, the theme of which he said is
“drinking in moderation,” will teach
freshmen to drink responsibly.

“This is something that needs to be
done. I think that I have a lot to teach
[the pledges],’’ he said.

than Twombly pool, but the Twins
had 55,000-plus screaming fans,
while W&L had about 300.

The large crowd helped add ex-
citement to an already tense
matchup. Junior Moose Herring
said, “The crowd was extremely
loud. Their support meant a whole
lot to us. The crowd created the
excitement we needed in the
game.”

The noise of the crowd began to
swell with the arrival of the
Poloheads a few minutes before
gametime. The Poloheads were a
group of five freshmen who
painted their faces blue and white
and wore cut up polo balls on their
heads. They sat on the deck across
from the stands with the Gen-
eral’s reserve players and began
to cheer wildly

The intesity of the noise level
brought about some interesting
developments:

Thompson mentioned the Virginia
DUI laws and the true effects of
alcohol, particularly grain alcohol,
on an individual as two topics about
which many students are not very
knowledgeable. He said his lecture
will deal with these topics “‘in light of
our situation here at W&L.”’

Thompson said a main focus of his
speech will be drinking and driving
and what fraternity members,
pledges as well as brothers, can do to
look out for each other. He said that if
an individual knows that he will be
drinking, he should give his keys toa

¢ The officials had to ask
members of the crowd to stop
banging chairs against the pool
deck because the players could
not hear the whistle.

¢ The officials had to leave the
pool area to discuss a controver-
sial penalty shot.

These little incidents did
nothing to deter the players en-
thusiasm for the vocal crowd.
Junior David Dietz said, ‘‘They
{the crowd] were unbelievably
loud. The crowd was tremen-
dous.”’

Freshman Tomas Perez added,

nity brothers which state that when
drunk, the signee will not drive.

“If you’re in a fraternity and it’s
really a brotherhood, you should
want to help each other out,’’ Thomp-
son said.

“The pledges owe it to themselves
to take care of each other.”’

In speaking to this year’s freshman
class, Thompson hopes to avoid
possible alcohol-related mistakes in
the future. He thinks the house-
hopping method of Rush at W&L,
where rushees are encouraged to
visit several different fraternities in
one night, is conducive to alcohol
abuse. He hopes his speech will make

 

this year’s freshmen more aware of
the problem and, in turn, teach them
how to treat next year’s freshmen.

Thompson said that aside from in-
forming the freshmen, he hopes the
lectures will shed a better light on his
fraternity.

“T want to show the community
that Deltas are responsible,”’ he said.

He said the lecture was his idea
and, after visiting the Buena Vista
Alcohol Safety Awareness Program
and the Buena Vista Alchohol and
Drug Services for information, he
presented his idea to the school’s In-
terfraternity Council.

“I was playing against a 20-year-
old,” he said. But, he added amusing-
ly, ‘I was tired!’’ An insight into the
trials of a student's day, perhaps?

Meanwhile, back in the president's
office, Howsen expressed her ex-
haustion as well. The day was begin-
ning to take its toll on the freshman
from Gulf Springs, Pa., as she had
one half-hour to decide which of 20
academic departments. would get
$1000. The English and Math depart-
ments were Howsen’s choices. She
based her decision on which would
benefit the most students at the
university.

Howsen said the administration
was very cooperative. ‘They really
took it seriously and were very in-
terested in what I thought. They
wanted to hear what I had to say,”

If a problem came to her attention
through one of the deans, she gave it
careful thought. Her most repeated
recommendation was ‘‘ask the
students what they think.”’

Howsen expressed the need for
more communication directly be-
tween students and the administra-
tion and more university-sponsored
activities to promote class unity.

She said, ‘They [the administra-
tion] really want to know what we
think, but they have a hard time get-
ting in touch with us.”’

It’s not an easy job, Howsen con-
cluded.

“T would not want to be the presi-
dent at this point,’’ though she said
she would do it again. ‘‘I just bought
a ticket—No. 1,’ she laughed, “‘I
didn’t know what it was all about.”’

accident

Leroy C. “Buddy’’ Atkins, the
Dean of Fraternity Affairs, said that
Thompson’s lecture ‘‘sounds like a
good program.”’ He especially liked
the idea of a student-to-student

speech.

“T think [the speech] will be a lot
more effective coming from a stu-
dent than from an old-timer like
me,”’ Atkins said.

Thompson agreed with Atkins.

“Coming from a peer as opposed to
a superior, things will be taken more
seriously,’ he said

OPINION
Deferred

Arecent petition advocating a winter Rush for the fraterni-
ty system received support from over 100 faculty members.
Although we are sure that those who signed the petition have
good intentions, we want to point out some of the dangers of a
winter Rush.

The fraternities will be hurt financially immediately. For
the entire first term they will have no income from freshmen
pledges. This problem would hit the smaller houses excep-
tionally hard. With fewer members at the outset they may
not have enough money to function.

The financial problem would be multiplied by forcing the
fraternities to conduct an informal Rush for at least 12 weeks
before the formal winter Rush started. In an effort to let
freshmen know the houses are socially active, fraternities
will be inclined to throw more parties throughout the fall
term. Therefore, a university sponsored winter Rush not only
hurts the fraternity system financially, it forces the system
into more of a “‘party animal’’ atmosphere.

Do freshmen really want to be subjected to 12 weeks of
fraternity men hounding them to join a particular house
when winter comes along? Freshmen will constantly be ask-
ed by fraternities to join them for dinners, road trips, movies,
anything to get them with fraternity members.

Some may say that the answer to that is having no-contact
rules stretching over the entire term. That would not only be
worthless, it would deprive freshmen of the chance to
become friends with upperclassmen. Remember, one of the
best aspects of college is the opportunity to grow by meeting
new people. To forbid the freshmen from socializing with cer-
tain people is unfair to both them and the fraternities.

A winter Rush would also force the fraternities to function
primarily with three classes instead of four. Since most
fraternities now do not initiate pledges until winter term, a
winter Rush would delay initiation until spring term at the
earliest. This keeps freshmen from actively participating in
many house functions which would keep them from learning
how the house is run. As a result, it would be harder for the
house to cultivate its own leaders in the future.

If freshmen live without fraternities, many will decide that
there is no need for them to join any social organization. With
the construction of Gaines residence hall it is obvious that the
fraternities are no longer necessary for student housing. The
traditional openess of the fraternity system to independents
will also encourage more freshmen not to pledge a house.

It may strike some people as a brazen ‘‘fraternities are just
a business” point-of-view to denounce the fact winter Rush
will lower the number of freshmen willing to join fraternities.
However, it is actually a point of survival for many frater-
nities, particularly the smaller houses.

The fraternity system does need work to make itself better,
but forming a Rush calender that discourages men from join-
ing houses does not help the system. It will in fact hurt the
system by possibly causing the demise of one or more houses.

The administration has pledged its support of a strong
fraternity system at W&L. However, it will not be showing its
support if a winter Rush is begun. There are many other
ways that the two-week Rush at the beginning of the fall term
can be modified so that students are able to concentrate on
classes, and the fraternity system is able to function at a high
level.

The Interfraternity Council should first clean up the no-
contact rules. Rush sign-up turned into a fiasco this year
because fraternities were not supposed to contact freshmen
before the freshmen decided what houses they were going to
rush. Making freshmen blindly sign up for open house dates
is just plain silly. A number of large universities with over
twenty fraternities require rushees to go through every
house. W&L has only 17 fraternities; the IFC should be able
to design a similar plan.

The IFC also needs to work on the punishments houses
receive for Rush violations. Giving houses fines and social
probation does not do anything to stop the problem, especial-
ly this part year when most houses had budgeted for a four-
week Rush and had money left over.

On the first violation a house should receive a fine of $1,000.
This way each house is cushioned in case one over-zealous
brother violates a Rush rule. However, on the second offense
a fraternity should immediately be limited in the number of
pledges it can have for the coming year. On a third offense,
the fraternity should lose its pledge class and Rush privileges
for the rest of the year.

This punishment system would make dirty Rush unfeasible
for the fraternities if it were properly enforced. Since the
members of the IFC agree to follow the rules set forth, one
would think it would be a matter of honor that the rules be
followed at a school with such a respected Honor System. The
fraternities should not be afraid of the punishments; if they
follow the rules, they will have nothing to fear.

We would like to invite members of the faculty and ad-
ministration to write to The Ring-tum Phi and express their
opinions on a deferred rush. Only through open debate can
the best solution for rush problems be found.

What presents will the lottery bring?

 

MY VIEW
By Margaret Pimblett

 

Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus, but his name is not St. Nick.

Instead, his name is The Lottery,
and in Tuesday’s election, Virginia
voters approved a state-wide ref-
erendum to initiate a state-run lot-
tery.

So now that the lottery has been ap-
proved by the public, how will it all
be administered? Well, a brand-new
state agency will have to be in-
stituted, so although the lottery will
technically begin on Dec. 1, it won't
actually start operations for several
months. You'll have to wait awhile to
begin purchasing tickets and hoping
for that chance to become a multi-
millionaire overnight.

I haven't decided yet whether or
not I'll play the lottery. As a resident
of Newport News, in southeastern

Virginia, I’ve never played the
Maryland or Washington D.C. lot-
teries. Unlike the voters of Northern
Virginia, I haven’t personally seen
the Virginia money which is spent on
out-of-state lotteries. Those voters
must have really wanted to keep the
Virginians’ dollars in Virginia's
hands; the voters in the eighth and
tenth Congressional districts, in Nor-
thern Virginia, voted for the lottery,
38,051 votes to 23,779.

The lottery’s main bastions of sup-
port were the more populated areas
of the state. The third district, which
encompasses Richmond, Henrico
County and part of Chesterfield
County, affirmed the lottery, 69,115 to
38,821. Norfolk and Virginia Beach in
the fourth district voted overwhelm-
ingly in favor of the lottery; the vote
there was 74,306 in favor to 47,810
against.

On the other hand, the fifth, sixth
and ninth districts were the only ones
out of the ten Virginia districts to op-
pose the lottery in the tally. Those

three districts include the far
southwestern counties, the Shenan-
doah Valley from Augusta County
south, and the Southside and Pied-
mont regions south of Fluvanna
County to the North Carolina line.

A portion of the sixth district result
came from Jocal voter turnout. In
Rockbridge County, Lexington and
Buena Vista combined, voters oppos-
ed the lottery referendum 3,893 to
3,548.

Geographically, the fifth, sixth and
ninth districts account for nearly half
of Virginia’s land mass. But the
centers of population are east and
north of those districts, so the three
compatriots found themselves out-
voted.

That’s how many analysts had
predicted the race would develop.
The areas with the higher popula-
tions would favor the lottery so that
residents would not have to endure
higher taxes within their localities,
or see Virginia funds bleeding over
into neighboring states.

The rural districts were expected
to oppose the lottery from both a
moral and fiscal standpoint. As Gov.
Gerald Baliles had said shortly
before Election Day, there are more
dependable methods of increasing
revenue than the lottery.

Baliles was also concerned about
how the revenue generated by the lot-
tery will be allocated. Many lottery
supporters had suggested that funds
be given for improving education,
care of the elderly and clean-up of the
Chesapeake Bay. But the lottery
referendum did not specify what pro-
grams the money will benefit.

Neither did the referendum explain
what format the lottery will adopt.

Despite the margin of victory for
the state-wide lottery referendum,
with so many questions still to be
answered about the administration of
the gaming system, I wonder
whether the lottery Santa Claus may
leave a lump of coal in Virginia’s
stocking, instead of the lump of gold
which many voters seem to expect.

Upset mother ruins freshman’s weekend

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

Parents’ weekend is portrayed as a
time for relaxed reunions and
nostalgic memories but there is
another, usually avoided side of
Parents’ Weekend, a darker side
which rarely allows ‘a student to go
the whole weekend without rearing
its ugly head. At this moment many
of you are still probably trying to
forget the painful memories of a
DISILLUSIONED MOTHER. But
alleviating the pain is not that simple
because it started in your youth.

When you were a child your mother
cleaned up your room but in your
adolescence she rebelled. Your room
gradually became dirtier, messier
and less organized while you ignored
all pleas to have it cleaned up. Even-
tually your mother became angry
and the anger manifested itself in the
form of, ‘‘all right, all right don’t
clean up your room. See if I care!”’

You answered by promptly moving
things around to give your room the
appearance of cleanliness. This
satisfied mom decided you were a
real gentleman or lady and deserved
to attend a respectable institution
like Washington and Lee. She also
made the mistake of assuming that
you really wanted to live in a clean
environment when, in truth, you only
did it to make her happy and simul-
taneously to get her off your back.
Everything went fine until Parents’
Weekend.

The second she saw your dorm
room her blood pressure increased
and she started to sweat as her worst
nightmare came to life—the realiza-
tion that you are a slob. Your father,
-on the other hand, who always knew
you for the slob you are, finds the
whole situation very humorous and

cracks bad jokes for three days ad-
ding insult to your mother’s injury.

My parents first went to my dorm
room while I was at class and when I
returned only my father was there,
laughing so uncontrollably that he
could not even tell me where my
mother went.

Later I learned that she had con-
tacted the appropriate goverment of-
ficials in order to have my birth an-
nuled. Thankfully, these officials told
her it was impossible, leaving her the
simple option of cleaning it up her-
self.

To the Editors:

very much.

 

The fans are what make an athletic event, or a
chorus recital for that matter, exciting and
rewarding, especially for the players and per-
formers. The fans are even more important at a
Division III school like ours. Not only do they
make the games more exciting, but their sports-
manship also increases the prestige of our pro-

We are excited by the support shown by the
fans of W&L sports, and we hope that their spirit
will continue. Surely the fans realize that they
not only reward the players with their presence,
but also themselves. And for those of you who
missed the polo game, check the Cable Nine
listing during the next couple of weeks, as it will
be aired at least once. Once again, thank you

Naturally, I was asked to help but
it soon became obvious that I lacked
the ability since I had learned from
youth only how to move things
around. My dad tried to help but
could not stop laughing.

Since cleaning up my room took
two and a half days, I only had a few
hours to spend with my parents and
most of this time was spent listening
to my Dad say things like:

“No wonder you've been having
trouble sleeping, you can’t find your
bed.” (Ha Ha!)

“Cleaning up your room wasn’t so

As chairman of the Voting Regulations Board,
1 would like to thank everyone involved for mak-
ing this year’s freshmen elections such a suc-
cess. Because of everyone's efforts, over 80 per-
cent of the class voted in each of the two elec-
tions, well above my expectations and a vast im-
provement over past years when generally about
65 percent of those qualified would turn out.

The many volunteers did a fine job manning
the ballot boxes, and the members of the VRB
(all ‘‘rookies’”’) did commendable work in ad-
ministering the elections and procuring accurate
results. I would also like to thank each candidate
for his or her part in seeing the that freshmen-
voted, and the entire class of 1991 should be com-
plimented for their interest and enthusiasm.

Each facet was invaluable in attaining this
year’s results. Thanks again and keep it up.

Chicken disappears at frat party

 

a
By Robert MacPherson
Staff Reporter

 

If the SPCA gets what it wants,
barnyard animals will be banned
from all fraternity parties at W&L

Ellen Arthur, a member of the
SPCA Board of Directors and legal
counsel to the organization, said that
she will ask the Interfraternity Coun-
cil to pass a law prohibiting barnyard
animals at fraternity parties

Arthur’s plans came on the heels of
a party at the Pi Kappa Alpha social
fraternity where, according to PiKA
Social Chairman Chris Cunningham,
chickens were present.

Allegations involving mistreat-
ment of the chickens at the party and
the disappearance of one of the
chickens prompted Arthur to make
her request.

According to Arthur, an SPCA
humane investigator received two
reports of animal abuse at the PiKA
party on the Monday immediately
following the party.

Arthur said that a Sweet Briar Col-
lege student who had been at the par-
ty said that she saw two chickens tied
together and thrown around. The
other report, Arthur said, came from
a high school senior from Harrison-
burg who was considering attending
WA&L next fall.

‘He told me that he was thoroughly
turned off by W&L because of what
he saw at the party,”’ she said.

Steve Roth, a W&L senior and vice-
president of PiKA, said that the frat-
crnity had rented four chickens from
an area farmer for use in the ‘“Ja-
maican Room”’ of an ‘‘Around the
World” party. He said chickens had

been used at previous ‘‘Around the
World” parties without any pro-
blems.

Arthur said that according to the
farmer, only three of the four
chickens were returned.

Roth said that he was not responsi-
ble for returning the chickens and,
consequently, did not know how
many had been returned. He did say
that the fraternity will not use
chickens at future parties.

“T think [an IFC ban on animals at
parties ]is a good idea,”’ he said.

Arthur said that the SPCA will not
press criminal charges even though '
she said the fraternity broke the law. ,

“It is a violation of a city ordinance
to have barnyard animals within the :
city limits. We could bring criminal
charges against them but we're not '
going to,’’ she said.

Wilson amuses W&L parents

 

By Ann Stewart
Staff Reporter

 

President John D. Wilson made his
annual address to parents Saturday
in Lee Chapel prior to the football
game.

Opening remarks were made by
Dean Lewis John, who was a student
here when Parent’s Weekend
became a tradition in 1955

The speech was Wilson’s fourth to

parents since taking office in
January 1983.
Wilson’s speech was largely

directed towards the parents of the
freshman class and was humorous in
tone.

The parents were told the average
mid-term grades, 2.51, were the
highest since 1973. Before then, the
average was not recorded.

The president referred to the con-
struction problems with Gaines Hall
as ‘Wilson’s Folly.’’ The completion
date has now been moved to Christ-
mas.

He also announced that, although

the university had lost money in the
recent Wall Street plunge, W&L is
financially stable.

He mentioned the increased reten-
tion rate of students, bringing in forty
students more than the ceiling of
1,500. This should be corrected by
next year, he said.

On the positive side, Wilson seem-
ed enthusiastic about the raffle
Sigma Nu held for his job.

Wilson announced that he would
give the winner $1,000 out of the
Presidential Discretionary Fund to
spend on academic aid for the
University. He asked each in-
dividual department to submit a re-
quest for the money so the student
would experience the difficulty of a
college president’s having to say
“No.”

Wilson informed the parents of his
plans to strengthen the school, nam-
ing the project for a new theater, the
new computer center in the Com-
merce School and recent grants sub-

mitted for advancement in the '
sciences and a possible Russia--
Asian studies major.

To close his speech, Wilson cited
US News and World Report’s poll of
college presidents which ranked
W&L in the top 25 national liberal
arts colleges.

Wilson also issued a plea for the
parents’ younger children to consider
W&L.

The parents of freshman Lynette
Goodman enjoyed hearing the presi-
dent speak. David Goodman liked
“hearing about the present activities
and the future of the university.”
Barbara Goodman found ‘‘the presi-
dent’s attitude toward the students
comforting.’’

Pete Reynolds of Philadelphia,
father of sophomore’ Becky
Reynolds, thought the content of the
speech was pretty much the same as
last year, but felt Wilson’s delivery
was not quite as good.

Katherine Reynolds appreciated
Wilson’s concern with strengthening
the performing arts at W&L.

Water polo wins league tourney

 

By Hunter Catlett
_ staff Reporter

 

The W&L water polo team won the
Southern League championship Sun-
day before a Twombly pool crowd,
. estimated at over 300 people, which
made so much noise that it put the
Minnesota Twins’ fans to shame.

The 19th-ranked Generals, 23-4 on
the season, beat the University of
. Arkansas/Little Rock Trojans 10-9 as
junior David Dietz pumped in six
goals and the crowd noise reached
118 decibels. The Metrodome crowd
in Minneapolis only hit an estimated
115 decibels during the World Series.
. The final was also the rubber

match between the two teams this
_ year. Arkansas won round one of the
.. Southern League tournament 13-11,

while W&L won round two 12-9.

_. The game started out as a defen-
sive war as neither team was able to
score in the first five-and-a-half
' minutes of play. Arkansas broke the
scoring drought by connecting with
just 1:12 left in the period. Fifteen
seconds later Dietz scored on a
beautiful backhand shot to knot the
game at 1-1. That’s the way the
period ended as the Generals held
Arkansas to just three shots.

Period number two was a wild and
_ wooly affair. Junior Matthew Brady
started the scoring with a goal just
:50 seconds into the stanza. Dietz
_ made it 3-1 Generals with 5:32 re-
. maining by connecting from the left

point. The Trojans bounced back
behind Martin Nilsson who scored
with 4:55 remaining to bring Arkan-
sas to within 3-2. Thirty-three

seconds later junior Thomas Rawls
made the first of his many great
saves to maintain W&L’s advantage.
With 3:54 left, Dietz scored on his sec-
ond backhand goal to give W&L a 4-2
lead. The Generals were then unable
to convert on three shots on goal
despite having a man advantage, and
were in turn scored upon just scant
moments after the teams were at
even strength. Dietz then crunched
the back of the goal for his fourth
score, despite having a man hanging
all over him, to give W&L a 5-3 edge
with 1:39 remaining. Rawls made
another brilliant save with just :01
left and it appeared as if the Generals
would have a two-goal margin at the
half. That was not the case as the
Generals got careless on the in-
bounds play and let Nilsson score,
bringing the Trojans to within one,
5-4.

Senior Simon Perez started the
Generals scoring in the third, giving
the Generals a 6-4 lead with 5:05 to go
in the period. The Trojans then found
Nilsson all alone again and he scored
to cut the deficit to one, 6-5. Dietz
followed by finding the mark from
the corner to give W&L a 7-5 lead
with just over 3:30 to play. Martin’s
older brother, Ulf Nilsson, got in the
scoring act with a backhand shot to
bring Arkansas to within 7-6. Junior
David Reavy scored with a man ad-
vantage and the Generals lead was
again two with just over two minutes
to play. After Reavy’s goal, Rawls
made yet another save on a break-
away to keep W&L’s lead to two, 8-6.
The two teams traded goals within a
:20 span and the third period ended
with W&L up 9-7.

Football drops 4th

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L football Generals record-
ed their fourth loss in as many games
Saturday, falling this time to the
Bridgewater College Eagles, 21-7,
but head coach Gary Fallon said he
was pleased with his team’s effort
and is optimistic about this
weekend’s game against Ursinus.

“When you come out of a defeat,
the first thing you look-at in the films
is the effort and the intensity, and we

had both;said Fallon.

In fact, if not for a few dropped
balls and overthrown passes, W&L
could very easily have pulled out a
win before the Parents’ Weekend
crowd of over 4,000.

The Generals scored their first and
only touchdown of the game with 5:42
remaining in the first quarter on a 19-
yard carry by freshman Car] Gilbert.
His classmate, kicker Carter Quayle,
added the extra point to give W&L a
7-0 lead.

But, from then on, the scoring was
all Bridgewater. After an Eagle punt,
the Generals drove to the BC 36,
where senior spilt end John Roe drop-
ped a fourth-down pass from soph-
omore quarterback Phil Sampson
that would have given the Generals a
first down, The Eagles took over and
drove 64 yards in six plays, scoring
on a nine-yard run by sophomore
tailback Anthony Lawrence. Lex-
ington’s own Jake Darrell added the

It wasn’t quite a blowout this time
around. Let’s just call it a landslide.

The W&L men’s cross country
team dominated its opposition once
again, defeating Eastern Mennonite
and Hampden-Sydney by wide
margins on the General’s home
course on Saturday. W&L raised its
record to 7-2, scoring a mere 18 points
to E-M’s 56 and H-S’s 61.

The meet may be a preview of the
future as the Generals travel to
Bridgewater this Saturday to com-
pete in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championships. Both
E-M and H-S are members of the

extra point to tie the score at seven.

In the third quarter, the Generals
received the opening kickoff and
drove 24 yards to their own 45, where
a bad snap on fourth down gave the
Eagles the football at the W&L 31.
Bridgewater scored 10 plays later on
a Lawrence carry up the middle from
14 yards out. Darrell’s extra point
gave the Eagles the lead, 14-7, a lead
they would never relinquish.

After a Sampson interception and
an exchange of punts, Lawrence dove
into the end zone from two yards out.
The Bridgewater tailback fumbled as
he broke the plane, but Bagle guard
Bryan Moser recovered for the final
touchdown of the afternoon. Darrell’s
kick made the score 21-7 with 12:46
remaining in the fourth quarter.

The Generals had three oppor-
tunities to rally in the fourth quarter,
but those drives ended on two Skeen
punts and a Sampson interception.
The Bridgewater defensive line had
caused problems for W&L through-
out the game, especially in the se-
cond half, repeatedly pressuring
Sampson and forcing him to either be
sacked or throw away the football.

‘Anytime a team has the lead, they
can really take off,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘I
don’t think our kids were tired as
much as they were expecting the
pass and coming after us.”’

The loss left the Generals at 2-5,
with a 1-4 record in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. Bridgewater is
now 3-5, witha 1-3 ODAC record.

Things started slowly for the
Generals as they failed to score on
two different occasions with a man
advantage in the first two minutes of
the fourth period. Nilsson scored the
last of his team-high four goals to pull
the Trojans to within 9-8 with just
over four minutes remaining. Less
than a minute later, junior Martin
Burlingame stole the ball from the
Arkansas goalie and found Dietz for
his, and the team’s, final goal mak-
ing it 10-8 Generals with 3:35 left.
Fourteen seconds later it appeared
as if Rawls had just made a phe-
nomenal save of an Arkansas penalty
shot—only to have the officials leave
the pool area for a conference and
come back to award the goal to the
Trojans making the score 10-9.

At the 42-second mark, Burlingame
missed a lob shot to give Arkansas a
last chance for a tie. The situation
began to look grim when, with :27
left, Dietz was ejected. With one sec-
ond left Arkansas began an inbounds
play and appeared to tie the game,
but, the officials ruled that the time
had expired before the shot was
taken. The game, and the Southern
League championship, belonged to
the Generals.

While discussing the low scoring
first and fourth periods head coach,
and Southern League Coach-of-the-
Year, Paige Remillard said, ‘‘In the
first period everyone was getting ad-
justed and there were a lot of turn-
overs. The teams settled down in the
second and third periods only to have
fatigue set in during the fourth.
That’s where we returned to the
fundamentals.”

Rawls simply sparkled in the

“It was pretty easy,’’ said head
coach Dick Miller on Saturday’s vic-
tories, ‘in the sense that neither one
of those teams was very strong right
now. I was a little surprised. I
thought Hampden-Sydney would do
better than they did.’

The Generals were once again led
by senior co-captain Scott Rippeon,
who won the race in a time of 28:12
over the 8-kilometer course and
junior Bill Clark (2nd, 28:28), who
was not far behind. The Generals
then closed out the meet when the
Gang of Three, seniors Richard
Moore and Rick Norris and freshman
Larry Pilkey, all finished within 21
seconds of one another and grabbed
the 4th through 6th places.

The Generals will get all they can
handle from Roanoke this weekend.
The Maroons, from most speculation,
will be the team to beat at the cham-
pionships.

“Roanoke is obviously the
favorite,’’ said Rippeon. ‘‘They’ve
beaten every team in the ODAC at
least once, I believe. Essentially, we
are the underdogs going in. Really,
nobody expects anybody but Roa-
noke to win.”’

Miller agreed. “I don’t know of
anyone who is going to beat
[Roanoke]”’ he said. ‘“‘They have four
good men and | think all the rest of us
are running for second place.”

The General's biggest competition
for second place will be Lynchburg, a
team W&L did not race against dur-
ing the regular season. Lynchburg,
like the Generals, were beaten badly
by Roanoke.

Women harriers split

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

For the W&L women’s cross coun-
try team, last Saturday’s perfor-
mance may be an prelude for this
Saturday’s Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championships.

The Generals, 3-3 on the season,
finished second in a tri-meet with
Eastern Mennonite and Lynchburg
on W&L’s home course. E-M won the
meet with 28 points, followed by W&L
with 42 and Lynchburg with 54. The
meet, however, gives a good idea as
to how the Generals will fare in the
championships. Both E-M and
Lynchburg are ODAC schools.

“T thought they ran well,” said
men’s head coach Dick Miller.
“Eastern Mennonite is a pretty well
established team.”’

Freshman Paige Cason passed
E-M’s Taurara Hunsberger in the
final 400 meters to finish first in a
time of 23:59 over the 5-kilometer

course. Hunsberger, according to
Miller, is one of the top runners in the
ODAC this season. Cason received
support from freshmen Sean Wert
(5th, 26:15), Margaret Boyd (11th,
28:29), Pat Lopes (12th, 29:00) and
sophomore Wendy Wilson (13th,
29:54).

“Paige did beat who I suspect is
the No. 1 runner in the conference,”
said Miller. ‘Although, you have to
recognize the fact that she had a little
heat exhaustion and Paige really
didn’t pass her until she got down on
the law school lawn. But Paige is run
ning strong.”’ ‘

Miller sees the ODAC champion
ships as Eastern Mennonite’s meet to
win, but he is optimistic that the
Generals will be able to improve on
the previous season’s third-place
finish.

The women’s championship race
will be held at 11:00 a.m. at
Bridgewater College with the men’s
race to follow at 12:00 p.m.

Soccer finishes on ‘upswing’

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team closed out its 1987 season
this past week with two victories over
Millersville and Averett. The Gen-
eral’s final overall record stands at
an even .500, 7-7, and the team had a
3-2 Old Dominion Athletic Conference
mark.

Last Saturday for Parent’s
Weekend, the Generals took
Millersville apart at the seams.
Sophomore goalie Jack Pringle got
his third shutout of the season while
the Generals’ offense made the rest
look easy.

Junior Jamie Urso came away
with a couple of goals, and

sophomore Jeff Caggiano and senior
John Coll each put one in as well. One
goal was credited to the unhappy
Millersville player who, in an at
tempt to give the ball back to his
goalie, put W&L on the scoreboard
once again. The final score was 5-0.

On Monday, the Generals traveled
to Averett College to add yet another
shutout onto Pringle’s list. W&L
scored all of its own goals this time.
The 3-0 victory enabled the Genera!s
to reach the coveted .500 level.

The season was disappointing com
pared to last year when the team took
the ODAC championship, but after
riding through periods of very rocky
water, the season concluded with a
strong upswing.

A night of campfires in Lee Chapel

We may as well have been sitting
sund a campfire on a cool autumn
sht in Aspen, cuddled together,

ughts wander

the stage, and we sit in the pews,
light dusk, staring into the empty
ation, whispering occasional-

We are all pleased to see them, the
.o familiar faces that are so much a
rt of the library of memories from
r years at W&L. Tonight they have
ne back to the birthplace of their
sical career to mark the next slab
stone on their path, their second
yum. And to share it with an in-
nate audience

‘es the first clean twang of a string

daze. As if our minds are in limbo.
he blankness is a transition period
that the mind and the imagination ex-
perience, a move between thinking
bout the demands of the world, to a
ate of letting two acoustical guitars
and two soft voices guide one’s
oughts,
Roger joins in with the rich tones of
his guitar, and suddenly my mind

begins to wander. The words in their
song are describing a girl named
Jenny who “makes my head a little
lighter and my day a little brighter,”
and I receive this clear picture of
her. Then my mind moves to another
Jenny, a tall silent type who makes
my head light.

I look around the chapel, and so
many eyes are in a daze. They have a
Jenny on their minds too, someone
who makes their own day a little
brighter.

Roger and Eric give the gift of
time, time to think and ponder, as
their music can take the mind on a
grand tour of what it contains. Their
strings and descriptive words set
thoughts in motion, from the smell of
sweet magnolias, a smile or a kiss
from someone special, to traveling a
highway or sitting outside on the
porch in the evening.

They tap our feelings on relation-
ships, putting romance’s complex-
ities into words we understand like
“looking for honesty,’’ ‘‘the game,”’
being ‘‘tangled up in lies”’ or the ‘‘tor-
tures’ of the coy female.

And they translate that crazy ad-
diction that transcends practicality
as if they have been there, like driv-
ing all night on some miserable
highway to get to Alabama because,
“everything's all right when I’m with
you.”’

The roll of their guitars and the
tones of their voices make you think
of the last time you slept in until 3:00
on Saturday or the last time you
shared a bottle of screw-top wine and
a fireplace. Things their music
allows us to savor in our thoughts for
as long as we please.

They can stir up a lot of stuff that
you thought had been put away some-
where in your head, and even give

you a tight feeling in your stomach.
At times they can have the cathartic
function of a Greek tragedy, except
they do it in contemporary terms,
with an earthiness and themes we all
understand.

Over the course of a three-hour
concert, Roger and Eric allowed my

my Jenny, Mom in the garden,
memories of a friend lost in high
school, to the bristles of a horse’s
whiskers on my cheeks, fishing with
Dad and of course, many special

They create images in your mind,

silvery trout pulled from a mountain

pickup trucks, to misty mornings and
moonlit nights, to a pair of baby blue

songs ranging from their favorite
original tunes to pieces they just
completed last week, plus lots of ap-

is a bit more complex and soundy
than their original work, but it still
has the same effect.

These singers, considered by the

directors to be the finest forty singers

“The purpose of forming the ‘new’

the same time we wanted to continue
to provide an opportunity for all

Spice is currently serving his sec-

clearly has matured into a major
force on the new music scene.

In fact, the only childish things
about the album are the picture of the

what. What matters is the music in-

the local record store to buy it or
maybe even to the bookstore to

awesome.

Blue Ridge forum draws recruiters from 30 law schools

 

By David Emrich
Co-editor

 

More than one-hundred students
took advantage of the Blue Ridge
Pre-Law Forum held Monday in the
University Center, said Richard
Heatley, director of the Career
Development and Placement Office.

From 1 p.m. until 4 p.m. admis-

 

sions officers from the thirty schools
were divided alphabetically into
three rooms, with students free to
visit any or all of the rooms. The
forum was open to students from
most of the area colleges, said
Heatley.

At 4 p.m., there was a panel discus-
sion by three of the admissions of-
ficers. The three topics addressed in
the discussion were choosing the cor-
rect law school for oneself, admis-

sions procedures and the meaning
and importance of the LSAT and
grades in the admissions process,
said Heatley.

The day is designed to ‘‘provide a
convenient gathering on this campus
of a number of law schools which
students could approach and ask
their questions concerning applica-
tion to those schools,” said Heatley.

The panel discussion has a slightly
different purpose, according to
Heatley. He said that was intended to

In a recent edition of U.S. News &
World Report, W&L was ranked 25th
nationally among liberal arts col-
leges.

This rating was based on the
response of presidents of colleges all
over the United States. Of 125
presidents surveyed, 92 responded by
naming (in their opinion) the top 10
national liberal arts colleges.

With Thanksgiving approaching
rapidly, the service fraternity Alpha
Phi Omega seeks to increase
awareness of,and raise money for,

‘world hunger.

The pledges of APO are working
with an organization called OxFam
America. The OxFam organization,
according to APO pledge president
Dan Bettendorf is ‘‘a charity service
that provides funds for self-help pro-

give “a sweeping overview [by so-
meone other than himself] of how one
goes about settling on a law school,
making application to that school,
and what one’s chances of admission
would be.”’

Putting together the forum, said
Heatley, involved writing letters to
most of the major law schools in the
country and inviting them to attend.
He said that Monday’s forum
represented the largest turnout
they’ve ever had.

In 1985, W&L received an
honorable mention in the same rank-
ing. Two years previously, W&L was
ranked the number one small liberal
arts college east of the Mississippi.

According to John Elrod, Dean of
the College, “I’d rather be 25th na-
tionally than number one of small
colleges.

“We're competing with the best
liberal arts colleges in the nation,
and that’s where we belong. We're in
very good company and whenever
you’re positively associated with
good colleges it reassociates the no-

grams in under-developed countries.
It is not emergency relief.’’

The program involves all aspects
of the Lexington community.

First, members of APO will ask
students to sign their name to a list
which means that those students will
not eat in the dining hall on the even-
ing of Dec. 3.

For every meal that students
pledge not to eat, the dining hall will
give the money for that meal to the
OxFam organization.

According to Bettendorf, APO is
also trying to get the fraternities and

Heatley said he was very happy
with the forum, but added he wants to
expand the forum to include even
more schools next year.

Heatley also said he talked to the
representatives from the University
of Georgia, Duke, and Washington
and Lee law schools and they told
him they felt the day was profitable.

For the convenience of the
recruiters, Monday’s forum was
organized in conjunction with similar
forums at other schools in Virginia,

tion that we are one of the top col-
leges in the United States.”’

W&L should be considered one of
the top ten liberal arts colleges in the
nation, according to 7.6 percent of all
the presidents who responded.

Yet when comparing SAT scores,
nine of the schools in W&L’s catagory
had average scores of the same or
lower than those of W&L. Twenty
schools had a higher admittance rate
than W&L (29 percent).

“TI don’t want to over estimate
SAT’s because there are also many
also many other important factors in

other community organizations in-
volved.

“Weare hoping. that the frater-
nities show the same enthusiasm for
OxFam as they do for other fund-
raising activities.”’

He further added, “The program is
not limited to the campus. We are in-
volving community churches and
other Lexington organizations in
hopes to make it a community wide
effort.”’

Bettendorf has little idea how
much money the project will bring to
OxFam. When asked about potential
goals, he said, ‘‘The money itself is

according to Heatley.

“For example, [on Wednesday the
recruiters were] at William and
Mary, so they were able to put these
back to back and make a very good
sweep of Virginia schools,” said
Heatley.

According to Heatley, next year’s
forum in scheduled in exactly the
same manner. It will be heldon Mon-
day, Nov. 7, 1988, with William and
Mary’s forum on the following
Wednesday.

W&L reappears in survey;
ranked 25th nationally

the admissions process,’’ stated
Elrod, ‘‘but pay attention to the fact
that we have much higher SAT
scores and a lower admittance rate
than many schools ranked above us.

“Our quality of education is actually
much better than it is perceived to
be. We are experiencing an increase
in student quality and it will take a
while for W&L’s perceptions to catch
up with actuality.

‘“We are providing our students with

a good solid liberal arts education
which is the best preparation for a
career— that’s our strength.”

Alpha Phi Omega sponsors fast for hungry

secondary. It is difficult to assess
how much money we can really
raise, being the first year of Ox-
Fam.”

‘‘What is so often misunderstood,”’
he added, ‘‘is the idea that we are
simply trying to accrue funds to fight
world hunger. That is true, but more
importantly we are trying to bring
awareness of world hunger into this
community.”

The date for the OxFam project is
Dec. 3, and should any groups or
organizations wish to become involv-
ed, they can call Bettendorf at
463-2395.

W&L actors and musicians to have new Pettit, arts center

 

By J.C. Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

As a liberal arts college, W&L has
done without an adequate perform-
ing area for drama and choral pro-
ductions for way too long, according
to school officials.

In order to accommodate the needs
of the university, W&L will build a
Performing Arts Center to house the
drama department, which will also
provide a performing area for
musical events, said officials.

“The primary purpose of the
building is to be a teaching theater,”
said Frank Parsons, executive assis-
tant to the president.

Parsons said that W&L has
outgrown the Troubadour Theater,
and a larger performing area was
necessary.

The new center will cost an
estimated $9 million, and construc-
tion is scheduled to begin in the spr-
ing of 1988, said Farris Hotchkiss,
vice-president of university relations
and secretary of the board of
trustees,

“This is the university’s longest un-
met need. We have known that we
needed a theater for as long as we
have needed major improvement,”’
said Hotchkiss.

Albert Gordon, professor of fine
arts, agreed that the new center has
been long overdue, but is very ex-
cited about it all.

“T just wish they would hurry up,”
he said.

A general concern among W&L of-
ficials is that students believe the
center is being built only for the
drama department and they want to
let students know that is not the case.

Parsons and Gordon agree that the
center will not only meet the needs of
the drama department, but will
enrich Rockbridge County as well as
benefit the entire W&L community.

“T hope the people on the campus
realize it is something the whole
campus needs and it is not just for
us,” said Gordon.

Hotchkiss said the fund-raising ef-
forts are going well and he has high
hopes of beginning construction in
the spring.

“But in fundraising, you are never
sure of what you can or cannot do,”’
he added.

He said over a period of 1' years
approximately $4 million of the total
project cost of $9 million has been
pledged.

Hotchkiss believes the recent stock
market crash scared people, but it
has not directly effected the cam-
paign.

The 425-seat facility will be located
diagonally across from Gaines
Residence Hall off of Nelson Street.

The Troubadour Theater and the
Boiler Room Theater, both located
off of Main Street, were not very
comfortable and people stayed away,
said Parsons.

“The audience is important, par-
ticularly in a liberal arts college. It is
important for students who will not
get on stage to hear good music or
see good drama,”’ said Hotchkiss.

Parsons said on top of the comfor-
table seating, ‘‘people will enjoy the
theater because the drama depart-
ment puts on high-quality perfor-
mances and the way they cope with
the limitations is outstanding.”’

The stage will have a shock absorb-
ing floor, specially designed for
dance. The orchestra pit will be able
to house an ensemble equal to a
Broadway musical, while the stage
itself will be able to hold a 92-piece
orchestra, large choral groups and
dance companies, said officials.

Gordon said the center is going to
be very attractive and intimate. He
has a special interest in the size
because he helped design the inside.

“Oh God, I can’t wait,’’ he said.

Gordon has already contacted
agents to bring in ballets, touring
companies and the like.

“Neither the campus nor the town
has a nice performing theater, so we
were not able to bring in anything,”
said Gordon.

“It’s going to be a real gem for the
campus,”’ he said.

Lexington agents help with Thanksgiving and Christmas travel arrangements

 

By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington area travel agencies are
gearing up for the upcoming holidays
as Washington and Lee University

undergraduates and law students
begin making plans to visit family
and friends for the Thanksgiving and

Christmas holidays

Hannelore Roscher, manager of
Herring Travel Agency, said 30 per-
cent of the agency's business is from
W&L students, with the majority of

that being from law students. Betty
Collins, owner of Travel Unlimited on
Washington Street, said W&L
students result in only 5-10 percent of
its business.

Both agencies were quick to point
out that travel agencies work harder
than airlines to get the customer bet-
ter fares, are more likely to help
customers when complications arise
and are more convenient.

‘Well, now days there are so many
options and restrictions that exist,
travel agents can save a lot of com-
plications for travellers,” said
Roscher.

‘We can access all the airlines and
their fares. When you call Piedmont,
Delta or Eastern they'll give you
their fares, whereas we can give you
all the fares,’’ added Collins.

Collins said that much of the
general public is under the false im-
pression that customers pay travel
agencies for their services, when ac-
tually the agencies get paid a 10 per-
cent commission directly from the
airlines, hotels, rental car agencies
and cruise ships for which they make
sales.

“Another advantage [of using

Travel Unlimited] is that you get
$100,000 in flight insurance as a bonus
for every airline ticket you pur-
chase,”’ Collins added.

While W&L students are for the
most part going home for Thanksgiv-
ing and Christmas, winter and spring
breaks offer prime opportunities for
travel agencies to send students
snow-skiing in the mountains or to
the beach during the spring.

Collins said most students opt for
winter breaks snow-skiing in Col-
orado, adding that such ski resort
towns as Vail, Steamboat Springs

and Breckenridge are popular.

The two travel agencies said Mex-
ico, the Caribbean and Florida were
the most popular destinations during
spring break.

“Mexico is a wonderful deal,”’ said
Roscher, ‘‘because the U.S. dollar
has a lot of buying power there still.”’
She said such areas as Cancun and
Cozumel are very popular since they
have lower rates than many other
areas

‘Generally we send more people to
the Caribbean and Florida for Spring
Break,” said Collins. She said that
the Bahamas and Cayman Islands

were specially good for diving and
snorkeling. Roscher and Collins both
agreed that Florida was especially
popular among students who prefer-
red to save money by driving rather
than flying.

Collins said she had only one piece
of advice for W&L students who are
flying home for the holidays.

“Don’t wait until the last minute to
make reservations for low-fare
flights.’’ She added that seating was
limited and that it has been ‘‘impossi-
ble’ since last month to find good
fares on flights through Roanoke for
Thanksgiving
 

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, November 12, 1987

 

Giving:

Gifts help students

This Saturday is National Philanthropy Day, honoring the
many people who have given their time, talent and money to
help further education, charity and social causes. This
honorary day was enacted by a joint resolution in the United
States Congress.

Everyone at Washington and Lee should remember its first
major benefactor, George Washington. His generous gift of
canal stock, which is still drawing dividends today, saved the
university from obscurity, paving the way to its present na-
tional prominence.

The entire student body benefits from philanthropy. Even
students who pay all tuition, room and board costs receive
financial aid. Because of gifts to the university, costs are
lowered for everyone. Not only that, many buildings and
facilities are here as the result of gifts from people who care
— the future of the university and those who graduate

rom it.

William Wordsworth wrote, ‘The best portion of a good
man’s life (are) his little, nameless, unremembered acts of
kindness and love.”

We at The Ring-tum Phi do not want those acts that have
benefited this university to go unremembered. We would like
to express our gratitude to those individuals who have
dedicated their time and effort to the furtherance of
Washington and Lee. Without them it would not be the high-
level institution it is today.

Control

Recently there has been a problem with the supply of Ring-
tum Phis available for students, faculty and subscribers.

In the past the newspapers have been available in the lobby
of the University Center on Thursday evenings, as well as in
the dining hall and University Library. However, in the past
weeks, entire bundles of papers have been removed,
resulting in a shortage of papers. Because of this, many
students have not received papers, and the Phi has had pro-
blems meeting its subscription requirements.

Students pay for The Ring-tum Phi in their student activity
fee, and subscribers pay $25 to receive the paper for the en-
tire school year. Those who do not receive their paper are not
getting what they have paid for.

Everyone needs to remember that they do not pay for a
bundle of newspapers every week. In particular, fraternities
need to inform their pledges to only bring as many
newspapers as are needed for their houses. No fraternity on
this campus needs 150 to 200 papers at Thursday night dinner.

Everyone please take heed of this. It would be unfortunate
if the newspaper staff were forced to distribute the
newspapers in a different manner.

ly followed by initials of one of the members of the

larger

theatre
MY VIEW

By James Lake

 

Even though it’s probably too late,
I thought I might as well take one last
shot at introducing reason into the
plans for Washington and Lee’s new
multi-million dollar theatre. My
primary concern is not the price
tag—although there is an awful lot of
money involved. I’m mostly worried
about the fact that the main theatre
will seat only 425 people—that’s less
than one-third of the student body to
you and me.

A spokesman for the administra-
tion has said that there’s no
demonstrated need for a facility,
other than the Warner Center, that
will seat the entire student body. The
response to that is obvious: the
University doesn’t hold events that it
expects all students to attend
because there’s no such facility
available. Of course there aren’t any
campus-wide events indoors—there’s
no place to put everybody. The ad-
ministration’s argument is
analagous to saying a_ school
shouldn’t have home basketball
games because it doesn’t have a
gym; obviously, you have to have a
gym to have the cames in the first
place.

I can’t think of a better argument
for a 1500 to 2000-seat theatre than
last month's Parents’ Weekend Con-
cert in Lee Chapel. All this talk about
a facility large enough to hold the en-
tire student body for events such as
the Founders’ Day and Opening Day
Convocations has left out the people
whose dollars keep the school
running—Mom and Dad. Parents and
students attending the Choral and In-
strumental Concert on October 30
were standing in the aisles
throughout the two-hour event—nice
hospitality, W&L! According to the
W&L News Office, the chapel seats
approximately 625—that’s right, 200
more than the new theatre would.
And, with a new singing group star-
ting next term—the Women’s
Chorus—the over-crowding in. the
chapel can only get worse, as more
parents try to see their sons and
daughters perform. The people in
Washington Hall should keep in mind
the people who pay a large portion of
their salaries—the parents.

Another reason for a_ seating
capacity of four digits is the amount
of money involved. According to the
fund-raising brochure for the new
“Center. for the Performing Arts,”
current plans call for a ‘‘hydraulic-
powered orchestra lift,” a com-

puterized lighting system, ‘‘an or-
chestral shell of honeycomb
aluminum,” and a “shock-absorbing
floor’ for W&L’s  universally-
renowned dance program. If we're
going to spend all this money for
these neato, rinky-dink contraptions,
the entire student body certainly bet-
ter be able to get a lot of enjoyment
out of them.

There are plenty of other reasons
for a large auditorium/theatre. For
example, what if it had rained on
Jesse Jackson last spring? Gee, the
gym sure would’ve been elegant and
impressive on national television!
And how about bad weather for
graduation? Coach Daly can have a
free throw shooting contest for the
seniors while they wait for their
diplomas!

For a facility already estimated at
nine million dollars, there's no
reason why the architects can’t start
over and do this thing right. We’re
going to be using this building for a
long time. If the administration real-
ly wants the theatre to be ‘‘the heart
and soul of the campus,” if the in-
habitants of Washington Hall really
want the students to be ‘drawn even
more tightly together in the enjoy-
ment of the finest plays and con-
certs” as they claimed in their own
fund-raising brochure, then we
should be able to squeeze at least half
the student body in the place. Please,
Doctor Wilson and company: don’t
make a nine million dollar mistake.

 

 

 

 

Are longjohns valuable
as campus fashions?

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

During the course of my daily ac-
tivities on a recent Friday I noticed
that other students were staring at
me. At first I reasoned that the stares
were the product of some recent no-
ble act which I had committed in the
view of these staring students. But
not just a given population had their
eyes glued to me, everyone was star-
ing; staring not in admiration but in
disgust. It also occured to me that I
haven’t had the opportunity to do
anything noble since the boy scouts,
and I wasn’t even in the boy scouts.

The sad truth, I soon realized, was
that everyone was staring at my
clothing, more specifically my visi-
ble thermal underwear. I was
perplexed and wondered if there was
some presidential ordinance forbid-
ding thermal underwear of which I
alone remained unenlightened.

Possibly I had overlooked a nation-

wide boycott of long underwear
because they are manufactured by
the Soviet Union. I eliminated the
first theory because the president
wears thermal underwear and the se-
cond by a label check which proved I
was wearing American thermals.

‘‘Maybe I could just ask a starer,”’
I reasoned, but all seemed to hold a
great aversion to speaking to me in
public.

Finally I eavesdropped on a con-
versation concerning my garmets.
Apparently people were staring
because I looked ridiculous. This I
couldn’t believe. For one, owing to
my natural bad looks and lack of per-
sonal hygiene, -l usually look
ridiculous. Secondly, and more im-
portantly is that the very existence of
America is owed to poor dress habits.

Most of you probably learned in
grade school that the American
revolution came about because of
tea, stamps, and the fact that col-
onists were only allowed to drink
warm beer. This is a blatant lie.

What really happened is fashion
related. George Washington and
other patriots in the British Army
grew tired of the same old red coats.

LETTERS

So they made their own army and
allowed everyone to wear ridiculous
clothes. The British Army continual-
ly made fun of the Patriots’ bad taste
in clothing. The Patriots, who got
sick of being the butt of jokes in well-
known taverns, declared war.

So if it wasn’t for bad dress habits
you might be going to ‘“‘George the
Third and His Boring Family’
University instead of Washington
and Lee.

In fact, all social change since
before Cro-Magnum man was a pro-
duct of ridiculous-dressing. Could
Ghandi have accomplished what he
did without his offensive wardrobe?
Or moving closer to home, would
Professor Dytachek be the same
calculus teacher without his ties?
Think about it. .

And the next time you're about to
put on something which says
“Duckhead”’ on it, stop yourself. In-
stead, call up your parents and have
the clothes they wore in the 60’s sent
to you by Federal Express. Next,
wear these clothes. Within a short
period of time you can run for presi-
dent, and win, start a revolution, or
free political prisoners all over the
world.

 

 

To the Editor:

Lately I find myself looking forward to Thurs-
day evenings. This is not on account of some
special meal at the dining hall or the Cosby
Show, rather the occasion is the distribution of
the Ring-tum Phi. This fall’s paper has been
among the best I’ve seen in my years at W&L.
However, I have some criticism for your
coverage of the injuries suffered by Rowan
Taylor and Chris Jerussi. The first part of this
letter offers some suggestions for Jim Lake and
Mike Shady—the authors of articles on the inci-
dent. The second part of my letter will deal with
questions for the Phi’s editorial staff.

Mr. Lake provided an account of the accident,
but I feel he neglected to examine the cir-
cumstances surrounding the injury in a critical
manner. Mr. Shady tells us that he would have
done some things differently than Mr. Fallon,
but at the same time he seems to be cautioning
us not to be too critical of Mr. Fallon’s actions.
Two boys were hurt in that scrimmage—one of
them severely. A halftime scrimmage is
something out of ordinary and I feel Mr. Fallon’s
decision to hold one had a direct bearing on those
injuries suffered.

Football is a game where serious injuries do
occur I’m sure Mr. Lake and Mr. Shady know
that. But, do they know that the relationship of
fatigue to injury has been well-established? The
more tired a player becomes the more likely he
is to be seriously injured. Mr. Fallon’s decision
to hold a full contact drill increased the risk of in-
jury to his players in three respects: (1) scrim-
maging at halftime had the affect of lengthening
the first half—forcing the players to be on the
field a longer time than they are normally ac-
customed (2) scrimmaging deprived the players
of the recovery necessary to their maintaining
strength during the second half of the game (3)
the full-contact nature of the drills had the effect
of unnecessarily lengthening the duration of the
contact.

Mr. Fallon must explain whether or not he con-
sidered the risk associated with fatiguing his
player when he decided to conduct the drills.
Further, it must be determined whether or not
Mr. Fallon intended the scrimmage to be a kind
of punishment for the team's poor first-half per-
formance.

Why would Mr. Fallon decide to order his
charges into a situation which would put them at
serious risk? Mr. Fallon states that his purpose

 

for having the players engage in a full-contact
drill was ‘‘to instill aggressiveness.’’ He felt he
had ‘‘to do something to shake the cobwebs out of
our players’ heads.” He wanted the players to
“go back to the basics of good aggressive block-
ing and aggressive tackling.’’ Why didn’t the Phi
ask him what he meant by those statements? Mr.
Fallon needs to define precisely the meaning of
his term ‘“‘aggressiveness.’’ He owes an explana-
tion of what it means to want “to shake the
cobwebs’ out of players’ heads.

I was disturbed by the news the injuries suf-
fered during a school-sponsored activity. I am
concerned because I have not seen an adequate
explanation of the circumstances surrounding
the incident. I am anxious because I have seen no
assurance that a similar halftime scrimmage
won’t be allowed to occur. I am frightened
because the next time I might be reading about a
student being paralyzed or killed. The Phi has a
responsibility to speak for the student body. It
must remind the University that faculty and
staff who cannot demonstrate the emotional
maturity and the professional competence
necessary to assure the safety of student must be
dismissed. The responsibility that the University
bears towards it students demands nothing less.

Reader defends cheering

Ms. Pierson:

Despite what you may feel about W&L men
cheering for athletic teams from the women’s
colleges, I (and many others) obviously we feel
W&L men have every right to cheer for
whomever we please at an athletic event.

My sympathy for your sentiments about
rooting for the W&L women’s teams runs about
as deep as the tradition of women at W&L itself.
This is not tosay that W&L men have not and will
not encourage our own teams, both men’s and
women’s, but we have every right to cheer for
whichever team we choose.

There have been women at Hollins and Sweet-
briar much longer than there have been women
at W&L if you wonder why members of the class
of 1988 and others choose to cheer for the
women’s colleges.

If you do not like hearing W&L guys cheer for

Reader questions Fallon’s actions in halftime scrimmage

teams from other colleges I suggest you either
pay more attention to the game, move to the
other side, or just stay at home.

Thanks to APO

Dear Editor:

Once again we would like to thank John
Deighan, Service Vice-president, and the
members of Alpha Phi Omega, who gave of their
time and talents by volunteering at the
Rockbridge Regional Library, on Sunday after-
noon, October 4, from 2:00 to 4:30 p.m.

These men and women worked very hard to
shelf read the fiction collection, putting books in
the right places, straightening, and shifting the
crowded areas of the library stacks.

Last year the APO team worked on the non-
fiction adult shelves, and they have remained in
relatively good condition. However, the fiction
collection really got ahead of us. Once more this
powerful force moved in and brought relief to a
very congested and disheveled area. We ap-
preciate this hard work so much!

The library staff and users have marvelled
that APO has been so faithful in helping us! We
want your readers to know how much both Sun-
days of service have meant to the library and to
the community. Thank you, John Deighan and
APO!

Sincerely,
Linda L. Krantz
Library Director

Parents Weekend books up area hotels

 

By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

 

“We were full.”’

“We were full.”’

“We were full.”’

This past weekend, practically
every hotel, motel and motor lodge in
Lexington was filled to capacity as
the parents of Washington and Lee
University students descended upon
Lexington for parents’ weekend. Now
area hotels are counting their
revenue taken in from the latest in
the year’s series of big money-
making weekends.

Of six area hotels and motels con-
tacted, all were filled to capacity
both nights of parents’ weekend, with
most already full for next year’s
parents’ weekend.

“VMI and W&L reunions and
parents’ weekends are always
strong, as are the graduations,”’ said
Ramada Inn manager Bill Seay. He
added that 97 percent of last
weekend’s business was from the

parents of Washington and Lee
University students.

However, Joani  Hoffnagle,
manager of Holiday Inn, said that
W&L’s parents’ weekend is only one
drop in the financial bucket when it
comes to big college events.

‘Parents’ weekend is only one
weekend. Any of the college
weekends, such as alumni weekends,
parents’ weekend and _ football
weekends are substantial for
business,” she said. Hoffnagle added
that there are about 12 to 15 of these
types of weekends per year for W&L
and VMI combined.

“Graduation weekend is usually
the biggest weekend for both W&L,
and VMI,” said Days Inn manager
Sandra Hatter.

‘Well, we have other events, but
anytime we have W&L or VMI events
we fill up,” said Annie Blackwell,
employee at the Comfort Inn.

Blackwell said the Comfort Inn
does not use a waiting list, and that,
like other area motels, reservations
are done on a “‘first come, first serv-

ed”’ basis starting one full year in ad-
vance.

Hatter added that Days Inn also
begins booking reservations a full
year in advance. However, Days Inn
refuses to reserve all of the rooms.

‘We've got 152 rooms and we
reserve 130 of them. The rest we save
for off-the-road people.”

Hatter said that Days Inn reserva-
tions usually fill up ten months in ad-
vance, and it doesn’t keep a waiting
list.

Maxie Holland, manager of Best
Western-Keydet General on Rt. 60
East, said they were booked full
since last year and are already book-
ed for next year’s parents’ weekend.

“We put out a list and have our
guests sign up for next year while
they are here,”’ she said.

Ramada Inn manager Bill Seay
said Ramada Inn is unlike other area
motels because they wait two weeks
after annual events to begin taking
reservations for the next year’s
event. He added that they usually are
filled within two days after reserva-

“In addition to W&L, VMI and

W&L senior tells of his experiences during his year in the far east

 

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

They lay it on thick and hope you
catch on,” said senior Forrest Can
non of the profossors at the Chinese

University of Hong Kong where he
spent last year

“And,” he added, ““‘It isn’t any
easier when their explanation is in
Chinese.”

Despite his two years of Mandarin
Chinese at W&L, Cannon said he was
still at a disadvantage in the
classroom because the main dialect
of Chinese spoken in Hong Kong is
Cantonese. The written language is
the same

By far, Cannon said, the hardest
adjustment was the language. He
said most classes are similar to those
at W&L and added that in a math
course they went through the whole
book

‘The international finance classes
and math classes are comparable to
anything we have here,” he said.

During his two semesters in Hong
Kong, Cannon traveled to Canton and
Tokyo

97 . hh
Focusing

He said the difference in the cities
was obvious. Canton was more
‘dreary and pale. It is a much slower
pace of life, but it is the most
Chinese,’’ Cannon said. “‘It’s like go-
ing 100 years into the past,’’ he said.

“Tokyo,”’ he said, “is more hip,
while Hong Kong is like a bustling
metropolis. The attitude there is
more serious and businesslike.”’

Traveling to other places in East
Asia made Cannon appreciate the
United States.

“We are free from the major
depressed areas [that exist in
Asia],’’ he said. he added, “It gave
me a more mature perspective on the
world.”

This perspective is evident in the
way Cannon describes the people of
Hong Kong and some of the problems
that exist there.

He said most of the people in Hong
Kong are third-generation im-
migrants from China.

“They are competitive, hardwork-
ing, proud of their heritage and con-
cerned about their future,’’ Cannon
said.

For example, most of the textbooks

ra
cs

 

&

% z
on the issues

are written in English. Thus they
must learn English and learn the
material in the text.

Further describing life in Hong
Kong, Cannon mentioned the corrup-
tion that existed.

“Bribery is a way of life there, it
isn’t perceived as an immoral act,”
he said. ‘‘The Chinese have a very
sophisticated understanding of
where officials are coming from,”’ he
said, ‘“They know how far they can
stretch them.”

Cannon added that there will soon
be evidence of change in the Hong
Kong that he visited.

“There’s more free-wheeling now
than there will be in 10 years,” he
said. When the Communists move in
when the lease on Hong Kong ex-
pires, ‘‘the questions of free press,
free business activity and free
market” will pervade.

With regard to the East Asian
Studies Program, Cannon said
W&L’'s program is very worthwhile
and recommends it for the student
who wants to challenge himself.

However, he said that a year is too
long for the person who is not ge-

nuinely interested in another culture.

Cannon said, ‘‘The person must be
dedicated and enjoy doing things out
of the ordinary.”’

Cannon thought the program facul-
ty should try harder to promote it.
“Instead of having a_ specific
technical ability, the East Asian
Studies Program gives you a unique
background,”’ he said. “I think it will
be more practical in the years to
come. Too many people have cultural
blinders on,”’ he added.

Professor Roger Jeans, Director of
the East Asian Studies Program,
said they are trying to promote the
opportunities for semesters abroad,

General

but student interest is very low. He
called it a ‘lean year.”’

He attributed part of the lack of in-
terest in the fact that few East Asian
history courses were taught last year
since he was on leave.

Because of the lack of student in-
terest, Jeans has postponed the
meeting to choose students to ex-
change with The Chinese University
of Hong Kong, Rikkyo University in
Tokyo and Kansai Gaidai in Osaka,
Japan.

Currently, there are six students at
these universities.

All three universities are full ex-
changes. That means the student
pays his tuition at W&L and switches

the final 400 meters to win a regular

:* Season cross country meet. It was,

Hunsberger suffered heat exhaus-

Football ends losing streak against Ursinus

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The streak snaps, Coffland cranks,
and Fallon finally has number 49.

The Washington and Lee football
Generals scored 14 points off of two
second-quarter Ursinus turnovers
and hung on for their first win in over
a month Saturday, defeating Ursinus
College, 21-7, to end a four-game los-
ing streak and to give head coach
Gary Fallon his 49th victory at
Washington and Lee, the most wins
ever by a W&L football coach.

While the defense played perhaps
its best game of the season, senior
tailback Chris Coffland had the game
of his career, rushing for 189 yards
and two touchdowns on 35 carries.

“We were really pleased with
Chris,” said Fallon. “If I look back
over my ten years here, I don’t think
I could find a more intense and a
tougher football player.”

The game was a scoreless, three-
downs-and-punt defensive struggle
for the entire first quarter and most
of the second, until the turnovers
began.

First, Ursinus fumbled away a
W&L punt at its own six yard-line,

five-kilometer course in a time of
20:25. Cason’s time lowered her ail-
course school record by 18 seconds
and she was named ODAC Runner-
of-the-Year and all-conference.

“T didn’t have any strategy,’’ said
Cason. “I usually start out slow and
then pick up the pace with each mile
faster than the previous one. I sprint
the last part if I’m close.”

“‘’m very pleased for her,” said
head coach Jim Phemister. ‘She ran
very strongly. She did what she need-
ed to do to win.”

Despite Cason’s performance, the
women’s team finished a disappoin-
ting third in the team standings.
Eastern Mennonite, the favorite,
took the team title with 31 points,
Lynchburg came in second place
with 37 points, W&L scored 55 points
for third and Emory and Henry was
way back in the pack, scoring a
whopping 102 points for fourth place.
What made the third-place finish so
disappointing was the fact that the
Generals had defeated Lynchburg in
a tri-meet two weeks ago.

“Tt —— was in the range of

PVE Tt e ON

and junior Mike Holifield was there
to recover for the Generals. The W&L
offense took the field and immediate-
ly gave the ball to Coffland, who was
in the end zone while the Ursinus
defenders were still buckling their
chin straps. With 6:53 left in the first
half, freshman kicker Carter Quayle
gave the Generals a 7-0 lead.

The Bears took the ensuing kickoff
and drove to midfield, where senior
safety Tommy Donahoo halted that
drive with an interception—Ursinus
turnover number two. Sophomore
quarterback Phil Sampson went deep
on first down to—who else—split end
Hugh Finkelstein, and the 49-yard
pass completion gave the Generals a
fist down at the Ursinus two. Coffland
scored his second touchdown of the
day to cap a two play, 51-yard drive,
and Quayle added the extra point
with 44 seconds left in the first half.

The first sustained drive of the
game was put on by Ursinus in the
third quarter, ending on a five-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback
Kevin Parker to split end Kevin
Ross. The extra point cut W&L’s lead
to seven with 6:28 left in the third
period.

With its lead in jeopardy, W&L
decided to tell Coffland his real name

possibility that we would [come in se-
cond],’’ said Phemister, ‘‘but we still
don’t have enough depth yet. I think
it’s developing. We got third place
last year and we got third place again
this year but we were very much
more in the race this year. We’ll be
there very soon, I think. We’re just
not quite ready yet.”’

The other scorers for the Generals
were freshmen Shawn Wert (9th,
22:11) and Margaret Boyd (13th,
23:18) and juniors Anne Geary (15th,
23:30) and Stephanie Smith (17th,
23:49).

The Generals travel to Newport
News this weekend to compete in the
Eastern Regionals. Phemister is
anxious to see how Cason performs
against a fast field on a fast course.

“T’ll be curious to see what she
does at regionals,” he said. ‘“She’ll
havea little bit more competition and
she’ll find out a little bit more about
just how good she is. She’s quite a
good runner.”’

Phemister doesn’t forsee Cason
qualifying for the Division III Na-
tional ere unless she

was John Riggins, and the tailback
began cranking out the yardage and
running out the clock just like the
former Redskin running back.

“They were so intent on stopping
our wide outs and our passing game
that they did leave themselves
vulnerable to our run game,” said
Fallon. “Our offensive line did a
super job, and Chris Coffland did
some outstanding running.”’

Meanwhile, the W&L defense con-
tained any possible Ursinus rally by
holding the Bears to just 82 yards
rushing, easily the Generals’ best
defensive performance this year.
Junior linebacker Tom Skeen had
one of his best games ever, according
to Fallon, leading an “‘intense perfor-
mance” by the W&L defenders.

The Generals added an insurance
touchdown on a fourth-quarter pass
from Sampson to Finkletein. The
kick by Quayle with 7:13 left in the
game made the final score 21-7.

Fallon’s career record of 49 wins
puts him at the top of a list of some 26
men who have been in charge of
organized football at W&L since 1899,
when head coach T.G. Trenchard led
the Genereals to a 1-5-2 season
record. Saturday’s win put Fallon
ahead of Lee McLaughlin, whose

 

Paige Cason

takes individual honors. In last
year’s regional, which were held on
W&L’s course, the top runner ran
three to four minutes faster than
Cason’s best time on the course.

“There is probably going to be so-
meone at the regionals who runs on
that flat course maybe in the 17’s,,’
said Phemister. ‘“‘Paige isn’t ready
for that yet. She may come under
20. ”

Moore came down with a virus
known as the “‘shingles’’, the same
virus that causes the chicken pox,
said head coach Dick Miller. As a
result, the Generals had to race
without their No. 3 runner and came
in third place in the championships.
The final standings read Roanoke
winning handily with 25 points,
followed by Lynchburg with 49, W&L

= For the second time in four years,
Bvashington and Lee University will
“be the site of the NCAA Division III
wqmen’ s tennis championships.
On May 17-22, eight teams will
‘come to Lexington to compete for the
-coveted national championship in
“Div. Ill tennis. Lexington was also
the site for the 1985 championships
“when W&L’s team finished eighth in
*the nation.
- “Weare very excited to be worthy
“of hosting the tournament,’’ said
#W&L Athletic Director William
“McHenry. ‘‘I am particulary pleased
*because we have an outstanding
-team that finished second in the na-
_tion each of the last two years and
‘ethis might give us an opportunity to
“win a national championship. We
ithave not, previously, won a national
championship in any sport at
“Washington and Lee.”
» The Generals, who were beaten by
~Kalamazoo, Mich. in the finals the
“last two years, are ranked No. 1 in
the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches of
"America (ITCA) preseason poll.
»W&L returns five players from last
year’s squad, including juniors
‘Robert Haley and Bobby Matthews,
who are ranked No. 3 and No. 4 in
‘singles, respectively, by the ITCA.
»The Generals also return the ITCA
No. 1-ranked doubles team in the na-
‘tion in Matthews and senior David
McLeod. All three players garnered
‘all-America honors in last year’s
sehampionships at Salisbury State
College.
* In its process of choosing a site, a
number of factors are looked at by
the NCAA. According to the 1987
»NCAA Tennis Handbook, the follow-
ing criteria are used in the selec
‘tion process: (1) quality and

availability of the facility and other
necessary accommodations; (2)
revenue potential and (3) geographic
location. W&L was also helped by
what many considered its excellent
handling of the 1985 tournament.

“T think the reason that we were
selected was that we did a fine job,”’
said McHenry. ‘‘We did an excellent
job of hosting [two years ago] and
everyone complimented us on the
way it was done.”

“It’s just kind of the way the ball
bounces,’’ said W&L head tennis
coach Gary Franke. “Anybody can
host it. Anybody can put in a bid. We
just happened to be selected. We also
happen to have a great place to host a
championship and everybody was ex-
cited by the fact that it was coming
back to Washington and Lee.”’

Franke also said the condition of
the courts was an important issue.
W&L just completed the resurfacing
of its lower tennis courts and will
resurface its upper courts during the
school’s exam period in April of 1988.

‘We decided to host it this year,
basically because we had the ap-
proval to redo the courts, which I
thought was necessary and the most
important thing about the tourna-
ment,”’ said Franke.

“We did have to resurface the
courts to make sure that the lower
courts and the upper courts would be
in top shape for the tournament,”
said McHenry. ‘‘We want to host the
best tournament possible. We want
everything to be just fine for it.”

McHenry said Emory University
was the other school under con-
sideration along with W&L. Emory
had already been awarded the oppor-
tunity to host the 1987 Div. II]
women’s national championships, so,
according to McHenry, the NCAA
decided it did not want one school
hosting both tournaments.

on Friday. He may not run anymore
for us. It’s a very painful sort of
thing.”

Senior co-captain Scott Rippeon
was W&L’s top finisher, grabbing
third place with a time of 26:14 over
the eight-kilometer course. Junior
Bill Clark (6th, 26:37) was close
behind, and both Rippeon and Clark
earned all-conference honors for
their efforts. Senior co-captain Rick
Norris (14th, 28:42), freshman Larry
Pilkey (17th, 28:59) and senior Greg
Casker (22nd, 30:03) round out the
scoring for W&L.

The loss of Moore definitely hurt
the General’s chances of taking se-
cond place in the team standings.

Miller was pleased with Rippeon’s
performance, saying W&L’s No. 1
runner “‘definitely ran up to his
potential.” Miller expects a lot
tougher competition in the Eastern
Regionals this weekend ih Newport

I look at that as a compliment to my

end Gar Prebor, and split ends
John Roe and Hugh Finkelstein.

The Hoyas (5-2-1) have won
their last four games and are ‘‘an

ding to W&L head coach Gary
Fallon. ‘They play a wide-open

Defensively, Fallon said the

Every now and then a musician

will write a melody or lyric that
reaches in and grabs your emotions
by the throat. When it happens, a
surge of feeling rushes through your
body that suddenly makes you think
These pieces are usually few and far
between; but, occasionally a musi
cian will compose a few in a row. In
Nothing Like the Sun,’ Sting
creates enough to last a lifetime
There is no question that Sting has
taken his music to a higher plane in
the new release. The songs are
thicker, more rich, and musically
finer than the ones that preceded
them on “Dream of the Blue
Turtles."’ Although Sting still seems
to be fixated on the heart and world
oppression, the songs simply say
more than they did before
The lyrics will enrage you one
minute and make you cry the next.
The views that Sting has developed
as a member of Amnesty Interna-
tional clearly come out in the songs of
‘Nothing Like the Sun’’ just as
they did in “Dream of the Blue
Turtles.’’ Like U2, another Amnesty
member, Sting’s lyrics are not just
words on paper accompanying a
melody. The words mean something.
Textually, the album is very well
balanced. Side one begins with an
upbeat tune called “The Lazarus
Heart,” and the laid back ‘‘Be Still
My Beating Heart.’’ Side two opens
with another uptempo song ‘‘We’ll Be

‘Heaven’

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Part of living is coping with the
reality that everyone has to die and
considering what will happen to you
when that day comes. Many believe
that they will go to heaven when they
die. Yet, for such a universal idea, it
is strange to consider how many con-
ceptions there are of what “heaven”
really is. For many it is a resting
place, and for others, complete
euphoria. For Kelly McGillis and
Timothy Hutton, heaven is a place
for making love in the clouds and fall-
ing in love.

“Made in Heaven’ will not be
remembered ten years down the road
for the impact that it had on its au-
diences or for the monumental in-
fluence that it has had on film.
Rather, it will be remembered for the
questions that it has clarified. For in-
stance, did you know that:

1. In heaven, all you have to do is

Together” and “Straight to My
Heart,,’ a spanish, almost flamenco
flavored song. As if it weren't ob-
vious from their titles, all four songs
deal with affairs of the heart

The middle sections of both sides
deal with: random subjects. Side
one’s “Englishman in New York”
was written for a friend of Sting’s
who moved from London to New
York in the early seventies. Its com-
position is wonderful moving from a
bouncy, almost circus-like melody to
a jazz riff, a rock drum solo, and then
back to the melody for the coda.
“Rock Steady”’ is a jazzy tune on the
second side that gives a modern tell-
ing of Noah’s Ark. ‘Sister Moon,” a
song about the magical mystique of
the moon, and a jazzy remake of Jimi
Hendrix’ ‘‘Little Wing”’ follow.

Both sides conclude with what is
lyrically and musically the finest
work of Sting’s career. Side A ends
with ‘History Will Teach Us
Nothing,” ‘‘They Dance Alone,” and’
“Fragile;"’ three songs that subtley
attack the horrors of war. The
album’s final cut is ‘“The Secret Mar-
riage,’ a song adapted from a
melody by Hans Eisler, a musician
who fled .to America to escape
persecution from the Nazis who chas-
ed him his entire life.

‘They Dance Alone”’
and’’F'ragile’’ are the finest pieces on
the album. Jn ‘‘They Dance
Alone,’’Sting sings about a dance
that the Chilean mothers, wives, and
daughters do for the soldiers who
have ‘‘disappeared’’ under

2. There are IBM computers in

glad to hear that.)

3. You can make love in heaven. (I
know the rest of you are glad to hear
that.)

Director Alan Rudolph has made a
delightful film in ‘‘Made in Heaven.”
The story centers around Mike
(Timothy Hutton), who is leaving his
home to find a job in California. He
never makes it. Mike drowns while
saving a woman and two children
from a submerged station wagon.
(Quit complaining, this all happens
in the first ten minutes of the film
anyway.)

Mike arrives in heaven (totally
nude which kind of scares me) where
he is greeted by his aunt Lisa
(Maureen Stapleton). She teaches
him how to think his way around and
off he goes. The fun begins when he
crash lands into Kelly McGillis’ liv-

ing room (no longer nude poor guy).
From here on, the film gets a touch
cliche’. Boy meets girl, boy falls in
love with girl, boy gets to know girl
biblically in a cloud, and so on and so
forth. Sweet and simple right? Nope.
One catch; some of those in heaven
return to earth as a baby at some
point and guess whose number is up?

I'm not going to say anything else
about the story other than the ending
could have been much better than it
is. Unfortunately, ‘‘Made in Heaven”
was made in Hollywood. (You'll see
what I mean.)

As for the film itself, it is shot and-
put together quite well. The
cinematography of Charleston, S.C.
(used in the heaven sequences) and
Atlanta (used in the earth sequences)
are beautiful. Especially the heaven
scenes shot by the lake. Hutton and
McGillis give good performances as
usual, as does Maureen Stapleton.

Perhaps the oddest thing about the:
film though is its number of cameos.

Changes in tax laws affect financial aid

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

Recent changes in financial aid
laws and tax laws could cause some
students to give up their part-time
jobs.

Before the changes in the financial
aid laws were enacted by Congress
this year, students were routinely ex-
pected to contribute $1,000 of their
summer earnings toward their col-
lege costs.

These changes in the financial
assistance laws now require a stu-
dent to contribute 70 percent of his or
her entire yearly earnings, said John
DeCourcy, director of financial aid
for Washington and Lee University.

That means students who work
several jobs during the summer and
continue working part time through-
out the academic year will be con-

BV man sentenced

Michael Camden, 30, of Buena
Vista was sentenced to 120 days in
jail for assaulting a police officer and
will have a separate malicious
wounding charge, against
Washington and Lee University stu-
dent Pete Petino, sent before a grand
jury, decided Judge Joseph E. Hess
yesterday during the trial in the Lex-
ington General District Court.

Both charges stem from events
that occurred at about 1:45 a.m on
Oct. 18 as Petino was leaving the Chi
Psi fraternity house at 5 Lee Ave.

Petino said that Camden and two
other men, Tommy Coleman, 27, and
Robert Ward, 28, both of Buena

sidered to have more disposable in-
come and will no longer be con-
sidered as financially needy.

By earning “too much’ money
through summer and part-time earn-
ings, students may lose eligibility to
receive a guaranteed student loan, or
GSL.

‘‘What’s the sense in working if you
will be penalized for it?’’ said
DeCourcy.

“Because [students] have been
working hard, they lose GSL eligibili-
a
Last year, the changes in financial
aid required that parents declare all
their assets in applying for guar-
anteed student loans. Previously,
parents declared only income.

Students whose parents were in the
upper-middle income range had once
been eligible for a GSL. If that same
student’s parents own their own
home, that student is no longer eligi-

Vista, pushed by him and entered the
fraternity after he had told them to
leave because they did not belong at
the party. Two of the men, Camden
and Coleman, came back toward
him after a few moments, Petino
said, with knives.

Petino said that he told the men
that the fraternity was not the place
for such actions and as he turned
back to look at a friend, was punched
by Camden. A scuffle ensued during
which the pair fell on the floor. Petino
said he tried to keep the knife away
from his body but still suffered a cut
on his left index finger.

As the men were separated by par-
tygoers, police pulled up outside the
fraternity and the three accused
assailants fled. Petino said he then

ble, and the parents are expected to
mortgage their home to cover college
costs, said DeCourcy.

Additionally, changes in the laws
last year require students who
receive scholarships or grants that
cover expenses other than tuition and
books (such as room and board) to
pay taxes on those grants.

According to Gerard R. Esposito,
IRS District Director in Richmond,
“beginning this year only degree
candidates can exclude from tax
amounts received as a qualified
scholarship. A qualified scholarship
includes amounts used for tuition,
fees, books and supplies required for
courses. Other amounts such as those
received for room and board or
travel are no longer excludable.”’

One of this year’s changes in the
financial aid laws is that parents who
are enrolled in college at least half-
time (6 credit hours per semester)

are considered when deciding a fami-
ly’s need of federal assistance, said
DeCourcy.

Parents were not previously con-
sidered as needing assistance if they
were attending college.

For example, suppose a family is
judged as having $10,000 to spend on
college tuition. If one son or daughter
is the only member of the family at-
tending college, he or she will not
receive financial assistance, because
$10,000 is expected to cover all the
costs. If a parent of that family takes
six credits at a nearby community
college by attending night school or
weekend classes, there are two
members of the family attending col-
lege. The available $10,000 is cut in
half ($5,000 per person), and the stu-
dent becomes eligible for financial
aid.

“Obviously, [the law] is subject to
manipulation by parents going to

to four months

noticed that blood covered his hands,
and he was taken by Officer Mark
Ramos to Stonewall Jackson Hos-
pital. Petino said he did not need to
have any stitches for the cut.

Petino said he saw Camden at the
hospital, along with the two other
men from the fracas at the party.
Petino identified the men to Officer
Ramos, who placed the three under
arrest. Ramos said that he loosely
handcuffed Camden so as not to ir-
ritate Camden’s wounded hand.
Ramos said that Camden was being
verbally abusive, grew more and
more agitated and swung his hands
across Ramos’ temple.

Camden’s lawyer said that his
client only became abusive after he
asked to have the handcuffs loosened

and they were not. He also said that
there was no direct evidence that
Camden actually cut Petino because
the cut may have come from some
other object during the scuffle.

Judge Hess decided that the
malicious wounding charge, known
in some states as felonious assault,
against Petino be sent before a grand
jury. Camden appealed his sentence
of 120 days in jail for the charge of
assault against a police officer,
Judge Hess said.

Tommy Coleman's charge of
malicious wounding was reduced to
assault. Coleman received a six
month jail sentence, suspen ded on
good behavior. Robert Ward receiv-
ed null process, or no punishment as
there was not enough evidence to pro-
secute.

Mumps outbreak strikes campus

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

Several cases of mumps have been
confirmed on the Washington and
Lee campus this fall, according to
Robert M. Pickral, M.D., director of
the Student Health Center.

“T had personally never seen a
case of mumps until this fall,”’ said
Pickral, who has been with the health
center for four years and in private
practice for almost a decade.

The six or seven cases of mumps on
campus are unusual because they
are affecting students who were im-
munized during childhood against

the virus. In the cases that have been
clinically confirmed, only one stu-
dent had not been immunized.

The virus generally takes three to
four weeks to be confirmed through
tests, said Pickral. Students who
show symptoms now will not be con-
firmed as having the mumps until
three weeks from now.

According to Pickral, two factors
seem to be contributing to the high
number of cases on campus: the im-
munization may not be “‘holding’’ as
a student grows older and the closed
environment may allow the virus to
spread more easily.

In addition to the characteristic
swelling of the glands in the neck, the

Faculty petition asks

By Jessica Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

Freshmen are not getting a good
look at the academic life at W&L,
said W. Lad Sessions, professor of

, philosophy.

Sessions said he gets the sense that
the early portion of the fall term is
very disruptive because the fresh-
man males are forced to worry about
their social life in fraternities at
W&L, making it hard to focus in the
classroom.

Sessions decided it was time to
place the academic aspects of the
school at the top.

In September, he circulated a peti-
tion among the faculty stating that
those who signed the petition believe
“there would be significant aca-
demic advantage to deferring
freshman fraternity rush until the
winter term’? and requested the
Students Affairs Committee (SAC) to
present some proposals on the issue
to the faculty by February 1988.

“It is important for students to
relate to one another before they
divide into groups,’’ said Sessions,
explaining that fraternities divide up
the freshmen before they have the
chance to form their own friendships.

“The primary emphasis at W&L
should be on academics, but by the
same token I do not think we will see
a substantial increase or improve-
ment [in grades] among the fresh-
men,” said Mark Farley, Interfrater-
nity Council (IFC) president.

Farley said in the fall of 1986, male
fraternity pledges had an average
grade point average (GPA) of 2.405
while the average GPA of non-
fraternity males was 2.58. He said
that the statistics show there is not
much difference in the GPA’s.

Farley said many of the professors
say they are tired of having freshmen
with hangovers in their Thursday
morning classes

SAC for deferred rush

“T think that if the faculty believes
that a deferred rush will prevent
freshmen from drinking or prevent
freshmen from participating in
fraternity parties, they are in for
more of an education than the
students,”’ said Farley.

The petition received 116
signatures from all departments ex-
cept ROTC and the law school, said
Lewis John, dean of students. He ad-
ded that the petition may not have
been circulated in those two areas.

“I was surprised at the reception of
the faculty. I did not think there
would be as much support,” said Ses-
sions.

Farley said he understood the
philosophical viewpoints of the facul-
ty’s reasons for deferred rush as
positive, but ‘I do not think the quali-
ty of academic life would be improv-
ed.”’

Farley said that a deferred rush is
not the answer and fraternities must
find a proper balance. He suggested
that rush continue to be held in the
fall and that it go as quickly as possi-
ble, so that students can get on with a
normal lifestyle.

Both Sessions and Farley foresee
the possible financial damage defer-
red rush can bring to the fraternities,
without the revenue that would usual-
ly come in with the new members.
Farley said this could strain the
fraternities’ ability to finance par-
ties.

But Sessions said it is not
necessary always to have parties at
fraternities. He suggested that
students could have dorm parties,
which would not be centered on the
fraternities.

“There would be a sense of class
and school unity,’’ he said

Sessions said he does not think the
fraternities can rush for an entire 12
weeks because of the heavy financial
burden as well as the time and
energy it will take

 

mumps virus can cause swelling of
the ovaries or testicles. According to
Pickral, none of the cases at
Washington and Lee have had that
symptom. Immunization may be a
factor in helping keep the W&L cases
from becoming severe and causing
swelling of the reproductive organs,
said Pickral.

Pickral said he sees no evidence
that the W&L cases may be caused
by a new strain of the mumps virus,
although it may be possible. There is
no evidence that affected students
were given ineffective immuniza-
tions, said Pickral.

The week-long Thanksgiving break
should help the situation by acting as

ee |

a unofficial quarantine, getting
students out of a closed environment
where the virus may spread more
easily, said Pickral.

Pickral said he will talk with the
state health department to determine
if there is cause to have an epidem-
iologist to study the cases, but hopes
that the Thanksgiving and Christmas
breaks will prevent further spread of
the virus.

“We'll just have to wait and see
when the students come back,” he
said.

Other than the W&L cases, there
have been no confirmed cases of
mumps in the Lexington and
Rockbridge area, said Pickral.

As IFC president, Farley said he
hopes that fraternities will continue
to stress the concept of responsible
drinking.

Farley said the SAC and IFC are
addressing the problems. He said
that one of the proposals that will be
presented to the faculty in February
will be a counterproposal from the
IFC.

Farley said he would have trouble
implementing a policy he believes is
detrimental to the fraternity system

‘I’m not out to get rid of the frater
nities, nor is this to reprimand the
fraternities,’ said Sessions, adding
that he does not believe the present
system is the only way to carry out
rush nor is it the best

Farley said that if rush is held in
the winter term, ‘‘the fraternities
will be tripping over themselves try-
ing to impress freshmen throughout
the fall term.”’

Not only will it cause a financial
burden, but a possible legal problem
as well, said Farley. The freshmen
will not be affiliated with the houses
and if something happens to a
freshman after drinking at a certain
fraternity, then the fraternity could
be placed in a difficult legal situa-
tion, he said

“The biggest liability to frater
nities concerns the possible injury of
people who are not affiliated with the
house,”’ said Farley

school [ just to get more financial aid
for their son or daughter],’’ said
DeCourcy.

The changes in the financial aid
laws do not include a grandfather
clause, and that bothers DeCourcy.

According to DeCourcy, many
juniors and seniors came to W&L
counting on the money they could
receive from GSL and their own
earnings. In several cases, students
decided they could come to W&L
rather than going to a less expensive
state school because they were able,
with financial aid, to cover the costs.

“As the kid moved through, every-
thing is sliced away after the fact,”
said DeCourcy. Students who were
once able to meet college costs may
now find themselves scrambling.

The impact of the changes in finan-
cial aid laws will probably not be felt
fully until January, when students
begin applying for financial aid for

the 1988-89 academic year

In the long term, the changes could
mean fewer students applying to ex
pensive private colleges and more
people going to state schools, more
parents taking out mortgages to
cover college costs, and, perhaps,
more parents themselves going back
to school, said DeCourcy

The changes themselves are most
likely to achieve what they were
designed to do: lower the number of
people taking out guaranteed student
loans, said DeCourcy

DeCourcy suggested students try
to prepare for the problems the new
financial aid laws may cause

“Better to get a good deal of warn-
ing on it, so you can plan the best ap-
proach.”’

“Tibet: Struggle for Identity.”

Students report theft of
valuables from library

 

 

“And here is our library, it is open 24
hours a day. We have study carrels
where you can leave anything.”

That is what the library staff at
W&L hears Student Recruitment tour
guides tell prospective students, said
Peggy Hays, publice services librar-
ian.

‘“‘We would rather the tour guides
did not stress ‘you can just leave
anything,’ because it is not true,’’ she
said.

JoAnn Wilson, public services
librarian, said she asked last year
that the point be omitted, but Mark
Farley, co-chairman of Student
Recruitment last year, said he was
not informed of such a request.

“T do not think that there is a tour
guide saying that you can leave
anything," said Farley, who is also
chairman of this year’s group

He added that if the tour guides are
misrepresenting the use of the car-
rels, then such an error does need to
be corrected, but he does not think
that they are presenting an unrealitic
view of the situation.

He also said he does not think the
prospective students are so naive as
to think that they could leave watch-
es and valuables lying around and ex-
pect to find them later.

Although there have been reports
of missing items, Farley said, ‘‘peo-
ple know that things are being taken
and it concerns them, but it does not
shake their view of the Honor
System.”

Farley believes it would be a
disservice to the library if tour
guides said it was an unsecure place

“There is a strong belief in the
Honor System and I think it is our
job, as tour guides, to represent that
faith,”’ he said

The staff at the

library said

students should not leave wallets,
calculators and valuables, and it
asks students to use common sense.

Farley agreed and said if students
leave valuables, they are leaving
themselves open to theft.

“There is a great honor system,
but to assume that W&L is a little
paradise is a myth,”’ said William
“Burr” Datz, assistant director of
security.

He said that the library’s 24-hour
accessibility is the problem because
it is difficult to monitor the coming
and going of everyone

“It is a Catch-22 situation, because
the library should be open 24 hours a
day, but because of the access, who
knows who comes and goes,”’ he said

W&L Security is aware that items
are being taken from the library and
has a patrolman monitoring the
building, but it said one is not enough

“*T would not leave anything around
where someone would take it,’’ said
Charles ‘‘Murph”’ Murray, director
of security.

Murray said that the reports of
missing items and_ stolen goods
“have been going ever since I’ve
been here.”’ He joined the W&L staff
in 1959.

Hays said that students leave
materials in the carrels so they will
not have to carry them back and
forth from their dorms to the library
She emphasized that caution must be
used as well as common sense about
the personal itmes being left in the
carrels

Brad Root, president of the Ex
ecutive Committee, said that
students must take a sensible ap
proach because the library is a public
facility and is very vulnerable to peo
ple from outside the University com
munity

Root said that freshmen are told
during orientation that personal pro

OPINION
Finances

When the new year rolls around, a large number of
students may be surprised at what the federal government
has in store for them.

Financial aid has been subject to government scrutiny as
of late and with the new tax laws, changes have been made.
Some of these changes will definitely discourage students
from attending more costly private schools, and will herd
them into the state schools. Some students may be forced to
abandon their private education for cheaper instruction
elsewhere.

At the core of these new regulations is a rule requiring
students to use 70 percent of their income to pay for their
education. This means students will no longer be able to ap-
ply only $1,000 of their summer earnings toward school.
Wages earned from jobs during the school year must also be
declared.

The case of dorm counselors shows the effect another rule
will have. In the past, students have become dorm counselors
partly to defray the cost of college. Now the value of the free
room and board they receive will be considered income. As a
result, dorm counselors will be taxed for tha income even
though they never receive cash income.

That is only one example of the inherent dangers of this
new system.

To make matters even worse there is no type of grand-
father clause to protect students who have already planned
their college education with financial aid. That means
students who have been enrolled at Washington and Lee for a
year or more may find out they can no longer afford to attend
school here. The least the government could do is agree not to
pull the rug out from under financial aid students already in
college.

Other victims of the new tax laws are parents. They are
now required to declare all their assets, not just their income.
So any family that owns, say, a house, will have to declare it
as an asset. Consequently, because the asset will make the
student ineligible to receive a GSL, the family must take out
a mortgage on the house to pay for an education.

There has been talk recently of plans to crack down on
former students who have defaulted on their GSLs, as well as
colleges with a high rate of defaulting students. These plans
make much more sense for saving the government money in
financial aid than the new tax laws. Instead of punishing
those who are trying to further their education, punish the
people who have cheated the government out of money. ;

Let’s hope no one will be forced to leave W&L because of
these new laws. But Director of Financial Aid John DeCourcy
is correct to warn students to understand the coming changes
and be prepared. Only through careful preparation can stu-
dents ensure their future education.

Trust

Students at Washington and Lee take the Honor System
very seriously, and trust their fellow students to an excep-
tionally high degree. This can be seen in the unlocked doors,
the unattended bicycles and the backpacks left waiting in
academic buildings.

However, students need to realize that sometimes their
trust may be violated.

It is not other students that people must fear. It is the peo-
ple that come on to our campus that do not fall under our
Honor System.

A perfect example is the University Library. Students
realize that they can keep their study carrel just by leaving
their books and such in it (although students do have to sign
up for the carrels before taking them over). It is wonderfully
convenient to have all the materials necessary for studying
waiting in the library whenever they are needed.

Unfortunately, students have often elected to leave
valuable personal belongings, such as cassette players, in
their carrels. This is unwise for a number of reasons, but par-
ticularly because it tempts people from outside the W&L
community to steal it.

The library is a 24-hour building. It is open to students from
schools other than W&L. To leave valuables lying around is
foolish because it is virtually impossible for the library staff
to keep every potential thief out of the building, especially at
night. :

This is not to say that every visiting student or townsperson
is a thief. It is merely to warn W&L students to be careful in
their trust of the Honor System. Although it works.wonderful-.
ly within our community, outside W&L not everyone
understands or abides by it.

Honor system revisions depend
on interested students who apply

 

MY VIEW
By Margaret Pimblett

 

How about another column on the
state of the Honor System at Wash-
ington and Lee?

I don’t mean glorifying the Honor
System as the backbone of our entire
educational environment. That’s
been done before.

Neither do I wish to extol the
memory of St. Robert of Lee, the fine
founder of the system as we know it,
who brought the tiny Washington Col-
lege back from the terrors of the War
between the States to occupy a posi-
tion of might in the world of educa-
tion for young men (and now women)
of promise. We all know how much
General Lee did for our university.

What I would like to do is tell you
about an opportunity that is available
to every student at Washington and
Lee.

Is there anything, anything at all,
about the Honor System that you
think should be changed? Specifical-
ly, should anything be changed in the
White Book, the short but vital
treatise that defines the expectations

Stretching

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

The Thanksgiving holiday begins
tomorrow and for many students it
will be the first time home since
September. Of course, Thanksgiving
is a good time to relax with the fami-
ly, eat good food, and see’old friends.
But don’t lose perspective; the most
important activity for any authentic
college student is to go back to their
high schools and lie! Washington and
Lee students who are bound by the
Honor Code cannot do this and in-
stead return to their high schools on-
ly to stretch the truth.

To become truly adept at stretch-
ing the truth (lying) one must follow

 

 

and the administration of the system
itself?

This year, Brad B. Root, the presi-
dent of the Executive Committee of
the student body, has called for ap-
plications for the White Book Revi-
sion Committee.

The committee will review the
policies set out in the White Book and
determine if any of those policies
should be changed. :

The Honor System is supposed to
represent the views of the current
student generation. What better way
to guarantee that it in fact does that,
than by allowing members of that
generation to study the White Book
and make corrections if they see fit?

Sounds like a great idea to me. In
fact, it sounded like such a great idea
that I thought students would be
clamoring to be appointed to the
committee and begging Mr. Root to
consider them for the positions
available.

That hasn’t exactly been the case,
however. The deadline for applica-
tions was extended several times to
give more people time to submit their
applications.

Unfortunately, even allowing for
noted procrastinators like myself to
finally get around to writing a letter
of application, only about a_ half

dozen people did so:

Mr. Root said he had hoped to have
at least 25 students would apply, so
that the Executive Committee could
choose about a dozen well-qualified
students to work on the revisions.

Well, maybe I should have started
this column as an overview of student
apathy at sports events and just ex-
tended it to encémpass the Honor
System.

But it’s a bit scary to think that
nearly the entire student body simply
ignored the chance to be actively in-
volved in the Honor System.

So, I took a poll to determine if
students really were apathetic, or
maybe just uniformed. I interviewed
the journalism students who were
slaving away at the computer ter-
minals in Reid Hall to see if any of
them had known that such a thing as
the White Book Revision Committee
existed, and that applications had
been accepted earlier in the term.

Of the six students working, only
one had any idea that the E.C. had
called for applications, and he wasn’t
really sure what it was all about. And
remember, these were journalism
students, who are supposed to have
some idea of what’s news.

This brought up an entirely dif-
ferent problem. Maybe the E.C.

didn’t publicize enough, so that
students would know what was going
on.
The formation of the committee
was noted several times in the of-
ficial minutes of the E.C. that are
posted around the campus, and was
mentioned in a Ring-tum Phi article
about an E.C. meeting.

Perhaps the E.C. should have hung
posters announcing the application
deadlines, so that the many folks who
don’t have time to read all of the
items in the E.C. minutes or who
don’t read the Phi word for word
would have known about the commit-
tee.

Since the E.C. didn’t hang floures-
cent orange 11 x 14 inch posters on
every door, column, and _ bulletin
board on campus, no wonder the
average student didn’t know any-
thing about it.

Well, now you have no excuse for
being clueless. Here is your notice.
And you'll have another chance dur-
ing winter term to apply—the E.C.
has decided to try again and ask for
applications in January.

And, lest you think that I’m not
practicing what I preach, my ap-
plication was one of the few that was
recieved before the deadline in Oc-
tober. Now it’s your turn.

various members of the high school
community I attended.

Popular student (who I always
hated): So, how’s college?

Me: Well it’s hard finding time to
study between the every-night, all
night keg parties, thousands of
women who are constantly trying to
get into my dorm room, and the
president who keeps calling me for
advice. Right now my G.P.A. is only
a 3.85, but then again I am quadruple
majoring in the four hardest areas.
(The truth: No one will even let me
into a party, there aren’t even a thou-
sand women at W&L and the ones
who are here avoid me like the

plague, the president only knows me
by my articles which he believes to
be hurting the university’s credibili-
ty, and lastly, all I do is study and my
G.P.A. is nowhere near a 3.8).

My high school math teacher: (Ina
smug tone). So Jon, how do you like
college calculus? Math never was
your favorite.

Me: Well, Mrs. Dimwitty, I wish it
was just a little more challenging.
I’ve made an A-plus on every test and
I only go to lecture when the pro-
fessor needs me to teach a topic that
he can’t understand. (The truth: I go
to two lectures every day and I’m
praying I can makea D.)

My high school coach: So Jon, how
do you like college waterpolo?

Me: I love it. I really felt good scor-

ship game. My college coach thinks I

I hope my examples will come in
handy when you go back to your high
school and tell lies (1 mean stretch
the truth). In the event that you feel
guilty about stretching the truth,
though you shouldn’t, just remember
that the basis of any high school con-
versation is lying. For example, high
school student number 1: Did you
hear that Jack was ina car accident?
He broke his arm.

High school student number 2: I
heard he’ll never walk again.

High school student number 3:
Jack’s dead! (The truth: Jack had a
fender bender. )

Good luck with the tall tales at your
high school and if you feel really con-
fident try the same thing on your
family.

 

 

To the Editors:

As a senior, and thus a member of Washington
and Lee's last ‘‘all-male”’ class, I’ve had to ac-
cept, and even learn to live with, my school’s
decision to become coeducational. However, one
aspect of that female invasion remains par-
ticularly annoying: the allowance/tolerance of
women in the library.

Women must be allowed to use the facilities, I
suppose, but (as I’ve sadly come to realize) cer-
tain restrictions need to be imposed. Why? Well
for starters, it seems that no matter when—day
or night—there are always five or 10 or 50 silly
wenches running amuck on each of the library’s
five floors. Giggling, gossiping, and (dare I say
it? )—bitching—may be the normal behavior at-
tributed to W&L’s version of the fairer sex, but
leave it behind in the dorms! With tests and

papers burdening us with their ponderous
weight, how can studying in a theoretically
“quiet” library be achieved when one is con-
stantly harrassed by little lasses evoking high-
school memories in thought, voice, and action?
Answer: it can’t be done. Solution: ban women
from the library.

A ban is necessary, though to hope for one in
the near future would be to chase an elusive
dream. If not a total ban on women in the
biblioteque, then at least keep them corraled in
the fourth floor smoking lounges—out of sight,
mind, and earshot. In addition to relieving the
noise problem, there would finally be an ade-
quate number of carrels for the W&L men who
rightly deserve them. How about keeping the
library open only to males and senior girls? The
transfers from the neighboring women’s colleges
have enough maturity and poise to handle

themselves in a public place without embarrass-
ing themselves by acting like 4-year-olds. If
women must be permitted, then only from
2:00-6:00 in the morning—and provide free, man-
datory muzzles.

These are but a few suggestions from a
veritable cornucopia of solutions—hopefully
they’ll be put to good use. This isn’t a blight on
women in general, they are necessary after all,
and they remain but helpless prisoners of their
nature. Latent in that nature hides a vague
silliness, lying dormant, only to be sprung upon
us as a manifestation of its owner’s childish
transformation once the library doors slowly sw-
ing shut. I hope that W&L women will see the fol-
ly in their ways and begin to show a little more
common courtesy.

Peer counselors are
Called ‘listening ear’

 

By Jessica Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

Where do students go if they are
having problems dealing with school,
stress, alcohol, drugs, parents, social
life or depression and are not comfor-
table talking with a professional
psychologist?

The peer counseling program at

, Washington and Lee University pro-

-~

vides students at the university with
an alternative.

The program started as an idea in
the fall of 1986 and was available to
students in the winter of 1987, said
Dr. James Worth, university counsel-
ing psychologist.

Worth said the idea for a peer
counseling group is not new, but in
the years before coeducation, he did
not believe students would have been
as receptive to the program.

Since the start of the program
there have been several calls to the
hotline and several peer counselors
have been contacted individually for
counseling, Worth said.

“Last year nearly all peer
counselors had some contacts. It was
not a case of heavy usage, but the
fact that they were being used says it
is worth keeping,”’ he said.

The group has nearly doubled in
size from last year. Worth attributes
this to the fact that the program has
become more visible, which has en-
couraged more students to partic-
ipate in it.

give of themselves. If they are given
an opportunity, they will help the

Satellite interview allows

 

By Jennifer Bandrowski
Staff Reporter

 

Massachusetts Governor Michael
Dukakis appeared in W&L’s Northen
Auditorium via satellite on Friday,
November 14. The live interview
from Texas A&M’s Rutter Theatre
Complex was sponsored by the
Young Democrats and the Mock Con-
vention.

More than 50 schools across the na-

* tion participated in the satellite inter-
, view by telephoning with questions

following the governor’s brief open-

¢ ing remarks.

t

“The next president of the United

, States should be someone who brings

strong economic leadership,”’

»Dukakis said, who has based much of

his campaign on the “economic
miracle’’ in Massachusetts.

“T hope this is an election where

+young people become actively involv-

ed,” he said. ‘I hope that as much as

 

 

 

community,” he said.

The peer counselors were chosen
not only for their desire to reach out
to other students, but for their own
ability to overcome problems of their
own, said Worth.

‘“‘We want somebody who has pro-
bably had intense problems and life
stresses and have pulled their act
together through counseling, faith, or
maturity.’ Worth said.

“They are compassionate, mature,
good listeners, empathetic and
capable of earning the respect of
students,’’ said Worth.

Worth explained that the peer
counselors are not presently in the
middle of a problem, nor did they all
have intense problems, but ‘‘they
have the ability to look at the pain in
their own life and look at their own
hurt and understand the pain of
others.”

In order to insure that peer
counselors are capable of taking on
the challenge of peer counseling,
they are interviewed and go through
a mandatory and intensive training
program, explained Worth.

The first training program lasts a
full day, and subsequent sessions are
held for half a day once a month, said
Worth.

The training that peer counselors
receive is life-long, said Bryan
Bishop, head peer counselor and
third-year law student.

“The first priority is to have the
training so I can make the difference
for someone with my experience and
background,” he said.

Bishop said the experience as a
peer counselor doesnot stop at W&L,
but can be carried into careers, fami-

John Kennedy inspired my genera-

Washington and Lee was the last of
approximately 10 schools able to ask
a question on the air. The question
was asked by law school student
Samuel Conner:

“Governor, much of your cam-
paigning has focused on the vastly
improved economic situation in
Massachusetts, for which you have
taken much credit. However, in
response to the shutdown of the GM
plant in Framingham, Mass., which
resulted in the layoff of 3,700
workers, you said, ‘Every time
something happens around here it
has little to do with my political cam-
paign.’ On the surface, it seems that
you are claiming responsibility for
the victories, but divorcing yourself
from the losses. Is this the sort of
‘teflon’ policy we can expect from
you if elected president?”

The governor smiled as the quota-
tion was cited. “Unfortunately, cars

fill out applications after the first of
the year,’’ she said. Like other real
estate agencies, Mead Associates re-
quires people to fill out applications
before they even discuss options
available.

In addition to the most basic infor-
mation such as the applicant’s name,
address and age, applications, also
called tenant questionnaires by some
local agencies, usually request infor-
mation concerning the type of pro-
perty desired by the applicant, the
number of roommates involved, the
price range desired and whether the

“The whole focus of peer counsel-
ing is to provide students with a very
accessible and appealing resource
for talking about their problerns. A
student can understand another stu-
dent more quickly,” said Worth,
supervisor of the program.

we learned in the training session
was how to listen in a different way.
We really did not know how hard it

the country

Once the applications are received,
real estate agencies then begin the
task of finding an available place to
match the applicant's request. Hous-
ing is usually distributed on a ‘“‘first
come, first served”’ basis.

Local realtors say that most
students usually prefer to rent apart-
ments rather than houses, and that
they would rather live in town than in
the country, although there are many
exceptions.

“Living in town is more popular,

especially among girls, because they
like to be in walking distance to
school,’’ said salesman Mike Flint of
Mays Real Estate. He added that the
decision to rent a house in the coun-
try usually depends on whether
transportation exists for the
students.

Tamara Hamric, realtor at Vita &
Associates, stressed the importance
of students making appointments to
speak with realtors. She also said it
helps if students have an idea of what
they are looking for before visiting
the realtor.

 

 

we were listening to him sympa-
thetically,’’ said Dana Anstine, a
member of the peer counseling team.
Dorm counselors and resident ad-
visors are available to help students
with their problems, but after a stu-
dent leaves the dorms, they are no
longer a resource. Peer counselors
can fill that void, said Baxter Sharp,
a peer counselor at the university.
“The program is a group state-
ment that it is not abnormal to have
needs; you are human if you have
problems,”’ said Bishop. a
“We are the listening ear,” said

a hotline (463-8999) beginning after Thanksgiving break.

Meredith Walker, assistant head of
the peer counselor group.

Although the program was not fre-
quently used last year, she hopes it
will be utilized more this year.

“It is a slow thing, but it is gradual-
ly beginning to grow as more people
are learning about the program,”’ she
said.

Sharp said the number of ap-
plicants shows that the program is
more visible. Last year, people did
not know much about the program,
but Sharp said this is changing.

Although there are a few nine
month leases available, most local

leases are for a full year. Many
realtors therefore have waiting lists
for students who have made a deci

sion as to which house or apartment
they wish to live in, and some, such
as Hamric, encourage students to

check between semesters for newly
available apartments

All realtors encourage students to
begin making plans early in the year

and then contact the realtors as soon
as possible to be assured of getting
the type of housing desired.

By Perry Hayes/The Ring-tum Phi

The hotline number, 463-8999, will
not go into effect until Nov. 30, the
day after students come back from
Thanksgiving break.

The hotline operation hours are
Sunday-Thursday: 7 p.m.-11 p.m.;
Friday and Saturday: 8 p.m.-12 p.m.

Students can call or meet with any
of the 26 peer counselors in con-
fidence, said Worth.

The peer counselors’ goal is to
“provide immediate and non-
threatening mental health resource
as a first step,” he said.

expect that production in that plant

He pointed out the Massachusetts
government’s response to the closing
of a General Dynamics shipyard. He
emphasized the importance of
‘Tresponding] quickly, sensitively,
helpfully,”’ by teaching ‘‘new skills
and training if workers are laid off.”’

Mock Convention co-chairperson
Chip Gist explained, ‘We came up
with six questions, and put them in
priority order...and we were able to
ask our first choice.”

The questions were composed by
Stephen Sears, William Maddox,
Chip Gist, Sam Conner, and Young
Democrats President Kristi Good-
man.

Questions asked by other schools
covered topics ranging from apar-
theid to acid rain.

Gist commented, ‘‘On the whole, I
don’t feel Dukakis really influenced

anyone’s opinion either one way or
the other because of his vague
responses. But the event was
beneficial because it allowed
students across the country to direct-
ly interact with a Presidential can-
didate.”’

Goodman was more favorably im-
pressed with Dukakis. ‘I thought he
did a real good job in explaining his
particular views on _ various
issues...It gave people a chance to
find out more than they knew
before.”’

As to the overall event, Goodman
said, ‘‘I was real pleased to see
Young Dem’s there as well as some
College Republicans and others who
were just interested.”’

Approximately 50 people attended
the presentation.

Wa&L sponsors Ethics Institute

For 13 years now, W&L has been
host for the Legal Ethics Institute,
bringing lawyers from across the
country and students from W&L
together to discuss the sensitive issue
of legal ethics.

Two weekends ago the 13th annual

This year the Institute focused on
the role of lawyers as providers of

every year, there is less and less self
regulation. If attorneys are to regain
their status in society they must be
willing to hand down harsher punish
ments to negligent attorneys.

Spivey also addressed the problem
of attorney advertising. Should
lawyers be allowed to advertise? And
if they are, should they be regulated?

ROTC Rangers finish well in competition

 

By George G. Sparacio
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Universi-
ty ROTC Ranger team fared well at
the 1987 Fourth Brigade Ranger
Challenge Competition at Fort
Meade, Md., on Oct. 23-25.

Each Ranger squad from par-
ticipating schools sends nine
members to the competition each
year, testing skills such as basic
marksmanship, weapons assembly,
construction of a rope bridge and
physical stamina.

Led by Cadet Major and Ranger
Commander Christopher Beckert,
the team finished fairly well, coming
in 13th out of the 25 teams. The team
did best in the road march, finishing
ninth.

Although the cadets did not win the
competition, Beckert said that they
were pleased with their performance
and know what to improve on for next
year. He also said that the team will
do much better next year since only
four seniors will be graduating.

“You have to lose before you know
how to win,”’ said Beckert. With five
team members returning next year,
they have a good shot at winning the
title.

ROTC Rangers practice construction of a one-rope bridge for the Ranger

Challenge Competition.

The Ranger program at W&L has
two major goals. Being a Ranger
gives ROTC members extra practice
and experience in Ranger skills, such
as rappelling, spelunking and patroll-
ing. In addition, it gives the cadets in-
tensive training in regular army
skills, such as marksmanship and

communications.

Beckert said that in the first year
of the program, a Ranger is taught
basic military skills. In following
years, the Rangers teach these skills
to junior members of the club.

Beckert said, “The ROTC depart-

ment here at W&L is top notch. The
Ranger program just allows the
cadet to practice his skills in depth.”’

The Rangers have an orientation
weekend for freshmen planned some
time in the early spring, when the
freshmen will have a chance to rap-
pel and fire the M-16 rifle.

Computer Science’s cup runneth over

 

By Melinda Conkling
Staff Reporter

 

The sign on the door in Robinson
Hall said, ‘‘Class will meet in Parmly
305.’ Computer Science 110 was be-
ing held in Parmly for 81 reasons—81
students in one class.

Due to an overabundance of Com-
puter Science students, the computer
science class was being conducted in
a classroom that could contain 81
students. Yet the question
remained—How could one professor
effectively instruct 81 students with
individual promblems and anxieties?

Answer: Teacher’s Assistants.

Associate Professor of Computer
Science Kenneth Lambert divided
the students into six sections—each
directed by a teacher’s assistant
(t.a.). Lambert lectures four times a
week in the classroom and the t.a.’s
meet with their students at obli-
gatory “‘help sessions”’ twice a week.

The t.a.’s_ responsibilities are
varied. At help sessions they answer
student questions regarding the
week’s assignment and attempt to
solve any mechanical difficulties.

According to Lambert there were
two main reasons for establishing a
t.a. program.

“The first was because like any
science course, students need atten-
tion outside the classroom and more

possibly give. The t.a.’s also benefit
from this experience. It helps up-
perclassmen who are majoring in
computer science to deal with people
who know very little about their (the
t.a.’s) prospective field.”’

Lambert approached the t.a.’s at
the beginning of the '87-’88 school
year. Most of the assistants are com-
puter science majors and he was
already familiar with their
knowledge of computer science.

The benefits of being a t.a. are
equally rewarding for students and

“T think there is a definite need for
individual help. There are too many
computer science students,” stated
freshman Mary Hampson.

“T’ve gotten a better understand-

the courses and I’ve met lots of
freshmen who otherwise I probably
would have never met,” stated senior
Etienne Cambon. ‘‘Dr. Lambert had
81 students whom he knew he
couldn’t give the proper attention to.
He needed us to thoroughly grade
projects and check student pro-

said, attorneys did not have to adver-
tise because they were well taken
care of in their firms.

distinguished speakers the Institute
has attracted. Other noted speakers

compare the student program to the
prepared program and evaluate the

“This semester no one has bombed
out and in previous semesters they
have. I think this improvement is
largely due to the teacher’s
assistants,”’ stated Lambert.

And next year? According to
Lambert, “‘if the enrollment remains
as big, yes, there will be t.a.’s again.
I'd like to see more t.a.’s because
even with the six that we have,
students have trouble getting enough

to get a basic idea from the students
of what they thought the discussion
group should entail.

It was generally agreed upon that,
because a lot is expected from the
female students here, they could pro-
bably identify with many of the
female figures of biblical times who
were under similar circumstances.

“...These women in the Scrip-
ture...were the best and brightest of
their generation,” said Robinson. “I
proposed that idea and think that a
chord struck there with what those
characters might have to say [to
women today].”’

Sophomore Kristi Goodman was
glad that such a group had finally

been organized. ‘‘It’s just good to get
some of the girls together....She
(Robinson) is really in tune with
young people...good at com-
municating.”’

“T like it a lot,’ commented junior
Courtney Harpold, “because I don’t
know anything about women in the
Bible.”’

She added that having a woman
minister as a leader was an especial-
ly interesting aspect of the group.

Discussions are held every
Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. in the
Women’s Center on the bottom floor
of the University Center. All female
students are encouraged to come.

Hoyas humble the|

Generals in finale

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee football
Generals ended their 1987 season
with a 28-14 loss to the Georgetown
Hoyas Saturday on Wilson Field,
leaving head coach Gary Fallon
disappointed about the loss but not
about the season overall.

“The players stayed together
thoughout the year, no matter what
happened. They played with intensity
in every game,”’ said Fallon, whose
teams have won more games than
any other football coach in school
history.

“IT am disappointed with the loss
and our final record (3-6), but that is
not an indication of the way I feel
about this team.”’

After a late arrival on the field, the
Generals received the opening kick-
off only to punt three plays later. In
fact, most of the first quarter was an
exchange of punts. The only scoring
threat of the first period came on a
missed field goal attempt by W&L
freshman kicker Carter Quayle The
drive began when W&L linebacker
Tom Skeen intercepted a pass by
Hoya quarterback Matt Zebrowski
but ended when the kick sailed wide
from 28 yards out.

The Hoyas took over and, three
* plays into the second period, kicker

‘ma

Tom Timperman put Georgetown on
the scoreboard with a 39-yard field
goal. The Hoyas led, 3-0, with 13:36
left in the first half.

After another exchange of punts,-
Quayle missed yet another field goal,
this time from 42 yards out. The
Hoyas took over but fumbled on first
down, and the loose football was
recovered by the Generals. W&L
wasted no time in scoring, as
sophomore quarterback Phil Samp-
son hit split end Hugh Finklestein on
a 27-yard TD pass on first down. The
first-year law student suffered a
wrist injury on the play, however,
and left the game for good. Quayle’s
extra point gave the Generals their
first lead of the game, 7-3, with 6:02
remaining in the half.

The Hoyas drove 49 yards in 11
plays and pulled within one on a 26-
yard Timperman field goal with 1:50
left in the second quarter. After a
short W&L posession and a Skeen
punt, the half ended on a missed 30-
yard field goal attempt by Timper-
man, leaving W&L on top, 7-6.

Georgetown was a different and |
much better football team in the sec-
ond half, outscoring W&L 22-7. The
Hoyas received the opening kickoff
and drove 76 yards in nine plays, in-
cluding a 26-yard scoring pass from
Zebrowski to tight end Joseph

Clark’s effort earns
regional honors

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

For the Washington and Lee cross

country program, last Saturday’s

| South-Southeast Regional Champion-

_ ship at Christopher Newport College

_ was an opportunity to show off some
- of its individual talent.

Junior Bill Clark of the men’s team
_ ran the eight-kilometer course in a
personal best of 25:49, good enough
for 15th place and _all-South-
Southeast honors. Freshman. Paige
Cason of the women’s team took 21st
place in a time of 19:38, good enough
to once again lower her all-course
school record.

“I was really pleased,”’ said Clark.
“I had my best time ever for eight
kilometers. I guess I just went down
there ready to run.”

Clark defeated fellow teammate
and senior co-captain Scott Rippeon
for the first time this season. Rippeon
was the General’s No. 1 runner for
every meet this season but, accord-
ing to head coach Dick Miller, Rip-
peon was not quite 100 percent for the

' regional meet.

“Scott’s been running the last cou-
ple of weeks with a little hamstring
’ pull,” said Miller. ‘Nothing serious.
Bill just turned in the best perfor-
mance he’s ever turned in, that’s all
there is to it.”’

'  Rippeon finished 18th in 25:57 with

freshman Kennon Walthal (55th,
28:32) and seniors Richard Norris
(59th, 28:38) and Joe Geitner (60th,
28:56) rounding out the scorers for
W&L. The Generals finished eighth
out of 12 teams in the team standings
with American College of Puerto
Rico the surprise winner of the
region.

“Nothing happened. We just faced
some better teams,’ said Miller.
“This American College of Puerto
Rico blew everybody away. Nobody
expected that from them.”’

Miller was pleased with the
General’s season overafl‘and is op-
timistic about next season. Clark
echoed these sentiments.

“Next year we will be looking
good,” he said. ‘‘This year we started
slow, but we got our act together
when we ran against teams in the
{Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence].”’

For the women’s team, Cason was
the one who definitely had her act
together. On the flat and fast course,
Cason broke 20 minutes for the first
time this season and was the ODAC’s
top finisher in the region. Freshman
Shawn Wert (32nd, 20:54), junior
Anne Geary (36th, 21:31) and
freshmen Margaret Boyd and Pat
Lopes (50th, 22:48 and 5lst, 22:54
respectively) were the other scorers
for the Generals. W&L finished

seventh out of eight teams, well
behind Mary Washington who won
the meet.

season on

sour note

From Staff Reports

 

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team’s dreams of playing in the
NCAA championships were thwarted
by its own “pensive” offense at the
Easterii Championships Saturday
and Sunday in Annapolis, Md.

The Generals, seeded fourth in the

East, lust their opening game to fifth-
seed Bucknell, 15-8, putting them out
of contention. W&L later beat Army,
97, and lost to the University of
Arkansas/Little Rock 8-46. The top
two finishers in the Eastern Cham-
pionships receive bids to play for the
national championship.

“I arn disappointed that we didn’t
give our best effort. Offensively we
were not all there. We were just too
pensive and not in the flow,”’ said
head coach Page Remillard.

W&L finished the year with a 24-4
record and won the Southern League
Championship. ‘‘Uniess you win the
national championship there is
always something you can look at
which your team could have done
better. We could have played better
last weekend, but it does not take
away from the great season we had,”’
said Remillard.

Canfield: Team will
shoot the 3-pointer

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Changes. That’s what’s going to
happen to the Washington and Lee
basketball team in the upcoming
season. Changes in offense, changes
in attitude and, most importantly,
changes in performance.

The Generals open their season
this weekend by playing host in the
W&L Tip Off Tournament, featuring
teams from Newport News Appren-
tice, Welsey College and the Univer-
sity of the South.

Last season in college basketball,
the NCAA passed the three-point shot
rule, setting the distance at a measly
19’6”’. Last season, W&L head coach
Verne Canfield said he didn’t like the
rule and wasn’t going to incorporate
the shot into his offense. Last season,
the Generals watched as opposing
teams buried three-pointer after
three-pointer, resulting in W&L's
15-10 regular season record and an
early first-round exit from post-
season play.

This season, Canfield, starting his
24th year as head coach, has taken a
180-degree turn in his thinking about
that little strip of tape on the Warner
Center floor.

“We have designated three-point
shooters,’ he said. ‘It’s a very in-
tegral part of our offense. I’ve gone
on record saying I don’t like the rule,
but we are going to deal with it
because I really didn’t coach well
against it last year. We would like to
make five to six three-pointers a
game.”

The change in offensive strategy is
not the only alteration made in this
year’s squad. Canfield predicts that
the personnel he puts on the floor is
going to show more character and
leadership.

“You'll see some guys playing with
perhaps a little more heart,”’ he said.
“A little more of simple, basic want-
ing to win. That's extremely impor-
tant to me right now—that we estab-
lish that attitude. I think we had
some slippage in that area in the last
couple of years.”’

One player that unquestionably
showed character last year was Jef-
ferson Harralson. Harralson, the
team leader in scoring and reboun-
ding, finished 11th on W&L’s all-time
scoring list with 1,219 points, Unfor-
tunately for the Generals, Harralson
picked up his diploma in June.

“You don’t replace a player like
Jefferson,’ said Canfield, “simply
because he was a very fine athlete. I
don’t think any one person is going to
doit. We've got to doit as a team, and
that’s more in line with our thinking.
Good players come and go and you
don’t worry about replacing them,
you worry about what you got.”

The Generals have four seniors
returning, with guard Steve Hancock
the only player who sterted con-
sistently. The other seniors are
center Harmon Harden and forward
Gary Schott, who are penciled in as
probable starters, and center/for-
ward Lou Trosch, who will see plenty
of time coming off the bench. The
other starters for W&L will be junior
point guard Manny Klump = and
freshman forward Ed Hart.

As for the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference, Canfield predicts
the usual powers of Roanoké and
Emory and Henry to be leading the
pack, but is also looking out for the
Scots from Maryville. ‘

“Maryville will probably surprise

everybody,’’ he said. “‘They have got
everybody back and three transfers
who are ‘impact’ players.” The

Generals finished 4th in the con-
ference a year ago with an 8-6 record.

from Zebrowski to split end Greg
Adami gave the Hoyas a 14-7 lead

After three plays by the W&L of-
fense, Skeen again came into punt,
and the Hoyas again put on a scoring
drive. Georgetown traveled 77 yards
in 13 plays to score on a one-yard
carry by the Hoyas’ all-time rushing
leader, junior tailback Dean Lowry
Timperman’s extra point gave
Georgetown a 21-7 lead with 3:47 left
in the third period

But three great plays by junior run-
ning back Tony Waskiewicz put the
Generals right back in the game.
After freshman Mason Pope return-
ed the Hoya kickoff to the W&L 33,
Waskiewicz ran for fifteen yards on
one play and 29 on the next. Two
plays later, he scored on a 22-yard
pass from Sampson. Quayle’s kick
pulled W&L to within seven with 2:15
left in the third quarter

Georgetown was in possession and
driving to begin the final period and
scored with 13:13 left in the game on
Lowry’s second touchdown of the
afternoon, a 39-yard pass from
Zebrowski. Timperman’s extra point
put the Hoyas back up by 14.

W&L had three more chances to try
and cut into the Georgetown lead but
fell short all three times. First,
Sampson was intercepted by Hoya
linebacker Joe Pecoraro with 9:16
left. The Generals second drive
began after Zebrowski was_ in-
tercepted by W&L freshman corner-
back Clark Wight, but Sampson was
sacked on first down and threw three
incompletions.

The Hoyas took over on downs, ran
three plays and punted. Sampson
returned to face a first down at the
W&L 34 with only 1:52 left. After driv-
ing to midfield, Fallon pulled most of
his starters and ran out the clock.

Swimmers are ready

 

From Staff Reports

 

The 1986-87 season for both the
Washington and Lee men’s and
women’s swimming teams will be a
hard act to follow.

The men’s team had an 8-1 record
and dominated the Tri-State Con-
ference, beating second-place
Frostburg by 125 points.

THe women's team, in just its sec-
ond Year of operation and with just 10
swimmers on the roster, had a winn-
ing record (5-4) and a perfect Old
Dominion Athletic Conference record
(4-0).

In the freestyle sprints, W&L is
blessed with a number of proven per-
formers. Junior all-American Jeff
Bercaw, who was eighth in the 50-
yeard freestyle at the NCAA Cham-
pionships a year ago, and junior
David Reavy, an NCAA participant
in 1987 and the school record holder
in the 200-yard free (1:43.83), are two
of many swimmers who will score
points for W&L in those events.

The most experienced long-
distance freestyle swimmer is junior
Moose Herring, who owns W&L’s
second-best time in the 1000
(10:04.11) and third-best in the 1650
(16:55.90).

The backstroke events should also
be a team strength with the return of
sophomore all-American David

Olson, who placed seventh in the
NCAA championships in the 200-yard
backstroke last year. He holds the
school record in both the 100 (54:04)
and 200 (1:56.23).

The women will be entering year
three as a team, but is already
developing a winning tradition
according to Remillard.

This year’s team has 16 swimmers
on the roster and seems to have an
excellent balance for both dua4-and
championship meets.

The most notable returnee is junior
all-American Elizabeth Miles, who
owns five school records. Miles earn-
ed her all-American award in 1986 in
the long-distance freestyle events,
but did not swim in last year’s NCAA
Championships because of a broken
foot. This year she is fully recovered
and ready to lead her team again.

Swimmers to watch are: sopho-
more Kris Amoroso, who holds the
school records in the 100-yard back
(1:07.14) and the 200-yard back
(2:26.05); junior Nancy Whalen, who
has the school record in the 50-yard
free (27:06); sophomore Debbie
Grove, who has school records in the
100-yard fly (1:06.60), the 200-yard fly
(2:21.93), the 200-yard IM (2:20.72)
and the 400-yard IM (5:01.72); and
sophomore Heather Logan, who has
the school record in the 100-yard
breaststroke (1:15.14) and the 200-
yard breaststroke.

 

Shades on sports
By Mike Shady

Sports Editor

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nice job, Mr. Chase

I like reading The Lexington News-Gazette’s sports page because |
like Sports Editor Doug Chase’s column, ‘‘From the Sideline.’” Why?
Well, because Mr. Chase has a rare talent—he’s able to get personal
with his audience without being boring and without sounding fake. Mr.
Chase is genuinely interesting and sincere.

I wish I could say the same for those sports columnists at The
Washington Post. Let me ask you one question: Have you ever noticed
how one of those guys always writes a column on the Redskins’ game?
How many sidebars do you need for one football game? I want to know
what these guys really think and feel about all sports, not whether or
not they admire Jay Schroeder for his passing arm. The Post’s pro-
blem is simple. Too much fluff, not enough stuff. Ken Denlinger,
Thomas Boswell and Andrew Somethingorother (I can’t even recall
his last name, that’s how memorable his writing is) have a bad habit
of glossing over issues without really giving any opinions or
arguments of substance.

Another gripe. What ever happened to a columnist’s sense of
humor? Is Sports Illustrated the only place where I can read
something funny? The Philadelphia Inquirer is just as bad as The Post
in this area. It’s a game and funny things happen in a game. Why is
everyone so damn serious all the time? Make me laugh, entertain me,
do something to make me want to read your column. There's a time to
be serious and a time to poke fun at people and situations. Be
creative—Craig Neff’s “Point After” in this week’s SI is just some
great creative writing. Curry Kirkpatrick’s infamous ‘‘Me and my
very good friends” story during the NBA championships was pure
gold. Let’s see some more of this kind of writing.

Which brings me back to my original point about Mr. Chase. He ex-
periments. He is willing to take chances. He is, bottom line, fun to
read. That piece on his childhood friend breaking the 100-meter dash
world record? Great stuff. Surprising, isn’t it? Sometimes it’s not the
“big-time” sports writer but the guy in your own backyard that suc-
cessfully touches his readers. Writing a column (for me, at least) is
one of the more enjoyable aspects of working for a newspaper. It’s a
chance to be yourself. Mr. Chase is himself. Denlinger, Boswell,
What’shisname, Bill Lyons and Frank Dolson (of The Inquirer) just
don’t see to be as natural or as honest. Mr. Chase, I’m impressed.

NOTES—In last week’s Phi, men’s cross country runner Richard
Moore was reported to have the ‘‘shingles,” a virus that also is
associated with the chicken pox. Although Moore did have the virus,
The Phi’s story somewhat exaggerated the extent to which Moore con-
tracted the illness. Moore did not have the virus ‘‘break out all over”
his body but, instead, was infected only on a small area on his chest.
The Phi just wants to clarify the situation... William Perry does not
deserve to play in the NFL. He is overrated, fat and a disgrace to the
game of football. On Monday night, Perry maliciously pulled the
facemask of a Denver running back, spinning the player 180 degrees
and then giving an extra tug for good measure after the play was over.
Couple that with Perry’s body slam of Neil Lomax last season and you
have an extremely dangerous 300-pound plus person running loose in
the NFL...Another comment on the Perry incident. All three of ABC’s
broadcasters, Al Michaels, Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf, wimped
out. I expected at least one of them to come out and say that Perry
should have been ejected from the game. But, as usual, guts are not to
be found in that broadcasting booth...Congratulations to the W&L
water polo team forits great performance this season. The disappoin-
ting showing in the Eastern Championships should not mar what was
an exciting and spectacular fall...

Do you know anyone with bulemia
or anorexia? What about bulimarex-
Ha, a combination of the two? Dr.
Marlene Boskind-White, a nationally
‘nown expert on eating disorders and
rauthor of “Bulimarexia: The
‘Binge/Purge Cycle,” will give a lec-
jure addressing eating disorders on
Tuesday, Dec. 8, at 7 p.m. in the Moot

were the U.S. Military Academy, ac-
cepting 10.2 percent; the U.S. Naval
Academy, 11.9 percent; Stanford
University 15.6 percent; U.S. Air
Force Academy, 16.2 percent; and
Princeton University, 16.5 percent.

According to Julia Kozak,
Associate Director of Admissions,
W&L will most likely move up in the
survey next year. The admissions
department accepted only 29 percent
of the applicants for the class of 1991,
down almost five percent from the
34.2 percent for 1990.

“TI think Washington and Lee has
always enjoyed a national reputa-
tion,’ said Kozak, ‘‘but there’s no
question that everywhere we go
we’re seeing more interest in W&L.”’

Kozak said while co-education is
not singly responsible for the in-

highest per capita amount raised by
any college or university in the
United States. W&L was behind only
Syracuse University in total amount
raised, added Knapp.

Pledge packets and information
can be picked up in Carol Caulkins’
office in the University Center. The
minimum amount of pledges needed
to qualify for dancing is $100 in cash
or checks. Any pledges above the
base $100 that are smaller than five
dollars must be cash or checks, as
well.

As incentives for the dancers to br-
ing in larger donations, prizes will be
given in three categories: highest
total donation raised, highest cash
donation raised, and highest total
donation raised for a single organiza-
tion. There will also be door prizes
and dance contests every hour
throughout the dance.

“It’s wonderful to be in this kind of
company,” said Kozak, referring to
W&L’s ranking with other
prestigious schools. However, incom-
ing students should not base their col-
lege choice on surveys, cautioned
Kozak.

“We're the 23rd choosiest college,
but we're not the college for

The 43 choosiest colleges selected
by USA Today are listed in order with

At this stage of the planning, prizes
to be awarded include a weekend at
Hotel Roanoke, a weekend at Green-
briar, and a weekend in
Williamsburg. Other prizes are a
season ski pass and four free ski
passes and rentals for surrounding
ski areas. “Right now,” said Knapp,
“prizes are still coming in.”

The afternoon event of the dance
will be a “‘battle of the bands” among
three or four local bands, said
Knapp. At this time, the bands have
not been confirmed, but the Conver-
tibles, a Phi Delt band, and a VMI
band have been approached, he add-
ed.

The Superdance Committee has
also been holding slave auctions at
area women’s colleges.

“These auctions function both as
fund-raisers, and also as a way of
familiarizing the women as to what

also said that it was much easier to
diagnose anorexics than bulemics
because an anorexic’s symptoms are
noticeable.

Anorexics starve themselves to
death to stay thin. They usually lose
at least 25 percent of their body
weight, hair falls out in patches, skin
has a pale tone and even on a hot day
they will feel cold.

in political research.

The hotline produces, ‘‘...up-to-
date information on any news having
to do with the presidential race right
now, including both the Democrat
and Republican parties,”’ Gist said.

According to Gist, updates on
“campaigns, all of the latest polls—
about two to three a day—and the
calendar for the next seven days of
each political candidate,” are includ-
ed in the reports.

The service is provided by ‘‘...a
company based out of McLean,
Virginia, made up of political scien-
tists and academics,”’ Gist said.

Gist cited an example of how the
service might be useful: If Bruce

“This will help us tremendously
with our political research,” Gist
said.

Gist reports that the overall con-
vention planning is going well.

“We're going to do some polling
before Christmas of all the
Democratic national committee
members, including state and local
officials, to find which candidate they
are backing. So our political research
is running right on schedule,” he
said.

Also before Christmas will be the
first large mailing to solicit funds for
the convention. Letters will be sent to
all who have contributed to W&L’s
general fund in the last five years.

Journal chairman Jeff Kelsey has
been busy selling advertisements for

Gist says that he has had, “...a real
good response so far. It’s advan-
tageous to anyone who wants to do

Convention security plans for the worst

By Amy Balfour
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Security Committee
for the W&L Mock Convention will be
spending many hours preparing for
the March convention to make sure
that everything runs safely and
smoothly.

‘My main purpose is to brainstorm

‘and go through what could happen,”

said junior Fray McCormick who is
co-chairman of the committee with
senior Greg Unger.

A lot of their hours of preparation
will be wasted, McCormick said,
because all the possible problems
they plan for might not happen.

Their work started with
Democratic presidential candidate
Jesse Jackson's outdoor speech last
spring.

The committee coordinated securi-
ty for the whole event, working with
campus security, city police, cadets

att OMS rere ee

from VMI and a state trooper, Mc-
Cormick said.

Security got together with the
facilities committee and went over
the floor plan to determine where to
put security people in order to keep
Jackson safe and avoid any pro-
blems.

“It’s more behind the scenes,’’ Mc-
Cormick said of his responsibilities.
The committee had to work on such
possible problems as where would-be
assassins would fire from to what to
do if there were alcoholic drinks in
the crowd.

For the latter problem, he said,
security even had to plan what to do
if a VMI cadet had problems enforc-
ing the no-drinking policy.

In that case a W&L security
member would have to back up the
VMI cadet.

If the convention itself in March
draws a big-name speaker such as
Former President Jimmy Carter or a

Hees OE BOT ET A shes — ¢ a

current Democratic presidential can-
didate, McCormick and the commit-
tee will have to work and coordinate
plans with the Secret Service.

Security will have to go over the
floor plan of the gym, where most of
the activities will occur, with the con-
vention’s facilities chairman, Tim
Brennan, McCormick said.

By looking at the floor plan, he
said, they will again try to figure out
where possible trouble points will be.

He said that security will also
patrol the area during the convention
and check things out.

The committee is shooting to
employ 20 to 25 students, male or
female, in addition to campus securi-
ty.

The main expenses, he said, will be
for walkie-talkies and for paying
students on the Security Committee.

The students will be paid, he said,
because ‘‘they are giving up time to
beresp’ sible.”

  
    
   
  
 
 
  
   
   
   
   
  
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 
OPINION
Shorter

Some rumors have been circulating that the administra-
tion may be planning to change the length of Thanksgiving
break. While we do not know if this is true, we would like to
encourage the administration to seriously look into shorten-
ing Thanksgiving break.

In its present form, the week-long break comes much too
late in the term to serve as an effective break. An effective
break should be one that allows students to enjoy a brief rest
from academics. This does not mean students need breaks
during which they do no work, but instead a break that allows
them ample time to relax and work.

Ten weeks of classes with no breaks, except for weekends ,
have transpired by the time Thanksgiving break arrives.
Most college students, being the undergraduates that they
are, manage to fall behind in their work somewhat in that
amount of time, regardless of how diligent they attempt to
be. Even students who are up-to-date with their work are
often facing term papers and important tests immediately
after break. All this work has to be contended with over the
break, while visiting relatives and taking care of other such
holiday amenities. And after the break is over, finals are
looming just two weeks away.

The administration should consider this: make Thanksgiv-
ing a four-day weekend and insert a three-weekday reading
period at the midterm. This would help the problem in a
number of ways. Most importantly, students would be able to
catch up a large amount of work at the midterm, while still
being able to relax some during their break. This would help
reduce the ‘“‘burnout’”’ among students that tends to hit later
in the term when workloads begin to become unwieldy.

Helping students to lessen their workload earlier in the
term will also serve to make the Thanksgiving holiday more
enjoyable. Students will not have to spend the entire break in
a catch-22 situation--feeling guilty for doing academics and
not visiting relatives, and vice versa.

A break at the midterm will also enable students to prepare
for the numerous exams that are scheduled at that time. It is
not fair for the students when they have to neglect some
studies because their workload is too unmanageable. The
shorter break would help students to do what they are here
for--learn the material in their classes, not find ways to get
around it. ‘

Some will say that a shortened Thanksgiving break will
prevent some students from returning home for the holidays .
However, people must remember that Christmas break falls
only three weeks after Thanksgiving, and there is plenty of
time then for students to fly or drive home. That time can
even be lengthened by a student’s scheduling of exams, one
of the many advantages to life at Washington and Lee.

There are enough positive reasons for a shortened
Thanksgiving break to warrant the university to seriously
look into implementing the changes. After all, the changes
are for the benefit of our education, which is what we are
here for in the first place. wan

Ranking

Once again the excellence of Washington and Lee has been
singled out in a national publication. USA Today, that
newspaper (in)famous for its short news stories and colorful
weather map, has ranked our school as the 23rd most selec-
tive university in the nation.

This honor follows the ranking of W&L as the 25th best
liberal arts university in the nation by U.S. News and World
Report. While it is definitely good to see the prestige of the
university on the rise, everyone needs to realize something
important before they call home excitedly with the USA To-
day results.

The U.S. News ranking was the result of a survey of college
presidents across the nation. They were asked to name the
best universities, in their opinion, in a number of different
categories (liberal arts, pre-professional, etc.). This, in ef-
fect, is ranking by peers, one of the most telling types of
evaluation there is.

However, the USA Today list only took into account the
selectivity of any particular institution. This means the
paper took the number of people accepted to a particular col-
lege and divided by the number of applications received by
that college. While this gives people a general idea of a col-
lege’s worth, it can be misleading.

For any small school, W&L for example, the number of
people accepted will be naturally low. In order to raise the
ranking all the university needs to do is solicit large numbers
of applications and still accept the same number of people
per year.

This means that if W&L convinces large numbers of
students who have no chance of admission to apply, our
rating will go up.

Of course, it is still an honor to be recognized for outstan-
ding qualities, and selectivity is one of those. However, peo-
ple do need to realize that not all ranking systems are what
they seem to be.

Numbers do not gauge learning

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Solomon

 

It’s 10:30 p.m. on Thanksgiving
Day and I’ve stayed in Lexington
during this vacation, not because I’m
interested in doing a case study on
the quality control at Lloyds once the
students leave, but rather because I
felt I needed this time for several im-

pending papers. Yet as I sit at my -

desk I begin to think back on the
many times I’ve been in similar
situations, studying for great periods
of time and consuming vast amounts
of knowledge only to end up with a 73
on the exam.

Of course, after each experience

like this I would always ask myself

the same question. ‘Did you know
the material?” To which the usual
reply was, “Sure, I knew that stuff
backwards and forwards.”’

My point to all this is that making
grades for the sole point of getting
the grade is absurd. We are not here
to be assigned a number grade which
can be translated at the end of the
term into a letter grade. We are here
to learn. I feel myself constantly. be-
ing cfunched by grades. I deserve
better; we all deserve much more
than a rhetorical grading system.

Have you ever found yourself
thinking: Well, lets see if I can make
a perfect score on my next exam,
then maybe my final grade will be a
“B”’. “B” for what? Very good. Ah,
yes, I’m very good. God forbid I
should get a ‘‘C’”’ and be just average.
Can anyone tell me that I’m just
average? That everything I’ve learn-
ed is just average? That’s crazy.

I’m sure about how many of you

are asking why I’m writing this?
Well, if I had gotten a better grade on
my last test I probably wouldn’t be
writing this. But this is not just for
those people who are dissatisfied
with their grades, but for everyone at
this fine University. Don’t worry so
much about the numbers on a scale
or the letter assigned to you. If you
make a good grade and learn
nothing, then you have failed.

I’m not about to suggest any
radical changes in the grading
system here. We have all been told
how excellence stems from the obser-
vation of material and ability to
recall it at any given point in time.
This is why our teachers give us
quizzes and exams. But I believe it is
wrong to rank excellence at the top of
our objectives. Success should be at
the pinnacle of our minds. Being an
astute student does not involve a
number or letter. Being successful is
something that has to come from

within. You do not have to look at
your exam grade to feel successful.
You should know before looking at
the grade whether or not you have
been successful. Ask yourself if you
have learned anything. If you answer
“tyes” then I believe you have sur-
passed any letter or number grade
that could be given to you. You have
attained a sense of self-satisfaction.
Maybe this is all too idealistic. But
who can tell me that assigning a
number grade isn’t idealistic. A
number means nothing, it is just a
way of satisfying our need for ra-
tionality or realism. To me, that is
idealistic.

With the impending arrival of ex-
ams not far away I hope some of you
will think about this and possibly
learn something. Well, it is now after
11:00 so I better end this bit of per-
sonal testimony here, and start doing
some work so I can get an “A” on my
next paper.

Deferred Rush is not the right idea

To the Editors:

After reading Miss Reynold’s article in the
Ring-tum Phi on November 19 concerning the
faculty petition asking for a deferred rush, I am
only more convinced in my belief that the whole
question of rush is somehow getting into the
wrong hands. With all due respect, Mr. Sessions,
I really do not think that you know what you are
talking about and therefore should have no say in
our Rush calendar. Two of your observations in
particular led me to this conclusion.

First, if you had any inkling as to what the
situation in the dorms is you would realize that
there can be no “dorm parties” due to the dor-
mitory regulations. Parties in the dorms would
be unsafe at best as there is no room for parties,
and nobody would come in the first place as these
parties would have to be dry.

Freshmen as well as fraternity members
would find somewhere else to go and something
else to do. Secondly, you state that you “‘do not
think the fraternities can rush for an entire
twelve weeks because of the time and energy it
will take.” You have brought up an interesting
point here, but you have discarded it too quickly
which indicates to me your lack of understanding
toward the problem at hand. Fraternities will
rush for twelve weeks regardless of expense and
time. Your little plan for pushing deferred rush
on the students and thereby saving us
academically will only ruin some fraternities
financially and ruin many individuals first term
grades. I do not know if you have ever par-
ticipated in a fraternity rush, Mr. Sessions, but it
is a very important and intense process,
especially at W&L with the declining male
population. Rush is the most important thing to a
fraternity, and the members will rush for twelve
weeks regardless of rules.

I will admit, Mr. Sessions, that deferred rush is
a good idea in theory. However, my point is that
it will not work practically. Deferred rush will
hurt students’ academics and the fraternities
more than it will help them. Finally, how is the
question of rush any of your business anyway?
This is a student matter, and if anyone draws up
any proposals it should be students. I understand
that the Student Affairs Committee should
review any proposals, but it is still the students’
rush calendar. I will predict right now that if the
faculty shoves deferred rush down the throats of

the students we will have a rush bonanza of rule-
breaking and problems next year. You thought
this past Fall was bad, Mr. Sessions? Oh Boy! !

Check priorities

To the Editor:

A serious flaw in priorities has come to my at-
tention which deems further examination. The
flaw is that, in my view, the Administration of
Washington & Lee has placed greater priority in
the wants of themselves and the Board of
Trustees than in the needs of the students.

When I made the decision four years ago to at-
tend W&L, I did so in the belief that I would
receive one of the best educations available. I
find that for those interested in Computer
Science, this is not the case. This semester, the
supply of professors available to teach an entry
level computer course, Computer Science 110,
did not meet the demand. In fact, one professor
was left responsible for over 70 students in a
course which demands personal attention, with
programs due weekly. The task was obviously
too great for one man so he sought help in the
form of teaching assistants. But alas, this is
W&L and there have never been teaching
assistants here. So the Administration ruled that
teaching assistants are not to be, in any way,
substitutes for professors. Thus, this one pro-
fessor is again met with the task of instructing
over 70 students in a fashion conducive to each of
their personal understanding.

Meanwhile, plans for an Arts Center costing
millions of dollars are steaming full ahead.
Doesn’t it strike you as odd that while we do not
have enough professors to handle the load of
students in Computer Science, a quickly rising
major, we do have enough funds to build a center
for the world reknown artistic performers of
Washington and Lee?

Now do not misunderstand me, I’m not argu-
ing in favor of teaching assistants. I am arguing
for the proper attention to be given to students
whose families pay a great deal of money each
year in expectation that their son or daughter is
getting one of the best educations available. I ad-
dress the Administration: Are the needs of the

students being placed behind the wants of
— and the Board of Trustees? I invite a
reply.

Sincerely,
Etienne D. Cambon

What about AIDS?

To the Editor:

When will the President wake up to reality? He
continues to purchase another unneeded nuclear
weapon system of mass destruction, the B1
bomber at a final cost of more than $280 billion
dollars per plane. Meanwhile across the nation
and the world people are dying in a raging AIDS
epidemic.

Surely by canceling the B1, S.D.I. and other
unneeded nuclear weapon systems enough
money would be freed to find cures for AIDS,
most cancer, and probably feed and shelter the
homeless and still go a long way toward balanc-
ing the budget. The F.D.A. must wake up to
reality also. While people die of AIDS here in

-America, other AIDS sufferers are being saved

with AIDS drugs which the F.D.A. stubbornly
delays testing and approval of, not to mention
making it illegal to manufacture, prescribe and
possess them. The F.D.A. must wake up and
cease its anti-humane aids policy immediately.

The Supreme Court must wake up to reality
also and recognize that the true marriage bond is
the strong love and mutual sharing relationship
bond and not a piece of paper. It must recognize
this and the need to grant nothing less than full
human, civil and economic rights and
priviledges regardless of sexual preferences in
such relationships. I urge everyone to wake up
the President, Supreme Court, F.D.A. and Con-
gress by sending them copies of this letter or
part of a chain letter to everyones friends and
relatives so that they may do the same.

Let’s all do our part also and make a donation
toa AIDS charity also.

MY VIEW
By Kathy Morrison

For the benefit of you who are
wondering how to magnify the
pleasure of your stay here at
Washington and Lee, I wish to ex-
pound upon the superior standard of
domestic existence here in beautiful
downtown Lexington.

My roommate and I occupy a
quaint little two bedroom flat right on
Main Street. Life is fast-paced here,
with carriage rides passing below the
bedroom windows every morning at
ten, the late-night weekend rituals of
fraternity hoppers calling out ex-
huberantly to each other en route to
and from Red Square, and the heart-
stopping, action-packed
atmosphere—and delicious aroma—
of Lloyd’s right down the alley. Our

small neighborhood includes
students as well as more established
residents of Lexington, proof to the
fact that the university and the com-
munity really do work and play
together as one big, happy family.
But no matter how snug and com-
fortable I may be in my rustic little
abode, I can’t help but remember all
the good times I had back in the
dorms. Sometimes I really miss the
closeness, the warmth, the zany
shenanigans. Mostly, however, I feel
this odd empty feeling as I pause to
reflect upon all the sharing I’m miss-
ing out on, especially since I have on-
ly one roommate. I miss sharing
things like the bathroom, the
bedroom; sharing things like the
girls in Graham-Lees did last year. I
also sometimes envy those dorm oc-
cupants who are lucky enough to eat
in Evans dining hall every day, shar-
ing dinner, remnants of yesterday’s

dinner, and those yummy tidbits

destined to comprise tomorrows
lunch,
In spite of all the crazy fun

available to me in Lexington’s Main
Street night life, I must admit that I
find myself looking back longingly
upon all those exciting times back in
the dormitories. I now find it difficult
to truly enjoy a beer in my room
without that familiar, exhiliarating
thrill of punitive danger posed by the
Dorm Counselor. I even catch myself
heaving long sighs for lack of the
romantic adventure so abundant on
the co-ed floors: that frightening, yet
strangely exciting, possibility of run-
ning into a member of the opposite
sex as I dash from the shower to my
room, the thrill of being awakened at
some amazingly ungodly hour by

“dorm ragers’ as they bump
drunkenly down the halls, VMI
Cadets leaving erotic messages

The Ring-tum Phi, December 3, 1987

Dorm life never leaves you lonely

scrawled on all the doors—all these
adventures and more are lost to me
now that I've opted to live in town.
But even through this melancholy for
what-might-have-been, I chuckle to
myself as I think back on fire alarms
at three a.m., the neighbors whoop-
ing it up until the wee hours, the con-
struction on Gaines beginning every
weekday morning before the break of
day—all those happy, human noises
that make one feel so much at
home...

City life may be nice, but you never
have to feel alone when you live in the
dorms!

In short, no matter how one may
chogse to spend time in this booming
nest of activity, there is a place for
everyone. Town or dorm, relaxation
or adventure, private or public, Lex-
ington has it‘all—it’s all in the way
you look at it that counts.

Students take tests to help choose careers

 

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter
On Nov. 10 and Nov. 11, two

workshops were held by Dean
Schroer to assist students in inter-
preting the results of their vocational
and personality tests.

The first test, the Strong Voca-
tional Interest Inventory, was com-
posed of approximately 175 ques-
tions, partly true-false and partly
like-dislike, which help the person
taking the test figure out which type
of career best suits him/her.

 

From Staff Reports

 

Walkers and joggers using the
cross country trail behind the
Pavilion this fall have noticed some
wide open spaces in what was forme-
ly a dense pine forest.

The removal of approximately 30
acres of white pine trees was brought
about through an unfortunate com-
bination of natural circumstances,
according to Scott Beebe, assistant
superintendent of buildings and
grounds and director of projects at
W&L.

The pineforest, planted approx-
imately 25 years ago on what was
once a grassy knoll had grown too
dense, Beebe said. The problem was
exacerbated by an infestation of
aphids—insects that suck sap from
trees—and the recent drought.

‘What we had was a huge stand of
dead trees,” said Beebe, who is a
registered Christmas tree grower
and manages W&L’s Christmas tree
farm at Skylark. “It created a
tremendous fire hazard and the in-
sect infestation had reached the point
where it was threatening the en-
tire forest.”

After consulting with the Universi-
ty’s landscape architect firm, the
Virginia Division of Forestry, and
Westvaco, one of the nation’s largest

Kelly Shifflett — sophomore ‘‘The
Boneshakers. I just heard them last
weekend and they were great.”

 

The Myer-Briggs Personality Type
Indicator, a 50-multiple-choice ques-
tion test, does exactly what the name
says: it gives the taker a general idea
of what sort of personality he/she
has.

While the Vocational Interest test
has been around for sometime, the
Myers-Briggs test wasn’t introduced
to W&L until this year.

Schroer’s workshops are also new
to the school. She felt that such group
interpretations would be helpful to
those students taking the tests. Eight

manufacturers of paper and
pulpwood, the administration decid-
ed to engage in a process of forest
management.

“The areas we cut out were mostly
dead tress,’’ Beebe said. ‘‘We were
very careful about where we cut. A 50
to 100-foot buffer was left aroung the
edge of the trees from the pavilion to
the VMI property, and we left some
islands of healthy trees standing.
President [John D.] Wilson said he
did not want to be able to see the cuts
from the front campus.”’

Once the trees were cut, they were
sold for pulpwood. The debris that
was left behind will be pushed to the
center of the cut area. If conditions
permit, Beebe said, the debris will be
burned. If, because of dry conditions,
burning is not possible, the debris
will be left as a wildlife refuge for
birds and small game.

The area will then be replanted
with loblolly pine seedlings that
Beebe said will mature quickly.

“‘What it all comes down to is good
forest management,’ Beebe said.
“The trees we cut down were planted
with the idea that they would be
harvested in the future. If we do not
routinely cut down and thin out the
small and diseased trees, the whole
forest could suffer. The steps we
have taken will ensure the vitality of
the forest for generations to come.”

students participated in the career
test workshop, and six of those eight
returned the following afternoon for
the personality test workshop. In the
second one, Schroer related the
results of each test to each other.

The personality test is helpful for
students making career decisions
because, as Schroer said, ‘‘(they)
show students how they make deci-
sions...show them when they are and
aren't creative...they show how
logical or intuitive they may be.’’ She
added that the tests also helped show

students how they would work with
others by making them aware of
other pefsonality types.

Schroer especially recommends
the personality test for sophomores
who are trying to decide on a major.
She says many seniors have shown
interest in the vocational test to help
them decide which company to go
with, or what kind of job to start with
at that company.

The tests will be available all year.
Anyone interested should first con-
tact either Schroer or Dean Heatley
in the Career Development Office.

The Washington and Lee basketball team appeared to do everything right
when it won its Old Dominion Athletic Conference home opener Tuesday
night, and 87-85 victory over Hampden-Sydney in the Warner Center. The
Generals upped their early-season record to 4-0, one of the fastest starts for
the team in recent years, and the team played well down the stretch in
pressure situations. Appearances, however, can still be deceiving.

The Generals played a very uneven game, with the bright spots being ex-
cellent shooting and bench play. Turnovers were a problem, though, as W&L
had trouble establishing its half-court offense.

“We're trying to get an up-tempo game. We’re trying to get a transition
game,” said senior guard Steve Hancock,’ but we’re turning our transition
game into a fast-paced one and not setting up our offense. We’re mentally
tough as far as keeping the lead. We didn’t lose our cool, but we have to learn
to settle things down and work the ball under pressure.”

Hancock’s assessment echoed the feelings of his head coach. “The only
thing that was pleasing tonight was that we had contributions from the ben-
ch, like a guy like [senior center] Lou Trosch,’’ said head coach Verne Can-
field, ‘‘and we showed a mental toughness we haven’t showed the last couple
of years. But I am totally—underline totally—dissatisfied with our execution
at either end of the floor.”

Hancock and Trosch, this season’s co-captains, were both key performers
for W&L. Hancock led all General scorers with 22 points and Trosch came off
the bench to grab 11 rebounds, one of which was an important offensive
board that he put back in for two points. Trosch was thrust into action after
senior center Harmon Harden (16 points), the starting center for the
Generals, fouled out with over five minutes remaining.

The Generals led 36-32 at halftime. Scoring wise, Hancock received sup-

,port from freshman forward Ed Hart (13 points) and freshman guard
Michael Holton (11 peints, three 3-pointers).

Center. W&L travels on Saturday for a game against Lynchburg before

Athletic Department decided to
agree on an equally divided respon-
sibility being unanimously averse to
the idea of taking the matter to court,
considering that no one would really
win the case, said Parsons.

Meanwhile, the Athletic Depart-
ment decided not to build a field
hockey field, and instead requested
another soccer field. Since soccer
fields can be constructed with
crowns, the contractors did not have
to face the possibility of faulty soil
mixture again. According to Par-
sons, another advantage to the
reconstruction was the timing of the
decision. The University was cur-
rently building more parking space
for the Law School and could utilize
the remaining soil dug from that pro-
ject to expand an athletic field.

Parsons described the steps of cor-
rection: ‘‘We augmented the sand,
went through several procedures of
removing the soil compound, and
redesigned the sprinkler system.”’

Feelies to play W&L

  
   

 
 

ee
a By Gregory Ossi
Music Critic

 

 

Those crazy boys are at it again.
No this album is not the latest new
age music for yuppies from Japan,
nor does it involve slow, twanging
vibrations from (insert the name of
your favorite Chinese instrument
here.) Although you can be fooled by
the album’s cover of the two happiest
kelp fishermen I’ve ever seen.

This is the new album from the
Feelies, a highly nonconformist band
from Hoboken, New Jersey. Despite
the new name, Yung Wu, this is no
sidelight album from the Feelies. It
is a fully produced piece of the band
at its best, consistent with the quality
and originality of their last two
works. There is the folksy Feelies
sound of the dual and sometimes tre-
ble guitar playing of Glenn Mercer
and Bill Million, the impassioned
carefree voice of Dave Weckermen
and the beating of drums by Stanley
Demeski coming together to form
some hot tracks.

The album starts out with the title
song ‘‘Shore Leave.’’ A catchy tune
backed by a solid two-chord rythm by
the acoustic guitar filled in with a lit-
tle keyboards and electric guitar
riffs. The vocals are typical Feelies,
barely intelligible yet pleasant.
“Aspiration” the third song on the
first side is a contemplative song that

l LORIST rocks. The lyrics to the chorus go
i something like this; Till they
find/they can’t describe/in great
detail/the sight that fails/Aspiration,
its coming from the air/Inspiration,
it seeps from over. Alright, its not ex-
actly on the same philosophical plane
as U2 but this is a Feelies song and
lyrics aren’t that important. What is
important are those jangling guitars

and folksy upbeat melodies that tend
to stick in your head.

There are several excellent covers
on this album. On side one there is a
well-down cover of Brian Eno’s “Big
Day.’’ They do justice to the Stones
“Child of the Moon”’ on the flip side.
By far the most impressive cover is
that of Neil Young’s “powerfinger,’’
one he should be proud of.

I keep refering to this band as the
Feelies which they are, but on the
album they have called themselves
Yung Wu. I hope no one is terribly
confused. This is a takeoff from their
live shows in which they seem to en-
joy appearing under a different
name.

The second side rocks as much as
the first side. ‘Eternal Ice’”’ sounds a
little heavy with the electric sound
more so than the rest of the songs but
it is still a great tune. Both “Strange
Little Man” and ‘“‘Modern Farmer”’
have all the qualities of a good song
and more. ‘Return to Zion,” the
third song on the B-side, encontpases
and shows off the talent the band has
for creating a song that has a sort of
unforgettable lasting to it.

What are people saying about this
album? CMJ, the college magazine
of progresive music raves, ‘‘it seems
that no matter what these boys lay
down on wax, it has a timeless quali-
ty to it.’” WLUR has placed it high on
their play list.

This review can’t do the album or
the group proper justice. You can,
however, seem them live during
Christmas Weekend on Friday,
December 4 when they highlight a
three band show sponsored by the
SAB. The concert also features
Dumptruck and Tommy Keene.

Recruiters place requirements on seniors

 

By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

 

Although many W&L seniors are
gearing up for the all-important on
campus job recruiters’ interviews to
be conducted in two weeks, the
Career Development and Placement
Office is concerned that many
seniors are unaware of the re-
quirements job interviewers are
placing on them

“T have found that a group of
students who are unplaced each year
are people with grade-point averages
of 2.3 or lower. That nearly always is

the majority of the unplaced
students,”’ said Richard Heatley,

Co-editor

 

 

John D. Wilson, president of
Washington and Lee University, was
presented with the ‘‘Duffy Daugherty
Award” from Michigan State Univer-
sity on Nov. 25

The award’ named for the late
Hugh “Duffy” Daugherty, an MSU
football coach for 19 years, is

presented annually to an alumnus
who has distinguished himself on and
off the field

Wilson was given the award by
MSU teammate and athletic director
of MSU, Doug Weaver, at the annual
football banquet in East Lansing,
Mich.

“T was pleased [to receive the
award] because I admire Duffy,”
said Wilson. ‘‘He had a good sense of
humor and didn’t take himself too
seriously

“It gave me a chance to thank the
university for all it had done for me,”’
added Wilson

Wilson graduated from MSU in
1952. During his years at MSU, he
played defensive back for the Spar-
tans, who won the national cham-
pionship. He also was selected to play
in the North-South all-star game

Wilson was awarded the Western
Conference Medal for Scholarshin
and Athletic Prowess and the John A
Hannah Award for Distinction in
Academic and Athletic Achievement
He was also chosen to be on the first
Academic All-America football
team, which was selected in 1952.

Wilson attended Oxford Universi-
ty, where he earned an M.A., as a
Rhodes Scholar after graduating
from MSU

After serving in the U.S. Air Force
for two years, Wilson returned to
MSU to serve as assistant to the vice-

have not registered to make sure
they did,” said Heatley, ‘because
within a couple of wale major on-
campus recruitment will begin and if
they are not registered then they are
not qualified to have interviews on
campus.”’

Upon registration, students are
then allowed to sign up for interview
times with companies they are in-
terested in, so long as they meet the
requirements for each company.

Many of the companies interview-
ing at W&L in the upcoming weeks
require a minimum GPA of either 3.0
or 2.75, and several require a certain
amount of credit hours under specific
courses of study, as well as specific
majors.

Basketbal
to speak |

 

By Sean Bugg
Editorial Page Editor

The mother of Len Bias, a college
basketball star who died of a drug
overdose, will speak at W&L as part
of the Drug and Alcohol Awareness
Week.

Lonise Bias will give ‘A Challenge
to Students and Adults to Wage War
Against Drugs” Jan. 22 at 7 p.m. in
Lee Chapel.

Bias’s speech will conclude a week
of programs designed to heighten the
W&L community’s awareness of
drug and alcohol abuse.

The week, which begins Monday,
Jan. 18, is being sponsored by the
Student-Faculty Health Education
Committee, and is being coordinated
by Associate Dean of Students Anne
P. Schroer Lamont and University

Heatley said that currently
than 165 seniors were registered with
the Placement Office and therefore
able to participate in the on-campus
recruitment interviews

“We have had a very busy fall in
preparing students for this event, so
we have encouraged seniors to
register with us in the fall,” he said

Heatley said that about 30 percent
of the seniors do not register with the
Placement Office because they plan
on attending law or graduate school
However, Heatley said that they
should register to open themselves to
job resources after they graduate
from law or graduate schoo!

Heatley added that some seniors do
not realize that when companies

more

come to W&L to interview job can
didates, the companies are seeking to
fill a specific job and are not looking
to do general interviewing

“Students think that if a company
is represented on campus, that
whatever kind of position they would
want to apply for with that company
is what those interviews are for.”

The Placement Office held resume
writing and interviewing workshops
this week for students to improve
their resume-writing ability and see
themselves on videotaped inter
views. These workshops, which
Heatley said had very high turnouts,
will be continued throughout the
month

Secretary Carol Calkins

Speaking on Monday night will be
Sam Rutigliano, former coach of the
Cleveland Browns. His speech, ‘‘An
Ordinary Person Trying to Make a
Difference,”’ will begin at 7:30 in Lee

‘Chapel.

Two workshops will be conducted
by Bob Lynn, a member of the staff
of the Alcohol and Drug Treatment
Program at Lewis Hospital. Both are
scheduled for Thursday, Jan. 21.

The first workshop, ‘“Interven-
tion,” will begin at 3 p.m. in Northen
Auditorium. The workshop will help
people learn how to approach so-
meone who might have a drug or
alcohol problem and get them to
recognize it, said Calkins.

The second workshop will begin at
7:30 in Lee Chapel and refers to
adults who grew up with an alcoholic
in the family and; and how they have
learned to deal with the problem

said Calkins

Calkins said there will be displays
in the University Co-op, Bookstore
and library during the entire week
Handout materials will be available
in the Bookstore and library.

Two videotape programs will be
shown in the Student Health Center,
located in Gilliam Dormitory. They
will be shown during sick call hours,
as well as times requested by in-
dividual students.

Calkins said the committee is also
considering showing a slide program
from the Lexington Police Depart-
ment at the library display.

The Inter-fraternity Council and
Contact will be co-sponsoring one of
the speakers.

Trident, the W&L women’s
organization, may also sponsor a
video presentation and discussion
one night during the week, said
Calkins.

Fewer classes taken pass/fail

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

 

Though the rules for taking classes
pass/fail haven't changed recently,
the number of pass/fail applications
has dropped more than 40 percent in
the last five years.

The current policy allows students
with at least a sophomore standing to
take only one course pass/fail per
term. However, only 18 hours of
pass/fail credit may be used toward
degree requirements. This limits the
number of pass/fail courses a stu-
dent may take to6 terms.

A pass/fail course cannot be in the
student’s major and it may not be ap-
plied toward a general education re-
quirement. Courses taken pass/fail
do not receive grade points.

According to University Registrar

D. Scott Dittman, W&L only has a
few classes that can only be taken
pass/fail. The student must petition
the professor of the course he or she
wants to take pass/fail. Dittman said
the pass/fail status is left to the pro-
fessor’s discretion, not the
Registrar’s Office.

John W. Elrod, Dean of the College,
said the reason for offering pass/fail
courses was for students to try new
courses in areas they were not
familiar with.

According to the W&L 1987 Fact
Book, the number of students taking
courses pass/fail has dropped 44 per-
cent in the last five years. Dittman
said various reasons could account
for this decrease in figures. ‘Some
institutions accept a passing grade
and convert it to a ‘C’, even though
the student may have passed the
course with a ‘D-’,”’ he said. ‘Other
institutions want to see a letter grade
for a course.’ He said tougher

transfer standards could be why
fewer students are taking pass/fai
courses, Dittman said W&L accepts
pass/fail grades from other institu
tions without requiring a_ letter
grade.

As the number of pass/fail courses
has dropped, the failure rate in the
courses has also dropped from 10.2
percent in 1982 to 4.1 percent in 1987
Just speculating, Dittman gave
several possible reasons for the
lower failure rate in pass/fail
courses. He said, ‘‘Better students
could be one reason. Also, professors
might not be as tough when grading
in a pass/fail course or pass/fail
courses may not be very hard.”’

Whatever the reason for the
decrease in the number of students
taking pass/fail courses, Elrod said
“Tt worries me because it means that
fewer students are trying new
courses.”’

OPINION

New Year’s
Resolutions

Well, the new year has arrived, and we want to assure
everyone that the season for resolutions has not passed us by
unnoticed. In fact, The Ring-tum Phi has made its own list of
resolutions. These are resolutions we would like to see made
in the Washington and Lee community, as well as some
resolutions of our own.

To begin, we would like the administration to resolve to
complete the construction on Gaines Residence Hall as soon
as possible. Even though the living quarters are very nice,
many of the advertised amenities, such as the computer
room and the gatehouse, have yet to be finished. We realize
that construction was rushed in order to have the building
ready to house students this year, but many of them decided
to live in the residence because of the advantages they
believed they would receive. It is only fair that those students
living there should be able to make full use of a completed
building.

Another resolution the university could make it to improve
the parking situation as soon as possible. We have recently
written about this in the Phi, and it has been discussed in the
past years. However, the problem seems to be continually
swept under the rug. We could go on for years talking about
how bad the problem is. But until the university takes
definite action on the problem it will never be solved and we
will continue to have demolition-derby parking lots (i.e. the
Corral). It must be remembered that parking not only affects
the W&L community; it affects the entire city of Lexington.

 

Turning to student organizations, let’s begin with the In-
dependent Union. Our wish is that the IU would resolve to
become a major part of university life. As it stands now,
there is no real reason for anyone to join the IU. They do offer
a cold test file, but what else? Just allowing independents to
participate in some intramural sports competitions is not
enough. The IU needs to plan more events and come up with
more services to entice people to join, and therefore make
another option for students who do not wish to join frater-
nities (or Trident, for that matter).

Speaking of fraternities, they have a hard battle ahead of
them if they want to defeat the proposal for a deferred Rush.
As has been said before in the Phi, there are many problems
inherent in a deferred Rush system. However, there are a
number of positive factors also. Fraternities need to show the
positive aspects of the traditional W&L Rush system (held at
the beginning of the fall term). But to do this, the fraternities
need to resolve to conduct themselves honorably during the
traditional Rush. This is the only way they can combat defer-
red Rush at the present time. Of course, they have done so
badly in the past, they may never get the chance to prove
themselves.

We believe the Interfraternity Council should resolve to
continue its positive growth. The IFC has shown this year
that it can be a viable governmental organization for the
fraternity system. During the tough times for fraternities
this is extremely important. Hopefully when IFC election
time rolls around, fraternities will realize they need to keep
competent people in control of the organization.

Moving quickly along to Trident, we hope they resolve to
throw a formal function this year that is a little bit quieter
than last year’s Confettis. What a bash.

The Ring-tum Phi has a few of its own resolutions. We hope
we can keep them all (barring unforseen acts of God or
nature).

We resolve not to run our editorial policy again, at least in
the editorial column itself. For those of you who missed it
during its numerous appearances fall term, it can be found
easily in most back issues of the paper. The deadline for let-
ters to the editor is in the staff box below this column.

We resolve to put out a parody issue at some point in this
year, hopefully even better than last year’s. We’re not going
to tell you when, though. It’s a surprise.

We resolve to cover the news at Washington and Lee to the
best of our abilities, and present a paper of the highest possi-
ble quality. We’re working hard, and we’ll be working even
harder in the coming term.

One Phi editor would like to resolve to make the bath mat
1988’s hottest fashion item.

We know this list cannot be comprehensive. There are
many resolutions that need to be made. Of course, if anyone
happens to have a particular resolution that they think should
be made, write about it in a letter to the editor. No one will
ever know about it if you don’t tell them.

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

Attending college far away from
home is good because it offers the
student exposure to the many joys of
travel. The luckiest and most
qualified students will later be
rewarded with jobs which demand
daily travel. I will discuss airline
travel because it is usually the most
efficient as well as a universal mode
of travel. A more important reason
for “his choice is that I flew at
Christmas and Thanksgiving and
harbor bitter grudges toward the
airline industry.

Returning to college from my
home in Tampa, Fla., at Thanksgiv-
ing went fine until Atlanta, where my
one-hour layover slowly turned into a
three-hour layover. The plane was
overbooked and could not take off un-
til someone took the airline’s offer
(bribe) of $175, a hotel for the night,
anda flight to Roanoke the next day.

Unfortunately, no one was enticed
enough to accept the offer. The

airline officials refused to believe
this and stubbornly repeated their of-
fer, without further embellishments.
This impasse continued until the at-
tendant was too hoarse to continue
(2% hours). For reasons unknown—
probably the airline exterminated an
inconspicuous passenger—we finally
got off the ground.

I knew something was wrong when
we were still in the air 45 minutes
after the pilot announced that we
were landing. Later we were told that
the fog was too heavy and we were
being taken to a semi-inhabited area
of West Virginia. I quickly recogniz-
ed the fog explanation as a covéfup
for airline vengeance. Obviously, the
company officials were still upset
because no one would accept their of-
fer in Atlanta. If the plane contained
enough fuel they probably would
have created a reason for taking us to
Albuquerque. For example:

“This is the captain. We have just
been informed by the President of the
United States that someone must
pick up a box of Apple Jacks in Albu-
querque and take it to the White
House. It seems the delivery is essen-
tial to keeping Communism out of

Activism is not just

 

MY VIEW
By Margaret Pimblett

 

I have a small button which I
recently began wearing on my over-
coat. It’s not presumptuous, or highly
noticeable. It’s just a subtle orange
button about an inch in diameter.

You may be wondering how I ex-
pect to write an entire column about
one little button. I’m wondering that,
myself. Well, it’s not the physical
button itself that means anything, it’s
the message that is printed on it. My
button says, ‘‘A Day Without Human
Rights is like a Day Without Sun-
shine.”

That’s a simple enough sentiment,
but you’d be surprised at the reac-
tions I’ve received because of it.

A friend of mine saw my orange
button, read it, and said (somewhat
jokingly), ‘Oh, Margaret, you're
such a liberal activist.

Huh??!?

I thought liberal activists were the
people who went on the Great Peace
March across the United States last
year, leaving their jobs and their
families for months at a time to help
draw attention to the need for world
peace.

Liberal activists are the ones who
sit in front of the White House with
skull makeup on their faces pro-
testing the Reagan administration’s

Central American policies.

Liberal activists are the members
of Greenpeace who had their ship,
the Rainbow Warrior, destroyed in
the waters off the coast of New
Zealand because they were pro-
testing the nuclear practices of
France. That incident relusted in the
death of one crew member and the
birth of the slogan, ‘‘You Can’t Sink a
Rainbow.”

Even musicians can be liberal ac-
tivists. Little Steven van Zandt has
sung about the sanctuary movement
in North America, the plight of the
American Indian, and of course, the
situation in South Africa. Peter
Gabriel’s anthem to Steven Biko, the
South African human rights activist
who was killed in a South African jail
in 1977, has a brand-new video which
includes clips of the film ‘Cry
Freedom”’.

And who can ignore the popularity
of U2, the band whose songs express
such a respect for human rights.
Every teeny bopper in America
learns the words to the latest singles
off their album.

But would you call a college stu-
dent who wears a button a liberal ac-
tivist? Come on.

The collegiate activists are the one
like Amy Carter, who was arrested
for protesting CIA recrutitment on
the campus of Brown University.
Even if she did fail out of school
because she was spending so much
time protesting, at least she’s pro-

America, and we're the closest plane
to Albuquerque.”’

Since I hate flying so much I was
just glad to get on the ground—even
if it was in an unknown area of West
Virginia. The rest of the passengers,
on the other hand, had an “I don’t
care if Roanoke is in the middle of a
nuclear winter; land there now!’’ at-
titude.

By the time I reached Lexington it
was 4 o’clock in the morning. Later, I
was informed by leading mathemati-
cians that I could have walked from
Atlanta to Roanoke faster than it took
me to fly. This was an outrage! Peo-
ple only fly because it is efficient, not
for enjoyment. Those of you who
would argue that the Wright brothers
and similar lunatics flew for enjoy-
ment are forgetting that airplane
food had not yet been invented. But
these days all airlines have airplane
food which totally eliminates the
possibility that any species of animal
could enjoy flying.

Flying at Christmas also proved to
be quite a learning experience. At ex-
actly 7:02 the airline attendant in-
formed us that the previous depar-
ture time of 6:30 was being changed

bably satisfied with herself.

How about the young man at a
school elsewhere in the United States
(I think in California) who hung a
banner out of his dorm room window
that said, simply, ‘DIVEST’? He
was ordered by the school to remove
the expression of his opinion.

Then, of course, there were the
students at the University of Virginia
who built a shanty town on the Lawn
in front of the Rotunda.

Could we even imagine a group of
W&L students putting up shanties in-
front of the Colonnade? I doubt it.

We all know that Washington and
Lee is predominantly a conservative
campus. I haven’t seen any students
walking around with purple hair or
wearing outfits that would more like-
ly be found on the lead singer of a
band called ‘‘Crazed Thumbsuckers
from Hell’’.

But we do have some liberal
members of our student body, in-
cluding the members of the Young
Democrats. (In case you think this
column is becoming a plug for a
political party, guess again. I am not
a member of the Young Democrats. )

This column is becoming a plug for
interest and concern. Occassionally,
when I think about how my life would
be have been different had I chosen
not to attend Washington and Lee,
I wonder if I would have become an
activist in the style of the
Greenpeace members and Little
Steven.

Instead, I attend a school with im-

 

to 6:45. Obviously the airline had -
figured out a way to transcend time.
Not only did I realize that airline per-
sonnel speak a different language but
IT actually learned to translate it.

For instance, when an airline of-
ficial says ‘‘Your flight will depart as

soon as we finish loading a few suit- *

cases,’ he’s really saying ‘The
engine won’t start and the only
mechanic is on vacation.”’ If he says,
“We'll have you in the air as soon as

we finish up a little maintenance *

work,”’ he means, ‘‘We can’t locate
your plane, check back in six hours.”
Hopefully he’ll never say, ‘Your
plane will be landing shortly,’’’ but if
he does, he means, ‘‘We don’t have a
plane for your flight. I hope you have
a sleeping bag.”

Maybe I’m exaggerating a little.
With the exception of the airline los-
ing my luggage, Christmas flying
was not that bad. As a matter of fact I
owe tne airlines a lot. If they had not
lost my luggage last year when I in-
terviewed for college, I never would
have gotten into this school. At least I
had an excuse for my appearance.
Otherwise I would have been re-
jected immediately.

button

peccable academic standards, a
beautiful physical campus and
natural surroundings, a talented and
widely-respected faculty, and the
legacy of two Americans of integrity.

But W&L does not have a history of
student activism, and its students
may perhaps have missed a poten-
tially life-changing experience.

Could it be that Washington and
Lee University needs to develop
more of a humanitarian conscience?

There was an attempt last year, at
least. A group of students, law and
undergraduate, tried to form a
chapter of Amnesty International,
the human rights organization that-
tries to obtain the release of
prisoners of conscience. Does that
student group still exist? If not, does
at least the idea and hope survive of
forming some sort of group with
respect for human rights as its basis?

If we need a role model, we need
only look as far as the Law School for
Professor Gregory Stanton. He,
along with his wife, have been at-
tempting to rectify some of the
human rights violations in Kam-
puchea, the country formerly known
as Cambodia, where the regime of
Pol Pot was in power in the 1970s.

With that cause and Stanton’s suc-
cesses as inspirations, perhaps some
of the students of W&L can expand
their myopic viewpoint of the world
in which we live, and begin to do
more than just wear little orange but-
tons on our coats. Maybe.

Kimbrough wills gift to Austin Peay State University

 

From Staff Reports

Through a bequest of the late Dr.
Emory Kimbrough Jr., former head
of the W&L sociology department,
Austin Peay State University in Ten-
nessee has received the largest
private gift in its history.

Terms of the will specify that the
gift, which was in the approximate
sum of $485,000, is to be used to
establish scholarships in honor and
memory of Kimbrough’s parents,
Martha Beaumont Kimbrough of
Clarksville. Tenn.. and the late

Emory Sr., who served as president
of the First Trust and Savings Bank
which is now Sovran Bank.

According to APSU President
Robert O. Riggs, although Kim
brough’s primary interest was
sociology, he designated that the
scholarship established through his
bequest be for students in any field of
study, with the intent of attracting
academically talented students to
APSU. Riggs said, ‘‘It is particularly
meaningful that such a renowned
academician and _ distinguished
scholar would recognize the impor-
tance of Austin Peay to his
hometown. His magnanimous gift to
the university is indicative of his

Roanoke Comedy
Club sells laughs

 

By Alex Sutton
Staff Reporter

 

The Roanoke Comedy Club is a
joke.

Anda very good one at that.

Located in the Down the Hatch
Lounge at the Patrick Henry Hotel,
the club runs shows every Wednes-
day through Saturday night in front
of packed audiences who certainly
have found a good time.

Owner Jim Butler says the talent
at his club is excellent.

“Of course we're not going to get
the [Whoopi] Goldbergs, the [Robin]
Williams or the [Richard] Pryors
here,’’ Butler says, ‘‘but we are get-
ting that level right below them... the
comedians on their way up.”

“After all,’’ he says, ‘‘where do you
think all of those big names
started?”

Among the comedians who have
done their act at the Roanoke Com-
edy Club are Rosey O’Donnel,
Margaret Smith and Alfa Trivette.

Smith has appeared on a Home Box
Office comedy special while O’Don-
nell has appeared on T.V.’s Star
Search. Trivette has done spots in
both television and movies.

Butler says he books comedians
from all over the U.S. and Canada to
perform at his club.

On Wednesdays, however, he
doesn’t book anyone because it is
“Local Talent Night” at the club.

On this night people from the au-
dience are encouraged to come up on
stage and perform for five minutes.
Butler says the people who do come
up “have guts” because it is “‘not as
easy as everyone thinks.”’

And although the audience can

sometimes be tougher than usual on
the amatuers some of the talent that
comes up is a ‘“‘howl’’, according to
Butler.

The crowd is also very active on
the other nights when the 90-minute
shows can become ‘‘not filthy, but
pretty dirty”, according to Butler.

He says that “‘if the crowd is really
into it and gets the comics going, you
can expect the comebacks and in-
sults to start flying.’’ Butler says the
comics’ material is “‘phenomenal.”’

Although a person must be 21 years
old to order alchohol at the club,
Butler says all students from W&L
are welcome.

He explains that those underage
people in a party will be seated
together and will not be able to buy
alcohol. Butler points out that the ex-
ception to this rule is on Saturdays
and sometimes Fridays when no one
underage will be admitted.

The reason for this exclusion, ac-
cording to Butler, is because the
crowd on those nights is too big to ac-
comodate everybody.

Butler says that besides ac-
comodating all W&L students at this
club, he would also be willing to
organize some shows in Lexington.

“That is definitely possible and
could be worked out’’, says the
owner.

Butler explains that he could simp-
ly extend the booking calender of the
comedians performing at his club on
weekend, and send them up to W&L
during the week.

Shows at the Roanoke Comedy
Club begin at 8:30. There are addi-
tional shows at 11:00 on Fridays and
Saturdays. Admission is $4.00 on
Wednesday and Thursday, and $5.00
on Friday and Saturday. Butler sug-
gests calling for reservations.

VCU English professor

received honorable mention for the
Lenore Marshall Prize and has serv-

ed frequently as a judge for that
prize.

A native Virginian, Smith received
his B.A. with honors from the Univer-
sity of Virginia in 1965. He received
his master’s degree from Southern Il-
linois University and his Ph.D. with
honors from Ohio University in 1976.

Smith published his first book of
poetry, Bull Island, in 1970. Since
then, he has published numerous
books of poetry, a novel, and collec-
tions of essays. His most recent
books are Local Assays (essays)
(University of Illinois Press, 1985)
and The Roundhouse | oices: Selected
and New Poems (Harper & Row,
1985).

Smith is professor of English at
Virginia Commonwealth University,
where he has taught since 1982. His
visit to the Washington and Lee cam-
pus is sponsored by the Glasgow En-
dowment Program.

recognition.”

APSU Vice President Wendell H.
Gilbert said, ‘‘Kim and I remained
close over the years. It was a delight
during his visits to engage him in a
stimulating discussion. I always
learned something

‘He will be remembered for his in-
telligence. However, even more than
his brilliance, I miss his
thoughtfulness and kindness. He was
a truly good person.”’

At the time of his death on Jan. 8,
1987, Kimbrough was professor and
head of the department of sociology
and anthropology at W&L. Having
been named to Phi Beta Kappa, he
earned both his M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees from the University of North

Carolina at Chapel Hill.

He received his bachelor’s degree
in 1957 from Davidson College,
graduating cum laude. During his
graduate studies, he held Odum and
Woodrow Wilson fellowships.

Speaking of him, W&L President
John D. Wilson said, ‘‘He took a
special joy in his professional life; he
had a zestful appreciation for his
field and his students. Dr. Kim-
brough was a marvelous catalyst for
us all.”’

In addition to his mother, Kim-
brough is survived by his brother,
Ben Kimbrough of Clarksville,
retired vice chairman of the Com-
merce Union Corporation Board and

immediate past chairman of the AP-
SU Foundation. Austin Peay’s Col-
lege of Business is named in honor of
Ben Kimbrough.

During his tenure at W&L, Kim-
»rough served on various key univer-
sity committees and was published
often in such prestigious publications
as Social Forces, the Virginia Social
Science Journal and the Washington
and Lee Law Review.

In addition to serving as a visiting
professor at the University of North
Carolina, Hollins College and Chung
Chi College of the Chinese University
of Hong Kong, in recent years he par-
ticipated in seminars at Oxford
University in England.

Echoing the words of Wilson, an

obituary written by three ol niu-
brough’s colleagues, O. Kendall
White Jr., John McDaniel and David
Novack, and published in the Sum-
mer 1987 edition of The Southern
Sociologist, stated that he was an
outstanding professor striving
always to be ‘ ‘‘brilliant’’ and totally
dedicated to his students and his pro-
fession.

They wrote, “This past year was
probably one of the best in Emory’s
life. Students, past and present, were
acknowledging his contribution to
their lives; and his experience,
especially with his Chinese friends,
indicated that what he had chosen to
do in life had been done well and ap-
preciated.”’

Professor’s play opens in NYC

 

From Staff Reports

 

“The Last Resort,” the newest
play by W&L drama_ professor
Thomas J. Ziegler, opened recently
at the Triangle Theatre in New York
City. The play will run until Jan. 31.

The play is Ziegler’s third to be
professionally produced, joining
“The Ninth Step,’’ produced at the
Riverwest Theatre in New York in
1984, and ‘‘Strings,’’ produced in 1986
at the New City Theatre in Seattle.

A comedy/drama, “The Last
Resort” depicts the plight of six
elderly residents of the plush Sunset
Terrace Nursing Home on Long
Island, where calm and peaceful con-

ditions prevail, until the arrival of
Marjorie Kendrick.

Kendrick quickly realizes the
peaceful atmosphere of the nursing
home is maintained by the ad-
ministering of large doses of tran-
quilizers, barbituates and
painkillers. This practice is not
motivated by malice. It is simply
common nursing home eoonomics.
As a resident explains, ‘‘One little pill
can do the work of two or three
nurse’s aides.”’

When Kendrick envisions the re-
mainder of her life being spent in a
drug-induced coma, she prods the
other patients into action. The results
are a funny and moving testament of
courage, caring and a tenacious love
for life.

Ziegler’s play was inspired by the

‘Images of Africa’ coming

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Fine Arts Department is spon-
soring a show entitled ‘Images of
Africa”’ from Jan. 11 to Feb. 12 at du-
Pont Gallery

The show consists of six views of
Africa. One part deals with the
growth of cartographic knowledge of
Africa in European maps from the
16th to the 19th century and includes
maps of some of the most distinguish-
ed cartographers of the times.

A second part features artifacts
from the SaHelle, including masks,
cloth, tools, utensils, daggers and or-

naments. A third section focuses on
the culture of Ghana and neighboring
countries, displaying Ashanti
goldweights, cloth of the area, a
variety of pots and other artifacts il-
lustrating adaptive craftsmanship.

The fourth and fifth sections
highlight the Horn of Africa, with em-
phasis on traditional and modern ar-
tifacts.

The items on display come from
the collection of Winifred and Fred
Hadsel of Lexington and are based
primarily on their Foreign Service
tours of duty in Africa.

Of his nearly 30 years in the
American diplomatic service, Hadsel
spent 20 of them dealing with African

observations he made while visiting
an elderly relative in a nursing home.
The seeming lack of concern by
medical professionals who treat the
elderly led to research which reveal-
ed startling statistics. For example,
$100 million is spent in the U.S. each
year for drugs to tranquilize nursing
home patients, and approximately
30,000 residents die each year from
drug misuse.

Ziegler joined the W&L faculty in
1976 after teaching at the College of
the Virgin Islands and the University
of Toledo. He received his B.A. from
Lewis College and his master’s
degree from Northern Illinois. In ad-
dition to teaching courses in theatre
design, play production and
playwriting at W&L, he is the resi-
dent scene designer and playwright.

affairs. Serving in various posts in
Washington and abroad, he was am-
bassador to Somalia and then to
Ghana from 1969 to 1974. Hadsel was
director of the Marshall Foundation
for many years prior to his retire-
ment.

Mrs. Hadsel is the president of the
Rockbridge Historical Society and
formerly worked as a researcher and
writer for the Foreign Policy
Association and as a_ research
analyst for the State Department’s

scholarship

From Staff Reports

 

 

Washington and Lee has received a
grant of $100,000 to establish a
scholarship in honor of the late E.P.
Tatum Smith Jr. of Roanoke, Va
Smith was a 1950 graduate of the
W&L law school.

The scholarship, which is open to
undergraduate and law students, is
made possible by a grant from the
William H. Donner Foundation of
New York, Inc. The Donner Founda-
tion is named after William H. Don-
ner, industrialist and philanthropist,
who sought to maintain exceptional
standards in the fields of medicine,
Native American affairs, and U.S.-
Canadian relations.

A native of Galax, Smith attended
the U.S. Naval Academy. He receiv-
ed his law degree from W&L and a
master’s degree from George
Washington University.

“Washington and Lee is grateful to
the Donner Foundation for its
generous gift in honor of Tatum
Smith,’ said President John D.
Wilson. ‘‘Mr. Smith was a devoted
son of Washington and Lee. I am sure
he would take great pride in this
memorial.”

End of the world

The Washington and Lee Film
Society is pleased to announce the
presentation of The Sacrifice
(Sweden/USSR, 1986), directed by
Andrei Tarkovsky.

Screenings will be at 8:00 p.m.
on Friday, January 8, and Satur-
day, January 9, in Classroom ‘“‘A”’
in Lewis Hall. There is no charge

for admission. The film is in
Swedish, with English subtitles

In The Sacrifice We are
presented with the kind of hero
that has always interested direc-
tor Tarkovsky—a person under
moral or ethical pressure, al a
crisis that will either make him or
break him. Here, a man beset by
self-doubt trades his own life for
that of a world doomed by nuclear
annihilation.

This rich and complex parable
of the end of the world and
redemption was the exiled
Tarkovsky’s greatest artistic ac-
complishment, completed shortly
before his death one year ago. The
work is a wonder of stately nar-
rative and memorable imagery.
Superlative acting and beautifully
stark cinematography by Sven
Nykvist help to make The Sacrifice
a truly haunting film.

The W&L Film Society is very
proud to be able to present The
Sacrifice, and we hope you will
share our invitation with students
and friends.

Act important

Open tryouts for W&L’s winter
theatre production of ‘‘Six
Characters in Search of an
Author” by Luigi Pirandello will
be held on Friday, Jan. 8, at 3 and
7 p.m. in the theatre. The play is a
philosophic comedy based on the
conflict which arises when a
theatre company is confronted
during a rehersal by 6
“characters’’ looking for someone
to put them into a play. There are
parts for 9 men and 6 women; 1
boy and 1 girl. Production dates
are Feb. 5-10. Scripts are
available for perusal at the

Generals play host in W&L

Invitational this weekend

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

The W&L basketball team is much
like a classroom textbook: You have
to use it once in awhile or it will
gather a lot of dust.

The Generals, after a 27-day period
of inactivity, brushed off any
cobwebs that might have ac-
cumulated enroute to posting an 82-68
win over Buffalo St. Tuesday night in
the Warner Center.

“No, it wasn’t pretty,”’ said head
coach Verne Canfield, whose team
ran its record to 7-1, “but it wasn’t
surprising because we were tired.
You have to understand that we have
had an extremely long layoff.”

Canfield’s team was definitely no
beauty in the first 15 minutes of the
game. The Generals looked rusty and
slow, and Buffalo St. turned it into a
20-17 lead with hust over five minutes
left before intermission. But then
W&L got its legs back and blitzed the
Bengals for 12 straight points to take
a comfortable 29-20 halftime lead.

The Generals were led by the im-
pressive inside play of senior center
Harmon Harden, who scored 15 of his
game-high 22 points in the first half.
Harden was also impressive on the
defensive end, holding the three
centers for Buffalo St. to a combined
total of 15 points while denying
several passes into the post position.

Harden’s sudden emergence as an
inside force has been, to say the
least, a pleasant surprise. After
averaging 5.0 and 3.3 points per game
as a sophomore and junior respec-
tively, Harden is now averaging 15.3
a game.

“IT haven’t done any extensive
practicing on any one particular area
of my game,” said Harden. ‘The
main thing is that this is the first time

 

I’ve had the ball consistently passed
to me. It’s mainly because of the
guards. They have more confidence
in me and, as a result, I have more
confidence in myself.”

The nine-point lead was extended
to 13, 53-40, at the 10:15 mark of the
second half on a three-point shot by
freshman guard Mike Holton. The
Bengals, however, hung tough and
put together an 8-1 spurt that cut the
lead to six with just over eight
minutes remaining.

W&L answered with an 11-2 run,
capped off by another Holton three-
pointer and a no-look feed from
Holton to freshman forward Ed Hart
for a layup. That made the lead 15
and Canfield began clearing his
bench a couple minutes later.

Hart was the other big scorer for
the Generals, knocking in 18 points to
go along with his team-leading 11 re-
bounds. Senior guard Steve Hancock
contributed 10 points, while Holton
and junior guard Emmanuel Klump
added nine apiece.

HOOKSHOTS—Canfield was pleased
with the crowd turnout for Tuesday’s
game. “I really appreciate the
students coming out and supporting
our team,” said the 25-year head

The death of ‘‘Pistol’’ Pete Maravich is certainly a tragic event,

even more so for the true basketball fan. Maravich was a great
shooter, a creative passer and, most importantly, an electrifying
entertainer. Fans who saw Maravich play saw one of the best players
; to ever play the game and, more often then not, the ‘Pistol’, usually
made one play that wouldn’t let them forget that fact. But this column
is not about Maravich.

Maravich was white and, in the basketball world, this made him
even more popular. Racism is still very evident in today’s society (if
you don’t believe that then you are fooling yourself) and this racism is
what causes a phenomenon in basketball that we will call ‘“‘reverse
tokenism.”’

' Blacks are better basketball players than whites. This is a debatable
statement but I think history and the current state of basketball sup-
port it quite well. Accepting the superiority of blacks on the basketball
‘ court is difficult for white fans (I’m speaking generally here). Whites
still consider themselves to be superior human beings to blacks. As a

 

result, the media (which are predominantly white) tend to build up the
talents of the few whites that are good basketball players.

This issue came up during last year’s NBA playoffs when Dennis
Rodman and Isiah Thomas (who are black) of the Detroit Pistons
were quoted as saying that Larry Bird (who is white) of the Boston
Celtics wasn’t all that great a player. They continued by saying that
Bird was overrated and that,if he were black, he would be just another
“‘good’’ basketball player. Thomas would say later that he was joking

Reverse tokenism: Racism is
predominant in today’s sports

(Part one of a two-part series)

when he made the statement, but his joke brings up an interesting
question: Are good white players made better by a prejudiced media
and prejudiced fans because these same media and fans are worried
by the dominance of blacks in basketball? Or more simply: Are the
Larry Birds of basketball a product of reverse tokenism?

Take this example and chew on it for awhile. A few years ago, Chris
Mullin of St. Johns was named college basketball’s Player-of-the-
Year. It just so happened that an intimidating, dominating and future
NBA Hall-of-Fame center named Patrick Ewing was finishing up a
great career for Georgetown. Did Mullin win the award because he
was white? Of course he did. Mullin, for all his great ac-
complishments, is not in the same class as Ewing. He never will be.
But that’s the point. The media and public were hungry for a white
star. When they found him, he was suddenly raised from the plateau of
“good”’ on the talent mountain to the heights of ‘“‘great.”’

This is not to say that whites can’t play basketball. In my opinion,
Bird is the greatest and most complete ‘“‘player’’ (take note Abdul-
Jabbar and Chamberlain fans) to ever play the game up to this point in
time. Michael Jordan will have a lot to say about who’s the best ever
after he gets 10 years under his belt. Maravich was a great
player. So was Rick Barry, Jerry West, Bob Cousy and Bill Walton.
Looking at the current situation, I think Keven McHale of the Celtics is
an unstoppable force in the NBA and one of its best forwards.

But the reverse tokenism exists. Here’s another example. In
Playboy’s pre-season All-American picks, Eric Leckner of Wyoming
(a good white center) and Rony Seikaly of Syracuse (another good
white center) were selected over J.R. Reid of North Carolina.
Granted, Playboy is not exactly the gospel when it comes to college
hoops, but even this magazine should be able to see that Reid is far and
away the best center in the nation. And how about the case of Rex-
Chapman of Kentucky? Chapman has been touted by several ‘ex
perts’’ as being an All-American. Puuhlease. | can name four guards
(David Rivers of Notre Dame, Vernon Maxwell of Florida, Gary
Grant of Michigan and Hersey Hawkins of Bradley) that
outclass Chapman is EVERY single aspect of the game. Let's face it.
Chapman is not that good. He forces bad shots, is not a great passer,

becomes impatient when he doesn’t score early and he gets most of his
20 points per game shooting free throws down the stretch (he is a good
free-throw shooter). He’s not even that great a shooter from the out-
side (he should take lessons from Rivers in this department).

But he’s white. He can jump out of the building. He can slam dunk
like a black player. Chapman’s so-called greatness is a product of the
reverse tokenism phenomenon. And this phenomenon is not just
limited to the realm of basketball. Gerry Cooney of recent boxing
fame was the white racist’s dream. Finally, whites would have so-
meone who could allay their fears by beating up a black man. What
they all failed to realize was that Cooney had no chance. The skills and
talent were not there. He was overmatched against Larry Holmes in
his first title fight and he was overmatched against Michael Spinks in
his second. But he was white and for a brief fleeting moment he had an
opportunity to make a white mark in a black-dominated sport.

The reverse tokenism phenomenon is something that needs to be
done away with. Let’s judge players soley on their ability to play the
game, not on ability and the color of their skin. It’s a shame when a

player like Jeff Grayer (a great black player) at Iowa State doesn’t
receive the recognition he deserves. Let’s stop fooling ourselves.

NEXT WEEK: Stereotypes in football and baseball

NOTES—Auburn head coach Pat Dye had no business calling for a
field goal in the final seconds to tie (notice the rhyme with Dye)
Syracuse. He cheated the fans, the media and, worst of all, the players
on both sides of the field. Winners go for the win. Losers go for not los-
ing... I don’t know about you, but I was sickened by the display (or lack
thereof) of sportsmanship in the Orange Bowl. Celebrating a good play
is one thing, but pointing, pushing and getting in the opponent’s face,
especially after every play, is another...

The Ring-tum Phi, January 7, 1988

 

 

By Gary McCullough
Movie Critic

 

For most avid movie-goers,
Christmas break was probably a
time to emerge from the shell of
Lexington into the real world of
film. While this holiday season
brought us a few disappointments,
there were at least two titans at
the theatres that will be well
remembered when the Academy
Awards come around.

Oliver Stone directed Wall
Street, Which stars Charlie Sheen
as an ambitious young  stock-
broker who, with great per.
sistence, is able to bring in one of
New York’s wealthiest corporate
hoarders, played by Michael
Douglas, as a client. Sheen gets
the ball rolling with Douglas by
leaking some information on Blue
Star Airlines that he receives
from his father, who is played by
none other than his father Martin
Sheen. Daryl Hannah, whose re-
cent movies include Splash, Legal
Kagles, and Roxanne, becomes
romantically involved with
Charlie Sheen while maintaining
her secret relationship with
Michael Douglas.

 

Wall Street seems to be a fairly
accurate portrayal of the transac
tions that can occur within the
stock market, as it stresses the
progressive idea that “greed
pays.’ The film shows us that *‘in-
side informaton” obtained illegal
ly is indeed a part of Wall Street
today, but while small-scale tran-
sactions may go unnoticed, the
major takeovers usually will not

This is Michael Douglas's se-
cond leading role this year.Fatal
{ttraction, his earlier film, cer-
tainly shocked the nation with a
cold touch of reality, and Wall
Street has a similar effect on a less
startling scale. Both movies
should find nominations for the
Academy Awards, and Michael
Douglas, needless to say, will be a
candidate for Best Actor in either
film.

Douglas’s two most recent hits
prior to 1987 wereRemancing the
Stone and its sequel Jewel of the
Vile, which he also produced. Ina
recent interview, he confessed
that he has always been hesitant
about going after the really
serious roles for fear that he
might be seen as merely an imita-
tion of his father. Kirk Douglas is
known for many powerful roles in

Wall St. & Broadcast News

Tough Guys. Michael's role in
Fatal Attraction really turned
things around for him.

Another top candidate for Best
Film will be Broadcast News. This
film, directed by James Brooks,
stars William Hurt as a snarp-
looking and not-so-bright
gentleman whose only possible
career could be, of course, that of
a television network anchorman.
The film also stars Holly Hunter,
ofRaising 1irizona, aS a producer
and Albert Brooks, of Lost in
imerica, aS a reporter.

All three characters are very
well-developed, and the plot
thickens around their close rela-
tionships.

This is the first time I have seen
a movie and known, within the
first 10 minutes, that I could not be
satisfied with any ending it had to
offer. A confusion exists @n the
relationships of these characters
that lies almost completely within
the characters themselves, and
leaves little room for better sug-
gestions from the viewcr. After a
two-hour wait for the typical

“happy ending” found in most
love stories, I was very pleasantly
surprised to find no such thing.

After starring in such classic

are best

films as Eyewitness, tltered States,
and Body Heat, William Hurt has
received high praise from the
Academy. He was nominated for
Best Supporting Actor for The Big
Chill, won Best Actor forAiss of the
Spider Woman, and was robbed of
Best Actor for Children of a Lesser
God. Hurt has always been an ac-
tor who attracts movies with a lot
of class and will certainly be
recognized again for Broadcast
News.

Fatal Attraction, Wall Street,
andBroadcast News were three of
the very best films last year, and
provided us with something we
just don’t find enough of in the
theatre: a comforting sense of
reality (Fatal Attraction being less
comforting than the others). The
latter two, especially, provide no
frills in the end and seek no
beautiful solutions to unfortunate
circumstances in the world. These
films are real. While cute and fun-
ny movies such as Planes, Trains,
and Automobiles and Three Men
and a Baby have provided most of
us with great entertainment, such
delightful fantasies and perfect
love stories will find ‘‘no room in
the inn’’ at the Academy Award
ceremonies for 1987.

Eddie Murphy’s new film is so Raw

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Eddie Murphy had quite a year in
1987. He was heralded as the top com-
edian in the nation, his summer hit

sequel ‘Beverly Hills Cop II” took
top honors as the highest grossing
movie of the year, and he finished the
year with a new concert film in the
theatres. Murphy had quite a year.
He should be thankful that he didn’t

start the year the way he ended it.

Murphy’s new concert film ‘“‘Raw”’
was one of the most highly an-
ticipated films released during the
Christmas season and by far the
most disappointing. Oh sure, all the
Murphy trademarks are there: the
tight leather outfit, the laugh, the
jokes about Italians, homosexuals,
and white people in general, and of
eourse the Cursefest style that is
synonomous with Murphy’s standup
(423 curses in 90 minutes - Yes I
counted!) but even they cannot save
this film.

“Raw” revives some of Murphy’s
most memorable characters but
even they can’t help. Murphy does
short impersonations of Mr. T, Bill
Cosby, a short Italian so charged
after seeing ‘Rocky IV” that he
challenges a 6’5’’ black man to a

fight, and a phone call with his drunk

father that are really quite funny.
Perhaps Murphy’s downfall comes in
not spending enough time with these
characters.

Murphy spends the bulk of “‘Raw”’
talking about love, his near mar-
riage, and how his girlfriend was go-
ing to take him to the cleaners in the
subsequent divorce. Some of this is
relatively funny, but it is far from
Murphy’s best work. Since Murphy’s
idea of love is strictly carnal the
routine becomes tiresome very
quickly and you start to count how
many times he can say the ‘‘F-word”’
in the span of one minute.

For those of you who think Eddie
Murphy is absolutely the funniest
man alive you might enjoy “Raw.”
The film is o.k. but compared to Mur-
phy’s last concert film “Delirious”
it’s not even close. I’m ony sorry that
Murphy didn’t make the entire film
as funny as the last fifteen minutes
where he impersonates his father
talking about when he was younger
and the family had to wear and eat
toys because Eddie’s grandfather
worked at the Coleco toy factory and
they were too poor to afford clothes
and food. This section of the film is
priceless, but the rest is disappoin-
ting.

University issues new standards for frats

 

By David Emrich
Co-Editor

 

As part of its fraternity renaissance
program W&L has published a set of
standards all fraternities must meet.
The Washington and Lee Standards
for Fraternities were introduced in
October after a year and a half of
preparation.

According to Associate Dean of
Students Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins,
the goal of the new standards is ‘‘to
make sure that the fraternities at W&L

* are providing what they should be

providing—which is a quality of life in
an environment that doesn’t detract

* from the academic community and

environment.

“In fact, it should add to it, primar-
ily by providing a social life, and pro-
, Viding a social life in an environment

that would be an asset rather than a de-
triment to the reputation of the whole
community and to the whole universi-
ty.

‘‘The intention is not just to fix up
the houses physically but also to fix up
the fraternities spiritually.’

Toward that end the standards were
developed over the past year and a
half by the Alumni Fraternity Coun-
cil.

The standards, according to the
document's preamble, are intended to
‘give direction and support to those
entities crucial to and responsible for
the vitality of the fraternity system.’’
The preamble goes on to name the six
“‘entities’’ as the University, the
national fraternity, the Interfraternity
Council, the house corporation, the
local chapter and the chapter house.

The standard themselves are organ-
ized into six sections corresponding to
the six entities. Each section spells out

the requirements each particular entity
must observe.

According to the preamble, ‘“These
standards...are not to be construed as
optional guidelines, but rather as
reasonable requirements necessary for
the local chapters to realize the Uni-
versity’s expectations enumerated in
the Board’s ‘Statement Relating to
Fraternities’: Chapters...are expected
to maintain adequately the physical
appearance of the fraternity property
and to assure the structural integrity
of chapter houses. Chapter members
are expected to conform to standards
of gentlemanly conduct and to exhibit
a concern for the rights and sensibili-
ties of others.”’

Five of the six sections of the guide-
lines are ‘‘in effect now,’’ said At-
kins. The sixth section, the part cover-
ing the chapter house, is not.

IBM and Waxing Poetics
‘to play Superdance ’88

 

By Christie Champlin
* Staff Reporter

 

« The two bands slated for this year’s
Superdance are Waxing Poetics and
“IBM. The dance begins Saturday,
» Feb. 6 at 11 a.m. and continues until
Sunday at | a.m. Waxing Poetics will
" play Saturday at 9 p.m., followed by
» [BMat 11 p.m.
Saturday afternoon will include a
battle of the bands with local bands
«performing. Negotiations to de-
, termine which bands will play are still
* underway as progress continues in the
r planning of this annual fund raiser.
_ Prizes will be awarded in three
categovies this year: highest total do-
‘nation raised, which will receive the
,grand prize; highest cash donation
"raised and highest donation for a
+single organization or fraternity. The
grand prize will be to “someplace
warm for five days and four nights,”’
‘according to Chuck Husting, one of
,the three co-chairmen of the Super-
dance Committee, which has about
*100 student members. The final de-
,tails of the prize are still being worked
out by the Prize Committee, headed

by Debbie Hurtt and Dave Weaver.
Other prizes, said Husting, include
weekends at the Greenbriar, Wil-
liamsburg, and Hotel Roanoke as well
as ski passes for Massanutten and the
Homestead.

Last year more than $25,000 was
raised by the event, which is in its
10th year at W&L. This was the
highest per capita amount raised by
any college or university in the United
States. W&L ranKed second to Syra-
cuse University in the total amount
raised.

Fraternities play a large part in the
Superdance according to Wright Led-
better, the head of. the Fraternities
Committee. ‘‘Fraternities usually ge-
nerate one third of our goal because
they are such a big student organiza-
tion and because of a lot of pledges
and a lot of houses which encourage
students to dance. This year we hope
to get at least as much participation as
in the past,’’ said Ledbetter.

Fraternities contribute in two ways.
They encourage their pledges to
dance, which raises at least $100 per
pledge, and they make separate dona-
tions. ‘‘We would like to encourage
each fraternity to increase its donation

by one dollar per member,’’ said Led-
better adding, ‘‘we really appreciate
what they do and the money that they
donate which’ ultimately goes to a
good cause.’’ Last year more than half
of the houses on campus pledged $200
or above.

To date the pledge classes of Phi
Delta Theta, Kappa Alpha, Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Phi Kappa
Sigma, Beta Theta Pi, and Pi Kappa
Alpha have agreed to dance. Lambda
Chi Alpha has at least five pledges and
Sigma Phi Epsilon has at least six
pledges who’ve agreed to dance. Phi
Kappa Psi has a national obligation
which will prevent them from danc-
ing.

**Byery fraternity odcrtibiies in-its
own way,’’ stated Ledbetter. ‘‘As
many chances a fraternity has to do a
good deed helps not only with the pub-
lic image of the fraternity, but also the
overall image,’’ he added.

The Special Events Committee, co-
chaired by Kathy Kelso, has organized
three slave auctions at area women’s
colleges and is also organizing pie
throws to be held during the break be-

‘Two seniors present papers

4

«By Stephanie Guittard
Staff Reporter

 

, Senior anthropology majors John

Metz and William O’Brien presented
*papers at a recent annual meeting of
,the Archaeological Society of Vir-
ginia.

Metz’s paper was titled ‘‘Problems
sin Assessing Structure Function: Ex-
ploring Artifact Distribution at Struc-
ture I of the Liberty Hall Academy
Site Complex.’’ It was co-written with
Kurt Russ, research archaeologist at
"W&L, and John McDaniel, professor
sof anthropology at W&L.

The research for this paper resulted
in the identification of an early frame
schoolhouse located on Mulberry
Hill. The schoolhouse was used prior
‘to the construction of the limestone
sacademy building, of which two walls
are still standing.

"The site was exacavated in 1976 and
11977. It lies behind the baseball field.
The data from these excavations is
Stored in a computer and handwritten
in catalogued forms. Nine structures
have been uncovered, and the depart-
‘ment is collecting the data and present-
ing a paper on each one in turn.
: Metz became involved with the

project through the anthroplogy de-
partment.

“I’ve been working for the an-
thropology department since I was a
freshman on the Liberty Hall project,
and they are putting together a final
site report and they needed labor

scholars to work on this,’’ Metz
stated.

O’Brien’s paper was titled ‘‘What
Do Springhouses ‘Look Like’ Ar-

chaeologically? Defining Material
Culture Patterning at a Late
18th-through 20th-Century Spring-
house from the Valley of Virginia.”’

The paper was also co-written with
Russ and McDaniel. It described the
excavations conducted at the Liberty
Hall Academy springhouse, and com-
pared the data to that of other spring
houses of the same period in the val-
ley. It also provided information on
how springhouses functioned within
the context of domestic sites.

“It was a paper that had to be
done,”’ O’Brien stated. ‘‘I was speci-
fically interested in what the springh-
ouse looked like archaeologically. By
that I mean analyzing the material we
found to see what the pattern was.”’

McDaniel is a memtber of the Ar-
chaeological Society of Virginia,
which is a professional organization of

archaeologists. Annually they meet to
present papers on their projects, their
findings, and the techniques they used
in the research.

Both of the seniors think their
papers were well received.

“It was the first chance I had to
really present a scholarly work in
front of a group, and the experience of
making that kind of public presen-
tation was just tremendous,’’ O’Brien
said. ‘‘It’s a difficult thing, but when
it’s all done it’s very rewarding.”

ted to be in compliance with [the first
five standard] by the first of next Sep-
tember... The principal thing that [the
individual chapters]have to to do is
either develop or revise their by-laws
so that they put them in compliance
with what’s required [by the stan-
dards.] And that they then enforce
those by-laws... and be able to docu-
ment that that’s how they’re operating
their affairs.””

According to the standards, each
chapter’s by-laws must define the du-
ties and responsibilities of all chapter
officers, establish parietal regulations
for residents of the chapter house in
accord with the IFC and the Student
Affairs Committee, prohibit illegal
drugs, provide for regular cleaning
and maintenance of the chapter house,
set guidelines for responsible alcohol
use, require that all members ‘‘behave
as gentlemen’’ and have strict enfor-

cement policies for all the above regu-
lations.

Said Atkins, ‘‘We’re not going to
have a situation where we’ ve got 10 or
12 houses that are in great shape and
everybody’s doing what they’re sup-
posed to do and things are running the
way they’re supposed to run and have
four or five or six others hanging
around on the fringe waiting to self-
destruct.

‘*That’s not intended to be a threat.
It’s just a simple statement that the
standards are set and people are going
to have to get up to them and stay
there in order to survive.

‘‘There’s nothing unreasonable in
those standards. In fact, ...not com-
plying with [the standards] would
probably cause a chapter to fail even-
tually on their own without the Uni-
versity withdrawing any recognition
anyway.”

 

WTP

Although the renovation of the
chapter houses is not the only part of
the overall renaissance, it certainly is
a large part.

Said Atkins, ‘‘Basically what we
want to get out of that is to have all of
our fraternity houses on a standard
pretty close to what the [Phi Gamma
Delta] house is ... basically a brand
new fraternity.’’

The renovation program is ‘‘geared
toward putting all of our fraternity
houses in the condition where they
would have another 50 years of useful
life as really quality places to live and
quality places to have parties,’’ said
Atkins.

However, said Atkins, before a
fraternity can be considered for reno-
vation, it must be in compliance with
the first five parts of the code.

With the division into two groups, the
club is kept on a more personal level.
Furthermore, the cadets have an ad-
ded incentive that is not purely
money-based.

Cadets must compete for positions
in the club and take a test. After the
selection process is furnished, Tatar
teaches the cadets how to use the Dow
Jones Data bases to receive and ana-
lyze information about the various
stocks. Once they have learned to ma-
nipulate the computer data, Tatar
gives them no assistance except as a
technical advisor.

According to Tatar, ‘‘Once they

start in, that money is theirs and they
run it totally by themselves.’’ The
cadets are left with the responsibility
of conducting all their own research
and calling their stockbroker at Scott
& Stringfellow in Richmond.

At about every weekly meeting, a
committee makes a presentation for a
stock and tries to convince the other
members to vote for the purchase of
that stock. In the meetings, ‘‘they pick
on each other,’’ says Tatar. ‘*That’s
all part of the process. You’re held
accountable for a real monetary de-
cision.”’

had to face the rest of the group when
the shares that he bought at approxi-
mately $18 dropped down to $7 as a
result of the stock market crash.

When the stock market crashed, the
cadets’ losses were lower than the
Standard and Poor 500. One group
currently has $90,000 invested which
is down 10 percent; the other group is
only down 7 percent with $93,000 to
invest. The SNP is down 18 to 20 per-
cent.

three-day all expense-paid seminar
sponsored by Princeton University’s
Foundation for Student Communica-
tion. Among the participants was
W&L senior Mike Henry.

The conference’s strength came
from the opportunity for students to
interact with each other and with
professionals from the business
world. Henry commented on the suc-
cess of the group workshops and in-
formal discussions concerning such
current issues as drug testing.

Business and government leaders
brought society’s and the economy’s
problems closer to the students’ pers-
pective by discussing corporate Amer-
ica’s problems and what situations col-
lege students will soon face. Alan
Bloom, author of The Closing of the
American Mind, spoke about his view

of the increasing trend among Ameri-
can college students to keep them-
selves from a broad exposure to nu-
merous subjects. He emphasized the
benefits of a liberal arts education and
knowledge of the classics in today’s
society. He feels that an education
which overemphasizes certain sub-
jects hinders a youth in realizing what
1s Important.

The students also benefitted from
the opportunity to get advice from the
top executives about various fields of
business. There was time for students’
individual questions about approach-
ing the job market after college.

The conference brought together a
diverse group of college and corporate
leaders to address what is going on
now and to consider what can be done
in the future.

in the stock market

its fourth year, over 90 cadets tried
out for 20 slots.

A few of the companies the cadets
have bought stock in are Dow Jones,
U.S. Steel, Squibb, and Dow Chemi-
cals. At the end of the year, the cadets
will sell their portfolio and give the
profit back to the VMI Foundation.
Over the past 3 years, the cadets have
earned over $120,000 in profit. Each
year the investment group starts fresh
with a $200,000 endowment.

Tatar said he became the cadets’
advisor because he’s ‘‘always had a
fascination with the market,’’ and be
cause he has a degree in finance. He
stresses that the cadets’ experience is
important because it ‘‘adds another
dimension to the classroom.’

He continued, ‘* You see the Federal
Reserve increase the interest rates,
and you see the stock market crash.
Suddenly, you see what is happening
not just as a classroom discussion.
You're actually holding a position and
having it affect you. That’s where the
real advantage to this process is.”’

**We're not training [the cadets] to
be stockbrokers. [The experience]
helps them to get jobs with the tele-
phone company. It’s a real help in
finding jobs,’’ claims Tatar.

Apparently, the cadet investors who
have graduated are still investing and
playing the market on their own. Says
Tatar, ‘‘I get letters from them all the
time about what they’re doing and
what they’re investing in.’

OPINION

 

Be aware

The upcoming week will be a very important one for the Wash-
ington and Lee community. Drug and alcohol awareness week be-
gins Monday, featuring a schedule of presentations, including a
speech by Len Bias’s mother, and displays. We believe is important
for every student to take the time to understand what is being pre-
sented.

We do not believe that W&L should have a Carrie Nation atti-
tude and raid every fraternity party serving alcohol. We do not
even believe the current legal drinking age is correct (18 as the legal
age would seem much fairer in many ways).

However, we do believe that people who are going to drink or use
drugs should be well aware of the consequences. With the news of
drug and alcohol-related deaths surrounding us, everyone should
realize their actions do affect others.

We urge students not to view the week as being a prod toward
total abstinence. Instead, view the week as an opportunity to learn,
so informed choices can be made. Knowing what one is doing is the
first step in becoming a responsible adult, which is supposed to be
one of the functions of college.

So don’t view the awareness week with disdain. Instead look at it
as an opportunity.

(The Ring-tum Phi would like to note that the opinion expressed
in this column may not reflect the opinions of the Student-Faculty
Health Education Committee, which is sponsoring the event.)

Write in

Perhaps some readers have noticed that there have been virtually
no letters to the editor printed in the past few issues, in fact the en-
tire year so far. Some may ask why this is.

It is certainly not because we’re not printing those we receive. In
fact, it’s our policy to run every letter space permits (and barring
any obscenities). We like to print letters, purely because it’s the
easiest way for members of the school to express their opinion pub-
licly.

Sadly, however, we just have not been receiving letters this year.
Is this because everyone thinks they won’t be printed? Or is it be-
cause too many people think their opinion won’t make a difference?

Either way, the situation is unfortunate. In most newspapers the
letters column serves an important function, letting readers know
what people think about certain issues and events going on around
them. In addition to editorials, columns and cartoons, letters help
the reader better understand the world.

Students, faculty and administration all need to know what the
general feeling on campus is. The letters column is a perfect way
for all these groups become informed. But until members of these
groups take an interest in submitting their opinions, they will con-
tinue to operate in the dark.

So send in your opinion. Otherwise no one will ever make a
difference.

Belted in

In case everyone doesn’t know it yet, there is a new law in the
state of Virginia, requiring everyone to wear seatbelts when in an
automobile.

The law provides that police officers cannot stop motorists for not
wearing a seatbelt. However, anyone who is pulled over for another
offense, such as speeding, can be fined for a seatbelt violation.

Now, it is perfectly arguable to say the government has no right
to force people to wear the belts. If concern for safety of citizens is
the basis for forcing people to protect themselves, what will be out-
lawed next? Parachuting? Smoking cigarettes in private? Walking
on icy sidewalks?

Obviously, many everyday activities of citizen involve some ele-
ment of danger, either long or short term. Although it is commen-
dable for the government to help protect the innocent citizen from
the harmful action of others (drunk drivers, for example), it is de-
plorable for the government to try to protect individuals from them-
selves.

In a ‘‘free’’ society, freedom of individual choice is paramount.
People should have this freedom to the extent that they do not in-
fringe upon the rights of others.

However, the new seatbelt law is in effect, so we advise students
to pay attention to it.

Selling
books

shatters

ideals

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

 

Try to imagine me the last week
of last semester.

(Important note: You will probably
encounter difficulty in doing this since
a college atmosphere tends to discour-
age the use of the imagination. I
suggest that you pretend you are in
high school where you depended heav-
ily on your imagination for a neces-
sary amount of daydreaming (4 to 6
hours). If this does not work drop out
immediately).

I have just taken my last exam. Now
I am walking to the bookstore to sell
my books. My contented state of mind
borders on euphoria. Looking down at
my heavy load of books, I suddenly
think of my father; what sacrifice. Be-
sides mortgaging the house and selling
his car, he took a night job so that I
could have these books.

Thinking about how much they cost
makes me nauseous, but my euphoric
state soon returns when I remember
how much I will get back by selling
them. Probably, I could retire on the
interest alone. This blind idealism was
soon to be shattered. . ‘

When I walked into the bookstore, I
saw him. Yes, with my very own
eyes, I saw that money-wielding de-
mon whose propensity for evil is mat-
ched only by merciless dictators and
Sunday morning evangelists. For lack
of a better term I will call him the
‘*Book Man. ‘* Without even blinking,
the Book Man turned the retirement
fund I expected into a meal at the Co-
op and a trip to the laundromat.

Luckily, I just happened to be carry-
ing a tape recorder with me (your
English professor would say, ‘‘This
tape recorder appearance’’ is plot ma-
nipulation. Don’t worry, this isn’t
English class, it’s a poorly written
newspaper article, and as you all
know anything can happen in poorly
written newspaper articles), and re-
corded the entire conversation. For
your reading pleasure I have put the
taped conversation on paper. I would
be more than happy to lend the Book
Man tape to anyone who doubts that I
walk around with a tape recorder, ve-
cording conversation. The only prob-
lem is that I just locked the tape into
an important document file that cannot
be opened for twenty years. If you are
a disbeliever please see me in twenty
years. Anyway, here’s the conversa-
tion between me and the Book Man.

Me: ‘‘Hi, how much will you give
me for this complete set of Enyclope-
dia Britannicas. A certified appraiser
told me the set’s worth $2,500.”’

Book Man: (barely looking at them)
‘*Well, unfortunately we've already
met our encyclopedia quota. Besides,
they plan on adding a five page section
on monopolies for next year’s edition.
I know this because I’m writing it. I
guess I could give you $9.80 for them
if you throw in your jacket.”’

Me: ‘‘Nine dollars and eighty
cents?! Are you joking? If I charged
myself labor for carrying the damn set
over here, it would cost more than
that. ‘*

Book Man: “‘I apologize but my
hands are tied. Maybe if you try in the
spring...””

Me: ‘‘Thanks, but I think I'll use
the books for starting large factory
fires. By the way, exactly what type of
material is the Book Man Factory
made out of?

Ps
CORRECTIONS

In the last issue of The Ring-tum
Phi, the Director of Career De-
velopment and Placement Rick
Heatley was incorrectly identified
as Richard Heatley. Also, in the
story ‘‘Not one negative response
to column,’’ the quote ‘‘I think
{[McManus’ article] reflected well
on W&L and I think we can be jus-
tifiably proud of it’’ was incorrec-
tly attributed to President John D.
Wilson. It should have been attri-
buted to Brad Root. The Phi re-
grets the errors.

Chasing down checks |
just for fun and games —

 

MY VIEW
By Sean Bugg

 

I’ve been playing a game re-
cently, which I’m sure just about
everyone at this university has played.
It’s called ‘‘Beat the Check.’’

The rules to this game are very
simple. First, make sure that you have
no money, or at least less than five
dollars. Next, find some large expense
that you did not expect, one that will
run you at least thirty to forty dollars
(By the way, the game is much more
fun if your credit cards are all maxed
out).

Now comes the fun part; figuring
out how to cover the expense, com-
pletely out of thin air.

Is everyone catching on now?

You write a check of course. 1 know
there are spme purists out there
screaming at the thought of writing a
pure rubber check in Big Lex. ‘‘Peo-
ple like you are going to ruin it for us
all! Pretty soon no one will take our
checks at all!”’

Obviously, these people have never
had their car towed away on a Sunday
morning, while two people desperate-
ly need a ride back to school, and
there are only three dollar bills to be
found in the old wallet.

To the Editor:

come.

 

On behalf of OxFam America sponsored by Al-
pha Phi Omega, I would like to extend our thanks
to the entire Washington and Lee community for
their support in this year’s ‘‘Fast for a World
Harvest’’ held on December 1, 1987. The pro-
gram was quite a success and we managed to raise
our estimated goal. Although this was the first
year of OxFam America on our campus, we hope
that it will be the first of many in the years to

Anyway, you now write a check for
whatever the amount. To make things
more interesting, you can write the
check for more than needed so you
can get extra cash into your hand (you
know, for beer, cigarettes, or safe sex
products). But this version of the
game should only be done by experts.
Amateurs should not try this at home.

Trying to find the money that will
cover the check comes next. Go care-
fully to every friend you have (if you
play this game too often, the list could
be very short) and see if they will spot
you the amount. Remember to look as
needy as possible. Wear old clothes, if
necessary.

The next day, put off going to the
bank as long as possible. Of course,
since the banks in Lexington close at
the ridiculous hour of two o’clock, if
you make it before closing time you’re
safe. But try to make it interesting. Go
to Lloyd’s at 1:45 and play a couple
video games or something (maybe
write another check?).

If you make it to the bank by closing
and get the deposit in, you’ve won the
game. It’s that simple. Losing,
though, is a bad scene, as anyone who
has appeared before the Cold Check
Committee can tell you. I can.

Fortunately everything turned out
okay in this latest round of this game.
I wish I could say I have a perfect re-
cord, but I’m actually batting about

LETTERS

meal for the evening. For this and a great deal of
help, we would also like to thank Mr. Darrell and
his staff. In addition, a special thanks to Phi Ka- ‘
ppa Sigma and Delta Tau Delta whose generous
donations helped us tremendously.

This year’s fast was an important beginning, but
we would like to see it become a significant an-
nual activity on the W&L campus. If you have any
questions or would like to help organize next
year’s fast, please feel free to contact me. Again,

.800.

Of course, these aren’t the only
games that W&L students play to
amuse themselves. There is the old
stand-by, Drop-Add Sheet Roulette:
In this game students try to see how
long they can delay trying to get out of
that ‘‘A’’ hour class, and then see how
many people they can fit into the regis;
trar’s office at one time.

Then there is party favorite ‘‘ Dodge
the Date.’’ This is extremely simple to
play. All you have to do is see how
long you can avoid your date during
the course of an evening. You win if
you never see your date again and you
break even if your date happens td
find you before the night is over,
However, you lose if he or she pours a
beer over your head and ransacks your
room.

‘‘Dodge the Date’’ is usually played
at the same time one plays ‘‘Find a
Quick One-Night-Stand.’’ This game
in itself yields many other fun-filled
amusements, such as ‘‘Get Out of Bed
Without Waking It Up’’ and ‘‘Charge
a Penicillin Shot Home.”’ .

I’m sure there are plenty of people
out there who have games that they
either play or observe, but I can’t
mention them all here. It’s just great
to know that W&L is such a fun-filled
place.

APO thanks benefactors.

Skiing class is
extremely popular

 

By Andy Nixon

; Staff Reporter

 

As most students slipped and slid to

* class in the ice and snow this week,
; some W&L students took advantage

of the winter weather to head for the
slopes.

The opportunity to enjoy skiing this
term comes courtesy of the physical
education department and the
Homestead Ski Resort in Hot Springs.

The fact that 220 students, the
largest number ever to sign up for the

. course, attended the first meeting in-
dicates this is one of the more popular
“ courses on Campus.

The Homestead has seven slopes

open to the students encompassing
“over 40 acres. Even though the

Homestead relies upon 100-percent
snow-making procedures, and stu-
dents must provide their own transpor-
tation to and from the ski area, the
price of the program more than com-
pensates the students.

The cost for students with their own
equipment is only $42, and for those
students who rent equipment the cost
is only $60. After paying the fee, stu-
dents receive six sessions of instruc-
tion and practice as well as lift tickets
for all the lessons.

Instruction ranges from beginner to
intermediate and advanced levels,
which allows all students to ski, no
matter from what tropical climate they
might come. So as the ice and snow
prepare to descend once more on the
Lexington area, certain students will
certainly await the white powder with
anticipation.

Seatbelts are law

 

« By Francis Coryell
J Staff Reporter

 

All Washington and Lee students
now have one more thing to worry
, about on their road trip—the new seat
belt law.

Governor Gerald Balilles signed the
, bill in March, and it became law on
Jan. 1. Now, the driver and the front
seat passenger must be wearing their

~.

, Seat belts.

,

Virginia became the 32nd state in
“ the nation to enforce this law. In Vir-
« ginia, the seat belt law is a secondary
law, which means that a police officer
must pull your car over for a different
» reason. An officer can still write out a
ticket, $25 for not wearing the seat
belt, even if the other violation does
+ not result in a ticket.

Although the law requiring seat
belts is new, lawmakers have been try-
+ ing to get it on the books for fifteen
_ years. In 1986 the bill was defeated by

one vote.
¥ According to Charles Bond, Direc-

tor of Information for the Virginia
State Police in Richmond, having the
law enforced as a secondary law may
have been used as a compromise to get
the law passed. If there are fewer
fatalities on the road this year, said
Bond, it is possible that the law could
be ‘‘promoted’’ to a primary law.

Because it is still early in January it
is too soon to judge whether the law is
effective or not. Also complicating the
judgement is that it is difficult to credit
the cause of death in an accident to
just one factor. Bond said that there
may have been fewer deaths on the
road in the year to date than in the
same period last year.

At the end of the month, a summary
will be issued showing how many
tickets have been issued. This is to
gauge how well the law is being ac-
cepted.

According to polls, most believe
that it is a good law. One of the most
commonly asked questions is: ‘‘If a
car has the seat belts torn out, can the
driver still get a ticket?’’ According to
Bond, the answer is yes.

So buckle up or pay up.

W&L will sponsor its second annual
Alcohol and Drug Awareness Week,
Jan. 18-22. The week will feature a
variety of activities designed to
heighten the awareness among stu-
dents, faculty, and staff at W&L of the
problems related to drug and alcohol
abuse. All events are free and open to
the public.

‘‘Our goal is to make the entire uni-

chair of the university’s Health Edu-
cation Committee and associate dean
of students. ‘‘There are. members’ of

Sam Rutigliano, former head coach
of the Cleveland Browns, will kick off

the week’s activities at 7:30 p.m.,
Jan. 18 in Lee Chapel when he will de-
liver a talk on ‘‘An Ordinary Person
Trying To Make A _ Difference.”
Other activities during the week in-
clude two lectures by Bob Lynn, a
substance abuse counselor at Lewis-
Gale Hospital in Roanoke, and a talk
by Lonise Bias, mother of University
of Maryland basketball star Len Bias
who died from a cocaine overdose.

A two-time National Football
League coach of the year, Rutigliano
was a pioneer in dealing with drug and
alcohol problems in sports. As coach
of the Cleveland Browns he formed
the now-famous Inner Circle within
the team. The purpose of the group
was to help-players and their families
come to terms with drug and alcohol
problems and to provide peer support
for those players with problems. Ru-
tigliano credits the group with saving
the lives of 11 players and countless
other individuals who came in contact
with the group.

Rutigliano received his B.A. from
Tulsa University and his M.Ed. from
Columbia University. After coaching
in the high school ranks for eight
years, he coached at the University of
Connecticut and the University of
Maryland before joining the NFL. He
served as an assistant coach for the
Denver Broncos, the New England
Patriots, the New York Jets, and the
New Orleans Saints before being
named head coach at Cleveland. Ru-
tigliano now spends his time doing
commentary on NFL games for NBC
and ESPN and touring the country de-
livering talks on drugs and alcohol
abuse.

A graduate of the University -of
North Carolina, Lynn spent 12 years
in the retail field before entering the
area of drug and alcohol treatment. He

Lip Sync Contest slated for Jan. 22

 

By Melinda Conkling
Staff Reporter

 

Coming to the Generals’ Headquar-
ters soon: Bruce Springsteen,
Run-DMC, U2, and the Grateful
Dead. All these bands and many more
will be represented as the second an-
nual Multiple Sclerosis Lip Sync
Contest takes place on Jan. 22.

The self-

contest is basically

explanatory. Contestants provide their
own tape and are given fake micro-

gs
yt Ta
experience

phones and chairs. Contestants pay $3
for six minutes of actual stage time.

A few of last year’s ‘‘bands’’ were a
Fiji-based group who performed
Run-DMC’s *‘Walk This Way,’” Chi
Psi’s Billy Idol impersonation, Phi
Kap performing Bon Jovi, and the Ca-
lifornia Raisins who did ‘‘Heard It
Through The Grapevine. ”’

Expectations are high for this year’s
contest, according to senior John
Lowe.

‘It’s going to be twice as good as
last year’s,’’ said Lowe, ‘‘The few

mistakes we encountered have been
cleared up. The sound system wasn’t
adequate before, but we are going to
have six speakers this year, and it'll be
great.”’

Spectators can expect to pay $4 to
watch the exhibition which raised
close to $400 last year.

In addition to cash prizes of $50,
$40, and $20 for the top three contes-
tants, there will be door prizes such as
albums, Fancy Dress tickets, and gift
certificates from local restaurants.

‘The Lip Sync contest originated

s
last year when Director of University
Food Services Gerry Darrell, who is
also the Regional Multiple Sclerosis
Director, handpicked a group of stu;
dents who were active and wanted to
conquer student apathy at W&L,’*
said Lowe.

Junior Jim Cobb will be the emcee,
of the competition, which will take
place at 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 22 in the
GHQ.

Senior Simon Perez swims the backstroke in Sunday’s win over Georgetown.

Great performances
turned in by women

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee women’s
swimming coach Page Remillard had
anticipated Georgetown’s victory over
the General’s but he was not prepared
for the outstanding performances by
the W&L athletes, which resulted not
only in the relatively close final score
of 129 to 75, but also in the team’s
higher level of confidence.

Remillard stated freely that he was
thrilled with the meet, and he attri-

butes its sustained upbeat mood to the’

team’s success in the first event. Re-
millard never thought W&L could win
the medley relay, and the Generals
were behind until junior Nancy Wha-
len came in as the anchor. Swimming
in freestyle, the two competitors
fought for the lead continously, each
one pulling just a few strokes ahead of
the other. Finally, toward the end of
the lap, urged on by the cheering of
both the fans and her teammates,
Whalen went ahead and won the event
for the Generals.

Such an accomplishment encour-
aged the swimmers as well as the spec-
tators, who provided excellent sup-
port, said Remillard.

“This was an incredible feat in it-

self, and it also set the stage for the
rest of the meet,’’ he said.

Whalen finished with an impressive
time. According to Remillard, she has
been ‘‘training excessively.’’ He also
believes she employed a tactic that he
refers to as “‘leaving your heart in the
pool.”’

That was just one of two particu-
larly notable achievements. Freshman
Kristen Wagner scored a personal vic-
tory while placing third in the
1000-yard freestyle event.

In the 50-yard intervals, which con-
stitute one-twentieth of the race,
Wagner kept her pace within tenths of
her goal plan. As a result, she was
beaten by only four seconds—a time
difference less extreme than Remil-
lard had predicted.

The meet ended with everyone feel-
ing pleased about the events and look-
ing ahead optimistically toward the
next opponent—Johns Hopkins. Re-
millard evaluated Hopkins as a very
formidable Division III team on a par
with Georgetown. And since W&L
performed so strongly against George-
town, the next meet appears less threa-
tening. Remillard summed up the feel-
ing of the team:

‘‘The message we need to send to
Johns Hopkins is that [our program is]
only three years old, and we’re getting
better quickly.”’

Basketball extends streak to four

Archrival Roanoke at the Warner Center tonight

 

By Mike Shady.
Sports Editor

 

Tuesday night at the Warner Center
was the same old story for the W&L
basketball team. The Generals played
poorly but were still able to come
away with a 76-71 win over Mt. Saint

‘*‘No one played well,’’ said head
coach Verne Canfield, whose club
upped its record to 10-1. ‘‘We’re not
adjusting within a ball game. When
someone’s taking something away
from us, we have to be strong enough
mentally to adjust.”

The Generals failed to adjust to the
quickness and tough, fullcourt man-
to-man pressure that the Knights
threw at them. W&L committed 17
turnovers, attributed for the most part
to the lightening-fast hands of Keith
Higgs and Curtis Britt, who each had
four of Mt. Saint Mary’s 15 steals.

The game was close from the open-
ing tipoff to the final buzzer with
neither team able to dominate the
other. The Generals went into half-
time with a 39-33 lead, mainly on the
shoulders of senior guard Steve Han-
cock. Hancock carried W&L during
the first 20 minutes, scoring 17 (in-
cluding 3-3 on three- point shots) of
his game-high 24 points.

The Knights hung close and tied the
score at 57-all with 7:54 remaining in
the second half. Two minutes later,

Mt. Saint Mary had built a four-point
lead at 61-57 and the pressure seemed
to be getting to the Generals.

Somebody, however, forgot to tell
that to freshman forward Ed Hart and
junior guard Emmanuel Klump. With
the Generals trailing 68-67 and 1:15
showing on the clock, Hart flashed
across the lane, turned and popped
home a 14-foot jumpshot to give the
Generals the lead. Delor Johnson
made one of two free throws to tie the
ballgame with :57 left, but then it was
Klump’s turn.

Spinning in the lane, Klump was
fouled with 19 seconds to go. After
confidently stepping up to the line,
Klump cooly swished both of the free
throws. A Knight turnover nine se-
conds later put Klump back on the
line, this time in a one-and-one situa-
tion. But the unfazed junior, who
scored 17 points in the game, buried
both of them and the Generals had a
73-69 lead they would not relinquish.
In all, Klump hit 7 of 8 freethrows
down the stretch.

‘Last year we played like we were
afraid to win,’’ he said. ‘‘We knew we
were going to win this game. We all
had confidence in ourselves. Last year
we would have lost a game like this.”’

With this game behind them, the
Generals, with a 2-1 Old Dominion
Athletic Conference record, can now
look forward to lots of conference
games, starting with the archrival
Maroons of Roanoke College (7-2,

0-1 in the ODAC) tonight at the War-
ner Center. Roanoke was one of the
preseason favorites to win the confer-
ence, although the Maroons got man-
handled last weekend by Emory and
Henry at the Salem Civic Center.

‘They have five players who can
play extremely well together,”’ said
Canfield. *‘T have tremendous respect
for them. They will come in fired up.
You probably have to look it up the
last time they lost two games in a
row.”’

‘‘We just have got to be ready to
play,’’ said Klump. ‘‘I think we have
already proven that we can play with
anyone in the conference."’

HOOKSHOTS—Roanoke had three
players last week battling amongst
themselves to reach the 1000-point
marks for their careers... Can-
field will start freshman guard Mike
Holton instead of senior forward Gary
Schott. Schott has been struggling and
the Generals have had success with the
three-guard offense. Also, Canfield
said they ‘‘match up better’’ against
the three-guard offense of the Mar-
oons... Generals lost last year’s home
game against Roanoke, 81-58, when
W&L shot a pitiful 16 percent from
the floor in the second half... Tipoff
will be at 7:30 p.m. with the game be-
ing carried live on 91.5 WLUR...

Swimmers halt Hoyas

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Led by three first-place performan-
ces from sophomore Shawn Cope-
land, including his best time ever in
the 200-yard freestyle, the Washing-
ton and Lee men’s swimming team re-
corded a 20-point win over George-
town Sunday at Cy Twombly Pool.

“I really enjoyed this meet,’’ said
head coach Page Remillard. ‘‘We had
some outstanding swims across the
board. I felt really good about W&L
swimming Sunday.”’

Copeland started his hat trick by
taking a two-second win in_ the
200-yard freestyle. His time of
1:47.03 shattered his previous best by
four seconds and puts pressure on ju-

 

 

By Perry Hayes/The Ring-tum Phi

 

nior David Reavy, who holds the
school record in the 200 but has been
out of competition due to illness.

Copeland recorded his second win
of the day in the 200-yard butterfly,
edging W&L junior Moose Herring
by almost four seconds. In Copeland’s
first appearance in that event this
year, his time of 2:01.92 was the best
performance by a General this season.

A native of Charleston, West Vir-
ginia, Copeland completed the hat
trick by taking first place in the
200-yard breast stroke. Once again
there was no waiting for the instant
replay, as Copeland beat out W&L
freshman Tomas Perez by over three
seconds, 2:18.07 to 2:21.54.

After the meet, Remillard called
Copeland’s success an example of
hard work and a great attitude paying
off. ‘‘He’s been working very, very

hard. He came back early, on Decem
ber 26, and has just taken everythin;
that we've given him. The guy’s atti
tude is just terrific.”’

Herring also performed well for th«
Generals, taking first in the 1000-yar<
freestyle in 10; 19.57 and the 200-yarc
backstroke with a time of 2:08.57
Other firsts for W&L were recordec
by juniors Jeff Bercaw and Davic
Dietz, who tied for the win in the
50-yard freestyle with times of 22.71
and by the 400- yard medley relay
team of freshman James Dunlevy
Perez, Bercaw and Dietz. Perez alsc
had his own first place, a win in the
200-yard medley with a time ol
2:04.36.

The Generals will return to competi-
tion this Friday, January 15, when
they face Shippensburg College in a
dual meet at Cy Twombly Pool.

Grapplers falter in
heavier classes

Generals blow 17-0 lead

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

The W&L wrestling team got the
light and the heavy of it last weekend
in a dual meet against Western Mary-
land at Doremus Gymnasium. Light in
the sense the lower weight classes
dominated. Heavy in the sense the
higher weight classes were unable to
hold onto an early lead as the Generals
lost 28- 22.

W&L got off to a fast start, grab-
bing the first four weight classes. The
Generals, 0-1, began things with
freshman Rich Weinstein winning by
forfeit at 118 Ibs. Senior Steve Castle
then scored a 21-9 victory at 126, fol-
lowed by an 8-0 win by senior John
Lowe at 134 and a 9-3 triumph by
sophomore Lee Garlove. Team score
at this point: Generals 17, Western
Maryland 0.

‘‘We got some outstanding perfor-
mances from our guys in the lower

weight classes,’’ said head coach Gary
Franke. ‘‘But, we just came up a little
short.”’

Short, indeed. Western Maryland
took the next four matches, including
two pins and a technical fall. The turn-
ing point of the meet was when senior
Kevin McNamara was pinned at :58
of the second period in his bout at 158.
After William Avery suffered a pin at
1:51 of the second at 177, the Gen-
erals saw themselves trailing 22-17.

Junior Greg Loupassi earned a
tough 6-4 win at the 190 weight class
to make the score 22-20 going into the
heavyweight division, but Western
Maryland wrapped up the meet with
another pin.

The Generals will travel to wrestle
in the Lebanon Valley Dual Meet Invi-
tational Tournament on Saturday.
W&L will take on the winner of the
Baptist Bible/Lebanon Valley match
in the morning. Each team, regardless
of whether it wins or loses, is guar-
anteed three dual matches.

Hughes & Hollywood grow up

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

‘Tis the season for bittersweet
comedies, or at least ones that know
how to tug on the old heartstrings. Just
when it seemed that Hollywood had
become obsessed with violence, mur-
der, and adultery (a la nearly every
major film released before Novem-
ber), along came three handsome
bachelors, two stranded clowns, and a
baby in a pink hardhat to save the day.
Maybe Hollywood is starting to grow
up a little. Now we will just have to
wait and see whether Planes, Trains,
and Automobiles and Three Men
and a Baby are the rule or the excep-
tion.

While the verdict is still out on
Hollywood, there is no question that
John Hughes has finally jumped over
from his sophomoric world of tragica-
lly naive parents and rebellious teen
control into the wonderful world of
adulthood. In short, Hughes has fina-
lly learned how to make a touching
film that neither goes overboard nor
insults your intelligence with its ab-
surdity.

Until now, all of Hughes films have
been nothing more than amusing fan-
tasy anecdotes about what it would be
like if teenagers could make up life’s
rules. Pretty in Pink, Ferris Buel-
ler’s Day Off and Some Kind of
Wonderful which Hughes produced,
all tried to make serious points in the

midst of slapstick and sassy dialogue
and totally missed their marks. Even
Hughes’ most successful film The
Breakfast Club, which at times pos-
sessed a poignant insight into the often
cut-throat world of high school, just

never reached its potential; a typical
Hughes trademark. That is, until now.

In Planes, Trains, and Automo-

can be a real director. The story, the

are all wonderful. John Candy puts in

Hot new sounds
from The Silencers

 

By Greg Unger
Music Critic

 

Behold the Silencers’ debut album
A Letter from St. Paul--an artistical-
ly superb first effort from this Scottish
quartet. Though pop oriented, this
stuff still retains an authentic progres-
sive persona that is anything but tri-
vial. Their music is up-tempo and cat-
chy without being teeny-bopper- like.

**Painted Moon”’ starts the L.P. off
and is fairly reresentative of the whole
album. The Silencers make effective
use of synthesizer molested guitar
work that is refreshingly different and
that is what sets their music apart from
the veritable plethora of ‘new’ music
that continually bombards us. ‘‘I
Can’t Cry”’ is slower and more poig-
nant but the first side immediately,
picks up again with ‘‘Bullets and Blue

Skies.’’ ‘‘God’s Gift’’ rounds out the
**A”’side.

The ‘‘B’’side starts off with proba-
bly the best tume on the whole
album-- ‘‘I See Red.’’ In fact, the
whole second side is, strong. ‘‘A Let-
ter from St. Paul,’’ the title track, is a
wonderfully weird tune with that
characteristic guitar work and some
manic/depressive dialogue from guest
Mary Lou Colombo. No singing here,
but take a listen. ‘‘Possessed’’ is a
fiery dance track that resembles the
faster music by The The on their In-
fected L.P.. It gets stronger every
time one hears it.

I believe we can expect more music

curtain rings Del Griffith. Candy's
ability to act without humor is a di-
mension of his talent that the public
hasn’t seen before and one that may
surprise you. While Candy is good,
Steve Martin is fantastic.

Steve Martin has for many years
been one of Hollywood’s foremost
comedians but his last two roles as
straight men in this summer's smash
Roxanne and now in Planes, Trains,
and Automobiles are establishing him
as a fine actor as well. Last year,
many critics were crying that Martin
was robbed of a Best Supporting
Actor nomination at the Academy
Awards for his role as the sadistic den-
tist Orin Scrivello in Little Shop of
Horrors. Maybe this spring he'll
receive one for Best Actor.

The chemistry between Candy and
Martin works from the very begin-
ning. From the moment Candy steals
Martin’s cab in downtown Manhattan
it’s off to the races on a hilarious ride
of annoyance, friendship, and ultimate
compassion. This film works because
of the attention Hughes pays to the
little things. Candy’s pajamas that
match the curtains of every motel
room he and Martin stay in, the
charred Diner’s Club Card, the car
rental receit that blows away, the mel-
ted speedometer, the velvet painting
of Roy Orbison on the motel wall;
they all add to the beauty of this film.
Hughes gives the audience just enough
but he never goes overboard.

While all of this works, it is still the
finale that makes this film a real gem.
The conclusion is compassionate, its
beautiful, and its what Hollywood has
been missing for quite some time; the
happy ending. Bravo to John Hughes.
He is finally learning what it takes to
make a real movie.

 

 

Leonard Nimoy isn’t doing too ba-
dly himself. After his directorial suc-
cess of Star Trek III: The Search for
Spock in 1984 and Star Trek IV: The
Voyage Home in 1986, Nimoy turned
to a more humorous story and set out
to remake the 1985 French film smash
Tres Hommes et une Coffin. Three
Men and a Baby is currently the
United States’ fourth highest grossing
film released last year.

Three Men and a Baby is a movie
that just makes you feel good. Watch-
ing three obviously clueless men try-
ing to feed, wash, and take care of a
baby’s ‘‘doodles’’ is simply amusing.
In fact, watching anyone taking care
of a baby is funny. W.C. Fields once

The Ring-tum Phi, January 14, 1988

said ‘‘If you don’t ever want to be up-
staged, don’t ever work with animals
or children.’’ After seeing Three
Men and a Baby one can understand
his sentiment. Baby Mary steals more
than just scenes in the film. She steals
your heart.

Tom Selleck, Ted Danson, and
Steve Guttenberg give fine perfor-
mances as the the architect who can’t
figure out how to put on a diaper, the
cartoonist who can’t stop Mary's cry-
ing, and the actor who finds out that
being a father is not a two-month
shoot but a perminent role. The three
men work beautifully as an ensemble
and really make the film work. The
scene where they sing ‘Goodnight
Sweetheart’ to the baby is wonderful.

The only thing about the film that
hurts it is that it gets dragged down in
a drug subplot that doesn’t belong.

tiful when directors get them just
right.

| Wilson speaks on the

Staff Reporter

 

Fraternity house renovation under
the Renaissance Program will com-
mence when fraternities have adopted
new standards released by the uni-
versity, said W&L president John D.
Wilson in the keynote address at
Tuesday’s Omicron Delta Kappa
Founders’ Day celebration.

Wilson called the Renaissance Pro-
gram ‘‘by far the largest challenge on
our agenda.”’

Referring to the newly released
study, Washington and Lee University
Standards for Fraternities, Wilson
said, *‘They are really very ordinary,
but they must be adopted. ’”

The standards call for fraternities to
have sound financial policies and an
annual budget, provisions for house
maintenance, revised by-laws outlin-
ing the organization of the chapter, as
well as other standards.

Wilson said, ‘‘The cynical can say
‘here we go again,’ yet another at-
tempt to encourage the improvement
of the W&L fraternity system.”’

However, he told the audience that
the standards, along with the ‘‘Report
of the Fraternity Housing Renovation
Steering Committee,’’ represent a
“new beginning’ for the W&L
fraternity system.

Wilson also spoke about the pro-
posed restructuring of Rush, the
system by which fraternities acquire
new members for their organizations.
He said the review of the system was
prompted not by the Standards, but by
a petition signed by over 100 faculty
members.

Wilson said he did not completely
understand the Rush rules or how they
could be improved.

“I’m guessing that that is partly
what the petition is trying to say,”’
Wilson said. ‘We have a crazy-quilt
patchwork of rules and procedures
that no one fully understands any-
more.”

The question of next year’s Rush
will be discussed in the next few
weeks, Wilson said. He expressed a
hope that the basic purposes of Rush,
obtaining a solid pledge class for the

In order to avert a move to January
Rush, the Interfraternity Council de-
cided it must make concessions in its
bylaws.

In the IFC meeting on Tuesday
night, IFC President Mark Farley
went over a series of amendments to
both its 1988 Rush calendar and its by-
laws.

Members first decided to make
several changes in its Informal Rush
dates. These include allowing Chapter
Houses to have one Rush date at a
country residence that the fraternity
might have. Restrictions on the use of
country houses include providing
transportation to and from the country
house, allowing only one of the two

houses, and allowing entering students
to adjust to campus life and such, will
be remembered by those involved.

Wilson said there were ‘‘lots of
fears and lots of unknowns Surround-
ing this subject.’’ These include the
financial problems possible with a de-
layed Rush and the effect on the pat-
tern of social life, he said.

‘*There may be some surface in-
compatibilities,"’ he said, ‘‘but let’s
hope we can reconcile these and get on
with the basic reconstruction of our
entire system.”’

Wilson also spoke about the condi-
tion of the university, especially with
the stock market crash last October.

**T believe the state of the university
is sound,’’ Wilson said.

Wilson said the annual Fund was
down in donors but up in money, and
he said the budget was in good shape.
The decline in the stock market resul-
ted in a decline in the value of W&L’s
portfolio of 6.5 percent as of Oct. 20,
he said.

The financial situation ‘‘is not as
bright as it was,’’ Wilson said. With
costs up, the university must find
ways to support new positions, salary
adjustment needs, financial aid and
supplies and equipment with money
from tuition, annual giving and the
endowment income, he said.

However, he said the university
would have to avoid becoming accus-
tomed to the increase in tuition re-
venue that has been generated by the
excess enrollment, which should be
diminished in the coming years by the
lowering of the freshman class size.

The size of the freshman class has
been reduced from 420 to 400, he
said, due to the unforseen retention
rate the university has had recently.

Wilson said the fund-raising process
for the proposed Performing Arts
Center was progressing well. By Dec.
31 of 1987 $4.5 million had been
raised for the construction, he said,
which the university hopes to begin in
May or June.

Wilson spoke about the archi-
tectural history of the campus in the
beginning of his speech, admiring the
way architectural mistakes of the past
have been corrected and the dedica-
tion of the men and women who have

IFC proposes changes

Informal Rush dates to be held at the
country house, and requiring that the
function have no alcohol. The IFC
will enforce these rules by registering
the functions and possibly having spot
checks at the Rush dates by the IFC.

Women were also mentioned with
respect to all Rush Functions. A mo-
tion was passed to keep the current re-
gulations that allow women from
W&L to attend certain Rush func-
iions, including the Informal Rush
functions, but not ali of them.

Finally, alcohol consumption by
freshmen was discussed by the mem-
bers. Farley was concerned about the
number of freshmen who had to go to
the emergency room this past year
after the ban on alcohol ws lifted.

Wilson said the admissions office
was predicting over 3,000 applica-
tions for 400 spaces in the next year’s
incoming freshman class. Twenty-five
percent of those spaces have already
been filled with early decision appli-
cants, Wilson said.

Wilson told the audience of recent
developments in the W&L community
that reflect positive growth. In the
fall, students will be able to participate
for credit in the University- Rock-
bridge Symphony Orchestra, which
Wilson hopes will be a ‘fruitful town-
gown cooperation.”

in Rush calendar

‘‘We put a record number of fresh-
men in the hospital this year, and
something has got to be done about
it,’’ Farley said. The parties on Sept.
16 and 17 would be limited to beer,
the IFC decided. In addition, the beer
must not be distributed from a com-
munal source.

“If it gets to the point where you
[the fraternity ]has all the beer hoarded
in the ice-chest and freshmen are al-
lowed to pick it out, then that’s a
communal source,”’ Farley said.

The IFC went on to make several
important changes in its bylaws.
These changes were in response to a
faculty and SAC recommendation that
Rush be moved to January. Farley
cited several reasons why Rush in
January would be unwise.

“It would lengthen Rush, it would

be difficult to enforce, and it would
generate ill-will,’’ Farley said.

The IFC however, felt that it was
important to make concessions in or-
der to avert deferred Rush, on which
the faculty has final say. Rather than
fight the faculty and appear bull-
headed about changes Farley sug-
gested that two areas be amended,
deferred pledgeship and the length of
pledge training.

As it stands, once a pledge has
‘torn’ and officially become a pledge
at the house, pledgeship begins. For
some houses, the pledge period may
last until spring term.

The faculty has asked that this time
period be lessened to ten weeks. The
IFC thinks that this period is too short
if pledges are to fully learn about the
fraternity.

Wolfe first began writing fiction at
W&L. Wolfe participated in an fiction
seminar that took place at The Dutch

SAC lifts Delt’s
probation early

 

By Jennifer Bandrowski
Staff Reporter

 

Delta Tau Delta had a year of social
probation suspended after only five
months after an appeal to the Student
Affairs Committee by fraternity
president Kevin Webb.

The year of probation was imposed
after an incoming freshman was ser-
iously injured following a Delt Sum-
mer Rush party in July.

‘‘We made a 20-page report and
submitted it to the Student Affairs
Committee, detailing our progress
since social probation,’’ Webb said.

Webb prepared the report with the
assistance of Pearson Keyes.

The improvements cited included
raising the house GPA from 17th to
seventh place, resolving all past tax
problems, reforming the house cor-
poration, and improving the fraterni-
ty’s overall campus involvement.

In addition, the Delts performed an
array of charity services, from clean-
ing Stonewall Jackson cemetery to ra-
ising funds for polio and multiple
sclerosis research. Delt junior Ian
Thompson also arranged an alcohol
awareness week.

The report was strengthened by a
petition with 400 signatures from stu-
dents, faculty and alumni voicing their
support for Delt.

‘Financially, we're doing fine,”’
Webb said. ‘‘We’re under the uni-
versity billing system and getting
along all right for a small house. ”’

IFC President Mark Farley com-
mented, ‘‘I think it’s a very positive
thing for the fraternity system. It was

an unfortunate accident, but I’m
pleased that the Delts responded so
positively to their punishment. Many
other houses would have rebelled and
in the end brought about their down-
fall. Instead, the house rallied around
the leadership of Kevin Webb and
lasted out a difficult 12 weeks. I think
that Kevin and all the Delts are to be
commended for insuring their house’s
survival.”’

Associate Dean Leroy C. Atkins
was also pleased with the Delts’ posi-
tive response. ‘‘They had made so
many improvements and gains during
the time they were on probation. and
they responded in such a_ positive
way,”” he said.

Delt had their first party last Friday.
**Being the first party, it was BYOB,”’
Webb said. Currently their national
fraternity will not allow them to spend
house funds on alcohol. However,
that policy is *‘possible to repeal—it’s
in limbo right now,’* Webb said.

At the party there were signs
posted, ‘*‘Don’t drink and drive. If
you’re had too much to drink, ask a
brother for a ride.’’ There were five
designated drivers present at the
party. Webb described it as ‘‘under
control for such a large party.””

According to Webb, **All social and
rushing privileges have been rein-
stated. We will formally start rushing
this weekend with open houses... it
will be our own Rush, following all
school guidelines as well as our
national fraternity guidelines.”

Webb added that, ‘‘the brothers of
Delta Tau Delta would like to thank
the W&L community for its support
during this past term.’

ODK taps twenty-four

 

By Sean Bugg
Staff Reporter

 

W&L’s chapter of Omicron Delta
Kappa tapped 24 students and three
honorary initiates during the Foun-
ders’ Day celebration Tuesday.

The new initiates were introduced
by senior Steve Cassell, president of
the W&L chapter of ODK. He told the
audience that W&L has never had a
shortage of leaders.

‘We are a product of our envir-
onment,”’ he said.

A national honorary fraternity that
recognizes leadership achievements,
ODK was founded at W&L in 1914.

The three honorary initiates were
John W. Elrod, G. David Low and
Stewart Morris.

Elrod is dean of the college at
W&L. He received his master’s and
doctorate in philosophy at Columbia
University, and before coming to
WAL served as chairman of the philo-
sophy department at Iowa State Uni-

versity.

Low, a 1978 graduate of W&L,
where he earned a degree in physics-
engineering, has been involved in the
planning of several planetary missions
while working with the Spacecraft
Systems Engineering Section at Cali-
fornia Institute of Technology. In
1985 Low qualified for assignment as
an astronaut on future space shuttle
missions.

Morris, of Houston, works with
Stewart Title, a network of 1,200 of-
fices and agencies. The Morris
House, on the W&L campus, was
named for him and his wife, whose
large gift to the university made the
restoration of the house possible.

Twenty-four W&L students were
inducted into ODK in the Founders’
Day ceremony.

From the law school were: David B.
Carson of La Jolla, Calif.; John E.

Halloran of Manchester, N.H.; Wil-
liam W. Senft, of Lexington, Va.; and
David A. Walsh of Richmond, Va.

Latture picture pilfered

By Betsy Parkins
Staff Reporter

 

Crime in the University Center con-
tinued Wednesday, Jan. 13 when a
27-year-old painting of Rupert Latture
was stolen from Evans Dining Hall.

The theft of the painting is the se-
cond incident of crime in the Universi-
ty Center in the last three weeks. Van-
dals damaged the Career De-
velopment Center bulletin board by
pulling off clip- boards and tearing
down posters.

According to Charles ‘*‘Murph”’
Murray, director of W&L Campus
Security, the painting of Latture was
taken after midnight from the dining
hall and returned by mail Monday
morning.

“Whoever took the painting also
may have done some damage in the

bathroom beneath the dining hall.
They soaped **DU*’ [Delta Upsilon
fraternity} on the mirrors down
there,’’ said Murray.

Washington and Lee Security specu-
lates that members of the Delta Upsi-
lon fraternity at either the Roanoke
College or Virginia Tech campuses
may have taken the painting as part of
pledge activities.

‘The painting was returned this
morning [Monday, Jan. 18] and the
postmark was from Salem, Virginia.
We called down to Virginia Tech se-
curity because that Wednesday night
Steve Tomlinson [W&L security] took
down a license plate number from a
car that had a Virginia Tech sticker on
it,’” Murray said.

University hopes to renovate all fraternity houses by Sept. 1993

 

By David Emrich
Co-Editor

 

In order to realize the goals W&L
set in the recently published Washing-
ton and Lee Standards for Fraternities
the university has begun a program
designed to renovate all the existing
chapter houses by as early as Sept.
1993.

According to Associate Dean Leroy
C. Atkins the renovation program is
“geared toward putting all of our
fraternity houses in the condition
where they would have another 50
years of useful life as really quality
places to live and quality places to
have parties.”’

This past summer, VMDO Archi-

tects in Charlottesville did a feasibility
study of all the fraternity houses. The
company inspected each house and
made recommendations about the
types of repairs that would be needed.
They then estimated the cost of the re-
pairs and will present the information
to the Board of Trustees at their Jan.
29 meeting.

The university is going to use
VMDO'’s studies as the basis for the
future renovations of the houses. But
before any renovations take place, At-
kins said the fraternities are going to
have to comply with the university's
recently published standards.

‘*The houses that are ready first,”’
said Atkins, ‘*because they’re in com-
pliance with the standards, because
they've got a good active house cor

Mb antl etna ib me

poration that’s in compliance with the
standards and they want to get the
work done and they've begun to iden-
tify some sources of capital to do it,
they're going to be the people that
would go first.”’

According to Atkins, judgments as

made by the Fraternity House Renova
tion Steering Committee. That com
mittee will review applications begin-
ning either this spring or summer. The
committee will then consult with other
university Organizations to assess the
relative preparedness of all parts of
the chapters

Said Atkins, *‘What [the Renova
tion Steering Committee] will do is to
look to the Alumni Fraternity Council
to evaluate the strength and readiness
of the house corporation, they'll look

to the IFC and the Student Affairs
Committee to evaluate the strength of
the chapter.

**Part of what they'll look to, in ad-
dition to weighing all that, is the need.
A chapter that’s got the worst prob-
lems physically but also seems to be
prepared to handle the cost of the
project would certainly be one of the
first ones to be eligible.

‘The point is that once the whole
program is in place and people are
ready to proceed it will be a fair, or-
derly process. So that somebody
might gain a slight advantage for a

Atkins stressed, however, that the
university would not provide a great
deal of money towards the renova-
tions. Rather, he said it will be up to
the individual house corporations to
raise the bulk of the capital.

Said Atkins, ‘‘I don’t foresee large
parts of the cost of that project being
borne by the university.

‘Primarily the intent is for the
fraternity houses to continue to be
owned dnd operated by alumni groups
that make up the house corporation. ”’

However, Atkins said, under cer-
tain conditions the relationship be-
tween the individual chapters and the
alumni groups may have to be modi
fied.

‘For the purposes of coming up
with enough money to do the [renova
tions] right, we might have to make

some revisions in how that [re-
lationship] works. But it wouldn't be a
situation in which the house corpora
tion would lose their autonomy in the
operation of the house, or the chapters
would lose their autonomy."*

The house corporations of each
chapter have seen the architect's study
and estimates and have an idea of the
amount of money they need to raise.
Atkins is optimistic that every house
will be able to afford the renovations.

Said Atkins, *‘I think that what the
university is going to provide instead
of university funds is university sup
port in a way that everybody that’s got
the strength of their house corporation
and the strength of a good strong chap
ter that they will be able to come up
with the money.”’
 

 

OPINION
Standards

As part of his Founders’ Day address, university president John
D. Wilson discussed the future of the Fraternity Renaissance Pro-
gram, which will begin when fraternities adopt the standards re-
cently set forth in a report by the Fraternity House Renovation
Steering Committee.

These standards include written by-laws outlining the rules of the
fraternity (including responsible use of alcohol and the prohibition
of illegal drugs in the houses); conducting ‘‘a responsible pledge
education program that conforms to the Interfraternity Council’s
regulations; conducting a social program adhering to the IFC’s re-
gulations; and promoting ‘‘academic excellence and intellectual
growth among its members. ‘*

The physical standards for the houses require that they not only
conform to fire, safety, health and sanitation codes; they must also
provide ‘‘bedroom and bath facilities of a quality at least equal to
the best residence hall accommodations provided by the Universi-
ty.“

‘*They are really very ordinary,’’ said Wilson, ‘‘but they must be
adopted.’’ He said the standards must be adopted before the renova-
tion begins in order for the whole program to ‘‘make sense.”’

We agree with president Wilson’s assessment and the standards
that have been set forth by the Steering Committee’s report. The
fraternity system at Washington and Lee needs to be overhauled,
and the time to do it is know, while the momentum is there.

Wilson is correct in citing the many problems with the current
fraternity system. Most of the houses are in a run-down condition
and leadership is weak in many key places. Until these problems are
corrected W&L will never have a fraternity system of a level of
excellence comparable to the university itself.

Another development we are glad to see is the reduction of the
size of the entering freshman class. It’s wonderful that the universi-
ty is retaining more students than they had planned, but it is not
good that the size of the university seems to be growing all around
us. Washington and Lee is a small liberal arts institution. The tea-
cher/student ratio leads to a more comfortable relationship with the
faculty and a better education. The university needs to remain this
type of institution.

It seems that the Performing Arts Center will be a reality in the
future. The fund-raising is going well, and the university is hoping
to begin construction on the facility in June. Hopefully, they will
not run into any of the problems that they have experienced with the
Gaines Residence Hall. Still, we think the center will be a very val-
uable addition to the W&L community.

All in all, it is good to hear that the university is in good condi-
tion, even if the financial situation is not as good as it was before the
October stock market crash. Still, with the loyal alumni and friends
of the university, we believe W&L be sound far into the future.

A compromise for the frats and the Hill

 

MY VIEW
By Mike Hassinger

 

If you were bored enough to listen
closely to the current discussion over
the problems with the Rush calendar
at W and L, you would notice that in
between all the hot air and differing
opinions there is one recurring theme:
Nobody likes it. I mean NOBODY.
Not the faculty, which seems to think
that fraternities are religious organiza-
tions which worship the demon rum
and conspire to turn freshmen into in-
dentured servants with low grades,
nor. the fraternity members who see

_ “the hil?’ as an extension of the

Women’s Temperance Union trying
to impose a Draconian system of rules
regardless of the effect on the frater-
nity system. Such talk, on either side,
is both inaccurate and unfair.

Out of this rhetorical pushing and
pulling, however, has come a new
proposal which is at once both radica-
lly different and in line with what I
like to call the ‘told W & L.”’ It comes
from members of the faculty who have

had enough experience with fraterni-
ties (either at their colleges or W&L)
to see that fraternities do not have to
be a stumbling block to the learning
experience and that they really do
have something to offer to those who
join. It is called ‘‘deferred pledging”’
but is actually a compromise which
should please almost everyone and
give the hard-core malcontents some-
thing they can live with.

The Compromise proposal would
replace the current Rush with one
which is actually longer. Instead of
two or three frantic weeks of intensity
followed by up to twenty academic
weeks of pledgeship, Fall term would
consist of the first two weeks in which
no freshmen were allowed on frater-
nity property but open contact on
campus would be encouraged. This
would allow freshmen to see exactly
what is expected of them academically
before having to deal with Rush. It
would also allow them to make their
own friends and meet fraternity men
in an academic environment. Rush
would begin on the Friday night after
the first full week of classes.

The type of Rush which would take
place would be different as well.
Rather than having seventeen houses
competing against each other for the
best bands, three or four houses close
to each other would have live music
on one weekend night, while the other

thirteen or fourteen would have either
‘‘closed’’ parties to which they could
invite up to thirty freshmen, or ‘‘pri-
vate’’ parties limited to members and
dates only. Which houses get what
type of party on which weekend would
be predetermined, based on a house’s
performance during the previous
years’ Rush. Like the NFL draft,
those houses which did poorly would
be given the ’’prime’’ party nights.
This would be Fall term partying at W
& L, with the exceptions of Home-
coming and Parent’s Weekend, during
which the fraternities would have their
choice.

The primary rule to the Compro-
mise proposal would be that no fresh-
men would be allowed to pledge a
fraternity until the second term. This
means that he would not assume the
pledge duties until that time, though
he could, at a predetermined date, as-
sociate (or ‘‘tear’’) with a house and
begin paying. social dues. This would
relieve some of the financial burden
on fraternities without putting the in-
tensity of pledgeship on a freshman in
his first term.

All freshmen who participate in
Rush would have to be out of frater-

nity houses by a reasonable hour (say,

10:00 p.m.) on Sunday through
Thursday nights during fall term,
thereby giving them time to be well-
rested and maybe even prepared for

class the next day. Fraternities could «
use the weeknights to invite the
freshman to dinner, and each could
see the other in an atmosphere which
is not as alcohol-intensive as a party.

If the Compromise Deferred pledg-
ing plan is to be truly effective,it
would need cooperation between
fraternities and the university, some-
thing which is now nonexistent. Con-
cessions could be made on both sides, |
with the fraternities agreeing not to
purchase alcohol for band or closed *
parties and the university providing |
security and a shuttle service to and
from the dorms. (Only those with a
DUI quota to fill would be opposed to,
this.)

This proposal, like all proposals, is
not perfect. W & L would need a Rush
board to oversee the system, especial-
ly during the first couple of years. But
many of the problems have been wor-
ked out by those faculty members who
were willing to sit down and work on *
what has been a constant problem at ,
this school for years. A plan which is
radically different from what we now
have has been proposed. This plan
would change the dynamics Rush
from competition to cooperation, al-
low both fraternities and freshmen
greater selectivity and strengthen both
the fraternity system and the universi- *
ty. Taking the vurry out of Rush will»
benefit everyone.

To the student body of Washington & Lee
Univ. (or select members thereof),

I would like to thank you all for allowing me to
be a rich, preppie, bigot. At most institutions, a
student such as I would be expected to act with a
measure of mature understanding, but here my ig-
norance is tolerated - and sometimes praised. As a
Senior, I couldn’t help but reminisce about some
of my more inconsiderate moments at W & L.

I recall just the other day, for instance, scratch-
ing a tribute to our revered Honor System right on
the wall of a university elevator for everyone to
admire. After all, such a weighty subject deserves
public praise (I reserve my less insightful scrib-
blings for the university bathrooms). And then
there was the loud party - complete with brew -
b which was held in the University Library. It was
almost as fun as watching the surrounding stu-
dents when I chew tobacco in class. Perhaps I'll
start smoking in the classroom next!

My fonder moments, however, have come at
the expense of minority students and other unac-

the United States bigotry is frowned upon. I cer-
tainly am glad that isn’t the case with many of my
gentleman friends here at Washington & Lee. I
recall particularly this year’s Halloween party.
One prankster came dressed as a KKK member
and had the crowd in stitches! I mean some blacks
are alright, but they aren't ‘‘niggers.** It was ter-
ribly fortunate when the patriotic citizens of For-
sythe County, Georgia reminded us that ignorant
racism is still fashionable in a great many places.
Indeed, the University itself seems to support our
prejudiced cause. W&L just skipped right over
Martin Luther King Day with hardly a notice. I,
myself, was not aware of the holiday until I de-
faced the public notice hanging in the Lexington
Post Office. Why, the administration even sche-
duled another lecture at the same time the campus
Minority Student Association sponsored Lexing-
ton’s only memorial service for Dr. King. I also
heard with great delight that a number of students
were encouraged to attend the former to fulfill
class requirements. | love university support! Of
course, animals are another matter. I love ani-
mals. There’s nothing quite as amusing as watch-
ing my favorite dog get hammered drinking the
beer in his watering dish. When the party gets
really wild, I might blow pot smoke in his face
just to see him stoned. I even remember earlier in
the year some guys on campus had a pet pig. It’s
too bad they dropped it trying to steal it back from
the SPCA (Society for the PREVENTION of

 

ceptables. I’ve heard rumors that in some parts of

LETTERS

Cruelty to Animals). I think one of the guys got in
trouble for paralysing the little sucker and is sup-
posed to present SPCA lectures at the university,
although I haven’t seen any notices yet. I’m sure
he feels really bad though. Finally, when the
weekend rolls around, I get to abuse some cheese
(the W&L gentleman’ s word for a lady). I never
wanted crack (another inspired euphemism) here
in the first place, and I certainly don’t intend to
accept them with any sort of tolerance and grace. I
don’t even consider the coeds unless they’re as
self-important as I, or they try to date some VMI
loser. Girls are only good for one thing anyway,
and if they play hard to get I just have to show
them some ‘‘rough love.‘* Heck, something con-
sidered as a felony in the outside world is rather
fun here at college. Most cheese deserves it any-
way, right? Well, I’ve truly enjoyed recapping my
career at Washington & Lee, and I wish future
classes as much fun as I’ve encountered here. The
most important thing to remember is never let the
open-minded, left-wing, humanitarians get to
you. They’re probably just here for academic
reasons anyway. Even my father used to say that
‘ta gentleman is someone who never hurts anyone
on purpose, because he’ll hurt enough people ac-
cidentally.‘‘Obviously, he did not foresee the
1980’s or the need to step on others in this dog-
eat-dog world of monetary indulgences. Thank
the Lord for Washington & Lee, where a student
can practice such intolerance and malignity before
entering the real world.
Callously Yours,

Challenge to Pimblett

To the editor:

Your first issue for 1988 included a very en-
lightening editorial by one of your staffers, Mar-
garet Pimblett. Her call for human rights activism
at W&L should be the battle cry for every socially
conscience student here. Her button should be the
beginning of a tradition of civil and human rights
demonstrations and statements for the student
body of this university.

W&L has a long standing tradition of conservat-
ism, but it is time for a change. Other great uni-
versities in this country have set the precedent. To
show our social awareness and concern for human
rights, some form of demonstration should be
made. Surely W&L students can understand that
their beautiful campus for which they pay a hea-

A letter of thanks for W&L’s special qualities

Ithy tuition is worth compromising for the right
cause. The Lexington news media could and
should be treated to the sudden appearance of a
‘*shanty town’’ or a student protest march in re-
sponse to Russia’s refusal to withdraw from Af-
ganistan immediately or the plight of the Polish
Solidarity movement. Human rights are being vio-
lated and it time for W&L to take notice and take
action!!

George Washington led Americans in our Revo-
lutionary War. He fought for freedom, liberty,
and basic human rights. Similar to our fore-
fathers fight for “‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness’’ is the struggle of the Nicaraguan free-
dom fighters. Can students here sit by and watch
these heroes of democracy die trying to gain hu-
man freedom and rights for their country? As stu-
dents at Washington and Lee, it is our duty and
honor to demonstrate our support for these defen-
ders of the rights of man.

I’m sure Miss Pimblett would agree that these
violations of human rights, while often forgotten
in the press, although undoubtedly not for politi-
cal reasons, are worthy of the attention and action
of the student body at W&L. And I challenge Miss
Pimblett to lead W&L into a new era of human
rights activism.

Cordially, Pat Heffernan ’91
Thanks MSA

To the editor:

I would like to thank the W&L Minority Stu-
dents Association for sponsoring the memorial
service held this past Monday evening in honor of
Dr. Martin Luther King’s birthday. I felt it was a
most fitting celebration of the life of the man and
the ideas for which he stood. In particular, I found
Reverand Robinson’s address most inspiring; it
made me think about both the great strides we
have taken and, even more, the necessary leaps
that must still be made before this country really is
a place where ‘‘all men are equal.’’ I was dis-
appointed, howeven in the low attendance by the
student body. Even if one did not wish to cele-
brate the life of Reverand King, it was more a cle-
bration of his ideas for equality, peace, and love. I
feel it would have said a lot for the student body to
have shown its support for these ideas. Again, I
thank those responsible for the service.

Sincerely,
Harley Walsh

Political analyst speaks to Convention leadership

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-Editor

Larry J. Sabato, associate professor
of government and foreign affairs at
the University of Virginia and one of
the country’s leading political
analysts, gave a workshop for state
and regional chairmen of the Mock
Convention on Saturday from | p.m.
to5 p.m.

Sabato gave a 45-minute general
lecture for the state chairmen and held
five half-hour question and answer
periods for each of the regions.

““T’ve really have heard about the

convention for years and I’ve read
about it and I’ve always been very im-
pressed by it,’’ said Sabato.

‘‘T wish that more universities had
something like this because it’s a mar-
velous tool for civic education. ”’

Sabato gave students an ‘‘overview
of the process’’ including ways to
make the most accurate prediction
possible.

Students should ‘‘talk to the politi-
cal people, rather than merely reading
news stories and so on.’’ He sug-
gested that students try to stay in close
contact with elected officials such as
congressmen and governors and their
staffs. These officials have ‘‘their ears
to the ground’’ and can offer the most

Rutigliano speaks on
drug and alcohol abuse

 

By Wendy Wolford
Staff Reporter

 

In the opinion of Sam Rutigliano,
former head coach of the Cleveland
Browns, America is fighting a losing
battle against drugs and alcohol. It is a
losing battle at this point because it is
a problem that most Americans will
not admit.

In his speech to kick off Drug and
Alcohol Awareness Week, Rutigliano
told his story. He began fighting back
against drugs by forming the Inner
Circle, a program designed to educate
his players about drugs and alcohol
abuse and to treat those who had a
problem.

The Inner Circle is actually an in-
vestment for the Cleveland Browns
because it has saved the lives of eleven
players to date and continues to work
successfully, said Rutigliano.

After one of his players came to him
with a drug problem, Rutigliano de-
cided to take action. With the help of
Dr. Greg Collins, a psychologist from
the Cleveland Clinic; Paul Warfield
and Calvin Hill, former NFL players;
and Tom Petersburg, a counselor for
Athletes in Action, Rutigliano formed
his team.

Speakers, including “toXicologists,
ex-addicts, and psychologists began
the program by educating the players
on the dangers of abuse. Once a player
admitted his problem, Rutigliano sent
him to a rehabilitation center for
treatment.

Unlike most NFL drug and alcohol
programs, the Inner Circle has an
after-care program as well. Though
weekly sessions with psychologists,
support group meetings and drug
screenings, the players are able to
continue their careers and move for-
ward with their lives, the coach said.

The main problem Rutigliano finds
in dealing with drug and alcohol abuse
is that it evolves from peer pressure.
Most of the players he has worked
with found the desire for peer appro-
val began in high school, and the prob-
lem intensified in college.

Once his players made the final cut
in the NFL, peer pressure continued;
however, the stakes in playing the
game now included cocaine. With the
salaries his players were making,
some were supporting habits of
$4,000 a week.

For the Cleveland Browns and oth-
ers influenced by his philosophy, Ru-
tigliano served as a father figure as
well as a friend. He finds it is best not
to moralize but to serve as a vehicle
for solving the problem. The solution
to the problem also lies in the indivi-
dual because, according to Rutigliano,
‘*the ones who fail choose to.”’

To Rutigliano education is the key
to ending the problem in America.
Although he is ‘no longer with the
Cleveland Browns, Rutigliano speaks
to students, church groups, and other
organizations nationwide. Currently
he is a football analyst for NBC and
hosts ESPN’s Monday Night Match-
Up.

accurate information.

Sabato said that although students
should pay attention to media cover-
age of the candidates, he cautioned
that they shouldn’t base their opinions
exclusively on information offered
from the media.

The biggest problem facing the
delegates is that the convention comes
so early in the race.

‘*T understand that they used to do it
in May. Now they're doing it in
March. They’re going to need a lot of
luck to pick the right candidate. At
that point, it may be so indeterminate
that it’s really impossible to know.”’

“I think if you got several hundred

of the top political analysts together at
that time, they would have a hard time
picking in March.””

Sabato was surprised by the turnout
for the workshop, which was com-
pletely voluntary.

‘*I’m impressed that so many people
are interested in politics to give up
their Saturday to show up.”’

‘*The quality of questions was very
high,’’ said Sabato, ‘‘They really
know their stuff.””

Chip Gist, political chairman of the
Mock Convention, said he was
pleased with the turnout. He estimated
that about 75 people participated in the
workshop.

‘*We want to give them every bit of

information we can, every opportun-
ity to find out the kind of information
that I certainly can’t give them. You
can ask Dr. Sabato about any state,
and he literally knows something
about every state. It was lucky that he
was so convenient.”

Gist said because response to this
workshop was so favorable, the Mock
Convention committee may ask Sa-
bato to conduct another workshop
after Super Tuesday, the day of pri-
maries in most southern states and
some states such as Massachusetts and
Hawaii.

The Executive Committee announ-
ced Monday night that it is re-opening
the call for applications for the White
Book Revisions Committee.

According the EC President Brad
Root, the call for applications was
closed about six weeks into the Fall
Term.

The applications are being re-
opened because the response to the
first call was so poor. At the end of
Fall Term, the EC had received about
10 applications. The White Book Re-
visions Committee will be made up of
12 students.

Root stressed the importance of the
committee.

“It is the best way to evaluate the
current student generation in relation
to the Honor System.”’

Additionally, Root said he will de-
sign an application form for students
to fill out. Students had previously
submitted a letter expressing their
wish to be considered for the commit-
tee.

Root said the forms will be ready by
the end of the week. They may be
picked up in Carol Calkins’ office in
the University Center.

Currently, he is conducting research
on campaign techniques, focusing on

Matthew Maury often overlooked among Lexington’s citizens

 

From Staff Reports

 

While the Rockbridge County area
: marks the well-known January birth-
' days of Robert E. Lee, Stonewall
’ Jackson, and Martin Luther King, an-
other important January birthday slips
by almost unnoted, despite lasting ties
with Virginia, especially Lexington.

Thursday, Jan. 14, marked the
182nd anniversary of the birth of
Commodore Matthew Fontaine
Maury, the ‘‘Pathfinder of the Seas,’’
and though he roamed far and wide in
his vigorous career, his life began and
ended in Virginia. It is an odd coinci-
dence that the birthdays of Jackson,
Lee, and Maury, three of Lexington’s
most noted former citizens, fall within
a span of eight days.

County, where Jackson was to die a

half-century later, the celebrated na-

life at VMI. It was here that Maury
died in 1873 in the parade ground re-
sidence into which he moved in 1868.
The house, now called the Maury
House, is among the buildings and re-
sidences cited in VMI’s designation as
a National Historic District.

Although in his lifetime he received
more recognition abroad than he did at
home, Maury in 1930 became the 68th
person to be enshrined in the Hall of
Fame of Great Americans.

Maury, whose family moved from
Virginia to Tennessee, had his first as-
sociation with Rockbridge County at
the age of 19 when he received a mid-
shipman appointment to the U.S.
Navy. It came through another mi-
grant Virginian, Tennessee Con-
gressman Sam Houston, a Rockbridge
native.

orate ceremony. He was, after all, an
international scientist whose charting
of wind and sea currents had made
him the world’s foremost authority on
the science of oceanography.

He published works on navigation,
naval reform, meteorology, and as-
tronomy; was a pioneer in deep-sea
soundings; envisioned the laying of
transoceanic cables; developed the
standard ship’s log; and crusaded for
establishment of a national weather
bureau.

He also advocated the establishment
of a school for young Naval officers,
and so it is for that he is sometimes re-
ferred to as the father of the U.S. Na-
val Academy.

The outbreak of the Civil War for-
ced Maury, like many service offi-

cers, to make the decision of first loy-
alty. Resigning his Navy commission
to return to Virginia, he was commis-
sioned in the Confederate Navy and
placed in charge of all coast, harbor,
and river defenses. It was during this
period that he invented an electric
mine for harbor defense.

Maury was in England when the

war ended, having been sent there as
an emissary to purchase ships and win
friends for the Southern cause. In
exile and financial ruin, he went from
England to Mexico, but nine months
later returned to England where, in
order to support his family, he gave
instructions and demonstrations in the
use of his electirc mines.

It was while Maury was in England
that he accepted an invitation to join
the faculty at VMI. Not burdened with
regular classroom teaching, he served
as a lecturer while preparing an elab-
orate physical survey of Virginia. The
completed survey was widely ac-

TALKBACK

Does anyone benefit from the drinking age being 21?

An example of this is the commit-
tee’s subscription to The Presidential
Campaign Hotline, a daily publication
produced in McLean.

The Hotline, which is sent to W&L
through a computer modem, is a
pamphlet detailing all the current
news in both the Republican and De-
mocratic campaigns.

The Hotline is divided into three
sections; a summary of news stories,

claimed and became an important
element in the completion of the Che-
sapeake and Ohio Railroad.

In his lectures at VMI, Maury often
stressed the benefits of accurate time,
and as a result, the Institute began fir-
ing a gun at midday, a practice that
was lauded as a public service. His ar-
rival also revived interest in weather
records, and since 1869 daily weather
charts have been kept in Lexington.

In an effort to help the Southern
farmer, Maury championed estab-
lishment of a more effective weather
bureau in Washington, making the In-
stitute’s chair of physics a nationally
known source for ideas on the weath-
ef.

He traveled and lectured in every

kings and emperors, for the advances
he brought to agriculture. He had just
addressed agricultural organizations
in Massachusetts and Missouri in the
fall of 1872 when illness forced his re-
turn home. He died quietly at his VMI
quarters on February 1, 1873.

Through Maury’s birthday may be

Goshen Pass, where the Maury River
forms a pass between the mountains, a
monument is erected to the memory of
Maury, ‘‘the genius who first snat-
ched from ocean and atmosphere the
secret of their laws.’’ A ship’s anchor
lies appropriately alongside.

In Lexington, a street bears his
name, as does the old science building
at VMI and the parade ground quar-
ters he once called home. In VMI’s
Preston Library is a replica of sculptor
William Sievers’ heroic seated statue
of Maury, and near the library is an
equatorial sundial commemorating his
scientific achievements.

 

Hotline

 

(\Continued from page 3

Convention media chairman, the main
advantage of the Hotline is ‘‘it is so
timely.”

It gives students information from
all over the country in one lump, said
Bolling. ‘‘It compares what the Wash-
ington Post and the New York Times
have to say in the same paragraph.”’

According to Gist, the Hotline has
been helpful in political research, by

allowing students to follow traveling
candidates in various regional news-
papers.

Gist said the Mock Convention
committee subscribed to the Hotline in
October after Professor William Con-
nelly suggested it might be helpful.
Mock Convention has received the
Hotline daily since Nov. 1.

There are several copies available
for the use of students involved in

versity Library on cage reserve, one
in the Commerce School Library, and
one in the Mock Convention office.

Pusey speaks on W&L’s
role in works of fiction

 

By Melinda Conkling
Staff Reporter

 

Upon leaving college, graduates
often feel many conflicting emotions
towards their alma mater. Sometimes
the magnitude of these emotions leads
one to write about their college expe-
riences, be it with irony, civility, or
indifference. :

On Jan. 18, Professor emeritus Wil-
liam H. Pusey III presented a paper in
Northen Auditorium on men who have
graduated from W&L and collected
their memoirs in a novel.

Many professors, alumni, and
townspeople gathered to hear Pusey
speak on fiction written about or men-
tioning W&L. ‘‘There seem to be no
truly great college novels,’’ began
Pusey.

Nonetheless, there has been enough
material written on W&L that Pusey
was able to present a paper on novels
dealing with the school.

The first time W&L was ever men-
tioned in a novel was in 1842, by Wil-
liam A. Caruthers’ Love and Con-
sumption. The most recent novel

about W&L was a French best-seller,
L’Etudiant Etranger, that was pub-
lished in 1986. The author was a
W&L student who wrote, according to
Pusey, ‘‘an affirmative and pleasing
novel about Washington & Lee Uni-
versity’’.

Not all books on W&L have been
affirmative and pleasing. One novel in
particular, Jessamine by Marion Har-
land, gave a scathing depiction of
W&L.

The novels, often retrospective and
memorable, that Pusey talked about
were written between 1940 and 1986
and according to Pusey they tended to
view W&L as a gentleman’s school.

Said Pusey, “I read L’Etudiant
Etranger and this made me interested
in researching other books that have
been written about W&L and thus,
this paper’’.

Pusey’s closing was an invitation to
someone, man or woman, to write
about the manifold of changes that
have taken place at W&L over the past
few years.

The books mentioned in the paper
are on exhibit in the Boatwright Room
of the library through March.

 

MSA celebrates MLK Day

 

By Dana Bolden
Staff Reporter

 

Many members of the Lexington
community, W&L and VMI gathered
together Monday night at the First
Baptist Church to celebrate the birth-
day of the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr.

The program, which was sponsored
by the Minority Student Association
of W&L and Promaji at VMI, fea-
tured choral selections by the Gospel
Way Choir and the W&L Woman's
Chorus.

Many students spoke during the
program, providing excerpts of some
of King’s most famous speeches.

The featured speaker at the event
was the Rev. Haywood Robinson, Jr.
pastor of the Diamond Hill Baptist
Church in Lynchburg, who was also a
close personal friend of King.

Robinson received his B.A. from
Hampton University and his doctor of
divinity from the Virginia Seminary.
He conducted post- graduate studies at
Oberlin University. He is currently

the executive director of the Lynch-
burg Community Action Project and
is a member of the National Confer
ence of Christians and Jews.

In his speech, Haywood highlighted
some of King’s accomplishments. He
went on to tell the audience that
‘‘Martin knew _ that words were
powerful, but he knew that he must
back his words up with actions.”’
Haywood continued by asking the au-
dience that they follow that same ex-
ample.

Haywood also challenged the au-
dience to ‘‘use their bodies as vehicles
for the [King’s] dream.’’ He finished
his speech with a dynamic rendition of
King’s ‘“‘I have a dream”’ speech that
brought the church to its feet.

After Haywood'’s speech, many
students from both W&L and VMI
were recognized as outstanding §stu-
dents by W&L’s dean of minority af-
fairs Anece McCloud.

According to MSA member Mike
Webb, the program was more than a
success. Said Webb, ‘‘This is a great
way to bring the community, W&L
and VMI together all at the same
time.”’

Juniors offer chartered trip

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

While slushing through last week’s
snow, W&L students may have no-
ticed posters around campus advertis-
ing Barefoot Cruises.

Barefoot Cruises offers W&L stu-
dents an opportunity to spend either
February or Spring break on a 45-foot
Shocker Motorsailer leisurely sailing
around the Florida Keys.

But apparently students were dis-
interested in fishing, diving, windsurf-
ing, and skiing because W&L juniors
Bill Crabill and Mike Drusano, cap-
tain and first mate, received only one
phone call in response to the adver-
tisements they hung up around cam-
pus.

The one interested party who did
call was a Hollins student. Crabill ex-
plained to her that ‘‘the charter is open
to Hollins students’’ but he could not

take her and her friends during her
break because he would be in school.

Concerning why no one else expres-
sed interest in the trip, Canbill said,
‘‘part of the problem for the February
break is that everyone had already
made plans before I put the posters up,
and now it’s a little too early to be
thinking about April break.’’

Crabill has already made plans to go
skiing in February, but still offers his
services as a breakfast and lunch chef
as well as captain of his father’s boat,
Sonshine, during April.

‘*The idea [to offer the charter] real-

ly stemmed from last spring. I took ”

four friends from here to the Baha-
mas. We ended up meeting seven girls

from LSU on a chartered yacht in Bi- *

mini. We had a great time!’’ Crabill
explained.

Crabill also said that the ‘‘intention ”

was to take five girls not five guys,

because five girls look a lot better in |

bikinis than five guys.”’

Erfglish exchange

University College, Oxford, has
invited W&L to send one student
each year for a year-long exchange
program in some area in which a
tutor is available on the university
faculty. The program is designed
for students in their junior year but
in exceptional cases a senior may
be considered. (The Oxford aca-

The Ring-tum Phi, January 21, 1988, Page 5

demic year runs from the first of
October until late in June so it
would be very difficult for a senior
to complete the required work in
time for graduation here.)

To be considered, the student
should be in the upper quintile in
class rank; a junior; able to com-
plete the general education re-
quirements for the degree in the
remaining time at W&L; planning
to take work in a discipline in
which University has available tu-
tors; able to present a program of
studies suitable to the major de-
partment concerned and to the For-
eign Studies Committee; involved
in extra-or co-curricular activities;
and committed to staying for the
whole academic year.

Nominations by faculty mem-
bers are due by Feb. |. A letter of
recommendation should be in-
cluded with the nomination. The

   

letter should be addressed to: Wil-
liam J. Watt, Chairman; Universi-
ty Student-Exchange Committee;
Howe Hall. After an initial screen-
ing the committee will interview
finalists in February.

As in other exchange programs,
the student involved remains enrol-
led at W&L and therefore would
continue to receive any financial
aid to which he or she is entitled. In
addition, W&L will provide a
$2,000 scholarship to help with
transportation and personal expen-
ses. The student would pay tuition
and living expenses to University.

Credit for work at Oxford would
be assigned by the student’s major
department after evaluating the
work carried out during the year at
Oxford. No grades will be trans-
ferred for the work.

For additional information,
please consult Professor Watt.

Whether a glass holds 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1'/4 ounces of spirits, the alcohol
content is the same. It’s important to know this because the size and shape of the glass can give
people a distorted impression of how much alcohol they’re actually drinking.

So when you're out to share some cheer with friends, remember how much alcohol is in your

Hancock nets

1000th point;

Generals crush Maroons

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

What a wild and wooly week it was
for the W&L basketball team.

In the span of seven days, the Gen-
erals whipped Roanoke 82- 72, senior
guard Steve Hancock scored his
| OOOth-career point and the team got
in a fight during an 83-80 win over
Eastern Mennonite that resulted in
three players being ejected from the
game. In the process, the squad upped
it’s record to 12-2, 3-2 in the Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference. Let's try
to sort this whole mess out.

First things first. The Generals flew
into last Thursday's game at the War-
ner Center against Roanoke on the
wings of a four- game winning streak
and the Maroons were not about to
ground them. It was W&L’s game
from the opening tipoff as the Gen-
erals raced out to an early 8-2 lead.
Despite the antics of a near- capacity
crowd, everything was pretty much
under control. That was, however, un-
til the 3:13 mark of the first half.

At that point, Roanoke’s leading
scorer, Charles Small, picked up his
third personal foul. Roanoke head
coach Ed Green became upset, which
is a vast understatement. Green picked
up a technical foul, but even that
didn’t deter him from leaving the
coach’s box, going up to the scorer’s
table and generally causing confusion

and havoc for the officials running the
game.

 

Meanwhile, the Generals stayed
calm, mainly because their head
coach, Verne Canfield, remained al-
most silent throughout the entire
proceedings. The strategy worked, for
when play resumed, W&L held on to
its lead and went into the locker room
at halftime with a 36-30 advantage.

Green continued to stir up trouble in
the second half, but the poised Gen-
erals, who at one point had four
freshmen on the floor, were never ser-
iously threatened the rest of the way.
The play of the freshmen was the key
as W&L got excellent performances
from forward Chris Jacobs (13 points
on 13-14 shooting from the free-throw
line) and the backcourt tandem of
guards Mike Holton and Jim Casey.
Freshman forward Ed Hart, on an off-
night for him, still contributed 12
points and 5 rebounds. Hancock led
all scorers with 17 points, as well as
grabbing a team-high 8 boards.

‘It was a total team effort,’’ said
Canfield. ‘‘We followed the game
plan almost to a ‘T’. It was pleasing
that we were mentally tough and it
was pleasing that we weren’t intimi-
dated.””

Unfortunately for the Generals,
they couldn’t savor the victory for
very long. W&L traveled to Emory
and Henry on Saturday night to take
on the physical Wasps, and the Gen-
erals lost 79-69.

Canfield did not start either Han-
cock or senior center Harmon Harden
in the E&H game for reasons he called
a ‘‘family matter.‘‘ With four fresh-

Grapplers grab fourth place

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

The W&L wrestling team made a
solid showing this past Saturday,
grabbing fourth place in the ten-team
Lebanon Valley Dual-Meet Invita-
tional. '

The Generals got off to a good start,
beating host Lebanon Valley 30-12 in
the first round. Senior Kevin McNa-
mara, with a pin at 167 Ibs., and
sophomore Lee Garlove, with a 15-3
decision at 142, led W&L.

In all, the Generals won six of the
10 weight classes. Also winning for
W&L was senior Steve Castle at 126,
senior John Lowe at 134, freshman
Mark Monahan by forfeit at 158 and
junior George Loupassi at 190.

Things then got real tough in the
semifinals. The Generals got crushed
42-3 by Lycoming. Garlove, who
went undefeated in his three matches
at the invitational, had the lone
triumph, a hard-fought 4-3 victory at
142.

Lycoming narrowly won the first
two weight classes, with freshman
Larry Pilkey and Castle getting edged
by one and two points respectively,
but then dominated the remaining
matches. Lycoming would score two
pins and four technical falls in the next
eight classes, with Garlove and Lou-
passi the only ones able to go the dis-
tance of three periods.

Kings was the W&L’s next oppo-
nent in the battle for third place, and
the Generals came up on the short end
of the 28-17 score. After three conse-
cutive decisions by Castle, Lowe and
Garlove, W&L had an 11-6 lead. It

was short lived as Kings went right
back on top with a pin at 150 and a
technical fall at 158. The Generals
fought back with two more decisions
to tie the match at 17-17 going into the
final two classes. But Kings closed out
the competition with another technical
fall and another pin, insuring W&L of
a fourth-place finish.

This Saturday, the Generals play
host in the W&L Invitational Tourna-
ment in the Warner Center, starting at
9:00 a.m. W&L’s wrestlers will com-
pete against Davidson, Furman,
Gardner-Webb, Gettysburg, Johns
Hopkins, Longwood and Newport
News Apprentice.

Swimming: SU is too tough

 

From Staff Reports

 

The W&L men’s swim team lost its
first meet of the season when Division
II Shippensburg came into Cy Twom-
bly Pool last Friday and defeated the
Generals 100-75.

‘‘Shippensburg is a dynamic pro-
gram with quality swimmers,’’ said
head coach Page Remillard. ‘‘Still, I
am pleased with many of our swims.”’

Remillard had to be pleased with the
performance of sophomore Shawn

Copeland. For the second-consecutive
week, Copeland was W&L’s top
swimmer. He won the 200-yard
breaststroke with a time of 2:15.25
and was second in the 200-yard indi-
vidual medley with a time of 2:01.59.
In the previous meet against George-
town, Copeland won three events to
lead the Generals, now 2-1 on the
season, to victory.

W&L also got some excellent
efforts from senior Simon Perez and
juniors Moose Herring and David
Dietz. Perez won the 100- yard frees-
tyle with a time of 49.25 and was part
of the General’s winning 400-yard
freestyle relay team. Herring claimed
first place in the 200-yard backstroke

with a time of 2:08.06 and Dietz tou-
ched out three Shippensburg swim-
mers to narrowly win the 50-yard
freestyle with a time of 22.62.

Shippensburg’s depth proved to be
the deciding factor in the meet. The
Generals won five of the 11 races, but
Shippensburg grabbed two of the top
three places in seven of the events.
The 200- and 500-yard freestyles were
dominated by Shippensburg as it took
all three places in each event.

Both the W&L men and women
teams will compete at home against —
Johns Hopkins this Friday. The meet,

‘which will be held in Cy Twombly

Pool, begins at 6:00 p.m.

‘ftiendly game with the Royals of
Eastern Mennonite (3-10 overall, 0-5
ig the ODAC). Hancock was five
points shy of 1,000 for his career.
Sounds like a nice easy win for the
Generals and night to celebrate Han-
cock’s achievement, right? Wrong.
“The Royals played extremely well,
led by the inspired play of Eugene Bal-
timore (11 points, 5 assists), who, at
times, looked like a shorter version of
dohnny Dawkins, and the sharpshoot-
ing Gary Chupp (game-high 27 points
6n 8 for 11 shooting). The Generals
were able to build a comfortable lead
of six points, but could never deliver
the knockout punch. The first half
ended with W&L leading 39-33.
Hancock was, so far, the only high-
light of the General’s evening. With
just over five minutes remaining in the
first half, Hancock tossed in a three-
point rainbow that almost scraped the
' metal beams of the gym ceiling. The
| pot of gold at the end of the shot were
career points 998, 999 and 1000, mak-
‘ing Hancock just the 14th player in
W&L history to reach the coveted
plateau.
* The game was uneventful for the
first 17 minutes of the second half,
with the Generals still maintaining a
=~ +six-point advantage. Then came abso-
lute mayhem.
Senior forward Gary Schott and
‘Royal forward Norris Bethea became
,entangled, with both players crashing
to the floor. Schott was called for the
*personal foul, but Bethea and Schott
_ Were engaging in fisticuffs before the
officials could step in. In fact, the
‘officials, inexplicably. did nothing
, to stop the fight. As both players con-
tinued to tussle, the players on the
* floor jumped in. Finally. after a cou-
_ ple of minutes had passed, the offi-
cials finally restored order to the situa-
* tion,

Then, after at least tn interminable
minutes of discussion, ¢ame the calls.
Schott and Hart were both given two-

, shot flagrant fouls anc ejected from
the game, although Har was not even
involved in the fight. For Eastern

_ Mennonite, Baltimore “who did not
throw a punch) and no! Bethea, was
given a two-shot flagrint foul and

_ ejected from the gamé For good
measure, the officials Man assessed

; technical fouls to Canfield and

‘‘Don’t ask me to explain it,”’ said
Canfield. ‘‘I can only stand so long
and see my guy get pummelled and
then I got to go on the floor.”’

Then, after even more discussion,
came the foul shots. Bethea hit the two
free throws for the first foul (the Gen-
erals were in the penalty situation) and
then Chupp hit all four free throws for
the two flagrant fouls. Hancock then
hit 1 of 2 for the Royal’s flagrant foul
and the General’s six-point lead had
evaporated to just one. The officials
said the technical fouls on both coa-
ches cancelled each other out, so
neither team shot free throws for those
two calls.

The result of the whole incident was
that Eastern Mennonite suddenly had
a chance to win the game. The Gen-
erals were still leading by one until
Eric Kurtz’s layup gave the Royals the
lead with thirteen seconds left. Junior
guard Emmanuel Klump brought the
ball up for W&L, drove into the lane
and somehow drew a foul with :02
showing on the clock as he flung the
ball toward the basket.

Klump, for the second week in a
row, nailed the clutch free throws.
After the Royals threw the ball away,
Holton hit two more foul shots and the
Generals escaped with an 83-80 vic-
tory.

Canfield was not pleased. ‘‘I sure
don’t see team defense, I'll tell you
that. That bothers me. I’m really upset
with the way we've been playing. It’s
almost like ‘Okay, we've beat Roan-
oke, that’s it guys, that’s the season.’
Roanoke wasn't the team to beat this
year, folks.”

The team to beat this year is
Bridgewater and that’s whom the Gen-
erals face tonight on the road. Led by
last year’s ODAC Player-of-the- Year
Ramsey Yeatts, Bridgewater is cur-
rently 13-1 overall, undefeated in the
ODAC and ranked 6th in the nation in
Division ILI to boot.

“They have five guys who play
very well together,”’ said Canfield,
‘‘and they look to their aircraft carrier
to go ahead and score. If he’s on, they
find him. If our team wants a chal-
lenge, they got it.”’

HOOKSHOTS—Hancock continues
to be the General’s leading scorer,
averaging just under 18 points per
contest... Tonight’s Bridgewater
game will be broadcast live on 91.5
WLUR. Coverage begins at 7:20...
The Generals have an unusual Sunday
afternoon game against Maryville at
3:00 p.m. at the Warner Center.
W&L then goes back on the road to
take on the Tigers at Hampden- Syd-
ney on Tuesday...

Words in Edgewise

Answers to Your Musical Questions

 

By Marshall Boswell
Staff Reporter

 

Every year about this time, we are
smothered by Top Ten lists of every
imaginable species, so | swear to God
that this little trifle of a piece will be
nothing of the sort. What this is,
rather, is an answer to all those Top
Fen lists. My primary launching pad
is this: a concise, exhaustive listing of
the sort previously indicated breeds on
exclusion and conciseness, which
means that a great deal is left unsaid.
It is nice to be reminded about how
many hit singles U2 scored last year,
but wasn't there a question lurking in
your head that first time you listened
to The Joshua Tree, a question that
never quite got answered? That is, be-
fore we compile that last list,
shouldn’t we ask those important
questions that have hounded us all
year?

Well, yeah. Or at least that’s what
this article is going to do. You see,
one of the advantages of writing a
column based on its writer’s utterly
unsolicited views is that the above said
writer also gets the opportunity to
engage in this kind of equally unsoli-
cited exercise--that is, the airing of
questions not answered by year-end
Top Ten lists. These particular ques-
tions concern the world of popular

Faust Food

music, but I urge you, patient reader,
to feel free and apply this endeavor to
any discipline or area in which ques-
tions like the following rear their
unanswered head.

And away we go.

1. Is there actually a living, breath-
ing, eating, excreting human complex
organism named Whitney Houston or
is this woman we’ ve all been watching
open-mouthed for the last year or so
simply the result of some as yet unex-
plained, simultaneous nationwide fan-
tasy?

2. Speaking of fantasies, does
Sheena Easton actually offer the none-
too-unarousing invitation, ‘‘Let’s get
to rammin’*‘ on that last Prince single
or was that too just another example of
an as yet unexplained et cetera?

3. Since we're still speaking of fan-
tasies, is Madonna becoming what we
mean when we use the term ‘‘anato-
mically correct?**

4. Speaking of anatomies, someone
who’s met her please tell me if Janet
Jackson is actually as cotton-candy
chubby as she sometimes lets on in all
those quick-edit videos. Then tell me
you're only kidding, since we haven't
left this area of fantasies.

5. Speaking of Jacksons, is that real-
ly brother Michael out there or has he
been replaced by some alien life-form
whose facial structure seems to be
fighting a losing battle with our ten-

uous atmosphere?

6. Still on the subject of Michael
Jackson, am I the only person who
finds it slightly disconcerting that the
Odd One opens his latest album with
the lyric, ‘You're butt is mine‘*‘?

7. And speaking of rock star butts,
what demographic audience is George
Michael aiming for with that ludicrous
shot of his blue-jeaned bottom at the
beginning of his latest video? Does the
answer to this have anything to do
with the perfectly- groomed hairdres-
ser razor stubble and the pearls dan-
gling daintily from George’s manly
leather jacket?

8. Speaking of leather jackets, why
is Billy Idol still alive and currently
breathing our tenuous atmosphere? I
mean, have we really been bad enough
to deserve this?

9. Why is Heart still et cetera?

10. Why is John Cougar Mellen-
camp still et cetera?

11. Why is John Bon Jovi still et
cetera?

12. Speaking of deserving some-
thing, what is the difference between
Debbie Gibson or Tiffany and any
other mindless, sixteen year-old Mall
Rat with a shapely teen butt? Besides a
hit record, of course, which is the
whole point.

13. Speaking of missed points, just
what is ‘‘pseudo-Dead- headness‘*?

14. Speaking of Dead-heads, does it

bother that portion of the Grateful
Dead faithful who give up their
money, intellect and ambition in the
name of Dead-headness that their
heroes have become extremely wea-
Ithy capitalists in the name of mis-
guided, knee-jerk sixties idealism?

15. Speaking of idealism, sure U2 is
great and mean well and all that, but
has anyone resolved in his/her mind
the fact that nearly ninety-percent of
the songs on the new album use the
exact same chords?

16. Speaking of the same chords,
are Motley Crue, Poison and Cindere-
lla actually the same four people wear-
ing different clothes at the appropriate
times?

17. Speaking of appropriate times,
are we really rid of Dweezil Zappa?

18. Speaking of inappropriate
times, are we really going to have to
deal with Boston again?

19. Or Aerosmith?

20. And finally, at this inappro-
priate time, I thought I would inap-
propriately leave you, patient reader,
with a Top Five list of the best records
of the past year--all of them, interest-
ingly enough, two record sets: The
Smiths, Louder Than Bombs, The
Cure, Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me;
Prince, Sign O’ the Times; Husker
Du, Warehouse: Songs and Stories;
and Sting, ... Nothing Like the Sun.
No question about it.

Stop-In is more than just a pit stop

 

By Jason Faust
Food Critic

It’s inevitable; we just can’t avoid
it. Every W&L student eventually
makes the trek down to that heavenly
mecca of food and gasoline, Stop-In.
In fact, I believe that Greg, my faith-
ful side-kick connoisseur, and I have
become addicted to the chili- cheese
dogs made fresh right before our eyes.
I would even go so far as to attribute
restless nights to a failure to inhale a
steaming chili-cheese dog, made by
my personal favorite Cheryl, while
watching ‘‘Late Night.’’ Greg has re-
ported similar reactions though a bit
more severe.

But you know, and there are many
non-believers out there, the dogs are

just the tip of delectable iceberg of
foods found at Stop-In. A plethora of
palatable delights are to be found in
the refrigerator which also houses a
veritable cornucopia of domestic and
imported beers. I wish I could de-
scribe how glorious Chineses History
was on Thursday mornings after eat-
ing half of a chicken salad sandwich
and half a pimento cheese sandwich
from Stop-In washed down with a Diet
Coke, of course.

Recently a burning issue has divided
many of the Stop-In regulars, myself
included. The issue is between the
‘One Stop’’ Stop-In brand sandwi-
ches and the Johnson’s brand sandwi-
ches-- which is best? I have always
been a devout consumer of Johnson’s
but I must admit that Stop-In’s pi-

mento cheese sandwiches simply are
the best. Greg has and probably al-
ways will argue in favor of Johnson’s
but I think he simply doesn’t want to
admit that I’m right. Oh well, it is a
matter of individual taste. I just hope I
don’t lose any more sleep over this is-
sue.

But to be serious, really. Though I
don’t think it is humanly possible for
others to enjoy Stop-In as much as
Greg and I do, Stop-In does offer a
quick and inexpensive dining alterna-
tive. It can also be fun if you take the
time to talk with Cheryl, Bird, Alice,
Jackie, and all the other friendly peo-
ple who work there. About the food,
well...it’s microwave food. What
more can be said about it. The chili-
cheese dogs and the recently added

barbeque are excellent. The sandwi-
ches in the refrigerator vary from cold
Italian subs to sausage and egg bis-
cuits. Particular favorites of mine are
always the Johnson’s cheeseburgers,
hot ham and cheese and the chicken
salad. On some days I enjoy the Beef
and Onion but other days I don’t. I
would not recommend the steak sand-
wich, the bagelwurst, or the tuna sa-
lad.

Stop-In is a convenience store sup-
plying W&L, VMI, and the commun-
ity with goods and gasoline, but re-
member the food. It’s cheap (nothing
is over $2) and many evenings the
walk down from the hill has proved a
great way to blow off a little steam as

well as nourishing your body with a
little ‘‘brain food.”’

Trustees to discuss budget
and fraternity renaissance

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-Editor

 

The Fraternity Renaissance Pro-
gram and the University Budget are
among the items that W&L’s Board of
Trustees will discuss at their Winter
meeting, which will be held on cam-
pus Friday and Saturday.

The Board will be given a report on
the Fraternity Renaissance Program,
drawn up by the Fraternity House
Renovation Steering Committee and
presented by President John D. Wil-
son, said Farris Hotchkiss, secretary
to the Board. The report will concen-
trate on the goals set forth in the re-
cently published Washington and Lee
Standards for Fraternities and is one
of the Board’s ‘‘main agenda items.”’

‘‘Also, at this board meeting, the

Board begins looking at next year’s

educational and general budget,’’ said
Hotchkiss. The Board will set
“*general parameters’’ for the budget,
which will be finalized at the Board’s
meeting in May. The Board will also
discuss the University’s endowment
program and the effect of the stock
market crash on the University’s port-
folio, said Hotchkiss.

Construction and development of
the University’s campus and facilities
are also on the agenda. The Board is
expected to tour the recently reno-
vated Alumni house, Gilliam house,
which houses the Admissions office,
and newly-constructed Gaines Resi-
dence Hall. Progress on fund-raising
for the performing arts center will also
be discussed.

Among the other issues set for the
meeting are any faculty summer
leaves or grants, any honorary de-

grees to be presented in June, and any
possible candidates that may be nomi

nated to the Board

J. William McClintock III, Class of
1953, will be sworn in a trustee
during the Board’s meeting. McClin
tock was elected to the Board at its Oc
tober meeting in Williamsburg. His
election brought the number of
trustees to 28. According to Hotchk
iss, there can be no more than 30
members, each who may serve for
two five-year terms, on the board.

For the first time on record, the
W&L Board of Trustees will meet
with VMI’s Board of Visitors for a
dinner at VMI’s Moody Hall Friday
evening. The dinner is a result of the
suggestion of Joseph Spivey, current
chairman of VMI's Board and an
alumnus of W&L’s law school. Ac

Art show begins Arlington Center’s grand opening

By Jessica Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

‘‘Development of An Artist’” was
the title of the lecture Kathleen Olson-
Janjie gave Monday night in honor of
the grand opening of the Arlington
Women’s Center at W&L.

Olson, an assistant professor, came
to the university from Louisiana this
year. She teaches drawing and paint-
ing.

Olson is a native of California. She
comes from a family of artists and was
most influenced by her grandmother,
who she spent a lot of time watching
paint, she said.

Counselor
lectures on

alcoholism >

 

By Andy Nixon
Staff Reporter

 

As a featured event during last
week’s drug and alcohol awareness
program, substance abuse counselor
Bob Lynn spoke last Thursday in Lee
Chapel.

Lynn’s program emphasized the
area of addiction to, and new treat-
ment for, drug and alcohol victims.

Beginning the program, Lynn spoke
of his previous battle with alcoholism.

‘*The last thing I ever would have
believed is that I would be an alcoho-
lic,’’ he said. He went on to say, ‘‘The
hardest part is to admit that you have a
problem.’’ He added that in the end,
“‘T was grateful for having admitted to
that problem.”’

Lynn now has been a recovering al-
coholic for ten years, and he told the
audience his reason for coming was,
‘*The more we know about addiction
the better we can help ourselves.”’

Moving to addiction, Lynn cited
studies that revealed ‘‘70 percent of
Americans drink, with one out of sev-
en becoming alcoholics.’

Of those who become alcoholics,
however, Lynn stated that ‘‘the aver-
age alcoholic affects seven other peo-
ple with their alcoholism. *’ Lynn went
through the stages of a developing al-
coholic.

Olson received her B.A. at Ber-
keley, did her graduate study at Pratt
Institute in New York, got her MFA at
Yale and studied in Kasterlee, Bel-
gium.

Her works are on exhibit in the Ar-
lington Center as part of the opening
and can be seen through Feb. 6.

The exhibit is a collection of works
starting from her junior year in high
school continuing through her years of
influence from her travels in Europe.

Olson said that she is glad that she
was chosen to be the first event to
celebrate the opening of the center and
“it is great that the women have a
place they can go now.””

Among those who attended the ex-
hibit was president John Wilson, who
said he was very impressed with OI-
son’s work.

Although it was the president's first
visit to the center, he said he hoped to
visit again.

Wilson felt the center was an asset
for the campus.

‘Everyone needs space to get
together. The fraternity serves that
purpose just as the Chavis House is
available for the minority students and
the International House is available
for the international students,’ he
said.

Wilson said that he supports the

center because ‘‘I am interested in the
programs that interest women and
want to help the transition into coedu-
cation,”’ he said.

“*T think it (the center) will be good
for students off campus and freshman
too. It is a nice place to have,‘ said
Catherine Councill, a junior at the
university.

Councill said she is glad that the
school hired someone like Olson to
teach.

“She specializes in painting and
drawing which are the basic funda-
mentals of art,’’ she said.

“It is a nice alternative to studying
rather than in the library, as well as

**First,’” Lynn said, ‘‘is increased
tolerance,’’ resulting in the drinker
not being able to predict the number of
drinks it takes to reach a level of intox-
ication reached before. Consequently,
drinkers drink more which leads to al-
coholism. A true sign of alcoholism
then arrives, according to Lynn, in the
form of denial.

Denial is progressive, Lynn indi-
cated by saying, ‘*As alcoholism pro-
gresses, denial of a problem gets
stronger. ””

Bias lectures in Lee Chapel

By Francis Coryell
Staff Reporter

 

W&L’s Alcohol and Drug Aware-
ness Week concluded on Friday with
the appearance before a full Lee
Chapel crowd of Lonise Bias.

She is the mother of Len Bias, the
University of Maryland basketball star
who died of a cocaine overdose last
year.

The topics Bias talked about ranged
from peer pressure to AIDS, drugs to
suicide.

Bias approached the topics with a
religious tone. ‘‘I love you through
Jesus Christ. That God took one man
to save others. God has given me
strength for the mission,’’ were some
of the phrases she used in her speech.

Bias often used current songs and
videos to illustrate her points.

Citing the Michael Jackson video,
‘*Bad,”’ in which Jackson refuses to
attack an old man, she warned the au
dience; ‘‘Don’t confuse peer pressure
with friendship.”

She showed peer
brings us down. She then borrowed a
phrase from a Whitney Houston song

how pressure

‘The greatest love of all’’ is the love
for one’s self, she said.

Bias said that love for one’s self tea-
ches us that the material things in
one’s life are unimportant.

‘You have to know who you are,”’
she said. ** Alcohol and drugs are only
the symptoms. ”’

In her speech, Bias mentioned that
during the numerous stops at different
shows, she has met many people who
have faced harder ordeals than her
self. Although she had to bury her son
on national _ television, said
‘There are alweys people in worse
shape.”’

Once kids came up to her mention
ing these problems, she realized that

she

she needed to include other topics in
her seminat. Also, she said those who
have come up to her and thanked her
after her shows have helped her to
keep guing

Afier the speech Bias she
thought more education was needed

said
Drug education should start at home

she said, and parents especially need
to become more educated

See Bias, page 5

Lynn went on to describe the
reasons why a person becomes an al-
coholic. *‘Often a parent was an alco-
holic,’’ Lynn said. He added, ‘40 to
50 percent of children of alcoholics
either become an alcoholic, marry an
alcoholic, or have emotional prob-
lems.”

So what should a friend do?

Lynn said that most friends ‘‘keep
people sick by rescuing the people.”’
The best action a friend can do is get

help.

Lynn mentioned a method of inter-
vention, where all of the friends, fami-
ly and other concerned people con-
front the alcoholic to talk together
about the problem.

He also mentioned the Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings as well as the
ALANON meetings, an organization
for family and friends of alcoholics.
Both of these organizations old regu-
lar meetings in Lexington, and coun-
seling is available in the university or
in the Lexington area.

having a place to relax instead of your
own living room,’’ said Alexa Salz-
man, a junior at the university.

Salzman said the center also gives
the women an opportunity to hold
functions and meetings. It is a central
location for a lot of activities, she
said.

Meredith Walker, manager of the
center, said that the opening was set
up to make people more aware of what
the center has to offer.

As part of the events planned for the
center, movies will be shown every
Wednesday night, which should pro-
vide an alternative for women.

Brown Bag Lunch, which Walker

hopes will become a regular feature,
will be held during lunch time to dis
cuss issues on the campus and topics
affecting women.

Walker said that other activities are
being planned but are not definite

She wants to encourage people to
feel free to bring in suggestions.

Groups currently using the center to
hold meetings and receptions are Peer
Counseling, Big Brother/Little Sister,
Trident and the Women’s Faith
Group.

“IT hope that after women are more
aware of what is down here for them,
they will take advantage of it,’’ said
Walker.

Gaines Hall still
nearly completed

 

By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

 

Last November, Assistant Dean of
Students Ken Ruscio predicted that the
finishing touches on Gaines Residence
Hall -- primarily the completion of the
gatehouse -- would be completed by
Dec.1.

Almost two months have passed
since that deadline, and although
much construction has been completed
since then, Gaines Residence Hall still
remains incomplete.

Assistant Superintendent of Build-
ings and Grounds Scott Beebe said
Tuesday that the gatehouse of Gaines
Hall should be ready for use by stu-
dents within two weeks. He said car-
peting is expected to be put down
within the week and furniture is sche-
duled to be delivered as soon as next
Monday.

The rotunda of the gatehouse, when
completed, will feature several guest
speakers and frequent discussions as
well as serving as a meeting place for
Gaines Hall residents.

Although the gatehouse is still being
finished, many of the building’s ame-
nities — such as an exercise room,
computer room and laundromat — are
in current use by students.

The exercise room, which features
several Nautilus machines, bicycles
and a rowing machine, has proven
quite popular among students, said
Beebe. Ruscio and Beebe both dis-

cussed adding some
ches’’ to the exercise room such as
wall mirrors and benches for the
dressing rooms. Ruscio also men
tioned plans for holding classes on
how to properly use the Nautilus
machines.

Since the beginning of January, the
computer room in Gaines, which is
located on the second floor, has been
put into full use. It now houses five
computers, three of them university
main-frame computers and the other
two IBM PC’s.

Ruscio said he hopes the computer
room will receive more computers in
the future, adding that more com-
puters would be a result of increased
student use, which he expects will
happen.

Presently, the only recurring prob
lem plaguing the building is the toilets
which, according to Beebe,
stopped up from time to time.

“We're still working on the toilet
problem. We're running tests,’ said
Beebe. ‘We're trying to pinpoint
where the problem is. We've been
working very closely with the factory
and the engineers with the problem. ”’

Beebe also said that all of the closets
would be changed this summer to
meet the building's regulations. The
new closets will look identical to the
present ones, only they will consist of
different material.

Straw Poll held Wednesday

By Wendy Wolford
Staff Reporter

 

Yesterday, the College Republicans
and the Young Democrats co-spon-
sored a straw poll to determine who
the W&L community would elect
President in 1988.

Out of 336 participants, 219 voted
with the Republican party, 108 with
the Democrats. Nine voters were un-
decided.

George Bush led the Republicans
with 39.7% of the vote followed
closely by Robert Dole with 33.3%
Far behind the top two contenders,
Pete duPont captured 8.7% of the
votes, Jack Kemp, 8.2%, Alexander
Haig, 5.5%, and Pat Robertson 4.6%.

The majority of the Democratic
votes went to Mike Dukakis with
27%. Albert Gore was second with
19.4% of the vote followed by Jesse
Jackson with 15.7%, Paul Simon with
11.1% and Bruce Babbitt with 10%

Richard Gephardt and Gary Hart
each won 7.4% of the vote. Although
he was not on the ticket, Mario
Cuomo received | % of the vote

Sophomore Kristi Goodman, Presi
dent of the Young Democrats, said the
purpose of the straw poll was to de
termine who would be elected Presi
dent if the actual election took place
Tuesday on the W&L campus. She
said it is difficult to tell which audien
ces national polls reflect.

Responses from the student body re
flected a range of political views
Senior Mark Robertson, a Bush sup
porter, said, ‘‘Bush is not a strong
candidate but he’s been in the White
House and knows the ropes

Junior Betsy Parkins thinks that du
Pont’s track record as governor of De
laware makes him the best candidate

University Registrar Scott Dittman
says he supports Jack Kemp because
Kemp is the candidate he is most fa

OPINION

 

Innovate

The second annual Lip Sync contest, benefitting Multiple
Sclerosis, was held last Friday night at the GHQ and appeared to be
a rousing success, not only in the amount of money raised, but in
the number of students in attendance. It was great to see members of
the student body coming together to relax and have a good time.

It’s not often one sees this happening because of the social system
at Washington and Lee. Social life is centered around the fraternity
parties held on weekends and Wednesday nights. Not that the
fraternities are at fault for a limited social atmosphere. Being pri-
marily social organizations, they do their best to support the social
life of their members and they do a good job at that.

But this leads to a social system that is greatly dominated by
groups; a student parties with his fraternity, and other students de-
pend on those parties to have anything to do on weekends in Lexing-
ton. While there is nothing inherently wrong in fraternity parties,
their constant repetition can get boring. And what about students
not belonging to fraternities? Their social options are extremely
limited.

The Student Activities Board (SAB) seems to have three func-
tions: Fancy Dress, Wednesday nights in the GHQ, and occasional
special functions such as Christmas Weekend. With the exception
of Fancy Dress, the SAB events basically seem to be sticking a band
somewhere and letting people show up. No wonder the SAB loses
money most every year.

The success of Lip Sync has shown that W&L students are ac-
cepting to new and innovative ideas. The SAB should apply its
brainpower to coming up with new activities for the students to en-
joy. This does not mean that the SAB should start sponsoring fund-
raising events. It only means there is a need on the campus for new
social options, and the need should be addressed.

It seems to be a common complaint that fraternities party too
much, and with fraternities in the situation of being one of the most
popular targets of lawsuits, parties are becoming increasingly risky.
If the SAB would adopt some changes in its planning of events,
much of the social burden would be taken off the fraternity systems’
shoulders. This would allow brotherhoods to party with themselves
and their guests without feeling obligated to support the social lives
of W&L and five surrounding women’s colleges.

Once again we extend hearty congratulations to Jerry Darrell’s
Lip Sync contest. It’s great to see such a worthy cause supported so
well on the W&L campus.

Consider

The W&L Board of Trustees will be meeting in Lexington this
weekend, discussing the current state of the university and its plans
for the future. While the trustees are in town there are a few things
we would like them to look into. They may seem insignificant in
comparison to building a new theater or ensuring the institution’s
financial viability in today’s uneasy economic world, but they affect
the W&L community everyday, and that makes them important.

First is the parking situation at W&L, a problem that has been re-
peatedly discussed in this editorial column. We have yet to hear
from the administration about a possible solution to the problem or
a valid excuse why it has not been corrected. The trustees may think
this problem is trivial, but it’s not. The grass and ground in the Cor-
ral area at the foot of the Hill has been ruined almost completely by
cars forced to park off the pavement. Student cars overflow into the
city of Lexington, taking over spaces that we are sure merchants
would much rather have occupied by customers. It would not seem
that this situation would do much for ‘‘town-gown’’ relations.

Turning to the fraternity renaissance program, we hope that the
trustees give serious consideration to begin the program as soon as
possible. A show of strong support from the board will assure the
university community that the program is in the future, as it should
be. The renaissance program is one of the most exciting and promis-
ing developments on the fraternity front in the past few years at
W&L.

We realize that the Board of Trustees has an enormous amount of
responsibility upon it. Improving W&L’s already high standards
and ensuring its success in the future are important tasks. However,
the problems we have listed are only the beginning of a list of prob-
lems that add up to a great whole. By ignoring the small problems in
the present, the problems in the future may grow to unmanageable
proportions.

Liberals

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

My parents spent many sleepless
nights during my high school years
worrying about my future. They
feared that someone who spent so
much time in the principal’s office for
disrupting assemblies, skipping
school, organizing rotten fruit fights,
and attempting to start a revolutionary
newspaper could end up in only one
place—jail. In hopes of cooling off
some of my radical tendencies they
encouraged me to attend a conserva-
tive university. They were looking for
a school away from big cities; they
were looking for a school full of Re-
publicans; they were looking for a
school far away from home; they were
looking for Washington and Lee and
they found it.

Washington and Lee is presently
conservative but in recent weeks I
have seen the liberal seeds that are
sure to become the roots of a tropical
forest. A forest so verdant and green
that it will last eternally. I know about
this growing forest because of a vision
I will now take the pleasure of sharing
with you.

hol as the school’s favorite drug.

to the lack of interested majors, the C-
school has been converted into a Hari
Khrisna Culture Center. University
president Timothy Leary HI has is-
sued a statement concerning the de-
cision of many students to attend class
naked: ‘‘No problem man.”’

Many of you probably had this same
vision while others are wondering
what type of psychological affliction
that I suffer from. Luckily I have ta-
ken the strategy of George Orwell and
leading economists by insuring that I
will be dead at the time the prediction
can be disproved.

In order to shorten my article and
save some trees (see how liberal
things are becoming; I couldn’t have
said that a month ago) I will get to the
topic of this article—dolphins which I

will use to represent all intelligent
marine mammals.

Every day dolphins suffocate in the
nets of tuna fisherman who capitalize
on the fact that tuna swim underneath
schools of dolphins for various
reasons. Killing dolphins under any
circumstance is as immoral as killing a
human being for, amongst others, the
main reason that dolphins are superior
to humans.

Most people agree that dolphins are
morally superior because they don’t
have wars, pollution or body odor. It
is in the area of intelligence that peo-
ple have a problem accepting dolphin
superiority. The point that is most
often made is that if dolphins were as
smart as us they would have techno-

logy (by this same logic Aborigine In-
dians are also inferior to technological
societies). But let’s face it, technology
is really over-rated. In fact, technol-
ogy is stupid. Technology gave us the
Dating Game, which alone proves we
would be better off without it.

Maybe I’ve been unfair to hu-
manity—we do have a lot of good qua-
lities. The two most important ones
being reproduction and surfing. But
then again dolphins surf and rep-
roduce too. Wait a minute, we have
Captain Crunch! I guess Captain
Crunch makes up for all of our moral
and technological ills. Therefore, I am
forced to conclude that we are equal to
dolphins and until they invent Captain
Crunch they should be treated equally.

 

 

LETTERS

What happens when you chase your checks around

To: W&L Faculty Undergrads, Law Students,
and Local Merchants

It is that time of year again. We all return from
break with our checking accounts full of presents
from the festive season and new term allowances.
However, many of us are now finding out that we
lost the ‘chase the check game’’, jokingly called
by Mr. Bugg in the Phi. Not only are you finding
out that you lost the game but the local merchants,
and most importantly the Cold Check Committee,
are also finding out. This is not as amusing as you
may find it. Actually, you are paying the banks
about $15.00 per check you bounce and they love
it! This begins to hurt when the check was only
written for 50 cents to Lloyd’s for Video games
after chasing Mr. Buzz.

As chairman of the Cold Check Committee, I
am responsible for the relations between the town
merchants and the W&L community. Would
many of you frustrated check writers like to know
why you can not write checks starting May 1?
First, I will explain the Cold Check Committee to
the few who have never been summonsed or the
many who have been summonsed but did not go
because ‘“‘it is only the Cold Check Committee’.
When you write a check, the merchant sends it to
their bank in town. Their bank in town sends the
check to your bank. This takes a while for those of
you with banks located in Bohunk, West Arizona.
When you bounce a check, your bank sends the
check back to the bank of the merchant which
sends it back to the merchant. The merchant waits
a day or so and attempts to send it through a se-
cond and last time. If it bounces again the same
process ensues, this time the stamp on the check
reads ‘‘insufficient funds, remitted twice do not
remit’’ and the merchant is stuck with the bill. At
this point the merchant is supposed to call the
number on the rules sheet, which the committee
passes out at the beginning of each new year. To
my knowledge, the rules have not changed in the
past three years. When they call this number, an
exuberant and kind Mrs. Carol Ann Calkins an-
swers the phone and takes a, usually, irate mer-
chant’s name and number for a member of the
committee to go by and pick up the bad check. We
pick up the check and add it to our continuously
growing file. Then at our next meeting we send a
summons in a 22 cent envelope to your address
looked up from the register. We then hope that
you show up at the weekly 7 o'clock Thursday
night meeting.

Where does the money for the committee to
pick up these bad checks and pay postage come
from? The minuscule fines that the committee
charges the student after hearing their ‘‘my dog
ate my checkbook register’ explanations. The
fines range from a $3 fine for math error or a $5
fine for negligence, or $10 fine for a floated
check. But no one floats a check because this is
not only illegal, but could even be considered an
honor violation and none of us would ever know-
ingly do that!

If this is such a good system, why does it not
work? I'll start with the merchant’s side. Many of
the merchants hold check for weeks until they
give up trying to get hold of the student them-
selves so they can get an additional $10 to $25 dol-
lar fee for the bounced check. When they then call
me, they often have accumulated hundreds of dol-
lars in bounced checks. The committee is unable
to go to two or more merchants and collect over
$100 dollars in bad checks. The irony of this situa-
tion is the fact that W&L is the worst of all the
merchants. The University has been known to
hold checks for over 6 months! The rules passed
out to all the merchants state that once you get a
bad check you immediately call the committee and

we will immediately come and pick it up. Please
do not wait for a whole crop to return or wait until
you can’t find the students yourselves! The com-
mittee will do this. tery

In the sense of fairness, I turn to the suslent's,

side. Has anyone tried to get a law ,student to
come to a meeting on Thursday night? Yes, I real-
ize that some have classes but if you were to call
the number on your summons and set up another
time to suit you, the committee would have no
problems. But, just letting it go until you can’t
register for classes and clear your account doesn’t
cut it. I am also appalled at the attitude that some
of the students display if they even show up. The
committee is here for you! We pick up the checks
without you having to pay the fine assessed by the
merchants. This saves you anything from $10 to
$25. The committee also assures the merchants
that we will pay your tab if you bounce a check,
therefore, they always know they will get their

money so they accept your checks. So why do.

students complain about the average $5 fine from
the committee compared to the $15 or more fine
they would otherwise get from the merchants?

Why then can’t we write checks after May 1?
Because the committee stops picking checks up
after May 15 and the merchants want to get all
their bounced checks back and collected before
the committee closes its doors and the merchant is
stuck forever with your last few bills at W&L. I’-
ve talked to several merchants about their
policies. Some of them agreed to honor checks un-
til we all leave in June. However, many of us
seniors will be closing our accounts the day we
graduate and the day after many of us wrote mon-
strous checks to the Palms the night before in the
spirit of graduation. Still others will be taking out
all that is left to make the last journey of the year
home. In order for the merchants to honor the
checks that are certain to be bounced, the commit-
tee must guarantee pick up the following year.
This means huge losses to the committee from
graduates, both law and undergrads, and those
others who don’t return for other various reasons.
This means even greater losses added to the
already large group of ‘‘dead checks’’ the com-
mittee has accumulated. To suck up these added
losses, I need to ask the E.C. to budget me money
to pay for these checks. This is something that has
never been done before. The E.C. has lent the
money before, but never budgeted it with the as-
sumption that most of it will be lost. Therefore,
the money I need will have to come from other
organizations like Fancy Dress, heaven forbid, or
added to the student activity fee which is already
backbreaking. Is it worth it?

The only way to attempt to retrieve losses from
graduates and those who don’t show up to meet-
ings is to put your file in the registrar’s office on
hold. This means no transcripts: for undergrad
graduates, (the committee can’t put transcript
holds on law students because of Law School po-
licy) and no registration, grades, or diploma for
those who are still left. This is a chafe for Scott
Dittman and crew, the committee, mainly me, and
most importantly you!

I finish this editorial by asking that those who
have not written bad checks, don’t. Yes, we are
all human and will all make mista!.es, however,
this is one that can and should be avoided. I also
ask that those of you who have outstanding
checks, please come to any meeting on Thursday
nights at 7 and clear your accounts so that the
committee can clear other accounts of merchants.
Further delinquency will prove to be difficult and
expensive way to pay a $2 check. There is no real
disciplinary means the committee can take except
for Student Conduct Committee, and I don’t think

Mike Henry wants to have to slap you on your
wrist and tell you to pay your bounced check
when that is the responsibility of Cold Check! If

. the committee is not respected by students or mer-

chants then why have it? Try writing checks then!
Ask the Seniors from Mary Baldwin what hap-
pened when their Cold Check Committee ceased
to exist freshman year.

Lastly, to all you Seniors who will bounce
checks near graduation, enjoy, because those stu-
dents that are left behind will be picking up your
tab. And to you who are left, I am glad that next
year’s Chairman of the Committee will be chasing
you, and not me.

Lip Sync is success

To the Editors:

The 2nd annual Lip Sync contest to benefit Mul-
tiple Sclerosis was, once again, a smashing suc-
cess. On Friday evening approximately 250 spec-
tators had a ball jamming to the tunes of ‘‘the
Village People’’, ‘‘Tom Bon Jovi & the Skulls’,
the ‘‘Modern Major General’’, ‘‘George Mi-
chael’’ and nine other ingenious acts. Close to
$900.00 was raised for MS, doubling last year’s
proceeds. Thanks go out to the following mer-
chants who generously donated door prizes which
were given out to spectators throughout the even-
ing: Lloyd’s of Lexington, Wendy’s, The Palms,
Willson-Waiker House, J&B Office Supply, Sy-
camore Farms, Flip Side, Golden Corral, S&S
Auto Repair, Long John Silver’s, Subway Sand-
wich Shop, Spanky’s, W&L GHQ Tavern, W&L
Bookstore, W&L Executive Committee, and
W&L Student Activities Board.

Finally, 1 want to extend my heartfelt gratitude
to the many volunteers who worked behind the
scene (and the stage) and enabled the show to
come off without a hitch. The list is too numerous
to print here but you know who you are and on
behalf of the National Multiple Sclerosis So-
ciety—give yourselves a big hug.

Very sincerely,
Jerry Darrell

Lesson to be learned

To the Editors:

One has to wonder if it’s worth the effort.
Washington and Lee just finishes it’s drug aware-
ness week, and there is now a poster for party at
Zollman’s pavilion. What’s wrong with this? The
poster has two outstretched arms holding beer
mugs while driving. Aren’t we suppose to be past
this point by now? It’s ironic that while the frater-
nities have received a lot of heat from this prob-
lem, now a woman’s group is glamorizing drink-
ing and driving. We’ve all read articles written by
someone who has lost a friend due to drunk driv-
ing, and such articles usually contain the line,
‘*When will we ever learn?’’ I guess we haven’t
yet.

Last all-male class remembers ‘how it was’

International chapter

By Margaret Pimblett
Staff Reporter

 

About 45 W&L undergraduate stu-
dents and professors attended an or-
ganizational meeting for a campus
chapter of Amnesty International, a
human rights organization which
works to free what it calls “‘prisoners
of conscience.’

The meeting was scheduled by Ke-
vin McNamara, a W&L senior, who
said he was interested in ‘‘getting the
ball rolling’’ for the group.

According to its promotional litera-
ture, Amnesty International is a hu-
man rights organization with three
goals: the release of prisoners of
conscience—people who have been
imprisoned for their belief who have
not used or advocated violence, *‘fair
and prompt trials for all political
prisoners’’ and ‘‘an end to torture and
executions in all cases.””

The Amnesty organization includes

term, featuring the band Indecision.

The party will offer a chance ‘‘to
see people you haven't seen since
freshman year’’ in a setting where
‘everyone mutually belongs,’” said
Henry, deeming it ‘‘a good chance to
catch up.”’

It is not the case that the party Is
closed to W&L co-eds, said Henry.
The party is closed to all W&L under-
classmen, excepting the dates of W&L
seniors.

The four women’s colleges were in-

how it was and we know how it was,”
stated Henry.

Each college is contributing money
from its social fund. This money is
paying for a large part of the band.
This enables the seniors to have a se-
cond party, also with a band, in the
spring.

He believes that the largest negative
aspect concerning coeducation is the
loss of the ‘intangible bond”’ posses-
sed throughout the dormitories before
the beginning of coeducation.

Before, the only times that women

coeducation ‘‘doesn’t give all of the
guys the amount of time they had be-
fore to spend with each other.”

Henry said the party will have am-
ple free drinks, including twenty kegs
and alternate beverages. There will be
eight sober drivers available.

The party is free to all seniors who
have paid their dues. There will be a
computerized list at the door of who
has and has not paid their dues. If you
have not paid your dues, please bring
$10 with you to cover this party and
the party in the spring.

> To the Editors:

Recently the Executive Committee accepted ap-
* plications for the White Book Revisions Commit-
,tee. Sure it’s great resurné fodder, but also it is
wonderful opportunity to effect great changes in
“the ways we enforce our honor system. For those
lucky enough to be nominated to this important
committee, I offer two suggestions you might
*want to discuss.
. First, confidentiality, under Section O, is a
wonderful concept, but the Executive Committee
*has no power to enforce it. The goal of confiden-
ytiality is to protect the rights of the accused, and
our elected representatives need the force to
*protect those rights. While the accused may be
«guilty or innocent, that is not a matter for 1500 in-
dependent juries to decide. We have a process, a
“damn good proces, that litigates on our behalf.
+Let’s put some muscle behind confidentiality to
curb the ‘‘gossip factor’’ in our honor proceed-
*ings.
« Second, and along the lines of the first sugges-
tion, why not close the doors on student body
“honor trials? Keep the jury. Keep the court offi-
«cers. Keep the prosecution. Keep the defense.
, They all serve a function, but the audience is not
“really necessary. Think about it. I know every-
~body wants a ‘‘foundation for public discussion on
,issues of honor’, but after the trial there are no is-
" sues—the jury has already rendered the verdict.
«Further, there are no “‘ongoing issues’’ because
,the enforcement of our honor system is admin-
istered on a case-by-case basis. There is no prece-
*dent. The honor trial is an appeal which, by nature
of its presence, exalts the possibility of innocence

That innocence should be protected.

“*But, Mike,”’ you say, **I want the opportunity
to see the honor system at work.’’ Oh, but you do
see the honor system at work everyday. As long

-aS we can still leave our doors unlocked, také un-

proctored exams, believe the words of our class-
mates, respeét One another, and be truthful to our-
selves, the honor system is at work, and you can
see it—you can feel it. The honor system is not the
thirteen members of the Executive Committee,
day long trials, and pledged exams. These are
only conventions we have established to enforce
and protect our system. The honor system, hope-
fully, is within you. Look no further.

Sure, my suggestions might knock out some
great conversation topics, and will make winter
term rather dull, but the goal of these measures is
to protect individuals, some of whom are not un-
like yourself. If nothing else. it will save on the
cost of repainting the library elevator doors. The
defense rests.

Sincerely,
Michael D. Webb

Disdain for ‘Hanoi Jane’

To the Editors:

It was with much disdain that I read the recent
editorial challenge Pat Heffernan made January

— LETTERS

; Senior suggests changes for White Book

2 Ist, urging Phi staffer, Margaret Pimblett, to be-
come the next ‘‘Hanoi Jane’’ of Washington and
Lee. I would tend to doubt that Miss Pimblett
would lend herself to any of the radicalism that
Heffernan suggested. Can he really believe that
the erection of a ‘‘shanty town’”’ in front of the Co-
lonnade would actually inspire P.W. Botha to
publicly embrace Nelson Mandella in downtown
Johannesburg or move our moral, loving Soviet
adversaries to promptly withdraw from Afghanis-
tan? If he does, would you ask him to tell Santa I
want a fire engine for Christmas and a low-cal
bunny from the Easter Rabbit?!

While I respect Mr. Heffenan’s desire to see an
end to the vulgarity of human rights violations
in the world, I fail to see how, in any real terms,
the placement of corrugated tin shacks in front of
the Colonnade (a national historic landmark),
would help the plight of black South Africans, the
Solidarity movement, or the Contras. His propo-
sal would be the vile equivalent of putting missile
silos in Yellowstone Park. It is, undoubtedly, his
naif and ridiculously idealistic views that charac-
terize him as an unsophisticated, glassy eyed
Freshman dwelling somewhere just east of Uto-
pia. I, for one, do not wish to compromise the
elegant beauty of our campus. While all of the
causes Heffernan mentions merit support, he and
anyone else would be doing them little service by
playing the role of incompetent sheet metal
workers.

Yours in the preservation of
good taste,

McNamara said he heard of Am-

the campus chapter there.

He said he wanted to form the chap-

The purpose of the W&L chapter,

McNamara stressed that he was not

students to begin their work for social

Anece McCloud, associate dean of
students for minority and international
affairs, was selected this month to the
fifth edition of Who's Who Among
Black Americans.

McCloud has been at W&L since
1985, initially serving as an advisor to
both minority and international stu-
dents. Since 1985 however, her work
in the Dean’s office has expanded.
She now advises pre-med students,
helps students that are going abroad to
study to get visa’s and applications,
and has established study skills pro-

grams for students.

**To be effective I want to be able to
provide service to all kinds of stu-
dents. With the support of Dean John
I’ve been able to develop some new
types of programs like the study skills
program,’ McCloud said.

McCloud was included in Who's
Who Among Black Americans mainly
for her work before she came to
W&L. Publishers of the book look for
“reference value. ”’

‘They [the publishers] contacted
me about biograhical information and
asked me if I would be willing to serve
on boards, etc.,’” McCloud said.

Individuals are selected to be in the
book based on appointments to office
or achievement in a career. Previously

she taught in Greensboro, North Caro-
lina and at Woodbridge Air Force
Base in England. She has also served
as assistant registrar for academic re-
cords and the first director of the of-
fice of minority student affairs at the
University of Nebraska Medical
Center.

Currently McCloud is a member of
the American Association for Coun-
seling and Development, the Associa-
tion of American Medical Colleges,
and is a member of the board of direc-
tors of the Rockbridge Unit of the
American Cancer Society and the
National Association for Women
Deans.

McCloud says her selection comes
at a time when many women and min-

 

McCloud receives Who’s Who honors

orities are wondering if it is truly pos-
sible to be achievers in a male-
dominated world.

“I’ve lived through a time where it
was difficult for women and minori-
ties to get a good education. Now I
think things are changing. The oppor-
tunities are there,’’ McCloud said.

‘*With affirmative action and other
legal hiring practices there has been
some head-way gained, but I would
really hope that beyond these legal
means employers would want to hire
based on ability,’ McCloud said.

McCloud will be finishing her own
education in the next few months
when she completes her Masters De-
gree in sociology from the University
of Nebraska at Omaha.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Anece F. McCloud :

Prisoner of the Vietnam war recounts his six-year imprisonment

 

By Stephanie Guittard
Staff Reporter

The most decorated man in the his-
tory of the Air Force spoke here on
Tuesday on the power of values to
carry people through times of crisis.

Col. John A. Dramesi USAF (Ret.)
began his military career in 1956. His
initial assignment was in 1966 in
southeast Asia, serving with the 4th
Infantry Division as an Air Liaison
Officer and Division Forward Air
Controller.

On April 2, 1967, Dramesi was shot
down and captured by the North Viet-
namese. His first escape was eight
days later, yet he was recaptured on
April 11. He led his second escape on
May 10, 1969, which was the only or-
ganized POW escape of the war from
Hanoi. Once again, he was captured
one day later.

Dramesi kept himself alive during
his imprisonment by the strength of
his personal motivations.

“It is your schooling, it is your
friends, it is your mom and dad, it is
the way you were brought up. All of
those things make up the individual.
You're either prepared for the outside
world or a crisis or you’re not pre-
pared properly,’” he stated.

‘A true hero is one who, having
failed, will attempt to uphold the
values he holds dear; he will try again.
Show me one who has failed, failed,
failed, and I'll accept that man or
woman who as tried, tried, tried.’’

He was tortured severely after the
escape attempts, witnessed the deaths

of comrades, yet kept the spirit to live
strong. On March 3, 1973, he was
released, after six years of captivity in
North Vietnam.

‘*There was so much controversy
about the Vietnam War, they
thought...when we finally got back
we'd accept the negativism that was
part of the Vietnam Era. It certainly
wasn’t the case with myself, I was
happy to be back and interested in get-
ting started,’’ Dramesi said.

*‘[For] the POWs specifically, there
was a tremendous swell of enthusiasm
as a result of their coming home
throughout the country. I guess people
look to that as being the homecoming
or the celebration of the end of the
war. Individually...people were
strung out...and I can understand their
negative attitude toward their home-
coming and the Vietnam War, but cer-
tainly I don’t see how the POWs
should have any negative attitudes ex-
cept that they might say, ‘Well, why
didn’t you do what you did three or
four years ago, as opposed to allowing
us to be there longer than any other
prisoners in the history of the United
States.’”’

Dramesi currently serves as Special
Project Officer to Maj. Gen. Francis
R. Gerard, Adjutant General, New
Jersey Department of Defense. He
helps provide service to veterans who
need assistance. He acknowledges the
veterans who have suffered psycholo-
gically from their experience, but ex-

plains that they do not represent the
Vietnam veterans as a whole.

Lip Sync contest

raises over

By Melinda Conkling
Staff Reporter

 

There was standing room only, and
not much of that, last Friday night in
the GHQ as the Second Annual Lip
Syne Contest took place. Approxi-
mately 250 spectators gathered to
watch 12 acts which included Ma-
donna, Run DMC, and Spinal Tap.
The contestants were comprised of
W&L students, as well as Lexington
townspeople.

This year’s $100 grand prize was
awarded to five members of the Fiji
house for their rendition of the Village
People’s ‘“YMCA.”’

“We had a lot of fun and helped
benefit Multiple Sclerosis at the same
time,’’ said Phil DuPont, one of the
winning band members. ‘‘We picked
“YMCA’ because it was funny and we
thought we could make it pretty inter-
esting.”

$800

The $50 second prize went to five
W&L coeds who performed another
Village People hit, “‘Macho Man.”’
The Lexington Chamber Music Socie-
ty’s ‘‘Do Re Mi’”’ earned Fancy Dress
tickets and third place honors. Honor-
able mentions were awarded to Bon
Jovi’s ‘“‘You Give Love A Bad
Name”’ and Aretha & Co.'s ‘‘Re-
spect.’’

Many people benefitted from the
fund-raising exhibition that raised
over $850. Door prizes were awarded
to several spectators. The prizes in-
cluded gift certificates from the Will-
son-Walker House, an oil and lube job
from S&S Auto Repair and sandwi-
ches from Wendy’s, Lloyd’s of Lex-
ington, and the Golden Corral.

‘*I’m overjoyed by the response to
the contest. It was only our second
year, but everyone had a great time,”’
said Jerry Darrell, regional MS vol-
unteer and director of University Food
Services.

problems, and rightly so. Let’s not be
fooled, let’s not develop the wrong
perception. ..My information indicates
that he represents a better cut than that
which would be viewed as the average
[/american citizen]}.””

“If you go out, right in this area,
the faculty, people in business, the
town government or whatever, find
out who the Vietnam veterans are.

You'll be surprised in that they are in
positions of responsibility.””

‘*There is an attempt to help, but,
there are 900,000 veterans in New
Jersey, and 213,000 of those are Viet-
nam veterans. The point is, out of
those 213,000...there is very very
very small segment of people who at
this point, for one reason or another,
are incapable of helping themselves in
the environment that exists to benefit

them...That does not represent the
whole of the Vietnam veterans.’’

“But yes, there are those who don’t
have jobs, there are those who are al-
coholics, and there are those who are
influenced by drugs, and there are
those who need help, but, certainly
they do not represent the...Vietnam
veterans. I am positive that that is the
case nationwide.”’

Dramesi is the author of the book

Code of Honor, and is the most highly
decorated man in the United”
States Air Force. He holds the Master,
Jump Wings, the Army’s highest par-
achute rating, two Air Force Cross?
awards for valor, the Silver Star, five,
Purple Hearts, and numerous other
awards. ‘

Dramesi’s visit was sponsored by,
the W&L Military Science Depart-

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee University
Concert Guild will present pianist
Leon Bates Tuesday, Feb. 2, at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel on the W&L campus. A
reception for Bates at the W&L
Alumni House will follow the perfor-
mance.

The concert is open to all W&L
Concert Guild season ticket holders
and W&L personnel. Tickets may also
be purchased at the door at $5 for
adults and $3 for senior citizens and
non-W&L students.

Bates will perform ‘‘Toccata’’ by
Perkinson, ‘‘Sonatine’’ by Ravel, and
‘Five Miniatures for Piano’’ and
‘Variations for Piano’’ by Robert
Stewart, chairman of the music div-
ision at Washington and Lee.

Also included in the program will
be ‘‘Fourth Autumn”’ by Ellis Marsa-
lis, ‘‘Five Children’s Songs’’ by
Chick Corea, and ‘‘Sonata No. 1”’
(1953) by George Walker.

Bates has established himself as one
of the leading performers in America.
A favorite among Lexington audien-
ces, Bates returns to W&L after ap-

pearances in Carnegie Hall, Alice Tu-
lly Hall, the Kennedy Center, and the
Academy of Music in Philadelphia,
among others.

Bates has performed with major
symphonies, among them the New
York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia
and Cleveland Orchestras, the
National Symphony, the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, and the San Francisco
and Detroit Symphonies. He has also
performed with symphonies in Du-
blin, Zimbabwe, Strasbourg, Vienna,
Canada, and Rome.

In 1987, Bates returned to Europe to

Relache gives W&L contemporary

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

Many of those who arrived at the
Ralache concert in Lee Chapel Tues-
day, Jan. 19, were probably not quite
sure what to expect.

Although the term ‘‘contemporary
music’’ is familiar enough, just what
type of music this term refers to might
not be so obvious to those who are not
musically oriented. The Washington
and Lee Concert Guild provided the
opportunity to find out just what ‘‘con-
temporary music’’ is when they
brought Relache to campus.

Relache (full name, ‘‘Relache: the
Ensemble for Contemporary Music)
has expanded remarkably since it was
founded by Joseph Showalter and
Joseph Franklin in Philadelphia ten
years ago. As a performing ensemble,
its many talented artists have built a
widely varied repertoire through work
with composers at places such as Yel-
low Springs Institute and Drexel Uni-
versity.

Developing their ‘‘world music”’
image in the combination of Ameri-
can, European, and Asian composi-
tions, Relache’s own unique sound
began to emerge through their unusual

instrumentation and
techniques.

improvisation

Relache is also a producing organi-
zation that emphasizes the music of
living composers. Their insight into
the composition of music and practice
of direct collaboration with composers
and performers is widely recognized.

The best way to get a taste of to-
day’s contemporary or ‘‘new’’ music
would be to hear Relache perform in
concert or on one of their radio pro-
grams. To describe this music in
words in difficult, even for the
group’s executive director, Joseph
Franklin. When asked for his own de-

Executive Committee forms committee
on Lexington City Council housing issue

By John Ryan
Staff Reporter

The Executive Committee Monday
formed a committee to represent stu-
dents in the ongoing Lexington City
Council debate over a law that forbids
more than four unrelated people from
living in the same house.

The EC also heard the Independent
Union report from IU president John
Maxwell, and a budget request from
John Legters, incoming Rugby Club
president.

The new committee, headed by EC
member Brandt Wood, will represent
student’s interests in the debate about
the enforcement of the law, which
could drastically affect off-campus
housing. EC members on the commit-

tee are John McDonough, Pat
Schaefer, Christopher de Movellan,
and Powell Starks. Students are in-
vited to join. Interested students can
call Brandt Wood at 463- 9800.

IU president John Maxwell reported
on October, November, and Decem-
ber expenditures for the organization,
He said that approximately 250 people
have participated in intramural sports
for the TU, which finished fourth
overall for fall term, its best finish
ever. Maxwell said ‘‘quite a few”
freshman had expressed interest in the
Independent Union.

week, and the organization needs

She told how a particular mother
saw her son's drug paraphernalia
every day and didn’t realize what it
was.

She said education will teach what
drugs do to one’s body. Then, with all
the information, people can decide if
drugs are worth it.

Bias de-emphasized the role of
television and other influences which
have sometimes glamorized drugs and
alcohol.

“You have to make your own
choices, that cigarettes and alcohol
will not stop being sold,’’ said Bias.

She said she believes these shows
can sometimes be helpful because they

ae

often present real-life issues.

With more education will come
more awareness, Said Bias. It’s only
unfortunate that sometimes awareness
comes after a tragedy. The theory that
it can’t happen to me can prove to be
wrong and that is why going to these
seminars can be beneficial.

She said ‘‘Issues affect all of us,
even if we don’t have these prob-
lems.’

She also thinks the alcohol and drug
laws need to be strengthened, alth-
ough this will not make any difference
in the choices to be made. ‘We will
be held accountable ourselves.’’ Mrs.
Bias said she is in favor of government
drug programs, especially the Just Say
No program. ‘‘My hat is off to the
first lady’’, she replied. She said that
people are being influenced by this
program.

Law students hold buffet in Lee’s honor

By Marie Dunne
Co-Editor

Besides the Founder’s Day/ODK
Convocation, Lee’s birthday now has
another celebratory meeting: The Lee-
Jackson Dinner.

Last year W&L law students Mark-
ham Pyle and John Williamson held a
private dinner at the Alumni House
honoring Lee. This year, the dinner,
which attracted over 50 guests, was
held at the GHQ Tavern in the Uni-
versity Center.

The purpose of the dinner, de-
scribed by Williamson as a ‘‘gentle-
man’s buffet,’’ was to honor Lee and
his ideology of *‘heal the wounds.”’

support of rock musicians ‘‘brought
Amnesty to my attention, but was not
a motivating factor. The motivating
factor was my belief that I could do
something’’ to improve human rights.

Several of the students who attended
Tuesday’s meeting were members of
Amnesty at other colleges before
transferring to W&L, McNamara
said, adding that ‘‘anybody who has
past experience’’-or the intention of
helping is welcome to join the group.

Both McNamara and Brown said
they were surprised by the turnout for
the organizational meeting, but were
very excited about the prospects for
the group.

Future plans for the W&L chapter
include sponsoring speakers and films
about the work of Amnesty Interna-
tional. Brown said such programs
would be open to the public.

“It’s not just freeing people from
torture, it’s also educating people to
get over their indifference’ to the

Got the winter blues?

Is school really starting to get on
your nerves?

Trident, W&L’s women’s organiza-
tion, is sponsonng a party at Zoll-
man’s Pavilion Saturday with the Ec-
centrics from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.

‘It is the first school-wide event
this term and judging from the past
events, I think it will be a great suc-
cess,’’ said Alston Parker, president
of the organization.

Party-goers must purchase a ticket
prior to the party in order to come.
Guests are invited by invitation only.

Tickets are $8 a couple and $5 for
singles. T-shirts are two for $18 and
one T-shirt for $10.

J. William McClintock will be sworn in as a trustee during the
Board’s meeting this week.

Trident makes arrangements for Winter slosh

Parker stressed that alcoholic
beverages will not be served at the
party.

‘‘We do not want people confused.
Trident is not supplying alcohol or
mixers.’’ Cokes and food will be pro-
vided, she said.

Parker is very concerned about the
drinking situation at the pavilion be-
cause of the dangerous road leading to
the site.

‘I want to stress the fact that since
the party is being held at Zollman’s,
and people will probably drink be-
forehand, it is difficult to drive on that
road sober and probably more dang-

 

erous to drive after drinking,’’ she
said.

In the event that party-goers seem to
have too much to drink, Parker hopes
that others will take notice and pick a
sober driver. She said some people
have already stated that a designated
driver will be chosen.

There will be a security guard at the
gate to check the guest list, she said,
stressing the point that a ticket is
necessary to get into the party. All
women at the university (exchange
students and transfers included) are
invited and can bring date or guest.

the guest list, which included under-
graduate and law students, alumni
from both W&L and VMI, and some
townspeople.

Guests, who came from every re-
gion of the United States, were selec-
ted for their interest in the South, said
Williamson. Several minority students
attended the black-tie dinner, but no
women were invited, according to
Williamson,

“*It’s not so much a conscious effort
to exclude women,”’ said Williamson,

Beebe said he was pleased that
Buildings and Grounds had not gotten
any complaints about heating prob-
lems during these cold winter
months—a sign that there is no prob-
lem, according to Beebe.

Beebe stressed that Gaines Hall re-
sidents should contact B&G if any
heating problems occur rather than
suffer through the next few months in
the cold or invest in a space heater.

Ruscio said that everything ap-
peared to be going according to sche-
dule now for finishing the final tou-
ches on the gatehouse.

Presently, the Residence Life office
has begun receiving applications for
next year. Ruscio said there are
already more applications than avail-
able spaces. However, that number
should drop slightly as students’ plans
become more concrete for next year.

Gaines Residence Hall, which has
been under construction since 1986, is
named after Francis Pendleton
Gaines, a former president of W&L.

_ eording-to Hotchkiss, the dinner is not

a formal meeting and has no agenda,
but it is intended to give the two
boards a chance to meet socially.

The Board meets with both students
and faculty during its meetings on
campus.

“*At each meeting, the Board meets
with a section of the Washington and
Lee faculty,’’ said Hotchkiss, ‘‘This
board meeting will involve meeting
with all the Law School faculty.’

Twenty-four students, ‘‘generally
student leaders,’’ have been invited to
have lunch with the Board on Friday,
said Hotchkiss. Additionally, the
President of the Student Body attends
all of the Board’s meetings to express
students’ concerns, said Hotchkiss.

The Board will attend the speech by
Tom Wolfe tonight as a group. Wolfe,

speech at 8:30 pm in Evans Dining

ner’s purposes is to allow men a
chance to dine together in the spirit of
camaraderie of a formal military din-
ner, said Williamson.

“It had nothing to do with any ide-
ology or chauvinism,’ said Pyle.

The function was a private dinner,
funded by the guests at $10 a head,
said Pyle. The committee rented both
the Alumni house and the GHQ
Tavern. The hosts cooked most of the
meal consisting of traditional South-
ern dishes and hired the GHQ staff to
help serve the dinner, said Pyle.

Hopkins is
‘best meet’
for women

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

 

The women’s swim team continued
its streak of outstanding personal per-
formances in last Friday's meet
against Johns Hopkins.

The team lived up to head coach
Page Remillard’s prediction that, after
proving its competence at the George-
town meet, W&L would again com-
pete well against similarly ranked
Hopkins. The final score was 98-78
for Hopkins—a considerable im-
provement over the Georgetown re-
sults.

Junior Nancy Whalen and freshman
Sharon Coleman managed to surpass
Remillard’s expectations. In the
100-yd. freestyle, Whalen swam a
personal best.

‘This is an amazing accomplish-
ment,”’ said Remillard, ‘‘since per-
sonal bests usually occur at the very
end of a season.”’

Coleman produced an equally im-
pressive achievement by breaking the
school record in the 200-yd. butterfly.

Remillard also commended the
efforts of sophomores Heather Logan
and Kris Amoroso.

Logan swam excellent races in the
100-yd. and 200-yd. breaststroke and
medley relay events and Amoroso also
performed strongly for W&L in the
100-yd. backstroke, the medley relay,
and the 200-yd. freestyle.

Remillard says it is evident that
Logan improves at every meet and he
has noted the progress of freshman
Rachelle Nock as well, who follows
Logan’s pattern. If Logan cuts off
three seconds, then so does Nock. In
fact, the entire team has been improv-
ing gradually.

All in all, Remillard believes Hop-
kins to have been ‘‘by far the best
meet for the women.”’

The team refuses to be beaten ba-
dly. However strong the opponent has
been, W&L has consistently given
them a tough, competitive race.

‘*The women always seem to disre-
gard the odds,’’ said Remillard.

The team’s record is now 2-3 and
considering the swimmers’ steady im-
provement, next Friday’s meet at
Shepherd could be W&L’s third vic-

tory.

If there’s ever been a sure thing,
this is it: the 1988 Washington and
Lee track team will have a winning
season. The Generals have finished
above .500 for each of the past 11
years, and 1988 shouldn’t be any
different.

Coming off conference cham-
pionships in indoor and outdoor
track in 1987, the Generals will
begin their new season this Satur-
day at the Virginia Tech Relays.

““We graduated some great ath-
letes last year,’’ said head coach
Norris Aldridge, ‘‘but we also have
some outstanding athletes back.”’

The return of senior Andrew
White should make the Generals
tough to beat in the hurdle events.
One of the team’s captains, White
holds the school record in the 110
and 400-meter hurdles. White was
named the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Runner-of-the-Year in
indoor and outdoor track in 1987.

The Generals should also be
strong in the sprints. Sophomore
Wes Boyd is back after winning the
100 and 200-meter races at the
conference championship meet as a

Hoopsters hold off Sydney Tigers,
knock off 4th-ranked team in nation

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Consider the fact that its leading
scorer fouled out with only nine
points. Consider the fact it made 19
turnovers. Consider the fact it blew a
17-point second-half lead. Consider
all this and you can see why it is diffi-
cult to believe the W&L basketball
team beat the Hampden-Sydney
Tigers 91-87 on the road Tuesday
night.

The win placed the General’s record
at a sparkling 14-3, 6-3 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference, and
ended a week in which W&L went
2-1, including a big win over the con-
ference-leading Bridgewater College
Eagles last Thursday and a frustrating
loss to Maryville on Sunday after-
noon.

Against Hampden-Sydney, senior
guard Steve Hancock, the team’s lead-
ing scorer, was saddled with foul
trouble throughout most of the game
and the Generals had to look to other
sources for point production. They got

freshman. Other returning sprin-
ters include senior John White and
sophomores Lee Fleming and Ri-
chard Tompkins.

The distance events should be
another strength for W&L. Senior
Richard Moore, conference cham-
pion in the 1500-meters last year,
returns along with senior Scott
Rippeon and junior Jamie Urso.

Sophomore Phil Sampson is
back after setting the school record
in the pole vault (14-6) in his first
collegiate meet, and seniors Joe Fi-
sher and Rob Williamson will also
compete in that event. Junior Fray
McCormick returns to defend his
ODAC title in the high jump.

The Generals seem most likely
to have problems in the throwing
events and in the long and triple
jumps. Tom Murray set the school
record in the shot put before he
graduated last May. The Generals
will look to junior Jim Ambrosini
to score points in the shot, discus
and javelin.

Senior Norm Sigler is experi-
enced in the long and triple jumps,
but the Generals will need more
scorers in those events. Despite
these weaknesses, Aldridge seems
optimistic. ‘‘If we stay away from
injuries, we should be successful
again.””

it from junior guard Emmanuel
Klump, who scored a season-high 17
points on 7-9 shooting from the floor,
and freshman guard Mike Holton,
who matched Klump’s point total of
17, including four clutch free throws
in the last minute of play.

The game was marred with turn-
overs, with W&L committing 19 mis-
cues for the game. The Tigers didn’t
take good care of the basketball, mak-
ing 16 of their own with 14 of them
coming in the first half. On the
strength of those turnovers and the in-
side play of senior center Harmon
Harden—12 of his 15 points in the
first half—the Generals raced out front
to a 47-38 lead at halftime.

The lead would grow to as much as
17, with W&L holding onto a 57-40
advantage after freshman guard Jim
Casey nailed a three-point shot with
17:47 left to play. The Tigers,

however, would not fold as they
scored 10 straight points in the next
two minutes to get back in the ball-
game. H&S was hampered with the
loss of its starting center Orson Wil-
liams in the first half to a knee injury.

 

In a most bizarre turn of events, Wil-
liams injured his right knee when he
stood up at the scorer’s table to come
into the game.

With the loss of Williams, the
Tigers relied heavily on their leading
scorer, Ralph Baker. Baker would
score a game-high 30 points and
almost singlehandedly defeat W&L.
Scoring 11 of his team’s final 15
points, Baker was unstoppable down
the stretch. After hitting a long three-
pointer with 22 seconds left, W&L
found itself with only a two-point lead
at 87-85. But then Holton stepped up
to the line and ended all Tiger hopes
of pulling off a remarkable comeback.

The Generals began the week
knocking off Bridgewater 71-67 at
Bridgewater. The Eagles came into
the game as the 4th-ranked Division
III team in the nation, but W&L han-
dled them with ease.

Hammering the ball inside to Har-
den (15 points) and freshmen for-
wards Ed Hart (12 points) and Chris
Jacobs (10 points), W&L grabbed a

Strategy

helps

W&L beat JHU

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

A little strategic maneuvering may
have helped the W&L men’s swim-
ming team in last Friday’s 97-86 win
over Johns Hopkins at Cy Twombly
Pool.

*‘When Hopkins came down, our
game plan was that there was a possi-
bility they could beat us—looking and
comparing lineups,’’ said head coach
Page Remillard. ‘‘So we wanted to try
a few things. One thing was keeping
[sophomore]David Olson out of a
couple of meets.”

Two weeks ago, Remillard had Ol-
son and sophomore Adam Morgan sit
out the Shippensburg meet because he
felt their efforts weren’t going to
make a difference in the outcome
(W&L lost) and because it allowed a
couple of the other swimmers on the

ee —

a,

 

team the opportunity to compete
against a top-notch program. But there
was another motive behind the move.

‘Not swimming them in the meet
meant that Johns Hopkins would look
at the meet results for Shippensburg
and not see Olson or Morgan since
November,’’ said Remillard. ‘‘If we
felt that [Hopkins was] not sure that
Olson and Morgan were going to
swim, then we could predict what
their lineup was going to be. We end-
ed up being somewhat successful and
that made a big difference.”

Olson didn’t let his coach or team-
mates down, as he smoked the
200-yard backstroke in 1:57.81, qual-
ifying him for the NCAA Division III
championship in the event. Based on
last week’s national times, Olson’s
performance is the fastest in the coun-
try this year. Olson also qualified for

Wrestling takes second -
in W&L Invitational

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

The W&L wrestling team lost yes-
terday to Virginia Tech 27-14. After
the first four weight classes, the Gen-
erals had a 12-5 lead but Tech later
tied the score at 14-14 and won the
final three matches to secure the vic-
tory.

The Generals made a fine showing
this past weekend, grabbing 2nd place
in the eight-team W&L Invitational
held in the Warner Center.

Longwood proved too tough for the

rest of the field, winning the tourna- -

ment with a score of 79.5 points.
W&L followed with 51.5 points, with
Newport News Apprentice (46), Da-
vidson (40.75), Gettysburg (38.5),
Gardner-Webb (34), Johns Hopkins
(27.25) and Furman (15) rounding out
the remainder of the scoring.

“It was just hard to evaluate the
teams we were wrestling against in
this particular tournament because we
hadn’t seen them before,’ said head
coach Gary Franke. ‘*You just don’t
know their depth and how many good
wrestlers they had brought in their
freshman class. I felt Longwood was

probably the team to beat.”’

The Generals ;vere without the ser-
vices of senior Kevin McNamara,
who was out of action with the
chicken pox. Franke thought McNa-
mara, who wrestles at 158 or 167 Ibs,
would have possibly made the finals
and that his points would have made
the meet closer.

W&L did have one wrestler win his
weight class and also had several oth-
ers place in the top four. Senior Steve
Castle won the 118 lb. championship,
beating freshman teammate Larry Pil-
key with a technical fall. Pilkey was
wrestling as part of W&L’s ‘‘B’’
team. The other place-winners for the
Generals were senior John Lowe, 3rd
at 134; sophomore Lee Garlove, 3rd
at 142; freshman Mark Monahan, 4th
at 150; junior Mark Robertson, 2nd at
167; and Monoli (George) Loupassi,
3rd at 190.

“I think we got some nice perfor-
mances from Monahan in there at
150,”’ said Franke. ‘‘The kids who
placed are what’s important.”’

The team will be traveling to Long-
wood for a dual-meet invitational this
Saturday. W&L will be joined by
Longwood, Pembroke State, Norfolk
State, Newport News Apprentice,

Ferrum and Virginia State in the sev-
en-team meet.

six-point lead early in the second half
and then never looked back. The Gen-
erals contained the ODAC’s second
leading scorer, Ramsey Yeatts, who
scored a tough 25 points on 10-21
shooting. Again, the Generals were
cool at the line—especially in the clos-
ing moments—hitting 14-18 free
throws in the second half.

W&L was not so cool on Sunday
afternoon against Maryville College,
losing 91-78. The Scots, arguably the
most athletic team in the conference,
shot the lights out on the Warner
Center floor, making 54 percent of
their field goal attempts, including 41
percent from three-point range.

Maryville was led by a balanced at-
tack with five players scoring in
double figures. Hancock led all
scorers with 21 points, as the Generals
dug themselves into a hole of 10
points or more three times during the
game and were unable to cut into the
deficit. Hancock’s three-pointer made
ita 81-78 game with 54 seconds show-
ing on the clock, but the Generals
would not score again and the Scots
were able to leave with a 13-point vic-
tory.

Remillard also mentioned the effort
of senior Simon Perez, who he said is

‘Greek’ typifies prejudice

(Part two of two)

It is somewhat ironic that two days after the ill-fated
and ignorant remarks made by Jimmy ‘‘The Greek”
Snyder that a black quarterback, Doug Williams, should
help his team win the NFC Championship game over the
Minnesota Vikings and earn a trip to the SuperBowl. I
say ironic because Snyder made many comments that ac-
curately reflect the established stereotypical views of
black athletes and coaches, and Williams is proof posi-
tive that these views are dead wrong.

Snyder is one of the many members in the Al Cam-
panis Fan Club. These unfortunate souls for some reason
think that black people, although having the physical tal-
ents, lack the ‘necessities’ *(read: brains) to play the so-
called intellectual positions of quarterback in football or
to be able coach, manage or run a professional organiza-
tion as an executive officer.

How can anyone make such a generalization, especial-
ly when there are so many examples out there that totally
refute this assessment. Example 1: The head coach who
has won more football games than any other person on
this planet is black. Eddie Robinson of Grambling has
stood the true test of time and now he stands alone as the
winningest coach ever. Example(s) 2: Doug Williams,
Don McPherson, Randall Cunningham, Warren Moon.
All of these guys are quarterbacks—the intelligent posi-
tion in football—and all of them are black. But most im-
portant, all of them are successful. And let’s not forget
quarterbacks like Charles Thompson or Jamelle Holie-
way of Oklahoma. These players have to execute the op-
tion offense, one of the most difficult and complex
offenses you can run. Do these players lack the necessi-
ties to be able to call plays, read defenses and make
quick, split-second decisions just because they are black?
Example 3: Calvin Peete (you know, the golfer). Golf
has always been considered a game of nerves, concentra-
tion and strategy. For the past five years, Peete has con-
sistently been one of the PGA’s lowest scorers as well as
one of its most accurate shotmakers.

The sport of basketball is not innocent of this stereoty-
pical thinking either. Larry Bird is considered so great
because he’s so clever, so smart or so intelligent on the

floor. Magic Johnson on the other hand is able to do what
he does because he’s so athletic, so talented or so skillful.
Both statements are true but both fail to recognize that
Bird is also very athletic and that Johnson is also very in
telligent, on or off the court. The idea is that a white to
compete with a black, he must have the ‘‘mental edge”’
over him

All these prejudiced views stem into the realm of
coaching and management. There are no and never have
been any black head coaches in the NFL. There are, cur-
rently, no black managers in Major League Basehall.
There are only four black head coaches (three of whom,
have been extremely successful) in the NBA. There are
no and never have been any black head coaches in the
NHL. The problem in football and baseball have been the
most glaring. Instead of giving the positions to qualified
blacks, a predominantly white ownership is content with
hiring the same old white managers and head coaches.
How many teams does Pat Corrales have to manage be-
fore a qualified black is given the chance? How about Bil-
ly Martin? Or Marion Campbell in the NFL?

The Snyder incident will hopefully have an impact
much like Campanis’ idiotic statements: Owners and
management will wake up and realize that there are many
talented black coaches out there and all they need is a
chance; and coaches will realize that a great black athlete
does not have to be a defensive back, wide receiver or
running back, but has the brains to be a quarterback. The
racism continues in today’s sports. Let’s hope somebody
out there is willing to take the first step in ending it.

NOTES—Snyder’s firing was no surprise as CBS really
had no choice in the matter. Personally, I’m glad to see
‘‘The Greek’’ go. He was uninformative, unentertaining
and just plain lousy at picking football games. According
to Snyder’s percentages, you had a better chance of being
right by flipping a coin then listening to him... The
SuperBowl prediction: Redskins 28, Broncos 24. The
*Skins will put incredible pressure on John Elway and
Washington receiver Gary Clark will have a day that will
go down in the record books...

In a Galaxy not so far away

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Driving south on central Virginia's
Route 11 near Natural Bridge, even
the most casual passerby cannot help
but notice the calico castle sitting back
in the woods. A Star Wars ‘‘storm-
trooper’’ guards the splotchy block
castle atop his futuristic land rover
while a lengthy quote from Socrates
concerning death stops even the most
fearless adventurer; at least for a se-
cond. The castle is not dangerous nor
is it abandoned. ‘*The Enchanted Cas-
tle’’ is home, workshop, and artistic
womb for a man who is living his fan-
tasies and making his dreams come
true.

Mark Cline has known since he was
seven that he had an extraordinary
creative gift but it was not until eight
years ago that he realized what he
could do with it. It was then in 1980
that he won second prize at a local art
show with four original monsters
casted from liquid fiberglass. After
the show, Cline quipped that if he con-
tinued he would have to open a mu-
seum someday. Two years later that
dream became a reality.

Cline opened the ‘‘Monster Mu-
seum”’ in 1982 hoping to attract the

traffic heading to the World’s Fair in
Knoxville, Tennessee and that’s exac-
tly what he did. Dressed in Safari at-
tire, Cline guided his guests around
his collection of classic monsters and
screen terrors as though he were the
great monster killer from the 1940's
horror flicks. Business boomed; that
is, until the end of the fair. Realizing
he would have to make a few changes
in order to stay in business, Cline ad-
ded some elves, goblins and lepre-
chauns to his ghoulish order and
reopened under a new name.

“The Enchanted Castle’’ was
opened in 1984 and enjoyed relative
success until its doors closed to the
public in 1986. After four years as cu-
rator of the fantastical museum, Cline
decided there was more to be done
with his talent and established a com-
pany designed to do free-lance sculpt-
ing for private clients called *‘Enchan-
ted Castle Productions’’ that he runs
today out of the old museum. While
the incorporation has given Cline the
opportunity to do outside work he has
never lost sight of his own dream; that
of doing what he loves for the good of
mankind.

‘Having a gift also means having a
reponsibility’’ he says. Looking at the
picture of a starving little girl on his
refrigerator, Cline explains his recent
realization that money spent on social
vices for a few days can feed his adop-
ted African daughter for a year.

‘Everything is an illusion’? says
Cline. “‘Money, Fame, Fortune are
all illusions. The only real thing in life
is love.”

Perhaps the love of his artistry is
what has sustained Cline for the last
eight years without any real contact
with the outside world. He doesn’t
have a radio, a television, or a tele-
phone in the castle and until recently
only had a clock with thirteen hours.
Strange? Bizarre, perhaps? Maybe.
But Cline is doing what very few peo-
ple ever get the chance to do: exactly
what he has always dreamed of. After
eight years of success however, it ap-
pears that Cline’s latest dream will
have to wait.

As a native of Waynesboro, Vir-
ginia, Cline wanted to do something to
aid his economy poor home town and
decided that using his talent would be
the best answer. He devised a plan to
construct a 60-foot tall, foam and
fiberglass bust of General ‘‘Mad An-
thony’’ Wayne, whom the town is
named after, on a crest at the north
end of the city. After seeing Mount
Rushmore a few years earlier, Cline
had dreamed of creating a sculpture
like it and the Waynesboro project
was his chance. After months of plan-
ning, drawing and making scale
models, Cline’s plan was ready to pre-
sent.

The total project, he said, would
cost between $80,000 and $100,000 to

Still Hot after 33

 

By Joel E. Miller

Rumors have great bearing on the
reputation of a band, according to
Doug Clark, leader and drummer of
Doug Clark and the Hot Nuts.

One specific rumor about the Hot
Nuts has endured for over thirty
years, he says. ‘‘People always ask
me about the gig where we wore clear
plastic tuxedos,’” he says.

“This supposedly happened in the
late 1950s. Can you imagine what
would have happened to us if we'd
worn them in front of 50 white frater-
nity brothers and their dates’’?

‘*We'd be buried twelve feet under-
ground if we had done that,’’ he
laughs. ‘*People probably confused us
with some ‘Greeks’ who dropped their
shorts during one of our sets.”’

Clark, a native of Chapel Hill,
N.C., founded the group while still a
junior in high school in 1955. Along
with his brother, John, the group was
called Doug Clark and the Tops, and
consisted of twelve high school band
members. Doug, being the drum
major, naturally had his name in the ti-
tle.

The Hot Nuts play a brand of music
that is difficult to define: some hits
from the 1950s, current Top 40 songs
and, the band’s trademark, a set best
described as simple melodies with lyr-
ics that would make Prince blush.

One such song, ‘‘Nuts, Hot Nuts’’,
is rife with lyrics poking fun at var-
ious fraternities and universities, as
well as members of the audience. For
example: ‘‘In the Garden of Eden was
a man named Adam/ He had his hands
on the loins of his madame/ He smiled
with mirth/ ‘Cause he knew that on
earth/ There were only two nuts/ And
he had ‘em.’

John says, ‘“We’ve always appealed
to the college crowd because we know
how they think, how they breath, and

they can handle it when we make fun
of them.”’

Doug’s interest in forming the band
was sparked in the eighth grade when
he worked in the Sigma Nu chapter
house at the University of North Caro-
lina. He says he heard three drunken

brothers singing some songs at one of

the parties, one of which came to be
their adopted theme song.

‘‘T found out they were paid $65 to

sing those songs,”’ he says, ‘‘and they

sounded pitiful. I told one of the

Alvin-Bennis

 

Visa

 

   

brothers, ‘You pay $65 for that?’”’

When the band began to play sets
around the Chapel Hill area, John
says, people began to associate the
band with the ‘‘Hot Nuts’’ song and,
he says, ‘‘That’s where the name
came from—it doesn’t have some se-
cret meaning or anything.’

The band toured primarily through-
out the Southeast during the late 1950s
and early 1960s, signed with Gross
Records (a subsidiary of Jubilee Re-
cords, now defunct), and released
nine albums between 1961 and 1970.
Four of the albums made the ranks of
the Top Ten college play for ‘‘Bill-
board’’ magazine in the mid- 1960s.

As the band’s show reputation in-
creased, so did the range of their
tours. One year in the 1960s saw them
play sets in Colorado, New Hamp-
shire, and Oklahoma. According to
Doug, ‘‘We’ve probably played for
more college students than any other
band in the world.”’

The group, at various times during

the 1960s, opened or headlined with
groups such as James Brown and the
Flames (‘‘One of the boys who used to
be in our band, J.C. Davis, got Jimmy
discovered,’’ John revealed), Tina
Turner, Sam and Dave, Otis Redding,
the Drifters, the Platters and Chuck
Berry.
John says Chuck Berry stole the
song ‘‘My Ding-A-Ling’’ from the
Hot Nuts, but the song remains in the
band’s repertoire. ‘‘We recorded it in
1961 and he recorded it in the late
1960s. I guess somebody liked his
version better.””

The Hot Nuts’ show became an an-
nual event in the 1960s for the crowds
that swarmed Dallas every second
weekend of October for the University
of Texas-University of Oklahoma
football game. ‘‘We’d headline in
front of 2000 people and they’d go
crazy when we'd do the Hot Nuts’
theme,’’ John says. *‘They’d moon us
and we’d laugh right back at them.”

The Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at
the University of Arkansas has booked
the Hot Nuts every spring for the past
ten years for their Possum Party, in
which the brothers and their dates all
dress up in tacky clothes (‘‘That’s
what they think is tacky,’ Doug
laughs). The woman elected as the
SAE queen is dubbed ‘*‘Doug’s Pos-
sum Queen.’’ Doug says if the Hot
Nuts are booked for the weekend the
SAEs have planned the party for,
social chairmen will reschedule the
party for another weekend so that the
Hot Nuts will be able to play.

The band currently consists of seven
members: Doug, drums; John, vocals

build but was an excellent investment
when considering the economic bene-
fits it would bring to the community
such as tourism, souvenirs, and pub-
licity. The parking area for viewing,
in fact, was across the street from the
downtown Waynesboro business dis-
trict. The Waynesboro Chamber of
Commerce and civic organizations
strongly approved but the Waynes-
boro City Council was a different
story.

The City Council said that funds
had been allocated in other areas and
that they could not appropriate the
funds needed for the project. Cline
didn’t give up though. The National
General ‘‘Mad Anthony’’ Wayne His-
torical Society has offered to fund the
entire project. While Cline is unsure
about the project's next step, he is op-
timistic about its future. ‘‘Success is
figuring out what obstacles there are
in your way and working around
them,”’ he said.

Success for Mark Cline is living his
life doing what he loves to do. Great
wealth and fame aren’t preoccupations
or even thoughts. The art of creating
and entertaining is the mark of Cline’s
genius and whether it is seen in a
16-foot model of King Kong hanging
off a Texaco sign in Fairfield, Vir-
ginia or a Tyrannosaurus Rex guard-
ing the entrance to the Reptile Center
in Luray, Virginia, you can bet it’s no
illusion.

and Robert Brodi, bass (1987).

John likened the band’s reputation
to that of ‘‘Animal House,’’ which is
not too far from what many people in
the late 1970s apparently thought
when the movie ‘‘Animal House’’ was
released. He says, ‘‘A lot of people
called the producers (of ‘‘Animal
House’’) and wanted to know why we
hadn’t been used in the film instead of
Otis Day and the Knights.

“So the producers called us
up—they’d never even heard of us, I
bet—and said if they ever made a se-
quel they’d come get us.”’

But being on a movie soundtrack
may not seem so far off to the Hot
Nuts. The group has been approached
by Joel Sill, the executive music pro-
ducer for ‘‘La Bamba,”’ to record four
songs for the feature film ‘‘All-
American Hero,’’ to be released this
fall.

“You know we'll do the real popu-
lar songs,’’ John says, ‘‘and we'll
probably spice them up a little.”’

Adds Doug: ‘The guys making this
movie remembered seeing us play
somewhere a long time ago. And to
think the Hot Nuts had a lasting im-
pact on a movie producer.”’

Doug says, “‘I’m 39 years old, just
‘like Jack Benny, but I hope 20 years
down the pike that we’ll still be play-
ing for the college crowd. We'll go
over Hell and half of Georgia to play a
gig because that’s what we like to do.

‘‘Whenever we play I always look
out at the crowd and try to imagine

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Tom Wolfe entertains
standing room crowd

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-Editor

 

Tom Wolfe, Class of ’51 and a
member of the Board of Trustees
spoke last Thursday evening to a stan-
ding-room-only crowd in Evans Din-
ing Hall.

The speech, which was billed as
‘‘An Evening with Tom Wolfe,”
covered subjects ranging from the
challenge of writing fiction to new
trends of the times.

When Wolfe began college at
W&L, he said he felt as though he
needed to gain “‘riveting’’ experiences
if he was to-one day become a writer.
He recalls being jealous of one student
who had served several years in com-
bat because that student had so much
more experience than Wolfe did.

“The idea by the time I reached
Washington and Lee was that you
were going to write a realistic novel
based on your personal experiences, ””
said Wolfe.

‘*The idea was that you would reach
down your gullet, pull up your en-
trails, spread them out before the
world and become famous ever
after.”

This idea was popular at the time
‘*because it had been the great glory
of American literature.’’ During the
1930s, Sinclair Lewis won the Nobel

Prize for Literature for Babbitt, a
story about a real estate salesman
from Chicago. All the world-
recognized writers of the time wrote
about ‘‘very common ordinary
things,”’ said Wolfe.

While at W&L, Wolfe took part ina
creative writing class that met weekly
at the Dutch Inn.

**Every Wednesday night you had
to produce something and then you
read whatever you had done aloud to
the class. It could be a very painful
experience,”’ said Wolfe. Out of the
class of 10, three went on to become
published writers, a fact that says
something about the literary climate of
W&L, said Wolfe.

After graduating from W&L, Wolfe

worked as a reporter for newspapers,
including The Washington Post and
The New York Herald Tribune.

‘*The idea was that you would go to
work for a newspaper. You would
somehow work some of the fat off
your prose style, some of the fat off of
your soul. Gain some experience, and
at some point down the line you would
quit the newspaper business cold,”’
said Wolfe.

‘*You would move into a shack
somewhere, work day and night for
six months, after which you would
suddenly light up the sky with your
first novel.”’

At its meeting last weekend, the
W&L Board of Trustees approved in-
creases in tuition and fees for the
1988-89 academic year, according to
University President and board mem-
ber John D. Wilson.

The Board also nominated two new
trustees, William Lemon and Steven
Miles.

Tuition will increase to $8,900 for
next year, an increase of seven per-
cent from this year’s $8,300. Addi-
tionally, rates for rooms in University
housing have also risen from an aver-
age of $1,383 this year to an average
of $1,445 for 1988-89, a 4.5 percent

increase, said Wilson.

The cost of the 20-meal contract in
the dining hall rose to $1,980 from
this year’s $1,925, an increase of 3
percent.

The student activity fee will be $105
in 1988-89, compared to the current
$100. The Board approved the in-
crease with the recommendation of the
EC.

The Board also voted to increase the
financial aid budget, specifically the
W&L grant budget, by 10 percent.
The 1988-89 financial aid budget will
be $2,752,000, as compared to this
year’s $2,528,000, said Wilson.

The tuition and financial aid budget
must be approved at the winter meet-
ing so that Admissions may inform
prospective students, said Wilson.

At its winter meeting, the Board
mapped out a rough budget for the
University. The final budget will be
approved at the May meeting.

Among some of the items projected
for the final budget include increases
in salaries for the faculty and staff.

Additionally, the Board approved
funding for four new members of the
faculty. One position for a Japanese
instructor, one for a Russian instruc-
tor; and two positions in the music de-
partment were approved.

One of the new professors in the
music department will replace Profes-
sor Robert Stewart, who will retire at
the end of the year. The other music
instructor will ‘‘help provide contin-
ued leadership for the Rockbridge
Symphony Orchestra, ‘‘ said Wilson.

The board also nominated two new
members. William Lemon and Steven
Miles were appointed and will be
sworn in at the Board meeting in May.

The faculty has voted to take the
InterFraternity Council out of the rush
scheduling process.

At their regular monthly meeting on
Monday, the Faculty gave the Student
Affairs Committee the authority to set
up next year’s rush calendar.

Almost certain to be included in the
SAC calendar will be a deferred
pledgeship until the beginning of win-
ter term, a grade requirement of 1.9
for pledging, and a requirement that
the freshmen be initiated by the end of
the eighth week of the winter term,
said IFC President Mark Farley.

“‘I am generally pleased with the
outcome. In my opinion the faculty ac-
tion could have resulted in a January
rush, which would have been much
worse,’ Farley said.

“*However, some of the faculty ex-
pressed views that disturbed me. A
minority of the faculty appear to be
seeking an environment that I believe
is not possible as long as fraternities
exist.

“This is in sharp contrast with the
views expressed to me by the Board of
Trustees, the president of the univer-
sity, and his administration, all of
whom have been extremely suppor-

tive.

News Director Brian Shaw throws

 

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

 

Brian D. Shaw, director of the
News Office at W&L, is seeking a
seat on the Lexington City Council.

Shaw said it has always been some-
thing he has wanted to do. He added
that he is not dissatisfied with the cur-
rent City Council.

However, he said ‘‘I’d like to be in
that role [of a councilman] because I
want to make a difference in the Lex-
ington community.’’ Shaw said since
there was a vacancy, he would take
advantage of it.

Shaw grew up in Greensboro, N.C.
He received a B.A. in English from
the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro. Upon graduating from
UNC-G, Shaw went to work for the
Greensboro News and Record. He
worked at various papers in North
Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia be-
fore coming to Lexington in 1981 as

Shenandoah Bureau chief for the
Roanoke Times & World News.

In 1983 Shaw joined the family
business, Star Food Marts, Inc. and
then re-joined the Greensboro News
and Record in 1985. He remained in
that position until August of that year,
when he was named director of the
News Office at W&L, the position he
currently hoids.

Many of the activities Shaw is local-
ly involved in are relevant to some of
the issues he thinks are important to
the City Council.

For the past two years Shaw has
directed the junior division of the
Maury River Soccer Club, and last
year served as a co- coach in Lexing-
ton Youth Basketball League. He said
a city recreation program is impor-
tant.

‘It helps to involve people within
the community,’’ Shaw said. ‘‘Lex-
ington used to be known for its recrea-
tion programs back in the 1960s,’” he
said.

‘Different newspapers wrote re-
views of how Lexington’s recreation
programs should be copied, but now

not as many programs have contin-
ued.’’

A major issue Shaw stressed was
the consolidation of schools and
government. ‘*Lexington [and its sur-
rounding areas] have three different
forms of government,’’ he said, ‘‘It is
wasteful in an area of 30,000 people to
have three different systems.”

® Shaw said Lexington has very little
income because about 56 percent of its
lands is non-taxable. These lands are
held by the two universities in town,
W&L and VMI. Shaw said the city
needs to support a downtown de-
velopment to bring in more income.

He said adding a few hotels or inns
in the downtown area would help to
generate income. A possible location
for a hotel could be across from the
Hunter & Huntress on Randolph
Street, Shaw said. Since most of the
hotels and motels are outside the city,
Lexington is deprived of much-needed
income. Shaw said a similar situation
applies to businesses.

schools and government would en-

- City Council zoning proposal endangers student housing

 

By Alan Greeter
Staff Reporter

 

W&L student housing faces major
ramifications tonight when Lexington
City Council is expected to vote on the
definition of a family for zoning pur-
poses within the city.

The controversial subject has raised
debate between advocates of student
housing within the city, and those
supporting lower ind middle income
residents of Lexington, who feel in-
vaded by the influx of student resi-
dents in their neighborhoods.

The present city »rdinance defining
a family only allow: for two unrelated
individuals to live ir @ Single dwelling
home as a family.

Although this ordnance has not
been enforced in the vast, individuals

supporting low and moderate income
citizens at the Jan. 21 council meeting
recommended that the present ordin-
ance be enforced before another one
was even considered.

Advocates for lower income hous-
ing stated that landlords have been
purchasing housing for student needs
rather than family needs.

Lexington landlord William Stearns
said, ‘‘a majority of my tenants are
students, and I have not had any real
problems with them.”’

Stearns, who owns approximately
40 rental units in the Lexington com-
munity, supports the definition pro-
posed by the Social and Economic
Services Committee allowing four un-
related individuals to live in a single
dwelling unit, with possible condi-
tional use permits for dwellings with
up to eight individuals.

In order for these permits to be is-
sued the dwelling must provide a se-
parate bedroom for each individual
living in the building, and the house
must meet other minimum building
codes.

Another problem that Stearns said
was of importance in this matter was
the problems surrounding _ noise,
trash, and parking.

*‘In order to receive the conditional
use permits we are going to be re-
quired to set high standards, and if the
students have a problem complying
with the standards I will have to evict
them,”’ Stearns said.

Stearns also thinks that the amnesty
period allowing property owners to
comply with the new ordinance be 10
years rather than the 2-year period
recommended in the committee’s re-
port

The committee had originally pro-
posed a 10-year amnesty period but
revised that time period afier oppo-
sition from low income residents.

Besides the report from the Social
and Economic Services Committee,
the minority report signed by Coun-
cilman A.C. Jordan will be considered'
by the council. Jordan’s report asks
for the definition of a family to remain
at two unrelated individuals, and for
the amnesty period to last until June
30, 1989.

If the council decides to accept the
proposal outlined in the minority re-
port, many W&L students might be
forced to find housing outside of the
Lexington community.

Assistant Dean of Students and Re-
sident Housing Kenneth P. Ruscio
said there are currently more applica-
tions for student housing than can be

filled.

‘“‘Capacity in Gaines Hall is be-
tween 230-240, and at this time we
have more than 300 applications,”’
Ruscio said. Ruscio also expects
Woods Creek Apartments to be filled
with both law students and undergra-
duates.

Although Ruscio said he expects
some of the students to withdraw their
applications for University housing,
he does believe a decision limiting the
number of unrelated individuals to
only two would have serious implica-
tions on student housing.

The five-member Social and Econ
omic Services Committee is also look-
ing at the possibility of establishing a
housing authority to handle the in
creasing housing problems.

omics Business Partnership Founda-

A group of board members have
agreed to create a list of financial
plans to help fund the Fraternity
House Renovation Project. The Board
was presented with a report from
architects on the projected costs of
renovating each fraternity house.

“(The report] gives a very large,
crude idea of what would be involved,
but it gives us enough to go on to try to
develop a financing option,‘‘ said
Wilson.

that would benefit everyone,’’ Shaw
said. According to him, a more inte-
grated system among government,
schools and business would help to al-
leviate costs, encourage more coop-
eration and promote unity among Lex-
ingtonians.

Other activities Shaw is involved in
include being president of the Rock-
bridge unit of the American Cancer
Society and being a member of the
Lexington Rotary Club. He served as
spokesman for Citizens for the Repeal
of the Blue Law, a group that worked
successfully last year to permit Sun-
day shopping in Lexington and Rock-
bridge County.

Shaw has also handled the public re-
lations for the Rockbridge Christmas
Basket Program and the Tasters
Choice benefit for the Yellow Brick
Road Day Care Center. For the last
two years Shaw and his wife, Cheryl,
have organized the Fourth of July
children’s parade in downtown Lex-
ington,

Shaw added, ‘‘If elected, I will
work very hard, for, whatever is good
for the area, is good for Lexington.”’

OPINION

 

The road to Hell
is paved with

good intentions

At its most recent meeting the faculty told the Student Affairs
Committee to create a rush calendar without the input of the Inter-
Fraternity Council. While the SAC has always held that power,
they have usually allowed the IFC to develop a calendar and then to
submit it to the SAC for approval. This year, the SAC will create a
calendar that will most likely be completely different from the one
developed by the IFC. The proposed SAC calendar would delay the
start of pledgeship until the beginning of winter term, establish a
minimum GPA of 1.9 before pledging, and require initiation of
pledges by the end of the eighth week of winter term. Additionally,
the new calendar will stay in effect until the university completes a
self-study sometime in the early 1990s. We feel there are several
serious problems with the proposal.

First, even though SAC was never required to consult with the
IFC, it was an act of good faith that it did. In general, rush this year
went very smoothly. The majority of the houses responded to the
SAC’s gesture by obeying the rush rules the fraternities had a hand
in creating. To bypass the IFC is to ignore the people who are most
knowledgeable about how a fraternity works. The faculty is not fa-
miliar will the intricacies of running a fraternity. To allow them to
decide without the input of the fraternities which rush calendar
would work best would be similar to allowing the students to decide
the curriculum. Neither group has the expertise to make the best de-
cisions.

Second, the new rush schedule will be in effect until the univer-
sity completes it’s self-study on all aspects of the university, includ-
ing a specific section on ‘‘all facets of the freshman year.’’ The uni-
versity plans to complete the study sometime in the early 1990s.
This means that, for at least two years, the students will have no in-
put into the rush calendar. If the study is delayed, the students will
be excluded even longer. Two years!? It took less than six months
to complete the Iran-Contra report. Certainly the Congress’ report
was no less comprehensive than the university’s study.

Third, the minimum GPA requirement, while an excellent idea,
is unfair. For the university as a whole, freshmen go on academic
probation only when their GPA is less than 1.5. Even if they fall be-
low that level they still may participate in one extra-curricular acti-
vity. Under the SAC proposal any freshman who falls below a 1.9
will not be allowed to pledge. Why is the requirement for fraterni-
ties so much more strict than for the university as a whole? Does
pledging a fraternity really take any more time than participating in
athletics or singing in the university chorus? © © =

Fourth, the eight week pledge program is far too short. Admitte-
dly the current pledge program is too long, but there has to be some
compromise. Most fraternities require their pledges to pass an exam
before initiation. Does the faculty really believe that shortening the
pledge program will make the academic pressure on the freshmen
less intense? Instead of pledgeship being spread out over seven
months the SAC proposal will cram it into eight weeks. That seems
to guarantee increased strain on the freshmen. Twelve or fifteen
weeks is much more realistic. The programs would still be shor-
tened from their current inflated length but the freshmen would
have more time to complete the necessary preparations for initia-
tion. ‘

Finally, it seems that every year the faculty expects more and
more concessions from the fraternities. At first the requests were
reasonable. In light of the new liability laws the changes were
necessary. Now, the faculty, swelled with their past successes, has
decided to try to force fraternities into the background. Last year
the houses conceded a shorter rush and stricter alcohol regulations
because the faculty implied it would not press for further re-
strictions if the allowances were made. Overall, rush went very
well this past year. The majority of the houses followed the new
rules and those that didn’t were punished. Now the faculty wants
stricter rules. Where does it stop? Will the faculty eventually want
to decide which freshmen pledge which house?

The SAC proposal, while some of its intentions are good, is
dangerously misguided. We approve of the faculty’s attempts to
improve the fraternity system. However, the new proposals are un-
just and harmful to both fraternities and freshmen. The faculty is
endangering something that has been an important part of W&L for
over 125 years.

Wall Street

induces
reaction

SURNAMES UR Aimee eRe
MY VIEW
By Kathy Morrison

 

I certainly wish I'd waited until bar-
gain night to see Wall Street. Though I
do not consider myself a professional
movie reviewer, I do feel qualified to
attest to the accuracy of the following
quick summary:

Yuck.

I usually try to find at least a little
merit in even the worst of films--I
managed to sit through Bruce Willis’
Blind Date once--but' I was sorely
tempted to walk out on Wall Street.
The acting in the tough-guy trading
scenes was artificial at best; these
guys talked about stocks like Stallone
talks about blowing up Commies, ex-
cept with more four-letter words and
enough C-school terminology to make
an econ-major’s head swim. As if eu-
logizing a day on the phone selling
stock wasn’t bad enough, the audience
is also subjected to intermittent bouts
of father-son bonding that would make
even the most hardened dewy-eyed,
bleeding-heart moviephile feel like
retching.

Though the casting was probably
the least of many evils found in Wall
Street, the characters were unbearably
implausible.,.maybe because of their
unbelievable situations. Nevertheless,
Martin Sheen could have done a lot
more with his admittedly poor role.
The obvious fact that the father-and-
son- in-real-life didn’t quite come off
for the father-and-son-in-the- movie
was perhaps one of the most dis-
appointing aspects of the film. Charlie
Sheen wasn’t too convincing as the
good-boy-turned- bad-turned-good-
again, but he did have the pasty
dough-boy complexion one might ex-
pect young blossoming brokers to

haye.

Though it was difficult to sort the
good guys from the bad guys (not, by
the way, because of any cleverness in
the development but rather because of
twisted moral statements and a ten-
uous coherency) Michael Douglas as
Gekko at least looked like the slime-
ball he portrayed. Darryl Hannah
was...well, Darryl Hannah. The most
convincing performance during this
hour-and-a-half of hell was given by
Gekko’s fat son Rudy, who appeared
once and acted just like a three-year-
old.

The most annoying aspect of this
miserable flick aside from the charac-
ters themselves was what these char-
acters said. It’s entirely possible to
lose sleep over such trite maxims and
mini- moral lessons as ‘‘You know,
sometimes money makes you do
things you don’t want to.”’ This and
other Earth-shaking spiritual and
economic revelations were spouted
from the mouth of Hal Holbrook’s
largely forgettable character. The ac-
tion wasn’t much better than the dia-
logue, complete with the obligatory
sex-and- drugs-in-a-limo scene, the
collage of dirty under-handed trading
scenes and continual ludicrous at-
tempts to put energy into the dreary
concept of buying and selling stocks
with other people’s money.

The fatal error inherent in Wall
Street is the assumption that the depic-
tion of such business as exciting, her-
oic, even noble is enough to carry the
entire movie. It may be that the aver-
age cinema-lover, a businessman him-
self, will find the depiction flattering
and even interesting; however, to the
non-business oriented, this approach
to an otherwise deathly boring reality
cannot work without proper attention
to the human aspect of the movie.
People watch movies in order to be en-
tertained--what entertains the most is,
in my opinion, watching other people.
Wall Street stresses the money, how
it’s won and lost, its power and its
price...but at no time does one feel
anything concerning the characters
but a slight frustration. No matter how
hard one might try to like the good
guy and hate the bad guy, it just
doesn’t happen and disappointment
results.

Indeed, it is hard to say which of the
manifold emetic aspects of this film
deserves to be called the worst; the
rancid denouement, the forced
schmaltz, the crippled attempt at mak-
ing a statement, the graphics right out
of 1973, the lame, lifeless characters,
etc., etc. To borrow a phrase from
Siskel and Ebert, even the plot itself
was ‘turgid, sour and ugly.’’ Perhaps
the creators of Wall Street intended to
appeal to the current wave of yuppie-
dom, but I doubt this film holds appeal
even for the indiscriminate tastes of
the young middle class.

Writer urges formation of
non-smoking section in Co-op

i ie eee
MY VIEW

By Margaret Pimblett

 

It’s time to add more fuel to the fire of
dispute about how to improve the
University Co-op/Bookstore atea. I’-
ve heard enough about the need for
quicker service, lower prices, better
food, more junk food, less junk food,
a wider variety of food, thicker milk-
shakes, hotter French fries and mea-
tier hamburgers. Now let’s talk about
what’s really important--the health of
those students and faculty members
who frequent the co-op for breakfast,
lunch or snacks. No, I’m not talking
about the dangers of co-op hot dogs.
As far as I can tell, they’re not only
safe to eat, but marginally tasty as
well. Just be sure to shake up the ket-
chup before you put in on--and ponder
carefully the chili dilemma.

The issue at hand is the need for a
non-smoking area in the university
snack bar. Wait!! Hold on, all you
readers who have just screamed,
‘‘There’s not enough space in there
now!!! If you make a non-smoking
area we'll never have room to sit
down! **You see, I’ve already thought
of that. Yes, the co-op needs more
seating space, but I doubt any current
students will see such room mate-
rialize while they are still undergra-
duates. We'll just have to work
around that problem.

Rumors

 

In order to clear up any lingering misunder-
standings remaining in the minds of W&L stu-
dents about the Trident organization and the acti-
vities it sponsors, we, the Executive Council, re-
spectfully submit the following letter.

. First, we would like to make it absolutely clear
that we are not subsidized by the University in any
way. The only school- related funds that we were
granted include $500 received through petition to
the Executive Committee. The E.C. appropriated
that money to us for the sole purpose of purchas-
ing office supplies and covering printing costs -
if we do not use it to defray the cost of any social

I also understand that a good num-
ber of students, if not a majority of
students, are cigarette smokers. I’m
not about to tell anyone that they
should not be allowed to smoke in the
co-op.

However, (and this is a big
“*however‘‘), there are also a number
of non-smoking students and faculty
who patronize the co-op. Why should
those people be forced to smell ciga-
rette smoke while they are attempting
to enjoy a delectable co-op luncheon,
served with a smile by the wonderful
ladies and gentlemen who work there?

Of course, some of the non-smokers
would choose to sit with smokers. I
know I do, if I’m eating lunch with
friends who smoke. I certainly do not
think I have the right to tell them over
the pleasure of less polluted air. I
would continue to occasionally sit
with smoking friends in a smoking
area if my friends were to be unable to
eat a meal without smoking. But the
issue of whether non-smoking areas
are necessary in public places has
been argued for years. California has
outlawed smoking on all airline flights
originating or ending in the state that
are longer than two hours in duration.
Restaurants throughout the country
have tables set aside for those who do
not smoke. It’s time the co-op had
some area set aside, as well.

The problem, as I’ve already pro-
posed, is where to put a non-smoking
area. Let’s dwell on that point for a
moment. We would most likely want
the smoking area away from the food
preparation area, simply for sanitary
health reasons. We also have to have a
proper ratio of smoking seats to
non-smoking seats. I realize this is

We deeply regret that our only two social func- '
tions, proposed with the intent of providing a
social alternative for the undergraduate women,
have met with such resistance and negative feed- ’
back. However, it is heartening to receive such
enthusiastic response from those who have parti-
cipated. A special thank you goes to all whose
time and efforts made the ‘‘Winter Slosh‘* possi-
ble, in addition to all those who supported our
event with their attendance. We hope that this ‘
kind of positive response is an indication of the
pending success of ‘*Confetti’s 1988.‘*

Starting to sound like’an airline, but
bear with me.

As the co-op is now arranged, there
are 24 seats in the small room on the
east side of the building, toward the
Lee-Jackson House.

Three booths are available along the
wall in front of the short-order
counter, because the fourth booth is ,
reserved for employee breaks.

Five more booths are situated along’
the wall on the other side of the double’
entrance doors.

*

And approximately 25 seats are,
available at the tables in the remainder
of the coop area. :

If the small room and the three”
booths were set aside for non-+
smokers, I figure 36 seats would be
available (with four people at each
booth). ’

By the same measure, 45 seats’
would be available for smokers. ‘

I think the 36-45 ratio is a legitimate ,
figure for non-smokers to smokers
who patronize the Co-op. :

But my individual view, as it is, will ‘
not a non-smoking area make. I’ve,
talked to the manager of the co-op,
Richard Armstrong, about the idea, |
and he was open to suggestions. If you .
have an opinion about this issue,
please, let yourself be heard. Write to
the Phi, talk to Mr. Armstrong or :
Gerry Darrell, the director of food
services for W&L. Only by airing our
views will they know whether a:
change is in order, or whether this

aquires

‘Liberty Hill’ property

 

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

Recently a new piece of property
came into W&L’s possession. Perhaps
not many people were aware that the
area near Liberty Hall was not entirely
owned by the University—not until
late last November, when the money
to buy the land was donated by two
W&L alumni, according to Frank
Parsons, executive assistant to the
president.

The piece of property includes a red
brick house near Route 60, and the
immediate area surrounding it. The
house was first built by Dr. H.L. Mit-
chell in 1941. Later it came into the
hands of Joseph Niekirk, who has re-
sided there for many years, said Par-
sons.

Niekirk, now retired, is a former
executive director of the VMI Founda-
tion, an agency that raises money for
VMI through alumni support.

When Niekirk received word that a
place for him was available in a re-
tirement home in Lynchburg where he
had been think about moving, the an-
nouncement arrived unexpectedly and

he saw that he would have to dispose
of the property quickly. He offered it
to W&L on a first-refusal basis.

Parsons saw this offer would be a
worthwhile investment. He stated the
importance of the property lay in its
values as ‘*...a historic site...and a
frequently used entry to back cam-
pus.

Parsons also mentioned how toler-
ant Niekirk had been with regard to all
the traffic past his house as people
drive by for athletic events or fes-
tivities held at the Pavilion, and added
that a good rapport had always been
maintained between Niekirk and the
school concerning his house’s location
surrounded by W&L property.

Another owner might not have been
as cooperative as the Niekirks, and
Parsons added, there would have been
no guarantee that the place would have
been kept up as well as it has been if
someone totally new were to move in.

Parsons made a presentation to the
Board of Trustees, and as a result, the
land was purchased from Niekirk by
the school with the help of a generous
donation from two alumni who had at-
tended the meeting.

According to Farris Hotchkiss, Se-
cretary of the Board of Trustees, a gift

of $25,000 is still needed to complete
the funding, and will presumably be
provided by a third donor. Until then,
the first two donors wish to remain
anonymous.

Since this was the only portion of
that land on the ridge that was not ow-
ned by W&L, Parsons felt that the
land would serve well in development
interests.

WA&L recently bought this house and property near Liberty Hall.

The house may become the resi-
dence of a dean, or it would serve as
an ideal place to hold alumni social
events, as there is more than enough
parking space for the numerous
alumni who come to such functions
every year.

Whatever the use of ‘‘Liberty Hill’’
(as the Niekirks called it) turns out to
be, it is certainly a welcome addition
to the campus, said Parsons.

Visiting black instructor to join faculty

 

By Rob MacPherson
Staff Reporter

 

An undetermined department at
W&L will have a visiting black facul-
ty member next year as part of the
university’s new ABD teaching pro-
gram.

The program, whose name stands
for ‘‘All But Dissertation,’’ will give
a black graduate student who has met
all doctoral requirements except for
the completion of his or her disserta-
tion, an opportunity to teach one or
two courses and experience life as a
faculty member of a four-year liberal
arts college.

In addition, the individual will be
expected to complete his or her disser-
tation, said John Elrod, dean of the
college.

The individual will be considered a
member of the faculty and will have
the opportunity to become involved in
all faculty matters, Elrod said. Upon
completion of the dissertation, the in-
dividual will become a candidate for
any job vacancies at W&L for which
he or she is qualified to fill, the dean
said.

Elrod wrote to what he called the
‘eight major graduate teaching insti-
tutions in the Mid-atlantic and South-
eastern regions of the United States’’
in search of interested candidates. He
said all but one school replied and he
saw that as encouraging.

All of the respondent’s names were
placed in a pool and the university is
currently narrowing down the candi-
dates, Elrod said.

According to the dean, a candidate’s
area of study will not have a bearing
on the university’s decision.

“‘We’re going to choose the most
talented candidate in the pool,’’ Elrod
said.

The decision will be made by the
dean in conjunction with the depart-
ment to which the candidate will be
assigned. The chosen candidate will
visit W&L and meet with members of
the faculty.

vElrod said the ABD program, as
opposed to normal hiring procedures,
will enable the university to find a
black potential faculty member much
more easily. He said it is important for

W&L to have a black faculty member
and, because there are so few black
doctoral candidates, the ABD pro-
gram will give the university a head
Start.

Naturally, once the chosen candi-
date completes his or her dissertation,
he or she will no longer qualify for the
program. However, Elrod said he
hopes the individual chosen for the
program will learn whether or not he
or she would like to teach at a school
like W&L.

“If they seek employment at a four-
year liberal arts school and we have an
opening, they will be considered,’’ he
said. Le

In addition to the ABD. sélection,
the university will have a_ visiting
black professor from Hobart College
next winter term.

Lawyer stresses balance between career and family

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

Mary Natkin, the Director of the
Legal Writing Program at W&L’s
School of Law, spoke to a group of
women and one man on the topic of
‘‘Women in Law: One Woman’s
Perspective.’’ Her lecture on Jan. 28
was a part of the opening ceremonies
for the Arlington Women’s Center.

Natkin, who is also an associate of
law at the law firm of Natkin, Heslep,
and Natkin, focused on the problems
of balancing a career and a family.
She said that women suffer from the
‘‘problem of burnout and the super-
woman complex.’

‘*You’re not used to being unable to
handle it all. All throughout high

school, college, and law school, you
have succeeded.’’ She explained that
“‘in big city firms such as New York
and Atlanta, 40 hours a week is a part-
time work week, while 60 to 80 hours
is average.”’

She indicated that law firms are rec-
ognizing women’s need to work part-
time and desire to send their children
to day care close to the office. For ex-
ample, although it is not a law firm,
*‘Dominion Bank in Roanoke has an
on-site day care center. The producti-
vity is up and absenteeism is down.”’

Now that women are working part-
time, a few new problems have sur-
faced. One side effect of part-time sta-
tus Natkin mentioned is ‘‘the fact that
women took part-time status for five
years comes up when [the senior
members] discuss partnership. This
isn’t good. Furthermore, in considera-
tion for families, law firms may hand

out less demanding cases. This hurts
the diversity of cases the women have
handled when their name comes up for
partnership consideration.”

**T had a problem with part-time be-
cause I was cramming a whole day’s
work load into 6 hours,”’ said Natkin.
**No one knows what the long-term
effects are but it is a positive step that
means that the firms are recognizing
the problem of balancing [work and
family.]”’

Another element she discussed was
equality for women in the law profes-
sion. As far as law school is concer-
ned, Natkin said, that ‘‘women com-
prise 47 percent of students in law
school nationwide, and, while it is
only 40 percent at W&L, they are
catching up.”’

“There have been no situations
where people have not wanted to talk

to me because I am a woman,”’ said
Natkin.

She was hired by one man because
he said, ‘“‘Every woman lawyer I
know is more prepared than any
male.’’ Natkin also said that other sen-
timents indicate that women are
dreaded by male lawyers in court be-
cause they are better prepared. She
suggested that the intense preparation
could be due to self-doubt and the de-
sire to prove competence.

She stressed to women, ‘‘The term,
working mother, is redundant. That
second job is a full-time job.”’

Natkins’ message was
clear—women can succeed in the law
profession, but they must learn to bal-
ance career and family. ‘‘I balance off
whether a child’s fever is 102 as op-
posed to how long a memo is that I
have to write. I just take it one day at a
time.”’

Students plan to revive

Southern Collegian

 

By Jennifer Bandrowski
Staff Reporter

 

‘From now on SEX is spelled
Southern Collegian...ask Harry.”’
These signs have been appearing all
over campus as a spoof on the just-as-
mysterious ‘*Ask Josh’’ posters.

The signs were posted by sopho-
mores R.J. Thomas and Greg Euston,
who are trying to revive Southern Col-
legian, a humor magazine that was
published at W&L for 99 years until it
folded in 1968.

Greg Euston first got the idea over
Thanksgiving break when his father, a
W&L alumnus (’65), ‘*...asked how
Harry Collegian was...I had to say
that they didn’t make it [Southern Col-
legian| anymore,’’ Euston said.

‘‘Harry Collegian was to Southern
Collegian what Alfred E. Newman is
to National Lampoon,’’ Thomas ex-
plained.

Euston described him as ‘‘over-
weight, underdressed, dirty, unsha-
ven, drunk, and carrying a large
church key.”’

‘After break, I went and looked in
some old issues and it was very
funny...1 thought it was a neat idea,’’
Euston said.

“‘And I thought that it was even
neater,’’ Thomas added.

The magazine ‘‘... began in 1869 as
a journal of academic activities around
the South, published here at Washing-
ton and Lee,’’ Thomas explained.
‘Over the following century, the Col-
legian’s format evolved from the
journal into a literary and finally, in
the mid-SOs into an all humor for-
mat.”’

The magazine circulated four times
a year at schools throughout the
South, and had contributing editors at
many nearby schools.

‘Every time that something good
came up, they used it,’’ Euston said.

member staff who hoped to contribute
cartoons, photos, short stories,
plays,...light literary stuff.’’

Major corporations, such as R.J.
Reynolds and Lifesavers candy, ad-
vertised in the Collegian. ‘‘In 1968 it
ran an ad for presidential candidate
Ronald Reagan, who was then running
as a Democrat,’’ Euston said.

Euston and Thomas have been
working on the project, ‘‘for about a
month now.’’ They submitted their
proposal to the Publications Board on
Monday, Jan. 24.

Euston said, ‘‘We have a Feb. 29
deadline to come up with a synopsis
explaining the types of articles and
stories, and how many people are
committed to work.’’ Currently they
have five prospective staff members.
‘*We need a cartoonist!’ Euston em-
phasized, ‘‘or at least an artist.””

They are hoping to have the first is-
sue of the renewed Southern Collegian
published by alumni weekend. ‘This
was chosen so we can give the maga-
zine to both alumni and students and
gain the popular support that we
need,’’ Thomas said.

Currently they are working on sell-
ing advertisements. They are also,
‘*...sending information to other
schools: the girls’ schools, Hampden-
Sydney, and VMI,”’ Euston said.

Thomas explained that the original
publication folded because of **...the
time period, they were worried about
it getting out of hand.”’

According to Euston, there had
been controversy over ‘‘...two frontal
nude shots in the next to last issue...
and a centerfold candid shot of an
orgy that was really a classical reli-
gious painting....but we're not going
to put that in.”’

“We're going to put out a good
magazine probably in good taste,”’
Thomas added.

in the revival of the Southern Colle-
gian should contact R.J. Thomas or

This plan rarely worked out, said
Wolfe, and, for the time being, he lost
interest in writing a novel. He became
interested in writing non-fiction in a
fictional style.

‘‘The interest for me had now be-
come the writing of non- fiction, and
particularly, the use of techniques that
had here- before used only in novels
and short stories.””

Wolfe said he first came up with the
idea in the late 1960s of writing a non-
fiction book similar to Vanity
Fair about New York.

This idea eventually evolved into
his first novel, The Bonfire of the Van-
ities.

One of the most difficult and unex-
pected problems of writing fiction for
Wolfe was keeping one step ahead of
reality.

‘‘The imagination of the novelist is
powerless before what we will see in
the paper tomorrow,’’ said Wolfe.

‘‘The idea is that we live in such a
bizarre period that there is no way that
a novelist, simply drawing upon his
own mind can keep up with the events
of real life all around us.”’

in the book because they had occurred
in real life. One scene in which the
main character is threatened by a gang
of teenagers had to be cut before it ap-
peared in the serial because Bernard
Goetz had been confronted with a
similar situation in reality.

Wolfe’s skills as a journalist helped
him to create an accurate and creadi-
ble novel. Zhe Bonfire of the Vanities
is about a stock broker who finds him-
self on trial when he is involved in a
hit and run accident in the Bronx.

In order to research the novel, Wo-
Ife went to Wall Street and witnessed
the goings-on of stock brokerages. He
sat in at the court proceedings in the
Bronx Courthouse. He sat with
prisoners in holding cells and visited
the roughest parts of New York City.

Wolfe said that his next literary
project will be a novel. ‘‘I must con-
fess that I now find the temptation to
do another novel overwhelming,’’ he
said.

“I don’t know what it will be about,
but I know it will be based upon re-
porting. I devoutly hope it will not
take the six years that The Bonfire of
the Vanities did because none of us
live that long.’’

Greg Morcroft, senior, ‘‘I person-
ally enjoyed it because I wanted Doug
Williams to have a good game, and he
did.”’

sive of physical education under
the 300 level), and if their success
is endangered by the extra work,
the overload may be reduced or
eliminated upon recommendation
of their adviser and approval of the
appropriate academic dean (Pep-
pers, Elrod, Williams) without a
recorded grade, provided the re-
duction is made on or before the
mid-point of the term. If a reduc-
tion is made subsequently, a grade
of F will be entered for the cour-
se(s) dropped. (see page 52,
1987-88 Catalog)

In the case of an overload being
reduced by dropping a course
which is being repeated, the grade
of record shall be an F and shall be
counted in the current term. (see

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

The W&L basketball team did not
get a pleasant welcome when it
traveled to Danville, Va. to play
Averett College on Tuesday night.

“You can say this: the court was
small, the officiating was questiona-
ble, there were two starters who wer-
en’t really playing—one didn’t go on
the trip— and they shot 70 percent
from the floor,’’ said head coach
Verne Canfield. ‘‘But we got our butts
kicked. We got beat.”’

The Generals, 15-4, lost 84-70 as
Averett shot 69 percent from the

The W&L wreatiitig® ‘etn Neue a’
close match last night to Virginia State
in Doremus gymnasium.

The final score was 27-24 as the
Generals dropped the final two weight
classes by pins. W&L, on the strength
of three Va. State forfeits, had taken a
24-15 lead.

Saturday, at Longwood, Va., W&L
won one of three matches at the
Longwood Invitational. The Generals
beat Ferrum 59-0 as three W&L wres-
tlers won by pins: senior John Lowe at
134 Ibs.; junior Mark Robertson at
167 and junior Manoli Loupassi at
190. Senior Kevin McNamara won by
technical fall at 158.

W&L then lost to Virginia State (its
first match against State during the

' week) 31-14 and Norfolk State 24-18.

The Generals were led by two wres-
tlers who have overcome recent phy-
sical problems. McNamara, who just
recovered from a bout with the
chicken pox, won all three of his mat-
ches. Robertson, who has recovered

from a knee injury, also won all of

three of his bouts.

two points with a little over five
minutes remaining in the game before
it was outscored 19-7 the rest of the
way. Senior forward Gary Schott was
ill and did not travel and senior center
Harmon Harden was hampered
throughout the game by a stomach
virus.

Poor shooting also hampered the
Generals. Senior guard Steve Han-
cock, the team’s leading scorer, fin-
ished with only nine points on 4-13
shooting from the floor (0-5 from
3-point distance) and W&L as a team

Averett hands WA&L its fourth loss

17 points respectively.

The loss came three days after the
Generals destroyed Lynchburg 96-63
at the Warner Center on Saturday
night. That win put W&L at 7-3 in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
(tied for second) and in good position
to finish in one of the top-four spots in
the final standings, earning home-
court advantage for the first round of
the ODAC tournament.

The Generals play host to Emory

Men swimmers sweep two meets

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

In terms of competition, the W&L
men’s swim team pretty much had the
weekend off last week. In terms of
breaking records, the Generals had a
field day.

Making its first road trip of the
season, W&L, 5-1, defeated Shepherd
56-39 and Gettysburg 94-54, but this
was not a trip in which the Generals
were especially concerned with the
Opposition.

Against Shepherd, W&L went with
a ‘‘protected’’ lineup, moving some of
its top swimmers to different events
and allowing other swimmers, who
hadn’t had as much competition, an
opportunity to participate. It was not a
meet in which the final outcome,

team-wise, was ever in jeopardy.

**We swam, we won the meet with
no problem,’’ said head coach Page
Remillard. ‘‘Guys got to swim
different events and, all in all, it was
just basically a ho-hummer. What was
nice is that it allowed a lot of new
people to swim.”’

The Gettysburg meet was not the
same story. The Generals decided to
liven things up and established five
pool records. The team records came
in the 200-yard medley relay
(1:40.99) and the 800-yard free relay
(7:27.82), and the individual records
came with sophomores Adam Morgan
in the 400-yard individual medley
(4:19.53), David Olson in the
100-yard backstroke and Shawn Cope-
land in the 100-yard breaststroke
(1:02.09). W&L alumnus John Hud-

son (78) already held two Gettysburg
pool records.

*“When we came in, the guys no-
ticed ([Gettysburg’s] new record
board,’ said Remillard, ‘‘and they
noticed that a W&L alum from °78,
John Hudson, held a couple of the re-
cords. Then they started looking at the
times and then they got a little bit ex-
cited and decided to go for a few.’’

‘**We work an awful lot on game
plans,’’ he continued. ‘‘Our game
plan was really good in respect to the
individuals. People swam their races
strategically sound. That’s something
we've worked on all season and I’m
really excited by that.’’

On Saturday, W&L will take on
William and Mary at 2:00 p.m. in Cy
Twombly Pool.

llinesses hurt women’s chances

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

Although the losses to Shepherd and
Gettysburg were disappointments for
the W&L women’s swim team, head
coach Page Remillard thought the
team’s timing could actually have
been advantageous. Considering the
women had to compete without three
important swimmers, they are proba-
bly fortunate to have been scheduled
against Shepherd and Gettysburg.
Even though Gettysburg has the best
record, it was a meet W&L could af-
ford to lose.

Remillard did not dwell on the
defeats. ‘‘It’s just the luck of the
draw. Last year we happened to be
lucky. Statistically, we know that al-
most everyone gets sick in the third

 

   

the right weekend strategically,’’ he
said.

Junior Elizabeth Miles and fresh-
man Kristen Wagner were ill and not
able to travel. Junior Nancy Whalen
competed in only one event. The re-
sults of the meets were Shepherd
63-30, and Gettysburg 98-57, but as-
sistant coach Liz McKnight was still
proud of the team’s performance.

‘“‘They swam extremely well in
tough circumstances. Besides the flu
absences, the pool at Shepherd was
non-regulation and ‘slow.’ So there
was even more for the women to
overcome,’ she said.

Two women in particular per-
formed well, producing Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference best times.
Freshman Rachelle Nock and Sharon
Coleman swam superior races in the

butterfly, respectively.

Despite these achievements, Remil-
lard thought the team did not swim
well at Shepherd. He attributed the
performance to a combination of ill-
ness and post-success syndrome.

If W&L swims better against Hol-
lins next Saturday, Remillard is opti-
mistic about a General’s victory.

McKnight also has faith in the team
and commented on the upcoming
ODAC championships.

“IT think we’ll swim well. It’s a very
strong team as a whole,”’ she said.

Remillard agrees with McKnight’s
assessment.

‘‘We can put pressure on Sweet
Briar [W&L’s main competitor] at the
championship. If everyone swims her

Dancing for those whocan't

Krom Staff Reports

W&L will stage its tenth annual
Superdance to benefit the Muscular
Dystrophy Association Feb. 6 and 7 in
the Student Activities Pavilion. The
dance will begin at noon on Sat., Feb.
6, and finish at | a.m., Feb. 7.

Organizers of the 15-hour marathon
have set a goal of raising $30,000 for
MDA through the dance and related
activities, including the popular

pie-throwing events that feature mem-
bers of the W&L faculty and adminis-
tration as targets.

A year ago about 167 individuals
danced in the event, which raised
more than $33,152 for the Muscular
Dystrophy Association.

Superdance tri-chairmen, Greg
Knapp, Chuck Husting and Mike Her-
rin, anticipate that 300 dancers will
participate this year.

The dance will feature the live mu-
sic of the Convertibles, Red, Black
and Blue, The Suspects, Small Repu-
blic, and Green Eggs and Ham from
noon until 6 p.m. During the evening,
Waxing Poetics will play at 9 p.m.
and IBM at I! p.m. Dancers will soli-
cit pledges from individuals and or-
ganizations based on each hour dan-
ced.

Various prizes, including a grand

prize trip for two to Hilton Head for
eight days, will be awarded to the
dancers who receive the most pledges.

Spectators and those wishing to join
the marathon dancers are encouraged
to come to the Superdance. Admission
is $5 per person and is good for the en
tire event.

Further information about the
Superdance may be obtained by con-
tacting Fontanne Bostic at 463-8917.

Africanlmages step into another world

 

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

Walking into duPont Hall’s Images
of Africa exhibit is indeed a step into
another world. Woven blankets, car-
ved chairs, 18th century maps of the
Gold Coast of Africa and Ashanti
goldweights decorate the room.

The extensive collection belongs to
Fred L. Hadsel of Lexington, who
was a former U.S. ambassador to
Ghana. All the artifacts were either
collected by Hadsel or given to him by
various chiefs of tribes he visited
while living in Ghana.

Hadsel is currently on a tour of
Siberia, but will give a lecture about
his collection on Feb. 11 at 4 p.m. in
duPont Hall.

Each piece of the collection has a bit
of history written about it. The collec-

Pirandello drama to open
Friday at University Theatre

 

From Staff Reports

 

‘*Six Characters in Search of an Au-
thor,’ an early 20th- century play by
Luigi Pirandello, will be the next pre-
sentation by the University Theatre.
The play will run from Feb. 5 through
10, with performances at 8 p.m. each
day except Sunday, Feb. 7, which will
be a3 p.m. matinee performance.

This classic work has been referred
to as the first ‘‘modern’’ play, because
it deals with the exposure of theatrical
illusion and the puzzles of existence
and reality. It is often referred to in
discussions of existential and relativist
philosophy.

 

tion of Ashanti goldweights is exten-
sive. One particular weight was made
in the shape of Abraham Lincoin’s log
cabin to commemorate his birthday.
The American Embassy had a special
ceremony in honor of Lincoln’s birth-
day and the Ashantis acknowledged
his birthday with this small log cabin
goldweight.

Each household has its own set of
scales. Since the Ashantis never de-
veloped a smelting pot, each gold
piece had to be weighed individually.

Other tribes in Africa used clay
molds to form small statues from
metal. A repeated image is a bird fig-
ure with a long neck looking back-
ward. This is supposed to symbolize
that one doesn’t know where one is
going until one knows where One has
been.

Co-directed by Tom Ziegler and Al
Gordon, the play is set in a theatrical
rehearsal which is interrupted by the
instruction of six ‘‘characters’’ who
were created by an author but never
put into a finished work. When the
characters try to get the director and
actors to ‘‘create’’ their play, a debate
arises over the relative ‘‘reality’’ of
characters and actors. When he wrote
the play in 1921, Pirandello wanted
the audience to feel that, when they
entered the theatre, they had stumbled
into a rehearsal.

Reservations for ‘‘Six Characters in
Search of an Author’’ can be made by
calling the theatre office at 463-8637.

weaving of the cloth. The threads are
imported from Italy and the finished
cloth is used to make the traditional
Somali clothes, none of which are ex-

Post-18th century Ethiopian reli-

done by hand and the lettering resem-

psalms and hymns.

Other interesting artifacts include
incense burners, the smoke of which
Somali women use as their perfume.
Elaborately carved Ashanti stools are

Superdance ‘sucessful’

despite low turnout

 

By Wendy Wolford
Staff Reporter

 

Although participation was down
from last year, the Superdance for the
Muscular Dystrophy Association was
successful in raising $24,159 last Sat-
urday.

Co-chairmen Greg Knapp and
Chuck Husting, along with the mem-
bers of the Superdance Committee,
provided the music of the Waxing
Poetics and IBM from Atlanta for the
evening entertainment. The Battle of
the Bands held in the afternoon was a
well-received addition to the Super-
dance as well.

The contest consisted of five local
bands including Red, Black and Blue
and the Suspects, a law school band.

Green Eggs and Ham captured Ist
place, while Small Republic came in
second, followed by the Convertibles
in 3rd place. Not only did the local
bands show support for MDA but also
received exposure in the W&L com-
munity.

According to co-chairman Chuck
Husting, ‘‘the Battle of the Bands
made the Superdance this year.’” It
was a new idea that added a lot to the
event and attracted undergraduate and
law students as well as people from

Wilson travels

to England
for fall ’89

From Staff Reports

 

 

W&L President John D. Wilson
will spend the fall semester of the
1988-89 academic year at Oxford
University in England on an adminis-
trative leave that he was granted by
the university s board of trustees.

During Wilson’s absence, John W.
Elrod, vice-president for academic af-
fairs, will serve as acting president.

‘During the five years he has ser-
ved as Washington and Lee’s presi-
dent, John Wilson has devoted an
extraordinary amount of time and
energy to the institution,’” said James
M. Ballengee of Philadelphia, rector
of the board of trustees. ‘*We thought
that he deserved some time away from
the endless duties of the presidency in
order to reflect on the university and
its future as well as the future direc-
tion of American higher education.”

Although this is the first time that a
Washigton and Lee president has been
granted such a leave, Ballengee noted
that several colleges and universities
have given their chief executives such
opportunities in recent years.

Wilson’s plan for the leave are not
yet complete, but he does hope to
spend most of the tine at Exeter Col-
lege of England’s Oxford University

well.

During the Battle of the Bands, a
dance contest was held in which VMI
Cadet Craig Streeter won first place.
He was awarded a weekend for two at
the Hotel Roanoke. Several organiza-
tions were awarded for their efforts
also.

Kathekon won a season ski pass at
Massenutten for the most pledges do-
nated by an organization, while Phi
Delta Theta won a weekend for two at
the Williamsburg Hilton for the most
pledges from a fraternity.

Other dancers were awarded for
their efforts as well. Law student
Chris O’Brien won a week in Hilton
Head, South Carolina, for the most
overall pledges. Freshman Doug
Denby, who brought in the second
most pledges was awarded a weekend
for two at the Greenbriar Hotel.

Faculty sponsor Fontaine Bostic
was pleased with the Superdance in
general and feels it was truly a success
despite the decrease in participation
from last year.

The number of dancers was approx-
imately 60 less than last year and the
number of spectators decreased by
200. Also, tickets were only $5 this
year as opposed to $8 last year.

The city ordinance allowing up to

by Lexington City Council Thursday
night.

The dissenting vote was cast by
Councilwoman Sue LaRue, who co-

After presenting the ordinance to
the council, LaRue moved that the de-
finition of family be reduced from
four unrelated individuals to three in

The motion was not seconded and

The amnesty period in the approved
ordinance allow property owners until
June 30, 1990, to comply with the
new standards.

However, the stay of enforcement
on existing rental units does not deny
the city’s right to revoke the stay and
enforce the ordinance in response to
subsequent violations concerning sani-
tation, trash or other miscellaneous
offenses listed in the city’s code.

The approved ordinance also pro-
vides a conditional use provision al-
lowing up to eight unrelated indivi-
duals to live in a house as a single fam-
ily, if the property meets certain re-
quirements.

Those requirements include that the
house have at least one bedroom per
occupant, adequate off-street parking
and adhere to the Building Officials
and Code Administrators Existing
Structures Code.

In response to a citizen’s question,
Mayor Charles F. Phillips, said that

the responsibility of enforcing the new
ordinance would be in the hands of the
city building and zoning administra
tor.

Public and council discussion on the
ordinance was limited by Phillips,
who said that between council and the
Planning Commission the issue had
been completely discussed.

Councilman Larry Mann addressed
the importance and scope of the ordin-
ance. “By approving this ordinance
we are making a commitment to en-
force the other ordinances already on
the books,”’ he said.

Looking in retrospect on the family
definition issue which lasted some
three months, Councilman Mays said
that he was amazed at the unwilling-
ness of people to serve on committees
and commissions.

‘*We have a real problem,’’ Mays
said, ‘‘people are afraid that they will
be put in a position to be criticized.”

Mays said he believed council was
not taking full advantage of the
knowledge found in the Lexington
community.

Underground magazine
to surface after vaction

 

By Cheryl Bowles
Staff Reporter

 

An underground publication created
by W&L students will be distributed
throughout Lexington the week after
Washington Holiday, according to
Dave Daves, a third-year sophomore.

Daves described himself as being
responsible for selling advertisement
and getting the magazine published.

When asked what the publication is
called, Daves replied, ‘‘It’s a secret.”’

According to Daves, the magazine
has three sections: literature, arts, and
journalism.

The literature section in the first is-
sue will contain a play along with
short stories and poetry.

Daves said that the arts section
covers bands from Virginia and the
Washington, D.C. area as well as
bluegrass music.

The journalism section will contain
articles not just about W&L, but about
the Lexington community, said
Daves.

The first issue will contain an article
about ‘‘the so- called liberal arts
school that this is,” Daves explained,
among others.

The new publication has a staff of
more than 20 students, who work in
what Daves calls an open forum.
Anyone can submit material, and

anyone is welcome to heip edit the
magazine, he said.

W&L’s lack of a credible news-
paper is what Daves said prompted the
creation of the underground maga-
zine, so described because it receives
no financial help from the university.

According to Daves, W&L needs a
paper that focuses more on the com-
munity of Lexington, which he says is

‘*so much a part of this school.’’ The
support he has gotten from the com-
munity shows him, he said, that a lot
of other people feel the same way.

“‘Occasionally maybe we'll be fo-
cusing on some of the same issues as
the Ring-tum Phi,’ said Daves, ‘‘but I
hope with a lot more credibility.”’

Daves said that some of the articles
that have run in the Ring-tum Phi,
such as a story that rated the ‘‘best
buzz per buck,’’ for example, made
him say that the paper is not credible.

‘*The Talk-Back section is probably
the most popular section in the Ring-
tum Phi,’’ he added.

When asked about competition re-
sulting from the possible revival of the
humor magazine ‘‘Southern Colle-
gian’’, Daves replied that he does not
think it will be possible for that pub-
lication to come back.

“It [the Southern Collegian| would
be the hardest type of magazine to
come back with,’’ Daves speculated.
‘‘Good satire is the hardest thing to
write.””

W&L senior is suspended
for actions at Sweet Briar

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-Editor

 

Mare Gordon, a W&L senior, was
suspended for the rest of the 1987-88
academic year by the Student Conduct
Committee in its meeting Tuesday,
Feb. 2. The suspension, which is
effective immediately, is the result of
Gordon’s actions on Jan. 21 at Sweet
Briar College.

The decision was reviewed and
upheld by the Student Affairs Com-
mittee in its regular meeting Feb. 3,
according to Lewis John, Chairman of
the SAC. Gordon had not appealed the
SCC’s decision. The SAC regularly
reviews the cases heard before the
SCC.

The Student Affairs Committee can

aliitin the decisivn oi tie SCL, or ‘tue
pon the appeal of a student, it can re-
duce the penalty,”’ or, if it feels the
penalty is not harsh enough, it can
send the case back to the SCC for re-
consideration, said John.

Penalties for major offenses can be:
suspension for a specific period of
time, expulsion, or, if ‘‘there are un-
usual extenuating circumstances, then
some lesser penalty may be im-
posed, ”’ said John.

‘There is also a specific provision
that voluntary intoxication is not to be
considered an extenuating circum
stance,”’ said John.

Gordon declined comment on the
specifics of the case.

Gordon is eligible to apply for
readmission to the university for the
fall term of the 1988-89 academic
year.

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, February 11, 1988

 

Revise

At last Monday’s Executive Committee meeting there was a
meeting of applicants for the White Book Revisions. With about 17
students applying for 10-12 positions, it is obvious that interest has
risen since fall term, when plans for the committee had to be post-
poned because of a lack of applicants. Now that students have been
better informed about the committee and what it is intended to do.

The committee will review the White Book, which is the formal
structure for the Honor System, and submit changes the committee
are necessary, if any, to the EC for consideration as a revision. The
EC assured the applicants that the findings of the committee will
carry a heavy weight when the EC considers them.

The applicants were urged by junior representative Christopher
deMovellan to remember that the committee is not required to find
things to change in the White Book and not to be reluctant to submit
a report calling for no changes. A good piece of advice, since no
one wants an open season on the Honor System that could result in
radical changes in the Honor System in a short span of time.

However, we want to remind the committee, when it is formed
and begins meeting, that it also must not be afraid to criticize some-
thing in the White Book that may be flawed. Perfection is a wonder-
ful goal, especially in a system as idealistic as this on at W&L, but
not easily attained, if attainment is even possible. But pursuing per-
fection is something to be admired, and if changes in the White
Book will bring the system one step closer, then those changes need

to be considered.

We wish the revisions committee and the EC luck in its work. We
are confident that discussing the White Book in detail will shed val-
uable light on the Honor System, whether or not changes are made.

Date rape explained

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

In recent weeks I took readers to
the unadulterated frontiers of the fu-
ture with my ignorant predictions. In
this article I will take readers into the
exciting realm of the past, portraying
ignorance unsurpassed by any journa-
list since the French Revolution.

My first task is to choose a major
historical event. I could take you to
the front line of the most important
battle during the fourth century, the
Indonesian War for Canine Indepen-
dence —The Milkbone Retreat. I
could even take you to the flea-
infested headquarters of great military

Strategist and obedience champion

note: my dog is a direct descendent of
this Canine General) as he struggles
against the Pit Bull Corp’s demand for
more Kibbles and Bits. A few of these
insurgent Pit Bulls have even begun
barking Coup D’ Etat.

The only problem with the fourth
century Indonesian War for Canine
Independence is that no self-
respecting historians have written
books, journals and encyclopedias
about it. I want to take the reader
where no historian has even gone be-
fore.

Just because historians have not
written on the event, I just don’t as-
sume that it’s nota major historical
event. In fact, most Americans have
probably already heard of the soon-to-
be famous ‘‘Date Rape Bet’’ because
it was recently sent to Ann Landers in
the form of a letter that she published;
and let’s face it, America gets its in-
formation from Ann Landers, not The
Wall Street Journal.

Allow me to describe the letter. It
was written by an elderly gentleman
from Florida who claimed to be tired
of hearing statistics about date rape
because he had experimental evidence
that date rape is impossible. Here's

Generation changes university

 

MY VIEW

By Barney Robinson

and Buck Wiley

 

As members of the class of 1988
we've seen quite a few changes during
our time here at Washington and Lee.
In the September of 1984 we enrolled
in a small, competitive, all-male lib-
eral arts school. Washington and Lee
seemed the perfect place, a last bas-
tion if you will.

It soon became apparent that we had
entered a university under fire. The
faculty, administration, and the new
‘‘neutral’’ President were determined
to wreak massive change. The radical
acid generation of the 1960s has now
come of age. They are entering posi-
tions of power on college campuses
and are determined to implement their
leftist philosophy. To them, W&L
was an atrocious anachronism. It was
a target too tempting to resist. With a
methodical single-mindedness, they
proceeded resolutely to destroy the
character of our school, one that was
bequeathed us by Robert E. Lee.

Single sex was the first casualty.
After several failed attempts, coeduca-
tion was instituted. In a move to avert
school protest, the actual decision of
the trustees was postponed until July
when all the young ‘‘fascists’’ were
safely at home. Of course it was in our
“‘best interest’’, though. (Remember,
college age children don’t know
what's best for them.) Regardless of
the validity of their reasons, this was
round one in the fight to transform our
school.

Soon everything began to change.
Our beloved Cockpit became the
“General Headquarters.’’ On the
lighter side, even Coca- Cola was re-
moved from the Co-op (excuse us,
University Snack Bar). The new buzz
word of equality became a shroud for
the real policy of preferential treat-
ment for females. Fraternities came
under fire for their allegedly ‘‘disrup-
tive role’’ in our academic life, and
the IFC has seen its power destroyed
by a meddling faculty. The IFC has
become nothing but a facade that
projects the illusion of student self-
government. Will the student-run
Honor System be the next victim of
administration intervention?

The target of these changes was the
stereotypical W&L student. Preppy,
affluent, and conservative, he became
a wanted man. To the love children of
the 1960s, he respects all that they de-

spise. As in most educational institu-
tions, our faculty andi administration
are liberal. Once a faculty member
was overheard to say, *‘Their parents
have had 18 years to indoctrinate
them, I wish we had more than 4 to
undo the damage. *’

We foresee frightening years ahead.
Unless they conform to the Washing-
ton Hall's ‘‘ideal,’’ fraternities will
vanish from the scene. Washington
and Lee will have non-selective, coed
eating Clubs just like Davidson. Social
life will degenerate and we will see the
dissolution of one of W&L's greatest
strengths, the ability to promote matu-
rity by providing us with choices.

The school’s very name must be
offensive to the agenda- minded junta.
To them, General Washington must
be a dangerous militaristic figure, cer-
tainly not a good role model for young
gentlemen and ladies. In addition, Lee
may awake images of sectionalism
and racism to the uninformed. Might
the Board quietly ask the Lee family to
remove the cadavers from the chapel?
Then with much fanfare, they could
rededicate it as a shrine to sexual
equality. Subsequently, the Univer-
sity’s name would have to go. Perhaps
the powers that be will rename it after
some great paragon of liberation such
as Susan B. Anthony. That has a nice
ring to it, Susan B. Anthony Univer-
sity.

The Admissions Office people will
play a large role in this rape. A con-
certed attempt to recruit a more
“‘diverse’’ student body is already
under way. We're sure they would
love to purge future freshmen classes
of the ‘‘reactionary bourgeoisie’’ to
which so many of us belong—in their
eyes. What they want are ‘‘open min-
ded’” intellectuals, students with an
narrow desire for the single-minded —
pursuit of arid knowledge.

In these years of self-condemnation,
Washington Hall has forgotten that a —
real education is much broader than
the pursuit of knowledge alone. The .
forte of our once great University was
its ability to strengthen character. If a
student could succeed under the many
pressures and temptations of W&L, he
was assured of ease of assimilation
into the real world, a world that is not
a sheltered academic enclave.

Unfortunately, it may be too late to
stop the rot that is consuming our
school. Day by day, regulation by re-
gulation, the responsibility we were
once allowed is taken from us. Wash-
ington and Lee is becoming more di- ;
verse, yet at the expense of its es-
sence. The character of our school is
dying, and unless alumni and students
fight back its only legacy will be the
fond memories we cherish in our ~
minds.

To the editors:

As a senior looking back over my four years at
Washington and Lee, many found memories come
to mind. I’m sure that all of you will carry memor-
ies of W&L with you for the rest of your lives.
What I would like to do is describe a Washington
and Lee that many of you may not know—a Wash-
ington and Lee that existed four years ago. Sadly,
a school that perhaps only my fellow seniors and
W&L alumni might know.

As freshmen, we realized that we were now
making decisions on our own. It was a process of
trial and error. We realized the importance of
budgeting our time effectively. We knew that the
next four years would be a difficult road, involv-
ing much hard work and studying. We learned
when to stay in and study and when to go out and
party. All students here have a right to be proud of
their hard work. No one can argue with the fact
that Washington and Lee is one of the finest
schools in America. While at W&L, we have also
made many friends. All this remains the same.

Like many other Washington and Lee students,
I went through Rush as a freshman. It was a great
time, a time when I met new and different people.
I joined a fraternity and suddenly found myself a
member of a ‘‘pledge class’’—a group of students
who at first, had little in common. As our fresh-
man year progressed, we became closer. Our
friendships grew as we spent time together, both
inside and outside the classroom. In the process,
we matured.

Fraternities have long been an integral part of
W&L. Four years ago, fraternities were allowed
to serve various types of alcohol at their Rush par-
ties and regular parties. They were allowed to
have kegs on Wednesdays and on weekends,
when fraternities held open parties for all W&L
students to attend. These were times when stu-
dents could kick back and do what they wanted
with their friends. Students could be spontaneous
in deciding what to do. As all of you may sadly
know, all this has changed. No longer are we al-
lowed to have ‘‘hard’’ alcohol at any of our par-
ties. No longer are we allowed to have kegs on
Wednesdays and many of our parties have now
become B. Y.O.B. No longer are we allowed to
advertise our parties. The university has decided,
instead, that we must now personally hand out in-
vitations saying something like ‘‘I Joe W&L in-
vite you Mary Sweetbriar to our party this week-
end.””

What is our faculty thinking? Do they realize
that college is a learning experience, both aca-
demically and socially, an experience which hope-
fully leads us to a higher level of maturity. The
ability to make our own decisions is what separ-
ates high school from college. Some of our de-
cisions will be good and some will be bad. The
important thing is that in the process of making
decisions, we learn. The faculty of this university
has decided that we will be treated as adults in the
classroom but that in a social setting, that we will
be treated as children. No longer are we able to
act as individuals or be spontaneous. Students no
longer have the freedom they once had.

Last week, the faculty went a step further. They
took Rush away from the IFC. They also decided
that pledge activities will not begin until Winter
Term and that pledge programs can only last eight
weeks. Why did they do this?

It is apparent that they believe that fraternities
take too much time away from freshman aca-
demics. When you think about it, however, most
pledges spend at the most one or two hours per
week at their chapter house for meetings. Did the
university consider sports teams or extracurricu-
lar activities when they thought about freshmen?
No. Did the university say that all freshmen
couldn’t participate in any type of activity until
they established themselves academically? No.
After all, many sports teams practice up to three
hours per day. How often does an athlete come
home so tired after a practice, that he or she
doesn’t feel like doing’ homework? Why did the
university single out fraternities as being the sole
source of their ‘‘apparent’’ problem? If a fresh-
man cannot budget one hour out of his entire week
to spend at a fraternity, there is no way he is going
to be able to spend twenty to thirty hours per week
studying for his classes.

LETTE

With their decisions concerning parties, the
pledge program and Rush, the faculty of this uni-
versity has taken away one of the most important
aspects of ‘‘college:’’ the ability of students to
make decisions. If we can’t make our own de-
cisions, how will we ever become mature adults?
High school, not college, was the time to be led
around by the hand. We learn by trial and error
and for us, the time to learn is now.

I’m sorry to say, but I’m glad that I am graduat-
ing this year, because Washington and Lee is not
the same school it was four years ago. W&L was a
school that afforded us the opportunity to excel
academically and to make our own decisions.
Now we only have the academics. We no longer
enjoy the personal freedom we once did. It is un-
fortunate that our faculty, supposedly educated
and well-rounded individuals, fail to see thé’ im-
portance of having the freedom to make our own
decisions and in the process, to becomé more ma-
ture and responsible ‘‘individuals.”’

Bad decision

To the Editors:

I know you have heard from me many times
over the past four years, but the decision by the
‘*faculty’’ to leave the IFC out of the Rush
process until their ‘‘freshman year study’’ is com-
plete has forced me to write yet another letter.

When I found out at last week’s IFC meeting
the decision by the ‘‘faculty,’’ I sat back and
thought, now who is the ‘‘faculty’’ that is making
these decision about fraternities and fraternity
Rush. The only member of the faculty that has
spoken out for the faculty against fall fraternity
rush to my knowledge is Professor William Lad
Sessions and his faculty petition.

Now to me, fraternities and faculty members
are on two different levels of thinking about
fraternity Rush, but we should both be pressing
toward the same goal: improvement of the frater-
nity Rush process. The IFC should be involved in
the Rush process at W&L because they are logi-
cally the best informed. The faculty, on the other
hand, is the least informed because the majority of
them were not in fraternities at the universities
they attended and if they were it was in a totally
different time period. You might say that we as
the faculty gave complete control to the Student
Affairs Committee. Well that doesn’t help the si-
tuation out much either because that committee
consists of ten members. They are Dean John,
Dean Atkins, Professors Margand, Koberstein,
and Warren, the President of the Student Bar As-
sociation, the President of thé Student Body, the
President of the Senior Class, the Head Dorm
Counselor, and the President of the IFC.

The reason I listed the members of the SAC was
to point out realistically who is qualified to make
decisions about W&L fraternity Rush. First,
Professors Margand and Koberstein are both
women and for that fact alone are not qualified
because they don’t know what it is like being in a
fraternity. Even if they were in a sorority, frater-
nities are totally different. Next, comes the Presi-
dent of the Student Bar Association and the Head
Dorm Counselor. Both of these people don’t care
one way or the other about fraternities. Why? Be-
cause one is a law student and the other has been
out of the fraternity scene for two years as a dorm
counselor. This leaves us with Dean Atkins and
the President of the IFC as the most informed
about fraternities. The vote being 4 not qualified
to vote, 2 qualified to vote, and one faculty mem-
ber, Dean John, the President of the Student
Body, and the President of the Senior Class.

I have difficulties with the W&L fraternity
system being decided by people who aren’t a part
of it. I have along with the other 16 house presi-
dents and the members of the IFC busted my tail
making this past year’s Rush work, and we have
been slapped in the face by the faculty's decision.
W&L has run just fine through the years under

Student describes the lost Washington and Lee

student government, as a matter of fact we as a
university pride ourselves on it.

Instead of forming some study on the freshman
year committee, why don’t you make up a com-
mittee of House Corporation Presidents and
Fraternity Presidents along with SAC to decide
the fate of our beloved fraternities. These people
are informed! We have been working together on
the Fraternity Renaissance Plan and somebody
needs to realize this.

Sincerely,
Tommy McBride

Excellence is faster

Dear Editors:

In their recent best seller, The Search of Excel-
lence, Peters & Waterman listed a number of ac-
tions that contribute to the success of ad hoc task
forces in excellent companies. These include a
small number of volunteer individuals (10 or less)
pulled together rapidly when needed, with a very
limited duration (less than 4-6 months) as well as
other factors (see pg. 129-130).

If our university is to remain excellent, and if it
is truly on a quest for an excellent fraternity
system, the upcoming ad hoc study relating to ‘‘all
facets of the freshman year’’ should not be sched-
uled to be completed in the early 1990s as report-
ed in last week’s Phi, but rather in January of
1989. By spreading out a study such as this over a
period of years, students’ input & impact may
have little coherence or continuity as student
leaders graduate year after year.

Only through dedicated dialogue between
fraternity leaders and concerned faculty members
can these problems, such as Rush, be resolved to
mutual satisfaction and continued success both for
the University and its fraternity system. Set up a
committee, let it meet every two weeks in March,
April, Sept., Oct., Nov., & Dec. and report its
findings in January of 1989 and settle the issue. It
is in all of our interests if we are committed to
excellence in academics and the fraternity renais-
sance movement.

Sincerely,
William C. Datz

Gordon says good-bye

To my fellow students and friends:

I had hoped this letter was not going to be a
good-bye, but please take what I have to say to
heart.

On January 21 I headed down to Sweet Briar
with five fraternity brothers of mine. We drank a
lot and only had good times on our mind. After
drinking to extreme intoxication, my behavior be-
came so deplorable that I was escorted to my car
and drove home. I don’t remember most of the
evening and was in no condition to be on the road.
Upon returning to W&L, I was served a notice by
the Student Conduct Committee. There are accu-
sations to which I can not respond; I can not re-
member.

Based on all of the facts and testimony concern-
ing my actions, the Student Conduct Committee
voted me guilty of a major offense of student mis-
conduct and has decided to suspend me from the
University for the remainder of this academic
year. I truly respect the decision of our classmates
on this Committee.

When I give tours to prospective students, I ex-
plain that Washington and Lee is not a school for
everyone. I love it here. In the past I have learned
from my mistakes, I hope some of you can learn
from mine. It is an experience I would not wish on
any of you.

I’m proud to attend Washington and Lee, enjoy
being involved, and cherish all our friendships. I
wish the best to all of my classmates who will gra-
duate this spring. I look forward to seeing the rest
of you when I return to W&L next fall.

Bahamas
brunch
freezes
freshmen

 

By Stephanie Guittard
Staff Reporter

 

Last Sunday morning, students at-
tending brunch saw signs at Evans
Dining Hall directing them to the quad
at Graham-Lees. Waiting there was a
group of dorm counselors who had
been setting up for Bahamas in Febru-
ary.

“It’s like we got up at 5 o’clock this
morning to like set-up this Bahamas in
February motif,’’ said dorm coun-
selor Jim Cobb. He said they had been
setting up the volleyball and tables
without the freshmen knowing.

“It’s to get rid of those winter dol-
drums...to totally awesome irradicate
those bad vibes like coming through
the atmosphere, the cosmos, and we’-
re trying to like motivate and get rid of
these winter doldrums,’’ Cobb said.

Assistant Head Dorm Counselor
Jenny Bray thought of the idea, and
Dean of Freshman Ken Ruscio infor-
med the counselors a week prior to the
event.

“This is a great idea. The dorm
heads have been up since five this
morning doing all this, and so far
we ve been having probably more fun
than any of the freshmen,’’ said Cath-
erine Baillio.

Following the signs, the hungry and
thirsty freshmen students found tables
with fresh fruit, tropical mixers, hot
cocoa, Kudos and more.

The main complaint from
freshmen was it was too cold.

“‘T thought it was good, but it was
really cold out, so that took away from
it. The food was good, but I prefer the
stuff that they have at brunch. ..But, it
was neat, because it was different,”’
said freshman Lindsay Dehaven.

the

“‘T think is it had been on a warm
Saturday...people would’ve been
more into it,’’ said Dehaven. *‘I know
that the dorm counselors had been
working really hard.”’

 

 

 

 

 

Josh McDowell told W&L students ‘‘How to Have Maximum Sex’”’

By Hank Mayer/The Ring-tum Phi

Josh packs Lee Chapel;
preaches ‘Maximum Sex’

 

By Jon Ryan
Staff Reporter

 

Josh McDowell spoke Friday to a
full house in Lee Chapel about re-
lationships and sex.

‘We don’t have a sexual crisis to-
day, we have a relational crisis. A lot
of people are having sex today, but
very few are making love.”’

McDowell talked for an hour-and-a-
half on the topic of ‘Maximum Sex’’.
The speech was sponsored by the
Lamppost, the Fellowship of Chris-
tian Athletes, and the Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship.

According to McDowell in an inter-
view before the speech, joy and pas-
sion have gone out of sex.

‘*The key to sex is not the plumb-
ing, it’s the relational.

‘*T say many of the same things Dr.
Ruth does, but the main difference is I
put it in the context of relationship,
commitment and trust.

‘*There are three elements to sex.
There is the physical, the ‘soulish’ or
psychological, and the spiritual.

‘The physical is only about one-
twelfth of a total relationship.”

He spoke about the need for absti-
nence from sex before marriage from
a number of standpoints.

He cited the Bible as being against

class size to be cut by 25

In his Founders Day address, Presi-
dent Wilson announced the reduction
of the 1988-89 freshman class size
from 425 to 400 students.

Due to the high retention rate in the
past few years, the undergraduate po-
pulation as a whole must be controlled
to continue the’ small school tradition
that W&L is,recognized for, he said.

When the decision for coeducation
was made, the Board of Trustees set
the ideal undergraduate class at 1500.
They anticipated attaining their goal
by 1990 or 1991. However, the
growth occurred faster than expected,

and the current number of undergra-
duates is 1543.

Contributing to the large number of
undergraduates is low attrition rate. In
the past, the average rate was 2.5 to 3
percent, but recently it has decreased
to 1.5 percent. According to Registrar
Scott Dittman, students are not leav-
ing the school in as large numbers as
they used to. During the 1983-84
school year, W&L lost 6.4 percent of
the student body. However, only 2.8
percent left last year.

Dittman sees the increase in fifth-
year seniors as a contributing factor as
well. This year the number of candi-
dates for graduation decreased from
341 to 317 after fall term. With 20
more expected to be ineligible after
winter term, there will be approxi-

mately 40 fifth-year seniors returning
in the fall.

Frank Parsons, executive assistant
to the president, looks at the need to
control the undergraduate population
positively. He feels that it is a sign of
good-decision-making, but efforts
must be made to maintain the ideal
number in order to continue the qua-
lity of a W&L education.

Class size is one of the advantages
of a small school. If the number of
students increases, not only will the
flexibility of assigning rooms be re-
duced, but so will the time each
professor has to spend with his stu-
dents, said Parsons. According to Par-
sons, if the corrections are made now,
major changes in the university will be
prevented.

EC suggests SAB cut

 

By Jonathan Ryan
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee discussed
problems with the Student Activities
Board at their meeting Monday.

The EC also met with the applicants
for the White Book Revisions Com-
mittee.

The EC had a budget report from
the SAB, and went on to discuss the
services the board provides for stu-
dents.

The board is having a problem
drawing students to weekend concerts
in the Pavilion.

EC President Brad Root said, ‘‘Due
to the change in the drinking age, the

SAB needs to evaluate their philoso-
phy about entertainment, starting next
year.”’

Some of the EC members also said
they had received complaints about
SAB _ members-at-large, of which
there are 80-95, going to the front of
the line at the Cockpit on Wednesday
nights and getting in free.

They urged a reduction of the num-
ber of members-at-large in order to
limit the problem. They also asked the
SAB to re-think their policy of letting
members into functions free all term.

The EC talked briefly to the appli-
cants for the White Book Revisions
Committee.

They outlined the role of the com-
mittee, which would be to gather in-

pre-marital sex for people’s protec
tion, not to restrict their freedom.

He also spoke about pragmatic
reasons for abstinence.

“It’s [sex] becoming less casual.
It’s not for any moral reason what
soever. It’s for a pragmatic reason.
It’s for survival.

‘‘For the first time in history, you
have a sexually communicable disease
that’s 100 percent deadly.””

He cited statistics from a recent
FDA study conducted over a two year
period that showed a 17-30 percent
failure rate for condoms protecting
against AIDS.

**Your medical experts and others
will say the only safe sex is a mono-
gamous man with a monogamous
woman in a monogamous re-
lationship.”

He said that diseases such as AIDS
can stay dormant in the body for up to
15 years while they are being passed
on to others.

He also put the question of absti-
nence in terms of moral values and, as
he put it, character.

In referring to a talk Dr. Ruth gave
at the University of Cincinnati where
he quoted her as saying it was un-
reasonable to expect abstinence be-
cause the libido is too strong, he said,
‘‘we’re not talking about animal sex-
uality here, we're talking about hu-
man sexuality.

‘*We're talking about people who

have the capacity to make moral de
cisions and abide by them.”’

On the question of character, h
said that students 20 years ago didn’
have as much sexual involvement a
we do today.

**What they [Dr. Ruth and Planne:
Parenthood] are saying by saying th
libido is too strong is that students 2(
years ago had more character, mor
capacity to control their lives than stu
dents do today.’’

From Staff Reports

 

While the recent stock market
plunges have forced many financial
planners to reexamine their portfo-
lios, students at W&L are still en-
joying a healthy return from what
was once the largest gift ever to
American higher education.

In 1796 George Washington
gave Liberty Hall Academy a gift

 

at $50,000. At the time it was the
largest gift ever to American
higher education. The school
changed its name to Washington
Academy in recognition of the gift,
which has been part of the univer-

 

of James River Canal stock valued ,

Washington gives
each student $3.48

sity’s endowment ever since.

This year, income from the gift
is paying $3.48 toward the cost of
education for each of the 1,896
students at W&L.

Over the decades, Washington’s
birthday was observed at W&L by
the suspension of classes. More re
cently, the date usually falls within
a week-long midwinter break in the
undergraduate calendar, aptly
named the Washington Holiday.

Whether they happen to be en-

.doying, the Florida, beaches or the

Peer Counselors help the LHS Peer Helpers

 

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

 

Some of W&L’s Peer Counselors
met with Lexington High School's
Peer Helpers Wednesday afternoon to
discuss how LHS might improve their
program.

The two-year-old LHS program is
under the direction of two LHS gui-
dance counselors, Carol Phemister
and Deborah Pruett. Phemister
said the goal of the LHS Peer Helpers
is to reach out toward kids at LHS.
The seven-member group was inter-
ested in W&L’'s program to see how
they might improve their own. More
exactly, the LHS Peer Helpers were
interested in how W&L trained their
peer counselors.

program wanted to provide the oppor-
tunity for students to talk with other
students about problems, or ask ques-
tions that they would feel uncomforta-
ble talking about with a trained psy-
chologist or counselor. In this way,
the student would be more at ease.

Walker said that the peer counselors
try to meet every two weeks to discuss
various topics such as date rape, prob-
lem solving, alcohol awareness and
AIDS. Walker said Worth teach many
of the information-oriented Peer
Counselor sessions, but other indivi-
duals have spoken to the group as
well.

Another junior, David Bloods-
worth, said an important part of the
peer counselor training was an exer-
cise designed to improve listening
skills.

Bloodsworth said that in the listen-
ing skills session, each of the peer
counselors shared a problem, and the
other peer counselors responded to
that problem. Besides working on
their listening skills, peer counselors

concentrated on picking up emotions.
Bloodsworth said it helped to develop
trusting relationships among peer
counselors.

“If people can’t trust you,”
Bloodsworth said, ‘‘they won't tell
you about their problem, and then you
are not being effective as a peer coun-
selor.”*

As a peer counselor, one must
‘bring a person out to talk about their
problem,"’ said John Legters, a W&L
junior. However, Legters said, the in-
dividual must take the first step.

Bloodsworth agreed, saying, ‘‘Peo-
ple won't come to you and say ‘I have
a problem and I need to talk to you as
a peer counselor’. They come to you
in a casual, protective way. Some-
times you yourself may not even real-
ize at first that they’re signaling you
for help or advice.”’

‘*We’re not trying to be profession-
als,’’ said Walker, ‘‘but we are there
if people need someone to talk to.”’

In the meeting, the W&L Peer
Counselors answered questions from
the LHS group and made suggestions.
Both groups had similar problems in

starting out, such as getting people to
utilize their group.

Once some did, they had to learn
how to bring people around to talking
about their problems, but not become
involved themselves in the person's
problem. :

Several of the LHS Peer Helpers
were frustrated that people weren't
utilizing their group and asked how
they could **bring people around.”’

Phemister said the Peer Helpers had
a Breakfast Club where students could
come and meet them and talk if they
chose. LHS also had a peer helper
column in their school newspaper that
provided more anonymity for those
students who were afraid to confront a
peer helper.

Phemister said the group had tried
various things to bring about more in-
dividual student contact, but had not
had much response.

Legters said that the LHS title,
‘*Peer Helper’’, sounds intimidating
to people and suggests they have a
weakness, thus delaying them from
seeking help. Legters suggested the
LHS group might want to find another

In his study of the Watergate af-

on the president’s ‘‘violation of the

Hoops beats Emory

It was senior’s night at the Warner
Center on Saturday, and it couldn't
have come at a more opportune time
for the W&L basketball team.

After an extremely frustrating 89-80
Old Dominion Athletic Conference

night, the Generals seemed to be on
the edge, ready to topple over. The

The Generals needed a big lift emo-
tionally, so they turned to their four
seniors.

Playing their final regular season
game at the Warner Center, the
seniors—guard Steve Hancock, for-
ward Gary Schott and centers Lou
Trosch and Harmon Har-
den—responded by leading W&L to a
92-80 win over Emory University.

Hollins

" Staff Reporter

 

The W&L women’s swim team won
against Hollins 91-61 last Saturday at

» Cy Twombly Pool. Spectators would

'+ Head

have considered the meet to be an im-
pressive showing for the Generals.
coach Page Remillard,
however, was a little disappointed
with the women’s effort.

‘We were certainly under control,

, but I felt that a few swimmers didn’t

push as hard as they could have,”’ he
said. ‘I’m discouraged because I feel
as if the team missed an opportunity to
test itself.””

W&L won the 400-yard medley re-
lay and then five swimmers went on
individually to capture six winning
times. The outstanding performances
were: juniors Nancy Whalen and Eli-
zabeth Miles in the 100-yard and
200-yard  freestlyes respectively;
sophomore Debbie Grove’'in’ the
200-yard individual medley; freshman
Kristin Wagnef in the 1000-yard
freestyle; and freshman Sharon Cole-
man in both the 50-yard freestyle and

“I think the thing that was good
about the game was that we got some
“senior leadership,’’’ said Canfield.
“IT said to Steve{ Hancock] before the
ballgame, ‘I need something extra,
something special from you.’"’

Extra special indeed. All Hancock
did was go out and score a career-high
33 points on 11 for 17 shooting (4 of 5
from three-point distance) and dish
out seven assists. Harden, not to be
outdone, netted his career high with
27 points and grabbed 10 rebounds.
Trosch scored only eight points, but,
more importantly, snagged eight
boards. Schott, although he did not
score, had three assists and did all the
little things that help teams win.

The Generals were up by as much as
12 points with less than ten minutes to
go in the second half, but Emory
clawed back behind the 33 points of
Tim Garrett. W&L kept its composure
and then iced the game from the
free-throw line down the stretch.

The free-throw line played a large
part in the Emory and Henry game on

Thursday. W&L led the Wasps by
nine until the officials, who had let a
lot of physical play go on in the first
half, decided to test out their whistles.
In 33 seconds, E&H would go to the
line 10 times and the General's lead
had vanished. For the entire game, the
Wasps shot 40 free throws—making
32 of them—to W&L’s 16.

In his final game for W&L, Klump
added 22 points but also drew a tech-
nical foul, It was the second time in as
many games that the junior guard has
irritated the officials enough to be
nailed with a ‘*‘T.”’ After the game,
Klump and Canfield had a conference
during which Klump decided to quit
the team. Freshman guard Mike Hol-
ton started in place of Klump in the
Emory game.

The General's overall record now
stands at 16-5, 7-4 in the ODAC.
W&L plays at Mary Washington to-
night before taking on three tough
conference foes—Roanoke, Eastern
Mennonite and Maryville—all of
which will be played on the road.

Slow times were the main cause be-
hind the W&L men’s swim team’s
118-98 loss to William and Mary last
Saturday at Cy Twombly Pool.

Head coach Page Remillard was not
pleased: ‘‘Even when we won an
event, we didn’t swim as fast as we
could have.”’

The Generals were also hurt by the
performance of their divers. W&L’s
diving program has been in dire need
of people all season, and, against
W&M, that Achilles’ heel was ex-

Sophomore David Olson wins the 200-yard backstroke in Satur- posed badly. The Tribe outscored the

day’s meet.

Remillard did not ignore the team’s
victory. ‘‘It’s a coach’s job to recog-
nize success, but also to make the ath-
letes keep striving. This meet was not
a problem and the lack of effort was
atypical. It’s nice to compete without
a great amount of pressure, but what
about when we face Sweet Briar in the
[Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence|championship?’”~

A more immediate challenge is the
meet against Mary Washington this

close race.

‘‘Mary Washington is considered
the co-favorite choice to win the
championship. We have to have a per-
fect meet to outswim them.”’

In order to win against Mary Wash-
ington, the Generals have to be
thoroughly prepared.‘ ~~

‘‘In tough meets, if the opposing
team makes a mistake, we want to be
in a position to capitalize on it,’’ said

Generals 27-6 in the one- and three-
meter springboard events.

But W&L, according to Remillard,
was still in a position to win the meet,
despite its diving. The Generals won
the 400-yard medley relay in 3:40.94
and, after wins by sophomores Adam
Morgan in the 1000-yard freestyle
(10:10.58) and David Olson in the
200- yard individual medley, W&L
had opened up a 47-36 advantage.

Senior guard Steve Hancock drives to the basket against Emory
and Henry. Hancock scored 60 points in W&L’s last two games.

4 Diving, slow times

result in loss to W&M

Tribe kept its momentum in the next
event—the 200-yard butterfly—by
placing first and second and grabbed
the lead, 62-55, for the first time all
afternoon.

The deficit was cut to 78-73 after
Olson garnered his second win of the
meet in the 200-yard backstroke. The
comeback was shortlived as W&M
outscored the Generals in the
500-yard freestyle 10-7 and the three-
meter diving 13-3.

At that point, the scoreboard read
101 for W&M and only 83 for W&L.
Sophomore Shawn Copeland stopped
the bleeding by winning the 200-yard
breaststroke in 2:18.21 and was hel-
ped by senior Simon Perez, who came
in second with a time of 2:21.49.

Unfortunately, it was too little too
late as the Generals trailed by 13
points, 107-94, going into the final
event of the meet—the 400-yard frees-
tyle relay. The Tribe wouldn’t even
allow W&L the opportunity to make
the final score closer, taking first,
third and fifth in the relay and ending
-a-day of frustration for the Generals.

W&L will travel with the women’s
team this weekend to Fredericksburg
where the Generals will swim against
Mary Washington College.

The W&L wrestling team lost last
night 36-8 to Longwood College.

The Generals were only able to win
two matches as Longwood routed
W&L in the dual match.

The wrestling team split its two
matches at the Washington and Jeffer-
son Triangular Saturday, bringing its
record to 3-8.

The Generals blew out Gallaudet
45-10, thanks greatly to five forfeit
wins that gave them 30 points without
having to contest a match. Head coach
Gary Franke explained that Gallaudet
was banged up at this point of the
season and lacked the wrestlers to fill
in.

W&L received pins from freshman
Vince Allen at 150 pounds, and junior
Manoli Loupassi at 190 pounds.
Senior Steve Castle won by decision at
126 pounds.

Against host Washington and Jef-
ferson, the Generals moved out to a
9-0 lead after freshman Larry Pilkey
won by decision at 118 pounds and
Castle continued his winning ways
with a third period pin.

However, the Presidents would
dominate the rest of the match, shut-
ting out the Generals in the final eight
weight classes to win 38-9.

‘I was disappointed with the way
we wrestled from 134 [pounds]to hea-
vyweight,”’ said Franke, adding that it
was just one of those days.

The Generals suffered more than
just the loss to W&J. Junior Mark
Robertson injured his knee and will be
out for the year. Robertson (6-3-1 for
the season) had just recently re-
covered from an injury to his other
knee and had been wrestling well
since he rejoined the Generals’ lineup.

W&L will send five wrestlers to the
Eastern Regionals, which will be held
Feb. 19-20 at New York University.

We can't live in the Glory Days Forever

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

We at Washington and Lee have a
problem that must be addressed and
with Fancy Dress just around the
proverbial corner it seems as though
now is a good time to address it.

Unless you have been living in a
vacuum for the last five months, you
know that the attendance for ‘*Wed-
nesday Night Bands in the Pit’’ has
been way down compared with that of
years past. While there are a hundred
explanations as to why, you can bet
the ranch and the dog (as Mike Shady
would say) that people are not going to
the Wednesday night performances
because the Pit can’t sell alcohol to
anyone under 21. Well, wake the chil-
dren and call the neighbors, isn’t that
a huge surprise.

Unfortunately for us there is some-
thing called the Law of Virginia that
says we cannot buy any alcoholic
beverage unless we are 21 years old.
If I am the first person to tell you that,
| apologize for ruining your day. In all
seriousness, it is the law and it is
something that we are going to have to
live with until it is ever changed

Your very own Guide

 

By Tina Vandersteel
Cruise Director

 

Standing amidst a crowd of people
advancing steadily their state of hap-
piness at any recent party, I’ve noticed
that as vacation draws near and buz-
zed conversation turns to plans for
break many people have been reply-
ing, ““Cancun.”’ At the risk of trying
to pass myself off as an authority on a
subject, | offer here my guide: How to
Survive in Cancun.

This comes from one solid week of
field research done over Christmas
break and includes data compiled
from painstaking research methods, as
you all can well imagine. The follow-
ing are some DO’s and DON’Ts that
may prove helpful for those with Can-
cun in their plans. For those who
don’t, [ invite you at this time to move
onto the next article.

The Exchange Rate

DO find out what the official rate is

(which will probably be never).

Whether becoming or not, Drinking
and the ability to throw outrageous
parties has been part of the Washing-
ton and Lee legend since before there
was dirt. However, the days of daily
drunken revelry are over. That's
right, I said those days are over. We
are no longer the number one party
school in the nation a la Playboy
magazine, nor do we consume more
alcohol per person than any campus in
the country. Again I’m sorry to those
of you that are receiving this news for
the first time. I know that there are
some of you who are going to go out
and single handedly try to prove me
wrong tonight. Bravo, My congratula-
tions to you. The fact remains,
however, that we have to deal with not
being able to drink at our school-spon-
sored social events.

Fact: the Pit can no longer sell alco-
hol to anyone under 21.

General Headquarters manager Bill
Torrence said that there is no question
that the raising of the drinking age is
the reason why people are no longer
going to the Pit on Wednesday nights
to hear the bands. Every week, the Pit
gauges the success of Wednesday

in the Wall Street Journal before you
go.

DON’T exchange money at your
hotel; they charge you a fee there.
Exchange money at the airport or at
the banks.

Transportation

DON’T rent a car for the tellowing
reasons:

1. Taxis are cheaper.

2. The Policia extract high—shall
we say—‘‘fees’’ for driving offenses
if you don’t wish to be arrested, and
they’re always on the lookout with
their machine guns.

3. Gas is only available in one loca-
tion in all of Cancun and is very ex-
pensive.

DO negotiate your taxi fee before
you go anywhere. First, tell them
where you want to go, ask how much,
and start by offering them half of what
they quote. If they don’t like it, walk
away; there are many taxis in Cancun.

DON’T pay more than $3 to go

night on the amount of beer sold that
night. For the Pit to break even on
Wednesday night they must make
$310 in sales. As of last week, the
average take on Wednesday nights
was $330. Any C-school major that
wants to stay in business will tell you
that a $20 net isn’t going to get you
very far. Granted, some nights are
better or worse than others, but the
fact remains that extinction of Wed-
nesday night concerts in the Pit is im-
minent. This year’s projection of
Wednesday night beer sales is $8,800.
During the 1983-84 year, the beer
sales were $55,000. Pretty simple
math, you figure it out.

Fact: all concerts at the Pavilion this
year have been dry and in all prob-
ability will stay that way.

Just as the Pit is forced to live or die
by the ‘21 Age”’ drinking laws, so is
the Student Activities Board. Concerts
at the Pavilion this year have been dry
because for legal and risk manage-
ment purposes it is not possible to
have a communal source of alcohol,
that is, one of which anyone and their
brother can partake. I can’t count the
number of people that I have heard say
since before the Homecoming concert

anywhere (even Cancun City) unless
it’s the airport, and then $7 is ou-
trageous.

Shopping

DON’T buy anything silver unless
it’s stamped with the government
symbol and the number .925. In the
stores pay no more than $1 per gram
for silver, although the back alley
markets will give you a better price.

DON’T pay attention to the sob
stories of the merchants in the mar-
ketplace. Their only legitimate pitch
is: ‘‘Hey—hey—FRIEND by the way,
every merchant is your ‘friend’
there—come here and give me a
chance to rip you off.’’ (They really
say that).

Tourism

DON’T do any of the tours of the
ruins, like Tuluum, unless your really
into ruins.

DO go to Isla Mujeres and/or Co-
zumel if you really like scuba.

Now that you've saved all the

‘*There’s no Beer? Well then I’m not
going.’ I think it’s a pretty sad state
of affairs when people are not going to
concerts and social functions because
they can’t get drunk. Are we that al-
coholic that we can’t have a good time
unless we are drinking? Maybe so.

At this point I also want to address
the situation surrounding the bands we
have been having. While we are an ex-
tremely prestigious University, we are
not, as I’m sure you are all aware, a
large one. We have, by choice, a
small student body but consequently a
proportionate amount of money be-
cause of it. The SAB had at the begin-
ning of the year $40,000 to spend on
our social activities for the year. The
object is for them to spend our money
throughout the year without coming to
the end with nothing left. The problem
is that the SAB is working on a
double-edged sword. If they spend
$10,000 on a band, and the ticket sales
equal $8,000 then they still have
$32,000 to spend on us. Comprende?
However, if they spend $17,000 on a
band and ticket sales are $4,000 be-
cause nobody goes to the concert (no
Homecoming concerts mentioned)
most likely because they can’t drink,

then they only have $27,000 left to
spend. Got it?

The bottom line is that Lexington is
not a major draw for the Grateful
Dead, U2, or the Screaming Blue Vir-
gins from the Poisoned Church of
Slippery Rock. The SAB works as
hard as they can to get the best bands
possible but we don’t have the funds
necessary to fly in a band from Los
Angeles or New York for just one
night. If they are not somewhere in the
area, i.e. on the East Coast or nearby,
then it takes major capital to get them
to play. You as the student body can
help the situation though. As I said, if
attendance at the concerts is good and
the SAB can deposit money back into
the fund, then we can get better bands.
If the spring concert arrives and the
SAB still has $25,000 sitting in a sav-
ings account drawing interest you can
bet that we will have one hell of a con-
cert.

This article was not designed to be a
gripe session. As the entertainment
representative for the paper, I wanted
you to know what kind of boat you are
floating in. Instead of complaining
about the horrible bands that you re-
fuse to go see, and the fact that you

can’t drink at the concerts (something :

I would again like to add is something

the SAB has no control over) why not *

just suck it up and go anyway. You
will probably have a good time in spite
of yourself. Not to mention that you
are putting money back into your ac
count so that when the spring rolls
around and you want Jimmy Buffet to
come play, we have the money to
make him a serious offer.

I hope this article hasn't offended ‘

anyone, but if it has, rough stuff. This
is a subject that has been kicked

around long enough and one that *

needs to be addressed. Being totally
serious, if you as the student body do

not want Wednesday night bands in ‘

the Pit, then tell the SAB about it.
Write them a letter. It's foolish to
waste money that could be spent on
larger concerts if you don’t want
Wednesday night bands. If you have
suggestions about alternative forms of
entertainment or events that would
please a greater portion of the student
body, then tell them. They work hard,
but their not omniscient. Tell them
how you feel. It’s the only way they

are ever going to know what you ‘

want.

that money on:

Drinking

DO drink before you go to any bar.
Catch a buzz in advance— at $3.00/ 6
of Corona and $2.75/ 6 of Dos Equis,
it is worth it!

DO conceal your drinks on the
beach if they were not purchased at
your hotel. If the hotel doesn’t bother
you about it, the policia will. Sugges-
tion: bury the bottles in the sand with
some ice.

DON’T use the mini bars if they’re
provided in your hotel rooms, as
tempting as it may be. They’ll kill you
with the bill afterwards.

Spurgeon shines in W&L Drama

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

The new adaption of Luigi Pirandel-
lo’s play Six Characters in Search of
an Author written by Washington and
Lee drama professor Tom Ziegler
opened to a full house Friday night at
Henry Street’s Troubadour Theater.

According to the adaption notes in
the program, ‘‘Six Characters in
Search of an Author has the reputation
of being the first ‘experimental’
play.’ If indeed Friday night was an
experiment, then the result was suc-
cess.

The drama opens with five actors
dragging in late to a rehersal of Che-
kov’s Three Sisters against the bark of
an insistent and edgy state manager.
Part of the experimental nature of the
drama is that the audience is supposed
to feel as though they have stumbled
in on a rehersal in progress which is
exactly what it felt like.

The characters stretch, and yawn,
and mill around until the director

comes storming in wanting to know
why practice hasn’t started. For the
next thirty minutes or so the charac-
ters treat the audience to a light, comi-
cal look at the difficulties of rehersing
a play. Then, it happens.

Midway through the first act, the
lights drop down to almost nothing
and in what appears to be a mirrored
back wall of the studio appear six sul-
len figures in black that look like a
cross between the Addams Family and
the Dollanganger Family from V.C.
Andrews Flowers in the Attic series.

Following the screams of the au-
dience, the lights go out for a few sec-
onds and when they come back up, the
six figures are standing in the middle
of the stage. The father of the family
informs everyone that they are six
characters who were developed but
never published. Thus, they travel
around searching for a place to act out
their drama.

Yes, the premise is strange but in an
abstract sort of way has quite a lot to
say. The ‘‘six characters’” make intri-

guing statements about the nature of

acting and actors such as ‘‘No matter

how hard you try to act, you can never

actor is reality for the character.”’

As usual, Washington and Lee
drama veterans Susan Crouse and
Craig Smith gave fine performances
as the stepdaughter and Clay while
newcomers Genienne Mongno, Stacy
Morrison, and Tom Rawls delighted
the audience with their eccentric
roles. The entire production was well
done, but the excellence of two speci-
fic things stood apart from the rest.

The show’s playbill says that
freshman Tom Spurgeon made _ his
stage debut in Six Characters because
he lost a bet and had to try out for a
part in the production. If that’s truly
the case,
won the bet.

Spurgeon’s haunting performance
as the father was absolutely superb.
While his presence on stage was
commanding, it was nothing com-
pared to his booming voice that took
control and held everyone in the
theater suspended. Morrison agreed
saying that ‘‘if a line was skipped or
something was missed, Tom would

he needs to thank whoever™

cover for whoever needed it.’’ Spur-
geon may have been on the stage last
week as the result of a lost bet, but if
Six Characters is his last production,
he is making a serious mistake.

The other outstanding feature of Six
Characters is something that usually
goes unnoticed and unpraised.
However. in this show, there is no
question that the lighting and special
effects were what made everything
flow as smoothly as it did.

Sophomore Mary Hipp and the
members of the lighting crew did a
phenomenal job in putting together a
light show that created a realistic aura
around a not-so-realistic story line.
The two way mirrored wall, the flash-
ing signal lights, and the creation of a
garden through the use of lighting at
the end of the drama were plain and
simply done as effectively as they
could have been done.

Six Characters in Search of an Au-
thor was one of the oddest dramas to
be performed at W&L lately, but in-
deed, it was one of the best. If you
missed it, you missed out on a real
treat.

Two W&L students are putting
together a panel discussion group
to discuss current and controversial
issues.

Saying that Contact is not pro-
viding enough opportunities to en-
rich student’s knowledge of cur-
rent events, and that it does not
offer enough interaction, John
Falk, ’90 law, and Bob Tompkins,
*89, are forming the group.

The panel discussions will in-
volve faculty and students from
both the law and undergraduate
schools.

The group’s format will be a
short presentation from each of the
five or six panel members of their
opinions. A moderator will run the
discussion, with the audience free
to pose questions and express opin-
ions.

Said John Falk, ‘‘The real pur-

pose is to encourage active debate
on substantive issues. ”’

The debates will try to give the
students both sides of the issue.

 

 

Students to form
discussion group

Panel members will be selected for
their opposing points of view.

One of the benefits of the group
would be its flexible format. Ac-
cording to Falk, it would be able to
meet in any of the various auditor-
iums or lecture halls, depending on
demand. And, according to Tomp-
kins, it would be virtually free.

““We don’t plan to bring in
anyone with large honorariums.
We can do it all in-house. ”’

The two plan to organize ‘‘con-
sistent and continual forums’’ on
current and controversial issues.

They are currently planning a
contra aid panel for early March,
with Professors Herrick, Parker, a
legislative assistant for Senator
McKane (R., Ariz.), and Professor
Geimer from the Law School.

An exact date for the event has
not been set yet.

According to Tompkins, ‘‘We
have talked to the politics depart-
ment, the journalism department,
the faculty, and members of the
administration. We have a good
base of support. Our primary task
now is the generation of student in-
terest.”’

Ladies and Gentlemen of Washing
ton and Lee, welcome to the Recon-
ciliation Ball of 1865; the 81st annual
Fancy Dress Ball.

Since the origin of our little get-
together in 1907, Fancy Dress has
grown into what has been called ‘‘the
largest collegiate social event in the
nation.’’ This year will be no excep-
tion.

The festivities will officially kick-
off Wednesday night at 9 p.m. when
the MTV-renowned Boneshakers
come to Lexington to rock the General
Headquarters.

Thursday night offers a triple con-
cert at the Student Activities Pavilion
with three bands from the Progressive
Music breeding ground of the
South—Athens, Georgia. Pinocchio
Nose, Drivin’ & Cryin’, and Love
Tractor will start up about 8 p.m. and
promise to put on a long and exciting
show.

Wednesday and Thursday nights are
fun, but Friday night is enchanting.
The Fancy Dress Ball—a night of an-
ticipation, expectation and realization
of hopes, dreams and fantasies; a
night of unique memories for anyone
who experiences it.

As you and your date approach the
red-carpeted stairs leading to the
Warner Center entrance to the past, a

Election petitions due

 

By Jon Ryan
Staff Reporter

 

Elections for Executive Committee
offices are just around the corner.

Petitions for the ‘‘Big Three’’ of-
fices—president, vice- president, and
secretary—were available Tuesday in
Carol Calkins offie. Candidates need
150 signatures by Monday.

The elections for the ‘*Big Three’’
will be held March 7, with the run-
offs on March 10.

The EC decided to allow short spee-
ches from each candidate as well as

requiring answers to set questions dur-
ing the open forum for candidates in
Lee Chapel on March |.

Elections for undergraduate rep-
resentatives and class officers will be
held Monday, March 21. Law school
election dates are still to be announ-
ced,

In other EC news, the EC froze the
accounts of two clubs.

The funds of the Fencing and
Squash clubs were frozen after no rep-
resentatives from the clubs appeared
at a budget review hearing. The EC
voted to hold their money until they
met with club representatives.

lining the stairs will introduce you to
the Reconciliation Ball. Inside the
doorway a buggy in front of a back-
ground of newspaper front pages and
blown-up posters from the Civil War
will meet you.

The Warner Center, decorated like
the Southern countryside on one side
and Northern city on the other, will
act as an elegant ballroom while the
sounds of the Glenn Miller Orchestra
sweep the almost four thousand people
expected for Fancy Dress off of their
feet. The Orchestra’s repertoire con-
tains over 1700 songs, and it promises
to be a wonderful evening of musical
enchantment.

The wall behind the Orchestra will
be covered with gray paper with a
blue border and will showcase the 36
state flags from the states in existence
in 1865. On the opposite wall, where
the stairs lead up to the 500-level of
the Warner Center there will be a two-
story mansion complete with columns
and trees covered with Spanish moss.

While the Glenn Miller Orchestra
swings in the Warner Center, Dore-
mus Gymnasium will be doing some
rocking of its own.

The Doremus Gymnasium will be
decorated like a Paddlewheel river-
boat with the paddlewheel coming out
of the wall by the athletic administra-
tive offices. On the other side of the
gym, Indecision will start cranking
out some serious rock and roll some-
time after 9 p.m. After they have
warmed up the stage sufficiently,
Marshall Crenshaw, the headline rock
act for the Reconciliation Ball of
1865, will hit the stage.

 

This year’s ball promises to be on
of the best Fancy Dress Ball's in re
cent memory. A small fireworks dis
play will open the ball, and then a
much larger one will conclude the ball
sometime after | a.m.. The fireworks
are not the only revival,
This year’s invitation will specify the
dress as Black Tie or appropriate cos
tume.

however

One of the most appealing things
about the Reconciliation Ball of 1865
theme was the potential of bringing
back costumes. The earliest Fancy
Dress Balls were all costume parties,
and later, costume balls. With this
year’s theme, the SAB not only wan
ted to emphasize the tradition of
Washington and Lee and the signifi
cance the Civil War played on shaping
our university, but they also wanted to
bring back one of our oldest tra
ditions: costumes at Fancy Dress

There have been some questions
about the nature of the theme from the
administration and there may be some
from the Student Body, but the SAB
urges everyone to keep in mind that
Fancy Dress is a social event, not a
political one.

The SAB has put in over a thousand
hours in preparation for this year’s
Fancy Dress and more than anything
wants everyone who goes to have a
happy, safe and memorable Fancy

. Dress.

Ladies and Gentlemen of Washing
ton and Lee, I present to you, the 81st
annual Fancy Dress Ball; The Recon
ciliation Ball of 1865. To the ballroom
we go.

Mock Convention comes close in primaries;
correctly predicts Gephardt and Dukakis

 

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

Washington and Lee’s Mock De-
mocratic Convention correctly predic-
ted the three front-runners in the lowa
caucus, although in a slightly different
order.

The results of the Feb. 8 Iowa cau-
cus put Rep. Richard Gephardt
(D-Mo.) and Sen. Paul Simon (D-III.)
in a close race for the lead, with Mas-
sachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
close behind.

According to the Washington Post,

Law students not banned from Gaines Hall

 

By Jon Ryan
Staff Reporter

 

‘*Law students banned from Gaines
Hall’’ was the front page headline of
the Feb. 11 issue of the W&L Law
News.

A misunderstanding apparently oc-
curred between Washington Hall and
the Law School regarding the adminis-
tration’s housing policy on Gaines
Hall as it applies to law students.

According to Dean of Students
Lewis John, housing applications
were sent to the law school and the
administration never heard back, so
they assumed no law students wanted
to live in Gaines.

According to EC Representative
David Nave, the housing applications
sat on the circulation desk in the law
school until near deadline, when peo-
ple started asking about them.

Assistant Dean Kenneth Ruscio said
residents of Gaines Hall, including the
law students there, will get first choice
of staying there.

John said that he knew of only two
law students who re- applied to live in
Gaines, and no new applications.

‘*The only people we wrote to were
current residents of Gaines,”’ said
John.

Ruscio said he would like to hear
what the housing wants of law stu
dents are.

**T wouldn’t want to use law stu
dents in a way they don’t want to be
used,’’ although he would like to use
housing to help close the gap between
law students and undergraduates.

John said he had the feeling that law
students wanted to live by themselves
for a variety of reasons, citing
different interests and undergraduate
noise as two of the factors.

Next year the East building of
Woods Creek will be exclusively law
housing. The central building might
be exclusively law if there is enough
demand, said John.

John said he felt the law students
preferred this arrangement, especially
with the kitchens in Woods Creek,
since law students might not want to
eat in the undergraduate cafeteria

The future of law student housing in
Gaines is still up in the air. According
to John, Gaines was built primarily as
undergraduate housing, although that
does not preclude law students from
living there.

Currently there is a waiting list for
Gaines next year

The administration will use the resi-
dent advisors in Gaines to plan pro-
grams and activities for halls, accord-
ing to John.

According to Nave, the application
form for Gaines looked as though the
administration is trying to set up halls

with “‘themes,’* such as French
majors is One section, and similar
things

John expressed the sentiment that
law students might not want to join in
these activities and themes, although
some might.

lhe future plans are still being dis
cussed

‘I would like to determine if there
is a demand [for law students in
Gaines], and if there is, then we can
construct a policy for responding to
that demand,”* Ruscio said.

the remaining four candidates, former
Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt, The
Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, former
Colorado Senator Gary Hart and Sen.
Albert Gore, Jr., (D-Tenn.) were
running well behind the other three.

The Iowa caucus forecasts by the
W&L Mock Convention predicted
that Gephardt would lead at 24 per-
cent, Dukakis would be in second
place with 18.9 percent and Simon
would follow closely behind him with
17.4 percent of the vote. The W&L
Towa delegation predicted that the re-
maining candidates Babbitt, Jackson,
Hart and Gore would follow in that
order.

Before the caucus on Feb. 8, Iowa

state chairman Bill Madox said, ‘‘The
last round of Gephardt advertisements
seems to have broken things open.”
Sam Conner, chairman of the creden-
tials committee, said, ‘‘Dukakis still
has the twin benefits of a good organi-
zation and plenty of financial support.
Simon will have to rely on his favorite
son appeal and his endorsement in the
Des Moines Register if he is to im-
prove his position.’

According to the Washington Post,
both Simon and Gephardt were rely-
ing on their status as *‘favorite neigh-
bors’’ to win in Iowa.

The W&L Mock Convention also
correctly predicted that Dukakis
would win the majority of the vote in

New Hampshire. The primary fore
casts predicted that Dukakis will wit
42 percent of the vote. Simon, at |‘
percent, was expected to have a sligh
edge over Gephardt’s 16 percent. The
remaining Mock Convention predic
tions stated that the other candidate:
will follow in the order: Jackson. ‘
percent; Gore, 6 percent; Hart, 4 per
cent; and Babbitt, 2 percent

Dukakis won the New Hampshir
primary with 37 percent of the vote
Gephardt followed with 21! percent
and Simon received 18 percent. The
rest of the results were as follows
Jackson, 8 percent; Gore, 7 percent
Babbitt, 5 percent; Hart, 4 percent

OPINION
Theme

With the announcement of this year’s Fancy Dress theme, The
Reconciliation Ball of 1865, controversy already seems to be upon
us. The Minority Student Association, in a letter to the editor this
week, has announced its plans to boycott Washington and Lee’s
biggest social event of the year. This in itself, even if it only affects
attendance slightly, will cast a pall over the event.

Although we do not support the MSA’s planned boycott, we do
understand why they are upset with the theme. It does seem a bit
callous to choose a theme that will alienate an important section of
the student body. The MSA is correct in this: Fancy Dress is for the
entire student body.

If the Student Activities Board wanted a Fancy Dress with an
American theme, surely they could have arrived at something more
suitable for everyone. The Jazz Age would be a good example. One
of the purpose behind Fancy Dress, it seems, is to pick a theme that
deals with something that is not familiar to the university commun-
ity, something a little bit exotic.

We live the Southern way of life every day. It surrounds us in
everything we do. Look at Lee Chapel, the Honor System, the
friendly nature of the students. Because of this, we ask: why have a
theme that is, primarily, southern? It seems like overkill to us.

Still, we can’t endorse the MSA’s decision to boycott, We have
not seen the actual ball as of yet. Although the potential for prob-
lems exists, we believe the SAB will handle the theme tastefully,
and the ball will be a good time for everyone.

We encourage the MSA to reconsider their boycott. If, when they
attend the ball, they find it to be insulting, they should leave and
demand their money back. This way an unnecessary problem can be
avoided.

Forum

A forum is in the planning for a discussion of current and con-
troversial issues. The student organizers, John Falk and Bob
Tompkins, have decided to organize the forum because Contact is
not doing enough to keep the student body in touch with current
events.

Whether or not their claim is true, it is good to see students taking
the initiative in correcting what they see as a problem. In the light of
student apathy, often discussed in this paper, it is refreshing to see
students taking action.

The proposed forum will be debate style and panel members will
be selected for opposing points of view. With audience participa-
tion, this plan promises to be both exciting and informative. Finally
students will be able to do more than just listen to a authority speak-
ing on a topic; they will be able to discuss, argue and learn on topics
that affect everyone.

Of course, the forum will not work if students do not make the
effort to participate. We encourage students to give their support to
the committee in order to ensure its success. Perhaps this will be a
good first step to increased student involvement and awareness.

Get ready

Big Three election time is rolling around, and soon students will
be faced with the task of electing the representatives for next year’s
Executive Committee, and thereby shaping the course of student
life and the Honor System. Candidates for president, vice-president
or secretary need to have their petitions turned in by Monday.

There will be an open forum for candidates on March 1 in Lee
Chapel. Each candidate will be allowed to make a short speech and
answer questions. This is an important function in the election.

W&L students need to be well-informed before they cast a ballot
in the election. When electing students as the administrators of the
Honor System, we should be cautious. We encourage all students to
attend the open forum and listen closely. And most of all, be ready
to vote. If one does not vote, one can not complain about those who
are elected.

Faculty

actions
on frats

By Lewis G. John
Dean of Students

 

I wish to take this opportunity to
make some observations about frater-
nity Rush and pledging, and specifica-
lly to correct some misunde: i
about the action taken by the faculty at
its Feb. 1 meeting.

Contrary to the lead paragraph of
the Ring-tum Phi’s front- page story
on Feb. 4 and the implications of the
editorial of that same issue, the faculty
did not ‘‘take the Interfraternity
Council out of the Rush scheduling
process.’’ The faculty simply left
interim responsibility for fraternity
Rush and pledging—interim, in the
sense of the next couple of years,
prior to the availability of the results
of the self-study exploration of all
facets of the freshman year—just
where it has been, with the Student
Affairs Committee.

The process by which the Student
Affairs Committee determines, in the
words of the faculty motion,
‘*whatever improvements in fraternity
Rush and pledging it deems appro-
priate is left to SAC. It must take into
consideration faculty sentiment, and it
certainly will continue to take into
consideration IFC and student senti-
ment on these matters.’’ As a matter’
of fact, the IFC has already submitted
a proposal for next year to SAC, and I
am sure that it will have other recom-
mendations. This does not mean that
SAC will automatically accept any
and all IFC proposals (as some frater-
nity leaders might wish), but it does
mean that the IFC continues to have
its input, just as it has in recent years.

I would also take issue with Tommy
McBride’s contention (in his letter to
the editor in the Feb. 11 issue) that
many of the members of SAC are
‘*not qualified to vote on the issue.”’
Decisions about Rush and pledging, as
well as about fraternity life in general,
have implications for all of the Uni-
versity community and its many con-
stituencies, not just for those male
students who are members of fraterni-
ties. The Board of Trustees has dele-
gated authority for student life and the
governance of student organizations,
including fraternities, to the faculty,
which has in turn delegated that au-
thority to the Student Affairs Commit-
tee, half of whose voting members are
students. In approaching these issues,
we must be concerned for the Univer-
sity as a whole, including what should
be the primary concern for all of
us—academics.

I shall leave discussion of the sub-
stantive issues raised by the Phi editor-
ial for another time, but I would dis-
agree that the SAC proposal is ‘‘dang-
erously misguided.’’ Many of us be-
lieve that significant reform is needed
not so much in the Rush schedule as in
pledging practices, and that is the
reason that the SAC plan for next year
proposes changes in the timing and
length of the pledge period.

Registration terrifying experience ,

 

MY VIEW
By Margaret Pimblett

 

As I returned to campus after
February Break, I was in good spirits.
I had enjoyed the vacation, slept a lot,
done absolutely no schoolwork,
visited the radio station where I'll
have my summer internship, and met
some fascinating new people, all
within the space of one week.

Life was relatively stable, although
I knew I had plenty of work to do once
I returned to Lexington.

But I knew I could handle it.

I’m used to dealing with a busy
schedule.

But then, I realized what always
happened on the Monday after Febru-
ary Break.

Spring Term Registration.

It started Monday morning, just
after 9 a.m. I’d been awake since 5:30
because I’d done a radio show, and for
someone who usually crawls out of
bed at 9:37 for a 10:00 class and man-
ages to shower, wash and dry hair,
and get dressed and still get to class on
time, a Monday morning schedule like
that is not the easiest to bear.

This time was particularly difficult
because I did the show alone. My
partner had the chance to sleep in, be-
cause I had managed to forget to do
the show the week before break

(sorry, my bad).

So I had just survived three hours of
grudging wakefulness when I hap-
pened to glance at a W&L Weekly Ca-

any student, who already knows what
classes to take and just need to get that
professor’s signature for permission
to be in the class.

If registration frightens someone
who has that much foresight, imagine
how heart-wrenching it is for someone
who hasn’t thought about courses, and
who looks over the class listing only to
find that any class the student is possi-
bly interested in meets at D hour.
Every day of the week.

Doesn’t sound so bad at first. Class
at 11:00, have some lunch, then spend
the afternoon lounging at Goshen or
Panther Falls.

The problem occurs when you real-
ize you really ought to be taking six
credits to keep up with your gradua-
tion plans, and your second choice
class meets at CD, Monday and Wed-
nesday. Okay, so you won’t be able to
take that one after all. There must be
some other course which doesn’t con-
flict. Hmmmmm.... Oh, here’s an in-

LETTERS

1988 Fancy Dress to be boycotted

teresting one. Religion 381, Seminar
in Apocalyptic Literature. But it meets
CD, Tuesdays and Thursdays. ’

Ah, how about Contemporary Is-
sues in Child Development? A good *
idea for any students who expect to be ,
having children sometime during their
lifetimes. When is it scheduled? Mon- *
days through Thursdays, CD hour. ,
There’s still a conflict.

Well, I'll find a three-credit course ‘
in a minute. Let’s look iat finding a
P.E. class. Takes five to graduate, and
spring’s a great term to be out-of- ‘
doors

Skills in Golf could be fun. Doesn’t |
Coach Leslie teach that? At CD, on *
Mondays and Wednesdays or Tues- ;
days and Thursdays. One more try...

Well, I could try to get into horse-
manship, it’s an arranged class sched-
ule. With my luck, by the time I get to
the gym at 9 a.m. on the morning the
juniors are supposed to register, the
class will already be filled with
seniors and the underclassmen who
went in on Monday afternoon to get
the class they wanted.

And I’m still looking for one more
three-credit class. Maybe by this time
next week I'll have figured something
out. How about Math 256, Calculus
IV? It meets FG, MTTHF, so I could
schedule that in. But I don’t have the
prerequisites. Anybody know when
organic chemistry class is scheduled?

 

To the Editor: We, the members of the Minor-
ity Student Association of Washington and Lee
University find this year’s theme of Fancy Dress
to be an insult to us all. Do the members of SAB
actually think that the black students at this uni-
versity can enjoy Fancy Dress when its theme is to
be set in a period in which blacks were oppressed?

We understood before coming to Washington
and Lee that there was a low percentage of black
students; however, we believed that our contribu-
tions to this institution--ranging from the Execu-
tive Committee, Student Recruitment, and dorm
counselors, to our participation in intercollegiate
sports--would serve as a positive symbol of our
love and dedication for this school.

How can we remain positive and help to im-
prove the retention rate of black students and help
with the recruitment of black students of future
classes if we are shown nothing other than a bla-
tant disregard for our achievements? We can’t.
We had no idea that the sixth oldest school in the
nation is also the most racist.

To Mr. Thomas O’Brien, we ask, ‘‘If you want
to attend and Old South party, why don’t you at-
tend the one sponsored by the fraternity?‘

We feel that Fancy Dress should be a celebra-
tion for everyone. Therefore, we, the Minority
Student Association of Washington and Lee,
choose to boycott this year’s Fancy Dress Ball.

More Lip Sync praise

To The Editor:

W&L’s Second Annual Lip Synch Contest for
Multiple Sclerosis was a terrific success. The con-
testants, contributing businesses, audience and

especially the organizer—Jerry Darrell, should be
lauded for their outstanding efforts.

Over $800 was raised during the lip synch
contest. These funds will be used to provide ser-
vices to over 850 people who have MS in the Blue
Ridge Chapter’s area. In addition the funds raised
will be utilized by the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society to further biomedical research in finding a
cause, cure and better treatments of multiple
sclerosis.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, often dis-
abling disease of the central nervous system of
young adults between the ages of 20 and 40. Its
symptoms can run the gamut from slight blurring
of vision or numbness in the extremities to com-
plete paralysis. About one quarter of a million
Americans have multiple sclerosis, with nearly
200 new cases diagnosed every single week.

On over 200 campuses around the country col-
lege students like yourselves have organized Stu-
dents Against Multiple Sclerosis (SAMS) cam-
paigns to raise money and awareness for the fight
to ‘‘short circuit’? MS. A video tape of the Fiji
house’s winning rendition of the Village People’s
*“YMCA”’ will be judged against those of other
SAMS campuses holding a ‘‘Rock Alike’’ lip
synch contest. The top six performers in the coun-
try will appear on a nationally broadcast Rock
Alike Finals from Daytona Beach, Florida on
MTV: Music Television.

Thank you again for helping in the fight against
multiple sclerosis.

From Staff Reports

 

W&L has announced the election of
two new members to its board of
trustees.

William Jacob Lemon of Roanoke,
Va. and A. Stevens Miles of Louisvi-
lle, Ky. were elected to five-year
terms on the board, effective May 20,
1988. The election came during the
board’s winter meeting on campus
Jan. 29-30.

Lemon, a partner with the Roanoke
law firm of Martin, Hopkins, Lemon,
and Carter, P.C., received his B.A.
degree from W&L in 1957 and his
J.D. degree here in 1959. Upon gra-

_Grammy nominated artists
_ to play Lee Chapel Tuesday

 

From Staff Reports

 

Two of America’s foremost women
artists, pianist Ruth Laredo and flutist
Paula Robison, will perform in a dual
recital at W&L on Tuesday, March |,
in Lee Chapel.

The concert is presented by the
W&L Concert Guild, and is open to
season ticket holders. Tickets may
also be purchased at the door for $5,
or $3 for senior citizens and
non-W&L students.

When Ruth Laredo made her debut
with the New York Philharmonic, The
New York Times called her ‘‘the pre-
sent generation’s first truly major
American woman pianist.’’ A most
versatile artist, Laredo has given per-
formances at Carnegie Hall, Alice Tu-
lly Hall, The Kennedy Center and the
White House. She has appeared with
the symphony orchestras of Philadel-
phia, Boston, Cleveland, St. Louis,
Detroit, Baltimore, Houston, Indiana-
polis, Buffalo and with the National
and American Symphonies.

A three-time Grammy nominee,
Laredo has received particular success
with her historic recordings of works
by Rachmaninoff, Scriabin and Ravel.
She is the first person ever t6 have 're-
corded Rathmaninoff’s complete solo
piano works, a five-year project for
CBS Records which produced a series
of seven discs. She has made recent
recordings of Beethoven, Chopin,
Debussy, Tchaikovsky, and Proko-
fiev.

Laredo studied piano with Rudolf
Serkin at the Curtis Institute and made
her New York orchestral debut under
Leopold Stowkowski. In 1984, she
was selected as the special guest sol-
oist at the gala Carnegie Hall Ameri-
can Symphony Orchestra concert
making the centennial of the famed
conductor’s birth.

Paula Robison began to play the
flute at the age of 11, and at 19 went to

School. The following year, she was
invited by Leonard Bernstein to be a
soloist with the New York Philhar-
monic. When she gave her New York
recital debut under the auspices of
Young Concert Artists, The New York
Times wrote, ‘‘music bursts from her
as naturally as leaves from trees.”’

In 1966, Robison became the first
American to win first prize at the
Geneva International Competition.
Since then, she has become one of the
world’s foremost wind soloists, ap-
pearing with orchestras and in recitals
in major concert halls in the U.S.,
Canada, Europe and Japan.

Robison has been profiled by CBS
Television’s ‘‘Sunday Morning,’’ The
New York Times, Musical America,
People, Virtuoso, and Ovation maga-
zines. She has performed on telev-
ision’s ‘‘Live from Lincoln Center,”’
‘Christmas at the Kennedy Center,”’
**The Today Show,’’ and ‘‘The To-
night Show.’’ She is a founding mem-
ber of the Chamber Music Society of
Lincoln Center, and with her hus-
band, noted violist Scott Nickrenz, is
co-director of Chamber Music at the
Spoleto Festivals in Italy, Charleston,
S.C., and Melbourne, Australia.

Robison has commissioned works
for flute,and orchestra‘by Leen Kirch-
ner, ~ Tofu'’ Takemitsti' “ahd “Oliver
Knussen. ‘‘Mountain Songs’’ by
Robert Beaser, written for Robison
and guitarist Eliot Fisk, received a
Grammy nomination in the spring of
1987.

Robison and Laredo tour the U.S.
together each year. Their recordings
of French music (for Second Hearing)
is due for release this season. In their
performance Tuesday evening, they
will together perform works by
Schubert, Hindemith, Faure, Cha-
minade and Manuel de Falla. In solo
performances, Laredo will play works
by Rachmaninoff while Robison will

play a flute solo by Debussy.
A reception tor the performers in

duPont Gallery will follow the recital.

W&L students and faculty donated
136 pints of blood to Tuesday after-

The Chi Psi fraternity sponsored the
blood drive and senior Chris Martin

assisted in running the drive, which

was held in Doremus Gym.

Chi Psi has sponsored the event for
approximately eight years.

Although the amount of blood do-

percent of the goal to match last year’s
donation of 150 pints, the organizers
still deemed participation ‘‘very

~Women win
ODAC title

r

’

'

t

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

A picture-perfect performance was
turned in last weekend by the W&L
women’s swim team.

The Generals, playing host to the
combined Old Dominion Athletic
Conference and Atlantic States
Championship meet, defeated favored
Sweet Briar 620.5-580.5 to win the
ODAC title and to become the first
women’s team in W&L history to win
a conference championship.

But that was not all. The team also
produced over a dozen other outstand-
ing achievements. Nine school re-
cords were broken. Junior Elizabeth
Miles won all her events and was
named ODAC Swimmer-of-the-Year
as well as Atlantic States woman
Swimmer-of- the-Meet. Miles and
freshman Sharon Coleman qualified
for the NCAA Division III National
Championships, and every swimmer
achieved her season-goal time.

‘“*The women’s performance was
just short of a miracle,”’ said head
coach Page Remillard. ‘‘They were

not going to be denied. Their goal was
to be the first W&L women’s team to
win the ODAC championship. The
key was their tenacity. The swimmers
were actually mean about it. That was
not a week to get in their way.”

Remillard referred to the race he
thought epitomized the determination
factor at the meet. Coleman and her
Sweet Briar opponent were neck and
neck throughout the 200-yard butter-
fly event until Coleman just barely
pulled ahead at the finish. Each
swimmer managed to qualify for
nationals with their times—a totally
unexpected result. The competition
was So fierce it forced both women to
achieve their career-best times.

Freshman Rachelle Nock’s perfor-
mance in the 200-yard breaststroke
also exemplified W&L’s de-
termination and supports Remillard’s
choice of the word ‘‘miracle’’ as an
appropriate description of the meet.
Nock cut nine seconds off her best
time for that event—an achievement
Remillard called ‘‘unheard of.”’

‘*This was our best weekend ever,”’

Swimming claims Atlantic States crown, Regionals next

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

In the wake of the incredible per-
formance turned in by the women’s
swim team, the W&L men’s swim
team certainly had no reason to feel
ashamed of its effort last weekend in
Cy Twombly Pool.

All the Generals did was go out and
crush Glassboro and Mary Washing-
ton to win the Atlantic States cham-
pionship. In the process, three more
swimmers qualified for the NCAA
Division III National Championships
and several swimmers swam the best
races of their lives.

Led‘ by sophomore pole vaulter
Phil Sampson, the Washington and
Lee indoor track team completed
its invitational schedule over the
February break and is preparing
for the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championship meet,
set for Saturday afternoon at the
VMI Field House.

Sampson finished third at the
Virginia Intercollegiate Indoor
Track Championships in Blacks-
burg by clearing 15 feet, the qual-
ifying height for the Division If
national championships. So far,
Sampson is the only W&L athlete
to qualify for the March 12 event.

Sampson broke his school record
of 14-6 after tying it twice earlier
in the season.

A 15-foot performance Saturday
should be enough to give W&L a
win in the ODAC pole vault com-
petition, according to head coach
Norris Aldridge, who said most of

 

“It was an outstanding meet,”’ said
head coach Page Remillard, who was
selected as the Atlantic States Men’s
Coach- of-the-Year. ‘‘Including the
women, out of 34 people who had es-
tablished goal times, 33 bettered their
goal times.”’

Team-wise, W&L cruised by its
opposition, scoring 447 points com-
pared to Glassboro’s 316 and Mary
Washington’s 118. Individually
speaking, the Generals got some
excellent showings from three swim-
mers in particular. Junior Moose Her-
ring and sophomore Adam Morgan
qualified for the NCAAs by breaking
the D- Ill qualifying standard in the
400-yard individual medley. Not to be

Track gears up for ODACs

the other vaulters in the conference
have only cleared 13-6.

In the high jump, junior Fray
McCormick returns to defend his
1987 ODAC title, with ‘personal
best of 6-4 in 1988.

But victories by Sampson and
McCormick will not be enough to
give W&L the school’s fifth
straight indoor title. ‘‘If we win it,
it’s going to come on the running
events,’’ said Aldridge.

The Generals will no doubt look
to senior hurdler Andrew White
for some key points. One of the
team’s captains, White is averag-
ing well under eight seconds in the
55-meter high hurdles and was the
ODAC Runner-of-the-Year in in-
door and outdoor track in 1987.

In the distance events, Aldridge
expects good performances from
senior Scott Rippeon, who is ap-
proaching the nine-minute mark in
the 3000 meters, and junior Jamie
Urso, who ran the 800 in 2:01 at
the VMI Relays and should per-
form well on that same track Sat-
urday.

qualified for the NCAAs and broke °

the school record in the 200-yard
breaststroke. Sophomore David Olson
has already qualified for the cham-
pionships earlier in the season.

“It was a quality meet. It was an
exciting meet,’’ said Remillard.
‘*Everyone responded. All the things
we were saying all year long hap-
pened.”’

The Generals travelled to Emory
University to compete in the NCAA
Regional Championships that begin
today and run through Saturday.
W&L will not only attempt to qualify
more swimmers for nationals, but also
try to improve some of its swimmers

‘“‘We’re not trying to get a trip to
Atlanta,”’ said Remillard. ‘‘We’re try-
ing to go down and represent the uni-
versity and score points and come
back with a place at nationals.”’

Remillard also commented on the
reasons for shaving some swimmers,
while holding off on others until re-
gionals or nationals (swimmers shave
off most of their body hair in order to
swim faster times). In the case of Ol-
son, who qualified unshaven earlier,
Remillard said Olson would shave for
regionals to help improve his seeding
in nationals three weeks later (March

17- 19).

“Our plan with David Olson is to
shave him at Atlanta and then come
back three weeks later and go faster,”’
said Remillard. ‘‘There are so many
different things—it’s very complex.
We treat everyone physiologically
differently.”’

Remillard would not mention
names, but he thought the Generals
would qualify at least two more
swimmers for the NCAAs at the re-
gionals. However, as a team, W&L
will be hurt by the absence of the
swimmers who have already qualified
and are remaining in Lexington.

Roanoke
ends hoop
season

The W&L basketball team’s season,
which had been on the skids the past
two weeks, came to a crashing halt on
Tuesday night when the Generals lost
a nail-biter to the Roanoke College
Maroons 83- 81 in the first round of
the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence tournament.

The loss was the Generals’ fifth in a
row—seventh out of their last eight
games—and capped a stretch during
which W&L saw its 15-3 record dissi-
pate to 16-10. There were no excuses.
The team just didn’t play good basket-
ball in the month of February.

But the Generals did redeem them-
selves with their showing against
Roanoke on Tuesday night at the Bast
Center in Salem, Va. The Maroons
came into the ballgame with a 21-0 re-
cord in ODAC tournament play
(Roanoke has won the conference
tournament every year it’s been held)
and seven-consecutive conference
championships. The Maroons had
momentum, having come from behind
in the conference standings to tie
W&L for fourth place and, with all
other tie-breaking criteria even, win
the coin toss for the home-court ad-
vantage in the first round.

But W&L would not go down eas-
ily. The Generals’ strategy was
simple—pound the ball inside to
senior center Harmon Harden and
freshman forward Chris Jacobs to ex-
pose Roanoke’s lack of defense in the
paint. The strategy worked beautifully
as the Generals, behind 14 points by
Jacobs and eight points by Harden, led
by as many as six points throughout
most of the first half.

Roanoke, however, grabbed the
lead late in the first stanza and led

Grapplers fail to qualify, finish at 5-9

The Wék, wrestling season came to
an end last weekend at the NCAA
Eastern Regional Championships,
held at New York University in New
York City.

The Generals failed to qualify any
wrestlers for the NCAA Division II
Nationals which will be held March
2-5 at Wheaton, Maryland.

W&L’s top finisher was senior co-
captain Steve Castle who placed
fourth at 118 pounds. Based on his
performance, Castle stands as the
alternate for his weight class in the
NCAA tournament.

Junior Manoli Loupassi was W&L’s
second-best finisher, placing fifth at
190 pounds.

W&L swept its two matches at the
Davidson Triangular to complete its
regular season with a dual-match re-
cord of 5-9»

The Generals beat Furmian 30-24
behind a number of strong performan-
ces. Senior John Lowe and sophomore
Lee Garlove both won by decision at
134 pounds and 150 pounds, respec-
tively. Senior co-captains Castle (126
pounds) and Kevin McNamara (177
pounds) notched pins for the Generals
while wrestling up in weight class
from their usual slots. McNamara’s
victory sealed the win over the Purple
Paladins.

W&L was aided by four forfeits and
one default which accounted for 30 of
the Generals’ total points as they
breezed by host Davidson 38-13.

‘‘We played around with the lineup
and wrestled well,’’ said head coach

Gary Franke. ‘‘It was a nice way to
end the regular season.”’

Much of the reason for the 5-9 re-
cord was the injuries and illnesses the
grapplers suffered during the year.

There were a few bright spots dur-
ing the season. Although not their
toughest match (benefitted by six wins
by forfeit), W&L smashed Ferrum
59-0 to establish a new school record
for margin of victory in a dual match.
It should be noted that a perfect score
is 60-0.

Franke was also quick to point to
the work of his seniors who finished
their collegiate careers at W&L.
Castle finished the season at 19-4-1,
Lowe at 15-5 and McNamara at 14-6.
Two other senior starters will be lost
to graduation—Greg Russell and Jay
Gorlowski.

second half started ominously

1» W&L. After a James Pennix dunk,
Roanoke went on a short spurt and the
Genet themselves on the
short end of an 11-point differential.
Roanoke was going almost exclu-
to junior guard Patrick Mul-

and he was coming off
s to bury open jumpers. Mul-
downey would lead all scorers with
6, but W&L hung tough.

Where were we in February?”
said head coach Verne Canfield of the
Generals’ patience on offense. ‘‘Why
couldn't we do it then? It’s a classic
example. We had some key people
vho didn’t play up to their already
sstablished standards. Yet if we
played with intensity and played
together and played within the frame-
work that we felt was best for us, we
can play with anybody.”’

Canfield was alluding to the Gen-
inability to work the offense
during the losing streak before Tues-
day night and comparing it with the
comeback they made against the Mar-
oons. Patiently passing the ball around
the perimeter, W&L time and time
gain found Harden inside for easy
points. The lead dwindled to six, then
to four and then to two points with
oO even minutes remaining. Har-
den would finish with 24 points and
the game was back and forth, nip and
tuck, the rest of the way.

Roanoke went up by four with
under two minutes to go and the Gen-
erals seemed to be in trouble. Senior
guard Steve Hancock, the team’s lead-
ing scorer, was having an off night (5
for 17 shooting, 12 points) and W&L
had had trouble in the past playing

long happened.””

   

with composure in a tight ballgame

The Generals cut the lead to two and
then got the ball back with 30 seconds
showing on the game clock. It was do
or-die time for W&L

“I was very proud of the kids, ex
cept at the end there,”’ said Canfield
““Why didn’t we go inside like you
were supposed to. We didn't. Michael
[Holton] wanted the shot, Michael
took the shot."

Holton took a tough 17-footer with
six seconds left and the ball bounced
off the front rim. Senior center Lou
Trosch tracked the loose ball down in
the right corner, but he was forced to
throw up an off-balanced jumper. The
ball hit the side of the backboard as the
buzzer sounded and the Generals had
been eliminated in the first round of
the tournament for the second-straight
year.

“T hated to end the season on a bad
note,’* said Canfield. “* Yet there was
something positive about it, because
we came back.”’

What wasn’t positive were the four
games W&L lost before post-season
play even began. On Thursday, Feb.
ll, the Generals travelled to Mary
Washington and got trounced 86-73.
W&L played horribly on the boards,
being outrebounded 46-26. Mary
Washington took a 42-32 halftime
lead and were never seriously
threatened after that. Hancock led the
Generals with 18 points and freshman
forward Ed Hart chipped in 14.

That led into Roanoke-W&L Game
No. 2 at Roanoke on Saturday. The
Generals shot a miserable 39 percent
from the floor and the Maroons pulled
away late enroute to a 85-76 victory.
The Generals could still clinch the
fourth-place slot with a win on the
road against either Eastern Mennonite
or Maryville. It was not to be.

The Generals visited the E-M
Royals on Tuesday, Feb. 16 and lost
at the buzzer 74-73. E-M lit up the
baskets, shooting 62 percent for the
game (72 percent in the second half),
including 3-3 from three-point range,
as the Generals blew a 15-point lead.
Eugene Baltimore, who assisted on
the winning basket, burned W&L’s

defense for 25 points. Hart’s 20 and

Remillard explained that the team
focused on winning the championship
this season, a different strategy from
last year’s concentration on an un-
defeated dual-meet season.

“They had one thing on their
minds. The team had given up so
much time over each vacation that
they couldn’t afford to make mis-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Senior center Harmon Harden goes up for two of his 24 points in

Tuesday’s loss to Roanoke.

Harden’s 16 were the offense for the
Generals.

Maryville on Thursday night gave
no friendlier welcome. The Scots,
who seem to save their best for W&L
steamrolled over the Generals 98-75.
Holton led all scorers with 21 points
(five three-pointers) but Maryville had
six players score in double figures and
the Scots never looked back after soar-
ing out to a 49-38 halftime lead.

The season, which had such promis-
ing beginnings, did have some bright
spots. The Generals knocked off
Bridgewater, then ranked No. 4 in the
nation in Division II, and Roanoke in
the Warner Center before a _near-
capacity crowd. But the final month
was so disastrous, especially with the

takes,”’ he said. ‘‘And they didn’t.”’

The women ended with an accom-
plishment that surpassed everyone’s
expectations. Remillard had final
words of praise.

“Every goal was reached—a very
rare occurrence in sports. Hardly any
team accomplishes all it intends to do.

high expectations brought about by the
fast start.

One person who did not fail to live
up to expectations was Hancock. The
senior co-captain was the General's
leading scorer, averaging ~7.6 points
per game. He was also the team’s
fourth- leading rebounder, first in
minutes played, first in steals and first
in assists. He also finished as W&L’s
12th most prolific scorer in history
with 1215 career points. For his out
standing achievements, Hancock was
named by the opposing coaches to the
first team all-ODAC squad and, prob
ably even more impressive, to the
National Association of Basketball
Coaches South-Atlantic All-District
First Team.

But the W&L women did.”’

The team travelled to Emory Uni-
versity to compete in the NCAA Re-
gional Championships, which are be
ing held today through Saturday. The
Generals go into the meet attempting
to add even more NCAA national qua-
lifiers.

A Letter from the President...

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY
LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

A Fancy Dress message from the President

Fancy Dress is both an event and a tradition at Washington and Lee.

The event itself has changed greatly over the years since it first occurred
back in 1907. Older alumni recall the elegant costumes, the formal "figures"
honoring the president of Fancy Dress and its other officers, old Doremus as
King Arthur's Court, Shakespeare's Globe Theater, the Emerald City of 0z, or
some other magical transformation. For other alumni, Fancy Dress evokes memories |
of a chandeliered ballroom in Evans Hall, with dancers in black tie instead of
rented costumes. For alumni of the 70's, Fancy Dress was 2,000 persons jampacked
into the University Center and Evans Hall for a thematic smorgasbord of musical
entertainment. In recent years, the variety of enjoyment has continued in
Fancy Dress's return to Doremus and the Warner Center.

The tradition that draws all of these differing memories together is a
simple one. Fancy Dress is always fun, always exciting, always worth the time,
effort and considerable expense that Washington and Lee students have devoted
to its creation over many decades.

Like all of the Fancy Dress weekends before, Fancy Dress for 1988 will
represent the best efforts of a relatively small number of energetic, creative
and dedicated persons to extend this grand social heritage for the enjoyment of
their fellow students, the faculty and staff, and the alumni of our University.
As we delight in what they have. accomplished we acknowl edge our gratitude for
their labors on our behalf.

For everyone attending Fancy Dress this year, I hope the evening is one
you will remember with pleasure all the rest of your life.

Ball of 1865 is

theme for 81st Fancy Dress

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

The theme for the 81st annual
Fancy Dress Ball is the Recon-
ciliation Ball of 1865.

Chosen for its historical signi-
ficance, the Reconciliation Ball
will showcase Civil War cos-
tumes and decorations from both
the north and the south including
buildings you might see in New
York and Philadelphia, southern
carriages and a gazebo.

The royal treatment will begin
as you and your date ascend the
red carpeted stairs outside of the
Warner Center flanked by

lighted trees. A 12 by 18 foot
American flag will drape down
over the top of the doorway.

The lobby of the Warner
Center will be decorated with
blown up posters and the front
pages of newspapers from the
time of the Civil War. A buggy,
papered in red, will sit off to the
side.

As you enter the big gym, the
Glenn Miller Ochestra will be
sitting at the far end of the gym.
Behind it will hang the 36 state
flags of the states that were
members of the union in 1865 on
a gray background with a blue
border. Across from that on the
wall with the stairs leading up
the 500 level of the Warner
Center will be a_ two-story

southern mansion complete with
columns and trees covered with
Spanish moss. :

On the Gilliam Dormitory side
of the gym will be a Northern
street scene with a Northern
Park and a couple of buildings
that you might have seen in
downtown New York, Boston,
or Philadelphia at the time of the
Civil War. In front of the scene
will be a cobblestone street with
street signs and lighted trees.

On the opposite wall will be a
Southern scene featuring a white
carriage, park benches and a
gazebo surrounded by dogwood
trees, azealas, and rose blos-
soms.

The little gym will be dec-
orated like a paddlewheel river-

boat. The wall closest to the Ath-
letic offices will be decorated
like a paddlewheel while porth-
oles and other nautical dec-
orations adorn the sides of the
gym. Marshall Crenshaw and
Indecision will be set on a stage
to the right of the hall entrance.

One of the most appealing
things about the Reconciliation
Ball of 1865 theme was the
possibility of bringing back the
wearing of costumes to the ball.
While this is an exciting and
creative element of Fancy Dress,
everyone must remember that
we at Washington and Lee are
expected to act like gentlemen,
and ladies, at all times. If wear-
ing a costume, use tasteful
judgement.

The Reconciliation Ball of
1865 is an exciting theme for
Washington and Lee. The Civil
War played not only a great part
in American history but in that
of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity as well. Robert E. Lee holds
a special place in the heart of
each student here and what bet- .
ter way to celebrate him, our
school, and the union of what
was our war-torn nation that at
the biggest collegiate social
event in the nation; our very own
Fancy Dress Ball.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Wel-
come to the Reconciliation Ball
of 1865, the 81st annual Fancy
Dress Ball at Washington and
Lee University. Let the fes-
tivities begin.

The Long and Winding Fancy Dress Road

By Marshall Boswell
Staff Reporter

 

The official date given for the
first Fancy Dress Ball is Febru-
ary 1907. That’s eighty-one
years ago, for those of you with-
out a calculator. But that’s not,
necessarily, eighty-one Fancy
Dress Balls. Indeed, the history
of our little winter term shindig
is rich with anecdote and cultural
signigicance.

It is appropriate that we look
back at the origins of Fancy
Dress on this, its eighty-first
birthday. Although the common
belief is that a one Miss Annie Jo

White started FD all those years
ago, actually the idea of a major
ball was brewing long before her
initial efforts.

The first reference to a
“Fancy Dress’’ anything was a
blurb in the September 27, 1876
issue of the Southern Collegian
concerning a ‘‘Fancy Dress
Hop.’’ For nearly a decade be-
fore that, however, students here
had been putting on dances and
hops—without sanction from the
university—in off-campus build-
ings, stables, or wherever a band
could set up and folks could cut a
rug or two. These hops met with
profound disapproval from cam-

pus authorities, but the kids kept
at it.

In December of 1871, the Col-
legian sent a reporter to W&L to
cover a hop put on by a myster-
ious group of men calling them-
selves, appropriately enough,
the ‘‘Student Social Club.’’ The
reporter described the men as.
“‘elegantly dressed,’’ while the
women these fellows were lucky
enough to be escorting were

dubbed ‘‘simply bewitching.”’ |

‘‘The Fancy Dress Hop’’ that
followed several years later was
called a ‘‘great success’’ by the
Collegian and this inspired a ser-
ies of similar endeavors, the
most creative of which was the
*‘Finals Ball’’ held during exam
week of 1879. The Collegian re-
porter complained that this par-
ticular dance was simply too
short: it ended at 3 a.m..

Public sentiment was in vio-
lent opposition to this new inter-
est in balls and hops. |.
Protestant churches and trustees
rose up in anger against this ‘‘li-
centious”’ flurry of activity. One
fellow, observing the 1879
commencement exercises, said
he ‘feared the passing of old
times.”’ ,He went on to say,
‘What would ‘Stonewall’ Jack-
son think of the youth in Lexing-
ton dancing to the licentious
german or disgusting racket?’
Lastly, he worried that the girls
were doing simply to much hug-
ging.

Even the Gazette concurred,
writing ‘*The time has come for
the public sentiment of the
Christian people of Lexington to
discountenence the lascivious
dancing which we are sorry to
say is being introduced here.”’

But local satirist *“G. Whili-
kins, fought back with these
wise words: ‘‘As long as there is
music and young folks, it will git

(sic) into their toes... Girls like to

be hugged, and the boys like to
hug them. The question is
whether it is better to do it in the
ballroom or behind the door.”’

The first real Fancy Dress Ball
came a decade later. The
school’s then-current librarian,
Miss Annie Jo White, enter-
tained a group of her student
friends witha costume party one
February evening in 1907. Be-
cause she felt that the students
needed something to spark up
the mid-winter dullness, she
sought to make the affair an an-
nual event.

A Fancy Dress from years past.

It took some doing, but she
eventually rustled up enough
student enthusiasm to make the
Fancy Dress Ball one of the
highlights of the W&L social
calendar. Miss White was the
undisputed Queen of Fancy
Dress for 13 years, and in later
years was even paid $50 for her
services.

It was after her death in 1922,
however, that the Fancy Dress
Ball really took off. By 1928,
The New York Times described it
as ‘‘the South’s outstanding col-

legiate social event,’’ even

though that ball was something
entirely different from the event
we celebrate now. For starters,
it was a costume ball, elaborate
and glittering, with exotic
European themes setting the
pace. Famous big bands frequen-
ted the ball, and the music was
routinely broadcast on network
radio hook-ups all over the
nation. Fancy Dress, it has been

observed, began the same year

Henry Ford was working on the

first Model T: It was the quites-
sence of the Edwardian Age.

Fancy Dress was elaborate,

 

aristocratic, imaginitive, and
even perhaps snobbish. But it
was born out of an earnest desire
to create a wonderland here on
campus, and more often than
not, succeeded.

There were no Fancy Dress
Balls during the. second World
War, and the tradition didn’t
quite survive the turbulent Six-
ties, but through it all, Fancy
Dress just seems to keep crop-
ping up every winter. Like a
breath of fresh air.

Off to the ballroom, ladies and
gentlemen.

Fancy Dress, one of the
nation’s largest parties, a time
for great bands and people, is
also the right time to go out and
enjoy a good meal with a date.
Or, for those who dare venture
to Fancy Dress without a date,
good friends.

Towards this end, the sou-
thwest region of Virginia can
more than adequately cater to
such dining needs. Tucked away
in Charlottesville, Staunton,
Lexington, Lynchburg and
Roanoke are some great dining
establishments.

In this articles I have tried to
put together a list of some of
these places with a brief descrip-
tion and essential details for
each. I can not claim to have ea-
ten at all the restaurants (or even
one-third of them, for that mat-
ter) but the restaurants listed
have good reputations or have
otherwise been recommended to
me. In most cases a call to the
maitre d’ was necessary.

At this point, I must admit that
after re-reading the descriptions,
this may not be a fair article. The
descriptions may appear that I
am trying to head you to a parti-
cular restaurant.

I must also admit that I do
have a personal favorite, the
White Star Mill, but please don’t
let the sound or size of a descrip-
tion discourage you—I don’t
think you can go wrong with any
of them.

Personally, I am off to the
Green Briar, West Virginia (and
yes it should be wild, and yet at
the same time, sort of wonder-
ful). I hope to give you all the
full report in the next issue of
The Ring-tum Phi.

In any case, whether you
choose a restaurant from this list
or dine at your own favorite, eat
well and with a group of friends
for ‘‘good dining company
makes for better din-
ing’’—wherever. And _ please,
don’t ruin the weekend for your
family and friends by overin-
dulging and driving. Obey the
rules of the road and use com-
mon sense. I hope this list proves
helpful in making your Fancy
Dress Weekend successful.

and a restaurant. Though the
menu lacks international flare
they do serve duck. The glory of
the Boar’s Inn is solid American
cuisine prepared impeccably.

company a meal nicely. Re-
servations and jackets for men
are required.

The Ivy Inn, 2244 Old Ivy
Road (across from Ivy gar-
dens—one mile from University
of Virginia), 977- 1222.

Dine by candle-light in this
restored large house, built circa
1803. The menu at the Ivy Inn
varies greatly, including
chicken, beef, veal, and lamb.
Prices range from $10.50 to
$14.00. Despite the romantic
atmosphere, Mrs. Abbot, the
proprietor, permits a “‘just be
comfortable”’ style of dress, but
she would appreciate re-
servations. All spirits are ser
ved.

The C&O Restaurant, 515 E.
Water, 971- 7044.

This may be one of Char-
lottesville’s, and southwest Vir-
ginia’s, most enjoyable and
unique restaurants. At the C&O
Restaurant, the emphasis of the
dining experience is on the food
(‘the focus of the senses’’) and
as such the formal dining room
(coat and tie required) is dec

orated all white--white linen,
white walls and white floors.
The French cuisine is served a la
carte but unlike European res-
taurants the portions are large.
Don’t pass up the opportunity to
enjoy your meal with a bottle of
wine from the C&O’s extensive
wine cellar which has been voted
one of the top 100 in the nation
by Wine Spectatormagazine. En-
tree prices range from $18.25 to
$25. Bill Hubert, the manager,
says that the experience is
unique but honestly admits that
you may love it or hate it. There
are two seatings for dinner, the
first at 6:30 and the second at
9:30.

Staunton

Buckhorn Inn, 12 miles west of

Staunton, Route 250 W. Church-
ville, 337-6900.

The Buckhorn Inn is a very
casual restaurant serving a $9.50
seafood buffet on Friday. Enjoy
beer, wine and a lot to eat be-
tween the hours of 4:00 and
9:00. Reservations are not
necessary but you may want to
call ahead just to be sure.

i

 

The Belle Grae Inn, 515 W.
Frederick St. (Downtown),
886-5151.

The Belle Grae Inn has a bis-
tro serving an a la carte menu
and a dining room located in the
old inn. Dinner varies from
night to night according to the
chef's choices. Each night there
is a choice of three different
meals which include appetizer,
soup, entree and dessert for the
set price of $20. A full bar will
add an additional price per
drink. Dress is optional and re-
servations are not required
though it may be well advised to
call ahead to check on the crowd
and menu.

The White Star Mill,
St. , 885- 3409.

Truly one of the finer estab-
lishments around. The White
Star Mill is not cheap but is de-
finitely worth it for the tremen-
dous variety of dishes. Appe-
tizers range from escargot to a
variety of soups. Desserts are a
la carte and plentiful but the en-
trees are the bill of the day

impeccable detail and taste. An
evening at the White Star Mill
for two, including a few indul-
gences into the full bar, will run
around $80 to $100 but, oh boy,
it’s well worth the expense if you
can afford it.

Lexington

The Willson-Walker House, 30
N. Main St. , 463- 3020.

The Willson-Walker House is
similar to old inn dining. There
are several rooms which add to
its coziness and eliminates much
of the hustle and bustle of large
one-room restaurants. Cocktails,
beer and wine will complement
your meal. The menu is strong
with beef, seafood and chicken
dishes. Entrees are prepared a
variety of different ways, includ-
ing Southern American. The lo-
cation is a plus and convenience
in choosing the restaurant for it
is walking distance from most
parts of town. Prices range from
around $8 to about $15. Re-
servations are a must during
Fancy Dress and coat and tie are
recommended.

Fancy Dress—a fairy tale
night. The full moon gazes be-
nignly on a stirring Lexington,
bathing the city in pale light,
beaming on those who are to
commence an endless evening of
fantasy. Perfumed, made-up and
coiffed to perfection, I slip into a
gorgeous gown, a_ princess

So I started to think what I
could say about the renowned
Fancy Dress Ball. The first ob-
vious thing to do was to go back
to that blurry five day weekend
and try to scrape up some data
on the event. But as I began to
think, I realized that it was just
that...blurry! Surely it must have

meant something to me
though...I don’t know—have
some relevance.

Well I'll tell you what *‘was”’
relevant, at least at the time. I
lost my bow tie, I got hollan-
daise all over my lapel, my
roommate lost the tap for the
after-party, I never saw my girl-
friend again, and I didn’t even
get to see Asha the elephant!
You say, ‘wait a minute, did I
just hear something about your
girlfriend in between the tap and
the elephant?’’ I know it sounds
absurd, even tragic, but we just

holds me, and almost shyly,
hands me red roses.

We rush off, arm in arm, to
the chariot waiting outside,
which wisks us away to an inti-
mate restaurant. We sit in a cor-
ner, the shadows cast by flicker-
ing candles playing hide and
seek around our faces. For once
in my life I don’t worry about
getting food caught in my teeth
or using the wrong fork—no, to-
night is perfect. Our words, our
actions, the night itself is en-
chanted; nothing can or will go
wrong.

After wining and dining me,
my god-like escort leads me on
his arm to the ball itself. What

probably thinking that my FD
stunk. That’s what I was think-
ing too for a while, but when it
was over I realized that in fact, I
had had a blast.

Anyway here we are. It’s Fri-
day night, the Ball is near and
my girlfriend and I have just had
another big blow out. What per-
fect timing, I remember thinking
as we walked toward Doremus.
After all this is FD and certainly
no time to be in a fight with your
girlfriend. The night was cool
and clear though and at least I
thought something was on my
side. The sky, deep and almost
purple, was a warm welcome
from the cold shoulder I was re-
ceiving from my girlfriend.~
Sounds corny, but as the sweep-
ing spot lights began to lure us in
and as we walked closer and
closer, we began to forget about
the fights and the stupid little
things. It was as if the excite-
ment of FD was taking over as
our minds began to drift toward
and ponder the events soon to
appear.

The interior amazed us: a gym
transformed into a jungle. I re-

ballroom. As we begin to dance
gracefully, our feet hidden by
magically misty air, the other
couples turn to stare. Never have
any two people seemed more
like one, gliding across the floor
in perfect rhythm, laughing
gaily. The soft lights in the room
follow us around as though at-
tracted magnetically. He leans
and whispers softly into my ear,
and I arch my neck back and
smile into those watery pods of
his eyes which reflect my happi-
ness.

I wake from my dream with a
sigh. My date doesn’t have to be
an Adonis, and the chariot can
be a beat-up Ford. I just hope I
get a date.

Frank Sinatra tune, the dimmed
lights, the scent of the tropical
leaves. I don’t know, it all kind
of gave me a feeling of impor-
tance, like we had finally surpas-
sed those awkward high school
dances and had finally reached
something of significance and
something most importantly to
remember.

Those magical hours in the
Dark Continent began to erase
the reality behind us. We even
began to laugh as we forgot what
exactly it was those fights were
all about! That is what Fancy
Dress is to me: A time to step
outside of reality and enter an
imaginative world where things
like next week’s tests are insigni-
ficant and the only important
thing is that moment.

Fancy Dress probably means a
lot of different things to different
people. To some it might just be
a good time. To others though, it
might mean something more,
perhaps tradition or nostalgia.
For me at least, Fancy Dress has
the magical ability to transport
me back to a time where yester-

day and tomorrow mean nothing
and today, means all.

The South’s Greatest Party, an

The thing I remember most
about last year’s Fancy Dress is
that I got caught as soon as I
walked into the gym. I wasn’t
really doing anything wrong, of
course, but a friend of mine who
was working security really
wanted to get one of those little
bracelets on my wrist.

I didn’t even want to drink at
Fancy Dress. A freshman would
have been so out of place among
all the seniors and juniors on the
balcony where alcohol was being
served. But I got snagged any-
way. The night was off to a great

is only a question of how your
luck holds and what your attitude
is going in. So, after milking as
much attention as is humanly
possible in deciding who
“receives your bid,’’ by all
means dive right in. Folks,
Fancy Dress is a happenin’
thing. At very worst, you’ll lose
consciousness sometime Thurs-
day and resurface during the day
on Sunday with no clue as to
how your weekend went, but sat-
isfied that it did, indeed, live up
to its touting. Now that’s a W&L
tradition. Ladies and Gentle-
men, welcome to Washington
and Lee.

amazing what they can do with
that gym. The bands were terri-
fic, although it is rather embar-
rassing to be dancing in a long
dress to the sounds of the Hoo-
doo Gurus while your politics
professor is looking on.

The most impressive thing
about the ball is its impact on

‘this university. It is one of the

great W&L traditions. It is also
the cause for much anxiety about
dates, clothes, dinner plans, and
such. For some, the arrival of
Fancy Dress weekend is festive
and exciting, for some it is
stressful. Thoughts of Fancy
Dress elicited a strange and wide
variety of reactions from the
girls on my hall, everything
from elation to depression to
feigned indifference. But the fact
is that no one can be indifferent
to Fancy Dress— it is the light at
the end of a long, dark Winter
term tunnel.

| When I think of Fancy Dress,

I think of more than just a great
party weekend. To me, Fancy
Dress represents the advent of
spring at Washington and Lee,
or at least a spring spirit that
visibly unleashes itself upon the
souls of the entire Washington
and Lee community.

Senior

Yes, the weekend (or week,
depending on how far you want
to push it) is incredible. Yes, the
Thursday night concert always
promises to feature a hot rock
band. Yes, the ball is always a
new, unforgettable spectacle of
extravagance. And Yes, the par-
ties are ‘‘raging‘* non-stop.

But more important than all of
this, Fancy Dress creates smiles
that are real, transforming some
of the hardest hit winter
scrooges into fun-loving spring
bees.

Have you suddenly noticed
many more women showing up
at your fraternity parties? Even
Graham-Lees has been taken
over by the surrounding
women’s colleges. This is only
because the Fancy Dress season
is approaching, and although
many girls refuse to admit it,
they hope to be asked. As soon
as one girl is invited she be-
comes the envy of others. In
many ways F.D. weekend is
much dreaded. Perhaps this is
because many feel it is an honor
to be a part of Fancy Dress. I
tend to agree, simply because

F.D. is not only a well-known
event in Virginia, but also in
other surrounding areas. Even in
my home state of New York,
people have either heard of or at-
tended the Fancy Dress Ball.

All in all, Fancy Dress is the
BIG DEAL that people seem to
make it. Never have I seen such
a motivated and organized group |
of students so dedicated to make
a school function such a success.
Fancy Dress is not merely for
the students, but also faculty,
alumni, and even parents. It is
probably the most festive social
function that can brighten up the
winter months. What does F.D.
entail? A four-day party that is
definitely worth the exhaustion.
If you are at all hesitant about
Fancy Dress, don’t be! Give it a
chance; it is a weekend you will
remember.

FANCY DRESS— two of the
most popular words that a Wash-
ington and Lee student can utter.
The thought alone brings to
mind some of the most cherished
memories I possess. This is,
without a doubt, the most festive
activity on the school calendar.
In case you have not experienced
Fancy Dress before, or if you
are considering leaving for the
weekend because you cannot
find the right date, please allow
me two minutes of your time.

Make any necessary arrange-
ments to be in Lexington, Vir-
ginia between the second and the
sixth of March, 1988, for these
days will provide you with some
of the best fun and festivities that
you will experience anywhere,
anytime. But before this time ar-
rives, you have one task— that
of finding one individual with
whom to share in the grand
splendor of this eagerly awaited

to...What?...Oh, you do...O.K.
sure, no problem—No, I really
wasn’t hungry anyway... Sure,
well, I—I guess you can pick me
up later then... What? Oh, yeah,
I suppose I could meet you there
if you’d rather. But, how will I
fing you im ail the
crowd?...0.K. sure. I guess it
doesn’t matter...(pause) Oh, by
the way, what’s the deal about
tomorrow? You know, I’ve al-
ways thought Fancy Dress Sat-
urday is more fun than the ball
itself. Isn’t there a big party at
your house tomorrow afternoon
with that band from Georgia? I
heard some people talking about
it and they said they were fantas-
tic! I can’t wait to see... What?
Oh, really...I guess not... That’s
O.K....No, actually I was prob-

woman from one of the neigh-
boring colleges who would gla-
dly give away her Daddy’s
BMW to have **THE BID‘ ex-
tended her way. If you are a girl,
blow some guy’s mind and ask
him. Whatever you do, just be
there.

The festivities will begin
around Wednesday and run non-
stop through the weekend. Peo-
ple will congregate at the Pit, at
the new Student Activities Pavi-
lion (for a top-name band, we
hope), at the Warner Center for
the ball itself, and at every loca-
tion of campus organization for
parties of every sort. The Fancy
Dress experience, I dare say,
will not let you down. As a
senior staring graduation in the
face, I realize that there are in-
numerable things that I will sin-
cerely miss about my undergra-
duate years. Fancy Dress is right
event. If you are a guy and need
a date, check out The Palms any
night before March |, or better
yet, just be seen in public and
you are bound to find some

ably going to do something else
anyway...(pause) Well, do you
think you’ll be free by Saturday
night for the..no, I didn’t think
so...Yeah, I know what you
mean— I hate fighting the
crowds too. (pause) Well, I also
heard about a small group going
up to the parkway on Sunday if
you’d like to go and we
could...Yeah, I have to study
too...(pause) Well, I...I guess
I’ll meet you at the ball later to-
night then...O.K.— talk to you
soon. Thanks for calling. Bye.’’

“‘Liz, who was. that on the
phone?”’

**Oh, It was my date calling to
work out the details for the
weekend. He’s such an awesome
guy—I’m really excited! It’s go-
ing to be a greatweekend!””

around the top of the list. It is the
most eagerly awaited weekend
of the year, as people arrive
from all over the nation simply
to experience this colossal occa-
sion.

Quite frankly, I cannot think
of a better way to spend four or
five days and nights. One of the
best and most unique qualities
about W&L is the personable
nature of our community. Fancy
Dress is the perfect personifica-
tion of this characteristic. It
brings together everyone who
has any tie with the University
for quality celebrating. For just a
while, the cliques and the bar-
riers of our social lives are
stripped away so that we can all
enjoy time together, an other-
wise nonexistent condition. I
hope everyone can come away
from Fancy Dress with the same
satisfaction that I have been able
to enjoy. Grab a date, call some
friends from home, and be sure
to find yourself in Lexington in
early March; for a better time
cannot be found.

Love Tractor & Marshall Crenshaw headline FD

 

By Greg Unger
Music Critic

 

Chalk Fancy Dress 1988 up as
one that almost was, in a sense.
We almost got either Echo and
The Bunnymen, Guadalcanal
Diary, or (as it was rumored)
INXS. The Bands that the
SAB were able to procure for
our listening pleasure this
Thursday and Friday night lack
the general exposure of the big
name groups, yet possess much
of the same musical intensity,
inspired lyrics, and professional
delivery of their more well
known counterparts. As every
one doesn’t realize, it isn’t all
that easy to get the superstars,
they have to be touring this area
at the time. Lucky for us that
Love Tractor, Drivin’ N Cryin’,
and Pinocchio’s Nose stepped in
to fill the void on Thursday and
Marshall Crenshaw appears on
Friday.

Love Tractor continues to be a
major factor in the college music
scene and at Washington and
Lee in particular. The Athens
Ga. quartet of Michael Rich-
mond (guitar, vocals), Ar-
mistead Wellford (bass, vocals),
Andrew Carter (drums) and
Mark Cline on guitars are per-
ennial Van Riper’s favorites who
have garnered much playing
time in the Virginia area at selec-
ted college campuses. Coming
off their hugely successful album
This ain't No Outerspaceship,
they bring to W&L a fervently
acoustic band, ‘‘Rolling more
than rocking through instrumen-
tal layering and rich textures’’.
We can expect a vocally accen-
tuated effort from a group who

 

Marshall Crenshaw

are confident enough in them-
selves to give us just
that—themselves—without _ hid-
ing behind the glitz of theatrics
and garbled machinery of synth-
esizers.

Love Tractor emerged out of

the trendy ‘‘Southern guitar re-
vival Americana crap’’ (ca.

with on the new music scene.

great kick-off to your F.D.
weekend.

Drivin’ N Cryin’, you may
remember, was phenomenally
popular up at WLUR about this
time last year--and with good
reason. The Atlanta trio has only
been playing as a group for a
little over two years now, but
they have the poise and charisma
coupled with the fundamental
capability to rock that distingui-
shes them from the veritable
plethora of imposters. Believe it
or not, they combine punk,
country, and acoustic material to
form their own unique sound,
epitomized on their highly ac-
claimed Ip, Scarred But Smar-
ter. Many of the tracks mirror
the band’s ‘‘affinity for banging
out hard driving rock’n’roll with
unyielding energy and punk in-
tensity’. ‘‘Scarred But Smar-
ter’, ‘Another Scarlet Butterf-
ly’’, and ‘‘Count the Flowers’

 

are songs that you've heard be-
fore.

Pinocchio’s Nose opens the
concert Thursday night at the
pavilion. Never heard of them?
Neither have I, except recently
when somebody somewhere told
me that they were a good band.
What the hell, start your night
early and get up there and give
these guys a_ chance--you’ll
probably be ecstatic that you did.
Tickets for the entire show are
only $5.00 per couple, and doors
open at 8 p.m..

Kevin Kinney is chief song-
writer, backed up by Tim Porter
(of Nightporter fame), and Jeff
Sullivan on drums. They bring
their show on the road following
the release of their latest Ip in
January. ‘‘Together the mem-
bers of Drivin’ N “Cryin have
created a sound, filled with

warmth and sincerity encapsuled
in blazing guitars, that has won
them loyal fans around the coun-
try’’. When they roll into Lex-
ington Thursday night, they
should feel right at home.

Marshall Howard Crenshaw is
the featured attraction Friday
night at the 1988 Fancy Dress
Ball. He was born in Detroit,
Michigan on November 11,
1953. He is married, is 5°9‘‘,
137 lbs., has brown hair, green
eyes, and his favorite color is
blue. If these colors don’t seem
right to you, don’t adjust your
set, but turn up the volume.
Marshall plays some pretty good
music.

His latest effort, Mary Jean
and 9 Others, produced by Don
Dixon is no exception to that
rule. He just earned a platinum
single in Britain for ‘‘Favorite

, | Fancy Dress Supplement, February 25, 1988, Page 9

Waste of Time’’, worked on the
movie Peggy Sue Got Married,
and starred as Buddy Holly in
the hit movie La Bamba. So, he
is a consummate entertainer as
well as a proven performer. Be-
sides, my twin brother Eric likes
him a lot I think. Past Ip’s in-
clude Marshall Crenshaw, Field
Day, and Downtown.

Marshall's favorite foods are
fried fish, sushi, and pizza. He
has a dog named Fredrod, a rab-
bit named Shep, and he likes the
smell of gasoline and Jason
Faust when he hasn't showered
in 4 days. Oh yeah, he doesn’t
like cheap disgusting food or TV
preachers, so Jimmy Swaggart
you sex-crazed devil worshipper
you, had better stay out of town.
As for the W&L community ,

this Fancy Dress Ball should be
a great one—hope to see you
there.

Some things never change and
just get better with age.

A legend Lives on as the Glenn
Miller Orchestra swings into
Lexington to set the mood for
Fancy Dress

Glenn Miller launched the
band that lives today in 1938,
becoming one of the most suc
cessful dance bandleaders in th
Swing era of the 1930's and
40’s. A matchless string of hit

records, the impact of radio
broadcasts and the drawing
power at theaters, hotels and
dance pavilions built and sus
tained the momentum of popu-
larity.

At the height of popularity
Miller disbanded his musical or-
ganization in 1942 to volunteer
for the army. He went on to
form the Army Air Force Band
playing all over Europe for the
G.I.’s. On December 15, 1944
Major Miller took off in a
single- engine plane from Eng-
land to precede his band to
France and was never seen
again. The Army declared him
dead a year later.

Popular demand urged the
Miller Estate to form the present
Glenn Miller Orchestra in 1956
under the direction of drummer
Ray McKinley.

The current 19-member band
consisting of the leader, five
saxophone players, four trum-
peters, four trombonists, three
rhythm musicians and two vocal-
ists, continues to play many of
the original Miller arrange-
ments. The band is also playing
more modern selections in the
big-band style, carefully select-
ing those newer tunes that lend
themselves to the Miller sound.
The male and female singers
perform both individually and as
part of the Moonlight Serenaders
vocal group. The entire reper-
toire now exceeds 1700 compo-
sitions and keeps the band popu-
lar with young and old audien-
ces.

The Glenn Miller Orchestra
has always been very musical
and visually entertaining, main-
taining its own distinctive sound.

That sound is created by the
clarinet holding the melodic line,
doubled or coupled with the
tenor sax playing the same notes
and the harmonies produced by
three other saxaphones, while
growling trombones and wailing
trumpets add their ooh-ahs.

The band and the sound have
staying power, the popularity
never seeming to wane, and just
like the tradition of Fancy Dress,
the Miller sound lives forever.

Don‘ let your ‘glasses blur
your vision.

   

Whether a glass holds 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1'/ ounces of spirits, the alcohol
content is the same. It’s important to know this because the size and shape of the glass can give
people a distorted impression of how much alcohol they’re actually drinking.

So when you're out to share some cheer with friends, remember how much alcohol is in your
glass and that drinking sensibly lets you hold things in focus.

Always keep safe driving within your sight.

Fraternities ready for Saturday

 

By Greg Ossi
Staff Reporter

 

Traditions run deep at Wash-
ington and Lee and one of our
more festive ones is the big bash
of Fancy Dress.

Fraternities play a big part in
this occasion usually having
several parties of their own. The
fun usually starts Friday after-
noon with some sort of cocktail
or imported beer party. Then
there is the ball. Afterwards it
may be back to the house for a
champagne party.

Saturday afternoon is still
rocking with cocktail parties and
bands keeping things live. Sat-
urday night sees another band.
Most of these parties are closed

The Policeman

 

By Joel Miller
Staff Reporter

 

The Lexington Police De-
partment intends to crack down
on Washington and Lee Univer-
sity students who are driving
drunk during their annual Fancy
Dress Weekend (March 3-5),
according to a police official.

Police Lt. Steven E. Crowder
said extra officers will be pa-
trolling the Lexington area
throughout the weekend.

‘“‘We plan to concentrate
mainly on disorderly people be-
cause they are usually the ones
invoved in drunk-driving acci-
dents,’’ he said. ‘‘We also will
be concentrating on people who
are drunk in public,’’ he added.

Crowder said that student
arrest rates have been on the de-
crease in past years because of

is your

 

Virginia’s stricter drunk- driving
\aws. He said that students who
intend to drink should ask a
friend who will be sober to drive
them to and from the Fancy
Dress Ball itself and from the
various parties around the cam-
pus.

He added that the officers are
not instructed to be unduly harsh
when dealing with students.
‘‘We are strictly told to treat
them fairly and to assist them in
any way we can,”” he said.

And don’t be afraid to ask a
police officer to drive you home.
Crowder said he could recall
some instances when ‘“‘some
students were ‘taxied’ home by
an officer because they asked
and they were so drunk they
could hardly stand up to save
their lives,’’ which if you think
about it, is exactly what the
police officer did.

 

Your friend will be driving this.

With Fancy Dress rapidly ap-
proaching W&L security is look-
ing forward to an uneventful
weekend. As they prepare for
the ball, so can the student.

From past experience, the two
biggest security problems have
been lost coats and parking. Be-
cause coat checking is student
run there is only so much secur-
ity can do to help. The problem
with parking is not that there
isn’t any, but rather everyone
wants to park next to the gym
which is impossible. An alter-
nate nearby spot which will be lit
is the old freshman parking lot
on the other side of Route 60.

   

WA&L Security says parking will be a problem at the ball.

d Answers with

Fancy Dress Chairman Tom O’Brien

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

1. How did you get to be the
Chairman of Fancy Dress?

The Chairman of Fancy Dress
is a position that is appointed by
the Executive Committee. The
outgoing SAB Board of Direc-
tors also makes its recom-
mendations to the E.C. After all
factors and candidates are re-
viewed, a Chairman is chosen.

 

Tom O’Brien

2. What are your actual re-
sponsibilities as Fancy Dress
Chairman?

My responsibilities include
planning the budget, ordering
the materials, planning the room
designs and decorations and per-
haps the most tasking job of all,

 

Love Tractor rolls into Lexington

 

x

managing a group of 100 SAB
members. Above all else, I am
responsible for ensuring that the
Student Body enjoy themselves
at the Ball.

3. How much money is being
spent on this year’s ball?

Our budget based on projected
costs is $68,000.

4. How many hours of work
from how many people will go
in to this year’s ball?

Each SAB member will be ex-
pected to work at least 20 hours
in preparation for Fancy Dress.
The SAB board of directors have
already put in countless hours.

5. How difficult was it to get
the bands hired for FD?

It was very difficult because
no one would commit to coming.
We had bids in on 10,000
Maniacs, Echo & the Bunny-
men, and lots of others but they
wouldn’t commit. We almost
had Guadalcanal Diary but they
canceled too. If a band is not
already playing in this area it’s
tough to get them to come. We
did the best we could.

6. Was it especially hard to
get Glenn Miller?

No, because we planned way
in advance. Swing bands are ea-
sier to get because they don’t
have the travel schedule that a

rock band does.
7. What will be different
about this year’s ball?
Themewise, the ball is

centered in the United States in a
particular era and place unlike
themes of the recent past. The
theme also takes place in a his-
torical part of the country.

8. How did you come up with
the theme?

This year’s theme was chosen
because of its many possibilities

ioe

ie ;
ie

a

ee

and its ties to W&L history. We
figured that the Student Body
would enjoy this type of theme.
THE RECONCILIATION
BALL was chosen because of
the possibility of bringing back
the tradition of costumes. The
SAB wants this theme to bring
people together and to eliminate
any regional or racial conflicts
which marred the civil war
years.

9. What were some of the
other suggestions?

Many good suggestions were
presented to the SAB. Several
ideas revolved around the
1920's, including ‘‘Prohibition’’
and ‘‘Casino’’ or ‘‘Monte
Carlo.’’ ‘‘Down Under in Aus-
trailia’’ was popular but we wan-
ted to stay away from the place-
oriented themes of the past three
years. ‘‘Playboy Mansion’’ and
*‘Disneyland’’ were a couple
other suggestions.

10. Who came up with the
decoration ideas?

The decoration ideas were
formulated by Liz Smith, Lucy
Anderson and myself although
we did have many good sugges-
tions from other people. We
spent many hours of careful
preparation to come up with the
best decorations for the best
price.

11. Where does the money
for the ball come from?

Fancy Dress pays for itself
through ticket and concession
sales. We budget a set amount
based on what we can expect to
bring in by way of receipts. SAB
money, which is budgeted by the
E.C., is not used for Fancy
Dress.

12. What is the most exciting
thing about this year’s ball?

The revival of the costumes
and the relevance of the theme to
Washington and Lee history.

13. Any animals this year?

No. This year we decided that
animals weren't a visible and
necessary element for the theme,
as they were for last year’s THE
DARK CONTINENT. Our vis-
ual effects this year will be the
carriages and gazebo.

14. Has the administration
raised any questions concern-
ing the theme?

Yes, a few questions have
been raised about the nature of
the theme but we explained to
the administration that the theme
was chosen because of its histor-
ical relevance and significance to
Washington and Lee and not be-
cause of any racial or ethnic fac-
tor. Several members of the ad-
ministration expressed their
concerns about the theme being
potentially explosive racially and
politically. We maintain that
Fancy Dress is a social event and
not a political one. Our largest
concern is that everyone have a
happy, safe and memorable
Fancy Dress.

15. How long will the ball
last?

8:30 p.m. - 1 a.m.

16. When did you start
planning the ball?

Preliminary planning for the
ball began back in October, alth-
ough we didn’t finalize the
theme until early in January.
Certian basic decorations can
apply to all themes, but the
majority were ordered in Jan-
uary.

17. Will we be having a fire-
works display this year?

Yes, we're bringing back
fireworks. If the weather is

good, they will be shot from the
track at Wilson Field. If the
weather is poor they will be shot
from the field at the law school.
This year there will be two
shows. A small show will kick
off the ball around 8:30, and
then a much larger show will go
off later that evening after the
ball.

18. Where will everything be
located at the ball?

The layout will be basically
the same as it has been in years
past. The swing band will be in
the Warner Center and the rock
bands will be in Doremus.

19. What’s been the hardest

thing about managing Fancy
Dress?

The hardest thing has been
ironing out the fine details to
make sure everything goes
smoothly, so that both students
and administrators understand
the theme and are in no way
offended. The most important
thing is ensuring that everyone
has a good time.

20. What’s the one thing you
want the W&L community to
know about this year’s Fancy
Dress Ball?

The most important thing for
people to remember is that
Fancy Dress is a social event,
not a political one. This year’s
theme was chosen because of its
historical signigicance; especial-
ly here at W&L with Robert E.
Lee playing such an integral part
in the Civil War. The SAB’s
goal is to foster a feeling of
unity, hence, THE RECON-
CILIATION BALL and not to
amplify any regional or ethnic
conflicts. In essence, we hope
that everyone will have a happy
and memorable Fancy Dress.

 

 

Love Tractor from Athens, Ga. will headline Thursday nights show.

Words in Edgewise

 

In Search Of...the Fancy Dress Experience

 

By Marshall Boswell
Staff Reporter

 

Some stories just seem to stick
in your head. Here’s one of
mine, for instance.

When I was about ten-years-
old, a friend of mine got a brand
new bike. Beautiful. This was
before the day of BMX, knobby-
tired racing vehicles; no, my
friend’s bicycle was a sleek,
gorgeous Schwinn Sting
Ray—blue with a cream-colored
‘“‘banana’’ seat and high sissy
bar. It looked just like the
coolest, motorless chopper my
ten year old imagination could
have dreamt up. I longed to take
it out for a ride, give it a wheely
test, try it out on one of my
homemade ramps. So I tried out
the sure-fire euphamism every
ten-year-old kid employs in des-
perate times like these: ‘‘Hey,
think I can see it for a second?”’
See it, hell: I wanted to fly to
heaven on it.

But my friend would have
nothing doing. ‘‘It’s my new
bike and my dad said no one else
but me can ride it.’’ Oh, horror.
His dad.

 

 

So, instead he took me around
the neighborhood by letting me
balance my ten-year-old frame
on the brand new chrome handle
bars. It was dangerous, sure, but
when you’re ten, it’s only fun if
there’s threat of bodily injury.
And I'll never forget what he
said to me:

**Hey, Marshall. Try not to
bend the handle bars.’’ What did
he want me to do? Try to be
lighter? Concentrate on not
bending his handle bars while I
was sitting pecariously on them?
The whole matter was absurd:
either they were going to bend or
they were not. I couldn’t very
well force the issue.

I think of this story everytime
someone says to me, ‘‘Hey, try
not to think about how cold it
is.”’ But it is cold! Or: ‘‘Don’t
catch a cold.”’ It’s crazy.

Or how about this one: ‘‘Just
try and have a good time.”’
There is no logic in the statement
whatsoever. If someone has to
remind me to have a good time,
then it is obvious that for some
reason I am not enjoying myself.
And if I do end up having a good

time, it will be precisly because I
stopped tryingto do anything,
but instead just gave in to what
was going on.

I've filled two screens on my
word processor and still haven't
gotton to the point of this piece,
and I apologize. Anyway, at
long last, here it is: at Fancy
Dress this year, please don’t try
to have a good time, because,
given the above twisted logic, if
you have to make an effort, then
it is obvious that you are having
a miserable time to begin with.
It’s just like balancing on those
handle bars: you can’t try to
bend them and you can’t try not
to bend them; what happens is
what’s going to happen.

Trying too hard is the number
one reason most people have
such a miserable time at F.D.
Ever gone to a party where alco-
hol is in nearly unlimited supply
and decide before hand that
you're going to have a REALLY
GOOD OLD TIME (in all caps,
just like that)? What happens?
You wake up the next morning
in the same clothes, with myster-
ious mud on your cheek and a
headache that feels like someone

4

 

hand-screwed a rusty car axle
into your skull. That‘s what
happens when you try too hard
to have a good time.

Or let’s address the F.D. Date
Syndrome. Desperately, you as-
ked this girl / guy at the Cockpit
on the Wednesday night prior to
the Big Day. How well do you
know this person? What is her
/his last name? You've forgot-
ten? Or did you ever even know
it? And you’re going to tell me
you plan to spend a fun-filled
THREE DAYS WITH THIS
PERSON? Please. It will take
exactly one evening—Thursday
night, let’s say, en route to the
pavillion—to exhaust the entire
list of conversation topics you
drew up in Accounting class
Thursday morning. Then what?
Aha... you tried too hard, see?

How do you not try too hard?
Well, if you have a date with
whom you might not be rela-
tively comfortable, don’t plan
anything. Not even dinner. Part
of the fun, excitement, and topic
of conversation will be trying to
figure out where to go next.
Someone might benevolently

ia

and drunkenly invite you over to
dinner, maybe give up a couch,
or perhaps move into your hotel
room. And don’t drive any-
where—STAY OFF THE
ROAD PLEASE—but instead
try crashing where you drop. Let
it happen and ride out the whole
experience to see what lies on
the other side. You’ re in college.
Don’t worry about it.

And if you still insist on trying
to have aREALLY GOOD OLD
TIME this weekend, as indicated
previously, it might behoove you
to know that a certain biology
major informed me that taking
vitamin B before drinking helps
your body absorb alcohol with-
out diminishing the effects.
Something like that. Apparently,
the. enzyme in the body that
breaks down drinking alcohol
gets used up, leaving you dehy-
drated and feeling like there is a
sock on every tooth the next
morning; but vitamin B causes
your body to produce more of
this wonderful enzyme, so you
don’t use it all up in the course of
the night. Neat, huh? And to
think you balked at the science
requirement.

Seven candidates
run for Big Three

 

By Wendy Wolford
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

 

 

 

The seven candidates running
for Big Three offices are: (top
row, left to right) for president:
Christopher de Movellan, Matt
Bryant; for vice-president: Chris
Giblin, Hugh Finklestein; (bottom
row, I-r) for secretary: David
Grove, Edward Yu, and Alston
Parker.

 

 

Although Lee Chapel was not full
on Tuesday, March 1, the seven can-
didates for the Big Three elections
launched their campaigns in an open
forum. Under the direction of EC
President Brad Root, the candidates
presented their platforms and an-
swered questions concerning current
issues and their possible positions.

Presidential candidate Matt Bryant,
a junior, opened the proceedings with
his speech. He said served on the EC
his freshman and sophomore years,
and thinks he has the ability to execute
the office well. Due to his in-
volvement in the 1988 Mock Demo-
cratic Convention, he says he did not
run for re-election this year but thinks
he has gained valuable administrative
knowledge from his involvement with
the Mock Convention.

Junior Christopher de Movellan

says he gained experience during his
sophomore and junior years on the
EC. In his past year with the EC, de
Movellan thinks he has _ learned
enough about the EC’s proceedings to
serve as an effective president. His
says one of his goals will be to im-
prove student involvement in SAB
functions.

Both presidential candidates tou-
ched on the issue of confidentiality
concerning the closed trial proceed-
ings and said that preserving the
Honor System will be their main goal.
de Movellan added that he would like
to return the EC to it’s role as a fact-
finding body instead of a prosecuting
body in honor trials.

First-year law student Hugh Finkel-
stein said he stands on his background
as a W&L undergraduate and his past
year as an EC representative in run-
ning for vice-president. If elected,
Finkelstein said he plans to improve

From Staff Reports

 

W&L’s Mock Democratic Conven-
tion will not make its final prediction

, of the 1988 Democratic presidential
: nominee until March 26.

But after correctly predicting Ri-

' chard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis

as the winners of Iowa and New
Hampshire respectively, the Mock
Convention now turns its attention to

, Super Tuesday and the 20 states and

ee

1,307 Democratic delegates at stake in
the March 8 event.

Basing their predictions on the in-
formation being gathered by its
research staff of state and regional co-

' ordinators, the Mock Convention has

forecast that Massachusetts Governor
Michael Dukakis will win the primar-

’ ies in Florida, Maryland, Texas,

oe

Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Ok-
lahoma, as well as the caucuses in

” Hawaii and Washington.

a

tive Committee meeting.

Also, the EC decided to invite
members of the Student Affairs
Committee to meet with them and the
student body next Monday night.

With elections looming Monday,
and the run-off Thursday, candidates
for the office of EC president are
Matthew Bryant and Christopher
de Movellan.

Running for Vice-President are
Hugh Finkelstein and Christopher Gi-
blin.

Running for Secretary are David
Grove, Alston Parker, and Edward
¥u,

EC members proposed to meet with
SAC after receiving complaints from
the student body about recent SAC ac-

research.

Tennessee Senator Albert Gore,
who is hoping for a strong Super
Tuesday showing to boost his candi-
dacy will win in Arkansas, Idaho,
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Nevada.
Missouri Congressman Richard Ge-
phardt will win his home state.

Samuel K. Conner, chairman of the
credentials committee, comments
that, ‘Jackson will prove he’s a force
to be reckoned with by carrying
several Southern states. But the big
winner will be Dukakis because he
will again make a strong showing in
states outside his natural region. By
doing so, he will emerge as the front-
runner from Super Tuesday.”’

‘*Simon’s campaign will effectively
be crushed,’’ Conner added. ‘By net
running in the South, he denied him-
self the opportunity to continue as a
national candidate.”’

Chip Gist, political research chair-
man, commented that, ‘‘Jackson will
undoubtedly pick up a great deal of
delegates, as will Dukakis. The real
battle, however, will narrow down to
Gephardt versus Gore. Both have a
great deal to prove.”’

Washington and Lee’s Mock Con-

EC names candidates,

tions, particularly those regarding
fraternity Rush.

The meeting with SAC would be to
‘‘clear the air’’ about the recent SAC
actions.

EC President Brad Root said he
would try to get SAC to postpone their
final decision on Rush until next
week, so they could hear some of the
student concerns. EC Representative
Christopher de Movellan expressed a
desire for more openness in SAC ac-
tions.

SAC is composed completely of
members elected from the faculty and
administrators.

EC Representative Michael Suttle
said that he was concerned that some
of the members of SAC had no expe-
rience with fraternities and ‘‘wouldn’t
know what they were all about.”’

In other EC news, the EC discussed
two ongoing concerns: parking on
Washington Street and a coin machine
for the university laundry room under

MSA asks faculty support of boycott; SAB adjusts FD’s decorations

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-Editor

 

W&L’s Minority Student Association has
decided ‘‘by a majority vote’’ to boycott this
year’s Fancy Dress because the theme, ‘‘The
Reconciliation Ball of 1865,’’ celebrates a time
in which blacks had no rights, said Rosalyn

: Thompson, President of MSA.

MSA has sent a letter to the faculty asking
them to show its support by joining the boy-
cott. The MSA also plans to ask that in the fu-

ture the SAB get approval of the theme from

the deans.
For the SAB, ‘‘it’s full steam ahead,’’ said

_ Tom O'Brien, chairman of Fancy Dress.

‘‘Fancy Dress is a social event not a politi-
cal event. We respect their opinion and right

_ to boycott the ball. We're sorry they won't be

attending,’’ said O’Brien.
Thompson said, ‘“We feel that the SAB,

_ even if we hadn’t boycotted, had disinvited us

by choosing a theme and setting it in a period

' that we have nothing to celebrate about.’’

'

“It’s like having a Trail of Tears party and

inviting the Indians, or having a Third Reich
party and inviting the Jews. What would they
celebrate?

‘In 1865 in American History, it is the
exact year that they passed the black codes.
Ninety percent of the blacks lived in the
South. In the South they passed laws that said
blacks could not inter-marry, and blacks had
to live on a certain percentage of land. They
were reviving the old slave codes. So blacks
were not slaves, but they were treated as
slaves,’’ said Thompson, ‘*‘Between 1865 and
1866 the original KKK was formed in Tennes-
ioe.”
According to J. Holt Merchant, Professor
of History, reconstruction was a time in which
blacks were given some rights, ‘but not too
many rights that the elite whites had trouble ra-
ising a labor force.

“If there was a reconciliation, it didn’t
occur until quite late in the nineteenth century.
The symbolic event is the Spanish-American
war, where the southerners and northerners
joined together to beat up on the poor Span-
iards,’’ said Merchant.

‘*Essentially, northern whites said ‘we

value national unity more highly than we
value the protection of black rights’,’’ said
Merchant.

“It seems to me that in a progressive uni-
versity that you would opt for a theme that
wouldn't offend anyone,’’ Thompson said.

‘*The theme shows a lack of sensitivity, and
that’s something that education should give
you. I think that they [the SAB] need to ask
WA&L for a better education if they still can’t
understand why [we are offended by the
theme. ]”’

Thompson said she has received support
from the student body and said that many stu-
dents think ‘‘if we had just picked another
theme, then none of this would have hap-
pened.’* Several non-MSA students have also
told her that they intend to boycott, although
MSA has not asked the student body to join
the boycott.

‘**We’re not asking for a school-wide boy-
cott,"’ said Thompson, ‘‘We don’t want
Fancy Dress to fail. We think it’s something
important that this institution does.”’

MSA did send a letter to all faculty mem-
bers’ explaining their position and asking the

faculty to show their support by boycotting the
ball.

‘*I personally am going to boycott. I’ve tal-
ked to some faculty members who are also not
going,’ said Merchant.

‘I find myself in a peculiar position be-
cause I teach Southern History, | am South-
ern, and I value my past. On the other hand, I
don’t value all aspects of my past equally,’”
said Merchant, ‘‘This appears to be a celebra
tion of aspects of Southern history that I find
indefensible.

‘“‘T normally go to Fancy Dress. I’m dis
appointed I’m not going to hear Glenn Mil-
ler,’’ he said, *‘but I’m not.””

President John D. Wilson will attend.

‘I hope my attendance will not be con
strued as some vote for or against this issue
that divides us,’’ said Wilson. He said he will
attend the ball simply because it is a major
function of the university

MSA students say they want the theme to
gain approval from the deans

‘‘We want the university to set a policy
where the SAB will have to turn in the theme
early in order to get the deans approval so that

it will never go this far again,’’ said Thomp-
son.

‘That doesn’t mean it won’t be a secret. It
just means they will have approval and all this
will be avoided.”’

Currently, the SAB receives suggestions
from the Executive Committee and the deans,
but the final decision remains in the SAB’s
hands.

‘*From my perspective, the SAB was acting
in good faith and without malicious intent or
racial _motivation,’’ said Dean of Students
Lewis John.

‘| think after the fact, the fact being the de-
termination of the theme, the SAB has tried to
meet some of the objections that MSA has,
such as certain parts of the decorations,’’ said
John.

According to John, SAB officials approa-
ched John and Dean Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ At-
kins during the fall with several suggestions
for the theme. John said that he and Atkins
raised several concerns with the theme of
‘Reconciliation Ball of 1865,’’ including the

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, March 3, 1988

 

Help out

In the coming week, Washington and Lee students will have an
opportunity to help chart the course of the Honor System in the fu-
ture. The White Book Revisions Committee is beginning to gather
student opinion for their study of possible changes in the White
Book, which outlines the functioning of the Honor System. The im-
portance of the book is great; it guides our honorable conduct from
day to day. Therefore, the possibility of change in the system is an

extremely significant event.

The committee will be placing suggestion boxes at different
places on campus. They have guaranteed that all suggestions will be
kept confidential in order to collect true student opinion of the
Honor System. We encourage everyone to read their copy of the
White Book and submit any suggestions they may have. If one does
not think that the White Book should be changed, then one should
let the committee know. For those who do not have a copy of the
White Book, contact an Executive Committee member to find

where a copy can be obtained.

The committee is also holding an open honor forum on March 8
at 8 p.m. in Northen Auditorium. At this forum, the committee will
present the ideas they have received at that point, as well as take
suggestions from the audience. Again, we encourage everyone to
participate in this event. Without student interest the forum, and the
committee itself, can not be a success.

For those people who have expressed complaints about the Honor
System privately, now is the time to bring them into the open. The
current student generation is supposed to decide how the system
will work. If students just sit back and expect the revisions commit-
tee to do the work for them, nothing can be accomplished. Students
have to become involved now to insure the future.

Cobb questions the

Fancy Dress theme

 

MY VIEW
By Jimm Cobb

 

After reading the ‘‘Twenty Ques-
tions and Answers’’ column in the
F.D. supplement, I decided to ask the
student body for their opinions of this
article. The following responses refer
to specific questions and were given
by members of S.A.B., E.C., and the
general student population; and are a
mixture of direct quotes, ideas, and
overheard conversations.

Question 1: How do you think Tom
got to be Chairman of Fancy Dress?
Answers: ‘‘Well he probably begged,
grovelled, and pleaded for it.’’

“*T have no idea.”’

Question 2: What are Tom’s actual
F.D. responsibilities?

Answers: ‘‘Coming up with his own
ideas for F.D. and doing what he
wants; no matter what anyone says.
'**P_.-_.. people off.”’

Question 3: How well do you think he
used the money?

Answers: ‘‘I don’t know yet.”’

“*Well, he used it as a leverage to get
his theme approved. He was supposed
to bring the theme to the E.C. for ap-
proval before he spent any money, but
after not having a theme for a month
or so, he brought the theme before the
E.C. with money already spent on the
theme.”’

Question 5: How difficult do you
think it was to get the bands?

Answers: ‘‘There shouldn’t have been
any problem—have you heard of these
bands; they should pay us.’’

‘*The bands are the only thing going
fol.”

**How many times will ‘Love Tractor’
play here?”’

Question 7: What will be different
about this year?

Answers: ‘‘Well, as compared to last

“It’s childish.”’

‘‘Henry the VIII, Medieval, or some-

come from?

will lose a lot of money, the students’

‘*From all of the students who don’t
go.””

Question 12: What is the most excit-
ing thing about this year’s ball?
Answers: ‘I’m not going.”’

“UVA”

‘*The controversy.’’

Question 16: When do you think they
really started planning the ball?
Answers: ‘‘Sometime in Tom’s der-
anged childhood. ”’

‘*Well, he was supposed to have the
theme approved long ago, but the
E.C. only found out about it a week or
two before break. By then the S.A.B.
had already spent the money, and it
was too late to change the theme.”’

Well there you have a truer story; if
not, remember truth is stranger than
fiction.

I would like to applaud Tom for
making his name infamous in his
senior year, after so many years of
trying. Also, I want to know why he
went out on his own, against the E.C..,
and spent unapproved money. Finally,
I want to ask, Does a theme that has to
have excuses and explanations made
for it really have a place at W&L?

Evangelist saves souls through dirty ditty

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

Recently, I noticed thousands of
posters around the campus advertising
a speech on ‘‘Maximum Sex’’ to be
given by a person named ‘‘Josh,’’ I
immediately reasoned that Josh must
be a famous pornographic movie di-
rector who planned to show a sneak
preview of ‘‘Debbie Does Dallas, Part
Ill.” And, since I enjoyed Debbie
Does Dallas, Parts I & II so much, I
decided to attend.

It turns out Josh is a fire and brim-
stone evangelist and his speech had as
much to do with maximum sex as non-
alcoholic drinks do with fraternity par-
ties. For those of you who aren't
lucky enough to have spent a Friday
night listening to an evangelist, your
education is not complete. But don’t
worry, this article will fulfill your ed-
ucational needs. (Note: the author of
this article cannot fulfill his own edu-
cational needs, much less yours.)

Important Evangelical Facts

1) Evangelists do exist. (Many peo-
ple believe they were created by net-

work T.V. producers in the interest of
Sunday morning humor.)

2) Evangelists are always right.

3) Evangelists scream a lot.

4) Evangelists talk to God whenever
they feel like it.

The Reverend Josh’s main idea was
that God condemns adultery not be-
cause he doesn’t want you to have fun,
but because he wants to provide for
you and protect you from the draw-
backs of adultery and pornography.
To help those of you who are having
trouble with this abstract concept I
will give you a concrete example.

Scene 1: Josh is relaxing on the
couch reading The Daily Damnation
(his favorite newspaper) and writing
his four-hundred-twenty-first book
when he notices his son, Lazarus, has
a copy of the Sports Illustrated Swim
Suit Issue hidden in the Bible he is
supposed to be reading.

Josh: (screaming at the top of his
lungs) Lazarus! What magazine is
that!?

Lazarus: Gee Dad, it’s the Christian
Chronicle

Josh: No it’s not! It’s the Sports Il-
lustrated Swim Suit Issue and you're
looking at the topless blonde on page
24! I was forced to study every detail
of those pictures for the Church Cen-
sorship Committee. I hated every sec-

ond of it. (He picks up a 2 by 4 and
strikes Lazarus, knocking out his front
teeth.)

Lazarus: Dad, why are you hitting
me in the face with a 2 by 4?

Josh: I’m obligated to provide and
protect you from pornography.

After hearing Josh speak I believe
President Reagan should appoint him
as a Supreme Court Justice. The Su-
preme Court needs open-minded
judges like Josh.

Josh: (to the other judges) We will
outlaw adultery, pornography, ho-
mosexuals, Dr. Ruth, condoms, Bugs
Bunny, rated ‘*R’’ movies and ...

Other judges: But Josh, that would
violate seven amendments, court
precedent, and every civil right I can
think of.

Josh: | DON’T CARE! Do it NOW
or burn in hell.

If the Supreme Court doesn’t work
out Josh could always become Editor
of The Weekly World News or The
National Enquirer. (Important female
aesthetic tip: I recently read in one of
these magazines that sneezing in-
creases Bust Size)

One thing that impressed me about
Josh was his versatility. He lectures to
communist farmers, pre-school chil-
dren, the State Department, profes-
sors, college students, and anyone else

who will listen to him (not many peo-
ple fall into the last category, but who
am I to talk, not many people read,
these articles either.)

To give the reader a sense of Josh’s
versatility I will recreate a speech he ,
recently gave before ‘‘The Young
Poets of America Association:"*

“Brothers and Sisters, good even- ,
ing. When I told the Lord I was gonna
be lecturin’ to poets he helped write *
me a poem. Yes folks, the good Lord ,
likes poetry.

To the Editor:

I read with considerable disgust, though no sur-
prise, Rosalyn D. Thompson and the Minority
Student Association’s litany of whining in last
week’s Phi. Apparently this year’s Fancy Dress
theme does not meet with their approval. Alth-
ough I think this year’s theme is generally awk-
ward, silly, and unimaginative, it is hardly the
vicious insult to black students that the MSA
claims.

Miss Thompson chides the SAB by asking how
they expect black students to enjoy an FD with a
theme set in a period ‘‘when blacks were oppres-
sed.’’ The question makes the ridiculous assump-
tion that the SAB should make the enjoyment of a
small group of cranky radicals like MSA para-
mount to is FD theme criteria. In addition, the
MSA apparently feels that a theme set in such a
period is so evil that they must organize a boycott.
Are we to assume then that MSA would also find
unacceptable any theme pertaining to an era or
event which took place before, say, the 1964 Civil
Rights Act, since during such a period some
blacks, somewhere must have still been ‘‘oppres-

Miss Thompson goes even further, by denounc-
ing Washington and Lee as the most racist school
in the nation. The claim is almost too absurd to
address, given the numerous benefits W&L ex-
tends to blacks, including a Dean whose sole pur-
pose is to promote their interest. Surely Miss
Thompson owes the University an apology.

The recent hysterics surrounding off-the-cuff
remarks by Al Campanis and Jimmy ‘‘The
Greek’’ Snyder, not to mention the mindless rant-
ings of the Phi’s own sports editor on the subject,
illustrate how increasingly asinine the definition
of what is ‘‘racist’’ and ‘‘insulting to blacks’’ has
become. As the MSA’s actions prove, almost any-
thing at all relating to race, even in the most roun-
dabout way, will be denounced as racist.

Not everyone will be satisfied with any FD
theme. But immature reaction by self-important
interest groups does nothing to improve the Fancy
Dress tradition, nor does it seriously address the
question of race relations. The sad irony is that
many people at W&L are thrilled with MSA’s de-
cision to boycott.

To the Editors:

I write with utter disgust at the unfortunate
scenario which has developed in response to the
theme of the 1988 Fancy Dress Ball: The Recon-
ciliation Ball.

Fancy Dress and, in particular, this year’s
theme represent the pinnacle of unity at Washing-
ton and Lee. It is the only event in which Law
School and Undergrad, Faculty and Students,
Greek and Independent, North and South come
together as one in a night of revelry. Robert E.
Lee, our noble and revered father (or is he any-
more?), not only led forces under the flag of
Southern pride and tradition but also spent the last
five years of his life at this school working to rec-
oncile the North and the South. I am sure if the
great General were alive today that he would hear-
tily approve of this year’s theme.

I find the banning of the Confederate flag at an
event which stresses reconciliation abominable
especially at W&L which has so much Southern
tradition. The Confederate flag is abused by a few
as is the United States flag misused by some indi-
viduals.

I find the attitude of those few students of the
MSA childish but the encouragement by some
administrators deplorable. I am also exceedingly
disappointed in those administrators that have al-
lowed roughly a dozen people to hamper and ma-
nipulate the setting for 2500+ people. It is an in-
sult and a shame to the Student Activities Board
and especially the Fancy Dress Committee to en-
dure this treatment after so much hard work and
planning. I suppose winter has finally arrived in
hell now that General Lee’s college is too embar-
rassed, ashamed or spineless to hang the confed-

erate flag.

To the Editor: ~§

It’s a shame when an important segment of the
student body chooses to boycott an event as im-
portant to Washington and Lee University as the
Fancy Dress Ball, but to do so is certainly your
prerogative.

Why though? If I’m not mistaken, the end of the
Civil War signified a great step for black Ameri-
cans, a step towards freedom. You say that the
basis for your boycott is that the theme is ‘‘set in a
period in which blacks were oppressed,”’ but by
that basis couldn’t you conceivably be offended
by any American theme set in the nineteenth or
even much of the twentieth century? Furthermore,
to state that Washington and Lee is the most racist
in the country simply by virtue of an innocuous
party theme is incredibly off-base, not to mention
ridiculous and sad.

You’re quite right, though, that blacks contri-
bute a lot to W&L. You are very important to the
school. So is Fancy Dress. Your presence will be
missed there.

Have a nice weekend.

Dear Miss Thompson:

As a member of ‘‘the fraternity’ of which you
made reference to in last week’s edition of the
Ring-tum Phi, I would cordially like to extend to
you an invitation to accompany me to this year’s
Old South Ball.

Fraternally,

William I. Crabill *89

P.S.—Do you think that you can find a hoop skirt
large enough to clothe your predjudices?

To the Editors:

As the founder and president of the newly
formed ‘‘Northerners cutting off their noses to
spite their faces association’’ it is my responsibi-
lity to express our anger at the rumor that the dec-
orations for Fancy Dress are 51 percent Southern
and 49 percent Northern. Regardless of who our
dates are or how good the band is, we cannot pos-
sibly enjoy ourselves at this ‘Old South’’ ball and
thus we are boycotting.

Thanks for PUSH help

The University Community:

The Brothers of Pi Kappa Phi would like to
thank the SAB, the Ring-tum Phi and all those
who participated in the three-on- three tournament
this past Sunday. The event was a tremendous
success, raising $450 for PUSH (our national
fraternity’s charity). In addition, the day produced
some exciting basketball as the Championship
Game went into triple overtime with the team of
Range/Anderson/Hawkins (West Regional
Champs) pulling out a 25-23 heart-stopper over
the Southeast Champs Hart/Gallivan/‘‘Pollock.”’
In other action, the East Regional Champs Aber-
nathy/Barton/Milling took third place over the
Midwest Regional Champs Dur-
ant/Gilbert/Martin, rounding out the Final Four.

Next year we hope to expand the tournament to

, 4 three-point shootout and a women’s bracket as

a field of sixty-four teams! Also, we hope to have

well. Thanks again for your support. We'll see
you next year on the ‘‘Road to Lexington.”’

Sincerely,

Gaines misunderstanding |

To the Editor:

The article on law students in Gaines Hall in
your last issue was missing some important facts. |*
The Phi reported that ‘‘a misunderstanding appar-
ently occurred between Washington Hall and the
Law School’’ concerning housing policy on
Gaines Hall. This is wrong because there was |*
first, a misperceptionof*policy in Washington
Hall and second, almost zero communication
from Washington Hall to the Law School regard-
ing the housing policy. ‘

There was no misunderstanding between the
Law School and the administration. The fault lay
entirely with the administration in Washington
Hall. Dean Ruscio believed that the policy to ex-
clude law students from Gaines Hall had been in
place before he became dean. He therefore turned p
away all law student inquiries about Gaines Hall.
In an interview with second year E.C. Rep. Dave
Nave and the Law News, Ruscio admitted that [s
even if law students had applied before the dead-
line, they would not have been allowed in Gaines
Hall. Clearly this inaccurate statement of policy
originated in the administration and not in the law
school as was implied by last week’s article.

Dean John admitted in an interview last week |¢
with the Law News that there was a lack of com-
munication between himself and Dean Ruscio on
the subject of law student housing in Gaines Hall. |«
John stated that Gaines had always been viewed as
an undergraduate housing facility. Dean John got
the impression that law students wanted to live
away from undergrads in Gaines Hall next year,
in large part because he received no information
about law student interest in Gaines. This
strengthened his view of Gaines as a purely
undergraduate housing facility.

However, the perception of law student’s lack
of interest originated in the failure of the adminis-
tration to communicate with the law school about
the housing policy. No one was ever asked what
law students’ needs were. Even Frederic Kirgis,
Dean of the Law School, was not told about the
housing policy until questioned by the Law News.
A second breakdown of communication extended
to the failure to send notices or housing applica-
tions directly to law students as had been the cus-
tom in the past. Instead, applications were left in
an obscure location and went almost unnoticed
from November until after the deadline in Jan-
uary. That is the fault of the sender.

Dave Nave deserves some credit for clearing up
this situation. After Nave brought the policy to. the
attention of the E.C. and the E.C. notified Presi-
dent Wilson and Dean John, the situation was
remedied in one afternoon. I must compliment the
administration for the speed and effort that was
exerted to clear up their mistake. The administra-
tion also plans to conduct a housing survey of law
students similar to the extensive survey of under-
graduates a few years ago. However, since many
law students were turned away by Dean Ruscio’s
office, few law students will live in Gaines next
year and law students living on campus will be
housed in their own dorm.

Unlike other law schools at larger universities
in larger cities, W&L’s law school must depend
upon the university for extracurricular and social
activities—this includes housing. More important
is the realization that law students at W&L are a
more significant part of the university than they
are at other law schools. Law students make up an
integral part in the Honor System and are involved
in almost every other activity on campus. I hope
that the housing policy will not lead to a division
of the university.

White Book revisions

On February 22, 1988 the Executive Committee
formally selected and charged the White Book
Revisions Committee. The charge to this commit-
tee is to examine the philosophy and procedure of
the present ‘‘Honor System’ as set forth in the
White Book, in relation to the present university

This committee will be actively seeking from
the Washington and Lee Community (students,
faculty, and administration) your opinion as to
whether the ‘‘Honor System’’ as presently im-
plemented by the White Book should be revised,

The White Book states clearly that our honor
system ‘‘is based upon the principle of mutual
trust’’ which enables this the value of the philo-
sophical and moral principles upon which our
honor system has developed. However, systems
that govern human interaction need to be flexible
to rapidly changing environments, while still re-
taining the principles upon which they are foun-
ded. With these thoughts in mind, this committee
urges all members of the Washington and Lee
community to become involved in this examina-

The Executive Committee appointed thirteen
members of the student body to this committee to

gather the opinion of the community, and to then
present to the Executive Committee it’s recom-
mendations. To facilitate the gathering commun-
ity opinion, the White Book Revisions Committee
will place suggestion boxes in the Co-op, the
undergraduate library, and the ARA lounge of the
law school. All written suggestions offered to the
committee will be kept fully confidential, so as to
encourage an open and candid exchange of ideas.

In addition, the committee is planning an Open
Forum to facilitate discussion about the Honor
System and gain further insight into the communi-
ty’s perspective of the system’s philosophy and
procedure. Through this forum the committee will
present a summary of proposed revisions and then
open discussion to all interested members of the
Washington and Lee community. The forum will
be held March 9, 1988 at 7-9 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Recognizing that many Alumni will be return-

Senior’s time
for pictures

running short

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

For the past few months now, the
sign-up sheet in the Co-op for senior
class pictures has remained blank.
Only within the last week have three
or four groups signed up to have their
senior group pictures taken. For the
rest, time is running out.

Apparently, the general impression
is that the pictures will not be taken
until sometime Spring Term, so peo-
ple think they have plenty of time. In
fact the pictures may have to be taken
by the end of Winter Term, leaving
the seniors barely five weeks to have
their picture taken.

There is no guarantee that photog-
rapher Patrick Hinely: will be able to
take pictures as late as Spring Term,
according to’ Courtney Harpold.
Hinely is signed up to take pictures no
later than March 25; his schedule after
that is indefinite.

‘If these people just blow it off un-
til Spring Term, they may not have a
chance,”’ said Harpold.

The longer the seniors wait, Har-
pold added, the less time there will be
available to reschedule another time in
case the weather turns bad on the set
date. This goes for fraternity group
pictures as well.

There is an alternative. Seniors may
get together and take their own group
pictures themselves, if they feel that
signing up with the professional pho-
tographer is too much of a burden.
While Hinely’s camera will be
able to take in a broader picture with
perhaps finer quality, there is nothing
wrong, says Harpold, with taking
your senior picture yourself.

Just be sure to have it labeled, with
each person’s name and class, in the
order according to their positions in
the picture. Then take it to the Calyx
office upstairs in the University
Center.

For those seniors who would prefer
to have their picture taken profession-
ally, they are advised to sign up as
soon as possible on the sheet posted
behind the candy/snack shelves in the
Co-op. If they wait much longer they
may not have any senior group pic-
tures in next year’s Calyx at all.

Philosophy
lecture held

_ From Staff Reports

 

Georges Rey, professor of philoso-
phy at the University of Maryland,
will deliver two lectures at W&L
Wednesday and Thursday, March 9
and 10. Both lectures are open to the
public.

‘*How to Make a Mind,”’ is the to-
pic of Rey’s first lecture, which he
will present Wednesday at 8 p.m. in
Room 9 of Newcomb Hall. On Thurs-
day at 3 p.m. he will speak on ‘*Sensa-
tional Sentences’ in Room 318 of
Tucker Hall. Rey will also be meeting
with students during his two-day visit
to the campus.

Rey’s interests are in philosophy of
mind, computationalism, and artificial
intelligence. He received his B.A.
from the University of California at
Berkeley, and his Ph.D. from Har-
vard.

W&L’s Cognitive Science Commit-
tee is sponsoring Rey’s visit to the
campus.

the allocation of funds to different
campus organizations. He also thinks
his experience as a law student is im-
portant as the vice-president is the
EC’s technical advisor in both open
and closed hearings.

 

Sophomore Chris Giblin said he
takes pride in his belief in the Honor
System and his experience as an EC
representative this year. Like Finkel-
stein, Giblin said he is concerned with
the budget, especially during Mock
Convention years. He also said he
‘twould serve as a liaison between the
students and the administration.’’

Juniors David Grove, Alston Par-
ker, and Edward Yu are vying for EC
Secretary. Grove began his speech

stating the importance of involvement
in campus activities. He thinks activi-
ties provide a ‘‘network of communi-
cation’ necessary for representing the
student body.

Parker said she thinks involvement
in extracurricular activities is impor-
tant to the position of secretary. She
said she will rely on a ‘*good working
knowledge of the campus’”’ as qualifi-
cation for the job.

Yu said one of his main goals is to
work as a team with the president and
vice-president for a successful EC. He
thinks he not only has an obligation to
serve the W&L student body but also
the Honor System itself.

The elections will be held on Mon-
day, March 7. Finkelstein said it is
important for all of the student body to
vote in order to make the Honor
System work. The elections on Mon-
day will be followed by the run-off
elections on Thursday, March 10.

concern that the theme has racial over-

Thompson said several friends on
the SAB told her of the theme when
she returned to school after February
break. After confirming the theme,
she said she tried to contact O’Brien
several times. However, the SAB was
unable to meet with MSA until Wed-
nesday, Feb. 24, said Thompson.

Liz Smith, a member of the SAB,
met with MSA officials Wednesday
afternoon and the MSA held an emer-
gency meeting Wednesday night to
vote on the issue, said Thompson.

Anece McCloud, Associate Dean of
Students, said, ‘Liz Smith contacted
me after she heard of the possibility
that the minority students may want to
boycott. She came in and was very
sincere in her efforts to determine if
there was anything at all that could be
done that could turn the decision
around.”’

McCloud said the SAB was willing
to make several specific concessions
including cancelling the SAB orders
for costumes, not displaying the con-

Parade to highlight convention;
entire community will be included

 

From Staff Reports

 

One of the highlights of the 1988
W&L Mock Democratic Convention
will be a parade through Lexington on
March 25.

Plans are already well under way to
ensure that the entire area is rep-
resented in the event.

Rick Clawson, a W&L senior and
Co-chairman of the Parade Commit-
tee, said that the parade is one of the
best ways to bring Rockbridge
County, the City of Lexington, and
W&L together.

‘*The parade features many of the
area’s outstanding bands and march-
ing units,** said Clawson. ‘‘We’ve
met with a large number of commun-
ity business and educational leaders to
obtain their suggestions. Their ideas
have been very helpful towards our
planning.”’

While many of the details have
already been completed, the Parade
Committee wishes to emphasize that it
is continuing to take applications from
all groups and organizations interested
in participating in the event, said
Frank Kannapell, also a senior and the
parade’s other chairman.

‘*We’ve had an excellent response
so far,‘‘ said Kannapell. ‘‘But we
want to make sure that everyone has

EC forms committee

to study honor revisions

From Staff Reports

The 1988 White Book Revisions
Committee is sponsoring an open
forum for the university commun-
ity—students, faculty, and administra-
tion—to discuss the state of the Honor
System and any suggested changes in
the White Book.

The forum will be held March 9
from 7 to 9 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

The 13 members of the committee
were appointed by the Executive
Committee of the student body to
gauge the current student body opin-
ion of the Honor System and to rec-
ommend suggested changes in the
White Book.

**The committee members realized
that one method of determining stu-
dent opinion was to have an open
meeting, at which any student could
come forward with ideas for improv-
ing the White Book,”” said John Falk,
co-chairman of the committee.

‘*We’ve already received sugges-
tions from students and committee
members about possible changes in
the White Book,”’ Falk said. ‘‘But we
want to be sure we allow the entire
W&L community the opportunity to
be heard.”’

The first part of the forum will al-
low the White Book Revisions Com-

 

mittee to state their purpose and to
summarize some of the changes which
have been proposed.

Following that, discussion will be
opened to those in attendance.

The White Book pamphlet sets out
the procedures and guidelines of the
Washington and Lee University
Honor System. The current Honor
System has its roots in the policies set
by Gen. Robert E. Lee when he be-
came president of Washington Col-
lege in 1865. He did away with the
rulebook which was then in existence
and asked only that students behave as
gentlemen, and that they not lie, cheat
or steal.

The earliest dated White Book in the
University Library Special Collec-
tions was prepared by the 1968-69
Executive Committee. This four-by-
five inch, 19-page booklet set out
many procedural rules which form the
basic structure of the system as it
exists now.

Revisions committees have been
formed every four or five years during
the past two decades, according to EC
president Brad Root.

The current revisions committee
was appointed in February and will
present its suggestions to the Execu-
tive Committee for approval at the be-
ginning of Spring Term.

 

an opportunity to participate. The par-
ade only happens once every four
years.””

Kannapell also said the Parade
Committee would like to borrow or
rent flatbed trailers from some of the
area’s farmers for use as floats by the
state delegations.

Clawson and Kannapell said that
anyone with a trailer or with an inter-
est in participating in the parade may
contact them by sending the informa-
tion to: Parade Committee, W&L
Mock Convention, PO Box 1559,
Lexington, VA 24450, or by calling
the Mock Convention office at
463-8579.

federate flag, and not using a planta-
tion scene as a decoration.

According to O’Brien, the SAB has
made these changes to the decorations
despite the MSA boycott.

McCloud, John and Wilson all
agree that the suggestion that the
deans have approval of the theme is
not the best solution to the problem.

‘The structure at Washington and
Lee is one that gives the student max-
imum autonomy, especially in terms
of student activities,’’ said McCloud.

‘I do not really think that the ad-
ministration will elect to dictate to the
Student Activities Board what themes
it can or can not use.’’

McCloud suggested that a member
of the MSA, in addition to any minor-
ity students who are already members
of the SAB, be appointed to the SAB
each year to preclude a similar situa-
tion from occurring.

O’Brien said that no minority mem-
bers applied to become a member of
the SAB last year.

Despite the boycott, several mem-
bers of MSA plan to attend Fancy
Dress.

Richard Bayton, a member of MSA,
said ‘‘it must be a personal choice.”
Bayton says he supports the MSA’s

right to boycott, but plans to go ‘‘be-
cause the overall theme itself is not
offensive to me.”’

‘The idea of theme itself was stupid
and ill thought-out,’’ said Bayton, and
thinks that the SAB didn’t consider all
of the possible ramifications of the
theme that other MSA members find
more offensive.

Bayton said that the MSA’s vote to
boycott the ball was ‘‘a majority vote,
but not a unanimous vote.”

**Many of us feel like we are betray-
ing the MSA, but, at the same time,
we can’t betray our personal feelings.

**W&L is not the most racist college
in the South. Like all colleges, W&L
has some sectors of racism. But it’s
wrong to slander the many just to get a
few,”’ said Bayton.

“‘It should be up to each individual
as to whether or not it bothers him and
whether or not he wants to go,’’ he
said.

Wilson stressed that he hopes some-
thing positive will come out of the
boycott and theme controversy. He
hopes that W&L students will become

more sensitive to issues that may have
racial overtones.

“‘T hope we can learn from it. I think
we have already learned from it.’’

Soviets to study at W&L

By Andy Nixon
Staff Reporter

 

Through participation in a new
international collegiate exchange pro-
gram, three students from the Soviet
Union will enroll at W&L next year.

This new exchange comes through
the efforts of a consortium of small
liberal arts colleges, mostly located in
the Northern United States.

In its first year, the consortium ini-
tiated the idea of Soviet students
travelling to the United States to
study. Upon hearing of the program,
W&L contacted the group, expressed
interest in participating, and now will
receive three Soviet students.

W&L is the only southern college
participating and is also receiving the
most students from the Soviet Union
out of all the other colleges.

The goal of the program, according
to Professor Bidlack, who heads the
program, ‘‘is to integrate the students
as fully as possible.’’ As of now the
University has no idea who the stu-
dents are. This is left to the agency
coordinating the trip within the Soviet
Union, but certain elements of their
stay are currently known.

The students will live on campus
with American students, rather than
with each other. The students are
already enrolled in Soviet universities
and will enter as juniors here at W&L.
Regarding their curriculum, one-half
of the courses they select must be in
the liberal arts. They must take one
computer course, and the rest is up to
them. They can compete in any sports
or other extra-curricular activities
they wish.

As a result of participation in this
program, three to six students from
W&L will have the opportunity to
spend either a semester or year in the
Soviet Union during the 1989-1990
academic year. Details of this pro-
gram are as of yet unavailable.
Anyone wishing information or poten-
tial requirements of this counter-
exchange program should contact
Professor Bidlack of the history de-
partment.

The exchange of faculty and indivi-
dual experts between the United States
and the Soviet Union has existed since
the late 1950s, but this exchange is the
first program involving undergra-
duates, or in the words of Professor
Bidlack, ‘‘students just beginning
their academic initiative.’’

Coming off an 11-4 season in
which they reached the national
semifinals, the Washington and
Lee lacrosse Generals have come
together well during the pre-
season, according to head coach
Dennis Daly.

After a demanding exhibition
schedule that included scrimmages
against North Carolina, Duke,
Jacksonville and Mount Washing-
ton, Daly said he is pleased with
how his team is progressing.

‘*We’re not at a bad place, ’’ he
said.‘‘We'’re probably _ farther
along than we were at this point
last year.”’

Checking the W&L lineup, the
1988 roster features 23 returning
lettermen, including junior attack-
man John Ware, a second-team all-
America selection last season, and
sophomore defender Reid Camp-
bell, the nation’s only freshman to
earn all-America honors in 1987.

The Generals plan to stick with
the fast-break offense and aggres-
sive defense that earned them the
top spot in the Division-HI rank-
ings for much of the ‘87 season.

Sophomore David Olson, who had
previously qualified for the NCAAs,
was named Swimmer-of-the-Meet for
his sterling performance, which in-

200-yard individual medley, 1:54.28;
100-yard back, 53.9; and 200-yard
back, 1:54.12.

Junior Jeff Bercaw became the fifth
member of the men’s team to qualify
for the NCAAs. The others are: junior
Moose Herring and sophomores
Adam Morgan and Shawn Copeland.

The Generals also qualified their four
relay teams.

““We had a lot of fun and made a lot
of friends at that meet,”’ said head
coach Page Remillard. ‘*I am proud of
the way we swam, including some
swimmers who didn’t qualify for the
nationals. [Senior] Simon Perez, and |
juniors] David Reavy and David Dietz
had personal bests and just missed
qualifying.”’

Fifth straight conference title for Generals

Led by senior Andrew White, the
W&L track team captured the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference indoor
title for the fifth straight time Satur-
day, blowing away the competition
and scoring more points than any
other team in ODAC history.

After the meet, White was named
the 1988 ODAC Runner-of-the-Year
in indoor track by the conference coa-
ches, and W&L head coach Norris
Aldridge was named _ conference
Coach-of-the-Y ear.

The Generals dominated the meet
throughout, placing first or second in
12 of the day’s 14 events. W&L ath-
letes won seven events and set three
conference records.

‘Washington and Lee’s total of 165
points was more than enough, as the
122 points scored by Lynchburg Col-
lege left the Hornets a distant second.

White was expected to be the Gen-
erals’ leader, and the 1987 Runner-
of-the-Year in indoor and outdoor
track did not disappoint. He set a con-
ference record in the 55-meter high
hurdle preliminaries, smoking the
competition in 7.7 seconds. In the fin-

The women’s team will send junior

pionships, which will be held today
through Saturday in Atlanta.

Tennis drops two in slow start

 

From Staff Reports

 

The W&L men’s tennis team got off
to a tough start; idsing two matches
and winning one in its first week of the
season.

The Generals dropped a 5-3 de-
cision to Penn State at home last Fri-
day and then lost their second match
8-1 at William and Mary on Saturday.
The team bounced back on Tuesday
with a 5-4 win over James Madison in
Lexington.

The main highlight of the first three
matches was the play of sophomore
John Morris. Playing out of the No. 4
singles slot, Morris did not lose any of
his three singles matches. That leaves
Morris’ record for the 1987-88 season
unblemished, as he went undefeated in
the fall season.

The Generals entered the 1988
spring season with great expectations.

W&L, ranked No. 1 in the presea-
son national Division III Intercolle-
giate Tennis Coaches’ Association
(ITCA) poll, return five of six players
from last year’s team, which finished
second in the NCAA Championships
for the second straight year. Four of
those players have already earned all-

doubt be led by Ware, the team’s
points leader in 1987. Joining
Ware on Daly’s front line are
senior Peter Smith, with 18 goals
in W&L’s last eight games of
1987, and freshman standout Mi-
chael Moseman.

The W&L midfield includes all-
conference senior Robbie Staun-
ton, faceoff-man Sandy Harrison
(66 percent in 1987) and sopho-
more Chris Mastrogiovanni. Jun-
ior middies Stuart Geisel and Joe
Caccamo and sophomores Chris
Giblin and Chris Kennedy should
also see action.

The Generals will begin the
season without senior co-captain
Chris Coffland, who is wearing a
cast for a fractured ankle.

The defense will feature four re-
turning starters in Campbell, jun-
ior Michael Jones and sophomores
Michael Nunan and Carlos Millan.
In addition, Daly said freshman de-
fender David Farace should see
playing time.

Senior Paul Burke takes over the
goalie position for W&L, and Daly
said his backups will be senior
Robert Buttarazzi and freshman
Thomas Costello.

W&L’s schedule for 1988 will
really put the pressure on Daly and
his players. In addition to confer-

America honors. On top of that, if
W&L is selected to play in the tour-
nament again, the Generals will have
the opportunity of playing for the
national title in front of their home-
town fans. The NCAA Champion-
ships will be held at W&L on May
15-22.

‘*For obvious reasons, we are ex-
cited about this season,’ said head
coach Gary Franke, the 1987 Division
III] Coach-of-the- Year. ‘‘We think we
can improve on last year and, if we
are lucky enough to receive another
NCAA tournament bid, we will play
on our home courts.’

Before they can be considered for
the bid, W&L must play a fierce
schedule that includes: 10 D-I foes;
four D-II opponents, including two
top-five teams (Rollins and Hampton
University; tow top-five NAIA
schools (Flagler and North Florida);
and three D- III teams ranked in the
top 13 in the nation. Two of the *‘big”’
D-III matches pit W&L against No. 6
Swarthmore and No. 2 Washington
College at Swarthmore on March 26
and 27.

Leading the way this year are two
senior all-Americans, David McLeod
and Chris Wiman, who have rep-

But Daly is nevertheless optimis
tic. “If we find the right chem
istry, we will be every bit as suc
cessful as last year,’’ he said

 

resented W&L at the NCAAs in all
three of their years on the team.
McLeod earned his all-America hon-
ors in singles in 1985 and in doubles
last year. Wiman became an all-
American in 1985 as a doubles.player.

The rest of the General’s lineup is
just as impressive. Junior Robert
Haley, W&L’s No. | singles player,
also won all- America recognition in
singles last year and is ranked No. 3 in
the preseason ITCA poll. Junior Bo-
bby Matthews. a 1987 all- American
in singles and doubles, will play No. 2
singles and is ranked No. 4 in the
nation.

McLeod and Wiman, who will
serve as co-captains, are the No. 3 and
No. 5 players, respectively.

Morris, an all-conference player
with a 21-5 record last season, will
play at No. 4. Freshman Bill Mea-
dows won the No. 6 singles position.

In doubles, McLeod and Matthews,
who reached the semifinals of last
year’s championships and had a 23-2
record, have been recognized by the
ITCA preseason poll as the No. 1
team in the nation. Morris and Wi-
man, who had a 23-4 record as the
No. 3 doubles team in 1987, move up
as the General’s No. 2 tandem.

PREVIEW:

als, White's time of 7.8 seconds was
more than enough to give him first
place.

White came back moments later and
won his second conference title with a
time of 52.6 seconds in the 400-meter
run,

But even before winning those two
events, White helped the Generals to
their first win of the day. In the
400-meter relay, he combined with
classmate John White, sophomore
Wes Boyd and freshman Erik Adkins
to set a new ODAC indoor record of
44.9 seconds.

Boyd also won an individual event,
taking first place in the 55-meter dash
with a time of 6.6 seconds.

In the distance events, W&L junior
Jamie Urso broke the two-minute
mark to take first place in the 800
(1:59.7). W&L senior James Buquet
placed second.

The Generals also took second,
third and fourth in the 1500 and sec-
ond, third, fourth and fifth in the
3000.

Checking the field events, the Gen-
erals scored 17 points and took four of
the top six places in the pole vault. As
expected, sophomore Phil Sampson
won the event and set a new ODAC
record, clearing 14-6. Sampson, who

pam

set the school record of 15 feet earlier
this month, missed on all three at-
tempts at 15-1.

W&L freshman David Johnston fin-
ished fourth in the pole vault, senior
Joseph Fisher was fifth, and senior
Robert Williamson took sixth place.

Freshman Carl Gilbert was a sur-
prise winner in the long jump, with a
personal best of 21-2.

“It was his first time in the long
jump this year, so I really hadn’t ex-
pected him to do that well,’” said Al-
dridge.

Another surprise was junior Jim
Ambrosini’s performance in the
shot put. Coming off a shoulder in-
jury, Ambrosini took second place in
his first competition this year.

Other scorers for W&L in the field
events were John White, who placed
fourth in the long jump and. triple
jump and sixth in the high jump, and
junior Fray McCormick, who took
third in the high jump.

The Generals will begin their out-
door season with a home meet on
March 18 against Bridgewater, Roan-
oke and Eastern Mennonite. ‘‘If we
can keep everybody healthy,’’ said
Aldridge, ‘‘we should have a good
outdoor season too.”’

Wahoos will be tough for Generals to handle

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

While most of the student body
is still recovering from FD, the
WAL lacrosse players will travel
to Charlottesville Saturday to begin
their 1988 regular season against
the University of Virginia.

While a victory against the Div-
ision-I Cavaliers will require an
outstanding effort from the D-III
Generals, head coach Dennis Daly
does not want his players to be too
concerned about one game.

‘We're not trying to change our
system to such a degree that it will
undermine our performance later
on,”’ said Daly.

As usual, the Wahoos have
plenty of talent on both ends of the
field.

The goalie position caused all
kinds of problems for Virginia in
1987, but that probably will not be

the case this year. Back in the goal
for the Cavs is senior Peter Shee-
han. A medical red shirt in 1987,
Sheehan won the C, Markland Ke-
lly Award in 1986 given annually
to the best goalie in Division I.

Currently a graduate student,
Sheehan recorded 150 saves and al-
lowed only 94 goals in 14 games in
1986.

Despite a relatively young de-
fense, Daly expects the U-Va. de-
fenders to play the aggressive,
takeaway style of lacrosse the
Cavs’ opponents have come to ex-
pect.

Virginia has always been known
for its strong midfield, and Daly
says this year’s squad continues
that tradition.

“They had a good recruiting
class, and there are some sopho-
mores and freshmen that should
perform quite well,”’ he said.

On attack, the Wahoos are prob-
ably stronger than they were last
year, according to Daly, with

crease attackman Chase Monroe
leading the way.

‘*He’s outstanding,’’ said Daly.
‘*They do an awful lot trying to get
him open.”’

Monroe recorded 39 points (33
goals, six assists) in 13 games for
the Cavaliers in 1987.

Looking ahewi to next week,
W&L’s first home game is also the
team’s Old Dominion Athletic
Conference opener. The Generals
will take on Randolph-Macon at 3
p.m. Tuesday on Wilson Field.
Washington and Lee beat the Yel-
low Jackets last year, 15- 11.

LAX FACTS—The Generals lost
to Virginia last season, 16-9, and
then rebounded with 10 wins in a
row.... Virginia head coach Jim
Adams has a 95-36 career record
as he begins his eleventh season in
Charlottesville.... Entering his
fifth season at W&L, Daly is
24-29.... Saturday’s game is the
season opener for both teams

FANCY DRESS— two of the most
popular words that a Washington and

 

misleading as to who could attend the

 

Lee student can utter. The thought
alone brings to mind some of the most
cherished memories I possess. This is,
without a doubt, the most festive acti

vity on the school calendar. In case
you have not experienced Fancy Dress
before, or if you are considering leay

ing for the weekend because you can

not find the right date, please allow
me two minutes of your time.

Make any necessary arrangements
to be in Lexington, Virginia between
the second and the sixth of March,
1988, for these days will provide you
with some of the best fun and fes
tivities that you will experience any
where, anytime. But before this time
arrives, you have one task— that of
finding one individual with whom to
share in the grand splendor of this
eagerly awaited event. If you are a
guy and need a date, check out The
Palms any night before March |, or
better yet, just be seen in public and
you are bound to find some woman
from one of the neighboring colleges

who would gladly give away her Dad-
dy’s BMW to have ‘‘THE BID** ex
tended her way. If you are a girl, blow
some guy's mind and ask him.
Whatever you do, just be there.

The festivities will begin around
Wednesday and run non-stop through
the weekend. People will congregate
at the Pit, at the new Student Activi-
ties Pavilion (for a top-name band, we
hope), at the Warner Center for the
ball itself, and at every location of
campus organization for parties of
every sort. The Fancy Dress experi-
I dare say, will not let you
down. As a senior staring graduation
in the face, I realize that there are in-
numerable things that I will sincerely
miss about my undergraduate years.
Fancy Dress is right around the top of
the list. It is the most eagerly awaited
weekend of the year, as people arrive
from all over the nation simply to ex-
perience this colossal occasion.

Quite frankly, I cannot think of a
better way to spend four or five days

ence,

The Ring-tum Phi, March 3, 1988

and nights. One of the best and most
unique qualities about W&L is the
personable nature of our community.

Fancy Dress is the perfect personifica-

tion of this characteristic. It brings
together everyone who has any tie
with the University for quality cele-
brating. For just a while, the cliques
and the barriers of our social lives are
Stripped away so that we can all enjoy
time together, an otherwise nonex-

istent condition. I hope everyone can
come away from Fancy Dress with the
same satisfaction that I have been able
to enjoy. Grab a date, call some
friends from home, and be sure to find
yourself in Lexington in early March;
for a better time cannot be found.

Fancy Dress— it is the ideal of perfec-
tion to any person seeking self-
Satisfaction as a second major.

Again the Ring-tum Phi apologizes
to Mr. Williams and regrets any in-
convenience the supplement article
may have caused.

 

 

Wes Craven misses again with Serpent

By Joel Miller
Staff Reporter

 

Since he directed Last House on the
Left (1972), Wes Craven has had
something of a difficult time in choos-
ing good movie material.

Last House on the Left was a movie
about some goons who rape two
women. It shows how the women’s
families take revenge on the rapists.
Grand Guignol seemed to be making a
comeback, but the movie didn’t make
a lot of money.

Sure, he made Swamp Thing (1982)
and based it on the then-popular comic
book. He even had Adrienne Barbeau
in it, but it wasn’t much of a box-
office hit. People just didn’t care
about monsters made out of rotten
vegetables.

But, of course, Wes caught on with
his movie A Nightmare on Elm Street.
Something about Freddy Krueger and
his ice-pick fingernails must have
psychologically entranced the movie-
going public—maybe having Dokken
on the soundtrack helped, too. A lot of

blood and a lot of screaming teenagers
equalled a lot of money for Craven.

The Serpent and the Rainbow, |
hoped, would change Craven into a
full-fledged Hollywood director. But
when I found out it was ‘‘based on a
true story’’ I began to wonder: ‘*Cra-
ven can’t make a documentary, he can
only make a flick with lots of blood.”’

As it turned out, The Serpent and
the Rainbow wasn’t much of a docu-
mentary—it was your typical Craven
movie.

A Boston medical corporation sends
an American anthropologist (Bill
Pullman) to Port-Au-Prince, Haiti, to
check out reports about zombies run-
ning around in broad daylight. The
corporation CEOs think that they can
use the ‘‘zombie-making’’ recipe to
save lives and make a lot of money in
the process.

So Pullman rides the plane down to
Haiti and meets a doctor who swears
she can show him some real-life zom-
bies. Pullman doesn’t believe her but
they go and look for a zombie any-
way. They meet some guys who can
practice white (i.e., ‘‘good’’) magic,

and Pullman gets to see some Haitians
who are possessed. Just when he
thinks he’s catching on, Pullman finds
out that an evil government official is
watching him, so he decides to do a
little ‘“‘undercover work."’

While he’s doing all this detective’

work, Pullman begins to have some
terrifying dreams. For instance, a de-
composing bride keeps following him
around Haiti and trying to kill him
with the snake that’s in her mouth.
Pullman thinks he’s going crazy, but
his doctor friend says, ‘‘It’s only a
dream.”’

Pullman finally gets to meet a zom-
bie in a cemetery, but he doesn’t learn
how it all works, so he goes to a Hai-
tian who can make zombies with all
sorts of herbs and chemicals. The Hai-
tian wants to charge him $1,000 but
settles for $500. In the meantime, the
evil governmental official beats up
Pullman all night and then dumps him
out in the street. ‘‘You should go
home,”’ he says.

Always a glutton for punishment,
Pullman still seeks to get the recipe to
make zombies and finally buys it. But

the police pick him up and send him
back to America. While he’s in Bos-
ton, he starts dreaming that his girl-
friend is in a lot of trouble, so he goes
back to Haiti to save her from the evil
police officer, who’s really a voodoo
king.

When he gets back to Haiti, the
voodoo king turns him into a zombie
and buries him. Pullman looks like
he’s in a lot of trouble. A zombie digs
him up and Pullman goes to save his
girlfriend. She’s about to get her head
cut off when he shows up and he has
to rough up the voodoo king to save
her. He sets the guy on fire and it
looks like the voodoo king is dead, but
you can’t be too sure about these voo-
doo matters, But there is a happy end-
ing.

There’s an awful lot of plot in The
Serpent and the Rainbow, but the spe-
cial effects make it bearable. A lot of
blood and a lot of nasty-looking crea-
tures, so that means a lot of money for
Craven.

deMovellan, Finkelstein win;
Parker, Yu in runoff today

 

By Wendy Wolford
Staff Reporter

 

For Christopher de Movellan and
Hugh Finkelstein, the Big Three Elec-
tions on Monday were a success. For
Alston Parker and Edward Yu,
however, the elections are not quite
over. They continued to vie for the
position of EC secretary in a run-off
election today.

De Movellan captured 55 percent of
the vote over Matt Bryant for presi-
dent, while Finkelstein defeated Chris
Giblin with 64 percent of the vote for
the position of vice-president. For
Parker and Yu, the results were
somewhat closer. Parker and Yu
received 40 percent and 41 percent of
the vote respectively, knocking oppo-

nent David Grove out of the race.

De Movellan hopes to improve stu-
dent involvement with the Student Ac
tivities Board. Due to the change in
the drinking age, attendance in con-
certs and other SAB activities has
been low. He also would like to em-
phasize the role of the EC as a fact-
finding body rather than as a prosecut-
ing body in matters concerning the
honor code.

Finkelstein faces the future with two
major goals. From a law school pers-
pective, he hopes to close the gap be-
tween the law school and the under-
graduate school. Looking at the stu-
dent body as a whole, Finkelstein
would like to work on the Mock Con-
vention budget because ‘‘it takes a
chunk out of the budget every four
years, devastating different student

organizations.”’

Voter turn-out in the elections on
Monday was relatively high. Out of
1,878 students, 1,252 students voted,
which amounts to 67 percent of the
student body. Also, more students
participated in the vice-presidential
elections than in the presidential and
secretarial elections.

The question of who next year’s EC
Secretary will be lies in today’s elec-
tion. Although the winners of the elec-
tion on Monday needed a majority of
the vote to win, whoever has a plura-
lity of the vote between Parker and Yu
will be declared elected.

Because the results were so close
between the two candidates, the elec-
tion will rest on the support of the
voters who previously voted for
Grove.

 

Students vote in Monday’s election.

Mock Convention still needs 400-500 delegates to fill their slate

‘

 

By Christie Champlin

" Staff Reporter

 

Although W&L’s Mock Convention
is only two weeks away, 400-500 stu-
dent delegates are still needed. There
are only 1200 delegates registered out
of the 1600-1700 that are required,
according to Brad Shaw, the public re-
lations chairman of the convention.

Programs are in the works to recruit
students from the local high schools

fill the deficit of delegates. Shaw said

Soviets

to study
at W&L

 

Co-Editor

 

Three Soviet students will attend
W&L during the 1988-89 academic
year as part of an academic exchange
program between the U.S. and the
Soviet Union, according to John W.
Elrod, vice president for academic af-

In exchange, up to three W&L stu-
dents may travel to the U.S.S.R. to
study at one of 15 universities for the
1989-90 academic year, said Elrod.

‘This is a historic opportunity. It is
the very first time that undergraduates
in the United States and the Soviet
Union have studied in these countries
this way,”’ said John.

‘It will give undergraduates the op-
portunity to learn the languages, the
culture, and the histories of each oth-
er’s countries,’’ said John, ‘‘The hope
is that this will grow and have a posi-
tive impact on the relationship be-
tween the United States and the Soviet
Union.”

While at W&L, the soviet students
will be free to study whatever subjects
they want, said Vladimir V. Yarygin,

he hoped local high schools can pro-

vide a couple hundred delegates, if

needed.

Shaw is working with reference li-
brarian Peggy Hays to contact the jun-
ior and senior classes of the local high
schools. This year some of the senior
classes will be on trips, so a larger
amount of support is needed from jun-
ior classes. Students from Parry
McCluer Middle School will be used
as messengers for the convention.
Approximately 50 to 60 students from
area high schools were involved in the

last Mock Convention.

Convention members have been go-
ing down the road to area women’s
colleges to solicit their participation in
the convention. The registration form
has been published in all of their re-
spective newspapers, and sign-ups
have been held during lunches. Shaw
thinks the off-campus recruitment
programs are more organized this
year due to the work of Hays.

Even with the heavy recruitment
from other sources, ‘‘the main pref-
erence is for W&L students,”” said
Shaw, adding ‘‘if we could fill the

March 4.

Soviet students will consult with
their advisors on what subjects to take
in order to continue progress in their
education, said Yarygin.

“*T think the main point is the quality
of the education,”’ said Yarygin.

Yarygin said that the students will

live with American students and will
also be allowed to travel freely
throughout the U.S.

The program, which was proposed
by the U.S., is expected to have
‘highly positive results,’* said Yary-

Paxton’s lecture on ‘Frogs and Yanks’
highlights 1988 Phi Beta Kappa induction

 

By Jennifer Bandrowski
Staff Reporter

 

On Monday the Gamma of Virginia
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa held its an-
nual convocation ceremony in Lee
Chapel.

The ceremony was conducted by
Phi Beta Kappa President Robert W.
McAhren and Treasurer J.B. Goehr-
ing.

Following the announcement of the
new members, guest speaker Robert
O. Paxton, class of 1954, delivered an
address entitled *‘Frogs and Yanks:
French and American Stereotypes of
Each Other.”’

After graduating from W&L, Pax-
ton studied at Oxford University as a
Rhodes Scholar, and earned his Ph.D.
from Harvard University in 1963. He
is currently Professor of History at

‘ Columbia University, where he has
_ been a member of the faculty since

1969. He is the author of three books:
’ Parades and Politics at Vichy, Old

_ Guard and New Order, and Vichy

France and the Jews.
‘‘Group stereotypes are I suppose

, older than language,” he said, refer-

ring to Virgil’s /iad and Greece and
’ Troy’s stereotypes of one another.
He spoke of the history of French

and American stereotypes from the
time of Thomas Jefferson, when
Americans were idealized by some
Frenchmen as ‘‘noble frontiersmen.”’
Thomas Jefferson advised a friend
against sending his child to Europe,
because he would learn of ‘‘volup-
tuary dress and infidelity to the mar-
riage bed.”’

Paxton spoke of Chateaubriand’s
journey to the U.S. in 1791 under the
pretext of looking for a Northwest
Passage, ‘‘when he was really looking
for material for a novel.”’

_ Chateaubriand idealized the noble
savage but found that ‘turban Ameri-
cans talked only of money,’’ Paxton
said.

Paxton remarked on French opinion
of the 1830s ‘‘camp meetings”’ in the
U.S., which ensured French opinion
that ‘‘the god of the American Puritan
equaled the dollar.””

By the 1870s, each country had so
stereotyped the other’s cuisine that
“‘both countries were appalled by
what the other ate,’ Paxton said. But
some of these **...old stereotypes have
made complete reversals,’’ he added.

After the First World War,
‘*...many stereotypes were shaped
when the young soldiers first saw
Paris,’ Paxton said. He described the
Folie Bergere as actually a group of

‘British chorus girls dancing before
an audience of German, American,
and Japanese businessmen. ”’

Paxton remarked that while attend-
ing a dinner party in France he had
been asked, ‘‘Is there anything other
than the dollar that holds the United
States together?”’

He concluded his speech by refer-
ring to “‘the cleverest satire of
national stereotypes,’’ Montesquieu’s
Lettres Persanes, in which the author
concluded, ‘‘Men should stay where
they are.”’

In addition to announcing the new
members of Phi Beta Kappa, two
awards were presented. The Phi Beta
Kappa Sophomore Award was presen-
ted to Damon Vincent Fensterman,
the sophomore with the highest grade
point average for his first four semes-
ters of work completed at W&L. The
Edward Pinney Prize was awarded to
senior Mark L. Farley

Eighteen seniors, fourteen juniors,
and two members of the class of 1987
were elected into the fraternity. Each
member of the junior class has a grade
point average of 3.9 or above

The newly elected members are:
Michael Patrick Aarstol, Dana Su
zanna Anstine, Todd Stuart Barton,

convention with all W&L students, we
would.”’

He views the convention as some-
thing in which everyone can become
involved. In order to reserve a posi-
tion on a state delegation students
should fill out the registration form
printed in this issue. Efforts will be
made to place students on the dele-
gation of the state of their preference
when possible. Some of the larger
states are still in need of delegates due
to the size of their delegations.

Completion of the form is an as-

major courses, language proficiency,
and a high level of interest in the pro-
gram, Yarygin.

According to Elrod, the selection
process for W&L students ‘‘has yet to
be worked out.’’ However, Elrod said
that two main requirements have been
established: students must travel to the

(_]See Soviet, page 4

sured spot as a delegate. The form can
be turned in any time until the conven-
tion, preferably by Friday, March 18.
Delegate packets can be obtained from
the registration booth at the conven-
tion after payment of the $10 fee.

Shaw encourages student participa-
tion because this convention is ‘‘the
only place where students can partici-
pate in one, as opposed to watching on
television.’ The convention enables
students to get ‘‘first-hand experience
on the exact procedures and all that
goes into selecting a party’s candi-
date,’’ according to Shaw.

The Mock Convention has correctly
predicted the presidential nominee 13
times in 18 attempts since its begin
ning in 1908 after a speech by William
Jennings Bryan, and has only been in
correct once since 1948.

Student delegates can be involved in
many aspects of the convention. The
convention provides a chance to
“work with peers and people you
probably know pretty well, which is
fun,’* said Shaw, adding that it is also
an opportunity ‘‘to re-enact the role of
a delegate in a convention mirrored in
the accuracy of the convention itself. ”’

Professor speaks on

 

By Jon Ryan
Staff Reporter

 

Samir Saliba, chairman of the pol-
itical science department at Emory
and Henry University, delivered a lec-
ture here on Monday entitled *‘Radi-
cal Islam and the Secular City.’’

Saliba, a native of Lebanon, spoke
on the topic of religion and the need to
appreciate it in dealing with the Third
World, especially the Middle East and
the world of Islam.

According Saliba the world is in a
post-modern era, searching for a new
theology and a new political system .

Saliba said history can be viewed as
a bi-polar struggle between two op-
posing forces he called the ‘‘God
view’’ and the ‘‘world-view.””

The ‘‘God view’’ asserts he supre-
macy of God over man and the supre-
macy of God’s law.

The ‘‘world view’’ asserts the supe-
riority of man and the nation-state
over the world.

According to Saliba, when the
nation-state declines in power, reli-
gion has always gained power at the
expense of the nation-state.

Saliba said modern internationalism
has eroded the nation state’s 400-year
old domination of power. Religion, he
said, has moved in to take the lost

modern religious revival

power. An event Saliba said political
scientists call ‘‘filling a power vac-
uum.

Saliba cited the Iranian revolution,
the rise of the: Moral Majority, lib
eration theology, and religious revival
in Latin America as evidence that the
rise of religion is a worldwide pheno
menon, not an occurrence limited to
the Islamic world.

The religious revival is especially
important in the Islamic world, he
said, because the idea of a nation-state
is a Western idea, not an Islamic one.

The Islamic world used a system of
caliphates, in which the local ruler
was the ‘‘defender of the faith.’’ The
system tied together the ‘‘God-view”’
and the ‘‘world-view’’ whereas the
Western world separated the two.

Both the major Islamic groups, the
Sunni majority group and the Shiite
minority, favor the de-Westernization
of Islam and a return to the fundamen-
tals, although not necessarily a strict,
dogmatic approach.

The tenets of the world-view are es-
pecially repugnant to Moslems, he
said, because Moslems believe in the
supremacy of God over man and the
need for God’s law as an anchor for
behavior.

Moslems, he said, eschew the mu-
table law of man for the unchanging
law of God.

OPINION

Outside view

The following column, by Roanoke Times & World News Editor-
ial Page Editor Gene Owens, appeared in last Sunday's Times and
World News. It is reprinted by permission.

 

Brothers and sisters of the Southland, white folks and blacks,
come let us reason together. The theme of national reconcilation for
the Fancy Dress ball at Washington and Lee University is not born
of racism. It is born of a historical perspective that flows from only
one side of the dual culture that inhabits our region. Blame the lim-
ited perspective. We must stop slapping racist labels on motives that
may not be racist at all.

At Washington and Lee, black students vowed to boycott the an-
nual Fancy Dress ball because of its theme: the reconciliation of
North and South after the Civil War. The black students contend
that this reconciliation took place at the expense of black people.

They vowed to pursue the boycott even through the Student Acti-
vities Board, which planned the ball, agreed that:

®No Confederate flags would be displayed.

©No Southern plantation would be depicted in the decorations.

*Students would be discouraged from wearing blue or gray uni-
forms to the ball.

A white person, without any conscious racial bias, might ask in
bewilderment: How can blacks possibly be offended by a recon-
ciliation theme? How can one enroll in an institution called Wash-
ington and Lee and not expect many student events to follow themes
relating to the Civil War and is aftermath? And how can you separ-
ate the heritage from its symbols: the Confederate flag, the South
ern plantation house, the military uniforms of the era.

W&L faces an unusual dilemma in making black students wel-
come and comfortable on campus. It is named after two secular
saints of the white South, one of whom now sleeps in the hollowed
campus soil. Washington was a lifelong slave-owner. Lee led the
army that fought for the independence of slave-owning states.

But Washington also played a major role in establishing this con-
tinent as a bastion for democracy. And Lee must be reckoned as a
man of honor who lived with an incredibly difficult decision of
conscience, struck by it nobly, and endured defeat with dignity and
without rancor. One can admire the man without endorsing the
cause for which he fought, and without being racist.

But the tradition of Robert E. Lee is not the only tradition woven
into the intricately beautiful but tragically flawed fabric of white
Southern society. For every Lee there is a Bull Conner; for every
Washington a Gene Talmadge; for every Jefferson a George Wal-
lace.

The Confederate flag, lowered nobly at Appomattox, was raised
ingloriously at Oxford, Miss., and at dozens of other Southern sites
where bigotry rose to defy racial justice. If white Southerners see it
as the banner of a noble army, under which their forefathers fought
and died, black Southerners see it as the emblem of white supre-
macy, under which their forefathers were shipped and lynched.

I have lived long enough to know that attitudes have changed.
While racism is not dead, it no longer is the ruling passion of the
white South. Most white Southerners, I believe, have no particular
ill will toward blacks.

But there are cultural barriers between many whites and their
black neighbors. Many blacks, legally free to enter the white
middle-class culture, are uncomfortable in its strange surroundings.
Many whites feel the same discomfort when they find themselves in
a black cultural environment. It isn’t mutual hostility, but an unea-
siness with the unfamiliar.

Those barriers can be eroded over time, but it will take conscious
effort—and consciousness-raising—on both sides.

The W&L Student Activities Board needed a black member to
provide the other Southern perspective. It has no black member.

The board’s officers are chosen by the popularly elected Student
Executive Committee. The officers in turn select the other student
members. I’m willing to believe that the W&L students did what
their predecessors did long before blacks came to campus: They
picked the board members on the basis of popularity, friendships,
and name recognition. With only 30 blacks in a student body of
1,800—and with the cultural separation that occurs even on small
campuses—the system was almost sure to produce on all-white
board. The small black voice was not shouted down; it just wasn’t
heard until it cried in pain.

White Southerners should keep a sensitive ear tuned to that black
voice. But black Southerners should be prepared to show us whites
a degree of tolerance, too. The Confederacy stood for other things
besides slavery, and not all of them were intrinsically evil. Not
every Southern mansion harbored the personification of evil. One
such mansion harbored Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration
of Independence. Another harbored James Madison, father of our -
constitutional system of checks and balances. Out of another came
George Mason, father of the Bill of Rights, who was an early oppo-
nent of slavery.

The Confederate battle flag has been co-opted by evil. But it
might help to remember that the army that fought under it was led
by a men who, long before the Civil War, had freed the slaves he
inherited.

While black Southerners struggle to discover and preserve the
noble features of their heritage, they should recognize the white
Southerner’s desire to preserve the positive features of his own.
This is not racism, but a natural reverence for the cultural soil from
which we sprang and for the people who bequeathed us their genes.
Let us understand and be tolerant.

Thompson inaugurates Phi dating service

To Mr. Crabill:

For the last two weeks I have spoken only as the
MSA president, and I have not in any way reflec-
ted my personal thoughts. Mr. Crabill, I am sorry
I do not recall ever talking with you on a personal
level; therefore, I cannot possibly imagine how
you logically concluded that I was prejudiced.

I am not quite sure toward which race you ac-
cuse me of being prejudiced, but in trying to re-
duce the cloth for my hoop skirt and in trying to
become better acquainted with my date for the Old
South Ball, I would like to tell you a few things
about myself.

1, Freshman year I lived in a single.room, so
maybe I show I am prejudiced toward people of
all races who are willing to share a room.

2. Sophomore year I shared a house with three
white girls. Here again, I must admit that I may
how shown a prejudice against people of any race
who own a home and are not willing to have a
party every weekend. (Get off None-ery!)

3. This year I live with a Japanese girl and a
white girl. I do not think that they consider me to
be prejudiced, except toward those people of all
races who leave hair in the bottom of the bath tub.

4. So, finally, maybe I am prejudiced toward
blacks. Imagine the irony of those people electing
me as their president.

I would also like for you to know that I have no
preconceived negative notion about your frater-
nity, as I know several brothers there, and I do re-
spect them. I would not generally want to go to a
party such as this, but your offer is far too gener-
ous. Also, I have a new-found respect for you, be-
ing that the last time a brother of your fraternity
took a black girl on a date there was a ‘‘disturban-
ce’’, and that brother and several other members
deactivated.

I trust you are a gentleman and will assure me a
violence-free night. And I will do the same when
you escort me to the NAACP Spring Ball.

Thanks again,

Rosalyn D. Thompson

P.S. Thank you for starting the first Ring-tum Phi

Dating Service and choosing me as your first date.

By the way, my friend Robin wants to come to the
Ball too; could you find a date for her?

Webb wants reconciliation

To the Editor:

It is my sincere hope that the recent controversy
surrounding Fancy Dress has made us more aware
of one another, and imparted an understanding
which will help us to grow together in the future.
Beyond the impassioned rhetoric on both sides,

‘there is a greater lesson to be learned from all of

this. What price must we be willing to pay for
people of different backgrounds and cultures to
live together with a minimum of discord? What
price for heterogeneity to flourish? What price
unity?

There is no question that no malicious design or
racial hostility was intended by the members of
the SAB when they chose ‘‘Reconciliation’’ as
this year’s theme, for the theme captures the es-
sence of our common heritage as Americans and
our traditions at Washington and Lee. For the
preservation of the unity of the greatest nation on
earth Reconciliation was a magnanimous endea-
vor with noble intent. In the spirit of Recon-
ciliation, our ancestors rebuilt the union of 38
states, and diffused the hostility which had cul-
minated in the War Between the States, a war
which had pitted America against herself—brother
against brother, friend against friend. While at
first with considerable sacrifice of the pride and
dignity of the South, our forefathers dared to
renew the bonds of our common heritage, and
moved forward to make possible the benefits of
progress we now enjoy in 1988. In this same spirit
of Reconciliation, General Lee came to this uni-
versity to create an institution of learning where
all Americans could pursue the advantages of
higher education.

Nor is there any question that many black
Americans still feel the heartache of a bitter es-
trangement our ancestors of color suffered during
this period of Reconciliation—an alienation which
has abated in intensity, but one which continues to
thrive in many corners of our society today. While
the Union was restored in 1865, such a union was
completed with the neglectful sacrifice of our
black ancestors. Towards union, the promises of
prosperity, forty acres, and a mule were stripped
away from America’s black citizens. Towards
union, Plessy v. Ferguson was upheld, and nu-
merous Jim Crow laws were enacted to restrict the

-mobility. of our fellow black Americans ,and:deny

their inalienable rights as human beings and. citi-
zens of this grand republic. Towards union, we
overlooked the countless Blacks who were subjec-
ted to the hostility and racial violence of lynch
mobs and the emerging Ku Klux Klan. Having
endured the misery of slavery for 250 years,
Blacks accepted their newly granted freedom in an
environment indifferent to their concerns, and one
which refused to accord to them the fullest bless-
ings of this precious gift of American citizenship.
It is no wonder that many black Americans would
look upon this period of Reconciliation with deep
suspicion and consternation? Time has not yet
healed all of the wounds of this disaffection, but
much can be done by people of both races to ex-
pedite the healing process.

We have come a long way together. Yet, de-
spite the sacrifices of many, black and white, to
make good the promises of our forefathers to all
Americans, there are still many who cannot move
into the neighborhoods of their choice, many who
are denied full acceptance as we relate socially
one to another, and many children who cannot
dream to rise to the highest echelons of elective
office or corporate enterprise because of the color
of their skin. The battle has moved beyond the
courtroom chambers and the halls of the legisla-
ture to the individual hearts and minds of every
American. A part of this process is a willingness
to look beyond ourselves, to be cognizant of the
feelings of all others, black or white, man or
woman, and the rest.

In a culturally diverse community we must be
mindful of the differences which exist among us,
but always striving toward unity in purpose. We
will not always agree with one another, and we
must be willing to compromise with an eye
towards the progress of our community, but we
will never act with malice or benign neglect
towards one another. Mutual courtesy, respect,
and understanding are the price we must be will-
ing to pay for a heterogenous environment to
flourish and prosper. This is the challenge of our
little experiment in democracy: that we choose
freely to judge one another as individuals, not be-
cause the law or world opinion says we should do
it, but because we understand that we share a
common bond.

Let us stand together, and take this opportunity
in 1988 to effect a true Reconciliation. Let us
work together to bring about a more perfect union
here at Washington and Lee. Let us pray together
for a day when the sins of the past can be forgi-
ven, and reason shall triumph over passion and
ignorance, so we can celebrate together those
things we share in common. Perhaps I am a
dreamer and the greatest fool on earth, but I be-
lieve we will make it happen one day. I truly be-
lieve.

Sincerely,
Michael D. Webb

Student defends O’Brien

To the Editors:

It is truly unfortunate that the theme of Fancy
Dress was controversial for the second consecu-
tive year. However, the dissatisfaction of a few
individuals does not give them the right to person-
ally attack Mr. Tom O’Brien or the university.

Mr. O’Brien (and the rest of the SAB) deserves

nothing but praise for the time and energy he de-
voted to this year’s ball. He does not deserve to be
personally attacked as having a ‘‘deranged child-
hood’’ as Mr. Cobb did in his clever, but cowar-
dly, column last week. I know of no evidence that
Mr. O’Brien was insane, unbalanced, demented,
or any of the other symptoms for ‘‘deranged’’ in
his childhood. Perhaps Mr. Cobb should support
this allegation or issue an apology to Mr. O’Brien
for this vicious attack on his character. If Mr.
Cobb has a personal grudge against Mr. O’Brien
he should at least have the courage to claim the
words or identify the speaker, that he quoted. Ad-

«, (ditionally, Mr. .Cobb should retract his erroneous

assertion that Mr. O’Brien spent Fancy Dress
funds without proper authorization (FD is self-
financing and, as such, requires no authorization).

In addition to implying that Mr. O’Brien is a ra-
cist, Miss Thompson of the MSA also accused
Washington and Lee of being ‘‘the most racist”’
school in the nation. This accusation is utterly ri-
diculous and hardly deserves a_ response.
Nevertheless, the facts are that W&L has a full-
time Dean for Minority Affairs, has established a
residence and social facility for MSA members,
has actively sought to attract black faculty mem-
bers through an innovative program, and has elec-
ted a black student as Secretary of the Executive
Committee. In making this scathing allegation and
attracting media attention, Miss Thompson has
damaged the reputation of W&L and hampered
the administration’s efforts to attract more minor-
ity students and faculty members. Unfortunately,
it appears that Miss Thompson put her desire to at-
tract attention ahead of any consideration of the
welfare of minority students at W&L.

In closing, Fancy Dress is a social activity, and
those who choose to make it a political event are
completely missing the point of having student
social functions. There are several organizations
on campus in which a person can make a political
statement, but the SAB is not an appropriate
forum for making such statements. Isn’t it nice to
leave politics out of Fancy Dress and have a good
time at a social event with other students? I sin-
cerely hope that Fancy Dress will continue to be
student run and that those who seek to misuse it
for political purposes will not be allowed to erode
student autonomy or needlessly censor the majori-
ty.

Eugene L. Stephenson, ’88

Writer asks understanding

To the Editor:

I read with disbelief the comments written by
students such as Alford and Schmidt in last week’s
Phi. The comments were saturated with sarcasm,
insensitivity, and tones of bitterness. I am dis-
mayed that such seemingly intelligent students
such as themselves cannot understand why we
(MSA) boycotted and why we feel so strongly
about the ‘‘Reconciliation’’ theme. It is not ‘‘Re-
conciliation,’ the word that we oppose. We all,
however, must face the truth and be honest with
ourselves about the issue at hand. During the time
when the North and South were supposedly rec-
onciling their differences, blacks were being lyn-
ched on a daily basis and there was more racial
violence than I care to think about. There was an
overwhelming amount of hatred and resentment
toward blacks and this is why we are opposed to
the theme.

As far as I'm concerned the choosing of this
theme as even a possibility showed a lack of con-
cern about its possible ramifications and effects on
minorities, not to mention an utter lack of creative
ability on the part of the SAB members who chose
it. I must also mention with disgust that anyone
desiring to fashion confederate uniforms shows a
considerable amount of not only indiscretion but
an uncaring attitude toward what the uniform
symbolizes—southern aggression instead of

peace; division instead of unity, and above all,
slavery instead of freedom.

We did not expect support from the university
when we decided to boycott. We did expect
though, that our decision to do so would be re-
spected, if not more, by the student body. We did
what we believed was right and it’s a pity that
some call us ‘‘radical’’ or ‘‘disgusting’’ because
of it.
what we did and will resent us for our decision but
until you have lived inside a skin-color that has
been such a liability for some of us and have en-
dured hatred from others who think they deserve
better because of their hair texture, or social class,
then I suggest you take a long look at yourself and
your values and leave others’ alone.

Roschele Mack, ’91

Evangelist explains views

To the Editor:

I would like to take this opportunity to respond
to Mr. Sbar’s ‘‘My View’’ column of last week’s
Phi. There are several common misconceptions
concerning evangelists and the Gospel they pro-
claim which I believe merit an explanation.

First, Mr. Sbar and many others seem to feel
that evangelists and evangelical Christians believe
they are ‘‘always right.’ Any Christian who is
honest will point out to you that we are not always
right—as everyone, we fail at times. But we stand
on the Living God, who is without failure. Mr.
Sbar also contends that ‘Evangelists talk to God
whenever they feel like it.’ Anyone who is right
with God can do that. Try it and see.

Mr. Sbar is correct in pointing out that the main
idea of Josh McDowell’s presentation was that
God’s laws against sex outside of marriage is for
our protection. One only needs to pick up a news-

 

LETTERS

paper or hear a news broadcast to see the grim
effects of AIDS, herpes, and other sexually
transmitted diseases on this world. 1.5 million ba-
bies are murdered in the womb each year in this
country, often the children of unmarried young
people. The incredible divorce rate and its effects
on American society and the grief wrought by
promiscuous sex are just a few of the ills imposed
on society by sexual practice outside the paramet-
ers established by God.

The entire tone of the article by Mr. Sbar sug-
gested that Josh was promoting moral reformation
as a way to avoid hell. Josh actually presented the
Biblical perspective that only through a personal
relationship with Christ does one inherit eternal
life—not by observing a set of laws, as Mr. Sbar
implies and millions believe. Christians commit
sin—even sexual sin—but I would urge you to
read Romans 10:9-13 and see how the sin of a
Christian is paid for.

Finally, I do not understand the hostility of Mr.
Sbar and many others toward evangelical Chris-
tians. I would encourage each of you to find an
evangelical or a fundamentalist and let us person-
ally explain the many prevalent misconceptions
concerning our beliefs. We are not puritanical
censors, out to judge or damn sinners. We are
simply striving, upon our Lord’s command of
Matthew 28: 19-20, to tell sinners that God wants
to help them just as they are. We work to present
the Gospel, not force it upon anyone. Contrary to
popular opinion, the Christian does this out of
love, not of hate. Josh himself said in his talk that
he would not try to shove Christ down anyone’s
throat: the final decision to follow God or not to
would be up to each individual. Josh did not claim
to be perfect, and neither did Mr. Sbar. I certainly
do not believe I am perfect, and I did not write this
response to be argumentative or contentious but
only to present the truth—not my truth, but God’s.
Do not take my word or Josh’s, but instead try
God’s way for yourself. I believe you will not re-
gret your decision to do so.

AIDS symposium
set for next week

Student’s disk dumped

To the Editor:

Recently, I had the unfortunate experience of
losing my computer disk, upon which were stored
all of my papers for the 87-88 academic year. I
must confess I did not have the foresight to store
everything on a back-up disk; I should have been
more careful with such important papers. Yet my
frustration at this experience was surpassed by my
dismay for what was to come. Naturally, I began a
mad search for the missing disk: I looked in the
computer rooms, throughout the library stacks,
and in my classrooms, and waded through the
piles of lost and found items at the library’s circu-
lation desk.

Finally when all my efforts had failed, I consul-
ted a member of the computer center staff. She in-
formed me that disks left in the computer rooms
are collected, and if they are not claimed within a
week, are recycled. One student aid confessed to
me that disks left in the library computer rooms
are simplv thrown away.

If a pair of diamond earrings had been lost at the
Fancy Dress Ball, would it be thrown away if its
owner had not claimed it in a week? Or would the
dining hall staff cart all of its lost and found items
off to Goodwill after only seven days? Students
computer disks hold filing cabinets full of irre-
placeable information and it seems to me that such
valuable items should be kept for a minimum of
one term if not for the remainder of the school
year.

I call these indiscretions to the attention of the
W&L community so that everyone takes the
necessary precautions to ensure the safety of valu-
able papers. In the future I hope the computer
center will show more sensitivity...or at least
more sense.

TALKBACK

Three of the nation’s foremost
AIDS spokesmen will discuss the
disease and its spread during a two
day symposium at W&L, March 18
and 19.

**The AIDS Crisis: Three Perspec-
tives,’ a symposium sponsored by
W&L’s Telford Lecture Series, is free
and open to the public.

The symposium will begin with an
address by Dr. Richard D. Keeling,
director of student health at the Uni-
versity of Virginia. Keeling will speak
on ‘‘AIDS and Other Sexually Trans-
mitted Diseases’ at 7:30 p.m., Fri-
day, March 18 in Lee Chapel.

The sessions will resume at 10
a.m., Saturday, March 19 in Lee
Chapel with an address by Dr. Mer-
vyn F. Silverman, a 1960 graduate of
W&L, and president of the American
Foundation for AIDS Research and
director of the Robert Wood John
Foundation AIDS Health Services
Program in San Francisco. Silverman
will speak about ‘*Public Health Po-
licy on AIDS.”

At 11:30 a.m., Dr. Robert T.
Schooley, a 1970 graduate of W&L
and AIDS researcher for the Massa-
chusetts General Hospital and the
Harvard Medical School, will bring
the sessions to a close. Schooley’s to-
pic will be ‘‘Research Progress on
AIDS.”

All three speakers have been in-
volved in AIDS research, education,
and policy issues since the earliest
days of the disease’s identification and
have made presentations throughout
the country.

A graduate of the University of Vir-
ginia, Keeling received his M.D. de-
gree from the Tufts University Schoo!
of Medicine. He is president-elect of
the American College Health Associa-
tion and has served as an AIDS con-
sultant to more than 40 public and pri-
vate college and universities across
the country.

Keeling is the author of many arti-
cles on AIDS. He serves as chair of
the Task Force on AIDS for the Amer-
ican College Health Association, and
is a member of the ad hoc advisory
committee on AIDS for the United
States Public Health Service and the

Debaters take England

From Staff Reports

 

Two members of the W&L debate
team, Donald DeFabio of Bethesda,
Md., and Damon Fensterman of
Lynchburg, Va., recently returned
from a victorious forensic tour of
Great Britain. The two sophomores
continued a three-year winning streak
for the W&L team in Great Britain.

At University College in London,
before the oldest debating society in
Great Britain, the two W&L debaters
opposed the motion, ‘‘This House be-
lieves that American society is debau-
ched.’’ Defending the U.S., DeFabio
contended, ‘‘one could not judge
Americans on the basis of individual
leaders, but that consideration should
be given to the spirit of American cul-
ture.”

Countering charges that American:
were insensitive to the plight of he
poor and homeless, DeFabio ex
plained that the U.S. government wa
aware of the problems, but had yet t
determine the most efficient ways t
alleviate them. In his ‘‘summing-up’
speech, Fensterman told the audienc:
that, ‘‘the spirit of American argu
ment had not been refuted,’’ and ur
ged them to reject the motion.

The W&L team won by a 30-15 div
ision of the house vote.

Travelling on to the University o
Southampton, the W&L debater
faced the motion, *‘This House pret
ers government for the people rathe
than by the people.’’ Although th
W&L debaters were denied any rebut
tal speeches, they lost the debate by

-WA&L receives theater grant

a,

ee ee ee ee

 

From Staff Reports

 

W&L has been awarded a $600,000
challenge grant from The Kresge
Foundation of Troy, Mich., toward
construction of the university's Center
for the Performing Arts.

W&L has now received gifts or gift
commitments of $6 million for the $9
million project, which will house all
of the university’s performing arts
programs.

‘“The Kresge Foundation’s chal-
lenge grant constitutes a major stimu-
lus as we move into the final stages of
our fund raising for this important
project,’’ said President John D. Wil-
son. ‘‘We deeply appreciate that The
Kresge Foundation has offered this
help and especially that it has come in
the form of a challenge we can use to

open new doors of commitment."’

The Center for the Performing Arts
will be located diagonally across Nel
son Street from the new Gaines Resi-
dence Hali and will be adjacent to the
old Lexington train station.

The facility will include a 425-seat,
State-of-the-art main theatre that will
be adaptable for dramatic and musical
performances, an experimental
theatre, dressing rooms, office space,
and a main lobby that will also serve
as a gallery for a portion of the univer-
sity’s art collection.

The Kresge challenge grant, an-
nounced in February, was one of 34
grants that the organization made in
1988. The foundation will continue to
make grants throughout the year.
Grants are made toward projects in-
volving construction or renovation of
facilities and the purchase of major
capital equipment or real estate. Most

grant recipients have raised initial
funds toward their respective projects
before requesting assistance from the
Kresge Foundation. Grants are then
made on a challenge basis, requiring
the raising of the remaining funds,
thereby ensuring completion of the
projects.

In 1987, The Kresge Foundation
reviewed 676 proposals and awarded
grants totaling $49,130,000 to 165
charitable organizations in 38 states
and the District of Columbia. Grants
are made to institutions operating in
the areas of higher education, health
care, arts and humanities, social ser-
vice, science and conservation, reli-
gion, and public policy.

The Kresge Foundation is an inde-
pendent, private foundation created by
the personal gifts of Sebastian S. Kre-
sge. It is not affiliated with any cor-
poration or organization.

they must have third year competency
in the Russian language.

Students may achieve the language
requirement either by entering W&L
with at least one year of study of Rus-
sian, or by taking their first two years
of Russian at W&L during their
freshman and sophomore years and
taking an intensive summer school
program at either UVa or Middlebury
College, which is the equivalent of a
third year, said Elrod.

Each college participating in the
exchange may send as many students
to the U.S.S.R. as it hosts. If no W&L
students meet the requirements for the
exchange, W&L may ‘‘bank unused
spots’’ for years when more students
may eligible, said Elrod.

Meanwhile, W&L is concentrating
on expanding its Russian language de-
partment. W&L submitted a proposal
to the Mellon Foundation requesting a
grant to hire two new faculty mem-
bers, one each in Russian and
Japanese studies. According to Elrod,
the proposal most likely will be accep-
ted.

Yarygin was visiting the U.S. as
part of a six member group of Soviet
academic leaders who took part in the
official signing of the exchange
agreement on March 3 at Middlebury
College in Vermont.

After the press conference, Yarygin
took a tour of W&L.

Yarygin said that this was his sec-
ond visit to the U.S. and his first visit
to rural areas of America. Yarygin
said that some aspects of Rockbridge
County reminded him of Russia.

‘This morning we were driving and
I said to the right side, it looked like
Russia. To the left side, it doesn’t look
like Russia. To the left side, there was
a big store [shopping mall],’’ said
Yarygin, noting that on the right side
there were farms.

 

Debate

(Continued from page 3

respectable 19 to 15 vote.

At Durham University, the duo
again debated the debauchery topic. In
his defense of the U.S., DeFabio
praised American cultural attain-
ments, and drew a round of applause
when he reminded the British au-
dience that the U.S. had given Elvis
Presley to Britain.

To the assertion that the U.S. mis-
treated its black citizens, Fensterman
recounted the progress in civil rights
since 1954, and reminded the British
that ‘‘we inherited the practice of
slavery’’ from them. To the argument
that ‘‘Americans cravenly worship
capitalism over equality,’’ Fenster-
man replied that a country had to pro-
duce goods and services before it
could have equality, citing the case of
the Soviet Union as an example of ‘‘a
society that stresses equality, where
consumers must stand in long lines for
basic necessities.”’

 

Appealing to the audience to apply a
reasonable standard of judgment, the
W&L team won by a voice acclama-
tion.

Halford Ryan, professor of public
speaking at W&L and coach of the de-
bate team, accompanied DeFabio and
Fensterman on their English tour. ‘‘In
preparation against possible British at-
tacks, the team had constructed
briefs,’’ stated Ryan, ‘‘but DeFabio
and Fensterman still had to reply on
impromptu debating skills throughout
the British tour.’’ He coached the
team to avoid engaging in ‘‘British-
bashing,’’ although the English de-
baters ‘‘predictably administered
overdoses of anti-Americanism,”’
Ryan stated.

**By resisting the desire to respond
in kind, the debaters won points by
appealing to the issues in the de-
bates,’’ said Ryan. ‘‘The British au-
diences appreciated the Americans’
not trading insults, their willingness to
admit faults in American society, and
their good-natured adaptations to the
British style of debating.”’

Spanish film

The W&L Film Society is
pleased to announce the presen-
tation of What Have I Done to De-
serve This? (Spain, 1984), directed
by Pedro Almodovar.

Showings will be at 8:00 p.m. in
Classroom ‘‘A’’ in Lewis Hall.
There is no charge for admission.
The film is in Spanish, with subti-
tles.

Spanish film makers are recover-
ing from the hangover of the
Franco years, and Pedro Almodo-
var is one of the young directors
leading the pack. What Have I
Done to Deserve This? is a black
comedy, with surrealistic touches,
that has been described as ‘‘a small
masterpiece...in the tradition of
Luis Bunuel.’’ A housewife in con-
temporary Spain is driven to the
edge of sanity by the bizarre beha-
vior of her family and neighbors.

If the winter doldrums have tired
you of the predictable and the
commonplace, then this off-beat
film is for you.

The W&L Film Society invites
you to join us for this presentation,
and we hope you will share our in-
vitation with students and friends.

Maturity is key to golf success

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

If you want to be successful in the
sport of golf, you have to be able to
handle pressure. For the W&L golf
team, handling pressure will be the
key to a winning season.

‘We put some pressure on oursel-
ves in the past couple of years to score
well,’’ said head coach Buck Leslie,
whose team finished a respectable
11-5-1 last year. ‘I think it has hurt
i.”

Leslie said he is stressing to his
players the importance of relaxing and
just playing the game. He said this can
only be achieved through maturity and
match experience. This year, the Gen-

Baseball team

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

 

The W&L baseball team will open
up its regular season this weekend at
home with a three-game series against
the NAIA team of West Virginia
Tech. The first game of the series will
be tomorrow afternoon on Smith Field

at 3:00, with the doubleheader on Sat-!1/:

urday- at’ 1:00. -

The Generals have played five
scrimmage games in their preseason,
including two teams on their February
Break trip to Florida, two games

erals may just have that needed matu-
rity.

Led by senior John Gammage, a
1987 all-Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference performer and all-NCAA Dis-
trict Ill player, W&L has three of its
top players returning. Helping out
Gammage, who finished in a tie for
third place in the ODAC tournament
last year, will be senior Kevin Hunt,
juniors Pete Coleman and Tom Wing-
field and sophomore Ted Fox. The
Generals were somewhat hurt when
senior Chip Gist, one of the leading
scorers for the team last season, de-
cided not to play this year.

‘‘We do have maturity—age-wise
and golf-wise,’’ said Leslie.

The Generals open their season this
weekend at the James Madison Invita-

tional on Friday and Saturday. The
22-team, five-man tournament will
feature some stiff competition and a
challenging course for W&L.

“There will be some good golf
teams there from Divisions I, IT and
IIl,”’ said Leslie. ‘‘The course is
fairly long. If you can get by the first
couple of holes on the front and back
nine in good shape, then you should
be okay.”

Leslie said the team’s preseason
preparations have gone well. The re-
cent weather, which has been excel-
lent, has been an added plus.

After the invitational, the Generals
will travel to Randolph-Macon on
Tuesday to begin their ODAC sched-
ule of play against the Yellow Jackets.

Lax defeats Macon

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L lacrosse Generals re-
bounded from Saturday’s 24-5 pound-
ing by the University of Virginia to
win their first home game, defeating
Randolph-Macon 13-6 Tuesday after
noon on Wilson Field.

The Generals fell behind early, 3-0,
but scored eight unanswered goals in
the second quarter to put the game out
of reach and give W&L its first win of
the season and a 1-0 record in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.

The slow start really wasn’t a sur-
prise. The trouncing by Virginia fol-
lowed a tough pre-season schedule
that really tested the Generals early.

But all that changed against Ran-
dolph-Macon.

After junior midfielder Joe Cac-
camo broke the ice at the 13:39 mark
in the first period, sophomore attack-
man Chris Giblin followed with his
third goal of the season, pulling the

not as successful as the team would
have liked to hope, the attitude is very
optimistic for the start of the season.

Head coach Jeff Stickley, in just his
second year, compared the status of
this year’s team at this point in the
season to last year’s team. ‘‘Right
now) iweire probably 4 little bit further
dhéad"than' we were Mst year at this
time,’’ he said.

Although all of the starting jobs are
up for grabs, the infield and the pitch-
ing staff return almost intact.

Women’s tennis ranked No. 14 in poll

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L women’s tennis team,
after a promising start in the fall, are
ready to start its spring season.

The Generals, who had a 7-0 fall re-
cord, are ranked No. 14 in the Inter-
collegiate Tennis Coaches’ Associa-
tion Division III national preseason
ranking. However, head coach Wil-
liam Washburn considers it difficult to
predict the team’s performance since
he has found that women’s tennis
teams tend to fluctuate quite a lot from
year to year. W&L has very little ex-
perience as the team has no senior and
only two juniors on its roster.

Instead, the Generals will rely on
the addition of some strong freshmen
players, four of whom, according to
Washburn, ‘‘make up the bulwark of
our top six.’’ In the fall, W&L was led
by freshman Jean Stroman, who
posted a 7-0 singles record playing at
No. 1. She also had a 6-0 doubles re-
cord playing with fellow classmate

Kathy Leake. Stroman is ranked No.
127 in the ITCA preseason rankings.

Freshman Kelly Martone had a 6-1
record playing in the No, 2 spot in the
fall. Leake was 5-1 playing at No. 3,
while sophomore Theresa Southard
was 6-1 playing at No. 4. Freshman
Shawn Wert posted a 5-1 record at the
No. 5 slot and junior Martha Christian
was 3-4 competing at No. 6.

As of now, there are no set positions
for. the spring since the team is in the
midst of challenge matches. Wash-
burn expects that eight or nine of the
twelve women trying out will play in
most of the matches particularly those
against W&L’s traditional Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference rivals.

Washburn is optimistic about the
upcoming season. ‘‘The team, as de-
monstrated in our fall program, seems
to be quite well balanced and en-
thusiastic. We should post a very good
record in the spring,’’ he said.

The Generals open their season at
home against ODAC opponent
Lynchburg on Wednesday.

The returning infielders are: senior
co-captain Eric Acra, who will play
first when not pitching; junior Harry
Halpert, who hit .329 while playing
shortstop last year; and sophomore
Robert Rimmer, who can play second
or third base.

The ace of the pitching staff should
be ‘“‘iron man’’ Carter Steuart, who,
as a junior in 1987, appeared in 12 of
the General's 22 games. He started 11
times and finished with a respectable
3.55 ERA. He was also one of the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference’s hard
luck players. At one point in the
season he pitched a two-hitter and lost

 

2-0, and in another game he lost on an
unearned run with two out in the bot-
tom of the ninth inning.

The outfield positions are still un-
determined. Junior Tom Skeen, who
led the team last year with a .388 bat-
ting average, will move from third
base to the outfield.

The Generals will also have the ad-
ded bonus of first-year law student
Hugh Finkelstein’s return to the dia-
mond. Finkelstein, who led the team
in hitting as a junior undergraduate,
has a year of eligibility remaining and
his bat and intensity will be a welcome
addition to the team.

Senior David McLeod puts away a smash against Radford

Generals to within one.

But the real turning point came less
than a minute into the second period.
Sophomore all-America defenseman
Reid Campbell left the game for a
30-second holding penalty, putting the
Yellow Jackets a man up, and Macon
came down looking to stop the W&L
comeback.

Instead, a quick shot by the Jackets
gave senior Robert Buttarazzi his first
save of the game, and the W&L goa-
lie’s outlet pass to sophomore Chris
Mastrogiovanni broke the Macon
power play and set up senior Robbie
Stanton’s tying goal less than a minute
later.

“It really was a two-goal swing,”’
said Daly. ‘‘Rather than being down
4-2, we're now tied, 3-3, and we de-
finitely have the momentum.’’ And
suddenly, the rout was on.

Just like the Washington Redskins

seemed unstoppable in the second

goals, 17 assists).

Boucher earned horiorable men-
tion status to the all-America team
last year and was named to the all-
Midwest first team after scoring 18

 

then senior Peter Smith scored, then
Giblin scored again, then junior John
Ware scored, then sophomore Carlos
Millan scored, then the half end-
ed—W&L 8, Macon 3.

The Jackets could muster only a
murmur of protest the rest of the way,
scoring two goals in the third period
and one in the fourth.

However, things were quite the op-
posite three days earlier on a sunny
afternoon in Charlottesville. After a
Giblin goal tied the game at one early
on, the Cavs took a lead they would
never relinquish.

Stanton scored unassisted to make
the score 3-2 at the 12:19 mark, but
UVa. scored twice more before the
first period ended to take a three-goal
lead.

Giblin scored unassisted to cut the
margin to two goals, but the quicker
and stronger Cavaliers answered with
13 straight goals to put the game out of
reach.

 

Generals looking for
revenge v. Bishops

goals and 13 assists.

**Without question, Toby is one
of the best pure athletes playing la-
crosse today,’’ said O-W head
coach Mike Pressler.

The Bishops also return their
leading scorer from last season,
senior attackman Rob Alvino. An-
other first team all-American, Al-
vino recorded 31 goals and 38 as-
sists in 1987.

‘*Rob might be the best attacker
ever to play at Ohio Wesleyan,’’
said Pressler. ‘‘He’s not only a
very talented offensive player but a
complete player.’’

The Bishops return all three
starting defenders, including
senior co-captain Chris Goss and
sophomore Mike Warnes, an all-
Midwest performer last season.

O-W’s one question mark may
be in the goal. Like W&L, the
Bishops lost their starting goalie to
graduation last year. Dan O'Neil,
the Division Ill Goalie-of-the- Year
in 1987, compiled a .686 save per-
centage last season.

Daly said the Bishops also have

‘some’ excellént“underclassmen to

fill in for the four starters lost to
graduation, including junior goalie
Jim Schwartz and sophomore at-
tacker Paul Sclafani.

 

Netters sweep Radford in straight sets

 

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

In their only action this week, the
W&L men’s tennis team faced Rad-
ford University on Tuesday. It was the
first time in over three years that the
teams have met. Two years ago the
match between the two teams was
rained out, and last season Radford
was not on W&L’s schedule, said
head coach Gary Franke. ‘‘We didn’t
know their strengths [coming into
Tuesday’s match],’’ he added.

The Generals may not have known
Radford’s strengths, but they ran into
little trouble during the contest. W&L
netters scored all of the nine points
possible in the match, sweeping both
the singles and doubles competitions.
All six W&L singles players and the
three doubles teams won in straight
sets.

In the opening singles action,
W&L’s No. 2 player junior Bobby
Matthews, No. 3. senior David
McCleod and No. 5 senior Chris Wi-

man all blanked their opporents—6-0,
6-0—in each case.

The story was much the same in
doubles, where the Generals once
again rolled in straight sets.

The Generals will spend the next
two and a half weeks preparing for
their biggest weekend of the season,
when the Generals have two duel mat-
ches at Swarthmore College in Penn-
sylvania. W&L will face Division III
foe Swarthmore at noon on March 26,
and another hot rival, Washington
College, on the following day at 11
a.m.

Franke stressed the importance of
the Swarthmore weekend. He said the
trip will be important in determining
D-III rankings as well as seedings at
the D-III National Championships,:to
be held at here at Washington and Lee
from May 16-22.

The Generals will see action today
against Slippery Rock on the upper
tennis courts at 3:00 p.m. The Gen-
erals will also play host to Blooms-
burg tomorrow, again at 3:00 p.m. ”

U2 is the big winner at this year’s Grammys

 

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

It could have been billed as the night
Radio City Music Hall put on a better
musical extravaganza than the one the
Apollo Theatre put on for Motown's
50th anniversary in 1983. Or maybe it
could have been billed as a revival of
‘That's Incredible,’’ where Michael
Jackson gives his first televised ap-
pearance in five years, sets the stage
on fire with his dancing, and then only
wins one minor award. Or maybe it
could have been billed as ‘‘Poetic Jus-
tice: the night U2 finally finds what
they’ve been looking for.’’

Last Wednesday night’s 30th An-
nual Grammy Award Show at Radio
City Music Hall was all of these things
and much, much more. It was an even-
ing of unbelievable music, a couple
surprises, and as always, a reunion of
today’s finest musical performers.

Even though they only won two of
the four categories they were nomi-
nated in, world phenomenon U2 came
away from the Grammys as the big
winner, winning Best Rock Group and
Album of the Year for their multi-
platinum recording, The Joshua Tree.
After winning the Album of the Year
award for their seventh album, U2’s
lead singer, Bono, humorously sum-

- med up the band’s work.

“It’s really hard carrying the weight

- of the world on your shoulders, saving
__ the whales, organizing summits be-

tween world leaders and that sort of

thing, but we like our work, ’’he said.

Since recording their first album,
Boy, U2 has gotten the reputation of
being the socially conscious band
singing about such topics as apartheid,
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and
drug abuse. U2’s awards Wednesday
night were their first Grammys.

While much of the excitement fo-
cused on U2, no one could help enjoy-
ing and appreciating the incredible
musical show that the Grammy pro-
ducers put together.

Whitney Houston, Los Lobos, Su-
zanne Vega, and comedian Jackie
Mason all performed as well as many
other performers who performed in
medley salutes to music.

A salute to the music of New York
was highlighted by live performances
from George Benson (‘‘On Broad-
way’’), Cab Calloway (‘‘Minnie the
Moocher’’), Lou Reed (‘‘A Walk on
the Wild Side’’) and Billy Joel (‘‘I’m
in a New York State of Mind’’) with
David Sanborn on saxophone. Randy
Travis’ performance of ‘‘Forever and
Ever, Amen,”’ the song that won him
two Grammy awards later in the even-
ing, was a treat as the heart of the
Country medley.

Perhaps the most amazing medley,
though, came near the end of the show
in a salute to the music of the 1940s
and 50s. Old radio rapper Jocko Hen-
derson narrated his way through one
of his old teenage radio sagas with the
help of the 50’s groups, The Cadil-
lacs, The Regents, The Flamingos,
The Angels and Dion. Time, it
seemed, had moved backward. At
least for the night.

Technicolor is in more

Color by Spice is the name of Ann
Spice’s fashion consulting service
which promotes help for the wardrobe
weary.

Spice claims that studies indicate
that ‘‘an employer decides within the
first thirty seconds of an interview
whether he is going to hire the person
or not.’ In her classes and private
consultations, Spice finds the correct
palette of colors for businessmen,
professors and their spouses, male and
female W&L students, law students,
and anyone else who wants to improve
their look, as well as their self-image.

**You can tell a lot about a person
by their dress. You can usually tell
what their personality is like, what
their economic and family background
is, and their education level,’’ said
Spice.

Her job is to teach people how to
dress for the job they want to get, or
how to look more professional in their
chosen career. She has given talks at
the law school concerning what is ap-
propriate dress for interviews.

‘*Being conservative along with ex-
pressing personality is the secret,’’
she said.

Spice, who considered representing
a color consultation company, chose

 

not to because, she explained, ‘‘I
would have had to charge a $55 to $60
fee for the first consultation, and I
know this area of the country wouldn’t
support that. I wanted to appeal to a
wide variety of people—students,
professors’ wives, grocery store
checkers, etc.”’

For a private consultation, she
charges $30, while a class costs $25.
If an individual calls her and wants to
be in a class but has no other compan-
ions who want their colors done, then
Spice will find others to fill the class.
Classes are usually only four people in
size.

Spice has been in this business for
seven years. Before that, she taught
economics at Southern Seminary. She
first learned about color theory in col-
lege while working on her economics
degree.

Sewing students were taught to sew
clothes that were going to complement
their individual coloring. Spice’s
business sprung forth when she car-
ried that tracition into the classroom at
Southern Seminary.

“It just spread,’’ explains Spice. ‘‘I
got calls from stores, classes, bridge
clubs, so I decided to stop teaching
and make it my main business. ’’

She continued, ‘‘I’ve gone to a lot
of workshops and classes in Washing-
ton, and trained with people in
different companies, so I could gather
together what I thought was the best.”’

Her program is based upon a
seasonal color analysis, which means

‘There is no question though, that
the most electrifying performance
came when Michael Jackson took the
stage.

The audience's first look at Jackson
came as his silouetted form began do-
ing Jacksonesque dance steps behind a
paper wall. As the wall started moving
up, Jackson started getting down.
First he danced to a recording of ‘‘The
Way You Make Me Feel,”’ from his
current smash album Bad,and then
sang ‘‘The Man in the Mirror,’’ from
the same LP, with gospel great Andre
Crouch and a robed chorus in the
background.

As Jackson hit the floor on his knees
at the end of the song, the audience
jumped to its feet. Even though the
only award Jackson’s Bad album
would win would be for sound engi-
neering, the crowd let him know that
they loved his music. Jackson was
back in the spotlight again.

While the performances offered cer-
tain surprises, so did the awards.
While six people were double win-
ners, the rest of the awards seemed to
be scattered rather evenly among the
big names attending the ceremony.

Paul Simon won Record of the Year
for Graceland, Bruce Springsteen
won Best Male Rock Vocal for ‘*Tun-
nel of Love,’’ and Sting won Best Pop
Vocal for *‘Bring on the Night.”’

The Best New Artist award went to
Jody Watley, Best Comedy Recording
to Robin Williams, and Best Musical
Cast Show Album to Les Miserables.

Narada Michael Walden won Pro-
ducer of the Year honors for Whitney

The Ring-tum Phi, March 10, 1988

Houston’s second album Whitney.
Best Rhythm and Blues Male went to
Smokey Robinson while perennial
favorite, and this year double winner,
Aretha Franklin won the female R&B
award, proving once again why she is
considered the Queen of Soul.

Other double award winners in ad-
dition to U2 and Aretha Franklin in-
cluded ‘‘Somewhere Out There’’ (the
theme from the Motion Picture An
American Tail), and Itzhak Perlman,
Robert Shaw, and Vladimir Horowitz
for his landmark recording Horowitz
in Moscow, taped last spring on Hor-
witz’s first trip to the Soviet Union
since his defection 40 years ago.

Horowitz also received the Presi-
dent’s Award of Merit from Alfred
W. Slezenger, President of the Acad-
emy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
In response, Horowitz remarked,
“I’m glad to see there is still apprecia-
tion for classical music.”’

While Wynton Marsalis won for
Best Jazz Group, other Jazz awards
went to the Pat Methany Group, Diane
Schuur and the Count Basie Orches-
tra, Dexter Gordon for The Other Side
of Round Midnight, Mercer Ellington
and Bobby McFerrin for Best Male
Jazz Vocal.

Second year Grammy host Billy
Crystal asked the audience repeatedly
throughout the night ‘‘Isn’t this some
show we’re having?’’ The answer was
simple. The Grammy awards were
more than just awards this year. They
were a celebration of music, of social
consciousness, and of the unity shared
by those people making today’s mu-

sic.

than just movies

that people’s colors coincide with a
season of the year.

Autumns and Springs are people
with yellow-gold skin tones. Winters
and Summers have grey-blue under-
tones. Spice chooses which category a
person falls under by looking at skin,
hair and eye color.

60 percent of men are color-blind to
some extent, according to Spice, so
she shows them how to put together
their shirts, ties and jackets.

Once they know their color palette,
matching the colors is:easy because all
of a season’s colors are coordinated.
She also teaches them which ties are
formal, casual, and sporty, as well as
analyzing their face shape to see
which glasses and hair style will look
best.

Women are offered two classes. In
the first one, they receive a book of
swatches which includes their best
colors (men also receive a book), a
sheet telling which make-up is best for
them, and what kind of jewelry will
look good on them.

The second class involves instruc-
tion on wardrobe planning, determin-
ing whether or not one is under- or
overdressed, more make-up planning,
and analyzing hair style, hair color,
face shape, and clothing personality.

In big cities, Spice claims, as many
men as women are having their colors
done but are charged more for it be-
cause companies are paying to have it

done. After one of her clients in-
creased his number of sales, she was
hired by that company to analyze 150
engineers.

One man told her that he could get
dressed in the dark now because
everything mixes and matches.

Margaret Pimblett, who _partici-
pated in one of Spice’s classes,
suggests students have their colors
done. ‘‘I think it’s a good idea for col-
lege students to get their colors analy-
zed because we’re starting to get into
investment clothing...just so you
won’t make an expensive mistake,
find out what’s right for you.”’

“I’m glad I did it,’’ agrees Lisabeth
Fowler, another member of Mar-
garet’s class. ‘‘It was very interesting.
I recommend that people try it. It gave
me confidence that what I was wear-
ing was right as far as colors were
concerned.”’

“‘Everything you wear should
flatter and energize you,’’ asserts
Spice. “‘The two biggest pluses from
this program is that it helps you look
your best and gives you an organized
approach to your clothing selection. It
saves you money in the long run. It
saves time and lessens the chance for
mistakes.”’

Carole Jackson, author of the Color
Me Beautiful books, advises that ‘‘if
you look beautiful on the outside and
feel wonderful on the inside, then you
can be truly excited about yourself and
your personal gifts.”’

A Reagan supporter from 1980.

 

By Wendy Wolford
Staff Reporter

 

The run-off election for Secre-
tary of the Executive Committee
continued to be a close race be-
tween Alston Parker and Edward
Yu, but Yu captured the position
with 52 percent of the vote. Turn-
out for Thursday’s election,
however, decreased to 56 percent
of the student body from the 67
percent turnout in the first election
on March 7.

Anticipating the upcoming year,

 

 

By Perry Hayes/The Ring-tum Phi

Yu says he plans to attend several
EC meetings this spring to become
more familiar with his responsibili-
ties. He said he will also work with
Mark Chiappara, present EC se-
cretary, rather closely to facilitate
a smoother transition.

In addition to the usual secretar-
ial duties, Yu said one of his main
goals will be to assist the President
and Vice-President in fulfilling
their responsibilities. Moreover,
he said he foresees that possible
proposals from the White Book
Revision Committee will create
additional work.°

1988 Mock Convention set to begin;
Young to deliver Keynote Address

From Staff Reports

 

The 19th W&L Mock Democratic
Convention will take place Friday and
Saturday, March 25 & 26 in the War-
ner Center.

The convention event will feature a
keynote address by Atlanta Mayor and
former U.S. Representative to the
United Nations Andrew Young. Other
highlights will include speeches by

Virginia Governor Gerald Baliles and’

former Governor Chuck Robb, as
well as Arkansas Governor William
Clinton, and a parade through down-
town Lexington, in addition to the
nomination of presidential and vice-
presidential candidates.

Nearly 200 students have been
working for more than two years
planning the event, which will get
under way Friday, March 25 at 10
a.m. with the traditional Mock Con-
vention parade through downtown
Lexington.

Each of the 54 state delegations has
built a float for the parade. The parade
will assemble at Brewbaker Field at

Yu edges Parker for EC Secretary

Although Parker did not win the
election, she said she thinks she
was successful. Said Parker, **be-
cause I got so close to winning with
only 48 votes difference says some-
thing about the fact that attitudes
toward women are changing at
W&L.”

In successfully reaching students
who formerly had anti-coed senti-
ments, Parker has been encouraged
to run as a Senior Representative.
Although she was not elected Se-
cretary, she said she would still
like to serve the university as a rep-
resentative.

Lexington High School and wind its
way to Main Street, where it will head
north. The parade will then turn left
onto Washington Street before finish-
ing at the Warner Center.

In addition to the imaginative and
diverse floats—each based on a theme
relating to that particular state—the
parade will feature bands from several
area schools, an appearance by Miss
Virginia 1986, and other special at-
tractions. The parade is expected to
last about one-and-a-half hours.

The first session of the Mock Con-
vention will begin at | p.m. Friday in
the Warner Center. Following wel-
coming remarks by President John D.
Wilson and Lexington Mayor Charles
Phillips, Rep. Jim Olin will deliver a
brief address on behalf of the Sixth
Virginia District.

Lt. Goy. Douglas Wilder and Gov.
Baliles will welcome the delegates on
behalf of the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia. Their remarks will precede the
greetings from the Democratic party
to the Mock Convention.

Amnesty is
‘doing well’

By Jon Ryan
Staff Reporter

 

 

The W&L chapter of Amnesty
International is doing well, according
to organizer Kevin McNamara.

The group held its fourth meeting
and second letter writing session
Tuesday night.

According to McNamara, turnout
for the meetings is around 80 people,
both students, faculty, and townspeo-
ple. Generally, he said, 40 to 50 write
letters.

The group is open to everyone who
wishes to join. McNamara said letters
have been written to local churches to
try to garner support from the town.

Local support, he said, is necessary
to continue the letter writing campaign
over the summer.

McNamara said letters are sent out
in response to urgent action notices

Is the White Book too regulated?
Should the Honor Code include beha-
viors other than those concerned with
lying, cheating, and stealing? Should
the bad-standing clause be changed?

Honor Code?

These questions are just a few of the
topics debated at the Wednesday,
March 9 Honor Forum held by mem-

White Book Revisions Committee asks for student input

methods of contact with the committee
are through suggestion boxes in the
co-op, undergraduate library, and
ARA lounge at the Law School.

Although attendance was low, the
debate was strong with many topics
covered. The three main procedural
topics discussed were the bad-standing
clause, the time allotted to prepare a
defense, and the handling of the jury
decision.

There was much criticism for the
clause which penalized those students
who appealed their case to an open
trial by placing the message ‘‘not in
good standing’ on the transcript of
those found guilty, while those stu
dents who withdrew after being found
guilty in the closed hearing conducted
by EC were punished merely by
having ‘‘good standing’’ whited off
the transcript.

Law advocates, those law students
who prepare the defense for the ac
cused, wanted to change the wording
of the procedure for determining the
time the accused was granted for his
defense. Law advocates at the meeting
claimed that 48 hours was not always
sufficient to locate witnesses and pre-
pare for the defense.

Root said that the clause protected
the witness from having to ‘‘sweat it
out,’” and that he always extended the
preparation time when there was a
need.

Questions concerning whether jury
members should be allowed to take

notes during the open trials, should
they receive written instructions, and
should the *4 vote be changed to a
% vote were also debated. Arguments
against the jury members being al-
lowed to take notes included the opin-
ion that note taking distracted the
juror from absorbing all the informa-
tion presented.

Greg Dale, a member of the Honor
Committee and former juror, com-
mented that ‘it would have been nice
to have the charge written down be-
cause we forgot what the charge was
exactly.’ Furthermore, he felt that a
*A vote was “‘insufficient to determine
guilt.”’

The forum discussed the philo-
sophical question of whether or not to
turn the White Book into a rule book
of specific don’ts or to keep the Honor
System as it is—a personal honor code
that is simply defined by the command
“‘do not lie, cheat or steal.”’

**People when they come here are
not all going to have the same philo-
sophical views,’’ cautioned Tom
Reems. :

Also in response, Hugh Finkelstein,
next year’s EC vice- president, argued
that “honor is not purely academic.
You can’t turn it on and off.”’

Falk agreed, ‘‘If date rape occurs at
home, it’s still dishonorable. *’

The question of whether or not di
shonorable conduct such as date rape
should be handled by the EC or con

tained with the conduct committee

was also considered.

Dittman expressed concern that stu-
dents felt that ‘the honor system says
do not lie, cheat, or steal, and as long
as we avoid contact with these things,
we're safe from the honor system. As
long as we avoid anything that
‘smacks’ of that, then we're being
honorable.’

Root pointed out that the honor
book itself states that ‘“‘The Honor
System is not intended to govern
minor infractions of the University’s
or society’s regulations, but only acts
that indicate a student is not worthy of
trust by his or her peers.”’

He said that statement is ‘‘what
makes our honor system unique, cher-
ished, and the best tradition. ’’ He con-
tinued further to say ‘‘I feel confident
that we [the EC] are able to determine
what is dishonorable and not worth
trust.”’

Many more views and rules were
questioned, and the Revisions Com-
mittee welcomes all opinions. They
encourage students to contact them
and express their ideas about our
Honor System.

The committee members are: John
Falk and Richard Tomkins, co-chairs;
Greg Dale; Thomas Sheehan; Jeff
Burton; John Touchton; John Wil-
liamson; Shawn Copeland; Tom
Reems; Margaret Pimblett; Chuck
Murray; Mike Hassinger; and Scott
McArrow. They meet every Monday
at8 p.m

Clinton will open the second session,
beginning at 7 p.m.

Robb is currently Chairman of the
Democratic Leadership Council and
was extremely instrumental in the
formation of the ‘‘Super Tuesday”
primary elections. Clinton was first
elected governor of Arkansas in 1979,
and has served in that office contin-
uously since 1983. He is a member of
the Democratic National Committee,
and in 1987 was Chairman of the
National Governor’s Association.

Clinton’s address will precede the
platform debate Friday evening. A
Mock Convention committee, chaired
by Paul Miles, a sophomore from
Montgomery, Ala., has prepared a
platform report similar to the one
which the Democrats will debate at
their July convention in Atlanta.

Mock Convention delegates will
debate and vote on various planks of
the platform, which will be a combina-
tion of Democratic stances and W&L
student opinion.

The final session, at which the
nominees will be chosen, will get

under way at 9 a.m. Saturday.

Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young will
deliver the keynote address that morn-
ing. Young, who served as U.N. am-
bassador under Jimmy Carter, has
been major of Atlanta since 1982. He
is credited with much of Atlanta’s un
precedented economic growth and de-
velopment during that time. The selec-
tion of Atlanta as the site of the 1988
Democratic National Convention is a
recognition of Atlanta's significant
progress under Young’s administra-
tion.

Following Young's speech, the ac-
tual nominating process will begin.
The student delegates will attempt, by
roll-call voting, to accurately predict
the presidential and vice-presidential
nominees that will be chosen by the
Democrats in Atlanta this summer.

The final session is expected to end
in the early afternoon.

The 1,679 delegates include stu-
dents from W&L’s undergraduate and
law schools, as well as from some of

Two students organize

Contra Aid

discussion

held in Lee Chapel

By Andy Nixon
Staff Reporter

 

As the debate over Contra Aid con-
tinues on Capitol Hill, a forum held
last Thursday in Lee Chapel also dis-
cussed the issue of funding the Con-
tras.

The discussion was organized by
two W&L students, junior Bob
Tompkins and first year law student
John Falk.

Tompkins said he was ‘‘pleased
with the outcome of the panel discus-
sion.”

The panel consisted of four profes-
sors from different departments.

The four panelists were Associate
Professor of Law William Geimer,
Professor of History at VMI Blair
Turner, Assistant Professor of History
J. David Parker, and Professor of
Economics Bruce Herrick. Loren
Craner, a legislative assistant to Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) was scheduled
to participate, but was unable to at-
tend. Steve Hammond, a law student
at W&L and an active in the U.S.
Marine Corps moderated the panel.

Although the panel unanimously
opposed aid to the Contras, the variety
of perspectives offered by the pane-
lists provided several sides to the Con-
tra Aid issue.

Said Tompkins, ‘“‘We could have
gone with a balanced panel and sacri-
ficed the knowledge the four panelists
had, but we decided to go with the
people who knew the most.”

Geimer began the discussion with
observations from the time he spent in
Nicaragua. Based on his experience in
the country Geimer said ‘‘the Contras
kill civilians.’ He went on to oppose
several popular arguments in favor of
Contra Aid such as: ‘‘Nicaraguans
will be better in the long run,”’ and
that ‘‘ Nicaragua is a threat to Browns-
ville, Texas.””

Geimer then quoted Webster's de
finition of arrogance and said, ‘*Web-
ster could not have better defined
United States foreign policy for the
last 150 years.”’

Turner spoke next and introduced
the historical relationship between Ni-
caragua and the U.S. into the discus-
sion. Turner discussed the military
presence the U.S. has had in the coun-
try. and its support and installation of
the Samosa regime.

He reviewed how August Sandino,
from which comes the name Sandin-
ista, and his followers came to power.

Turner’s main thrust against Contra
aid stemmed from the cultural ties
which developed between Nicaragua
and the U.S., and a belief that nations
have a certain right to ‘‘self- de-
termination.”

Parker continued the ‘‘self-
determination theme’’ and said that
when dealing with the Sandinista
government the ‘United States should
do business with them.”

Parker said, ‘‘The United States
wants responsible, stable, _ self-
respecting governments which are not
communist.’’ He added, ‘‘the odds of
the United States opposing a Marxist
government in Central America are
100 percent,’’ and that ‘‘this forces
these nations to militarize imme-
diately.”

According Parker, U.S. opposition
to communism has had nominal suc-
cess in Central America and another
policy ought to be considered.

Herrick spoke next on serious prob-
lems in the Nicaraguan economy.
Herrick said the U.S. should ‘‘send
massive jolts of foreign aid to the cur-
rent government,”

All four panelists opposed U.S.
intervention against the Sandinistas
and said the U.S. ought to operate
with the current government.

The panel did not decide whether
the Arias Peace Plan, or other
measures, could help the violent re-
gion, but agreed any plan which halted
aid to the Contras would improve the
situation greatly.

Tompkins said he thought ‘‘the
knowledge [the panelists] shared will
help people in a further evaluation of
the situation in Nicaragua.”

The discussion was taped and will
be broadcast on Cable Channel 9 in
the near future.

How to become an evangelist, according to Sbar

 

MY VIEW
By John Sbar

 

My recent five day absence from the
campus caused a state of euphoria
among students, administrators,
professors and Lexington politicians
who want to beautify the city. But,
like all euphorias it had to end some
time.

I didn’t transfer, I wasn’t expelled,
and I stayed out of jail. Actually, I
was attending a very important sem-
inar for aspiring evangelists, and for
the sake of the W&L community, I
will cover the important themes.

To become a God-certified evange-
list one only has to follow three simple
rules,

Rule 1: Participate in a sordid sex-
ual encounter.

Rule 2: Deny involvement in the
sordid sexual encounter on the 6 0’-
clock news.

Rule 3: After the police videotape of

 

 

 

 

more

the sordid sexual encounter is shown
on the 6 o'clock news, confess and ask
God's forgiveness.

Jimmy Swaggart did a fine job with
rules two and three but he had a little
trouble with rule one. He paid a pros-
titute to perform some sort of specta-
tor-stimulating activity which is bad
because rule one specifically says,
‘Participate in a sordid sexual en-
counter.’’ It does not say, ‘“Watch
someone perform a sordid sexual ac-
tion.’’ Obviously Swaggart needs to
do an internship with Jimmy Baker
who participated in enough sordid
sexual encounters to start his own
soap opera. Baker even invented rule
‘2: Be driven to sordid sexual encoun-
ter by a wife who buys mascara in fer-
tilizer bags.

Although Swaggart violated rule
one, his activities did benefit the
scientific community. The winner of
next years Nobel Prize in Science will
answer this biophysical question:
‘*What were the spectator stimulating
activities Swaggart paid to see?

Important news flash: unidentified
sources (George Bush) have identified

. \/ This sni Pee is

une Pik, im.

two major components used by ‘the
prostitute Swaggart hired to perform.
The mysterious Spectator Stimulating
Activity—a pogo stick and a nerf foot-
ball.

Another evangelist is doing some-
thing even more disgusting than Baker
in order to satisfy rule one—he’s run-
ning for president. The readers who
don’t think running for president is
sordid and sexual enough to satisfy
rule one had never heard of Gary Hart
either. The most tragic aspect of the
evangelist who is running for presi-
dent, besides the fact that we have to
hear his speeches, is that he isa W&L
alumnus.

I apologize to the readers who were
never told that Republican candidate
and famous evangelist Pat Robertson
was educated at W&L. (Important
fact: this is the first true statement I
have ever written). It’s an outrage but
it’s true. The administration has engi-
neered a full scale Pat Robertson
cover-up. Here’s how the cover up

works.

Student: Dean Ogolthrope, does
WA&L have any famous alumni?

Dean Ogolthrope: Boy, where have
you been?! We have more famous
alumnus than the Honor Code has vio-
lations. Haven't you heard about the
four best-selling writers or the six su-
preme court justices or the eighteen
senators or the twenty magazine edi-
tors Or...

Student: Is it true that a famous
evangelist and presidential candidate
went here?

Dean O: Let me get back to you on
that, my teeth need immediate floss-
ing.

Before you chastise the administra-
tion for covering up Robertson’s
alumni status, consider the conse-
quences of the nation knowing the
truth.

Melvin Doital: (high school senior
from Wisconsin—genius and star ath-
lete). Well Mom and Dad, I've
reached a decision, I’m turning down

that full scholarship from Harvard to
go to W&L. Academically W&L is as
strong as any Ivy League school and
it’s a heck of a lot more fun. Harvard
doesn’t have Fancy Dress, Mock
Convention and six fraternities for
every 100 students; not to mention...

Mr. Doital: Excuse me for raining
on your parade Melvin, but did you
know that Pat Robertson went to
W&L?

Melvin: You mean the evangelist
running for president?
Dr. Doital: That's the one.

Like all scholar athletes, Melvin has
a vivid imagination and starts envi-
sioning himself at W&L. Instead of
wild parties he sees Bible study from
6:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.; classes from
noon until 6:00 p.m.; more Bible
study from 6:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.
and lights out at midnight.

Melvin: I hear Boston is a great
city.

The cover up was working fine until
Robertson’s campaign got to South
Carolina. The Washington Post re-
cently quoted Robertson during a
speech explaining his Southern

lineage, ‘‘I'm the only [candidate] ;

who went to college where Robert E.
Lee was president.’’

Robert had many interesting things »

to say in this speech. For example, he

accused Republican rival George Bush |
of engineering the Swaggart incident »

to hurt Robertson’s campaign. When
reporters asked him for evidence he

replied that he had no evidence but '

feels that it is true. He sounds like the

Attorney General Edwin Meese, who |
has no evidence but feels that porno- '
graphy causes all sexually-related .

crimes. You should use this logic with

your professors, ‘‘I have no evidence *

as to why I deserve an ‘‘A’’ in your
class but I feel like I should get one.”’

LETTERS |

Alumnus writes about W&L and date rape

The Student Body, Faculty, and Alumni:

For the past two years I have chaired a state-
wide, United Methodist task force on child sexual
abuse. In the course of our investigation, the issue
of date rape came up. While peripheral to the task
force’s concerns, the subject caused me, as an
alumnus of W&L, some belated feelings of guilt.
Hence this letter.

I graduated from W&L in 1973 after four years
of work, fun, and learning. Having attended all
male schools since I was thirteen, I decided to re-
verse that personal trend and enrolled in the gra-
duate program at Hollins College.

Hollins proved an enlightening experience. For
the first time in my life women were more than
just occupants of a distant and alluring world, they
became my every day companions and, in many
cases, close friends. As friends will, some of my
fellow students at Hollins began to confide in me.
What they had to say sometimes surprised and
saddened me.

When I attended W&L, dates were drawn from
the women’s colleges surrounding the area. It
seemed some benevolent god had ordained that all
such colleges would be placed just close enough to
allow us to pick up our companions on a Friday
afternoon, but far enough away to preclude our re-
turning them after a long night of carousing. And

so we took them home to our apartments for the

night. :

The student body of W&L in those years pre-
sented the world with a unique image for a college
community: there was the atmosphere of relaxed
social mores and experimentation common to
most university campuses in the late sixties and
early seventies, but at W&L this atmosphere was
tempered by the ethical standards of General
Lee’s honor code. Honesty was everything. Hon-
esty in our incessant political discussions, honesty
in our friendships, honesty in Southeast Asia,
honesty in our faculty, and honesty in our love
lives. If one wished to make love with a woman,
one was honest about it (we probably would have
said ‘‘up front’’ about it) and she, in turn, was ex-

pected to be honest about her desires. If none

were present (and believe me, I sadly but quickly
discovered this to be my usual lot), well, that was

‘‘cool,’’ we’d just sack out on opposite sides of
the bed and in the morning, gentlemen that we

were, we would drive them back to Sweet Briar,
Randolph-Macon, Hollins, or wherever.
It was understood that just because circumstan-

ces made it easier for your date to sleep over did

not necessarily mean you would engage in sexual

intercourse with said date. We were young and
idealistic and more than willing to put out ideals
into practice in this way. It was the corrupt society
of our parents’ generation that said a man couldn’t
occupy the same bed with a woman without forc-
ing himself upon her. We were different. We

were actively creating a better world.

Or at least I had thought we were until I began
attending classes at Hollins. The women at Hol-
lins taught me many wonderful things, but they

also taught me some rather sad facts about reality.
They taught me there were W&L students whose
concept of honor was terribly flawed, students
who might adhere religiously to the code as re-
gards academics or personal property, but refused
to sustain their commitment to honorable behavior
when they had a female in their bedroom. I met
women at Hollins who had been raped by W&L
students.

The fact that these rapes had, for the most part,

all occurred in beds, beds which the women had
willingly entered, meant of course their victims

wouldn’t have stood a chance in a court of law.

But that doesn’t make them any less rapes, thefts
of these women’s dignity and, in many cases, the

psychological well-being.

We were taught that as W&L students were ex-
pected to live up to a higher ideal than the merely

legal expectations society places upon its mem-
bers. We were to neither lie, cheat,

law. We were to behave at all times as gentlemen.
And a gentleman didn’t do such things. Ever,

This high standard for behavior was and is a gift
W&L gives its students. Those of us who are now
alumni continue to try to live up to this ideal in a
society that frequently labels such concepts old-
fashioned and out-of-step. Though we may some-
times be considered naive, the honor code has gi-
ven us a sense of who we are and what we stand
for that is sorely lacking in today’s materialistic
world. Such a code should not be sullied by a few
dolts who would use their greater size and the ab-
sence of any legal restraints to steal from a woman

one of her most basic possessions: her sense of

physical security.

When I learned of these rapes I was young and
inexperienced, As a graduate of W&L I apolo-
gized on behalf of my alma mater for such beha-

nor
steal...regardless of whether or not we could be
held accountable for such actions in a court of

vior. It never occurred to me I might do more.
Then, years later, came my service on the task
force. When date rape was discussed I re-
membered those long ago conversations and I
resolved to write this letter. Probably it is years
late. Probably the school has long since developed
a program to teach incoming male freshmen all
the ramifications of being a gentleman. But just in
case it hasn’t, I hereby recommend such instruc-
tion.

At my freshman orientation in the fall of 1969 a
significant portion of the schedule was devoted to
the honor code. Hours were spent discussing the
intricacies of what did and did not constitute a vio-
lation. And yet I don’t remember a single mention
being made of a W&L gentleman’s responsibili-
ties toward that favorite preoccupation of all
W&L men since the days of Liberty Hall: women.

But you had better believe we talked about them
back in our rooms at night. I remember one fellow
explaining to a group of us credulous freshmen
that all women ‘‘wanted it’’ and, when they said
“*no,’’ they really meant ‘‘yes.’’ I would love to
claim I saw through such claptrap, but I’m afraid I
didn’t. I was confused. At seventeen years of age
women were still quite a mystery to me and, as a
result, I just didn’t know. Thankfully I never ac-
ted upon such advice, but clearly some of my
peers did. i

Fourteen years ago I received my master’s de-
gree from Hollins and moved on. I, have long
since forgotten the names of the women who
shared with me that they had been raped. Nor
could I now say how many women told me of such
an experience. I can with certainty however say it
was more than one. Let’s be conservative and say
it was only two women. Assuming I became close
to twenty women at Hollins during my year there
and then making the additional assumption that fu-
lly half of these would have chosen to share such
an intimate detail with me had they ever been
raped, this means that out of a sample of ten
women who could have shared such an experience
with me had it occurred, one-fifth of them did.
While I’m sure this is far from being a valid statis-
tical sample, it scares the daylights out of me
nevertheless.

We can’t do anything for those women, but we
can for today’s, including those wonderful new
W&L women. If we don’t have a required pro-
gram for incoming freshmen on sexual ethics,
let’s start one. If a statement hasn’t been made to
the effect that it is an honor code violation to rape
a woman, let’s make that statement and let’s make
it now. It is W&L’s heritage, its ability to produce
whole, caring, and intelligent human beings, that
we will protect thereby.

Women support frats

To the Editor:

In response to the recent rush revision propo-
sals, we, a segment of the female student body,
would like to encourage the administration to re-
address their motives and goals for the revision. A
supposed complaint and reason for the change in
the rush process has been that the women claim to
be neglected in the fraternity system and unsatis-
fied with its abilities to provide them with a suita-
ble social outlet.

Contrary to the administration’s beliefs, there
exists a large number of women not only satisfied
with the fraternity system, but quite happy with it
and would even appreciate the administration
restoring it with its previous privileges and inde-
pendence of past years.

The destruction of one of W&L’s strongest tra-
ditions would not provide many women with a
more enjoyable way of life. A better solution
would be for the administration to quit focusing its
spring cleaning on the fraternity system, and in-
stead address the creation of possible new social
groups that would meet the needs of students ex-
pressing discontent. The fraternity system offers a
necessary social outlet. Perhaps the administra-
tion is not taking into account the fact that Lexing-
ton, Virginia offers no social outlets for any stu-
dent under the age of twenty- one.

One of W&L’s greatest attractions over col-
leges comparable in educational reputation is its
healthy mix of social activity with academic con-
cern. When the faculty of W&L attempts to inflate
academia by deflating the social scene, it is, in
fact, altering the delicate balance and age-old
image of W&L that has been drawing students
from all over for years. In order to continue
W&L’s unique superiority, it must conform to
and retain some of the vital traditions familiar to
both the alumni and the present student body. A

reconstruction of the school’s social system can
not possibly generate anything but resentment
from recent alumni and disappointment from cur-
rent students. Let’s be honest, academically
speaking this school is nothing less than rigorous,
and a place to blow off steam is essential.

We hope our outlook will be seriously reviewed
and sincerely considered by the administration.
Admittedly, we do not represent the entire female
population.on campus but neither do those who
oppose the fraternity system.

Thank you for your consideration,

Diskette clarification

Dear Editor:
I am writing in response:to'the disgruntled stu-
dent in last week’s issue of The Ring-tum Phi who

lost his diskette. In his letter, the student commen-
ted on the Computer Center’s so-called policy of
lost diskettes. According to this student, when the
Computer Center assistants find a diskette in a
computer lab around campus, they either confis-
cate the diskette after a week and recycle it or they
throw it away. The actual policy of the Computer
Center with diskettes found in the labs is to leave
them there on one of the tables for the people to
claim. Many of the labs, such as Newcomb,
Payne and the library, have had diskettes lying
around for an entire term without the Computer
Center taking them.

Besides making incorrect generalizations about

the policies of the Computer Center, this student
expects the computer lab assistants to pick up after
him. The Computer Center has much more impor-
tant things to do then following people around,
like this student, and reminding them they have
misplaced their diskettes. This student should be
grateful to attend a University where an abun-
dance of micro-computers are available to use.
The least he can do is keep track of his valuable
diskette or even better make a back-up of his pre-
cious documents.

In conclusion, this student’s problem should not
be addressed to the Computer Center, but rather
to the students who use the micro-computer labs
so often. I know many people don’t own the new,
expensive and smaller diskettes and if they see a
diskette lying around the lab, many would use it to
print out their documents. What happens after
that, lies in the hands of the Executive Committee
and not in those of the Computer Center.

A political FD

Micro-Computer Assistant

To the Editors:

I came back to W&L for Fancy Dress full of
grand expectations. When I arrived, however, I
found that Fancy Dress has become nothing more
than a political battleground. Our grand tradition
stretching back eighty-one years has been tarni-
shed by controversy. What really is the con-
troversy? I think there is none. A Civil War theme
stressing the rebuilding and healing of America,
should not be offensive. This is an important part
of our heritage, showing that Americans can work
in harmony for the common good.

I think there is something, however, that fueled
this political fracas. It seems that at W&L, it is
fashionable for the Civil War to be ongoing.
WAKE UP, YOU POOR DELUDED PEOPLE,

would stop trying to live in the past, I think W&L
would be a better place. To consciously reenact
the Civil War is stupid. Reenactment occurs in
theatre, not normal society. We should learn from
the past, now wallow in it.

On a parting note, why did the MSA students
protest this theme? To be consistent, they should
boycott every possible theme that can be based on
American history. I doubt the MSA students
would do it. They just chose this event, this
theme, to make a political statement on campus.
Let’s keep Fancy Dress out of the political strug-
gles that divide students. Let it be simple...our
party...a good time for all.

Sniper shoots at police officers

 

By Cheryl Bowles
Staff Reporter

 

Two Lexington police officers were
driving south on Jefferson Street when
their car was believed to have been
shot at early Saturday morning, ac-
cording to Bruce M. Beard, Lexing-
ton’s chief of police.

Neither man was harmed, but as

the new Rush proposals were being
considered.

‘*The faculty sees rush and pledging
as affecting academic life on cam-
pus,”’ and because ‘‘the trustees have
delegated authority to the faculty for
student life on campus’’ there arises a
need to review rush, said John.

The faculty delegated the power to
review Rush to the Student Affairs
Committee. The faculty can remove
that power, but, for now, the power
remains with the ten members of
SAC.

John also mentioned a petition with

Ruley approached the traffic light at
West Washington Street, the front
window on the passenger side of the
car was shattered, said Beard.

The police found a spent cartridge
from a .300-caliber magnum in the
street in the area where the car was
hit, Beard said, but the slug itself has
not yet been found.

116 faculty signatures. He said it
reads, in part, there is an ‘‘academic

advantage to deferring rush until the

winter term.””

The proposals themselves differ as

to when formal Rush will occur.

The first option has rush running
from September 9 through September
18, with ten rush dates, ten open

houses, and several invitation parties.

The second option, on the other
hand, has an informal rush starting on
September 17 and running through the
26th. This will be followed on Oc-

tober 7 by an informal deferred rush.

Experts are sent to verify reports of
" disappearances, imprisonment, or tor-
+ ture, he said.
According to McNamara, they
” double and triple check the facts be-
+ fore reporting back to the Denver of-
fice.
Once the Denver office receives
* word, he said, it wires the notices al-
most immediately.
Generally, McNamara said, the let-
_« ters are just of couple of paragraphs
, addressed to prison wardens or heads
of state to let them know people real-

 

ize what is happening.

Amnesty International’s letter writ-
ing campaign is only part of what the
organization does. According to
McNamara, it also tries to educate.

**Amnesty is here to educate you,
not brainwash you,”’ he said.

The biggest controversy facing the
W&L chapter of Amnesty Interna-

sctional:is:the U.S. death penalty, said
McNamara. The organiZzation’s meet-
ing two weeks ago examined the death
penalty, and it was a heated discus-
sion.

According to McNamara, he is try-
ing to move the group away from the
death penalty issue right now, to let it
stabilize.

‘*People have a gut reaction [about
the death penalty]; they think it’s
right.’’

Amnesty International opposes the
death penalty, but individuals are free
to pick and choose what topics they

will write on.

**You don’t necessarily have to
agree with Amnesty on the death pen-
alty to support it on other issues,”’
said McNamara.

The group is looking for help, both
in manpower and in donations to pay
for envelopes and stamps.

McNamara appeared before the
Executive Committee several weeks
ago to request funding. His request

was denied because the EC was hesi-

tant to fund so controversial a group

with student tax money.

McNamara initially did most of the
work to start the group and keep it
rolling, but as he says,‘‘It’s a group
effort, not an individual thing.

“One person can write maybe 10

letters, but 10 people can write 100.”
He repeated a quote from a prisoner
who was released after torture:
“It’s the accumulated weight of the
feathers that sinks the boat.”’

forces were called in, and several
streets were blocked off from the pub-
lic for approximately two hours.

Approximately two dozen officers
gathered around the bullet shell as it
was collected as evidence.

Kutz refused to talk about the inci-
dent until the investigation is over.

The police department requests that
anyone who believes he has informa-
tion about the Saturday morning inci-
dent call the police at 463-2112.

The actual formal rush will begin in
the first week in January. Pledging
will occur at that time, and would last
eight weeks for all fraternities.

The chief debate, however,
centered around the minimum GPA
necessary to initiate into a fraternity.

In both proposals a 1.9 GPA would
be required for initiation.

The discussion centered on the
difference between the minimum
fraternity GPA and the 1.5 GPA es-
tablished by the university for aca-
demic probation.

Blacks to join faculty

 

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

There will be three black professors
among the new faculty members com-
ing to W&L next year.

Anne Wortham will be an assistant
professor of Sociology. After graduat-
ing from Tuskegee College she went
on to earn her Ph.D. at Boston Col-
lege. A former journalist, she wrote
for numerous publications, including
Esquire magazine, and also worked on
the Huntley-Brinkley report in 1967-
169.

Wortham was an assistant professor
at Wellesley College in 1982, then she
spent the following four years at the
Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University, where she was an
assistant professor of Public Policy.
She is currently a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution at Stanford
University, where she is developing a
book on intellectuals on policy mak-
ing.

‘‘She was our number one candi-
date,’’ stated Professor David No-
vack, when asked about the selection
of the right person to fill this position.
“Fortunately she felt positive about
us,”” he added.

fended the higher GPA. He said he
wanted to see the ‘fraternities lead the
way” in improving grades.

He said the requirement could be
used by fraternities to defend them-
selves against parents who feel their
son’s poor GPA is a result of too much
fraternity and not enough studying.

Several members of the audience
defended fraternities and said that
through study halls and motivation by
brothers fraternities do emphasize
academic performance as one of their
goals.

IFC President Mark Farley,

Wortham was selected out of ap
proximately 120-130 original appli
cants for the position, according to
Novack. The committee has been re
viewing applications since December

Joyce MacDonald will be on th
W&L English staff for the 1988-89
school year. MacDonald is currently
finishing work at Vanderbilt on het
Ph.D. in English Literature, with a
specialty in Shakespeare.

According to Dean John Elrod,
MacDonald will be working here as
an ‘ABD Fellow,’’ ABD standing for
** All But Dissertation.’’ People under
this program spend a major portion of
their time, aside from teaching, writ
ing their dissertation.

A third professor, Benjamin Dais,
will be at W&L during Winter Tern:
Dais will be a temporary faculty
member under the Visiting Black
Professor program.

With the exception of a black Ac
counting professor who taught in the
Commerce School a few years back
these will be the only black professors
to teach in the undergraduate division
of W&L. Of these three, Wortham is
the only professor to be signed on for
a tenure position; MacDonald and
Dais will have temporary positions.

however, countered by saying,
‘*fraternities do not always act re
sponsibly.”* He cited the ‘‘record
number of freshmen admitted
Stonewall Jackson Hospital in one
evening’’ during Rush as an example
of fraternity’s ‘‘responsibility.”*

At the end of the meeting an infor
mal poll was taken.

No one favored the first option and
the rest of the votes were divided
evenly between the second option and
“none of the above.”’

The IFC, however, voted unani
mously for the first option.

W&L debate team takes
Great Britain by storm

 

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

Rather than spend their February
break in Cancun, New Orleans, or
Colorado, sophomores Donald DeFa-
bio and Damon Fensterman travelled
to England to represent W&L in
several debates.

The two students sent several
resolutions to schools in England to
propose various debate topics. The
University of London, Southampton
University, Durham University, and
Leedes University replied that their
debate teams would accept the stu-
dents.

At the University of London and
Durham University, DeFabio and
Fensterman prepared to challenge the
resolution that America is a debau-
ched society. At both schools they op-
posed the statement and won.

At Southampton University they
supported the resolution that govern-
ment should be for the people, not by
the people. Though not victorious on
this resolution, the two thought they
had done well despite the loss.

The team prepared for the debates
by researching their topics, thinking
them over, and writing theoretical
speeches. They rely on bouncing ideas
around with each other as they pre-
pare; an allowance for spontaneity to
respond at the actual debate is also
part of debating.

The British style of debating is quite

different from the American. Au-
dience participation is allowed and en-
couraged; questions may be asked at
any point during the speeches, even by
the other team.

This style puts a greater emphasis
on one’s speaking abilities, rather than
focusing on one’s research abilities as
in the U.S. Speaking to an audience
who will decide the victor is quite
different from speaking to a judge.
The students prefer the British system
because they think it prepares one as a
better speaker, which is the ultimate
goal of debating.

The debate team at W&L has an
exchange program with British
schools every year. The teams alter-
nate with the W&L traveling one year,
the British team visiting America the
next.

DeFabio and Fensterman noted a
greater interest in debating among
British students compared to Ameri-
can students. After many of the de-
bates in England, the students would
get together over dinner or drinks and
continue discussions. Fensterman
thought they were less afraid to be in-
tellectually aggressive in challenging
each other on current issues than typi-
cal American students.

In retrospect both students thought
the trip was a great success and an im-
pressive experience. Not only debat-
ing at the several campuses but travell-
ing throughout England made the trip
an enjoyable way to spend February
Break.

 

AIDS

_) Continued from page 1

 

pic will be ‘Research Progress on
AIDS.”

All three speakers have been in-
volved in AIDS research, education,
and policy issues since the earliest
days of the disease’s identification and
have made presentations throughout

the country.

The Telford Lecture Series was es-
tablished through the generosity of
Robert Lee Telford of Naples, Fla., a
member of W&L’s class of 1922 and
the former chair of the board of
Mason and Hanger-Silas Mason Co.
Inc.

The program is designed to bring to
the W&L campus scholars of national
reputation, particularly those from the
fields of physical and life scicnces,
social sciences, business, and the hu-
manities.

After the first week of the season,
the W&L baseball team is at an even
.500. The Generals captured two wins
out of a three game series last week-
end against the NAIA West Virginia
Tech team on Smith Field. W&L then
lost to Bridgewater on the road in its
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
opener on Tuesday afternoon.

On Friday against West Virginia
Tech the team looked pretty sharp.
Senior Carter Steuart was the Gen-
eral’s starting pitcher, picking up the
win as junior Mike Temple came on in
relief and got the save. After the Gen-
erals posted a 6-1 lead, Tech made a
valiant comeback that just fell short as
W&L stayed on top for an 8-6 win.

Things were just as close between
the two teams on Saturday afternoon.
Senior Eric Acra started off the pitch-
ing this time with sophomore David
Smith and Temple coming in for re-
lief. The game wasn’t decided until
the final inning, but Tech pulled out a
9-8 victory. The Generals had two

men on and two outs in the bottom of
the seventh inning, but first-year law
student Hugh Finkelstein struck out to
end the game.

W&L then bounced back with jun-
ior Chris Cunningham on the mound
to get a 5-3 victory in the second game
of the doubleheader. Junior Dave Hol-
land got the save for the Generals.

The story was not as pleasant from
the Tuesday trip to Bridgewater. The
Generals lost a deceivingly close 7-0
game to the Eagle with Steuart on the
mound and Temple in for relief.

‘It was a really close game,”’ said
head coach Jeff Stickley.
‘‘{Bridgewater] got the hits all at one
time and we just didn’t. That was the
biggest difference.’’ Bridgewater
scored on two-run and three-run
homers. Outside of that, it was a very
solid game for the Generals defen-
sively.

Offensively, W&L was a little off
from its weekend production. ‘‘We
need to score more when we get the
chance,” said Stickley. Although the
lost opportunities did not help the
Generals on the scoreboard, they did
make the game a lot closer than the

Men’s tennis chalks up two more victories

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
tennis team continued its winning
ways this past week with victories
over two Division If Pennsylvania
schools, Slippery Rock State College
and Bloomsburg University. With the
two wins the Generals’ record climbs
to 4-2.

Last Thursday the Generals played
host to Slippery Rock State College,
coached by Jim McFarland. The Gen-
erals had no problem handling the
Rockets, winning 8-1.

In singles action, W&L’s No. 1
player, junior Robert Haley, beat
Mike Karijanian 6-1, _6-3.,The Gen-
erals’ No, 2 man, junior Bobby Matt-
hews, handled Johnathan Donado in
even finer fashion, 6-1, 6-0, and No.
3, senior David McLeod, blanked
Slippery Rock’s Scott Jackson 6-0,
6-0.

At No. 4, senior Chris Wiman ran
into trouble against the Rocket’s Jere
Woodyard, dropping the first set 3-6.

Wiman rallied in the second set,
however, forcing Woodyard into a tie-
breaker. After a fervent battle, Wiman
lost out on the sixth tie-breaker, giv-
ing Woodyard the match, 3-6, 7-6 (6).

W&L’s No. 5 man, freshman Bill
Meadows, had little trouble with his
opponent, Drew Dearborn, winning in
straight sets, 6-1, 6-1. Moving up to
the No. 6 position for the match
against Slippery Rock was sophomore
Matt Ormiston, who also blanked his
opponent, Bob Starr, 6-0, 6-0.

After a short break, the teams met
again in doubles competition, W&L
swept the pairs with the team of Matt-
hews/McLeod winning 6-1, 6-3 and
Haley/Meadows combining for a 6-2,
6-4 win. i.

Although it-appeared as if all three
doubles matches ‘were going
smoothly, the No. 3 tandem of Ormis-
ton and freshman Reid Manley ended
up having to battle hard for the win.
The pair won the first set convinc-
ingly, 6-0, but the Rockets managed
to rally to win the second set 6-1. Or-
miston and Manley settled down to

Lax defeats Hornets,
gives O-W tough test

The W&L lacrosse team is only
.500 overall, just as it was last week at
this time, but the Generals have come
a long way in two games, proving to
themselves and their fans that they can
compete with the best in Division III.

W&L scored eight goals in 17
minutes to tie the defending national
runners-up Saturday before losing to
Ohio Wesleyan in the final minutes.

Then, in case there were any
doubts, the Generals added an excla-
mation mark Wednesday by winning
their second Old Dominion Athletic
Conference game, defeating Lynch-
burg College 9-5 in a game W&L
dominated throughout.

True, a loss is a loss, whether the
score is 24-5 or 11-9, but W&L’s two-
point defeat Saturday wasn’t anything
like the beating the Generals suffered
in their only other loss this season.

In fact, if there is such a thing as a
positive loss, this was it.

For the second time in as many
games, the Generals started slowly,
this time allowing seven goals before
they even got off a shot. But W&L
stormed back with five straight goals
and went on to tie the game twice be-
fore the Battling Bishops were able to
nail down the win.

‘That game proves we can compete
with anyone in Division III,’’ said
head coach Dennis Daly. *‘We should
go into the rest of the season with a
certain amount of confidence, know-
ing we have what it takes to win.”

Bishop attackman Rob Alvino star-
ted the scoring less than two minutes
into the game, and the all-American
scored three more times before W&L
freshman midfielder Clark Wight put
the Generals on the scoreboard 11
minutes into the second quarter.

Wight’s first goal as a collegian
made the score 7-1 and started a major
swing in momentum. After an O-W
timeout, the Generals won the faceoff
and quickly set up a goal by senior
Robbie Stanton that cut the margin to
five.

Less than two minutes later, W&L
sophomore attacker Chris Giblin re-
corded his first goal of the day to
make the score 7-3 at halftime

The W&L swing continued in the
second half, as sophomore midfielder
Chris Mastrogiovanni scored on a
pass from Stanton two minutes into
the third quarter.

The Generals capped their five-goal
run with an extra-man goal by Stanton
four minutes later, making the score
7-5. O-W’s Charlie Blanchard broke
the W&L scoring streak at the eight-
minute mark to put the Bishops up by
three, but senior attacker Peter Smith
answered for the Generals less than
thirty seconds later.

A Mastrogiovanni goal with 5:50
left in the third quarter pulled W&L to
within one, and, three minutes later,
senior midfielder Sandy Harrison’s
first goal of the day tied the game for
the first time since it began.

In the final quarter, the Bishops re-
gained the lead on a goal by attacker
Dan Hannan, but the Generals re-tied
the score at nine when sophomore at-
tacker Patrick Gochar scored with five
minutes left.

The Bishops shut out the Generals
the rest of the way, however, scoring
twice during the final four minutes to
nail down their second victory of the
season.

In the Lynchburg game it was the
Generals who took the early lead, and
W&L coasted to a four-goal victory.

On an ice-cold afternoon, Smith and
junior John Ware combined for five
goals in the first half as W&L shut out
the Hornets in the first two periods.

The Generals were in command all
day long, taking more than twice as
many shots as the Hornets (47-20) and
controlling the ground balls (62-36).

Although the Hornets won the sec-
ond half 5-4, the W&L win was never
really in doubt.

The game was plagued by 17 penal-
ties. Surprisingly, W&L failed to
score on nine extra-man opportuni-
ties, while the Hornets recorded three
of their five goals on power plays.

‘*We won, but we won ugly,””
Daly.

Ware led all scorers with four goals,
and Smith scored three times. Harr-
ison, Giblin and Gochar each record-
ed one goal.

Looking ahead, W&L begins a
four-game home stand against Gettys-
burg at 2 p.m. Saturday and plays host
to Bowdoin College a week later

said

business in the third set and squelched
the Rockets 6-3.

On Friday the Generals faced
Bloomsburg University, coached by
Burton Reese. Bloomsburg, ranked
ninth nationally in the D-II polls, had
travelled to Lexington from Char-
lottesville. Bloomsburg had dropped a
close decision there to the University
of Virginia, 5-4, on Thursday. W&L
faced tough competition from
Bloomsburg, and the action was fierce
in the hot afternoon sun.

The two teams played doubles first,
and the Generals won two of the three
matches.

W&L’s McLeod and Matthews beat
Roly Lamy and Lance Milner in
straight sets, 6-3, 6-2. The combina-
tion of Wiman and sophomore John
Morris needed an’ éxtra ‘game to win
the first'‘set from Mark Billone and
Marc Lupinacci 7-5, and closed out
the match with a more convincing
second set, 6-2.

Haley and Meadows could not piece
together a win, however, against Matt
Quigley and Dave Gilbert. The
Bloomsburg pair took the match in

straight sets, 6-3, 6-2.

Going into the singles action, the
Generals knew it would be close, and
it was.

Haley dropped his match to Mark
Billone at No. | by a score of 5-7, 3-6.
“T played well, but I didn’t win the
big points,”’ said Haley, who remains
confident despite the loss. ‘‘I was
happy with the way I was hitting the
ball.”’

He went on to say that the tough
games being played now will allow
the Generals to be on top of their game
in May, when W&L hosts the NCAA
D-III Men’s Tennis Championships
for the second time in four years.

‘*These early matches are great for us
going into Division III Nationals.”’

Matthews, consistent to form, han-
dled Bloomsburg’s No. 2 player,
Lamy, quickly, winning 6-1, 6-1.
McLeod, playing again at No. 3 for
W&L, beat Milner 6-4, 6-4.

Back again in his No. 4 position for
the Generals, Morris had his work cut
out for him against Bloomsburg’s

Mare Ludinacci. Morris had to wait
until the sixth tie-breaker point in the
first set to win it 7-6 (6). Ludinacci at-
tempted to rally in the second set, but
Morris slammed the door, winning 6-
3.

At No. 5, Chris Wiman also had his
hands full early. Facing Matt Quigley,
Wiman came back after losing the first
set 5-7, to win the match 5-7, 6-1,
6-4. No. 6 Meadows also needed three
sets to beat Dave Gilbert 3-6, 6-3,
6-4. Final team score: Generals 6,
Bloomsburg 3.

The Generals continue to tune their
game for the Swarthmore/Washington
College matches on March 26 by play-
ing five teams this week.

W&L will play Millersville today at
3 p.m. and Virginia Tech on Saturday
at 2 p.m., both here in Lexington.
Sunday the Generals travel south to
North Carolina to play Davidson (1
p.m.) and return to Lexington to play
Lynchburg College on Monday (3
p.m.) and the University of North
Carolina at Greensboro on Tuesday,
again at 3 p.m.

Linksters dig hole in finishing 20th

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Last weekend’s James Madison In-
vitational tournament was not exactly
the way the W&L golf team wanted to
kick off its 1988 season.

The Generals dug themselves into a
hole on the first day, but regrouped on
the second day to finish in 20th place
out of 23 teams.

‘*We're not pleased with the way
we finished,’’ said head coach Buck
Leslie. ‘We did, however, play better
on the second day and beat three

teams.'’ The Generals were tied for
last place after the first round of play.

W&L was led by senior Gary
Campbell,
163. Junior Tom Wingfield shot a re-
spectable 170 in his first college tour-
nament. As a team, the Generals shot
337 the first day and 334 the second
for a total of 671. East Tennessee
State won the tournament with a score
of 590,

‘*We hit the ball pretty well,”’ said
Leslie. ‘‘It was one of those times
when you hit the ball well, but you
can’t score. And scoring is the name
of the game.”

with a two-day score of

The team especially had difficulty
on the two trouble holes on both the
front and back nine of the golf course.
One General suffered a 10 while a few
others scored 8. **We got hurt there,”’
said Leslie.

The Generals cancelled their trip to
Ashland, Va., to compete with other
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
teams in a round-robin tournament
W&L will travel to North Carolina to
compete in the two-day Elon tourna
ment on Monday and Tuesday

‘There should be some good com

to be a good test for us.”

Lynchburg

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

 

Despite extreme cold and high
winds, the W&L women’s tennis team
breezed by Old Dominion Athletic

Conference rival Lynchburg 7-2 at

home in its opening match of the
season.

Freshmen Jean Stroman and Kathy
Leake, ranked numbers one and three
in team singles respectively, finished
off their opponents in two sets—6-2,
6-2 and 6-4, 6-0. Numbers two and
four, freshman Kelly Martone and
junior Martha Christian won their
matches in the third set. Martone’s
score was 6-2, 3-6, 7- 5, and Chris-
tian’s ended in a tie-breaker 6-3, 7-6,
7-6.

W&L’s No. 5. singles player,
freshman Shawn Wert, lost 2-6, 6-2.
2-6. Junior Benny Savage, playing
No. 6, shut out her opponent 6-0, 6-0.
The Generals won two of the three
matches played in the doubles compe-
tition.

The team was missing its usual No.
4 singles player, sophomore Theresa
Southard, because of illness. This
caused the Generals to shuffle their
lineup a bit, moving Christian to four
and having Savage play at number six.

Head coach William Washburn had
no definite expectations, but he was
pleased with the outcome since
Lynchburg is an experienced and
senior-dominated team.

Today, W&L plays Southern Sem-
inary in an exhibition match at home
on the lower courts. The Generals’
next official matches are Friday
against Longwood and Monday
against Wellesley, both in Lexington.
The team travels to Bridgewater for an
ODAC match with the Eagles on
Tuesday before returning to take on
Roanoke on Wednesday.

From Staff Reports

 

W&L had three individual ath-
letes perform at NCAA champion-
ships last week.

The W&L women’s swim team
was represented by junior Eli-
zabeth Miles and freshman Sharon
Coleman at the NCAA champion-
ships held in Atlanta on March
10-12.

Miles broke the school and
ODAC record by finishing 18th in
the 1,650 yard freestyle in a time
of 18:08.06 (She had a school and
ODAC record during her
1,000-yard  split-10:55.69). She
also swam the 500-yard free (23rd,
5:17.09) and the 200-yard free
(24th, 2:00.39).

Coleman broke the school and
ODAC record in the 100-yard but-
terfly when she finished 29th with
a time of 1:01.46. She also swam
the 200-yard fly (20th, 2:14.27).

Although neither swimmer ear-
ned all-American honors nor
scored any team points, head coach
Page Remillard was proud of the
way both swimmers performed.
‘*They are happy with their swims,
but disappointed that they didn’t
score any team points. They are
committed to scoring those points
next year,”’ he said.

Sophomore pole vaulter Phillip
Sampson also competed in the
NCAA championships. He fin-
ished 8th at the NCAA Indoor
championships held at Smith Col-
lege in Northampton, Ma. when he
vaulted 14°6”’

World Jazz great
Marsalis plays Chapel

 

Irom Staff Reports

 

Renowned jazz pianist Ellis Marsa-
lis will perform with his trio on Wed-
nesday, March 23 at 8:00 p.m. at Lee
Chapel. There is no charge for W&L
undergraduate and law students, be-
cause of the substantial support from
the University to the Rockbridge Con-

ert- Theatre Series.

The name Marsalis is in the fore-
front of today’s music. Wynton and
Branford Marsalis are top recording
irtists and award winning musicians.
Younger brothers are in the wings.
But it all goes back to their father.

‘Ellis Marsalis, Jr. has a list of cre-
dentials no less remarkable than those
of his celebrated sons,’ according to
an extensive article in the Los Angeles
limes.

From his early days as pianist with
the Al Hirt Band to his present posi-
tion as Coordinator of Jazz Studies at
Virginia Commonwealth University,
Marsalis has studied, performed and
taught the diverse aspects of jazz. ‘‘l
was a jazz player from day one’, he
proudly claims.

Born in New Orleans, with exten-
sive piano and clarinet training, he
also studied the cello, recieved a
Bachelor of Arts degree in Music Ed-
ucation from Dillard University and
later a Masters degree of Music Edu-
cation from Loyola University.

Marsalis has led a double life as per-
former and teacher. He has performed
extensively in New Orleans, while
teaching high school and college mu-
sic courses and maintaining a stable

family life with his wife, Dolores, and
their six sons. Over the years, he has
performed nationally and internation-
ally and recorded a number of albums.

From 1974 to 1986, Marsalis was
an instrumental music instructor at the
well-known New Orleans Center for
the Creative Arts. It was there that the
new generation of jazz musicians were
developing. Wynton and Branford
Marsalis, as well as Terence Blan-
chard, Donald Harrison and Kent Jor-
dan, all regarded as ‘‘wunderkinder”’
or prodigies, were schooled by Ellis
Marsalis.

At the present time, Marsalis is a
Commonwealth Professor in the Mu-
sic Department at Virginia Common-
wealth University in Richmond,
where he states that, ‘‘I have found a
supportive administration in an envir-
onment that encourages experi-
mentation. With this opportunity I
hope to fulfill a long awaited dream of
helping to bring to the mainstream of
American education America’s only
contribution to world culture—Jazz.”’

Among his many affiliations, he is
also on the Academic Council of the
Thelonious Monk Center for Jazz
Studies in Washington, D.C., which
was founded and sponsored by the
Beethoven Society to help foster the
serious study of jazz.

Marsalis will perform at Lee Chapel
with reeds player Victor Goines, bas-
sist Delbert Felix and percussionist
Clarence Penn. The program will con-
tain some of Marsalis’ own composi-
tions as well as those of other com-
posers including Duke Ellington, The-
lonious Monk and Charlie Parker.

Accuracy is part of convention's history

 

By Jennifer Bandrowski
Staff Reporter

 

1988 is the year of W&L’s
19th Mock Convention, main-
taining .an eighty-year-old tra-
dition. The convention began in
1908 as a class project for a poli-
tics course taught by Assistant
Professor of Economics and
Politics W. Jett Lauck.

Students had been inspired a
few weeks before by William
Jennings Bryan's ‘‘Cross of
Gold’’ speech, ziven in Lexing-
ton. He was consequently cho-
sen as the Democratic nominee
by the first Mock Convention,
beginning the con/ention’s 80
year tradition of accuracy.

This first Mock Convention
was given nominal, second-page
coverage by The Ring-Tum Phi.
However, the The Lexington
Gazette ran an impressive front-
page story, praising those in-
volved.

*‘The young gentlemen en-
tered into the meeting with the
zest of seasoned politicians, plus
the enthusiasm of collegians.”’

Debates had become so heated
at the first convention between
supporters of Minnesota Gov-
ernor John A. Johnson and those
of Bryan that fist fights were
threatened and the members of
the Kansas delegation almost
withdrew from the activity.

In 1912, the convention expe-
rienced its first error. It nomi-
nated Judson Harmon rather
than Woodrow Wilson, who was
expected to be a dark horse.

In 1916, when Wilson ap-
peared to be the obvious Demo-
cratic nominee, W&L students
chose to hold a Mock Republi-
can Convention, thus beginning
the tradition of predicting the
outcome of the convention for
the party out of power in the
White House.

With the majority of W&L
students at this time being De-
mocrats, those involved with the
1916 Convention learned of the
need for intense research, which
was rewarded with the correct
prediction of Charles Evans
Hughes.

The 1916 convention began in
the new Doremus gymnasium
and then moved to Lee Chapel,
where the first two had been
held. From then on, all conven-
tions were held in Doremus.

Due to a low enrollment and
lack of interest following World
War I, no convention was held.
This was made up for, however,
with the exciting wet/dry debates
of the 1924 Convention.

Candidates were divided re-
gionally and by issues, leaving
delegates puzzled over a com-
promise candidate. They finally
decided on W&L alumnus John
W. Davis. Davis was a West
Virginia congressman, Solicitor-
General, and ambassador to
Great Britain.

That summer in New York
City, the real convention was
also marked by heated debate
over the 18th amendment and
sectionalist disagreement over
candidates. Following the pat-
tern of the W&L students, they

too selected Davis. The conven-
tion closed to the tune of the
““W&L Swing,’’ which became
Davis’ campaign song.

The Convention suffered some
hard times from 1936 through
1948, with three wrong predic-
tions and the absence of a con-
vention in 1944, due to the
aftermath of World War II.

Since then, however, it has
maintained its tradition of accur-
acy. The only incorrect predic-
tion made since World War II
was in 1972 when Edward M.
Kennedy was chosen rather than
George McGovern.

In 1952, Mock Convention
leaders learned the value of
maintaining contact with state
party leaders, a precedent estab-
lished by economics major Da-
vid Constine, who was state
chairman of California.

California Governor Earl
Warren, a dark horse candidate
who would head the California
delegation at the actual conven-
tion, was trailing Sen. Robert A.
Taft of Ohio and World War II
hero General Dwight D. Eisen-
hower after three ballots. War-
ren contacted Constine and told
him to free his delegates, who
swung to Eisenhower, giving
him the nomination and making
Warren his running mate.

The same convention was also
highlighted by prominent guest
speakers Harold Bratches, the
Chairman of the Republican
National Committee, and Sena-
tor Frank Carlson, Director of
the National Eisenhower Head-
quarters.

The Mock Convention
received national attention in the
face of tragedy in 1956. Senator
Alben Barkley of Kentucky, who

cod

had been Vice President under
Truman, was the keynote
speaker. Barkley mentioned dur-
ing his speech the Mock Conven-
tion had inspired him to plan on
attending the national conven-
tion that summer, though he had
not planned to previously. He
felt ‘‘like an old firehorse that
hears the bell.’’ Becoming more
and more emotional as he spoke,
Barkley exclaimed, ‘‘I would
rather be a servant in the house
of the Lord than to sit in the seats
of the mighty.”’ These would be
the Senator’s last words for he
collapsed suddenly of a heart at-
tack and fifteen minutes later
was pronounced dead.

With the encouragement of
Barkley’s widow, convention ac-
tivity was resumed a week later
to accurately nominate Adlai
Stevenson. At the next conven-
tion, Harry Truman himself
would be the keynote speaker.

Since then, the Convention
has continued its accuracy as
well as attracted much attention
to Lexington every four years.

Recent conventions have fea-
tured such large political figures
as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Car-
ter, and Barry Goldwater, and
the 1988 convention has already
been kicked off, of course, with
the speech of Jesse Jackson.

Parades in the 1950s often in-
cluded Miss America and other
beauty queens.

And of course there is the
press attention that the Mock
Convention has received. Time
magazine calls it the ‘‘boo-
mingest of quadrennial campus
mass ventures into political pre-
diction,’’ and Newsweek labels it
“the most realistic.’” Tom
Sherwood of The Washington

 

WA&L News Office

Postwrote in 1984, ‘‘Forget Ca-
lifornia on July 5. Never mind
who will win in New Jersey. The
Democrats will nominate Walter
F, Mondale...’’ when reporting
the result of that year’s Mock
Convention.

Young, Robb, Clinton
selected as speakers

 

By Rob McPherson
Staff Reporter

 

Mayor Andrew Young of At-
lanta will get things started at the
1988 Mock Democratic Conven-
tion when he addresses the con-
gregation as the event’s keynote
speaker.

Young will speak on the morn-
ing of March 25 and will deliver
his speech just prior to the
choosing of candidates, said Les-
ter Coe, co-chairman of the con-
vention.

Traditionally, the keynote ad-
dress at a political convention
has been used to open the cere-
monies, usually in a dynamic
fashion. Coe said Young was as-
ked to deliver the speech because
of his ability to entertain and his
recognizable name.

‘*He’s a very dynamic speaker
who doesn’t hold back very
much,”’ said Coe.

In addition to Young, five
other prominent Democrats will
speak during the two-day long,
three session convention.

At the first session, Gov. Ger-
ald Baliles and Lt. Gov. Douglas
Wilder will speak along with

Gerald Baliles

sixth district U.S. Rep. Jim
Olin.

At the second session, former
governor of Virginia Charles
Robb will deliver the opening
address and Bill Clinton, the
governor of Arkansas, will de-
liver the platform address. Both
Robb and Clinton are powerful
Democrats, according to Coe.
He said Clinton is presently one
of the party’s top two choices for
vice-president.

Young’s speech and the choos-
ing of the candidates will make
up the third session.

Coe said the convention staff
had been working to get Sen.
Albert Gore of Tennessee as a
speaker and almost had him
scheduled for March 4.
However, according to Coe,
time limitations and Fancy Dress
caused scheduling problems.

‘*We had somewhat of an op-
portunity to get [Gore],’’ he
said, ‘‘but there were too many
things to be taken care of in too
short a period of time.”’

Coe said the Mock Conven-
tion is generally a respected
name and when someone from

the Mock Convention calls a
speaker, the speaker usually has
at least heard of the event.

‘*We have a lot of strong sell-
ing points,’’ Coe said.

“It seems that when we’re in
touch with someone they take a
long, hard look at us, even if
they have something sched-
uled,’” he added.

Coe said W&L’s location
sometimes presents a problem
because speakers can’t fly direc-
tly into Lexington.

**Sometimes, a speaker just
doesn’t have time to fly to Roan-
oke, drive 40 minutes, speak,
and drive back another 40
minutes,”’ he said.

According to Coe, the conven-
tion staff considered several
prominent Democrats in trying
to get speakers.

**Any big name you can think
of, we looked into it,’” he said.

“*You tend to pursue where
you think you have contacts.”’

The Mock Convention will
take place March 24 and 25. The
first and second sessions will be-
gin at 1:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.
respectively on the 24th. The
third session will begin at 9:30
a.m. on the 25th.

Conner: persistence is main research technique

 

By Wendy Wolford
Staff Reporter

 

One of the major tasks of the
Mock Convention Committee
involves researching the indivi-
dual states and the candidates in
order to successfully predict the
1988 Democratic presidential
nominee. According to Sam
Conner, chairman of the creden-
tials committee and coordinator
of the Upper South region, the
main research tactic is per-
sistence.

The long process begins with
each state chairman who must
develop contacts within his state,
keep up with the media and
gather enough information to

discover what kind of people live
in his area and which candidates
they are likely to support. The
Democratic party chairmen on
the state and national level usua-
lly provide a good starting point.

Contacts extend to reporters,
elected officials, political con-
sultants, and academics as well.
Porter Davis, regional coor-
dinator of the Midwest, finds
that ‘‘the state chairmen need to
establish a rapport with political
writers as well as the Democra-
tic national chairpersons. ”’

In interviewing national and
state organizations and contacts,
the researchers have an agenda
of issues to inquire about from
domestic to foreign affairs.
Their findings focus mainly on

demographic data, past voting
records, the media, and election
polls.

This year the work of the
committee has been assisted by
the Presidential Campaign Hot-
line. This computerized informa-
tion search provides a daily syn-
opsis of newspaper and maga-
zine articles as well as television

broadcasts by each state. Conner
believes this is an advantage to

the committee because ‘‘it saves
time and money by not having to
subscribe to the individual pub-
lications.”’

The next step in the research
process involves the efforts of
the regional coordinators. Ac-
cording to Rob Ryan, the

Eastern regional coordinator, his

‘primary responsibility is keep-
ing up with the state chairmen
and analyzing their research.”’
The five regional coordinators
correlate the information on the
states in their areas to determine
the more popular candidates.

Together, the state chairmen,
political directors and the five
regional coordinators put forth
an effort to determine which
candidate each state will support
after the research is complete.
Recent polls and primaries held
before the Mock Convention are
helpful in determining which
candidates to support as well.

Because the Mock Convention
is being held earlier this year,

some of the states’ primaries will

not be held until after the event is
over. Conner concluded, ‘‘be-
cause the primary season is
much hotter than in the past, the
convention takes more of an ed-
ucational and predictive effort.’’
There is also the added responsi-
bility of guaranteed confidentia-
lity when dealing with sources.

As the convention draws near,
the work of the committee inten-
Sifies. Persistence in gathering
research is indeed necessary.
Now that their jobs in research
are almost complete, the com-
mittee hopes to fulfill their main
objective which according to
Rob Ryan is ‘‘promoting authen-
ticity in choosing the right can-
didate.”’

Students work to put together a float.

Big floats, little floats, horse-
drawn floats and cars. This is the
Mock Convention state parade.

On Thursday, March 24 most
state delegations will begin
building their floats. Some states
may begin earlier, but the
majority of the states will begin
at 9:30 a.m. on Lexington High
School’s Brewbaker Field. All
floats must be on the field by 3
p.m. The parade begins at 10
a.m. on Friday and is scheduled
to last about two hours.

According to Mock Conven-
tion Parade Chairman Frank
Kannapel, the parade will begin
at Lexington High School on
Wallace Street, turn right on
Main Street, left on Washington
Street and end at Warner Center.
State congressman Jim Olin will
be the Parade Marshall.

The judges reviewing stand is
scheduled to be on the corner of
Main and Nelson streets. Kan-
napel said that there will be three
float judges and three band
judges.

The float judges will be from
the W&L Art Department and
the band judges will be from the
Music Department. Floats will
be judged on appearance and
will receive cash prizes.

First prize is $100; second,
$75; and third, $50. Bands will
be judged on marching ability
and music. The first three places
in each category will receive
trophies.

Kannapel said most of the area
high schools and middle school
bands will be participating in the
parade as well as the W&L
ROTC Color Guard. Lexington

_ nom ‘

Fire Department, the Liberty
Hall Volunteers and the Palme-
tto Sharp Shooters, a group of
Civil War re-enactment soldiers,
will also march down the parade
route.

Several of the larger states
have sent out material and held
phone-a-thons soliciting funds
for their state expenses. Both
California and Colorado have
sponsors that will help support
their Mock Convention endea-
vors. Kannapel said Coors is
sponsoring Colorado and a Cali-
fornia raisin company is spon-
soring California.

Most state delegations solicit
money from family and friends
of delegates and alumni in its
state. Smaller states and states
with few alumni might not able
to be as elaborate in their float
decorations due to lack of funds.

Such is the case with Puerto
Rico. Puerto Rico Float Chair-
man Anne Large said that the
delegation did not have much
money because there was only
one alumnus there. However,
she said that regardless of lack of
funds, the delegates were ‘‘hav-
ing fun and were putting a lot of
effort into it.’’ Large said the
theme would be something tro-
pical.

Another small delegation,
American Samoa, will share a
float with Guam and the U.S.
Virgin Islands, according to its
chairman, George Nomikos.

Iowa state chairman Bill Mad-
dox said Iowa will most likely
have some sort of farm oriented
theme. Maddox said he is hoping
to have four riders on horseback
from Hollins College. He said
each horse will have a plaque
with a letter spelling out Iowa.
Maddox said it was doubtful, but
he hoped his delegation could
get Miss Iowa 1987 to partici-
pate in the parade.

Several other states have been
very secretive about their float
ideas. New Jersey state chair
man Tom Eterogino said, ‘‘It’s a
secret, but you'll understand
why when you see it.’” New Jer-
sey’s float idea is so secretive
that Eterogino said only a selec-
ted few people in the delegation
knew what was to be done on the
float. We anxiously await New
Jersey’s float.

New York was also reluctant
to give away it’s float theme.
Chairman Don Thayer echoed
Eterogino saying “‘It’s a se-
cret.””

Wisconsin state chairman
Laurel Mattson said that since
Wisconsin’s two main industries
are beer and cheese, the float
would be centered around that
theme. Mattson said the dele-
gation has planned out the float
and hopes to complete some of
the work on it the weekend be-
fore the parade.

According to Indiana Float
Chairman Chris Coffland, the
delegation’s float is finished.
Coffland said, ‘“We just thought
of things that reminded us of In-
diana and centered our theme
around those ideas. We spent
$20.’ Laughing, Coffland ad-
ded, ‘‘Our grades might have
suffered, but...””

Elaborating on the dele-
gation’s float, Indiana delegate
Sam Obershain said, ‘‘There
will be one celebrity on the float
and various members of the stu-
dent body. We tried to get David
Letterman, but he called and
said he couldn’t make it.”’

Coffland said the delegation
hopes to raise some money today
with a kissing booth in the ODK
Circle. He added, **We’re look-
ing for Sam to bring in about
$1000.’’ Good luck Indiana.

Bourbon, buttons
are among
MC memorabilia

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

One of the biggest elements
involved in the Mock Conven-
tion is the financing. In addition
to telethons, alumni contribu-
tions, and individual state fund
raising, the selling of memorabi-
lia and concessions is a key to fi-
nancing this important political
event. This year, as in years
past, t-shirts, skimmer hats, Jim
Beam, posters, grain cups, and
buttons will be sold.

The T-shirts feature a design
by graphic artist Susan Behm
from Atlanta. The graphics in-
clude a keg in the back of a
BMW with two donkeys driving
past the capital and heading
towards Lexington. The designs
on the T-shirt pockets as well as
on the grain cups belong to
W&L senior Glen Smith. Smith
had included the acronym
LCWB in his original design be-
cause according to memorabilia
chairman Todd Barton, ‘‘This is
the last convention with an all
male class. We put it in as a
small statement, and we were
forced to remove it.””

Apparently, Valerie Pierson,
secretary of Mock Convention,
was offended by the acronym
and had it removed. The artist
and Barton were outraged.

Another popular item on sale
during Convention time is the
specially labeled Mock Conven-
tion Jim Beam. This bourbon
can only be purchased at the Va.

ABC Store located in Lexington.
Barton encountered a little diffi-
culty engineering the special or-
der of Beam, but through the
help of the ABC office in Rich-
mond, Barton ordered 100 cases
or 1200 of the special bottles.
Barton says that the Beam which
sells for 50-cents cheaper than
regular Jim Beam “‘is selling
fast.”

Barton hopes revenue from the
memorabilia and concession
sales will bring in between 5,000
and 10,000 dollars. The memor-
abilia will be on sale in the Uni-
versity Center on March 21 and
22 as well as on the 500-level of
the gym during the Convention.

Hot dogs, Pepsi, which is a
special sponsor of the event,
chips, and candy will be avail-
able in the concessions booth.
Packages of Convention memor-
abilia will be sold at reduced
rates.

The memorabilia is good qua-
lity, according to Barton. He
purchased the T-shirts from
Southeast Silk Screeners in Ath-
ens, Ga, the posters through
Anne Coulling in the W&L print
shop and Hickory Oaks Printing,
the grain cups from Louisiana
Plastics of St. Louis, the buttons
from Voters Unlimited in New
York, and the hats from Brown
and Bigelow.

Barton encourages students to
purchase Mock Convention
items because he says, ““There is
only one Mock Convention for
every W&L student and it will
be well worth remembering. ”’

International press to cover convention

By Abb Jones
Staff Reporter

 

Journalists from Egypt,
France, Japan, Lebanon, Qatar
and Saudi Arabia are among the
reporters currently scheduled to
cover the 1988 Mock Democra-
tic Convention.

According to Tim Bolling,
media chairman for the conven-
tion, the foreign journalists will
be covering the Mock Conven-
tion while attending a seminar at
W&L designed to help them gain
insight into the American Presi-
dential electorate process.

The seminar, titled ‘The Race
of 88°’, is being co- sponsored
by the Foreign Press Center of
the United States Information
Agency, the W&L Journalism
Department and the 1988 Mock
Democratic Convention.
Speakers will include Betty Cole
Dukert, producer of NBC’s
**Meet the Press’’, Ken Tomlin-
son, senior editor of ‘‘Reader’s
Digest’’>, W&L Journalism
Professor and Pulitzer prize
winner Clark Mollenhoff and
William Anderson of the USIA.

Bolling, a senior from Hun-
tington, W.Va., has been work-
ing since last year to raise inter-
est among the state and national

‘media regarding the convention.

**What we've done is gotten
together a mailing list of all the
newspapers in the state, all the

 

Jams

newspapers with daily bureaus
in Washington, the three major
networks, CNN and C-SPAN
and all the major news maga-
zines—Newsweek, Time and
U.S. News & World Report,”’
said Bolling.

Bolling said covering the
Mock Convention should be a
learning experience for the for-
eign journalists, since the con-
vention fairly accurately depicts
the actual convention, which the
journalists will be covering this
summer.

“‘The idea behind this is to
give foreign journalists who
aren’t used to getting outside of
the D.C. area a chance to expe-
rience first-hand what an actual
convention is like,’’ he said.

Last May, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson’s speech on the W&L
campus was the first major
media event involving the con-
vention. Bolling said the event
was covered by NBC Nightly
News and USA Today.

The news media, which is ex-
pected to be a group of 30 to 40
reporters, cameramen and other
assistants, will set up in the
wrestling room the Warner
Center—the site of the conven-
tion, said Bolling. During the
convention, the room will be
transformed into the press
center, stocked with phone lines
and podiums for press conferen-
ces.

 

The journalists covering the
convention will include repor-
ters from the Associated Press
and United Press International
news wire services, Westingh-
ouse Newsfeed, a national news
service which provides telev-
ision broadcast stories for the
nation’s TV stations, several
national and state TV and radio
stations and newspapers, The
Ring-tum Phi and WLUR, which

will present live gavel-to-gavel
coverage of the convention, be-
ginning with the 10 a.m. parade
Friday, March 25.

Bolling also said the conven-
tion’s final results will be sent to
several political research pub-

lications for possible future
scholarly research and pub-
lication.

Scheduled speakers for the
convention include Atlanta

Mayor and former U.S. rep-
resentative to the U.N., Andrew
Young, Virginia Gov. Gerald
Baliles, former Gov. Chuck
Robb and Arkansas Gov. Wil-
liam Clinton.

Bolling said that as the con-
vention receives final commit-
ment from remaining possible
speakers more journalists will
plan on arriving in Lexington to
cover the convention.

First rule of being a delegate
is to enjoy the convention

 

By Andy Nixon
Staff Reporter

 

With the W&L Mock Conven-
tion rapidly approaching, the
time has arrived to mobilize the
vast amount of delegates who
will crowd the floor of the con-
vention.

The first rule of participating
as a delegate, as said by the state
chairman Eugene Stephens of
North Carolina, is ‘‘to sit back
and enjoy, because most of the
work is already done.’’ The fact
is that the money has been raised
by the state committees, contacts
have been made, and the phone-

a-thons are over.

There are, however, certain
things that delegates can be do-
ing to increase their involvement
in the convention. The most ob-
vious thing is to simply be
aware, With all the candidates
and primaries that have occurred
within the past few months, a
knowledge of the candidates, is-
sues, and state’s opinion would
help. As chairman of New York,
Jim Sloat, stated, ‘‘the delegates
should know how the delegates
fit into the bigger picture.”’

A second function delegates
participate in is the building of
state floats for the convention
parade. States have spent a great

deal of time raising money, part
of which is designated for the
construction of floats. State
delegation will also have parties
during the weekend of the con-
vention which, of course, dele-
gates are encouraged to attend.
State delegation meetings will
be held in the near future in or-
der to coordinate all the final
preparations for the convention.
And while little knowledge is
needed for float building or at-
tending parties, knowledge of
the candidates and the current
status of the 1988 campaign cer-
tainly will help the chances of
W&L holding yet another suc-
cessful Mock Convention.

Journalists to attend seminar

 

From Staff Reports

 

W&L will host a seminar for
foreign journalists on the 1988
presidential election campaign
March 24 at 3 p.m. in Northen
Auditorium.

The seminar, entitled ‘‘The
Race of '88’’, is sponsored by
the Foreign Press Center of the
United States Information
Agency, the W&L Department
of Journalism and Communica-
tions, and the 1988 Mock De-
mocratic Convention.

Panelists include Ken Tomlin-
son, senior editor of Reader's
Digest; Betty Cole Bukert, pro-
ducer of NBC News’ long-
running Meet the Press; Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist Clark
R. Mollenhoff, of the W&L
Journalism Department; and
several W&L journalism stu-
dents. The panel moderator will
be William F. Anderson, of the
USIA Foreign Press Center.

Prof. John K. Jennings,
Chairman of the W&L Journal-
ism Department, said that the
event represented a very positive
joint effort between the USIA
and W&L.

‘*We are very pleased to work
with the United States Informa-
tion Agency in setting up a sym-
posium for foreign journa-
lists,’’ said Jennings. “‘It is, in-
deed, a fortunate bit of timing
that the symposium takes place
on the eve of the 1988 Mock
Democratic Convention. ”’

The Mock Democratic Con-
vention gets underway the fol-
lowing day, Friday, March 25,
in the Warner Center on the
W&L campus.

The seminar was set up to al-
low foreign journalists to gain
insight into the many compli-
cated factors that go into the
election of a U.S. president. As
many, W&L is perhaps uniquely
qualified to host such an event,
said Tim A. Bolling, a senior,
and Media Chairman of the
Mock Convention.

“‘W&L has the twin benefits
of having the oldest school of
journalism in the country, and
the Mock Convention, which is
an unsurpassed predictor of
presidential politics.’’, said Boll-
ing. ‘‘But we also take pride in
the level of authenticity at the

Mock Convention. We accurate-
ly duplicate all aspects of a real
nominating convention.”’

This level of realism makes
organizers confident that they
will be able to offer such unique
insights into the factors that will
determine the future leadership
of the U.S.

“‘The convention should give
the foreign journalists a good
preview of the real thing to take
place this summer in Atlanta."’,
said Jennings.

News organizations already
scheduled to participate in the
seminar include the Voice of
America, which is broadcast
throughout the world, one of the
largest TV networks in Japan,
and leading news organizations
from France, Saudi Arabia, Qa-
tar, Lebanon, and Egypt.

The financial organization of
the 1988 Mock Democratic
Convention has successfully
reached its fund raising goals.
Preparation and organization
have eliminated problems in the
areas of fund raising and funding
the convention. Spending has
been frugal in previous months
to insure a good position at the
time of the convention, says
Treasurer Brad Watkins.

The committee used innova-
tive measures to raise money and
has exceeded the 1984 conven-
tion by more than $2,000, even
though this year’s falls earlier in
the school calender.

The budget, roughly
$136,000, comes from a vast
number of sources and finances
every aspect of the convention.
The Executive Committee de-
signated $25,000 to the conven-
tion from its budget of the Stu-
dent Activities Fees.

The Hatton W. Sumners
Foundation of Dallas, Texas
contributes to the convention
every four years by donating the
interest drawn off its principle;
this year it yielded $32,000.

Through organized mailings
and a phone-a-thon, approxi-
mately $45,000 has been raised.

Funds came primarily from
alumni, parents, and businesses.
The timing of the convention’s
fund raising was carefully
spaced with those of the de-
velopment office in order to
maintain good donor relations
for the university.

T-shirt and memorabilia sales
raise roughly $15,000. Adver-

tisements in the journal draw
$4,000. The convention relies
on each of the states to share a
large responsibility of the fund
raising.

Each state must raise a mini-
mum of funds that is designated
by the treasurer according to the
state’s size and number of dele-
gates. Each state chairman
received listings of parents and
alumni living in their state. The
states raise money to cover their
own expenses such as float con-
struction and political research;
the states also give to the trea-
sury of the general convention.

The steering committee esti-
mated the various expenses of
the convention and organized a
budget accordingly. Guest
speakers and the expenses of fa-
cilities, operations, and security
consume a large portion of the
funds. Committee operations
and political research also make
demands on the budget.

This year the Mock Conven-
tion office uses one of the uni-
versity’s IBM computers and a
Hewlett Packard Laser Printer at
the cost of one year’s deprecia-
tion.

Finance Chairman, Jim Met-
calfe designed a computer ac-
counting program for the
finances of the individual states
and the general convention. It al-
lows the finance committee to
make daily updates of the dona-
tions recieved. The committee
has also compiled a mailing list
of donors to help the next con-
vention.

The treasury finances the pub-
lication of the Mock Convention
Report as well as the correspon-
dence with the media and the
community.

AIDS symposium
stresses education

By Becky Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

The president of the American
Foundation for AIDS research said
Saturday that more care, research and
education are needed to deal with the
AIDS crisis.

In a lecture in Lee Chapel Dr. Mer-
vyn Silverman, who is a 1960 gra-

duate of W&L,, said there are two as- _

pects of the AIDS crisis—the disease
itself and society’s reaction to it. He
said the reaction includes four phases:
denial, anxiety, blame, and hysteria.

Silverman, who was the director of
public health for the city of San Fran-
cisco when the AIDS epidemic broke
out, said a national policy on AIDS is
desperately needed.

People need to show care and con-
cern for AIDS and its victims, not hys-
teria and barbaric practices, he said.

Silverman talked about cases of
AIDS where victims were physically
and mentally threatened and abused.
Silverman told this story: ‘‘A man in
New York with AIDS was beaten by
neighbors. When he asked his assai-
lants why, they said they were killing
AIDS.”

Silverman’s speech was part of a
weekend AIDS symposium sponsored
by the Telford Lecture series. John S.
Knox, associate professor of Biology
at W&L, said the topic of AIDS was

chosen because of the importance of
the subject.

Knox said that after a symposium on
AIDS last year at W&L, he found that
many students still did not realize the
critical importance of AIDS. ‘Several
students dismissed the subject as not
pertinent to them. They did not under-
stand the magnitude of the problem,”’
he said.

The program also included a lecture

by Harvard Medical School AIDS.

researcher Dr. Robert T. Schooley.
His lecture included a slide presen-
tation on the scientific research being
done on AIDS.

Schooley said, although research is
being done on a vaccine for the AIDS
virus, it does not look likely that on
will ever be found.

Schooley also said there will proba-
bly never be a cure for AIDS because
once you are infected, it becomes
fixed in your genes. He said the
research being done is mostly looking
for a way to keep AIDS victims alive.

He added that AIDS research is
helping to teach a lot about other
diseases, such as cancer.

At the symposium, questions were
written on the back of programs and
read to the speaker by Professor of
Chemistry James K. Shillington, who
introduced the speakers.

Knox said this change was made be-
cause last year there were so few ques-
tions. He said with a topic like AIDS

W&L conducts self-study
as part of re-accreditation

 

By Heidi Read
Staff Reporter

 

Budget, curriculum, facilities,
equipment and minority and women
representation. These factors and oth-
ers will be considered in W&L’s self-
study, a part of the re-accreditation
process.

According to John W. Elrod, dean
of the College, every ten years the
university must evaluate itself to get
re-accredited by the Southern Associa-
tion of Colleges and Schools.

The Commission on Colleges ac-
credits all institutions of higher edu-
cation.

Elrod said membership in the asso-
ciation is voluntary, but most colleges
and universities join.

‘‘Accreditation gives the university
credibility; parents know that their
children are attending universities that
have had their programs closely scru-

 

Mervyn F. Silverman

many people are intimidated but also
have a lot of questions. ‘“The response
from the audience on Saturday was
really good,’’ Knox said.

Questions varied greatly ranging
form what the media’s role in the
AIDS crisis should be to how much
competition there is between AIDS
researchers.

Dr. Richard Keeling, the director of

student health at the University of
Virginia, was scheduled to speak on
Friday night but cancelled because he
was ill.

There was moderate turnout for
Saturday’s lectures. Knox said he
would have liked to have seen more
people there, but the cancellation of
the keynote address was probably a
problem.

University and city to

enforce parking laws

 

By Jon Ryan
Staff Reporter

 

The university and the city will be
cracking down on parking next year,
said junior class Executive Committee
Representative John McDonough.

Also, the 1988 Mock Democratic
Convention and the Liberty Hall Vol-
unteers gave budget reports to the EC.

The university plans to try new
measures to compel freshmen to keep
their cars off Washington Street in
front of the dorms and Evans Dining
Hall.

According to Frank Parsons, execu-
tive assistant to the president, the city
has also announced that it will put
2-hour spots in the area and begin
ticketing and towing offenders.

This news came as part of a report
from the Parking Committee the EC
formed several weeks ago to study the
problem of Washington Street park
ing.

No plans to change the corral are in
progress, according to Parsons.

Parsons said the most likely pros-
pect for parking relief will be to get
spots from VMI

He said VMI is planning to build a
museum and theatre, which would
necessitate a change in their parking.

Parsons said that by VMI’s own es
timates there will be a few dozen addi
tional spots

He said that W&L is willing to give
up parking on Letcher Avenue, a sore
point at VMI, in exchange for 32 re-
served spots in the nearby VMI park-
ing lot.

The Mock Convention is on budget
and doing fine, according to Co-
Chairmen Lester Coe and George
Gist.

The two reported the number of
delegates needed has been cut to ap-
proximately 200, which they said they
considered good.

They also said that the EC should
start considering an interim chairman
for next year.

The interim chairman is responsible
for producing the final report, and
keeping the records from Mock Con-
vention intact.

The Liberty Hall Volunteers have
exhausted their EC allocation and are
seeking more funds.

Members of the group fund many
things out of their own pockets, ac-
cording to representatives from the
group.

The cost of guns in prohibitive,
however, and the group is trying to
build up a stock for use in re-
enactments.

They asked the EC to cover the cost
of another field piece and another tent.

Uniforms, they said, are easily bor-
rowed from VMI and other re-
enactment groups, but guns are lent
more reluctantly

tinized. W&L has been accredited for
hundreds of years,’’ Elrod said.

To become accredited, an institu-
tion must do a self-study in which fa-
culty, students and administrators par-
ticipate.

The study examines all aspects of
the university from the building and
grounds department to the president.

After the self-study is completed a
visiting team appointed by the execu-
tive director of the association comes
to examine the university’s self-study.
They make recommendations to the
Commission on Colleges on the uni-
versity’s re- accreditation.

Some requirements for re-
accreditation include having a certain
percentage of professors with terminal
degrees, (i.e. Ph.D., LL.D.), operat-
ing within the budget, conducting
searches for faculty, admissions re-
quirements, a mission statement that is
carried out by the university and goals
that are stated and met.

According to Elrod, four other de
partments within the university can be
accredited by associations other than
the one that accredits the university as
a whole. The four are: a special sec-
tion of the Chemistry Department, the
Journalism Department, the Law
school and the Commerce school. The
Journalism Department is up for re
accreditation this year.

According to Professor of Journal-
ism Ronald H. MacDonald, the Jour-
nalism Department is re-accredited
every six years. MacDonald said the
journalism department was organized
in 1925 and was in the first group of
schools accredited in 1945.

MacDonald said the departmental
accreditation process is very similar to
that of the university.

brary, the student-teacher ratio and
student job success when they are

Career center has
placed 25 seniors

 

By Stacy Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

Approximately 25 seniors have ac-
cepted jobs through interviews held by
the Career Development and Place-
ment Office this year, said Rick Heat-
ley, director of Career Services.

Senior Jim Cockey, of Scituate,
Mass., accepted a job offer with Sov-
tan Bank of Roanoke, he'said"Cockey
will be starting as a management asso-
ciate for Sovran.

‘‘The Placement Office was hugely
helpful,’’ said Cockey. ‘‘Especially
Mrs. Henneman,’’ he added. Cockey
was called back for second interviews
with five companies out of five inter-
views.

‘This senior class has used the ser-
vices very well,’’ said Heatley. 183 of
approximately 200 seniors registered
with the Placement Office, said Heat-
ley.

Senior Mike Hassinger, of Atlanta,
Ga., plans to go to law school next
year. He said he did not use the
Placement Office because he ‘‘didn’t
need to.’’ Senior Tom Langheim, of
Salem, Va., agrees. ‘‘I used the office
for some information,’ said Langh-
eim, who is planning to go to graduate
school.

“I am very pleased with those
seniors who used the services,’’ said
Heatley, ‘‘Most have used not only
training services, but also on-campus
recruitment.’’

This year between 55 to 60 com-
panies have come to W&L for on-
campus recruitment, approximately
20 companies more than last year,
said Heatley.

This growth can be attributed to
several changes in the Placement Of-
fice, said Heatley.

‘*We are assisted in part by alumni
volunteer operations,’’ he said. In
these programs alumni are given the
opportunity to participate in place-
ment. Alumni in banking, accounting
and insurance have come back to
campus to recruit, said Heatley.

Also, a Career Day that is held in
Lynchburg has an ‘impressive di-
versity of options,’’ said Heatley.
Only 20 students attended this year.
Heatley would like to see ‘‘no less
than 150 seniors attend next year.’

‘It’s hard to get a company to come
here,’’ said Heatley. This is largely
due to the size and location of W&L.
However, Heatley said that ‘good
press’’ is attracting more and more
companies.

Standard and Poor, a noted organi-
zation that reviews businesses and
corporations, recently conducted a
survey tracing the education of the
country’s top 50,000 executives (as
labelled by Fortune 500). W&L was
fourth, with 169 executives, behind
Williams College, Amherst and Col-
gate, with 355, 263, and 198 execu-
tives, respectively.

‘*Publicity like that attracts human
resources departments, which decides
what colleges to visit,’’ said Heatley.
This publicity increases the number of
businesses that come on-campus to
interview.

Between 40 to SO seniors have
received offers, said Heatley, and are
‘‘oscillating between the options.”

Senior Joe Zamorano, of Baltimore.
Md., has been interviewing since Sep-
tember. Said Zamorano of the Place-
ment Program, ‘‘They have so many
interviews on-campus. It saves a lot of
time because you don’t have to go off
campus.”’ Zamorano, a_ natural
science/math major, has had 13 inter
views including interviews with
pharmaceutical sales, retail com-
panies, and accounting firms. He has
been called back for a couple of sec-
ond interviews, although he has not
had any offers yet.

Heatley said there are two peaks in
interviewing. Accounting firms,
banks and corporations do most of
their recruiting in October and
November. There is another inter-
viewing peak in January and Febru-
ary, said Heatley, although the
Placement Office learns of people
coming to campus weekly.

“If anyone is out there innocently
thinking ‘I'll start my job search this
summer,’ I strongly urge him to come
in right away,’’ said Heatley. Most
corporations will have organized a
search early in the year in an attempt
to hire the best candidates, said Heat-
ley. He added that ‘‘doors close”
when the summer starts and it be-
comes much more difficult to conduct
a job search.

Senior Greg Knapp, of West Palm
Beach, Fla., said ‘‘I think [the Place-
ment Office] is good if you like bank-
ing. I don’t think I want commercial
banking.’’ He feels that the on-
campus recruiting is convenient,
however. ‘‘I haven’t had time to go
off-campus,’’said Knapp.

Knapp, who has been interviewing
since January, has been called back
for second interviews, as well. ‘‘Mrs.
Henneman was very helpful to me.
She gave me a lot of advice for second
interviews and would remind me of
things I needed to do,”’ said Knapp.

Senior Coalter Pollack, of Virginia
Beach, Va., said, ‘‘Mrs. Henneman is
very positive, very willing to help
you. She instills a positive attitude in
the student about himself, and that’s
important.’’ Pollack is an English
major who is looking for placement in
entry level sales and management.

Knapp’s only reservation with the
Placement Office is ‘‘there’s not too
much counseling going on, and I think
they need more of that,’’ he said.

Senior Rob Jones, of Newport
News, Va., said, ‘‘There wasn’t too
much [Heatley] could do, because |
didn’t know what I wanted to do.’

Jones attended the resume work-
shop, and has his resume on file in the
Placement Office. He said the resume
workshop was really helpful to him
Jones said, ‘‘I’m going to wait until
after I graduate to continue my job
search.”’

Heatley's goal is to actively involve
a larger part of each senior class in the
Career Development and Placement
Office.

‘‘Around here we are a much more
visible office and are involved in all
the campus activities,’’ said Heatley.

Zamorano said he paid attention to
the notices on campus and approved of
the offices sending information to the
fraternity house. Generally, he has

OPINION

 

Poster

The Mock Convention is finally here, after the long wait and
hours of work devoted to preparing the gigantic event. Of course,
those responsible for planning the convention and ensuring its suc-
cess deserve a round of applause, so to speak, for their efforts. It’s a
mammoth job, but one that is well worth the effort.

However, when we look at the memorabilia for the convention,
we think there is a problem. This problem is not nearly big enough
to cast a shadow of ill repute upon the convention, or truly diminish
the outstanding work that has been done so far. Still, it is a problem
that must be addressed.

The 1988 Mock Convention poster features two donkeys driving
a BMW. Of course, we have no problem with this; in fact, it seems
to be quintessential W&L. Unfortunately, in the back seat of the car
there is a tapped keg.

This may seem insignificant at first, until other recent events at
WA&L are considered. For example, when Trident put up posters for
its Winter Slosh party, there was an immediate uproar over the fact
that is featured a jeep with a keg in the back. The poster was quickly
taken down and changed to delete the keg.

Fraternities, which are not allowed to put up posters for parties
anymore, are not allowed to have party themes that stress alcohol.
Because of the drinking age fraternities are now being forced to
move to closed parties, and will most likely eventually be forced
into B.Y.O.B. parties only.

We think it is fairly obvious that alcohol awareness has arrived on
the W&L campus. The university has made an effort to keep stu-
dents informed about alcohol in such ways as the Drug and Alcohol
Awareness Week.

What this means is there is a need for continuity on the W&L
campus. Why should the Mock Convention be allowed to print a
poster featuring two donkeys drinking and driving? Less blatant,
but still questionable is the fact that both the cups and the shirts for
the convention feature donkeys in the act of drinking beer.

We realize that parties are a large part of Mock Convention.
However, we hope that student organizations will soon realize that
it is unfair for some organizations such as fraternities to be re-
stricted in their references to alcohol while other organizations are
not. We believe the Executive Committee should study the problem
and try to find a solution.

Caution

Washington. and Lee students were fortunate-this past weekend-to..
have the opportunity to attend an AIDS symposium sponsored by.»

the university. Two of the nation’s top AIDS researchers gave pre-
sentations containing valuable information for today’s college stu-
dents.

John S. Knox, associate professor of biology at W&L, told a re-
porter that many W&L students do not understand the critical
nature of he AIDS problem. ‘‘Several students dismissed the sub-
ject as not pertinent to them. They did not understand the magnitude
of the problem,‘ he said.

At first it seems hard to believe that students at such a well-known
institution of higher learning would not understand the potential
danger of the AIDS virus to them. However, the conservative stu-
dent body at W&L does seem to be behind the times on the issues
occasionally. But on an issue as large as AIDS the student body
needs to catch up with the times.

It’s not a question of whether or not W&L has a homosexual
community. It’s a question of whether W&L has a sexually active
community. We feel it is safe to say that this university has the lat-
ter. When students understand this, they can begin to understand the
precautions that must be taken.

We applaud the university for the scheduling of the symposium.
We also hope that they will continue to provide information in such
ways to the students. It can only help, and may avoid a serious prob-
lem in the future.

Do journalists have ethics?

 

MY VIEW
By Margaret Pimblett

 

nalism. J

Last weekend, 27 people gathered
in Reid Hall to participate in the Jour-
i Institute, Ten W&L

   
 

 

nalism ethics course were joined by 13
professional journalists from both the
print and broadcast media, plus one
lawyer from Tennessee, two W&L
professors and one W&L administra-
tor.

I remember an old joke. One person
says, ‘I’m reading a book on journal-
ism (business, legal, medical, etc.)
ethics.’’ Second person says, ‘‘Must
be a short book.’’

We spent 21 hours during that
weekend discussing the ethics of jour-
nalism—the mental analysis which

enrolled i the jour-.

should take place during every editor-
ial decision. One notion generally held
among the journalists participating
was that the general public does not
realize or believe that journalists actu-
ally put some thought into what is
printed in the morning paper or seen
on the evening news.

That came as a shock to me. I guess
I expect non-journalists just to under-
stand why the news establishment pu-
blishes photographs of a family whose
son has just died, or why White House
reporters scream questions at Presi-
dent Reagan as he is boarding Air
Force One, or any of a number of
other questions which the members of
the public sometimes express.

The question about yelling at the
president is easy to answer. Thus far,
Ronald Reagan has had fewer press
conferences during his term in office
than either Lyndon Johnson or Ri-
chard Nixon. That worries me, and
should worry plenty of you. Because
the White House reporters are not gi-
ven the opportunity to question the
President in the White House briefing
room during a legitimate news event,
they must find themselves yelling on

the White House lawn while Ronnie
smiles, waves, and cups his ear to
hear the questions(which he’s not
planning to answer) over the roar of
the helicopter.

Now, about photographs of grief-
stricken family members... where is
the news value in publishing them?
Most journalists would say that the
death is a newsworthy event and the
reaction of the family is therefore
newsworthy. Call me a soft-hearted
liberal, but I don’t think that the ex-
pression of grief“#fter the death of a
loved one is terribly newsworthy. The

would be if the
family were laughing and having a
good time after the death of a child.
That would certainly be different than
how we expect people to react; be-
cause it would be unusual, it would be
newsworthy.

Of course, we can move from dis-
cussing photographs of dead people to
examining the interviews of survi-
vors. For example: An Ace Reporter
is talking to the mother of a child and
says, ‘‘Ma’am, your son was just run
over by a Mack truck and squashed
flatter than a pancake. How do you

feel right now?’’

While we’re on the subject of *
worthless questions, how about that ,

ABC Winter Olympics coverage? ‘‘I
have some good news and some bad
news. The good news is that you just
gave a terrific figure skating perfor-
mance. The bad news is that you lost
the gold medal. Reaction??’’ How in
the world could that announcer (I dar-
en’t call him a reporter) ask that ques-
tion? The athlete’s responses was
simple. ‘‘I’m disappointed. What
more can T say?” Exactly.

Yes, there are questions which
should be phrased differeftly, there
are photographs which should be held
from publication, there is video foo-
tage which need not be aired but
which is broadcast anyway because
someone thinks it will impress the au-
dience.

But there are also journalists who
pay attention to the opinions of the
readers and audience and who think
about what they use for the news, in-
stead of simply looking for the most
sensational stories and pictures. We
leave that to the Star and the National
Enquirer.

To the Editors:

I watched, read, and heard the media reports of
the uproar regarding the theme to this year’s
Fancy Dress Ball—with disappointment. If a lib-
eral arts university is supposed to ‘‘open minds,”’
WA&L is failing because the liberal agenda of the
faculty, administration, and certain student
groups is bent on snapping those minds shut—at
least minds that do not swallow the liberal agenda
whole.

Dissent leads to discourse, and discourse to
understanding. Or so the theory goes. Such a con-
dition cannot exist when only one interpretation,
the interpretation of the liberal civil rights move-
ment, is permitted vis-a-vis the theme of this
year’s Ball: ‘‘Reconciliation.”’

The period of reunion and reconstruction be-
tween the Confederate and Union States yielded
the thirteenth amendment (no slavery) and several
civil rights statutes that are vehicles for much liti-
gation even today. Such facts are irrelevant to
strident liberals who have an agenda to promote
and impose.

The original lofty civil rights goal of tearing
down artificial barriers (segregation, voting
rights) has taken on the stink of the sewer today as
it seeks to erect artificial barriers (forced busing,
quotas, set-asides in federal contracts). In the
words of Justice Thurgood Marshall, ‘‘You guys
have been discriminating for years... Now it’s our
turn.”’

The civil rights movement began to express a
moral imperative. Today, the movement is a
racket in which liberal constituency groups strug-
gle to classify themselves as ‘‘victims’’ so as to
get a share of the government largess earmarked
for ‘‘victims.’’ Being a ‘‘victim’’ is profitable, so
it should not surprise anyone that after 30 years of
the civil rights movement the circle of ‘‘victims’’
continues to grow.

The civil rights movement wants to re-write his-
tory, or suppress certain parts of it a la ‘‘The Rec-
onciliation Ball.’’ To many, me included, 1865
was a time of duty and honor, a time of pride and

 

 

LETTERS

heritage, a time of rugged individualism and dig-
nity in the face of defeat, and a time of fair ladies
and brave gentlemen, However, the civil rights
movement sees no good in 1865 because there was
some bad, and if anyone disagrees he is a racist.
So there!

‘*McCarthyism’’ is a misnomer for the destruc-
tion of one’s reputation by labeling—without sub-
stantiation—his ideas as antithetical to democratic
thought. The civil rights movement has its sacred
cows (the annual rite of agitating for sanctions
against South Africa, the claims that the death
penalty discriminates against blacks, the bogey-
man of cultural bias in standardized testing), and
if anyone disagrees with the movement’s position
on these and other issues, no ifs, ands, or buts, he
is a racist.

I disagree, and I can almost hear the liberals
moaning now: ‘‘He’s a racist.’’ I am disappointed
in the liberals on the faculty, in the administra-
tion, and in the student body who will not permit
me, and others, to disagree. W&L is failing in its
mission because they (the liberals) are engaging in
the ‘‘McCarthyism’’ of the 1980s.

Very truly yours,
James N.L. Humphreys

FD theme

To the Editors:

I read with much chagrin and dismay the furor
surrounding this year’s Fancy Dress theme—The
Reconstruction.

I was particularly irritated by the views of Miss

More comments on Fancy Dress theme controversy

Thompson, the Minority Student Association
spokesperson. I find her exception to the theme on
the grounds that it was somehow racist patently
absurd.

I fail to see how she could take offense with a
period in history which celebrated the Eman-
cipation of blacks and their subsequent installment
as citizens. Of course they, as history with the
benefit of hindsight shows, continued to be ex-
ploited until 1964.

However, contrast the speed and commitment
with which blacks emerged with the 1865 ‘‘E-
mancipation’’ of the serfs in Russia and the record
clearly demonstrates that the era (Reconstruction)
truly heralded a new beginning for blacks. The
period also recalls, for members of the Washing-
ton and Lee community, a time when the virtues
of chivalry and conduct as a gentleman were more
widely observed, especially in the person of
Robert E. Lee.

Given these two important themes: the emer-
gence of blacks and the age of American chivalry,
I find Miss Thompson views narrow-minded, bi-
goted and devoid of any historical perspective. I
only hope the MSA too benefits from hindsight
and is more prudent in selecting their next presi-
dent.

‘gender

“By Jim Lake
-Staff Reporter

 

 

_ _ the results of last month’s survey of
« nearly 1,000 W&L students should be
savailable by Friday, and a report out-
, lining the responses will be finished a
week later, according to the professor
‘whose class conducted the study.
David R. Novack said his sociology
research methods class has spent the
‘last five weeks entering the responses
,into the university computer system.
He said trial runs have shown only a
"few errors, and those should be cor-
atected by the end of the week.

The survey, which was conducted
‘outside of the Registrar’s Office dur-
,ing registration week, dealt with a var-

iety of topics but focused on gender-
related issues.

+ The survey included two coeduca-
tion questions, asking students how
they felt about the decision to admit
swomen and whether coeducation is in
the best interest of the school.

Because the computer program can
‘measure more than one variable at a
,time, Novack said his class will be

able to see how opinions on coeduca-
*tion vary according to class and sex.
, Novack said his research methods

 

 

issues’

class has conducted surveys in 1982,
1984 and 1986 but said this one is
somewhat different from the other
studies.

“In terms of the number of ques-
tions, it’s only slightly longer,’’ he
said. ‘The real shift is that, instead of
it simply being a questionnaire on
coeducation, we eliminated a number
of the questions that no longer seem to
be relevant.”’

Novack said some of the questions
on the 1986 survey were also included
this time so that the answers of this
year’s juniors and seniors can be
compared to the responses they gave
as freshmen and sophomores.

‘‘Two years ago, for example, it
was the freshman males who were
most opposed to coeducation,”’ be-
cause they felt W&L women were re-
ceiving special treatment, according
to Novack. He said his class is looking
forward to see if those men feel the
same way now.

Other questions examined the atti-
tudes students have about women in
society, careers, marriage and chil-
dren.

The study also dealt with student
body elections, the social lives of
W&L students, student satisfaction,
the amount of control the administra-
tion has in students’ lives and Trident.

to leave
next week

By Laura Dodge
Staff Reporter

 

 

At the end of March W&L’s Direc-
tor of Communications, Jeff Hanna
will leave his position in the univer-
sity’s Publications Office. Hanna has
accepted the title of director of college
relations at the College of Wooster in
Wooster, Ohio.

Hanna said he has been at W&L for
the past seven years. At first he wor-
ked in the News Office, and now as
director of four departments under the
heading ‘‘communications.”’

His responsibilities include the uni-
versity’s publications, news office,
sports information, and the print shop,
said Hanna.

Because of his office location and
nature of his position, he and his staff
of three spend most of their time with
publications.

The staff performs many tasks, in-
cluding the Alumni Magazine pub-
lished six times a year, W&L’s cata-
logues, admissions booklets, and all
Summer Program pieces.

Hanna says he will miss the staff in
the publications department.

‘The thing I’ll miss most about my
job is the people who work with me.
They’ re exceptional at what they do.”’

He thinks ‘‘we’ve made great
strides in our publications.”

Such improvements include an im-
proved Alumni Magazine, with signi-
ficant and varied articles, and a rede-
signed, color cover.

  

Jeff Hanna

The publications office recently
won the Grand Award for the Admis-
sions Office’s View Book, which de-
scribes the university. Hanna says the
View Book will be entered in a
national competition.

Hanna says he decided last Febru-
ary to move to Wooster for ‘‘the time
[with family], a new challenge, and
different problems to solve.’’

Wooster College is closer to his
home state of West Virginia, and his
alma mater—Oberlin.

Hanna says he visited Wooster and
‘‘liked the community.”

Along with his job as director of
college relations, Hanna believes he
“thas things to offer them in the way of
admissions. Different looks, different
ideas. I’ll see things in a new way.”’

As with anything new, Hanna says
he feels a ‘‘little scared,’’ yet excited
because the job presents ‘‘a chal-
lenge.”

At the same time, Hanna says W&L
will be a “‘hard place to leave. We'll
miss a lot of things about Lexington.”’

" Ethics seminar

discusses ‘sleaze’

 

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

When reading the daily strip of
Bloom County, or Doonesbury, or any
satirical cartoon, how often do you
question the intentions of the artist,
the implications of the cartoon, or the
reactions of the readers?

Journalists must make decisions
daily concerning the nature and impli-
cations of stories they write and pu-
blish. This past weekend W&L stu-
dents met with professional journalists
for a seminar entitled, ‘‘Institute On
The Ethics Of Journalism’’. The three
day seminar featured journalists from
all over the country who are active in
many aspects of media.

Friday evening Edward P. Bassett
gave the keynote lecture entitled,
‘This Side of Sleaze, the Line that
Wavers.”’

Bassett, a 1951 graduate of W&L,
addressed the concerns raised by the
Supreme Court case ruling of Jerry
Falwell versus Larry Flint.

The cartoon in question depicted
Falwell in an offensive manner. Chief
Justice William Renquist’s ruling
stated the cartoon in no way purported
to be factual, and there was no reck-
less disregard for the truth.

This ruling gave greater freedom to
satirical cartoonists and journalists.

Bassett concluded his speech with a

challenge to journalists to handle their
freedom and power with responsibi-
lity, distinguishing the appropriate
from the inappropriate.

Saturday and Sunday the students,
faculty, and professionals discussed
how to cover, with responsibility and
a sense of ethics, current issues facing
the media.

The participants also attended a lec-
ture Saturday morning entitled, ‘*Pu-
blic Health Policy on AIDS.”’

For the rest of Saturday and Sunday
the guest speakers prompted discus-
sion with their views of current ethics
in journalism and presented actual
cases and stories they found con-
troversial.

All the students involved are enrol-
led in Professor Ron MacDonald and
Professor Louis Hodges’ class of Eth-
ics in Journalism.

Faculty and students involved in the
weekend’s seminar felt it had been
very interesting and successful.

Junior Maguerite Ayers said, ‘‘It
was a great chance to rub elbows with
some heavy-hitting journalists and get
to know them as people.”’

The seminar drew journalists from
WDBJ-TV, The Roanoke Times &
World News, The Richmond News
Leader and Times Dispatch, and such
leaders in the profession as the chair-
man for the Society of Professional
Journalists, and the Executive Man-
ager of the Virginia Press Associa-
tion.

‘L.A. Law’ cited in
applications rise

 

From Staff Reports

 

Applications to the W&L School of
Law are up 25 percent over last year,
according to Susan Palmer, associate
dean of the law school, and part of the
reason for the increase is the popular-
ity of the L. A. Law television program
and the broadcasting of the Iran-
Contra hearings this summer.

Palmer said the law school has
received 1,200 applications for 120
spots in the law class of 1991. Last
year the law school received approxi-
mately 1,000 applications for the same
number of spots.

*‘Anytime lawyers are in the news,
such as with the Iran-Contra hearings
and L.A. Law, there is an increase in
interest in the law,’’ Palmer said. ‘‘It
is much like the increase in journalism
during Watergate in the seventies.”’

Palmer said the increase in applica-
tions to the W&L law school can also
be linked to the stock market crash last
fall and the general decline in the
business community.

““We are seeing lots of applications
from_ stockbrokers, portfolio man-
agers, and other business-related gra-
duates with M.B.A.s,’’ Palmer said.
**Investment banking has been a popu-
lar career choice for several years, but
it doesn’t seem to be as popular this
year as it has been in the past.’’

Palmer said many of the students
applying to the W&L law school this

year are older and have been out in the
business world for three or four years.

“‘We have more graduate degrees
and more career changers in this ap-
plicant pool than we have had in the
past,’’ she said. ‘“We have certified
public accountants, real estate
brokers, physicians, health care
professionals, and even-an abstract ar-
tist.”’

Some of these career changers,
Palmer said, are exploring ways to re-
late their former professions to the
law. For example, Palmer noted, the
physicians are interested in the law
from the perspective of malpractice
insurance and defending physicians
who are sued for malpractice. The ab-
stract artist is interested iti copyright-
ing laws and representing other ar-
tists.

The increase in applications at
W&L reflects a national trend. Ac-
cording to the Law School Admissions
Council, applications to law schools
across the country are expected to
number 75,000 to 80,000, an increase
of 17 percent. The number of appli-
cants to law schools peaked in the
mid-1970s at an estimated 85,000.

Palmer warns, however, that those
students who apply to law schools be-
cause of L.A. Law or the Iran-Contra
hearings may not understand what a
career in law means in the real world.

“The gulf between perception and
reality for most first year law students
is wide anyway,’’ Palmer said. ‘‘The
gulf between L.A. Law and reality is
even wider.”’

The Career Development and

Rick Heatley, director of Career
Development and Placement. The
presentation will be on Wednesday
from 4-5 p.m. in Rm. 109 of the

who have encountered frustrations
in their job search are invited to at-
tend.

Suicide in B-Flat will be directed
by W&L junior Delia Ford. Sui-
cide in B-Flat, set in the world of
American jazz, centers around the
investigation of two detectives into
the apparent-ewicide of a renowned
jazz musician. Shepard’s charac-
ters, more animations of itteas than
actual people, create this play’s
unique portrayal of an artist's pur-
suit of identity and creative free-
dom and the struggles which result
from this search.

The second play, The Frog
Prince by David Mamet will be
directed by W&L junior Monica
Burke. The Frog Price is an up- |
dated version of the fairy tale about |
a prince’s transformation into a |
frog and subsequent efforts to get a |
pure and honest woman to kiss him |

|
|

 

and return him to his former state.
Mamet’s adaptation of the play,
with its contemporary language,
transforms the medieval tale into a
modern comedy of love and loy-
alty.

Seven swimmers earn all-American

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

The W&L men’s swimming team
capped off its sparkling season with an
impressive | |th-place finish out of 69
teams in the NCAA Division III
championships last weekend in At-
lanta.

The Generals had seven swimmers
earn all-American or honorable men-
tion all-America honors in nine
events. The top eight finishers in each
event are all-Americans, while the 9th
through 16th spots earn honorable
mention all-America recognition.

“It was a team effort that got us to

11th,’’ said head coach Page Remil
lard, whose team completed its best
championship meet in six years. ‘*Our
goal last year was to be in the ‘sweet
16.’ It’s March Madness, it’s basket-
ball time so we try to identify our team
goals so that people understand what
our goals are.”’

Sophomore David Olson’ was
W&L’s top performer, earning all-
America status in seven events and
breaking three school records. He was
narrowly defeated in the 100- and
200-yard backstrokes, taking second
place in school record times in both
backstroke events. Olson also finished
fifth in the 200-yard individial medley
with a school record 1:55.49.

Lady netters take
two 9-0 matches

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L women’s tennis team
gained complete 9-0 victories at home
against Bridgewater on Tuesday and
Roanoke yesterday. Since these two
opponents are in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference, the Generals’
success balanced out a tough 9-0 loss
to Wellesley on Monday afternoon.
Wellesley beat W&L with a consider-
ably deeper and more experienced
team.

In the Bridgewater and Roanoke
matches, W&L swept through the sin-
gles matches. Scoring victories for the
Generals was freshman Jean Stroman,
who won at No. | singles, followed by
freshmen Kelly Martone and Kathy
Leake at No. 2 and No. 3 respec-
tively. Sophomore Teresa Southard
was back playing and winning at No.
4 with freshman Shawn Wert at No. 5
and junior Benny Savage at No. 6.

The doubles teams of Stro-
man/Leake, Martone/Wert and soph-
omore Lara Eggers and junior Martha
Christian also took their matches.

The players will readily admit that
they expected to defeat Bridgewater,
although head coach William Wash-

burn is hesitant to speak in terms of
‘‘anticipated victories’ and prefers to
commend his team on its strong per-
formance Tuesday.

Martone and sophomore Meredith
Attwell both found it difficult to assess
the match against Roanoke since both
teams viewed the Maroons as not
having one of their best days. Wash-
burn considered Roanoke to be more
of a challenge than predicted, and
called their team, ‘‘formidable.’’ But
other W&L players are consistent in
the opinion that Roanoke was not as
strong as the teams played so far, and
that the toughest opponents are yet to
come.

‘Emory and Henry will be a chal-
lenge,’’ said Attwell, ‘‘but we’ll see
what happens after spring break.”’

Attwell was referring to the team’s
training in Hilton Head during the up-
coming vacation, during which the
Generals will play several matches
against other teams.

Washburn was praiseworthy of the
team as a whole. ‘‘I feel that we are
beginning to pull together as a unit,”’
he said.

W&L’s next matches are tomorrow,
away at Randolph-Macon Women’s
College, and at home Monday against
Sweet Briar.

The Generals’ 200-yard medley re
lay team, consisting of Olson, sopho-
more Shawn Copeland and juniors
Moose Herring and Jeff Bercaw,
grabbed 8th place with a time of
1:37.34 to earn all-America awards.
The 400-yard medley relay team, con-
sisting of Olson, Copeland, Bercaw
and juniors David Reavy and David
Dietz, also were all-Americans, end-
ing up 6th with a school record
3:31.57. Dietz swam the freestyle an-
chor in the morning preliminaries but
Remillard changed to Reavy for the
finals, which. explains why five
swimmers garnered all-America hon-
ors.

Dietz’s position, to use it as an exam-
ple, to say, ‘Hey, that guy got your re-
lay to the bigs. It put your relay in a
position to score points and make all-
American,’’” said Remillard. ‘Dietz
put us in a position to do it and Reavy
brought us home, so all five get rec-
ognized for their performances.”’

Bercaw received honorable mention
all-American when he came in 16th
place in the 100-yard butterfly
(52.29). Copeland matched Bercaw’s
effort with an honorable mention all-
American swim of his own, taking
13th place in the 200-yard breast-
stroke in a school record 2:10.07. In

Offense, defense go sour in lacrosse loss

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Taking 89 shots but scoring on only
seven of them, the W&L lacrosse
team lost at home to Gettysburg 10-7
Saturday but will try to rebound Sat-
urday against Bowdoin.

The loss to Gettysburg marked the
second-consecutive game in which
W&L, 2-3, scored on less than one-
fifth of its shots. The 8 percent per-
formance Saturday followed 19 per-
cent shooting (9 of 47) against Lynch-
burg College on March 16.

“I don’t fault effort, and I don’t
fault choices of shots,’’ said head
coach Dennis Daly. ‘‘We just have got
to become more efficient.

‘‘We had some people that were
0-for-15 who are primary shooters for
us, and I was very surprised that, with
that number of shots, and with the
shots they were getting, they could not
score,’’ he said. ‘‘We are not making
the most of those opportunities.’’

Even with what may be a school-
record number of shots, Daly said
W&L’s inside shooting game was not
strong enough.

‘‘They obviously collapsed their
zone so that we could not get the in-
side shot as frequently as we would
have liked,’’ said Daly, who admitted
that, even when his team did get inside
chances, ‘*We blew them.”’

Things were not any better for

Two wrestlers
are Academic

all-Americans

 

From Staff Reports

 

For the fifth consecutive year W&L
has had representatives on the NCAA
Wrestling Coaches Association Aca-

. demic all-America team.

This year senior Steve Castle and
sophomore Lee Garlove were selec-
ted.

Castle, a chemistry major from
New Canaan, Ct., is a repeater from
last year’s Academic all-American
team. He had a 21-6-1 record wres-
tling at 118 and 126 Ibs. this year.

Garlove, a history major from Lou-
isville, Ky., had a 17-7-1 record at
142 Ibs.

‘‘T am extremely proud of both of
them,"’ said head coach Gary Franke,
‘They are outstanding people in the
classroom and on the wrestling matt."’

W&L on the defensiveehtl:’**Gettys-
burg took 27 shots, and we allowed 10
to score. That’s a concern,”’ he said.
“‘T thought we played pretty poorly
defensively.”’

Going into the game, Daly said he
was most concerned about Gettysburg
attackers Earl Kight and Orin Levine,
who scored 10 points against W&L
last year.

And the Generals handled those two
players pretty well Saturday, shutting
out Levine and allowing Kight only
one assist.

But six other Bullets did the damage
instead, with attackman Keith Flem-
ing and midfielder Robert Bruns each
recording three goals and one assist.

‘‘Any time we give up 10 goals on
27 shots, we’re not playing good de-
fense,’’ concluded Daly.

The game went back and forth
throughout the first half. W&L led 3-1
in the first quarter and 5-3 in the sec-
ond before the Bullets scored four

straight goals to take a 7-5 halftime
lead.

Despite dominating time of posses-
sion in the second half, the Generals
scored only twice in the last two
periods, on third-quarter goals by
senior midfielder Sandy Harrison and
sophomore attacker Chris Giblin. The
Bullets scored twice in the third quar-
ter and once in the fourth to lock up
the win.

Giblin led all scorers with five
points (2 goals, 3 assists). Senior mid-
fielder Robbie Stanton made two as-
sists but was shut out in 17 shots on
goal. Harrison, sophomore midfielder +
Chris Mastrogivanni, junior attack-
man John Ware and junior midfielders
Joe Caccamo and Stuart Geisel each
scored once for W&L.

For Gettysburg, goalie Brian Sulli-
van made 23 saves.

The Generals will play their next
game Saturday at 2 p.m. against a
Bowdoin College team that features

200-yard freestyle relay team of Olson
Herring, Bercaw and sophomore
Adam Morgan was 14th and the
400-yard freestyle relay team of Ber-
caw, Herring, Copeland and Olson
was 16th.

“‘It was our relays that really did
it,”’ said Remillard. ‘‘One man can’t
hold up the whole program. Olson did
an outstanding job of bringing in some
points, but you have to have your re-
lays there, and four of our five relays
scored.”’

Men score
Millersville,

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

 

The W&L men’s tennis team im-
proved its record to 7-3 in action this
week.

The Generals defeated Millersville
last Thursday 8-1. The victory was led
by junior Bobby Matthews, playing in
the No. | singles position for W&L,
who defeated nationally-ranked Oliver
Merrill of Millersville in straight sets,
6-2, 6-4. Merrill is a Division II all-
America doubles player as well.

W&L’s only loss came at the No. 2
position, where junior Robert Haley
lost for the second straight time. Mil-
lersville’s Mike Kennedy handled
Haley in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3.

On Saturday the Generals played
host to a tough D-I competitor, Vir-
ginia Tech. The Hokies were in the
hunt after the singles competition,
trailing 4-2, but the Generals closed
them out in doubles to seal the victory.

Haley moved up to the top position
again and beat Marc Bernstine 6-3,
6-1. Matthews, back at No. 2 for
W&L, downed Phil Payne 6-2, 6-0.
No. 3 seed senior David McLeod had
to go to extra games in each of two
sets to defeat Tech’s Ed Butterworth
7-5, 7-6. McLeod won the second set
on the first tie-break point.

Freshman John Morris, W&L’s No.
4 singles player, suffered his first sin-
gles loss of the season at the hands of
Brian Hogge, 6-1, 6-2. Morris’ sin-
gles record now stands at an impres-
sive 15-1.

Senior Chris Wiman, No. 5 for the
Generals this week, needed three sets,
including a tie-breaker in the second,
to beat Paul Calhoun 5-7, 7-6 (1), 6-4.
W&L’s No. 6 man, freshman Bill
Meadows, lost to Bruce Reistle 6-3,
6-3.

In doubles, the No. 1 W&L team of
Matthews and McLeod quickly put
away Tech’s top pair 6-0, 7-5. This
win gave the Generals five points in
the contest, clinching the win.
However, the other two doubles mat-
ches were far from over.

Although head coach Gary Franke
did not view the win over Tech as an
upset, he felt that ‘it was a good win
to get [against a solid Division I
team].”’

As soon as the Virginia Tech match
was over, the Generals climbed into a
W&L van for a night drive to David-
son College in North Carolina, where

W&L had a Sunday afternoon mat-
chup against the D-I power.

The Generals were mildly sur-
prised, to say the least, to learn that
the matches would be played on Da-
vidson’s clay courts, not the standard
all-weather surface ones. ‘‘It’s no ex-
cuse though,”’ said Franke on the sud-
den site change, ‘‘they were better
players.”’

The Generals were put out of the
running in the singles competition as
only Morris could pull out a win on
the slow courts.

Haley, at No. 1 for the Generals,
lost to Jim Thompson 6- 2, 6-3. Matt-
hews fell to Bill Young, a high-school
acquaintance of his, with a similar
score. McLeod lost to Sebastian Koch
6- 4, 6-4.

Morris improved his singles record
to 16-1 with a win over Davidson's
Carlos Ortega 6-3, 6-2, while Wiman
lost to Tim Haywood in three sets,
6-3, 0-6, 6-2. Meadows then bowed
out to Davidson’s Kurtis Zabell in
straight sets, 6-3, 7-5.

Bitter cold, snowy weather on
Monday morning led to the cancela-
tion of W&L’s home match against
Lynchburg College that day. Franke
called the game at | p.m., and said
there were no plans made for making
up the contest.

The final game for the Generals this
“week was on Tuésday against the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at Greens-
boro. W&L had no problem handling
the visiting team, sweeping the match
9-0.

The Generals travel to Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania this weekend,
where they will play two important
matches. On Saturday W&L will face
Swarthmore College, ranked No. 6 in
the D-III polls.

‘*This match will allow us to com-
pare ourselves to common oppo-
nents.’’ said Franke. Earlier in the
season, Swarthmore traveled to the
West coast, where they lost to No. 3
Santa Cruz 5-4, and No. 12 Redlands
9-0. The East coast team did manage
one win, defeating No. 5 Clairmont-
Mudd-Scripts 5-4.

Washington College, another strong
D-III program, is currently ranked
No. 2 in the polls Both matches
should be very close.

The Generals will return home to
play the Virginia Military Institute on
Tuesday at 3 p.m. on the upper courts.

W&L nine caught in three-game tailspin

 

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L baseball team is in its
most active part of the season right
now, but the postponed game against
Maryville on Monday gave them a
little bit of a breather.

A week ago, the Generals picked up
their first Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference win with a 11-3 victory over
Eastern Mennonite. W&L had 15 hits
with junior catcher Eddie Klank lead-
ing the way with four. Senior Eric
Acra went six innings for the pitching
win.

Last Saturday was a double-header
at home with Randolph- Macon. In the ,
opener, first-year law student Hugh
Finkelstein took the first pitch of the
day and deposited it over the fence to
give the Generals a 1-0 lead. Finkel-

stuin’s homer and five more W&L
runs weren’t enough, however, as the
hard-hitting Macon team (it had 26
hits in the two games combined) put
up 14 runs on the board to win the first
game 14-6.

Senior Carter Steuart started for the
Generals on the mound and juniors
Mike Temple and Dave Holland came
in for relief. In the second game, jun-
ior Chris Cunningham led off on the
hill for W&L with sophomores David
Smith and Sean Connelly coming in
for relief.

Junior Tom Skeen was 2 for 3 in the
second game, including a home run.
However, Macon was able to keep the
runs coming across the plate and fin-
ished off the Generals 13-4.

On Tuesday, the Generals played
host to the Hampden-Sydney Tigers
on Smith Field, and, although the
score was closer, the result was still

the same.

Hampden-Sydney got on top with
an early 3-0 lead. Then the Generals
were able score twice late in the game,
but the Tigers answered the W&L
comeback bid with two runs of their
own. In the bottom of the ninth, W&L
had runners on second and third with
two outs, but were unable to capi-
talize, leaving both stranded. Final
score: Hampden-Sydney 5, W&L 2.

The Tigers had 12 hits and 10 walks
that led to many base runners. Head
coach Jeff Stickley, whose team’s re-
cord stands at 4-4 overall (1-5 in the
ODAC), said that when you have that
many opportunities, it only takes a
few key hits to score a lot of runs.

Golf continues to find scoring ‘tough’

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

For the second-consecutive week,
the W&L golf team failed to break the
top 20 in multi-team invitational.

The Generals took 21st place out of
24 teams in the Max Ward Intercolle-
giate Invitational in North Carolina on
Monday and Tuesday. W&L was tied
for 20th after the first round of play
was completed.

Unlike the previous week’s perfor-
mance, head coach Buck Leslie did
not have high expectations for his
team.

‘We knew before we went down
there that this was a tough tournament

on a tough golf course,’’ he said. ‘*We
hadn’t been down there in a couple of
years because it was so hard on the
players’ scoring averages. "’

Senior John Gammage led all W&L
players with a two-day total of 171,
He received help from junior Tom
Wingfield and senior Gary Campbell,
who shot 176 and 179 respectively.

Leslie hoped that, although the
scores were high, his team picked up
some valuable playing experience

‘*You should benefit from tough
competition,”’ he said. ‘‘We went
down there to get some competition
rounds under our belts and, hopefully,
it was a learning situation.”’

All the players at the invitational

had to play under adverse condition.
Competing on a long, Bermuda grass
course without a practice round, many
players found the going tough on the
fairways.

After the first round of play, only
10 of the over 100 golfers managed to
break 80.

W&L will play today against Shen-
andoah and then tomorrow in an Old
Dominion Athletic Conference round
robin, both matches being held on the
General's home course at the Lexing-
ton Country Club. In the ODAC
round robin, the Generals will com-
pete against Bridgewater, Hampden-
Sydney and Randolph-Macon.

B’ News bound for Oscars

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

If the characters in Broadcast News
were putting personal ads in The
Washington Post they might say some
thing like this:

ton Bureau of a network television af-

well-schooled man who can carry on
an intelligent discussion and who en-
joys going out. Have a hard time
meeting parents for the first time. Call

- 1 WANT TO MEET YOU, REAL-
LY-Relatively Handsome Man, well,
kind of nice-looking in a way, a little
over 6 feet tall with curly, brown hair
(but not too brown or curly), field re-
porter for a Washington T.V. station
here in D.C. but hope to be an anchor
for the evening news sometime in the
near future even though that’s not
what I really want to do. Witty per-
sonality, not overly flippant or
critical, love my house, like my work,
hate my love life, loathe the new net-
work anchor. Am really a very pleas-
ant person. Honest friend. Have won-
derfully innovative way of making
screwdrivers and the inside track as to
who Satan really is. Would like to
meet cute, brunette, executive pro-
ducer to spend the rest of my life with.
Call ME-AARON, if you want to.

- LET’S PARTY-Great Looking head
anchorman for fhe Washington affi-
liate of the network news. Have a
knack for sweeping women off of
their feet. Interested in good-looking
woman who wants to have a good
time. Love going out to dinner,

the top of the journalistic world on my
looks. Am very good at flying by the
seat of my pants. Am a touch insecure
but love to talk. Very sensitive. Like
to travel. Call TOM-NEWS

It seems that Director James L
Brooks has done it again. For the first
time since his Terms of Endearment
came out in 1983, a film has been
released that completely encapsulates
the emotion and the sensitivity of love
and relationships while putting it in a
microcosmic view of society that
everyone can relate to.

Broadcast News has been heralded
since its release as the film to beat at
this year’s Golden Globe and Acad-
emy Awards. After seeing the film,
you will understand why.

Once again James Brooks has suc-
cessfully shown everyone what it
takes to achieve cinematic excellence.
Cinematic excellence is not about
excellent film; its about the cinemato-
graphy, the story, the actors and ac-
tresses, the construction of the film,
and the obvious care that goes into get-
ting each detail precisely the way the
director conceptualized it.

Brooks started with a concept of
caring, of love and of emotion and de-
veloped it into a story of three people
who love each other, and who hate
each other. They can’t live with or
without each other. It’s the perfect
friendship which is where the absolute
beauty of Brooks’ direction comes in.
Most directors do not know when to
stop. They don’t understand when
enough is enough. Broadcast News
doesn’t go too far; it’s just right.

While Brooks direction is wonder-
ful, he is only as good as his actors
make him appear. With William Hurt,
Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks, how
can he possibly look bad?

William Hurt’s performance as the
dashing anchorman in Broadcast
News rivals his Oscar-winning per-
formance as the transvestite in Kiss of
the Spider Woman as the finest of his
career. His insecure, yet commanding
Tom Grunick seems to have a genuine
realness about it that makes you won-
der if Hurt is acting at all. There is a

reserve in his character like a spring
that’s ready to jump, yet there is a fire
about him that puts a spark in every si-
tuation he encounters; especially those
involving Holly Hunter.

As good as Holly Hunter was as the
baby-napping Edwina in last year’s
Raising Arizona, that performance
can't touch the Jane Craig she has de-
veloped for Broadcast News. Though
only in her second major film, Hunter
seems to have a real command over
the emotions, faces, gestures and de-
tails it takes to be an Oscar-caliber ac-
tress. In Broadcast News she is con-
stantly on the edge, but like the rest of
the film, never passes out of the para-
meters of the realistic. Holly Hunter is
more wonderful than expected and
were it not for one other actor, would
be the most delightful surprise of the
film.

If James Brooks had looked his en-
tire life for someone to play the role of
Aaron in Broadcast News he couldn’t
have found anyone more perfect than
Albert Brooks. Aaron is a character
who doesn’t know who he is, where
he is going, or what he wants; but he’s
trying. He’s in love with Jane but he
doesn’t want her to know; not really
anyway. Albert Brooks is simply per-
fect in the part. His sensitivity gives
the part an authenticity that again
keeps the film from going overboard
or becoming a sappy, cliche commen-
tary on unfulfilled love. Instead,
Broadcast News draws on the hopes,
desires, and expectations of the au-
dience’s feelings of what could be.

In 1983, Terms of Endearment wal-
ked away from the Academy Awards
with five major Oscars including Best
Picture, Best Director, Best Actress
(Shirley MacLaine), Best Supporting
Actor (Jack Nicholson) and Best
Screenplay. If the Academy listens to
this year’s critics, Brooks may pull off
a repeat performance.

Broadcast News, has been Brooks’
obsession for the last six years and it
shows. The film has been nominated
for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best
Supporting Actor, Best Screenplay
and Best Picture and could very well
win them all.

William Hurt is the favorite for Best

From Staff Reports

This spring’s production of the VMI
Theatre is probably the most ambi-
tious undertaking the group has ever
attempted and involves a wide seg-
ment of the community in staging Ok-
lahoma, the Rodgers and Hammer-
stein classic which was one of the
pioneers of the Broadway musical.

With a cast of 31 performers, a ten-
piece orchestra and support personnel
of nearly 20, the musical comedy will
involve a wide segment of area resi-
dents, which includes students from
W&L, Southern Seminary and Lex-
ington High School, numerous local
theatre buffs, in addition to members
of the VMI family. The production is
in cooperation with the Rodgers and
Hammerstein Theatre Library.

Curtain time is 8 p.m. in Cameron
Hall for each of the six performances
slated, March 24, 25, and 26, and
March 31, April 1 and April 2. The
Friday and Saturday shows (March
25, 26 and April 1, 2) will be dinner

p.m. each night. Adults will pay only
$15 each for dinner and show, or $5
each for show only. Students and
senior citizens (60 or over) will be
charged $13 for the dinner-theatre
combination, or $3 for show only.
Cadets will be admitted free to the
show, but pay $10 for dinner. For re-
servations, call 463-6389 after 4 p.m.
Heading the cast are Cadet Patrick
D. McMahan, a junior from Arling-
ton, in the role of ‘‘Curly,’’ and Lex-
ington High School senior Heidi
Hickox as Laurey. McMahan is a sol-
oist with the VMI Glee Club and has
performed in summer theatre in his
home area. Hickox is well known to
local theatre fans for her roles in
Henry Street Playhouse productions.
Both are accomplished musicians.
Cadet Lance Gilman, junior from
Concord, N.H., will play Will Par-
ker, W&L sophomore Dee Dee Truett
handles the role of ‘‘Ado Annie,”’ and
Cadet Shannon Daly, freshman from
Leesburg, Va., is cast as Jud Fry.

Actor but will get heavy competition
from Michael Douglas nominated for
Wall Street. Hurt’s performance in
Broadcast News is much better than
his nominated performance of a year
ago for Children of a Lesser God but
the question is will it be good enough
to win him second Oscar in three
tries?

Like Hurt, Holly Hunter will get
some heavy competition for the Best
Actress award. This year’s list of
nominees is incredibly close and is
virtually a toss-up. Glenn Close put in
the year’s most chilling performance
in September's Fatal Attraction and
Cher continues to reap recognition for
her performance in Moonstruck. If
Holly Hunter wins it will be quite a
triumph for her.

Last year my ‘“‘If there’s a God,
He'll Win’’ pick was for Chris
Menges to win the Best Cinematogra-
phy award for his filming of The Mis-
sion which he won. This year, it’s Al-
bert Brooks for Best Supporting
Actor. You can bet the house on this
one. Albert Brooks will win the Best
Supporting Actor award at this year’s
Academy Awards. No question.

As for Best Picture, again it will be
close. Traditionally, if the Academy
can, it tends to give the Oscar to a his-
torical film such as Gandhi or Char-
iots of Fire. With Bernardo Bertoluc-
ci’s film The Last Emperio in the run-
close.
Nevertheless, Broadcast News will be
there and could very well win.

Unbelievably Brooks failed to get a
direction nomination as did any Amer-
ican director for the first time in the
history of the Academy Awards. Em-
pire of the Sun was nominated for all
kinds of awards but as has been the
sad tradition at the Oscars, Steven
Spielberg did not get a direction
nomination. Brooks has a good shot to
bring home the Screenplay award but
he’ll have to get by perennial Screen-
play favorite Woody Allen first.

Regardless of the way the Oscars
turn out, Broadcast News is a must for
you to see. This is one of the three
best films of the year. Don’t miss it;
especially since its finally here.

Dukakis wins nomination;
Gore swings second spot

 

: By Sean Bugg
* Staff Reporter

 

* Vlassachusetts Gov. Michael Duka-

"kis was the presidential nominee of the
« W&L Mock Democratic Convention,

and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore gar-
nered the vice-presidential nominee.
Dukakis was selected Saturday on
the second roll call ballot, with 61.29
percent of the delegate votes.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson finished

second with 25.25 percent of the

* votes.

7"

Gore finished third in the race for
the nomination, while Illinois Sen.
Paul Simon and Missouri Rep. Ri-
chard Gephardt finished fourth and
fifth respectively.

A simple majority was needed to
win the nomination. Dukakis placed

, first in the initial ballot, but with only

38.3 percent of the votes.

Simon and Gephardt lost the most
votes on the second ballot, with Simon
dropping from 139 to 16 votes, and
Gephardt dropping from 118 to 6.

Gore lost 74 votes and Jackson lost
only 71 in the swing to Dukakis. Gore

' won the vice presidential nomination
' on the first ballot with 1,018 votes out

of a possible 1,679.

Young says
convention
is important

By Sean Bugg
Staff Reporter

 

 

The mayor of Atlanta called the
Mock Convention an important event
leading to the national Convention this
summer in his keynote address at the
final session of the convention Satur-
day.

“*T see this as a prophetic conven-
tion,’ said Young, ‘‘helping the
nation and party determine the next
candidate and formulate opinions that
makes him the next candidate.”’

Young said the election process was
*‘serious business.’’

“If business is not growing it can’t
give leadership,’’ he said.

The collection of candidates for this
year’s Democratic presidential nomi-
nee is the finest he’s seen in years,
Young said.

Stressing what he views as Republi-
can mistakes, Young outlined ways in
which the Democrats need to work
with the presidency «

‘‘Nothing happens for good unless
we as a nation are involved in it,’’
Young said.

When the Republicans in 1973
abandoned Democratic policies that
had been in effect since World War II,
Young said, they were abandoning a
policy that had revitalized the nation,
as well as helped the recovery of
Europe and Japan.

Young cited the formation of OPEC
and the subsequent rise of oil prices as
well as the current economic situation,
including the current budget and trade
deficits. He said the Republicans have
taken protection away from American
taxpayers, ‘‘the same protection that

 

former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb
and W&L professor of history J.D.
Futch, who placed second in the vot-
ing.

When the convention was adjourned
around 1:30 p.m., Dukakis had not
yet been reached by Mock Convention
officials.

The session was called to order at
9:30 a.m., and the keynote address
was delivered by Atlanta Mayor An-
drew Young, who said afterward,
**The feeling you get...is very similar
to a real convention.”’

The W&L Mock Convention began
in 1908 when it correctly predicted the
presidential nomination of William
Jennings Bryan. Since then the con-
vention has established a well-known
success record in choosing the nomi-
nee of the political party not in the
White House at that time.

In the past nine conventions, the
students have only been wrong once.
In 1972 they chose Edward M. Ken-
nedy as the Democratic nominee in-
stead of George McGovern.

The convention has been called
“‘the biggest and boomingest’’ by
Time magazine, and ‘‘the most real-
istic’? by Newsweek magazine.

“It has served both parties well in
the past for 45 years or so,’’ said Vir-
ginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, who
gave greetings to the convention from
the state in the first session yesterday.

While Albert Gore may have es-
caped with the vice- presidential
nomination in last weekend’s Mock
Convention, there was a strong, if not
quite nationally known, candidate
who finished in second place.

‘Second place was disappointing,
but the honor of being nominated is
long overdue,’’ said Jefferson Davis
Futch, Il, professor of history at
WAL.

Futch was nominated for the vice-
presidential spot along with Arkansas
Goy. Bill Clinton, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and University of Kentucky
basketball star Rex Chapman, among
others.

Of the man who defeated him in the
balloting, Gore, Futch said, ‘‘A major
league turkey, a gold medal, blue-
ribbon turkey.

*‘Nobody ever said I’m a good
loser,’’ he added.

What would his first action be if he
was vice-president of the United
States?

 

 

 

Futch misses nomination

‘*T would revert to Renaissance poli-
tics and I would arrange for the presi-
dent’s prompt poisoning.’’

And after assuming the presidency?

“I'd break relations with the evil
empire, abolish the income tax, disso-
lve the bureaucracy and go home to
Monticello.”

Futch also had observations on
other candidates for the presidency.

Dukakis: ‘‘I think he should go back
to Greece and become chairman of the
socialist party there.”’

Jackson: ‘‘I’m not going to get up at
6 a.m. to vote for him.”’

Bush: ‘‘A charming non-entity with
a wife with whom I wouldn’t want to
tangle.”’

Robertson: ‘‘I think the holy Pat is
God’s future viceroy on earth and he’s
a shoo-in in 1992.”’

The Democratic Party: ‘‘It’s not
publishable in a family newspaper--or
a kiddy newspaper.”’

Futch’s favorite Democrat is
‘‘Mario Cuomo’s mother, Immac-
ulata.’” Why?

‘*Because she loves capital punish-
ment and wants to fry everybody.’’

tax dollars bought our enemies after
World War II.’’

Young said that American strength
is of importance world-wide.

‘*Everybody in the world wants a
strong America,’’ he said. Even Rus-
sia wants a strong America as a deter-
rent for military radicals in their
system, he said.

‘‘The Japanese government could
not survive without America to
protect their markets and access to the
world,’’ he said.

‘It is not for them to decide what is

a strong America,’’ Young said.

Young called education the biggest
factor in a strong United States and
called for a renewed commitment to
providing education to all Americans
at prices they can afford.

Education is ‘‘the best investment
we can make as a nation,”’ he said.

Young said the investment would be
paid back not only in repayment of
loans but in the tax money and de-
velopment educated Americans would
contribute.

Student reaction is very positive

Co-Editor

 

If the reputation of the Mock Con-
vention awed it’s participants it cer-
tainly didn’t show it in their actions.

Dax Cummings of the New Hamp-
shire delegation said he didn’t re-
member much of the Friday sessions
but said ‘‘he loved the parade. I loved
the way all the people of Lexington
looked at all of us. They loved us.

‘*The floats were great. I think we
should do it for homecoming; have all
the fraternities make floats. It would
be great,’ said Cummings.

Rick Silva, the State Chairman from
New Hampshire, agreed that the par-
ade was interesting and added, ‘‘[The
convention] is a hell of an event. I
wasn’t expecting half this much. The
committee went out of their way to
really make sure this is authentic.’’

Alcohol helped the loose atmos-
phere at the Convention. Fancy Dress
Ball may have been dry, but the Mock
Convention was most certainly not.

Esther Huffman, a delegate from
Washington, had a sign which read
‘‘Dukakis in ‘88’’ on the front and
‘‘Beam and Coke’’ on the back. She

said, ‘‘These are the things that we
support. That’s our entire platform.”’

Christian Bevington of the Georgia
Delegation said, ‘‘I think drinking is
definitely a main aspect of the whole
thing.”

Friday night's sessions featured
speakers from the National and Vir-
ginia State Democratic Party.

Ted Hart from Tennessee said,
‘*These people who are getting up and
speaking are gettin razzed pretty bad
by all the Republicans.”’

Wyatt Bassett, also of Tennessee,
agreed. ‘‘There are more Democrats
on the podium than there are in the
audience.”’

Saturday’s session was the nominat-
ing session.

Frank Watson of the Nevada dele-
gation thought Saturday’s session was
‘‘a little bit more calm and control-
led.?"

Stuart Sheldon of the Minnesota
Delegation also thought Saturday’s
session was a little more subdued.

He said, *‘The crowd is much less
unruly than last night and I think that’s
probably because they're pretty fa-
tigued from activities that probably
occurred after the convention last
night.

*‘Of the three sessions [Saturday] is
definitely the brass tacks of the con-
vention. I think everyone understands
that this is where all the action
occurs,”’ said Sheldon.

After the first ballot, when no can-
didate had enough delegates for nomi-
nation, the Convention had to go to a
second ballot to pick a winner.

Jon Solomon, State Chair for Flor-
ida thought the second ballot added
excitement and realism to the Conven-
tion.

He said, ‘‘I think [the second ballot]
is extremely realistic because we have
all the backroom playing I expect to
see this summer in Atlanta [at the ac-
tual Democratic Convention. }’’

Jim Sloat, New York State Chair,
agreed.

‘*As far as realism, yes, I think this
is it.

‘*The first ballot you have commit-
ted delegates, they’re going to have to
stay the way they are,’’ said Sloat.
‘The deal that’s going to be cut be-
fore the convention is going to reflect
what we are doing right now. So I
think a second ballot reflects exactly
what’s going to happen.”’

The class elections on March 21
yielded few clear winners and set the
stage for the big run-off elections on
the 24th.

 

~ ers Giblin waselected junior.

offs, while 272 ballots were tabulated
for the senior class elections.

Mock Convention brings
world’s media to Lexington

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

Reporters came from as far away as
Denmark, Austria, and Japan to cover
the 1988 Mock Democratic Conven-
tion.

In all, more than 40 reporters repre-
senting newspapers, radio stations,
television affiliates and wire services
reported on the convention.

Many of the foreign journalists
came a day early to attend a seminar
entitled ‘‘The Race of ’88’’ sponsored
by the United States Information
Agency and the W&L Department of
Journalism. Susan Hedges from the
Saudi Press Agency said, at this point,
she is ‘‘not following the presidential
election closely.’’ She said because
she does plan to cover the national
convention, she attended the seminar
and Mock Convention in order to get
background information and to under-
stand the electoral process better.

Most of the foreign journalists
heard about the Mock Convention at
the Foreign Press Center in Washing-
ton D.C. According to Hedges, Mock
Convention Media Chairman Tim
Bolling and the USIA did ‘‘a very
good job of publicizing’’ the event.

Christen M. Schmidt of Denmark's
Politiken said the Mock Convention
‘‘is a great opportunity to learn about
the process without actually having to
work hard to follow the events and
also have a lot of fun.”’

According to Schmidt, the people of

Denmark are very interested in the
U.S. presidential election. ‘‘I think
it’s more important to us who’s the
president of the United States than
who’s the prime minister of Den-
mark,’’ said Schmidt.

Schmidt said that he will write a
small feature story on W&L’s Mock
Convention.

Lauren Silva-Pinto of the Austrian

Radio & TV said that she heard about
the convention through one of the
cameramen on her crew who is a
W&L alumnus, as well as through the
Foreign Press Center.

“We're going to do a five-minute
feature story about the Mock Conven-
tion,”’ said Silva-Pinto. The story will
be broadcast on Austria’s state-run
news organization, ORF, she said.

“‘It is interesting to add that ORF is
also seen in parts of Hungary, Cze-
choslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Poland,
so the Mock Convention will have a
greater exposure than what is norma-
lly expected in Europe, I think,’’ said
Silva-Pinto.

Silva-Pinto says that she knows the
American political system, particu-
larly the electorial process, can be
very confusing for Europeans and
thinks that ‘‘this feature that we are
going to do will allow the Austrians to
get a much better handle on how the
convention actually works.”’

Closer to home, most Virginia
newspapers, radio and _ television
stations carried coverage of the Mock
Convention.

Television stations in Richmond,
Charlottesville, Roanoke, Lynchburg,
Harrisonburg, and Washington D.C
sent crews to the convention. In addi
tion, Cable News Network carried a

story it received from WDBJ-TV in
Roanoke.
Radio stations from Lexington,

Staunton, and Richmond covered the
convention. Radio reporters from the
Virginia New Network and the Voice
of America were also at the conven
tion.

Newspapers from Toledo, Ohio,
Norfolk, Richmond and Roanoke sent
reporters. United Press International
and the Associated Press wire services
also carried stories on the event

Mary Ellin Arch, of United Press
International, said that UPI has been
following the progress of W&L’s

Mock Convention for months.

‘*We did a story when they forecast
the lowa caucus winner and when they
forecast the New Hampshire primary
winner. We also did a story on their
predictions for Super Tuesday. And
then when they were right 17 out of
the 20 races, we did another story on
that,’’ said Arch.

“*Everybody knows about this con-
vention,’ said Arch. UPI did both
news wire and broadcast stories, she
said.

Tana Castro of WVPT-TV, Virgin-
ia’s public television in Harrisonburg,
said that it will carry a ‘‘profile of the
whole convention’’ on its magazine
show Skyline Illustrated, as well as
carrying smaller stories on its news
programs.

The magazine segment will be be-
tween six and ten minutes, said Cas-
tro.

Castro said that she heard about the
event from alumni on her crew as
well.

‘You all have a fabulous public re
lations department down here, and we
get a lot of story ideas from them, but
also several employees of the station
attended W&L or attended one of the
schools near W&L,"* she said.

Mark Roberts of WDBJ-TV_ in
Roanoke said that he tried to cover the
issues behind the convention,

“We going to try to get some type
of perspective on this thing. Don’t just
throw it out and say ‘100 students at
W&L want Dukakis to be president.’
I’m going to try delve into some of the
issues such as this is a very conserva-
tive Republican campus, and yet they
base it on the party that’s not in
power. I think that’s kind of an inter-
esting twist,’* said Roberts

Lillian Clark of WANV-FM_ in
Staunton said that she was covering
primarily the speeches of Lt. Gov

OPINION

 

Obnoxious

Over all, the 1988 Mock Democratic Convention seems to have
been a success. Hopefully, after this summer’s real Democratic
Convention in Atlanta, we will know that it was also accurate. Re-
gardless of its success, however, there was a problem we would like

to point out.

Unfortunately, W&L students have the ability to be exceptionally
rude and obnoxious. During former Gov. Charles Robb’s speech,
the student audience was so loud it was extremely hard to hear, and
Robb had to stop to ask for the audience’s attention.

Later that Friday night the delegates engaged in such ou-
trageously obnoxious and offensive debating on the platform that
we will not even go into the specifics here. However, The Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch did use those specifics.

It’s a shame that when the eyes of the world are upon us, students
have to get so out of control they cast a bad light on the school.
Hopefully the next time W&L is at the center of attention, students
will have matured enough to participate rationally.

America’s betrayal

of freedom fighters

 

MY VIEW
By John Roach

 

The year is 1956 and the Hungarian
people rise up against the oppression
of the Soviet Union. The freedom-
fighters are urged to continue their
fight by the United States and are
promised U.S. support. The Hungar-
ians rid themselves of the Soviets only
to be betrayed by the U.S. when the
Soviets roll through their country a
short time after the successful revo-
lution. It takes only four more years
for the U.S. to betray another group of
patriotic freedom-fighters. As the
U.S. trained freedom-fighters landed
at the Bay of Pigs, in an attempt to
free their country from Castro, their
much needed and promised air sup-
port was reneged upon by President
Kennedy. The list of betrayals goes on
and on and last week’s events in Ni-
caragua close a chapter on the latest
U.S. betrayal of freedom- fighters in
their cause against the most evil em-
pire in our world today.

The cease-fire accords signed in Ni-
caragua last week between the Sandin-
ista Marxists and the Nicaraguan re-
sistance signify a shameful moment in
U.S. history. This cease-fire was for-
ced upon the freedom-fighters, for it
was their only alternative to slaughter.
When Congress cut off aid to the free-
dom-fighters last month the resistance
had no option but to accept a Vietnam
“‘peace with honor’’. It is indeed a
tragedy that the 10,000 freedom-
fighters were set adrift after such a
successful year in 1987. The resis-
tance last May had eliminated former
Somoza supporters, began operations
in over two-thirds of Nicaragua in
July, and through these successful
operations brought Daniel Ortega to
the bargaining table in October.

One shakes his head in bewilder-
ment over the liberals’ support of a
Soviet colony in Central America.
The freedom- fighters were bringing
the Sandinistas to their knees and the
liberals led by Jim Wright and Tony
Coehlo shattered the dreams of liberty
of the Nicaraguan people. Their cow-
ardly opposition to the aid package
offered by President Reagan led to the

cut-off of all aid at the end of Febru-
ary. Ortega and his junta of Commu-
nist thugs immediately began prepar-
ing for a deathblow to be dealt at the
resistance.

The Sandinistas’ recent incursion
into Honduras was this planned final
act to eliminate the fighters who wan-
ted a true people’s revolution. It
shows that the resistance was a threat
to Ortega, for he was willing to risk an
international outcry against his viola-
tion of the borders of Honduras to rid
the Sandinistas of the very serious
threat that the freedom-fighters posed.

It is amazing that anyone could ac-
tually trust Daniel Ortega in the way
the liberals do. He promises to follow
the Arias ‘‘peace plan’’ and makes
only token moves to loosen the chains
of bondage that are wrapped around
the people of Nicaragua. This is
enough for the liberals whose mantra
is,“‘let’s give peace a chance’’. This
dubious settlement has been achieved
at the cost of denying the Nicaraguan
people the rights that we consider in-
dispensable for ourselves. The press
has reported that peace has been
reached in Nicaragua and that Daniel
Ortega and the Communist clan have
promised many reforms. These re-
forms are pipe dreams in the same
way that the 1973 Paris Accord which
brought ‘‘peace’’ to Vietnam was a
pipe dream. That peace was brought,
but the price was high. We abandoned
an ally while he was gasping for
breath and the result was the consoli-
dation of Communism in Southeast
Asia and the near- genocide of the
people of this region. We have now
helped Ortega secure his power and
like all good Communists he will now
look to expand the tyrannical creed
that rules his life.

This expansion will be at the ex-
pense of the fragile democracies of
Central America and instead of the
Nicaraguan resistance’s holding the
line against Communism and creating
another democracy in Nicaragua, the
leaders of Central America will plead
for American boys to come to protect
them from the Ortega brothers. And if
these troops are sent let us never for-
get that their blood as well as the
blood of the Latin American people
whose lives will be lost in the fight
against Marxism will be on the hands
of Jim Wright and his liberal collea-

gues.

Give Fool’s Day the proper respect

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

America is currently faced with
many problems. At home, the deficit
is so big that if all the presidential
candidates donated their campaign
budgets to the government it would
take two presidential elections to elim-
inate. Foreign affairs don’t look much
better, with Nicaraguan communists
expected to take over Los Angeles by
the end of the week. Still there are
more important issues; issues which
demand immediate attack.

Perhaps the most critical issue is
holiday reform.

Midnight tonight marks the begin-
ning of a significant day in American
history, April Fools Day. It also
marks the continuation of an Ameri-
can tragedy, because otherwise-
patriotic citizens have been treating
the first of April with unwarranted in-
difference instead of deserved vener-
ation. As a holiday reformer, my first
responsibility is to help the reader de-
velop an appreciation for America’s
great holiday.

It all started on April 1, 1492, with
a young prankster and opium addict,
Christopher Columbus. Christopher
played a big prank on the king of
Spain. Using maps bought at a toy
store he fooled the king into believing
the world was round. Then he convin-
ced the king to give him 1000 gold
pieces, the queen, and his best ship in
order to find a placed called America.

Before Chris could tell him it was a
prank he was sailing away with a 1000
gold pieces, the queen, and a great
ship. As you know, Chris and his
crew of Zen Buddhist sailors actually
found a place named America. Of

course, the trip did have its tragic
moments. When food ran low the
crew was forced to violate the Zen
oath of vegetarianism by having the
queen for dinner.

(Important Note: Many first grade
teachers have been telling a different
story about Columbus and his dis-
covery of America. Anti-American
elementary school superintendents are
largely responsible for this distortion
of a historical event.)

Now that the reader has realized
America as we know it could not have
existed without April Fool’s Day, he
or she must now learn how to treat this
holiday with proper respect and dis-
tinction by becoming an expert prank-
ster. Of course, the only way to be-
come an expert prankster is to study
an expert prankster, such as myself, in
action.

The date is April 1, 1987. I have
just walked into the kitchen for break-
fast where my mother is innocently
reading the newspaper. You are about
to witness a flawless execution of
April Fool’s Day rule number one:
Have no mercy on gullible family
members. I sit down without a word
and peer sadly into my breakfast.

Mom: Jon, is everything okay?

Jon (bursting into tears): No! Yes-
terday we got the test results back
from the high school literacy test you
need to pass in order to graduate. I
failed.

Mom (very concerned): What hap-
pened, Jon. I mean, you’re no genius
but at least you can read.

Jon (after 10 minutes of lame ex-
cuses as to why I failed): Ha Ha Ha
Ha! April Fools!

As my mother contemplates why
she had me, I bask in sweet victory.
But like all experts I was already wait-
ing like a hungry tiger for my next vic-
tim. Then my twin sister Shannon
(nicknamed Gurb by me) walked into

the room. My sister is quite a socialite
and loves to party, which brings me to
rule two: Pick pranks which hurt the
victim the most. While Gurb reads the
comics I reflect on her love for par-
ties, which leads me to start some ca-
sual conversation.

Jon (matter of factly): Hey Gurb,
did you hear they just raised the drink-
ing age to thirty?

Gurb (in extreme anguish): But that
will ruin tonight's party.

Jon (after explaining to her why it
was raised for 20 minutes): Ha Ha Ha
Ha! April Fools!

Gurb and I soon arrive in home-
room where I have already planned
out the strategy for my next prank.
This brings up rule three: Get bitter
prank victims to help you carry out
pranks on friends. I sit down without
saying a word to my best friend, Paul,
and stare sullenly at the desk.

Gurb (whispering to Paul): Don’t
bother Jon, Washington and Lee just
found out about the time you two stole
that car. They just revoked his accep-
tance.

Paul (greatly concerned): No! We
didn’t mean to steal that car. It just
happened.

Gurb (makes him feel worse): My
Dad is throwing him out of the house.
Paul is overwhelmed with guilt when I
break out in tears (Note: crying is a
very helpful April Fool’s Day techni-
que).

Jon (after 10 minutes of muffled
sobs): Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! April
Fools!

Using rule three again, Paul and I
fake a fist fight in physics. Even
though the dean gave us three days of
work detail it was worth it. This exhi-
bits rule four: Don’t hesitate to make a
sacrifice if it’s in the interest of a good

prank.
At this point I felt confident enough
to try a large-scale prank using rule

i

five: Manipulate current news events.
As I sit in English class I remember
that the Supreme Court has just ruled”
that surrogate mother Mary Beth
Whitehead could not keep the child, .
but must honor the contract she signed
and give the child to the paying father, ©
Dr. Stern. When the class quiets ’
down, I pick the right moment.

Jon: Mrs. Walker (English teacher)
do you have a radio? I just heard Mary *

Beth Whitehead committed suicide. °

We could probably hear it on the
news.

Mrs. Walker (the whole class is
stunned): No! Really?

Jon (after the class spends 10
minutes flipping radio channels): Ha
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! April Fools!

Mrs. Walker: You just failed my |

class.

Unfortunately, most of my pranks *
were not fit to be published in a news-

paper. Let me remind you of a few

things though. Rule six: Be careful, «

pranks can backfire. Note what hap-

pened when I tried a prank on my gir)- ©

friend.
Jon: You know Honey, I think we’-

re getting too serious. Let’s break it |
off for a while. ‘

Girlfriend: (she has no sense of
humor): I’m so glad you said that. I’ve
been struggling for a way to tell you
the same thing.

Rule seven: Be realistic. Walking

up to a friend and saying, ‘‘Happy »
April Fools. By the way, I just set .

your car on fire,’’ won't fool anyone
unless your friend happens to be a
very gullible Spanish king from the
fifteenth century.

Finally there is rule eight: avoid go-
ing too far. Locking a friend in the
bathroom and throwing in a canister
of nerve gas is a prank you might
come to regret.

In closing, I urge you to do your
part for America and show your
patriotism! Wage prank warfare on
Society:

LETTERS

Fancy Dress and MSA boycott bring in alumni opinion

To the Editors:

I am boycotting Fancy Dress this year, too. The
theme of this year’s ball is in very bad taste in-
deed, considering the history of our University.
It’s really rather like the Germans holding a
; ‘Treaty of Versailles’’ party.

Seriously, though, I believe I understand the
Minority Student Association’s gripe. But I think
they’re letting emotion cloud reason in this case.
They object to the selection of a theme depicting
‘ta period in which blacks were oppressed.’’
Blacks have been oppressed, in one way or an-
other, from these States’ colonial beginnings until
very recent times. Can we not have F-D themes
relating to any period prior to Brown v. Board of
Education?

Surely one can celebrate some aspects of a
period without celebrating all. If the theme were
‘*Ancient Athens’’, who would suggest that we
were glorifying slavery? Yet Athenian ‘‘democra-
cy’’ relied on slavery every bit as much as the old
South. And nobody would suggest that, since the
majority of blacks in ancient Athens were most
likely to have been slaves, blacks could not parti-
cipate with dignity and good humor in the fes-
tivities.

Picking the end of the War Between the States
as a theme does not show ‘‘nothing other than bla-
tant disregard for [black people’s}] achiev-

 

ements.”’ It says nothing at all about black peo-
ple’s achievements, just as it says nothing about
Irish- American or Chinese-American people's
achievements.

Actually, that period was a very hopeful time
for blacks, until the Republican party showed that
it was more interested in using blacks to punish
the South and to establish a permanent Republican
ascendancy, than in actually improving the lives
of the people whose jobs (albeit oppressive jobs)
they had recently taken away.

Aren’t there worthier causes for the MSA to
commit its moral energy to? This ill-placed indig-
nation over such a trivial issue makes a valuable
and important part of the University community
seem picayune and petulant. I wish they'd lighten
up, go to the doggone party, and have a good
time. It’s their party, too.

Sincerely,
James D. Crutchfield, '87L

Delegating thanks

Dear Editor:

On behalf of Don Thayer and myself, I would
like to publicly thank the members of the New
York state delegation to the 1988 Mock Democra-

tic Convention. They formed the most spirited
and dedicated delegation in the Warner Center.
Their research and fund raising prior to the Con-
vention prepared us for our task. They also built a
great float and cheered louder than anyone else.
Thank you again for your great work!
Sincerely,
Jim Sloat

Thanks to all

To the Editors:

We would like to take this opportunity to thank
the students, faculty, and administration of Wash-
ington and Lee University for their support and
enthusiasm during the 1988 Mock Convention.
We could not have carried it off without the help
of literally everyone on campus, and we thank
you. In the face of much debate about apathy at
W&L, we were very proud to be responsible for
an activity in which over 80 percent of the student
body actively participated. Thanks again.

Civil War scholars
to study Jackson

oa

By Margaret M. Pimblett
Staff Reporter

 

More than 100 Civil War scholars
and enthusiasts will meet in Lexington
in April for the second Stonewall
Jackson Symposium, sponsored by the
Garland Gray Research Center of the
Stonewall Jackson House.

*‘We have people coming from all
over the country,’’ said Michael
Lynn, the director of the Jackson
House. At least 16 states and Ontario,
Canada, will be represented at the
conference.

Plans for this symposium have been
under way since shortly after the first
one in April, 1986, Lynn said. Promo-
tional brochures were mailed in early
February to Civil War round table
groups and people who regularly
receive Jackson House mailings.

The symposium was completely
booked by mid-March, Lynn said, and
includes about a dozen people who at-
tended the first conference. The sym-
posium, to be held April 15, 16 and
17, will include eight lectures about
Stonewall Jackson, the Confederate
general who lived in Lexington for 10
years immediately before the Civil
War.

The first event of the weekend, and
the only one open to the public, will
be Friday evening’s keynote address
given by Frank Vandiver, the presi-
dent of Texas A&M University. He
will present a lecture titled, ‘‘One of

the Great Captains: Stonewall Jack-
son,’’ in Lee Chapel at 8 p.m.

The remainder of the weekend’s ac-
tivities will be limited to those people
who have pre-registered for the sym-
posium and paid the $100 registration
fee.

Vandiver, a historian who specia-
lizes in military history, has written
and edited 20 books and at least 100
scholarly articles and reviews. He is
the author of Mighty Stonewall, a bio-
graphy of Jackson, and Their Tattered
Flags: The Epic of the Confederacy.

The speakers for the weekend,
Lynn said, ‘include acknowledged
scholars who are widely published,
and some up-and-coming scholars’ of
Civil War history.

Other speakers include A. Wilson
Greene, Robert Krick and James Og-
den, all historians at the Fredericks-
burg and Spotsylvania National Mili-
tary Park; William Davis, a former
editor of Civil War Times Ilustrated,
Gary Gallagher, assistant professor of
history at Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity; James Robertson, the C.P. Miles
professor of history at Virginia Tech
and J. Holt Merchant, professor of
history at W&L.

All of the lectures except for Van-
diver’s will be held in Northen Audi-
torium.

In addition to the lectures, the sym-
posium will include tours of the VMI
Museum, a service and tour at Lexing-
ton Presbyterian Church, where Jack-
son worshipped, and tours of the

Baliles: Democrats
to bring Americans

 

By Sean Bugg
Staff Reporter

 

That America needs to regain its
consensus was the message Virginia
Gov. Gerald L. Bafifé’delivered Fri-
day when he greeted the Mock Demo-
cratic Convention on behalf of the
state of Virginia.

‘‘We must regain the American

consensus,’’ Baliles said to the en-
thusiastic audience at the convention.
“‘T will submit to you, that within this
hall, we have the instrument for doing
so.”’
Baliles said political parties need to
bring the American people together
“‘to stabilize the body politic, to move
the country forward.”’

‘*A political party is neither to be a
debating society nor a social club,’’ he
said. ‘‘Our purpose is to select and
support candidates for political of-
fice.”

The Democrats need to nominate
someone who can handle the budget
deficit, promote growth in science and
the economy, and bring the American
people together, said Baliles.

“‘Give us a candidate who will bring
us consensus,’’ he said. ‘‘And, while
you are at it, give us a candidate who
can win.”’

To do this, Baliles said, the political
parties ‘‘must be resolute and princi-
pled.’’

Baliles called the Mock Convention
‘ta most important and critical exer-

cise in democracy.”’

He was greeted with cheers and
flag-waving when he said, ‘‘For it will

Only one W&L student is registered

Lynn said. She said the conference
was planned during a vacation so that
Northen Auditorium would be avail-
able and parking would be less of a
problem.

‘*We are grateful to have the use of
the university facilities,’’ Lynn said,
because the Stonewall Jackson House
does not have a lecture hall and would
be unable to hold the conference on

Lynn said another symposium is
tentatively planned for April 1990.
The advantage to holding the event
every other year is to allow time for
new scholarly research, to maintain
interest and to allow for the practica-
lity of a small museum to sponsor such
a large gathering, she said.

Virginia’s governor remains un-
committed to any presidential can-
didate and plans ‘‘to serve Virginia
by helping broker the conven-
tion,”’ if the Democratic race for
delegates yields no clear front-
runner.

Gov. Gerald L. Baliles spoke at
the Mock Convention and after-
ward took questions from repor-
ters.

‘*We may be closer to the situa-
tion [a brokered convention] than
ever before,’’ Baliles said.

would be in a brokered convention,
the governor said part of the

Baliles said ‘the convention re-
sults may be helpful’’ going into
the Democratic Convention this
summer in Atlanta. He cited the
‘“‘amazing accuracy’’ of the stu-
dent-run convention in the past.

“It has served both parties well
for the past 45 years or so,’’ he
said.

The governor was asked if the
student convention should institute
super delegates such as the real
Democratic convention has.

‘*They’ll do just fine without my
advice,’’ Baliles said.

The governor did have advice
for any potential political candi-
dates. A candidate must learn to
listen extremely well.

‘Don’t get intoxicated by all the
nice things people say about you,”’
he said.

Mumps continues;

20 new cases reported
since Christmas break

 

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

Some students may be wondering
just how long W&L is going to have to
keep fighting its battle with the
mumps. Since October 1987, a mini-
epidemic of the disease has continued
to plague campus.

Dr. Robert M. Pickral reported that
there were 22 cases of the mumps be-
tween October and Christmas of last
year. Many of the students who were
infected with mumps have been pre-
viously immunized.

When Pickral called the epi-
demiology division of the State De-
partment of Health in early December
to obtain advice on immunizations for
the disease, they told him that they
wouldn’t currently recommend an
immunization for people who had
already been vaccinated once.

“In the event of an epidemic, 80
percent of the people will be protec
ted... [but] 20 percent may still be po
tentially infected,’’ said Pickral

‘IT can only conclude that the cases
we have seen are those 20 percent,”

he said.

Following the 22 cases last year, an
additional 20 cases have sprung up
since January at a rate of five to 10
new ones per month.

‘*Mumps is a viral illness, generally
a mild disease process,’’ Pickral ex-
plained. ‘‘Following acute infection,
someone can still shed viral [germs] in
oral secretions for weeks.”’

Pickral acknowledged that many
students were anxious about the pro-
longed spread of the disease, and
while the idea of having mumps im-
munizations for students on campus
was considered and attempted, the
State Department of Health denied
Pickral a recommendation.

‘*T personally recommend that those
who don’t have the vaccine, get it,”’
Pickral said. He suggested that those
who have been vaccinated should con-
tact a local physician at home during
spring break, if they feel uneasy about
contracting the disease

Pickral also would like to encourage
any students who have been treated
for the mumps this year outside of
school or who caught the disease at
home to notify the infirmary.

Delegates for the 1988 Mock Democratic Convention gather for Saturday’s voting session.

Robb says Democrats need
to represent the mainstream

 

By Sean Bugg

A former Virginia governor remin-
ded the Mock Democratic Convention
delegates Friday night that the 1988
convention is the first in which women
have participated as students of W&L,
and was greeted with a mixture of
boos and cheers.

“Consider it another step toward
realism and authenticity,’’ former
Gov. Charles Robb said in the open-
ing address of the second session of
the convention. at

“I am delighted to be. associated
again with this prestigious...event,”’
Robb said, though he expressed regret
that it was the second Democratic
convention he has spoken to at W&L.

“I doubt that all delegates are De-
mocrats,’’ he said jokingly. ‘‘I doubt
that all are of drinking age. I assume
those weren’t real cocktails you were
serving at the pre-convention par-
fies.””

Robb then reminded the audience
that it was a Democratic congress and
president that repealed prohibition.

“This promises more excitement
than any in recent history,’’ Robb said
of the current Democratic race with
five candidates still running, ‘‘or at
least breathing.’’

Robb asked the question, ‘‘What
should the Democrats say to the
American people during the upcoming
presidential campaign?”’

He said that the Democrats will not
regain the White House if their mes-
sage is rejected by the mainstream of
the United States.

“The old Democratic coalition has
withered,’’ he said. ‘‘A once-broad
agenda has appeared to have withered
into a series of independent litmus
tests for candidates.”’

Ex-Gov. Robb said he hopes the
Mock Convention will offer direc-
tion to the Democratic party and
the nation, in a press conference
following his opening address Fri-
day night in the second session of
the convention.

“*T want to see them offer a posi-
tive candidate to the party,’’ Robb
said.

The convention nominated Mas-
sachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
on the second roll call ballot in
Saturday’s session.

**T wouldn’t be at all surprised if
the nominee is the real nominee,”’
said Robb, who has endorsed Ten-
nessee Sen. Albert Gore. Gore was
chosen as the vice-presidential
nominee by the convention. When
asked if it was inevitable that Du-
kakis would be the nominee, Robb
said Dukakis ‘‘appears to be a co-
frontrunner at the moment.”’

Robb added, *‘I hope if he is the

Robb hopes that the super-
delegates at the National Democra-
tic Convention in Atlanta ‘‘act in
the best interest of the party.’’ He
said it was up to those delegates
whether or not to support tre lead-
ing candidate before the conven-
tion.

However, Robb said he does not
think the Democrats should nomi-
nate a non-candidate in the event of
a brokered convention.

‘| have never advocated looking
beyond the field of declared candi-
dates,’ he said. He added that
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
could ‘‘conceivably be drafted, but
it’s not likely.”

Robb said that the addition of
super-delegates to.the Mock Con-
vention might have added to the
authenticity, but it would have
been hard for the delegates to rep-
licate elected officials and such.

The convention ‘‘was probably a
more realistic convention without
the super-delegates.”’

Foreign journalists gathered
to discuss ‘The Race of ’88’

By Sean Bugg
Staff Reporter

Three ‘‘heavy-hitters’’ in the world
of journalism discussed the 1988 elec-
tion process last week as part of a
panel symposium held for foreign
journalists. The symposium was part
of the Mock Convention.

The members of the panel were Be-
tty Cole Dukert, producer of NBC
television’s Meet the Press; Clark R.
Mollenhoff, Pulitzer-prize winning
professor of journalism at W&L; and
Ken Tomlinson, executive editor and
vice president of Reader’s Digest.

The panel was headed by Bill An-
derson, director of the United States
Information Agency.

Journalists from nations including
France, Denmark, China and Saudi
Arabia attended the symposium, and
asked questions of the panelists about
the American election process.

The panelists were unanimous in
predicting Vice-President George
Bush as the Republican presidential
nominee. They also tentatively predic-
ted the Democratic candidate to be
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Duka-
kis, although all the panelists expres-
sed uncertainties about that nomina-
tion.

When asked what was happening in
the race Dukert said, ‘‘It is obvious
that television has expanded its role in
the primary campaign.’

Mollenhoff agreed, saying that in
the 1950s ‘‘it was"actually eee to

Change in Va. codes allow police
to require DUI blood tests for drugs

 

From Staff Reports

 

Beginning April 1, Virginia’s re-
vised law for driving under the in-
fluence gives police the authority to
require a blood test for drivers suspec-
ted of driving under the influence of
drugs other than alcohol. Drugs
covered by the law include illegal,
prescription and over-the-counter me-
dication.

‘*Driving under the influence of any
self-administered intoxicant is a threat
to highway safety,’* said Colonel R.L.
Suthard, Superintendent of State
Police. ‘*The revisions strengthen the
existing law covering alcohol and
drug-impaired drivers and will better
enable law enforcement to rid Virgin-
ia’s highways of drugged drivers.”’

The revised law allows police to
take a driver to a designated location
for a blood test, even if the driver has
already been tested for alcohol. Blood

ask a question and get a decent an-
swer....Now it’s absolutely impossi-
ble.”’ He attributes this problem to the
rise of the 30-second political com-
mercial.

**What you get is really an image,”
Mollenhoff said.

Dukert cited the public impression
made by the show of Robert Dole’s
anger in New Hampshire. Dole, upset
about the portrayal of his record in
political commercials, said in front of
a television camera, *‘Stop lying about
my record.”’

‘It was a terribly dramatic use of
television,’’ said Dukert.

“It was Bob Dole being Bob Dole,”’
said Mollenhoff.

The foreign correspondents asked
what the effects of polls were during
this primary season.

‘*T don’t think too many people look
to the polls to tell them [how to
vote],’’ said Dukert.

Regardless of what the polls might
say, Tomlinson said if the Democrats
could run a ‘‘master candidate, it
could be a real election.””

Polls are often contradictory,
Dukert pointed out, with people say-
ing they support two issues that are
diametrically opposed to one another.

‘They want all the good parts of
Reagan, and change,”’ she said.

On the possibility of a brokered
Democratic convention, Tomlinson
said it goes against common sense to
think that it would be brokered, but
the Democratic party has done surpr-
ising things in the past.

Dukert said the candidates will

samples will be sent to an office of the
Virginia Division of Consolidated
Laboratory where they will undergo a
general screening for alcohol and/or
other drugs.

If the blood test is positive for
drugs, the driver may be convicted of
driving under the influence of drugs,
Colonel Suthard said. First offense
penalties are the same as for driving
under the influence of alcohol, includ-
ing a fine of up to $1,000, a possible
jail sentence of up to one year, and a
possible license suspension. Repeat
offenders face much stiffer penalties.

‘*Statistics indicate that many drink-
ing drivers have also been using other
drugs,’’ said Donald E. Williams,
Commissioner of the Department of
Motor Vehicles. ‘‘Since there was no
legal blood test for law enforcement to
use prior to this law, there have been
few drugged driving convictions.

“In the last three years there were
two convictions for driving under the
influence of illegal drugs and seven

Tuesday but lost one of its best ath-
letes to a hamstring pull.

Freshman Carl Gilbert, the confer-
ence indoor champion in the long
jump and winner of the 400-meter run
in last week’s meet, pulled a hamstr-
ing while competing in the long jump.

Head coach Norris Aldridge said
that, while he will not know the extent
of the injury for a few days, Gilbert
may be unable to compete in any run-
ning events for the rest of the season.

But W&L won the meet even with-
out Gilbert, outscoring Bridgewater
83-62.

A week earlier, seniors Andrew
White and senior John White, junior
Jamie Urso and sophomore Wes Boyd
each won two events as W&L easily
defeated Eastern Mennonite and
Newport News Apprentice.

Against Bridgewater, Andrew
White again won two events, as did
senior Richard Moore. White won the
110-meter high hurdles in 15.8 sec-
onds and the 400 intermediate hurdles
in 59.2 seconds, and Moore took first

A weekend of tough tennis at
Swarthmore, Pa., netted the W&L
mens’ tennis team one win and one
loss. The Generals, ranked No. | in
the Division III polls, beat Swarth-
more, ranked No. 6, on Saturday, but
dropped a very close match to No. 2
Washington College on Sunday. The
split should almost assure the Gen-
erals of an invitation to this year’s
D-III National Championships to be
held here in Lexington.

Due to rainy conditions on Satur-
day, the Generals faced Swarthmore
on the Pennsylvania school’s indoor
courts. W&L senior David McLeod
said that this was ‘‘easier to play on
because there are no distractions
[from the game].”’

Although the final score may seem
to the contrary, the Generals needed

place in the 1500 (4:17.2) and the
5000 (16:30.4).

Also winning events for W&L were
Urso, who took the 800 in 2:03.2, and
sophomore pole vaulter Phil Samp-
son, who cleared 14 feet. The Gen-
erals also took first in both relays.

But W&L won the meet by picking
up key second-place points in 12 of
the day’s 17 events and by sweeping
four individual events and both relays.

Bridgewater led by two points with
only three events left, but W&L shut
out the Eagles the rest of the way to
pull off the victory and keep alive a
string of 30 straight dual-meet wins, a
streak that dates back to 1984.

Against Newport News Apprentice
and Eastern Mennonite, the Generals
dominated throughout, winning 13 of
the day’s 17 events and scoring 112
points. Newport News was a distant
second with 45 points, and Eastern
Mennonite finished third with 19
points.

Andrew White, a three-time Old
Dominion Athletic Conference runner
of the year, won the 110-meter high
hurdles in 15.6 seconds and the
400-meter intermediate hurdles in 58
seconds.

John White took first place in the
long jump (21-1/2) and triple jump
(39-9 1/2) and placed third in the 400

all the concentration they could mus-
ter. Five of the six singles matches
took three sets, as did one of the dou-
bles match-ups.

Junior Robert Haley, playing No. |
for the Generals, lost to Andy Mouer
in two close sets, 7-5, 6-4. Junior Bo-
bby Matthews won his first set against
Swarthmore’s Steve Tignor 6-3 at No.
2, but lost the second after three tie-
breaker points, 6-7 (3). Matthews ral-
lied to close out the match in the third
set, 6-3.

W&L’s No. 3. singles player,
McLeod, also had his hands full
against Lindsay Williams. After los-
ing the first set 6-7 (3), McLeod had
to force Williams to a fifth tie-breaker
point before winning 7-6 (5). Wil-
liams regained control of the match,
however, and won the third set 6-3.

Sophomore John Morris, playing
No. 4 for W&L, also lost his first set,
to Vivek Varma; 5-7. Morris returned
the favor in the second, winning 7-5,

Middlebury slips past

The W&L lacrosse team lost home
games Saturday and Wednesday, but
the 15-13 loss to 15th-ranked Middle-
bury showed the desire that the Gen-
erals lacked against Bowdoin four
days earlier, according to head coach
Dennis Daly.

‘‘We got beat against Bowdoin be-
cause we didn’t have the effort,”’ said
Daly, whose team has lost three in a
row. ‘‘Against Middlebury, we had
the effort, we just made some mis-
takes that lost the ball game for us.

‘‘We had a lot of kids that went out
there and played really hard,’’ he
said. ‘‘I’m not pleased with the out-
come, but I am pleased with the
effort.’’

Against 13th-ranked Bowdoin, a
17-11 loss, the Generals had to con-
tend with more than just the Polar
Bears. The game was marred by bad
weather—thunder and lightning that
forced a 40-minute stoppage of play
mid-way through the first quarter.

Down 1-0, W&L sophomore mid-
fielder Chris Mastrogiovanni scored
twice in less than two minutes to give
the Generals a 2-1 lead, but the Bears
answered back with three straight
goals to take away the only W&L lead
of the day.

Goals by senior middie Robbie
Stanton and senior attackman Peter
Smith tied the game at four at the end
of the first quarter, but the Polar Bears
responded with two goals early in the
second.

W&L sophomore attackman Chris
Giblin tied the game with two straight
scores. The Bears scored twice to
again take a two-goal lead, but junior

attackman John Ware pulled the Gen-
erals within one, 8-7, when he scored
the last goal of the first half.

In the third quarter, Bowdoin went
on a 3-1 run early to take an 11-8 lead
and scored again later in the period.
But the Generals hung close, scoring
three times in the third period and
once early in the fourth to stay within
one.

The Bears were too much for W&L
in the fourth quarter, however, scor-
ing twice to go up 15-11 with less than
five minutes left and then getting two
insurance goals late to nail down the
win.

Things went a little better for W&L
against Middlebury, and the Generals
went on two three-goal scoring runs to
keep the game close.

The key to W&L’s good play in the
first three quarters was senior goalie
Paul Burke, who made 13 saves and
key outlet passes to get the W&L tran-
sition game going.

‘“‘Anytime the goalie makes the
saves, you get transition,”’ said Daly.
‘*Burke gave us the best goal-tending
performance of the season.”’

But, despite the effort, W&L never
led the Panthers and was shut out in
the fourth quarter, giving the Generals
their fifth loss in seven games.

W&L again fell behind early, 1-0,
but tied the game at the 4:11 mark
with an unassisted goal by Stanton.

But the Panthers scored four
straight before the Generals answered
with an extra-man goal by senior mid-
fielder Sandy Harrison to make the
score 5-2 at the end of the first quar-
ter.

Middlebury regained a four-goal
lead early in the second period with its
own extra-man goal, but W&L shut
out the Panthers over the next 11

hurdles (1:02) while Boyd won the
100 meters in 11.6 seconds and the
200 in 24.2 seconds.

In the distance events, Urso took
first place in the 800 (2:07) and the
1500 (4: 18.6), and Moore placed sec-
ond in both events. Freshman David
Martin won the 5000 (16:33. 1).

The Generals took all four places in
the 400, with Gilbert first (52.6) and
junior Scott Williams a close second
(53.2).

Checking the field events, the Gen-
erals swept the pole vault. Freshman
David Johnston cleared 13 feet to take
first place and senior Robert William-
son finished second at 12-6.

Senior Sean Connolly won the jave-
lin with a throw of just over 163 feet,
and junior Fray McCormick won the
high jump by clearing six feet.

Other scorers for W&L in the field
events included Gilbert, who placed
second in the long and triple jumps,
and senior Norm Sigler, who took
third in the triple jump.

and shut the door on Varma in the
third, taking him 6-1. Senior co-
captain Chris Wiman, W&L’s No. 5
player, beat Tom Cantine 6-2 in the
first set, but slipped in the second, los-
ing 5-7. Wiman returned to form in
the third set, clinching 6-2.

Freshman Bill Meadows, in the No.
6 position for the Generals, dropped
his first set to Steve Sell 3-6, but bat-
tled back to win 6-1, 6-2 and take the
match.

The Generals had come out ahead
4-2 after the highly competitive sin-
gles action. Swarthmore did not fade a
bit in doubles, as W&L had its hands
full again.

Matthews and McLeod, the Gen-
erals’ No. 1 combination, needed
extra games to oust Mouer and Andy
Dailey in two sets, 7-5, 7-5. The No.
2 pair of Morris and Wiman had a
little better luck against Varma and
Cantine, winning 6-4, 6-4.

Big weekend results in two-match split for netters

Meadows were last off the courts,
needing three sets to beat Tignor and
James Stanley 7-6 (0), 6-7 (4), 6-4.
W&L had won the team battle 7-2, a
somewhat deceptive score.

Skies cleared enough on Sunday fo
allow outdoor play, but the weather
was cold and windy for the Generals
match against Washington College.
The play of the two teams would soon
make one forget the weather, though,
ad the two teams would finish the sin-
gles tied at 3-3.

Haley lost to Larry Gewer 6-1, 6-4
while Matthews countered by beating
Scott Flippin-Read in two, 6-1, 6-2.

McLeod needed three sets to take
Claudio Gonzales 5-7, 6-2, 6-2. Mor-
ris suffered only his second singles
loss of the season, falling to David
Marshall 7-5, 6-3.

Wiman needed four tie-breaker
points to beat Rich Phoebus in the first
set 7-6 (4). Wiman controlled Mar-
shall in the second, winning “tt 6-4, to

 

 

minutes and scored three times to cut
the margin to one, 6-5.

After a Middlebury goal put the
Panthers up by two, Stanton scored
his second goal of the day just as a
W&L power play ended to make the
score 7-6,

Middlebury scored three of the next
four goals to take a 10-7 lead. The run
was interrupted only by a Ware goal at
the 4:39 mark, the junior attackman’s
first score of the day.

The Generals continued to hang on,
however, as Mastrogiovanni and Gi-
blin both scored to trim the Panther’s
lead to one once again.

But the Panthers again prevented

the tie, scoring twice to go up 12-9 at
the 10-minute mark of the third quar-
ter.

Finally, the W&L offense was able
to put on a game-tying run. Two more
Mastrogiovanni goals cut the margin
to one, and Ware scored on a pass
from Harrison to make the score
12-all at the end the third quarter.

The tie was the best W&L could do,
however, as the Panthers dominated
the fourth quarter, scoring three goals
and allowing only one.

Looking ahead, the Generals will
stay in Lexington over spring break to
prepare for a game on April 16 against
Hampden- Sydney.

Baseball drops to 2-6 in ODAC with a 1-2 week

 

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L baseball team lost its
second game to Bridgewater yesterday
afternoon. With a loss to Lynchburg
last Thursday and a win over Emory
and Henry on Saturday, the Generals’

record now stands at 4-7, 2-6 in the

Old Dominion Athletic Conference.
Junior Chris Cunningham took to
the mound at the top of the first inning
yesterday and pitched a very solid
game through the top of the fourth,
when he was relieved by senior Carter

Steuart. Cunningham gave up a couple
of runs in those first innings, but two
RBI from freshman Tim Wheeler and
junior Tom Skeen tied it up at 2-2 until
the sixth inning.

Steuart had a pretty sharp day on the
mound as well, but with a couple of
errors and a key hit, Bridgewater put
two more runs on the board in the
sixth. After a hit and a walk in the
eighth, Steuart was relieved by junior
Mike Temple, who then proceeded to
give up two runs on a double before
stranding an Eagle in scoring position.

In the top of the ninth, Bridgewater
put two men on before ripping one

down the first base line. The long
throw to third was off target, and the
Eagles had three more runs. Nothing
much happened for the Generals in the
bottom on the ninth, and Bridgewater
went home with a 9-2 win.

Head coach Jeff Stickley was dis-
appointed, mainly with the second
half of the game. ‘*We didn’t get peo-
ple on base after the fourth or fifth in-
ning, and that was the main differen-
ce. The game was really neck and
neck throughout most of the innings,”’
he said.

Last Thursday, the Generals fell 6-3
to Lynchburg in Lexington. Cunni-

ngham was the losing pitcher but gave
up only three earned runs and a walk.
W&L drove in one run in the seventh
and two in the eighth, but it wasn’t
enough to overtake Lynchburg.

On Saturday, W&L earned a 2-0
victory over Emory and Henry in the
first game of a scheduled double-
header. Senior Eric Acra gave up only
four hits in five innings before rain
brought the game to a close, and can-
celled the second game.

The Generals take a break for
exams but will resume the season on
April 10 when they travel to Mary
Washington.

clinch his match. Meadows, however,
lost to Peter Maller 6-4, 6-2, leaving
the doubles competition to decide the
match.

Washington College captured one
doubles win quickly, beating Haley
and Meadows 6-0, 6-4. W&L’s pair
of Wiman and Morris responded by
beating Maller and Phoebus 6-4, 7-6
(6).

Suddenly the No. 1 W&L duo of
Matthews and McLeod found them-
selves alone on the blustery courts,
playing a tie-breaking third set against
Gewer and Flippin-Read. The W&L
pair had won the first set 6-2, but the
duo from Washington College rallied
hard, winning the second set 6-1.

Matthews and McLeod got into
trouble early in the third set, giving
Gewer and Flippin-Read the first three
games. The Generals fought back, but
fell short 6-3. ‘‘We shouldn’t have

lost them,’’ said McLeod, ‘‘but we
spotted them those three quick
games.”’

This time the score reflected the
closeness of the match, with Washing-
ton College coming away with a 5-4
win.

W&L played host to Virginia Mili-
tary Institute on Tuesday in what is
light-heartedly referred to as_ the
Rockbridge County Collegiate Cham-
pionships. The Generals, with several
changes in their singles line-up, came
out wearing the crown, sweeping the
meeting 9-0. Unlike the week-end
matches, straights sets were the rule
not the exception against the Keydets.

The team will spend its spring break
in Florida, but instead of lying on the
beach and playing in the ocean, the
Generals will be playing several tough
teams including Stetson, North Flor-
ida and Rollins.

Women extend win
streak to six straight

 

By Amy Packard

The W&L women’s tennis team
continued its winning streak with vic-
tories in its last four matches. The
team, which has won six straight,
played a demanding schedule of four
matches in six days, and each oppo-
nent was regarded as a challenge.

Friday, Generals defeated Ran-
dolph-Macon Women’s College 7-2
on the road. Monday, W&L competed
against Sweet Briar College. The final
was again 7-2, with losses for the
Generals only in No. 3 singles and
No. 1 doubles. Head coach William
Washburn considered the _ perfor-
mance of W&L to be ‘‘exceptionally
good,’’ against a strong Sweet Briar
team. He especially noted W&L’s
‘*good team unity.””

The match on Tuesday was even
more commendable. The Generals
took on the Division I team from Vir-
ginia Commonwealth and _ finished
with a 6-3 victory. All three losses
were uncharacteristic. Freshmen Jean
Stroman and Kelly Martone, the No. |
and 2 singles players respectively,
were defeated in competitive matches.
The No. 3 doubles team of junior

Martha Christian and sophomore
Laura Eggers, also suffered a surpris-
ing loss.

Yesterday’s match was what Wash-
burn called a ‘‘cliff- hanger.’”’ W&L
won 5-2 after taking a 4-2 lead after
the singles competition. Stroman lost
in three sets in a ‘‘beautifully played
game,’’ according to Washburn, who
attributes the defeat to fatigue from
the tough schedule and Stroman’s par-
ticularly challenging opponents.

In doubles, the No, 2 team of Mar-
tone and freshman Shawn Wert won,
but the match with Christian and Eg-
gers was called for rain. At No. |
doubles, Stroman played with Teresa
Southard, who was filling in for the
No. 3 singles player, freshman Kathy
Leake. Leake missed the last two mat-
ches because of tendonitis. The pair
was behind 2-3 when rain cancelled
their match as well.

Washburn is very aware of the toll
that the three consecutive matches
took on the Generals, and regards
their performance as even more ap-
plaudable under the circumstances.

‘I’m proud of their courage and
devotion which came through with the
wins,’’ he said. The team will play
matches against Centre, Armstrong
and Emory and Henry during spring
break.

Linksters score ‘best win’

After struggling in its first two invi-
tationals, the W&L golf team reboun-
ded last week by putting together three
consecutive team rounds of 320 or
under.

The Generals won their first dual
match of the year last Thursday in
Lexington, defeating Shenandoah
319-392. Sophomore Ted Fox was the
medalist with a 76 on the Lexington
Golf and Country Club’s par 71
course. Junior Tom Wingfield and
senior Kevin Hunt shot 79s.

Friday was another strong round,
with the Generals posting a second-
place finish in an Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference round robin, again in
Lexington. Randolph-Macon won the
match with a 316 score, followed by
W&L (317), Hampden-Sydney (318)
and Bridgewater (334). Senior Gary
Campbell led W&L with a 77 while
senior James Sowersby added a 79.

Sowersby would come through in
the clutch for the Generals on Monday

in a dual meet against Longwood and
Radford. Coming in last off the Lex-
ington course, Sowersby scored a 76
to help W&L edge Radford 317-319.
Longwood was well off the pace with
a 352.

‘*That was the best win we've had
for some time,’’ said head coach Buck
Leslie. ‘‘We were behind Radford un-
til [Sowersby]came in. In fact, Rad-
ford thought they had us beat.”’

Fox and Wingfield shot 80s for the
Generals to go along with Sowersby’s
heroics.

The Generals will now have almost
two weeks off before their next com-
petitive round, tentatively scheduled
for April 12 at Bridgewater. W&E
will then travel for a dual meet with
Shenandoah on April 13, with possi
bly a trip to Washington, D.C. te
compete in a Georgetown tournament:

“‘This is a frustrating time of the
year,’’ said Leslie. ‘‘We played five
rounds in seven days—competitive
rounds—and we are starting to get
some consistency. Now, we have to
stop.”

And

And the winner is... Well, we don’t
know yet, but with the Academy
Awards just two short weeks away
you can bet someone is sweating it
out. To be exact; ten actors, ten ac-
tresses, ten directors, ten writers, all
kinds of behind the scenes people and
every major film company on the five
major continents are all sweating it out
waiting to see which one of them will
take home the most coveted prizes in
the world of motion pictures.

On April Il, as is the custom
around this time of year, anyone who
is anyone in the world of entertain-
ment will gather to honor the year’s
finest achievements in film at the
Academy Awards ceremony. This
year’s 60th annual awards ceremony
promises to be an evening of incredi-
ble extravagance, thrilling surprises,
chilling disappointments and long,
boring acceptance speeches. But hey,
if you won, you'd thank everyone you
had ever met too, right? Sure.

This year’s nominations even have
some interesting twists to them. In
1973, Bernardo Bertolucci received a
Best Director nomination for Last
Tango in Paris (he lost to George Roy
Hill who won for The Sting), Jack Ni-
cholson received a Best Actor nomina-
tion for The Last Detail (he lost to
Jack Lemmon who won for Save the
Tiger) and Vincent Gardenia received
a Best Supporting Actor nomination
for Bang the Drum Slowly (he lost to
John Houseman who won for The
Paper Chase). Now the ballot for
1988 again finds Bertolucci nominated
for Best Director, Nicholson nomi-
nated for Best Actor and Gardenia
nominated for Best Supporting Actor.
Who knows, maybe this will be their
year,

In addition, this is the first year in
the 59-year history of the awards that
an American director has not been
nominated for the Best Director
award. But enough about the nomina-
tions. Who really cares? All anyone is
really interested in is who wins, right?
Right.

So, without further ado, here are the
official Tug’s Tag Academy Award
predictions for 1988.

Best Picture
The nominees are: Broadcast News,
Fatal Attraction, Hope and Glory, The

the wi

Last Emperor and Moonstruck.

This year’s best picture race is going
to come down to Broadcast News and
The Last Emperor. Fatal Attraction,
Hope and Glory and Moonstruck were
all excellent films but they won’t win.
Broadcast News is probably the most
entertaining film nominated and is in-
credibly well acted but the Academy
tends to give the Oscar to a historical
film if it can. I hate to say the Acad-
emy is tight, but if we fed them coal
they would... Well, you know the
rest.

Tugs Tag: The Last Emperor

Best Actor
The nominees are: Michael Douglas
(Wall Street), William Hurt

(Broadcast News), Marcello Mas-
troianni (Dark Eyes), Jack Nicholson
(/ronweed) and Robin Williams (Good
Morning, Vietnam).

Like many of this year’s races the Best
Actor competition is going to be close,
but ultimately it’s going to come down
to Michael Douglas and William Hurt.
Douglas’ performance as Gordon Ge-
kko in Wail Street was the most capti-
vating and well-done of his career.
The acceptance of Fatal Attraction by
the Academy and his strong perfor-
mance in that film will also help pave
the way for his first Oscar. Hurt is try-
ing for his second Oscar in three tries
having won for Kiss of the Spider
Woman in 1984, and losing last year
to shoe-in Paul Newman who finally
won for The Color of Money after sev-
en nominations, but will fall short
again.

Tug’s Tag: Michael Douglas (Wall
Street)

Best Actress

The nominees are: Cher
(Moonstruck), Glenn Close (Fatal At-
traction), Holly Hunter (Broadcast
News), Sally Kirkland (Anna) and
Meryl Streep (/ronweed).

Early in the Oscar season everyone
was saying that it was the year of
Holly Hunter. Her performance in
Broadcast News is definitely an Os-
car-caliber performance but winning
will be no easy task. Like Michael
Douglas, Glenn Close may ride the
Fatal Attraction wave of enthusiasm
all the way to golden shores. There is
no question that her performance is
the best of her career and one of the
two best of the year but I don’t think
she’ll have quite enough to beat Holly
Hunter’s cuteness. Cher has been get-
ting all kinds of hype lately, but she
wasn’t good enough to win. The only
way she can win is with a sympathy

vote, but I don’t think she'll get it.

News

Best Supporting Actor

The nominees are: Albert Brooks
(Broadcast News), Sean Connery (The
Untouchables), Morgan Freeman
(Street Smart), Vincent Gardenia
(Moonstruck) and Denzel Washington
(Cry Freedom).

This race won't even be close. If
there’s a God, Albert Brooks will take
home the Oscar for Best Supporting
Actor. Brooks’ command of his part
was so incredible that the critics ha-
ven't even given the other nominees a
chance of winning. There is no ques-
tion about this one.
Tug’s Tag: Albert

Brooks

Best Supporting Actress
The nominees are: Norma Aleandro
(Gaby—A True Story), Anne Archer
(Fatal Attraction), Olympia Dukakis
(Moonstruck), Anne Ramsey (Throw
Momma From the Train) and Ann
Sothern (The Whales of August).
In the category of Ann(e)s it will be an
Olympia who will be the champion.
Anne Archer’s performance as the
‘“You come near my family again and
Pll kill you’’ mother in Fatal Attrac-
tion and Anne Ramsey’s performance
as Danny DeVito’s momma in Throw
Momma From the Train were both
excellent performances but the award
will go to Olympia Dukakis for her
wonderful performance as Cher’s lov-
ing mother and Vincent Gardenia’s
ever forgiving wife in Moonstruck. It
looks like there may be two winners in
the family after all.
Tug’s Tag: Olympia Dukakis
(Moonstruck)

Best Director

The nominees are: Bernardo Bertolu-
cci (The Last Emperor), John Boor-
man (Hope and Glory), Lasse Hall-
strom (My Life as a Dog), Norman
Jewison (Moonstruck) and Adrian
Lyne (Fatal Attraction)

From this group have come some of
the best and the most controversial
films in the history of motion pictures.
Last Tango in Paris (Bertolucci), A
Soldier’s Story, Fiddler on the Roof,
In the Heat of the Night (Jewison)
Flashdance and 9 1/2 Weeks (Lyne)
have all made their marks on the sex-
ual, religious and ethnic barriers of
Hollywood. This year all five direc-
tors deserve an award, but only one
can win. Since the first Academy

awards for Best Director and Best Pic-
ture have coincided 44 of 59 times and
15 of 17 times since 1970. This year
will be no exception.

Tug’s Tag: Bernardo Bertolucci
(The Last Emperor)

Other Oscar nominees to watch:

* Original Screenplay: James L.
Brooks (Broadcast News) — If he can
get by Woody Allen’s Radio Days,
James Brooks should win.

* Adapted Screenplay: Mark Pe-
ploe and Bernardo Bertolucci (The
Last Emperor) — This category will
be close but if Bertolucci can carry
Best Director and Best Picture, he’ll
probably win here.

* Foreign Film: Au Revoir les En-
fants (France) — This is a shoe-in!

x Original Song: (I’ve Had) The
Time of My Life (Dirty Dancing) — It
has already won the Golden Globe for
Best Song. It should win the Oscar as
well.

* Cinematography: Vittorio Stor-
aro (The Last Emperor) — This award
will most likely follow the Best Pic-
ture. If Storaro doesn’t win, Michael
Ballhaus will win for Broadcast News.

* Makeup: Rick Baker (Harry and
the Hendersons) — Baker is the per-
ennial favorite and should win again.

* Visual Effects: Innerspace —
The travel scenes inside the human
body in this updated remake of Fan-
tastic Voyage were absolutely incredi-

Two W&L Seniors market the world

 

By Dana Bolden

**People can make a political state-
ment, hail their ethnic heritage or just
wear them for the colors,’’ said senior
Ted Myers about his product.

Students may have noticed a small
ad in a recent issue of Rolling Stone
for ‘‘Peace Frogs,’’ the baggy shorts
with the flag of just about any country
you could think of on them.

What many may not know is that the
retailers of the Peace Frog design are
two of W&L’s own, seniors Ted
Myers and Victor Vesely.

Myers bought a percentage of the
company when he met the UVa. gra-
duate who started the idea. Now that
Myers owns a percentage of the com-
pany, he and Vesely have joined
together to retail the items in the U.S.
and Canada.

According to the pair, the name
“Peace Frogs’’ came from a Doors’
song with that same title. The shorts
are ‘‘a glimmer of hope in this restless
planet of ours, where terrorism and
political unbalance abound,”’ said the
two students.

The ad first appeared in an issue of
Rolling Stone last April and, accord-
ing to Myers, was followed by some
problems.

Myers said the long distance com-
pany did not hook up their line until 10
days after the ad appeared in the
magazine. The line was not connected
until one of Myers’s friend’s father,
who works with the FCC, called the
company and ‘‘got the ball rolling.”’

Myers said the day the line was
connected, they received nearly 80
orders for the shorts. Calls came from
all over the United States, Canada, the
Caribbean and even West Germany.

Vesely is planning to introduce the
product in Canada this summer.

**T think it will be a big hit,”’ said
Vesely.

He hopes that ‘‘Peace Frogs’’ will
soon take the place of the ‘‘Jams’’ that
are currently on the market. The pro-
duct has been introduced at trade
shows in Virginia, California and
New York.

*‘We just sold 12 dozen to a chain of
surf shops in New Jersey and are
about to introduce them to the W&L
community,’’ said Myers.

Vesely said he was afraid people

wouldn’t buy them because they might

be too trendy, but after thinking about
it he said that each individual pair of
shorts is unique because of the diverse

selection thev offer.
The shorts are rather baggy, made

of 100 percent cotton and bear a rep-
lica of the flag of just about any coun-
try you could possibly imagine.
While most of the shorts are almost
identical to the flags of the countries
they resemble, the pattern of the
shorts does put some limitations on the
design. Vesely points out, however,
all of the colors of the flags are on the
shorts.

“*Peace Frogs’’ cannot display the
American flag on their shorts because
it is illegal to sit on the U.S. flag.

The shorts come with a disclaimer
indicating that the shorts are not in-
tended to offend anyone, buy Myers
said some people have taken offense.
‘*There were some Islamic people
who got upset when they saw we were
selling shorts with the Saudi Arabian
flag,’’ said Myers.

Among the biggest sellers for this
year are the Soviet Union, Australian,
Jamaican and Ethiopian shorts. They
did sell many Irish shorts for St.

Patrick’s day, as well. Another popu-
lar style is the reversible Iraq/Iran
short. He said the communist country
shorts are quite popular on the VMI

campus.

Both Myers and Vesely agree that
the best part of selling the shorts is
watching the people decide which
ones they want.

‘Some people come and pick
through the shorts for at least 20
minutes before they decide because of
the number of flags that we have,’’
said Vesely.

Last year’s shorts were not as de-
tailed as those offered this year. ‘‘We
tried to improve quality and silk
screening this year,’’ said Myers, ‘‘I
think our most intricate design is on
the Austrian shorts.”’

If you order from Rolling Stone, it
will take 4-6 weeks for your order to
arrive. Myers said if you order from
them you can either pick your shorts
from available supplies or receive
your shorts in about 2 weeks.

The shorts sell for $24 and to make
your ‘‘Peace Frogs’’ wardrobe com-
plete, you can also buy shirts and pull-
overs from the pair. You can reach
Vesely at 463-6956 or Myers at
463-4729 for orders or information.

Next year’s Rush Calendar
defers pledgeship until Jan.

By David Emrich
Co-Editor

The 1988 Rush Calendar that was
distributed at Tuesday’s Interfraterni-
ty Council meeting contained three
major revisions in rules governing
fraternity pledge programs.

First, according to the new calen-
dar, no fraternity will be allowed to
begin its pledge program until the first
week of winter term.

According to the calendar, for the
entire fall term the ‘‘new members
will be social members only with no
obligations other than financial and
house cleanups on the weekends in
which as many actives as new mem-
bers participate.’’ Second, the new
members of a fraternity will also be
subject to a minimum GPA require-
ment of 1.9. No new member will be
allowed to begin a pledge education
program unless he fulfills the mini-
mum GPA requirement.

According to IFC President Ross
Singletary, any new member that does
not meet the minimum GPA require-
ment will remain a social member of
the fraternity until the next pledge
training program begins.

He says there are no rules against a
social member of a fraternity living in
the fraternity house nor are there any
plans to make a rule prohibiting social
members from living in the fraternity
house.

Third, no pledge program may last
longer than ten weeks. The calendar
expressly stipulates ‘‘initiation must
occur by the end of the tenth week of
[winter term].”’

Susan Stamberg, the first woman to
anchor a nightly news program in the
United States, gave the second Eli-
zabeth Lewis Otey Lecture Monday in
Lee Chapel.

Stamberg, who was a co-host of

\ National Public Radio’s ‘‘All Things
Considered’’ for 14 years and curren-
tly is host of NPR’s ‘‘Weekend Edi-
tion,’’ spoke on variety of topics in-
cluding responsible reporting and the
role of women in journalism.

Comparing two recent films on
journalists, Broadcast News and Good
Morning, Vietnam, Stamberg said she
thinks that the disc jockey character in
Good Morning, Vietnam was more re-
sponsible journalist ‘‘because the
radio disc jockey took his listeners so
seriously.’’

Robin Williams’ character did his
job and served his listener ‘‘by giving
them a chance to relax, even for 20

In Broadcast News, the female pro-
ducer becomes angry when she dis-
covers that William Hurt’s character
has faked tears for reaction shot in a
particular story.

Stamberg calls this ‘‘Hollywood
hairsplitting,’’ saying that the incident
is no different from ‘‘cutaway’’ reac-
tion shots of reporters nodding or
smiling. These shots are routinely fil-
med after the interview has been com-
pleted, she said.

The female producer was worthy of
criticism because she was willing to be
a puppeteer for Hurt’s character, she
said. The producer talked the unpre;
pared reporter through a difficult
interview by whispering information
to him through a headpiece.

‘*William Hurts are everywhere,
especially in local news,’’ said Stam-
berg, ‘‘but we will always eventually
turn to the Robin Williams’s.”’

Stamberg said she takes the accur-
acy of her reports very seriously.
NPR’s policy is to never splice a reph-
rased question into an interview. All
questions must be restated in front of
the guest. Reporters cannot use a re-
corded sound to make it seem as
though the reporter is somewhere she
isn’t.

Stamberg said it is sometimes diffi-
cult to adhere so strictly to the rules.
In one instance, she was doing a story
on Africa. She wanted to use the
sounds of insects in the background,
but the only recording she had were of
insects in Nicaragua. She decided to
tell the listener where the sounds came
from, and then asked them imagine
they were in Africa.

Stamberg said accuracy of the in-
sects may seem to be a trivial point,
but she said it is necessary that journa-
lists keep the listeners’ trust.

‘*We must maintain that contract be-
tween you and us. We must tell you

Stamberg said that she also, ‘‘as a
matter of practice,’’ turns off her tape
recorder when a guest that is being

interviewed breaks into tears. She al-
lows the guest to regain his composure
before continuing.

At many television and radio
stations, footage of someone crying is
considered ‘‘hot tape,’’ she said.

“*We must never lose sight of the
fact that the news happens to and is
caused by people,’’ said Stamberg,
“It’s people shedding those tears.’’

Too often, the tears, rather than the
cause of the tears, become the story,
she said.

Some of Stamberg’s more con-
troversial statements came during her
discussion of the role of women in
journalism.

Women journalists tend to be more
sympathetic listeners, to ask more
questions and double check their facts,
and have a greater tendency to be or-
ganized, she said.

Because of these attributes, ‘‘by the
simple notion of presence, women af-
fect the stories that get covered and
the way they are covered.”’

She said that women in journalism
are often in a ‘‘catch- 22’’ situation
when they answer the question ‘‘Does
gender affect performance?”’

If women say no, Stamberg said

they are not being accurate or real-

changes in the pledge programs there
are several other differences between

last year’s calendar and this year’s.

Last year contact of any kind was
forbidden at all but a few periods de-
signated as contact periods. This led
to some problems as fraternity mem-
bers were not allowed to speak to
freshmen they happened to meet on

the hill.
This year,

mitted on campus.”’

According to Singletary, ‘‘the pre-

vious rules were impractical.’’

The number of informal contact
periods in this year’s rush calendar
has increased. Singletary said the IFC
thought there wasn’t enough casual

contact in last year’s calendar.

According to the calendar, ‘during
Orientation Week, September 4-9, ca-

sual contact is permitted on campus.
No freshman may be in fraternity
houses or at events anywhere spon-
sored by or for fraternities.

‘‘During the period prior to formal
rush, September 10-15, freshmen may
visit fraternity houses between noon
and 8:00 p.m. on Sunday through
Thursday. On Saturday, September 10
and at all other parties during Rush,
freshmen may attend.”’

As with last year’s rush, all Rush
functions are BYOB.

According to the Calendar,
‘‘Fraternities are expressly forbidden
to serve or provide alcohol at any of
these events to freshmen or upper-
classmen. Anyone who chooses to
drink must provide his own alcohol.”’

Singletary said because this year’s

Early Sunday morning, for the sec-
ond time in five weeks, unidentified
shots were fired in Lexington, accord-
ing to Lexington Chief of Police
Bruce M. Beard.

Beard said the most recent incident
occurred at 12:35 a.m. last Sunday.
He said Officer Phillip Joines had
stopped a car for a traffic violation on
Lechter Avenue when Joines heard
two shots in the vicinity of the corral.
Beard said several moments passed
and then Joines heard two more shots.

‘*We’ve thought we’ve heard shots
in Lexington before and they’ve
turned out to be firecrackers but this
officer [Joines] is well trained in
firearms and was able to identify them
as gunshots,’’ said Beard.

Beard said the incident is still under
investigation.

On Tuesday night Beard spoke to
the InterFraternity Council and asked
for cooperation from the fraternities in
the matter.

“I’m not pointing fingers at any
student or any fraternity,’’ said Beard.
‘I’m just asking for your cooperation.

“If any member of your fraternity

“from the arrival of
freshmen ... in Lexington casual con-
tact with [fraternity] members is per-

Rush is so much different from any in
the past the IFC wants to make sure
the freshmen understand their rights
and obligations under the new rules.

Toward the end of educating the
freshmen the new calendar incorpor-
ates two formal meetings into the rush
schedule. One on Sept. 16, before
Rush starts, and the second on Sept.
26, after rush ends.

In other business; Tuesday's meet-
ing was the first for the new IFC Judi-
cial Board. Taking office at the meet-
ing were Singletary as President, Jeff
Kelsey as Vice-President, John Roach
as Treasurer, Chris Willard as Secre-
tary, lan Thompson as Senior Justice,
David Gildea as one Junior Justice,
Hunt Niedringaus as the second Junior
Justice, and Frank Cannapel as the
Public Relations Chairman.

Singletary said the Judicial Board
would appoint Rush Book Editors at
next Tuesday’s meeting.

The IFC has set a tentative schedule
for Greek Week, to be held April
27-30.

According to Singletary, on Wed-
nesday, April 27, in the afternoon
there will be a volleyball competition
for fraternities. That evening at 6:30
p.m. a live band will play on the Co-
lonnade. Singletary said the band had
not yet been determined.

On Thursday, April 28, Singletary
said a soccer competition will be held.
On Friday, April 29, the fraternities
will compete in an ultimate frisbee
competition.

Singletary said the finals of all three
competitions would be held on Satur-
day, April 30, just before the Lee-
Jackson Lacrosse Classic.

them recklessly I ask that you take the

“‘T think that you, as house presi-
dents, have the authority to take the
firearms from them.”’

Associate Dean of Students Leroy
C. Atkins said that under the new
Washington and Lee Standards for
Fraternities no fraternity member may
keep a gun ina fraternity house.

He said if anyone has a gun in a
fraternity house then it must be re-
moved from tne house and stored
either in someone’s apartment or with
university proctor Charles F.
“*Murph’’ Murray.

Five weeks ago two Lexington
Police officers, Warren Kutz and
James Ruley, were travelling south on
Jefferson St. when police believe the
front window on the passenger side of
their car was shattered by a bullet.

Neither officer was injured in the
incident.

According to Beard, the police
found a spent cartridge from a
.300-caliber magnum near where the
car was hit but did not find the slug.

Beard said some of the lab reports
on the first incident have come back
but he is waiting for the rest to come
back before he makes a statement.

From Staff Reports

 

The college recruiting picture for
1987-88 continues to look bright, if
average salary offers are an indica-
tion. According to data compiled by
the College Placement Council (CPC)
for its second Salary Survey report of
the season, most disciplines that
showed salary increases in January
posted even further gains as of March.

Salary offers for accounting gra-
duates took another jump to an aver-
age of $23,700 a year—now 9 percent
higher than last July. The dollar aver-
age for graduates in marketing and
distribution rose 2.7 percent since
July, to $20,904. In banking/finance
and human resources, two business
categories added to the report this
year, salary offers were about the
same as January. Banking/finance
graduates average $21,792, while

human resource graduates averaged
$19,212.

In January, petroleum engineers
made a comeback in terms of salary.
This trend continued into March, with
the dollar average rising to $33,840, a
9.8 percent gain since July. This boost
is coupled with a significant turnar-
ound in the number of job offers to
petroleum engineers—up 36 percent
compared with last year at this time.

Mechanical, electrical, and chemi-
cal engineers also experienced in-
creases in salary offers. The average
for mechanical engineers climbed 3.8
percent since July to $29,388, while
the average for electrical engineers
went up 1.4 percent to $29,316. The
dollar average for chemical engineers
rose to $30,768—a 3.1 percent in-
crease over July’s figure.

The allied health field is holding
steady. Dollar offers ranged from
$19,440 to $30,000 with an average of
$24,660—about the same as in Jan-

uary. Salary offers for nurses fell
slightly since January. In this latest
report, they ranged from $18,996 to
$28,368 and averaged $23,604.

Computer science graduates gar-
nered slightly higher dollar offers than
last July for an average of $26,676.
However, the number of job offers ex-
tended to this group decreased 2 per-
cent since last year at this time. Salary
offers for computer programmers
ranged from $20,064 to $30,492 and
averaged $25,944, a little higher than
in July.

Of all job offers made to bachelor’ s-
degree holders, 53 percent went to
nontechnical graduates while 47 per-
cent were extended to technical gra-
duates. Public accounting employers
made the most offers to nontechnical
graduates (45 percent). Their average
salary offer to these graduates was
$24,024. The aerospace industry con-
tinued to provide the greatest concen-
tration of job offers to technical gra

duates (16.5 percent), at an average
pay of $29,280.

The outlook for MBA graduates is
still optimistic. Only inexperienced
MBA candidates with nontechnical
undergraduate degrees encountered a
drop in salary offers—4.4 percent
since last July to $30,480. On the
brighter side, experienced MBA gra-
duates with nontechnical degrees
received higher salary offers. Inexper-
ienced MBA graduates with technical
undergraduate degrees reaped 8.4
percent higher dollar averages com-
pared with last July. Experienced gra-
duates with technical degrees were
offered substantially higher salaries as
well. The greatest concentration of sa-
lary offers to MBA’s came from pub-
lic accounting employers.

In addition to the current published
report, salaries by job location are be-

Members of the W&L community
will have the opportunity to learn
more about blood pressure,
cholesterol levels, and nutrition dur-
ing a three-day Health Awareness Fes-
tival April 27- 29. The festival is be-
ing held in conjunction with the Amer-
ican Heart Association.

‘The purpose of our festival is to
educate members of the W&L com-
munity—students, faculty, and
staff—about the dangers of heart
disease,’’ said Anne Schroer Lamont,
chair of the university’s health aware-
ness committee. ‘‘We also hope to
have some fun.”’

Schroer Lamont said blood pressure
and cholesterol level testing will be
available in the student center from 8
a.m. to 10 a.m. on Friday, April 29.
The cholesterol and blood pressure
tests will be given for free to the first
100 participants. It is recommended
that those persons taking the
cholesterol test not eat or drink for 12
hours before the test.

In addition to the blood pressure and
cholesterol tests, nutrition information
will be posted in Evans Dining Hall,
the GHQ, and the snack bar. Healthful

meals will be offered in those three lo-
cations for reduced prices at lunch on:
Friday.

The highlight of the festival will be
a jumping rope marathon to raise
money for the American Heart Asso-
ciation. The marathon, which is being
organized by Norm Lord of the physi-
cal education department, is set to be-
gin at 12:30 p.m., April 29, in the
parking lot adjacent to Doremus
Gymnasium.

Teams from all 17 fraternity houses
and other student organizations are
expected to participate. Schroer La-
mont said she is hopeful that at least
one faculty/staff team will participate,
Prizes will be awarded to the indivi-
dual who jumps the longest and to the
team that raises the most money for
the American Heart Association.

The Heart Association will also
award a variety of prizes, from a sta-
dium to a sweatsuit, depending on the
amount of money each jumper raises.
Student and faculty/staff teams can
sign-up Thursday, April 21 at 7 p.m.
in the 500 level classrooms of Dore
mus gym. Each team should have six
members.

OPINION
Spring

It seems spring may have finally arrived on the W&L campus.
Although one can never tell how Virginia weather will behave dur-
ing April (do any natives remember the April blizzard of 19837),
we may safely assume that the worst of the freezing conditions is
behind us.

 

With that reassurance, we can all begin our ‘‘spring term.’’ That
phrase itself conjures many different images. Faculty members look
ahead to a time of competing with Goshen, sunshine, and spring
breezes to gain students’ attention in classes. The response of some
professors is to move their classes outdoors to take advantage of
two of the three factors named above.

Many students have had their first experience of spring already,
having returned from break bringing tans from the beaches, newly
acquired summer job offers, or stories of free time spent at home.

Still other students are spending the spring term away from cam-
pus, taking advantage of W&L’s many offerings for study abroad or
internships in the U.S. Included among those working in internships
are many journalism majors, creating a dearth of Phi staff members
and writers. (Anybody out there interested in reporting the news or
writing ‘‘My View‘ columns?)

Those of us who remain in Lexington seem to be making plenty
of plans to spend time at Goshen or other nearby resort strips, or
planning a different road trip for each weekend of the term. There’s
the Derby, Georgetown, longer jaunts to Atlanta or New York (for
the lucky few among us who only have classes from Tuesday
through Thursday of each week) and shorter, more regular trips to
neighboring colleges.

The change in weather and the evidence of spring—dogwood
blossoms, frisbees and hackey-sacks on the Colonnade, and open
windows in classrooms and dorms—point up the fact that we have
only six more weeks of school until summer break, or graduation
for the seniors. W&L’s unique 12-12-6 academic calendar allows
for a reorganized structure of learning, and the pleasures of the
spring term.

While students at other schools may finish final exams in the
early part of May, we remain until the beginning of June. Although
we may become impatient knowing that some of our friends from
home are already out of school and working on their summer jobs
or tans while we are still studying, we can console ourselves know-
ing that we will still be lounging on the beaches come the end of
August, while they are slaving inside hot classrooms and dor-
mitories, without benefit of central air conditioning.

At least the temperatures in late May are cooler than those in late
August. We don’t have quite the problems that those other students
have. We can take advantage of the outdoors and of the benefits of
W&L’s spring term, continuing our education at the Washington
and Lee Country Club.

Enjoy your spring!

Jackson: where is accountability?

 

MY VIEW
By John Roach

 

This year’s presidential election will
be known as the election in where
many candidates were judged by many
ethical and moral issues such as adul-
tery, plagiarism and one’s in-
volvement in religion. Gary Hart
found that the country could not sto-
mach the lifestyle he led and Joseph
Biden discovered it is not wise to copy
others’ work as well as lie about col-
lege records. The ethical judgments
did not rest just on the candidates of
the Democratic party, but there were
many ethical charges fired at Pat
Robertson over his involvement in re-
ligion as well as some of his activities
while he attended W&L. The one can-
didate who has stayed ‘‘above the
fray’’ as the press and the people have
looked into the backgrounds of the
candidates is the Reverend Jesse Jack-
son.

The Reverend can seem to do and

  

 

say almost anything without being
held accountable. And when one does
try to hold his words and actions
under the same scrutiny with which
we analyze the other candidates, one
is accused of being a racist. George
Will became a racist on the television
show ‘‘This Week With David Brink-
ley’’ for simply questioning some of
Jackson’s statements made in various
speeches. One of the most striking ex-
amples of this came when Jackson
said that SO percent of the federal
budget goes to defense spending and
Will refuted this point, whereupon
Jackson accused Will of being a racist.
One may say this is a very minor point
but it is only the tip of the iceberg.

If all the other candidates’ lives are
going to be studied and questioned,
then Jackson’s past must be analyzed
and reported in the same fashion. The
press hardly ever mentions why the
recent W&L Mock Convention
speaker Andrew Young and Jackson
do not get along. Young accuses Jack-
son of exploiting the murder of Martin
Luther King to his own benefit. Many
who were with Dr. King in Memphis
when he was shot claim that Jackson
took off his shirt and rubbed it in the

WELCOME TO
TERRORIST
TRAINING

   

 
 

blood of Dr. King and then proceeded
to go to talk to the reporters with his
‘*bloody shirt’? on. Only a few ever
mention this highly questionable act.
If Gary Hart and Joe Biden must be
forced out of the campaign for their
misjudgments, then why does the
press not explore the charges some
have directed at Jackson regarding his
extramarital affairs and some highly
questionable discrepancies in Jack-
son’s college activities and records?
The point is not to say Jackson is gui-
Ity of these charges but to ask why his
activities aren’t investigated in the
way the other candidates’ are.

Perhaps the most blatant example of
the kid gloves treatment that the press
gives Jackson is his religious identity.
How many times have we seen the
Reverend Jesse Jackson mix politics in
religion? At least as many times as Pat
Robertson, but Jesse was never ques-
tioned with the same intensity as
Robertson, even though we see Jack-
son almost every week preaching in a
church on Sunday and using the pulpit
as a campaign stump. I am not criticiz-
ing Jackson’s association in religion
but again simply saying that if other
candidates, notably Robertson, are be-

ing attacked for their involvement in
religion, why isn’t Jackson’s role in it
ever questioned?

No one ever questions Jackson on
these fine points probably because
there are not very many people who
enjoy being called racists. And since
almost every time one asks Jackson
tough questions on his personal life he
always underlines his answer with an
accusation of it being a racially biased
question. As one can easily see, we
have a problem here. Jackson has put
his campaign above the scrutiny of the
public by invoking racism at every
turn. The Reverend must realize that it
has nothing to do with racism when
one questions a candidate in the same
fashion that the others are held ac-
countable. How many other candi-
dates have referred to New York City
as Hymietown and how many have as-
sociated with such dubious characters
as’ Fidel Castro and Louis Farrakhan?
Jesse Jackson has now emerged as a
very important and plausible candi-
date for the highest office of our coun-
try. He is no longer a novelty and he
now should answer the tough ques-
tions about his personal life that the
other candidates have been asked.

Presidential Honors

The ROTC Mink Battalion held its first annual President’s Award Banquet in Evans
Dining Hall March 30. The guest of honor, President John Wilson, presented Washing-

Professor Japanese film series offered

from Duke
to speak

From Staff Reports

 

 

Edward B. Fowler, associate
professor of Japanese language and
literature at Duke University, will de-
liver a lecture Wednesday, May 4.
The lecture, ‘‘The Japanese
Novel—An Oxymoron?’’ will be at 8
p.m. in Northen Auditorium and is
open to the public.

The lecture will focus on modern
prose fiction. It will also touch on how
pre-modern literature is clarifying
differences “between Japanese and
western writing.

A specialist in Japanese literature,
Fowler has taught at Duke since earn-
ing his Ph.D, at the University of Ca-
lifornia at Berkeley in 1981. He has
served on the board of directors of the
Association for Teachers of Japanese,
as coordinator for the Triangle East
Asian Colloquium, and as liaison for
the Japan-American Student Confer-
‘ence, 1982-84, at Duke.

The recipient of numerous awards,
Fowler has been named a Fulbright
Scholar for 1989-90. He received a
Social Science Research Council Con-
ference Grant in 1987 and currently
holds a Japan Foundation Professional
Fellowship.

Fowler is currently at work on a
major article on the origins of the
modern Japanese narrative and a
book-length study of Japanese fiction.
He is the author of The Rhetoric of
Confession: Shishosetsu— in Early
Twentieth-century Japanese Fiction
and co-editor of A Hundred Things
Japanese, reprinted under the title,
Discover Japan: Words, Customs,
and Concepts, Vol. 1.

Fowler’s visit is sponsored by
W&L’s East Asian Studies Program.

    
    

 

 

From Staff Reports

 

   

W&L’s East Asian Studies Program
will offer a series of Japanese films
during the spring term. The films will
be shown at 8 p.m. in Room 327 of
the Commerce School on Monday
evenings from April 25 through May
23. Admission is free.

Rashomon, the first offering, will
be shown April 25. Directed by Akira
Kurosawa, this classic film is set at the
crumbling Rashomon Gate in
12th-century Japan, and challenges
traditional truths and morality in its
presentation of one story from four

very different points of view.

The second film, Chushingura,
directed by Hiroshi Inagaki, will be
shown May 2. One of Japan’s most
popular samurai legends, Chushing-
ura is based on an episode that oc-
curred in 1701 when 47 loyal retainers
vowed to avenge the death of their
young provincial lord, Asano.

On May 9, the offering will be The
Mistress, directed by Shiro Toyoda.
Based on Mori Ogai’s novel, Gan
(Wild Geese), The Mistress presents a
story of unfulfilled love, set against a
background of social change. It is re-
garded as one of the best films of the
Meiji Era.

ton and Lee’s Outstanding Cadet Award to Cadet Chris Beckert. Several cadets as well
as other students enrolled in the Military Science classes received commended awards.

Kon Ichikawa, will be shown May 16.
Rated the ‘‘Best Film of the Year”’
(1985) by the Los Angeles Times, the
film tells of four daughters of a great
Osaka merchant family who face the
end of a gentle way of life as old
values give way under the advent of
World War II. It is based on Taniza-
ki’s award-winning novel Sasame yuki
(Light Snow).

The last offering will be Snow
Country on May 23. Drawn from the
novel by the Nobel Prize-winning Ya-
sunari Kawabata, the film captures the
freshness of the geisha Komako and
the sadness of a doomed relationship.
It is directed by Shiro Toyoda.

sity’s programs in Russian language
and area studies and the East Asian
Studies program.

‘*We are again indebted to the Mel-
lon Foundation for making possible
the advancement of two other pro-
grams in the curriculum,’’ said John
W. Elrod, vice president for academic
affairs at W&L. ‘*‘Washington and
Lee is very fortunate to have the con-
tinuing support of this foundation in
the enhancement of our academic pro-
grams.”’

According to Elrod, the Mellon

Tennis completes
3-2 spring sojourn

 

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

Like some other Washington and
Lee students, the members of the
men’s varsity tennis team spent their
spring break week in sunny Florida.
However, they were there on a busi-
ness-first basis. The Generals played
five matches in five days as they

aqtraveled around the Sunshine State.

On Monday, April 11, W&L played
against Stetson in Deland, Florida.
This first match of the trip was quickly
controlled by the visiting Generals,
who led 6-0 after singles action.

Junior Bobby Matthews, who won
against VMI the week before last at
the No. | spot, continued to play as
the top W&L netter. The Generals
won all six singles matches in straight
sets.

The story was much the same in
doubles action, where W&L again rol-
led in straight sets in all three mat-
ches, clinching the win against the
Division I Stetson squad 9-0.

On Tuesday the Generals had
moved north, to Orlando, where they
squared off against another D-I oppo-
nent, Central Florida, in inclement
weather.

The Generals again jumped ahead to
lock up the win in singles action, win-
ning five of the six matches in straight
sets. Freshman Bill Meadows, No. 6
for W&L, had his match called early
because of the rainy conditions.

W&L won all three doubles mat-
ches by default, due to the poor
weather conditions. The Generals had
wrapped up yet another D-I victory,
8-0

The General’s roadtripping contin-
ued, this time to Winter Park, where
they faced rival Rollins College, a
team head coach Gary Franke de-
scribed as simply ‘‘outstanding.”’
These teams have played for the past
several years, and the Rollins squad
has always proved difficult for the
Generals.

The Generals got into early trouble
when they were behind 4- 2 after sin-
gles action. W&L’s two points came
from No. 5 senior Chris Wiman (3-6,
6-4, 6-0) and Meadows (1-6, 6-4,
6-2), both of whom rallied to win in
the third set: >

Rollins, who is ranked second in
D-II collegiate polls, also has the top
two doubles pairs in D-II tennis. The
Generals No. | pair of Matthews and

Roanoke

senior David McLeod lost the first set
at the sixth tie-break point [6-7 (6)],
and won the second set 6-4 before fall-
ing in the third 3-6.

The No. 2 W&L pair of Wiman and
sophomore John Morris lost in
straight sets, while the No. 3 tandem
of Meadows and junior Robert Haley
held on until the third set before falter-
ing, 6-4, 4-6, 4-6.

Rollins won the meeting 7-2, a
deceptive score since six of the nine
matches were won or lost in the third
set.

It was then Thursday, so the Gen-
erals must have been in St. Augustine
facing Flagler. Flager, coached by
Peter Scott, is ranked third in the
NAIA. Again the Generals would find
themselves down after singles, this
time 5-1, and plagued by third-set
blues.

Flager clinched the win in the sin-
gles portion by taking two of the three
long and tough decisions. W&L’s
only singles victory came from Mor-
ris, who won in three sets 6-1, 6-7 (4),
6-1.

Although it was too late, the Gen-
erals doubles did well, and Franke
said that he was ‘‘glad to see the dou-
bles [players] back on track.’’

Friday the Generals faced North
Florida, in Jacksonville. Once again
the team found themselves trailing
after singles, but this time the victory
was within reach, as W&L trailed 4-2.

In the crucial doubles action, Matt-
hews and McLeod won in straight
sets, 6-1, 6-4, but Wiman and Morris
could not hold on to pull out the win,
losing 6-2, 4-6, 3-6. At No. 3, Haley
and Meadows also lost, but in straight
sets.

W&L returned to Lexington and
defeated Averett yesterday on its
home court 9-0, raising its record to
12-7.

As May 8—the day of the tennis
coaches’ conference call to determine
the eight bids to the D-III National
Championship—gets closer, the Gen-
eral’s deadline for getting their game
under control also nears.

‘*We must be able to play well as a
team, consistently.’’ said Franke.

The Generals will have that oppor-
tunity to establish some consistency
when the team plays host to the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pionships on Friday and Saturday.
W&L has won the conference crown
the last three years.

down W&L lax

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

After falling to Hampden-Sydney
Saturday and Roanoke College Tues-
day, the W&L lacrosse Generals will
try to hit the brakes on a five-game
losing skid Saturday when they host
third-ranked Washington College.

The Generals, 2-7 overall and 2-2 in
the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence, have only four games left and
are guaranteed a losing record for the
fourth time in five seasons.

" **We have made some progress, but
we have not demonstrated that pro-
gress in the results of the games,”’
head coach Dennis Daly said Monday.
‘*Sometime down the line, everything
will jell, and we will be the team we
thought we could be.”’

And, in Tuesday’s 12-7 loss at
Roanoke, the Generals did indeed
show some progress, including out-
standing play from freshman goalie
Thomas Costello.

‘‘We kept the score down,’’ Daly
said Wednesday, ‘‘and Tommy was
definitely one reason for that.”’

Daly used four different goalies
against Hampden-Sydney but said he
decided the Maroons would have to
face Costello throughout.

‘*I told him that it was going to be
his won or loss, his sixty minutes,”’
Daly said, whose decision to bet on
the freshman paid off with 19 saves
and only 12 goals.

But a good defensive game was not
enough to keep the Maroons from
their eighth-straight ODAC title. Ad-
mittedly, Tuesday's game wasn’t as

close as the 15-14 overtime thriller
last season, but the game was more

competitive than the five-goal final
margin might indicate.
Although the Generals never led,

they were also never out of it. W&L
was only down 8-7 with eight minutes
left in the third quarter and shut out
the Maroons through most of the
fourth but couldn’t get the scoring

they needed to pull off the win.
‘‘We really didn’t score fast-break,
transition goals,”’

we could have.’’

‘It wasn’t that we weren’t getting
opportunities, and it wasn’t that we
didn’t take shots,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s just

said Daly. ‘‘We
didn’t take advantage of some things

that they didn’t go in.”’

The game started with two Roanoke
goals in five minutes, but W&L junior
midfielder Stuart Geisel scored unas-
sisted to make the score 2-1 with
10:21 left in the first quarter.

Roanoke scored again less than a
minute later, but senior middie Robbie
Stanton answered with an extra-man
goal off a pass from junior attackman
John Ware to make it 3-2 with 7:20
left in the period.

After scoring five goals in less than
eight minutes, both squads played
strong defense through the rest of the
first half. W&L second quarter goals
by Ware and freshman attacker Brian
Overbeck were countered by two
Roanoke scores to give the Maroons a
5-4 halftime lead.

The real scoring began in the third
quarter, with seven goals in as many
minutes. After Roanoke went up by
two, Geisel found the net to make the
score 6-5 with four minutes left in the
third quarter.

The Maroons went up by three with
two goals in the next three minutes.
Stanton and sophomore attacker Chris
Giblin responded again, cutting the
margin to one with 8:13 left in the
period, but those scores were offset by
two Maroon goals late in the quarter.

Even though Roanoke went score-
less through most of the final period,
the Maroons added two insurance
goals late to lock up the victory.

In the 18-14 loss to Hampden-
Sydney Saturday, two W&L midfiel-
ders scored six points to lead the Gen-
erals offensively. Sophomore Chris
Mastrogiovanni recorded five goals
and one assist, and senior Sandy Harr-
ison had four goals and two assists.

The loss left the Generals hoping for
a win Tuesday to force a three-way tie
for the conference title, but the win by
Roanoke gave the Maroons sole pos-
session of the ODAC crown.

Looking ahead to Washington Col-
lege, the Generals will once again be
the underdogs. The Shoremen feature
two former all-Americans and nine re-
turning starters from a team that was
ranked fourth in the nation in Division
III after it reached the national quar-
terfinals.

Washington's leading attackman is
sophomore Tim Hormes, who scored
45 points last season (40 goals, 5 as-
sists). His classmate Mark Cavallaro

Women’s streak at 10

 

From Staff Reports

 

The W&L women’s tennis team
spent a pleasant semester break by
winning all three of its matches and
extending its winning streak to ten.

Coupled with a 8-1 win over Ran-
dolph-Macon yesterday at home, the
Generals will take a 11-1 record into
this weekend's Old Dominion Athletic
championship. Monday’s match
against Hollins was cancelled due to
weather conditions.

The Generals beat Centre on Mon-
day, April 11 in Hilton Head, S.C. in
a contest that was closer than the score
indicates. W&L split the six singles
matches and won all three doubles
matches to earn the victory, but it

didn’t come easy. Six matches went to
three sets and three matches involved
tie-breakers.

W&L then beat Armstrong 9-0 last
Thursday, also at Hilton Head, in a re-
latively easy contest in which the
Generals won every match in straight
Sets.

Finally, W&L beat Emory and
Henry, the defending ODAC cham-
pion, 8-1 Sunday at Emory.

That victory most likely will make
the Generals the favorite in the ODAC
championships on Friday and Satur-
day in Ashland, Va. The W&L squad
will be looking to become the second
women’s team in W&L history to win
a conference championship, with the
women’s swim team being the first
earlier in the year.

While most W&L students were
basking in the sun over spring break,
the General's baseball team was into
some very serious base running. With
three wins over break and another one
yesterday, the team’s record took a
strong lead past the .500 mark to 8-7,
4-6 in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference.

The Generals traveled to Eastern

Mennonite yesterday well supplied -

with heavy hitting bats and light balls.
The score pretty much tells the story
as W&L drove in 18 runs while
Eastern Mennonite responded with
only 3. Senior Carter Steuart pitched
for seven innings to receive the win
before sophomore Dave Smith came
in to Mop up.

Head coach Jeff Stickley commen-
ted on the team’s obvious improve-
ment: ‘‘If people make mistakes, we’-
re taking advantage of it.’’ Stickley
also noted that in the next few days the
competition will be more difficult,
but, with the momentum of a four-
game winning streak, he thinks the
team will be up to the challenge.

The streak began on Sunday, April
10 when the team took Mary Wash-
ington apart at the seams by a score of
12-6. The game against Lynchburg
two days later was rained out, but the

Generais were back in acuon on
Thursday in Lexington versus Shen
andoah.

The Generals were down 3-2 in the
bottom of the ninth inning, but Steuart
was able to knock in a tying run which
was then followed up by a game
winning single from first-year law
student Hugh Finkelstein. The final
score was 4-3. Junior Mike Temple
came up with his first win of the
season and junior Eddie Klank contin
ued to be W&L’s leading hitter with
two more doubles.

Emory and Henry came to Smith
Field this past Sunday only to be held
to a mere one run by Steuart, who pit-
ched the entire game. Steuart and Fin-
kelstein each had a pair of hits, and the
Generals came out with a 7-1 victory

The contest against Hampden-
Sydney was postponed on Tuesday
due to snow. That game will be made
up this afternoon at H-S. On Friday,
the team will make up a game against
Lynchburg, and Sunday W&L will
play host to Maryville in a
doubleheader.

The team is looking for a strong fin-
ish, one that could garner a fourth-
place spot in the conference and the
advantage of playing the ODAC first-
round playoff game at home on Wed-
nesday. ‘‘As long as we continue to
hit the ball we shouldn’t have any
problems,”’ said Klank. ‘‘There is no
reason why we shouldn’t win the rest
of the games.”’

Track qualifies two for nationals

W&L track athletes Andrew White
and Phil Sampson set school records
and qualified for the Division II
national championships while compet-
ing at the Division II & III State Meet
on April 9 in Hampton.

A senior and three-time Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference Runner-
of-the-Year, White placed third in the
110-meter high hurdles with a school-
record time of 14.5 seconds.

Sampson, a sophomore pole vaul-
ter, broke the school record he set last
year and set a new meet record by
clearing 15 feet five inches, four in-
ches better than the qualifiying stan-
dard for nationals.

Two weeks ago, W&L head golf
coach Buck Leslie was anxious. His
team had just started to establish some
consistency, and now it was exam
break and the competitive rounds of

golf were difficult to come by. But if

his team plays like it did this past
week, Leslie has no reason for con
cern.

The Generals took third place in an
Old Dominion Athletic
round robin on Tuesday in Clarksvi
lle, Va. W&L had two players break
80 on the par-71 Kinderton Country

Conference

Club course, with senior James
Sowersby the medalist with a 75. He
received support from senior Gary
Campbell's 79, as the Generals posted
a team total of 324. Hampden-Sydney
and Randolph-Macon tied for first
place with team scores of 319.

But it was what W&L did during the
exam and spring-break stretch in
which the squad would not play a
competitive round of golf for 16 days.
The Generals defeated Shenandoah
311-358 last Thursday in Winchester
with four players scoring in the 70s.

‘“T think all of our guys prepared
themselves pretty well after exams,”’
said Leslie, whose team is now 9-3.
‘They played a lot of rounds. It was a

them,”’ said head coach Norris Aldri-
dge. ‘‘They have worked hard, and
it’s nice to see their work habits pay
of.”’

In other competition at the State
Meet, W&L dominated the distance
events. Senior Richard Moore took
first place in the 5000 and second in
the 1500; junior David Thompson fin-
ished second in the 5000 and third in
the 1500; and junior Jamie Urso took
second in the 800.

W&L’s 400-meter relay team of
Andy White, senior John White,
sophomore Wes Boyd and freshman
Erik Adkins placed fourth and set a
new school record of 43.5 seconds.

Looking ahead, the undefeated
Generals will try to repeat as confer-
ence champions at the ODAC title

water.

The top score for W&L was shared
by Campbell and junior Tom Wing-

pers Valley Golf Course. Following
close behind was senior John Gam
mage with a 78. Senior Kevin Hunt
carded a 79 to bring the team’s total to

The Generals now turn their atten

St. Paul’s highlights Wa&L choral trip

 

By Michael Tuggle

Entertainment Editor

 

A performance in London’s St.
Paul's Cathedral was the highlight of a
choral tour taken by the Washington
and Lee choral ensembles through
England and Wales last week.

Under the direction of Dr. Gordon
Spice and Professor Thomas Forrest
five singing ensembles performed mu-
sic ranging from Palestrina and Ga-
brielli of the Baroque to modern
pieces from English composer John
Rutter. While in Europe, the choruses
sang one and a half hour concerts at
St. Nicholas Church in Hurst, Eng-

land just outside of London, at the
Scala Theatre in Prestatyn, Wales,
and at the Chesterfield Road High
School in Crosby, Merseyside, Eng-
land just outside of Liverpool.

The choruses also performed thirty
minute concerts at St. Paul’s and in
Liverpool at the Roman Catholic cath-
edral known as Paddy’s Wigwam be-
cause of its architectural design.

The five choruses (The men’s Glee
Club, The Women’s Chorus, The
University Chorus, Southern Com-
fort, and the small women’s singing
ensemble yet unnamed) were all rep-
resented by the forty- eight singers
who went on the tour.

While in Hurst, Prestatyn and
Liverpool, the chorus members stayed
with local families from the respective

areas learning a little about what its
like to live in England and Wales,
even if it was only for two days.

While the choruses made a signifi-
cant impact wherever they went, they
made a special one in Hurst and in
Prestatyn. In Hurst, the money for
tickets to the choral concert was do-
nated to a chilaren’s hospital near
Hurst and in Prestatyn, half the money
collected was given by the Prestatyn
Rotary Club to Polio Plus, an interna-
tional Rotary fund-raising program
designed to raise enough funds to in-
noculate all the children of the third-
world.

The choruses spent a great deal of
time singing for the people of England
and Wales, but they also had a great
chance to see some of the wonders of
the two countries as well.

ZBT closes W&L chapter,
will reorganize next fall

 

By Michael Tuggle
Staff Reporter

 

The Zeta Beta Tau national head-
quarters confirmed plans this week to
close the fraternity’s W&L chapter at
the end of the 1987-88 academic year.

While rumors concerning the sol-
vency of W&L’s Alpha Epsilon chap-
ter of ZBT have circulated throughout
the year, all were unfounded until last
Tuesday when ZBT national expan-
sion consultant Scott Sherman infor-
med the W&L brotherhood that the
chapter would be closing this June.

According to Sherman, the Alpha
Epsilon chapter will close due to con-
cern from ZBT national over the di-
minishing number of brothers in the
house.

What the closing means to the cur-
rent brothers is that as of June | they

will conclude their active brotherhood
and will become ZBT alumni. While
they will no longer hold office or Rush
with the house, they will share all
privileges of ZBT alumni.

Concern for increasing the size of
the brotherhood has existed for the
last five years according to ZBT
President Ross Crichton, but ulti-
mately it was this year that turned out
to be the most critical. According to
ZBT Treasurer Jeffrey Norris, rep-
resentatives from national visited the
chapter in the fall and ‘‘encouraged”’
them to get 20 pledges from fall Rush.
Of the 17 men who attended ZBT
open houses during Rush this past fall,
only two pledged the house.

“‘National would have settled for
15,” said Crichton in retrospect, ‘‘but
anything less and they were going to
shut us down.”’

Chapter Vice-President Sean Reyn-

olds agreed that what originally came
across aS an encouragement to get
pledges was in reality an ultimatum

‘*At the beginning of the year they
[national] gave us an ultimatum
we didn’t get a certain number of
pledges they would close and recolon
ize,”” he said.

Though plans concerning Rush have
not yet been finalized, representatives
from ZBT national will be at W&L in
September looking for a group of stu
dents to colonize and reestablish a
ZBT chapter at W&L. If successful,
ZBT will be the first fraternity to co
lonize at W&L since Sigma Nu re
grouped in 1982.

While the brothers of ZBT under
stand the position of the national of
fice, they still question why the house
has to close. According to Norris, the

Survey finds varying degrees of support for coeducation

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Only 58 percent of nearly 1,000
W&L students who participated in a
recent survey said they personally
support coeducation at their school,
but more than 82 percent said the 1984
decision to admit women was in the
school’s best interest academically.

The study was conducted by socio-
logy Professor David Novack’s
research methods class during the last
week of February, and the results
were summarized in a 65-page report
released last week.

According to the report, nearly 65
percent of the freshmen surveyed said
W&L should have become coed,
compared to only 40 percent of the
seniors. About 60 percent of the soph-
omores and the same percentage of
juniors also said they personally sup-
port coeducation.

More than half the seniors sur-
veyed—55.1 percent—said they be-
lieve W&L should not have admitted
women, and about 26 percent of the
freshmen, 28 percent of the sopho-

mores and 32 percent of the juniors
also said they oppose coeducation.

The report said many seniors op-
posed coeducation because theirs was
the last all-male class to be admitted
and because ‘‘the Administration suc-
ceeded in alienating the senior class by
making reference to it as inferior...to
the Class of 1989.””

There was little difference between
classes on whether coeducation was in
the best interest of the school with re-
gard to academic standards. About 88
percent of the juniors, 86 percent of
the sophomores, 81 percent of the
freshmen and 74 percent of the seniors
said coeducation was in W&L’s best
interest academically.

Among the women surveyed, 10
percent said W&L should not have
gone coed, 86 percent supported coe-
ducation, and 4 percent expressed no
opinion. Support was above 80 per-
cent in all three classes of women sur-
veyed, but 14 percent of the sopho-
more women who responded said
W&L should not have admitted fe-
males, compared to 8 percent of the
freshman women and 5 percent of the
juniors,

French author, ‘58,
to give book signing

 

By Marie Dunne
Co-editor

 

Philippe Labro, French journalist,
filmmaker and author of L’Etudiant
etranger, or The Foreign Student, will
be on campus Thursday, May 5 to
help kick off Alumni Weekend with a
lecture and book signing session.

L’Etudiant etranger is based on La-
bro’s experiences as a Fulbright
scholar at W&L during the 1950s.

Labro, who will be celebrating his
30-year reunion with the rest of the
Class of °58, will give an address at
the opening assembly of alumni week-
end in Lee Chapel at 8:15 p.m.

Earlier Thursday, from 1:30 p.m.
to 3:00 p.m., he will be signing copies
of the soon-to-be-released English
translation of L’Etudiant etranger in
the bookstore.

The University Bookstore has made
arrangements to receive 500 copies of
The Foreign Student from Ballantine
Books, which is publishing the Eng-
lish translation in America, according
to Sue LaRue, general books buyer.
The Foreign Student will not go into
general release until June |.

Although the shipment of books has
not yet arrived, ‘‘We are waiting for
the book to be delivered and are anx-
iously optimistic,’” said Tidge Roller,
manager of the bookstore.

The book sells for $5.95,

L'Etudiant etranger spent 30 weeks
in the top ten of the French Best Seller
list, 16 weeks in the number one posi-
tion.

Labro said that while the book is
based on his experiences at W&L and
that his feelings for W&L are genuine,
the work is still fiction, according to
Dick Sessoms, director of alumni
programs, who has spoken with Labro
frequently in the past month.

L'Etudiant etranger never names
W&L as its setting, but it is quite spe-
cific in its references to the lives of
WAL students.

The men were split almost evenly
on the personal opinion question, with
47 percent supporting coeducation, 10
percent undecided and 43 percent op-
posed. About 55 percent of the senior
men surveyed said they believe W&L
should have remained all-male, com-
pared to only 38 percent of the fresh-
man men, 35 percent of the sopho-
mores and 43 percent of the juniors.

The report said these numbers show
“there is still latent animosity regard-
ing coeducation among the males.”’

On the question of whether coeduca-
tion is academically in W&L’s best in-
terest, women were all but unanimous
in their support. Of the 274 female re-
spondents, only one—a_fresh-
man—said the admission of women
was not good for the school academi-
cally. Less than 2 percent of the
women said they had no opinion.

Although the men were not as sup-
portive of coeducation as the women,
about 76 percent of the male respon-
dents said coeducation was in W&L’s
academic best interest. Approximately

14 percent said coeducation was not.»

good for the school academically,
while 10 percent had no opinion.

 

Of those men who said coeducation
was not academically good for W&L,
more than a third were seniors, nearly
30 percent were freshmen, about one-
fifth were juniors and the rest were
sophomores.

The report compared this year’s
study to the results of surveys conduc-

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The student survey found little
support for the creation of sorori-
ties and concluded that W&L stu-
dents, men and women, are satis-
fied with the present Greek system.

Only about 20 percent of those
students participating in the study
said W&L should have sororities,
while more than 43 percent of
those surveyed said it should not.
About 36 percent said maybe.

Half the women surveyed—136

 

ted two, four and eight years ago and
concluded that, ‘‘while the numbers
may not indicate a change in opinion
from 1986 to 1988, there is unmista-
kably [a] trend toward approval of co-
education.”’

According to a report on the 1980
study, more than 50 percent of the

out of 271—said W&L should not
have sororities, while only 15 per-
cent of the females supported the
idea. Among the men, 22 percent
said yes, 37 percent said maybe
and 41 percent said no.

The level of support for sorori-
ties is much smaller than what was
found two years ago. According to
a 1986 survey, 48 percent of the
students surveyed said they
favored sororities, 34 percent were
undecided and 18 percent were op-
posed.

The 1986 study found only slight
differences of opinion between

students surveyed said W&L should
become coed, and 43 percent said no.
Four years later, another study
found that only 42 percent of the re
spondents said women should be ad-
mitted, and 52 percent said no. But

(JSee Survey, page 5

 

Sororities not supported, says survey

men and women on the sorority
question, with females more likely
to say maybe but somewhat less
likely to say yes.

The report concludes that W&L
students are satisfied with the pre-
sent Greek system. ‘‘The women
definitely do not feel the need for
sororities, and the men also reflect
this sentiment, though to a lesser
degree,”’ said the report. “‘It is
thus not a question of fairness but
rather a measurement in the level
of student satisfaction, and the stu-
dents do not want what they do not
need.”

Lee-Jackson Classic ismore than just a game

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L and VMI varsity lacrosse
teams will meet for only the third time
ever Saturday at 3 p.m., but this
contest between the two schools will
be much more than just another la-
crosse game.

Events leading up to the first annual
Lee-Jackson Classic began Monday
and will continue until Saturday night,
according to W&L Athletic Director
William McHenry.

‘*We think this event will be a great
way tO promote sportsmanship and
friendship between the two schools,”’
said McHenry.

The festivities began with a dinner
Monday night in Evans Dining Hall
for players, coaches and officials from
both schools.

Instead of the teams sitting at separ-
ate tables, the players ate together
with the seating alternating between
W&L and VMI players. The school’s
coaches and athletic officials _ sat
together as well.

The dinner was sponsored by the
city of Lexington, and City Manager
Joseph King said the Lee-Jackson
Classic is designed to benefit the city
as well as W&L and VMI.

“It’s an opportunity for the city and
the two schools to join together in an
event that’s enjoyable to the commun
ity,”’ said King, *‘we’re trying to de

a a et A RA NS ae

the role that the two schools
play in the quality of life in this area.”

The event is also an opportunity to
promote the sport of lacrosse, and
players from the two schools are con-
ducting clinics at the schools through-
out the week, said King.

The pre-game festivities continued
today with a luncheon on the W&L
front campus. Head coaches Dennis
Daly of W&L and Doug Bartley of
VMI were the main speakers at the
event, sponsored by the Rockbridge
Area Sports Club

Today's luncheon was designed to
promote ‘“‘town-gown relations’ as
well as sportsmanship and was open to
the public, said McHenry. Civic
leaders, area sports fans and school

officials were expected to attend.

W&L President John Wilson will
host a cocktail party tonight in Lee
House for coaches, athletic officials
and Lexington city officials, again
hoping to promote good relations be-
tween the two schools and the com-
munity.

Lexington Mayor Charles Phillips,
Jr., unveiled the Lee-Jackson Trophy
at the banquet Monday night and will
present it to the winning team after
Saturday's game.

The week ends with a reception
after the game in the Warner Center

for players from both teams and their

parents and coaches, hosted by Daly
and the W&L Athletic Department.

tions. Registrar Scott Dittman will do
an encore performance of his
“*modern Major General.’* The enter-

tainment begins at 8 p.m. in the
Gaines Hall Gatehouse.

On Wednesday, May 4, the G.H.Q.
will offer fish and chips for dinner and
will offer British beer at a reduced

39 members of Class of ‘87
will return as 5-year seniors

 

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

Thirty-nine seniors will not be gra-
duating with their class. According to
University Registrar Scott Dittman,
the students will be returning for
many reasons—not just because they
failed classes.

Of the 341 seniors registered for fail
term at the beginning of the 1987-88
school year, said Dittman, there are
only 302 today who are still active
seniors. That means some 39 seniors
during the course of the year ‘‘have
either disappeared and won't gra-
duate, or decided to graduate next
year,

The most likely reason for most of
these students to postpone graduating
is that they have failed a number of
courses that would have to be made up
next year, said Dittman. Some seniors

didn't get in all the academic require
ments to graduate, which they will
take either here next year or in sum
mer school, said Dittman.

Occasionally a student will decide
to change his major at a time when it is
way too late to fit in all the require
ments for that major, said Dittman
To finish these requirements, or to
fulfill general education or to retake
courses as mentioned before, the stu
dent may not necessarily need to stay
for another entire year. If all his re
quirements are fulfilled by the end of
the fall term of his fifth year, he may
graduate that December, said Ditt
man.

Usually, however, change of majors
occurs early enough that the student
can get all his major requirements in
by graduation. With fifth-year
seniors, said Dittman, ‘ |

OPINION

 

Honor changes

The White Book Revisions Committee suggested several changes
in the W&L Honor System handbook when it submitted its report to
the Executive Committee Monday night.

The EC will vote on the revisions in two weeks.

One particular change which we support is included in the re-
visions to the philosophy section of the pamphlet. This change is the
one most affecting the basic premise of the W&L honor system.

The committee suggested that the clause, ‘‘persons attending
Washington and Lee will not lie, cheat, or steal’’ have a section ad-
ded—‘‘or commit untrustworthy acts’’. The paragraph would then
continue, ‘‘We do not think it is too much to ask that students do
their own work, represent themselves truthfully, act responsibly,
and claim only that which is their own.”’

This change would expand W&L’s honor system to include acts
which are not necessarily lying, cheating, or stealing, but which
violate the trust of the university community.

This change is necessary to continue the tradition of honor pro-
mulgated under the presidency of Robert E. Lee, that all W&L stu-
dents act with behavior suited to the gentleman.

What is this ideal to which we should aspire? What qualifies as
gentlemanly behavior on the W&L campus today? According to our
honor system, gentlemanly and trustworthy behavior is to be
defined by the current student generation.

Many acts which are not lying, cheating or stealing may be con-
sidered dishonorable. Is it honorable to break a commitment, to
reveal a secret which one had promised to maintain, or to write a
check for which one does not have the funds? Probably not.

Another consideration in this change is whether students will
misconstrue the revision to be a moral edict, allowing the EC to in-
flict its ideas of all aspects of proper conduct upon the students
which the EC members have been elected to represent.

This is an empty fear, for the White Book states, ‘‘The Honor
System is not intended to govern minor infractions of the Univer-
sity’s or society’s regulations, but only acts that indicate a student is
not worthy of trust by his or her peers.”’

The White Book Revisions Committee also made several sugges-
tions for improving the procedure for honor proceedings. Of parti-
cular interest are changes which would help an accused student and
the advocates for the accused develop a case. First, the process of
discovery will not depend upon the goodwill and good nature of the
EC president. As the White Book currently states, the accused and
advocates may not contact any EC witnesses before a closed hear-
ing, but the president has discretion over whether the accused may
receive ‘‘information which will allow the accused and his or her
advisor to better understand the reason a witness has been called by
the Executive Committee.’’ (1987-88 White Book, page 5). The re-
vision would require the president to turn over such information at
the request of the accused.

Another change would be beneficial to the accused in the event
of an EC executive session during a trial. Generally, such sessions
are called when the committee wants to vote on the case or discuss
its merits. The revision would allow the accused or the advocates to
request a conference with the student body president ‘‘outside the
presence of the remainder of the Executive Committee.’’ In addi-
tion, the accused and advocates would be allowed to remain in the
hearing room during an executive session.

These adjustments to the discovery and executive session rules
will result in honor proceedings which are even more fair and judi-
cial than those held under current guidelines.

Another improvement affects the advocate system. Many law ad-
vocates are concerned that the number of experienced advocates
diminishes if one or two years pass with few honor proceedings,
whether open or closed. The presence of a third advocate, solely for
the purposes of observation and training, will be allowed at the dis-
cretion of the EC president. This practice would increase the num-
ber of advocates who know about the workings of hearings and
trials, and can only result in a more effective system.

The Ring-tum Phi supports these revisions to the White Book, and
encourages students to read both the report of the revisions commit-
tee and the White Book as it stands, in order to better understand
our Honor System, one of the proudest traditions of Washington
and Lee University.

How was
Sbar’s

break?

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

 

As I left Lexington for spring break
I anticipated entertaining week with
family, friends and gullible freshman
girls from my old high school. Like
most of my expectations these were
also 100 percent wrong. My week of
rest and recreation turned into what
can only be described as a hellish
nightmare. In fact, historians writing
biographies on my tragic life will
probably say, “‘Yes, Sbar getting cut
from the boy scouts in the third grade
did irreparable damage to his psyche
but the spring break of his freshman
year in college (1988) is what drove
the lonely journalist to suicide. Before
we discuss that terrible week in April
let us describe the man. Was he noth-
ing more than an unskilled writer or
was he a deranged drug-crazed
psychopath...”’

Before the historians analyze my re-
cent spring break, I would like to tell
the story in my own words. At first,
everything went fine. My family was
even giving me unprecedented respect
owing to their fear of turning up in
The Ring-tum Phi articles. Consider
this example to illustrate what I mean.

Mom: Jon, would you mind doing
the dishes?

The Ring-tum Phi, April 28, 1988

 

 

**Hey, a White Book! Didn’t I read this freshman year?”’

 

 

 

Me: No, I don’t mind a bit. Besides,
I'll use this in an article sometime.

Mom: (remembering her tendency
as a gross, power-hungry family dicta-
tor who forces me to cook and clean
the house all spring break because she
wants to get back at me for the time
she spent cleaning my room at par-
ent’s weekend). On second thought,
I'll do the dishes. What time do you
want breakfast in bed tomorrow?

Problems started when I received an
invitation to attend a W&L Alumni
party to welcome high school seniors
who had recently been admitted. I
found out the hard way that the party
was bogus—a calculated scheme to
trap me. In retrospect, the invitation
should have tipped me off because at
the bottom someone had scrawled in
blood—‘‘Be there.”’

As I approach the party, I wondered
why the house looked dark and quiet,
but I kept walking anyway. I opened
the door expecting to be greeted by en-
thusiastic alumni congratulating me on
a year well done. The enthusiastic
alumni turned out to be a screaming
mob of khaki-clad right wing W&L
graduates armed with lead pipes,
baseball bats, broken bottles, ax han-
dies and other violence perpetrating
devices. (I also suspected that they
had been drinking). I knew from ex-
perience that an armed and dangerous
group of graduates hostile towards me
could only mean one thing—they had
read some of my articles. Before I lost
consciousness, I remember hearing
comments like, ‘*We have to kill him,
we’re the laughing stock of the uni-
versity. At the last reunion I went to I

was introduced as one of the people
who helped Jon Sbar get into W&L.”’

The W&L Alumni Chapter of Ta-
mpa, Florida interrupts this article to
respond to Mr. Sbar’s allegations.
Mr. Sbar has some sort of Walter Mi-
tty psychological fantasy that he’s im-
portant. The Tampa Chapter has been
using Mr. Sbar’s articles exclusively
for the purposes of house training pets *
and starting fires. Furthermore, we
did not invite Mr. Sbar to the alumni
party over spring break because we
forgot he was a W&L student.

Even though I was already in a body
cast from the alumni ‘‘party’’, my
week was destined to get worse. My
mother made the mistake of schedul-

Senate should not ratify ‘terrible’ INF

 

MY VIEW
By John Roach

 

The United States Senate will soon
vote on whether to ratify the INF
treaty, which was agreed to last
December by President ‘Reagan and
General-Secretary Gorbachev. As
provided by the Constitution, it will
take 2/3 of the Senators to ratify this
“‘historic’’ treaty. The INF treaty is a
bad treaty and should not be ratified
by the Senate.

A brief background on the treaty
may be necessary for one to under-
stand exactly why this treaty is terri-
ble. The treaty provides for the elim-
ination of all intermediate nuclear for-
ces in Europe. This essentially covers
our Pershings in Western Europe and
the Soviets SS-20s located in Eastern
Europe. The treaty does not provide
for the destruction of a single nuclear
warhead, just for the elimination of
the missiles. This point is one of the
main fallacies surrounding the treaty.
Not one nuclear warhead will be des-
troyed and many people such as Sena-
tor Jesse Helms believe that the war-

To the Editors:

The Foxfield Racing Association’s Board of Di-

heads on the SS-20s could be compa-
tible with other Soviet weapons
systems. One may say this is a minor
point and that the provisions in the
treaty for verification will correct all
these lesser problems. But these veri-
fication procedures have just as many
flaws.

The verification procedures, which
President Reagan called ‘‘historic,*‘
are historic only in the sense that we
have been duped. The sites that can be
inspected are not randomly chosen
sites in the Soviet Union but only cer-
tain ones that the Soviets have chosen.
I am sure that we can trust the Soviets
to eschew illegal activities at sites that
are not included in the verification
visits. This question of trust is the bot-
tom line when analyzing the treaty.
We can really forget SS-5s, Persh-
ings, SS-20s, and the other details of
this treaty because in the end it will
not matter, for the Soviets will most
certainly violate the treaty’s prov-
isions.

How can we be sure? It seems that
one could just look back at the So-
viets’ record on past treaties and make
some easy conclusions. The Soviet
Union believes that treaties are a
means to reach an end, and this end is
world-wide domination. We must

learn from the past and see exactly
why a Soviet delegate to the Geneva
Summit stated, ‘‘Nations don’t neces-
sarily follow treaties when it’s not in
their national interest to do so.*‘ Let
us take a closer look at the history of
treaty making and treaty breaking of
the most deceitful country in modern
times.

This country which we are trusting
to abide by the provisions in the INF
treaty is the same nation that violated
the 1945 Yalta Agreement by denying
free elections in Poland. It is the very
same country which broke the Pots-
dam Agreement by occupying Eastern
Europe. And let us never forget their
flagrant disregard of international law
when they shot down KAL-007,
which was carrying many innocent ci-
vilians, including one of our most
patriotic Congressmen, Larry
McDonald. These are just a few of the
over 150 Soviet breaches of interna-
tional security agreements, and this
number doesn’t even include Soviet
violations dealing with arms control
agreements.

The following will shed light on
their compliance record with arms
control agreements. The record for
the Soviets in this field is no better.

ginia. Offenders of the laws, rules and regulations

on Race Day will be prosecuted.

They have disregarded many prov-
isions of the 1972 ABM treaty, and it
is generally accepted they have nine
significant violations of the ABM
treaty, perhaps best illustrated by the
blatant violation of the radar station at
Krasnoyarsk. The list goes on and on.
While stating their intentions of com-
plying with SALT I, they have come
close to ‘violating this treaty twenty
times and their compliance record
with the SALT I interim agreement is
just as shabby. I could fill this entire
newspaper with Soviet arms contro!
and international security breaches,
which began when the tyrannical reign
began in 1917 and continues until this
day.
Hopefully the above examples of
the Soviet Union’s blatant violations
of international agreements has shown
to what degree we can actually trust
them. The Soviet Union can’t be
trusted to any degree. We shouldn’t
make arms control agreements when
we know that the treaty will be broken
when the Soviets decide it is conven-
ient to do so. We should never ignore
history, we should learn from it.
When one looks at the history of the
Soviet Union and their record on fol-
lowing treaties one can easily see why
the INF treaty should not be ratified. _

rectors again announce that due to recent changes
in the laws passed by the General Assembly re-
garding the new drinking age of 21, it will con-
tinue its cooperation this Spring Race with local
groups and authorities to enforce the laws prohib-
iting underage consumption of authorized bever-
ages. Foxfield announces it will, in conjunction
with authorities, prosecute any person who is seen
serving minors in violation of Virginia laws at this
Spring Foxfield Race and also persons who are
underage consuming alcohol on the premises.
This Race, the police and Foxfield will be assisted
by agents from the Alcohol Beverage Commission
of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Chairman of the Board of Directors, J. Benja-
min Dick, states that abuses during the past Fall
Race were nearly all cited in the college and uni-
versity sectors of the visitors on the premises.
However, the drinking laws and policy enforce-
ment will continue to apply across the board for
all patrons visiting the Spring Races. Police, ABC
agents, and Foxfield security shall be directed to
card any juvenile or other person of suspicious
behavior or causing disturbances by reason of any
substance abuse of seen to be under the influence
under the age of 21. Violators may be prosecuted.

Depending on the situation, warnings or sum-
mons may be issued to violators of the laws by the
police or ABC agents. Any person seen or obser-
ved serving minors will be immediately arrested
without a warning. Any person harboring beer
kegs found on the premises, the same will be conf-
iscated.

This notice will be sent to authorities of the col-
leges and universities from which students come
to visit the Races and to student leaders and organ-
izations of those institutions,

Women’s lax wants coverage

To the Editors:

Alright, we are not a varsity team this year; we
are only developmental varsity. The women’s la-
crosse team won our first three games and we now
have a record of 4-6. As this letter is being writ-
ten, we are preparing/hope to beat Virginia Tech.
Is it too much to ask to be mentioned in our il-
lustrious campus newspaper? We realize that the
paper may be short staffed, but the other athletic
events do manage to get covered. It is very surpr-
ising that at a school where men’s lacrosse is a
celebrated sport, the successful creation of a
women’s team doesn’t merit an article, at least, in
the paper. By writing this letter before our last
game, we do risk being reported on before our
season is completely over, what a_ terrifying
thought. We do not mean to be critical of the
paper as a whole, but even The Rockbridge
Weekly published a game photo. Our team has
worked very hard since official practices began on
February | under the expert coaching of Jan
Hathorn, and we believe that we deserve some to-
ken of recognition for our efforts. We hope that
the sports editor will take this as constructive
criticism, so that future newly created teams will
not be entirely neglected. We would like to thank
those fans who have attended our games thanks to
our word-of-mouth publicity.

A commitment to honor

To the Editor:

The Naval Academy Foreign Affairs Confer-
ence has just finished. We were invited, but for
the second time in eight years we did not attend.
We told them there would be a W&L contingent
but somehow the beaches of Florida and Bermuda
got in the way and, after all, what is a commit-
ment if you can’t break it. Never mind the fact
that they had provided room and board for the
W&L representation and had assigned them to
specific discussion tables. They will ask us again,
probably. But we will not accept over my signa-
ture again.

The honor code at W&L should include keeping
one’s word. A commitment is a commitment and
only a broken leg frees you from it. I hope this
message finds a home.

should rope them together and float them in from
the Chesapeake Bay.

Health Festival
will help hearts

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

Members of all 17 fraternities, the
football team, the faculty, the women
students, the wrestling team, and
ROTC plan to jump to raise money for
the American Heart Association tom-
morrow from 12:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.
The jump rope contest is a part of the
Health/Wellness Festival and Greek
Week.

Dean Anne Schroer Lamont, Chair
of the Health Education Committee,
and her committee members organ-
ized this event in conjunction with the
American Heart Association.

Says Schroer Lamont, ‘‘Jump rope
for Heart is a nationwide event desig-
ned to promote healthy hearts while
raising funds to support the American
Heart Association.”’

She has received special help from
Professor of Physical Education Norm
Lord and Carol Calkins from the Uni-
versity Center in helping to prepare a
three day program, which began yes-
terday, designed to promote health
and heart fitness. The events included
in the festival are: heart healthy menus
sponsored by the Co-op, Evans Din-
ing Hall, and the General Headquar-
ters Tavern; a luncheon special in the
GHQ for reduced money and points;
and from 8 o’clock to 10 o’clock on
Friday morning, handout information
on good health as well as free blood
pressure check-ups and _ blood
cholesterol level tests will be provided
for students and faculty.

Faculty members who are within
walking distance are asked to walk to
work since the jump rope contest will
take place (weather permitting) in the
parking lot in front of the gym. In case
of rain the event will be moved to the
inside of the gym.

Co-sponsored by the IFC as a part
of Greek Week, the fraternities are
expected to bring their flags and wear
fraternity colors and t-shirts. The
fraternity songs will be played starting
with Phi Kappa Psi, established first at
W&L, and ending with Chi Psi, estab-
lished most recently at W&L.

‘‘We want to establish team spirit
and a festival atmosphere,’’ says Cal-
kins. She said balloons, concessions
on sale for the spectators, and student
radio announcers keeping people
abreast of the events taking place, will
all help to promote a festive atmos-
phere.

Three awards will be given out at
the awards ceremony following the
contest. The Team Champion Award
will be presented to the team whose
six team members accumulate the
greatest amount of ‘‘jump time.’’ The
Individual Champion Award will be
given to the individual jumper who
jumps the greatest amount of time.
The team which raises the largest sum
of money for the American Heart As-
sociation will receive a special award.

The Heart Association is sponsoring
prizes according to how much money
an individual raises. When an indivi-
dual has raised five dollars in dona-
tions, he will receive a stadium
cup—$15= a jump rope, $35= a
T-shirt, $55= an aero disc, $85= a
watch, $125= an athletic bag, $175=
a hooded sweat shirt, $225= sweat
pants, $300= an ear phone AM/FM
radio.

Those who help plan the event
stress that the awards and prizes are
not the main focus of this contest, and
that all money is to be donated to the
American Heart Association in order
to provide funds for research and
other projects.

Calkins says the importance of the
Health/Wellness Festival is to ‘‘make
people aware of how important fitness
is for your health.”” ,

The American Heart Association
provides many programs which edu-
cate the public on how to prevent heart
disease and stroke, because according
to the Association, ‘‘Nothing kills
more than heart disease and strokes.
And nothing is more important than
preventing them.”

After driving into a telephone pole,
I made it to my dermatologist. Only
after entering the office did I realize
that my dermatologist was in the
process of giving a seminar on
‘*Severe Acne Cases’’ and I was his
major case study. I became exhibit A
(for acne) in the discussion. Here’s an
example of one of the more polite
questions:

Doctor Mortibund (to my doctor):
Your subject’s (me) case of acne is the
most severe case I’ve ever seen. His
face looks worse than Hiroshima after
the atomic bomb!

My Doctor: (excited at the publici-
ty). Yes, Dr. Mortibund, isn’t it re-
markable.: Of course, the subject’s
poor personal hygiene is definitely a
factor in his acne. We have calculated
that he has washed his face only seven
times between 1980 and 1986.

Subject (me): Doctor, could you
lethally inject me with something in

The Ring-tum Phi, April 28, 1988

the next 2-3 minutes.

The lethal injection wasn’t quite
lethal so I headed for the dentist. Inci-
dentally, look up acne in the recently
published World Book Encyclopedia
and you can see my face. At the den
tist, I reminisced on the good old days
when dental hygienists wore simple
white nurse outfits. My hygienist now
wears a lead radiation suit that left no
exposed skin and gold plated gloves
strong enough to resist knife blades.
Of course, the uniform’s highlight
was a platinum-based, fully spit-proof
face shield. My hygienist said the face
shield was top of the line. ‘‘It was
even tested with terrorist blow tor-
ches,”’ she bragged.

One thing that hasn't changed with
dental hygienists is their attitude. As
my hygienist dug into my gums with
her silver tipped battery powered ce-
ment drill (also top of the line equip-
ment) she initiated a friendly conver-
sation. :

Hygienist: You know it might help
if you start brushing.

Me: (accidentally spitting on her
shield). Honestly, I do brush my

teeth

Hygienist: Then maybe you should
start putting toothpaste on the brush.
By the way, has anyone ever told you
that you salivate heavily?

Me: Yes, my sexual therapist

Hygienist: You mean_ there's
someone in the world who is your
sexual therapist?!! And I thought I had
a hard job.

Me: Could I have some laughing
gas?

The last night of my spring break
was spent in a motel (not hotel) in
South Carolina. This motel was an
appropriate end to my vacation. The
place is beyond description but I'll
give the reader an idea of the place's
quality. I will describe the billboard
out front. Instead of advertising ‘‘Ca-
ble TV”’ or some other amenity. the
sign said ‘‘Beds Sink’’. At least now I
know never to stop at a place that costs
less for a night than a meal at Burger
King.

As I look back on my spring break I
regret that I didn’t donate my body to
science for the week.

Lexington city elections
will include five from W&L

aad
By Pat Lopes
Staff Reporter

 

Four W&L faculty members and a
student are candidates in the May 10
Lexington city elections.

Edward Henneman, associate
professor of law, is challenging in-
cumbent Charles Phillips, professor of
economics, in the race for mayor.

Markham Pyle, a law student, Brian
Shaw, W&L’s news office director,
and Tom Imeson, chemistry professor
and director of the computer center
are all running for city council.

‘*We have to find some way of in-
creasing our revenues if we are to stay
an independent city,’’ said Henne-
man.

Sources of income for the city bud-
get is the major concern for all the
candidates.

Faced with a lack of funds, the city
may lose its independent status. If so,
local concerns, such as city schools,

housing, the: police force, and the

‘maintenance of roads instead will be
‘administered by Rockbridge County.
Real estate taxes constitute a large
part of the city budget. W&L, one of
the city’s largest landowners, has a
tax-exempt status. However, W&L
requires a substantial amount of city
services. Yet, student purchasing
power and rent payments are the main
pillar of life for many local mer-
chants, who in turn pay city taxes.
Nevertheless, members of the W&L
community should realize that they
too have responsibilities toward the
future of the city, said Henneman.
‘*The university and its students are

members of a larger community,”’
says Henneman. ‘‘Students should be
interested in the community here.”’
Henneman said he wants to head a
new administration at city hall which
will help create the needed economic
growth.

Charles Phillips, current mayor of
Lexington, has been in office for 17
years.

He pointed out that W&L student
activities traditionally create traffic,
noise, and security problems, espe-
cially near fraternity houses.

He said he hopes students will fol-
low in the successful footsteps of this
year’s Interfraternity Council and
Mock Convention Committee.

Those organizations, said Phillips,
worked closely with police, and kept
community security problems to a
minimum.

 

Charles Phillips

Pyle says he has a unique view of
the Lexington community. He is a
student, a resident, and a business
owner.

He came here from Texas in 1980
as an W&L undergraduate. Since then
he has obtained his undergraduate de-
gree here and gone on to W&L’s law
school from which he will graduate in
June. He is also part-owner of The
Flipside.

**As someone connected to and de-
voted to W&L, but not tied to it for
my bread and butter, I might have a
clearer picture on how to deal with
problems,”’ said Pyle.

He said he thinks W&L has a re-
sponsibility toward the future of the
city. Pyle pointed out the service fee
W&L pays to the city, the only legal

Bergstrom
searches

for early
birds

By David Emrich
Co-Editor

 

 

Getting up early on Saturday morn
ing is for the birds.

Just ask W&L Professor of Biology
Peter Bergstrom. In the law school
parking lot every Saturday morning at
7:30 a.m. Bergstrom begins a weekly
ornithological tour of the area.

Bergstrom said he got the idea for
the bird walks during a class he taught
ina W&L summer program.

Bergstrom said as part of a course
he taught on birds he started taking the
students on bird walks.

“‘] got a very positive response to
the bird walks [during the summer
program] and thought why not try it
during spring term?”’

He said spring is the best time for
bird walks because during this time of
year ‘‘you see a lot of migrating birds
that you wouldn't otherwise see. —

‘*You also see the males in their
breeding plumage which makes them
a lot easier to identify,” Bergstrom
said.

Bergstrom said he offered the bird
walks last year but the response
wasn't as good as he had hoped. This
year’s response, he said, is much bet-
ter.

“I think part of the problem last
year was that I started the bird walks
at 7:00 a.m.,”’ said Bergstrom.

**There were people coming from a
long way away and to be here at 7:00
they probably had to get up a little too
early.

‘*This year I moved the time back to
7:30 and the response has been bet-
ter..””

Twenty people went on last Satur-
day’s walk, he said.

Bergstrom said there will be bird
walks through May 21 but that he
wouldn’t be conducting the walk on
May 7. He explained he would be at
‘‘a bird meeting’ and that a friend of
his would take his place.

As a final note Bergstrom added,
“The bird walk will be cancelled in
event of rain, ©

‘There aren't many birds out when
it rains, and anyway, your binoculars
have a way of fogging up.”

INTENTIONAL SECOND EXPOSURE

OPINION

 

Honor changes

The White Book Revisions Committee suggested several changes
in the W&L Honor System handbook when it submitted its report to
the Executive Committee Monday night.

The EC will vote on the revisions in two weeks.

One particular change which we support is included in the re-
visions to the philosophy section of the pamphlet. This change is the
one most affecting the basic premise of the W&L honor system.

The committee suggested that the clause, ‘‘persons attending
Washington and Lee will not lie, cheat, or steal’’ have a section ad-
ded—‘‘or commit untrustworthy acts’. The paragraph would then
continue, ‘‘We do not think it is too much to ask that students do
their own work, represent themselves truthfully, act responsibly,
and claim only that which is their own.”’

This change would expand W&L’s honor system to include acts
which are not necessarily lying, cheating, or stealing, but which
violate the trust of the university community.

This change is necessary to continue the tradition of honor pro-
mulgated under the presidency of Robert E. Lee, that all W&L stu-
dents act with behavior suited to the gentleman.

What is this ideal to which we should aspire? What qualifies as
gentlemanly behavior on the W&L campus today? According to our
honor system, gentlemanly and trustworthy behavior is to be
defined by the current student generation.

Many acts which are not lying, cheating or stealing may be con-
sidered dishonorable. Is it honorable to break a commitment, to
reveal a secret which one had promised to maintain, or to write a
check for which one does not have the funds? Probably not.

Another consideration in this change is whether students will
misconstrue the revision to be a moral edict, allowing the EC to in-
flict its ideas of all aspects of proper conduct upon the students
which the EC members have been elected to represent.

This is an empty fear, for the White Book states, ‘‘The Honor
System is not intended to govern minor infractions of the Univer-
sity’s or society’s regulations, but only acts that indicate a student is
not worthy of trust by his or her peers.’’

The White Book Revisions Committee also made several sugges-
tions for improving the procedure for honor proceedings. Of parti-
cular interest are changes which would help an accused student and
the advocates for the accused develop a case. First, the process of
discovery will not depend upon the goodwill and good nature of the
EC president. As the White Book currently states, the accused and
advocates may not contact any EC witnesses before a closed hear-
ing, but the president has discretion over whether the accused maj
receive “information which will allow the accused and. his.
advisor to better understand the reason a witness has been called
the Executive Committee.’’ (1987-88 White Book, page 5). The re-
vision would require the president to turn over such information at
the request of the accused.

Another change would be pebeficial: to the-accused in the event
of an EC executive session during a trial. Generally, such sessions
are called when the committee wants to vote on the case or discuss.
its merits. The revision would allow the accused or the advocates to
request a conference with the student body president ‘‘outside the
presence of the remainder of the Executive Committee.’’ In addi-
tion, the accused and advocates would be allowed to remain in the
hearing room during an executive session. —

  
 

These adjustments to the discovery and executive session rules
will result in honor proceedings which are even more fair and judi-
cial than those held under current guidelines.

Another improvement affects the advocate system. Many law ad-
vocates are concerned that the number of experienced advocates
diminishes if one or two years pass with few honor proceedings,
whether open or closed. The presence of a third advocate, solely for
the purposes of observation and training, will be allowed at the dis-
cretion of the EC president. This practice would increase the num-
ber of advocates who know about the workings of hearings and
trials, and can only result in a more effective system.

The Ring-tum Phi supports these revisions to the White Book, and
encourages students to read both the report of the revisions commit-
tee and the White Book as it stands, in order to better understand |
our Honor System, one of the proudest traditions of Washington
and Lee University.

How was
Sbar’s

break?

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

 

As I left Lexington for spring break
I anticipated entertaining week with
family, friends and gullible freshman
girls from my old high school. Like
most of my expectations these were
also 100 percent wrong, My week of
rest and recreation turned into what
can only be described as a hellish
nightmare. In fact, historians writing
biographies on my tragic life will
probably say, ‘‘Yes, Sbar getting cut
from the boy scouts in the third grade
did irreparable damage to his psyche
but the spring break of his freshman
year in college (1988) is what drove
the lonely journalist to suicide. Before
we discuss that terrible week in April
let us describe the man. Was he noth-
ing more than an unskilled writer or
was he a deranged drug-crazed
psychopath...’’

Before the historians analyze my re-
cent spring break, I would like to tell
the story in my own words. At first,
everything went fine. My family was
even giving me unprecedented respect
owing to their fear of turning up in
The Ring-tum Phi articles, Consider
this example to illustrate what I mean.

Mom: Jon, would you mind doing
the dishes?

The Ring-tum Phi, April 28, 1988

 

 

‘*Hey, a White Book! Didn’t I read this freshman year?”’

 

 

 

Me: No, I don’t mind a bit. Besides,
I'll use this in an article sometime.

Mom: (remembering her tendency
as a gross, power-hungry family dicta-
tor who forces me to cook and clean
the house all spring break because she
wants to get back at me for the time
she spent cleaning my room at par-
ent’s weekend). On second thought,
I'll do the dishes. What time do you
want breakfast in bed tomorrow?

Problems started when I received an °

invitation to attend a W&L Alumni
party to welcome high school seniors

who had recently been admitted. I
pcabeastcaal ves epee pel
was bogus—a calculated scheme to
trap me. In retrospect, the invitation
should have tipped me off because at
the bottom someone had scrawled in
blood—‘‘Be there.”

As I approach the party, I wondered
why the house looked dark and quiet,
but I kept walking anyway. I opened
the door expecting to be greeted by en-
thusiastic alumni congratulating me on
a year well done. The enthusiastic
alumni turned out to be a screaming
mob of khaki-clad right wing W&L
graduates armed with lead pipes,
baseball bats, broken bottles, ax han-
dies and other violence perpetrating
devices. (I also suspected that they
had been drinking). I knew from ex-
perience that an armed and dangerous
group of graduates hostile towards me
could only mean one thing—they had
read some of my articles. Before I lost
consciousness, I remember hearing
comments like, ‘“We have to kill him,
we’re the laughing stock of the uni-
‘versity. At the last reunion I went to I

was introduced as one of the people
who helped Jon Sbar get into W&L.”’

The W&L Alumni Chapter of Ta-
mpa, Florida interrupts this article to
respond to Mr. Sbar’s allegations.
Mr. Sbar has some sort of Walter Mi-
tty psychological fantasy that he’s im-
portant. The Tampa Chapter has been
using Mr. Sbar’s articles exclusively
for the purposes of house training pets
and starting fires. Furthermore, we
did not invite Mr. Sbar to the alumni
party over spring break because we
forgot he was a W&L student.

Even though I was already in a body
cast from the alumni ‘‘party’’, my
week was destined to get worse. My
mother made the mistake of schedul-

Senate should not ratify ‘terrible’ INF

 

MY VIEW
By John Roach

 

tor Jesse Helms believe that the war-

heads on the SS-20s could be compa-
tible with other Soviet weapons
systems. One may say this is a minor
point and that the provisions in the
treaty for verification will correct all
these lesser problems. But these veri-
fication procedures have just as many
flaws.

The verification procedures, which
President Reagan called ‘‘historic, *
are historic only in the sense that we
have been duped. The sites that can be
inspected are not randomly chosen
sites in the Soviet Union but only cer-
tain ones that the Soviets have chosen.
I am sure that we can trust the Soviets
to eschew illegal activities at sites that
are not included in the verification
visits. This question of trust is the bot-
tom line when analyzing the treaty.
We can really forget SS-5s, Persh-
ings, SS-20s, and the other details of
this treaty because in the end it will
not matter, for the Soviets will most
certainly violate the treaty’s prov-

How can we be sure? It seems that
one could just look back at the So-
viets’ record on past treaties and make
some easy conclusions. The Soviet
Union believes that treaties are a
“means to reach an end, and this end is
world-wide domination. We must

learn from the past and see exactly
why a Soviet delegate to the Geneva
Summit stated, ‘‘ Nations don’t neces-
sarily follow treaties when it’s not in
their national interest to do so.‘ Let
us take a closer look at the history of
treaty making and treaty breaking of
the most deceitful country in modern
times.

to abide by the provisions in the INF
treaty is the same nation that violated
the 1945 Yalta Agreement by denying
free elections in Poland. It is the very
same country which broke the Pots-
dam Agreement by occupying Eastern
Europe. And let us never forget their
flagrant disregard of international law
when they shot down KAL-007,
which was carrying many innocent ci-
vilians, including one of our most
patriotic Congressmen, Larry
McDonald. These are just a few of the
over 150 Soviet breaches of interna-
tional security agreements, and this
number doesn’t even include Soviet
violations dealing with arms control
agreements.

The following will shed light on
their compliance record with arms
control agreements. The record for
the Soviets in this field is no better.

LETTERS

 

They have disregarded many prov-
isions of the 1972 ABM treaty, and it
is generally accepted they have nine
significant violations of the ABM
treaty, perhaps best illustrated by the
blatant violation of the radar station at
Krasnoyarsk. The list goes on and om.
While stating their intentions of com-
plying with SALT I, they have come
close ‘to 'vidlating this treaty twenty
with the SALT I interirit agreement is
just as shabby. I could fill this entire
newspaper with Soviet arms contro}
and international security breaches,
which began when the tyrannical reign
began in 1917 and continues until this
day.

Hopefully the above examples of
the Soviet Union’s blatant violations
of international agreements has shown
to what degree we can actually trust
them. The Soviet Union can’t be
trusted to any degree. We shouldn’t
make arms control agreements when
we know that the treaty will be broken
when the Soviets decide it is conven-
ient to do so. We should never ignore
history, we should learn from it.
When one looks at the history of the
Soviet Union and their record on fol-
lowing treaties one can easily see why
the INF treaty should not be ratified. _

 

Foxfield organizer warns of regulations |

To the Editors:

The Foxfield Racing Association's Board of Di-
rectors again announce that due to recent changes
in the laws passed by the General Assembly re-
garding the new drinking age of 21, it will con-
tinue its cooperation this Spring Race with local
groups and authorities to enforce the laws prohib-
iting underage consumption of authorized bever-

‘ages. Foxfield announces it will, in conjunction
with authorities, prosecute any person who is seen
serving minors in violation of Virginia laws at this
Spring Foxfield Race and also persons who are
underage consuming alcohol on the premises.
This Race, the police and Foxfield will be assisted
by agents from the Alcohol Beverage Commission
of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Chairman of the Board of Directors, J. Benja-
min Dick, states that abuses during the past Fall
Race were nearly all cited in the college and uni-
versity sectors of the visitors on the premises.
However, the drinking laws and policy enforce-
ment will continue to apply across the board for
all patrons visiting the Spring Races. Police, ABC
agents, and Foxfield security shall be directed to
card any juvenile or other person of suspicious
behavior or causing disturbances by reason of any
substance abuse of seen to be under the influence
under the age of 21. Violators may be prosecuted.

Depending on the situation, warnings or sum-
mons may be issued to violators of the laws by the
police or ABC agents. Any person seen or obser-
ved serving minors will be immediately arrested
without a warning. Any person harboring beer
kegs found on the premises, the same will be conf-
iscated.

This notice will be sent to authorities of the col-
leges and universities from which students come
to visit the Races and to student leaders and organ-
izations of those institutions.

Women’s lax wants coverage

To the Editors:

Alright, we are not a varsity team this year; we
are only developmental varsity. The women’s la-
crosse team won our first three games and we now
have a record of 4-6. As this letter is being writ-
ten, we are preparing/hope to beat Virginia Tech.
Is it too much to ask to be mentioned in our il-
lustrious campus newspaper? We realize that the
paper may be short staffed, but the other athletic
events do manage to get covered. It is very surpr-
ising that at a school where men’s lacrosse is a
celebrated sport, the successful creation of a
women’s team doesn’t merit an article, at least, in
the paper. By writing this letter before our last
game, we do risk being reported on before our
season is completely over, what a terrifying
thought. We do not mean to be critical of the
paper as a whole, but even The Rockbridge
Weekly published a game photo, Our team has
worked very hard since official practices began on
February | under the expert coaching of Jan
Hathorn, and we believe that we deserve some to-
ken of recognition for our efforts. We hope that
the sports editor will take this as constructive
criticism, so that future newly created teams will
not be entirely neglected. We would like to thank
those fans who have attended our games thanks to
our word-of-mouth publicity.

A commitment to honor

To the Editor:

The Naval Academy Foreign Affairs Confer-
ence has just finished. We were invited, but for
the second time in eight years we did not attend.
We told them there would be a W&L contingent
but somehow the beaches of Florida and Bermuda
got in the way and, after all, what is a commit-
ment if you can’t break it. Never mind the fact
that they had provided room and board for the
W&L representation and had assigned them to
specific discussion tables. They will ask us again,
probably. But we will not accept over my signa-
ture again.

The honor code at W&L should include keeping
one’s word. A commitment is a commitment and
only a broken leg frees you from it. I hope this
message finds a home.

P.S. If we ever send another contingent, we
should rope them together and float them in from
the Chesapeake Bay.

Health Festival
will help hearts

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

Members of all 17 fraternities, the
football team, the faculty, the women
students, the wrestling team, and
ROTC plan to jump to raise money for
the American Heart Association tom-
morrow from 12:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.
The jump rope contest is a part of the
Health/Wellness Festival and Greek
Week.

Dean Anne Schroer Lamont, Chair
of the Health Education Committee,
and her committee members organ-
ized this event in conjunction with the
American Heart Association.

Says Schroer Lamont, ‘‘Jump rope
for Heart is a nationwide event desig-
ned to promote healthy hearts while
raising funds to support the American
Heart Association.’’

She has received special help from
Professor of Physical Education Norm
Lord and Carol Calkins from the Uni-
versity Center in helping to prepare a
three day program, which began yes-
terday, designed to promote health
and heart fitness. The events included
in the festival are: heart healthy menus
sponsored by the Co-op, Evans Din-
ing Hall, and the General Headquar-
ters Tavern; a luncheon special in the
GHQ for reduced money and points;

and from 8 o’clock to 10 o’clock on

Friday morning, handout information
on good health as well as free blood
pressure check-ups and blood
cholestero) level tests Ayil'be provided
for students and faculty.

Faculty members who are within
walking distance are asked to walk to
work since the jump rope contest will
take place (weather permitting) in the
parking lot in front of the gym. In case
of rain the event will be moved to the
inside of the gym.

Co-sponsored by the IFC as a part
of Greek Week, the fraternities are
expected to bring their flags and wear
fraternity colors and t-shirts. The
fraternity songs will be played starting
with Phi Kappa Psi, established first at
W&L, and ending with Chi Psi, estab-
lished most recently at W&L.

“‘We want to establish team spirit
and a festival atmosphere,’’ says Cal-
kins. She said balloons, concessions
on sale for the spectators, and student
radio announcers keeping people
abreast of the events taking place, will
all help to promote a festive atmos-
phere. ;

Three awards will be given out at
the awards ceremony following the
contest. The Team Champion Award
will be presented to the team whose
six team members accumulate the
greatest amount of ‘‘jump time.’’ The
Individual Champion Award will be
given to the individual jumper who
jumps the greatest amount of time.
The team which raises the largest sum
of money for the American Heart As-
sociation will receive a special award.

The Heart Association is sponsoring
prizes according to how much money
an individual raises. When an indivi-
dual has raised five dollars in dona-
tions, he will receive a stadium
cup—$15= a jump rope, $35= a
T-shirt, $55= an aero disc, $85= a
watch, $125= an athletic bag, $175=
a hooded sweat shirt, $225= sweat
pants, $300= an ear phone AM/FM
radio.

Those who help plan the event
stress that the awards and prizes are
not the main focus of this contest, and
that all money is to be donated to the
American Heart Association in order
to provide funds for research and
other projects.

Calkins says the importance of the
Health/Wellness Festival is to ‘‘make

people aware of how important ‘fitness “housing, the~ police force, and the

is for your health.”’ , -

The American Heart Association
provides many programs which edu-
cate the public on how to prevent heart
disease and stroke, because according
to the Association, ‘‘Nothing kills
more than heart disease and strokes.
And nothing is more important than
preventing them.”’

After driving into a telephone pole,
I made it to my dermatologist. Only
after entering the office did I realize
that my dermatologist was in the
process of giving a seminar on
**Severe Acne Cases’’ and I was his
major case study. I became exhibit A
(for acne) in the discussion. Here’s an
example of one of the more polite
questions:

Doctor Mortibund (to my doctor):
Your subject’s (me) case of acne is the
most severe case I’ve ever seen. His
face looks worse than Hiroshima after
the atomic bomb! _

My Doctor: (excited at the publici-
ty). Yes, Dr. Mortibund, isn’t it re-
markable” Of course, the ‘subject's
poor personal hygiene is definitely a
factor in his acne. We have calculated
that he has washed his face only seven
times between 1980 and 1986. ~

lethally inject me with something in

the next 2-3 minutes.

The lethal injection wasn't quite
lethal so I headed for the dentist. Inci-
dentally, look up acne in the recently
published World Book Encyclopedia
and you can see my face. At the den-
tist, I reminisced on the good old days
when dental hygienists wore simple
white nurse outfits. My hygienist now
wears a lead radiation suit that left no
exposed skin and gold plated gloves
strong enough to resist knife blades.
Of course, the uniform’s highlight
was a platinum-based, fully spit-proof
face shield. My hygienist said the face
Shield was top of the line. ‘‘It was
even tested with terrorist blow tor-
ches,’’ she bragged.

One thing that hasn't changed with
dental hygienists is their attitude. As
my hygienist dug into my gums with
her silver tipped battery powered ce-
ment drill (also top of the line equip-
ment) she initiated a friendly conver-
sation.

Hygienist: You know it might help
if you start brushing.

Me: (accidentally spitting on her
shield). Honestly, I do brush my

teeth.

Hygienist: Then maybe you should
start putting toothpaste on the brush.
By the way, has anyone ever told you
that you salivate heavily?

Me: Yes, my sexual therapist.

Hygienist: You mean there's
someone in the world who is your
sexual therapist?!! And I thought I had
a hard job.

Me: Could I have some laughing
gas?

The last night of my spring break
was spent in a motel (not hotel) in
South Carolina. This motel was an
appropriate end to my vacation. The
place is beyond description but I'll
give the reader an idea of the place’s
quality. I will describe the billboard
out front. Instead of advertising ‘*Ca-
ble TV" or some other amenity. the
sign said ‘*Beds Sink’’. At least now I
know never to stop at a place that costs
less for a night than a meal at Burger
King.

As I look back on my spring break I
regret that I didn’t donate my body to
science for the week.

Lexington city elections
will include five from W&L

 

By Pat Lopes
Staff Reporter

 

Four W&L faculty members and a
student are candidates in the May 10
Lexington city elections.

Edward Henneman, associate
professor of law, is challenging in-
cumbent Charles Phillips, professor of
economics, in the race for mayor.

Markham Pyle, a law student, Brian
Shaw, W&L’s news office director,
and Tom Imeson, chemistry professor
and director of the computer center
are all running for city council.

‘*We have to find some way of in-
creasing our revenues if we are to stay
an independent city,’’ said Henne-
man.

Sources of income for the city bud-
get is the major concern for all the
candidates.

Faced with a lack of funds, the city
may lose its independent status. If so,
local concerns, such as city schools,

4 maintenance of roads instead will be
‘administered by Rockbridge County.
Real estate taxes constitute a large
part of the city budget. W&L, one of
the city’s largest landowners, has a
tax-exempt status. However, W&L
requires a substantial amount of city
services. Yet, student purchasing
power and rent payments are the main
pillar of life for many local mer-
chants, who in turn pay city taxes.
Nevertheless, members of the W&L
community should realize that they
too have responsibilities toward the
future of the city, said Henneman.
‘*The university and its students are

members of a larger community,”’
says Henneman. ‘‘Students should be
interested in the community here.’’
Henneman said he wants to head a
new administration at city hall which
will help create the needed economic
growth.

Charles Phillips, current mayor of
Lexington, has been in office for 17
years.

He pointed out that W&L student
activities traditionally create traffic,
noise, and security problems, espe-
cially near fraternity houses.

He said he hopes students will fol-
low in the successful footsteps of this
year’s Interfraternity Council and
Mock Convention Committee.

Those organizations, said Phillips,
worked closely with police, and kept
community security problems to a
minimum.

Pyle says he has a unique view of
the Lexington community. He is a
student, a resident, and a business
owner.

He came here from Texas in 1980
as an W&L undergraduate. Since then
he has obtained his undergraduate de-
gree here and gone on to W&L’s law
school from which he will graduate in
June. He is also part-owner of The
Flipside.

**As someone connected to and de-
voted to W&L, but not tied to it for
my bread and butter, I might have a
clearer picture on how to deal with

He said he thinks W&L has a re-

Bergstrom
searches

for early
birds

By David Emrich
Co-Editor

 

 

‘walks last year but the response

eventof rain

Getting up early on Saturday morn-
ing is for the birds.

Just ask W&L Professor of Biology
Peter Bergstrom. In the law school
parking lot every Saturday morning at
7:30 a.m. Bergstrom begins a weekly
ornithological tour of the area.

Bergstrom said he got the idea for
the bird walks during a class he taught
ina W&L summer program.

Bergstrom said as part of a course
he taught on birds he started taking the
students on bird walks.

‘I got a very positive response to
the bird walks [during the summer
program] and thought why not try it
during spring term?”’

He said spring is the best time for
bird walks because during this time of
year “‘you see a lot of migrating birds
that you wouldn't otherwise see.

‘**You also see the males in their
breeding plumage which makes them
a lot easier to identify,’’ Bergstrom
said.

Bergstrom said he offered the bird

wasn’t as good as he had hoped. This
year’s response, he said, is much bet-
ter.

“I think part of the problem last
year was that I started the bird walks
at 7:00 a.m.,’’ said Bergstrom.

‘*There were people coming froma
long way away and to be here at 7:00
they probably had to get up a little too
early.

‘*This year I moved the time back to
7:30 and the response has been bet-
ter!”

Twenty people went on last Satur-
day’s walk, he said.

Bergstrom said there will be bird
walks through May 21 but that he
wouldn’t be conducting the walk on
May 7. He explained he would be at
‘‘a bird meeting’’ and that a friend of
his would take his place.

As a final note Bergstrom added,
“‘The bird walk will be cancelled in

 

‘There aren't many birds out when
it rains, and anyway, your binoculars
have a way of fogging up.”’

Women’s singing group

is still deliberating a name

 

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

A new singing group has recently
emerged on campus. The group’s 11
female members include ten singers
and a piano accompanist who give
choreographed, _ light-entertainment
performances using a variety of popu-
lar tunes, old and new.

Since around the middle of winter
term, these women have been collect-
ing music and choreographing for per-
formances at various social events.
Their first performance was for a fa-
culty open house at Gaines Hall. They
then went on to perform in the Pre-
Tour Concert in Lee Chapel and again
during the University Chorus’s tour of
England over spring break.

They will also be singing during
several of the school’s social events
during the next few weeks, including
Brit Fest, Alumni weekend and Con-
fetti’s.

Lucy Anderson, one of the group’s

two alternates, said that the group
consisted ‘‘mainly of junior [women]
in the University Chorus and
Women’s Chorus.’’ Anderson said
auditions would be held next year for
old and potentially new members. The
group may increase its membership,
said Anderson.

According to member Christine
Davis, the idea for an all-female en-
semble of this kind had been discussed
by the women since their freshman
year. It was only about a couple of
months ago that music department
members were asked to serve as
judges, auditions were held, and the
idea became a reality.

A name for the group is still being
deliberated by the group’s members:
Liz Smith, Cathleen Tiernan, Court-
ney Harpold, Margaret Pimblett,
Kristen Barnes, Christine Davis (jun-
ior members): Amy Hatcher, Chamie
Schildt (freshman members): Lucy
Anderson, Michele Brockman (junior
alternate members): and Julie She-
phard (piano accompanist).

obligation, should be reviewed.

Just as Pyle has seen several pers-
pectives of Lexington life, Shaw
knows of a number of city councils
throughout the Shenandoah Valley

which have dealt with issues similar to-

those faced in Lexington.

Shaw came here in 1981 as the
Shenandoah Valley reporter for the
Roanoke Times & World News. He
became news director at W&L in
1985.

Shaw said his work in journalism
motivated him to run. He says it hel-
ped him come to the ‘‘realization that

 

 

city councils and school boards are the
bodies most responsive to consti-
tuents.”’

He emphasized that city council
deals with issues that directly involve
the lives of his friends and neighbors,
in addition to his own family and his
work place.

Imeson has been a member of the
city council for 17 years.

In his years here he says he’s seen
the city, as well as W&L, grow
slowly. He also says he’s watched the
streets, lined with the cars of W&L
students. There, he sees yet another

way to raise some revenue for the
city.

Imeson says requiring local car
stickers for student cars may become
an issue for the next city council.

first. Although there were only two
possible answers, nearly 15 percent of
those surveyed wrote in some other
response, many trying to combine
marriage and career, according to
Novack.

Among the men who participated in
the study, nearly two-thirds said their
careers were more important, and
49.1 percent of the women agreed.
But 37 percent of the women said they
would choose marriage over a career,

while only 18 percent of the men
would do the same.

Nearly 85 percent of the men sur-
veyed said they intend to have chil-
dren, as did 72 percent of the women.
Only 3.4 percent of the men and 7
percent of the women said they do not
want children. The rest of the respon-
dents—12 percent of the men and 21
percent of the women—said maybe.

More than 78 percent of those sur-
veyed said mothers should stay home
from work for a few months to care
for newborn children, according to the
report. About 69 percent of the men
surveyed said they feel strongly that
the mother should stay home, com-
pared to 52 percent of the women.
Only about 21 percent of the respon-
dents said the mother should be free to
decide.

Women’s singing group

is still deliberating a name

 

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

A new singing group has recently
emerged on campus. The group's 11
female members include ten singers
and a piano accompanist who give
choreographed, _ light-entertainment
performances using a variety of popu-
lar tunes, old and new.

Since around the middle of winter
term, these women have been collect-
ing music and choreographing for per-
formances at various social events.
Their first performance was for a fa-
culty open house at Gaines Hall. They
then went on to perform in the Pre-
Tour Concert in Lee Chapel and again
during the University Chorus’s tour of
England over spring break.

They will also be singing during
several of the school’s social events
during the next few weeks, including
Brit Fest, Alumni weekend and Con-
fetti'’s.

Lucy Anderson, one of the group’s

two alternates, said that the group
consisted ‘‘mainly of junior [women]
in the University Chorus and
Women’s Chorus.’’ Anderson said
auditions would be held next year for
old and potentially new members. The
group may increase its membership,
said Anderson.

According to member Christine
Davis, the idea for an all-female en-
semble of this kind had been discussed
by the women since their freshman
year. It was only about a couple of
months ago that music department
members were asked to serve as
judges, auditions were held, and the
idea became a reality.

A name for the group is still being
deliberated by the group’s members:
Liz Smith, Cathleen Tiernan, Court-
ney Harpold, Margaret Pimblett,
Kristen Barnes, Christine’ Davis (jun-
ior members): Amy Hatcher, Chamie
Schildt (freshman members): Lucy
Anderson, Michele Brockman (junior
alternate members): and Julie She-
phard (piano accompanist).

city councils and school boards are the
bodies most responsive to consti-
tuents.””

He emphasized that city council
deals with issues that directly involve
the lives of his friends and neighbors,
in addition to his own family and his
work place.

Imeson has been a member of the
city council for 17 years.

In his years here he says he's seen
the city, as well as W&L, grow
slowly. He also says he’s watched the
streets, lined with the cars of W&L
students. There, he sees yet another
way to raise some revenue for the
city.

Imeson says requiring local car
stickers for student cars may become
an issue for the next city council.

“*He was very eager to experience
everything American that he could,”’
said John Jennings, head of the de-
partment of journalism, who attended
WA&L at the same time as Labro.

‘*Most of his fellow students real-
ized that he had extraordinary talent as
a filmmaker, as a writer, and as a
journalist.”

While at W&L, Labro was greatly
influenced by O. W. ‘‘Tom”’ Riegel,
then head of the journalism depart-
ment, said Jennings.

While Labro came to W&L with the
idea of becoming a journalist, “Riegel
* encouraged him to develop his talents

In 1986, support of coeducation was

compared to 58 percent overall and 47
percent among the men in 1988. But
less than 69 percent of those surveyed

The original idea of the Brit Fest
began when Dean of Freshmen and
Residential Life, Ken Ruscio, sug-

of program about Britain.

“I think he wanted to encourage the
international students to get involved,
to use the fact that we’re coming in
with a different outlook and to extend
cultural awareness,’’ said Peppiatt.

“I know there are a lot of W&L
people interested in travel, and this is
a fine way to let them know a little bit

more about what's going on,”’ said
Peppiatt.
Peppiatt says that she expects many

students who have traveled to England

importance of marriage and careers by
asking students, ‘‘After you graduate
from college, if you have to select
marriage OR a career, which one
would you choose?”’

More than 61 percent of the respon-
dents said they would put their careers
first, while less than a quarter—23.6
percent—said marriage would come
first. Although there were only two
possible answers, nearly 15 percent of
those surveyed wrote in some other
response, many trying to combine
marriage and career, according to
Novack.

Among the men who participated in
the study, nearly two-thirds said their
careers were more important, and
49.1 percent of the women agreed.
But 37 percent of the women said they
would choose marriage over a career,

while only 18 percent of the men
would do the same.

Nearly 85 percent of the men sur-
veyed said they intend to have chil-
dren, as did 72 percent of the women.
Only 3.4 percent of the men and 7
percent of the women said they do not
want children. The rest of the respon-
dents—12 percent of the men and 21
percent of the women—said maybe.

More than 78 percent of those sur-
veyed said mothers should stay home
from work for a few months to care
for newborn children, according to the
report. About 69 percent of the men
surveyed said they feel strongly that
the mother should stay home, com-
pared to 52 percent of the women.
Only about 21 percent of the respon-
dents said the mother should be free to
decide.

Three W&L teams capture ODAC titles |

Seniors lead the way
as golfers card crown

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Some great performances by a trio
of seniors helped the W&L golf team
put together two rounds of excellent
scoring and win the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference championship
Monday and Tuesday at the Kinderton
Country Club in Clarksville, Va.

Led by seniors James Sower-
sby—whose two-round total of 155
(76-79) earned him medalist hon-
Gary Campbell (157, 78-79) and
John Gammage (158, 83-75), the
Generals posted a two-day score of
629 on the par-71 course, beating sec-
ond place Lynchburg (637) by eight
strokes. The rest of the team results
were Hampden-Sydney with 646,
Randolph-Macon with 649, Roanoke
with 657 and Bridgewater with 671.

ors

‘‘T was happy for our seniors to go
out with [a conference title],”’ said
head coach Buck Leslie, who was
named ODAC Coach-of-the- Year. All
three seniors were named to the
ODAC all-conference team.

‘It was a team effort. Everybody
had a hand in the scoring,”’ said Les-
lie. “*They went about it with some
confidence. Their attitudes coming
into the championship were very

good.”’

The General's fourth score was a
combination of the rounds of senior
Kevin Hunt and junior Pete Coleman
Hunt carded a 78 on the first day, and
Coleman added a 81 on the second
day

W&L was tied with Lynchburg at
315 at the end of the first round, be-
fore closing out the competition with a
314 on Tuesday.

“It was a nice surprise,’* said Leslie
of the W&L win. ‘‘It didn’t look good
at the beginning of the year, but we've
been playing much better than we did
at that point in the season. I told the
guys that I though we could win the
thing.”’

Leslie said one key to the win was
Gammage’s second round. After a
tough 83 on the first day of action,
Gammage bounced back with a spec-
tacular 75, his best round of the year.

With the championship now se-
cured, the Generals will now submit
their team statistics and two indivi-
dual’s statistics to the NCAA Division
III National Championship‘s selection
committee. Leslie said he is not sure
of his team’s chances of being selected
to compete and that he would not be
notified until after May 1.

‘We just have to wait it out and
cross our fingers,’” he said.

 

 

 

The W&L women’s tennis team
came within one half point of winning
the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence title Friday and Saturday at Ran-
dolph-Macon.

The Generals scored 50 points, but
were beaten by Mary Baldwin with
50’.

W&L freshman Jean Stroman, who
won the No. | singles flight, was
named ODAC Player-of-the-Year.
She beat Karen Whitt of Mary Bald-
win 6-4 6-1 in the championship.

Other flight winners for the Gen-
erals were freshman Kelly Martone
and sophomore Teresa Southard.
Martone won the No. 2 singles flight
by defeating Lolly Marks of Lynch-
burg 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. Southard was vic-
torious at No. 4 singles when she
handily defeated Tracy Gaedcky 6-1,
6-3.

W&L coach Bill Washburn, whose
team finished with a 11-1 record this
season, was selected ODAC Coach-

Looking at the team’s final statis-

year. Southard had a 12-2 record, fol-
lowed by freshman Shawn Wert
(11-2), junior Benny Savage (12-3)
and Stroman (11-4). In doubles, the
tandem of Martone and Wert had the
best record at 13-2, trailed by the pair
of junior Martha Christian and soph-
omore Laura Eggers (10-4) and Stro-
man and freshman Kathy Leake (7-3).

Men’s tennis sweeps
competition in finals

 

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

In their only action this week, the
W&L men’s tennis team played host
to the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence Tennis Championships, played
on Friday and Saturday.

The usual field of eight ODAC
teams was narrowed to seven for the
tournament when Maryville announ-
ced that they would not be attending.
No reason is known for this decision,
but no changes were made in the tour-
nament by ODAC officials.

Led by junior Bobby Matthews,
playing again in the No. | position for
W&L, the Generals swept the week-
end, placing team members in the top
position in each of six singles and
three doubles flights.

Matthews won his three singles
matches handily, taking each in
straight sets. He lost a total of only
seven games on his way to winning
the No. | singles flight. Matthews
defeated Randolph Macon’s No. 1
man, Danny Dever, for the title 6-0,
6-1.

Junior Robert Haley, at No. 2 for
the Generals, also won his flight.
Haley needed three sets to knock off
Lynchburg’s Steve Horowitz in the
second match of the afternoon 6-2,
4-6, 6-1, but returned to straight-set
form to beat Bridgewater College’s
Jeff Moyer for the crown 6-2, 6-3.

W&L senior co-captain David

McLeod had an even better outing
than Matthews, allowing only five
games to his opponents as he rolled to
becoming the King of the No. 3 Hill.

McLeod won the title game from
Roanoke’s John Gardner quickly, 6-0,
6-1.

The speed record would not be held
by McLeod, as John Morris won the
No. 4 mantle against Roanoke’s Jeff
Persell without allowing a single game
to any of his foes.

After a first round bye due to Mary-
ville’s absence, Morris defeated
Lynchburg’s Rob Haughey in straight
sets, 6-0, 6-0. Morris did not allow a
single game to his final opponent,
Persell, winning 6-0, 6-0.

Senior co-captain Chris Wiman
locked up the No. 5 throne, defeating
his opponents in straight sets across
the board.

Wiman did need three tie-breaker
points in the second set of the final
match, against Lynchburg’s Scott
Watson, 6-2, 7-6 (3).

Not wanting to be left out, W&L’s
No. 6 man, freshman Bill Meadows,
also raced to capture his blue ribbon.

Meadows began by whipping
Bridgewater's Bryan O'Bannon 6-0,
6-0, then moved up to face Roanoke’s
Preston Shoemaker, whom Meadows
dispatched 6-1, 6-2.

Meadows also made quick work of
Hampden Sydney’s Russ Parrish, 6-1,
6-2, to win the No. 6 flight.

Baseball season over
with loss in playoffs

Hornets hand Generals 9-4 defeat

 

By Gary McCullough
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L baseball team’s season
came to a close yesterday afternoon
after a loss to Lynchburg College in
the first round of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference playoffs. The
Generals dropped two other games
this week as well, leaving the season’s
final mark at 8-9.

W&L played well in their playoff
game against Lynchburg tallying up
four runs off of five hits. First-year
law student Hugh Finkelstein hit a tri-
ple and then was driven home by
senior Carter Steuart. Junior Eddie
Klank had two hits on the day, and a
dropped fly ball off the bat of junior
Harry Halpert scored another run.
Steuart was the starting pitcher fol-
lowed up at relief by junior Chris
Cunningham and junior Mike Temple.
The team played well, but Lynchburg
was just too tough and stayed on top
for the 9-4 victory.

The make-up game at Hampden-
Sydney College last Thursday was not
the highlight of the season for W&L.
While the Generals were able to knock

in a total of 10 runs, they were
nonetheless outplayed by the Tigers
who brought home 21.

The last regular season game was
Friday at Lynchburg. W&L did
slightly better than it did against
Lynchburg in the playoff game, but it
wasn’t quite enough. The Generals
scored six runs while Lynchburg
scored nine. Cunningham started the
day on the mound and was relieved by
sophomore David Smith.

The season’s 8-9 record was some-
what disappointing for the team, but
Finkelstein commented on the im-
provements which the team has made
in recent years: ‘‘The last time I
played on the team was when I was
junior, and things have improved a lot
since then. I think that’s mostly due to
[head] coach [Jeff]Stickley. He’s a lot
more conducive to work with, and
he’s been really great with the ath-
letes,’

Stickley was also pleased with the
difference in the team’s work this
year. ‘‘We’re pretty happy with the
year overall,’’ he said. ‘‘We played a
lot better baseball than we did the last
year or so. We're pleased with the
direction we’re moving in.””

 

A. White leads track
in conference blowout

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L track Generals won sev-
en events, set four school records and
three conference records, scored the
most points in the history of the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference and
basically steamrolled the ODAC Sat-
urday on their way to W&L track’s
fourth- straight conference title.

Senior Andrew White will have to
make room for his fourth—that’s
right, fourth—ODAC Runner-of- the-
Year Award. The W&L hurdler broke
his own school record and set a new
ODAC record with a time of 14.3
seconds in the 110-meter hurdles,
took second in the 400 hurdles, and
ran on W&L’s record-setting 400 and
1600 relay teams.

Junior Scott Williams, who had not
competed collegiately in running
events until this year, won the 400
meters in a school-record 49.3 sec-
onds, ran on both relay teams, placed
second in the 200 to W&L sophomore
Wes Boyd, and took third in the dis-
cus.

‘‘Andy and Scott were outstand-
ing,’’ said head coach Norris Aldri-
dge. ‘‘I am really proud of what they
have accomplished. ”’

Boyd was the only General to win
two individual events, taking the 200
in 22.4 seconds and the 100 in 10.8
seconds.

As usual, W&L racked up in the

distance events. Junior Jamie Urso
broke the two-minute mark to win the
800 in 1:57.6, and senior James Bu
quet and freshman Jeffrey Baucgum
finished 5- 6.

In the 1500, senior Richard Mdore
placed second, freshman David Mar
tin was third, junior David Thompses
finished fourth and senior Scott Rip-
peon was sixth. Thompson also plaged
second in the 5000, and Martin and
Moore finished right behind hint in
third and fourth place ,

In the 400-meter relay, the W&L
team of White, Williams, Boyd and
freshman Erik Adkins set fire to she
Bridgewater College track with a time
of 42.7, a new conference record.
Williams and White teamed with U;so
and senior John White in the 1600 re-
lay to set yet another conference ‘e-
cord (3:22.9). ‘

While the running events provided
141 of W&L’s 183 and “points, the
Generals also picked up points in the
field events. Junior Jim Ambrosini
was third in the shot and fourth in the
discus. Sophomore Phil Sampson took
second in the pole vault, where senjor
Rob Williamson finished fourth, and
seniors Sean Connolly and senior Jofin
Veatch finished 3-4 in the javelin.

MILEPOSTS—The team totals Sat-
urday were not even close. W&L’s
183 and % points easily outpaced
number-two Bridgewater, with 126
and 2 points.

Junior Eddie Klank had two hits in yesterday’s playoff loss to
Lynchburg.

Lax loss streak hits seven.

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The 2-9 W&L lacrosse Generals,
struggling under the weight of a sev-
en-game losing streak, will try for
their first win since March 16 when
they play host to VMI and take on the
nation’s leading scorer Saturday in the
first annual Lee-Jackson Classic.

Two top-ten Division III teams kept
the W&L losing skid going for yet an-
other week. Third-ranked Washington
College handed the Generals a 20-9
beating Saturday on Wilson Field, and
W&L didn’t fare much better Wed-
nesday in a 15-7 loss to fifth-ranked
Franklin and Marshall.

Both D-III powers used big scoring
runs to take out W&L. On Saturday,
Washington outscored the Generals
10-1 in the game’s last 23 minutes,
and F&M scored 12 unanswered goals
Wednesday, including an 8-0 second
quarter, to keep the Generals 0-for-
April.

‘*We've played well in spurts, but
we haven’t played the complete sixty-
minute game,”’ said head coach Den-
nis Daly. ‘‘Somewhere along the line,
we've got to click for the sixty
minutes.””

Against Washington, Daly said he
was most concerned about midfielders
Chris Dollar and Mike McGuane.
While W&L did restrict the Shoremen
middies somewhat, WC _ attackman
Paul Miller more than made up the
difference with four goals and nine as-
sists.

OA er ERS eee Ss

‘They just moved the ball very
well, and he was in the right position
at the right time,’’ Daly said of Mil-
ler. ‘‘I was really impressed. They’re
an outstanding team.”’

As they had in every game this
season, the Generals fell behind early.
In fact, WC was up 5-0 with just sec-
onds left in the first period when jun-
ior attacker John Ware scored unas-
sisted to end the shutout.

In the second quarter, two-straight
Shoremen goals were followed by a
W&L three-goal run, and the slow-
down game the Generals were playing
looked like it might pay off.

Freshman attackman Brain Over-
beck scored his second career goal to
make the score 7-2 with 2:55 left in
the first half, and sophomore midfiel-
der Chris Mastrogiovanni scored just
seconds later to cut the margin to four.

Then, after a slashing penalty
against Washington, W&L_ senior
midfielder Sandy Harrison scored an
extra-man goal on a pass from Over-
beck with only a minute left to pull the
Generals to within three at halftime.

The W&L swing continued in the
second half, with Ware again scoring
unassisted with less than 90 seconds
gone in the third quarter, cutting the
Washington lead to two.

The Shoremen responded with a 4-0
run, including one goal and two assists
by Miller, but W&L cut the score
from 10-5 to 10-8 on two goals by
senior attackman Peter Smith and one
by Ware, his third of the day.

Then all hell broke loose with a
10-1 Washington College scoring

blitz, keyed by great transition passing
and WC domination in second-half
faceoffs.

A lonely unassisted goal by juniof
middie Stuart Geisel was the only hint
of protest the Generals could muster,
as the offense became as silent as the
defense was helpless.

‘*There’s a point in the game when,
you start to say, ‘The game’s close, ~
but we’ ve got to do something to try to
make it closer,’’’ said Daly. ‘‘But, by
trying to do those things, we had to
leave our game plan, which allowed it
to be close in the first place.’’

Despite giving up 19 goals to the
Shoremen, freshman Tom Costello*
once again did good work in goal for,
the Generals, making 21 saves and
forcing WC to do most of its scoring?
one-on-one, usually on transition or,
when quicker attackmen evaded an

;

outmanned W&L defense. ‘
‘I don’t fault Tommy at all,’’ Daly,
said of the Washington College

pounding late in the game. *‘He made’
the saves that allowed us to be in posi
tion to win that game. We've got to do
the other part of it."’

And, against fifth-ranked Franklin
& Marshall, the Generals appeared
capable of doing that ‘‘other part of
it,”’ at least early on. For the first time
this season, W&L started the scoring,
as senior middie Robbie Stanton
scored an extra-man goal just 52 sec
onds into the game to put the Generals
up 1-0.

But it didn’t last. The Diplomats

In doubles action, the Generals con-
inued their winning ways, sweeping
ul three flights.

After a first-round bye, the No. |
W&L pair of Matthews and McLeod
continued its consistent play by blank-
ing Hampden Sydney’s pair, Arnz and
Simanis, 6-0, 6-0.

Lynchburg’s couple of Haughey
and Lawson faired little better, falling
to the No. 1 Generals’ pair 6-2, 6-0, in
the flight’s title match.

W&L’s No. 2 pair of Wiman and
Morris also enjoyed the added rest of
a first-round bye, then unloaded on
Emory and Henry’s Bolton and Lakey
6-1, 6-1.

Wiman and Morris defeated Ran-
dolph Macon’s Barry and Persell 6-1,
6-4 for the claim to No. 2 doubles
fame.

In action in the No. 3 doubles flight,
W&L’s duo of Meadows and Haley
also won big. Roanoke’s Shoemaker
and Nick Burlew fell first, 6-2, 6-1.
Next was Hampden Sydney’s Cobb
and Parrish, who held on until the
third set only to lose 6-1, 5-7, 6-0.

Haley and Meadows squared off
against a better-rested Lynchburg
team of Horowitz and Watson, who
had been given a first-round bye and a
6-1, 6-2 victory over their second-
round adversaries from Emory and

Washington and Lee also did well at

Franke thought that the team ‘‘just

VMI is not weak at the other end,
either. Senior Tom Towers, the

Any doubt as to whether VMI can

The worstalbums in history

 

By Greg Ossi
Music Critic

 

You can always spot those articles
that have been written because the
writer has nothing really substantial to
write about. I am referring to the self-
serving articles that come under sus-
picious titles like ‘“‘The 100 Best
Songs of 1987"’ or ‘‘The Ten Best
Albums of 1987’’ or my favorite,
**The Ten Best Albums of All-Time.”

I call these articles self-serving be-
cause that’s about all who cares about
what has been written. Musical tastes
are dependent on personal opinion and
everyone has his own. Just because
one has a title like music critic
shouldn't justify the publication of
such a waste of time. Each person ac-
tually thinks that his opinion is the
correct one.

However, this argument does not
quite work the other way around. Part

Instrumentalists

of a music critic’s job is to point out
various flaws in a record. Sometimes
the whole record is a mistake. As in
English where there is no agreement
over who has written the best work
most agree that when something is
bad, it’s real bad.

I've taken three paragraphs of your
time to tell you that I basically have
nothing to write about and am now go-
ing to enlighten you as to the ‘‘Ten
Worst Albums of All-Time.’’ Once
again, I remind you, this is the ten
worst albums to me.

I will start off with the best of the
worst. Making its appearance at num-
ber ten is Bad. The title says it all.
Michael pulled a fast one on his fans.
He made a couple of terrible tracks,
greased ‘em up, slapped ‘em on some
vinyl and called it Bad. He wanted to
see if his loyal worshippers of the one
true white sequinned glove would buy
anything he put out, even if it was
Bad.

They bought it.

hart and his other bovine organs.

blow through
the Bahamas

 

By Jason Lisi
Staff Reporter

 

When I think about the GREAT
times I’ve had in college—those times
that will stand apart from my overall
memories of my time at Washington
and Lee— I remember a few specific
instances: tearing at my fraternity,
eluding the Hollins security guards
early one morning, drinking at Pan-
ther Falls, taking a Physical Education
*class’ by skiing at the Homestead,
etc.

During this spring break I added
another to this list: taking a cruise to
the Bahamas with the W & L Wind
and Percussion Ensembles.

The 18-member group, led by Mu-
sic Professor Robert Stewart, usually
takes a trip or two every year to play
the music prepared during class.
Through massive amounts of planning
by Stewart and the band’s student
leaders, the group took a 4-day cruise,
playing on the ship and at the College
of the Bahamas in Nassau. We all had
a great time.

But how could we not have had a
great time in the Bahamas? Oh sure,
the W & L Chorus went to England,
saw boring stuff like Westminster Ab-
bey and claimed to have a ‘‘great
time,‘‘ but we sat on a warm, isolated
beach as the crystal-clear turquoise
water lapped at our feet. Which would
you rather do? I think I know the an-
swer.

The cruise began on Monday after a
rather long chartered bus ride to
Miami Beach. Once there, the mem-
bers of the group put the ride behind
them and focused on the activities of
the cruise.

And there were enough activities to

please everyone. The casino and slot
machines were open virtually every
waking hour, and someone in our
group was either getting ridiculously
lucky or was losing like mad. There
was always some kind of entertain-
ment going on, from movies three
times a day to glitzy, overenergetic
Vegas-type ‘‘Variety Spectaculars,”’
where part of the presentation in-
cluded a four-member singing and
dancing group wasting their talent
right before our eyes by trying to get
us to cheer as they called out the
names of the states. Most of us didn’t
oblige.

On the second day of the cruise, the
ship docked at Nassau, where we
played our concert at the College of
the Bahamas, where the group gave a
concert last year. The program con-
sisted of work from the Baroque
period (Palestrina) to today (including
‘‘Devertissment: Omnibus’’ by
Professor Stewart and a percussion
piece by W & L sophomore Robert
Beveridge). The ensembles were well
received by the students who found in
us a good reason to blow off studying
for finals.

Later that evening the members of
the group split up to see the sights of
Nassau, stay on the boat, or go to Par-
adise Island.

* Rough seas the next day prevented
the passengers from going to the
cruise line’s private island, Little Stir-
rup Cay. This day was spent at sea and
the ensembles played another concert
in the afternoon. The audience filled
the showroom to hear our concert and
we received hearty applause, especial-
ly from one particularly vociferous
spectator—‘‘Jerry’’ to those who
know and love him.

Thursday, when the seas died down
and the passengers were able to go to
the island, was perhaps the best day of

Listening to any of the multitude of
tracks on this album will cause the
listener to destroy his stereo. I have
never heard a better attempt at retail-
ing cacophonous noises as soulful mu-
sic.

In this age of progressive music
many record/radio industry magazines
have sprung up. Most of these I can-
not stand because they only serve the
purpose of trying to promote each and
every released album in the world.
This has somehow led to a group
called the Zodiac Mindwarp Love
Reaction or something. The lyrics
sound like they have been written by
an out of work porn screenwriter on
LSD who has just experienced a cys-
toscopy. The music reminds me of the
time I spilled water all over my five
dollar K-Mart speakers.

When you hang a dog by his tail and
hit him with a baseball bat, what
sound does he make? Blarf, or so the
members of that now extinct group
would have you believe. Number sev-
en is the album Blarf by Blarf and if
you can’t understand why, imagine
yourself listening to the sound of an

Emergency Broadcast Test signal and
liking it better.

I have never admired Don John-
son's taste in clothes or in music. His
album deserves number six.

Paving the way for the mellowest
garbage ever made is Air Supply and
their Greatest Hits album. Need I say
more?

Burning up the tracks at number
four is speed—speed metal that is. I
would put a particular album here but
since they all sound the same why
bother?

Who made a comeback in ‘88 and
nobody cared? The Bee Gees that’s
who, and I am still thankful. Disco
died with hair implants, leisure suits
and Saturday Night Fever but some
still live such as those nasal brothers
the Gibbs. Any and all of their produc-
tions account for at least numbers
three and two.

And as for the worst album of all-
time, well I leave that up to your own
judgement. After all, albums are still
being made and who knows when Phi-
lip Glass will try and make a minima-
list album with natural body noises.

the trip. Boats ferried passengers to
the cruise line’s private 10 square mile
island, complete with a bar every 150
yards. Here members of our group
swam, snorkeled, gorged at the coo-
kout, tanned, and/or explored. Some
will remember a sand-flinging, hakey-
sack marathon and ensuing wilderness
walk. While we sat on the clean, un-
crowded beach, soaking in the rays
and concentrating on nothing but
having a good time, we came to the
realization that the trip had transfor-
med itself from a concert tour to a
great vacation.

Back on the ship that evening the
group watched another of those corny
song-and-dance shows, called the
‘*Farewell Variety Spectacular.’’ This
was good for a few laughs, especially
watching the ‘international recording
star’’ Fernando bomb his way through
bad Top-40 covers and his philosophy
of show business. Julio Iglesias should
not worry.

After this, the members of the
group split up and wandered the ship
and its lounges and bars. Two of the
group wandered to the ‘‘Mayfair‘‘
showroom for five heart-pounding
games of bingo. We reconvened at
midnight for something we had to see
to believe— a disco contest. This is
notable particularly for those passen-
gers who took it seriously: a gold-
chained John Travolta- wanna be and
two dozen high school kids from Lou-
isville, Ky. One member of the last

group was a lad who, in public, did

things with his hands and hips which
cannot be adequately related in a fami-
ly newspaper.

Following the contest, several of the
group collected their instruments and
played improvised blues in an empty
lounge until about 4:30 in the morn-
ing. We knew there was not much
sleep and long bus ride ahead of us.

So we left Miami after having a
great vacation. We had not only had
fun, but we entertained a lot of people.
Although our suntans will fade and
our photographs will be shut away,
the members of the W & L Wind and
Percussion Ensemble will carry this
trip, as I will, in their memories long
after we leave Lexington.

Blues completes Neil Simon trilogy

 

By Franklin Daniels
Staff Reporter

Biloxi Blues is Neil Simon’s latest
entry in his autobiographical trilogy.

It’s the story of a ragtag group of
fresh northeastern army recruits
wading their way through boot camp
in what is to them the alien world of
Biloxi, Mississippi. The star of this
assembledge is Eugene, played by
Matthew Broderick, a jewish boy who
manages to escape Brighton Beach
and land himself in the most humid
spot possible to enjoy what is probably
his first dose of the real world. Nat-
urally, this sudden over-exposure is
filled with many hazards, and it is
around these trials and their outcomes
that Simon weaves his story.

The crew Simon assembles is a
microcosm of society, with characters
representing every walk of life, from
the intellectual bookworm to the
strong, overbearing bully.

Each one in this bunch assumes cer-
tain stances as they would normally
and, more often than not, eagerly pre-
sents them to the group. Soon con-
flicts arise and instantly the medium
for both Simon’s humor and his social
commentary is apparent, these often
childish disputes not only supplying
numerous one-liners but helping to
draw growing up and its pains and the
big ugly world around him together

 

ein SSR RRR as ete amr eS 8

Simon has always excelled at dra-
matising a real world situation for
both comic and social reasons and he
does this here, though neither his
statements nor his comedy particu-
larly overwhelm.

He manages to include, very appro-
priately, a whole range of questions
from homosexuality to religion and in
resolving each one he lets his feelings
be known, though not decisively. At
times one finds himself enjoying the
irony of a situation, perhaps retro-
spectively, and is surprised by a gentle
nudge given by the actions of the
characters. They are valid dilemmas
indeed, as are Simon’s statements
about them, but they lack a certain
quality to make one take a long hard
look.

While the goal of the film is not to

make a social statement, if one is go-
ing to make such an effort to present
such Views, One should make them
stick. More than his other recent films
of this type, here Simon takes a stab at
genuine real world commentary that,
while in a comic voice, seems weak.
Nice food for thought between laughs,
but that’s it. Still, he manages, with
the classic happy ending, to leave the
viewer with the feeling that something
good just happened and that everyone
involved, including the viewer, bene-
fitted from it.

This is the bottom line for a film of
this type and Simon seems content to
accomplish this, leaving perhaps a
hint of something more with the dis-
cerning interpreter.

All in all, a nice film, though not
outstanding, unless your choice of

Attendance policy approved

 

- By Marie Dunne
_ Co-editor

 

The faculty has approved a state-
: ment to be added to the university ca-
_ talog that will allow a professor to re-
quire a student to drop a class if the
* student misses the. first class meeting
_ of the term, according to Scott Ditt-

man, university registrar.

The statement, which was passed by
, a voice vote during the faculty’s meet-

ing Monday, reads as follows: ‘‘Facu-
“Ity members may require a previously
. fegistered student to drop a class if the

student misses the first class meeting
“of the term without prior approval of
, the instructor.”’

According to Dittman, this state-
“ment falls under another statement
.already in the Faculty Handbook,

which says ‘‘the nature of a student’s
‘participation in the work of a course”’
.is a matter between the student and fa-
culty member.

‘The faculty members decide at-
.tendance policy. The university has

said it’s not going to make any regula-
‘tions regarding attendance policy in
_classes,’’ said Dittman. The faculty
have always had the power to decide
“attendance policy, he said.

.. ‘*What [this statement] does is al-
low faculty members to make a very
‘restrictive attendance policy,”’ said
Dittman.

» Faculty members may choose to re-
quire students to drop a class if they
miss the’ first class meeting, or they
may ignore the statement and set their
own class attendance requirements,
said Dittman,

Faculty members may also decide to
allow exeeptions to their own policy,
but that is a matter between the indivi-
dual instructor and the student, said
Dittman. E

There are several rationale for the
additional statement, said Dittman.
Because students wait until late in the
first week before dropping a class they
have no intention of taking, faculty
members have no accurate idea of the
final size of the class. Other students
should not be kept out of a class sim-
ply because another student hasn’t
submitted the proper paperwork until
late in the week, said Dittman.

Dittman stresses that the actual
procedure for drop/add still remains
the same. Students must submit the
proper forms and fees to drop a class.
Faculty members will not give the re-
gistrar a list of students to be removed
from a class, he said.

If a student misses the first class,
and the instructor allows another stu-
dent to take his place in the class, it is
up to the student to convince the
professor that the student had suffi-
cient reason to miss the class, said
Dittman.

If the student cannot convince the

Forum debates Middle

+ Last Thursday five experts turned
Lee Chapel into a forum on the cur-
rent Palestinian/Israeli problem in the
‘Middle East. The panel discussion,
organized by two W&L students, was
the second of its kind this year.

' Gordon Byer, Former U.S. Ambas-
-sador to Egypt; Milton Colvin,
Professor of Politics; Frederic Kirgis,
“Dean of the Law School; Gregory
-Stanton, Assistant Professor of Law;
_and Bruce Herrick, Chairman of the
Economics Department were the pan-
-elists for the discussion. Knox McMil-
lan, a third-year law student, moder-
‘ated the event.

Each panelist gave a short five to
eight minute presentation that con-
‘sidered the Palestinian/Israeli question
from a slightly different perspective
than the other speakers.

Byer used his time to briefly outline
the problem’s historical perspective.
He said that the diaspora, or dispersal
of the Jews in 132 A.D., was a major
part of the Jewish heritage. To this
day, said Byer, Jews are still deeply
affected'by the 1856-year-old event.

’ On the other hand, Byer said the
Palestinians were also displaced from
their land in the 1948 Arab-Israeli
War. The land now known as Israel
was occupied by the Palestinians until
the creation of the Jewish homeland in
1947. The creation of Israel and the

ensuing war effectively uprooted the
Palestinians.

The second speaker, Colvin, said he
wanted to approach the problem from
a human interest perspective. He said
the Jews were isolated in the ghettoes
of European cities until early in the
19th century. He said the Jews wanted
their own country because they had
been second class citizens in every
other country in the world.

Kirgis went next and considered the
problem from a legal perspective. The
disputed areas of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip were acquired by Israel in
the Six-Day War. He said Israel holds
the position, rejected by both the U.N.
and the U.S., that they won the land in
a legal war of self-defense and should
be allowed to keep it.

Stanton, the next speaker, stressed
the Jewish fear of genocide as a driv-
ing force behind Israel’s demand for
secure borders. The Jews believe, he
said, unless they are safe in their own
homeland they will be safe no where.
Therefore, the Jews are determined to
protect their land at all costs.

On the other hand, Stanton said the
Moslems and the Palestinians both
have some claim to Israel’s land. Jeru-
salem is the religious center for not
only Jews and Moslems but also for
Christians. Any solution to the prob-
lem, said Stanton, must address the
problem of religious centering.

Herrick wrapped up the panelist’s
comments by characterizing the
Middle East as a ‘‘negative sum

faculty member to allow him to stay in
the class, but does not formally drop
the class through the registrar’s office,
the student will most likely receive a
failing grade, said Dittman.

Dittman said that he realizes there
may be unavoidable conflicts that
causé students to miss a class.

Because the first day of classes dur-
ing the 1988-89 fall term will fall dur-
ing Rosh Hashanah, some students
may miss classes in order to attend
holy day services. The University Ca-
talog states that the university asks
“all faculty to make any accom-
modations necessary for students’ ob-
servation’ of religious holidays, said
Dittman.

“This might be one area where a
student might not be at the first day of
classes,’’ said Dittman.

Dittman suggested that any students
who think that they might be absent
for the first day of classes talk to the
teacher before they miss the class,
rather than waiting until after the fact.

‘This is where the clause about
prior approval comes in. A student
can call if he misses his plane, or has a
problem at home that prevents him
from getting back in time for clas-
ses,”” he said.

The statement will be added to the
catalog in two specific places: under
‘‘Courses’’ and ‘‘Change of Study,”
said Dittman.

East issues

game’’—a situation where both sides
lose.

He said both sides assume the other
to be evil and believe military might is
the only thing their enemies can
understand.

Following the panelists prepared
statements, the audience was ‘invited
to ask questions.

The panei discussion, organized by
junior Bob Tompkins and first year
law student John Falk, was the second
of it’s kind this year.

Earlier the pair organized a panel to
consider the question of aid to the Ni-
caraguan Contras.

Fewer than 50 people attended last
Thursday’s discussion. Tompkins said
he thinks part of the problem was a
lack of publicity. But he added, **Per-
haps it’s just spring term.”’

Overall, though, he said he was en-
couraged and that he and Falk ‘‘plan-
ned to continue with these events in
the future.””

Audience reaction was also very po-
sitive.

John Kondayon of Lexington said
he thought the conference ‘*was excel-
lent and certainly deserved a bigger
audience.”

He said, ‘‘I wish there were more
conferences like this on matters of
international importance. ”’

Bert Fisher of Falls Church said,
‘‘There wasn’t any political biases [on
the panel]. It was just really a wonder-
ful discussion and I feel very enlight-
ened and lucky to have been here.”’

600 W&L alumni
return to campus

 

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

“Tt will be just like we were young
fellows again,’’ states M. Neely
Young, Sr., °43.

Young and six hundred other
alumni return this weekend to W&L
for class reunions. Beginning today,
the Alumni Association has lectures,
panels, art showings luncheons, and
cocktail parties organized. Alumnus
Dan Balfour, 63, speaks for many
when he said he looks forward to re-
living good memories and parties with
returning friends. A large percentage
of the 10 honored classes return every
five years to the campus.

Beginning on Thursday evening at
8:15 p.m., Philippe Labro, ’58, will
speak in Lee Chapel. Labro is the au-
thor of Foreign Student.

Friday will offer such panel dis-
cussions as ‘‘Dual Career Couples:
The Challenges to Marriage and Fam-
ily Life,’’ ‘‘So You Want To Be An
NFL Replay Official?’’ and ‘‘Is There
Life for an Artist After a Liberal Arts
Education?’’ Each panel features re-
turning alumni.

In addition, members of Kathekon
will give tours of the buildings on
campus, as many have been built and
redone in recent years.

Class pictures, an address from
President John D. Wilson, and an
awards and announcements ceremony
will take place Saturday morning.

Alumni classes will be involved in

 
   

many activities this weekend. On Sat-
urday morning an Alumni Glee Club
Concert will take place. Members of
the class of °58 have challenged the
Varsity Women’s Tennis team to sin-
gles and doubles matches.

The class of ’63 has raised a gift of
approximately $250,000 as a fund for
the school to provide an income to
draw eminent scholars and speakers to
the campus. Not only will the Class of
1938 celebrate their banquet as they
used to in 1930s style in Doremus
Gym, but they also warn of a surprise
they have in store for the campus on
Saturday morning.

Young recalls alumni weekend was
a small affair in years past. He said
when his father was the first secretary
for the Alumni Association in the
1930s, his mother would serve
homemade ham biscuits and potato sa-
lad in the dining hall, the present
bookstore.

Gray Castle, '58, a frequent visitor
to W&L, thinks the people who come
back are what make a reunion, the
program is secondary. Each class
takes the opportunity to have a ban-
quet and reminisce over old times and
discuss years since graduating.

The class of 1963 has organized a
notebook of pictures from their senior
year. It now contains a letter from
each class member describing what
he’s done since graduation.

E. Ross Kyger said, renewing old
friendships, visiting former profes-
sors, and enjoying Virginia at this
time of year is what he looks forward
to this weekend.

Adopt-A-Freshman needs ‘siblings’

 

By Jennifer Bandrowski
Staff Reporter

 

Last summer, the freshman women
received letters from a ‘big sister’’ at
W&L. Their big sisters contacted
them during the first weeks of school
to answer questions or to help with
problems.

Next fall, both freshman men and
women will have the benefit of an
older sibling through the expanded
**Adopt-A-Freshman’’ program.

The program was originally desig-
ned for females ‘‘because women
didn’t have the same advantages as the
males, for example, through a big
brother in a fraternity,’’ said Mary
Alice McMorrow of the Freshman
Orientation Committee.

**Kara Cunningham and I had the
idea and went through the administra-
tive stuff. I was involved with other
parts of Freshman Orientation, and
Kara basically put it [Adopt-A
Freshman] all together.”’

“*Last year’s program was very
successful. Some even had three big
sisters so it worked out really well.”’

Cunningham is in France this term

so this year Brooke Jarabek, Kevin
Nash and McMorrow are in charge.

MeMorrow explained the decision
to include males. ‘‘Before we thought
with such a large majority of the males
going through rush, that took care of
it. This year we decided that guys
need help too and need that introduc-
tion.”

Students may choose a freshman of
either sex. ‘‘So far, the trend has been
that girls have been wanting little sis-
ters and guys have been wanting little
brothers, or else they show no pref-
erence,’’ Jarabek said.

‘*There’s been a bigger response
from the girls, especially the freshman
girls who know the benefits of a big
sister.”

Participating students must write
“two letters per younger sibling dur-
ing the summer,’’ Jarabek said. There
may be some doubling up unless more
people decide to participate.

A picnic will be held ‘‘before the
football game the first Saturday,”
McMorrow said. ‘‘Hopefully all of
the upperclassmen will have arrived
by then so nobody's left out. Basica-
lly, the year starts that day because it’s
the first past Orientation Day.”’

The picnic ‘‘is something where
you can get together with upperclass-
man friends,’’ Jarabek said. ‘‘It will
help to unite the upperclassmen and
freshmen and promote school spirit
and unity.””

The relationship ends ‘‘at a point
left to individual preferences,”’
McMorrow said.

‘‘Hopefully, through the year the
older sibling will be there with an-
swers to questions,’’ Jarabek said.

‘‘Last year, most of it was done
over the summer,’’ McMorrow said.
‘People really need to sign up
now...it’s not too late to get on the
bandwagon.”’

‘‘We definitely need more students
interested in little brothers,’’ Jarabek
said. ‘Almost all of the Early Admis-
sion students are done, except for a
few more males who still need older
siblings. We honor special requests
based on student interests, sports, and
geographic location.”’

Older siblings will receive letters
with the name and address of their
freshman in June.

**T think it’s a really good program
and it helps out the freshmen a lot,”’
Jarabek said.
 

 

OPINION
Changes

This weekend is W&L’s annual Alumni Weekend, an opportunity
for graduates of the university to return to Lexington, the scene of
their collegiate exploits, and visit with classmates and professors.

Inevitably, alumni compare the institution of today with the one
they knew, and find the current one lacking. This is simply a fact of
reunions. Nothing can ever live up to the glorified impressions of
W&L which alumni carry in their minds. Such is the beauty of
selective memory.

Although the alumni will find many facets of W&L life to be the
same, many changes have occurred since the graduation of the clas-
ses of 1938, 1943, 1948, 1953, 1958, 1963, 1968, 1972, 1978 and
1983.

The most obvious and significant of those changes is the inclusion
of women in the student body. Many of these alumni were probably
opposed to the advent of coeducation, thinking that the admission of
women would forever alter the character of the university they re-
membered. This is in fact what has happened—whether the new
character of W&L is preferable to the old is a matter of much de-
bate, not to be soon completed.

 

But what of the other changes which returning alumni may ob-
serve? These may not necessarily be connected to the presence of
women as students here, although arguments may be made both
proving and disproving the coed connection. Men who were stu-
dents before the demise of the dress code may still see coats and ties
worn by the current generation, but no freshmen wear beanies. That
tradition has been but a fond memory for years. Depending on an
alumnus’s year of graduation, he will notice many new buildings on
campus. The most recent of the reunion classes will find Gaines Re-
sidence Hall the newest of the additions; in fact, all of the alumni
will have the opportunity to tour Gaines. Members of some classes
may be seeing the University Library for the first time; others may
be unfamiliar with the renovations of the Gilliam Admissions
House, the Morris House, and the Reeves Center. Warner Center
will be a change from the Doremus Gymnasium complex frequen-
ted by classes before the 1970's. The five-star Generals of the Class
of 1938 will find Howe, Parmly and duPont halls to be changes
from the campus they knew, and many more of the returnees will
find a renovated Commerce School and larger University Center.

These architectural additions are a few of the physically obvious
changes which the alumni may discover upon their arrival in Lex-
ington. Less apparent are changes in the philosophy and attitudes of
the institution known as Washington and Lee University.

Our proudly-held belief in the Honor System still stands, but be-
gins to show cracks when a student’s word is not accepted by ad-
ministrative offices on campus and area merchants refuse to accept
student checks because of fear that the checks will be returned

Noriega
and his
Panama

MY VIEW
By John Roach

 

 

Since Panama and its military
leader, General Manuel Antonio Nor-
iega, seem to be in the news almost
every day it is probably time to shed
some light on this drug trafficker as
well as U.S. policy towards Panama.

No one is for drug trafficking and
especially no one can support a thug
like Noriega. However, there are big-
ger issues involved in this whole mess
and these have hardly been addressed
by the media.

Noriega is a major drug trafficker
but he is only a minor figure com-
pared to the ring-leader of the drug
trade that flows through Latin Amer-
ica. This kingpin is Fidel Castro and
he has a comrade whose name is Dan-
iel Ortega. They are the major movers
of drugs in the area but hardly anyone
has disclosed this to the American
people.

A Nicaraguan military aide to Um-
berto Ortega, the brother of Daniel as
well as Defense Minister, who defec-
ted last year disclosed to Congress and
the media the huge involvement of the
Ortega brothers and Castro in the drug
trade. Major Roger Miranda’s testi-
mony consisted of stories of Swiss
bank accounts as well as disclosures of
just how deep the communist leaders
of our hemisphere are involved in the
drug trade.

Noriega got involved with these
Marxists and he got caught. The U.S.
is trying to oust this minor player
while we don’t dare accuse the
leaders, Castro and Ortega. Justice is
odd.

I am not trying to minimize Noriega

but simply to show that we are ignor-
ing the other culprits in this case. Nor-
iega’s involvement with Castro and
Ortega becomes more alarming if we
consider the importance of the Pan-
ama Canal.

Noriega represents the same group
of leaders that was supposed to leave,
according to supporters of the Panama
Canal Treaty, if we would only ap-
pease the Panamanian people by giv-
ing them back ‘‘their’’ Canal. Presi-
dent Carter offered this line of reason-
ing to The U.S. Senate, when

he convinced the Senators to ratify the
treaty. Carter believed that as soon as
we returned the Canal to Panama the
people will admire the U.S. and will
also throw out the military dictators.
As recent events in Panama have pro-
ven, President Carter was dead
wrong. The Panamanians still hate the
U.S. and for the most part are in no
hurry to have Noriega leave.

The result of Carter’s giveaway has
placed the Canal within the control of
a man who is a drug trader and associ-
ated with both Fidel Castro and Daniel

Ortega. Panama has moved no closer
to democracy and the Canal is not as
secure as it was ten years ago.
The lessons to be learned here are
quite simple. First, General Noriega
should have become a full-fledged
communist and no one would have ac-
cused him of drug trafficking. Seo-
ond, it was a major mistake to give the
Canal away and President Carter,
along with all the other supporters of
the Panama Canal Treaty, have al-
lowed a potential Soviet puppet con-
trol of a vitally important waterway.

 

stamped ‘‘Insufficient funds‘* during the summer months, when the
Cold Check Committee is not available to cover them.

And what has happened to the speaking tradition? It is no longer a
certainty that a student greets those he passes on campus. A practice
that was once enforced by an ‘‘Assimilation Committee’’ is now
unknown to many students and, worse, ignored by others.

One of the most unique characteristics of W&L, that of the stu-
dent-run campus, is well on its way to becoming another tradition
fallen by the wayside. The EC still has full control of the honor
system, but disciplinary and other matters are no longer controlled
by students. If the Student Affairs Committee has review power
over decisions of the Student Conduct Committee, why bother
keeping the charade of student control? We can no longer claim to
be a self-governing university, and should stop making such asser-
tions.

Another aspect of campus life which alumni may find to have
changed, for better or worse, is the fraternity system. One house,
Zeta Beta Tau, will be reorganized next year. Other houses find
‘themselves ruled by a rush calender developed not by the Inter-
fraternity Council, but by administrative committees. And the
fraternity renaissance program was designed not by the student
members of fraternities, but by the administration.

These are a few of the changes which the returning alumni dis-
cover during their visit to Lexington. But enough of W&L’s trade-
marks—the beautiful campus, historical grounding, faculty dedica-
tion to teaching, and the ability to balance intellectual pursuits with
those of a more Bacchanalian nature—remain as testimony to the
longevity of this institution. Welcome Back, graduates! And may
your visit be as enjoyable as your college years were.

Reader ponders SCC, SAC procedures

To the editors:

This letter is not meant as an incontrovertible
“‘conclusion’’ on this matter; it is meant primarily
to open people’s eyes to what’s going on.

Recently a W&L sophomore (male), upon pro-
vocation (which some consider to be severe) did
the unthinkable: he hit a girl. Of course if you ha-
ven’t heard of the incident, you now will surely
support our movement to send this individual to a
very high-level corrections institute, if not de-
mand that he be tantalized beyond reproach before
an imminent trip to the gallows. My point here is
not humor; this is a serious problem involving
both this case and, as I hope will be shown (if not
by this letter, by other means), with the current
disciplinary system under which we, as students,
are governed.

Last year a freshman was found guilty of shoot-
ing a weapon (the infamous blowgun) into a
crowd of people, unprovoked (by anything other
than that Roanoke fans are too loud or that our
friend is a sore loser), hitting a Dean’s daughter in
the shoulder. He was given one semester’s sus-
pension. :

Also last year, another freshman was beaten in
the face (repeatedly) while being held down by
two other guys. The offender barely escaped the
harsh punishment of two weeks’ social probation.
(I know, it breaks my heart too.)

Meanwhile, our current offender (the male
sophomore), having been ‘‘tooled’’ so to speak
(egged on, teased, whatever...), under extreme
provocation hits a Hollins sophomore in the face
(once). I’m not defending what he did, nor do I
believe in this sort of violence (against male or
female). My point here is to put this incident in
perspective.

Sunday night the Student Conduct Committee
(composed of the presidents and vice presidents of
the four undergraduate classes, plus law school
representatives and a chairman) found him guilty
of a major offense (as expected) and subsequently
expelled him. Given previous cases (at least one)
in which the offender wasn’t provoked, and given
that this student was provoked, this sentence
seems (in fact it glares as being) unreasonably
harsh.

All well and good.

You may not agree with my analysis of this in-
dividual case and its relationship to previous
cases, but I’m sure you'll find these tidbits of in-
formation interesting if not alarming. One week
before the SCC ‘‘hearing,’’ one of the student’s
law school advocates was told by a member of the
SCC that ‘‘they,’’ in so many words, wanted him
to be expelled. ‘‘They’’ can be interpreted either
individually or collectively, but off-the- record in-
formation supports if not confirms this interpreta-
tion, In fact, an SCC member also stated that he
would have taken extreme, violent action had the
girl been his daughter. Do you share these views?
Perhaps you do, but there’s a problem here: you’-
re not a member of the body which ‘‘tried’’ the

case! The student spent a few hours on Sunday
night doing something closer to trying to change a
group of people’s minds that were already made
up than to being heard in a fair-court situation. Is
this right? I hope you don’t think it is.

A second tidbit: this body supposedly ‘‘ig-
nores’’ precedent (previous case decisions) ac-
cording to its guidelines so to treat each case more
‘‘individually.’’ This all sounds nice, but let’s
take a closer look. This ‘‘guideline’’ (or practice)

could also cover up or give room for imbalanced |

decision making. (How about sexist decision mak-
ing?) Our courts of law look to precedent for gui-
dance in their decisions, and yet do we think that
these courts do not view each case individually?
Do we not believe in consistent justice over a
period of time? Why, then do we disallow looking
back at precedent? Some may claim the absence of
‘‘exact-case scenarios,’ but what’s the point? Is
there no such thing as comparative or relative
precedence? Certainly there is.

This afternoon (Tuesday) the SAC (three
professors, two deans and four or five students)
reduced his punishment to one year’s suspension.
At least three members of the SAC indicated de-
finite interest in these SCC ‘‘behaviors,”’ includ-
ing Dean John, Professor Margand, and Brad
Root. Dean John urged me to tell other people
who know these ‘‘details’’ to inform other mem-
bers of the SAC, and Prof. Margand urged simi-
larly on grounds that they would not (or may not)
be informed of these things, i.e.—they wouldn’t
have come up in the hearing! Is there no problem
here?

Some still consider the student’s punishment to
be too harsh; myself, I reserve my opinion on the
matter here because the problem at hand is of a
more universal concern: our student disciplinary
structure. I hope you find, as I do, that there’s
something wrong here. The fact that a body of
students elected largely on a popularity contest
basis has the power (which it’s had for only three
years) to expel a student like this is alarming to
me. Some may argue that the automatic appeal to
the SAC serves as a viable ‘‘check and balance,”’
but let’s take another look. This morning Dean
John told me that especially when there exists a
high degree of uncertainty or doubt in their de-
cision, that the SAC will simply approve whatever
the SCC rules. What we have here is worse than
not having any checks; it’s a token check in the
system. Why doesn’t the SAC hear these cases
first-off? I’m sure there are ‘‘reasons,’’ but what
about these findings about the SCC’s behavior?
As I said before, there’s something wrong here.

Granted, the SAC did reduce the sentence, but
as Prof. Margand indicated, that body itself might
have remained unaware of many crucial circum-
stances had several of us not taken an initiative
and spoken up. Since when should a group of con-
cerned students have to keep an eye on the work-
ings of our disciplinary systems in order to pre-
vent such foul-ups? There’s something wrong
here.

To be honest, I do hope a significant change is .

made in this system, and I encourage you all to

voice your opinions (if you have any), whether '

they be in support of this letter or in opposition to

it. It would be nice to all be on the same side here.

Deeply concerned,

Is W&L honor accepted?

To the Editors:

As students of W&L, we are supposed to act |

within the guidelines of our Honor System as out-
lined over a century ago by General Lee. In re-
turn, the students at W&L expect to have their

word trusted on campus and in the surrounding .

areas. However, it seems that certain members of
the faculty no longer regard a student’s word as
the absolute truth. ;

For example: While attempting to register for
fall classes, I was told that I could not register un-
til I paid my bookstore charge account bill. I then
informed the secretary in the registrar’s office that
I had just paid my bill. She then asked me to show
her a receipt or some sort of proof that I had paid
my bill. I then inquired if my word was not suffi-
cient proof. The secretary then told me that it was
not the registrar’s policy simply to accept the
word of a student in this case.

My question is a very simple one: What right
does the registrar have to simply disregard a stu-
dent’s word as the truth? Is it written somewhere
that the administrative offices of the university are
not covered by the Honor Code? Did General Lee
say, ‘‘students of the university will not lie, cheat
or steal, unless registering for classes,’’?

As W&L students, we should demand that as
long as the honor system exists our word should
be considered the absolute truth under any cir-
cumstances,

Sincerely,
F. Skip Sugarman ’91

Thanks and more thanks

To the Editors:
It feels like I’ve been gone forever, but I’m

back now and have to thank some people who

were so good to me while I was gone.

Thanks, Dean John, for taking care of all the
administrative stuff. Thanks to all my professors
for trying to help me catch- up, to my Psych 180
class for the great card, to all my friends who real-
ly helped keep me going, and to Jamie just for be-
ing there. You all are the best!

Wa&L receives grant

WA&L has received a $750,000 chal-

}* lenge grant from The Christian A.

York toward construction of the uni-
versity’s Center for the Performing

“*This grant constitutes a major sti-

The Executive Committee rejected
White Book Revisions Committee’s
proposed phrase, ‘‘untrustworthy
acts’’ in the Philosophy section of the
White Book. The rejection, however,
is not final until the EC revotes on the
issue in two weeks.

The EC decided to pass over the
phrase when they started reviewing
changes recommended by the re-
visions committee Monday night.

By deciding not to accept it, they
effectively rejected it.

EC Representative Nave said, ‘‘In
law school, we would call this ’void
for vagueness.’ It could mean any-
thing.”

Other EC members disagreed with
the language, but agreed with the con-
cept.
‘I think we’ve had that power [to
hear honor trials on issues other than
lying, cheating, or stealing} all
along,’’ said EC Vice-President Pat
Schaefer.

Next year’s EC President, Christo-
pher deMovellan, picked passages out
of the White Book that supported this
point of view.

In other EC news, Contact, the
International Club and the Political
Review appeared before the EC for
budget reports, and a new club, Field
Hockey, made a budget request.

David McLeod appeared for Con-
tact. He said Contact plans to have

Will Harbison, °87 undergra-
duate, *90 law ‘‘I think it would be
too harsh. I think it would be another
example of the impersonal, bu-
reaucratic direction in which W&L is

 

and especially that it has come in tie
form of a challenge we can use to open
new doors of commitment.”

The Johnson challenge is divided
into three parts. The university
receives one-third of the grant once
the project reaches the 50 percent
point in its funding. In the case of the
Center for the Performing Arts, the
campaign passed the halfway mark in
early December when the university
received $250,000 from the Johnson
foundation.

The second third of the grant will be
awarded once the project is 75 percent
funded and the final third will be paid
on completion of the project.

two more speakers before the year is
out, and will finish with a surplus.

The International Club recently
took a sightseeing trip to Williams-
burg and Busch Gardens, said Jennifer
Spreng. They will finish up the year
on schedule with a cookout and a
farewell party for the exchange stu-
dents.

Greg Dale appeared for the Political
Review. He said they had ‘‘a really
fine issue’’ and about 500 copies
would be distributed next week.

Nicole Liarakos made a budget
request to start a new club, Field
Hockey.

She said there are currently 32 girls
signed up for the club. She expects the
number to rise to 50. Their coach
would be a female law student.

The EC too no action telling her
they would consider the request.

On Tuesday the EC announced
some of the Committee appointments
for next year.

The EC decided David Grove
would be chairman of the SAB and
John Roach would head Contact.

In other committee appointments
Ron Brown and John Symonds will
co-chair the Mock Convention com-
mittee. Brown and Symonds are to
make sure all the Convention’s re-
cords are in order.

Charles Driscoll was appointed
head of the Emergency Loan Commit-
tee, James Rambeau the head of the
Cold Check Committee, and Jun-Ho
Lee the head of the Voting Regula-
tions Board.

 

Do you think a professor should drop a student from
a course if that student misses the first class of the term?

“*Yes, I think they should because a
lot of people who want to get into
classes don’t know until the next week
and miss a whole week of school.’’

perate foot doctor, the great Mag-
gie Smith as his gauchely style-
conscious wife, and Denholm El-
liott as a witheringly snobbish doc-
tor. Great fun.

VMI marches
past W&L lax

VMI wins Lee-Jackson trophy
No. 2 Hobart next for Generals

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

What a difference a year makes.

When the VMI lacrosse team played
host to W&L last spring, the final
score was 15-9, and attackman John
Ware was the Generals’ top scorer.

Saturday, 12 months and a lot of la-
crosse games later, the final score was
again 15-9, and Ware was again the
Generals’ points leader.

But the similarities between the
seasons end there. The 1988 Generals,
unlike their 11-4 predecessors, are
2-10 and losers of their last eight
games, while the 11-3 Keydets can
boast their school’s best lacrosse
season ever,

For both programs, the past 12
months have brought major changes.
VMI, home of the nation’s leading
scorer and the Lee-Jackson Trophy,
can now demand the respect normally
accorded better-than-average lacrosse
teams, while W&L can only hope to
re-group and recover from its worst
record since 1969.

Saturday’s meeting may have been
the first Lee-Jackson Classic, but,
with only a few exceptions, it was
hardly ‘‘classic’’ from W&L’s pers-
pective.

‘*Early on, I think we made a lot of
mistakes,’’ said W&L midfielder
Chris Mastrogiovanni. ‘‘I guess that
was too much to overcome in the
end.”’

Going into the game, the Generals
were looking to shut down VMI at-
tackman David Hope, and for good
reason. Hope came into the game as
America’s leading scorer (50 goals
and 19 assists) and the Michael Jordan
of the Keydet offense.

**We felt that, if we could shut him
down, that would curtail them,’ said
head coach Dennis Daly.

Certain things are always in style. Like tradition .

And, as Hope later admitted, the
Generals effectively took out VMI's
biggest gun. Sophomore all-America
defenseman Reid Campbell blanketed
Hope throughout the afternoon, strip-
ping him of the ball repeatedly and li-
miting the nation’s scoring leader to
only one point, a garbage goal late
when the game was already out of
reach.

“*The game was, in many respects,
played the way we wanted to play it,”’
said Daly. ‘‘The problem was that
their other people rose to the occa-
sion.””

Keydet attackmen John Ancona and
Tim Nolan each scored four goals and
one assist, leading the way for VMI
and filling in for the hapless Hope.
Keydet midfielder Grant Kiehl added
two goals and four assists.

As they had in 10 of their 11 preced-
ing games, the Generals fell behind
early. The Keydets scored four goals
in the game’s first 11 minutes and held
the Generals scoreless until sopho-
more attackman Chris Giblin found
the net with two minutes left in the
first quarter.

Ancona answered less than a minute
later, but Ware scored the first goal of
the second period to again put W&L
within three. The Keydets ran off
three straight to go up 7-2 but were hit
with a procedure penalty with 43-se-
conds left that put W&L a man up and
sent Daly to the last page of the W&L
playbook.

After a timeout, the W&L offense
huddled at the top of the restraining
line to set up lacrosse’s version of
football’s ‘‘water-bucket play.’’: All

five Generals came up firing, but it
was senior midfielder Sandy Harrison
who had the ball and sent it home to
cut the difference to four, 7-3, at half-
time.

In the second half, four penalties in
the first nine minutes led to only one

that countered an early third-quarter
goal by Nolan and made the score 8-4
with six minutes left in the period.

VMI middie Tom Spivey scored
less than a minute later to put the
Keydets back up by five, but goals by
Mastrogiovanni and Giblin cut the
margin to three, 9-6, late in the third
quarter.

But three was as close as it got.

consecutive national championships in
a team sport by winning their eighth
straight Division IT title in 1987.

Hobart lacrosse is having a down
year in 1988, however. The Statesmen
are only 6-1 against D-III opponents
and are only ranked second in the
country.

 

By W. Patrick Hinely/W&L

Hobart’s only D-III loss came in
overtime at top-ranked Ohio Wesley-
an. The Statesmen’s 9-4 overall re-
cord includes a 16-8 defeat by Syra-
cuse in the Carrier Dome, a 15-14
season-opening loss to C.W. Post and
a 17-15 loss at Cornell.

The only national champion D-III
lacrosse has ever known, Hobart lost
outstanding players to graduation in
1987 but has since seen last year’s
bench develop into a balanced group
of superb starters.

The 1988 Statesmen are led on
offense by all-America attacker Tom
Gravante (44 goals and 15 assists in 13
games) and attackman Jim Bardwell
(25 and 21).

The Hobart defense is ‘‘pressure-
oriented, big and very athletic,’’ ac-
cording to Daly, who said senior Mi-
chael Sheehan is the Statesmen’s top
defender. Their starting goalie is jun-
ior Shawn Trell, who had a 6-3 record
in nine games after recording 117
saves and allowing only 84 goals.

No. 3 ranked netters
handily defeat Emory

 

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

As the W&L men’s tennis team
winds its season to a close, the Gen-
erals find themselves in excellent con-
tention for a bid to the Division II
National Championships, to be held in
Lexington May 16-22.

The Generals helped assure their
spot by upping their record to 13-7
with a win against Emory University
this past weekend.

Team members flew to Atlanta,
Georgia, on Friday in order to prepare
for their Saturday afternoon contest
against the Emory Eagles. As of April
28, the Eagles had been ranked No. 11
in the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches’
Association (ITCA) poll. W&L went
into the contest ranked No. 3 in the
nation, behind No. 1 University of Ca-
lifornia at Santa Cruz and No. 2
Swarthmore, in that same poll.

Earlier in the week head coach Gary
Franke said that Emory was ‘‘the kind
of team that could beat you’’ if it were
given a chance. He went on to say that
the Eagles had lost to several Div. III
Top 20 teams in close contests. There
would be no upsets on this day,
though, as the Generals won the meet-
ing 8- 1.

In singles action, W&L’s No. |
player, junior Bobby Matthews,
defeated Emory’s Jimmy Strauss 6-2,
6-3. Strauss had been ranked No. 11
in an April 29 ITCA poll for singles
players. Matthews was ranked No. 6
in the same survey.

Junior Robert Haley, playing at the
No. 2 position for the Generals and
rated No. 15 in the nation, needed
four tie-breaker points in the first set
before defeating Gavin O’Connell 7-6
(4), 6-1.

Ranked No. 51 nationally, W&L
senior co-captain David McLeod lost
his lengthy No. 3 singles match
against upstart Andy Fine at the wire
7-5, 2-6, 7-6 (5). Sophomore John
Morris, playing at No. 4 for the Gen-
erals, defeated Mike Beck 7-5, 6-1.

At No. 5, senior co-captain Chris
Wiman battled back after losing the

first set to win against Brian Harris

6-7 (5), 6-1, 6- 3. Bill Meadows, a
freshman playing No. 6 for W&L,
beat Chris Walser 6-3, 7-6 (4).

The Generals will finish up their
season Saturday afternoon on the up-
per courts against Hampton Institute.
After completing that match, W&L’s
playoff picture will rest in the hands of
a simple telephone call.

The Tournament Selection Commit-
tee’s conference call to select the eight
teams that will vie for the national title
will be held on Sunday.

Franke said that ‘‘there is a toss-up
between 2nd through 4th, and there
are several teams on the bubble for
that eighth spot.’’ As a committee
member, Franke has his work cut out
for him. A look at the team standings
in the ITCA poll will show why.

UC-Santa Cruz, with their un-
defeated D-III record, have a virtual
lock on the No. 1 seed for the week-
end. There is a tie-up, however, be-
tween Swarthmore, currently No. 2,
the No. 3 Generals and Washington
College, who is No. 4. W&L played
Swarthmore and Washington on the
same weekend, suffering a loss to
Washington (4-5) while getting a win
over Swarthmore (7-2). '

Swarthmore beat weciitaia,
however, so the Generals score
ing points with this indirect win.
These indirect points are also holding
the Generals back. Early in thd
season, W&L lost to Penn State, who,
later fell to Swarthmore. It is practicas
lly a dead tie between the three teams. } :

“It all depends on how you score
[the results},”” said Franke. Three
different systems yield three _—
rankings. i

Franke will have no easier time fi
guring out which teams will fill out the!
second four. Kalamazoo, the defend-}
ing national champs, seems to have a?
lock on the No. 5 position, but it is UP}
for grabs after that. UC-San Diego,} ;
Clairmont (Calif.), University of the}
South, Whitman College (Wash.), i
University of Rochester, Emory, andé

Gustavus Adolphus (Minn.) all have af
chance at a tournament bid. {

Gilbert &

Sullivan

opens in Lee Chapel
Monday night

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

The W&L/Mary Baldwin produc-
tion of Patience, the Gilbert and Sul-
livan operetta about a nineteenth cen-
tury battle of the sexes, will debut
Monday night at 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel.

The operetta, W&L’s third Gilbert
and Sullivan production with Mary
Baldwin in four years (last spring
members of the Glee Club sang in a
Roanoke opera company production
of The Student Prince), is a satire of
the aestheticism movement of the late
nineteenth century.

The story centers around a flaky
**fleshy poet’’ named Bunthorne who
thinks he loves everyone, the perfect
‘‘idyllic poet’? Grosvenor who has
always loved Patience and wants to
marry her, and the picture of purity
Patience who has been told that love is
totally unselfish and that she must
marry Bunthorne.

Mary Baldwin senior Kathy Als-
brooks will sing the title role with
support from W&L seniors John
Starks and Lance Rae as Grosvenor
and Bunthorne. All three leads are

veterans of the spring productions
each having performed in two of the
three operettas (Iolanthe, Princess
Ida andPatience) presented since
1985.

‘Patience is a great show and this
production has alot of talented people
who are good and fun to work
with,‘‘said Alsbrooks. ‘‘They have
made being in the show a great expe-
rience.”’

W&L seniors Tom O’Brien and Mi-
chael Herrin will sing the roles of the
Duke and the Major while Mary
Baldwin professor Stevens Garlick
will sing the part of the Colonel. Mary
Baldwin singers Dorene Dillon, Heidi
Rundt and Sheresa Perry as well as
Rita Alvis, who will make her Gilbert
and Sullivan debut as the domineering
Lady Jane, will anchor the chorus as
the rapturous maidens. Mary Baldwin
music professor Robert Allen will ac-
company the operetta.

The production will run in Lee
Chapel May 9 and 10. Tickets are
$2.50 for students and $3 for adults
while Senior citizens can attend for
$2. Both performances are open to
members of the W&L community free
of charge. For reservations or more
information call 463-8861.

National tennis tournament comes to W&

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

After almost nine months of prep-
aration, W&L is ready to play host to
the Division III Men’s National Ten-
nis Championships beginning Sunday,
May 15 and running through to May
22.

The championship is also the second
athletic event—the first being the Lee-
Jackson Lacrosse Classic on April
30—in which the university will hold
an event that provides an opportunity
for the students and the Lexington
community to come together.

According to Tournament Director
Gary Franke, preparations for the
tournament began as early as last Sep-
tember.

“‘We submitted our budget to the
NCAA last May,”” said Franke, who
is also the head coach of the men’s
tennis team that is seeded No. 2 in the
championships. ‘‘We were then selec-
ted as the site. The NCAA then goes

over the budget and we receive back
the approved budget from the NCAA.
When I got back [to school] in Sep-
tember, I started working on this tour-
nament.”’

Franke said most of the work went
into organizing and obtaining or ‘‘hus-
tling’’ volunteers for the several sub-
committees that needed to be formed.
Each subcommittee is responsible for
a certain part of the tournament.
Franke set up individual subcommit-
tees for housing, information, regis-
tration, meals, site preparation and
maintenance, public relations, tro-
phies, hospitality, printing, court dec-
orations and T-shirts.

**Coach Franke is doing most of the
work,”’ said W&L Athletic Director
Bill McHenry. ‘‘He deserves all the
credit. He’s doing most of the leg
work.”

In its preparations the university
had both the lower and upper courts
resurfaced. The lower courts were
completed last fall, but, because of the

onset of cold weather, the work on the
upper courts was delayed until this
spring.

Franke, however, raised the money
for the 14 new umpire chairs. In 1985,
when W&L also played host to the
tournament, platforms were used in-
stead of umpire chairs. By calling
former tennis players, alumni and
coaches of W&L, Franke was able to
secure enough money to pay for the
new chairs.

Unlike the Lee-Jackson Classic,
which was billed as a community- uni-
fying event, the tennis championship
is not being labeled as an effort to
bring Lexington and the university
together. This does not mean that
community attendance and support is
not welcome.

“I think there’s some real tennis
fans that will come out,’’ said
McHenry. ‘‘I don’t think John Q.
Public will be interested, but if you

Contact sponsors Abrams’ speech in Lee Chapel tonight

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Elliott Abrams, the U.S. assistant
secretary of state for inter-American
affairs and a key figure in last sum-
mer’s Iran-Contra hearings, will
speak on U.S. policy toward Central
America tonight at 7:30 in Lee
Chapel.

Abrams is expected to discuss U.S.
foreign policy and the narcotics trade
in Latin America and the Carribean,
according to a State Department
spokeswoman.

The Reagan administration’s point

man on the Contra aid issue since July
of 1985, Abrams has made frequent
appearances before congressional
committees looking into U.S. support
of the Nicaraguan Resistance.

Abrams was also criticized by the
report of the Tower Commission on
the Iran-Contra affair. The report said
Abrams and Lt. Col. Oliver North
were involved in efforts to open up a
southern front in the war in Nicaragua
at a time when official U.S. in-
volvement was illegal, according to
the Los Angeles Times.

Testifying in June before the con-
gressional committees investigating
the Iran-Contra affair, Abrams admit-

ted to having misled Congress in ear-
lier testimony about Contra fundrais-
ing activities and to making false
statements about the efforts of North,
according to the Washington Post.

Abrams told Congress he made ‘‘a
great mistake’’ when he misled the
Senate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence six months earlier by failing to
disclose his role in the solicitation of
$10 million for the Contras from the
nation of Brunei.

Abrams said he was ‘‘caught in a
bind’’ because he did not have the
permission of Secretary of State
George Schultz to discuss the matter.

In other testimony, Abrams went

Sororities may rush here
during Winter Term 1989

By Pat Lopes™
Staff Reporter

 

Senior, junior and sophomore
women may face a sorority rush dur-
ing the 1989 Winter Term, when local
chapters of national sororities may be
established at W&L.

According to Leroy C. Atkins, as-
sociate dean of student, a winter rush
is part of a recently drafted schedule
of events leading to the founding of
sororities on this campus.

Local alumnae and representatives
of nationally based sororities would
conduct rush.

Spring rush for women in the
freshman class would follow the win-
ter rush. The spring rush would be
conducted by women who joined the
sororities during the winter.

Rushes are part of a tentative sched-
ule of events.

“All of this is hypothetical, alth-
ough it is reasonable to assume that 95
women would be enough to form a
group of a few sororities,’’ Atkins
said.

The 95 women are those who signed
a survey recently submitted to the ad-
ministration. Thirty-two juniors, 32
sophomores and 31 freshmen agreed
that they were strongly interested and
would participate in a sorority system.

The survey submission does not
guarantee that W&L sororities will be
established. It did prompt the adminis-
tration to seriously consider sorori-
ties. The establishment of a sorority
advisory committee of faculty, admin-
istration and students is planned.

Choosing specific sororities would
be one of the first responsibilities of
the committee. Fifteen national organ-
izations have already expressed inter-
est in W&L. Atkins said question-
naires will be sent to all 26 national
sororities.

The advisory committee will review
the questionnaires, and invite six sor-
orities to make presentations at W&L.
The committee will shoot for three
final choices.

The committee's decisions would be
the first material actions on the soror-
ity question since women expressed
interest in the Greek system three
years ago. This year, the survey final-
ly kicked the administration into ac-
tion.

The group that compiled the survey
was driven by the beneficial aspects of
national sororities. Junior Erin Cosby,
who helped collect signatures, said
sororities are more than a social out-
let.

Sororities will fill the deficit of
leadership opportunities for women at
W&L, said Cosby. She said that in
addition to campus leadership posi-
tions open to everyone, men also have
an abundance of opportunities offered
by the fraternity system. Women, on

the other hand, are offered only 11

Trident positions, for 400 students.

Cosby also pointed out that sorori-
ties will provide scholarships and
alumni networking, which will help
secure jobs for members after gradua-
tion. The benefits of sororities will
come at a cost to women. Cosby esti-
mated $100 pledge dues and $300
yearly dues.

Despite the benefits there is strong
opposition to the establishment of sor-
orities at this time.

“I simply want the university and
the interested women not to rush into
something that will put us right where
we are with the fraternities. We still
have lessons to learn from that situa-
tion,’’ said Christopher de Movellan,
incoming EC President.

de Movellan is concerned with the
physical, as well as spiritual, state of
fraternity houses. Unresolved rush
and pledge controversy also prompted
him to oppose sororities at this time in
speeches to President John D. Wilson,
the Alumni Board and the faculty.

Concerning actual houses, Cosby
said, ‘‘Sororities are not fraternities.
The houses are not an essential part of
the sorority system ... Auburn doesn’t
have houses but they have a strong
sorority system.’’ She said alcohol is
not normally allowed in sorority
houses.

Purchasing houses won't even be
considered for three or four years,
Atkins says. The Women’s Center and
the Gaines Gate House would be used
for meetings.

‘‘National sororities provide a lot
more counseling,’’ he added.

“*There wouldn’t be that kind of un-
restrained adolescent behavior,’’ he
said, referring to fraternity houses.

Destroying class unity is also a chief
concern. ‘‘] am not sure that there are
enough options open to women to
keep sororities from doing the same
thing to the women that the fraternities
have done to the men. Namely, sorori-
ties may begin to separate the women
into different factions before they
have some class unity,”’ de Movellan
said.

“If you look at sororities, the whole
idea behind them is to take a large
group of women and break them down
into smaller units,’’ said Freshman
Mary Hampson. ‘‘The sheer fact that
this issue is causing so much tension
and division among the W&L women
should be an indication that it would
not be a unifying factor for a while un-
til there’s more agreement. ”’

Hampson, Blair Simmons and Si-
mone Schonenberger, also freshmen,
spoke to Wilson and Kenneth Ruscio,
assistant dean of students, concerning
sororities at W&L. Alienation of indi-
vidual women is another of their con-
cerns.

“Once you create a structure to be

in, you create one to be out_of,”’ said
Hampson. She is concerned about
women who are not accepted into a
sorority, despite efforts to join one.

Although W&L men have been
dealing with this dilemma for years,
Hampson feels being left out will be
especially severe for women. They
will have to deal with feelings of rejec-
tion from women. In addition, these
women will have to adjust to a pre-
dominantly male school, which has
just recently become co-ed .

“I’m not opposed to sororities, I’m
opposed to sororities now,’’ Hampton
said. She suggests that more women
get involved in sports, SAC, Amnesty
International, publications and other
campus activities.

Until sororities are established,
these activities will provide leadership
opportunities for women, said Hamp-
ton. These activities promote unity
within each class and _ between
different classes of women. Also, the
organizations often include all stu-
dents who express interest in them, in
addition to promoting relations be-
tween men and women.

de Movellan’s and Hampton's
efforts to suspend the founding of sor-
orities will not stop the schedule
already being implemented; but, their
efforts have cautioned the administra-
tion. \

‘*The effect that they are having is
to make sure the process goes slowly
and carefully,’’ said Atkins.

**When you got 100 that want soror-
ities, 100 that don’t and another 200
that aren’t sure, what do you think? If
you got enough people that are inter-
ested they should have that opportun-
ity,’” he said.

The W&L community outside of the
administrative offices have been left in
the dark concerning sororities. Mary
Alice McMorrow and Vanessa Hart-
man, both freshmen dorm counselors,
were concerned with the rumors ‘‘fly-
ing around”’ the dorms.

They spoke with Wilson, Ruscio,
Dean of Students Lewis John and
several EC representatives. Both
women feel that there is a need for a
general information meeting for
women, similar to the meeting held
during the 1987 Winter Term.

Explanations of eating clubs, local
sororities and national sororities were
presented to the women. Women in
the freshmen class, some women in
the upperclasses, and most men were
unable to attend the meeting. Rumors
and confusion circulating in the stu-
dent body are partially based on a lack
of information about these organiza-
tions.

‘Questions about how it would start
are small compared to what it would
be in the long run,’’ said McMorrow.
**There are a lot of other questions
that people are not well informed
about.”’

out of his way to distance himself
from private efforts to raise money for
the Contras, according to the Post.
But Abrams did admit to meeting with
a representative from Brunei in Lon-
don in August of 1986 and offering the
‘‘gratitude’’ of the president and se-
cretary of state in exchange for a con-
tribution of $10 million to the Con-
tras.

Abrams also testified that Schultz
had asked him to ‘*monitor’’ North in
Sept. of 1985. However, he told the
Iran-Contra committees he had since
reported incorrect information to
Congress because he had failed to get
all the facts on fundraising and supply

“‘Human Rights Now!”’ will be
the emphasis of a week-long series
of events planned by W&L’s stu-
dent chapter of Amnesty Interna-

Senior Night, May 25, kicks off
1988 graduation ceremonies

 

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

In just 13 days the class of 1988 will
begin the ceremonies involved in
graduation.

Wednesday, May 25, Senior Night
will recognize and award members of
the class in Lee Chapel. Senior class
president, Mike Henry will speak.
The evening’s guest speaker will be
Prof. J. Davis Futch, If. A reception
will follow at the Alumni House.

The Senior class party on Monday,
May 30 will begin in the afternoon.
This year’s party will be held at the Pi
Kappa Alpha river house as opposed
to the usual location at Zollman’s Pa-
vilion. Henry anticipates the party will
be better than previous ones because
of the location, live entertainment,
and the earlier date.

Henry comments that they are try

ing to contact members to contribute
to the class gift for the school.

Baccalaureate Service on Wednes-
day, June | will begin at 11:00 a.m.
President John D. Wilson and guest
speaker Philippe Labro, °58, will ad-
dress the service. A luncheon spon-
sored by the Alumni House will fol
low on the Front Lawn.

Seniors may pick up their caps and
gowns starting Monday, May 25,
through Thursday, June 2 in the book
store. A refundable deposit of $35 is
required.

On Thursday, June 2, the Military
Commissioning Ceremony will take
place at 9:00 a.m. in Lee Chapel.
Brigadier General Thomas P. O’Brien
will address the ceremony.

Commencement Exercises begin at
11:00 a.m. on the Front Lawn. Presi
dent Wilson and Executive Committee
President Brad Root will speak. Each

graduate will receive a sheepskin

parchment dipluina. W&L is one of
eight institutions in the country to still
give this type of diploma. Professional
framing is suggested to avoid its being
damaged.

Root, in anticipation of graduation,
comments on the unique nature of his
class. He feels the class is **marked by
a true bond of friendship that trans-
cends any number of cliques and div
isions such as fraternities, "’

Both Henry and Root commented
on the nature of their graduation for
the last all male class. Henry states,
‘*We accept coeducation at W&L; we
simply leave appreciating the former
unique nature of a single-sex school."’

Root comments that the class is
“not so sad that we're leaving some
thing so different from what we knew
four years ago; we're sentimentally
unified and sad to leave W&L."* Root
suggested that his class looks forward
all the privileges of alumni.

The Ring-tum Phi, May 12, 1988

 

ororities

The question of whether sororities will be colonized at W&L has
been discussed, debated, and argued since 1985, when the first
women undergraduate students were admitted.

Recently, the move to form sororities obtained new momentum
with the circulation of a petition among female students calling for a
sorority’ rush during the 1988-89 academic year. Ninety-five
women signed the petition, representing 26 percent of the total fe-
male undergraduate enrollment.

It seems the administration supports the efforts of those women to
develop a sorority system, and in fact will help form a sorority ad-
visory committee of faculty, students, and administration. That
committee will develop plans for the rush next year after determin-
ing which national sororities will be allowed to colonize at W&L. If
their schedule is implemented, W&L will have sororities in place
before the graduation of the class of 1989, the first class to include
women as freshmen. '

However, in the survey conducted by Professor David Novack’s
sociology class during February registration, more than 50 percent
of the women surveyed said they were opposed to having sororities
at W&L.

Thus, if sororities are formed on our campus by one quarter of
the women students, more than half of the female undergraduate
population will be unhappy.

Sororities will divide the women of the university into distinct
factions, resulting in a lack of unity for the female student popula-
tion as a whole. Do the women really want to do that, while anti-
coeducation sentiment still exists and is regularly expressed? The
women of W&L will find more strength in numbers than in sorori-
ties.

Some supporters of sororities claim that such organizations are
necessary to provide leadership opportunities for women. Are the
existing leadership positions not sufficient? Women are represented
in nearly every campus organization and are leaders of many.

An undergraduate woman will sit on the Executive Committee
next year.

The chair of the 1989 Fancy Dress Ball is a woman. One of the
chairs of the Student Recruitment Committee is a woman.

Women’s sports teams are developing more rapidly than ever ex-
pected, and have already claimed Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence championships.

This year, two women were inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa,
the society honoring leadership and academic achievement.

The women of next year’s university residential staff include the
head resident assistant, one of the co-head dormitory counselors, an
assistant head dormitory counselor, and many, many staff mem-
bers.

The secretary of the 1988 Mock Democratic Convention was a
woman.

One of the co-editors of this newspaper is a woman, in addition to
the female editorial page editor. Next year, 7he Ring-tum Phi will
have a triumvirate of female editors. The Calyx has a female co-
editor. A woman is the news director of WLUR, with a female as-
sistant news director.

A woman will serve as president next year of W&L’s chapter of
Alpha Phi Omega, the national service fraternity. The president of
the University Chorus is a woman. Three women hold offices in the
Women’s Chorus.

Such a list is not comprehensive, but should imply the extent to
which women have participated in and led campus activities. The
Interfraternity Council is one of the few campus groups which does
not have female members.

Why does W&L need sororities after all? Do we need them as
friendship clubs for women? With the small number of students at
this school, and particularly the small number of women, it is rela-
tively easy to know nearly everyone. How would sororities contri-
bute to the ability of women to meet each other?

Will sororities help provide more social outlets for women? Tri-
dent is in its second year of sponsoring a spring semi-formal party
and sponsored a winter term social event as well. Will sororities do
any better?

Many women of W&L also attend fraternity parties as alternative
social activities. Will members of sororities take advantage of the
same opportunity for socializing? If they do, will a Greek system
develop wherein particular sororities socialize primarily with parti-
cular fraternities? That situation is likely, and will only succeed in
further factionalizing the female students of W&L.

Although larger schools may be able to support sorority systems
with one quarter of the female students participating, W&L cannot.
The university simply does not have enough female students enrol-
led to supply a sorority system, and the women who are here might
better be advised to develop and maintain a group identity, rather

than rashly implementing a system which will divide the women
into factions. - MMP

Investigative reporting, as Sbar does it,
covers the issues from men to Mom

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

Recently, I received a_ petition
signed by every living member of Gil-
liam Dormitory. The petition deman-
ded that I do something about the
‘‘disgusting odors’’ emanating from
my room which have ‘‘permeated”’
the entire building. ‘*Until something
is done,’’ the petition continued, ‘‘the
women on the fourth floor are on a
hunger strike.’’ I ignored the petition
because I figured that the women on
the fourth floor could stand to lose a
little weight. However, my attitude
soon changed after I received notice
from the health department declaring
my room ‘‘unfit to be habitable for the
Puerto Rican Iguana.’’ At that point I
realized I would have to take drastic
action—I had to do my laundry.

As I waited for the spin cycle to fin-
ish on my 30th load I decided to catch
up on current events with a copy of
theUSA Today that I found in the
trash. A major issue was the recently
published book by former White
House chief of staff, Donald Regan.
Regan revealed that the president’s
major policy decisions are influenced
by Methulsa, the deranged, but sexy,
astrologer. Regan also implied that the
president determines foreign policy
with a roulette wheel. I had to admire
Regan’s skills as an investigator that
he could discover interesting facts
like, ‘‘In moments of stress, he (the
President) sometimes leaned forward
in his chair and let his arms dangle
loosely between his knees.’’ I was so
inspired by Regan’s investigation that
I resolved to try my own hand in the
exciting and dangerous world of In-
vestigative Reporting.

My first subject of investigation was
the recent proposal to revise the
Honor Code Pledge from ‘‘I will not
lie, cheat, or steal,”’ to ‘I will not lie,
cheat, steal, or commit untrustworthy
acts.’’ After many nights of research,
interviews, and information payoffs I
cracked the case. Here are the cold
facts. The ‘‘untrustworthy acts’’
clause was invented by power- hungry
fascists on the Executive Committee.
These EC fascists plan to use the ‘‘un-
trustworthy acts’’ addition as a loo-
phole to expel college undesirables for
honor violations like starting rumors,
bad table manners, body odor and
drinking light beer. Within the next
five years the fascist faction hopes to
increase its power base by acquiring a
few territories in Latin America, put-
ting EC members in the Senate, pay-
ing EC members $200,000 a year and
guaranteeing them a life-long pension.

These recently uncovered plots
bring up deeper questions. Questions
which penetrate to the very core of the
Washington and Lee ideology—the
concept of the W&L Southern gentle-
man. In order to uncover some of the
misconceptions and illusions on the
Southern gentleman subject I have
complied a list of the eight most com-
mon definitions:

*Southern bigot: ‘‘A Southern
gentleman is a superior member of the
human race because he was born south
of the Mason Dixon line. He con-
sumes huge quantities of Jack Daniels
whisky and hates minority groups
such as the Yankees.”’

*Northern bigot: ‘‘A Southern
gentleman is a semi-illiterate, beer-
swilling, tobacco-spitting psychopath
who drives a pick-up truck and enjoys
torturing animals in his free time. His
idea of a cultural experience is to
watch The Dukes of Hazzard.”’

*Militant Feminist:‘‘A Southern
gentleman is a chauvinist who opens
doors for females and expects sexual

favors in return."’

Gentlemen's Quarterly (GQ)
magazine: ‘‘A Southern gentleman is
a male who wears a tuxedo whenever
he leaves his house.”’

eAnn Landers: ‘‘A Southern
gentleman is a member of the male
species who has realized that women
are superior.”

*Playboy magazine: ‘‘A Southern
gentleman is any heterosexual male
who has lost his virginity. ”’

*Washington and Lee University:
**A Southern gentleman is a male (or
female) who conducts himself honor-
ably in everything he does. Honor is
defined in a boring white book distri-
buted to freshmen at the beginning of
the school year.”’

Me: **A Southern gentleman is any
life form which follows the honorable
traditions of General Lee’s distin-
guished horse, Traveller.*’

I recommend the readers spend a
good percentage of their lives meditat-
ing on the ramifications, truths, and
meaning of the honor code and the
Southern gentleman. In the meantime,
we must move on to other frontiers of
investigation.

My next subject of investigation is
one of my recent articles. Two weeks
ago I wrote on my spring break expe-
rience. In one part of the article I de-
scribed how my family members
treated me with unprecedented respect
owing to their fear of showing up in an
article in The Ring-tum Phi. To exhi-
bit my point I portrayed a scene in
which my mother asked me to do the
dishes but changed her mind because
she remembered my ‘tendency for
gross exaggerations and envisioned an
article in which I portrayed her as a
power-hungry family dictator who
forces me to cook and clean all
break...”

But the Phi misprinted my statement
which came out to the effect of ,‘‘my
mom, remembering her tendency as a

®

id
gross power-hungry family dictator
who forces me to cook and clean all
break...’’ The reader can plainly see,
how the omission of a few choice
words created an entirely different
statement from the one I intended.,
The question that remains to be an-
swered is whether or not this omission’
was an administrative plot to upset my,
mother in the hopes that she would
withdraw me from school and place
me in an insane asylum. My in-;

vestigation indicates that there was an

administrative Phi conspiracy to get
me out of Washington and Lee. Be-!
fore the reader makes up his mind I
feel obligated to reveal some state-
ments on the matter.

eWriter’s (my) vindication of self:
** | admit that I have a deranged sense
of humor, but even I don’t think call-
ing my mother a gross dictator is
funny. Furthermore, my mother has
as much in common with a gross dicta-
tor as my dorm room has with cleanli-
ness. (Nothing).”’

¢The Ring-tum Phi editorial state-
ment: ‘‘Mr. Sbar’s allegations that a
recent misprint concerning his mother
was part of a plot to get him out of
W&L is so ludicrous that it is beyond
belief (even from Mr. Sbar). The real,
problem is that Mr. Sbar usually turns
in his articles two hours after deadline
on torn yellow legal paper. His hand-
writing is illegible and he has no
knowledge of current grammar laws.
Furthermore, even though we would
like nothing more than to see Mr. Sbar ,
leave W&L, we would never consider
such a stunt in the realm of reality.’’

I hope readers have enjoyed my |
journey into the province of in- -
vestigative reporting. Anyone who is
interested (preferably attractive fe-
males) is welcome to see me about '
renting my self- produced videotape -
on the do’s and don’ts of hardcore in- .
vestigative reporting.

Alumni Office

To the Editors:

When James M. Davidson Jr., 38, "44L, came
to the Alumni House late Friday afternoon to reg-
ister for his 50th Reunion, his next stop was a re-
ception and dinner that, due to rain, was moved to
the Warner Center. David B. Stuart, the young
local man who was assisting the 50th Reunion par-
ticipant, asked directions to the most convenient
entrance at the gymnasium and inquired about the
facility’s elevator. Mr. Davidson is confined to a
wheelchair.

George Massie, a Washington and Lee senior,
was stationed at the Alumni House Friday after-
noon during registration hours. George was one
of ten members of the Alpha Phi Omega service
fraternity who shared their time with the W&L’s
alumni throughout the weekend. Besides assisting
Mr. Davidson to the gym, George also ran
through the rain affixing notices about the change
in the evening’s activities. He greeted registering

Washington and Lee.

Our reunion weekend was very much a success,
and I believe that one of the most obvious and key
additions was a youthful infusion which the stu-
dent body provided.

Students could be found at Thursday evening’s
assembly in Lee Chapel, when Philippe Labro.
"58, gave the opening address. Members of the
student alumni group, Kathekon, assisted several
panel discussions Friday, led campus tours, and
ushered Saturday morning’s Annual Meeting of
the Alumni Association. Student crews put in
hours of time at the Dining Hall and at various
sites for luncheons and dinners. APO members
volunteered their Saturday evening, assisting Be-
tty Taylor cater the 50th Reunion Banquet for the
Class of 1938. Student singers shared the Lee
Chapel stage Saturday at noon for a well-received
performance of Southern Comfort and the Alumni
Glee Club. And JubiLee, the small women’s en-
semble, entertained a crowd of alumni, faculty,
and students in the Gaines Hall Gatehouse Satur-
day afternoon.

The staff of the Alumni Office is very grateful
to the student body for their participation in the
weekend’s activities. On behalf of the Alumni Of-
fice staff, I would like to express particular thanks
to all members of Kathekon and to the APO mem-
bers, including George Massie, Laura Taylor,
Jane Allen, Steve Ingram, Andy Nixon, Marie
Dunne, Lovell West, Dean Nuckols, Dorothy
Mills and Wendy Wilson. :

We appreciate all of our alumni-in-residence!

Sincerely,
Richard B. Sessoms

Sexism condoned at W&L

To the Editors:

The administration of W&L has sent a disturb-
ing message to the student body: that sexism is to
be condoned.

One has only to look at the school’s disciplinary
record to see the bizarre and distorted set of moral
standards the school sets for its students. When a

alumni and answered their questions about today’s

LETTERS|

 

thanks students for help |

student beat a man while two of his friends held
him down, that student was put on social proba-
tion for two weeks. When a student raped his
date, he was suspended for one semester. Last
month when a student hit his ex-girlfriend once
during an argument, he was expelled. That de-
cision was appealed and he will be allowed to re-
apply after one year.

The University administrators apparently be-
lieved that one man being beaten by three others is
acceptable when compared with a woman being
struck once in a moment of anger. Are women so
revered at W&L? Why then is raping a woman
considered a minor offense?

The students deserve better than the inept and
misguided moral leadership provided by the ad-
ministrators of W&L.

Sincerely,
Katherine Netzer Bunger

‘‘Unauthorized Absence”’

To the Editors:

How appropriate for Professor Colvin’s letter
to appear in the 28 April issue of The Ring-tum
Phi along with the editorial, ‘‘Honor changes.”’

Those individuals who made a commitment to
attend the U.S. Naval Academy Foreign Affairs
Conference and did not keep it, committed an un-
trustworthy act, a subject under review by the
White Book Revisions Committee. No matter that
these individuals missed an opportunity to meet
with fine students at a prestigious institution.
They besmirched the good name and reputation of
General Lee’s college.

A violation of trust? Yes, and also, in military
parlance, subject to the charge of Unauthorized
Absence.

Greetings from W&L

To the Editors:

When I was a senior in high school, I visited
Washington & Lee. The university became my
first choice and my dream. I was extremely im-
pressed by the friendliness shown to me by the
students I passed on campus. Their smiles bright-
ened an otherwise dreary January morning.

This was before I was told about the so-called
Speaking Rule. What’s that you say? Well, ac-
cording to an outmoded idea called tradition,
Washington and Lee students are required to say
‘hello’? to those they pass on campus. Even
someone unknown to him or her? Yes. That’s the
charm of it all. You mean to tell me you haven't
noticed this? That's okay. This year, I haven't
either.

I don’t intend to single out the freshmen, but I
am wondering if they have even been told about
this special privilege consisting merely of a smile
and a brief greeting. The upperclassmen needn't

necessarily pat themselves on the back either.
Traditions are instituted for a reason. Even

though it would hardly be possible to bring back

the concept of wearing a coat and tie to class,

what’s the harm in a smile? 2
Anyone curious about a good description of the |,

Speaking Rule should consult Philippe Labro’s
The Foreign Student Section \', Chapter 5. It was

while reading this that I realized what has been}.

missing on this campus all year.

Thanks to APO from Daley

To the Editors:

The morning of Saturday April 23 was one of
the most incredible I have ever experienced. Lex-
ington High School was the site of the Area 18
Special Olympics Spring Games where more than
thirty mentally retarded athletes competed in track
and field events.

I am writing to publicly commend the Washing-
ton and Lee service organization Alpha Phi
Omega. Nine APO members showed up to help
with the events—some timed the runners, some

recorded the times, some measured accomplish- | ,

ments in the field events, and some helped hand
out the awards to the competing athletes. They
provided this service with genuine enthusiasm. In
all honesty, without the APO members the morn-
ing would not have been as successful. APO is to
be congratulated as much for their enthusiasm in
service as for their commitment to service.
Sincerely,
Edward V. Daley

What about the banner?

To the Editors:

On Thursday, April 28, the Lee-Jackson La-
crosse Classic banner was removed, by us, from
the Wilson Field scoreboard. The result of which
interfered with an on-going police investigation
involving its original removal from Washington
Street. The individual or group of individuals who
removed the banner is being asked to step for-
ward. By doing so, there will be no charges
brought upon you by the Lexington Police.
However, what is expected from a Washington
and Lee student is a formal written apology to the
citizens and administration of Lexington. The
apology should be written and given to Charles
**Murph”’ Murray, the University Proctor, at his
office located in the Graham-Lees Dormitory.
The letter of apology will then be delivered to the
City Council. This is being done to set to rest the
confusion caused by the removal of the banner
and re-establish the strength of the Honor Code at
Washington and Lee.

Thank you for your cooperation,
John McDonald

English Club is for all majors Abrams isn’t the only one
to leave the Democrats

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

The English Club was started this
year because, according to Jimm
Cobb, ‘‘[Assistant] Professor [of Eng-
lish James P.] Warren saw the need
for the English majors to get together
and share something in common,’

There are four core members of the
group: Jimm Cobb, Jenny Elmes, Be-
tsy Vegso, and Warren, the advisor.
The main focus of the club has
changed since it’s beginning.

‘*Mainly it was begun to discuss lit-

erary criticism. Now the focus is on
reading poetry and other works in

public. It’s sort of like a speech
class,’’ Cobb explained.

The club has already held two poe-
try readings. One was held in the win-
ter and one in the spring. Cobb esti-
mates that about fifteen people atten-
ded the first 1ceding.

Plans for the club include incorpor-
ating the English department awards
ceremony held each spring with the
club’s duties. Club members also
hope to hold a retreat at Skylark next
fall. Skylark is property on mountain
top approximately a half-hour away
from W&L, where senior English
majors hold retreats each fall term.

The club also plans to expand the
number of people allowed to partici-
pate and invite speakers, said Cobb.

Confetti’s is next weekend

 

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

At their regular Monday meeting
Trident announced that Friday, May
20 will mark the beginning of the sec-
ond annual Confetti’s Spring Week-
end. This event offers undergraduate
women an opportunity to invite dates
to a function.

A banquet on Friday evening will
take place at the Ramada Inn. The
banquet includes dinner and a
speaker. The banquet is not an all-
evening event and will allow students
to make plans for later that night.

A Saturday afternoon party at Zoll-
man’s pavilion will begin around |
p.m. It will feature the live entertain-
ment of Derryberry and Aligia, an
acoustic band that has played for
fraternities in the past.

Saturday night’s semi-formal party

will take place in the grass area be-
tween Wood’s Creek and the Univer-
sity library. N’est Pas will play for the
evening’s event.

The area behind the library is
equipped with lighting and electrical
outlets. Afternoon parties with bands
were common about ten years ago, but
the facility has not been used in recent
years. Tents, a dance floor, and tables
will be set up for the event. A tag bar
will offer soft drinks and mixers.

All aspects of the weekend are
sponsored by Trident and will be paid
for from ticket sales. All undergra-
duate women, including exchange
students, can purchase tickets next
week in the Trident office in Univer-
sity Center Monday through Thursday
from 4-6 p.m.

‘This event is intended to provide a
positive opportunity for the undergra-
duate women to sponsor their own
social function,’’ said Liz Smith, one
of the organizers.

Fox named personnel director

 

From Staff Reports

 

Robert W. Fox, Jr., former director
of human resources at Wheaton Col-
lege, has been named director of per-
sonnel services at W&f.."Fox will be-
gin his position on July 1.

A 1968 graduate of the University
of Massachusetts, Fox served for
three years as assistant to the person-
nel director at Connecticut Valley
Hospital. In 1972 he was named the
first personnel director at Hampshire
College in Amherst, Mass. While at

Hampshire, Fox developed and im-
plemented programs for all aspects of
personnel administration.

In 1980 Fox became the first per-
sonnel director for New England
Medical Laboratories in Holliston,
Mass. After serving briefly as person-
nel manager for The Interface Group,
inc. in Needham, Mass., fox was
named director of Human Resources
at Wheaton College in Norton, Mass.

While at Wheaton, Fox participated
in the revision of the wage and salary
administration system, conducted an
analysis of all benefit programs, and
reviewed all personnel policies.

The club is ‘‘open to anyone inter-
ested in literature,’’ says Cobb. He
said four non-English majors attended
the first reading.

Concerning the first meeting, he
said, ‘‘It was really enjoyable. A lot of
people got to read things other people
had never heard before. It really pre-
sented positive feedback to see how
others reacted to your stuff.”’

At the last meeting, two faculty
members showed their support. Sid-
ney Coulling, former head of the Eng-
lish department, and Elizabeth Mor-
gan, currently poet-in-residence, at-
tended.

The club meets twice a term. The
next meeting will be in the fourth
week of fall term.

The inventor of the electronic digi-
tal computer—the computer from
which virtually all modern computer
technology derived—was John Mau-
chly of the University of Pennsyl-
vania. Or so it was thought for 34
years until a court case in 1973 proved
it was not Mauchly, but John V. Atan-
asoff of Iowa State University.

In his most recent book, Atanasoff:
Forgotten Father of the Computer
(Iowa State University Press), Clark
R. Mollenhoff, professor of journal-
ism at W&L, offers the complete story
of the events which proved that Atana-
soff was, in fact, the long unacknow-
ledged inventor of the computer.

Mollenhoff covers the 34 years of
events that led to the 1973 court rul-
ing, as well as the early years of Atan-
asoff’s life and career and the after-
math of his rightful recognition. Using
records of the trial and interviews with
the participants, Mollenhoff examines
the unusual chain of events which led
to the trial and its outcome.

A graduate of Drake University

Law School, Mollenhoff won the Pu-
litzer Prize for national reporting
while working for The Des Moines
Register as a Washington correspon-
dent. It was as Washington bureau
chief, in 1973, that he became in-
volved with the Atanasoff story.

Mollenhoff is the author of 10 other
books. He has been a member of the
faculty since 1976.

MY VIEW
By John Roach

The Assistant Secretary of State, El-
liott Abrams, will be speaking tonight
in Lee Chapel at 7:30. Abrams, a
former Democrat who left his party
when he became disenchanted at the
party’s new interpretation of foreign
affairs, is just one of the many Demo-
crats who have left their party over the
last ten years.

The Democratic Party has always
since 1945 had Henry Wallaces, Ted
Kennedys, and George McGoverns.
But at the same time it had many men
who believed in a strong America and
in for standing up against Communist
aggression. The most important of
these men were Harry Truman, John
F. Kennedy, and Henry ‘‘Scoop’’
Jackson. No one would have ever
heard them blame America first and
always find excuses for our enemies.

There is hardly any wing of the
Democratic Party that believes in an
assertive anti-Soviet stance in the
world. The party is controlled by spe-
cial interest groups and men such as
Jesse Jackson, Jim Wright, and Alan
Cranston. This was not an inviting

prospect for people such as Elliott
Abrams. He believes in helping peo-
ple who want to free themselves from
the chains of Communism and he
could no longer accept the Democrats’
extreme left-wing view of foreign pol-
icy. Abrams was no casual Democrat;
he was administrative assistant to
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and
was a Democrat’s Democrat. But he
felt he had to leave the party, for it
was espousing views contrary to what
he knew was right.

Abrams is not the only example of
this flight from the Donkey’s fold.
Jeanne Kirkpatrick was a_ lifelong
Democrat who could not find a place
in the rapidly changing party. She left
and joined the Republicans and was
probably the best representative our
country has had in the United Nations.
Perhaps the most striking story of
moving to the Republican Party in-
volves Texas Senator Phil Gramm.

Senator Gramm was a Democratic
Congressman in the early 1980s. He
became so frustrated with his party’s
stand against valuable weapons
systems as well as its abandonment of
a vigorous foreign policy that he
changed parties and went home to run
in his district as a Republican. He
won, and a few years later was elected
to the Senate, where he is considered

one of the foremost authorities on for
eign policy in the chamber. There ar:
many more examples of prominent
and just ordinary people, leaving th
Democratic party after they found tha
there was no one in the leadership o
the party who believe in a stron;
national defense and for rolling bacl
the tide of Communism.

Since Elliott Abrams is speaking a
Lee Chapel tonight I think it is impor
tant for everyone to know how harc
this man has been fighting to relieve
the plight of the Nicaraguan freedon
fighters. He has served as the poin
man for the administration on Capito
Hill in trying to convince the Con
gress to support the fight against the
Nicaraguan Marxists. Those who fol
lowed the Iran-Contra hearings las
year may remember his heated testi
mony in defense of the freedom fight
ers as well as his support for Presiden
Reagan during the hearings.

The Democratic party has left main-
stream America. It has abandonec
many defense-minded people as wel
as fervent anti-communists. The peo-
ple of America know that appease-
ment and blind trust of our enemies
are no ways to protect the liberties we
hold so dear. The Democrats offer
nothing- nothing but grounds for deer
anxiety.

Foreign players are tough,
down men’s tennis in finale

 

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

Hampton University was the last
match for the W&L men’s tennis team
during regular season play. The Div-
ision Il power- house visited Lexing-
ton last Saturday.

With an entirely foreign squad, in-
cluding a member of the Pakistani
Davis Cup team, Hampton drubbed
the Generals 8-1. The loss moved
W&L’s regular season team mark to
13-8.

The loss to Hampton was not unex-
pected and did not hurt W&L’s posi-
tion in the seeding for the NCAA
D-III Men’s National Championships,
to be played May 15-22 here in Lex-
ington.

W&L’s 1987 Most Valuable Player,
Bobby Matthews, lost to Hampton's
No. | man Luis Nascimento in
straight sets 3-6, 2-6. In the singles
category, Matthews is ranked 6th in
the nation by the Intercollegiate Ten-
nis Coaches Association.

All-American Matthews’ season re-
cord of 21-11 was good enough to
earn him an invitation to compete as
an individual player as well as part of
W&L’s squad at the national tourna-
ment. The W&L junior was also
named Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference Player-of-the Year earlier this
season.

At the No. 2 spot, W&L junior
Robert Haley, last year’s ODAC
Player-of-the-Year, fell to Flavio

Lima 3-6, 4-6. Haley is ranked 15th

by the ITCA’s April 29 singles poll.

The NCAA Tournament Selec-
tion Committee has selected ten
teams for this year’s Division Il
Men's Tennis Championships.
This is an increase of two teams
over last year’s eight-team field.

WA&L will play host to the tour-
nament, which will begin this Sun-
day, May 15 and last until the fol-
lowing Sunday, May 22. The fol-
lowing team analysis is presented
in the order of seeding as deter-
mined by the Selection Committee.

The Intercollegiate Tennis Coa-
ches Association polls used for this
analysis were issued on April 28th
(teams/doubles) and April 29th
(singles) by the ITCA.

UC-SANTA CRUZ

Santa Cruz, Calif.

ITCA Ranking: No. 1 (79 votes)
Tournament Seed: No. 1

Making their fourth trip to the
national tournament, the Banana
Slugs {that’s right, Banana Slugs!]
finished their season with a blister-
ing 21-1 record. Wins included
Swarthmore (5-4), UC-San Diego
(5-4), Claremont (7-2), Whitman
(8-1), and Emory (8-1). Their
only loss came from Division I
school California State at San Jose
in the Slugs season opener.

The “Slugs owe most of their
success, according to head coach
Bob Hansen, to the team’s ‘‘back-
bone, which has been our bottom
[three] players.’ Leading off this
core is Mark Roberts, ranked No.
37 by the ITCA. An all-American
at the No. 3 singles position,
Roberts has a 19-3 record. Jordan
Einbinder, at No. 5, has not lost
this year, sporting a 22-0 mark.

In doubles action, Hansen is
looking for leadership from his
No. | doubles pair of Matt Nagle
and Einbinder, who have a 10-5
record (ITCA No. 10).

Hansen thinks that the move to
ten teams is a positive step for
D-III tennis. ‘‘It is very healthy
[for the NCAA] to let those bottom
[two] teams in when they are
legitimately strong teams. ”’

ODDS: 3-1. UCSC is used to
winning, period. The ‘Slugs were
ranked fourth going into last year’s
tournament, and faltered against
W&L in the semi-finals. Their
team is strong from top to bottom,
but they haven't played W&L or
Washington College this year,
their two biggest challengers for
the title.

WASHINGTON AND LEE
Lexington, Va.

Season Record: 13-8
ITCA Ranking: No. 3 (64)
Tournament Seed: No. 2

For the last two years, W&L has
finished second in the nation, los
ing both times to Kalamazoo in the

 

   

individually and as a W&L team
member at the upcoming national
tournament.

Senior co-captain David McLeod,
now 23-8, also fell to his Hampton foe
No. 3 singles. Islam Ul-Naq_beat
McLeod 6-4, 6-3. A two-time all-
American, McLeod is currently ran-
ked 51st by the ITCA.

McLeod will compete individually
next week, as well as with the team.
He and Matthews, his consistent dou-
bles partner, will compete in the dou-
bles title race as well. The pair is ran-
ked No. 3 by the ITCA with a 26-5 re-
cord.

Sophomore John Morris scored
W&L’s only point at No. 4, where he
defeated Hampton’s Wuri Ajibade 7-6
(4), 3-6, 6-4.

Last year’s Freshman Player-of-the-
Year, Morris will take the team’s best
singles record, at 28-3, into the
national championship. Morris will be
competing in all three national
contests; singles, doubles and the
team championship.

An all-American in 1985, W&L’s
Chris Wiman played Yakubu Sulei-
man at No. 5. Wiman dropped to
Suleiman in straight sets 2- 6, 1-6.

Although the senior co-captain is
not playing as an individual qualifier
next week, he and partner Morris
(22-8 as a doubles team) will compete
in the doubles tournament. Both the
doubles and singles titles will be de-
cided after the team competition has
concluded on Wednesday. The pair is
ranked 24th by the ITCA.

The only freshman in W&L’s var-
sity line-up, Bill Meadows also fell in
straight sets to his Hampton aggres-
sor. Pedro Alipio took the No. 6

match 6-4, 6-2. The loss to Alipio
dropped Meadows’ record to an even
15-15. Meadows will be competing as
a member of the W&L team next
week,

At No. 1, Matthews and McLeod
also fell in doubles. The pair, favored
to do well at Nationals next week, lost
to Nascimento and Lima 4-6, 4-6.

WA&L’s second pair of Morris and
Wiman pushed Hampton’s Ul- Naq
and Ajibade to a third set before falter-
ing. The Hampton duo won 6-3, 1-6,
6-4.

Haley and Meadows also lost at the
No. 3 doubles spot. Hampton’s pair of
Alipio and Suleiman took the W&L
pair in straight sets 6-1, 6-3.

As a result of a telephone confer-
ence call held Sunday among the
members of the Selection Committee,
W&L was seeded second in the
national tournament, behind the Uni-
versity of California at Santa Cruz.
The Generals have finished second in
the nation for the past two years, los-
ing to Kalamazoo 6-3 both times.

Head coach Gary Franke, a member
of the selection committee, said he
‘*was very pleased that we have been
selected again to play in this tourna-
ment.’’ As to the Generals’ chances at
winning their first national title,
Franke thought that the team has
‘‘worked hard to reach this point and
now we have to work even harder to
succeed.”

From this Sunday, May 15th, to
Wednesday, May 18, ten teams will
compete for the team title. Play will
use all of the W&L courts, as well as
nearby Virginia Military Insitutes’
tennis facility, located in the valley
behind the school’s barracks.

finals. Now, for the second time in
four years, the Generals have the
home court advantage in this battle
for the national title. Senior co-
captains David McLeod and Chris
Wiman most certainly do not want
this opportunity to slip through
their fingers again.

Three of the Generals’ losses
were at the hands of D-I programs
at Davidson, Penn State, and Wil-
liam & Mary.

Another loss, perhaps more im-
portant than all the others, was to
Washington College, 5-4, at
Swarthmore. This loss, combined
with various results from other
competition between the three
teams, had them in an almost vir-
tual deadlock going into the tour-
nament selection process.

The Generals are led by junior
Bobby Matthews, who moved up
to the No. | position in March. His
personal mark stands at 21- 11, and
Matthews is ranked No. 6 by the
ITCA. Robert Haley, another jun-
ior, closed out the regular season
with a 16-16 mark. Haley is well-
respected by the ITCA, at No. 15
nationally.

The Generals are also strong in
doubles, where Matthews and
McLeod (26-5) sport a No. 3 ITCA
ranking.

ODDS: 3-1. W&L is in great
position to spoil the ’Slugs season
of hard work. W&L players com-
bine for fifteen hungry years of
national championship play. The
Generals have charged hard for the
past two years, finishing second
both times, and they will be in the
thick of it again this year.

SWARTHMORE COLLEGE
Swarthmore, Pa.

Season Record: 13-8

ITCA Ranking: No. 2
Tournament Seed: 3

The Little Quakers finished their
regular season with a 13-8 record,
playing a packed schedule, includ-
ing seven contests against D-I pro-
grams.

Swarthmore lost five of their
seven D-I contests, and dropped a
decision to only one D-II team.
Head coach Michael Mullan cited
two good wins against strong D-I
teams, downing Penn State 7-2 and
the University of Pennsylvania
6-3.

In D-H action, Mullan pointed
to satisfying wins over Washington
College (6-3) and Claremont (5-4),
two teams attending this year’s
tournament.

Swarthmore sustained several
losses in their D-III schedule,
which explains their seed position.
The Litthe Quakers dropped mat-
ches to UC-Santa Cruz (5-4) and
W&L (7-2), teams ranked first and
second in the nation, respectively.

Mullan will be looking to his
best players to push his team
through the tournament. Andy
Mouer, the Little Quakers’ top
shaker, is ranked No. 2 in the

nation by the ITCA. This Austin,
Texas native is expected to do well
in both the team and individual por-
tions of the championships.

In the doubles arena, the
"Quakers are led into battle by
Mouer and his partner Andy
Dailey. This combo is ranked No.
7 in the nation by the ITCA, and
stand a good chance of advancing
in the doubles competition.

ODDS: 6-1. Swarthmore may
have beaten Washington College
and Claremont, but they fell to two
of the most qualified teams for the
crown, W&L and UCSC. They
will face one of these teams before
the team finals. If the Little
Quakers can beat either team, then
look out!

WASHINGTON COLLEGE
Chestertown, Md.

Season Record: 22-3

ITCA Ranking: No. 4 (56)
Tournament Seed: No. 4

Head coach Fred Wyman has done
wonders in four years. His Shore-
men have leaped from an unranked
no-name program to one of the
deepest D-III teams in the nation.
His squads have made three conse-
cutive trips to the tournament, fin-
ishing eighth two years ago and
third last year.

Playing a tough D-III schedule,
with only five home matches, the
Shoremen had key wins early
against highly-ranked Principia
and Ripon, who fell to Washington
in the same week, both by scores of
8-1.

The Shoremen also beat W&L
5-4 in what Wyman called ‘‘a huge
win.’’ He emphasized the irony of
the top two teams in the nation
coming down to the last match,
facing W&L’s top-ranked pair
against his No. 2 duo. *‘I was so
nervous I had to leave after the
second set,”’ he said.

The Shoremen are lead by
underclassmen heavyweights.
Larry Gewer (ITCA No. 3), a 16-4
sophomore, was an all-American
last year in singles and doubles.
Wyman described Gewer’s playing
style as oddly defensive. ‘‘He
doesn’t attack. He is an effective
counter puncher.”’

At No. 2 is Scott Flippin-Read, a
Texas freshman (ITCA No. 25).
At 19-3, Flippin-Read’s only D-III
loss was handed down by fellow
Texan Bobby Matthews, W&L’s
No. | netter.

These two combine to form
Washington’s No.1 doubles pair.
The two were ranked No. 2 by the
ITCA, and are Il-4.

ODDS: 3-1. The Shoremen are
tough. They have depth that even
out-distances UCSC and W&L,
which is vital as they push up the
polls. They are the team that will
challenge both those schools. Even
if they don’t finish first this year,
they will be back.

TOURNAMENT ANALYSI
Nationals expand to 10 teams; ’Slugs ranked No. 1

KALAMAZOO
Kalamazoo, Mich.
Season Record: 14-8
ITCA Ranking: No. 5 (51)
Tournament Seed: No. 5

Already repeat tournament cham-
pions, the 14-7 Hornets have their
work cut out for them if they Wish
to capture a third consecutive title.
Graduation took four of last year’s
seven, including powers Alex Pal-
ladino and Jim Burda, as well as
Kalamazoo’s top two doubles
combos. Head coach George
Acker said that this year, ‘‘instead
of being chased, we are doing the
chasing.”’

During regular season action,
Kalamazoo defeated two D-I
teams, Western Michigan Univer-
sity and Notre Dame, both by 5-4
scores. Seven of their eight losses
came from D-I teams.

Their most notable D-III wins
came against Emory, who the
Hornets beat 8-1, and the Univer-
sity of the South, who fell 5-2 in a
time-shortened match.

Kalamazoo’s experienced sting-
ers are led by senior buzzer Jack
Hosner, 14-8 (ITCA No. 4), who
has risen to the top from No. 5 as a
freshman.

Acker was happy to see the field
expanded to ten teams. ‘“‘It’s just
tremendous,’’ he said. ‘The
Committee didn’t feel like they had
left someone out.”’

ODDS: 6-1. Don’t count the
Hornets out of anything, including
the team title. They are the vet-
erans of the tournament, with al-
most twenty years of combined.
tournament experience.

UC-SAN DIEGO

San Diego, Calif.

Season Record: 21-10
ITCA Ranking: No. 6 (40)
Tournament Seed: No. 6

Not appearing last year, the Tri-
tons will arrive in Lexington with
their hopes high. San Diego fin-
ished their season with only one
loss in D-II action, with a 10-1 re-
cord. UCSD played a tough sched-
ule, including many D-I and NAIA
programs.

Their sole D-III loss came at the
hands of UC-Santa Cruz, who
scraped past them in a tight 5-4
match. The Tritons turned around
to defeat No. 7 Claremont 5-4, and
No. 9 Whitman by the same nar-
row margin. Whitman earned only
one match point in singles action,
however.

With a record of 18-11, Hunter
Gallaway, (ITCA No. 14) UCSD’s
No. | singles player, has beaten
Santa Cruz’ No. 1 man, Ron
Ward, Claremont’s top man,

good idea, and that they the selec-
tion committee should go to twelve
teams.’’ Hammermeister added,
‘*Division III tennis, over the last
few years, has become a lot
deeper.”’

ODDS: 8-1. UCSD does not
have the balanced attack that some
of the stronger teams feature.
However, led by Gallaway, the
Tritons have an outside chance at
the team crown. However, they
haven't played many of the teams
at the tournament.

CLAREMONT
Claremont, Calif.

Season Record: 24-11
ITCA Ranking: No. 7 (32)
Tournament Seed: No. 7

With only four D-I teams on their
calendar, the Claremont Stags
played a respectable D-III schedule
this year, and they did a respecta-
ble job. The Stags crowned their
regular season by going undefeated
in the Southern California Intercol-
legiate Athletic Conference, with a
12-0 mark.

D-III losses included UC-Santa
Cruz 7-2, Swarthmore 4-5, UC-
San Diego 4-5, and Rochester,
who was well-ranked in pre-season
polls, 4-5.

Claremont notched regular
season wins against several other
D-III teams, including Whitman
5-4, Emory 6-3, Gustavus Adol-
phus 6-3, St. Thomas 5-4, and
Washington University 7-2.

The singles squad is led by Frank
Hinman (ITCA No. 7), who was
21-9 during regular season action.
Supporting Hinman at No. 2 is
Pete Gertmenian (ITCA No. 29),
finishing out at 20-13, and the
Stags’ No. 3 man, Lance Au
(ITCA No. 60), 26-9.

This year, Claremont’s fifth trip
to a national championship tour-
nament, the Stags are led by their
strong doubles combinations.

ODDS: 8-1. Head coach Hank
Krieger feels that his team is
strongest at doubles, but don’t for-
get the singles. Claremont has
tournament experience, and has
played east coast teams this year.
The Stags could be one of this
year’s spoilers.

UNIVERSITY OF THE SOUTH
Sewanee, Tenn.

Season Record: 24-5

ITCA Ranking: No. 8 (21)
Tournament Seed: No. 8

The University of the South is
making its first ever team appear-
ance in the tournament, and head
coach John Shackelford feels that
his 24-5 Tigers will do well.

Sewanee played eleven teams
that were ranked in the ITCA D-
III pre-season poll, with two of the
11 actually getting tournament
bids. They logged three D-I losses
to state schools, dropping matches
to Middle Tenn. State, Tenn.
Tech, and UT- Chattanooga.

From Staff Reports

<

For the third time in his tenure at,
W&L, head coach Buck Leslie’s golf
team will be competing in the NCAA*

Division II] Championships.

The tournament will be hosted by ,

Greensboro College in North Caro-

lina. It will be held May 17-20 at the ‘
Farm Course (Greensboro Country ,

Club).

The team members representing*
W&L will be seniors Gary Campbell, +
John Gammage, and James Sowersby, |
and juniors Pete Coleman and Tom

Wingfield.

‘

:

“It’s a lot more fun with a team,””’

said Leslie, who had teams participat-,
ing in the NCAA Championships in

1977 (7th-place) and

(1 1th-place).

:

“It’s definitely an honor to rep-,
resent our area,’’ said Leslie. ‘‘We
weren’t favored to win our confer-'
ence...that’s what makes this oppor-,

tunity a lot sweeter.”

According to Leslie, ‘‘Our mail
goal is to be competitive...four days ’

of golf is a good test.”’

‘‘T don’t know the strength of a lot .
of these teams,’’ said Leslie. ‘‘We’ll
have the same tee order and I hope we '
can pick up where we left off in the +

ODAC tournament.’’

r

There will be 21 teams and 15 indi- ,
viduals participating from across the

country. The total number of partici- *

pants will be 120.

The Tigers were fierce in D-III
action, losing only two matches.
Wins came against Washington
University, Carlton, Principia, and
two notches against Emory.

Sewanee’s No. 1 man, Pat
Guerry, has been ranked fifth in
ITCA singles polls. Kéy wins in-
clude a straight-set blasting of
Principia’s Toby Clark (ITCA No.
1), and two wins over Emory’s Ji-
mmy Strauss.

Shackelford places his doubles
trust in the strong hands of Tim
Lufkin and Ken Alexander, ranked
llth by the ITCA. The dynamic
duo’s biggest win came against
Emory’s Mike Beck / Chris Walser
pair (ITCA No. 18) in the third set
of the South Region No. 1 flight
Championships.

ODDS: 10-1. Sewanee has a lot
of heart, as well as some good ten-
nis players. However, tournament
experience, or lack thereof, may
prove to be their Achilles’ heel in
this year’s title race.

WHITMAN

Walla Walla, Wash.
Season Record: 14-5
ITCA Ranking: No. 9 (16)
Tournament Seed: No. 9

The Whitman Missionaries may
have not played as many matches
as some other programs, but their
schedule, and results, show hidden
strength in this low-seeded team.

Whitman was 4-1 against area
D-I competition, including win-
ning the University of Idaho’s oth-
erwise all D-I tournament. Their
one loss was to the University of
Washington.

In D-III competition, the Mis-
sionaries lost 1-8 to UCSC, and
beat Emory 5-4. Whitman dropped
two very close matches against
tournament participants UCSD and
Claremont, losing each 4-5.
Whitman lost match point at No. 6
against UCSD, and faltered in the
doubles against Emory after jump-
ing to a 4-2 lead after the singles

Head coach Art Furman will
look to his No. | player Eugene
Kim, (ITCA No. 16) who was
17-11, and Phil Ansdell, 23-9 at
No. 2, for team leadership. The
Missionaries, who placed fourth at
the 1986 Championships, have an
added advantage of several experi-
enced international players, as well
as a native son, returning from that
team.

Roberto Carcamo, a Nicaraguan
who finished this year 17-12 at the
No. 3 spot, Canadian Dave Olafs-
son, 23-3 at No. 4 and Jeff.Nor-
tham, 17-11 at No. 6, will offer
experience and direction to their
fellow Missionaries.

ODDS: 12-1. The Missionaries
have a decent prayer of outplaying
their 9th seed, but they will need a
miracle to win the whole show.

The Ring-tum Phi, May 12, 1988

Some Pop debuts with a Bang

 

By Marshall Boswell
Staff Reporter

All at once, after a profoundly bleak
and dull year, there are some remar
kably good pop records out there. Re
cords with brains and hearts, not just
groins and pocketbooks. Records
worth the price of a compact disc,
rather than ones only worth taping on
a free sign-it-home-to-mom-and-pop
blank cassette from the bookstore bar
rel. Records that you might actually
play again next fall, instead of tape
over when something new comes
along

And although the chances are slim
that you will actually be able to find
any of these platters in Lexington
these records are nonetheless worth
leaving home for

First up is an album I've personally
been waiting two impatient vears for.
Prefab Sprout’s 7wo Wheels Good is
the only absolutely perfect pop record
I own; there is not one misplaced note
on the whole disk. And I’ve been
wondering if they could do it again.

And they have. Their new one is
called From Langley Park to Memphis
and its only flaw is that it has one less
track than Two Wheels Good. What
does Prefab Sprout sound like? Imag-
ine if George Gershwin wrote songs
with Steely Dan; imagine the Smiths
with Weather Report as a back-up
band; imagine the Partridge Family
crossed with the Beatles.

I could quote lyric after lyric from
this album, but [ll narrow my en-
thusiasm down to few great lines from
‘Cars and Girls,’ a song that won-
ders wonderfully about Bruce Spring-
steen’s concept of life (““Some things
hurt more much more than cars and
girls’): ‘*Little boy got a hot rod; /
Thinks it makes him some kind of new
God.”*’ Multiply that by an infinite and
buy this record.

Frisco’s Bobs to sing at Lime Kiln Arts

 

From Staff Reports

just espousing knee-jerk

 

They’re hip. They're hilarious. And
they're performing in concert just
west of Lexington on May 14.

The Bobs, San Francisco’s Grammy
award-nominated new wave a cappella
group, will be in concert at Lime Kiln
Arts’ Theater for one performance
only: Saturday, May 14, beginning at
8 p.m. t

With their hilariously poignant lyr-
ics and vocal wizardry, The Bobs
have performed on National Public
Radio, MTV and at festivals and con-
cert halls across America and Europe,
and have won an incredible loyal fol-
lowing.

‘The fans are loyal because The
Bobs are, quite simply, one of the best
and most original groups in pop mu-
sic,’ saidThe Oakland (Cal.) Tribune.

The Bobs’ music defines categoriza-
tion. The Los Angeles Times said they
*‘land squarely in the twilight zone be-
tween a barbershop quartet and
Devo.”

Boulder Colorado’s Daily Camera
said they sound like *‘Pee Wee Her-
man on helium, the Beach Boys har-
monizing with the Mormon Taberna-
cle Choir or the Andrews Sister sing-
ing opera with Motley Crue,’’ and
then allowed they really don’t sound
like any of them.

They've also been compared to
1960s satirist Tom Lehrer, the Mills
Brothers, Sly and the Family Stone,
the Manhattan Transfer, Lambert,
Ross and Hendricks, Spike Jones,
Frank Zappa, and Gregorian chanters.

Just why The Bobs are so difficult to
categorize was summed up best by
music critic Jared Rutter. They are, he
said, ‘‘perhaps the strangest vocal
group of all time. The audacity of the
conception, and the way they bring it
off, is dazzling.”

The Church is another group that
has kept me waiting two years for a
new album, and their last one, Heyday
is one of about ten almost perfect pop
records I own. Their latest, Starfish,
isn’t perfect, isn’t quite almost per-
fect, but is definitely almost-almost
perfect, which is close enough.
Whereas on Heyday the Church
brought in a string section, sitars,
horns and a children’s choir to boost
their music into the heavens, Starfish
relies entirely on the angelic commi
ngling of two finely-tuned Ricken
backer guitars soaked in heavy doses
of flanger and chorus to send Steve
Kilbey’s crisp yet ethereal tunes sky
ward.

The theme here is travel of the cos
mic sort, as evidenced on their lush
new single, ‘‘Under the Milky Way,”’
and singer Kilbey announces his aims
on the record’s first line: ‘Our in-
struments have no way to penetrate
this ceiling." From there, Starfish
soars along beautifully and powerfu
lly, the whole thing produced so pris
tinely that the listener can even hear
through the crystalline digital mix
guitarist Marty Wilson-Piper fiddle
with the volume switch on his guitar.

Admittedly, one problem is that all
ten tracks have the identical guitar
sound as their driving force, but when
there isn’t individually a dud in the
whole basket, I can only make that as
a marginal criticism. Key tracks are
‘Milky Way,” “‘Lost,’’ and *‘Hotel
Womb.*’ Yeah, verily I say unto thee,
go thee to Church. Amen.

Now it is time to wax political.
There has not been a decent mix of po-
litics and anthematic rock-n-roll since
the Clash let London Calling out of its
cage, and that includes U2. I’m talk-
ing here about addressing specific is-
sues with intellectual responses, not
humani-
tarianism and wrapping it up as a sell-

ing point. Thank God Midnight Oil's
Diesel and Dust and Ruben Blades’
Nothing But the Truth change all that.
In tact, it is hard to believe that these
two records have emerged in the same

i
year

Midnight Oil first. This record de
buted in the Oil’s homeland, Austra
lia, at Number One. Here, the last
time that happened was with Whitney
Houston. That says something, I
think. And this is not just a harmless
pop record. This is unbelievably
powerful rock-n-roll, like the sort the
Clash and the Jam used to make, that
attacks in no uncertain terms govern
mental brutality toward that nation’s
Aborigines. This theme is most em-
phatically traced out in ‘*Warakurna’’
and ‘*The Dead Heart,”’ two of the
album’s best tracks, but this is not all
that Diesel and Dust is about. There
are songs about more general topics,
like arms control (**Put Down That
Weapon’’) and ecology (*‘Bull
Roarer’’), Singer Peter Garret’s
angry, nasal shout is punctuated em-
phatically by a mix that is so punish-
ing in its percussive thump that the
music threatens to burst right through
your speakers.

Although the specificity with which
Midnight Oil addresses these topics is
admirable, the Aborigine problem in
particular takes on a poignantly uni-
versal tone in these ten blistering
tracks, making us question our own
government's treatment of Indians and
the citizens of Central America. And
you can dance to it too.

Speaking of Central America,
Ruben Blades’ message is
timely now than it ever has been.
Blades is a Panamanian-born §sal-
sa/jazz/pop/whatever superstar
whose Spanish-language recordings
have been both popular (because
Blades is a great songwriter) and con-
troversial (for their outspoken politi-

The Bobs will play Saturday night for Lime Kiln Arts.

‘*There is no precedent for The
Bobs,”’ said critic Larry Kelp.
**Working with no instruments other
than their voices, and no safety net,
The Bobs have almost over night be-
come the hot attraction on the Bay
Area music scene.”’ Their music, he
said, ‘‘proves that four voices can do
far more than has been tried or even
imagined. ”’

With original songs about laundry,
politics, shoes, weather and weath-
ermen, the Beach Boys, cats, apes,
and martial spats over trash, and with
their stunning covers of oldies ranging
from Sam the Sham to Led Zeppelin
tunes, “‘The Bobs are nothing less

than sensational,”’ said the Los Ang-

eles Daily News.
They ‘‘prove that the human voice

remains the most powerful instrument
of all,’’ according to The Washington
Post.

‘I don’t know if they’re Nu-Wave
or even New Wave, but I do know that
their first alhum is the most fun you

more ,

cal bent).

Now Blades--who, by the way, has

a degree in law from Harvard --has
recorded an English album with a few
friends of his, most notably Lou Reed,
Elvis Costello and Sting. The
album, Nothing But the Truth, is a
brilliant mix of tasteful, mature pop
(‘I Can’t Say’*), no-holds-barred sal-
sa ( ‘Chameleons,’ ‘‘The Miranda
Syndrome”), reggae (‘In Salva-
dor’), and anthematic rock (‘‘The
Calm Before the Storm’’). Sting
writes one, Elvis Costello helps on
two, and Lou Reed co- writes three.
But the amazing thing is that Blades’
individual tracks are every bit as fo-
cused and accomplished as the colla-
borations.

Blades’ perspective on today’s is-
sues is fuelled by passion, humor and
a keen intellect. In “‘The Letter,’’ a
young man who writes to a friend who
is dying of AIDS offers these lines as

Tennis nets W&L’s first national title

 

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

After finishing second for two years
in a row, the Washington and Lee
men’s tennis team won this year’s
Division II] national championship,
becoming the first W&L team to ever
win a national title. The General's in-
credible come-from-behind win put
the cap on the first half of an interest-
ing week of tennis.

W&L won the title yesterday with a
5-4 victory over the University of Ca-
lifornia-Santa Cruz Banana Slugs.
UCSC was the No. | seed at the tour-
nament and had a regular season re-
cord of 21-1, without a single D-II
loss.

Yesterday's and Tuesday’s rain for-
ced play to be moved to the indoor fa-
cilities in Staunton and Lynchburg.
The shift of venue took away some of
the General’s homecourt advantage,
but support was definitely present dur-
ing the match.

The two teams faced off yesterday
afternoon and evening at the Staunton
Racquet Club. With only three courts
and room for only several dozen fans,
the Club has seen heavy use during the
tournament.

Supported by as many W&L stu-
dents that could squeeze in the gallery,

the Generals rallied from a 4-2 deficit,
sweeping the three doubles matches to
edge the Slugs 5-4.

W&L was led by its cagey veterans,
senior co-captains Chris Wiman and
David McLeod, throughout the long
match. Play began at 1:30 in the after
noon, and, with a two-hour break be-
tween singles and doubles, didn’t end
until 11:20 last night.

Junior Bobby Matthews, W&L’s
No. | man, lost quickly in straight sets
to UCSC’s Ron Ward 6-2, 6-3. Matt-
hews will continue action in the sec-
ond half of this tournament week,
competing in both singles and doubles
action. Matthews is seeded sixth in the
singles competition.

Junior Robert Haley, at No. 2 for
the Generals, battled back brilliantly
against Chad Andrews, but faltered
late in the third set. Andrews was pin-
ned to the baseline in the first set, los-
ing to Haley 6-2. Andrews rallied,
however, sending the match into over-
time with a 6-3 win in the second set.
Haley made a run at Andrews, tying
the third set at 4-4 games, but slipped,
losing 6-4.

Haley will also compete this week
in singles action.

McLeod had early difficulty against

UCSC’s No. 3 man, Mark Roberts

Elliott Abrams speaks in Lee Chapel.

Abrams gives views
on Central America

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The Reagan years have brought
great progress in U.S. efforts to main-
tain and expand democracy in Central
America, according to Elliott
Abrams, the U.S. assistant secretary
of state for inter-American affairs.

A key figure in last summer’s Iran-
Contra hearings, Abrams spoke in Lee
Chapel Thursday night on U.S. for-
eign policy, the growth of democracy
and the narcotics trade in Latin Amer-
ica and the Caribbean.

Only 30 percent of Latin America
was democratic in 1980, according to
Abrams, but he said the percentage
today is closer to 90.

This is ‘*not perfect democracy, but
we are moving clearly’’ in that direc-
tion, he said, because of an across-the-
board policy that involves both pres-
sure and negotiations,

Abrams stressed the need for con-
sistency in dealing with oppressive
governments in Latin America and
called the February cutoff of aid to the
Contras by Congress ‘‘an exceedingly
dumb move.”” He said the removal of
U.S. pressure allowed the Sandinistas
to violate agreements with the Contras
concerning freedom of the press and
opposition parties and to resume
efforts to break unions

Abrams said one of the obstacles to
permanent democracy in the region is
the drug trade, which he called ‘‘an
incredibly profitable industry’* and ‘‘a
threat to political stability and democ
racy.”

‘We're up against something evil,”
he said. **There is no crime they {drug
traffickers] will not commit.”

Abrams said that, to stop the drug
trade, supply and demand must both
be reduced and interdiction efforts
must be increased.

Wealthy drug traffickers and com-
munist-backed guerrillas work closely

together, he said. In Columbia, drug
money supports anti-American
protests, and left-wing guerrillas
protect cocaine laboratories, said
Abrams.

The Reagan administration’s point
man on the Contra aid issue since July
of 1985, Abrams has made frequent
appearances before congressional
committees looking into U.S. support
of the Nicaraguan Resistance.

Testifying in June before the con-
gressional committees investigating
the Iran-Contra affair, Abrams admit-
ted to having misled Congress in ear-
lier testimony about his involvement
in Contra fund-raising activities,
cording to the Washington Post.

Abrams told Congress he made *
great mistake’’ six months on
when he did not tell the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence about
efforts to solicit $10 million for the
Contras from the nation of Brunei

Responding to a question Thursday
night, Abrams said that, when he ap-
peared before the Senate committee,

ac-

he realized Congress “‘clearly
would have wanted to know about”
the solicitation of money from Brunei.

But Abrams said he did not to men
tion that effort because officials from
Brunei had insisted that the deal be
kept secret and because he did not
have the permission of Secretary of
State George Schultz to discuss the
matter.

Abrams joined the executive branch

in 1981 as the assistant secretary of

state responsible for supervising U.S.
involvement in the United Nations.
He was named assistant secretary for
Human Rights and Humanitarian At
fairs less than a year later and re
mained in that position until assuming
his current post

Abrams’ the

project of the W&L Executive Com-
mittee and Interfraternity Council

address was sixth

a joint

set, but shook free of Roberts to win
7-5. McLeod left no questions in the
second set though, slamming Roberts
6-1

McLeod, although not highly ran-
ked in either category, will compete in
both singles and doubles competition,
starting today. Sophomore John Mor-
ris, who will also see second-half ac-
tion in both singles and doubles, lost
to UCSC’s No. 4 netter, Matt Nagle.
The first set was quite close, with
Morris and Nagle trading leads
throughout. Nagle won the tie-breaker
7-2 to take the first set 7-6.

Morris struggled in the second, and
could not rally. Nagle upped the
"Slugs score to 3-1 by closing out his
match against Morris 6-2.

Intent on a national title, Chris Wi-
man took on Jordan Einbinder at No.
5 singles. Einbinder was undefeated
this entire season with a 24-0 record
including the tournament, but Wiman
was not intimidated.

Wiman, who will play doubles with
Morris, grabbed the first set 6-4. Ein-
binder rallied in the second to keep the
match alive, jumping out 6-2. Wiman
returned in the third to keep the Gen-
eral’s national championship hopes
alive, winning 6-3.

Earl Cole fit right in with the fresh-
men class. In the register, he’s posed
in a coat and a tie, smiling from his
high school graduation picture. Like
the rest of the freshmen, he listed his
home town, high school, potential
major, and extracurricular interests.

Unlike the rest of the freshmen,

"CO hasn't been rushed” studied’ for

final exams or watched the sun set
from the parkway.

“Instead of starting school, he has
been working 24-hours-a-day surviv-
ing,’ said Anne Bunai, his mother, in
a recent interview.

Intoxicated, driving over the speed
limit, Cole crashed into a tractor
trailer one night last July. He was on
his way home from a W&L, pre-rush,
Delta Tau Delta fraternity party.

Cole’s right leg and his pelvis were
severely injured. He also suffered a
severe blow to his head, resulting in
extensive neural injuries.

He spent the next two and a half
months in intensive care at the Bryn

Deaver

to speak
tonight

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

 

For the second time in a week, a key
Reagan administration official will
speak at W&L as part of the Contact
lecture series.

Michael Deaver, the former deputy
White House chief of staff who Time
magazine said knows Ronald Reagan
better than any man alive, will speak
tonight at 7:30 in Lee Chapel on the
successes and failures of the Reagan
presidency.

Deaver’s address comes just one
week after Contact presented a speech
by Iran-Contra figure Elliott Abrams,
the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs.

Deaver served on the president's
staff from 1981 until May of 1985,
when he left the White House and
opened his own public relations and
lobbying firm, Michael K. Deaver and
Associates.

But, despite his status as a profes-
sional lobbyist, Deaver has main-
tained his close ties with the president,
and suspicions that Deaver may have
used his fr iendship with Reagan illega-
lly led to an investigation by Indepen-
dent Counsel Whitney North Sey-
mour.

Although he was never charged
with illegal lobbying, Deaver was ac-
cused of perjury and was eventually
convicted on charges of lying to a
House subcommittee and a federal
grand jury investigating his lobbying

Action from this week’s NCAA Division III National Championship Tournament.

Prospective freshman struggles
to regain memory after accident

lowed by a seven month stint as an in-
patient there.

Cole had to re-learn every bodily
function. In October, three and a half
months after the accident, he finally
learned to swallow. The neurons in
Cole’s brain were beginning a long
process of repair and regeneration.

Cole was unable to recognize peo-
ple and remember events for six
months. *‘He couldn’t remember what
whe, had for breakfast,’’ Bunai_ said,

“You had a feeling that he wasn’t
there.”’ The doctors at Bryn Mawr
were not optimistic about Cole’s re-
covery.

But on January 10, Cole re-
membered having visitors. He became
aware of his surroundings and his
conditions. Cole was determined to
recover.

Physical, occupational, cognitive
and speech therapy is helping Cole put
his life back together. Now, he walks
with a walker. He speaks slowly but
understandably.

“*He’s absolutely a miracle,”’
Bunai.

said

*“*My next goal is to walk with a
cane,’’ Cole said in a recent inter-
view. ‘‘Then I'll be by myself, alone.

I can’t wait until that.”’

Bunai openly refers to her son’s ac-
cident as a tragedy. Cole was an ex-
ceptional student, she said. In addi-
tion, he was recruited to play lacrosse
for the Generals.

The accident also took a toll on his
family. They had to drive for three
and a half hours to visit Cole at the
hospital. In April, Cole went home.
But he still must be driven to the hos-
pital for 16 hours of therapy every
week.

Economic challenges are also threa-
tening. According to Bunai, the bill
will total $4 million before Cole is
completely recovered. Cole luckily
has exceptional life insurance cover-
age, said Bunai.

Bunai hopes that some good comes
of Cole’s tragedy. First, she hopes
young people will stop ignoring the
consequences of driving under the in-
fluence.

Bunai said that most of the patients
at Bryn Mawr Rehabilitation Hospital
are 15 to 25 years old, just about the
age of most college students. Furth-
ermore, most were victims of car or
motorcycle accidents.

Bunai said that young adults fail to
properly gage risks when they decide

to drive after drinking.

“Teenagers are fatalistic,’’ she
said, ‘‘They say, ‘if it’s my time to
come, it’s my time to come.**’

“Kids think about people dying and
people surviving, but they never think
about what people who survive are
like. There are so many kids who will
never think, love, relate, walk
again,’ she said.

Bunai also hopes that young people
will stop friends from driving drunk.
She realizes that her son was respon-
sible for himself; but, she is disturbed
because a fraternity president and an-
other student walked Cole to his car
before he left for home. They must
have noticed that he was heavily intox-
icated, she said.

“Take the courage to sa,’ something
to someone,” she said. ** Not saying it
is a great risk. One doesn’t realize that
he has saved an accident from happen-
ing.

“They say that once you had a
closed head injury, you’re never the
same again,’’ she continued. Still,
Bunai looks forward to the day her son
may be able to attend his first college
class, in January, 1989.

“Earl is doing very well,’’ she said,
“but he’s got a long way to go.”’

Art Farm is more than a gallery

By Alice Harrell
Staff Reporter

 

Just off of Route 39, only a couple
of miles out of Lexington, one will
find what appears on the outside to be
a quaint, pleasant-looking country
house situated at the top of a hill with
a farmhouse and garden off to the
side.

Such houses are common in Lexing
ton, but within this farmhouse is
something unique, the likes of which
are not apt to be found in any other
farmhouse for miles around

This farmhouse contains over 100
works by I-Hsiung Ju, Artist-in
Residence at W&L. Ju

came here

from the University of Connecticut in
1969 and has been teaching art here
ever since.

In 1975 he, his family and seven of
his art students took up residence in
the house on the hill, and set to work
remodeling the adjacent farmhouse.

“We worked, redoing the founda
tion, repaired the walls and roof, put
glass in the windows...but no heat

placed in each room to keep out the
cold

Tomorrow afternoon, a dedication ceremony will be held in the
gatehouse of Gaines Residence Hall. Members of the Board of
Trustees, President Wilson, and others will be present as the son of
Francis Pendleton Gaines unveils a memorial plaque honoring the
man who was president of the university for years and whose name
was chosen to grace the newest living accomodations on campus.

 

It seems amazing to some residents of the building that this day is
finally arriving. We have been living in Gaines Hall since Septem-
ber, waiting for all of the construction to be finished and the build-
ing to work out some of the kinks which seem to be unavoidable in
new construction.

Residents arrived at the beginning of the school year expecting to
find a completed, or nearly completed, residence facility. Instead,
we found poor paint jobs, disabled furniture, a non-functioning ele-
vator, no sidewalks, a quad area which looked as though it could be
the location for the next Mid-Atlantic Championship Mud Wres-
tling tournament, a laundry room which wasn’t ready for use, no
weight room as promised, malfunctioning fire alarms (individual
units and the building system as a whole), less than adequate park-
ing space and a gatehouse lounge area which was nowhere near fin-
ished.

We kept hearing predictions. ‘Gaines will be completed in mid-
September.’’ ‘‘Gaines should be finished in time for homecoming
weekend.’ ‘‘They’re planning to completely finish Gaines before
Parents’ Weekend.’’ ‘‘Maybe Gaines will be finished when we get
back from Thanksgiving break.’’ ‘“‘Maybe Gaines will be finished
when we get back from Christmas break.”’ ‘‘Maybe Gaines will be
finished when we get back from February Break...”’

Maybe Gaines wasn’t finished until Alumni Weekend when they
finished installing banisters on every outdoor stairway and finally
replaced all the individual room smoke alarms.

Maybe the residents of Gaines have been dealing with having
construction workers wandering the hallways, entering rooms with
no prior notice to the residents to install the new fire alarms or to in-
spect furniture or do any number of smaller jobs.

Maybe the residents of Gaines have been awakened at all hours of
the morning by construction crews cutting bricks or drilling holes in
walls or nailing things together, or awakened at all hours of the
night by building fire alarms which go off for no apparent reason,
such as this morning at about 2:30 a.m. Maybe the scarier thing is
that at times when the alarm does go off, people literally sleep right
through it without hearing a thing.

Maybe the residents of Gaines contracted to live there expecting
to have full use of the computer facilities, which were not installed
until halfway through the year, or the weight room, which was not
ready in September.

Maybe the residents of Gaines had been led to believe that there
would be more than two kitchens in the dorm for the use of nearly
250 residents, and maybe residents of Gaines thought it to be a
reasonable expectation that there not be mice inside the building,
and that toilets would not get stopped up on a regular basis.

Maybe the residents of Gaines are entitled to a partial refund on
their room rent for the year, as they did not receive all the benefits
‘ understood in their room contract.

Maybe the contractor, J.M. Turner Co., will finish a job on time
one day. They certainly haven’t succeeded in completing the Gil-
liam Admissions House on schedule, either.

And maybe, just maybe, when it comes time to select a contractor
for the Performing Arts Center, W&L will choose one who can
fulfill an agreement and have a building completed when they have
promised it.

This will be the last issue of The Ring-tum Phi for the 1987-88

As I begin my last article of the
academic year, my hand trembles just
as Daniel Webster's did when he star-
ted the last page of the unabridged dic-
tionary. Many historians believe
Dan’s hand was trembling because he
was nostalgic and sad that his work
was nearing completion. But recently
uncovered documents reveal that
Dan’s trembling stemmed from ex-
citement over some beers he stashed

life forms have had their heroes. Even
low life forms such as blue green al-
gae and humans have heroes. How
one becomes a hero and how heroes
are distinguished from the masses are
questions that must be answered. In
scientific terms a hero is someone who
makes his friends look bad and is
therefore allowed to mate with the en-
tire herd, pack, or suburb. Humans
usually make their friends look bad by
performing a marvelous feat which
their friends cannot emulate. Eating a
three speed bike with a banana seat for

time.”’

Here’s a copy of the letter I wrote
back:

‘‘Dear State Dept.:

I am ignoring your comments con-
cerning my personal friends. The
president's friends embarrass me, but
do I ever mention it? Now here’s the
information you needed on the W&L
community. The student body, once
beyond the iron claw of the oppressive
Executive Committee, will embark on
a summer of vandalism, drug use, fist
fights, shoplifting and anything else
considered deviant by moral majority
advocates. I know the forecast looks
grim but wait—it gets worse. Because
by the time you read this letter mem-
bers of the faculty and administration
will be exchanging their polyester
pants, starchy suits and fat ties for critical. Here’s what my first English
torn blue jeans and leather jackets as professor had to say about my first es-

because it’s a marvelous feat and'most
friends don’t have the digestive tract,

selves. A heroic feat far more difficult
than eating bikes and one that I will
discuss at length concerns college. As
many of you probably guessed the
heroic feat I mean is fulfilling re-
quired college curriculum. Any stu-
dent who can actually do this defin-
itely deserves to mate with his (or her)
whole suburb.

One of the most painful parts of col-
lege curriculum is the English litera-
ture requirements. English classes are
usually fine until the unsuspecting
freshman writes his first paper. The
problem with writing essays is that
English professors can be a little

Because my correspondence with
the State Dept. speaks for itself, I will
move on to other topics.

You know, college isn’t for everyone.
If Herman Melville had known people
like you would write essays like this

about him he probably would have gi-
ven up writing and worked for the
government. Giving you a C minus on
this paper is charity. I deserve a tax
break! The only good thing about this
paper is the topic and I assigned it!”’

Another aspect of college curricu-
lum is the greatly feared laboratory
science requirement. Due to the fact
that both my parents have science-
related degrees, I figured that I
couldn’t perform too poorly in a col-
lege science class so instead of ‘‘Dirt
Ecology’’ I took a pre-med biology
class. (Pre-med basically means that a
student taking sucha class under-
stands that he or she will be studying
incredibly boring subjects 12 hours a
night for the next 12 years.) In the bio-
logy class I soon learned that even
though my parents were good at
science they carried the ‘‘bad at scien-
ce’’ gene recessively; and when they
had me these recessive traits hooked-
up. Non-scientific translation for poe-
try majors: even if your father is Al-
bert Einstein and every other relative
is a Nobel prize winner in science,
you can still fail high school Earth
Science. It was during the first labora-
tory exercise that I realized that I was
a scientific idiot. The rest of the class
did the lab in twenty minutes. I strug-
gled with my microscope for three
hours until the instructor finally came
over (probably he wanted to deter-
mine what type of mental retardation
afflicted my brain) to help me get star-
ted. His first suggestion was that I turn
on the microscope light. At that point I
knew I had problems.

English and Science are tough re-
quirements to fulfill, but compared to
math, they were a cinch. In my case,
the math requirement reared its ugly
head in the form of calculus. To pass a
calculus class one requires the bore-
dom capacity of a rock. Not only is

 

LETTERS
Senior has his final say on coeducation

calculus boring, but it is perhaps the
most irrelevant thing since a seed-spit-
ting contest. Knowing this, imagine
how surprised I was when a calculus
teacher told me that my articles are ir-
relevant. Of course, the teacher was
correct. Everything I write is irrele-
vant, but irrelevance is relative and
compared to calculus, my articles are
the most relevant invention since the
electric can opener. Wait a second!
Maybe I’ve been too hard on calculus.

Actually, it’s very useful to the econ-"

omy because it keeps people from
quitting their boring jobs. Winston,
the:beer mug-inspector and his career
dilemma exhibits the point. One morn-
ing Winston woke up and decided to
quit his job inspecting beer mugs for
leaks because it is so boring. Suddenly
he remembers how much worse the
calculus class he took in college was
and ends up going to work thankful to
have such an interesting job. Thanks
to calculus America still makes quality
beer mugs.

The moral of my story on heroic
acts is that it is much easier to become
a hero by eating a three speed bike
with a banana seat than fulfilling re-
quired college curriculum.

The last important topic of this arti-
cle is a question which gets to the very
heart of everything bad journalism
stands for: ‘‘Why does Jon Sbar per-
sist in writing articles which violate
every law of responsible journalism?”
Unfortunately, the reader’s guess is as
good as mine, but if it’s any comfort a
team of America’s best psychiatrists is
currently working on the problem. In
closing out the year, I would like to
end with the immortal words of War-
ren Dunn, world famous philosopher,
womanizer, and skateboarder, *‘Life
is a fruit to be eaten because if you
don’t it will get squashed under
someone’s foot.’’

 

 

fo the Editors:

I wish to call attention to some of the most seri-
ous problems facing our university, but first I
must address the source of our difficulties; coedu-
cation.

Why were females allowed to infest the Colon-
nade? The university has consistently responded
with the following; W&L is not attracting the ca-
liber of students it prefers. My contention is that
there is always more than one solution to a prob-
lem. W&L should have recruited prospective stu-
dents more intensively. While many of my fellow
seniors are from Virginia and neighboring states,
very few came into contact with a W&L rep-
resentative. Although many came to visit W&L,
even more didn’t, and a sizeable majority never
even heard of Saint Bob’s University. W&L took
the easy way out and now we are paying dearly
for it.

One only needs to look at the 1987-88 academic
year to observe the divisiveness that now pervades
our hallowed halls, e.g., the Fancy Dress scandal,
the sorority dispute, the Trident controversy-
Winter Slosh & Confetti's and so on. W&L has
traditionally been attended by conservative Repu-
blican God-fearing men. If you didn’t know that
when you decided to enroll, you can blame Wash-
ington Hall for their completely inadequate re-

cruitment policy. If you don’t like it...get the hell
out.

By appealing to a wider base of prospective stu-
dents, W&L is the prime culprit in allowing th.
commie pinko liberals (synonyms) to flood the
conservative halls of our institution. If you fear
the red tide lapping at America’s shores, you bet-
ter be prepared to do battle right here in Lexing-
ton. I implore the male population at W&L to sus-
tain and intensify the crusade against coeducation,
and in the words of Gen. Douglas MacArthur,
‘There is no substitute for victory.’’ Although I
believe there is a place for women in the world,
the only position female students should occupy at
W&L is prone. Washington & Lee has turned its
back on us, one only need wonder whether in 15
years we will do the same.

Mark A. Keene ‘88
Al celebrates human rights

To the Editors:
It is sad that in a time and age in which we have
the most to offer to the world, that we think so

little of it outside of our cozy little existence. We
have everything at our fingertips and very few of
us seek to use this for the betterment of others. On
Monday evening, the Rev. Benoni Ogwal and his
wife, Alice Ogwal, and Prof. Neville Richardson
and his wife, Carleen Richardson, gave a moving
testimony to the abuses of basic human rights that
we take for granted in our world of BMW’s and
Wednesday-night parties.

They spoke of the suffering and seemingly
hopeless plight of people in parts of Africa. Alth-
ough their message was bleak, the spark of hope
that underlined it can be turned into a raging fire,
if people can learn to think beyond themselves and
care for others. Join Amnesty International this
Saturday, weather permitting, along with Live
Drive, as we will be having an all-day concert in
front of Lee Chapel. Food and drinks will be ser-
ved until we run out. Together we can make that
spark grow.

Sincerely,
Kevin D. McNamara ‘88

Ethics

 

es Ps _
By W. Patrick Hinely/W&L

Dr. Robert T. Schooley, associate professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School
and a W&L alumnus, discussed AIDS research with W&L students, faculty, and other
medical professionals during the annual Medical Ethics Institute, held at the university last
weekend. The institute is part of W&L’s program in applied ethics, ‘‘Society and the

Professions.’’

Students split history award

 

From Staff Reports

 

Two W&L students, Kevin L.
Yeager of Mercersburg, Pa., and John
H. Starks Jr. of Valdosta, Ga., have
been named co-recipients of the So-
ciety of the Cincinnati Award.

The award, established in honor of
the Society of Cincinnati in the State
of Virginia, is conferred by the faculty
of W&L on the author of the best es-
say in American military history or
some other subject in Colonial, Revo-
lutionary or Civil War history of the
United States. For the first time since
its establishment, the Cincinnati
Award is being conferred on two stu-

dents.

Yeager, a junior history major, was
honored for his paper, ‘‘For ‘A
National Union More Complete’:
John Brown Gordon, the Legacy of
the Civil War and Sectional Recon-
ciliation.’’ Yeager was also the reci-
pient of the Cincinnati Award in 1987.
He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. David
R. Yeager of Mercersburg.

Starks, a senior majoring in
classics, was honored for his paper,
‘**This Ancient and Venerable Seat of
the Muses: the Classics at the Eight-
eenth Century Precursors of Washing-
ton and Lee University.’’ Starks is the
son of Mr. and Mrs. John Starks of
Valdosta, Ga.

Former Justice Lewis Powell
will address law graduation

 

From Staff Reports

 

Retired U.S. Supreme-Court Justice
Lewis F. Powell Jr. will deliver the
address at commencement exercises
of the W&L School of Law on Sun-
day, May 22.

The ceremony will be held at 2:30
p.m. on the lawn in front of the Presi-
dent’s House. In the event of rain, the
ceremony will be moved to Warner
Center.

W&L expects to award juris doctor
degrees to 117 third-year students.
This will be the university’s 133rd
graduating law class.

Powell received his undergraduate
degree (1929) and law degree (1931)
from W&L. He received his master of
laws degree from Harvard University

and received an honorary degree from
WA&L in 1960. One of the university’s
most distinguished and loyal alumni,
Powell served-onits’board of trustees
from 1961 to 1978.

Powell was admitted to’the Virginia
Bar Association in 1931. He was a
member of the Special Charter Com-
mission for the City of Richmond in
1947 and the Governor’s Advisory
Council on the Virginia Economy,
and is a former president of the Amer-
ican Bar Association. He also served
as chairman of the Richmond Public
School Board.

Powell practiced law in Richmond
for 34 years before accepting the
nomination to the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1972 at the age of 64. He re-
tired from the Supreme Court last
June.

practices, according to the Washing-
ton Post.

Specifically, Deaver was convicted
of lying to the House Energy and
Commerce oversight committee about
his role in setting up a meeting be-
tween a South Korean trade rep-
resentative and President Reagan, the
Post reported.

He was also convicted of lying to
the grand jury about contacts he made
with government officials on behalf of
Trans World Airlines and about his
efforts to help Puerto Rico retain a
federal tax benefit, according to the
Post.

Deaver faced up to I5 years in
prison and $22,000 in fines, but his
sentencing, originally set for Feb. 25,
was delayed by challenges to the con-

stitutionality of the law that created
independent counsellors.

During the highly publicized trial,
Deaver’s lawyers decided to offer no
defense, because they believed the
prosecutor’s case was weak and be-
cause Judge Thomas Jackson disal-
lowed much of the evidence they had
planned to use to show Deaver was
under the effects of alcoholism when
he originally testified, according to
the Post.

Deaver began his association with
the president during the 1960s, when
Reagan was governor of California.
Deaver first worked as a cabinet se-
cretary and went on to serve as an as-
sistant to the governor and director of
administration.

Since leaving the White House,
Deaver wrote Behind the Scenes, an
insider’s look at the workings of the
Reagan presidency.

Tonight’s speech is open to the pub-
lic and will be followed by a reception
in Fairfax Lounge in the University
Center.

The student who resides with the Ju

ing the academic school year, is in for
a unique experience. He may take les-

dents per class is limited to ten.

Students may learn just about any
type of art from Ju, from landscapes
to flower paintings. There are many
varicties of flowers to draw from

growing in the garden beside the gal-
lery.

Mrs. Ju offers cooking lessons as
well. Many of the meals fixed at the Ju
household will likely have been pre-
pared by one of the students, with the
instruction and assistance of Mrs. Ju.

June is one of the busiest times of
the year, when students come to live
with Ju and take lessons from him.
His pupils aren't just limited to W&L
students, either.

Ju says adult students from around
the Lexington area take summer and
weekend lessons, and still more travel
from as far away as Washington,
D.C. to take lessons on a weekly
basis.

beautiful nature spread out across
some eight acres of land make this
place different than the usual gallery

Two W&L students earn philosophy awards

 

From Staff Reports

 

Two W&L students have been
awarded prizes for their excellent
scholarship in philosophy.

Gregg W. Kettles, a senior from
Colorado Springs, Colo., has been
named the recipient of the Young
Scholarship, which is conferred upon
the student attaining the highest record
in a selected course in philosophy.
Kettles plans to enter Yale Law
School next fall. He is the son of Mr.
and Mrs. William Kettles of Colorado
Springs.

Henry H. Hyatt. a senior from Rose

Hill, has been awarded the Edward A
Dodd Award. Hyatt is the first reci
pient of the Dodd Award, which was
recently established in memory or
Edward A. Dodd, a 1967 W&L gra-
duate who died in 1985. Hyatt will
continue graduate study in philosophy
at the University of California at Santa
Barbara. He is the son of Frederick D.
Hyatt of Rose Hill, and Sandra Berry
of Ocracoke, N.C.

The Edward A. Dodd Award was
established through the generous con-
tributions of W&L alumni who were
friends and classmates of Dodd. The
Edward A. Dodd Award is presented
annually to the graduating W&L
senior whose senior thesis exemplifies

the highest standards in the study of
philosophy.

According to the description of the
award, the recipient should possess
the qualities Dodd demonstrated while
he was a student at W&L. Among
these qualities are ‘‘academic excel-
lence motivated by a concern for ideas
for their own sake, vigor in intellec-
tual-pursuit and resilience in the face
of criticism, good will toward others
encouraging them to higher achieve-
ment, and courage in the face of mis-
fortune.”

W&L, Professor of Philosophy Harr-
ison H. Pemberton Jr., said of Dodd,

New Zealand political scientist
Nigel Roberts will speak on size
and democracy in 121 Commerce
School at 2:00 p.m. on Thursday,

by the Politics dept. and the public
invited.

This illustrated lecture probes
the appropriate scale for a demo-

popular articles as well as radio
scripts on the outstanding issues
facing democracy—especially pol-
itical tolerance, electoral change,
the media, and women’s rights.

Roberts has met these issues
head-on as a refusenik from South
Africa. Professors are asked to an-
nounce this rare and timely visit to
their classes. Contact Professor

vid Frederick, W&L’s No. 6 player,

freshman Bill Meadows, hung tough
. in the second set. Morris pushed the

Slug to a tie-breaker before stalling.
_ Frederick pushed the ‘Slugs’ lead to
+ 4-2 with his 7-6 (7-5) second set win.

The championship would now be de-

cided in the doubles competition,

W&L head coach Gary Franke was

» concerned about his doubles combina-
tions. Due to time constraints placed
on the teams by the rainy conditions,
only one W&L doubles pairs had
played a match during the tournament
(Wiman and Morris won
Emory on Monday).

Needing a sweep to win the crown,
the Generals, possibly rusty, had their
work cut out for them. Things did
seem to a little out of syne early, as
only Haley and Meadows won their
first set.

At No. 3 for W&L, Haley and
Meadows gave the slumping Generals
some much-needed momentum with a
straight set win over UCSC’s An-
drews and John Browning. The W&L
duo needed a tie- breaker before win-
ning the first set 7-6 (7-5). The two
oT then went on to take the second

. The team score moved to 4-3 as

against

the Generals marched on.

Matthews and McLeod spotted Na-
gle and Einbinder the first set, losing
4-6. Action got intense in the second,
as the cornered W&L pair scrapped to
keep its team in the hunt. Santa Cruz
had its only championship point in the
second set, with the ‘Slugs serving at
5 games to 4. In that tenth game, the
score went to 3-all before Matthews
and McLeod denied the Slugs the
national title.

Breaking UCSC’s No. | pair, Matt-
hews and McLeod stomped on the
gas, securing the second set in a 9-7
tie breaker and then smoking the
‘Slugs in the third set, 6-2. The Gen-
erals remained alive, tying the fierce
competition at 4-4. The small but
vocal W&L crowd pushed its team
further on.

Wiman and Morris, W&L’s com-
bination punch at No. 2, also allowed
their opponents an early lead. UCSC’s
Roberts and Frederick jumped out
quickly, breezing to a 6-3 first set vic-
tory.

Again the Generals found their
hopes flickering. The No. 2 W&L
pair kept the ‘Slugs from any cham-
pionship points, winning the long sec-
ond set 7-6 (9-7) in a heart-wrenching
tie breaker. Wiman and Morris earned
the right to play in that tie breaker
after gallantly fighting back from a 4
games to | deficit. Following much
the same pattern as the No. | game,

the ’Slugs folded in the third set. The
W&L pair closed out the team compe-
tition, winning the third set 6-3.

Franke was excited with the big
win, and said that ‘‘it couldn’t have
happened to a nicer group of young
men.’’. The frustration of two consecu-
tive second-place finishes drained
from the players’ faces as Morris’
clinching serve was shanked into the
net by the ‘Slugs. Washington and Lee
had won its first ever national title.

Rain also played havoc with the
Generals’ semifinal contest against
Swarthmore on Tuesday.

W&L clinched a spot in the final
battle for the national title by winning
all five singles matches played.

Haley’s match at No. 2 against
Steve Tignor was called due to rain,
and doubles play was not begun.

The Generals, seeded second in the
tournament, had a bye on Sunday, the
first day of play. Old foe Emory
greeted W&L on Monday afternoon.
The No. 10 Eagles had upset No. 7
Claremont to advance.

W&L won the match 5-2, with
Matthews losing to singles power Ji-
mmy Strauss [6-4, 6-7 (7-9), 1-6] at
No. | and Meadows dropping to
Emory’s Chris Walser 6-3, 4-6, 4-6.
W&L’s five wins all came in straight
sets. W&L had beaten Emory during
regular season play 8-1.

“Abe Tifé span (in monthsf ofa hea

 

 

Something strange happened last night in a small racquet club in
Staunton. One would almost liken the occurrence to a miracle.

The Generals were beaten. W&L trailed 4-2 after the singles competi-
tion against the Banana Slugs of the University of California-Santa Cruz
in the Division II Men’s Tennis Championships. Surely the *Slugs
would wrap up the team title in the doubles. All they needed was a single
victory in one of the three matches.

Any glimmer of a possible miracle was quickly darkened as the No. |
and No. 2 doubles tandems for UCSC jumped out to an early lead, grab-
bing the first set in their respective matches. Before the Generals could
even regroup the “Slugs had widened their advantage, with both teams
breaking W&L’s serve. Only the No. 3 doubles team of junior Robert
Haley and freshman Bill Meadows seemed out of danger, winning its
match in straight sets.

All UCSC had to do was hold serve, something it had done quite well
all afternoon and evening, and it would have the national title. For the
Generals, the defeat would mean the third consecutive year of finishing
second in the nation.

As the “Slugs prepared to close out the match, I looked at my watch,
which said 10:31. An omen perhaps? If you add the first three digits and
divide by thelast one you come up with the number 4, which is the aver-

‘itthy Banana Stig. It 1 also the number

of sets the Generals needed for a nstonal utle.

Nah, it wasn’t an omen. The Generals were finished—history. Some
Santa Cruz fans edged towards the doors leading to the courts, anticipat-
ing the forthcoming celebration. W&L supporters started wondering
how far junior Bobby Matthews and senior David McLeod would go in
the doubles competition later in the week. Nope, it was over. Pack up
the bus. Send them home.

I envisioned the next day's headline. ‘‘General’s choke :n finals.
What else is new?’’ At a school where ‘tyakkin’ at the bone’’ (as one
person puts it) has become almost as common place as white columns
and anti-coed letters, it would probably come as no surprise that the
Generals had lost again.

What happened over those next fateful SO minutes was something to
behold. I have never experienced anything like it. To traverse from the
depths of failure to the heights of success in a mere 3000 seconds just
couldn't be done. The Generals were out of it. They could barely hold
their own serve, less not break the opposition’s.

Throughout the history of sport, people have labeled certain sporting
events as “‘the greatest comeback ever."’ What 30 some odd people say
yesterday at that tiny little indoor tennis facility would certainly chal-
lenge any claim to that title.

No, the Generals did not choke. Instead they conjured up some magic,
made a few gut checks and pulled off the most incredible clutch I’ve
ever seen. It was if a divine power sucked up the confidence and mo-
mentum from the Santa Cruz players and dumped them into the Gen-
eral’s laps.

I guess the omen wasn’t that silly equation I came up with after look-
ing at my watch. The real omen was the drinking cup I picked up at one
of those everything’s-a-dollar stores in the shopping mall during the
two-hour break between the singles and doubles. At the time, I saw that
drinking cup as just a meaningless trinket. Now, it represents the victory
cup from which everyone can drink from and celebrate this absolutely
incredible performance.

Here’s a toast first, however, to the players from Santa Cruz. You
didn’t choke. Remember, it’s not everyday you have to play a miracle.

Faust Food

Lexington gets a new taste of China

 

By Jason Faust

Staff Reporter

 

Chinese food is back and is better
than ever, unfortunately you're going
to have to pay for it. It took just one
day to hear that the rumors were true
to start calling and harassing the orien-
tal man on the other end of the line to
open as quickly as possible. Then the
day finally came...Hunan Gardens
had opened its doors for business!!
The grand occasion filled Lexington’s
chinese-food-void created by the
dearly departed Aloha Wok about two
years ago, a grim occasion which until
now was sadly mourned by many
seniors.

Now, I don’t know how difficult
Chinese food is to cook; It seems to
me that anything stir-fried is going to
taste delicious. In fact, I can’t re-
member ever having any bad Chinese
food and after more than a few trips to
Hunan Gardens | still can’t. To put it
frankly, the food is wonderful and
recommend everything on the menu
except for the dishes with peanuts, but

Colors, colors, colors. Blacks,
whites, reds, yellows and browns.
The Reds. The Blues. The Crips and
the Bloods.

With every new month, it seems,
comes a new ‘‘Buzz Word’’ for the
80s. First it was yuppy, then it was
AIDS and Crack. What next? Some-
thing that needs no abbreviation and
something that cannot be smoothed
over with a sugar-coated colloquial-
ism. The new ‘‘Buzz Word’’ for the
80s is ‘‘Street Gang.”’

What was once a not-so-serious,
pseudo-tough, don’t push me or Ill
push you turf battle between the Jets
and the Sharks with zip-guns and
switchblades has become an epidemic-
sized drug war among American
youths involving Uzi machine guns,
grenades, 9mm handguns and over
70,000 youths in Los Angeles alone.

Gang violence has once again risen
out of the streets and it is more serious
and more deadly than it has ever been
before. It was part of the cover story
for Time magazine two weeks ago, a
major story in a Rolling Stone-like
British publication called Sky last
month and is the subject of the new
Dennis Hopper film Colors that is
taking Hollywood by storm.

Colors is the story of a wet-nosed
special forces cop (Sean Penn) who
joins forces with a veteran policeman
(Robert DuVall) to learn the ropes on
how to crack down on the gang wars
exploding all over Los Angeles.

Just as he showed us in Apocalypse
Now and in his Oscar-winning per-

this is a personal bias and in no way
should influence your decision. Many
people enjoy seafood dishes, as do I
but, when you can choose from a
number of spicy entres such as Beef in
Garlic sauce, Hunan Two Step, and
Szechuan Pork the seafood sounds and
tastes somewhat bland. Though the
consistency of the spiciness has varied
the two times I ordered the Beef in
Garlic sauce, keep in mind that if you
don't care for really hot foods you
may ask the waitress to pass the word
onto the sometimes over-zea'ous
cook. Thus you have no reason not 9
try anything on the menu.

The menu includes appetizers whicn
I have found, to my dismay, rather
sub par in comparison to the main di-
shes. The egg roll is the standard $1
egg roll. When I went for the first
time I was enticed by the exotic sound-
ing Beef Yakitori. Unfortunately it
was basically, a stripe of beef on an
oversized toothpick which you eat
after heating it over a Sterno, I mean
open flame. I did manage to jazz it up
with soy but it was still dry and not
very tender and at $2.25 a pop, some-
thing I will consider next time. I did
enjoy the Pu Pu tray for two which‘
comes with a plethora of friend things
including two spare ribs and yes two

formance in Tender Mercies, Robert
DuVall again displays the talent that
has included him in the fraternity of
America’s finest actors. His portrayal
of the fatherly Hodges is played just as
you would expect a laid-back cop to
act; caring but tough enough to con-
trol any situation he must handle. In
short, DuVall is nearly perfect.

Unfortunately, as is often the case
in film, when one actor shows serious
maturity over previous roles, perfect
performances are neglected. In regard
to DuVall’s performance inColors,
this is what happens.

In Colors, Sean Penn finally reaches
the potential that many critics said he
had after his portrayal of Spicoli in
Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Since
then a series of obstacles (getting ar-
rested numerous times, marrying Ma-
donna and acting in such utter disas-
ters as Shanghai Surprise to name a
few) have limited Penn’s acceptance
in the golden circles of Hollywood.
Colors may change all that.

Penn’s performance as the wet-
nosed, hard-headed Pac-man, as he
was called on the streets, was no ques-
tion his finest since Fast Times and
probably of his career. For the first
time, he shows us that Sean Penn can
play emotions and is not merely one-
dimensional. His character de-
velopment, the control over his emo-
tions and the thorough maturation of
his character throughout the film is in-
credibly well-done.

Colors succeeds because DuVall
and Penn succeed; yet, without strong
performances from them the film may
have worked due to its utter poig-
nancy. Gang violence is increasing
and Colors deals with what we must
do to stop it. Last year in Los Angeles
alone 387 people were killed as a re-
sult of gang violence including in-

Beef Yakitori’s but for $7.95 it is
plenty of food, as an appetizer goes, to
accompany Chinese dish more than
adequately.

But all is not so charming in Lexing-
ton’s Chinatown. To me, a Chinese
restaurant should be dimly lit and real-
ly tacky. Hunan Gardens, to my cha-
grin, is not; it is brightly illuminated
by numerous florescent lights with not
even a toke candle burning in a weird
bamboo thing, for the lack of better
descriptive words. The walls painted,
not a brilliant disgusting Buddhist red-
orange, but white of all colors. (I per-

sonally would like to see murals of

Venetian city-scapes on an aqua-blue
background...well maybe not aqua-
blue) The walls are void of the any ar-
tifacts from the T’ang dynasty or at
least something that can be claimed to
be from the 1980s. There aren't even
bizarre red and gold things hanging
from the ceiling. I may be pushing
things a bit but these are the effects
that make a Chinese meal complete. |
can joyfully say, however, you do sit
in the notorious vinyl-covered chairs
that make that distinctive sound when
you try to get up that in Europe signi-
fies a very satisfied customer.

But to be serious again, Hunan Gar-
dens’s reservation policy leaves some-

fants, five-year-olds and numerous
innocent bystanders. It is an epidemic
that is sweeping over our nation but it
remains to be seen if anyone can find

The Ring-tum Phi, May 19, 1988

thing to be desired. It is basically as
follows: if they can fill a vacant able
five minutes before your reservation it
will be filled. One night we waited an
hour to be seated because another
party strolled in an hour later than
their reservation time and because we
were ten minutes early instead of an
hour they were seated ahead of
us...thank China for Tsing Tao beer.
What I am trying to write is if you
want to eat at Hunan Gardens on the
weekend make reservations and arrive
early. Also, thought he food is great,
you are going to drop a few bucks:
soups and appetizers run from $1.00
to $7.95 and main dishes run about
$5.95 to $9.95 (though one or two di-
shes may cost more). The capper to
any dinner bill is drinks and they are
not cheap. It is so easy to get carried
away and order numerous Flaming
Volcanoes, which will do the trick but
dent your wallet $5.95 a shot. If you
are on the budget plan get carry-out.
The prices aren’t cheaper but you will
eliminate the cost of drinks and I be-
lieve the portions are larger. If the
budget is really strained but you are
determined to eat Chinese, order car-
ry-out at lunchtime and eat then or
microwave it later (Stop-In has a real-
ly nice one if you don’t.)

Colors paints an ugly picture

the cure. After all, as the theme from
the film says, ‘‘We will never die,
We'll only multiply!”’
