THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Ross L. Malone, recently ap-
pointed rector of the univer-
sity, died Aug, 18 in Roswell,

Mex,, at the age of 63.

Malone, who had served on
the board of trustees of Wash-
ington and Lee since 1967, was
named rector, or chairman,
during the last academic year.

A former president of the

American Bar Association, the
1932 graduate was vice presi-

dent of General Motors Corp.
at the time of his death. He
was GM's” general counsel
(head of its legal staff) until
early August, when he gave
up that position for reasons of
health,

Mr. Malone is survived by
his wife, Ami Malone; by a sis-

', Mrs. Edna Malone Schwarz

of Ruidoso, N. Mex., and by
three brothers, Baynard W.

Mr. Malone's death came just

four days before he was to
have received the American
Bar Association’s Medal, the

ABA’s highest honor, at its an-
nual meeting in Honolulu, The
citation prepared for Mr. Ma-
lone spoke of his “unequaled
integrity and quiet determina-
tion” and said he “helped im-
measurably to define and up-

grade our professional respon-
sibility.”

The citation credited Malone
with leading the drive for con-
tinuing education for lawyers
and it noted his role in draft-
ing the 25th Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution.

He was president of the
American Bar Association in
1958-59 and was deputy U. 5.
Attorney General in 1952-53.
Before joining General Motors
in 1967, he was in private law
practice in Roswell.

Malone was _ professionally
active in bar groups in three
countries and was at various
times president or a director
of the American Bar Founda-
tion, the American College of
Trial Lawyers and the Ameri-
can Judicature Society. He was
a task force chairman on the
Hoover Commission and a
member of the Presidential
Commission on Law Enforce-
ment and the American Revo-
lution Bicentennial Commis-
sion in the Johnson admini-
stration,

He was chairman of Wash-
ington and Lee’s law school
development committee since
its ineeption in 1972. That
group has raised more than
$11.7 million to date against
its 1976 objective of $14.5 mil-

isolate the freshmen more, to es-
tablish stringent contact rules, so
that all fraternities will have an
equal chance to rush freshmen.”

Ramey added that providing ex-
plicit times when freshmen can
and cannot be contacted by fra-
ternity members allows the new
students more time to attend to
their studies.

As a result of the IFC’s wish to
strengthen enforcement of exist-
ing rushing rules, fines are stif-
fened and extra IFC representa-
tives are policing Rush functions
at fraternity houses.

Three houses have been placed
on conduct probation and one
house has been fined for infrac-
tions of no-contact rules.

The registration fee for Rush
is $13.50 again his year. This sum
helps to cover the IFC's cost in
managing the rush program,
which began on September 11th
and will continue through Octo-
ber 4th.

‘Tradition

As we return to campus for another school year we find
that President Huntley has moved out of the traditional home
of Washington and Lee presidents to a private location, His
desire for privacy is understandable. Few people would prob-
ably insist that he should attempt to raise a family a few yards
from the freshman dorms—not the best of all moral influences
for young ladies.

And yet his move gives one pause, The change of location
is not earthshaking in itself, to be sure. It is to a small extent
a break with the past and brings to mind a point we would
like to make at the beginning of the year.

Washington and Lee is a school built on time-honored
traditions, The school has grown in the shadows of two of
America’s greatest leaders and has achieved an academic ex-
cellence which few can boast.

The university has never been one to follow the lead of
institutions or the fashionable trends in education, We
are not ike most other colleges in that we have more to look
back on with pride. We have more than a present and a fu-
ture—-we have a past.

It is important that we remember at all times just how
unique we are and not lose our identity in a foolish attempt to
keep pace with others who change for the sake of modernity
and experimentation, We must be extremely careful in ef-
fecting any change here because we have so much to lose and
can not be sure of what is to be gained.

The present academic year will probably see the reappear-
ance of many issues which could lead to radical changes in
the school as we know it, e.g. coeducation. We hope that in a
desire to change W&L those seeking reform will keep in mind
our achievements to date. [t is often unwise to tamper with a

other

 

good thing and Washington and Lee is undoubtably a good
thing.

Our Policy

We of the Ring-tum Phi aim to make the paper representa-
tive of all facets of life at Washington and Lee, To this end
we will attempt to present all shades of student opinion to
our readers. We invite your comments, criticism and opinions
on any topics of general interest to the university community.

Letters to the editor are welcomed at any time. We only
ask that they be constructive and refer to campus issues. All
letters received will be run unless they are in poor taste, ex-
cessively long or repeat the sentifents of other letters printed
on the same topic,

The editorial policy of this paper will be grounded in a
concern for the best interests of Washington and Lee and in
the maintenance of its traditional high standards.

Once again, your help in our endeavor to make the Ring-
tum Phi a student newspaper would be greatly appreciated.

It is too bad that the students
weren't here to share the folly.
The rallies would have been boi-
sterous and the parades with Mel
Greenberg banners would have
furnished such excitement as to
make Macy’s Thanksgiving pro-
cession seem inconsequential.
Fraternities would have held
“Free Mel Greenberg parties” and
perhaps even a new potable,—
say a Greenberger; drink it and
see stars—would have brewed in
one of the Greek houses.

Mr. Twain, the sure-talking ‘“mov-

Lexington this summer that reads
like one of the stories from
America’s beloved humorist.

He came to make a movie he
told everyone, and at times the
fifty-two year old man must have
believed it himself. He put an ad-
vertisement in the local paper
announcing that he would he in-

the dreams that pervaded the
minds of students, housewives,
teachers, husbands, and others
who interrupted their regular
schedules to go out and see Mr.
Greenberg at the Keydet-General
Motel.

This mysterious stranger stirr-
ed more excitement with pro-
mises of Hollywood stardom in
Lexington. Names like Burt Lan-
caster, Kirk Douglas, Audrey
Hepburn, and Phil Silvers were
daunting skeptics, and enthrall-
ing the believers. Local motel
rooms were reserved for coming
Hollywood crews. Two secretaries
were hired for Mr. Greenberg.
Approximately 500 to 800 people
were needed as extras, mostly in
battlefield scenes. And the word
got around about the "$12,000

buxom and talented women (36

Hopes of stardom frustrated

Lexington back on the map. The
story of the hoax hit the Associat-
ed Press lines and soon every
major newspaper in the country
had the opportunity to discover
Lexington, Va. Correspondents
from major national magazines
came to Lexington to investigate;
newscasters from area and na-
tional networks brought film
crews to show America what hap-
pened in Lexington, Virginia. In-
deed, Mel’s promises of publicity
came true,

Mel Greenberg was arrested in
Hillsboro, Ohio on the eighteenth
of June. By that time Greenberg
had become to some Lexington-
ians sort of a folk hero, Admira-

his deceptional skills, and his abil-

All humor is based on man’s

Theatre opens new season

by Barney Skelton

While the fall season at the
University Theatre holds in store
for the Washington and Lee audi-
ence a thematic format which is
similar to that of last years, the
productions should prove far from
repitious. Equus, by Peter Shaf-
fer, and Don Juan, by Moliere,
echo the preceding year’s Fall
plavbill in that: 1) playwright
Shaffer's Reyal Hunt of the
Sun was the first production, and
Was, as is Kquus, a philosophical
challenge to Christianity; and 2)
Sir George Etherege’s Man of
Mode, although written later in
the century, was a 17th century
comedy of manners as is Don
Juan, However, the similarities
diminish in stature when one ex-
amines the particularities of each
of the plays.

Equus, opposed to Royal Hunt,
is a play of words not action. Al-
though it contains mime in some
of its seenes, the basic plotline
revolves around what is a physi-
cally statie situation. A psychiat-
rist is attempting to help a dis-
turbed boy who is haunted by a
horse god he calls Equus, ‘Thus
most of the seript is dialogue. In
contrast, one of the most poig-
nant leitmotifs of Reyal Hunt was
the incessant marching of Pizarro
and his men, indefatigably track-
ing down the Inca god-man Ata-
hualpa. A further, and more obvi-
ous distinction between the two
plays is that Equus is a realistic
drama in a modern-day setting,
while Reyal Hunt was somewhat
of a pageant, set in the 16th cen-
tury.

Of course, the major difference
between Man of Mode and Don
Juan is that the former is an Eng-
lish play, while the latter is
French. Even though they were
written In roughly the same per
lod, this difference in nationality

In case you weren't, aren’t, or
haven't been made aware of it,
Washington and Lee had a foot-
ball game Saturday.

But maybe you'd be better off
not knowing too much about it.

The Generals, now in Phase II
of their rebuilding program,
were overwhelmed by Millersville
State (Pa.), 306, in their 1974
season opener. The loss extended

the two-season losing string to
eight, but head coach Bill Me-
llenry said nothing to indicate

that the end of the streak was far
off.

“Sure we're disappointed, but
we're not at all discouraged,” the
second year mentor lamented af-
ter the game. “We were beaten
by a fine football team which
dominated us in almost every as-
pect of the game.”

Yet domination might not be a
strong enough term to describe
the Maraders’ control of the

game, Millersville, behind quar-

Dennis Booker, who at 6’3 and
250 pounds outweighed and out-
sized any W&L player, amassed
536 total offensive yards, while
W&L netted only 152 yards, a fi-

big pressure all afternoon, hit on
18 of 47 passes for 178 yards. In-
cluded in the total was the lone
W&L touchdown, a_ three-yard
strike to junior receiver Mark
George in the third quarter.

McHenry termed the perform-
ance of his corps of receivers the
lone bright spot on offense.

“George (six catches for 71
yards), Tony Perry (six catches
for 58 yards), and Kamon Cassell
(three catches for 38 yards) did
an excellent job of catching the
football,” MeHenry said,

Cassell was one of six fresh-
men who were in Saturday’s
starting lineup. In all, 11 mem-
bers of the classes of 1977 and
1978 got the nod for the opening
whistle. But McHenry did not
blame any lack of experience for
the defeat.

“We simply did not execute,
and we did this against a, team
with superior manpower,” Mc-
Henry said, “It all adds up, and
the result has to be obvious.”

The Marauders got on the score-
board late in the first period. Af-
ter a Berry pass fell into enemy
hands, they drove 30 yards in five
plays, with Burke going the final
six yards for the score. Barry
Brunner’s kick made it 7-0.

The Generals were forced to
punt, and on the ensuing posses-
sion it took Millersville only three
aerial strikes to score. Burke
connected on passes of 23 and
seven yards, then found flanker

early in the second stanza as
Booker, who totalled 104 yards in

the homestanders took a 19-0 lead

Tough year ahead

by SANDY BISHOP

Depth and experience would
have to be the key factors for a
successful season for Washington
and Lee’s 1974 soccer team.

The Generals face a tough sche-
dule which includes Navy, Gettys-
burg, Lynchburg, and state pow-
er Madison. However, with fif-
teen lettermen returning, Coach
Joe Lyles holds high hopes for a
winning season,

W&L prepped for the season
with two scrimmages, trouncing
Radford, 8-2, and downing a Ger-
man team from Lynchburg, 5-2.
Sharp passing and strong defen-
sive play were evident in both
scrimmages. Lyles hopes such
play will continue throughout the
season.

W&L will use a 3-4-3 formation,
in hopes to dominate the midfield
play while getting the ball to the

attack, Lettermen Billy Cogar,
Doug Hunter, and Jembe Mwa-
kalu, a Kenyan transfer student,
will hold down the front line
spots. Tri-captain Jim Fox, Chuck
Alexander, and John Embree will
anchor the midfield, while all-
state selection Barclay Arm-
strong, another tricaptain, will
head up the defense, Paul Devine,
the third tri-captain, will mind
the nets for the third year. Lyles
feels that sophomores Jeff Barr
and Bob Currie, and junior Jim
Wilson will provide more depth
than the squad had last year.

The Generals open their season
tomorrow against West Virginia
Wesleyan, a newcomer to the
W&L schedule. Lyles is hoping
for a strong start which would
help to carry the spirit and hus-
tle which have marked the pre-
season practice sessions,

early in the third period, After
freshman defensive end Jeff Slat-
coff recovered a Millersville fum-
ble at the W&L 48, the Generals
drove to the Millersville 14, where
after hauling in a Berry pass,
Perry fumbled the ball, with the
Marauders recovering.

But on the next play freshman
linebacker Craig Forry picked off
his second pass of the day and
rambled to the Millersville four.
Three plays later Berry found
George wide open over the mid-
die for the only W&L touchdown.
A pass for a two-point conversion
was picked off, and the Generals
trailed 19-6,

Then Millersville put the game
out of reach. After Berry was
picked off for the second of three
times, the Marauders made it 27-
6 as Steve Schaufert scored from
three yards out, and Gerry Nau
hit Bob Ulrich for the two-point-
er. Brunner closed out the scor-
ing midway through the fourth
quarter with a 22-yard field goal.

Cabbages and kings:
Who can tell the difference?

Washington and lee faces no serious problems at present,
or at least not for the next ten seconds, The school is sound
academically and even sounder socially, Everybody is having
a good time—or could if they wanted to badly enough,

What is it, then, that has kept W&L on an even plane,
that has kept us from becoming another mediocre school
with no personality? The answer is ineredibly simple and
something always overlooked by those who take the time to

look for answers: apathy.

W&L students, for the most part, could not care less
about what HEW is doing to improve or wreck their world.

Let the YR’s and the Birchers worry about that. Student
activism is a disease which has disappeared after its merci-
fully short appearance in the late sixties, After all, gentle-

men have more important things to occupy that sadly limited
period of bliss, their youth,

To begin with, men here have an unsurpassed sense of
proportion. That is to say, they are well-rounded. What W&L
ventleman would allow mere academics to interfere with
road trips or Sunday afternoon parties? For the unquestion-
ably small minority that does not know how to be so frivolous
we can only offer our deepest condolences and pity; you
might as well be jacketed in Western State or playing
pinochle in the Twilight Nursing Home if you are already

starting to take life in earnest.

Everything about life here encourages complete and single-
minded triviality. Lexington cannot be taken seriously by
anybody. Even the city fathers admit this by implication
when they spend their tine figuring out places to put sense
less one-way streets and dreaming about Mel's return with
Hollywood crews, All around us is quaint and picturesque,
VMI looks like a fine old medieval castle (though not so
romantic for those enrolled) and does tend to keep its cadets
occupied with such essential concerns as polishing shoes and
rubbing brass. For those who want vocational training in

these fields it is only steps away.

W&l protects us from the mundane world—not that we

are incapable of handling that—but who really gives a damn
about learning about income-tax returns and having to go
to the office? Let the faculty worry about that. For students

here life is rather idyllic,

However, anything as precious and fragile as our en-
vironment can be irreparably shattered all too easily. If we
want to interrupt our purpose here we have only to question
it in the same way the sociology department questions all
ocial patterns. Why should W&L teach us how to compete

Fraternities are no longer stereotyped and this is indeed

unsettling. In this day and time we have no choice but to

DEAR TRAVELLER—Wateching last week's football game, I have
come to realize that Washington and Lee is not what one would call
a jock school, despite the requirement that everyone take at least
five physical education classes. However, | have heard rumors that
W&L has a sports history of which it can boast, The facts, please.

WEL is
prides

unfounded,
particularly

DEAR SPORTS FAN—Those rumors are not
steeped in sports tradition, and the university
itself on its many sports records. Among them:

—The football team’s incredible string of 123 games without a
shower, 1923-39. The string was broken Oct. 3, 1989 when the team’s
star tackle, 596-pound Marv Fritters, slipped and fell off the foot-
bridge into the river below, drenching not only the entire team but
the campus as well. Many drips can still be seen around campus.

—The 1947 football game against Sweet Briar. Due to a specia
ruling, both teams agreed to play overtime until somebody won.
With 8:52 left in the 21st period, Sweet Briar finally had to call it
quits to get back to the campus in time for 9 p.m, curfew, Hight
plays later the Generals recovered a fumble and scored to win the
game.

—Harry “Simp” Wendleton in 1957 picked off a record 13  base-

runners in a baseball game from his catcher position. Wendleton
was later convicted on 13 murder charges.
—iIn 1954. LaVerne “Stretch” Darwinger scored a school record

18 technical fouls in a game against Randolph-Macon (the record
books do not say whether it was Randy-Mac’s male or female team.)
Darwinger reportedly was ejected from the game after he repeatedly
asked the referee if her (Darwinger) could tie the shoelaces of all
the players on the court. Dadwinger said it was for extra credit
in a weaving course he was failing. Darwinger was the last W&L

student on scholarship at the school, or at least the last one the
school will admit to.
—In 1965, Herbie “Flash” Windjammer set a school and appar-

ently world record in the 100 yard dash with a :064 time. Wind-
jammer was aided in his run by the fact that he was being chased

at the time by Bertha Berwanger, who had just won Southern
Seminary’s birth defect look-alike contest. Windjammer never did
stop.

Madison sustains lead, #*

W&L rally thwarted

By BILL KFLESHER

Sports Kditor

A little bit of everything went
into Washington and Lee’s home
football opener Saturday, but the
end result was the toughest loss
of what is now a nine-game los-
ing streak,

Trailing Madison 24-14 with six
minutes left, the Generals staged
a furious rally to reach the door-
step of vietory—only to have
Ralph Moore’s 27-yard field goal
attempt with :56 left miss by
inches to give the Dukes a 24-22
win in their first varsity game.

A Wilson Field crowd of almost
4,000—many of whom missed the
frantic fourth quarter, when they
opted for the comfort of their
dry living quarters rather than
get a bit wet — saw a wide
open affair in which the two
teams collected 49 first downs,
threw the ball 63 times, and gain-
ed 787 total offensive yards.

Yet it was the alert play of
the defensive units that made the
difference. Of nine turnovers
forced by both defenses, three led
to touchdowns, including the
Dukes’ final six-pointer.

After Madison’s Bob Ward put
the visitors ahead 17-14 with a
27-vard field goal, the Dukes’
Rich Jackson set up the winning
touchdown when he intercepted
a Jack Berry pass and return-
ed it to the W&L 14. Two plays
later, Ron Stith scored from one
yard out to up the lead to 24-14,

But W&L came right back as
Berry engineered a 10-play, 67-
yard scoring drive, throwing to
freshman Eamon Cassell for the
final four yards with 3:03 left.
A Berry pass to Mercer West
earned the two-point conversion,
cutting the Dukes’ lead to 24-22.

A W&L onside kick attempt
then failed. But on the next play,
Stith fumbled. The ball bounced
crazily in the Madison backfield
for several seconds until fresh-
man cornerback Charlie Brown
recovered on the Dukes 27. Four
plays later W&L had moved down
to the 10, but then Berry missed
passes on second and third down.

So, on fourth and six, head
coach Bill McHenry called on
Moore for a field goal attempt

from the 17, The kick easily had
the distance, but stayed just
inches outside the right upright,
and the Generals found them-
selves on the short end of the
final verdict,

The game began the same of-
fensive note that it ended on.
After taking the opening kickoff
W&L marched to the Madison
12, where a drive fizzled when
Berry was sacked on fourth and
l4. Then the Dukes stormed 69
yards in nine plays with Bernard
Slayton, who gained 106 yards in
19 carries, going the final eight
for the touchdown. Ward's kick
made it 7-0,

But the Generals tied the game

  

Moore’s kick got through despite
being deflected, and it was 7-7.

Wé&L grabbed their only lead
on the first play of the second
quarter, When Berry rolled a-
round right end for a two yard
touchdown, The score had been
set up four plays earlier when co-
captain Steve VanAmburgh re-
covered a Slayton fumble on the
Madison 13. Moore added the
extra point to make it 14-7,

But the Dukes almost immedi-
ately scored to tie it at 14-14,
when quarterback Leslie Branich
hit Tom Rabinson with a 25-yard
scoring pass.

There the scoring ended until

the wild and woolly fourth period.
In the meantime it was the de-
fenses who dominated.

Between the touchdown pass
to Robinson and the Ward field
goal, Madison moved inside the
W&L 25 five times, only to come
up empty on each occasion, Three
times the Dukes reached the Gen-
erals’ 3, but a missed field goal
by Ward, an interception by
Brown, and a quarterback sack

by Rick Kulp, who now plays
defense only in goalline situa-
tions, thwarted each _ threat.

Meanwhile the Madison defense

held W&lL to only 382. third
quarter yards,
McHenry saw some bright

spots despite the final outcome.

“I’m very pleased with the im-
provement in our running game,”
MeHenry noted. W&L picked up
99 yards on the graund against
Madison, in contrast to the minus
26 yards rushing against Millers-
ville State. Junior running back
Rob Lindsey was the workhorse,
picking up 81 yards in 20 carries.

Again the passing game was
a bright spot, as Berry completed
23 of 39 aerials for 231 yards.
Mark George grabbed nine of
those for 103 yards, Tony Perry
added six catches for 64 yards,
and Cassell chipped in with five
catches for 43 yards and two
touchdowns.

McHenry credited defensive
linemen Warren Wolfe and John
Markley, linebacker Rob Muc-
ciola, and cornerback Brown for
their defensive play, but called
the overall defensive effort “in-
consistant.”

OUTLOOK and REVIEW

More to be pitied
than censured

The Executive Committee is at it again, It is beginning
its year on the wrong foot, Last week its members spent
hours working over the budgeting of student body funds and
in their desire to please everyone made some people slightly
unhappy.

Before commenting on the EC's budget here is a recount-
ing of the allottments it voted for the current academic year:

(Committee, allottment, amount requested, amount received

last year)

Ariel, $500, $1400.

Calyx, $7300, $8071.62, $7480.

Ring-tum Phi, $3900, $4250, $4000.

Contact, $4800, $5200, $4800.

Student Activities Board, $22,820, $24,000, (not funded from
student tax).

Student Bar Association, $3400, $3430, $3200.

Executive Committee, $1600, $2000, $1100.

Student Body Reserve Fund, $500, $2700, $3240.

Expense of Fund, $500, $500, $500.

Mock Convention, $2000, $2550, none.

Curriculum, $250, $380.50.

Rowing Club, $100.

The Student Recruitment Committee and the Outing Club
were denied an allottment.,

Recruitment Committee was not voted an
that its funds would come from
school, The Outing Club collects
group rather than the university
as a whole and therefore was not given any money. An
additional factor here was that the Outing Club did not ask

The Student
allottment on the premise
another source within the
dues and serves a limited

lor a specific appropriation, and one can hardly ask for a
handout unless one offers a definite proposal of some sort.

Of course, no one wants to have his budget cut to any
extent, Nevertheless the EC did its best to please all the
protagonists of this domestic melodrama called “budget hear-
ings.”

Unfortunately the EC bent over backwards. To begin
with, EC members showed supreme self-sacrifice when they
trimmed down their own budget to within $500 of the amount
they spent last year, They spent hours and hours of grueling
labor on everyone else's budget and in the end voted a big
cut in their own funds, This hardly seems just.

The publications can make it one way or the other and
could even take some money out of their reserve fund, All
the others can reorganize their budgets around the fairly

minimal cuts that were made.

We applaud the EC
to the Student Activities Board. They are obviously looking

members for giving so much money

out for their children and trying to see that we have a good
time. We only hope that they have not forced themselves
into a position where they cannot afford to have fun them-
selves,

lf any group in this school deserves a reward for its

labors it is the EC. We hope they will have enough money
to have one hell of a good banquet this year, If they spent
$250 on this fete last vear they should add about 100 per cent
inflation to that and have a party that wil Imake Olimpia
\ldebrandini and David de Rothchild green with envy,

\ few suggestions could be made for the 1974-75 EC gala.
We suggest that it rent the Arlington House, one of General
Lee's residences, and have an eight course formal dinner
served on the Reeves Collection of Chinese export porcelain.
Phe dinner should include truffles flown over from Paris and

salmon brought from Nova Seotia, Other nice additions

would include quantities of lranian caviar and a goodly

e
supply of Chateau Lafitte-Rothehild '57-—-we can hardly ex

pect our student government to imbibe some domestic wine,

It is acceptable (just barely) for the EC to show such

remarkable justice and their allocation of funds;

we only ask that it make certain that they receive their
own reward before the great hereatter.

Cheerleaders to lend support

BY TRAVELER

The athletic department bas at
last found a way to boost the
morale of both the football team
and the fans to provide eight
Mary Baldwin girls for our en-
tertainment, That is to say, W&L
will once again have cheerleaders,
starting this weekend with the
homecoming game against Ran-
dolph-Macon of Ashland (not
Lynchburg).

Coach Bill McHenry has felt
the need for W&L to have cheer-
leaders to lead the fans in their
revelries for the last few years.
This year Jack Berry, co-captain
of the team, was able to effect
this step.

Jack enlisted the ald of a friend
at Mary Baldwin, Eleanor “Chad”
Gubbins, to start recruiting girls
for the positions, In as little as
three days she organized the
undertaking with the help of
Baldwin's physical education de-
partment and held auditions.

A grand total of twenty girls
came to the auditions and dis-
played their prowess. Rumor has

Student shot
by a friend
for a lark

Last weekend a Pika took a
shot at a SAE and hit his target.
Apparently tribal warfare is rear-
ing its ugiv head on campus.

Billy Craver, a Pika sophomore,
mistook a 62" SAE for a dove,
he says. In Mr. Craver's
hunting party were a Sigma Nu
sophomore J. Lee Keiger and
freshman Burt Bartlett.

The unfortunate SAE, to whom
we may not refer by name, was
shot in the back (those Pikas
wild men). The buek shot
was then removed from his back
by the efforts of the men from
various fraternities in a united
action of which the  Inter-fra-
ternity Council] would be proud.

As a result of the unfortunate
occurance the gentleman from
SAE suffered the loss of a $250

had only recently purchased from

A Burmese contortionist was among those who auditioned for a position

for the past week and should be
ready to roll by the 12th of
December.

In the not so distant past W&L
was graced by the presence of
cheerleaders from Southern Semi-
nary. Who can say whether this

latest renewal of the practice
shows that we have taken one
step forward or two steps back-
wards? At any rate, the idea of
having cheerleaders in itself is
pleasant and nostalgic, so let’s
give it a chance.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR »

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

The new tennis coach at the
University, Mr. Dennis Bussard,
deserves great accolades for his
ingenuity in initiating the first
W&L Tennis Classic. Efficiently
run over this past weekend and
hanwpered only by the inevitable
rain, the Tennis Classic proved
to be a success for both players
and spectators alike. The tourna-
ment not only provided partici-
pants with challenging competi-
tion, but gave them the oppor-
tunity to meet other tennis buffs
whose acquaintances might other-
wise never have been made, The
standard of play made viewing
well worthwhile.

If the winners of the Men's
Singles, Doubles, and Mixed could
gloat over the trophies they re-
ceived in the aftermath of their
victories, then the losers at least
had the satisfving consolation of
having spent a thoroughly en-
jovable weekend.

If this is the manner in which
Mr. Bussard is going to tackle all
of his duties as Washington and
tennis czar, then our uni-
versity appears fortunate indeed
to have him in our employ.

Sincerely,
Tom Sansonetti

Ask Traveller

TRAVELLER—Where are the women at this place?
(Signed) Hermie
DIEAR HERM—tI take it that as vou read the catalog in applying to

Washington and Lee you mistook such “each year

Washington and Lee enrolls in its freshmen class about 360 men.”

The “men” referred to are male men, and not female men. Under-

stand? This may be tough to break to you, but W&L does not

accept such lowly members of the human race as females, At
least the undergraduate schoo! doesn’t. The law schoo! has been

a bit more farsighted and does admit women, and the higher up

of the law school said the decision in 1971 to admit women was

not influenced in the least by the fact that the school would have
national accreditation had it not allowed (all 12
so of them) to enter,

Apparently you are not the only one fooled by the subtlety of
the Washington and Lee catalog. Mach vear the university has
to send out scores of form postcards to women throughout the
country, telling them that they were amiss (or, in accordanee
with new university policy, ams.) in their beliefs that W&L did
not allow the majority of America to attend its institution,

This is certainly not to that Washington and
about as few females as Lexington has fun places to go, Quite the
contrary, There mentioned above, an ever-inereasing
number of females in the law school, And, of course, there are the
exchange students from other colleges, and, heavens knows, there

are, as

must be at least 20 of them roaming the campus. These two
populations of females already reduce the male-female ratio at
Wé&L to something like 50 to 1. What more could you ask for?

Cheer up. You're lucky this school has any females at all. Why,
the school's forefathers are rolling in their graves now anyway,
although observers are not certain if it's because of the women,
the blacks, or the fact that History of the South is not a required
course.

Actually, the behind Wé&L's all-male atmosphere is
simple. The university receives a large grant each vear from the
major oi! companies, The theory is that with no girls on campus,

reason

anybody who's anybody will be making road trips, thus using
gasoline, It's very simple—both the oi! companies and the uni
versity profit. There's only one loser in the whole deal. The

Strong defensive iplay  spear-
headed by fullback Barelay Arm-
strong and a_ productive game
from Washington Lee's’ front
line sparked the Generals to a
3-1 soccer victory over Eastern
Vennonite Saturday.

W&L never trailed in raising
their record to 1-0-1, as they took
a 1-0 lead early in the first half
on a penalty kick by Jim Fox.
The defense, led by Armstrong
and Gardner Britt, made the lead
stand up until early in the sec-
ond half, when Billy Cogar con-
verted a Chuck Alexander pass
into the second W&L goal.

Juan Yoder gave Eastern Men-
nonite its only goal with eight
minutes left to cut the W&L lead
to 2-1, But the Generals’ Jembe
Mwakalu scored late in the game
off a John Embree pass to clinch
the win.

Washington and Lee's 1974
cross country season gets under-
way Saturday when the harriers
host Roanoke, Christopher New
port, and Old Dominion in a
quadrangular meet over the new
country course. The meet
will begin at 11:30 a.m.

Cross

Head coach Dick Miller, while
not making any predictions about
the season, did say that he is
looking forward to the coming
year. Miller said that with eight
lettermen returning, including co-
captains Tem Washington and
Jim McMenamin, the possibili-
ties for a fine season are good,

itself has been
changed, with several sections
being eliminated in favor of
longer, more difficult stretches.
One runner said that it takes sev-
eral trial runs on the course be-
fore you can get used to all the
different terrains encountered,
including mud, steep hills, rocky
roads, and flat trails.

Miller said that defending

first half.

W&L looked lifeless in the opening thirty minutes, picking up only
one first down and 52 total offensive yards in the first two quarters,
while allowing their former College Athletic Conference foes 19 points
and over 200 total yards.

“We weren't ready to play when the game began,”
head coach Bill McHenry afterward. “We
until after halftime.”

Maybe it was something that was said in the locker room during
intermission that caused the excitement as the Generals converted
their first three offensive possessions of the second half into 21 points,
enabling them to grab a 21-19 lead.

just the Generals’ passing game in the

lamented W&L

That lead was shortlived, however, as the Colonels drove 61 yards
in 11 plays on the following series, with freshman halfback Mark
Davis scoring from five yards out to wrap the victory up for the
homestanding Colonels,

“We were enthused by our play in

bursts by running backs Mercer West and Rob Lindsey gave

offense saw the chains move in their favor until the second half.

The first quarter saw defense dominate until Centre started a
drive late in the period, The 78-yard march was capped at 11:34 in the
second quarter when halfback Greg Young scampered 28 yards off
jeft tackle for the opening touchdown. Jim Akin’s kick made it 7-0.

After W&L punted on the following series, the Colonels again
threatened, moving down to the W&L 5. But a fourth down attempt
was thwarted when freshman cornerback Charlie Brown came across
the field to break up a Roy Beard pass.

But again W&L failed to move the ball and was forced to punt.
This time the Colonels moved in, with Beard rolling around right
end for the final nine yards. Freshman Jeff Slatcoff blocked Akin's
PAT attempt, and it was 13-0 with 1:49 left in the half.

More to be paid
than censured

This year the student Executive Committee has already
started working long hours to insure that things rum as
smoothly as possible. If it is indisposed to the idea of giving
a party that will make everybody want to run for office, then
the least it can do is see to it that its members are in some
way recognized for their efforts. The student body as a whole
is usually rather unappreciative of the blessings bestowed
upon them by those who try to make Washington and Lee
a better place for us at which to relax.

Our student government is unique in comparison with the
student government associations at other schools, For better
or for worse, it is a very powerful group. Whereas many
institutions entertain (or suffer under) a form under which
a legislative body decides much of the policy and an executive
administers it, here the EC allocates funds, makes laws and
sees to it that they are enforced.

At W&L we have one ruling body in student government
which does everything necessary, and unnecessary, and the
University Council usually stands by watching it get things
done, Sometimes the EC does too much or is guilty of doing
the wrong thing, but at least it tries to do something.

We do not mean to imply that the EC is riding a mammoth
white horse and wearing a suit of Gorham sterling armour
as the champion of vital causes, In fact, we would all perhaps
be better off it it did less.

We only wish to acknowledge here their hard work and
the hours of pure drudgery they serve so that we are left
with as little as possible to think about that is of a serious
nature. Unfortunately they are not repaid for their efforts
in any significant way.

At other institutions in this area, those who put in fewer
hours than students leaders here are reimbursed for their
time and labor. For example, at Madison College the presi-
dent of the government association is granted a twenty-hour
work scholarship each month which amounts to about $32.
(ther officers there are also paid in like manner but on a
stialler seale, ic. ten-hour monthly work scholarships.

Hampden-Sydney is in many ways comparable to W&L
but there too the president of the student body receives a
salary. The president is given $520 a year; the secretary,
$175; and the judicial “person,” $250. At Roanoke College
the president of the student government makes $000 for his
year in office. The salaries at Lynchburg College make all
those mentioned look small: president-—$800; vice-president—
$000, secretary—$500, judicial person—$150.

At the various institutions mentioned thus far those who
spend a large part of their time working for the school are
recognized in some way and fairly handsomely in many cases.
We have already suggested that the EC repay its own efforts
by grossly indulging itself at the end of the year. However,
it appears that many elected officials are shy about such
highhanded and enjoyable fringe benefits as parties given for
themselves. This is regrettable, to say the least.

If the members of the EC feel that this form of reimburs-
ment in inappropriate then they should at the very least con-
sider paying themselves for a job overdone or underdone, as
the case may be. W&L can easily afford to pay them—after
all, they control a considerably larger budget than almost any
school here mentioned, It is about time for the students at
Washington and Lee to show them that we are willing to
give credit where credit is unquestionably due,

A new Wé&L?

After homecoming weekend no one could possibly accuse
W&k of being a conservative place. The acceptance by the
student body and campus authorities of Charlene Flowers
gives us the impression that this school is not so far removed
irom the more renowned centers of sin and degradation,

Last Friday afternoon various fraternities and student
groups presented their candidates for homecoming queen
before a panel of judges in duPont Auditorium, Among the
contestants was someone from the Beta house, one Charlene
Flowers, As it became readily apparent, she was a he.

The judges (Betty Munger, Lad Sessions, Bob NWeele and
|. D. Futeh) were practically rolling on the floor in gales of
laughter, At one point a judge asked him/her if he would
accept the possibility of being kissed by Dr, Shillington,
With a maidenly blush Charlene replied, “Il take my perver-
sion any way | can get it.”

but the worst was yet to come, Charlene and his Beta
date made a grand entrance imto the cocktail party at the
\lumni House. As if that was not brazen enough Charlene
added to the excitment of the party by approaching Presi-
dent Huntley and kissing him while alumni and faculty

watched,

In 1874 it could not have happened. Fifty years ago such
a person would have been dismissed, As little as ten years
ago it would have at least blown some people out, Last week-
end it caused about a ten second stir on campus and was
promptly ignored, It seems that W&L now bears a resembl-
ance to the debauched Germany of the early thirties: the
more perverse the occurance, the less unexpected it is.

Kd, note: The following article
was submitted by two students
who express their sentiments
to the entire community of
Washington and Lee—students,
faculty and staff. We run their
statement because we believe it
to be a_ reasonable, coherent
and valid point of view which
should be of concern to the
school,

By CLAY JACKSON
and DAVID PITTMAN

The purpose of this article is
to express personal thoughts and
feelings regarding the use of
Lee Chapel. The University com-
munity should be aware of Robert
Ki. Lee's intention when he estab-
lished a chapel at Washington
and Lee. However, in order to
fully appreciate Lee Chapel one
must be acquainted with the
man.

Kach member of the Washing-
ton and Lee community is surely
cognizant of General Lee’s con-
tribution to the school. His liberal
ideas concerning the expansion
of the curriculum, and his un-
limited and unselfish devotion of
time, effort and money are still
known today. From his ideas con-
cerning academies and the “ren-
aissance man” our present liberal
arts education evolved.

Lee firmly believed in the de-
velopment of all phases of the
individual—mental, physical and
spiritual. General Lee's emphasis
on a more flexible curriculum
served as a foundation to stimu-
late the students’ mental faculties.
Likewise, Lee Chapel was estab-
lished to meet the spiritual needs
of both the individual and the
community. The importance of
the Chapel to General Lee is re-
flected not only in its physical
location on campus but also by
its simplistic beauty.

Once the Chapel was completed
worship services were conducted
daily. The unheralded fact that

General Lee never missed a ser-
vice is historical testimony to his
faithfulness and deep-rooted be-
liefs,

What has the University done
for the memory of so great a
man? Services have been discon-
tinued totally, and the Chapel
has been converted into a mu-
seum and family mausoleum, The
present employment of Lee
Chapel as merely an auditorium
appears to us an insult to Gen-
eral Lee who, as President of
Washington College, expected the
Chapel to be used for worship
services, not as a personal me-
morial.

On the use of Lee Chapel

R. E. Lee Episcopal Church is,
of course, easily accessible,
but R. E. Lee Church is not Lee
Chapel. What kind of respect is
demonstrated to General Lee
when one of his most valued
achievements is either ignored or
misused after his death?

October 2, 1974, was the 109th
anniversary of Robert E. Lee’s
inauguration as President of
what is now Washington and Lee
University. No bells were sound-
ed; no notice was given to com-
memorate the simple ceremony
conducted in Payne Hall in 1865.
The name which the University
now bears memorializes two of

the finest and most prominent
men in American history. Is the
Washington and Lee community
unaware of the heritage and his-
tory behind the University or has
that history just been forgotten?

We suggest that a weekly ser-
vice conducted by the chaplain of
the University be instituted and
held each Sunday. Ideally the
service should remain non-de-
nominational as General Lee pro-
posed. This would provide the stu-
dents, faculty and administration
a convenient place to worship,
and, of equal importance, due re-
spect would be paid to General
Lee and his wishes.

Arthur Silver: a living legend

By BRECK INGLES

Lexington is a town blessed
with more than its share of eld-
erly people, people who add much
color, personality, and a sense
of timelessness to a place with
a large transitory population. One
such person is Arthur Silver, a
man who settled down from the
exciting life of Vaudeville to the
quiet life of Lexington.

The name “Arthur Silver” has
greatly varied connotations to
different people, for Arthur is a
man of many talents. For those
who have his Vaudeville side, he
is known for his amazing vocal
talents, which have earned him
the nick-name of “the voice,” and
he is known for his knee-slapping
jokes, For those who merely come
off the street to get a bargain of
a deal at the “sale” sign, Arthur
offers the latest—and by this I
mean about twenty years late—
styles,

If age is to be equated with
wisdom, Arthur at the age of
eighty-five should be able to im-
part much good advice to the
willing listener. He says that the
day of the small businessman is
gone, that people are too hurried

Student, Mel share cell-
exchange views on life

By TRAVELER

W&L students have always been
ingenious in finding interesting
ways to spend weekends. No ex-
ception is a student known to
many as Tube King who spent
homecoming with Mel Greenberg
in the Rockbridge County jail.

The King was arrested Satur-
day night by the police for being
dvunk and disorderly in public—
in other words, it was just
another Saturday night like so
many others, At the time of his
capture the King was accompani-
ed by his date and an alumnus
who is now a magistrate in North
Carolina, The magistrate-alumnus
came to King’s defense and suc-
cessfully provoked the policeman
into taking King back to the
tank.

In the spacious quarters of the
Rockbridge jail King was given
the opportunity to share a ceil
with the ijlustrious Mel Green-
berg or Donkey Woman. Tube
chose to take up residence briefly
with Mel who occupied the bot-

tom bunk while Tube took the
lop.
The fraternal atmosphere of

the tank made an instantaneous,
intimate relationship between the
two a foregone conclusion. With-
in minutes they were discussing
the problems of being a derelict
in Lexington.

We discussed this holiday in
the clink with the Tube King
who found the accomodations to
be some of the best in the city.
The staff was friendly and graci-
ous throughout his short sojourn
there.

The most interesting fixture in
the facility was Mel. The King
describes Mel's appearance as
that of a classic Greek. Mel was
pleased to have a roommate from
the university community and
said that he had been getting
tired of the same old faces.

Mel's attitude was good and
he seemed to be enjoying three
free meals a day and the read-
ing materials provided by Rock-
bridge County. His suite—while
not the Lee—was nevertheless
suitable and he was fairly con-
tent. Mel did admit that by re-
peating his film caper in Ohio
he might not have used the best
possible judgement, to put it
mildly.

and tense today. Perhaps his
greatest insight was revealed
when he said that inflation is
only an invention of the restau-
rants in Lexington that permit
them to realize increasingly large
profit.

Arthur creates a great deal of
the sense of timelessness he
gives to his jokes, which one
suspects are as old as Arthur
himself:

“Did | tell you the one about
the man who came in and said
his sister-in-law was an angel to
which I replied that unfortunately
mine was still living.”

“The other day I went to Adair-
Hutton wanting some sundries
and notions, but when I went
up to the saleswoman I forgot
to ask her for the sundries and
said do you have any notions.
She allowed that she did, but
that she didn’t get off until five.”

And of course everyone has
heard Arthur's joke about the
woman with the peanut butter
legs.

As one enters Arthur's smal!
shop, he is amazed by an array
of bargains, especially in a time
of rising prices. Arthur gets
away with this through his own
very shrewd business sense. In-
stead of rushing out to the whole-
saler to buy the new fashions
Arthur merely holds onto this
old stock until it comes back into
style. By then the clothes have
the comfortable look, as though
they have been worn, or more
likely, as though they have pro-
vided a home for under-privileg-
ed moths.

Poor taste

We received a communication
last week which was somewhat
out of the ordinary. A student left
a copy of The Ring-tum Phi in
our office on which he had
circled the front page picture of
the pigs. Beside this he had in-
scribed, “POOR TASTE! The
humor in the rest of the paper
is a bit incipid [sic] also.” If you
thought that was in poor taste
you should have seen the date
| had last weekend.

Ask Travelle

If you need a slightly out of
the ordinary, dynamite wardrobe,
or if you want to compliment the
one you already have Arthur is
the man to go to. Or if you
would ever like to converse with
a man of so many insights and
such shrewdity Author will be
glad to entertain you.

LETTERS 10 THE EDITOR

Pika fires back

Kditor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I wish to complain of several
libelous statements and egregious
inaccuracies found in the article,
“Student shot by a friend for
a lark” (Ring-tum Phi, Thursday,
October 3). Obviously, the article
Was written tongue-in-cheek, but
the facts of the matter should
be presented in fairness to those
involved in the mishap. Billy
Craver never said he “mistook a
6'2" SAE for a dove,” and when
I read such an untrue assertion,
I wonder why on earth I ever
mistook the Ring-tum Phi for a
newspaper.

Craver did not “take a shot at
a SAE;” he took a shot at a
mourning dove. Unfortunately,
his friend Kim Ratliff (to whom
I may refer by name) sat some
thirty yards away, heavily cam-
ouflaged, virtually unpreceivable,
with his back directly in the line
of fire. The pellets were squeezed
from his back seley by Mr.
Craver, not by “a united action
of which the IFC would be
proud”, Fortunately, Ratliff was
not injured seriously. He and
Craver remain good friends and
were seen “juking” together at
Pika house Saturday night.

Both gentleman, as well as sev-
eral of the “wild men” from Pika
have expressed their extreme dis-
pleasure to me concerning this
absurd article, so I pass it on to
you. Perhaps you should have
checked out the facts with the
person who fired the shot before
you fired yours.

Sincerely,
Alfred B. Bettis,
President, Pi Chapter

other safe places on this side of the Mississippi include a bem)
shelter in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, the Antioch Revivalist
Hallelujah Chureh in Biloxi, Mississippi, and men’s room 43 at
the Pentagon, It's obvious what Lexington has in common with
these other places,

How was the safeness of Lexington determined, you may ask,
| may answer that Lexington was judged safe after 47 horny
virgins were strapped to telephone poles around the city for
two weeks in March, 1973, and not one was violated. In fact, not
one was noticed: Lexington is that safe, Anyway, the 47 now
work as ghost writers for Xariera Hollander, after leaving Lex-
ington for less safe places,

Ah, but it was not only the experiment with these women that
determined Lexington’s place among the elite few. Other factors
included Lexington's ability to combine the old with the new,
as testified by the age-old pink Presbyterian Church, adorned in
modern style with stained-glass frisbees, or the quaint old streets
with thelr modern traffie jams.

What else makes Lexington the safe city it is? Murder is un-
heard of—the local coroner doubles as a soda jerk at the Quid.
Robbery is also unknown—there'’s nothing in the city worth steal-
ing. Indeed, there are few crimes for which Lexington would be
a haven, although the socloeconomic status of the area seems
to qualify it as a potential breeding ground for welfare cheat-
ing, if only the government would explain to the city what wel-
fare is.

Looking back in local police files, the last unnatural death
recorded in Lexington occurred when the driver of a car hit his
head on a telephone pole while turning a corner and died instantly.
Why a driver would come so close to a telephone pole as to hit
his head was net determined hy police. Date of the death was
Mareh, 1973, That date rings a bell for some reason ,

So

With receivers Mark George (87) and Tony Perry (8) removed from the play by Randolph-Macon cov-
crage, W&L quarterback Jack Berry puts the football under his arm and heads upfield. Berry and
the W&L offense had another good day Saturday, but the unusual play at the end of the Homecoming
game cost the Generals their first 1974 win, and forced them instead to settle for a 20-20 tie.

SOCCER

Jim Fox's goal with 13 minutes
left enabled Washington and Lee’s
soccer team to salvage a 2-2 tie
with Randolph-Macon Friday.

The Generals bolted to a 1-0
lead with just seconds gone when
Bob Crawford scored following
an error by R-M goalie Ralph
Vaughn. The Yellow Jackets’ Phil
Bourdreau then score twice in
the opening half to give R-M a
2-1 lead at intermission.

The W&L defense, led by goalie
Paul Devine, who made 15 saves,
held R-M at bay throughout the
second half. Then Fox got the

tying goal off a rebound.

W&L’s record now stands at
10-2. The Generals host state
champion Madison Sunday after-

Homecomings, with their parties
and reunions, can often bring out
the zaniest in people.

At Washington and Lee Satur-
day the annual alumni reunion
went one step further—along
with all the fun came a_ wild,
wacky, and at times unbelievable
football game,

Consider the following events
if you need proof:

—Randolph-Macon failed to
convert any extra points, while
W&L got some help from above
when a Ralph Moore PAT at-
tempt hit the upright and bounc-
ed through.

—The Yellow Jackets commit-
ted more penalties than did the
Generals, turned the ball over six
times against W&L’s one mistake,
and yet still piled up more total
offensive yards than did the
homestanders (343 to 263),

—Fans again left what was a
tight ball game with several
minutes left to enjoy other en-
tertainment which could not have
been as good or as exciting as
the closing seconds of the game.

It Was as zany as it could have
been, Unfortunately for W&L, the
last play from scrimmage was
the zaniest, and it cost the Gen-
erals their first 1974 win.

With :13 left, Randolph-Macon’‘s
Jay Tingle fired a desperation
pass toward the end zone. W&L
freshman cornerback Charlie
Brown backpedaled and picked off
the pass. It looked like a 20-18
win.

Brown's momentum — carried
him into the end zone, where he
continued running with the ball
in an attempt to kill the clock.
Then, in a mass of confusion, he
dropped to one knee to down the
ball for a touchback. However,
the officials ruled it was Brown's
own impetus, not momentum,
that got him into the end zone.
Instead of a touchback, the signal
was for a safety, and the one that
would have gone into the win
column went to the other side
of the record listings as a 20-20
tie,

The safety dulled what head
coach Bill McHenry termed “the
best 60 minutes of football we’ve
played this year.” Though the
Generals were outplayed as far
as the statistics show, it was
obvious throughout the game that
it was W&L who was taking the
play to their opponents.

The W&L offense threatened on
their first possession as they
drove to the Yellow Jacket 13,
but a 30-yard field goal attempt
by Moore went wide, Only a few
minutes later, after freshman
Mike Airheart recovered a R-M
fumble on the visitors’ 15, the
Generals moved in with Rob
Lindsey diving over from the one.
Moore’s kick made it 7-0, with
1:33 left in the first period.

The W&L defense sitiffened on
the following series, forcing the
Yellow Jackets to punt. Then
W&L moved 80 yards in six plays
—including a 26-yard burst by
Lindsey, and passes from Jack
Berry to Tony Perry for 10 yards,
to Eamon Cassell for 18, and to
Mark George for 26 and six
points on the second play of
the second quarter. Moore’s kick
then hit the upright, got the
membership bounce, and it was
14-0,

Wé&L got a golden opportunity
just two plays later, when Louis
McFadden, who had two _ pass
thefts later, recovered a Budgy
Campbell fumble at the R-M 18,
But another field goal attempt
by Moore, this one from 34 yards
out, failed.

The Yellow Jackets then got on
the seoreboard late in the first
half. With Jeff Hutchinson, a bet-
ter runner than starting quarter-
back Tingle inserted, Randolph-
Macon exploited the Generals’ de-
fense with the option play, where
they found great success. With
1:08 left in the half, Tim Rzep-
kowski, last year’s most valuable
player in the Virginia Collegiate
Athletic Conference, went in from
three yards out. Bruce Fleegal’s
kick went wide, leaving W&L
with a 14-6 halftime lead.

The Yellow Jackets maintained
their momentum in the third

quarter, After stopping W&L fol-
lowing the second half kickoff,
R-M moved 55 yards in 13 plays,
with Rzepkowski going in from
the one. A Hutchinson pass for a
two-point conversion missed its
target, and the Generals’ lead was
cut to 14-12,

Then two plays later a strong
Yellow Jacket rush forced Berry
to throw the ball up for grabs.
Ileegal moved up from the sec-
ondary to intercept the pass and
give R-M a chance to go ahead.
But eight plays later Jeff Opp
returned the favor for W&L,
picking off a Hutchinson pass at
the Generals 10 to stop the threat,

Both defenses stiffened until
midway in the final period, when
R-M given good field position
by a Hutchinson punt return,
moved 42 yards in 7 plays, with
Rzepkowski again scoring, this
time from seven yards out.
Another pass for a_ two-pointer
failed, and the Yellow Jackets
took their only lead of the day
at 18-14,

That’s when a good part of the
Wilson Field crowd of 5,000 head-
ed for the bridge which proved
to be a big mistake. Brown re-
turned the kick to the 36, and
the W&L offense went to work.
A 14-yard gallop by Mercer West
gave the Generals a first down
at midfield. Then Berry scrambl-
ed for 19 yards to the R-M 31.
A Berry-toCassell pass set W&L
up at the 5, and two plays later,
Berry arched a four yard scor-
ing strike to Perry, who made
a sensational catch while stretch-
ed out in mid-air. But Moore's
kick was blocked, giving the Gen-
erals a 20-18 lead.

Randolph-Macon got the ball
and picked up a first down, but
then was forced to punt. Then
the Yellow Jackets stopped a
W&L attempt to run out the clock,
forcing a punt with 1:03 left.

Two passes by Tingle moved
the ball from the R-M 40 to the
Generals 41. An incompletion left
13 on the clock, and then came
the pass which changed the final
outcome of a zany, crazy 60
minutes of football.

“Nonetheless, the thing I hoped
would stick in their minds,”
Bailey stated, “was the emphasis

Exorcism is not unknown
to local Episcopal priest

By JOE FITZGERALD
Phi Staff Reporter

Although it may come as a
shock to many fans of William
Peter Blatty and of his creations,
exorcists and cases of possession
ave exceedingly rare, and the
overblown attention paid to such

cases is due largely to the ap-
pearance of the novel The
Exorcist, and the subsequent
nvovie.

According to Rev. D. Holmes
ving Jr. reotor of the Robert
fe. Lee Memorial Episcopal
Ohurch, the mania is “part of
the whole area of interest in

the supernatural” that exists to-
day, and is caused by a “craving
for some contact with the super-
natural.”

Rev. Irving has performed an

exorcism himself, and describes
his own experience with the rite
as “very emotional but

nothing dramatic.”

Rev. Irving's performance came
two Year's in Charlottesville
at the altar of an Episcopal
church after the request of a
pyehiatrist and the mother of the
14 year old patient. The Rev-
erend knelt at the altar and
prayed that the evil spirit in the
teenager's body be replaced by
the Spirit of God. He recounts
no fiying furniture or any of
the other strange occurrences
depicted in the William Friedkin
movie.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK,

Rush

Now that the endurance contest is over, which is to say
that rush ended last week, we feel at liberty to make a few
observations and comments on the nature of this year’s rush.

The Interfraternity Council oversees a rush which is fairly
formal in structure, Freshmen sign up to go to individual
fraternities at appointed times and are invited back if the
fraternity wants to see more of them, if the members of a
given fraternity have the presence of mind to remember this
formality. An alternative would be for the IFC to direct an
“open” rush which would be less structured and probably
less effective.

 

The system as it now stands forces the freshmen to see
many different houses on an equal footing. It does not leave
to the novice the responsibility of gleaning a fairly accurate
idea of what various fraternities are like. This somewhat
formal structure takes the initiative away from the freshman,
which is probably a good thing. Most freshmen would not
take it upon themselves to visit many fraternities or find
out what the system is all about in an “open” rush situation.

The IFC does its level best to insure that rush is as equit-
able for all fraternities as possible and in this it succeeds in
large part. Perhaps it even does too much, Many fraternities
and freshmen felt that this year’s rush was too long. By the
fourth week of rush many were ready to call it a day
and had felt that way for almost a week. This is shown by
the fact that the IFC bowed to peer pressure and relaxed
its regulations towards the end, However fraternities were
still required to honor the right of the freshman to visit the
house on the scheduled rush date.

By the time rush ended this year people had already
begun to face tests and to feel the crunch academically.
Kither someone is going to have to ask for the faculty’s mercy
throughout September or rush needs to be shortened. In this
rather uneven contest it would be advisable for the IFC to
shorten rush.

We would also suggest that domitory rush either be
opened up or dispensed with altogether. As it now stands
fraternity men are allowed in the dorms only once in a blue
moon and the wily freshman can usually evade their in-
vaders. The houses should either be given a fair chance of
seeing the freshmen in the dorms or refused entrance com-
pletely.

One of the worst problems, or at least one of the most
persistent, is dirty rush, Over the years, with no restraint,
some houses have developed rather elaborate systems and
techniques of hurling diatribes at other houses, This year a
rush official was assigned to each house to see that such
infractions were not allowed, This gentleman was often
given a tour of the bathroom facilities or the boiler room so
that he could not interfere with a fraternity’s technique.

Once again dirty rush was utilized by many houses
which succeeded in exhibiting the pettiness of those who en-
gaged in the practice. Something should be done to force
W&L gentlemen to start acting like gentlemen in this respect.

Although there is a great deal that might be changed
about rush to make it more tolerable and enjoyable for all
those involved it is basically a good system. It allows those
who participate to become acquainted with many groups of
people on campus who would probably remain unknown and
unappreciated without such a formal structure,

The IFC has established a rush committee headed by
vice-president Darrell LaPrade to investigate possible re-
forms to the rush procedure, Of course “reform” implies ma-
jor overhaul which is inappropriate, but there a few matters
which could be slightly changed to make rush more profit-
able, We only venture to hope that if change is affected it
will be kept to a minimum and enhance the value of rush
rather than make it ineffective.

By BARNEY SKELTON

Entertainment Editor

I have listened for four years
now to W&L students making the
most scurrilous of remarks
about this lovely little town nestl-
ed in the fold of the Shenandoah
Valley, and | think it is time
to come to its defense. So, as
entertainment editor of this rag
I intend to leap into the fray,
and strike down that wildly in-
accurate assertion that “‘there is
nothing to do in Lexington.” Now
1 am not talking about anything
the University offers, ie. con-
certs, plays, dances, ete., rather
I am refering only to the myriad
of attractions which the city and
the surrounding area itself pro-
vides.

Of course, the most obvious ex-
amples to turn to, are those
bastions of cinematic grandeur,
“The Lyric” (or “The Pit’), and
“The State” theatres. Why only
last year “The Lyric” held Lex-
ington’s premier showing of Gone
With the Wind. Unfortunately,
for reasons beyond his control,
Clarke Gable declined to attend.
However, the show was held over
for an unprecedented week and
two days, and only then was it
ceased due to Wé&L students
protesting the fact that it was
holding up a Kung Fu triple fea-
ture.

A seasonal feature is the high-
ly touted annual Moose Carnival,
held in the spring. Besides the
ferris wheel, pony rides and

clowns (these are always a hit
with the W&L crowd) there is
an excellent Follies Bergere Re-
vue. The reason, I suppose that so
many W&L men attend this re-
vue is that the dancers all exude
that “girl next door” look, be she
from 42nd street, “the Block,” or
LaGrange, Texas.

However, it is not just the
major attractions which Lexing-
ton offers that I intend to ad-
dress. The events I enjoy, and find
entertaining are often little
things. For instance, I’ve always

exington-it does require
a good sense of humor

found it amusing to watch that
lovable town drunk, and (as he
steadfastly maintains) former
Harlem Globetrotter, Mr. Skinny
Doc, making his way down Main
Street. As if by the benevolence
of the City Fathers, there seem
to be just enough parking meters
available for him to hold on to
so that he can make it all the
way without a fall, Another under-
rated item is the sizzling show
which that sexy scooper at High’s
Ice Cream Parlour puts on. I’ve
sometimes sat there for five or

six cones, but, then again I’ve
always been a sucker for “bee-
hive” hairdo’s.

Alas, as space does not permit
me I must cease my address
here, leaving numerous people,
places, and events unrecognized.
However, if | may interject a
parthian shot, I will always main-
tain that the only requisite for
enjoying your stay in Lexington
is a good sense of humor. If you
do not have that, it is unlikely
you will be happy anywhere else,
either,

What does the IFC do?

By SADINOEL

Most of the students on this
campus are largely unaware of
what the Interfraternity Council
really does. Freshmen are only
exposed to this body during rush
and thus are given the impres-
sion that everything the IFC does
is somehow restrictive to the fra-
ternities.

It is bad enough that freshmen
think of the IFC as the body
responsible for not allowing them
to drink anything but cokes at
open houses, What is worse is
that the conception of the IFC
held by most wpperclassmen is
almost as narrow. This is to
imply that the IFC is doing more
than most students are aware of
and that it is not fully recognized

for its constribution to the school.

The Interfraternity Council
really does do a great deal to
promote the best interests of the
fraternities which represent about
two-thirds of the student body.
In addition it sponsors and co-
sponsors many activities on cam-
pus which add to the general
betterment of Washington and
Lee.

The largest monetary contribu-
tion the IFC makes is to Contact.
Last year it granted the Contact
Committee a total of $3000. This
was a gift given with no stimpla-
tions as to its use. In fact the
IFC has nothing to say about
the choice of Contact speakers
and was rarely kept up with de-
velopments in the Contact pro-
gram last year. Needless to say,

Stafford Wing: a singing parable

By PHILLIP ENRICO, Jr.

Last Thursday night at 8:00 in
Lee Chapel, the community
around W&L was offered a pleas-
ant diversion as the Concert Guild
inaugurated its annual program
with a concert featuring Stafford
Wing, a tenor soloist. He was ac-
companied on the piano as he
sang in German, English, French,
and Italian for an hour without
any written notes or prompting
of any kind. Yet, it was not only
his professionalism which im-
pressed everyone.

Mr. Wing is symbolic of true
greatness in mankind. He mea-
sures up to the formerly chaste
definition of artist which meant
absolute devotion to an ideal
greater than oneself, One can ad-
mire the man who trains him-
self many hours just to grasp a
level of perfection which cannot
be sustained longer than a single
hour in spare, little Lee Chapel.

Letters
To the Editor

Party

Through the centuries that
Washington and Lee University
has been in existence many leg-
ends and myths have grown and
been spread concerning the men
of old W&L. In distant parts of
the country many speak of the
beautiful school in Lexington
with the long standing tradition
of “aeademic excellence and wild
parties,” and the perpetuators of
that tradition have been called
a unique breed,

When | personally was honored
with Dean Farrar’s invitation to
Lexington, | looked forward to
being part of this rich heritage.
In my vears at W&L I have found
that while the academics are even
tougher than one would have ex-
pected, one might be slightly dis-
appointed with the social life in
light of the stories concerning
past years. The “W&éL gentile-
man” no longer seems to live
up to the traditional ideal of
work and roadtrips five nights
a week and nothing but wild
partying the entire weekend.
There's too much work being
done in too much time. As a re-
sult there has been a minimum
of hard core partying done as
of iale.

Now it just so happens that
an excellent opportunity ia com-
ing up when we can put aside
our books and give new life to
the W&L party tradition. You
some idiot decided to have

(Contmued on page 4)

aoe,

That was what Mr. Wing ac-
complished last Thursday. It was
refreshing just to reflect on the
devotion of the man. When one
considers the dilettantes who
make up too many of the stu-
dents of this college, one feels a
dull, sick pain in the depths of
the heart which is too deep for
tears. Their aimless lives, con-
sumed in gross excesses, stand in
sharp contrast to the dedication
ef this tenor. For those who feel
that life is too short to waste on
drunken dissipation, dishonorable
sluts, and similar decrement of
humanity, Mr. Wing represents
the viable hope that there is a
worthy goal to achieve in life.
Like Wittgenstein, he exempli-
fies the man whose consecration
demands heart, mind, soul, and
strength in service to his ideal.

The translations provided were
helpful because they showed the
audience that the performer felt
what he sang.

Among the German pieces, for
example, Mr. Wing sang with
reverence “Schlafendes Jesukind,”
which deseribed the Lord Jesus
as a child with His mother. The
same reverence was heard as he
sang “Auf ein altes Bild,” stir-
ring even to the unbelieving, in
whieh the boy Jesus played in a
meadow, while not far off was
maturing the tree whose wood
would serve for His cross.

Perhaps the most poignant
song of the concert was “Ver-
borgenheit.” In its appeal for
solitude as a balm for insecrut-
able inward longings, the im-
perative “Leave me to myself,
O world!” awakes understandabie
sympathy In the modern listener.

Competition

makes dating

difficult

Next week the conrpetition for
dates in the Valley should be a
bit more strenuous than usual.
The easy access that W&L men
have enjoved to the surrounding
girls schools seems to be on the
verge of disappearing.

This weekend is Parents’ Week-
end at Mary Baldwin College.
To make matters worse Hamp-
denSydney and Virginia are both
having big goinge<n. It sounds
like W&L gentlemen are going
to have to shape up their pro-
grams or face annihilation as a
potent force on nearby campuses.

In thie day and time it is no
longer possible for just runof-
the-mill fieh to eall a girls’ school

There were some delightful,
whimsical songs by Erik Satie
which Mr. Wing sang with such
roguishness that he provoked
laughter throughout Lee Chapel.
The great tenor had such a wry
expression on his face, what
could one do but laugh?

The concert ended with selec-
tions from Benjamin Britten's
“Sonnets of Michelangelo,” rather
dull in their operatic Italian; so,
it was perhaps an unfortunate
ending. Yet, when it was over
the audience was enthusiastic in
the applause it gave Mr, Wing.

As everyone left, there was a
cheery feeling of greatness in
General Lee’s chapel. One can-
not be so impious as to say that
Mr. Wing's performance was a
religious experience, but to a
society which in its folly has
rejected God, it was an experi-
ence as nearly divine as will ever
be felt by its citizens. For the
happy faithful, it was a further
manifestation of the truth in
Genesis 1:27.

the IFC has no representative on
the Contact Committee who could
solely represent its interests.
Various public service endeav-
ors also receive the support of
the Interfraternity Council. Last
year it endorsed the Hunger Walk
and urged the fraternities to
participate in and support this
cause. For the United Fund Drive
and the Blood Drive the IFC en-
couraged the houses to cooperate
by promising a keg to the fra-
ternities offering the greatest sup-
port for each of these projects.

The Interfraternity Council is
made up of representatives from
the social fraternities on campus
and thus contributes to the social
life here to a considerable degree.
For Fancy Dress last year the
Student Activities Board was able
to work through the IFC to in-
sure itself of selling enough
tickets to make the weekend pos-
sible. When the SAB failed to
offer the campus any entertain-
ment for last Spring Weekend the
IFC took up the slack and spon-
sored a dance on Saturday night.
Later in the month the IFC
plans to sponsor a combo at the
Pavillion with swill for the gen-
eral gratification of fraternity
members,

The generosity of this group
finds outlets in many other mis-
cellaneous activities. Last year it
contributed $300 to send imem-
bers of the lacrosse team on an
international tour to play lacrosse
in Australia. In a different reaim,
it paid the room and board for
many foreign exchange students
who were housed in fraternities.

The fraternity system at Wash-
ington and Lee accomplishes
many things which benefit the
whole school and not just fra-
ternity members. Its public ser-
vice capacity is one aspect of
which many are unaware, but in
consideration of its accomplish-
ments it should not be taken for
granted,

Hampden-Sydney proved — to
Washington and Lee Saturday
that its reputation as a strong de-
fensive football team was more
than a rumor, as they completely
stymied the usually potent W&L
attack enroute to a 16-6 win in
the annual Jaycees charity game
in ‘Lynehburg.

Led by All-American defensive
end candidate Hd Kelley, who
spent as much time in the W&L
baofield as did the Generals’ run-
ning backs, the Tigers held W&L
to eight first downs and 184
total offensive yards for the game.
In the process they ran _ their
string of scoreless quarters to 16
before a NCAA record-tying 99-
yard scoring pass from Jack
Berry to fullback Mercer West
with 3:21 to play ended the shut-
out streak,

The H-S defense also accounted
for the Tigers’ lone touchdown,
as safety Holt Moran went 35
yards for a score with one of the
five interceptions Berry suffered

Rugby season
has a slow start

By the Phi Sports Staff

The Washington and Lee Rugby
Club remains scoreless after drop-
ping its first two games to
Lynchburg and Hampden-Sydney.

Playing in Lynchburg last
weekend before the Jaycee Bow]
football game, the Blues gave up
four tries to Hampden-Sydney,
losing 16-0,

When the Generals met Lynch-
burg on the Blues’ thhome turf
Sept. 28, the official scorer lost
count in the second half of the
match as the visiting team’s
score neared fifty.

 

WésL falls again
as H-S defense,
Kelley key 16-6 win

in the game.

Kicker George Simons provided
all of the Tigers’ offensive punch,
with field goals of 35, 23, and 35
yards in addition to the extra
point after Moran’s touchdown.

Meanwhile the W&L defense
gave its best showing of the year,
holding the H-4S offense at bay
throughout the game, Two of
Simons’ field goals were the total
offensive production for
night.

Further evidence of the de-
fensive domination of the game
were the 22 punts, eleven coming
from each team, Simons, despite
being credited with a four-yard
punt after
over his head, still averaged
39.5 yards a kick, while W&L
freshman George Makris aver-
aged 37 yards per punt,

The game was nothing like last
year’s matchup, which proved to
be a mismatch as H-S steamrolled
a then unbeaten Generals squad,
42-4, The 1973 contest was far
from the “bowl game” jabel the
Jaycees attach to the contest,
but this year’s affair was fitting
of any post-season tussel.

After a scoreless first quarter,
which saw neither team cross the
midfield stripe, HS got on the
scoreboard early in the second
period as Simons connected on a
35-yard field goal with 13:45 to
play.

W&L had a scoring opportun-
ity later in the quarter when Jon
Markley recovered a Jon Daly
fumble at the Tigers 22. The
threat was snuffed out when
Kelley spilled West for an eleven
yard loss on a sereen pass, and
on the next play, David Paxton
grabbed the first of the intercep-
tions.

It was after halftime when the
Tigers defensive unit took con-
trol of the game. On the second
play after the kickoff, a Berry

A football team needs support

By BILL FLESHER

For Washington and Lee's foot-
ball team, the first half of the
1974 football season now belongs
to the past.

To the ‘players, the mistakes,
frustrations, and outcomes of the
first five games are no more than
distant memories. The winless
streak admittedly has been a try-
ing experience for everyone in-
volved. Yet depsite it all the
team morale is higher than it
has been in years, and the sens-
ing of a victory in the not-at-all-
distant future is a real one.

The team members will forget
these five discouraging weeks.
But I can't file them away with-
out some words—few of them
complimentary—about the atti-
tudes of you, the self-proclaimed,
so-called “fans” of the Generals.

With the exception of the
months which see Wilson Field
as the home of a lacrosse team

which has enjoyed immense suc-
and, admittedly, fine fan
support in recent years, the ma-
jority of the university com-
munity shares a rotten attitude
toward some of their best friends
who make up the athletic squads
at W&L,

There are those individuals—
who constitute a definite minor-
ity—who deserve more than com-
pliments for their continued sup-
port of athletics at W&L. Not
enough can be said for them.

Yet the majority is a case for
analysis. Football games are for
many a social event, a party
thrown by the Athletic Depart-
ment for the purpose of blowing
out a date, making a fool of
oneself, or a combination § of
both.

For others they're simply a
spacefiller on the Weekly
Calendar to be merely ignored in
favor of an afternoon surrounded-

cess

Weekly Football Contest

ed by a blaring stereo and a case
of National Bohs.

Others would drive up to 600
miles to see Alabama, Penn State,
Maryland, or the Redskins play.
Yet they wouldn't consider a 45-
minute drive to see W&lL play
in nearby Lynchburg, as was
evidenced by the slim crowd from
Lexington—largely made up of
those “minority memibers’’—on
Saturday night.

It's about time the people who
make W&L change their outlook
on football and athletics in gen-
eral. To support the hometown-
ers or homestaters is great—but
don’t you think that will some-
day become your alma mater de-
serves some support as well,

You do a hell of a job for the
lacrosse team, but why quit
there? It's time for that change,
as it is time for the football
team to get back on the track—
right now,

Madison’s nationally ranked
soccer team, held in check in
the first half by Washington and
Lee’s defense, exploded for three
goals in the first ten minutes of
the second half to earn a 3-2 win
Sunday in a Virginia Intercollegi-
ate Soccer Association game.

Forward Kenny Morris turned
two Ray LaRoche passes into a
pair of goals, while John Provost
added the third goal on a penalty
kick to rally the Dukes, now 7-
1-2, from a 1-0 halftime deficit.

A healthy gathering at Smith
Field saw the Generals jump to
a 1-0 yead with six minutes gone,
when Chuck Alexander scored off
a Billy Cogar pass. Madison ap-
plied the pressure throughout the
first half, only to have several
threats broken up by the W&L
fulbacks, led by Barclay Arm-
strong. At the same time Gen-
erals’ goalie Paul Devine was
playing faultlessly, making 13
first half saves including a rob-
bery of a high driving blast by
LaRoche midway through the
opening period.

But the Dukes broke the game
open in the second half. Morris
tied the score at 1-1 with just
1:40 gone. Five minutes later,
after a tripping penalty against
Wé&L, Provost scored on a pen-
alty kick which Devine blocked
but could not hold, Three minutes
after that, Morris scored again,
as LaRoche set him up with a
centering pass through three
WEL defenders.

Then the Dukes defense, spear-
headed by Nino Altamonte, shut
off the Generals’ offense until
Jim Fox seored on a head shot
with 5:14 to play. The loss drop-
ped W&L to 1-1-2 heading into
yesteday’s home match with
Washington (Md.) College. The
Generals host Virginia Tech at
2 p.m, on Saturday.

the hands of Moran, who, with
Kelley and linebacker Ed Keefer
throwing key blocks, rambled 35
yards untounched into the end
zone, Simons’ kick was good.

Two plays later, Bobby Rid-
dicks stepped in front of Eamon
Cassell for a third theft, returning
it 26 yards to the W&L 10. But
the Generals’ defense didn’t
budge, forcing Simons to kick a
22-yard field goal making it 13-0
with 12:59 left in the quarter.

Later in the quarter the Tigers
staged their best offensive drive
of the night, moving from their
16 to the W&L 3. But a clipping
penalty moved the ball out to the
18. Then Simons returned and
kicked another 35-yarder to send
H4S to a 16-0 lead.

On the following series the Gen-
evals, aided by two interference
calls, moved to the Tiger 28, But
another interception, this one by
linebacker Dusty Balblard, killed
a W&L scoring threat.

Another mistake cost W&L a
scoring chance in the fourth
quarter, when a nifty 41-yard punt
return by Charlie Brown was
nullified by an illegal blocking
penalty.

It was Brown, the victim of

WésL needs

another homecoming

(Continued from Page 2)
homecoming far too early this
year; in fact if you’re not aware
of the fact—homecoming is over.
Ironically, this blunder has given
us the opportunity to have
another big weekend this fall.
This means one thing ... we've
got to have another homecoming!
Let's greet Shirley Majors and
Sewanee mext weekend with
another homecoming queen and
celebrate the victory with a grain
party and combo for the uni-
versity.

Now there are many sober and

the ‘hat. If the SAB can’t swing
their “biggie” for sometime that
weekend in Red Square or the
Pavilion, let’s get a combo or
have a tapes combo like last
spring and save the money for
grain.

If we have to rearvange sched-
ules or reach back for a dollar
or two let's do it. | think it would
be kind of nice to be the only
school wild enough to have two
homecomings, and I think the

voices from the past would agree,

OUTLOOK andREVIEW

3

Roadimental
Existence

In the immediate past it has been our policy to address
ourselves to issues of immediate and unceasing concern to the
W&L student. We have endorsed apathy, swilling and ay
form of indulgence which tends to keep young men happy and
healthy. These endorsements have, for the most part, been of
a generalized nature, not dealing with specific proposals or
recommendations—except in wishing the Executive Commit-
tee a good banquet this year.

Perhaps it is time to address those who require concrete
suggestions in order to understand the scope of these argu-
ments fully, There is undoubtably a large and inaudible group
of students which is so apathetic that it can hardly stir itself
to think of something trivial to wile away the hours. To
these fine lumps of lethargy we say “congratuations” for your
non-accomplishment but would hazard an opinion in saying
that you are probably overdoing the apathy routine, The only
reason to be apathetic about what the rest of the world
considers important is that this allows one more time for
pleasure. It is to this group which practices lethargy even
to the exclusion of gross indulgence, i.e. about 22% of all
students and 96.7% of the administration, that we here would
like to draw some comparisons between different means of
gratifying oneself.

The list of sins for which W&L men have traditionally
shown extraordinary talent is so extensive that it has yet to
be completed (which is surprising in view of the fact that it
was begun before speech replaced sign language.) However,
students here have always been particularly adept at enter-
taining young ladies “down the road” at hot spots like West-
ern State, Eastern Mennonite, Amherst County High School
and Xavier Hollander’s School for Unclaimed Girls.

As there are many different campuses (or camp!) for
W&L men to haunt besides their own, so also are there
several types of road trips open to the willing student. Road
trips may be made at any and every time that the student
so inclined is not too hung from the night before to rouse
himself to the challenge.

All road trips fall into one of two catagories : Mid-Week
Road or Weekend Road, Of these options the first is perhaps
the more widely practiced. Gentlemen find the pleasures of
academia in many cases a sad second for a Wednesday “hump
night” road trip. This type is well known to most and follows
4 standard format—down the road with some friends, swill
in a big way, get none, chased by Pinkertons, and left by
“friends” to spend the night on alien soil, We have always
heen led to believe that a church is one of the better spots
for the one-night visit.

A somewhat inferior substitute for weekday road is week-
end road. Students visit the same old places, or sometimes
even steer their courses for as far away as C’ville or Farm-
ville. We have been doing something of a comparative study
of Weekend Road and Weekday Road in the past few weeks,
and have found the first to be infinitely weaker than the
second,

in our quest for a full understanding of the two phe-
nomenon in question we visited the campuses of U, of Va.
and Hampden-Sydney on successive weekends, We went to
U.Va. with a Hollins date; we made the trip to H-S with half
a date of unknown origin. Both visits were made on what
were supposedly “party” weekends, From what can be re-
membered of these two occasions, the schools in question
were not singularly impressive or impressed,

Girls’ schools are for the most part deserted on the w eek-
ends: it takes a bold man to go down to Macon on a Satur-
day night without having given the lady he intends to call
any prior notice, or at least contacting the dating service
provided by the Pinkertons in cooperation with the Lyneh-
burg kennels.

Times and tastes may have changed but the basics like
Swiss burgers, snow juice, gaping and going down the road
between Monday and Friday remain as the very foundations
of our civilization. Perhaps in a future era when man has
evolved to a more perfect state the road will instinctively
come to him, Until that comes to pass it will continue to be
necessary for W&I. men to seek out the road and its all too
unreliable pleasures or be left with only one viable alterna-

tive—sleep.

America, take heart. Deep in
ithe federal bureaucracy there
thrives a bureaucrat who has a
sense of humor. Believe it or not.

Not long ago, it seems, a bu-
reaucrat of a different stripe—a
toiler in the vineyard of academe,
Frank Parsons, assistant to Presi-
dent Huntley, which in part
means form«preparer—was work-
ing on an endlessly long applica-
tion for funds to be used in ‘build-
ing W&L’'s proposed new library.

The form demanded answers to
thousands of questions, it seemed,
and a few of them were even
sensible. But as it went on, it
began to resemble an adventure
in the Twilight Zone.

For instance: “Describe and
quantify, where possible, ‘how
your proposed action”—building
a library—“may affect energy
sources by introducing or delet-
ing electro-magnetic wave sources
which may alter man-made or
natural structures or the physi-
ology, behavier patterns, and/or
activities of 10 ‘per cent a
human, animal or plant popula-
tion.”

And ditto for sub-surface drain-
age, changes in wind patterns,
creation of “sounds which dis-
rupt delivery of services,” in-
terruption of services to the aged

and infirm—literally everything
Health, Edueation and Welfare,
the nation’s most skilled bureau-
cracy, could think of,

Eventually Parsons came to the
section on animal populations, To
what exent, HEW wanted to
know, would the proposed library
“oreate or ipercipitate an identifi-
able long-term change in the di-
versity of species within its na-
tural habitat?”

That did it. Parsons, who says
ihe looks on his job of filling out
federal applications as ‘penance
for past and future sins, replied:

“Phere are some 10 to 20 squir-
rels living, or appearing to live,
in the site proposed for the new
library. Some trees that now pro-
vide either homes or exercise
areas for the squirrels will be
removed, ‘but there appear to be
ample other trees to serve either
or both of these purposes. No
major food source for the squir-
rels will be affected.

“It is likely that the squirrels
will find no difficulty in adjust-
ing to this intrusion into space
heretofore their domain. They
have ‘had no apparent difficulty
in adjusting to — relocations
brought on by non-federally sup-
ported projects.

“The squirries are the most
visible inhabitants of the site;

Thursday, October 24, 1974

there are occasional sightings of
rabbits, skunks and snakes. No
effort has been made to date to
determine whether these are resi-
dent or transients. Some birds
nest in trees that will be remov-
ed, but as noted earlier, there is
no seareity of other, equally suit-
able trees that will remain.

“Inseet population is normal. .”

The feds pressed on relentless-
ly. “To what exent,” HEW asked
next, “will your proposal create
or precipitate an identifiable
change in the behavior patterns of
an animal population?”

Parsons’ reply: “As noted
above, the squirrels will have to
make some adjustments. They are
generally friendly now, ranging
somewhere between the appro-
achability of your general ‘capi-
‘tol square’ type of squirrel en-
tirely dependent on ‘human hand-
outs and those skittish ones com-
pletely wild. They appear to ac-
cept students and others about,
but none has ever been seen ac-
cepting food from a human’s
hand,

“It will ibe difficult to tell if
‘they're unhappy about having to
find new ‘trees ‘to live in and
sport about. Otherwise no change
in their behavior pattern is an-
ticipated.”

And HEW; “To what exent will

Letters to the editor...

Response to Flesher

editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

The last time I was exhorted
to go out and support my team
was senior year in high school.
And, even, then, the team during
my senior year in high schoo!
posted a 7-1 mark during the
football season.

I am somewhat short of words
to describe the feeling which
your sports editor left with me
after I read said exhortation in
last week's Ring-tum Phi, The
last time I was so asked to lend
support to a team, that support
was in the form of a standing
ovation, ordered by our athletic
director of our high school. He
merely told us to stand up and
give the team a standing ovation.

The effect is the same in both
instances. Any support shown be-
cause of an exhortation to show
support is no support at all.

A team worthy of support
earns it. This is not to say that
the Washington and Lee foothal!
team does not work hard to-
ward its achievement of an 0-5-1
season; I'm sure it does. Yet, |
am equally sure that participants
in other extra-curricular activi-
ties work just as hard. I am
speaking of the members of the
Student Activities Board (well,
again, some of them anyway),
and even some of the members
of the Phi staff.

The question, then, is: why
should we go out and rah-rah-
rah it for the football team? It
is certainly not because of the
amount of work put into the
game by its players; that work
ix easily matched by the acconyp-
lishments of many other persons
involved in many other activities
on campus, And, it is certainly
not because football is the only
sport around here. Indeed, even
the blessed pages of the Phi shun
some sports as we, the W&L com-

munity members, shun football,
Why not be so damned enthusi-
astic and reh-rah-rahish about
cros-country and soccer?

And, it is certainly not be-
cause of the team’s record,

The point is that many persons
in the W&L student body, inelud-
ing a number of football players,
came here because of the sup-
posed non-emphasis on sports
here. | know I did. I came here
because sports was a simple thing,
not a conyputer-oriented creation
of a multi-million dollar athletic
department. I came here for an
education; | could have gone to
Penn State, Oklahoma, or Ala-
bama if | wanted a football fac-
tory.

Mr. Flesher, don’t bother us

the complaints are:

1) Loud noise which disturbs
students when they are studying.

2) Destruction of furniture in
Fairfax Lounge and the dining
room lounge.

3) Destruction of machines in
the same room.

1) Excessive noise in the halls
immediately outside the TV room
as students try to watch TV.

5) Playing games, e.g. chase,
in the TV room while students
are trying to wateh the TV.

6) Playing games and wrestl-

HEW learns of W&L squirrels |

your (proposal bring about an
identifiable genetic change with-
in an animal population or po-
tential capacity to create a genetic
change in animal populations?”

Parsons: “The library would ap-
pear to have no capacity for af-
fecting the squirrels’ or other
animals’ genes.”

The application was duly ship-
ped off, and ultimately reached
the Division of Training and Faci-
lities, Bureau of Post-Secondary
Education, Office of Education,
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, Washington, D.C.

And somebody ‘there actually
read it. Next thing Washington
and Lee knew, the director of
that formidably named agency
dispatched a letter to the presi-
dent of ithe university demonstrat-
ing that not every federal func-
tionary is sullen and humorless:

“Occasionally,” wrote Richard
R. Holden, “bureaucrats like my-
self feel we have minimized red
tape and simplified application
forms to the nth degree . .
Fortunately, we meet our match
from time to time...

“Perhaps bureaucracy — will
tremble, but | salute Washington
and Lee University The
Mountain of ‘paperwork which
confronts me daily somehow
seemed much smatler the day f
read about the squirrels in Lex-
ington. May they and your great
university co-exist in harmony
for many, many years.”

Zevox copies of what came to
be known as the “squirrel memo”
began to find their way all
through the HEW web. Federal
bureaucrats from everywhere
found excuses to telephone the
“squirrel memo man” and con-
gratulate him on beating them
at their own game. There were
almost enough calls and letters,
in fact, to keep Parsons from fill-
ing out other federal forms for
a week or two.

Which, come to think of it,
would probably have suited the
bureaucracy just fine.

DEAR TRAVELLER—I spent an exciting homecoming trying to find
out who was supposed to provide all the fun and excitement for
homecoming weekend, My question js this: who was supposed to
provide all the fun and excitement for homecoming weekend?

Od t—You don't mean to tel] me that you missed all the great
events homecoming weekend? Such marvelous events as the prune-
kissing contest at Natural Bridge, or the wheelchair race for the
WEL class of '06, or the fishing contest off the footbridge (the
Winner snared a 46-pound 3-year-old kid to win that event).

Indeed, besides these great events, there was little for the
typical W&L man to enjoy. There was the footbal! game, which is
a basic form of entertainment—namely, slwpstick. Then there Was
the grain party, which was a basic form of entertainment—namely

In trying to find out what happened that weekend, we talked
to Students’ Activity Board chairman John Killpack, who replied
“I's Student Activities Board, idiot, not Students’ Activity Board "
He then sat back in his leather chair in his office high atop the
University Center and muttered something about why SABU
has to have almost the same initials as SAB. It appeared to this
reporter that the remark was made to no one in particular, save
perhaps the gin and tonic in Kilkpack's hand.
“There was a lot to do that weekend,” Killpack insisted. “What

WeéeL hosts tourney

Defending champion University
of Richmond is favored to win
the fourth annual Virginia Inter-
collegiate Water Polo Champion-
ships ‘this weekend at the Wash-
ington and Lee University pool.

The Spiders have four return-
ing All-State players and are
bolstered by several strong fresh-
men. Richmond is coached by
Hungarian National player Alex
Szilassy.

Washington and Lee, undefeat-
ed in three early scrimmages
against VMI, Virginia Common-
wealth and Lynchburg, is seeded
second in the tournament. Coach
Bill Stearns’ Generals have fin-
ished as the runner-up team for
the past three years.

Seeded, in order, behind Rich-
mond and W&L are the Rich-
mond ‘B’ team, VMI, VCU, Lynch-
burg, Old Dominion and either
the VMI or W&L ‘B’ teams. The
last two will play Thursday
afternoon to determine — the
eighth place seed.

W&L will be

Fall I-Ms
wind down

to playoffs

Intramural Fall sports are
winding down with the finals in
Golf, Tennis and Football held
this week. In I-M Golf, the SAE’s
made the finals. They were led
all season long by the deadly
shooting of George McChesney, a
senior, and Hux Brown, who aver-
aged below 40 for nine ‘holes. In
the semis Brown shot 37 in de-
feating PKPsi.

In I-M Tennis, PDT and Law 2
squared off in the finals. The Phi
Delts beat a good LCA team in
the semis 2-1. They were led by
John Friesner in the singles and
Kenny Mendelson and ‘had
Grundy in the doubles. For the
Law School, Tom Schmutz has
been the big gun all year, going
undefeated. In three macthes
against the very best that fra-
ternities had to offer, he allowed
only 5 games, while winning 30.

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

Over ithe past year or so, Wash-
ington and Lee has learned that
offense is THE name of the game
at Towson State.

In January Verne Canfield’s
basketball Generals saw a fast-
breaking Tiger five “shoot the
eyes out of it” to rally for a one-
point win.

And who can forget last year’s
classic lacrosse battle, which saw
Towson literally score at will
throughout the game, only to have
a frantic W&iL rally thwart the
Tigers’ wpset bid.

Now add the Generals’ footbal!
team to ‘the hist as a victim of
a Niger point barrage.

Led by the pinpoint passing of
Dan Dullen, Towson State rolled
up 653 offensive yards in waltz-
ing to a 63-16 Homecoming win
over W&L, who, in a direct turn-
about from the Hampden-Sydney
game, were basically helpless to
step the Tigers’ explosive offense.

Dullea, who entered the game
as the fourth leading passer in
the NCAA, Division TII, did
nothing to hurt his ranking as he
devastated the General secondary
with 19 of 26 completions for 344
yards and three touchdowns.

Split end Pat Barrett, who had
seven receptions for 139 yards,
hauled in scoring aerials of seven
and 66 yards, while Dullea’s third
scoring strike was a 6l-yard
screen pass to fullback K. P.
Dovie. Late in the game reserve
quarterback Scott O’Brien added
a fourth touchdown through the
air when he found Gary Worm-
ersley in the end zone with a 16-
vard pass.

The other five Tiger touch-
downs came out of the backfield,

down, finding Moore in the end
zone on a fourth-and-goal play
from the Tiger 8. The same duo
teamed for a two-pointer to make
the score 56-16, Late in the game

been missing against Hampden- <6 oe .
Sydney by picking up 337 yards.
Drives of 80 and 73 yards re-
sulted in the Generals’ touch-
downs, the first a 12-yard pass
from Jack Berry to Tony Perry;
the second an eight-yarder from
freshman Don Smith to class-
mate John Moore. W&L added
their conversions on passes from
Berry to Mark George and from
Smith to Moore.

Both Berry and Smith had good
passing days. The junior co-cap-
tain connected on 11 of 24 for
150 yards, while the freshman
signal-caller hit six of nine passes
for 86 yards. Perry led the re-
ceiving comps with seven catches
for 113 yards, while Moore caught
four passes for 60 yards.

came on a two-point conversian
pass from Dullea to Barnett, four
PAT kicks, and a 30-yard field
goal by Terry O’Brien. In all, the
Tigers put points on the board

This week the emphasis may
again ‘be on defense as the people
from the mountain, the Sewanee
Tigers invade Lexington for a

1:30 battle.

The Tigers scored on four
straight possessions in the first
and second quarters to take a
25-0 lead. The Tigers defense set
all the scores up by twice re-
covering W&L fumbles, and twice
ablowing the Generals to move
nowhere on offense.

Then came the 80-yard W&L
scoring march, in which Berry
threw five of six passes, the last
one to Perry for the touchdown.
The Berry-to-George pass closed
the gap to 25-8.

However that was as Close as
the Generals got all day. Towson
State added 11 more points be-
fore intermission on ‘the 66-yard

Dullea-to-Barrett pass, the two-

Towson - 63, Generals - 16

The Tigers, 2-3 on the year,
have won their last two starts
by whitewashing Austin (5-0)
and Southwestern (7-0). Sewanee

has also lost two shutouts to

Indiana Central (13-0) and Hamp-
den-Sydney (15-0). The Tigers’
other defeat was at the hands of
Centre, 19-14.

The game, to be played at
Wilson Field, will feature the re-
newal of the rivalry between
Sewanee head coach Shirley Ma-

jors and Generals’ defense men-

whom are the closest of allies.

been named by the rector of
Washington and Lee University’s
board of trustees to continue the
board's study of coeducation and
its consequences.

The board has been examining
the question of whether Wash-
ington and Lee should admit
women to its undergraduate di-
visions—and what the consequ-
ences would be if it did—for more
than five years. The action taken
by E. Marshall Nuckols Jr., the

newly clected rector, pinpoints
the responsibility for carrying
out that long-range study in a
specific committee.

Chairman of the
committee is Frank C. Brooks,
a Baltimore insurance’ broker.
Serving with him are Joseph T.
Lykes Jr. of Metarie, La., presi-
dent of Lykes-Youngstown Corp.,
H. Gordon. Leggett Jr. of Lynch-
burg, manager of personnel and
public relations for Leggett De-
partment Stores, and Dr. Edgar

Amendment would help

state’s private schools

SPECIAL TO THE PHI

Washington and Lee has a big
stake in the way Virginians vote
Nov. 5 on the statewide referen-
dum question about an amend-
ment to the Virginia constitu-
tion’s provisions for higher ed-
ucation.

Administrators
and one inmate
on prison forum

A panel discussion on Vir-
ginia’s corrections system, led
by four prison and rehabilita-
tion administrators and one in-
mate, will take place Monday at
7 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

The panel, titled “After Trial

Before Release,” is sponsored
iointly by Washington and Lee's
Interfraternity Council, the stu-
dent government Executive Com-
mittee, the University Federa-
tion, and the Lexington Jaycees.

Chairman of the program is
Paul McE. Fleming, a W&L sen-
ior. Panelists will be Charles F.
Vol{fe, deputy director of the
state Department of Correction;
Louis Wayne Moore, institutional
rehabilitation supervisor at the
Virginia State Penitentiary; Sue
lL. Kennedy, treatment program
supervisor at the penitentiary;
Robert DeLisie, administrative
assistant to the penitentiary sup-
erindendent, and Jim Clements

an inmate and former presi-
dent of the Spring Street Jay-
cces.

The ballot question asks a yes
or no vote as to whether the
constitution should be amended
to permit the legislature to make
grants to Virginia residents who
want to attend private colleges
in Virginia. Coupled to this pro-
vision is another that would per-
mit contracts for educational
services between private colleges
and various state and local gov-
ernments and their agencies, in-
cluding public colleges and uni-
versities.

According to a W&L spokes-
man, the measure is a refine-
ment of existing constitutional
provisions that provide for grants
and loans to students going to
tax-supported institutions but
only loans for Virginians wishing

to attend Virginia private col-
leges.
The part of the amendment

dealing with contracts for educa-
tional services could mean greater
cooperation between Virginia
Military Institute and W&L, the
W&L spokesman points out. Only
informal cooperation has been
possible under existing law.

Approval of the amendment
would be an important step in
helping narrow the tuition gap,
according to the W&L spokes-
man.

‘Private college costs have al-
ways run higher than expenses
at public institutions,” he points
out, “and private colleges are not
trying to bring about equaliza-
tion through state assistance. All
we hope to achieve is a restora-
tion of the acceptable difference,
a workable balance between tul-
tion levels in the public and pri-

vate sectors.’

SAC meets with UC;
conduct proposal slated

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee will go before the University
Council tonight to present a
“standards of conduct” proposal.
rhe committee, which functions
as an appeal body for the stu-
dent, is recommending that the
UC adopt a statement as to what
tudent organization handles
which discipline and the extent
of its power to do so.

The “standards of conduct” to
be presented tonight at the
meeting are of no great consequ-
enee according to Student Body
President Ben Bailey. In his
words they are not too much
more than a “rewording of last
vear's standards

The trustees’ interest in con-
tinuing the study of coeduca-
tion was expressed at the May
mecting of the board when mem-
bers authorized the rector to
name a committee with responsi-
bility for “fact-finding.” The
board declared that the fact of
the ongoing study was not to be
interpreted as an indication that
it either favored or opposed co-
education.

At the time the committee was
authorized last May, the board
expected that it would make its
report at an early point in the
current academic year. The sub-
sequent illness and death of Ross
L. Malone, then rector, delayed
the appointment of a committee
until the board's October meet-
ing.

OUTLOOK and REVIEW.

...and by their bathroom walls
Ye shall know them

—Whipple’s Baby

For years campus politicos and Washington Hallites have
been frantically searching for a single, valid satistic or measure
by which they can gauge the student body, For example, a
curriculum committee wants to find out student reaction to
different courses and teachers and the academic calender, A
dean wants to learn how transfer students are faring in their
first year at Washington and Lee. The Athetic Department
senses a falling off in student support and wants to find an
answer (as if that is not obvious with their records), There
is indeed one eternal standard by which all these various facets
of student life can be accurately placed in their proper per-
spective—grafliti.

We hope this assertion will not offend the sensibilities of
some of our more refined readers who are unaccustomed to
looking to a bathroom wall for great insights into our civiliza-
tion. We do, however, believe that even the most common
latrine partition can be turned into a work of art which would
certainly dazzle Neanderthal man in comparison with his
own cave art and would facinate the duPont masters for much
the same reason.

This type of expression is obviously one which intrigues
the student a great deal. In fact, the art has been so widely
diffused throughout the student body that the walls of its
proudest galleries must be scrubbed down several times each
year when the graffiti becomes so thick that new additions are
impossible to read.

The acme of this ancient art form can be found on the
second floor of McCormick Library in the music wing. Here
are inscribed words of wisdom and gems of knowledge which
would be the pride of any poet or scholar, On the walls of
this Bohemian retreat live the deeds of faculty and students
alike, side by side, limerick to limerick,

In this hallowed gallery the words of Joe Lyles are im-
mortalized next to a recounting of who has the latest and
most fashionable diseases.

Besides the artistic value of these clever graffiti, they have
a practical side which should prove beneficial for those who
would desire to feel the pulse of the school. We might recom-
mend that Dean John inspect these writings every Friday to
keep up with youth in the same way that we are sure Murph
does. President Huntley might do well to go over to Me-
Cormick or even the Commerce School to learn the latest
smut that is being fabricated about him.

Just think—printed course evaluation questionnaires could
become a thing of the past if only those in charge would spend
more time enjoying the living word of Washington and Lee.

The Admissions Office could make use of this student
forum in reeruiting and selecting candidates. Dean Farrar
could take a prospective student to any gentleman's lounge
and give him thirty seconds to add his own graffiti, Based
on this demonstration of the lad’s mental quickness, second-
floor Washington Hall would have a solid foundation on
which to make its selections of those candidates to be invited
to join us. We feel that this foolproof method would certainly
be preferable to the method now being utilized—which is
something like pin the tail on the donkey.

We only wish to point out that the W&L civilization is
plastered all over the vertical surfaces of countless rooms on
this campus and that no one has taken advantage of this
wealth of information. Remember, graffiti is both a spectator
and a participant sport. To ignore either of these aspects of
the art is to receive less than a liberal arts education, With-
out grafitti the brilliant culture we have nurtured in this place
will be forgotten in the future and mankind will be completely
unaware of the way we were, A graffito a day to the glory
of the school is the very least we can do!

A tradition resurrected

We would like to take this opportunity to applaud the
reinstitution of worship services in Lee Chapel, The resur-
rection of this tradition can be attributed to the efforts of
Clay Jackson and David Pittman, along with the other mem-
bers of the Lee Chapel Worship Committee, This accomplish-
ment is due completely to the interest of a few students who
felt called upon to honor the memory of General Lee in a very
special way.

For this concern and respect for the proud traditions of
Washington and Lee, we believe recognition and appreciation

Are grades getting higher?

By PAUL LANCASTER

Managing Editor

Editor’s note—This is the first in
a series of articles on grading at
Washington and Lee. This week,
The Ring-tum Phi managing
editor Paul J. Lancaster investi-
gates the topic of grade inflation.

In 1967-69, the average under-
graduate senior at Washington
and Lee University was gradu-
ated with a 2.597 grade point
ratio. Last May, the average un-
dergraduate senior won his de-
gree with a 2.761 GPR.

In 1967-68, 15.6 percent of all
grades awarded to undergradu-
ates at Washington and Lee were
grades of ‘A’’. Last year, 22.6 per-
cent of all grades were grades
oe".

The terminology being tossed
around the campus in reference
to this rise in GPR’s and per-
centages of “A” marks is ap-
propriate to the times. The term-
inology is “grade inflation.”

And, that terminology is being
tossed around the campus more
this year than ever before. Grade
inflation is becoming a favorite
topic of the faculty committee
on Courses and Degrees, and it
has also been discussed in the
monthly faculty meetings and in
the monthly meetings of the stu-
dent-faculty forum, the Univer-
sity Council.

Certainly, grade inlation is not
peculiar to Washington and Lee.

In fact, the rate of grade infla-
tion at Washington and Lee is
lower than the national rate.
The net rise in the GPR at Wash-
ington and Lee from 1966-67 to
1973-74 has been .231. The net
rise nationally in that same
period of time is approximately
.298, according to The Chronicle
of Higher Education.

The Oct. 7 issue of The Chron-
icle of High Education quotes
results of a national study con-
ducted by Arvo E. Juola, acting
director of evaluation services at
Michigan State University. The
study investigates grade infla-
tion at nearly 200 colleges across

He does, however, offer other
suggestions.

On possibility, Juola says, is
what he calls a “readjustment
from the rather harsh grading
standards adopted during the
post-Sputnik period.” The
Chronicle of Higher Education
also says Juola thinks schools
were trying to limit enrollment
in the early 1960's.

Another possibility suggested
in the study is a general shift
in student-faculty relationships
caused by increasing student
activism in the 60's. Juola sug-
gests that student demonstra-
tions may have led to making

the student now has fewer credits
with which to contend during the
fall and winter terms than was
the case six or more years ago.
A student now takes 12 to 14
credits in each of these terms.
Before, the student carried more
than that number, usually 15 or
greater.

Secondly, there is the spring
term, It’s as simple as that. Last
spring, 30.2 percent of all grades
given during that six-week term
were “A” grades. Statistics from
the university registrar's office
show that nearly half of the
undergraduate student body took
only one course last spring. This

the country. The study found an
average increase in grade-point
average of .404 from 1960 to 1973.

Why the rise in grades? Juola’s
study suggests several possibili-
ties. He first suggests that the
possibility that students these
days are brighter than in the
early 1960's is unsubstantiated.

Shaffer’s ‘“Equus’-
difficult & beautiful

By BARNEY SKELTON
Entertainment Editor

Above all else Peter Shaffer's
Equus is a play which asks ques-
tions. However, the queries posed
are not of the type which can
be shrugged off easily or laid
aside with melifluous rhetoric.
Rather, they hit one in the gut
and demand answers despite the
fact that reason and empirical
thought are incapable of cop-
ing with them.

This is the dilemma in which
psychiatrist Martin Dysart, play-
ed by Lecky Stone, finds him-
self. He is confronted with a
teenage boy Alan Strang, Will
Cantler, who has gouged out the
eyes of several prize horses. In
the course of his sessions with
Alan, Dysart gradually begins to
realize the impotence of his
science in dealing with the boy
and finds himself becoming as
much the patient as the patient
himself. Thus the core of the
play revolves around this doc-
tor/patient, patient/patient re-
lationship. The rest of the char-
acters figure only in as much as
they amplify this relationship.

Thus, the extreme difficulty of
the role of Dysart lies in his
virtually perpetual stage presense
and the change he undergoes
from the cool, objective psychi-
atrist to the profoundly shaken
and introspective person he is by
the end of the play. Furthermore,
aside from the mime, there is
very little physical action in the
play; Dysart’s change in char-
acter must be portrayed almost
entirely through word inflection
and thought process.

Through a good part of the
first act it seemed as though Mr.
Stone was having a bit of a dif-
ficulty with this most delicate
of acting problems. The feeling
of Dysart’s dilemma simply was
not there. It was not until Prank
and Dora Strang, the parents of
the afflicted boy, played by
David DeChristopher and Mary
Ann Nabor, came on the stage
that the pace really picked up
and got moving. DeChristopher
did an excellent job as the hard-
nosed, atheistic father and serv-
ed as the perfect foil to Miss
Nabor's rendition of the “bleed-
ing-heart” religious fanatic that
she portrayed so well. Shortly
after the entrance of the parents,
the character of Dysart and his
relationship with Alan begins to
gel.

Will Cantler, as Alan-—a role
somewhat similar to that he
protrayed in Royal Hunt last
year, is to be commended for
capturing the petulence driven
by the inner torment which
causes the character to turn the
tables on Dysart and ask the
doctor, “What's your dream?”
This is certainly the prime role

of Alan: while Dysart is exorcis-
ing the horse-god Equus out of
Alan's mind, the boy is in turn
dashing apart the shell which
the doctor has built around his
own inner feeling by continually
probing his dream, his dark
secret. One's only objection to
Mr. Cantler’s performance might
be that he does not build up the
piteh of his final encounter with
Equus to a new and terrifying
height of agonized torment. In
this last scene Alan finds himself
unable to make love to a young
girl owing to the onlooking eyes
of the jealous horse-god. Regret-
tably, the feverishness of his
earlier stage encounter with
Equus seemed equally pronounc-
ed, whereas the climax at the
end should have been more
powerful.

It is really in the second act
that the power of the play takes
hold. Dysart realizes his ultimate
ineffectiveness, Mr. and Mfrs.
Strang give up in bewilderment
and young Strang seeks more
and more to purge himself of the
god he has created. All the actors
did an excellent job in rendering
the energy and force that the
play possesses and in general the
second act entirely makes up for
anything the first act lacked.

Not to be dismissed however, is
the prime importance that the
technical aspects of the play pos-
sessed. The lighting, cinematic,
and sound effects produced were
vital in their task of perpetuat-
ing the mystery and verisimili-
tude of the play, especially given
the limitations imposed by the
stage of the Troubadour Theater.
Particularly worth noting was
the film projection of Dysart’s
dream of the Delphic priests.

The inexorable presence of the
horses is, of course, the most
powerful leitmotif of the play
and the effectiveness of their
mime portrayals are vital. They
must seem mysterious gods, not
laughable animals. John Har-
grove as Nugget, and certainly
the rest of those involved in the
mime should be congratulated
for maintaining this air of the
bizarre and macabre which the
horses exude,

In the final analysis, as the
reviewer of Equus, one feels al-
most the same emotions as Mar-
tin Dysart. One cannot simply
talk of the play as being some-
thing “out there” which one is
observing, just as Dysart could
not ask Alan Strang of his
horse-god without asking many
questions of himself. It is a play
which demands personal involve-
ment of both cast and audience,
and Lee Kahn and the Univer-
sity Theatre players are to be
congratulated for their rendi-
tion of such a difficult, but beau-
tiful work of art.

the faculties around the country
more conscious of student views,
and the demonstrations may have
prompted curricular changes to
more “relevant” studies.

Juola also says the trend of
grade inflation may now be level-
ing off nationally. He says the
rate of inflation appears to be
slowing.

This may be true at Washing-
ton and Lee, too. For example,
the average senior grade point
ratio increased nearly .05 from
1970-71 to 1971-72, and again
from 1972-73. But the GPR in-
creased only .026 from 1972-73
to 1973-74.

Why have grades inflated ai
Washington and Lee? Some of
the reasons given by Juola in
his national study no doubt ap-
ply to Washington and Lee, but
there are possibly other reasons.
The primary one may be the
change in the semester system
from two 15-week semesters to
a 12-12-6 week system.

There may be two reasons for
grade inflation linked to this
switch in the semester system,
which was made in 1970-71.
Firstly, there is the fact that

SS gS UME is ie EMER ca aR ate a got

certainly seems a contributing
factor toward a higher percent-
age of “A” grades.

In comparing grade inflation
by class (freshmen, sophomore,
junior, senior), it is evident that
the Washington and Lee junior
has benefited the most from—or
contributed the most to—grade
inflation. The junior GPR rose
.279 from 1966-67 to 1973-74.
And, seniors have recorded the
lowest rate of grade inflation
among the four undergraduate
classes—.202 in that same period
of time. Sophomores recorded a
.211 rise and freshmen a .232 rise
over that same period of time.

Though grade inflation is in
evidence at Washington and Lee,
it is not as pronounced as the
national trend of rising marks.
And, as of yet, there has been
little serious open discussion here
about a faculty crackdown on
this inflation. And, as of yet,
there appears to be little rea-
son to bring about such a crack-
down.

(Next week—a study of grad-
ing in the university by depart-
ment.)

Ask Traveller

DEAR TRAVELLER—I thought I saw the last of dress codes when

I was in elementary school.

How come the commerce school

jocks all wear khaki pants, topsiders, white shirt, and 1947 ties?

(Signed) E. Atwood

DEAR E.—Yes, an unwritten dress code does exist at Washington and
Lee, although it would be wrong to strictly call it a dress code.
It's more of a code of conduct, dating back to post-Civil War
times when General Lee required all his horses to shave and

shower regularly.

Anyway, the code is employed today primarily as a means of
distinguishing different fields of studies. You have picked out
the most obvious code—that of the C-school jock. It is the most
obvious because C-School people are perhaps the most unimagina-
tive bodies in the university. Their idea of a good time is trying
to figure out who Newcomb Hall is named after. (Last we heard.
the C-school had that problem narrowed down to two choices—

Dean Varner or Sidney Lewis.)

Yes, the C-school clan makes itself known in an obvious
fashion, as you have described above. But don't forget the other
facets of this university, They, too, have their codes of conduct.

For example—

Those in art walk around with a box of crayons in their back

hip pocket.
Those in music hum.

Those in history hum the Battle Hymn of the Republic.
Those in sociology ask you how you're doing, and they're

actually serious about it.

Those in psychology ask you how you're doing, and then they

wonder why your lying to them.

Those in philosophy ask you how.

Those in physics tell you how.

Those in drama walk around pretending they're trees.
DEAR TRAVELLER-——What was your major here?

DEAR UNSIGNED—Hummm.

(Signed) Unsigned

FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH—It is not intended to be the
common practice of this column to have to explain what it
meant by such-and-such a remark, Certain circumstances per-
taining to last week's column, however, force this writer to make
such an explanation. That an explanation was needed was raised
by a midnight visit of 16 members of the Student Association of
Black Unity to my dorm room last week, asking me to explain
the last section of my article regarding Fancy Dress ‘see last

week's article for details).

The point is that no comments derogatory to SABU or to
blacks on this campus in general were intended, Indeed, this
writer meant by the wording of the article to ridicule both the
Student Activities Board ‘yes, that is what that organization is
really called) in its decision to require tuxedoes for those attend-
ing this winter's Fancy Dress and the university's past policy
towards blacks—namely, complete exclusion from the university
except for instnees of servility. Nothing else was intended. Period.

It is hoped that this will be the first and only such explana-
tion needed in this column. Indeed, an explanation of the racial
meaning of the column last week is merited only by the fact
that there still exists an atmosphere of racism at Washington and
and Lee, whether on one or both sides of the fence.

for two goals late in regulation

with Washington and Lee a man
short in overtime to win the Vir-

Basketball

Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball team has started prepara-
tions for their 1974-75 season.

Head coach Verne Canfield
says that this year’s pre-season
workouts are more strenuous
than ever to make the team more
ready for the upcoming season,
but also admits that the players
are working harder.

The Generals will scrimmage
three times in November before
opening their season November
29 in Doremus Gymnasium
against Maryville College.

ginia State Water Polo Champ-
ionships 10-5, in Doremus Pool
on Saturday.

It was the second straight year
that the Spiders had captured
the state crown, and the second
year the Generals had finished
in the runnerup spot.

W&L, who lost to Richmond
in the winers’ bracket finals on
Friday, 7-5, ran out of men
with :30 seconds left when Dick
Barber fouled out. The Generals

were forced to play the rest of
the game six men aganist seven.

For the fourth year in a row
Barber, the Generals’ center
forward, was named the most
valuable player of the turna-
ment. Also named to the All-
State team were goalie Bill Tiers
and defenseman Jim Howard,
who earned the honor for the
second year in a row.

Four Richmond “A” players
rounded out the all-State team.

Harriers win seventh

Washington and Lee’s cross-
country team ran to their seventh
win of the season Saturday down-
ing West Virginia Tech, 24-33.

W&L co-captains Tem Wash-
ington and Jim McMenamin
paced the 12 runners over the
five-mile course with times of

28:19 and 39:05 respectively.
Tech’s James Sloan finished
third with a 29:23 time. W&L’s
Jesse O'Neal and Tech’s Robert
Layne rounded out the top five.

The Generals, now 7-4, host
Madison and Eastern Mennonite
on Saturday.

It was a long, long time in
coming, but everything finally
fell in place for Washington and
Lee’s football team Saturday.

And, as more than one player

was heard to say after the game,
“It couldn’t have come against
a more deserving opponent.”

Paced by the running of Mercer
West, the errorless play of the
offense, and a fine all-around
defensive effort, the Generals
ended their 13-game_ winless
spell with a 24-7 trouncing of
arch-rival Sewanee before a
gathering of 1500 loyalist at
Wilson Field.

The win earned W&L the re-
venge they had been seeking
against the Purple Tigers, who
last year, though leading 25-0,
went into a two-minute drill late
in the game, scoring a touchdown
on the game's final play for a
31-0 win.

“I was glad to see our players
come back from the nightmare
at Towson State (a 63-16 W&L
loss) to play 60 minutes of solid
football,” said W&L head coach
Bill McHenry after the game.

The Generals piled up 23 first
downs and 328 total offensive
yards against a Sewanee de-
fense which had allowed only
eight touchdowns in six previous
games. Almost two-thirds of the
total—209 yards—came on the
ground, as W&L ran the ball
63 times, twice as many rushes
as had been used in any game
this year.

West, a senior from Memphis,
Tenn., was the workhorse, carry-
ing 25 times for 126 yards. Nine
of the fullback’s blasts resulted
in first downs. West's effort
earned him offensive player of
the week honors.

Ironically, none of the four
W&L touchdowns came from the
fullback spot. Instead, the half-
backs did the scoring, as Rob
Lindsey, back in action after a
toe injury kept him sidelined in
the Towson State game, slammed
in three times from the one,
while freshman Raynard Scott,
who picked up 56 yards in 12
carries, added the fourth six-
pointer from two yards out.

The Generals had trouble add-
ing points after, however, as all
four PAT attempts, all for two
points, failed to reach the end
zone. McHenry noted that this,
as well as the kicking game,
were the only items on the down
side of the win.

Yet it was a punting situation
which proved to be the turning
point in the game. Just four
plays into the second half, W&L
chose to punt rather than try for
a first down on fourth and one
from their own 31. Freshman
George Makris, whose seven-
yard punt led to the Tigers’
lone touchdown in the first
quarter, took a low snap from
center and, on his own, decided
to run for the first down. He
made it by inches, keeping alive
a drive which later resulted in
Lindsey’s second tuochdown, giv-
ing the Generals the lead for
good at 12-7.

Sewanee got on the scoreboard
first after a Makris punt took
a reverse bounce before being
downed at the WL 33. Seven
plays later quarterbock Steve
Tipps found Chuck DeJaola with
an ll-yard scoring pass. Barry
Ray’s kick made it 7-0.

Early in the second period
W&L stopped a Tiger scoring
threat when linebacker Jeff
Slatcoff, the defensive player of
the game, intercepted a Ron
Swymer pass at the Generals’
eight, returning it 17 yards to
the W&L 25.

W&L then staged a 16-play,
75-yard scoring march, with
Lindsey scoring his first TD with
5:24 left in the half. Three times
during the march the Generals
were able to concert third down
situations to keep the drive alive.
Quarterback Jack Berry was
stopped short on a two-point at-
tempt, leaving W&L behind 7-6
at intermission.

W&L took the lead for good
with 8:07 remaining in the third
quarter as Lindsey capped a 78-
yard march in 15 plays with his
second one-yard scoring plunge.
West keyed the drive with six

carries for 35 yards, while Makris’

carry on the fourth down punt-
ing situation kept the drive a-
live. Again the Generals failed
on a two-point attempt, leaving
them with a 12-7 lead.

Sewanee came back and put to-
gether what was their last good
drive of the game, moving from
their own 38 to the W&L 22
before quarterback Tipps was
stopped short of a first down by
Slatcoff and Jeff Opp.

The Generals iced the game
with two touchdowns in the final
quarter. Both scores were set up
by Tiger turnovers.

Two plays into the period
Louis McFadden fell on a Brian
Landry fumble at the Sewanee
44. Berry connected on three
straight passes to move the ball
to the two, then handed off to
Scott, who slammed in over the
right side to make it 18-7. Again,
however, the Generals missed a
two-point attempt when line-
backer Dudley West picked off
a Berry pass.

Wé&L got the ball back one
play after the kick-off, when
Swymer, back in at quarterback
for the Tigers, underthrew wide
receiver Henry Rast, and Opp
intercepted at the Generals 44.

Berry then moved W&L for
their final touchdown, mixing
the run and the pass well in an
ll-play, 56-yard drive that end-
ed when Lindsey scored on
fourth-and-goal from the one for
his third touchdown of the game.
The fourth miss on a two-point
attempt gave the Generals a 34-
7 lead, which the defense made
stand up until the final seconds
ticked off the scoreboard.

It was an extra-special win
for the W&L defense, as well as
defensive coach Boyd Williams,
whose dislike for the Tigers was
a source of incentive for the Gen-
erals all week,

“We wanted to win it for
Coach Williams because we know
he'd rather beat ‘those people’
than anyone else,” said one de-
fensive player after the game.

But more important, the Gen-
erals finally beat someone, some-
thing they hadn't done in a long
time.

Independents meet,
plan for revival

By JOE FITZGERALD
Phi Staff Reporter

A meeting of the Independent
Union was called for Thursday,
Oct. 31, by Robert Piedrahita.
president. The meeting was called
in order to elect officers and dis-
cuss plans for the revival of the
lon-dormant organization. About

49 persons, mostly freshmen, at-
tended.

‘The officers elected included Ed
Ihurcess, vice-president, George
Cviffin, secretary, and Peter Lin,

treasurer. The president, Robert
Piedrahita was elected in last
month's general election.

All the officers are cautiously
optimistic about the future of the
Union. Ed Burgess thinks the union
should “provide social, academic
and athletic activities to provide
an alternative to our present fra-
tcrnity system’. George Griffin
edded that the independent can
“make with it what he wants”.
Treasurer Lin sees a more impor-
tant priority. “Money is the main
factor, I think”, he said. “Once we
eet money. we can do other
things”.

Robert Piedrahita is thinking
more about the future right now
than he is the immediate prob-
ioms. He is disappointed that more
people did not show up for the
meetine but feels their absence is
po problem. He is expecting great-
er participation once the IU gets

rolling and, in the words of

George Griffin. “takes up the

slack the fraternities leave.”

Piedrahita’s goals for the group

include chess clubs, a literary soc-

iety, intramural participation.
and a political club. A team was

Champagne

gathered for this week’s table
tennis intramurals, but it was or-
ganized too late to get on the
schedules.

A meeting of the officers was
on the agenda for last night to
discuss these goals and their pos-
sible implementation.

Student course survey released

By PAUL MORELLA
Phi Staff Reporter

The Student Curriculum Com-
mittee has released the results of
the curriculum survey conducted
last winter, which includes stu-
dent evaluations of most of the
courses offered in the winter
term,

The primary aim of the survey,

 

according to committee chair-
man Lawrence Lyles, is to pro-
vide an “aecurate, objective, and
constructive criticism of courses
and professors at W&L.” In addi-
tion. Lyles emphasized that
“every effort has been made to
insure the accuracy of these re-
sults.

UC okays
long holiday
next winter

By BOB PUGH
Phi Staff Reporter

The 1975-76 calendar submit-
ted by the faculty executive com-
mittee was approved last Thurs-
day by the UC.

Upon final approval by the ad-
ministration the calendar will in-
crease the Washington holiday
to nine days next year and move
commencement back to June 3.
The spring vacation will come
later than presently, April 9-19.
The fall term will not be affected.

The UC also reviewed the stu-
dent health committee's report
that found most complaints in-
volved poor communications be-
tween the infirmary staff and
ailing students. Prof. John Mc-
Daniel said that many times stu-
dents fail to heed the physician's
instructions to check back.

There have also been problems
admitting students to the hospi-
tal emergency room, but these
are being ironed out, McDaniel
said.

Students having complaints
with this or any other infirmary
procedures should submit written
complaints to Dean Lewis John
or another health committee
member.

The UC also reviewed the stu-
dent affairs committee's report
and euidance memorandum for
student discipline. There was a
great deal of debate about W&L
authority over acts that merely
reflect on the university, like
misconduct away from Lexing-
ton

Some expressed the thought
that this was extending the uni-
versity's jurisdieation too far, in
that it governs the lives of stu-
denst when they are not directly
connected with the university.

Others argued that these acts
could reflect adversely upon the
university's image since the indi-
would be characterized
as W&L students. They also con-

“B”, and that is the highest per-
centage of any department for
such grades.

And, the politics department
gave the highest percentage of
“C” grades, as nearly four out of
every 10 grades in the depart-
ment last year were such grades.

The math department leads in
percentages of “D” and “FP”
grades, with 10 and nine per-
cent, respectively.

The percentages listed above
are percentages of total grades
given by a department, ie. 46
percent of all history grades last
year were grades of “B”.

The percentages of “A” or “F”
or any other grades given in a
department cannot alone reflect
how “easy” that department is.

DEAR TRAVELLER—I'm a freshman who got blackballed by every
fraternity—even the Sigma Chi's, God forbid. Anyway, the point is
that I'm an independent. Who is this Robert Tetrahedron guy and
what is the Independent Union?
(Signed) B. Bailey

DEAR B.—No, dummy, it's Piedrahita, not tetrahedron. There's a big
difference. One has four facets, the other is facetless. Anyway, Mr.
Piedrahita ‘or is it Tetrahedron...) is vice-president of the Inde-
pendent Union, as elected by the independents on campus a few
weeks ago. Which means that he is president.

It's really very simple. Last year's Independent Union hierarchy,
which captured second place in the National Apathy Week look-
alike contest (the first-place team didn't bother showing up), didn't
bother with elections as deemed in the Independent Union constitu-
tion. And we know what happens when elections are botched up—
that’s right, they go to the Executive Committee to be botched up
even more. And the EC held true to is form.

Anyway, the EC, having already done so much for the Independent
Union, continued. That majestically weird body then decided to sche-
dule independent elections itself, forgetting the point that there is

an Independent Union constitution which specifies how elections are

to be held. So the EC scheduled elections with all the vigorous cam-
paign regulations reminiscent of the election of officers in Miss
Gesell’s third year grade class at Waddell Elementary School. The
EC deemed that anybody could run—no petitions or anything like
that, Just tell the EC you want to run and they'll take care of it,

As it turned out, only one person wanted to run—for any of the
four offices—and that was Mr. Tetrahedron ‘or is it Piedrahita .

He ran for vice-president, and he did very well, too, capturing the
votes of 60 persons who haven't even the vaguest idea of what they
were voting for. He, of course, was elected vice-president.

Meantime, no-one had been elected president, so the EC elected
Piedrahita ‘or is it Tetrahedron .) 8 president. My only question
is, Why didn’t the EC also elect him as treasurer and secretary, too,
as long as nobody ran for those offices

So, that is the current situation. There now exists an Independent
Union which is actually supposed to care about something. My only
second question here is, how do you organize independents? It
would seem independents are independents because they are inde-
pedents, not groupies, Anyway, Tetrahedron ‘or is it Piedrahita .. .)
is now going to organize the independents, which is kind of like ask-
ing President Ford to say something that doesn’t have to be clarified.

partments below the norm in-
clude military science (10%),

fine arts (17%), and languages

matics (9%), history (6%), ac-
counting and administration

osophy (5%). Departments below

ence (0%), journalism (1%), and
sociology (2%)

How can the anomolies from
the norm, as portrayed by the
higher percentage of high marks
in the fine arts, history, English,
and military science, for exam-
ple, or the higher percentage of
lower marks in economics and ac-
counting and administration, be
explained?

Certainly there are factors de-
termining the percentages of a
grade given by a department.
Some departments open a major-
ity of their courses to non-maj-
ors; this, it would seem, would
lower the percentage of of high
marks.

And the nature of the courses
is important. Certainly an intern-
ship or a like course deserves a
grading system different from
that of the norm of the univer-
sity. One example here is total

A man of God

visits campus

ty TRAVELER

Speaking to a crowd of between
150-153 abject sinners, Calvin
Wendell made his first appear-
ance on campus Monday spread-
ing the “good news,” (no, Dean
John did not burn his red knit
sportcoat). Calvin spoke of God
as one who had his own personal
hotline keeping him in touch with
his Source.

Calvin came to Lexington to
speak on the court house green
and ended up preaching on the
W&L lawn. This was not Calvin's
first visit to Lexington but it
could be said that it was his most
successful visit to date. The last
time he came here the city fath-
ers denied him permission to
spread the word of God.

Among the talents demonstrat-
ed by this wandering latter day
saint was an extraordinary abil-
ity to captivate his audience with
his voice. Most of the hymns he
sung were practically beyond the
understanding of any man rid-
died with sin and vice-conse-
quently no one on campus under-
stood them. His teachings were
basic and fundamental—that old
time religion.

It has been pointed out that
the crowd attracted to the front
lawn by his spectacle was larger
than any assembled since the
riots of the late sixties. Unfor-
tunately the enthusiasm of the
student listeners was not enough

to keep Murph’s second, Herman
Huffman, from telling the old
preacher that he had to leave.
Reluctantly Calvin withdrew but
not before he told several inter-
ested students how he was called
to God.

LETTERS TQ THE COITOR

Chapel services—
completely unnecessary

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi

As a former W&L student and
resident of Lexington for a num-
ber of years, it was with inter-
est that I read recently a letter
to you suggesting that worship
services be held in Lee Chapel.
What nonsense!

Robert E. Lee, as a military
man of some fame, turned to
peaceful pursuits only upon de-
feat. Why make a cult of his
memory? Second, why isn't one
chureh ‘Grace Church, or R. E.
Lee Episcopal, as it is commonly
called) on campus sufficient?
Third, and perhaps most impor-
tant, what about Jesus Christ's
injunction to his followers to go
into their “inner storerooms”
and closets to pray, rather than
holding public services including
prayer?

Interestedly,

Soccer falls to .500 after

Generals’ offense absent
as Lynx roll, 32-0

By BILL KLESHER
Phi Sports editor

As Washington and Lee's foot-
ball team boarded their charter
flight from Memphis to Roanoke
Saturday evening, one of the ste-
wardesses, in a very hostesslike
manner, asked W&L head coach
Bill McHenry how the Generals’
game with Southwestern went.

“Rotten! Terrible!” was the
coach’s only reply.

The stewardess apologized for
asking.

Unfortunately, the adjectives
McHenry used in his answer
closely described the Generals’
performance Saturday, as a stin-
gy Southwestern defense and sev-
eral key W&L mistakes led to a
32-0 drubbing for the Generals,
who again failed to win a foot-
ball game on the road.

The last time W&L emerged
victorious away from Wilson
Field was in 1971, when they
downed Washington (Mo.) Uni-
versity. Since then the Generals
have come close several times,
but have never found the winning
combination.

Against Southwestern,
didn’t even come close.

The Generals’ usually potent
offense was held to 106 total
yards by a Lynx defense that had
allowed only eight touchdowns
on the year. All but two of those
yards came through the air. And,
even upstairs, W&L found little
success.

they

Quarterback Jack Berry hit on
only six of 17 passes for 104 yards.
Two of his aerials were picked
off, as were two other passes, one
by freshman quarterback Don
Smith, the other by Tony Perry
on an end-around option pass.

Southwestern defensive back
Conrad Bradburn assumed the
villian’s role by intercepting two
of those passes, as well as scoring
two of the Lynx’s touchdowns,
one on a 63-yard punt return, the

other on a 66-yard kickoff return
following a safety against the
Generals early in the final per-
iod.

Bradburn had a third return
into the end zone called back by
a clipping penalty in the first
quarter, The junior defensive
back also broke up several passes
to round out what he called his
“finest football game ever.”

The Generals also had a six-
pointer called back in the open-
ing minutes on a very question-
able call. On fourth and six from
the Southwestern 34, Berry called
the end-around option play, with
Perry coming from his left end
position, taking a pitch from the
quarterback, and then either
running with or throwing the
ball.

As it was, the Lynx defense all
came up for the run, leaving wide
receiver Mark George wide open
in the end zone. Perry’s pass was
on target, and it appeared W&L
had taken a 6-0 lead.

But back upfield, the field
judge, after the ball had reached
George in the end zone, threw a
flag toward the Generals’ inter-
ior linemen. He called an inelig-
ible receiver down field penalty,
and W&L lost their six points.

From there on, the game be-
longed to the homestanding
Lynx. Southwestern took a 10-0
lead at halftime as quarterback
Mike Hanna hit Rik Talley with
a 60-yard scoring pass, and Phil
Mulkey connected on a 31-yard
field goal, as well as the extra
point.

W&L took the second half kick-
off, but could move nowhere, and
was forced to punt. Bradburn
took a low kick in full stride at
the 37-yard line, and ran right
through the W&L defenders to
the end zone. Mulkey’s kick made
it 17-0.

4-1 loss to

By SANDY BISHOP
Phi Sports Reporter

Showing little hustle and even
less offense, Washington and
Lee's soccer team fell to Gettys-
burg (Pa.) College, 4-1, Saturday,
in the Generals’ home finale for
1974.

The loss dropped W&L to 4-4-2
on the year after a 2-0 win over
Roanoke College earlier in the
week had upped the team’s re-
cord above .500 for the first time
since early in the year.

Jim Fox scored both W&L goals
against Roanoke, while goalie
Paul Devine had little trouble in
recording his second shutout of
the year. The Generals saw many
scoring chances go by as poor
shooting cost them several goals.

Against Gettysburg the Gen-
erals saw a three-game win
streak snapped as defensive let-

Harriers drop

By BRIAN HUTTON

Washington and Lee's cross-
country team finished its dual
meet season dropping a double-
dual meet to Eastern Mennonite
College, 20-36, and Madison Col-
lege, 20-29, on Saturday.

Tem Washington, led W&L
runners across the finish line,
placing sixth in a field of 27 with
a 28:24 time over the five-mile
course. Jim McMenamin was the
only other General in the top ten
runners, placing eighth with
29:05. Madison placed five run-
ners in the first ten finishers.

The losses left the cross-coun-
trymen with a 7-6 record for the
year.

Gettysburg

downs and a lack of hustle prov-
ed to be W&L’s downfall.

John Embree scored the lone
W&L goal, which at the time cut
the Gettysburg lead to 2-1. But
the visitors moved on to add
two goals late in the game.

W&L needed a win in Tues-
day’s game against VMI to keep
any chances of a winning season
alive. The Generals travel to An-
napolis, Md. on Saturday to play
nationally-ranked Navy in their
1974 season finale. The Midship-
men downed W&L last year, 3-1.

The jayvee soccer team, mean-

Believe it or not, Washington and Lee’s football team is serious
about what they do, despite what this picture might indicate.
Phi photographer Bill Robinson snapped this shot on “Hat Day”
before the Generals grabbed their first win of the season over
Sewanee. Maybe it had something to do with the outcome, as no

PKS leads

Law II

in I-M standings

By the Phi Sports Staff

After beating defending overall
champion Law II in both the
football and cross-country finals,
Phi Kappa Sigma has grabbed
the early lead in the race for the
1974-75 W&L Intramural Cham-
pionship.

PKS leads Law II by eight
points, 332-324, after four sports.
Pi Kappa Alpha is third with 314
points, followed by Sigma Alpha
Epsilon with 290, and Lambda
Chi Alpha with 258 points.

PKS grabbed the football
crown by rallying from a 6-0
halftime defecit to record a 12-6
upset win over a heavily favored

Law IJ team. Freshman Ben
Johns twice grabbed touchdown
passes for PKS, who broke the
seven year domination of the I-M
gridiron by the Law School and
Delta Tau Delta.

PKS edged Law II for the cross
country crown, 13-14. Sigma Chi
freshman Mark Hampton led the
58 runners over the 2.75 mile
“Turkey Trot” with a time of
14:09.

Led by Tom Schmutz, Law II
took the tennis title, beating Phi
Delta Theta in the finals, 3-0.

Pi Kapa Alpha won the golf
crown by edging SAE, 118 to 121,
in the medal play finals.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Generals fall, 32-0

(Continued from page 3)

On the following W&L series
Bradburn again popped up to
pick off a Berry pass, seting up
the Lynx’ third touch down,a one-
yard sneak by Hanna. The kick
failed, leaving Southwestern with
a 23-0 lead after three quarters.

The Lynx got their final nine
points within 12 seconds in the
fourth quarter. A clipping pen-
ulty on a punt gave W&L the ball
ot their own two-yard line. Three
plays later, Smith, who had re-
placed Berry at quarterback,
tried to run the ball out from the
shadows of the goalposts.

But linebacker Jon Crowder
got to Smith before he could get
out of the end zone, and the Gen-
erals for the second time on the
year were victims of a safety.

On the following free kick,
Bradburn, after taking the ball
at the 34, displayed some fine
open field running as well as some
heads-up play by using his block-
ers well to score his second touch-
down of the game. Mulkey’s kick
was good, and Southwestern had
put the game away.

W&L had a chance to score late
in the game, moving the ball to
the Lynx 8, but a blitzing Crowd-
cr threw Berry for a 13-yard loss,
taking the Generals out of scor-
ing range.

The final outcome marked the
Lirst time since the Sewanee game
of 1973 (31-0) that W&L had
gone scoreless.

The Generals will again be put
to a severe test on Saturday when
the Big Red from Denison Uni-
versity invade Lexington. Deni-
son has trounced W&L the last
two years by scores of 52-22 in

1972, and 49-29 in 1973.

Departmental grading analyzed

case, the student. It can be argu-
ed that history is downright easy,
or that politics is downright hard,
just by looking at a breakdown
of grading by department. Then
another student can come along
and say that history is hard and
politics is easy, if you take into
account such-and-such factors.

What's the easiest department

Souther, Hillman, Furay
to play WGL fall concert

by RYLAND OWEN
Phi Staff Reporter

After many weeks of searching,
Bob Morecock, Student Activi-
ties Board entertainment  co-
chairman, announced that the
SAB has contracted Asylum
recording artists, the Souther,
Hillman, Furay Band, for the
W&L fall concert.

The SHF Band will perform
Wednesday in the New Doremus
Gym and this concert will be
the group’s only Virginia per-
formance on their present tour.
Concert time is approximately
6-9 p.m.

The members of the band in-
clude: John David Souther,
writer, guitar and vocals; Chris

Stradivari

Hillman, guitar and vocals, and
Richie Furay, guitar and bass
guitar, mandolin, vocals. Along
with Souther, Hillman, Furay
are Jim Gordon, A! Perkins, and
Paul Harris, on drums, guitar
and piano respectively.

Souther, Hillman and Furay
all have an impressive back-
ground, each having been a
member of another group at
some point in the past. Furay
has played with Poco and Buf-
falo Springfield; Hillman with
the Byrds, Flying Burrito Broth-
ers, and Manassas, while Souther
has performed with Longbranch
and Pennywhistle, writing for
the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, and
Jackson Browne.

Quartet

performs tonight

The W&L Concert Guild pre-

nts its third performance this
year, with a concert by the fam-
ous Stradivari String Quartet
tonight in Lee Chapel at 8 p.m.

Their repetoire will include
Dvorak’s American Quartet,
‘artok’s String Quartet, and

Beethoven's String Quartet, Op.
. They have performed works
re Robert Stewart, W&L music
professor and director of the
culld, on national radio and in
concert. Last year, one of the
members of the quartet, violinist
Allen Ohmes, performed the
Stewart work “Duo for Violin
and Piano” in its premier per-
formance at Lee Chapel with ac-
companist James Avery.

The Quartet has played in Lex-
ington several times before. In
addition to the performance,
they will read and discuss string
quartet compositions written by
W&L students at a workshop in

Dr. Sprunt’s topic for Sun-
day's service in Lee Chapel will
be “Germs, Jesus and Santa
Claus or how do you know God
is for real.” The service begins
at 11 a.m.

the student center.

All of the members have a
fine educational background,
with their training being done at
such music schools as the East-
ern School of Music and Julliard
School of Music. Music critic,
Robert Evett calls the group
“one of the best in the world.”

The group plays with four of
the most highly prized instru-
ments in the world, a string
quartet set made by Antonio
Stradivari in the 17th and 18th
centures. The set, owned by the
Corcoran Gallery in Washington,
D.c., has been on loan to the
quartet since 1967.

The SHF Band is not a group
that can be placed in any one
category of musical style, their
music is a mixture between
country and rock. According to
“Hit Parade’ magazine, “South-
er, Hillman and Furay make
music that sounds just fine on
a fast car on a hot road day or
night ... as moody and change-
able as the summer sky.”

Tickets are $4 in advance
and $5 at the door and can
be obtained from the SAB

office in the University Center.
The SAB needs people to help
set up for the concert and all
those interested should contact
either Bob Morecock or John
Embree.

 

ROTC loses
its standard

Sometime during the morn-
ing of Sunday, Nov. 3, the
large gray and red, fringed
ROTC flag and its staff were
removed from their stand in
Evans Dining Hall.

In ail likelihood the person
or persons who removed them
considered their removal a
lark of sorts, however the
value of the flag is in excess
of $300. The ROTC depart-
ment would like to have this
flag back. The prompt return
of the flag will preclude
further or future cost and
interrogatories.

UF aids Lexington Community programs

by TOM RITTENBURG

If you are more concerned with
helping others than in receiving
help, this article is for you. The
University Federation assists in
running three community pro-
erams which help those outside
of the W&L community.

One of those programs is the
Legal Aid Society. It is run by
two students in the School of
Law, Trent Crew and Ken Harris.
They and a staff of law and
undergraduate students main-

on the staff do the actual legal
work while the others help to
keep the office open.

More difficult work and greater

honor code

By JOE FITZGERALD
Phi Staff Reporter

E.C. president Ben Bailey ap-
pointed a committee of three
Monday night to investigate stu-
dent views of the honor system
and the methods of its enforce-
ment. Bob Keatley, Sandy Stradt-
min, and Elliot Hicks were
given the job of checking out
student opinion on the subject
and reporting back at next
week's meeting.

The E.C. hopes to take some
action, if it is warranted, around
the beginning of the winter term.
In the words of E.C. member
Woody Ray. it is “time to find
out.” Ben Bailey agreed that this
is the time to do something
about the honor system if any-
thing needs to be done.

Bailey cited the importance of
looking into the matter now
when people have had time to
calm down following the latest
public trial, but before they have
completely forgotten

“We might be rushing into
something half-cocked,” said
vice-president Bob Keatley. But
the committee still felt the sub-
ject merited investigation.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK,

Reflections on the
public honor trial

The mood one perceived around the Hill during the process
of last week’s trial was, at best, pessimistic. There seemed to
be a pervading feeling that a jury trial, held before the stu-
dent body, could not achieve a dispassionate review of the
facts. Some felt that the public honor trial procedures could
stand serious revisions, Others went as far as to wish that
there be no jury trial at all, and opted for complete control of
honor violations by closed sessions of the E.C, In any case,
the mood was undeniably one of more skepticism than hope
on the prospect of a trial in which justice would be tempered
a bit too much by merey.

It is true that the rules covering the procedure of a public
honor trial are weighted heavily in favor of the defendant.
The prosecution is, in fact, rendered totally impotent under
the present system, Not only is it denied the right of “voir
dire” jury selection, but also it suffers a complete lack of
representation during the trial. Thus, the prosecution is not
on the stage to object to motions or questions of the defense,
and cannot lead the questioning of the witnesses and the
defendant himself in such a way as to make clear its allega-
tions.

Just as it would be patently unjust if there was no higher
appeal than the F.C, for an accused violator of the Honor
System, so it seems inconsistent that the E.C, is not allowed
to demonstrate, before the jury and in public, its reasons for
having convicted the man in the first place. This is not to
suggest that the E.C. enlist the support of “hired guns” from
Tucker Hall, One of the F.C, members should be perfectly
able to conduct the affairs of the case with sufficient ability.
The obvious result of this equal representation would be
a more balanced direction of the jury’s thoughts towards the
crucial points of the case.

In spite of the readily demonstrable shortcomings of the
public honor trial as it is presently conducted, there does re-
main one incontrovertably good byproduct of its existense—
it gets the campus involved in and talking about the Honor
System. One would have to have been blind and deaf not
to perceive the intense interest with which last week's trial
was received, Virtually everyone had something to say
about th trial, and no one, save the worms who rarely leave
the fifth level stacks of MeCormick Library, can now say that
he does not understand the workings and implications of the
Honor System, The public honor trial accomplishes what
it places
the Honor System in the storefront window, and makes the

no closed door session of the E.C, could hope for

knowledge of its presence an unavoidable consequence of
W&L life.
—B.S.

The student jury

We have allowed an editorial to be printed here by a mem-
ber of our staff whose opinions we felt were worthy of
being aired, His conclusion is that the Honor System and the
public honor trial are both still viable although some pro-
cedural changes need to be made.

Unfortunately we are no longer sure that we can agree with
him in his optimistic outlook. We very much hope and believe
that the honor is still important to the overwhelming majority
of students at W&L. However, we can no longer be sure that
a public honor trial by students insures in the least way that
justice will be served,

We question the premise that a group of twelve randomly
selected students has the ability or desire to pass a fair
verdict in a trial. Perhaps it is impossible at such a small
school to find twelve students who could be considered to be
an impartial jury with no direct or indirect knowledge of a
student, his associations or his character, Perhaps they are
simply unwilling to pass judgment on one of their number,
Perhaps they find the absolute penalty unacceptable,

If the student jury is to be kept then it should be composed
of students who have no knowledge of the defendant, his
associations or any other factors which might cloud their
judgment. They should believe in the Honor System and be
willing without reservation to render a verdict of guilty with
out regard to the penalty, They are only ask to determine
guilt or innocense, To do this we feel that they must believe
in the Honor System as it now stands, including the absolute

penalty,

If it is impossible to compose such a jury then the whole
left to the EC,
represent us and to willingly sit in judgment on their peers,

matter should be \iter all, we elected them to

They have proved themselves able to do this,

If some sort of appeal is absolutely necessary then take it
to the faculty or a selected portion of the faculty, If the
code cannot be effeciently run under the public jury system
something should be done to make it work or it should be
dispensed with it altogether,

Grade inflation backfires:
GPRs become less important

By PAUL LANCASTER
Managing [Editor

Editor's note—This is third in
a series of articles on grading
at Washington and Lee. This
week, Ring-tum Phi managing
editor Paul J. Lancaster presents
a look at the meaning of grade
inflation:

Ten years ago, 18 percent of
the undergraduate senior class
at Washington and Lee was
graduated with honors.

By last year, that percentage
had doubled to 36 percent of the
graduating class.

Five years ago, before the 12-
12-6 week semester system was
instituted, the combined fall and
winter term honor roll bore the
names of 232 undergraduates
(Some, of course, were named to
the honor roll in both the fall
and winter terms). Last year, the
number of names listed on the
combined fall and winter term
honor roll had increased to 430.
No honor roll is released for the
spring term.

Consequently, 667 names were
listed on the university’s combin-
ed fall and winter dean’s list five
years ago. Some 1,051 names
were on the combined dean’s list
last year.

This, despite a rise in enroll-
ment in those five years of only
about 10 percent.

As mentioned in an earlier
article in this series, the average

senior grade point ratio at Wash-
ington and Lee has increased
from 2.597 in 1967-68 to 2.761
last year,

So what?

Before attempting to answer
the above question, a few grad-
ing situations in other colleges
around the country, as noted in
this week's issue of Time maga-
zine, should be mentioned.

At Stanford University, the
average grade point ration is
3.5. There are no grades of “D”
or “F” given at Stanford. The
use of the pass-fail system is
widespread.

At Yale University, 42 percent
of the undergraduate grades
given during the school’s spring
term were grades of “A”. Slightly
less than last year’s undergradu-
ate senior class was graduated
with honors.

At American University, three-
fourths of spring terms grades
last year were grades of “A”
oo.

At the University of Pitts-
burgh, the average grade five
years ago was a “C”. It is now
as’.

Again, so what?

Some of the reasons for the
upturn in grades at Washington
and Lee and across the country
were explored in an earlier article
in this series. They will not be
repeated here.

The answer to the “so what?”

Ask Traveller

DEAR TRAVELLER--What is the Honor System?
(Signed) R.E.R. Huntley
DEAR R.E.R.—A myth, for all practical purposes. I perceive by the
tone of your inquiry that you are some neophyte freshman, and
let me assure you the Honor System became a myth long before
you ever threw up your first Evans Dining Hall chickeetti lunch
here. The Honor System disappeared because of people continu-

ally outwardly claiming its existence while denying that exist-
ence to themselves.

The Honor System as its stands today, and as it has stood
for some time, is a cross between the United Nations and Dean
John’s smile—it's always there, but you've got to wonder if it
does anything.

The Honor System does exist in structure, to be sure. The
outstanding tradition of this school has carried the Honor System
unchanged from the time of Uncle Bob Lee and his trusty steed
(who shall go unnamed here) to today. The structure exists, and
the structure is indeed appropriate for this university—if we were
back in the 1860's.

There's a problem today, though—-the structure, particularly
the idea of an absolute penalty lives on, but the mind that
formulated that structure rests only in two places on campus—-
underneath Lee Chapel, and in room 32A of Washington Hall,
where Dr. Fenwick Castledorm may be found at ease in his
rocking wheel chair, rocking contently back and forth and
asking if Sherman has reached Atlanta yet.

Elsewhere, the mind behind the Honor System has disappear-
ed, at least in reference to the absolute penalty. Indeed, a poll
conducted last year showed that some 60 percent of the student
body didn’t believe in the use of the absolute penalty—be it ex-
pulsion or a two-semester linked course with Dr. Putch, without
the benefit of a shirt and tie—as the only form of punishment
in a public honor trial. Which means if any twelve students
are selected at random from the student body, any seven will
probably be against ruling in favor of using the absolute penalty,
even if less than five of the jurors happen to belong to the
defendant's fraternity house.

So, that sums up briefly the Honor System here. W&L main-
tains pride in not delineating what constitutes an honor offense.
This is noble, yet, it, too has contributed its share to the mythi-
fication of the Honor System. There is a move to outline such
violations, It would be essentially a codification of criteria
established in previous honor trials. Among some of the possible
delineations:

~-You can plagiarize up to 43 times without having to worry
about conviction.

-~-You can lie about your age to the clerk at the ABC store.

You can permanently borrow ash trays from the library.

-—You can cheat, as long as you don't get caught.

Thus, the Honor System is still a thriving, viable entity of
the Washington and Lee community—at least it is up in Wash-
ington 32A,

inquiry may not lie within the
bounds of the universities them-
selves. The answer, instead, lies
in the realm of job- and gradu-
ate school-hunting.

The current grade inflation
may simply exlain why graduate
schools ask for criteria other
than grades when looking over
applications. Grades simply
aren't reliable. If American Uni-
versity gives out 75 percent of
its grades as grades of “A” or
“B”, to simply look at grades
would mean that a higher per-
centage of American University
students would be accepted to
graduate school than would, say,
Washington and Lee students.

Indeed, the overall inequity of
the grading system prompted
standardized tests for admission
to graduate school, and the cur-
rent trend of grade inflation is
taking more and more emphasis
away from grades and putting it
on standardized tests.

The reasoning is simple. Cer-
tainly a graduate school in law,
for example, can’t take the time
to analyze whether a Washing-
ton and Lee student’s 3.1 is bet-
ter than an American Univer-
sity student's 3.3. What if the
Washington and Lee student is
a fine arts major? That would
certainly make a difference than
if he was a major in economics
here. The same inequities by de-
partment certainly exist at other
universities, too.

The standardized test simply
places all applicants to a gradu-
ate school on more or less equal
footing. And, although there may
be certain inherent biases to-
ward some types of students in
standard tests, these biases
simply do not effect the wide
range of discrepancies among
university grading systems or,
indeed, among departmental
grading systems in a given uni-
versity.

Grade inflation, both at Wash-
ington and Lee and at colleges
across the nation, is thus fore-
ing graduate school to place less
and less importance on grades.

Everyone is gettting higher
grades, The result is that those
higher grades aren't helping the
student get into graduate school.

The same goes for students
seeking employment immediately
following graduation. Looking at
journalism for a moment, there
seems to be an increasing em-
phasis on experience. Every year,
there are four journalism gradu-
ates for each journalism job
opening. If a small percentage of
students graduated with, say, a
3.0 or above, grades will certainly
be a relatively important factor
in job-hunting. But if a large
percentage of journalism stu-
dents graduate with a 3.0 or
above, grades lose their signific-
ance.

This is what is happening, both
at Washington and Lee and at
colleges everywhere. Grades are
losing their significance, Every-
one is getting better grades, but
no one is beneliting from them.

This is, of course, an over-

Letters
To he Editor

Art in Taiwan

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

I am writing this letter in
support of the Washington and
Lee Foreign Studies program and
to express my appreciation to
Professor Ju and the university
for allowing me, a former W&L
student, to participate in the pro-
gram on Chinese Art in Taiwan
this past spring. It is only now
after some months that I can
write this letter, as the memory
of day to day inconveniences of
a first pioneering effort fade
and the lasting significance of
the experiences continues to
grow.

As far as a cultural guide, I
can think of no one more chap-
able and willing than Mr. Ju.
His information and insights in-
to China rival those of the most
prominent Chinese scholars, sev-
eral of whom we met. As hard
as it may seem, he was able to
breathe life into the museums,
adding fresh life and depth to
the ancient paintings hanging
there. I'm not trying to over-
look the hassles, the frantic pace
and rough schedule which left
me and I think everyone else,
drained, but I need to say that I
am glad that I could take part in
such a program, an important
program, and maybe the most
significant first effort of its kind.

Washington and Lee’s swim-
ming team opens its 1974-75 sea-
son Saturday in Lancaster, Pa.
as one of 16 teams in the Millers-
ville Relays.

Head Coach Bill Stearns said
the team is rounding into shape
for the upcoming dual meet sea-
son, which begins Nov. 22 against
state power Virginia Common-
wealth,

Stearns expects senior captain
Will Brotherton, junior Bill Tiers,
sophomore Tad Van Leer, and

freshman John Hudson, who has
already broken three school and
state records in practice, to be
the backbone for this year’s team.

W&L finished with a 6-3 dual
meet mark in 1973-74.

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports [editor

There’s an old football adage
which says that teams don’t win
many games without offense, and
that they lose a lot without de-
fense.

When both forces boycott a
team for sixty minutes, the end
result usually resembles Pompei
after Mount Vesuvius erupted.

Such was the case at the Colis-
seum—make that Wilson Field—
on Saturday as Washington and
Lee again played a_ lackluster
football game, falling to Denison
(O.) University, 35-6, before a
disgruntled crowd of 3,000 on
Parent’s Day.

In seeing their record slip to
1-7-1, the Generals went for the
second week in a row without a
strong offensive attack, while the
defense joined the pointgetters
on the list of the missing.

The Big Red piled up 401 yards
in the afternoon, with 300 of
them coming on the ground.
Meanwhile the Denison defense
held W&L to eight first downs
and only 172 yards on offense.

“We were controlled at the
line of scrimmage both on ot-
fense and on defense all after-
noon,” said WL head coach Bill
McHenry after the game. “What
it meant was we could not do
what we had planned, and that
we had to play catchup all game

: long?”

As costly as the lack of control
at the line was the five turn-
overs W&L suffered in the game,
the highest number of giveaways
in any 1974 game. Two of the
turnovers set up Denison touch-
downs.

The Big Red jumped out to a
7-0 lead in the first quarter,
when fullback Rich Simeone
capped an eight play, 68-yard
drive with a three-yard scoring
burst. Sieone, who in 1973 gain-
ed 250 yards against W&L, pick-
ed up 34 yards on four carries
in the first Denison scoring drive.
Jim Piper's conversion was good.

The Generals closed the gap to
7-6 on the following possession,
with the aid of the Bid Red's

lone turnover of the game. Scott
Dingler fumbled a George Makris
punt at the Denison 31, and
W&L’s Sal Abbruzzese recovered.

Two plays later, quarterback
Jack Berry found tight end Tony
Perry in the corner of the end
zone, where the sophomore All-
American candidate made a fine
grab of a 33-yard scoring pass.
W&L lined up as if they would
attempt to kick the extra point,
but again the coaches, hoping to
capitalize on what they saw in
scouting the Bid Red, tried for
the two-point conversion on a
fake.

This time, however, Denison
reacted perfectly, and Berry had
no one to throw to. A pass in-
tended for Mark George was
thrown into a crowd, and W&L
still trailed 17-6.

The Generals had a chance to
turn the game around early in
the second quarter, when Jeff
Slatcoff blocked a Denison punt,
and W&L took over at the Big
Red 18.

On first down Berry tried for
a quick touchdown by sending
running back Raynard Scott out

on a ‘swing fly” pattern. Denison
saw the play coming, and Scott
was triple-teamed in the end
zone. Dave Holcombe intercept-
ed, and the Generals had seen
their last serious threat wasted
by a turnover.

Later in the quarter, after a
Denison punt had set W&L deep
in their own territory, fullback
Mercer West fumbled, and Deni-
son’s Ken DeCrane recovered at
the Generals’ 14. Three plays
later Sieone scored his second
touchdown, this one from five
yards out. Piper’s conversion
made it 14-6.

Another W&L turnover set the
Big Red up for the third touch-
down of the first half late in
the second quarter. Perry could
not handle an overthrown pitch
from Berry on an end-around
option play, and Denison’s Den-
nis Thomas recovered at the
Generals’ 38.

The Big Red then used just
five plays to score, with Jim Bar-
rett sweeping left end for the
final seven yards. Piper’s kick
gave Denison a 21-6 halftime
led.

mM WL parents see Denison romp

Denison increased their lead
on the opening possession of the
second half. Quarterback Danny
Ross engineered a nine-play, 70-
yard drive that culminated when
he bootlegged the right side for
a three-yard touchdown. Includ-
ed in the drive were three passes
by Ross that were good for 59
yards. Piper’s kick made it 28-6.

Later in the third quarter the
Generals moved into Denison ter-
ritory but could not move and
were forced to give up the ball.
it was the only occasion that
W&L crossed the midfield stripe
in the second half.

The Big Red added their final
touchdown late in the game,
after a Makris punt took a Deni-
son bounce before being downed
at the W&L 30. Reserve quarter-
back George Powell scored on a
five-yard run with 1:28 left
Piper again converted to round
out the scoring.

Soccer ties VMI, loses to Navy

By The Phi Sports Staff

A tie and a shutout loss closed
out a dismal 1974 soccer season
for Washington and Lee last
week,

The Generals were tied by
next-door neighbor VMI, 1-1, on
Tuesday, then were shutout by
nationally ranked Navy, 4-0, at
Annapolis on Saturday.

The winless week left W&L
with a 4-5-3 season mark.

Playing without three starters
against VMI, W&L was out-
hustled and out-finessed for most
of the game. The Keydets jump-
ed to a 1-0 lead early in the
second half after a W&L de-
fensive breakdown left goalie

W&L tied the score with 20
minutes left, as Bill Cogar capi-
talized on a goalie error to score
into an open net. Several chances
late in the game went for naught,
and suddenly the Generals’ found
themselves with a giant task to
salvage a winning season.

It was a bit much to ask. W&L
found itself up against a big,
fast soccer team in the Midship-
men, who have been in the Top
20 in the nation since early in
the year.

Navy kept the pressure on

The W&L junior varsity also

lost its season finale last week,
falling to Lynchburg’s JV’s, 2-1.

Coached by law student George
Lantzas, the JV’s finished with
a 3-3-1 mark. Led by tri-cap-
tains Sandy Bishop, Plater Rob-
inson, and John Crutcher, the
future varsity Generals averag-
ed 3.7 goals per game.

Lantzas noted that while the
Wé&L JV’s were exclusively a
freshman squad, never once did
they play an all-freshman team.

A former W&L soccer player
himself. Lantzas called this year’s
freshman team “the most dedi-
cated and talented group of
freshmen to ever play soccer
here.”

“They'll be a strong basis for
the future,” Lantzas added.

Moliere play opens Monday

(Continued from page 1)
The play will be presented in
period costume, modeled after
the dress of the subjects of the
Spanish painter Velazquez. The
costumes will lend to the period
atmosphere of the play.

Gordon said he chose the play
because the title character repre-
sents a “modern existential figure
in his period.” Don Juan con-
stantly comes out of the play’s
period setting to communicate
with the 20th century audience,
Gordon explained.

“Don Juan” is today one of
the most popular of Moliere’s
works, although it was with-
drawn from the French stage
soon after it opened. Translator
Christopher Hampton explains
that “those qualities which con-
demned the play in the eyes of
Moliere’s contemporaries ... are
precisely the qualities which
commend it to modern audiences,
accustomed as they are ... to
the mixture of knockabout farce
and metaphysical speculation

ington and Lee, for instance, who
will graduate magna and summa
cum laude—will most likely be
able to rely on their grades to
take them where they want to
co. But those at Washington and
Lee with a high, but not excep-
tional, ratio simply cannot rely
on their grades to get them a
job or a place in a graduate
school,

And, of course, some colleges,

and even some departments
within some colleges, have their
reputations. Certainly many

businesses and graduate schools
rely on these reputations. The
student being graduated from
these colleges or college depart-
ments with high grades may still
be able to count on those grades
to get him where he wants to go,

That is the essential answer to
the ‘so what?” inquiry. The
question remains as to what can
be done. That question cannot
be answered within the scope of
this series of articles.

That is the situation as it cur-
rently stands. Everyone wants
higher grades to get them a job

or a position in a graduate school.
And everyone is getting those
higher grades. And, consequent-
ly, businesses and graduate
schools are placing less and less
emphasis on grades.

Perhaps, then, as grades be-
come less and less important to
businesses and graduate schools,
the rate of grade inflation may
slow and, maybe someday, stop.
Indeed, if the journalism major,
for example, puts more emphasis
into working for a newspaper as
a stringer or working on the

even be a grade recession, at
least in journalism. Experience
is more important, in this

more at getting experience than
at getting high grades; grades
consequently decline.

Then, perhaps, grading will

Following the public meetings
in the chapel the members of the
EC plan to visit the dorms and
fraternity houses in an attempt
to reach those students who do
not attend the meetings. The
members also discussed the pos-
sibility of printing a pamphlet
outlining some of the major con-
troversies surrounding the honor
system.

Vice-president Bob Keatley
said the fact sheet is “the best
way to start.’ President Ben Bai-
ley added that the purpose of the
project is to gather “constructive
criticism” of the system, not to
conduct a poll. “We're after sug-
gestions, not consensus,” he add-
ed.

Other plans include meeting
with the faculty in small groups
to talk about the instructors’
views on the honor system and
their obligation to it.

Keatley, one of three members
of a subcommittee formed last
week to draw up the format for
the planned study, said the vote

erally good.

An analysis

What does a grade mean?

By PAUL LANCASTER
Managing [ditor

Editor’s note—T his is the four-
th in a series of articles on grad-
ing at Washington and Lee. This
week, Ring-tum Phi managing
editor Paul J. Lancaster takes a
look at the university policy on
grading.

Each year, the university takes
up a block of space in its catalo-
cue in an attempt to explain
grading at Washington and Lee.
Some excerpts from that block
follow:

_—* ‘A’ (exeellent) is the mark
of highest distinction earned by
that very small proportion of stu-
dents whose work represents ap-
proximately the best that can be
expected of the man of unusual
ability.”

—* ‘B’ (good) is a mark of dis-
tinction ...”

— ‘Cc’ (satisfactory) is the
mark earned by . . . any student
of average ability and prepara-
tion who gives the course a rea-
sonable amount of time, effort,
and attention.”

“p” represents marginal work,
according to the catalogue, and
“F”, of course, “indicates un-
conditional failure.”

In addition to this general
statement on grading at Wash-
ington and Lee, the university
distributes to the faculty infor-
mation on its grading system.
The sheet reiterates what is de-
lineated in the catalogue ,and it
continues:

—‘ ‘A’ and ‘B’ are honor grades

... To merit the grade of ‘B’, the
work must show something be-
yond acquisition ... It is differ-
entiated from ‘A’ by failure to
show excellence in re-
sponse...

—'C’ is the graduation grade.
In awarding the grade of ‘C’, the
instructor should consider care-
fully the criterion set up in the
(catalogue); ... he should also
be convinced that the student is
qualified to pursue a more ad-
vanced course for which this work
is required ...

— ‘D’ grades ... must be bal-
anced by a corresponding amount
of ‘B’ work in other courses.”

From that base of university
policy on grades, professors at
Washington and Lee are sup-
posed to determine a _ grading
system which will reasonably
meet the expectations of the uni-
versity philosophy.

To mention a few points rais-
ed in previous articles:

—Nearly 60 percent of all
evades given last year were grades
of "A” ar *?’.

—More than one-third of last
year’s senior class was graduated
with a 3.0 or better.

~The average senior last year
was graduated with a 2.761. Last
year’s juniors held a 2.799 aver-
age,

The obvious implication is that
the expressed university policy on
grades and the actual grades
awarded do not correspond. “A”
is ‘the mark of highest distinc-
tion earned by that very small
proportion of students . . .” Some

Rec-tum Phi?

Gentlemen (?)

Never before have I thought
that the school newspaper de-
served the name “Ree-tum Phi”
like I did after reading the edi-
torials and “Ask Traveller” in
last week's issue (Nov. 14).

Those columns were the most
callous and libelous excuses for
journalism that I have ever seen
—and you have the self-righte-
ousness to call yourselves journa-
lists!

It is one thing to eall for re-
visions in Executive Committee
and public trial procedures and
quite another to convict men in
your paper who have been public-
ly exonerated.

To Mr. B. S. ‘who wrote the
first editorial), how can the pub-
lic trial be “weighed heavily in
favor of the defendant” when the
jury knows the defendant has al-
ready been convicted by the E.C.?
Doesn't it seem that the defense
has to prove his innocence in-
stead of being proved guilty as it
should be? Does the defense have
any greater right to “voir dire”
than the prosecution? Lastly, you
should ask yourself what you
want out of the public trial. It
seems, Mr. B, S., that all you
what is a ratification of the E.C.’s
decision by a public trial.

To Mr. J.L.R.. no jury every
convened is asked to “determine
euilt or innocence” of a defend-
ant. If a jury conviets it shows
they felt Unere was enough evi-
dence to indicate the defendant's
guilt. If a jury acquits they have,
in essence, determined there was
not enough evidence to indicate
the defendant's guilt “beyond a
reasonable doubt.” Mr. J. L. R.,
do you really believe the E. C.
eenerally has less knowledge of
a defendant than twelve ran-
domly picked students do? I
hardly think so. it is their job
to know people in order to get
elected.

Least of all do I believe any one
eroup, such as the E, C., should
be given first and at the same
time last word on whether a stu-
dent stays or is foreed to leave
WAaL.

The “Ask Traveller’ column
was a sham of good journalistic
ethics, to make a mild under-
statement. Your premeditated
«presumed? misuse fraud in us-
ine the university president's
name for such serious matters
constitutes libel. The delineations
which concluded the column
seem unethical, at the least, in
lHeht of what has happened.

Finally, I fear the day that the
E.C., or for that matter, the edi-
corial staff of the Rec-tum Phi,
becomes the final determinant

for a person's stay at W&L, Maybe
the editorial staff and the E. C.
should consider as many of the
facts as the twelve men on the
jury did. Personally, I would
rather have a dishonorable man
allowed to stay at W&L than an
honorable man be forced to leave.

Class of 1976

Student jury:
not at fault

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I wish to respond to your edi-
torial column in last week's issue.
I think that what filled that space
was a fairly accurate representa-
tion of the prevalant opinion of
the University community — cer-
tainly of the students. That is
what disturbs me most.

There seems to be emerging
from the verdicts of the past
three public honor trials a gen-
eral naive belief in the finality of
the E.C.’s convictions. This is
very dangerous to the Honor
System because each time some-
one who has been found guilty by
the E.C. brings his case into pub-
lic light to the student body, the
eeneral feeling seems to be that
he's automatically a dead man.
Then, when and if the student
jury lets him off, the student
community is thrown into great
dismay over whether the Honor
System is effective.

Perhaps the explanation for
this dismay lies in the past three
verdicts of innocence in the past
three public honor trials. Would
the students have more confi-
dence if “justice” were reinforced
by a guilty verdict being inter-
posed every other time or so?
Would the Honor System then be
effective?

The only way the Honor Sys-
tem will work is if the grotesque
assumption that the defendant
should be convicted is overcome.
It is almost as if the students
need to witness periodical pub-
lie verdicts to feel they live in a
community where justice reigns.
In that case we're long overdue
for such a verdict, and I fear for
the fate of the next public Honor
Trial defendant.

I think you're suggestion that
perhaps the public trial proce-
dure be done away with is most
dangerous, for that would almost
totally exclude the students at
large from being involved in the
procedure, Your argument that
the E.C. is after all our elected
officials is most absurd, Student
elections are highly ceremonial
procedures since few have any
idea of whom they vote for. I
agree that the student jury must
be impartial and respect the
lionor System. But as soon as the

22.6 percent of all grades award-
ed last year were grades of ‘A’”’.
That does not seem to be a “very
small proportion of students.”

Consequently, nearly 60 per-
cent of all marks awarded last
year were marks of “distinction,”
as described by grades of “A” or
“B”. To be among the 40 percent
would be more ‘‘distinet.”

“C” is described as average.
Yet the 2.0 numerical equivalent
of a “C” average is some .761
points lower than the average of
last year’s senior class.

And, according to the defini-
tion of the catalogue, about 10
percent of all grades given last
year were given to “marginal”
students and “unconditional fail-
ures.”

“The faculty is simply not fol-
lowing these standards,” says one
Washington and Lee professor.
“The faculty grading informa-
tion sheet and the catalogue
written together are superb in
describing ways in which a stu-
dent may excel. The present prac-
tice of Washington and Lee for
the most part does not confirm
with these standards.

“Does the professor ignore the
need for uniformity in university
grading,’ he continues, “or does
he ignore these admirable stand-
ards?"’ The professor says that
faculty members who want to
conform to these standards and
who additionally want to bring
uniformity to the Washington
and Lee grading system are “in a
bind.”

A self-righteous EC

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I was very disapointed when I
read your editorial on the public
jury in last week's issue. It seems
to me that to blame the public
jury for all the ills in the Honor
System was simplistic at best.

I can agree with your state-
ment that the public jury’s only
duty is to pass judgment on the
cefendant and not upon the abso-
lute penalty. Besides that I must
violently disagree with your every
assumption. It is my belief that it
has been the public jury which
has preserved the integrity of the
Honor System. The only mistake
I have seen a public jury make
was last spring when the jury
admitted that the Honor Code
had been broken but questioned
the defendant's intent. On the
other hand, every other public
trial has demonstrated that the
E.C. is far from infallible. I was
very unhappy to see people will-
ine to convict the defendant in
the most recent trial on the basis
of circumstantial evidence alone.
If only circumstantial evidence
were required for conviction, an
earnest prosecutor could expel
half the school,

I will admit that the public
jury has its faults, but not as
many as the E.C. trial. To the un-
initiated subject of the W&L
Honor Code, the E.C. trial sounds
like a Hollywood version of the
Inquisition but tis serious in its
results. The defendant is kept in
a small room for hours, unable to
hear the testimony against him,
and can be convicted on purely
speculative evidence. The whole
thing is done in secret so as to
protect your reputation, but also
to protect the misplaced public
confidence in the E.C.

It would appear that the E.C.
members have taken their role too
seriously and are becoming too
self-righteous for the public good.
I ‘not being an editor, I cannot
use the royal “we'') question the
premise that a group of twelve
elected students has the ability or
desire te pass a fair verdict in a
secret trial. Is the E.C. so much
more divine than the student
body that it can act fairly and
with justice while twelve mem-
bers of the student body cannot.
I seriously question the editor's
rational instating that the E.C.
has proved itself able to sit in fair
judgment,

Perhaps the better system lies
somewhere in between. Perhaps a
randomly selected jury (with a

Capturing marvelously the suc-
cinct and incisive qualities of
Moliere’s wit, Christopher Hamp-
ton’s translation of Don Juan en-
joyed a rollicking success on its
opening at the University Theat-
re, The wryness of French hu-
mor, which is so often lost in
translation, was there in all its
potency, and Brock Johnson, as
Don Juan, brought it to life.

While portraying a character
who is written to be devilishly
captivating, Mr. Johnson took
matters a step further and made
him intimately so. Utilizing the
smallness of the Troub Theatre
(for once, to a good end), he ad-
dresses his opening remarks con-
cerning his passion for feminine
conquest not only to his perpetu-
ally befuddled valet, Sganarelle
(John Hargrove) and Elvira’s
buffoon-like squire, Guzman
(Brian Garr), but also to various
women in the audience with
whom he establishes direct and
titillating eye contact.

While Don Juan is seducing,
talking about seducing, rebuking
God, etc., Sganarelle is there like
a shadow. A crucial character in
the play, Sganarelle is the “re-
actor’, the foil to Don Juan.
John Hargrove, who has worked
long and hard with the theatre
without landing a major role,
took the character of Sganarelle
and gave him a delightful ef-
fervescence and _ impishness,
while preserving his disbelieving
awe of Don Juan’s callousness.

better touch on the reality of the
Honor Code) conducting a trial
in seeret; or the E.C. conducting
a trial in public; would be better.
But then the defendant may lose
his right to appeal. All I know is
that the present system of justice
here has failed to act with jus-
tice or dispatch, and that your
(the editor's) solution is sheer
folly.

Thomas Rittenburg ‘75

In the EC’s defense

Mr. Rittenburg:

We appreciate your comments,
or at least the fact that you took
the time to seribble them down,
but we find your less than flatter-
ing portrayal of the EC to be
specious at best.

We think it is unfair for you to
accuse the EC of being self-right-
eous. The members of that body
are only attempting to fulfill the
duties of the offices to which
they were elected by the major-
ity vote of your peers. Trials are
held in closed session to protect
the accused and for that reason
alone — not so the EC can pro-
tect its own reputation,

You question whether that
group of students have the abil-
itu and desire to pass a fair ver-
dict in a secret trial. It would ap-
pear obvious that the student
body believes that their elected
representatives have such ability
or they would not have elected
them. Likewise, one must assume
that they have the desire to serve
their peer group in this way or
they would not have taken the
job upon themselves.

We have no magical answers to
the problems that have recently
arisen in connection with the
Honor System. The EC has begun
to examine the situation and we
have faith in its ability to con-
duct an investigative study which
will prove profitable for both the
school and the Honor Code.

Politics—
why are grades
always so low?

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
With reference to the break-
down of department grades in
last week's “Phi”, an explicative
theory concerning the compara-
tively low grades in politics seems
appropriate. As a senior politics
major I am neither bitter nor sur-
prised that my chances of mak-
ing a “C” in polities are four

“Don Juan”

Miss Parker renders Charlotte
as a Pygmalion-like character
who, despite her horridly unlady-
like laugh, provides no small at-
traction for Don Juan. Her erst-
while fiance Pierrot (Jeff Bird)
comes to defend his claim but is
summarily disposed of. Unfor-
tunately, Mr, Bird indulges in a
bit too much slap-stick in his
scuffling with Don Juan and the
humor of the scene comes off a
bit heavy-handed. The same ob-
jection can be made of Marthu-
rine (Suzanne Carr) in her later
row with Charlotte. Moliere sub-
tlety simply does net warrent
such extreme antics despite the
fact that his genre here is the
farce.

A puzzling but largely success-
ful aspect of Mr. Gordon’s cast-
ing was his use of double and
triple roles. Both Paul Thomp-
son and Hugh Sisson played two
roles, and Brian Garr played
three. While greater crispness of
character might have been a-
chieved through individual ac-

tors playing individual roles, all
three of the gentlemen turned in
good performances. Mr. Thomp-
son, in his first major appear-
ance on stage deserves special
mention for his portrayal of the
diaphanous Doctor Marphurius
and the doughty Don Louis, fath-
er of Don Juan,

As a counterpoint to the pro-
fusion of fools, buffoons and
rakes who populate the stage
throughout the play, Don Juan’s
wife, Elvira (Terry Burtyk) is
virtually the only sombre pre-
sence. Miss Burtyk’s high seri-
ousness is well contrasted with
Mr. DeChristopher’s rendition of
her whimpy brother whose mis-
fortune it is to have to defend her
on the field of honor .

In general, the performance
exuded a carnival-like atmos-
phere, right down to the music
which accompanied it. Moliere is
portraying a topsy-turvy world
in Don Juan and with a stacatto-
like pace, the University Players
give us just that.

times greater than making an
“A” or that my odds of making
an “A” in the fine arts are four
times greater than in politics. I
am only interested in knowing
why this is the case.

Whereas the preponderant
practice in most of the other de-
partments is to grade numeri-
cally, almost all grades given in
politics during the course of a
semester constitute letter evalua-
tions. This is not to say one is
right and the other wrong. It’s
just to say that the very nature
of political science clearly neces-
sitates letter grades and the
vague connotations professors
give them.

In a department where there
are no right or wrong answers it
becomes very difficult to judge
any student's performance as be-
ing excellent ‘(‘A”), because
everything taught in polities is
criticized. Moreover, whereas in
most other departments one's
amount of work can be correlat-
ed to his grade ‘hard work -
high grade), digestion and regur-
gitation or pertinent facts does
not work well in polities courses,
dike it does in science or history,
for example).

Thus, the politics student soon
becomes accustomed to being
pleased upon receiving from his
professor a “Good Job! — C”.

Comments on
Phi’s content

I would like to take this op-
portunity to congratulate man-
aging editor Paul Lancaster on
his fine series of articles concern-
ing erade inflation at Washing-
ton and Lee. This type of report-
ing has long been missing from
The Ring-tum Phi while there is
a definite need for it. These ar-
ticles exposed the average stu-
dent to information to which he
normally would not have been
exposed. I encourage Lancaster
and other Phi reporters to con-
tinue with similar studies of re-
levant topics, Some areas which
might be examined include ex-
penditures of the SAB, functions
of various faculty and student

committees and the
system.

In addition to the above com-
ments, I would like to express my
pleasure at what seems to be a
turn for the better on your part.
Although I may not agree with
the comments expressed therein,
your editorial of last week seems
to indicate that you have finally
decided to address yourself to
serious matters. I hope that you
will continue to do so and that
you will leave the satire to Tra-
veller .

fraternity

Stephen Q. Giblin "77
Mr. Giblin:
in response to your hopes for
the future of the editorial col-
umn, 1 must admit that last week
was only a@ momentary lapse.
With hard work and a stiff up-
per lip we may be able to avoid
addressing ourselves to “serious
matters” or serious people in the
near future.
J LAR,

Letters to the editor are always
welcome provided they are coher-
ent and in good taste. Those who
wish to submit letters should
have them in The Ring-tum Phi

Roundballersseek
Sth winner in row

by BILL FLESHER

The cover of the new Wash-
ington and Lee basketball re-
cruiting brochure sports a picture
of Skip Lichtfuss laying in two of
his 1561 career points along with
an exclamation, ‘“W&L Basket-
ball—WHERE WINNING IS A
TRADITION.”

Now the tradition must be con-
tinued without W&L’s fifth all-
time leading scorer, who will play
in Doremus Gym only in future
alumni games.

jut the idea of playing with-
out Lichtfuss and his scoring
ability hasn't crossed Verne Can-
field’s mind.

“To win you have to think
positively,” said the Generals’
head coach, with whom positive
thoughts have become routine
after seven straight winning sea-
sons and a 146-96 career mark in
ten years at W&L.

“To blame our loss of Skip
would be an excuse. What we
have to do is get more scoring
from each position, which we can
do because of what I feel is better
overall balance at each spot,”
Canfield added.

With eight of last season’s ten
regulars returning, plus what
Canfield calis ‘‘a versatility we’ve
never had both on offense and on
defense,” picking up the scoring
punch left by Lichtfuss’ gradua-
tion should not be difficult.

Leading the returnees from
last year’s 13-12 squad are senior
co-captains Guy Kerr and Greg
Groghan, along with senior Bo
Williams and juniors Norm Kris-
toff, Gary Fitzgerald, John Pod-
gajny, Jeff Baum, and Paul Ma-
loney.

Kerr (6'4") and Croghan (6'3’’)
should anchor the forward spots,
with Fitzgerald (6'5") and Baum
(6'4") seeing considerable action
off the bench. In 1973-74, the
forwards garnered an average of
22 points and 17 rebounds a

game.

Canfield will look to Williams
and Podgajny (both 673”)
to hold down the shooting guard
spot, from which 31 points per
game came in 1973-74.

Both compliment each other
well, with Williams an often
deadly shooter from the out-
side, while Podgajny is an ag-
gressive, constantly hustling
player who also has a fine touch
from the middle range. Maloney
returns to occupy the _ point
guard spot along with sophomore
Kim Sims, who moved up to the
varsity late last season. Both are
5'11”, both attended the same
high school (Georgetown Prep,
outside Washington), and are
fine playmakers who can also
handle their own shooting the
Dall.

The lone question mark is at
center, and the puzzle there in-
volves health and not talent.
Kristoff (6’9") proved last sea-
son that he could handle most
everyone he faced, scoring 12
points while adding 11 rebounds
per outing. However, he missed a
good part of the year due to an-
kle injuries, which have plagued
him throughout his career.

Canfield says that this problem
will mean limited duty for Kris-
toff in the early going, until the
center is ready to go full tilt.

WésL 2nd in swim meet

Led by freshman John Hudson,
Washington and Lee's swimming
team placed second to Blooms-
burg State (Pa.) College in the

Millersville Relays Saturday in
Lancaster, Pa.

Swiming in his hometown,
Hudson led W&L to victories and
meet records in three events, the
400- and 800-yard freestyle re-
lays and the crescendo relay.

I-M swim

Freshman Mark Hampton led
EX with wins in the 100-yard in-
dividual medley, the 100-yard
butterfly, and a leg in the win-
ning 200-yard medley relay.

EX also got wins from Hunter
Charbonnet in diving and from
its 200-yard freestyle relay.

Law I's Ralph Lyons scored a
double in the 100- and 200-yard
freestyles.

The 800-yard freestyle relay,
consisting of Hudson, Tad Van
Leer, Will Brotherton, and Rob-
bie Searles, qualified for the Di-
vision III national meet with a
7:39.0 time.

Gary Seldomridge joined Hud-
son, Van Leer, and Brotherton on
the winning 400-yard relay team,
3:25.0.

Hudson, Brotherton, Seldom-
ridge, Searles, Alan Pettigrew,
David Winge, and Peter Meem
made up the winning crescendo
relay, an event in which all four
strokes were swum,

Hudson's 500-yard freestyle leg
of 4:46.5 would have placed se-
cond in last year's national meet.

W&L opens its 1974 dual meet
season tomorrow at 7 p.m. against
state power Virginia Common-
wealth. Saturday the Generals
host Madison at 2 p.m.

Both meets will be in the new
pool.

Generals
‘miss’ in

74 finale

by BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s disap-
pointment-filled football season
ended in heartbreak Saturday
when a 32-yard field goal at-
tempt by freshman Phil Bailey
with five seconds left failed, giv-
ing Washington (Mo.) Univer-
sity’s Bears a 10-8 win before a
Sparse gathering at Wilson
Field.

The Generals, who closed the
year with a 1-8-1 mark, had set
up the field-goal attempt with a
drive from their own 33 to the
Bears’ 15 in the final two min-
utes. After the teams exchanged
penalties, Bailey, who had never
tried a placement in a game be-
fore, left his kick short and to
the left.

Earlier Bailey had missed a 37-
yard attempt.

It was a field goal that even-
tually made the difference in the
final outcome. Washington’s Ken
King made a 37-yarder in the se-
cond quarter, which at the time
gave the Bears a 3-0 lead.

Washington upped their lead
to 10-0 four plays into the fourth
quarter when quarterback Mike
Karaffa scored on a nine-yard
run. King added the conversion.

The Generals narrowed the
gap with 6:41 remaining when
freshman running back Raynard
Scott flared out of the backfield
grabbed a pass from quarterback
Jack Berry, and sped up the side-
line 61 yards for a touchdown. A
two-point conversion pass from
Berry to John Moore narrowed
the gap to 10-8.

W&L got the ball back on the
ensuing kickoff. Bailey tried an
onside kick, which hit at the
Generals’ 45 and then bounced
. . . backwards. A Washington
player tried to fal lon the ball
but couldn't hold on, and Charlie
Brown recovered at the W&L 39.

Four plays later the Generals

Meaningful grades?

(Continued from Page 2)

'vhe faculty brought up the dis-
cussion of grades at a meeting
earlier this year, as the Courses
and Degrees Committee hoped to
alleviate the problems inherent
in this schism between university
policy and practice. The discus-
sion was tabled; no further ac-
tion has been taken.

Thus, the university policy ex-
ists, and the university practice
exists, but the two are not living
in peaceful co-existence. Simple
as that. Yet ,the university, the
faculty, or the students them-
selves have not taken a serious
iook of late into the anomoly be-
tween preaching and practicing.
individual professors are fighting
between adherence to university
policy or adherence to university-
wide uniformity. And, as a result,
neither is being achieved.

Next issue—A look at options
to the grading system at Wash-
ington and Lee.

When Kristoff is rested, cither
Fitzgerald or sophomores Don
Berlin (6’8”) or Steve Hand (6’-

6") will fill the post.

Again Canfield plans to have
a special “Aggressors” squad to
be used in pressing situations.
Baum, Hand, Sims, Steve Out-
law, and Chris Larson make up
the unit which Canfield hopes
“will give our regulars a rest and
hopefully shake things up a bit
on the court,”

W&L has a 26-game schedule,
which features battles against
University Division teams Vir-
ginia (at Charlottesville on Dec.
2) and Navy, and college division
powers Roanoke, Old Dominion,
Madison, Baltimore University,
and Randolph-Macon.

“Tt’s a schedule which means
that each player has to play up
to his ability and then some,”
Canfield said. ‘We can do this;
we have shown it in practice. The
question is, can we find that little
bit extra when we have to?”

All the questions will be an-
swered soon, beginning with a
Tip-off Tournament in Doremus
Gym a week from tomorrow
against Maryville College. Hamp-
den-Sydney hosts Frostburg

Fancy Dress not to be effected

SAB loses $5000 on SHF concert

By STEVE YEVICH

The Student Activities Board
lost about $5000 on the Souther-
Hillman-Furay concert in the
New Doremus Gym on November
20th.

Exact figures have not yet
been compiled, but it was esti-
mated by the SAB that about
500 people attended the concert,
accounting for roughly $2000 in
ticket sales.

Volume LXXIV

Total expenses incurred in
bringing the band to Lexington
amounted to $7100, according to
John Killpack, Chairman of the
SAB. Thus his committee had to
spend about $5000 out of its own
budget for the concert.

While the loss was substantial,
the activities board had appropri-
ated $7500 in its budget to cover
the anticipated deficit for the fall
concert. Total losses on all activi-

ties this year have been $6500,
including the $5000, so the SAB
has a surplus of $1000 at the
moment.

The rumors that the Fancy
Dress budget will be cut to cover
the costs of the November con-
cert are unsubstantiated, said
Killpack. The SAB knew it would
lose money on the concert and
planned its budget accordingly.
However, if there had been bet-
ter atendance, extra money would

have been made available to
spend on Fancy Dress.

Killpack said that the SAB is
caught in a painful dilemma re-
garding concerts: bands cannot
be brought on weekends, as a
rule, because of the high costs
involved, and yet weekend at-
tendance would be good. On the
other hand, weeknight costs are
lower, but students cannot seem
to afford the time, as shown by
the recent concert.

iy the Phi News Staff

Three VMI students escaped
death Sunday when they missed
the Trans-World Airlines flight
514 that crashed outside Wash-
ington, aecording to Mrs. Julia
Martin of the VMI Public In-
formation Office.

Mrs. Martin said two students,
including John Willison of the
VMI footbal squad, cancelled
their reservations on the flight
Sunday morning when they
found a ride to Lexington with
another eadet from Ohio.

The third cadet, John Lach of
Palmer, Ohio, was a stand-by
passenger who was “bumped”
from the flight shortly before
takeoff.

All 92 persons on board the
‘TWA flight died when the plane
went down at Upperville, Va., 20
miles from Dulles Airport, due to
bad weather.

NOTICE
Dr. James G. Leyburn will
be speaking in Lee Chapel
this Sunday as part of the
weekly worship service. His
topic is “What is that in
your hand?” The service be-

eins at 11:00 a.m.

came effective this past Novem-
ber 19.

The new amendment, discuss-
ed at great lengths in the past
faculty meeting, provides the
student with access to any rec-
ords concerning him and forbids
schools to release any informa-
tion on the student to anyone
but himself, except with the stu-
dent’s permission (‘i.e., grades
must be sent to students instead
of parents.)

In addition, when requested,

the college has 45 days to re-
lease to a student his records.
President Robert E. R. Huntley
announced that W&L will re-
spond to students’ requests on a
case by case basis. Furthermore,
all high school recommendations
will be destroyed following ad-
mission decisions on perspective
students.

The Education lobby, however,
led by institutions with which
W&L is affiliated, has been at-
tempting to put through an

amendment that will exclude the
letters of recommendations.

President Huntley also pointed
out that parents of W&L stu-
dents will be sent a letter in-
forming them that federal law
will not allow the school to send
them grades. A form will be en-
closed, nonetheless, so that the
student may allow his grades to
be sent to his parents. He has
also noted that the school will
take no position on professor and
grade recommendations.

Yes, Virginia, the Wé&L faculty

is good for something else

Although some might think
that the faculty at Washington
and Lee does nothing at ali
except go to cocktail parties and
attend a few of their own classes,
there a few notable exceptions.
The accomplishments of Doctors
DeVogt and Phillips of eco-
nomics and Stuart of the English
department have shown that they
ean display their intellectual
prowess off the campus as well
as on.

John F. DeVogt, head of the
administration department, is
the new president of the South-
ern Managment Associaiton. Dr.
DeVoget was installed in his new
post in the third week in No-
vember at the association’s an-
nual meeting in Atlanta, Ga.

A W&L professor of economics.
Dr. Charles F. Phillips Jr., was
a panel leader in seminars on
regulated utilities in California
and Indiana last month. At the
three-day seminar on utility fi-

nance and economics in Los
Angeles Dr. Phillips was joined
by such notable figures as Herb-
ert Stein, former chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisors,
and Lindsey Clark, economic
news editor of the Wall Street
Journal. Dr. Phillips is also the
author of two books: Economics
of Regulation and Competition in
the Domestic Telecommunica-
tions Industry.

Two collections of poems by
Dabney Stuart of the English
department have just been pub-
lished. One is The Other Hand,
published by Louisiana State Uni-
versity Press. The other is a col-
lection of poems for children
entitled Friends of Yours,
Friends of Mine, published by
Rainmaker Press of Richmond.
The new volumes are the third
and fourth collections of Stuart's
poetry to be published. His earlier
volumes are Diving Bell and A
Particular Place.

The campaign will include

ployees, reduce the number of
alads served at lunch, and end
the nonexistent senior “privilege”
of teking more than one dessert.

Mr. Darrell feels that the pro-
ram will “sell itself’ and has

mifidence in the students’ abil-
ity to cope with the problem
At present the menu planning is

wish te change it. But the only

pinch of a Ueht money supply
What is being offered in this

food ecology campaign is an op-
portunity for the individual stu-
dent to help in reducing the
burdens placed by the atlling
economy upon himeecl!

If students would only realize
this and support the weeknight
concerts, Killpack said, more and
better bands could be attracted.

Another problem confronting
the SAB in scheduling concerts is
the fact that most bands are
seeking exposure more than the
money. And so W&L faces the
problem of having groups like
the Beach Boys shunning Lex-
ington for larger audiences. Kill-
pack said that his committee

could afford one or more “big-
name” concerts a year, but it is
hard to convince the “big-names”
to play in this part of the Valley
because of the small size of
W&L.

Killpack denied the rumor that
there was a private party after
the concert paid for with pro-
ceeds from ticket sales: ‘We
{members of SAB] stayed around
and cleaned up until 1:30 a.m.,
if you call that a party.”

IRS assesses frat
for lack of form

By DAVID LOTTS
Special to the Phi

The Internal Revenue Service
has imposed a $570 penalty on
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity for
not filing a tax exempt status
form within the required period,
according to Mrs. Mary Lowuery.
auditor of the Interfraternity
Council.

The fraternity, which is ex-
empted from paying income tax.
was required to send tax exempt
status form 990 to the IRS in
Philadelphia no later than Janu-
ary 31, 1974, said Mrs. Lowuery
She added that she had pre-
pared and given the form to last
year's treasurer on Nov. 3, 1973,
but that the IRS did not receive
the form until March 30. 1974
“The treasurer must have been
rummaging through a box in
March, found it and mailed it in
late.” she said.

Cari W. Schell. group manage!

failure to complete the exemp-

tion form results in a $10 a day
fine for each day the form is
late, with a maximum fine of
$5.000. Schell added that the
penalties are lifted if the organi-
zation can give a valid reason for
not sending the form within the
required period.

Ben Sherman, co-chairman of

could have recently been fined
up to $1,200. but that the IRS
had abated that penalty,

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

Preserving the
Honor System

The honor trial which came earlier in the fall initiated
discussion on the procedures and effectiveness of the Honor
Code. Appropriate reforms are now being sought by the Stu-
dent Executive Committee to make the System fairer and
more equitable for both the student body and the accused,

The discussion which was aroused has proved profitable
for all of us. The fact that students are showing their interest
and willingness to express their views on the subject is cer-
tainly gratifying for those of us who feel that the Honor
System is an integral part of life at Washington and Lee.

While the spirit moves us we would like to issue a note of
caution. Nothing can be 100 per cent perfect. That which is
predominantly good should be preserved in lieu of adopting
another from which may well prove to be worse than that
which it replaces. Although some imbalances in the Honor
System became apparent in the course of the last public trial
and should be corrected, the Honor System is basically
sound-—theoretically.

Immediately after the last trial we raised the question of
whether the student jury was capable of standing as the
sentinel of the Honor System. We are still quite far from being
convinced that the public jury is a good thing. On the other
hand, it should be preserved until the students lose confidence
in it as an institution, It appears to us at this point that the
majority of the student body maintains that he public jury
is valuable. That being the case, we would expect that it will
remain and, hopefully, live to see better days ahead.

The Honor System owes its whole existance to the belief
of the student body that it is a necessary and integral part of
life at Washington and Lee. It relies on our faith in it and
thus cannot be regarded as other institutions. We insert this
to explain that although we do not find aspects of it accept-
able we feel that as long as any part of it is supported by
the student body it should be kept. The Honor System is not
really a practical or realistic institution—it is idealistic and
should be treated as such.

Another part of the Honor Code which we hope will not
be compromised is the idea of the absolute penalty. As has
been said before, cither a person is honest or dishonest—there
is no such thing as being a little bit dishonest. To suggest that
the absolute penalty be replaced by a graduated penalty sys-
tem is comparable to suggesting that Pandora open her box
just a little: impossible. If we are to have an Honor Code
it must be based on the understanding that the students want
to live in an environment in which they can safely assume
that their peers are honest, not somewhat honest, which implies
the rational for the absolute penalty.

Outrage

Upon returning from Thanksgiving vacation most people
realized, if they had not done so already, that exams were
only days away. Thus the Great Cram began with the influx
of students last Sunday.

—J.L.R.

For many, last Sunday was a day of feverish activity if
not one of horrifying frustration with the prospects of be-
ginning courses one week before exams. As if this were not
bad enough, insult was added to injury by the fact that the
Co-op failed to open at the appointed hour, ie., 7:30 p.in,
The reaction of many students to this gross injustice was
one of moral outrage.

Perhaps the failure of the Co-op to open was a result of
a conspiracy on the part of professors to bring grade inflation
to a grinding halt by frustrating the students to death. At
any rate, such an occurance brings to mind the worst excesses
of the French Revolution and should not become a frequently
utilized form of harassment,

An analysis

By PAUL LANCASTER
Phi Managing [Editor

Editor’s note—This is the fifth
and last of a series of articles on
grading at Washington and Lee.
This week, Ring-tum Phi man-
aging editor Paul J. Lancaster
wraps up his look on grading,
with a look at an alternative to
Washington and Lee’s current
grading system,

. a oo

Grades are up. Graduate
schools simply cannot take a
fair look at a person’s grades and
determine if that person should
be admitted. One man’s 3.0 is
superior in one school; it’s aver-
age in another. One man’s 3.0 is
superior in one department at
Washington and Lee; it’s aver-
age in another.

Grades have long been regard-
ed as one of the best gauges of
how a student will perform in
post-graduate employment or
studies. For years, many gradu-
ate schools could trust that a 3.0
meant the student was doing
superior work in college. But no
more.

To mention a few statistics to
back this contention: the aver-
age mark at Stanford is a 3.5;
the nationwide grade point ratio
has risen by more than .4 in the
last 10 years; more than one-

third of the senior undergradu-
ate class at Washington and Lee
will be graduated next May with
honors. How can a graduate
school put as much an emphasis
on grades as it did in the past?

So the graduate school looks
to other criteria with which he
can judge a student’s abilities.
First, there are faculty recom-
mendations. But to be a little
more accurate, there were fac-
ulty recommendations.

Many graduate schools will
no longer accept recommenda-
tions from a student’s college
professors. The reason? A bill
enacted in Congress recently
enables a student to examine all
data on the student which is
held by the school. Thus con-
fidential letters of recommenda-
tion are no longer confidential
and professors are reluctant to
write letters which may be seen
by the student. All recommenda-
tions that are written may soon
be good recommendations, and
the value of this as a gauge for
student ability will be lost.

Then there are the scores of
standardized tests. As treacher-
ous as the thought might be to
some students, the prospect is
for increasing emphasis on stand-
ardized tests as a gauge of stu-
dent ability. It is certainly uni-

form, unlike grades; there are
no student-faculty politics in-
volved, unlike letters of recom-
mendations.

There is a fourth criterion
here, one that has been almost
totally ignored by graduate
schools and employers, and one
that indeed could serve as an
alternative to, or a complement
of, grading. That criterion is class
rank.

Indeed, class rank is currently
a major criterion of undergradu-
ate schools in considering appli-
cants from high schools. Like-
wise, graduate schools could see
the student’s grade point ratio in
the meaningful context of class
rank. Certainly, a student rank-
ing fifth in his class with a 3.45
has achieved more than a student
who is ranked 45th in a class the
same size and who carries a 3.5.

Class rank would at least begin
to lessen the differences among
the grading systems of different
schools. But what about differ-
ences among the grading systems
of various departments? All else
being equal, any given student
majoring in fine arts has a com-
paratively better chance of be-
ing graduated among the top
10—or even the top 100—than
does the politics major at Wash-
ington and Lee. How is such

Letters to the editor...

Over-reacting

Recent remarks by General
Brown and Secretary Butz have
been termed as unfortunate and
even racist by various columnists
in the national news media. Gen-
eral Brown spoke of the Jewish
influence in America and Con-
gress, saying that it is too power-
ful. Secretary Butz, in a mock
Italian accent, critized Pope
Paul's stand on birth control in
underdeveloped nations. Admit-
tedly their comments were not
overly tactful considering their
high government posts. However,
the real unfortunate occurance
is the over-reaction of the press
and the American people.

There has been a similar situa-
tion at W&L this year. A group
of members of SABU (‘Student
Association for Black Unity)
visited the residence of the
writer of “Ask Traveller” de-
manding an explanation of his
remarks on the social life of
black students at W&L. Within
the context of the article the re-
marks about their serving mint
puleps were obviously meant in a
humorous manner, not to be
taken seriously. A public apology
from “Traveller” appeared in the
next issue of the Phi.

It is a sad situation indeed
when in our country today a
religious or ethnic group reacts
to comments or jokes of these

sorts in such a defensive man-
ner. A harmless quip about an
ethnic minority is viewed as be-
ing racist or even anti-American.
On the other hand a biting slur
or a cynical denunciation direct-
ed towards white middle-class
Americans is deemed perfectly
acceptable, if not in vogue. I feel
there is something very wrong
with this vast discrepancy in
attitudes.

Student finds
Honor System weak

I know I am going to hell when
I die, so I have no reservations
when I say, “I'll be damned if
any student in the University will
swear he has not committed an
honor violation.” Take to heart
two, of many, examples; lieing to
buy liquor or stealing athletic
equipment.

I for one will admit to having
committed honor violations. And
thought I don’t relish the thought
of being kicked out of W&L for
these acts, I must say that if
I am not kicked out of W&L
then the Honor Code is dead or
at least dormant.

I write this letter regretfully
because I wish the honor system
could only operate as simply as
its ideals are stated. We are all
human and the Honor System is

Reading skills program offered

As a service to students, the
University has once again this
year engaged Baldridge Reading
and Study Skills, Inc. to offer
on campus a special program de-
signed to improve reading and
learning skills in academic sub-
jects.

This program will be con-
ducted on the Washington and
Lee campus by an instructor
from Baldridge Reading from
January 13 through February 7.
Scheduling will be flexible to
accommodate individual student
schedules, and classes will be

small to permit necessary indi-
vidual attention. Each student
will attend a total of twenty ses-
sions, five per week. Tuition for
the program will be $95, pay-
able by the start of the pro-
gram upon receipt of a state-
ment from Baldridge.

Further information and
registration cards may be ob-
tained from the Office of the
Dean of Stuednts, Washington
Hall 25. Interested students
should register for the course as
soon as possible.

A viable alternative to grades?

inequity within a university over-
come?

One answer, suggested by
Washington and Lee economics
professor John Gunn, would be
to rank each student in each
course he takes at Washington
and Lee. Rank in a given class
would be determined by a stu-
dent’s overall performance in in-
dividual courses. Thus, in the
class of 1975, for example, the
student who has finished first in
all of his courses would be ranked
first in his class. Class rank
would be determined by average
course standing.

According to Professor Gunn,
all the averaging out could be
handled easily by the university’s
computer. The computer could
be used to set up a “power fac-
tor” of sorts. If a student has
done well, ranking among the
top 20 percent of all his previous
courses, and he then takes a
course and finishes with a rank
in the third fifth of the class,
this would contribute to the
power factor. Such an occur-
rence, if continually repeated by
other students, would give a
power factor indicating that the
particular course is difficult.

The result, according to Pro-
fessor Gunn, would be that a
student finishing first in the
difficult course would receive a
higher ranking than would the
student finishing first in the
easy course, even if both received
grades of “A”.

The faculty has already held
a brief discussion this year on
the topic of grades, voting to
table any action or further dis-
cussion. For the time being, the
grades will continue to rise. And
grading will continue to be in-
equitable. And graduate schools
and employers will place less em-
phasis on grades and more on
standardized tests. And, in the
long run, the student will suffer.

Give Virginia scare before falling

Generals win two, ‘almost three’

By BILL fr LESHER
Phi Sports editor

In opening their 1974-75 bask-
etball season, Washington and
Lee’s basketball Generals proved
Dick Martin’s old 66.7 percent
adage to be much more than
hot air.

Verne Canfield’s troops posted
a pair of wins in the inaugural
W&L Tip-Off Tournament over
Maryville College, 94-67, and
Frostburg State, 50-49 in double
overtime, before falling to ACC
member Virginia, 77-69, in what
was more of a battle than anyone
in University Hall expected.

All three games showed the
balance Canfield is relying on in
the upcoming season, as the Gen-
erals’ leading scorers were dif-
ferent in each game.

The Frostburg State game, a
thriller in which Guy Kerr sank
a free throw with :03 left in the
second overtime for the win, was
a costly one as 6’ 6” forward
Gary Fitzgerald suffered a frac-
tured left elbow in a fall.

Fitzgerald, who led W&L with
17 points in the Maryville game,
will be out from four to six
weeks.

The details:

* 4 +.

Nervousness, butterflies, and
jitters are as big a part of an
opening night as corsages are of
that first formal.

W&L's season opener was any-
thing but incomplete.

It took a while for the Gen-
erals to shake off the tension
that had built up, but eventually
they wore down Maryville Col-
lege, finally running away in the
second half for a 94-67 win.

W&L put the Scots away with
a 36-13 splurge in the final
eleven minutes. Maryville had
hung tough up to that point,
trailing by only 38-30 at inter-
mission, and by just 58-54 before
the Generals turned on the gas.

Seven W&L players’ scored
eight or more points, led by
junior forward Gary Fitzgerald’s
17 markers.

Junior Guard John Podgajny,
who sparked W&L in the first
half with 12 points, finished the
game with 14, while senior co-
captanis Guy Kerr and Greg
Croghan added 13 and 10 points
respectively.

Randy Lambert led the Scots
with 17 points.

a + ce

No formal winner was to be
crowned in the inaugural Tip-
Off Tournament, which was de-
signed as a two-game warmup
for the Generals and Hampden-
Sydney.

As it turned out, the final
game Saturday evening would de-
termine which team would leave
Lexington with an unblemished
record. Frostburg State had dis-
posed of the Tigers on Friday,
and had shown signs of being a
troublesome test for the Gen-
erals.

Troublesome wasn't fitting
enough. The visitors were down-
right pests.

Frostburg parlayed a motley
strategy of fastbreaking, stalling,
good shooting, and tenacious de-
fense to move out to a six-point
lead midway through the first
half. It could have been more
had not the Generals equalled
Frostburg’s job on defensive play.

Late in the half W&L rallied
to earn a 23-all intermission

deadlock, as senior Guard Bow-
man Williams threw in a 25-
footer at the buzzer to even
things up.

The Generals grabbed the up-
per hand early in the second
half, and once led by seven
points. But Frostburg whittled
away at the margin, and Bob
Bidder’s jumped with 2:23 left
evened the score at 43-all, which
is how it stood as regulation time
expired.

Things got less sticky in the
first extra period, as both teams
found points a bit easier to come
by. with :56 left, Frostburg’s Ray-
mond Nelson missed a tie-break-
ing free throw, and, after another
late-second W&L shot missed,
came overtime number two, with
both teams showing 49 points.

W&L's defense dominated the
second extra period, as they held
the visitors without a shot for
the entire five minutes.

The only problem was that the
Generals couldn’t buy a basket at
the same time. Several shots were
in-and-others, others were just
outers.

The big break came with :43
left, when Paul Maloney stole the
ball from Frostburg’s Mitch
Stoller, with :06 left Jeff Baum
fired a shot in the general direc-
tion of the basket. The ball hit
the rim, and came straight down
into the hands of Kerr, who was
fouled as he shot by Frostburg’s
Frazier Nelson.

With Generals’ coach Verne
Canfield about to jump out of
the gym due to nervousness, Kerr

calmly left his first charity toss
on the front of the rim. But the
second one was dead center, and
the Generals were 2-0.

Williams led W&L with 13
points, while Fitzgearld, who left
the game midway through the
second half with an elbow in-
jury, added 12.

Bidder led all scorers with 17
points.

Sample conversation Monday
in Charlottesville’s University
Hall:

“Full house tonight?”

“No way! Who'd want to see
the Hoos beat on W&L like they
have the past few years?”

“IT guess you're right.”

As it turned out, they were far
from on the right track.

For a while it looked like the
peanut gallery’s prophecies might
be on the money, but as the
game went on Virginia’s Cava-
liers found more and more
trouble from the visiting Gen-
erals, seeing what had been a
15-point lead shrink to four late
in the game, before two baskets
by Wally Walker keyed the Wa-
hoos’ final rally for a 77-69 win.

Virginia jumped out to a 6-0
lead with four minutes gone be-
fore a John Podgajny jumper put
W&L on the scoreboard. But
with Bill Langloh and freshman
center Mare Iavaroni leading the
way, the Cavs had stretched their
lead to 27-12 midway through
the first half.

As Virginia fans clamored for
the final surge that would have

put W&L away, the Generals
responded with a spurt of their
own that got them back in the
ball game. W&L’s tenacious man-
to-man defense kept the Cavs
away from the basket, while
deadly shooting from Podgajny
and Guy Kerr brought the Gen-
erals within seven with a minute
left in the half.

But Virginia’s Mark Newlen
converted twice on the end of
fast breaks late in the half, giv-
ing the Cavs a 44-33 lead at
intermission.

Virginia shot a sparkling 71
percent from the floor in the
first twenty minutes, while W&L
hit on only 38 percent of its
shots. As it would turn out, it
was the low percentage from the
field that would cost W&L the
win.

W&L nibbled away at the Cavs
lead in the early minutes of the
second half, closing the gap to
48-40 before field goals by Dan
Bonner, Newlen, and Andy
Boninit gave Virginia a 14-point
lead.

Then W&L roared back with
10 straight points as Bonner and
Iavaroni sat on the bench with
four fouls. The Generals con-

trolled the boards at both ends
of the floor during the five-
minute stretch in which the Hoos
went scoreless. And, before Vir-
ginia’s first-year head coach
Terry Holland could call a time-
out, W&L was within four at 54-
50.

Then the Cavalier veterans
took over. Langloh and Walker
led Virginia in the final ten
minutes, as both scored six points
to put the game out of W&L’s
reach. The Generals came no
closer than six after the Virginia
timeout, as the hosts relied on
their experience and poise to ice
the game away.

Langloh led all scorers with 16
points, while teammates Iavaroni
and Walker chipped in with 14
and 13 points each.

Bonner, starting his first game
for Virginia, went five-for-five
from the field for 10 points.

Podgajny and Croghan led a
balanced scoring attack for
W&L with 14 points each. Kerr
added 13 while sophomore center
Notm Kristoff, playing more
than he had in the first two
games combined, posted 12 points
and led all players with 10 re-
bounds.

The pieces which will be re-
produced by the French manu-
facturer are three. The largest of
these is the Arms of Liberty bowl,
cirea 1775, which bears poly-
chrome cartouches of John Wil-

punished him for his opinions,

a polychrome eagle within a
medallion closely resembling the
Great Seal. All these pieces are
hard paste porcelain from 18th
century design.

Negotiations are also underway
for the reproduction of other
pieces of the Reeves Collection
including a soft paste example of
a mid-cighteenth century cream-

WésL now offers special courses
in Chinese, East Asian Studies

By Steve Yevich
Phi Staff Reporter

There are over 100 million
people in Japan, and countless
millions more in China, yet only
about 400 Americans per year are
sent to these countries to study,
compared to the thousands sent
to Europe each year.

Obviously more Americans
should be given exposure to Asian
countries, their languages and
customs, their religions and
philosophies, their cultures.

Wé&L is concerned about this
lack of exposure to Eastern cul-
ture and is organizing a new
program on East Asian Studies.

Significant interest in courses
dealing with the two Chinas was
first shown in the winter of ‘71-
72. At that time W&L had two

resident experts on the East: Dr.
Harold Hill (in sinology) and
Mr. I-Hsiung Ju (a native of
China). Dr. Charles Turner also
taught several history courses
dealing with the Orient at the
time.

The core of a Chinese Studies
program was developed, courses
in Mandarin Chinese were add-
ed, and applications were made
for several grants. A $30,000
erant from the Babcock Founda-
tion was received in support of
the new program, which focused
on Chinese language, culture,
political and economic charac-
teristics. Dr. William Pusey, head
of the German department, was
made program director pro tem-
pore.

the Chinese Studies program, in-

position on faculty

Dr. Gary H. Dobbs, UI has
been appointed assistant profes-
sor of biology for the winter and
sprine terms while that depart-
ment continues its search for a
new department head to replace
Dr. Henry S&S. Roberts who died
last February.

A native of Birmingham, Dr.
Dobbs is a 1970 graduate of
Washington and Lee. He was
graduated Summa Cum Laude,
ranking first in his class, and a
member of Phi Beta Kappa. Dur-
ing career here he was a
scholar in every sense: Washing-
ton Scholar Ureshman year),
Robert E. Lee Research Scholar
(1967-69), Alfred P. Sloan Re-
search Scholar (1967-69) and
Henry Ruffner Scholar (1969-
70).

He continued his education at
the University of California at
San Diego where he worked to-

nls

ward a Ph. D. in marine biology.
Dobbs spent six months in the
sfitarclic studying the glycopro-
teins in fish which work as a

permanent’ antifreeze in the

1isn system.

After completing the five year
program at San Diego in four
years, Dr. Dobbs accepted the of-
fer to return to W&L temporar-
ily. This summer he will begin a
two-year post-doctoral fellow-
ship at the University of North
Carolina studying electron mic-
roscopy.

terest was shown in establishing
courses dealing with Japan. The
addition of Dr. Minor Rogers to
the faculty in 1972 helped to fur-
ther this interest, as Rogers has
a considerable knowledge of Jap-
anese religion, language and cul-
ture.

The acceptance of W&L into
the Luce Scholar Program, a gra-
duate fellowship program design-
ed to send qualified students to
East Asia for study, and the es-
tablishment of the exchange pro-
gram with Chung-Chi University
have also helped to build interest
in studies not necessarily relating
to China, but nevertheless Eas-
tern.

So at present there is a dual
program of sorts: Chinese stu-
dies, under Pusey’s guidance, and
the other Asian studies. There
are efforts now under way to
combine these programs and pro-
vide unified direction under a
Director of East Asian Studies.

“At the moment things are
sprouting all over; the program
is not homogenized.” With that
statement Pusey aptly summed
up the situation. There are many
varied course offerings and pro-
grams, but they seem to be pi-
eeonholed in assorted depart-
ments, and without any central
coordination.

Just what courses with orien-
tal subject material are offered?

|REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

 

If Friday is Thursday,
then this must be W&L

As the winter term begins and everything starts looking
somewhat bleaker we have found one thing which should
make the new year an improvement on the old—the calendar.

The school calendar for next year is in some respects one
that will bring the W&L community back into the world of the
sane. To begin with it recognizes a Friday as a Friday and a
Saturday as a Saturday. This may sound simple enough but
last year’s University Council came up with the not-so-bright
idea of rearranging the calendar in a most unsatisfactory man-
ner.

Last year the faculty gave the UC the power to provide
the school community with a calendar which it would not
even take the time to approve. As a result of its handing over
this function to the UC we have a schedule which shows
classes commencing on a Friday, and as if that was not bad
enough we are asked to treat Friday as Thursday and turn
Saturday into Friday.

For a number of fairly obvious reasons this scheduling
creates hardships on the people it is suppose to serve. Arriv-
ing back on campus for January 3 classes made it necessary for
students from Arkansas and Texas to leave home on January
1, nursing an awful hangover which would have been more
easily coped with from a reclining position while the victim
watched tube. To ask the typical W&L student to venture
onto the highways on New Year’s Day is not only inconveni-
ent and unreasonable—it is nothing less than dangerous.

What has been accomplished by starting classes up on Fri-
day /Thursday? Supposedly it has provided for the correct num-
ber of Thursdays and Fridays in the winter term. After seeing
classes called last week with less than one half of the expected
crowd attending and hearing professors dismiss their students
with the promise to repeat themselves at the next class meet-
ing we doubt that starting the winter term on January 3 has
been too successful,

This is not to say that the university should only approve
policies that the students will adopt and adhere to readily,
but there should be an understanidng of geographical limita-
tions which make it inconvenient for the student who lives be-
yond Glasgow to arrive at school on a certain date.

This year the faculty decided to reassert itself and reclaim
the final word scheduling for the 1975-76 academic year.
Consequently W&L students will be asked to return for classes
which first meet on a Monday—in fact, they will meet on a
Monday that is really Monday, not a Tuesday or Sunday in-
stead.

Next year’s Washington Holiday is an improvement over
this year's in that it is longer, but its placement leaves some-
thing to be desired. That vacation runs from February 12-17
this winter term where it will give students a full week off next
year. It is placed at the end of six weeks of the winter term
which obviously has some merit. On the other hand, this year’s
vacation falls at the beginning of Lent which means that
everyone can go to Mardi Gras and miss two days of classes at
most. Next year the Washington Holiday comes a full week
before Mardi Gras—obviously inconvenient for one who wants
to make the most of one’s time off from the grind,

One serious suggestion that we would like to make is that
some schedule be adopted which will allow students at Wash-
ington and Lee to have a few reading days before exams start.
As it stands, next year students return from Thanksgiving to
find exams staring them in the face the same week, Many other
schools have several days after the end of classes and before
exams start in which students may prepare themselves for
their tests and ask professors questions. Presently many pro-
fessors give short tests in the last few class meetings before
exams which works a hardship on their pupils and gives them
less time to prepare themselves for the holocaust soon to
follow.

In summation, we believe that next year's schedule for the
school is something of an improvement. However, more could
be done to make the calendar relect a more convenient ar-
rangement for the student body. J.L.R.

An interview

Thursday, January 9, 1975

Nuckols speaks of Wé#L’s future

Editor’s Notes The following is
the first of a two-part interview
with the new Rector of the Board
of Trustees, E. Marshall Nuckols.
The interview was telephoned as
a list of questions to Mr. Nuckols
who returned his answers by mail
lo the editor.

1. Q. What do you believe to be
the most important responsibil-
ity of the Rector of the Board of
Trustees?

1. A. If you were to ask that
question a year from now I am
sure I could give you a more
confident answer. After all, I am
still quite new in this job. One of
the most important roles must,
however, be to lead, coordinate,
and motivate the Trustees in
their constant efforts to keep
Washington and Lee the small,
strong, independent educational
institution that it has been for
so Many years.

As Ben Bailey indicated after
his meeting with the Trustees in
Alexandria, we have an excep-
tionally dedicated and concerned
group of men serving on the
Board. All of them believe their
years at Washington and Lee
were among the most important
in their lives and that the Uni-
versity provided them not only
an exceptional educational ex-
perience but also a unique oppor-
tunity to develop traits of char-
acter and leadership that have
stood them in good stead thro-
ughout their adult lives. All of
these men feel a great debt to
the University and are complete-
ly dedicated to preserving similar
opportunities for other students
in the years ahead.

These men need little addition-
al motivation but it is a great

honor to be asked to lead and co-
ordinate their efforts.

2. Q. What would you say is the
role of the Rector in fund rais-
ing?

2. A. One of the most important
functions the Trustees perform
in keeping Washington and Lee
strong obviously is that of rais-
ing funds.

Washington and Lee is a com-
pletely private, independent in-
stitution—receiving no state, fed-
eral, or church support—so fund
raising is critical. Here again the
Rector has a leadership and a
coordination responsibility. The
direct responsibility for capital
fund raising activities has, how-
ever, been assigned to a Develop-
ment Committee of the Board of
which Trustee John M. Stem-
mons is Chairman. This Develop-
ment Committee is devoting a
great deal of time and effort to
the current program to raise cap-
ital funds for the new library
and other campus improvements.
Sydney Lewis, another Trustee,

is chairman of the Current Sup-
port Committee, which devotes its
efforts to increasing the funds
raised from alumni and parents
for annual operating expenses.
The Rector’s role is one of back-
ing up the efforts of these Com-
mittees.

3. Q. Based on your years of close
association with Washington and
Lee what fundamental changes
have you observed in the school?
3. A. I believe—as do other Trus-
tees—that there have been no
significant changes—only im-
provements—in the truly basic
fundamentals which have made
Washington and Lee such a uni-
que institution. The quality of
education offered—the excellence
of the faculty—breadth of the
curriculum—all have improved.
We have a strong, highly quali-
fied school administration and
the University continues to draw
an excellent mix of students. The
honor system still plays an im-
portant role. Ben Bailey’s com-
ments at our Alexandria Trus-

tees’ Meeting indicated that it is
stronger today than it was a few
years ago. There seems to be an
excellent community sense at the
University and students are play-
ing an increasingly meaningful
role in student government and
in the affairs of the University.

There have been changes, of
course, in some of the campus
traditions—dress is more infor-
mal than it used to be—more in-
formal perhaps than some of the
alumni would like. This, of course,
is a trend of the times.

Perhaps the most noticeable
changes have been the improve-
ment in the physical facilities—
the new gymnasium, a new Law
School, the student Center, new
dormitories, and hopefully soon
a new library.

In short, the Trustees are gen-
erally quite pleased with the state
of affairs at the University and
with its administration, faculty,
and student body. We want very
much to keep it that way.

Has grade inflation halted?

By PAUL LANCASTER
Phi Managing Editor

If last term’s final grades are
any indication, grade inflation is
slowing at Washington and Lee.

The question, however, is
whether last term’s final grades
really are any indication. They
represent only one marking per-

To the Students and Faculty of Washington and Lee:
The members of the Student Association for Black Unity

would like to invite you, the students and faculty, to partici-
pate in our Black Awareness Week, January 12-18, 1975. We as
Black students feel that as a part of our education, a part of
any education should encompass an understanding of the peo-
ple and events surrounding them. Our organization’s main ob-
jective is to try to emphasis how the Black man feels, how he
views today’s society and the changes that it goes through;
changes that affect all men, both black and white.

In accordance to our objective, the theme chosen for this
year’s Black Awareness Week is “Projections of Blackness.”
The week is outlined as follows:

Sunday—Dr. David Shannon, Academic Dean, Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary. Speaking on the Black Religious Ex-
perience. 8:00—Lee Chapel

Monday—Samuel Proctor, Dean of Graduate Education,
Rutgers University. Speaking on the Black man and His Edu-
cation. 8 :00—Lee Chapel

Tuesday—Virginia Union University Concert Choir, 7 :00—
Lee Chapel

Wednesday—The Leslie D, Smith Memorial Lecture pre-
sented by Dr. Wyatt T. Walker, Pastor of Canaan Baptist
Church, of New York. Speaking on the Black Man in Ameri-
can Contemporary Society. 8:00—Lee Chapel

Thursday—Mr. Edward Robinson, Athletic Director and
Head Football Coach, Grambling State College. 8:00—Lee
Chapel

Saturday—The Black Ball, Evans Dining Hall. Formal.
Invitation only. Featuring the “98.6” of Washington, D.C.
8:00
This year's Ball is open to all Washington and Lee students.
Invitations may be picked up at the §.A.B.U. office in the Uni-
versity Center before Wednesday, January 15.

The members of the Student Association for Black Unity
extend this invitation to you hoping that you will take it upon
yourselves to come to the presentations during the week, in
order to better understand the presence of the Black in our
society, and perhaps more about yourselves,

ate whether grade inflation has
has actually slowed. No firmly-
based conclusions can be drawn.
Nonetheless, there are several in-
teresting changes in departmen-
tal grade point ratios (GPR) as
compared to the fall term of
1973.

Two departments which regis-
tered significant increases in
GPR from the fall term of 1973
to that of 1974 were politics and
economics, according to the Uni-
versity registrar’s office. The
politics GPR for all courses in
the department rose by .273 to
2.559. The department of econo-
mics GPR rose .101 to 2.332. Poli-
tics and economics are among
those university departments
with the lowest overfall GPR’s at
Washington and Lee.

Not all increases were recorded
by departments with low GPR’s,
however. Those members of the
fine arts curriculum, known to
have one of the highest GPR’s of
any major discipline on campus,
also registered an overall gain in
GPR from fall of 1973 to fall of
1974. The drama GPR climbed
the most of any major discipline
on campus—up .280 to 3.011. The
art GPR rose modestly by .069 to
2.883, while the music GPR de-
clined modestly by .021 to 2.942.

GPR since the fall of 1973. Some
figures; Italian up 306 to 3.0;

Latin up .135 to 2.950; Greek up
182 to 3.0; French up .237 to
2.957; German up .048 to 2.998;
Russian up .050 to 3.050; and
Spanish up .086 to 2.959. Chinese

Comparative literature and bio-
declined .168 to 2.5.
logy also registered gains in GPR
of more than .1. Anthropology,
English, geology, history, journa-
lism, psychology, and religion all
registered increases in GPR of
less than .1.

What departments registered
declines in GPR? Computer sci-
ence recorded the biggest decline
—.225 to 2.464. Accounting de-
clined .227 to 2.258 (the lowest
departmental GPR recorded last
term). Engineering declined .225
to 2.737. Chemistry, philosophy,
physics, public speaking and soc-
iology all registered declines in
GPR of between .1 and .2. Ad-
ministration, mathematics and
military science, all declined less
than .1 of a grade point.

Of all Washington and Lee de-
partments and disciplines, nine
recorded GPR’s last term of 2.5
or below while 10 registered
GPR's of 3.0 or above. Those at
or below 2.5 GPR include, in or-
der from the lowest, accounting,
mathematics, English, sociology,
economics, geology, administra-
tion, computer science, and Chi-

Generals grab WésL tourney title

Winning streak extended to five

iy BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

Washington and Lee turned on
the defense to shut down two
high-powered offensive teams to
win the 6th annual Invitational
Basketball Tournament Satur-
day, stopping Williams College in
the final game, 61-49 .

The Generals got to the finals
by beating Haverford College on
Friday, 56-43. The wins marked
the first time W&L, now 7-1, had
won its own tournament since
1969. The title also extended
W&L's win streak to five going
into Tuesday’s game against
Bridgewater.

W&L head coach Verne Can-
field was forced to go to his
bench more often against Wil-
liams, as injuries had forced
starters Paul Maloney and Guy
Kerr out of the final game.

“We couldn’t hesitate to go to
the bench, especially with Guy
and Paul getting hurt on Friday,”
Canfield said.

Yet the bench came through
with a strong effort, as forwards
Jeff Baum and Bob Flint, and
backcourters Kim Sims and
freshman Bob Forlenza filled the
holes more than credibly.

But the story of the tourna-
ment was the Generals‘ defense,
which now ranks among the top

December in review

five in the NCAA’s Division III.
On successive nights W&L held
teams averaging over 70 points
per game to under 50 points. In
addition, two players, Dick Voith
of Haverford and Harry Sheehy
of Williams, both 24 points per
game scorers, were held to their
career lows of 12 points each.

“The team defense was super
for the entire tournament,” Can-
field said. “Bowman Williams
and John Podgajny did a fine
job in stopipng Voith and Shee-
hy, but it wasn’t their efforts
alone which won the tournament
for us.”

Wiliams, named the most valu-
able player of the tournament,
played two of his finest games for
W&L. He led the Generals’ bal-
anced scoring attack against Ha-
verford with 12 points while
teaming with Podgajny to hold
Voith to 12 points. In the cham-
pionship game Williams scored
eleven points, played an excellent
floor game, and harassed Sheehy,
a Little All-American candidate,
to hold him to 12 points.

Another excellent W&L perfor-
mance came from 6’9” junior
center Norm Kristoff, who join-

ed Williams on the all-tourney
team.

“Norm dominated the middle
in both games, which is very im-
portant to our overall game plan,”
Canfield said. “He did a good job
rebounding, shot very well, and
intimidated enough inside to
force our opponents outside,
which is where we want them to
try to score from.”

Kristoff had the most impres-
sive statistics in the tournament,
shooting better than fifty per-
cent from the field in getting 11
points against Haverford and a
game-high 12 against Williams,
grabbing 22 total rebounds,
blocking five shots, and adding
three assists.

The Generals started slowly
against Haverford, missing 10 of
their first 12 shots. The Fords
grabbed a 7-4 lead, which was
the only lead they held all night.

A Kristoff tip narrowed the
margin to 7-6, then Williams con-
nected on a 25-footer to give
W&L the lead for good. WkL
took a 28-20 lead into the locker
room at halftime, then steadily
increased their lead in the second
half.

Generals winning as ’74 ends

By BILL FLESHER

Phi Sports Editor

For a while Santa Claus couldn't
figure out what to give Washing-
ton and Lee’s winter athletic
teams for a Christmas present.

As a last resort, he decided to
vive them a fun-filled month of
December.

He couldn't have given a bet-
ter present.

With the exception of the
Generals’ basketball loss to Vir-
ginia on December 2, W&L’'s
three winter teams compiled a
perfect 9-0 record in the final
month of 1974.

A recap of December, 1974:

DECEMBER 3—W&L’'s wrest-
lers started their season off with
a 29-11 win over Madison Col-
lege. Sophomores Jim Crytzer
(158) and Steve Schweizerhof
(HVY) recorded pins for W&L,
while senior co-captain Doug
Ford (177), Brian Tray (142),
and Sam Lewis (167) earned de-
cisions. Freshman Howdy Knipp
won his 118-pound match by
forfeit.

Freshman John Hudson broke
the state record in the 1000-yard
freestyle to lead W&L's swimmers
to an easy 61-41 win over Old
Dominion.

Hudson, who in his first meet
at W&L broke school records in
the 200-, 500-, and 100-yard free

The Generals piled up a big
lead early in the meet, and Coach
Bill Stearns let swimmers pick
their own events for the rest of
the meet.

DECEMBER 4—Greg Croghan
canned an 18-foot shot with sev-
en seconds left in overtime to
give the basketball Generals a
63-61 win over VCAA rival Lyn-
chburg College.

Playing their fourth game in
six nights, W&L showed signs of
sluggishness throughout the
contest. The Generals led by as
many as 12 points early in the
second half, but couldn’t hold
it as the visiting Hornets storm-
ed back from a flurry of points to
take a 49-40 lead.

W&L then rallied to tie the
game at 57-all, with Bowman
Wiliams’ 25-footer forcing the
deadlock.

Both teams traded two baskets
in the overtime. Then Croghan
fired up a shot from near the
corner, and the Generals found
themselves up by two.

Lynchburg had one last oppor-
tunity to tie it when John Podga-
jny fouled the Hornets’ Frank
Gough with :03 left. However,
Gough missed the free throw,
and W&L held on to win.

Norm Kristoff led W&L with
15 points and nine rebounds.

W&L's wrestlers earned two
dual meet wins in Petersburg,
Va., downing Virginia State, 25-
17, and Lynchburg, 33-6.

Howdy Knipp (118), Lee Keck
(134), Jim Crytzer (158), Doug
Ford (177), and Bill Cole (190)
each scored two wins for W&L,

Crytzer extended his pinning
streak to three with a pair of
falls.

Cole scored the fastest pin of
the meet with a :34 fall against
Lynchburg.

DECEMBER 16—With Norm
Kristoff scoring a season high 20
points, the basketball Generals
won the first of two games in
Boston, nipping Framingham
State, 70-69.

W&L led by 10 points midway
through the second half, but saw
that lead slip away as Framing-
ham got hot from the outside.

The Generals got two clutch
free throws from Bowman Wil-
liams with :09 left to put the
game out of reach.

W&L coach Verne Canfield said
the Generals were a bit off in
their timing, as was to be expect-
ed after a ten day layoff during
exams.

Canfield added that Framing-
ham State saw W&L as the big
game on their schedule, saying.
“There’s nothing they would
have liked more than to beat the
team that got close to Virginia.”

En route to a swimming vaca-
tion-practice schedule in Flori-
da, W&L's swimmers stopped in
North Carolina long enough to
win two dual meets against Ap-
palachian State, 59-54, and UNC-
Asheville, 77-35.

Junior Bill Tiers was the lone
double winner for W&L, picking
up victories in the 500- and 1000-
yard freestyles.

Haverford made one run late in
the game to close the margin to
48-40, but two field goals by Don
Berlin, who saw extensive action
at center for W&L in the second
half, put the game on ice.

Neither team enjoyed a good
shooting night, as both finished
at around 33 percent. But the big
statistics were the 30 turnovers
committed by Haverford (includ-
ing nine by Voith), and the dif-
ference in shots attempted (W&L
got off 76 shots compared to
Haverford’s 57).

Many saw the Generals as un-
derdogs to Williams in the finals
on the basis of the injuries to
Kerr and Maloney as well as the
Ephmen’s easy 89-71 win over
Kings Point in the opening
round. Sheehy had looked good
in the opener, scoring 27 points
on 12 for 17 from the field.

For a while Sheehy stayed hot,

WeL co-captain Greg Croghan is above the crowd
as he shoots for two of his ten points against

hitting three of his first four
shots to keep Williams within
one of the Generals. But Bow-
man Wililams’ defense then stiff-
ened, as did that of the Generals.

Slowly W&L pulled away from
Williams (the college, that is), as
and they took a 36-25 lead at
halftime. Flint came off the
bench in the first half to score
three clutch baskets, while the
play of Sims and Forlenza at the
playmaking guard continued to
impress the crowd of 1100 in
Doremus Gym.

W&L upped their lead to as
many as 17 points in the second
half before the Ephmen could
make a comeback.

Wiliams (the college, again)
scored seven unanswered points
to close the gap to 10 with seven
minutes left. They moved within
seven at 54-47 with 4:20 to go
before a Jeff Baum basket and

two free throws by John Podga-
jny put the game out of reach.

Kristoff led W&L with 12
points, while Greg Croghan and
Williams (Bowman) added 11
each. Baum, in his first start,
scored 10 points while adding
eight rebounds.

The all-tournament team con-
sisted of Williams, Kristoff, Shee-
hy, Dave Stubbs of Haverford,
and Bill Carter of Kings Point.

Haverford defeated Kings
Point for third place, 69-67.

Last year’s game in Lexington

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Nuckols

on WéeL:

optimistic about future

(Continued from page 2)

4. Q. What do you see as the
major challenge facing the Uni-
versity in the immediate future?
Do you think Washington and
Lee can compete effectively in the
future with large Co-Educational
universities on the one hand, and
small community colleges on the
other?
4. A. I have combined these two
questions because they are close-
ly related. The major challenge
facing the University obviously is
a financial one. Washington and
Lee finished last year with a sur-
plus of income over expenditures
of only a few hundred dollars.
The budget for the current year
has no reserve for any contingen-
cies, yet we are faced with a con-
tinuing inflation in all University
expenses.

Tuition

rates have already

been pushed to a level substanti-

ally above tuition expenses at the
large state universities or at the
smailer community colleges. It is
questionable how much further
tuitions could be raised.

This is a problem faced by all
private colleges. Washington and
Lee has been more successful
than most to date. Many other
private schools have had deficit
years.

To meet this challenge we ob-
viously must substantially in-
crease our endowment and the
level of annual alumni giving.
We must also do all we can to
operate as efficiently as possible.

The Trustees believe these chal-
lenges can be met and that there
will continue to be a place for the
small, independent, private col-
leges. We are dedicated to that
goal.

Teams fare well in December

(Continued from page 3)

W&L was without freshman
John Hudson, who did not make
the trip to Florida.

The two wins upped the Gen-
erals season record to 4-1.

DECEMBER 17—Believe it or
not, Washington and Lee played
some of its sloppiest basketball
in a game they won by 59, count
‘em, 59 points.

The Generals had less than no
trouble beating Massachusetts
Maritime, 93-34, despite going
scoreless for some seven minutes
in the first half.

“We found ourselves against
an inept basketball team,” said
Verne Canfield after the game,
“and for a while, nobody seemed
to want to play.”

After jumping out to a 21-4
lead, W&L apparently went into

hiding, and Maritime closed the
gap to 21-16. But after a few
strong words of advice from the
bench, the Generals went on to
score 34 points in a row, includ-
ing the first 24 points of the sec-
ond half.

Junior John Podgajny led four
W&L players in double figures
with 16 points, while Norm Kris-
toff added a season high 17 re-
bounds.

The win was the third in a row
for W&L, leaving the season re-
cord at 5-1 as the players went
home for Christmas.

Black experience explored

By JO FIPZGERALD

Speakers, a concert, and a
“soul food” banquet highlighted
the events of Black Awareness
Week at W&L this week. In
addition, Black Awareness Week
Ball will be held Saturday night
in the Evans Dining Hall. The
purpose of the events, according
to the director of the affair,
John X. Miller, was to “make
the white student more aware”
of the black presence and experi-
ence in society.

The speakers have included Dr.
Samuel Proctor, Dean of Gradu-

ate Education at Rutgers Uni-
versity, Rev. Wyatt T. Walker
of the Canaan Baptist Church
in New York City, and Edward
Robinson, head football coach at
Grambling College. The concert
was performed by the Virginia
Union University Concert Choir.

Dr. Proctor spoke Monday
night in Lee Chapel on the sub-
ject of the “Black Educational
Experience.’ He spoke of his
time at Yale in 1945 when he
was one of four blacks in the
graduate school there. He said
the racism he encountered there
“toughened me” and suggested

that today’s black students could
learn from his experience there.

Tuesday night featured the
Virginia Union University Con-
cert Choir performing in the
chapel. The presentation, en-
titled ‘Music: A Door to Inter-
national Understanding,” featur-
ed mainly gospel music and a
selection from Giuseppe Verdi’s
opera, “Rigoletto.” In keeping
with the theme, the singers wore
colorful costumes from various
parts of the world during the
first half of the program.

Mock Convention group
prepares for May of ’76

By STEVE YEVICH

With the organizational meet-
ing last Thursday night, the
W&L Mock Convention Commit-
tee visibly began moving toward
its goal of developing a working
imitation of the Democratic Na-
tional Convention by May, 1976.

Much of the hardest work,
however, has already been ac-
complished behind the scenes.
The budget has been drawn up,
all committee functions have
been delineated, committee
chairmen picked, and most of
the basic planning completed.

According to Ken Ruscio, co-

chairman of the Steering Com-
mittee, most of his group’ efforts
to date have been spent in pre-
liminary planning and develop-
ment of specific goals for each
committee. Most of September,
for example, was spent in or-
ganizing a working budget for
the $20,000 allocated for the con-
vention. (Of this, $6000 is from
a Texas foundation and $8000
will be raised by a special $5 ac-
tivities assessment on every stu-
dent's tuition next year.)

The Steering Committee has
been trying hard to secure a
speaker for the winter term, as

Debate team captures trophies,
Takes 6 awards in tournament

Still early in the debate season,
debaters representing Washing-
ton and Lee University have
brought to ten the number of
trophies won so far this year by
sweeping six awards at the re-
cent regional tournament of Del-
ta Sigma Rho/Tau Kappa Alpha,
the principal debate fraternity.

Four W&L debaters — Bill
Gonch, Rodney Petersen, Eddie
Fisher and Mare Levin—again
captured the William Wells Chaf-
fin memorial trophy, the regional
organization's most prestigious
award. The Chaffin trophy is
named for Washington and Lee’s
late debate coach, who was kill-
ed in an automobile accident in
1970 while returning from a de-
bate meet in New England.

Competing in the debate meet
were teams from colleges in
Maryland, Virginia, and Wash-
ington, D.C. In addition to the
Chaffin award, W&L debaters

 

: ‘ ™
i dward Valentine

ve the ite Oo

won first-place and fifth-place
team trophies (Gonch and Peter-
sen, first; Fisher and Levin,
fifth). Individual trophies were
awarded to Levin, named third-
best overall speaker in the tour-
ney: Petersen, fifth-best, and
Gonch, second place in impromp-
tu speaking.

The 10 trophies earned so far
place the W&L team substanti-
ally ahead of its standing at this
point a year ago, when the team
was on its way to its best record
in recent years with a year end
total of 17 trophies.

Halford R. Ryan, W&L’s debate
coach and this year’s president of
the Virginia Forensic Association,
was elected assistant regional
governor of the Maryland-Vir-
einia-D.C. district of Delta Sig-
ma Rho/Tau Kappa Alpha at a
business meeting held to coin-
cide with the regional tourna-
ment.

well as one for spring term, but
so far efforts have been unsuc-
cessful. At various times Sena-
tors Jackson, Kennedy, Mon-
dale, Muskie and Ribicoff have
been contacted for possible speak-
ing engagements, but all have
declined. It is possible a speak-
er of note may yet be procured
for February, but no firm com-
mitments have been received.

Enough interest has already
been stirred within the state that
Virginia notified W&L over the
weekend that the 1976 Mock
Convention has been designated
an official Virginia Bicentennial
Event. This is quite a compli-
ment for a student-run affair
that has been correct ten out of
fifteen times, including a string
of correct choices running from
the 1940's up to 1972.

Of all the subordinate commit-
tees, the Credentials Committee
will by far be the most important
in the whole process. It will serve
as a check on the political re-
search of each state delegation,
and has the task of analyzing the
complex election rules which
vary in each state. Already the
Credentials Committee has writ-
ten to every state for detailed in-
formation concerning such items
a sprimary election laws and
dates, vote-counting procedures,
and methods of choosing dele-
gates for the national conven-
tion.

Next month the Credentials
Committee will spend the bulk of
its time evaluating the results of
the Democratic mini-convention
heid late last fall and its impact
on next year’s convention.

This Committee will be sub-
divided into four geographic re-
gions to provide better coordina-

Wednesday night by Rev. Walker.
The theme of the lecture was
“Contributions of the Black Man
to American Society.” The lec-
ture is dedicated to the first black
graduate of the W&L law school,
who was murdered in 1970 in
Washington, D.C. while work-
ing with the Justice Department.

Eddie Robinson, the winning-
est black coach in college foot-
ball, was scheduled to speak
Thursday night on “The Black
Man in Athletics.”

All of the events except the
concert were followed by a re-
ception in the Alumni House.

Monday’s speech was attended
by a small mostly black crowd.
The concert was seen by a larger
group, composed of both black
and white students, as well as
faculty and persons from town.
Wednesday the audience was
again fairly small, but contained
more white students than Mon-
day's crowd.

The week concludes Saturday
with the B.A.W. Ball. The Ball
will be a formal affair sponsored
by S.A.B.U. and the Student

SABU president emphasizes

Black Awareness Week goal

By STEVE YEVICH

Black Awareness Week, which
has been going on for several
days, is the culmination of nearly
a year’s planning by the Student
Association for Black Unity.

Eugene Perry, president of
SABU, said that the purpose of
this week was “to project the
ideas and feelings of the black
man toward America and to give
examples of contributions blacks
have made and continue to make
to society.”

More specifically, Perry ex-
pressed the hope that the week's
activities would “make the stu-
dent body and faculty more
cognizant of all blacks and in
particular of Washington and
Lee's black students, and with a
sincere effort on the part of the
school, to bring out a community
of black and white based on
friendship and trust.”

Last March the members of
SABU compiled a list of possible

speakers, blacks prominent in
their fields, and gave it to
Lutrelle Rainey, then head of
Student Minority Affairs. Rainey,
who at one time or another had
met most of the prospective
speakers, contacted them, and
narrowed the list to about a
dozen men in various professions.
Choices were made from the
remaining speakers on the basis
of their breadth of experience,
achievement in their fields, and
a similarity between their experi-
ences and those of the black stu-
dent on campus.

According to Perry, most of
the lecturers, realizing the limit-
ed financial resources of SABU,
agreed to present their talks for
free, and in some cases they paid
for their own expenses.

John X. Miller was appointed
head of a committee to handle
the necessary travel and lodging
arrangements, as well as to
organize the Black Awareness

EC sets dates
for public talks

on honor system

By the Phi News Staff

On Monday night the student
Executive Committee set Jan.
22-23 as the dates for public
hearings on the future of the
honor system, which will be held
at 7:00 p.m. in Lee Chapel on
both nights. In preparation,
President Ben Bailey appointed
each E.C. member to canvass a
particular building on campus
in search of faculty help in pub-
licizing the upcoming hearing.

The members are to ask the
instructors to inform students in
classes about the E.C. honor
survey and give students who had
not heard about it a chance to
fill out the forms. The forms,
which have been distributed by
the E.C. since December, ask for
student opinion on the jurisdic-
tion, penalties, and procedure for
honor trials.

‘The members were also to ask
faculty members for their views
on the honor system, including
the public hearings.

In other business, the E.C.
heard from David Graham of the
Library Committee concerning
the disappearance of books from
libraries on campus. The E.C.
agreed to fund the placement of
more noticeable signs in the
libraries stating that the honor
ystem is in full force there,

Graham also reported that the
leh oO nthe door of the “hono:
silence room of MeCormick
Library had been taken down
E.C. member Robert Pugh had
compiained that the signs im-
pied that talking in that room
Was an honor violation. He cited

on the honor code which states
that &@ man should not give his
word on trivial matters.

. .
Unwarranted and irresponsible

The arrangements for the Black Ball/Black Awareness
Week Ball which involved both the Student Activities Board
and the Student Association for Black Unity have shown
both these parties at their worst, although for different rea-
sons. When we speak of the SAB and SABU we refer ex-
clusively to the members of the SAB who have been in-
volved, i.e., John Killpack and David Mathews, and those four
or five Blacks who as members of SABU have been the lead-
ing force on the other side of the conflict.

The four or five members of SABU directly participating
in the drama have been guilty of failing to communicate fairly
and frankly with the Student Activities Board and_ their
manner has bordered on arrogance. The SAB leaders, on the
other hand, capitulated too readily to pressure from a special
interest group and in doing so failed to represent and serve
the majority of the student body to whom they are primarily
responsible.

Before offering our comments on the circumstances which
led up to Black Culture Week, a brief recounting of the
Byzantine court intrigue, hopefully as factual an account as
is possible, would be in order.

Last year the Student Activities Board, in this case the
entire board, responded positively to a request from the
leaders of SABU to help fund a concert during Black
Awareness Week. The SAB promised $2000 for a concert if
SABU could match its contribution, Earlier this academic
year it became apparent that SABU could not come up with
its share. Previously, members of SABU had failed repeatedly
to attend meetings of the SAB to communicate to that body
about preparations for the joint venture,

In December when it appeared that Black Awareness
Week might not be all that it had been promised to be, a group
of freshmen made its complaints to Washington Hall authori-
ties. These blacks felt that they had in some sense been cheat-
ed when they joined SABU with expectations that could
not now be met. The administration then became somewhat
involved in that it brought together the SAB and the SABU
to work out another program suitable to both parties.

The members of SABU insisted that SAB provide them
with funds for the Black Ball and that the negotiations be
held during final examinations in December. This, although
inconvenient for the men from the SAB, took place. The SAB
finally promised to make $400 available and wanted to co-
sponsor a gala called a Black Awareness Week Ball which
would be free and open to all students, provide beer and be
informal. SABU insisted that the Ball be formal and with no
beer served, agreeing to the other conditions, and the SAB
capitulated.

Last week the Ring-tum Phi printed an invitation to the
activities of Black Awareness Week from its coordinator,
john X. Miller. The invitation from SABU referred to the
Black Ball, adding that it was formal and by invitation only
the invitations being available to any student of W&L who
cared to pick one up in SABU’s office. No mention was made
of the SAB’s co-sponsorship.

In reaction to this invitation the SAB made and distribut-
ed posters advertising the Black Awareness Week Ball and
did not mention the required invitations to be picked up. As
a result four members of SABU visited the member of the
SAB responsible for the new posters and accused him ol
undermining their Ball. In response to the intimidating visit
the posters were withdrawn and new ones were made men-
tioning the invitation requirement. At this point the invita
tions are available in the Student Center at the information
office.

The members of SABU active in this affair earlier refused
to discuss their plans and problems with SAB and finally
worked through the administration. After an agreement had
been supposedly finalized SABU failed to honor its commiut-
ment to the SAB to advertise the Ball as a joint venture and
as the Black Awareness Week Ball which does sound a good
deal less clannish than “Black Ball.” The active members of
SABU failed to deal openly with the SAB and last week paid
an unwarranted group visit to a member of the SAB in order
that they might get their way.

The Student Activities Board apparently felt compelled
to help finance the Ball when negotiations were set up by
the administration but it should not have committed funds
from the Student Body tax to an event which is obviously
designed with the interest of a minority of the students in
mind. Although the affair is open to all, one can hardly deny
that it is tailor made to meet the interests of only a small
group within the community, The 5 \B should allot its funds
to functions which will serve the greatest number of students.

Theoretically the Ball is open to all, but most of those
people involved in the intrigue would admit that the attend
ance will not be truly representative of the people who paid

could invite all the students but everyone would fully realize

and demand funding for a Jewish or Catholic Ball,
that the program was designed to meet the wants and needs
of a small group rather than to serve the greatest number ol

Phe result of all this is that the Student Activities Board
has not done its job in this intance and has established a
dangerous precedent, SABU, on the other hand, has confused
and refused to work within the framework of exist
ing student organizations. Both
and the rest of us and we think that the student body deserved

Number of females falls

as winter term begins

By UNEEDA STUFF

If you are feeling the slowdown
of the Winter Term, this does
not necessarily mean that you
are a manic-depressive. Besides
the gloomy weather, the drop
in the female population of the
neighboring girls’ schools could
have a great deal to do with
your doldrums.

Hollins is still a nice place to
visit in the winter despite the
fact that nearly 50 percent of
the girls enrolled there are not to
be found on campus these days.
The missing girls are not all
escaping to the University of
Virginia—instead they are off
campus, working on independent
study programs and special pro-
jects. This year about 511 Hollins’
ladies remain on campus while
almost 420 have disappeared to
distant locations.

If the drop in numbers at Hol-
lins College sounds depressing in
itself you should keep in mind
that those girls who remained
behind did so in hopes that W&L
men would be here to show them
a good time.

At Sweet Briar the decrease in
the number of females on camp-
us has also dropped but not
so dramatically as is the case
at Hollins. However, the damage
should not be underestimated.
Sweet Briar has 452 students en-
rolled in regular on-campus
courses. Most of the other mem-
bers of the student body number-
ing 680 are away from Amherst
doing independent studies and
internships.

Mary Baldwin in Staunton al-
so allows its students to leave
during the January term but the
effect here is not devastating. Of
almost 600 girls enrolled there
only 80 are spending their short
term off campus. Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College does not
have a special term in the winter
and therefore all girls enrolled
were to return last Monday.

Certainly the female popula-
tion has declined in comparison
to that of the preceeding term
but things are not in dire straits.
If you can make it through the
present month relief will return
and just in time for Fancy Dress.

Nuckols prefers an all-male W&L

Editor’s Note: The following is
the second half of an interview
with the new Rector of the Board
of Trustees, E. Marshall Nuckols.
The interview questions were
telephoned to Mr. Nuckols who
returned his answers by mail to
the editor.

Q. We understand that you have
set up a committee to study co-
education as a possibility for
Washington and Lee. Please ex-
plain what has been done on this
and what remains to be done in
this connection.

A. At its meeting in May, the
Trustees authorized the Rector
to appoint a committee to study
the matter of co-education. The
Board specified, however, that
the Committee's responsibility
was to be one of fact finding
only and that the study was not
to be interpreted as pro or con
on the feeling of the Board of
Trustees in connection with co-
education. The appointment of
this Committee had been recom-
mended by the Board's Executive
Committee in order to determine
what affect, if any, the question
of co-education may have on the
ability of Washington and Lee
to retain its position as a unique,
independent, private university

This subject is one with which
the Board has concerned itself
periodically over a considerable
number of years. An extensive
study was prepared several years
ago by the University staff work-
ing in cooperation with a num-
ber of faculty members and stu-
dents. This study has been con-
sidered at length by the Trustees.
The new Committee will among
other things attempt to update
the facts developed in the earlier
study.

This Committee has now been
appointed under the Chairman-
ship of Trustee Frank C. Brooks.
It has not yet had an opportunity
to begin its study and probably
will not complete its review of
the essential facts before the May
1975, meeting of the Trustees at
the earliest.

Q. What do you believe are the
sentiments of the Board on co-
education at this point? What
are your own views on the de-
sirability of introducing co-edu-
cation here?

A. If the members of the Board
could have their “druthers” most,
if not all, probably would vote to
keep Washington and Lee an all
male school at the undergraduate
level. It is recognized though

DEAR TRAVELLER—1I can't find anything in that Greek labryrinth
they call McCormick Library. Can you clue me in as to some of
the latest in books and other materials now offered in the library,
and where can I find this stuff?

DEAR M

(Signed) M. Leech

-Yes, trying to find a book in the W&L library is a bit

like looking for a lacrosse jock in the classroom. However, fret
not. McCormick has many treasures well worth the three hours
it may take to locate them (provided members of the W&L student
body have not borrowed the books without checking them out,
as another variation upon that theme known as the Honor Sys-

them).

Here are just a few of those treasures:

The Sensuous Professor by “s". Yes, the one you've all been

Dormitory Counselors

Applications are invited for the personality characteristic believ-

positions of Freshman and
Upperclass Dormitory Counselors
for the 1975-76 academic year.
These positions are considered to
be among the most responsible
entrusted to Washington and Lee
students.

On the basis of past experi-
ence, certain guidelines for the
selection of Dormitory Counsel-
ors have been established. Ap-
plicants must be at least current
sophomores, and should not have
routine commitments after 8:00
p.m, that would normally take
them from the dormitory for any
appreciable time. While coun-
selorships are not awarded on
an academic basis, a student who
has failed to maintain a 2.0 aver-
age would probably not be select-
ed. Any counselor who is placed
on Academic Probation after be-
ing selected will be asked to re-
Sieh.

In order to insure their great-
est possible availability to coun-
selees, counselors are provided
a single room in the dormitory
and with the dinner meal, which
they are expected to eat in Evans
Dining Hall. Each counselor will
also be expected to live in his
dormitory room seven nights a
week and CANNOT HAVE OR
SHARE THE RENTAL ON AN
OFF-CAMPUS APARTMENT.

The primary basis for selection
of counselors to freshmen will
be their general fitness to aid in
making the dormitories a suit-
able environment for a student's
freshman year. Each applicant is
encouraged to obtain from the
Secretary to the Dean of Stu-
dents a copy of a statement more
particularly describing the goals
of our counseling system, the

ed desirable of a counselor and
the skills we hope a counselor
will posses or be able to develop.
STUDENTS WHO ARE PRES-
ENTLY DORMITORY COUN-
SELORS and who wish to re-
apply for next year should sub-
mit LETTERS to this effect to
the Office of the Dean of Stu-
dents by 4:00 p.m. on MONDAY,
JANUARY 27. In addition, re-
turning counselors should indi-
cate in their letter if they wish
to apply for Head Counselor or
Assistant Head Counselor.

N E W APPLICANTS FOR
COUNSELOR POSITIONS in
the freshman and upperclass
dormitories should submit letters
to this effect to the Office of the
Dean of Students by 4:00 p.m.
on MONDAY, JANUARY 27.
Such leters should indicate any
previous counseling experience
and the reason(s) for wanting
the position. Further details con-
cerning duties and responsibili-
ties can be obtained from Har-
rison Turnbull, Head Dormitory
Counselor, and Will Brotherton,
Kenny Mashburn, Lanny Rainey
and Tom Ramey, Assistant Head
Dormitory Counselors, each of
whom is a member of the Selec-
tion Committee. All applicants
for counselor positions will be
interviewed by a committee com-
posed of the Head Dormitory
Counselor and the Assistant
Head Dormitory Counselors.
There is a possibility that an
additional interview will be con-
ducted by selected members of
the Office of the Dean of Stu-
dents and other administrators.
Applicants will be notified by
mail of the time for interviews
after January 27.

Defense keeps Generals rolling
stuns Navy, 54-47, in 3-1

Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball Generals saw their seven-
game winning streak snapped
Saturday, but not before they
had again flexed their defensive
muscles to record one of their
biggest wins in recent years.

W&L stopped All-American
candidate Mickey Hampton cold
en route to a 54-47 win over the
Midshipmen Wednesday before
the largest home crowd of the
1974-75 season.

The previous night the Gen-
erals got clutch foul shooting
from sophomore Kim Sims in
the final two minutes to hold
off VCAA foe Bridgewater, 60-
57.

The victory streak came to an
end Saturday in Baltimore as the
Generals fell behind early and
could not come all the way back

The on-court proposal by one
W&L student to a Bridgewater
cheerleader was the highlight of
Tuesday's game, far outshining
the often sloppy play of the Gen-
erals and Eagles.

Neither team took solid con-
trol of the game in the first half
until W&L ran off six straight
points late in the half to take a
30-26 lead.

With Norm Kristoff and John
Podgajny leading the way, the
Generals increased their margin
to as many as 10 points midway
through the second half, 48-38.

son for the Generals, who earlier
in the week had recorded a 22-

Schweizerhof's match against

make the difference in the meet,

The Generals came within one
match of beating Duke, as wins
by Ford and Bill Cole (190) had
rallied W&L to an 18-18 tie.

But Pulleo, a strong contender
for the NCAA heavyweight title
the past two years, put Schweiz-

the match to give Duke the win.

Knipp, Overdorff, Crytzer,
Ford, and Cole were winners for

A tale

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

It was 12:40 in the afternoon,
January 11, 1975 I found myself
in the world of bigtime college
basketball.

Seven hours later, only the
game remained the same, as two
teams squared off in a matchbox-
sized gym for little more than
the fun of it. It was quite a
transition to make—from a game
for fame and many dollars to one
for a good time.

In Cole Field House that after-
noon I was an anonymous as
a hot dog concessionaire—in a
crowd of more than 13,000 fa-
natics, only the 6’9” or above
beanstalks stand out.

But that evening I couldn't
help but feel that even though
the team I was covering was on
the road, I knew the few in
attendance as if they were long-
time friends.

The Maryland-Wake Forest
game, played in the “bigtime”
world, wasn’t missing any of the
ingredients that make such bas-
ketball bigtime.

There was the national coach-
of-the-year, Norm Sloan of North
Carolina State, on hand to size
up his Wolfpack’s next opponent
while trying to figure out just
how Wake did beat State.

There was a full television
crew on hand to bring East
Coast viewers another ACC game
of the week.

simply beaten by W&L.

Once the Generals got the lead
midway through the first half
they never gave it up, and the
only serious threat the Middies
made late in the contest was
stopped by more clutch free
throw shooting by W&L.

Podgajny, whose deadeye shoot-
ing in the first half was the
spark W&L needed to move in
front, went four-for-four from
the charity line in the final two
minutes, while Greg Croghan
added a pair of free throws which
helped the Generals put the
game away.

“The defense was the key,
there’s no doubt about it,” said
a happy W&L coach Verne Can-
field after the game. “It’s been

our strong area all year long, and
if ever we needed it, tonight was
the night.”

The Generals’ team defense
was superb, as the tight man-to-
man coverage forced the Middies
to rely on outside shooting
throughout the game.

But the key to the W&L win
might have been the defensive
job done on Hampton, Navy’s
floor leader and leading scorer.

The 6’2” guard, who entered
the game with a 16.0 scoring
average, had only a missed free
throw in the scorebook to show
for his efforts.

Canfield rotated Sims, Pod-
gajny, Bowman Williams, and
freshman Bob Forlenza through-
out the game to guard Hampton,
assuring a fresh man to guard
the Middies’ most dangerous
player.

“Hampton did a lot to stop

of two worlds

There were the many news-
paper, radio, and television re-
porters, including a_ favorite
target for sports and television
editors this past fall, ABC’s Don
Tollefson, who roamed the side-
lines at many college football
game to uncover such important
stories as the history of Bermuda
grass and the reasons behind
Miss High School Homecoming’s
marriage to the second string
tight end for Georgia Tech.

There were freshmen like
Maryland's Brad Davis and Wake
Forest's Rod Griffin, whose tal-
ents were evidence enough to
show why NCAA recruiting viola-
tions may occur.

There were fan incantations of
“You *!?*, ref,” which, after a
call went the Terps’ way, chang-
ed only to “You still *!?*, ref.”

It was bigtime college basket-
ball all right, complete with tele-

vision timeouts, cheerleader
routines set to pep band music,
personalized towels for the Wake
Forest players, a Lefty Driesell
temper tantrum, and a final
“Amen” sendoff for the Deacons
when the host ‘Terrapins had the
game in the bag.

There weren't any great mobs
flocking to the University of
Baltimore Academic Center to
see the Super Bees host Wash-
ington and Lee, as had been the
case in College Park earlier in
the day.

Note that—Academic Center.
Not Field House or Arena or

It was back to the world of
basketball as I had come to know
it over the past two and one-half
years. Basketball for the fun of

overs.

Podgajny led W&L_ scorers
with 14 points. Navy’s Bill Mont-
gomery led all scorers with 15.
while Bob Burns and freshman
Hank Kuzma added 12 and 11
each,

The win ran W&L’s win streak
to seven, and raised their record

vania, Auburn, and Minnesota.

Among Verne Canfield’s pre-
game words to his players be-
fore the Baltimore game was a
warning that the Bees, in the
midst of a disappointing season,
might blow the locker room door

down en route to their meeting
with the Generals.

Though the door remained on
its hinges, the hosts did exactly
what Canfield feared—came out
fired up and stuck it to W&L
early.

Baltimore jumped out to a 12-
2 lead as the Generals couldn't
find the basket in the first five
minutes. The Bees increased their
lead with several fast breaks to
as Many as 22 points in the first
half before the Generals could
cut the margin to 36-18 at half-
time.

The Bees continued their
domination in the opening
minutes of the second half, and
for a while it looked like a rout
was in the offing, as Baltimore
opened up a 25-point lead with
15:14 remaining.

Is the game still the same?

(Continued from page 3)

The basketball floor was found
two flights up. No one could be-
lieve it. Third floor. Oh well, it’s
only a game.

The only coaches in attendance
were those whose teams were in
action. No television crew, just
a two-man radio team who piped
the game back to Lexington, Vir-
ginia, to be aired over a 10-watt
FM station.

Only one newspaper reporter
(myself) was there. There were
no obnoxious fan incantations,
no TV timeouts, and things of
that like.

And no Don Tollefson to tell
viewers about the uniqueness of
the game being played on the
third floor of the building.

It was a game played in the
highest of competitive spirits,
with little more on the line than
the ability to say “We won the
game,” when it was over.

There wasn’t a lot of alumni
pressure to win, nor were there

Not to say this was the case

fold, proceeding to stage a furi-

minutes. With Podgajny and

and a tenacious zone press forc-
ing BU into several turnovers,
W&L outscored the Bees 28-10

But Baltimore showed they
had a bit too much for W&L

the press with fullcourt passes

other hand, I am convinced the
Board must keep an open mind
and review all of these questions
from time to time as circum-
stances change. We certainly
should wait until the facts are
all in before reaching any con-
clusions.

Q. We have been told that you
are one of the better Charleston
dancers on the East Coast. Would
you care to elaborate on your
accomplishments?

A. President Huntley apparently
has been spreading this rumor.
If I have any accomplishments in
this area it is simply because I
grew up at a time when the
Charleston was the popular
dance. That says a great deal
about my age. In any event,
whether accomplished or not, I
enjoy giving it an occasional try.

Preparations for ‘76 Convention

(Continued from page 1)
tion between the state delega-
tions and the central division of
the committee. The nationwide
polling services will be used to
a greater extent next year than
in past mock conventions.

Perhaps most importantly of
all, the Credentials Committee is
compiling a list of possible con-
tacts it can make with state and
national politicians. The crucial
New York and California pri-
maries will occur after the Mock
Convention, thus adding too
much uncertainty to the proce-
dure, unless direct information is
available. Furthermore, the 1976
Democratic convention has the
potential to be a brokered con-
vention; that is, one where the

major decisions will be made in
ante-room caucuses, Since there
is a strong possibility of this oc-
curring, participants in W&L’s
convention will desperately need
personal, direct contacts with the
real delegates in order to predict
the outcome with any accuracy.

The other committees have
also been engaged in initial plan-
ning. The Parade Subcommittee
has a basic budget of $1000 that
it has been working with — more
money will be raised later. Plans
for the ‘Journal’, the official
publication of the convention, in-
clude comprehensive articles on
the candidates, a history of past
mock conventions, as well as the
schedule of events for the Con-
vention Weekend.

Fancy Dress

By Phi News Staff

Fancy Dress, Washington and
Lee’s most “elegant” tradition,
will devote its 1975 festivities to
a salute to the Swing Era. Em-
ploying the theme, ‘In the Mood,
1941,” the weekend’s activities,
which will run from Thursday,
February 20 to Sunday, Febru-
ary 23, will be highlighted by
Friday night’s 68th annual
Fancy Dress Ball, featuring the
music of the Stan Rubin Swing
Band and Dance Orchestra.

According to Student Activi-
ties Board chairman John Kill-
pack, the idea for the theme of
the Swing Era came last spring
when the current trend was a
nostalgic look back to the 30’s
and 40's. “The theme seemed to
fit well then,” stated Killpack,
“and we decided that we wanted
to go back a little more tradi-
tionally.”

The 1975 Fancy Dress activi-
ties will commence on Thursday
night, when Bill Deal and the
Rhondells will perform at Zoll-
man’s Pavillion. The time for

ODK initiations
take place on
Founders’ Day

By RYLAND OWEN

The combination Founders’
Day—Omicron Delta Kappa Con-
vocation was held last Monday
in Evans Dining Hall before an
audience of students, faculty and
alumni.

For the Founders’ Day cere-
monies President Huntley ad-
dressed the audience on the state
of the university. According to
Huntley, there are those who feel
the university dwells too much
on the past while others feel
there is too much emphasis on
the future; in response to these
ideas Huntley maintained,
“Washington and Lee stands at
a proper balance between past
and future.”

(Continued on page 4)

the party will be announced at
a later date and the admission
price will be included in the total
cost of Fancy Dress.

The highlight of Fancy Dress
weekend wlil, of course, be the
Fancy Dress Ball, which will be
held on Friday night at 8:30 in
the Early Fielding Student Cen-
ter, as well as Evans Dining Hall.
“What we're basically attempting
to do,” explained Killpack, “is
to recreate a 40’s nightclub, The
Starlight Club.” The ball will
include many different activities
ranging from a comedian in the
cockpit to the Stan Rubin Or-
chestra.

The Rubin band, which will
perform in the dining hall, fea-
tures not only the hits of the
swing era, but will also include
many popular hits of today. In
addition, Rubin will feature a
five piece Dixieland band which
will play the original Dixieland
jazz. The 13 piece Rubin Swing
Band and Dance Orchestra is
appearing for the fourth time at
a W&L Fancy Dress. The New
York band has previously appear-
ed in 1963, 1964, and 1965.

In the Cockpit, New York
comedian Kenny Kramer will
entertain guests, while other
activities around the Student
Center will include movies, a
small student combo, and more
entertainment soon to be an-
nounced. The ball will end at
1:00 a.m. and liquid beverages
will be included in the admission
price.

In addition, the SAB has an-
nounced that the entire Student
Center will be wallpapered blue,
and the ceilings will all be lined
with tiny white lights, which will
supply the only lighting. Furth-
ermore, the decorations will in-
clude potted palm trees and other
items that will add to the mood
of the swing era.

The weekend's other activi-
ties will consist of a grain party,
sponsored by the freshman class,
on Saturday afternoon at Zoll-
man’s Pavillion. Also, many fra-
ternities will be holding combo
parties, most likely opened to all

‘Critical Decisions Facing America’

By STEVE YEVICH
Phi Feature Editor

“Contact,” the annual sym-
posium designed to expose stu-
dents to issues of current signi-
ficance, will be sporting a few
changes this winter.

More emphasis will be placed
upon the original goal of pro-
viding a series of lectures that

$1.5 million donation received;
science hall named for Parmly

A $1.5-million gift to the en-
dowment of W&L has been made
by Miss Ruth Parmly of New
York City in honor of her father,
the late Charles Howard Parmly.

In recognition of the gift, the
university has named its engi-
neering, physics and biology
building, until now simply known
as the “New Science Building,”
Parmly Hall. A formal dedication
will be held later in the year.

The announcement was made
Monday by President Huntley at
a convocation marking Founders’
Day, Robert E. Lee's birthday,

and Omicron Delta Kappa intia-
tion.

The income from Miss Parmiy's
gift will be used to support
W&L's academic program in the
field of science and to continue
strengthening faculty salaries in
those departments.

Miss Parmly’s generous gift to
W&L is one of the largest in its
history, and brings to $27.2-mil-
lion the amount raised to date in
its development program for the
decade of the 1970s. That total
represents 75% of a $36-million
initial goal for 1976.

Professor Parmly taught phys-
ics and engineering at the Col-
lege of the City of New York
from 1888, the year of his gradu-
ation from that institution, un-
til his death in 1917 at the age
of 48.

He was the founder of CCNY's
engineering school, having spent
several years planning it in de-
tail. The CCNY board of trustees
approved his proposal and named
him its first professor and chair-
man only four months before his
death.

Though he spent his entire
professional career at City Col-
lege, Prof. Parmly was, in Hunt-
ley's phrase, “manifestly the kind
of man who today gives this uni-
versity its enduring strength
an extraordinarily effective
teacher of undergraduates.

“There can be no more fitting
tribute to Charles Howard
Parmly and to the standard of
education his life reflected— and
which we seek also to reflect
than the dedication of our engi-
neering, physics and biology
building to his memory

In addition to the announce-
ment of Miss Parmly's gift by
President Huntley at the Found-
ers’ day ceremonies here, a
special announcement of the gift
was made to the “Achievement
Council the volunteer leader-
ship organization which has re-

supplement the classroom. While
not critical of their predeces-
sors’ performance, the current
co-chairmen, Ben Sherman and
Bob Wyckoff, feel that “Contact”
has become too entertainment-
oriented in recent years and not
very substantive.

It is hoped that this year's
theme, “Critical Decisions Pac-
ing America,” will bring the
symposium back toward its goal,
as stated in the Student Hand-
book, of “offering the interested
student ‘contact’ with ideas and
issues that are of contemporary
interest, educational in nature,
and beyond the normal scope of
any department or course offered
by the University.”

The topic chosen was derived
from the name of the commis-
sion Vice President Nelson Rocke-
feller established upon resigning
as governor of New York. “It
seemed appropriate, said Sher-
man, “as the United States ap-
proaches its bicentennial, for
“Contact” to use such a theme,
dealing as it does with problems
of growing intensity.” These
problem areas include govern-
ment, economy, the legal sys-
tem, environment, and credibility
of the press.

The speakers who are sched-
uled to appear on campus be-
tween Feb. 25 and March 10 in-
clude; William Rukeyser, mod-
erator of “Wall Street Week"
on the National Educational
Television Network and author
of “How to Get Rich on

quist, Associate Justice of the

speaker had cancelled his engage-
ment. No one who had previosuly
said he would come has can-
celled; however, Dr. Daniel Boor-
stin and Rogers C. B. Morton,
who were tentatively scheduled
to appear, have had to abandon
their plans to attend. The Uni-
versity’s semi-annual calendar of
events lists the two gentlemen as
definitely coming to Lexington,
however, and so the rumor was
started.

The committee members are
still working feverishly to sched-
ule a debate between Brower and
an as-yet-unnamed spokesman
for the public utilities. A debate
would provide an unusual op-
portunity for students to hear
both sides of the “environment
versus industry” argument ad-
dressed.

Sherman and Wyckoff hope to
provide extra opportunities for
small group discussions with
other speakers. For example,
Rukeyser would attend an open
Commerce Fraternity meeting,
Justice Rehnquist would meet
with the Tucker Law Forum, and
Brower could speak to the Out-

ing Club. These and other in-
formal discussions will be held
if schedules permit, and would
be in addition to the traditional
Bookstore appearances, fratern-
ity cocktail parties, and post-lec-
ture receptions.

Another project that was initi-
ated this year was the ex-
hibit in the Student Center dur-
ing Parents’ Weekend. This dis-
play was shown in the hopes
of stirring interest and support
for the program among parents.

A less important change for
the coming lectures will be more
variety among the students who
introduce guest lecturers. In the
past it has been customary for
the co-chairmen to deliver the
opening remarks each evening;
this year other members of
“Contact” will be given a chance
to ascend the rostrum.

As it now stands, “Contact has
slightly over $8800 with which to
work, Of this, $3000 came from
the Interfraternity Council,
$4800 from the Student Execu-
tive Committee, and $1000 in
contributions from parents and

|REVIEW and OUTLOOK
The Automatic Rule

The Automatic Rule has been in effect at least since the
1930's but that is not really a good reason for keeping it now.
The goals of the Rule are understandable but the means em-
ployed toward its ends could stand some reevaluation. Ac-
cording to the Catalogue of Washington and Lee, the Rule
is designed to insure that the student will make the expected,
minimal progress toward attaining a degree within the pre-
scribed time. All it really does is weed out those students who
cannot meet its yearly grade average requirements—in many
cases, perhaps prematurely,

 

A freshman is expected to have a grade point average of
1.5 at the end of his first academic year. However, the student
must only achieve a 1.9 on all work attempted to graduate.
A freshman who falls under the Automatic Rule at the end
of the academic year is denied the chance to bring his average
up to an acceptable level, unless an exception is made, It
appears that the Automatic Rule says that such progress can-
not be made when it seems well within the realm of possibility.

We do not mean to suggest that all requirements for
graduation be dropped but we do feel that the rule that each
student realize at least a specific grade average at the end
of each academic year should be reconsidered, It seems a bit
too harsh and too “automatic.”

In place of an Automatic Rule we would suggest a more
lenient system. Perhaps a student could be asked to leave after
three 12-week terms on academic probation rather two as is
now the case. The largest group of students falling under the
Automatic Rule is from the freshman class and we feel that
freshmen need at least a second chance after their first year
away at college.

Washington and Lee should remember that its responsibility
should be to do everything in its power to keep its students
here without lowering its own standards significantly. We feel
that there must be a happier medium between the school’s
responsibility to its students and to its standards than the
Automatic Rule,

Get Ready

The plans of the Student Activities Board for Fancy Dress
Weekend, which are described on page one, promise one of
the biggest and best celebrations in the history of that event.
The SAB has worked long and strenuously to make this year’s
Fancy Dress more than just a revival of a traditional winter
weekend, Its ambitious plans should provide a spectacle which
rivals, if not surpasses, the splendor which made Fancy Dress
at Washington and Lee the social event of the east coast in
its heyday. We wish to remind the student body that Fancy
Dress is coming and is only weeks away. Get ready!

Roaring

Editor's Note: The article which
follows is reprinted from Volume
LXVII, Number 40, appearing on
March 19, 1968. It was one in a
series of articles printed in the
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi on the
newspaper's history and one we
feel worthy reprinting. The
writer was Reeve W. Kelsey.

“Educationally your Alma Mater

“Educational your Alma Mater
seems on the eve of a great de-
velopment. The air of the campus
is vibrant with optimism and
enthusiasm. Overflowing num-
bers, entire harmony, athletic
success, freedom from misbe-
havior and disorder and college
spirit—all these combine to make
from the educational standpoint
a happy present and a bright
future,”

Thus wrote Henry Louis Smith,
W&L’s seemingly eccentric presi-
dent of the “Twenties,” on Page
Three of the January 13th, 1920,
Alumni Edition of the Ring-tum
Phi. As a matter of fact, Smith’s
incessant writing of letters to
be published in the Ring-tum
Phi appears to today’s reader to
be quaint and amusing.

Impoverished Condition

Smith moved on and outlined
the impoverished condition of the
University’s finances: “Its tiny
endowment equals only $1,500 per
student, instead of the $6,400
which is now the average of
colleges of its type... Financi-
ally she is facing dire emergency.”

Smith finished his message
with a plea to the alumni: “The

’20’s similar to present

Alumni of Harvard, Yale, Prince-
ton, Dartmouth, Cornell, Leland
Stanford are all rallying to their
imperiled institutions with a
magnificent zeal, a unanimous
self-sacrifice, a record-breaking
liberality.”

“Let the Alumni of our historic
institution see to it that in this
unexampled financial emergency
their Alma Mater shall not be
crippled in her great work for
the lack of adequated financial
support, that her energies shall
be released to answer the call of
her great opportunity, and that

even more in the future than in
the past she shall be the South’s
most fruitful nursery of America’s
leadership.”

The more things change, the
more they stay the same...

The newspaper also reported
that Rupert N. Latture had re-
ceived “the Croix du Guerre for
calmness and devotion to duty”
while serving in France during
the first World War. A list of
those honor roll students was
published, and among those on
the list was the name of Fitz-
gerald Flournoy.

The Ring-tum Phi's greatest
crusade of the year was to resur-
rect the Southern Collegian. The
January 27 editorial said, “If the
typical old Southern Collegian is
a bit too heavy for the campus
of today to absorb, then replace
it by a magazine modeled on
Life.’ The editorial exhorted the
EC to pass the necessary legisla-
tion.

The battle continued when the
EC passed the following resolu-
tion: “Resolved: That the Editor
of the Ring-tum Phi is hereby

DEAR TRAVELLER—What is “the top” at Washington and Lee,

and how does one get there?

(Signed) Murph

DEAR MURPH—I presume you're either referring to the honor
organizations or else to the more exclusive group of those stu-
dents who have taken five physical education courses without
getting Coach Lord for at least one of them. I will assume the

former.

There are a number of organizations on campus which are
considered to be “the top.” These include “Who's Who,” “ODK,”

and “Friends of the EC.” Being a member of the last of

is a prerequisite to getting into the other two. Z
How does one get there? A tough question. To reach

it takes intelligence, charm, reliability, hard work, and a

wit, That leaves out the C-school. Five-dollar bills slipped quietly

 
  

under the door of those who select the membership don’t hurt,

either.

An easy way to get elected into these elite organizations is to
attain an office of high visibility within any of the various stu-
dent organizations. You can run unopposed for the EC, for
example, or you can vote for those running unopposed for the
EC and then have them appoint you to a student organization.

Once you are elected or appointed, your troubles are over.
Don't worry about doing anything. That's about the last thing

on the list of prerequisites for

these honor organizations. The

important thing is that you are in these posts, whether you do
anything or not, It's reported that both ODK and Who's Who
waned to induct Elmer Klassen, but the forms they mailed him

never got there.

What positions are shoe-ins for these organizations? Anything
on the EC. No matter what, you'll get in these organizations
eventually. If you can't get elected, get appointed. The Student
Activities Board is a start. Editor of the Phi usually doesn’t hurt,
although your chances here decline as your number of editorials

against the EC increase.

The important thing to remember is that it's not what you
do; it’s who you know, Remember, it’s not “Who's He?” or “(O)h,

(D)on't (K) now.”

DEAR TRAVELLER—What ever happened to streaking?

(Signed) H. Hefner

DEAR H.—Ah, fear not, it has yet to disappear from the W&L
campus. The C-School fraternity is planning a mass streak
around Dean Varner's desk sometime soon—whenever they can
figure out how to streak without taking off their khakis and

topsiders.

DEAR TRAVELLER—What ever
issue?

happened to the co-education

(Signed) The Board of Trustees

DEAR BOARD—Ah, fear not, it has yet to disappear from the W&L
campus. The EC is planning a mass co-education referendum
with polling places in the Co-op, the footbridge, and the corner
of Nelson and Main—whenever they can figure out that this

really is an all-male school.

restaurant in the near future.

But this article isn’t about Mrs.
Odell’s new resturant; rather it
is about the place it superceded:
the Picking Parlor.

It was a place without restric-
tions, it seemed, or maybe they
just never had any trouble with
the people who came in. The
farmers never seemed to mind the
students, and the townies and the
professors got along fine. And
more often than not, these people
mixed together at the same table,
bought each other beer, and
clapped and hollered to the music
together.

You weren't suppose to bring
beer in the Parlor, but buy it
there because they needed the
money. The Parlor had so little
money that they couldn’t pay
the musicians that came in to
play for the crowd. But the
musicians always came anyway,
as if they didn’t care about be-
ing paid. And someone always
took the time to move around
between the tables, squeezing be-
tween shoulders and backs, to
pass the hat.

If you were going to the parlor
for the second time you were
bound to see some familiar faces,
because there were a whole two
tables full of guys and gals that
were there every week. I remeber
once hearing these words when

a “regular” had failed to show
up last week:

“Where the heck were you last
week, Joe? We thought you were
dead or something.

“Why I was right here listen-
ing to every chord—what are you
talking about?

“If you were here last week
then J’m not sitting before your
eyes right now.”

“Well, if you ain't here, then
what you hollering at me for
skipping last week for?”

Somehow, as if some invisible
being was moving about quieting
everybody down, a hush would
settle in when the band was
ready to play. Once things were
quiet, Freddy would tighten a
few more ivory keys, reaching up
his banjo, or David would give

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor of the Phi:

I am writing this letter to
compliment you on your out-
standing editorial in last week's
issue of the Ring-tum Phi. You
have done a great service to the
entire W&L community in shed-
ding some light upon the grossly
irresponsible and illogical con-
duct of the S.A.B.U. and SAB.
members involved in the maniacal
negotiations for Black Awareness
Week. The very idea of using
funds from the Student Body
tax to support an activity which
eaters to a minority interest
group is enough to make me
retch!

It seems to me that this entire
affair has been characterized by
blatant discrimination against
every other minority interest
group on campus, be it racial,
political, religious, or whatever.
The S.AB. is entirely obligated
to co-sponsor the next function
of the W&L College Republicans,
the Young Democrats, the Saz-
eracs, etc,

This, of course leads us to the
controversy that evolved when
S.A.B.U. demanded Student Body
tax funds for the recruitment of
more Black students; how ab-

surd! If this isn’t discrimination,
what is? How many of you are
aware of the fact that a certain
percentage of the profits from
the sale of Law textbooks to
white law students are used to
provide FREE text books for the
Black law students at W&L?

Clearly some drastic changes
are in order; it is my sincere

Wé€eL’s Hudson moves to top

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

The accomplishments of fresh-
man swimmer John Hudson have
gone largely unnoticed outside of
these pages and the new pool in
Doremus Gym.

And it’s quite unfortunate, as
Hudson may be on his way to
achieving something no W&L
swimmer has ever done—win-
ning a national championship.

Through Sunday, the freshman
from Lancaster, Pa. had the top
times in the NCAA's Division III
in the 500- and 1000-yard free-
styles. In addition, Hudson was
in the top ten in the 200-yard
freestyle.

“He’s just a phenomenal swim-
mer,” said W&L swimming coach
Bill Stearns of Hudson. “He
works his tail off every day, and
obviously it’s paying off for him.”

Hudson has recorded times of
1:48.4 in the 200, 4:46.7 in the

500, and 9:55 in the 1000, all
school records. In practice, he
has bettered his time in the 1000
by seven seconds. His times in
the 500 and 1000 are also state
records.

Hudson has qualified for the
NCAA Division III championship
meet in all three events. He will
also team up with sophomore
Tad Van Leer and juniors Bill
Tiers and Rob Searles in the 800-
yard freestyle relay.

Van Leer has qualified in the
50-yard freestyle.

“We expect the Division III
meet to be tough, because a lot
of the California schools who
have good swimming teams have
gone Division III,” Stearns said.

The Division III meet will be
held March 20-22 in Meadville,
Pa., at Alleghany College.

Richmond tankmen top W&L

Freshman swimming sensation
John Hudson stole the show, but
Richmond's Spiders made off
with a 61-52 dual meet win
Saturday afternoon in W&L’'s
new pool.

Hudson, from Lancaster, Pa.,
broke the school, pool, and state
records in the 500-yard freestyle
with a 4:46.75 clocking. Hudson's
time was also the fastest record-
ed by a Division-III swimmer
this year.

Earlier in the season Hudson
had become number one nation-
ally in Division-III with a 9:48
clocking in the 1000-yard free-
style.

Hudson's accomplishment in
the 500-free Saturday was ac-
cented by the fact that he had
earlier won the 1000- and 200-
yard freestyles in back-to-back
order.

Sophomore Tad Van Leer add-
ed a double win for the Generals
in the 50- and 100-yard free-
styles.

Other W&L wins came from

Rod Scott in the 200-yard indi-
vidual medley, and from the
400-yard freestyle relay.

Richmond made its biggest
gains with 1-2 finishes in both
diving events and the 200-yard
butterfly.

The loss dropped W&L to 5-2,
while Richmond evened its rec-
ord at 3-3.

W&L is on the road this week-
end, with meets at Loyola of
Baltimore Friday and at Gettys-
burg College Saturday.

not because of the fracture in his

The 6'6” junior forward, who
averaged 14.5 points in the two
games he played in before being
injured, was set to return to
action this week until a doctor
told him he had contracted mon-

Through games of January 11,
the Generals ranked sixth de-

56.9 defensive points per game

The University of Chicago top-

average.

It should be noted that none
of the five teams ranked ahead
of W&L approached the Generals’
win-loss record of 9-2. Of course,
it’s now 11-2, and again, none
of the leaders come close.

Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball Generals rode their best
shooting game of the season to
an easy 98-67 win over Hamp-
den-Sydney Saturday afternoon
in a Virginia Collegiate Athletic
Association game in Doremus
Gym.

W&L, now 11-2 on the year, hit
58.3% of their shots from the
field, marking their best effort
from the floor since the Lebanon
Valley game of 1974, when the
Generals connected on over 60%
of their shots.

Junior guard John Podgajny
led the scoring parade for W&L
with 22 points, all from the field.
Podgajny hit his first five shots,
and went on to miss only six of
17 attempts on the afternoon.

Center Norm Kristoff added
another strong performance with
18 points, 12 rebounds and four
blocked shots, while 6’9” sopho-
more Don Berlin came off the
bench to score 12 points.

All 11 Generals who played hit
the scoring column.

Dick Ponti led the Tigers with
19. points.

Generals Coach Verne Canfield
said despite the fact that Hamp-
den-Sydney scored over what
W&L opponents have been aver-
aging, his Generals had another
good defensive game.

“People forget that many of
our points were set up by steals,
forced turnovers, and things like
that,” Canfield said. ‘“‘We had to
play some good defense to get
those, that’s for sure.”

W&L led for all but two
minutes in posting their second
straight win. The Generals took
the lead for good at 4-2, then

Wrestlers triumph
at Davidson, 29-13

By LEE KECK
Phi Sports Writer

Sparked by victories in the last
five weight classes, Washington
and Lee's wrestlers grabbed their
fifth win against one loss, 29-13,
last Friday night in a dual meet
at Davidson.

Howard Knipp (118), co-cap-
tain Don Overdorff (126), Jim
Crytzer (158), Ray Smith (167),
co-captain Doug Ford (177), Bill
Cole (190), and Steve Schweiz-
erhof (Hwy.) all posted individ-
ual victories over the wildcats.

Coach Gary Franke cited sev-
eral good matches responsible
for the victory, “especially Over-
dorff’s one point (7-6) victory
which probably turned the meet
around in our favor and Ray

Smith's win in his first varsity
start of the season.”

Knipp, Crytzer, and Ford join-
ed Smith in the ranks of the un-
beaten, extending their records
to 6-0-0. Winning by pins for
the Generals were Ford and Cole.
Davidson forfeited the Heavy-
weight division.

Davidson managed only one
pin (126) all night. The rest of
their points came from a super-
ior decision at 142 and a victory
at 150.

W&L hosted Eastern Menno-
nite Tuesday and hosts Pembroke
College, VPI, and Western Caro-
lina in a quadrangular meet

dets travel to Doremus Gym for

Concerns of W&L
in the roaring '20’s
(Continued from Page 2)
advised that the Student Body
Executive Committee of Wash-~-
ington and Lee University has
no jurisdiction to voluntarily in-
stall any publication in the Uni-
versity as per the editorial ap-
pearing in the Ring-tum Phi on

March 9th.”

The world moved on .. . the
Department of Accounting was
created in the Commerce School.
The McCormicks gave the school
$200,000. The history department
announced a new course, “The
History of the World War.” Fin-
ally, as usual, the editor of the
Ring-tum Phi had his way and
the Southren Collegian was
scheduled to start the next year.
In a student-wide election Fitz-
gerald Flournoy defeated J. W.
Bower, 258-234, to become the
editor of the new magazine.

No Intoxicating Liquors

In one of the most surprising
moves of the year the junior
class and the 13 Club passed the
following resolution: “We, the
members of the Junior Class and
the 13 Club, pledge ourselves as
gentlemen that we will not take
a drink of any intoxicating
liquors five hours before the
spring dances or at any dance.”!!

The ubiquitous Ring-tum Phi
editor glowed, “It is sincerely
hoped that this will solve the
problem for all time of sober
dances at W&L—a _ condition
which certainly was not the case
at our last dance at least.”

On the fraternity scene the
chapters of Zeta Beta Tau and
Pi Kappa were formed; the
Troubs put on a Vaudeville pro-
duction; and the baseball team
challenged the likes of Amherst,
the University of Georgia, Au-
burn, the Naval Academy, and
West Point.

Thus closed the first school
year in the 1920’s. The battle
over The Collegian and the des-
perate need for Alumni support—
who would know it was 1920
instead of today?

THE RING-TUM PHI

EC holds town forums
on WéeL’s honor code

By JOE FITZGERALD

The Executive Committee is
holding open meeting in Lee
Chapel this week in hopes of
eliciting student opinion and
debate concerning the possible
need for revision of the honor
system. The meetings, scheduled
for Wednesday and Thursday at
7 p.m., will be chaired by E.C.
president Ben Bailey.

Although the E.C. members

will be present during most of
the discussion, they will “stay
out of it as long as possible”
according to Bailey. If discus-
sion is not spontaneous, Bailey
may attempt to stimulate debate
by reading comments from the
survey sheets circulated by the
E.C. this month.

The E.C. will review those
sheets at their meeting next Mon-
day, and hold further open meet-
ings next week if they are needed.

O.D.K. initiates 20 new members

(Continued from page 1)

The financial situation of the
university was also discussed,
with emphasis being placed on
the need for further contribu-
tions in order to keep up with
rising costs brought on by infla-
tion. Huntley pointed out tuition
would continue to rise unless the
amount of money received from
alumni and friends of the uni-
versity continues to increase.

Although W&L, like all other
private schools, has been affected
by inflation, Huntley concluded
that “few schools can find more
cause for optimism.”

interested alumni. Members of
“Contact” are trying to raise
additional funds, as each speaker
costs $1500-$1750, not including
programs, mailings and posters.
Sherman said that each year
about $1500 is customarily left
behind for the following year’s
symposium, and that this year’s
group would like to continue the
tradition.

A remembrance of the Pickin’ Parlor

audience was more than ready,
the musicians were about ready.
Danny Hull takes a couple of
picks at his dobro. Someone yells
“g5 0.” Freddy i tighten
another string. The musicians
are just about ready. The audi-
ence is too ready. Freddy gives
an eye check with Guy. Guy
puts his bow on the opening
string. The audience has been
hearing the music for the last
minute. Silence.

A long whine pierces the air,
followed by a shorter one, then
a longer one, then a faster one,
then an even faster one, as Guy
pumps faster and faster on his
fiddle, holding the piece of wood
tight with his chin and shoulder.
The tight-skin plucking of Fred-
dy’s banjo jumps in and biends
with the motion and the music.
Nodding turns into clapping, and
clapping evoles into stomping,
as Danny’s dobro becomes part
of the moving sound. Then every
few seconds you can hear clearly
deep voice of David’s bass fiddle
tying down the rising tempo to
a solid beat. The fierce fiddling,

Not counting the season open-
ing Tip-Off Tournament, in
which he played sparingly, junior
center Norm Kristoff has been
in double figures in all but one
game. Only Navy kept Kristoff
below 10 points, and, even then,
points weren’t needed by W&L
in the Generals’ best defensive
effort of the year... Kristoff is
currently the Generals’ leading
scorer with an 11.6 average, fol-
lowed by John Podgajny with
11.3 and Greg Croghan with a
10.2 average... W&L is outscor-
ing their opponents by an aver-
age of 12 points per game.

Go south on I-81 until you
reach the first Salem exit. Get
off I-81, then take a right at

Remember, the game is at the
Salem Civic Center. If you go to
the larger, newer Roanoke Civic

the circus. Take that as you will.

Satirical ‘Lion in Winter’ promised

Phi Staff Reporter

The Universiy Theatre’s pro-
duction of “Lion in Winter,” a
two-act play written by James
Goldman, opens next Monday
night, Feb. 3, at 8 p.m., and will
continue through Saturday, Feb.
8.

The play is directed by David
DeChristopher, a drama major at
W&L, as his senior thesis. De-
Christopher chose the text by
Goldman, who has written such
screenplays as “Nickolas and
Alexandra” and “They Might be
Giants,” because of his interest
in the basic principles of acting
and style which are reflected in
the play. He also found the depth
of character, as expressed in the
dialogue, challenging from a di-
rector’s point of view.

Be forewarned if you are ex-
pecting this production to resem-
ble the movie, which featured
Richard Burton and Katherine

Hepburn, The play is not set in
such a rich historical context —
the sets, designed by Walter Ro-
manchuk, are stark and sugges-
tive, but not grounded in reality.

The action revolves around a
meeting of the seven characters
during the Christmas of 1183, as
they attempt to decide how the
kingdom of the aging Henry II
of England (David Minton)
should be divided. The queen,
Eleanor of Aquitane (Marcia Wil-
son), favors her eldest son, Rich-
ard the Lionhearted( Dan Scott),
while Henry is inclined to let the
youngest son, John (Scott Win-
zeler), ascend the throne.

The middle son, Geoffrey (Jim
Overton), would “sell them all”
in his ambitions to become king,
and to placate him both of his
brothers promise him the posi-
tion of Chancellor in exchange
for his support of them. In addi-
tion, King Philip of France (Don

SAB, film committee
request EC funding

By JOE FITZGERALD

John Killpack of the Student
Activities Board and Ken Mash-
burn of the Film Committee ap-
peared before the Executive Com-
mittee Monday night to ask for
funds to cover unpaid bills in-
curred by last year’s Film Com-
mittee. The 1973-74 committee
left bills totalling $518 and Mash-
burn reported that paying the
money out of this year’s budget
would cause serious problems in
the Winter and Spring schedules.

The E.C. told Mashburn and
Killpack to “come back after
Fancy Dress,” in the words of
vice-president Bob Keatley. The
E.C. wants to wait and see if the
SAB can cover the committee's
expenses from the money taken
in from that weekend. The E.C.
would have to use money from
their Reserve Fund to cover the
bills and they are reluctant to
use that money unless someone
needs funds and cannot obtain it
from any other source.

Later in the meeting the E.C.
voted to give Bill Sturges of the
University Federation $150 from
their Reserve Fund to help spon-
sor the dance being held this
Saturday, Feb. 1, in Evans Dining
Hall.

The money was given with the
understanding that Sturges would
return $50 of it if he could get
enough from other contributors
to make up the difference.

The dance is being co-sponsor-
ed by the Federation. Pi Kappa
Phi fraternity, SAB and, as of
Monday night, the E.C. A bus is
coming from Hollins and girls are
expected from other colleges

Admission will be $1 for ladies
The price in-

and $2 for men

cludes all the beer one can drink.
All proceeds from the mixer will
go to the Federation's Winter
Clothing Drive.

In other business, the E.C.
heard a report from Jay DuRiv-
age of the Cold Check Commit-
tee. DuRivage reported that the
committee now has $327 in out-
standing debts; $200 of that
amount is owed by persons who
have graduated or left the uni-
versity and $118 of it is expected
this week.

DuRivage expressed his con-
cern over the large number of
checks bounced just before the
Christmas break. Bad checks had
averaged $20-30 a month until
then, but the committee has re-
ceived $312 since Christmas. He
said the committee expects the
same thing to happen after the
Spring break and at the end of
the year and that such an oc-
eurence could hurt the commit-
tee’s finances. The committee
may have to double fines to dis-
courage persons from passing
bad checks just before they leave
town.

Hogle) and his sister Alais
(Tama Natkin) are at court, and
their presence further compli-
cates negotiations.

The play is a collage of scenes
during which each character
maneuvers to consolidate his or
her position; no holds are barred
as each finds his or her proposed
course blocked by someone else.
Everyone except Alais, who is
also Henry's mistress, realizes
the mundane condition of his or
her experience and tries to rise
above it through burlesque and
sarcastic humor, but in the end
each fails.

“The language is exciting and
slick, and full of metaphor and
word play,” says DeChristopher.
“The play is very light, unlike
the movie, and in most cases
takes the conventional point of
view toward love, marriage, lon-
liness and _ lovelessness.” The
small size of the cast adds to the
intimacy of the production — the
spectacle that was apparent in
the cinema adaptation is replac-
ed by intense dialogue in what is
more of a character study than
an historically accurate play.

Curtain time each evening is
8 p.m., and reservations in ad-
vance are necessary. Reserva-
tions can be made by telephon-
ing the Theatre at 463-9111, ext.
273.

 

Dan Scott as Richard Coeur de Lion and Marcia Wilson as Eleanor of Aquitane rehearse for the Wash-
ington and Lee University Theatre's production of “Lion in Winter,” which opens Monday (Feb. 3)
jor a six-day run. The W&L Theatre's production of the 1966 James Goldman Broadway success is di-
rected by David DeChristopher, a drama major at Washington and Lee, as his senior thesis.

Student apartments to be ready
for occupancy next September

By HALE DELAVAN
Phi News Staff

By May 1, 1975, the campus
should see the completion of the
Woods Creek Apartments. Ori-
ginally scheduled for occupancy
by September, 1974, several prob-
lems arose that delayed construc-
tion.

A long period of bad weather
slowed the rate of construction
from the outset. Trouble obtain-
ing building materials and labor
crews also kept the contractor
from proceeding on schedule.

These problems have now been
solved and work is progressing
rapidly. According to the Univer-
sity, the furniture is already here
and ready to be put in place.
The apartments are designed to
house three to five students who
will share a common living room,
kitchen and dining room. The
entire building will be air-con-
ditioned, completely furnished
and carpeted. The units will be
assigned to students on a first-
come, first-served basis.
University officials hope that
the entire project will be financ-

Plans for Fancy Dress changed

By Phi News Staff

According to Student Activi-
ties Board chairman John Kill-
pack, Fancy Dress 1975 will in-
corporate several changes in the
events of the weekend which
will run from Thursday, Febru-
ary 20 to Sunday, February 23.

Killpack announced at Mon-
day's EC meeting that due to
misunderstandings over the book-

 

Ellen Stewart, producer of me 500 plays and executive director
/ La Mama Experimental Theatre Club of New York City, will
present a lecture and demonstration ‘Ol! to Broadway: Na-
tional and International Identity on Wednesday, February 5
at 4:15 { Troubadour Theatre. Her visit to campus is spon-
red by ft WEL ¢ department and the University Center

‘ j jn

ing, Bill Deal and the Rhondells
will not be performing on Thurs-
day night at Zollman’s Pavilion.
Instead, an effort is currently
being made to sign the Tams to
perform in place of the Rhon-
dells.

In addition, Champale will
be served at Friday night's Fancy
Dress Ball and will be included in
the total cost of the weekend. In
order to get an understanding of
what the Student Center is going
to look like when decorated, the
SAB is also currently attempting
to set up a room in the Student
Center that will resemble the
way the Center will be decorated
for the ball

Furthermore, the dress for
Friday night's ball is black tie
and students are encouraged to

dress as such. However, suits will
be allowed although sports coats
will not be. The SAB, in conjunc-
tion with the College Town Shop,
has announced that they will be
offering drastically reduced
prices on all tuxedo rentals for
Fancy Dress. The total price of a
tuxedo and accessories for the
ball will be $11. In order to pro-
mote the use of formal wear, the
College Town Shop is cutting its
rental costs on tuxedos for this
event only

At this time, the SAB is still
looking for interested students to
help them out in organizing the
weekend. All those interested can
contact John Killpack or any
SAB member or leave a message
in the SAB office in the Student
Center.

sponsor Evans mixer

Phi New staff

Do you like beer, bands, and
broads? And do you also like to
help out the needy people in the
area by having a great time?

Washington and Lee students
will be able to satisfy both of
ires by attending a mix-
er sponsored by the University
and Pi Kappa Phi
this Saturday night in Evans Din-

these de

ina Hall. There will be an ample
amount of free beer inside the
door. The music will be provided

by “Staircase.” a musically flex-
ible band from Charlotte. The
group plays soul, rock and roll,

and Top Forty songs
In addition there will be girls

there to keep everyone happy
Contingents will arrive by the
curload from the major girl

schools in the area. The sponsors
have made great efforts to ad-
vertise the mixer at these schools
and expect a large turnout of the
opposite sex

The price of admission will be
two dollars for men and one dol-
lar for each girl. The festivities
will begin at eight o'clock and
will last until midnight

The purpose for the mixer is
much more serious than the
mixer itself. Thanks to contribu-
tions by the E.C. and the SAB
all of the proceeds from the
dance will go towards the winte
clothing drive. The sponsors will
turn the money over to Rock
bridge area social services for
distribution to the many needy
children in the county

ed by the Virginia College Build-
ing Authority, a state agency es-
tablished two years ago. Its pur-
pose is to issue tax-free revenue
bonds for the financing of educa-
tional facilities at private institu-
tions. The advantage of the
VCBA program is that it gives
private institutions the same fi-
nancial opportunities open to
public institutions.

Steady progress has been made

toward finishing the complex
since October. With new crews
on the job, the apartments

should be ready for occupancy
by the beginning of the 1975-76
school year. Special rental pro-
cedures are in effect this year
owing to the tentative nature of
the completion date. Next year,
new procedures with regular
sign-up periods, binding rental
contracts and non-returnable re-
servation fees will be in effect.
There will be no charge in the
rental fees set up for next year:
$650 to $750 per student for the
academic year.

Most of the students in this
complex will have private bed-
rooms. However, of the 178 stu-
dents signed for occupancy, 32

will share their bedrooms. Re-
quests for places in the apart-
ments should be filed with Mr.
W.N. Mohler, Associate Director
of University Services, in Wash-
ington Hall 5.

Staff editorials

It will be our policy to allot space in our editorial columns,
from time to time, to staff members who have strong and
legitimate feelings on a topic with which they have become
familiar as a result of their work for the Ring-tum Phi,

It is the feeling of the editor that when a staff member has

developed a responsible editorial on a topic of concern, he
ought to be given the privilege of whatever “weight” the edi-
torial columns of this paper carry.

In all circumstances, the editor realizing he has final
responsibility for the content of the newspaper — will pass
prior judgment on the suitability of each draft “staff editorial ;”
and because they will almost always express points of view
differing somewhat from his own, these occasional editorials
will be distinguished by the appearance of their writer’s initials
at their conclusions.

SAB

Rambling through some old minutes of Executive Com-
mittee meetings, | came across a list of expenditures and re-
ceipts of the Student Activities Board as of January 20.

The film committee has spent $1,528 while collecting $2,527 ;
the University Center committee spent $1,367 while collecting
$2,664; and the entertainment (or lack thereof) committee
spent “only” (in the words of the EC minutes) $9,314 while
collecting $21,347. All receipts include moneys originally al-
located to SAB from the student body tax. The total leaves a
net reserve of more than $15,000 in SAB’s cash box, according
to the minutes of the EC.

Thus, some $12,000 of the student body’s money has been
spent. Where? Among the more memorable SAB functions of
last term were the many films (which actually did seem to be
reasonable and entertaining), a $5,000 dive known as the
Souther-Hillman-Furay Band and Dan Fogelberg (which
came on a Thursday night), a successful mixer-and-all-you-
can-drink-beer-affair (which seems like one of the few things
the SAB has done which is worth repeating, and which, of
course, won't be repeated), and a party co-sponsored with
Contact '75 for parents during Parents’ Weekend (which re-
ceived little, if any, publicity and which didn’t exactly focus
on the entertainment needs of the students).

Other than that, not much less, if there was anything else,
seems to stick in this columnist’s mind.

And all that cost this columnist, as an individual, about
nine dollars, not including the price of the films, the mixer, and
the concert.

| don’t think “all” that was worth three dollars, to me or
to anyone else on campus, save those on the SAB, maybe.

I've been waiting out this term before I start getting irate
at the SAB, waiting for, perhaps, another mixer-and-beer-
bash, or some really good flicks, or somethnig that appeals to
more than a small minority of the students on this campus.
Save for Fancy Dress, I see no such prospects in sight.

Thus, | await Fancy Dress. SAB has already condescended
to the rest of the students, allowing suits as well as tuxedos,
and SAB has even worked out a deal with the College Town
Shop where tuxedos can be rented for 11 bucks. Even though
it is being planned by SAB, Faney Dress looks promising.

The point is that this has been less than a stellar year for
SAB. Its accomplishments have been so few that even a per-
fect Fancy Dress will still leave a bad taste in my mouth about
leaving SAB in control of my student body taxes. Fancy Dress
mav be the best thing ever on this campus when it comes
around next month, but it certainly won't be worth the $35
| paid in student taxes (W hich will be what I am paying for
Fancy Dress, since the rest of the SAB functions this year
have been worthless). And, that $35 doesn’t even include the
$10 fee for the affair, along with dinner, tuxedo, ete.

And what would even bother me more is if a line | read in
the EC minutes is true—"“Killpack said that fraternities will be
able to buy tickets in blocks.” As an independent, | do not
particularly care to subsidize fraternities.

In conclusion, let me congratulate those on 5 \B—and on
the EC—who have made ODK and “Who's Who” this year;
these seem to be the only noteworthy accomplishments of

either this year,

Ask Traveller

DEAR TRAVELLER—I'm a freshman and my stock in Boone’s Farm
has plummeted. Am I still eligible for financial aid here?
(Signed) Merrill Lynch

DEAR MERRILL-—My initial advice is for you to dump your stock
and buy up some stock in a grain-alcohol firm before Fancy Dress
gets here. Whatever, the answer to your question is an unmistake-
able yes.

There is much in the way of financial aid in various forms at
Washington and Lee. Aid varies from the work-study program (which
itself ranges from explaining Doonesbury comics in Washington Hall
to polishing topsiders in the C-school to ordering finger paints for
the fine arts department) to the full scholarship, available to any
registered Whig from Botetourt County with a lisp who knows all
seven verses of ‘‘Dixie.”

The most popular of scholarships given at Washington and Lee
is the partial scholarship, so called because the university can’t af-
ford to pay all the tuition it charges, The partial scholarship is usu-
ally used to pay a portion of the student’s costs, such as part of tui-
tion, laundry, food, or gas to power his MG down to Hollins and back.
Actually, the partial scholarship is a nice way for the university to
say that it is aiding, say, 250 students at the university. This looks
good when the school appeals to the alumni for funds, as long as the
alumni don’t find out that the university has granted, say, 250 one
dollar partial scholarships.

But there are a number of scholarships listed in the back of the
catalogue which students perennially fail to take advantage of. Some
of these scholarships include:

       

—The H. John Ackerman Memorial Scholarship, This prestigious
award goes to any freshman who picks up a Southern Seminary date
at the BV porno flick and takes her back to his room, Stipend: a gift
certificate from Fiesta Prophylactics.

~The Douglas Schwartz Memorial Scroll, given in memory of co-
education, executive fiat, terminal diarrhea, and other issues last
raised on this campus by a hippie radical law student who wore suit
coats over blue denim shorts. Given to that freshman who most be-
lieves that he can really change the thinking of this campus.
Stipend: $15, and a year’s subscription to the Alumni Magazine.

—The Irving Fitzgerald Snodhappy Award, This coveted piece of
garbage goes to that upperclassman who best exemplifies apathy on
campus. Nominees must not participate in any activities on campus,
save perhaps the EC. Award: $25, and membership in “Who's He in
American Colleges and Delicatessens.

—The “I’ve Got a Secret” Award, given to the student who com-
mits the most Honor violations without getting caught. Friends of
the EC are excluded.

—The Commons Award for Excellence in Jello-chucking. This
award is a stipend of $50 and a broom, given to the student who dis-
plays the most talent, artistry, and accuracy in food-throwing in the
dining hall. Nominees are judged by the art department, with the
winning entry to be modeled in Art 103.

Prof. Jennings’ proteges make a movie:
the bloody ‘Texas Chain Saw Massacre’

Could a meek, mild-mannered
journalism professor inspire such
insanity as “The Texas Chain
Saw Massacre?”

The film, which recently ap-
peared at the Lyric Theatre, was
produced, written, directed and
performed by a group of Univer-
sity of Texas students. Some of
those students took part in a
seminar at the University of
Texas under Prof. John K. Jenn-
ings, now teaching in Washing-
ton and Lee’s Department of
Journalism.

“Aw, you really don’t want to
write anything about this, do
you? It’s just a couple of old
Texas boys having a little fun,”
says Mr. Jennings.

He says he knows of only two
students of his who participated
in the film. Danny Pear! direct-
ed the cinematography, and Ted
Michilou wrote the script, which
apparently contains more

screams and groans than any-
thing else.

Mr. Jennings says the film was
conceived and produced long af-
ter he left the University of
Texas to return to Washington
and Lee. He disclaims any sug-
gestion that his grading system
inspired the movie.

“The Texas Chain Saw Mass-
acre” is said to be based on a
true story. But nobody seems to
be able to think of what that
story may be. The film ad runs
something to the tune of “Who
will be left, and what will be left
of them?” Nice.

Mr. Jennings says he has not
yet seen the movie. He says he
won't ever see the movie, even if
it was produced by some former
students of his. He did not ela-
borate, but then, he didn't really
have to.

The film seems to be a radical
extension of the recent escapism

Exchange program

Washington and Lee will par-
ticipate again this year with six
other colleges (Hampden-Sydney,
Hollins, Mary Baldwin, Ran-

is designed primarily for juniors.
To be eligible to take part in this
program, a Washington and Lee
student must have a 2.00 cumula-
tive average on his work. A stu-
dent may participate in the Ex-

two schools fit, for a shorter per-
iod of time.

W@L freshman swimming sensation John Hudson

Swimmers win twice

Freshman John Hudson con-
tinued his assault on Washington
and Lee’s and Virginia’s state
swimming records as the Gen-
erals won a pair of dual meets
Friday and Saturday.

W&L had no trouble in down-
ing Loyola of Baltimore Friday,
§2-41. The Generals came back
the following afternoon to stop
Gettysburg College, 62-51.

Hudson set another school and
state record in the 100-yard free-
style against Gettysburg with a
9:51.8 clocking. The time was
more than three seconds better
than Hudson's old record set
against Old Dominion on Dec. 3,
1974.

Hudson's time gave him the
number one time in the NCAA-

Division III in the 1000, He also
holds the top time in the 500-

the 200-yard freestyle.

W&L coach Bill Sterans said
that the Loyola meet was a “fun
affair, allowing our swimmers to
go in events other than their us-
ual ones.”

Freshman Peter Botts Meem
scored the lone double win for
W&L, with victories in the 500-
and 1000-yard freestyles.

Sophomore Tad Van Leer took
a double win against Gettysburg
in the 50- and 100-yard free-
styles. Rob Searles, in the 200-
yard backstroke, and Gary Sel-
domridge, in the 200-yard breast-
stroke, also were winners for the
Generals on Saturday.

The wins upped W&L’s season
mark to 7-2. The Generals have a
pair of tough dual meets coming
up, with William and Mary on
Saturday at Williamsburg, and
against VMI on Wednesday, Feb-
ruary 5, in the new pool at 7 p.m.

Croghan has good week

WéeL stops Eagles;
shot down by Roanoke

ty BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

What would you do if you were
the coach of a basketball team
which was being victimized by
your opponent’s hottest shooting
night in five years? Would you:

1) Try to toughen up your de-
fense in hopes that it would, to
some extent, cool down the op-
position?

2) Join your foe in the run-
and-gun game and try to make
up the lost ground?

3) Stand around and wait for
your opponent to start missing
with more regularity?

Washington and Lee tried a
little of each Saturday against
Roanoke College, but found that
none of them worked as the Ma-
roons shot a blazing 64 percent
from the field in romping to a
102-83 win over the Generals in
the Salem-Roanoke Valley Civic
Center.

Earlier in the week, W&L had
rallied from a nine-point half-
time deficit to beat Bridgewater
College, 64-53 in a VCAA confer-
ence game, thus giving the Gen-
erals the lead in the Western Di-
vision.

W&L, now 3-0 in its division,
leads defending division champ
Madison by one full game. The
Generals and Dukes could be
playing for the division title in
the regular season finale on Feb-
ruary 22.

As for what occured last week:

Co-captain Greg Croghan’s
best game at W&L sparked the
Generals in their second-half
comeback to down the Eagles on
the losers’ home floor Wednes-
day.

The 6’3” senior from Annan-
dale, Va., threw in a season-high
19 points while adding 17 re-
bounds, many of them off the of-
fensive boards.

Croghan’s play in the first half
kept W&L in a ballgame which
Bridgewater threatened to break
wide open with some deadeye
outside shooting in the early go-
ing.

The Eagles’ backcourt of Ron
Simms and Ken Utterback hit on
their first six shots, and, before
anyone had worked up a sweat,
Bridgewater was on top, 12-2.

However, Bridgewater’s front
line got in foul trouble, and, with
66” center Tom Wright and for-
wards Bill Gardner and Dennis
Gibson on the bench for part of
the first half with three fouls
each, the Generals gradually
pulled within nine points at in-
termission, 35-26.

Then the game changed com-
plexions. After allowing more
than their defensive average usu-
ally called for, the Generals re-
turned to their aggressive style
of defense and stopped the
Eagles cold.

It took Bridgewater 5:10 to
score their first field goal of the
second half, and by that time,
W&L had pulled within 38-37.

By LEE KECK
Phi Sports Staff

After devastating Eastern Men-
nonite last Tuesday, Washington
and Lee's wrestlers suffered a let-
down, dropping two of three
matches in Saturday's quadrang-
ular dual meet in Doremus Gym.

Against Mennonite all but two
wrestlers won their individual
matches. Brian Tray (142) and
David Mintz (150) each manag-
ed superior decisions, 15-2 and
14-4. Steve White (190), in his
first match of the season, and
Steve Schweizerhof (Hwt) both
picked up pins 30 seconds into
the second period.

 

thee

 

The Generals started Satur-
day in good fashion by defeating
V.P.1., 28-9. They then lost to
Pembroke State College, 38-2,
and Western Carolina, 20-14. Ho-
ward Knipp (118), Don Over-
dorff (126), and Schweizerhof
gained two victories apiece to
lead the team.

The Generals team record now
stands at 7-3. Leading in indivi-
dual records are Knipp (9-1),
Jim Crytzer at 150 (8-1-1), Doug
Ford 167 (6-2), and Overdorff
(7-3). W&L’'s last home meet was
yesterday against V.M.I. The
team now travels to a tourna-
ment at Virginia State on Satur-
day and to the VCAA meet on
February 8.

The Generals kept up the pres-

Norm Kristoff doing the offen-
sive work, moved to a 10-point
lead at 55-45.

The Eagles then resorted to
fouls in an attempt to get the

hitting three one-and-one situa-
tions to ice the game for the

Roanoke’s All-American Ross
Robinson went wild against W&L
on Saturday, and his Maroon
teammates chipped in with some
out-of-this-worldness of their
own.

Robinson, forced to play sec-
ond fiddle to Jay Piccola for the
past two years, fired home a

career-high 37 points to lead
Roanoke to an easy romp over
the head-shaking Generals, who
couldn't believe what they saw.

“Awesome,” was the reply of
more than one W&L player when
asked what they thought about
Roanoke, and especially their
shooting ability.

Roanoke hit on 73 percent of
their field goal attempts in the
first half, and finished the game
with a 64 percent accuracy.

The Generals were never in
the game after Roanoke ran off
15 points in four minutes to take
a 21-13 lead. After that, it was
all Maroons.

Robinson missed only one shot
in the first half en route to 20
points by intermission, while his
running mates on the front line
Walt Reaves and Howard Ray
added 10 and eight each in the
opening half.

February vacation set

By RYLAND OWEN

The Washington holiday, de-
signed as a mid-term break, will
begin on Wednesday, Feb. 12, at
5:05 p.m., and classes will resume
Monday, Feb. 17.

Although there have been com-
plaints as to the wisdom behind
the planning of such a short holi-
day nothing can be done about
this year’s academic calendar.
According to David McLean,

Freshman Representative to the
University Council, the academic
calendar for 1974-75 has already
been approved by the UC and
nothing can be done about it this
year.

Next year’s calendar, however,
has been revised. In addition to
extending the Christmas break
to Monday, Jan. 5, the UC has
approved a ten-day Washington
holiday, from Friday, Feb. 13 to
Monday, Feb. 23.

Professor Gaughan’s son loses sled

(Continued from page 2)

he brought his sled along. He
found a good hill for sledding
along side duPont Hall.

In the early afternoon, he
stopped sledding for awhile to
build a snow man, When he went
back to use the sled, he found
that it had disapeared.

Eight year old boys are too
old to cry, and my son didn’t cry.

Even so, it was rather hard to
make him understand that some-
one would take his sled away.
Perhaps someone made a mis-

take. The sled is an “American
Flyer.” No official report of its
loss has been made. If the person
who has taken it will kindly re-
turn it to the front of the law
school, no questions will be asked.

E.C. seeks end to rules
for academic probation

By JOL FITZGERALD

The Executive Committee voted
Monday night to recommened to
the Faculty E.C. that all re-
strictions on activities for stu-
dents on academic probation be
removed. The vote was six to four
with one member abstaining and
one absent.

The vote was only a suggestion
and not binding on the F.E.C.
The F.E.C. had asked for input
from the E.C. as well as the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. The vote
will be reported at next week’s
F.E.C. meeting.

The motion to suggest no re-
strictions was put forth by E.C.
members Steve Robinson who
argued that “if you’re old enough
to go to college, you’re old enough
to handle your academic career.”
The four members who voted
againts the proposal agreed with
Everett Martin that “you need
some safeguard” against students
in elected positions ignoring their
responsibilities in trying to raise

their grades.

The present rules state that a
student may engage in only one
activity when he is on academic
probation, and must resign any
elective ov appointive office. Vice-
president Bob Keatley suggested
that if the F.E.C. heeded the sug-
gestion from the E.C. the E.c.
could pass their own rule con-
cerning members who shirked
duties to study.

In other business, the E.C.
heard from John Killpack of the
Student Activities Board concern-
ing more changes in Fancy Dress.
The beverage served at the Ball
on Friday night, Feb. 21, will
be beer instead of the Champale
announced earlier. In addition,
coat and tie will be minimum
dress for the event, but no khakis
or denim will be allowed.

The E.C. also held a meeting
Tuesday night to consider pro-
posals for change in the Honor
System. Although the public

for needy

William Sturges, president of
the University Federation, said
that in his opinion the mixer,
held in Evans Dining Hall, was
extremely successful and that
everyone appeared to be having a
good time, whether mingling
with the imports from down the
road or indulging in liquid re-
freshments.

The money raised by the event
will be used to aid the Rockbridge
Area Relief Association, the local
Welfare office, and the Lexington
Boys Club. Clothes will be bought
with the proceeds, foster homes
will be supported, and the gen-
eral fund of the Boys Club will be
augmented.

“Staircase,” the band from
Durham which played at the
mixer, seemed to be well receiv-
ed. The thirteen kegs of beer that
were available were also appreci-
ated by all who chose to try them.
5775 was spent on the affair, with

ago failed due to lack of attend-
ance, the members of the E.C.
felt that good returns on their
survey sheets justified looking in-
to possible revisions.

Ideas from the E.C. and from
the public were heard and a list
of proposals from the advisors
at the last public trial was pre-

sented. The list included such '

thoughts as setting up a special
honor council seperate from the
E.C. to deal solely in honor hear-
ings, and banning members of

this council from attending pub- —
lic trials or talking to the jurors ©
on anything other than pro-

cedural matters.

The E.C. plans to devote next
week’s regular meeting, Monday
night at 7:00 p.m., to discussion
and possible vote on the ques-
tion of whether an adversary sys-
tem should be set up for public
trials. Steve Robinson is to write
a recommendation for an inde-
pendent prosecutor and Leland
McCullough and Everett Martin
are to write an argument in
favor of a prosecutor from the
EC.

The other areas under review
by the E.C. include: jury selec-
tion; the possibility of holding
appeals in private instead of the
present public hearing; the pen-
alties for honor violations and
whether the absolute penalty of
expulsion should be applied in
all cases; whether some bound-
aries for application of the Honor
System should be set; and,
whether any change should be
made in the procedure for nota-
tions of honor trials on a stu-
dent's record.

Trustees welcome student input

By the Phi News Staff

In its annual mid-winter meet-
ing the University’s Board of
Trustees voted to grant permis-
sion to the student body and
alumni association presidents to
attend Board committee meet-
ings.

Student and alumni presidents
previously have attended the
Board of Trustees meetings with
full privileges of discussion and
now with an invitation from the
president or rector the same

meetings.

President Huntley said the pur-
pose of the action is to increase
feedback coming from the stu-
dent and alumni interests. This
action applies to the Finance,
Development, Executive, and No-
minating Committees.

Just as in Board meetings, vot-
ing privileges or participation in
executive sessions is not extend-
ed to the student or alumni presi-

Ethics program begins this year

BY STEVE YEVICH

Phi Feature Editor

Ed. note—The following is the
first of two articles dealing with
Washington and Lee’s erperi-
mental ethics program. The
concluding segment will appear
in the nezt issue of the Ring-
tum Phi.

With funding from the Lilly
Foundation, Washington and Lee
has embarked upon an innovative
program of studies in applied
ethies in the fields of law, medi-
cine and journalism.

Under the direction of Dr.

22

 

Louis W. Hodges, professor of
religion, the program has been
designed to expose pre-profes-
sional undergraduates to the
complexities of the ethical
choices that they will be con-
fronted with in their chosen
felds.

According to Dr. Hodges, the
principal goal of the program,
entitled “Society and the Profes-
sions,” is to examine the way in
which the three fields individu-
ally affect society, and to pro-
vide specific. systematic atten-
tion to pressing questions of
human values pertaining to these

Dr. Norman Isaacs

professions, thereby sharpening
the undergraduate’s perception
of his own fields.

The main emphasis is placed
on the class seminars, which are
conducted annually in each of
the three fields. These seminars
are “specifically designed for
seniors who have a reasonable
expectation of entering a career
in journalism, law or medicine,”
says Dr. Hodges. Written reports
prepared by individual students
are the primary focus in each
seminar session; each report is
discussed, its proposals debated,
and its merits analyzed.

The courses are listed in the
300 level of the Interdepart-
mental section of the university
catalogue, as each (with the cur-
rent exception of the medical
ethics course) is team taught by
professors from various depart-
ments. This term Dr. Hodges
and Prorf. MacDonald are teach-
ing Ethies of Journalism, while
Hodees. President Huntley and
Dr. Lowry conduct the course on
law ethies. Dr. Hodges alone will
lead the medical ethics course in
the spring term

The structure of the program
is three-pronged: students en-
roll in the seminars, participate
in & “continuing education” pro-
fram, and attend two public lec-
tures pertaining to the course,
presented by professionals na-
Honally prominent in their re-
spective flelds.

Each year two scholars in each
of the three areas of concern
will be invited to deliver an ad-
dress on applied ethics They
Will also remain on campus for

several days, sitting in on class
sessions and engaging in discus-
sions with the students. Their
formal remarks will be bound
together, published, and distri-
buted to interested alumni and
members of the public. Thus it
appears that something of benefit
to the whole profession will de-
velop from the program.

One of these lectures, Dr.
Norman Isaacs, Associate Dean
of the School of Journalism at
Columbia University, was in Lex-
ington last week in conjunction
with the journalism course; his
address dealt with the future of
ethics in that field. Isaacs seemed
quite concerned about the Ameri-
ean tendency to elevate the dol-
lar bill to “number-one god in
the pantheon of values,” with its
resulting implications on the
field of journalism. He is alarmed
by the spreading trend toward
coporate control and collecti-
Vizaltion of newspapers, stifling
their freedom of thought and ex-
pression. What is needed most
is a journalistic code of ethics,
in Isaacs’ opinion, on which
would guarantee thruthfulness,
responsibility. accuracy, impar-
tiality, and the precedence of
the public right to know over
public curiosity in the guise of
a right.

Concerning the continuing
education symposia, Dr. Hodges
has written in his brochure on
the program: “In each of the
three fields, we expect to bring
ten practicing professionais to
campus for a four or five day
period of study. They are to meet

(Continued on page 4)

 

 

 

 

 

In the same meeting much
time was devoted to finance mat-
ters. Treasurer James White-
head told the Trustees that the
university will not exceed the
budget set for 1974-75.

Farris Hotchkiss, development
director, reported to the Trustees
that of the $36 million 1976 goal,
about 75° has not been commit-
ted to program objectives. He also
said the present alumni dona-
tions are up $44,000 over the
same time last year.

three times a year, in the fall,
winter, and spring, with the win-
ter meeting traditionally held

\ REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

Academic probation

Last Monday the Executive Committee voted by a narrow
margin to recommend that the faculty abolish rules governing
the extracurricular activities open to students placed on aca-
demic probation. As it now stands, a student placed on
academic probation may only participate in one extracurricular
activity. If a student fails to retain a grade-point average of
at least 2.00, he may not run or retain certain campus offices.
These offices include the Executive Committee, University
Council, the chairmen of committees, the editors and business
managers of the publications on campus, the managing editor of
The Ring-tum Phi, class presidents, president of the Uni-
versity Theatre, and the president and vice president of the
Interfraternity Council.

We believe that the Executive Committee should not have
recommended that all these rules be discontinued. Certainly
the University does not want to be overly protective of its
students, but some requirements should be kept. Perhaps a
student on academic probation should not be limited to a
single extracurricular activity by the faculty. Such a limita-
tion probably does very little if anything to force the student
to study more.

On the other hand, a student in academic difficulty prob-
ably cannot fully meet his responsibility to the student body
as a member of the EC or as editor of a student publication.
Some requirements should be placed upon students in posi-
tions of leadership. We feel that at least some means should
be found to insure that members of the student government
and heads of campus organizations are at least able, if not
willing, to meet their responsibilities to their peers.

A gift for the students

Before the time passes us by completely we would like to
acknowledge the exceedingly generous gift of Miss Ruth
Parmly to the school. Her recent contribution of $1.5 million
to the endowment is certainly appreciated by those who fully
realize W&L’s needs.

Too often students feel that a gift to the school is of small
importance to them, They see the President and other Uni-
versity officials working toward and achieving goals for W&L
and feel somewhat left out. Although it may seem at times as
though a gift was made to the President or another adminis-
trator, this is not the case. All gifts are given to serve the
students’ needs directly or indirectly. It is the student body
which profits the most from donations made to the institution.

Again we wish to thank Miss Parmly for her generosity
to Washington and Lee and hope that the student body will
be fully aware of who the actual recipient is.

What happened
to fancy dress?

The formal dress requirement for Fancy Dress has been
dropped. The requirement that students wear at least a suit
to Fancy Dress has also fallen by the wayside. We are afraid
that the students, in their desire not to appear overdressed,
may institute a new requirement of blue jeans and T-shirts
only.

Last week the Student Activities Board was forced to
change the dress requirement for the Fancy Ball.
Apparently certain groups of students threatened to boycott
the festivities if they were forced to wear either a tuxedo or
a suit. To them, wearing anything more formal than a dirty
shirt and work pants appeared as a fate worse than death, If
this is true, we wonder what they plan to be buried in—long
underwear?

| dress

The Student Activities Board has put a great deal of work
into Fancy Dress which should be something special this year.
We regret that students do not seem to be “in the mood” to
go to any trouble for Faney Dress, Certainly the expense of
renting a tuxedo at $11 is not exorbitant. Perhaps this problem
could be avoided in the future if the Admissions Office re-
quired that entering freshmen own their own formal wear,

We hope that the students will reconsider their decision
to insist that they not be required to wear, at the very least,
suits. Learning to deny themselves the indulgence of informa!
if not slovenly appearance might just prove more enjoyable
than they think.

DEAR 'TRAVELLER—I know W&L has had many distinguished men
graduated from among its students, like Roger Mudd from the
undergraduate liberal arts program, and Justice Powell and Doug
Schwartz from the law school. But I can’t for the life of me
think of any alumns who were graduated from the school’s fine
arts program.

(Signed) D. Schwartz

DEAR D.—So?

DEAR TRAVELLER—Name some,, stupid.

DEAR D.—Oh, I get it. Hmmmm. There’s so many alumni from the
fine arts, it’s hard to find a spot to begin. How about a list of
those who stick out in my mind like a magenta crayon in a box
of Crayolas?

—Benjie “Monotone” Skittleton—B.A. in music, 1965. Gained
worldwide notoriety for senior thesis, “Finding a lost chord.”
Has performed many times for the Cleveland Symphonie as a
bass drum. Now attending graduate school in Pomona, Cailif.,
with an F sharp major and an A flat minor. Likes to set faculty
meeting transcripts to music.

—Shirley ‘‘Too Loose”’ LaTruck—B.A. in art (Hollins), 1970.
First exchange student to take up fine arts at W&L. Known for her
work “Sigma Chi bedroom ceiling, as seen while on my back, 1969.”’
Specializes in finger painting, and now serves as adviser to W&L’'s
current fine arts program.

—Irv “Soft-stroke’ Baneskowicz—B.A. in art, 1971. First
W&L exchange student to take up fine arts at Hollins. Known for
his work, “Tinker Dorm bedroom ceiling, as seen while on my
back, 1970.” Likes raspberry ice cream cones.

—Freddy “Look-like-a-tree” Spamatolini—B.A. in drama,
1945. Talented broadway actor, best known for his title role in
“Hair.”

—Ingmar Stetson, Jr—B.A. in Interdepartmental, 1967.
Famed muralist. Best known locally for inspiring creation,
“Bricks,” painted on the side of new Doremus Gym.

—Adlewar Laguna—B.A. in art, 1956. Best known locally for
his sculpture work often seen in front of duPont Hall. Currently
runs junkyard in Staunton.

DEAR TRAVELLER—Will somebody tell those idiots running Fancy
Dress that I still have my scarecrow costume that I bought for
last year’s ball before the theme was changed from “The Wizard
of Oz?”

(Signed) M. Brittin

DEAR M.—Fret not. “Oz” is rumored to be next year’s theme. SAB
Chairman John Killpack said he tried for the theme again next
year, but he couldn't get Southern Sem to agree to provide the
wicked witches. He also said everything was set until he found
out Dorothy was dead.

‘Lion in Winter’ shows
a problem of

By BARNEY SKELTON
Phi Entertainment Editor

The problem one encounters in
the University Theatre produc-
tion of “The Lion in Winter” is
ultimately one of direction. This
is true not only in the sense that
Dave DeChristopher, as director,
errs in certain areas of his re-
sponsibility, but also in the sense
(and this is perhaps a corollary
to the first) that the play lacks
direction in terms of where it
lead us—i.e., what is it about
these characters that ineffably
remains true at the end of the
performance.

Were it not for the buoying ef-
fect of Mr. Minton’'s superb por-
trayal of King Henry, and for the
consistent renditions turned in by
Messrs. Winzeler, Scott, and
Overton as the sons of the King,
this question would remain quite
an enigma.

In reference to the first genre
of the “direction” difficulties, it
is clear that the play, at least in
one obvious instance, was mis-
cast. Although one must pay due
respect to Tama Natkin, a Lex-
ington High School student, for
taking on the role of Alais, it was
patently clear that she was out of
her league. Alais is the “pawn”
among all of the power mongers
of the past, and is, thus, neces-
sarily a rather pathetic figure.
Miss Natkin’s gooey, pleading,
monotone which never broke
stride for the duration of her
stage presence, however, while
merely a testimony to her inex-
perience, was the death of any
pacing which would develop prior
to her entrances.

As is usually the case when one
actor is dragging, the cast eith-
er would descend to the pace she

was setting, or strain themselves
in the attempt to fill up the gap
she was creating. This gap, fur-
thermore, was often extremely
pronounced owing to the fact
that there were so Many scenes
in which she had to play opposite
Henry—at each of those points,
the aforementioned gap enlarged
into a gulf due to the consum-
mately powerful performance
Mr. Minton achieved.

In the final analysis though,
who is to blame for this inconsis-
tency of ability among the mem-
bers of the cast? One fears that
the Fickle Finger of Fate must
point to our director. Although it
is true that directors often gam-
ble giving new or inex
actors a chance on the stage, it
would seem that Mr. DeChristo-
pher was betting against the odds
in choosing Miss Natkin—in do-
ine so, he was much more unfair
to her than to anyone else.

With respect to other aspects
of Mr. DeChristopher’s directing,
one finds three objections. First
of all, in terms of the blocking, it
was quite often the case that ac-
tors were delivering the lines
with their backs to the audience.
Now, of course, in some cases this
was unavoidable, but in several
instances it was unnecessary and
annoying .

Secondly, what on earth was
that music between scenes all
about? It was bad enough that
there had to be so many scene
changes to disrupt the action, but
the music, which is usually a
means to smooth the transition
between scenes, was disruptive,
superfluous, and downright cam-
py. OK, so you're producing a
“satiric’ Lion in Winter,” you
don't have to ram it down our
throats!

direction

Finally, and this is actually Mr.
Romanchuk’s responsibility as
designer, the set was high-school-
ish. Rather than achieve the goal
of a “suggestive” set, the result
was inadequate and distracting
even given the limitations of the
University Theatre facilities.

Before going into the other
“direction” problem, it would be
well to discuss what was good
about the play, for there were
some excellent performances.

As stated before, Henry was
just what he should have been.
Mr. Minton captured both the
vitality of the man who was the
most powerful king in Europe and
the contemplative dejection of a
great man grown old. Indeed, as
he did in the Europe of 1183, he
did in the Troub Theatre in 1975
—Henry carried the day.

As Mr. DeChristopher intimat-
ed in last week's Ring-tum Phi,
“Lion in Winter” is basically a
character study, and the only
other actors who lived up to their
responsibility in the full were the
three sons. Mr. Overton, in his
stage debut, captured the cool
calculating Geoffrey to the tee.
He had just the sneering look
about him that one would expect
Geoffrey to have. Mr. Winzeler,
as the pimply-faced John, was
hilarious. Boyish, pouting, impo-
tent, ineffective and stupid, John
is vital to the humor of the play
and these qualities Mr. Winzeler
seemed to have no problem in

dealing with. Proud and arro-
gant Richard received an able
representation by Mr. Scott. of
the three brothers, Richard is the
most difficult to deal with as a
character, and Mr. Scott was
perfectly suited to the role.

The other “direction” problem
arises when one focuses one’s at-
tention to the portrayal of Elea-
nor by Miss Wilson, and Philip
by Mr. Hogle. In both cases the
actors failed to grasp the essence
of their characters. Miss Wilson,
while conveying well the wistful-
ness and sardonic wit of the cap-
tive queen, somehow missed the
piercing and dynamic intelli-
gence which Eleanor certainly
possessed.

Mr. Hogles leaves it unclear
whether Philip's reasons for
luring Richard into his room,
and subsequent seduction of him,
are amatory or political, The
script suggests the latter — Mr.
Hogle, the former.

Despite the unevenness of cer-
tain individual performances and
the directional problems, the play
is entertaining and, by all means,
worthwhile. The seript is rich in
humor and sarcasm, and as stat-
ed before the excellent perfor-
mance by Mr. Minton truly is a
show in itself.

Swimmers
8-2; state

meet next

While freestylers John Hudson
and Tad Van Leer kept on win-
ning, Washington and Lee’s
swimmers showed some newfound
depth to record a 59-54 dual meet
win over William and Mary in
Williamsburg Saturday.

The Generals, now 8-2 on the
year, won the first five events
of the meet, and staved off a
late charge by the Indians when
Hudson and Bill Tiers finished
1-2 in the 550-yard freestyle.

Hudson had already picked up
wins in the 1000- and 200-yard
freestyles.

Van Leer scored a triple with
a win in the 50, a tie for first
in the 100, and the anchor leg
on W&L’s winning medley relay.

W&L’s other win came from
Rod Scott in the 200-yard indi-
vidual medley.

W&L coach Bill Sterns called
the medley relay win “the key
to the meet.” Stearns said that
if William and Mary had gone
with their top swimmers in the
relay, it would have been much
tougher for W&L to win.

Stearns also said that the Gen-
erals got several second and third
place finishes that helped in the
win. Junior John Henzel picked
up a key second in the 200-yard
backstroke, while senior Dick
Barber was second in both the 50
and the required diving.

The Generals hosted VMI last
evening.

Wrestling Generals lost to VMI,

Washington and Lee wrestlers

for the Generals against VMI.
Crytzer picked up a pin in the

Slumping Generals drop
2 of 3; ODU here tonight

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

Unless Washington and Lee’s
roundballers find the magic
combination that sparked their
surge to win after win early in
the season, the rest of the 1974-
75 campaign could be a real
struggle.

The Generals hit the skids for
the first time last week, dropping
a pair of games on the road to
York (Pa.) College, 78-63, and
Bowie State (Md.) College, 66-
57, while barely escaping with a
69-68 win over Kean (N.J.) Col-
lege earlier in the week.

The two losses dropped W&L’s
season record to 13-5, and, with
nationally-ranked Old Dominion
and Randolph-Macon as well as
defending VCAA champion
Madison left on the schedule, the
Generals’ hope for a 20-win sea-
son and a NCAA tournament bid
might have been left somewhere
along I-81.

The week in review:

a * *

If it hadn't been for some un-
canny foul shooting by Greg
Croghan and John Podgajny,
Tuesday, the Generals’ current
losing streak might be four in-
stead of just two.

W&L hit 23 of 27 from the
charity stripe against Kear, in-
cluding 12 for 12 by Croghan
and four for four by Podgajny,
who hit both ends of a one-and-
one with four seconds left to put
the game out of reach.

The Generals suffered another
cold shooting night, as only
Podgajny, who finished with 20
points, was anywhere near 50
percent from the floor.

As a result of W&L’s poor
shooting, visiting Kean (nee
Newark State) was able to stay
close throughout the game.

Though the Generals led most
of the way, they could never open
up more than a nine-point lead
despite several Kean turnovers in

the second half which presented
W&L a chance to break the game
wide open.

The Generals fritted away a
seven-point lead late in the game,
but the clutch foul shooting of
Croghan and Podgajny saved the
win.

Croghan, who had been on a
scoring tear, ended with a sea-
son high 22 points, while adding
9 rebounds.

* * *

The Genearls’ slump continued
as they traveled north for a pair
of games with York and Bowie
State.

A year ago both teams were
victims of W&L as the Generals
rallied late in the season to give
head coach Verne Canfliield his
eighth straight winning season.

This time W&L went into the
weekend assured of an above
500 campaign, as the win over
Kean gave W&L the thirteenth
win needed for a winning season.

This time around, it was W&L
who filled the victim’s shoes.

The Generals played their
sloppiest basketball of the sea-
son, showing no offense and not
much more defense while their
opponents came up with their
best games of the season.

W&L led York by as many as
eight points early in, the game,
only to watch in seeming dis-
belief as the host Spartans came
back to grab a 36-32 halftime
lead.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Phi Beta Kappa selects members

sy BILL THOMPSON

Phi Beta Kappa _ recently
selected 18 seniors and 7 juniors
for admission in the Washing-
ton and Lee chapter to honor
them for scholastic achievement
and for their contributions to
the college community.

With this group two faculty
members, Dr. Shillington and
Dr. Spencer, were spotlighted
with honorary memberships in
the organization; these honor-
ary appointments were extra-
ordinary and the two that re-
ceived them were carefully con-
sidered by the chapter member-
ship.

Phi Beta Kappa annually hon-
ors individuals of high academic
standing and integrity; however
this year fewer students were
selected for the organization
partly due to a newly-established
higher grade “cut-off” point.

Despite the fact that there is
no set GPA for admission, there
is an undisclosed cut-off point
for consideration to the group
which varies from year to year.

Dr. DeVogt, president of the
local chapter, revealed that the
now-prevailing grade inflation—
largely a result of the university’s
relaxed poliy of a 1-12-6 credit
load system—put more students
into the consideration category
than before and that an “‘infla-
tion-proof measure” was deemed
necessary by the group to keep
membership at the desired level.
This measure was a higher “cut-
off’ point for seniors grades so
that only the usual 10 percent
of the senior class could be ad-
mited this year. (Juniors must
have at least a 3.5 average to be
considered for admission.) No
more than 15 percent of the class
can ever be admitted, according

regularly with the undergradu-
ates and thus provide the class
that experience in decision-mak-
ing that the undergraduate lacks.
We believe the undergraduate
can provide for the professionals
an important measure of fresh-
ness and inquisitiveness that is
so necessary for ethically con-
scious decision-making.”

Prof. MacDonald says that
these sessions will give the pro-
fessionals a chance “‘to sit down
and cogitate about ethics and
their fields—-they will be given
a few days to just think...
We are bringing them here not
as resource people; we are ex-
pecting to give ideas to them,
not them to us.”

Besides looking into the pros-
pects and complications of
formulating a journalistic code
of ethics, the question of the
social responsibility of the press
and broadcast media will be
debated by the eleven students

in the second half for W&L, as
York continued to capitalize on
the Generals’ errors and pull
away to a big lead.

Tony Fannick, one of four
junior college transfers which
have given a big boost to York's
basketball hopes (ast season
they went 1-22). led the Spartans
with 21 points.

Croghan again led W&L with
18 points.

The Generals outrebounded
their shorter opponents, 54-33,
but shot only 35 percent from the
floor, which is where too many
games are decided for W&L.

Bowie State put the Generals
to sleep with a four-corner type
slowdown offense, and, by the
time W&L woke up, they were too
far behind to catch up.

The Bulldogs crawled to a 23-
12 halftime lead as their delib-
erate play on offense seemingly
caused W&L to forget how to put
the ball in the basket.

for example, should items be

Who should control the dis-
semination of those items that

which in essense perform a vital
public service, be under the con-
trol of private individuals or
corporations? How can the free-
doms guaranteed by the First
Amendment be preserved, while
providing a balance to excessive
press criticism?

Prof. MacDonald feels that the
course in applied ethics in journ-
alism is a quite valid addition to
the curriculum. “There has been
tremendous development of
journalism ethics in the last
several years, with Watergate
making a big influence,” says
MacDonald, “and the press, be-

tion as it is, needs a good out-

The Bulldogs upped their lead

Generals with good foul shooting

to the by-laws.

The decision to raise the cut-
off point was reached by the
faculty and membership of the
chapter with a secret ballot vote.
The system, according to Dr.
DeVogt, is an imperfect one but
so far the Executive Committee
has come up with no better sug-
gestions. The by-laws of the
group are very flexible in most
areas and the membership has
the deciding vote in regulating
the organization in many cases.
A combination of variable in-
fluences the organization’s poli-
cies and, as a consequence, the
selection of new members. Ap-
parently regulatory legislation
was necessary, as Dr. DeVogt can
illustrate. He has been here for
13 years; in his first years at
W&L only 5-6 percent of the
senior class was admitted an-
nually. Recently, specifically in
the past two years, over 10 per-
cent of the class has been ad-
mitted.

The following students have
been elected to membership in
the Gamma of Virginia Chapter

Procter & Gamble
Brand Management

It’s One of the Finest Career
Opportunities Available Anywhere

bd Gow Litt Med te MEAL

Procter & Gamble manufactures more than 50 consumer products,
including Crest toothpaste, Duncan Hines cake mixes, Tide detergent,
Pampers disposable diapers, Scope mouthwash and many others
whose names you would recognize just as easily.
For each product, there is a small group, usually just 3 people, who
plan, create, and supervise the total consumer marketing effort —
including TV advertising — for that brand. It’s called Brand Manage-
ment, and it is one of the most challenging and personally rewarding
jobs in our company.

Right now we're looking for a few highly qualified college seniors to
join us at the beginning level in brand management. “Innovative”,
“proven record of leadership and being able to get things done”,
“superior academic achievement”, and “good oral and written com-
munications skills” are some of the words we use to describe the
people we want.

We want a “take charge” person who can assume immediate respon-
sibility, learn quickly, contribute good ideas, and cope with (and even
enjoy) constantly changing situations. To such a person we offer a
very bright future. We promote only from within, and only on merit,
and you'll move ahead in marketing management as fast as you show
by your work that you're ready for more responsibility.

If this interests you, and you think you qualify, read the folder on P&G
Brand Management that's in your Placement Office. Then, if you're
still interested, fill out the Personal Data Sheet that's also in your
Placement Office and send it to:

Faculty to Consider
Accelerated ‘Terms
At Next Meeting

Shortened Semesters,
Summer School Among
Emergency Alternations

Keeping in step with a nation-
wide wartime program to acceler-
ate college sessions in order to
give students an opportunity to
finish four years work in three
years, the faculty will meet Mon-
day afternoon, February 24, 1942,
to take under consideration a
speed-up program for Washing-
ton and Lee.

Three committees of the facul-
ty are working on the new pro-
gram at present and, according
to President Gaines, all indica-
tions are that the program will
be adopted beginning with a
shortened second semester and a
summer school session. This may
involve curtailment of all holi-
days and a short exam shcedule
this semester, Dr. Gaines said.
Final plans will be decided at the
faculty meeting on Monday.

li the proposed plan is adopted,
there will be a voluntary summer
program for all students, which
will be merely “an extension of
the reguiar session.” Present
plans are to divide the summer
session into two halfs in order to
“accomodate the varying needs
of the students.” The first half
will be six weeks long with classes
meeting five days a week, and
the second half will last for five
weeks with classes scheduled six
days a week. Classes will be an

hour and a half in length, Stu-
dents will be allowed to take two
courses (that is, three hours a
day). In this way, a maximum
of 12 semester hours of work
would be obtainable during the
11-weeks period.

All courses which are required
as prerequisites for higher cours-
es would be offered in the
summer school, as well as courses
required for the various majors.
Other courses would be offered
as the demand calls for them.
The possibility of opening the
summer school program to
women is “now being discussed”
by the faculty committees. As
ihe summer program is now pro-
posed, members of the present
junior ciass who attend the ses-
sion and received the full 12
hours credit, would be able to
graduate the following February,

es they took six courses

dwring tne first semester of next
year.

Tne dates ior the proposed
summer session have not yet been
decided. By eliminating Spring
Vacation and shortening the sec-
ond semester exam period, this
college year would probably end
about May 25.

Timely Advice

 

The ‘above, one of 1 many posters to be found on campus, carries a
message which each of us should bear in mind. Loose lips sink
ships and cause needless deaths on the battlefield.

University Dance Code

1. All Washington and Lee dances shall be free from intoxicants
and the effects thereof.

2. Any person attending a dance in violation of Regulation 1
shall be removed from the gymnasium immediately and suspended
from attending further dances until his case has been tried by the
Executive Committee of the Student Body.

3. The penalty for a first infraction of Regulation 1 shall be ex-
clusion from one half of the dances of a session, commencing with
the date of the offense: provided, that for drunkenness or other
disorderly conduct, or for a second offense, or for the possession of
intoxicants anywhere within the gymnasium during a dance, the
penalty shall be exclusion for not less than one calendar year. For
visitors and alumni, the penalties shall be not less than those pro-
vided for students under similar circumstances.

4. No visitor shall be admitted to any dances unless vouched for
in writing by a student or by some person officially connected with
the University. If a visitor shall be found gulity of violating Regula-
tion 1, above, a student vouching for him shall be excluded from
one or more sets of dances,

5. Smoking is prohibited at all times on the dance floor and in
the balcony.

6. General conduct shall conform to the commonly accepted
standards of good society.

7. The Dance Floor committee is vested with full authority and
accepts responsibility for the enforcement of these regulations.

A Few Suggestions

Please Watch Your Step

Next Friday night, February
28, 1942, the Lexington area will
have its first practice blackout.
And a blackout is something
which demands 100 per cent co-
operation and efficiency. A
lighted match, a careless driver,
an uncovered window can spell
disaster.

It's only a practice, but the
fact that it is not the real thing
doesn't mean that it shouldn't be
taken dead seriously.

Most students still remember
how amusing it seemed when a

EC Will Poll
Student Body on

Corsage Issue

Many Want Flowers Banned;
Questionnaires to be Circulated

Does the student body want
the passage of a rule banning
flowers for dates at University
dances?

That's the question to which
the Executive Committee will try
to answer by means of a poll
next week, Student Body Presi-
dent Al Snyder announced today.

The committee Tuesday night
decided to conduct a poll in an
effort to find whether or not
sentiment in favor of anti-flower
legislation is widespread enough
to warrant action by the Ex-
ecutive group. Attacks on the
giving of corsages have been
launched several times in the
past few years, but none have
proved weighty enough to result
in the abolition of floral gifts.

“Numerous members of the
student body have asked the
Executive Committee to consider
legislation banning flowers,”
Snyder said in announcing plans
for the poll. “We are not trying
to push anything through, but
feel that the problem should be
considered inasmuch as so many
students have asked for such a
consideration.”

“The committee feels that the
opinions of every member of the
student body should be heard be-
fore any definite action is taken,

and a poll appears to be the best
method of obtaining a complete
collection of those opinions,”
Snyder continued.

“We are announcing plans for
the poll now so that each mem-
ber of the student body will have
plenty of time to weigh the vari-
ous arguments. The commitee’s
desire is not to rush into any
action, but rather to find out
what the student body wants.
Whether or not we have legisla-
tion against flowers is a question
which the student body will be
called upon to answer.”

If sentiment as expressed in
the poll emphatically favors pro-
hibitive legislation, the Executive
Committee will draw up an act
barring flowers from all Uni-
versity dances. Such a measure,
Snyder said, would probably be-
come a part of the Dance Board
regulations and enforcement
would fall to the floor committee.

A three-man committee was
appointed by Snyder to draw up
questions for use in the poll.
Their questions will be submitted
to the Executive group next
Tuesday night for approval, and
printed questionnaires will be
circulated among fraternity
houses and eating places next
Thursday.

Zigging Jitterbuggers Land in Hospital

A couple of jitterbugs landed
in the hospital when they tried
to keep up with the “Washing-
ton and Lee Swing’ in Mobile,
Alabama.

Here's the story as reported
in a September ‘41 issue of a
Mobile newspaper:

“Who was it who said ‘Zig
when you should zig, and zag
when you should zag’? Anyway,
Evelyn Dill zigged when she

should have zagged, and she paid
for it.

“It was the jitterbug dance
craze combined with a juke point
version of the W&L Swing in
boogy-woogy time, enough to
cause any accident,

“Now when the girl zig pecks,
the boy zags pecks, and vice
versa. When the girl jig pecks
and the boy zig pecks at the same
time, there's liable to be trouble.
This time there was.”

Reacts to Pearl Harbor

Troub Drama Satirizes Nazis

Thursday. night, February 27,
1942, at eight o'clock, Washing-
ton and Lee's dramatic group,
The Troubadours, will present
one of the most popular plays of
last season in Clare Booth’s
“Margin For Error.’

“The Third Reich allows no
margin for error,” is the line
from whence the title came, and
this philosophy of administration
backfires during the course of the
play to the chagrin of the staff

at a Nazi Consulate in New
York. and to the delight of the
audience,

The Consul, Karl Baumer, is
played by Ed Boyd in his usual
manner, which is to say a flaw-
less performance may be ex-
pected

His wife. Sophie, a frustrated
American eirl] who married Bau-
mer years before as a means of

escaping from Germany, is play-
ed by Esteen Cooke.

Sophie is in leve with a young
American newspaper man, Tom
Denny, played by Jim Clarke.
Clarke has a difficult part, but
handles it extremely well. When
the play was produced profes-
sionally,, crities referred to him
as somehow “two-dimensional,”
eoloriess, merely a voice express-
ing American contempt for the
Nazi person as well as the Nazi
philosophy.

The mayor of New York as-
signed a Jewish policeman, Moe
Finklestein, as Baumer's body-
euard. This leads to many amus-
ing situations, with Finklestein
expressing freely and eloquently
his sentiments and the senti-
ments of his race toward the
Nazi bully boys. Bill Lats, as
Moe Finkiestein, turns in a con-
vincing performance of the long-

est part in the entire play. His
part reaches its zenith when he,
a New York Jewish boy, is called
pon to unravel the murder of
Baumer, the Nazi consul.

Next to Boyd, perhaps, the most
polished performer seems to be

wk Lanich, a newcomer. Most
of the drama is added by his
characterization, and he does it
well, managing to remain on the
thin line between melodrama
and under-acting, Charles Thal-
helmer, as the inevitable doctor,
and Helen Anderson. as the Ger-
man maid add the final touches
of realism to a play which lacks
little.

At one point in the preduction
an actual speech of Adolph
Hitler is broadcast. Farrar wrote
to New York for recordings of
this speech, and they should
prove interesting.

industrial belt, were gleaming
brightly, he could get his bear-
ings and proceed to blast to bits
some munitions factory or naval
base or thickly populated area.

That is why Lexington has
scheduled a practice on Friday
night. And here are a few sug-
gestions to Washington and Lee
students to help make it effective.

Each fraternity should have
some representative see the local
officials in charge of the air raid
precautions and determine just
what measures should be taken
to blackout the fraternity houses.
It is impractical to set about
covering all the windows. but the
basement lounges of most the
houses could be made into ex-
cellent shelters with a little work.
Then it would be unnecessary
for all to sit around in the dark
for two or more hours.

All students with cars should
most certainly get off the streets
before the warning sounds about
eight o'clock, for even in a “play”
blackout one can pile into a
ditch or telephone pole with a
little or no difficulty.

With all restaurants and school
buildings closed there should be
no excuse for anyone to be on
the streets, which are to be
patrolled by VMI cadets and
civilian wardens,

During the next week every-

one should familiarize himself
with all the regulations to be in
effect during the blackout and
prepare to do his part to make
this effort as successful as pos-
sible

comment contained in the last issue of this paper merit thoughtful
consideration from every student. Here I offer an observation and an
assurance.

When this emergency developed, I telegraphed President Roose-
velt pledging full support of the University. I am confident that
every member of the academic community shares that sentiment, a
desire to affirm our deepened allegiance and a desire to be of maxi-
mum service.

With its wiser comprehension of ways by which that service may
be rendered, our Government has not indicated any change in the
attitude toward the college man. As before, those who are impelled
by profound desire to enter a combat unit may do so, and those who
want to complete their training may feel that they are discharging
a patriotic duty in giving themselves the best fitness, whether for the
later stages of the emergency or for the larger requisites of citizen-
ship after the days of warfare.

At all events, students should not be disturbed by the volume of
rumors, already denounced by President Roosevelt, which are flood-
ine our excited country and undermining the morale of our people.
For example, as chairman of the Committee on Public Affairs of the
Association of American Colleges, I have been giving much time to
the Government's expectations from the colleges, and I repeat that-—
rumor to the contrary—there has been no change in the attitude or
program relating to colleges.

Students will, I am sure, reason with themselves that the immedi-
ate duty is to bring all energies of mind to discharging their present
task. It is an opportunity of patriotism. not less than of personal de-
velopment, to have the privilege of college education.

No worthy causes and no worthy people—not your country, not
your family, not yourseif—could possibly be served by undue worry,
by needless meloncholy, least of all by just quitting and giving your-
self to idleness and purposeless dismay. No cause could be served by
such conduct except the enemies of this country who would surely
like to spread panic in the mind of the college youth.

The University promises to keep the students advised of any
change that affects their status of national obligation. The Uni-
versity promises to help its boys, personally and collectively, as far as
outsiders can help in the domain of individual decision, as these
boys seek to interpret that duty. The University promises, as Dr.
Tucker said, to adopt fair procedures in the case of every student who
is subject to the emergency demand that interrupts his own pro-
gram of life

We have always been proud of the maturity of self-control and the
clearheaded judgement that mark Washington and Lee men. In these
troubled days our boys will sustain these qualities in their own lives.
to the infinite advantage of both the country an dthemselves.

FRANCIS P. GAINES.

Fancy Dress, Feb.

A War-Time Affair

In official cireles it's known as “Fancy Dress 1942.” What
a phrase that has turned out to be!

The Junior Prom has come and gone, ‘Tomorrow night
brings on the Ball itseli—Monte Carlo in 1861, with all the
dazzling splendour of the luxurious court of Napoleon, III,
and the Empress Eugenie. Then a dansant and the next night,
the ODK Formal to put the finishing touches on the outstand-
ing social affair of Washington and Lee,

It’s the 36th annual Fancy Dress set, but few students are
interested in the past history of the Ball. What’s much more
important is the fact that here and now, at our feet, is “Fancy
Dress 1942,”

1942 is no common, ordinary year. It has been and will be
packed with excitement unlike anything we have ever experi-
enced before. New events, new names, and new places are
every day being brought to our minds with a force that is
sometimes almost strong enough to knock us over.

So it naturally follows that this is no common, ordinary
Fancy Dress. No matter how many dance sets we have at-
tended before, this Fancy Dress will be a new experience for
all of us. It is a war-time Ball on a war-time basis, and it
will inevitably bring with it all the excitement and interest of
the days in which we are living.

Corsages were absent from the Junior Prom. Decorations
have been kept at a minimum. But there were the band, and
the music, and the evening dresses, and the girls—and on top
of all that, the excitement and glamour of 1942.

Tomorrow's dance will provide a perfect example of the
atmosphere of the whole set. The costumes and colors of a
Monte Carlo in 1861, the quiet t and ordered tempo of those
dear, dead days, will be somewhat symbolic of the 35 Fancy
Dresses that are past. But to offset that calm and collected
atmosphere, there'll be a band heaving the rhythm of the time),
Harps and violins might be appropriate to Monte Carlo in
1861, but Woody Herman's drums and trumpets are far more
fitting for 1942.

So it becomes more and more obvious that this is a Fancy
Dress to be long remembered, The student leaders and their
aids deserve a lot of credit for bringing about a dance set such
as this under trying circumstances. It was not a small task,
and by no means an easy one,

exams, fortunately, are a thing of the past. Beginning next
week there lies ahead of most of us a new semester of class-
rooms and tests. We must accept the inevitable, but for the
moment—tonight and tomorrow—we can still enjoy what will
surely be the grandest Fancy Dress of our lives.

Editor, Ring-tum Phi

Dear Sir:

Friends and alumni of Wash-
ington and Lee have always been
proud of the seemly behaviour
and gentlemanly appearance of
members of the student body.
For generations, Washington and
Lee students have been careful
to maintain their well-earned
reputation in this respect, by a
scrupulous observance of the
niceties of conduct and appear-
ance, and by a careful consid-
erateness, not only of the rights,
but of the comfort and feelings,
of their fellow students, and
especially of the general public
with whom they come into con-
tact both on and off the campus.

When one hears over and over
again that the gentlemanly be-
haviour of Washington and Lee
students suffers distinctly by
comparison with that of mem-
bers of the student bodies of
nearby institutions, it is alarm-
ing. When one sees members of
the student body of one of those
strangers to them, while our own
boys pay so little attention as
scarcely to allow them room to
pass On & compus walk, it is
appalling! When one walks into
& meeting at Lee Chapel, and is
confronted by a row of from
twenty-five to fifty students sit-
ting in the balcony seats with
dirty shoes marring the paint on
the rail, with knees as high as
shoulders, and trousers pulled up
to expose wrinkled socks and not
too shapely but very hairy calves,
it is disgusting! And when, at the
same meeting, one sees a student

sitting in one of the front seats
downstairs, calmly smoking a
pipe, in a building not fireproof-
ed, utterly disregarding a group
of ladies sitting nearby—well,
something is wrong!

A stroller through the comfort-
able and beautifully furnished
reading room of the new McCom-
ick Library, which is open to the
public and necessarily frequent-
ed by the ladies on the staff of
the library, finds students in
various stages of undress, with
feet marring the surfaces of good
furniture and soiling the white
paint of raditors, hats on, and
cigarette stumps ground out on
the floor, even though ashtrays
are provided in abundance.

No one will believe that Wash-
ington and Lee students really
have as little respect for pro-
perty, whether public or private,
as they seem to exhibit.

If other evidences of what
must be only an apparent de-
cadence of good manners at
Washington and Lee were need-
ed, the writer could furnish them.
Such specification is, it is hoped,
quite unnecessary, and is surely
undersirable. If this letter does
anything to bring about a more
careful self-criticism in these
matters on the part of the indi-
vidual student, it will have ac-
complished all that could be
hoped for by one who writes in
& spirit of sympathy and well-
wishing, and of honest criticism.

Sincerely,
An Alumnus.

Because of the greatest musical
war in history, the “Washington

ships” and “At the Fancy Dress
Ball” will not be broadcast by
Benny’ Goodman or Charlie
Barnet during Fancy Dress 1941,
unless peace is restored between
ASCAP (‘American Society of
Composers, Authors and Pub-
lishers) and the powerful radio
chains.

ASCAP collects money for the
use of its music from theatres,
night clubs, restaurants and
radio stations, and distributes
it to its members who, without

Fancy

some such organization, would
find it almost impossible to col-
lect their royalties. Last year
two-thirds of ASCAP’s income
was derived from radio. This
year the society wanted to raise
radio’s license payments to $6,-
500,000 and place most of the
burden on the big broadcasting
chains.

In rebuttal, the broadcasting
industry, backed by the power-
ful chains, set up a rival ASCAP
in Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI)

to supply music for radio’s needs
independent of ASCAP.

‘A Night at Monte Carlo’

In a sparkling atmosphere of
international revelry and splen-
dor amid the columned, crystal
beauty of Monte Carlo’s famed
Casino, the past lives again at
the 1942 Fancy Dress Ball. The
theme of the Ball is a reenact-
ment of the grand opening of
the famous Casino at Monte
Carlo in 1861.

Reaching back eighty years for
a period known for its grandeur
and going to the Riviera, play-
ground of the
sportiest of the
world’s sports,

for the setting, Fancy
the January 30 Dress
pageant trans-

forms students 1942

and their ladies
into holders of
top rank among
the world’s social sets and turns
Doremus Gymnasium into a

splendor-decked ballroom fit for
the presence of not one but sev-
eral kings.

The reenactment of the 1861
opening of the Casino where fab-
ulous fortunes were won and lost
will be centered about a reception
tendered visiting royalty by Na-
poleon, III, of France and the
Empress Eugenie. The gala open-
ing ball will follow the reception.

The Fancy Dress Figure, fea-
turing the set’s nine officers and
50-odd students and their dates,
will portray the reception, while
costumed hundreds will con-
tribute to the merriment of the
Ball.

Included among the leading
figures at the festivities will be
the Prince of Wales and Lily
Langtree, famed English actress;
Alexander, II, of Russia, and
Tzarina Augusta Victoria; Max-
imillian and Carlotta, of Mexico;

Don Francisco Assissi, King of
Spain, and his queen; Franz
Joseph, Emperor of the Austro-
Hungarian Empire, and Empress
Elizabeth; Victor Emmanuel, I,
of Italy, and Queen Maria Adel-
aide; the Bey of Algiers and his
lady; and the Prince and Prin-
cess of Monaco, site of the Casino.

The Figure will include an
elaborate presentation in which
visiting royalty, dipomats, gen-
erals, and, generally, la creme
do la creme of international so-
ciety will be allowed to offer
their salutations to the Emperor
Napoleon, Ill, and his Empress
Eugenie. The guests will be pre-
sented in strict accordance to
rules of international and royal
etiquette.

First will come the Tzar of
Russia, Alexander, IJ, and Au-
gusta Victoria. Following the
imperial couple will be the Arch-

Kay Kyser and Bob Chester!

They're the bands for Pancy

To the strains of “My Old
Kentucky Home,” Fancy Dress
leaders will pantomine a recep-
tion at Federal Hill, mansion of
Colonel John Rowan, given in
honor of Colonel H. P. McGrath,
owner of the horse that has just
won the Kentucky Derby.

After the leaders have walked

in, the proceedings will start with
a toast to Governor Leslie of
Kentucky proposed by Colonel
Rowan. All the prominent Ken-
tucky gentlemen will be repre-
sented by members of the senior
class,

Doors will close at ten o'clock
sharp tonight for the Fancy
Dress Figure, the set president
said today. Anyone arriving
after that time will have to
wait until the Figure is over
before being allowed in

Following the Governor's re-

sponse to the toast, the partici-
pants will drink the health of
Aristides, the winner of the
Derby, and McGrath, and then
present a loving cup ‘to Colonel
McGrath.

Next, Ginny Simms will sing
a Stephen Foster melody, and a
wreath of flowers will be pre-
sented to the jockey, Oliver Lewis,
who spurred the winner home.
Then the couples in a figure will
waltz away to the tune of “Jean-
nie With the Light Brown Hair.”

The setting will be complete
with Churchill downs in the
distance, Pickaninnies, whittling
on the rail fence that surrounds
the gardens, guests drinking mint
juleps ‘(ginger ale) served by
Pompey, the Federal Hill butler.
And, of course, there will be a
stable boy.

After the opening formalities
have been observed, Kay Kyser
will offer the sweet sounds of
some of his most popular melo-
dies, eg. Blue Rain, The Little
Fox, Monstro the Whale, Honest
John, I'm Fit To Be Tied, Happy
Rirthday to Love, and I've Made
the Greatest Discovery.

Kyser, who recently returned
from Hollywood after completing
his picture, “That's Right—
You're Wrong,” is now taking it
easy with one top-flight radio
show a week—his “College of
Musical Knowledge” over NBC-——
and an occasional theatre ap-
pearance.

Kyser last played a stand here
for final ‘36 when he was just
gaining top-rank reputation, and
numerous set leaders have un-
successfully attempted to sign
him for a repeat engagement.

Ginny Simms, blue-eyed vocal-

Happy After Biggest Swindle
In Annals of Fancy Dress Set

Love conquers all. Even libel
suits, suits for invasion of priv-
acy, alienation of affections, im-
personation, fradulent use of the
mails, the Mann Act—anything
you can think of. Little Cupid
saved two W&L adventurers a
maximum of $10,000 in laweyrs’
fees, fines, and bribery fees to get
out of jail sentences.

Seven hundred miles is a long
way for anyone to come to Fancy
Dress—even if you’ve known the
fellow all your life and think he’s
the finest boy in the world. But
to come 700 miles and find you’ve
got a date with a boy you never
saw or heard of before, a boy
who been writing you for three
months under the name of an
old sweetheart of yours, a boy
who has been slinging a line via
the U. S. mails as thick as some
of these heavy woolen Fancy
Dress costumes, a boy who has
libeled the good name of every-
one you ever mentioned in your
correspondence — that’s bad.
Migthy bad. Bad enough to col-
lect a sizeable sum in any court
in the land. But there’s a girl
out at the Lambda Chi house
who underwent every one of these
atrocities—and stil more—and is
having the time of her life—not
angry at all. It must be love. We
can't see it any other way.

The offender is Scott Smither,
alias Scott Smitherman. The
lovely young thing is Caroline
Mays, of Mississippi State Col-
lege for Women.

Three months ago Caroline was
thinking over the list of her old
beaus and happened to remember
Scott, whom she hadn't seen in
three years. Hearing that he was
at W&L, she wrote him. Since no
Scott Smitherman ever saw the
inside of Washington Hall, Scott
Smither got the letter. Puzzled as
to what to do with it, and never

“2

 

having heard of anyone at
MSCW, he approached his room-
mate as to what to do with it.
Then the trouble started.

Roommates getting each other
in trouble as they always do,
Scott’s jumped on the letter like
it was a $1,000 bill and beat out
a letter in return, libeling all the
old friends she asked about and
warming things up with a nice,
thick lot of bull.

Caroline, thinking she had at
last found her long lost Smither-
man, replied; correspondence
flew rapidly, and she finally sent
the privacy invaders a picture.
It was beautiful—so what do the
offenders of every code of justice
and morals do but ask her up
to Fancy Dress. She accepted at
once.

Then the worry sessions start-
ed. Exams went by unnoticed as
they beat their heads against
stone walls hour after hour. How
were they to break the news.
And what were they to do when
she found out and flew at them
like a mad hen. Thick was the
gloom at the LXA house.

She hit town early this morn-
ing. Stumblingly they managed
to get out the truth. She was
shocked—that’'s the best word we
can find for it. But after hours
of haranguing around they
finally persuaded her to go out
to the house. There the house-
mother added the good cause of
placating her.

Finally she came out of stun-
ned trance, realized it was a great
dance after all and now is just
about the happiest, gayest date
on the campus. Look for her
at the dance tonight—Caroline
Mays. The only way we can

figure it out is it must be love.

But just where is the bona-
fide Smitherman now. He may
sue yet.

World War I! affected Fancy Dress but did not cause its discontinuation. The 1943 Fancy Dress Ball
had as its theme “The American Spirit,” and the set was two nights instead of the usual three. The
pageant had not lost its glamour, however, as students dressed themeselves as military heroes from
1776 to 1918 and danced to the sounds of one of the better bands around, Jack Teagarden and hia

Sounds of Forties’ Swing Era

Derived From Depression Jazz

By THE BIG APPLE

A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-
I gotta gal in Kalamazoo
A real tipperoo...

Believe it or not these lyrics are
to one of the hottest songs heard
in the “soda-shop” and on such
radio programs as ‘‘Let’s Dance,”
in 1941. These are the opening
lines to ‘‘Kalamazoo”’ written and
recorded by Glenn Miller and
his orchestra. Miller’s music is
representative of the decade of
1935 to 1945, a period known as
the “Swing Era.”

And although swing music was
sold as a “new” kind of music—
with all the high-pressure tactics
of modern publicity it was actu-
ally a simple modification of
black jazz into a more fashion-
able and fuller sound of the big
bands. It was brought to the
attention of the public in the
press and at movies, on the juke-
box and on the radio.

The phrase and the sounds of

swing music are back today.
Again with the aid of the same
media, the same promoters are
trying to sell the ‘new’ music.
But actually what Stan Rubin
played in the forties, and what
he will regurgitate tomorrow
night at Fancy Dress is the
logical consolidation of what had
been done prior to swing music.

Among collegians, jazz has al-
ways found a home. During the
early years of the Depression the
five man bands of Louis Arm-
strong and Duke Ellington were
most popular. They were small
and because the entertainers
were black, they were cheap.

Similarly, the college crowd of
the late sixties enjoyed black
music again. This time a little
bit more professional — The
Supremes and The Fourtops re-
vived the New Orleans four beat
smooth-flowing style. With cost
factors of electrical equipment
so high, both sould and all pop
music was limited in size.

But the vociferous markets of
the forties and the seventies were
not satisfied. The jitterbuggers,
bobby-soxers and gatorers of

Oh whata gal!
In Kalamazoo...

The tricks of making a big
band swing is amazingly simple.

The thirteen musicans of the
band are divided into teams or
sections: brass (5), reeds (4) and
rhythm (4). The rhythm section
backs up all the others with a
steady pulse. The _ repeated
phrases, which the brass and
reed sections throw back and
forth give it the swing motion.
This timing is known as ‘riffing.’

Riffs developed into a fine art,
chorus after chorus. The words
to swing music (as silly as the
lyric to any popular music) are
written in poetic iambic meter to
give the head the same beat that
the feet are getting.

In a sense, the swing music
revival demonstrates that a good

WésL finds wins scarce in February

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports [Editor

While the month of December
held little else than victories for
Washington and Lee’s winter
athletic teams, February has seen
W&L wins a lot harder to come
by.

Only the Generals’ swimming
team continued its winning ways
over the past two weeks, nipping
Virginia Military in a dual meet
on February 5 and placing a
strong fifth in the Virginia State
Swimming Championships this
past weekend,

Meanwhile W&L’'s slumping
basketball team took a ride on
a win-loss roller coaster, sand-
wiching a pair of wins over
Eastern Mennonite and Emory
and Henry between losses to na-
tionally-ranked Old Dominion,
Lynchburg, and Hampden-Syd-
ney.

And W&L's wrestlers weren't
much luckier, placing second in
the VCAA Championships on
February 8 before dropping three
of four meets on a _ southern
swing over the Washington Holi-
day.

A day-by-day summary of the
past two weeks:

FEBRUARY 5—W&L_ swim-
mers took the meet’s final event,
the 400-yard freestyle relay, to
record a 60-53 win over neigh-
boring Virginia Military Institute.

Wé&L captain Will Brotherton
came from behind on the anchor
leg of the relay to win it for
the Generals, who were hard-
pressed to beat a psyched-up
VMI team.

Brotherton earlier
the 200-yard butterfly.

Freshman John Hudson won
three events, the 200-, 500-, and
1650-yard freestyles, while sopho-
more Tad Van Leer won the 50-
and 100-yard freestyles.

FEBRUARY 6—Old Dominion,
the eighth ranked team in the
Associated Press College Divi-
sion rankings, handed W&L its
first home loss of the 1974-75
season, 92-64.

only one of six games on the
road prior to their trip to Lex-
ington, put the game away with
a 15-2 spurt early in the first
half to go ahead 23-11.

The Generals never got with-
iu 11 points of their vistors after
the scoring binge, but stayed
within 16 throughout most of
the second half. Not until the
final moments did ODU run their
lead toward the final margin of
28 points.

Jeff Fuhrmann led five Mon-
archs in double figures with 20
points. Senior guard Oliver Pur-
nell added 16 points and eight
assists, while 6'9" sophomore
Wilson Washington, the much
heralded transfer from Maryland,
collected 15 points, 15 rebounds,
and four blocked shots.

Norm Kristoff played his best
game of the year for W&L, finish-
ing with 17 points, 11 rebounds,
and three blocks.

Greg Croghan added 13 points,
while Bowman Williams and
John Podgajny scored 11 and 10
points each.

FEBRUARY 8—Three W&L
wrestlers grabbed individual
championships as the Generals
placed second at the VCAA
Wrestling Championships at
Fairfax, Va.

W&L had a chance for the
team title, but heavyweight
Steve Schweizerhof dropped his
linal match to Virginia State's
Curtis Pleasents, 7-1, to give
Madison the team crown, 77!
to 74.

W&L's individual winners were
Howdy Knipp (118), Jim Crytzer
(158), and Doug Ford (177).

Meanwhile the basketball Gen-
erals broke their three-game los-
ing streak with an 84-74 win
over Eastern Mennonite in
a VCAA conference game.

The win upped the Western
Division leading Generals’ con-
ference record to 4-0. It also
brought an end to the Royals’
seven-game win streak.

W&L never trailed in the game,
jumping out to a 10-point lead
early in the first half before
settling for a nine-point lead at
intermission, 46-37.

The Generals led by as many
as 15 points in the second half
before EMC rallied to cut the
lead to 77-74 with four minutes

Then the W&L defense stiffen-
ed to shut out the Royals the
rest of the way while Norm
Kristoff threw in five of W&L’s
last seven points to put the
game away.

Greg Croghan led the Gen-
erals’ with 18 points. Six-foot-
nine sophomore Don Berlin
added 15, and Kristoff chipped
in with 14 points and 12 re-
bounds,

Bill Megginson and Pat Bopp
scored 14 points each for East-
ern Mennonite.

FEBRUARY 11—As was the
case the past two years, Lynch-
burg College was waiting for the
Generals to visit their gymnas-
ium, and responded with a 66-57
win to avenge an earlier loss to
W&L in Lexington Doremus Gym.

The Hornets won the game at
the foul line, sinking 24 of 36
charity tosses while W&L con-
nected on only three of their
seven foul shots.

While W&L controlled the
boards, 55-35, and got off more
shots from the field, they could
not get the big basket when they
needed it, and the Hornets
capitalized on several opportuni-
ties to pull away in the game’s
late minutes.

Freshman guard Tom Selinger
led the Hornets with 19 points.

Don Berlin scored 19 for W&L,
while John Podgajny added 18.

FEBRUARY 12—The basket-
ball Generals bounced back from
their loss at Lynchburg to re-
cord a 72-67 VCAA conference
win over Emory and Henry.

The win was the first on the
road for W&L snce they defeat-
ed Bridgewater on January 22
at Bridgewater. Since then the
Generals had dropped four
straight games away from Do-
remus Gym.

The Generals led by as many
as 15 points in the second half,
only to have several errors in

Wasps opportunities to close the
gap.

Guy Kerr led W&L with 16
points and eight rebounds. Greg
Croghan added 12 points while
John Podgajny chipped in 10.

W&L enjoyed its best shoot-
ing night in some time, hitting
on 50 percent of its shots from
the floor, while converting 24 of
34 from the foul line.

The win upped W&L’s confer-
ence-leading record to 5-0.

FEBRUARY 13 — W&L's
wrestling team _ started its
Florida trip by splitting a pair
of dual meets, beating Southern
Tech, 30-9 while dropping a 28-
3 decision to Maryville College.

Lee Keck (134), Brian Tray
(142), and Bill Cole (190) record-
ed pins for W&L against South-
ern Tech, while Howdy Knipp
(118), Don Overdorff (126), Jim

Crytzer (158), and Steve Sch-
weizerhof (HVY) scored de-
cisions.

Tray was the lone winner for
W&L against Maryville.

Meanwhile in Lexington fresh-
man swimmer John Hudson be-
gan his assault on the record
books as the Virginia Intercol-
legiate Swimming and Diving
Championships got underway.

Hudson set school, meet, and
state records in the 500-yard free-
style with a time of 4:44.27,
more than 10 seconds better
than second place finisher Mark
Kutz of Virginia Commonwealth.

Hudson's time is also the fast-
est recorded by a swimmer in
NCAA-Divisions II and III this
year.

Meanwhile sophomore Tad

The Executive Committee
voted Monday night, Feb. 10, to
replace the present public honor
trial procedure with an adversary
system by placing an E.C. mem-
ber in the hearing as “prosecu-
tor’ to present the case against
the accused.

The E.C. also voted to give the
transcript of the private E.C.
hearing to the defense and com-
mittee advocates but to withhold
it from the jury.

In another change the E.C.
decided to allow the advisors of
the accused to ask questions in
the public hearing instead of let-
ting only the accused himself
interrogate witnesses.

The E.C. based its authority to
make the changes on responses
to survey sheets circulated in a
three-month campaign to elicit
student opinion on the state of
the honor system. The survey
sheets were the only sizeable in-
put received by the committee
concerning the honor code.

Bird is a 1939 graduate of
Yale with a major in economics,
and joined Mobil in 1943. Before
assuming his current duties, he
was manager of marketing for
the company in Colombia, presi-
dent of Mobil’s Mexico subsidi-
ary, regional director for Latin
America and later for the Com-
mon Market nations, senior vice
president of the international di-
vision, vice president for Latin
America, and vice president for
the parent corporation in charge
of public affairs.

The particular fields of in-
terest Bird intends to explore
with students include needs,
junctions and future of multi-
national companies; relation-
ships between business and gov-
ernment, both generally and with
oil companies especially; special
problems with developing nations
and with peoples of other na-
tions; and business decision-mak-
ing on an international seale.

Bird also will provide an in-
sider’s view of the energy crisis—
how it developed, how it feels to
be “in the center of the storm,”
as he puts it, and “what seems
to be the way out of the prob-
lem” from both the domestic
and foreign points of view.

Bird says that after college, “I
deliberately chose a career in
international business—and I
was also especially attracted to
the oil business because of its
fundamental importance. Even
then energy seemed to me to be
indispensable and a sound basis
for a eareer,”

Street Week.” A live broadcast,
“Wall Street Week" deals with
controversial subjects, from
pornography to philosophy. John
J. Conner of the New York Times
once said that the show dealt
with “certain subjects that did
not lend themselves to television.”
Thus, the show seems to be
breaking the usual protocol and
reveling in the resulting static.
Rukeyser’s show has been called
“a refreshing change in a period
when television seems to be
weighed down with its own
technology.” Of his own show,
Mr. Rukeyser says, “I look at it
as a kind of Sesame Street for
erownups.”

Mr. Rukeyser was originally
scheduled to speak to the Com-
merce Fraternity on the after-
noon of his arrival, but this plan
has been cancelled owing to
transportation problems. He will,
however, arrive in Lexington in
time to attend the reception in
his honor at the Pi Kappa Alpha
house at 5:00 p.m.

é EC alters honor system

thirds majority that a two third
majority would be needed to pass
any motion for changes in the
honor system.

The first question considered
was whether appeals of E.C.
honor rulings should be public
or private. Sophomore repre-
sentative Sandy Stradtman cited
for purposes of debate that jurors
acting in public might tend to
judge the case from what they
thought the students wanted in-
stead of basing their decision on
the facts.

Stradtman mentioned that the
E.C. should consider whether
fairness to the accused should
take precedence over the educa-
tion to be ga’ned by the E.C. and
the students : a public trial. The
E.C. felt that publicity did not
compromise the equity of the
proceeding and voted unanim-
ously to keep the appeals public.

The group then turned to the
discussion of the need for a
prosecutor in public trials. Sec-
retary Mike Luttig argued
against the idea of an adversary
system, saying he would like to
keep “people against people”
situations out of the trials.

Senior representative Woody
Ray argued that the idea of a
publie trial was to give the ac-
cused a review of the case, not
to protect the E.Cc. and its
original ruling. He said those
members of the committee who
favored an adversary system were
acting “paranoid” and added, “I
don't feel threatened.”

Junior representative Robert
Pugh answered Luttig’s earlier
statement, saying the present
public trial system is a “circus
without the elephants” in that
it places the accused on one side
and places the jury both in the
middle and on the other side.
Vice-president Bob Keatley said
that the present system is basic-
ally a conflict between the de-
fendant and the transcript of
the E.C. hearing. He said the

defendant, with the help of his
advisors, could take testimony
from the transcript out of con-
text and create a “smokescreen”
around the actual meaning of the
original testimony.

The motion to have a prose-
cutor in the public trials carried
by a three-quarters majority,
with Luttig and Ray not voting.

Debate on the issue of who
should be prosecutor was based
on written propositions present-
ed by members of the E.C.
Senior Law representative Steve
Robinson gave an argument in
favor of choosing a prosecutor
independent of the E.C. The
argument said in part that the
public trial is as much “a trial
of the E.C. and its ruling” as it
is a trial of the accused.

Freshman Law representative
Everett Martin and Junior
Representative Leland McCul-
lough presented an argument in
favor of an E.C. member as
prosecutor. Martin said an E.C.
prosecutor would be “less theatri-
cal” and would “expedite the
trial” in that he would share the
defense advisor’s advantage of
having been at the original
hearing.

Straditman again played the
Devil's advocate, asking if an
independent prosecutor would do
any more or less good than an
E.C. representative. Keatley an-
swered that an _ independent
prosecutor would just be trying
the case before him, not “de-
fending his judgement.”

A motion that one or two E.C.
members should represent the
committee at public honor trials
was carried by another three-
quarters majority. Keatley and
Freshman representative Elliot
Hicks did not vote.

A motion concerning tran-
scripts of E.C. honor hearings
carried unanimously. The motion
allowed for transcripts of the
hearing to be given to the prose-
cutor and defendant for use in

Number 17

preparing their cases and also
in case testimony in the public
trial conflicted with that in the
original hearing.

The motion also provided that
the transcripts not be given to
the jury. This rule was passed
in the hope of giving the de-
fendant a new trial instead of
just rehashing the original evi-
dence.

The E.C. voted Monday night,
Feb. 17, to change the wording
of one of the questions asked of
prospective jurors for a public
honor trial and to allow unlimit-
ed questioning of jurors-design-
ate from both accused and E.C.
advocates.

The decision followed debate
over whether questioning the
ability of students to judge their
peers impartially was not in fact
challenging the honor of the
potential jurors, According to
Bob Keatley, the E.C. would be
“dealing with something that’s
dead in the first place” if they
had to question the integrity of
randomly selected jurors.

Mike Luttig followed up Keat-
ley’s objection, asking, “Is that
something the E.C. should con-
we don’t do it, no one will.” He
trol?” Steve Robinson replied, “If
cited the fact that four or five
jurors in an honor trial last
Spring were fraternity brothers
of the accused.

All E.C, members except Keat-
ley and Luttig voted to ask each
prospective juror, “Do you know
the accused personally?” instead
of the question now in the White
Book “Do you know the accused
well enough that you would judge
this matter differently than one
involving a total stranger?”

The E.C. also voted, with Keat-
ley oposed, to allow questions
from both sides during the
selection of jurors, and to allow
each side to reject two jurors
without cause. The decision to
allow two pre-emptory strikes
was carried unanimously.

Publications’ positions open

11 journalists to gather

for symposium on ethics

A four-day institute on journ-
alism ethics for working news-
men is set for next week here
as part of W&L's new program in
the professional ethies of journ-
alism.

Ben H. Bagdikian, assistant
managing editor and “ombuds-
man” of the Washington Post
until 1972, will deliver a public
address Monday evening and will
participate in workshops with
students and the visiting journ-
alists as part of the institute.

Bagdikian's lecture will be en-
titled “Is There Life After Water-
gate?” and will take place in
Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. Members
of the general public are in-
vited to attend at no charge.

The institute and Bagdikian's
visit to Washington and Lee
have been made possible by the
$300,000 grant to W&L from the
Lilly Endowment of Indianapolis.
That grant was designated to
establish programs in pre-profes-
sional ethics in law, medicine and
journalism and to establish a
similar program in the field of
the responsibilities of corpora-

tions in contemporary society.

The four-day program will al-
low eleven journalists and news-
men to investigate problems of
ethics—reflected in the value
judements they are required to
make on a day-to-day basis—in
an academic setting, making use
of W&L’'s library resources, and
the formal and informal activi-
ties of the program such as the
workshops and classes which are
part of W&L's journalism cur-
riculum.

As “ombudsman” at the Post,
Bagdikian was responsible for
evaluating and criticizing the
newspaper's performance as the
advocate of the readership. His
critical observations were fre-
quently published on the paper's
editorial page.

Among journalists participat-
ing in the institute will be four
W&L graduates—Lewis Cope of
the Minneapolis Tribune, Jay
Denny of WDBJ-TYV in Roanoke,
Raymond J. MeGrath of the
Charlottesville Daily Progress,
and Lawson H. Marshall of the
Lynchbure News,

tions should plan to appear
for an interview before the
Publications Board at a later
date to be announced.

Applications should in-
clude:

—A brief letter of intent
stating the position for which
you will apply.

—Ten copies of a personal

Big gapes characterize
Fancy Dress weekend

By PHILLIP HATCHETT

If the destruction of personal
property is in anyway indicative
of some really good gapes and
zood times then Fancy Dress "75
was probably the most successful
in history. The high number of
gapes seemed due to increases in
(1) police protection, i.e. radar,
(2) supplies of liquor; beer, grain
and house intoxicators and (3)
the additional day to the week-
end—a Thursday thru Sunday
affair.

After the initial reports were
received in the Co-op during
classes on Monday, the Phi de-
cided to conduct a preliminary
investigation. Basically the sur-
vey consisted of a call to each
fraternity house and get a report
from the nearest person to the
phone. This included house dam-
age and outstanding individual
loss.

The totals were rather impres-
sive.

80 plus windows broken

25 plus speeding tickets

$400 of articles stolen

8 pieces of furniture destroyed

7 cases of beer bottles broken

6 automobiles wrecked

5 plus bald tire tickets

4 plus violations for people on
to pof cars

2 plus wreckless driving charges

chimney removed

toilet ripped out

piano burned

piano top burned

fraternity door jumped

through

1 pair of glasses missing

1 band missing

1 pavilion entrance missing

The fraternities appeared to
specialize in gapes. Such was the
situation in the Beta Theta Pi
house, where after the first win-
dow was broken 41 followed. Con-
centrating on glass, the Beta's
crashed all seven cases of avail-
able beer bottles.

Phi Kappa Sigma likewise cen-
tered on one trait, swiftness. ‘We
got some speeding tickets—about
ten,” the informer said. He con-
tinued to explain that two of
the tickets belonged to the same
gentleman. Apparently, this
coachman received his first while
going to the pavilion and the
second one on his return trip.

ing evening on the American
legal system. Both addresses will
take place at 8 p.m. in Lee Cha-
pel, and both will be followed by
question-and-answer sessions.

The debate between T. Justine
Moore, president of Vepco since
1970, and David Brower, former
executive director of the Sierra
Club and now president of
Friends of the Earth, will take
place at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.
Again, a question-and-answer
session will follow.

Members of the public are in-
vited to attend both the talks and
the debate at no charge as guests
of the Washington and Lee stu-
dent body and the Interfrater-
nity Council, joint sponsors of
“Contact.”

Both speakers will tailor their
topic to the overall “Contact”
theme this year—"Critical Deci-
sions Facing America.” The
theme is derived from the name
of the organization established
by Nelson Rockefeller after he
left the governorship of New
York, before he was named vice
president.

Halberstam won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1964 for general report-
ing as a staff member of the New
York Times. He had previously
worked for newspapers in Missis-
sippi and Tennessee after his
graduation from Harvard.

His book “The Best and the
Brightest” is a well-researched
indictment of the Kennedy and
Johnson administration policies
that led to deep American in-
volvement in Indochina. The Sat-
urday Review called it “the most
important book on public policy”
when it was published in 1972.

Rehnquist was named to the
Supreme Court in 1971 (he was
nominated simultaneously with
Lewis F. Powell Jr., a Washing-
ton and Lee graduate and trus-
tee since 1961.

At 50, Rehnquist is the young-
est member of the Supreme
Court. He is generally considered
one of its most scholarly and ar-
ticulate justices—and one of the

Legal and medical ethics taught

by STEVE YEVICH
Phi Feature Editor

Washington and Lee's experi-
mental ethics program currently
includes courses in medical ethics
and legal ethics as well as the
course in journalism which was
discussed several weeks ago in
the Ring-tum Phi.

The intent of these interde-
partmental courses, administer-
ed under the program called

Society and the Professions,” is
to subject pressing questions of
human values pertaining to these
professions to close academic
scrutiny, thereby sharpening the
student's perception of his own
field and of ethical choices with
which he will be confronted dur-
ing his career,

These two courses are similarly

tructured, with frequent class
seminars, several lectures pet

semester delivered by men ac-
complished in each field, and a
four-day symposium held on
campus for a select group of
practicing professionals.

The course on medical ethics,
to be taught in the spring term
by Dr. Hodges, co-ordinator of
the program, will focus on the
changes being wrought in the
profession by rapidly developing

technology and shifting social
mores. How should it be decided
who may live on this already

overcrowded planet’? When does
life begin? Is abortion ethically
acceptable. or is the right to life
a valid precept? How should
death be defined? With many
amazing types of life-supporting
machines in existence in limited
numbers, who decides who will
receive their use? How does one
reconcile the urgent need for
cientific experimentation with

inherent in using
humans for such experiments?
Should genetic engineering be
allowed? What should be done to
prevent the maldistribution of
scarce medical resources in soc-
lety?

These are
dilemmas

the dangers

some of the moral
facing physicians
everywhere; these are problems
with no pat answers. For ex-
ample, take a man suffering with
a terminal kidney disease: should
ust be given some morphine
to relieve the pain as he dies?
Should he be allowed the use of
a hemodialysis unit? Should he
be given a kidney transplant? If
o, why should he be given the
chance for a new life rather than
enother patient? To what extent
should he be allowed to deter
mine the nature of his treat-
ment?

and president three years later.

He is chairman of the Virginia

the nation.

Vhen Brower and some mem-
bers of the Sierra Club clashed
over proposals to construct nu-

Fancy Dress festivities
prove profitable to SAB

by JAM ES MASON

The Student Center has be-
come a bleak modern building
with white plaster walls and busy
people once again. The Starlight
Club is no more. All the blue
paper, tiny lights, long dresses,
and formal wear have disappear-
ed from the halls. That night of
elegance and spectacle known as
Fancy Dress "75 is now a thing of
the past.

Slumping Cagers
invited to play
NCAA _ tourney

The Phi News Staff

Through a strange set of cir-
cumstances, Washington and
Lee's basketball Generals have
received and accepted a bid to
the NCAA-Division III basket-
ball championships.

W&L will be the host of the
South Atlantic Regional, which
will be played March 7-8 in
Doremus Gym.

The Generals will host Glass-
boro State (N.J.) in the second
game of a doubleheader on Fri-
day the seventh. North Carolina
Methodist will take on William
Paterson (N.J.) College in the
first game.

The winners of the Friday
games will meet Saturday night
at 9:00 in the championship
game. The losers square off in a
consolation game at 7 p.m

Wé&L was informed of getting
a bid late Tuesday afternoon by
the NCAA selection Committee.

The Generals, who knew last
week that a win over either Ran-
dolph-Macon or Madison was a
necessity for a chance at a bid,
felt that their hopes for post-
season action were ended when
they lost both of these games
‘see page 3)

However Lynchburg College
who earlier had appeared to have
the inside track on the bid, was
removed from consideration when
it was learned that one of the
players transfer student
who, though eligible to play
made a sizable contribution to
the Hornets’ season, thus remov-
them from any consideration
lor the tournament

Should the Generals win the
regional tourney, they would also
host the quarterfinal game, most
likely to be played on March 11

rhe Division II finals are
cheduled for Mareh 14-15 in
Reading, Pa

Although the visible signs of
Fancy Dress have gone, the me-
mory of the affair still lingers on,
especially with the Student Ac-
tivities Board Chairmen David
Mathews and John Killpack. If
the evening proved profitable for
those out for a good time, it
proved even more practical to the
SAB in terms of dollars and
cents.

The leaders of the SAB esti-
mate that they may have taken
in as much as $9000. They had
earlier speculated that their sale
of tickets would bring them only
$6000. The weekend cost the SAB
close to $13,000 when they had
estimated its cost to be about
$12,000 prior to the event.

The Chairmen of the Student
Activities Board have thus come
up with around $2000-$3000 to
add to their budget. This amount
will be placed in the entertain-
ment fund of the SAB and will
be used to sponsor a concert in
the spring, if all goes well.

John Killpack stated that ap-
proximately 1200 tickets were
given out or sold, which means
that roughly 2,155 people were
there for the festivities. Nearly
90°° of the gentlemen appeared

in formal wear and almost every
lady in attendance followed suit.

The hoards drank their fill,
which is perfectly obvious to any-
one who was there. Thirty-eight
kegs of beer were consumed in
the course of the evening which
testifies to the state of the crowd.

All in all, the weekend proved
itself a success. What is in store
for next year? Well, it is a bit
early to tell, but if Fancy Dress
keeps accelerating at the pace es-
tablished in the last two years, it
might once again achieve na-
tional status as the social event
of the east coast.

A remembrance of things past

 

There have been some changes made, not the least of which was the remodeling of the front portal of
Zollman’s Pavilion. By Sunday the facility had become so crowded with students, dates, and miscel-
laneous debris from the last three days that the situation was intolerable. In what must be one of the
most memorable gapes in the history of Fancy Dress, one enterprising student decided to enlarge the

door by driving his car through the entry and into the building.

Thank you

Last weekend was a true revival of Fancy Dress. The Stu-
dent Activities Board expended a great deal of its time and
effort to make this year's Ball the best in recent history. In
this the members of the Student Activities Board surpassed
themselves.

Not only were we pleased by the performance of the SAB,
but we were relieved to see how generously the student body
supported the venture. In the end result it was as much the stu-
dent body which made Fancy Dress '75 a success as it was
anyone else. Its enthusiasm made Fancy Dress work and has
hopefully insured the resurrection of W&L’s traditional social
event of the year.

Especially heartening was the fact that the students decid-
ed to do it big, do it right and give it class, An example of this
can be seen in the fact that almost every single person at the
affair arrived in formal dress. Those who attended in anything
less were in the smallest of minorities. We think everyone was
happy to see that so many students had gone out of their way
to make Fancy Dress work,

\fter slapping everyone on the back, we feel that there ts
still room for a little constructive criticism, The grain party
organized by the freshman class was not handled as well as it
might have been. It is fortunate that it is nearly impossible to
jurn a grain party into a complete disaster for the organizers
did about as much wrong as they possibly could have.

The main problem that one can encounter at a grain Party
is a lack of grain punch, This was the case last Saturday when
it became impossible to get grain after a certain point,
Whether the people in charge ran out of supplies or simply de
cided to stop serving, the point is that there was not enough
grain available. Along the same line, that which was prov ided
was about as weak as pink lemonade. The freshmen should

have been more generous and better organized,

In spite of this weak link, the weekend was quite a success,

and for that we have only ourselves to thank,

Letter to the Editor...

Wahoos react to W&L pranks

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi

I thought about writing this
letter earlier this year but did not
hesitate when I discovered that a
second incident of vandalism oc-
curred on a work of art which
peaks the staircase of the North
side of the Rotunda at the Uni-
versity of Virginia. As you know
the Rotunda is being restored.
Mr. Jefferson's original design
will once again come alive within
the shell of this historical and
architectural pheonmenon.

Last spring, a mural was paint-
ed by a team of University stu-
dents portraying Mr. Jefferson.
It was known as the “Construc-

tive Graffiti Project’ and its pur-
pose was to better the condition
of the boards surrounding the
Rotunda and hinder vandals.

The mural emphasized the in-
terminable importance of Mr.
Jefferson here at the University
and symbolically recognizes those
honoraries and societies which
in their own efforts further the
ideals of Mr. Jefferson.

Our tribute to Mr. Jefferson
has been invaded twice by Wash-
ington & Lee students who
thought it important to remind
us of the W&L-U.Va. lacrosse
game last year. If in fact the out-
come of the game is considered

by W&L students as a sacred
event in Washington and Lee
history and worth the disgusting
damage on our bicentennial sa-
lute, then the joke is on Wash-
ington & Lee University. We feel
that our efforts were indeed re-
spected by the University Com-
munity. It’s too bad W&L
couldn't join us in our tribute to
a great Virginian.

Not only was the mural dam-
aged but the marble steps of the
Rotunda are now ruined. The
Wé&L artists chose not to abide
by the basic academics of tidi-
ness and good taste. This inflic-
tion caused by spilled buckets of

Chinese paper cuttings to be placed
on display in duPont Hall next week

Twenty colorful “paper cutt-
ing” art pieces by a 76-year-old
Chinese grandmother, Teng Yun-
Chang, will be on display with
cuttings by many other Chinese
artists March 1 through 8 in du-
Pont Gallery.

The exhibition, currently on a
tour through the United States,
represents a small part of the
famous collection of Chinese folk

wan's College of Chinese Culture
and a “panoramic show” of con-
temporary Chinese brush paint-
ing, also on an American tour
sponsored by the National Mu-
seum of History.

Paper cutting is an ancient
Chinese art. Initially the cuttings
were used as patterns for silk
embroidery, tapestries or other
stitching work, but they have be-
come an independent art form as
well.

paint and uncontrollable paint
brushes is a criminal offense.
Paint can not be removed from
marble. The paint was spilled in
such large quantities, certain
marble slabs may have to be re-
placed. Whoever was involved in
this senseless project will cer-
tainly see their signature on this
historical monument for years.
Incidentally, the Rotunda is NOT
a STOP sign! The Rotunda
stands as the center of the Uni-
versity Mr. Jefferson designed
and founded ‘one of the three
things Mr. Jefferson wanted to
be remembered by). We think it
is a disgrace that certain people
think a 13-11 score is just as im-
portant.

Both Washington & Lee and the
University of Virginia are in-
stitutions of academic excellence
and fine historical tradition.
Both will be important centers
for the Bicentennial. It’s a shame
that the few from W&L involved
with the childish incidents des-
cribed, make it impossible for
both institutions to coincide in
respect and pride for the Jeffer-
son ideal.

Lacrosse preview:
a strong attack;
a ? at midfields

(Ed. note: This is the first of
two articles on the upcoming
W&L lacrosse season by Phi
Sports Editor Bill Flesher. This
week Flesher talks with Generals’
head coach Jack Emmer about
the team at the offensive end of
the field. Next week the discus-
sion centers on the defense and
the season ahead.)

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

Take away three All-Americans
and several other key players
from a lacrosse team that came
within a heartbeat of playing in
the national championship game
last season and one has to ask
how that team might respond to
some new ideas about how the
game is played.

But if the man you ask that
question to is Washington and

 

Washington and Lee “unof-
ficially” opens its 1975 lacrosse
season Saturday when they
host the Chesapeake Lacrosse
Club in an exhibition game at
2 p.m. on Wilson Field.

Several old friends will be
returning for the game, which
has no bearing on the Gen-
erals’ season record.

Among them are two of last
year’s All-Americans, goalie
Skeet Chadwick and midfield-
er Ted Bauer.

Also playing for Chesapeake
are John Hopkins stars Bill
Nolan, Mike Siegert, and Bob
Barbera, and former Mary-
land standout Dave Dempsey.

 

 

 

Lee lacrosse coach Jack Emmer,
the answers flow like a river.

“We don’t expect to replace
the people we lost,” said the
three-time Coach-of-the-Year in
an interview Monday. “We are
simply going to make the most
out of the people we do have and
try to be successful with them.”

The shadows of All-Americans
Skeet Chadwick, Ted Bauer, Skip
Lichtfuss, Jim Farrar, and Bryan
Chasney will hang over Wilson
Field for quite some time in the
minds of W&L lacrosse fans, but
not in the mind of the team’s
coaches and players.

“We'll be doing things much
differently than we did with
players like Bauer and Licht-
fuss,’ Emmer said. “But again,
we feel that we have the players
to change our look.”

In the past, Emmer said, the
Generals have relied to a great
extent on control at the midfield,
where Bauer and Lichtfuss were
almost unstoppable. Now things
may move up to the attack for
offensive control.

“With the three attackmen we

have, we find it hard to believe
that all of them can have a bad
day on the same day,’ Emmer
said .

Two of the team’s tri-captains,
All-American Dave Warfield and
Don Carroll, return to the front-
line while junior Rob Morgan,
who sat out last year after trans-
ferring from Air Force, where he
led the nation in scoring his
freshman year, will replace
Chasney as the third attackman.

Emmer called the W&L attack
“a very flexible unit, with the
ability to run both a rotating
style of play as well as the set
patterns with a man on the
crease.”

But the big question mark, as
Emmer himself admits, lies at
the midfields, where graduation
hit the Generals the hardest.

Four of the top nine middies
were seniors last year, while four
others were just freshmen. Only
Ken Miller, one of two seniors on
this year’s team, has a class
standing above sophomore at the
midfields.

“We are terribly young at the
midfields,”’” Emmer said. “But we
are relying on our experienced
players to help bring our fresh-
men along.”

The four sophomore middies
who saw extensive action last
year, Jay Monahan, Ralph Baug-
her, Mick Kohlenstein, and Jack
Dudley, will team with Miller to
anchor the midfields.

Several freshmen, including
Scott Baugher, Ralph's younger
brother, Mark Derbyshire, Jay
Sindler, Bob Flannery, Brian
Tray, and Charlie Stieff, are
fighting for the remaining mid-
field spots along with sophs Mark
Krieger, Bob Raber, and Doug
Fuge.

All ten Washington and Lee
wrestlers stayed out of the los-
ing column last Wednesday as
the Generals trounced Hamp-
den-Sydney, 44-1, in a dual meet

Tankmen scare Duke
before falling, 60-52

Washington and Lee's swimm-
ers shook off the “Morning Af-
ter Fancy Dress Blahs” long
enough to give visiting Duke a
scare before the Blue Devils pull-
ed away to a 60-52 dual meet
win Saturday in the Generals’
season finale.

WA&L picked up the bulk of its
points in the freestyle events, as
state champion John Hudson
scored a triple in the 200-, 500-,
and 1000-yard freestyles, while
Tad Van Leer added a double in
the 50- and 100-yard freestyles.

took a first in the 200-yard but-
terfly.

One school record was set when
junior Rod Scott clocked a 2:-

to break his own record by one-
half of a second.

The meet was up for grabs un-
til Duke pulled off one-two fin-
ishes in the 200-yard breast-
stroke and three-meter diving.

The loss gave W&L a 9-3 dual
meet mark for the year. Several
swimmers, including Hudson,
Van Leer, and members of the
400- and 800-yard freestyle re-
lay teams will now get ready for
the NCAA-Division ITI champion-
ship meet March 20-22 in Mead-
ville, Pa.

Generals drop pair
but still receive

NCAA tourney bid

The same Washington and Lee
basketball team that was once
12-2 and on its way to the NCAA
College Division tournament saw
any hopes for post-season ac-
tion ended by two state rivals
last week.

The Generals, who had been
informed early in the week by
the NCAA Tournament Selection
Committee that a win in either
of their last two games would
guarantee strong consideration at
selection time, stayed with the
fourth-ranked small college team
in the nation, Randolph-Macon,
for nine-tenths of the game be-
fore falling, 67-62 on Wednesday,
then saw the roof cave in as
Madison waltzed to the Virginia
College Athletic Association
(‘VCAA) Eastern Division title in
a 77-57 win.

The pair of losses left W&L
with a 15-10 season mark, and,
while it did give head coach
Verne Canfield his ninth straight
winning season, it meant that the
Generals had dropped eight of
their last eleven games while
struggling for wins in the other
three.

The final week in review:

The Generals caught Ran-
dolph-Macon at just the right
time, as the Yellow Jackets were
coming off an exhausting double
overtime loss to Old Dominion
just two nights earlier.

But it took just 25 seconds for
R-MC to pile up the points that
made the difference in the out-
come, as All-American candidate
Fletcher Johnson, on the bench
most of the second half with four
fouls, hit five straight points to
break a 56-all deadlock with 2:-
47 left.

After that the two teams trad-
ed trips to the free throw line,
and, while W&L hit six of eight
and twice pulled within two
points, the Yellow Jackets an-
swered with a like manner of

charity tosses to hold the Gen-
erals off.

W&L jumped out to an early
12-6 lead, but couldn’t hold it for
long as R-MC popped in eight
straight points to take a 14-12
lead with 13 minutes left in the
first half.

From there the teams traded
one- and two-point leads, with
the Yellow Jackets taking a 36-
34 lead at intermission.

W&L came back behind the
shooting of Greg Croghan to take
a 42-40 lead four minutes into
the second half. But again R-
MC rallied, as sophomore Joey
Allen keyed a 9-3 spurt ot put the
visitors on top 49-46.

Then Johnson picked up his
fourth foul with 13:21 left, and,
with the 26 points per game scor-
er on the bench, W&L forged
back to a 54-54 tie with 5:58 to
go.
The two teams then displayed
excellent defense, holding each
other scoreless for more than two
minutes until Croghan hit a
jumper with 3:45 to go to put
W&L on top, 56-54,

But then Johnson came back
in, hit a three-point play, fol-
lowed it up with a driving layup,
and watched as Allen made a
steal and a layup to put the Yel-
low Jackets on top 61-56 with
2:25 left.

Then the teams walked up and
down the court for foul shooting
practice, which did little to af-
fect the outcome of the game.

Allen led the Yellow Jackets
with 19 points and 11 rebounds,
while Johnson, who fouled out
with 1:41 to play, ended up with
15 points.

Croghan led the Generals with
19 points, while Norm Kristoff
added 10 points and 10 rebounds.

EC makes procedural
changes in White Book

By JOE FITZGERALD
Phi News Staff

The Executive Committee vot-
ed Monday to ask the Chairman
of the Student Bar Association
to begin all public honor trials
within five days of a defendant’s
appeal of his conviction by the
E.C.

The President of the SBA is
made chairman of all public
trials according to the White
Book and can allow up to fifteen
days before the trial, following
an appeal.

The E.C. also voted to allow the
defendant in a private honor
hearing to ask for a suspension
after six hours of testimony. The
hearing will resume at the dis-
cretion of the President.

Most of the meeting was con-
sumed by discussion of what Le-
land McCullough called “little-
bitty changes” in wording and
procedure in the White Book.
The E.C. will ask the faculty to
come up with some sort of stand-
ard specific pledge to cover all
work done at W&L. No rule was
passed on a proposal that wit-
nesses in an honor trial not be
allowed to talk to each other
before the proceeding.

Also, possible honor violations
will be investigated by three
members of the E.C. instead of
the president and two other
members as presently required.
The E.C. also voted to change the
19th word in the first sentence of
the third paragraph of section I
of the White Book to read “of”
instead of “by.” Following this

of the stolen items. This consist-
ed mainly of the house compo-
site.

The most diversified attack on
belongings came from a group
on Washington St. Its week-
end saw one toilet fly out the
house, one dive through a door in
Wahoo fashion, and a car thro-
ugh the pavilion. Added to the
unusual was the usual; several
windows broken and a little fur-
niture damage.

On the inter-fraternity front,
Saturday night, Lambda Chi Al-
pha seemed to loose their party
to the Sigma Nus. No band came
to the Nu house, so they took
charge of the action at the
Lambda Chi headquarters. Fin-
ally, the Sigma Chi’s, that group
of hellions, kept in typical form.
Their weekend was high-lighted
by the finding and returning of
an SAE’s wallet and checkbook.

What all this says about a
W&L student's respect for the
value of money does not bear
repeating. The education we re-
ceive on the weekends is price-
less.

Famous jazz trumpeter Don Ellis

to perform with W&L Ensemble

Phi News Staff

The big band jazz sound will
be heard in Lexington once again
this week as the renowned jazz
trumpeter Don Ellis pays a visit
to W&L. Ellis will spend Friday
working with the Washington
and Lee Jazz Ensemble, and he
and the group will perform at 8
p.m. Friday night in Lee Chapel.
There is no admission charge for
this public concert.

Such numbers as “Green-
sleeves” and “Eli’s Comin’” will
be featured in the performance,
sponsored by the W&L Concert
Guild, the Student Activities
Board, and Mu Beta Psi, the
W&L music fraternity.

Ellis, a native of Los Angeles,
has studied under such compos-
ers as Gardner Read, Stephan
Wolpe and John Vincent. He has
played with the bands of Glenn
Miller, Maynard Ferguson, Lionel

Hampton, and Woody Herman.
His own group has appeared at
the Newport Jazz Festival, the
Monterey Jazz Festival, Lincoln
Center, and Basin Street West,
to name a few well-known spots.

Ellis wrote the score for the
movie “The French Connection,”
and for his efforts received the
1972 Grammy Award for best in-
strumental arrangement of the
year.

By artful application of com-
pound rythms, Ellis has succeed-
ed in breaking away from the
square-time groove of conven-
tional jazz. He has experimented
with the musical resources of the
Indian ragas, unusual scale for-
mations, and complicated time
signatures. He has even had a
special trumpet built for himself
capable of producing quarter-
tones, notes that are found in-
between the normal twelve notes
in an octave.

There are no obvious correct
answers. What Dr. Hodges at-
tempts to do is to encourage the
student to identify and define the
problem sharply in terms of a
basic value conflict, and illustr-
ate it succinctly. Then some pos-
sible ways of resolving the im-
passe are proposed; for example,
the existence of pertinent legis-
lation, or previous attempts at a
viable solution. If spontaneous
debate does not develop, Dr.
Hodges takes a definite stand on
the matter to provoke members
of the class into trying to destroy
his position. “One of the best
ways to elicit student response is
to outline your own conclusions;
a clearly stated position fre-
quently arouses them to attack,
refine, and restate your pro-
posal,”’ he says. “Of course, final
answers are utterly impossible,
for there can be no clear unmix-
ed ‘good’ thing one should do.”

The legal ethics course, con-
ducted jointly by Dr. Hodges, Dr.
Lowry and President Huntley, is
exploring a variety of imposing
problems facing the legal profes-
sion, some of which have not
been adequately resolved since
the inception of law itself. Stu-
dents are grappling with issues
such as possible revisions in the
American Bar Association's code
of ethical responsibility, the pro-
per place of the lawyer in an ad-
versary system of justice, and the
true nature of justice itself.

Also to be pondered are prob-
lems with the privilege against
self-incrimination, the proper
determination of what consti-
tutes admissible evidence, positi-
vism versus naturalism in the
realm of jurisprudence, conflicts
of interest among judge, lawyer
and prosecutor, and the possible
effects of the Equal Protection
Clause on the availability of legal
services to all sectors of society.

The program in applied ethics
is being funded with a $300,000
grant from the Lilly Foundation
of Indianapolis. Three years have
been designated as the trial per-
iod during which the program
will be constantly evaluated. If
those involved find the end re-
sults sufficiently impressive, the
program wil be continued, hope-
fully in its present form. Owing
to the considerable expense in-
volved in organizing both the lec-
tures and the symposia for each
course, the continued existence
of the program after the first
three years will depend on the
support the program receives
from other outside sources. It is
not expected at this time that
the Lilly Foundation will con-
tinue to fund the program inde-
finitely.

The ethics program as it now
stands is an excellent model to
study and evaluate for further
applications. Such a program
could easily be expanded into
other professional fields, includ-
ing business, scientific research,
and politics. These courses would
help develop a much-neglected
area of our curriculum, that of
applied ethics, morals and value
judgment. Too often the college
student leaves the campus with-
out a sufficient understanding of
the basic values of society and
how they will affect his daily
professional life—an
seminar program, while expen-
sive to maintain, would presum-
ably be of great benefit to the
student who participates. Hope-
fully this is the conclusion that
Dr. Hodges and his colleagues
will draw.

Restrictions loosened

on academic probation

By JIM NORTON

A proposal to allow students on
academic probation to hold elec-
tive or appointive positions was
approved by the faculty at their
monthly meeting Monday after-
noon.

The proposal limits students
on academic probation to one ex-
tra-curricular activity but now
allows that activity to be an elec-
tive or appointive office. This
differs from the former rule that
prohibited students on academic
probation from holding any posi-
tion to which one is elected or
appointed.

The proposal, submitted by the
faculty Executive Committee,
differs from the proposal sub-
mitted by the student Executive
Committee that asked for the re-
moval of all restrictions on stu-
dents on academic probation.

In other action the faculty ap-
proved a request from Phi Beta
Kappa to have shortened classes
on March 25 to enable them to
have an assembly. The speaker
at the assembly will be Dr.
Claude 8S. George, Associate Dean
of the School of Business Ad-
ministration at the University of

North Carolina, according to Dr.
DeVogt, faculty advisor of Phi
Beta Kappa.

The faculty also rejected two
different proposals to change the
exam schedule for this term.
Both proposals asked for a
change of the starting date of
exams to Saturday, March 29.

The faculty approved some
course changes, which included
the dropping of Interdepartmen-
tal 302, 303 and 340 in the Spring.
Other changes approved were in
music, drama, economics, French,
computer science and Chinese
courses.

Larry Lyles spoke before the
faculty and thanked them for
their co-operation with the stu-
dent curriculum survey. He said
the results of the fall survey will
be available soon and that the
winter term survey will run from
the 17th to the 21st of March.

The faculty Courses and De-
erees Committee reported that it
is still studying a proposal by Le-
land McCullough, Bill Garrison,
and Robert Pugh to permit stu-
dents to take 9 credits in a 12
week term, if this will not delay
their graduation. The committee
is expected to report next month.

and Sandy Stradtman is running
unopposed for the office of Sec-
retary.

Campaign regulations for the
candidates were set concerning
posters and expenditures. 50 812”
x 11” posters will be allowed each
person running and five larger
displays such as banners and
skywriting. Posters and platforms
displayed together at fraternity
houses will count as one poster.

Candidates will be allowed to
spend $15 each. Expense lists will
be due in the E.C. room by Sun-
day night. Contributions from
others must be counted on the
candidates’ lists. All campaign
regulations will apply to all can-
didates, including write-ins.

Voting will be open to all stu-
dents including seniors and ex-
change students. Polling places
will be located in the Co-op, the
Quad, and Washington and
Tucker Halls.

In other business, John Kill-
pack, speaking for the Student
Activities Board, reported that
the SAB spent $4000 instead of
$6000 on Fancy Dress Weekend.
The SAB also reiterated its re-
quest for $500 to cover bills left
over from last year's film com-
mittee. The E.C. deferred a de-
cision on the funds until a later
date.

The E.C. also went on record as
supporting the Generals in this
weekend's basketball game.

The E.C. also deferred a deci-
sion on what action, if any, to
take concerning student behavior
at Lacrosse games. Ben Bailey
noted that two other schools con-
sidered dropping W&L from their
schedules because of the poor be-
havior of the students. Bailey
noted that this might be con-
sidered an honor violation since
students at the games are not
conducting themselves as gentle-
man.

Drama academy promotes Kahn

By the Phi News Staff

Lee Kahn, assistant fine arts
professor and director of the
University Theatre, is the new
executive vice president of The
American Academy of Dramatic
Arts of New York City.

In that capacity, Kahn has
charge of overseeing professional
training in acting in the school's
two divisions, in New York and
in Pasadena, Calif. He has over-
all responsibility for the hiring of
faculty, for controlling the qual-
ity of instruction, and for devel-
oping the budget. Also as part of
his duties he will be contacting
prominent producers and direc-

tors to arrange auditions and in-
terviews for students of the
school.

The branch in Pasadena, which
only opened in October, will ab-
sorb much of Kahn's time spent
on Academy business. He was in-
volved in the final stages of ne-
gotiations prior to the opening
of the “West Coast Campus,”
and will devote a good deal of
time to getting it established on
a firm basis .

As an example of some of his
more pleasant duties, Kahn will
be travelling to California in
several weeks to attend a benefit
organized by Sammy Davis, Jr..

Kahn will be “commuting” to
New York and Pasadena fre-
quentiy on weekends. This tra-
vel will not conflict with any of
his drama classes here, since he
holds no Friday classes and will
normally return on Sunday even-
ings.

University Theatre productions
will still command top priority in
Kahn's schedule. He has made it
clear that he will not allow his
Academy functions to interefer
with preparations for W&L dra-
ma productions.

Kahn's appointment to this
post will have some effects on
this campus, however. The stu-
dents here “will be the recipients
of an awful lot of good things as
a result of my promotion,” says
Kahn. Continually in contact
with many of the great names in
American theatre. cinema, and
television, he will be presented
with numerous opportunities to
suggest to some of them to “drop
by Lexington for informal
workshops and presentations.
The added exposure W&L will
receive in the inner circles of the
dramatic world will certainly do
no harm.

The Academy is the nation’s
oldest professional drama-train-
ine school, having been founded
in 1884. and is the only institu-
lion in the nation devoted purely
to training in acting. Through an

Kilpatrick’s interests are not

“Number One Pea, pro tem” of

even by Communists.

The Contact series has spon-
sored addresses by Supreme

analyst Louis Rukeyser, and a

tween Vepco President T. Justin

The theme with which each
speaker has dealt, from varying
angles, is “Critical Choices Fac-
ing America.’ Taken from the

has brought to the student's at-

ment and the economy.

Law, business,
and medicine
career choices

Law, business and medicine are
again the leading choices among
W&L freshmen when asked their
probable career plans.

The figure for lawyers is more
than four times the national
average among men at four-year
institutions. As it usually is, the
figure for future businessmen is
about the same as the national
men's norm; and, again follow-
ing the traditional pattern,
Washington and Lee's figure for
medicine is just about twice the
national men's average.

Politically, almost a quarter
of the freshmen class characteriz-
ed themselves as “liberal,” al-
most exactly the same as the na-
tional men's average at four-year
colleges. But almost 33 per cent
described themselves as ‘“con-
servative’ — more than twice
the nationwide average, 15 per
cent, among men in similar in-
stitutions.

Asked why they chose Wash-
ington and Lee, 85.9 per cent said
the university's “good academic
reputation” was a “very impor-
tant” reason. Nationally, 55.9 per
cent of male freshmen said they
had picked their college for that
reason.

Each fall, entering students at
W&L and at about 30 other four-
year colleges and universities
throughout the nation are asked
to indicate their career aims as
they see them at the moment.
The survey was conducted by the
American Council on Education
in cooperation with UCLA.

The Choice

We have reached that point in the school year when we are
asked to vote for the President of the student government. As
was the case last year, the coming elections are definitely not
the most exciting thing on the school calendar, At least we can
be thankful that we have alternatives in the election for
President of the Student Body.

Mr. McCullough faces Mike Luttig in the race for Presi-
dent. Both candidates are members of this year’s Executive
Committee, but we do not want to be completely negative.
Their experience should have given them some insight into
student government and the duties of the office they seek.

Nevertheless, we regret that the choice presented to the
students is not more clearly defined. Both gentlenmen are con-
scientious and will probably discharge their duties well, Un-
fortunately, both are very much alike in their perspectives on
student body issues. This is not to say that we disagree with
their views indicated elsewhere on this page, but we do wish
the contrast was more dramatic. Deciding which one to vote
for is something like trying to distinguish between blue violet
and violet blue in a box of Crayola Crayons.

There is, however, a subtle difference between the two
candidates. In the recent discussions by the EC on possible
changes to the honor system, Mr. Luttig often appeared the
more idealistic of the two. He frequently showed a tendency
to disregard, or at least overlook, the practical problems which
arise in administering the Honor System and to treat it as a
sacred cow. On the other hand, Mr. McCullough showed more
concern with making the Honor System grounded in reality.
His suggestions were practical, treating the Code as something
which had to be realistic and workable above all,

This difference in perspective is really all we have to go
on in deciding for whom we should vote. We are lucky that,
although our choice is limited, the candidates both appear
competent and willing to serve, Please keep in mind that the
administration of the Honor System is the most important
duty of the EC. Whether one wants to see the Honor System
treated practically or idealistically is the important factor.
Whatever, do take the time to vote in next Monday’s elections.

Letters to th

Macon girls complain;
disregard for Pines
creates unpleasantness

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

In response to an increase in
significant damages to both the
Pines houses and Smith Ban-
quet Hall as of January, 1975, we
feel it is necessary to specify to
all Randolph-Macon students
and their guests the rules and
responsibilities associated with
the use of these facilities.

During the month of January,
of which the college was in ses-
sion only two weeks, the total
cost of damage to the Pines was
$143.67. It is not the responsibil-
ity of the college to absorb these
costs, As stated in the R-M Stu-
dent Handbook under Student
Government Social Regulations,
Section B, 4c:

“... If any damage is report-

ed the girl who signed out

the key is subject to action
by the Dorm President's

Council and will be required

to pay for these damages.”

Unfortunately for the R-M
student, such damages are most
often the result of unruly be-
bavior on the part of their guests.
In some cases these guests (Le.
Fraternities) have assumed re-
sponsibility for the damages and
have paid the bill for the girl, It

Business Manager
DAVID R. LEE

....., Paul J. Lancaster

is hoped all such damages and
thus costs can be avoided in the
future.

Although the Pines houses are
in need of renovation to make
them more suitable for entertain-
ing, the Administration will not
provide the necessary funds un-
til a greater respect for the pro-
perty is exhibited by all students
and guests.

Recently, Smith Hall has also
been subject to damage during
social functions. Those of us who
sponsor activities hope to pre-
vent further destruction by sup-
port of the following:

1. Those persons displaying
behavior deemed unman-
ageable by the group
sponsoring the event will
not be admitted, and

2. Persons whose behavior
becomes unmanageable
during the course of the
event will be asked to
leave.

It is hoped the preceeding will
encourage all those concerned to
re-evaluate the responsibilities
involved in participation in any
and all social activities at Ran-
dolph-Macon in the future.

Respectfully,

lated the newly adopted adver-
sary system with an EC prose-
cutor and the tightened jury se-
lection procedures which ensure
an unbiased jury. I also suggest-
ed various other technical im-
provements.

BUDGET—I saved several hun-
dred dolars by convincing the
university to fund the Student
Recruitment Committee. I am
presently working with the Uni-
versity Treasurer to save another
$1,000. Next year I would like to
implement a system to allow stu-
dents to devote $5 of their stu-
dent body tax to any activity
they deem beneficial to W&L.

CURRICULUM — Two other
students and I have devised a
plan, now under consideration by
the faculty, to allow students
with a heavy load to take 9 cred-
its in a 12 week term.

ATHLETES—I have secured
the Athleic Department's un-
animous approval for P.E. courses
in outing activities, like camping,
hiking, canoeing, and hunting.

ALUMNI—I have been working
to improve student-alumni rela-
tions by having 1) a recent gra-
duate serve on the Alumni Board
of Directors, 2) a student report-
er for the Alumni magazine, and
3) students speak at alumni
gatherings and participate in
fund-raising trips.

TOWN-GOWN RELATIONS —
I am working with the Develop-
ment Office on a spring “open
house” to improve university-
community relations.

I firmly believe that I have
made significant efforts in a wide
range of areas to improve life at
W&L. Please keep these in mind.
I would appreciate your vote on
Monday.

Thank you,

The individual chosen as Stu-
dent Body President should pos-
sess a set of attributes which re-
sult in his being liked and im-
portantly, respected. Essential are
skills in conveying student con-
cerns in public and at admini-
strative meetings. And needed is
a well-organized person with a
seriousness which indicates an
awareness of the importance of
the position. He must be able and
willing to work long hours, yet
maintain with those he repre-

sents an association which will
encourage the exchange of opi-
nions. These leadership qualities
must not be dismissed when
choosing your President.

The suggesting of new legisla-
tion is vital in student govern-
ment. But, ideas are only bene-
ficial when coupled with an abil-
ity to effectively relate them to
other persons. Major changes or
modifications should be based on
reliable information. For this
reason the effects of honor sys-
tem changes and of coeducation
at other Universities must be
thoroughly examined to avoid
haphazard decisions should the
need for change arise. Equally
important is communication and
if elected I will establish regu-
lar meeting times with both the
student bar President and the
fraternity Presidents to improve
student input.

As Secretary, my accomplish-
ments are such that they do not
lend to detailed enumeration.
The daily corespondence of stu-
dent government, typing of min-
utes, organization of meetings
and the obligations incurred dur-
ing honor trials admittedly have
taken a large proportion of my
time. But, resulting from these
duties is a knowledge which can
be of great benefit in the office of
President. I offer for your con-
sideration both myself and the
jobs I have done as Secretary and
as an Executive Committee mem-
ber. Through these I hope it can
be understood the responsibility
with which I would perform the
duties of Student Body President.

Thank You,

Mike Luttig

Vice-President:
Mynders Glover

On Monday you will cast your
ballot for the candidates you feel
will best represent your views to
the Executive Committee and
work to achieve the goals which
will serve the Washington and
Lee community. I am a candidate
for Vice-President of the Stu-
dent Body, and I feel that I have
the necessary background and
qualifications to get the job done.

Primarily, the Vice-President is
responsible for devising and ad-
ministering the student budget,
as well as representing the E.C.
on the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee. In my three years at
Washington and Lee, I have serv-
ed as treasurer of my fraternity
where I became familiar with the
budgeting process, worked with
the Contact Committee, and am
presently an officer of the Com-
merce Fraternity. With this back-
ground, I feel I will be able to
meet the demands of the job and
also represent your ideas to the
faculty and E.C,

I will be more than happy to
answer any questions you may

Enforcement of rule
on children in Cockpit
found to be unfair

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi;

Not too long ago there appear-
ed an article in the Ring-tum Phi
concerning town children playing
inside the University Center
building.

The iti is House

It was stated that the children
were not allowed into the game
room or run around in the build-
ing.

I was in the Cockpit on the
29th of January about 8 p.m.
There were some children runn-
ing around and playing in both
the Cockpit and the game room.
These children just happened to
be friends of the cockpit man-
ager Marshall Sumner and his
son.
Is this policy only enforced for
town children with special per-
mission given to staff members?

If so this policy is very unfair.
It should be for all children re-
eardiess of who they are or where
they're from.

A rule should remain a rule.
Once it is made it should be en-
forced at all times.

Sincerely,
Jeanette Smith

moment of your time.
Mynders Glover
Candidate for Student Body
Vice-President

Ted Reeds

In the course of this statement
I wish to explain my intent for
pursuing this office and show
how my previous experience in
student government will help me
carry out the responsibilities of
the Vice-President.

My intent for seeking this of-
fice is that I want to serve the
school, rather than having the
school serve me. Whether it be in
intercollegiate sports or campus
politics, I feel that it is important
for a student to get involved.

The main duties of the Vice-
President are: 1) he is treasurer
of the EC; 2) he is technical ad-
visor to the accused in an Honor
Trial; 3) he is the student repre-
sentative on the Faculty E.C.;
and 4) he represents the EC on
the Publications Board.

To fulfill these duties requires
a certain amount of experience.
One cannot walk into a job like
that and hope to master it over-
night; there are too many re-
sponsibilities involved .

In the last two years I have
gained enough experience to
carry out these responsibilities. I
have served as a representative
on the IFC for the past two years,

and this year I have been a mem-
ber of both the University Coun-
cil and the Mock Convention
Committee.

In summary, I want to serve
this school and feel that I have
plenty of experience to do an
adequate job. Hopefully, you will
agree with me on next Monday.

Thank you,
Ted Reeds

Sandy Stradtman runs
for E.C. Secretary

Gentlemen:

The office of Secretary is a de-
manding job, as I have become
aware while serving on the EC
this year. Briefly, the secretary’s
regular time-consuming duties
are mainly concerned with cor-
respondence and keeping track of
the various campus organizations
and EC committees. I am willing
to accept these, along with the
incidental obligations of the of-
fice.

This year I have encountered
what I consider to be a weakness
of the Honor System, in that a
large percentage of the student
body seems to be unfamiliar with
the basic procedure and ration-
ale surrounding an honor hear-
ing. A better informed student
would tend not only to provide
better constructive criticism, but
also to be more at ease should a

DEAR TRAVELLER—What is Washington and Lee doing to cope
with the continuing energy crisis’
(Signed) ex-Czar Simon

DEAR EX—Hats off to the Student Activities Board on this matter
for the most novel idea. The SAB. in the brunt of cold December
arctic air, took the initiative (and student body funds) to buy flowers
for all the administrative secretaries. The SAB move obviously saved
energy by warming the cockles of the secretaries’ hearts.

The University has been active in other areas in trying to save
energy. For instance, elevators in Reid Hall and Doremus are not
allowed to travel more than 55 miles per hour. And the C-school stu-
dents warm their library with their own naturally-produced methane
gas.
Also, Buildings and Grounds consistently collects garbage from
around the dorms at 7 a.m., eliminating the need for many student
alarm clocks.

A University spokesman told us that W&L will continue to strive
to save energy. Part of the University’s 10-year building improve-
ment plan includes re-wiring the campus heating system to benefit
from the largest source of hot air on campus — the EC and faculty
meeting rooms. That way, the University might finally benefit a
little from each. Of course, since faculty meetings are closed, the air
from that source will first have to be screened through the Univer-
sity’s Public Information Office.

The school is also planning to take after many Texas schools by
drilling oil wells along the Colonnade. “Of course, there's no oil,” says
= University spokesman, “but at least it will show the alumni we're

rying.”
DEAR TRAVELLER—I missed registration for the spring. What
should I sign up for?

 

(Signed ) Al Black
DEAR A.—The army, if you're dumb enough to miss registration.
Anyway, the University is holding open a few courses for late register-
ing, including:

—Journalism 098—Seminar in radio. Students will learn the basic
techniques of tuning in radio on their own receivers. Instruction
ranges from the transistor radio to the tougher task of figuring out
which button to push to give you stereo FM on your stereo system.
WLUR-F™M will provide lollipops to all those who can determine that
91.5 is not on the AM dial. C (M),

—Sociology 344—Communing with nature. Students will be re-
sponsible for hearing the language of trees, rocks, and Norm Lord in
this course. Students meet regularly along turkey trot or in Red
Square. Arranged. Professor E. Gibbons. Prerequisite: Math 256,

Emmer optimistic about defensive Baseball opens season
lineup, foresees battle for goalie

(Ed. note: This is the second
of two articles by Phi Sports Edi-
tor Bill Flesher on the upcoming
Washington and Lee Lacrosse
season. This week Flesher talks
with Generals’ head coach Jack
Emmer about the team’s defense
and the schedule that lies
ahead.)

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

When we left our lacrosse pre-
view last week, we saw one la-
crosse coach who was more than
pleased with his attackmen but
worried as to what might happen
at the midfields, where gradua-
tion left several huge holes to be
filled.

But Jack Emmer remained en-
couraged that through experi-
ence the midfields would come
around in time, though how long
it would take was still a question.

So now we move toward the
W&L goal, and again we see
that graduation has taken a toll,
with two of the four spots vacant.

However Emmer can turn to
experienced players this time,
as four defensemen who saw con-
siderable action last year and the
number two goalie return from
the 1974.

And that’s mentioning nothing
of two of last year’s starters on
defense, which, according to
many experts, turned in one of
the greatest defensive efforts ever
by holding Johns’ Hopkins po-
tent attack to just two goals in
last year’s NCAA semi-final
game.

Junior-tri-captain Rob Lind-
sey, an honorable mention All-
American choice last year, and
sophomore Tom Keigler, who
may have deprived of post-sea-
sons honors due to his freshman
standing in 1974, return to form
what Emmer calls “maybe the

best one-two defensive combina-
tion anywhere.”

“Rob has a knack for rising
to the occasion and stopipng the
best attackmen on the oppos-
ing team, while Tommy may be
the best stick-handling defense-
man I've ever seen,” Emmer said
of his returnees on defense.

The third spot is up for grabs,
with four underclassmen joining
in the fight.

Sophomore John Strock, a
teammate of Keigler at Towson
High School, had the inside
track on the spot during the pre-
season, while junior Dave ‘“‘Weeb”’
Eubank and sophs Steve DiBia-
gio and Steve White were close
behind.

Emmer said that all will see a
lot of action this year if they play
like they have in practice.

So now we arrive at the six
foot square area called the goal,
which for three years has been
manned by one Sterling Chad-
wick, who made it a habit to stop
almost every shot opponents
tried to fire through that square.

But the best goalie in college
lacrosse las year has moved on,
leaving a hole no one had to
worry about until now.

And that, to a certain extent,
includes Emmer.

“We've got some potentially
good people to replace Skeeter,”
Emmer said, with a tone of hope
obviously coming through in his
voice,

A battle for the top spot in the
cage is on between junior Mal-
colm Hastings, Chadwick’s back-
up for the past two years, and
freshman Charlie Brown, a high
school All-American who brings
an excellent reputation to W&L.

As is the case at midfield, the
competition for the goalie spot is
strong, but Emmer sees it as
‘healthy.”

“Malcolm has the experience,
and might have an edge, but
Charlie does some things very
well, and we expect him to work
in there soon,” Emmer said of
his goalies.

So what about the season
ahead, a season that features a
schedule unmatched by any team
in the nation.

The Generals play 10 regular
season games plus three exhibi-
tion games with clubs teams from
Maryland which have several
W&L alumni on their rosters.

“The schedule looks a bit more
awesome than others because we

include our club games on ours,”
Emmer said. “But those club
games (with the Chesapeake, Mt.
Washington, and Maryland
clubs) don’t mean a thing, and
we'll approach them as if they
were intra-squad scrimmages.”

As for the regular season op-
ponents, Emmer capsulized his
outlook on some of the better
foes.

“The consensus around the la-
crosseo wrid is that most of the
teams are stronger this year,”
Emmer said, naming Generals’
opponents North Carolina,
Princeton, Bowling Green, and
Roanoke as some of the prime
examples of rumored improve-
ment.

“Naturally teams like Towson
State, Virginia, Navy, and Rut-
gers will be strong again, Em-
mer said, “but that’s not much
different from past years.”

As for the consensus opinion
on Washington and Lee?

“Well, I've been told that there
is no way that we can be as good
as last year without the people
that we lost,” said Emmer. “But
again, how can people know what
we are without even seeing us
this year.”

And so the stage is set to see
just what will happen without
the stars of yesterday, and to see
just whether or not the consen-
sus on W&L is at all accurate.

with a pair of games

against the U. of Conn.

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team opens its 1975 campaign
this weekend with a pair of
games against the University of
Connecticut.

The season opener at Smith
Field comes on Friday at 3 p.m.,
followed by a 2:00 game Satur-
day afternoon .

W&L head coach Joe Lyles
said that several of the starting
spots are still up in the air, and
probably would not be decided
until gametime on Friday.

“We're enthused over the pro-
spects for the season,” Lyles said,
noting that this year’s team “is
farther ahead of any team I’ve
ever coached.”

Generals ranked in second place
for opening round of tournament

N. C. Methodist and host
Washington and Lee University
have been seeded nos. 1 and 2 for
the NCAA championship basket-
ball tournament here this week-
end.

Methodist, with the best record
of the field at 20-4, will play Wil-
liam Paterson College of New
Jersey (19-5) in the opening
game of the Division III South
Atlantic Regional tourney. W&L
(15-10) will face another New
Jersey school, Glassboro State
(17-9), in the second game.

All games will be held in Dore-
mus Gymnasium, Friday and
Saturday, at 7 and 9 p.m. W&L’s
first round game with Glassboro
will be at 9 p.m. Friday. It is
Washington and Lee’s first ven-

ture into NCAA post-season
play in basketball.

The winner of the tournament
here will be host for the next
round of the championship play,
the quarterfinals, next Tuesday,
March 11. Should W&L win the
tournament on its home court,
the Generals would host the win-
ner of the Middle Atlantic Re-
gional in a single game. Four
Pennsylvania schools are com-
peting in the Middle Atlantic.
They are Scranton (19-7), Wide-
ner (18-7), Franklin & Marshall
(17-7) and Mansfield State (15-
9).

The winner of that contest
would then advance to the final
round of four teams which play
for the national championship

Generals to face West Virginia
in first tennis match on Saturday

A grueling 30-match schedule,
including some of the top teams
in the East and South, faces
Washington and Lee’s_ tennis
team as it opens its 1975 season
Saturday with a home match
against West Virginia.

The match will be played on
the new tennis courts behind Wil-
son Field at 1 p.m.

First-year head coach Dennis
Bussard, though still very involv-
ed with the NCAA-bound bas-
ketball Generals, had things to
say about the upcoming tennis
season.

“It has to be the toughest
schedule any W&L team has ever
had,” Bussard said, pointing out
that some of the opponents in-
clude Florida, South Florida,

Bussard said that he is look-
ing to four returning lettermen
to fill the top spots, while several
freshmen and players from last
year’s junior varsity team are
competing for the remaining
positions.

Senior captain John Embree,
who has won more than 70 per-
cent of his matches in his first
three years, leads the list of re-
turnees along with senior Buz
Walters, junior Don Caffrey, and
sophomore Jim Fisher.

Three freshmen, Ben Johns,
A. O. Smith, and Rex Nyquist
lead the list of newcomers, while
Jim Lawson and Dana LaForge

W&L’'s Hillside Terrace mar-
ried student apartments will be
vacated and torn down this sum-
mer, 29 years after the barracks-
like buildings were constructed
as “temporary” housing for
World War II veterans and their
families.

Eleven of the 18 married stu-
dents now living there graduate
in June, and the University is of-
fering the seven families who re-
main an opportunity to relocate
across town in the university's
other married student housing
area, Davidson Park.

Hillside Terrace was built in
1946 from government surplus
building units and as many as
48 student families lived in the
16 original structures. The re-
duction in the demand for mar-
ried student housing, originally
expected around 1950, did not
occur until 1960 when W&L be-
gan tearing down units as the
need decreased gradually.

The apartments stand on land
leased by the university from the
City of Lexington at a nominal
monthly fee. As W&L units have
been retired, other facilities have
been built on the site, including
offices of the Lexington-Rock-
bridge Health Department and

the area Mental Health Associa-
tion.

Many former tenants of Hill-
side Terrace are among now-pro-
minent alumni of Washington
and Lee, including the Univer-
sity’s President Robert E. R.
Huntley, who lived there two
years while in law school in the
mid-1950s.

The university said the apart-
ments are costing Washington
and Lee more in operations and
repairs than the university “in
good conscience” can charge its
student tenants. Although physi-
cally unattractive and inelegant,
the housing has always been a

popular bargain for student
families because of low rental
charges.

Hillside tenants returning to
school next year will be given
priority choice among vacant
apartments in Davidson Park.
Like Hillside, Davidson Park also
was built in 1946 from govern-
ment surplus, but its units are of
sturdier construction and in good
repair. Rents are modestly higher

Application Deadline 15 April 75.

Hey sophomore: Did you know...

. U That taking the ROTC Two-Year program would bring
you about $3,000 and 8 elective credits between now and
graduation? ($500 plus travel, lodging, and food for each of two six
week camps, and $1,000 per school year.)

That you can beging the Two-Year program with the 6 week
Basic Camp (at Ft. Knox, Ky.—near Louisville ), this summer
and still have until classes start in September to evaluate your
decision prior to assuming any obligation.

That the ROTC program has the flexibility to accommodate
almost any schooling or career desire you might have, be it
graduate schooling (you can delay your entry on active duty
long enough to become, e.g. a doctor, if that is your desire )
or you non-scholarship students can opt for only three to
six months service, principally for schooling, after graduation?

That ROTC scholarships are available to ROTC students
for one, two, and three years and provide full tuition, text-
books, equipment, lab and matriculation fees plus $100 per
month (up to ten months of the school year) for the dura-
tion of the scholarship?

That the major difference between ROTC cadets and other
students is that ROTC cadets take classroom courses (in
civilian clothes) called military science and that they are
paid* $100 per month for their participaton?

(*Paid to students in the advanced course; current sophomores will

be enrolling for the advanced course in the Fall of '75,)

men like you at Ft. Knox this summer,

?, That 2d lieutenants currently start with about three monhs in

Mr. Lewis is prepared to give
vocational counselling and is
qualified to administer vocational
interests tests. He serves as a co-
leader with Ken Lane and Dr.
Worth in the recently initiated,
Friday afternoon human rela-
tions group. In addition, he will
assist Dr. Worth in teaching his
Developmental Psychology class.

He is the first W&L graduate
to come to Lexington for his
field-placement project. If his
work here is successful, as ap-
praised by Dr. Worth, it may be
possible to have other psychology
graduate students coming to
Lexington for their field-place-
ment. Mr. Lewis will be available
through the Spring Term before
receiving his Masters from U. Va.

Procter & Gamble manufactures more than 50 consumer products,
including Crest toothpaste, Duncan Hines cake mixes, Tide detergent,
Pampers disposable diapers, Scope mouthwash and many others
whose names you would recognize just as easily.
For each product, there is a small group, usually just 3 people, who
plan, create, and supervise the total consumer marketing effort —
including TV advertising — for that brand. it's called Brand Manage-

ment, and it is one of the most challenging and personally rewarding
Jobs in our company.

Right now we're looking for a few highly qualified college seniors to
join us at the beginning level in brand management. “Innovative”,
“proven record of leadership and being able to get things done”,
“superior academic achievement”, and “good oral and written com-
munications skilis” are some of the words we use to describe the
people we want.

We want a “take charge” person who can assume immediate respon-
sibility, learn quickly, contribute good ideas, and cope with (and even
enjoy) constantly changing situations. To such a person we offer a
very bright future. We promote only from within, and only on merit,
and you'll move ahead in marketing management as fast as you show
by your work that you're ready for more responsibility.

You may think that things do
not ¢:.nge much around W&L,
but tuat is far from true. The

as the campus was invaded by
the Young Socialist Alliance.

This potent political entity
appeared last Thursday when a
table was set up in front of the

by the YSA which currently

Contact announces

The co-chairmen of Contact
are extremely pleased with the
results of this year’s program
are working to reschedule James
Kilpatrick’s talk, and have an-
nounced a special speaker for
a presentation during the Spring
‘Term.

It is hoped that Kilpatrick will
be able to appear on campus be-
fore the end of this term. He was
not able to present his lecture
this past Monday night because
he contracted the flu, and was
too ill to travel in the snow.

extra lecture

the Spring Break road trip, and
future prospects for the team.

For those who schedule their
social events weeks in advance,
Emmer will present his talk on
April 16, the first Wednesday
after Spring break.

In discussing the main portion
of Contact, Ben Sherman noted
that he was pleased with the
overall attendance, taking into
receount the somewhat limited
appeal of this year's program.
This year Contact dealt with
problems in the American legal,
political, economic and industrial
systems, with Kilpatrick's lecture
to be on the mass media. Some
of those who delivered addresses

this year were relatively un-
known to the average student,
and the program itself con-
flicted with mid-term tests in
some instances.

This year's program, on a
higher intellectual plane than

some previous Contacts, received
high praise from President Hunt-
ley. He has said that this Contact
was by far the best he has seen
since he became head of the uni-
versity in 1968,

The participants themselves
thoroughly enjoyed their visits to
WA&L. T. Justin Moore, president
of VEPCo, has written to the
Contact committee that VEPCo
was extremely pleased with the
between Moore and en-
vironmental activist David
Brower, and that it just might
encouraging more of its

debate

McCullough, Glover

win in EC elections

3y JOK FITZGERALD
Leland McCullough, Mynders
Glover and Sandy Stradtman
have won elections to the posts
of President, Vice-President and

Secretary, respectively, of the
student body.
McCullough defeated Mike

Luttig by a margin of 508 to
356 with 28 write-ins. Glover re-
ceived 477 votes to defeat Ted
Reeds, who had 325. There were
20 write-ins. Stradtman, who
was unopposed for Secretary, got
621 votes. There were 47 write-in
votes in that race.

The candidates had little com-
ment on the outcome of the
elections. Leland McCullough
said only, “It’s good to have all
that stuff over with.” Ted Reeds,
referring to his loss, said, “I
guess I know how it feels now.”
Mynders Glover, when asked if
he wanted to make any comment,
replied, “Not particularly.”

Also in regard to elections, the
Executive Committee announced
Monday night that petitions for
class officers and class E.C.
representatives are due in the
E.C. room by 7 p.m. Monday
night.

Petitions must be signed by 50
students. Each class will elect
a president and two E.C. repre-
sentatives. The rising sophomore
and junior classes will elect one
vice-president. The rising seniors
will elect three vice-presidents,
one each from arts, science and
commerce.

Later Monday evening, after
tallying election votes, the Ex-
ecutive Committee took its own
final vote on all Honor System
changes made in the last month.
The E.C. also voted, 11-1 with
Mike Luttig opposed, that the
changes will go into effect at
midnight on March 23.

Luttig was opposed to the sud-
den implementation of the
changes on the grounds that it
does not leave time enough to
orient the students. Elliot Hicks
and Steve Robinson proposed
that the changes take effect im-
mediately.

The E.C. also took a first vote
on erammatical corrections made
in the White Book by Everett
Martin and Bob Pugh. The final
vote on those changes will come
next week,

In other business, the E.C.
heard from Jerry Darrell dining
ing hall manager, and Paul Malin,
hall manager, and Paul Malin
Pat Brennan, and Jim Haines,
student checkers in the dining

without paying and get food for
other persons in the dining hall.

The dining hall delegation re-
ported on students not paying
for meals, using someone else's
contract card, getting food and
drinks for dates and generally
making life tough for the check-
ers.

According to Malin, “Students
are no longer supporting the
Honor System in the dining hall.”

The E.C. decided to send two
or three of its members to watch
the lines during meals so they
may become more familiar with
the problems in hopes of doing
something about them.

The E.C. will also be passing
out a questionnaire telling stu-
dents the alternatives for con-
trol of the dining hall and ask-
ing them which they prefer.

The E.C. heard a report from
Lawrence Lyles of the Curricu-
lum Committee. Lyles reported
that the class survey conducted
during the Fall term is now
completed and should be avail-
able soon. He said only a hand-
ful of professors did not use the
forms last term, and he predict-
ed an easy job for next year’s
Curriculum Committee chairman.

Lyles also reported that the
class survey for the Winter term
will be conducted next week.

Mock Convention seeks

4 regional coordinators

By The Phi News Staff

The 1976 Mock Convention
Steering Committee is now tak-
ing applications for the positions
of Eastern, Southern, Western
and Mid-Western regional co-
ordinators. These four people,
along with the credentials chair-
man, will comprise the Credent-
ials Committee for the 1976
Mock Convention. This com-
mittee monitors the progress of
state delegations in research,
fund-raising, and other duties,
and assists each delegation in
every way possible. More specific-
ally, each coordinator is required
to develop a knowledge of his
region’s political scene, while an
administrative assistant (again,
one for each region) handles the
bulk of the work.

As only 45% of the real con-
vention delegates are chosen be-
fore the W&L convention, the job
of the regional coordinator, that
of insuring the validity of delega-
tion votes on the first and subse-
quent ballots, becomes one of the
most crucial during the conven-
tion.

Applications are available in
the University Center (in Ken
Lane's office) and in the Book-
store. They are due in Ken
Lane's office by 3 p.m. on Mon-
day. March 17. Interviews will
be held early the next week, and
applicants will be notified by
mail. For further information,
please contact Reed Morgan, Ken
Ruscio, or Tom Rittenburg.

THE RING-TUM PHI

« .
Fans

Many peope have been complaining lately about the
conduct of W&L students at lacrosse games. Up until this
point we have dismissed most of these accusations as we felt

that the enthusiasm of the students was more important than a
few blown-out fans. We concluded that those who complained
were simply too sensitive and temperamental to accept the
rambunctious behavior of some students out for a good time.

Several situations brought to our attention lately have
forced us to change our opinion on this matter. A few weeks
ago we were told that two of the teams on our lacrosse
schedule had seriously considered dropping W&L from their
program owing to the problem they had had with the W&L
fans. Whether it is throwing ice, riping out seats, or explicit

language which concerns our opponents, we were almost

dropped from the programs of schools which we want and

need to play, eg., U.Va.

Recently the problem of W&L fans and their conduct
has been brought to our attention as the result of what for
us is an unfortunate situation. Even as we type this editorial,
U.Va. has offered W&L the use of their stadium to play this
week's games which might have to be cancelled if the only
alternative was playing them in the slush and mud of the
W&L fields. However, U.Va. placed one condition on their

offer: that the student body

here not be widely informed

that its team would be in Charlottesvile, This condition was
intended to keep the number of W&L fans to a minimum in

the Charottesville facilities.

As much as we hate to say it, our fans do need to cool
the act a little. We have now made ourselves unwelcome as
fans at some neighboring schools, In the process of swilling
and partying, we may be hurting our lacrosse team more than
we are helping it. We say this with caution as we do not
wish to give the impression that we fail to appreciate the

enthusiasm of the

Wé&L students, and we

know that the

athletic department would concur with us on this point. Cer-
tainly, being obnoxious does have its place at any athletic
event, On the other hand, there is such a thing as going
overboard. Please restrain yourselves from the temptation to
throw a side body-block on the wife of the President of the
University at the next lacrosse game.

Concern expressed
for inequality of rules

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi;

I am a freshman who is seri-
ously concerned with the inequ-
ality of rules stressed by this
University. Five others and I are
presently kicked out of our dorm
rooms for smoking pot. We went
in front of the Student Control
Committee for this offense. I
am not trying to justify this act,
but I believe that it's University
Policy to punish all offenders of
the law.

Therefore I believe it is only
right to punish those people who
come back from parties on the
week-ends drunk and disorderly,
making undue noise and trashing
the quad so that the janitors on
Saturday must clean up after
these morons. I can go up to my
room, smoke a joint, and I bother
no one. Yet when these children
‘and I mean children) come back
roaring drunk, they not only
bother me, but many others on
this campus. Marijuana is a
misdeanor in this state, but so
is drunk and disorderly.

Thus I believe if you punish
one violation of the law, I think
it's the University's responsibility
to punish all breaches of conduct.
I am not condoning the use of
pot, nor am I condemning the
use of alcohol, but it is only just
that if you pressure one group
with punishment you must pres-
sure all with the same.

For this University’s basis is
to make gentlemen of us all and
by avoiding these actions, it fails
to do 80.

Name withheld upon request

We can understand your con-
cern jor the apparent discrep-
aneyv, but there is a significant
reason for the different handl-
ing of these cases, Possession o/
marijuana, a misdemeanor, car-
ries with it a maximum of twelve
months imprisonment and one
thousand dollar fine, Being drunk
and disorderly in public is pun-
ishable by a maximum penalty
of ten dollars. Hardly comparable
although both are misdemeanors.

White Column Inn offers something new

By JAMES MASON
Phi Food Lditor

Deciding where to have dinner
or lunch in Lexington often pre-
sents the student with something
of a problem. He finds a large
number of establishments avail-
able to visit; Lexington does have
quantity in respect to the num-
ber of restaurants. On closer
inspection he realizes that there
is not a great deal of variety
among the many eating places.
Half the restaurants in town
specialize in Italian food and
pizza. However, one cannot live
on pasta and pepperoni alone.
The traditional Lexington altern-
ative is a greasy soy-burger and
frozen french fries—not the most
desirable of dinners.

Owing to these circumstances
on the Lexington culinary scene,
it was with considerable expecta-
tion that we awaited the open-
ing of the White Column Inn
under the managment of Mrs.
Odell McGuire. Having now
visited this new establishment
some fifteen times we can hon-
estly say that we are genuinely
pleased.

The White Column Inn offers
something old and something
new. At last Lexington has a
restaurant whose cook/owner
shows a knowledge of how food
should be handled. Mrs. Mc-
Guire treats the elements of her
cooking reverently and simply—
a concept new to Lexington, or
long forgotten, but old else-
where. She allows the many dif-
ferent types of food she serves to
retain their natural flavors; her
preparation employs seasonings
to enhance, rather than mask,
the inherent qualities of ingre-
dients.

As indicated above, the crucial
consideration in evaluating a
restaurant is the food. However,
atmosphere and service are also
important in the complete ap-
praisal. In reviewing the first
of these three elements one must
take a look at the luncheon and
dinner offerings separately and
make a few suggestions for the
aspiring gourmand.

Between noon and two p.m.,,
Tuesday through Friday, Mrs.
McGuire's bill of fare includes 2
soups, salads, and assorted sand-
wiches. The soups are consistent-
ly hearty and fresh, although
some are better than others. The
cream soups, bisques, and thick
vegetable soups with purees are
among the best offered. Especi-
ally good are the chicken gumbo,
potato and leek, cream of mush-
room, and ham and lentil. These
are very thick and rich, sub-
stantial enough to make a de-

the ham, cheese, and pineapple
is a pleasing combination sand-
wich. The salads are always crisp
and fresh and do not feature
standard Lexington wilted
greens. For a dollar or two one
can enjoy a satisfying lunch any
day.

The White Column Inn dinners,
ranging in price from $2.50 to
$4.50, are probably the best bar-
gains in Lexington. They in-
clude two specialties each eve-
ning, Wednesday through Satur-
day. The entrees of chicken are

more modest offered is Welsh
rarebit or a vegetable plate with
broccoli in Hollandaise. Every
dinner comes with onion soup
to start things off nicely and
fresh rolls a la McGuire.

Menus change on the week-
end but remain equally enjoy-
able. With Saturday lunch comes
home-made chili, which avoids
an over-abundance of either
grease or ketchup and is so much
the better for it. Brunch on Sun-
day provides either crepes or
omelettes (again, something new

lightful meal in themselves at

Letters to the Editor...

Society, and probably the City
of Lexington, looks upon stu-
dents’ drinking in quite a dif-
ferent light than their use of
“obnoxious weeds.” The school is
only protecting itself and its
students by enforcing what you
may feel are somewhat strict
rules on the use of marijuana.

If the school failed to enforce
restrictions on drugs, the town
probably would, and that would
not be at all desirable for some-
one like you. Drinking by minors
or being drunk and disorderly is
something that the city authori-
ties graciously overlook unless it
is brought right under their
noses. Thus, the rules are there
only to protect you in the case
of marijuana, They do not exist
for cases concerning drinking be-
cause the same problems do not
exist here.

Freshman response

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Your critcism of the Fresh-
man grain party was an unjust
slap in the class's face. As a
matter of fact the Freshman
grain party was one of the suc-
cesses of Fancy Dress weekend:
good weather, adequate parking,
and plenty of open space to move
around in, I also was at the
party for two and a half hours
and had my cup filled every
time I went to the “trough.”

Perhaps you could have had
the initiative to hustle a few
cups of grain. At least you could
have made an effort to show up
at the party earlier, instead of
waiting to complain in your
editorial.

You did too much “back slap-
ping” in the other areas to then
turn and criticise the Freshman
party. There were other efforts
that were deficient. For example,
it was hellishly hot in the Star-
light Club Friday night. As we
all know, organization and plan-
ning take care of such matters.
The organization of the Fresh-
man party could not have been
better.

Sincerely,
Asa G. Candler, VI

Freshmen defend their

recent grain party

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

In accordance with your edi-
torial of February 27, we would
also like to compliment the stu-
dent body for their fine re-
sponse to Fancy Dress this year.
But the criticism in your state-
ment offered to the Freshmen
class officers was neither con-
structive nor concretely founded.
We regard your assertion that
“the organizers did about as
much wrong as they possibly
could have" as totally inaccurate
We daresay that the majority of
those who attended would also
disagree with it.

Your point that there was not
enough grain was entirely true,
if you consider “enough” as the
amount necessary to cause all
the party-goers to become hope-
lessly intoxicated. It would
doubtlessly take more money
than is in the coffers of every
class treasury combined to ac-
complish such a goal. The
amount of grain (35 gallons)
bought for the Fancy Dress party
was five gallons more than that
bought for the grain party spon-
sored by the Sophomore class in
the spring.

The only point after which
grain punch became “impossible
to get’ was the end of the party.
The temporary shortage of the
water needed to mix the punch
was due to the failure of the
Pavilion’s owner to return with
additional water within a
promised time period of thirty
minutes. Instead he returned in
forty-five minutes, making it im-
possible for grain to be served
for a minimal fifteen minutes,
Punch flowed freely for the re-

maining time; never did the
organizers ‘simply decide to stop
serving” or run out of grain
alcohol. Ask those who watched
us mix the punch about its being
“weak.” You'll find their answers
contrary to your allegation to
that effect.

It is easier for most of us to
condemn rather than to com-
mend; however, the comments
directed toward us by others
about the grain party were in
praise of its success, not out of
criticism of its alleged failure.
In spite of this “weak link” in
your editorial, it was “quite a
success,’ and for that, ‘we have
only (you) to thank.”

Faculty logic questioned

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I would like to express my
extreme disappointment with the
faculty's decision not to change
the current Winter Term exam
schedule. This means that exams
will commence Monday, March
31, and end Saturday, April 5.

The decision to alter the school
calendar rests solely with the
faculty, Before their vote on the
issue last week, they had received
two recommendations to switch
the starting date to Saturday.
March 29. The first originated
with the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee, and while the second
came from the University Coun-
cil, I initiated the switch in the
U.C. for two principle reasons

The Alexander-Withrow House

3% WEST WASHINGTON STREET
A restored historic landmark with five period-furnished guest suites.
A different experience in overnight hospitality for those who love
fine things. Students may make reservations for their parents and
tour the house from 10-2 Tuesday through Saturday or write Mrs.

Harriet Thomas.

One—students under the present
exam schedule taking four exams
would not have the option of a
day between each exam. Two—
those students wishing to finish
quickly would be able to leave
earlier.

Why the majority of the
faculty elected to maintain the
present schedule is most puzzling
to me. A reliable source indicat-
ed to me that one of the main
reasons the faculty decided
against any change was the
faculty's belief that they could
not have the exams ready by
Saturday. This I find difficult
to believe. Besides the fact that
they would have had a month's
notice so as to adjust, the faculty,
earlier in the year, approved a
tentative calendar which stipu-
lates that for the next fifteen
terms (five years) exams will
begin on that first Saturday after
classes end. What then, makes
this term any different from the
next fifteen?

Apparently another argument

for Lexington). The White
Column Inn is not open Monday
or for dinner on Sunday or
Tuesday.

Besides good food, the White
Column Inn provides a pleasant
atmosphere and acceptable ser-
vice. The building which form-
erly housed the Appalachian
Pickin’ Parlor is still rustic al-
though much more comfortable

(Continued on page 4)

given at the facully meeting was
that it would be too confusing
to change the schedule. My reply
to that, baloney. A couple of
posters ought to alleviate any
potential confusion.

The faculty's logic is most baf-
fling. Exams have begun on
Saturday in the past and are
scheduled to do so in the future.
Unfortunately, one thing is clear:
this sudden deviation will bring
a good deal of inconvenience to
the student body.

David Davis ‘77

That a_ faculty decision
appears illogical and even con-
tradictory is not the most sur-
prising thing we have heard
lately. Any group which allows
Friday to become Thursday
and Saturday to replace Friday
may just as easily decree that
it cannot change its schedule
by one day on such short
notice, i.e., one month in ad-
vance,

of your positive support.

A letter to the fans

We, the captains of the 1975 W&L lacrosse team, would like
to express some of our feelings concerning student support at

We are extremely proud that the student body has en-
thusiastically supported our team these last few years. Without
you behind us we're very sure our success would have been
limited. We feel lacrosse at W&L has been a unifying force for
the entire university community and has been a source of pride
for students, faculty and alumni alike. The excitement that has
been created in 1973 and 1974 has affected our school in many
ive ways, but there have been times when your abundant
sort has created some negative reactions from within our
school and from parents, friends, prospects, and visitors.
i.ot us explain ourselves: we depend on your positive sup-

Lo be successful. We have some fond memories of situations
our Towson game a year ago when we were down by
three goals late in the game and everyone in the stands gave
us a standing and long lasting cheer. It felt great and we
subsequently made a super comeback to win in overtime. There
is no doubt in that situation that your support was of @

There are times, however, when the feedback we receive on
your actions is a negative one. We don’t think that our fans
have to stoop so low as to embarrass our opponents with
offensive language or actions. Parents, guests and prospects,
who we hope will help W&L continue its winning ways, have
at times been insulted and generally taken back by particular
fan behavior. We assume you all realize what we are referring
to and realize that some of these negative actions only tarnish
all the positive things lacrosse and student lacrosse fans have
accomplished over the last few years.

Our appeal to you, the student body, is to continue to give
us the outstanding support you've recently shown, but to keep
it in a positive form. We hope, if a small minority gets out of
hand at Wilson Field, that others will take a stand and remedy

We look forward to another great year and the excitement

Wrestling, baseball teams
have little weekend success

Washington and Lee’s baseball
and wrestling teams had little
success over the weekend.

The baseball Generals dropped
a season opening doubleheader to
Connecticut, 4-0 and 16-0, while
only one wrestler won any
matches at the NCAA-Division
Ill championships in Cleveland.

W&L could muster only three
hits in the doubleheader, while
the visitors, playing outside for
the first time this year, came
through with three home runs
and a total of 22 hits in the
doubleheader.

Senior Rod Ferrandino pitch-
ed well in his first outing, allow-
ing just five hits in the opener.
One of those, however, was a
roundtripper to Connecticut's
Mike D’Arminio.

Sophomore Dan Westbrook had

the roof fall in on him in the
nightcap, as Connecticut explod-
ed for 11 runs in the third inning.

Only senior co-captain Doug
Ford had any success at the
NCAA wrestling meet.

Ford, wrestling at 177 pounds,
won his first match by a pin
before being eliminated to the
consolation bracket by an event-
ual semi-finalist.

In the consolation bracket
Ford won two matches and came
within a match of All-American
standing before suffering an
overtime loss to a wrestler from
Luther (lowa) College, 3-0.

Three W&L wrestlers, Howard
Knipp (118), Jim Crytzer (150),
and Steve Schweizerhaf (Hvy)
all lost first round matches.

Stickmen upset in opener, 8-7

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

It had been a long time in
coming, maybe.

But for Washington and Lee
lacrosse fans, many of whom
were seeing the Generals in
action for the first time, it was
more than just a disappoint-
ment.

It was a near disaster,

What happened was that the
Generals lost a lacrosse game.
Not that such a phenomenon had
not occured before—W&L had
fallen twice in NCAA tournament
play and several times in exhibi-
tion games to club teams in 1973
and 1974.

But not once in the past two
years had the Generals lost a
regular season game.

It finally happened Saturday.

Morgan State, the same school
that was win number one for
W&L in 1973 and 1974, rose to
the occasion and played their best
game ever to beat the Generals,
8-7, in the season opener for
both teams.

The higher-than-a-kite Bears

Netters post
8-1 win in
first match

Washington and Lee’s tennis
team opened its season on a win-
ning note Saturday, downing
West Virginia, 8-1.

W&L won the match in the
Singles, as John Embree, Jim
Fisher, Buz Walters, A. O. Smith,
and Don Caffrey won their
matches.

The Generals padded their
margin when Embree teamed
with Ben Johns, Smith with
Fisher, and Walters with Caffrey
to win all three doubles matches.

W&L had its Monday match
with Haverford postponed due to
snow.

The schedule for this week:

Saturday—Dartmouth—home
at 1:00; Sunday—Dartmouth—
home at 1:00; Wednesday at
Richmond.

won the game by simply outplay-
ing W&L, something few teams
have done in recent years.

The key to Morgan State’s win
was sophomore goalie Courtenay
Servary, who put on a show by
himself, making 25 saves, several
of the unbelievable variety.

Servary’s work in the _ net
sparked Morgan State’s second
half comeback. The Bears trailed
5-2 at halftime, and with the
weather being cold and windy
as it was, many of the Wilson
Field crowd of nearly 2,000 head-
ed for warmer quarters.

But Morgan State persevered
scoring the first two goals of
the second half to cut the W&L
lead to 5-4.

W&L’s Don Carroll, who led

all scorers with four goals, then
put the Generals up by two with
his third tally of the game.

However it was the Generals’
last goal for nearly 25 minutes,
a stretch of time in which
Morgan State made their move
toward the win.

The Bears’ John Workman
scored twice near the end of the
period to knot the score at 6-6
after three quarters. Then Dave
Raymond, along with Servary an
Honorable Mention All-American
last year, got his second goal to
put the Bears ahead, 7-6.

The clincher came on a heads-
up play by Morgan State’s Mike
Walsh,

ings moved upfield for a clear-

solation game the following night

ing attempt, Walsh moved in for
a check. Suddenly the ball pop-
ped out of Hastings’ stick, Walsh
picked it up, and tossed it into
an empty net to seal the Gen-
erals’ fate.

Carroll broke W&L’s scoring
drought with 2:44 left to cut
the lead to 8-7, but several shots
late in the game were all turned
away by Servary, who seemed to
have the clutch play whenever
he needed it.

Attackman Rob Morgan joined
Carroll in leading the W&L scor-
ing with two goals and two
assists, while midfielder Ken
Miller scored the final General’s
goal.

Noticably missing from the
General’s attack was 1974 lead-
ing scorer Dave Warfield, who
watched the game from the side-
line as a result of a knee in-
jury suffered in practice.

The knee was placed in a cast
as a precautionary measure.
However no one is sure just
when Warfield might return to
action.

W&L trailed North Carolina

But the Generals rallied behind
Kristoff and John Podgajny to
take a 39-36 lead with 14:00 left.

Then the Monarchs put to-
gether a 15-3 spurt that gave
them the lead which they never

Podgajny led W&L with 17

Elton Stanley had 30 points, 11

‘Changing Room’ to open Monday

accents to the action
itself. naturalism is the domi-
nant characteristic in ‘The
Chang.ng Room” by David
Storey, the play that opens
Monday, March 24, at the Uni-
versity Theatre.

The play—the enactment of
an afternoon with a British
rugby team, not on the field
but before and after its game,
as well as during halftime—
offers perhaps the most diffi-
cult challenge to the performers
of any play in recent years, ac-
cording to Lee Kahn, Univer-
sity Theatre director. “It is
completely an actor's script.”

Because on-stage physical ac-
tivity is at a minimum, the
“action” of the play is almost
wholly in the verbal exchange
between the men—two dozen of
whom are on stage throughout
the entire play, Kahn notes.

Kahn had to keep that in mind
even in casting the play. He
selected the actors as a single

Frem

Phi Beta Kappa to add
26 members this year
at Tuesday ceremony

Claude 8S. George Jr., associate
dean of the Graduate School of
Business Administration at the
University of North Carolina
(Chapel Hill), will be the speaker
next Tuesday, March 25, at the
annual Phi Bet Kappa convoca-
tion,

George will speak at 12:30 p.m.
in Lee Chapel. He has given his
address the title “The Unexamin-
ed Life,” taken from Plato's
statement, “The unexamined is
not worth living.”

Because of the speech, classes
will be shortened next Tuesday.

A total of 26 newly elected Phi
Beta Kappa members will be in-
ducted in the 199-year-old so-
ciety at a banquet Tuesday eve-
ning. The initiates include 18
undergraduate seniors, seven
juniors, one 1974 graduate and
two faculty members at the uni-
versity.

George is a native of Danville
who has taught at Chapel Hill
since 1954. He holds the Ph.D.
from Iowa State, and taught
previously at lowa and Texas.

He is the author of “Manage-
ment Thought,” and has con-
tributed many articles to profes-
soinal journals in his field. He
is a fellow of the American
Academy of Management and is
a member of numerous other pro-
fessional and scholarly societies.

unit—a company—rather than
designating individual roles for
individual actors. Only after they
had worked with the play in a
general, improvisational way for
about two weeks were specific
roles assigned to actors, Kahn
says—and by then, each actor,
for the most part, had gravitated
toward a particular part on his
own.

To add to the actors’ feeling
for the characters, cast members
even played rugby, familiarizing
themselves with the “environ-
ment,’ mental as well as physical,
in which a rugby team lives.

Because the play is set in
Yorkshire, the requirements of
total naturalism dictated that
the actors speak with authentic
accents, In order to alleviate this
problem, a voice coach who
specializes in accents, Deborah
Ross, has spent two weekends
with the cast training the actors
in the peculiarities of the York-
shire speech pattern. Ross is a
faculty member at the American
Academy of Dramatic Arts in
New York, of which Kahn is the

newly named executive vice
president,

With no single ‘leading’ role,
Kahn's actors have developed

their own physical movements,
exactly as they would if they
were actual team members.

The principal challenge to the
cast, he points out, is the need
for “acute listening.” The play is
essentially an exchange among
24 men of locker-room type “one

liners,” with each man respond-
ing to each other man’s com-
ments, jokes, questions and the
like.

The unusual difficulty in act-
ing in “The Changing Room,”
the result of its psychological
rather than physical nature, is
typical of the playwright, Kahn
says. Storey himself played on a
rugby team in Yorkshire, and the
play is largely autobiographical.

Reflecting Storey’s own exeri-
ence, most of the rugby players
in “The Changing Room” play
the game for one or another of
just two reasons—for the glory
it brings once a week to an other-
wise deadly monotonous life, or
simply for the money—about $40
-——they receive for each game,
often the difference between pov-
erty and a few luxuries.

Team members in Yorkshire
and in the play alike resent the
occasional man who tries to
break out of that existence. Kahn
says the careful observer will
recognize the character in “The
Changing Room’ who, like
Storey, fits that role too.

The play was first produced
in America three years ago to
critical acclaim on Broadway
after a major success in London.
The University Theatre’s pro-
duction—which runs through
Saturday—is one of the first in
America by a college theatre.

Curtain time is 8 pm, each
evening, and advance reserva-
tions should be made by calling

Co-op tries

By the Phi News Staff

The cashier's counter has been
moved in the Co-op, to help ex-
pedite service and eliminate a
possible health hazard,

James Toler, manager of the
University Supply Store, reports
that some time ago he received
a complaint from someone on
campus who noticed that the
same attendants who prepared
food were handling the cash
register and making change.
While they try to wash their
hands before handing food, it
is virtually impossible to do so
every time, particularly during
the peak “counter crunches” be-
tween class periods.

The person who made the com-
plaint suggested that Toler
look into the possibility of pro-
viding a separate § cashier's
counter, and so segregate food-
hadling from money handling.

Checking with the local Health
Department, Toler found that
allhough the old system was not
in direct violation of any regula-
tion, it would be preferable if
the cash register were moved

With the new system, the
workers behind the snack counter
trade off on the cashier's
job, providing a break from con-
stantly preparing students’
orders. More counter space is
now available for use in food
preparation, And finally, people
who only make a small purchase,
such as a bag of potato chips,
can pay for it more quickly than
inder the previous method, when

The grain platform

When considering the imposing list of candidates for class
offices one should keep in mind the particularly important
function of the presidents of each class. These men will be
entrusted with the class dues they collect after their election
and will be expected to organize the grain parties for their
classes. One must be aware of the fact that the grain cocktail
party is perhaps the most important historical event since the
death of Garland, the birth of the blues, and the freezing of
spinach.

Gary Seldomridge, Kim Ratliff, and Scott Stevenson are
the candidates for Senior President of the 1975-76 academic
year. Each of these gentlemen probably could make a more
than adequate showing in arranging a cocktail party. We know
for a fact that Mr. Seldomridge, President of this year’s
junior class, began making plans for the spring grain gala
after the questionable freshman showing on Fancy Dress
weekend. It is impossible to evaluate his performance at
this point, but we are sure that he will execute his duties
satisfactorily. We must, in all fairness, state that Mr. Ratliff
would also show a worldly knowledge of mixing grain if he
is given that opportunity by his peers.

For the office of Junior President Bill Craver faces Tom
Hunter next Monday. The first is a Pi Kappa Alpha while
the latter is a Phi Kappa Sigma. This choice presents us with
something of a dilemma as both should be able to handle
their appointment with the required expertise. We know that
Mr. Craver treats grain alcohol with the reverence second to
none and would quarantee a superior punch complemented
by fine examples of gatoring.

The freshman class candidates for the head of their class
include Rodney Cook (again), Mike Cleary, and George
Triplett. Mr. Cook could probably discharge his duties but
perhaps with a bit more finesse than was the case this year.
He seems extremely defensive about his grain party and shows
a somewhat unfortunate attitude toward the affair. Mr. Cook:
anything can be improved upon—even the grain party which
you and your cronies thought perfect. If you realize that a
good thing can be made better in amost all cases, then
perhaps such open-mindedness will result in a better grain
party next year by the sophomore class. In any event, we
wish the rising sophomore class luck; any of the gentlemen
running for this office would be satisfactory to some degree.

Honor System changes explained

At our request, the President-
elect of the Student Body Leland
McCullough submitted this art-
icle on the changes in the Honor
System which the Executive
Committee has approved. These
changes listed here go into effect
on March 24 at 12:01 a.m.

Over the past several months
the EC has undertaken an ex-
tensive examination of the Honor
System, We have attempted to
gauge the public sentiment in
many ways, including student
questionnaires, Lee Chapel ‘town
meetings,” faculty interviews,
and heavily publicized open EC
hearings. This input has moved
us to make the following
changes:

The first change involves the
duty of a student when he sus-
pects a violation, Under the pres-
ent system, he must immediately
turn any suspected violation over
to the EC. We believe that it
is important to give students who
are unsure about whether a viola-
tion has occurred the option of
confonting the suspected student
and asking for an explanation of
the incident. If the suspected
student provides a satisfactory
explanation and is able to show
that there was a misunderstand-
ing, then the matter may be
dropped. If the explanation is
unsatisfactory and further in-
vestigation is necessary, then the
student must bring the violation
to the Executive Committee.
Hopefully, this will prevent minor
misunderstandings from being
blown up into major honor trials.

One change was made in the
private hearing. The accused will
be able to request an extended
recess after six hours. This will
make sure that the accused and
the EC will be attentive to all
evidence and will not be exhaust-
ed and lose concentration during
a drawn-out trial.

Perhaps the most important
change in the public hearing is
the introduction of an advocate
for the EC. Many students have
felt that the public hearing has
been weighted in favor of the
accused. We believe that an EC
advocate would add much-need-
ed balance and direction. Under
the new public trial process, both
the EC and the accused will have
up to two advocates. The EC
presents its side first, and then
the accused presents his defense.
Both sides may cross-examine
witnesses. The jury retains the
right to call witnesses and ask
questions, They do this after both
sides have finished. After all
evidence has been presented, the
EC advocates and the accused
deliver a final statement.

Some have argued that these
changes may tilt the scales of
justice against the accused, How-
ever, we have taken several steps
to ensure a fair and equitable
trial; 1) the EC will no longer
deliver the summary of reasons
why the accused was found guilty.

W&L Swing rises

The continuing saga of Wood’s Creek; .
excuses are flowing, but the cement isn’t

BY STEVE YEVICH
Phi Feature Editor

The observant student crossing
the footbridge over Wood's Creek
may think to himself that W&L’'s
new apartment complex seems
mighty far from completion,
particularly if that same student
is planning to occupy one of the
apartments next autumn,

Unfortunately, at least one of
the three units is considerably
far from being finished.

Job conferences, at which the
work in progress is discussed, are
held every two weeks on the
Wood's Creek project. At the
most recent of these meetings, a
representative of the architectur-
al firm of Marcellus Wright, Cox,
Cilimberg and Ladd reported that
the West unit, the building near-
est the footbridge, is only 35%
complete. The central structure
was half finished, while the East
unit was reported as 60% com-
plete.

Kane Construction Company,
the contracting firm, maintains
that it will have all three build-
ings completed by its revised May
1 deadline. However, W&L ad-
ministrators most closely con-
nected with the project believe
that it is realistic to assume that
only two buildings, at best, will
be nearing completion in May,
but hope that the third will be
ready by September.

Frank Parsons, assistant to
President Huntley, feels that the
East and Central units will be
finished by May 1, weather per-
mitting, after which time the
contractor would presumably re-
assign all crews to the remaining
building to facilitate the swift
completion of the whole project.

“We realistically think that the
apartments will be completed
sometime this summer,” Parsons
said in an interview. “The Uni-
versity is extremely eager to get
the job done and get our stu-
dents settled in these buildings.”

William Mohler, Director of
University Services, is not quite
80 optimistic. “To be frank, my
feeling is that it is conveivable
that the East and Central build-
ings will bear habitation by the
fall. The West building—I have
grave doubts about it. It's drag-
ging considerably.” That unit
will eventually accomodate 76
students, out of a total of 178
in the whole project.

Agreeing with Mohler is Lewis
John, Dean of Students, who also
has reservations about the West
unit. Having the contractor's
word and the reports of the
architects, however, John and
Mohler are proceeding to offer
for rental all of the apartments,
under essentially the same pro-
visions as last year. Those provi-
sions include a refundable de-
posit of $100, and a non-binding
lease that may be broken by
the maker at any time prior to
the completion of the units.
Rental rates remain unchanged
from last year's figures.

Several months ago the project

The Alexander-

was reported as keeping to the
revised construction schedule.
What happened this time? ,

For one thing, there have been
significant delays in the pouring
of concrete at the West building
site, owing to the presence of
some overhead wires at a critical
spot. The Virginia Electric and
Power Company has been slow
to relocate these lines in an
underground cable, and because
of the danger of fouling the lines
construction on that site has
been hampered.

Also to blame for recent de-
lays are the effects of internal
personnel changes in the Kane
corporation. Supervisors have
been reassigned, and the top
management levels at the branch
office handling the project have
been drastically reshuffled.

A further complication result-
ed indirectly from increased fed-
eral government regulation of
cement plants. Stringent EPA
requirements forced the shut-
down of a considerable number
of marginal cement plants, and
so caused a shortage of ready-
mixed cement for a period of
time. With the recent stagnation
of the building industry in gen-
eral, though, there have been
few problems in obtaining the
quantities of cement required by
the construction.

Normally, weather is taken into
account in a contractor's calcula-
tions as to the length of time
needed for the completion of a
given project. The occurrence of
too many rainy days will prompt
him into claiming adverse
weather conditions as a factor
in hindering rapid construction.
While Kane has not yet done
so, the occasion of a few more
wet days, such as in the past
weeks, will probably encourage
him to place blames on the rain.

Last year the weather was
claimed to have been the chief
culprit in delaying construction,
which was begun in October of
1973, The apartments, which

Many felt this procedure auto-
matically biased the jury, 2) the
EC advocates may not refer to
deliberations in the private hear-
ing, 3) advisors for the accused
may call witnesses and ask ques-
tions. Under the old system, they
could not speak in his behalf.
4) the jury will no longer be
able to see the transcript from
the private hearing. This was
done because the EC is of the
opinion that the purpose of the
public hearing is to give the
accused an entirely new trial.
Unfortunately, use of the tran-
script in the past has made the
public trial only an appeal of
the EC hearing, and has focused
the attention of the jury on
evidence from the original trial.
Elimination of the transcript
frees the jury to examine the
witnesses and sift through the
evidence as it is brought out by
the two sides, without being in-
fluenced by evidence from the
witnesses and sift through the
evidence as it is brought out by
the two sides, without being in-

held in the sanctuary to provide
sociability for our monthly art
exhibit.

Reasons for choosing the
“Swing” for our service include:

1. The sermon topic was: “The
Philosophy of George Washing-
ton,”

2. Our guest speaker, the Rev-
erand Horace Barhelder, pastor
of First Parish Church, Ply-
mouth, Mass., founded in 1620
by the Pilgrims, is a W&L man,
class of 1937.

3. We wanted to have some-
thing in the service to thrill those
tourists present, especially from
Virginia and the Carolinas.

While I myself am a graduate
of Lafayette College, Easton, Pa.
—TI feel my partiality for W&L
and Princeton (acquired in later
years) to be an intrinsic value

byterian founded—which is what
I was originally.)

Enough is enough

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I would like to express my
thanks to the tri-captains of the
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team for their open letter to the
W&L fans in last week's Phi. As
a self-confessed over-zealous fan
it was a bitter pill to swallow.
Although I would never partici-
pate in, nor condone the racial
Jeering that was so evident in
the Morgan State game, I must
admit that my comments at
previous games could certainly

fluenced by evidence from the
original hearing.

The procedure for selecting the
jury for the public hearing was
changed to ensure an impartial
jury. The Chairman of the pub-
lic hearing will ask each pro-
spective juror, “Do you know
the accused personally?” Then
both sides will ask questions to
determine the extent of the re-
lationship. A close personal rela-
tionship with the accused will be
considered cause for striking the
prospective juror. This removes
the burden of deciding partiality
from the juror and places it on
the totally impartial Chairman,
the President of the Student Bar
Association. Each side will also
have two peremptory challenges,

The timing of the public trial
has also been changed. The old
rules specified that the public
trial must be held within fifteen
days after the private hearing.
Now it must be held within five
days; however, an extension can
be granted by the Chairman. This

be characterized as less than dis-
creet and my criticism of the
opposing team’s players as some-
what less than _ constructive.
Thus, I saw myself in that let-
ter and I hope it will change
the outlook of other Washington
and Lee fans the way I know it
has changed mine.

In the excitement of a W&L
game, particularly one such as
lacrosse where the fans are
separated from the opposing
team by some distance, it is
often easy to forget that there
are real people inside those
helmets and uniforms who think
and feel very much the way every
W&L player and fan thinks and
feels. They hate to lose as badly
as we do. For our fans to add
unnecessary insult to an already
painful loss can only diminish
Washington and Lee’s stature in
the eyes of every school we play.

Washington and Lee’s phe-
nomenal success in lacrosse is
even more amazing when consid-
ered in the light of the type of
non-subsidized sports program
we have, a program where team
members are student-athletes,
not just merchandize. In the
spirit of this type of program I
hope we can gain a new per-
spective on all of our athletic
contests and approach each game
with the same sense of sports-
manship that is exhibited by the
Washington and Lee players
themselves.

I don't intend to be any quieter
at the remaining lacrosse games
but I do intend to be a lot more
tactful.

Sincerely yours,
Dan Murphy ‘73

DEAR TRAVELLER—I don't understand. I went to cast my ballot
in Monday's Big Three elections, and I couldn't find Doug
Schwartz's name anywhere. I miss phrases like “viable alterna-

tive” and “executive fiat” and “B-L-T, hold the mayo.”

DEAR B—Sorry, kid, but Doug has been graduated to the real world,
where he now wears a three-piece suit over his cutoff blue jeans.
Rumor has it he'll be back in the Big Lex in May to defend Al
Black in an honor trial on charges of blatant averageness.

No, this year’s Big Three elections, named for the collective
IQ of the student body government, featured no such visible
and vociferous candidates as Mr. Schwartz. Indeed, the closest
thing to controversy in this year's election came when someone
found out that the candidates for president really did vote dif-
ferently from each other on at least one Separate occasion. (The
issue was that of what would the EC buy for itself for doing such
a fine job. Leland already had three letter openers; Mike, on the
other hand, wasn't sure how to open a pen knife without offend-
ing someone.)

Ah, but indications are that things will be picking up. This
year, for example, only one candidate ran unopposed. He actu-
ally lost to a write-in candidate, but the EC ruled the candidate
ineligible because he couldn't spell “EC” correctly, He was a
graduate of VMI, anyway.

Several candidates have already announced their intentions
to run for senior EC positions, even though the losers in the Big

Lacrosse Generals take two, drop one

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

If last week was any indica-
tion, Washington and Lee’s 1975
lacrosse season could provide a
few extra heart palpitations for
even the most sedate of the Gen-
erals’ fans.

Forced to play at, of all places,
Virginia’s Scott Stadium due to
the unvlayable condition of Wil-
son Ficld, the Generals needed
a four-goal rally late in the game
to beaut Connecticut, 9-7, on
Tuesday, then turned around the
next day to waltz to a 23-2 win
over Duke.

W&L then said goodbye again
to the offense in dropping a 9-6
verdict to perennial club power
Mount Washington in Baltimore
on Saturday.

It was three different W&L
teams at each of the games.
Against Connecticut the Generals
again showed the hesitation that
might have been the fatal factor

Rainy weather
disrupts W&L
game schedules

The weather played havoe with
Washington and Lee's spring
athletic teams last week, forcing
several postponements and can-
cellations as well as the moving
of two home lacrosse games to
the Astroturf-equipped Scott
Stadium in Charlottesville.

Rain, snow, and the resulting
wet grounds prevented the W&L
baseball and golf teams from
seeing any action. The baseball
team saw three games washed
out, while the golfers’ first match
in Virginia Beach, scheduled for
Friday, was also postponed.

With the exception of the la-
crosse team, only W&L’s tennis
squad played last week, The net-
ters split a pair of matches, beat-
ing Haverford College, 9-0, while
falling to Dartmouth, 7-2.

Sophomore Jim Fisher main-
tained a perfect 3-0 record with

wins in both of his singles
matches last week. Freshman Ben
Jones joined Fisher as W&L’'s
lone winners against Dart-
mouth.

W&L's tennis record is now
2-1.

in the loss to Morgan State.
Against Duke, however, W&L let
everything loose, and the romp
that resulted almost got to be
a bore, even for the players.

At Mount Washington, the
Generals again were hampered
by an inability to find the back
of the goal, going scoreless for
almost 36 minutes in the second,
third, and early fourth quarters.

It was an inconsistancy W&L
can ill afford with what may be
the toughest week in school his-
tory facing the Generals in the
next eight days.

The week in review:

Apparently Connecticut heard
what Morgan State did to W&L
in the Generals’ season opener
and decided that they wanted to
get in on the “beat the big guy”
act.

After Donny Carroll put W&L
on the scoreboard just 15 seconds
into the game, the visitors pro-
ceeded to score four straight
goals, with attackman Jerry Har-
ris getting three of them.

The Generals then got goals
from Scott Baugher, Rob Morgan,
and Ken Miller to even the score
at 4-4 at halftime, then took a
5-4 lead on Mark Derbyshire's
tally early in the third period.

But Connecticut again stopped
W&L cold, this time scoring three
straight goals to take a 7-5 lead.
Harris got his fourth while mid-
fielder Rex Hong scored twice to
give the visitors a two-goal lead
with nine minutes left.

Unlike the Morgan State game,
however, the Generals came back
from a deficit late in the game
to pull out a win. Morgan scored
his second goal in an extra man
situation to pull W&L within one,
then Carroll got two unassisted
goals in a row to give the Gen-
erals the lead for good,

W&L then effectively stalled
out much of the remaining five
minutes until Miller picked up his
second goal with just 33 seconds
left.

* ae 6

Almost everyone except the
scorekeeper got into the act
against Duke, with 15 players
hitting the scoring column in the
23-2 romp.

After leading 3-0 in the first
quarter, the Generals exploded
for ten goals in the second period,
while the Blue Devils scored but
once.

W&L's defense broke down once
early in the third quarter to give
Duke their second goal, but then
stiffened to shut the Blue Devils
out for the last 26 minutes.

Carroll had a field day, scoring
six goals and adding four assists.
Sophomore attackman Boyd
Martin picked up five goals in
his first start, while Martin’s
classmate, midfielder Jack Dud-
ley, had four goals and an assist.

Junior Jim Englehart had a
pair of goals, while single tallis
went to Morgan, Derbyshire, Jay
Monahan, Sandy Bishop, Spenny
Neale, and Chris Larson.

Both Malcolm Hastings and
freshman Charlie Brown played
one half in the nets for W&L.
Hastings made nine saves in the
first 30 minutes while allowing
one goal, while Brown collected
six stops in the second half, giv-
ing up just one score.

a 4a oe

An offensive shutdown of 36
minutes cost the Generals any
chance for a win over club
power Mount Washington.

In fact, the final score might
have been more than 9-6 had
it not been for the goalie play of
Charlie Brown.

Brown the starting assignment,
and he responded with 22 saves,
several of the spectacular variety.

The Generals took a 2-1 lead
late in the first quarter on goals
by Scott Baugher and Charlie
Stieff. Then the Wolkpack’s de-
fense, led by former W&L All-
American Don Eavenson, stopped
the Generals cold over the sec-
ond and third quarters while
scoring seven straight goals to
take an 8-2 lead.

W&L fought back late in the
game on two goals by Dudley
and single scores by Carroll and
Bishop, but it proved to be too
little too late,

Don Krohn led Mount Wash-
ington with three goals. Two of
the Wolfpack’s goals were scored
by two more ex-All-Americans at
W&L, attackman Sam Englehart
and midfielder Skip Lichtfuss.

Now the Generals face the
toughest week on their schedule,
and for that matter, what may
be the toughest one week of
lacrosse any team in the nation
might face this year.

W&L plays three games in six
days next week against three na-
tionally-ranked teams, all of
whom regard the Generals as
THE opponent on their schedules
in the early season.

ing Green, undefeated last year

Six swimmers travel to
NCAA meet in Penna.

Washington and Lee swim-
ming coach Bill Stearns and six
of his swimmers are at Alleghany
College in Meadville, Pa. this
weekend for the NCAA Division
III national swimming and div-
ing championships.

Heading the list is freshman
John Hudson, holder of four
state and five school records, who
will be a strong favorite in five
events—the 200-, 500- and 1650-
yard freestyles and the 400- and
800-yard freestyle relays. Hud-
son has the fastest Division III
time in the country in the 500
and 1650, and ranks second in
the 200.

W&L team captain Will Broth-
erton is entered in six events: the
50-, 100- and 200-yard freestyles,

the 100-yard butterfly, and the
two freestyle relays.

Sophomore Tad Van Leer, who
holds four W&L records, will
swim in the same events as
Brotherson except the butterfly.
Senior Dick Barber and sopho-
more Trip Wornom are entered
in the 50- and 100-yard free-
styles and the 400-yard freestyle
relay, while junior Bill Tiers will
swim in the 200-freestyle and
800-relay.

Exceptional performances at
Alleghany not only will mean
All-American status for W&L’'s
swimmers but will qualify them
for the NCAA Division I meet the
next weekend at Cleveland State
University.

There is a substantial penalty
clause written into the contract,
with financial compensation ac-

W&L could possibly sue in court

not completed by September. But
here we are again, in virtually
the same situation as last year.
We had done full assignments

Although placing more con-
fidence in the May 1 target date,
Parsons still worries about the
students’ attitudes toward the
whole drawn-out affair. ‘The
University’s main concern is that
we are forced to present these
apartments to the student with
a condition of uncertainty that
we don’t like. It is not our desire
to offer these units under such
a cloud of uncertainty.”

And a cloud of uncertainty it
is, as the apartments slowly take
shape down by Wood’s Creek,
and as students cross the foot-
bridge and wonder if the hous-
ing project will be completed by

Student Curriculum Committee’s survey results given

The results of the Student Cur-
riculum Committee's 1974 fall
term survey, rating the courses,
examinations, and teachers of
W&L, has just been released. Ac-
cording to Lawrence Lyles,
chairman of the committee, the
whole effort has been extremely
successfuly, owing particularly to
the overall cooperation of the
students and faculty.

Since instigating the survey
last year, the curriculum com-
mittee has incorporated several
changes in the survey itself. For
example, the evaluation of the
courses based on student answers
to pertinent questions have been
tabulated on a four-point scale
(A-four), in order for students
and faculty to interpret the re-
sults more accurately. In addi-
tion, department averages as well
as averages for the university
have been added to the computa-
tions.

“Every effort has been made to
insure the accuracy of these re-
sults,” stated Lyles, “and I hope

will find this report informative
and useful.” Furthermore, Lyles
emphasized that the results of
the first surveys, conducted dur-
ing the 1973-74 school year, were
extremely helpful and they mani-
festly showed that the students
and faculty are interested in sur-
veys of this type.

In rating the overall depart-
ments, the Physics, Math, and
Journalism departments received
the lowest ratings, while the

encourages a prompt public trial,
which will help prevent wide-

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, APRIL 17, 1975

 

WéeLca

The American Revolution Bi-
centennial Administration has
designated Washington and Lee
University, the second-oldest col-
lege in Virginia and the sixth-
oldest in America, as a Bicenten-
nial College Campus.

The university is only the sec-
ond Virginia institution to re-
ceive the designation, The Col-
lege of William and Mary was
similarly honored earlier this
year,

W&L was founded in 1749—27
years before the signing of the
Declaration of Independence.

On May 13, 1776, it became
the first academic institution in
the Colonies to cast its lot with
the growing sentiment in favor
of independence, when trustees
of what was then called Augusta
Academy formally renamed the
school ‘‘Liberty Hall.”

Among the projects in Wash-
ington and Lee’s officially en-
dorsed American Bicentennial
program are these:

—The current nationwide tour

of a number of historic portraits
once owned by the families of
George Washington and Robert
E. Lee, including the priceless
first portrait ever to have been
painted of Washington himself;

—Another two-year national
tour, sponsored by the Smith-
sonian Institution, of some 200
pieces of rare Chinese export
porcelain from the 18th and
early-19th centuries, all with
decorations reflecting Revolu-
tionary-era political, cultural,
economic, religious and aesthetic
influences;

—An intensive, professionally
directed archaeological “dig” now
being conducted at the ruins of
Liberty Hall Academy, the re-
sults of which are expected to
provide new evidence about aca-
demic life two centuries ago;

—The 1976 Mock Democratic
Convention being planned by
W&L's student body, already
recognized on its own as a Vir-
ginia Bicentennial Event;

—And completion in 1976 of

Applications exceed
law seats by 13-1

A total of 1,050 applications
for admission to the law school—
more than 13 applications for
every available place in next
fall’s first-year class—was re-
corded by W&L this spring.

Reflecting a nationwide trend,
the total number of applications
was down about 9 per cent, from
1,150 a year ago. But according
to a report this week from Roy
L, Steinheimer Jr., dean of the
School of Law, the quality of
applicants was up significantly.
“The class we have admitted for
September should be the best
we have ever had,” he said.

About a quarter of the 80 first-
year students next fall will be
women, Steinheimer reported.
The law school is the only di-
vision to admit women. It be-
eame fully coeducational in 1972,
and will graduate its first women
students next month,

The 1,050 applications receiv-

ed for 1975 admission came from
students in 275 undergraduate
institutions in 46 states, Stein-
heimer reported.

He attributed the increase in
the quality of applicants this
year largely to “self-selection” —
an increased awareness among
potential applicants of W&L’'s
selectivity. Because of the uni-
versity’s unusually high admis-
sions standards, the dean said,
marginal students appear to be
ruling themselves out, and not
even applying.

Contributing to the modest de-
cline in the overall number of
applications is the well-publiciz-
ed “glut” of law-school gradu-
ates, Steinheimer said. Last
month the U.S. Labor Depart-
ment predicted the number of
law graduates will continue to
outpace nationwide demand for
new lawyers at least through
1985.

the initial portion of W&L’s “De-
velopment Program for the
1970s,” by raising $36 million, of
which more than 75 per cent has
been realized already.

In addition, the university
radio station, WLUR-FM, re-
cently became the first college
broadcast facility in the nation
to join the national Bicentennial
College Network. WLUR’s three-
times-a-week feature program,
“Bicentennial Reports,” is made
available to ther members of the
network under ARBA sponsor-
ship.

Washington and Lee’s Ameri-

can Bicentennial program is
closely aligned with the joint
Lexington and Rockbridge

County Bicentennial observance,
directed by Dr. Leon F. Sensa-
baugh, a professor of history and
dean emeritus of Washington
and Lee.

The university officially began
its commemoration of the Ameri-
can Revolution in 1973 with the
dedication of its Front Campus

mpusrecognized .

as a National Historic Landmark
and publication of a brief il-
lustrated architectural history of
its historic academic buildings.

With the Front Campus nam-
ed a National Landmark two
years ago and the Lee Chapel
similarly recognized in 1963,
W&L is one of the few college
campuses in America naving re-
ceived two such designations—
the highest that can be con-
ferred on a private site by the
federal government. Interesting-
ly, Virginia Military Institute,
founded in 1839 and adjoining
the W&L campus, in Lexington,
is one of the others with two
Historic Landmarks.

The school was renamed Wash-
ington Academy in 1798, in
gratitude for George Washing-
ton’s generous endowment to the
struggling college. His gift still is
a part of W&L’s endowment fund.

Robert E. Lee accepted the job
as president of the University
afte rthe Civil War because of
his admiration for Washington.

On Tuesday, April 8, Robert Carl Peniston died after
a heart failure suffered in Richmond. He was to have
graduated next month with a Bachelor of Science de-
gree in business administration. He was a Dean's List
student and an active member of Phi Kappa Sigma fra-

The funeral service was conducted last Friday in
RK. I. Lee Memorial Church on campus by the Reverand
LD). Holmes Irving, pastor, and Captain Charles I. Keyser,
staff chaplain at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola
where Peniston’s father, Captain Robert C. Peniston, is
stationed. The burial followed in Stonewall Jackson
Cemetery, Lexington. He is survived by his parents and
a sister, Lisa Peniston, a sophomore at Randolph-Macon
Woman's College in Lynchburg.

Peniston’s career here was in many ways an exemplar
of what remained of the old school W&L. We remember
being told when we first arrived on campus that W&L
was the type of school at which men partied hard on
the weekends and studied hard during the week. If any-
one still here lived up to that description it was Peniston,
lle was a good student and a good man who took ad-
vantage of the opportunity afforded him at W&L, and
he will be remembered and missed by those who knew
him for a long time to come.

 

 

 

 

 

‘Changing Room’ termed realistic

By MIKE FERRARA

The University Theatre pre-
sented to the W&L community
(right before finals) its pro-
duction of The Changing Room,
This play, written by David
Storey, revolved around the
rough sport of rugby, as played
by the lower-classes in England.

All the “action” of the play
took place not on the rugby
field, but in the locker room,
where we witnessed various ex-
changes between the different
members of the team. We saw the
old lazy janitor speak of the
Communist menace with the
pompous “Patsy.” and the hard-

Jim Overton
lectures Don Hogle

as the owner of the rugby team
John Moore
and Derrick Woods on the finer points o/ beat-

working but unlucky “Kenny”
treasure his newly-purchased
power tools—to be used to make
shelves to house books he does
not have. The audience laughed
with the outspoken but slightly
obnoxius “Walsh,” and sympa-
thized with “Sandy,” the assist-
ant trainer, who took the blame
for another's misconduct. We
began to judge Sir Frederick, the
club owner, for his somewhat
eallous and aloof attitude, and
in general, we proceeded to get
involved in this slice of these
men's lives, a slice which we per-
ceived was not enjoyed by some
of them as sport, but treated as

a part of their economic survival.

These reactions on the part of
the audience showed the achieve-
ment of the actors in portraying
the desired characters. If the dif-
ferent personalities had not
seemed real, the play certainly
would have been very dull to
watch. But fortunately. one re-
ceived that certain flavor (and
aroma) of a men’s locker room,
along with the antics and crises
that usually develop in such
places, from the comical urgings
of “Walsh” in the shower to the
calming presence of the trainer

and ‘lime

lift). Of course, these occurences
are all quite familiar to your
average W&L jock. but some
things about the play were rather
foreign to the Lexington stage.

The Changing Room was uni-
que in several respects. First of
all, it was done without a lot of
physical action by the players.
Everything the audience saw took
place in the locker room: this
eonsisted mainly of each of the
characters interacting with one
another in fast-paced dialogue
The play was not trying to con-
vey a deep “message,"’ except the
one conveyed by the everyday
occurances in the rugby player's
lives. Secondly, there was a bit
of nudity in the play, which
greatly enhanced the sense of
realism already established by
the excellent and accurate sets
utilized in the production. The
Drama Division should be com-
mended for pulling something
like that off ‘pun intended) in
conservative old Lexington
Thirdly the actors had to learn
Yorkshire accents for the per-
formance, a very difficult task
indeed. The accents were con-
vinicing to the extent that one
could not understand what was
being said half the time, but they
did tend to deteriorate toward
the end of the play.

Despite their faltering accents

the entire cast should be con-
gratulated on a fine job. The
production Was thoroughly en-
joyed by nearly everyone who

Was able to see it in the Theatre's
cramped quarters. It has been
suggested, though, that the play
be updated to include a co-ed
room; that would really
get the town in a frenzy df you
can imagine that). I personally
think it Was enough to bring
such a new and different play
to Lexington. in order to eive

Unfriendliness at the
Law School

We understand that several students were forced to leave
a Law School party last Saturday night. We find it impossible
to understand this action by the responsible parties. The
undergraduate students were told that the party at Zollman’s
was closed to them and that only law students and _ their
dates might attend.

The undergraduate students had brought with them their
own liquor, and were not consuming the alcohol supplied by
the law students and kept at their bar; the undergraduate
students were not drinking liquor that they had not previ-
ously paid for, In addition the undergraduate students offered
to pay an admission fee and were the guests of law students.

We find the expulsion of the students involved unwarranted
and evidence of hypocrisy on the part of the law students
responsible. Members of the Law School are free to attend
parties thrown for and funded by the undergraduate division,
even though law students pay no class dues for such functions,
unlike undergraduate students. Frequently law students show
up at fraternity parties, again using facilities and supplies
paid for by others.

This is not to chastise members of the Law School for
attending such functions. Indeed, most fraternity
parties are open to anyone wishing to attend, as are Uni-
versity parties (usually for a nominal fee). What disturbs
us is the fact that these same law students, supposedly
well-attuned to the inequities in our society and resolved to
correct these faults, have proceeded to ignore these precepts
in their social lives. By expelling undergraduate students
(and there could not have been many, as most students were
still on Spring Break), the law students involved exhibited
an extreme lack of tolerance and fairness.

social

The members of the undergraduate school could retaliate
by closing all future parties to any persons except dues-paying
undergraduates and their dates. Then the law school could
hold its parties exclusively for law students without fear of
appearing hypocritical; each school could party in splendid
isolation from the other. There would be extra work involved
for those who organize the parties, as all guests would have
to be carded and uninvited, i.e. nonpaying, persons asked to
leave. Relations between the two schools would become more
strained than they already are, and the fact that all parties
would be closed would tend to create a more artificial atmos-
phere at these events.

Apparently this is the course of action desired hy those
members of the Law School who were involved. By their action
they have indicated that although they may come to our
parties, we are not the most welcome of guests at their
gatherings. We feel that, in all due fairness to the undergradu-
such action is uncalled for and fosters more ill
feeling between the two divisions—mutual animosity we do
not need. Admittedly, we find it rather difficult to believe
that any undergraduates would want to attend a party spon-
sored by the Law School in the first place, but if that is the
case, they should be welcomed or, at least, allowed to remain.

Ramey joins administration

 

 

 

Thomas B. Ramey III, a senior at W&L, has been appointed
assistant admissions director for 1975-76.

Periodically Washington and Lee employs a new graduate as
an admissions assistant. Like his predecessors, Ramey will also

be assistant dean of students.

Ramey is a Dean's list student, president of the Interfrat-
ernity Council, a member of Sigma Chi fraternity, and a dormitory
counselor. He will receive his B.S. in business administration this

May.

In his new post, which he will assume in mid-August, Ramey
will be a member of the admissions and financial-aid committees.
He will travel extensively to secondary schools throughout the
nation and will conduct on-campus interviews with prospective

students.

Local policeman
silences student

March 20, 1975
To the Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

I feel it is my duty and honor
to leak the true story of the Lex-
ington One. Today I was leisurely
strolling down Washington Street
on my way to dinner. En route
I passed, as always, this City’s
hallowed citadel of Law and
Order, Lexington City Hall. This
center of Propriety and Good
Works controls the vast army of
Lexington Policemen. I passed
this building, as always, with all
due Respect.

Having lived in this City for
three years. I am no longer
amazed when I am passed by
four Police Cars, eagle eyes ready
to locate every breach of moral
law peering out of Them, on each
and every block. Also, I have
come to accept the fact that
there are, maybe, 3000 college
students in this town, most of
whom I am sure are actively
plotting the fall of City Govern-
ment.

In light of this, 1 was not
particularly bothered when, on
the way to dinner, the usual
liberal ration of Police Cars
passed by. However, the sight of
that noble, ubiquitous three-
wheeler that looks like an ice
cream truck, but actually is an
instrument of Law Enforcement,
amused me so much that I point-
ed this hilarious riot preventing
device out to my companions.
and began to laugh.

The three of us took another
ten steps or so, in which time
we heard the now past Cushman
make an illegal “U" turn and

CW. POST

 

accelerate to its top speed,
rumored to be more than twenty
miles an hour. In what seemed
like the twinkling of an eye, but
was probably more like five sec-
onds, the Cushman had caught
up to us.

The Vehicle stopped, and a
voice called out of it, ordering my
friends on, but detaining me.
This Enforcer of the Law told me
that my acts of pointing and
laughing could land me in jail.
I was told that this obviously
intelligent, learned man felt
“stupid” and “ignorant” when
my illegal act was directed at
him, (Premeditated Laughter?)
Henceforth, he said, if 1 wanted
to be “safe” in Lexington, I must
keep my “hands in my pockets”
and “always look straight ahead.”

In light of my greivous crime,
I feel fortunate to have been
allowed to go to dinner by this
more-than-generous Policeman.
Indeed, I am so thankful that 1,
once a hardened criminal, have
repented, and now I beg my fel-
low students, for their own
safety, to refrain from such
crimes as Laughing in Public,
Laughing with Malice of Fore-
thought, or Laughing with the
Intent to Amuse.

Respectfully,
Michael Spaulding, ‘76
cc: City Manager

Your encounter with the boys
in blue uniforms does not sur-
prise us in the least. However,
the fact that you have sent a

is not the ease. Mr. Doane ap-

Ask Traveller

 

DEAR TRAVELLER—I can’t take it any longer. I don’t mind putting
up with the food at the Commons, but it just got to be too
much when they decided to co-sponsor (with the SAB) a cream-
ed corn chugging contest. And I wouldn’t have minded the
Polish-American meal last week, but it’s tough to eat kielbasa
with a rubber fork. Are there any places in town which might
lend a friendlier and more palatable atmosphere?

(Signed) C. Wagon

DEAR CHUCK-—Dining out in greater Lexington can be a real treat,
if you know where to go. Many a gourmet has traveled hundreds
of miles just to feast upon the specialties of the houses in Lex-

ington’s finer

establishments. Some of those establishments

and their choicest offerings include:

—Uncle Bob's Place Uocated behind Lee Chapel). Featur-
ing the finest recipes from Paris, London, Rome, and Hartz
Mountain, Dine in the elegance of the Lee mausoleum, Ask
for “Revenuer Stew,” a fine recipe from the backwoods of the

Blue Ridge Mountains.

—Fred’s Oceanview Inn (ocated atop House Mountain).
Dine next to the magnificent Olympic sized pool of imported
ocean water. The more daring adventurers can swim the pool
and catch their dinner from the selection of moray eel, shark,
man-o’-war jellyfish, and other delicacies available.

—Penneyburgers (located east of West Lexington, or is it
west of East Lexington). Name refers to size, not price, of their
speciality. Also features fried chick-'n’-rats, a popular South-
ern recipe, along with fried milkshakes. The Alpo labels on the
floor add to the general decor.

— Sue's Ice Cream and Massage Parlor (in Roanoke). Ask

for the double-dip special.

DEAR TRAVELLER—What do I get for the man who has every-

thing?

Letters to the Editor...

intimidate all the members of the
Lexington community; he is at-
tempting to make this once
sleepy little hamlet resemble
Times Square. After saturating
the downtown area with stop
lights and one-way streets, ply-
wood obstructions and torn-up
streets, he is now invading the
suburbs, eg., his maze of stop
lights at the corner of Houston
and Main. We doubt that a man
who makes it a chore for citizens
to drive through Lexington will
show much concern for a student
who cannot walk the streets and
talk to his friends without being
accosted.

Campaign practices

violate privacy

To the Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

On returning to our house on
Thornhill Road this past Sunday,
‘March 22), we discovered cam-
paign flyers, for a certain candi-
date for Senior E.C. Representa-
tive. in each of our bedrooms.
The house had been left with
both doors closed. Will there
never be an end to the assault on
our privacy, our sensibilities, and
our pursuit of what passes for
happiness at W&L? Not to men-
tion the waste of paper. It's bad
enough to have these aspiring
puppy politicos disrupting fra-
ternal meais with their mean-
ingless harangues, plastering
their worthless “democratic”
trash on frat house walls, and
calling time after time to deliver
their wasted spiel. But what
gives them the right to enter our
private residence, with neither
our presence nor our permission
nor even our acquaintance, and

Alterations in cheers
suggested by student

To the Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

The word is out, W&L fans
are going to “clean up their act.”
However, since W&L fans are
not about to lose their status as
the nation’s number one lacrosse
fans. we must learn to rely on
creativity instead of obscenity.
In some instances, old cheers
can be revived through new
words. For instance, instead of
“Go to hell, Navy, go to hell,”
an afternoon at Wilson Field
might turn up “Get thee hence,
Navy, get thee hence.” Similarly,
“What the hell's a Wahoo?”
might reappear as “Can you de-
fine a Wahoo?’ What to do about
comments about the referee re-
mains a distinct problem, as the
black and white striped seems
to Craw out the vilest nature of
fans, and how many times dur-
ing a game can the fan call out
“Ref beats his wife,” before the
boos are directed at him.

Pan drunkedness can be easily
conquered by refusing admittance
to Sigma Nus (who are always

drunk), and not letting the
SAE's finish their beer at the
gate.

Outlook on the world of college lacrosse

HOW TO FILL SPACE IN
THE FIRST ISSUE OF THE
PHI IN ALMOST A MONTH
WHEN YOU DON’T HAVE
MUCH TO WRITE ABOUT
OTHER THAN OLD NEWS:

It took a while to come up
with a solution to this problem.
However, after consultation with
advisers in Baltimore, Long
Island, and Muleshoe, Texas, the
answer was obvious: try to fill
the folks in on how the wacky,
messed-up world of college la-
crosse stands today.

When you left for your vaca-
tions on the Florida beaches or
in your home living rooms, things
were already in turmoil, New
names like Morgan State, Penn
State, UMBC, and Roanoke were
competing for headline space
with John Hopkins, Cornell, and
Maryland.

Now it’s gotten even more com-
plicated, There are no fewer than
12 teams in competition for the
NCAA Division I tournament
berths. while at least 10 teams
have a legitimate chance for bids
in the College Division.

What we thought we would do
this week was to provide you
with a capsule look at the con-
tenders to Johns Hopkins’ crown
in Division I, in the order of the
latest United States Intercollegi-
ate Lacrosse Association’s (USI
LA) poll.

The top twelve:

1. JOHNS HOPKINS (5-0):
The Blue Jays are back with
another powerhouse to defend
their 1974 title. Observers call the
1975 Jays their “most aggressive
and best stickworking team in
several years.” First-year coach

ee

neh Ae Ne
he te

 

Henry Cicciarone has the ser-
vices of one of the nation’s most
balanced attacks in Franz Wit-
tlesberger, Rich Hirsch, and
freshman Mike O'Neill.
Dale Kohler, Tom Myrick, and
Don Zimmerman lead a deep
group of midfielders, while sopho-
more Kevin Mahon returns in
goal. The only question mark for
Hopkins lies with the close de-
fense, where graduation cost the
Jays two starters. The defense
will be severely tested Saturday
when Hopkins collides with num-
ber two Cornell. Also left on the
Hopkins schedule are games with
Navy, Army, Brown, and Mary-
land (May 17).

9. CORNELL (7-0): The Big
Red, NCAA champions in 1972,
could take the title north of the
Mason-Dixon line again if their
defense comes together, Cornell
coach Richie Moran can _ boast
to having the most explosive at-
tack in college lacrosse, with
Canadian Mike French pairing
up with sophomore phenom
Eamon McEaneany for an aver-
age of eight goals a game. Add
to that other first-line players
like Jon Levine and middies Bill
Marino and Tom Dolan and its
no wonder why Cornell scores so
much. The Big Red’s weakness,
like Hopkins, is an untested de-
fense. The loss of second-team
All-American goalie Mike Em-
merich had to hurt. The show-
down with Hopkins on Saturday
could tell a lot. Also left for
Cornell are games with Cortland
State, Penn and Princeton.

3. MARYLAND (2-0): The
Terps play the lightest schedule
of anyone in the top 12, which

helps in the way of experience.
But Buddy Bearmore’s troops
have seen two NCAA title games
running, so the lack of playing
time shouldn’t hurt. What has
hurt are injuries to key players
like attackman Ed Mullen (out
for the year following knee surg-
ery), middies Frank Urso, Roger
Tuck, and Doug Radebaugh (all
playing with nagging injuries),
defenseman Tom Murray
(broken leg), and goalie Gary
Niels (sprained ankle). Junior
college transfer Bert Caswell car-
ries much of the scoring load for
Maryland, while Urso and Tuck
chip in for a few points each
game. Mike Farrell, an All-
American last year, anchors the
Terp defense. Sophomore Jake
Reed, the victim of the Johns
Hopkins barrage in last year’s
title game has replaced Niels in
goal, Left on the Maryland sched-
ule are Virginia (this Saturday
in Charlottesville), Navy, Army,
and Johns Hopkins.

4, VIRGINIA (5-2): A one-
goal overtime loss to Johns
Hopkins in the season opener
and a two-goal setback at the
hands of Maryland-Baltimore
County are the only blemishes
so far on the Cavaliers’ season
slate. But the Wahoos have not
won a game over a top team yet—
their first chance comes Satur-
day against Maryland in Charlot-
tesville. The team’s top-player to
date is goalie Rodney Rullman,
who is playing up to his full
potential after two years of up
and down play. The rest of the
team is good, but there is no
one star player who carries the
offensive load. Left for the Cavs
are matches with Maryland,
Towson State, Navy, and W&L.

5. HOFSTRA (5-1): They lost
their opener to Penn, 17-3 (that’s
right, by 14 goals), then turned
around to beat Towson State by
five, Princeton by 12, yes sir, 12,
and W&L and Army by one goal
in overtime games. The Hofstra
zone defense still gives opponents
fits, and players like Phil Marino,
Bob Hiller, and Tom Calder would
like nothing more than to give
25-year head coach Howdy Myers
a national title as a going-away
present. Hofstra still has games
with Navy and Rutgers left.

6. PRINCETON (4-2); Basic-
ally the same team that beat
W&L on March 25, 11-7. They've
picked up one goal wins over
North Carolina and Navy since
tnen, but have also been blown-
out victims of Hopkins (22-11)
and Hofstra (17-5). The Tigers
are young and should be watched
in the future. To get to the
tournament Princeton needs to
play well from here on out
against Army, Penn, Brown,
Rutgers, and Cornell.

and Lee came close to the Mid-
shipmen as far as scheduling
as many top teams as possible.
But the Middies, 14-8 winners
over the Generals on March 28,
get the nod for the roughest
schedule around, Every team in
the top ten this week except
Brown shows up on the Navy
slate. Add to that the number
two and three college division
teams this week, Towson State
and UMBC, and it’s obvious why
Dick Szlasa has to get his team
in tip-top shape. Midfielder Bob
DeSimone, a clinch All-American
who personally beat W&L with
seven goals, leads a cast of hun-
dreds at midfield. All-American
Jake Lawlor gets the job done
on defense, while Jeff Long leads
the attack. Goalie Bill Mueller’s
ankle injury cost Navy a chance
against Cornell as well as the
Princeton game (15-14).

8. RUTGERS: The Scarlet
Knights have good talent but not
enough of it—after the first wave
there is little backing up. Mike
Rink and John Dinowski com-
bine for a strong attack, while
Rick Fornaro leads the midfields.
Rutgers is one of the teams W&L
must beat to stay alive—that
game comes up on May 10. Rutg-
ers also has games against Navy,
Penn State, and Princeton left
on their schedule.

9. BROWN: Here could lie the
real sleeper of the top 12. The
same that holds true for Hopkins
and Cornell goes here—Brown
has a potent offense, led by Tom
Rothman, Steve Meister, and Bob
Mueller, but lacks talent and ex-
perience on defense, Their low-

est goal output of the year was
12 against Cornell, but they
yielded 17 in the same game.
Brown has yet to face Johns
Hopkins, Penn, and Massachu-
setts.

10. WASHINGTON AND LEE
(4-4): See for yourself against
the Maryland Lacrosse Club on
Saturday, North Carolina State
on Sunday, and, if you can make
the trip to Chapel Hill, against
North Carolina on Wednesday.

A word of caution—you might
not be seeing the team you saw
before the spring break.

11 and 12. PENN and NORTH
CAROLINA: Penn has to win its
last three games against Prince-
ton, Cornell, and Brown to stand
a chance of getting a tournament
pid, while UNC, now 3-7 on the
year, has had no luck whatso-
ever. It’s the Tar Heels best team
ever, but that doesn’t necessarily
mean that wins come for just
the asking,

Tennis up to 10-4 mark;
other teams lag behind

To catch up on what has hap-
pened in past weeks:

W&L’s lacrosse Generals are
now 4-4 after a 14-13 sudden
death loss to Hofstra and a 15-
10 win over Cortland State on
the annual spring trip.

Bob Hiller’s fourth goal of the
game almost four minutes into
the sudden death period was the
winning tally for Hofstra, who
won their fourth in a row.

Rob Morgan led W&L with four
goals. Dave Warfield, in his first
game since recovering from a
knee injury, added two goals and
four assists.

Morgan scored seven times
while Warfield added four goals
and three assists in leading the
Generals to a second straight win
over Cortland State.

Trailing 6-4 at intermission,
W&L got fine performances from
faceoff specialist Brent Miller
and all three midfields to turn
the game around in the second
half. The Generals scored the
last six goals of the game.

The tennis Generals are 10-4
on the year following Tuesday's
5-4 win over Virginia Tech.

W&L’s spring trip to Florida
saw three matches cancelled due
to a tack of contractual agree-

The baseball Generals’ slump
continues, as W&L dropped a
doubleheader Tuesday to Bridge-
water, 10-6 and 15-4,

W&L is now 2-13 on the year,
and are currently in the midst
of a five-game losing streak.

Washington and Lee’s golf
team finished seventh overall and
fourth among college division
teams in the annual state tourna-
ment at The Homestead in Hot
Springs last weekend.

Led py Jerry Maatman’s 81-
77—-158, the Generals compiled
a team score of 658 to place
fourth in the college division be-
hind Hampden-Sydney (626),
Madison (635) and George Ma-
son (642). A total of 16 Virginia
colleges competed in the event.

Washington and Lee won six
events but dropped an 87-58
track meet to Davidson College
last weekend.

W&L also competed in the
Davidson Relays, with the spring
mediey team placing second and
the 880 team gaining a fourth
place. Seventeen teams competed
in the event.

Unlike most sports, the lacrosse
world is a very tight-knit group

been close friends for many years.

Unknowingly, I am sure, the
W&L fans were beginning to un-

ravel some of these threads, to

the detriment of their coaches
and players who were working
so hard to promote lacrosse.
Respect for any opponent can
only enhance W&L's position in

been at one time the only W&L

easier to give Washington and

On Friday night, April 25th,
the Student Activities Board
opens its spring social calendar
with a concert featuring one of
Motown’'s hottest and most dur-
able groups, the fabulous Four
‘Tops.

Founded in 1954 by Abdul Fa-
kir, Levi Stubbs, Renaldo Ben-
son, and Lawrence Paxton, the
band gained national promi-
hence and popularity through
the release of such hits as “I
Can’t Help Myself,’ “Baby, I
Need Your Loving,’ and “Same
Old Song.” The Tops have been
described as ‘‘Motown’s Number
1 recording group” and have ap-
peared twice previously at W&L,
last in 1968 and once in 1966,
when they headlined the Open-
ings Weekend “Motown Sound”
concert. Few groups have enjoy-

Lectures, piano
recital here

by the Phi News Staff

Lee Chapel and duPont Audi-
torium will be put to good use in
the coming week, as a number of
lectures and other events will be
held.

Tonight in duPont Auditorium
a lecture will be presented by Dr.
George Borgstom of Michigan
State University. Borgstrom’s ad-
dress is entitled, “Food: The Glo-
bal Crisis.’ Sponsored by the
Economics Department and the
University Center in Virginia,
his appearance here should in-
terest anyone concerned about
the Malthusian spectre of mass
starvation. He is one of the fore-
most experts in world food pro-
duction and its relationship with
the ever-increasing world popu-
lation. Borgstrom will also ap-
pear in the Interdepartmental
course on the Human Population
Problem.

Also to be held tonight is a
piano recital in Lee Chapel. The
students of Charles Markley, a
local piano instructor, will per-
form pieces ranging from quite
clementary etudes to a Beethoven
sonata, The recital is open to the

popularity, either at W&L or
anywhere else.

Appearing with the Four Tops
wil be Les Variations, a French-
Moroccan group which has been
described, appropriately enough,
as “France’s Number 1 recording
group.” While probably unfami-
liar to most W&L students, Les
Variations are very popular in
Europe and have performed with
such noteworthies as Paul Mc-
Cartney, Jimi Hendrix, Cream,
the Who, and the Stones. The
group sings in English, and their
sound, according to Rolling Stone
magazine, is “solid exciting rock
music with an exotic twist.”

Opening Friday's concert will
be Lady Luck, billed as (get
ready) “Virginia’s Top New
Group.” The show begins at 8:00
P.M. in Old Doremus, with tic-
kets modestly priced at $4.50 in
advance and $5.00 at the door.

This spring’s University Grain
Party, sponsored by the junior
class, is scheduled for Saturday,
May 10. According to class presi-
dent Gary Seldomridge, the deci-
sion to make May 9-11 Springs
Weekend was made before it be-
came apparent that the Four
‘Tops would be unable to perform
here that weekend. Thus the Uni-
versity will now have two big
party weekends this spring. It is
still unclear whether or not SAB
wil have a big-name band in

junior class party will be held in
Red Square or at Zollman’s Pa-

Othello, The Tempest
Two spring plays

By JESS REEVES

While many departments do
not fully utilize the opportunity
presented by the Spring Term,
Drama 139, Total Theatre, makes
the most of every minute afford-
ed it by a six-week period. Those
who join the spring troupe at the
Troubadour Theatre find that
they sacrifice a great deal of
time, in excess of eight hours a
day, to their muse, but the re-
ward of six credits and success-
ful productions help to compen-
sate for the many hours spent in
the woefully inadequate drama
acility.

Total Theatre is nothing if not

ambitious, and this year’s pro-
gram is one of the most ambiti-
ous yet. The Troubadours will
present two major productions at
the end of the term, The Tempest
and Othello. The productions of
each play will be on alternating
nights in the last week. In addi-
tion, an adaptation of The Tem-
pest for children's theatre will be
performed at various schools in
the region,

Professor Lee Kahn is direct-
ing Othello, in which Paul Mor-
ella plays the lead role. The cast
also includes Brock Johnson as
Iago, Megan Morgan as Desde-
mona, Mary Ann Naber as Bian-

surprising that seniors have little interest in hearing every-

\ssociation to introduce senior class,

thing you always wanted to know about stencils, and we sus-
pect that the banquet would be more readily appreciated as a

gesture than as an appeal and indoctrination period, If the
seniors have taken the banquet less than seriously, this is

probably not completely their fault,

There really is not a praticularly strong reason for can-
celling the banquet rather than reforming it, unless, of course,
those people making the decision felt that the situation was
hopeless. We hope that efforts will be made to revive the
feel that it
offers a valuable opportunity for the seniors to gather as a

senior banquet by some group of people, as we
group for the last time before graduation,

This proposal originated with John Kelly Jennings of the
Department of Journalism and Communications,

Whereas there have been periodic protests at the apparent
wastefulness of the policy under which Washington and
Lee seniors are required to rent caps and gowns for a
couple of hours at graduation; and

Whereas the justification for that policy has been that (1)
an identity in costume helps erase personal distinctions
among men who are receiving a common degree, and
(2) the common costume reflects time-honored academ-
ic tradition:

This proposal would satisfy every concern, and would have
some additional advantages never before available to the uni-
versity and to the graduates. The costume would, of course,
continue to be identical (a referendum open to every degree
candidate could be held to choose among Porcelain butterfly,
Porcelain Medallion and Porcelain Garden, and the results of
the vote would be binding). Educational tradition would be
respected more than ever, graduates would resemble in
dress the statue of George Washington atop the Centre Build
ing, and what could possibly be more traditional at Washing-
ton and Lee than that? Instead of having to return the cos-
tume after commencement, graduates would have for al-
most exactly the same cost And

the university would receive $76.50 in royalties from the sale

Phi Food Editor
Lexington has everything to

offer the tourist, e.g., scenic land-
scapes, battlegrounds, historic
sites, and famous institutions. It
also has some pretty remarkable
restaurants which cannot be
categorized by anything other
than the fact that they are all in
Lexington and the food all tastes
very much alike. The hamlet does
not offer Continental cuisine or
any of the standard menus that
one would like to expect in a
place of such quiet elegance. In
fact, the only facility which
shows a single-minded concen-
tration on one type of food is
The China House. However, there
once was a parting glimpse of
gastronomic glory known as the
A.L.B. Corner Grill which de-
serves to be remembered here
post mortem.

If you have been wondering
why all the best people in Lex-
ington—Grit Man, Donkey Wo-
man, Skinny Doc, Ant Queen,
and all the others who make the
town social roster read like a
Who’s Who in American Rank-
ness and Dereliction — have been
in mourning for the past week, it
is a result of the untimely demise
of the Corner Grill, This brilli-
ant meeting place of the local
gentry and intelligensia has
closed its doors for the last time,
or so it would appear from the
looks of the main dining room.
Some stalwart hopefuls insist on
suggesting that The Corner Grill
has only been closed temporarily
for the staff and interior to re-

ceive a long-overdue grease and
lub job, and, truthfully, we had
noticed the slick of the kitchen
grill wearing thin in spots upon
out last visit to the fashionable
Lexington bistro.

The Corner Grill was always
proud of its preeminent position
on the culinary scene of the
Shenandoah Valley. Its patrons
and management used to call ita
“teaching” restaurant, as Wash-
ington and Lee is called a ‘‘teach-
ing” institution. The lovely pro-
prietress was often known to
grunt coquettishly to a newcom-
er who had just ordered his first
Corner Grill cheeseburger a la
mode, “That'll teach ya!” and,
of course, after spending six
hours worshipping at the porce-
lain altar the late, famous Saint
Martin of Tours, most people un-
derstood that which the Corner
Grill was trying to teach them,
i.e., don’t come back.

The Grill did have a great deal
in common with the fashionable
grills in London like the Savoy
Grill, especially in its Edwardian
styie of interior decoration. Al-
though the main dining room
features Classical indirect light-
ing and rich, English pine panel-
ing, there are elements here of
prehistoric Lexington and the
primitive era, ca.1900. A touch of
class was added to the stylish
chiseled fixtures of the Corner
Grill with its prints of Indian
braves taken trom Walt Disney's
comic book oi scenes from the
massacre of the holy innocents.
Naturally, most of the highly
sophisticated clientele chose to

Letter To The Editor

Law man tells his side

on closed party issue
To the Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

I wish to clarify for your read-
ers the circumstances surround-
ing the Law School's Nassau
Party on April 12, where two un-
dergraduate students were asked
by me to leave. I would like also
to assure the undergraduate stu-
dents that the incident was not
in pursuance to any organized ef-
fort to exclude undergraduates
from Law School parties gener-
ally.

The incident arose, I believe,
because of the special nature of
the Party, the way it was funded,
and the peculiarly irritating and
deceitful attitude of one of the
students toward me at the Party.
Moreover, like you, I cannot un-
derstand why any undergraduate
would want to come to Law
School parties in the first place
either; it's always more enjoy-
able to drive a car through a
building, intimidate the band, or
intentionally destroy the electri-
cal system, as was done by one of
your number at our Christmas
party last December. In addition
to boring, Law School parties are
unfortunately poorly funded.
These drawbacks influenced the
Social Committee of the Law
School to make this party closed
to all but those law students,
staff and faculty who bought tic-
kets. Let me make clear to you
that if a law student did not buy
a ticket, he or she would also
have been asked to leave. Each
ticket-purchaser paid $5.00 per
couple for admittance, which en-

titled him or her to a chance to
win a trip to Nassau or about 75
other prizes donated by local
merchants. We wanted to sell
such tickets only to law students
to insure that they receive these
presents. We felt that whatever
excitement the whole thing gen-
erated would have been lost if
nobody knew who the winners
were.

Second, we simply cannot af-
ford to buy liquor for the entire
student body. The Nassau Party
is “open bar” and liquor was
bought to accommodate only
about 350 people; this alone cost
over $450, and we could not af-
ford to plan an open bar party
for even 20 more people, much
less 1200. I understand that the
students had brought their own,
and that they probably used only
that; but if it were largely known
that this one party were open,
less discreet drinkers would take
advantage, Where our parties are
BYO, neither I nor any law stu-
dent has any objection to under-
graduates’ coming. Such was the
case at our Christmas party, and
any of our other parties.

As I understand it, you have
“closed” parties from time to
time, occasioned probably by rea-
sons not unlike those I've tried to
outline here. I therefore hope
that at least some undergradu-
ates understand why ours had to
be this one time.

Some undergraduate students
were in fact present at the Party,

that occurred, and why the two

DEAR TRAVELLER—I am just sick to death of all the crumby in-
tra-mural offerings here at Washington and Lee When will those
blockheads in charge of the program get on the stick and come up
with something fun to do? Please light a fire under these people
and give them a few of your intelligent suggestions for improv-
ing the intra-mural program.

(Signed) Lady Treece

DEAR TREECE—Granted, intra-murals at W&L are not the most
exciting thing on two knees in this or any other season. However,
much could be done to make the program more interesting and
relevant for the student body. The best way to add new life in
this area is to add new and challenging sports in which students
may participate. Some of the sports which might be included are:

-—-Whips and Chains. The University should willingly provide
instruments of torture/pleasure for those students who get their
thrills in somewhat kinky ways. Students would be allowed to pair
up into sado-masochism teams, and the sadist drawing the most
blood at ten feet with either the whip or the chain would win the
trophy for his fraternity. Wouldn't that be a nice trophy to dis-
play in he house on Parents’ Weekend?

—Fun with Leather. The Art Department should sponsor this
sport in which there would be a timed competition to determine
who can tool the fastest in leather and who can weave the big-
gest straw basket.

—Oregy. This contest would give all the houses a chance to
prove their endurance in comparison to other houses. Of course,
the competition would be closed to all girls except the mesdames
from Southern Sem. Each fraternity could be given a roped-off
section of Wilson Field, and the group which was able to sustain
its activity without brake for the longest period of time would
win the special prize — free tickets to see “The Life and Times of
Xaxiera Hollander.”

—Program Competition. Each player would be handed one

Defending champion Hampton
Institute is an
favorite to repeat,
Washington and Lee will be a
strong contender in the Virginia
College Athletic Association
(VCAA) tennis championships
here this weekend.

The Hampton collegians swept
all nine places last year and
boast one of the best college ten-
nis teams in the country.

Washington and Lee’s dual

meet record now stands at 12-6 f

following receent meets with
Virginia Tech (won 5-4), Navy
(lost 8-1), George Washington
(won 6-3), William and Mary
(won 6-3), and Richmond (lost
7-2).

Washington and Lee won six
events but dropped a 90-55 deci-
sion in track last week to Lynch-
bure College. Winning for the
Generals were Tony Perry with a
6-4 high jump, Paul Thomson in
the mile (4:31.1), Steve Schwei-
zerhof with a 42-foot shot put,
Barclay Armstrong with a 21-6
long jump, John Tucker with a

52.0 in the 440-yard dash, and
Tem Washington with a 15:59.1
in the three-mile run,

The Generals also competed
last week in the Virginia State
Meet, where the 440-yard relay
team placed fifth with a :44.2
clocking, Schweizerhof was fifth
in the shot with a 43-2 heave,
and Thomson was sixth in the
mile with a 4:19.7 time, just a
tenth of a second off his school
record,

Washington and Lee's baseball
team played perhaps its best
same of tne year last Sunday be-
jore a large crowd which includ-
ed NBC sportscaster Joe Gara-
giola, who was doing a documen-
tary on college baseball. The
Generals lost a 1-0 heartbreaker
in the first game of a double-
header, filmed by NBC Sports
camera crew, and also dropped

the second game, 13-8, to Old
Dominion.
The NBC feature on college

baseball, which will include some
of the W&L-ODU game, is tenta-
tively scheduled to be aired June

9 on Garagiola’s “Baseball
World” series preceding the
Monday night Game-of-the-
Week.

The double loss to ODU, coupl-
ed with an 11-1 setback to Madi-
son earlier, left the Generals with
a 2-16 season mark. The Gen-
erals will have a chance at re-
venge Tuesday when they travel
to Madison, and will be host to
undefeated Lynchburg College on
Friday, beginning at 3:00 p.m.
on W&L's Smith Field.

in the NCAA lacrosse champion-

The fun, if one could call it
that, ended this past weekend as
W&L dropped a 14-9 exhibition
to powerful Maryland Lacrosse
Club on Saturday, then waltzed
past North Carolina State’s in-
experienced Wolfpack, 19-4, the
following afternoon.

The Generals played at North
Carolina yesterday in a game
that could have ended the Tar

tion.

It could have done

Back on March 1 three-time
All-American Ted Bauer scored
three goals to lead the Chesa-
peake L.C. to a 14-10 exhibition
win over the Generals.

Saturday it was John Lalley,
one of Bauer's running mates at
midfield last year, who got the
hat trick to lead Maryland L.cC.
to its 14-9 win in another exhibi-
tion.

Lalley, himself a recipient of
All-American mention in 1972,
scored one of four straight goals
that gave MLC a 4-1 lead.

W&L twice came back to with-
in a goal, but never regained the
lead. While the Generals con-
trolled the game statistically
with big edges in shots, ground
balls, and faceoffs, they never
quite solved MLC goalie Ed Stu-

several of the spectacular

W&L’s attack trio of Rob Mor-
gan, Don Carroll, and Dave War-
field did almost all of the Gen-
erals’ scoring. Morgan had four
goals and an assist, Carroll con-
tributed three goals, and War-
field added a goal and four as-
sists. Ken Miller got the other
W&L goal.

What proved to be the Gen-
erals’ downfall was an inability
to cash in on extra man situa-
tions. W&L scored on only one of
eleven extra-man opportunities,
while MLC cashed in three of six
times.

W&L's scoring slump continu-

Carolina State, even though the
fact of 19 Generals’ goals
wouldn't indicate that to be the
case,

More often than not W&L at-
tackmen and midfielders were
beating their defenders with a
variety of moves and fakes, but
when it came time to shoot the
ball would go wide, hit a pipe, or
not go at all.

Of 76 total shots, 19 found the
back of the net for W&L goals,
another 25 were credited as ‘‘sav-
ed by goalies’’ and the rest were
of the “close but...” type.

Again the attackmen did most
of the scoring. Warfield had four
goals, Morgan added three, while
Carroll, Boyd Martin, and Jim
Englehart each had a pair of
goals.

Freshman midfielders Brian
Tray and Mark Derbyshire each
had two goals, while classmates
Scott Baugher and Jay Sindler
scored one apiece.

The highlight of an otherwise
average game was the Generals
surviving a situation in which
four players were serving penal-
ties, including goalie Malcolm
Hastings,

Freshman Charlie Brown, who
has been seeing time at midfield
in recent games, returned to the
goal in the penalty situation,
stopped State’s lone shot, and
then ran out the time on two of
of the penalties.

It made things exciting on an
otherwise ho-hum afternoon.

DEAR TRAVELLER — I recall reading in some magazine in the au-

number of gray squirrels (L. graius sciurus). What happened to
them all — I wanted to invite them as featured guests at a bio-
logy seminar this spring?

DEAR EMMONS — Fear not, the furry little woodland creatures
have not left the historic back campus permanently; they have
temporarily moved across Wood's Creek and have been signed up
as construction workers in the apartment complex, where they
carry nails and steel beams way up to the workmen on the second

(That's a pretty big family.)

But that's what the
Salesians of St. John Bosco
are all about — a large family
of community-minded men
dedicated to the service of *
youth. (And no one gets lost.)

In Italy in the 1800's a chance meeting between a poor
priest and a street urchin served to create a movement of such
success that it is still growing today. Don Bosco became the
priest who brought youth back from the streets — and
back to God.

He reasoned that a program of play, learn and pray would
make useful citizens of the world. He crowded out evil with
reason, religion and kindness in a (what was then unheard of)
atmosphere of family.

The ideals of St. John Bosco are still with us today. His
work goes on in boys clubs, technical and academic schools
guidance centers, summer camps and missions. And his very
human approach is very evident in the family spirit of the
Salesians. This is the way he wanted it. This is the way it is.
The Salesian experience isn't learned — it's lived,

Many lecturers here this week

(Continued from page 1)
next week as participants in a
professional institute on medical
ethics.

The institute is scheduled in
conjunction with a course in
medical ethics inquiring into the
difficult decisions physicians are
called on to make regarding
abortion, death and dying pati-
ents, experimentation on hu-
mans, genetic manipulation, and
even “health as a human right.”

During the three-day institute,
the physicians wil work with stu-
dents enrolled in the course both
in and out of formal classroom
settings. Six seminars have been
scheduled during the three days
to enable both students and doc-

Two plays in rehearsal

will be made in the set to give
the whole a lighter, more whim-
sical atmosphere than will be the
case for the production of Ot-
hello, John Hollinger will play
Ferdinand while Mary Ann Na-
ber plays Miranda with Dave
DeChristopher as Prospero,
Brock Johnson as Alonzo, Paul
Richards as Caliban, with Don
Hogle as Ariel, and sixteen mem-
bers of the spring company will
assume roles for the production.
Mr. DeChristopher will provide
an adaptation of The Tempest
for presentation as children’s
theatre in 10 - 12 performances
at schools from Roanoke to
Brownsburg. This play will run
45 minutes, and will include
much the same cast employed in
the Shakespeare play.

Total Theatre enjoys a seven-
teen person company which in-
cludes two females this year. All
members of the company are
either actors in the plays or as-
sistants in other fields of produc-
tion. Thus, in its fifth year Total
Theatre is still working ardu-
ously within the severe limita-
tions which it faces at Washing-
ton and Lee and doing a remark-
ably good job as an educational
theatre,

tors “to wrestle, through the case
method, pressing issues confront-
ing the medical profession.”

Dr. Irving S. Cooper, neuro-
surgeon at St. Barnabas Hospi-
tal in New York, will deliver a
public lecture and direct three of
the seminars. Other seminars
will be conducted by Dr. Louis W.
Hodges, professor of religion at
W&L and director of the univer-
sity’s pre-professional ethics pro-
grams, which include journalism
and law in addition to medicine.

Richard D. Obenshain, Co-
Chairman of the Republican Na-
tional Committee, will speak on
Tuesday, April 29, The speech
will take place in room 114 of the
Student Center, and will start at
8 p.m. Obenshain’s address is be-
ing sponsored by the W&L Re-
publicans and is open to the pub-
lic. His speech will deal with the
problems and dangers inherent
in big government and the stance
of the Republican Party on the
topic.

On ‘Thursday, May 1, the
Young Americans for Freedom
will sponsor a speech by M. Stan-
ton Evans, journalist and author,
in Lee Chapel at 8 p.m.

A one-man exhibition of art by
a Lexington senior at W&L will
take place April 28 through May
4 in the university's duPont Gal-
lery.

The show will feature the work
of Anthony M. Murray, who will
be graduated next month from
W&L wiih a major in art. Murray
is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Waltcr
N. Murray ot Lexington.

The public is invited to view
the show — the first in a series
of four week-long exhibitions by
W&L art majors this spring —
weekdays from 8 to 4, There is
no charge.

Next Wednesday and Thurs-
day, a British art historian and
staff member of the Victoria and
Albert Museum, Helen Lowen-
thal, will deliver lectures in du-
Pont Auditorium. The Wednes-
day lecture, “Fantastics in Euro-
pean Gardens,” begins at 7 p.m,

were asked to leave. Those pre-
sent either had a law student
buy a ticket for them in the law
student's name ‘unbeknownst to
the ticket-sellers), or otherwise
obtained a ticket. The two stu-
dents involved had no ticket and
ignored my requests at the door
to produce one. When one of the
two came back some time later to
explain to me why he ought to
stay, I told him why the party
was closed and asked him to
leave; he got upset and, among
others, threatened to leave. About
an hour later, I found him at the
bar again and asked him to leave.
For the manner I acted on that
occasion I apologize, as I did to
him and his date as they left.
Before he left, though, he tried
to steal a bottle of Jack Daniels
on the prize table at the door,
and two law students are pre-
pared to identify the student,
should that be necessary. Perhaps
had I been less hassled and more
perfectly sober, the incident may
-_

 

not have arisen. In any event,
those events surrounding this
particular individual caused his
being asked to leave; I was un-
able to fashion a more rational
approach to him under the cir-
cumstances. That is my fault,
and not a Law School policy to-
ward undergraduates generally.

I am sorry that the incident
has grown to the stature requir-
ing your editorial comment, I
hope the undergraduate students
can understand why this Party
was closed. We are faced together
with a rather bleak social en-
vironment in Lexington, and it
would be worse an atmosphere if
we two social lions turned on
each other. We certainly do not
want to have this incident force
the communication gap between
us any wider than it evidently
has become.

Sincerely,

Grady C. Frank

Law School

Mayor proclaims ROTC Week

Lexington Mayor Charles F.
Phillips, Jr., has proclaimed
April 21 through 27 ROTC Week
in Lexington.

“In so doing I am endorsing
the action of Virginia Governor
Mills E. Godwin, Jr. who pre-
viously declared the week of
April 21 to 27 to be ROTC Week
in Virginia,” declared Mayor
Phillips.

Governor Godwin’'s proclama-
tion recognized that ROTC “gra-
duates of the program have prov-
ed themselves again and again
in defense of the nation.”

The city of Lexington is some-
what fortunate to have two maj-
or universities, W&L and V.M.I.,

both of which offer ROTC pro-
grams,

For Army ROTC particularly,
this proclamation of ROTC
Week is very timely, coming on
the heels of April 19, the two
hundredth anniversary of the
“shot heard round the world”
and arriving in 1975, the Army’s
bicentennial year.

NOTICE

Petitions for candidacy for the
University Council are due in the
E.C, room by 7 p.m. Monday
night, April 28. All candidates
should be at the E.C. meeting at
that time. Petitions must be
signed by 50 students.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, MAY 1, 1975

Candidates for UC announced, relations

with Lexington discussed at EC meeting

By JOE FITZGERALD
‘The Phi News Staff

Two juniors, two sophomores,
and six freshmen announced
their candidacy for next year’s
University Council at the Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting Mon-
day night.

The rising seniors seeking seats
on the council are Keith Crocker
and Seott Stevenson. The class
is allotted three seats on that
body.

The rising juniors running for
the U.C. are Woody Woodell and
Ken Voelker. Sophomore candi-
dates include George Griffin,
Doug Jackson, John Wheatley,
David Low, Steve Marzo, and
Howard Rubel.

The elections will be held on
Monday, May 5, with run-offs
on the following Thursday if
necessary.

The candidates will be limited
to 25 posters. Upperclass candi-
dates may not put posters in the
dorms and Commons, while
freshmen are restricted to these
two locations. Candidates may
spend only $5 during the cam-
paign preceding the general
election and only $2.50 between
then and the run-off. Unlimted
spending was proposed but voted
down by the E.C.

Executive Committee Presi-
dent-elect Leland McCullough
announced plans Monday night
for a seminar the week of May 12
to discuss University-Community
or “Town-Gown” relations.

event will be W&L President
Huntley and Lexington Mayor
Charles Phillips. The speeches
will be followed by meetings of
student leaders and school ad-
ministrators with town officials,
cultural leaders, merchants and
W&L alumni from Lexington.

Possibie topics for discussion
include police activity and park-
ing regulations, the city tax, stu-
dent misconduct, check-cashing
policies and problems, benefits of
the university and the town for
each other, the financial need
of the school, ways to improve
relations between the town and
the school, and athletic events.

Thes problems will be discuss-
ed by three groups of students,
administrators and local resi-
dents, Each group will number
15 people.

In other business, the E.C.
members present at the meeting
agreed to contribute ten dollars
toward the publication of a la-
crosse yearbook to supplement
the programs now being handed
out at the games.

The members donated the
money out of their own pockets
to avoid further depleting their
beleaguered treasury.

In other business, next year’s
E.C. appointed Terry Atwood and
Clark Thompson co-chairman of
the Student Activities Board for
next year.

The meeting began with a dis-
cussion of whether a _ student
would be allowed to sit in on
the interviews of prospective
chairmen.

The new E.C. at first agreed

 

    

  
   
  
    
 
  
  

with special attention to the

here, 1 p.m,

College, away.

Bos ee geen tenga amg

that it was E.C. policy to open
interviews to the student body
but to hold executive sessions
when it came time for discussion
of the applicants. Later Scott
Franklin brought up the fact
that personalities were likely to
be discussed by the applicants
and this should not be open to
the student body,

The issue was resolved for the
present when the student in ques-
tion left the meeting. The E.C.
is still not sure about the mean-
ing of an amendment that says
they can only hold executive
sessions for discussions of mat-
ters of honor. According to Bob
Pugh, the E.C. has “managed to
get around” the amendment so
far.

Also, at a meeting last week,
the new E.C. appointed Bill Kerr
head of the Voting Regulations

Board for next year and renamed
David Braun chairman of the
Recruitment Committee.

This reporter would like to
apologize to the chairman and
members of the Curriculum Com-
mittee for accidental maligning
of certain persons as a result
of a misunderstanding over Mr.
Lyles’ remarks during the April
21 Executive Commiitee meet-
ing. The story stated that “Lyles
reported that the ‘shitty re-
sponse’ as he described it was
due to members of his commit-
tee not doing their jobs as far
as collecting he form” for the
winter term curriculum survey.
But according to Lyles, only
about 100 of 1500 missing forms
could be blamed on his commit-
tee, while the rest could be traced
to “faculty confusion,” or lack
of cooperation by several faculty
members.

Liberty Hall linen to be
used in White House

“Porcelain Butterfly,” one of
three linen designs manufactur-
ed by Wamsutta Mills and de-
rived from Washington and Lee
University’s Reeves Collection of
Chinese Export porcelain, has
been selected for ceremonial use
at the White House.

The bright-blue-on-white pat-
tern was used to make table
linens for a luncheon to be given
May 5 by Mrs. Gerald R. Ford
in honor of the U.S. Senate wives.

The three porcelain-inspired
designs—“Garden” and ‘‘Medal-
lion” in addition to “Butterfly’—
are marketed by Wamsutta as
the “Liberty Hall Collection,”
taking the name of W&L’s Revo-
lutionary War-era predecessor
institution. That name was a-
dopted by trustees of the little
valley school May 13, 1776, as
an official endorsement of in-
dependence from England.

Washington and Lee receives
a royalty for its educational bud-
get from each item sold by
Wamsutta in the Liberty Hall
Collection.

Each of the designs was taken
from pieces of late 18th-century
porcelain, part of W&L’s 2,000-
piece Reeves Collection, be-
queathed to the university in 1967
by Mr. and Mrs. Euchlin D.
Reeves of Providence, R.I.

The butterfly pattern is adapt-
ed from a design on the edge of
an octagonal platter made about
1785. The plate. similar to an-
other in the Reeves Collection
that was owned by George Wash-
ington, is of the Fitzhugh de-
sign. and butterflies were used
to “turn” the corners

Wamsutta designer Peter Neal
used other details from the same

platter elsewhere in the Liberty
Hall Collection. The porcelain
Medallion pattern, as an example,
combines a scallop on the platter
with a floral design on a por-
celain service believed to have
been owned by Paul Revere and
how a part of the Reeves Col-
lection.

WeL calendar compared with
schedules at other universities

By the Phi News Staff

Next year classes begin on
September 10, and spring term
exams end on May 31. On the
proposed calendar for the com-
ing years, examinations end as
late at June 4 ‘in the proposed
calendar year for 1978-79). As
W&L men seem to spend longer
and longer periods of time on
vacation, thus lengthening the
academic year, we thought it
would be interesting to compare
calendars with several other
schools in the region.

At W&L next year, classes begin
on September 10 for the twelve-
week long Fall Term. With a
five day break for Thanksgiving.
the University closes for Christ-
mas on December 12. Classes re-
sume on January 5 for the sec-
ond twelve-week stretch, and
with a nine day break in Febru-
ary (Known as Washington Holi-
day’. exams are not finished
until April 9.

After another nine day breath-

er, the six week term begins on
April 19. And final examinations
are completed on May 31.

So for W&L. which operates
a 12-12-6 calendar, there is a
total of 46 days of vacation in-
jected into the full academic
year.

which operates on a 12-4-12 sys-
tem? Like us, the women at that
institution begin classes on Sep-
tember 10. They have a nine day
Fall Break in late October, a
four day Thanksgiving Break,
and leave for Christmas on De-
cember 18.

They return on January 5 for
their four week short term. and
after a five day break in Febru-

ary, begin the second full se-
mester. A ten day vacation in
late March allows for spring

frolics in the sun. and the girls
work until May 18, the last day
of exams

Mary Baldwin Collece’s aca-
demic calendar is similar in most
respects to that of Hollins. In-
stead of a separate break in the
fall. Baldwin girls get a full
week's vacation at Thanksgiving,
and have an identical Christmas
Holiday. They also have a short
term. followed by a slight break
and then a twelve-week term in-
terrupted by a Spring Break in
late March: the college ends its

examination period on May 13.

The University of Virginia is
on a similar schedule. Classes in
Charlottesville begin on Septem-
ber 5, and with only two days off
at Thanksgiving, examinations
are dispensed with by December
19. Regular classes resume on
January 13, and with a week's
vacation in the spring. the sec-
ong term, which is one week
longer than the first, ends by
May 10.

The College of William and
Mary is planning to institute a
new academic calendar for the
coming year. While the semester
system will be retained, in a con-
densed thirteen and a half week
format, exams will be offered be-
fore Christmas and in the begin-
ning of May. Like most other
colleges. W&M will have a spring
break in mid-March.

What conclusions can be
drawn from comparing W&é&L’'s
ealendar with those of other uni-
versities and colleges? Not much
in the way of concrete compari-

sons can be drawn, but most
other campuses are operating
with a shorter academic year,

usually with twenty-four to
twenty-seven weeks of classes,
compared to thirty at W&L. Then
again, can be argued that stu-
denis at W&L are receiving more
for their dollars spent in tuition.

[REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

The proposed calendar

After seeing a copy of the tentative five-year calendar

proposed for the University (see related article, page one), we
are distressed, Next year spring term examinations end on

May 31, the following year on May 30, then on May 29, and
in 1979 on June 4.

With the increase of Washington Holiday to a full week’s
break in February, in addition to the normal Spring Break
in April, the acedemic year has become so long that in coming
years students will still be studying in the library during the
first days of June.

Admittedly, it is nice to be able to take a week’s vacation
in the doldrums of the winter months, but when such an
extension of recesses forces the encroachment of scheduled
classes into the summer months, perhaps some reconsidera-
tion should be made.

Is a full week of vacation really necessary in the middle
of the winter term? Students seem to manage without one
in the first term, Should the break be continued at its planned
length if it poses too much of a hardship on those students
who are obligated by their finances to seek summer employ-
ment? The extension of the calendar beyond Memorial Day
puts W&L students at a severe disadvantage in the summer
job market, where they must compete with students from
other schools who finish before the end of May.

We feel that the University Council and the faculty should
review its proposed calendar carefully, and consider all the
ramifications of requiring the students of W&L to remain on
campus for such a long time in the late spring because of too
much vacation in the early spring. Perhaps even a referendum
of sorts could be organized, and all students could express
their opinion in the matter by voting for or against the ex-
tended Washington Holiday,

Students and concerts

We would like to thank the members of the W&L stu-
dent body, their dates and friends, and anyone else who
attended the Four Tops concert this past Friday night—they
helped to make possible one of the more successful concerts
in several years.

The Student Activities Board has been plagued by poor
attendance at many of the concerts it has organized for the
students in Lexington over the past few years, At the an-
nouncement of each, various groups of students with musical
tastes could
be heard complaining about the lack of concerts that would

not expressly served by the given concert

satisfy their own tastes.

\nd so attendance has lagged at nearly every scheduled
concert. The SAB, in attempting to satisfy the majority of
the students, has evidently been able to appeal only to musical
minorities.

Friday night's concert appeared to show a change of heart
on both sides. SAB scheduled three bands (if the first could
be called a performing group), each of which had appeal to
different musical tastes. And the student body supported the
effort, attending in numbers sufficient enough to enable the
SAB to break even.

The relative success of the concert might encourage the
SAB to schedule more and better concerts next year. For only
with the support of most of the students can the Board
continue to attempt to bring performers of some quality to
Washington and Lee.

By DAVID URANO

Fraternities are an age-old
institution at W&L and like all
institutions, they have had their
ups and downs. Several uppers
and downers have been swallow-
ed in the past 10 years.

Ten years ago between 80 and
85 per cent of the undergraduates
were members of fraternities.
Way back then, frats were very
important to a student’s social
life. David Braun, Rush Chair-
man for the  Interfraternity
Council, said that all frat parties
were closed with the exception
of Homecoming weekend and
Springs weekend.

Fraternities adhered to string-
ent rules a decade ago. For ex-
ample, girls, women if you prefer,
were not allowed above the first
floor—probably because there
were beds on the second and
third floors. As a result, many
of the Greeks resorted to “make
out rooms,” according to Braun—
those smart fraternity men figur-
ed out that a couch was as good
as a bed.

The 15 or 20 per cent of the
students on campus who were
independents were not left off
of the couch as it were. Two
independent organizations were
formed, the Gaines Society for
the socially inclined and the
Independent Union for the
athletically inclined. The Inde-
pendent Union leaned towards
intramurals and contact sports
while the Gaines Society sponsor-
ed parties and contact sports.

Alas, social fraternities became
more liberal with open parties
and an addition to the Student
Union including the Cockpit, TV
rooms and a pinball room put a

damper on the Gaines Society's
activities. Besides, independents
were independents because they
wanted to be independent and
they didn't want organized func-
tions; so, because of a lack of
support, the Gaines Society fiz-
zeled out four or five years ago
and hasn't been heard from since.

In early 1970, the market
crashed. Delta Upsilon, Kappa
Sigma and Kappa Alpha were no
more and the percentage of
undergrads in frats fell as low
as 55 per cent,

Several houses ran into trouble,
financially and memershipwise.
In 1970, Sigma Phi Epsilon drop-
ped from 50 members to three
because the upperclassmen be-
came perturbed at the under-
classmen and, in classic W&L
form, bagged it. In the fall term
of 1973, Zeta Beta Tau was al-
most closed by the trustees be-
cause of financial difficulties.

These situations are looking up
now, however. According to Den-
nis Oakley, SPE president, there
are now 25 members in the SPE
house. Ricky Lovegrove, a ZBT
sophomore, said that his house
has 32 members now and is
breaking even financially.

Last year, five black students
organized Alpha Phi Alpha, and
nobody has heard from or about
them since. They have not been
attending IFC meetings and
therefore are not recognized as
a fraternity by the IFC, said
Dean John. According to Braun,
Alpha Phi Alpha is going to try
to rush next year.

The 1974-75 academic year is
proving to be a busy one in the
fraternity world.

In the fall term, W&L lost a

your one and only Spring Term course because of too many
road trips and other vitally important stuff, like drinking beer
at Goshen and trying very hard to kill yourself at Twin Falls?

(Signed) Real Slim

DEAR SLIM—The only possible solution of your problem is to
practice the fine art of brown-nosing your professor. It he's
a bachelor and under 50 ‘in mind, not body) the best thing
to do is offer to get him a date. Your grade in the course
will then be dependent on how good-looking she ‘or he) is,

and how far he got with

her (or
complimenting him on his new

him). You can also try
ratty looking sport jackets,

and raising your hand a lot in class and hoping he doesn't
call on you. (This also helps you keep awake in class.) Staying
after class and explaining to him how you can't make out his
handwriting on the blackboard always helps to show your
serious approach to the subject.

One of the most dependable techniques to get on the good

side of your professoi

Lacrosse Generals still hope to gain playoff slot

By BILL FLESHER

Whatever Washington and
Lee’s lacrosse Generals did to get
Lady Luck back on their side,
it happened just in the nick of
time to avert an end to any post
season hopes.

After losing three games by a
one-goal margin, including a 13-
12 sudden death setback at the
hands of North Carolina on
Wednesday, W&L turned the
tables Saturday, as freshman
midfielder Scott Baugher scored
his only goal of the game with
five seconds left to give the Gen-
erals a 15-14 win over Towson
State, the nation’s top-ranked
college division team.

Sports

Now boasting a 10-1 season
record, Washington and Lee’s
golf team will close out the sea-
son this week with home matches
against three opponents.

Coach Buck Leslie's Generals
will entertain Emory & Henry
and Madison Friday, beginning
at 1:00 p.m., and be host to
Gettysburg next Monday (May
5) at 1:00 p.m., both at the Lex-
ington Golf and Country Club.

The Generals have been idle
since finishing third in the Vir-
ginia College Athletic Associa-
tion meet on April 21.

Freshman Ray Scott recorded
four first-place finishes to lead
Washington and Lee University
to a 103-41 track victory over
Roanoke College last week, up-
ping the Generals’ season rec-
ord to 3-4.

Scott posted his best times of
the year in winning the 100-yard
dash in 9.9 and 220 in :22.6. He
also ran legs on the winning
440- and mile-relay teams.

John Tucker of Lexington ran
on both winning relay teams and
won the 440-yard dash with a
:51.5 clocking.

Over the weekend, W&L shot-
putter Steve Schweizerhof broke
the Virginia College Athletic
Association record by almost
three feet, winning the event with
a toss of 46-3 feet. W&L tied
for fifth place in the VCAA
meet.

Coach Norris Aldridge’s track
team will be host to Bridgewater
Friday in a meet beginning at
3:00 p.m. at Wilson Field.

 

Washington and Lee’s baseball
wame with VMI was rained out
Tuesday and has been reschedul-
ed for Thursday at 3:00 p.m. at
Smith Field. The Generals’ rec-
ord slipped to 2-17 after a 4-2
setback at Madison last week.

After VMI, W&L’s next appear-
ance will be a double-header
Friday against Newport News
Apprentice, beginning at 1:00
p.m. on Smith Field,

The win revived the Generals’
hopes for a fourth straight trip
to the National Collegiate Athle-
tic Association (NCAA) Lacrosse
Championship Tournament,
hopes that would have been
greatly dimmed by a loss to the
Tigers,

It was a week full of thrills,
spills, and chills, but most of
all, it was a week in which two
superb lacrosse games were play-
ed. One could write on them for
several pages; we'll try to hold
it down a bit.

The week in review:

North Carolina’s 5-7 record
entering their game with W&L
was unimpressive enough to hint
an easy Generals’ win until one

looked at which teams made up
the seven.

The Tar Heels’ losses had come
at the hands of Maryland (13-9),
Princeton (12-11), Navy (11-4),
Towson State (12-7), UMBC (12-
9), Virginia (10-6), and Wash-
ington College (12-9).

After seven close losses to
teams of that caliber, it would
seem that UNC was due for a
big game, right?

So who would they happen to
have their big game against?

It’s not that the Generals
didn’t have their chances to win
the game, which lasted four reg-
ulation, two overtime, and two-
and-a-half sudden death periods
—over 78 minutes in all,

 

But it was the Tar Heels who
took advantage of that one break
to score the winning goal. Fresh-
man midfielder Paul Worstell
picked up a loose ball at mid-
field, carried the ball through
two W&L defenders, and fired a
bounce shot past goalie Malcolm
Hastings for the game-winner at
10:06 of sudden death.

The game had been a nip-and-
tuck affair throughout regula-
tion play, with neither team
holding more than a_ two-goal
lead.

The score was deadlocked at
the end of all four periods at
2-2, 5-5 at intermission, 9-9, and
11-11 after four quarters.

first goal in overtime off a Dave
Warfield feed to put W&L up
12-11. The Generals held that
lead throughout the overtime
periods until North Carolina’s
Peter Miller tallied with 1:23 left
to knot the score again.

Both teams had several op-
portunities for winning goals in
the early minutes of sudden
death, but NC goalie Chuck
Weinstein and W&L’s Hastings
came up with key saves to keep
the game going.

But then Worstell, held in
check throughout the game, came
up with the big play to hand
W&L its second sudden death loss
of the year.

All-American Bert Fett, stop-
ped cold in even-up situations by
W&L’'s Bob Lindsey, got three
extra-men goals to lead the Tar
Heels’ scoring.

Miller, Charlie Brown, Chris
Larson, and Don Carroll each
had two goals for the Generals,
while Dave Warfield added a
goal and four assists.

It was obvious what the Tow-
son State game meant to the
Generals after the North Caro-
lina loss. Another loss and the
players could count on studying
for exams rather than play in
the NCAA tournament in late
May. A win, however, would put
them back in the race.

For the Tigers, the nation’s
number one college division team,
the game provided a chance to
further solidify their hold on the
top spot, with a 15-12 win over
Virginia earlier in the week under
their belt.

And it was a grudge match
with the only team to beat the
Tigers (19-17 in overtime) in
1974.

Like the W&L-Towson games
of 1973 (‘a 13-12 General win)
and 1974, this one was another
free-wheeling, high-scoring
affair.

And, though it was midfielder
Scott Baugher who got the game-
winning goal, it was the Gen-
erals’ attack trio which made the

difference.

Senior Dave Warfield and
juniors Don Rob Morgan and
Don Carroll combined for 13
goals and nine assists. Warfield,
fully recovered from his early-
season knee injury, had seven
goals and four assists. Morgan
went four and three, Carroll,
two and two.

Meanwhile the Tigers’ attack
unit, the source of 18 points
(goals and assists) a game, was
stymied by another superb effort
by W&L defensemen Lindsey,
Tom Keigler, and John Strock.

Lindsey stopped high-scoring
attackman Wayne Eisenhut at
two goals, while the Tigers’ Bob
Griebe managed only two assists
against Keigler.

After Towson State jumped out
to a 3-1 first quarter lead, the
Generals quickly got on track
with five of the next six goals
to go ahead 6-4. But the Tigers,
who may be the most explosive
team in college lacrosse today,
duplicated the feat in the final
four minutes of the half to gain
move ahead 9-7.

The third quarter belonged to
W&L. Warfield scored goals
three, four, and five to go with
Carroll's second to boost the
Generals to an 11-10 third quart-
er lead.

But the Tigers again exploded,
this time for four of the next five
goals to regain the lead at 14-12
with 8:32 left.

Warfield then scored twice,
once on a feed from defenseman

spring of 1970. Braun said that
the KA National has granted the
11 member organization a pro-
visional charter and KA will be-
come a regular chapter when
they scrounge up four additional
members. Dean John said that
the KA members are arranging
with Psi U officials to lease the
defunct Psi U’s house for next
year.

Some other houses are becom-
ing increasingly disenchanted
with their National Fraternities
because they feel that they are
not getting enough benefits from
them, for all the money they
shovel in, to make the affilia-
tion worth anybody's while. (Ex-

that there is a resurgence in fra-
ternities because frats have fewer
reguiations governing them than
in recent memory. This year,
about 68 per cent of the fresh-
men pledged various houses and
of the undergrads, about 60 per
cent are members. Dean John
thinks that fraternity member-
ship will plateau at 60-65 per
cent of the student body. He
believes that this is an improve-
ment of 10 years ago because
freshmen will have a chance to
see and decide for themselves
which is better: fraternity life or
independent life.

Grade inflation:
is it at a standstill?

By STEVE YEVICH
Phi Feature Editor

Preliminary results indicate
that the much-proclaimed phe-
nomenon of “grade inflation”
has slowed even more on the W&L
campus than the figures for fall
term indicate.

The Ring-tum Phi staff has
compiled its own departmental
grade point ratios (GPR) for
thirty-five departments and dis-
ciplines. By these compilations,
twenty departments showed gains
in their GPR, fourteen register-
ed declines, and one remained
stable.

Departments which showed
significant increases in GPR
from the winter term of 1974 to
that of 1975 were Chinese and
Russian. The GPR for Chinese
rose by .667 to 3.333. The Rus-
sion department average rose
.510 to 3.125. (These figures were
computed only from grades of
A, B, C, D, E, and F. Incom-
pletes and passing grades were
not counted.) These two disci-
plines have two of the highest
¥PR's on campus.

Those departments registering
significant declines in GPR in-
clude Spanish, dropping .483 to
2.731, Greek, down .667 to 2.923,
and courses in computer science,
which declined .458 to 2.37.
Computer science, by these un-
official figures, has one of the
lowest GPR’s in the university,
with only the English depart-
ment lowker on the scale.

Other departments which ex-
perienced increases in their GPR
were: Military science, up .273
to 3.506, the highest rating on
campus; German, up .268; pub-
lic speaking, up .130; mathe-
matics, up .147; administration,
up .173; psychology, up .160;
philosophy, up .125; accounting,
up .131; and religion, up .121.

Disciplines which registered
only modest gains of less than
.100 include drama, music, com-
parative literture, art, engineer-
ing, physics, geology, anthro-
pology, and economics.

Departments experiencing
minor declines for the winter
term include Latin, biology, his-

They've got a long way to
go. In a world that isn't easy.
But with someone's help,
they'll make it. What they need
is a friend. Someone to act as
confidant and guide. Perhaps,
it could be you as a Salesian
Priest or Brother.

The Salesians of St. John
Bosco were founded in 1859 to

 

tory, journalism, sociology and
politics. French, classics, chem-
istry, Italian, and English posted
moderate declines of between .100
and .400.

The one discipline to have a
stable GPR is Inderdepartmental,
constant at a perfect 3.0.

The ten departments or dis-
ciplines with the highest ap-
parent GPR’s are, in descending
order, military science, drama,
Chinese, public speaking, Rus-
sian, music, German, compara-
tive literature, Interdepartment-
al, and Latin. Those departments
with the lowest grades include,
from the bottom, English, com-
puter science, politics, sociology,
economics, Italian, anthropology,
geology, accounting and philoso-
phy.

Although no exact figure is
yet available for the University
as a whole, it would appear that
grade inflation has about halted,
for the declines and increases are
fairly balanced. What is notable
is that those departments on the
lower end of the scale seem to
have gone lower, while those
ranked in the upper register ap-
pear to have gone up in general.

These preliminary results fol-
low those results tabulated for
the fall term in their general
trend. Grade inflation, if there
ever really was such a thing at
W&L, has slowed to an almost
imperceptible rate. As was found
with the first term grades, how-
ever, the wide range of GPR’s
registered by various depart-
ments is startling.

Strock, to even things up at 14-
all with 4:30 to play.

Things stayed the same until
Keigler was penalized for play-
ing without a stick with 1:26 left
(the stick broke in half as Keigler
guarded Griebe).

Goalie Charlie Brown, who had
been in the cage all game as
Hastings rested a bad ankle,
stopped Griebe’s hard shot with
1:07 left, However, as Brown
cleared the ball, W&L was caught
offside, thus giving the ball back
to the Tigers.

Still a man up, Towson set up
another play, but lost the ball.
Defenseman Dave Eubank came
up with possession, and Generals’
coach Jack Emmer called time-
out to set up a final play.

Originally the play was de-
signed to let Carroll isolate on
a defenseman from behind the
goal. Instead, Carroll tried to
pass off to an open man in
front of the cage, but the pass
missed and the ball was mid-
field-bound.

After one Towson player miss-
ed the ball Baugher picked it
up, dodged one defender near the
midfield stripe, avoided another
Tiger just inside the attack box,
spun around a third Towson
man, then let loose with a bounce
shot that just stayed under the
crossbar.

As soon as the ball hit the net
the W&L bench exploded, and
for a playoff berth were very,
once again the Generals’ hopes
very real.

W@L lacrosse coach Jack Emmer

Emmer presents
Contact reschedules Kilpatrick

By ROBERT LUTZ

Contact °75 will extend its
yearly lecture series with a special
presentation entitled ‘Australia
14—W&L °75” to be given by
W&L lacrosse coach Jack Emmer
on Wednesday, May 14 at 7:30
p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Coach Emmer’s speech will
focus on “what it takes to be a
W&L lacrosse player,” as well as
the recent history and current
status of the W&L lacrosse pro-
gram. Emmer, _ thrice-named
Coach of the Year, notes that
the program has been largely
dependent on student support
and plans to discuss this year’s
relative lack of success, as well
as his expectations for the future.
He feels that the presentation
will be both interesting and en-
tertaining for all members of
the W&L community.

In conjunction with Emmer’s
talk, a multi-media show with
music and slides will be pre-
sented on last summer’s Austral-
jan World Games Tour made by
Coach Emmer along with de-

Mock Democratic conventions
very successful over the years

By REED MORGAN
Washington and Lee Mock
Convention picks Bentsen, or

Udall, or Carter, or Harris, or
Jackson, or Carter, or perhaps
a dark horse candidate such as
Florida Governor Reubin Askew,
or Walter Mondale,

One year from today, the 1976
Mock Democratic National Con-
vention will attempt to predict
the Democrat's choice for the
next presidential election. Hav-
ing convened the night before to
hear nationally prominent poli-
ticians address the needs of the
future, having debated and re-
solved the platform (which, in its
final form, reflects student
opinion), and having heard
nominating speeches for all the
candidates, the results of three
years of meticulous planning will
begin to show.

The Mock Convention began in
1908, inspired by William Jen-
nings Bryan's visit to Lexington
that year. The convention's
choice of Bryan then was correct.
In 1912, the tradition was begun
of holding the convention for
the party out of the White House.
The mock Democrats were wrong,

twenty-third ballot even. It took
the real convention one hundred
and three ballots. The conven-
tion was correct in its 1928 and
1932 picks of, respectively, Al
Smith and F.D.R. The next
Democratic convention conven-
ed in 1952, and predicted the
choice of Adlai Stevenson, John
Kennedy took the nomination in
1960.

The W&L convention was
wrong in 1972, on a Democrat
that time, for the first time in
twenty years. McGovern came to
within twenty-six votes of win-
ning the third ballot, and Ken-
nedy was drafted on the seventh.
What happened is a topic of
much debate and little agree-
ment. The convention barely
missed McGovern, miscalculated,
and was mistaken. The conven-
tion's choice, erroneous as it now
appears, was reported typically
by Time ‘(one full column), the
National Observer (one third of
a page), and hundreds of papers
across the nation.

W&L's record has been better
with the Democrats, perhaps be-
cause there has been a more na-
tural objectivity on the part of

however, with Judson Harmon. the predominantly Republican

Monday's

By JOE FITZGERALD
The Phi News Staff

The Executive Committee an-
nounced the winners and run-
off candidates for the University
Council Monday night. Run-off
elections were scheduled to be
held Wednesday.

Keith Crocker and _ Scott
Stevenson won two of the senior
seats on the U.C. The third was
to be decided by a run-off be-

tween Bob Graham and Jim
Pearson.

Woody Woodell and Ken
Voelker won the junior seats.

George Griffin, John Wheatley,
Steve Marzo, and David Low
were placed in the run-offs for
the sophomore seats on the coun-
cil.

In other business, the E.C,
heard a report from Jay Duriv-
age of the Cold Check Commit-
tee concerning the possible need
for more than the $270 left in
their budget for covering bad
checks for the remainder of the
year.

The E.C. agreed to support the
committee if their present funds
are not adequate.

Durivage also reported that
seniors who owe money to the
committee when they graduate
will not be given transcripts from
the university until the debt is
settled. Underclassmen who have
not paid for bad checks will not
be allowed to matriculate in the
fall.

Also, the E.C. voted to set up
a reserve fund to hold the money
left over from the Student Ac-
tivities Board budget at the end
of the year. The funds forming
the reserve are expected to total
$600. Without the special re-
serve fund the money would re-
vert back to the student body
reserve fund.

John Killpack and David Mat-
thews, outgoing co-chairmen of
the SAB, also reported that gate
receipts from the Four Tops con-
cert exceeded expectations by
$400.

In other business, Scott Prank-
lin and Sandy Stradtman re-
ported on an Honor Seminar that
they attend at U.Va. during
the spring break. The schools

ed from the military academies,

Franklin and Stradtman both
expressed a willingness to talk

Also, Woody Ray and Everett

IREVIEW andOuTLooxl “The Last Road Trip”

Integrity in the Dining Hall

A subcommittee reported back to the Student Executive
Committee last Monday night on the results of a question-
naire given to freshmen concerning certain policies in Evans
Dining Hall. The questions on the form dealt with the problem
of non-contract students taking meals without paying for
them, with contract students taking extra food for their
friends, and with students taking only salads or drinks with-
out paying. The freshmen polled were asked whether or not
they were aware of the policies and what means should be
used to insure that regulations are followed.

Our faith in the continued existence of the Honor System
at Washington and Lee has been shaken. When asked if
they were aware of current policy, 251 out of a total of 293
persons polled replied in the affirmative. The rest either re-
sponded that they were unaware of any policy or did not
care to comment. When asked what means should be used
to enforce the rules, 125 out of 244 students answered that
persons caught taking food without paying should be dealt
with by the Executive Commitee as a violator of the Honor
System.

Sixty-two students felt that the issuance of contract passes
which must be shown to the checker at every meal was a
reasonable way to control any problems, Another thirty-seven
students indicated their approval of the use of machines to
check identification cards which would have to be displayed
at every meal. The remaining twenty students proposed vari-
ous other ideas, most of which were impractical or facetious.

Only slightly over half of those students questioned show-
ed a preference toward treating the deliberate stealing of food
in the dining hall as an offense of honor, Only one half.
The rest would rather see the instalation of machines and
turnstiles and more checkers, an affront to one of the few
college campuses which still proclaims itself as an adherent
of an Honor System, As the system in the dining hall now
stands, the basic assumption is that W&L students are honest ;
a large per centage of those same students do not seem to
believe in this premise.

We would like to think that those students who indicated
dissatisfaction with the policy of treating the taking of food
as an Honor violation do basically support the Honor System
but we are not convinced, Several of the persons voicing
disapproval felt that current policy should be publicized more,
that those who took food without paying just were not aware
that such an action was dishonest. Others wrote that the
offending students should be dealt with by the Executive
Council, but should not be asked to leave the University for
such a minor offense,

If these replies are any indication of the moral attitude of
even some of the students attending Washington and Lee,
then we as a student body are in sad shape. If the integrity
of a student, or the lack of it, allows him to cheat the dining
hall here, or if mechanical paraphernalia is needed to keep
him from cheating, then what will that same person do when
he is faced with a similar situation later in life?

Even closer to the present, what will that same student
do when given the opportunity to cheat on a test or plagiarize
a term paper?

Recently a conference on student conduct was held at the
University of Virginia. Representatives from Washington and
Lee were present to offer their views on honor systems in
general and on the establishment of acceptable standards
of student conduct. In small group discussions the use of
such terms as honor and integrity were restricted because the
definitions of such terms are so “nebulous.” Now really. Is
honor such an ephemeral concept that it escapes definition?

We think not. Further, we think that most students, if
they stopped to think about it, would prefer to live under
a system where honesty and integrity were basic components
of one's code of behavior. We hope that those students who
responded to the questionnaire stating their belief in the
Honor System consistently support it, and that those who
do not can be convinced by others that honor is a concept
worth preserving at Washington and Lee. —S.C.Y.

By MIKE FERRARA

It has been said by some that
Washington and Lee is one of
the finest institutions of learn-
ing in the country, Of course,
they never say what you learn
at W&L. Unfortunately, W&L is
not co-educational, and your
average hot-blooded — scholar
spends a good deal of his time
searching for truth and knowl-
edge beyond his mountain re-
treat in Lexington. For here at
historic Washington and Lee we
have both academic excellence
and social deprivation. This de-
privation is very convieniently
glossed over in The Catalogue.
It states very matter-of-factly:

Washington and Lee men
have little trouble finding
dates. A number of women’s
colleges are nearby. To the
north are Mary Baldwin Col-
lege and Madison College; to
the east are Sweet Briar Col-
lege, Randolph-Macon Wo-
man's College, and Southern
Seminary Junior College; and
to the south is Hollins College.
A variety of social and other
activities are sponsored in con-
junction with these women’s
colleges.

The time of year when a lot
of the “variety of social and
other activities” take place is
during the Spring Term, and
since there are only six weeks
in that term, one must make the
most of his precious time. And
as the term comes to a close,
your basic W&L stud takes to

the road for that last nostalgic
trip to his favorite nesting place.

These havens for the harried
student are just waiting for you
to get your sweaty little hands
on them. Road trips are certainly
essential for your sanity at W&L,
because if you stay here long
enough you will think the whole
world is male (and when you go
on that last road trip in the
Spring, observing a women’s col-
lege, you will think the whole
world is male there too).

That virile playboy has two
choices for his last adventure in
ecstasy in the Spring. He can
go down the road on the week-
end, or during the week. The
middle of the week is more pro-
ductive, being the time tuna
are most abundant, Most of the
fisheries have their dances dur-
ing the week as well. These
dances usually involve paying a
dollar to walk around the gym
and look stupid, as opposed to
doing it for free the rest of the
time.

By the time Spring finally rolls
around, you will be able to look
up and old “friend.” This is a girl
you talked with for five minutes
at a mixer one night where
you managed to wrench her
name and dorm number out.
When you ask if she wants to
share with you some last sizzl-
ing seconds before you go home,
you'll get an excuse like, “My
grandmother just died, and I
have to fly to Charleston right
now to pay my respects.’ But

Students, faculty author
science research papers

Eight faculty members and 17
students are authors or co-auth-
ors of research papers to be de-
livered at the upcoming annual
meeting of the Virginia Academy
of Sciences.

The research papers largely re-
port the results of scientific in-
vestigation undertaken by the
students and teachers under
W&L's Robert E. Lee Research
Program, which each year sup-
ports advanced scholarly projects
by a large number of students
under individual directors from
the faculty.

Papers will be presented to the
V.AS. in physics, chemistry and
psychology. The annual meeting
takes place this week at Madi-
son College in Harrisonburg.

In physics, research reports
will be delivered on electron
spectroscopy, a method of ana-
lyzing physical substances, by Dr.
W. Barlow Newbolt with two stu-
dents and on the deuteron, an
atomic particle, by Dr, Harry T.
Williams and one student.

In chemistry, a paper prepared
by five students under Dr. J.
Keith Shillington on oxidization
of a chemical compound will be
presented. Also in chemistry,
papers will be delivered on or-
ganic cage compounds by Dr.
George S. Whitney and a stu-
dent researcher and on employ-
ing the computer in chemistry by
Drs. John H. Wise and J. Brown
Goehring.

Four papers will be presented
in the field of psychology — by
Dr. David G. Elmes with two stu-
dents on the role of rehearsal in
behavior, two students on devel-
opment of recognizing and com-

pleting sentences, by Dr. Leo-
nard E, Jarrard with a student
researcher the effects of damage
in the area of the brain known as
the hippocampus, and by three
students under Dr. Jarrard’s di-
rection on the effects of damage
in rat brains.

just hearing an excuse like that
in smooth Southern Slang is
worth the price of admission
alone.

If you are lucky enough to
have a date long enough to drop
her off just prior to dorm-clos-
ing, you are in line for another
treat. When you get to the lobby,
there will be an over-weight ma-
tron giving you dirty looks and
watching your every move. Your
girlfriend will try to give her
a big smile and say: “Good night,
Mrs. Hoffenmuller.’ The old
toad won't get the hint, prob-
ably because the school pays her
not to get the hint and will stay
there with her arms folded. You
will then signal defeat by stretch-
ing out your hand,

Before leaving for the last
time this year, you might feel
nature calling, and proceed to
the men’s room. After getting a
good grasp on the situation, you
hear some keys jingling outside.
Trying to get out, you discover

that one of the Pinkertons have
locked you in. Don't des-
pair though, someone will hear
you screaming, and send you on
your way back to Lexington,
with the strong warning: ‘Don’t
try to hide in there again, son.”
Pinkertons take demonic plea-
sure in throwing men off the
girl’s campuses, especially in the
Spring, mainly because’ they
can't stand seeing you have a
good time while they stand a-
round and gawk.

All these travails during the
last weeks of the school year will
help you study better. Seing the
gentler sex in their natural
habitat will put your mind at
east for finals. And when you
are looking over your gas re-
ceipts for the year, you can think
of all the fun you had. Next
year, you'll probably settle for
those one or two exchange stu-
dents in the library with their
legs crossed, while burning that
certain page in The Catalogue.

Special letter to the editor

Dear Eminent Editor:

I regret to inform you that
your proposal to be invited to
the Annual E.C. Banquet can-
not be approved. As you know
there has always been hostility
between the government and the
press, but speaking for myself,
I am sure the other members of
the Committee would have no
objections if you attend in your
professional capacity, i.e., with
camera, note pad, and pencil.

A distraught EC member
Everett Martin

ca + ae

Mr. Martin:

We are shocked and chagrin-
ned by the fact that the Execu-
tive Committee did not see fit
to invite its friend and ally of
long-standing to Tuesday night's
gala high above the campus in
the Alumni House, We hope that
this year’s EC Banquet gave the
guests dysentery, or at least
dyspepsia. In all honesty, we

think the EC has the right to
wine and dine its members in
the best fashion with delicacies
paid for from the student body
tax, but we also insist that we
be invited to enjoy the fruits of
your graft and corruption, By
failing to invite the eminent
editor, i.e., me, you have struck
the first blow and established for
all time an adversary relation-
ship between the Phi and the
EC.

—JLR

NOTICE

On May 8th at 7 p.m. the
Executive Committee will discuss
the $5-proposal, a suggestion
that every student be allowed to
designate five dollars of his stu-
dent tax to the group or activity
of his choosing. All students are
invited and encouraged to at-
tend.

BOOKS FOR

Dean of Students at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, The letter is
in reference to the spillage of
paint on the Rotunda steps. It
also explains the action taken
by the IFC.

April 19, 1975
Dear Dean Canevari:

On behalf of the Interfratern-
ity Council and the student body
of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity, we were most distressed to
learn of the recent incident at
the Rotunda involving the spill-
ing of paint on the marble steps
by Washington and Lee fratern-
ity members on a_ pledging
activity. The matter has been in-
vestigated and sanctions were
taken by the Judicial Board of
the IFC against the social fra-
ternity responsible. The fratern-
ity and the members involved
regret the unfortunate damage
resulting from their thoughtless-
ness and careless behavior.

We were informed that the
University of Virginia incurred
approximately $50 in expense to
repair the damage caused by the
spilled paint. Enclosed is a letter
from the president of the fra-
ternity involved and a check for
$50 to reimburse the school. The
fraternity in question is the
source of this money. If your
expenses exceed $50, we would
appreciate your so advising us.

We wish to stress that the
damage resulted from careless-
ness in carrying out a fraternity
pledge project rather than from
any malicious act or deliberate
intent to cause damage to the
historic Rotunda area. We sin-
eerely regret the occurence of
these acts and hope that the
matter is satisfactorily resolved.
Thank you very much for your
understanding and cooperation.

Your very truly,
Thomas B, Ramey, III
President, IFC

Lacrosse Generals hit 7-6 season mark

By BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
tournament hopes were dimin-
ished but not demolished Satur-
day when Washington College,
the nation’s second ranked col-
lege division team, handed the
Generals their fourth one-goal
loss of the 1975 season, 15-14.

Coupled with an easy 17-4
romp over William and Mary
earlier in the week, the loss left
W&L with a 7-6 season mark,
a record which ordinarily might
not merit post-season considera-
tion but will because of the many
crazy happenings in college la-
crosse this year,

With just two weeks left in
the regular season, no fewer than
12 teams remain in contention
for the eight berths in the
NCAA-Division I championships.
The Generals are one of those 12.

The week in review:

The Generals ended any doubt
about the outcome of their en-
counter with William and Mary
by scoring nine straight goals
before the Indians scored with
1:32 left in the first half.

Senior attackman Dave War-
field, who personally destroyed
Towson State the Saturday be-
fore with seven goals and four
assists, continued his string of
high-scoring games with six
goals and a pair of assists.

Rob Morgan, W&L’s leading
goal scorer, and freshmen Scott
Baugher and Jay Sindler each
scored twice, while Don Carroll,
Jay Monahan, Ralph Baugher,
Boyd Martin, and Jim Engle-
hart each had a goal.

Carroll added to his team-
leading point total with seven
assists.

Mike Cordrey’s fourth goal of
the game with 3:01 left gave
Washington College a 15-14 win
over W&L Saturday in a game
more than one of the Generals
said they “should have won by
a handful of goals.”

The Shoremen, who earlier in
the week had dropped a 10-8
decision to upstart Salisbury
State, twice rallied behind the
scoring of Cordrey and Myrt

game, the Generals failed to con-
vert on the man-up situation,
and with 27 seconds left, called
a time-out to set up one last
play.

The call went to Warfield, who
was to isolate against defense-
man John Elliott. After two
quick moves, Warfield moved in
on Matthews, who had already
made 26 saves.

The shot went for the top part
of the net. Matthews moved to
the ball, and instead of playing
it with his stick he used his
head to make the save.

The speed of the ball was
enough to knock Matthews’
helmet off, but the shot stayed
out, and after running out the
clock, the Shoremen had estab-

Admissions applications up,
acceptances right on target

Contrary to the nation-wide
trend among private colleges, ap-
plications for admission, as well
as confirmations from accepted
students, are up sharply this year
at Washington and Lee.

This rise comes despite in-
creased selctivity on the part of
W&L admissions officials.

The university received nearly
1,400 applications for admission
to next year’s freshman class—
four applications for every va-
cancy—representing an increase
of 12 per cent over last year’s
total. W&L seeks a freshman
class of 350 each year. To date
366 confirmations have been re-
ceived.

While no statistical analyses
have yet been prepared, the ad-
missions office estimate that the
academic quality of next year’s
freshmen will remain high. Wil-
liam A. Noell, associate admis-
sions director and coordinator of
the freshman year, reads every
application and all supporting

papers, and comments of the stu-
dents who have confirmed their
attendance next fall: “My im-
pression is that the men from
whom we have heard so far are
at least as well qualified as any
class in recent years.”

W&L held its tuition increase
to 3.8 per cent for 1975-76 over
the current year, raising it just
$100 to $2,700.

Each year the Ring-tum Phi presents awards

University with new “balance sheets.”

Through great insight and hard work he has
turned what might have been dormant assets of

avenues to sell the patterns of

he has contrived to have reproductions of the
Reeves Collection produced in such a way as to
provide even greater royalties to the University
from its use. By finding new ways to utilize this
collection he has brought wide-spread publicity to
the school; even the White House has found a
way to use Wamsutta’s Porcelain Butterfly sheets.

This is the ninth year in which the Ring-tum

edge substantial contributions to the school from
people whose work and dedication might other-
wise have been overlooked by the student body,

Acting chairman Steve Robin-

suggestion that the penalty be

Development program outlined

ty STEVE YEVICH
Phi Feature Editor

On February 22, 1972, Presi-
dent Huntley announced a $56
million development drive for
Washington and Lee, The first
phase of the plan was to raise $36
million by 1976; these funds
would be used to enlarge the
University’s endowment, to ex-
pand and improve the physical
plant, and to augment the year-
ly operating budgets.

Three quarters of that initial
four year period have shipped by,
and in terms of total dollars
pledged the program is about
where it should be, with $28 mil-
lion already given or committed
to the University. In terms of
the development of new facili-
ties what seems to be lagging
is the construction of the new
library.

Many students graduate from
this institution without realiz-
ing what consumes much of the
time the Board of Trustees de-
vote to W&L. Most students are
not aware of the comprehensive
development plans which are
generated by the Board. All who
attend here, and particularly
those who will soon graduate,
should have some general know!l-
edge of the broad outline being
followed by W&L in the constant
effort to improve the quality of
education for its students.

‘The needs of the University
demand that we raise at least
$36 million by 1976; against this

broad objective we have raised
something shy of $28 million.”
So states Farris Hotchkiss, Di-
rector of University Develop-
ment. It is a major task of Mr.
Hotchkiss’ office to coordinate
the activities of the many groups
involved in generating support
for W&L's ambitious program.

Specifically, what the first
phase of the program consists
of is an increase in the Uni-
versity'’s endowment of $14 mil-
lion, an outlay of $18'» million
for new construction and renova-
tions to existing buildings, and
the accumulation of $3'» million
to be used in the general operat-
ing budget.

The endowment of the Uni-
versity stood at approximately
$24 million at the outset of the
development program. To date
roughly $4 million has been in-
vested in the University's port-
folio, and another $3.8 million
has been pledged In this area
the program is behind on its
goal; with 75% of the time period
elapsed, only 65° of the target
figure for endowment has been
raised. During this period the
decline in the market value of
the endowment has also more
than offset the increases, al-
though the income from the in-
vestments has remained virtually
unchanged

The second major portion of
the program, the construction of
new facilities, while on schedule
in terms of total dollars com-
mitted is lagging in terms of

tangible development. Specifical-
ly, construction of the library has
been delayed owing to insuffici-
ent funding of the addition to
Doremus Gymnasium.

The new wing on the gym was
constructed first for a number
of reasons. As the most-used
building on campus, surpassing
even the library in usage, the old
gym was a detriment to the
moraie of students and faculty
alike. It was desperately in need
of renovation, and in fact an
expansion of the building had
been promised for a number of
years. At the start of the pro-
gram a few extraordinarily gen-
erous alumni made substantial
gifts to the University specific-
ally for construction of a new
gymnasium. These gifts. totaling

about $'» million, enabled the
project to get off the drawing
board quickly. As the smallest

item. financially, of the majo
construction projects envisioned,
and as its construction would
intrude the least on the main
campus plan, it was decided to
bulld the structure early in the
program Architectural plans
were developed rather speedily
‘six months as compared to eigh-
teen months for the plans of the
library), and the project was
compieted in a minimum of time
By getting the gymnasium ad-
dition underway, the University
avoided escalating costs that
have hampered the library pro-

Should W&L admit women?

* BEN BAILEY

Does W&L really need women?
A special committee of the Board
of Trustees was established at
the beginning of this academic
year to investigate the possibility
of co-education at Washington
and Lee. The committee, con-
sisting of four Trustees, the
deans, and the student body
president, has consulted alumni,
parents, the faculty, the EC, and

other schools for answers to the |

following questions.

Why should W&L consider go-
ing co-ed? Social, philosophical

and practical reasons are all
worth mentioning.

dating would be simplier if the
girls lived in Lexington. In a
world where all minorities, in-
cluding women, are participating
more fully than ever before, the
preservation of an _ all-male
school apparently ignores all the
“facts of life,’ and may indeed
prove to be inadequate training
for the future, And, from a prac-
tical standpoint, the quantity and
quality of W&L’s applicants has
dropped in the last few years. If
you have little faith in objective
measures like board scores and
class rank, just ask your favorite
professor what he thinks of the
most recent entering classes, and
chances are that he'll think the

  

The co-ed question revived

Elsewhere on this page President of the Student Body Ben

Bailey asks the question,

“Does

W&L

really need women?”

Mr. Bailey is only doing his job in bringing this question to
the attention of the students, but we find it regrettable that
such a query must be considered again, Of course, W&L
does not need women, any more than it needs space-age
architecture or a course in basket weaving offered by the art
department,

Mr. Bailey reiterates some of the same arguments for co-
education that we have all heard, and yawned at, from the
day one. Although we appreciate Bailey's open-mindedness,
“social, philosophical, and practical reasons” are not worth
mentioning. W&L cannot, and should not attempt to, educate
its students in the ways of the world, It should provide a
haven for individual development outside the pressures and

not just among those

who apply here. W&L has been holding its own on this
front and has maintained high standards, unlike some of the
schools to which Mr. Bailey alludes. As to the quantity of
applicants, the numbers are on the decline nationally, but
Washington and Lee has managed to stay well ahead of
most schools in this regard.

In other words, there is no reason for alarm at this point,
and no true indication that the school is heading toward hard
times. We believe that Washington and Lee can maintain
its traditional high standards without sacrificing its distinctive
character by adopting that which is currently fashionable in
egghead circles. Carting in truckloads of females would
jeopardize W&L.’s unique environment. In the light of Mr.
Bailey's considerations on co-education, we feel that Wash-
ington and Lee has a great deal to lose by such a move, with
a less-than-complete picture of what cauld be gained, if
anything.

students are less qualified than
before.

What are the pros and cons of
co-education? This basic ques-
tion breaks down into many
particular queries. What effect
will girls have on the fraternity
system? What will happen to
the area's girl schools if W&L
becomes co-ed? How will the cur-
riculum be affected, if at all?
Will the calibre of the student
body improve? (Evidence from
other schools which have recent-
| ly gone co-ed indicates that the
| quality does increase.) Will the
financial aid program be severely
pressed for funds? Where shall
we put the girls and how much
will it cost? Do we have adequate
physical education facilities for

,; women? (The athletic depart-

| ment thinks not.) And what im-
pact will women have on the
community spirit of which W&L
is so justifiably proud? Will the
Honor System be strained?

The answers to these and
many other questions suround-
ing co-education must be de-
termined before any action is
taken,

Three possible ways to add
women have been tried else-
where. Some schools remain the
same size and simply substitute
girls for guys. Others maintain
the size of the male student
population and add women, thus
enlarging the student body. The
third way is a compromise, in
which two or three hundred men

are dropped and five or six hun-
dred women added. If W&L goes
co-educational, one of these
models will be employed.

What do you think about the
question raised above? The
Trustees’ committee instructed
me to solicit student opinions on
the prospects of co-education.
They would welcome your writ-
ten comments, and would like to
have them in time for the Trus-
tees’ meeting next week. If you
would like to sound off on what
would be right or wrong about
co-education, please send your
comments to me at post office

Letters to the Editor...

Arguments against

the $5 proposal aired

To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
I oppose the five dollar pro-

posal as presented to the Execu-

tive Committee because of its

serious conceptual, financial, and

administrative flaws

The proposal allows small in-
terest groups to commit a por-
tion of the student body tax to
their endeavors. Thus, one’s self-
ish interests would be the motive
for the spending of our monies,
the Executive Committee would
surrender some of its strength as
a representative body, according
to this plan. Were the EC to
institute this policy, they would
be abdicating their present con-
trol of the purse strings and
their elected responsibility,

While propents of the five dol-
lar proposal claim that it would
insure more representative gov-
ernment, better utilization of the
channels now open to them
would accomplish this. The pro-
gram of the EC's standing sub-
committees should be carefully
evaluated and frequently observ-
ed. This would insure that por-
tions of the student tax are
wisely spent. Furthermore, should
a student or group of students
wish monies to fund a project,
such funds can be requested of
the Executive Committee. I see
no need for the paperwork and
the expenditure of much time
that would result from the five
dollar proposal when any W&L
student can currently request
that he be allowed monies from
the student tax.

It should be noted that the
five dollar proposal does not give
members of the student body
liscense to spend portions of the
Student body tax as they wish.
Students seeking funds for their
project must convince their
classmates of its worth, solicite
student body support, petition
the EC. Then, they may or may
not be granted the desired funds.
I fail to see the difference be-
tween current policy, whereby
one solicites funds from the EC
by convincing them of the worth
of his idea and is granted the
money only if the EC approves,
and the proposed five dollar pol-
ley, whereby one solicites funds
from the EC by convincing them
of the worth of his idea and is
granted the money only if the
EC approves.

From a financial perspective,
it is doubtful whether the needs
of the EC standing subcommit-
tees (such as the Student Activi-
ies Board which spends monies
on the entire student body)
could be fulfilled if $8,000 of the
student tax were marked “hands
off” in accordance with the five
dollar proposal, Rather, this
money would be spent, not by
those whom were elected to ad-
minister our student tax, but by
various cliques with their own

subjective interests. The EC
would operate with an insuffici-
ent budget that would not allow
for the cost of living increases
nor for improvement upon exist-
ing programs. In short, we would
have to settle for less than we
had this year, while our tax
would be raised $5 per student.

Indeed, this year’s EC, whose
budget was $48,000 (approxi-
mately next year’s budget ac-
cording to the five dollar pro-
posal) had a difficult task
making ends meet. They twice
were forced to dip into the re-
serve fund to “balance” their
books. To return to the days
when the EC could work within
their budget, an $8,000 student
tax increase was deemed neces-
sary and granted, Yet, propon-
ents of the five dollar proposal
claim that they can manage with
last year’s allotment. Their pro-
posal would undo what the tax
increase is designed to do: name-
ly, to provide the EC with a
realistic budget with which to
operate, and to insure that the
Student tax is fairly distributed
among all students. It seems right
that the members of the Execu-
tive Committee, being account-
able to their constituency, are
the custodian of all the student
tax. Proponents of the five dol-
lar proposal would have one-
seventh of the budget placed in
the hands of the students at
large who are responsible only
to themselves.

The amount of interest that
this proposal would generate
among the student body is also
questionable. The recent Univer-
sity Council elections echo
charges of student apathy. For
three senior positions, the class
of "76 fielded two candidates, the
third member being elected on
a write-in ballot with less than
thirty votes. The class of ‘77
posted two candidates for two
positions. Do these disappoint-
ing results lead one to believe
many students will take the
initiative to solicite the support
of their classmates to present an
acceptable project for EC ap-
proval? «The president-elect has
stated that grain parties do not
constitute “acceptable projects").

While the goal of the propon-
ents of the five dollar propsal
to insure a more representative
budget is an admirable and at-
tainable one, I fear, for the
above reasons cited, that their
efforts may be somewhat mis-
directed. Rather than earmark-
ing one-seventh of the total
budget for worthwhile student
organizations or endeavors, the
EC should better publicize their
current policy to fund student
projects and should be receptive
to the needs of those students
whose interests are not refi®cted
by the various standing subcom-
mittees.

Arguments supporting
the $5 plan expressed

To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
Apathy: The $5 plan chal-
lenges campus apathy in two
ways. First, the plan makes each
student responsible for allocat-
ing $5 of the student body bud-
get. Second, by making money
directly available to any campus
group which can convince stu-
dents to donate their $5 to its
activities, the plan encourages
students to organize, to carry
out a campus-related program.
In addition, the plan can be
used to improve or purchase
equipment for any part of the
university, Thus the $5 plan
makes possible EC funding for
any group arousing student in-
terest and includes each stu-
dent in the allocation process.

Administration: Two propos-
als have been advocated for ad-
ministering the $5 plan. Each
involves some paperwork for the
EC, but under neither of the
proposals are the EC's minist-
erial duties overwhelming.

Insufficient funds to finance
the $5 plan: The 1975-1976 stu-
dent budget has been increased
$8,000, the amount necessary to
fund the $5 plan. The separate
financing of Mock Convention,
coupled with additional savings,
has made available another $3.,-
500 for next year’s budget. Thus
activities which are presently
funded can receive, in addition
to the amount they received this
year, part of the $3,500 extra
funds and leave $8,000 for the
donation plan.

Some presently funded com-
mittees argue, however, that the
$3,500 split among them is in-
sufficient to cover increased costs
and the activities which they
have planned for next year. This
argument overlooks three points.
First, any student could donate
his $5 to a currently funded com-
mittee and thereby increase its
budget. Second, to force com-
mittees to operate within slightly
increased budgets next year
would force each committee to
reevaluate its programs to cut

wasteful activities. Third, though

the organjzations presently re- °

ceiving EC money are important,
they are not the ONLY student
activities worthy of funding. The
$5 plan would make 6/7 avail-
able to currently budgeted com-
mittees, and leave 1/7 available
for all other campus activities,
Such an allocation would seem
fair.

Fraternity livens up
spring social calendar

To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

As the wise man once said to
his disgruntled son, “You only
go around once in life, but if
you live it right, once is enough.”
Well, fellas, that saying can be
applied to the spring term at
W&L.

It just doesn’t seem like there
have been enough of the “vint-
age” W&L parties this spring—
those heavy on “wine, women
and song.” But exams are not
here yet and you're not home
scrounging for that summer job
yet. You can salvage those last
hours of partying and you can
squeeze out those remaining bits
of wildness.

Delta Tau Delta is going to
give you an opportunity for a
last, big spring fling this Friday
night, May 16, from 8:30 on.
There will be lots of women,
constant music and plenty of
liquor. And, for the wildest of
the wild, there will be a Gator-
ing Contest later the same eve-
ning. There will be a 50 cent ad-
mission charge for this contest
and prizes will be awarded—
three $5 third prizes, one $10
second prize and one $25 ’prize.

So, if you missed other parties
this spring or are anxious to have
one last big one, come to Delta
Tau Delta Friday night. You can
drink and juke and flirt and
gator the night away. It'll put
you in the right frame of mind
to watch W&L whip the Wahoos
on Saturday.

Generals defeat Rutgers, look to U.Va.

The crowd probably won't
match last year’s record-setting
10,000, but it figures to tax the
7,000-seat capacity of Wilson
Field when Washington and Lee
is host to its old rival, the Uni-
versity of Virginia, here Satur-
day.

The annual battle for state
supremacy between the two la-
crosse powers will get under way
at 2:00 p.m. Both teams are
hopeful of receiving invitations
to the NCAA _ championship
tournament for the fourth
straight year.

Virginia, 6-4 for the season, is
currently ranked fourth among
University division teams, with
W&L's Generals 10th with a 9-6
record,

This year’s crowd probably
won't be as large because Vir-
ginia will have finished school
and most of its students will
have left the campus. The two
teams played earlier in the sea-
son last year when the largest
crowd to see a lacrosse game in
the Old Dominion sat in sun-
drenched Scott Stadium. W&L
won the game, which was tele-
vised nationally, 13-11.

It, appeared to observers that
about 6,000 fans sat on the Vir-
ginia side, the other 4,000 on the
W&L side.

However many come to this
Saturday’s game, they should
see another classic example of
the ever-growing popular sport
of lacrosse. Virginia, which boasts
a potent defense around goalie
Rodney Rullman and defenseman
Willie Hazlehurst, numbers per-
ennial lacrosse power Maryland
among its victims.

With one of the most potent
attacks in the country, W&L Gen-
erals under Coach Jack Emmer
have beaten Towson (at the time
ranked no. 1 among college di-
vision teams) and leveled Roa-
noke, 15-11, and no. 7-ranked
Rutgers, 14-13, in their most re-
cent action last week.

Among them, W&L’s three at-

Lexington
Hardware

23 S. Main
463-2242

tackmen have scored 115 goals,
with junior Rob Morgan scor-
ing 47, senior Dave Warfield and
junior Don Carroll 34 each.
Those three also lead the team
in assists, with Carroll record-
ing 42, Warfield 25 and Morgan
24.

That gives W&L’s attack trio
a total point production of 206—
76 for Carroll, 71 for Morgan
and 59 for Warfield in just 10
games.

W&L’'s resurgence from early
season disappointments has come
about with the return of injur-
ed All-American attackman Dave
Warfield and a steadily improv-
ing young team.

Warfield, who missed almost
the entire half of the season
with a knee injury, ripped in six
goals against Roanoke and had
one goal and three assists against
Rutgers before suffering a frac-
tured thumb early in the game.
His status against Virginia is ex-
tremely doubtful.

With Warfield having one of
the best days in his career,
W&L and Roanoke battled on
even terms in Roanoke’s Victory
Stadium through nearly three
quarters of action before W&L
scored the last three goals to
pull away. The senior from
Baltimore's St. Paul's school
scored two quick goals in just
1:39 and had five by halftime,
with W&L ahead, 9-7. With Roa-
noke goalie Joe Viola keeping
the Maroons in the game with
some excellent saves, the home
team closed to within a goal,
12-11, midway through the third
quarter.

But from that point W&L
dominated the game almost com-
pletely and pulled away for the
victory.

In contrast, the Generals first
nearly blew visiting Rutgers off
the field, at one point opening
up a seven-goal advantage, 13-6,
then had to withstand a gallant
Rutgers comeback to win by one
goal, 14-13.

Wé#L development program outlined

(Continued from page 1)

But funding has never been
completed on the Doremus pro-
ject. The facility cost $3.3 mil-
lion, and only $1.3 has been
raised. The remainder was origi-
nally financed in what seemed a
satisfactory way, assuming the
completion of funding in a short
time. The finance charges have
been mounting, however, and at
one point were exceeding 11%
annual interest. It is because of
the existence of this funding
shortage that construction has
not been started on the library.
As soon as commitments have
been received to enable full furnd-
ing for the gym, bids will be Ici
on the other facility.

The construction of the new
law school was made possible
by the extremely generous gift of
$9 million to W&L by Sydney
Lewis, an alumnus and president
of Best Products. To a great ex-
tent Mr. Lewis’ contribution sped
up that project and provided
impetus to the overall develop-
ment program.

The third major part of the
University’s four year plan is
the raising of the sum of $32
million through what is called
Annual Giving, which in itself
is composed of three items:
alumni contributions not design-
ated as endowment, contributions
made by parents, and corporate
contributions made through the
aegis of Virginia Foundation for
Independent Colleges. Funds gen-
erated through the Annual Giv-
ing program directly aid the Uni-
versity in balancing its current
operating budget. In contrast,

either endowment or physical

and are not “spent’’ on salaries
and other operating costs.

Class agents and the chairman
of the Parents’ Fund function as
the primary intermediaries in
the collection of Annual Giving
contributions, Money is being
raised, as far as capital gifts
are concerned, by a group of men
known as the Achievement Coun -
cil, chaired by John M. Stem-
mons of Dallas, a member of
the Board of Trustees. The men
who make up the Achievement
Council are drawn from the
Board of Trustees, the board of
directors for the Alumni Associa-
tion, and from alumni and par-
ents generally. The Council has
assumed the major responsibility
for raising the $36 million by
concentrating on the solicitation
of Leadership Gifts of $100,000 or
more that indicate active con-
cern and general support of
the needs of the University. In

other words, members of the
Council are “not knocking on
every door on the block,” as Mr.
Hotchkiss puts it.

The W&L development pro-
gram is unusual in that it is
almost entirely qualitative rather
than quantitative in bearing; the
size of the University is expect-
ed to stay at about the same level
throughout the program. Most
universities are constantly ex-
panding their enrollment and are
forced to embark on new de-
velopment just to provide mini-
mal facilities for their students.
In view of the total program, the
record of achievement has been
remarkable, as relatively few
fund-raising ventures by other
institutions have been as success-
ful in meeting their overall goals.
It appears that with consistent
effort in the coming year the
initial target figure will be reach-
ed, and that enormous sum of
$56 million to be attained by
1979 may actually be attainable.

EC approves donations

suggests honor change

ty JOE FITZGERALD
The Phi News Staff

The Executive Committe end-
ed the year Monday night by
giving away upwards of $200
and passing two definitve and
non-binding recommendations.

The E.C. gave Harry Lee Row-
ing Club $200 to cover the cost
of a few thousand dollars worth
of rowing equipment, plus vari-

ous debts incurred by the club
over the year.
The E.C. normally will give

$100 to a new group on campus
at the beginning of the year and
then leave them on their own.
This custom was waived because
of the expense of rowing equip-
ment and the initiative shown
by the club during the year.

The E.C. also agreed to give
WLUR-FM any money they need

over what is gathered in other
places to cover the cost of broad-
casting yesterday's lacrosse game
against John Hopkins. The
Station has already gathered
enough money to pay for a low-
noise phone line to air the game.
but wanted the E.C. promise as
security against Ma Bell's de-
mands should the game go into
extensive overtime.

The E.C. closed
visions of the honor system by
voting to include the following
standard pledge in the White
Book and to recommend it to
faculty so that they may recom-

out ther re-

mend it to their students: “On
my honor, I have neither given
nor received any unacknowledged

The E.C. also voted, with

recommend that Steve Robinson
shave off his Fu Manchu
mustache.

Hot Damn...

Bring on Maryland...

Those were the feelings of
about two hundred hot, tired but
excited fans on Wednesday eve-
ning at Homewood Field in
Baltimore, Maryland. The 90 de-
gree sun ead made it plain to
the Capital of Lacrosse that the
bids were properly given but just
not in the right order.

On Sunday afternoon the Lex-
ington community learned that
its Lacrosse team had received a
bid to the University Division
NCAA Lacrosse Finals. And that
team from Charlottesville had
not. People who follow lacrosse
took this with some surprise.
Hopkins took it as relief. They
thought their real test would
come from state rival Maryland.
The Jays would blow the Gen-
erals back to Lexington.

But Coach Jack Emmer had
his own ideas; he said, “We
would rather play Johns Hopkins
in the first round of the finals
in Baltimore than any other
team.” Emmer’s reasoning was
based on two points. Washing-
ton and Lee had lost in last

year’s quarter finals to the same
Hopkins team, 11 to 10. W&L
would be up for the re-match.
Secondly, the Generals are a
defensive team. They can handle
any offense used by their op-
ponents. Hopkins was labeled the
strongest shooter in lacrosse.

To counter the two best guns
for Hopkins, Mike O'Neill and
Franz Wittlesberger, Emmer
pulled a surprise. W&L placed
a defenseman who has only play-
ed 16 lacrosse games in his life,

Curly Culp, to manhandle the
junior Wittlesberger. Wittles-
berger had five goals but was
unable to lead his squad and
shot widely another 20 times.

vob Morgan checked O'Neill for
no goals and many bruises.
Lastly the play of Charlie Brown
was superb. Brown stopped 18
shots and most came with a re-
tiring sun in his face.

What will long be remembered
about Brown’s day was not his
defense but the freshman’s of-

fense from the goal. In the sec-
ond period, with Hopkins a man
down, Brown cannoned a 75 yard
shot over the heads of the un-
usually-placed backline for the
Blue Jays. That score coming
in the second quarter capped the
best team-manship performance
from Don Carroll, Rob Morgan
and Dave Warfield to date.
Totally the three scored 8 times.
Of the 11 goals scored for the
Generals, 8 were assisted.
Carroll shot the opening score
in the first minute and a half.
He took the ball around the left-
side of the crease and hit. The
Generals were overwhelmed at
the ease in which Carroll beat
his man. After Hopkins took the
following face-off W&L inter-
cepted a cross-the-crease pass
and started a fast break. With
four quick passes, the last be-
ing a Morgan to Warfield to

2 to 0. The third goal for the

Interpretation of Shakespeare questioned

BARNEY SKELTON
George Bernard Shaw once
said that he would rather read
The Tempest than see it per-
formed on stage. He held this
opinion because he felt that the
imagery of the play was too
ethereal and fantastic to allow
for a convincing physical repre-
sentation. In short, he asserts
that Shakespeare's verse in The
Tempest virtually transcends its
medium of drama. Furthermore,
he implies that attempts to do
justice to the play will, at best,
fall short of what, in a reading,
is evoked in a mind's eyes, and

Ls

at worst may seem potentially
absurd.
Personally. I do not fully con-

cur with Shaw The play is cer-
tainly stageable, but it is ex-
tremely difficult to produce. As
a director. one must handle The
Tempest with kid gloves; heavy-
handed interpretations usually
result in failure, for the sym-
metry of the play is as delicate
as it is complex

Applying these thoughts to the
University Theatre's production
I can only conclude that director
Al Gordon was interested least
of all in symmetry. With the
exception of one scene, I am
convinced that I viewed an ex-
rendition of The Temp-

I will concede that the scene

ean find no textual justification

of this scene. He must have de-

This unfortunate incident
would not be quite so galling

OUTLOOK and REVIEW}

To graduating seniors...

For many students, this is their last full week on campus.
Next Thursday 365 seniors will formally complete their
education, as they receive their diplomas from President
Huntley and flip their tassels to the left.

Four years of life in Lexington, a life full of difficult

   

studies, of nights spent going down the road, of times both
good and bad; four very long and yet very short years will
come to an end for you, the Class of 1975, You will be leaving
this sleepy little town and embarking on a new voyage in
your lives, and doing so at a time when conditions are poor
economically, socially and politically.

We feel confident that you who are about to leave here
will come to grips with any problems that may loom ahead
and will overcome them handily. Washington and Lee hope-
fully has taught you how to cope with more than just term
papers and lab practicals. Your time spent in Lexington has
presumably benefited you in many ways, aiding you in your
mental, physical and spiritual development. All those history
mid-terms, Red Square parties, late-night bull sessions, road
trips, cramming for exams, Truck-Stop runs, and afternoons
at Wilson Field have had their effects on each of you, and
hopefully you are better men for it.

We hope that you graduates-to-be are leaving W&L with
a deep appreciation for the school and for what it has done for

careers, whether they entail further education or a foray into
the business world. To the Class of ’75 we say, “Thank you
for what you have contributed to Washington and Lee during
your stay here.”

—S.C.Y.

.. And to the freshmen

Most freshmen entering college have some apprehensions
about the experience of which they are about to partake.
These considerations may not keep them awake at night but
they are nonetheless real. Most will wonder about this new
life style and about the quality of life at Washington and Lee.

These misgivings are indeed well founded; adapting to
college life is not easy. W&L will expect a great deal from
you, as it does from each member of the student body. The
school will challenge you in every sense, especially academic-
ally and socially. Washington and Lee is here not only to
serve but to be served by those who matriculate.

The success of your first year here is largely dependent
on you. The school provides only the environment and op-
portunity for intellectual and personal growth. It is left to
the individual to meet the challenge which awaits him, One
can only gain by responding to the opportunity provided by
this institution. Freshmen learn that the old maxim still rings
true: you have to put something into it before you can get
anything out of it.

W&L will require your best. This is something we hope
you will assume rather than having to learn from your own
experience. Through dedication to the betterment of both
yourself and the school your stay here will be all it can and
should be.

The only advice that we can offer which will specifically
serve you in your first year here is that you should keep an
open mind to all the new experiences and alternatives with
which you will soon be faced. Do not allow yourself to close
the door to different facets of life at W&L before you have
learned to appreciate that which they have to offer.

While going through freshman orientation make a point
of listening to all those who would advise you. Everybody is
willing to give advice to freshmen, Each person's point of
view will prove helpful if you can possibly absorb it all, As
people tell you about the Honor System or their concept of
the school, listen carefully and learn from them before you
have to learn it on your own,

One important aspect of life at W&L is the fraternity sys-
them, Fraternities were weakened in the sixties, but have
made a strong comeback and are prospering. Today, well over
half of the students are affiliated with Greek houses. Many
people feel that ther fraternity membership has played an
important role in_ their Whatever
prejudices may be, one should go through Rush and attempt

college career. one’s
to gain an understanding of the system here before making
a commitment.

Come to W&L with an open mind and make a point of
listening to other people when you get here, If you do this
vou will be able to enjoy a successful and rewarding first
vear in college. This school has so much to offer that your
tay at W&L will prove a happy one if you only let it,

We look forward to seeing you this fall and sincerely hope
that both you and Washington and Lee profit by your com-
ing Good luck!

Automatic Rule

The Committee on the Automatic Rule will meet at 10:30 a.m.
on Tuesday, June 3, 1975. At that time the Committee will consider
the following groups of students, who have fallen under the Auto-
matic Rule, for possible immediate reinstatement:

1. those students who failed to meet the conditions of Academic

Probation required of them at the end of the current Spring
Term:

2. those students completing a full academic year who failed

to meet the cumulative average required of their class.

The Committee will consider for immediate reinstatement all
students who fall under the Automatic Rule. If any student wishes
to inform the Committee of extenuating circumstances present in his
case, he may write a letter to the Committee and deliver it to the
Office of the Déan of the College before June 3. Immediate rein-
statement is the exception rather than the rule. A student who
falls under the Automatic Rule severs his connection with the Uni-
versity; if the Committee does not grant him immediate reinstate-
ment, he may apply for reinstatement afer a minimum of one year.

As soon as possible afer the Committee's meeting, each student
falling under the Automatic Rule will receive a letter explaining his
status; his parents will receive a copy of that letter.

Any student who is not subject to the Automatic Rule in June
and who fails to achieve the cumulative average required at the end
of a full year for his class ‘see page 84 in Catalogue) will be on
Academic Probation for the Fall Term, and he and his parents will
receive notification.

IFC modifies Rush program

By DAVID URANO

Rush, the bizarre fraternity
practice which freshmen are
subjected to (second only to the
freshmen Natural Bridge experi-
ence), has—thank heaven—un-
dergone some changes.

Rush will be shorter. Rather
than battering freshmen senses
to the middle of October, the IFC
granted a two week reprieve and
rush will fade away at the end
of September.

Fines will be rewarded to any-
one caught abusing rush officials.
So, if anyone plans on lighting
a cigarette off the flaming head
of a rush official, it will cost
him.

Dates, the women and not the
fruit, are now considered mem-
bers of the fraternity, and there-
fore are not permitted to “dirty
rush.” Dirty rush” is the clever
and mature practice of inform-
ing ‘(usually falsely) an un-
suspecting freshman that the
members of Sly Krappa Dogma
are a bunch of perverts who
sneak around Lendy’s women’s
room at night.

Rush officials will visit the
houses periodically throughout
the rush period rather than sit-

Letters to th

Student dissatisfied
with editorial
on co-education

To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Although I am not of an un-
biased opinion on the subject of
co-education at W&L, I will al-
ways respect an opposing view
if it is presented competently.
The editorial in last week's Ring-
tum Phi was not presented com-
petently. The editor's response to
Mr. Bailey's article consisted of
an unpersuasive series of argu-
ment sagainst co-education,
arguments that could have been
handled better, but were not.
Indeed, there were some points
brought up in the editorial that
deserve closer attention.

First of all, I feel there are
many among us who have not,
as Mr. Reeves proposes, “yawned
at, from the day one” Mr.
Bailey's arguments for the ad-
mission of women. Co-education
is a serious and relevant topic
for consideration, as evidenced
by the decision to establish a
special committee of the Board
of Trustees in order to examine
the possibilities. In this case,
yawning may be the sign of a
closed mind.

It is the editor's next state-
ment that particularly bothers
me: “W&L cannot, and should
not attempt to educate its stu-
dents in the ways of the world.”
Why not? It would seem to me
that “the ways of the world”
are better coped with by the
graduate who has had four years
of education in a realistic en-
vironment ‘i.e. women’. It Is
rather difficult to ignore the fact
that “the ways of the world”
include both sexes

Mr. Reeves seems to feel that
women are a part of the “pres-
sures and tediums of society at
large,” that they are distractions,
and that if co-education was in-
stituted at W&L women would be
brought in “in truckloads.

ting around one house taking
up space and drinking all of
that frat’s coke and beer. (Now
they have a chance to taste
everybody's.)

David Braun, IFC Rush chair-
man, said that the changes were
made to try to “make Rush more
enjoyable while at the same time
trying to make it more efficient.”

There are three new features
to the rush program next year:
first. an old frat will not be
rushing; second, a new frat will
be rushing; and third, for the
first time in W&L history, local
fraternities may be rushing.
Rushing where, nobody knows.

Psi Upsilon, the frat that fold-
ed in the winter, will not be
rushing freshmen because there
are no upperclassmen to do the
rushing.

Kappa Alpha, a_ fraternity
which was reactivated this year,
will have eight men rushing.
Carter Greer, the president of
KA, said that the chapter will
take over the defunct Psi U
house, pink rock and all.

As a result of a recent change
in University policy, chapters are
now allowed to relinquish all
affiliations with their nationals.

Evidently, the editor has a great
deal of respect for the seductive
powers of women; however,
there seem to be many colleges
(all eight Ivy League schools,
for example) that have opted for
co-education, despite the appar-
ent invitation for moral disorder
Mr. Reeves seems to feel must
surely follow.

At a later point in the edi-
torial, Mr. Bailey's prediction of
a better quality of students ‘if
co-education is introduced) is
somewhat brusquely pushed
aside with the statement that
the quality of entering freshmen
is decreasing everywhere. This
may be true, yet the obvious fact
remains: by decreasing the
amount of male students ad-
mitted (one type of co-education
proposed) the degree of selectiv-
ity will certainly increase.

With all respect to Mr. Reeves’
opinion, the prospect of co-edu-
cation is not being considered
because it is, as he suggests,
“eurrently fashionable in ege-
head circles;” it is being con-
sidered because it is a realistic
proposal, and one that is long
overdue in many circumstances.

Because of this, several houses
are looking into the idea of do-
ing just that which will make
the frat a local.

Braun said, “With all these
changes, next year’s rush looks
as if it will be more exciting than
ever. If nothing else, it certainly
will be different.” This remains
to be seen.

FINAL EDITION

This is the final edition of The
Ring-tum Phi for the 1974-75
academic year. Because _ this
issue will be mailed to incom-
ing freshmen during the sum-
mer, several articles pertaining
exclusively to those students have
been printed. Further, the pic-
torial essay on pages 3 and 4
has been included as a review
for those who will be graduating
and as an overview of sorts for
those who arrive in Lexington
for the first time in September.

Linens touted in letter

to parents of freshmen

Dear Parents:

The University Supply Store
offers a very convenient Rental
Linen Service for students living
in the dormitories. Since this
service has been most satisfactory
for many years, we would like
to invite your son to take ad-
vantage of its proven benefits in
the coming academic year.

We are sending this informa-
tion to you because in the past
it has been confused with other
linen services offered here in the
community. We would like to
impress upon you that THIS IS

THE ONLY LINEN SERVICE
AUTHORIZED BY THE UNI-
VERSITY.

The Rental Service consists of
a complete change of thoroughly
sterilized linens—two sheets, one
pillow slip, and three bath towels,
exchanged weekly, and one ray-
on blanket which will be cleaned
during the Christmas holidays.
The cost of this service for the
entire school year is $42.00 (plus
$1.68 Virginia sales tax). If the
blanket is not needed, the other
items are available for $37.00

Hlave you ever noticed the way
WeL appears misty and hallowed
in the evening, almost like a na-
tional shrine? Even the lowly
to the Quad takes o
an eerie appearance, as the pic-
ture at the top of the page shows.

The mists and other phenomena
cause unusual effects to occur
within the crania of WoL gentle-

men, and some poor souls take

to contemplating such deeply
philosophical questions as the
purpose and psychic individu-

ality of an egg. Others attempt
to achieve free fligitt in heavier-

than-air vehicles, and smash
into heavier-than-air inanimate
obiects. Of course, there are
those who behave in a normal

collegiate manner, spending their
time engaged in polo matches
and swim meets, as portrayed by
the gentlemen at left, or party-
ing the hours away, as Jess

newspaper, demonstrates with a
young lady he happened to meet

Generals seeded in NCAA playoff

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
team earned its fourth straight
invitation to the NCAA champ-
ionship tournament by winning
its final three games, including
a 9-5 decision last Saturday over
arch-rival Virginia.

The Generals under Coach
Jack Emmer were ranked eighth
and played at top-seeded Johns
Hopkins, the defending national

JV Lacrosse
ends its season
with a win

After dropping four of their
first five games, Washington

and Lee’s jayvee lacrosse team
rallied with three straight wins
to record a .500 season.

In the final two weeks of their
campaign the jayvees posted a
lacrosse rarity by shutting out
Virginia Military, 12-0; came
close three days later in a 14-2
win over the Norfolk Lacrosse
Club; then closed out the year

with a 9-5 win over the Roa-
noke L.C,
Coach Bill Hoatson’s fresh-

man attack trio of Gary Carp-
entier, Jim Roselle, and Rich
Grace carried most of the scor-
ing load in the three wins.

Carpentier picked up nine
goals in the last three games,
including four against Norfolk.
Roselle had four goals and seven
assists, including a two and four
performance against Norfolk,
while Grace had five goals and
eight assists, with a three and
four game against VMI.

Midfielder Pete Farren also
contributed five goals over the
final three games.

The shutout over VMI re-
venged a 7-6 loss suffered earlier
in the year. W&L led 8-0 at half-
time, and the Keydets never
threatened any of the Generals’
three goalies in the second half.

W&L came within two minutes
of repeating a whitewash against
Norfolk, but the visitors got a
pair of shots by third-team goalie
Harry Mazaheri to avoid a shut-
out.

champions, Wednesday at 4:00
p.m. It was the third time in
the past four years W&L has
traveled to Hopkins for a champ-
ionship game.

The Blue Jays defeated W&L
11-5 in a 1972 quarter final
game, and edged the Generals,
11-10, in last year’s semi-finals
game en route to the national

championship.
“We're just delighted to be in
the tournament,” said Coach

Emmer, whose young team over-
came early season injuries and
inexperience to post an overall
10-6 record. W&L defeated Roa-
noke, Rutgers and Virginia in its
last three games after earlier de-
feating the no. 1-ranked college
division team, Towson.

W&L lost early season games
to two other tournament par-
ticipants: no. 3-ranked Navy and
no. 5 Mofstra, while defeating no.
7-ranked Rutgers.

‘We are looking forward to re-
turning to Homewood Field and
playing Johns Hopkins,’ Emmer
said. “Last year’s game was an
excellent lacrosse game, and this
one should be too.”

Junior attackman Rob Morgan,
who scored four goals, and the
tight W&L defense were the key
factors in the victory over
fourth-ranked Virginia.

Morgan scored twice as W&L
took a 5-1 lead at the half,
tallied his third to give the Gen-
erals a 7-2 margin in the third
quarter, and then scored the
final goal of the game to clinch
W&L’s third straight victory over
Virginia. Attackman Don Carroll
and midfielder Jay Sindler each
had a pair of goals, and All-
American Dave Warfield had one
despite playing with a cast over
his broken thumb.

Morgan leads the Generals in
goals scored, with a regular sea-
son total of 51. Warfield has
tallied 35, while Carroll has
found the back of the net on
36 occasions.

W&L’s defense, led by goalie
Charlie Brown and defensemen
Tommy Keigler, Rob Lindsey
and John Strock shut out the
Cavaliers until just 1:33 remain-
ed in the first half. Brown re-
corded 17 saves, 11 of them in
the second half and many of
them of the spectacular variety,
to thwart Virginia’s comeback
bid.

The winner of Wednesday's
W&L-Hopkins game will find as
its opponent in the playoffs the
winner of the Maryland-Hofstra
game, on Saturday, May 24 at
either College Park, Md. o
Hempstead, N.Y.

Wé&L’s John Embree may seek
a professional tennis career

When he enrolled at Washing-
ton and Lee four years ago, John
Embree “was just hoping I could
make the tennis team.”

Today, he has such a success-
ful record that he is considering
a professional career.

“T’'d like to give it a shot,” said
Embree. “I feel that I am just
starting to reach my potential.”

Embree capped off his out-
standing collegiate career this
spring by winning the no. 1
singles of the Virginia College
Athletic Association Tournament,
in which all of Virginia's smaller
colleges compete. Embree defeat-
ed Hampton Institute's Roger de
Santis Guedes, one of the better
players in the Mid-Atlantic area
who has played in several World
Championship Tennis qualifying
events, and was invited by Mary-
land’s John Lucas to be his
doubles partner. Embree won in
Straight sets, 6-4, 6-4.

Although Hampton swept the
other five singles and all three

doubles events, Embree was
voted the VCAA “Outstanding
Player.” In his senior year,

Embree posted a 20-7 record at
no. 1 singles and led the Gen-
erals to an 18-6 team record.

For his four-year career, Em-
bree compiled a 72-26 mark in
Singles and 49-21 in doubles. He
played the no. 3 position as a
freshman, no. 2 as a sophomore
and no. 1 the past two years,
serving as team captain his senior
year.

“I want to play in a let of
tournaments this summer and
see if I can make a name for
myself,” Embree said recently.
He has had a summer job for
the past several years teaching
tennis at a country club near
Washington, D.C. (River Bend
Golf and Country Club at Great
Falls), and he'd like to find a
fulltime job as a professional at
an indoor club.

With that as a home base
Embree hopes to play in many
of the “satellite” tournaments
held in connection with the ma-
Jor Association of Tennis Pro-
fessional (ATP) events.

Embree's strongest part of his

game is his booming serve, al-
though “I’ve been disappointed
with it this year.’ To compensate,
he’s been working on his volley
(“the best part of my game
now’) and return of serve (‘the
most improved’’).

At 6’-2", Embree has the serve
advantage all tall tennis players
possess.

A native of Hinsdale, Ill., on
the outskirts of Chicago, Embree
was introduced to the game at
the age of 6 by his father, whom
he describes as “an excellent
player.” “I took part in a very
good junior development pro-
gram and was involved in clinics
and area tournaments” until age
14.

But Embree says he never took

his tennis seriously in high school
or at Deerfield Academy prep
school, and “when I chose to
come to W&L, I was just looking
for a good academic school and
hoping I could make the team.
I also wanted to play soccer.”
Embree is a four-year letterman
in soccer.

W&L tennis coach Dennis Bus-
sard thinks Embree “has an ex-
cellent chance” to make it as a
pro. “He has good strokes, and
he has what it takes to be tough
on the tennis court. He has ma-
turity, mental toughness and the
ability to concentrate very well.”

Bussard says his star player
“has enough of those qualities
that he will be a success in what-
ever he attempts.”

WésL Alumni loses
to Varsity Football

Quarterback Jack Berry threw
two touchdown passes and a pair
of conversions to lead the Varsity
to an 18-6 football victory over
Washington and Lee's Alumni
last Saturday.

Berry completed scoring tosses
of eight yards to John Moore
and 12 yards to Mark George,
and passed twice to George for
conversions. For the day, the
rising senior quarterback from
Madison completed 11 of 18
passes for 186 yards, good for
16 points.

cates. The first half ended with
the Alumni on the Varsity one-
yard line, and the Old Grads
drove to the Varsity two-yard
line late in the game before
a fumbled snap cost them the
ball.

Baizley completed 12 of 19
passes for 97 yards and one
touchdown—a 13-yard strike to
Chappy Conrad—and rushed for
another 60 yards.

For the Varsity, running backs
Peter Abitante and Ray Scott
ground out 77 yards.

THE RING-TUM PHI

The incredible lacrosse

match against Hopkins

(Continued from page 1)
Generals was a Warfield to Lar-
son combination. Larson was
standing 10 yards in front of the
goal.

With the score 3-0 W£&aL,
Hopkins began to question it-
self. There were a series of
Hopkins time-outs to re-group.
But for the rest of the after-
noon the Blue Jays could not
answer their own question.

Saturday the boys from Lex-
ington will again be underdogs
and again play in Maryland. This
time W&L will face the Uni-
versity of Maryland, in a game
to be broadcast by WLUR. Mary-
land too has stopped Hopkins
this year, 19 to 11. The Generals
will come up against a powerful
defensive squad; however, the
coaches feel that W&L will be
able to control the tempo of the
game. If that is true we could
possibly be in store for our first
National Championship game,
but as one player said, “Even if
we don’t win we are going to keep
the Big Boys honest this year.”

DeChristopher’s Prospero challenged

(Continued from page 1)

ances, such as the rapid-fire
repartee with Antonio (Frank
Friedman) and Sebastion (John
Ellis), in Act two, scene one;
he never failed to amuse the
audience with his depiction of
Gonzalo’s idealism ad nauseum.
Mr. Burch was constantly in-
novative and Gonzalo did not be-
come as boring to the audience
as he is to the usurping Dukes,
which is the case in many pro-
ductions of The Tempest. In con-
trast, John Ellis was largely un-
innovative, and rarely mustered
more than a sneer to substanti-
ate the evil nature of his role
as Sebastion.

The only one of the major
characters about whom I had
any serious reservations was
Prospero. Quite appropriately,
David DeChristopher ascertain-
ed Prospero as a moody scholar
and a necromancer. He seemed
to miss, however, the power
which his role deserves. Further-
more, the moodiness of Prospero

comes not only from a studious,
or ascetic nature, but also from
a brooding desire for revenge
against his brother. Development
of this vindictive spirit through-
out the play is imperative if his
eventual forgiveness is to achieve
a sufficient denouement, yet
Mr. DeChristopher’s Prospero
seemed to show little significant
change from beginning to end.
Despite this problem, the very
evenness of Mr. DeChristopher’s
performance was perhaps a
virtue in disguise, for his poise
and experience as an actor com-
bined to give the play a good
solidity.

Of the minor characters, Rob
Mish's Stephano should be com-
mended above all others. His
Napoleanic costume and grandi-
ose gestures served perfectly to
suggest the inclinations of a
“drunken butler’ with absurd
illusions of grandeur. Stephano’s
boon compaions, Trinculo and
Caliban, were played by Hugh
Sisson and Paul Richards. While
he came up with the right air of

buffoonery, Mr. Sisson had dif-
ficulty in deciding which English
accent he would use. Mr. Rich-
ard’s Caliban was certainly
despicable, but was not hateful
enough. Like so many other
actors, Paul abjured much of the
evil in Caliban in favor of a
sympathetic interpretation.

If I have seemed overly didac-
tic in this critique, it is only
because I respect The Tempest
above all but a select few of
the plays that I have ever seen
or read. The University Theatre's
production, despite my objection
to the one scene, is a mirthful
and thoroughly enjoyable theatre
experience. It is assuredly the
finest production of the year.
