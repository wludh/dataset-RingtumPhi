Physical, Academic Change
Marks 219th College Year

A new president, a new dean, two
new department heads and one new
building were on hand when Wash-
ington and Lee University opened
its 219th academic year Sept. 20,

A record 1,456 students—the first
time the University’s enrollment has
ever topped 1,400—began registering
Monday.

The new president is Dr. William
W. Pusey, HI, who has been named
acting president, effective Sept. 1,
until a new president is selected to
succeed Dr. Fred C. Cole. (See re-
lated story on page 2.) Dr. Cole,
Washington and Lee president since
1959, resigned to accept the presi-
dency of the Council on Library
Resources in Washington, D. C.

Ihe new dean is Robert E. R.
Huntley, who became dean of the
School of Law, on September | suc-

ceeding Charles P. Light, Jr. Dean
Light retired Aug, 21 as dean, but
remains professor of law and will
continue to teach full time.

The new department heads are Dr.
Emory Kimbrough, Jr., sociology,
and Lt. Col. Everett C. Royal, military
science.

Only Col. Royal will be a stranger
to the students. Dr. Pusey, a mem-
ber of the W&L faculty since 1930,
will continue in his present position
as Dean of the College, a post he
has held since 1960, Prof. Huntley,
a Washington and Lee alumnus,
joined the law faculty in 1958, and
Dr. Kimbrough began his W&L teach-
ing duties in 1962,

Col. Royal and his staff will occupy

the newest addition to the W&L
campus, a $70,000 steel-sided and

cinderblock structure which will house
the military department and also the

University’s building and grounds
offices.
The Reserved Officer's Training

Corps (ROTC) will occupy the entire
main floor of the building, which will
have nine offices or work rooms, two
classrooms and a training aids room.
The military department also will

use half of the basement for its arms
and uniform storage area, while build-
ings and grounds will use the other

 

half for its offices, a mailing room
and storage space.
New Innovations

Innovations for the students
rolling at Washington and Lee in-
clude a new grade system, a new
option to take certain courses on a
“pass-fail” basis, and possibly the last
of the traditional “early” rush weeks,
when fraternities seek new members
during the first week of school.

The new grade system is a switch
from the former 3.0 scale to a 4.0
scale in “grade-point ratios.” Students
will continue to receive letter grades,
A through F. The 4,0 system is in-
creasingly becoming standard at most
colleges and universities.

Beginning this year as a_ trial,
WAL juniors and seniors may take
one elective course each semester on
a “pass-fail” basis, where no letter
grade will be given. The system is
designed to encourage students to
undertake more difficult courses while
lessening the hazard of a low grade
pulling down their overall academic
average.

Washington and Lee's [8 social fra-
ternities completed their traditional
“rush” for new members this week,
but it may be the last time they will
do so before fall classes start. A
strongly-worded faculty resolution in
May requested the students to draw
up a plan of deferred rush to be
implemented in the Fail of 1968.
Under such a system, rushing prob-
ably would be deferred at least until
the end of the first semester.

fhe final figures of rush will be
released next week after freshmen
accept fraternity bids tonight between
8 and 10,

The expected record enrollment of
1,456 compares with last year's total
figure of 1,386, and includes 358 fresh-
men, 888 upperclassmen and 218 in
the School of Law. The biggest in-
crease (approximately 65) is in the
number of upperclassmen returning,
along with several more transfer and
foreign students. The law school and
freshmen figures are very close to last
year s.

Looking in Books Is
Breach of Honor Code

Prompted by several contro-
versial honor trials, the Executive
Committee last spring adopted the
policy of expelling any student
found looking into a book or note-
book during a test or exam, unless
it can be proved that he was not
cheating.

Student Body President Richard
Nash said that in past honor trial
cases, students have been caught
looking in books or notebooks,
but the EC has been unable to
prove definitely that the student
had received aid from them,

The proposal was passed by the
newly-elected EC in a planning
session last spring,

W&L Gets Federal Grant
For College Library Study

Washington and Lee University
received a grant of $75,000 this sum-
mer from the U. S. Office of Educa-
tion to study the impact of modern
technology on small college libraries.

The study, which will continue
through mid-December 1968, is aimed
at identifying the critical problems of
small college and community college
libraries and finding solutions to them
through efficient and economical ap-
plication of the latest technical inno-
vations and equipment.

Dr. Edward F. Turner, professor
of physics and head of the depart-
ment, is the principal investigator.
He is a member of the University’s
library committee and has been a
consultant on library problems to the
Ford Foundation. In this connection,
he has personally consulted with uni-
versity and public libraries, industrial

producers of library equipment and |

library researchers across the country.

The focus of the study will be on
building an optimum library for the
liberal arts college. Particular atten

tion will be given to the application |

of microfilm methods of storage and
to the use of computers to facilitate
access to the material. The ultimate

goal ts to improve overall service to 7

the library user.

Planned By Spring ’69

much more varied program of social
and recreational activities than at
present. Bids are now being asked
for the project, which entails com-
plete renovation of the present two-
story Student Union building and
erection of a new one-story structure
to link the Student Union with the
present Evans Dining Hall,

The expanded facility has been
made possible through two bequests
totaling more than $500,000, one
from Mrs. Annie Fielding Early of
Washington, D.C, and the other from
her daughter, Mrs. Annie Early Fair-
fax of Washington and Roanoke. Both
were friends and supporters of Wash-
ington and Lee for a number of years.

Many of the students’ extracur-
ricular and leisure activities will be
centered in the new structure when
it is completed in March, 1969, In-
cluded will be music rehearsal and
practice rooms, several meeting rooms
for the various student organizations,
a chapel and office for the University
chaplain, a large reception lounge, a
library and reading room, a tavern,
and rooms for television, billiards,
cards and ping pong.

The student body Executive Com-
mittee, which administers the student
government and the honor system,
also will have its meeting rooms in
the building.

The student center will be super-
vised by a director, a new position
to be filled at a later date. Space is
provided in the building for the di-
rector’s office.

The new structure will relieve a
pressing need to provide more and
better recreational and social facili-
ties for Washington and Lee students

A special student-faculty commit-
tee has been working for more than
a year planning what the building
would contain. Through polls and
discussions with the students, the com
mitiee sounded out their opinions
while working closely with Dean of
Students Edward C. Atwood, Jr. in
planning the new structure.

“Every consideration has been given
to providing, as far as practical, what
the students want in the way of a
student center,” Dean Atwood com-
mented,

The new facility was designed by

Nexsen & Owen of Lynchburg. A

THE RING-

TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Published by the Students of Washington and Lee
Friday, September 22, 1967

 

A Statement Of Policy

At various times in the past the Ring-tum Phi has been

accused of being inaccurate,

irreverent, and irresponsible;

biased, boring, and sensationalist; vulgar, unintellectual, and
downright trashy. As recently as last week the dean of students
told a crowd of freshmen at Freshman Camp that the Ring-tum
Phi is a “panic” publication put together in haste and inac-
curacy every Tuesday and Friday morning with whatever will
fill up four pages—and we suspect he was only half joking.

In fact, baiting the Ring-tum Phi seems to have become
as popular a faculty sport as handball (and more exciting,
since you never know when the Ring-tum Phi, unlike the

handball, will strike back.)

We have no intention of apologizing for ourselves and
our opinions. But it has been our observation that the articles
which bring the greatest number of complaints are those
written by columnists who are not reguarly affiliated with the
Ring-tum Phi staff. Such articles, for the benefit of freshmen
and professors new to W&L, usually consist of an opening
paragraph followed by 95 paragraphs on What’s Wrong With
WeL, and a concluding paragraph respectfully suggesting
the resignation of one or more presidents, deans, and assorted
student leaders. (We have frequently been accused of supply-
ing mimeographed, fill-in-the-blank forms for such opinion

pieces. This is quite untrue.)

In all seriousness, however, we feel that amid the monoton-
ous gray cloud of columns and letters to the editor there is
an occasional silver lining of intelligent and pertinent com-
ment, and that this comment should be encouraged to the full
as being one of the most basic functions of the Ring-tum Phi—
in spite of the various brickbats we may receive from some
quarters for doing so. We also feel that it is not the business
of our staff to judge what is intelligent and what is ridiculous
in this kind of article, leaving that to the readers’ individual

discretion and sense of humor.

With the above assumptions, we have established the
following policy with regard to the articles of opinion and
letters to the editor which appear on this page:

—All articles of opinion will be accepted for publication,

with the following reservations:

—Articles and letters to the editor must be signed, although
names may be withheld if requested.

—The Ring-tum Phi reserves the right to disassociate itself
from any opinions expressed in an article.

—Obscene or libelous material can not be accepted.

—Articles must be submitted well in advance of the de-

 

sired printing date.

21 New Faculty Members Added
As School Begins Fall Semester

Twenty-one new members have
been added to the faculty of Washing-
ton and Lee this fall including replace-
ments for professors on leave and
new additions.

The appointments include an as
sociate professor, two assistant pro-
fessors, 14 instructors, and four men
in the ROTC department, according
to Dr. W. W. Pusey, acting president.

A number of the instructors, Pusey

tion of their Ph.D. degrees.

Richard E. Szlasa, 31, instructor in
physical education, is the new lacrosse
coach replacing Dana Swan who fe-
signed to become football coach at
Haverford College. Szlasa, formerly

Dean Hotchkiss stated that the
“number of applications was down
this year. This reflects the growing
knowledge and ability of high school
college counselors who are thus more
able to produce a realistic application.
“This class is the first group from
the Korean Conflict baby boom, but
the total increase in applications is
being tempered by the directions of
the guidance counselors. Our ultimate
goal, after additional dorms are built
is 360 resident freshmen cach year;
we're very optimistic.”

president is selected and takes office.

Selection Committee

A selection committee of four

trustees, consulting with a faculty ad-

| visory committee and representatives

of the Alumni Board of Directors, will
work on the selecting of a new presi-
dent. Dr. John Newton Thomas of
Richmond, a trustee since 1938, is
chairman of the committee,

Dr. Pusey, 56, joined the W&L
faculty in 1939 as an associate pro-
fessor of German. He subsequently
became a full professor and head of

Dr. Pusey earned his B.S. degree
at Haverford College, an A.M. at
Harvard, and his Ph.D, at Columbia.
He has traveled in Europe and studied
in Bonn, Heidelberg, and Munster.

Dr. Pusey’s major study field has
been German impressionism, especi-
ally the writings of Eduard von

Interim President William W. Pusey III

Keyserling. Also specializing in
American-German literary relations,
he recently taught courses in Russian
and comparative literature at W&L.

Dr. Pusey has written two books,
“Louis-Sebastien Mercier in Ger-
many,” his doctoral thesis, published
in 1939, and “Readings in Military
German,” which he co-authored in
1943. The author of reviews and
articles in scholarly journals, he is a
regular contributor of book reviews
in “The Roanoke Times.”

Honorary Societies

V of the selection board for the
Woodrow Wilson National Fellow-
ships. He was a panelist at the Na-
tional Summer Conference for Aca-
demic Deans at Oklahoma State Uni-
versity in August, 1966.

Dr. Pusey is a former member of
the Lexington and Rockbridge County
school boards and a former president
of the area Community Chest drive.

During World War Il, Dr. Pusey
served 39 months in the U. §, Naval
Reserve. He left the service as a lieu-
tenant commander. He was cited for
his work as an interpreter in the
interrogation of the German Naval
Comand after the war.

Dr. Pusey was born in Wilmington,
Del. in 1910, the son of William W.
and Edith L. Pusey. He married Mary
Hope Smith in 1940. They have two
children, Mary Faith and Diana Enid

 

Pusey.

 

 

 

Letters To The Editor...

 

Alumnus vs. Visitors

7 Sept. 67
To The Editor of the Ring-tum Phi
Sir:

WAL’s board of visitors are once
again faced with the task of finding
a new president—one, hopefully, who
might stay at the job—and I would
like to submit some views for the
purpose at least of promoting some
thought on the matter. I write not
only as an alumnus whose roots are
deep in the university but as a news-
man with a superficial knowledge of
some of the trends within smaller
colleges across the country.

These suggestions are based on what{ Yale,

I would regard as two relevant facts:
the recent spread of junior colleges
across Virginia (and Florida) and,
further, on the burgeoning wealth
that has come in recent years to such

institutions as Harvard, MIT, Leland)

Stanford, etc.

No Competition

In a very real sense, WAL can't
hope to compete with either group.
A very great many highly talented
students who cannot afford W&L (or
Williams, or Dartmouth, or Princeton)
will go to junior colleges near their
homes—-and if they're talented
enough, get scholarships to Harvard,
MIT, ete.

This leads me to the
that WAL must become, and rather
quickly too, a broadly innovative cen-
ter of some particular field.

In order to find a man who can
develop a new academic atmosphere
in Lexington, the search, | believe,
should be conducted by a new and
far younger board of visitors. With
all due regard for the splendid service
that has been rendered by Mr. St
Clair and his colleagues, their best
service now would be to retire from
the fray and let younger men take on

their mission—certainly those of
them who have passed their 65th
year

| have no real hope this might

happen unless there is a wide accept-
ance of the theory and this can only
action within alumni
groups and on the campus and the
only way this can be activated is if
the Alumni Bulletin will carry this
letter to WAL's alumni groups

“Authentic Scholars”

If a younger
board—unencumbered by
of WAL's “traditions” that belong in
history books (the last time they were
uprooted by Robert Edward
Lee)—the search bold young
man might be extended beyond the
borders of the Confederacy. Treason?
No, il with WAL's old boast
of being the most “cosmopolitan

Southern colleges. There are, I submit,
men who are authentic schloars—
fund-raisers too—beyond the Old
Dominion.

Finally, | would think if some
daring young man were found, he
might seek a “congress” of presidents
of colleges comparable to W&L which,
over a period of not-too-many-years,
might assign to each some major
spheres offered by Harvard, MIT,
Leland Stanford, ete.

Joke?

With all due and warm regard for
my old friend, Charlie Light, I sub-
mit it as something close to a joke
that W&L would believe it can com-
pete with the law schools of Harvard,

 

conclusion |

the University of Virginia,
Duke, etc. When I say that I bear in

imind the hallowed memories of such

luminaries as John W. Davis, Newton
Baker, Herbert Fitzpatrick, etc., ad
ad, of our law school.

Let's begin now to concentrate upon

| a single field in which WAL will rate,

not in atmosphere which, God spare
us, is passe, but in scholarship.

I suspect this will fall upon the
deaf ears of Mr. St. Clair and of
others. It might, conceivably, blow.
up a little dust. And where there's
dust, there's a road.

I invite other alumni and students
to begin discussing this question and
to write the Alumni News, or to
members of the board their views on
how the university may or must now
orient itself to a situation in which
it is woefully out of date.

 

Sincerely,
Duncan G. Groner

35-0 To Tough Guilford 11

This first article must report a very
disappointing beginning to the Gen-
erals 1967 season—a very sharp Guil-
ford College eleven defeated W&L
35-0. Things were at sixes and sevens
all day last Saturday, as W&L allowed
a 76-yard touchdown punt return,
threw three passes that were inter-
cepted, and failed to tackle properly
time and again.

In spite of W&L’s performance, the
coaching staff singled out for praise
the punting of senior co-captain Rudd
Smith, a Summerville, S. C. native
who kicked for a 46.0 average for
nine punts; and senior fullback Bill
McDavid; sophomore fullback Phil
Jones; sophomore quarterback Chuck
Kuhn; senior co-captain tackle Phil
Thompson; and sophomore end Pete
Piltz for their offensive efforts. On de-
fense, mention went to sophomore
halfback John Nolan, who ran back
a 25-yard pass interception; junior
end Ken Long; junior linebacker Fran
Lawrence; junior tackle Britt Me-
Junkin; and sophomore linebacker
Dean Kumpuris.

W&L took 60 players to Greens-
boro, N. C., including eight fresh-

Designates

Openings Committees

By BOBBY YEVICH

Dean Kumpuris, president of the
sophomore class and of Openings
Weekend, has mamed twenty vice-
presidents to assist him in making

arrangements for Openings. Kumpuris
chose one Openings Vice-President

from each fraternity and two inde- |

pendent Vice-Presidents,

Kumpuris and Homer Gamble, the
sophomore class vice-president, select-
ed this unusually large number of
vice-presidents so that all elements of
the class would be represented. In
the past few years the number of
Openings Vice-Presidents has usually
been lower than six, and each vice-
president picked students to fill his
committee. Naturally, some fraterni-
ties had no members on any of the
committees. But this year, Kumpuris
has organized his twenty vice-presi-
dents into three full committees.

Cocktail Party

The cocktail party will take place
from 4 to 6 on Friday afternoon of
Openings Weekend. However, the
location, liquor, and entertainment for
the Cocktail party will not be decided
until later this week. The theme for
decorating the gym for the dance will
also be decided this week,

Dr. Tucker's tenure as dean was
marked by a steady improvement in
admissions requirements and instruct-
ional standards. Although he never
sought public office, his career was
notable for its contribution to state
governmeninial function in the field
of education,

Taxation Authority

He was recognized as an authority
on taxation and governmental struc-
ture, and served as the first chair-
man of Virginia's Industrial Develop-
ment Commission (1918-1919) and as
the first chairman of the state Com-
mission on County Government (1930-

 

1932).

new Student Union would not be com-
pleted until March of 1969 the faculty
may decide to allow the present rush
system to remain in effect for another
year,

Senior law student Stafford Keegin,
Contact chairman, said that although
Goldwater would probably be con-
tracted for $2,500, the cost would be
well worth the publicity,

Keegin said that other political
figures and columnists were under con-
sideration to be invited to speak.
Ihe theme of the program will be
“What is the Republican Party?”

Although the faculty soundly passed
a resolution last year in which it
instructed the IFC to defer rush week
until after the first or second semester,
it is felt that many of the faculty
so voted in the belief that the new
Student Union would be completed
by September of 1968.

But the bids were just accepted,
and work will not start until this
winter. The complex is not expected
to be completed until late in the
1968-69 school year. So some chance
remains that the faculty will amend
its resolution to give the IFC one

more year in which to adopt deferred
rush,
The IFC stressed that under the

new rules for pledge training adopted
last year, no work of any sort may
be required of any pledge. Exceptions
to this rule are the memorization of
chapter and national history and
songs, the construction of Homecom-
ing displays, and school-oriented study
halls.

After mid-semester, only those
pledges with 1.5 or better on the
four-point system will be allowed to
attend work days and such. Also,
the IFC has abolished all forms of
Hell Week, Help Week, or any re-
lated forms of activity.

292 Pledged Dur ¢ Record Rush Week

A record 286 freshmen pledged
fraternities at the end of Rush Week.
That number represented 81 per cent
of the freshman class, the highest
percentage since 1961, Three junior
transfers, two sophomores and an ex-
change student also pledged.

Pi Phi and Lambda Chi had the
highest number of pledges with 21,

Virtue Versus Vice

Now that Washington and Lee has completed what may or
may not be its last before-classes-begin Rush Week, the Ring-
tum Phi is obliged by tradition to conduct a post-mortem, be-
fore the memory fades too much. It might, therefore, be
appropriate to look at one of the clumsiest, most unenforceable
and most seemingly impractical of all Rush Week regulations—
as an example of the type thing that by merely being on the
books sullies the mame of the Inter-Fraternity Council and
contributes to the IFC’s low batting average of enforcement—
the so-called “dirty rush rule”:

“No fraternity man may use any criticism of any other
fraternity, or its constituent members, in order to build
up his fraternity or to discredit the other fraternity.”

Most houses dirty rush and admit it without reluctance,
at least privately. We know of one house (there may be more)
which had its own no-dirty-rush rule, voted into effect by its
membership, with a $25 house fine for violators. We also
know, however, of at least six houses whose members acknowl-
edge having dirty-rushed at least once this Rush Week. Dirty-
rush “teams” are not unknown. Dirty rush over the summer
is blatant, and probably universally engaged in.

There is, we think, a valid question as to the need for a
dirty-rush rule to even appear on the books. Some opponents
of the rule feel that unlimited dirty rush would in the long
run cancel itself out from house to house. More reasonably,
it can be suggested that dirty rush by a house might just serve
to indicate to a freshman the character of the dirty rusher. No
freshman, we think, would respect an irrational slanderer—and
we would be willing to give W&L-calibre freshmen credit for
generally being perceptive enough to discern what is a legiti-
mate observation and what is not. Certain forms of what is
now considered “dirty rush” could even be of benefit to a
rushee—for example, a frank comparison of house bills, nam-
ing fraternity names and dollar amounts, with a student whose
finances are tight.

It was Bernard Shaw who said “Any vice that cannot be
suppressed should be made a virtue.” While nobody wants to
exalt dirty rush, or make a recumbent statue of it, perhaps
it’s time—particularly with the very real possibility of “Rush
Week” becoming “Rush Semester” in the next few years—to
begin accepting it for what it is: inevitable, and capable of
being seen by nearly everybody for what it is.

DIRTY RUSH

cRESHMAN IGNORANCE of PUsy

 
   

 

By RICHARD H. NASH
President of the Student Body

I have been asked by the editor
of the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi to write
an article outlining the Executive
Committee's expected goals in the
coming nine months. But this is some-
thing that neither | nor anyone else
can predict with any accuracy because
the Committee is composed of 12
members, each member having an
equal vote. Consequently, what is
done or not done during this year
cannot be guaranteed by any one
person.

 

 

Four Honorary
Degrees Given
At Graduation

Retired Gen. Lucius D. Clay was
among four distinguished Americans
presented honorary degrees during
Washington and Lee's 218th com-
mencement in June.

The University also conferred
honorary degrees on Princeton Uni-
versity Professor Whitney J. Oates,
Roanoke, Va., newspaper publisher
M. W. Armistead II], and Leesburg,
Va. attorney Wilbur C. Hall.

Prof. Oates received the Doctor of
Letters degree, while the other three
were presented th Doctor of Laws
degree. The degrees were conferred
on the men by University President
Fred C, Cole, who delivered the
commencement address,

Distinguished Americans
Gen. Clay. who is now a senior
partner of Lehman Brothers in New
York, was cited for both his 31
years of distinguished military service

 

7 and his economic leadership, begun

with his retirement from the Army
in 1949,

The citation noted Gen, Clay's “de-
termination and calm perseverance”
in dealing with the Berlin Blockade
while he was commander-in-chief of
American forces in Europe and mili-
tary governor of the U. S. Zone in
Germany, and again during the Berlin
Wall crisis of 1961 when, as Presi-
Kennedy's special envoy, he
inspired “the people of West Berlin
in their renewed struggle for freedom
and security.”

Prof, Oates was cited “as a teacher
of superior ability (and)... as a
national educator,” Dr, Oates is pro-
fessor of humanities at Princeton, and
was instrumental in establishing the
Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship
Foundation, the National Foundation
for the Arts and Humanities,

Reporter to Publisher
Armistead, who rose from reporter
to publisher and chief executive of
Times-World Corp., which operates
two Roanoke daily newspapers, a
radio station and television station,

labor in behalf of his community, his
state and his country” and for his
“talent, initiative, enthusiasm, (and)
a remarkable ability to accomplish
the difficult task. ‘

Hall's citation termed him “a
lawyer's lawyer” and said “few mem-
bers of the legal profession are
so generally admired and respected,”
An alumnus of Washington and Lee,
Hall was cited as “author and spon-
sor of far-sighted legislation” during
his 18-year term (1918-35) as a mem-
ber of the Virginia House of Dele-
gates, and as a “wise counsellor,
learned scholar (and) devoted public

 

servant,”

 

 

was cited for a “a life of unselfish |

 

E.C. President Presents Issues
Facing The School This Year

What I can do, however, is to point
out many of the issues that I will
personally pursue, or have pursued,
for presentation to the Committee for
some form of action.

Before listing any specific items,
however, I would like to say that I
am sure this year’s Committee will be
much more mindful of student opin-
ion than those Committees of recently
past years. Hopefully, we will all be
able to vote in a manner that repre-
sents the way in which the majority
of the students would vote. This may
not be possible at all times, but we
will make an attempt to do so as
much as we can.

Probably the most pressing problem
that we will confront will concern
laying down certain “ground rules”
involving the Honor System. This does
not mean that we are going to list
and formalize basic rules, but that
there is a need for students and pro-
fessors to communicate better with
each other about what each “side”
considers cheating. This is especially

a problem in the language and math, |

departments.

One of the most important pieces

of legislation that we shall take up
will be the establishment of a more
flexible examination schedule. Each
semester, many students work hard
and do well in a course for four to
five months. Then, during the exam
period, often all is lost because exams
are crammed into a few days. With
a little time and effort, a new system
can be worked out which will alleviate
this problem and will add no extra
days to the examination period,
Another important piece of legisla-
tion to be looked into is the separa-
tion of the School of Law and the
undergraduate schools in certain
phases of student government. Most
law students desire such separation

 

 

because they are not only uninterested
in most of the undergraduate con-
cerns, but also becuse it is also
ridiculous for twenty-four-year-old
law students to be disciplined by nine-
teen-year-old sophomores.

Not so pressing, although it could
become quite beneficial, would be the
establishment of a “press gallery” at
E.C, meetings. This might include a
representative from each fraternity,
one from the Gaines Society, and one
from each law school class. The repre-

 

 

RICHARD NASH

sentatives would attend E.C. meetings
in a “reporter” type of fashion. They
would not participate in the meeting,
but would take notes on all debates,
recording good and bad points on all
issues. Then they would report to
their respective houses, classes, et
cetera, in order to educate the stu-

New Religious
Group To Ally
Work Projects

The newly organized University
Federation of Christian Concern is a
combined effort of the campus de-
nominations to cater to all sorts of
religious interests, Its flexible pro-
gram will include theological discus-
sion and service projects, as well as
programs of a social nature.

The structure of the organization
has been arranged so it can afford
to be comprehensive and flexible with-
out sacrificing an effective organiza-
tion. This has been accomplished by
assigning a denominational chaplain
as advisor to each permanent project,
thereby guaranteeing a sense of con-
tinuity which earlier religious organi-
zations lacked.

These advisors will keep a record
on their projects’ activities, while the
students will be running the show
themselves. The students will thus
have a source of information not
available before.

 

The UFOCC will have a meet-
ing of all interested upperclassmen
Thursday night at 8:30 in the Stu-
dent Union,

 

To be highlighted in this year’s pro-
gram will be intercollegiate forums
and two discussion programs: one
aimed at freshmen, the second at
upperclassmen.

Intercollegiate Activities

The intercollegiate forums are usu-
ally informal meetings involving
W&L and one of the nearby girls’
schools. The guest school will be
treated to dinner following which the
students will go to the chaplain’s home
to discuss some topic of contempor-
ary interest.

Occasionally these discussions will
be more elaborate. For example, last
year Hollins invited W&L and several
other men’s schools to see and
discuss a film on the church's role
in civil rights. Hollins also has a
coffee house open on weekends to
students who wish to discuss sub-
jects not merely of a religious nature
though this project is under the
auspices of their religious association.
The W&L fellowship is very interested
in the possibility of such a project
for this campus.

Discussion Program

The freshmen this year will have
the unique opportunity of a discussion
program led by three area clergymen,
Tom Brown of the Episcopal Church,
Charles Swezey of the Presbyterian,
and Father Carl Reikowsky of the
Roman Catholic. This exposure will
prepare the way for a similar pro-
gram aimed at upperclassmen,

Led by Dean David Sprunt and
Dr. Louis Hodges of the WAL relig-
ion department, and Mr. Swezey, it
will be essentially a series of seminars
for the higher-level W&L religion
courses and will set the stage for
various speakers who have agreed to
come to W&L this year.

The first speaker scheduled is
Joseph Fletcher, one of the theo-
logians behind the “New Morality,”

Doremus Natatorium Cesling

Replaced Over The Summer

The Doremus Natatorium has un-|
dergone extensive renovation over
the summer. The freshmen will now
make their jump for life in a freshly
painted and scrubbed pool.

The most noticable improvement
is a new acoustical ceiling—the third
ceiling the pool has seen. Its first
ceiling was a concrete affair that one
day caved in due to the moisture from
the pool below and the pounding of
the handball court above.

The second ceiling was of tin and

soon became very rusted, as any
swimmer can testify. The pool now
sports an acoustical ceiling which is
four feet lower than the previous tin
ceiling. Coach Twombly hopes that
this ceiling will last for the duration
of the life of Doremus Gym, now
entering its S3rd year.

Other improvements to the pool
include a fresh coat of paint, re-tiling
of the rotted areas of the spectator
balcony, and new window sills which
have been ordered and delivery is
expected in October. A new $700
electric clock has been ordered and
is expected to arrive in November.

The pool itself has been scrubbed
down and the water is in the best
condition that has been seen for many
years. Nevertheless, while the pool
seems brand new, it is still only 23 1/2
yards long.

W&L Generals Face R-M
Yellow Jackets Saturday |

This Saturday the Washington and
Lee Generals will appear in their first
home game of the season against the
Yellow Jackets of Randolph-Macon,
Randolph-Macon is a formidable op-
ponent with 25 returning lettermen
under the guidance of Coach Ted
Berry, now entering his fourth year as
head coach at Randolph-Macon.

The Yellow Jackets’ strong players
are junior quarterback Dave Wetzel
and halfbacks Dennis Toth and Hank
Fien. Wetzel, last season, rushed for
290 yards, completed 72 out of 138
passes for 892 yards and 7 touch-
downs, Toth ended up as R-M’s lead-
ing ground gainer a year ago, getting
526 yards on 121 carries, and caught
14 passes for 122 yards. Fien, on the
other hand, didn’t play as frequently,
but still gained 167 yards on 22 car-
ries, in addition to catching 8 passes
for 132 yards and scoring 24 points.

The Jackets had a 7-1-1 record last
year losing only to Hampden-Sydney
who the Generals had battled to a

3-3 tie. Washington and Lee has no-
where to go but up in this upcoming
contest. The Yellow Jackets have kept
the Generals scoreless in the last
three encounters.

The Generals can always look back
to that glorious day, not too long ago,
in 1916 when they squashed the Yel-
low Jackets 80-0. In the 17 games
between these two teams Washington
and Lee has the definite advantage
with 12 victories opposed to 4 losses
and | tie.

The Generals with more depth and
talent than last year can be expected
to give the Randolph-Macon Yellow
Jackets a tough game.

Delt Makes Sweet Briar Date
After 38-Mile Ride On Bicycle

By BERNIE FELD

Ever since Robert E. Lee seduced
Mary Custis, a Lexington townie, in
a shady grove on the site where Lee
Chapel now stands, W&L men have
traditionally had a reputation for
going to great length in pursuit of
the opposite sex,

A new pinnacle, however,
reached last Saturday when with
dogged, gutty and somewhat sweaty
determination, a Washington and Lee
sophomore rode a borrowed bicycle
from Lexington to Sweet Briar, Va.

Justin “Me and My Bike” Adams,
a Delt from Bristol, Va., set out from
the Delt house at | p.m. after a
bon voyage party.

Four hours and 38 miles later he
pedalled through the gates of that
haven of southern womanhood, a
trifle weary but his pioneer spirit un-
daunted,

In an exclusive interview, Adams
told the Ring-tum Phi, “I just thought
of the idea and left a few hours later.”

After arriving at Sweet Briar, he

Fraternity Pledging Rules
Will Stress ‘Good Taste’

(Editor's Note: The  Interfra-

, mendation

to the Student Affairs

fernity Council has issued the fol- | Committee of temporary or perma-

lowing directive which clarifies the

acceptable pledging programs for

fraternities.)

No fraternity shall violate the basic
principles of good taste, and a Fra-
ternity will initiate no activity which
will be detrimental to the reputation

of the Washington and Lee Com-
munity.
No initiation or pledge training

activity shall constitute any physical
or emotional hazard to the individual.
Such potential hazards include danger-
ous physical exertion or exhaustion,
physical violence, padling, and other
types of obvious abuse. It is under-
stood that the fraternities will exercise
no jurisdiction over the pledges dur-
ing the following hours: after 11:00
p.m., between 8:25 am. and 1:00
p.m., or while any regular academic
work is scheduled.

No Pledge training or initiation
activities will take place outside the
corporate limits of Lexington with
the exception of such functions
a formal initiation banquet or service
to the Community.

There shal Ibe no required pledging
activities such as line-ups, rallies, wake

until after mid-semester grades are
released. The only exceptions to this
are meals at the fraternity houses,
pledge meetings, and social activities.

Freshmen may participate in build-
ing homecoming displays after the
fraternities have obtained permission
from the IFC. In addition it is all
right for freshmen pledges to learn
chapter history, national history and
songs. Study halls for academics may
also be held.

At midsemester any rushee not hav-
ing a LS or better grade-point ratio
automatically becomes an inactive
pledge. An inactive pledge shall not
be required to participate in any fra-
ternity activities whatsoever. Any in-
active pledge who does not have a
1.5 or better grade-point ratio at the
end of semester is automatically
depledged and may not repledge until
he achieves a 1.5 at midsemester or
the end of a semester.

Any active pledge who fails to make

Putting An End To Drama

The Faculty Gets A Chance To Stop Playing Villain

Those who think that all the world’s a stage are likely to
have seen some comic flaws this week in our local scenario of
events at W&L.

Until now, everything about the question of deferring
rush week until the beginning or end of second semester has
followed the best dramatic rules. After appropriate rumblings
of discontent last fall as a prologue, the faculty chorus last
spring called upon the IFC to draw up plans by November
1967 for a deferred rush in 1968-69. The deadlines lent a
properly menacing atmosphere to the situation. The whole
stage, in fact, was nicely set for the death and transfiguration
of rush week by this November—until Monday night’s IFC
meeting, that is, when Dean Atwood mentioned that the faculty
will be asked at its next meeting whether it might want to move
the deadlines back by one year.

The faculty will probably do so. The new student center,
which was originally expected to be completed next spring,
will probably not be finished until much later. A deferred
rush next year would thus leave freshmen high and dry
for a semester or more, without fraternity facilities or an
acceptable substitute. Certainly, no one will argue that con-
tinuation of September Rush Week one more time into its
sixtieth-or-so year will cause unalterable damage. To us, at least,
it seems as though the faculty in fairness could do very little
else than push back the deadline for deferred rush to the
1969-70 year.

All the same, after all the sound and fury of last year’s
resolutions (“the faculty commends the IFC for its study of
pledging activities and for its action in the matter. However,
these changes are not a satisfactory response to the resolution
of the faculty of November, 1966’’) and editorials (“if fra-
ternities were healthy, it would not be necessary to quarantine
freshmen from them’’) the passing of a new resolution modify-
ing the first would come as a rather amusing—and relaxing—
anticlimax.

Frankly, we're glad to see it. One of the most objection-
able aspects of last year’s campaign on the part of both faculty
and students for deferred rush and other fraternity reforms
was the impatience, the hasty condemnations, the near-fana-
ticism, the ax-grinding—in short, the high-tragic atmosphere
of the witch hunt. We hope the summer’s recess and a relaxa-
tion of our deferred rush drama will clear away that atmosphere.

A student, on a sabbatical last year,
remarked that the institution he at-
tended had a radical innovation: there
were females taking courses with

males.

The chances of Washington and Lee
going coeducational seem slight in-
deed. The Lee College proposal would
have been a perfect opportunity for in-
troducing the Opposite sex to educa-
tion in Lexington (one college could
have been female), but the plan has
been deferred indefinitely.

Joint Classes

Let it be proposed that it would
be beneficial in many ways if WAL
would initiate joint classes with one
or more of the neighboring female
institutions, With the completion of
Interstate 81, Hollins and Mary
Baldwin can be reached safely in con-
siderably under one hour.

The logical place to start, for it
would be the least disruptive, would
be with seminars on the junior-senior
level. The instructor for the course
could drive to the other campus tak-

 

would meet once a week for three
hours.
Benefits Rendered

The benfits to be rendered by such
an arrangement are many. At the
junior-senior seminar level, courses
could be offered and taken not norm-
ally available on a given campus,
either because of insufficient interest
or because a professor who specializes
in the particular field is unavailable.

More generally speaking it would
afford an opportunity to associate with
the opposite sex in an academic, in-
tellectual setting, an opportunity all
too rare at the moment. Specifically
for the freshmen, it would mean that
their first and most frequent contact
with girls would be in a serious setting
rather than the combo-party scenario
that it is now for most, and the

Record 628 Register Cars With Murray;
Parking Space Must Be Made Available

By RON KESSLER

More than 628 students have regist-
ered cars so far this year, an increase
of about 100 over last year, according
to University Proctor Bob Murray,
Assuming trends will continue as they
have in the past, the number of
registered vehicles will continue to
increase in the future. In addition, the
number of unregistered vehicles, i.e.,
those which slip by Murray is ex-
pected at least to remain constant,

All of this leads to one very
obvious and very pressing con-
clusion: Washington and Lee has
a miserable parking problem,

Although it is a practical impos-
sibility to determine the exact num-
ber of student parking spaces, due to
the fact that there are no lines drawn
in the areas provided by the uni-
versity, Proctor Murray estimates the
number of spaces at 450. This includes
spaces in front of, behind and on the

 

side of Doremus Gymnasium, along
Washington Street, and on the street
leading to VMI. Some spaces are
also available in the VMI-Marshall
Library parking lot.

It is thus becoming more necessary
to leave earlier for class to obtain a
parking space,

Successful methods to alleviate
the parking strain have been insti-
tuted at other colleges; it is ob-
vious that a new system must be
instituted here.

At the University of Pennsylvania
and other big-city schools where the
parking problem is much more acute
than it is at WAL, the administration
has been forced to permit possession
of automobiles for juniors, seniors,
and post-graduates only. At Penn, it
is a possibility that juniors will be
excluded from possession in the near
future.

factory for W&L. The fact that Lex-
ington is so isolated from the rest
of the civilized world indicates that
cars are important for a satisfactory
social life; if sophomores were not
permitted to own a car, then social
life for them as well as for many
students on scholarship, freshmen,
and others who depend upon those
with cars would be hampered.

Other colleges, such as at Union
College in Schenectady, New York,
simply prohibit students from park-
ing on campus. This system would
only succeed if the entire student body
resided on campus, as they do at
Union.

We must finally turn to the par-
ticular problem at Washington and
Lee. There are two feasible solu-
tions, both or either of which must
be instituted in the near future if
chaos is to be stemmed,

 

This solution would not be satis-

Dean Watt Missing?

Concert-Theater Series 'To Open Oct. 13

By JIM SHOES

When a person becomes a new
reporter for the Ring-tum Phi, he
cannot expect the better assignments
to be his right away. So being a true
believer in the adage “an assignment
is what you make it,” I set off with
pen in hand to do a feature article
on the Rockbridge Concert Theater
Series.

When | was given the assignment,
I was told to contact Dean Waitt in
Washington Hall. Being a new stu-
dent as well as a new reporter, I
had no idea who Dean Watt was
or what his connection with the
RCTS could possibly be. | thought
that upon locating the Dean, | would
be able to solve both dilemmas
simultaneously,

Locating Dean Watt is not quite as
easy as one might think. | first looked
in Washington Hall and his secretary
told me to look for him in his other
office in Howe Hall, At Howe Hall
there was a sign telling all who cared
to look that he was not in. As I
traipsed back to Washington Hall, I
came upon a gentleman who had all
the qualities of a dean. He was
poised, confident, intellegent looking
and so on, I was certain that my
search was over. Upon closer inspec-
tion (I asked who he was) | realized
that not only deans have these traits,
but so do registrars,

Upon my return to Washington
Hall, | not only could not find Dean
Watt, but it was also impossible te
locate his secretary. As I pondered my
dilemma 1 found a brochure explain-
ing the function and purpose of the
RCTS

The purpose is to supply culture-
weak Lexington with culture in the
form of four concerts and two plays.
The first of the 4 concerts is to
feature the world-famous Charlie Byrd

additional parking facilities. At the
risk of enraging any local naturalists,
the plots of grass in front of the gym
and in front of the new dormitories
are practically functionless (except
for occasional choose-up football,
baseball, and rugby games) and could
easily be transformed into new areas
for parking, allowing space for pos-
sibly thirty more vehicles.

A few spaces behind the gym that
are presently reserved for the coach-
ing staff could be opened up; surely,
our proponents of physical education
can walk the one hundred yards or
so from the area allotted the faculty,
It is also possible that more parking
space can be constructed behind the
gym.

The most logical, simplest, and
cheapest solution, however, would be
to restrict certain students from driv-
ing to classes by allotting parking
stickers to those who are permitted to
do so.

There is no reason in the world
why those members of Sigma Phi
Epsilon, Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma
Chi, Delta Tau Delta, Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Nu, Phi Kappa Sigma,

Beta Theta Pi, Pi Kappa Alpha,
and Phi Delta Theta, who live in
their respective houses, and stu-
dents living in apartments within
two blocks of the campus should
have to drive to school,

Through rain, snow, sleet, and
whatever, it cannot possibly take more
than five mintes to walk to any class

from any of the aforementioned
houses, This should cut the number
of cars driving to classes by a fairly
large percentage and thus alleviate
much of the problem. After, say
1:00 p.m., parking wonld revert to a
first-come, first-take basis.

In any event, something had best
be done immediately, as parking is
at a premium, and that premium is on
its Way up.

 

Alumnus Answered

27 September 1967
lo the Ring-tum Phi Editor:
Dear Sir:

I was very happy to see in last
week's edition a letter from an
alumnus giving his Opinions on uni-
versity issues. It is unfortunate that
we don't have more alumni like Mr,
Groner who show great interest in
the development of our university.
Alumni could contribute a great deal
by their ideas and aid not only the
university but also the fraternities.

However, | must admit that I am
in strong disagreement with one of
Mr. Groner's recommendations, He
proposed that “W&L must become,
and rather quickly too, a broadly in-
novative center of some particular
field.” If this is not done, Mr. Groner
claims, WAL will be swamped by the
rapid expansion in the number of
junior colleges and the increasing
wealth of the larger universities,

Blue Seeking First Win

 

Generals To Tackle
Rugged Jackets Sat.

By THUNDER THORNTON

Washington and Lee will attempt
to even its football record Saturday
at Wilson Field against an always
tough Randolph-Macon College team.
Ugly rumor has it that the Yellow
Jackets from Ashland, Virginia may
well be the Generals’ strongest op-
ponent of the season, and this sup-
position, together with the home
team’s opening loss to Guilford, seems
to indicate a long afternoon in Lex-
ington for the home forces. However,
the opening home game crowd should
see a different team from the one that
fell to Guilford 35-0.

Coach Lee McLaughlin and his as
sistants have had two weeks to light
a fire under the Generals, and squad
members have been diligently “getting
ready for Macon.” The Big Blue has
several scores to settle with the
Jackets, one of which is the 28-0
shutout defeat suffered at the hands
of R-MC last year. In addition, Andy
Bloom and his offensive cohorts will
be seeking to push a score over
against the strong Yellow Jacket de
fense, something that has eluded Gen
eral ballearriers and receivers for three
consecutive years.

Coach Mac pointed out a need for
“organization” in an interview with
a Richmond paper recently, and prac
tice sessions have emphasized this im

| portant factor, First game jitters
seemed to be responsible for several
costly errors that presented the Quak-
ers from North Carolina with a couple
of easy scores. Both the “blue”
offensive team and “red” defensive
squads have worked to iron out these
mental errors but also to sharpen and
polish the execution of assignments.
Doing the individual jobs against the
Jackets will be of great importance,
for the visitors are a Green Bay
Packer-lype team—nothing fancy, but
they can kill you with execution,
Explosive Jacket Offense
Pacing the R-MC offense is junior
quarterback Dave Wetzel, a_ triple
threat star who last year guided his
team to a seven win season, with
only one loss and a tie marring the
record. Wetzel has built his reputation
on his ability to throw the sprint-out
pass to a group of fine receivers, and,
when not looking downfield for re-
ceivers, to run the ball on the keeper
or the bootleg. But the Jackets have
the footsoldiers to keep a defense
honest. The best running back in the
R-MC camp is last year’s leading

| Millersville State last week Wetsel,

Every year about this time, Wash-
ington and Lee University head soccer
coach Joe Lyles casually will say
his team will do all right in the com-
ing months if no one gets hurt.

“We have a good little first team,”
Lyles will say, “but we could use
some more depth...a lot more.”

And every year, despite frequent
injuries, the Generals have produced
winners, Last season's record was
8-3-1, the one before that was 7-3-0,
and so on and so forth. In 1964,
W&L was selected to play in the
NCAA regional play-offs.

Well, it’s no different this fall.
| Once again, Lyles has made the state-

 

f | ment, and once again his Generals

| indeed appear to be strong in the

| front ranks but weak in reserves.

| “We're hurting at halfback, on the
| line, and in the goal,” says Lyles.
|“We just don’t have the back-up
| strength,

“We have two reserve goalies, for
example, but they're much too in-
experienced, If we lost Tom Mitchell,
our starter, then it’s all over. It'll be
suicide if we don't have him.”

Mitchell, whom Lyles rates as one
of the best goalkeepers to come along
in years, allowed only 19 points last
year as a sophomore. He's also a
centerfielder during baseball season

“Mitchell's got excellent reflexes,”

Sophomore cand caller CHUCK KUHN, impressive in W&L’s as to Guil-| say Lyles, “and he’s not afraid to

ford, could see heavy action in tomorrow's contest.

Depth Key Factor
For W&L Harriers

Senior co-captains Bob Stack and
Corbet Bryant, undoubtly, have their
hands full this fall as they take over
Washington and Lee’s cross-country
leadership from the graduated Bill
Wildrick and Bill Lowry.

Wildrick and Lowry were the prime
movers last year in helping earn a
3-3 record for the Generals in spite
of some depth problems that cropped
up frequently. Now that those two

non-fraternity freshmen enjoy.

Washington and Lee and the neigh-
boring girl schools lose many pros-
pective students and people who trans-
fer out simply because of the lack
of any coed situation. What is needed
is a set-up that renders the benefits
of both the coed and segregated
situation,

Intellectually, women are here to
stay in all fields of endeavor. It is
generally recognized that they are
significantly more serious students
than men. Their attitude would do
W&L no harm, A _ professor once

to W&L’s. It seems unlikely, on the
other hand, that the powers that be
would permit moving ‘Traveller's
academically if Hollins or Randolph-
Macon was located where VML is.
Future Relationship

This all raises more general ques-
tions as to the nature of future
relationships between W&L and the

neighboring schools. Rising costs
coupled with the rising relative in-
ability to obtain substantial funds,
directs that further cooperation in
usage of facilities, monetary, bureau-
cratic, physical, and academic, e.g.,
an interlocking library system, as
distance permits, be initiated.

rarity, The Macon defenders are big
and mobile and the scouting reports
remark on their obvious love of
initial contact and pursuit. The combi-
nation of a quick striking offense and
rugged defense has made Randolph-
Macon one of the most feared small
college teams in the state, but the
Generals are eagerly awaiting the
kickoff for a chance to chop the
visitors down a few notches, Coach
Mac’s men are dedicated to the pro-
position that R-MC must pay for

every point given up in the Guilford |

Organization

Week

Organization Week will conclude
tonight with the Calyx meeting at 7
in the Student Union and the Civil
War Round Table at 7:30, also in
the Student Union.

According to Steve Saunders, presi-
dent of the Assimilation Committee,
freshman response to this year’s
Organization Week has been rather
slow. The poor response is mainly
attributed to the lateness in the de-
livery of schedules pertaining to the
many activities offered.

Statistics on individual organiza-
tions are incomplete, but a large
delegation of freshman did show in-
terest in the Troubadors.

develop into a real good one. “He's
got plenty of stamina,” says Miller,
“but he'll have to concentrate on
getting to the front sooner, then stay-
ing there. His kick could be a little
better, too, but | think we can remedy
that soon enough.”

Bryant, on the other hand, has been
one of the pleasant suprises. He has
steadily improved over the years, to

-} such an extent that he now must be

considered a favorite in any meet.
He's tall, thin, and has plenty of
endurance, all the qualities of a top-
notch long-distance runner. “We're
real high on him,” says Miller, “He's
worked real hard to become the
performer he is, and there’s no doubt
he'll continue to improve himself.”

The Generals open their 1967 cam-
paign tomorrow in Lexington against
the Spidermen of Richmond. Juniors
Mike Hosford and Ralph Pearcy, both
hampered by injuries, are not ex-
pected to see action, as the depth
problem once again becomes a factor
in W&L’s outlook.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 3, 1967

The faculty, in its monthly meeting |
yesterday afternoon, postponed the |
deadline for deferred rush until the |
1969-70 session, The faculty had asked |
the IFC to submit a plan for rush to
be deferred, at least until after the |
first semester, commencing with the
1968-69 session.

 

For ‘Law Review’

night and decided to subsidize law
students’ subscriptions to the
Review.

Bill Schildt, president of the Student
Bar Association, presented the SBA
case. The SBA has in the past given}
the Law Review $400 which has|
covered the cost of the Law Review |
for the law students. Schildt stated

that in recent years the SBA has

 

undertaken a more ambitious program
of speakers, freshman law student
orientation, and mock trials.

Schildt said that the SBA’s $400
contribution would soon become quite
a burden for the SBA. He hoped
that this contribution from the EC
would counter-balance the inequities
which see the law students also pay-|
ing for the predominantly under-
graduate publications such as the
Ring-tum Phi, the Calyx and Ariel.

Leonard made the motion and
Crenshaw seconded it, that the SBA
should receive this year $400 to pay
for law school subscriptions to the
Law Review. This motion passed un-
animously.

In other action, President Richard
Nash noted that applications are being
accepted for the newly formed Cur-
riculum Committee, and he hoped
that any interested person would sub-
mit a written application

Ihe only other vote was the un
animous decision to allow the

ment with any make of school rings

Leure Us Not Rest Now

During the summer we received a letter from an acquaint-
ance who saw the Troubadours’ superb-in-every-way production
last March of ‘‘Marat/Sade.” “Believe it or not,” the letter
read in part, “I still quake, remembering that production.”
So do we.

Each night (four) of its run, “Marat” played to standing-
room-only crowds (we are unable to laugh or even smile in
noting that, in this instance, “SRO crowd” and “156 people”
are synonymous). Each member of those four audiences must
have been as impressed as we by the excellent scenery—until
the truth did out. The walls of the theatre had simply been
stripped bare; a few appropriate scrawlings had been added
to those remaining from the building’s days as a cobblery and
pool hall—and behold!—an asylum.

We note with satisfaction, therefore, two encouraging de-
velopments over the summer:

 

® The mini-renovation of the existing structure, and

® More significantly, the statement that the University sin-
cerely hopes to appropriate, as soon as possible, up to $3,-
500,000 for an “adequate auditorium and ‘little theatre’,” as
part of Washington and Lee’s development program being
headed by Messrs. Frank Parsons and Farris Hotchkiss. (The
statement is contained as a footnote in the “Report of the Visit-
ing Committee,” the accreditors who spent three days here
last spring—incidentally, a highly provocative document that
each student would do well to read.)

To now, the Troubs—who are, after all, probably W&L’s
number-one tangible vehicle of good relations with towns-
people, not to mention their role as purveyors of entertain-
ment and dramatic edification to the Washington and Lee
community—have been imprisoned, artistically, in a degrading
and disgraceful mausoleum. From the point of audience con-
venience, the theatre has been made slightly less inadequate.
Even the Lyric, though, always had bathrooms; and it is humili-
ating that the only other things in the renovated theatre we
can brag about are the increase of the seating capacity all the
way to 182, and the installation of a heating system (God
bless the Hill) that works, and quietly at that. The stage, how-
ever, is no bigger (this is the stage that made “Enemy of the
People” almost ludicrous because the biggest “crowd” the
stage would accommodate in the mob scene consisted of fewer
people than there were speaking parts for) ; the lighting facili-
ties remain unimproved (we suspect that no electrical con-
tractor alive would touch the Troubs’ equipment with a ten-foot
insulated pole). There still is no “backstage” area, although
the new “‘sidestage” annex is something of an improvement;
the upstairs workshop-dressing room area is unspeakable, so
we won't.

All in all, we don’t think the Troub Theatre—physically—
is yet a credit to this University; the FROGS, Rockbridge
Players and every other local, non-W&L group will probably
continue to use the Waddell School in the conscious attempt
to avoid all possible professional contact with the Troubadour
Slum.

The mere initiation of serious administrative discussion
about something is nevertheless a major accomplishment at
Washington and Lee; we are pleased, then, that apparently
nobody is content with the state of the Troubadours’ facilities—

which even now only faith and hard, hard work make a

“theatre.”

Third Thoughts

We must note with thanks the faculty’s new and reason-
able attitude towards rush, as evidenced in yesterday's success-
ful reconsideration of last year’s two deferred rush ultimata.
In light of a statement made by a dean May | on the occasion
of the passage of the second faculty resolution that it “prob-
ably” was not contingent on the completion of the expanded
student union, it appears that perhaps second thoughts—or
ought we say third—were had by some on the entire matter.

Perhaps they realized that legislate though the faculty
might, a situation would inevitably be created over which
neither the faculty nor the Inter-Fraternity Council would have
the slightest controlling power.

Probably deferred rush will be forced into effect when the
student union is completed. One hopes that in “suggesting”
a program to be followed on that occasion by the fraternities
and the IFC, the faculty will maintain the attitude of moderate-
ness demonstrated yesterday—an attitude which for the first
time in two years of deferred rush debate bring the faculty
and student body a little closer to mutual non-unacceptability.

Gov. Ronald Reagan landed Fri-
day in Columbia, S.C., to the tumultu-
ous roar of a worshipful crowd. The
full day of activities was highlighted
that night with an amazing $100-a-
plate dinner attended by over 3,500.
This outpouring was unprecedented
in Southern political history, Twelve
Washington and Lee Young Republi-
cans made the 350-mile trip, and a
correspondent for the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi was seated between reporters
from the New York Times and a
color NBC camera.

The Washington and Lee delega-
tion left about 10 a.m. and arrived
in time for a 5 p.m. private reception
at a downtown hotel, Upon entering
the hotel, Miss South Carolina greeted
the W&L group and went with them
to the mobbed ballroom. Pandemon-
ium broke out as the senior senator
from South Carolina, Strom Thur-
mond, introduced the man of the hour
as “one of the world’s great figures.”
The next hour was one of pushing
and shoving to get in position to meet
the governor, which was successfully
accomplished by the determined Lex-
ington travelers.

Touchy Questions

At the afternoon press conference
the governor was confronted with a
series of touchy questions. Race is
always good copy in the South and
he let it be known that he believed
“laws alone cannot solve racial prob-
lems.” The governor says he thinks
the idea of the war on poverty is
“lofty,” yet he says federal money
alone cannot provide a beter living
to the American poor.

He urged having private industry
help out with the employment situa-
tion, but recognized that government

the overflow crowd in

has responsibility in this area. He
attacked the idea of splintering third
parties, earning the hatred of the
segregalionist Independent Party in
South Carolina. He went further and
reminded the audience there was no
such thing today as a hyphenated Re-
publican and they couldn't afford to
defeat themselves by division, Thus
he refused to classify himself on the
spectrum,

rhe reception was followed by the
_cold-cut dinner in the basement of
| the auditorium. The meal was hurried
| so that good seats could be obtained

president may be, knows best.” This
was eaten up by the throng of newly
converted Republicans and was broad-
cast to the entire state on an hour
of prime television time. The impact
of this one-time Democrat could be
devastating to the state’s crumbling
Democratic establishment for this
point alone,

This partisan approach gave way to
his description of the dangers of big
government, The waste, intolerance,
and aggressiveness, he said, is not a
deliberate attempt to usurp power, but
is the product of good intentions, “It
is so easy for the dedicated public
servant to see how much could be
accomplished if only he had a little
more authority and, of course, a little
more money.”

He contrasted this rise of the
bureaurcracy to the development of
his administration in California. This
is the “Creative Society” and the
audience became more enthusiastic as
he listed its accomplishments.

Paxton Davis's novel, “The Seasons
of Heroes,” is a “whereafter.” The
third narrator of the novel explains
that his grandfather would use the
word “whereafter” in order to launch
himself from the climax of a tale
out into “an unforeseeable and al-
together astonishing sequel,” inevitably
to the amazement and great delight
of his grandchildren, The purpose of
a “whereafter” is “to stretch a tale
out to its absolute uttermost.”

“The Season of Heroes” tells the

boneys, three of whom speak for
themselves in their roles as narrators
of the three more-or-less self-contain-
ed sections of the novel. The first
section deals with Robert Gibboney,
who in 1864 takes part in a Con-
federate raid into Pennsylvania, In
the second section Robert's father,
Matthew, tells the story of his life
from his early childhood through his
long career in the U.S. Army, con-
cluding with his being offered a com-

mission in the Army of the Confed-
eracy. The third section concerns the
‘involvement of Robert's son William
in a race riot in 1912,

Opportunity for Heroism

Each of the narrators is faced with
an opportunity for heroism, Robert as
he looks down the barrel of his re-
volver into the face of a Yankee
soldier, Matthew as he considers the
commission of general in the Confed-
erate army offered him, and William
as he faces an enraged lynch mob to
protect a Negro he does not like. The
choices the three must make are simi-
lar, and the unity of the novel lies
in this fact. Paxton Davis's style car-
ries the reader along to these three
climaxes very effectively.

This is not a book to try to go to
sleep over. But, more importantly,
Professor Davis does not allow him-
self and his reader the benefit of an
easy solution in any of the situations,
And, since the novel is a “whereafter,”
he does not allow the reader to stop
with any one of the climaxes.

Enjoyable to Read

The novel is well written, then, It
is enjoyable to read. It is well con-
structed: each of
suggests something about the meaning
of the other two sections. But what
is most successful about this historical
novel is its relevance today. Young

that accounts left unattended for either
four months or one semester will be
subject to Committee action. A viola-
tion of this type will be treated in the
same manner as a cold-check viola-
tion.

The fining system for cold checks,
as in the past, begins at one dollar.
The second offense results in fines
up to five dollars; and the third cold
check violation carries a maximum
$25 fine, as well as a possible appear-
ance before the EC for further action,
The duration of time for accumula-
tion of offenses is again two years,

Tigher Controls
Much tighter controls will be ex-
ercised this year in dealing with viola-
tors. A letter will be sent to the
student the first week informing him

that he must apepar before the Com-
mittee. In the past, many students
have dismissed hearings before the

Committee as unnecessary, if the mer-
chant had himself fined the student,

If the student fails to appear, he
will be contacted personally by a
member of the Committee. The EC
will deal with those violators who do
not appear after the second notice.

The Cold Check Committee is send-
ing letters to Lexington merchants ex-
plaining both its purpose and the pro-
ceedure for reporting a student who
has cashed a cold check.

significant realm of the shape of one’s
life.

Ihe last few pages of the first sec-
tion were published as a separte short
story in the November 1962 issue of
Playboy. The point of that story was

clearly stated: “evil is not inflicted

on man; it is what man did himself.”
The moral still holds true, but Pro-

| fessor Davis has reworked his story,

adding and deleting, so that now it
is a more subtle, much more effective
piece of writing. (For one thing, the

| general’s name is changed from Me-
| Causland

to McNaught; the closest
the narrator comes to a moral in the
novel is “We find in war the self we
dare not face in peace.”) The mean-
ing of the novel is much more com-
plex than that of the story, but also
more significant and presented with a
great deal more art.

@ Alumni Discuss Ways
ToImprove Relations

Representatives of alumni chapters
from all over the country yesterday
heard administrative leaders call for
“better communications” between the
university and alumni.

Approximately 60 alumni and their
wives attended the meeting yesterday
afternoon in Lee Chapel, at the be-
ginning of a three-day series of meet-
ings with administrators, faculty, and
students. The alumni represent 35 of
WAL’s 45 organized alumni chapters.

“Washington and Lee—An Over-
view” was the subject of the intro-
ductory session, presented by a panel
consisting of Acting President Wil-

He also warned, however, that “Wash-
ington and Lee has needs—terribly
expensive needs.”

Concluding the discussion, Mr. Par-
sons presented the delegates with some
of the plans and goals of the newly-
formed Development Committe, while
admitting “we are in a difficult year”

that he “certainly hoped” the en

ferences would increase W&L’s contri

Mr. Haynes said that the greatest
need of the conference is to acquaint
alumni with the changes that have
taken place, and to convince them of
need for future improvement. He

Our Congratulations

It’s not too often that we get the chance to be unreservedly
complimentary about something. In the first place, any such

enthusiasm about any aspect of

W&L usually raises a host of

cynical eyebrows. In the second place, the standard editorial
cliches (“we view with alarm” or “we note with dismay”) are
ill-suited to congratulations. However, two unconnected events
this week make it well worth braving both eyebrows and cliches
to extend a little praise to where it’s due.

ok

The special conference for alumni chapter representatives
is the most heartening thing we’ve seen in a long, long time.

When big-time football left the W&L campus, so did a
lot of the alumni spirit, and we’ve been a long time in finding
out ways to win it back. Last year a limited program of alumni-
faculty and alumni-student interchange was conducted for the

benefit of 11 of the university’s
gram was so successful that it has

12 alumni directors. The pro-
been expanded to a full three-

day event with some 60 alumni present, representing 35 of 45
alumni chapters all over the country.

To judge from yesterday’s opening session in Lee Chapel,
the enlarged program is enjoying all the success it deserves. The
administration officials who made up the panel were on the
whole remarkably frank in reminding the alumni of their
responsibilities to Washington and Lee, both financiallly and
otherwise. Mr. Parsons did not hesitate to score the “token
responses” which soothe the alumni’s conscience and do
nothing to solve W&L’s problems. Mr. Whitehead did not
conceal the fact that the university’s present solid financial
situation is not necessarily a guarantee of good health in the
future. The general outlines of W&L’s future development
were spelled out from expansion of physical facilities to the

selection of the new president.
situations with administration,

Further meetings in informal
faculty, and students should

present the alumni with an even broader picture of what’s
going on at W&L—something which many of them have been

missing for all too long.
For their part, the alumni
which, if it can be maintained,

yesterday showed an interest
may actually lead someday to

a revived sense of involvement among the alumni as a whole.
As one impressed gentleman said after yesterday’s meeting:
“Keep this coming!” The questions afterwards covered fed-
eral aid, alumni participation at other universities, the size of
the endowment—and a request for annual, detailed reports
from the university to the alumni.

The organizers of the events and the alumni who have at-
tended it, deserve our most sincere congratulations,

te

Kudos also go to the EC this week, fo rtaking on the task

of cleaning out the Augean

Schedule.

stables of our Examination

The weaknesses of the exam schedule as it now exists
are so patently obvious that only those who have never taken
examinations under it can still argue for its fairness. The
schedule is an utterly arbitrary machine. Certain compromises
have been made in the direction of easing the load on fresh-

men; everyone else suffers.

The question is not whether the schedule should be re-
formed. The question is how reform can be carried out in such
a manner as to make it possible for students to arrange their
own schedules, without also making the task of the professor
who must grade the exams impossible. The problem, then, is

not one of ends, but of means.

The proposals brought before

the EC last night show a sensible awareness of these facts—

and a sensible awareness that some change is needed.

THE RING-

By PATRICK AREY
Staff Writer

George Wallace is a small, intense
man. Hair carefully combed, well
dressed, his appearance is far from
the stereotyped Southern politician
image of past years,

Making his way through the crowd
at Roanoke College last Saturday
afternoon, one couldn't help but be
disappointed at the man’s appearance.
He hardly looks the racist that he is
supposed to be.

As he mounted the platform, his
half dozen bodyguards placed them-
selves nearby, but not at any discreet
distance.

Speaking of the common man, us-
ing as an example the textile workers
he had spoken to in Danville the day
before, Wallace always says “we.”
Rarely does he say “I” or “you,”
usually it’s “we” or “us.”

“The average man don’t understand |
it,” Wallace said, talking about the
current American scene, and especi-
ally the summer riots. Then speaking
of the “average man” from Alabama,
he said, “They can call us rough-
necks, rednecks, and bigots, but there
are a lot like us in New York, Cali-
fornia, and Virginia.” Appropriate
applause followed.

The crowd was not big, perhaps |
a thousand. Students were sitting on
the lawn, many beards among them.
Outside the immediate area which had
been cordoned off, was the public
which had come to see the man.

The applause which came through-
out the speech was marked by the
enthusiasm of the public, and little
among the students. The students
had come to hear, but they didn't
seem to be buying Wallace's brand.

The reporters who were following
Wallace on his two day tour through
the state didn't bother taking notes.
He said the same thing wherever he
went.

The
tacked

theme was the same: he at-
the “liberal” press, “theor-
eticians, professors,” _ intellectuals,
vietniks, and always, the federal
establishment.

“Stir things up...”

His first statement was a defense
of the Constitution, Our purpose, he
said, is “to defend property owner-
ship and the free enterprise system.”
Without property rights, he asked, are
there any rights? Look at the com-
munist system, he said.

Other themes he struck were schools,
the Vietnam war, law and order, and
newspapers.

Wallace received loud applause
when he told the group that unless
President Johnson or the 1968 Re-
publican presidential nominee prom-
ises to return the operation of the
schools to the states, he will run “and
we will stir things up...”

Local citizens, Wallace said, have
the “morality, ability, and the intel-
ligence” to run their own schools.

On the Vietnam war and foreign
aid, Wallace said, instead of sanction-
ing the British for trading with the

desia.

If he becomes president, Wallace
said he would cut off foreign aid to
countries that do not do their part
in fighting communism. Unconcerned
with America’s image abroad, Wallace
said the time has come “to let them
worry about what we think of them
instead of us worrying about what
they think of us.”

His greatest applause came when
Wallace blamed the U. S. Supreme
Court and President Johnson for
violence in the streets. The police, he
said, are the “thin line” between
anarchy and order within the coun-
try.

There is no excuse, he said, for
destruction of the internal security
of this country.

On the “liberal” press, Wallace
quoted former Arkansas Governor
Orval Faubus, who said, “Life is made
for people who couldn't read, and
Time for those who couldn’t think.”

Speaking of the New York Times,
Wallace said, if the balance of power
has slipped to the Communists, it’s
due to moral support in America.

Concerning communists, Wallace
says he knows one by instinct.

Evolution of Openings

W&L’s First

Fall dances seem to have been
popular at W&L for almost a cen-
tury, but there has not always been
a fixed dance known as “Openings.”
Our present form of Openings Dances
is the result of a gradual evolution
which is outlined below:

 

The first Calyx (1876) contains a
paragraph about a “Fancy Dress Hop”
held in October. This was not an
annual affair however. By 1879, there
was what was known as the Hop
Club, which had the responsibility
of giving a fall dance.

In 1897, the first year of the Ring-
tum Phi’s publication, the paper an-
nounced that the “Cotillion Club gave
a very delightful hop on the eighth
(of October).” This is the first refer-
ence to the Cotillion Club, which was
to play a major role in the develop-
ment of Openings until the club ceas-
ed to exist in the 1950's,

In this year, the “Opening Hop”
featured, according to the Calyx, “a
large number of visiting young ladies
from Lynchburg, Richmond, and
Staunton.”

In the early part of the century,
dances in October were almost totally
obscured by fall football, which
weekly occupied the entire front page
of the Ring-tum Phi. Fall dances still
went on, but the only published

reference to the Opening Hop in 1916
was a small, sixth page article in the
R-t P which stated that VMI was

The influence of the Great War

was felt in the 1917 hop. The new
Doremus Gymnasium was decorated
with the national colors, and VMI
first-classmen attended.

In 1919, for the first time, the
Ring-tum Phi ran a small front page
article on the dance. “Especially in-
teresting,” announced the paper, “were
the ‘jazzations’ of the drummer, whose
work on the traps and general de-
meanor on the platform was enough
to stop the dance and attract myriads
around him.”

1925

Opening Hop was on October 17,
and was informal, the music being
furnished by the now-defunct “South-
ern Collegians” (reputed to be rein-
carnated as the “Hot Nuts”). Fresh-
men were required to wear green
bow-ties to the hop and could only
stay an hour unless they had dates
or were on the freshmen football
squad,

Four years later, Wall Street crash-
ed, but depression conditions didn’t
seem to affect the gaity of the “Open-
ing Dance” (as it was called by then)

which featured the “Carolina Tar-
heels.”

In ‘35 the traditional fall dance

was combined with Homecoming to
create the “Homecoming Dances.”

played the Wahoos. The price to the
dance set was $2.50, and the weekend
featured Jelly Leftwich and Band.
By 1936, the Ring-tum Phi finally
considered the fall dance newsworthy
enough to give it a page-wide head-
line. As usual, the Cotillon Club made
the arrangements for the weekend,
whose cost had risen to $5.50 per
student. On the 16th of October, the
Sophomore gave their dance, followed
on the next day by a football game
with Kentucky and a formal dance.
The next week, the Ring-tum Phi
announced, “FIRST DANCE SHOWS
PROFIT . . . Success of Set Paves
Way for Permanent Openings Set.”
1936 might be considered the birth
date of “Openings” proper. Our pres-
ent Openings got its name and was
firmly established in this year.

1942

Despite the poor student support in
1941 and a resulting Dance Board
deficit of $387.15, not to mention war-
time restrictions, Openings was held
as usual, featuring Bobby Byrne and
the VMI Commanders. From 1943 to
1946, Openings was not held.

In 1947, Openings came back to
life with the pre-war type of dance.

In October, only a short time be-
fore the scheduled Openings, the
Ring-tum Phi ran this headline:

Generals Chall

Rudd Smith Boots Way
Into National Punting List

By SHELDON MILLER

Rutherford Paul Crooks Smith,
otherwise known as Rudd Smith, has
suddenly found himself to be ranked
as the third best punter in small
college ball. The N.C.A.A. ratings
showed a two way tie for first at
47.5 yds. per kick, and then Rudd
in third with a 46.0 yd. average.
These ratings were after only one
game in which Smith kicked 9 times
for 414 yds. Last Saturday against
Randolph-Macon Smith again kicked
9 times, but his total yardage was
somewhat less at 365.

Coach Mac explains this drop by
saying, “Rudd was called on to kick
out of bounds and for field position
several times. This hurt his average,
but was a necessary team effort.”

At the present time Rudd’s average
stands at 43.3, having kicked 18 times

the season just underway, it would

Rudd hails from Summerville, S. C.
where he also punted for his high
school team. At present Rudd is a
Sigma Nu, senior and also Co-Captain
of this year’s squad,

Asked if he had practiced kicking
this summer Rudd said that he had
little opportunity. “I spent the sum-
mer in Naval Reserve Camp at New-
port, R.I. It's right on a windy bay
and almost impossible to punt.”

This year punting duties have fallen
on Rudd as they have in the two
previous years. At the moment Rudd
is confined to punting due to an in-
jury acquired in a pre-season game
against Elong College when Rudd
cracked several ribs,

Coach Mac hails Rudd as a versa-
tile player. This can be attributed to
the fact that as a sophomore Rudd
played both ways and last year was
a defensive specialist.

Unfortunately, some of Rudd's
better punts have had long returns,
such as the 69 yd. TD return made
against us by Guilford. Coach Mac
credits these returns to a new NCAA
rule concerning kick coverage. “This

It has been several years since such
a regular feature has appeared in
this paper, a feature devoted solely
and seriously to athletics at Wash-
ington and Lee. Perhaps the reason
for this has been a lack of willing
writers, but, in my opinion, it has
had more to do with the general
attitude among the student body con-
cerning the spirit of athletics at this
universily

Although no one who is today a
student at WAL had any direct ac-
quaintance with the athletic scandal

| and subsequent desubsidization actions |

of 1954, the present student body is,
1 believe, the receipient of a wave
of feeling these events produced,
With desubsidization came small-time
athletics, and in the minds of many,
this was equated with “bush-league-

ness,” a phrase which easily evoked
a “Who cares?” attitude. Since 1954,
that feeling has made itself felt with
varying degrees of intensity on the
Washington and Lee sports scene.
But several occurrences the last
few years have done much to dispell
the belief that small-time athletics is

| not good athletics. The two outstand-

ing General football elevens of 1960
and 1961 announced the rebirth of
WA&L on the gridiron. It has become
common knowledge that the best col-
legiate tennis in the State of Virginia
is played beneath the “World's Long-
est Concrete Footbridge.” And finally,
as anyone who witnessed the CAC
Basketball Tournament last year can
tell you, the freshman “suicide swan
dive” is no longer the most exciting
event in Doremus Gymnasium. That
honor falls to Messrs. Cartwright,

olonels Saturday

Fresh from a highly spirited con-
test with Randolph-Macon, Washing-
ton and Lee’s “Big Blue” is anxiously
awaiting the Saturday encounter with
tough Centre College—a game that
literally smacks with a chance for
another conference championship by
the Generals.

Coach Lee McLaughlin, in a recent
interview, seemed to express the pre-
vailing optimism exhibited by the
team. Coach “Mac,” evidently pleased
with the fine performance of quarter-
back Bloom, stated “The best place
to hurt Centre is with our passing-
game—you can't run against them
very often for long gains.” Although
the Generals do have short passes in
their repertoire, fans should expect
a number of pass attempts for reason-
ably good distances.

Commenting on the offensive at-
tack of Centre, Coach “Mac” also
noted, “They have been hitting for
the boomer, as well as pushing for
the needed yardage by a fine ground
| attack.” However, from the recent
display of adept pass protection and
the show of a strong forward front
against a ground attack by Randolph-
Macon, Centre’s offense could be de-
cisively hampered.

One key advantage in the strategy
for “Big Blue is the quick kick—a well
evidenced surprise against the Macon
Yellowjackets. Combined with a fine
passing game, this play might well
make that all important difference in
the key moments of the game, when
surprise is needed. Indeed, Centre has
yet to exhibit any quick kick, thus

such programs as the renovation of
the Trobadour Theater are “a stop-
gap, not a permanent solution” to
problems of physical expansion. He
noted that alumni response to fund
appeals has been adequate but un-
impressive: “We believe it can be
better.”

A question-and-answer period fol-
lowed the talks.

The delegates and their wives were
the guests of Acting President and
Mrs. Pusey after the opening session.
During the social hour members of
the faculty and administration talked
informally with the delegates.

Afte dinner in Evans Dining Hall,
the alumni and their wives adjourned
to the Alumni House to talk in-
formally and at length about Uni-
versity concerns.

foday’s activities began at 9 a.m.
in Lee Chapel. Dean of the College
Pusey, Dean Lewis W. Adams of
the School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration, and Dean E. R. Huntley
of the Law Schol, discussed the status
of their respective schools and ex-
plored with the delegates the chal-
lenges and opportunities the schools
face.

At 1 p.m. the delegates had lunch
with 30 students representing every
facet of student life. No faculty mem-
ber or administrative officer was pres-
ent at this session. Richard Nash,
President of the Executive Committee
of the Student Body, presided.

After lunch the delegates heard
from Dr. Edward C. Atwood, Dean
of Students and chairman of the Ad-
missions Committee, Mr. James D.
Farrar, Director of Admission, and
Mr. William A. Noel, Director of
Financial Aid. They explained the
University’s admissions standards and
practices, the function of the faculty
committee on admissions and the
availability and allocation of financial
aid,

ably wouldn't get the point across).
According to Ed Side, Saturday and
Sunday are the best night of the
week, varying in direct proportion to
weather, sporting events, hour quizzes,
and the tube (to whit, last year when
the Pit-Lyric was playing One-Eyed
Jacks, so was the Columbia Broad-
casting System). However, with Ed
Side’s current program of relatively
current foreign films, he does not feel
that television is as great a draw.

Ed Side lives above the Pit-Lyric,
as do several W&L students, one of
whom claims that the noise doesn’t
bother him; however, after two days
listening to it, there’s no way that
you can resist seeing the flick.

Few things have changed at the
Lyric-Pit. The announcement “Pre-
views of Coming Attractions” is as
antique as the theater, built in the
dirty-thirties. The infamous Mid-
night Show on the eve of school
vacations no longer exists because
of the fairly destructive acts of
student-celebrants, one of whom

This allows for longer returns and
fewer fair catches.”

Without a very potent offense a
team will find that it needs good
kicking specialists. This year W&L
finds itself with two extremely good
returning lettermen. One is Smith and
the other is Cary Green.

Green, a PiKA from Bowling Green,

Va. showed his graceful field goal
style last week by zeroing in on the
crossbars for two long fields and
an extra point that provided the mar-
gin of victory.
“Although Smith and Green are dif-
ferent types of kickers, they have one
thing in common—do something
when the drive stalls.

This week should be a strong test
for these two capable kickers, be-
cause if W&L is to beat Centre they
will need to keep them as deep in
their own territory as possible and
will need to score every chance they
have, whether it be a 40 yd. field
goal or an extra point. This will be
the duties of Smith and Green.

ever, stayed to talk for a few minutes.
Wallace stepped down from the plat-

He moved slowly through the remain-
ing crowd, shawing hands, being
photographed with people, talking for
a minute with someone,

Nearby, two students and a pro-
fessor were talking.

“There are three elements of fasc-
ism: emotionalism, rationalism, and
patriotism” one student was saying.
“They are all there.”

By 1950, except for the demise of
the Cotillion Club and the substitution
of the concert for the Sophomore
Prom, the evolution of Openings was
complete.

Johnson Pans “Dirty Dozen”

(Continued from page 2)
of real life they are capable of giving
is an epileptic approximation of real
movement. It is as if Aldrich and
his associates hoped all that thrash-
ing around would warm them into
life. In other words, when they aren't
beating up Germans the characters
don’t really do anything. Johnson and
Heller have had to intrduce a lot of
military humor (jokes about the brass,
jokes about the food, etc.) to fill
up blank spaces in the film caused
by dearth of good characterization.
Chance for Fine Story

The fact that the prisoners don't
come off as dramatic creations also
stops short development of another of
the film’s possibilities (if you don’t
think the prisoners fail to be realized
as believable characters, try for a
minute to imagine them outside of
the film's immediate context), There
was the chance for a fine story about
the transition and integration of
twelve all but unintegratable indivi-
duals into a cohesive group. Unfor-
tunately, the fact that we aren't pre-
sented with twelve individuals pretty
well precludes this possibility. I sup-
pose if the artists involved had been
more attentive to, and more patient
with, details concerning the period of
training, or to the sensitivity of the
men as concerns others conceptions
and opinions of them, something like

 

Footbridge

(Continued from page 3)
“spirit of the game.” On the other
hand, he also wants the students,
faculty, and administration to become
fully appreciative of the meaning of
quality athletics in an unsubsidized
environment. The athlete at WA&L,
who is a student-athlete in the truest
sense of the word, deserves recogni-
tion for the work he puts in while
his classmates are at the Liquid or
the four o'clock flick. This column
will be his forum,

It looks as if the pendulum is start-
ing to swing back. Supporting athletics
at W&L may soon be the “in” thing
again. Who knows, maybe some day
a W&L quarterback will have to hold
up his hands and ask the stands to be
quiet.

the grounds for group cohesiveness
might have been laid. But as_ the
movie stands the reasons for mutual
cooperation, for unity, and even for
affection, are virtually incomprehen-
sible.

There is little to add except that
“The Dirty Dozen” is doing except-
ionally well at the box office. I guess
this is because it is enjoyable if a
person apprehends it only with an
eighth of the intelligence and sensi-
tivity he displays in every other activ-
ity he performs or participates in.
This is, presumably, the way most
audiences behave at movies. It will,
I'm afraid mean nothing to such
audiences if I say that a movie, like
any other work of art, involves more
than anything else an active partici-
pation, even actual work, on the part |
of the viewer if the movies are going |
to be anything more than insipient |
tickling or a type of benign mes- |
merism. And our skins are getting |
thicker, and thicker; M.G.M. had to

The 7th hole fairway trap—a verit-
able Sahara—was rendered even more
treacherous by an underlining of
rocks and pebbles which hampered
and remolded the golf club.

The most nerve-shattering event
was putting on the lightning fast
greens. Parched and luscious, one

player was seen using a driver in an
attempt to reach the cup from his
forelorn position 5 feet from the cup.
All in all, it took a mighty blow to
reach the cup.

Exams

(Continued from page 1)
Committee to get one of the exams
changed to a more convenient date,
to be agreed upon mutually by the
student and the professor, As the
schedule now stands, a student must
have four exams or 11 hours of
courses in two days to petition
for a change.

Lee Halford, who headed the com-
mittee which made the proposal, em-
phasized that the committee will con-
tinue to study ways to introduce a
completely flexible exam schedule in
which students may decide when they
will take exam. For the moment, how-
ever, Halford and the EC agreed this
plan was the most practical.

These ideas are to be submitted to
the Faculty Committee on Courses
and Degrees on Tuesday.

Another facet of the proposal stated
that students taking a make-up exam
will be pledged not to talk about the
exam if the professor so desires. This
will keep a professor from having to
make out new exams for each student.

Herb Crenshaw, junior representa-
tive, wondered if this would confuse
the students ,since some professors
will ask for pledges and others will
not. It was pointed out that this
situation exists now for hour tests and
presents no apparent problems.

Further studies on how many stu-
dents this proposal will affect are to
be made before the final draft is pre-
sented to the faculty.

 

As the players staggered off the
course, lamenting about their scores
and nursing the multitude of wounds
inflicted by the flies, it became patently
obvious that the new golf season was
going to be not better or worse than

its predecessors.

‘STAFF EDITORIALS’

It will be a policy of the Tuesday Edition this year to allot space in its
editorial columns, from time to time, to staff members who have strong and
legitimate feelings on a topic with which they have become particularly familiar
as a result of their work for the Ring-tum Phi.

Almost by definition, an ambitious staff member becomes privy to a
“garden variety” of thoughts on certain matters, and it is the feeling of the
editor that when the staff member has developed a responsible editorial on
one of these certain topics, he ought to be given the privilege of whatever
“weight” the editorial columns of this paper carry.

In all circumstances, the editor—realizing he has final responsibility for
the content of the newspaper—will pass prior judgement on the suitablity
of each draft “staff editorial”; and because they will almost always express
points of view differing somewhat from his own, these occasional “staff edi-
torials” will be distinguished by the appearance of their writers’ intials at
their conclusions.

This policy is standard on most commercial newspapers and on nearly

Rush Reevaluated

The faculty’s action last week to postpone its ultimatum
to the IFC concerning deferred rush is a brief, but needed,
respite.

The IFC, after much study last year of the Washington
and Lee rush system and of the rushing techniques that exist
in many other universities, decided that the basic framework
must remain intact; early rush is the best of all possible worlds
—given the world of Lexington.

Last year the faculty rejected the IFC reforms without
giving them a chance to rise or fall on their own merits. It
appeared that the faculty had somehow set its collective mind
upon a deferred rush and would not settle for anything short
of that goal. There seemed to be an atmosphere of change for
change’s sake without an analysis of all the possible results.

Apparently, the high intellectual fervor for reform was
subjugated to an unfinished student union building. By a
rather dubious exercise in logic, it would seem that all that
W&L needs to rival the New England colleges is a student
union building. The function of this magical building would
be to fill the social needs of the freshmen until such times as
they are allowed to join fraternities. The proponents of a de-
ferred rush should seriously analyze the social needs of the
freshmen and whether the student union building can fulfill
these needs.

This year should see a reevaluation of the rushing system
at Washington and Lee. The following questions should be care-
fully considered by both the IFC and the faculty: Have the
IFC pledge activities reforms improved freshman scholastic
performance? Will the student union building fulfill the social
needs of the freshmen? If there is a deferred rush, what con-
trols will be put on freshman-upperclassmen contact? Will
deferred rush result in an improvement of the intellectual cli-
mate, or in a chaotic semester-long rush?

We can only hope that both the faculty and the IFC will
maintain open minds while evaluating the pro’s and con’s of
deferred rush.

have made outstanding academic

records and who are interested in
carrers in college teaching, should
investigate this program through

which they may be nominated by a
Washington and Lee faculty member
to become candidates as “Woodrow
Wilson Designates.” These nomina-
tions should be made directly to Dean
1. B. Cauthen, College of Arts and
Sciences, Cabell Hall, University of
Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia be-
fore October 31, 1967.

Employing the techniques of past
years and regional selection commit-
tees, the Woodrow Wilson Founda-
tion will designate 1,000 young per-
sons in the U. S. and Canada as
“best qualified as potential college
teachers,” and will identify another
1,000 winners of Honorable Mention.

Highly Competitive

A second, highly competitive cate.
gory will award 100 first year gradu-
ate fellowships to candidates from
United States colleges and universi-
ties, and 50 to Canadian institutions
This represents a drastic reduction in
the number of direct fellowship
awards of previous years,

Sir Hugh Taylor explained that the
1,000 top candidates, plus the list of
the Honorable Mention winners, will
be forwarded to deans of all graduate
schools, “many of whom have already
pledged to make offers of financial
assistance to the selected candidates.”

Despite the sharply reduced direct
Wodrow Wilson Fellowship awards,
this new and experimental program
deserves support, as helping eligible
Washington and Lee seniors to find

Clifton Forge Provides Four

Housemothers

By MICHAEL ALLDERDICE

It's not often that you get to chose
your own mother, though sometimes
it would be nice if we could. Within
the past year several fraternity houses
have had just that chance. Not only
did these ladies happen to be ex-
cellent house mothers, but it turned
out that four of them are from the
same town, Clifton Forge.

It seems that good news in Clifton
Forge travels fast, and the appeal of
the job caught on. The first two to
arrive were Mrs. M. C. Smith and
Mrs. H. R. Topping, who came to
WAL last fall. They were followed
by Mrs. M. S. Reynolds and Mrs, E.
E. Jeffries, who arrived this fall.

Into The Swing

The new Sigma Chi house mother,
Mrs. Smith, did not know anyone at
W&L when she first applied, and was
influenced by the reputation of the
school alone. More than pleased by
her surroundings here, “Mama Ru”
entered into the swing of things im-
mediately.

Like any other “freshman” she was
immediately confronted with rush
week and taken up with the hustle
and bustle of the occasion, Besides
helping decorate, she joined in on
some of the conversations during the
parties themselves. Having raised a
son and a daughter, she was pretty
well up-to-date on the discussions.

One of Mrs. Smith’s loves, being
an accomplished pianist herself, is
music. Her own grand piano is now
in the living room of the Sigma Chi
house, and she enjoys leading a song
or two during the breaks of the combo
parties. Another favorite activity is
attending our football games, which
she almost never misses. To show their
appreciation, the members of Sigma
Chi have made her an honorary sweet-
heart.

A New Challenge

Mrs. Topping had been a journalist
for 22 years before coming to the
Delta Upsilon house. Her main rea-
son for wanting to become a house-
mother was the need for a new
challenge and a change in the routine
of things.

A good friend of hers was a house-
mother at Madison, and let her in
on the ups and downs of being a
housemother. A mother of two sons,
both of whom are now married, Mrs.
Topping decided it would be better to
become a housemother at a boy's
school,

A football fan, Mrs, Topping plans)

to make most of the games this sea-
son, She is also very interested in
music. She plays the piano and organ,
sings in her church choir, and was in
the FROGS’ production of the “Mi-
kado.” Mrs. Toppings is also active
in the Business Professional Women's
Club, the Virginia Press Women, and
her garden club,

Quite A Hit
Although Mrs. Mildred Reynolds
has only been at the Sigma Nu house
since this September, she has already
made quite a hit there, She applied

For WGL

for the job soon after being informed
of the duties last spring vacation.
Once here she immediately pitched
in to help out the house during rush
week and was so taken into the spirit
of things that she put the fraternity’s
sticker on her Cadillac.

Having raised three children, she
knows how to get along with everyone
in the house. She enjoys her duties as
house mother and lets it be known
by participating in as many things as
possible. Last weekend she came to
the combo party and juked it up a
bit. In appreciation the combo dedi-
cated a song to her.

The Delts are very pleased with
their new house mother, Mrs. Jeffries.
At Clifton Forge Mrs. Jeffries was
active in church and YMCA work,

P.E. Department Needs
To Stress More Skills

By LARRY HONIG { Broup are token, consisting of exercises

which are part of no obvious organized
plan. The few minutes of hapazardly
chosen calisthenics during each period
serve only to fulfill the stubborn re-
quirement that the lower group “ex-
ercise more” than the others,

As if this in itself were not indica-
tion enough of poorly channeled
effort, students consequently spend
less time learning to play a_ sport
which they could continue outside the
class.

The freshman year, with minor ex-
ceptions, is a total waste. Few skills
are learned, fewer are mastered.

Expand Opportunities

The sophomore year is a fantastic
improvement. Participants of both
groups learn several skills. The draw-
back is that the length of time spent
learning each sport is prohibitive to
mastery.

The sophomore syllabus should be
expanded over the two years, with
each student learning a variety of
athletic skills. These skills would be
those which would make physical ed-
ucation periods something to antici-
pate, rather than eschew, such as
handball, golf, tennis, bowling, swim-
ming and gymnastics (including
weight-lifting).

The advantages to such a system
are twofold. Two months could be
alloted to each sport, in which time
the game or activity would be well
learned.

One is hard-pressed to find student
proponents of the physical education
program at Washington and Lee,
especially among freshmen and sopho-
mores whose participation is both
mandatory and unenthusiastic.

It is going to remain a fact of
undergraduate life, however, that two
years of physical training are required,
but there is no reason why the three
hours a week cannot be spent in learn-
ing skills and sports which will en-
courage lifelong athletic participation.

The sophomore program, which ap-
proaches this goal, is especially in need
of revision on one major point: the
arbitrary separation of students into
upper and lower groups, according to
performance on a four-day series of
tests.

Many Factors

There are so many factors affecting
the results of these tests that the total
score loses all meaning, except all the
extremes. A heavy beer-drinker during
Rush Week may run the mile 30
seconds under his average, which could
mean that for an entire semester he
will be in the lower group, a sort of
“remedial” physical education.

A cold in January before the tests
can have the same effect. Thus the
shape a student is in on these days
of testing plays far too decisive a role
in outlining his athletic program.

Despite the intent of those who
coach the remedial section, there is
no indication that weak students are
improved. The high score for the
triennial tests remains within a 100-
point range; the average score, which
determines the dividing line, varies
even less.

The point here is not that the
upper and lower groups are similar,
but that the determination of their
difference is but an end—not a means
toward outlining valuable physical ed-
ucation.

Attempts to improve the

Lasting Benefit

But by far the most positive benefit
is that after acquiring the acumen,
continuation would become voluntary
and enjoyable. For those whose physi-
cal prowess is not optimum, learning
to play handball and liking it is of
much greater value than a transient
course in badminton.

The test series should be retained
solely as an indicator to the coaches,
while the basis of grades would prop-
erly become participation, morale,
and ability to learn.

Centre FB Jerry Ingram hits impregnable blue defense.

By RIC BERARD
As I huddled amongst the brave

i band of spectators last Saturday, I

kept wondering if maybe someone
would get smart and call off the game
because of inclement weather. (I
mean, when no one stands for “Dixie,”
you know something's wrong!) But
unfortunately for Centre, no one heard
me.

You see, things didn’t go accord-
ing to plan for the visiting eleven on
Wilson Field where they bowed to
the Generals, 6-0. For the second
week in a row, Washington and Lee
outplayed, outhustled and out-lasted
the opposition to the delight of their
cold-storage audience.

Although scoring six points during
an entire afternoon is not that great,
it takes on highly respectable quali-
ties when you realize that: 1. the
touchdown was scored against last
year’s ninth-ranked small college de-
fense; 2. the Colonels of Centre had
won their first two games including,
the week before, a victory over a
CAC member, Southwestern; 3. Coach
Harmon's team had been the pre-
season picks to win the CAC champ-
ionship under the returning leadership
of last year’s all-CAC quarterback,
Joe Lamonica, and the entire starting
backfield; and, 4. the opposition scored
six fewer points than the Generals

Unlike last week, our passing game
wasn't exactly intimidating anyone
However, our running game picked-
up the slack as the Generals literally
ran Centre into the ground and the

clock out. Obviously, whatever book
Coach Harmon had on WAL failed |
to anticipate the successful offensive

charge between the two tackles which
soon suggested that the visitors might
not recover in time to turn the tide.
And to the regret of few pneumonia
cases present, this is precisely what
happened.

Yet as the game continued, the two
teams in fact played to a standstill in
all but two departments—desire and
defensive lines. Time after time the
key defensive play belonged to W&L.
And whether it was the interception
of Lamonica’s pass in our endzone
with 2:00 left to play in the first
half, the roguish banditry of anther
pass with 0:27 left in the game, the
forcing of a Centre fumble on their
own eleven yard line, or the gusty
plunges of McDavid, W&L really
wanted “No, 2.”

While there were many outstand-
ing players for Blue last weekend, we
owe our greatest thanks to the great
defensive line play of Messrs. Mc-
Junkin, Harris and MacKenzie who
combined to make Centre’s afternoon
here along one. Because of them,
the Colonel's highly-rated “I” became
impotent as they limited the opposi-
tions running game to but one play,
the sweep right. And after exercising
that option, poor Lamonica was fore-
ed into the air. Clearly, such an
alternative was not enough

This is not to say, however, that
Centre's bubble quickly burst. W&L
did not beat a weak, punchless, or
over-confident team. Off the records,
Centre was correctly favored. And
to their credit, it took the sound of
the final gun to convince them that
they were not the better team on the
field. Rather, it is say that W&L again
out-played a favored opponent and

fined pietism as “the distortion of
piety by attempting to individualize
it;” moralism as “the corruption of
morality by attempting to trivialize
it;” and, legalism as “the distortion
of legality by attempting to absolutize
Ny

Dr. Fletcher approves of the wither-
ing away of the classical or traditional
ethics which constitute the “old
morality.” The chief fault he finds
with the “old morality” is that people
become “so concerned about what is
right that they cannot seem to see
what is good.” Dr. Fletcher’s basic
premise on this stand is that no
action is inherently wrong. He be-
lieves that the rightness or the wrong-
ness of a human action lies in its
effect on the people involved, not
in the deed itself.

His second approach to the “old
morality’ was from the prevailing
trends in theological and phiolosophi-
cal discourse. He explained that the
updating of clasical ethics by the
Vatican Council marked the end of
the counter-reformation.

His beliefs stem from the conten-
tion that only love is universally good.
Dr. Fletcher feels that it is more im-
portant to love people, than to love
law.

Perhaps the greatest benefactor of

Mock Convention. The Mock Conven-
tion does not merely occur once every
fours years, it is going on constantly.
Preparations for the 1968 event
began in the fall of 1964, when an
interim coordinator and regional man-

rooms should be closed and suitcases
in cars should be locked in trunks.

The Dutch Inn was hardest hit,
much the same way as the New
Dorm was robbed two years ago on
the same type weekend. Cars behind
the gym and in Lee Chapel parking
lot were reported broken into during
the game. The situation at night with
the man scattered combo parties made
the patrolling very difficult.

The police suspect the robberies
were fairly well organized by out-
siders because of the magnitude and
lack of evidence found in Lexington.

drug abuse is spreading in America.
He noted that where durgs abuses,
other than alcohol, were once limited
to the lower calsses, they are now
spreading to middle and upper classes.

Dr. Williams divided the drugs he
spoke of into four groups: depres-
sants, including alcohol, barbituates,
and glue; stimulants, including caf-
feine and cocaine; hallucinogenic or
psychedelic drugs, including LSD,
mescaline, STP, bananas and liquid
nitrogen; and marijuana. All of these
drugs cause a form of drunkeness.

48 Students Named Recipients
Of R. E. Lee Research Grants

The recipients of this year’s Robert E. Lee Research grants have been
announced by Dean William W. Pusey. A total of 50 students, 16 less than
last year, have been named to work on 39 different projects under faculty
supervision, The number of projects announced thus far represents a drop
of seven from last year’s total.

The research fund was established in the fall of 1960, through a gift
of more than a quarter of a million dollars by the late Dr. Gustavus Benz
Capito, an alumnus of the class of 1899, The projects are either for the
purpose of assisting a professor in his research, or of varrying out a plan of
research under a professor’s supervision,

Since its inception, 413 students have participated in a total of 318
projects.

Each year, the Student War Memor-
ial Scholarship Fund Committee,
known as SWMSFC (pronounced
“swamps”) raises $1500 through var-
ious activities to give to the Univer-
sity in the form of a scholarship. This
scholarship is awarded to sons of
deceased veterans.

The organization raises funds by
selling cokes at the concerts during
big dance weekends and selling class
rings at the Coop. In addition, the
organization is in charge of the con-
cesisons for graduation invitations and
caps and gowns. The Committee re-
ceives a commission from each cap
and gown rented, as well as from
each graduation invitation.

Further revenues are accumulated
by means of checking coats at the
Fancy Dress Ball. An annual fall raf-
fle, with the drawing being held at
the halftime of the Homecoming foot-
ball game, raises more money. The
prizes for the raffle are donated by
the local clothing stores—College
Town Shop, Thomas Limited and
Alvin-Dennis.

Primary Eliminates Freshman Candidates;
First-Year, Law School Elections Monday

By DOWNS LITTLE

Thursday night, the seven run-off
candidates for the freshman offices
of Executive Committee, president,
and vice-president presented _ their
campaign speeches in Evans Dining
Hall.

rhese primary speeches offered the
candidates their first opportunities to
address the freshmen formally on the
issues of concern. Following the in-
troductory remarks by EC members,
Lee Halford and Herb Crenshaw,
various sponsors nominated their re-
spective candidates for office.

A tie vote for EC in Wednesday's
primary balloting between Henry
Harkley and Sky Lininger was run-
off after the speeches. Lininger was
the winner, amassing 88 votes to
Markey’s 67. Thus Lininger will
oppose Joe Tompkins for the fresh-
man EC post Monday.

Joe Tompkins asked that the pres-
ent Honor System be continued and
asked for more and better facilities
for independent students. He sug-
gested that the Gaines Society be
backed financially by the EC.

Lininger defined the EC powers
as administering the Honor Code and
as having diverse appointive powers.
Aside from favoring the keeping of
the Honer Code intact, he supported
having a maximum of two exams in

#!wo days instead of the present maxi-
mum of three in the same period.

be found on page 2.)

THE RING-TUM PHI

The Curriculum Committee

After several months of discussion and research, the stu-
dent Curriculum Committee finally took shape this week with
the appointment of seven students to the committee, including
former EC representative Lane Steinger as chairman.

Their job is probably the most unenviable one in the history
of EC subcommittees. There are no guidelines, no precedents
for them to follow. Investigations into the procedures and goals
of similar committees at other colleges have only emphasized
the rather obvious point that successful institutions else-
where cannot the transplanted whole to W&L. Steinger, who
originally proposed the creation of the committee, predicts
that its first year will probably be no more than a period of
“exploration” and “trial and error.”

The overall aim is one of “curriculum review”—an exami-
nation of the present curriculum from a student point of view,
leading presumably to suggestions for improvement in the
form of recommendations to the EC. A major part of the effort
will be polling student opinion on all courses and major, prob-
ably by such means as dividing the students up according to
their grades, issuing a general questionnaire, and taking random
surveys to obtain a cross-section of opinion. Hopefully, the
committee can also study means of encouraging intellectual
endeavor among students. The exact procedures and goals
will be outlined within the next few weeks by the EC.

The Curriculum Committee is going to suffer all the dis-
appointments and failures which inevitably cling to a tradition-
less committee with a very difficult and unpopular job. Several
faculty members have already voiced their contempt and dis-
like for the whole idea. To suggest that students are in any
position to judge the merits and faults of any course may
seem understandably ridiculous to an educator of many years’
experience. There is a very real danger that any proposal which
reaches the faculty from the student Curriculum Committee
will automatically receive an impatient and uninspired rejection.

Pushing from the other side will be a great many students
anxious to “get things done,” eager to win reform, and all
too ready to mistake careful deliberation by the committee for
inaction or weakness. The committee members may occasion-
ally have to watch out for the same symptoms in themselves;
it is a common failing among student leaders that they feel
uncomfortable unless they are constantly engaged in full com-
bat with something or other. (However, to judge from the
persons who were selected for the committee, we can safely
hope this will not be a problem.)

There was never a job which called for so much tact and
mutual patience. But the benefits which both students and
faculty may obtain from the committee’s gradual and un-
spectacular labor make it well worth the effort for both sides.

Sixteenth-Century Books Shown
In McCormick Library Display

botany, and a dull theological tract! friend of Robert E. Lee's who con-
by Martin Luther—they don’t add up| tributed the books to help replace

 

to a Very exciting reading list.

Look again. The “Life and Fables
of Aesop” which went on display this
week in McCormick Library is over
S00 years old. The botany book,
“Histoire des Plantes,” was published
in 1549 with the text in Greek, Latin,
and French. The theological tract
(Dye Andere Epistel S. Petri und Aine
S. Judas) was printed while Luther
was a hearty 41 years old, in 1524.

These and other works are part of
the university's rare book collection,
generally stored in the top stack level
of the library. “Some people say
they're not rare at all,” says Mr. Henry
Coleman, head librarian, “They're just |

 

old,” dating back in some cases to
the 1400's.
The collection has been formed

quests and donations, A significant)

those “lost” from the library during
the Civil War occupation of Lex-
ington.

Except for one time in the 1930's,
the full collection has never been
exhibited.

The “Life and Fables of Aesop”
is the work of Robert Etienne (Stepha-
nus), who played an important part
in the French Renaissance as a dis-
seminator of Greek and Latin works.

Oldest book on display is a Latin
“Works of Heinrich Bebel” (Heinrich
Bebel!?), dated 1509 and bound in
wood, with traces of an old metal

ilock still on it,

“Dionysius Lambinus of Monsireli,
professor of Greek literature in the
city of Paris,” prepared the text of
the Roman philosopher Lucretius’ “On

on display, in 1563,

Job

 

By NEIL KESSLER

Approximately 285 undergraduates
are receiving a total of $315,000 from
Washington and Lee University in the
form of loans and scholarship grants.

This represents the highest number
of students on aid in the history of
the school. This is also the largest
amount of money awarded by the
University for this purpose.

Participation in federal programs
and larger endowments have been re-
sponsible for the rise in the amount
of loans and grants,

The freshman class leads all others
in the number of students receiving |
aid. About 81 are in this category.
The sophomore class has 72 on aid,
while the junior class and the senior
class have 76 and 56 respectively.

Because new federal programs are
being instituted each year and the
attrition rate increases as the student
furthers his education, the freshman
class has the most students on aid.

Around $4,000 of the $315,000 is
straight loan from WAL. The rest is)
provided through various government |
programs. The government allows the!
University to give & maximum of
$63,750 in federal loans. Thus far,
$63,500 have been awarded

The federal government also pro
vides $28,000 to be given as straight
grants to all specified lower income
groups. There is an $800 maximum
of government grants which the school
jean give a student each school year

the financial aid program is being
met. “On the basis of the Parents’
Confidential Statement,” Noell said,
“all students showing a computed need
for aid will receive the full amount
necessary to finance their education.”

As the cost of higher education
rises each year, (tuition will go up
from $1,600 this year to $2,000 by
1970) more and more individuals will
find the need to acquire grants and
loans. WAL is keeping pace with
this need.

A Revealing Experiment

 

By BERNIE FELD

Last weekend's alumni conference
was a revealing and hopefully profit-
able experiment.
The purpose, as
Dean Edward C.
Atwood expressed
it, was “to bring
interested alumni
up-to-date on the
current status of
the university.”

The three-day
session centered
around talks given
by various faculty
members and “dia-
logues” between the faculty and the
alumni. A major feature was a lunch-

eon attended solely by alumni dele-
gates and a “wide variety of student
representatives ...to provide an un-
inhibited exchange of views between
alumni and students.”

Unfortunately most of the speeches
on academic excellence and the prob-
lems of maintaining a good faculty
seemed to go over the heads of most
of our alumni. The major topics which
the alumni were interested in ranged
all the way from fraternities to con-
ventional dress to fraternities,

As Dean Atwood judiciously ex-
presed it, “They were not nearly as
concerned over academic progress
and the faculty as conventional dress
and fraternities.”

One of the students who partici-
pated in the luncheon put it dif-
ferently: “Their attitude was pretty
poor. They felt freshmen ought to be
indoctrinated to conventional dress.”

According to another student,
“There was some very vocal opposi-
tion to changes in the fraternity sys-
tem, The only question about the
faculiy was with regard to the sub-
ject of fraternities.”

“Most of the questions were about
student life because that is what they
are concerned with.” Atwood said
“They are concerned with the "WAl
man whatever that is. They want to
reassured that there still is
‘WAL man”

The alumni did make one criticism
of fraternities which would seem
worth noting. Many were upset, it was
reported, “because underclassmen lead
fraternities,”

 

 

in contrast to “the good!

W&L. Having known some of the stu-
dents before coming to W&L, he
found it very easy to adjust and con-
sidered his job to be very interesting
and challenging.

Mr. Vurnex, who has an eight year
old daughter, Denise, is an avid fan
of football and an eager supporter
of W&L’s team. He predicted the first
two victories of the team and antici-
pates future winnings by both the
gridiron and basketball teams. Con-
cerning athletics, he feels that the
student support at W&L is badly lack-
ing and that the students should more
actively participate in the athletic
program.

 

Alumni Meeting Profitable

old days” when juniors and seniors
were in command, This “evolution”
of the fraternity system whether for
better or for worse, is well worth
thinking about.

Thus far from the assortment of
comments offered one would gather
that W&I alumni, or at least the
ones who gathered here this past
weekend, are anywhere from  con-
servative to hopelessly outdated, de-
pending upon your point of view.

This is hardly a revelation.

What is revealing and what is im-
portant is that these 60 alumni repre-
senting 35 alumni chapters did take
the trouble to spend three days here.

As Dean Atwood said, “Everyone
is interested in W&L—that's why they
were here.”

The educational purposes of the
conference hopefully succeeded. These
60 alumni representatives have at
least been exposed to the Washington
and Lee of today. At least partially
the images of 20, of 30, of 40 years
ago have been altered.

It is to be hoped that conferences
of this kind, held for the first time
this year, will become a traditional
yearly affair. Our alumni, as well as
others, need to be shown that W&L,
like everything else, changes.

Lynchburg

Opponents,” commented Coach Joe
Lyles after the game. “They outpassed
and outhustled us, but the score
could have easily been 4-3 our favor
instead of 3-2 theirs. Allen Craig's
goal in the first period was nullified
by an offsides call, and Scott Fechnay
should have been awarded a penalty
kick when he was knocked down
while going for a goal in the fourth
period,”

Ihe Generals opened the scoring
when Fechnay rifled in a penalty kick
1:26 into the game, but Lynchburg

|came back to tie things up in the

second stanza on Garunstiaga’s long-
range blast. No other scoring took
place in the first half, but Lynchburg
constantly threatened the Blue net.
by goalie Tom Mitchell
kept the Hornets off the scoreboard.

Constantly pressing the attack,
Lynchburg pulled away in the second
half on goals by Graves and Garunsti-
aga, his second of the night. W&l
finally made another dent in the scor-
ing column when co-captain Allen
Craig took a pass from lineman Jack
Horowitz and pushed across the Gen
erals’ second and final score.

“We had trouble in the middle of
the field all through the game,” Coach
Lyles declared. “We were playing
mostly sophomores and freshmen
there, and the lack of experience hurt.
Our passing was not sharp and, con-
sequently, our linemen never did get
any really good cracks at the goal.”

Lafayette, No. 3?

Generals Go North
For Leopard Hunt

By STUART PORTER

With two straight victories under
their belts, the W&L Generals take
a step up in competition this weekend
and travel to Easton, Pa. to tangle
with the Leopards of Lafayette. This |
game will mark the first meeting of |
these two teams. The contest will be |
broadcast over station WLUR-FM be-
ginning at 1 p.m. Kickoff is at 2 p.m.

According to Coach Lee Me-
Laughlin, this should prove to be
“our toughest game of the season,”
but the Generals have already upset
two previously favored teams. Ran-
dolph-Macon and Centre, so there
could be some surprises in store for
Lafayette fans,

Lafayete, which always has a rough
schedule, is 1-2 on the season, losing
its first two games to Harvard and

Hofstra, but then bouncing back last
Saturday to down a powerful Bucknell
squad, 21-6. The Leopards are finally
beginning to click as a team and there
is no doubt that the Generals will have
their hands full.

Leopard signal-caller Jerry Facciani
completed six of eleven passes for 69
yards last weekend, two of which were
to his favorite receiver, split end Dave
Robertshaw. On the ground, halfback
Robert Zimmer carried the ball 45
times gaining 160 yards.

General Casaulty List

Still hampered by injuries for W&L
are sophomore Johnny Nolan, de-
fensive secondary, and junior Hank
Wilson, defensive end. Nolan has a
bruised rib and Wilson, an injured
knee. Both boys were hurt in the

place the bottle-bearing machines
with cup-bearing machines by Mr.
Sumner, manager of the University
Supply Store. Mr. Sumner was
asked to look into the problem by
University Treasurer James White-
head, who told the R-t P, “dis-
posal of the bottles was the problem.
There was certainly no intention
to cheat anyone out of (four ounces
of) Coke.” Mr. Whitehead looked
into the possibility of a can-bearing
machine, but was informed that
cans would have to cost 15 cents,
and thus assumed the price to be
prohibitive. Mr. Whitehead further
stated that he knew nothing about
the problem, but made assurances
that “there is no reason why some-
thing can’t be worked out.” Evi-
dently, Messrs. Brooks, Twardy,
Morill, and the scores of freshmen
who signed the petition which is
posted on the Coke machine (see
picture, page 1) made no attempt to
investigate the problem, If any of
the letterwriters, or any other repre-
sentative of the freshman class
would see Mr. Whitehead in his
office in Washington Hall, we are
sure that the problem can be reeti-

with an outstanding effort we have a
chance against Lafayette.

We will be taking 54 players to
Easton. This seems like a large num-
ber, but as the late Jim Tatum said,
“You need a first and second team on
offense, a first and second team on,
defense. That's 44 and then you need
some substitutes.”

As you may know the game will
be carried live on W&L FM Radio.
Here’s to “Good listening!”

Scientfic

(Continued from page 3)
The practice of trading game films
has made every team familiar with
cach week’s opponent. No longer can
a crafty coach pull a sleeper or a
lonely end play and catch his op-
ponent napping. Chances are that he
has tried it before and the game films
reveal it. Also the reports of a modern
scout border in length on the eigh-
teenth century novel. Complete in de-
tail to the most insignificant points,
the scouting report tells what a team
did the previous week. When the col-
lege player takes the field on Satur-
day, no doubt he knows his personal
opponent by heart-name, _ height,
weight, hometown and pinmate.

Such careful preparation leads to
much more than familiarity, how-
ever. By careful indoctrination
coaches convince their teams that they
are “ready” mentally and physically,
an important play for getting a team
in that mythical state of mind, “up.”
The plea to “win one for the Gripper”
comes on the practice field rather
than just before the game today.

The Recruiting Game
Also, the intersectional aspects of
expanded college football recruiting

Football

program must be considered. Farm
boys in Texas and street fighters in
Detroit no longer trudge to good old
State U. with cleats in hand. The
cream of the crop sit back and wait
for the good offer. A case in point is
the Notre Dame roster (come on,
how many of those Poles, Italians,
and Irish do you think come from
Indiana) which reflects coach Ara
Parsegian’s skillful coast-to-coast re-
cruiting. This concept has juggled the
talent more than in the past, and
if it doesn’t cause teams to be equal
in ability, it at least allows some of
the smaller teams to come up with a
super-star who can lead them to
victories, and upsets.

For these reasons, the season's
traditional “Black Saturday,” when a
few top teams fall from the unbeaten
ranks, has become rather meaning-
less, for each Saturday is black for
someone, as often as not one of the
nation’s best. In closing, just a little
advice. Forget last year’s 51-0 score
in the Notre Dame-U.S.C. battle. You
can bet Coach John McKay has
studied game films till he thinks he is

|a movie critic. If someone gives you

Southern Cal and a couple of points,
grab your wallet quick.

a defensive halfback, has just rejoined
the team after a two week illness,
but will probaly not see action this
weekend.

If senior halfback Bill McDavid
plays against the Leopards as he did
against Centre and junior linebacker
John Wolf plays as well as he has
been playing all the season, the Big
Blue could provide some exiting radio
entertainment. Freshmen Lee Graham
and Drew Kumpuris who both started
in the Centre game at defensive left
halfback and linebacker, respectively,
may also give the Leopards something
to think about.

CAC Roundup

The season outlook seems bright for
the W&L eleven as far as the CAC
race is concerned. Centre, a pre- sea-
son choice to win top honors, has a
1-1 conference slate, its win a 20-19
cliff-hanger over Southwestern. Wash-
ington U., 1-0, also downed the Lynx
in a squeaker, won with a field goal
in the last eight seconds. Thus, if the
Generals can keep pulling together
as a team and make some minor im-
provements, they could just cop con-
ference honors this year. After all,
they've already shown that two up-
sets in a row are possible. Would you
believe three?

A common theme throughout the
candidates’ addresses was class unity.
This was first stressed by vice-presi-
dential hopeful, Rick Osborne. Os-
borne emphasized that the power of
the vice-president was not useless and
should be used to fullfill the duties
of the office.

Ronnie Hunt, the second candidate
for vice-president, said that each fresh-
man could “make or break the class”
and that the actions of the class would
be reflected in those of the individual
student. “This,” said Hunt, “is what
makes class unity so important.”

Both presidential candidates, Jim
Carpenter and Jack Cartwright, again
echoed the needs of class unity.
Among the changes for W&L cited
by Carpenter were the formation of
a Freshman Avisory Council “to hear
complaints by and against members
of the class,” the reinstitution of the
WAL Club to help stimulate spectator
participation in sports, and the fur-
nishing of the freshman dormitory
reading rooms “so they might be ac-
ceptable in receiving dates.”

Cartwright emphasized the neces-
sity of maintaining the Honor System
intact, as well as the traditions of
gentlemanly dress and behavior. He
also stated that the president should
serve as the link between the fresh-
man class and the administration.

Final selections of president, vice-
president and EC will be Monday
for the freshmen in the undergradu-
ate and law schools. Polls will be
open in the Freshman Quad from 8
am. until 2 p.m. Nominations for
freshman Law School officers will be
made from the floor Monday night
at 7 p.m. in Tucker Hall and will
be followed by speeches and ballot-
ling.

 

Soccer Team Loses

(Continued from page 3)

The only truly satisfying W&L per-
formance was turned in by goalie
fom Mitchell, who, according to his
coach, “played the finest game in
goal of any collegiate soccer player
| have ever seen.” Mitchell made
twenty-three saves, including fifteen
of above-average difficulty, as com-
pared to only six saves by the Lynch-
burg goalie. “In Mitchell, WAL has
a definite candidate for All-America,”
Lyles declared.

The Generals meet Wililam and
Mary tomorrow at 3:00 p.m, in Lex-
ington. Coach Lyles, while not openly
predicting a victory, seemed confi-
dent. “We are in right now what
you might call the ‘twilight’,” he said.

(Continued from page 2)

I will base my stand on these issues:

1) The honor system should be
supported as it stands. Any change
in the finality of honor trial decisions
would result in a weakening of the
honor system.

2) Every effort should be made to
improve conditions for independent,
non-fraternity students. The indepen-
dents make up 20% of the student
body and their interests should not
be neglected. Arrangements should be
made so that independents have the
opportunity to enjoy the fullest pos-
sible campus life.

3) School spirit and student partici-
pation should be stressed. The sup-
port for athletic events should be
augmented by the formation of a
pep band and other spirit organiza-
tions who would regularly attend
W&L athletic events.

4) The Executive Committee should
push the construction of badly needed
facilities along with the improvement
of present buildings. Particular em-
phasis should be placed on a new
field house, adequate parking facilities,
and better equipped dormitories.

5) Compulsory Sophomore dorms
should be opposed b ythe Executive
Committee. Sophomores should have
the right to choose where they want
to live.

6) The possibility of allowing fresh-
men to have cars must seriously be
considered. The installation of the
delayed rush system will make this
necessary in order for freshmen to
have access to the campus and sur-
rounding areas. The Dean of Students
has stated that this proposal is worthy
of consideration. In summary, I be-
lieve that these six ideas are a starting
point for future expansion, They are
not the limit of our possibilities.

With your help and your support,
we can together lead the class of
1971 towards a lasting and beneficial
contribution to the betterment of
Washington and Lee.

Secondly, | completely support the
idea of giving funds to the Rugby
Club. Right now, a member of the
Rugby Club must supply and maintain
his own equipment. Since the club
does represent Washington and Lee

should be given to them.

Next, I am against the idea of
compulsory Sophomore Dorms. |
think that a sophomore should be
able to make up his own mind whether
he wants to live in a dorm, in a
fraternity house, or in an apartment.

I am in favor of improving the
facilities of the non-fraternity men.
With twenty per cent of the student
body not in fraternities, an effort
should be made to improve and en-
large recreational facilities in the near
future.

Also, each year, one freshman is

dent body. | will personally talk to
each person who applies to these com-

Student Driving Restrictions

Concern over student driving has become a major topic of
discussion in Virginia. Beginning with a series of editorials in
the Richmond Times-Dispatch the discussion has spread to the
editorial page of the Lexington News-Gazette. The controversy
is now brought to Washington and Lee.

We feel that the editorial in last week’s News-Gazette, if
associated with the letter to the editor on the same page, de-
serves comment. (The implications of the letter are examined
in a story elsewhere on this page.)

In the News-Gazette editorial, ‘‘Student-Owned Auto-
mobiles,” there is a reprint of the three principles upon which
the Times-Dispatch basses its “opposition to student cars.”
The editorial’s first point is that college is already very ex-
pensive and that status requires every student to have a car.
W&L is a good example that this is not the rule. Many students
can easily afford cars, and those who can’t don’t suffer because
the affluent lend them. Furthermore, if there were no cars,
there are other expensive sources of status.

Secondly the quoted Times-Dispatch editorial contended
that on weekends the students leave en masse, frequently
neglecting studies and maiming and killing themselves in smash-
ups. The car is not the only excuse for neglecting studies. There |
are hundreds of temptations, from television to women. Every
student can tell you another way to pass time. As for accidents,

This is the first of a two-part
series on past presidents of the Uni-
versity. —Editor.

A valorous attempt to construct a
composite of Washington and Lee
presidents has failed. Since the in-
corporation of the University in 1782,
only one factor about the presidents
has been constant. All fourteen were
political Democrats,

Geographic Variety

It cannot be said they were born
in the South because two were from
Pennsylvania and one was from Brit-
ish Guiana, South America. The liv-
ing presidents during the War Be-
tween the States did not even side
with Robert E. Lee—two moved to
Philadelphia for the duration, Occu-
pationally there is a hodge-podge
from the clergy to the political realm.
They were not all unactive in revolu-
tionary movements, as one led a de-
tachment while serving as president
of the College in the American Revo-
lution. And one was even arrested
for taking part in mob activity of

the other modes of travel are dangerous themselves. The two |

alternatives, with fewer cars, would be to dangerously overload
the cars or force students to hitch-hike with all of its related
dangers.

The editorial’s third point is that campuses are becoming

 

cluttered with cars; this will remain the case until “action is
taken to prohibit most students from having automobiles.” |

|
|

Washington and Lee has already taken a realistic approach to |

this problem with its restrictions. All freshmen, students on
academic probation and students on scholarships are prohibited
from having cars in Rockbridge County. Besides alleviating
the clutter problem our restrictions realistically meet the first
two points in the Times-Dispatch editorial.

The handicaps of seeking status most threaten students on
scholarship. The restrictions quickly eliminate the temptation
to buy a car. And study neglect is the rationale behind the
prohibition for academically poor students.

The News-Gazette suggests that only seniors be allowed
to have cars and that there be scholastic restrictions. The first
suggestion is not realistic for Washington and Lee, and the
second is already in effect.

The Sunday Times-Dispatch praises the Princeton plan
for the nation. At Princeton the students are not allowed to
have cars within the city limits of the town or on the campus
of the University. This would be ideal, but is rather unfeasible
for our situation and nearly every other we have experienced.
We do agree with the additional parking lots suggested in the
editorial; and the University will soon have to expand its pres-
ent facilities.

Over the years our restrictions have been criticized as being
too severe, but in the light of the present discussion, they are
realistically progressive and fair. —J.W.

Unsuccessful Effort

| The effort to prophesy or predict
| the next president has been unsuc-
| cessful. But if past presidents can teach
us anything, it is that our new one
has a lot to live up to.

 

In the historical development of the
university, the beginning was 1749 as
Augusta Academy by Robert Alex-
ander under the guidance of the Pres-
byterian Church. This school of the
industrious Scotch-Irish was in 1774
headed by Rev. William Graham
Graham was from Paxton Township,
Pennsylvania and had graduated in
1773 from Princeton. His classmates
included James Madison and Henry
“Light Horse Harry” Lee, father of a
later university president. He helped
coach Lee in philosophy and was
credited by him for his passing

William Graham was presiding
when the name of the school was
changed to Liberty Hall in 1776 as
an act of independence he stepped
forward, drawing others who elected
him captain of the company. But the
detachment was never called to battle.
In 1782 the Virginia Legislature in-
corporated the school so that it could
award degrees. Before he retired from
il! health in 1796, Graham began the
construction of the stone school on a

Washington's Bequest

George Washington in 1796 donat-

Company stock to the school, and in
1798 the school honored its greatest
benefactor by changing the name to
Washington Academy.

A 1788 graduate of Liberty Hall

had a large practice throughout the
valley. He further served as treasurer
of the Hall until 1803, and his four
sons all graduated from the school.

George Addison Baker was the next
president for thirty years of progress.
He had been trained under William
Graham at Liberty Hall and was a
preaching evangelist. In 1798 he re-
turned to the school as chairman of |

came president. In 1803 the school
was moved to its present location as

a cost of $9,000. Dr. Baker retired
in 1829 to his pastorate in Lexington,
but in 1835 he spent the last year of
his life president of Hampden-
Sydney College.

Educated Abroad

The fourth president was Louis
Marshall, youngest brother of Chief
Justice John Marshall. He was born
in Fauquier County, Va., but was edu-
cated in Edinburgh and Paris, where
he studied medicine. As a student in
Paris during the early years of the
Revolution he witnessed the massacre
of the Swiss guards, was present at
the storming of the Bastille, and was
accused to have participated in the
violence of the mob in Paris. It was
reported he was arrested and con-
demned to death, but was saved by
the influence of his brothers. He later
never spoke of this period.

A letter in the current issue of the
Lexington News-Gazette has caused a
storm of controversy. The letter was
“mainly concerned with the increas-
ing number of serious automobile
accidents involving local college stu-
dents, particularly those at Washing-
ton and Lee University,” according
to its writer,

The letter was obviously a sincere
plea for highway safety but the blame
| for accidents was obviously unfairly
and incorrectly placed on W&L stu-
dents. The Rev. Albert J. Schrader,
pastor of the Trinity Methodist Church
and chaplain of the Lexington Rescue
Squad, is the author of the letter, and
has had to witness many serious acci-
dents. The viewing of one accident

school. He was appointed president
of the College in 1830 and resigned
in 1834, In 1835 he became president
of Transylvania College in Lexington, |
Ky., and in 1866 he died at his home
in Woodford.

Henry Vethake was born in Es
sequibo, British Guiana in 1792, and
moved to the United States when very
young. He was graduated from Co
lumbia College, and the University ol
the city of New York before coming
to Washington College in 1834. He
taught intellectual and moral philoso
phy while president, but in 1836 went
to the University of Pennsylvania and

Revealing Statistics

Rev. Schrader calls for action to
deal “with the ever-increasing prob-
lem of drinking and driving.” Accord-
ing to the records of the Lexington
Police Department from 1963 through
May, 1967, 133 local citizens have
been arrested for reckless driving.
WAL students accounted for 51 of
these. And 63 local citizens have been
convicted for “driving under the in-
fluence.” Significant, only five of
these have been WAL students. This
is a notable record in that only seven

Past University Presidents Present
Various Backgrounds Of Leadership

New York he established the first
Sunday school in that city. In 1831
he was elected Moderator of the
Presbyterian Synod of Philadelphia
and in 1832 founded Lafayette Col-
lege.

Because of pecuniary difficulties, in
1841 he accepted the presidency of
Miami of Ohio University. He left
after three years in protest of aboli-
tionist sentiment and brought twenty-
six of his students with him to Wash-
ington College where he became pres-
ident in 1848. He held office until
the war in 1861 when he resigned.

John C. Calhoun praised Dr, Jun-
kin’s speech on slavery in the South
before the Synod of Cincinnati as “the
best defense “he had ever read.”

Dr. Junkin sympathized ardently
with the South, but, not believing in
state rights, and being the son of an
officer in the Revolution who had
shed his blood for the American
Union, he could not join in the seces-
sion movement. One of his daughters
married CSA Gen. Thomas J. “Stone-
wall” Jackson in the house on the
University campus closest to New-

comb Hall.

WGL Drinking, Driving
Receive Disputed Criticism

lhe letter offers suggestions to cope
with this “drinking and driving prob-
lem”:

1.) The entire student body should
be required to attend lectures on the
problem once a semester, This is un-
necessary because the students, under-
graduates and law, already under-
stand the seriousness,

2.) Fraternity and official socials
should be supervised by the admini-
stration and intoxicated students
should be kept from driving. The Uni
versity already requires administra-
tion-approved housemothers to be
present at all parties, and the driving
problem is almost completely handled
by the students. Students do watch
out for their dates, and if a driver
is intoxicated he will either voluntarily
or forcibly be replaced by a sober
student. This happens almost every
weekend at every house

3.) Drinking and driving regulations
for students should be made more
stringent, This police job, not
in the realm realistic University
control.

is a
of

4.) Possession of automobiles should
be prohibited to the junior year and
a bus system should be instituted, Al!
freshmen, students on scholarship and
academic probation are now prohibit-
ed from owning cars. There already
is an IFC bus system to the nearby
schools, but the girls prefer to ride
in cars—and insist on it. It is true
that over 95 per cent of students
eligible to own cars do own them, but
with so many now excluded, these
are in demand.

5.) The student union should be
immediately constructed and an on-
campus social program be instituted.
The ground-breaking for immediate
consiruction was yesterday, October

Booters Overwhelm WEM

By RIC BERARD

On a sun-drenched Smith Field last
Saturday, Washington and Lee’s soccer
team evened its record at 2-2 as it
defeated William and Mary by the
score of 7-0. But, as in all sports,
it wasn’t whether we won or lost
that was important; rather, how we
played the game.

You see, the Generals forgot their
accommodating role of the proper
host and instead vaporized the opposi-
tion that day before another larger-
than-intimate partisan gathering.

For although our visitors gave it the
old college try, this was only the
second year that they have even field-
ed a soccer team, and the first year
that their “coach” has ever known
that twenty-two men a football game
do not always make. Clearly, this
contest was another example of the
clever scheduling which we have all
come to know and love here at W&L.
As one of our soccer players correctly
stated after the game, “Our freshmen
could have beaten those guys.”

Yet it seems certain that this year’s

soccer team, following its question-
ably decisive victory over their Wil-
liamsburg opponents, will not be roll-
ing over any good team in quest of
another winning season. We are simp-
ly lacking the experience and, at times,
individual hustle, in order to be a
real threat to anyone good. If we are
to have a winning season this year,
then we shall have to continue to
defeat teams such as William and
Mary.

However, as Wililam and Mary
will readily concede, W&L does not
lack talent. And it is this factor which
should allow us to improve on our
present .500 record. For guided by
the superior play and leadership of
co-captains Craig and Harold, and
Seniors Tooker and Burroughs, the
Generals are building. And to this
end, Juniors Fechnay, Simmons and
Mitchell will be of great assistance
since few teams are going to shut out
Fechnay in any game and just as
few will be able to match the good
defensive play of fullback Simmons
and goalie Mitchell. In addition,
Sophomores Yow and Jamison and
Freshman Chyatt will add to our
offensive threat and ball control if
they continue to improve. But please,
don't look for any upsets this fall by
our Smith Field eleven—they need
to season a little more.

Saturday, then, was a day of vic-
tory and improvement for a W&l
team with first-rate potential, Against
a weak opponent, the offense learned
what it’s like to score often without
really trying, while the defense began
to jell in a shutout effort. And the

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspapet

Ah, Elections

While we were watching the progress of freshman elections
last week, it occurred to us that historians and sociologists may
be neglecting a great mine of historical and sociological in-
formation by not devoting their time and typewriters to studies
of collegiate political campaigns. Every year we get a new
“History of the Republican (or Democratic, or Socialist)
Party,” or an in-depth “Report Upon 1964 Electoral Voting
Patterns in Kaufman Co., Tex.” And yet, national and even
local elections are usually run with such a smooth profession-
alism that there is a depressing sameness and tameness about
them all. (It makes little difference, really, whether the candi-
date was supposed to have been born in a log cabin on the
Mississippi or in a log ranch house on the Pedernales.)

Nothing, on the other hand, is so lively as an amateur
production—especially an amateur election. By definition, it
involves no professionalism, which means you can always expect
surprises, last-minute reversals of fortune, thrills, incredible
blunders, occasional skullduggery, and above all, real inventi-
veness. The sort of thing you get in any college electoral
campaign. And, of course, among electoral campaigns the best
and the most worthy of study are undoubtedly freshman elec-
tions, when the amateurs are really amateurs.

Future historians of the decline and fall of American youth
would do well to pay more heed to the comparative history of
college elctions. The conduct and misconduct of elections,
the emphasis given to different positions and platforms in
different eras, and slogans which ornament every election,
might keep the doctoral theses coming for decades. How many
psychological studies could be drawn from such campaign
calls as “Grivit, Grivit’” (Spring 1967) or ‘‘(Candidate X)
for Apathy” (Fall 1967)? How many philosophical tracts
could be composed over the paradoxes of “Elect Henry C.
Hawk” (Fall 1967) ?

The whole history of the intellectual attitudes of W&L
students is almost summed up in the history of their elections.
It was one kind of freshman class which wrangled in 1910 over
who would be captain of the pushball team in the annual
sophomore-freshman pushball game (a very prestigious post).
It was quite a different kind of freshman class which in the
early 30’s used to elect the most unpopular “goat” in the class
to the presidency, parade him through the streets, and compel
him to address the mob from the balcony of the Robert E.
Lee Hotel or from the bar in McCrum’s Drug Store. And it
was another freshman class altogether which as recently as
1964 broke the “clique system’’ and ended a thirty years’ war
between two rival groups of fraternities.

Do we detect a note of progress there somewhere—from
pushball to clique-breaking? And while the romantics among
us may deplore the passing of the good old days of elections
here, when freshmen rioted in Lee Chapel (1950) and en-
raged janitors were sweeping up 750 campaign posters a day
from the floors of the dorm (1930), we might also take
comfort from the thought that student government has come
a long way in the direction of maturity and responsibility.

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

 

Yafass

lo The Editor
Dear Sir:

Have you ever heard the braying
of a Yafass? It resembles that of a
mule; the two animals are also alike
in planting their feet and defending

the status quo. They are different,
though. The Yafass often proposes
hilariously funny old approaches to

new problems.

Some entertaining reading awaits
you in a Yafass humor publication
modestly named “Truth” (obtained on
a northern campus). For some reason
(linguistic conservatism?), they coyly
prefer the Latin “Veritas.” This humor
publication strongly resembles and
may be a take-off on, another comic
newspaper also named “Truth”—in
that they both make ludicrously fan-
tastic statements in a perfectly serious
tone. Veritas at least equal Pravda
in this entertaining form of subtle wit.

Job Discrimination

In a current issue, there is an in-
genious proposal for preserving what
only a Yafass could consider a great
old American tradition worth keep-
ing: job discrimination. Their argu-
ment (2, 1, September 11, 1967, p. 3)
is:

“Liberals are forever claiming to
be the champions of the cause for
jobs for Negroes. Yet these same lib-
erals are calling for repeal of section
14B of the Taft-Hartley Act. Section
14B protects the right of a state to|
outlaw the union shop. The union)
shop requires that an employee join|
the union within 30 days after start-|
ing work. It is no secret that many|
labor unions discriminate with regard |
to race, yet liberals say that if a man}
is employed where there is

 

a union, |
he should be required to join, But if
the union refuses to accept Negroes, |
then the Negro will never be hired}
in the first place, thus losing out on}
a job.

“Conservatives on the other hand,
maintain that it is the right of an in-|
dividual to join or not join a union)
as he sees fit. We do not want section
14B repealed, Under the conserva-|
tive approach the Negro could take)
the job. he would not be
forced to join the umon a condi
tion of employment

because

as

The liberal approach, then, works
against the Negro, denying him his
right to work, whereas the conservative
method preserves individual integrity
by guaranteeing this vital right. So
the next time a liberal tells you how
over the Negro un
ask him about 148
Then watch his concern turn to anger |
the

concerned he is
employment rate
he changes subject.”

The idea is to keep |

Negroes in the most menial and

Who indeed? Not the writers of
Veritas. This quotation points up a
frequent defect in the humor of
Veritas (frequent also in Pravda): The
tone is sometimes so sincere that you

have an unpleasant, fleeting impres-
sion that the writers actually believe

in the fantastic statements that they
make. The wit tends to wear a little
thin in spots; this is often the case
when Veritas deals with the Negro

question,

Whey is this so? It appears that here
they really have a genuine concern,
they have reason to fear that the
wish of Lester Maddox will be ful-

filled in reverse. If Negroes ever col-

lect on the century-old Federal
promise of “forty acres and a mule,”
since the resemblance between a
Yafass and a mule is so great, as
I pointed out in the beginning, it is
not improbable that many Negroes
will end up owning forty acres and
a Yafass!

In the meantime, let us enjoy the
Yafasses’ off-beat band of humor.

To The Editor of the Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

The purpose of this letter is to ex-
press my regrets concerning the broad-
cast of the Lafayete game last week
on WLUR. The play by play account
of the game was done excellenily.
However, most of the comments about
the game and the team were in very
poor taste. Mr. Lupton’s comments

| were a very bad representation for

WAL and would have been out of
place anywhere, let alone over the
radio,

I'm just thankful WLUR could be
heard only in this area. | hope that
the next game broadcast over WLUR
will be an improvement over last
week's.

On Student Union

By PAUL ATWATER

Monday was the first day of con-
struction on the new building that will
join the present student union and
Evans dining hall, creating greatly ex-
panded facilities for student activity
and recreation. Removal of the tile
patio and large tree next to the dining
hall are but the first steps in the work
that is expected to be completed
around February of 1969, From. its
exterior appearance, the new addi-
tion will take the place of the col-
lonade that now connects the existing
building and will have a_ gabled
entrance with windows on either side.
Furthermore, the sidewalk will be in-
dented to allow passengers to be let
out and picked up from their cars
without hindering traffic.

Interior Features

Of the many interior features of the
building the most popular will no
doubt be the as of yet unnamed tavern
of the rathskellar variety, and the
recreation room with its billiard tables,
et. al. The “tavern” (the term that
the administration has dubbed it for
the present) will be located on a sub-
terranean level under the present
patio.

At the far end of the large room
(around 70 x 40 feet) there will be a
bar with the traditional stools and
bar rail. The answer to the question
you are all wondering about is “yes;”
beer (3.2) will be served there. Be-
sides its large area for dancing,
another feature of this wood panneled
room will be booths and tables sep-
arated from the dance area by a
partition of wood railings.

For added entertainment there will
be a juke box, piano, and possibly
television. The large dance area will
also be able to accomodate combos
(if there is enough student interest and
participation to financially support
one).

The recreation room will adjoin the
“tavern” and will take the place of
the old bookstore (a commendable
substitution). The other facilities of
this floor level are the Glee Club,
Brass Choir, and other music practice
rooms which will remain largely as

 

 

 

 

they are now. The present office of
the Calyx staff, however, will be
moved, most probably to the third
floor.

Second Story

The second story will show some
striking changes. The wall that sepa-
rates the lounge and television room
will be removed, thus making a very
large reception room which will have
any number of varied uses. Moving
further back into the building, the stu-
dent activity room that is adjacent to
the present patio will be converted into
a comfortable library and sitting room.
Behind this, the old Co-op will be a
room devoted to Executive Commit-
tee meetings and also serve as a
place for honor trials. There will be
constructed four small witness rooms
to the very rear of the building.

The new addition between the two
existing buildings on the present patio
level will be used as another student

said that one of the latest things is
to have the sculptor draw up plans
for his work, and then send them off
to a factory to have it made. Made
in this manner, the modern “primary

are geometric-like structures, rather
than linear.

Symphony Plans
Concert Pro gram
For November 1

Ihe Rockbridge Concert Theatre
Series will feature the National
Symphony, which has just returned
from a very successful European tour,
on November 1. The concert, which
is already a sellout, will be presented
in the VMI field house at 8:15 p.m.

On the afternoon of the concert,
the National Symphony will perform
gratis for the Rockbridge County pub-
lic schools. The afternoon concert will
afford those who do not have tickets
for the evening performance a chance
to hear the symphony.

Five Composers

The work of five different compos-
ers will be represented in the program.
Beethoven's “Egmont Overture” will
be the first number, followed by a
work of Purcell and Barbirolli en-
titled “Suite for Strings, Horns, Flutes,
and English Horn.” Barber's “Medeas’
Meditation and Dance of Vengeance”
and Copeland’s “Symphony No, 3”
will conclude the program.

There are two more programs
scheduled this year in the Rockbridge
Concert Theatre Series. Sometime this
winter, the Lywen String Quartet will
perform, and on April 8, the series
will feature Teresa Stich-Randall.

 

Lexington admired paintings in last Saturday's Rockbridge Outdoor Art
Festival. The festival took place in Courthouse Square.

 

 

Discussion of Vietnam Situation

Sunday night the University Fed-

Wesley Foundation presented at the
Wesley House Mr. John Fielder, an
instructor of philosophy at Washing-
ton and Lee, who spoke on “The
American Involvement in Vietnam.”

Mr. Fielder is chairman of the Lex
ington Committee on Vietnam, a local
anti-Vietnam war group, and in his

DuPont Hall Exhibits
Feature New Painter

Abstract impressionistic paintings
by French artist Antoine Pentsch are
on exhibit in the duPont Art Gallery
for a month-long showing.

Pentsch, artist-in-residentnce _ this
semester at Mary-Baldwin College, is
a former student of Stanley William
Hayter, internationally known con-
temporary print-maker.

Born at the Royal Palace in Buda-
pest, Hungary, Pentsch has been a
resident of Paris since his family
moved there for political reasons
shortly after his birth.

Since the early 1950's, Pentsch has
been showing his paintings and prints
in the largest competitive art exhibits
in France, England, Canada, Ger-
many, Belgium, Sweden, Israel and

ithe United States.

Indication of New Trends

Marion Junkin, chairman of the
Department of Fine Arts, commented
that this showing of Pentsch’s work is
excellent as an indication of what
young artists in France, and the rest
of Europe as well, are doing today.
He pointed out that, while there is
a little influence evident in Pentsch’s
art of other artists of the School of
Paris such as Jean-Paul Riopelle and
Bernard Schultze, there is almost no
evident influence of American artists.
The European arists, like the European
car-manufacturers, said Dr. Junkin,
are more interested in becoming pro-
ficient in their particular style, and
developing that style, than in creating
an uproar by outdoing those before

Will Speak In Lee Chapel

Walter W. Heller has been sched-
uled to speak at Washington and Lee.
The University of Minnesota pro-
fessor of economics will speak in Lee
Chapel on November 10 at 12:05,

Heller is sponsored by the School
of Commerce and Administration and
will tentatively speak on “Prosperity,
Inflation, and the New Economics.”

Kennedy Advisor

The 52 year old economist received
his AB from Oberlin and his MA and
PhD from the University of Wiscon-
sin. He was appointed Chairman of
the Council of Economie Advisors in
1961 by President Kennedy. He served
in that office until the fall of 1964.

Time magazine described Heller as
“the most influential chairman in CEA
history and probably had the presi-
dential ear as exclusively as any other
single economist in U. S. history.”

Heller was born in Buffalo and
raised in Milwaukee. After being grad-
uated from the University of Wis-
consin, he worked during World War
Il in the Treasury Department. He
has also served as fiinancial advisor to
the U. §. Military Governor, Lucius
Clay, in occupied Germany.

Alters Economy

While he was Chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisors, Heller,
in effect, altered the economic direc-
tion of the country by winning first
Kennedy, then Johnson, over to the
philosophy of deficit spending as a

Heller was also successful in con-
vincing President Kennedy to support
a tax cut policy to guard the economy
against inflation.

him as “the present-mined professor
who tempers earnestness with cordi-
ality and intellect with a touch of
ambitious worldliness.”

Cast Announced

For New Play
By Troubadours

The tentative cast for the up-com-
ing production of the Troubadours
was announced last week. The players
n “The Empire Builders” will be Nan
Duvall as the Mother, Page Dunn
as the maid, Katie Lyle as the
daughter, Zenobia, Noel Clinard as
the Schmurtz, Evan Jefferies as the
Neighbor, and Lawrence McConnell
as the Father.

Rehearsals began last Thursday
under the direction of Mr. Lee Kahn.
the play, which is to be performed
November 1-4, is a comic-tragedy
concerning a man's efforts to elude
the pain he finds in the world. In
doing so, he forces his family to flee
continually from the unknown by
moving from floor to floor within
their own house. At the close of the
play, the man comes face to face
with his reality of isolation, and finds
he has no inner strength with which
to face the adversities the world hurls
at him.

“This play.” said Mr. Kahn, “will
not be an easy one for the actors
lo perform.” This is only the second
time this play is being produced in
this country after being successfully
staged in Europe

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

Tuesday, October 24, 1967

 

... And professors who hand
them back on Parents’
Weekend are even worse.

Before we move into the coming Weekend (with a capital
“W’), there’s one matter we'd like to dispose of regarding
the past Weekend (also with a capital ““W”’). To wit, hour
quizzes.

A significant number of students had hour quizzes Staur-
day morning of Parents’ Weekend—and were forced to choose
between studying (requiring their parents to wander by them-
selves Friday night on their own) and accompanying their
parents (courting disaster on the next morning’s test).

Parents’ Weekend is, among other things, an intensive
public-relations vehicle for the University, directed towards
those who supply the lion’s share of the students’ financial
contribution to their education. Parents do not travel to Lex-
ington, Virginia, to watch their sons study for hour tests, nor
to see their sons take them. Parents’ Weekend is, in addition,
a time when parents are (hopefully) coerced into parting with
vast sums of money—to Contact, to the Mock Convention,
even to the Ring-tum Phi (but we didn’t schedule an hour
quiz). Parents’ Weekend was this year, and always has been,
scheduled far enough away from midterm so as not to conflict
with midterm tests. Parents’ Weekend is, all in all, a most in-
appropriate time to give hour tests.

Yet, in biology alone, 63 students had to take a quiz Satur-
day morning. And a biology hour quiz is not something one
avoids studying for. (We had a bit of trouble learning just
how many students do take Biology 1 and 101: the registrar
said finding out would entail counting names on enrollment
lists, and that would take too much time; subsequently, though,
we found the statistic at the University switchboard in a booklet
of enrollment figures for every W&L course—a booklet that
had been distributed by the registrar’s office.) There were other
courses in which students had hour tests Saturday, too—there
seem to have been at least as many hour quizzes on Saturday
of Parents’ Weekend as on any other Saturday in the year.

This took place at the same University where the faculty
not only refrains from giving tests on dance Weekends but
calls off classes altogether. We aren’t even—not now—arguing
against all Saturday quizzes. Just against the ones given when
the students and their University would be better off for avoid-
ing them.

Minister Renews Discussion

OnWGEL Drinking-Driving

that the age of 25 is considered the
leveling-off age for male maturity
of emotion and judgment. It is com-
mon knowledge that few if any Ameri-
can insurance companies will grant
auto insurance to male drivers under
age 25 for the same rate as drivers
over age 25. For most companies the
premium rate is double for the male
under age 25 as contrasted with the
cost to persons over age 25. Where

by THE REV. A. J, SCHRADER
Trinity Methodist Church

The week following this writer's
letter to the Lexington News-Gazette
Editor, on an objective approach to
the continuing problem and hazards
of drinking and driving among Wash-
ington and Lee University Students,
Joe Wilson, student editor of the Ring-
tum Phi gave a worthy, but not en-
tirely accurate, rebuttal to my article.

 

| wish to make a renewed attempt
to cover this vital subject; this time
in light of Mr. Wilson's rationaliza-
tions and counter arguments.

It might well be asked at this point:
what was the original motive behind
the writing of the article. | wrote it
with one purpose in mind—that of
preventing the needless loss of future
lives (be it students, townsmen, girls
here for dates, out-of-state travelers
or whatever other persons might be
victimized by accidents resulting from
students drinking and driving). Any-
time one life is lost as the result of
drinking and driving, the loss is tragic
beyond comprehension, Such a loss
cannot be rationalized or excused.

Avoided Statistics

In my article | purposely avoided
names and statistics to protect the
majority of students who are generally
and fully responsible in this personal
area of human behavior, Mr. Wil-
son's statistics dealt only with the
records of the Lexington Police De
partment as related to student driving
offenses: thus, they do not tell the
whole story. They do not tell of driv
ing offenses committed by drinking
students in Rockbridge, Botetourt,
Albemarle, Bedford and Campbell
Counties (adjoining area counties
through which students drive to and
from campus and off-campus socials

 

particularly those involving area girls
schools). They do not tell of acci
dents of students driving from Lex
ington to their homes at Various)
periods of time. And, Mr Wilson's
statistics do not tell of any number)
of “near accidents which were avoid

ed by one means of good fortune of

another in spite of drivers driving
under the influence of beverage alco

do the insurance companies get their
insights and criteria to determine this
leveling-off age figure? From past ex-
perience and regular consultation with
acknowledged psychologists.

University Responsibility

In his answer to my premise that}

the University has a responsibility to
help the students avoid the drinking
habits which could conceivably lead
to alcoholism, Mr, Wilson reached the
wrong conclusion, He is right when he
says there are no known “alcoholics”
(in the strict clinical meaning of the
term) among students at the Un-
versity, However, that is not what
this writer meant, Problem drinking
starts at the social level in the form
of so-called moderate drinking; and,
although you will seldom find a stu-
dent addicted to alcohol, in the ex-
treme sense, you can usually trace
most cases of alcoholism among col
lege graduates (later in their lives)
from the pre-college or college begin-
nines of moderate drinking which
eventually got out of hand.

This writer writes not so much as
an “Elizabethan,” as Mr. Wilson
infers, but as a 1967 realist; as a
former social chairman of the Epsilon
chapter of the Phi Kappa Tau fra-
ternity (national social) in Alliance,
Ohio: as one raised in a home where
both a grandfather and a father (God
rest their souls) were problem drink-
ers; as a former spasmotic drinker of
beverage alcohol; as one active if
Alcoholics Anonymous; as a chaplain
with the U. S. Navy in the Far East
for two years (where he buried several
fine young men who lost their lives in
accidents while under the influence of
alcohol); and, as the Lexington Rescue
Squad chaplain, where the occasional

“Third Time’s A Charm”

 

This the second of a two-part series
on past presidents of the University.
—Kditor,

The eighth president of the College
assumed leadership after the war.
The buildings had been sacked and
defaced by Union soldiers and the
library was despoiled. Only four pro-
fessors and forty students remained.
There had been no president since
Dr. Junkin resigned. The former
commander-in-chief of the Confed-
erate army, Robert Edward Lee, ac-
cepted appointment in August, 1865.
From the chaos of 1865 to his death
on October 20, 1870, a great univer-
sity had arisen.

fo honor his memory in 1871, the
name of the school was changed for
the last time: it was now Washington
and Lee University.

Son Succeeds Father

The head of the West Point Class
of 1854 and the son of the preceding
president became president for the
next quarter century. George Wash-
ington Custis Lee during the war was
aide-de-camp to President Jefferson
Davis. He was captured by the Union
at Sailor's Creek after he had engi-
neered the construction for the de-

 

Dr. William L. Wilson

fensive works around Richmond. In
1865 be became a professor of engi-
neering at Virginia Military Institute
and upon the death of his father be-
came president of Washington and
Lee. His administration ended in 1897
after a very hard struggle during the
stifling Reconstruction.

president in 1897, Willham L. Wilson
was born in Jefferson County, Va. and

Former Presidents Distinguished
In Several Different Endeavors

He enlisted in the Confederate Army |
and after the war taught at Colum- |
bia University. With the overthrow
of the test oath he became a lawyer
and a prominent figure in West Vir-
ginia Democratic politics. He became
president of West Virginia University
and resigned in 1882 to serve in the
U.S. House of Representatives. He
was chairman of the powerful Ways
and Means committee and engineered
the first progressive tariff bill. He
refused the presidency of the Univer-
sity of Missouri, became a regent of
the Smithsonian Institution, and in
1895 became Postmaster-General in
the Cleveland Administration. In 1892
he was president of the Democratic
National Convention. Upon the ex-
piration of his service in the Cabinet
he became the president of Washing-|
ton and Lee, serving until his death |
on October 17, 1900,

The youngest president of Washing- |
ton and Lee was George H. Denny |
who was only 30. Denny was born |
in Hanover County, Va., the son of!
a Presbyterian minister. He was grad-
uated from Hampden-Sydney and!
taught at several schools before re-
turning as a professor of Latin in!
1896. In 1899 he came to Washing-
ton and Lee to teach Latin and in)
1901 became president for a decade. |

Prominent Politician

There was extraordinary growth
as the student body increased from
200 to 630. He took an active part
in development of the Southern Asso-
ciation of Colleges and Prepartaory
Schools, of which he served as pres-
ident in 1905. This was accompanied
by the construction of many buildings
on campus. In 1912 he left for the

 

 

 

presidency of the University of Ala-
bama. He President and
Chancellor of the University until
his death in 1955. In 1946 he was)
acclaimed the “First Citizen” of Ala-!
bama.

Noted Scientist and Innovator

The noted scientist who took the
first x-ray photograph in the United
States became the next president of
the University. Henry Louis Smith
from Greensboro, N.C,, the son of
a Presbyterian minister, led from his
election to his retirement in 1929. He!
had been graduated from Davidson’
College and received his Ph.D. from
the University of Virginia. He be-!
came president of Davidson in 1901,
but left for Washington and Lee in
1912.

Shortened World War

Just as one Washington and Lee
president prolonged a war due to his
tactical knowledge, another shortened
a war with a new propaganda tactic.
The American War Between the States
and World War | were greatly in-
fluenced by two of our presidents.

Dr. Henry L. Smith

 

President Woodrow Wilson praised |
Dr. Smith for shortening World War |
One by several months. His idea for |
sending propaganda to Germany was |
so successful in undermining morale |
that riots broke out among the troops |
and the Kasier was forced to Mee}
the Reich. The pamphlets were put |
in self-deflating rubber balloons |
which could be dropped anywhere in|

| Germany. With the use of a gradu-

i
ated glass tube the gas escaped from |

the balloon as adjusted.

Francis Pendleton Gaines was born |
in Due West, S. ¢ and taught at!
Furman University, U. Va., and Wake
Forest College. In 1927 he became |
president of Wake Forest but left in|
1930 upon his election to the pres-|
idency of Washington and Lee. He!
led the University through the rough |
years of Depresison and war, and he}
up its academic reputation so|
that in 1956 a survey of educators |
chose Washington and Lee as one of |
the ten most distinguished men’s col-|
leges in the US.

Dr. Gaines retired in 1959 and be-|
came chancellor of the University un
tl his death in 1963

Letters to the Editor

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

An article appeared in last Friday's
issue Which was very misleading and
it would have been better if it had
never been reprinted. This was the
story about the student at Baylor who
died due to initiation hazing :

This article could have been taken
two ways that are relevant to Wash-
ington and Lee. Most people probably
read into it a subtle reference to the
“evil” fraternity system at WAL. But
it is equally possible to see that fra-
ternities are not the only organizations
which conduct hazing practices.

This was & “prestigious campus
organization” and the moral was that
even if fraternities don't exist, the haz-

| ING continues

Both lines of thought lead to the
moral that extreme hazing is danger-
ous, and everyone would agree with
this. But most readers at WAL would
come by the first line and see a
malicious cut at fraternities

This space could have been better
used with a story of local news which
couldn't be taken as slander. For
example, Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity
last Week conducted a very interest
ing symposium on relations between
WAL and VMI. Gen. Shell and act-
ing President Pusey were participants
as were other members of the facul-

ties
This outstanding example of local
public service did not appear any

where in the paper, but there was the
story about a hazing death at a uni-
versity two thousand miles away. The
anti-fraternity implications are obvi-
ous

| look forward to seeing more cov

erage of fraternity activities. Many
people outside the University have
acess Only to this paper for Wal

news and they should know the whole
truth

Respes ifully submitted,
Benny Grigsby

ment of the Tiger’s left tackle and
guard. With Green converting to make
the score 10-0, everyone in the stands
made whoopee. Clearly, someone(s)
had now decided to play for keeps.

Happily, things continued to get
much worse for the Tigers as they
fumbled the ensuing kick-off and WAL
recovered on the 19 yard line. How-
ever, in spite of an understandably
disgusted H-SC defense, W&L, thanks
to a questionable series of calls and
a very poorly placed football, proved
unable to gain either a touchdown or
a field goal. And so the first half
ended with the Generals in the lead,
10-0,

Interceptions Galore
Aid Generals’ Defense

W&L was off-side on this pass theft),
Lawrence and finally Freret for his
third interception of the afternoon
left Coach Stokeley Fulton and his
squad scoreless, For the harder H-SC
pressed, the tougher our defensive line
under McJunkin and Wolf got. In
fact, the visiting eleven couldn't even
tally in the fourth quarter when, with
the benefit of two fifteen yard penal-
ties, their offense was rudely dis-
mantled by a McJunkin-Freret con-
spiracy which made it clear that our
end zone was going to remain virgin
territory all day.

The second half was truly a bril-
liant effort by W&L’s defensive team.
And so it was appropriate that they
scored the final points of the game
when they dumped the Tiger quarter-
back for a safety as the clock ran

 

out for H-SC.

After being outplayed in the first
half, the varsity soccer team rebound-
ed in the third and fourth quarters to
defeat Davis and Elkins College, 4-0,
on Friday before a Parents’ Day
crowd. The visitors controled the play
in the first half, and only by means
of a stout defense did the Generals
manage to hold D&E scoreless.

In the third quarter the Generals
offense began to work smoothly, and
the result was a 3-0 lead at the end
of that period. Jack Horowitz was the
offensive star for W&L, as he scored
two goals and assisted on the other
two, which were tallied by Co-captain

The highlight of the game came in
the third quarter when Horowitz
scored his second goal. His goal was
unusual because he scored it bare-
foot. A Davis and Elkins player had
neatly deprived Horowitz of his shoe
at midfield, but the W&L lineman con-
tinued his dribble and put the ball
past the D&E goalie from twenty
yards out.

With Friday's victory, the Generals
now stand 3-2 on the season, This Fri-
day, the team will host a strong Roa-
noke squad at the start of Openings

Last Saturday, before a rate cCa-)
pacity crowd at Wilson Field, the har- |
riers stole places 1-8 from a con- |
siderably weaker Fairmont College.
Places, one, two, and three went to
Corbet Bryant, Harry Zeliff, and Bill

Generals allowed only 15 points to
Fairmont’s 50.

The opening meet of the season
was to be run with Richmond Sept.

in scheduling. The first meet was run!

in novelty and leaving development

Dr. Junkin also commented that
Pentsch’s paintings, though abstract in
form, were developed from realistic
themes, such as a field or a shore-line.
He develops his themes to the point
where they become abstract. The
original themes are still obvious to
the eye.

Dr. Junkin intends to change the
art shows exhibited in the gallery once
a month. He hopes thus to demon-
strate trends in modern art while still
allowing the majority of those in-
terested in the field the time to browse
and examine the works on display. He
is trying to attract a wide range of
student interest by a wide range of
art styles.

to help maintain quiet, and that this
project has been partially successful.
The Library Committee, Stack said,
would be more than glad to entertain
any suggestions from any student in
regard to the spending of the Chitwood
Fund or any other potential change
to make the library better.

Joe Matthews, a senior representa-
tive, outlined the problems involved
with subsidizing the Rugby Club, He
had talked with Dr. Hinton, chairman
of the University Athletic Committee,
about the possibility of that committee
funding the Rugby Club, but Dr.
Hinton replied that his committee did
not want the responsibility of the
Rugby Club,

Matthews said that the EC had
three potential avenues of action: It
could give the Rugby Club an out-
right grant this year on a one year
basis. The second alternative would be
to go through the Student Finance
Committee and obtain a portion of
the student activities fee. And the third
alternative would be to give them
nothing, and let them continue as
they have in the past.

Lexington Mumister Renews Drink-Driving Discussion

(Continued from page 2)

tragic results of drinking and driving
have been witnessed first hand.

Mr. Wilson's answers to five of
the six suggestions this writer made
to the University relative to this sub-
ject are far from accurate.

Manditory Lectures

Of my suggestion that the Univ-
ersity provide one manditory lecture
per semester on the hazards of stu-
dent drinking and driving, Mr. Wilson
states that the students “already under-
stand the seriousiness” of this prob-
lem. Even if this were fully true
that would be no justifiable reason for
an education institution to fail to
periodically re-emphasize the subject
to help keep the student alert to this
re-occuring problem.

Of my suggestion that the Uni-
versity provide more realistic super-

the Presidential Nomination” by Rob-
ert Potts, in which the increasing im-
portance of nominating conventions
is substantiated and discussed at
length.

Lewis H. LaRue, who teaches law
at W&L, is the only member of the
present faculty to have written an
Honors Thesis. Mr. LaRue wrote a
thesis in Political Science in 1959,

The number of Honors Students has
been increasing steadily since 1950.
In that year, two students submitted
theses, while 14 have registered for
Honors as of last week.

The merit of the various theses
could only be judged by those whose
knowledge of the subject is compar-
able to the students’. The Self-Study
report of last year makes it clear
that Honors Theses are of exceptional
quality: “The faculty appears to be
well staisfied with the present Honors
Program, and many Honors Theses
have been outstanding, in some in-
stances probably comparable to an
M.A. thesis.”

Honors Theses may be written in
the categories listed in the accompany-
ing box, as well as in economics,
Latin, mathematics, physics, religion,
modern humanities, and the inde-
pendent major.

 

vision over official social functions at
the fraternity level, Mr. Wilson
answers by saying that the house-
mothers and the students exercise
supervisory (behavioral) control over
all social functions at the fraternities.

This role of the housemothers is
exagerated by Mr. Wilson. However,
in fairness to the housemothers, pro-
priety calls for the avoiding of dis-
closure of the many problems and
limitations which many of the house-
mothers face at fraternity socials. Mr.
Wilson could be opening a “Pandora’s
box” if this point were carried to its
fullest conclusion.

Of my suggestion that the University
strengthen its existing regulations and
penalties rative to student drinking
and driving Mr. Wilson answers that
the drinking and driving regulations
(enforcement) comes under the re-
sponsibility of the local police and
“not in the realm of realistic Uni-
versity control.” There is only one
answer to this illogical statement;
namely: the preventing of needless loss
of human life comes under the realm
of responsibility of the University ad-
ministration and faculty, of the stu-
dents and the local law enforcement
agency. It must also be assumed that
the community at large shares in this
same responsibility.

Strengthen Regulations

In my suggestion that the students
be excluded from permission to
possess or own cars until their junior
year | was more conservative than
the writer of the editorial in the
Richmond paper (as quoted by the
News-Gazette) who suggested that the
senior year should be the “magic”
year. The College of William and
Mary goes even further by entirely
excluding the students from owning
or possessing automobiles.

Emotional Maturity

The real points, in this connection
are those centered around the emo-
tional maturity of the student in the
face of his age and the academic and
social pressures of life at the Uni-
versity. When you combine the “re-
leases” of drinking and driving the
student finds himself in a position of
grave danger to others and to him-
self.

Also, it is a well-known fact that
the average student (even those not
under scholarship or other aid) does
not come near to paying the actual

cost (to the University) of his educa-

 

 

tion. It becomes quite illogical that
a student should be able to “afford”
an automobile when he is not paying
the full cost of his education.

The fact, as Mr. Wilson states it,
that the girls “prefer and insist upon
riding in cars” does not preclude the
necessity that the University student
provide said cars, Such “insistence” at
such an early age in a girl’s life should
be fair warning to the male student
of even more formidible “insistences”
he can expect in the future, particul-
arly after marriage.

Intangible Statement

In my suggestion that the admini-
stration and faculty, at staff meetings,
should regularly deal with this subject,
particularly in times when the inci-
dents of student accidents are on the
rise, Mr. Wilson answers by saying
that when there is an increase in
accidents “someone at the school will
investigate.” That is a broad, in-
tangible statement. It is illogical to
avoid this subject as a “preventative”
approach and limit it only to times
following tragedies related to the
drinking-driving problem among stu-
dents. As University educators and ad-
ministrators are alert to the retarding
of their students’ academic well-being;
just so must they be alert to any
serious loss in student behavior well
being.

Any good law school knows that
American civil law is predicated on
moral law (which evolved from the

 

Mosaic law and American Constitu
tional law) and that changes in social
structures periodically call for new
or revised civil laws to cover chang-
ing problems or patterns of human
behavior. The same principles apply
to this specific subject under consid-
eration.

Irregardless of the conclusions
reached by Mr. Wilson, the student
body, the administration and faculty
of the University, | am grateful for
the fact that dialogue has been achiev-
ed by one’s humble efforts to deal
with this vital subject. If the Uni-
versity and the students become so
alerted to the need for action, and
thereby sustain periodic relevant act-
ion, and if just one life is spared as
a result, this effort will not have been
in vain. | personally thank Mr. Wilson
for honoring the subject by his article
and editorial.

Florida Governor Claude Kirk To Keynote
Republican Mock Convention In May

Florida’s colorful Gov. Claude Kirk
Jr. will deliver the keynote speech
at W&L’s 1968 Mock Republican
National Convention next May 3.

Mock Convention Chairman Steve
Saunders announced that a tentative
schedule for the two-day event in-
cludes a luncheon in Gov. Kirk’s
honor, followed by the traditional
Convention parade from 1-2 p.m. The
parade will include floats represent-
ing each delegation, which Gov. Kirk
will review.

The governor will then deliver his
speech at the opening session of the
Convention, to be held in Doremus
Gymnasium.

His selection retains the tradition
of having nationally prominent lead-
ers kick off the Convention. Past key-
noters have included former president
Harry S. Truman, Dr. Walter Judd
(who keynoted the real GOP Con-
vention in 1960), and former vice-

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

Friday, October 27, 1967

Not Slander

In our last issue we published an article entitled “Sopho-
more At Baylor University Dies Due To Initiation Hazing,”
containing the account of the death of a nineteen-year-old stu-
dent there following an initiation ceremony in which he was
compelled to do rigorous calisthenics after swallowing a con-
coction of laxatives and garlic.

In this week’s Tuesday Edition a letter appeared which
suggested that the article was “very misleading” and that “it
would have been better if it had never been reprinted.”

“This article could have been taken two ways that are
relevant to Washington and Lee (the letter continued). Most
people read into it a subtle reference to the “evil” fra-
ternity system at W&L. But it is equally possible to see that
fraternities are not the only organizations which conduct
hazing practices.

“This was a ‘prestigious campus ogganization’ and the
moral was that even if fraternities don’t exist, the hazing
continues. Both lines of thought lead to the moral that
extreme hazing is dangerous, and everyone would agree with
this. But most readers at W&L would come by the first line
and see a malicious cut at fraternities.”

* * =

As the writer of the letter observed, we printed the article
because we felt it was relevant to certain conditions existing
on the Washington and Lee campus. The article was not, how-
ever, a reference to the “evil” fraternity system. It was very
definitely a reference to hazing. And to argue that “fraternities
are not the only organizations which conduct hazing practices,”
and that “even if fraternities don’t exist, the hazing continues,”
is to miss the point altogether.

The fact has been and remains that brutal hazing has been
widely conducted on this campus as recently as eight months
ago. It has been conducted by organizations which claim pub-
licly that they do not conduct hazing. It has been conducted
in spite of the fact that the constitution of the council to which
those organizations all belong clearly forbids unnecessarily
harsh hazing practices. “Extreme hazing is dangerous,” says
the letter, ‘and everyone would agree with this.” But at
W&L everyone does not agree with this. And they subject
freshmen to mental humiliations and physical ordeals which
in many cases equal those which led to the death at Baylor.
The question of whether it is a fraternity or a “prestigious
campus organization” which permits the hazing is utterly un-
important; the question of whether hazing would exist without
fraternities is equally so; what is important is that extreme
hazing does exist, and that it exists at W&L.

Convention Keynote Speaker Claude Roy Kirk

 

By PATRICK AREY
Senior Staff Writer
Gov. Claude Roy Kirk, Jr., of
Florida will be the keynote speaker
of the 1968 Mock Republican Con-

vention next May 3.
The first Republican governor of
Florida since 1877, Kirk defeated

Miami Mayor Robert King High last
November in a_ conservative-liberal
party struggle for the governorship.
As governor, Kirk has been heavily
criticized for his employment of a
private security agency to fight crime
in the state and his third marriage
shortly following his inauguration.
As a
Democratic state,
strumental in’ revitalizing
GOP in a very real sense.
Following his election, Kirk in-
stalled a new, effective state Republi-
can chairman and initiated a success-

Republican governor in
Kirk has been
the

a
in-
state

ful fund-raising campaign. In state
legislature elections the following
spring, the GOP scored significant
gains.

Said Time magazine of Kirk, “He
succeeded at least in providing the
closest thing to a two-party state that
the South has today.”

Florida had supported Republican
presidential candidates in 1952, 1956,
and 1960, but failed to endorse the
Goldwater candidacy by 42,600 votes
in 1964. In that election, Kirk polled
only about 36 per cent of the vote
in his campaign against incumbant
Democratic Senator Spessard Holland,

In 1966, the upset of incumbent
Gov, Hayden Burns by Robert King
High in the Democratic primary, and
Hayden's subsequent refusal to en-
dorse High, set the stage for a Re-
publican victory in November,

Kirk’s campaign message
conservative leanings.

showed

He promised to clean up crime in
the state, to increase stale revenues
by luring in new business through
tax incentives, and said there would
be no rise in taxes. The no-tax-raise
promise was of obvious appeal to the
many retired, fixed-income residents
of the state.

Kirk’s campaign was reportedly
tainted with a sophisticated racist ap-

 

 

eae

“This space could have been better used with a story of
local news which couldn’t be taken as slander,” continued |
the letter, noting that Lambda Chi Alpha had conducted a|
symposium last week in which both VMI's General Shell and
W&L’s Dean Pusey participated, and which was not reported
in the Ring-tum Phi. (We would have been glad to run an
article on this very worthwhile symposium; however, the
Lambda Chi’s made no attempt either before or after to tell
us anything about it.) “This outstanding example of local
public service did not appear anywhere in the paper,” it con-
tinued, “but there was the story about a hazing death at a uni-
versity two thousand miles away.”

That hazing death—we did not, incidentally, publish the
details of that death; they are particularly gruesome—did, in-
deed, occur two thousand miles away. The conditions and
attitudes which caused it exist here on this campus. That is not
“slander.”’ Those who really fear for the future of fraternities
would do well to consider what would happen to them if just
one death or serious injury occurred on this campus.

We are not anti-fraternity. We are very much pro-fra-
ternity. We believe that the present fraternity system is ex-
tremely valuable to the education of the students of this uni-
versity. We deplore the kind of uninformed and fanatical
attacks which have been made upon fraternities in the past year
or so. But we also deplore the hypocrisy and brutalism which
lie behind the hazing which occurs on this campus, and we
will continue to publish articles which illustrate the effects
and elsewhere. And that is

Kirk Breaks Florida

CLAUDE R. KIRK JR,
Governor of Florida

of Maryland Democratic gubernator-
ial candidate George Mahoney (who
incidentally lost), “Your home is your
castle,” on the open housing question.

In his inauguration address, Kirk
declared his war on crime, to be di-
rected by himself, and demanded a
special session of the Florida legis-
lature within seven days to rewrite
the state constitution.

Commented one legislator, “It took
Jehovah almost seven days to make
the universe, much less prepare for
it.”

That same evening, Kirk, a divorcee
appeared at his inaugural ball with
a dark-tanned blonde at his side,
whom he introduced as Madame X.

Following the ball, Kirk went on a
five-day yacht cruise with her, and
announced their engagement on his
return. The girl was German-born
divorcee Erika Mattfeld.

In his war on crime,
the Wackenhut Corp., the nation’s
third largest security agency. This
action brought many protests of police
power. State legislators and political
appointees complained of bugged
telephones and being followed by
security agents.

Street Journal as the “governor a go

Florida, according to the Saturday
Evening Post, hosts the single greatest
community of mobsters in the U.S.,
some 45 “celebrities” in all. This fact,
says the Post, was acccompanied by
massive corruption within the state.

Florida, lacking a statewide police
agency, is virtually powerless to meet
this problem. The Wackenhut Corp.
is directly responsible to the governor,

The Wackenhut Corp. was origi-
nally hired at the token fee of one
dollar per year, the rest of the costs
to be financed by private contribu-
tions. But contributions have not ma-
terialized, and the program has had
to ask for state assistance.

What is the value of the program?
Some say it has been used to harass
or force resignation of state employes,
but a final judgement on its effective-
ness in fighting Florida crime remains
to be seen,

During the winter, the Florida state
legislature was reapportioned. Elec-
tions in the following spring greatly
boosted Republican representation in
the state assemblies.

Although the Democrats control
both houses, the Republicans gained
enough seats to deny the Democrats
two-thirds of the vote in each house,
which is needed to override guberna-
torial veto.

Republican state senate seats in-
creased from II to 20, opposing the
Democrats’ 28. In the state house,
Republicans gained 13 seats for a total
of 39, as opposed to 91 Democratic
seats,

As to the call for state constitu-
tional revision, this effort seems to
have quietly died.

Kirk has been criticized for his
flamboyance and flair for publicity.
He flies around Florida in a Lear
jet, and his self appraisals are un-
embarrassed.

“You know,” Kirk said once,
“Bobby Kennedy, Fidel Castro, and
I are all about the same age. The
three of us, now, represent the three
alternatives of the world in the future.
And you know what? I’m the only
one of us who's for free enterprise.”

Immediately following his election,

 

speculation arose as to his possible

System

candidacy for the vice presidency.
Kirk has made no efforts to deny
the allegation.

“I’m going to be the counterpoint
to the Kennedys, the Humphreys, the
Johnsons,” he has said. “I’ve got to
live in this country of ours for the
next 40 years, and I don’t plan to
let them run it.”

More realistically, Kirk has been
assessed as the one Republican who
could offset the effects of a George

Wallace candidacy in the South in
the 1968 elections.
Born in San Bernardino, Calif.,

Kirk served in both the Second World
War and the Korean conflict. He at-
tended the University of Alabama to
study law following World War II.

Following the Korean War, Kirk
helped to form a highly successful
insurance company. He later sold out
of the insurance business and entered
investment banking.

Whatever can be said against Gov.
Kirk, it can’t be denied that he does
have a flair for publicity and a per-
sonal style of politics.

One such incident occurred this
past summer at a Jacksonville Black
Power rally.

H. Rap Brown, chairman of the
Student Non-violent Coordinating
Committee, was preparing to address
about 200 Negroes in a baseball park.

Brown suddenly found himself con-
fronted by the governor at home base.
The conversation was reported as this:

Kirk: “Welcome to Florida.”

Brown stared blankly at the gov-
ernor.

Kirk: (offering his hand) “You are
welcome here if you came here in
good faith and in spirit. We don't
want any talk about guns.”

Brown: (ignoring Kirk) “Let me
have the microphone. I didn’t ask you
to come here.”

Kirk: “Mr. Brown, we welcome
you to Florida. If you are here in

good spirits, I'm glad you are here.
Are you here in good spirits?”

Brown: “I'l] speak without the mike
then.”

Crowd: “We want Rap. We want
Rap.”

Brown: “If we can't hold the rally
here, we'll hold it somewhere else,

someone as appealing as Sidney Poit-
ier, We know what the South is like
and we also know all about Poitier.
Combine these two facile prejudices
and you have a movie that will entail
their development along predetermined
lines with a minimum of effort on the
part of the audience.

It may be that American audiences
do not want to feel or understand any-
thing that requires any effort on their
part. If this is true then there will
always be a market for movies like
“In The Heat Of The Night” in which
all the feeling and understanding is
done for us, There is nothing more
for us to do than to compare the
miscreants which the movie tells us
are the inhabitants of a small town in
Mississippi with cool, intelligent, well-
dressed Sidney Poitier to tell us with
whom our interests and good wishes
lie.

To call the movie “commercial”
and to talk about lack of taste and
intelligence is, | think, to miss the
mark, The attitude of the filmmakers
toward the all but fatally spoiled
that of the fatally misguided parent
towar dthe all but fatally spoiled
child, No one connected with the film
believes for a minute that we, the
audience, can feel or comprehend in-
telligently; any attempt to use a reality
brings forth a type of cardboard ro-
mantisism and the annihilation of any
possible reality.

W&L Stamps
Go On Sale

DID YOU KNOW—that W&L was
the first private college in the coun-
try to be featured on a U. S. postage
stamp? Only six other institutions
of higher learning have ever been so
honored, Of those six, only the Army
and Naval Academies came before
WA&L. The others are Princeton,
Columbia, Penn State and Michigan
State.

This weekend the Lee Chapel Mu-
seum begins the sale of W&L Stamp
Collections. The collections will in-
clude the W&L commemorative stamp
and four other stamps associated with
Washington and Lee, all displayed
around the University Seal. Accord-
ing to Museum officials the Collect-
ions may be bought separately or
mounted in frames. Interested persons
may see and purchase the Collections
in the Lee Chapel Gift Shop or in
the University Supply store.

the All-Stars will make their pre-
miere performance at Washington and
Lee. Both concerts will begin at 8
p.m. with conventional dress being
required.

Pickett has become famous for
such songs as “Midnight Hour,” “Land
of a Thousand Dances,” and most re-
cently “Funky Broadway.” The Coast-
ers have gained their fame from
“Poison Ivy” and “Searchin’.” Ruffin
became well known this past winter
for “I've Passed This Way Before”
and “What Becomes of the Broken-
hearted” and Jr. Walker for “Shot-
gun” and “Road Runner.”

Tickets are on sale at the Uni-
versity Supply Store until this after-
noon, when solicitation of dance plans
for the whole year will cease. Guest
tickets can be purchased for eight
dollars per couple for each night at
the Co-op Friday and will not be
sold at the door,

Nevertheless, the Rugby Club needs
money, It wants team uniforms (the

the EC for financial help. Joe Mat-

that in this matter, the EC “has three

defense will use a lot of different
alignments to counter the various sets
of the W&L backfield.

In preparation for this week’s game,
there has been a notable absense of
the usual pre-Openings tomfoolery at
the Wilson Field practice area. The
Generals are gunning to extend their
record to 4-2 before entering the
crucial season-closing conference
games.

Last week's victory over the Tigers
from Farmville left Washington and
Lee perched atop the standings of the
mythical Virginia Small-College Con-
ference. A victory over Bridgewater's
Eagles would give the Generals a per-
fect 3-0 slate with no Old Dominion
small colleges left to play. With the
state title (not to mention the redemp-
tion of the lately tarnished W&L
football repuation) on the line Satur-
day, both the offense and defensive
squads have prepared diligently. In
addition, the J-V squad has been
working for their first appearance as
a unit against Augusta Military Aca-
demy.

ergo, I asked no questions in the
meetings, but feel that I learned a
great deal.

I think it is unfortunate that Mr.
Feld wrote this column without look-
ing into both sides, if he did not, and
it is rather apparent to me that he
did not. It strikes me as being in poor
taste, if not poor journalism. It is the
only act or statement approaching
rancor that I perceived during those
several thoroughly enjoyable and in-
formative days in Lexington.

Sincerely,
J. H. MeMillan '42

(Columnist Feld answers, “The
column was intended as just that, a
column, and not a new analysis deal-
ing with all ‘sides’ of the questions
discussed. The purpose was to under-
line what the writer [and a number of
others who attended the conference]
felt was a major deficiency on the
part of the alumni—a lack of in-
terest in the academic and intellectual
aspects of W&L in favor of ‘such
mundane topics as Fraternities and
Conventional Dress.’

“The alumni need not have asked
‘redundant questions for rhetorical
effect’ or ‘challenged’ the faculty.
However, there are areas of the aca-
demic program [which is after all the
most important aspect of the univer-
sity} in which W&L could stand im-
provement and with which the alumni
would do well to be concerned.

“It is regrettable that the letter-
writer found ‘rancor’ in the article
and ignored its more postive aspects. =

 

sort of arrangement could be worked
out by which the EC agreed to match
whatever the Rugby Club is able to
raise on its own, with the idea that
the club would eventually be able to
pay its own way and eliminate the
grant.

The students of W&L should not
allow the Rugby Club to run the risk
of folding. if only because the club
represents the essence of athletics at
this University. When a bunch of | -
boys go oul on their own, work up
a sweat, fight to win, and enjoy the
companionship of their opponents over
a beer after the game, isn't that
what athletics is really all about?

A few bouquets are certainly due
many of the team members for their
fine showings in the games to date.
However, defensive safety Charlie
Freret certainly deserves a little extra
praise. Last season W&L’s defensive
perimeter stole twelve passes all year
long. To date, Choo Choo Charlie has
personally pilfered six, which any
math major can see is half of last
years’ total. Against H-SC Charlie
picked off three, one of which was
unbelievable at least. When the Eagles
send their receivers downfield, there
will be Charlie, looking somewhat
like a refugee from a high school

Hallowe’en (Tuesday, October 31, 1967)

On Final Examinations

The faculty’s Committee on Courses and Degrees, which
is studying various possible revisions in the University’s sched-
ule of final examinations, is expected to make a report to the
faculty assembled Monday. Judging from the committee’s
record in the recent past—-notably, its approval of a subcom-
mittee’s recommendation that W&L adopt a form of the
Oxford plan of independent study; its initiative in establishing
a pass-fail program— it appears that there is more than a fair
chance for a final-exam revision of some significance to be
presented for approval. Certainly nothing less is the hope of
every student who has even looked at the existing inflexible
one-on-top-of-another schedule and seen potential (at best)
disaster. And certainly this is a reasonable hope in a school
where this semester the exam schedule is such that a student
taking Math 1, English 151 and Inorganic Chemistry would
have exams in those courses jammed into one 48-hour period.

One revision plan, submitted Oct. 10 to the committee
by the student body Executive Committee, asks that students
be allowed to sign up to take their exams whenever the exams
are given during the exam period. That is, if a particular course
is given at, say, B and G hours, students would be allowed to
take the final with the B-hour section or with the G-hour,
regardless of semester-long class “assignment.” This would
solve a few problems for a few people, and everybody would
appreciate it because it lessens everybody’s chances of meet-
ing a Waterloo—so long as they take courses offered at two
different hours, but not at three hours because when there are
three or more sections of a course, it’s placed into an afternoon
block exam time period, and there is no provision for changing
these in the EC proposal. Our hypothetical student with math,
sophomore English and Inorganic would still have three exams
out of four consecutive exam periods.

In petitioning for this change, the EC implied this request
was only a preliminary, a stopgap proposal until provision
could be made to adopt a “completely” flexible exam schedule,
perimetered only by a “first day for taking exams” and a “‘last
day” —in between which students would have five “take-home”
exams or, if not that, then at least “take at your and the
professor’s mutual convenience” exams. Washington and Lee
is small and students accordingly are given the optimum amount
of attention by a set of excellent teachers; this is undeniable
and is more than anything else the reason we and probably
1,400 other students are here.

We don’t want to appear to be calling the plays before the
faculty even enters the field; we don’t feel any need at all to
express alarm at what we're afraid the faculty will do; but we
do want to indicate once again, if we may, the degree of im-
portance every student attaches to an exam schedule that
doesn’t destroy all or even very much of what he has worked
a semester to realize. Exams are not just the frosting on a
semester’s cake; they are the substance of it. A student here
has only eight exam periods—these largely determine the re-
sults on paper (and those are the results everybody cares most
about) of his four years and $15,000 expenditure; they indi-
cate the professors’ success in putting across what ought to be
put across (“Washington and Lee is primarily a teaching insti-
tuition” —the catalogue). In spite of the standard “It is not
the University’s obligation to provide cramming time for stu-
dents who have been lax for a semester,” it does seem that
providing “review time,” as one might more genteely call it,
is a good idea for everybody.

Curriculum Committees Underway

 

French Classic
Returns To Lyric
For New Praise

To the delight of all who have a
modicum of artistic appreciation and
aesthetic sensitivity in their bones, Ed
Side has made Lexington a happier
place for escapism this week by re-
viving the French “Mary Poppins,”
the Grand Prix Winner at the XVII-
em Cannes Festival, “Les Parapluies
de Cherbourg.

Even those who can’t tolerate opera
for a moment find themselves caught
up in the typical French triangle,
Guy, Genevieve and Roland Cassard.
The music is superb, of course:
Michel Legrad is France’s Leonard
Bernstein, and “The Umbrellas of
Cherbourg” is Legrand’s “West Side
Story.” Even the American Academy,
which is known for taking care of its
own, nominated “Parapluies’”  re-
curring theme for an Academy Award.

Story Not New

The story itself is not new; there
are few older. Girl loves boy (Cath-
erine Deneuve is the girl—she’s the
one who excelled so in “Repulsion’);
he has to leave her (the French
draft, you know); after their last
night together she ends up in a family
way; he, once in the army, seems
(but isn’t) disinterested; she is pres-
sured by Mama into lovelessly marry-
ing a suitor who'll accept her in her
condition; father of her child comes
home; he marries on the rebound,
for want of something better to do.
The final scene, where the original
lovers meet through coincidence, is
one that rates with the love scene in
“Phaedra,” although by a very dif-
ferent standard.

The real strength of the movie lies
in its acting. Every character, even
those who appear for only a moment
in the background, is perfectly cast.
The two older women in the movie—
the girl's mother an dthe girl's lover's
aunt—have major roles that could
easily have intruded into the movie:
it is fortunate and surprising that they
don’t. The one “corny” scene, wherein
the girl and her husband (remember,
this isn’t her lover) are having dinner
in her mother’s home and suddenly
a Golden Crown appears and he
conducts a little coronation ceremony

with it, has possibilities for really
destroying a movie—but doesn't,
through some rather skillful role-

interpretation by actors who knew just
how far out the scene was.
Beautiful Photography
The photography is beautiful. The
French feel for color comes through
to save some sets which aren't exactly
elaborate. Camera work is simple and
effective. The whole thing comes
across—and what more can be said?
And finally, no mention of movies
this week could be complete without
comparing the offering of our two
friendly-rival theatre entrepreneurs.
In this regard, the entire student body
at Washington and Lee is deeply in-
debted to Ed Side for bringing this
particular movie at this particular time
to help counterbalance the abhorrable,
repelling “Luv” at the State.

Two girls watch the Washington and Lee Glee Club rehearse for its concert in front of the Iranian Exhibit.

Glee Club Entertains Audiences
In Washington And At Expo ’67

By MIKE ALLDERDICE

Strategically positioned at the
border between Iran and Switzerland,
the Washington and Lee Glee Club
did a fine job of entertaining its inter-
national audience. The W&L Glee
Club had the honor of being in-
vited to sing at Expo 67 on October
17, and the visitors of Expo had the
pleasure of listening to them.

The Glee Club, under the direction
of Professor Robert Stewart, had been
practicing diligently in preparation for
this trip since early September. The
rehearsals were more concentrated
and rigorous than ever before, but
the final result was well worth the
effort. By the date of departure, the
club was in top voice and keyed for
the coming performances.

Started October Ist

The trip itself started on Sunday
morning, October 15. The brass choir
and most of the freshmen in the Glee
Club boarded their bus for Wash-
ington early that morning. The rest
of the Glee Club left at eleven for the
Roanoke airport and were on a Pied-
mont flight by twelve.

 

Arriving at Washington, the group |
of students was greeted by Pete's trans- |
portation service in the form of a!
Rockbridge county school bus. The!
club was then chauffered to the Na-

tional Cathedral.

At the Cathedral, the Brass Choir
performed four pieces. They were fol
lowed by the Glee Club which sang
traditional religious works and three
spirituals as a prelude to the after-
noon service.

By five o'clock the Glee Club was
back on its flight to Monireal. After
stopping in Utica, New York, to re-
fuel, the club arrived at Montreal by
ten p.m. After clearing customs the}
club was driven to their motel, la
Parisienne. The first night was used
for purely un-official activities

Informal Concerts

On Monday the WAL Glee Club
gave two concerts at one of the most
modern and biggest shopping centers
in Montreal, the Alexis Nihon Plaza
It was strictly an informal concert;
the audience stood around the Club
or lounged on the surrounding bench
es. Although the situation was casual,
the concert was still professional
Everyone gave his maximum effort

At the time of the Club's tour,
all of Montreal was stymied by a

‘Mais C’est Tout’

We feel obliged to quell, on occa-
sion, rumors that we feel have no
place in the University community,
i.¢., rumors not started by this news-
paper. Accordingly, the Ring-tum Phi
is pleased to announce that none of
the University’s professors are going
to Washington this week to stand as
defendants in cases arising from the
recent anti-War protests; one or two
of them are going to a political-science
convention in New Orleans, mais c'est
tout.

 

one was driven to Expo at nine that
morning, and given free passes to the
fair. The concerts were given at eleven
and five in a bandshell located in
the midst of quite a few exotic pavil-
lins. Appropriately enough, they hap-
pened also to be next door to the
Brewer's Pavillion, which was in-
spected by a few connoisseurs among
the Glee Club.
Miserable Weather

Outside the bandshell, the weath®
had been getting worse all day. It
finally leveled off to a fine drizzle that

lasted until night. Because of the
weather, the crowds became dis-
couraged, making the lines to the

better pavillions shorter. Most of the
students took advantage of this by
taking in as many pavilions as pos-
sible.

The concerts were excellent and
the audiences responsive, which all
added to the pleasure of Professor
Stewart, who proclaimed the trip as
“the Club’s best.”

Washington and Lee captured the
Virginia Small College League foot-

Generals a 4-0-0 record aganist the
Eagles.

Cary Green remained the team’s

the points scored. Scoring for the
Generals started in the first quarter
with Green's 32 yard field goal after
the offensive unit failed to move the
ball,

quaterback Andy Bloom capped a 10-
play drive that began on the W&L

To the dismay of the Bridgewater

scoring threat came early in the
fourth quarter when quarterback Alan
Tibbs’ running and passing advanced
Bridgewater from its own 5 yard line
to the W&L 15.

The Generals’ VSCL record now
stands at 3-0 and its over all record

at 4-2. Bridgewater stands at 2-4 over

that the new set-up will be more
beneficial to future varsity teams and
will allow all the players, both fresh-
men and upperclassmen, to get more
playing time.

Great Expectations

Mr. Richard Szlasa, the J.V. coach,
believes his team’s greatest strength
lies in its offensive backfield. Passing
should be the order of the day with
quarterbacks Trip Smith and Buzzy
Sadloch throwing to Randy Reed.
Reed is a versatile player who was
converted from quarterback positions.
From time to time he may still see
duty as a quarterback. The running
attack shouldn't be lacking either with
Doug Gossman at fullback and Bruce
Green at wingback. Both are good
strong runners and excellent pass
blockers. The team’s supporters can
expect to see a wide open offense with
plenty of roll-outs.

The main problem may occur in
the defense. Junior varsity teams tradi-
tionally have a problem with depth
and W&L is no exception. The de-
fense may very well be strained al-
though it is bolstered by several out-
standing players. Peyton Vickers, Dee
Copenhaven, Frank Evans, and Ken
Carter should turn in fine perform-
ances. Copenhaver will see double
duty as an offensive guard and Carter
will probably be substituted freely in
the offensive backfield.

Roanoke Blanks
Soccer Team

By LAURENCE M. HILLIARD

Roanoke College came to Lexing-
ton on Friday, boasting that it pos-
sessed the top soccer team in Virginia,
and the Generals were unable to refute
this claim, bowing 3-0. The loss left
the Generals with a 4-3 mark. Roa-
noke is 7-1.

Before the game, Coach Joe Lyles
warned his team about Roanoke line-
man Scott Anderson and Jeff Archer,
but despite close defensing, Anderson
managed to slip through the Blue de-
fense for two goals, with Archer tally-

 

 

ing the other.

The Roanoke detense, seemingly |
with the belief that if General Left |
Inside Scott Fechnay could be held
scoreless, the whole team could be
stopped, had double coverage on|

ball. Coach Lyles continually altered

too many weaknesses to accompany

changes need to be made.
Offense Lags
After six games, the offense undet
varying quarterbacks has yet to gel.
The best offensive plays continue to
be the place-kicking of Green and
the punts and quick-kicks of Smith.
Until that offensive scoring drive in
the second quarter last Saturday,
which was directed by two “alternat-
ing” quarterbacks, it appeared that

W&L was going to remain as punch-|

less against the inspired, but neverthe
less inept defensive play of Bridge-
water as it had been against other
opponents.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Goals of Curriculum Committee

(Continued from page 2)

does not want such a report to be
vindictive or of such hasty construc-
tion as to lose any meaning.

Some Problems

It is as yet uncertain whether this
student publication would take the
form of an evaluation, an expanded
course description or both, The dis-
advantages of any attempt to judge
or rate are obvious, but a complete
disregard in this respect might result
in a rather innocuous document.

Steinger plans to ask the EC to
increase membership on the Student
Curriculum Committee to 10 or 11,
so that standing committees may be
appointed to study each idea that
may be of interest.

Faculty Committee

Planning along lines similar to the
Student Curriculum Committee is the
newly-formed Faculty Curriculum
Committee, appointed this fall by
Acting President Pusey. This com-
mittee elected Dr. Henry S. Roberts,
head of the biology department, as
its chairman,

Care apparently was taken by Dr.
Pusey to have the faculty committee
consist of members from various de-
partments within the University. Al-
though also still in a formative stage,
there seem to exist some specific ideas
for possible study.

Open Door Policy

Dr, Roberts made it clear that the
Faculty Curriculum Committee is by
no means a secret body. The sug-
gestion has been made that the two
committees combine or have joint
meetings, but this was mutually de-
cided against because of its unwieldy
size and certain inhibitions on both
sides.

Both Dr. Roberts and Steinger are
satisfied with the dual-committee ar-
rangement, and point out that com-
munications will begin on a regular
basis as soon as specific suggestions
are made. As Dr. Roberts said con-
cerning the exchange of ideas, “If the
students don't advance them, we're
going to solicit them.

Early Ideas

The Faculty Curriculum Committee
will most likely also examine the
Honors Program, looking at its weak-
nesses and strong points. And it may
be that the faculty committee will
wish to consider the charge that the
University is too departmentally struc-
tured; perhaps greater interdepart-

 

mental unity will result.

Department heads will likely be
consulted frequently in a serious look
at overall—not specific—distribution
requirements. A broad overlook ap-
proach will be taken by the com-
mittee, according to Dr. Roberts, with
considerations of the philosophy be-
hind the University curriculum.

A Shade of Difference

There is a basic and substantial
difference between the two commit-
tees. Obviously, the Student Cur-
riculum Committee will be prone to
concern itself more with short-range
goals of immediate benefit to Wash-
ington and Lee, Its turnover will be
yearly.

The Faculty Curriculum Commit-
tee will assume a longer-range, broad-
er and perhaps more thorough ap-
proach. Its interdepartmental mem-
bership, after having spent possibly
years considering major curriculum
chances, will certainly have the respect
necessary for a thoughtful faculty
vote on its recommendations.

Daylight Saving
Curtails Sleep

(Continued from page 2)

because nobody wants to buy coal at
all, it would undoubtedly organize a
huge lobby in Washington to repeal
DST altogether.

Some people, in fact, posit that DST
is a decided evil, that it alone is re-
sponsible for the riots in the cities
and everything else, because people
have more daylight hours to see the
squalor they live in.

So what we propose to do is to
make Daylight Saving Time a weekly
affair, Every Saturday night, every-
body should advance their clocks an
hour (if this becomes widely enough
accepted, the clockmakers of the
world could invent a new seven-day
clock that takes care of this auto-
matically); since they could sleep late
Sunday (they do anyhow), the hour
really wouldn't be missed.

Then, in the middle of the week,
say about Wednesday or Thursday,
everybody should move his clock back
an hour, and recover the hour when
he needs it most. Who would be-
grudge an extra hour abed toward the
end of the week, especially in a so-
ciety such as this where it’s been
statistically proven that 89 per cent
of the people orient their entire lives
to sleep?

Incidental Benefits

And think of the incidental bene-
fits. People in Appalachia who have
nothing to do from one season to the
next would regain their will to live,
looking forward to each Saturday's
and Wednesday's time changes. It
would be only a matter of time before
clock-changing bees became the ma-
jor social outlet in the Ozarks.

In fact, a random sample poll of
five representative types in Lexing-
ton showed that the only objection
to the Ring-tum Phi's DST plan
(which we call Darkness-Saving-Time)
is that somebody would have to think
up a new adage to replace the old
favorite, “Spring ahead, Fall behind.”

EC Discusses
Chitwood Fund

(Continued from page 1)
votes enpowered the Library Commit-
tee to spend the $280 of the Chit-
wood Memorial Fund on “best-sellers”
and delegated the authority to the
Library Committee to purchase the
books at their discretion.

The EC reached a consensus that
there was no pressing need to grant
the Rugby Club any money, and that
it would wait to see what the Rugby
Club’s need would be later in the
year.

Freshman representative Joe Tomp-
kins urged that there be greater fresh-
man representation on the EC’s stand-
ing committees. He moved that there
be two freshmen appointed to the
Student Library Committee. This mo-
tion was defeated by a 5-4 vote in
which president Richard Nash had
to cast a tie breaking vote. Voting
for the resolution was Joe Tompkins,
vice-president Gil Faulk, senior repre-
sentative Joe Matthews, and junior
representative Herb Crenshaw. Vot-
ing against the motion were Richard
Nash, secretary Jody Kline, junior
representative Lee Halford, and sopho-
more representatives Danny Leonard
and Steve Sandler. Butch West ab-
stained, Pete Hendricks was absent,
and Wick Vellines had left earlier.

Committee Selection

Lee Halford then moved that one
freshman be selected for both the
Cold Check Committee and the Li-
brary Committee. This passed 8-1 with
Joe Tompkins voting against the mo-
tion.

 

IFC Meeting

from the rule, since there are only
two weeks left before the mid-
semester—no pledge parties or other
activities are allowed.

Dean Atwood also expressed con-
cern over the increasing number of
small children and high-school boys
at fraternity parties. He said that some
of the children may be attracted by
the opportunity for theft as well as
the music. And high school students
were definitely out of place, accord-
ing to Dean Atwood.

Leading Actor Interviewed:
Discusses Role In New Play

By REED BYRUM

Laurence L. McConnell, a Sigma Chi from Atlanta, Georgia, pos-
sesses the unique distinction of being the first freshman ever to hold the
leading part in a Troubadour play. He is cast as Leon duPont, a man
vainly fighting society, in Boris Vian’s “The Empire Builders,” which is
representative of the threatre of the absurd,

The interview was very casual, taking place Thursday afternoon,
while Laurence was preparing for a special rehearsal because of the ab-
sence of a regular member of the cast. It began with iny asking him the
extent of his previous experiences in acting,

McConnell: My first formal participation was early in my high
school career in Oscar Wilde’s “In the Importance of Being
Ernest,” in which I played the role of a Dr. Chausable. He
was a type-cast character, being an elderly, well-meaning, yet
naive man, who had a minor part in the play. After this first
role, my interest grew rapidly, and I participated in three other
plays. Also, I helped to found a chapter of Thespians in my
high school, as the school theatrical group had no similar
honorary organization.

Byrum: Did you participate in any extracurricular acting or
speech contests while in secondary school?

McConnell: During the summer between my junior and senior
year, I went to a state-wide drama workshop and had roles in
two plays. As to forensics, I won the V.F.W. Voice of America
contest, which is designed to hear the adolescent views of Ameri-
can democracy, in the fifth district of Georgia, but lost to a
Columbus boy in the state finals.”

Byrum: Before entering Washington and Lee this past fall,
had you heard anything about the Troubs and their restrictive
physical plant?

McConnell; In April of 1965 I was visiting the campus and
came upon the theatre building, before its most recent re-
modeling. Mr. Lee Kahn, the director of the Troubs, greeted
me, and immediately we became involved in a conversation
concerning acting at W&L. I was not only impressed with
Mr. Kahn, but also with character of the plays which he was
anticipating to present.

Byrum: After learning that first you were awarded the lead
in the play and second that you were the first freshman to do
so, what was your reaction to receiving such honors?
McConnell: My initial response to being selected was one of
surprise and of almost bewilderment. However, I soon realized
that apparently others had faith in my abilities and knew that
I could handle the part.

Byrum: Laurence, you've told me much about your experience
in acting and your reaction to gaining the part, so now could
you tell me a little about your actual part in the play?

McConnell: I play the part of Leon duPont, the father of a
family, and he is extremely fearful of facing the adversity
and pain of society. Therefore, he retreats into the confines
of his home, the first act begining with his transferring of his
family to the attic of the house. He is fighting something
which he is unable to comprehend and thus effectively com-
bat. Leon takes his wrath upon a bandaged schmurtz, the
German word for pain, and constantly stabs and beats it. In
itself the striking of the schmurtz, representing Leon’s vain
efforts to combat society, brings in an almost entirely new
aspect to the play.

Byrum: How do you go about your part, are you caught up in
it or does it not motivate you?

McConnell: | personally like the role quite a bit, but I couldn't
say that I'm completely ‘caught up’ in it. I feel that an actor
loses his control over the part if he does this. He indeed must

schedule, the details of which were released to the Executive
Committee and to the Ring-tum Phi yesterday.

As the Tuesday Edition pointed out in its last issue, the
reforms are painfully needed and long overdue; the system
was last overhauled ten years ago to fit conditions which in many
cases no longer exist, while new conditions have arisen which
were not then foreseen. Obviously, the Committee on Courses
and Degrees has not been unaware of these facts, and it is
extremely pleasing to see that it has taken firm action to do
something about them.

The program, if passed, will not entirely fulfill the hopes
which the EC raised with its proposals on Oct. 10, which would
have given the student some freedom of choice as to when he
could take his examinations. Presumably, the committee came
to the conclusion that this would create too much chaos for
the professors faced with the job of grading under these condi-
tions, and this is probably a valid conclusion. On the other
hand, the committee did at least solve one of the major prob-
lems pointed out by the EC: the fact that all too many students
every year have to take three examinations within two days.
Any upperclassman can recall some particularly harrowing
example of what that means from his own experience. If the
new system goes through, this will all be ended for the vast
majority of students; the worst that could happen to most
would be a string of exams, one on each of five days.

We hope the plan passes Monday. It is a far, far better
thing than we have had before, and the Committee on Courses
and Degrees has our most sincere thanks for drawing it up.
We also hope, however, that the new plan will not be con-
sidered necessarily definitive, and that other plans providing for
freedom of choice and other reforms will not be disregarded
in the future.

“We are a defeated party with a

Smylie of Idaho, Chairman of the Re-

publican Governors Association in
1964, following the worst defeat a
major political party had sustained

in recent times.

The resuscitation of the Republican
Party within two years is no less than
a major political miracle.

Dance Board Not At Fault

Artists Cancel

and blame last minute cancella-
tions On poor management, agents call
at the last minute and make feeble
excuses why their clients will not
make it.

At an interview with Dance Board
President Paul Brower, and Faculty
| Advisors Drs. Delos D. Hughes and
Charles F. Phillips (see picture at
left), some most enlightening revela-
tions were uncovered.

Say

The Dance Board had signed con-
tracts, and had paid to the per-
formers one-half of the contract
prices, with Otis Redding, Wilson
Pickett, and Jr. Walker prior to the
sale of Dance Plans early in Sep-
tember. These contracts, among
other things, call for the perform-
ers to be at the gymnasium by 5
p.m. of the day of the scheduled
concert. The Dance Board did not
misrepresent the signing of these
performers to the student body;
Dr. Phillips has these signed con-
tracts in his possession,

On Friday, October 20th, the Dance
Board received a phone call from
its agent (Stan Rubin of the College
Entertainment Agency) in New York,
claiming that Otis Redding was in a
hospital suffering from a polyp and
that his doctor has ordered him to
rest for at least six weeks. Dr. Phil-
lips called the hospital and verified
the report. As a result, the Dance
Board found substitute entertainment;
a difficult task with only seven days’
notice.

A week later, on Friday, October
27th, the Dance Board received a
phone call from Rubin claiming that
Jr. Walker was cancelling his sched-
uled performance the next night be-
cause his organ player had lost his
passport in London and was unable
to fly back to the States with the
group. Jr. Walker said that he re-
fused to perform without the organ
player. Board President Brower offer-
ed to obtain an organ player, but
again Walker refused. This concella-
tion clearly violates the contract, and
the Dance Board is taking steps to
recover both the initial one-half con-
tract price, and an amount for dam-
ages. The Board will attempt to work
through the Musician's Union, which
can fine Walker and turn the money

Booters Crack VMI And EM In Midweek Wins

Team Sharp In 3-0 Victory

By SHELDON MILLER

On Thursday W&L’s soccer team
broke out of a slump and defeated
Eastern Mennonite 3-0 on the Gen-
eral’s home field. Eastern Mennonite,
sporting several foreign players, car-
ried a 4-2 record including an im-
pressive win over Lynchburg College
into this game. This game was especi-
ally important for W&L because it
assured the Generals of a place in
the state tournament.

Washington and Lee going into this
game had not been playing excellent
soccer and was in an unimpressive
slump. This game could turn the tide
in a season of sporadic play.

Excellent performances were turned
in by several members of the squad,
sophomore Kurt Jamison leading the
offense with a pair of goals. One goal
was a head in with an assist going
to Jack Horowitz, His second goal
was off a rebound,

The General’s other goal was ac-
counted for by Craig on a pass from
Tommy Fechtel, who played well

enough to earn himself a position as
a starter,

This game ties W&L with Eastern
Mennonite in state play with a 4-3
record,

Other good performances were
turned in by Charlie Harrold and
Richard Burroughs. The latter play-
ing a great defensive game. Jack
Horowitz and Scott Fechnay also
looked impresive.

The Generals next game is Tues-
day against the University of Vir-
ginia which will be played away.

Another exibition of teamwork, de-
sire, and hustle as exhibited yesterday
could give the Generals a good chance
of booting their way into the Vir-
ginia state soccer championship.

Generals vs. Tigers
Dates Back 75 Years

By LEE MecLAUGHLIN
Head Football Coach

Bridgewater proved a little tougher
than we had anticipated. However,
the win was con-
vincing, if not one-
sided.

Cary Green's
three - for - three
(three field goals in
three attempts) was
the most spectacu-
lar performance of
of the day. Bucky
Cunningham's _ six
receptions were al-
so helpful in the
victory. Our pass
defense was effective, but this was
the first time this year that we did
not have an interception.

It is now “Tiger Week.” We have
been working especially hard to pre-
pare for the “Purple Tigers.” Our
Monday night one-hour meeting lasted
eighty minutes. In other words, we
are giving a little extra time and!
energy to get ready for Sewanee.

In the series that dates back to
1892, the Tigers are ahead by two
games, 9-7. They have scored 220
points, while we have tallied 213. We
hope to overcome the difference this
Saturday.

In the past ten years, the two teams
are 5-5, Only one of our victories
came on the Sewanee Mountain, We
think that we can lick the “Tiger”
in his lair Saturday, Wish us luck.

By ROY CARLTON

On Tuesday afternoon, Scott Fech-
nay and Jack Horowitz demolished
VMI’s inexeprienced soccer team. It
was not W&L’s best performance of
the season, but the play of these two
could not be ignored. Fechnay scored
all five of the General's goals in a
5-1 contest, while Horowitz was
credited with two assists.

VMI was clearly the inferior team,
Winless, their best game had been a
4-2 loss to William and Mary, a team
W&L had mauled 7-0. However, when
the Keydets marched off the field at
the half, the Big Blue found itself
deadlocked at one apiece. Making
up for their inexperience with hustl-
ing determined play, VMI matched
Fechnay’s first goal with a tally by
Meybin midway through the second
quarter. They continued to provide
serious Opposition through most of the
third period, as the Generals could
not seem to organize any real offense.

Fechnay had returned the lead to
W&L at 2:25 of the third period. Late
in the quarter, the VMI defense began
to cave in as W&L applied some pres-
sure on the Keydet goal. Lying on
the ground before the goal, Fechnay
kicked in an off-target shot by Horo-
witz to increase the lead to 3-1 at
18:40,

The Generals continued to harass
the opposition during the fourth
period as Fechnay kicked in feeds
from Horowitz and Jamison for his
4th and Sth goals. Were it not for the
fine play of Horowitz and Fechnay,

with Washington University of St.

But maintaining the top spot might
take some doing, especially when the
Generals must engage Sewanee dur-

Bryant one spot lower.

“Bryant has been running well this
fall,” says Miller, “and his familiarity
with this course might present Romano
a strong challenge for the individual
title. Bryant will have to be at his
best, though.”

Southwestern, Centre, and Sewanee
are cited by Miller as having outside
chances for the championship.

“Ashby’s absence definitely will hurt
the Lynx,” says Miller. “He finished
only seconds behind Romano last
year, and it figured to be a real tight
race this time, especially since he
won the mile run at the CAC spring
track tournament five months ago.

Centre, defeated by the Generals,
16-45, in a dual meet here earlier this
fall, has a young team, while this
will mark Sewanee’s first appearance

Dr. William J. Watt, assistant dean
of the college, explained Thursday
that the proposals were made in order
to bring the examination schedule back
into conformity with students’ real
course schedules—schedules which
under the present exam system often
meant a student could have three or
four exams in two days.

When the examination schedule was
last revised ten years ago, according

quirements have changed.” Advanced
placement for freshmen and a relaxa-
tion of other course requirements
have meant in recent years that the
schedule is no longer as fair as it
was originally intended to be. The
“One-a-Day” Plan is an effort to
change this.

Dean Watt said a number of fac-
ulty members had approached the
committee last spring with proposals

1964, and the threat of George Wal-
lace have erased all political reasons
for an appeal to racists, say Hess
and Broder.

“What 1964 showed, of course, is
that civil rights is not just another
issue for Republicans; in the party of
Lincoln, it is the moral issue, and
even a hint of appeasement of racists
will quickly provoke a crisis of con-
science which the Republican party,
with its tradition, cannot compromise.”

Party Here to Stay

But whatever the results of 1968,
and especially in the event of a repeti-
tion of 1948, the resuscitated Re-
publican party is here to stay. Many
of its new faces, Hess and Broder
point out, among the governors and
senators wil Inot run for election in
1968.

And beyond 1968, it is the youth
of the party who will chart its direc-
tion in the years to come, people like

Lindsay, Evans, Tower, Percy and
Baker.

well all year long.

The “blue” (offensive) line has had
a good year also. With only one
sophomore on the unit, the veteran
front line has done a fine job in com-
bating the duplicity of today’s stunt-
ing defenses. They are an experienced
crew and have improved every game.
The holes produced in the Bridgewater
game were often large enough through
which to drive the porverbial truck.

Statistics, | think, will more closely

| verify my point than that of my Tues-

day counterpart. The team cumulative
statistics (easily obtainable from Mr.
Mickey Philipps, Sports Information
Department, Washington Annex)
shows that the Generals indeed
closely approach their rivals in al-
most every offensive category. In the
passing department, the quarterback
corps of Andy Bloom, Chuck Kuhn,
and Jack Baizley has done an envi-
able job, completing for a .448 per-
centage and three touchdowns. If it's
an exciting, explosive offense the Tues-
day writers want, the passing game
seems to indicate just that.

If, however, the author of Tues-
day's column bases his claim on the
Bridgewater game (which may or may
not be the only game he has seen,
if he witnessed it at all) those figures
shoot his theory full of holes. Against
the Eagles, WAL rushed for 201 yards
and passed for 68 more, including a
touchdown. These statistics were in-
cluded on the same page as the
editorial, probably as filler material

The point of this article should be

clear. There is enough criticism of

activists and it is expected that it will
sweep the country.

The actual techniques consist of
walk-ins, talk-ins, and lounge-ins.
Demonstrators in the co-op pretended
to go about their business, talking and
drinking coffee while bewildered re-
cruiters looked on. Others protested
throughout the campus by strolling
leisurely to and from classes. Of
course all this was carried out with
a higher purpose in mind. Besides
protesting the presence of the re-
cruiters, the activists were demon-
strating one of our most sacred rights,
inherent in the very nature of the indi-
vidual—the right just not to give a
damn.

The effect of this upon the recruit-
ers was plainly visible. Marines hard-
ened by Vietnam and Berkeley melted
in the face of this passive indifference.
For the most part they were forced
to pass the time talking halfheartedly
with the few 97-pound weaklings who
straggled in with the hope of being
turned into a man while our new
breed of passive activists looked on
in glee.

Thus the concept of civil dis-
obedience has been perfected be-
yond the wildest dreams of Henry
David Thoreau and Mario Savio.
What will come next is anybody's
guess!

But while | was sitting in the co-
op one afternoon I did get a glimpse
of what may become the protest
movement of tomorrow: civil civility,
or just plain friendliness.

The protest began when a student
walked up to one of the marine re-
cruiters sitting in a corner of the
co-op with a defiant look on his face.

Student: Hi.

Marine: Hup.
Student: Nice
ing.

Marine: Are you trying to give me
a hard time?

Student: Why, of course not. Why
should 1?

Marine: Then why are you here
heckling me?

Student: Well, you looked like a
visitor to the campus, and I thought
I'd come talk to you.

Marine: Gee.

Student: Say, what's that snazzy uni-
form you're wearing?

Marine: I play in the high school
band.

Student: For « minute | thought
you might be a soldier or maybe even
a marine. | sure am glad you aren't
because they have to hurt people.

At that the marine hung his head
sadly and said, “Yes, | know.”

“Well, so long,” said the student.

“Yeah, so long,” answered the
marine as he slowly pulled out his ID
card...

Sen. Philip Hart
Plans To Speak
On Trust Policy

Ihe School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration and the School of Law
will present U. S. Senator Philip A.
Hart at 8 p.m., Wednesday, Novem-
ber 15, in Lee Chapel. Sen Hart will
speak on “Anti-Trust Laws.”

Sen. Hart was born in Bryn Mawr,
Pa., and received an A.B. from
Georgetown University and a J.D.
from the University of Michigan.

After graduation and admittance to
the Michigan Bar, Sen. Hart practiced
law in Detroit. In 1941 he joined the
army as a second lieutenant. As a
lieutenant colonel in the D-Day in-
vasion, he was wounded at Utah
Beach. In 1945 he received the Croix
de guerre.

After his discharge from the army,
he returned to practice law in De-
troit. He later served as U. S. attorney
for the Eastern District of Michigan
and as legal adviser to the governor
of Michigan.

From 1955 until his election to
the U. S. Senate in 1958, Hart was
the lieutenant-governor of Michigan.
As Michigan's first lieutenant-gover-
nor to serve in the office full time,
Hart capably outlined the state's pro-
gram for distributing the polio vac
cine.

Since his election to the Senate as
a Democrat, Hart has served on the
committees of agriculture, forestry,
and the judiciary. He is also chairman
of the Senate sub-committee on Anti-
Trust and Monopoly.

Senator Hart is a past Michigan
chairman of the American Christian
Palestine Committee. He has also
been president of the Michigan State
Bar Foundation, and currently, he is
a member of the Detroit Committee
on Foreign Relations.

In 1952 Hart received the award
of the Federal Business Association
as the Outstanding Federal Admini
strator for the year, in recognition of

Faculty Approves Exam Change;
Drug Use Subjected To Penalties

In actions yesterday afternoon, the
faculty made changes and clarifica-

automobile regulations, and student
drug use.

The Faculty approved the follow-
ing resolution that had been submitted
by the Student Affairs Committee con-
cerning drug use:

“Because of recent events oc-
curring on college campuses, the
Student Affairs Committee has given
special attention to the problem of
misuse of drugs by stndents.

“The Committee recognizes that
there are customary procedures at
Washington and Lee for the handl-
ing of matters involving student dis-
cipline on a case-by-case basis with
no schedule of penalties presribed
in advance. The Committee feels
that this established approach to
student discipline has proven effect-
ive and should be preserved. How-
ever, the Committee would like to
make known its view that the mis-
use of drugs by students would be
a serious disciplinary offense, and
that in all such cases the penalty

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

AT MID-TERM

This is only the seventh Tuesday Ring-tum Phi of the
year, and yet so much has taken place at Washington and Lee
that we'd like to recap some highlights of the two months so
far—in concentrated form, both for impact and because if
we waited much longer a reasonably comprehensive listing
would be burdensomely overlong—and because in the last
analysis, we’re rather fond and proud of this University.
® Most striking is the frequency and top-notch quality of the
diverse speakers who have visited here. Walter Heller and
Senator Hart, both brought under the Commerce School’s
new alumni-funded speaker series; Secretary of Transporta-
tion Boyd, who dropped in one Saturday; Sir Sidney Caine;
Drs. Fletcher, Kernodle, Williams and Lehman; Anthony
Howard of the London “Observer”—these all came to Wash-
ington and Lee because we are Washington and Lee, not
because we are stops on a lecture tour. The lecture-tour speakers
oughtn’t be neglected, either; this year’s speakers, including
Undersecretary of State Frankel and Drs. Freidel and Kazin,
are among the most noteworthy we've had on campus in a
long time. “Contact,” bringing Barry Goldwater and Thruston
Morton, with others yet to be announced, and the Mock Con-
vention, bringing Claude Kirk and others also yet to be
announced—these all give us a good start, to say the least.
® The new student union, conceived and begun-upon under
Dr. Cole’s administration, will undeniably do W&L a world of
good. The Troub Theatre renovations, the new and sorely
needed ROTC facility, the imminence of announcement of
a major development program—the University’s physical
well-being is being well looked after.
® Enough huzzahs can never be given the faculty for amend-
ing the exam schedule. A thousand other things deserve men-
tion, too: WLUR’s decision to broadcast football games (and
its superb execution of that decision); Mrs. Munger and the
Bookstore; the provocative, fruitful alumni visitation; the
Glee Club in Montreal; the new curriculum committees; the
new attitude toward hazing (certainly attributable only in part
to the new rules); for that matter, the marvelous interest
shown by everybody for everything that makes W&L what it
is, and in everything that ought to make it what it ought to be.

Most places would give their eye teeth to have that for
a year-long record. We have that, and more, in a half-term.
Add it to the faculty and student body we also have, and we
seem to come precious close to fulfilling, already this year,
the outline of W&L’s “basic purposes” in the Self-Study’s
“Statement of Institutional Philosophy”: “The dedication of
all our resources to the development of the capacity and de-
sire to learn, to understand and to pass on to others.” Amen.

irk Says Johnson Will Dump Humpbrey

(Florida Governor Claude Kirk, who will keynote
the 1968 Mock Republican Convention, was inter-
viewed over the telephone by Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
writer Larry Honig. Following is a transcript of that
interview.)
Copyright © 1967 by The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
7 + -
Ring-tum Phi: Mr. Governor, do you believe Senator
Smathers is going to retire next year?
Gov. Kirk: We've been given every assurance by the
Senator in his constant statements that he is going to
retire. | only had one misgiving, and that was when
he made the statement a few months ago that he felt
like his health might return to him in time to run for
the governorship in 1970. It sounds to me like if he's
going to feel that good in 1970, he might feel a little
bit better in 1968,

R-t Phi: Whom do you see from both parties as possible
contenders for the seat?

Kirk: The Democratic party has got its two so-far regist
ered contenders, Mr. Leroy Collins, former governor of
the State, and the present attorney-general of the State,
Mr. Faircloth. There is some continued rumor that the
chairman of the Board of Regents [Chester Ferguson],

who is not supposed to be a political dean, is the
maior candidate for Senator,
The Republican party has the very attractive

Congressman, [Edward J.| Gurney from Orange County,
which is Orlando, [who] will probably announce some
day soon that he will be a candidate and will then make
the race and will be elected the | nited States Senator
from Florida

R-t Phi: What prospects do you see for expansion of the
Republican party in the South?
Kirk: We're not concerned about the South. Were
Florida, which happens to be geographically located in
the South. I'm from Alabama, and quite frankly we like
to think that we're members of the United States. As the
Republican party expands in the nation, i also will be
expanding in the various slates which are also located
in the South

Somehow or other, | hear people say South” with

tongue-in-cheek like we're some retarded group
1 object to that ind I point oul thal Florida, of Qours
. the eighth state in the nation, and well in vivance of
ome of the other geographically located states that are

in other positions all the way down to number filty

R-+ Phi: Do you see any possiblity of the Republican
party recapturing the Negro bloc vote?
Kirk: | would hate to think there was such a thing a»
say kind of bloc vote. In Florida, we dont have while
people or Negroes—we have six million Floridians, And
| think we don't appeal to blocs down here. Now, may be
that’s the order of the day in Northern districts Mayor
Daley's area. where the President seems to think its 80
important that he has the Convention
Inasmuch as the Republican party wanted to be
n Miami, and so voted apparently the President
subscribes to your approach that there are such things
bloc votes. Therefore he put it in Chicago We dont
ubseribe to that in Florida, or in the Republican part)
We think Americans are Ameficans

-+ Phi: People have cautioned the Republican party

that if it nominates a candidate with a stronger position

on Vietnam than Johnson's, the Communists will take
action to ensure Johnson's re-election. In light of Khru-
shchev’s bragging about Nixon's defeat, what do you
think of this caution?

Kirk: I don’t know who these people are. | think that's
some wishful thinking on the part of some very ultra-
liberal writer . . . who can't think of anything else to
say or do. Unless you can establish the person, time and
place. I doubt if anybody that wants to vouch for his
name ever said that... . You know the easiest thing to
float and the hardest thing to sink is a rumor.

R-t Phi: Senator Tower of Texas and you are recognized

 

“Mir. Politics is not going to sit around... ~

po sible Vice-Presidential candidates from the South
Do you see any others’
Kirk: I'm not a Vice-Presmlential candidate from the
South. I'm damn tired of being identified as that jist
because [Tm a Southerner. We Southernet ive a little

 

 

upset with this continued segregation; were nol second
class citizens down here

And if vow think & man capable of being Vice
President—one breath from being President——then you
must think he’s capable of being President. We all know
that there is NO Way a nm can campaign for Vice- Presi
dent The President picks his Vice-Presidential
candidate. So | think that’s jet so much sepregation
hat we will le hem be gun bearers bul we wont ever

let them be hunters. Quite frankly, | don't subscribe to
that.

I'm not a candidate for either office, but if you're
going to talk about it, let's . . . be candidates on equality
with people from other areas. As an example, how many
people are in Michigan? There are 8'o million.
Why is the governor of Michigan any better than the
Senator from Texas? | have six million people here.

lo pick another extreme, Mr. Goldwater was Senator
from a State that has a million people. I don’t think the
size or location of states has . . . anything to do with it,
Now you must admit, of course, that the governor of
the State of New York or the governor of the State of
California—the number one state in the nation, by
number—is automatically catapaulted into . . . presi-
dential consideration.

You may remember all the time that Governor
Warren was governor, he was always mentioned. Pat
Brown was always mentioned for some position, Those
are realistic; that’s all right

R-t Phi: A supposed handicap of a Rockefeller-Kirk oF
Rockefeller-Reagan ticket is that all have been divorced
Do you feel this is or could become a handicap?
Kirk: | don't think that's any handicap. .. . We're talk
ing about electing a man on his ability to administer a
state or a nation, and not his ability to live with a
woman On that basis, you'd never elect a bachelor,
either My 18 years of marriage—I don't know about
the others—resulted in four lovely children. I'll stake
my four children against the President's two any day
you want to, on quality of person, or bearing, or beauty
you name it

So Till stake any one of my marriages against any
body else's, if that's the criterion, Quite frankly, | think
Americans are over that if all the Americans and
their families who've been touched by divorce were to
all get behind the divorced candidate,
ably have a sweeping victory for him

{Americans are] over the fact that you cant vote
for a Jew because he's a Jew, you cant vole for a

you'd prob

Catholic because he's a Catholic, you cant vote for a
Negro because he's a Negro, you cant vole for a
divorced man because he's divorced, They look at the
man as a man and not anything other than what job

hes supposed lo do

R-¢t Phi: When and why do you think the American pub
lic came over this?
Kirk: Because we're Americans. This is the most dynamic
country in the world, This is a country where theres a
consianit revolution: democracy is a constant revolution
We are the only country in the world that is in constant
revolution, trying to upgrade every person within our
boundaries

Obviously, by our record, we're trying to upgrade and
help up every willing person in the world, We've done

im Japan, we've done it in Germany, were trying to
do it in Vietnam, we've done it in Korea, were willing
to do it in Africa, we're trying our best to do it in South
America

R-t Phi: In your opinion, who is the front-runner for the
Republican Presidential nomination?

Kirk: | don't know who that would be now. There are
o many fine candidates that truly the Republican Con
ention will he the only democratic convention conducted

tis Vea!

R-t Phi: Whom do you favor, may we ask, for the Presi-
dential nomination?

Kirk: | just think any one of them is going to make a
great President. Fortunately, any one of the Republican
candidates . . . would make far and away a greater
President than the existing President of the United States.
So we can't help but win, if we go to work.

Now I think, as I've stated last week, that we have
an uphill fight, because Mr. Politics—which is President
Johnson—is not going to sit around and just not do
something after that very exciting Republican convention.
.. . He’s got to do something, and. . . he probably will
ask Mr. Humphrey to step aside and become Secretary
of State or Secretary of Defense, and will seemingly open
up the convention to some measure of excitement.

But actually | think what he will do is try to get the
doves back in the Democratic coop by naming a military
dove as Vice-Presidential candidate with him, which
would of course be General James Gavin. | made this
statement in Detroit, and I think a lot of people agree
with me

I mean, who's the past master of grabbing the head-
lines? Who's the boy that throws the long ball in the
eleventh hour? Who is the very suckling child of politics?
It's Mr. Politics, the President of the United States, You
can fault him in anything you want to fault him in,
but you can't fault him as Mr. Politics

 

Last summer the militant SNCC chairman H, Rap Brown
came to Jacksonville and ay he urged his audience to
“get yourself some gums,” Gov. Kirk overwhelmed him
with a cheerful “Welcome to Florida!” Brown was so
aghast and the audience so enthralled that the situation
quickly calmed down, Kirk left after an energetic round
of handshaking and Brown left muttering something
about rude Southern “honkles.”

R-+ Phi: Mr. Governor there anyihing el

Last Saturday, in a game which, back Bubba Owens and by Jim Beene

could have clinched the CAC title for
Washington and Lee, the University
of the South at Sewanee rolled over
the Generals 43-0.

The usually strong Blue defense was
unable to contain the overwhelming

(last year’s all CAC defensive back).

Scoring for the Purple Tigers started
early in the first quarter when back,
Charles Gignilliat ended a strong
rushing attack with a two yard scamp-
er into paydirt.

The second quarter was almost com-
pletely dominated by the Tiger offense.
fouchdowns were scored by King on
a 29 yard pass play, Owens on a 58
yard run, and finally by Blount on
a two yard run.

The Generals tried hard to over-
come their 28 point deficit in the
second half but failed to move the
ball consecutively. Sewanee added
another 6 points to their score but
Underwood failed to gain the extra
point.

Once again, in the fourth quarter,
the Generals could only muster a
mediocre offensive drive and allowed
Beene to sneak through on a one yard

run. In the closing minutes of the
game, Poff blocked a W&L punt and
a safety was scored.

Sewanee, with 334 yards rushing,
outgained the Generals 478 to 288 in
total offense. Probably the most out-
standing performance by the blue
team was Andy Bloom. Completing
19 out of 33 passes he totaled 244
yards.

The loss was the Generals’ third
this year against four victories. Sewa-
nee is also 4-3.

It is interesting to note that for
the last five years of Homecoming
games with Sewanee, W&L has lost
only before the Sewanee homecoming
crowd, and Sewanee has lost only be-
fore the Generals’ home crowd.

I-M Football

Nears Climax

By GEORGE McFARLAND

This week I-M football will move
to a climatic finish with playoffs be-
ginning next week. In league “A” it
seems to be all over. Phi Gam is the
surprise class of this league. The Phi
Kaps seem to have lost “the knack”
this year. If you do not believe Phi
Gam is all that great, just ask a
Siema Nu.

“B” league will witness a collison
of the behemoths Wednesday at 2
p.m. The Phi Delts will clash with
Lambda Chi for the league trophy,
which should be a lovely piece of
hardware.

“C” league has been busily seek-
ing to defeat the Phi Psi varsity team
to no avail. Kappa Sig will be seeking
to put a cramp in the Phi Psi bid for
glory, but it looks like a tough
assignment.

“D” league has to be the surprise
of the season with N.F.U. perched
on top of an embarrassed heap. They
played ZBT today. A ZBT win would
develop a three way tie between
N.F.U,, S.P.B. and Z.B.T.

Who knows the story on minor
sports? As long as the fraternities
sink all their atheletic funds in foot-
ball scholarships there will be little
University interest in the “lesser”
sports, Remember now, cut your labs
next week and hike over to the
practice field for the orgiastic climax
of 1-M football, It should be worth the
effort. Meanwhile, this reporter will

 

i be seeking information leading to a

Tuesday p.m.

By RIC BERARD

With all the recent excitement about
our football team and the great prom-
ise of other in-
tercollegiate sports
here on campus, it
has suddenly _ be-
come apparent to
me that all of us
have been ignor-
ing or else unaware
of the emergence
of a new giant
within the W&L
community. Natur-
ally, 1 am referring
to the FU intra-

BERARD

mural program.

For following a perusal of current
I-M standings, the old fraternity bones
in me had a convulsive start when I
spied the FU record of 9-8. With a
certain masochistic design, | pursued
this unfortunate turn of events to the
local I-M fields where I witnessed
another FU gridiron triumph over the
“beep-beep” fraternity.

No longer able to control my nose
for news, I shuffled up to a departing
victor and ever so casually queried
my man. As I recall, it went some-
thing like this:

“Well, ya'll really must have had
another lucky day, today, huh?”

“What do you mean ‘lucky,’ buddy?

Those bums were ‘lucky’ to escape
with their lives. We should have
scored twice as many points!”

“Gee, but I thought the ‘beep-
beeps’ had a good team this year?”

“Well, maybe. They did try hard.
And they were the best the fraterni-
ties have been able to throw against
us so far. But still, it was a slaughter.”

“But isn’t it true that this is the
first year that the FUs, oops—sorry—
I mean Independents, have been able
to win even one football game?”

“Yeah, but we're changing with the
school. You know, the better the
school gets, the stronger we will be-
come. It’s just great. Whether for
participation points or a winning
game, fellas are cutting labs, seminars
and ROTC just to be a part of this
change. Oh, by the way, you can
call us FUs. It’s a source of pride
now.”

“You realize that not many fra-
ternity men would agree with you?”

“That's okay. We know we're righi
and we have time on our side. Be-
sides, we've got more people to draw
on than any fraternity on campus.
Right now, all we have to do is
marshal all our forces and we can
be right at the top of this I-M heap
come next June, After all, we came
in ninth last year. And, in terms of
this season our best sports are just
coming up.”

“Hmmm. Surely, you must have
some weaknesses? | mean, you can't
destrory the fraternities’ leadership in
one year, can you?”

“You're right, we do have a weak-
ness: we can't get freshmen FUs to
participate. We have a real communi-
cation problem; there's no doubt about
it. But we're going to have some meet-
ing this week in order to get things
moving. Until now, we have had only
a couple of freshmen helping, but one
of them scored in the top ten in the
turkey trot. Still, you're right, we
do have that one weakness. Otherwise,
watch out!”

“Gee, a lot of fraternities need the
I-M rankings for rush week; it all
seems kind of vengeful and unfair,
Are you sure this is what you want
to do?”

Then, in a fit of laughter, my inter-
viewee grabbed a basketball and went
upstairs to the FU scrimmage.

Exactly what will become of this
new spirit, talent and participation by
the motley aggregate known as the
“PUs” is unclear, However, through
the efforts of last year's athletic di-
rector, Neil Jespersen, and the current
organizer, Ray Bradford, many tal-
ented non-fraternity men are now not
only having fun in I-M, but also win-
ning games, It really presents a de-

lightful problem of great magnitude |

for the motely establishment.

The College Athletic Conference
held its fourth annual cross country
meet on Saturday, and for the fourth
time, Washington University has run
away with first place honors.

Running over Washington and Lee’s
4.1 mile course, the Battling Bears
from St. Louis completely dominated
the race, taking first, second, third,
fifth, seventh, eighth, and ninth. Since
only the first five runners from each
team count in the scoring, W.U., had
a score of 18, only three more than
the possible minimum, The host Gen-
erals were second with 57, followed
by Southwestern, 91, Centre, 99, and
Sewanee, 113.

For the second year in a row, Dave
Romano of Washington was the indi-
vidual champion, covering the course
in a time of 23:45.3. He was followed
by teammates Ben Slavich, and Ron

power to charge interest to anyone
who was delinquent in paying them.

Kline, Vellines, Halford, Crenshaw,
Leonard, Tompkins, and Hendricks
voted for the change. Faulk, Mat-
thews, and Sandler voted against the
motion. Several of those who voted
against the motion apparently felt that
the additional work that the Cold
Check Committee would be required
to do would not be of any significant
value.

Crenshaw moved to have 3 addi-
tional upperclassmen appointed to the
Curriculum Committee at the request
of Lane Steinger. This motion passed
6-5 with Nash casting the tie-breaking
vote. For the motion were Nash,
Faulk, Matthews, Halford, Crenshaw,
and Leonard. Against the motion were
Kline, Vellines, Sandler, Tompkins,
and Hendicks. Butch West was absent.
Many of those that voted against the
motion felt that at least one of the
three should be from the freshman
class.

Lane Steinger outlined the initial

action of his committee. It has been
divided into two sub-committees. The
first sub-committee is to determine the
type and scope of the course review;
the second is to concern itself with
the changes in the curriculum.

The Curriculum Committee would
attempt to face the following questions
over the year, Steinger stated: the
status of the independent major, crea-
tion of more inter-departmental ma-
jors, the status and prerequisites of
seminars, a tutorial plan, general
theses and comprehensives, possible
changes in the graduation require-

lege system. The free college system
is where students will get together
and run a course or seminar for
themselves on their own.

Herb Crenshaw then reported on
his study on the problem of the
tests at mid-semester. The EC reach-
ed a consensus that they had a three
point program which they could act
on, First, letters should be sent to
all parents explaining the exact scope
and meaning of the mid-semester re-
ports. Second, scheduling of mid-
semester tests On a system similar to
that of the new final exam system.
This would prevent more than one
mid-term exam on any one day.
Third, the use of a pass or fail
criterion instead of an administrative
grade.

The EC postponed action on the
mid-semester proposals until all the
members had time to think over
Crenshaw's report,

Turner Writes On Railroad

Dr. Charles W. Turner, professor
of history, has written an article ap-
pearing in the current (October) num-
ber of “The Railway and Locomotive
Historical Society Bulletin,” published
by the Baker Library of Harvard Uni-
versity’s business school.

Dr. Turner’s article is entitled “The
‘Great Short Line’ In Reconstruction,
1865-1876," and concerns the Rich-
mond, Fredericksburg and Potomac
Railroad, which has “the distinction
of being one of the earliest to be
chartered and built in the United
States with capital subscribed by both
the state and private interests.”

New Circuit Court Judge
Schedules A Speech
For Law School

The Student Bar Association will
present United States Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals Judge John D.
Butzner, Jr. Tuesday, November 14,
at 8:00 p.m. in Tucker Hall.

Judge Butzner, a native of Scran-
ton, Pa., received his B.A. from the
University of Scranton and his LL.B.
from the University of Virginia.

Appointments

After he was admitted to the Vir-
ginia Bar in 1941, Butzner set up a
private legal practice in Fredericks-
burg. He remained in Fredericksburg
until 1958. From 1958 to 1962 he
served a judge in the 15th and 39th
Judicial Circuits of Virginia.

In 1962 Butzner was appointed to
the federal judiciary as U. S. Judge
in Richmond for the Eastern District
of Virginia. Butzner served in that
capacity until last August, when he
was appointed to the 4th Circuit
Court of Appeals in Richmond.

 

UFOCC Initiates Drive
For Clothing from Campus

The University Federation of Chris-
tian Concern, in collaboration with
the Circle K, will start its clothing
drive tomorrow. The clothes are be-
ing collected for the needy of Lex-
ington and Rockbridge County.

Boxes will be placed in convenient
locations around campus and in the
fraternity houses, The campus loca-
meet on Saturday, and for the fourth
dormitories and in Tucker Hall.

The distributor for the majority of
the clothing collected will be the
Rockbridge County Welfare Depart-
ment. The superintendant, Mrs. Wil-
liam Buchanan, wife of the political
science professor, expressed great en-
thusiasm for the drive. All clothing
that can be collected would find use
right here in Rockbridge County.

Contributions by college students
would be especially valuable since
men’s clothing is always hard for wel-
fare groups to acquire. “Pajamas and
sweaters would be especially useful,”
said Mrs. Buchanan.

However, Mrs. Buchanan was quick
to point out that only clothing which
was reasonably clean and wearable
would be of any help. “Torn rags
cannot keep anyone warm.”

Professor Writes Article

The inner recessed area of the pub-
lic stage in Renaissance Spain is the
subject of an article by Professor
L. L. Barrett published recently in
“Renaissance Drama 1967.”

While there is some doubt that the
English Renaissance stage had such
a recessed area, there is evidence of
its existence in Spanish stages at the
time, Dr. Barrett notes. His article,

which grew out of discussion of a
paper he presented two years ago in
Chicago at a Conference on Research
Opportunities in Renaissance Drama,
examines this evidence.

The Girls

Ever since Yale and Vassar announced their forthcoming
merger, breaking that invisible barrier which used to exist
between all women’s colleges and all men’s colleges, students
at the various institutions around Virginia have been specula-
tively eyeing their neighbors’ campuses and filling the columns
of their respective newspapers with letters and articles eulogiz-
ing the intellectual benefits to be obtained from co-education.

 

“Picture it,” said an anonymous letter to the University of
Virginia’s Cavalier Daily recently: “Seated next to you in
class, goddess in long blonde hair—sensual lips, oozing sex-
uality—long legs extending through micro skirt, sending waves
of excitement.” (A Sweet Briar columnist, reading this, com-
mented to her readers: “Aren’t we glad they don’t know how
it really would be? Any distance surely makes the heart grow
fonder.”’)

Assuming, however, that there are also other, more in-
tellectual results to be obtained from co-education—something
on a little higher plane than that envisioned by the U.Va.
letter-writer—the idea of a feminine touch in our education
is not one to be ignored. “Intellectually,” one of our own
columnists has written, “women are here to stay in all fields
of endeavor. It is generally recognized that they are signifi-
cantly more serious students than men. Their attitude would
do W&L no harm.”

Of course, no one is seriously contending that W&L
should, like Yale, absorb girls into its student body. “What
is needed,” wrote our columnist, “is a setup that renders the
benefits of both the coed and segregated situation.”” A number
of other students and professors here have been heard to say
much the same thing.

It seems that similar thoughts are running through the
minds of some of our neighbors. Next week rehearsals begin
for a dramatic reading of a new play to be presented here and
at Mary Baldwin College by a cast drawn from both schools.
The event is the first time within memory that any such joint
dramatic presentation has been attempted.

A more ambitious program is presently before the student
curriculum committee at Randolph-Macon Women’s College,
which would establish a joint seminar with W&L beginning
next semester. The project’s supporters hope to make it
eventually possible for students to take the program for credit;
and the enthusiasm which appears to have been aroused for it
among both faculty and students there is a good omen for
its success. At present, contact is being made with organizations
here in order to raise support for the project at W&L.

The pious clergymen who founded Augusta Academy in
1749 for the instruction of young gentlemen would no doubt
have looked with a baleful eye on joint seminars with young
ladies, and perhaps for their day and age they were correct.
At W&L we still haven’t progressed much farther—most
Wa&L students seem to regard the girls at nearby schools as
creatures who date but never think. A Wé&L-Macon seminar
might be a big step in a different direction.

A Minor Complaint

We'd also like to pass on a complaint we've been hearing
a lot about lately; a number of freshmen are beginning to
notice just how seldom their dorm counselors are ever around.
Granted, a dorm counselor's duties are so nebulous that he
can hardly be blamed if he goes to the movies instead of sitting
around his room thinking up ways to be a dorm counselor.
But there are also dorm counselors who haven't been seen since
freshman camp. We're reminded of the football player a few
years ago who had a refrigerator blocking the door into one
of his dorm sections, so that the door couldn't be opened.
He didn’t like the freshmen in that section.

We suppose that most of the dorm counselors are reason-
ably conscientious. But there is a small minority of counselors
who ought to take a good second look at their responsibilities
and fulfill them.

Dance Board Problems, Part Il

 

By RON KESSLER

(Editor’s note: The following is
the second of a series of articles
concerning the Washington and Lee
Dance Board and its problems).

The Washington and Lee Dance
Board has problems, as shown in last
Friday’s Ring-tum Phi. The major
problem is the fact that the combos
which are consistently chosen by
Dance Board polls of the student
body are irresponsible.

As a case in point, Jr. Walker
signed a contract with the Dance
Board early in September, and re-
ceived one-half of the contract price.
On Friday, 27 October, one day be-
fore the scheduled performance,
WA&L’s agent, Stan Rubin of the Col-
lege Entertainment Agency in New
York, called to inform the Board
that Walker would not show for the
obviously ludicrous reason that his
organist could not be with him,
Walker also gave up two other con-
certs in the South, at $2500 each, a
total of $7500 forfeited for the sake
of an organ. It appears that when
a group can demand and get $2500
for a fifty minute concert, it can
afford to dump on a few measly
colleges.

Contracts are strictly ome-way
deals, in favor of the entertainment.
So-called “act of God” clauses per-
mit groups to back out at any time
for such “acts of God” as automobile

Irresponsible Groups

of which are next to impossible to
prove. Car trouble was Sam and
Dave's excuse for backing out of
Springs last year.

An article (bylined Herm Schoen-
feld) in the 5 October 1966 edition
of Variety headed “NO-SHOWS
VEX CAMPUS MKT: Eye Legal
Curb Vs. Delinquents,” began

“The college market for  profes-
sional talent, which has grown into
one of the most lucrative sectors of
show business in the last few years,
is still being plagued by irresponsible
performers, Althouga paying top dol-
lar and providing ideal working con-
ditions, the student concert promoters
are being victimized by numerous
singers and combos who accept dates
and then duck out at the last minute.

“The students who promote the
campus shows repeatedly have been
forced to search desperately for sub-
stitutions when the original name
booked for that date has hung them
up until the last moment. In some

cases the talent pleads illness; in
other cases, transportation break-
downs.

“In most cases, it’s believed that
the talent accepted the college date
on the premise that if it could be
fitted into an overall booking pat-
tern, it would be played. If it doesn’t
fit, tough luck for the colleges.”

There are certain people who are
presently working to improve the situ-
ation, although the immediate future

Interview With
Klaude Quirk

(Since Sunshine Governor Klaude
Quirk will speak at the 1968 Mock
Republican Convention, The Friday
Ring-tum Phi arranged for a mock
interview. It was conducted over the
telephone by staff writer Bernie Feld.
Following is a transcript of that in-
terview.)

Quirk: Hello.

R-t Phi: Gov. Quirk, this is Wash-

We thought an interview with you
would help lighten our Homecomings
edition.

Quirk: Why sure boys. You got any
questions for me, just shoot, Always
happy to help out young people.
R+ Phi: Do you think the South
will rise again?

Quirk: I'm from Alabama, God rest
its soul, and quite frankly we some-
times like to think that we're mem-
bers of the United States, too. I hear
people say “South” like it’s a dirty

 

word, | object to that, and I tell them
| that the Sunshine State is the ninth
| state in the union, alphabetically, of
course.
Phi: Do you see any chance
lof the Republican party getting the
Negro vote?
Quirk: | don't go for that block vote
stuff. Why as | was telling H. Rap
Brown at a black power hate rally
in Tampa yesterday there's no such
thing as white people or Negroes
around here; we're all soul brothers
| R-t Phi: | hope you won't take this
personally, but do you feel that your
party is handicapped because so many
of you have been divorced?
Quirk: Why | think | can stand on
my record. My 19 years of marriage
were very fruitful. | have about four
beautiful kids and any one of them
could lick Luci Baines or Linda Bird
with one hand behind his back

Besides that Americans don't vote
for a person because of his image
they vote for the man on his merit
That's always been the phiosophy of
the Republican party, We don't need
to work on the image when we can
offer the people the best candidates
to do the job like Ronnie Reagon or

person working for improvement in
this area is Stan Rubin, the Dance
Board agent. To continue from the
same Variety issue,

“Stan Rubin, head of College En-
tertainment Inc., which represents
colleges in the buying of talent, is
moving to curb the irresponsibles.
He’s attempting to organize the col-
lege deans, who supervise the campus
concerts, to put them in a position to
take legal steps against delinquent
talent.

“Rubin is also trying to devise a
new type of contract with a cutoff

date. If the talent or the talent
agency does not return a_ contract
before a_ specified deadline, there

would be no deal.

“Rubin said that under existing
union and contractual regulations, the
talent has the colleges over a barrel.
Firstly, the colleges must sign the
proposed contract and send along a
deposit, usually amounting to 50%
of the total price. Then the schools
have to sit back and wait until the
talent returns the contract.

“Sometimes, the contract is re-
turned after the date is played. Some-
times, it’s never returned since the
act decided to run out on the date
because it was too far away from
the last booking .. .

“Rubin estimates that about 50%
of the performers booked for the
college circuit are guilty of playing
fast and loose with the schools. He
said that the top names, who can

By WILLIAM G. HEIGOLD
Assistant Professor of French

One of the infallible and most re-
warding tests of the timeless veracity
and beauty of great myths, regardless
of native culture, is their adaptation
and reinterpretation by other cultures
and subsequent generations. The 20th
century has often done impressive and
strikingly successful justice to ancient
myths in several media.

The theater and the cinema may
be especially proud of homage which
they have paid to the “Ancients,”
particularly to the Greeks. We need
only recall the legends of Oedipus,
Electra, Antigone, or Orpheus and
many plays and films of our century
come to mind

Racine or Euripides

What has prompted this prelude is
the fact that the Lyric Theater (Lex
ington’s Opera Comique) is currently
presenting Phaedra, a film of Jules

Dassin released in America in 1962
The film is supposed to be, it seems
an adaptation of Racine’s I7th-cen

tury reinterpretation of
tragedy, Mippolytus, one of the most
provocative of Cireek legends. We
know that it is based on Racine’s play
because 1) Phaedra is the principal

7
Euripides’s |
|

 

character lin Euripides’s play, it is
Hippolyius}, 2) the character Aricia
does not appear in Euripides, and 3)
Phaedra does not write any letter in-|
culpating Hippolytus as she does
in the Greek play

What has Dassin done with (to?)
Racine’s Phedre’ lt would be unjust
to say that he is not clever in his
modernization of the play, Perhaps |
his most successful towr de force is
fo translate one Racine’s
tenuous effecis (the sea monster which

jp susible reality that wm, the truck

Phaedra: “Panders To Popular Taste”

which
char

forces Hippolytus’s car (i.e.

chariot) off the road.

There are other clever moderniza- |

tions: Theseus is a shipping magnate
(Theseus is in Poseidon’s debt);
Theseus is respected and admired (for
economic reasons) as was the Greek
hero (he had slain the Minotaur),
and Hippolytus (who is called Alexis
in the film, as though no one should
be named Hippolytus) has eyes only
for sports as the Euripidean
hero was more enthusastic about the
hunt (the cult of Diana) than about
the chase (the cult of Aphrodite)
Moreover, Phaedra, Theseus,
Ocenone are admirable examples of

command around $5000 per night,
can be depended on to show up
promptly.

“The lesser acts, who get from
$500 to $2,000 per night, are hardly
as dependable and their rate of
truance from firm commitments is

discouraging to both Rubin and the
colleges. In one case, Rubin sent an
agent a deposit four months ago for
a certain group, but now it turns out
that the agent can’t find the act.

“Rubin pointed out that now firm,
new regulations have to be set down
in light of the enomous growth of the
college market for talent.”

Simply contracting entertainment
to come to W&L is a serious problem.
For one thing, the dates are de-
termined by the University, and are
fixed; it is impossible for the Dance
Board to vary its dates to correspond
with open dates of desired enter-
tainers,

According to Dance Board Presi-
dent Paul Brower, “contracting these
groups is a result of a long process
of elimination, We have to consider
at least fifteen names before we can
get one who will meet our price, and
who is available in the sense of not
being booked on our dates, and being
in this area at the time. Some groups
won't perform unless they have at
least one other concert in the area.
Also, a great number of groups
whom we might consider play only
only on the West Coast or in Eng-

land.”

Fable of Bathos

Up to this point, Racine has been
respected, And then, grands Dieux,
what was a reasonably faithful and
satisfactory interpretation of Phedre,
a myth of “high tragedy,” becomes a
fable of bathos which panders to pop

“Give ‘em a deflated football,”

he was planning to stop Southwest-

most times this year been great, but

Racine Is

‘Obliterated’

(Continued from page 2)

may afford one of the most memor-
able scenes of seduction in films, and
one of the most photographically
beautiful (as well as one of the most
titillating to students), but the whole
raison d'etre of the tragedy is thereby
destroyed. It is his resistance which
infuriates Phedre and increases her
feeling of guilt.

If he has yielded, there is no rea-
son for her anger (Except that she
is stuck with Perkins), There is no
reason for her terrible lie to Theseus
which ironically destroys Hippolytus.
Oenone and Aricia no longer have
any role to play.

In short, both Euripides and Racine
are obliterated. The film then de-
pends for its tragedy upon Phaedra’s
avowal to Theseus (A la Princesse de |
Cleves), which is subject matter for
soap Opera, not “high tragedy.” (Time,
Oct. 26, 1962, assures you that you
will see “high tragedy”).

What will you see? Not high
tragedy! Not Racine! You will find
potential for what might have been
an exceptional modernization of a
Greek legend. Some exceptionally
beautiful filming. Rewarding acting
on the part of Mercouri and Vallone.
A desire aroused, | hope, to read
Racine’s Phedre. But that can be
accomplished without the film.

stepping stone to the NAIA tourna-

not, have already packed up
uniforms for the season and sup-
posedly do not want to bother shak-
ing out the mothballs. So the VISA
Tournament, supposed to be con-
tested between the numbers one
through four soccer teams in the
state, has devolved into a meaning-
less battle between the state's third
i(W&L), fourth (EM), sixth (U.Va.),
and ninth (VMI) ranked teams,

The only real loser in the comings
and goings that has brought the tour-
nament to its present low state is the
Washington and Lee soccer team. The
Generals started the season slowly
and dropped early important games,
but finally jelled as a unit and finish-
ed strongly to post a respectable 7-3
record, If Roanoke and Randolph-
Macon had decided to play in the
tourney, the Blue would have had
a chance to prove that it was not the
same team that had previously lost
to the Maroons and the Jackets 3-0
and 2-1, respectively.

But VISA is an ignored organiza-
tion, except by Coach Joe Lyles, who
was instrumental in its founding. Al-
though the dates for the tournament
are set for as far ahead as 1975, the
Virginia schools who belong to other
soccer-playing conferences (all do ex-
cept W&L and Eastern Mennonite)
seem to hold other loyalties above
their nominal VISA committment.

Granted that Roanoke seems to

Jinx Time At Wilson Field

(Continued from page 3)

If two things should help W&L's
bid for a second CAC victory, (the
Generals are now 1-1-0 in the league),
it should be Andy Bloom's throwing
coupled with Homecoming festivities,
an occasion thath usually produces a
winner.

Senior quarterback Bloom, who
has connected on 54 of 104 passes
for 598 yards and two scores, threw
for 224 yards against Sewanee dur-
ing his best day of the season, com-
pleting 19 out of 33 attempts.

And if the Homecoming jinx works
on Southwestern like it has against
teams for the past seven years, then
the Generals must have a tremendous
edge.

IFC-Faculty Coffee Date
Changed to Thursday
After Thanksgiving

Ihe date of the IFC-Faculty coffee
has been changed to November 30,
IFC President Ellis Zahra announced
last night at the regular meeting.
The topic for the coffee remains “De
ferred Rush,” and it is hoped that
there will be a debate on the subject
also,

On the subject of deferred rush, the
IFC plans to write the national head
quarters of the 18 fraternities to find
out their concerning the suc-
cess or failure of deferred rush plans
at other chapters.

On the matter of freshman pledg-
ing-to-come, Zahra asked that fra-
ternities use discretion and temper-
ance in their requirements of pledges
after the mid-semester. He also said
that activities may not begin until
all the pledges have picked up their
grades at the end of this week.

As passed by the outgoing IFC of
year, a freshman who makes
than a 1.5 at the mid-semester
may not be required to do anything
by the fraternity. If his grades remain
below 1.5 at the semester, he is aulo
matically de-pledged

cation. The requesting upper-
classmen’s applications for the Library

Committee was in error, and the
situation will be resolved later this
week.

Mid-Term Exam Reform

The EC considered the complex
problems of attempting to ease the
“unfair burden” of mid-semester tests
in which many students have to take
three or four important hour tests
within a two-day period. Herb Cren-
shaw moved that the University should
send a letter to the parents explain-

ing fully the meaning of mid-term
grades: how they are derived and

their ultimate influence on the stu-

requested interviews with |

Gar- |

| dent’s semester grade.

| A part of the Crenshaw
resolution stated that administrative
| grades should be completely abolish-
ed, but if a professor has no alterna-
but to give an administrative
grade it should be marked as such
and explained on the mid-semester
report. Steve Sandler seconded this
motion which passed 8-0.

Wick Vellines then moved that mid
term hour tests be scheduled in a
manner similar to that of the final
exams. This resolution passed 5-3
In favor were Jody Kline, Wick
Vellines, Lee Halford, Herb Cren-
shaw and Butch West. Those opposed
were Joe Matthews, Steve Sandler and
Joe Tompkins. Absent were Gil Faulk,
Dan Leonard and Pete Hendricks.
The sentiment of some of those op-
posed to the motion seemed to be
that this woul lead to the ultimate
creation of a “little exam period.”

In other action last night the EC
heard Barry Levin request a resolu-
tion supporting Fancy Dress Presi

An Excess of Stupidity |

The weekend’s series of homecoming-display-burnings is
one of the most irresponsible things anybody on this campus
has done in a long, long while. Just when fraternities most need
a sense of solidarity, when they most need to present some sort
of non-pernicious image, wholesale malicious destruction, such
as the late arson, cannot but hurt—and hurt a lot, for a long
time. We saw the Lambda Chi display go up—and still find it
hard to believe that anybody could have done it, hoping to go
undetected. The display was ON the front of the house, not
constructed out in the yard; it was ignited while more than a
hundred people were IN the house. (Any “might-have-hap-
pened” thinking is unstomachable.) Why? There isn’t even
any major rivalry between the Lambda Chi’s and Kappa Sigs
(three of whose members allegedly set the fire). Sour grapes
because Lambda Chi won first place in the display contest
again this year?

 

The burning of other displays, out in the yards well re-
moved from the houses, which took place before we knew
of the house-burnings, had annoyed us because it showed
an infantile disregard for the efforts of others (the award.
winning displays were almost all among the first to go—who
are other students to decide when these displays ought to be
destroyed?) . But the ultimate, as practiced against the Lambda
Chi house, is inexcusable. (The Sigma Chi house burning,
of which nobody has yet been officially accused, occurred under
similar and equally repelling circumstances—and was the
result, apparently, of about the same guttural level of conduct

as the Lambda burning.)

We are glad nobody thinks highly at all of students who
find their kicks burning houses, not just displays. We are

glad nobody thinks very highly at all of members of the guilty

house who talked in class Saturday morning of the house’s
plans to burn one or more displays that night.

But we’re not glad of the inevitable effect such senseless
viciousness has on fraternities as a whole. The fire department
is not happy; neither are the police; neither is the Hill. We
like the system, and want it to prosper. At this rate, though,
it simply won't. This weekend's drastically misplaced enthus-

iasm (to put it as benignly as possible) is the biggest single |

windfall of ammunition the system’s enemies could ever have

hoped for. If anything can “kill” fraternities, this sort of |

thing is it. People don’t have to look to anti-democracy, anti
intellectualism, anti-individualism, the potential human de
gradation brought on by pledge programs or any other theore-
ticals. They have this, and this may well be enough.

Should Faculty

Dress ‘Custom’?

The following remarks were ad-
dressed to the alumni on Oct. 7 and
were offered in the context of a
statement by Dr, Duvall suggest-
ing the problems of getting and
keeping a first-rate faculty at 2
small liberal arts college; the com-
ment was interpolated in response
to alumni concern for the apparent
lapse of conventional dress, and
particularly to one suggestion that
students be admitted only upon an
agreement to abide by customs of
the University.

Committee member on the issue of
dress which you raised yesterday—
and to speak bluntly.

For myself, for nearly all of the
faculty members on the Admissions
Committee, and for a significant num-
ber of newer faculty members (and,
I would be willing to guess, for a very
large number of the total faculty), I
think the faculty would turn you down

yesterday about qualifying admission

in a certain away.

And I think that we would turn
it down on the basis of the very
virtues we have and the dangers we
as faculty members have to oppose.

| am speaking now for those of us
who were concerned about your con-
cern yesterday. I should say paren-
thetically that I too, like a student
who maintains the customs (ways of
dress of are customs rather
than traditions): | grew up amid such
customs myself: one of your natural
enemies [The University of Virginia]

Cocktail Party
Leads To Chaos

At Inauguration

Love, ‘tis said, and alcohol make
the world go round. And specially at
inaugurations of university presidents,
it seems. Consider Wesleyan (the
Wesleyan, that is). They installed a
new one a couple of weeks back, and
a many-splendored affair to remem-
ber it was.

“Virtually all [at the reception after-
wards, when things got really lively]
were consuming prodigious quantities
of alcohol!” cried an incensed fresh-
man letter-to-the-editor writer. (Like
ad-writers for two-star novies, we
add the ! “for emphasis only.”)

“Uninvited students wishing to at-
tend the reception were — stealing
through the side doors, and were even
approaching departing guests, request-
ing that the now-uneeded invitations
be donated to them!”, Carrie-Nation-
come-lately invected.

And, shame of shames, “After
gaining admission through misrepre-
sentation and stealth [!], these in-
terlopers, rather than conduct them-
selves appropriately, proceeded to con-

Generals’ Offense Scores

Big Homecoming Triumph

By RIC BERARD

For the 3500 spectators, last Satur-
day’s football game against South-
western promised
to be a long and
dreary affair. After
all, the Generals
had just lost the
preceding “mis-
match” between
themselves and
Sewanee, 43-0, and
it was Sewanee
who in turn had
succumbed to the
Lynx, 31-16. In
addition, South-
western had a great

 

BERARD

deal of momentum accrued from its.

last three victories in a row as its
aerial game seemed to be maturing
at a startling rate with each passing
victory. And, last but not least, their
offensive and defensive lines left pock
marks wherever they ambled on Wil-
son Field.

Unfortunately for our visitors, how-
ever, they and their coach,
Johnson, may have let these statistics
and others go to their heads. For it
was Washington and Lee that soon
established itself as the team to beat
in the conflict. It was W&L’s de-
fense that stormed back after last
week’s debacle and made the passing
game of Randy McKean and Bruce
Cook fall flat and the spectacular,
diving grasps of their excellent ends
somewhat less than meaningful. And
it was the great kicking of Rudd
Smith that throughout the afternoon

continually placed the Lynx offensive |

game in bad field position.

However this is not the reason

WAL won last Saturday. Rather, after | -

enduring weeks of practice and critic-
ism, the W&L offensive unit came
alive and obliterated the opposition.
Under the leadership and arm of
Andy Bloom, Washington and Lee
finally carried the game to the opposi-
tion in convincing fashion. Mixing his
plays very well, Bloom devastated
their secondary with passes up the
middle where they were usually di-
rected towards the most gifted re-
ceiver out on the field that day,
flanker Bucky Cunningham. But Andy
also used sweeps to both sides, quick-
Openers up the middle and power
plays to disect his beleaguered vic-
tims. Bill McDavid equaled his en-
tire scoring total of last year in
Saturday's game when he plunged
over the same, humiliated right tackle

Jesse |

of Southwestern for both of our third
period scores. Earlier, Big Luke had
squashed their left guard and tackle
on a second period scoring plunge
which had only been preceded minutes
before by a Bucky Cunningham pass
pattern that left himself and the
referee alone and happy in the middle
of the end zone. Also, just for kicks,
Cary Green connected for a 35-yard
field goal with 1:40 left in the first
half.

And so, W&L’s “homecoming
jinx” is extended to eight games, with
a 30-13 victory over the Lynx. But,
unless | am missing the mark, Satur-
day’s victory was not a meaningless
/extension of an unrelated sequence
of victorious affairs. This past week’s
display of skill and desire was no
fluke, no lucky victory by an aroused
but out-classed team. If anyone ever
doubted that the Generals possessed
the potential, their doubts should have
been dispelled. This game was clearly
the best game of the season for the
Generals and another hard-fought
contest next week will assure W&L
of at least a tie with Sewanee for the
CAC title.

For, while the offense moved the
ball and scored with it continually
and finally began to think touchdown
instead of field goal, last Saturday
was a team effort. No one could have
asked more from the team. Once
again, Scott Mackenzie, John Wolf,
John Harris, Charlie Freret et al, led
the defense up and over the Lynx
offensive line while blanketing their
receivers and intercepting their errant
| passes. And it was the gaping holes
long four years fo rmany of us. Now

At the state cross country meet

with 30:57 and placed 41.

William and Mary completely
dominated the meet with its 1, 2, 3
finish. Although WA&L’s time was
better than at its last Richmond meet,
the competition with some of the
other schools was tough, and even
our best runners were clearly out-
classed.

‘Keep Off The Mats’

 

Football IM’s Near Finish

By GEORGE MacFARLAND

A sign over in the “Mus” gym

says “Keep Off The Mats.” This re-|

porter was greatly surprised to dis-
cover last Thursday that D.U., PiKA,
Phi Phi and Phi Kap_ were
systematically seeking to violate that
obvious direction.

Of the four only the Phi Kaps
failed in their insidious plots to violate
a university policy to keep people,
dogs, cats, etc. off the mats. No mat-
ter now hard they tried, everytime
they had a chance to get on the mat
a D.U. would get there first.

After it was all over it looks like
a big match between Pi Phi and Phi
Kap. It should be entertaining. If it
proves to be a mismatch as some
believe, then the spectator may turn
his attention to Coach Leslie and his
J.V. squad. He has some fine boys on
what promises to be a strong club.

W&L Soccer Wins
VISA’s Tournament

By LAURENCE M. HILLIARD

Despite a very serious lack of scor-
ing punch, the Generals’ soccer team
managed to squeeze by two lackluster
opponents this weekend to win the
Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer As-
sociation tourney at Smith Field. The
Generals, top-seeded in the four team
field, knocked out  fourth-seeded
V.M.1. 2-0 on Friday afternoon, then
came back to defeat second-seeded
Eastern Mennonite College, (a 5-4
victor over third-seeded University
of Virginia in the other semi-final) 2-1
on Saturday to capture the champ-
ionship. U.Va. grabbed third place
with a 3-0 conquest of V.M.1.

The tournament was hampered by
a very weak field. The four teams
entered were ranked 3rd (W&L), 4th
(E.MC.), 6th (UVa), and 9th
(V.M.1.). ‘Top-ranked Roanoke had a
date with Loyola of Baltimore for
the Mason-Dixon Conference Champ-
ionship, with an NCAA bid probably
going to the winner, and did not want
to risk a disabling injury. Second-
ranked Randolph-Macon declined for
the second year for reasons known
only to God and the R-MC athletic
department. Fifth-ranked Lynchburg
entered instead the Dixie Conference
tourney with an eye on an NAIA bid.
Seventh rated and defending VISA
champion VPI decided that they did
not have a chance for the tourney
with a 2-5 mark against state oppon-
ents, and called it a season after the
final game. V.M.I. was probably
chosen over eighth-ranked William
and Mary because if a team is going
to lose twice in a row (no one doubt-

ed that either V.M.I. or W&M would
do), it is better to come across town
instead of across the state.

Captains-Elect Star

Scott Fechnay and Thom Mitchell,
co-captains of next year’s team, led
the Generals to victory in the tourney.
Left-Inside Fechnay scored all four
goals for the Generals, three on pen-
alty kicks, and Goalie Mitchell stopped
all but one of nineteen shots taken
on him,

The Generals had an unexpectedly
tough time against V.M.I., a team
that lost every game this season.
Fechnay’s two penalty kicks, in the
second and fourth quarters, were the
only scoring of the game.

The Generals had an even tougher
time against E.M.C. The visitors
brought a large gallery of fans with
them (it surprised nobody that they
out-shouted the Generals’ Homecom-
ing “crowd”), and started out as if
they meant to pull an upset. Early
in the first quarter Left-Inside Kop-
perhaver converted a pass from
Right-Outside Swartz to give E.M.C.
a 1-0 lead. Fechnay knotted the score
in the second stanza by making good
on another penalty kick. He then won
the game with an unassisted goal at
12:15 of the third period. For his fine

rather than a grade based on work
attempted.

3) A test schedule similar to the
one recently adopted for final ex-
aminations should be set up rior
to the end of the mid-semester
period. Each class hour should have
one day on which a test could be
given. This would be arranged so
that the day of the last test would
be enough in advance so as to
| give the professor enough time to
grade them before the mid-semester
reports are due, Professors, of
course, may give tests prior to this
testing period or they do not have
to give one at all, Weekly tests

would not be affected by this
scheduling.
The Executive Committee feels

that the adoption of any or all of
the above proposals will make a more
equitable system for students and pro-
fessors alike and that it will clear up
many of the ambiguities about mid-
semester grades which exist under the
present system.

it that the EC gives its support to
the collection of freshman dues at

offers to W&L and VMI students

both mental and physical recreation.

This organization functions _ pri-
marly with the purpose of present-
ing a popular Sunday night program
on political, social, and economic
concern of the present, removing it-
self from the religious implications
of the church.

One such program was a five-week
symposium, held earlier this semester,
on the war in Vietnam. Discussions
on the draft, conscienious objectors
an dthe war itself were held and sup-
plemented by speakers from the Lex-
ington Local Draft Board, the Lexing-
ton Committee on Vietnam, and Mr.
John H. Fielder, instructor in philo-
sophy and against the war in Vietnam,

Next semester, during February
and the first half of March, another
program will be presented by the
Foundation, this one concerning racial
prejudice. Mr. Bud Coiner, a local
minister, is setting up this symposium

now and plans to center it around
audio-visual aids. Movies are being|~~
scheduled and speakers are being

He gave as his reasons the pres-

years, and established “Organization

Another possibility for a tie-in is

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University's T'wice-Weekly Newspaper

An Aside To Tuesday

While we don’t like to disagree with our colleagues on the
Tuesday Edition, we have to take exception to some of the
opinions they presented in last Tuesday’s editorial, “An Ex-
cess of Stupidity.”

 

Granted, “the weekend’s series of homecoming-display-
burnings is one of the most irresponsible things anybody on
this campus has done in a long, long while.’ Granted, “‘it
showed an infantile disregard for the efforts of others.”
Granted, ‘we are glad nobody thinks highly at all of students
who find their kicks burning houses, not just displays.” We
will even agree that it was “An Excess of Stupidity.”

Unfortunately, there were also conclusions drawn in the
editorial which we can not agree with. Its basic assumption
seems to have been that a given fraternity is responsible for
the actions of every one of its members, however much it may
condemn those actions itself. Guilt apparently spreads to the
innocent by association, and the sins of the few are to be visited
upon the many. If we admit this principle, then hereafter we
may require fraternities to pay parking tickets, fine them for
overdue libray books, and put their entire memberships on
trial for honor violations.

Since the Tuesday edition made this assumption, of course,
it is not surprising to find them making a similar one, which is
that the fraternity system is responsible for the actions of every
fraternity member. “...We’re not glad of the inevitable
effect such senseless viciousness has on fraternities as a whole,”
says the editorial. That’s nice to know, but we disagree with
the assumption made in that statement. We do not think that
such an effect is or should be “inevitable.” And we do not
think that those in positions of responsibility will consider it
“inevitable.”

The fraternities in question cannot be made responsible for
what one or two of their members have done or said they would
do or are alleged to have done. The fraternity system can not
be made responsible for the actions of the members of any
particular fraternity. It is the kind of misconceptions which
appeared in Tuesday’s editorial, not the incidents this weekend,
which harm the fraternity system—and harm it unjustly.

No, Thanks

We were glad to hear that the EC, after successfully initiat-
ing action which led to the reform of the semester exam
schedule by the faculty earlier this month, has taken on the
problem of that old horror, mid-semester grades. Explaining
that “administrative C” to your parents has been justly likened
to serving up spinach to cannibals—their attitude is usually that
you've gotta be kidding. (“Er, Dad—on my report card there'll
be a C. It doesn’t mean anything. Honest.”’)

So we wouldn’t mind seeing the end of administrative
grades. And the proposal that a covering letter be sent out to
the parents explaining the nature and significance of mid-
semester grades would be an excellent innovation. We certainly
endorse both of these excellent proposals.

But we do have some misgivings about the idea of a mid-
semester exam schedule, and to judge from the vote on it in the
EC (5 for, 3 against) at least some of the EC members must
think so, too. The purpose of such a schedule would be to
spread mid-semester exams out over a two-week period, one
day being alloted to each block hour. In this way it would
be impossible for any student to be caught with four important
mid-semester exams in two days.

The idea has its merits. On the other hand, students who
have that many tests all at once (and they are very much in
the minority) can usually prevail upon professors to change
one or more of them to a better time. And the establishment
of a schedule would probably have the effect of encouraging
the giving of mid-semester tests—something we can certainly
do without. Besides that, the importance of tests seems to be
in direct proportion to how official they are: as was remarked
at the EC meeting, a mid-semester exam schedule would prob-
ably lead to a mid-semester “little exam period.’ No, thanks.
We don’t want it.

Coburn Stars In ‘Waterhole 3;
Western Spoof Now At State

By RON KESSLER

In the mid-1940's, the vogue in
motion pictures was gangster movies
in which the anti-hero, usually Jimmy
Cagney wound up very dead either
by electrocution or by having many
holes in various parts of his body.

Coburn several times. They eventu-
ally have a shoot-em-up with one of
the original gold-robbers at, of all
places, a Ponce-like establishment,
members of whom appear in the
photograph above. In the end, every-
body is happy, except the sheriff. his
daughter, the other gold robbers. the
army and come to think of it, every-
body save James Coburn.

Bumbling Sheriff

The movie tends to fluctuate inex-
plicably between serious satire and
the sublime, although when the mood
is finally established, the latter pre-
vails. The bumbling, mumbling, leer-

In the 1950's, the straight western
was most popular, many of which

Now, it appears we are entering
the period of the western spoof. Cat

enjoyable.

man than any such clean-cut character
as Matt Dillon.

James Whitmore, playing the cav-
alry captain was evidently attempting
to depict the corn often used by such
characters as Rip Masters (a la Rin-
tin-tin).

The double ententes, now almost a
necessity for any movie to succeed,
were excellent, and will probably be
quoted behind the poolhalls for years
to come. In one situation, Coburn
has been arrested for rape, and at-

On the wall of Dana Swan’s office
in the Haverford College gymnasium
is a depth chart of
the school’s foot-
ball team. There
are 32 names
spread over Ii
positions.

“Is that the of-
fensive platoon?”
a visitor asked.
Swan, the school’s
young football
coach, laughed.
“The what?” he
replied. “We don't
have platoons here, What we do is
run our offensive team off the field,
run them around the bench and send
them back on as the defensive team.”

Of the 32 persons on the chart, 24
actually play for the Haverford Col-
lege football team. The other eight
are either injured or simply too in-
experienced.

Of the 24, seven are freshmen.
Their names — appropriately — are
marked with a green pencil. “And
they're all regulars,” Swan said,

The coach moved away from the
depth chart and returned to his desk.
From the window behind him, you
caught a glimpse of the magnificent
Haverford campus which was getting
its annual coat of falling leaves.

 

Ex-Coach Swan

Football practice was an hour
away, sO Dana Swan had a few
minutes.

He always has a few minutes. It's
not like Ara Parseghian, Dave Hart
or Bill Elias, who communicate with
the public daily through a dull, com
puterized tape recording.

Of course, not that many people
want to talk to Dana Swan. First of
all, he has a name that sounds more
attuned to ballet than football. And
second, he coaches the lowest rated
football team in the United States
(1.0 in the latest Dunkel Ratings com-
pared to 112.2 for top-ranked South
ern California)

Haverford is 0-4 this year with a
good chance of finishing 0-7. Last
weekend the team lost 69-0 to Wilkes

college champion

arm chair and also a bed, which en-
abled him to assume a great variety

sessed with the subject of biblical
prophecy, eventually announced to

end of the world. Disappeared dur-

Swan admits he sounds like Don
Quixote in football shoes. The scorn
and laughter that goes with it, does
not bother him.

“IT came here from Washington and
Lee which has the same attitude to-
ward college football,” he said. “This
is the type of program I wanted to be
involved in. It’s a fine opportunity.

zation then that's fine. Those people
are involved in business. If a coach
doesn't deliver, he's fired. If a
player doesn't produce, he might
lose a scholarship.

“At those schools, the academic life
of the player limited. But they
understand this when they take the
scholarship. They are getting what
they want from college. And they
most certainly are better off for
getting what education they do re-
ceive.

“At Haverford, of course, we have
none of that. Here. the alumni are

FOOTBALL FOR SHUT-INS

At next Saturday’s football game while you are sitting
in your choice student’s seat behind the end zone, won't
you pause and give a thought to football’s greatest and,
alas, most neglected name? I refer, of course, to Champert
Sigafoos.

Champert Sigafoos (1714-1928) started life humbly on
a farm near Thud, Kansas. His mother and father, both
named Walter, were bean-gleaners, and Champert became
a bean-gleaner too. But he tired of the work and went to
Montana where he got a job with a logging firm. Here the
erstwhile bean-gleaner worked as a stump-thumper. After
a month he went to North Dakota where he tended the
furnace ina granary (wheat-heater). Then he drifted to
Texas where he tidied up oil fields (pipe-wiper). Then to
Arizona where he strung dried fruit (fig-rigger). Then
to Kentucky where he fed horses at a breeding farm (oat-

quite perfect—one of her legs was shorter than the other

(blimp-gimper)}—she was nonetheless ravishing, what

with her tawny hair and her eyes of Lake Louise blue and

her marvelously articulated haunches. Champert, smitten,
ran quickly back to the hog-iloggery to plan the wooing.

To begin with, naturally, he would give Graffa a pres-
| ent. This presented problems, for hog-flogging, as we all
know, is a signally underpaid profession. Still, thought
Champert, if he had no money, there were two things he
did have: ingenuity and pigskin.

So he selected several high grade pelts and stitched
them together and blew air into them and made for Graffa
a perfectly darling little replica of a dirigible. “She will
love this,” said he confidently to himself and proceeded to
make ready to call on Graffa.

First, of course, he shaved with Personna Super Stain-
less Steel Blades. And wouldn’t you? If you were looking
to impress a girl, if you wanted jowls as smooth as ivory,

dewlaps like damask, a chin strokable, cheeks fondlesome,
upper lip kissable, would you not use the blade that
whisks away whiskers quickly and slickly, tuglessly and
nicklessly, scratchlessly and matchlessly ? Would you not,
in short, choose Personna, available both in Injector style
and double-edge style? Of course you would.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

Tuesday, November 21, 1967

We Think...

... our colleague on the Friday Edition, perhaps looking for
editorial fodder, inferred a number of things from our last
editorial that simply were not implied in it.

Ex Libris

‘While there has been improvement in library support in
recent years, there is substantial indication that library financ-
ing is still far below reasonable adequacy. The latest figures in
the Self-Study Report show that the University is spending
3.5% of its total educational and general expenditures for li-
brary purposes. A national minimum library standard suggested
for this ratio is 5% and the best libraries demand much more
than the minimum.”

—Report of the Visiting Committee to Washington and Lee
University, November 1966.

+

 

 

* *

In this the best of all possible worlds, the McCormick Li-
brary is not the best of all possible libraries. The report of the
Visiting Committee goes on to state, “By whatever gauge one
uses, Washington and Lee’s support of its library lags.” We
feel that the University must move promptly and firmly
until McCormick Library is above standard. W&L cannot af-
ford government by crisis, waiting until the last possible mom-
ent before salvaging the library.

A library is often considered to be one of the most im-
portant assets of a college or university. It is not by coincidence
that Yale and Harvard have two of the world’s best libraries.

There are, however, several changes that can be made
which will immediately benefit the student body without pro-
hibitive expense.

First, the library should be opened earlier on Sundays.
Apparently students are not supposed to be intellectually in-
clined until 3 p.m. on Sundays. This is patently untrue. Any
check of the campus at noon or earlier will indicate a large
number of students who do, indeed, study on Sunday morn-
ing. The major reason given for keeping the library closed
during this time is that there is not enough money to pay
someone to man the desk for three additional hours. But any
glance at the desk evenings will usually reveal a student and
a library assistant manning the check-out desk. This appears
to be a wasteful duplication of resources, considering the in-
ability to finance three additional hours on Sundays.

Of secondary priority would be keeping the library open
later on weeknights. The lights on in the fraternity houses and
dormitories at midnight show that a vast majority of students
are far from asleep at this time. The library should be kept

 

open until 2 a.m. or later to accommodate these students.

We would suggest a month trial period to determine if the
student demand is high enough to continue the practice. If
this is not possible a sincere effort should be made to keep
the library open until 2 a.m. during exam period and the week
preceding it.

It seems folly to deny the student body the use of one of
the University’s most valuable assets when there is sufficient
demand for its use. And it seems equal folly not to finance the

lib to its full potential.

Highlights Of A

Trip Through

Ye Olde McCormicke Librarye

By MILLARD FILLMORE

Can anyone imagine a greater thrill
than being the first person in 91
years to check out a library book?
No. There is no human experience
greater than being the very first per-
son to check out the Rev. N. M.
Ferrers’s “An Elementary Treatise on
Trilinear Co-ordinates, The Method
of Reciprocal Polars, and the Theory
of Projections,” London, 1876.

Of a lesser thrill would have been
to take out Crozet’s “Treatise on
Descriptive Geometry” which has left
the library twice (1935, 1954) since
it was published in 1821. In recent
ramblings through the ivy-covered
stacks of McCormick Library, I pick-
ed a shelf completely at random of
33 books which went from 516.0;J5Ir
to 516.57:L668p (for those not con-
versant in the Dewy Decimal System
this means Euclidean analytic geome-
try). The mean age of the books
(determined from date of being pub-
lished) was 1922.

Greatly Improved Average

The average, however, was a great-
ly improved 1924. This encourages
one to think that the math that one
learns today will still be true in
1994, so that the library will, indeed,
need not purchase any more books
on Euclidean analytic geometry.

But let’s look at another randomly
selected shelf. ... This section was
all about 943.085;L669t to 943.085;-
§559w. Here the mean copyrighted
date was 1939 and the average 1941.
Quite an improvement over Euclidean
geomentry one would say, but only
those fully versed in the quirks of Dr.
Dewey would realize that this topic
is about Hitler's Germany. There
were only three, excuse me, two
books on Hitler's Germany on that

 

shelf of 28 books that were published

after 1945...three, I mean
cheers for historical perspective.

two

Recent Acquisitions

But let's move on to the more
recent library acquisitions. In fact,
the Friends of the Library recently
donated the “Collected Works of
William Morris” which encompasses
24 volumes. Other equally significant
collections is the 37 volume “Early
Western Travels” featuring such sig-
nificant travelogues of the Early West
as “Flagg’s Far West” and “Pattie’s
Personal Narrative.” Speaking of
travelogues, Alice Marriott's “Hell
on Horses and Women” acquired in
1954 has been taken out twice by
adventurous readers.

I don’t mean to attack collected
works; collected works in moderation
are fine. For example, every library
should have the collected works of
Voltaire. The more affluent libraries
could have two—one in English, the
other in French, but the McCormick
Library has three of 42 volumes, 52
volumes, and 75 volumes. Most likely
the library did not want anyone to
be unable to read Voltaire.

Other books that are a must for
any Christmas shopper, all to be
found in McCormick Library, are the
three-volume collection of the “Writ-
ings of Wilfrid Scawen Blunt” (some-
one please take it out; it has been
the shelves since 1940 untouched by
human hands.) There is the “Col-
lected Works of the Right Honorable
John Hookam Frere.” And one can
even find “To Kill A Mockingbird”
which was donated last year by a
student who was astounded to learn
that the library did not even own a
copy, so there, you now know of
the pleasures that await in the gold-
en stacks of Ye Olde McCormicke
Librarye.

Leyburn Discusses Christianity’s Future

By LARRY HONIG

the federal government is con-
tributing just over $19,500 this year
to Washington and Lee’s Work-Study
Program, which helps students on
scholarship earn money to repay their
loans.

Added to that figure is another
$3500 from the University; the result
is that about 70 students have on-
campus jobs with hourly pay. Such
jobs include laboratory assistants—
professors may request a certain per-
son or any student—library assistants,
workers in the bookstore, research as-
sistants, and those who help in the
office of the various deans by deliver-
ing request slips, showing visitors
around the campus, and so on.

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

I would like to underscore Profes- |
sor Duvall’s comments about student
dress on campus [Tuesday Edition
November 14], to wit that it is an
individual matter best learned at home
or in the fraternity houses. Certainly,
admissions policy should have no
bearing on it. A professor worth his
salt would quit before he would
tolerate a sartorial approach as to
who gets into Washington and Lee.

But there is another side to the
coin. Some students are slovenly
dressed, unshaven, at war with socks
and neckties. The other evening in
Evans Dining Hall, one was barefoot,
taking his chances, I assume, of hook-
worm infection.

 

The point I want to make is that

W&L’s Work-Study Plan
Receives Federal Grants

Work-Study Program here is 85%,
WAL's is 15%. Next year, the gov-
ernment will pay 80%, and the year
after that it will stop at 75%.

The government makes its money
available for both on-campus jobs and
off-campus jobs in non-profit ventures,
such as for the youth corps and in
poverty work. At present W&L uses
the funds to employ students in jobs
on the campus.

New Director

Head of the program here is W&L
graduate William A. Noell, who came
in September as director of financial
aid. Asked about the possibility of
increasing the government's total dol-
lar donation, Mr. Noel said “we're
trying substantially to increase the pro-
gram.” Allocations for mext year's
program will be announced in March.

‘Are You Saved?’ Is Obsolete

(Continued from page 2)

My prediction would be that the
church is more and more going to be
conceived as the servant of all man-
kind, not just as a gathering-place for
a small social clique on Sunday morn-
ing at eleven o'clock.

Why do we need these church build-
buildings, anyhow, just standing va-

 

 

IFC-Faculty Coffee
(Continued from page 1)

stated that the topic of the coffee
would be a discussion of the exist-
ing rush system. “Have the recent
reforms improved the system?”
“Would a deferred rush be better?”—
these are the major problems that
will be faced.

Baremore stated that there will
probably be a formal presentation of
the pro’s and con's of the issue, fol-
lowed by an informal discussion.

Last year’s coffee also dealt with
the topic of a deferred rush, from
which much debate ensued, but little
consensus.

cant there 167 hours out of the 168,
wasting all that property, all that
space that might be put to good use?
My guess is that the theology of the
church will certainly come in for a
great deal of discussion....

Situation ethics, as you know, is be-
ing very much talked about nowa-
days; and there is a widespread re-
jection of the old legalism that says
absolutely that one should never kill
or that one should never lie or that
one should never remarry after di-
VOrcé, ...

The situations do change, and...
this person-centered morality is not
very satisfying for the mass of man-
kind—it may be for very intelligent
and strong-minded and sensitive per-
sons. But I'd hate, as a parent, to
have to try to bring up my children
by not laying down any rules for
them whatsoever....1 don't believe
that’s going to work....

I think the whole question of
ethics and the proper basis for eth-
ics is again one of the things that

 

will certainly be discussed from now

 

until the end of this century. ...

And the final thing I will say. .. is
that in the church itself 1 think the
struggle during the next decades is
going to be between those clergymen
and laymen on the one hand who
want to move the church to support
and to induce social change, and the
laymen and clergymen on the other
hand who want to prevent change....

| think the conflict is going to
center on that issue. So it’s going to
be a very exciting time for Christian-
ity in the next thirty years.

 

Early Admissions

40 students have been accepted by
early decision in the fourth year of
WAL’s early acceptance program.

James D. Farrar, Dean of Admis-
sions and Assistant Dean of Students,
announced that out of the 52 who
applied for early admission, 40 were
accepted. This year, although fewer
applied, a greater proportion of those
who did apply were accepted.

All early acceptance candidates
must reply by December 1 as to
whether they will come to W&L or
not,

A Short History of The R-t Phi:

The War Years, ‘The Columns’

“Never have so few owed so much
to so few....”

In the long history of the Ring-tum
Phi (for those who consider 69 years
to be “long”), perhaps the unique-est
period came during World War II
when the Ring-tum Phi wasn't even
the Ring-tum Phi. “The Columns”—
billed as the “war-time successor to
the Ring-tum Phi’—published 59 is-
sues, every Friday of the college
year, in 1943, 1944 and 1945.

They were strange times.

transfers enrolled in the University
on August 21.... This group was
somewhat larger than expected,” the
Columns reported.

They ran pictures of the entire
freshman class each year. And they
ran the sex-and-society biographies of
every student, for want of anything
else: “Yates had a date for this
dance. In fact, she slept in his
room—while he stayed at the SAE
lodge.”

Editorial Turnover

The Columns had four (or maybe
five) editors in its short life. Trouble
seemed to be that nobody stayed in
school long enough to be editor more
than a term or so. One guy, in fact,
was elected editor one day and drafted
the next, so he never even put out a
paper. (But we'll guess he put it down
on election posters, job applications
and everywhere else he could, just
like students today.)

“The State Theatre,” the Columns
announced early in “45, “will be
closed until Monday at 7 o'clock, due
to natural gas shortages.”

“Last Tuesday night the Forensic
Union discussed rather heatedly,” a
1943 issue told, “the question, ‘Re-
solved: That Eleanor Roosevelt
should be sent to a South Seas Is-
land.’ The final vote upheld the nega-
tive side of the question.” Tsk, tsk.

“Innovations”?

And some of the things “innovated”
into the Ring-tum Phi lately just
aren't as new as the Ring-tum Phi
seems to think. The football contest,
for example. Only, then it was called
“You Pick Em” and the prize wasn't
a fiver—instead, you got two free
passes to the State Theatre (known,
incidentally, during the duration as
“Marse Ralph's’).

A big flap came when the faculty
decided to change the grade-point
system (A, 93-100; B, 84-92; C, 75-
83: D, 65-74; E, $0-64; F, below 50).
The headlines are even the same,
though the faces are different: “Phil-
lips Revises Economics Text.” Ogden
M. Phillips, that is.

The Big Issues weren't all that dif-
ferent. either: one editorial expounded,
“We have been noticing some particu-
larly ‘fine’ beards recently. We saw
one upperclassman with a particularly
pretty set of whiskers. It wasn't one
of these of two or three days’ growth
It was nice and full with just enough
shagginess to give it that rustic look
which is found only in the best beards
To be a ‘real’ Washington and Lee
gentleman you wont wear a Zoot
suit, but you will wear a growth of
beard on your cheeks and upper lip

We'll loan a razor to anyone who
wants to use it.”
Let's...

They tried to forget the war. “Lets
Fall In Love.” one oblivious editor
wrote. “Lets Dance. he wrote 4
month later. “Let There Be Music,

his successor wrote. “Spring Is Here!”
greeted readers one morning, “Sweet
Briar Asks Us Over.” No fewer than
six editorials over the two school
years were called “The Honor Sys-
tem.” It had to be that way. There
were, by appearances, no fewer than
six turnovers in membership of the
student body.

The people we know of today were
in the news, or at least in the Col-
umns. President Francis Pendleton
Gaines declined, during those two
years, the presidency of Rice Institute
and the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination in Virginia, among other
offers. Capt. William Hinton and
Maj. Frank Gilliam made the paper
from time to time. So did C. Harold
Lauck, then and now superintendent
of the W&L Print Shop, printer of the
Columns—so indispensible that one
day when Mr. Lauck was sick the
paper just didn’t come out,

War Was Here
The war wasn't entirely removed
from Lexington, though. “Ki Wil-

liams, president of the Alumni As-
sociation, learned that his alma mater
was a secret repository for priceless
Government documents, which may
have included Jefferson's manuscript
of the Declaration of Independence,
only when he looked into the muzzie
of a guard's automatic pistol, he
related today,” said what is perhaps
the longest sentence (considerably
abridged here) ever printed in the
Columns.

The Special Services School made
iis presence on campus known, too.
One SSS student wrote “An Ode To
Washington and Lee,” which does
not, sad to say, bear reprinting. The
SSS staged a show for the students
every term. But we'll bet that not
even their extravaganza “Hubba Hub-
ba” (1944) compared with some of
the movies “Marse Ralph” brought
to town. Like “This Is the Army,”
by Irving Berlin and starring George
Murphy and “Lt. Ronald Reagan.”
Not to mention “Brother Rat,” about
which no more need be said.

Yes, they were lean years for news.
(Not that the situation has changed
today, which is why this article was
written.) But the Columns did well,
and came out on time nearly always,
and people read the paper, and what
more can a newspaper ask for?

failed to go the required 10 yards so
the Bears took over the ball at the
Generals’ 47 yard line. Once agin, the
General defense allowed the Bears
only negligible yardage.

Back under the leadership of Kuhn,
only halfback Luke Crosland was able
to gain significant yardage. Even
Smith’s kicking average began to suf-
fer late in the second quarter when
one kick was blocked and others fell
short due to the strong Washington
rush.

In the third quarter, after a sus-
tained Washington drive, Oliver kick-
ed a field goal to break the tie and
put the Bears ahead.

The situation looked grim for the
Generals’ offense, but Bloom returned
to the game late in the third quarter.
Still, Bloom had been suffering from
blurred vision and was able to hit
his receivers only occasionally. Flank-
er Buck Cunningham was closely
guarded throughout the second half
of the game.

 

 

—

The Bears, on the other hand,
came to life as W&L’s fine defensive
unit went flat. Lagdon repeatedly
passed to Hinton for substantial yard-
age and after the first real drive of
the game Lagdon took the ball in
for the score.

The game ended with the Generals
in possession of the ball on Wash-
ington’s 6 yard line. The final score
17-7.

The Generals’ final season record
is 5-4-0, This puts them in a three
way tie for second place along with
Centre College and Washington Uni-
versity.

Randolph-Macon Program
Presents Aspects Of Poverty

The YWCA_ of Randolph-Macon
Woman's College in Lynchburg is
sponsoring today and tomorrow a

symposium on poverty, entitled “Can

We Afford the Poor?”
Dr. Henry Clark, Professor of Re-
ligion at Duke University, Claude

Brown, author of “Manchild and the
Promised Land” and a_ speaker at
WKL’s Contact in 1966, and Dr.
Bennetta Washington, Director of
Women’s Center, Job Corps, are
scheduled to address the symposium
on Saturday.

Experienced and knowledgeable
about the theme of the seminar,
each will discuss various aspects of
the subject. Clark will discuss the
relationship of education to poverty,
Brown, the economics, and Dr. Wash-
ington, the role of government in
the war on poverty.

Tonight at 8:30 the symposium will
begin with a _ recpetion for the
speakers at Casner Lounge. A
movie, “I’m Here Now,” will follow
this, and a discussion session will be
held afterwards.

Subject of Film

“Michelangelo,” a color television
film, will be shown in duPont Hall
on December 10 and 11 at 8 p.m.

The one-hour motion picture is be-
ing brought to Washington and Lee
by the Virginia Gas Company.

Dr. Sterling Boyd, assistant
fessor in fine arts, says the film
“should be excellent. It deals with
the painting, sculpture and architec-
ture of the great Renaissance artist.”

Although the showing is scheduled
mainly for students in the Italian
Renaissance fine arts course, it is
open to everyone in the area.

This will be the second time that
this film has been presented at WAL.

Last year the full two-hour length
version was shown. Since then, it has

been cut in half.

ers will be held at 2:45 p.m. at

discussion groups, to be organized at
4 p.m. The latter will be on the
subjects of Economics and Poverty,
at Alumnae Lounge, Education and
Poverty, in Smith Lounge, and Gov-
ernment and Poverty.

The symposium will end with an
informal discussion with the speakers
in Casner Lounge at 7 p.m.

UFOCC, Circle K
Clothing Drive Nets
Record Collections

In their clothing drive ending be-
fore Thanksgiving vacation, UFOCC
and Circle K_ collected over 600
articles of clothing, John Carrere,
chairman of the drive, reported.

Carrere said that the drive was not
only numerically successful, but that
most of the clothes were of good
quality and included many warm
coats.

The drive probably will become an
annual affair, Carrere predicated.
Initiated by the Rockbridge County
Welfare Department, the drive col-
lected clothes to be used exclusively
by the needy in the county. Mrs.
William Buchanon co-ordinated the
drive with the towns people.

Carrere especially commended con-
tributions by the Law Wives’ Associa-
tion and the PiPhis. Other groups
who supported the drive enthusias-
tically were SAE, Lambda Chi, Delt,
Sigma Nu, Phi Kap, DU, Phi Delt,
and the upperclass dorm.

Carrere, a Delt, was helped by
Bob Brigham of the Law School and
Bill Ridley, SAE and president of
Circle K.

Student Literary

Society Formed
Thursday Night

A new organization came into
existence last night in the form of a
student literary society.

Under the auspices of Mike Nation,
its founder, and Dabney Stuart,

as-
sistant professor of English, the fac-
ulty advisor, the club hopes to re-
place previous creative writing as-

sociations, either defunct or presently
serving other purposes.

The primary goals of the club are
first, to give the students a voice in
contracting or writing to prominent
writers to speak at Washington and
Lee, and secondly, to allow students

to have their own works read and
discussed by both students and fac-
ulty members.

The organizational committee
elected at a meeting on Thursday

night were Mike Nation, Bernie Feld,
Mark Faverman, Dave Walder, Kirk
Woodward, Steve Greenia and Dick
Batton, The Committee met immedi-
after the main meeting and
drew up the club's tentative organiza-
tion, subject to approval at the next
meeting (Wednesday, December 6 at
in Evan’s Dining Hall). At
this time a name for the organization

i will be discussed.

The club is planning to apply for
funds from the Executive Committee
in order to contract speakers, It in-
tends to form a coalition with other
| literary organizations.

It is hoped that the organization
will be able to honor those students
in the junior and senior classes who
have made outstanding contributions

Too Many Doctors

Ah, traditions. They make one’s heart pop out in flags,
bugles, and old fight songs.

Except one. That old, old business about referring to
every professor or instructor or visiting lecturer you see as
“doctor,” which is easily the tiredest tradition around. And
unfortunately, unlike a number of more respectable traditions
at W&L, this particular practice seems likely to stay with us
for a long time.

Can there be any professor (or instructor, or visting lec-
turer) around who is still flattered at being called “doctor’’?
Probably not. Yet the first thing the blithe freshman learns
is to address every balding individual over 25 whom he sees
as “doctor.” The ones who really are Ph.D.’s find the title
debased by so much use. (We hope.) The ones who aren’t
are embarrassed by it. (We hope.) Actually, we don’t even
really need to look to the faculty to find the perpetrators of
this hoary flattery. This is the case of one tradition which is
being held up by the students in the face of faculty opposition.

One professor, who is so consistently called ‘‘doctor” that
it’s beginning to sound like part of his last name, has suggested
that students at Southern schools are more attracted to titles
than students at Northern schools. The same instinct which
hatched hundreds of Southern “colonels” after the Civil War
is apparently still at work. The only thing wrong with this
explanation is the fact that at the University of Virginia, which
is as Southern as W&L can claim to be, a simple “Mr.” seems
sufficient.

An advice-to-the-lovelorn column (Amy Vanderbilt, no
less) recently ran a letter on the subject by a Columbia pro-
fessor. For what it’s worth, we reprint part of what he said:

“At most leading universities it is assumed that all per-
sons of professional rank (assistant to full) will have a Ph.D.
Hence they are called ‘professor, and not ‘doctor.’ In the
East, at social gathering, ‘Mr.’ is the most common form of
introduction for a professor, it being thought convenient not
to confuse the other guests by a misleading mention of
‘doctor.’

“In small, run-of-the-mill colleges it is likely that pro-
fessors are plentiful and doctors (Ph.D.’s) rare; so it often
happens that the title of doctor is made much of—in print
and in speech.”

Two Attend RPI Conference

 

Sandler Recommends EC Join V.A.S.G.

By STEVE SANDLER
Sophomore
Executive Committteeman

The Virginia Association of Stu-
dent Governments is an organization
of twenty-three colleges and universi-
ties in the state of Virginia, Its pur-
pose is to bring together the various
ideas and problems of the members
such that each school is in some way
aided.

On November 15, Danny Leonard
and I attended the VASG Fall Con-
ference at the Richmond Professional
Institute. We were invited to this con-

|ference so that we could view the
| workings of the association in hopes
| that Washington and Lee join.

Need for Communication

At the luncheon Lt. Governor
Fred Pollard summed up the im-
portance of VASG, stating, “as col-
|leges in Virginia continue to grow,
| there is a greater need for communi-
|cation among them.” VASG would
be the means by which W&L could
take advantage of this communica-
tion.

The VASG is not associated with
the National Student Association.
The organization does not have a

 

 

 

national political affiliation or stand,
nor are there indications that such
a stand will be adopted.

Twelve Committees

There are twelve standing commit-
tees which meet at each of the four
conferences held each year. Some of
these committees are self-explanatory,
while others may require elucidation:

Editors Committee—composite and
exchange of means and procedures
aimed at improvement of college and
university newspapers.

Student-Teacher Evaluation Com-
mittee.

Honor Court Committee—we can

New Magazines Are Only Fair To Poor

By RON KESSLER

The Ring-tum Phi receives weekly
a preponderance of letters from vari-
ous sources requesting free publicity
for everything from trips to Tahiti
to spot announcements about tele-
vision shows sponsored by “that with-
it company, Pepsi.”

Last week, we received a copy of
Cheetah Magazine, and a letter sug-
gesting that we review it because
“Cheetah is the only magazine on
the stands which is edited by people
who know what's really happening.”
We now know that “what's really
happening” is that the whole world
is full of smiling, rich, exuberant
teeny-boppers of all ages.

Muddling through the rest of our
mail, we found Moderator, which we
receive since we are leading students,
and Moderator is “the national maga-
zine for leading students” (addressed:
MAN RING-TUM BUS).

Finally we find Avant Garde, sent
to us not because we are anything,
but because we sent them five bucks
Avant Garde is Ralph Ginzbureg’s
newest entrepreneurial endeavor, fol-
lowing Eros (Resting In Peace due
to a Federal Court decision), and Fact
(presumably and hopefully Resting
In Peace due to the Fact that it was
lousy). Avant Garde claims itself to
dedicated to the

future.”

Moderator has established itself a

» serious student magazine. It was
st one time distributed gratia to any
mal iudent who washed for it, bu |

it now is available for $3.00 per
year, except to “qualified male stu-
dents” who still receive it without
charge.

Editorial policy is expounded
thoughout the magazine, and is lib-
eral, supporting draft reform (volun-
tary), et. al. In its November issue,
| Moderator lists members of the Stu-
jdent Establishment, subheaded New
| Left (Bertrand Russell, Ho Chi Minh),
| Student Power (no southern college
|is represented), Student Press (Ring-
}tum Phi is ommitted (!), UNC Tar-
heel and Daily Texan are included),
On The Right (Moise Tshombe, Barry
Goldwater), and Hippies with campus

impact (Allen Ginsberg, Timothy
Leary).
Moderator awards a monthly

GLOF (General Lack of Fiber) award.
In November, this award went to
the College News Bureau which
“issues a news release to immortalize
what would otherwise be all too
mortal,”

AVANT GARDE

Ihe background to Avant Garde
is more interesting than most of the
articles in its first issue. Several years
ago, Ralph Ginzburg put out a maga-
zine called Eros, a publication en-
| titled “The Housewife’s Handbook
on Selective Promiscuity,” and the
newsletter “Liaison.” These were dis-
| tributed through the U.S. mails. Eros
was designed to “deal joyously with
the subjects of love and sex.” Evi-
dently, a Federal Court in Phila-
delphia did not enjoy Eres; Ginzburg
was convicted in 1963 for mailing

obscene literature.

While fighting this conviction in
higher courts (his conviction was up-
held by the Supreme Court in 1966),
Ginzburg published Fact, an absurd,
boring, and poorly edited expose
magazine, which we have not seen
recently, and which we presume no
longer exists,

Several months ago, advertisements
appeared in various publications
across the country in which a pro-
vocalive young woman expounded
“a proposition,” i.¢., a subscription
to “the most exciting and beautiful
new magazine in the country” for
just half price, and the right to
renew forever (which may not be
very long if Ginzburg’s luck holds
out) at that price.

So, we subscribed (the editorial
“we” meaning “me,” not the R-t P).
Issue number one features a scurril-
ous Faet-like article on Richard
Nixon, illustrated with caricatures of
Nixon in the form of a barker, devil,
Abe Lincoln on stilts, hawk, and
dunce. Ht asserts that he is “dumb

. tasteless . . . has little integrity

. & hypocrite [and] is intemperate”
among other euphemisms

Next is “The Hate Mail of Captain
Levy.” This is simply a publication
of the letters written to Army Captain
Howard Levy, now in prison for re-
fusing to teach Vietnam-destined
“Green Berets.” Many of the letters
are incredibly repulsive, obviously
written by some incredibly repulsive
human beings. In spite of the fact
that you know these kind of people

How The R.O.T.C.
Will Win The War

By BERNIE FELD

(Washington and Lee is fortunate
this year to have distinguished visit-
ing lecturer in military science Brig.
Gen. Lucius B. McPhite, who is cur-
rently on leave from a small liberal
arts college nestled in the foothills of
the Mekong Delta about 150 miles
southeast of Saigon. The following
is a transcript of an interview with
Gen. McPhite.)

R-t Phi: Gen. McPhite, what is
your opinion of war?

MePhite: I'm for
it, son,

R-t Phi: Is that
your feeling on
Vietnam, also?

McPhite: That's
a war, isn’t it?

R-+t Phi: Yes, |
guess it is. But
what about the
statement that
some people make
that the army's job Feld
is to keep the
peace, do you agree with that?

McPhite: You betcha. And if we
don't go over there to Vietnam and
fight with those Krauts—excuse me,
Chinks—how the hell can we expect
to keep the peace?

R-t Phi: Hm, | hadn't thought of
it like that.

McPhite: Besides that, the war's
going to be over soon

R-t Phi: How do you know that?

MecPhite: Gen. Westeybrook says
that after that last battle the V¢
can't hold out much longer

R-+t Phi: Yes, but do you think he's
in & position to know? After all he
was in Washington, D. C., when that
battle was fought,

McPhite: Of course he was Do
you think anyone in his right mind
would be over there?

R-t Phi: Well it's good to know that
whoever's running that war is sane

(Suddenly shouts from the next
room: Come on, Wimperly, KILL!
KILL! You get a C plus, Wimp
erly, you didn't do your homework.)

R-t Phi: Say, what's that in there”?

MecPhite: That's one of our study
rooms, We like to call it the leader
ship laboratory

R4 Phi: That's understandable
What kind of courses do you have?

MecPhite: First there's the survey
course, Maim 101 and Kill 102~it's
linked. We have a course on self
defeme—How To Wipe Out an
Enemy Brigade with a Mess Kit: a
survival course on how to tell a good
Vietnamese from a bad Vietnamese
Shoot First and Ask Questions Later
and a course on military protocol
How To Polish Brass Buttons With

By Thunder Thornton
Sports Writer

Tucked insignificantly in a
corner of the basement of
Doremus Gym, next to the
equipment and laundry rooms,
is the office of Coach Verne
Canfield and his right hand
man, Coach Tom Davies. Odd
place for the man who guided
his charges to a 20-5 record
last winter, you say? Unfortu-
nately for General opponents, oceania
pre-season reports hint that Coach Canfield spends his only
time in the depths while he is in his office.

The Big Blue Basketball forces should be top rate. Co-
captains Rob Bauer and Jody Kline will head a veteran team
into a beefed-up schedule, but conversation around Lexington
seems to indicate that the concensus supports an approxima-
tion of last year’s fine record.

When interviewed, Coach Canfield said that any changes
in the offense and defense would be slight. He said that the
Generals attack would perhaps be more simplified than last
year, but would still feature the 1-3-1 setup.

 

Guard
Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.

On defense, the Generals will stick with the man-to-man
and match-up alignments. Coach Canfield warned that his boys
could be expected to press on defense in an effort to control
the tempo. The veteran coach said that he expects to see lots
of zone defenses and full court presses to slow down his team’s
free-wheeling attack.

Out to Get The Generals

Pre-season workouts have stressed the execution of funda-
mentals, this week especially in the outside shooting depart-
ment. Coach Canfield listed a number of things that would
be important in every game. First of all, the Generals must
play their own game, which, as last year’s fans will remember,
included both a disciplined offense and defense and a running
attack when the opportunity was presented. More of the same
is to be expected this year. The threat of the fast break will
be present but “the good percentage shot will be the key” to
Washington and Lee’s offense. Control of both the offensive
and defensive boards will be a must. Coach Canfield looks for
more low-scoring games this season and will be ready for any-
thing and everything as most opponents will be “out to get
WéeL.”

The Generals most definitely have the personnel to put
all this theory into practice. Number One on everybody’s list
must be Mel Cartwright, last year’s All-Everything. Mel, a
6-6 sophomore from Martinsville, Va., led the team in nearly
every category, and did not limit himself to offensive heroics.
He was a sturdy defender and rugged rebounder, as well as
prolific scorer. His 20.1 scoring average was a key factor in
the hardcourt renaissance at Washington and Lee.

But the Big Blue will be far from a one-ring circus this
winter. Lending able help both as a scorer and rebounder
will be another sophomore, 6-6 Mal Wesselink. An all-CAC
selection like Cartwright, “Mean Mal’’ teams effectively with
“Magic Mel” in the forecourt.

Other team members to watch are numerous. Transfer
student Mike Neer, a 6-7 sophomore who high jumps nearly
as high as he stands, will be just that much more dynamite
for opponents to handle. Guard John Carrere combines speed
with his excellent outside shooting to pose a potent threat
whether the Generals are running or setting up patterns.

Of course, the “old-timers” will be of great importance.
Jody Kline, Rob Bauer, and Earl Edwards will be around to
steady the youngsters and display their own considerable tal-

Season Opens Tonight

ents. Bauer, if healthy, will be seeking to regain the All-State
ranking he held as a freshman.

The Generals’ bench could be the best around and you
can bet that such names as Fauber, Morrison, Stone, and
Rhyne will appear in the lineup often throughout the season.
All but Rhyne, who is a freshman from Marianna, Florida,
saw considerable action last year and fans will remember Nor-
wood’s dead-eye jumpers, Stu’s hustle on the boards, and
Charlie’s all-around floor play. Coach Canfield will lose
nothing talent-wise when he looks for a substitute.

Injuries For Opener

In fact, in looking toward tonight’s opener at Bridgewater,
the coach reported that of the ten boys who will dress, “every-
body could start.” There will be some question marks due to
injuries, however. Carrere is out with a sprained ankle and
Bauer has an injured hand which makes his status questionable.
This makes the tentative lineup include the three big boys
Neer, Cartwright, and Wesselink, along with either Stone or
Morrison, with captain Jody Kline on the point.

In the Eagles, who split a two-game series with W&L last
year, the Generals will find no pushover. Canfield has de-
scribed them as “pesky,” and their two stars Jim Upperman
at 6-4 and Eddie Cook, a 6-1 outside threat, could produce
the upset. In fact, these two helped get the Generals off on
the wrong foot last year when Brigewater defeated the home
team in the Doremus opener 83-71. But the Generals have
come a long way since then.

Tonight will also mark the opening of the J-V season.
The preliminary will send W&L’s junior varsity into action
at 6:00. The rest of the varsity season will be highlighted
by the Randolph-Macon tournament, featuring Lycoming,
Pa., W&L, Maryville, Tenn., and the host Jackets. A big game
for the Generals will be the struggle with Southern Conference
member East Carolina. And of course Washington and Lee
will want to defend its CAC basketball championship at the
season’s end. These games will be featured on the radio, but
students shouldn’t miss the “live” performances. Maybe Coach
Canfield moved downstairs to avoid the limelight. There should
be a lot of it this season.

Opening a basketball season on the

a rigged game of Russian Roulette.
Enthusiasm for a season opener at

and more noise. For the unfortunate
visitors, added attractions may in-

opener for both teams. Later in the
season, WAL edged Bridgewater 64-
62 on the Eagles’ hardwood. Bridge-
water, like any other team, will re-
member that loss (and if the players
don't, the coaches will be sure to
remind them), and will be doing its
best to use its home advantage.
While the home-court edge is a
natural phenomenon throughout bas-
ketball, it is generally acknowledged
that some gymnasiums are “edgeier”
than others. A_ classic example is
Witchita’s famed “Snake Pit,” terror
of of the Missouri Valley Conference.
While Bridgewater is no Witchita and
Bridgewater Gymnasium is no “Snake
Pit,” the Eagles do possess an ample
supply of boisterous fans who would
like nothing better than to see their
team start the year with an upset
over WAL, and will not be above
using their lungpower to help bring
this about. Besides this, there are the

 

twin factors of revenge (last year's
i loss and this year’s football Home-
lcoming defeat) and the not-to-be-
| forgotien fact that a “rich boy-poor
| boy” rivalry does exist between the
| schools, at least in the minds of
loyal Bridgewaterians.

If the committee sees this complaint
valid, it is taken to the whole mem-

A complaint expressed by a couple

uses a “freeze-out” to keep certain
people out. This consists of the mem-

bers’ completely ignoring someone
they do not like and making him
feel unwanted. This fact was un-

Yearbook To

Real WGL Fraternity Life

“A yearbook should reflect
spirit of the institution which pub-
lishes it.” With this philosophy in
mind, Peter Strohm, editor of the
Calyx, plans to issue an annual which
will be different in many ways from
past Washington and Lee yearbooks.

With the help of Farris P.
Hotchkiss, associate director of Uni-
versity development at W&L and past
editor of the Calyx, Strohm has in-
corporated many new ideas into the
next yearbook.

One of the most notable changes
will be in the fraternity section of
the Calyx. In the past there has been

Next Semester

In actions yesterday afternoon, the

troduction of physical chemistry.

New Psych Course

A new course in psychological
statistics will be offered next Spring.

States. Also the sociology depart-
ment will teach a new course on the

one large group picture for each fra-
ternity and a brief descriptive article
about the fraternity. In this year’s
annual, however, each fraternity will
have four pictures—one for each
class. The short descriptive story will
be kept, however, and informal pic-
tures of fraternity activities will also
be included.

By using these pictures, Strohm
hopes to show some of the inform-
ality of fraternity life. In these pic-
tures “each person will stand out as
an individual rather than a face in
a sea of faces.”

Some other differences in the year-
book will be in the presentation of
school organizations and the faculty.
Each university organization will have
one large picture of its members, as
was done in past annuals. This year,
however, there will also be some in-
formal shots of each group. These
pictures will hopefully give some idea
of what the organization is like, some-
thing the mass pictures cannot do.

The changes in the faculty section
of the yearbook will result in more
pages with fewer large group pic-
tures than in the other annuals. In-
siead, there will be more pictures of
small groups. The English depart-
ment, for example, will not be crowd-
ed into one picture, but instead will
be shown in several pictures.

Strohm emphasized the fact that
yearbooks are read not only by stu-

Student Affairs Committee
Changes Penalty Decisions

The Student Affairs Committee at
its meeting of November 29, 1967
voted to increase the penalties given
by the Student Control Committee
to the two students involved in setting
fire to fraternity Homecomings dis-
plays.

The student who set fire to the
Lambda Chi Alpha display will be
on complete social probation from
November 27 until June 7, 1968, The
SCC had put him on social probation
until January 19 with a subsequent
term of conduct probation

dicated that it would treat any
further instances involving fire as a

ability at present to offer only “com-
munication between student leaders,”
“experience from others’ problems”
and a possible collective barganing
advantage in signing entertainers,
membership would be in effect re-
quire W&L to give far more than it
could receive.

Possibly ranked high on the list
of things W&L would give to the
VASG, Nash said, was the prestige
lent VASG by the University’s name.
About 25 of Virginia’s 49 colleges
have joined.

Last night’s vote came on a motion
by senior Jody Kline to reject mem-
bership with the understanding the
matter would be reconsidered at a
later date when the organization be-
gins to acquire specific direction.

Nash announced the faculty's
Courses and Degrees Committee con-
sidered the EC’s mid-semester test
reform proposal but did not vote on
it—and Nash reported C-&-D Com-
mittee chairman Dean William J. Watt
is not optimistic on a favorable dis-
position of the EC petition.

Nash quoted Dean Watt's reasons:
It is felt to be undesirable to
discourage administrative mid-term
grades “more than they are already
discouraged,” with the _ significant
exception of perhaps allowing the
option of using simple “P” for pass
and “F” for failure at mid-term.

The prospect of a mid-term “exam
period,” designed to avoid jamming
a number of tests into a couple of
days, but in effect requiring all pro-
fessors to give mid-term tests where
many now do not, was not received
favorably.

Discontentment of the Day

7 7 7 7 7 r

OUR OWN BEHEMOTH

We were going to write a vitriol-filled editorial this week
on the noxious, outrageous, oppressive, malignant bureaucracy
in our rural, rustic little college—but we read an article the
other day that took some of the wind out of our sails. The
story told of a group at the University of Maryland that wanted
to circulate a newsletter on campus, and to do so was required
to petition—get this—the “executive director of the office of
the Executive Dean for Student Life.” (And he turned down
the group’s request.)

Somebody once bothered to figure out that Washington
and Lee has more committees and administrative sub-bodies
per capita than the entire federal government. Simply chang-
ing a course requires the approval of a very, very large number
of exceedingly hard-to-locate people: various faculty advisors,
sundry departmental chairmen, one or more deans, and in-
evitably, a fee-collector in the registrar’s office (all roads led
to the registrar’s office). Changing one’s major, especially
into or out of the Commerce School, is an experience of in-
expressible wretchedness, vilely complicated for the student
who has a double major, one inside and one outside Com-
merce. There is absolutely no communication, not to mention
even the barest coordination, between the committee that
decides whether or not to give students who request it an extra
day of absences before or after a vacation. and the committee
that passes judgement on students who take extra cuts without
the first committee’s approval.

We don’t mean to belittle the work of the faculty commit-
tee members; any belittling is done by the anachronistic pro-
cedures of most of the committees, and the fundamental func-
tions of a couple of the others. The Committee on Courses
and Degrees, one of the whistle-stops on the tour of a change-
of-major request, is so wound up in red tape that it generally
has to meet weekly to keep up. Approval of a change-of-major
is automatic on the part of the committee; the petitioning stu-
dent doesn’t even have to give a reason (which is one of the
few aspects of committee procedure that ought to be left
alone). It is not strictly proper, we think, to require two deans,
one administrator and six professors to take substantial time
for their other activities this often for that purpose. And the
C-&-D Committee is not at all alone here.

But still, things aren’t impossible. One can, if he puts his
mind to it, track down the necessary endorsers for a course
change in one or two days. It takes somewhat longer for a
change in major, but that’s all right, too. Please, though just
keep us from the day when we have to register the Ring-tum
Phi with the executive director of the office of the Executive
Dean for Student Life, and we'll be happy enough.

AND A LITTLE CONTENTMENT

We find last night’s vote by the student Executive Com-
mittee overwhelmingly rejecting membership in the Virginia
Association of Student Governments—which wanted us to
associate with and lend our school’s good name to a non-
selective collection of motley Virginia colleges including the
very dregs of Commonwealth education but not the best,
without recompense or benefit of any sort to us, and with no
control over what the V. A. S. G. would attach to our name—
a most satisfying decision.

Early Ring-tum Phi Met Criticism
For Printing “Scandalous Verse”

Back in the days when telephones
(all 68 of them in Lexington, an
advertisement boasted) were known
as “up-to-date electric call bells,”
back when stealing a bell-clapper was
called “a naughty-one’s frolic,” in the
same year that the New York Post
conferred on this city (really) the
title “Athens of the South’—there
came into being a little newspaper,
published weekly “by the students,
for the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity community,” and named after the
most popular of that University’s foot-
ball cheers: “Ring-tum Phi.”

The Collegian had this to say of
the Ring-tum Phi:

“Coincident with the administra-
tion of President Wilson begins the
career of a new publication at
Washington and Lee, the Ring-tum

Phi. The Ring-tum Phi is a weekly
journal and presents a pleasing ap-
pearance. It meets a distinct need in
the University and relieves the Col-
legian of what formerly has tended
only to clog and retard.
Literary Magazine

“The Collegian is primarily a
literary magazine, and when the
editors heretofore were forced to
cram in a_ limitless number of
locals, they always bewailed the
dismal incongruity. Henceforth, we
rejoice to say, the Collegian is
freed from matters of this kind,
and will not be compelled to try to
serve two ends at once...

“Gentlemen of the Ring-tum Phi,
you have our best wishes. Gentle-
men of the Ring-tum Phi, we give
you our sincerest thanks. Students
of W. and L., we congratulate you
on the advent of the long needed
weekly!”

The year was 1897, The Southern
Collegian was still a high-quality
magazine, being published by the Gra-
ham Literary Society. The Ring-tum
Phi was designed to be a somewhat
lighter, perhaps even ribald, comple-
ment to the Collegian, (Curious, how
the two publications’ positions of re-
spectability have made a pair of 180-
degree turns... .)

Eighteen and ninety-seven. The year
the football coach had to send away
for a special noseguard “to protect
the colossal proboscis which acom-
panies Mr. Fitzhugh’s countenance.”
(“Mr.” Fitzhugh was a student; every-
body then was Mister or Doctor or
Professor of Reverend.)

Scandalous Verse

Eighteen and ninety-seven. The year
of the Great H--] Scandal. It seems
the very first editor-in-chief, George
Houston, in he fourth issue of the
neophyte newspaper, published a
column of “Foot-Ball Songs,” one of
which concluded with this verse:

“Each other's back, boys,

“Has got a knack, boys,

“For making gains, sit,

“Round the end.

“And it’s a sin, sif,

“For Oberlin [a WAL player], sir,

“Then join the yell, boys,

“And yell like h--l, boys,

“Sure enough.

Volume I, Number 1

writer (we told you things haven't
changed much) said:

“There appeared in the columns
of the Ring-tum Phi, last week,
a song which, to the thoughtful
person had very little to recom-
mend it.... The only thing that I
can see that would have recom-
mended it to the editorial eye is
the little smack of naughtiness
which makes the first rhyme in the
last verse.

“The Editor seems to be filled
with pride to even know the au-
thor; he puts the verse in the first
column of his newspaper, and
writes an editorial commending it
as ‘especially good.’ He says the
words tire the voice very little.

“Now everyone, who knows
anything of the subject, knows that
the sound of that ‘h’ has a very
rasping effect on the vocal chords.
How much better it would have
been had the line read: ‘And yell
right well, boys.” It would have
sounded better, been easier on the
voice, and would have saved the
writer and Editor from showing
off their weakness.

“It can be admitted that, to some
eyes, there is something worthy
of admiration in a dark, purple
crime, but to bow before a sinlet
like this is weakness personified.

“In the future let me suggest
that the Editor follow the path of
virtue. He will not only find it
pleasant, but may keep himself
from showing his lack of taste,

City’s Christmas

Parade Heralds
Holiday Season

Lexington opened the Christmas
season for its 8,500 inhabitants last
Friday night, with one of the biggest
parades for a city of its size.

The parade drew as many as 20,000
who lined Main Street from Tetlow’s
down to the Court House to watch
over 30 locally-built floats.

There were floats from most of the
businesses in Lexington, as well as
from high school, church and civic

groups. Santa Claus rode on they

Jaycee float.

There can be no value judgments
as far as the comparative quality of
the floats is concerned, except to
say that all were as well done as in
most big city parades. But the longest
float was that of an instrumental
group from Buena Vista, who _ had
two flatbed trailers, half of the
group on each,

Any parade would be incomplete
without girls, and Lexington’s
Christmas parade certainly had its
share. There were several groups
of majorettes, and most notably seven
area representatives.

These included Miss Rockbridge
(Miss Jean Ann Sheridan of South-
ern Seminary), and six girls from
other local schools.

Lexington Mayor and W&L’s sup-
erintendent of buildings and grounds
D. E. Brady was parade marshal
along with Charles W. Gunn, Jr.,
of the State Legislature.

This year Lexington’s downtown
area is more decorated than ever.
Lights were strung over the streets,
and as last year, there are whiie
candles in most of the windowg in
the area.

The Christmas tree in the Court-
house Square was first used last De-
cember, and is being lit again this
year with white lights.

Many of the bands, floats, ma-
jorettes, and assorted marchers were
from areas outside of Lexington—
Staunton, Clifton Forge, Roanoke,
Covington, Natural Bridge and Lynch-
burg. The Lexington Christmas
parade has grown each year to date
and is one of the best-known of its
kind in Virginia.

Chaffin, whe coaches the WAL de

Already WAL debate teams have

captured top awards this year al the

The debate team maintained a win

which 18 to 40 people were in

Roundballers Win Opening Test
Face R.P.I. In Doremus Tonight

Friday night the Generals opened |
the 1967-68 season with an impressive
win over a_ stubborn Bridgewater |
team. Mel Cartwright led the Gen-
eral’s scoring with 27 but game honors
were captured by Jim Upperman of
Bridgewater who had 29. The Gen-
erals were without the services of |
point John Carrere who missed his
first game in his career at W&L; Nor-

 

wood Morrison started in his place
and did an admirable job. The Gen-
eral’s bench strength was made evi-
dent as Coach Canfield continually
rotated his “big men” giving each a
short rest throughout the game. It
was this bench strength that eventu-
ally proved too much for the Eagles.

The Generals grabbed the lead
after a few minutes of the first half

 

Player of

 

the Week

Rob Bauer

With only one game to judge
performances by this week's choice
for “Player of the Week” was a
difficult task. Outstanding candi-
dates were Mel Cartwright, Stu
Fauber and Rob Bauer. However,
because of his performance at a
critical point in Friday’s game,
this week’s choice is Rob Bauer.

Rob is a junior from Largo,
Fla., and is in his thired year on
the varsity. Although he didn't
see extensive action last year,
year before last he was a standout,
leading the team in scoring with a
15.4 average. He also held the
record in about every other de-
partment. Last year Rob was hob-
bled with a knee injury but an
operation last spring has seem-
ingly left him in fine shape.

In Friday night’s game against
Bridgewater Bauer scored 10
points in the crucial closing stages
of the second half and did a good
job of keeping Jim Upperman
from getting the ball. It is with
a great deal of pride that the Tues-
day Edition cites Rob Bauer for
his outstanding contribution in
Friday's game.

Grapplers Win Fri.;
Lose Saturday

By MARK BROMLEY

Washington and Lee's wrestling
team opened its season this past
weekend and achieved a record of

one win and one loss. On Friday,
the first event matched the Generals
against Gallaudet College of Wash-
ington. The result was a 28-8 victory.
The next day, the team suffered its
first defeat at the hands of Towson
State. The score was 26-11.

Standouts of the wekend matches
included Dan Webster (177 Ibs.) and
Jay Clark (191 Ibs), who scored the
only double victories for W&L.

The team, led by co-captains Bob

Payne and Don O'Hare, is com-
posed of ten members. They include:
Razz Rasberry, Whitney Morrill,

with Fauber, Morrison, and Cart-
wright wielding hot hands in the point
department. However, as the half
came to a close Bridgewater managed
to tie the score at 42 all. The second
half started off poorly for the Gen-
erals with Upperman pouring in
point after point. The Generals man-
aged to keep up only because of the
fancy shooting of Mel Cartwright.
At one point the Generals were down
by 7 points. It was at this point that
Rob Bauer entered the game and
began a superb job of defense on
Upperman. He guarded Upperman
so well that he seldom got the ball
and when he did he had to force his
shot and his shooting percentage fell
way off. Bauer didn’t stop with just
defense as he contributed four field
goals and two foul shots to help the
Generals regain the lead that they
never again lost. Rob played in a
manner reminiscent of his freshman
year when he was All State. Though
it is doubtful that he will get too
many starting assignments this year
his role will be a major one if he
continues to play in such a manner.

Coach Canfield called the game a
“fine effort” on the part of all the
players and said that the mistakes
made were easily correctable before
the next game. He also added that
the team shouldn't be too dependent
on the fine outside shooting that was
present Friday night but that they

‘will have to be prepared to work the
| ball into one of the big men under-

Rifle Teams Wins in D.C.

The Washington and Lee Rifle
Team won its first match of the sea-
son on Friday night against George
Washington University. The contest
was extremely close but ended with
Washington and Lee in front 1191-
1203. This difference in score amount-
ed to just over one well placed shot
of the 300 rounds fired by each team.

Sgt. Fields, coach of the rifle team,
(known to every ROTC student on the
drill field), attributed the victory to
a strong team effort. He acknowl-
edged that the George Washington

riflemen had shot a fine match.

Hugh B. (for bullseye) Guill, soph-
more from Washington, D. C., had
the leading score of 257.

he rifle team has been practicing
for a month, two or three times a
week, at the VMI indoor range where
the contest was held.

Swimmers Lose

The Generals’ swimming team lost
a close contest to American Univer-
sity by the score of 57 to 47. The
meet was still in doubt until Amer-
ican managed to squeak by with a
slim victory in the last event.

Coach Stearns’ swimmers all
formed to the best of their ability
in the season’s first meet. Billy Ball,
Pat Costello, Dave Kympton, and
Ross Forman combined to win the
opening 400 yard medley relay with
a time of 3:56.8.

The Generals next first came with
the one-two punch of co-captain Noel
Clinard and Mike Carrere in the
diving scoring 176 and 167 points
respectively. Bill Brumback continued
his blistering pace by winning the
100 yard freestyle with a time of
51.3 which bettered the team rec-
Parker Moore.

Billy Ball scored again winning the
200 yard backstroke for the Gener
als with a time of 2:18.2; Ball also

Tuesday, p.m.

By RIC BERARD

Over the past weekend, one of
Washington and Lee’s least discussed
but, percentage-
wise, most success-
ful teams lost their
season Opener to
American Univer-
sity, 57-47. Natu-
rally, | am refer-
ring to that often
ignored paragon
of athletic prowess
at W&L, the swim-
ming team, which,
to the disbelief of
many, possesses a
gaudy 171-81-1 cumulative record.
Coached for only the second year by
Bill Stearns, the Generals want to
equal or better their 6-3 record of
last season.

Building Year

However, this year appears to be a
building year for Stearns and his
young squad. (There are only two
seniors on the team.) In discussing
this season’s prospects, Coach Stearns
suggested that “Individually, this team
has a great deal of talent, and many
school records will fall. However, |
am going to wait and see about the
team record, although all of us antici-
pate a winning season.” And, in terms
of last Saturday, the coach seems to
have hit the nail on the head.

With respect to the team’s overall
performance, Stearns was principally
referring to opponents such as West

varsity squads, Yet, led by co-captains

 

there is no dearth of talent.

With Clinard diving and Billy Ball,
Bill Kimmel, Ross Forman, Scott Me-
Elroy and Dave Kympton swimming,
the Generals are in possession of some
excellent talent, in addition to a Phi

Delt quorum. But the strength of this
team is going to be found among the
freshmen. In addition to frosh Mike
Carrere and Hal Catlin, there has
emerged Doremus’ first indigenous
aquatic, a Mr. Bill Brumback, who it
is claimed needs only to be placed
into the water in order to break a
record. (In preseason trials, he only
broke five school marks.)

Bright Future

So, in spite of the General’s tough

loss to American U., the season

isn’t over yet. If Coach Stearns can

ceptionally bright. But it’s not just
talent that distinguishes Stearns and
his team. For in watching the prac-
tices, they can easily be confused with
the “tall ones” upstairs in terms of
desire and spirit. And since a little
hard-earned self-pride never hurt any
team, you hafta like the odds on ’em,
particularly as they combine their
personal desire, respect for Stearns
and their own unquestioned talents in
forming a team effort and morale.

It's unfortunate that only three
home meets are scheduled this season
although we readily concede that we
do possess a huge home advantage
with our special 2342 yard long pool.
(After all, it’s pretty frightening to
those of us at W&L, too.) Luckily
though, the next meet will be here,
on Saturday of this week. If you want
to see some outstanding swimming,
the team will be competing against
Gettysburg at 1:00.

Co-Captains:
Wolf,

MacKenzie

Juniors John Wolf and Scott Mac-
kenzie have been selected Washing-
ton and Lee University football co-
captains for the 1968 season.

Wolf, the Generals’ candidate for
Little All-Aemica honors this fall,
finished the nine-game campaign with
78 tackles and 56 assists from his out-
side linebacker spot, while Macken-
zie, W&L’s defensive left end, rank-
ed as the Generals’ most improved
layer during the year.

“We think the team has selected
two fine young men,” said W&L head
coach Lee McLaughlin. “Both players
are outstanding football performers
and their leadershi ability has been
demonstrated both on and off the
field.”

It is the first time in four years
that the Generals have gone with co-
captains from the same unit.

W&L’s Missing Mace

Asked about the whereabouts of
the mace, Mr. Coleman, the university
librarian, replied: “I don’t know . .
it's one of the University’s mysteries.”
Dr. Starling, University Marshall,
who carries the mace at the head of
university processions, also said that
he knew nothing about the where-
abouts of the mace.

The mace is under the custody of
Mr. Douglas E. Brady, Director of
Buildings and Grounds and Mayor of

by the advice of Mr. Hotchkiss,
Strohm believes that this annual will

about W&L. He hopes that in it he
can “capture the spirit of the Uni-

Professor Chaffin feels that W&L
has high quality students who be-
come interested in debate and are
willing to work at it. This too is a
reason for the team’s great successes.

“Silver-Collecting”

Leading the silver-collecting is the
two-man team of Tommy M. Bare-
more, a senior from Shreveport, La.,
and Christopher H. Mills of Denver,
Colo. Not far behind are senior Hal
Higginbotham of Shreveport, A. M.
(Rusty) Meyer, Jr., another senior,
and freshman R. Timothy Wright,
both of Houston.

Mills and Baremore won the UNC
meet with a 7-1 record, reached the
semifinals at Emory before bowing
with a 9-2 mark, and went to 46-0
last weekend to capture the meet at
UVa.

In addition, Wright won the firs*
place affirmative award, Meyer was
second, Mills was second on the
negative side and Baremore was
third. In extemporaneous speaking,
Baremore was first and Meyer second.

In previous years Mills and Bare-
more have won numerous other de-

.| bate trophies, either teamed together

or with others. “They have accumu-
lated more awards than any other two
debaters we've ever had,” notes
Chaffin.

Tonight the Generals take on R.P.I.
in their home debut, Last year the
Generals won by a score of 89-84
with Lyn Creech scoring 24 points
for the Rams. However, this year
they will be without the services of
Creech who encountered academic
difficulties last semester and is in-
eligible for play. R.P.I. won't be a
push over though, as they have a
couple of big boys who can jump
as high as the sky.

This weekend the Generals journey
to Ashland to participate in the Ran-
dolph-Macon Christmas Tournament.
Their opposition consists of Macon,
Lycoming and Maryville.

a clarification of freshman class

President, Luke Crosland).

In past years the Fancy Dress Cock-

provided by the LF.C. Last
year, however, the LF.C. decided not
to sponsor this affair so that they

either the President of Fancy Dress

that he find some other source of

Va. Association of Student Gov’ts

Nash: Aims Are Too Vague

By RICHARD NASH
Student Body President

| have been asked by the Friday
Ring-tum Phi to summarize the rea-
sons that prompt-
ed the Executive
Committee to re-
ject membership
to the Virginia
Association of Stu-
dent Governments
by a vote of seven
to one at last Mon-
day’s weekly meet-
ing. According to
the discussion that
took place, the
following points
seemed to be the decisive ones in de-
termining the committee’s decision:

1, VASG has been in existence
for less than a year. Because it is
a newly formed organization,
VASG’s policies and directional
aims are still broad, vague, and
ill-defined. Just where it is headed
and what it intends to accomplish
is unknown to anyone at this time,
and thus, it would not be wise to
“jump in” without finding out more
about the organization,

2. At the present, as any student
organization would, VASG runs the
risk of becoming a “politically ori-
ented” group. This is what happened
to the National Student Association
as well as many lesser-known organi-
zations. Washington and Lee has never
desired to become affiliated with such
a group.

3. If at some later date, VASG
should adopt some proposal or policy
that was contradictory or even un-
favorable to Washington and Lee, we
would find ourselves in a position of
having to support it. Also, anyone
who knew of such a policy or pro-
posal would quite possibly know that
Washington and Lee was a member
of the organization supporting it. This
would, of course, not be in our best
interests. It might be argued that
there would probably be a “minority
opinion” list published, but these are
very seldom noticed by most people.

4. We might get into a key leader-
ship position and guide VASG with
out influence. However, it was later
noted that the core of leadership has
already been formed, and that Wash-
ington and Lee might very well be
put in a “follower” type of position.
This, too, would not be in our best
interests,

5. Washington

Nash

Lee is a uni

in common
with of the other universities
and colleges in Virginia. Thus, the
consensus seems to be that we would
no doubt gain “very little’ from such
an association with them

6. Probably the single most ap-
pealing reason for membership in
VASG would be the communications
established with the student leaders
of other schools. Much correspend-
ence takes place between student gov-
ernment leaders of schools, and know-

ing names and faces facilitates cor-
respondence. However, Washington
and Lee sends delegates to several
conferences composed of Virginia
schools, and ample time for meeting
and getting to know leaders from
other schools is provided for at these
meetings.

All in all, Washington and Lee’s
membership in VASG would prob-
ably not hurt us. But there is al-
ways the slight chance that it would.
It may be trite to say that “we'd
rather be safe than sorry,” but that
is exactly how we feel.

At the present the disadvantages
appear to far outweigh the advantages
of our joining the Virginia Associa-
tion of Student Governments. How-
ever, should the organization, at a
later date, prove to be of potential
value and service to Washington and
Lee, we will always have the option
of joining then. Right now, that po-
tential value and service is not able
to be seen, and the Executive Com-
mittee has thus chosen not to affiliate.

The VASG Problem

On Monday evening the Executive Committee voted seven
to one to reject membership for W&L in the Virginia Associa-
tion of Student Governments (VASG).

Obviously, the EC acted in good faith in adopting a cauti-
ous, “wait-and-see”’ attitude. We doubt, however, that they
were prepared for the objections which were raised by a signi-
ficant number of students who feel that W&L may be caryying

its isolationism too far.

However sound the reasons behind the EC’s action may
be, we feel that the issue should by no means be considered
closed. Consequently, we have arranged to have on this page
two contrasting opinions which we hope will allow students to
make some sort of judgment of their own.

Neither writer necessarily represents the editorial opinion

of this newspaper.

 

 

Graham-Lee vs. Washington

 

150 Years of Literary Societies

By MIKE DUNN

We noticed recently that a group
of students has gotten together to
form a literary society. Their idea
is “to replace previous creative writ-
ing associations, either defunct or
presently serving other purposes.”
Reading this, we (1) were surprised
to find out there had been any previ-
ous literary associations at W&L, and
(2) decided to look into the subject.

* a bY

We soon found out that, of all
the activities at W&L, the literary
society holds the record for long-
evity: there has been at least one
around for about 150 of the past
158 years, and for most of that
time there were two.

* * *

The appeal of the literary society
may be lost on most of today’s fra-
ternity-type, down-the-road-on-Satur-
day-night W&L men. But picture
WAL to yourself as it was in 1809:
no cars, no girls and no girls’ schools
to put them in anyway, no flicks, no
tube, no Playboy, no Veemies—jusi
pure, unadulterated intellectualism.

In a situation like that, the only
apparent alternative was a literary
society. On Jan. 19, 1809, about ten
students got together and named them-

selves the Graham Society (later the

Graham Philanthropic Society, and
still later the Graham-Lee Literary
Society). The date was chosen at
random, of course, but later turned
out to be highly symbolic, being
Robert E. Lee's birthday.

Not to be outdone, another eight
students or so got together three
years later and became the Washing-

ton Society (later the Washington
Literary Society).
* * .

The societies used to meet on
Saturday nights. Since there were
only about 20 to 40 students in
the whole college anyway, they

legiate life in Lexington, The Gra-
ham Society was said to be the
more sedate of the two, while the
Washington group attracted the
“gayer class,” but both of them
got less and less literary as time
passed. College officials primly
noted that their literati were as-
sociating with “some of the most
riotous and dissipated youth of the
town,” locking themselves into their
meeting rooms on the third floor
of Washington Hall to drink,
smoke, and play cards until late
in the night.

The result, in 1829, was
first administration-fraternity battle,
as a result of which the two “lit-
erary” societies were forced to sweep
the bottles, cards, and dissipated
young men of the town out of their
meeting rooms and activities.

W&L’'s

* “s

Not that the societies gave up their
social character. In fact, they kept
up a bitter rivalry for new members,
establishing a tradition which later
became Rush Week for the fraterni-
ties. An island in the stream behind
the school became the battleground
for a number of distinctly non-lit-
erary pitched battles between the so-
cieties (until the stream changed
course in 1886 and the custom dis-
appeared with the island).

The societies did, however, begin
paying more attention to their in-
tellectual roles. At first, debate was
the main occupation, and the fervent
scholars of those years discussed such
topics as “Herod was justified in be-
heading John the Baptist” and “The
Louisiana purchase is inexpedient.”

But they also twice voted that no
state had the right to secede from
the Union, and their combined libar-

| ies (3500 books) outnumbered the col-

lege library (2000 books).

wrote a 19th-Century historian.
“Whatever discontent a student may
feel towards the faculty, he rarely
has anything to say against his
society, He feels that it belongs
to the “boys.” He loves it, and
takes pride in it. He is more at
home in its hall than anywhere
else. He enjoys its proceedings. He
labors for its prosperity. He wants
to do his full duty as a member.

And he carries from its associa-
tions pleasant memories that abide
with him through life. In all this
zeal for his society he is getting a
sort of education which he could
get from nothing else, and which is
of the greatest value as a prepara-
tion for active life.”

In 1909 and 1912, on their 100th
anniversaries, both societies were still
going strong, still prestigious and still
valuable training grounds. The Gra-
ham-Lee Society in 1914-15 produced
two men who later became diplomats,
one Virginia supreme court justice,
two educators, two missionaries, a
minister, and five lawyers.

Since the school had gotten very
much bigger, and fraternities were
beginning to make their appearance,
the societies no longer completely
dominated the campus scene; but it
would be a safe estimate to say that
as much as 20 per cent of the student
body belonged to one group or the
other. The annual inter-society debate
was considered so important that it
was held in conjunction with com-
mencement ceremonies in the spring

A typical program in those days
went:

(1) “a short but very appropriate
declamation on Washington and
Lee”

(2) “a beautiful poem rich in
pathos”

(3) “an eloquent oration entitled
‘Our Southern Heritage, ”

(4) debate on enacting a national
income-tax law (the judges decided
in favor of the negative).

Who killed the literary societies?
They began to die in the 30's, when
football made them give up their
Saturday meetings, and renovation
forced them out of their hundred-
year-old meeting halls in Washing-
ton Hall, Automobiles made dates
easier to find, and fraternity parties
and road trips began to draw more
crowds than declamations and ora-
tions. The biggest blow to the so-
cleties was probably sophistication:
“beautiful poems rich in pathos”
began to sound funny about thirty
years ago,

Kessler: Could Not Hurt Us

By RON KESSLER
The recent Executive Committee
action rejecting W&L membership in
the Virginia As-
sociation of Stu-
dent Governments,

and the ‘Tuesday
Edition’s editorial
lauding said act-

ion has once again
shown Washington
and Lee to. the
world as the snot-
tiest of snobs. It
is no secret that
we are regarded
as incredible ego-
maniacs by other schools in the state;
this action has simply solidified this
position.

Evidently, our colleagues on the
Tuesday Edition are thoroughly con-
vinced as to their “stud image;” I
suppose we should be honored that
we are all included in this group,
however we are not so presumptuous,

fo quote the editorial in its en-
tirety is enough to illustrate our point:

“We find last night’s vote by the
Executive Committee overwhelm-
ingly rejecting membership in the
Virginia Association of Student
Governments—which wanted us to
associate with and lend our school’s
good name to a non-selective col-
lection of motley Virginia colleges
including the very dregs of Com-
monwealth education but not the
best, without recompense or bene-

  

Kessler

 

fit of any sort to us, and with no
control over what the V.A.S.G.
would attach to our names—a most |
satisfying decision.”
“Our school’s good name” is be
stowed upon us by our school. W&L
is a damn good school, but surely
not so good that we cannot even
associate with other schools. It is
repulsive to think that we consider
ourselves too good; it is also absurd,
The so-called “non-selective col-
lection of motley Virginia colleges”
includes Hollins, UVa., Sweetbriar,
William and Mary, and VMI. We
doubt that they consider themselves
to be consorting with the “very dregs
of Commonwealth education
without recompense or benefit of any
sort. Even if this were true,
Le., that we would gain nothing at
the present, it could not possibly hurt

 

us to help the organization. But it is
not true. The standing committees to
which we would belong would indu-
bitably aid us.

The possible block billing of big
weekend entertainment would for its
sake alone make it worth joining, It
is altogether conceivable that mem-
ber-schools of VASG would receive
discounts at weekends of other mem-
ber-schools. Our colleagues on the
Tuesday Edition would most gain
from our participation on the Editors
Committee, “aimed at improvement
of college and university newspapers”
(VASG Handbook),

Steve Sandler and Danny Leonard,
Sophomore Executive Committeemen
attended the Fall Conference of the
VASG with the understanding that
they would report to the EC their
findings and make recommendations
concerning membership. Mr. Sandler
was impressed with what he saw, and
recommended to the committee that
W&L join the organization.

Mr. Leonard voted in the majority,
i.@., against joining, stating that it
wouldn't hurt to wait and see how
the organization develops,

The Editor of the Tuesday Edition
attended the Executive Committee
meeting, and observed to the com-
mittee that it would be unfortunate
if Washington and Lee’s “good name”
were to be associated with “polls”
of the member-schools of the VASG,
assuming that W&L voted in the
minority of such a poll.

Evidently, the Tuesday Editor fears
that the VASG will inevitably take
political stands a la the Nationai
Student Association (membership in
which the W&L student body over-
whemingly rejected two years ago).
However, there is no official indica-
tion that such polls or stands will be
taken by the VASG; to conject that
such polls will occur is unfair to the
organization and is ludicrous.

The Tuesday Edition’s lead article
states, “EC consensus said it
would be better to wait and see how
[the VASG] develops and in what
directions it moves.” Perhaps it has
not occurred to the seven dissenting
members of the Executive Committee
that W&L’s influence could very well
move the direction of the VASG in
a favorable direction. Our absence
from it may very well destroy it.

Generals Annihilate Rams 61-40
In Unimpressive Doremus Debut

By SHELDON MILLER

Washington and Lee’s basketball
Generals made their 1967-68 debut
in Doremus Gymnasium Tuesday
night with an unimpressive 61-40 vic-
tory over R.P.I. In a game that started
and ended with floor mistakes, the
Rams’ “slow-down” ball was not con-
clusive to an exciting or well-played
contest,

After four minutes of Ram_ ball
control, Steve Harvey pumped in a
jump shot to open the scoring for the
visitors, and with 13:30 remaining in
the half, the Generals were down by
an excruciating five points, 8-3.

Ihe Generals finally took the lead
11-10 on a Mel Cartwright free throw
with 3:46 left in the half, and im-
mediately thereafter went into a very
effective and obviously well-disciplin-
ed full-court press which forced the
Rams into three quick turnovers, all
resulting in baskets for the Blue.
When the buzzer sounded ending the
half, the Generals, thanks to an ex-
cellent pressure defense but with very
little assistance from a_ sluggish
offense, led 28-12.

Second Half Strategy

fense in the second half, W&L held

With ten minutes remaining, Verne
Canfield unloaded his bench and gave
the second-stringers a chance to see

admirably, with freshman Bill Rhyne
dropping in two long jumpers, Charlie
Stone playing heads-up defense, and
Earl Edwards, Rob Bauer, and Stu

at both ends of the court.

The “Three M’s” Return

The first team, after five minutes’
rest, came back to finish the game.
Led by the “Three M’s,” Mel (Cart-

(Neer), the Generals remained in con-
trol and left the court 61-40 victors.

A Soggy Saga

Another brilliant chapter was
written yesterday in the saga of
Doremus Gymnasium; when the
Washington and Lee swimming
team proved once again that
it's not how you play the game,
but if you win or lose, as the
tankers won a victory by default
over Roanoke College due to the
interesting fact the Roanoke Col-
lege does not have a swimming
team.

“We scheduled them knowing
this might happen,” swimming
coach Bill Stearns commented, “as
they were having trouble finding
enough swimmers.”

The Generals will try to even
their season mark at 1-1 Saturday
when they face Gettysburg at 1:00
in Doremus, Coach Stearns has as-
sured the Ring-tum Phi that Gettys-
burg has a team.

Against Tarheels
Tomorrow Night

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team will attempt to avenge last
year’s 29-0 thrashing by the Univer-
sity of North Carolina (Chapel Hill)
tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m. in
Doremus Gymnasium, Last year was
the first time since 1925 that the
Tarheels had defeated a W&L wrestl-
ing team and Coach Dick Miller
hopes to make it the last.

North Carolina has only two re-
turning lettermen, while everyone on
the well-balanced W&L squad has
lettered previously except the two
freshmen.

The Generals on the road last
weekend defeated Galaudet School
for the Deaf in Washington 28-8. Fri-
day night, but lost to a strong Towson
squad 26-11 in Baltimore on Satur-
day night. Helping the W&L effort
were:

Raz Razberry, a sophomore wrestl-
ing 123, was pinned at Gallaudet, but
pulled out an 10-8 victory at Towson.
Freshman Whit Morrill wrestling his
first college bout at 130 won by a
forfeit at Galladuet but, unfortunately
drew one of Towson’s better wrestlers
and lost 7-2. Last year’s oustanding
freshman wrestler Mark Hendrickson
won, wrestling 137, at Galladuet, 3-2,
but lost 10-7 at Towson.

Loss On Fluke

In the 145 pound class co-captain
Bobby Paine, a senior, wiped up at
Galladuet, 11-2, but was pinned by a
fluke at Towson while he was win-
ning 6-0. The other co-captain, Don
O’Har, a senior won at Galladuet
5-2, at 162, but also lost at Towson
3-1. Dan Higgins, a sophomore was
also successful at Galladuet winning
6-3, at 160. But he was up against
Towson’s most outstanding wrestler
and was pinned.

At 167, Holmes Raker a senior,
won at Gallaudet 7-0 but also was
pinned at Towson while winning 4-2.

boxing. Boxing has become a_busi-
ness, and as such, fighters are being
guided by CPA’s rather than fight
managers. No longer are boxers
trained, taught, and fostered by the
managers of old. Their careers are
guided with one thought in mind—
how to secure the fast buck and the
instant success.

The number of really good fight
managers stands at one—Angelo Dun
dee. And so great has the business
image of the fight game become,
that boxers such as Clay even ignore
the competent advice of a few men
around who know what they're doing.

Mistaken Assumption
Not only are those involved with
boxing fooling themselves by think-
ing that a money-oriented tournament
such as the present farce can produce
any real indication of a champion,

but the American public is being
swept along on the wave of con
census,

Let me propose a panacea equal
in logic to the WBA _ tournament.
First, complete the tournament in its
present form. Next, having duly pro-
claimed a champion, check and see
if there are any Pete Radamachers
available to challenge the champ.
Finally, having milked all these pos-
sibilities dry, organize a barnstorm-
ing tour in which the WBA champ
will face all comers the world over.
There must be a few rubes with a
few coins who deserve to see boxing
at its best.

Webster who wrestled 177 was one
of two double winners. Webster
pinned his Gadulet opponent and had
no trouble disposing of his Towson
adversary, 4-0. Jay Clarke, a junior
wrestling 191, also won twice for
the Generals through he was wrestl-
ing much above his actual weight. He
won at Gadulet, 5-4, and at Towson,
3-0. Junior Bobby Paine, at heavy-
weight, was also much above his
actual weight and his opponents were
quite large. He lost 5-4 at Gadulei
and drew 5-5 at Towson

The lineup for the UNC

The service is an ancient form of
corporate worship at the Christmas
season, and was first revived for mod-
ern use in England during the 19+h
century. It is broadcast each year
from King’s College Chapel at Cam-
bridge and is widely used in schools
and colleges both in England and
the U.S.

College Inn Reopens Resin

over by the third generation, was
begun in 1937 by Steve Neofotis when
he opened Steve's Diner on North
Main (it is still owned by the Neofotis
family but rented to others). Steve
came from New York where he had
previously owned restaurants on
Broadway. The Diner was a favorite
stomping ground for both students and
faculty of both schools. Former cus-
tomers from the old days still come
back and ask for Steve, now 81, re-
tired, and on a visit to Greece. He
is credited with bringing New York
food to Lexington.

In 1954 Steve's son, Pete, an ex

professional middleweight fighter
opened the “old” College Inn next
door to the present one, Pete, a

great sports fan, gave up pro-fighting
at the insistence of his wife, and was
trained in his father’s restaurants.
The old Inn was closed two weeks
before graduation last June because
the Neofotis’ were busy with the
House of Beef and they weren't
pleased with the way the inn was
being run by other people; it lacked

Neofotis’ were running it. Now with
the leasing of their other restaurant,
the Neofotis’ turn their attention to
reviving the famous College Inn.

The family can hardly wait to get
the College Inn open and the students
from past years who remember the
old Inn, are just as impatient. Mrs.
Neofotis stated that people have been
calling and asking her on the sireet
when they would reopen. Only time

For Christmas Festivities

Ihe Christmas season has already
started at W&L. The tree in the front
yard of the Lee House has been lit,
wreaths have been hung in the Com-
mons windows, and candles have been
put in the windows along the colon-
nade. Campus groups have also start-
ed their special yuletide events, most
of them continuing into this week.

The campus vocal and music groups
have gone all out for the Christmas
season again this year. The 55-voice
Washington and Lee Glee Club has
yet to present its annual Christmas
candlelight service with traditional
carols at 8 p.m., Thursday, Dec. 14,
at the Robert E. Lee Memorial Epis-
copal Church. The University Fed-
eration of Christian Concern will
participate in the service.

Foreign Language Concert

The 20th annual Foreign Language
Christmas Sing, one of Lexington’s
traditional but most unusual Yule
events, will be held Wednesday, Dec.
13, in Lee Chapel beginning at 5 p.m.
The program, during which Washing-
ton and Lee students sing a number
of holiday songs in various languages,
has proved in the past to be very
popular, especially with the children.

As in the past, the audience will

 

participate in the singing of several
of the songs. Programs outlining the
nature of the tunes and song sheets!
will be distributed at the door.

Both Christmas and secular songs
are included in the program. the

Page 2

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

A Thoughtful Wish

Scientists at the University of Michigan have shown that
even so lowly a species as the flatworm can eventually profit
by experience. Why, then, cannot the Inter-Fraternity Council?

It is now 13 months since the faculty first made its posi-
tion on rush clear. That position has been re-stated twice since,
in May and October, 1967, with the pro-immediate-rush voices
becoming quieter each time it comes before the faculty again.
And the IFC has failed absolutely to bring about a thing, even
to pay lip service to a faculty which is a) in a position of
direct superiority over it, for good or for bad, and b) obviously
not pleased. We suspect that the faculty vote could eventually
become unanimous—the progression has been in that direc-
tion—and still the Inter-Fraternity Council would eschew posi-
tive activity of even the most rudimentary sort.

The recent IFC-Faculty Coffee, which amounted to a
meeting of members of opposing factions with the Uni-
versity community, was a disaster of the first magnitude. Only
eight per cent of the University faculty bothered to show up—
bothered to give fraternities a further hearing on a subject the
faculty obviously feels is long settlked—bothered even to
acknowledge an ability and legitimacy on the IFC’s part to
discuss the matter. Great concern would not be an inappropriate
emotion with which fraternities might view that situation.

Whether the faculty is good or evil, whether the faculty
ought to be legislating in this field at all, whether the faculty
is acting as benevolent despots or malevolent tyrants—this
has not the remotest bearing on what the IFC must do. We
don’t like it, either; but it could be no more obvious that cir-
cumstances have brought fraternities to the point where they
exist purely at the pleasure of the faculty. And the faculty has
made its particular displeasure at the present state of things
eminently well known.

The minds of the faculty cannot be changed, not even if
every fraternity man in the South wants their minds to be
changed, on the fundamentals. This the faculty itself has said:
ask any faculty member who voted for deferred rush (most
will tell how they voted) whether anything conceivably could
make him change his mind. Fraternities can and are obliged to
modify and help shape deferred rush, within the boundaries
arbitrarily set by the faculty, but they cannot change it. And
they have to veer away from continuing the impertinent and
impotent practice of telling the faculty it is wrong or naive.

The IFC’s deferred rush committee—the entr’acte in the
present “drama”—has said its major problems are what to
do about contact between upperclassmen and freshmen until
rush can legally take place, and the structure within which the
actual rushing will take place. Although neither “major prob-
lem” specified by the committee bears any resemblance to the
actual “‘major problems’ that somebody—either the IFC or
the faculty—will have to contend with, there is nothing more
wrong with them than their being a waste of time.

The committee also plans to poll the deans of various
universities on rush, deferred and immediate, presumably in
an attempt to lend some authority to a similar poll taken among

other schools’ IFC presidents last year—a poll that was thrown |
out by the faculty as invalid. There are still, it is apparent, |
some people who just won't see the forest for the trees, who |
are happily oblivious to the most patently obvious of trends. |

What applicability could the situation at Richmond, or Carnegie
Tech, or even Amherst or Williams, have to Washington and
Lee—assuming the faculty would even consider another com-
parative study, which it has said it won't? Again, rightly
or wrongly, the faculty has carried the situation to the point of
no turning back. They themselves describe it as a situation
of “finality.”

What would the faculty say if the IFC decided not to
burden and irritate it with another meaningless, ineffectual
“rush in comparable schools” study. What would the faculty
say if the IFC directed its attentions, for a change, to con-
structing a reasonable, practicable, acceptable program, instead
of quixotically taking another poll that will lead absolutely
nowhere at all?

The faculty has indicated that almost anything that can in
good faith be called “deferred” will not be rejected. But
beyond that boundary the faculty will not go. Even the most
sweeping revision of pledging rules in anybody's memory was
termed “commendable” but “unacceptable” as a response
to the demand for deferred rush. The faculty has further indi-
cated that it will accept nothing less than one full semester's
delay; and if the IFC neglects to set up a body of regulations
covering rush under those conditions, the faculty has indicated
it would rather allow, at least during the first year, unchecked
chaos than bother itself with formulating a plan for fraternities
to follow. Perhaps fraternities want this; perhaps they want to
show what will happen unless the faculty compromises with
it (and wanting the faculty to compromise is not itself wrong).
But if this is the case, the IPC’s handling of the matter from
ad public -relations point of view is abominable.

Please, though: no more polls, no more revanchism, no
more anti-pragmatism. The faculty long ago cornered the
power market, and the students are left less and less room

Ring-tum Phi; Senator Morton, does the election of Republican Louis B.
Nunn as governor of Kentucky indicate a significant trend toward Republic-

anism in your state?

Senator Morton: You'll have to bear in mind that .

of such interviews with prominent

won, and he won by a comfortable majority, but we lost the other Consti-
tutional offices except for two or three minor ones. In the city of Louisville,
where we have a Republican mayor, and we had a Republican city council
(we call it the Board of Aldermen), we lost 11 out of 12 on the Board of
Aldermen.

So I don't think one can take it as significant. I'm very happy that
Judge Nunn was elected, of course—the first Republican in 25 years. But
I'm not going to accept as being something that means, for instance, that
I'm a shoo-in in 1968, I'm going to work my head off.

R-t Phi: In the recent election, a candidate from former Alabama Governor
George Wallace's American Independent Party ran very unsuccessfully in
Kentucky. Would you say this contradicts Governor Nunn’s victory in that

Morten: No, | do not. | have known Gene McCarthy ever since he came
to the House of Representatives. We served together there for I think it
was four years, and now I've served with him in the Senate for some ten
or twelve years,

And he is a sincere person; | may not agree with him on many issues—
we're both members of the Finance Committee, and we've had many dis-
agreements—but I don’t question his sincerity and I don’t think he’s anybody’s
stalking-horse.

R-t Phi: What do you think of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s
statement last week indicating that he might accept a genuine draft for
the Republican nomination?
Morton; | think this would come
about if we find ourselves in
Miami Beach in a deadlock, or at
least with no candidate there who
can win it on the first one or
two ballots. I think Governor
Rockefeller might well put him-
self into the race and go after it.
But short of that, | don’t think
he’s going to get in. | accept his

 

'

 

conservatism may not any longer be a synonym for Republicanism?

Morton: No, no. This fellow ran merely to get two percent of the vote, which
is required to get on the ballot, and he failed miserably in this. 1 don’t
think this a question of a judgment of conservatism at all... {Judge Nunn]
is, | would class him, a conservative, but he certainly is a positive con-

servative.

I think one can be conservative without being negative; and I think this
is one of the problems that Republicans face, that our conservatism has
been associated with negativism. Now,
positive programs, but within a conservative framework. And I think this

is what showed up in our election.

R-t Phi: Do you think the people of the United States are afraid of con-
Servatism, as a carryover from Senator Goldwater's candidacy?

Morton: | think if conservatism is put in a negative attitude, that it would
be rejected by the majority of voting citizens in the United States, On the
other hand, I think we've shown by picking up twenty-six gubernatorial seats—
58 percent of the population are now under Republican governors—that
you can have what I call a positive conservatism. | think you can move
this country forward within the tenets and within the mores and within the
framework of its traditions which have been, in the main, conservative.

R-t Phi: Do you expect Republicans to capitalize on the split in the
Democratic Party evidenced by the candidacy of Senator Eugene McCarthy?
Morton: It’s hard to say just what'll happen, but I know perfectly well that
Republicans will capitalize on it. | mean, I think that any split in the
Democratic party, of course, would work to the benefit of Republicans... .

former statements, that he’s not a
candidate, that he’s supporting
Governor Romney, at face value,
Do you see an apparent front-runner at this time?

 

R-t Phi:
Morton: I'd say at this time, if you're speaking of the nomination, now, . , .

one has to say that Dick Nixon is ahead.

R-t Phi: Whom do you favor for the Republican presidential nomination?
Morton: | favor anybody that can get elected. I can be comfortable with any-
body that’s been mentioned, and I'm going to watch the first two or three
primaries. I'll probably be for somebody when we get to Miami Beach,
but at this point I haven't made a choice,

I have the highest regard for all those that have been mentioned. I'm
not trying to be coy about this, but I want just not only to see someone
nominated, | want to see somebody elected in November.

R-t Phi: Is there any candidate you especially would not like to see obtain
the nomination?

Morton: No, | have no quarrel with any of those who have been mentioned,
rhe only one | can think of that | wouldn't want to see get nominated is a
guy from Kentucky named Morton,

R-t Phi: You have been labeled a “dove” in the Republican Party. What is
your position on Vietnam?

Morton: | don’t like these absolute terms of “hawk” and “dove.” I do dis-
agree with our present policies in Vietnam; now this doesn’t mean that I
want to send an armada over there and pull out our troops.

I think this hunt and destroy business that we're engaged in in the north-
ern part of South Vietnam is costing us an awful lot in blood and treasure.
And 1 can't see that it’s producing anything -very few people live there.
I'd like to see us try to secure the twenty percent of the area in which
eighty perecent of the people live.

Every time I read that we take Hill 885 upper in the northern
part and lose, let’s say, 26 casualties, and the next week we have to take
it back again and then the next edition of the paper says that within 20
miles of Saigon 14 people were killed—this to me is a little bit unrealistic.

And I think we could certainly change our tactics there. which would
cut our casualties immeasurably and probably in the end lead to a solution
to this dilemma.

This past weekend Coach Canfield
added one more trophy to his collect-
ion as the Generals took third place
in the Randolph-Macon Invitational
Tournament in Ashland. Macon took
first place, Lycoming second, and
Maryville fourth.

Friday night in the opening game
of the Tournament the Generals lost
to Lycoming by a score of 78-70,
The Generals had as much as a nine-
point lead in the first half but the
half ended in a deadlock at 37-37.
The second half saw Lycoming domi-
nate scoring and go on to spread
the gap that the Generals never man-
aged to close.

The Generals problem in Friday's
contest was that they had no offensive
movement and committed 20  turn-
overs which were converted into 22
points by Lycoming. The Generals
did managed to out rebound Lycom-
ing (45-37) and out shoot them (49%

 

 

the W&L swimmers performed especi-
ally well including freshman standout

John Ackerman, Harry Hill, and Paul
Sugar, while in the next lane an ex-
hibition team of Ball, Catlin, Kymp-
ton, and Forman finished off this

from the floor and 63% from the
| line). Another highlight for the Gen-
| erals was the fine job done by Mike
Neer as he poured in 22 points and
' dominated the boards. Wesselink also
/had a hot hand, scoring 16 points.
| Mel Cartwright was double teamed
most of the night and only got 8.

Saturday night’s game was a dif-
ferent story as the Big Blue had three
men with 20 or more points and
masacred Maryville 102-62. The Gen-
erals ran with the ball but also man-
aged to play a good defensive game.
They out rebounded Maryville 55-37
and shot a fantastic 62% from the
floor. Also their foul shooting looked
considerably better at 74%.

Mike Neer led the Generals’ scor-
ing with 29, Cartwright followed with
25, then Bauer with 20. Coach Can-
field had the following to say about

Washington and Lee University
head football coach Lee M. Mc-

To In vestigate
Rule Violations

Rumors that several fraternities

might face prosecution by the IF¢
Judicial Board for failure to obtain
permission for parties on the week

end of December 8 and 9 have been
denied by IFC president Ellis Zahra

Zahra said that an investigation by
IFC social chairman Ed Allen showed
that only one house had apparently
failed to comply with IFC rules re
quiring advance notice of parties. He

added, however, that it is not vet
certain that any violation has been
committed.

No action is likely to be taken

until after Christmas hilidays

Liquor-By-The-Drink
Supported By Levin
By FRANK ROSE

“After dark, history is not enough.”

Phis the attitude expressed
by Bernard Levin, a member of the
Virginia House of Delegates from
Norfolk, in a speech Tuesday night
before the Political Science and
Young Democrat clubs

Levin spoke for “a number of Vis
ginia legislators” when he said that
liquor-by-the-drink was necessary to
bring conventions and tourists into the
State. He added that “Virginia is a
step behind the times” in this respect.

The issue concerns the passage of
a bill by the General Assembly
authorizing local option on liquor-by
| the-drink, or “Shall localities have
| the right to vote on the right to have
whiskey served under the strict sup

was

 

}ervision of the existing Alcoholic
Beverage Control Board?”
If this bill were passed, Levin

stated, the rules on the sale of liquor
would be much the same as those
already applied to the sale of beer
and wine. This means that the peo
ple of each locality would be allow
ed to decide if liquor would be sold
by the drink in their areas

Levin cited numerous reports. in
cluding one prepared by Richmond
Professional Institute, stating that the
assumption that “prohibition is di
| rectly related to consumption is mis
| leading,” and that “prohibition is of
little or no significance” in the occur
rences of problems with alcohol

When asked about the chances of
the bill's passage by the 1968 Gen

eral Assembly, Levin said that the
problem with the bill is “just basic
politics,” with urban areas in favor

of the bill and rural areas opposed
to it. However, he pointed out that

Reason For Survival

It used to be called the Vigilance Committee, and its
black-robed members were empowered to paddle any fresh-
man for forgetting to wear his blue beanie and green tie to
every social gathering. When corporal punishment was abol-
ished it continued to levy fines on offenders against tradition;
and if fines proved unimpressive to the coatless, tieless student,
it could arrange though the EC for social probation. “Dictator-
ial little cabal!’’ said the columnists. “Legal buffoonery and
petty tyranny!” said the reformers. But the Assimilation Com-
mittee has fallen on hard times now, and when the Forensic
Union met Wednesday night in Payne 6 to debate whether
or not it should be abolished, there were only seventeen
students and a dog who cared enough to attend.

Still, the debate was interesting. It got some things out
into the open that everybody has been thinking for a long
time—that the Assimilation Committee ought to be abolished;
and also some things which people have perhaps not been
thinking about—that the Committee's work actually serves a
useful function.

Dick Penny and Rudd Smith, defending abolition of the
committee, probably had the sympathies of most W&L stu-
dents on their side. A vote of the spectators before the debate
started showed that 5 were in favor of ending the committee
while 3 favored keeping it on.

Their arguments centered chiefly around the commit-
tee’s ineffectiveness. It did not succeed in enforcing conven-
tional dress even when it had fining powers, they pointed
out, and is even less capable of doing so now. Its meetings
are infrequent (the last was a month ago). Its concrete activi-
ties are restricted to preparation of the Student Handbook,
arranging Orientation Week so as to allow freshmen the
maximum opportunity to join W&L organizations and activi-
ties, and visiting freshmen in the dorms once or twice a year
to answer questions and give advice on the subject of W&L
traditions. And even these activities, they argued, could be
performed more economically and effectively if they were
spread out among other groups. The enforcement of conven-
tional dress and wearing of name tags might be better left up
to the IFC (which supplies them anyway) and the dorm
counselors (who see the freshmen every day). The speaking
tradition should be the responsibility of all upperclassmen.
The Student Handbook could be handled by the IFC.

On the face of it, they were right: the concrete activities
of the present Assimilation Committee doubtless could be
conducted by other groups and organizations. Presumably,
this is what the spectators felt Wednesday night when, after
the debate, they voted 8-5 in favor of abolishing the Commit-
tee.

But one other point was made during the debate which
seemed to us highly significant. It was implicit in almost all
the discussion, and it was explicitly stated by Smith when he
said “We do not attack what the committee stands for (our
boldface), but its ability to do what it says it can.” The criti-
cisms which he and Penny made were concerned with whether
the committee could carry out its function, not whether it
should do so; in proposing the abolition of the Assimilation
Committee itself, they were suggesting only that its task be
assigned to others to carry out.

The function of the Assimilation Committee, as both
sides of the debate seemed to recognize, is greater than any
of its concrete activities. It is the end for which these activities
are means: the assimilation of freshmen into the experience
of W&L life and values. Part of that assimilation involves
opening as many doors to him as possible in campus organiza-
tions. That's why there is an Orientation Week. Part involves
familiarizing him with aspects of W&L. That's what the
Student Handbook is for. A very important part is presenta-
tion and encouragement of certain traditions—not with threats
of paddles or fines, but on the understanding that these tradi-
tions exist and that the freshman is expected of his own free
will to observe and appreciate them,

This is the overall aim of the Assimilation Committee.
Its individual tasks could conceivably be handled by other
groups. But we doubt very much whether the goal behind
the individual aims would survive without the unifying purpose
of a single committee. Wendall Winn and Bill McDavid,
when they argued for preserving the committee, pointed out
that the Assimilation Committee is made up of people who are
on it because they want to be and because they are sincerely
interested in the overall goal of assimilation, It is not fair
to expect the same interest or effectiveness from groups such
as the IFC, which has its own aims, or from individual students
and professors. It is also foolish to think that assimilation can
be attained by means of a paragraph in the catalogue and a
speech or two at Freshman Camp—as Winn and McDavid
also pointed out. The Assimilation Committee can provide
unifying purpose and direction to what otherwise would be
unrelated assimilation activities. It is on that ground that it
deserves to exist.

Rather than abolish the committee, we would do better to

give it greater scope.

Plan, 1957-1967

 

 

 

More Completed
Than Apparent

The above “Proposed Ten Year
Plan” is a reproduction of the plan
presented to the student body in 1957.
It represents the needs presented by
the University Development Office in
a booklet entitled “The Vision of
Greatness.”

Much of the plan has not been
accomplished, however a good deal
more than meets the eye has been.

In the Development Program plan,
immediate needs were listed as fol-

Maintenance Center
Long-range needs were:
Athletic Facilities
Auditorium

Dormitory

Amphitheater, Lake and Arboretum
Perimeter Road and Parking Areas
U tilities

Alumni and Faculty Cab
Memorial Entrance Gates,

The cost of this program was ex-
pected to come to almost $6,000,000.
All of the Immediate Needs have been
met, although not necessarily as they
are listed above. A new science build-
ing for Physics and Biology was built,
and Howe Hall was remodeled to
include Chemistry and Geology, In
the Long-Run needs, a new dormitory
was built, some remoeling was com-
pleted, an alumni and faculty club
was built, and the memoral entrance
gates were established.

In addition, a supply store and
co-op was built. a new Student Union
is in the process of construction, and
Lee Chapel was restored.

The Development Office ceased to
exist when Dr. Fred Cole became
President. Dr. Cole feeling that sys-
tematic fund-raising between cam-
paigns was too costly. In deference to

Letters To The Editor...

 

Editorial Hearsay
Dear Sirs:

1 was appalled at the editorial which
appeared in the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi this week. The editor evidently
gained his information from pure
hearsay, as he did not attend the
IFG-Faculty Coffee. 1 don't even
think that it was covered by a Ring-
tum Phi reporter since there was no
article about it in either edition, al-
though the Friday edition did have a
picture. At any rate, the editor was
obviously misinformed or uninformed

 

deferred rush problems. The editor
does recognize the fact of existence
of the Deferred Rush Committee, but
claims that the problems it is con-
cerned with are a “waste of time.”
What are the “actual” major problems
of a deferred rush committee if they
are not the problems of contact be-
fore rush begins, and the actual
structure of a system of rush?

The editor has misrepresented the
nature of the study the Deferred Rush
Committee is doing. It is not a “poll
of deans of various universities on
rush, deferred and immediate,” and

In the first place the entire purpose | it is not an attempt to verify the

of the Coffee was misunderstood. The
purpose was not to discuss whether
or not deferred rush should come to
WAL, or how to avoid it, This is
what the editor would have us think.
The IFC has accepted the fact that
deferred rush is coming, although
admittedly this was not accepted as
soon as it should have been. The
purpose of the IFC Coffee was for
a critique of the present system of
deferred pledging and for an ex-
change of ideas on systems of de-
ferred rush,

The meeting was definitely not “a
disaster of the first magnitude.” The
faculty members present took an in-
terested part in the discussion and
the Deferred Rush Committee re-
ceived some useful ideas. The meet-
ing was such a success that it lasted
twenty minutes longer than planned,
mostly because of faculty participa-
tion. Perhaps the light turn out of
faculty was due to a misundersiand-
ing of the true purpose of the meet-
ing. or due to the fact that the indi-
vidual invitations to faculty members
were not received until the day of
the Coffee.

Has Not Failed

The IFC obviosuly has not “failed
to bring about a thing” The De-
ferred Rush Committee is meeting
regularly and plans to bring a plan
for deferred rush before the IFC this
Spring. The IFC-Faculty Coffee was
not a meeting of “opposing factions,”
but a meeting for the resolution al

 

results of last year’s poll, Again the
editor is misinformed. The purpose
of the study is to see how other
universities have instituted a system
of deferred rush, and to see what
problems they came up against. In
this manner the Deferred Rush Com-
mitiee can better devise a solid system
of deferred rush and attempt to fore-
see and clear up many problems.

Would the editor have us create a
sysiem out of thin air, completely
oblivious of the experience which
other universities have had with de-
ferred rush? Does not the editor
realize that even a flatworm can profit
by experience? Evidently not. Dean
Atwood has guessed that the faculty
will accept whatever system the IFC
proposes as long as there is no rush
before second semester. The IFC and
the Deferred Rush Committee fully
realize this and are attempting to find
the best possible system.

Stupid, Short-Sighted Ignorance

Obviously the editor of the Tuesday
edition did not bother to acquaini
himself with the facts, His ignorance
resulted in a stupid, short-sighted, and
even malicious editorial. The Ring-
tum Phi is the major source of know!-
edge of fraternity events and other
student affairs for most of the faculty.
An editorial of this nature can be
very harmful to the IFC and fra-
lernity sysiem as a whole

In my opinion, the IFC has made
some mistakes in the past and has

This marked the second win of

as they overcame Lynchburg’s Hornets
68-44 in a game played Tuesday night
in Lynchburg. Lynchburg’s © stall
offense in the game kept the score
down, as well as putting the clamps
on the Generals’ attack A full-court
press and double-figure scoring by
four W&L players—Bauer (10), Cart-
wright (12), Fauber (11), and Carrere

W&L
13:57

Against Asheville-Biltmore,
opened with a flurry and with
left in the first half, held a 13-7
lead. After this things tightened, and
the Blue could never seem to stretch
the lead. This was due primarily to
Asheville-Biltmore’s very effective full
court press, which the Generals were
never able to break.

Although W&L completely domi-
nated the boards and was constantly
in control of the ball, the Bulldogs
managed to keep close, forcing turn-
over after turnover, and sinking some
beautiful shots from the outside.

With 7:50 remaining, the Generals
lead had been cut to 27-25, but after
this they started to pull away again
and when the half ended, the Blue
found itself with a 47-40 lead.

Second Half Tightens
The Generals were not yet out of

the woods though, and when the
second half started, the Bulldogs
started to creep up again. The Gen-

erals found themselves unable to get
in close to the basket as they had
in the first half and started shooting
from the outside. At the same time
as the offense began to run
trouble,

Hope was not to be lost, though.
With the Bulldog offense working the
ball for another score, John Carrere
stole the ball and ran down court
for a jump shot, The shot was good
and the Generals had the lead again
65-64, never again to be headed.

Sparked by another basket and the

Fraternities Victimized
By Thefts of Christmas

Decorations and Trees

The SAE’s and DU’s were both
struck last weekend by the disappear-
ance of the decorations for their
Saturday Christmas parties.

According to Bob Murray, Univer-
sity Proctor, all that is missing are
the Christmas trees, lights, and two
poinsetta plants, the last from the
SAE house. They were apparently
taken early Saturday morning, after
the decorations had been set up Fri-
day night.

Since the presents under both trees
were left alone, Murray said the work
was probably not that of local “hood-
lums,.” and that perhaps it could be
part of a pledge raid on the houses.

Letters To The Editor

not attacked all problems in the best
possible manner. However, in this
case the Deferred Rush Committee is
working a system and the IFC-
Faculty Coffee was a step in the right
direction for the solution of the prob-
lems of a deferred rush system as
applied to Washington and Lee. The
Interfraternity Council has many
problems to face on the behalf of
fraternities, and a misrepresentation
of the issues by a confused Ring-
tum Phi editor can only lead to
faculty misunderstanding and more
problems. An apology is certainly in
order.

dogs scored the final basket, but no
one minded or even seemed to notice.
Washington and Lee had beaten a
tough Asheville-Biltmore club by a
comfortable 85-72.

Although the Generals’ teamwork
was greatly improved, the game was
filled with excellent individual per-
formances. Mike Neer was magnifi-
cent under the boards. He grabbed
every rebound in range and was con-
stantly free underneath for easy lay-
ups. Despite the fact that he rested a
large part of the game, Neer scored
26 points and was the high scorer
for the game.

Also not to be forgotten are the
performances of Jody Kline and Mal
Wessclink. Kline played an outstand-
ing defensive game, pulling off sev-
eral turnovers and rebounding well.
Wesselink was spectacular, in the final
minutes especially. He scored sixteen
points, but eight of these were made

at the close and were largely re-
sponsible for sealing the win

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA: JANUARY 3, 1968

 

Huntley Named President

Robert E. R Huntley, dean of the
School of Law of Washington and
Lee University, has been elected pres-
ident of the 219-year-old school by
its Board of Trustees.

Dean Huntley’s selection as the
University’s 20th president was an-
nounced today by Dr. Huston St.
Clair of Surfside, Fla., rector of the
Board. The action took place at a
called meeting of the Board in mid-
December.

Dean Huntley, 38, is an honor
graduate of Washington and Lee and
its Law School and holds the LL.M.
from the Harvard Law School. He
will begin his duties as president at
the start of the spring semester on
Feb. 5, 1968.

He will take over the president's
chair from Dr. William W. Pusey
III, who has been acting president
since Sept. 1, 1967. Dr. Pusey, who
has continued to serve as dean of
Washington and Lee’s College, be-
came acting president when President
Fred C. Cole resigned to become pres-
ident of the Council on Library Re-
sources, Inc., in Washington, D. C.

Dr. Pusey will continue as dean of
the College after Dean Huntley as-
sumes the presidency.

Dean Huntley's duties as dean of
the Law School, an office which he
occupied at the beginning of this
school year, will be reassumed for the
remainder of the year by Prof.

Charles P. Light Jr. Dean Light re-
tired in September, 1967, as dean and

  
 
 
 
 
  

 

DEAN ROBERT E. R. HUNTLEY, named president of Washington and Lee University, gathers with his family

has continued his teaching. Dean
Huntley, a member of the Washing-
ton and Lee faculty since 1958, also
will continue to teach law courses for
the remainder of the school year.
Dr. St. Clair said Dean Huntley
was chosen president from a long list
of candidates considered by a special
selection committee of the Board of

Trustees. The committee worked
closely with a faculty advisory com-
mittee and representatives of the

Washington and Lee Alumni Board of
Directors in finding a permanent suc-
cessor for Dr Cole. Student opin-

ion also was sought.

“We are fortunate that Dean Hunt-
ley has accepted the presidency of
the University,” Dr. St. Clair said.

“Dean Huntley is eminently quali-
fied to lead Washington and Lee
University in the years of opportuni-
ty and challenge before it. He has
youth and vigor, a deep devotion to
his alma mater, and a close ac-
quaintanceship with its people and its
special needs.

“Dean Huntley has excelled as a
teacher and an administrator, and
he has acquired special knowledge
of conditions in American higher
education in his capacities as a pro-
fessor and as legal adviser to the|
University and as secretary of the
Board of Trustees.

“IT am confident that his election
will be greeted w.th enthusiasm by
everyone connected with the Univer-

 

sity and with higher education
throughout the nation.”
Speaking to the press _ this

morning, Dean Huntley indicated
he plans no major departures from
current policies and guidelines for
the University’s development,

Among matters discussed at the
conference: possible graduate pro-
grams af W&L (“No”), fraternities
(Dean Huntley is optimistic about
their potential to adapt without
fundamental change), fulure expan-
sion (not out of the question) and
a development program (about to
be undertaken, with a figure of
“around $25 million” being men-
tioned).

Dean Huntley is the first alumnus
to become permanent president of the
University since pre-Civil War days.
The office of president dates to 1782,
when William Graham became the
first president of Liberty Hall Aca-
demy, forerunner of Washington

College, which after the presidency

of General Robert E. Lee became
Washingion and Lee University in

1871. Five of the school’s 20 chief |
executives since the time of Graham |
have been acting presiden‘s, serving |

only brief periods.

Volume LXVII, Number 23-B (Extra)

Republican Leader
On Campus Jan. 11

Former Vice - Presideni
Richard M. Nixon will speak
at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity January 11.

Nixon will address the an-
nual “Tap Day” ceremony for
Omicron Delta Kappa, nation-
al honorary leadership society
founded at Washington and
Lee in 1914.

Officials for Nixon who are
arranging the appearance have
given no indication of the for-
mer  vice-president’s _ topic,

 

other than it will be “non-
political” since Nixon has not
yet officially announced wheth- |
er he is a presidential candi-|

date.

Nixon has been quoted as saying
he will announce his decision in Jan-
uary. As previously scheduled, he
also will speak later that same day
at a Richmond Chamber of Com
merce dinner meeting.

A number of Washington and Lee
undergraduates and several alumni
will be “tapped” for membersh’p in
the society following Nixon’s talk at
noon. A brief ceremony, during which
present members of ODK will tap the
new members on the shoulder to sig-
nal their selection, will precede a
question-and-answer-session with stu-|
den‘s

Public announcement of those chos-
en for membersh’p is not made until
they are tapped

Nixon, who is already a member
of ODK, was invited to the campus
by W&L senior David T. Johnson, Jr.,
of Pensacola, Fla., president of the
local chapter.

The ODK ceremony at Washing on
and Lee is tradit‘onally an offic.al
University assembly, and all siudents
and faculty members are expected to
attend. This year’s 53rd annual event
will take place in Doremus Gymna-
sium beginning at noon.

Dus to the assembly, there will be
short classes on Thursday. Classes
will begin at 8:25 am and will ex-
tend for forty minutes ins:ead of the
regular fifty-five, ending at 11:45 a.m.

After serving as a United States
Representative and as a Senator from
California, Nixon was elected V.ce
President of the United States in
1952 and was re-elected in 1956,

He won the Republican nomination

for President of the United States in|

1960, and lost by a marg:n of only

one-tenth of one per cent of the popu-
lar vote. He ran for Governor of
California in 1962 and was defeated
by incumbent Democrat Pat Brown.

Since then, Nixon has practiced law
in New York City and has travelled
widely.

During his term of office as Vice-
President, Nixon saw the powers and
prerogatives of that office expanded
more in eight years than during the
entire 162 years previous.

 

 

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, JANUARY 4, 1968

ODK Assembly To Hear Nixon

 

| Nixon: A Political Phoenix

by PAT AREY

Richard Nixon, political myth, or
epithet? He is the man who has
been written off as “finished” in na-
tional politics more times than any
other politician in American history.

And yet no politician has become
so admired by party workers and reg-
ulars in the history of the Republican
Party.

Despised by the intellectual com-
munity on the left, and not quite
trusted on the right, even though
he is Barry Goldwater’s choice for
the 1968 GOP Presidential nomina-

Richard M. Nixon

tion, and lacking a political base to
operate from, incredibly, Richard M.
Nixon may well end up with another
crack at the Presidency. Eight years
ago, he lost that office by a hair.

Six years ago, following his defeat
by California Governor Pat Brown,
Time magazine wrote Richard Nix-
on’s political obituary; so did every-
one else.

He campaigned heavily in the
1964 campaign. He campaigned again
in the isolated state elections in 1965,
He made a swing through Virginia,
where he gained an ally in the GOP
gubernatorial nominee A. Linwood
Holton, who is now a member of the
Nixon for President Committee.

Nixon was the most active of out-
side campaigners in the 1966 Con-
gressional races. He ran up an im-
pressive score in Republican victories
in the districts he campaigned.

No single Republican has whole-
heartedly given so much of his time
to his party, with so little to expect
in reward from his party’s right and
left.

But today, unquestionably that re-
ward looms large. In short, Dick Nix-
on, as the political adage goes, has
“done his homework.”

But more than a cloud looms dist-
ant on Nixon horizons. The plain
facts are, Richard Nixon’s support
among potential delegates to the Re-
publican National Convention next
August is marginal. He has no sup-
port on the left; and his support on
| the right would melt under a Reagan
boom.

One must admire the man. He has
| worked long and hard for his party.
| It could be said he has earned the
nomination more than any other Re
| publican.

But 1968 seems a winning year for
| the Republicans. Many state parties
|are tying up their delegates under
| favorite son candidacies. The party
| wants a winner. And ironically, the

 

|| One man who seems a winner, the

|
man who has been endorsed on the

‘ | Republican right and left, the man

who isn’t running, the man who
nominated Richard E. Nixon in 1960,
is Governor Nelson A. Rockfeller of
New York.

Richard Nixon, to many people,
looks too much like a loser.

To win the nomination, Richard
Nixon must wn all the primaries,
and he must w.n big. If he stumbles
once, he is dead. If the Ronald Rea-
gan movement gets going, Nixon is
dead. If the Republicans want a win-
ner, Nixon may very well be dead

Can he win? Odd-numbered years
are usually good years for wine. Per
haps 1968 will be a good year for
Nixon. The campaign begins in nine
wecks

until 1950, when he was elected sena-
tor from California. This campaign,
in which he defeated the Democratic
nominee Helen Douglas, “The New
Republic” called “one of the best
financed, well publicized and most
underhanded campaigns in Cali-|
fornia’s history.”

In 1952 Nixon became Vice-Presi-
dent under Eisenhower. He served in
this position until 1960, when he be-
came the Republican _ presidential
nominee. In a tight campaign he was
defeated by John F. Kennedy, who!

is

The chances for Nixon’s nomina-
tion rest largely on the results of the
forthcoming political primaries, the
first of which will take place in New
Hampshire this March, If he can win

| big in all or most of the primaries,

Nixon stands a good chance of captur-
ing the nomination. According to the
polls, Nixon is well ahead of Gov.

' Romney, his major political oppon-

ent, in most of these states. According
to “Time,” Nixon is leading Romney
3 to 1 in New Hampshire. In Wis-
consin, likewise, he is ahead by ten
percent.

Although he might win the pri-
maries, Nixon’s nomination is by no
means certain. In a recent issue of
“Newsweek” Nixon is predicted to
have only 561 votes of the 667 needed
to win.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

Tuesday, January 9, 1968

 

Dean Huntley

The pleasure of the Ring-tum Phi upon the nomination of
Robert Edward Royall Huntley as president of Washington
and Lee University is not easy to express. Rather than being
so presumptuous as to proclaim in these columns our assessment
of Dean Huntley’s potential as president of the University,
the Tuesday Edition is publishing today exerpts of remarks
he made to representatives of the Virginia press last week
shortly after the announcement of his election. One cannot
fail, we think, to be impressed and gratified, enormously.

 

Two Debts

We succumb, however, to the desire to comment on two re-
lated matters. Firstly, the Board of Trustees receives the thanks
and renewed respect of the Ring-tum Phi and, we think, of
everybody else for acting as quickly as it did and in the manner
it did, as well as for the particular choice it made. It is already
apparent that there will be no element of the University com-
munity that will be unable to work with Mr. Huntley with
the greatest effectiveness, in an atmosphere of understanding
and sincere amiability.

7 7 7 7 7 7

Secondly, the interim presidency of Dean William Webb
Pusey III must not be allowed to pass unnoticed and un-
thanked. In his first University appearance as acting president,
he said: “We will move ahead as best we can. It should be
realized, however, that common sense dictates that it will be
necessary to postpone some decisions until the new president
is appointed....His choices must not be unduly circum-
scribed by interim decisions.”

Moving ahead, and at the same time not unnecessarily
limiting the scope of Mr. Huntley’s choices, was to prove no
easy task. Yet Dean Pusey has been overwhelmingly success-
ful in fulfilling each of those pledges while not denying the
other. He worked long: lights often remained on in one or
the other of his offices when everybody else was long gone
home. His Thanksgiving and Christmas vacations were a great
deal shorter than those of the rest of the University commun-
ity. He made a point, too, of not disassociating himself from
the students and the faculty: he found time to talk with them
when he met them on the Colonnade or in the co-op or any-
where else, and to listen to people; he was at all times accessible
to all comers in either of his offices. He gave enormous
amounts of time helping the Ring-tum Phi, for example,
whenever we requested him to, even when we stepped out
of our proper bounds in asking. Even the fine touches were
superb, as when he attended the Trivia Contest as “Grand
Prize-Awarder” and produced his own finale to the program.
Mrs. Pusey, who has always been recognized as pre-eminent
in the art of gracious hostessing, was a magnificent first lady;

 

faculty, distinguished visitors and other University guests
came away from the Puseys’ social gatherings marvelling.

Dean Pusey has shirked nothing and yet has interloped
nowhere. For four months he has exercised the responsibilities
of the presidency, and the particular responsibilities of the
acting presidency, with the highest distinction, Washington
and Lee is grateful.

Dean Huntley Meets Press

The Tuesday Edition is pleased
to present a transcription of re-
marks made last week by Wash-
ington and Lee's president-elect,
Dean Robert E. R. Huntley, in
answer to questions to him in a
press conference.

The conference was _ tape-re-
corded by station manager Charles
E. Winston of WLUR-FM,
through whose courtesy the follow-
ing transcript was made possible.

Dean Huntley: I'd like to make one
comment before you ask questions. I
want to take this occasion to point
out how glad | am, and everybody
at Washington and that Dr.
Pusey has agreed to go on as dean
of the College, which is certainly the
first thing I needed to know before
accepting the election as president,
and a critical factor in the future of
the school. Of course we all owe him
a great debt of gratitude in stepping
into the breach during the last six
months.

Reporter: Dean Huntley, what do
you think is the growth potential of
Washington and Lee?

Huntley: | suppose

of years, there is almost no limit
to the size that it could become. I
don't anticipate that this will be
Washington and Lee's goal.

Reporter: Do you think it would be
good for Washington and Lee to
strive to become as large as it could?
Huntley: No, | do not.

Reporter: Can you see any threat to
small colleges in the developing com-
munity colleges?

Huntley: No, | don't see them as a
threat. | think that there will be a
need for some liaison between schools
like Washington and Lee and the
community colleges. | can't imagine
that the needs in the educational
world are so circumscribed that there
is not considerable room for both
kinds of institutions.

Reporter: Can you comment on the
apparent trend toward an increasing
demand for liberal arts education?
Huntley: | hope that you are correct
that there growing demand for
a liberal arts education in the coun-
try. Certainly Washington and
will continue to operate on the
sumption that you are correct that a
major need in higher education is for
emphasis on quality liberal arts edu
cation. This has been the dedication
of the school throughout, and will
continue to be. I don't think that the
“loose specialization” that occurs
through the law school and the
school of commerce inconsistent
with the continuing emphasis on liber-
al arts education. On the contrary,
the more or less unique relationship
between this “loose specialization”
and the continuing central emphasis
on liberal arts education are desirable
both to the liberal-arts people and
loose specialists

higher educational institution, with

tion in the lWheral arts, with student

bedy and faculty drawn from all
walks of life: and from acrom the
country, strongly motivated young

men who represent a crow-section of
society; and highly qualified faculty
members who are principally

terest in research and
scholarship important in their think-
ing, but secondary in motivation.
Reporter: Have you any notion

Huntley: No. The principal responsi-
bility for curricular innovation will
continue to be, as it has been, with
the faculty and the deans.

Reporter: One thing that was a ques-
tion a few years ago is the position
of the University on athletics. What
is your view?

n. E. R.

HUNTLEY

Huntley: The position of the school
in recent years on athletics is that it
constitutes and will continue to consti-
tute a major part of the liberal arts
program at Washington and Lee. |
believe that it strong program
which has had a few rocky years, |
hope that it has reached a maturing
now upon which it will be able to
build. We have recently named Coach
McLaughlin as the new athletic di-
rector for next year, and | think his
views are the same as those of the
institution in this kind of program.
I anticipate no change of direction in
the athletic program.

Reporter: | don't know about Wash-
ington and Lee, but more and more,
students throughout the country are
asking for a greater voice in admini-
stration. What do you think about
that? Is it true here?

is a

Huntley: | think it's true that they
more and more are asking for a
greater voice in the administration.
One point here is that for a long while,
students at Washington and Lee have
had a significant voice in nearly every
aspect of the operation of the school.
I think the legitimate demands which
the students have made for an addi-
tional voice in the affairs of the
school already are, to a large de-
reality Washington and
Lee. Student government has always
been in their hands, including the
Honor System and the administration
of student affairs

In addition, students participate on
some committees with faculty mem-
bers. Student views are solicited both
formally and informally on nearly all
matters which the school has to con-
front. The on matters of
major policy will continue to be made
by the Board and by the faculty. It
is also true that much more decision-
making has been entrusted to the
faculty here than in many other insti-
tutions, That, it seems to me, is quite
helpful, and there plan to
change that. though often it is time
consuming to the faculty

alumni about these matters, and I
think the consensus among alumni is,
in fact, not generally represented by
the comments you have suggested.
Certainly there have been some
changes in student dress habits, and
1 suppose that there will continue to
be such changes. I wish to make it
clear that I would prefer students
to dress in an appropriate fashion;
it adds a good deal to the atmosphere
of the school. But I would not antici-
pate that the faculty or Board would
wish to make any change in the
tradition here of allowing these mat-
ters to be determined within very
broad limits by the students them-
selves. My own observation is that
the students have shown a_ rather
large measure of responsibility in de-
ciding this for themselves. Dress
habits on campus, while they have
changed somewhat, seem to me to
be rather good. The speaking tradi-
tion is still more apparent by its
observance than by its breach. It may
be that it has slipped somewhat, but
by comparison with some other
campuses, I think Washington and Lee
measures up very well in both these
respects. I don’t think either of these
matters is thought of by the students,
the faculty, or the alumni, so far as
| am aware, as matters which are
critically important in themselves in
so far as they reflect the school’s
success in fostering a spirit of close
liaison between faculty and students
and among students. And so far as
they reflect that they are important.
As for the Honor System, in the
past years since I was a student, the
students have questioned the validity
of the system repeatedly, and they
will probably remain to do so. It
has survived this kind of questioning
with amazing vitality. | am confident
it is working very well with the high-
est student support and control.
Reporter: Is any plan or study being
made about independent study?
Huntley: There are no plans as yet
but there is much consideration as

the Committee on Courses and De-
grees has repeatedly conducted stud-
ies along these lines. What steps will
be taken in that direction I do not
subject of

know, but it is not a

which the Committee is unaware. The
faculty and student body have also
set up special committees to solely
study the curriculum, but I don't be
lieve they have a timetable for their
reports

Reporter: The question of
ties at Washington and Lee has been
up in the air now for quite some

on this matter?

Huntley: | am a member of a fra
ternity at Washington and Lee and
I certainly have no animosity towards
fraternities. | don't believe the

the student body into small groups
which are not related to the academic
pursuits of the school. That, I sup-
pose, is the negative side. Whether
the advantage of fraternity life—social
and otherwise—can be preserved with-
out too much emphasis on the frag-
menting aspect is the major question,
It seems to me they probably can be,
Reporter: What do you feel is the
major purpose of the college president,
besides raising money?

Huntley: That is a very good question,
Raising money is a major function,
but for Washington and Lee it is
harder to answer than it would be
at some schools, and it is good that
it is hard to answer. The bylaws of
the University do entrust most of the
significant decisions, that is those re-
lated to the educational enterprise,
which are certainly the significant de-
cisions, to the faculty with the Board
in ultimate authority. The President
is thought of as acting as a leader of
the faculty, bringing up matters he
feels important, advising when he has
advice to give, stimulating and lead-
ing if necessary faculty committee
activity and maintaining proper liaison
between the faculty and the Board
and the students and the Board. That
is a nebulous task but it seems to
me to be an important one.
Reporter: Do you believe past fund-
raising has been successful, and is
there room for improvement?

Huntley: There is room for improve-
ment, but it has been successful.
Washington and Lee has never be-
come poverty-stricken and it is not
now. That statement would not be
true if fund-raising had not been suc-
cessful in the recent past and over the
long haul. The organization of these
efforts has taken nearly every pattern
you can imagine, depending on the
needs and the times. The president
certainly needs to take a position of
leadership in this area, and our presi-
dents always have, I don’t think Wash-
ington and Lee has ever considered
for a moment abdicating its decision
about its goals to any source of funds,
private or federal. I don't think it
has ever been called upon to do so.

B-ball Team Wins Ninth Straight;
RPI Win Brings Record To 11-1

While most of us were on our way
home for Christmas vacation, the bas-
ketball team was on its way to North
Carolina to continue on its winning
way. They rolled over North Carolina
Methodist 91-71 as Neer lead in
scoring with 20 points. Two days later
they took up where they left off,
beating N.C. Wesleyan 89-61; Cart-
wright led the scoring with 22. The
next night they took on U.N.C. at
Charlotte, the final score; W&L 85,
U.N.C. 65, Cartwright again led the
scorers with 22, With their record 8-1
they went home for a well deserved
rest,

Last week they returned to turn
back a short but scrappy Milligan
team 94-65 and won a re-match with
U.N.C. 91-60. Neer led the scorers
in both contests with 34 and 16
points respectively. Against Milligan
the Generals looked somewhat cold
as they didn’t play a very tight de-
fense in the first half and allowed
Milligan the lead for about the first
ten minutes. By the half the Gen-
erals manged a nine point lead and

in the second half they caught fire

 

and expanded their lead, The Gen-
eral’s big men did a fine job on
offense as Neer got 34, Wesselink 18,
Cartwright 17, and Fauber 9.

Saturday night saw the second
string playing a good portion of the
game as U.N.C. at Charlotte didn’t
provide very good competition. Char-
lie Stone turned in a good perform-
ance at guard collecting 10 points
and setting up some good plays to
the big men. Saturday night was the
General's eighteenth consecutive vic-
tory at home and boosted their sea-
son record to 10-1,

Last night the General’s downed
Richmond Professional Institute for
the second time this season by a score
of 64-46. Wesselink had 18 points
and Neer 16 to lead in the scoring
department.

The Generals have been playing
outstanding ball recently with their
average margin of victory around
twenty points. They are nationally
ranked in both team defense and field
goal percentage. The Generals’ big
men have been doing a fine job
underneath the basket and outside

NOTICE
The home wrestling match previ-
ously scheduled for January 19 has
been changed. The Generals will
entertain the Indians on January 12.

Norwood Morrison, Jody Kline and
John Carrere have been working the
ball well and keeping up a good pres-
sure defense. Reserve guard Bill
Rhyne and Charlie Stone have shown
good speed and agressiveness on de-
fense and have demonstrated their
ability to score when necessary.
Thursday night the Generals take
on Bridgewater College at 8:00 p.m.
in Doremus. This promises to be a

good game as the Eagles defeated
Macon last week. Jim Upperman
and Jay Cook have always been
rough against the Generals and a
good job of defense will be necessary
to win this one. The attendance at
the last two home games has been
low (606 and 542); it is hoped that
more people will be able to find time
to support the Generals Thursday
night.

 

 

Player of

Too often in evaluating
the performances of a bas-
ketball player the scoring
average is the only criteria
applied. Overloked are such
things as turnovers, assists,
defense and rebounding
which can make or break a
team effort. On the basis of
these vital but un-noticed
qualities in a ballplayer, this
week’s Player of the Week
is Mel Cartwright.

Mel is currently leading
the team in rebounding and
is tied for the lead in assists
(Jody Kline is the other
leader). Mel is one of the
most unselfish people ever
to step foot in Doremus
Gymnasium as he is con-
stantly passing up the “good
shot” in order to give some-
one else a better one. Mel’s
scoring average has stayed
about the same although he
is taking fewer shots per
game. Mel exemplifies the
true team player as he is
constantly foregoing per-
sonal glory for the more im-
portant goal — a winning
team.

BITS AND PIECES

By RIC BERARD

Whoever is responsible for the
installation of the complete arc-light-
ing system for the basketball court,
the new metal stands and the renova-
tions of the handball courts deserves
the thanks of all the W&L community.
These improvements, following the
new scoreboards and refurbished pool,
really brighten up the place. Now all
we need....

ae at ak

I was watching a football game on
TV the other day, and I couldn't get
over the bush-league performances of
the supposed “star” on one of the
teams every time a penalty was called
against himself or his team. Nothing
is more ridiculous than to see a
“class” ballplayer hurt himself and
his team by hamming protests to the
officials. While not every call by an
official is going to be the right one,
making an exaggerated protest to all
humanity about every penalty only
detracts from the ballplayer. Fortu-
nately, we don’t have anyone at W&L
like that yet, although it’s an easy
habit to fall into.

of ak *

If there is one wish I have for the
new year in terms of W&L athletics,
it is that Coach Mac “Nubie” Mc-
Laughlin devote his full time and
activities to instilling an increased
sense of pride and initiate a period
of growth across the board in W&L
athletics. When Coach Mac assumes
his new position as Director of
Athletics next fall, I seriously question
that he is going to have the time to
perform as well as he would want
to the duties of both head football
coach and Director of Athletics.

At W&L, athletics are a potential
source of great school pride, and,
with the change of administrations
within the Doremus staff, I hope seri-
ous consideration is given to answer-
ing this need. However, in spite of the
best of intentions, an effective job
cannot be done by only off-season
attention to the task ahead.

* * &*

Finally, | believe that in the com-
ing year one of the most noble uses
ever made of athletics will be wit-
nessed this summer in Mexico City
when the United States’ Olympic
teams find that America is indeed a
bi-racial society that cannot perform
at its maximum unless all its minori-
ties work as one. Should America’s
dynamic essence as a “melting pot”
be disavowed because of a color bias?
I think not; I believe the reason will
be made abundantly clear in Mexico,

Thursday's address to Omicron
Delta Kappa by former Vice-Presi-

overflow crowd,
officials have arranged
modate in Lee Chapel.

The entire address will be relayed |

to the Chapel, where it will be broad-
cast over the public address system.
The public, which is invited, will
be asked to adjourn to the Chapel,

dent body and administration.
Arrangements are being worked
out whereby all visitors will be in-
vited to Doremus Gym for the less
formal question-and-answer session
with Mr. Nixon following his speech.
Broadcast and print news media
from Virginia have indicated they will
cover the speech in depth, although
Mr. Nixon is not expected to make
a major announcement. Advance

All-CAC Team
For Football

(Continued from page 3)

Centre’s Jack Smith and Washing-
ton’s Ed Kelly each got three votes at
tackle, to be selected along with
WA&L’s unanimous pick Thompson.

The All-CAC defensive backfield
includes five players, instead of the
usual three. Washington’s fine safety
Sam Williams poled three votes to
lead the bunch, but four others—the
Bears’ Jeff Jones, W&L’s Charlie
Freret, Southwestern’s Sam Cooper,
and Sewanee’s Jim Beene—tied with
two ballots each.

A strange situation developed at
end, where Sewanee’s versatile two-
way star Mike Knickelbine got a single
vote on the offensive platoon and two
on the defensive unit. He was placed
on the defensive team because he
drew more votes there.

Offensive Team

Ends—Boon (Sewanee) and Arnold
(Southwestern); Tackles—-Thompson
(Washington and Lee), Smith (Centre),
and Kelly (Washington); Guards—
Sheehan (Sewanee) and Thompson
(Centre); Center—Underwood (Sewa-
nee); Backs—Boone (Centre), La-
monica (Centre), McKean (Southwest-
ern, Gignilliat (Sewanee).

Defensive Team

Ends—Mackenzie (Washington and

Who does not recall that famous meeting between Mr.
Arthur and Louis Napoleon when Mr. Arthur said, “Lou,
I wish I hadn’t of repealed 1874!’ Whereupon the French
emperor made his immortal rejoinder, “Tipi que nous et
tyler tu’’. Well sir, they had many a good laugh about that,

as you can imagine. )

But I digress. How can we remember to write 1968 on
our papers and letters? Well sir, the best way is to find
something memorable about 1968, something unique to fix
it firmly in your mind. Happily, this is very simple be-
cause, as we all know, 1968 is the first year in history that

is divisible by 2, by 5, and by 7. Take a

pencil and try it:

1968 divided by 2 is 984; 1968 divided by 5 is 393%; 1968

divided by 7 is 281!

occur again until the year 2079, but we will all be so busy

then celebrating the Chester A.

Nixon Outlines Goals, Problems Of U.S.;
Remains Noncommittal OnfHis Candidacy

Former Vice President Richard M.
Nixon was the guest speaker at the
Omicron Delta Kappa leadership fra-
ternity “tapping” day Thursday.

In a speech delivered in Doremus
Gymnasium, Nixon cited current
domestic problems which have led
to violence in cities and curbs in
American foreign spending.

Without an American anti-com-
munist stand in the world, Nixon
told the audience, other nations in the
free world could not “afford the
luxury of neutrality.”

“America needs the vision, the dis-
sent, the constructive action this gen-
eration will provide for in the years
ahead,” Nixon said to students in
closing his remarks.

Nixon fielded questions, mostly
political, from students following his
speech.

Tuesday night the Executive Com-
mittee voted 9-0 to recommend that
the Southern Collegian be resub-
sidized under the conditions of the
motion introduced by Wick Vellines,
senior representative.

Steve Saunders, editor of the maga-
zine which has been an off-campus
publication since 1966, said that only
effective policies of the Publications
Board are needed to maintain the
necessary standards of good taste.

The main points of the proposal
are as follows:

1. The Publications Board will
choose the editor from written
application after a faculty ad-
viser (Mr. H. Robert Huntley,
assistant professor of English)

On the question of the future of
the U. S. in Europe, he said the
fundamental new approach to Ameri-

economic self interest. The military
future of NATO, Nixon said, is “very

Peace in the Middle East will be
possible if the U. S. and other powers
see that Israel maintains a balance of
power against the aggressive nations
in that area. Nixon also cited the re-
armament of Arab nations by the
Soviet Union.

Nixon further suggested that the
U. S. halt all economic aid to the
United Arab Republic until it changes

in response to a question, is to “win
something,” Nixon said.

If he becomes a candidate, he said
this could be done by winning as
many primaries as possible.

The Republican Party, Nixon said,
has a “better than even chance” to
win the presidency in November
against the Democratic nominee, who-
ever he is.

On the credibility gap, Nixon said
a great number of Americans do not
believe the government. But a more
serious problem, he added, is that
“the enemy in North Vietnam and
the Soviets and Chinese have some

doubts about the determination of
the United States to see this (the war
in Vietnam) through.”

Nixon then repeated his statement
that he would make no statement
which might lead Hanoi to delay any
peace efforts until after the election
in November. The U. S. should pre-
sent a united front to the world on
the war in Vietnam.

Nixon flew into the Roanoke air-
port late Thursday morning. His visit
at W&L was limited to a speech in
Doremus Gymnasium. Immediately
following his speech and question

 

period, Nixon left the campus.

 

Camera crews from all three major

television networks were on hand for

Nixon's speech. However, only ABC-TV showed the speech on its 6:30 p.m.
newseast that night. The film showed Nixon shaking hands with Acting-Presi-
dent William Pusey and then showed Nixon answering a question on improv-
ing his “loser’s image.” A closing comment by the reporter allowed several

students to make their television debuts.

The ‘Collegian’ Again

If the founders of The Southern Collegian one hundred
years ago had foreseen all the trouble their offspring was going
to cause, they would have undoubtedly killed it on the spot.
In fact, everyone assumed that it was thoroughly dead after
March 1966, when the faculty cut off its funds and university
approval, thereby effectively banishing it from the W&L
scene. Not that anyone really cared: ‘The South’s Most
Maligned Magazine” had come a long way from the literary
journal it had been in 1868, and thoroughly deserved abolition.

Still, old institutions die hard, and the Southern Collegian
stripped of all its associations with the University—has ling-
ered on under private management for the past two years.
Now, in its hundredth year, it is making a bid for a new lease
on respectability, assisted last Tuesday night by a unanimous
EC resolution advising that the University once again subsidize
the publication.

Mindful of the Collegian’s past troubles with sex, sadism,
and satire, the resolution provides for four checks on the
content of a new Collegian:

(1) The Publications Board will choose the editor
from written application after a faculty adviser
(probably from the English department) has
limited the number to no less than two candi-
dates.

(2) The magazine’s renewal of funds will be on a
yearly basis.

(3) The new editor will outline the magazine's
format each year to the faculty.

Underlying these points is the assumption that the Publica-
tions Board (which consists of the editors and business man-
agers of the Ring-tum Phi, the Calyx, and Ariel, plus two
faculty members) will exercise a close supervision over any
objectionable elements in the Collegian, just as it presently
does over all student publications.

The EC’s action is, of course, only a recommendation. It
remains for the faculty to come to a final decision on the
matter of restoring University subsidization. In doing so, we
hope it will take into consideration the following points:

oe kK

The continuing existence of the shadow Collegian over
the past two years argues for the presence of some feeling
on campus in favor of maintaining a campus magazine. Further,
the Collegian of the past two years has been refreshingly free
from the hard-core pornography which characterized the
Hairy Collegian, despite the fact that there have been no
other controls upon its content than the discretion and taste
of the staff. A “clean” Collegian is possible.

The old Collegian got out of hand because it was
permitted to do so. The Publications Board in theory possessed
the same powers of censure over it as over any other student
publication, but in fact chose not to exercise this power over
an institution whose character had gradually become fixed
by custom. Any new Collegian, apart from voluntary self-
discipline on the part of the staff, would be subject to the
same rigorous supervision which the Publication Board has
always effectively exercised over, for example, the Ring-tum

Phi.

The Publications Board’s censure would be given muscle

by the EC’s suggestion that the magazine’s renewal of funds |

be on a vearly basis ( pornt number two above). If the maga-

vine staff were to ignore the reprimands of the Publication | *
| that professors who are truly devoted |

Board consistently, it could be reminded that its existence 1s
only provisional.

Given these safeguards against mishandling of the maga-
i.e., a firm Publications Board, financial control in the
the EC’s other pro-

ine,
hands of the faculty, and self-discipline
posals (one and three above) would seem to be unnecessary
is well as foolish. Concerning selection of the editor from
candidates approved by a faculty member, it should be obvious
that this would be a potentially dangerous situation, virtually
superseding the Publications Board as it does. The faculty and
idministration of Washington and Lee have not felt it necessary
in the past to interfere directly or indirectly in the selection of
sudent editors and officers, and it hardly seems necessary to
begin now, even in the case of that bugbear, the Collegian.
As

or the Supt gre stion that the faculty approve the magazine S
format each year, we find that impractical if not downright

the inclination to examine every issuc ot the Collegian in

idvance. The only body to which this task could possibly be
issigene d—assuming that suc h a thing could ever be considered
necessary——would again be the Publications Board

Wi commend the Et for encouraging the re establishment
of the Southern Collegian, although we hardly agree with the
evere and (as we believe) unnecessarily restrictive terms of

its recommendations to the faculty And we recommend to the

Professor Emeritus Designed Key

 

Mr. Latture Relives ODK Founding

By REED BYRUM

As Omicron Delta Kappa, National
Leadership Fraternity for College
Men, inducted its fifty-fourth class
of initiates, one man in_ particular
watched with an especial interest in
his heart and mind: he is indeed
one of the original founders of the
Alpha Circle of ODK, which is locat-
ed upon the Washington and Lee
campus, Rupert Nelson Latture.

Along with fifteen others, includ-
ing members of the student body and
faculty, Mr. Latture was of primary
importance in establishing the ideals
and principles of what is now the
most respected and honored leader-
ship fraternity in the nation.

duction for this season. The trio,
which has received enthusiastic re-
sponse all over Europe an dthe United
States, offered an outstanding selction
of duo and trio repertoire for piano,
clarinet, and violin or viola,

Ihe performance was characterized
throughout by the flawless technical
skill and precision of the artists. Dif-
fficult passages were exectued fault-
lessly, and, at the same time, the
players managed to convey a sense
of musical warmth and feeling ofr
their music.

The program opened with Mozart's
“Trio in E flat Major” (viola, clarinet,
and piano), followed by Debussy’s
“Premiere Rhapsody” for clarinet and
piano. The first half of the program
ended with “Suite de Concert (1936)"
(violin, clarinet, and piano) by Milh-
aud, an unusual selection which pro-
vided a_ spirited contrast to the
first two compositions.

The second half of

David And Lisa

By CHIP HARRIS

“David and Lisa,” an award win
ning film Frank Perry,
will be shown this Sunday at 6:30
p.m. in duPont Auditorium. The film
is the third in a series of six notable
productions presented through “Focus
on the Flm,” a program made possible
through the University Federation of
Christian Concern.

The film, which premiered in 1963,
concerns the lives of two mentally dis-
turbed teenagers staying at a private
institution for mentally ill high-school-
age students outside Philadelphia.

David, a highly intelligent
brought up by domineering and
aspiring mother and a social mis
fited, dominated father, is so fearful
of death that he breaks down if any
one much touches him. Lisa
on the other hand, is afraid to con-
front reality, having apparently lack-
ed any form of parental love during
her younger years. Consequently, she
hides behind a of childlike

The difference is probably due to the
problem of balance between the bril-

of the viola, the sound of which is
always more restrained.

Blue Annexes Tenth Straight Win

 

Generals Smother Bri

By THUNDER THORNTON

Washington and Lee’s tall, talented
Generals handed Bridgewater an 86-
74 defeat at Doremus Gymnasium
rhursday night, and thereby strength-
ened their standing atop the Virginia
Small College League totem-pole. By
winning, W&L saw its mark raised
to 12-1, and kept their state record
unblemished.

The Eagles, a solid team that re-
fused to let the Generals pull away
until late in the game, got strong
scoring from Eddie Cook, Jim Upper-
man, and Rick Wampler, but it was
not destined to be enough. The home
team performed excellently before a
large crowd, and although a few cold
spells and turnovers by W&L allowed
Bridgewater to mount a few come-
backs from time to time ,the Gen-
erals played nothing but class ball
when it counted.

“Magic of Old”

Pacing the victors was Mel Cart-
wright, who treated the fans to the
“magic” of old. Working in a low
post for the most part, the sophomore
star whirled past his defenders with
the fluid moves that marked his fresh-
man season. Despite a finger injury

one-handed to tally 27 points and pull
in 12 rebounds,

With Cartwright leading the way,
the Generals shot out to a 16-4 early
lead and then watched Upperman
and Co, whittle it down. The Eagles
were forced to shoot from outside
over the tight W&L defense, but they
made enough long ones to cut the
deficit to 39-36 at the intermission.
Upperman, the visitors’ big man, was
responsible for 13 points, keeping
pace with Cartwright and keeping his
team in the game.

The second half saw the home
forces steadily pull away and avoid
the long cold spell that would make
a Bridgewater comeback possible. The
Generlas displayed their strength in-
side with Cartwright, Mike Neer, and
Mal Wesselink working effectively at
both ends of the court. The Eagles
began finding it tougher to get a
good shot and almost impossible to
get a second one. Washington and
Lee moved out to a nine point spread
at 47-38, watched it melt to 49-45,
and then zoomed off to a sixteen point
bulge at 68-52 on a brilliant drive by
guard John Carrere.

Alford, the Buccaneer's

challenge for the Generals’ Mike
Neer. Alford is only a mediocre
shooter, but his rebounding has been

instrumental in ECC’s success. This
will mark the first time Neer has
faced a competent big man; and

the resulting match-up will be well
worth watching.

The big weakness of this Pirate
team lies on defense. ECC has had
terrible difficulties in containing their
opponents. At the end of their first
six games, they ranked in the
Southern Conference in defense. This
is primarily due to a lack of cohesion,
however, as only two of the starting

five lettered last year. One of the
pair, forward Vince Colbert, honor
able mention All-Conference last
year, is beginning to lend that needed

W&L forecourt men passed off like
guards. A beautiful feed from Cart-

lead to 82-66 before a final Bridge-

Stop Eaglettes

Coach Tom Davies finally saw his
ball-control offense jell last night as
Washington and Lee’s Baby Gen-
erals clipped Bridgewater’s Eaglettes
65-51 in Doremus Gymnasium.

This was the Little Blue’s second
straight win of a season that opened
with four consecutive losses, and it
avenged an earlier loss to the same
Bridgewater five.

“Defense won the game for us,”
Coach Davies commented. “We held
their two top scorers to a total of
eight points, and one of them was
held scoreless.”

Four of the W&L freshmen posted
double-figure scoring marks for the
contest. They were led by Rich Mur-
ray, who had 15 points. Following
him were Mike Truta with 13, Neil
Robinson with 12, and Bill Bauer
with 10 markers.

Balanced scoring has been a key

The Generals’ performance should
serve as a warning to prospective foes.
Washington and Lee handled the
Eagles, who were coming off a high
scoring, big margin win over Lynch-
burg, with the dexterity of a champ-
ion. W&L shot a healthy 54% from
the floor, due largely to the fact that
the pinpoint passes of Kline, Carrere,
and Cartwright earned a lot of easy
baskets. On the other hand, Bridge-
water could manage only a 34% mark
against the Big Blue, with a majority

proposal designed to fulfill the parts
of the Self-Study dealing with health
and safety. Earlier, the idea of re-
quired inspection of apartments had
been proposed. Both the EC and the
IFC opposed this and formed a sub-
committee consisting of Nash, Ellis
Zahras, William Schildt, and Peter
Kintz.

This group drafted a new plan in
which W&L would establish such an
investigation service and would print
a list of those dwellings inspected
and approved. However, inspection is
not mandatory and must be both
requested by the student, his parents,
or the landlord, and must be per-
mitted by the landlord.

The EC, in passing this motion
9-0, unanimously agreed that it both
fulfilled the University’s responsibility
and insured the students of free
choice.

The writer of the letter also stated
that he disagreed “with the majority
of Mr. Nixon's political views.” In
addition, he said he would welcome
a student peace reaction if directed
“within the boundaries of good taste.”
This includes discussing the issues in-
teligently instead of resorting to “pro-
pogating offensive literature.”

A number of student publications
and WLUR had tried to obtain in-
terviews with Nixon, but his tight

' schedule at W&L did not allow time.

Several posters were put up on
campus by students. One read “Nixon

Turnovers and Charity Misses

Turovers in the secnd-half, and a
so-so night from the foul line marred
the home team’s performance some-
what. While the Generals could net
only 16 for 26 from the charity line,
Bridgewater cashed in on 16 for 21.
Washington and Lee outgoaled Brige-
water from the field 35-29, and that
was the point spread.

Joining Cartwright in double figures
for W&L were Neer with 21, Carrere
with 10, and Wesselink with 10.
Upperman paced the losers with 21,
while Cook and Wampler added 17
apiece.

against Bridgewater may not overly

Greek letters. I then presented this
to the group at our next meeting,
and it was readily accepted.

R-+t P: At its conception did you
ever perceive that ODK would eventu-
ally become of such national signific-
ance? Also, how did you branch out
to your other 114 chapters?

Latture: Neither I nor the other
member of the society ever realized
the national importance involved in
our founding of ODK; no one be-
lieved that ODK would extend into
over one hundred colleges and uni-
versities throughout the country.
The second circle was founded at

two former students, all of whom

academic requirements higher. It still

of campus concern.

A View From The Footbridge

(Continued on page 4)
it was to watch W&L’s second string
trounce UNC Charlotte by 31 points?
Granted, there has been some excite-
ment, an example being last night's
Bridgewater contest, but, on the
whole, the W&L student body has
not seen the caliber of competition
which most want to see so as to
answer that all important question
that is floating around campus these
days, “Just how good are we?”

It is this columnist’s opinion that
the Generals are good, and in the
course of the following two months,
in places like Greenville, North Car-
olina, and Norfolk and Salem, Vir-
ginia, this observation will be proven
true. This, though, will be only small
consolation to the W&L student body,
who, though seeing home victories,
will be seeing few, if any, mean-
ingful ones.

Obviously, nothing can be done
this season to remedy the situation.
That was irrevocably fixed last spring
when the powers-that-be in the
Athletic Department arranged this
year’s schedule. I have a few sug-
gestions, though, that I believe would
immensely improve the outlook for
the student body in the realm of
basketball spectatorship.

Over the years, Washington and Lee
has developed healthy rivalries with
several other Virginia small colleges.
Only one of them, Roanoke, appears
on the schedule this year. I feel that

Wrestling very smartly, Dave Hig-
gins easily beat his man 7-0 in the
167 pound class. Danny Webster had
no trouble at all as he received a
forfeit in the 177 pound bout, giving
the Generals six more points. Jay
Clarke wrapped up a good evening
for the Generals as he destroyed his
much heavier RPI opponent 8-0.

leadership now, and is largely re-
sponsible for the Buccaneers’ recent
improvement.

Saturday night should prove a stiff
test for the Generals. W&L has not
yet faced a team of East Carolina's

calibre and the game is on ECC’s|%

home court. The Pirates have the
height advantage and an explosive

offense. In the words of Coach Tom :

Quinn before the season, “This could
be the most surprising and exciting
team that ever donned the ‘Jolly
Roger’.” Washington and Lee's 12-1
record and convincing margins of

victory are nothing to sneer at, though, | ¥

and it could be the Pirates who'll
be surprised.

Macon, Hampden-Sydney, and Roa-
noke would be advantageous to all
the schools involved, and would
greatly enhance W&L’s seasons to
come. Nothing picks up school spirit
like traditional rivals, and I feel it’s
about time these were exploited on
the basketball court.

Secondly, I believe a path has to
be cleared between Lexington, Vir-
ginia, and Monteagle, Tennessee,
home of the Sewanee Purple Tigers.
There is no reason that the old-
standing feud that exists between the

David and Lisa
Shown Sunday

(Continued from page 2)

but striking scene of her clinging to
a statue of a mother fondly embrac-
ing her child in the Philadelphia
Museum. From this and Lisa’s over-
all behavior the viewer must form
his own conclusions.

This contrast of presentation serves
to underscore the contrast of their
mental disturbances and backgrounds,
and the resulting salvation they find
in each other is just paradoxical
enough to really reach the viewer.

Kiev Dulla is excellent in portray-
ing a withdrawn, perpetually fearful
David, overcoming the difficulty in
changing from one instant a relatively
complacent David to seconds later a
violent, extremely perturbed, David.
Lisa, also a difficult character to
portrary, is played by Janet Margolin,
who is equally adapted to the role.

Few black and white films, or for
that matter, few color films, ever

 

reach the level of films like “David
and Lisa.” “David and Lisa” is well
worth the trek to duPont Hall Sun-
day night.

 

two schools should be limited in
basketball to the luck-of-the-draw
chance that they might meet each
year. The W&L-Sewanee game should
become a regularly scheduled annual
affair.

A Shift in Direction

Finally, I propose a “shift in di-
rection” as far as basketball schedul-
ing is concerned. Let’s get out of the
Carolinas and into the Baltimore-D.C.
area. The Wesleyans and the Metho-
dists aren’t worth the expense of
traveling that far (one game on the
recent Carolina trip was played be-
fore 50 people in a high school gym).
Catholic U., Towson, Johns Hopkins,
and Mt. St. Mary’s—small colleges
all—are the kinds of teams the Gen-
erals should be playing and playing
regularly.

It doesn’t take major college opposi-
tion to make for exciting basketball.
Winston-Salem, Evansville, and Ken-
tucky Wesleyan play the game better
than most big schools in the nation.
The Washington and Lee student body
deserves to see its team matched
against the caliber of small-college
Opposition that makes for champ-
ions. We have faith in our Generals.
Bring on the best!

Ryder, Duchin, And Five
Entertain For Fancy Dress

Fancy Dress, one of the most popu-
lar and most famous party weekends
in the South, will take place this
year on February 2-3. Highligthing
the weekend will be the Friday after-
noon cocktail party, the Fancy Dress
Ball Friday evening, and an evening
concert Saturday.

The cocktail party will take place
in the basement of the Mayflower
Motel from 4 to 6 p.m., and the
Parliaments and the Fabulous Five
will provide their always popular
brand of entertainment.

rhe Parliaments had one of the
top soul records of 1967 with their
release entitled “I Wanna Testify.”
Refreshments will be either a variety
of mixed drinks or delightful Play-
boy Punch directly from Hugh Hefner
& Co, in Chicago.

Topping off the afternoon festivi-
ties will be an enticing ‘suprise’ from
Roanoke which should be well worth
everyone’s undivided attention.

 

Peter Duchin

Students To Direct
Troubadour Plays

the Troubadour Theatre has two
more major productions scheduled for
the remainder of the academic year.
In March Wycherley’s “A Country
Wife” will be presented in three acts
under student direction. In May two
new one-act plays will be produced.

One of the one-act plays was writ-
ten by Scott Miller, a 1967 graduate
of W&L. The other play has not
been decided yet. Last May, Miller
wrote and directed the one-act, “In
Which The Parsinant Flies.”

In addition to the above produc-
tions, the Troubadours will partici-
pate in the state one-act play contest

at the University of Virginia on
February 17.
The Troubadours have presented

two theatrical productions this year.
the first one, Boris Vian's “The
Empire Builders,” was a three act play
in November. The play had been per-
formed only once before in the United
States.

Their second major production was
“The Caucasian Chalk Circle” by
Bertolt Brecht, The play, produced in

December, had one of the largest
casts ever to appear in a Troub
production

 

 

The internationally famous Peter
Duchin Orchestra will again perform
at the Fancy Dress Ball Friday eve-
ning in what promises to be enjoy-
able time for all. Peter Duchin has
played at several of President John-
son’s parties and also performed at
Lynda Johnson's wedding reception.

The Ball will begin at 9 p.m. with
‘The Figure’ which is a presentation
of the president and vice-presidents
of the Dance Board and their dates.
The theme of the dance will be “High
Society.”

Again the dress will be tuxedo or
fully formal dress of tails. This man-
ner of attire proved popular last year
so that the Dance Board decided to
continue it this year. In previous
years, Fancy Dress has been high-
lighted by the wearing of gay colonial
and royal costumes, but many students
complained of the high costs and the
shabby condition of the outfits.

The Ball will take place in Evans
Dining Hall which will be decorated
with a large garden and fountain in
the middle of the floor which will be
lighted with blue lights to provide
a true atmosphere of high society.

Mitch Ryder

The Mitch Ryder Revue will per-
form from 8 to 10 p.m. in Doremus

Gymnasium on Saturday. Mitch
Ryder is a “blue-eyed soul brother”
whose repertoire includes mostly

rhythm and blues, but he is capable

South Carolina Senator

Will Speak On

Senator Strom Thurmond, the
senior senator from South Carolina
and a leader in the Republican party

in the South, will speak in Lee
Chapel on February 20. The Young
Republicans will sponsor the Lee

Chapel speech and the South Carolina
Delegation will host a dinner in honor
of the senator at Evans Dining Hall.

rhe filet mignon dinner is open to
the public and the cost will be
minimal according to delegation chair-
man Joe Wilson. The South Caro-
lina auxiliary delegations at Hollins,
Mary Baldwin, Sweet Briar and Ran-
dolph-Macon are planning to attend
the dinner and speech.

Presidential Race
In 1948 Thurmond ran for Presi-
dent as a States’ Rights Democrat
carrying four states and winning 39
electoral votes. He also was the first
person ever elected to a major office
in a write-in campaign, (U.S, Senate,
1954) he delivered the longest speech
in U.S. Senate history (24 hours and
18 minutes on June 17, 1957), and
in 1964 he took the fateful step of
switching to the Republican party in
a Democrat state, but in 1966 was
re-elected sweeping all counties ex-

cept one as a Republican.

Past Positions

He has served as a teacher, county
superintendent of education, city and
county attorney, and in all three

 

W&L Campus

branches of the state government—
as state senator, circuit judge, and
governor of South Carolina 1947-51.
Today the Senator is a major gen-
eral in the army reserve, and is the
ranking reserve officer in the United
States Congress. He has served as na-
tional president of the Reserve Officers
Association and the Military Govern-
ment Association.

The Senator won particular dis-
tinction in the Senate during 1961
and 1962 in his fight against what
he has described as the State De-
partment’s “no-win” foreign policy
in the cold war and the muzzling of
military officers in their anti-com-
munist statements, troop education
programs and cold war seminars for
reservists and the public, After ex-
posing the now-famous Fulbright
Memorandum, which urged curtail-
ment of information on communism
to the military and the public, the
Senator won an investigation by a
special Senate subcommittee on mili
tary speech censorship and cold war
education activities.

Committee Assignments
He serves on the Commerce and
Armed Services Committees, two of
the most important committees in the
Senate. On Commerce, he is chair-
man of the subcommittee which is
concerned with all surface transporta-

Contact Offers A Varied Fare
To Analyze Grand Old Party

Morton

Iruston B. Morton, the proverb-
ally unbeatable Republican Senator
from Kentucky, will open Contact
by speaking on the topic of rights and
duties of the opposition party. An in-
sight into the present administration’s
internal conflict over Viet Nam policy
is also expected.

Morton’s three Congessional and
two Senatorial victories mark a dis-
tinct break from his home state’s
traditional support of the Democratic

Party. While serv-

ing his first sena-
Behind

torial term in 1958,
after heavy G.O.P.
Contact losses that year,
Morton was asked by President Eisen-
hower to head the Republican Na-
tional Committee. His outstanding
performance in this position was re-
warded by his acquisition of the
Chairmanship of the Republican Na-
tional Campaign Committee. Morton
also served as Permanent Chairman
of the 1964 Republican National
Convention.

Morton’s recent denunciation of the
Johnson Administration's Vietnam
policy was not unexepcted in view
of his predictably liberal views on
foreign policy. It will be interesting
however, to discover how he recon-
ciles this position with the philosophy
of bi-partisanship that has been the
corner stone of the detente between
the Republican and Democratic Part-
ies in the sphere of international re-
lations,

A seventh generation Kentuckian,
Morton entered Congress for the first
time in 1946 after first serving over
four years in the Navy in the Pacific
theatre and a short term as president
of Ballard and Ballard Company in
Louisville.

Morton was elected U. S. Repre-
sentative from the Third Kentucky
District for two more terms before
being appointed in 1953 as Assistant
Secretary of State for Congressional
Relations by President Eisenhower.
He resigned this post in 1956 and
defeated incumbent Democratic Sen-
ate Whip Earl Clements by a small

majority for his first seat in the
upper house.

Morton is presently the second-
ranking Republican on the Senate;

also to the powerful Senate Finance

Lubell

Samuel Lubell brings to “What’s
New, Pachyderm?” a perceptive mind
and keen sensibility sharpened by
many years of close contact with the
American voter, He is, as one ob-
server called him, “an interviewer
par excellence.” He says of his work,
“I try to make my stories representa-
tive of the talk going on in the
country among people themselves. As
people read my stories | want them to
know and say to themselves, “That's
how I feel,” or, “That sounds just
like that fool | was arguing with
the other day!”

Savoring Vagaries

Lubell is a man who savors the
vagaries of the political scene. In
“When People Speak” he quotes a
man he once talked to in Houston.
Asked who he supported for Presi-
dent, the man replied, “I ain't voted
since they shot Huey Long. He was
my man.”

Lubell, who will speak Saturday,
February 10, at Lee Chapel, was born
in Poland in 1911. He and his parents
migrated to America just a few
months before World War | engulfed

Eastern Europe.
More

He attended eve-
Ideas ning classes at the

College of the City

Behind of New York and
graduated from
Contact the School of

Journalism at Columbia in 1933. He
was a Pulitzer Travelling Scholar in
Europe in 1934. He soon got a job
with the Long Island Daily Press and
then found his way to the Wash-
ington area where he worked for the
Washington Post, moved south for a
while to write for the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, and then returned to
D.C. and a position with the Wash-
ington Herald.

Experience in the governmental
field came with jobs with the Office
of Facts and Figures and the Office
of War Information, Later he worked
with Bernard M. Baruch on the
Baruch Committee and was executive

assistant to him on his war time
reports, among them the Survey on
Post-War Reconstruction and Eco-
nomic Policies.

War Correspondent

Lubell was a war correspondent in
the China-Burma-India-Theatre in the
closing days of World War IL.
Later he saw first hand the destruction
of Europe as a correpnodent for the
Providence Journal and North Ameri-
can Newspaper Alliance.

Lubell has been involved with
political writing ever since Roose
velt’s third term. He has done depth
of the elections of 1948,
1950, 1952, 1954, 1956, and 1958
In recent years he has been carried

In a recent New York Times Book

praised the thoroughness with which
Hess and Broder examined the Re-

ticularly in their 50-state survey of
the party's standing, the authors tell
the average reader more than he
may want to know about the Re-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Not an ‘either-or’ matter

We don’t like to give more publicity than we must to Mr.
Dunbar’s Friday Protest against conventional dress and against
teachers who want to see it observed (inasmuch as that protest
differs from his Thursday Protest against Richard Nixon, and
from the protest we half expect him to launch tomorrow
against the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi). But on the other
hand we can’t see ourself
allowing to pass unchalleng-
ed what we feel is a series of
gross public misrepresenta-
tions of this University’s
character.

We agree that students
ought to enter this Univer-
sity prepared—for conven-
tional dress, for the Honor
System, and for everything
else they accepted by impli-
cation when they accepted

 

 

an offer to matriculate at
Washington and Lee. We
thought the point had been
driven into the ground, but apparently it requires further
reiteration: one among the myriad things that set this Uni-

ROBERT IL. DUNBAR

versity above so many others is the ability of students (most
students, anyway) to come to classes prepared AND dressed
respectably, respectfully. Mr. Dunbar asks in his letter, “Which
should be emphasized the lust for knowledge or a tie and
jacket?” To most of us, it is not an “‘either-or’’ situation.

We are glad that Mr. Dunbar, in arguing this matter, is
once again in a minority. So many students have signed for
Professor Colvin’s courses next semester(and none of them
are “gut” courses) that two of them had to be closed, an|
unprecedented action. The implication is that these many |
students accept, among other things, the terms of sartorial |

 

appearance in class as outlined in Dr. Colvin’s letter to this |
newspaper. Closing courses is itself far from good, but it does |
serve in this instance as an indication that many, many people
do not fear the prospect of being encouraged to wear a coat

and tie and shoes and socks to class, and going to class pre- ‘

pa red as well,

 

A valid need for valid data

Everybody's avocation in recent years has been knocking
McCormick Library: “books are too old,” “books are poorly
selected,” “books are far too few in number.” The Ring-tum
Phi, even under current proprietorship, has engaged upon
occasion in library-attacking. Most fashionable of late has been
the Statistical Comparison With Other Colleges, with vary-
ing sub-themes—the Budgetary Analysis, the Sex-Cage En-
quiry, the Median-Age-of-Books Tabulation, and so forth.
Conclusions have been uniformly damning. While we hasten
to say that we aren’t claiming everything is fine and dandy, we
would like to suggest the outlines of possible future investiga-
tion which might show that ours is not the Black Hole Of ALL
College Libraries.

First, somebody preferably a critic who has made Statisti-
c al investigations ot this sort before —could survey other col-
leges to see not how many books they own but rather how
many are available for use. We were surprised at Christmas-
time when we spent several days in Yale’s Sterling Memorial
Library, which owns 4,826,148 volues and spent $3,029,624
last year. Because books are circulated for three months at a
time at Yale, and probably for others, less obvious reasons as
well, though books are almost unbelievably unavailable there.
his is a chronic condition, say dissatisfied Yalies—and by
empirical testing, we found that more books on randomly
selected topics were available in every instance in McCormick
than at Yale. If a library is to be used—that is, if books are
to be available to undergaduates rather than just owned
then perhaps we aren't quite so poorly off here as some.

lo the people who compile figures on the number of
acquisitions elsewhere: tor the sake of validity, why not try
avoiding universities with graduate schools, or at least books
acquired specifically for graduate-school libraries within other
universities ¢ And please avoid counting duplic ate copies
needed and bought by huge universities when we buy only one
to satisfy the same need. Acquiring a volume written in Ra-
jasthani (and there are books in that language) might hill a
need at Yale, but probably wouldn't here. Yale might need
ind buy fen copies ot that book and thereby increase it Ac quis

$50,000 War A gainst Poverty
Waged By Reverend Brown

By LARRY HONIG
|

In his muted brown sportcoat and |
clerical collar, Tom Brown sips coffee |
and talks leisurely in the Co-op with
students. Five minutes later, he walks
the icy cement to be with the children
of Rockbridge County’s poorest fam-
ilies.

For Rev, J. Thompson Brown,
Assistant Rector of the R. E. Lee
Memorial Church, working in con-
trasts is a way of life. Those people
in his congregation and those he meets
as Episcopal Chaplain to Washington
and Lee are only a part of his con-
cern,

—

Brown also directs the Rockbridge
Area Community Action Council,
whose annual budget of $50,000
finances a hefty poverty program in
the Lexington area.

Facing the Problems
The Council was formed 15 months
ago by interested county residents to
study local problems—educational
level of citizens, employment, hous-
ing, job discrimination—and then to

try to do something about it.
Because of the reduction in federal
expenditures on poverty programs,
the local group had to give up plans
of independent government financing
and joined the Roanoke-based TAP
program (Total Action against Pov-
erty), from which most of the funds

are received,
In the Neighborhoods
With professional aid from TAP,

the Council began work on Brown's |
assumption that the poor ($3,000 an- |
nual income for a family of four)
“had the innate human to

resources

 

| better

their way of life.”

The immediate result, in March of
last year, was a program of neigh-
borhood development whose goal was
to allay the depressed attitude of the
poor. Five neighborhood workers,
classified as poor themselves, were
hired for $3,600 to meet once a week
with their peers for training and dis-
cussion of common problems.

Before School

A result of the rapid growth of
the poverty program was the recent
formulation of a Day Care Center
and a Child Care Center. The Day
Care Center is a kindergarten for poor
children, the regulations for which
are set by the Office of Economic
Opportunity (which finances TAP).

For instance, for each fifteen chil-
dren in the Day Care program, there
must be a teacher who holds a col-
lege degree, an aide, a cook and aide,
a janitor, and a bus driver. Under
the OEO rules, the local governing
agency of the program must con-
tribute 10% toward Day Care.

In-Kind Contributions

This 10% is given primarily by the
vestry of the R. E. Lee Church, who
have waived rent on their educational
building. Lexington attorney William
O. Roberts and Dr. Robert Munger
contribute their services,

Famed ‘Mink’ Magazine Replaced

W&L ‘Collegian’

By REEVE KELSEY

One of the long lost publications
of the W&L publishing tradition is
the “Mink Magazine” which first
emerged on the Colonnade in the fall
of 1920 and flourished until 1929, a
year that was the end of many
glorious things. “Mink” was an unbe-
lievable collection of jokes and puns
of printable and, more often than
not, unprintable nature, along with

occasional story or essay.

There was an exchange column of
sorts, entitled the “Wash-Lee Wash,”
which ran all of the most miserable
jokes that could be culled from so-
called comic magazines across the
nation, This poet’s reply to his edi-

Snow Thwarts Tankmen

Che great snow of January 13 which
cancelled the basketball game against
East Carolina also thwarted Coach
Stearns’ tankmen in their trip to
Durham, North Carolian and a meet
aginst Duke.

The Generals got as far as Natural
Bridge in their trip before acknowl-
edging the power of the elements.
Instead the tankmen had performance
tests that afternoon, and according to
Coach Stearns their performances are
continuing to improve.

After the exams the swimmers face
a heavy schedule until the end of the
season. On February 9 they travel
to Old Dominion for a meet which

will be followed by home meets
against Loyola and West Virginia Uni-
versity on the 16th and 20th of
February respectively. They then

travel to St. Louis with the wrestling
team to compete in the CAC finals.
The Generals so far this year have
a 2-2 record. Their two losses have
been to powerful teams: American
University and Catholic University

 

both in Washington. The over-all
standouts have been veteran junior
Billy Ball and the freshman marvel,
Bill Brumback. In the Catholic meet
Brumback was able to beat Catholic
veteran Jim Reynolds in the 60 yard
and 100 yard freestyle events; against
American, Brumback captured a first
in the 100 yard freestyle and a second
in the long 1000 yard freestyle.

Ball, with a more balanced ability
captured a second in the 200  indi-
vidual medley and a first in the 200
yard backstroke against American.
In the Catholic meet Ball captured a
first in the 200 IM. and a second in
the backstroke event,

Co-captain Pat Costello and Noel
Clinard can be counted on to boost
the score. Costello relegated to third
place in the American meet, returned
with vengance to win in the Catholic
meet. Mike Berry, Costello’s under-
study, has won against Gettysburg
and Randolph-Macon, while Coach
Stearns did not swim Costello so as

Repeat Win Ove

By MARK BROMLEY

Last Friday night, Washington and
Lee's wrestling team was overpow-
ered by William and Mary. The loss,
by the score of 29-5, brought the
General's record to two wins while
suffering three defeats.

The team salvaged only a tie and
a win to account for its five points.

of repeating last year’s victory over

Tuesday, p.m.

By RIC BERARD

In an effort to clarify the re-
scheduling of the East Carolina game
which was snowed out last Saturday
night, I talked with Rob Bauer yester-
day an dhe said: “We had East Caro-
lina scheduled for this Wednesday at
Greenville but there is a University
regulation that says that there can
be no away athletic contests for five
days prior to an exam period. Since
Wednesday would have been the fifth
day and he said: “We had East Caro-
while we are discussing February 21
as a possible make-up date, it ap-
pears as though the game will be
scratched,”

a a *

Also last night,
Fauber as he limped away from
infirmary having been cured of
flu. Not looking especially well, Stu
confirmed the fact that despite the
excellent medical care and personal
attention of good ole Nurse Hotinger,
he would not be able to play until
Friday against Mars Hill. It’s too bad
because Stu is a fine athlete with a
lot of desire and his talents have
been missed. We all hope he is in
good shape by Friday, (Hear that,
Nurse Hotinger?!)

Actually, Fauber isn’t the _ first
member of his family to come to WK&L
and play basketball. His brother,
Roger, was here in the early sixties
as one of W&L’s starting “forwards,”
a term replaced by Coach Canfield
with them ore current jargon of
“wing.”

With respect to the remainder of
the schedule, Stu said that the tough-
est part of our schedule would be
in February when we tackle both
Roanoke and Old Dominion College
(which beat East Carolina by one
point in Greenville.) And while our
game with O.D.C. will be particularly
rough since it is their “homecoming
game”—they don't have a football
program and basketball is their major
sport with all the trappings and school
pride that we have traditionally as-
sociated with football, our team this

year is even more unified than last
year. Declaring that “we found our-
selves against Lycoming (W&L’s only
loss thus far),” Stu gave advance
warning to what type of ball the
team intends to play towards win-
ning the state smal college basketball
title.

Let’s hope we keep the ball bounc-
ing our way in the two home games
this week. The first game is against
Greensboro College at 8:00 p.m. to-
night. The second, which should be
a close game, is with a good Mar

Hill College five-some on Friday
night, also at 8:00 p.m.
For those of you who are des-

perate for a real school cheer to let
forth with at tonight’s game, I sug-
gest the following from which the
name of this sacred publication was
derived in 1897:

Canfield To Re-schedule

East Carolina Game

Saturday morning found the Gen-
erals unable to leave for their game
with East Carolina. At the present
time, due to exams, a date has not
been found for rescheduling the game.
East Carolina was one of the high-
lights of this year’s schedule and
Coach Canfield is trying to find
another date that is mutually con-
vienent to both teams.

fonight the Generals take on
Greensboro College and Friday night
they meet Mars Hill. Both games
are at home. After exams the Gen-
erals will take on Roanoke College
and Old Dominion in what promises
to be two of the harder games of
the season.

provides summer employment, at the

In return, the Council asks for a
moral commitment to remain in

none has dropped out.

In addition, there is an in-school

whose participants (all classified as
being from poor families) are given
jobs for 12 hours a week. The Labor
Department pays for these two pro-
grams.

The Department of the Interior

more pleased if, as Brown predicts,

But for Brown, the father of a

Clinard has captured two firsts in
three outings as W&L's leading diver.
His only defeat came at the hands
on Catholic University which defi-
nitely had a home pool advantage.

The opening relay team of Billy
Ball (backstroke), Pat Costello (breast-
stroke), Dave Kympton (dolphin-but-
terfly), and Ross Forman (freestyle)
provide a formidable challenge for
any opposing team, and have in-

Chuck Garten and Scott McElroy in

Garten has become an expert at the

composition,

Nixon's reception was

(Continued from page 2)
“Mink-Convulsions,” “Mink-Hang-
overs,” and “Mink-Sickness.”

There was also fare of poetical and
prose works. The poetry dealt with
the high platonic and spiritual love.
A typical poem is given in its un-
abridged and unexpurgated form:

“Love is like an onion
We taste it with delight
But when it is gone,
we wonder

Whatever made us bite.”

In attempting to find the person
responsible for this oasis of sickness,
we found a staff box called the “Mink
Family” with its listing of “The
Mink” (editor), “Funny-Mink” (joke
editor), the “Kitty-Minks” (the copy
editors), and the “Business-Minklets”
(the business staff).

What was even more surprising to
discover was that the first editor of
“Mink” was Fitzgerald Flournoy, a
long-loved and venerated professor of
English at Washington and Lee. Dr.
Flournoy also wrote a little poetry,
none of which was reminiscent of his
more unrestrained days as editor of
“Mink.” A current member of the
faculty has characteried Dr. Flour-
noy as a true Elizabethan—one might
assume that is where he acquired his
pleasure for puns.

The first editorial explained the
derivation of “Mink’s” name: “ ‘Mink’
is a title that has long been applied
to the men of Washington and Lee.
If, as rumor has it, the name was
originated by our friends at the Insti-
tution across the way, we can readily
understand why it should be so, for
it is well and widely known that the
mink always gets ahead of the rats. .”
The magazine was full of special
features, like its “Frat A B C’s”: “Pi
Delta Theta: Good at drinking tea!
Rather high hat — smart-looking
women always accompany them.”
“Swigma Chi: Smart looking boys—
Never bring their own women but do
a lot of cutting.” “Kappa Falfa: The
life of the party, their absence is
ruinous to the welfare of young
women who want something different
in the way of—entertainment.” And
“Theta Bilto Pi: More conservative—
rather conceited about themselves, but
nice boys on the whole.”

-sotagagaeetse Sees

 

 

 

 

There was also a great fad of “U
tell °em jokes” which were the most
horrid example of the American cul-
ture of the ’20’s: “U tell ‘em wheel,
I just spoke;” “U tell ‘em water,
you've been drunk;” and “U tell ’em
Sigma, these jokes are Nu.”

In order to frustrate exam study-
ing, the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi will
conduct a contest with prizes by
the bushel (first place: a free cup
of coffee) for the person who sub-
mits the best “U tell ’em joke”
on the contemporary “W&L” scene.
All entries must be submitted to
any member of the Tuesday staff
before Fancy Dress. The decison
of the judges will be FINAL!

 

‘Mink’ Magazine of the Twenties

The Southern Collegian had sus-
pended publication during World War
1 and had not resumed publication at
the time of “Mink’s” birth. The Col-
legian appeared again in 1927 of a
much nobler stuff than today. The
competition with the Collegian and
the weight of the Great Depression
must have conspired to kill “Mink.”
But then, did any magazine which
printed the following poem deserve to
live?:

“Three Blind Dates

They want to make you run

Three Blind Dates sad everyone—

All three a perfect fright

Never saw such in your life

As these three blind Dates.”

Atwood Leads
Assembly Today

E. C. Atwood, Jr., Dean of Stu-
dents, opened his Founder's Day
Speech this morning with allusions
to an earlier speech by Richard M.
Nixon, and requested that “standing
ovations be held to a minimum.”
“Rebels, Past and
Present,” Dean Atwood noted that
the University’s founders, George
Washington and Robert E. Lee, were
both rebels devoted to local autonomy
and the principle that the governed
should participate in their govern-
ment.

In speaking of

By drawing parallels to the motives
that animate students of today, At-
wood noted that the civil rights and
peace movements seem to be waning
and that students are more interested
in campus problems.

These problems they are trying to
solve by he same tactics used with

national issues. Atwood said that
this interest is greatly preferred to
the indifference of the 1950's, and

that, especially in allowing participa-
tion in student affairs, there has been
great progress.

But in the area of student participa

Letters To The Editor .. .

Dear Editor:

Let me first say that the Editor
of the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi should
direct his attention in the future to

such relatively unimportant tissues 4
repainting the columns of Newcomb
Hall or putting more vending ma-
chines in the Freshman Dorm where
the lack of a mind is no great handi
cap. His pointless editorial of last
fuesday is certainly a strong indica
tion that he does not have the ability
to deal properly with an important
issue
It is a sad situation when an Edi
blindly equates a protest against

Leach, Jr., presently at the American
University at Beirut, Lebanon, and
on leave of absence from the Depart-
ment of Library Science of the Uni-
versity of Kentucky, Lexington, Ken-
tucky.

Having served as librarian at Wash-
ington College, Chestertown, Mary-
land, after World War Il, Mr. Cole-
man was appointed head librarian
under the administration of Francis
Pendleton Gaines. He has since con-
tinued in that capacity through two
other presidents and has initiated
numerous changes in the procedures,
assets, and physical plant at Mc-
Cormick Library.

R-t P: Mr. Coleman, have you en-
joyed working as librarian at Wash-
ington and Lee for the past twenty
years?

Coleman: It has been a very plea-
surable experience, but indeed hectic.
rhis library can be quite the rat-race
when it wishes.

R-t P: Have you gained much satis-
faction in the work here?

Coleman: Frustration, I

think,

 

would be better phraseology; | feel
that | could have done much more
than | have, as my attempts to alter
some policies have been thwarted.

R-t P: What was the condition of
McCormick Library, when you first
became head librarian?

Coleman: The library was in very
poor physical and financial condition
when I first took it over.

The library hours have been ex-
tended over 30 hours a week, and my
staff has been enlarged by several
members, three typewriters, an extra
microfilm reader, and a Xerox copy-
ing machine have all been added
since then to help the students in
their studies,

R-+t P: Have you composed any
lang-range plans, which the new li-
brarian will have to complete?

Coleman: Yes, | have several which

1 feel are necessary for a_ better
library. They include the completion
of the sixth stack, a new music

room, an improved ventilation system,
larger toilet facilities, additional study

nars, while not finalized, is “tenta-
tively official,” according to Staff
Keegin, chairman.

Generally, participation in the
seminars is on a “first come” basis,
and interested students must register.

Keegin asked that all students
wanting to participate in the Thrus-
ton Morton seminar at 3:00 p.m.,
Feb. 7, contact Larry Mann, Davis
Dormitory, 463-7504.

Cartwright was fouled a total of six

affairs, party unity, extremism, ete.

A floor fight on some of the planks,
such as usually occurs at the real
national conventions, is not unex-
pected during the Washington and Lee
event.

Bellmon served as Oklahoma's gov-
ernor from 1963-67, then returned to
his 2,100-acre wheat and cattle farm
near Billings, since Oklohoma’s Con-
stitution limited him to one four-year
term. He is a candidate for the U. S.
Senate this year.

Long active in Oklahoma Republi-
can politics, Bellmon served one term
in the state’s House of Representatives
in 1946-48 and directed the Nixon-
for-President campaign there in 1960.

Macon And W&L
Sponsor Seminar
On ‘War and Peace’

Students from Randolph-Macon
Women’s College and W&L will meet
on intelectual grounds next semester,
when a new extra-curricular seminar
group gets under way in February
aS an experiment in co-education.

“An Anatomy of War and Peace
an objective investigation of the phe-
nomena of peace and war as they
influence the arts, science, politics,
religion, and other aspects of human
thought and action—has been chosen
as the general topic for the seminar.

The group, containing about 10 stu-
dents from each school, is expected
to meet twice a month for four
months, with the place of meeting
alternating between to two campuses.

At each meeting, a professor from
the host school will present a talk
illustrating some of the influences of
war and peace. Afterwards, the sub
ject will be thrown open for dis
cussion by the participants in the
seminar.

 

The idea originated at Randolph-
Macon, where a number of students
expressed the feeling that an occas
ional male opinion might be valu-
able for students at an all-women’s
school—and vice-versa. The project
and topic were drawn up by the
student curriculum committee there

The program being sponsored

on the W&L side by Phi Eta Sigma,
freshman scholastic honorary society,
in cooperation with the IFC

Mike Dunn, president of the Phi
Eta Sigma, has announced there are
still openings for interested students
from WAL, particularly those whose
interests lie largely in science, philso-
phy and religion, and other non
political fields. Persons who wish to
join should contact Dunn at 453- 4726.

able only of “participation” and not
“complete autonomy.”

The final segment of the student
revolt Atwood called “destructive.”
Some radicals, he said, would prefer
“academies for revolutionaries,” with-
out grades, classes, or education, but
this movement is “going to pot.” He
encouraged students to make them-
selves felt through peaceful, orderly
means,

Atwood turned his attention to the
seeming lack of student activists at
W&L. The reason, he felt, is that
while students across the country are
demanding to be heard, “at W&L they
are listened to.” Even in the area
of academic affairs, student opinions
are always considered, if not always
heeded. He cited the Student Cir-
riculum Committee as an example.

Finally, Atwood observed that the
activists are in an exciting position,
but the question is whether they will
have the “stamina” to bring change
if they get the power they desire.

Generals Annex Eleventh

(Continued from page 1)

Tonight the Generals face a very
tough team from Mars Hill College.
Though relatively unknown, Mars
Hill boasts a fine squad that has
beaten Lenoir Rhyne, a team which
beat W&L in a pre-season scrim-
mage by more than thirty points.
Like many of the teams on the W&L
schedule, Mars Hill is a run-and-
shoot club. The difference is that they
may be a little bit better than the
others,

The Generals
have won. their

are

-}| games, However, they must face one

of their stiffer tests of the season
with Earl Edwards, Stu Fauber and
Norwood Morrison all out with the
flu. Whether they will play remains
in doubt, and there is no question
that a lack of depth could hurt the
Generals. Mars Hill should provide
a difficult test.

‘Luke’ Stirs
Egg Craze

In the °20’s and °30’s it was eat-
ing goldfish. In the °40’s and °50’s it
was stuffing people into telephone
booths. And now, inspired by that
feat of feats performed by Paul
“Cool Hand Luke” Newman, the
present rage (at least in rageful Lex-
ington) is eating hard boiled eggs.

Organized by Mike “The Greek”
Miles, local bookmaker and reputed
Cosa Nostra head, a contest will be
held the first week after exams, pitting
Gordon “Gut” Findlay, Kappa Sig
sophomore from Kerrville, Texas
against an unknown ZBT representa-
tive, Art “The Hebe” Loring.

Mike The Greek has informed us
that rules established in the movie
“Cool Hand Luke” will apply in this
contest, i.e., eggs must be hard-boiled,
may be peeled and fed to contestants,
and must be wholly swallowed within
the given time period to count as a
fully eaten egg, the time period being
one hour. A contestant who blows
lunch (or breakfast, as the case may
be) will be disqualified.

Although it is doubted that either
contestant will match Luke’s gastro-
nomical performance of fifty eggs,
Miles has indicated that Findlay
should be able to engorge at least
thirty-five.

The contest will be held in the
Kappa Sig house. Admission will be
one dollar, and this price will include
one beer. More beer will be avail-
able. Betting will be set up on the
paramutual system, as determined by
members of the W&L math depart-
ment. The admission fee will help
cover the costs of Alka-Seltzer, Pepto-
Bismal, rug-cleaning and disinfecting,
and a stipend to the contestants,

Letter to the Editor

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

Il, too, being aware of the weighty
moral responsibility of a W&L gentle-
man, must state my serious concern
with the traditional standard of con-
ventional dress.

To encourage compliance to this
most critical standard, and defend
our hallowed and revered heritage
from the crass, boorish like of Mr.
Dunbar (as small a minority as this
element of unrefined vulgarity may
be on this beautiful campus notwith-
standing), | must humbly and urgently
suggest that Gold Stars be awarded
to those students who consistently ful-
fill the sacred obligation to beclothe
themselves decorously, and that these
students, at the occasion of their
graduation, wear a set of Mickey
Mouse ears with five blue and white
stars and a tassel, in lieu of the
mortarboard.

Gentlemen, creeping barbarism is
upon our very doorstep, threatening

to bury us beneath the bulk of the|]-

ill-bred, unpolished masses!

It may already be too late, but
the effort must be made, for the
sake of those gentlemen who went
before us and are now vigilantly
watching from the great campus in
the sky, to repel the advances of
the slovenly herd.

If this struggle is successful here,

463-6202

it may bring about a sartorial re-
awakening among American students,
catapaulting W&L into its celestial
spot in the top ranks of first grade
education as the savior of Ameri-
ca’s corrupted six-year-olds.
Most urgently,
Douglas R. Engle, 69

PRANSITION:

Contact Symposium Starts Feb. 7;
Senator Morton Is Featured Speaker

Contact 1968 — entitled “What's
New, Pachydrem?” — begins tomor-
row afternoon to examine the present
status of the Republican Party and
to analyze its prospects for the future.

The symposium will consist of a
series of seminars, speeches and panel
discussions. The panel discussions,
which will follow directly every
speech, will include questions from
the audience.

The kickoff for the fourth Contact
will be at 4 p.m. Wednesday, when
a seminar with Senator Thurston
Morton, Republican from Kentucky,
will take place.

At 8 p.m. that evening, Sen. Morton
will give a speech in Lee Chapel on
the rights and duties of the opposi-
tion party in Congress, One question
expected during the evening session
will be the extent to which a national
party's stance on various public ques-
tions is hammered out in Congress.

Senator Morton's recently announc-
ed “dovish” position on Viet Nam and
whether this announcement has pro-
moted an intraparty rift is certain
to discussed. Sen. Morton was once
the Republican National Chairman
and the chairman of the Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee, as
well as permanent chairman of the
1964 Republican National Conven-
tion. He is in a position to discuss
the consequences of a ranking mem-
ber of a party taking a well-publicized
divergence from the party line on a
major issue,

Thursday will bring to the Wash-
ington and Lee campus one of the
Republican Party's most colorful
urban leaders, Gov. Theodore Mc-
Keldin, and a scholar-party worker
who is one of the most knowledgeable
persons in the United States today
on the Republican Party, Stephen
Hess. Starting the day's program will

be a seminar at 2 p.m. with former
governor and former mayor Me-
Keldin of Baltimore, Md. A true Re-
publican since his birth (the R. is for
Roosevelt), McKeldin is known for
his witty approach to politics and his
biting criticism of all that displeases
him.

He was the first Republican to cap-
ture the statehouse of Maryland from
the Democrats in many, many years,
and he had the honor to place Presi-
dent Eisenhower in nomination in
1952 and to second the nomination
of Nelson Rockefeller in 1964. Mc-
Keldin, however, did not feel that
party unity or his dedication to Re-
publicanism were sufficient reasons to

support Senator Goldwater in the
1964 election.
Gov. McKeldin will also address

himself to the Republican dilemma
in the cities at 8:00 that evening.

At 4 p.m. an address by Mr. Stephen
Hess, a fellow at the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard
University, will be given. Mr. Hess
was the co-author of “The Republican
Establishment: The Present and
Future of the G.O.P.”
in preparing this encyclopedic pub-

 

i
His research |

|

lication has given him deep insight
into the inner workings of the Re-
publican Party.

Mr. Hess’s speech will center on
the G.O.P. and up-date the conclu-
sions drawn by him in “The Republi-
can Establishment.” In doing so, he
will probably spend some time on the
Rockefeller phenomenon and also at-
tempt to answer some of the criticism
leveled at the book by such persons
as Robert D. Novak. Mr. Hess’s other
books include “Hats in the Ring” (co-
authored by Malcolm Moos) and
“America’s Political Dynasties.”

Barry M. Goldwater, the titular
head of the Republican Party, will be
Contact’s guest Friday. Mr. Gold-
water will talk about the role of the
conservative in the Republican Party
in his speech in Evans Dining Hall
at 8 p.m.

A seminar with Goldwater will take
place Friday in duPont Auditorium
at 3 p.m. Unlike the other seminars,
participation in the Goldwater semi-
nar will be by invitation only. How-
ever, the seminar will be open to the
public and all those who wish to
listen will be welcome.

Saturday promises to be one of
the more interesting days of the

symposium. With Professor Samuel
Lubell of Columbia University’s
Graduate School of Journalism and
nationally syndicated political colum-
nist Robert D. Novak as its guests,
Contact will enjoy a direct dialogue
between its speakers.

Professor Lubell, who will speak at
4 p.m., will discuss the failure of both
political parties to meet the challenge
of the domestic revolution in America
today. An authority on polling and
the author of many books, “The Fu-
ture of American Politics,” “White
& Black: The Test of a Nation,”
“Revolt of the Moderates” and “When
People Speak” (a monologue) to
name a few, Lubell promises to be
one of the more controversial speak-
ers of the Contact week. Mr. Novak
is tentatively scheduled to be on the
Lubell panel following the speech.

At 2 p.m. on Saturday, Mr. Novak
will participate in a seminar and at
8 p.m. he will discuss the Republican
Party.

Novak, too, has made a contribu
tion to contemporary political lit
erature. He wrote “The Agony of the
G.O.P.” and he was the co-author of

“Lyndon B. Johnson: The Exercise
of Power.”
Professor Lubell will be on the

Novak panel, and will assure a con-
tinuation of the give-and-take of

Che Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspapet
Tuesday, February 6, 1968

—_——_

The time has come,
the walrus said

 

... to talk of many things. Such as, the basketball team. A
decade and a half ago, when subsidized athletics so spectacularly
took leave of Washington and Lee, so did (as the Friday
Edition mentioned earlier this year, in another context) a good
deal of our alumni spirit. And that meant much, much more
than just fewer visitors to the west end of campus: because
when you come right down to it, for good or not, big-time
athletics are undoubtedly the single-most important vehicle for
focussing widespread attention on a college or university. Only
a very few schools have popularly known names which are not
owed in substantial part to athletic prowess. Even one or two
Ivy-League universities—not too many people can tell you
much about them except that (1) they exist, (2) they are “in”
the Ivy League and therefore are entitled to a certain quantity
of ascribed “prestige,” and (3) they have “really good’”’
basketball and football teams. It is difficult to say what else—
that is, what academically—makes them specifically good edu-
cational institutions. Without quality (3), qualities (1) and
(2) might do little for a school.

W&L’s basketball team is ‘
a magnificent job in making people all over sit up and take
notice of Washington and Lee. The University cannot help
but benefit when people ask, “All right, “Washington and
Lee’: What is it?”’, because the answers are all good and all
impressive.

That, in itself, is a significant accomplishment. The less
haughty accomplishment of the team is more familiar to every-
body within the University community—resurrecting the pre-
sumed-dead enthusiasm here for something aside from Hollins,
Macon, Sweet Briar, Big Weekends and maintaining the ABC
store. On this matter we can say little that everybody hasn't
already said with pleasure, so we won't. But we agree with every
word of it.

A couple of matters are brought to mind, though, to the
discussion of which we must succumb, For example, the buzzer
for times-out to which attendees at home games are subjected.
It makes stouthearted men crumble, and we suspect it even
shakes the backboards as it shakes the rafters. And the peren-
nial problem of fire hazard in Doremus—for some reason (we
hope there’s a reason) known only to God and somebody
over in the gym, people are locked in the world’s largest poten-
tial casket. If the gym ever catches fire, they might as well just
push it and all the bodies inside it over into the ravine and
cover it up, because nobody would escape.

We want to talk, sometime soon, about the quality of the |

refereeing and the lack of it on some occasions, and the need
(now even more obvious) for a new gym as well as for a new
theatre. For the time being, though, the Tuesday Edition
offers its further encouragement and enthusiastic thanks to

Washington and Lee’s Generals—who, in spite of countless |

problems and inhibitions imposed upon them from the ex-

ternal, have developed under Coach Canfield’s fantastic sup- |

ervision into a really great, not-so-small team, that can drag
even the likes of us to watch them do some very good things
on behalf of Washington and Lee.

Stephen Hess

The latest book by Stephen Hess
has received a great deal of praise
from all shades of political opinion,
Hess, who will speak in Lee Chapel
at 4 p.m. Thursday, co-authored with
David Broder “The Republican Estab-
lishment: The Present and Future of
the G.O.P.” Reviewers from National
Review to the New York Times have
called the book the most up-to-date
definitive study of the Republican
Party.

National Review indicated it was
pleased to be considered a major
part of the conservative wing of the

party by the book and concluded
that “For every politic, amateur or
pro, this book can be an excellent

primer for election year 1968,”

In a recent New York Times Book
Review Section, Patrick Anderson
cited the thoroughness with which
Hess and Broder examined the Re-
publican Party. “Now and _ then,
in their SO0-state survey
of the party's standing, the authors
more than he
may want to know about the Re-
publican grass roots, but that is a
risk they had to run in order to satisfy
the professional politicians who will

Novak Critical

There has also been criticism
the book, notably from columnist
Robert Novak who will speak for
Contact on Friday. Hess in his speech
Thursday is expected to “update and
extend” the ideas presented in the
book and Novak is certain to com-
ment on this.

Divided into three parts, “The Re-
s Establishment” examines

first the party on the national level,
its political spectrum, its national fi-
nancial supporters, and its profes-
sional leadership.

Then follows a description of four
of the leading contenders for the

Theodore McKeldin

 

What do you think the Republican
Party can do for the city on a
nation-wide scale? Where would you
start first? How?

These questions and many others
will be attempted to be answered on
Thursday night at 8:00 in Lee Chapel
by former mayor of Baltimore and
former governor of Maryland, Theo-
dore R. McKeldin. He was elected
mayor of the City of Baltimore in
May, 1963, for a term ending in
December, 1967. He had previously
served for two terms as governor of
Maryland from 1951 to 1959, Prior
to that he had served as mayor of
Baltimore from 1943 to 1947,

During his recent term as mayor
of Baltimore, Mr. McKeldin has in-
augurated or brought to fruition a
large number of new programs to
improve physical and social conditions
in the city.

Civil Rights Advocate

Many new programs were begun to
improve living and working conditions
for the people of Baltimore. Mayor
McKeldin sponsored before the city
council a comprehensive civil rights
bill prohibiting discrimination in em-
ployment, public accommodations,
housing, education, and health and
welfare services.

This omnibus bill was enacted ex-
for the housing section. The

term and has begun many programs
to alleviate the causes of poverty in
Baltimore. In an effort to improve
housing conditions, the Mayor has
expanded the City’s conservation pro-
gram while at the same time engaging

_Pennsylvania to make a comprehen-

sive study of the City’s needs with
regard to conservation of housing.

Contact Promises A Lively Discussion
Thursday

Saturday

Samuel Lubell

Samuel Lubell, noted newspaper-
man and foreign correspondent, has
this to say about Barry Goldwater in
his book, “The Future of American
Politics”:

“Goldwater was campaigning for
‘a choice, not an echo,’ assaulting the
whole New Deal at every front. Usu-
ally there was something he was
against that most people wanted to
save.”

“In Butler County, lowa, to cite
just one example, a farmer climbed
down off his tractor, thought for a
few moments and said, ‘I'm a Re-
publican but I'll probably go the other
way. I'm afraid Goldwater will do
what he says and get rid of the whole
farm program,’

 

“ee

Mind you, I
this farmer continued. ‘We'd all
better off now if the government had
gotten out of farming at the end of
World War HI. But I have three kids

think he’s right.)
be |

to put through college. Maybe I'm
letting Goldwater down, but it would |

hurt to much to do what he pro-
posed.” ”
It is what Lubell termed “this

sense of ‘the all or nothing.” which
cost Goldwater the election. He traces
the political scene back to its be-
ginnings with this explanation.
Election of 1928

“In many ways, Smith's defeat in
1928. rather than Roosevelt's 1932
victory, marked off the arena in
which today’s politics are being
fought. The Happy Warrior and four-
time governor of New York first
hacked out the rural-city cleavage
which generates so much of the force
behind the present struggle between
Congress and the President. It was
Smith who first slashed through the
traditional alignments that had held
so firmly since the Civil War, clear-
ing the way for the more compre-
hensive realignment which came later.

A “fundamental difference between
the Republican and Democratic par-
ties is that they have been the ve-
hicles for the political advancement
of quite different ethnic elements. The

 

Republicans, by political necessity,
became sensitive to the aspirations of
the “old” immigrant elements, who
settled so largely on the farms. The
Democrats, in turn, have been
alive io the aspirations of the “new
immigrant elements who crowded the
teeming cities.”

Industrial Revolt

“In the industrial centers
volt of the city shifted the

the
balance of

re

political power from employers to
labor, from the descendants of the
“old” Americans to the offspring of

the former minority groups. To sur
vive politically, the Eastern Republi

Robert Novak

Robert D. Novak, Saturday eve-
ning speaker, presents a rare blend
of insight and knowledgeability, From
the American heartland—lllinois—he
attended the University of Illinois be-
fore taking a job as reporter for the
Joliet Herald News upon his gradua-
tion.

Novak thus presents a striking con-
trast to Contact's other two political
analysts. Stephen Hess is an east
coast native, while Samuel Lubell was
born in Poland before immigrating to
New York as a boy.

Novak, then, comes from the Re-
publican stronghold of the Middle
West, a major part of the party base.
Many believe this grass roots support
is drying up and Novak will consider
the problem of its shrinkage and pros-
pects for its expansion.

Capitol Hill Correspondent

Novak served in Korea as an army
lieutenant and returned to join the
Associated Press staff in Omaha. He
made rapid prgression up the AP
ladder. From Omaha he went to Lin-
coln, Nebraska, then to Indianapolis,
and finally to Washington, D.C, in
1957 as Capitol Hill correspondent.

In 1958 Mr. Novak joined the Wall
Street Journal staff and in three years
became chief congressional reporter
for the Journal.

Novak and Rowland Evans joined
forces on “Inside Report,” a political
column published five time weekly and
syndicated in 160 newspapers by the
Chicago Sun Times.

Time calls the column, which is car-
ried by the Washington Post a “strik-
ing success.” the fact of which “can
be traced to its emphasis on reporting
rather than punditry.

Novak, in his capacity as columnist,
has traveled to Europe, Asia, and

Latin America to test grass roots senti-

 

ment, foreign policy and political
movemenis. Most recently he has visit-
ed Guatemala and the Eastern Com-
munist countries
Criticized Hess

Recently, Novak criticized “The Re-
publican Establishment.” a book by
another Contact speaker, Stephen
Hess. in talk here Feb. 8
#00 in Lee Chapel, will answer
this criticism. We may have the be
ginnings of a dialogue between these
two men in the making

Novak is the author of

Hess his

“The Agony

of the G.O.P.. 1964° and co-author
i of “Lyndon B. Johnson: The Exercise
of Power.” He has also appeared in
the Saturday Evening Post, Esquire,

the New Republic, the Reporter, and
National Observer. He will speak at

Jody Kline

 

Comeback Story Of The Year

When Mr. Canfield took over the
job of Head Basketball Coach in 1964
there wasn’t a great deal of talent to
work with. Recuriting was unknown
and a coach had to field the best
team he could from whatever showed
up on the first day of practice. Coach
Canfield had some luck though; he
found a pair of freshmen who led
him to believe that things weren't
quite as bad as he had anticipated.
Those freshmen were Larry Perreault
and Jody Kline.

Both Larry and Jody saw consid-
erable action on that year’s varsity
but unfortunately the team posted a
dismal 2-17 record. Then second
semester Perreault encountered aca-
demic difficulties and was forced to
seek another school where his basket-
ball talents could exhibit themselves.
The following year Jody found him-
self with a starting assignment at
guard, That was the same year that
things took a turn for the better.
The team went on to post a 10-15
record as Jody, along with freshmen
John Carrere, Rob Bauer, and Earl
Edwards, brought a spark of life into
the previous dull occurence of W&L

| basketball games. The student body

sensed that something was in the mak-

| ing and it was. The prospects for the

|
|
|

 

following year were indeed favorable.

When school resumed in the fall
of 1966 a great many changes had
occurred in the shape of the W&L

team. Coach Canfield had recruited
some of the finiest freshmen in
the area (make that about a 200
mile radius), The Generals had height
to spare with 6’5” Mal Wesselink,
65” Mel Cartwright and returning
letterman 6’5” Earl Edwards. Unfor-
tunately there was a gloomy side to

 

the picture—All-Staters Rob Bauer
and Frank Morrison encountered in-
juries that allowed them to see only
limited action and Jody Kline came
onto the court about 15 pounds over-
weight.

Because of his extra weight Jody
lost a good deal of his speed and also
lost his job to Tommy Cox who came
on to be one of the finest defensive
| players W & L has even seen. Jody
/saw only occasional action as the
Generals rolled up a 20-5 record and

 

 

 

 

Player of

Mal Wesselink is one of
the more consistent players
on the basketball team.
Every game he turns in a
fine performance and _ his
play is one of the big fac-
tors in the Generals’ success
this season. Mal may always
be counted on for double
figure scoring and his de-
fense is always up to par.
Mal is currently averaging
12.6 points per game and
6.7 rebounds. Also, he is
shooting close to 50%, from
the floor and averaging 1.5
assists per game.

Mel’s play in the week
before exams was outstand-

breezed to the CAC championship.

After that season, Jody had every
reason to quit the team. It looked as
though he would be replaced perma-
nently and few people remembered
the fine performances of his fresh-
man and sophomore years, But Jody
didn’t quit; he was elected co-captain
and proceded to lose that extra weight.

When practice began this fall there
was a great deal of talk as to who
would start as guard along with John
Carrere. When the Generals came on
the floor against Bridgewater on
December 1, it was Jody Kline and
it’s been Jody ever since. After one
off-year Jody has come back to play
good, steady, heads-up basketball. On
defense he’s aggressive and keeps up
the pressure. On _ offense Jody
handles the ball well, keeps a cool
head and throws the type of pass that
has made him the team leader in
assists. Though he seldom takes a
shot, when he does it is almost a
certain two points. Jody also comes
down with more than his share of re-
bounds.

When most players would have quit,
Jody stuck it out and it has payed off
for both him and basketball at Wash-
ington and Lee. Jody has shown the
drive and determination that is char-
acteristic of the real athlete and has
shown the spirit, leadership, and un-
selfishness that it characteristic of the
true team player. Surely the come-
back player of the year is Jody Kline.

According to Gov, McKeldin, the
growing strength of the Republicans

factors: 1) the broad background of
diverse interests and talents offered
by their candidates; and 2) that today
most people will vote for candidates
regardless of race or creed, There-

to run for each office on the same
basis.

Hess stated that “Nixon is a four-

based on his winning the first three
primaries”—those in New Hampshire,
Wisconsin and Nebraska

Rockefeller and Reagon, in that
order, were listed as the next most
promising candidates. Hess also saw
Percy and Romney as possible, but

1968 Republican Political Prospects
Is Subject Of CONTACT Program

Morton
By PAT AREY

The 1968 Republican convention
will be “a much more open conven-
tion,” Sen. Thurston Morton told
WAL students Wednesday.

Sen. Morton, the opening speaker
of the 1968 CONTACT program,
spoke at a seminar in the Law School
during the afternoon and in Lee
Chapel Wednesday evening.

Because of the proliferation of
favorite son candidates, Morton said
that the GOP convention, to be held
in Miami this August, would approach
conventions such as the ones in 1948
and 1952.

But, Morton predicted, if Richard
Nixon wins big in the primaries, and
if “he gets a lot of this loser image
off his back,” he will be front runner
for the nomination at the GOP con
vention,

Morton said that he was tired of
losing elections, and he would look

Friday, February 9, 1968

Symposium Week .

The nine days between Feb. 7 and 15 this year ought to.
have been called Symposium Week. Not only have we been
treated to the annual IFC-sponsored CONTACT Symposium,
but beginning on Tuesday of next week the Glasgow Endow-
ment Committee will present a three-day literary symposium
on “Approaches to Shakespeare.” All of this, naturally enough, |
set us to thinking on the subject of symposiums, or more
particularly, symposiums at W&L.

This year’s CONTACT program was, as always, beautifully
planned and executed; the eminence and variety of the speakers
if anything even surpasses CONTACT’s performances in the |
past. But it is to the Glasgow Committee that W&L owes
special thanks this year for restoring some balance to the
aims and subjects of what has been called “the symposium
experience,”

CONTACT was conceived in 1964 with the avowed pur-|
pose of offering “varying viewpoints and approaches to an
overall intellectual problem.” It has certainly achieved that
aim in the four years since then. CONTACT is undoubtedly |
one of the best intellectual symposiums around—alas. Since |
1965, when it took a socio-economic-political look at “The |
American Experience”; through 1966, when it took a socio- |
economic-political view of “The City”; and into 1967, when
it took a socio-economic-political view of“The Crumbling |
Establishment,’ CONTACT has exhibited a depressing socio- |
economic-political sameness as to topic. Now, in 1968, if it |
is true that we have succeeded in dispensing with the sociology
and sociological economics, we still have the politics with |
“What’s New, Pachyderm?”

Now, we have absolutely no objection to any of these fields’
of knowledge. The topics which have been covered by
CONTACT are such that they cannot help but be of pressing |
interest to any thinking student—for that matter, to any think-
ing American. Certainly the discussion of such subjects is a
valid function of an intellectual symposium. It is not, however,
the only function.

It has been argued that these topics appeal to a larger
percentage of the student body than do other topics, and
(adds the cynic) that attendance is bad even then. This is a
distortion of the intellectual aims which CONTACT professes |
to further. We are not dealing here with a quantitative matter.
CONTACT is not a Broadway play. Success is not measured by
the size of the crowd. This would seem to be an obvious point.
It is so far from being so that during last year’s fraternity-
administration tussle the low attendance of CONTACT could
actually be used as proof that students in general are anti-
intellectual. This is preposterous. There are a very large num- |
ber of persons at this school—serious students, with serious |
intellectual commitments—-who do not go to CONTACT
simply because they do not want to hear another four days of
sociology, sociological economics, and politics. Yet at a school
which calls itself a liberal arts institution, they run the risk of
being called anti-intellectual.

That is why our special admiration and gratitude goes to
the Glasgow Endowment Committee—for having the courage
and good sense to recognize that Shakespeare can be as im-
portant, as exciting, and as crucial to our times as “What's
New, Pachyderm?”; and for undertaking a three-day seminar
with the full realization that it will not attract a crowd as large

as CONTACT’s,

The Glasgow Committee has made the first step in the
right direction. We hope, in fact, that it will be possible for
them to maintain a yearly seminar of this nature in the future,
either in place of or as a supplement to the writer-in-residence
program which the Committee has traditionally sponsored.

Unfortunately, we cannot look to the Glasgow Committee
for much more than such initial encouragement as it is giving
by holding the Shakespeare symposium. By the terms of the
Glasgow Endowment, the Committee is limited to sponsoring
programs which encourage literary ends. It is therefore up to
CONTACT to remedy its own shortcomings and present a
really varied series of topics in the coming years. Why not a
symposium on modern music for 1969? Some of the major
modern composers, folk singers, blue singes, ete., would be no
more difficult to obtain than Mr. Goldwater. Or perhaps a look
at modern art? Or at modern theater (led by Richard Schech-
ner, who attracted so much attention here in October). Or
history. Or philosophy. Or modern poetry, Or mathematics
Or any of the sciences.

None of this should be construed as an attack on the
admirable concept and institution that CONTACT is. But
perhaps a new look is needed at CONTACT’s original purpose:
“to offer varying viewpoints and approaches to an overall
intellectual problem.” That problem is not to be found only
in sociology and politics, but in any field of knowledge where
there are men doing new and important things. That field
and those men belong at CONTACT,

The Pros and Cons of Gold

Melnyk: Pro

By W. WILLIAM MELNYK

Kenneth Paul Shorey, the distin-
guished Canadian liberal with whom
I am sure our leftist colleagues on
campus are aquainted, has commented
that “we are observing the nascence
and growth of what bids fair to
become as astonishingly popular indi-
genous American sport called giggling
at Barry Goldwater,”

To paraphrase California’s Gover-
nor Ronald Reagan, the trouble with
our liberal friends is not that they

much that isn't so. For if the liberal
establishment believes it won a de-
cisive victory in 1964, it is sadly mis-
taken.

They beat Barry Goldwater four
years ago, but the fact so often over-
is that the Goldwater cam-
paign created a grass roots movement

virtually assure a Republican victory
this November. A new Republican
Party emerged from the defeat in
1964. A party with direction, pur-
pose, and support. And it was Barry
Goldwater, with the aid of his vi-
triolic leftist antagonists, who was
primarily responsible for that re-
juvenation.

 

Best Fund Raiser

It is well known that Goldwater |
has been the best fund-raiser the party |
has ever had, and in 1964 his cam- |
paign received hundreds of thousands |
of contributions in five dollar amounts |
and under. For the first time, the
Republican Party was able to obtain
considerable grass roots financial sup-
pour in, five an dten dollars at a!
pour in, five and ten dollar sat a
time, in response to the Goldwater
philosophy and the Goldwater image. |

 

As a will

their

the Republicans

result,
enter the “68 campaign with
biggest war chest in history. And the
money will have come from what has
been traditionally considered Demo-

crat territory: John

American,

Q. Average

But more important than money,
Goldwater has been responsible for
a tremendous increase in manpower.
All those members of Youth for
Goldwater, Citizens for Goldwater-

| Miller, and the dozens of other ad

hoc organizations, did not, dear lib-
erals, disappear into the woodwork
on 4 November 1964. They joined
the ranks of the Republican Party to
continue their crusade, and here is
where grass roots support for the
Gop is most impressive. Gone are
the days of non-ideological Republi-
can “Me Too-ism.” These new sup-
porters are young, enthusiastic, and
above all dedicated to the belief that
Barry Goldwater was right,

| Letters To The Editor .. .

 

To the Editor:

In commenting upon the recent

ard Nixon, it would seem that he
treated the campus to a preview of
the new Nixon campaign style. Re-
laxed and well poised, he delighted
his audience with his references to
“Doc's,” “going down the road,” and
the nationally publicized mock con-
vention. Other comments, however,
in a speech billed as “nonpolitical”
opened the door to controversy. Mr.
Nixon deplored the peace movement
in the United States and attempted to
place the blame for the continuing
war upon the dissenters, If there were
only unity, he exclaims, then, we
could quickly clean this thing up|
and keep the communists in North |
Vietnam. Somehow that sounds like
a familiar refrain that has been
sounded somewhere else before.

In discussing the role of the United
States in the world today, Mr. Nixon
brushed aside the nation’s misgivings |
about the war. In his view, our mis-
sion is to save the world from com-

is that it can not be achieved by
placing the United States in the role
of world policeman endowed with
sweeping powers to maintain order
throughout the universe. Those who
ascribe to this view talk about “the
responsibilities of power,” but in Sen, |
Fulbright’s view, it should more ap-
propriately be called “the arrogance |
of power.” It presents a flatiering self- |

 

portrait, but one totally out of tune |
with the realities of the twentieth
centry. If the United States once
possessed such power, it was the
product of a time we can not now
recall. The determination of people to
chart their own destiny, which is ex-|
pressed in rising nationalism, and the |
emergence of nuclear power in the |
other world, are realities that Ameri-
can foreign policy can no longer |
ignore, even if Mr. Nixon chooses |
to do so |

America says we are defending in

Latin America where the military is

as their military counterparts, to
Greece, the cradle of democracy,
where the colonels rule unchallenged,
the reality of the U.S. dilemma is
made plain.

How can we police the world when

is to keep this nation strong, and not

An excerpt from an article by

staff writer Richard Corrigan on the
editorial page of the Washingion Post
reads: “The students, young men who
were too young for the first grade
when Nixon became Vice-President of
their country, received him with loud
applause, Only one hostile question,
from an anti-war student up in the
balcony, was uttered during his hour
long appearance, and that was met
with hisses and frowns and rollings

“Washington and Lee, in Lexing-

1749) with old school ways, having a
radical contingent that would fil in

A similar reaction occurred when
a student questioned WAL's coat and
tie tradition, The [Tuesday] Ring-tum
Phi asserted that the majority of
students wear coats and ties, and since
the student in question had mairicu
lated at WAL he should have ac
cepted the tradition of coats and ties

Any threat of change to the system
is looked upon with contempt and
derision. The “old school” ways are
perfect. Any student with a dissenting
opinion is radical and furthermore
wrong. Keep up the good work, fellas
After all WAL is “fat city,” is it not?

Dunbar: Con

By ROBERT DUNBAR

Today our little community is be-
ing graced with the presence of one of
this country’s most colorful perform-
ers, the Hon. Barry M. Goldwater.
It has been more than three years
since this man represented the Re-
publican Party in the most recent
presidential election. And during the
past couple of years, Mr. Goldwater's
audience has become quite aware of,
perhaps, an even more colorful con-
servative in the person of William
F. Buckley Jr.

All this is not to imply that Mr.
Goldwater has been inactive since his
defeat in '64, but rather to point out
that his image in the minds of most

For this reason I would like
consider the character of our
tinguished guest.

to
dis-

Ambassador Was a Chimp

First, he is amusing. Yes, Barry
has a wonderful sense of humor
which, no doubt, helped him land
the GOP nomination in °64,

After being nominated by Wash-
ington’s Alfalfa Club in their mock
“national convention,” Mr. Goldwater
delivered an acceptance speech in
which he said the following: “I don’t
want to seem critical. But our first
ambassador in space was a chimp.
And so far he’s the only one in the
State Department who hasn't made a
mistake.”

And at the same time, Mr. Gold-
water is very casual. He is an ex-
cellent speaker who quickly captivates
his audience by such realizations of
his potential as President as this: “I
would not be truthful if I said that
I was fully qualified for the office. I
seldom play golf.”

“Where are you from?”

This leads us to a very important
facet of Barry's character—he is
honest. Mr. Goldwater is really quite
a political satirist, something quite
unusual for a politician. He is a
political realist who “tells it like it
_—

Thus his comment about our go-
ernment: “How is it that our govern-
ment did better against General
Electric than they did against Cuba?”

 

And he gave us an indication of what |
his state-of-the-union mesage might |
be like: “For example, I'm going to}
propose a constitutional amendment:

Army Lieutenaut Gives Views of

water

that any decision of the Supreme
Court must make sense.”

He also said that he would retain
Chester Bowles if he had a State De-
partment and added, “He’s the mystery
guest in the Cabinet; in fact, he’s
going on ‘What’s My Line?’ as soon
as he finds out what his line is.”

But most important, Mr. Goldwater
recognizes himself for what he is:
“Tve never hesitated with an answer,
When anyone asks me how I stand
on integration, I’ve only got one
answer, ‘Where are you from?”

But as aware as Mr. Goldwater is
that his chief end is to get votes,
he is still confused about many larger
issues, For instance, concerning Red
China’s desire to get involved in the
Vietnam war Mr. Goldwater said, “It

 

is on this point that I think Americans
need a real thorough educati§n, on

China... don't think Red China
wants any part of the war. I don't
think Peiping would come into this
war under any circumstances.”

No, Mr. Goldwater, it is you who
need a better education on China!

Almost two years before Mr. Gold-
water came out with this statement,
the Red Chinese had assured for
themselves a more direct link with
the Viet Cong by inviting delegates
from South Vietnam’s National Lib-
eration Front to establish a permanent
headquaters in Peking.

“59 cents a head”

I feel that some mention of Mr.

Goldwater's personal life is necessary.

Good evening, ladies and gentle-
men. This is Henry Portent, your
correspondent in Vietnam, with this
week's seventeenth Special Document-
ary Feature on the progress of the
war.

 

As a change from the usual war
movies, this show will focus on the
daily life of an obscure second lieu-
tenant doing an unnoticed but rather)
trivial job in a second-rate supply

Support Troops. | know you would
see war movies, but hell, a
man could get shot out there.

his Knees. This is because he has been
watking through mud up to his knees,
After all, it has been raining for a/
solid week, which is why the picture |
is so lousy

 

Here he is arriving at his office, |
which as you can see used to be a
packing crate. It used to contain
poncho liners, a very popular item |
with the troops in Vietnam. See that
hole in the bottom left corner, about
three inches across? No, it was not
made by VC bullets, but by some
enterprising serviceman, who then re-
moved through it about three-quaters |
of the contents. No challenge is too)
great for Americans at war! i

There are our hero's clerks, a basic
ally lovable bunch though surly and
demoralized, Notice how well fur
nished the office is, despite its rough
exterior. All the supplies for fifteen
thousand troops come into this depot.
Some even go out again

And here comes the first truck of
the day! Decisively. Li. X opens one
eye and points at a hapless clerk,
who snarls, picks up paper and pencil,
and slinks out into the rain

This monster approaching the cam
era is a Rough Terrain Pork Lift, Li

X is using sign language to tell PFC
Smith, who is more or less driving,
where to put the stuff. PFC Smith
generally drops every third box and
runs over two others trying to pick
it up again. His grace and skill have
been compared to that of a drunken
wate buffalo.

Specialist: Brown

There goes our lieutenant to the
main office for a cup of coffee, water
dripping off the end of his nose. Here
he is complaining to Specialist Brown
about the quality of the coffee. Brown
is making insolent remarks to Li, X
in reply. The men are always making
insolent remarks to Lt. X, who doesn't
seem to know quite what to do about
it.

This is Major Y, over at battalion
headquarters. See how military he
looks? Aren't his boots shiny? Major
Y has what is known as a desk job,
which means that he doesn't walk
around in mud up to his knees much.
Instead he calls our hero up to com-
plain about his clerks’ handwriting.
Major Y likes nice neat handwriting.

Here is Lt. X again. He seems to
be irritated, but possibly he is drop-
kicking that wastebasket around the
office to keep in shape.

Say, Lt. X, isn't it time for lun...

| Where'd he go?

Here he is standing in the chow
line. When he gets to the head there
will be pot roast and dehydrated
potatoes again. This will irritate him

Mail Line

And this is the mail line. He won't
have any mail. This is fully as pre-
dictable as the pot roast and de-
hydrated potatoes, but it will ruin his
day nonetheless

Well, back to work for Lt. X, Notice
that the mud is now halfway up his
thighs.

Our hero is nervous. He is pacing
up and down,

Rugged Maroons Snap General Winning Streak

By JERRY PERLMAN
Friday Sports Editor

Verne Canfield’s General basket-
ballers sacrificed quantity for quality
last night and suffered their second
loss of the season, at the hands of
Roanoke College 70-58, in a defensive
battle played before 2,700 fans at the
Salem-Roanoke Civic Auditorium.

Stifled by the Maroons’ rugged
man-to-man defense, Washington
and Lee took only 53 shots the en-
lire game, as compared to the home
team’s 72, And while the Big Blue
out-percentaged their opponents from

the field 43 to 36 per cent, Roa-
noke’s unbelievable 100 per cent
shooting from the free-throw line

proved to be the margin of victory.

Jody Kline opened the scoring
with a basket at 19:42 in the first
half, and the Generals quickly built

every sports fan in America began |

conjecturing about the expected tour-
nament rematch.

If this reconfrontation comes to pass
as it now seems likely, I, for one,
would have to stick by Elvin Hayes
and his mates. Despite the ready-made
excuse that Coach John Wooden of
the Bruins could have used to ex-
plan Alcindor’s less than spectacular
play, it should be noted that one man
does not a team make.

Big Lew has an outstanding sup-
porting cast in backcourt stars Mike
Warren and Lucius Allen, both of
whom receive competent aid from
cornermen Lynn Shackleford, Edgar
Lacey, and Mike Lynn. However, the
Cougars have some fine stars to fall
back on themselves, and it is the play
of these men that would make a
difference in the next meeting.

The teams have met twice recently,
and in both contests, the Big E held a
Statistical edge over his Bruin count-
erpart. In last year’s NCAA Tourna-
ment, when both were healthy, Elvin
narrowly outscored and outrebounded
Alcindor, This year’s performances
were tainted, of course, by the buga-
boo of Lew’s eyesight.

Washington U,

To Discontinue
B-Ball Support

Several hundred students demon-
| strated last week on the Washington
University campus following a Board
of Trustees decision to withdraw all
financial support from the school’s
intercollegiate basketball program.

The move by the Board was part
of a general tightening of the athletic
purse strings which also saw the re-
duction of the Bears’ 1968 football
schedule from ten to eight games.

In a letter to the St. Louis Post-

Thomas H., Eliot stated that the search
for a new head football coach and
the rising costs of maintaining a
money-making football program were
main reasons behind the decision to
cancel all basketball expenditures. As
Chancellor Eliot explained,

“Dropping varsity football would
have meant that the students who
wanted to play could not do so
here, for intramural tackle foot-
ball is clearly impractical. In con-
trast, if varsity basketball should
have to be dropped, the students
who like to play should still have
ample opportunity, as extramural
basketball is flourishing.”

In order to allow the Washington
U. student body to decide on the
future of basketball on campus, the
executive committee of the Board of
Trustees has proposed a_yet-to-be-
authorized referendum, in which stu-
dents will vote whether or not to pay
a $10 per person athletic fee for the
| maintenance of the basketball pro-
gram. The committee has stated that
an 80 per cent favorable response
from the 3600 undergraduates will be
required for passage of the referen-
dum.

hit on a 15-foot jumper to boost the
home team’s margin to five, but
Cartwright knocked it back down to
three on a lay-up. Frankie Allen’s
free throw gave the Maroons a 56-52
bulge and set up the turning point of
the game, as the Generals missed three
consecutive shots underneath follow-
ing an off-the-mark Wesselink jumper.

Roanoke then got possession and
called time-out with 2:48 remaining.
They moved to a six-point lead on a
goal-tending call on Neer, and in the
final two minutes, outscored the Gen-
erals 12-6 to annex the 70-58 victory,

High-point man for Roanoke was
freshman reserve guard Gene Luna,
who came off the bench to score 23
points for the Maroons. High scorer
for the Generals was Mike Neer with
19. Neer also led W&L in rebounds,
snaring 14 caroms,.

The Generals take their 14-2 record
to Norfolk tonight to face the highly-
regarded Monarchs of Old Dominion
in a battle of national small-college
statistical leaders. The Monarchs, who
are 15-4 and have previously beaten
Roanoke and lead the Mason-Dixon
Conference Southern Division, are
the eighteenth ranked small-college
five in the team offense department,
averaging over 97 points a game. The
Generals, on the other hand, are
seventh ranked in team defense, hav-
ing allowed only 62.4 points a game
to their opponents.

As neither team is currently rank-
ed in the small-college standings,
both see it as a “must” game to vault
into national prominence, as well as
the key battle in the contest for the
Virginia Small-College crown.

battle.

Vietnam

Sen, Morton, who has been known
as a “dove” in the Vietnam question
said that he and some of his Senate
colleagues had held back their criti-
cism of the war because of possible
miscalculation by the Hanoi govern-
ment of the American will to see the
war through to its conclusion.

“I hope,” Sen. Morton said, “Gen.
Westmoreland and others are right
when they say this is their (the Viet
Cong’s) last breath.”

“We haven't won the hearts and
minds of the people today,” he said.
“Until they show a greater will to
resist in this civil war, | don’t know
what we should do.”

Sen. Morton suggested eliminating
the “search and destroy” missions,
and concentrating on pacification pro-
grams. He also said we should stop
the strategic bombing of North Viet-
nam and concentrate on tactical bomb-
ing support for troops and bombing
of Communist supply lines, such as
the Ho Chi Minh trail.

Bombing of cities like Warsaw,
London and Rotterdam during the
Second World War, Morton pointed
out, only strengthened the resistance
of the people. The Republican posi-
tion on the war in Vietnam will be
largel ydetermined by the GOP presi-
dential nominee.

the first time he competed in an in-

tercollegiate swimming meet, that
occasion on Dec. 2 when the Gen-
erals opened their season against

American University in Washington,
D.C.

A week later in Lexington against
Gettysburg College, Brumback’s 500-
yard freestyle time of 5:25.5 set both
pool and school records.

In the later meet, Brumback’s 50-
year freestyle time of 20.8 lowered
by two-tenths of a second a record
that had stood since 1940,

Finally, he set two more marks
Jan. 8 when W&L met Randolph-
Macon at the Yellow Jackets’ pool—
a 1:59.5 clocking for the 200-yard-
freestyle and a 52.1 time for the
100-yard freestyle (both were pool
records),

\ there is so much localism.” He ad-

problem of unemployment has de-
veloped. As mayor, McKeldin fought
to break down racial barriers in Balti-
more. He secured many jobs for un-
employed Negroes and was with them
constantly during the summer months |
trying to avert riot. He summed it
up by saying, “the Negroes are my
friends.”

In a panel discussion afterward,
Gov. McKeldin was questioned about
his support of President Lyndon
Johnson in the 1964 Presidential elec-
tion. He answered by saying, Re-
publican or not, he was stil lan
American and could not vote for a
man who would not support a civil
rights bill, The first Republican gov-
ernor of Maryland in many years
also stated that he would support
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller for this
year’s Republican presidential nomi-
nee.

In discussing the differences between
the two major parties, McKeldon said
that he saw none. Many Republicans
vote for Democratic proposals and
Democrats support Republican pro-
posals. In addition, a politician’s party
policies are often determined by his
constituents’ races, creeds and other
factors.

Hess

(Continued from page 1)
of Government. He has previously
served as special assistant to Presi-
dent Eisenhower and as an assistant
to the Senate Minority Whip.

Concerning the Republican presi-
dential hopefuls, Hess said, “Nixon's
main problem is that he is not start-
ing from scratch, but with the scars
of 20 years of political life.” Later he
observed that “the only way Nixon
can get the nomination is to establish
himself as a winner.”

Romney and Nixon currently have
the advantage over other candidates,
according to Hess, since they have
already declared their candidacy.
Also, Romney, Rockfeller and Percy
have the most to offer “in terms of
image appeal.” However, Hess felt
that Rockefeller’s candidacy might be
bad for the party, since “if one po-
tential candidate can re-open the
wounds of 1964, it is most likely to
be Rockefeller.”

On Republican hopes in Congress,
Hess foresaw “a modest gain in the
Senate—perhaps eight seats.” Republi-
can control of the House, now only
31 seats away, is a possibility, but
Hess could not “really tell, because

mitted that “in a sweep the Republi-
cans could take control of the House.”

Hess observed many “innovative
elements” in the Republican Party.
He reported = that “considerable
thought has been given to the pos-
sibility of a volunteer army,” and
that “any Republican president would
try to end the war in Vietnam.”

No. It is dog food. The Vietnamese
will eat it if they get their hands
on it.

This is Lt. X wandering around the
yard. He trips over a box. He has
been tripping over that same box for
days, and the Colonel keeps asking
what is in it. Lt. X doesn’t know.
Clearly action is called for! A look
of grim determination steals over the
lieutenant’s face. Decision wells up|
in his eyes. He picks up the box and)
drops it behind a stack of bigger)
boxes. Now it is out of his way and |
the Colonel will never see it. Well
done, Lt. X.

Now our hero and all these other |

officers are leaving the yard. They |
are on their way to this big meet-|
ing. Every day at this time, they have
this big meeting.

Here we are inside the big meeting
room. Col. Z and Maj. Y are doing
all the talking. I can’t understand what
they are talking about, but then I am
not a highly trained supply expert
like Lt. X. It is obvious that he
understands every word. He is asleep.
in fact, all the. officers are asleep
except Col. Z and Maj. Y. Such is
the electric atmosphere in which high
level policy decisions are made.

Now the day is over, and Lt, X
is free to go to his hut, where he
will get moderately drunk and crawl
into bed, praying that there won't be
an alert to mess with his sleep.

So ends another day in the life
of Lt. X, the man behind the man
behind the man with the gun. Not
a glamorous life, you may say, nor
an exciting one, and probably a
pretty rotten subject for a TV show.
But ask yourself this question: where)

 

 

would our country be without him in| |

Vietnam?

We don’t know. And neither does)
he. But you better believe he is will-

(Continued from page 2)

The Young Republican National
Federation is a case in point. This
group of conservative young Ameri-
cans—over half a million strong—
have taken the original Goldwater
philosophy and given it a new direct-
ion. The principles are still the same,
but the new emphasis is on efficient
organization and a_ unified party
effort. The dedication is still con-
servative, but 1964 was an educa-
tional experience, and the primary
objective this year is to win,

Barry Goldwater, more than any
other man, has been responsible for
this Republican resurgence. So while

a head of lettuce. This is the first
time in our 32 years of married life
I've ever heard my wife complain
about anything.”

After all, Barry is really just a
country boy in the American tradi-
tion, who was born in a log cabin.
But as our honest Barry says it, “I
had it moved to Phoenix, and except
for some air conditining, a swimming
pool, a bowling alley, a bar, a shoot-
ing range, and a golf course, it re-
mains the simple log cabin it always
was,”

But Barry’s wonderful insight into
important issues can only be re-
vealed by his attitude toward the
war in Vietnam. Mr. Goldwater would
like to escalate the war, because he
feels that “no argument is ever won,
no sale is ever made, no point is
ever made without escalation.” That
seems to be a logical assessment of
the problem. Apparently Mr. Gold-

| water was not satisfied with LBJ’s

four years past, let them reflect upon |
the fact that the very victory they |

celebrate has fanned the flames of

their own destruction. We have Barry |

it might be interesting to consider

Village of Ben Suc was bulldozed flat
by our troops. The following ac-
count is by a reporter who talked
to some of the Ben Suc villagers at
their refugee camp: “I asked them
whether, if the war ended, they would
stay in their spotless new village or
go back to Ben Suc, which they knew
had been wiped from the face of
the earth. They said they would
return—to plant rice and to be near
the tombs of their ancestors. What if
the VC were there? They said they
would not return to Ben Suc in that
case. This made them appear to be
anti-VC, as was triumphantly pointed
out to by a listening AID man, So
I asked them why they wouldn't re-
turn to Ben Suc if the VC were
there: Because the Americans would
come back and destroy the village
again.”

Mr. Goldwater attempted to realize
these ambitions when he tried to get
into the Vietnam war as a major-
general in the Air Force. And prob-
ably Barry’s most astute observation
on the war in Vietnam came when
he admitted after his bid was turned
down by the Air Force: “I can see
their point. They need more major-
generals out here like a bull needs
four tits.” No, whatever Barry is, he
is not a killer, and Vietnam does not
need more of them.

Goldwater,

Political Columnist Forsees
Nixon Convention Win

By STEVE WITTMANN

Political analyst Robert D. Novak
conducted a seminar in the law school
Saturday as part of the Contact
program. Novak discussed the com-
ing presidential elections in a ques-
tion-and-answer period.

Novak is a columnist for the
Chicago Sun Times, and his column
“Inside Report” is syndicated in 160
newspapers five times weekly.

The question “Who will get the
Republican nomination next summer?”
opened the seminar. Novak said that
he thought Nixon would get the
nomination, but that Gov, Rocke-
feller had the best chance of defeat-
ing President Johnson. He added that
Nixon has a chance of winning the
election because of Johnson's current
unpopularity. Novak feels that Gov.
Romney has no chance for the nomi-
nation,

Nixon's Chances

Questioned about Nixon's chances
for nomination, Novak said that Nixon
must win all the primaries to get
national confidence and consequently
the nomination, Nixon must also come
up in the polls and close gaps of 7-
10% between his popularity and)
Rockefeller’s and that of the Presi-
dent’s. A loss in any of the primaries
will seriously endanger Nixon's
chances for the nomination.

When asked about the “New Nix-|
on,” Novak replied that Nixon feels |
that if he cracks a few jokes from
the podium his popularity will soar.
Novak said this is not true. Nixon
is more relaxed and projects a bet-
ter image than he did in 1960, and
consequently he is more popular
now. But this does not efface the
fact that he must make ground against |
LBJ. Novak feels that Nixon should |
say that he feels the war is a dis-|
aster and that he wants to do some- |
thing about it. |

Because of the Viet Nam War, |
Johnson slipping in popularity; |
Bobby Kennedy and the Republicans, |
especially Rockefeller, are climbing.
Novak said that Rockefeller has no
professed policy, and so his is re-
garded as a “do-it-yourself” policy: |
that is, the people decide for them-
selves what they think Rockefeller

thinks, and so he maintains support

Lubell And Novak End
Contact’s Pachyderm Symposium

Romney: ‘Ambiguity,’
According To Poll-Taker
By LARRY HONIG

Self-styled newspaperman and “non-
professor” from Columbia University
Samuel Lubell spoke Saturday after-
noon on the Republican party—its
troubles, current status, future pos-
sibilities; and he set forth some con-
clusions about the American political
system in general.

Lubell said that the G.O.P. was in
better stead with the nation now than
it was in 1964, but that the party's
current popularity may be due too
much to the dissatisfaction with Presi-
dent Johnson.

Must Understand Change

The Republican presidential candi-
date must, emphasized the short and
quick-witted speaker, understand the
processes of change which are to-
day so much a part of American
society. And an understanding of the
essence of change, said Lubell, should
not automatically suggest the spend-
ing of more money, as he feels the
administration is now doing,

Lubell, agreeing with Barry Gold-
water, noted that the G.O.P. must

offer an alternative to the Democratic |

leadership—but it must be timely.
The people must be expected to make

more an dmore decisions, as opposed |

to increasing governmental control.
Goldwater's Difficulty

According to Lubell, Goldwater
defeated himself on two counts: first,

| he had solutions for too many prob-

lems, which by necessity alienated a
lot of voters; and second, he did not
know how to handle people

Extrapolating these disadvantages
to the upcoming campaign, Lubell said
that the Republican candidates must
be a man who is intelligent and can
manipulate a lot of facts, ideas, and
problems without losing sight of the
overall picture.

Unification Needed

“What is needed is some man, some
party, some program to unite the
country,” Lubell continued, since
“every eletcion is a test for the uni-
fication of the country.”

He said that the candidate who can
so unite the country is at a disad-
vantage because both parties currently

suffer from too much _ ideology.

Ideology is to Lubell a fixed position,

which simply will not work in
present society of change

Goldwater’s Conservatism:
Apple Pie and Motherhood
By BILL WILKERSON

In a speech distinguished more by
comment than by content, Barry Gold-
water lambasted President Johnson,
Republican liberals, Robert McNa-
mara, Gov. Rockefeller, Gov. Romney
and the American press, The only
things left sacred were apple pie,
motherhood, and the American flag
(which rises electronically overy
morning over the Goldwater adobe
home.)

The major thread of Goldwater's
argument was that the platform used
in the 1964 convention reflected no
major differences from the Republi-
can platform of 1960 and was, in
fact, a strengthening of the basically
liberal positions of that document
Mr. Goldwater somehow seemed to
fail to “out-liberal” the liberals.

Mr. Goldwater, in his speech, con-
tinued his effort to commit the Re-
publican Party to a policy of con-
servatism that would disappear to con-
demn it to a constant position as
an also-ran and would help the two-
| party system by killing it.

 

Platform Similarities
The similarities between the plat-
forms were described as follows:
“In foreign policy, both took a
hard line against Communist aggres-

sion. Both linked the freedom of
America to the future of free nations
in Europe, Latin America, Africa, the
Middle East and Asia... In domestic
matters, both platforms were equally
pledged to the development of indi-
vidual capabilities. Both were pledged
to making government live within its
means. Both demanded priorities for
spending. Both were opposed to deficit
spending except in times of national
emergency.”

In the imbroglio of civil rights,
Goldwater asserted that the 1964 plat
form strengthened the position of the
1960 platform in the rights of mi

had raised the cost for a performance
up very rapidly even within the last

For example, the Four Tops, which
$2300 last year, now can de-

risen almost as dramatically,
with many increasing their prices as

On an operating budget of $32,000,
it is very difficult to provide 8 nights

THE RING-TUM PHIL

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s 'wice-Weekly Newspaper

Tuesday, February 13, 1968

To the other E. C.

We hope that last night’s Executive Committee (of the student
body) resolutions regarding the Mock Convention—the dec-
laration of the extraordinary quality of the quadrennial affair,
and the request that Mr. Saunders be permitted to retain official
management of it (because he would have to, anyway, un-
officially, and everybody knows it)—will be accepted by the
Executive Committee (of the faculty) as being fair and in the
unquestionable best interests of Washington and Lee.

 

The (Un) Co-op

More this year than before, it seems, there is a general dis-
satisfaction, here and elsewhere, with the prices demanded for
textbooks in college bookstores. Newspapers at other schools
have almost unanimously printed exposes written by students
of outrageous markups, and lame refutations written by the
booksellers. Now comes the Ring-tum Phi to ask, Is it necessary
for our University-owned textbook shop to charge $6.25 for
a 300-page paperback?

A couple of incidents, in addition to the general first-of-
the-semester murmur of discontent, make us question whether

prices couldn’t be a little bit lower. We saw one student pay |

$9 for an English text, go outside, and open the book up to
find this notice pasted by the publisher on the inside front
cover: “Dear Mr. Book-Dealer: This book is sent to you with
our compliments. List price: $7.95.” Everybody has experi-
enced, or at least heard tell of, similar instances. The ultimate,
perhaps, involved the group of students who discovered it
was cheaper for them to buy, collectively, one copy of the text
and then each of them xerox it, than for each of them to buy
a separate copy.

The University long ago quit calling the supply store a
“co-op.” The reason is obvious. The necessity of it is not.

Wayward Traveller

The Lexington News-Gazette printed this little item last week:
“A good many people have wanted to know in the past few
years what had been done with the bones of Traveller, Gen-
eral Lee’s horse, which were formerly in a room of the museum
in the basement of Lee Chapel. Information comes from Wash-
ington and Lee that the skeleton is in storage beneath a fresh-
man dormitory.”

Not long ago, a Weekly-Reader-type magazine published
for school children by the National Geographic Society de-
voted a page to Traveller. They weren’t very enthusiastic at
all in reporting that neither the remains of Traveller nor a
suitable monument can be seen by visitors to this University.

Presumably, Traveller’s exile is the result of the want of
room in Lee Chapel (where the skeleton was on display until
the renovation of the Chapel six years ago), and/or the crass
maudlinness of showing off the bones of any animal who has
been dead for 96 years. There is, after all, some difference
(and certainly not wrongly so) between people’s emotive re-
actions to Traveller and to a common brontosaurus.

Even both of last year’s Ring-tum Phis felt something
ought to be done. One editor suggested interring Traveller
close by the Chapel and erecting an appropriate marker; the
other editor said that if something of that order cannot be done,
perhaps we ought to give the bones away to some respectable
institution where their presence would be appreciated more than
it apparently is here.

Come what may, though: as long as Traveller remains
relegated with the infirmary to the bottom of the new fresh-
man dorm, there will be no peace for Stephen Vincent Benet,
who wrote in 1929;

Comes Traveller and his master.

... They bred such horses in Virginia then,
Horses that were remembered after death
And buried not so far from Christian ground.

This week, we turn from “The
Great H--1 Scandal of 1897” (Dec.
5) to less troublesome matter (wine,
women and song), as chronicled in
the Ring-tum Phi before the turn
of the century, Second in a series,

In 1899, Randolph-Macon Woman's
College was only eight years old
(imagine pre-1891 W&L without either
R-MWC or the R-t P!). The one
infant, nevertheless, felt moved to
write of the other: “Out of about 200
students, there are only five full grad-
uates, which speaks well for the high
standard, Oh, my! what can
| we say? They are the ‘all rightest’
girls we have seen, and we will call
again, when W. & L. U. goes to
Lynchburg to play Harvard.”

One is led to suspect that this
may be a reaction to the previous
year’s editorial bent, when under the
headline “A Warm Debate On A
Hackneyed Subject,” the Ring-tum
Phi wrote, “The topic was, ‘Resolved:
That it is better to have loved and
lost, than never to have loved at all.’
The judges announced their decision
in favor of the affirmative. How the

Yes, it was a very good year. “One
| Professor, we see, has a nice patent
| swing, except that the swing is lack-
ing. This is the result of the kindly
| forethought of some student who was
‘anxious, lest one of his instructors
should contract consumption, while
thoughtless staying out too late in his
swing some chilly fall afternoon.
That is the way so many of our people
come to their death, so we encourge
such kindly regard... .”

Successors to Gordon Houston,

Thomas J. Farrar (1898-1899; who,
incidentally, went on to earn one
of the few Ph.D.s ever awarded
by this University), J. Randolph
Tucker (1899-1900) and William J.
Lauck (1900-1901). We dared not
check to see whether Ring-tum Phi
editors Messrs. Farrar, Tucker and
Lauck were kin to the Farrar,
Tuckers and Lauck who later on
and even now are highly placed in
University officialdom.

was so realistic, a typical Ring-tum
Phi review would tell, “that Mr. Barc-
lay found himself at a loss for words,
until a loud whisper, from the back
of the stage, recalled him to his
thespiatic task.”

But the real fun was to be found
in the fraternities. “The Delta Tau
Delta Entertainment,” a headline
would read, or, “The Sigma Nus.”
“On Tuesday night of this week, the
Sigma Nu Hall was the scene of a
very merry gathering. The Sigs,
prompted by their desire to maintain
their reputation for hospitality, gave
in honor of their young lady-friends
a progressive jinks party; a person hav-
ing merely a hearing acquaintance
with the game would, in all prob-
ability, pronounce it rather namby-
pamby; but no such characteristics
were visible on this occasion,

“We regret the occurrence,” the
Ring-tum Phi piously continued, “but
feel it our duty to say, that while
the game was in progress, consider-
able ‘underhand’ work was deteced.
... Miss Nettie Houston demonstrat-
ed herself the most progressive young

photography was also indulged in;
some very ‘touching’ scenes were ob-

tained,”

A minor crisis arose in 1899 when
certain copies of Harper's Weekly,
Cosmopolitan and McClure’s maga-
zines were found to be missing: it
was announced that the librarian was
quite upset, and would not allow stu-
dents or faculty to read any more
magazines until the missing ones were
returned, because otherwise there
would be gaps when they were bound
into annual volumes.

A more major crisis arose the next
year, after a “venerable and venerated
lady” was knocked down by a speed-
ing bicyclist on one of the campus
walks. “The Faculty of the Uni-
versity have made a law,” this news-
paper chastised, “that the walks of
the campus shall not be used for
bicycling. ...

“It is believed that every intelligent
student and every reasonable person
will recognize the propriety of this
law, and observe it, in the future.”
The article, by the way, carried a
by-line: “Wheelman.”

The Ring-tum Phi had been born |

the very month Wililam Lyne Wilson
was inaugurated as President of the
University. There is no evidence that
the newspaper existed under his per-
sonal sufferance, but it did shy away
from making any comment whatever
on the University’s administration.
President Wilson seems to have
spent something less than all his time
in Lexington. The R-t P reported from

When he was in town, he gathered

Wednesday morning for compulsory
chapel, where he delivered seemingly
endless diatribes against everything
from trains to speaking ill of Con-
gressmen and cabinet officers (he had
been in Congress 14 years, served as
Postmaster-General for three).

On October 3, 1900, William L.
Wilson must have known he had
precious little time remaining to him
on this mortal sphere; he rolled all his
“anti-speeches” into one gigantic
harangue.

“The students that were at chapel

(In fairness, we suppose, it ought
to be added that despite Wilson's
apparent extreme sense of Morality
and Christianity and Right and
Wrong, and despite the fact that he
lasted just three years, he did endow
“from his modest means” a chair in
economics for W&L; and his death
brought us upwards of $100,000 from
his friends, including Grover Cleve-
land, who established a William L.
Wilson Fund which was in turn used
to establish the School of Commerce
and Administration.)

Thus endeth the century; thus
endeth the era. Our next install-
ment in the series—which follows
a random rather than chonological
order—will discuss the Ring-tum

Law School's Legal Research Association

 

Students Rescue The

By LARRY HONIG

An attorney in nothern Virginia
recently acted as the seller's lawyer
in a land transaction. The real estate
agent, who normally takes his com-
mission out of the deposit placed by
the buyer, turned the entire deposit
over to the seller in this case.

After the sale was completed, the
seller refused to pay the agent his
commission, so the agent is suing the
seller's attorney for payment. Sound
complicated?

The lawyer thought so too, and he
turned to the Legal Research As-
sociation of the Law School for help.

“Pretty Good Bargain”
In what is described as a “a pretty

| sood bargain” for the attorney, two
| or three law students here at WAL
| will undertake an exhaustive five-week
| study of both aspects of the case to
try to find a legal precedent by which
| the lawyer himself will not be liable
| for the commission,

| The prestigious Legal Research As-
| sociation, under Chairman Michael
| Michaeles, is often called on by Vir-
| ginia attorneys to research complicated
points of law which may take the
| lawyer himself too much time or for
| which no common law precedent is
obvious,

A Little More Space, Perhaps?

By RIC BERARD

Dear Larry,

Following last Tuesday's poor
sport page, it seemed that something
should be done to remedy the de-
teriorating content
and format of our
section of the
paper. Thus, while
my articles in the
past have been re-
lated to athletics,
today’s column is
primarily concern-
ed with the pub-
lication in this
edition of its sports
news,

As you know,
Larry, it is my belief that athletics at
any school, but particularly at Wash-
ington and Lee, offers the greatest
source of school identity. Unfortun-
ately, this potential unifying factor
is being suppressed in two ways: the
first is the editorial opinion of this
paper and the excessive amount of
weekly advertisements; and then, the
lethargy that exists among members
of the Committee on Athletics and
the administration of Doremus, While
| wish that I could do something
about the latter, such is not possible
within the status-quo-monolith here.
Therefore, my primary concern is with
this edition and the sale of advertis-
ing.

While all the current difficulty may
simply be a lingering reaction to the
early fifties, the problem is no less
real. It is my hope that those of us
on the R-t P staff work to give athletics
at W&L, and W&L itself, new blood.
As things are now, that simply isn’t
possible.

For example, the editor of this
issue has frequently been overheard
saying, “Listen, I don’t care what
you do to the third page.” I believe
that, too often, this attitude is ap-
parent. With a dearth of writers, this
pages somehow pulled together each
week through the efforts of two or
three people. Unfortunately, what
little is accomplished is frequently
abbreviated because of the fantastic
amount of advertising on both pages
three and four, Frequently, each Ring-
tum Phi contains less than three pages
of pictures and type. And under
existing conditions, the sports page is
the first to be “trimmed.”

What this means is that, although
we do have an I-M columnist, my
weekly blurb and regular reporting,

the columns are frequently emascu-
lated in order to print a part of each
and then the remaining segments can
only be found by searching between
the ads, Also, format, per se, is non-
existent. Frankly, I find such a situa-
tion untenable.

In addition, too many men go
out and kill themselves at W&L for
little if any recognition. At present,
unless you play on the basketball
team, no one could ever accuse you
of being a glory hound, But every
athlete deserves more news coverage
than what we can now provide. With
so little recognition, you virtually have
to be an isolate to get something out
of many “team” sports. Although |
admire the spirit that drives these
people on in face of adversity, such
a situation should not be allowed to
prevail. It’s unfair to the athletes
and the University. And so, | am ask-
ing the Publications Board, as well as
the editor of this paper, to do some-
thing about this as soon as possible,

With more space on the third
page and with a somewhat consistent
layout, the persons working on the
sports staff would be given greater
freedom and an opportunity for
creativity. For example, at this time,
there simply isn’t room for an inter-
view with the Director of Athletics-
elect, Lee McLaughlin. Or more cor-
rectly, such an article would preempt
any other sports news of the week.
Yet I believe such additions to the
page are not only “news” but of
interest—a combination we frequently
assume but rarely achieve.

Nothing can be done to rectify the
situation, however, until there is a
significant decrease in the inches of
advertising. If it is true, as the editors
say, that the sale of space offers
the two papers their only hope of
breaking even each year, then I sug-
gest something be done immediately
to increase the subsidization by the
Publications Board for the two issues
(a committee which | have been told
has several thousand dollars sitting
in the bank.) For even if this means
taxing the students a dollar or two
more each year—something which
might be achieved simply by “ad-
justing” the current budget—I believe
most of the student body would be
amenable to such an increase. But
something should be done, starting
this year, to insure an adequate pub-
lication of sports news.

This publication is in the position
to help the University to a healthier
campus attitude, and I don't believe |
the goal is beyond our reach. 1 think |
we should at least try.

For unless a change occures, we!
are going to lose what good people |
we currently have at Doremus, and |
we shall have stunted part of W&L’s
future before it is even given a chance.
1 would hate to think that we, the
students, are still so entrenched.

Well, Kid, let me know how your
exams turned out. And good luck
during your second semester in Spain.

Cagers Take On Hornets Here Tonight

The Generals, still suffering from
the long exam week lay-off, lost their
third contest of the season Friday
night to Old Dominion by a score of
78-70. The tide turned on Saturday
night however, as the Generals came
back to down Greensboro 103-68.
The weekend's action brought the
Generals’ record to 15-3.

 

Against Old Dominion the Generals
had several opportunities to win but
couldn’t get the offense to match the
fine defensive effort. There were 17
turnovers that cost the Generals a
total of 27 points and several missed
lay-ins. According to Coach Canfield
it was the turnovers that cost us this
victory but the team played admir-

 

 

Player of

In the past week the Gen-
erals’ three big men have
turned in their usual fine
performances and it was
quite difficult to choose one
from among them. How-
ever, because of his per-
formance against Old Do-
minion, this week’s selection
is Mike Neer. Against ODC
Mike earned 25 points and
got 14 rebounds and did a
good job on defense. Mike
has led the scoring in the
last three outings and is cur-
rently averaging better than
18 points per game.

The Generals face West Virginia
Wesleyan this afternoon in Doremus
Gymnasium, They then face Loyola |
Friday night in Lexington and finish
with a tough meet against the Uni-
versity of West Virginia a week from
today in their home pool before travel-
ing to St. Louis to compete in the
CAC’s.

Billy Ball, Pat Costello, Dave
Kympton and Ross Forman provided |
the winning combination that set the)
mediey relay record at 3:59.9. Ball
also won the 50-yard freestyle with
a time of 23.5 seconds, Ball's third)
trimuph of the afternoon after he
won the 200-yard backstroke event

 

with a time of 2:15.9. Junior Bill

Kimmel scored a third in the back-
stroke event.

Freshman flash Bill Brumback won
victories in both the 200 freestyle
and the 100 freestyle. Ross Forman

la

second behind Brumback’s 52.6-

Garten captured a second in the 1000-

a winning time of 2:34.1, while fresh-
man Joe Philips came in third. Co-
captain Noel Glinard and freshman
diving ace Mike Carrere went one-two
in the diving.

The Generals’ meet this Friday
against Loyola is one they hope to
win. Last year in the Loyola pool,
the Generals lost by a razor-thin
margin, and they hope to even the
score Friday.

 

Mal Wesselink, guard?

No, the Generals do not have a

new 6S” guard. It's only Mal Wesse
link bringing the ball down court
during Roanoke’s full court press

Wesselink, however, played guard in|

high school and handles the ball ex
tremely well for a big man. Uf by
chance the Generals acquire another
forward next year, Wesselink may be
considered at Kline's replacement.

Intramural Wrap-up
By GEORGE McFARLAND

The regular 1.M. basketball season
is all but ended. PDT, PKS and NFU
are sure to be in the finals. SAE and
SN are still fighting for their league
championship. SAE should win. As
soon as the make-up games are com-
pleted, the finals will begin. Once the
finals begin it wil be fun to see if
anyone can catch PDT on an off
night. Odds are that it cannot be
done.

Handball and bowling are progess-
ing with high participation. NFU
looks like the team to beat in the
alleys. Why did they eliminate the
faculty from I.M. participation? Think
ot the handball team they could have
fielded. Who could have beat them?

Just a few words now on my the
I.M. program is so popular and im-
portant. It is popular because it meets
several needs. One need is to be active
and to compete. Only in the 1M.
program can you compete actively and
completely, yet in a_ basically un-
threatening way.

Another need that 1.M. program
meets is the desire to belong. Strong
friendships develop from 1.M. com-
petition which provides opportunities
for students to work as a team rather
than in the more isolated competitive
ways of academic life. The LM. pro-
gram also brings people into con-
fact, sometimes violent, with each
other when no opportunity is avail-
able. Let's face it, for a small campus
there is a high degree of insulated
groups that never associate with one
another, The insulation is sometimes
violently destroyed in the 1M. sports
program.

Moral: get out there and partici-
pate. You may get a chance to re-

 

| lieve the tension, boredom or isola-

tion that causes evertyhing from
pimples to .9 cumulatives,

| wought. No radically new proposals

the ‘64 platform. The only strong
position was that the government
ought to enforce the laws to guarantee
the right to vote. If the present laws
had failed, the Republicans offered
no better law and seemed even to
regard (per Goldwater's vote on the
Civil Rights Law of 1964) the present
law as unconstitutional,
Candidate Analysis

Goldwater continued with an
analysis of the Republican candidates
and their collective and respective
chances of victory. In response to
questions, Goldwater agreed that the
Republicans should nominate a man
who could win the election. He stated
| that Nixon could do so, despite the
present poll situation that shows Nix-
on trailing Johnson. He cited the polls
| in his campaign in 1964 that showed
| him behind Johnson 4-1 at the be-
| ginning of the race. (It probably would
| have been best for him to pay at-
tention to the polls.)
| Goldwater commented that any
Republican would have been de-
feated in 1964 (and this has an atmos-
| phere of speculation). The stigmata
| of such a loser as the presidential
| candidate may have hindered the
| election of other Republican candi-
| dates, and, indeed, the big Republican
winners were those who denied as-
sociation with Goldwater.

To all [this fraternity | political
aspirants

In anticipation of the forthcoming
ithis house, of which the writer once

ber of candidates for various and
sundry positions have requested my
oratorical services (apparently gained
through public services and retired
statesmanship) in support of their re-
spective candidacies,

Taking into consideration the facts
of 1) examintion confusion, 2) «
seeming lack of candidates at this
early stage of the campaign, 3) my
own indecision as to whom my in-
fluence (777) should be availed [sic],
I would request all who have or are
planning to solicit my services to
| please wait until Feb. 7 (to give my
Isic] two days to recompose my self
from F. D.) te talk to me.

Hopefully, by then, the various
candidates will be sufficiently an.
nounced so that I can muke some
completely arbitrary decision on whom
I will support.

Thanking you vey much, I am.

Campaigningly yours.

Chicago—A Mistake?

Novak said that the Democratic
Convention being in Chicago seems
on the surface to be a major mistake.
The city has poor communications
and internal problems. But the con-
vention is scheduled there as a polit-
ical favor to Mayor Daley. Johnson's
advisors, Novak stated, feel that Chi-

The peace marches, race riots, and
hippies, all protesting LBJ, will ac-
tually help his popularity in the
reaction that should set in.

Shriver vs. Dirksen

Novak said that Sargent Shriver
could win a Senate Seat in Hlinois
with a hard, vigorous campaign to

that Dirksen is “losing his touch”
and may lose his post as minority
leader in the Senate

Romney and Morality

Lubell said that Gov. George Rom-
ney suffers from “moral ambiguity,”
since he is in a good position because
of the fact that there is a war. The
existence of the war causes people
to turn to the more “moral” candi-
date to ease their consciences on the
morals of war.

As far as his personal preference
for a Republican nominee is con-
cerned, Lubell declined to comment
| since he takes polls—personally—and
would prefer only to discuss politics
| and its general relation to society.

Fine Arts Instructor Boyd
Named Department Head
At Wake Forest University

Dr. Sterling M. Boyd will leave
his post as instructor in the fine
arts department here in June to ac-
cept the chairmanship of the same
department at Wake Forest Univer-
sity in Winston-Salem, North Caro-
lina,

He is the first acquisition of that
school in the development of their
fine arts department. Although he
will be the only fine arts professor
there next year, Dr. Boyd says that
the number of professors will hope-

| fully expand to seven over a period

of years. According to Boyd, the
staff will eventually include four in-
structors in art history and three in
studio art.

Dr. Boyd came to W&L four years
ago after earning a Ph.D. in Amer-
ican architecture from Princeton
University. He completed his under-
graduate studies at the University
of the South at Sewanee, getting a
B.S. in political science. Turning
to architecture, he then received M.A.
and M.S. degrees from Oberlin Col-
lege in Ohio.

Symposium Week--Il

Elsewhere on this page appears a letter drawing attention,
as we did in an editorial last week, to the over-emphasis in
intellectual activities at W&L—at last on the formal, public
level—on political and sociological topics of discussion. The
letter suggests, as we did, that excursions into the arts and
sciences are not “irrelevant” to the intellectual experience of
a liberal arts college (or, we would add, to that of any other
educational institution). We would like to hope, how-
ever, that the future of symposiums here is not so grim as
the letter suggests.

Last week we praised the Glasgow Endowment Committee
for what we termed its courage and good sense in undertaking
to sponsor a major symposium in the full realization that it
would not draw major crowds. We did make one error: con-
trary even to our own expectations, attendance at the lectures
on Shakespeare has been very high— indicating, we hope, that
CONTACT need not fear a lack of student interest if it

chooses to do the same sort of thing.

The Shakespeare symposium has demonstrated that Iago
can justly vie with Goldwater. We particularly remember one
scene from this weekend, as an illustration that questions of
controversy and concern do not have to be political and
social: the speaker who rushed up to the podium after hearing
another speaker's talk, declaring with anguish, ‘But what
have you done with the play?” He meant it, too.

To repeat what we said last week (but it bears repetition) :
this year’s Glasgow program has shown us that discussions of
literature in public symposiums here is not only possible but
successful. Presumably, similar topics in the arts and sciences
would have similar success—something we hope the planners

of next year’s CONTACT will take into consideration.

Bonnie And Clyde: ‘Brilliant’

By STEPHEN JOHNSON

Bonnie And Clyde, a_ brilliant,
frightening movie, is easily the best
film of the past year. It was made
by artists who un-
derstood their ma-
terial perfectly and
it is because of
this understanding,
and because of the
prevalence, among

the meaning which those activities
have. Death and pain, theirs or any-
one else’s, are unimaginable to them
and it is only in the last third of the
movie that they have their fingers
pressed upon the painful braille of
the realization of what a bullet in the
flesh feels like. Toward the very end
Bonnie presents a vision of the in-
evitable outcome of their activities

“It has been suggested that

Washington and Lee to extend such
invitations. The invitations were
extended after CONTACT receiv-
ed a number of inquiries from
various schools. To my knowledge
we had on campus at various times
during the symposium delegations
from American University, Catholic
University, Hampton Institute,
Madison College, Mary Baldwin,
Sweet Briar College and the Uni-
versity of Virginia. There may have
been more. It was the large dele-
gation from Sweet Briar that caused
the consternation, and I have writ-

Generals Romp 81-50 i
For Sixteenth Victory 4;

By THUNDER THORNTON

Washington and Lee’s Generals
returned to the friendly confines of
Doremus Gymnasium to begin re-
building a winning streak, defeating
Lynchburg 81-50 Tuesday night. De-
spite the final point spread, the win-
ners couldn’t count on the victory
until a second half surge put them
comfortably in command.

The Hornets grabbed the first led
and kept within from two to four
points throughout most of the early
stages. Using a tight zone and con-
trolling the tempo, the visitors got
good outside shooting from the guards
Mason and McKinney, while the Gen-
erals managed to keep slightly in
front due to balanced scoring and the
floor play of co-captain Jody Kline.

Eight Deadlocks

The score was tied eight time dur-
ing the first half, and the Generals
didn’t achieve their six-point halftime
lead of 35-29 until the final seconds,
when Mel Cartwright netted a three-
point play. The six-point spread was
the largest for either team during the
opening stanza.

While the first half was largely a
disciplined, defensive affair, Coach
Verne Canfield’s charges came out to

set that situation right in the final
period, The Hornets tried to keep the
pace slow, but again it was Kline
who fired his mates, with three straight
baskets, one a tip-in, one a long
jumper, and one a full court dash
for a layup following a steal.

The Generals were off and running
after this one-man display, and soon
the wrecking crew was reorganized,
using the sticky defense and high gear
offense that apparently only the exam
break had slowed down, After John
Carrere duplicated Kline’s theft-and-
basket feat to stretch the lead to 43-
29, Mal Wesselink hit an inside shot
to make it 45-29. Lynchburg got on
the board finally with a free toss
at the 17:19 mark, but couldn’t man-
age a basket until nearly six second
half minutes had elasped.

In the meantime, the Generals had
gained firm control of both boards
over the shorter Hornets, and the
presence of Cartwright, Wesselink,
and Mike Neer took its toll. At the
thirteen-minute mark, Lynchburg
tried to start a comeback of its own

| by utlizing a press that forced three

| straight W&L turnovers, but, although

the play became rather ragged, the

a home meet tonight at 8:00 and
next Tuesday before flying to St.
Louis and competing in the CAC,
Billy Ball and Bill Brumback led
the charge winning two events each.
Ball captured the 200-yard backstroke
with a winning time of 2:09.1 in the
W&L 23% yard pool; his other first
came in the 200-yard individual
medley with a time of 2:00.3.
Brumback sped to firsts in the 50-
yard and the 100-yard freestyle events
with winning times of 21.2 and 47.4
respectively. Ross Forman came in a
strong second behind Brumback in
both the freestyle sprints. Other firsts
were garnered by Hal Catlin, Dave
Kympton, and co-captain Pat Costello.
Catlin’s first came in the 200-yard

With twelve minutes left in the hour time limit, Findlay
put down his 41st egg and quit, appearing fairly nonplused,
and indicating that he was “full.’’ With five minutes to go,
Sklar put down a quick 26, and quit, retiring to a conveniently

Sklar went to sleep.

Generals Romp

(Continued from page 3)

Generals maintained their scoring
pace.

Coach Canfield began substituting
at this juncture and the reserves Bill
Rhyne, Earl Edwards, Stu Fauber,
Norwood Morrison, and Charlie Stone
contributed to the final margin. A
drive by Morrison gave the victors
their largest lead at 81-43. The final

surge by the Hornets served only to

make the score look a little more
respectable.
Mel Cartwright was high scorer

for W&L with 21 tallies, followed by
Neer with 18, and Kline with 12.
The rest of the scoring was closely
balanced, as all but one of the Gen-
erals made the scoring column, Lynch-
burg could only manage double figure
efforts from its backcourt tandem,
with Mason scoring 12 and McKinney
14.

Telling figures were the shooting
and rebounding statistics. The Gen-
erals had a good night from the floor,
firing in 34 of 74 for 46 percent.
They also scored 13 of 19 from the
free throw line. Lynchburg, how-
ever, had trouble penetrating the de-
fense of the Big Blue, and saw only
20 of 64 of their long shots go in.
This 31 per cent performance was
not nearly enough, especially since the
vistors were beaten on the boards 58-
38 by the big general front line of
Cartwright, Wesselink, Neer, Ed-
wards, et al.

The victory made W&L’s mark 16-3
and kept their home floor record
perfect for this season. February 20th
will be the final home game date
against Emory and Henry, and Coach
Canfield and his boys would like to
keep good old Doremus unblemished.
Certainly, Lynchburg was left “Profit-
less” after their Doremus encounter,
if you know what I mean.

Rockbridge Concert Series
Presents String Quartet

The third event in this season's
Rockbridge Concert-Theater Series
will take place on Thursday, Febru-
ary 22, 1968. The Lywen String
Quartet will be heard that night at
8:15 p.m. in Jackson Memorial Hall
at the Virginia Military Institute.

The quartet is composed of first
chair players from the Washington
National Symphony which performed
here earlier on the same series.
Werner Lywen, from whom the group
gets its name, is the first violinist.

Other performers are Virginia
Harpham (second violin), Richard
Parnas (viola), and Dorothy Stahl
(cello),

The final event of the season, a
concert by Teresa Stich-Randall,
originally scheduled for April 8, has
been rescheduled for March 15, to
permit Miss Stich-Randal to fulfill
an important European engagement.

sympathy) who helps them take pot-
shots at his foreclosed farm. Even
Blanche, who objects to the activi-
ties of her husband and his brother
more because those activities force
her to lead a way of life that is un-
comfortable and inconvenient than
because of anything intrinsically
wrong with those activities, never

all are forced to experience.

Vision of Human Neglect

The distance I spoke of in the
first paragraph gives a_ peculiar
effectivenss to this vision of human
neglect and responsibility. The con-
text of the film, the good, happy
world which suddenly becomes dang-
erous and frightening, works first to
trap the audience in this conception
of the world as a place inhabited
by cheerful, comfortable people to
whom we are eager and glad to
respond, The movie, in other words,
gives the audience just enough rope
with which to hang themselves. The
last third of the film stands this
happy world on its head and forces
the audience to participate in the
lesson Bonnie and Clyde are learning.
An example of what I mean is the
way in which music is used. The
Flatt and Scruggs tunes at the begin-
ning seem an amenable background
to the comic world on the screen.
When these tunes return again at
the end of the film their former use
is inverted, they are ironic reminders
of what has happened to us, the
audience, in the course of the film.

Bailey Talks On Work Laws

(Continued from page 1)

The National Right to Work Com-
mittee is a coalition of employers and
employees organized in 1955 with a
single purpose: protecting the right
of individual workers to join or not
to join without losing their jobs. The
organization faced its sternest test in
1965 when the advocates of com-
pulsory unionism pressed hard for
the repeal of Section 14(b) of the
Taft-Hartley Act which would legalize
compulsory unionism in all 50 states.
The Committee spearheaded efforts
to save 14(b) and its activities have
been recognized as a major factor
in the success of the battle.

 

Fraternities Plan Initiations

Arvin, Dan Cogan, Alan GaNun,
Charles Ross, John Stafford, Shelby
Weddle, Paul Wilbur, Steve Unti and

party for them this Saturday. On
this list are Jim Allen, Steve Kerkam,
John King, John Klinedinst, Tucker
Lampkin, Kevin O'Grady, John Rode-
meir, Steve Rosenthal, Hartley Roush,
Frank Stearns, Allen Shepard, Andy
White, Roger Young, and Jack Bowie.

Phi Kappa Sigma is planning a ban-
quet for their 13 initiates on March
2 at the Robert E. Lee Hotel. These
include Tim Wright, Steve Gates,
Richard Kimball, Pat Sullivan, George
Stowe, Lawrence Miller, Carl Hyatt,
Danny Webster, Greg Raetz, Chris
Dove, Bill Gatlin, Neil Robinson, and
Steve Denton.

The 11 pledges to be initiated into
Pi Kappa Alpha in connection with
a Sunday banquet include Charles
Andrews, John Ellis, Arthur Cleve-
land, Tom Dashiell, Tom Daniel,
Claude Walker, Bill Kahn, Joe Phil-
lips, George Widener, Joel Fulmer,

Tonight the Generals face Loyola,
who narrowly defeated them last year
in Loyola's pool. Next Tuesday the
Generals face the University of West
Virginia in what promises to be one
of the best meets of the year. W&L
has been able to defate West Vir-
ginia in the past, but this is the first
year that West Virginia has been able
to use freshmen on their team; this
is expected to be a very close meet.

Coach Stearns’ team is building up
a good steam of momentum which
he hopes will carry them to victory in
the CAC a week from now.

various reasons, discontinued sub-
sidized athletics and had decided to
pursue athletic policies more in line
with their enrollments, It has been
an understanding and the prevailing
feeling since then that the basic aims
of the conference have consistently
guided the member schools’ athletic
policies. It is this assumption that, I
feel in light of events of the past few
years, can no longer be taken for
granted, and subsequently, the very
reason for the CAC’s existence can
no longer be defended.

Putting ambiguities aside, this argu-
ment boils down to several specific
sets of circumstances involving the
different member schools and their
policies, First, Washington University
is in a mess and does not know what
it's going to do about it. The school
has no money for a basketball pro-
gram, wants to make money off its
football program, does not have a
football coach for next season, and
in several sports, especially baseball,
it wants to keep a “big-time” image
inconsistent with its CAC member-
ship. All in all, the school's future
as a CAC member is doubtful,

Question

automatic bids to the post-season
NCAA _ small-college tournaments,
and no sixth school is presently in
sight. Because of this rule, the Gen-
erals must compete for “at large”
berths in these events, in which they
run up aginst the Kentucky Wesleyans,
etc. of the small-college world.

Finally, and most seriously, is the
rumor currently circulating around
the conference—and given to this
columnist by a very reliable source—
that all is not over and above board
with the member schools as far as
subsidization is concerned. If athletic
scholarships or their equivalents are
being given, then the CAC is being
destroyed by its own members, and
Washington and Lee is under no
moral obligation to continue its mem-
bership.

In light of all these circumstances,
I feel that it is imperative that the
school presidents and athletic direc-
tors of the member schools meet im-
mediately and lay all their cards on
the table. If, after this occurs, the
powers-that-be at this University de-
cide that the conference no longer is
living up to the ideals or intentions
for which it was founded, plans
should be made for WAL to with-
draw from the conference and seek
its athletic fortune elsewhere.

Thirdly, the CAC has been and
always will be a geographical im-
possibility, Over a thousand miles
separate its castern-most and western-
most members, With the existing
athletic budgets at most of the schools,
regularly scheduled conference games
in sports except football are, to say
the least, improbabilities. The co-

 

hesiveness of traitional rivalries can-
not be obtained on a even basis
throughout the conference, and one-
shot, post-season meetings can never
take the place or excite the interest
of desirable but impossible regular
season play

MORNINGS AT SEVEN...AND
THERE’S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
ABOUT IT

Any man who says morning is the best time of day is
either a liar or a meadow lark.

There is only one way to make morning enjoyable:
sleep till noon. Failing that, the very best you can do is to
make morning tolerable. This, I am pleased to report, is
possible if you will follow three simple rules:

1. Shave properly.

By shaving properly I mean shaving quietly. Don’t use
a blade that whines and complains. Morning being a time
of clanger and anger, use a blade that neither clangs nor
angs. Use a blade that makes no din on your chin, no
squeak on your cheek, no howl on your jowl, no rip on
your lip, no waves while it shaves. Use, in short, Personna

Super Stainless Steel Blades.

I have been shaving for 71 years (not too impressive
until one considers that I am 49 years old) and I am here
to tell you that the quietest blade I know is Personna. I not
only shave with Personna, but I also admire it. Old vir-
tues reappear in Personna; old values are reborn. Per-
sonna is a modest blade, an undemanding blade. Personna
does not rasp and tug, yelling, “Hey, lookit me!” No, sir,
not Personna! Silently, respectfully, unobtrusively, Per-
sonna whisks your whiskers with nary a whisper. It
shucks your soil and stubble without toil and trouble.
Why, you hardly know it’s there, this well-bred Personna
blade, this paragon of punctilio.

Moreover, this crown of the blade-maker’s art, this

epitome of epidermal efficacy,
edge style and Injector style.

2. Breakfast properly.

is available both in Double-
Do your kisser a favor: get

I assert that a Personna shave is the best of all possible
shaves. But I do not assert that a Personna shave, brac-
ing though it may be, is enough to prepare you for the
hideous forenoon ahead. After shaving you must eat an

ample breakfast.

ake, for example, the case of Basil Metabolism, a soph-
omore at V.M.I. Basil, knowing there was to be an inspec-
tion by the Commandant one morning, prepared by stor-
ing up energy. He recognized that coffee and juice would
not sustain him, so he had a flitch of bacon, a clutch of
eggs, a batch of bagels, a notch of ham, a bunch of butter,
a swatch of grits, a hutch of honey, a patch of jelly, a
thatch of jam, a twitch of pepper, and a pinch of salt.

 

The idea was right; the quantities, alas, were not. When
the Commandant arrived, Basil, alas, was so — that

he could not raise his bloated arm in a proper sa

ute. He

was, of course, immediately shot by a firing squad. Today,
a perforated man, he carns a meagre living as a collander

in Cleveland.
3. Read properly.

Always read the paper at breakfast. It inhibits bolting.
But do not read the front page. That is full of bad, acid-
making news. Read a more pleasant part of the paper—
the Home and Garden section, for example,

For instance, in my local paper, The Westport Peasant,
there is a delightful column called “Ask Harry Home-
spun” which fairly bristles with bucolic wisdom and

many an earthy chuckle. |

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

Tuesday, February 20, 1968

 

Player of the year

The Tuesday Edition, which has honored one member of the
basketball team each Tuesday as “Player of the Week” in
recognition of exceptional performances during each seven-day
period, tonight presents its “Player of the Year’ plaque,
given for the most outstanding and consistent season-long per-
formance.

The presentation will directly precede tonight’s Emory
and Henry game, our last home game of the year. Tuesday
Sports Editor Steve Mason has been keeping a systematized
“point” chart all season, with tonight’s presentation in mind.

Nobody who has been to very many of this year’s basket-
ball games will deny, though, that in this case the total is far
greater than the sum of its parts. The team has been superb.
The Coach has been superb. The morale, the obvious close
fellowship among all team members, has certainly been re-
sponsible. Any team which can keep on top as ours has
(and when things go badly, as they did in Roanoke, any team
which right afterwards can come within eight points of Old
Dominion and destroy another team, 103 to 68) has a spirit
that a college can be proud of.

The Ring-tum Phi is proud. And so tonight, when the |

Player of the Year award is presented, keep in mind that it
not only recognizes the contribution of one team member
to W&L’s basketball program. It is a symbolic presentation
to the Team of the Year.

After the flood

May we use the opportunity created by Friday morning's
Troubadour Theatre flood to reiterate our vehement opposi:
tion to the continued existence of the building?

On a lot of matters, the Tuesday Edition’s admittedly con-
servative, even reactionary, attitude is not one of hasty, single-
minded, end-in-itself Change. But when it comes to the Troub
Theatre, that is too much. The situation cries out for almost
any kind of change, because things can’t become much worse.
(Perhaps they could become as bad as they were last year
before the micro-renovation—worse than which does not
exist, we are certain. God keep us from that.)

The University is in the process of prescribing priorities to
its long-range projects; and we are assured that few if any will
be given priority over the construction of a new theatre and
gym. None the less, it seems apparent now, in a post-diluvian
analysis, that the construction of a theatre (the existing build-
ing not qualifying for the dignity of being called a “theatre”’)
needs to be taken out of the long-range program and, as the
student union was, planned and executed immediately. Perhaps
some of the funds given by the “Lee Associates” could be
earmarked for this specific purpose. Certainly, though, some-
thing besides water must be channelled to the Troub Theatre,
very, very soon.

 

Staff editorial:

Eton’s fields

Washington and Lee's equivalent to the playing fields of
Eton—the hillsides of Natural Bridge—has produced leaders
in the past; but to a great extent the success of our alumni
has been the consequence of their ability to overcome the effects
of having gone to Freshman Camp. Recent proposals that
SEX Education be introduced to the format of that three-day
bacchanalia illustrate that the aspects of a nice, big prep school
shall remain with us always.

Not that SEX Education, per se, is a force of great evil,
but the memories conjured are ones of some of the greatest
flicks that were ever seen in eighth grade, such as “Where
Babies Come From,” and the classic “Social Disease.”’ Naive
as I was, I expected the flick to be about Jean-Jacques Rous-
seau.

However, the reaction of freshmen to such titillating ma-
terial is liable to be laughter. The majority of high school
graduates have been exposed repeatedly to the basics of sex
education, and I would submit that if they haven't at least a

One of the basic requirements of a
modern, efficient library is the pos-
| sion of a complete and useful micro-
film library with a large number of
available microfilm-viewing machines.
| Timesaving and convenient, a cabinet-
drawer full of microfilm can replace
a roomful of bound volumes of news-
papers. The questions which now
arise are: how much use is being
made of microfilm and microfilm ma-
chines in McCormick Library, and
are plans being made to increase the
amount and use of microfilm at Wash-
ington and Lee?

At the moment, the
possesses two machines for
film viewing. The machines which are
kept in the study room behind the
main stack level, are available from

matter of microfilms themselves, re-
cent editions of “Newsweek” are
available on film, as well as every
edition of the New York Times since

War Between the States.
Henry E. Coleman stated that an
agreement exists with the publishers
of both “Newsweek” and the Times
so that current issues of these publi-

put on microfilm. Thus, the library
has, and will continue to have, a
compact, up-to-date file on these two
periodicals.

Not Even Adequate

Although it is a start, Washington
and Lee's collection of microfilm can-
not be termed complete, or even ade-
quate. Mr. Coleman, for one, would
particularly like the gap between
1865 and 1930 for the
filled. While this project would cost
approximately $6,000, Mr. Coleman
feels that the money will in time be
made available.

Dr. James G. Leyburn, professor

of sociology, gave what he felt was
the faculty’s view of microfilm when

productive faculty, microfilm is prac-
tically required in facilitating study.”

be greatly aided by the enlargement

| Two basic problems involve, in Mr.

| space and equipment. The re-arrange-
| ment of the library must be effected
before complete resources of micro-
film and microfilm equipment can be
acquired. Shortly, however, the ground
floor of the library will be available
for expansion. Plans are being made
for the purchase of more machines
for viewing and for more microfilm to
view. Referring to these plans, Dr.
Moger stated: “Not only do we need

No Classes On Saturday:

Simple And

By LARRY HONIG

The University of Virginia’s recent
faculty action to abandon classes on
Saturday leaves Washington and Lee
as one of the dwindling number of
colleges which have a six-day school
week. Student opinion on this campus
again seems oriented toward desiring
the abolition of Saturday classes.

A referendum of the student body
took place in 1965, which showed
inconclusively (385-275) that students
did not wish to abolish Saturday
classes. I say “inconclusively,” be-
cause the overall editorial bent in both
campus papers as well as the word-
ing of the referendum ballot itself
was undeniably in favor of the status
quo,

At that time, the general impres-
sion was that no Saturday classes
necessarily meant afternoon classes
or very long classes or both. Here,
then, is a presentation of the argu-

ments for and against Saturday
classes, with an admittedly biased
discussion of the most logical and

appealing alternative. (This alterna-
tive plan is the idea of a faculty
member.)

Pro

Saturday classes present a problem
to almost everyone in almost every
respect. As one faculty member puts
it, “We're just like other men. We'd
like to have Saturday mornings to
sleep, to catch up on our homework,
to play golf, to spend time with the
kids.”

 

A referendum will take place
within the next few weeks on the
question of Saturday classes. The
wording will present a yes-no choice
along the lines of the proposal in
this article.

If a sufficient number of stu-
dents vote in favor of the alternate
proposal, this edition of the Ring-
tum Phi will submit the results to
the faculty for consideration.

 

 

The Making Of A R-t Phi; Or
The Fine Art Of Newspapering

One department head maintains that
the faculty would be overwhelmingly
in favor of not having Saturday
classes—provided:

@ Class periods are equal in length,

no longer than an hour each.

@ Each class meets the same num

ber of times.

In addition, certain segments of the
faculty, such as the science and physi
cal education departments, are op-
posed to afternoon classes.

Class periods of equal length, about
an hour, are necessary according to|
most faculty members with whom 1)
have talked, in order to assure that |
each professor has clases for the same |
amount of time (who could take an}
hour-and-and-a half quiz?). To maxi-

of them are work hours. There are
allotted somewhere between 10 and
12 working hours during which the
type for either edition of The Ring

tum Phi may be set. It follows, then,
that no more than 300 column-inches
of type can be set for a Ring-tum
Phi—and, because of headlines, cor

rections and so on, the total

is

“IT DROPPETA AS THE GENTLE

Logical Plan

mize student attention in lecture
courses, educators say that periods of
50 minutes to an hour are best.

Each class must meet the same
number of times, the antithesis rais-
ing the complex problem of “Which
class should meet how often?”

To students, having to go to school
on Saturday means less time to re-
cuperate on weekends, less time for
intensive studying (although the vali-
dity of this is doubtful), difficulty in
dating, and limited chances to say,
spend the weekend in Washington.

There are many, many alternative
plans to having Saturday classes. Ap-
parently, the most acceptable alterna-
tive—to both faculty and students—
is the following:

Increase class periods to 60 minutes,
with 5 minutes between classes (regu-
lated by bells). The day would begin
at 8:00; the last class would end at
1:20,

Presently, classes meet six times in
each two-week period for a total of
300 minutes. (While classes are nomi-
nally 55 minutes long, it works out

Swimmers Drown Loyola

The Generals rolled over the Loyola
swimming team, defeating them by a
66-38 margin. David Kympton led
the charge in the individual events
winning two, while Billy Ball, Bill
Brumback, and Ross Forman each
participated in the two winning relays
as well as winning one individual
event apiece.

Tonight at 7:30 the W&L swim-
mers host the University of West Vir-
ginia in the last home meet of the
year. The Generals have consistently
been able to defeat West Virginia in
the past, but this year is the first
year that West Virginia’s freshmen
are eligible so that this meet may
be one of the best of the year.

In the Loyola meet the natators
broke 10 existing records. Billy Ball
led of the 400 yard medley relay
by breaking both the pool and school
record in the 100 yard backstroke.
Ball’s time of 53.3 seconds helped
pace the relay which also broke a
pool and school record with a win
of Ball (backstroke), Costello (breast-
stroke), Brumback (butterfly), and
Forman (freestyle) combined for a
winning time of 3:37.9 seconds in
WA&L’'s 23% yard pool.

In the final relay, the 400 yard
freestyle relay team of Brumback,
Ball, Catlin, and Forman set a new
pool and school record with a win-

Tuesday, p.m.

ning time of 3:08.4 seconds. Brum-
back leading off, set a new pool and
school record for the 100 yard free-
style with the time of 46.3 seconds
breaking a record he held by sixth
tenths of a second.

David Kympton scored a first in
both the 1000 and the 500 yard free-
style events. Kympton’s time in the
43 length 1000 yard event of 11:53.4
seconds set a new school record; the
pool record being held by West Vir-
ginia Weselyan set last week. Chuck
Garten came in third in the 1000
while Dave Frankstone captured third
in the 500 yard event.

The records continued to fall as
freshman Hal Catlin broke his own
school record in the 200 yd. free-
style event with a winning time of
1:48.5; Jeff Grossman scored a third
in this event for the Generals, After
5 events Coach Stearns’ team was
ahead 30-13 and the outcome of the
meet was never in doubt. The Gen-
erals were up for Loyola, for the
Baltimore team had defeated them a
year before by a one point margin
47-48.

In the 50 yard freestyle sprint,
Brumback won a decisive first with a
winning time of 21.1 seconds. In the
200 yard individual medley, Ball cap-
tured a first and Bill Kimmel a third.

Ball Faced Facts

By RIC BERARD

Loyola of Baltimore, 66-38. While
Coach Stearns
might have eased
up late in the meet
against the Free
State squad, he and
the team were out
to show our Visi-
tors that last
year’s 48-47 loss in
Baltimore wasn't
for real. And, con-
sidering the margin
of victory, I be-
lieve the oppsition
was sufficiently impressed, particularly
since they were drawn and quartered
without the appearance of our No, |

who was out with a bad back.
Naturally, with records falling left

lcome. On Friday, Bill broke the
school and pool record for the back-
stroke in the 400 yard individual
medley and was the no. 2 man on
the record-breaking 400 yard free-
style relay.

To talk with Ball about swimming
is a wonderful experience. He epito-
mizes the accomplished athlete. With
the poise and confidence of a winner,
Bill exudes “class.” Although he cur-
rently holds four pool and school
records at W&L as a backstroker, he

| An injury-riddled W&L wrestling

m/ team was unable to provide much

two invading op-
ponents this past weekend, dropping

b | decisions, 30-8, to Loyola College Fri-
K| day night and 34-2 to Old Dominion

| College Saturday night. The losses
left the Generals with a 3-7 record,
| insuring a losing campaign.

| Against Loyola, W&L received five
| points for a forfeit picked up by 137-
| pounder Steve Simon and three points
for a 4-1 victory by 160-pounder Jay

Thieymeyer. Loyola score two pins,
five decisions and received a forfeit.

A shutout by O.D.C. was averted
| when heavyweight Dee Copenhaver,
| substituting for Waugh Crigler who
ihurt his shoulder against Loyola,
| wrestled a 1-1 draw for the Generals’
jonly two points. The Monarchs won
the other eight matches; four by de-
i cision, three by fall, and one by

Coach Dick Miller had little to say
about the losses. “We didn't wrestle
well against Loyola, and Old Domin-
ion is probably the best team in the
South, next to Maryland.”

The wrestlers conclude their dual
season this evening, meeting
U. Va. at Charlottesville. Last year,

Florida Trip Proves Unsuccessful;
Roundballers Return Home Tonight

The Generals’ basketball team
found the weather pleasant but the
Opposition very unpleasant on_ its
Florida trip last weekend, bowing to
West Florida College, 85-64, in Pen-
sacola Friday night, and to Florida
Presbyterian, 74-71, in St. Petersburg
Saturday evening.

Friday night’s class was a meeting
of two teams with identical 17-3 rec-
ords. In the game, the Argonauts of
West Florida proved that they are

 

worthy of their ranking among the

nation’s top twenty small college
teams.
W.F.C. used a tight man-to-man

defense which succeeded in holding
W&L’s “Big Three” of center Mike
Neer, and forwards Mel Cartwright
and Mal Wesselink to 26 points, 22
below their season average. Cartwright
and Wesselink had 9 apiece and Neer
8. Guards John Carrere and Nor-
wood Morrison led the Generals with
14 and 12 points respectively. The
Argonauts featured a well balanced
attack with five players in double

 

 

Player of

For the first time, one of
the Generals’ little men de-
serves recognition as the
Player of the Week. John
Carrere has turned in con-
sistently fine performances
all year and in the past
week’s games he has done
an outstanding job. Against
West Florida he led the Gen-
erals in scoring with 14 and
did a fine job of leading
the offense. Against Florida
Presbyterian John did a
“fine floor job” as the team
almost came back to win.
While Cartwright, Neer and
Wesselink have been gath-
ering most of the laurels
this year it has been the con-
sistent play of Carrere that
has been a major determin-
ing factor in the team’s suc-
cuess. John provides the out-
side scoring threat that is so
vital to taking the pressure
off the big men.

figures, paced by Bob Stinnett and
Doug Linville with 20 apiece.

The game was close until late in
the first half, when West Florida
scored six straight points, four by
Stinnett, to stretch a one point lead
to 30-23 with 1:32 left in the half.
W.F.C. led by nine, 39-29, at halftime,
and was not challeneged thereafter.

The Generals were hampered by
poor foul shooting, 10-22, and missed
opportunities due to mental errors.
Coach Verne Canfield summed up
the Generals’ performance by stating,
“We were bombed. We didn’t do any-
thing right.” He reserved his only
praise for guards Carrere and Morri-
son.

The Big Blue turned in a far better

performance Saturday night. After
Florida Presbyterian took a 57-45
halftime lead, the Generals rallied

behind an adjusted defense, falling
just short. W&L twice pulled within
one point durin gthe waning moments
of the game; 70-69 on a field goal
by Neer with 1:19 to go and 71-70

After the off games suffered the

General to hit double figures with

Big Blue in rebounds with 13 and 10.

Concerning his press duties in Wash-

Vietnam is an old subject for M.

to him that the French position in
Vietnam is not comparable to the

Billy Ball:

On Swimming

(Continued from page 3)

speaks not of himself but of swim-
ming and the team.

When I asked Billy about the fresh-
men on the team, the conversation
immediately centered on Bill Brum-
back. Hal Catlin and Mike Carrere.
According to Ball, “when you speak
in terms of greatness among swim-
mers, a guy either has it or he doesn’t.
Brumback has got it... but Catlin’s
pushing him.” And, with deference
to diving ace, Mike Carrere, and
the future of the team, Ball blurted:
“Oh, Mike’s really good right now.
Next year ought to be one of the
best teams W&L has ever seen, par-
ticularly if Coach Stearns can recruit
a couple of the boys he’s contacted.”

But more than Stearns’ recruting
| efforts have impressed Ball. In_ his
succinct manner, Billy finds his coach
“good,” knowledgeable, abreast of all
the latest techniques and a great guy,
which —coming from an athlete
familiar with Olympic coaching —
isn’t bad at all. And then, without
any prompting, Bill offered: “You
know, we're (the swimming team) just
like the basketball team. And so is
our coach.” Hmmmmm.,

Well, tonight is our last regular
meet. We face tough West Virginia
University which is now not only
subsidized but also using freshman on
their varsity team, While comparative
time indicate West Virginia will have
the edge, they are going to need a
great deal to beat out several Blue
swimmers. Among them is Ball. The
action starts at 7:30 p.m.

Whatever the outcome of tonight's
effort, however, Bill is pointing to the
CAC tournament which he flatly pre-
dicts “we'll win.” For although he
allows for last year’s champs, Se-
wanee, improving some, he sees WAL
a much stronger team. And with
guys like Willis Manville, Ill, on the
team, you gotta like our odds,

much, much earlier (the sports page,
for example, Ric, would have a dead-
line of at least 48 hours before publi-
cation). A reduction in advertising to
a non-existenent level,
would require a far-more-than-doubl-
ing of the students’ current contribu-
tion to this newspaper.

If the Ring-tum Phi were to print
SIX pages, Cosis—not counting type-
setting—would be exactly double the
cost of printing four pages. The in-
crease, logically, would not be worth-
while. We can expand our size—in-
crease text and reduce ads, avoid
“jumping” articles to the back page,
maintain reasonable deadlines—-and
not require three or four times as
much money from every student as
we do, Costs would increase far, far
beyond the proportion of size in-

creases.
Epilogue

Adevrtisers are, then, the lifeblood
of the Ring-tum Phi (may they ever
prosper). So are pictures (which do
not take away from Linotyping-time).

And finally, let it be pointed out
that no commercial newspaper in the
world devotes as little speace to ad-
vertising as does the Ring-tum Phi,
A 50-50 ratio, ads to news, is con-
sidered desirable by most; none de-
| viate more than 10 or 15 per cent
from that. The Ring-tum Phi's ratio
is 25-75, ads to news, and often con-
siderably less,

three times in one week, two times

that each class still meets 300 minutes

This plan would adhere to the fac-
ulty’s desire for equal-length periods
(all are 60 minutes) and equal num-
ber of meeting times (5 meetings per
clas sin every two weeks).

The benefit to students under this
plan is that they will be able to at-

points, 19 in the first half, and pulled
down 17 rebounds. He was ably
supported by Marvin Clemons, 18
points, Stone, 16, and John Criswell,
15.

Coach Canfield felt that his team
played a fine ball game, but again
suffered from mental errors. Twice
the Generals had foul shots nullified
when a player stepped into the lane
too early. Coach Canfield expressed
the opinion that Saturday's night's
game might have been a turning point
for W&L. “The whole team felt the
loss deeply. We were still suffering
from the effects of a 15 day layoff,
but should be ready for our tough-
est week of the year.” He went on to
point out that Presbyterian had a
fine team, owning a 103-79 victory
over Stetson, a team that was in-
vited to the NCAA small college
tournament last Spring.

The Generals, now with a 16-5
marks, face stiff competition this
week. Tonight, in the final home
game of the season, W&L will be
opposed by Emory & Henry. E&H
has back the same team that bested
the Generals in overtime last year.
In pre-game ceremonies, the Ring-tum
Phi will present its Palyer of the Year
award. Tomorrow night, the Gen-
erals will travel to Greenville, N. C.

Serious objections
from the faculty:

1) Having only two classes in one
of the weeks would be too small a
number of meetings to hold attention
until the next week. This seems a
valid point, although not wholly true.

2) Students’ weekend trips would
get out of hand. This argument is
considered quite seriously by some
faculty members; they cite a potential
rise in automobole accidents and a
diversion from school.

schools and nearly all co-ed schools—
will result in students’ being mentally

during the week.

And also, without
sound precocious, in
cvan be carried too far.

But the students have reservations,
too:

1) The day would be long. 8:00
is early, even though most colleges

1:25 is pretty late, meaning that
lunch would be half an hour later,
as would afternoon seminars and labs.

2) The somewhat-complicated week-
ly class meeting changes would be
easy to forget. I think, however, a
simple written schedule in notebooks
would suffice until routine facilitated
mastery.

The preceding arguments are limit-
ed, | admit, in that they are con-
cerned with only one proposal. But
the proposal is one which would
create a minimum of transitional
havoc and a maximum of faculty and
student benefit. The time for change—

tions—is _ overdue.

Future Plans of Graduates Affected

 

Draft Deferments Cut By New Rules

By NEIL KESSLER
News Editor

The future plans of most of the
students at Washington and Lee,
especially seniors, took an unexpect-
ed turn February 16 when new draft
rules were announced by the White
House.

Under the new rules,
ments are suspended, as a class
“critical occupations” list
pended. Draft boards will now judge
each defernment request on its indi-

job defer
The

is also sus-

vidual merit. Existing job deferments
will continue in force until they ex-
pire under past rules. This may mean
that not only students but also some
of our younger teachers may be call-
ed to serve.

No new deferments for graduate
students will be granted, except for
divinity students and youths study-
ing medicine, dentistry and allied
health specialties. A graduate student
not in these fields, who started his
work toward

degree last autumn, will lose his de-| House source as saying: “The draft's| U.

The annual Norris Pig Dinner will

Danner Lee Mahood, president of
the national fraternity, will speak at
the Norris Dinner. National fratern-

ity Executive Secretary Wililam S
Zerman and Section Chief James

Arthur will also attend the chapter's
celebration.

The first meeting of Phi Gamma
Delta at Washington and Lee was
held February 29, 1868, and, as most
fraternities of that day, it was a
literary society. Readings from Mil-
ton, Byron, Keats and Shakespeare
were discussed at the bi-weekly fra-
ternily meetings

Around the turn of the century the
fraternity changed into a social organi-
zation. Meetings were held in the
Masonic Hall until the purchase of
the chapter's first house in 1912. After
this dwelling was destroyed by fire in
1918, the chapter purchased its pres-
ent home at 112 Preston St

Famous alumni of the Washington
and Lee chapter of Phi Gamma Delta
include Newton D. Baker, 1892-94,
Secretary of War during World War
I, and Benjamin G. Flournoy, 1894

of the most handsome and impressive

What A Difference
50 Years Makes

Enormous herds of naked souls I saw,
lamenting till their eyes were burned of tears;
they seemed condemned by an unequal law . . .

The Inferno, Canto XIV, 13-18.

One wonders if they had the draft in Dante’s day. In any
case, his description is perfect for the scenes which were taking
place among male American college students both here and
probably at every other college in the country this week, when
it was announced that there will be no more draft deferments
for most graduate students and for a large number of persons
in formerly-exempt occupations (see article, page 1).

Actually, the status of most students here is unchanged;
for the past couple of years almost everyone has been aware
that, sooner or later, the draft would catch up with just about
everybody. But in the back of most students’ minds there was
always the thought that something—graduate school, an ex-

 

empted job, an unsuspected heart flutter—would intervene. |
Last week’s announcement, cutting away so many exemptions,
brought a good many people to the realization of just how close

the draft really is. And while that heart flutter may still descend
as a saving deus ex machina, somehow that provides rather cold
and spare comfort. We can’t pretend any more that the war
is a long way off.

It’s interesting to note that fifty years ago, in 1918, W&L
students were facing more or less the same sort of thing. It
was a very different kind of war then (it was easier to believe
that we were making the world safe for democracy), and, not
too surprisingly, the attitudes of the students back then were
quite a bit different. We were fighting “Huns” back then;
nothing so neutral-sounding as “V.C.” or as friendly as
“Charlie.”

The Calyx for 1918 devoted a whole section to Military

“When German duplicity and barbarity passed its men-
acing shadow over our fair land, no wonder that the campus
of Washington and Lee blazed anew with the old fire of
patriotism (of Generals Washington and Lee).

“On the 21st of last March . . . President Smith wrote |
our alumnus, Secretary of War Baker, that we wished to estab- |
lish military training at once. . . . Meanwhile, Dr. Pollard
(head of the P.E. Department) had worked out careful and |
detailed plans for the establishment of a base hospital, utiliz-_
ing for that purpose the Doremus Gymnasium, the Dining |
Hall, Lees Dormitory, the Field House, and Castle Hill Hotel, |
thus furnishing sufficient accomodation for 320 operative cases |
with nurses and attendants. :

“The Virginia Military Institute . . . placed at our dis-
posal the services of Major M. F. Edwards as commandant
with about sixty volunteer cadet officers as assistants. The
student body in mass meeting on April 6, accepted this offer
with enthusiasm, and within the week ninety-six per cent
of the whole student body were actively drilling every day
under this remarkable body of experienced officers.

“Our Ambulance Corps, when called to Allentown, Pa.,
soon won favorable comment and wide reputation. Many
vain offers were made to induce its members to accept officers’
positions in other units. The whole corps is now “over there”
ready for the spring drive, and all know that there is no finer
bunch of American college men in Europe.

“When the present session opened, the President took
as the subject of his opening address, “Our War-time Duties
as an Institution.” To a solemn and attentive student body
he urged that gravity, simplicity, economy, and loyalty consti-
tute the four-fold keynote of university life in these moment-
ous days.

“From an attendance of 531 last year and 381 last Sep-
tember, the enrollment at Washington and Lee has diminished
to about 330. At home and abroad, on land and sea, in every
training camp and aviation center, are to be found the repre-
sentatives of the present body and alumni of Washington and

i

Lee University.

“Full well the University knows that the thick strewn
stars on her service flag will soon be sprinkled with gold. Yet
with mingled pride and sorrow she knows that her sons in
life or in death will prove worthy of the traditions and his-

tory of their Alma Mater.”

important, CONTACT has a duty to
present to the students a program in
which the students have, at least, some |
interest, It seems to me to be patently
unfair to ask the vast majority of the
student body to financially support |

terest, at best, or in which, perhaps,
it has a decided disinterest. In this
respect it appears to me that the
CONTACT Chairman has the re-
sponsibility of assertaining where the
interest of the student body lies, and
upon arriving at his conclusion, he
should attempt to structure his pro-
gram accordingly, This is not to say,
however, that CONTACT is forever

By Stafford W. Keegin

A number of questions have been
raised concerning CONTACT, some
of a serious nature and others of
less consequence. I hope this letter |
will answer some of these questions
and, at least, explain the present
posture of CONTACT as, admittedly,
subjectively viewed by its Chairman.

First let me say that but for the
overwhelming contribution of the
Interfraternity Council there would
be no CONTACT. CONTACT is a
creation of the IFC and has been
under its wing ever since, as well it
should be. Ellis Zahra and the Judicial
Board whole, have shown a
continued and constructive interest in
the program. Any failure to give the
IFC the credit it rightly deserves is
mine. If there is any dowbt about
the value of the IFC to CONTACT
it should be dispelled. Almost 50%
of CONTACT operating funds comes
solely from the fraternities. If this
amount were half of what it is, there
would still be due from the student
body a hearty thanks. As it is, how
ever, the IFC this year made a con-
tribution of $2,500 which. by any
standard, is a real sacrifice and those

R. M. S, Titanic...

8 p.m. Wednesday.

Wednesday, permanent officers were
elected, committee reports read and
accepted, and a platform proposed.
The tide already seemed to be running
to Bryan, but Gov. Johnson's forces
managed to delay the proceedings
over adoption of the convention plat-
form.

Delegation caucuses met with Bryan
and Johnson leaders most of Thurs-
day. It was thought Gov. Johnson's
forces would try dilatory tactics
again at Thursday night’s session.

“But when the convention conven-
ed again,” said the R-t P, “the Bryan
men waged an aggressive fight and
spurred on by an overwhelming ma-
jority soon adopted a platform, and
the chairman, amid deafening ap-
plause, announced that nominations
were now in order.”

The names of Bryan, Johnson and
Carmack were placed in nomination.

As the balloting began, objections
were raised as to the conduct of
certain state delegations. The John-
son forces objected to the use of the
unit rule for delegation votes, where
all the delegation’s votes were cast for
one candidate.

 

 

“, .. four years to sink,”

But the Bryan forces had mustered
a majority, and the convention ruled
that delegations must cast votes by
unit rule.

The Johnson men claimed they
were not getting a square deal. “But
to this cry the Bryan men turned a
deaf ear and by their slow and gruel-
ing process lashed the Johnson men
into line,” reported the R-t P.

But as the roll call proceeded,
tension grew. The storm burst at the
calling of Kansas, when a fight broke
out among the delegates (“very char-
acteristic of that state indeed” quoth
the R-t P).

Similar fights broke out in the
delegations of New York, Pennsyl-
vania and Missouri.

But the balloting was completed,
and Convention Secretary W. M.
Johnson began tallying the votes.

Tempers were already high. Some
point was raised (now forever lost to
history). The convention chairman
ruled against the Johnson men, one
must suppose. But we must always
regret not knowing what that ruling
was in view of subsequent events,

G rading Criticized

| To the Editor:

As scholarship chairman of my fra-
ternity, which ranks third academi-
cally, | have been appalled to observe

the arbitrary grading policy of the

Fine Arts Department Chairman. For
some years he has apparently com-
puted student grade averages which
have borne no relationship to mathe-
matical reality.

Cases of the final exam dropping
a student's Fine Arts average from
a B to a D, or from a C to an F,
occur with alarming frequency; and
when the grade is questioned, it is
not unknown for the final exam to
disappear. In fact, at least one case
exists of a semester grade given
which was lower than amy grade
earned by the student at amy point
in the course:

Course:

Fine Arts 101

First hour quiz: K-
Second hour quiz: B+
Final exam: c
Semester grade: D

Although Dr. Junkin claimed not to
have liked the student's attitude, the
student involved, who cut the course
no more than three times, doubts
that the professor even knew him by
name fover 100 students were enroll-
ed in the course),

At least six additional students of
whom I have personal knowledge have
been similarly victimized: that is, their
semester averages were obvious perv-

i
ersions of the component grades. Who |

knows how many others this self-
styled Achilles has dragged around
the walls of Troy?

I have good reason to question this
professor's competence well as
his justice, and | hope that Dr.
Junkin will seriously consider whether

as

of the University for him to retire
at the end of the current semester

voluminous pages actually had some
newsworthy material in them. A-
typically, its readers were not subject
to the usual “stimulating” stories
about an egg-eating contest, the
Player of the Week Award, or a
“conventional” discussion of the dress
habits of the W&L student. Because
of CONTACT, its articles concerned
men and issues that shape our every-
day lives. Somehow I fail to appreciate
how this is in any way anti-intel-
lectual. And, for the editor of the
“Ring-tum Phi” (whose own paper and
editorials have hardly risen to the
substance of a “Little Audrey” comic
book) to object, seems to me to be
rather absurd.

Indeed, it is note-
worthy that the most stimulating
talk of the entire symposium, by
Robert Novak, was neither reported

in the paper nor covered by one of
its staff.

This is not to say, to be sure, that
Shakespearean Symposiums and the
like should be discouraged. However,
in & community where extra-curricu-
lar intelectual stimulus is somewhat
lacking, it seems dubious that any-
one should object to a program such
as CONTACT. When one is dying of
thirst in the desert, he does not reject
the waterhole for want of Scotch
and soda.

Generals Split

Pirates Shanghai Blue Bid
For Entry Into ‘Big Time’

Playing possibly their best game
of the season, Washington and Lee’s
basketball Generals completely over-
whelmed a hapless Emory and Henry
contingent Tuesday night. This year’s
Wasp team was the same as the one
which defeated the Blue last year
85-83 in overtime. A close grudge
game had been predicted, but from
the opening tap the game was never
in doubt. The final score read 110-65
and for most of the game the Gen-
erals were doubling E&H’s score.

Despite the lopsided score, both
teams fought hard throughout the
contest, and several times during the
first half fights threatened to break
out, as Mal Wesselink was bothered
by several of his frustrated E&H
counterparts. Perhaps the most signifi-
cant incident came late in the second
half when Dave Wolfe, the Wasps’
starting center was thrown out of the
game. After he deliberately fouled
Mike Neer, the referee awarded
Neer two shots. Enraged, Wolfe threw
the ball hitting the surprised referee
in the face. Mel Cartwright was then
awarded a technical shot.

From the start, the Generals dis-
played a fierce desire to avenge last
year’s loss. Inside the first minute
they had taken a 4-0 lead. From there
on the Big Blue proceeded to make
a farce out of the game. By 11:20
the score stood 23-8 and the Gen-
erals were threatening to
three-to-one advantage. Wesselink and

Mel Cartwright (voted Player of the
Year) were hitting beautifully, especi-
ally Wesselink who was hitting re-
peatedly from deep in the corner.
When the half closed the game was
all but over as W&L had seized a
49-24 lead.

The Generals didn’t let up during
the second half either. The Wasps
managed to close the gap to a tight
twenty points during the opening
minutes, largely due to their con-
tinued rought play. Time and time
again Neer and Wesselink were
smashed to the floor by the previ-
ously mentioned Dave Wolfe among
others, but the referees never seemed
to notice.

WAL started stretching its lead
again and with only seven minutes
left had a 33-point margin. It was
at this point that the fouls started
being called. At 5:40 Wolfe had his
run-in with the referee and spent
the rest of the game on the bench.
During the second half the Generals
took 23 foul shots.

It was at this point in the game

Bears Nip Colonels 85-77
In Tight Tourney Opener

 

Washington University’s Battling
Bears held off a second half up-
rising by the Prayin’ Colonels of
Centre College to take the first
game of the CAC Basketball Tour-
nament being held in Sewanee,
Tennesse. Centre came to within
three points of the Bears in the
second stanza, but the boys from
St. Louis, aided by some question-
able calls by the referees, man-
aged to hold on and came away
with an 85-77 victory.
| The win last night by Washing-
| ton U. gave them the right to meet
defending CAC champion Wash-
ington and Lee at seven o'clock
tonight. The nine o'clock contest
will feature host Sewanee and last
year’s Tournament runner-up,
Southwestern of Memphis.

Against the Generals, the Bears
will be ted by their fine guard,
5-9 Gary Sparks, voted Most Valu-
able Player in last year's Tourna-
ment, held in Lexington. The Bears
will also rely heavily on 6-7 Mark
Edwards to wrestle control of the
backboards from the Generals’
“M-Squad” of Mike (Neer), Mel
(Cartwright), and Mal (Wesselink).

The Washington U..W&L game
will be breadcast tonight on WLUR-

Wrestlers End Disappointing Season With Loss

air To Close Regular Season

Verne Canfield saw his chances for
back-to-back 20-win seasons for his
General roundballers crumble Wed-
nesday night as East Carloina’s Pirates
demolished the Big Blue 100-73 in
Greenville, North Carolina. The de-
feat left Washington and Lee with a
17-6 mark going into tonight’s CAC
Tournament semifinals, and, coupled
with the recent Florida trip losses,
virtually eliminated all chances of the
Big Blue receiving an at-large bid to
the NCAA College Division Tourna-
ment.

Coming off a stellar performance
against Emory and Henry, the Gen-
erals could not find the range against
the tall Pirates and managed only a
measely 38.6 per cent from the field,
a season low, In the meantime, ECC,
a Southern Conference member that
has been all but impressive in compil-
ing an 8-15 record this year, bombed
the nets at a 49.5 per cent clip.

Mel Cartwright and ECC’s Earl
Thompson each netted 18 points in
the first half, as the Generals kept
within 11 points of their major col-
lege foe. The second half, though, was
an entirely different story, as the
Pirates, with all five starters hitting
in double figures, exploded for 57
markers. East Carolina led by as

 

 

Under the watchful gazes of MIKE NEER, MEL CARTWRIGHT, Bob

for two of his twenty-nine points against Emory and Henry.

Season Ending
Third Triumph

A dedicated group of Washington
and Lee marksmen blasted their way
to a 1267-1249 victory over the
shapshooters of the University of
Richmond Tuesday in Richmond. The
win in the final dual meet of the
season for Sgt. Wesley Field’s gunners
upped their record to 3-4, the best
that a Washington and Lee riflle team
has posted since the 1963-64 squad
finished 4-6-1.

The victory on Tuesday was doubly
enjoyable for the riflemen, as it came
the day after a defat at the hands of
William and Mary 1231-1219 in Wil-
liamsburg, and it also avenged an
early defeat that Richmond had hand-

Sophomore Steve Unti led W&L
against Richmond, firing an excel-
lent score of 261 (out of a possible
300), which tied him with freshman
Mike Jenkins for the season high
single score. Jenkins had fired his
top total in an earlier match.

High marksman against William
and Mary was sophomore Hugh Guill,
who shot a 252.

Against Richmond, the match was
undecided until the last two positions
fired, with Washington and Lee’s Tom
Salb’s 250 providing the clincher.
Other scores in the match against the
Spiders were Jenkins with 256, Guill
with 253, and Chris Ruby with 247.

Coach Field expressed pleasure
over the outcome of the season, which
was a decided improvement over the
1-6 mark posted last year. “The team
is comprised of mostly sophomores
and freshmen, with one junior,” he

 

commented. “We should be strong

of Doremus pool he managed to cap-

After 11 events, the Generals were
ahead by one slim point, 49-48, and

(Continued from page 1)
Senate in 1966 in a sweep which car-

ried all but one county in South
Carolina.
Sen. Thurmond has served as a

teacher, county school superintendent,
city and county attorney. On the
state level, Sen. Thurmond has been
a state senator, circuit judge and was
governor from 1947 to 1951.

In the Senate, Thurmond serves on
the Commerce and Armed Services
committees.

On the commerce committee, he
is chairman of the surface transporta-
tion sub-committee.

He is a member of the Preparedness
Investigation Subcommittee, Stock-
piling of Strategic Materials and
NATO force status subcommittees of
the Armed Services Committee. He
is the second ranking minority mem-
ber of the Armed Services Commit-
tee.

During 1961 and 1962, Sen. Thur-
mond attacked the State Department
for what he described as a “no win"
foreign policy and the “muzziing” of
military officers. His attacks were
aimed at muzziing officers, troop
education programs and seminars for
reservists and the public on the Cold
War.

Sen. Thurmond attacked a mem-
orandum by Sen. J. William Fulbight
of Arkansas urging curtailment of
information on communism to the
military and public, Following this,
a special Senate subcommittee in-
vestigated military speech censorship
and cold war education activities.

New Rules Cut

Deferments

tion the number of their students who
will be 4-F.”

The White House source goes on
further to measure the draft odds for
men coming out of college with their
first degrees in June:

“We estimate there will be 500,000
students who will graduate this June.
Subtract the veterans, fathers, 4-F’s,
hardship cases and service volunteers
from this group, and that leaves us
with about 210,000 youths,

“We think that we probably will
have to take about 100,000-plus, of
these 210,000 men.” Thus, thousands
of grads who become 1-A may not
be drafted, unless there is a need
for more manpower.

rhose responsible for changing the
new draft rules felt that the students
who had been allowed four years’
deferment should share the burden

of the draft like those who were less
fortunate and could not go to college
because of scholastic ability or fi-
nancial reasons. This means that the
practice of drafting the oldest men
first within the 19-26 age group will
continue.

How wil Ithis change affect the
students at Washington and Lee? Will
the approximately 70 yer cent of
WAL students who go to graduate
schools be allowed to finish their
education before fulfilling their mili-
tary obligations to Uncle Sam? Only
time will provide the answers. How-
ever, one sure result will be that
applications to the law schol will
drop, as fewer and fewer students
will be able to continue their educa-
tion. Many returning veterans will
not be able to afford the expenses of
a private law school and will instead
go on to a state university, if, indeed,
they still have the urge to finish their
education.

Even second lieutenants com-
missioned through the Reserve
Officer's Training Corps (ROTC)
will find it tougher to postpone
active duty to attend graduate
school.

A new Army program, which
takes effect (it will not affect cadets
graduating this Spring or officers
already in graduated school), in
1969 will specify certain advanced
degree subjects for which active
duty deferments will be granted.
It will also establish a quota of de-
ferments to be given in each study
area. Previously, the Army fol-
lowed a liberal policy of granting
actice duty delays to almost any
ROTC graduate who pursued an
advance degree.

Those cadets planning gradute stud-
ies in other fields than medicine,
veterinary medicine, dentistry, osteo-
pathy and clergy, will be given a
limited number of deferments in each
subject for which the Army has
specified requirements. Applicants will
be considered on a competitive basis.

Answers Questions
On Annual Symposium

(Continued from page 2)

Mock Convention its existence in an
election year would be justified. Thus,
in order that there be a 1968 CON-
TACT, the symposium’s topic was
limited. | do not feel the choice was
erroneous. One merely has to look to
the size and fervent activities of the
campus Y.R.'s, the excitement gen-
erated by the Mock Convention, and
the amount of space the Republican
Party receives in the national press
to realize that topic was both of
interest on campus and timely in
nature. Unfortunately, however, CON-
TACT was unable to secure a segment
of the program consisting of some-
thing other than speakers. This dif-
ficulty may be traced to the fact
that politicians do very little other
than talk.

Last year and to some extent this
year CONTACT has received criti-
cism because it was either to liberal
or too conservative. Often I have been
asked why the program was not more
balanced. It is my feeling that CON-
TACT’s sole duty is to present its
study in as honest a manner as pos-
sible. It has no duty to balance the
program for the sake of merely keep-
ing one element or another of the
student body happy. If the subject of
CONTACT happens to include an
even balance of political philosophies,
the program will be balanced; if it
doesn't, then there should be no at-
tempt to balance it.

It has been suggested that CON-
TACT'’s invivation to other schools to
attend the symposium was at the
sacrifice of the interests of the stu-
dent body. It was my feeling that
it would be to the advantage of
CONTACT and Washington and Lee
to extend such invitations. The invita-
tions were extended after CONTACT
had received a number of inquiries
from various schools. To my knowl-
edge we had on campus at various
times during the symposium delega-
tions from American University,
Catholic University, Hampton Insti-
tute, Madison College, Mary Baldwin,
Swee Briar College, Mary Baldwin,
versity of Virginia. There may have
been more. It was the large delega-
tion from Sweet Briar that caused the
consternation, and | have written to-
day to ask that our invitation to
them be reciprocated for their sym-
posium.

In conclusion, | would like to say
that CONTACT to me has been one
of the most exciting evperiences I
have had in my educational life. It
is my sincere hope that the program
is here to stay, for it is, as I see it,
a contribution by WA&L’s fraternities
to the intellectual climate of the Uni-
versity, The broad based support the
program has received is proof enough
that the Interfraternity Council has |

invaluable service.

Senator Strom Thurmond
Talks On U. S. Challenge

Sen. Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina will visit Washington and
Lee Thursday, February 29. After a
banquet sponsored by the South Caro-
lina delegation to the Mock Conven-
tion, the senator will speak at 7 p.m.
in Lee Chapel. Sen. Thurmond’s
appearance is being sponsored by the
Young Republicans.

The title of the Senator’s speech
will be “Challenges to Freedom.”

Dinner Planned

the South Carolina delegation
dinner for Sen. Thurmond will be at
the Robert E. Lee Hotel at 5:30.
Over 200 tickets have already been
sold,

Sen. Thurmond will arrive at the
Roanoke airport about 2 p.m. After
his arrival in Lexington, a cocktail
party will be given for the Senator
at the PiIKA house.

Sen. Thurmond is a member of the
Republican party, although for many
years he was affiliated with the Demo-
cratic party. In 1964 the senator re-
nounced his Democratic membership
and became a member of the G.O.P.
in order to support Goldwater as the
Republican presidential candidate. In
the Democratic landslinde that fol-
lowed, Sen. Thurmond was never-the-
less overwhelmingly re-elected to the
Senate by South Carolina.

In 1948 Sen. Thurmond was the
States Rights Democratic candidate
for president. He carried four states
and received 39 electoral votes. The
senator has the distinction of de-
livering the longest speech in the
history of the U. S. Senate.

IFC Takes

Preliminary Vote

On Revoking Pledge Reform

Amid parliamentary confusion, the
IFC last night divided this year’s
new pledging rules into two parts
to defeat one and sustain the other.
Ralph Pearcy, Sigma Chi, reported on
the success of the Heart Fund drive
in Lexington, for which the IFC
canvassed the city. Steve Saunders,
SPE, spoke to the group about the
importance of a sober student body
during the upcoming Mock Conven-
tion,

Junior Justice Roddy Roediger,
Sigma Nu, made a motion last week
that the new pledging rules (those
adopted in May, 1967) be abandoned
for next year’s rush. Those rules now
State that there may be no required
pledge activities until after mid-
semester, and that any pledge with
less than a 1.5 at that time becomes
inactive. An inactive pledge who fails
to make a 1.5 at the semester is
depledged; any other pledge who
makes less than a 1.5 is then in-
active. Any inactive or depledged
pledge may become active once more
upon making a 1.5 at any subsequent
grading period,

Pledging Anytime

Roediger introduced a substitute
motion this week, which called only
for the repeal of the section of the
rule which does not allow pledging
activities before mid-semester. His
motion was carried in near-unanimity,
which means that fraternities may
have pledging activities at any time

Mr. Taylor's in literature |
has been long and varied, beginning
soon after World War Il. In 1948, he

the motion passes again next week.
A second motion was then intro-

rules having to do with grades, in-

motion received only ten votes, less

than the two-thirds necessary, so it
was not carried.
The IFC will meet next Monday

night, at which time the motion to
abolish the no-pledging rule must be

Heart Drive: “Success”

According to Lexington Heart Fund
Chairman Ralph Pearcy, the drive last
Sunday was a complete success, A
total of $809 was collected, an in-
crease of over 20 per cent from last

year.

Each fraternity was assigned a

 

specific neighborhood in Lexington
which it was to canvass for donations
to the Heart Fund. More money may
be coming in later, as cards were left
ai the doors of those families who
were not at home.

Saunders outlined the Mock Con-
vention agenda to note several times
at which meal hours would be dif-
ferent. The agenda will be published

later, but Saunders had two im-
portant points to make:

Attendance during the Saturday
morning session will be treated as
class attendance, since Saturday

classes have been called off by faculty
action. Of course, those who want
to cut may, but a cut will be recorded
for each of the student’s regularly
scheduled Saturday classes.

EC Debates Possible Split
Of Executive, Honor Roles

After enacting a measure of

fi-| of politics and more respected by the

nancial support for the Law Review | students as @ consequence, it was
last night, the EC turned to less press- argued.

ing matter in a consideration of the
advisability of splitting the EC into
separate legislative and judicial roles.

Gil Faulk proposed that 30 cents
per student of the student body head
tax be allocated to the Law Review.
The 30 cents would be merely a
re-allocation of the funds already
available in the Student Body Re-
Fund; the amount that each

The proposal passed unanimously.

EC Split
The discussion of splitting the EC
from a report given by Lee
Halford on a similar program dis-
cussed last year. The main reason for
the study was the difficulty that the
EC faced in allocating its time when
trials precluded legislative
activily

The proposed constitution would
change only the role of the EC as
the Honor System, which
would be administered by an elected
group of judges.

In the discussion of the measure,
the arguments in favor were that the
splitting of roles would separate the
powers and possibly make the en-
forcement of the Honor System more
effective. The separation would make
the Honor Sysiem more independent

The opening of more positions for
those running for office might stimu-
late others to run who might not at
present.

The arguments against the measure
were that no significant need has
been demonstrated and that a split
would tend to minimize the import-
ance of both sections. The argument
about allowing more students to run
for the office was disallowed because
of a shortage of candidates for even
the present offices in the last election.

WEL Battles To Conference Championship

If someone had asked Verne Can

have said “play tight defense,” or “get
the ball in to the big men,” but if
he had said that the tournament was
going to be won from the foul line,
most people would have thought he
was expecting his Generals to be the
victims of an upset, since WAL has

The championship; the referees

The Generals won a set of enormously impressive victories
since we last mentioned them in these columns (one week
ago today). The CAC bell was not got effortlessly. The con-
ference championship is all the more satisfying because nobody
can rationalize away our number-one status this year, unlike
last year when we won “only” because of the home-court ad-
vantage and/or a quirk (so they said). This weekend, we had
everything going against us that we had going for us last year.
But you can’t keep a good team down. To repeat an outrageous
but somehow-applicable tritism, “‘class tells.”

The Emory and Henry game a week ago tonight was a
magnificent exhibition of real team talent—a very, very good
closeout for the year’s home program. We said a few weeks
ago that we wanted to speak of the quality of the refereeing
at certain Generals’ home games—and then as now, we had in
mind Messrs. Swink and Bushkar (the two who tried to referee
in the E&H-W&L game). All season long, in every game
refereed by either or both of them, they dragged official re-
sponsibility in the gutter. But last Tuesday’s game was truly
more amazingly and patently misrefereed than probably any
other game in this state all year. Their blatant abdication of
professional integrity was notoriously, embarassingly obvious
last Tuesday. But—here is the beautiful part of it—they
couldn’t faze the Generals. Not a damn’s worth (and last
Tuesday, Swink’s and Bushkar’s refereeing wasn’t worth even
that). They couldn’t dent the Generals’ victory. When Swink
so misrefereed the RPI game—which we nevertheless won—
early in the season, we held off mentioning it only because we
were afraid of petty vindictiveness towards the team. We should
have hit him then, anyway—he couldn’t have become more
petty, nor more unfair, no matter what we said, than he and
Bushkar were last week; and even then the Generals proved
they could overcome it with room to spare anyhow.

Incidentally, we hope that none of what we say about the
basketball Generals is looked upon as taking credit away from
the swimming Generals, who also brought back a bell; nor
from the wrestling Generals, who also brought home a chunk
of the bacon; nor from the rifling Generals, who returned from
their tournament this weekend with one of the best records in
a long while.

The year’s first worthwhile proposal

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi endorses with enthusiasm Mr.
Roediger’s proposal—now before the Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil—that the group of senseless pledging restrictions passed
last year (for one purpose, which they utterly failed to serve)
be done away with.

Salt-in-our-open-wounds department

It’s depressing enough to find the Ring-tum Phi receiving an
almost-unlimited number of stupid, pointless publicity re-
leases — dozens of them, all the time — from just about
every agency and bureau in the entire federal government
(every last one of them, incidentally, sent under one frank or
another—i.e., at the public expense). The Peace Corps leads
them all: they seem to have three address plates for this one
newspaper, so we receive triplicates of every piece of trash
they crank out, the total being several score of inane releases
every week.

This weekend, though, the federal government's propa-
gandizing hit an all-time low, even for it; insult was com-
pounded by injury. Not only did we receive the usual number
of transcripts of Jack Vaughan’s many speeches to high

. '
schools and community colleges all across the country, but—

right on the heels of the LBJ/Hershey no-more-graduate-
school edict—we received a request that the Ring-tum Phi
promise to give free publicity to Secretary Wirtz’s latest cru-
sade, which is entitled “Continue Your Education.”

WLUR, the W&L FM radio sta-
tion, celebrates its first anniversary
today.

By RICHARD WATT

In only one year, WLUR has de-
veloped on all fronts into a progressive
and open-ended outlet of University
life. Broadcasting from 7 to 11 p.m.
Sunday through Friday, the station
serves up a variety of programming
that is of interest to the entire Lex-
ington community.

The station has developed as a
learning experience, a kind of labora-
tory, for the students involved who
are separated into three departments:
news, music and engineering.

Don Husat, the head of news, has
been instrumental in expanding the
“Home Edition” report to 35 minutes,
with a special “Insight” report and
weekly editorials. With several addi-
tions to the staff, the station has
been able to expand the sign-on re-
port at 7 and add a five-minute sign-
off news spot at 11. Journalism ma-
jors cooperate with the station to
provide the stories for the local news
section of “Home Edition,” an unique |

service of the station.

piled by W&L students, was a 9:30
p.m. feature of Lexington’s WREL
long before the University station was
even in the works. “Home Edition” is
now aired simultaneously over WLUR
and WREL. “Home Edition” itself is
a complete report of the day's events.
First are ten minutes of local news,
followed at 9:40 by news of interna-
tional importance. The last ten
minutes of the report are devoted to
a survey of the business and sports
news in the country and around the
world, The “Insight” report, recently
added to the program, is a five-minute
in-depth look at a major news story
of the day.
Programming Variety

Don Ellis, head of music on the
station, is as flexible in the variety
of his programming as the size and
proclivities of his staff will permit.
Since music is the main constituent
of the station's programming (usually
three of the four hours), the whole
gamut of musical genres has been
run, from classical and chamber
music to jazz and Broadway hits. With
the addition of Sunday evening air
time, the station has been able to
indulge in more profound studies of

such a deserved reaction in the mod-

 

ern history of the Washington and
Lee Concert Guild.

The world of music has been for
the past few years witnessing a major |
revival of interest in the styles of the |
Renaissance and Baroque periods. It
follows naturally that the recorder
and the harpsichord would be major |
focal points of the renewed interest.

Heinrich Issaac’s compositions be- |
gan the program. As Martha Bixler
explained to those present, these short!
pieces were written by almost all
composers of the period, and were
usually variations on the popular
melodies of the time, This Isaac group
was performed entirely on recorders
—Miss Bixler on alto, Leber on
tenor, and Newman moving from bass
to great bass as required. The quality
of the performance was unimpeach-
able,

Jacobean Fantasias

Four Jacobean Fantasias formed the
second group, While not as interesting
as the songs of the first group, these
fantasias represent perhaps the epi-
tome of the last 16th and early 17th
century style, As such, they were al
the very least of no little intellectual
interest.

Ending the first part of the pro-
gram was Johann Rosenmuller’s Trio
Sonata in G Minor for 2 recorders
and continuo, Leber noted that the
Flauto Dolce had seen fit to rewrite
this one a bit, making it a trio for
four recorders and continuo. They
were entirely successful in this ar-
rangement, with Miss Bixler and Mr
Newman switching madly between
movements, and in mid-movement,
from tenor to soprano back to tenor,
to soprano again, only to repeat the
cycle once more, finishing in a flourish

Scartatti Harpsichord

 

The second half of the program
began with four Scarlatti harpsichord
sonatas, The trio does not, unfortu-|
nately, bring along its own harps
chord, and the one which was im
ported for this concert did not effectiv

by the week-night features.

The technical end of the station is
run by Sandy Zimmerman. The engi-
neers, who are all licensed by the
FCC, are obliged not only to control
the nightly operation of the station,
but also engineer such specials as
away basketball and football games
(10 of which have been aired), and
rebroadcasts of the Contact speeches.
By taping the Nixon speech this Janu-
ary, and the Contact speeches of
Morton and Goldwater, the engineer-
ing crew were able to help several
radio stations (including the CBS net-
work) in their news coverage of the
events here.

The radio station is growing as
student and community interest grows.
Charles Winston, advisor to the sta-
tion, reflects the feelings of the student
participants, emphasizing that “the
station is a professional endeavor in
the community interest, but remains
a useful tool of the students’ imagina-
tion and ingenuity.”

With a staff of 55 which is con-
tinually growing, the station looks
forward to greater accomplishment
and diversity of service to the Lex-

 

ington area.

 

Saturday Class
Question Put To
Vote Monday

By LARRY HONIG

A referendum will be taken next
Monday, March 4, on the subject
of Saturday classes. There will be
three ballot boxes, one in front of
Washington Hall, one in front of the
Co-op, and one in the freshman quad.
All students and all faculty members
are invited to vote, from 8:15 until
3:00.

Last week's Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
carried an article which outlined a
plan to abandon Saturday classes. The
plan, devised by a faculty member,
consists of:

@ One-hour classes, five each day on
Monday through Friday, which begin
at 8 and end at 1:20 (there is a 5-
minute break between each class);

@ No afternoon classes, except for
labs and seminars as is presently the
case;

@ Five meetings of each class in every
two-week period (MWF the first week,
TTh the next week, then MWF, and
so On).

Briefly, the basic advantage to stu-
dents and faculty consists of having
a longer weekend for whatever pur-
pose the individual sees fit, including
facilitated dating, studying and relax-
ng

he disadvantages are a longer
school morning, longer classes (by
ten minutes), possible course discon-
tinuity when a particular class meets
every other week on two days only,
and what a member of the faculty
termed “abuse” of the longer week-
end by the students.

The ballot to be used in next Mon-

 

Ballot boxes will be open on Mon-
day from 8:15 to 3, at Washington
Hall, the Co-op, and the Quad.

 

day’s referendum will ask “Do you
favor the continuation of the present
schedule, with Saturday classes?”
There will follow a choice for those
who vote “No.”

The choice is either the plan out-
lined in this and last week's article,
or any plan to eliminate Saturday
classes, with the probability of after-
noon classes and the possibility of
90-minute periods. There will be space
for comments.

Everyone is urged to vote in the
referendum, even if he is not in
favor of abolishing Saturday classes.
If such a proposal is to be submitted
to the faculty as suggestion, partici-
pation must be high.

C.A.C. Bell Falls To Stearns’ Swimmers

W&L’'s swimming team led by Billy
Ball, Bill Brumback, and Dave Kymp-
ton marched to a solid victory in the
CAC championship. Both Ball and
Brumback were co-winners of the
Outstanding Swimmer award.

The final score was Washington and
Lee 164, Sewanee, the defending

 

Bill Brumback

champion, 118, and Washington Uni-
versity 116. Both of the Blue’s co-
captains Pat Costello and Noel Clin-
ard finished their swimming activities
by setting new conference records.
Friday afternoon saw the natators

capture a first, second, third, and
sixth in the 400 yard individual med-
ley which gave the Generals a 24—
12 (Sewanee)—8 (WU) point lead that
never vanished. They also won all
three of the relays and 9 of the 14
individual events to completely domi-
nate the event as the Generals were
able to capture at least a second in
every event,

Among the Generals who netted
firsts were Bill Brumback in the 100
yard frestyle, the 200 yard freestyle
and the 50 yard freestyle while
participating in two of the winning
relays. Ball won the 100 yard and
the 200 yard backstroke as well as
the 400 yard medley event, Ball, too,
participated in two winning relays.

Freshman Hal Catlin captured a
first in the 200 yard individual medley
and was in two of the winning relays.
Pat Costello handily won the 200
breastroke and was barely touched
out in the 100 yard breaststroke, Noel
Clinard staged a comeback recovering
from fourth place after 8 dives to win
a tightly fought diving contest of 11
dives. Freshman Mike Carrere falter-
ed in the final round of the diving
and captured a 4th place. A scant 20
points separated Carrere in fourth
from winner Clinard who won with
a point accumulation of 303.40 which
set a new conference record.

The three relay teams pulled off a
stunning triumph. All three of them
set new school records, two of them
set new CAC conference records, and
all three qualified to participate in the

 

 

 

Coaches Canfield and Stearns:

national college division champion-
ships.

The 400 yard freestyle relay team
of Forman, Kympton, Catlin, and
Brumback barely won due to the
typical high speed clutch performance
of Bill Brumback. The 800 yard free-

style relay won handily as it set a
new conference record. Forman, Ball,
Catlin, and Brumback captured this
event for the Generals. In the 400
medley relay, the last event of the
meet, again the Generals easily won

After a series of basket exchanges, the
Blue were finally able to open up
some semblance of a lead, as John

half gave them a five-point spread,
42-37.

Southwestern, though, fought back
with a scrappy defense that forced
three straight W&L turnovers, and

went ahead 44-42 at 10:41 on a pair
of free throws by Ken Brooks. Then

last two points coming on Wesselink’s
nifty turn-around underneath.
Following a Sewanee time-out at

Player Of

Last Tuesday night a
truly great basketball player
was awarded the Ring-tum
Phi’s first annual “Player of
the Year” plaque. M E L
CARTWRIGHT continu-
ally demonstrated the de-
sire, ability and attitude that
is so characteristic of great
athletes. Mel was a team
leader in every department.

Mel’s career at W&L is
half over now, and the Ring-
tum Phi staff sincerely hopes
that the next two years will
prove just as rewarding for
the basketball program. We
eagerly await next year’s sea-
son, when once again the
fine players of Washing-
ton and Lee’s basketball
team will take to the hard-
woods of Doremus Gym-
nasium: when once again
Mel Cartwright will delight
the crowd with his fine dis-
play of skills.

terfly), Costello (breaststroke), and
Forman (freestyle).

Besides capturing 12 firsts, the big
Blue rolled up 6 seconds, 1 third, 4
fourths, 4 fifths, and 5 sixth place
finishes. They established 12 new
school records for a 25 yard pool
and 7 new conference records, The
new conference records went to the
800 freestyle relay, the 400 yard
medley relay team (3:54.5), Ball in
the 100 yard backstroke (58.6) and
the 200 yard backstroke (2:11.9), Pat
Costello set records in the 100 yard
breaststroke (1:07.9 which was broken
later in the meet) and in the 200
yard breaststroke (2:27.5). The final
conference record was set by Noel
Clinard in the diving.

Second place winners for the Gen-
erals were Dave Kympton who cap-
tured seconds in the 500 freestyle, the
1650 yard freestyle, and the 100 yard
butterfly besides helping two relays
on to victory. Costello got a second
in the 100 breaststroke, and Scot Mc-
Elroy was able to net a second in the
200 yard butterfly and a third in the
400 yard individual medley. Bill
Kimmel rounded out the Generals’
scoring with a second in the 400 yard
individual medley.

The Generals came into the CAC
with the momentum of five straight
victories under their belt with a stun-
ning upset victory over West Virginia
University to spark their charge. The
only General defeats this year went
to Catholic University and American

Weekend Proves Fruitful

By RIC BERARD

This past weekend all of us had
cause to celebrate as Washington and
Lee completely dominated the three
C.A.C, tournaments, With both a first
basketball and swimming and a
second in wrestling, WAL swept the
conference's winter sports and set the
Stage for our winning the overall
trophy in May

bution to life at WAL this year, there

of the gratitude that we all feel

a great deal. And, even if the school

ely measure up to the demands
of the artist. In short, the physical
limitations o fthe instrument prohibit-
ed a complete exhibition of the per-
former's superb talent.

Scarlatti’s sonatas were followed by
the more interesting, and surprisingly
modern in its casual dissonance,
Sonata Ill (3) in F Major for bassoon
and continuo, of Johann Ernst Gal-
liard. Once more the harpsichord was
employed as a continuo.

Pieces of the 1960's

The final section of the program
scheduled three recorder pieces of the
1960's, The first, Miller's “Song for
Recorder,” was lyrical enough, but
seemed to have no reason or plan be-
hind it. It was mot strictly speaking
avant-garde, nor was it odd, but
neither did it capture much feeling,
despite the superb artistry of Miss
Bixler, The second of the truly mod-
ern works, clearly an experimental
design, was Linde’s Fantasien und
Scherzi for solo alto recorder. This
was avant-garde, and it was odd.

The final piece was Woollen’s
Sonatina for recorder trio. Woollen
did not stretch the powers of the
recorder; instead he wrote his piece
to conform enjoyably to the best
attributes of the instrument.

The concert was more than enjoy-
able, more than entertaining, more
than instructive. It was an experience.

Novelist Peter Taylor
Here Tomorrow

(Continued from page 1)

two other works by Mr. Taylor
“Happy Families Are All Alike’ and
“Miss Leonora When Last Seen, were
published in 1959 and 1963, re-
spectively. A playwright as well as
an author of novels and short stories,
Mr. Taylor wrote “Tennessee Day in|
St. Louis” in 1957.

During his career, Mr. Taylor has
gained a great deal of recognition for
his work. He received a Guggenheim
award in 1950; this was followed, in
1952, by a grant in literature from
the National Institute of Arts and
Letters. In 1955, Mr. Taylor was
awarded a Fulbright fellowship to
France. The Ford Foundation honored
him with a fellowship grant in 1960.

Mr. Taylor's activities have not been
confined to the U.Va, campus. A
1940 graduate of Kenyon College,
he served in the Army after his
graduation, Before going to Virginia,
Mr. Taylor taught at Kenyon € ollege,
his alma mater, as well as at North
Carolina, Indiana, Ohio State, Chi-
cago and Harvard.

Brown Physics Prof.
To Lecture

(Continued from page 1)
Arrangements for Prof. Masons
visit are being made by Prof. Edward
F. Turner Jr, chairman of W&L's
Department of Physics. Prof. Mason
is expected to give public lectures,
meet informally with students and
staff members, and consult on curri-
culum and research problems in
physics.

Mason was born in Atlantic City,
N. J. He received his B. S. degree
from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in
1947 and his Ph.D. degree from the
Massaschusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy in 1951.

Prof. Mason received the Scientific
Achievement Award of the Washing-
ton Academy of Sciences for 1962 in
the physical sciences, “for his many
outstanding contributions to the mole-
cular theory of gas properties.” i

Convention. He said that drinking on
campus and in the gym, of course,
is not allowed. But the biggest prob-
lem at previous conventions was
drinking in the city of Lexington.

Saunders has made a proposal to
the faculty that either there be al-
lowed more than nine combo parties
or that that number be open, to avoid
the situation where half or more of
the students feel they must get drunk.

Concerning the sincerity with which
the city and the faculty urge a de-
gree of sobriety—especially during
the parade—Saunders said that “all
anyone has to do is gross somebody

out at the parade and the Mock |

Convention will conclude its 60-year
history in 1968.”

NFU, PDT, and PKS begin the
bowling finals tonight. It looks like
Law has won handball, beating out
PKS, KS and PiP. Now down to
business.

Wednesday night PDT and SAE
met in the first game of the basket-
ball finals. PDT won, 40 to 32, after
a strong SAE finish. The high point
of the game came when Atkins of
SAE stuffed Johnson of PDT. Louie
P. could not believe it, so he blew the
whitle. It was the only thing SAE
could cherish from the game. PDT’s
zone clogged up the middle and
Hart’s accuracy from outside desert-
ed. Lee led SAE with 12 points and
Murphy led PDT with 9,

The next game was possibly the
| best basketball game to watch that
| has been played at W&L this year.

 

 

Intramural Wrap-Up

Cunningham converted eight of 13
free throws to lead PKS to a come-
from-behind, overtime victory over a
rattled NFU five. PKS won 59-56,
but Freret was high man with 23
points.

Thursday night put the winners and
losers against each other. PDT blew
PKS off the court by the score of
41-25. PDT’s Crampton pulled down
21 rebounds, just four short of PKS
total. He added 12 points to his effort
to lead all scorers for the night. The
sad PKS story was little rebounding
and a cold shooting night for Arm-
strong who had hit consistently the
night before to sink the NFU hopes.

NFU shocked a disorganized SAE
team in the second game 57-31. NFU
controlled the boards, outrebounding
SAE 34 to 18. Baker led all scores
with 16 for NFU while Lorman con-

 

trolled the boards with ten NFU
defensive rebounds. NFU won with
a pressing man-to-man defense and a
ragged, but effective fast break.
Bulletin

PDT takes title by defeating NFU
49 to 30. PKS came in second on a
52 to 42 score.

Washington and Lee’s novice deba-
tors won eleven awards Wednesday
afternoon at Roanoke College’s seven-
school, three-round novice debate
tournament held in Salem. Never be-
fore in the history of W&L have
Washington and Lee debaters won so
many trophies at the same tourna-
ment.

The four man team of Stacy East-
land, Joe Wich, Bill Radigan and

John McCardell won six of six de-
bates to win the tournament wihle
the W&L team of Kevin Baker,

Danny Leonard, Bill Payne and Ken
Walden won five of six debates to
come in in second place. This was
the first time ever that either Walden
or Leonard had been in a debate
either on the high school or the
college level.

Kevin Baker was chosen to top
negative speaker of the tournament,
as well as the top speaker of the
tournament. Stacy Eastland was the
top affirmative speaker in the tourna-
ment, while Bill Radigan was the
secon best negative speaker, and John
McCardell the third best negative
speaker. Joe Wich won an award as
the fourth best affirmative speaker.

Along with the eleven awards that
Washington and Lee won, the remain-
ing eight awards of the tournament
were divided among VMI, University
of Richmond and Bridgewater Col-
lege.

 

Will lie Prokofief “Eighth ‘ Sonata”

Thomas Brockman Schedules Recital

| Concert pianist Thomas Brockman,
well-known to Lexington audiences
from his past appearances here, will
perform the Prokofieff “Eighth So-
nata” as the major work in his re-
cital Wednesday night (March 6).

Brockman will be presented by the
Concert Guild at Lee Chapel. The
concert will begin at 8 p.m.

The program chosen by Brockman
is the same one which won him his
first big success in New York and
which he also played to critical ac-
claim on one of his European tours.

 

Although the Prokofieff sonata,
written during World War HI in Rus-
i, was introduced to the United

| Siates by Vladimir Horowitz, it was
| Brockman who gave it its first per-
| formances in such cities as Vienna,
Berlin, Munich, Amsterdam, Oslo,

Last weekend Andrew Wyndham
and Kevin Baker, both freshmen,
debating in the varsity division of the
Atlantic Coast Conference Debate
Tournament at College Park, Md.,
University of Maryland, won two of
three debates on the affirmative side
of the National Debate Topic to tie
with South Carolina and George
Washington University for second
place in the tournament. Over- all, the}

Wyndham-Baker team came in third
place with a 3-3 record.

At the same time, Tom Baremore
at the University of Pennsylvania
Tournament in Philadelphia tied for
fifth place speaker position out of a
field of over a 100 debaters. This
was remarkable considering that the
Washington and Lee team there lost
five of eight debates in this tour-
nament.

Geology Group
Expands Scope

A new student activity has estab-
lished itself on the Washington and
Lee campus in the form of the Geo-
logical Society. The group's primary
purpose is to allow students who are
interested in geology to discuss var-
ious topics which are not, as of now,
dealed with in class. Composed en
tirely of students who have had at
least three semesters of some form
of geology, the society numbers some
eleven members, the great majority
of whom are geology majors.

Most of the discussions and lec-
tures given are student initiated, with
students choosing certain topics either
relating to their theses or of partic
ular interest to them. As geology is
not a pure science, the discussions
often end up taking the form of
debates, in which the pros and cons
of certain theories are argued.

 

He also will meet with
and faculty members at a
afternoon physics seminar. During
his two-day stay he will meet in-
formally with the students and facul-
ty to discuss curriculum and research
problems in physics

Not Wise. Not Honest.

Back in December the EC voted 7-1 to reject membership
in the Virginia Association of Student Governments (VSAG),
on the grounds that the organization was too new and its aims
as yet undefined; that W&L would have little to say in guiding
its course; and that W&L has so little in common with other
Virginia schools that it would “no doubt gain very little” from

an association with them.

“At the present,”’ wrote EC President Richard Nash in an
article in this paper, ‘the disadvantages appear to far outweigh
the advantages of our joining the Virginia Association of Stu-
dent Governments. However, should the organization, at a
later date, prove to be of potential value and service to Wash-
ington and Lee, we will always have the option of joining then.”
Elsewhere in the same article, he had said, “It would not be
wise to ‘jump in’ without finding out more about the organiza-

tion.”

At the time, we remarked that we thought the EC had
acted in good faith in adopting a ‘‘wait-and-see” attitude. And
at the time, that may have been true. Executive Committee
members Steve Sandler and Danny Leonard had attended the
Fall Conference of VASG, presumably to find out whether
W&L could and should join. Mr. Sandler apparently came
away impressed, and cast the single vote in favor of joining.
Mr. Leonard, although he voted in the negative, suggested
that it wouldn’t hurt to wait and see how the organization de-

veloped.

All of that was well and good. But two weeks ago, on|_

Feb. 17 and 18, VASG held its Winter Conference at the Uni-
versity of Virginia. Sen. William B. Spong Jr. of Virginia was
the guest of honor; guest speakers included W&L’s own dean
of students, Edward C. Atwood, and administrators from
U.Va. and Virginia Tech. Our Executive Committee was in-
vited to send a delegate. No one went. At least one EC member
said he was unaware that there had even been a conference.
We suspect he was not the only one.

The EC is making a serious error. It should have been
apparent back in December that a significant number of
students feel that W&L can benefit from VASG. Whether
deliberately or from apathy, the EC is both arbitrarily ignor-
ing their interests and dishonoring its own promise to con-

tinue investigating.

Sending observers to the conference would have in no
way committed us to anything. Furthermore, it is significant
that of the two EC members who attended the first conference
in the fall, one came back completely in favor of membership,
and the other in favor of at least keeping an eye on the organi-
zation. Perhaps other EC members, if they had bothered to
attend the Winter Conference, could have come back with
similar conclusions—or at least been better able to judge the
organization from first-hand experience.

If, as Mr. Nash has written, “it would not be wise to ‘jump
in’ without finding out more about the organization,”’ it is
also true that it is neither wise nor honest to ignore the organi-
zation’s existence. It is not wise, because it is by no means cer-
tain that W&L would not benefit from membership in VASG.
It is not honest, because the EC is ignoring its promises to

keep an open mind.

Student Body Will Participate
In Mock Convention On May 3, 4

By BOB ENTZMINGER

While in the past months develop-
ments concerning the Mock Conven-
tion have been highly publicized and
its past claims to national recognition
exhumed and retold, most of the
activities surrounding this event have
been performed by a relatively small
number of students. The great ma-
jority of the student body has seen
only the results—i.c., speaker engage-
ments, delegation assignments, etc.

As convention time—May 3 and
4—neurs, the number of active par-
ticipants continue to grow until ulti-
mately the entire student body will
be asked to perform a role—mostly
as delegates to the
convention.

The focal point
of this spiralling
number of people
is, as everybody
knows by now,
Chairman Steve
Saunders. Around
him operates the
Secretariat, eleven
people who oversee
specific tasks nec-
essary to the suc-
cess of the convention,

Jim Lowe is the secretary, and he
handles most of the paper work.
Mike Miles is chairman of the fi-
nance committee, a major problem
at present. Part of this difficulty
should be alleviated by the Journal,
a collection of features in the midst
of huge quantities of expensive ads
(well, that’s the aim of Editor Ron
Kessler, at any rate), Kim Ladewig,
Siexe Meixner, and their committee
will have the unenviable task of

Saunders

 

renown is Ed Allen's specific job, As
director of publicity he has been work-
ing closely with John Hughes of In-
formation Services to assure Maximum
news coverage for each new occur-
rence. Val McWhorter, director of
protocol, is to keep the visiting digni-
taries as contented as possible and
relatively shielded from mobs, over-
ripe fruit, and such.

Tom Baremore, director of state
delegations, and his small staff are
responsible for seeing that the state
delegations behave as they ought,
which means that he collects monthly
reports concerning progress and di-
vision of duties within each delega-
tion from each state chairman, It is
he who must pressure the chairmen
so that they in turn will make de-
mands upon the individual delegates.
Basically each chairman is to de-
termine, along with the Secretariat,
whom his delegation’s counterpart in
Miami will support, To assure the ac
curacy in prediction for which the
WAL convention is noted, Staff Keegin
has been named chairman of the Re-
publican National Committee for the
Mock Convention. He has been main
taining a liaison between convention
heaquarters and the county chair
men. He is responsible for polling the
latter, and on that basis he will ad
vise the chairmen about voting. The
chairmen, at least on the first ballots,
will control the voting of their dele
gates.

The individual delegates will be al
lowed more freedom concerning the
proposed platform, which is being
composed by a committee of about
40 headed by Drew Colclough. In
addition to this nucleus, each delega
tion has a liaison to this committee,

Mock Convention History,

Part II

 

By PAT AREY
Mock Editor
“All of Asiatic Europe, as one man,
has risen up within the last few
years and demanded the rights of
local self-government, and this is
Democracy...”

“Today... we see the spectacle of
a divided Republican Party, caused
by the old ship of state striking not
an iceberg (It was the Year of the
Titanic) but the great rock of Gibral-
tar...” so chortled the first issue of
The Democrat.

It was 1912. The second W&L
Mock Convention again would name
the students’ Democratic candidate
for President.

Both of the national parties were
divided over potential nominees.

President William Howard Taft
was dismissed by the mock conven-
tion’s newspaper, The Democrat,
with the sentence “Nobody loves a
fat man.” Theodore Roosevelt was

addressed as such: “Hail to the Chief.
Chiefest of his own ambition and
estimation... A vulture feeding on
the carron of open notoriety and cal-
lous abuse...”

Leading Democrats included Wood-
row (The Collegian’s Candidate) Wil-
son, Governor of New Jersey; Champ
(“the Democratic Party has more
lives than all
Island”) Clark, Speaker of the House
of Representatives; Judson (“he is
too conservative and is almost re-

actionary”) Harmon, Governor of
Ohio; and Oscar Underwood of
Alabama.

Said one Wilson supporter, “This
is an age when it is a joy to live,
and be a Democrat.”

After some question as to if there
would even be a mock convention,
sponsorship was undertaken by The
Forum, WA&L’s newly formed civic
club. The convention was called for
Tuesday, May 14.

Preconvention Maneuvers

Gov. Wilson and Speaker Clark
were the leading candidates. Clubs
had formed supporting all the Dem-
ocratic candidates and competition
was high.

Great debates raged in the Cre-
dentials committee over delegations,
Fraud was alleged in the Missouri
delegation, Clark's home state. It
seems, reported the Democrat, that
the delegation chairman called a
Clandestine meeting of Clark sup-
porters, had himself elected perman-

The chairman ruled them invalid
He had the votes; the Wilson men
were casi oul, so to speak, and the
chairman was last reported disappear-
ing ‘down the road,’

 

Motion To Adjourn

Most notable of the first session
on Tuesday was the entrance of the
Kentucky delegation. The perman-
hent convention chairman was speak
ing. “The Kentucky delegation enter
ed the hall with a large banner on
which was pictured Champ Clark and
the things for which the State is
justly famous.”

The chairman was also given the
power to fine any delegate a wim)
not to exceed one dollar for any/|
“undue disorder.”

The platform was adopted, calling
for, among other things, election of

ing campaign expenses, adoption of
a parcel post, anda graduated income
tax.

Nominations were now in order.

A second motion for adjourn-
ment was made, and ignored.

“And in the noise that rocked the
whole chapel and was heard far
over the campus, Col. Dow went
back to his seat...” One over-zeal-
ous New Jersey follower led “nine

The Clark men, not to be counted
out: “the huge form of P. C. Rogers

finished with 311 votes for Wilson,
227 for Clark. Under the rules, 2/3
of the votes were needed to nominate.

As the second call began, Alabama

and Tennessee seconded. In the New

revolts spring up, but the chairmen
held their delegations in line for
Wilson and Clark. The second bal-
lot finished with Wilson, 327; Clark,
184; Underwood, 32.

At the fourth session that night,
the chairman pointed out to the
delegates that the convention must
elect a nominee as the faculty had
allowed only one day without classes
for the convention.

Few changes came on the third
ballot: Wilson, 318, Clark 199; Un-
derwood, 29.

A trend seemed to start for Clark
on the fourth ballot with 225 votes
for Clark; Wilson down to 202, and
Underwood handging on to his 29,

Clark men,

The convention plodded into a
fifth ballot. No surprises seemed
coming, even when Nebraska nomi-
nated Gov. Harmon. The switch came
when New York went over to Har-
mon with 45 votes. Pennsylvania fol-
lowed, then Virginia. Vermont tried
to shift the convention to Mayor
Gaynor of New York City, but no
chance.

Tennessee then moved to change
its votes to Harmon, and it was all
over. With many delegations recast-
ing their votes, Harmon won with
375 of 546 votes.

In the closing moments, the vice

| presidential candidate was nominated.

Sen. Robert L. Owen of Oklahoma
(a W&L Alumnus) won over Oscar
Underwood of Alabama, Foss of
Massachusetts, and John W. Davis
of West Virginia (who would carry
the convention another day).

The motion to adjourn was made

 

as delegates left the hall.

 

Faculty Voices
Its Approval
Of Pass-Fail

By BERNIE FELD

The latest innovation to the cur-
riculum, the “pass-fail” system, after
one semester of Operation has re-
ceived the overwhelming appoval of
the faculty.

Under “pass-fail” a junior or sen-
ior may take one free elective a se-
mester without receiving a letter
grade and still receive credit for
the course provided he passes it. The
system, which is in use in a num-
ber of colleges throughout the coun-
try, was proposed by the Executive
Committee and was approved by the
faculty in the spring of last year.

Last Semester 54 students took
courses pass-fail. Judging from the
reactions of a number of faculty
members in various departments
questioned this week, the new pro-
gram seems to be a success,

The main objective of the program
was to encourage students to branch
out and take courses which they have
been afraid to take under normal
circumstances.

As English professor Robert Hunt-
ley said, “Most of those who took it
in my class did not want to compete
with English majors.”

He said the program is “getting
you back to the idea of a liberal
arts college. Nobody wants to ex-
pose himself today, they tend to stay
in their own narrow fields. Now this
brings a lot of guys out of the weeds.”

One of the major fears of the pro-
gram was that students would take
advantage of it not to work hard,
however, this does not seem to have
been justified.

Professors found that most stu-
dents would have made A’s or B's
had they taken the course for grades.
There were a few instances in which
pass-fail students made F’s, but this
was the exception.

Only one professor expressed dis-
appointment with the system.

“I'm in favor of the effort to take
pressure off grades,” he said, “but
I'm not sure this is the way to do it.”

He called the program nothing
more than “a faint effort to tinker
with the system.”

At any event, the program is be-
coming entrenched in the W&L cur-
riculum, This semester 88 students
are taking courses pass-fail, more
than a sixty per cent increase over
last semester.

This statement was made by Com-

of the National Front for the Libera-

ample. The most important article
begins on page 4: “TOWARD A

LUTION’S STATURE.” The author
takes a frank, open look at the goals
of the socialist organ—and the pos-
sible pitfalls awating it.

Not the least of these pitfalls is
the conspiracy inevitably directed
against the publication of Truth in
the imperialist countries, As the
author so rightly observes:

enemies try to give a dis.
torted meaning to what we do or
not publish, or to the form
which we publish something.

(He adds elsewhere, “Sometimes
we believe that it is enough to use a
‘political slogan’ with exaltation, or
just repeat that “The Imperialists are
bad, and the revolutionaries are good,’
until it becomes tiresome. In many
cases nothing could be less political,
so false and unproductive as the use
of the so-called ‘Political slogan’.”)

In short, we need “a profoundly

The revoluntionary press can even
use the imperialists’ Own newspapers
and books against them, explains the
writer—Truman Capote’s In Cold

“This sordid story of crime and
violence, taken straight from real life,
is a faithful portrait of the inner
workings of imperialist society .. .
This work and others of its kind

As Head Lacrosse Coach

By STUART PORTER
With 56 boys turned out so far,
15 of whom are returning lettermen,
lacrosse Dick Szlasa is very
optimistic about his first season at
Washington and Lee, and hopes to
better last year’s 4-5 record.

Unofficial practice began on Febru-
ary 4; attendance was not complsory,
but Coach Szlasa was very pleased
the turnout. Practice officially
starts Monday on Alumni Field.

Coach Szlasa is being assisted this
season by three law students—Carroll
Klingerhoffer, who will handle the
B team; Butch West, who will work

By ROY CARLTON

Amid mass confusion, wild cos-
tumes and cars of every description,
Washington and Lee’s first automo-
bile rally will begin at 2:45 tomor-
row afternoon. Messrs. Roger Clarke
and Bob Gastrock have been work-
ing hard for several weeks to shape
an event that could very well be-
come a spring rite on the level of
Goshen or Natural Bridge. Should
this initial rally meet with a good
response, another one will be plan-
ned for sometime in March with
several more to follow after Spring
Vacation.

Because of the time and record-
breaking difficulties, this first rally
will be limited to some fifty cars.
Positions for the start will be award-
ed on a first-come-first served basis.
However, if there are a_ significant
number of cars above the limit, a
second rally will be held tomorrow

 

The material Coach Szlasa has to
work with is abundant and experienc-
ed. Returning lettermen include goalie
Dave Johnson; Midfielders Terry
Griffin, Bart Goodwin, Ralph Schen-
kel, Clark Carter, Hugh Baugher and
Jay Merriwether; defensemen Charlie

 

Stewart, Harold Stowe, Ned Coslet,
and Holmes Raker; and attackmen,
Chip Chew, Jim Chance, Tom Pitt-
man, and Joe Wich.

In addition to all the returning
varsity lettermen, Szlasa is optimistic |
about the chances of 8 returning B
team members; John Miller, Stan|
Lilse, Tom Mullenix, Ben Schwarts, |
Landon Quinn, Howard Capito
John Thomas, and Dick Capron.

There are four outstanding fresh-
men prospect out, also. They include
Bill Brumback, Frank Brooks, Jay
Knupp, and Whit Morrill. Other
strong freshmen are Bill Ingersol,
goalie, who did a fine job in the box
lacrosse game against U.Va. a few
weeks ago; Bob Radcliffe, Bill Bal-

Coach Szlasa

lard, and Rocky Kimball. Bob Frost
and Tom Groton, both ineligible last
year, are also potential starters.

The team will have five unscored, |
controlled scrimmages before its open

 

| ing game, which will be away against |

Hofstra on March 19, These will in
clude back-to-back home games with
Adelphi and Ohio State and a pair
of Lexington with Yale. |
Dartmouth will come in for a scrim
mage on March 25

After the Hofstra game, the team
travels to Loyola of Baltimore. The |

As the two post-season basketball
tourneys continue their bidding for
participants, the sports fan can see
a definite disparity between the teams
chosen for the NCAA tourney and
selected for New York’s NIT.

Conference champs among major
college designated teams automiatical-
ly get a bid from the NCAA of-
ficials, who will then fill out their
field with at-large picks. The Nation-
al Invitational Tournament, _ then,
loses some of the powers that might |
produce a more exciting match-up.
It is left with the independents, and
often, not even the high ranking free-
lancers, such as Houston's Cougers.

Last year’s NIT showed this graph-
ically. Of the four semi-final teams,

standing, while the other three had
made only brief flirtations with any
sort of national prominence. Al-
though the tournament produced some
fine basketball and outstanding per-
formances of such stars as Walter
Frazier, Bob Lloyd and George Stone,
many factors kept it from being a
“national” tourney able to compete
with the NCAA.

One is the predominance of north-
eastern based teams found in the
NIT; this naturally produces fan sup
port for the tournament. However,
when southern, midwestern, or west-
eran teams come to New York to
display their wares, their victories
become rather meaningless if gained
at the expense of easter independ-
ents with 19-9 records.

Independents’ Plight

tival does land are usually only run-
ners-up.. The big boys are all entered

sistant Rallymaster Gastrock. Both he
and Rallymaster Clarke expect to
see a number of drivers wearing gog-
gles and scarfs or whatever they
can find. Gastrock continue to say
that “We're not limiting the number
of people per car...we're hoping
that any advantage that drivers may
have in extra passengers will be offset
by the added confusion.”

because most independents can’t hope
to secure the rugged regular season
schedules that would hone them for
the March tourneys.,

Now, to take the previous state-
ments and make the iron-clad declara-
ration that no independent belongs on
the same court with, say, a Big Sky
Conference champ is only a little
short of ludicrous. Loyola of Chi-
cago’s victory over Cincinnati a few
years back and Houston’s strong posi-
tion, not to mention St. Bonaventure,
this year speak well for the individual
independent team once and a while.

be a race. In fact, recommended
speeds will be suggested well below
the speed limits of the roads. Also
larger penalties will be given to those
arriving at check-points early than to
those coming in late.

The rally will be conducted ac-
cording to three variables: time,
speed, and milage. Before beginning,
each car will be given instructions.
The route will not be given, just
two variables from which the navi-
gator must direct the driver. For
instance, the directions might read,
“travel three miles at thirty miles
per hour and turn right at the red
barn.” From these instructions the
driver must figure where to turn
and be careful to arrive on time.

and he will be called in for hearings
on proposed planks when issues be-
gin to crystallize. The only restriction
on individual freedom here is the
requirement that each delegate vote
as he feels his counterpart will do in
Miami.

In addition to this scholarly prepara-
tion, the delegations must also pro-
vide for the color and revelry of a
real convention. The arrival of beauty
queens and dignitaries and favorite
con campaigns, as well as decorating
a headquarters (or at least hanging out
an apparent sign), will play a large
part, but the parade is to be the
most elaborate element in the super-
ficial trappings. Parade Director Bob
McLaughlin has been working with
a float director from each of the 53
delegations—the states, Puerto Rico,

 

the Virgin Islands, and the District
of Columbia—to assure a minimum |
of problems. For instance, in 1964}
nine floats were left half completed |
as the parade began. |

Much of this is expensive, and the |
chairmen must rely heavily upon their |
delegations not only for the man-|
power to build floats and OCCUPY |
headquarters, but for sources of reve- |
nue. Moreover, each state has been
assigned an advertising quota for the}

ing today’s NIT to be a true “invi- |
tational,” since all other teams would
be free for the picking. This would
allow the New York group to get|
whatever good conference second, or |
even third place finishers, in addi- |
tion to all the good independents. |

Then, rather than proclaiming an)
NCAA and NIT winner, why not a|
super-game pitting the victors? This |
would seem to solve more than)
one problem. The tournaments would
be of more even strength, and the
chances of more Loyolas enhanced.

IFC Approves
Pledge Reform

Pledging may be begin at any time
next fall, the IFC voted last night.
This reform of last spring’s rush rules
passed for the second vote with the

needed two-thirds majority, which
means it is now a_ constitutional
amendment.

Sigma Nu law student Bill Schildt
presented the fraternities a report
made to the Student Affairs Com-

mittee by a subcommittee consisting
of himself, IFC President Ellis Zahra,
and Dean of Students E. C. Atwood
Jr.

“Positive Support”

In the form of a three-page set of
“guidelines,” the subcommittee out-
lined what it hoped would be helpful
suggestions for the fraternities to be-
come more integral parts of the Uni-
versity community.

The recommendations concerned
physical facilities, membership, schol-
arship, social activites, and advisors.
Evaluation on a regular basis was
urged,

Ball System

In the section dealing with mem-
bership, a clause which Schildt said
“simply suggests that the system
should be examined” reads “Each
chapter should examine its one or
two ball bid system with a view to
making admission to fraternities less
restrictive.”

having attained the highest cumulative
grade-point average in the senior
class—3.789. In doing so, Dunn re-
ceived A’s in 95 hours of courses,
B's in 16 hours and C in four hours.

BROCKMAN

Concert Pianist
To Play Piece
By Prokofieff

Thomas Brockman, distinguished
concert pianist, will perform tomor-
row night in Lee Chapel.

The concert will begin at 8 p.m.
and is being sponsored by the Con- |
cert Guild.

The highlight of his performance
will be Prokofieff’s “Eigthth Sonata,”
which Brockman himself introduced
to many European cities for the first
time.

The program that has been chosen
by Brockman for his performance at
Washington and Lee is identical to
that which he gave in New York and
on one of his European tours.

Although the Prokofieff sonata,
written during World War Il in Rus-
sia, was introduced to the United
States by Vladimir Horowitz, it was
Brockman who gave it its first per-
formances in such cities as Vienna,
Berlin, Munich, Amsterdam, Oslo,
Copenhagen and Stockholm in addi-
tion to England's “Third Programme”

Of Executive,

The EC last night voted against the
proposed split of the EC into two
committees with separate executive
and judicial functions, The vote was
10-1 iwth Jody Kline the only mem-
ber not voting with the majority.

The rest of the night was spent in
hearing reports from the various stu-
dent body committees.

 

Curriculum Committee

Lane Steinger submited a written
report from the Curriculum Commit-
tee, which stated that work was con-
tinuing on the pilot study and evalua-
tion of the Political Science Depart-
ment. He also said that the committee
had become involved in other studies,
including some consideration of the

EC Rejects Proposed Split

Honor Roles

Steve Saunders reported on the
progress that the Mock Convention
had made for the May convention.
The lack of general student interest
would hopefully decrease as time for
the convention approached, accord-
ing to Saunders. The crucial problem
of student behavior was considered,
and the EC decided to talk to the
Student Control Committee about
possible ways to enforce its rules
during the convention.

Saunders said that the convention
had begun to recruit students to serve
as sargents-at-arms during the con-
vention. He hoped that these students
would be given the power to report
students to the Student Control Com-
mittee and that Student Control be
given the power to fine in addition
to placing potentially rowdy students
on conduct or social probation.

23 Named To Phi Beta Kappa;
Convocation Planned For April

William McClure Schildt, Hagerstown,
Maryland and Bobby Wayne Tucker,
Long Island, Virginia.

Phi Beta Kappa was founded at
William and Mary in 1776, It has
since become a national honorary fra-
ternity for scholastic achievement. The
criterion for the selection of mem-
bers is based on overall academic
achievement and moral character.

The Phi Beta Kappa—Society of
the Cincinnati Convocation is planned
for April 18. A speaker has not yet
been selected. The initiation and a
formal banquet are being planned for
later in the day.

Saturday Study
Group Named

At its regular monthly meeting on
March 4, the faculty voted that an
appropriate committee be named by
President Huntley to study proposals
for a five-day week. According to
Dean W. W. Pusey the committee is
expected to be named “shortly.”

The committee is to submit to the
faculty for vote no later than its
regular October 1968 meeting a plan
for a five-day week. Such a plan will
entail amendments of the rules and
regulations of the faculty as will
effectuate a schedule of classes for a
five-day week.

Plan Proposed
Included in the plans to be con-
sidered is one for all classes and

laboratories to be held between 8:00
am. and 4:00 p.m., on the days of
the week Monday through Friday. By
this plan assemblies, lectures, home
athletic contests, and extra-curricular
activities should be scheduled at times
other than those set aside for regular
class and laboratory meetings.

Others Considered

According to Dean Pusey, the com-
mittee would also consider other plans
submitted for a five-day week. For
the results of yesterday's poll con-
ducted by the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
in regard to Saturday classes, see the

A small disagreement

We wonder whence originates the passion for joining the Vir-
ginia Association of Student Governments—or, frankly, for
even spending much time and effort in keeping a continual
watch on its development.

The fact that both Dean Atwood and Junior Senator
Spong addressed the recent VASG meeting leads to no con-
clusion at all. Dean Atwood spoke, moreover, in his capacity
as president of the Virginia Association of Student Personnel
Administrators, not as ““W&L’s own dean of students” per se.
If Robert E. Lee himself rose up to speak to the VASG, that
would in no way indicate that the group would be one whit
more careful with what it attached W&L’s name to. And that
has been our argument all along. Washington and Lee Uni-
versity would possess two per cent of the vote in the VASG
(being the exact equivalent of the vote of, say, John Tyler
Community College). The other 98 per cent would be free
to do with our name what it wanted.

Of course nobody can “prove” that VASG membership
would hurt W&L. But with our name appearing on its letter-
head and with no veto over what goes below, the possibility
is there. Let’s face it: Washington and Lee does not have a
great deal in common with a good many other colleges in
Virginia—not, at least, to the point where we could always
feel comfortable being a minority of two per cent among
them. Call it snobbishness if you will (we prefer “‘pride’) :
but we have, in our name, something to protect that a lot of
schools simply don’t. The VASG knows so. That’s why the
group has been inundating the Executive Committee with
wild-eyed propositions, invitations and the like without num-
ber. (To say the EC is “arbitrarily ignoring” the VASG is
erroneous. Even if it wanted to, it couldn’t. The VASG won't
let it.)

We don’t intend this to imply absolute closemindedness
against the VASG. But we can’t agree that the EC’s posture
in this matter is “not wise . . . not honest.’”” The VASG must
come to us, not us to them. And the VASG must guarantee,
not just reasonably assure, us that our school’s prestige and
name will be used judiciously—from our point of view, not
theirs.

The chimes of Lexington’s Trinity Methodist Church are
perhaps of a quieter nature than those at Cambridge, but the
problems of life at W&L are further compounded by bells for
Washington’s Birthday, bells for Lee’s Birthday, bells for
classes, bells for deceased faculty members, etc.

The cacaphony is further heightened by noon whistles, fire
sirens, and, on Sunday mornings, a number of bells that ring
for no apparent reason as if they thought to get students to
church by mere persistency.

Twelve o’clock noon is a dangerous time to live in Lex-
ington. But the worst part is that the bells are never right. The
noon whistle (which used to indicate noon in more stable eras)
now rings at 11:58.

The only remedy is to wear ear plugs or join Quasimodo

Five-Day Week?----Resounding “Yes!”

By LARRY HONIG

The largest turnout for any ballot-
ing in W&L history voted an over-
whelming “no” to Saturday classes.
Eighty per cent of the student body
cast votes—1168 out of 1461 en-
rolled—and 84 per cent of these
were in favor of eliminating Saturday
classes (67 per cent of the total num-
ber of students.)

Of the 80 per cent, 73 per cent
(988) favored adoption of the plan
proposed by a faculty member, as
outlined in the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi. Eight per cent opted for after-
noon classes.

Briefly, the plan consists of no
afternoon classes except labs and
seminars. The school day begins at
8, ends at 1:20; classes are 1 hour
long (there is a 5-minute break be-
tween classes), meeting alternate
weeks on MWF, then TTh.

Educational Aspect

In further criticism of the plan,
one high administrative official point-
ed out—correctly—that there is no
educational benefit to be derived from
the change, and that there are many
associated problems not mentioned
previously,

These difficulties have to do with
jaboratory courses, whose continuity
would be disturbed, various non-3-
hour-courses (Computer Program-
ming, etc.), possible increased frater-
nity expenditures on social activities,
and myriad others.

We feel, however, that as these have
been worked out in most other instiu-
tions, the burden here should not be
extraordinary.

A Relative Question

While we concede the point that
there may be no educational advant-
age, it is not necessarily true that the
change would be disadvantageous—it

 

The faculty yesterday voted to
form a committee to study plans
to convert to a 5-day week, con-
sidering any and all plans. The
faculty action, however, was not
believed to have been prompted
by this referendum. See related
story, page 1.

 

seems as though after all is consid-
ered, matters of convenience and pref-
erence remain the deciding factors.

Hopefully, this plan will be sub-
mitted to the yet-to-be-appointed com-
mittee for consideration; we are sure
they will use the results of this
referendum as some indication of the
student body's opinion.

vote at the ballot boxes. “Stuffing,”
though probate at some point was
not likely to be any more in
evidence than in other similar votes.

We express our thanks, first to the
faculty for its decision to set up a
study committee, then to those whose
criticism or encouragement helped
this be a fair referendum.

Ballot Comments

A new criticism noted on several
of the ballots in the comments sec-
tion questioned what would happen
in Lexington during the weekends if
the five-day plan is implemented. It
is believed by some that most of the
students would leave Lexington to
enjoy the pleasures of Washington,
New York and other “fun cities.”
This would cripple social activities for
the students unable to leave and the
school would lose much of its spirit.

This criticism accompanied — the
Other standard criticisms of chang-
ing the status quo. And finally a
sympathizer for the Friday Ring-tum
Phi feared if the plan were enacted
it could no longer be late and come
out on Saturday, which is a rare
occasion of course.

 

 

By STEVE SAUNDERS
Vitriol Editor

Of all the so-called “campus is-
sues” raised every year, the most
pointless revolves around the dual
responsibilities of the student Execu-
tive Committee as honor court and
legislature. A proposal to split the
Executive Committee into separate
legislative and judicial units some-
how materializes at the beginning of
spring every year, and this perennial
pattern of regularity suggests some
connection with either the vernal
equinox or massive doses of milk-of-
magnesia in the drinking water. In
either case, the proposal is a bad
one and, as a threat to the Honor
System, it needs to be refuted.

Partisan Claims

The partisans of such a split point
out that the legislative end administra-
tive duties of the EC are often so
heavy that the additional burden of
acting as an honor court endangers
the academic standings of the EC

 

members as well as impairs their

how fairer than that handed down
by the Executive Committee now.
Likewise, the EC would have the
time, if freed from their work as an
honor court, to achieve more as a
deliberative and legislative body.

Viewing the EC as tainted by the
tar-brush of politics, these advocates
insist that a separate honor court
would be more respected by the stu-
dent body, and thus the Honor Sys-
tem would function more effectively.

To all of which, we reply: balder-
dash!

Not So Great

In the first instance, the volume of
legislative work and the number of
honor trials is not so great that the
EC has been forced to limit its ef-
fectiveness in either area. To do so
would be an admission of incompe-
tance, since in a school of 1400 stu-
dents the amount of student legisla-
tive, administrative, and judicial
work needed is very small.

Responsibility for official student
life is divided between the Interfra-
ternity Council and the EC. The IFC
quite possibly has more direct power
and a heavier load of sheer drudgery
to plough through every year than
the EC, albeit on a less grand scale.

 

Student Criticizes Conservatism

Editor's note: Klaus Eder is a
special student at W&L from Burgo-
berbach, Bavaria. He has attended
the University of Frankfurt and ar-
rived in the United States last
September as a Fullbright Scholar,

By KLAUS EDER

My remarks will be very critical;
my arguments might be exaggerated.
But I believe in the functional neces-
sity of radical critique (probably a
part of my German educational herit-
age).

The Graveyard

1) Compared with what was going
on in Frankfurt University when I
left it last summer, the W&L campus
appears like a graveyard; but I also
know this is not typical for American
campuses; | have visited some other
campuses (in the North) where I
could ascertain that people there are
stirred by the same ideas as they
are in Germany, Spain, England etc.
Everywhere students try to locate and
identify the place of the university
and of themselves in an—in_ their
eyes—irrational society.

But nothing (7) like that here (at
least | could never experience an
articulation of such an intellectual
concern)! The Shenandoah Valley
seems to be something like a “glass
cave” where (conservative) “thought”
is protected or rather rendered im-
mune from the outside world and its
challenges. In simple words: the
quiescence of this campus is its basic
characteristic,

Political Conservatism

2) This state of affairs is reflected
in the mentality of most students, |
admit, they are—for a part—interest
ed in politics; but most political ac-
tivity occurs within the framework of
narrow party politics, While trying to
find out the reasons for that I got
mostly one stereo-typical answer
(which sounded like an excuse): we
are conservative, Conservatiem as an

 

ekcuse, an excuse for non-existeni

     
 
  

political ideas which are worth dis-
cussing; students are captured by a
prefabricated frame of reference,
called conservatism,

3) That this campus is fraternity
dominated. They are necessary; for
they have to play the role of a refuge
for social which Lexington itself can-
not provide. But that situation is

worsened by the fact that social life
in fraternities is quite restricted; there
are some—imposed by the University
administration —- house-rules which,

becomes ridiculous, realizing the dif-
ferential treatment of the sophomores
living in fraternity houses and those
living in their apartments. The con-
sequences of that is, that living in
a fraternity house is equal to a kind
of punishment.

Intolerance

4) | was disturbed to see how non-
conformist or radical minorities are
treated on this campus, This deep-

toward all that does not agree with

and habits seems to be a great danger;

groups is a symptom for artificial
exclusiveness: thus students become

Saunders Questions The Validity
Of Dividing EC Responsibilities

The Executive Committee has del-
egated much of its power and duties
to student body committees: Assim-
ilation, Cold Check, Library, and
Student Control. The Dance Board
Operates in a world of its own, re-
sponsible to nobody but a student
public devoid of passion and there-
fore unlikely to complain in any
meaningful way. The EC has noth-
ing to do with the Dance Board,
except for retaining nominal appel-
late jurisdiction that enables it to
“reverse any order” of the Dance
Board, whatever that means. The
same is true for the University Publi-
cations Board, which is autonomous,
but which has its budget approved
by the EC.

It seems fairly obvious that the
number of specific activities the EC
must undertake, aside from admin-
istering the four student body com-
mittees, is small if not nil, The argu-
ment for greater efficiency still has
only tangenial pertinence when ap-
plied to the long laborious process
of interviewing candidates for and ap-
pointing members to the several stu-
dent body committees, since this is a
ritual only undertaken by an incom-
ing EC during the month after their
election, and therefore prior to actual-
ly beginning their term of office.

Dearth of Enthusiasm

The dearth of talent or enthusiasm
for student government at our school
is tragic, and should of itself be
enough to silence those who jabber
about splitting the EC. Where would
we find more men for the honor
court, when we cannot now ade-
quately fill existing vacancies? It is
an unhappy reality, but very con-
crete. At best, we could hope to re-
cruit more second-rate men, and that
we most assuredly do not need.

A separate honor court would at-
tract a type of candidate so fanatically
dedicated, so sincere, and so im-
pressed with his own fine, up-right
true-blue character that there would
be no room in his deliberations for
compassion, nuance, or a reasonable
doubt. As long as the honor court
consits, as it does now in the form
of the EC, of men with a good grasp
on reality, and not of a sanctimon-
ious panel of Pharasaical goody-
goodies, we can expect what Mackin-
lay Kanto once called, “An Honest
Man's Legal Justice.” According to
the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition, we
have the right to be judged by a
jury of our peers. This means, in an
admittedly narrow Lexington conteat,
being judged by real people and not
by a special caste of “honorable men”
whose pedigree seems based on their
ability to see the world in crisp, easily
differentiated blacks and whites.

And this result would be inevitable
if we have a separate honor court

and game me 50 centimes, mumbling
some sympathetic Latin. The most
philosophical response came from a
man who was digging a hole in the
road near the Are de Triomphe. He

said ‘Il fait son voulot, moi le mien.
Alor on est content’ (He does his
work and I do mine. Everybody's

happy that way).

Nobody really wanted to elaborate,
however, on his opinion, good or
bad: perhaps too embarrassed by vis-
ions of an England ‘au naturel’, a
fractured Canada and a defoliated
dollar.

France’s Press Agent

All these observations on le Presi-
dent’s style, public image and great
humility leave the crucial question
unanswered, however: who is he and
what is he after? De Gaulle is France’s
press agent, an undercover PR man.
He has enough intelligence to realize
that France must have tourists, tour-
ists, tourists and he uses the best
method to get them—publicity, pub-
licity, publicity. We must admit that
de Gaulle has an eager and prolific
press, and France has been turning ”
in the most unlikely places.

De Gaulle glories in the free cov-
erage of all his chauvinistic outbursts,
for he knows that no matter how un-
acceptable the words of him mouth
and the meditation of his heart may
be, the medium is the message. Some
people think that tourism will slack
off as a result of Gaullist gall, but
I think not: did you ever see people
flocking to the scene of a grisly acci-
dent?

General de Gaulle is a 19th cen-
tury man who is following in the

 

Napoleonic tradition that is so dear
to very Frenchman. The French are |
ambivalent about the present leader |
because he represents la Grande |
France which long ago died with the |
rise of the Super-powers. The awken-
ing to changes in the world power
structure has already come to the
other European countries, de Gaulle
hangs on.

Saunders Discusses Split

‘Continued from page 2)

Lee has preserved its character (or
what's left of it) by denying this
dichotomy of politics and honor, by
compelling students to elect honor-
able men to the EC because, in addi-
tion to acting as a representative
body, they might someday be judge
and jury in their honor trial. There
is no reason to change that now, The
Honor System does not need it, and
quite possibly could not survive it.

With so much pressing business
begging for attention, the EC would
be unwise to rehearse the well-worn |
arguments for and against this ill
conceived proposal. It ts not a campus |
and should not become one. |

Platform Committee Chairman
Schedules Hearings For April

By JOHN HUGHES

The platform committee for the
1968 Mock Republican Convention
wil conduct several open hearings
early next month,

The formation of the committee
and the hearings are further efforts
to make the W&L mock political
event as authentic as possible.

Under the chairmanship of Drew
Colclough, a senior law student from
Arlington, the committee has been
busy contacting Republican leaders
in Washington and across the coun-
try, getting their views on what the
platform should contain.

“We will try to write a platform
which reflects the true spirit of the
Republican Party on the major issues,”
commented Colclough, “and a_plat-
form on which the nominee could
run.” Former Oklahoma Gov. Henry
Bellmont will present the platform to
the opening session of the Mock
Convention May 3.

“What we need,” said Colclough,
“is for the people in the party— not
only the governors and senators, but
the real convention delegates, the
people in contact with the people back
home—to take the time to jot down
their views on what the major issues
are, and what their thinking is on
them.”

At the same time, the Republican
Party can benefit, since Colclough’s

Professor From Brown U.

Will Present Talk Tonight;
Physicist Here Mar. 14

The Department of Physics pre-
sents Dr. E. A. Mason, Professor of
Physics at Brown University, tonight
at 8 o'clock in New Science 201. He
wil speak on “Molecular Rainbows
and Glories—Waves and Particles.”
rhe talk is open to the public.

Thursday, March 14th, there will
be a physics seminar featuring Dr.
W. D. Whitehead, Director of Center
For Advance Studies at the University
of Virgina, who will speak on “A
New View of X-Ray lonization of
Gases.”

For the last five years Dr. White-
head has been using an_ electron
synchrotron to investigate experiment-
ally the interaction of photons with
nuclei. These experiments give in-
teresting information about the struc-
ture of highly excited states and about
shapes of various nuclei. He is in-
terested in the production of neutrons
by interaction of photons with nuclei.
He has also been working with mul-
tiple ionization processes in atoms and
the lifetimes of states in ionized
atoms.

There will be a coffee at 4:30 p.m.
to be followed by the seminar from

 

 

5-6 p.m. Both will take place in
New Science 201.

W ycherley’s “The Country Wife”

committee plans to send a copy of
its platform to every delegate to the
real GOP convention in Miami.

The Republican views will be pre-
sented at the hearings, set for April
10-11, through the student spokes-
men for the various state delegations.

“Anyone who wants to testify may
contact me at Mock Convention head-
quarters in Lexington,” Colclough
said, ‘by mail, in person or by tele-
phone. If they like, they can submit
statesments in writing to the com-
mittee.”

The main emphasis of Colclough
and his 11-man committee is to draft
a platform that will closely parallel
the real thing. “It’s got to be a credit-
able and professional document,” he
said.

English Department Offers
Prose And Poetry Awards

By FRANK ROSE

The Washington and Lee English
department is offering two awards in
creative writing this spring. They are
the Mahan Awards for poetry and
prose and the Academy of American
Poets award in poetry.

The Mahan Awards consist of two
freshman prose awards, one sopho-
more prose award, one junior prose
award, and one verse award open to
anyone in the College except seniors.
The poetry award is given to the
best poem or group of poems sub-
mitted to the English department.

The Mahan Awards carry a $100
exemption from college fees for the
year following the one in which the
award is made, or $60 in cash. The
winners will be announced during
Commencement in June. The winner
of the poetry award will receive a
$100 prize.

According to Dr. Severn Duvall,
head of the English department, the
Mahan Awards were set up “to en-
courage and reward creative writing
among undergraduates. An endow-
ment for this purpose was received

As Convention Grand Marshal

Tennessee Congressman William E. Brock III will serve
as parade grand marshal at Washington and Lee University’s

Mock Republican Convention

here May 3-4.

Rep. Brock, a Washington and Lee alumnus, will ride in
the place of honor at the head of the traditonal convention
parade on Friday afternoon, May 3.

The parade, featuring floats from*—-—-——-

dozens of state delegations and re-
splendent with state beauty queens
and bands, will wind through Lex-
ington’s downtown streets to Doremus
Gymnasium, site of the mock political
event,

Rep. Brock has had one other previ-
ous experience with the Washington
and Lee’s mock convention. As a
student here in 1952, he was a mem-
ber of the Tennessee delegation to
the convention which nominated
Dwight Eisenhower for the presi-
dency.

Rep. Brock, a conservative, was
elected to Congress in 1962, the first
Republican to represent Tennessee's
3rd District in 42 years. He was re-
elected in 1964 and again in 1966.

A businessman (he is a vice presi-
dent and director of the Brock Candy
Co. founded by his grandfater) and
civic leader, he was chosen two years
ago as Chattanooga's “Young Man
of the Year.”

A native of Chattanooga, Rep.
Brock attended McCallie School and
received his B.S. in commerce from
Washington and Lee in 1953, He
served 34 years of active duty in
the Far East as a naval officer.

The Congressman’s father, W. E.
Brock Jr., also is a Washington and
Lee alumnus (Class of 1925) and
is a former president and Board
chairman of Brock Candy Co.

In a resolution passed at its regular
March meeting Monday, the faculty

nary service” in his dual role as the
acting president and dean, adding that
he “secured the united support of
faculty and students worked
diligently among alumni and parents

out Virginia this season by the Vir-
ginia Museum Theatre Arts System.

the Museum's statewide performing
arts system, the Metropolitan Opera
Studio Ensemble will present a speci-
ally designed program of songs and
arias based on Shakespearean text,
some of them from rarely heard
operas.

Program of Shawespeare

Shakespearean operas, including Ros-
sini's “Othello,” Gounod’s “Romeo
and Juliet,” and Thomas’ “Hamlet”;
songs from plays by Shakespeare;
and, adding a contemporary elment
melodies from Cole Porter's “Kiss
Me Kate,” the Broadway musical
based on “The Taming of the Shrew.”

Remarks On VASG

Although the Tuesday Edition’s remarks
on the subject of the Virginia Association of
Student Governments (VASG) contained
much that was true and pertinent, we fear they
have missed the point.

It is quite inaccurate to suggest that we are
possessed by a “passion for joining” the
VASG. We are aware that the EC did not
originally reject membership back in Decem-
ber without having what seemed to them good
reasons for doing so. We are also aware that
those reasons still exist. What we question is
whether those reasons are so strong that they
absolutely preclude joining VASG; or, con-
versely, that VASG offers so few advantages
that it is not worth the trouble of investigat-
ing further. So far, neither point has been
proved to our satisfaction. And there are very
good reasons for maintaining an active interest
in the organization. We’ve heard plenty of
arguments lately in favor of maintaining our
splendid isolation. “Washington and Lee does
not have a great deal in common with other
colleges in Virginia,” runs the argument. “Call
it snobbishness if you will (we prefer ‘pride’) :
but we have, in our name, something to pro-
tect that a lot of schools simply don’t.”

In last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi, however,
there appeared an article which, although its
writer did not intend it as an answer to such
an argument, nevertheless has bearing upon
it. The writer, a foreign student, remarked:

“Compared with what was going on in
Frankfurt University when I left it last sum-
mer, the W&L campus appears like a grave
yard; but I know this is not typical for Ameri-
can campuses...

The Shenandoah Valley seems to be some-
thing like a ‘glass-cave’ where (conservative)
‘thought’ is protected or rather rendered
immune from the outside world and its chal-
lenges. In simple words: the quiescence of
this campus is its basic characteristic.

“This state of affairs is reflected in the
mentality of most students ... While trying to
find out the reasons for that I got mostly
one stereo-typical answer (which sounded like
an excuse) : we are conservative. Conservatism
is an excuse, an excuse for non-existent politi-
cal ideas which are worth discussing . . .”

* *

We can’t escape the feeling that the de-
fense of our “good name“ is only another
excuse for protection and immunity from “the
outside world and its challenges.”

We are not suggesting now, and have never
suggested, that VASG is the only means by
which W&L can make a step toward some
kind of involvement. The disadvantages of
membership might outweigh the advantages,
just as the EC argues. Other organizations
might be more suited to our needs, But VASG
membership might be the right step, and we
will never know unless positive action is taken
to weigh its advantages and disadvantages. It
is not enough to say, “The VASG must come
to us, not us to them.” We not only must
come to them, to look them over and watch
their development, but we must also keep an

bees *

eye on similar organizations and problems to
which we may be invited in future.

* *

All of which leads us to approve heartily
of the news that VASG’s president—on his
own initiative—plans to visit W&L within the
next two weeks for the purpose, presumably,
of presenting his organization’s case to the

BC.

Give Us Our Saturdays!

Now that the proponents of the five-day
class week have had their say, may we raise
at least one voice in favor of keeping the
six-day week just as we have it? Frankly, the
idea of crowding the same amount of work
into a lesser period of time with longer classes
and a longer class day does not appeal to us;
and we can hardly believe that most students,
if they really thought about the alternatives,
would prefer a five-day week. (Can you
imagine getting up at 7:45 some Monday
morning—class starts in fifteen minutes—and
trying to sort out what week-block it is, and
what time-block section B falls in today—or
is it tomorrow? Can you imagine getting up
at 7:45 at all?)

So far, we’ve seen nothing in all the argu-
ments for the five-day class week that indicates
its superiority to the present one. In fact, its
backers cheerfully admit “there is no educa-
tional benefit to be derived from the change.”
They argue that, on the other hand, “it is not
necessarily true that the change would be dis-
advantageous.” Well, maybe not. But after
all, the burden of proof lies on those who
want to make the change, not on those who
would like to keep the much simpler schedule
we have now.

Faculty Disinterest

And while we’re on the subject of polls,
it has come to our attention that barely 40%
of the faculty polled concerning their opinions
on the war in Vietnam (see lead article on
this page) bothered to return the forms.

Each form was delivered by campus mail
to the 145 members of the faculty. It was
accompanied by a request to return the forms
via campus mail to a certain professor’s mail-
box. Intra-campus mail need only be placed
in an envelope and addressed; no stamp is
necessary; it is altogether without cost. And
if the location of an envelope poses a problem,
the form could simply be folded, stapled, and
addressed on the back.

Which brings us to the point: why was
there only 40% return? Accusations of apathy
generally spew forth from the faculty to the
student body; in this case, the student body
turned out in droves (80%) to respond to
a poll on Saturday classes which only two years
ago received a response of 50%.

Thus, due to the fact that 60%, of the fac-
ulty proved too lazy to answer this poll, the
only conclusion that can be drawn concerning
the results is that the results are inconclusive.

Only 40 Per Cent Respond

 

Faculty Shows Anti-War Sentiments

Forty-two per cent of the Wash-
ington and Lee University faculty
have responded to a poll taken by
the Friday Edition of the Ring-tum
Phi concerning their opinions on the
war in Vietnam and the draft. Both
the ages and departments of these
answering the poll were requested
on the confidential forms.

Of the forty-two percent respond-
ing, 58.9 per cent answered that they
were opposed to the war in Vietnam,
while 17.8 per cent considered them-
selves to be proponents of the war;
23.3 per cent were either undecided,
or checked “Other.”

The results which follow are based
upon the number of respondants
answering the individual question
(some did or could not answer cer-
tain questions):

Do you believe that a majority
of the people of South Vietnam
support the National Liberation
Front (Viet Cong) or the Siagon
(Thieu-Ky) Regime?

Dear Sir:

The faculty has indicated by its
insistance upon deferred rush that the
fraternity system at WA&L must be
modified. The faculty is probably cor-
rect in its analysis that the system is
over-emphasized, but they are mis-
taken in thinking that a deferred rush
would correct the situation,

What the fraternity system needs is
competition where it is strongest:
competition in social life. What they
appeal to are social aspects of a stu-
dents life. A fraternity is (1) a place
to party, (2) a source of transporta-
tion, (3) a source of dates, (4) a
change of food. What a fraternity is
not, at least here at WAL, is a
mystical bond linking certain people;
nor is it a place of intellectual stimula-
hon.

They are the only social life at
WAL. A deferred rush would only
aggravate a nasty situation, During

View From The Footbridge

 

 

By JERRY PERLMAN

Friday Sports Editor

It’s been three weeks since this
columnist broke the Eleventh Com-
mandment—‘“Thou shalt not
(choose your favorite vice)—and pro-
posed that Washington and Lee
seriously consider withdrawing _ its
membership from the College Athletic
Conference. Since then, conference
championships have been held in three
sports, and, jumpin’ Doremus: the
Five-Star Generals have picked up
two firsts and a second place, plac-
ing them firmly atop the standings in
the race for the “funky funky rail-
road bell.”

So what? Not to take anything
away from the W&L athletes who
participated, the victories meant about
as much as the conference itself. The
basketball win did not messrs. Neer,
Cartwright, Wesselink, and Co. an

bid was wrapped up long before St.

headed for warmer climes.

What are the alternatives to CAC
membership? Where can a small all
men’s college nestled in the Shenan-
doah Valley find true athletic happi-
ness? Several factors limit choices,
but the alternatives are there, and,
as the old cliche goes, “nothing
ventured, .. .”

Mason-Dixon Proposal

It has been suggested that Wash-
ington and Lee find and apply for
membership in an already-established
conference that does not have the
drawbacks of the CAC. This would
mean a conference of sufficient size,
playing an adequate number of sports,
and with schools in close enough

lacrosses, (for which W&L is in a
separate league already) enough other
teams are fielded to make for a going-

is the fact that Washington and Lee

Mound Strength And Overall Depth Vital Recuse

As Lyles Sends Charges Through Opening Drills

By THUNDER THORNTON

Coach Joe Lyles has welcomed a
large turn-out and the warm skies of
the past week in preparing for the
Generals’ upcoming baseball season.
Commenting on the impending sched-
ule, Coach Lyles noted that all the
opponents will be tough, and that
today he could not say “which ones
we can win.” But the consensus is
that the Generals can improve some-
what on last spring's record.

The candidates have been drilling
outdoors this week and the embryo
of a lineup is beginning to form.
Coach Lyles has a steady co-captain,
Tom Mitchell, to build around, and
several other returnees. With Mitchell
in center and last year’s leading hitter,
Jim Wilson, flanking him in left, the
outfield has two strong performers.

In the infield, steady sophomore
John Nolan can be counted on at
third base, and Gil Fitzhugh, who has
played previously but sat out last
year, is trying a new position. Behind
the plate will be Jack Baizley, who
played well as a freshman last spring.

New Blood
The only other real experience is
accounted for in pitchers Bill Ras-
mussen, the other co-captain, and
Lee Halford. However, new talent is
ready to fill the gaps. Transfer student

New Mentor Added
To PE Department

The appointment of S. Sydnor
Walden as assistant professor of
physical education, head track coach,
and assistant football coach at Wash-
ington and Lee University is slated
for announcement tomorrow by Dr.
William W. Pusey Hl, Dean of the
College.

Presently athletic director at Epis-
copal High School in Alexandria,
Walden, 50, will assume his duties
at Washington and Lee Sept. 1, 1968.

A native of Richmond, he is gradu-
ate of Hampden-Sydney College and
holds a master’s degree in history
from the University of Richmond,

After a four-year tour of duty
with the Navy, when he served
aboard a minesweeper in the Pacific,
Walden joined the faculty at Epsicopal

 

in 1946 an dtaugh history, math, and
French.

During his tenure at Episcopal, he
has coached football, basketball, base-
ball, and track.

He was appointed athletic director
in 1957 when Lee McLaughlin re-
signed the post to become head foot-
ball coach at WAL.

Walden is married to the former
Anne Easley of Lynchburg, and the
couple has three children—S. Sydnor

Walden Jr., Suzanne Walden, and
Sally Tucker Walden.
He is also presently serving as

assistant director of Camp Maxwelton,
a local summer camp run by new
Washington and Lee Athletic Director
Lee McLaughlin.

Of ‘Wonders’

The “Green Gourd” was hurtling
down Route 11 at breakneck speed.
Tense thoughts flashed through the
minds of driver and navigator alike.
They had already lost precious min-
utes by making two wrong turns,
How far would they be off from the
correct time?

It was approximately 6:30 p.m. on
March 2, 1968, when Brian Price and
his navigator Joe Chadwick drove
across the finish line to make W&L
history. They had just won the first
“Seven Wonders of Rockbridge” auto

rally, although they weren't even
aware they had finished at all. Fortu-
nately, they spied assistant Rally-

master Bob Gastrock waving them
down at the hidden finish line, and
their weatherbeaten Plymouth Valiant
ground to a halt.

Price, wearing a white mechanic's
suit and pilot’s cap ‘a la Snoopy,
climbed out of the car to hear the
bad news. How many cars had come
in before theirs? Rallymaster Roger
Clarke then broke the news. The
Price-Chadwick team was the only
one to have finished, and was only a
few minutes off the correct time. As
time ticked away, and
waited for the also-rans, Clarks and
Gastrock realized something was a-

miss. Only one other car managed to!

finish, that of Stafford Keegin, a law
student, and his wife. Another car,
driven by Ring-tum Phi staffer Ron
Kessler along with Mark Eaker, was
awarded third after finishing in the
wrong spot.

The problem came at the last
turn. The instructions told the drivers
to head north at an intersection. Be-
cause only one car had a compass,
and all the cars expected the rally to
end at Clarke's DU house, they all
took the road into Lexington. Need-
less to say, it was the wrong road.
The Goeff Kuhn-Tom Mullenix team,
the one car with a compass, had

The keynote session will convene
at 4:00 p.m. Highlighting the prelimi-
naries is a welcoming speech by Mayor
Douglas Brady, presumably for the
purpose of acquainting visitors with
the wonders of “world-famous Rock-
bridge County.”

The report of the Committee on
Credentials is likely to stir the first
controversy (provided someone doesn’t

take exception to the National
Anthem.) The Convention will vote
on challenges made against any

delegation—one vote per state.

Sometime in the midst of the de-
tailed proceedings, Gov. Claude Kirk
will deliver the keynote address, after
which the convention will formally
elect as “permanent officers” the
people who have been running it
all along.

After a break for supper, the plat-
form session will convene at 7:15
p.m. Here all delegates can vote
autonomously and debate specific
controversial planks. In each case,

 

The CAC: Getting Out
Can Be Half The Fun
For Washington and Lee

(Continued on page 3)

(Roanoke and Old Dominion in par-
ticular) and others, for various rea-
sons, are thinking about leaving the
group. It would be riduculous for
WAL to consider petitioning for mem- |
bership until the Mason-Dixon in-|
sures its own existence.

Another suggestion that is making
the rounds is the formation of a
band-new, all Virginia conference.
This idea has much appeal through-
out the state, but nothing concrete has
been done. Remembering the difficul-
ties Washington and Lee has been
having with the Virginia Intercoll-
legiate Soccer Association (VISA),
which we were instrumental in found-
ing, | would caution the University
to proceed slowly with this idea, not
committing ourselves until others do
the same, and not before all the
schools involved have dropped their
previous conference obligations.

For The Time Being

The final proposition is, I feel, the
best one to follow at the present time.
Washington and Lee should drop
from the CAC and become, at least
for the time being, an independent
school. This would in no way affect
our athletic schedules, since, except
for football, CAC considerations do
not at present enter into regular sea-
son scheduling. As an independent,
we could “shop around,” bide our
time, and, if it were decided that
membership in a conference was de-
sired, find the one that best suited
our athletic needs and aspirations, and
apply for admission. It's been four-
teen years since Washington and Lee
was a member of a “real” conference.
A little more waiting won't hurt until
a worthy successor to the pre-1954
days is found,

Such an innovation in the conven-
tion program may be the most in-
formative and interesting for students,
even those whose interest in politics
is Only peripheral, according to Col-
clough, and should serve to increase
meaningful participation by all stu-
dents, as well as adding to the stricter

What ARE
W&L Freshmen
Thinking About

(Continued from page 2)
working together.

 

Q. If you were able to change one
thing about the University, what
would you like to change?

Once again it is impossible to list
all the responses, but the ideas that
had substantial backing should be
mentioned, By substantial backing I
mean those that were mentioned by
more than 30 per cent of the people
interviewed,

More liberal academic requirements
for both science and non-science stu-
dents was continually brought up.
Many freshmen felt that students |
seeking a degree in history, political |
science, English, or like courses should
not have to take the same math and
science course as a pre-med or science
major. By the same token, science
students should not have to take the
same English or history courses as
the people majoring in those fields.
For those students whose major is
undecided, the option of taking regu-
lar freshman courses in all subjects
should remain.

A trimester system was also a fa-
vorite topic for discussion. Almost
half of the freshmen interview ex-
pressed an interest in a system in
which exams would be before Christ-
mas holidays, and in which there
would possibly be a period of inde-
pendent study, Examples of other uni-
versities which are attempitng this
were cited, and there seemed to be
a great deal of support for such a
system.

 

| tions, and a long list of other not-

| More effective fund-raising was of

prime concern to many freshmen.
| Most freshmen seemed to realize the
| great possibilities for expansion and
| improvements of the university if only

 

 

there was more financial support from
| the alumni and other interested parties.
Other changes suggested by fresh-
men included abolishment of Satur-
day classes, more lenient dorm regula-

quite-so-important items.

Probably the most important thing
shown by the freshman response to
these and many other questions is
the significant awareness and con-
cern for Washington and Lee's future
that has been demonstrated. For the
most part, the freshmen have not
succumbed to the feeling of apathy
which seems to have become em-
bedded in the majority of their elder
classmates.

Next week freshman ideas about
specific features on campus now and
in the future will be presented as they
were given to me in response to cer-
tain questions, These ideas should
prove interesting to both students and
faculty

man was called back to the piano
four times. The selections for his

acterizes this convention,

While all these preliminaries re-
quire a great deal of preparation by
a great many people, obviously the
overriding concern of the convention
is predicting correctly the Republican
candidate for President. Nominations
for the nominee will be taken Friday
night amid small riots, “spontaneous
demonstrations,” and other such dig-
nified ceremonies which ordinarily
surround these weighty decisions on
a national level.

Balloting, which is to be strictly
controlled by state chairmen, will
occur in both the Saturday sessions.
After a nominee for President is de-
cided upon, the anti-climactic busi-
ness of choosing his running mate
will close the convention, and dele-
gates will then be free to celebrate
or release excess energies and frustra-
tions over lost causes.

leg when they demolished their car
in an accident.

The winning Price-Chadwick team
had gone into Lexington along with
everybody else. After searching the
town for a finish line, they turned
around and retraced their steps to
the previous intersection. This time
they made the correct guess.

Only twenty-eight cars enterted the
rally, and as a result, there is some
doubt as to whether another will be
held. Officials Clarke and Gastrock
encountered several unforeseen prob-
lems. Also, the registration fee charg-
ed was not enough to pay for ex-
penses in light of the small turn-out,
Second place finisher Keegin had
been planning to hold another one
later this month,

If there is another rally, the win-
ning team has mixed opinions on
entering. Driver Price has said, “I’m
content to rest on my laurels,” but
navigator Chadwick is enthuiastic, “It
was a test of great navigational and
driving skill. My years of training
have paid off.”

University of the powerful Mid-
America Conference and the annual
spring trip to Florida as crucial. Also,
the Virginia small college teams have
improved greatly, especially Old
Dominion, which had its best fresh-
man team ever last spring.

However, with the maturing of the
Generals’ improtant middel combina-
tion of Kalista and Fitzhugh and the
expected performance of the veterans,
Washington and Lee can hope for a
brighter spring, baseball-wise, than
that of last year.

30 Years Ago
In The Ring-tum Phi

Seven fraternity servants examined

by Dr. Reid White had advanced cases
of syphilis, There were no traces of
swnorrhesn or tuherculo n the

servanis who were cAamined

half of the seventeenth century. The
play is written in the genre of the
Comedy of Manners school.
London Set

rhe setting of “The Country Wife”
is London during the 1680's. Horner,
a Londoner, devises an idea to aid
his amorous adventures, He pays Dr.
Quack to spread the rumor that be-
cause of an operation for the pox,
Horner is now sterile. The “country
wife” of the title is the beautiful
young wife of Mr. Pinchwife. Pinch-
wife, who has secretly married her
in the country, brings her to London.

There she is attracted to the theatre.
Because of her physical charms, she
gains the attention of many men,
especially Horner, who is completely
taken by her. The play continues with
various intrigues, seductions, and
counter-seductions. By the end, how-
ever, everything works out, and the
characters pair off with their proper
mates,

The direction of the play is being
handeled by student director Don

Last night the Executive Commit-
tee selected Herb Crenshaw, Lee Hal-
ford, Danny Leonard and Pete Hen-
dricks to consider the selection of a
student to receive the Gilliam Prize
and to accept recommendations from
students, faculty and administration
for candidate for the award.

Criterion Listed

The criterion by which the prize
is judged were listed by the EC.

The student must have made a
valuable contribution to student
affairs. This contribution might take
the form of outstanding contribu-
tion in one field or in many fields.

It shall not be necessary that the
recipient have held any particular
office or position. It should seem

that special attention should be
given to the student who has pro-

vided the necessary leadership to
re-activate a sluggish organization
or establish a functioning organiza-
tion with a worthwhile purpose.

The student should not have merely

performed an important job well,

but should have done an outstand-

 

to correspond as closely as possible
with their original seventeenth-cen-
tury counterparts. This task is the
responsibility of David Hall, a sculp-

; :
tor in the fine arts department.

Crenshaw Book
Traces History

Of This School

Professor Ollinger Crenshaw has
announced the completion of his his-
tory of Washington and Lee, which
has been in the works since post-
World War Il days. The book, en-
titled “General Lee's College—The
Rise and Growth of Washington and
Lee.” traces the school from its very
humble beginnings in the 18th cen-
tury through its crises and glories up
to 1930, after which an epilogue fol-
lows which brings the book up to
the 60's.

The book comprehensively covers
the growth of the school, and has
been thoroughly documented and re-
searched, attested to by Dr. Cren-
shaw’s many trips around the country
and tireless groping around musty and
somber libraries.

In choosing the name of his book,
Dr. Crenshaw admits no idolatry of
Genera! Lee, simply pointing out that
Lee “put the school on the map, it
having beforehand been a remote and
provincial college.” Washington Col-
lege first came to fame not under
that name, but as “General Lee's”
College. as Lee's connection to the
school brought admiring Southerners
from all sections of the South,

Although the sources of informa-
tion on the school were sometimes
scanty and fragmentary (especially in
the 18th and early 19th centuries),
Dr. Crenshaw has followed the de
velopment of the college closely with
attention to the curriculum, the stu
dent life, the changing influence of
the presidents, the effect of national

Hitchens To Lead Seminar
On New American Cinema

A three-session seminar on the New
American Cinema, led by Gordon
Hitchens, editor of “Film Comment,”
will take place at Washington and
Lee University March 18 under the
auspices of the University’s Depart-
ment of Journalism and Communica-
tions.

Under the title “The American
Avant Garde and Independent Film,”
the seminar will explore the current
explosive production by young Ameri-
can film makers of documentary, ex-
perimental and underground films.

Leading Film Makers

In addition to his editorship of one
of the leading film publications of
the country, Hitchens is himself a
leading maker. He is an assistant pro-
fessor in the Communications Arts
Department of the New York Insti-
tute of Technology, film instructor in
the School of Visual Arts of the
Horace Mann School, New York, and
the American’ representative and
panelist at the film festivals at Mann-
heim, West Germany; Leipzig, East
Germany; and Florence, Italy. He is
a frequent speaker at university film
centers, and the author of numerous
articles on the film.

General Orientation

Hitchens will present a general
orientation on contemporary indepen-
dent film making at the morning ses-
sion of the seminar, including an
analysis of aims, content and signifi-
cant practioners. Afternoon and eve-
ning sessions will be devoted to the
screening of representative samples of
avant garde films, with commentary
by Hitchens.

Between sessions Hitchens will
meet informally with students and
discuss production problems with
those students making films this
semester.

Anti-parietalism

There can be little argument, we think, with Mr. Timmerman’s
letter in the Friday Edition asking for, among other things, a
bit of twentieth-century thinking about dormitory regulations.
It seems at times that the rules of which he speaks actually
antedate the dorms themselves, and that makes them very,
very outdated indeed.

But the prospect for change is not bright. In one of the
few less-than-satisfactory sections of the Self-Study Report,
it is written that the dorms consist of nothing but bedrooms
and that it is considered inappropriate to allow students to
“entertain women” in them. When one is a freshman, though,
there is nothing else to be had at any price—and dorm rooms
become, of necessity, living-rooms, dens, studies and even
kitchens, as well as bedrooms. It is not the University, nor any
committee thereof, that decides in which of these capacities
the dorm rooms would be serving if women visited them. In
dealing with the dorms, bedroominess lies in the mind of the

beholder.

Mr. Timmerman and the Tuesday Edition could probably
both write endlessly, though, and not change the University’s
Augusta-Academy-era thinking. Not only does the Self-Study
invite no optimism about parietal-regulations-change, but it
even demands other kinds of Orwellian supervision: “im-
mediate priority’ was given in the report to the “need” to
institute “regular health and safety inspection of all living
quarters occupied by students,” specifically and arrogantly
including apartments.

Perhaps we should resurrect a plan that was inexplicably
discarded last year when the dorms question was so big: stop
talking about “requiring” anybody to live in dorms; chalk
up the existing dorms as lost causes, as gross mistakes; build
into new dorms the conveniences and attractions of apartments
(benefits which, compared with what the dorms offer now,
are too numerous to be mentioned); finally—and most im-
portantly—charge rents which are low enough that, when
combined with the comparative physical benefits and the
suspension of humiliating, mama-esque rules, students will
voluntarily seek to occupy them. It might take several addi-
tional years to pay off mortgages on dorms which are not
monastic cells, but might even that not be to the University’s
long-run advantage?

Who says...

.. . that symposia at Washington and Lee exhibit a “depress-
ing sameness as to topic”? Why, this Friday, Professor Duvall,
chairman of the Department of English, is delivering a talk
entitled “Some Observations on the Southern Romance” to—
would you believe? —the Chemistry Seminar.

 

Staff Editorial

‘They're using us as bait’

No occurrence epitomizes the malady of the Vietnam conflict as well
as the isolation of the Marine garrison at Khe Sanh and the despair sweeping
its beseiged occupants. That the 4,800 Marines in the camp are “bait,” at
least for the delight of the 20,000 or more NVA surrounding this outpost,
is becoming increasingly apparent. With little hope of air evacuation or a
significant increase in direct troop commitment, the beleaguered await what
David Leitch calls the “coup de grace,” the end of their war.

Leitch is a correspondent for the London Sunday Times who visited the
camp and interviewed 60 Americans, His report was printed in the February
25 issue of the Washington Post. In his analysis, this foreign observer found
the troops depressed and embittered at their “government and generals.” And
yet, according to Leitch, if and when the battle comes, the men will fight.
But then, what else could they do? The enemy cannot and will not absorb
4,800 POWs.

Not sheltered by deferments and white protective columns, these young
men are facing an issue which all of us in Lexington are still trying to
avoid. Indeed, it is quite easy to be “patriotic” at W&L-——particularly if you
ignore the war and harbor sweet dreams of continuing the educational womb
in graduate school, But now, because of Louis Hershey, even “minks” are
going to confront this existential question sooner or later.

For the Marines in Khe Sanh, however, this decision has already been
made. But—what should be of great concern to all of us—is the fact that
their resolve appears to be one not based on conviction but on the tragedy
of circumstance

Assuming these direct quotations represent the consensus of the men
that he interviewed, Leitch credits them as saying:

“Kindly get me out of here. I'll go on a chopper, I'l parachute
If you insist man, 1 walk, but just take me out of this place.”

“I the planes can't come any more, then the Reds are going to
attack. What are they [NVA] going to do? You don't have to ask
that question, friend. They just have to start running over that wire
when it's dark and we kill a few of them and they keep coming
and then we say good night, No problem there,”

“| write my wife all the time. Naturally, | couldn't get away
with telling her what's really going on—nobody Stateside knows
that, and if they did know they'd blow their minds.”

“You tell them they're using us as bait.”

there? What is the military rationale behind such
an ultimately indefensible commitment? Is the reason for our presence
there really as a “bait"? And if so, to whom is this baiting directed? Is,
then, the purpose of such an engagement to make legitimate our total effort
with a renewed national sense of moral righteousness? Do we want to proclaim
“Remember Khe Sanh” in this election year?

The answers to such questions deserve our increasing atiention, even
for those of us secure within the confines of Rockbridge County, Hopefully,
our own sensitive shoulders will not have to bear the guilt of moral inactivity
in face of a likely battle at Khe Sanh. But if there is a fight, the Marines
will die for our detachment

It's a shame they don't want to, It rather ruins the story

But why are “we”

Ring-tum Phi: | suppose the first ques-
tion I should ask you, Don, is how
did you first get interested in drama?
Don Baker: Oh, | suppose it was in
high school. I did a one-act in my
senior year for English. It was fun,
but I really wasn’t too excited about
it. | didn’t do anything here until my
sophomore year when I took an act-
ing class because | thought it might
be interesting. The first role I ever
had here was Lucky: a part in (“Wait-
ing for) Godot.” Then I got the lead
in the next one which was “Richard
II,” and I've been with it ever since.
R-t Phi: How did you eventually be-
come interested in directing?

around with everything in each show.
I could never just worry about my-
self. It was the whole show.

R-t Phi: Had you ever done any
directing before this?

Baker: Yes, last year | directed a one-
act called “Pull Out His Eyes” as a
project for the directing class I was
in. Then we did “Midsummer Night's
Dream” this summer. I decided it
would be fun to do so I got some
of my friends together here in Lex-
ington, and we put it on.

R-t Phi: How did you get the job of
directing “Country Wife?”

Baker: I don't know. I guess Mr.
Kahn just decided he wanted to have
one student director a year and he
picked me. He sure did pick a diffi-
cult show for me to handle, through.
R-t Phi: Why?

Baker: Because for this show you
need flamboyant costumes and we had
a limited budget as well as a director
with 'imited experience. We had to
have the costumes made by Martha
Stuart, Dabney Stuart’s wife, and
Sandra Wilhelm, a student at South-
ern Sem. David Hall had to get the
set made with almost no money and
we had to put it on this dinky stage.
We really needed a long and narrow
stage to produce this play in period
style. The style was such that if two
actors entered from opposite ends of
the stage, they weren't supposed to be
able to see each other. It's kind of

ly” attacked during the past week
at Washington and Lee. The first on-
slaught came last week in this edition
of the paper with a story by German
special student Klaus Eder. He criti-
cized WAL for its conservatism and
“intolerance” toward “non-conform-
ing groups.” A more stinging extension
of his remarks by an unidentified stu-
dent (see Letters to the Editor on
this page) further castigates conserva-
tism and W&L’s “intolerance.”

It seems obvious from both of
these writers that they have a belief
that conservatism is tantamount to
apathy while liberalism is where the
action is. Surely there is a degree of
apathy at W&L; but it is not typical
of the conservatives or those that work
in the “narrow party politics.” Rather
than apathy here, we have one of the
most outstanding examples of mature,
constructive action in the country. A
story in the Tuesday Edition last fall
cited that W&L has one of the high-
est percentages of political club mem-
berships in the nation. Fully 60 per
cent of the student body belong to

In the small far-off town of Sume-
rod, one would expect nothing to
occur. Sumerod is a pleasant, staid
town about the size of Lexington; the
life rarely changes; it is lived in
the good way—the way their fathers
lived. Change, odious as it is, was
rarely contemplated by the good
citizens of Sumerod,

Yet there was a small clique of
evil, corrupt men who desired change;
what they called improvement was
in fact a giving-up of the old proven
good for the uncharted evils of the
future. The town was run by an old
man: a man once of great dynamic
qualities, but now quite faded. Mayor
Wobbley restricts his activities to a
daily round of golf and an occasional
visit to his office to sign that which
needs being signed

bers of the “most blessed” are exempt-

those working in the party system.

Monopoly On Tolerance
Surely liberals have no monopoly
on tolerance. Three immediate ex-
amples of their dogmatic obsession
come to mind. Upon Richard Nixon’s
visit to W&L in January, a group of
anti-Vietnam protestors distributed a
mimeographed sheet which epitomized
“liberal” intolerance. With an atti-

Klaus Eder Defended By ?

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

I found it truly amazing to hear
people call Klaus Eder a radical be-
cause of his “way-out” views as ex-
pressed in the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
(March 5),

He is not too far from the truth
when he calls our campus a “grave-
yard.” The W&L student seems in-
capable of much deep thought as the
level of conversation around here
never get above the subjects of dates,
parties and cars. The W&L student
accepts this school, society and the
world as it has always existed. There
is no doubting of past ideals; every-
thing from the past that is with us
today is passively accepted.

I think Mr. Eder makes a mistake
when he describes conservatism as an
excuse for non-existent political views.
Conservatism as an excuse only exists
in the South and to a larger degree
at W&L. Though the W&L student
is interested in politics, he does not
get deeply involved in the contro-
versies of the day. As a matter of fact,
the W&L man avoids the social,
economic and religious controversies
of the day,

This is due to a large extent to the
fact that the Southerner as seen at
WAL is for the most part a narrow-
minded, domineering, simple-minded,
outspoken supporter of conservatism.
When a W&L student gets hold of an
idea he doesn’t let go, so there is no
room for debate. The main problem
though, is that most of the students
don’t care much about the revolu-
tionary movements that are so stimu-
lating the campuses around the na-
tion.

That this school is dominated by
an archaic, unsophisticated fraternity
system is more than apparent. The
system as it presently exists thrives
on animalism, non-involvement and
anti-intellectualism. Our conservative
Southerner is incapable of tolerating
anyone who is liberal, creative, artistic
or philosophical. Quite simply, it
would appear that the W&L student
has not heard about the Christian
principles of toleration, understand-
ing and forgiveness so basic to our
Western society.

As a matter of self-preservation, I
shall decline to sign this letter.

not pair his moral integrity with
risk and with any thought of initiative.

Mr. Harsh was a pathetically frank
and honest man who could inspire
work out of the laziest of mortals.
He and Mr. C.A.N. Meadow were
often termed the radicals that really
desired to leave the old, staid ways
of the past. He often ignored Lewot's
restrictions on the use of city prop-
erty, and once Harsh was actually
caught with two pencils in his pos-
sion. Harsh’s evil ways sadly caught
the admiration of the respect of those
that worked with him in the clinic
and in the town waterworks.

The final figure in our narrative is
the young Mr. Davis who is the
General Assistant to Mr. Meadow,
Davis is another man who seems to
be constantly trying to undermine the
wholesome qualities of the status quo
using the obviously false criterion of
reason, Davis with Harsh and Meadow
form an insidious conspiracy which
is patently seeking to improve the
status quo which everyone knows can
not be improved. It is sad that these

Can Cute Catie Cut It?

By RIC BERARD

Unbeknownst to many of us at
Wal that the best “jock” this

to is the sister of Billy Ball, a Miss
Catie Ball. Although only 16 years
old, this gal holds five world records

say, she will be competing for the
United States in the Olympic games

the professors were staunchly con-
servative they had to go. This narrow-
mindedness has crippled the reputa-
tion, but it is now purged of wicked
conservatives.

Simple Minded?

And a final instance of “intoler-
ance” is no better exemplified than
by the letter which appears elsewhere
on this page. Mr. Eder was rather
subjective in his statements, but the
unidentified letter-writer is ridiculous.
His remarks about “simple-minded
Southerners” are not worth comment
and his point that W&L students are
not “involved” is wrong.

Involvement does not mean placard-
carrying as he must believe.

fhe political involment is already
overwhelmingly obvious, but there is
other activity. Even church attendance

is unrealistic, too, It’s pretty hard to
project this to an audience.
R-t Phi: Do you think a longer re-
hearsal period would have helped?
Baker: Yes, it would have. I could
have used the first two weeks to work
on style and gestures alone, and then
1 could have begun work on the
script.
R-t Phi: Turning to directing in gen-
eral, what do you think the purpose
of a director is?
Baker: He's got to make his actors
achieve certain effects to underscore
the playwrigt’s meaning. In “Country
Wife.” I've tried to show the differ-
ence between the affected world of the
stage and the real world off the stage
An example of this is when a red-
leg [a “bit part” actor who moves
scenery during scene changes] comes
on stage, he forgets his line and all
the actors on stage are frozen into
various affected positions. Then, in
other situations, I've tried to under-
score the playwright’s purpose through
blocking techniques. | guess if you
had to sum it up, a director's got to
sell the play.
R-t Phi: Well, Don, where do you
plan to go from here? Do you want
to continue working in drama?
Baker: | have no idea. It’s question

Current Troubadour Production

‘Country Wife’ Is A Handbook

By KIRK WOODWARD

University theater becomes more
and more radical. Yale does a play
on Vietnam. Hollins stages Albee.
Now the Troubadours are presenting
a topical play, “The Country Wife,”
by Mr. Wycherly. Topical? Try think-
ing of it as a handbook.

Say you want to sleep with as
many women as possible, as Horner
does. You have two main obstacles:
husbands and logistics. The women
themselves aren't obstacles. However,
they need a good opportunity.

Study the weaknesses of your op-
ponents. Often they will do the work
for you. If a man like Pinchwife
marries an ignorant girl from the
country (Margery), hoping she won't
have brains enough to cuckold him,
His compulsion for security may end
up driving her out of the house.
Wait. Remember also that ignorance

Would you believe that he will now
give a poetry reading?

He is George Garrett, professor of
English at Hollins College, who will
read from his poems and converse
with students in an appearance at
#:00 pm. Thursday (March 19) at
the Washingion and Lee University
Hook Store

\ prolific author, Garrett has writ-
number of books of

His latest works include a book of

“Por A Bitter Season’; a

novel, “Do, Lord, Remember Me"; a}

book of short stories, “Cold Ground

is not the same as virtue. The girl
may think you are a decent person
it she doesn't know any better.

Sometimes a husband may be hard-
er to fool. In that case, let everyone
hear that you just became impotent.

Now here is a practical exercise
on the principles you just learned. The
woman you (Harcourt) want, named
Alithea, is engaged to a man, Spark-
ish, who needs approval from other
men. What do you do? Solution,
next paragraph.

Solution: congratulate him on his
lack of jealousy. He'll be so anxious
to keep your good opinion that he'll
give you the woman with his own
hands.

Now apply these ideas yourself
You will see why the play is topical,
Sexual competition requires strategy
now as then, People still fool easily
Women are still the means to an
end—aren't they?

The play is funny, but people may
react to it in different ways. Watch

the audience leave the theater. Most
will smile and look pleased. (Don

Gorden Hitchen
To Lead § tudy

Gordon Hitchens, an authority on
modern films, will lead a seminar on
“The American Avant Garde and
Independent Film” Monday. Spon-
sored by the Department of Journ-
alism and Communications, the semi-
nar will consist of the analysis and
screening of typical avant garde films.

The seminar will cover in three

candidates,* ———

 

sessions the new wave of experimental
film-making. Although the morning

and afternoon sessions are restricted |

to students and former students of
motion pictures in the Journalism
School, the evening program is open
to the public. It will be held in Room
203, Reid Hall at 7:30.

The first session will feature an
analysis of the aims and content of
the new pictures. In the afternoon
and evening Hitchins will comment
on several films as they are shown.
Students will have a chance to meet
Hitchins informally between sessions
to discuss difficulties in film-making.

Hitchens is editor of “Film Com-
ment,” one of the leading periodicals
in the field of motion picture produc-

 

tion. He is also an assistant progressor |

in the Communication Arts Depart-
ment of the New York Institute of
Technology and film instructor at the
School of Visual Arts of the Horace
Mann School in New York.

According to Bill Timmerman, the
“non-leader” of the Student organiza-
tion, “This is a vigil . . . its purpose
is not primarily to win ‘converts’ but
to encourage others to reflect upon the

The Right And The Left

Conservative, n. A statesman who is enamored of exist-
ing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to
replace them with others.

—Ambrose Bierce

Many have said that conservatives oppose change. This
is absolutely untrue. They would not oppose a change to
more conservatism .... A liberal is much like a maiden
aunt. Always so interested in other people’s affairs and
wanting so much to help.

—Ring-tum Phi
Columnist, 1966
* * *

We highly recommend the above definitions to the atten-
tion of our readers. At W&L, not to know the meaning of
“conservative” and “liberal” may leave you hopelessly out of
the action in any discussion of What’s Wrong With Us. The
very words breathe battle on this campus.

“Conservative,” for example, raises visions of choking
neckties and choking indifference, grimaces of greeting on the
colonnade, and happy hedonism, starched shirts, and starched
minds; all vaguely attached to simple-minded Southerners.
If you happen to be of a political turn of mind, “conservative”
hints at hawkishness and humbug.

“Liberal,” of course, summons up a spectre with flowing
locks, turtleneck, and truly unbearable arrogance, spouting
warmed-over intellectuality through aggressively bearded lips.
Politically, liberals are better-red-than-dead doves with no re-
spect for constituted authority.

We were overjoyed, therefore, to observe that the last
few issue of both editions of the Ring-tum Phi have been filled
with the cries of conservatives and liberals, treating us to de-
lightfully doctrinaire broadsides from the Left (“Our con-
servative Southerner is incapable of tolerating anyone who is
liberal, creative, artistic, or philosophical”) and from the Right
(Anti-Conservative Students Reveal Personal Intolerance’’) .
And since Spring traditionally brings out the activist in many
an otherwise mild-mannered student, we have room to hope
that the verbal barrage will continue.

We could wish, however, that the spectacle was as mean-
ingful as it is entertaining. While the epithets “liberal” and
“conservative” fly, it seems to have occurred to no one that
real liberals and conservatives are as rare at W&L as they
are everywhere else, and that the vast majority of people who
find themselves classified as one or the other here really don’t
want or deserve either label. The real fact is that students
here have “liberal” ideas about some things and “conservative”
ideas about others; and by no means is everyone “liberal” or
“conservative” about the same things.

You’d never know it, or hear the armed camps talk. As
if every day and every trifling issue has brought us to the
Last Judgement, we have fallen into the habit of casting one
another into eternal damnation or salvation on the right or
left. In order to do this, we’ve evolved a truly marvelous yard-
stick. Coats and ties are “conservative.” Bushy beards are
“liberal.” Intellectualism is strictly liberal. Anti-intellectualism
is confined to conservatives. Southerners are conservative (So
we must also assume everyone else is liberal) . Fraternity parties
are downright reactionary, while sit-ins are hopelessly radical.
Conservatives like things to stay the way they are. Ninety-eight
per cent of the student body favors the coat and tie tradition.
Therefore, the campus is crawling with conservatives. Liberals
like to change things. Every student who wants exams before
Christmas, a freer exam schedule, no Saturday classes, more
liberal academic requirements, girls in dorms, better dorms,

better entertainment facilities, a better gym, a better theater, |

etc., etc., is a liberal. Therefore, the campus is crawling with

liberals. Q.E.D.

Can a more ridiculous edifice of cliche-ridden prejudices
be found anywhere? Hardly. Whatever value the terms “‘lib-
eral’ and “conservative” once had on this campus (and it
must have been small from the start), it has long since dis-
appeared, Everyday human idiosyncrasy simply defies the
clumsy liberal-conservative categories we seem to love so much

here.

Conflict and criticism are basic to progress, to be sure,
and they deserve their place in campus life—but please, let’s
here no more about liberals and conservatives.

Twelve nominees and six ballots...

 

By PAT AREY

“With these twelve candidates in
the field, there is still a possibility
that some dark horse will be nomi-
nated...”

So opened the official convention
journal of the first Mock Republican
Convention held at W&L. In 1916,
twelve persons were nominated be-
fore a convention that would run
for six ballots, and nearly be wrong
for the second time.

The prominent candidates for the
nomination were former President
Theodore Roosevelt, Supreme Court
Justice Charles Evans Hughes, and
Elihu Root of New York. The fav-
orite sons included Charles Fairbanks
of Indiana, Robert M. LaFollette,
Sen. L. Y. Sherman of Illinois, Sen.
William Borah of Idaho, Sen, Albert
Cummins of lowa, Sen. John Weeks
of Massachussetts, Gov. Hadley of
Missouri and Theodore Burton of
Ohio.

The GOP even had its peace candi-
date that year, Henry Ford of Detroit.

Sen. Weeks led the pre-convention
favorite sons. His banner was hung
over the commons and enthusiasm
for the senator culminated in an
“outburst” in the Lyric Theatre.

LaFollette was being pushed by
members of the Law School and the
author’s grandfather under the slogan
“Progressive but not radical.”

 

Charles Evans Hughes
“Wilson rose from the dead...”

Right With Hughes

 

“At the Lees Dormitory,” reported
the convention journal “the sonorous
battle cry ‘Root for Root’ has been
sounded, even at late hours of the
night.”

“Grape Juice Followers”

The two major platform issues of ki
the year were woman suffrage and
national prohibition of demon rum.
The Alabama delegation was report-
ed “Inclined to scoff at the idea of
national prohibition.”

Kentucky, on the other hand, was
reported ten to one opposed to giv-
ing the vote to the weaker sex. Said
the delegation’s banner: “Kentucky.
Good Liquor Needs No Prohibition.
Pretty Girls Don’t Care To Vote.”

Needless to say, the suffrage plank
was stricken from the platform. “Na-
tional prohibition did not even get as
much consideration . . . the grape
juice followers got a scanty vote.”

Much in the spirit of the conven-
tion, the Arizona delegation staged a
“mock” fracas for the sergeant-at-
arms.

The first ballot held no surprises.
No one came close to leading in the
ballot, with 87 votes for Root, and
75 for Hughes. Other votes were
Weeks, 47; Roosevelt, 41; Borah, 37;
LaFollette, 30; Cummins, 29; Sher-
man, 26; Fairbanks, 24; Burton, 20;
and Tender, 1.

On the second ballot, Sen. Cum-
mins came to the front with 133 votes,
far ahead of Root, who fell to 76.
Hughes had 70 votes; Roosevelt, 66;
Weeks, 44; LaFollette, 21; Borah, 15;
and peace candidate Ford, 11.

LaFollette Doublecrossed

the Root and LaFollette forces made
a deal. LaFollette’s votes to Root on

12 votes, then none when the Root
forces refused to deliver the promised
support. Burton held with three votes,
and the second ballot leader was left
with one lone supporter of a previous
133.

After some rather frantic backroom
dealing and bickering, Ohio’s Burton
enjoyed a brief moment of glory,
jumping from a mere three en-
thusiasts to 154 votes. Hughes, how-
ever, kept his fat lead of 175 votes.
Root held only 92 votes, Roosevelt
dipped to 38, and Sen. Borah fol-
lowed the lead of Sen. Cummins to
inglorious oblivion, despite one lonely
stalwart supporter, Needless to say,
“Fighting Bob” LaFollette had had
the screws put to him.

The fifth ballot nearly saw a Roose-
velt sweep. States began to shift
to T. R., but not quite enough;
he was stopped some 30 votes short
of the nomination,

Roosevelt had captured 196 dele-
gates; Root had jumped to 181, and
Justice Hughes was left with a paltry
40 votes.

 

In 1916 Convention

“This slump by Hughes was a mere
lull preceding that proverbial storm,”
said the convention journal.

On the sixth and final ballot, the
race resolved into fiight between
Hughes and Roosevelt.

On the roll call, Alabama opened
for Roosevelt, Arizona then cast its
three votes for Hughes. Arkansas, in
turn, went for the Man With a Big
Stick. But then followed a solid string
of votes for Hughes, with a few inter-
jections for T. R.

The sixth ballot declared Hughes
the nominee, with 309 votes against
Roosevelt’s 157.

Wasting no time, the convention
endorsed without opposition Sen.
Miles Poindexter of Washington for
vice president. Poindexter, true to
W&L tradition and spirit, was an
alumnus of the college.

Once again, W&L correctly forecast
the nominee of the real national con-
vention. And the GOP went on to
grasp defeat from the jaws of victory
that November.

The third ballot saw a boom for
Sen. Borah. The Idaho senator's votes

moved up to 92 votes; Roosevelt de-

clined to 56; LaFollette was left with By BOS ENTZMINGER

Freshman E, C, Representative

Last week, on the basis of inter-
views | had held with over 100 fresh-
men, I presented my classmates’ opin-
ions concerning Washington and Lee’s
traditons and its system of operation.
This week, I shall attempt to give the
freshman views on certain specific
features of the W&L campus which
are now in existence or may be in
existence in the near future. Although
it is impossible to give completely the
opinion of every individual inter-
viewed, I feel that the most emphasiz-
ed ideas are indicative of the feeling
of the majority o fthe freshmen.

Q. Do you think our library is
adequate?
Yes No

Of those who answered “no” to the
above question, a large percentage
cited examples of times when they
had not been able to obtain necessary
material in our library. When asked,

dates for the Republican Presidential
nomination seem to be divisible into
two groups: Richard Nixon, and the
rest.

Just hours before the results of the
New Hampshire primary had confirm-
ed this categorization on the national
level, activities of various Mock Con-
vention campaign committees had
established that impression here.

The Nixon forces, with law student
Chip Day in charge, had planned a

reply, meaning more new books and
a more diversified selection of books
on various subjects. The difficulty of
acquiring adequate research books
when preparing a theme or paper had
already been experienced by some
freshmen.

Longer hours for studying in the
library was another suggestion off-
ered. Many people would like to see
the library opened earlier on Sunday,
either early in the afternoon or late
in the morning. Also, it was the
opinion of many that the library
should remain open longer at night
during exam period. Students felt that
there was not enough space in class-
rooms and other libraries on campus
for those who wished to study past
library closing hours.

Some type of orientation to the
library besides the written explanation
passed out in English classes was the
request of many freshmen, Some did
not know what study areas were
available in different parts of the
library or where some of the books
were located. A brief tour of the
library for freshmen was suggested
as a solution to this problem.

The next question asked included

the primary and appeared confident
enough to enjoy the festivities as
much as those who came more for
the beer than to identify themselves
with Nixon's expected triumph in
New Hampshire.

But of Day's staff of 10—including
Al Byrne, Joe Brown, Hank Grad-
dy, and Chris Chandor—those who
were present revealed at closer inspec-
tion the ease and coolness of those
who have mastered the organization-
al aspects of campaigning and are now
free to concentrate on strategy, rather
than the joy of complete abandon,
Although the large number of law
students present perhaps lended to
the illusion that these men are ma-
ture, collected, and to some extent
seasoned, the facts of their campaign
to date seem to confirm this convic-
tion,

Financially, they are sound at pres-
ent, but Day says he is asking for

more donations from state delega-
tions which support Nixon. Nixon or-
organizations elsewhere are also con-
tributing, but more funds will be
needed. Even though they are going
through the pre-convention motions
(they opened a headquarters Wednes-
day), they are already forming
strategy for the Mock Convention
proper (planning their own platform
proposal, demonstrations, and a nom-
inating speech). It is clear that they
intend to be discreet, hoping to keep
delegates aware of Nixon, but stop-
ping far short of the saturation
point. As Day puts it, “Right now, we
just want to make sure the delega-
tions vote as they should.”

Of those classed as “others,” Gov.
Nelson Rockfeller seems to be the
front-runner, even if his showing in
New Hampshire is not encouraging.
His campaign committee here, hamp-
ered by his refusal to announce, ex-
hibits something of the same im-
promptu organization as its counter-
part in New Hampshire. Headed by
Pat Arey, they are working hard to
overcome Nixon's lead in the mind of
the WAL student by a variety of
posters and informational materials.
Yet lack of funds (there was some
jealous muttering about the amount
of money raised by Reagan sup-
porters) and the opinion that they
should do nothing more than “be
ready” in case Rockefeller decides
to act like the candidate everybody
says he is has confined their scope
of action to the immediate future.
But they are hoping, and from their
bare room above Rose's Store they
dash in and out, planning polls to
test public sentiment in the coming
weeks. That one must remain flexible,
however, is a prime political axiom,
That they realize that need is at-
tested to by a Eugene McCarthy pos-
ter which is covering the peeling
paint along one wall,

If Sen. Charles Percy of Hlinois is
more adamant than Rockefeller in
his non-candidacy (“I'm running for
nothing”), at least his advocates here
are more organized, And if the size
of their office (embarrassingly close

| to that of Rockefeller’s forces) is any

indication, they are in a substaniial-
ly higher income bracket, too

Jeff Wainscott is the head, has been

Moreover, they are looking for-

Friday Sports Columnist

This time of year, every sports
columnist worth his salt is predict-
ing either the upcoming pennant races
or the basketball tournaments of the
next two weekends. Jumping boldly
on the bandwagon, “Thunder's Theor-
ies” will examine the NCAA regionals
in an attempt to raise my percentage
in the risky world of prognostication.

The regionals this year seem to
indicate clear-cut winners in three of
the four sections. The only one of the
four that raises any doubt is the
Eastern region, which should be the
most interesting of the four.

Lions and Wildcats

In the East, Columbia (22-4), the
Ivy League victor, will square off
against Southern Conference king
Davidson (23-4). Columbia has three
solid performers in seven-footer Dave
Newmark, Heyward Dotson, and Jim
McMillan. All can score in the twen-
ties, and they won a big one over
a good Princeton club to get into
the tournament.

However, there is one big ques-
tion; Newmark is suffering from an
injury that will cut his ability to
handle Davidson’s big Mike Maloy.
In addition, the Wildcats’ strong
backcourt of Wayne Huckel and
Dave Moser, plus Rodney Knowles,
a strong substitute who might be
called on to give Newmark some op-
position under the boards, gains my
nod to the North Carolinians.

Bonnies and Tarheels

The second game of this region
should be one of the biggest of the
tournament, as North Carolina will
meet undefeated St. Bonaventure and
its two siege guns, Bob Lanier and
Bill Butler.

I think the Tarheels have a couple
of things going for them that should
net them a victory. Number one, or
course,, is Larry Miller, who will
help not only because he is an out-
standing star in his own right, but
because he wants to go out a winner,
and when a man of his stature tells
his teammates to win, few will dis-
pute his words. His inspiration should
prod big Rusty Clark to an adequate
effort against Lanier, and that battle
should go a long way to deciding a
winner. The difference should be that
Clark will have the help of four
tourney-wise teammates who operate
as a well-tuned machine with Mr.
Miller at the controls. It looks like the
Tarheels in a close one.

In the final, a Davidson-UNC game
would be equal to the Tarheel-St.
Bonaventure encounter for exicite-
ment. On the other hand, Columbia

again because of the fact that David-

Miller, while Clark’s height advant-
age might slow down the Wildcat star,

‘Cats ’n Cougars

In the other regions, Kentucky
looks like a shoo-in in the Mideast
with their only trouble coming from
Marquette. Coach Adolph Rupp’s
super-stable of sophomores Casey,
Pratt, and Issel should be more than
enough.

In the Midwest, it’s the Cougars of
Houston in a breeze, although some
would point to Louisville with the
upset in mind. The Kentuckians
though need an Indian to keep their
chiefs like Wes Unseld, Butch Beard,
and Mike Grosso in line. Even with
George Reynolds out because of the
junior college inelibility rule, the Big
E should be up high enough for
another final. Either TCU or Kansas
State (with a total of 17 losses between
them) is no more than cannon
fodder.

On the coast, the Bruins of Johnny
Wooden feel they have a date with
destiny, and New Mexico State (22-5)
and New Mexico (23-3) should be
the victims.

For a closing shot, although for
the time being I see no reason to
extend my neck farther this week,
here’s a hint for followers of early
round NIT play: don't be surprised
if the number one seed, Duke, falls
before its date with the finals.

Fifteen Golfers Vie
For Team Positions

Five lettermen out of an aggrega-
tion of fifteen hopefuls are currently
battling for the ten spots on the 1968
edition of Cy Twombly’s Washington
and Lee golf team.

Practice opened this week for the
Generals on the Luxurious Lexing-
ton Links, which, according to
Twombly, are not in their finest
condition (as if many things in this
fair city ever are). Practice scores
have been high, but Twombly says
he expects them to begin dropping
once the course starts shaping up.

Returning Strength

Captain Bob Mathews leads the
returning lettermen, a group com-
posed of himself, juniors Bill McLeod
and Gary Silverfield, and sophomores
Dick Singletary and Dave Parker.
Mathews, McLeod, and Singletary
have posted the lowest pratice scores
so far, but the Richmond captain has
been hampered somewhat by a bad
back. “If his back improves,” Twomb-
ly commented, “he should have a
fine season.”

Rounding out the list of prospects
for what Twombly said should be
a “well balanced” squad are fresh-
men Ken Carter, John Gunner, John
Bowie, and Jim Gordon; junior Tom

Lacrosse For The § pectator

Lacrosse is one of the few sports native to North America and
one of the oldest intercollegiate sports in the United States. The game
was discovered by missionaries among the Canadian Indians, and was
developed in the United States mainly on the East coast in the Maryland
area. But now the popularity of the game is spreading and teams
and leagues are being formed all the way to the West coast.

Basically, a lacrosse team is composed of ten players: 3 attack-
men, 3 defensemen, 3 midfielders, and a goalie. The game is played
on a field 110 yards long and from 60 to 70 yards wide. The goals are
80 yards apart and are located in a ten-foot diameter circle called the
crease. No offensive player is allowed to enter the crease or to interere
with the goalie while he has posssession of the ball in the crease.

The field is divided in half by the midfield line, and each half is
split by a restraining line. These restraining lines are used only when
the ball is put in play, or faced off, after each goal or at the beginning
of each quarter. At this time the attack and defensive players on each
half of the field must stay behind their respective restraining lines
until a midfielder gains possession of the ball, or until the ball crosses
their restraining line.

At all times each team must have three attackmen and four
defensemen on their respective sides of the midfield lines. The mid-
fielders, however, are permitted to cover any part of the field, and
may release an attackman or defenseman by remaining on that player's
half of the field.

The game is played by controlling the hard rubber ball in the
net of a stick and moving the play of the game either by running with
the ball or passing it to another player. The goalie is the only player
allowed to touch the ball with his hands, but any player may kick the
ball.

A goal is scored when the attacking team gets the ball into the
six foot square “cage.” This is accomplished with basic plays and
variations similar to basketball, that is cutting and picking a man off
or a One-on-one situation.

Blocking and checking are also permitted, with the blocking rules
much the same as those in football. A player is not allowed to block
an Opponent unless that player has control of the ball or he is within
five yards of the ball when it is not controlled by another player. A
blocking player must have both hands on his stick and may not block
the player from behind or below the knees.

A check is delivered with the stick itself, and is used to dislodge
the ball from another player's stick or to prevent another player from
gaining possession of the ball. Only the stick or gloves of an opponent
may be checked, but sometimes the action gets out of hand with some
brutal results, which is one reason for the growing spectator appeal
among the sadistic thrill seekers around the country.

For infractions of the rules a player is asked to sit in the penalty
box, 30 seconds for a technical foul, 60 seconds for a personal foul,
and up to three minutes for the more serious infractions. The player
is allowed to return to the field when a goal is scored against his
team or when his penalty is expired. Until that time his team must
play a man down.

The most common technical fouls are off sides, a moving pick, or
being in the crease. Personal fouls are charged for illegal checks, block-
ing from behind, tripping, or bad-mouthing the ref

In all lacrosse is a combination of many athletic talents such as
found in football, basketball, soccer, and ice hockey, and with that
mixture One comes out with the fastest game on two feet, lacrosse.

« Neer Holds Attention

As Tracksters Prep

By ROY CARLTON

Next Tuesday at 3:45, the Wash-
ington and Lee track team will open
its season against Richmond, here on
Wilson Field. While the meet should
be interesting of its own account, it
will also mark the debut of W&L’s
Mike Neer as a trackman.

Records May Fall

Coach Lee McLaughlin is enthusi-
astic about Neer’s potential and has
called him “the first really quality
trackman we've had here in a long
time.” He’s almost certain of break-
ing the school record in the high
jump.” The record was set in 1963
by R. A. Kell at 61”, but Neer has
already jumped 64” in an indoor
meet and has been jumping 66” in
practice. Not only is he an excellent
high jumper, but he’s also a fine
triple jumper with a solid chance of
breaking the school record in that

event,
x

This year’s team has its main
strength in the distance events. Bob
Stack is the number one miler, but
he’s a doubtful prospect for Tuesday's
meet, due to a bout with the flu.
Backing him up is Harry Zeliff. Cor-
bett Bryant also looks good in the
two-mile event. Earl Edwards has
been coming along very well also, and

may be able to dent the school’s mile
record toward the end of the season.

Phil Norwood, this year‘s captain,
is the team’s best sprinter and will
probably anchor the 440 relay team,
as he’s the only returning member of
last year’s unit.

How do we react to this play, aside
from laughing? Partly we like seeing
knavery without participating in it.

Partly also, we normally like being
knaves without thinking much about
it. The play offers a pleasant change
from this routine.

We also like the shock of recogni-
tion — seeing on stage our sexual
dream world.

(as nice a euphemism as was ever
studied in freshman English).

The statement that, “Those who
successfully complete the program
will have a better understanding of
what the Army is all about [suggest-
ing we do not know already] and an
increased capability of handling prob-
lems that arise both inside and out-
side the Army,” implies that the type
of training the Army provides will
even help people better understand
themselves and society. This is a nice
statement of the goals of a small
liberal arts university, but rings slight-
ly flat when set up as the objective
of a Ranger program.

I feel it necessary to maintain an
army in “modern society” (if that
is not a euphemism also). However,
if a “peacetime army,” such as the
military technically is in our present
state of undeclared war, is so readily
available for such field exercises as
those currently being conducted in
Southeast Asia, | have to ask why we
need Ranger programs to occupy the
time of undergraduates.

It is possible of course, that the
U.S. is “waging peace” (Hubert Hum-
phrey) in Vietnam. In that case, I
can understand why a dinner dance
with presentation of black beret,
ranger tags, and a Ranger trophy is
a refined and gentlemanly conclusion
to training which “will vary from
bayonet training and guerrilla war-
fare to first aid and survival train-
ing.”

My only question is why not have
a special Ranger decoder ring with
secret compartment?

the proposed sight of the event, was
nil.

Probably the most unexpected
participant in the vigil was the chap-
lain from neighboring V.M.I. Ob-
serving the demonstration in “non-
official capacity,” the Chaplain, a
naval officer, stated that the military's
function was to implement the wishes
of the State Department and the
Chief Executive. As they were the
representatives of the people of the
United States, he continued, there was
very definitely a place for demonstra-
tion on the American scene.

flying at half-mast in memorial to

The success of this first demonstra-
tion led Timmerman to say that
there would be another at the same
time next Friday afternoon, again in
front of the Commons.

 

Biology Speaker

Dr. Donald M. Ross, Dean of
Science at the University of Alberta
in Edmondton, Canada, will speak on
“Marriage and Divorce Among the
Sea Anemones” Monday, March 18,
at 5S p.m. The talk will be in New
Science 305.

Besides his talk, Dr. Ross will show

 

emotions. Today at VMI the flags are

in apartments and fraternity houses
after their freshman year. The advent
of the residential college idea would
seemingly weaken the fraternity sys-
tem here and that possibility aroused
the opposition of a number of fresh-
men,

Q. Would you favor compulsory
dorms for anyone other than fresh-
men?

Yes Ne
Il per cent 89 per-cent

The main objection again was the
loss of the option of the student to
live where he wished, However, most
freshmen felt that new dorms should
be built if the present ones aren't
able to accommodate those upperclass-
men wishing to live in them.

The following question was the sub-
ject of much discussion among those
interviewed and the responses given
are noteworthy,

Q. Of the buildings which need

to be constructed on campus, which
do you think should be given first
preference? Which should be given
second preference?
This question was asked on the sup-
position that construction on the new
student union building had not been
started. Therefore, a new student
union building could be included in
this answer,

First prefernce:

Gymnasium 48 per cent
Auditorium 28 per cent
Library 17 per cent
Student Union 7 per cent
Second preference:

Auditorium 36 per cent
Gymnasium 33 per cent
Library 28 per cent
Student Union 2 per cent

New Dorms I per cent

The idea of a field-house, which
could serve as both a gymnasium and
auditorium, was suggested by several
freshmen. It seems significant that the
great majority of freshmen felt that
a new gym, new auditorium, or new
library should have preference over
a new student union, The problem
with the construction of any of these
buildings is the raising of funds, which
freshmen are aware of, as | mentioned
last week, Most students felt that
the money could be raised, however,
if given a sustained effort by the ad-
ministration

color films of his research.

What The Class Of 1971 Is Thinking

Yes No
41 per cent 59 per cent

Opinion on this question was very
split, with the “yes” voters arguing
that the money spent on subsidization
would be worth the prestige that the
school would receive in return, while
the “no” voters felt that subsidization
would lower the academic standards
of the school and would be a waste of
money. Most of those who were in
favor of subsidization thought that
basketball should be the sport sub-
sidized with the others favoring foot-
ball.

This completes my report on the
results of my interviews with my fel-
low freshmen. Is is very difficult to
combine the thoughts that were ex-
pressed during these sessions into one
specific mode of thinking. However,
one general attitude does seem pre-
valent. Freshmen are very strongly in
favor of the conservation of certain
traditions here at WAL. They feel
that these traditions are invaluable.
However, they would rather see our
campus characterized by an air of
progressiveness than by the stench of
stagnation. They realize that nothing
can live on its past reputation, its past
fame. Instead, everything must be
judged on what it is doing in the
present, Any significant advancement
brought about on this campus can-
not be accomplished by one man, one
committee, or one Organization. More-
over, it must be done through the
combined effort of all those involved.
Only through constant concern and
self-examination can we be sure that
the path we are following is not one
of indifferent retrogression but instead,
one of sound progress.

wait for the final decision of their
candidate.

Only Nixon’s supporters are in a
position which might be called favor-
able, and they appear ready to utilize
that position both skillfully and with
discretion. That the other commit-
tees recognize Nixon’s enviable posi-
tion and their own similarities is
shown by the interchange of person-
nel among these groups. This inter-
change may reflect a growing need
for compromise in the convention, (a
compromise which may be develop-
ing nationally, too) and that need
may produce a more equitable, and
perhaps very different, vote distribu-
tion than occurred in the New Hamp-
shire primary.

however, the team’s best strength lies
in the shotput, where the Generals are
blessed with an over-abundance of
good material. Phil Jones returns this
year to take a crack at the school

by a pair of excellent freshmen in

Field, but may have to be played
on the intramural field where the
club now practices.

The problem may be solved by the
acquisition of playing rights on a field
near the Buffalo Creek Pavilion. That
is the spot which the club hopes to
use for the Springs Weekend tourna-
ment and the remainder of its home
games. Unlike fields on the W&L
campus, this one has no restrictions
regading that integral part of any
rugby match, the keg party after the
game.

Earns Respect

Despite its somewhat meager status
around Washington and Lee, the club
is well respected in area rugby circles.
This is evidenced by the many re-
quests its receives to enter tourna-
ments and play other clubs. Un-
fortunately, due to the lack of funds,
the club is limited in regard to its
travel budget. Hopefully, with the help
of donations from the merchants and
students that comprise the unfficial
“Friends of the Rugby Club,” the
organization will be able to surmount
its financial problems and become a
set part of the University.

secutive annual joint venture of the
Lexingion Kiwanis Club and the
FROGS. The series began with “HMS
Pinafore” in 1964 and has successively
included “lolanthe,” “Pirates of Penz-
ance” and “The Mikado,”

Unpaid Performers

The participants in the show and
orchestra have loosely organized them-
selves into the FROGS to provide
for continuity of planning for future
productions. Nobody in the cast,
chorus or orchestra is paid. The entire
show is a voluntary effort springing
from interest in the community and
a particular fondness for Gilbert and
Sullivan.

The Kiwanis Club supplies man-
power for many support committees:
finances the heavy initial outlays for
scores, orchestra parts and costume
rental: solicits advertising support,
and sells the bulk of the tickets. All
proceeds from the show after ex-
penses support the Lexington Kiwanis
Club's Sholarship Fund for area high
school graduates.

Community Cooperates

As in the past, this year's show is
an excellent example of community
cooperation. Professor Joseph  B.
Thompson, the producer, is a psycho-
logy professor at WAL; Lee Kahn,
the director, is also on the faculty
WAL and is the mentor of the
lroubadours: Mrs. Royster Lyle, co-
director, serves on the faculty at
Southern Seminary; Col. Bierly, the
conductor, is a faculty member at
VMI: Mrs. Tyson Wilson, the chorus
master, is the director of a local
church choir; and David Hall, another
WAL. faculty member, has done the
set design

The principal roles are being sung
by residents of Buena Vista, Lexine

Southern Collegian Second
Edition To Appear Today
With Article On The Draft

The second edition of the South-
ern Collegian appeared today, featur-
ing an article on the draft by Con-
gressman Bill Brock of Tennessee, a
Washingion and Lee alumnus. In the
article, Brock raises the question of
an all-volunteer Army.

The third edition of the Collegian
is set to appear the week of April
9th, with an article by Strom Thur-
mond. The fourth edition will be de-
voted to the Mock Convention and
should be ready for distribution at
that time.

When asked about the financial
position of the Collegian, editor-pub
lisher Steve Saunders said, “We'll
probably lose money.” Saunders went
on to say, “Our object last year was
to preserve the magazine.” The South-
ern Collegian was founded in 1868
at Washington and Lee, making it
the oldest collegiate magazine in the
South.

The Collegian has applied for a
corporation charter in Virginia, and
plans to become part of the Com
munity Press, Inc. of Culpeper, the

Last night the Executive Committee
decided to replace Lane Steinger as
head of the Curriculum Committee.
The action was the result of the
failure of the committee to produce
a report On its activities after a num-
ber of requests by the EC,

[he proposal to remove Steinger
was passed unanimously by the EC.
Applications will be accepted for the
rest of this week from students who
would be interested in serving as
chairman of the Curriculum Commit-
tee.

SCC Fines

In other actions, fines were added
to the list of possible alternatives by
the Student Control Committee on
students who are rowdy in public
during the Mock Convention parade.

 

SEE NOTICE BELOW
ee

The idea was proposed by Steve
Saunders to serve as a means of con-
trolling those students who would be
unphased by conduct and social proba-
tion ‘because of the nearness of the
Convention to graduation and the
end of the academic year.

Peter Kintz, chairman of the SCC,
said that the action might help to
keep the students under control and
that the committee would consider
both the size and instance of the fines
primarily on the individual cases that
might come up. He also stated that

Convention Fines

The Executive Committee of the
Student Body has given the Stu-
dent Control Committee special fin-
ing powers in addition to its regu-
lar disciplinary powers for the
weekend of the Mock Convention,
This has been done in an attempt
fo prevent any ungentlemanly con-
duct that may take place during
that weekend,

Under this system a violator may
be reported by one of the Mock
Convention “sergeants-at-arms.” A
violator will be subject to the usual
disciplinary action by the Student
Control Committee (conduct probo-
tion, social probation, denial of
participation in graduation § cere-
monies, etc.) and/or a fine.

would prevent their use being needed.
The EC also approved giving to the
Mock Convention $249.04 as the
balance on appropriations given in
past years to the Interim Coordinat-
ing Committee. The money is to be
used to pay outstanding bills left over
from the Interim Committee.
Richard Nash said that flowers had
been sent to Tom Baremore’s family
in the behalf of the student body and
that he had written a letter as well.

Honor System

Danny Leonard reported on the
possibility of sending to incoming
freshmen a brochure on the honor
system. This would possibly be in-
corporated in a letter from the presi-
dent of the student body. Action on
this was deferred until the possible
costs could be ascertained.

 

Poetry Reading
Set For Tonight

Professor George Garrett, author
and professor of English at Hollins
College, will conduct a poetry read-
ing in the Bookstore tonight at 8.
After the reading, Mr. Garrett will
engage in an informal conversation
period with his audience.

“Informal” is the word to describe
Professor Garrett's presentation, Mrs,
Betty Munger, manageress, plans to
have the bookshelves placed against
the walls and benches set up. Those
people attending the lecture may sit
on the benches or on the floor. Pro-
fessor Garrett will not only read
poetry but also, Mrs. Munger hopes,
excerpts from his forthcoming novel.
After the reading, Mr. Garrett will
lead an informal discussion on the
creative process. Free coffee will be
provided during the evening.

Before coming to Hollins, Mr. CGar-
rett had a varied career. He is a

 

native of Florida and was graduated

magna cum laude from Princeton
University. Far from having a strictly
academic career, Prof. Garrett has
been employed in such occupations as
bartender, truck driver, weightlifting
instructor, football coach, and mem-
ber of a geophysical team. He also
taught at Wesleyan, Rice, Princeton
and the University of Virginia prior
to assuming his post at Hollins

Versatile and prolific, Prof
rett has written several
poetry and short stories, three novels,
and a play. Among his most
works are a book of poems,

Goat
volumes of

recent

“For A

Bitter Season.” a collection of short
stories, “Cold Ground Was My Bed
Last Night.” a novel, “Do, Lord,
Remember Me,” and his play, “Sit
Slob and the Princes.”

Other works which he has pro
duced have earned Profesor Garrett

numerous awards and prizes

Gearrett has served as an edilor a

well as an author. Besides editing
several books, he has been poetry
editor of several magazines, including

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s ‘Twice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, March 19, 1968

 

A good friend
Tommy Mac Baremore will be missed. He was serious and
sincere; he had determination, based upon knowledgeability;
he had a fine sense of perspective, and a rare sense of humor.
Most of all, he possessed understanding. In no respect, at any
time, did he fail to serve his University well, to represent it
admirably. He brought much to Washington and Lee, and
left much to it.

We are not good at eulogizing. But we are profoundly
grateful to him. We shall miss him very, very much.

The Troubs: Yet another success

The Troubadours have done it again. Before last week, we
would have told you it was highly improbable that they could
ever equal the quality of last year’s electrifying ‘Marat/
Sade.” But “The Country-Wife,” which closed night before last
after an “extended run,” is as delightful as “Marat” was
terrifying; as entertaining as “Marat” was disturbing; as well
acted and staged as a Broadway play; and as much a credit to
the players, the director, and everybody else connected with
it as any play we have ever seen. Don Baker, the student di-
rector, is to be congratulated in particular for having suc-
cessfully maintained the masterful tradition established these
few years by permanent director Lee Kahn. We simply don’t
have at our command enough superlatives to describe ‘The
Country-Wife” (neither do we have enough anti-superlatives
to describe the Troubs’ “theatre’’-building, but this is sup-
posed to be a joyous editorial anyway . . .).

Observation and commentary

We've been reading our junk mail again. This week’s most
audacious request comes from a Denver publisher who’s put-
ting out a pamphlet and who thinks the Ring-tum Phi ought
to give him free publicity. The booklet is mimeographed
(not printed); it is 164 pages long. And the Ring-tum Phi
is expected to send three dollars by return mail for a review

copy.

 

It’s probably instructive to observe a large group of students
while they are watching Cronkite or Huntley-Brinkley. The
freshmen find it hilarious. The sophomores are amused and
entertained, though not quite so much. Juniors are noticeably
uneasy. And seniors panic.

Letter from the Editor

Allow us, if you will, to com-
ment on unsigned  letters4o-he-
editor. We published one last week,
and apparently some people took it as
a sign to begin cranking them out—
even if they are so very pointless and
inane as to leave no impression

 

The Ring4tum Phi hasn't (yet) re-
ceived The Word From On High. If
you don't like what we say, we won't
become irrational and seek your im-
mediate destruction. And there are
people in the world who send us
signed letters of criticism (see right,
for instance), so we know we're not

other than that somebody wants to
get into print (even if it’s only the
Ring-tum Phi).

The odds are very great indeed
that, upon receiving such anonymous
letters, we will laugh and throw them
away. We won't publish them indis-
criminately, and by their very na-
ture we probably won't publish them
diseriminately, either. Signed letters
are invariably published in one of
the two Editions, unless their con-
temt is such that publication would
bring us legal grief—and in that case,
we let the writer know, Unsigned
letters will be published only at the
Editor's exceedingly infrequent pleas-
ure

The Ring-tum

 

mad to expect more of them to be
signed. Editors of both Editions are,

by the way, able and willing to
keep identities confidential, if you
insist.

Finally, a point or two concerning
last week's unsigned letier. It was
perhaps the most outlandish,  ill-
reasoned tripe ever written by a stu-
dent at this University (assuming the
writer is, or was, a student), and it
was published exactly as we received
it, as a sort of Essay In Absurdity.
The writer said he felt compelled
to keep his identity a dark secret out
of an instinct for “self-preservation.”
Well, personally, we feel it was prob-

ably out of self-respect.

Dr. Leyburn Previews Latest
Production By The FROGS

By JAMES G. LEYBURN

Professor of Sociology and
Chief Resident Savoyard

The Gilbert and Sullivan addict,
like that fleshy poet Bunthorne, is
not fond of uttering platitudes in
stained-glass attitudes; but it is clear
to him that Gilbertian wit is unparal-
leled in its Victorian intellectuality,
and that Sullivan's music in the operas
is, quite simply, incomparable.

“Patience,” whose reincarnation
is this week to be witnessed in Lex-
ington, ranks very high in the canon
of the 13 operas. There are those
who claim that it is the perfect mar-
riage of deft satire and musical rail-
lery, of gay erudition and beguiling
melody. It is the third of the “P”
operas, following “Pinafore” and “The
Pirates of Penzance.”

Gilbert, having by now wielded his
Aristophanic scalpel upon the Royal
Navy, country curates, major-gener-
als, lawyers and juries, and other
diverting English fauna, turns his sar-
donic eye upon contemporary English
flora—upon the cult of aestheticism.

1880's Heyday

The 1880's were the heyday of
Oscar Wilde, Algernon Swinburne,
and James McNeill Whistler. Oscar
astounded the sedate middle-class by
lecturing in a flowered waistcoat, a
velvet jacket and knee-britches, while
dandling a languid lily in his mediaev-
al hand. Algernon’s idyllic and raptur-
ous poems, frequently incomprehen-
sible to those who swooned over
them, were quoted with appropriate
hand-waving at high teas and week-
ends at country houses. The redoubt-
able James, having introduced the
arty set to Japanese prints and misty
riverscapes, had become high-priest
of a cult of Orientalism (which four
years after “Patience” was to be
laughed at in “The Mikado”).

All audiences at “Patience,” wheth-
er composed of novices or smug de-

votees, have a perfect love-affair
with the ladies of the opera: the
twenty love-sick maidens (love-sick

all against their will), in their aesthetic
draperies; Lady Jane, whose ampli-
tude is matched by that of the ‘cello
(sometimes a bass-viol) she lugs
about; and that innocent dairy-maid,
Patience herself, who (though not on

 

a monument) smiles at grief as she
watohes the aesthetic ladies pining
for their poets.

Magnificent Uniforms

As for the males, the slightly
addled officers of the Dragoon
Guards, in their magnificent uniforms,
divert the audience as much as the
ladies—even though the guardsmen
are not Empyrean nor Della Crus-
can nor even Early English. Bun-
thorne and Grosvenor (the Wilde and
Swinburne of the opera) are the
embodiment of passing literary fash-
ions. Bunthorne, soulfully intense,
very precious, and somewhat droop-
ing, has eventually to yield to Gros-
venor (Archibald the All-Right), who
admits that his beauty is without
rival (“Would that I were but a
thought less beautiful than I am; but
candour compels me to admit that
I'm not!”).

Music-lovers cite the sextette (“I
hear the soft note of the echoing)
voice”) and the “Prithee, pretty
maiden” duet as two of the lovieliest
moments in all the operas. The Colo-
nel’s patter song, Bunthorne’s recita-
tive and discourse upon aestheticism,
the counterpoint of the protesting
Dragoons and the rapturous Maidens,
Lady Jane's dirge upon the state of
her figure, and the moralistic Magnet
and the Churn—these musical inspira-
tions are, as Lady Angela might say,
“too all-but.”

Gilbert as usual flatters the intel-
ligence of his audiences, and the fact
that the original “Patience” had a
run of 408 performances (with all
1300 seats taken at each perform-
ance) proves that the English audi-
ences were knowledgeable people.
Lexingtonians are not less so. Who,
among the hordes who will flock to
hear the local performances, will not
be able to pass with flying colors
(cobwebby grey velvet, no doubt) the
following Savoyard quiz? Identify
quickly Pandaean pleasure, Daphne-

 

phoric bound, Boucicault, peak-
haunting Peveril, Tupper, Sir Garnet
(thrashing a cannibal), Sir Paget
(about to trepan), Aceldama, Gros-

venor Gallery, Sewall & Cross, Jul-
lien (the eminent musico), and Cul-
ture’s palmiest day.

 

The chorus of love sick maidens,

 

By KLAUS EDER

Most of the reactions to my re-
marks reveal a symptomatic aspect:
they fail the real object I was con-
cerned with. One of my minor points
was a “so-called conservatism,” with
which label I seem to have touched
on most cherished values. In a kind
of self-defense the reactions fell back
on a sterile repetition of old argu-
ments they are only retelling old, old
stories, while casting things in my
teeth I never said,

Rather another kind of conservatism
is prevalent (and I am going to formu-
late this much harsher this time, aware
of probable ridiculous scorchers of
intolerance or monopoly of toler-
ance—no matter how meaningless
these labels are; for 1 made never
such a claim): W&L gentlemen—in
the jori in the following
ideal type: they cannot detach them-
selves in order to observe, much less
to evaluate; they are stirred by Satur-
day classes and the like; they are for
progress, but not too fast.

                

 

 

The More Things Change aes

 

Roaring °20’s Similar

By REEVE W. KELSEY

“Educationally your Alma Mater
seems on the eve of a great develop-
ment. The air of the campus is
vibrant with optimism and enthusi-
asm. Overflowing numbers, entire
harmony, athletic success, freedom
from misbehavior and disorder and
college spirit—all these combine to
make from the educational standpoint
a happy present and a bright future.”

Thus wrote Henry Louis Smith,
WAL’s seemingly eccentric president
of the "Twenties, on Page Three of
the January 13th, 1920, Alumni Edi-
tion of the Ring-tum Phi, As a matter
of fact, Smith's incessant writing of
letters to be published in the Ring-
tum Phi appears to today’s reader to
be quaint and amusing.

Impoverished Condition

Smith moved on and outlined the
impoverished condition of the Un-
versity’s finances: “Its tiny endowment
equals only $1,500 per student, instead
of the $6,400 which is now the aver-
age of colleges of its type .. . Financi-
ally she is facing dire emergency.”

Smith finished his message with a
plea to the alumni: “The Alumni of
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth,
Cornell, Leland Stanford are all rally-
ing to their imperiled institutions with
a magnificent zeal, a unanimous self-
sacrifice, a record-breaking liberality.”

“Let the Alumni of our historic
institution see to it that in this un-
exampled financial emergency their
Alma Mater shall not be crippled in
her great work for the lack of ade-
quated financial support, that her
energies shall be released to answer
the call of her great opportunity, and
that even more in the future than
in the past she shall be the South's
most fruitful nursery of America’s
leadership.”

they stay the same

editorial said, “If the typical old

 

Southern Collegian is a bit too heavy

The battle continued when the EC
passed the following resolution: “Re-

tion: “We, the members of the Junior
Class and the 13 Club, pledge our-
selves as gentlemen that we will not

The ubiquitous Ring-tum Phi edi-
tor glowed, “It is sincerely hoped

condition which certainly was not the
case at our last dance at least.”

Eder Clarifies Reform Crlticlenis
Of Traditional W&L Institutions

five hours before the spring dances

 

Apathy, parietal system and fra-
ternity system are only the “func-
tional requisites” which keep the sys-
tem going. The core of the problem
lies in the faculty. That is why I
should blame the faculty above all.
(I didn’t make that point very clear in
my first article; | owe the clarification
to the several responses I got in re-
action to it).

I think the real “ill” of this campus
is the composition of the student body.
A comparison of the social bio-
graphies of W&L students shows that
most come from moderately wealthy,
upper-middle-chass families. Alumni
and fathers of students tend to be
businessmen; the faculty is business-
oriented (at least in its key positions);
thus higher education here preserves
a situation which was quite common
several decades ago, characterized as
the “Golden Age and Gilded Cage.”

Business-Class Dominated

W&L Pugilists Participate In Golden Gloves Tourney

A joke in November became a
reality last week as sophomore Logan
Scott, “The Greenwood (S.C.) Fist”
boxed his way to the semi-finals of
the Virginia AAU Golden Gloves
Tournament,

The joke started when Tony Glea-
son, freshman law student and Notre
Dame boxing veteran, asked Scott
what he was doing. Scott said he was
Golden Gloves—and after over three
months of rigorous training, Gleason
made Scott true to his word,

Training

rhe co-training of Seott and Glea-
son was not an easy job. Working
out by themselves, a routine workout
consisted of 600 jumping jacks, 100
pushups, 150 situps, drills, strategy
sessions, sparring, speedbag workouts,
and road work every morning.

As they reflect on the period, W&L’s
boxers conceded that more sparring
would have been helpful.

Scott entered the tournament, spon-
sored by Richmond's West End Jay-
cees, aS a novice, meaning that he
had boxed less than six bouts, In
fact, Logan had never actually boxed
before. Gleason entered the open
competition.

lhe first night in Richmond, Scott
worried about his weight, his combi-
nations, and his life. But he didn’t
need to worry, as after a mere 35
seconds he had TKO’d his opponent.
Scott entered the small ring (“there's
no room to run”) as though his life
depended on what he did. He promptly
knocked his opponent down; the other

boxer got up, then was knocked down |

Was precipitated by a blow that drew
blood on his chin. A TKO was award-

ed his opponent.
The next night, Gleason was in
Scott’s corner. From the other side

of the ring came what looked like a
Grecian god, but Scott was confident.

Scott Outboxes Opponent

And almost rightly so. Scott out-
boxed his opponent for two rounds,
winning both on points. But in the
third and last round, after one minute,
Scott was hit hard in the face and
reeled back into the ropes. He was
out on a TKO,

After the fight, Scott warned his
vistor “You'd better stay in shape,
because I'll be back next year.” After
a short training break, Scott plans to
start practicing again.

There are current plans to start a
boxing club at W&L, so that next
year the schools can send a team to
Richmond. This would make W&L
eligible for a team trophy.

With the kind of help that Gleason
and Scott obtained this year, the club
already has a head start. The Physical
Education department went out of its
way to help the boys in their training.

A Lot of Help

Coach Lord refereed practice bouts
between Scott and Gleason, as well
as gave his advice and criticism on
certain strategy. Coach Miller always
was willing to give the two boxers
whatever supplies they needed, in-
cluding on their 2-day trip to Rich-
mond. Coach Stearns was the trainer.

Gleason’s boxing coach at Notre
Dame, Coach Napolitono, sent prac-

to observe how democratic education
functions and have to recognize how
a caste system defends itself against
democracy. (In my last article I call-
ed that phenomenon a “glass-cave”;
it would probably be better to call
it a “hot-house,” where holy tradi-
tions are rendered immune against the
outside world),

Dissenting “Outcasts”

The “outcasts” of this campus are
the dissenters. Their attitudes, even
their existence, are regarded as sort
of illegitimate on this campus. Never
really bothered by opposite view-
points, in peaceful harmony and con-
formity, with never challenged atti-
tudes, the W&L_ gentleman goes
through his college experiences with
an “echoing monologue!”

Another strikingly similar feature
became manifest while looking at the
attempts of reform by Woodrow Wil-
son, as Baltzall describes it: “Wilson
actually desired to make Princeton
an even more homogeneous body of
gentlemen-scholars. His preceptorial
and quadrangle plans envisioned a
series of small and intimate groups of
students and faculty-members pursu-
ing knowledge without the disruptive
class-decisions fostered by the existing
club system.”

Reformers Have Failed

Wilson failed; reformers on the
W&L campus have failed too. They
were too much of a “threat to the
system so dear to the hearts of many
powerful trustees.” But in the mean-
time Princeton has found its way into
modernity, Why does W&L still stay
aside?

¢

Several conclusions can now be
drawn:
1) W&L lags behind the historical
development;

2) The caste-like establishment on
this campus has already passed
its peak; the social defense of
caste is only an artificial one;

3) The modernizing counterattack
at W&L is overdue,

The last point suggests political act-
ion. And that is the most difficult
question: for “what” and “how” should
we change? Should we concentrate on
changes of institutional structures
which affect the student while he is
living here (I suggested abolition of
paternalism) or on those which affect
the type of students attracted? Where
one starts depends on policy-judg-
ments and possibilities, But a change
in one institutional structure will have
effects upon the rest of the system too,

at least it will upset the state of
equilibrium which seems to me—after
looking at it from different perspec-
tives—rather worthwhile.

Two-Fold Attack

Necessary would be a two-fold at-
tack (but that is probably utopian):
an abolition of paternalism which
makes that campus attractive for a
different kind of students too; a
revolution in the orientation of the
Admissions Office, a large dedication
of resources to the attraction of stu-
dents from various social and eco-
nomic backgrounds, and the recruit-
ment of a less business-oriented and
more anti-establishment faculty (1
borrowed the last three formulations
from a letter I received after the
publication of my first article).

The consequences could be a new
image, and maybe the realization of
possibilities which were restricted by
a mere traditionalistic and backwards
looking faculty and University ad-
ministration, those powerful and
sacred columns of persistence (ob-
stinacy).

MONEY: THE STORY OF AN ENGINEER

We all know, of course, that in this age of technology
every engineering senior is receiving fabulous offers of
employment, but do we realize just how fabulous these
offers are? Do we comprehend just how keenly industry
is competing? To illustrate, let me cite the true and typi-
cal case of E. Pluribus Ewbank, a true and typical senior.

One day last week while strolling across the M.1.T.
campus, E. Pluribus was hailed by a portly and prosper-
ous man who sat in a yellow convertible studded with
precious gem stones. “Hello,” said the portly and pros-
perous man, “I am Portly Prosperous, president of
American Xerographic Data Processing and Birth Con-
trol, Incorporated. Are you a senior?”

“Yes, sir,” said E. Pluribus.

“Do you like this car?” said Portly.

“Yes, sir,” said E. Pluribus.

“It’s yours,” said Portly.

“Thanks, hey,” said E. Pluribus.

“Do you like Personna Super Stainless Stee! Blades?”
said Portly.

“What clean living, clean shaven American does not?”
said E. Pluribus.

“Here is a pack,” said Portly. “And a new pack will
be delivered to you every twelve minutes as long as you
live.”

“Thanks, hey,” said E. Pluribus.

“Would your wife like a mink coat?” said Portly.

“I feel sure she would,” said E. Pluribus, “but I am
not married.”

“Do you want to be?” said Portly.

“What clean living, clean shaven American does not?”
said E. Pluribus.

Portly pressed a button on the dashboard of the con-
vertible and the trunk opened up and out came a nubile
maiden with golden hair, rosy knees, a perfect disposi-
tion, and the appendix already removed. “This is Svet-
lana O'Toole,” said Portly. “Would you like to marry her?”

“Is her appendix out?” said E. Pluribus.

“Yes,” said Portly.

“Okay, hey,” said E. Pluribus.

“Congratulations,” said Portly. “And for the happy
bride, a set of 300 monogrammed prawn forks.”

“Thanks, hey,” said Svetlana,

 

“Now then,” said Portly to E. Pluribus, “let us get
down to business. My company will start you at $75,000
a year, You will retire at full salary upon reaching the
age of 26. We will give you an eleven-story house made of
lapis lazuli, each room to be stocked with edible furniture,
Your children will receive a pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades every twelve minutes as long as they
shall live. We will keep your teeth in good repair and also
the teeth of your wife and children unto the third genera-
tion, We will send your dentist a pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades every twelve minutes as long as
he shall live, and thereafter to his heirs and assigns...
Now, son, I want you to think carefully about this offer,
Meanwhile here is 50 thousand dollars in small, un-
marked bills which places you under no obligation what-
soever.”’

“Well, it certainly seems like a fair offer,” said E.
Pluribus, “But there is something you should know, | am
not an engineer. In fact | don't go to M.L.T. at all, I just
walked over here to admire the trees. | am at Harvard,
majoring in Joyce Kilmer.”

“Oh,” said Portly.

“I guess I don't get to keep the money and the con-
vertible and the Personnas and the broad, do 1?” said EF
Pluribus.

“Of course you do,” said Portly. “And if you'd like the
job, my offer still stands.”

High School Seniors Interviewed

For R.

Twenty-one high school seniors
from eight states are visiting W&L
today and tomorrow as applicants
for Robert E. Lee and George F.
Baker Scholarships.

The high school seniors arrived
today from points in North Carolina,
Fennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Flor-
ida, West Virginia, Kentucky and
Virginia. Fifteen minute interviews
this morning with the Committee on
Financial Aid, made up of then mem-
bers of the faculty and administra-
tion, screened the number of appli-
cants for the Baker scholarships and
made final decisions on Lee Scholars.

Those who made it through the
screening will be required to have
another interview tomorrow morning.
Interviewing them this time will be
alumnus Edward H, Ould, president
of the First National Exchange Bank
of Virginia and member of the
Alumni Board of Trustees; Martin P.
Burks, also an alumnus and General
Counsel of Norfolk and Western

 

Railroad; and Dean of the College, |
William W. Pusey. The decision of |
this committee is final as to who will
ultimately receive Baker Scholarships.

Baker Scholarships To End
At W&L After Nine Years

Afier being awarded for nine
vears, the George F. Baker Scholar-
ships will be discontinued at Wash-
ington and Lee after this year.

lhe George F. Baker Trust of New
York City selected W&L in 1960 as
one of twelve colleges in the United
States to award Baker grants. Each
year the Baker Trust rotates its mon-
ey to different colleges and univer-
sities so as to include as many as
possible. The nine-year tenure for
the grants at Washington and Lee is

longer than many undergraduate
schools have been allowed to award
them

the Baker Scholarships at W&L

are awarded to entering applicants
who reside in the “general area from
which Washington and Lee students
are usually drawn,” which is to say,
predominently “Southern areas.” The
donors hope, but do not require,
that a substantial number of scholar-
ship holders will make their lifework
constructive business activity, “for
the awards were made possible by the
work of men who devoted their lives

 

io business careers, and the present

ject of study and concern.”

E. Lee, Baker Grants

Usually seven to nine awards of
each scholarship are made.

All applicants chosen to vie for the
scholarships have been picked from
the best applicants that have been
accepted to the university and have
shown sufficient need for financial
aid. Only one of the twenty has al-
ready sent in his acceptance. He was
an early-decision applicant.

While on campus, the prospective
scholars will talk with present Rob-
ert E. Lee and George F. Baker
scholars, who will show them around
the school and take them to classes.
The emphasis will be to make indi-
vidual students’ time available to the
the vistors.

At 1:15 today the applicants met
for a luncheon in the Commons, at
which time President Robert E. R.
Huntley greeted them and William
A. Noell, director of financial aid,
announced the results of the morning
interviews. The applicants will be
free this afternoon and tonight to
do whatever they want.

Both scholarships are four-year
awards in the amount of the individ-
ual’s financial need. They are both
contingent on the students’ retaining

a 3.0 grade-point ratio. By terms of
the Robert E. Lee Scholarship, Lee
scholars will come from the South-
ern States, and preference will be given
to those planning to go into public

Winston Named
WLUR Head

Charles E. Winston, currently an
instructor in the Department of Jour-
nalism and Communications and man-
ager of W&L’s WLUR-FM radio sta-
tion, is to become full-time manager
of the station next year.

In addition to his duties at WLUR,
Winston now teaches radio and tele-
vision courses in the School of Jour-
nalism and serves as executive direc-
tor of the Southern Interscholastic
Press Association and advisor to
Sigma Delta Chi National Journal-
ism Society. He has indicated that he
has not yet decided which of those po-
sitions he will keep next year.

By accepting this position, Winston
becomes the fourth full-time faculty
member in the Department of Jour-
nalism. He stated that his formal
appointment to the post on a full-time
basis apparently crystallizes the office.

Concerning his new role, Winston
remarked, “I will look forward to
devoting my full time and energies
to the radio station.” Possible changes
next year include “new programs and
new people.” Although he stressed the
fact that no definite plans have yet
been made, he said that “we want to
expand our audience and do unique
projects in the community.” He add-
ed, “I will have a lot of rethinking
to do over the summer,”

Winston observed that WLUR-FM

Op cimism Reigns In Reagan Forces Richmond Legislator Discusses

optimistic about their

White is confident that Reagan has
enough to offer to surmount the
predominantly pro-Nixon sentiment
on the campus. White predicts Reagan
will win on the first ballot in both

When questioned on just how
Reagan will overcome Nixon's popu-
candidate's | jarity without announcing his candi-
dacy, White replied that although
Reagan hasn't announced his candi-
dacy, he hasn't announced he is not
a candidate. This allows his name to
be placed on the state primaries,
particularly the primaries in Cali

Oregon, White believes that he will

On the local scene, White is con

The idea for an underground paper

twelve students are actively involved
in working on the paper. Many of
the same students also said they were
active in the Students Against the
War movement.

Although the chief aim of “Notes
From Underground” is to stick to the
controversial matters around the
campus and be “a responsible critic
of the university,” twenty per cent of
the paper may be dedicated to the
Vietnam issue, but no more.

Curriculum Committee Criticizes

EC On Dismissing Of Chairman

(Editor's Note: In a unanimous
action Tuesday night, the Executive
Committee voted to replace the
chairman of the student Curriculum
Committee, alleging that he had
failed to submit a report to the EC
on the committee's activities despite
a number of requests that he do so.
On Wednesday night the remainder
of the Currimulum Committee met
and drew up the following letter.)

Dear Sir:

The Executive Committee's flair for
the dramatic has left us (the members
of the Curriculum Committee) at a
complete loss. In one sense we are
more than simply stage-struck at the
theatrical manner in which the E.C.
deposed chairman Lane Steinger, but
in a more immediate sense we are
angered at the way they went about
it. Forgetting for the moment their
justification for so acting, we would
like to make clear that there was no
effort made by any E.C. member to
contact the secretary of the Cur-
riculum Committee, Swede Henberg,
to inform him (or any other mem-
bers) of the steps taken to remove
Steinger. Obviously, such an attempt
would have served more purpose than
merely to give recognition to the com-
mittee itself; it seems logical that those
of us who are actively concerned
should merit more explanation than
a single paragraph in the newspaper,
which is all any of us have right
now.

Second (and here it seems the E.C,
has shown a regretable lack of good
taste) Steinger himself was not per-
sonally informed of the action. He
was left to discover his removal along
with anyone else who happened to
read last Tuesday's Ring-tum Phi.
Surely this is not a question of how
much justification the E.C. has in
their action. More precisely, it is an
oversight for which we can see ab-
solutely no defense.

All the above leads directly to the
question of exactly what our stance
as members ought to be. With no
access whatsoever to even an attempt-
ed explanation of the E.C.’s complete
ground of action, the remainder of the
Curriculum Committee is totally un-
certain as to what our reaction should
entail, Nor can we be sure whether
the E.C. acted in partial ignorance of
the facts. Since their action took
place without asking any members
of our committee to express an opin
ion, we can safely assert that the B.C

voied without information from at
least One Viewpoint: ours
Concerning the one criticum of

which we are aware (via the Ring-tum
Phi) charging Steinger with negligence
in submitting a report of the com
mittee’s progress, we can offer only
a partial answer. True, our progress
to date has not been substantial in a
but if must be re

membered that the Curriculum Com-
mittee did not exist before this year, |
If the E.C. expected numerous specific
programs the first year, they should
not have, Undoubtedly the E.C.’s main
complaint applies to the poll of the
political science classes, which took
place at the end of last semester. The
delay in that report is in part due
to reservations harbored by some
members of the committee as to the
feasibility of such a course. Steinger
is not entirely at fault.

Still, our main complaint rests on
the fact the E.C. has shown absolutely
no indications of asking our opinion.
Even though they may be somewhat
sensitive about their ultimate power
over the Curriculum Committee, it
seems to use that the E.C.’s response
proves, at best, arbitrary. Quite sud-
denly they are asking for applications
for a new chairman. Meeting Wednes-
day night, we agreed that—for the
time being—none of the current com-
mittee members would apply. What
we do ask is that the E.C. postpone
selection of a new chairman until
after we have had a chance to send
a representative to express our views
directly. That way, also, we can our-
selves be briefed as to the complete
facts on the situation.

Today there has been misunder-
standing on both sides is, of course,
an enormous understatement. It seems

 

to us that the E.C. would be wise to
agree to our moritorium in order to
clear up what (from our side at least)
seems a very hazy situation. Further-
more, certain other questions remain:
the E.C. tells us Steinger is no longer
chairman, but they say nothing about
his status on the committee itself. Is
he still a member? Finally, it seems
to us that a new chairman should
come from among the current mem-
bers, or at least be subject to our
recommendation. A person new to the
committee would meet the obvious
problem of being unfamiliar with the
directives decided on to date
In summation it seems the EC

should want to reexamine their action
in light of the criticisms we have rais
ed, We cannot emphasize too strongly
that if the E.C. ignores our plea for
establishing some sort of understand
ing, they will seriously hinder the
effectiveness of whatever course the
Curriculum Commitice eventually de
cides to follow.

Sincerely,
Swede Henberg

College, schools of similar academic
and social standing of W&L, have
already instituted or are in the plan-
ning stages of an independent exam
schedule, which might prove satis-
factory to our curriculum. Mary
Baldwin is presently testing such a
system and, having used it once, has
found it be be quite a good system;
in their plan the student is given the
responsibility to determine her own
testing schedule.

Iwo weeks before the actual period
the student signs up to take exams at
a certain time during an eight day
period, at either 8:30 a.m. or 1:30
p.m. On the specified day to take
the exam, the student picks up her
test, which is placed in a_ sealed
envelope, turns in a card which her
teacher has previously given her to
receive her exam, and then takes the
exam in the Academic Building. Upon
completion of it, she returns both
the question sheet and her booklet to
a central desk and receives her ad-
missions card back, which meanwhile
has been validated by a teacher. The
students then instructed not to
discuss the test with anyone who has
not taken the test and are set free.

Hollins is presently planning a simi-

afe

lar system in which the student is
permitted to arrange her own exam
schedule: this would replace their

plan of take-outs and
pre-scheduled exams. Under the Hol-
lins’ method the student would be
more personally restricted, as it goes
to extremes in its concern over the
honor system. The student would pick
up her exam in a central office dur-
ing three conveniently chosen times
during each day of the period, would
then proceed to a designated room,
which would be proctored, and have |
the time of her admission to the room |
validated By the monitor, Upon the}
completion of the exam, the student |
faculty proctor would record the
time of the student's leaving, and the
student then immediately go
buck to the central office and hand in
her test

Under both systems such exams
ws fine arts and the spoken langu-
ages courses would be held at a
certain predetermined time because
of the obvious impracticality of
student arrangement of these tests,
Also, classes containing large oum-
hers of people would require sub-
mission of exams by a set date, so
ws to allow the teacher ample time
to grade them.

 

Such an independent examination
chedule would have a great effect
lessening of the presure as
ciated with exams. Mrs. Martha
Grafton, Dean of Mary Baldwin Col
lege, remarked concerning this, “The
nain thine U will do is end the

a world that is less perfect, but at
least real,

Our reputation is no more easily
soiled than that of Hollins, VPI, or
Mary Baldwin, or any other member
of the VASG. Yet, they were willing
to take the “risk” because, as seems
obvious, the benefits to be derived
were more significant and probable
than the worst possible embarrassment
they might “suffer” from collective
action taken by the VASG.

This particular line of prattle
against joining the VASG is more
than vaguely reminiscent of the con-
troversy over ratification of the
League of Nations Covenant in 1919,
when many Senators feared that
Article 10—which guaranteed the ter-
ritorial integrity of every member
state, by armed force if necessary—
would drag the United States into an
unwelcome foreign war. So the
United States did not join the League,
and thereby helped precipitate World
War IL.

If Washington and Lee does not
support the VASG now, in its mild-
mannered infancy, we will have only
ourselves to reproach for the absence
of a moderate and reasonable alter-
native to the NSA.

VASG No NSA

The EC has lost its whole sense

of perspective if it equates member-
ship in the VASG with membership
in NSA. First, Virginia students are
unlikely to assume the same posture |
as their counterparts at Berkley; for!

 

SENATOR ALBEN BARKLEY (arrow) proceeds up Main Street in the

better or worse, the Old Dominion
is not a seed-bed for any civil dis-
order more significant than a panty
raid, some occasional pot, and the
hallowed tradition of the Saturday
Night Drunk. Second, the purposes of
the VASG are substantially different
from those of NSA. Rather than try-

ing to create a bloc of “Student
Power” after the European’ and
South American models, such as is

the object of NSA, the VASG more
modestly seeks to improve the quali-
ty and scope of student government
in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
In brief, the mission of NSA is po-
litical and ideological, while that of
the VASG is administrative and edu-
cational.

Washington and Lee has an obli-
gation to assist in the building of the
VASG, which is still young and pli-
able. Our university has a long tra-
dition of providing leadership for the
Commonwealth, and the VASG is no
exception.

Are we fearful of competing with
other schools? Could our represen-
tatives to VASG conventions be less
capable than those from other
schools? Clearly, the answer is a
resounding, “No.”

Our students are at least equal to
the challenge of VASG, and should
be given an opportunity to prove it.
We can always resign from the or-
ganization if it proves necessary.

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

Down With Ring-tum Phi

Dear Sir:

This letier is in response to the
section of Tuesday's Ring-tum Phi |
entitled “Letter from the Editor.” |
From it I quote, “Signed letters are
invariably published in one of the
two Editions, unless their content is |
such that publication would bring us
legal grief—and in that case, we let
the writer know.”

A few weeks ago | wrote a signed |
letter to the Ring-tum Phi praising |
courage—the courage of Jim Lowe
for writing his controversial letter and
the courage of the Ring-tum Phi for |
publishing it. | added that | hoped |
the faculty would have the courage
to accept students’ criticism like the
men they are supposed to be.

It appears that I overestimated the
courage of the Ring-tum Phi and
the faculty. The letter has not been
published and I have been told nothing
by the Ring-tum Phi, although | did
hear informally that pressure was
being placed on the paper to let the
issue die. It also would seem that
the “Letter from the Editor” was
merely a mistake and my letter was
overlooked (although | did make in
quiries about it), | could call the
article a mistake or misunderstanding,
but I prefer to call it simply a blatant
untruth

to freedom in the country today are
1) of power (for this
read “states rights to insure that fed

rights to everyone”); 2) excessive
spending (for this read “it is fine to
pour $30 billion dollars a year inte

a tiny fraction of that amount in

I submit that Thurmond’s “threa

the pronouncement and implementa

iolally out of touch with reality. The
fundamental “threats to our freedom”
are totally overlooked in the gen

THE MOST IN DRY CLEANING

 

Lexington Shopping Park

 

By ROY CARLTON

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse team
got off to a fast start this week, taking
on three fine teams in games on
four consecutive days. While the first
game, a 14-3 rout at the hands of
Adelphi could hardly be considered
an accurate appraisal of the team’s
potential, the Blue showed steady im-
provement during the game and again
the next day against Ohio State.

The week's scrimmages presented
numerous problems to the Generals.
Coach Szalsa was still experimenting
with different lines, and the players
had yet to become acclamated to one
another. Another complication lay in
the prescence of several important
freshmen bidding for starting assign-
ments. With the opening game against
Hofstra coming up next Saturday,
these are problems that have to be
worked out if the General’s are to
avoid another 15-2 disaster at the
hands of the Flying Dutchmen.

rhe first scrimmage, against
Adelphi (a rival school of Hofstra’s),
showed how much the Blue needed
work. The Long Islanders completely
dominated play in the first half and
walked off with a 10-1 lead.. As the
game wore on, however ,the Generals
began improving and started shifting

a, the play from their own goal area.

Generals Outhustle OSU

On Wednesday, the Blue took on
big Ohio State team. While the
Buckeyes were an extremely fast team
with good stickhandling, the Generals
kept things close. Although the final
score read 4-2, W&L might very well
have won if they had experimented
less. Freshman Bill Ingersoll played
goal very creditably in his first appear-
ance and at One point there were five
freshmen in the line-up: Ingersoll,
Bill Brumback, Whit Morrill, John
Knipp, and Frank Brooks, While most
of the action centered around the
WAL goal, there were numerous oc-
casions when the Generals put hard
pressure on the OSU goal, as evi-
denced by the fact that they were only
outshot 19-18. Hustling play account-
ed for much of the team’s success as
they came up with most of the ground
balls.

of the season, as evidenced by last
year’s debacle against Hofstra. Szlasa,
aided zy co-captains Terry Griffin
and Charlie Stewart, is determined to
avert that problem this year by a
heavy exhibition schedule, “If we
really wanted to win these games we
wouldn't have scheduled four in four
days.” The team ended the week
with two games against Yale. The
Blue finish their pre-season training
Monday against Dartmouth.
Yesterday against Yale, the Gen-
erals got off to a quick start, scor-
ing two goals in the first five minutes
of play. Attackman Chip Chew scored
both of them unassisted after circling
from behind the crease. As the Blue
continued to dominate play during
the quarter, it began to look as if
WAL was headed for its first success
of the season, but such was not the
case. Quickly regaining its composure,
the Eli squad played extremely sharp
lacrosse from the second period on.
Their passing became much more
deliberate and crisp and the Generals
were unable to mount a sustained
attack. Adding to WA&L’s difficulties
was an inability from the beginning
of the game to clear the ball from
there own end. The first Yale goal was
a direct result of this. After a save,
goalie Dave Johnson passed from
inside the crease to a midfielder at
midfield. The ball never reached the
middle though, as a Yale attackman
reached up and intercepted the pass.
There was no one between him and
Johnson and he had a straightway
shot. Johnson never had a chance.
Taking heart from the goal, the
Bulldogs scored again before the half.
A quick start in the third quarter
netted Yale three more goals. The
Generals did score once more in the
fourth period, and the spectators were
even able to sense it coming. For the
first time since the opening minutes
the Generals were able to set up
their offense. Terry Griffin, waited
for the attack to get into position
The whole field seemed absolutely
still. Suddenly Griffin dodged around
his man and fired a perfect pass to

  

 

Frank Brooks, streaking across the
goal mouth. Brooks fielded the pass
and fired it in all in one motion in|
one of the prettiest plays of the after- |
noon

The game ended like that with the
score 5-3 Yale, although there was a!
disputed call at the end when time,
ran out just as 4 shot was flying!

the recent legislative session, he serv-
ed as a member of the House General
Laws Committee.

Dr. Reid began his address with a
short history of the role of the
Negro voter in Virginia since the
days of Reconstruction. All types of
devices were used to cut down on
the Negro vote. All-white primaries,
literacy tests, and anti-Negro laws
helped to keep the Negro from real-|
izing his true importance in state
politics.

Concerning the upcoming  presi-|
dential elections, Dr. Reid said that
he believed that the majority of Vir-
ginia Negroes would vote for Presi-
dent Johnson if the opposing Re-
publican candidate was Richard Nix-
on. He felt that if Senator Robert
Kennedy ran against Gov, Nelson
Rockefeller, the Negro vote would be
pretty well divided.

close behind, however, for third place
honors.

Hunsicker of Richmond led the
way to another 1-2-3 Spider finish in
the half mile with a good early sea-
son time of 1:58.9. The visiting two-
milers were equally impressive, with
both winner Guest and runner-up
Cline breaking the 10-minute mark.
The winning time was 9:40.6, with
Corbet Bryant of WA&L fiuishing
strong for another General third.

Richmond dominated the field
events also, but here the home team
displayed a star of its own, sophomore
jumper extraordinaire Mike Neer
While the Spiders were out-throwing
the Generals, capturing the first two
places in the shot, javelin, and discus,
Neer was placing second in the long
jump and third in the triple jump
His big victory came in the high jump,
where the lanky Alexandria, Va.,
native battled Richmond's Jim Livesay
to finally win at the height of 6°4”,
which set a new school record in
that event.

However, Necr's win was not nearly
enough. In the final event of the day,
Richmond's mile relay victory epi-

Indepnedent Exam Schedule Feasible?

(Continued from page 3) |

during this past semester’s trial run, |
Dean William W. Pusey felt that no
matter what kind of schedule is insti-
tuted, there will always be some sort
of pressure; he also believed that
under our present exam plan tension
has been eliminated to a great extent
because of the more liberal spacing
of exams. William J. Watt, Assistant
Dean of the College, also believed
that our present program offers the
same easing effect that an independent
system would possess.

Che problem of the overcrowding
of semester tests has been almost
totally solved by the present schedule
at W&L. The possibility of having
three and four exams on consecutive
days still, however, exists; such a situa-
tion could make or break a student
during this all-important time. By giv-
ing the student the opportunity to ar-
range his own schedule, a person
could adjust his schedule, such that
he woul dnot be forced to take tests
for which he may be unprepared or
just too “bagged” from the tedious
strain of studying.

denied such basic freedoms as the
right to vote? What does he say to
the South Carolina Negro who risks
his life in Viet Nam to insure the
South Vietnamese “right of self de-
termination,” but is denied equal op-
portunity and the right to vote in
his own country? Thurmond speaks
of “freedom” when white bigotry in
Orangeburg, S. C., results in three
deaths, simply because human beings
were denied access to public accom-
modations. “Threats to freedom,”

indeed!

Thurmond’s contention that “hard
core communists” led the assualt dur-
ing the peace march on the Pentagon
is highly debatable. Nevertheless, no
amount of innuendo can alter the fact
that increasingly large number of
patriotic Americans are against our
course of action in Viet Nam. To
debate our Viet Nam policy is laud-
able, but it is ludicrous to even sug-
gest that the commitment of over
$30 billion a year and half a million
men is “ignoring the communist men-
ace to the world.” Rather, what we
ignore in formulating our all too
sanguine solutions is the fact that no
problem so simple that it can be re-
duced to such an oversimplification
as “the monolithic communist men-
ace.” Our stated purpose in Viet
Nam is to “insure the right of self
determination of the Vietnamese peo-
ple.” If, in fact, we are prolonging
this war for any other reason, then
we would do well to ponder the
meaning of the word “imperialists”!
If we are using the Vietnamese people
to further our own ends, no matter
how noble we feel those ends are, then
the tearm “American imperialist” is
fitting. Thurmond speaks of “outside
agitators” in referring to South Car-
olina’s internal racial problems. He

described

The chance that a student would
take all of his exams at the beginning

/or the end of the period, of course,

is quite probable, but at Mary Baldwin
no serious difficulty arose because of
this. Dean Grafton pointed out that
she found a steady stream of papers
continued throughout the interval, and
that very few waited until the very
last day or took them in the first week
of the schedule. Professor Charles W.
Williams of the Math Department be-
lieved that W&L students would put
off the tests until the last day; he
compared this system with the pres-
ent scheduling process in which the
students make over three hundred
changes ‘per semester, mainly for the
purpose of gaining a schedule which
would better suit their personal sleep-
ing and social habits,

Parralleling this aspect is the char-
acteristic of the independent exams
being symmetrical with the student's
curriculum, By his arranging of tests
in an order more suitable to him, the
person can allocate more time to
study his hardest courses. Dean Watt
believed that the present system gave
sufficient flexibility of study time and
that the independent exams would not
alter it a great deal, Both Dean Watt
and Dean Pusey agreed that such
symmetry in the student's schedule
would be incongruent with that of the
professor. Teachers would have to be

examination period to clear up any
misprints or incomprehension of the
questions. This, saying the least, would
be of the greatest inconvenience to the
professor.

The last aspect of the independent
scheduling of exams is that it would
show that the faculty has a respect
for the maturity and the responsi-
bility of the student, As instituted
now at Mary Baldwin, a certain
faith is placed in the student's in-
tellectual abilities, but not in her
integrity.

Judge Merhige
Speaks Tonight

United States District Judge Robert
M. Merhige Jr. will speak at Wash-
ington and Lee tonight in Tucker
Hall. The judge's visit is being spon-
sored by the Student Bar Association
Speaker Program.

Judge Merhige is a graduate of
High Point College, and he received
his law degree at the University of
Richmond Law School. At Richmond,
he was Chancellor of the Exchecquer
in the McNeill Law Society and secre-
tary of the Student Bar.

Richmond Lawyer

In 1958 he joined the law firm of
Bremner, Merhige, Byrns, Montgom-

The Viest Pamily in residence at the President's Home:

Clayton Epes Williams
1891-1968

Clayton Epes Williams, re-
tired dean of the Washington
and Lee University School of
Law, died in a Lexington hos-
pital early Monday. He was 77.

A professor at the University
here for 49 years, Williams
served as dean from 1944 until
his retirement in 1960. He re-
mained, however, on the fac-
ulty, as distinguished lecturer
in law, until his death,

University President Robert
E. R. Huntley, a former law
student of Dean Williams, said
“his death is a loss which will
be deeply felt, not only on the
campus and in Lexington, but
among the hundreds of students
upon whose lives his influence
has been profound and inspir-
ing.

“He was, above all, a truly
great teacher,” President Hunt-
ley continued. “His memorial
permanent one in the
and minds of his stu-

is a
hearts
dents.”

Dean Charles P. Light Jr.,
who succeeded Williams as dean
of the law school, had similar
remarks: “Dean Williams was
one of the great teachers of the
law,” Dean Light said. “His
loss will be deeply felt by all

of us.”

  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  

Dean Williams began his
long legal career as a student
at Washington and Lee in 1908,
alter attending Massanutten
Academy in his native Wood-
siock, Va. President of his class
his senior year, he received his
law degree in 1912 and was
awarded the honorary LL.D.
degree from Hampden-Sydney
College in 1951.

After graduation, he estab-
lished his law practice in Wood-
stock, where he subsequently
became Master Commissioner
in Chancery of the Circuit
Court (1913-16) and Common-
wealth’s Attorney for Shenan-
doah County (1916-19),

Dean Williams then returned
to Washington and Lee in 1919
as associate professor of law,
He was promoted to full pro-
fessor in 1920, to acting dean
in 1944 and to dean in 1946

He was a member of Omicron
Delta Kappa leadership fra-
ternity, Phi Delta and Order
of the Coif legal societies, and
Pi Kappa Alpha social fra
ternily.

VASG President Speaks To EC
About Purposes Of Organization

Last night Taze Schultz, the presi-
dent of the Virginia Association of
Student Governments, addressed the
EC to explain the purposes of his
organization and to answer possible
questions that members of the EC
might have. His appearance was in
response to the rejection of VASG
membership more than a month ago
by a 7-1 EC vote.

Curriculum Committee

In other action the EC announced
that applications for chairman of the
Curriculum Committee would be open
another week and that appointment
of the committee head would be de-
layed until the meeting after spring
vacation,

Election Plans

[he EC also announced the times
for “Big 4” elections and petitions.
The initial petitions of 150 names are
due at 6 p.m. on Monday, April 15.
They should be given to Jody Kline
at 805 McCorkle or at the Phi Kap
house.

Speeches for the candidates are be-
ing scheduled for the 16th in Evans
Dining Hall at 7 p.m.

If more than two candidates are
running for any position a primary
will take place on Thursday, April
18 while the election will be held on
Monday, April 22.

Class Elections

Action on the schedule for class
elections was deferred until the stu-
dent body oflicer elections have been
completed.

Schultz hoped that he could clear
up the objections of the EC to VASG
membership by answering the ques-
tions. The initial objections of the EC
were about association of W&L’'s

English Department Offers
Prose and Verse Awards

The five Mahan awards in creative
writing will be given by the English
department this spring. Four awards
will be granted for prose entries, and
one for verse entries.

The awards consist of a $100 ex-
emption from college fees during the
coming session, or the option of a
$60 cash stipend, Two prose awards
are open to freshmen, one to sopho-
mores, and one to juniors. The verse
award is open to men from any class
in the college except seniors.

May Decisions

Decisions will be reached early in
May. and awards will be announced
on the June commencement program.
All entries must be submitted by April
22 to Payne 32-A. No student may
submit more than two prose entries
and one verse entry.

All entries must be typewritten and
signed by a pen-name chosen by the
author, Attached firmly to each entry
there must be a sealed envelope with
the writer's pen-name on the outside,
containing the writer's real name,

name with an organization that might
be issuing policy statements that W&L
students did not agree with but would
be published with approval implicit
in W&L’s membership.

Schultz replied that the organiza-
tion was primarily directed at dis-
cussion and that no steps toward
policy statements of a larger nature
than student government problems
were planned.

Committee System

He explained that the basis of
VASG was the committee system and
that the committees themselves de-
termined the direction that their com-
mittees might take. The committees
would serve as forums for discussion

 

of problems in specific areas, such as
entertainment booking.

At no time would the decisions of
the committees be binding on the
member schools, according to Schultz,
and a member school could withdraw
its membership at any time it wished.

Steve Sandler commented that at
the Fall Conference of VASG which
he attended the committees seemed
effective and under good leadership
and direction,

Schultz went on to list the colleges
and universities in Virginia that were
members of the association. Among
the schools that are included are
Hampden-Sydney, Hollins, VMI, VPI,
Sweetbriar, Mary Baldwin, UVa, and

 

 

William and Mary. The only large
schools in the state unrepresented are
Virginia Union and the University of
Richmond,

Schultz said that Virginia Union
declined to join because it was not
offered charter membership and the
student government of the Negro
school felt slighted.

The student government of the
University of Richmond had changed
during the period of formation of the
VASG and earlier supporters of the
VASG had been replaced by students
who were lukewarm toward the idea
because local campus matters took

up too much of their time to allow for
VASG participation.

 

Lecture-Service-Relay Format To Be Continued Again

Greek Week Plans Progress

The Greek Week Committee has
announced that the second annual
edition of the IFC-sponsored event
will take place April 10 thru 12. The
format will remain basically the same
as it was last year, though a few of
the “rough spots” (such as the point
scoring) have been smoothed out.

There will be three phases to the
activities, which will attempt to
demonsirate the various aspects of
fraternities:

Lecture-Discussion

The first of the three, the lecture-
discussion program, will provide in-
formative as well as interesting ma-
terial about fraternities specifically,
ind life at Washington and Lee in
general. If possible, this year's pro
gram will include speakers from out
side the community who will

jective insight into our problems and

Drama at W&L,; or,
legitimizing the stepchild

It’s gratifying to know that the Courses and Degrees Com-
mittee met this afternoon to consider Troub Theatre Director
Lee Kahn’s proposal to expand the number of course offerings
in the theatre and dramatics, and also to double (from one—
Mr. Kahn himself—to two) the number of faculty in that
area of the arts. The Courses and Degrees Committee really is
the most educationally liberal of this University’s countless
faculty-legislative bodies. The C-&-D Committee has approved
a great many worthwhile changes, and has passed not one
measure which—either from the students’ point of view or
from the Hill’s own—was undesirable. Mr. Kahn’s proposal
is eminently legitimate, and perhaps even necessary to Wash-
ington and Lee’s stated purposes and functions—and there
is no other committee or administrative unit more likely to
recognize this than Courses and Degrees.

When we went to press this afternoon, the C-&-D Commit-
tee’s conclusions had not been reached. But after deriving
confidence in it from its record in the past, we should like to
note that a favorable decision, which we expect, is essential
to ending at least one of the crises-of-sorts in the Department
of Fine Arts. Mr. Kahn has been offered what he describes
as an extremely attractive position at another college, where
drama and theatre are being debastardized, brought under
the college’s wing as an honest-to-God respectable part of the
curriculum; where theatre is no longer just a necessary nui-
sance, no longer academe’s thalidomide baby. This college has
arranged to build for Mr. Kahn, if he likes—and he does—
an “exciting” new theatre. Compared with what he has to
work with here, it sounds to us like Mecca.

But Mr. Kahn has said he’ll stay here, if he is (1) promised
that a new theatre will eventually be built and that it will be
given reasonably high priority-ranking; and if (2) course-
offerings in drama here are expanded to a point of some com-
prehensiveness, beginning with the proposal of the C-&-D
Committee today—that is, if he can be assured that drama will
cease to be Washington and Lee’s ugly academic stepchild.

The first promise was made by the administration some time
ago, and it has since been reaffirmed periodically. If the sec-
ond was forthcoming this afternoon from the Courses and De-
grees Committee, and if it is to be implemented by the 1969-
1970 school year (Mr. Kahn’s target date), then W&L will
have not only taken another giant step forward in the rather
idealistic sphere of academic eminence, but we will also have
pragmatically assured the retention at this University of a
theatre director who has already done more than a world of
good for Washington and Lee, whom we decidedly do not
want to lose for any reason, and who could not be very easily
replaced, if at all.

One year from now: not the millen-

Dean of Students Edward C. Atwood

It is again nearing election time, the
roses are red, the politicos are politic-

doubtedly there will be someone,
coveting the mandate of the student
body, who will present a platform
of “A Chicken in Every Pot, A Broad
in Every Bed.”

Speaking of platforms, it struck us
that it could be quite amusing to
delve into our archives and find the
platforms of Messrs. Nash, Faulk
and Kline. In fact, we did do that
and found, that like all good up-
standing politicians, they did not do
all that they promised.

Nash presented to the student body
a seven-point platform which stressed
as its goal to make W&L a “great
University” as opposed to being a
purely “good University.” There has
not seemed to be a great earth-shak-

the Honor System (but not involving
Mr. Preston, and not involving any-
body connected with the Ring-tum

System matters is something in which
this newspaper feels it has no right
to involve itself. With the assurance
that a menrber of the Executive Com-

the person who informed us of it), we
presumed it would be taken care of
appropriately; and therefore we de-

We don't buy that. The Friday Edi-
tion not only saw Mr. Preston’s letter;
the Friday Edition set that letter in
type March 1, and then decided for
whatever reasons (perhaps the same
as the Tuesday Edition’s reasons?)
not to publish it. The two Editions of
this newspaper are entirely separate,
editorially; and saying “The Friday
Edition can not be held responsible
for the actions or policies of the
Tuesday Edition” does not sufficiently
explain why, after the letter had been

set in type by the same Friday Edition |

that “would have been happy to print
his letter.” the Friday Edition failed

meetings. This would include a repre-

fallen into obscurity.

on. Just to be sure the whimsical
cigarette-burn comment remains
whimsey, ashtray-stands will be pro-
vided in great abundance.

This reporter took a quick and
casual little mental journey through
the magnificent, impressive floor-plans
and interior-decorating-samples — yes-
terday, courtesy of the Student Cen-
ter Planning Committee. We were
struck (in only the most favorable
sense) by—among many, many others
—these random highlights:

The E, C. Room, It will have its
own separate entrance so the Center
won't have to be closed during trials
(they’ve thought of nearly everything
we've never had before). The carpet
there has a red and rich, rich olive-
green pattern; the walls are a luxuri-
ous beige burlap-like textured linen.

It will have a gigantic semi-circular
desk for formal meetings of the E. C.,
and seats for 30 or so spectators. The
four offices, which will double when
necessary aS witness-rooms, are com-
fortably but not extravagantly fur-
nished.

The Main Lounge. Three brass
chandeliers catch one’s interest im-
mediately. This place will be rampant
with overstuffed chairs and daven-
ports, like an English club, and is
going to be very formally, very richly
decorated, mostly in deep reds and
blues.

The tavern. A_ real, you're-not-
kidding Andy-Capp type bar with
stools and standing space; 21 solid
wood tables that the Hill doesn’t care
whether you carve upon or not; 10
or so booths; with fabric covering on
the walls, dark royal blue with bright
red gamecocks here and there (also
fabric, of course)—and this will be
the biggest room in the Center, big-
ger than even the new room at the
cy

The games room. Down a half-
flight of stairs from the tavern, the
“games room” (euphemism for card-
parlor-and-pool-hall) will contain five
pool tables and all equipment, two
ping-pong tables and three card tables.
The room will be attended whenever
it’s open, and there is some thought
being given to the possibility of charg-
ing a nominal sum for a rack (cloths
are expensive and have to be replaced
twice a year). This room, by the way,
is in the basement, where the book
store used to be when the Co-op was
over in that neck of the woods,

There's more. A_ grand student-
activities meeting room on the sec-
ond floor, behind a number of offices
that will be shared by the various
sanctioned organizations—the Calyx,
perhaps; maybe the Ring-tum Phi
business manager, and so on. And a
maze of other rooms and places, too
numerous to describe.

The whole place will be air-condi-

Black-eye for W&L

American Flag
Is Stolen Here
At Lee Chapel

Nothing is sadder than a tree with-
out leaves except for a flagpole with-
out a flag, and that has been the case
at Washington and Lee for the past
four months. The leaves are return-
ing, but the flagpole at the head of
Lee Chapel parking lot has been flag-
less since the flag disappeared before
Christmas holidays.

The ROTC depariment has ad-
ministered the raising and lowering of
the flag every day for several years;
but because the flag is now missing,
when a new flag is received the
Maintenance Department will assume
the duty.

While not necessarily blaming WAL
students, ROTC officials believe the
absconding of the flag is a “black
eye’ for the school. And if this a
prank it is an expensive one, as the
flag was storm-proof and cost well
over $100.

The last reported raising of the flag
was on December 16 and it is be-
lieved it was taken that day.

centers of Europe, the capitol city,
and thus the seat of most government
agencies, and the communications and
transport center of France (all roads
lead to Paris).

Out of Control

The growth of Paris is as it ever
has been—out of control. Cars jam
the sireets for most of the working
day—one day iast fall there was mas-
sive tie-up near the Etoile from neon
to 6 p.m. some cars were promenad-
ing with the pedestrians along the
sidewalk. others were abandoned in
mid-siream in favor of a cool glass
of wine. The papers were estimating
a number above which the quantity
of ‘voitures’ in town could not rise—
something like 450,000: they estimat-
ed that after this point no car would
be moving—all activity would halt,
like at absolute zero. They finally got
some gas to the fellow who had run
dry, however, and it gradually thinned
oul.

Making Space

Everybody who is anybody, and a
lot who aren't. lust for a ear, or if
they have one, for a more powerful
one. It is said, with some degree of
accuracy. that a Frenchman cares
for his car first and then his wife
The combination of this lust with the
ever increasing ability of Parisians to
afford tuxuries yields an impossible
competition for parking places, Half
the drivers of the never-ending
plethora of cars are undoubtedly ex-
tremely angry individuals who have
been looking for a space for the past
45 minutes

The ingenious driver often solves
this problem in a most efficient way

if there isn’t a space, he makes one

Baseballers Open Season;
Bow To Ohio U., 8-1

By LARRY HILLIARD

Two Ohio University pitchers held
Washington and Lee to three hits and
posted an 8-1 vic-
tory in a practice
game yesterday.
The game was the
final scrimmage for
the Generals be-
fore their season
opener with Castle-
ton State College

 

of Vermont on
Friday.
The Generals

opened the scor-
ing in the bottom
of the second. With one out, Herbert
McCrystal singled and Charlie Freret
walked. After Jack Baizley had fore-
ed Freret for the second out, the
Generals pulled off a double steal,
with Baizley moving to second and
McCrystal scoring.

Ohio U. took the lead in the fourth
when the W&L pitcher, co-Captain
Bill Rasmussen, encountered control
difficulty. A walk, hit batsman, walk,
single, and sacrifice fly accounted for
three runs. The visitor's eleven hit
attack added two runs in the fifth,
two in the seventh, and one in the

Coach Lyles

ninth. Meanwhile, the Generals could
/manage only

two more safties; a
single by Freret and a double by
McCrystal.

Three hurlers

toiled for WAL,

| Rasmussen allowed five runs and six
‘hits in five innings, Ed Mitchell two

runs and four hits in three frames,

and Don Bock a run and a hit in
the ninth.

Coach Joe Lyles feels that the
excellent competition provided by
Ohio should prepare the Generals for
the regular season. He was pleased
with the team’s defensive work, but
added that the Generals have to im-
prove their hitting. “We need more
mental concentration at the plate.”

Friday’s home game will begin at
3:15. Afterwards, the team will de-
part for its Florida trip. The players
are giving up their Spring vacation—
hopefully a large number of students
will give up one afternoon to come
up to Smith Field and root for the
team.

Rumor of Football
Transfer Proves To

Be Un-verifiable

Recently the Ring-tum Phi sports

staff learned of a rumor thal was
spreading throughout certain circles

of WAL: that the above-pictured
athlete from Arizona State was con
sidering transfering to WAL. Of
course our initial response was cla
tion, for it has been many a yeat
since the Generals boasted a 61",
260 pound defensive middle guard
who possesses 18’, inch biceps. In
addition to his football talents he also
boasted a win over Granville Liggens
in regular season wrestling last year

However, we were cautious, and

| decided to check this matter through

the powers that be. The result was

{| HICKMAN’S ESSO |

Ball Performs In Nationals

Billy Ball scored a substantial 16th
and 17th in the 100- and 200-yard
backstroke events last weekend at the
college division NCAA swimming
championships at Atlanta.

In the 100-yard backstroke event,
Ball had a time of 57.78 seconds (an
electronic timer) which is his best

time ever. Ball came in 16th out of |

the 50 swimmers entered in this event.
The winning time was 52.9, and Ball
missed All-American status (finishing
in the top 12) by .25 seconds as the
twelth-place time was 57.53 seconds.
This was a good second faster than
Ball’s 58.6 performance in the CAC.

Ball scored a 2:09.5 in the 200-
yard backstroke, bettering his previous
best time by 21% seconds. This is
faster than Ball’s 2:11.9 time which
set a new CAC record. Ball finished
17th out of 42 entries and again miss-
ed All--American by .8 seconds while
the winning time in this event was a
fast 2:01.0.

The 400-yard individual medley
team of Billy Ball, Pat Costello, David
Kympton and Ross Forman did not
fare as well. They had a 3:57.6 time
while the highest qualifying time was
3:47.0. In fact, they were even above
their CAC conference record time of
3:54.5.

This was the final event in a swim-

| ming season that saw the Generals

capture the College Athletic Con-
ference swimming championship, and

tory over West Virginia University.
Coach Stearns has high hopes for
next year’s team, as there will be a

to elect their captain for next year,
The only seniors being graduated are
the two co-captains, Pat Costello and
Noel Clinard. Clinard provided many

Pictman Leads Offense As W&L

Lacrosse Team Stuns Dartmouth

By BUZZ PACOCHA

Washington and Lee’s varsity la-
crosse team defeated a ragged Dart-
mouth squad in a scrimmage yester-
day by a 6-4 score. The Generals’
scoring was well divided with Tom
Pittman leading the way with two
goals and one assist.

Coach Szlassa was well pleased with
the Generals’ performance, especially
with the work of Pittman and Chew,
hoth of whom moved well in their
attack positions. Sziasa also noted the
fine g=me turned in by Dave Johnson
in the goal, and the job of “riding”
done by the W&L attackmen who
kept Dartmouth defense from moving

Szlasa expects his team to perform
well this season, hoping to catch a

Saturday. Co-captains Griffin and
Stewart provide strong leadership and
lots of hustle, while the injured Bart
Goodwin's return is expected to shore
up the midfielders,

This year’s schedule is a typically
rough one, with much stronger com-

Costello was defeated only once all

stroke. He now holds the CAC record
in the 200-yard breaststroke.

Of the swimmers traveling to At-

They were unable to go for various
reasons. Brumback, a freestyle ace,
was out for the lacrosse team.

‘The lady (man?) doth protest too much’

 

The silent advocates of peace left their traditional home in front of the Evans Dining Hall in their most recent
vigil. They paraded themselves through downtown Lexington. Assorted townsmen were quite amused at W&L’s
‘hippies’ and wondered why Martin Luther King was not there to lead the civil rights parade.

Our latest count credits these mongers of peace with two very silent vigils. But even though they have not, as of
yet, started any rioting, the presence of the 30 or so pacifists of the student body and the faculty has tied up the
traflic of sojourning students traveling back form lunch.

Would that Lady Bird would sign up for a ‘silent’ vigil, and that we could be so lucky as to keep her that way.

The Committee also
hundred questionnaires to prominent
Republicans: congressmen, senators,
and state delegation chairmen. The
responses to these questionnaires have
also helped the Platform Committee
determine likely issues.

Last week, sub-committee hear-

students who had been in touch with
their state delegations appeared be-
fore the various sub-committees and
presented their respective states’ views
on platform issues. The sub-commit-

committee chairmen then presented
their material to the Platform Com-

A first draft will be drawn up

building roads that terminate in the

SIPA Convention Convenes Here

While Students Are On Vacation

By PAT AREY

Ah Spring! When a young man’s
fancy turns to .. . well, would you
believe the Southern Interscholastic
Press Association convention?

The SIPA (pronounced SEE-PAH)
convention will open its 39th session
on the W&L campus next Friday. The
convention has been sponsored since
1925 by the University’s Lee Me-
morial Journalism Foundation,

About 1,200 high school journalism
students and advisors will attend the
two day convention.

The leading speaker this year will
be Charles McDowell, syndicated
columnist and Washington corres-
pondent for the Richmond Times-Dis-

Spring Vacation

Spring holidays will begin tomor-
row at | p.m. and last until Monday,
April 8, when classes resume at 8:25
am,

Absences for all students before
and after the holidays are limited to
students on the Dean's List; to those
on the semester and midsemster honor

rolls; and to seniors in their last
semester who are applicants for their
degrees, if they do not need more

than 15 semster hours and 30 grade-
points to be graduated, and if they
have a cumulative gradepoint ratio of
at least 2.00 and a gradepoint ratio
of at least 2.00 on the work of the
preceding semester

 

patch. McDowell, who has also
authored several books (“( ‘ampaign
Fever,” Morrow, 1965; “What Did

You Have in Mind?”), is a graduate
of Washington and Lee.

McDowell will speak at the open-
ing convention session Friday morn-
ing in Doremus Gymnasium. All gen-
eral sessions will be open to the
public.

Richard L. Tobin, managing edi-
tor of the Saturday Review, will also
speak at the convention. He is an
author, newspaperman and commenta-
tor. He served with the New York
Herald Tribune for 24 years as re-
porter, editor, and editorial writer
before joining the Saturday Review
in 1961.

Tobin has covered national politi-
cal conventions, served as a war cor-
respondent and worked in the Eisen-
hower and Nixon presidential cam-
paigns. He will speak Saturday at
12:05 p.m. in Lee Chapel on “Mass
Communications: Pattern for Pro-
gress.”

Aside from the speeches by Tobin
and McDowell, a series of short
classes and workshops will be con-
ducted for the SIPA delegates. The
subjects will include all aspect of
secondary school journalism—news-
papers, magazines, photography, year-
books, and radio work,

About 14 WAL students will be on
campus during the weekend to help
run the convention

Yelling at the top of their voices,
17 W&L students competed Tuesday
in Doremus Gymnasium for the posi-
tion of Clerk of the Rolls in the up-
coming Mock Convention. The posi-
tion is one of utmost importance,
for the Clerk of the Rolls is the
person who announces the states and
the number of votes per state for each
candidate at the Convention, A very
loud voice is required plus a voice

 

with clarity of pronunciation.

Bystanders included several  stu-
dents, many whose sporting activities
were interrupted by the constant
shouting .The judges for the trials
were W&L faculty members who
were located on the indoor track at
the opposite side of the gym from
the contestants,

Much to the disappointment of the
contestants, live pigs were not used to
provide background noise. However,

 

: >
the taped background noise of the
1964 Mock Convention was used.

This proved to be a most adequate
substitute for the pigs.

The 17 contestants, all students,
first read a roll of ten states. After
the students “blew” their lungs, the
judges made their first elimination.

They chose the six they thought
were the best to compete in the sec-
ond trials,

By REED BYRUM

The Washington and Lee School of
Law is now “actively considering”
changing its present degree from an
L.L.B., Bachelor of Laws, to a J.D.,
Juris Doctor. Both, however, are
quivalent professional degrees.

William and Mary, University of
Chicago, Emory University, and West
Virginia University are among the
law schools now granting the J.D.
degree to their graduates, Currenily,
about one-third of the nation’s law
schools offer the J.D.

The Juris Doctor was begun in the
early 1900's at the University of
Chicago by Professor Joseph Beale,
the first dean of the law school there.

Dean Charies P. Light, acting head
of the law school, stated “Ever

The judges also decided that Paul

Some Sigma Nu’'s at the competi-

by saying they allowed George to

More Courses
In Theater Art

Recommended

The committee on Courses and
Degrees Tuesday recommended that
the number of course offerings in
theater and dramatics be increased.

This action was taken at the sug-
gestion of Mr. Lee Kahn, fine arts
instructor and director of the Trouba-
dour Theater.

Committee Chairman William W.
Pusey, Dean of the College, said that
the fina] decision rested with the
faculty as a whole. The next faculty
meeting is Monday, April 8.

Mr. Kahn's target date for imple-
mentation is the fall of 1969, pro-
vided the faculty approves.

The administration has in the past
also affirmed its intention to build
a new theater to replace facilities now
in use.

No Defense, No Redress

“Every faculty member should be a good academic
citizen, loyal to the University with freedom of thought
and expression, ready to co-operate with other faculty
members, willing to share committee work and admin-
istrative responsibility and to represent the University
to outside organizations, academic and/or civic. He must
be an individual of intellectual integrity, whose state-
ments shall merit the trust and authority accorded his
position,”

—University-Wide Policy

SX

The appearance of a letter in this news-
paper recently alleging unfair grading prac-
tices on the part of a professor here, and the
publication last week of an underground sheet
attacking a number of other professors, has
made apparent a very serious and potentially
unpleasant problem in an area of W&L life
which has traditionally been placid—faculty-
student relationships.

Few would deny, we think, that the faculty
and the attitudes towards education which it
represents is one of the most successful fea-
tures at W&L. Students here from freshmen
on up are granted opportunities for close
working relationships with their teachers which
are inconceivable at most major universities.
The student-teacher ratio is maintained at ap-
proximately 12 to 1. Emphasis very definitely
is placed upon teaching, rather than upon re-
search. No W&L student spends his first two
years studying under graduate students, as
happens frequently at larger universities. In
most courses, teachers can and do spend time
with individual students, pursuing the indi-
vidual student’s interests, and ironing out in-
dividual problems. It is a rare situation in an
American college when a department chair-
man is as easily available for consultation with
students as the lowliest visiting lecturer. Not
surprisingly, both faculty and administration
point to such attitudes with pride, and en-
courage them.

But what happens to the student when
something goes wrong? If a faculty member
were to willfully grade a student down because
of “poor attitude,” where would the student
go for redress? If another teacher should
average out a student’s grades and then drop
them by two letters, where does that leave the
student? To whom can a student appeal when
his professor “refuses to discuss the incident”
or “sees no purpose in argument’? The an-
swer to these questions, as any student who
has ever been in the situation is well aware,
is that at W&L there is no redress, no defense,
and no place to appeal to.

Ww

Teachers in ancient and medieval times
were paid directly by their students, so it was
good business policy for them to be both
interesting and fair. The modern university
has made the teacher independent of stu-
dent control, thereby giving him his right to
be dull, without limiting his right to be un-
fair. At W&L, as at many other colleges, the
right to be unfair has been erected into a
fixed principle.

If this seems difficult to believe, then we
might examine a couple of hypothetical cases,
which, however, have grounds in actual oc-
currences on this campus. Imagine that Stu-
dent X has received a C in a three-hour course,
after having made grades which he feels cer-
tain entitle him to an A or at least a B. Sup-
pose, too, that for whatever reasons the teach-
er in question refuses to discuss the subject
any further than to say, “A large number of
factors went into your grade.” If student X,
unlike most students, chooses not to accept
this, he may then approach the dean of the
appropriate school with his grievance. here,
Student X receives a hearing on the express
condition that nothing whatever can be done
to alter grades which have already been re-
corded—it being the teacher's prerogative to
give grades as he chooses. Accepting this con-
dition immediately removes Student X's whole

purpose in being there, and leaves him with

the option of pursuing the issue to no tangible
goal, or of giving up the whole affair as a
bad job. The teacher retains the right to act
and grade as he wishes. The student retains

the C.

Or take Student Y, the member of a
campus organization directed by a faculty
member or official. Following the publiciz-
ing of certain thoughtful but critical remarks
about the organization, Student Y is removed
from his position in it without explanation,
and then expelled from the organization
altogether. In this case, there is not even a
dean for him to appeal to.

Ww

The problem as we have stated it is not
exaggerated. It is actually made worse by the
refusal of those most concerned—the faculty
—to recognize it as a problem. An examina-
tion of the 460-page “Self-Study Report” of
1964-66 indicated that that massive and care-
ful self-examination suggested not one word
on the subject. To a majority of professors
and administrators, the mere possibility of
unfairness on the part of another professor
is inconceivable; judging their colleagues by
themselves, they automatically assume that
every student with a grievance has either mis-
understood the facts or is only pursuing a
personal vendetta. They react with amusement
to the idea that a student can possibly be in
a position to judge of a mature professor’s
actions. And they react with shock and anger
to any student who tries to press his case.

This blindness is mistaken and potentially
dangerous. The absence of any apparatus
for the correction of grievances at this uni-
versity leads naturally to considerable bitter-
ness on the part of the students concerned,
and gives respectability to underground satire
of the cheapest quality. As conditions are now,
a serious and moderate student, if he finds
himself in a situation which he honestly con-
siders unjust, is forced into the position either
of weakly acquiescing or of raising a public
outcry—neither of them really satisfactory
alternatives. The best course, a quiet and fair
inquiry into the case, is simply not open.

Frankly, we don’t know where the answer
to the problem lies. We rather doubt that any
organization made up solely of students could
handle such a delicate job, or that its decisions
and recommendations would receive much
consideration within the faculty. Perhaps some
faculty group could take the job, although
we suspect that very few teachers would like
to have to sit in judgement on their colleagues.
Perhaps, as at some other colleges, there
could be someone along the lines of the
“ombudsman,” an officer directly respon-
sible to the president, with the duty of investi-
gating student grievances of this nature; but
then, it is difficult to imagine anyone wanting
to play the Devil’s advocate. He would tend
to be somewhat unpopular. Some apparatus
needs to be found to execute some policy
which neither displays a cool and suspicious
attitude toward all student complaints, nor
limits by inquisition the teacher's proper free-
dom of action. The consideration of what form
such an apparatus should take, and the policy
it should pursue, should be the job of both
faculey and students during the very near
future.

What is more important for the present,
however, is that members of the faculty and
administration recognize that the problem
does in fact exist; that to ignore it further is
to invite increasingly unpleasant incidents; and
that their cherished freedom of action cannot
be made the excuse for arbitrary and unfair
practices—practices against which at the pres-
ent time the student has no defense. Once
this recognition is made, then a major part
of the problem will have taken care of itself.
And positive action, we hope, would follow.

After a break of eight years (“due
to unsettled conditions in 1920 no
interest was taken in the matter and
it passed by without action on the
parts of the students”—Ring-tum Phi,
April 19, 1924), Washington and Lee’s
Mock Democratic Convention was
revived in 1924.

The faculty voted to declare a one-
day holiday for the revived conven-
tion; the Ring-tum Phi billed the
issue as having “Action [that] will
be taken to make the trial as realistic
as possible, a serious occasion under-
towed with humor, and make be-
lieve.”

The fourth Mock Convention was
called to order at 3:30 p.m. on May
14, 1924. Thirteen candidates were
nominated, including ex-Secretary of

 

the Treasury William G. McAdoo,
Governor of New York Al Smith,
1920 Democratic Candidate James
N. Cox, Senate Minority Leader Oscar
Underwood, and ex-Ambassador to
Britain and President of the Ameri-
can Bar Association John W. Davis.

A floor debate developed over
inclusion of a prohibition article in
the platform. “The wet element,

wines and beer as part of the party
platform clashed with the pro-

Letters To The Editor ...

 

 

To the Editor:

The Tuesday Edition’s snide, smug
commentary on last Friday's Viet-
nam demonstration represents a high
standard of journalistic objectivity
not equaled since President Johnson's
State of the Union message was cov-
ered in Komsomolskaya-Pravda,

In their clumsy, club-footed attempt
at humor, by placing a cute caption
and precious headline around the
photograph of last Friday's demonstra-
tors, they demonstrate an intolerance
that is unbecoming and slightly un-
ehical. What's more, it was wreich-
edly poor humor.

I am not in sympathy with the

 

viewpoint of the demonstrators, Nev-

I write to correct an error in the
Tuesday Edition. A flippant Tuesday
Edition writer asserted that last Pri
day's peace vigil and parade proved
“the presence of 30 or so pacifists
in the student body and faculty.” It
proved nothing of the sort. Opposing
a particular war does not qualify a
person as a pacifist, Pacifists oppose
wars in general

U; nderground Paper

Criticizes Teachers
By RON KESSLER

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw left Lex-
ington Thursday to go to a wedding.
When he returned on Sunday, he
learned that his name was in the
news.

The “news” appeared in an em-
bryonic thing called “Notes from
Underground.” A boxed item at the
top of the legal-sized page stated:

“This paper is dedicated to provid-
ing a public media for the contro-
versial.”

With this, “Notes from Under-
ground” sliced into five professors.
“Tenure Breeds Senility” read the
headline, prominently placed at the
top of page one,

Age is thus equated with incompet-
ance.

“Our faculty,” says “Notes from
Underground” has a few members
whose tenure at the University has
meant that they no longer convey
intellectual vitality to their courses.”

Five stories about five professors
follow. The stories are cute. They
are even funny. They don’t indicate
senlity, though. Nor do they indi-
cade a “lack of intellectual vitality,”
to quote from “Notes from Under-
ground.” They're just cute. And
funny.

But the headline is there: “Tenure
Breeds Senility.” In capital letters.
Thus, according to “Notes from Un-
derground,” five professors are senile.

Not everyone agrees with “Notes
from Undeground.” After all, “Notes
from Underground” is dedicated to
the “controversial.”

So, A Protest appeared. Mimeo-
graphed, distributed throughout the
campus, the Protest asserted.

“It is obvious that the author
of that statement has never taken
one of Dr. Crenshaw's courses.

Movie Review:
‘Dr. Zhivago’

By STEPHEN JOHNSON

David Lean has learned how to
make films beautifully, tastefully,
painstakingly, even perfectly, And
these all hold, provided that no one
strenuously questions the character or
disposition of the beauty, the quality
of the taste, the focus or result of
the painstaking patience, the worth or
purpose of the perfection. “Doctor
7hivago,” under David Lean's direct
ion, is this sort of perfect film

I am sick unto death at seeing this
kind of self<lestructive love for and
pride in absolutely controlled and ab
solutely worthless effect, at seeing all
manner of skill and devotion used in
nothing whatsoever; it is as if all the
power of the language of Shakespeare
and Milton were to culminate in the
prose of “The Saturday Evening Post.’

The film is generally praised for its
photography. And it is praise-worthy

as photography, a subject which is
to be understood as something sepa

The patient suffers from a persecu-
tion complex. He feels that someone
is out to “get” him. He reads un-
founded meanings into the things
written about him. He feels that he
is right and the others wrong, and,
consequently, he gets mad. The other
person, seeing that things are getting
out of perspective, pulls up short and
attempts to scrutinize the situation,

So what's all the b.s. about? No,
we are not reviewing the Caine
Mutiny. The above paragraph just
about describes the feelings of the
Athletic Department towards the Fri-
day Sports Page, and I, as Friday
Sports Editor, feel that it is neces-
sary that these feelings be analyzed
and some conclusions reached.

Policy Statement

In my Opening column back in the
fall, 1 stated that I hoped to help
“put athletic awareness and team pride
back into the student body of Wash-
ington and Lee.” | spoke of the
merits of “athletics in an unsubsidiz-
ed environment” and hypothesized,
rather idealistically perhaps, about
the future of athletics at this Uni-
versity. That column, I felt, set the
tone for the 1967-68 edition of Fri-
day Sports.

I feel that, to the best of my
ability, I have not deviated from this
goal, and this is where I and the

A View In Perspective
Of Dore

Athletic Department disagree. While
pledging myself to the athletes of
Washington and Lee, I said nothing
about my obligation to their coaches
and to the Department in general.
Many of the coaches have failed to
make the distinction, and therein lies
the rub.

If desubsidization at W&L created
no other great distinctions, it did
separate coaches from players in a
way different from before. The ama-
teur replaced the professional on the
athletic field, but the professiona!
coach remained. He was still getting
paid to do a job, and his success was
still measured in the yardstick of the
past—the won-lost column.

Weeding The Garden

With the change in the basic athletic
philosophy at the University, coaches
who could not see themselves fitting
into the new pattern were gradually
replaced by those that would accept
the new status quo. These are basic-
ally the coaches that today comprise
the Athletic Department, and I firmly
believe that they all, in viewing the
overall picture of the University, be-
lieve in unsubsidized athletics at
Washington and Lee. These men are
sincere men who are 100 per cent
for their boys and, most of the time,
like Caesar’s wife, they are above
reproach.

But one would have to be blind
not to recognize that things are not
all smiles in the Athletic Department.
While perhaps a little harsh, the
“Sumerod” story in the Tuesday Edi-
tion of a few weeks back was a fair

Thunder’s Theories

 

By THUNDER THORNTON
Friday Sports Columnist

Somedays there’s nothing to eat

| but crow.

Last week UCLA showed the na-
tion who is really number one in
college basketball. The tournament
is the best way to provide proof of
such a statement, and the Bruins fifty-
five points worth of evidence (their
total margin in the two final round
games at Los Angeles) was certainly
enough to make me a believer,

I recall settling down before the
tube last Friday expecting to see a
tightly contested game between the
field’s two stalwarts, Houston and
UCLA. In my ignorance, I even gave
the Cougars a chance to win, dis-
regarding the fact that they had lost
a big man in their plans, George
Reynolds, as just a challenge to make
the game more interesting.

It was interesting. Most of that
interest was generated in wondering

 

|| how this Houston team could have

| beaten the west coast boys before.
| True, the circumstances were dif-
| ferent. In the previous game UCLA
| had played with a half-speed Lew
Alcindor and suffered through a poor
| shooting night. Also, the loss of
| Reynolds hurt the Cougars to a cer-
tain degree. But after watching the
Bruins sprint out to as much as

Stickmen ‘To Meet Dutchmen Tomorrow
With New Coach And Surprising Depth

An experienced defense, an attack |
led by All-America candidate Chip)

Chew, and a midfield loaded with
depth will characterize Washington
and Lee University’s lacrosse team
when the Generals open a nine-game
schedule this Saturday at Hofstra Uni-
versity.

Under new head coach Dick Szlasa,
a former All-America at Maryland,
WAL will send 12 lettermen against
the Flying Dutchmen, that itself a
signal the Generals should be and
will be a better club this season.

At one time, though, right around
the start of pre-season drills, there
were some doubts W&L would be able
to field a squad competitive with its
opponents.

Lyles And Company Head South

 

A lack of consistency, difficulties
in picking up assignments, and a
minimum of unity were the chief
culprits.

“We were having our troubles,”
says Szlasa, “but we feel we ironed
out most of them in our scrimmages.
We made progress all along, to the
point where we now think we are
ready to go.”

The Generals met Adelphi, Ohio
State, Yale, and Dartmouth in a series
of controlled scrimmages over the
past two weeks. In each event, Szlasa
stopped action when he felt his
charges needed a little inspiration.

“We went over our mistakes then
and there,” says Szlasa, “and it was
probably the best thing we could have

 

 

In Search For Winning Season

Washingion and Lee University’s
eager baseball squad, which has not
experienced a winning season in seven
years, will be seeking to change that
format this time around when the
Generals take to the road next week
for Spring Vacation games in the
Sunshine State against Florida Pres-
byterian, St. Leo's, and the University
of Tampa.

With lettermen sprinkled just about
everywhere, 13 of them, head coach
Joe Lyles’ outfit is at its best strength
in years, thanks in part to the return
of all three outfielders and a con-
struction job in the infield that makes
that area tops in defense,

“We're definitely looking for bet-
ter fortunes,” says Lyles. “We have
a solid outfield with juniors Jim Wil-
son in left, co-captain Thom Mitchell
in center, and Charlie Freret in right.

“Each one can handle a bat well,
and that’s going to take a lot of pres
sure off our pitchers,” adds Lyles

and batting in 1S runs

haven't had for some time.”

Lyles’ main concern is with his
pitching staff, a corps that includes
only a few veterans. Senior co-captain
Bill Rasmussen, a righthander, leads
the group which includes junior port-
sider Lee Halford, senior righthander
Ed Mitchell, and freshman southpaw
John Botcheller.

“We could use some more help,”
says Lyles, “especially from a left-
hander or two, Maybe a couple will
come out of the woodwork at mid-
season.”

For the time being, though, enough
outstanding personnel exist so that
Lyles finally can hope for his first
winning season since the ‘61 Generals

The scrimmages
was particularly strong at defense,
where lettermen Charlie Stewart, a
junior, and seniors Harold Stowe,
Holmes Raker, and goalie Dave
Johnson appear set for opposing at-
tackmen.

Johnson has held a starting assign-
ment in the nets for the past three
years, so his experience there should
have a guiding influence on his mates
up the field.

Stewart, Stowe and Raker each have
the size necessary for a defenseman,
which combined with their savvy
makes for a dependable trio help-
ing to protect Johnson.

Perhaps the most improved aspect
of the Generals’ scrimmage play was
attack, a spot where senior Chip
Chew seems to have taken command.
Chew was impressive in every con-
test, often beating his man to score

would have benefitted from the best
guard in the country as a replace-
ment for Reynolds.

It was a question of too much
talent packed into the blue and gold
uniforms of UCLA. Coach John
Wooden has roamed the nation over
to assembly possibly the strongest col-
lege basketball team ever. Of con-
temporary (post 1950) squads that
have dominated NCAA play, none
seem to have put five players on the
florr to match UCLA’s lineup. San
Francisco had Bill Russell and K. C.
Jones, Cincinnati had Paul Hogue,
Ron Bonham, and Tom Thacker, but
the fivesome of Warren, Allen, Shack-
leford, Lynn, and Alcindor seems to
come as close to a “dream team” as
a mortal coach can recruit.

An example of the team strength
that the Californians possess is the
way the Big E, Elvin Hayes, was
shackled. It was not Alcindor, but
Mike Lynn, who did the defensive
job that turned Hayes, who had been
a tiger in the Astrodome, into just
another ballplayer. So good was Lynn,
the “fifth” man on the team who
probably is a little less well known
than his four teammates, that Edgar
Lacey, a member of the Gail Good-
rich-led UCLA champs, had to find
a new place to display his wares.
Apparently Lacey was a mere mortal,
thereby not fitting into Coach Wood-
en’s lineup of supermen.

Gentlemen, the Friday Sports Page
is by no means against your pro-

feels to be the best in intercollegiate
athletics in this country today. To
be against them would mean being
against the student-athletes that repre-

never be.

But, gentlemen, you yourselves are
being paid by the student body to do
a job. You are in the public eye, and
the organ of this eye—the W&L stu-
dent newspaper—reserves the right to
take you to task whenever it feels
circumstances deem this necessary.
The Friday Ring-tum Phi does not
measure you by your won-lost rec-

on the University community. Sin-
cere dedication and honest effort will
always be commended in print, but
actions to the contrary of the spirit
of athletics at this University (which
undeniably have been committed in
the past) will not go unnoticed.

As long as you are behind the
ideals of this University, in relations
with your athletes, the student body
as a whole, and with each other, this
sports page will be behind you. But
do not think that things will be with-

“On the twenty-second ballot,
following a plea for harmony from

Ohio, and Connecticut delegations

semblage into an uproar. After a
heated discussion and arbitration,
the insurgent faction reappeared

the next ballot the Hon. John W.

(Ring-tum Phi—May 17).

Davis was an alumnus of Washing-
ton and Lee, class of 1892. An edi-
torial in the May 17 Ring-tum Phi
asserted, “any deprecatory comment

posed to an L.L.B. Secondly, it gives
appropriate recognition to those who
go to graduate school the same num-
ber of years as a medical or a dental
student. The graduate law student re-
ceives only a bachelor’s degree, while
the others are granted a M.D. or a
D.D.S. for a similar amount of time
and effort.

The confusion that would exist in
the change-over from an L.L.B. to a
J.D. is the main argument opposing
the Juris Doctor degree. It would pri-
marily be misunderstood as the post-
graduate law degree of SJ.D. or
J.S.D.; the latter are awarded only
after post-graduate study is done by
the student and are of greater signifi-
cance than the professional degrees.
Secondarily, the sequence of degrees
given by those schools which use the
L.L.B. program would be confused by
a J.D. A person with a doctorate
would end up in post-graduate work-
ing for his master's degree, an L.L.M.,
causing a complete reversal of terms
and degrees in significance.

McDowell Says Racial Problems
Will Take A Political Solution

By DON HUSAT

Charles R. McDowell, Jr.. Wash-
ington correspondent for the Rich-
mond “Times-Dispatch and syndi-
cated columnist, said yesterday that
the ultimate solution to the racial
problems in this country iwil be
found in the political system. Speak-

McDowell |

Association convention,

made reference to the death of Dr.

Martin Luther King, Jr., saying that |

his death “has more tragic dimensions
than have yet been realized.” He said
the former Nobel Peace Price Win-
ner was an apostle of non-violence,
holding desperately “to control the
potential chaos of the irresponsible.”

*

McDowell said that for the present
time, he would be willing to settle
for remembering the incredible things
Martin Luther King did for his peo-
ple, and the ideals for which he
stood. “For those who don't agree
with King’s goals, he said, “we can
try to imagine what he meant to
his people.”

“Such a public adult educational

Prof. O. W. Riegel presented three
Distinguished Service Awards at the
39th annual SIPA Awards Luncheon
today. The tradition of awarding ad-
visers and other outstanding journ-
alists certificates was initiated in 1954
but was discontinued in 1963, Many
outstanding names are on the perma-
nent plaques and include several per-
sons still active in scholastic journ-
alism and in SIPA. The keynote
speaker, Charles R. McDowell, Jr.
was awarded a Distinguished Service
Award as was Charles E. Savedge,
one of this year’s judges.

In awarding Mrs, Ruby Lee Norris
one of this year’s certificates Prof.
Riegel cited her as “a symbol of the
enormous usefulness of the dedicated
Virginia teacher who extends her in-
fluence beyond the classroom and,
through her interest and skill in
scholastic publishing, becomes a warm
friend and wise counsellor of our
young people.” Mrs, Norris was gradu-
ated from Mary Washington College
and has taught English at several Vir-
ginia high schools. While at John
Marshall High School she was the
adviser to the Marshallite and when
at George Wythe High School she
was adviser to The Chancellor. Under
her guidance The Chancellor won the
top awards given by all of the ma-
jor press associations.

In addition she has helped with
SIPA throughout her career both as
a judge and as a member of the
Executive Council.

The second Distinguished Service
Award was presented to Cecile R.
Goodall. In making the presentation
Prof. Riegel cited her for her out-
standing service to high schools in
Kanawha County, West Virginia. Not
only is she an outstanding teacher
but she also has served as a “per-
ceptive critic of yearbooks for the
Southern Interscholastic Press As-
sociation.” Prof. Riegei ended by cit-
ing her “as a progressive force and
contributor to the civic life of her
community and state.”

The final Distinguished Service
Award went to Abe D. Jones, Jr.
Mr. Jones is a member of the editorial
staff of the Greensboro News-Record,
Mr. Jones graduated from Washing-
ton and Lee University in 1951 and
was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in
that year. He is a member of the
North Carolina Editorial Writers’
Conference, and he chaired the con-
ference in 1963. He also is a mem-
ber of the National Conference of
Editorial Writers. Professor Riegel
cited him for his help in organizing
and running the Southern Inter-
scholastic Press Association

SIPA presents the Distinguished
Service Award an a attempt to
recognize the unselfish efforts of the
many advisers to scholastic newspap-
ers and yearbooks. The efforts of
these individuals are largely extra-
curicular, but through their guidance

as

they not only bring honor to their
school but they start many young
journalists off on the right foot. Not
all those who deserve awards are
recognized, but these three awards
afe symbolic of the appreciation of
the Southern Interscholastic Press

Association to all of those who have
worked so hard over the years for the

Association and for their respective

schools

Judges Too

Suffer Mixed Emotions

By COL, CHARLES E, SAVEDGE,
(The role of the SIPA judge as seen by Col. Charles E, Savedge,

yearbook judge and adviser to the

is used here as an introduction to a judge’s eye-view of SIPA.—Ed.)

Too often when 9:20 rolls around on Saturday mornings at SIPA, judges
for the “contests” end up feeling as if they are a breed apart from the rest
of mankind, But judges are human. And this means that they suffer when
they have to give low grades just as teachers do when their students fail

to live up to the mark.

SIPA sets guidelines for judges a
books according to these guidelines.
five hours in going over each book,

drawing diagrams, and really sweating over the most diplomatic way of say-
ing that a book can be done better—better for the school, the students, and

the faculty.

And judges are human when they see books which have received care,
nurture, affection, and enthusiasm from their staffs. They are quick to note
the book which stands out because of the use of the English language and
there are several books which are entered at SIPA which would make any
“All American” team for the way in which they have been written. Gen-
erally those books which have good copy, body, captions and headlines, are
the ones which also have layouts which are modern, exciting, and clean
and they are the books which feature imaginative photography.

In ten years of judging, there have been fantastic changes. The most

noticeable is the dropping of “who's
will and testaments. In several groups,

in others, only one or two are now still clinging to these old fashioned trivia.
Photography has improved at least 100 per cent as staffs try to use the
lens as a photo-journalistic device. But the greatest advance has been in the
copy field. Yearbooks now are truly history books of one full year and as

such, they are mirroring the vitality,

for the period. Even ten years ago staffs seldom bothered about covering
the faculty except with outdated “mug” shots. Today, the faculty are shown

Even today there is a movement towards more fluid layouts, more clean-

Books in SIPA do not have to take a backseat to any section of the
country. Just as parts of Indiana, Texas, Arizona, and Michigan are hotbeds
of good modern journalism, so are books from Virginia, North A arolina,
Georgia, and Florida. So judges go on, gaining gray hairs, worrying about

SIPA Depends
On Secretaries
For Efficiency

Without Mrs. W. M. Hinton and
Mrs. Jay Cook SIPA would be much
less efficient and might even fail to
come off. Mrs, Hinton is secretary
for executive director of SIPA Pro-
fessor Charles Winston, and during
the SIPA convention she acts as an
administrative assistant. Mrs. Cook is
a newcomer to the full SEPA staff,
but she took over the housing depart-
ment and has done a magnificant job,

Pre-Registration

Mrs. Hinton has been connected
to SIPA for several years, and with-
out her the entire convention might
be in a shambles. She keeps track of
all of the delegates and advisers who
are coming. She gets their name tags
ready and eliminates the numerous
errors that appear on entrance forms
by writing countless letters and ob-
taining the correct information. Be-
cause of her experience she is the
person the student staffers turn to
when things get out of hand. Mrs.
Hinton has the correct answer and
a smile to get the staffer back to
work confident of the fact that he
has the right solution.

Mrs. Cook took over the housing
department from Mrs. Paxton Davis
this year. She has found that it is
quite a problem but she has man-
aged to find all of the delegates
accomodations that seem to suit
them. Mrs. Cook also serves as secre-
tary for Professor O. W. Riegel,
director of SIPA since 1930. She has
been corresponding with the potential
judges and speakers since September,
and continued to get out last minute
communications until the convention
ended this afternoon.

Reception

Both Mrs. Hinton and Mrs. Cook
have worked for years with arrange-
ments for adviser facilities. Mrs. Cook
is the menu expert when it comes to
selection of menus for the two meals
served. She also is director of the
Advisers’ Reception held concurretnly
with the SIPA dance each year.

Last year Professor Winston credit-
ed Mrs. Hinton with “carrying” him
because he was a novice and she
was an experienced administrator of
SIPA. Even though he has a year's
experience under his belt Mr. Winston
said, “Mrs. Hinton is considerably
more than an administrative assistant.
Her patience, advice, and sincere in-
terest in SIPA contribute to an en-
thusiastic and well organized atmos-
phere in which to work.”

SIPA works well because of a lot
of hard work by a lot of people and
there is no denying that two of the
most important are Mrs. Hinton and
Mrs. Cook.

 

 

Davis To Head J

Two promotions and a novel ac-
count for significant changes over
last year for three SIPA directors.
Professor Riegel has reached the
age of compulsory retirement as de-

17 Judges Rate
SIPA Entries

The substance of the honors be-
stowed today depend directly on 17
judges. No matter how distinguished
the sponsors of SIPA may be the
entire worth of SIPA rests on the
quality of its judges.

Who are they?

Dr. Regis Boyle is chairman of
the department of journalism at
Catholic University. She founded the
department in 1942; she also directs
its Journalism Institute for High
School students each July. She is the
adviser to the University’s student
publications and to the school news-
paper at Walt Whitman High where
she teaches English and journalism.

She holds an AB from Trinity Col-
lege and has been a lecturer in
journalism and adviser to its paper.
Her MA and PhD are from Catholic
University. She has done post-doc-
toral work at Columbia University.

Winston Directs SIPA,
Teaches, Manages WLUR

The operation of SIPA for the past |
two years has rested mainly on the
shoulders of Charles E. Winston.
Mr. Winston is an instructor in the
school of journalism, manager of the
university radio station, WLUR-FM,
as well as executive director of SIPA.

Winston came to Washington and
Lee in the fall of 1966. He is a
graduate of the University of Mis-
souri where he received his bachelor
and Master’s degree in Journalism.
His home is in Denver, Colo,

Winston also spends much of the
day devoted to the programming
for station WLUR. It has just been
recently announced that he will re-
main at the university next year
with responsibility only for the sta-
tion. Professor John K. Jennings will
resume the post of executive direc-
tor of SIPA when he returns from
study at Stanford University in the
fall.

The operation and planning for
SIPA is not easy. As soon as one
convention is over, plans are made for
the next meeting. The meeting of all
members of the staff brings out points
needing improvement and further dis-
cussion. Thus one can say Mr. Wins-
ton has been working on SIPA since
last year’s convention ended. Dur-
ing the summer much of the litera- |
ture sent out in October and Novem- :
ber must be planned and printed. | South African Attends
Judges must be found and plans made |
to handle the great influx of materials
coming to Lexington.

In late November and December,
papers, yearbooks, magazines and
tapes come flowing in for criticism.
These must all be sorted, catalogued
and packed to be sent to the judges.
In this aspect as well as planning for
all parts of SIPA, Mr. Winston is
aided by Mrs. William Hinton.

After Christmas vacation the work
really begins in earnest. The activ-
ities are too numerous to mention.
Plans for entertainment, speakers,
classroom assignments, delegate hous-
ing, registration all must be made.
The little things must all be thought
of and accomplished. He really be-
gins to spend every moment with
SIPA at that time.

The planning is a difficult task and
ultimate responsibility rests with the
executive director. It is not a petty
job, but it must be done, Winston
does this as well as teaching a course
in television with one laboratory a

week in Roanoke. The day is not

long enough.

The operation of an efficient and
smooth convention is his responsi-
bility, and the past three days have

 

out a spring vacation of any kind.

ing Hickory High School, Claremont,

ceptionally friendly. Transfeldt, who

ed thought the short courses and the
program in general were “very good,”
complaints and suggestions for im-

Overcrowding, especially in the
short courses, was the most common
complaint. One delegate remarked,
“I went to five sessions and only got
to sit down at two.” He was far
from the only one with tired feet.

Advisers and short course instruc-
tors suggested that this problem might
be reduced if more courses were
offered at a given period or if very
popular courses were scheduled more
than once.

One adviser blamed the crowding
to poor planning. He said advisers

Non-Violent Life
Ends In Violence

Constitution we hold asthe

The SIPA edition of the
Ring-tum Phi does not usually
comment on topics outside of
the realm of our convention,
but, we feel the death of Dr.
Martin Luther King demands
some comment to a convention
of journalists,

The mood of the nation at
this time is very tense. The
feeling of the public is influ-
enced by the actions of what
seems to be a single man. The
ideal of non-violent protest is
in great challenge at this
moment. The non-violence
which Dr. King stood for is
lost in the expressions of griefs.

The role of the journalist
at this time is very important,
especially the role of the scho-
lastic journalist, The role of
non-violent demonstration is
formed in the teen year, and
we must guide the philosophy
for which Dr. King died.

We mourn the death of a
great American who had the
courage to stand for what he
believed. We will always re-
member with great warmth the
ideal which he brought forth

An adviser suggested that the

first of the convention instead of on
Saturday morning as is done now.
While saying she understood the rea-
soning behind having it at that time
(surprise, holding the delegates for
the whole program), she added “You
hear a general criticism in one of
the courses, and you dont know
whether he’s talking to you or not.”

Praise was far more frequent than
criticism. Most delegates expressed
approval of the mixer Thursday and
the dance Friday, and the friendli-
ness of everyone involved was noted.
Delegates didn’t miss Washington and
Lee students who are on spring vaca-
tion, and advisers who have attended
SiPA conventions when students were
on campus strongly favored having
it during W&L’s spring break.

One criticism was confined to the
advisers. Most thought the band
Friday night was a little noisier than
necessary. One, as far away from the
band as cozy Doremus Gymnasium
would permit, shouted, “Do they have
to play so loud?”

portant for the long-run history of
the world, McDowell said, but at the
moment, the racial issue is far more
emotional. He predicted that Hubert
Humphrey is perhaps the man who
may be able to put the country back
together again, saying that he is not
the “raving liberal” he has been
made out to be.

Concerning the candidacy of Rich-
ard Nixon, the columnist said he can
be admired very much for his ex-
perience and ability, but because of
Over-exposure since 1951, there just
isn't very much enthusiasm for him.
Furthermore, McDowell contended
that the Republican Party is a third

party in this country, behind the
Democrats and the uncommitted in-
dependents,

McDowell also touched on various
phases of high school and profession-
al journalism. “To go into the news-
paper business and stay there, you
have to like it a lot,” he said. He
emphasized the importance of going
to a college that teaches more than
practical journalism, saying that one
needs a proper background in history
and political science with which to
work,

In learning to write, McDowell
noted, one must have faith in himself
and his reader. One should let his
own natural style develop, and one
should not “write down” to his read-
er and his intelligence as though he
were a twelve-year-old.

W@L Glee Club Presents
Program With RMWC
At Lee Chapel Tonight

The Washington and Lee and the
Randolph-Macon Women’s glee clubs
will be in concert together at 8 p.m.
tonight in Lee Chapel. It will be
WA&L’s fourth concert in two days
and their second with Randolph-
Macon.

Thursday morning the club was at
Roanoke College in Salem, Va., in
a joint program with Roanoke’s choir.
That afternoon Washington and Lee
taped a television special at WDBJ
in Roanoke. The special, which will

be shown al a later date, was pro-
duced entirely by students from
WAL’s School of Journalism and
Communications. The day was

brought to a close with an evening
concert with Randolph-Macon in the

Hotel Roanoke.
Included in tonight’s repertoire is
Gustov Horst’s “Dirge from Two

Veterans”, which the club is dedicat-
ing to the men in Vietnam. Selections
from Bach, Braham, Vaughn, and
Thompson have been chosen to aug
ment the evening's entertainment.

A medley of show music will serve
to contrast the program; including
“Falling in Love,” “Try to Remem-
ber,” and “Grand Night for Singing.”
The club's tribute to Good Friday
will take the form of Mazart's “La-

height of Greek Week activities Thurs-
day night remarked, “I believe that
the fraternity system at Washington
and Lee is here indefinitely.”

Speaking before fraternity mem-
bers, Huntley used the occasion to
outline the possible future of the Uni-
versity, especially with respect to fra-
ternities.

Some of the possibilities discussed
included the building of new dorms
and other ways of “providing an
alternative to fraternity life,” require-
ments that students live in either
dormitories or fraternity houses and
future University loans to fraterni-
ties.

Huntley listed some forces at work
which “may weaken fraternities,” in-
cluding deferred rush, “the abandon-
ment of fraternities by fraternity
men,” and “University efforts to pro-

vide alternatives” to non-fraternity
men,

One of the big questions on the
campus today, Huntley said, is}

“Should we have as an objective the}

making of a residential college?” He
remarked, “It would be my hope that

we could make all choices available |
including dorms, frat-|

to students,”
ernity houses, and apartments. How-
ever, he added, “I am not sure if it
would be economically possible to
create all these alternatives.”

midsemester grades were not

posed upon the student. In addition,
some professors felt that the material
covered in the first eight weeks did
not lend itself to testing.

Reasons against the motion includ-
ed the feeling that it was important
for students and parents to have some
idea of the work done up to that
time. Others thought there might be
some way of evaluating students’ work
by means other than quizzes.

The midsemester grades were re-
tained for freshmen mainly for ad-
vising purposes.

The proposal for abolishing mid-
semester grades was first brought up
at the February faculty meeting and
referred to the Committee on Courses
and Degrees. The committee sent the
proposal to all department chairmen,
who polled their staff. These results
were taken back to the committee
and were found to be overwhelmingly
in favor of the proposal.

In other business the faculty voted
to expand the theater courses in the
Department of Fine Arts. The three
one-semester courses currently offered
will be increased to two-semester
courses. This action will be im-

and was taken on the recommenda-
tion of the Commitiee on Courses

Seven Years

The nationwide dismay at the assassination of Dr. Martin
Luther King was reflected in a special memorial service held
here Tuesday. It wasn’t a very ornate affair, nor was it even
particularly well-attended—the decision to hold it was only
made on Monday, and there was little time for publicity—
but the fact that such a service could be held here at all, only
a century after Appomatox, on the very anniversary of the
day Lee surrendered, and over Lee’s own tomb, is a remarkable
and significant event. Nor do we think that Lee himself would
have objected.

But the event was not only significant from the view-
point of W&L’s remote past. It was even more significant
and symbolic because only seven years ago, in October of
1961, the Board of Trustees of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity firmly and fiatly refused to allow Martin Luther King
to speak on this campus.

The idea had been brought up by the student executive
committee of the University Christian Association, which was
attempting to schedule a seminar on “Christian Ethics and
Non-Violent Protest in Race Relations.” Dr. King was to lead
the seminar.

The Faculty Committee on Christian Work, under whose
authority the UCA fell, recommended to the trustees and to
President Cole that the UCA be permitted to invite Dr. King.

The Board of Trustees refused to grant permission, and
declined to give a reason, although they obviously felt that it
would not be in the interests of Washington and Lee to have
Dr. King on campus.

Ironically, in the previous week faculty action had banned
the Hot Nuts from campus, so that in one week the University
was placed in the awkward position of classing Dr. Martin
Luther King with purveyors of obscene music.

That such a thing could be thought to be in the University’s
interests, and that this could happen only seven years ago, is
frankly astonishing to most students today. And it is a measure
of W&L’s good intentions that a great deal has been done
since then to change those attitudes. The King affair in 1961
raised such a furor not only here but throughout the state
that in the following year the trustees declared that a faculty
committee would have complete jurisdiction in the future over
deciding who could speak on campus. As a result, when the
UCA petitioned to have King again last year, the committee
granted the request (he was invited, but had to cancel out).
And last Monday, when the plans were made for the memorial
service, it was not even necessary to consult the trustees.

HE *

Where do we go from here? Whatever progress we've
made—and it hasn’t been small—is infinitesimal compared to
what remains. Our integration is token and likely to remain
that way for a long time. Our interest as a student body in the
racial problem is polite but unengaged, seldom real and often
purely academic. We talk about it here all the time but we
only repeat ourselves. The very things said in this editorial are
at best gropings in the dark; we are so removed from the
realities of the racial situation that we hardly even know how
to approach them. As a University, we remain loftily unaware
of social and economic conditions among the poor at our own
feet in Lexington and Rockbridge County. Our attitudes are
sympathetic, our actions few and, frankly, half-hearted. For
this, both the University and the student body bear equal
blame. It remains to be seen whether they will assume an
equal responsibility for the future.

Chastisement Dept.

We take this opportunity to recommend the remarks be
low to every W&L student for careful perusal and concerned
thought. Ir seems that the VMI student newspaper, the
“Cadet,” was editorializing about the new policy of unlimited
cuts for second semester First Classmen (who more or less
resemble our seniors), and it occurred to the editors to cast a
baleful glance down the road in our direction ee.

“One warning, we feel, should be issued at this time.
Some years ago, W&L, which we in the barracks often tend

(Right away we began to wonder about the accuracy of
their information about Wael . Besides, they probably Say that
about all civilian schools.)

"which we in the barracks often tend to equate with
the ideal civilian institution, established a system of unlimited
class cuts for some of its students. For the first few months
instructors were faced with an incredible dearth of students,
Heads were shaken furiously, grades came out, and sud-
denly there was a profusion of learning-hungry students
beating a path to academic buildings. The implications are
clear. Too much of a good thing ceases to be a good thing
anymore,”

"It seems fairly certain that most of the men now enjoy-
ing this benefit will be wise enough to take advantage of it
properly. If nothing else, this may be an opportunity for
VMI to prove that cadets are more academically inclined
than the rival ‘Minks’. Let’s not have the sudden lack of
academic interest happen here.”

Indeed not.

Sir:

It is my opinion that the caption
under the picture of the peace demon-
strators (page 4, Tues. 26 Mar.) was
in extremely poor taste. Furthermore,
it was in error. The demonstrators
were eighty-five strong, not thirty as
you so unbiasedly reported. The
whole overtone of the statement was
an affront on the integrity of a group
of sincere young men. The Tuesday

quite fair in the past, | hope it has

GREEK WEEK RELAY RACE:

 

Muhammed

Ali Speaks:

‘World Without Whites’

It was April Fool’s Day but it was
not put on. “He really is beautiful...
He is the greatest.” Cassius Clay's
visit to Fairleigh Dickinson Univer-
sity, Teaneck (N. J.) campus, brought
back to mind the days earlier in this
decade when this Black American was
truely a contemporary folk hero,

Since victory in the 1960 Olympics,
Clay—or Muhammed Ali as he would
be called—has been in the public
eye. This grandson of a former slave
became many things to many people
as he talked and boxed his way to
a heavyweight title fight with the
seemingly unbeatable Sonny Liston.
Most feared he would be anihilated.
To some his boasting and irreverence
on the scene of American athletics
where even white perofrmers choose
to remain soft-spoken demanded that
he meet defeat against Liston in
Miami Beach.

But most of all, Ali represented an
American success story. The kids on
every playground in the country,
segreagated or not, looked upon him
as a hero, From lily-white suburbs
to the most unhappy black ghettos,
people reacted to him. Beneath all
talk however was the realization that
this was a good boxer, later to be

proven great. And beneath it all,
he was recognized as part of the
American Dream. From slums to a

pinnacle for those who were to rise
no less than a tanned Frank Mer-
riwell. If America was truly a melt-
ing pot, on his rise to the heavy-
weight boxing championship of the
world, Muhammed Ali became a
target image for those who were to
rise from the mixing pot. Boxing had
always been the first of the stepping
stones to success for the waves of

American immigrants, the Italians,
the Irish, the Jews. And now it was
accepting another wave. Only this
One was from the depths and the

dregs of American society where the
Negro in the United States had been
placed. The boy from Louisville took
advantage of his opportunity,

So there was a lot behind the ova
tions that greeted the Champ as he
rose to speak at FDU on that windy
first day in April. But the chill was
left outside as the Boxer began. He
explained his present position as a
Black Muslim minister in the service
of Allah and the prophet Elijah Mu-
hammed. From there he called for
questions. The people were his fans
and he wanted to tell them all that
jhe could,

The reception may not have been
as favorable if the audience was not
college age students, and the more
liberal at that. These students
were liberals and their flag was waved

ones

at all times. They too were against
the draft. Ali’s radical views were
not enough to make him unaccept-

able or any less the hero. They too
had a gripe with the administration.
Ali

was never one to dodge an
answer. Years of Black Muslin in-
struction came to the front. It was

a symphonic response. The power and
force of the years of Negro life pro-
vided the background rhythm. To
that was added the craftmanship of
the Muslim woodwinds playing with
a man’s beliefs, whistling in the air
for all to hear. And every Negro
was represented in the champs answer
as the brass played out a wild R&B
sound. Ali talked with pride of his
Black heritage, every black had to

Nolan’s Sacrifice Fly In Fifth
Brings In Third Diamond Win

By THUNDER THORNTON

The Generals equaled last year’s
baseball win mark Wednesday by
nudging Oneonta State 3-2 in Lex-
ington. The victory put the winner's
won-lost record at three wins and
three losses. No Washington and Lee
baseball team has won more than
three in the last two years, so a
victory in today’s game at Lynchburg
(no score was available before the
paper went to press) would be a
milestone of sorts.

Washington and Lee scores came
in the second and fifth innings while
Oneonta pushed both — their
runs in the third.

Leading off for the Generals in the
second, Jim Wilson stroked a triple
and was in prime scoring position.
After Charlie Freret walked and Scott
McCrystal struck out, Jack Baizley
slashed a run scoring single. The next
run was plated when Steve Kalista
hit into a weird double play, with
Freret scoring before the final out
of the inning.

Nolan Scores

After Oneonta promptly tied the
score with their runs in the third, the
victors put the deciding score on the
board in the fifth. Sophomore catcher
Baizley led off by reaching base on
an error, then moved to second on
a base on balls to Kalista. Freshman
outfielder Ray Coates sacrificed both
runners around, and John Nolan
poled a sacrifice fly that sent Baizley
scurrying across the plate with the
ball game.

Although all the scoring was done

across

Baizely

for the day, it remained for this
year’s surprise fireman, Tom Mitchell,
to finish up and collect the win.
Mitchell, an all-conference outfielder,
came in to relieve starter Bill Ras-
mussen in the third and worked six
and two-thirds innings without giv-
ing up a run.

To date, Mitchell has worked
thirteen and one-third innings with-

Wednesday's big hitters were Nolan
(2 for 3 and an RBI), Wilson (2 for

the spring and helped boost his slug-

In response to questions about some
expenditures on books for the Mock
Convention, Steve Saunders, chairman
of the Mock Convention, stated that
the books were needed for the pre-
paration of the platform and the
research behind it. The Mock Con-
vention has so far spent about $140
for the books that will become the
property of the interim coordinating
committee,

Saunders urged that the EC con-
sider making provision for space for
convention files in the new Student
Union because the future of the
Dutch Inn was in doubt.

Enforcement of conventional dress

ferred for a week.

(Continued from Page 2)

identify with what he said, His senti-
ments made sense,

“For years we have been beat
when we tried to integrate. Now we
have to go our own way. Being white
isn’t so great.” For three hundred
years the blackman has been giving
to America. To Ali, it was the sweat
of his black ancestors that oiled the
machinery of America—and he is
not far from wrong. “Now we take,
we've given long enough. We're going
to make a wrold without whites, Don’t
give us jobs, we don’t want hand
outs. Give us land, the land that we
have worked for three hundred years.
We will take care of ourselves.

And that was it. He didn’t want the
whites who came to cheer him. He
didn’t care about the ones who came
to boo, The students tried to be
accepted by him. Girls best described
as tough said—we like you no matter
what your color is. And Ali liked
that, he is still a ladies man. But he
only knew hate and bitterness when-
ever he tried to mix with whites.
There is no man who ever learns to
accept that sort of treatment, the
treatment that Negroes in America
get everyday.

Greek Week Contest Winner

Sazeracs

To Appear
On TV Show

For the member of the Sazeracs,
W&L’s informal singing group,
Spring Holidays meant an unexpected
TV debut on the daytime program
“Treasure Island,”

This year the group had been per-
forming at the Taboo Club in Riviera
Beach, Florida, during vacation. Hav-
ing some free time, some of the mem-
bers inadvertently came across a film-
ing session for “Treasure Island.”
When the session was completed, a
lady connected with the program ap-
proached some of the members and
asked them where they were from. A
few of the members, including John
Ballantine, Bill McKelway and Bob
Miller, did not pass up the opportunity
to mention that they were a singing
group.

The lady then asked them if they
would come to the next taping of the
show at The Colonnades, a hotel
there. So on last Thursday, April 4,
the Sazeracs made their debut on
the program which will be ‘broadcast
over Channel 13 (ABC) in Lexing-
ton next Thursday.

The Sazeracs intend to have try-
outs for all parts on the Tuesday and
Wednesday following Springs Week-
end (April 23 and 24).

Hinkle Leads Generals
Over EM Thinclads

(Continued from page 3)

The pole vault has been expected
to be a pjroblem spot earlier in the
year, but bolstered by the return of
two vaulters from last year’s team,
things have proved otherwise. W&L
took first, second and third in the
event and it was one of the few
events in which the Generals placed
against Richmond.

While the Blue may have been
dominating the field events and short
distances, the same could hardly be
said for the long distances. Eastern
Mennonite placed first and second in
the 880, the mile, and the two-mile

Concerning college regulation of
fraternity life, Fletcher remarked,
“The pendulum swings between di-

Other Activities

Other Greek Week activities in-

Thursday afternoon, participation in
the Lexington Clean-up Campaign
this afternoon, and a beer rally and
trophy presentation at 4:30 today.

Sigma Phi Epsilon came in first in

Under the program, Mary Baldwin
physics majors will take several ad-
vanced physics courses here during
their sophomore, junior and senior
years. The program wil not be fully
implemented until the 1969-1970
school year, and only a limited num-
ber of Mary Baldiwn students are
expected to participate.

Efforts will be made to arrange
schedules so that the girls can travel
the 34 miles between Staunton and
Lexington with a minimum of in-
convenience.

WAL officials stressed that the pro-
gram is not a move by the Uni-
versity toward coeducational status.

The expanded theater arts courses
will be as follows: Fine Arts 122,
now Fundamentals of Theater Art
will become a two-semester course
(Fine Arts 121 and 122) in Stage
Craft; Fine Arts 124, Advanced Act-
ing and Dramatic Interpretation, will
be added to follow the present acting
and dramatic interpretation course
(Fine Arts 123); and Fine Arts 222,
currently called Directing the Play,
will be moved up to the first semester
with a new advanced directing course
to follow it in the second semester.

With the expansion of three se-
mester courses, a total of 24 hours
of Theater courses can be offered.
This concentration will be within a
Fine Arts Major with the remaining
12 hours coming from an allied field.

Invitation To View Eclipse

A total lunar eclipse will occur
occur tonight between 9:11 p.m. and
2:24 a.m., according to Dr. Howard
F. Turner of the Physics Department.

On an information sheet distribut-
ed this week Dr. Turner explained
further that little of interest to the
ordinary observer will actually occur
until the umbral phase begins, ex-
tending from 10:10 p.m. to 1:25 a.m.
Totality will last from 11:22 p.m.
to 12:12 a.m.

Dr. Turner has invited all the mem-
bers of the W&L academic com-
munity to view the eclipse from the
12-inch reflecting telescope in the
WA&L observatory on Howe Hall. A
number of small telescopes will also
be made available, and observers are
requested to bring binoculars if pos-
sible.

Crenshaw, Passavant,
Petitions For Student

Eleven candidates for student body
offices emerged when the deadline for
the filing of petitions was reached
yesterday. The election for the “Big
Four” is planned for next Monday,
but primaries will be required for
two of the offices—the president of
the student body and Fancy Dress.

For Student Body President Herb
Crenshaw, SPE from Forest City,
N.C.; Jay Passavant, PiKA from
Beaver, Penn.; and Jeff Wexler from
Cedarhurst, N. Y., have been nomi-
nated. The primary is planned for
this Thursday. Students will vote for
these candidates and the two highest
vote-getters will face each other on
Monday.

Jeb Brown, Phi Gam from Po-
tomac, Md., is running against Danny
Leonard, a Phi Kap from Roswell,
N.M., for vice-president.

Student-body secretary is also a
two-man race with Mark Faverman,
ZBT from Norfolk, running against
Judson Simmons, a KA from Atlanta.

The post of Fancy Dress President
is being sought by four students who
are rising seniors, Carlisle Landreth,

IFC Greek Week

The Pi Phi's won for the second
straight year the Greek Week contest
sponsored by the IFC. Lambda Chi
finished second, four points behind
the Pi Phi’s. Third went to Sigma Nu
and fourth to Sigma Chi,

The first lecture was attended by
193 students while 171 appeared at
the second. Twelve houses participat-
ed in the relay, and two others started
but did not finish. In the community
clean-up, only five houses participated
with a total of 117 students partici-
pating.

Last year the Pi Phi's finished first,
while the Phi Ep’s were second and
the Beta’s were third. This year the
Phi Ep’s fell to seventh place while
the Beta’s held on to fifth place.

The relay event was won by SPE
with a smashing score of 18:23, edg-
ing out Sigma Nu by three seconds.
Third in the relay went to the Phi
Gam's.

 

Sharpe, a Phi Delt from Burlington,
N.C.; Dave Stovall, a PiKA from
Harrisonburg; and Alan Tomlin, a
Kappa Sig from Fort Worth, are the
candidates. These will also face a
primary on Thursday to determine
which two will enter the finals on
Monday.

Class elections are planned for later
on in the month for all of the class
officers and the EC positions. Dates
for applications for these positions

will be set after the “Big Four” race
is decided.
Speeches Tonight
Speeches are scheduled for the

candidates in Evans Dining Hall to-
night at 7 p.m. The candidates will
discuss the issues and answer ques-
tions from the students. The assembly
is open to all members of the student

President Huntley Visits EC

Last night President Robert E. R.
Huntley visited the Executive Com-
mittee to answer questions from mem-
bers of the EC and to discuss ways

President Huntley also listed some
of the pressing needs of the Uni-
versity. He stated that the physical
needs were the most obvious, with
such often-discussed projects as a new
field house, renovation of Newcomb
Hall and the law school, construction
of a theatre and library expansion

Sam Hinkle, Delt from Shelbyville,

cations for positions on the Contact

the issue to get mad at the University
would probably find some other ex-
cuse if changing dress standards were
not used.

In other actions, the Executive

by Dr. Jay Cook to study proposals

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, April 16, 1968

 

A landmark, and how it was got

No more mid-semester grades (after the freshman year). It
almost goes without saying that it is a step of the first magnitude
towards regaining the proper emphasis of the faculty’s and
students’ respective (theoretical) goals: imparting and acquir-
ing educations. Especially in the minds of those of us who
last week had to explain away as many as three administrative
mid-term grades. We thank the faculty.

What is somehow disturbing to us, all the same, is that
it was the Hill that had to come up with the idea. Although
pure selflessness doesn’t fully explain the tenured teachers’
action, it does seem vaguely ironic that a student government
which once upon a time showed a little bit of interest in mid-
term grade reform had to be done one better by the faculty.

Me
Restoring lost confidence

 

Now comes the Tuesday Edition to comment upon the issuc |
of arbitrary grades. Because of the vacation, this is our first
opportunity to add our loud voice to that of the Friday Edition
in its request that some sort of grade-review mechanism be
established as quickly as possible.

The “crisis of confidence’? which in general precipitated
the present public discussion is, or was—so far as we can tell
very real and unexaggerated. Discontent exists, subtly, in a
number of places. And wherever it resides, it does this Uni-
versity no good when students have to explain a correctable-
but-uncorrected injustice; it does a decided disservice when stu-
dents, applying for graduate school or perhaps for jobs, don’t
have the opportunity to explain it—when it’s just there on
the transcript.

 

It’s easy to say, “do something.” It’s considerably more
difficult to specify, “do this.” (One thing it’s not at all difficult
to overrule is the weird suggestion to do away with the tensure
system.) At any rate, the faculty and administration are far,
far better equipped than we to determine the specific “this”
that ought to be done. One faculty member has even sug-
gested that whatever “this” is, it might be considered only a
sort of stopgap measure until grades are either done away with
altogether (not an unprecedented system among better col-
leges) or until grades-reports are fundamentally changed so
that they reflect what a student has accomplished rather than
emphasize what he has (in one teacher's view) failed to ac-
accomplish.

Whatever the solution is—and it would be better than
what we have: nothing—we can’t emphasize too strongly the
essentiality of discovering and implementing it without a day’s
needless delay. Normally it would be superficial to reiterate the
necessity of students’ having confidence in the professors who
grade them. A professor whose students are convinced he
makes a practice of giving blatantly unfair, arbitrary grades,
grades that simply do not resemble or reflect the level of stu-
dents’ accomplishments, is—at best—of utterly no use to the
purposes of Washington and Lee.

Committee Behind The Scenes
Considers Action For Changes

By LARRY HONIG

Washington and Lee's faculty is
the body directly responsible for
changes in the curriculum, such as
the recent addition of the pass/fail
option. But behind the scenes of most
such action is the prestigious—and
hard-working—Commitice on Cours-
es and Degrees.

Dean of the College and ex officio
Committee Chairman W. W. Pusey
submitted pass/fail to his colleagues
on the Committee last March at a
regular weekly meeting. Since that
time, the Committee has recommend-
ed, successfully, to the faculty the
change in examination schedules, the
abolishment of mid-term grade re-
ports above the fershman year, and
the expansion of courses in the
theatre.

But That's Not All...

These perhaps are the most dra-
matic of the Committee's duties. But
there are other equally important
questions put before Dean Pusey, ex
officio member and Dean of the Com-
School L. W. Adams, and

of the Committee's concern with
changes in major requirements.

day school week.

matters as a students’s wanting to

As far as special requests are con-
cerned, the job of excepting students
from certain rules or interpreting those
rules falls to the Committee. Perhaps
the most frequent of such requests
come from seniors who wish to re-
duce their course load to 12 hours.
These are not often granted, but Dean
Pusey is quick to point out “we try,

Huntley Reviews
Plans For Gym
And Dormitories

Speaking of specifics in the Uni-
versity’s physical development pro-
gram, President Robert E. R. Huntley
tells students that a lot of plans are
a lot closer to completion than nearly
everybody had supposed.

In an address to a lecture audience
Thursday during Greek Week, and
subsequently in comments yesterday
to the Executive Committee and in
an interview with the Ring-tum Phi,
President Huntley said specific pro-
posals for a new field house, for
renovation of or an addition to Mc-
Cormick Library, for the same to
Newcomb and Tucker Halls, and for
improvements and additions to a host
of other facilities have all been sub-
mitted, are being discussed, and are
approaching the preliminary decision
stage.

Doremus Inadequate

About a new gym: “Nobody thinks
Doremus is adequate,” he said. Archi-
tect’s drawings (by Clark, Nexsen
and Owen of Lynchburg, who plan-
ned the new Student Union under
construction now) were made some
time ago; being discussed now is
whether these are sufficient for W&L’s
needs, wants and finances.

Meetings have been taking place
regularly and frequently among the
President, the University Development
Office (directed by Messrs. Frank Par-
sons and Farris Hotchkiss), and the
coaches to determine just what func-
tional needs ought to be met by the
new gym: how much indoor athletic
area do we need, and how should it
be allocated. It's not a question of
whether to build or not, Mr. Huntley
says, but rather exactly what it is
that needs to be built to best serve
the University. And the day of de-
cision is not at all in the far-off
future, when a specific proposal will
be made to the Trustees, when fund-
raising can begin and, ultimately, con-
struction will start.

Not So Simple

Even with a gym, though, it's not
as simple as how many handball
courts do we need. We don't need as
much indoor space as, say, Dartmouth,
but don’t we need more than, say,
Tampa? How do we go about re-
constructing the fields (this does have
to be done)? Artificial turf? There's
serious talk of it. The ideas are all
there. And they're being sifted. The
answers are in sight.

The same process, Mr. Huntley told
the Ring-tum Phi, is concurrently be-
ing followed regarding the library (a
new wing is being contemplated;
space-allocation insufficiencies are ob-
vious and are being considered; but
the problem is complicated by the
comparatively inflexible construction
of McCormick as it is now);

It’s being followed about the Com-
merce School (can Newcomb be add-
ed on to without making the front
campus intolerably ugly? can it be
restructured from the inside’);

It's being followed about a little
theatre, which “hopefully can be given
about the same priority as a gym”
(could Doremus be converted into
something along this line when it's
the phys ed people? is

Ruggers Will Host Tournament

By STEVE MASON

Last year a new organization came
into being at Washington and Lee—
the Rugby Club. People read articles
about it and commented that it was
nice but no one seemed interested
enough to come to a match or help
a group of dedicated “ruggers” gain
the backing that was necessary to field
a team.

The players themselves have knock-
ed on doors of the local towns people
simply because the W&L community
won't support them. Recently the IFC
took a step in the right direction by
sponsoring the upcoming Invitational
Rugby Tournament to take place here
this coming weekend.

Rugby is an interesting game to
watch, with the speed of basketball
and the contact of football; its a
shame that it can’t receive the back-
ing of either the P.E. department
or the E.C, One of the present E.C.
members had the following plank in
his platform: “The newly formed
rugby team has obviously proved suc-
cessful and has well represented W&L
at many different schools. Certain
small conditions will have to be met,
but the rugby team can add a great
deal of spirit to W&L.” For some
reason or anther the E.C. has not
given its support to the Rugby Club,

The Rugby Club has a schedule
that would make any coach in the
gym green with envy. Included are
such teams as U.N.C., Duke (who is
also participating in the tournament),
U.Va., N.C. State, Princeton, and
other nationally known _ schools.
Needless to say, exposure such as
this is one of the most beneficial
means of enhancing our reputation
and getting our name into the sports
pages of national newspapers, How
often does the football team receive
mention in the Washington Post with
such opponents as Bridgewater? Foot-
ball at W&L has been an economically
unsound venture since it was de-em-
phasized.

Rugby, on the other hand, has none
of the great expense of football, yet
does more to help W&L. Some of
the difficulties the Rugby Club has
had are some what out keeping with
the service they are doing to the
University community. For example,
when they are lucky they are allowed
to play on the I.M. field.

Aside from being too small, the
ground is so hard that hardly a game

 

 

attributable to it. Wilson Field is
the only suitable area but the Club
is denied its use.

At U.Va. Rugby has reached a
point where it overshadows football.
reams from all over the eastern sea-
board gather there to play. U.Va.
has achieved a status that we too
could achieve if only we had the re-
sources. With a budget of $2,000 we
could operate on an equal basis with
U.Va. This proposal warrants serious
consideration from everyone, from the
E.C, to the Board of Trustees.

The tournament this weekend will
include three other teams besides our
own club, Duke, Lynchburg, and a
third team as yet unnamed. Four
trophies have been purchased at a
cost of $120 and will be awarded to
the victors. They are “Dublin Cups,”
a sort of eight-sided bowl which is
quite in keeping with the European

arte tie ee

will be on Saturday, about an hour
before the lacrosse game; the second
match will follow the lacrosse. On
Sunday at 2 p.m. the finals will take
place. A rugby match is shorter than

‘Hurricane’ Warnings Released

After Springs Cocktail Party

A “Hurricane” watch has been
issued in Lexington for this weekend.
But there's nothing to be worried
about. This should be the greatest
“Hurricane to hit Washington
and

Lee.
The watch was announced this
afternoon by junior class president
John Carrere while he was watching
proceedings at the University Cocktail
Party at Red Square. While Bob
Marshall and the Crystals sang “She
Shot a Hole in My Soul,” Carrere
commented, “I hope the ‘Hurricanes’
don't do much damage.” Of
course, he was referring to the rum
drink served at the cocktail party
imported from Pat O'Brien's in New
Orleans.

lo make the “Hurricane” watch
more enjoyable, Carrere and his vice-
presidents (Rob Bauer, Buck Buxton,
Bill Ball, Bruce Downing, Neil Kes

General Elections On Monday;
Presidential Primary Is Close

By BOB ENTZMINGER

Herb Crenshaw and Jay Passavant
led the voting for student body presi-
dent and Don Sharpe and Alan Tomlin
made the cut-off for Fancy Dress
president in Thursday's primaries.
The general elections for student body
offices will be all day Monday. Polls
will be located in the freshman quad,
Washington Hall, the Commons and

the law school.
Candidates Speak
Candidates for the Big Three

offices—student body president, vice-
president, and secretary—spoke to
about 80 students in Evans Dining
Hall Tuesday night. Candidates for
Fancy Dress president were intro-
duced, but gave no speeches.

Presidential candidates Jeff Wexler
of Cedarhurst, N. Y., Jay Passavant,
PiKA from Beaver, Pa., and Herb
Crenshaw, SPE from Forest City,
N. C., all proposed platforms which
they said would create more student
interest and participation and to im-
prove the University, both physically
and as an academic community. (See
platforms on p. 2)

Allen Craig nominated Jeff Wexler.
Wexler presented a platform asking |
for a co-op run on a non-profit basis, |
library improvements, Executive Com- |
mittee jurisdiction over the Dance |
Board, Fancy Dress scheduling by'

 

referendum, student management of
WLUR-FM, reviewable grades and
more vending machines in the dorms,

John Carrere introduced Jay Pas-
savant. Passavant said that his many
school activities gave him the neces-
sary diversity and technical com-
petence to be president. He asked
for a general review of standards and
goals, especially in the Assimilation
Committee, and he favored not join-
ing the Virginia Association of Stu-
dent Governments (VASG) now, but
stressed that the matter is “not closed.”
He also affirmed recent administra-
tion recommendations concerning re-
pair of fraternity and the Gaines So-
ciety houses, and agreed with Presi-
dent Huntley's effort to establish
closer communication between stu-
dent groups and the president.

Clark Carter introduced Herb
Crenshaw. Crenshaw said that while
he was willing to stand on his record,
he believed that the students should
play a larger and more active role in
the University’s future. The planks of
his platform included a renewal of
open student support for the Honor
System as it stands, no Saturday
classes, exams before Christmas, join-
ing the VASG, more student-faculty
interchange both on committees and
informally, and a review of the role
of student committees.

Candidates for vice-president are
Jeb Brown, Phi Gam from Potomac,

 

gins at 8 p.m. with Anthony and the
Imperials and the Isley Brothers.
Conventional dress will be required
at both concerts.

 

Will Discuss Admiralty Law

The University Proctor suggests
that during Springs Weekend lug-
gage should not be left in cars
unless locked in the trunk, and
dormitory room doors should be
locked in the occupants’ absence.

 

Extensive decorations are also plan-
ned for the concerts and the students
have been asked not to tear them
up or take them as souvenirs since
many of them are rented. There will
be of candle lanterns on the
grass outside the gym. The columns
will be decorated with eleven pen
nanis in a butterfly arrangement
Over the door will be a sign reading
“French Quarter Vieux Carre.”

Friedman Claims Controls Hurt Public

By PAT AREY

Competition is the best way to
control the economy, Dr. Milton
Friedman told Washington and Lee
students Thursday.

Friedman, a critic of the “new
economics” and advisor to 1964 presi-
dential candidate Barry Goldwater,
spoke in Lee Chapel at the annual
Phi Beta Kappa-Cincinnatti Society
day convocation.

Ihe best control for a capitalist,
Dr. Friedman said, “is another capit-
alist on his tail.”

He said he opposed such programs
as import quotas, farm subsiding and
urban renewal, because these pro-
grams favor business interests instead

of consumers.
Urban renewal, he said, has elimi-
nated some slums, but not slum

dwellers, And it has resulted in fewer
housing units.

Throughout the economic structure
are an enormous amount of pro-
grams serving special intrests, Dr.
Friedman said. These special interests
represent the producer, rather than
the consumer, he added

The auto safety law recently pass-
ed by Congress is being taken over
by special interests, he pointed out
The law has already made it more
difficult for foreign-made to
compete in American markets,

Dr. Friedman also noted that his
proposed “negative income tax” would

proposal would allow people on wel
fare to retain a portion of their

earnings, if they could get a job,
instead of forfeiting that same amount
in welfare benefits.

This program, Dr. Friedman said,
would provide an incentive for people
on welfare to get a job.

from Roswell, N. Mex.

Brown said that he felt past EC’s
had not been as progressive and as
efficient as they might have been.
He stressed the need for an active
student body to meet the challenge
of improving W&I.

Leonard sai that in his two EC
terms he had seen many proposals
fail narrowly when the proper leader-
ship could have made them successful.
He stressed that the school’s transi-
tion years had passed and that next
year is crucial in W&L’s future. He
asked for a review of student com-
mittees and encouragement of build-
ing programs. Of the Honor System
he said that its spirit must be revived.
The student body as a whole, he
said, had lost its “spirit of concern,”
and the EC must “instill a sense of
responsibility” that is now missing.

Greek Week Farce

Shall we stop kidding ouselves? Greek
Week is a farce. If by some happy stroke it
were abolished tomorrow, we’d be hard press-
ed to find anyone on this campus who could
shed an honest tear over it—and frankly, we
can’t find that attitude very blamable.

No one should try to find fault with the
IFC committee which was placed in charge
of organizing the Greek Week program. Faced
with the Greek Week concept, the committee
did everything it could have done to make it
work, and it deserves praise for that. If its
efforts did not have the success it deserved,
the blame lies with the Greek Week idea,
and not with those who had the work within
its limitations.

The truth is that there is probably no stu-
dent institution at W&L which is so little in
keeping with the temper of the students at
whom it is directed, or less arouses their in-
terest. Those who wish to do so may drag up
the old cry of “Apathy!”, but in this case, at
least, apathy is no crime.

Greek Week is the child of last year’s intense
debate over the goals and purposes of the
fraternity system here. Under pressure from
both faculty and students, the IFC began a
half-hearted study of means to redirect those
goals, partly out of a sincere interest in re-
form, partly in order to get the heat turned
off. One of the programs that floated to the
surface was Greek Week. Fifteen houses de-
cided to vote for it, two abstained, and only
one voted resolutely against it. There can
be little doubt that most of those who voted
for the program did so from mixed and not
always lofty motives. The house that voted
against it probably expressed the real opinion
of many, but did so for all the wrong reasons
(ie., that fraternities, being purely social
clubs, have no reason to justify themselves
in other activities) .

That’s how Greek Week got started—an
experiment for some, a dodge for many, a
sincere reform for a very few. As an experi-
ment it has definitely outlived its usefulness;
as a reform it has been a flat failure. If it
has succeeded as a dodge, that is only to the
fraternities’ discredit.

To put it simply, Greek Week has nothing
to say to W&L fraternity men. Of the three
main parts of the program—community serv-
ice, lectures on the role of fraternities at
W&L, and the relay games—only the latter
arouses any real interest, and that is the part
of Greek Week that lies farthest from the
program’s real aims. If there was any attend-
ance at last week’s two lectures, it was because
there was a trophy waiting for whoever could
rack up the most points, not because anyone
there thought that what was said was going

to be of any importance. And the community
service activities were undertaken for the same
reasons.

Greek Week is an empty form, complied
with by most fraternities and ignored, prob-
ably more honestly, by a few. The conditions
which give substance to the form at other
colleges do not exist here, and it is foolish
to imagine that those conditions will be created
here by observance of the form. The whole
business stands as an example of what happens
when institutions are imported whole from
other schools without shaping them to special
problems here.

If we are to have a program of some kind
which will remind fraternities of their responsi-
bility to the university and to the community,
then it will have to be a great deal different.
To start with, it will have to have the respect
among students which Greek Week will never
have. It will have to be a continuing program,
one which takes in activities consistently and
regularly during the whole year, instead of
only during a few days of one week. Its
proper functioning will have to be made
the responsibility of a permanent body—if
not the IFC Judicial Board itself, then at
least a standing committee similar to those
which operate under the EC—which will hold
regular meetings, take advantage of special
opportunities which may arise for fraternities
to make a significant contribution to the
school or the community, and act generally
as a liaison between the fraternities and those
to whom the fraternities have a responsibility.
At least minimum observance of the program
will have to be made mandatory, and the IFC,
which is so lavish with fines over something
it really cares about, like Rush Week, can
afford to levy a few fines over what it ought
to care about. And the program must come
voluntarily from the fraternities themselves;
threats will only bring on more Greek Weeks.

But no program, however well organized,
will ever be anything more than a form as
long as the fraternity men of this campus
remain divided over just what the responsi-
bilities of a fraternity toward the university
and the community are. The gap between
those who feel a fraternity is justified as a
social club and those who feel it ought to be
more is a wide one, and there are many more
people who believe in the social concept than
they themselves will admit. Somehow, this
division of opinion must be resolved; unanim-
mous purpose is the prerequisite, not the
result, of an effective program. And all this
in turn requires that the hypocrisy that pres-
ently conceals the division be cleaned away.

As a step in the right direction, how about
ending Greek Week?

ty JUDSON SIMMONS

It has not been my practice in the
past, nor shall it be my purpose as
Secretary of the
Student Body
simply to criticize,
but rather to sug-
gest: instead of just

questions, | shall
attempt answers.
rather than tear

down, | shall build
up

In this election
my primary con-
cern is the apathy
in Washington and

Simmons

Lee student government. | believe that

 

 

Probably the biggest problem at
WAL is that there is a general lack
of true “student voice.” I feel that
the student body should give a great
deal of choice to current and relative
student issues and problems.

A major problem consists of a gen-
eral lack of communication between
the members of the student body.
and the Executive Committee. 1
would try to alleviate, in part, this
problem by editing a newsletter which
would contain the minutes of the
previous E.C, meeting, and an ex-
planation of what is occurring in
committees as well, This newsletter
could include letters from members

 

of the student body as well. This

this apathy is partially due to lack of
communication between the EC, the
students, the faculty, and the Ad-
ministration. | propose that this gap
in communication could in part be
remedied by the Secretary of the
Student Body publishing the EC
minutes in the Ring-tum Phi and by

| sending a copy of them to each of

the fraternity houses, If elected, this
I promise to do. More significantly,
I think that this apathy is due to a
lack of positive leadership. Before

| WAL students can take an active in-
| terest in their government, they must

| believe

that the EC is being con-
structive—-is initiating action. The EC
must in some way inspire the student
body. As Secretary of the Student
Body, | believe that I can help pro
vide this needed leadership

The “student voice” could also be
heard by means of a student forum.
This would be an open discussion
sponsored by the EC which would
include speakers—cither noted of

otherwise, on topics which the stu-|
dent body is interested in and feels)
pertinent. | would propose such a_

measure if | am elected. This would
allow students of all classes to voice
their opinions and take an active part
in pertinent student affairs, This
would also allow for a true exchange
ot ideas—something greatly lacking
on the WAL campus at this time,

In conjunction with this “student
forum,” | would also propose a stu-

At present, there is no central
committee in charge of appraising the
progress and directing the implementa-
tion of the recommendations of the
Self-Study. As a member of the EC
I will work towards the creation of
such a committee,

Furthermore, through the Curricu-
lum Committee the EC could exert
much influence in such matters as the
institution of a flexible exam schedule
and the lengthening of semester break.
While limited progress has been made
in this direction, | think much more
can be achieved, As Secretary of the

least initiate action:

First, we need a more flexible exam
schedule by giving students a choice
of the days on which they wish to
take final exams. Second, as was
recommended in the Self-Study Re-
port, first semester exams would be
more advantageous if held ‘before, not
after Christmas vacation, Third, Sat-
urday classes should be abolished, and
we first began this drive in 1966,
when we were able to have abolished
the Saturday classes of Openings and
Springs. Fourth, we should have more
student representation on faculty
committees.

All four of these measures are di-
rectly beneficial to students them-
selves. They are consistent with the
movement which resulted in the
abolishment of mid-semester grades.
I served as chairman of the com-
mittee which studied and recommend-
ed this.

Of course we need much more
than even this. I support affiliation
with the Virginia Association of Stu-
dent Governments, enlargement of

For Student Body President . . .

the Curriculum Committee, re-organi-
zation of the Assimilation Committee
and of freshman camp, as well as
closer general E.C. supervision over
the various committee chairmen.

I think that if we are not fooling
ourselves, experience is essential to
strong leadership. The President of
the student body is responsible for
administering the honor system, not
for just sitting in and voting in a
trial. He conducts the trial. This is
why I sincerely believe E.C. ex-
perience is essential for the Student
Body President.

The vision which I have of Wash-
ington and Lee’s Executive committee
is one in which significant improve-
ments can and will be achieved in
the areas which affect the students,
hence my emphasis on exam and
schedule reform.

Each of us builds in his own way
a part of the structure of what we
want in next year’s E.C. By your
support in Monday’s balloting, we
will have laid a cornerstone of
realistic and meaningful reform.
Then, together, we can build on that
foundation.

 

Jay Passavant

By JAY PASSAVANT

Undoubtedly, one of the foremost
questions that I have encountered dur-
ing my campaign
this week is wheth-
er or not I feel
I can handle the
job of Executive
Committee Presi-
dent without hav-
ing had previous
E. C. experience.
The answer is a
very definite yes,
for the following
reasons,

Initially 1 feel
that leadership, as such, is a prime
qualification for this office. The presi-
dent of the E.C. must be capable of
commanding the respect and co-
operation, not only of other E.C,
members, but of the entire student
body. I feel that my qualifications

 

as a leader speak for themselves, and

 

much from this experience.

Secondly, the president of the E.C.
needs a knowledge of the procedural
system not only in legislative matters
but also in Honor trials. To me, there
is no question that based on my past
dealings with procedure as president
of my fraternity, in the LF.C., and
as president of the F.C.A., I could
very easily and quickly adjust to the
procedure system as established in the
B.C.

To summarize, it is my belief that
my past record as a leader and my
familiarity with technical procedures
more than confirm my ability not only
to cope with problems of the E.C.,
but to deal with them capably,
straightforwardly, and systematically.
One of the primary reasons for my
running for the office of Student
Body President is that I feel that a
new dimension so to speak can be
added to the Executive Committee.
Through active student participation
and direct consultation and confronta-
tion with interested students | would
like to see the E.C. become a more

I can assure you that | have gained) creative, a more influential, and a

 

more useful form of expression at
Washington and Lee. I have been
convinced during the course of my
campaign that many students are
themselves concerned about the gen-
eral apathy and lack of interest which
has crept over our university, and
these same students are very eager
to find a means by which this apathy
can be assuaged. In conjunction with
this, I strongly urge that the E.C.
initiate a program by which direct
consultation with President Huntley
would be possible. The president has
expressed an interest; it is now up to
us. Callousness toward Lexington
community problems is another form
of apathy and one which I feel much
can be done, as evidenced by my pro-
posal of a Big Brother system for
WA&L and town boys,

The problems are large in number
and my space is limited but simply
let me say in closing that the time
has come to Washington and Lee
for a rebirth of initiative, expression,
and participation and | would be hon-
ored to lead you, the student body,
in initiating such a change.

 

Jeb Brown

By J. E. BROWN

The time for the politics of per-
sonality has come to an end for
Washington and
Lee. No longer
can WA&L remain
oblivious to the
changes going on
around it, If W&L
is to remain a
viable educational
institution, it must
change quickly, or
time will pass us
by, if it has not al-
ready. In this com-
ing election, there
is a chance for the student body to
voice their desire for a change in the
present policy of the school, However
students became more aware of what
is happening on their own campus,

Dan Leonard

 

 

By DANNY LEONARD

My two years on the Executive
Committee have given me an op-
portunity to observe two entirely dif-

ferent types of
administration in
their attempts to

move this Univer-

sity forward. 1
have come to
realize that it is
necessary to com-
promise the a
mount of time
filling administra.

 

filling administra-
live duties and
making the quest
for worthwhile changes

The past two years have enabled
me to see what needs to be done
and have taught me the proper chan-
nels to move through to get things
done, My platform is tempered with
experience and realism:

1) Our Honor System which several
candidates have referred to as ap-
pearing to be working excellently
seems to me to be in serious trouble.
Students must be made more aware
of their individual responsibility for
the maintenance of a spirit of honor
or be forced to sit by and watch as
a spirit ef uneoncern destroys our

Leonard

 

present system

 

much of their voice will be dampened.
Specifically, here are some of the
problem areas students should be
familiar with and which I hope to
correct:

1) F.B.1. agents have been investi-
gating members of the Students
Against the War. Whether or not
one agrees with the aims of this
group, this a threat to free expression
of ideals for all of us. The administra-
tion policy, at present, is that no
F.B.1. agent will be given any in-
formation by the registrar, the deans,
or the faculty, unless a student ap-
plies for a federal job. All I want
the E.C. to do is to adopt a similar
resolution. Students here should at
least be concerned enough to stand up
for their own rights.

2) Students have complained of
being given a “raw deal” by some
teachers. If final exams were handed
back, they would have some proof,

3) The Student Control Commitice
passes On its peers as much as does

 

2) I call for a new approach to the
administration of student committees
such as the Library Committee and
the Assimilation Committee. Either
revamp them into worthwhile and
purposeful committees by granting
them larger roles in student govern-
ment or dissolve them.

3) This year on the Executive Com-
mittee, we managed to get some con-
cessions for more liberal exam
scheduling. Let's push for more next
year, possibly toward complete self-
scheduling.

4) We now have a University Presi-
dent in Dr. Huntley who is willing to
listen to students and who is receptive
to our ideas and opinions, | propose
the E.C. organize small monthly meet
ings between President Huntley and
student leaders to serve as an ad
ministrative forum for dealing with
student views and student problems

5) I propose a more liberal cut
system to be extended into the fresh-
man and sophomore classes,

6) Having talked with the ad-
ministration about scheduling exams
before Christmas, | learned that there
exXisis NO consensus for such a move
I don't believe this is so, I propose

 

that the E.C. adopt a resolution in
favor of rescheduling and, at the
same, get faculty members who are |
in favor of it to introduce a pro
posal for it in a faculty meeting. 1
believe we can find consensus for it

7) If a spirit of concern, a spirit
of interest, and a spirit of responsi- |

For Student Body Vice President . . .

the E.C.: therefore, it should be elect-
ed and not appointed.

4) Students should be allowed to
voice their opinions in faculty com-
mittee meetings, and the E.C. should
have a representative at monthly
faculty meetings,

5) An avenue of communication
with the Board of Trustees is needed.

6) There is an immediate need for
an equal representation for students
on the powerful Student Affairs Com-
mittee. They are presently outnumb-
ered 4 to 3.

7) The law school should adopt
the J.D. degree instead of the L.L.B.,
because it has greater prestige and
usually a higher pay scale. Further-
more, law school members should
not be required to attend university
assemblies, These people are mature
enough to make up their own minds.

There are other problems here at
WAL, but these seem to me to be
the most pressing. | would hope |
could help correct them.
bility dominated this campus rather
than one of general unconcern, |
believe we would find the faculty
much more receptive to student ideas
and opinions, Therefore, I propose
that the E.C, devote the necessary
time and energy to show students the
possible favorable alternatives if the
campus attitude were reversed through
an attempt to instill a spirit of in-
terest, a spirit of concern, and a spirit
of responsibility.

I would sincerely appreciate the op-
portunity to put this plan into action!
Thank you.

Goshen Classic Set
For Next Saturday

Can Jim Batterson regain his crown
as Tuber of the Year? Will the
Kappa Sigs field a sober entry? Will
Mickey Phillipps’ kidneys hold out?
These are some of the questions that
will be answered next Saturday after-
noon when the Friday Ring-tum Phi,
in conjunction with the W&L Repub-
lican Mock Convention, kicks off
Mock Convention Week with the
second annual running of the now
widely acclaimed Goshen Classic.

The first Goshen Classic, while
snubbed by Sports Hlustrated and the
Daily Inquirer, received such wide
regional attention that Classic officials
are predicting that this year’s event
will draw an even greater field than
the 28 intrepid souls that braved the
white waters of the Maury River last
year in the innaugural running.

Meet Director and Friday Sports
Editor Jerry Perlman is very optimistic
about this year’s running. In a Fri-
day edition exclusive interview, he
was quoted as saying, “I expect ap-
proximately 50 to 75 entrants this
year in all classes, even with the
knowledge that most of the African
nations are boycoting the event be-
cause of our refusal to bar South
Africa’s participation, My contacts

the optimum water temperature and
current speed for the event.”
Two O'clock Start

The Classic, which will begin at
2:00 p.m. Saturday, April 27 at the
upper (westernmost) picnic ground at
Goshen, will once more comprised
of three separate but simultaneously
run events. They are (1) the Down-
river Grand Slalom, for members of
the Washington and Lee student body;
(2) the Powderpuff Sweepstakes for
girls only; and (3) the President's
Trophy Race, for W&L faculty and
staff members.

Individual prizes for the winners of |

each event will be furnished by John
Norman's College Town Shop of Lex-

dinner jacket by After Six for the
Downriver Grand Slalom winner, a
twenty dollar bathing suit by Sea

champion, and a pair of Bostonian
loafers for the victor in the Presi-
dent’s Trophy Race.
Important Rule Change

In an important change from last} |

year, meet officials are excepting un-
limited entries for all three events.
However, the winner of the coveted
title “Tube Team of the Year,” will
be awarded as it has been in the
past: on a two-man team basis as
part of the Downriver Grand Slalom.
The two fastest tubers from each of
WAL’s 18 fraternities, the Francis P.
Gaines Society, and the W&L Student
Bar Association, will represent their
respective organizations, the winning
team receiving a keg of beer for his
group.

who will be participating in the first Washington and Lee Rugby Tournament,
to be held tomorrow and Sunday on Wilson Field. Other teams taking part
in the event are Lynchburg College and Duke University, Villanova Uni-
versity slated to be the fourth entry, cancelled last week because of injuries
and travel complications. The Generals will meet Lynchburg at 4:30 p.m.
tomorrow on Wilson Field, and the winner meets top-seeded Duke Sunday
at 2:00 p.m., that game also to be played on the Wilson Field turf. Trophies
will be awarded to the first and second place teams, and a permanent cup, the

Neer Topples

By STUART PORTER

The Washington and Lee cinder-
' !'men overpowered a relatively small
Lynchburg College team, 91-53, for
their second consecutive win of the
season, Wednesday on Wilson Field.
Mike Neer continued his record-
| breaking high jumping ways, setting
a new school record at six feet, four-
and three-quarters inches. In an at-
tempt to greatly improve his high
jumping, Neer did not participate in
his three other usual events.

Sweep Shot

The Generals jumped out to an
early lead by sweeping all three places
in the shotput. Phil Jones placed first
with a 43’3'%” heave, followed by
Doug Deaton and Earl Edwards. W&L
retained this lead throughout the
meet, although the score was only
12-11 after the third event.

The Big Blue also swept the only
other one-sided event of the meet,
the 120-yard high hurdles, which was
won by Dave Ennis with a time of
16 seconds. He was followed closely
by Drew Thomas and Mike Stevens.
Thomas later came back to win the
440-yard intermediate hurdles with a
time of 1:02.2.

W&L had a much better showing
in the field events than in those on
the track, capturing at least a first
place in each of the former. Don
Sharpe won the javelin with a throw
of 151’, Doug Deaton took the discus

 

with a 131° 11” hurl, John Lawrence
won the pole vault, and Neer and

 

Thinclads Beat Hornets;

Own Record

Jones won their previously mention-
ed events.
More Firsts

Others capturing firsts for the home
team were Bill Kahn in the long
jump, Bob Armstrong in the 440-
dash, and Corbet Bryant in the mile
run.

Sam Hinkle, usually a big winner
for W&L, was up against some stiff
competition in the persons of Mssrs.
Driscoll and Toms, who together took
three firsts and two seconds. Hinkle
did manage, however, to take third
in the 100 and 200-yard dashes.

Second places for the Generals
were taken by Bob Stack in the mile,
Bob Bigham in the 440-yard dash,
Greg Crampton in the discus, Jay
Passavant in the javelin, Bob Jenson
in the 880-yard run, and Mike Stevens
in the 440-yard intermediate hurdles.

By ROY CARLTON

Washington and Lee's bid for
athletic immortality died in the clos-
ing second of yesterday's lacrosse
game on Wilson Field. W&L’s illustri-
ous Generals were fighting tooth and
nail with mighty Notre Dame! Nobody
could really believe a tiny institution
nestled in the Shenandoah Valley
could defeat the world’s greatest
athletic powerhouse, or could they?
For quite a while the impossible look-
ed possible.

Not that the Generals couldn't have
done it (if anything, they were favor-
ed), but there has to be an element
of brilliance in the thought of W&L

toppling the Irish. The Blue fought
hard the whole game, and for most
of the fourth quarter were locked in
a 5-5 tie. However the visitors scored
two opportunistic goals within five
minutes, seized a commanding lead,
and managed to stave off a late WAL
rally for a 7-6 win.
Beefy Irish

Bolstered by a few members of
their football squad, ND was an
extremely strong team. Their game
reflected this whenever the ball was
on the ground. Strength is not every-
thing, though, and the Generals show-
ed that by scooping up 82 ground
balls to Notre Dame's 53.

Funny thing, WAL also outshot the
Fighting Irish 40-23. In fact, cut out
the scoring plays, and the Blue were
definitely outplaying the _ visitors,
Then, what happened?

Even if the Generals were the best |
lacrosse team in the country, they
wouldn't be perfect. And that was
the problem yesterday. Notre Dame
invariably capitalized on WAL's mis-
takes with disastrous results.

The Generals got off to an early
lead on goals by Chip Chew and
Whit Morril. It looked like it was
their day. But the Irish responded
quickly, as Metzger scored two goals
within a twenty-second span. Now
the boisterous stands on Wilson be-
gan to quiet down.

Blue Claws Back

Notre Dame scored once more in
the first quarter and twice early in
the second. As the quarter neared
an end, it looked as if the Fighting
Irish might make the game a run

away. Then at 3:30 Tom Pittman
came racing across the field and
scored on a beautiful shot. Chew
added his second goal of the day

with nine seconds left, and the Gen-
erals were back to 5-4,

Washington and Lee showed iis
superiority throughout the third quart
er, but seemed unable to score, Fin
ally with 1:34 left Pittman scored
again to tie things up, That's the way
things stood of the fourth
quarter, until the roof fell in

After gaining possession behind the
goal, Charlie Stewart cleared the ball
out in front of the goal to a middie,
but an Irish attackman, Stoehr, step

most

score into the nets, With
1:42 left to play, Goalie Dave John

The question is not one of objectives
or goals, We all want W&L to provide
its students with the best possible
education. The question is rather one
of finding solutions, It is a question
of investigating new approaches and
new ideas.

I spent last year studying economics
in England; I studied and lived under
the tutorial system—an educational
system and philosophy completely dif-
ferent from our own. Through this
experience I gained insight into many
of W&L’s problems that I otherwise
would not have been able to obtain.
I think I can offer the EC some new
ideas and new approaches to old
problems.

1 only ask for your consideration;
I only promise my best effort. 1 be-
lieve that meaningful progress can be
made in all of the areas | have men-
tioned. But only with your help and
support—the help and support of all
of you—will this progress be possible.

burgh has been shortchanged.”

Anther factor is the fact that there
are “very few students from Ohio
and West Virginia” because of the
Indiana primary campaign.

Keegin explained that the Penn-
sylvania contest, which will end with
the primary election Tuesday, is “not
a primary such as those in Indiana,
Wisconsin, and New Hampshire,
where the delegates are linked to the
primary vote.” In Pennsylvania “they
are not committed to the candidate
who wins in the primary.”

Stickmen Lose To Irish
(Continued on page 3)

Brouder broke downfield, skirted a
defender and tossed a shot into the
empty net.

WAL staged a last gasp rally in the
final two minutes when the Irish
were two men down. Breaking from
behind the net, Chew scored a diffi-
cult angle shot for his third goal.
Despite constant pressure though, ND
goalie Dan Kammer hung on to the
one-goal margin.

Dance Board Applications

The Dance Board will accept ap-
plications for positions on next year's

for vice-president. Rising juniors and
seniors may apply for floor commit-
tee chairman, publicity chairman, sec-
retary, or coordinator of decorations.

Faverman stressed the need for

Simmons said that the EC should
be a more active initiator in all

advocated a central committee to in-

dent exchange program. This would
allow for an exchange of ideas and
systems with other colleges and uni-
versities. This could be done by send-
ing representatives to other schools—
such as Davidson, Amherst, Haver-
ford, etc., and having these schools
send representatives to W&L for a
few days. A discussion with the repre-
sentatives at the student forum would
greatly benefit W&L. This type of
exchange would allow the student
body criteria in the form of actual
comparison for more constructive
criticism of the policies of the faculty
and administration, This would have
the twofold effect of lessening the
isolation which seems to make W&L
an island away from the mainland
of colleges and universities and of
adding greater strength to the “student
voice” at W&L.

I feel that WAL’s potential is great,
and | hope that you will allow me
to work toward this greatness as stu-
dent body secretary.

(By the author of “Rally Round the Flag, Boys!”,
“Dobie Gillis,” ete.)

WAS KEATS THE BOB DYLAN
OF HIS DAY?

Who was the greatest of the English Romantic Poets—
Byron, Shelley or Keats? This question has given rise to
many lively campus discussions and not a few stabbings.
Let us today try to find an answer.

First, Keats (or The Louisville Slugger, as he is com-
monly called.) Keats’ talent bloomed early. While still a
schoolboy at St. Swithin’s he wrote his epic lines:

If lam good 1 get anapple,

So I don’t whistle in the chapel.

From this distinguished beginning he went on to write
another 40 million poems, an achievement all the more re-
markable when you consider that he was only five feet
tall! I mention this fact only to show that physical prob-
lems never keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for
example, was lame. Shelley suffered from prickly heat all
winter long. Nonetheless, these three titans of literature
never stopped writing poetry for one day.

Nor did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a devil
with the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for dipping
Nell Gwynne’s pigtails in an inkwell. (This later became
known as Guy Fawkes Day.) He left England to fight in
the Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and
well, but women were never far from his mind, as evi-
denced by these immortal lines :

How splendid it is to fight for the Greek,

But I don’t enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to
cheek.

While Byron fought in Greece, Shelley stayed in Eng-
land, where he became razor sharpener to the Duke of
Gloucester. Shelley was happy in his work, as we know
from his classic poem, Hail to thee, blithe strop, but no
matter how he tried he was never able to get a proper edge
on the Duke’s razor, and he was soon banished to
Coventry. (This later became known as The Industrial
Revolution. )

One wonders how Shelley's life—and the course of Eng-
lish poetry—would have differed if Personna Super Stain-
less Steel Blades had been invented 200 years earlier. For
Personna is a blade that needs no stropping, honing or
whetting. It’s sharp when you get it, and sharp it stays
through shave after luxury shave. Here truly is a blade
fit for a Duke or a freshman. Moreover, this Personna,
this jewel of the blade-maker’s art, this boon to the cheek
and bounty to the dewlap, comes to you both in double-
edge style and Injector style. Get some now during “Be
Kind to Your Kisser Week.”

But I digress. Byron, I say, was in Greece and Shelley
in England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to
grow. Who does not remember his wistful lyric:

Although I am only five feet high,

Some day I will look in an elephant’s eye.

But Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron,
touched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This
too failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies man, took up with
Lucrezia Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oakley.
Shelley, a more domestic type, stayed home with his wife
Mary and wrote his famous poem:

1 love to stay home with the missus and write,

And hug her and kiss her and give her a bite.

 

Mary Shelley finally got so tired of being bitten that

she went into another room and wrote Frankenstein
Upon reading the manuscript, Shelley and Byren got so
scared they immediately booked passage home to Eng-
land Keats tried to go too, but } Wis #0 am ill that the

clerk at the steamship office couldn't see him over the top
of the counter. So Keata remained in Rome and died of
shortness.

Byron and Shelley cried » lot and then together com-
posed this immortal epitaph
Good old Keata, he might have heen abort,
Rut he wasagreat Amer cananda!l k of a good rport
¢ 7 . ° ‘ “an

Truth, not poetry, is the concern of Personne, and we
tell you truly that you'll not find a better shaving com-
bination than Personna and HurmaShaee, regular or

menthol.

The percentage voting was not
especially high for a Big Four election
because there were very few issues
to provoke a large turnout. 74.7%
of the students participated in the
election.

The present EC cited Article Il,
Section B, Part 3 of the student body

 

 

 

constitution in its decision to conduct
another election for the office of
president.

“If no simple majority is obtained
by a candidate, there shall be a run-
off election between the two candi-
dates receiving the largest number of
votes.”

The runoff race is the first in recent
history and possibly the first in the
history of the school. Prior to 1965
the “Party Caucuses” selected candi-
dates and there were rarely more
than two in any major race.

There had been some questioning
of last Thursday's primary in the
form of a letter from John Paul, a
law student. The EC disallowed his
argument on the grounds that there
was no specific prohibition in the
student body constitution of primaries.

Foreign Study

A year abroad? Or a semester, or
even a summer? Such a program, run
by Washington and Lee, does not
yet exist. Yet there are still many
possibilities for the WAL student to
study abroad and to receive credit for |
his work. President Huntley has ex-
pressed his approval of the value of
study abroad for students in foreign
languages, other fields of the humani-
ties and the social sciences in well
organized programs co-ordinated by
the Foreign Study Committee.

Various programs now in existence
und sponsored by other colleges and

universities are open to WAL appli-
cants, WAL’'s Foreign Study Com
mittee urges interested students to

investigate them. Students contemplat-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

Tuesday, April 23, 1968

 

Still another ‘theatre’- building disaster
(fast becoming a regular column,

to be called ‘Bringing Down the House’)

Another incident in our local version of the seven plagues
of Egypt: the squalid, obnoxious building which around here
is laughingly called a “theatre’’ caught fire Saturday evening—
while there were several people inside it. Mercifully, the fire
was put out before it had a chance to spread and kill. By the
way, this latest episode is not to be confused with the times,
all of them during this academic year, when the ground floor
was flooded by its own sprinkler system, triggered off by its
own heating system; or when a tree fell down upon the build-
ing and caved in part of the roof while play rehearsals were
going on; or when part of the insides fell down onto a student
worker, sending him to the hospital.

It seems it’ll be a race against time, to see whether the
building crumbles to dust (hopefully, when nobody is in it)
before the new little theatre can be constructed several years
from now; or even before the $35,000 addition, of a lobby and
the building’s very first bathrooms, is completed (the addition
is being built right now, in efforts to make the place a little
less Dogpatch-ish until we have the new theatre).

—_—__ oo -——_——_——_——

We wrote those first two paragraphs before learning that
the fire was not accidental. The building is so remarkably
decrepit that one automatically assumes it’s an act of nature
when parts of it crumble and collapse, or sink into the earth,
or burn down. It is impossible for us to even imagine what sort
of madman it was who amused himself by playing games with
gasoline in that particular building, the world’s most likely
tinder-box.

Work Begins

Lobby construction well under way.

On Additions

For The Troub’s Theater

The Lexington Housing Authority
will soon be able to scratch another
sub-standard building off its con-
demnation list. The Troubadour
rheatre has for years been cited for
its lack of restrooms and proper heat-
ing, which brought discomfort and
dismay to the audience and perform-
ers. But on March 26, construction
was begun to eliminate these defi-
ciences plus greatly increasing the
floor space.

The first addition is a lobby with
an adjoining lighting and sound
booth. Upon completion of major
portions of this addition, the con-
struction of a Troubadour workshop
will begin. Troub Director Lee Kahn
summed up his joy over the new con-
struction with “Hallelujah! Hallelu-
jah! At long last.”

New Lobby

Now well under construction is the
lobby which will have a large new
ticket desk, restrooms, a coatroom,
and display cases. The display cases
will contain pictures of past perform-
ances plus selections from the historic
Reeves Collection of Colonial porce-
lain.

Bricks have been selected to blend
in as well as possible with the present
building. The lobby will be a little
over a story high with the roof reach-
ing to the present second floor win-

dows. Surrounding the new addition
will be a patio extending partially
into the old parking lot next to the
Town Inn. To reach this patio and
the new entrance to the theatre, steps
will be built on Henry Street next to
the Sigma Nu house.

Equipment for the lighting and
sound booth has already been secured,
although at least two new dimmers
may be necessary, according to Mr.
Kahn.

New Workshop

The new workshop will branch off
to the left of the theater front on
Main Street. The new building will
be 30 x 30, large enough to be used
for storage, scenery construction and
stage left during performances. This
section will also contain a modern,
quiet heating system capable of
comfortably heating the entire theater.

Mr. Kahn will be able to have two
classes at once now due to a gift
from Mr. Bernard Schecter of New
York. Mr, Schecter’s gift to the theater
is two massive sound-proof doors to
separate the workshop from the
theatre. When these doors are closed
there will be no interference between
directing or scenery classes.

These improvements to the theater,
plus earlier additions of seats and

 

— are estimated by Mr. Kahn

to have a cost of nearly $35,000.

 

Then And Now: How To
Pick Publications Editors

By BOB KEEFE

This is an anniversary week: the
thirtieth time the Publications Board
has met to select editor-in-chief and
business managers for the Ring-tum
Phi and for the University’s yearbook
and student magazines.

A constitutional amendment, tak-
ing the top publications positions out
of the sordid, semi-open arena of
general elections and putting them
under the aegis of the Publications
Board, was passed nearly unanimously
(the Clique whips were off this amend-
ment) in 1937, to go into effect in
1938.

In the beginning (so far as we
can tell)—prior to about 1900—the
heads of each publication named their
successors as they saw fit, privately
and on their own, in secret and prob-
ably graft-filled sessions.

The Collegian was at that time run
by the literary societies, which pre-
sumably elected editors and managers,
There is no telling what the Calyx
did, there having been no chronicle,
reliable or otherwise, of such W&L
activities before 1897 and the advent
of the Ring-tum Phi.

Birth of the R-t Phi

The Ring-tum Phi itself was begun
by one J, Slusser as a private money-
making venture; he served as business
manager, and reportedly the job paid
his way through school. He and his
editor named their successors intra-
murally at first, too,

Then, somewhere early in the new
century, somebody realized that these
six plums—three editors and three
business managers—ought to be put
on the political tree. So the publica-
tion positions were thrown open to
the general public.

Almost immediately, things began
to degenerate. The Ring-tum Phi
suffered least, but even it was buffeted
now and again by the blatant lack of
capability of some editors who were
elected because of football ability and
general popularity with no regard to
journalistic fitness.

Birth of the Board

In 1920, the six publication heads
had begun to see what could happen
if elections continued as so many free-
for-alls. In a sort of apprehension,
they banded together and formed the
Publications Board; it had no power
at first, and hoped only to exercise
informal, sobering influence.

Things came to a head a little while
later. One man came a hair's breadth
from being elected: although he was
a transfer student and had been here
only four months and had never once

The Police Are On Our Side

By LARRY HONIG

It was Springs Weekend, and as|

there are several instances in
which students have aided police in

usual the Lexington police were cruis- | the apprehension of criminals (a re-
ing around party areas looking f0F | cont clothing store case), in testimony

certs looking for drunks, and patrol- | especially in community service pro-

ling the fraternity houses for drunks, | jects. As Rhodenizer says about Greek
right? Wrong,

 

Police Chief A. E. (AD Rhodenizer
had the entire force on duty this
weekend, and designated two of the
city’s three police cars to cover the
University area, but the primary pur-
pose was to prevent the stealing of
personal property which has plagued
the police for weeks after dance week-
ends.

he thieves come from all surround-
ing counties and steal anything: cars
(12 so far this year), stereo tapes ($175
worth are in Rhodenizer's office await-
ing claim), suitcases ($1,300 at last
year's Fancy Dress), and pocketbooks,
which are stolen the most frequently

several each weekend

“Taxpayers’ Tuition”?

And such larceny is a major prob-
lem, especially in comparison to the
relative size of the Washington and
Lee student body, Rhodenizer is fully
aware that the presence of police will
discourage potential thieves, but in
sists that the main responsibility for

prevention lies with the students
themselves: “It's not fair to spend
the taxpayers’ money on something
the students themselves could pre
vent,”

But the taxpayers

it would be foolish to insist that
the police have no concern with of

no problems caused by students—yet

Rhodenizer is quick to add thal stu
denis are involved in very little
trouble

In fact, this writer was surprised

at the degree and volume of praise

| Week, “How many citizens would get
out and clean up a messy playground
area?”

As for the frequently heard com-
plaint that police are unfair, the 43-
year-old Chief says “If I had an
officer who was picking on students,
or any other group of people, |
wouldn't stand for it.”

Once Upon A Time...

The Police Department, attractively
housed in City Hall, has greatly im-
proved its efficiency since the post-
war years, In 1946, police were hailed

 

 

on the street (walking or driving the |

Lexington Chief of Potice A. FE. Rhodenizer in his office at
| Department in City Hall,

only police car) or summoned by bells
on utility poles, The “office” consisted
of a nine by twelve room; there were
no communications and one pair of
handcuffs for cight officers.

Now there are fifteen officers,
three cars, a motorcycle, and equip-
ment commensurate with modern

police technology for a city of Lex-
ington’s size.

Youngest In The State

Joining the force in 1946 as partrol-
man, Rhodenizer was promoted to
sergeant and then to the first appoint-
ment in Lexington of a first liewtenant.
At the age of 22, he was named Chief
by the Mayor and the City Council
in 1949,

The Chief requires all his men to
attend the Central Police Training
School in Richmond, and his officers’
training is continuous in the Super-
visors’ School.

 

 

set foot in the newspaper office, he
was an immensely popular football
player and therefore gathered 49 per
cent of the vote.

Meantime, the editors who had been
elected were putting out papers that
were progressively growing shakier.
They would take off for weekends
occasionally, and there just wouldn't
be a Phi at all the following week.
The issues that were published were
more and more becoming organs for
certain fraternities, political points of
view, and honor groups.

So the Publications Board proposed
an amendment to the Constitution—
it would endorse two experienced
candidates for each publication office,
and the student body would choose
betwen them. No blatantly unexperi-
enced man could run and win, the
Board thought; the chances of in-
competence and inefficiency would be
minimized; and yet the electoral fac-
tor would remain to assuage the
politicians’ consciences.

‘Fundamental Necessity’

The Ring-tum Phi, ably edited by
A. C. Kelley, was almost fanatically
in favor of the amendment, Being on
the inside, Kelley said, he could not
fail to see the fundamental necessity
of limiting editorial and business-
managerial candidacies to men with
some experience, who could reason-
ably be expected to put out an ac-
ceptable _publication—which was
proven in the past, almost disastrously,
not to be the case with open elections.

 

Why the Ring-tum Phi
Never Got Out On Time
In the Old Days

Besides the quality of the paper it-
self, the argument ran, there was
virtually no channel of responsibility.
The elected editor was supreme. It
was grossly impractical to suppose
that the student body would initiate
a recall if an inexperienced editor
committed an irresponsible act. Sev-
eral of the elected editors were journ-
alism majors, and it could be pre-
sumed that they would be careful;
but there was no guarantee or even
reasonable assurance. The transfer
student who came within 12 votes of
being elected had no qualifications at
all.

So the amendment was passed over-
whelmingly. The student body had
grown sick of certain years in which
there were no papers, late papers and
scandal papers.

Back Dowahill

For a while, everything went de-
cently. Capable editors and business
managers were elected for all three
publications. But in the late 20's and
early "30's, quality again started going
downhill. The Clique ran politics here
then; the Clique decided who was
going to edit and manage the publica-
tons.

The Publications Board endorse-
ments came to be such a farce that
the Clique would nominate its candi-
date a week or more before the Publi-
cations Board even met to give its
“endorsement.” Even the Clique-ap-
pointed editors ridiculed the system
Latham Weber, Clique-member editor
in 1937 (ater director of publicity
at WAL), periodically voiced the need
for basic reform in the system that
had appointed him

Editors came and went, When one
displeased the Clique in 1934, he
simply disappeared from further con-
nection with the paper. His name was
removed from the staff box, and a
more loyal Cliquer was named “act
ing editor” for the rest of the year

moved from politics, “ex-Cliqueman

Towson Wins In 2nd Overtime

 

Saturday afternoon, the lacrosse
team dropped a double-overtime de-
cision to Towson State, 6 to 4. It
was the Generals’ fourth loss of the
season as compared with one victory.

Coach Szlasa said that his players
did a good job: “I couldn't ask any
more ... | was pleased with their
effort.” Towson possessed an except-
ionally fine goalie as he blocked shot
after shot. The Generals’ defense also
did an excellent job, but just couldn't
hold Towson. Bill Brumback, Harold
Stowe, Charlie Stewart and Dave
Johnson were cited by Coach Szlasa
for their determination and good play.

In the first overtime both sides
went scoreless but in the second, with

214 elapsed minutes, Towson managed | |

to score. With only a short time re-
maining the Generals had to cast
caution to the wind and desperately

try to tie the score again. This re- |
sulted in another score for Towson. |
Tom Pittman led the Generals’)

scoring with three; Joe Wich got the |

other one. Assists were earned by Bob
Frost, Hugh Baugher, and Chip Chew.

Though their 1-4 record isn't as
good as they had hoped for the
lacrosse team's spirits are still high
for finishing up the season with a

winning record. It would mean wine

Washington College, Duke, Roanoke,
and U.Va. They have the talent to
do it, all they need is a little luck
and a great deal of determination.
As Coach Szlasa

 

said about the |

Towson game “they did everything
but win.” Maybe that last element will
be included in the next four games.
A little support might go along way
towards helping them; there should
be something to a home advantage
besides a familiar field.

 

As Roanoke College was grinding
out a 75-61 victory over the Generals,

day. Both meets are at home.

Coach Canfield’s netmen boosted ,
their season record to 4-1 with a 6-3/
win over Randolph Macon last Fri-
day afternoon. The match was played |
at Macon under clear skies which |
seemed to favor the Generals as they

first four singles matches and the!
second and third doubles.

Coach Canfield had a great deal |
of praise for all his players but
singled out Tommy Rueger and Don
McClure for particularly fine efforts. |
“Rueger’s desire to win was instru-
mental in our victory:” “fine effort on
the part of McClure.” McClure who!
as a junior is in his third year on the
varsity is the only undefeated member
of the squad. Don was the only player:

man hall with a living room, and so
forth.)

Would parietal rules have to be
modified; and if to what extent?
What provisions, if any, would have
to be made for entertaining dates in
dorm rooms? Where does the reason-
able compromise lie between students’
wishes and the University’s responsi-
bilities?

Would any upperclassmen at all
have to be required to live in dorms?
Would it be to the University’s
advantage to offer attractive dormi-
tories as an addition to rather than
as a restriction on the choices students
now have?

Would the academic atmosphere
of the University be enhanced by our
becoming a residential college?

Closely related is the question of
whether the University must make an
irrevocable decision concerning
whether or not to prohibit non-fra-
ternity-house, non-dorm housing be-
fore at least some dorms could be
constructed.

Other entangling questions tied up
with these observations: If dorm rules
were modified, what corresponding
changes would have to be made in
fraternity-house rules? With so many
other irons in the fire, just where
should dorms be placed on the priority
list? Where does the point of equi-
librium lie between a worthwhile in-
vestment and students’ liberty of
choice? How lavish could dorms be
and still rent out for reasonable sums?

Law School Stages
Mock Assault Trial

Tuesday, April 30, at 1:00 p.m.,
the semi-annual mock trial will be
presented by the law school in the
Rockbridge County Court House,
Judge Holstein presiding.

This spring's case involves the al-
leged rape of Miss Priscilla Good-
body by one Miles Standish. The
prosecution’s case will be handled
by C. L. Kinder, with assistance from
Clem Ryan, both intermediate law
students, while Bill Boardman, also
of the second year class will attempt
to exculpate Standish.

As in the past law students will
serve as witnesses and the jury will
be comprised of members of the Lex-
ington citizenry. The trial is open, and
the Mock Trial Committee has em-
phasized that everyone's is invited.

The mock trial is an institution of
long standing at W&L. Its primary
purpose is to give aspiring lawyers
an opportunity to ply their prospective
trades under simulated trial condi-
tions. The trial is exclusively the

Jay Passavant, receiving over 51
per cent of the vote in Thursday’s
election, was declared the student body
president-elect over Herb Crenshaw.

Passavant’s vote total was 521 com-
pared to Crenshaw’s 445, Of the
1011 votes cast, 45 were write-ins.
In the general election held Monday,
Passavant led but was unable to claim
an absolute majority of the 953 votes
cast, There were 33 write-ins, mostly
for Jeff Wexler, the candidate who was

eliminated in the primary election
last Thursday, April 18.

Early Thursday morning a letter
was circulated endorsing Crenshaw
and signed by five members of the
student body Executive Committee, of
which Crenshaw is one of the two
members from the junior class this
year. Crenshaw, a member of ODK,
the president of Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity and a Dean’s List student,
was the president of the sophomore

 

class in 1966-67. His campaign, and
the letter supporting him, was based
on his experience in dealing with the
Honor System.

A letter signed by Mike Hosford
answered the charges of the Cren-
shaw supporters by saying that the
present EC was just trying to per-
petuate itself and that experience on
this year’s EC was of “limited im-
portance, since not one piece of
major legislation was passed.” He

with the Visting Scholars Program.

He has taught at Fisk University

He has authored numerous treatises

and essays, including “Economic

In Election Rematch With Crenshaw

went on to remind the student body
that the present Director of Financial
Aid for W&L, William A. Noell, was
elected with no previous experience.

This runoff race is the first in re-
cent history and may be the first in
the history of the school. Until 1965
the candidates were selected by party
caucuses and there were rarely more
than two for any major race, thus
eliminating the situation which kept
Passavant or Crenshaw from compil-
ing the necessary majority required
by the constitution in the Monday
election. The EC then ruled that
whoever won a plurality in Trus-

day’s election would be declared the
winner.

Arid Discussions

Anyone who has seriously followed the electioneering of
the past week must have come to the conclusion by now that
politicking at W&L is properly the art of the splendid cliche.
Every candidate, whether he really understands what he’s say-
ing or not, always has plenty to say about “getting W&L mov-
ing again,” “lack of communication,” “conservatism,” etc.,
etc. We may, if we wish, blame the politicos for it all; but then,
blaming the politicos has become as much a cliche as the rest,
and in the end we would only be blaming them for picking up
the cliches that have become standard in what passes for con-
cerned thought at W&L.

So many ideas, so many discoveries that were intensely
meaningful when they were first formulated have been worn
down by endless repetition to the point where they have be-
come automatic responses to given problems. Once reduced
to this stage, far gone from the intentions and meanings which
their creators originally had for them, they become part of a
pool of dogma available to every political platform and bull
session—a pool from which they seldom re-emerge into mean-
ing.

The marvel of the cliche is that it can fix absolute values so
simply. That The Fraternity System Is Good or that The Fra-
ternity System Is Bad are judgments made every day in the co-
op with equal conviction and equal disregard of whether it is in
fact good or bad or a little of both or neither, or of what
exactly is bad and good to whom and for whom. But it’s so
much simpler to use the cliche. The moment you say it you
are in immediate communication with anyone who hears you
and who recognizes your cliche as belonging to the public pool.
And if he returns another cliche, whether he agrees with you
or not, both of you feel in safe and well-known territory. You
may even get into quite a heated argument, and never have to
abandon whatever group of cliches constitutes your philosophy.
In a pinch, you can even prove your point with a student body
poll—a poll at W&L being the sum total of persons who check
a box for one neatly-typed cliche as against the number of
those checking another one. A more arid and misleading dis-
cussion can hardly be imagined; and yet, the majority of the
discussions on this campus about the character and future of
W&L are conducted in exactly this way.

Very few issues escape the murder we commit on them.
Perhaps discussion of the war has been freer here than other
discussions (at least, most of the cliches started out in Wash-
ington, not here) but the war was a great deal more personal
to us than any campus issue is likely to be. Last year, briefly
and for a few individuals, discussion of the fraternity system
may have reached a meaningful level, but the ideas presented
then have for the most part been drained of any significance,
and are now no more than the cliches of one “concerned” mi-
nority among many. For the rest, we hear only cliche after
cliche: Professor X is trivial, Professor Y is a great man, maxi-
mum student power is good, limited student power is bad, con-
servatism is bad, liberalism is good, the Troub Theatre is
inadequate, the library is inadequate, the University is inade-
quate—that is the sort of thing with which we so often set out
to “get W&L moving again.” Professor X may really be trivial,
the theater may really be inadequate, but who bothers to look
beneath the cliche long enough to make a fair evaluation of
Professor X? Who but a Troub really knows what he’s talking
about when he repeats that the theatre is inadequate?

We could pass all this off if it at least did not do active
harm, but when it is demanded of student and administration
leaders that they act in accord with the supposed wishes of
the student body, then the cliches are elevated to the status
of policies. The uproar over ending Saturday classes is typical.

There are plenty of people around campus to complain
that there is no discussion of vital topics among the student
body as a whole, But who can blame serious students for
rejecting discussion about subjects which they may instinctively
feel to be nonsense, given the context of hack phrases in which
such subjects are argued. So often—too often—discussion
gets us nowhere; cliches by their very nature are sterile, ex-
cept to breed more cliches. Gentlemen, we don’t need more
discussion. We need more thoughtful discussion.

THE RING-TUM PHI

e

By LESLIE SMITH

Open Letter to the Ring-tum Phi:

Whither goes Washington and Lee?
In light of its recent history, the
official response of this university to
the tragic slaying of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. was most gratifying. The
quiet memorial service in Lee Chapel,
attended by those who came to ex-
press their goodwill, was in part a
recognition that they shared a com-
mon humanity with this man of peace.
Martyred in Memphis, his eloquent
voice, which was raised so many times
in the cause of social justice, is now
silent. But what of those principles
for which he lived? What is the role
of universities like W&L in the lessen-
ing of racial tensions and the pro-
moting of social justice? Can_ this
university become a model of the
kind of society men of goodwill hope
to build? We have made a significant
beginning at Washington and Lee,
but our integration is token and the
sincerity of our commitment is there-
fore open to question. Part of the
tragedy of Memphis was the failure
of white America to understand the
depth of our problems and to deal
effectively with them. It was a failure
even to recognize them in their true
light. It was a failure that will be
repeated so long as there is a re-
fusal to recognize the legitimacy of
Negro aspirations.

Yet, the winds of change have be-
gun to blow here. Under President
Cole, W&L broke with “tradition”
and instituted a policy of “open” ad-
missions. Mr. Huntley, our new and

‘. .. winds of change have begun to blow here.”

Can W&L Help Halt Racial Tension?

energetic president, for whom this
writer has much respect and admira-
tion, shows great promise in the
clarity of his perception as to what
WAL is now and can become in the
future. Under his leadership there is
hope of our becoming a truly na-
tional center of learning rather than
a center of Southern provincialism.
We face now a new test of commit-
ment. A more diversified student body
is greatly needed. The present student
body is too homogeneous, its values
unchallenged and unenriched by con-
tact with the unfamiliar. Next year,
the level of integration at W&L is
expected to go up. Yet there seems
to be little awareness, especially on
the part of student leaders, of the
difficulties that remain to be over-
come. The question is one of how
we can assure all students that they
will find an open community of
scholars and gentlemen, that their
success here will be limited only by
their own capabilities, and that there
will be full participation in the life of
this university. And what of the fra-
ternity system and the great obstacle
that it will present in achieving this
goal? This is only one of the diffi-
culties, there are others just as dis-
turbing. The commitment of the ad-
ministration alone is not enough to
achieve success here. There is a need
for strong courageous student leader-
ship. The present EC has failed to
provide that leadership. Messrs, Nash,
Faulk and Kline et al have main-
tained an unbroken silence on the
question of further integration here.

 

The composition and attitude of the

 

By PLEAS GEYER

“Why are you going to Atlanta?”
Many times I heard the question.
And I couldn't answer. Why indeed?
What could my additional presence
accomplish there among so many?
Surely nothing. Did I go to mourn?
Yes, of course! But what has geo-
graphy to do with mourning? Why
go to Atlanta? I couldn't answer .. .
yet I had to go. The questions galled
me and I had to go.

I am standing amid a mass of
other people, all preparing to march
in mourning for the incomprehensible
slaughter of a peaceful man—perhaps
as wholesome a man as our race will
ever know. I am standing here. I
look at the others. They eye me
back. I look down and shift my
weight. I feel uneasy. They are at
a distance. WHY? All of us here
for a common purpose but still
fragmented. WHY? And with that
question came jeering back all the
the others, all running into this one.
WHY? An anger rose within me.
WHY? A self-directed anger. WHY?

And then there was an answer.
Somewhere within me, within us,
there was a seed, bred in my case
by southern grandparents and north-
ern suburban environment, that de-

sired a distance, that shrank from

communion, that felt different. It was
not hatred, not even distrust, only
their seed. Beneath reason, beyond
sensibility, it lay, robbing us all of
spontaneous identity, forcing our in-
sulted selves to squint furtively out
of eye-corners. This was what I had
come to be shown—that this seed was
in me also. This was the urgency that
had dragged me here—that I was
not only a mourner of death, but
a participant in the forces that gen-
erated the death I grieved for.

“Let's march, man.” It was a tall
young Negro behind me. He grinned.
“Come on, baby. Join hands and let's
go.” I smiled back as my anger eased,
I held out my hands on either side,
and people took them, firmly. Then
we walked and with every step my
anger eased. With every step I felt
an irrepressible calm replacing the
urgency that was gradually seeping
away. I seemed to be walking away
from that seed and its constraint. And
we sang.

“Deep in my heart... 1 do
believe . . . that we shall overcome
someday.”

This too I came to be shown. That
a man can root out this seed, the
dregs of his being, with every step,
cast it behind him with every step,
and walk away from it .. . with

new EC is not yet known, but they
would serve their university well, if
they are able to see beyond the glass
menagerie view of this university that
seems so prevalent here. For history
will sit in judgment as to whether we
meet our responsibilities as a uni-
versity toward the achievement of
better race relations, both on this
campus and the world beyond Red
Square. We can no longer retreat
behind a wall of silence. Neither can
we sit on “the hill” unmoved by the
turbulence of modern society.

As a first step, this writer proposes
to the new elected leaders: (1) That
they endorse and support a vigorous
recruitment program to the end that
diversity may be achieved here; (2)
That they endorse and promote a
policy of “fair employment” in regard
to administrative, secretarial as well
as faculty appointments; (3) That they

promote review of the salary scale of
non-academic employees; (4) That
they undertake a study of how this
university can best allocate its human
and economic resources to the eradica-
tion of black and white poverty in
Rockbridge County. This is at best
only a partial listing of what Wash-
ington and Lee can do if its commit-
ment is to be more than an ex-
ercise in tokenism. As students, we
have a unique responsibility to show
that W&L’s commitment is genuine.
We can provide part of the answer
to where we are going. If this uni-
versity demonstrates a generosity of
spirit, we open the way to creative
dialogue in confronting our problems,
and we show forth the best of our
heritage from the past and the best
of our hopes for the future.

Letter to the Editor...

Dear Sir:

In light of the recently publicized
moves of the University of Virginia's
Human Relations Council to end all
forms of segregation at that Uni-
versity, W&L has once again been
shown to be both backward and
somewhat hypocritical in its own
policies. We have token integration—
and only that. In other fields of con-
cern we still use segregated facilities
and are apparently making no attempt
to remedy this. To this end, | would
suggest several changes which should
be made publicly in official univer-
sity policy and then carried out.

1) To actively work toward en-
couraging young men of not only
the Negro race but of other races
as well to attend Washington and
Lee, and to also seek new professors
and instructors from all races. This
would be intended not only to help
the disadvantaged but to provide the
university with more of a balanced
student body and faculty. Not only
scholarships but a change in admis-
sions policies and a tutorial program
might be established to accomplish
this.

2) To refuse university co-opera-

3) To allow academic credit to be
given for participation in a human
relations and human problems course
which would involve not only class-
room work, but also, if possible, work
with the local poverty programs, In-
terest encouraged in this area by the
university would be as valuable or
more valuable than credit given cur-
rently for participation in R.O.T.C.
There will be no need to protect our-
selves from foreign invasions if we
are so fragmented as to be destroyed
internally.

 

every step...

‘W&L Is Somewhat Hypocritical
In Its Policy of Integration’

authorization or support to any
fraternity or social club whose own
policies or whose national policies
allow segregation to exist in the
local chapter.

This week-end is alumni week-end
and also will be the time for a spring
meeting of the Board of Trustees. If
WAL is to climb out of the educa-
tional and cultural hole that it has
gradually been digging itself into and
to once again become a totally en-
riching and valuable educational ex-
perience we must take steps now.
There is usually very little communi-
cation between the students and the
Board of Trustees, but perhaps that
too could begin here. The requests
are not unreasonable and in fact
only mirror the request of the class
of 1967—that W&L not allow itself
to become a small, obscure South-
ern College.

Yours truly,
s/Joseph E. Bates

 

 

To the editor:

The acquisition by McCormick Li-
brary of a painting from Cordelia
Riegel’s recent art show here is praise-
worthy. Its location in the library
is not.

Surely a significant work by a
rising contemporary artist deserves a
more prominent place than a corner
behind the door of the second floor
browsing room, a place frequented
by few students and no visitors. This
is more difficult to understand when
Miss Riegel's proximity to the Wash-
ington and Lee community is consid-
ered. She deserves more thoughtful
attention.

By REED BYRUM

Nelson A. Rockefeller, Governor
of New York and a possible presi-
dential aspirant, has been an inactive
candidate for the presidency for over
a month. Recently, the Rockefeller
Campaign Committee of WAL has
reactivated its dormant forces; Pat
Arey, Hal Clarke, and Jon Adams

rising senior from Chatham, Virginia,
has consented to explain their actions
and their background reasoning, as
well as to enlighten upon many of
the controversies of Rochefeller's
candidacy,

Ring-tum Phi: The most pertinent
question concerning your Commit-
tee ix, of course, why have you
decided to restart your campaign
activities?

Arey: The principal reason for this
action is to protect the interests of
Nelson Rockefeller, who is still very
much of a potential candidate for
the presidency. He, as Ronald Reagan,
represents a serious challenge to Rich-
ard Nixon, who has put together only
a very fragile fabric, which can be
torn easily

Secondly, Rockefeller still has
shown a definite interest in the na-
tienal convention. This is well evi-
denced by his reservation concerning
his acceptance of a draft and his

feller’s interest. We ourselves are un-
able to determine this: only Rocky
himself can establish this

The query which we pose to

R4P: Have you and your oganiza- |
tion received any national backing —
or prodding to reactive the focal |
campaign?

Arey: We have received neither money |
i

nor advice from any outside source: | runners, will conduct a mass demon-

io put on as big a show as the

| Arey: We, as those who are support: |

Reagan and Nixon committees are
now doing. We will, however, do our
best to give Rockefeller as much
notice and publicity as possible.

We have contacted several promi-
nent national figures within the past
few months, but they were not at
all helpful. Even George Hinman, who
is the Republican National Commit-
teeman of New York and a top ad-
visor for Rocky, said that he was
proud of our efforts, bul was unable
to aid us.

We will not anticipate any miracles
because of our lack of funds. We
will just have to run a low-key
campaign until the Mock Conven-
tion,

R4P: Have you planned any pre-
convention social activities?

Arey: We have scheduled a beer party
for Monday, April 29, at the New
York Delegation Headquarters at
4:00 p.m; this location is right next
to Leggett'’s. Of course, if we had
more money, we could have more
of these parties, but our lack of
funds prevents us from doing so

RiP: Have you planned any |

 

demonstrations for the convention |

itself?

ing a favorite son or one of the front-|

stration for Rockefeller. We anticipate
at least 200 to 250 delegates, plus a

 

number of straglers, to go charging
around the convention hall, beating
drums, ringing cow bells, and raising
hell. This will be typical of most
of the other candidates.

RP: Supposing that Rockefeller
loses the presidential nomination,
do you think that Rocky will try
to win the nomination for the vice-
presidency?

Arey: I'm sure that Rockefeller feels
that the job, “ain't worth a pitcher

Meet To Bridgewater

The Washington and Lee track
team seemed to have an aversion to
first place finishes Tuesday, as they
dropped a 93-52 decision to Bridge-

formances and many close finishes,
the Generals found themselves unable
to carry off their share of events.

As usual, the biggest bright spot
of the meet for W&L was Mike

honors in the high jump. Neer came

Blue with a throw of 133142”. This
proved to be the only event the
cindermen could sweep as Earl Ed-
wards and Greg Crampton took sec-
ond and third places respectively.

John Lawrence placed first in the
pole vault with a mark of 11°6”.
Cris Crossman managed a second to
give the Generals their only other one-
two combination. Other events won
were the shotput by Phil Jones and the
broad jump by Bill Kahn.

Although the Generals placed well
in the field events, they were totally
ineffective in the running ones. The
Blue failed to take a single first in
this area, Corbet Bryant, team cap-
tain, was most notable here in run-
ning the two-mile in 10:14.6. This
was his best performance of the year
and ordinarily should have been good
enough to win, yet it was three sec-
onds behind the winning time, and
only amounted to a third.

The loss to the Eagles brought the

| thinclads’ season record to 2-3. To-

morrow, the Generals face Old
Dominion on Wilson Field in what
should prove to be the most interest-
ing match-up of the year. The Mon-
archs boast a fine team and the
leading high junyper in the state. Mike
Neer of W&L has to be rated number
two and a victory over OD’s Wright
would give him a big boost toward
taking All-State honors, Neer has

est mark in Virginia this year with a
6'7-1/8" jump, but has failed to
achieve Neer’s consistency.

Eye Upset Of League Champs

 

Stickmen Set For Rugged Wash. College

By STUART PORTER

The W&L lacrosse team is out to}
upset one of the really good teams |
it has left to play when it meets |
Washington College of Chestertown, |
Md., tomorrow on Wilson Field at
3:45, following the track meet. The}
Generals hope to avenge last year’s |
14-3 trouncing by this same team, |
as well as last Saturday's 6-4 double |
overtime loss to Towson State.

The Blue’s record to date is 1-4, |
but this is not indicative of their

Towson and Notre Dame were very
close. In fact, the Generals’ offensive
unit outshot both teams, their main
problem being in hitting the goalie
and not the goal. Despite this, at-
tackman Tom Pittman has managed
to score ten goals for the team lead.
Chip Chew, also an attackman, is
the next leading scorer, with eight
tallies to his credit. Whit Morril is
leading all mid-field scorers with two
goals. Captain Charlie Stewart has the
most ground balls, having picked up

playing ability. On the contrary, the} 35

defensive unit of Harold Stowe, Bill |
Brumback, captain Charlie Stewart, |
and goalie Dave Johnson, are pre-|
pared for the expected Washington |
College onslaught.

Face League Champs

The Washington College team, per-
haps one of the best in the country,
plays such squads as John Hopkins, |
Maryland, and Syracuse. They've been
Strohbar League champs every year
since the league has been in existence,
and are known for their excellent stick
handling.

Despite W&L’s _ less-than-exciting
record, the team still has good morale,
but a big win could do wonders for |
their performance in the remaining
games. The last two games against

of victory number five, instead wound
up dropping their second match of
the season, 7-2, to William and Mary

Although the score was not indi-
cative, the Generals came close to
defeating the Southern Conference
Indians. Three of the six singles
matches went three sets, and Wash

Ken Cribb
Named Head
Of YR Club

Kenneth Cribb, a Phi Delt sopho-
more, was elected president of the
Washington and Lee Young Republi-
cans at the annual meeting of the
club Wednesday night.

Cribb, a native of Spartanburg,
S.C., was elected by acclamation,

Hank Graddy, Beta junior, from
Versailles, Ky., was elected first vice
chairman and Robert R. Weed, sopho-
more from Richmond, was elected
second vice chairman,

Other new officers are Sky Lininger,
a freshman from Tucson, Arizona,
recording secretary; Al Gibson, Sigma
Chi sophomore from Rockford, Ill.,
corresponding secretary; and Wally
Barre, Phi Delt sophomore from
Spartanburg, S.C., treasurer. Both
Lininger and Gibson were opposed.

The W&L YR’s also passed unani-
mously a resolution calling for affilia-
tion of W&L with the Virginia As-
sociation of Student Governments.
The resolution criticized the lack of
participation in statewide activities by
WAL.

A second resolution endorsed a
capital improvement bond issue for
$81 million which will be presented
to the voters of Virginia in a referen-
dum this November. The bond issue
will provide funds for school and
mental health facility construction.
Young Republicans from Mary
Baldiwn College attended the club
elections. Following the meeting, a
“happy hour” was held at the “Liquid
Lunch.”

Programs to finish the school year
were discussed following the meeting.
Republican congressional candidate
“Pete” Giesen of Staunton has been
invited to speak to the club in May.
A picnic at Goshen with the Mary
Baldwin YR’s following the Mock

R| Convention here was also suggested.

“The way

By JODY KLINE

Student Body Secretary
(Editor’s note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
faculty concerning any topic, The
opinions expressed in this column
do not necesarily represent those
of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi.)

I am quite happy to accomodate
The Ring-tum Phi and comment on
a letter that appeared in last Friday's
edition by Mr. Leslie Smith, an inter-
mediate law student.

1 found it the best expressed argu-

ment for social
change (in any
area) that The

Ring-tum Phi has
featured this year.
Framing his points

in the’ reference
field of  integra-
tion and Negro

problems, Mr.
Smith presented a
cogent argument
for increased social
awareness on this
campus. Although I found many of
his interesting points valid, unfortun-
ately 1 discovered some that I feel
I must take issue with.

1 disagree with Mr. Smith that
this is a center of Southern pro-
vincialism. This writer is from the
North and feels that Washington and
Lee has to its credit a wide geographic
distribution within its student body.
With a cosmopolitan group come
varied backgrounds and ideas, The
South may provide us with our tradi-
tions, but I don't believe that it
marshalls our thinking.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

= The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi 2

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, April 30, 1968

Transition

Beginning with this issue, the Tuesday Edi-
tion’s Editor-in-Chief-Elect, Larry Honig, as-
sumes the directorship of this newspaper.
Several changes he has decided upon are be-
ing implemented in today’s Ring-tum Phi (viz
“The way I see it’).

Although the 1967-1968 Editor-in-Chief
retains full responsibility for his paper
through Commencement Day, it is in keep-
ing with long-standing tradition that the pro-
prietorship be turned over to his successor as
soon as the Publications Board elects one. We
are very, very happy to be able to “retire’’
and yet know that this newspaper could be in
no more capable hands than Mr. Honig’s. For
the information of our readership, the 1967-
1968 Editor intends to make occasional—
probably continual—use, for the rest of this
year, of the editorial column, on a “sharing”
basis with the Editor-Elect. (The latter, inci-
dentally, has chosen to distinguish his edi-
torials from ours by the use of his initials.)
Other than that, the Tuesday Edition is
securely his, from this day on.

LN

The road to hell
could be paved with
VASG’s good intentions

The Executive Committee last evening passed
a resolution affiliating Washington and Lee
with the Virginia Association of Student Gov-
ernments. This same EC rightly rejected such
membership December 4, by a seven-to-one
vote—but saw fit to reverse itself now after
being assured by Tas Schulz, the president of
the VASG, that while there is not a single
limitation on the VASG’s powers in_ its
constitution, everything will probably be all
right anyway because the group means well.

b | hg
Could it be?

Last week’s letter on the bulletin boards,
signed by five members of the EC, wasn’t
intended this way—but it struck us neverthe-
less as approaching a streamlined, one-party
version of the old, dead (or domant?) two-
party Clique system.

Lg

A non-rhetorical reply

“Who but a Troub,” the Friday Editor asks,
“really knows what he’s talking about when
he repeats that the theatre is inadequate?”
Just for the record, we should be glad to tell
(1) who, and (2) how they can do it.

Firstly: there is an astonishingly large
number of non-Troub people who really do
know—precisely and with certainty—just
what they are talking about when they speak
of the “theatre’s” inadequacy. Secondly: these
people can, and do, arrive at that value judg-
ment (and others like it) through normal
processes of thoughtful observation, followed
by thoughtful articulation. It is really quite
simple, and most people do it quite well, quite
often and quite legitimately. Here are two
basic stipulations: all one has to do is recognize
that pure armchair philosophizing upon a
purely abstract “aridity / thoughtfulness” con-
tinuum fails to encompass the whole story; and
that, similarly, not even caring to try to de-
velop one’s capacity for perception beyond
a petty, purely semantic “cliche /non-cliche”
frame of reference has equally little perti-
nence.

We are not, even for a moment, trying
to twist the words of the Friday Editor and
charge him with claiming the Troub Theatre
is adequate. We don’t suppose at all that it
was his intent to contradict the substance of
this Edition’s three or four editorials about
the theatre-building (and “inadequate” is a
far-too-inadequate word with which to sum
up our attitude cowards that disgusting anti-
thesis of what a theatre-building should be).
And we realize, and agree with, the context
in which the Troub statement was made. What
we are commenting upon is only this un-

fortunate choice of an exempli gratia. Our
purpose now is simply to ask this: before
seizing upon how we say something, listen to
what it is we’re saying.

2

P.S.: And anyhow, the Tuesday Editor spent
two years working backstage at the “theatre”
as a member of the Troubs.

Lng

Miscellaneous observations

It has come to our attention, and has brought
with it a great deal of mirth, that our good
neighbor to the north—Virginia Military—
found grievous fault with the latest number
of the Southern Collegian. Some unimagi-
native barracks martinet even went around to
everybody requiring them to hand in the Col-
legians, for which appropriate recompense was
of course made. And all because of the article
by an anonymous “former rat” about certain
practices of the Institute regarding its fresh-

men.
2>

We've discussed, from time to time this year,
the nature of some of the junk mail we re-
ceive. Well, last week was enough to astound
even the most stouthearted. Vista, which usu-
ally limits itself to about six or eight manila
envelopes full every week, went all the way
and sent us two 40-pound packing crates of
“Vista Voice” newsletters. All of them under
the frank, of course. (But then, as Professor
Dickens pointed out earlier this year, what’s
the difference if we pay for a frank or if we
pay for a thousand little slips of perforated
paper for them to use on this unsolicited

trash?)
Ye
Capable of honor

The avant-garde thing to say these days is
that Washington and Lee’s integration is
“token,” but those who bemoan the situation
have cleverly neglected to supply a definition.
If token simply deals with numbers, then yes,
we have token integration. But if token implies
a state of mind, the silent pursuit of a self.
congratulatory mean of hypocrisy as far as
admissions are concerned, then no, we have
much more than token integration. There is a
shade of difference here which in years to
come will test our mettle far more conscienti-
ously than have the policy decisions of the
Office of Admissions.

For two years, applicants have not been
asked to give either a picture or their religion,
and as has always been the case, requests for
financial aid are considered separately from
applications for admission. Any student who is
admitted and has a genuine need for funds
will be given whatever amount is necessary
for him to matriculate. This University is
represented at all college nights for which
there is time, including those high schools
where the majority of students are Negro.
Since 1965, Washington and Lee has been
actively recruiting applicants from the Up-
ward Bound Program, which offers two
summer sessions of college study to high
school students living in economically or cul-
turally deprived areas. W&L is truly avail-
able to all high school students of sufficient
intelligence.

If, then, our integration is token, the fault
lies outside the realm of recruitment, admis-
sion, and finance. The Office of Admissions
"an assure a prospective applicant—and rightly
so we think—that awkward, hostile, or patro-
nizing situations on the Hill will be almost non-
existant. But when classes are over, the situa-
tion changes and exclusion may become a
fact. If this is the case, can Dean Farrar
honestly say to all applicants that Washington
and Lee will allow them to be everywhere
assimilated? He sincerely, and quite optimisti-
cally, believes we are in a position to so
promise -which is the basis for our open
policy on admissions.

The ultimate decision on integration is
the students’ to make, in each facet of student
life: campus organizations, positions of re-
sponsibility, social situations, and fraternity

membership. The University will await our|

response.

 

Republicans may have better chance
for victory with Nelson Rockefeller

By KIRK REID MANNING

The Republican Party must present-
ly be concerned with the overriding
issue of winning in November. How-
ever if it is to win, it must select
the ticket which will have the best
chance of success.

Richard Nixon is the front runner
for the nomination and is the favorite
in the polls, But, is this the man that
will win in November? Before decid-
ing we should consider several facts,

(1) Nixon has not won an elective
office by himself for 18 years and
is a potential no-win candidate once
again in November.

(2) Nixon’s ability to perform as
a capable executive is unproven

 

In the past 16 years he has had
limited authority and his role as a
decision maker has been severely re-
stricted.

(3) Nixon has been known at times
to become angry and frustrated when
he is provoked. This happened in his
1962 gubernatorial race. If this re-
occurs, it might result in the aliena-
tion of many of Nixon's supporters
and would-be admirers.

After considering these facts, the
answer to the question of Nixon’s
ability to win in November is aca-
demic, The question now is whether
or not the Republican Party can
afford to put its hopes and resources
behind a man who is a no-win candi-
date by definition and who could con-

 

 

EDMUND D. CAMPBELL, distinguished graduate in the class of 1918,

reminisces about post-war years.

Former editor and EC member

Alumnus recalls days at W&L

By ROBERT YEVICH

Student life at W&L has not chang-
ed as much as one might think over
the years. Last weekend Edmund D.
Campbell, returning for the fiftieth
reunion of the class of 1918, remi-
nisced about some of the memories
of his life at W&L.

The Lyric Theatre at that time had
the bad habit of showing second rate
flicks at double the normal price.
Under Campbell's guidance The Ring-
tum Phi sponsored and organized a
strike against the Lyric. After a few
days of successful student boycotting
Issac Wineburg, proprietor of © the
Lyric, capitulated and rescinded his
price increases. He also agreed to
show more Grade A movies.

Since the United States was at war
in 1918, many students volunteered
for the Student Army Training Corps.
The corps drilled every day on the
front lawn of the campus. But, ac-
cording to Campbell, the corps was
“trained with much chagrin by VMI
first classmen.” This chagrin was
probably aggravated by another inci-
dent which occured during Campbell's
career here. This has come to be
known as the Great Squeedunk Inci-
dent.

Painted Columns

Campbell told how surprised he
was to come to class one morning
about 8:45 and see the VMI colors
painted on the columns of Wash-
ington Hall, Being a member of the
executive committee, he went with
the EC to the VMI superintendent
who denied that any cadets took part
in the crime, But Campbell recalls
that far too many cadets were sus-
piciously looking out of their bar-
racks windows when the EC arrived
that morning. Suspicions at WAL were
even more aroused since someone had
pushed VMI “sacred cannon” down
a ravine only a few days before.

Campbell received another surprise
one other morning when he noticed
a buggy perched atop George Wash-
ington’s statue when he arrived for
morning classes. He said no one ever

did figure out who put the buggy up
there or how they got it there

The Ring-tum Phi only came out
once a week then, on Tuesday. It

was printed at the Rockbridge County
News print shop and the staff had
to sit beside the old linotypist and
proofread as he worked. Often the
paper lacked enough pictures since
the cuts had to be sent by mail to
Lynchburg

Campbell, a Washington lawyer,
comes from a family long associated
with WAL. He was born on campus
in Dr, Johnson's house since his

father, Henry D. Campbell, was Dean
of the College. His grandfather, pro-
fessor John L. Campbell, lived next
door to General Lee in what is now
Dr. Sensabaugh’s resktence

Campbell has in his possesion a
to his grandfather
The letter is & note

letter from Lee

n Hot Springs

«L.H. | of thanks from Lee for taking care

 

of his sick cow there. Campbell also
has a letter written to his grandfather
by Stonewall Jackson. Jackson, a VMI
professor, was teaching Sunday school
for colored slave children at the Pres-
byterian church. The letter asks Mr.
Campbell to teach one Sunday since
he had to go out of town.

ceivably lose the election by one emo-
tional angry outburst.

Governor Nelson Rockefeller is an
undeclared candidate for the nomina-
tion, Is he the man with the best
chance of success? The answer is not
pessimistic, Why?

(1) Rockefeller has a strong appeal
to not only the Republican voters but
also the large segment of indepenent
voters. His moderate-liberal philo-
sophy is well regarded by the general
electorate.

(2) Rockefeller has proved himself
to be an excellent administrator and
a decisive executive. Rockefeller’s
leadership has been instrumental in
making New York one of the most
progressive states in the Union. He
has championed legislation for educa-
tion, medical care, low income hous-
ing, law enforcement, job opportuni-
ties, highways, control of pollution
and mental health. He is nationally
known for his determined efforts in
securing the most extensive civil rights
and equal opportunity legislation in
the nation. It is significant that this
legislation has been while the state
debt has been reduced in each suc-
cessive year of the Rockefeller ad-
ministration.

(3) Rockefeller has been active in
State and local government for 34
years. His experience is evidenced by
his service to President Roosevelt,
Truman and Eisenhower. His duties
have included such distinguished posts
as Asst. Secretary of State, chairman
of the AID Advisory Committee,
chairman of the President's Advisory
Committee, Under Secretary of HEW
and Special Asst. to the President for
foreign Affairs.

Most voters have considered these
and other factors. We have pondered
the merits and disadvantages of many
candidates. I wish along with other
Republicans a winning ticket. My
choice is not conclusive, but, I think
that we would be foolish not to con-
sider the superb qualities of Nelson
Rockefeller. He is the one cadndidate
who is able to unite the Republican
Party and influence the independent
vote. Our hopes and expectations can
only be brought to bear upon our
nation with the nomination and elect-
ion of Governor Nelson Rockefeller,
The Presidency is ours and our partici-
pation is paramount.

I ndependent poll

(Editor's note: a poll was taken,
not by The Ring-tum Phi, in early
January of this year to discern
opinion concerning the newspaper's
non-editorial policies. Following are
some of the results.)

The “Independent Poll” was a sur-
vey of the entire faculty and ad-
ministration, 149 people, and approxi-
mately one-fifth of the student body,
260 people. 48 per cent of the faculty
returned the questionnaire, while stu-
dent participation was 65 per cent.

On the question, “How well do you
read The Ring-tum Phi?” $3 per cent
of the faculty answered “Read most
stories and the editorials,” to which
the students’ answer was 67 per cent.

“In which items are you most in-
terested?” (By percentages.)

The most heartening answer, from

The Ring-tum Phi —Tuesday

The Ring-tum Phi is
year. It is printed by the

 

the staff's point of view, was to the
question “Are you satisfied with The
Ring-tum Phi, generally speaking,
aside from its editorial policy?” (By
percentages.)

Faculty

64 Yes 28 No 8 na.
Students

71 Yes 28 No I na.

There were several additional ques-
tions, but since most are of peripheral
interest only a selected few are in-
cluded here. 86 per cent of the faculty
and 85 per cent of the students said
“yes” to covering and reporting
speeches or programs given by per-
sons invited to the campus after they
have taken place.

71 per cent of the students wanted
The Ring-tum Phi to publish a brief
weather report. The result of this
answer is that the Tuesday edition
will follow the Friday edition’s lead
in doing this. So is the case with the
University calendar, when there is
space, since 83 per cent of the faculty
wanted it, and 91 per cent of the
students preferred including it.

Anyone who would like to see a
very extensive breakdown of the re-
sponses to this poll or additional
results of the survey are invited to

Stickmen fall to Washington Col.

Last Saturday, in the rain and
cold, a small crowd watched the Gen-
erals’ Lacrosse team lose to Wash-
ington College. The Generals played
well but the stickmen from Wash-
ington proved to be their betters as
they won 14 to 8. This was the Gen-
erals’ fourth straight loss,

Washington College had two ex-
cellent attackmen which the Generals
had to stop if they hoped to win but
unfortunately the defense couldn’t

hold them as Reagen scored four
goals as did Madden. The offense
played very well, amassing their high-
est point total of the year. Chew
scored 3 goals, Pittman 2, Wich 1,
Carter 1, and Schenkel 1. The Gen-
erals were without the service of mid-
fielder and face-off man Jay Meri-
weather but Terry Griffin and Bob
Frost did an excelent job of filling in.

The difference might have been that
Washington capitalized on our mis-
takes as we failed to do on theirs.
Washington was well disciplined and
executed their offense and defense
with precision. The Generals didn’t
quit however, and kept battling, even
in the last few minutes when defeat
was certain.

The Generals meet Roanoke Col-
lege here this Thursday in what should
be a good contest. On the dark side
is that goalie Dave Johnson has a
journalism lab in Roanoke on Thurs-
day afternoon and may not be able
to participate. The rest of the season
includes Duke and our rivals from
Charlottesville, U.Va. Both teams are
good and the Generals will be look-
ing for all-out efforts from the squad
to try and salvage the season, Coach
Szlasa is optimistic about both the
remainder of this season and next
year as well. He cited Whit Morril

Glovemen end loss streak

 

The Generals finally snapped their
recent losing streak with a 9 to 6
win over R.P.I. last Friday afternoon. |
The day before dropped a pair of |
close ones to Old Dominion 3 to 0
and 3 to 1. The star of the R.P.1.
game was rightfielder, Charlie Freret |
who drove in five runs. The winning |
pitcher was Thom Mitchel who went!
the whole route.

Against ODC the Generals were |
winning one to nothing on a home
run by Jim Wilson when an error
allowed the winning runs to come
across the plate. In the second
the Generals couldn't seem to find)
the range at the plate. The losing |
pitchers were Bill Rasmussen and
John Botcheller.

The Generals journey to Bridge- |
water this afternoon in hopes of |
getting even for the trouncing they
took last time out against the Eagles. |

Rain dampens Classic

Neither rain nor hail nor freezing
cold nor Bud could deter the eighteen
intrepid tubers who sailed forth on
the Maury River Saturday in quest of
victory in the running of the Second
Anuual Goshen Classic.

In a chilly downpour and a river
running above expected depth and
below expected temperature, ingenuity
was the key word for all contestants.
Some donned life jackets, others crash
helmets, and still others, scuba-type
wetsuits. The spectators on the banks
thought they all should have donned
straight jackets, for, as one was quoted
as saying, “You gotta be crazy to
get in that river today.”

But it appears that the lure of a
College Town Shop-donated After
Six white dinner jacket was too much
to sway the contestants from the Call
of the Wet. And the Call was the
loudest for senior law student Wins-
ton Mathews, who, strapped in his
inner tube and wearing a full length
wetsuit, bright orange chest protector,
and crash helmet, chopped 36 seconds
off last years’ record pace and upset
defending champion Jim Batterson—
who, in the true Polar Bear Club
tradition, was clad in next to nothing.

Mathews’ time of 32:00 was phe-
nomenal, but even more astounding
was the way he negotiated the swift
Maury rapids. With his inner tube
strapped around his waist, he swam
through the pools and spun through
the rapids with his tube on edge,
like an inflatable wheel of fortune.
The technique did the trick, though,
as he defated defending champ Bat-
terson, who used the more conven-
tional tubing approach, by twenty-
three seconds.

Batterson did not go home empty
handed, though, as he and fellow
Gaines Society member Scott Tred-
well took the team title and the keg
of beer that went with it, defeating
the ZBT duo of Scot Brower and
Mark Horne by 3:06.

Of the eighteen tubers who started
the race, sixteen managed to float
across the finish line of the two-mile
course. The only two casualties were
Ken George, Sigma Nu sophomore,
who suffered leg cramps and dropped
out of the race; and SPE sophomore

Ed Suplee, whose tube exploded
within sight of the finish.
Although Classic Director Jerry

Perlman, in view of Saturday's miser-
able weather, termed the event a
“qualified success,” he did express
disappointment in the fact that he
had no contestants for either the
Powerpuff (girls) or the President's
Trophy Race (faculty and staff). The
latter was expected to be a battle
between Information Services Di-
rector John Hughes and Sports In-
formation Director Mickey Philipps,
but both dropped out of the race
when the rain caused their “rheuma-
tism” to act up.

Perlman, when asked if he planned
to hold the Classic again next year,
said, “If the weatherman will give
us a break, there will definitely be a
Third Annual affair, But after this
year, | wouldn't be surprised if the
polar icecap descends on Rockbridge
County next year at this time.”

of the contested offices. The four
top EC candidates and the two top
candidates for the president and vice-
president will be in the Monday final
election. In this election each voter
will have two ballots for the EC, and
one each for the president and vice-

| president,

The freshman ballot box will be
in the quad, while the sophomore and
junior ballot boxes will be by Wash-
ington Hall. The polls will be open
from 8:25 a.m. until 2 p.m, The EC
decided that there would be no
speeches before the balloting. The
consensus of the EC was that these
were so poorly attended that they
were more of an encumbrance instead
of a help. This was also done with
the hope of increasing the voter
participation.

Curriculum report

In further action the EC listened
to a report from Swede Henberg, the
new chairman of the Curriculum
Committee. Henberg noted the close
cooperation that was developing be-
tween the faculty and the student
committees. He also stated that the
committee was investigating the pres-
ent system of faculty advisors and a
clarification of the independent ma-
jor.

The EC voted $40 to Jody Kline
and Steve Saunders to reimburse them
for their recent participation in the
Hollins Mock Security Council. This
is the third year that the EC has
supported a delegation.

Junior representative, Lee Halford,
reported on his work as head of a
subcommittee investigating the pro-
gress of the Self Study Report. He
said that most of the problems ulti-
mately stem from a lack of adequate
financial resources. With the advent
of the Office for University Develop-
ment and a new president this ob-
stacle should be soon overcome.

in an advisory capacity for the Pan-
American Petroleum Corporation.

Structural geology is Dr. Dunn's
major field of interest. Currently, he
is studying the structure and develop-
ment of folded mountain belts. His
primary area of study has been the
Piedmont and Appalachian region of
Virginia and North Carolina.

Although Dr. Dunn's lectures will
be technical and scientific in nature,
Dr. Edgar W. Spencer, head of the
Geology Department, has stated that
“anyone who is interested may at-
tend.”

W&L debaters

trophy winners

Washington and Lee debaters end-
ed up the tournament debate sched-
ule over the week-end at NYU by
winning 8 of 12 debates, placing
speakers in 4th and Sth spots, and
winning an Extemp trophy.

Kevin Baker and Andrew Wynd-
ham, W&L’s top freshman debaters,
won four of six debates. Baker tied
for 4th speaker spot and Wyndham
same in 5th out of a field of 160
debaters representing 25 states and
60 colleges. As a team, Wyndham
and Baker were in 11th place out of
80 teams. The NYU Tournament
was not a novice or freshmen meet.

Jim Hamill, debating for he first
time in 18 months, with Worth Black-
well also won 4 of 6 debates; Hamill
and Blackwell as a team were in
16th place. Further, Hamill placed
3rd in the Extemp contest and wen
a trophy.

In all, this year between 25-30
WAL debaters have participated in
22 tournaments, winning out-right four
of them and receiving 34 trophies
and certificates in this the most suc-
cessful debate season ever at Wash-
ington and Lee.

three judge district court and later
in the Fourth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals in Richmond.

and others for remaining silent on
further integration at W&L. I did so
not because I felt that it was im-
portant but because | believe that
to a large extent the issue had been
resolved. Personally, | have always
been impressed with the way Negroes
were assimilated into the Washington
and Lee routine. This I believe can
be credited partly to the fact that
Mr. Smith, himself a Negro, is not
: “black-clause buster” sponsored by
a Negro group but rather has a sin-
cere interest in getting a fine legal
education, But the student body can
be congratulated for, in some cases,
placing personal feelings behind what
the majority felt was right for Wash-
ington and Lee.

I am glad that further integration
is coming to WAL. But I feel that
it should come at a natural rate. With
personal pictures removed from the
application forms, discrimination now
would be difficult, therefore 1 believe
that the University undeniably stands
ready to accept any qualified Negro
But | do not feel that the Office
of Admissions should Bo out and

 

recruit a Negro simply to say that
we have them here. Mr. Smith must
agree with me that integration is not
determined by the numbers of Negroes
at WAL but by the degree to which
they are accepted in the daily routines
of this campus. Realistically, 1 must
agree with Mr. Smith that this has
not occurred totally yet. Nor will it
until a fundamental relationship is
established.

This campus will best accept the
Negro when they know him—when
they play sports with him, work with
him or study with him. This campus
will best understand the Negroes’
problems when they may talk with
one. Mr, Smith has waited almost
two years to speak. I feel that some
expression was due from him before
now.

Admiralty Law
To Be Subject
Of Greer Talk

By DOWNS LITTLE

Mr. Frank Greer, presently affili-
ated with the law firm of Williams,
Worrell, Kelley and Worthington of
Norfolk, will be the guest lecturer in
“Admiralty Law” of the W&L School
of Law and the Student Bar Associa-
tion in the third-floor east room of
Tucker Hall, Tuesday, May 7 at
4:00 p.m.

A native of Newport, Tennessee,
Mr. Greer pursued his undergraduate
studies at Georgetown University and
his legal education at the W&L
School of Law where he was a
member of Phi Delta Phi law fra-
ternity. Following his graduation in
1951, Mr. Greer entered the Norfolk
law firm.

Among Mr. Greer's various activi-
ties are memberships in the Norfolk
and Portsmouth, Virginia State and
American Bar Associations; Virginia
Board of Bar Examiners (1963-—);
International Association of Insur-
ance Counsel,

Actually the full title of his lecture
is “Law of Admiralty and Maritime
Jurisdiction.” Essentially Admiralty
Law cases encompass personal injury
cases involving merchant seamen and
longshoremen as well as collisions
between vessels. Recently, these cases
have become increasingly complex,

Republican Representative William
E. Brock III from Tennessee, a Wash-
ington and Lee alumnus, headed the
parade as marshal. There were ap-
proximately 30 floats from the various
states in the parade, as well as the
elephants, symbols of the GOP.

A number of state beauty queens
graced the state delegation flats. They
include a former Miss South Carolina,
Miss Nancy Moore of Aiken, the 1965
titlist; Miss Texas, Miss Molly Grubb
of Tyler, and the first alternate Miss
Pennsylvania 1967, Miss Kathy Ann
Reeder.

Featured attractions included a
1919 Duesenburg and a 1928 Isetto
Fascheni. The cars, both collectors
items formally featured at the Natural
Bridge Museum, were used to trans-
port the various dignitaries.

The reviewing stand was located
on the lawn of President Huntley's
house.

 

 

History Marked by Off-beat Moments

Hot Tempers Decided Past Conventions

From its beginning 60 years ago,
the Washington and Lee Mock Con-
vention has had its share of off-beat
moments.

The first Convention in 1908, be-
gun as a class project under the
inspiration of political science Prof.
W. Jett Lauck, erupted into near
chaos. A fight broke out in the
Kansas delegation, and elsewhere
things became so heated several
delegates offered to retire outside to
settle their differences.

The National Democratic Party,
convening later in Denver, confirmed
the WAL choice of William Jennings
Bryan, the first of nine successes in
13 attempts.

A student who preferred tennis to
politics had a profound effect on the
1936 outcome, when the students
erred and picked Arthur Vanden-
burg for the Republicans.

After early balloting produced
only deadlocks, a shift began among
the larger delegations toward Vanden-
burg. Pennsylvania delegates twice
were polled and had their vote count
reversed until—according to a con-
temporary account—“an errant dele-
gate (was) brought in from the tennis
courts and voted for Vandenburg.”

Vandenburg won the nomination on
that ballot by only seven votes.

In 1940, the New York delegation
bolted the Convention because, they

said, their chairman was actually from
South Carolina. Pennsylvania also
walked out in sympathy, but all were
persuaded to return when the chair-
man sent a telegram stating he had
an apartment on Fifth Avenue and
“spent the majority of his time there.”

A shortage of adding machines
changed the 1960 outcome. Unoffici-
ally, Adlai Stevenson was well over
the necessary majority on the fourth
ballot, but the lack of adding ma-
chines caused a delay in announcing
the official total.

Work Began Four Years Ago

By CHIP HARRIS

Fhe coming weekend will transpire
for the great majority of the Wash-
ington and Lee community as a
pleasant interruption—both different
and interesting, but for a few, it will
also mark the culmination of months,
and, in a few cases, years, of effort
and time spent to insure the week-
end will merit the national acclaim
bestowed upon it.

Planning for the 1968 Mock Con-
vention was initiated in October of
1964, when the Interim Coordinating
Committee was established under the
direction of H. Davis Mayfield and
Steve Saunders, whose terms expired
the following year. In 1965, Mayfield
was appoinied sole chairman of the
Interim Committee until his with-
drawal from the University one month
later. To fill the vacaney created by
Mayfield’s departure, Steve Saunders
was again appointed chairman of the
Commitiee, a position he was
appointed to until May of 1967, when
he was made permanant chairman.

The Interim Commitiee was orga-
nized into regional managers who
presided over districts which coincid-
ed with the districts served by the
Executive Commitieemen of the Re-
publican National Committee. The
imterim bedy maintained ties with
Republican leaders and followed the
various issues confronting the party

In 1964, the leader of the Scranton
forces was downcast after students
picked Barry Goldwater over his
candidate. “What happened here isn't
going to happen in San Francisco,”
he told a Washington, D.C. reporter.
He was wrong.

The greatest guess, of course, came
in 1924, when the students solved
the marathon deadlock between Smith
and William G. McAdoo by compro-
mising on alumnus John W. Davis
on the 23rd ballot. The real con-
vention in New York hit the same

while the ballot box for freshmen
will be placed in the quad.

A primary Wednesday narrowed
down the field of candidates for the
offices of senior president and science
school vice-president and sophomore
vice-president and EC representatives.
The four top EC candidates and two
leading presidential and vice-presi-
dential candidates will be on Mon-
day's ballot.

In the senior class presidental pri-
mary, Worth Blackwell and Bucky
Cunningham beat Bob Matthews,
Jerry Perlman, and Garland Tucker.
Blackwell led the slate with 60 votes,
with Cunningham only one vote be-
hind. Jay Thiemeyer with 17 votes
and Steve Larson with 12 beat Tom
Blanton in the race for vice-president
of the science school. The final tally
showed that 139 votes were cast in
this contest,

Other candidates for senior class
offices are Rob Bauer, Bill Brown,
Jeb Brown, and Herb Crenshaw for
EC; Mark Eaker for vice-president of
the Commerce School; and Luke
Coleman for vice-president of the
School of Liberal Arts.

Can Rocky Stop Nixon?

The Washington and Lee Republican Mock Convention,
which gets under way today, suddenly gained in importance
Tuesday when New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller

officially entered the race for his party’s nomination for Pres-

ident of the United States.

It is unfortunate he has entered the race so late. Right
now it appears that the bandwagon for former Vice-President
Richard M. Nixon has rolled to just short of the necessary
number of delegate votes needed to nominate him for Presi-
dent. However, it should be realized that a victory for Rocke-
feller at our Mock Convention, which will be followed care-
fully by the national press and by the party leaders, as well
as by the candidates themselves, will provide him with an un-
paralled boost and put him back into the race.

Whether Rockefeller can win the nomination or not re-
mains to be seen. What is certain, however, is that our Mock
Convention has again been thrust into the limelight and will
be used as an indicator to determine whether Nixon can be
stopped short of the nomination in August.

Open Housing In Lexington

Everyone seems to have become much more racially con-
scious after the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. How
is this consciousness affecting the girl’s schools neighboring

Washington and Lee?

We notice that Sweet Briar took a poll of approved hous-
ing concerns in Lexington to determine how many of the
hostesses would keep Negro girls in their homes. The results
showed that there are only three hostesses available for Negro
students here. In addition, when two hostesses on the regular
approved list were asked if they would take a Negro student,
the first said she did not think her husband would let her, and
the second said she was afraid the white girls would object.

The latter comment seems to be holding up less and less.
As of April 23, 472 Sweet Briar students had signed a petition
in which they expressed a desire to remedy the above situation.
Hollins and Randolph-Macon Woman’s College have also
threatened to boycott any home in Lexington which will not
allow Negro students to stay there. What should be formulated
is one approved housing list for each of the schools for all

girls, regardless of their race.

This may seem far removed from some of us now, but as
Washington and Lee and our neighbors accept more Negro
students (at least five were accepted here this year) this may
become a real problem. Maybe it can be nipped in the bud.

RICHARD M. NIXON

Nixon: Strategy Changed;
Victory Still Is Expected

By CHIP DAY

Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s re-
cent re-entry into the Republican
race for the Presidential nomination
will alter the Nixon campaign staft’s
Convention strategy. Prior to Mr.
Rockefeller’s announcement Tuesday,
our only problem was how to have
Mr. Nixon nominated on the first
ballot. Now that Michigan has an-
nounced George Romney as its fav-
orite son and Rockefeller is now back
in the race, a first ballot victory for
Nixon is virtually impossible. That
is the only hurdle, however, that the
New York Governor has placed in
Nixon's path.

While Rocky was still in the race
during early March, Nixon had enough
votes, disregarding favorite sons, to
win on the first ballot. Some of these
votes shifted from Rocky to Nixon
in February because of the former's
reluctance to take a stand. Surely,
the Rockefeller camp cannot now ex-
pect these erstwhile Rocky delegates
to come stampeding back to the
Rockefeller cause. Politicians do not
favor in-again-out-again candidates,
and the Governor will surely suffer
because of his political “minuet.”

Nixon On First Ballot?

Why cannot Richard Nixon gain a
first ballot victory? There is a plethora
of favorite son candidates in line for
nomination in tomorrow's balloting
session. Some of them will be legiti-

| mate nominations; others will be ques-

tionable. If Claude Kirk were not

 

Campaign Promotes ‘Creative Society’

Reagan: Let A Winner Lead The Way

By CRAIG DESBOROUGH

The Reagan for President Commit-
tee has set as the theme of its cam-
paign: “Let a Winner Lead the Way.”
This theme denotes the winning cap-
ability of Governor Reagan as dem-
onstrated in his gubernatorial race in
California doing what two nationally
prominant Republican candidates
could not do: win over former gov-
ernor Pat Brown and by a one
million vote plurality, further dem-
onstrating his ability to win Democrat
and independent voters, as well as
keeping a united Republican Party
behind him.

The Reagan campaign is promot-
ing the concept of a “Creative So-
ciety” as opposed to the Great Society
welfarism as the solutions to the prob-
lems which face America today, The
Creative Society places emphasis on
the roles of the independent sector,
private enterprise and state and local
governments in solving the problems
which confront our society.

The Reagan campaign is placing

 

 

special emphasis on Governor Rea-
gan’s strong stand in favor of law and
order and against crime and civil
disobedience. His promotion of local
law enforcement agencies, plus his
application of the Creative Society
concept (getting private enterprise to
provide job training and jobs for the
unemployed; thus, getting jobs for
17,500 of the 25,000 unemployed
under the Brown administration in
the Watts area alone, at no cost to
the taxpayer) kept California calm
and peaceful, unlike the rest of the
nation which erupted in civil turmoil
at the death of Martin Luther King.

The Reagan campaign feels of
special interest to students and all
young people in Governor Reagan's
stand against the compulsory draft.
Governor Reagan has stated: “I have
often wondered why we couldn't, with
the brainpower and know-how we
have in this country, evolve a pro-
gram of inducement to enlistment,
incentives to enlist, to see if we could
not switch to the voluntary system.”

The Reagan for President Comit-
tee is making a special effort to get
Governor Reagan's overwhelming
record of executive and administrative
experience prior to his becoming Gov-
ernor of California before the con-
vention delegates. Ronald Reagan
served as president of the (15,000-
member-strong AFL-CIO Union)
Screen Actor's Guild for six terms and
a member of its Board of Directors
for 14 years. Further, he served as
President of the Motion Picture In-
dustry Council for two term sand
a member of its Board of Directors
for 10 years

The Reagan for President Commit
tee hopes Governor Reagan will an
nounce his candidacy for the Presi
dency officially in the near future, It
respects the professional polls which
show him with over 350 first-ballot
votes with his declared candidacy.
In the WAL Mock convention, the
Reagan committee expects sirong and
solid first ballot support from West-
ern states and Southern States, as well

the keynote speaker and the Governor
of Florida, he most likely would
not be nominated as a favorite son
in either Lexington or Miami; not-
withstanding his colorful political
ambitions as a leader of the Re-
publican party. It is also questionable
whether Governor Love of Colorado
will receive a speech in Miami.

And it is curious that the Hawaii
delegation will nominate Senator
Hiram Fong of that state as they
have not received a single response
to inquiries on how to distribute their
votes. Of course several of the fav-
orite son nominations will have some
foundation. Maryland’s Spiro Agnew
will be thrown in, as will George
Romney, in an attempt to stall Mr.
Nixon on the first ballot and thus
give Rockefeller (both Agnew and
Romney are Rocky fans) at least a
sporting chance. Conversely, however,
at least two states may sacrifice a
favorite son nomination and cast their
Nixon votes on the first ballot in
order to receive the vice-presidential
nod from Nixon. Notably among
these are Illinois (Percy) and Massa-
chusetts (Volpe).

Strategy Secret

The Nixon campaign strategy has
been altered slightly in view of Rocke-
feller’s big-step-forward earlier this
week. As Nixon supporters, we are
heartily pleased that Mr. Nixon finally
has an opponent whom he can utilize
to destroy his press-created loser’s
image.

As to our strategy—we realistically
prefer to keep that confidential until
the Saturday morning session on the
Convention floor. One aspect of our
plan that we have already revealed
is our intention of having the noisiest,
most exuberant, and colorful post-
nomination speech demonstration the
WAL Mock Convention has ever
seen. We heartily encourage all Nixon
supporters to participate and have an
enjoyable time in the process.

On behalf of the Nixon campaign
staff, | want to thank all W&L stu-
dents who came to the Nixon beer
rallies and made them so successful.
Our only hope is that your pre-
convention enthusiasm will spill over
tomorrow on the Convention floor
when Richard N. Nixon is nominated
to be the next President of the United
States.

Favorite Sons

Nominating speeches will be given
at the Mock Convention for the fol-
lowing favorite sons: Walter J, Hickal,
Governor of Alaska: John Tower,
Senator from Texas; Raymond Shafer,
Governor of Pennsylvania; Frank
Carlson, Favorite Son of Kansas;
Strom Thurmond, Senator from South
Carolina; and John Love, Governor
of Colorado

For Victory Examined

Rockefeller: Will Give Party

Victories For Years To Come

By PAT AREY

Imagine if you can the climate
that will prevail in the nation this
summer by Convention time. We are
promised a summer of violence and
lawlessness; a period when only men
who hold responsibility and power
will be able to affect the course of
events. The American people will get
a chance to see how effectively and
intelligently that power has been ex-
ercised. Nelson Rockefeller will have
been put to the most extreme test that
any Governor can face. Dick Nixon
will be able only to comment as a
man without responsibility.

Americans have historically judged
a man on his accomplishments, and
not on his promises. Rockefeller has
accomplished, as governor of the sec-
ond largest state, more than any
other man in a governor's office.
Great advances in health, education,
welfare, civil rights, urban develop-
ment, transportation, and the nation’s
most sophisticated program of pollu-
tion control, have made New York
a leader among the states. And yet
massive as these programs have been,
and as astounding as the attained re-
sults are, not once has the budget
been out of balance. Industry is once
again coming into New York. Fiscal
responsibility has been the by-word
in Albany.

Rocky’s Record
Couple his record as governor with
his record as an advisor to three

Presidents (Chairman of Inter-Ameri-
can Development Commission, As-
sistant Secretary of State for Ameri-
can Republics Affairs, Chairman of
International Development Advisory
Board, one of the key organizors of
the United Nations in 1945, Special
Assistant to the President on Foreign

 

Affairs, Under-Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare, Consultant
to the Secretary of Defense during the
organization of that department,
Chairman of Eisenhower's Advisory
Committee on Government Organiza-
tion, and many more) and you under-
stand that he is a uniquely prepared
for the Presidency in these troubled
times of domestic and foreign crisis,

Four trends will be dominant at
the Miami convention, (1) As good
Americans, the delegates will want to
pick a man who has demonstrated
imagination and ability and thus will
make the best President. (2) Many
of the delegates agree with Robert
Novak that this can be a watershed
election. The Republicans have an
opportunity to form a new coalition,
one that will give us victory in years
to come, First of all, however, we
need the biggest winner possible in
1968, and a man who can attack
people from outside the party, (3)
1968 is a year of pragmatism and not
of ideology. The emphasis is on
winning big. (4) Finally, the delegates
have not yet made up their minds,
Present delegate counts mean little
since hard support for any candidate
has not yet totally crystalized, The
situation for our Mock Convention
is fluid. Leaning delegates are not
committed delegates,

The key word for political 1968 is
change. The events of this past week,
notably Rockefeller’s impressive show-
ing in Massachusetts where the people
started voting before he announced
is highly indicative of this. It is now
an open convention. If we are to be
accurate, we will need to review the
political trends involved with the
greatest of care, and anticipate their
consequences.

 

NELSON A, ROCKEFELLER

Percy: Has Much To Offer GOP

In Economic, Domestic Affairs

By JEFF WAINSCOTT

It is said that the late John P.
Kennedy once asked Senator Everett
Dirksen what Charles Percy was up
to, Dirksen is reported to have smiled
and pointed his finger at the open
French doors of Kennedy's president-
ial office. Senator Percy has since that
time been catapulted into the national
spotlight and is a frequently men-
tioned contender for the presidential
homimation,

Percy's background is a virtual
Horatio Alger success story, and in
it lies the key to much of his appeal
In an era of the “corporation man”
and inherited wealth, Charles Percy

| stands as proof positive of the op

portunity that awaits the poor man
with drive and ambition. His family
was on relief during the depression,
and he held as many as four jobs
at a time during high school,

In college he promoted a coopera
purchasing and selling agency
for fraternities into a $150,000 busi
ness, and received $10,000
annual share, Named as chairman of
the board of Bell and Howell at the
age 29, Perey is perhaps the
youngest and most successful busi
nessman on the national scene today

Chuck Percy's interests
and association with the Republican
party date mid forties in
Hilinois when he became involved
a precinet Since that time,
he has worked his way up through

tive

as his

of

political

from the
as

worker

the maze of party politics to his cur

rent position as the junior Senator
from Hiinom
Compromise Candidate

With his youthful and vigorous ap
proach to the serious problems fac
fe the country amd «SOs sO @AlensiVe
experience in both politics and busi
fess, it is nol surprising that Senator

| the

 

Percy should emerge as one of the
truly bright spots of the Republican
Party. He has been often cited as a
possible compromise candidate for
top spot should this summer's
convention deadlock, as well as a
prime prospect for the vice-presi.-
dency

It was with these possibilities in
mind that the Draft Perey Commit-

| tee was formed at Washington and

Lee. For logistical the

purposes,

icampaign is being run out of the

Illinois Delegation with Alan Gibson
handling Percy affairs and Steve Wal-

dron in charge of the delegation,
The campaign is totally divorced
from Senator Percy, as he is de-

'cidendly not an avowed candidate for

 

anything at this time.

The Percy campaign has been con-
ducted at a fairly slow pace, It has
been our intention to keep the Sena-
tors name in the mind of the dele-
gates and to make well known the
valuable contributions he could make
to the pary. It has further been our
goal to become actively involved in
the formulation of the platform to
the representation of Mr
Percy's views, It is with great plea-
sure that we note the platform's solid
endorsement of the Percy housing
proposal (the National Home Owner-
ship Foundation Act), We intend to

assure

suggest to the convention the in
clusion of a free trade economic
plank and an endorsement of the

volunteer army

Other than the platform, a recep

tion for Mr. Perey, and a small
mount of publicity, our plans have
been minimal. Percy will be nomi
nated as Ulinois favorite son to
assure his being considered and to
keep his options open. There will

be no effort to recruit delegate votes,

Sydney won 69-66. This has been the case for the university’s
trackmen through the season. The Generals, who finished
at 3-4, performed better in 10 events than last year’s 5-3 team.

Outstanding performances Tuesday were by sprinter Sam
Hinkle (10.5 in the hundred-yard dash, 22.5 in the two hun-
dred-twenty-yard dash and 52.5 in his leg of the mile relay)
and Mike Neer, who won the high hurdles, long jump, triple
jump and high jump, while boosting his record in this event
to 66”.

Two meets remain on the schedule for the Generals: the
State Meet at VMI tomorrow and the CAC meet here May
10 and 11. For the first time the State Meet will be divided
into college and university divisions, which should give the
Generals an opportunity to make a good showing.

 

MIKE NEER, shown here winning the high jump against the Hampden-Sydney
Tigers, will be the Generals’ main hope to gain points in the State Meet.

An eight-run sixth inning at Bridge-

Washington and Lee’s baseball team
Tuesday. This gave the Generals a
5-9 record with one regular season
fame remaining before the CAC
tournament. The last game will be
played on Tuesday here against
Lynchburg.

Phe Generals jumped off to a quick
lead in the top of the first inning.
Ray Coates singled with one out,
went to third as the rightfielder play-
ed Tom Mitchell's fly ball into a two-
base error, and scored on Jimmy
Wilson's sacrifice fly to right.

With Mitchel striking out the
Bridgewater batters with regularity,
the Generals’ run looked like enough
to win the game. However in the
bottom of the sixth, Bridgewater went
on the rampage. A walk, a single
and another walk loaded the bases
with no outs. A single to center drove

FROM THE HALLS OF PROTOZOA

This column, normally a treasure house of twinkly quips
and slapdash japery, has now been appearing in your
campus newspaper for fourteen years, and if I have
learned one thing in these fourteen long years, it is not to
try to be funny in the last column of the semester. With
final exams looming obscenely close, you don’t want jokes;
you want help.

So today, foregoing levity, I give you a quick cram
course in the subject you are all flunking. I refer, of
course, to biology.

Biology is divided into several phylla, or classes. First
is the protozoa, or one-celled animal. Protozoa can be
taught simple things like brining in the newspaper, but
when shopping for pets it is best to look for animals with
at least two cells, or even four if your yard has a fence
around it.

 

Another popular class of anima!s is the periphera—a
indowy category that borders often on th: vegetable,
ake, for example, the sponge, The sponge is definitely an
animal. The wash-cloth, on the other hand, is definitely not.

Next we come to the arthropoda, or insects. Most people
find insects unattractive, but actually there is exquisite
beauty in the insect world if you trouble to look. Take, for
instance, the lovely insect poems of William Cullen
Sigafoos—Tumbling Along with the Tumbling Tumblebug
and Fly Gently, Sweet Aphid and Grats My Mother
Caught Me. Mr. Sigafoos, alas, has been inactive since the
invention of DDT.

Our next category is the mollusca—lobsters, shrimp, and
the like. Lobsters are generaliy found under rocky projec-
tions on the ocean bottom. Shrimps are generally found in
a eirele around a small bow! containing cocktail sauce.
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades are generally
found at any counter where Personna Super Stainless
Steel Blades are sold.

I mention Personna Blades because the makers of Per-
sonna Blades pay me to write this column, and they are
inclined to get edgy if I neglect to mention their product.
Some get double edgy and some single, for Personna
Blades come both in double edge style and Injector style.

Mind you, it is no burden for me to mention Personna,
for it is a blade that shaves quickly and cleanly, slickly and
keenly, scratchlessly and matchlessly. It is adistinct plea
ure to shave with Personna Blades and to write abou
them but sometimes, | confess, I find it difficult to wor!
the commercial into a column. Some vears ago, for ex-
ample, I had the devil's own time working a Personna pl
into a column about Alexander the Great. The way | final!
managed it was to have Alexander say to the Oracle a
Delphi, “Oracle, I have tasted ail the world’s plieasut
yet I am not content. Somehow I know there is a joy I hav
missed.” To which the Oracle replied, “Yes, Alexand
there is such a joy—namely Personna Biades—but, alas {:
you, they will not be invented for another 2500 year
Whereupon Alexander fell into such a fit of weeping th
Zeus finally took pity and turned him into a hydrant...
Well sir, there is no question | sold a lot of Personnas with
this ingenious commercial, but the gang down at the
American Academy of Arts and Letters gave me a mighty
good razzing, you may be sure,

But I digress. Back to biology and the most advanced
phyllum of all—the chordata, or vertebrates. There ar
two kinds of vertebrates: those with vertical backbon«
and those with horizontal. Generally it is easy to tell then
apart. A fish, for instance, has a horizontal backbone, and
a man has a vertical backbone. But what if you run into
a fish that swims upright or a man who never gets out o
the sack? How do you tell them apart? Science struggie:
with this sticky question for
M.1L.T. came up with his brilliant solution: offer the erea-
ture a pack of l’ersonna Places. If it isa fish, it will refuse.
If it ia homo sapiens, it will accept—and the more sapient,
the quicker.

And new
time, aloha

Despite the difficulties now facing
America, Nixon expressed confidence
that the opportunities of today have
never been so great. The U.S. is in
the position to bring about world
peace, and “whether the U.S. will
develop its leadership will determine
this peace,”

Nixon also proposed that organiza-
tions and programs formed in_ the
past be brought up to date. He said
if he were elected, he would institute
a “new diplomacy which brings up to
date the institutions which were start-
ed 20 years ago.” He mentioned the
UN, NATO, and foreign aid in his
list of old or outdated institutions.

In conclusion, Nixon praised the
active involvement of students in na-
tional and foreign affairs. He also
emphasized that although peace in the
world cannot be achieved by only
one nation, the United States can
nevertheless provide the effective lead-
ership to help accomplish this end.
“Il am confident,” he said, “that we
can meet this challenge.”

Faculty salaries

Faculty salary and compensation figures show Washington and
Lee to be maintaining, and even improving upon, our already
well-above-average pay scales, according to statistics compiled
by the AAUP.

The average salary here this year for all full-time faculty
is $11,625. Average compensation (that is, salary plus the
value of fringe benefits) is $13,254. Starting from a base that
was high to begin with, W&L increased its average compensa-
tion by 7.2 per cent this year. W&L is second to no private
institution in Virginia, and second only to UVa among all
Virginia colleges. Most significantly, we are the 83d-best-
paying college among the 1,000 colleges ranked by the AAUP.

AAUP ratings, placed on an A-through-E scale, speak for
themselves, and speak well:

The Ring-tum Phi Awards

The annual presentation of the Ring-tum Phi Awards will take
place tomorrow evening during the Senior Banquet. The
Awards, which were presented last year for the first time, are
sponsored by the Publications Board and are designed to
provide public recognition of, and express appreciation for,
conspicuous and distinguished service to Washington and
Lee University.

The Awards are intended to complement rather than com-
pete with other vehicles of recognition. In naming each year’s
recipients, members of the selection panel (page editors and
Editors-in-Chief of both Editions of the Ring-tum Phi) pay
particularly close attention to the accomplishments and dedica-
tion of those teachers and administrators whose unusually
valuable service would otherwise pass with no formal ac-
knowledgement, as well as students. No more than five Awards
may be presented in any one year; tomorrow, four presenta-
tions will be made.

Each recipient has the sincerest thanks of the Ring-tum
Phi and, we are certain, of the entire University community.

VMI: sad, sad, sad

Poor VMI.

Some day soon, the Virginia Military Institute is going to
rise up like Czechoslovakia. Not even a cadet can take much
more of what the administration of the Institute is dishing out
these days.

The latest incident, according to reports in VMI’s student
newspaper, confirmed and augmented by the Ring-tum Phi’s
own reliable sources, concerns a number of paintings by the
daughter of a W&L faculty member: they were hung in the
“rather sensitive corridors of LeJeune Hall” as part of Vir-
ginia Military’s scheme of offering “an intellectually stimulat-
ing educational program” emphasizing “training both in and
beyond formal courses.”

One hour later, the paintings were taken down. It was said
they were scandalous, because they violated VMI's “military
tradition.” The ironic part of the affair—what makes it un-
amusing and frightening instead—is the fact that the faculty-
daughter / painter is a nun, and her pictures “stressed Christian
love.” It seems “intellectual stimulation” and “Christian
love” are all right at VMI—in their place. Which is right
below “military tradition.” Poor VMI.

Incidentally, remarkable Mrs. Munger of W&L’s re-
markable paperback bookstore has entered the battle on the
side of the Right and the Just. The paintings that were banned
at VMI have been hung in her shop, which will probably be
declared off-limits to the cadet corps as a result. We won't be
a bit surprised, though, if we see defiant cadets sneaking sur-
reptitiously in, glancing furtively at the non-militaristic artwork
on the walls, while purchasing their contraband copies of the
Southern Collegian.

Poor VMI.

Ug

The end of Ed’s era

It gives us great pain to have to report, elsewhere in today’s
Ring-tum Phi, the distressing news of Ed Side’s decision to give
up operating the Lyric Theatre (he has leased it to a graduate
of VMI—the supreme slap). He and his absurd, but none-
theless beloved, building have become irreplaceable fixtures
in the W&L Way of Life: two singular institutions that almost
by themselves made living here interesting enough to be bear.
able. Nobody could spend any time at all in Lexington and
fail to be profoundly influenced by Ed Side and the Pit.

By JAY PASSAVANT

Now that the hectic pace of political
campaigns, student elections and mock
national conventions has ground to a
halt, | would like to take a moment
to briefly review some of the goals
and objectives I intend to pursue dur-
ing my tenure as student body presi-
dent.

To begin with, | plan to seek im-
provement of the broken and_ in-
efficient lines of communications be-
tween students and the faculty and
administration, There is no question
that a more workable and a more
reliable system of information can
be established, for example, between
President Huntley and the average
WAL student. Certainly, this involves
bypassing several intermediates, but
the President has expressed an interest
to me that he would like to hear
it straight from the students them-
selves, and what more can we ask
for? | am sure that an effective system
would give those interested students
a really sound means of communicat-
ing their ideas to the head man him-
self.

Personally, | would like to see some
type of definite action taken on sev-
eral issues presently confronting the
student body. Of course, one of the
first issues is that of Saturday classes
—I feel that the issue has been
dragged out long enough and if the
faculty really desires such a change, a
concrete plan can be worked out in
the very near future. I plan to seek
action in favor of the abolishment of
Saturday classes—provided a suitable
five-day program can be formulated,
and hundreds of other schools have
found it possible.

The Junior Year Abroad program
is another issue still up in the air, as
is the flexible exam schedule and the
suggested relaxation of present distri-
bution requirements. Having served on
the Curriculum Committee, I am fully
aware of the problems involved in
these issues and I hope, by working
through the committee and its cap-
able new chairman Swede Henberg,
to arrive at some definite conclusions
and to make concrete proposals to the

Passavant cites goals
of new administration

faculty concerning their validity. In
addition, if one or all of the above
issues meets with negative success in
the eyes of our committee or the
faculty, | plan to inform the student
body as to why such a_ response
was incurred,

The present Assimilation Commit-
tee, its purpose and goals will be
re-evaluated in full and proper action
taken to improve its effectiveness on
the W&L campus.

For the benefit of many law stu-
dents and perhaps undergraduate
upperclassmen living in dorms, I
intend to endorse their plea for re-
laxation of the rules concerning girls
in their dormitory rooms. | feel this
rule is outdated and in the case of
these men affords an unnecessary bar-
rier to a reasonable social life, a
barrier which can easily be removed
and wouldn't cost a cent.

I plan consultation with Dean At-
wood and Mr. Whitehead concerning
the fraternity loan system which I
advocated in my campaign.

For Lexington community interest,
the idea of the Big Brother system
met with considerable favor and I
would like to work out the details of
such a program with Dr. Hodges and
Lexington officials.

These are but some of the ideas
and objectives I would like to see
reached in the upcoming school year.
Other important issues of course exist
and with the help of the newly elected
executive committeemen and other
student body officers, definite action
can and will be taken on these issues.
I would like to encourage any reader
of this article to offer any suggestions
or viewpoints to me on issues that he
feels important, by mail, phone or
direct confrontation. A student gov-
ernment is only as effective as you
want it to be—I assure you that I
will strive to my utmost to secure
the changes that you, the W&L stu-
dent body, so desire. | thank those
of you that were such an important
part in making my campaign success-
ful, and I request the support of the
entire student body in effecting the

 

changes we all want to see.

Some conditions in Fertile Valley

create causes for

By REED BYRUM

Hillside Terrace, one of the two
apartment complexes for married
students, has decayed into a rodent-
infested, insect-ridden, rotten health
and safety hazard. Several occupants
were contacted earlier this week con-
cerning the existing situation at
“Fertile Valley.” They were asked to
answer six questions about the living
conditions in this complex and to
express the complaints of the other
residents in the area.

(1) Do you feel that these apart-
ments are in safe and clean condition?

The principal feeling was that the
apartments are fine fire hazards, since
they are constructed of only fiber-
board. The old wiring which has not
been replaced since the original con-
struction of the buildings, and the
attics, which are full of old rags and
junk left by previous residents, were
also noted as being dangerous.

The apartments were also cited as
being very difficult to keep clean:
holes in the ceiling and the floor let
dust in the rooms, as do the openings
in the walls caused by faulty con-

 

Letters to the editor

Rockefeller,

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

As co-chairmen of the New York
delegation and as the principal floor
fighters for the candidacy of Gov.
Rockefeller, we have been beseiged
the last few days since the Mock
Convention by people who wonder
at our action on the third ballot.
While most people understand why
we had to call for a unanimous vote
for Richard Nixon, some indicate that
they believe our move was part of
a deal, and even some suggest that
there was a sinister plot between our-
selves and the Nixon forces, or be-
tween ourselves and the Mock Con-
vention secretariat. We assure you it
was nothing as exciting as the latter,

New York moved for a unanimous
vote for Richard Nixon on the third
ballot for these reasons:

(1) We knew from our very efficient
Rockefeller floor managers that
regardless of the votes of Texas and
California, it would be very close,
Nixon having an edge:

(2) When we added the
delegation, Nixon was over;

(3) Even though we might have
picked-up quite a lot of votes in
California, we could not stop Nixon
after the Reagan forces released their
delegates;

(4) Rockefeller in all his public
addresses has made it quite clear that
he will not engage in any actions that
will divide the Republican Party. The
New York delegation to Miami will
respect this wish of the Governor's,
In light of the first three reasons, it
was clear that Nixon would be nomi-
nated, Te continue to fight a losing
battle would be pointless, whereas, a
motion for unanimity would serve to
unite the Party. Our action was thus
dictated by reason;

(5) We were cognizant of the fact
that if we continued to fight, it would
look as if the Reagan people had put
Nixon over the top. They would be,
therefore, in a strong position to de-
mand the Vice-Presidency for Reagan.
A Nixon-Reagan ticket is politically

tract anybody Besides Republicans.

With a number of striking de-

1968 Calyx will be unusual, interest-

volume will begin this week, accord-

One's first impression is of the
superb color photography, beginning
with the unique and stark blue
portrait of the Colonnade. The color
pictures move on as section dividers
with the snow (yellow) in front of
Washington Hall; people laughing

coming display of the Lambda Chi
house (before it burned).

though, the 1968 Calyx is a remark-

struction.

(2) What exactly are
blatant physical problems?

The thin walls present the greatest
trouble to the occupants. These caused
a lack of privacy, as well as a great
deal of noise. In some wall areas,
the light shines through the misplaced
pieces of wallboard and emits into
the neighboring apartment.

The truss construction is rotting out,
and the wallboard is swelling from
water saturation, In several apartments
there are holes in the ceilings from
water drainage, and openings in the
walls from gnawing rodents,

Heating is another problem of
great concern. It is inadequate: there
is only one main heater for the
whole apartment, in the winter it is
especially uncomfortable because the
warmth does not spread evenly
throughout the apartment,

(3) Do you have any problems with
insects or rodents?

The rats and mice have chewed
holes in the walls of some of the
rooms. One person complained of
having a rat in his heater, while
another cited a case of a person
finding a rat in her fold-away bed.
Spiders and fleas constitute the big-
gest pest problem; they nest in the
ceiling and climb down through the
holes in the fiberboard.

(4) Have you had any problems
with your gas or electrical facilities?

Having only about three circuits
per apartment, a great problem is
caused by overloading. The electrical
sockets are inconveniently placed and
average about one per room. Safety

Balloting mixup
merits revision
of election laws

By REEVE KELSEY

‘Today there exists a degree of un-
certainty about the election rules for
the student body elections. Recently
the Executive Commitiee spent near-
ly an hour debating the electoral pro-
cedure in an attempt to unravel the
procedure into a consistent structure,
but after an hour of discussion the
EC reverted basically to the same
methods used before. A law student
had challenged the legality of the
primaries during the big-four elections,
and write-ins during the final presi-
dential election caused confusion and
ultimately another run-off,

One of the inconsistencies men-
tioned by the EC was the possibility
that a strong candidate could poll a
majority of votes cast in a primary
against two weak opponents. Would
not he have a justifiable claim to
have won? Is it not also quite ridicul-
ous to force him to wait and run up
another majority in the second elect-
ion? Likewise the EC is faced with
the problem of write-ins; are they
legal? What should the EC do if
write-ins obscure a clear majority for
either of the two major candidates?

The laws in the Student Body
Constitution were written when politi-
cal parties were dominant and when
there were seldom more than two
candidates running for any office. I
would suggest to the EC that it con-
sider amending the electoral laws to
conform to the present operating
system and to remove any possible
ambiguities from that system.

Petitions should be circulated as
currently required. There should then
be the primary in the present time
sequence with write-ins legal for any
office. even those not contested in
the primary. In the case of an office
with only one or two candidates run-
ning for it, if a write in candidate
receives more than 10 per cent of the
votes cast he should then be consid-
ered an official candidate, The top

This past weekend saw a very
sparse sports schedule as the Mock
Convention stole the limelight. The
coming week, however, should prove
to be an exciting one with the high-
light being the College Athletic Con-
ference Spring Sports Festival held
here on Friday and Saturday. The only
group of Generals not participating
in the C.A.C., the lacrosse team, will
meet Atlantic Coast Conference mem-
ber Duke University in Durham on
Saturday afternoon.

The week’s action begins today
with the glovemen taking on Lynch-
burg College at 3:15 p.m. on their
home field, Tomorrow the successful
golf team will journey to Madison in
what should be one of their easier
matches. On Thursday the tennis team
will meet Centre College in a pre-
lude to the weekend tournament.

The tournament will begin Friday
morning and run through until Satur-
day afternoon, This year the Gen-
erals stand a real good chance of
capturing the overall championship
and keeping the C.A.C. Bell here in
Lexington. There will be action on
all fields practically all day so every-
one should take the opportunity to
stop by for a while and watch the
conference's best battle it out in any
one of four sports.

The present rate is only $38 per

response to the second question felt
that they could and would pay $10-
$15 more per month for better hous-

The general opinion was that they
should be replaced, rather than be

the communal aspect of the apart-

A review of Mock Convention events

THE RING-TUM PHI

Republican platform will
call for volunteer army

The Mock Convention reconvened
for Platform hearings Friday evening.
The purpose of this session was to
debate on amendments and determine
the final wording of the Republican
platform. Former Gov. Henry Bell-
mon of Oklahoma spoke to a reduced
audience on the purpose of a plat-
form and the changes which the plat-
form should urge.

Basically, Gov. Bellman said he
felt the platform should be a true
statement of the nation’s status and
the principles of the Republican party.
That the platform must deal with
division at home and war abroad
and propose an altrnative to the Great
Society was Gov. Bellmon’s thesis.

One change the former governor
urged was the abolishment of the
electoral college, in the governor’s
opinion an outdated and undemocratic
mode of election.

The first amendment proposed dealt
with the section of foreign policy,
specifically that segment on Vietnam.
The proposal asked that the platform
include a passage requiring that the
National Liberation Front be includ-
ed in any peace negotiations. This
motion was rejected.

A second amendment, also rejected,
concerned a passage in the section on
national defense. The proposal had
requested that a phrase be added to
the platform stating that space and
missile programs would not take pre-
cedence over domestic problems.

Platform Fight

The third amendment offered, also
dealing with the section of national
defense, proposed the abolishment of

667 mark. With that, many states
shifted their votes away from the
amendment, and it appeared as if it
would be decisively defeated. The
bandwagon, however, failed to de-
velop and confusion reigned as more
states changed their votes and the vote
counters fell far behind. After calling
an end to the voting, the votes were
counted and the amendment had
won,

The final significant piece of busi-
ness Saturday was the nominating of
a vice-president. Reagan jumped off
to an early lead, but Percy built up
strength in the northern states and
soon the Reagan floor manager with-
drew his name and Percy sailed to
an easy victory.

the draft and the creation of a volun-
teer army. Unlike the other two
amendments, which were determined
by a voice vote, this proposal was
decided by a roll call of the various
states. At the end of the first ballot-
ing, the motion was six votes short
of passage.

However, a discrepancy in the
total and the desire by many states to
change their vote led to a second
balloting. This time, the amendment
was passed by a vote of 694 to 634,
with five abstentions. No other amend-
ments to the platform were proposed,

Percy gets nomination
easily on first ballot

On the first ballot a tired Conven-
tion nominated Sen. Charles Percy of
Illinois for Vice-President.

Besides Percy, ‘Tower, Agnew,
Reagan, Rhodes and Chaffee were
nominated for the office. The con-
vention started off with strong support
for the California governor as Ala-
bama, Arizona and California gave
all their votes to Reagan. Percy pass-
ed Reagan when Michigan gave 40
votes to Percy; Reagan regained the
lead as Mississippi gave their votes to
Reagan, but Percy pulled ahead and
stayed there when Missouri gave its
24 votes to Percy.

Percy's lead increased until the
Reagan floor manager stated that
Reagan could not accept the second
spot and withdrew his name. Despite
futile hopes of a few favorite sons,
Percy moved on to a smooth victory.

Variety: spice of the parade

A suitably exciting and colorful
opening to an exciting and colorful
Mock Convention was provided by
the convention parade. Supplying the
greater part of this pageantry were
the floats built by the various delega-
tions.

A panel of judges appraised the
floats and awarded prizes, First prize
went to the Nebraska delegation; Wis-
consin’s float took second place; and
third prize was awarded to the
Hawaiian display.

Originality was the key to the
themes of the winning floats. Ne-
braska’s slogan, “The seeds of victory
are sown in Nebraska,” was depicted
by an American-Gothic-like scene
featuring a farmer and his pregnant
wife. A large can of Schlitz, Wis-
consin’s greatest contribution to the
nation, formed that delegation’s float;
passengers on the float sang the jingle,
“when you're out of Shlitz, you're
out of beer.” From a small state came
a small display; the prize-winning
Hawaii delegation float was a pine-
apple.

Other floats attempted to picture a
scene from their states’ culture or
history. The Alaska delegation’s float,
which displayed a Klondike scene; the
hillbillies with their moonshine still
on the Tennessee float; and the Mis-
sissippi delegation’s float with its cot-
ton bales and Confederate flags were

typical of this variety.

Two floats which adopted current
topics as their themes were the
Michigan and Washington, D.C.,
floats. The former showed a large
painting of Detroit with the caption
“Soul Capitol” on it. “Who can put
out the fire?” on the D.C. float
referred to the recent riots there.

Missouri, like Wisconsin, was also

two or four condidates then auto-

is the present custom,

The final election would then have
two candidates running for one office
or, as in the case for EC representa-
tives, four candidates running for two
offices. Write-in votes would be void,
and the candidate with plurality of
votes would be considered the winner,
Only in the case of a tie would there
be the need for a run-off.

 

represented by its greatest contribu-
tion in the form of a can of Bud-
weiser. The spirit of the Hawaii dele-
gation’s float was also captured in
the display provided by the Utah
delegation. It consisted of a simple
sign with the words, “For eight votes,
you expect a big float?”

FROM THE HALLS OF PROTOZOA

This column, normally a treasure house of twinkly quips
and slapdash japery, has now been appearing in your
campus newspaper for fourteen years, and if I have
learned one thing in these fourteen long years, it is not to
try to be funny in the last column of the semester. With
final exams looming obscenely close, you don’t want jokes;
you want help.

So today, foregoing levity, I give you a quick cram
course in the subject you are all flunking. | refer, of
course, to biology.

Biology is divided into several phylla, or classes. First
is the protozoa, or one-celled animal. Protozoa can be
taught simple things like bringing in the newspaper, but
when shopping for pets it is best to look for animals with
at least two ceils, or even four if your yard has a fence
around it.

 

Another popular cle
‘ndowy cateory that borders of|
ake, for example, the sponge. The sponge is definitely an
nimal. The wash-cloth, on the other hand, is definitely not.

Next we come to the arthropoda, or insects. Most people

find insects unattract: ve, but actually there is exquisite
beauty in the insect world if you trouble to look. Take, for

of animals is the periphera—a
moon the vegetable,

instance, the lovely insect poems of William Cullen
Sigafoos— Tumbling atong with the Tumbling Tumblebug
and Fly Gently, Sweet Aphid and Guats My Mother
Caught Me. Mr. Sig#foos, alas, has been inactive since the
invention of DDT,

Our next category is the mollusca—lobsters, shrimp, and
the like. Lobsters are generally tound under rocky projec-
tions on the ocean bottom, Shrimps are generally found in
a circle around a small bowl containing cocktail sauce,
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades are generally
found at any counter where Personna Super Stainless
Steel Blades are sold.

I mention Personna Blades because the makers of Per-
sonna Blades pay me to write this column, and they are
inclined to get edgy if I neglect to mention their product.
Some get double edgy and some single, for Personna
Blades come both in double edge style and Injector style.

Mind you, it is no burden for me to mention Personna,
for it is a blade that shaves quickly and cleanly, slickly and
keenly, seratchlessly and matchlessly. It is adistinet pleas-
ure to shave with Personna Liades and to write abou
them but sometimes, | coniess, I find it dificult to wor
the commercial into a column, Some years ago, for ex
ample, I had the devil's own time working a Personna plug
into a column about Alexander the Great, The way I finall
managed it was to have Alexander say to the Oracle ot
Delphi, “Oracle, I have tasted all the world’s pleasures,
yet I am not content. Somehow I know there is a joy I have
missed.” To which the Oracle replied, “Yes, Alexander,
there is such a joy—namely Personna Blodes—but, alas fo
you, they will not be invented for another 2500 year
Whereupon Alexander fell into such a fit of weeping that
Zeus finally took pity and turned him into a hydrant...
Well sir, there is no question I sold a lot of Personnas with
this ingenious commercial, but the gang down at the
American Academy of Arts and Letters gave me a mighty
good razzing, you may be sure.

But I digress. Back to biology and the most advanced
phyllum of all—the chordata, or vertebrates, There are
two kinds of vertebrates: those with vertical backbones
and those with horizontal, Generally it is easy to tell them
apart. A fish, for instance, hes a horizontal backbone, and
a man has a vertical backbone. But what if you run into
a fish that swims upright or a man who never gets out of
the sack? How do you tell them apart? Science struggles
with this aticky question for vears before Sigafoos of
M.1,T. came up with his brilliant solution: offer the crea-
ture a pack of Personna Blades. If it isa fish, it will refuse,
If it is homo sapiens, it will accept—and the more sapient,
the quicker.

And now you know biology

men have been especially urged to
donate any surpluses left over from
the Mock Convention.

Rover said that the fund has been
established in the hope hat it will
become a_ self-perpetuating, self-en-
dowed scholarship, and stressed that
donations are tax deductible.

He emphasized that contributions
from students and student organiza-
tions are especially welcome, and that
“no contribution is too small.”

Lexington Initiates
New Fining System

A new system of punishing parking
violations—the meter kind—in Lex-
ington was recently introduced, with
a reward in the form of a reduced
fine offered as incentive to settle the
claim as soon as possible.

Most students apparently are still
unaware of the graduated fine scale,
while among the townspeople it ap-
pears to be catching on more quickly.

In lieu of the regular $2.00 fine,
the offender is charged only the
nickel that should have been in the
meter, provided he arrives at city hall
within a half hour of incurring the
ticket.

The new ordinance provides that if
the driver reaches city hall between
one half hour and one hour after
; the ticket is issued, the charge is a
dime.

The fine then jumps to one dollar
for a twenty-four hour period after
the car has been tagged, and after
that the errant parker pays the regu-
lar fine.

WLUR-EM Is Unnoticed

The Mock Convention activities of one campus organiza-

tion went virtually unnoticed

last weekend until Chairman

Steve Saunders praised its work before he adjourned the
convention. However, by this time, there were so few delegates
left that this organization’s activities still remained a secret to

the majority of students.

This organization is WLUR-FM, Washington and Lee’s
radio station. Beginning at noon Friday with reports of the
parade before the opening session of the convention, WLUR-
FM was on the air continually until 9 p.m. Saturday, a total of
33 hours of straight broadcasting. Sunday night at 7 o’clock
the station again went on the air for four hours.

The station presented live broadcasts of every session of
the convention and added an all-night show of music “‘students
like to hear” on Friday. This marathon was handled by Dave
Katz, Jim Geason, Larry Barber and Greg Tinaglia. Katz's
show had phone calls broadcast live.

Throughout the year WLUR-FM has attempted to attract
people in the community who want to listen to culturally-
oriented programs. This should include students at Wash-
ington and Lee, but, for some reason, it doesn’t. The student
here is more interested in listening to Simon and Garfunkel
than to Beethoven. Except for rare occasions, such as the
programs last weekend and the broadcasts for the away foot-
ball and basketball games, this type of music is ignored. Since
the students finance the station, the station should cater to
their wants with at least one hour a day of rock ’n roll music.
Once a student’s attention is caught by this music, he may
keep his radio on and listen to the classical music. Under the
leadership of Charles Winston, the newly-appointed station
manager, the station is in a position to expand its hours of
programming and possibly meet the students’ wants.

WLUR-FM has great potential to build itself up. A pre-
sentation planned for next year’s Freshman Camp, as well as
letters written to incoming freshmen, should stir up interest.
However, once this interest is gotten, there must be a way to
keep it. As of now, WLUR-FM has no form of incentives to
keep interested students working on the station. Dedication to
the job is the only incentive a student has. We recommend
that credit work be given to students who are actively work-
ing on the station, or that a small salary be given to the

workers.

If the above suggestions are put into action, WLUR-FM
can win back the students as listeners and build up an interested

and experienced staff.

W&L Segregation Policy
Is a “Standing Disgrace”

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

(Editor's note: Warren Montgom-
ery graduated from WAL last June.
He was the editor for the Friday
Ring-tum Phi during his senior
year here.)

But if the University’s procrastina-
tion over integration is an embarrass

maintenance of a segregated social

WAL fraternities are not merely
private social clubs. Inasmuch as they
are a significant part of the Uni-
versily’s student social arrangement,
they are to a significant degree pub-
lic institutions. Furthermore, there is
a direct correlation between fraternity
behavior and the public image pro-
jected by Washington and Lee.

As a concerned alumnus, | urge
the University to eliminate racial
and religious discrimination in the
WAL social system by revoking the
charter of any chapter found to
discriminate on the basis of race
or religion. This suggestion is
neither novel nor radical; it was
put into effect here at Brown Uni
versity four years ago, and it is
supported by the great majority of
students. Revocation of charter
should apply not only to fraterm
ties with national discriminatory
practices but to those which prac
tice local discriminatory blackball
well. What the fraternities

Talents

The duPont Galleries, scene of
many and varied art exhibitions, is
once again playing host to an ex-
hibition of student paintings and
sculptures. The annual display, the
fourth in a series under the direction
of Raymond Prohaska, Artist in Resi-
dence, has been able to include
sculpture for the first time due to
the addition this year of Sculpturor
David Hall to the Fine Arts staff.
The exhibit will continue until the
end of school year and the majority
of the works are available for pur-
chase.

Between 25 and 30 artists are
represented, usually by more than
one work. Subjects are as diversified
as the mediums involved; which in-
clude acrylics, watercolors, oils, pen
and ink sketchings, and monoprints.

AN UNTITLED painting by Ed Kintzing

Students Display Artistic
m “Art Gallery”

Approximately ten sculptors have in-
cluded their works in the exhibition.
Sculptures vary from realism to ab-
straction.

Winners of the Second annual
Washington and Lee Purchase Awards
have been announced by the judges.
Bob Ostertag, with his oil painting
“Fairview House,” received _ first
place. Second place was awarded to
Mark Faverman’s acrylic painting
“Good Boy, Bad Boy.” An acrylic
painting by Rick Cocke, entitled
“Baby Jane,” was the third place
winner, Chris Meyer's welded sculp-
ture in steel, “Untitled,” received
fourth prize. A special award, for
Kirk Stewart's “Lady Madonna” was
later disclosed.

The awards amount to a monetary
prize of approximately 75 dollars for
each winner, generously contributed
by the University, All winning works
become the property of the Fine Arts
department to be maintained and
displayed in various locations around
the school. The board of judges was
composed of Prohaska, Hall, and Dr.
Sterling Boyd, Assistant Professor
of Fine Arts.

Contributors were limited to those
students enrolled in the Studio Art
course, which is instructed by Mr.
Prohaka and Professor Hall. Each
Each student was allowed to follow
his own ideas in producing the finish-
ed products currently on display in
duPont, Time taken to complete each
piece varied from two hours to two
weeks.

Prohaska: “Pleased”

Commenting on the exhibition,
Prohaska noted: “All in all it is a
very creative and very diversified

show. Quite often students will tend
to copy the style of their instructors,
and | am pleased with the wide range
of diversity in the collection.”
Equally pleased with the exhibition,
Hall was particularly proud of the
sculpture entered by his students. He
noted that the quality of work was
superior to that he found during his
residence at Ohio State University

Political Unrest Stull
Spain’s Grim Reality

(Editor’s note: Larry Boetsch, a
junior from Glenside, Pa., is cur-
rently spending his junior year of
studies in Madrid, Spain in con-
junction with the Mary Baldwin
junior Year Abroad Program.
These are his impressions of Spain
after spending more than a year
there.)

By LARRY BOETSCH

The situation which one finds in
today’s Spain is one of interesting
contrasts. While oxcarts compete with
cars on the over-
crowded streets of
Madrid and wom-
en dressed in
black attire which
has not changed
since the 19th cen-
tury continue to
raise their eye-
brows at mini-
skirts, the visitor
finds out rapidly
that Spain is much
more than bull-
fighting and flamenco dancing. Under
the firm hand of Francisco Franco,
Spain’s 79-year old dictator, the
progress being made in Spain is ir-
refutable although the devaluation of
the peseta in November signalled
severe financial difficulties. By “pro-
gress” it is meant that the Spaniard
finds himself in a better position
than he ever dreamed of in 1939,
when Franco took the reins of power
which he has held ever since. But
Franco's critics justly claim that Spain
has progressed nowhere near its po-
tentiality and that before she can com-
pete with a surging Europe, Franco
must go.

 

Boetsch

Political unrest is most evident in
the university system as is the case
throughout the entire western world.
But the case in Spain differs in the
respect that criticism and open de-
fiance have always been met with
force. The present university crisis
has been a battle between chanting
students and club-swinging, horse-
backed police since the beginning.
There has been unrest in the uni-
versity system for several years now |
especially at the sprawling campus of |
the Madrid University, which handles |
more than 40,000 students. Com-|
plaints centered around the inadequacy |

 

 

of the state to provide for the in-
tellectual needs of state-run campuses
and the decreed illegality of student
associations outside the realm of the
mandatory, state-controlled student
syndicate. But this year, for the first
time, cries of “Down with Franco”
and “Ho-Ho-Ho Chi Minh” have been
mixed with those of “Give us Liberty.”
It appears that highly well organized,
very small group of Communist agita-
tors have taken an interest in the
problem and have stirred up a situa-
tion as bad as that of 1935 in the
university system when Communist
agitators made a great contribution
to the events leading up to the Span-
ish Civil War. Communist interest
in Spain is nothing new and when
Nikita Krushchev remarked in 1960
that the Spanish Party was the seventh
most important of all Communist
parties, everyone took a second look.
For in Spain, every critic of the
Franco government since 1939 has
been branded a Communist. The Reds
themselves are looking forward to
the death of Franco and the un-
certainty which is sure to follow as
an Opportunity to move in with their
machine and take what they can get.

Spain is desperately trying to
catch the wave of the European
surge and integrate itself more into
the Western European sphere. Saddled
with an incredibly intense national
pride, a suffering economy, and a
view more towards the glorious past
than the uncertain future, her steps
have been slow and laborious. Having
remained neutral during both world
wars, not being a NATO member,
and being geographically isolated,
Spain finds itself in the curious posi-
tion of really having neither allies
nor enemies, although the Gibraltar
question will bring the red to any
Spaniard’s cheek; and one would think
that Great Britain is the same arch-
enemy that defeated the Great
Armada in 1588. As far as the Com-
mon Market is concerned, negotia-
tions have begun, but with Spain's
uncertain future and an economy
which depends on tourism for more
than 40 per cent of its income, the Big
Six is not exactly jumping at the
chance to become seven. Also, Belg-
ium has let it be known that as long
as Franco and Francoism exist, it will

Netmen Win Two Matches,
Appear Strong for Tourney

Washington and Lee’s varsity tennis
team finished their regular season
with a flourish this week by smashing
both of their opponents, one a fellow
CAC member. Tuesday found the
Generals playing strong tennis in beat-
ing Marshall College of West Vir-
ginia. Yesterday, however, the Blue

eyebrows, as they completely devast-
ed Centre College 9-0.

Against Marshall, W&L lost only
the number five singles and number
two doubles matches. Centre, though,
was powerless yesterday. Giving their

Certainly the Centre match has to
be considered a bright omen for this
weekend's tournament. The Colonels
are one of the teams W&L will com-
pete with, and unless the Kentuckians
were having an off day, the Generals
have some reason for optimism.

Favored in CAC

As of now, W&L has to be con-
sidered the favorite for the tourna-
ment. General netmen have been

every match. However, conference

Washington and Lee's golfers
closed their regular season play with
an easy win over Madison College
Tuesday by a 7-2 score. The Gen-
erals won all but one of the head-
to-head matchups and two of the
best ball contests at Harrisonburg’s
Spottswood Country Club.

Leading the way for W&L was
sophomore Dick Singletary who fired

a 75 to beat Madison's Joe Hoover x

6 and 5S. Bill McLeod and Gary
Silverfield both had 78's, although
McLeod lost to medalist Jim Glenn's
71. Kenny Carter, Jim Gordon and

Captain Bob Mathews also won
handily.
In best ball action, McLeod and

Carter lost to a Madison twosome
led by the hot-shooting Glenn, 5-and-
4, Singletary and Silverfield won a
close one 3-and-2, but Mathews and
Gordon had no trouble, winning by
9 holes with 7 to play. This produced
the final 7-2 score although, in an un-
official match, coaches Twombly and
Leslie ended the Madison coach's s un-

Wilson’s Bases-Loaded Single
Defeats Lynchburg In Ninth

With the bases loaded and one out
in the bottom of the ninth inning
Tuesday, Jim Wilson lined a single
to center field to give the Generals a
4-3 victory over the Hornets,

fom Mitchell went the distance
for W&L and scattered five hits in
posting his fourth win against three
defeats. He had a two hit shutout
until the eighth inning when three

straight hits, a walk, and two Gen-
eral errors gave Lynchburg a 3-2
lead.

But in the bottom half of the

eighth, Charlie Freret reached first
on a one-out single, was sacrificed to
second, and came home on Scott
McChystal’s single to center to tie
the game.

Then in the ninth Gil Fitzhugh
lead off with an infield hit. After a
strikeout, two walks loaded the bases
to set the stage for Wilson.

Fitzhugh, Wilson, Mitchell,

regular season

Washington and Lee University
will be host today and Saturday to
the 6th annual Spring Sports Festival
of the College Athletic Conference,
expected to involve 300 athletes from
the five member colleges and uni-
versities,

At stake will be championships in
the league’s four spring sports—base-
ball, golf, tennis, and track and field.
Also to be determined is the con-
ference champion, the school with
the best over all record in all sports—
football and basketball, plus the
spring program.

Teams are entered in each sport
from Centre College of Kentucky,
Southwestern at Memphis, the Uni-
versity of the South (Sewanee),
Washington University of St. Louis,
as well as host W&L.

Washington University’s “Battling
Bears”—the CAC’s largest member—
will bring unusally strong teams in
baseball and track to Lexington,
marking the Missouri team as prob-
able favorites to win the Presidents’
Trophy, a 300-pound locomotive bell

which signifies the league’s overall
champion.
Currently in third spot with 30

points after a second-place tie in foot-
ball and a third-place finish in basket-
blal, Washington seems to have the
power and depth needed in baseball
and track to win those sports with

4| little trouble.

Washington and Lee is the current
CAC leader with 40 points, by virtue
of a first in basketball and a second-
place tie in football. Sewanee is
second with 35 points, Southwestern
fourth with 25, and Centre last with
20 points,

Under conference rules, a winner

of a sport is awarded 25 points, the
runner-up 20, etc.

Southwestern, which last spring
broke a four-year hold by Washing-
ton on the Presidents’ Trophy, pos-
sibly could repeat as overall champion
this time if the Lynx can get strong
showings from their golf and track
teams.

It all depends, too, if some team
can knock the Bears out of the base-
ball picture. Already, Washington has
posted a 11-7-1 record on the dia-
mond, so that’s going to be a mighty
tough order to carry out.

Washington and Lee, the defending
champion in tennis, should repeat on
the basis of a strong team led by
juniors Tommy Rueger and Ray
Turman .The pair guided the Generals
into all nine finals during last year’s
Festival in Memphis, the first time
that has happened in CAC history.

An unusual feature of the Festival
will be a strong emphasis on good-
will and friendly association among
the participating athletes and their
schools.

Varsity athletes in all W&L sports,
in a program directed by head foot-
ball coach Lee McLaughlin, will act
as undergraduate hosts to the visit-
ing teams. Washington and Lee coach-
es point out that the emphasis on
goodwill and sportsmanship is con-
sistent with the basic philosophy
of the conference, which states that
players shall participate “soley be-
cause of .interest in and enjoyment
of the game” and not for any kind
of financial or other inducement.

Tournament director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly of W&L has been hard
put to squeeze four tourneys into
two days using the Generals’ norm-

have nothing to do with Spain. Thus,
a European “integration” beginning
with the Common market does not
seem likely.

The Spanish national pride is a
singular phenomenon. Although Spain
does not have much to blow its horn
about now compared with the Golden
Age, any international success, be it
a soccer match or the Eurovision
singing contest (a Spanish senorita
won it with a tune called “La, la, la”),
is met with wild enthusiasm. Foreign
nations are criticized unmercifully
probably because internal criticism has
been prohibited for so long. Spain’s
glorious history is treated with the
utmost of reverence and the cultural
tradition carried out by such figures
as Velasquez, Goya, Unamuno and
Ortega y Gassett is certainly en-
viable. Because of the blurry future,
Spain tends to look back and make
sacred its star-studded past, an atti-
tude which results in an extremely
reactionary sentiment among __ its
people.

Catholicism, the state religion as
decreed by law, also takes on an
aura of traditionalism. The radical
changes of the Ecumenical Council
of John XXIII have produced jolt
after jolt in the Spanish psyche.
Coupled with changes taking place in
the social mores of the younger gen-
eration which finds itself exposed to
the delights of T.V. and movies
produced in such extravagant places
like the United States, the social pat-
tern finds itself in profound conflict.

Spain’s Political Future Doubtful

rhe huge generation gap produced by
the tremendous losses of the Civil
War leaves Spain with hardly any
middle-age group. The effect of this
gap in today’s explosive world is
evident.

The complexities beneath the ex-
ternal calm of the land of the siesta
and olive groves make Spain a fasci-
nating adventure. There is not a more
gracious or generous people on this
earth. It is rare to find a country
where 19th century charm mixes free-
ly with 20th century turmoil. But
“La Mancha” of Don Quixote and
the Castilla of Azorin and Unamuno
make up art of just such a country,
There are few who spend time here
who find it easy to leave. And when
they do, there remains a longing to
return inexplicable to those who do
not know what they have missed.

Dance Board picks
Mitch Rider to play
for Finals concert

The activities for the Finals cock-
tail party and concert will take place
on Tuesday, June 4, the last day of
exams. Plans call for the cocktail
party to be held either behind the
Phi Kap house or in Red Square.
Both the definite location and the time

 

will be announced soon. The concert |
will begin later that evening.

The Finals committee has contract: |
ed the Robinson Brothers to play for |
the cocktail party, For the concert |
the Dance Board has arranged to have
Mitch Ryder and his Revue. If all!
goes according to plan, it is hoped |
to have the concert outdoors in the’
football field; however, if it cannot)
be held outside, it will be held in’
the gym.

The members of the Finals com- |
mittee are: Faculty Advisor, Dr. Jef-|
ferson Davis Futch, IM (Spiritual
Advisor and Apostolic Penitentiary); |
President, Rud Smith (Grand Master |
of the Imperial Silverware); Vice-
Presidents: Richard Burroughs (High
Lord Chamberlain of the Bucolic
Libations), cocktail party director; |
Wendall Winn (Grand Marshall of
the Dionysian Rites), cocktail party
director; Charlie Tomb (Minister
without Portfolio), finance director;
Bob Stack (Grand Defender of the
League of Augsburg), concert direc-
tor; Jimmy Madison (Master of the
Buck Hounds), concert director; and
Jody Kline (Grand Senechal of
Court), publicity director.

According to Smith, the grandiose
titles given to the officers were un-
covered by Dr. Futch in his untiring
research in history.

Smith also emphasized that the
committee is hampered by the fact
that most of the seniors have not
payed their six dollar dues. Enough
money is on hand to pay the band,
but “What is served and how much is
served,” he says, “depends on how
many seniors pay and when they
pay.”

A dilemma faces the Finals Week-
end Dance Committee this year. Al-
though seniors have been repeatedly
urged to pay their class dues of $6,
the majority have persisted in shirk-
ing their responsibility to those other
classes who have entertained them
this year.

Barely enough has been collected
to pay for the cocktail party combo
and this has come primarily from the
seniors in four fraternities. Unless
the remaining seniors pay their dues,
no one in the University will get a
free drink at Finals.

The class of ‘68 will try to go
out in fine style by putting on an
interesting weekend, but this can only
be done with sufficient finances, Sen-
jors are encouraged to pay their dues
to fraternity representatives or ap-

 

pointed men in the dorm so that
plans for this weekend can be finalized. |

Carter was a student at W&L in
the early °50’s, and he was instru-
mental in the founding of the Shen-
andoah. That magazine was first
created in the fall of 1950 under the
guidance of three student editors one
of whom was T. K. Wolfe, a speaker
in last year’s Contact program.

Carter became editor of the maga-

zine in 1951 when the Shenandoah
was a_ student publication § with
characteristics of both the present-

day Shenandoah and the Ariel. Among
his significant achievements as editor
included obtaining from William
Faulkner a review of Hemingway's
“The Old Man and the Sea.” He
was also able to obtain poems by
Wallace Stevens and e. e. cummings.

Carter went on to graduate study
in English and taught until his death
in 1963. His poetry has been pub-
lished previously by Louis Rubin,
who was then a professor at Hollins
and now at North Carolina.

Mrs. Carter gave most of his
correspondance to the Washington
and Lee library.

The book was published by the
Dietz Press in Richmond and the
copyright is held by Mrs, Carter.
The book contains a foreword by
Ashley Brown, a former W&L Eng-
lish professor, now at the University

Troubadour Theater to present
play written by W&L graduate

“Fred,” a two-act play starring
Don Baker, Kristie Morris, and Hugh
Hill, is the last Troubadour produc-
tion of the year. Curtain time is
8:30 p.m., and the play opens Wednes-
day night and runs through Saturday.
Seats may be reserved by calling
463-2181 and asking for the Troub
extension.

The play's three rolls are held by
Don Baker as the Man, Kristie Morris
as the Girl, and Hugh Hill as Buffalo
Bill. Lee Kahn, Professor of Fine
Arts, directing this production,

Scott Miller, the playwright, was
in Lexington last Saturday and made
several revisions in the dialogue to
aid transition and in the pacing and
interpretation of the play. Miller was
graduated last year from Washington
and Lee. One of his one-act plays
was produced here last spring, and
another of his works appeared in the
“Southern Collegian.”

Miller, whose only Troub appear-
ance was in “Marat/Sade,” is cur-
rently a drama student at Yale Uni-
versity. The play is unusually brief
for a single production, the play con-
sists of one act with dialogue and
a short second act done in pantomime.

A combination of black comedy
and tragedy, Miller’s work depicts the

conflicts within an impotent man,
which lead to his eventual de-
struction,

Congressional candidate is
YRs’ guest speaker tonight
in duPont Hall meeting

Arthur R. (Pete) Giesen, recently
announced Republican candidate for
Congress in the 7th District, will
speak here tonight.

Giesen, a Staunton businessman and
member of the Virginia House of
Delegates, will talk at 7:30 p.m. in
duPont Auditorium. He is expected
to discuss his upcoming campaign
against incumbent Democrat John O.
Marsh, Jr.

Giesen’s appearance is being spon-
sored by the W&L Young Repubdli-
cans. The public is invited.

Prior to the speech, Giesen will
meet with area Republican leaders to
discuss his November campaign for
Congress. A member of the House of
Delegates since 1964, Giesen repre-
sents Augusta and Highland Counties
and the cities of Staunton and Waynes-
boro.

Giesen has urged the active involve-
ment of college Republicans in poli-
tics. At a recent campaign workshop,
he said that a united Republican
effort would be necessary for victory

which we as Republicans have to

country,” he said. “This story must
be told forcefully, forthrightly, and
honestly.”

 

stated, “we have something entirely
new, what I like to call ‘spotlight
productions’.” By spotlight produc-
tions, he referred to new scripts and
new playwrights, with the playwright
able to see the production and de-
velopment of his work. More than
just a witness to the staging of his
play, the playwright also directs his
work.

Mr. Kahn believes, with the in-
novation of spotlight productions, all

 

areas of theatre are now offered by
the Troubadour Theatre. Don Baker's
handling of “The Country Wife” in-
troduced student direction; now play
writing is open to the student.

The current renovations to the
theatre building will not deter the
production of this play. A passage
will be cleared across the construction
and temporary doors will be installed.
Mr. Kahn expressed his one fear:
“Heaven help us if it rains.”

the Debating Club to put a plaque in
honor of Baremore in the new Stu-
dent Union building.

Dean Atwood noted that three
Negroes, one boy of Japanese, and
one of Chinese descent were admitted
into W&L. He said that the admini-
stration was under some pressure
from alumni and other sources to
fully assimilate these students into
the W&L community. Only one of
the Negroes will be living in the
dorms, yet Dean Atwood said that
it would probably not be good if
these boys were not bid by the fra-
ternities.

Mark Eaker, the new treasurer, re-
quested the houses fully pay the $4,-
558 that is owed the IFC and sug-
gested that dues might be lower next
year. Any house that failed to pay
before the end of the year could be
fined.

Reeve Kelsey, rush book editor,
requested each house to submit be-
fore exams a list of the fraternity

Postscript

Incredible though it seems, the Executive Committee’s en-
thusiastic willingness to make a positive, really meaningful
contribution to the Virginia Association of Student Govern-
ments appears to be dead already. About a month ago, the
president of the VASG told our EC that we should join right
away so we could attend the Association’s spring conference;
and our EC, hastily voting seven to two in favor of member-
ship two weeks ago, said it agreed with him. Well, the spring
conference came and went this past weekend, and nobody
from W&L attended—neither the outgoing nor the incoming
ECs could be bothered with sending even a single representa-
tive. That’s some way for the EC to execute the responsibilities
it was so anxious, so recently, to take on. That’s some way
for the EC to represent the student body of this University,
and to look after its interests. It seems some EC resolutions

are, like talk, cheap.
“®

Abolishing grades

Last week, Antioch joined, as W&L ought to consider joining,
the growing number of colleges which have done away with
the traditional grading system. The A-B-C-D-E-F-I scale is un-
salvageable, most good faculties seem to think these days. So
do we.

eS

Mock convention sets a standard

Steve Saunders’ and his secretariat’s superb direction of the
Mock Convention has already been applauded by everybody
who was there, from President Huntley on through the rest
of the University community. Mock Conventions in the future
will be hard pressed to do as well. Not just the mechanics but
the atmosphere too were worthy of the real thing.

But our purpose now is not to re-relate the things for
which Mr. Saunders was presented with the Gilliam and Ring-
tum Phi Awards last week. Rather, mostly for the benefit of
our readers who weren’t here for the Convention, we'd like
to make a couple of observations—not without pride—not
about the managers but about the managed: the delegates on
the floor.

First off, there seems to be at least a little truth behind the

stories of committees for certain hopefuls spending staggering |
sums trying to “buy” and “influence” delegate vores—phony |

telegrams-of-instruction, tantalizing and probably equally fake
summer-job-offers, and the like. But none of it worked, Not
at all.

And—though we don’t want to sound like a father patting
his little boy on the head—we think it’s pertinent to mention
that all the Highest Authorities on the Hill and in the Lex-
ington police station were pleasantly astonished at the decorum
(if not exactly dignity) maintained in every instance all week-
end long by the whole student body.

“
With bated breath

We await with some sense of relief but not-too-high expecta-
tions the imminent proposals of the Deferred Rush Committee
of the IFC concerning rules for 1969-70 rush, These proposals
must be submitted to the faculty no later than the first of
November next year, which means the eighteen fraternities
will have about six weeks for criticism and amendments after
school starts. Aside from the fact that the Committee is grant-
ing its constituents precious little time to consider the plans for
no less than the most massive adjustment to be required of
this University’s eighteen elite, there are a few bits of off-the-
record information we have learned, about which we are not
pleased.

As far as freshman-upperclassman contact during the first
semester is concerned, the plans as they now stand allow very
little, even on the weekends, and that which is permitted is

limited and casual. This will, we fear, create a division of classes |

severely injurious to the cohesive quality of Washington and
Lee’s student body and will effectively prohibit mature guid
ance, advice, understanding and friendship the new collegians
demand and need.

One of the more disturbing aspects of the proposals is
that in the Committee's thinking, we have heard, it was deemed
best not to make them so workable as to become palatable. In
this way the faculty would surely see the error of its ways and
allow the system to return to pledging as it now exists, We
sincerely hope we have heard wrong, but hasten to interject
our additional hopes that the proposals will be forthcoming
before this semester is finished and that the fraternity com-
munity will give itself ample time for thinking about some re
finements to make in the less than ample time it has to do so.

From our past

the lower social
unrest

If we transcend
strata in which
reached a_ fever
pitch we still find
dire problems in
interracial rela-
tionships. Take for
example Matt
Drayton, the fight-
ing liberal editor
of a large and in-
fluential San Fran-
cisco newspaper.
Having been an
outspoken advocate
of racial equality,
he finds his pholosophy severely tested
when his innocent daughter Joey falls
in love with a Negro during a nine-
day romantic whirl in Hawaii.

And not just any Negro, but a
physician—John Prentice—who was
graduated in the top of his class from
Johns Hopkins, went on to make an
outstanding record at Columbia
Medical School, and finally found
himself a high-ranking official of the
World Health Organization; at 36 he
seems to be filling the vacant shoes
of Tom Dooley and Albert Schweitz-

racial has

er. Dr. Prentice’s character and
medical achievements leave _ little
doubt that any hesitancy Drayton

might have regarding the proposed
marriage would be based primarily
on racial considerations.

Futhermore, Dr. Prentice _ insists
upon Drayton's full consent before he
will go on with the marriage; to
complicate the situation even more
the crucial endorsement is necessary
the very day Drayton discovers the
affair, for the next day Prentice and
Joey will fly to Geneva for the young
doctor's next assignment.

This sets the stage for a wrestling
match between Drayton and his con-
science—suddenly he must apply his
liberal philosophy to a rather sticky
situation. As seconds his wife, Chris-
tina, and a long-time family friend,
Monsignor Ryan, make no_ bones
about supporting his conscience while
the maid, Tillie, takes the opposing
side and swings her full weight be-
hind an original form of black power.

Through a twist of fate Mr. and

 

 

A glib review of our
new avant-garde flick

Mrs. Prentice decide to visit their
son in San Francisco before he goes
to Geneva; their initial shock at meet-
ing his fiancee equals that of the
Drayton's. Indeed when the two fath-
ers recover from their original stupe-
faction and have a conversation it
‘becomes apparent that their opinions
of the proposed marriage coincide,
almost too exactly for coincidence.
When the young Prentice has it
out with his father it becomes ap-
parent that more is at issue than mis-
cegenation; rather the question be-
comes one of the mutual obligations

of parent to child—what is owed to

parents after they have devoted years
of toil to give their children the
best opportunities. The young doctor's
response to this problem fails to
resemble a rebellious teenager and he
is quite provocative in his criticism
of his father’s attitude. He also sees
in his father a failure to meet the
responsibility of racial equality as he
is doomed to look down upon him-
self.

It is finally Drayton, however, who
attempts to draw meaningful con-
clusions from the whole affair in his
final pronouncements before dinner;
whether the issues are resolved re-
mains a moot point, and one perhaps
is left with a false sense of well-
being.

The lines may be drawn too boldly
in “Guess Who's Coming to Dinner”
—hyperbole is the reigning form and
the characters are extreme. Further-
more, as violent racial demonstrations
will probably be ubiquitous this sum-
mer, one is tempted to dismiss this
story as mere fairy tale. Nevertheless,
vital questions are examined as to
the depth of philosophical convictions
among the outspoken, the duty of
parents to their progeny and the
Negro’s prejudice against himself.

Spencer Tracy as Drayton turns in
a fine performance in his last screen
role; Sidney Poitier as the dynamic
doctor and Katherine Hepburn as
Christine Drayton are both unusually
tasteful in their portrayals. Katherine
Houghton is a bit too much as the
gushy, naive free-thinker Joey; her
inadequacies are more than over-
balanced by the pleasing jobs done by
Cecil Kellaway as the Monsignor and
Isabel Sanford as Tillie.

New apartments are not being con-

content with paying such a low rent,
despite the deplorable condition, As
was made blatantly obvious by last
week's article, the married couples are
far from “content,” moreover they
are disgusted with the existing situa-
tion. Several members of the ad-

He said that the apartments would
burn rapidly if they were set on fire,
but so would any wooden building

fire standards of the state and are
thus legally safe; he added, however,
that every time a fire alarm sounds,

he prays that it isn't for Hillside

Concerning the problem with

spiders and mice, Brady said they
lived in the apartments because of
the warmth. A private exterminator
is used to control these insects and
rodents when the residents request
help. He said the electrical wiring
problem would be solved soon, as
the possibility of re-wiring the units
is now being actively considered.

ties and repairs. He believed that new

Steve Saunders’ career at Wash-
ton and Lee has left in its wake a
whole host of new campus organiza
tions that mark by their diversity the
diversity of their creator, Steve's new-
est creation is the Lewis Carroli
Croquet and Cricket Society, which
is based on that immortal scene from
“Alice in Wonderland” in which the
Queen of Hearts plays croquet using
hedgehogs for balls and flamingos for
mallets.

Steve's creations aside, the winner
of the 1968 Gilliam Award has made
valuable contributions to a variety of
campus organizations, Steve directed
the very successful Mock Convention.
He is well remembered for his ex-
tensive use of the gavel at periodic
intervals and his trenchant comments
(“Will the gentleman from New York
please come to the point.”).

Steve's career in public activities
began at an early age when in 1961
he was the youngest government
official in the nation as the head
of the Nassau County Civil War
Centennial Commission,

Steve's other creations at Washing-
ton and Lee are the Freeport Tuna
Club (dedicated to the proposition
“That all men are basically fish") and
the John W. Davis Society. The form-
er is composed of the members of
Steve's dormitory section while the
latter is composed of notable campus
losers

However, Steve's success is quite
evident as his record in campus publi-
cations indicates, Steve was editor of
the Ring-tum Phi in his junior year
and directed the Southern Collegian
in his senior year. The Southern Col-
legian was almost ready to collapse
after 97 years of publication when
Saunders took over and published four
humorous issues this year that re-
flected the “Playboy” approach to
magazine design

Steve is a member of two national
honorary fraternities—Sigma Delta
Chi for Journalism and Pi Sigma
Alpha for political science. Steve was
also selected for “Who's Who in
American Colleges and Universities.”

While at Washington and Lee Steve
has received the Society of the Cin-
cinnati Award for a paper on Zach
ariah Johnston, a local Revolutionary
War patriot

 

 

 

 

Gilliam award winner
isn’t one of few interests

Next year Steve's interest in history
will be continued as he assumes a
post as master in history at the
Lawrenceville School, a private school
in New Jersey.

In high school Steve was an active
member of the Key Club and served
as Governor of New York State Key
Clubs and as Chairman of the Inter-
national Key Club Governors Con-
ference. Steve's interest in the Key
Club continues even today as he makes
frequent speaking trips to places as
far away as Alabama.

Steve also contributed much of his
time in high school to worthwhile
charities as he served in the capacity
of the New York State Youth Chair-
man for the March of Dimes and
the American Cancer Society.

Steve's one foray into athletics was
as manager for the varsity baseball
team.

Those of us who have come to
know Steve by working and being with
him over the years are of the opinion
that the student body will miss him
and will be hard-pressed to find as
capable an administrator, as warm a
personality, and as amusing a wit.

son lending a valuable hand in the
preparation for each match. During
games he would supervise offensive
substitutions and co-ordinate the
extra-man offense. Coach Szlasa com-
mented that Carroll gave up a tre-
mendous amount of time every day
and that without him there probably
would not have been a lacrosse team
this year.

Carroll also served another function
that probably was the most important
though completely overlooked by
everyone except Coach Szlasa: he
provided a link between the players
and the new coach. So often in a
coach’s freshman year there is a
communication problem merely be-
cause coach and players aren't used
to each other. Carroll served the pur-
pose of linking coach and player and
establishing a rapport that is so vital
to success. Carroll was close to both
coach and player. Coach Szlasa said:
“Carroll was invaluable in getting
me through my first year in coaching.”

Carroll has already passed his Vir-
ginia Bar Exam and plans to practice
law in Virginia. Coach Szlasa ex-
pressed the desire to have Carroll
do some lacrosse scouting.

Carroll will be going in the Army
in the summer but it is likely that
he will return to this area when he
finishes his duty. He is married to
the former Mary Stone Copenhaver
of Roanoke. Coach Szlasa expressed
the desire to have Carroll back in any
capacity for he posses a wonderful
talent for lacrosse playing and coach-
ing. Everyone at W&L owes Carroll
a thanks for seven years of dedica-
tion to lacrosse.

Some of the seniors on this year's
team deserve mention are Terry Grif-
fin who as captain gave a great
amount of time and desire and no
one could have asked more of a
captain; Hugh Baugher; Bob Frost;
Ralph Schenkel; Chip Chew; Tom
Pittman; Harold Stowe who is steady,

reliable and as dependable as you
could want a defenseman; Holmes
Raker; and last but not least young

Scott Farrar who is leaving Lexing-
ton to attend Episcopal School in
Alexandria (Scott was the manager)

Though the Generals are losing a
ereat bunch of players Coach Szlasa
is Optimistic about next season. Frosh
standouts Whit Morrill and Bill
Brumback will be back as will be
Joe Wich, Charlie Stewart, Jay Meri-
weather, and a host of others to
provide a very sound basis for next

U.N.C., Western Maryland, Washing-
ton College, and Fairleigh-Dickison
who is in the same league as Mary-
land, Johns Hopkins, and Navy). To-
morrow afternoon is an opportunity
to thank some of these people by
giving them some support in the sea-
son's last contest. Surely Carroll
Klinglehoffer deserves a standing ova-
tion for all his service to lacrosse and
Washington and Lee.

College Athletic Conference

(Continued from Page 3)

Coach Joe Lyles took third place in
the tourney, rebounding from a loss
Friday to take two games Saturday.
The Generals lost a squeaker Friday,
1-0, to Southwestern. Bill Rassmussen,
senior from Richmond, struck out ten
and, according to Coach Lyles, “pitch-
ed well enough to win.”

Before the game with Sewanee
Saturday morning, Coach Lyles told
his team “Sewanee is the key game;

if we can beat them, then take South-
western in a re-match.” He also called
for balance between defense and
offense, saying the team would need
“back-to-back clutch hits.”

Following this, Tom Mitchell won
his fifth game of the season, beating
Sewanee 2-1. Then Saturday after-
noon at VMI the Generals, with left-
hander John Botcheller on the mound,
edged Southwestern in a_ rematch,
4-3. The third place finish assured
Washington and Lee of the President's
Trophy.

In addition to the three consistent
pitchers, Coach Lyles singled out a
number of players as tournament
standouts. Among these were Steve
Kalista, who collected three hits and
was “outstanding” defensively. Lyles
praised catcher Jack Baizley, second-
baseman John Nolan, shortstop Gil
Fitzhugh and center-fielder Chris
Courseau for their defensive play and
Fitzhugh for his two “timely” hits
in the second Southwestern game.

Lyles’ strategy of walking poten-
tionally dangerous Sewanee and
Southwestern hitters also paid off on
four occasions,

Monday the baseball team elected
Tom Mitchell and Jim Wilson as
co-captains for next season. Mitchell
is co-captain this year.

Final IFC

meeting
(Continued from Page 1)

IFC set a basic guideline of the levels
of fines for rush week offenses. Pres-
ently many fines are levied at the
discretion of the Judicial Board which
usually attempts to base its decision
on the past precedents. Carter, IFC
president, said that the Judicial Board
would attempt to issue a set of
guidelines for rush week fines.

Huntley Johnson, chairman of the
Deferred Rush Committee and next
year’s Rush Chairman, said that there
would be a meeting of all the fra-
ternity presidents Wedensday at 6:45
in the dining hall to present the plan
| for deferred rush as well as the basic
outline of next fall's rush schedule.
It will be made public after next
| Monday,

Dean Atwood also mentioned that
the Board of Trustees is presently
| considering the proposed $600,000
| maintenance loan to about 17 of the
fraternities. He said so far seven of
the houses had indicated a favorable
response toward the loans if they
were offered by the trustees.

the students; they, however, should be
much safer.

John G. Snyder, Director of Uni-
versity Services, said that the num-
ber of students desiring to live in the
apartments has increased over the
years. However, the waiting list is
usually cleared by the beginning of
the summer; some people remove
themselves from consideration by
getting other housing in town.

Snyder also said that six faculty
members and one member of the ad-
ministration live in Davidson Park,
thus taking up valuable room which
could be used by students. The faculty
moved in when the student demand
was not so great; the apartments were
also used as inducements to late-com-
ing faculty members who needed
apartments,

Edward C. Atwood, Dean of Stu-
dents, was questioned about the fi-
nancial backing for new housing. He
said that rental fees would range
between $75 and $100 per month
for new apartments; he added that
it would be physically impossible to
do it for less. He also said that the
prospect for new housing looks dim,
as he believed the students to be

Frank Parsons, Director of Uni-

“unlikely in the long-range plans” to
build new apartments, especially at
Hillside Terrace. The city, which
leases the land to W&L, wants to re-
place the unsightly buildings with a

‘Shenandoah’ Fund Established |

In Memory Of Former Editor

A special fund to assist Washington
and Lee University’s literary maga-
zine, “Shenandoah,” has been estab-
lished with initial gifts of $4,500.

The fund was established through
a gift of $1,500 from Mrs, Myrtle
Watts Thomas of Birmingham, Ala.,
which was matched by the Coordinat-
ing Council of Literary Magazines of
Washington, D.C. The CCLM also
contributed another $1,500 outright.

Mrs. Thomas established — the
“Shenandoah Fund” in memory of
her late husband, Edward M. Hood,
Sr., a Washington and Lee alumnus.
Her son, Edward M. Hood, Jr., was
editor and a frequent contributor to
“Shenandoah” while an undergraduate
at Washington and Lee.

The fund will be used for editorial
assistance in putting out the quarterly
publication, to pay contributors to
the magazine and to finance a special
issue, said James Boatwright, associate
professor of English and “Shenan-
doah” editor.

‘Achievements’ Of The EC

Since this is the last Friday Ring-tum Phi of the current
school year, we feel as if we should review the record which
this year’s Executive Committee has “achieved.”

1. The EC named Lane Steinger to the chairmanship of
the Curriculum Committee in October. More than five months
later, the EC decided to replace Steinger, without his knowl-
edge, because of his failure to produce a report on the com-
mittee’s activities after a number of requests.

2. The EC voted to give the Student Bar Association $400
for the first semester to pay for law school subscriptions to the
Law Review. When the EC was asked to do this for the second
semester, it postponed action to see if it would be possible to
increase the student tax. Final action was taken by reallocating
30 cents per student of the student body head tax to the Law
Review.

3. The EC raised the fines for cold checks, but put off

a proposal made by Emory Waters which would strengthen | : \
| “Fred” as the last Troub play for

the Cold Check Committee. This proposal stated that the com-
mittee would pay immediately the merchant to cover any stu-
dent’s cold check, and then have the committee collect the
amount of the check plus the fine from the offender. The EC
postponed action on this recommendation but approved it
shortly afterward.

4. The EC gave the Library Committee permission to
spend the $280 of the Chitwood Memorial Fund on “best
sellers’ at its own discretion.

5. The EC defeated a motion that there be greater fresh-
man representation on the Library Committee and the Cold
Check Committee.

6. The EC discussed splitting itself into separate legislative
and judicial bodies. The arguments in favor of this were that
the splitting of roles would separate the powers and possibly
make the enforcement of the Honor System more effective.
It would also make the Honor System more independent of
politics and more respected by the students as a consequence.
The arguments against the measure were that no significant
need had been demonstrated (even though the EC was study-
ing the matter because of the difficulty it faced in allocating
its time when honor trials precluded legislative activity) and
that a split would tend to minimize the importance of both
sections.

7. The EC voted to schedule mid-terms tests in a manner
similar to final exams. But the faculty beat it to the punch
by abolishing mid-term grades for all students except freshmen.

8. The EC gave its support to the collection of freshman
dues for Fancy Dress Weekend.

9. The EC rejected membership in the Virginia Associa-
tion of Student Governments and then voted to join in time
to attend the state meeting to participate in the group’s elect-
ions. However, at VASG’s meeting last weekend, W&L was not
represented because the new president of the student body,
Jay Passavant, was not informed about it by former president
Richard Nash until two days before. By this time it was too
late to send any representative.

10. The EC voted to issue a statement of the Honor Sys-
tem to incoming freshmen around the first of May. The pur-
pose of this would be to make the freshmen aware of the
system long before freshman camp. This has not yet been
done, although the new EC is in the process of finishing it.

The record for the EC this year has not been impressive,
to say the least. This is not to say it has not done anything
constructive, but we feel that more should have been done by
a group which meets every week. Ever since the EC began last
spring with a proposal which would make living in the proposed
upperclass dormitories voluntary, it has been going downhill.

The EC got bogged down in investigations and had to
postpone many important things, which are still “being looked
into.” Committees which could have been strengthened by cer-
all the
dy namic changes in the university this year have come trom
the faculty. This is not the way it should be.

Miller Reveals Orig

By LAWRENCE MeCONNELL

Fonight and Saturday night at 8:30,
the curtain will go up on the re-
maining two performances of “Fred,”
the Troubadour Theater's last pro-
duction. The players, Don Baker as
Bob Hunter, Kristie Morris as Cheryl,
and Hugh Hill as Buffalo Bill, have
rehearsed for the Troubs’ last produc-
tion of the year since the beginning
of May.

This two-act play is singular be-
cause it is the first full-length pro-
duction to be performed here that
was written by a former W&L stu-
dent. The young playwright is Scott
Miller, who graduated from W&L
last year. Miller was a student in
Mr. Lee Kahn’s acting class last year
when he first became interested in
drama. Since then he has turned out
three short plays in less than a year’s
time, a surprising number for some-
one who had taken an acting course
out of curiosity.

Miller had been in collaboration
with Kahn since October over his
last script, “Fred.” After a discussion
in January, Kahn decided to produce

Simon's lyrics are as current and
meaningful as ever. In fact Paul
Simon seems to demonstrate greater
understanding of his subject in this
album. He is now a more mature
lyricist than the one who merely
adapted youthful feeling to paper
and song as in “He was my Broth-
er,” a song about freedom riders
written in 1963. His experience has
gone beyond a Columbia under-
graduate. From this type of song
he has developed as a discerning
critic and commentator of the
American scene, Not all of the
songs on this new album hit with
the same power. Some are raw
and straight; others are wistful and
dreamy. But they all present a pic-
ture of America. There is a lot to
be found here to answer questions
that are raised today about what
has become of the great American
way. If “The Graduate” was about
a lack or inability to communicate,
this is an attempt to bridge that
gap.

Barbecue Will Feature New C. A. C. Bell

By CHARLIE FRERET

On Wednesday, May 22, Washing-
ton and Lee athletes, managers and
coaches will gather at Camp Maxwel-
ton for the annual Spring Sports
Barbecue. As usual monogram sweat-
ers, certificates and awards will be
presented. However, one new feature
this year will be the Bell. This, of
course, is the C.A.C. bell, won by
General teams as they emerged as
overall conference champions, This
capped a truly successful year for the
Washington and Lee sports program.

Washington and Lee participated in
twelve intercollegiate sports and play-
ed a total of 130 athletic contests.
The overall record of 72 victories,
57 losses, and one tie gave the Gen-
erals a winning percentage of .554.,
Of the 12 teams, six had winning
records and all displayed the team
spirit that made the respective coaches
proud to be associated with their
boys. While the leadership and abili-
ties of the seniors will be missed, the
nucleus of all the teams was largely
juniors and sophomores, which should
indicate even better things next year.

Football

The football team had captains
Phil Thompson and Rudd Smith to
lead the team back to a winning
record. The Generals finished with a
5-4 record, the state small college
championship and second place finish
in the C.A.C. While the shoes of
quarterback Andy Bloom will prove
the biggest to fill, next year’s captains
Scott MacKenzie and John Wolf will
lead an intact defensive team that
shut out three opponents this year.

With six home games and all-C.A.C.
selections John Wolf, Scott Mac-
Kenzie, John Harris and Charlie
Freret back, 1968 should be a good
year on the gridiron.

Soccer

The soccer team once again posted
a winning record while also winning
the state championship. Captains
Charlie Harrold and Allen Craig led
their team to a 7-3 record. With All-
Stater Scott Fechnay and Tom Mit-
chell as captains-elect for next year,
the soccer team should be strong
enough to successfully defend its
championship.

Cross-Country

While the cross-country team finish-
ed with a 3-5 record, many fine run-
ners return next year. Captain Corbet
Bryant and Bob Stack led this year’s
team to a second place in the C.A.C.
Next year’s captains are Ralph Pearcy
and Harry Zeliff.

Basketball

This year’s basketball team record-
ed a 19-6 record under captains Jody
Kline and Rob Bauer. And they won
the conference championship for the
second year in a row. Led by the
talented sophomore M-squad of Mel
Cartwright, Mal Wesselink, and Mike
Neer, the Generals should be even
better next year as only Kline will be
gone. Neer and John Carrere were
all-C.A.C. choices, and Rob Bauer
will captain next year’s team.

Rifle

The rifle team led by captain
Steve Pennil emerged with a 3-4
record. While riflle does not attract
a large following, the boys are no
less dedicated. Next year’s captains

The wrestling team garnered a 3-8

these two gone next year, and with

captains, they should improve. A sec-
ond place in the C.A.C. showed the
fine determination of this squad to
overcome other setbacks.

Baseball

Bill Rasmussen and Tom Mitchell

record. Instrumental in bringing the
President’s Bell, for overall supremacy
of the C.A.C., to Lexington, was the
baseball team’s unexpected — third
place finish in the C.A.C. Tourna-
ment. Tom Mitchell and Jim Wilson
led the team throughout the season,
and capped their fine years by mak-
ing the C.A.C. tournament team.

General Stickmen Close Year
With 17-4 Defeat Against UVa

By THUNDER THORNTON

Spectators at Wilson Field nearly
witnessed an upset Wednesday, as the
Wahoos of U.Va. did not come on
until the final moments of the second
period to move away to their 17-4
win over the Generals. Playing under
bright skies, the home forces jumped
out to a 2-1 lead to momentarily
cheer the vociferous crowd, but Vir-
ginia tied it before the end of the

quarter.

As the half was closing, the visi-
tors fired in five quick goals to move

Croquet Finalists

In Golden Mallet Tournament

Approximately sixty spectators
viewed the skilled exhibition of twelve
members of the Lewis Carroll Croquet
and Cricket Society (LCC&CS) this
past Sunday in the initial elimination
round of “The Golden Mallet Tourna-
ment.” The finals of this croquet
extravaganza will be held this Sun-
day, May 19, at 2:00 p.m. on the
front lawn of Washington Hall and
will be co-sponsored by the LCC&CS
and the Mock Convention Secretariat.
James Harry Lowe, Grand Master of
the Society and Secretary of the
Convention, explained the participa-
tion of the Secretariat: “Croquet is
a dignified, slow-moving game, and
winning is not as important as playing
well. It is thus the most natural
game for Republicans.”

Last Sunday's round was high-light-
ed by the appearance of David B.

easy on them. He talks of re-

It scared me next. This album hits
at the gut. Paul Simon and Art
Garfunkel are in the class of today’s
artists who do just that. Like Norman
Mailer, they paint a harsh picture of
this country that they love and the
people in it. John Steinbeck traveled
with Charlie. He pointed out a lot of
beautiful things in this country that
we no longer see. But he didn't
represent it as it really was because
he didn’t show us the frightening
people, those who were pretty when
they were young but have become
ugly with age. This is a land of
man’s dreams. Here we are given a
glimpse of what has become of some
recent dreams.

In “The Graduate,” Elaine's mother
told her it was too late for her to
follow her dream and run off with
Benjamin. “Not too late for me,”
was the answer. There are a lot of
older people in the country who miss-

IFC Deferred Rush Committee

In preparing our proposal for de-
ferred rush, we have attempted to
create a plan that
will be workable
and practical for
all concerned part-
ies — a plan that
answered all the
faculty's past ob-
jections and that
was in the best
interest of both
freshmen and the
fraternity system
of Washington and
Lee

   

Huntley Johnson

As an alternative to the limited
contact which we have proposed there
is the possibility of an unlimted con-
tact system for de-
ferred rush. After
considering these
two possibilities at
length, we have
chosen to limit
contact during the
first semester for
the folowing rea-
sons:

(1) If there is
too much pressure
on the freshmen in
one week of in-
tensified rush, try to imagine the pres-
sures that whole semester of intensi-
fied (unlimited contact) rush would
place on freshmen (as well as fra-
ternity men).

 

Bruce Downing

(2) By conducting rush in a casual,
relaxed manner over a long period
of time it is hoped that the freshmen
will better be able to choose the
house in which they will best fit and
be most happy.

(3) If unlimited contact were al-
lowed, it would completely wreck
the fraternity system financially.
Competition for freshmen’s interest
would cause fraternities to at first
try hiring the best (and most ex-
pensive) live entertainment for their
house. This desire to attract rushees
might even lead to the fraternity’s
paying for meals and drinks for the
freshmen.

(4) Any rules that might be estab- |
lished with regard to weekend con-
tact would be virtually unenforceable.

(5) An unlimited amount of contact
would create an inequality among the
fraternities due to the scattered loca-
tions of the houses. It is very doubt-
ful that the houses on Nelson and
Main Streets would even see a frac-
tion of the students that would gather
at the much more conveniently locat-
ed Red Square Houses.

EC recommends relaxing
of liquor and female rules
in upperclass dormitories

In accordance with the recent mo-
tion passed by the Student Affairs
Commitiee, the EC strongly recom
mends that the administration take
immediate action to construct com
fortable lounges for the upperclass
men and Law students living in Baker
and Davis dormitories

This motion was passed by the Stu
dent Affairs Committee in light of the
fact that the new Student Union will
not be completed for another year
and that fraternity upperclassmen
and Law students living in University

 

housing are presently without an ade
quate facility in which to entertain
female guests

lt will be understood that girls and |

liquor will be permitted in these
lounges only with resident upper: |
classmen and Law students. The EC

has realized the needs of these men
for the coming year and urges that
econsiruction of the proposed lounges
take place over summer Vacation

The Lee Associates concept was
established in 1967 by the Board of
Trustees as a means of providing
special honor and involvement for
the University’s “most devoted and
most generous” friends and potential
friends. Initially, invitations to join
Associates were sent to those
who previously had contributed gen-
erously to the University.

Contributions to W&L by the 82

about $43,000 in each of the three
years prior to the inauguration of
the Associates program. About $100,-

been realized through the inducement
of membership in the Associates.

Mr. Hotchkiss voiced pleasure at

Number 55

No contact or summer rush
basis of deferred rush plan

By REEVE KELSEY
News Editor

In a meeting last Wednesday night
Huntley Johnson, chairman of the
IFC’s Deferred Rush Committee, pre-
sented the tentative plan for the de-
ferred rush that the faculty has re-
quested for the 1969-1970 school
year. The plan features a long series
of open houses beginning in October
and a tightly controlled no-contact
provision.

The open houses would begin on
the first Monday in October and last
until the last Thursday before exams.
The open houses would be only
Monday through Thursday. After
lunch each Monday the rushee would
sign up in the Student Union build-
ing for up to two open houses, At
6:30 he would be picked up at the
Student Union building. Only those
houses that now have cars during
open houses would be allowed them
next year.

The rushees must be returned by
7:30. The fines for lateness would
be $10 for every five minutes of late-
ness up to 25 minutes, when the
case would be considered by the
Judicial Board. A rushee would be
unable to return to a given house
until after the seventh week of rush.
There would be no alcoholic bever-
ages served at the open houses.

Each fraternity would have only
one open house a week; there would
be no rushing on Friday nights. This
will correspond to the one night a
week that pledges now eat at the
houses.

The final formal rush week would
be the first week of the second
semester running from Monday to
Thursday with a last day of open
houses on Monday night and formal
rush dates beginning Tuesday.

The contact rules have been made
especially stringent. The tentative
article concerning contact _ states:
“There will be no contact between
fraternity members and perspective
rushees (i.e. freshmen and non-fra-
ternity transfer students) except when
specified. Rushees may at no time
visit lodgings of an upperclassmen
who is a fraternity member with the
exception of a dorm counselor in the
dorms.”

Other rules concerning contact also
prohibit contact during vacations—
Thanksgiving and Christmas. Fresh-
men will also be prohibited from rid-
ing in any car belonging to or con-
taining a fraternity member. This in-
cludes the outlawing of summer rush
and rush publications.

The penalties for breaking the con- |
tact rules are $250 for the first of-|
fense, $500 for the second offense, |
and suspension of rushing privileges’

 

for the third offense. A freshman will
lose his rush privileges for a semester
if he breaks the contact rules. These
restrictions do not extend to the co-op,
the classrooms, and the athletic fields.

Huntley Johnson said that his com-
mittee had attempted to choose a
middle road between a plan which was
too specific to prevent a flexible
adaptation to the demands of the
moment, or a plan too vague to be
effective. Many of the house presi-
dents were concerned about the
vagueness of many of the regulations
when faced with the stiffness of the
fines.

Johnson explained the reasoning
behind his committee’s decision for
the no-contact rules: he stated this
would hurt many of the houses that
were removed from campus, as fresh-
men would tend to congregate at the
houses within walking distance; any
weekend contact rules would be virtu-

 

ally unenforceable and could easily
result in band escalation as well as
increased costs to provide liquor and
meals for freshmen at a time when
the fraternities will have to closely
watch their finances.

Johnson also noted that this would
also result in extreme social pressure
for an extended period of time on
both the fraternities and the fresh-
men. For these reasons the Deferred
Rush Committee decided it would ulti-
mately be in the best interests of the
fraternities to invoke a stringent no-
contact regulation, for the limited
weekend rushing or contact would be
too expensive, and that open-contact
would be patently unfair to many of
the houses.

The committee will put the rough
outline of the plan into a final version
and submit it to both the faculty and
the IFC next September for official
approval.

 

Maintenance fund required
of borrowing fraternities

The Board of Trustees has voted
to require fraternities that borrow
money from the University for house
improvements to establish individual
maintenance funds to help take care
of upkeep over the 25-year loan-re-
payment period.

The maintenance fund program re-
quires each borrowing fraternity to
set aside a sum, equal to three per
cent of the valuation of the house
building, to be drawn upon as need-
ed. The measure was passed at the
Trustees’ meeting Saturday.

The University has had a practice,
which the Trustees said they plan to
continue, of offering remodelling-
loans to chapters at four per cent
interest. The loans are repayable over
25 years. By voting to continue the
loan-making practice, the Trustees
appear to have implicitly accepted
that fraternities are here to stay, at
least for 25 years.

The maintenance funds, which will
be supervised by the University but
which can be drawn upon only by
the chapters, would hopefully en-
courage chapters to keep their houses
in shape all the time, rather than
putting them in shape with a massive
University loan every quarter-cen-
tury and then doing nothing until it
is necessary to borrow another vast
sum.

The University will also make
twice-yearly inspection visits to each
borrowing fraternity chapter, to sug-
gest needed repairs. The University

 

would not be able to require any
such repairs to be made, not even
from the University-supervised maint-
enance fund.

It was pointed out that no house
is required to borrow from the Uni-
versity, but that those which do
choose to borrow in the future will
be required to establish the three
per cent funds. No non-borrowing
chapters would be required to set up
the funds,

The University loans, which are
available for reasonable structural
improvements and repairs to houses,
are obtained by application directly
to the Board of Trustees. The Board
passes on each loan application in-
dividually, taking into consideration
the chapter's willingness and ability
to repay.

By making loans at four per cent,
when the same money could be
earning more by investing it in securi-
ties, the University is considered to
be subsidizing fraternities to the ex-
tent of the difference between four
per cent and the going commercial

Tuesday, May 21, 1968

 

A very good year

It has been customary for retiring editors to write a swan-song

“review of the year” in the last
to break with tradition?

It has been a full year and,

new president whose vigor, enthusiasm and ability need no
further endorsement from us. { The faculty’s monthly legisla-
tive meetings have suddenly and happily become occasions
for purposeful change wherever, it seems, change is needed.

{ Extracurricular programs—from evening lectures to ODK
Tap Day to Contact to the Mock Convention to all the less-
spectacular but no-less-significant regular activities—were un-
precedented in their own quality as well as in the interest they
stimulated. { The New Left, small but not lazy, emerged into
respectability here this year and conducted its affairs with a
degree of responsibility that was at first surprising to many.

* The development program came into its own; and if its
undertakings are not yet highly visible, the future of Wash-
ington and Lee has already been, and will continue to be,
markedly influenced and immeasurably benefited by them. 4
While the Inter-Fraternity Council was not exactly characteriz-
ed by dynamism, fraternities individually showed themselves
to be capable of overcoming, through their own positive
action and through a new aversion to negative action, the ugly
image they gave themselves last year. { And while the Executive
Committee was similarly less-than-energetic, legislatively, stu-
dent affairs seem to have been taken care of in other ways, and
at least as successfully as an energetic EC might have done.

A great many questions were answered, solutions to others
are actively being sought and arrived at, and—just as import-
antly—new, pertinent questions are being asked. It has been
a full year and, yes, a good one.

It is not possible for the retiring editor to leave this news-
paper and this University without trying, however inade-
quately, to indicate his indebtedness to the staff members who
worked under him. Thirty-five years ago, another retiring
Ring-tum Phi editor wrote: “If our readers think there has been
anything good in the paper this year, they can credit the

staff.” So they can now. We

manding, usually impatiently, perfection from the staff. It
gave close to it. In this regard, the work of the News Editor,
Bill Wilkerson, and the Editorial-Page Editor, Joe Wilson,
deserves particular mention and deepest thanks. They and the
staff under them have served the Ring-tum Phi well this year—
and have done it in a way that made us look forward to the
first of each week for the pleasure of their company. We can-
not forget any of it—or any of them.

By DEE POSED

Once again, as spring rolls by and
exams rush toward us, that grand
old institution, the Moose Lodge
Carnival, is under way on the Goshen
road, This year, Young's Amusements,
whose slogan ominously enough is
“Young for the young,” promises to
present attractions which will excite
people of all ages.

For example, in addition to the
regular concessions and corny games,
there are several “thrill rides.” There
is alo an animal display and a
new attraction, a mandrill: a large
baboon which according to Lee Pruitt,
manager of Young's, “changes color
according to its mood,” The mandrill
is billed as the “Creature of the
Cameroons,” and was purchased for |
$1,000. “Life” carried an article on |
“the Creature” in 1963,

This reporter was fortunate enough
to meet and interview two charming
ladies who are featured in one of

 

the shows. Miss “Candy Kisses,” age
24, and Miss “Candy Delight,” age)
22, are sisters from New Orleans
who are known as the “Candy Twins.”

 

They have been performing together
for five years.

Both Miss Kisses, whose measure-
ments are 40-25-38, and Miss Delight
(37-23-38) perform in night clubs dur-
ing the winter season, They have been |
featured at the Stork Club, the Club)
Capri, and the Club Galore.

Come the summer season, “the)
Candy Twins” join carnivals and play
mostly county and state fairs, They |
usually play college towns and mili-
tary bases two or three times a year,
Both ladies agree that they enjoy |
performing in college towns because
“most college boys are gentlemen.”

A reply

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

After reading the two articles by
Reed Byrum about student housing,
we would like to speak in defense
of Hillside Terrace.

It is true that Hillside was con-
structed in 1946 as “temporary” bar-
racks for veterans returning to W&L
and that the apartments here have
their limitations; however, to say that
they have “decayed into a rodent-
infested, insect-ridden, rotten health
and safety hazard” is totally untrue
and abhorrent to us. Since we were
not interviewed, we would like to
answer the questions put to several
of our neighbors.

A challenge

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
Some recent comments in the
Ring-tum Phi regarding the recruit-

ment of students from minority groups |

and low-income backgrounds, and re-
garding the heterogeneity of the stu-
dent body generally, fail to note an
important alternative for dealing with
the problem. Possibly the most effect-
ive recruiting of new students can
be done by present students them-
selves.

The resources of the Admissions
Office are quite limited and its opera-
tions necessarily confined to rather
formal and official contacts for the
most part. Members of our student
body, on the other hand, are widely
scattered over the country during
summer and other vacations and are
often in touch with potential stu-
dents of just the sort of background
and interests that our admissions office
can not reach. The informal contacts
with Washington and Lee, established
through present students, can be of
great value to the admissions pro-
gram in supplementing the current
effort.

The quality of her students is prob-
ably a university's most important
asset. Those men who wish to attend
Washington and Lee can be sure of
a careful consideration of their appli-
cations and, if present standards can
be maintained, the financial support
from the University which they and
their families cannot provide. To reach
the men we need and want is greatly
important. Washington and Lee stu-
dents can make a vital contribution
to our efforts to do so,

Those to whom Washington and
Lee seems not what it ought to be
do not always appreciate that they
bear a responsibility for making their
University what they wish it to be.
Washington and Lee is clearly in the
process of significant change. The
direction which that change will take
hangs greatly on the devotion, de-
termination, and hard work of all of
us, not only the faculty and ad-
ministration,

By RICHARD NASH
Student Body President

   

After reading the editorial by
“N.S.K.” in last Friday’s Ring-tum
Phi, I made the |
comment that I | wi
might write an

answer to it in de-
fense of this year’s
Executive Commit-
tee. A person over-
hearing me re-
marked, “Why do —
that? Everyone
knows it’s written
by an uninformed
person. No one
will pay any at-

Richard Nash

tention to it anyway.”

I had to agree that that was

probably true, But unfortunately “un-
informed...” people somehow man-
age to get into print around here,
and the risk is run that someone will
believe them. Therefore, 1 am writing
the following in order to point out the
several errors in “N.S.K.’s” editorial,
and also to point out some of the
things this year’s E.C, has done which
“N.S.K.” failed to mention.
@ “N.S.K.’s” first point (appearing
first no doubt because it involved his
fraternity brother) was that we fired
the head of the Curriculum Commit-
tee without his knowledge and ap-
pointed a new chairman.

First of all, it was not done with-
out his knowledge. He was asked to
appear for four weeks straight and
also told he might be removed. He
never appeared, and when he was
removed, a letter was sent to him at
his fraternity house informing him
of the action.

It might also be mentioned here
that the new chairman has accomp-
lished about five times as much in
two months as the old one did in
five.

@ It is true that we allocated $400
to the S.B.A. for the first semester
to help them in the publication of
the Law Review. However, unlike
“N.S.K.” states, we did not postpone
action in giving them funds for the
second semester. In fact, the S.B.A.
neither asked for nor expected funds
during the second semester. What we
did do, however, was reallocate the
student body head tax so the S$.B.A.
would receive additional funds in the
future.

@ We did revise the Cold Check fine
and the Cold Check Committee's
operations, What was wrong with that,
“N.S.K."?

@ We did give the Library Commit-

tee the permission to choose the books
for the Chitwood Memorial Fund.

@ “N.S.K.” is correct in saying that
the E.C, defeated a motion to in-
crease freshman representation on the
Library and Cold Check Committees.
What “N.S.K.” failed to report (may-
be he didn’t know) was that we later
reversed that and appointed more
freshmen than ever before to those
committees.

@ It is true that we chose not to
divide the E.C. into a judicial and
legislative branch.

@ “N.S.K.” claims that we suggested
that a schedule of mid-term exams
be set up, but that “the faculty beat
us to the punch” by abolishing mid-
semester grades.

Well, I wasn’t aware that we were
competing with the faculty for ac-
complishments. But that is not the
point. The point is that the sug-
gestion was only one of three that
we made to the faculty.

Another was that there be no mid-
semester grades, and the other was
that if there were, that there be a
note on the grades that they were
only temporary.

@ It is true that we supported the
collection of freshman dues for Fancy
Dress Weekend. I might remind
“N.S.K.” that had the dues not been

Negro is taboo—
especially by the adult generation.

On the other hand, everyone had

Student Curriculum Committee

 

By SWEDE HENBERG

While there may be a consensus
among both students and faculty that
some sort of cur-
riculum = changes
are needed for
Washington and
Lee, the problem of
offering alternatives
is by no means a
simple one. To
that end both the
faculty and the
Executive Commit-
tee have created
their respective
Curriculum Com-
mittees. Personally, | feel every stu-
dent should be actively concerned with
whatever issues are discussed by either
the faculty or the student committee.
Since I also realize how impossible
active participation on the part of
every student is (both because of the
numbers involved and apathy), | wish
to offer the first in a series of re-
ports—continuing into next year—
which will hopefully keep the student
body abreast of the ideas and inova-
tions that might soon become a part
of the curriculum.

First of all, I should like to em-
phasize that the main goal of the
Student Curriculum Committee is to
offer suggestions which will improve
the quality of Washington and Lee
as an educational institution, We are
not a mere grievance commitiee. 1
don't feel it within our prerogative to
offer criticism of, say, individual pro-
| fessors. While poor teaching may be
inexcusable, that problem is best dealt
with inside the various departments,
| can only say that the ill-feeling
bred by a pronouncement of our com-
mittee against any single professor
would serve merely to discredit any
other suggestions that might be offer-
ed

Probably the mere fact that a mis-
conception of our function such as
the above exists at all would suggest
there has been a complete lag in
communication between the students
and the Curriculum Commitiee. Hope-
fully, this lag can be partially re
medied by these articles. Going a

 

Swede Henberg

 

Vanguard of change

step further, however, | would like to
urge that any student who has an
idea which he feels is constructive to
our aims either talk to me personally
or to a member of the committee.
While we have already done extensive
brain-storming, there may well be
certain areas we have overlooked. Any
legitimate proposal deserves consid-
eration, and therefore | would sin-
cerely appreciate suggestions of all
sorts,

As concerns specific areas now
under study, the first of these falls
under the general heading of dis-
tribution requirements. The  over-
| whelming consensus of this year's
; committee calls for a general lib-
eralization of current requirements.
This goal might be accomplished by
allowing students greater freedom
with the present categories, For
instance instead of having to take
six hours of philosophy, a student
might be allowed to take three hours
of philosophy and three hours of
religion, At least in the upper class
levels there are courses which lend
themselves to one semester's presenta-
tion, and there seems to be no reason
why students should be required to
take six hours of non-linked courses
in one department jusi to fulfill a
distribution requirement.

Along similar lines, this argument
might well be applied to freshman
sciences as well as to later distribu.
tion such as economics or fine arts.
As an example a student might be
allowed to take geology first semester
and biology second semester. This
would necessitate teaching introduct-
ory biology both semesiers, but that
does not seem like an insurmountable
barrier to such a program,

Another unaniamous suggestion
made by this year’s committee is to
encourage departments to offer more
comprehensive examinations to enter-
ing freshman, which might relieve
them entirely of certain requirements,
For instance, if a student passes the
math examination offered by the
school, he must now take Math 11
Instead he might be relieved of three
hours of math distribution require-

collected there would have been no
cocktail party that weekend,
@ Yes, we did reject membership in
V.A.S.G, at first and decided to join
later. This was because we (wisely,
we felt) waited to find out more about
the organization before “leaping in.”
It is true that I only informed Mr.
Passavant about the V.A.S.G. con-
ference two days before it was to
take place. What “N.S.K.” didn’t
mention was that I informed him of
it less than five minutes after 1 my-
self was informed of it.
@ We also voted to send the fresh-
men a pamphlet on the Honor System
over the summer in order to make
them more knoledgeable about it.

“N.S.K.,” however, feels we have
not done this yet. This is untrue. The
motion passed on April 9, 1968, and
the pamphlets are to be sent this
month with a letter from next year's

Fraternities face dectsion
on future Negro members

The significance of the above situa-
tions at Washington and Lee is easily
evident. Drawing a good number of
its student body from areas of tradi-
tional racial division, the University
community includes many with acute
sensitivity to the Negro issue. Also,
the fraternity system here has for
the past couple of years been under
careful scrutiny by the faculty and
administration, a few constructive
changes having already been sug-
gested.

Such university concern must be
expected with a fraternity system in-
cluding consistently 80 per cent of
the student body. The fraternity sys-
tem is a half of the overall Uni-
versity community.

Washington and Lee has been
slow to perceive the enormous im-
port of the question. The issue is
whether an individual, no matter what
his skin color or other physical char-
acteristics, will be accorded all the
rights and privileges of a human being.

It is unfortunate to even live in a
generation where such an issue is
doubted, but it is unquestionably pres-
ent. Of course, progress has been
made; but any conviction today, short
of full acceptance of Negro equality
in all things, is dangerously volatile
and nearly unaccepatble.

Fraternities, | believe, are one of
the most beneficial Opportunities in
college life. However, if they do not
accept and reflect the truths and
knowledge of the times, then they
cannot expect to exist,

The fraternity system is especially
open to reaction on account of its
black-ball system. I mention this not
to discredit the ball system, but only
to emphasize the necessity, the ex-
treme importance of an open-minded
approach to rush next year,

The black-ball is indeed a worthy
privilege, but one which subsequently
puts responsibility on every person in
a house. In the hands of every fra-
ternity member is the future of the
fraternity system and of our Uni-
versity. Discrimination could, with-
out extending the imagination too
much, bring repercussions from the
federal government, the faculty and
administration, and possibly — civil-
rights workers around the country,

nt will be very easy for many fra-
ternities to say: “We think that
Negroes should and must be accepted
and that all fraternities will inevitably
do so; but I don't think he could
ever get into our house now. I'm
sure there are a few other houses
that will take a Negro.”

It is true that the fraternity sys-
tem could get by if this, in fact,
does happen. But what if every fra-
ternmily is saying this? What if a few
fraternities would accept a Negro, but
the Negroes who come through rush
aren't the type of persons for these
particular houses? What if a Negro
doesn't get in a house next year?

Fhe Negro issue is very sensitive to
most minds, For this reason, | am
very concerned about the approach
which most people have taken here
at Washington and Lee about a very
serious matter, One cannot expect a
fraternity member to return for rush
next year and make a rational de-
cision on such an inflammable ques-
tion without previous and lengthy
thought and discussion,

1 urge all fraternity presidents and
officers to present this issue to their
houses, and talk it out, I leave you
with your conscience and a sense of
responsibility,

ments and be allowed to take only
Math 72 his second semester,

Also concerning math, the commit-
tee further feels that the option off-
ered either to take math or an ancient
language is, to say the least, the
stipulation that the math department
offer a wider variety of courses to
freshmen. I, for one, feel that cal-
culus should not be the only alterna-
tive open to first semester freshmen
who have to take math.

Perhaps the proposal that has pro-
voked the most debate to date is one
suggesting that normal class load be
reduced from five classes a semester
to four a semester. The committee’s
vote reflects this difference of opinion:
four members were against the pro-
posal and three were in favor of
it. Briefly, the argument for fewer
classes is, of course, that students
would be able to examine their sub-
jects in greater depth through a beef-
ed-up program of only four couses
a semester. Against the plan, how-
ever, is mainly the argument that
students would be limited in the dis-
tribtuion of courses they would be
able to take.

There is a contingency that was not
considered by the committee in voting
on the above proposal. If the uni-
versity were to shift its calendar
from its present two semester form
to a program that offered two semest-
ers of twelve weeks and one semester
of six weeks, the four-class load would
indeed be advisable. A student would
be required to take four classes each
of the first two semesters and only
two the final, shorter semester. The)
advantage of such a university calen-
dar is that exams would be finished
before Christmas and before spring
vacation the first two semesters. Next

 

year this proposal will be studied in
greater depth.

Although I don't have space to|
discuss them here, other topics were |
discussed such as the present advisor |
system, and the independent major and |
the possibility of freshman seminars. |
lt was decided, for instance, that a/
single advisor should be named to |
handle independent majors in order |

Committee

to eliminate some of the present con-
fusion concerning the program.
Concerning plans for next year, |
plan this summer to write a compre-
hensive survey of what I consider to
be necessary curriculum changes. This
report will be ready for the commit-
tee’s consideration early next fall,
enabling us, I hope, to begin on a
positive note. We will also continue
on a limited scale the type of survey
undertaken this year of the political
science department. At the very least,
this survey will entail class informa-
tion in addition to that offered by the
catalogue. From such information a
student will be able to find out how
many tests and papers are assigned
in a course and what the past year’s
format was (i.e.,
sion). Finally, the committee will
initiate a system of student advisors—

lecture or discus-|

 

one in each department, in order to
provide a broader base of student)
opinion and suggestions.

In my view, next year will be
crucial for matters concerning the
curriculum. Hopefully, the ‘pass-fail
system will be expanded and the
faculty will vote on a plan to eli-
minate Saturday classes. Such initia-
tive may well set a trend for other
changes, but unless the proposals are
both definitive and workable, all
momentum might be lost. I envision,
therefore, that the Student Curriculum
Committee can be most effective as
an organ of expression which, through
the faculty committee, offers not only
new ideas but also a solid indication
of student opinion,

Board of Trustees did select Mr.

@ Submitted a resolution to the
faculty urging a revision of the exam
schedule. This was acted on by the
faculty. Although they did not accept
our plan itself, we were told that
our views and reasons for change
were helpful in founding the plan
accepted,

@ Made much needed clarifications
of Honor System procedures con-
cerning pledged work and looking in
notes and books during tests.

@ We were instrumental in discourag-
ing the Adeministraion from making
mandatory checks of student part-
ments,

@ Rewrote the Mock Honor Trial
and presented it to the freshmen.

@ Checked to make sure that Satur-
day classes on Openings and Springs
Weekends were canceled.

@ Gave funds to the Rugby Club,

@ Held a meeting to talk with Presi-
dent Huntley and find out his views
on student life.

@ Checked up on what had been
done in accordance with the Self Study
and acted accordingly where things
had not been done.

@ The Committee was instrumental
in establishing the right of the Stu-
dent Control Committee to hear any
cases dealing with drugs on campus.
This prevents any such cases from
being handled solely by faculty mem-
bers and the administration.

There are some twenty-nine more
things that have been done by the
E.C. this year, other than “N.S.K.’s”
ten and the ten I have listed. | wish
that | had the space to enumerate
them.

At any rate, it is always easy for
an “uninformed... person” to sit on
the sidelines and criticize while others
try to get things done, I will not go
so far as to say that this year’s
E.C. did a great job. But it did do
more than any E.C, in the past four
years, The records will prove this.

No, we did not capture the head-

| lines by proposing such things as

required residency in dorms. But we
never were too much for that sort

“very serious” at-| of thing anyway.

In parting, this year’s E.C. accepts
uny just criticism by any competent
and informed writers, However, we
cannot help bui laugh al those who
blindly complain about something
they know little about, We wish neat
year's Committee good luck and hope

Married couple replies to Byrum

(Continaed from page 2)

(1) Do you feel that these apart-
ments are in safe and clean condi-
tion?

The fiberboard construction is no
more a fire hazard than a_ similar
structure of wood and the buildings
pass all of the legal fire standards.
If a student notifies the school about
faulty or inadequate wiring, they
will send an electrician to correct the

problem, Old rags and junk can
be removed from the attics and
discarded.

As far as the complaints about
the apartments being difficult to keep
clean, our comment is that any
dwelling will become dirty and un-
sanitary if not cared for properly.
We rather think that the cleanliness
of an apartment is a reflection on
the occupants and not on the structure
of that apartment.

(2) What are
physical problems?

The thin walls do create a lack of
privacy, but we are all students and
we are all young and must expect
to endure certain conditions which
will end when our husbands finish
their studies and can provide “the
better things in life” for us.

As far as the rotting truss construc-
tion and holes in ceiling and walls
are concerned, we feel that this has
been exaggerated. Our apartment is
not perfect, but it is certainly not
in the described condition. Holes and
sagging ceilings can be fixed.

To call the heating “inadequate”
is perhaps the most ridiculous accusa-
tion. Through two winters we were
never once cold. At times it may
be somewhat inconvenient not to be
able to shut the bedroom doors be-
cause the heater is in the living
room, but as long as we are kept
warm—quite adequately warm—there
seems to be no room for gripes.

(3) Do you have any problems with
insects or rodents?

We have lived at Hillside for two
years, and in that time have seen
not one mouse, rat, roach, or other
“bug.” As far as the spiders are
concerned they are a nuisance which
unfortunately cannot be “sprayed
away” by the Orkin Man. He advised
us that the only way to control them
is to constantly mop down their
webs. They won't stay where their
homes are destroyed, and now I
very rarely find one in our apart-
ment,

The fleas come from students who
have dogs which are not kept clean
and which bring fleas (which nest)
school sent an exterminator who
in. Our apartment was jumping with
fleas before we moved in, but the
alleviated the problem. Since then we
have had not one flea in our apart-
ment, and we have a toy poodle
(who is bathed and brushed regularly.)

No insect or rodent is going to
stay whre it is not satisfied; if homes
are kept clean, problems will dis-
appear. The school is also happy to
send an exterminator for major prob-
lems.

(4) With help from the school and
a little work ourselves, we have had
no problems with our electrical or
gas facilities. Our apartment with
nine electrical outlets is better equip-
ped than many, but other apartments
could be fixed up so that the cir-
cuits are convenient, adequate, and
safe.

(5-6) The question of replacing Hill-
side Terrace is more complex than
perhaps many people realize. I's easy
to gripe about conditions and make
demands, but it's not always so easy
to find money for all of our desires.
To replace Hillside with nicer apart-
ments would involve a considerable
rise in rent—not the $10 or $15 which
the students would be willing to pay,
but a realistic $35 to $60 more per
month. New units cannot be con-
structed and operated for less. At
Duke, where we will continue our

the most blatant

studies, comparable apariments are

however, grows each year. If there
weren't students who need Hillside
(with its low rent) the units would
not be completely filled and couples
would not be turned away to seek
higher-rent housing in town. Three
of the six couples in units 23 and 24
had to live in town before they could
be placed at Hillside—2 for a year
and 1 for a semester. They chose to
move to Hillside instead of remain-
ing at other locations.

Those students who want and can
afford better housing should live in
town, but others should not destroy
Hillside at the expense of those stu-
dents who need it. The apartments
are comfortable and spacious; Mr.
Brady and his maintenance crew could
not be more courteous, efficient, or
quick to make any repairs upon re-
quest; and Mr. Snyder and the ad-
ministration are understanding of our
financial problems and do the very
best they can to provide for us.

By JAY PASSAVANT
Student Body President

In anything of significance that a
person undertakes, he should strive to
establish sound foundations and make

adequate — prepera-
tions before em-
barking on his

task. An education
at Washington and
Lee is no exception
to this rule and
what is more, ade-
quate preparation
(other than aca-
demics) is almost
essential to a
smooth  assimila-
tion into W&L
life. Every year, many confused and
uninformed freshmen stumble around
the campus for several months learn-

ing the general operation of various |

organizations and details of our
honored traditions as they go.
Often they unknowingly miss op-

portunities for involvement in W&L
life which are numerous during the
early part of the year and occas-
sionally their ignorance even leads to
embarrassment as they commit a
violation or break a rule that they
perhaps knew nothing about.
Unfortunately, there is no excuse
for such stumbling on the part of the
freshman. The faculty, administration,
and student government make an al-
most superhuman effort to provide
incoming students with important in-
formation during the summer prior
to their arrival and then most in-
tensively at freshman camp immedi-
ately before classes begin. However,
too many freshmen only glance at the
literature they receive during the
summer tossing it aside, and then pro-
ceed to freshman camp only to sleep

$60,000 Ford grant

Washington and Lee University
| has received a $60,000 matching grant
| from the Ford Foundation under the
|foundation’s national program to
assist humanities at four-year-liberal
arts colleges.

The University is one of 61 lead-

lion program announced by the Ford
Foundation. Two other Virginia col-
leges also were awarded grants: Holl-
ins receiving $50,000 and Randolph-
Macon Woman's College $30,000.

The grants are contingent upon their
being matched by the recipients.
Washington and Lee will use the
resulting $120,000 to initiate a pro-

Jarret, Crenshaw on leave

iwo Washington and Lee history
professors, Dr. Marshall Jarrett and

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw, will be on
leave during the 1968-69 academic
year under a program established

through the Ford Foundation grant
announced last week.

Dr. Jarrett will be on leave dur-
ing the first semester, and Dr. Cren-
shaw the second semester. In_ their
absence, their courses will be taught
by instructor Paul K. Beebee, who
replaced Dr. William A. Jenks while
the latter was on leave this year.

Plans also are being formulated to
permit two professors in the depart-
ment of religion and two in the fine
arts department to take leaves next
year (one each semester in each de-
partment). This would make a total
of six professors—three each semes-
ter—on leave during the 1968-69 year.

Under the program, each W&L
professor on leave will continue to
receive his University salary, and the
new program funds will be used to
secure his replacement.

Dr. Jarrett will carry on his con-
tinuing research and writing on a
manuscript dealing with 18th century
French intellectual history. The study
deals with the 1751 “French Ency-
clopedia” as a vehicle for dissemina-

tion of liberal social and political

ideas, with emphasis on the en-
eyclopedia’s co-editors, Diderot and
D'Alembert.

Dr. Crenshaw's work entails re-
search for a book dealing in depth
with the background of the Seces-
sionist movement in South Carolina
in the 1850's and ‘60's. It will present
a political and social picture of South
Carolina in those days as well as in
antebellum Washington, D.C.

The first year, the Foundation will
provide $25,000, the University $5,-
second year, the Foundation
$20,000, WAL $10,000; third year,
the Foundation $10,000, the Univers-
ity $20,000; and the fourth year, the
Foundation $5,000, WAL $25,000

After four the University
will then continue the leaves-of-ab
program by assuming full fi
nancial responsibility for it

Washington and Lee University has
honored its former president, Dr.
Fred C. Cole, during commencement
exercises today.

Dr. Cole and three other distin-

Troubadours offer
lecture series, new
plays for next year

Plans are already well under way
at the Troubadour Theatre for next
year. Four plays have been selected:
officers for the upcoming season have
been elected; and innevations are be-
ing proposed.

Perhaps the most unusual of next
year’s productions is “America Hur-
rah!” by Van lItallie. Mr. Itallie’s
work consists of three one-act plays
held together by a common theme
satirizing American institutions. Each
of the three acts is separtely titled;
in order, these vignettes are called:
“The Interview,” “T.V.,.” and “Motel.”

“Exit the King” by lonesco is also
on the Troubadour Theaire’s slate for
next year. It deals with the problems
of man growing old and facing
death; “Exit the King” is, in Trouba-
dour Director Lee Kahn's opinion, a
“very moving play

To the entering freshmen

As rising freshmen, you are entering Washington and Lee
University perhaps at the time of its greatest flux. Our new,
dynamic president will be inaugurated next October and the
nation’s educational leaders will witness with you this Uni-
versity’s answer to the challenge of changing times. A soon-
to-be-announced development program will correct the struc-
tural flaws in some of our historic buildings, but, as its main
goal, will enhance the University’s ability totally to serve its
students. The faculty and administration have demonstrated
not only their winningness to respond to student requests; they,
too, have joined the vanguard in evaluating—and changing
where necessary—all aspects of student concern. Our fra-
ternity system, whose eighteen members will provide this Uni-
versity’s main social outlet at least until the new Student Union

is completed next Spring, is facing a dual dilemma of having

The class of 1972: the glowing future les unrolled

It all begins with a rush

 

to reform its hundred-year-old bidding system in the same
year when its idealistic rationale of brotherhood open to all
is being tested and scrutinized as never before.

You, the class of 1972, are in a unique position to observe
the inevitable changes as they begin and to shape the out-
come of most of them. We urge you to become involved in
some area open to rigorous student participation—there is no
dearth of opportunities; come to know hard-to-get-to-know
Lexington as we have, and enjoy it; take advantage of the fact
that at Washington and Lee you will be able to establish almost
a first-name-basis rapport with many your professors; study, to
be sure, but not so diligently that these four years of excite-
—L.H.

ment and nostalgia will pass too quickly.

 

The Ring-tum Phi—Tuesday

Che Ring-tum Phi is published Tuesdays and Fridays during the college
year. It is printed by the Journalism Laboratory Press, Washington and Lee
University. The mailing address is Box 899, Lexington, Virginia 24450.

Entered as second class matter September 29, 1946, at the Post Office,
Lexington, Virginia 24450, under the act of March 3, 1879.

Subscription rates: $6.00 for the school year, $3.00 for the semester.

A Message to the New Students

The traditions of Washington and Lee University require conven-
tional dress. Our shop, in keeping with these traditions, is designed
solely for the W &L man and features the natural
shoulder style prevailing on our campus.

The correct appearance of both “on and off” campus is so very im-
portant throughout the school year . . .

 

 

AND YOU CERTAINLY WANT TO LOOK YOUR BEST
DURING RUSH WEEK.

Our long experience with W&L men enables us to soundly advise

and fill all your complete clothing requirements in the beginning
and throughout the school year.

You, as a student of W&L, hold the priviledge of an open charge ac-

count, either billed direct to you or to your home, or both, whatever

the case may be. We hope you will make use of this and our many
other services.

 

We cordially invite your correspondence on particular apparel prob-
lems that you may have. You may be assured of our personal and

prompt attention to each and every inquiry made.
