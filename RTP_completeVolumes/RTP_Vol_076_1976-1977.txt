E.C. budget finalized

By FRITZ GOLDBERG

The Executive Committee of
the Student Body completed its
annual ritual of Autumn Tuesday
night by taking a first vote on
the amount of dollars to be al-
lotted to the various student com-
mittees and activities on campus.

The budget process will not be
formally complete until a two-
thirds vote of the E.C. comes
down-—a week after the first vote,
at least, according to the consti-
tution—but the figures agreed to
this week settle everything except
the sticky business of publications
salaries, a topic that promises to
bring about a great deal of strong
words and gnashing of teeth at
the committee’s regular meeting
Monday night, Oct. 4, at 7 o’clock.

The subject of salaries came up
Tuesday night when the E.C. ap-
propriated $700 for the Ariel

budget. The allotment carried an
amendment saying that none of
the money could go toward a
salary for the literary magazine’s
editor, Mark Richard. Richard had
requested $800 from the E.C.

The E.C, also voted to spend $19
to pay for a keg of beer con-
sumed at an Ariel reading session
last year, but not paid for by
last year’s staff.

The sixty-year-old tradition of
paying salaries to editors came up
again when the Ring-tum Phi and
Calyx budgets were discussed.
The newspaper received $3920
and the yearbook got $8400. The
two budgets were cut $200 and
$350, respectively, until the E.C.
decides whether the editors and
business managers of the publica-
tions will receive renumeration
for their efforts.

The persons who argue against

Faculty committee
members chosen

By Wander J. Lorentz daHaas

The Executive Committee held
its second regular weekly meeting
Monday night at 7 p.m.

At the outset of the session,
Dean John, amidst constrained
smiles, swore in the respective
student elected members in at-
tendance for the 76-77 school
year. This group consisted of the
EC representatives, LF.C. chair-
man and chairmen from a handful
of other committees.

Then as quickly as he had ar-
rived, President Tom Hunter ex-
cused himself and Vice-president
Sandy Stradtman took over. He
announced that selections for the
Who’s Who committee will be
made on Monday, October 4, after
the EC meeting that evening.
Next, Neil Pentifallo, who is head-
ing up an ad-hoc committee con-
cerning possible changes in the
academic schedule, requested that
any comments in relation to this
matter be brought to his attention
by the student body.

Finally, Sandy Stradtman re-
ported that the applications for
membership to several openings
on committees were insufficient in
number to be reviewed at this
time. Henee the application date
for the following committees was
extended to 7 p.m. October 4:
Athletics, Library, and Health.

With this action, the E.C.’s final
business at hand was completed
and they shifted their attention
to processing the applications for
the Admissions, Courses and De-
arees, Lectures, Financial Aid
and Faculty Executive Commit-
Lees.

The following persons were ap-
pointed to those committees: Ted
de Saussure, Courses and De-
grees; Kirk Ruffin, Faculty E.C.;
Barry Godin and Jim Falk, Ad-
missions; Rob Sult and Peter
Goss, Financial Aid, and Sam

Rogers, lectures

ADDENDUM
By JOE FITZGERALD

Monday night’s interviews of
applicants for faculty committee
positions were open to the press
and public. This is not to say that
any revealing reports on the grill-
ing of the prospective committee
members are forthcoming. In fact,
at least two of the journalists in
attendance left before the E.C.
had finished with the first com-
mittee.

The fact that makes the open
meetings worthwhile is that they
were not open last year in spite
of a clause in the student body
constitution which clearly states
that the meetings can only be
closed for the discussion of pos-
sible honor violations. The E.C.
closed the meetings in the past
saying that the people being in-
terviewed would be more open
and more frank in close session.
This argument was used even
though the student body voted to
open the meetings three years ago
while this very argument was
being displayed on the front page
of the Ring-tum Phi.

The meetings are open now
because a determined senior
representative, Walt Kelley, with
the help of sophomore Neil Penti-
fallo, launched a presuasive cam-
paign before the meeting Monday
night te convince the other mem-
bers that the student body con-
stitution was written to tell the
E.C. how to act, not to fill space
in the student handbook.

We do not know exactly what
Kelley did to bring about this
startling change in the executive
attitude. We do know that when
E.C. Secretary Radar Davis was
asked about the new policy Tues-
day he asked innocently, “Haven't

paying salaries to the heads of
the publications—these persons
are known as fiscal conservaties—-
argue that the leaders of other
student committees and organiza-
tions do not get paid for their
work.

The persons in favor of the
salaries—these persons are known
as editors—argue that the other
chairmen do not have to meet
regular publication deadlines or
put out a weekly newspaper. They
also argue that the salaries, which
are proportionate to the profit the
publication makes, encourage the
editors to do a better job.

The Student Bar Association re-
ceived a $7013 allocation. The
amount is two-thirds of the money
paid in student activity fees by
law students. The other third will,
in theory, go towards paying for
the law students’ attendance at
Contact and SAB functions.

The Curriculum Committee re-

: ceived all of its $310 request.

The Student Activities Board
received $32,260, about a thous-
and dollars less than its request.
The budget was cut presumably
on the theory that everyone pads
the budget request anyway and
the smaller amount will make the
SAB co-chairmen, Mike Arm-
strong and John Berley, work a
little harder.

E.C. Vice-President Sandy
Stradtman suggested an additional
$500 cut to keep the co-chair-
men jumping but the idea was
not carried out.

The “Big Bang” theory of We&L

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER
On the morning of Wednesday,
Sept. 22, around 11:15 a.m., James
Mallory of Woods Creek East had
just finished eating a lat.’ morn-
ing brunch. He was thinking about
the dirty dishes he had to wash
when he heard the sound of an
explosion from the new library
site. As soon as he went to the
glass door in his apartment to
investigate, a rock, about the size
of a man’s hand, came crashing
in three inches above his head
and another one two inches to
the right of his feet. Glass was
subsequently thrown all over him.
Col. Louis McFadden, Maj. Wolf
Kutter, and Sgt. Gordon Cameron
had been warned about the blast
and were standing in the back of

ITN reporter scheduled
for Lee Chapel lecture

Sandy Gall, a reporter and
newscaster for Independent Tele-
vision News (ITN) in London, will
speak in Lee Chapel on Tuesday,
Oct. 5 at 8:00 p.m.

Gall, who speaks fluent French
and German, was educated at
Trinity College in Scotland, and
at the Universities of Aberdeen,
Bonn and Mainz. As a reporter
for Reuters and ITN, Gall has
travelled all over the world. He
has reported on the Congo war,
the 1967 Middle East war, Viet-
nam, the Paris riots in 1968 and
the 1973 Middle East war.

In 1970 he began newscasting
for ITN in addition to reporting;
he still performs this dual role. In
1972, he covered the expulsion of
the Asian community from Ugan-
da. During this time he was
arrested by the Uganda army and
held for three days in the military
police barracks outside Kampala.
In 1973 he was in Jordan at the
time of the Yom Kippur war. Gall
was in Vietnam in 1975 when
Saigon fell to the North Viet-
namese; he remained for three
weeks, and left with film footage
that was later shown throughout
the world. Recently he has been
in Spain to cover the democratic
progress of the Carlos govern-
ment.

In addition to reporting and
newscasting, Gall has made doecu-
mentary films, including one on

King Hussein and one on the
Cresta Run
Gall will speak to several

classes. Among the topics he will
eover are the media in Britain,
Britain's future in the world (in
cluding colonial problems in Rho
desia) and his experiences as a
foreign correspondent

‘the ROTC lot.

the ROTC building when the blast
went off. Two seconds later, they
watched as a shower of rocks and
dirt damaged six cars parked in
The rocks also
battered the tin roof on the Build-
ing. Col. McFadden ran upstairs to
see if anyone was hurt. He found
no one hurt by the explosion, but
one of his secretaries had been
burnt with hot coffee. In the mad
scrample to get under the desks
for protection, Mrs. Kathleen
Dunlap knocked a pot of hot
coffee onto Mrs. Trois A. Moore.

Further investigation by Mc-
Fadden revealed that both win-
dows in his office had been blown
out and the ROTC building itself
had a four-inch dent in its side.

At the same time, Rodney
Cooke was on “the hill” worrying
about whether or not he would
have a ticket on his windshield
for parking illegally on the ROTC
road. When he returned to his car
later in the afternoon, he didn’t
have a ticket—-nor did he have a
windshield.

Jerry Maatman was in class
thinking about the preparations
he had yet to make before his
hometown honey arrived for the
weekend. Little did he knows that
because of a rock crashing in the
window next to his pillow, he
would have to cope with a cold
draft of air for that ensuing
weekend.

Bob Szezecinski, who rooms in
the same Woods Creek East apart
ment as Maatman, was there at
the time of the rock's entry
Szezecinski, who was obviously in-
volved in deep study, later told
Maatman that he believed some-
one had threwn the rock through
the window.

Prof. Griffith of the Economics
Dept. was teaching a class at the
time of the blast. The vibrations
from the blast rocked his lectern
and seattered his notes all over
the floor. It is reported that Prof
Griffith blamed the incident on
the SDS

All in all, the blast did quite a
bit of damage. Besides the dam
age to the apartments, ROTC
building. and the cars, an air
compressor used by Riddleburger
Co. was damaged to the extent of
$8000

What caused that blast to wreak
so much damage and throw “mini
ature boulders” 150-175 yards?
The other times dynamite was
used, nothing of that sort had
happened

An employee of Barger Con
struction said that the eharge
used was not stronger than any
previous one, The only difference

was in the lithology. It was not
solid rock, as had been true for
the other blastings, but rather
dirt, shale, and some solid rock.
Therefore, the dynamite used
under those conditions was too
strong.

Two rows of dynamite, one
above the other, were laid in holes
20 feet deep. The bottom row ex-
ploded a fraction of a second
before the top, knocking out the
top one’s foundation. When the
force of the top blast met the
force of the bottom blast, the
only place for the explosion to go
was out and up.

Orson Hostetter, a superinten-
dent for Barger. admitted that
the charge used was too strong.
He also confirmed reports that
the man who did the blasting had
been relieved of his job at the

ARA suit settled;

Darrel in charge

By JOHN HASTINGS

In 1959, Washington and Lee
University contracted ARA-Slater
Food Services to run the Evans
Dining Hall. Last January the
University decided that ARA’s
servies were no longer required
and terminated the contract.

The action seemed not to carry
any serious reprecussions until the
University violated one of the
terms of the contract and re-hired
Dining Service Manager Jerry
Darrell three months before the
six-month period was over. In
order to prevent W&Lfrom setting
a precedent for other schools in
the area to follow, ARA took W&L
to court.

The reason for the school’s
severing ties with ARA was that
as foed costs rose, the University
had to pay ARA to meet those
costs and enough for a_ profit.
Darrell had worked at W&L for
seven years, all with ARA, and
felt that he had the experience
and the personnel to succesfully
manage the dining hall.

Darrell’s reaction to W&L’s
withdrawal was, obviously, one of
elation. Not only was he now in
complete control of the facilities,
but he had more money to work
with. Darrell had actually been
hindered slightly by being in an
ARA franchise because he had to
buy through certain channels and

could not search for culinary
bargains.
The University Treasurer,

James W. Whitehead, re-iterated
Darrell’s feelings. When the
school was called to court in
September, Whitehead represent-
ed W&L. Rather than go through
with the court proceedings, the
two parties agreed to come to a
settlement out of court. The final
decision, which was agreeable to
all concerned, was that W&L
would retain Darrel at his present
position and that ARA would serve
in an advisory capacity for the
fall term. The actual cost to the
school could not be disclosed,

SENIORS’ MIXER

A mixer for seniors and only
seniors will be held on Oct. 5 in
conjunction with the senior
classes of Hollins, Sweet Briar,
Randolph-Macon, and Mary Bald-
win. For the sume of one dollar,
seniors and only seniors may
drink at will (liquor, yes, you
heard right, liquor) and dance to
the music of Fat Juke. The festivi
ties will begin at 8:30 p.m. in
Evans Dining Hall; tickets may
be purchased by seniors and only
seniors at the information desk
in the Student Center.

McClure estate leaves
$4 million to University

Washington and Lee University
has received a bequest valued at
approximately $4 million from the
estate of the late Mrs. Miriam
Caperton Alexander McClure of
New Orleans, La., who died last
Feb. 27.

Mrs. MeClure’s bequest is un
restricted and represents the bulk
of her estate. It will be applied
toward completion of the Uni
versity’s ongoing development
program for the decade of the
1970's. according to President
Robert E. R. Huntley, who an
nounced the gift

Mrs. MeClure was the daughter
of a W&L alumnus and the widow
of another

She was also a descendant of
the founder of Augusta Academy
the little school that eventually

grew into W&L. Robert Alex
ander, her ancestor, emigrated
from Ulster to America in 1737

and founded the Academy in 1749

Hier husband was Dr. Matthew
Thompson MeClure Jr. a 1904
W&L graduate who died in 1064
He was dean of the University ol
Illinois and professor of philoso

phy for 30 years, until his re
tirement in 1951, when he and
Mrs. McClure moved to New
Orleans, where her parents had
lived for many years

After graduation from Wé&l

he earned the M.A. degree at the
University of Virginia and the
Vvh.D. from Columbia. He taught

at Columbia and Tulane before go
ing to Illinois. In 1938, W&L
awarded him the honorary doctor
of laws degree.

Mrs. McClure’s father, the Res
William MeFaddin Alexander
studied at W&L from 1881 to 1884,
and was graduated from Unien
Theological Seminary in 1887, He
was a Presbyterian minister in
New Orleans for 40 years. In
1898, when he was 36 years old
W&L awarded him an honorary
doctor of divinity degree

In a letter to a W&L official
shortly after the death of her hus
band, Mrs. McClure wrote: “We
have always had a warm affection
for the University, It has alway
been of interest to me to know
that both my father and my hus

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

Thursday, September 30, 1976

Honor

All right, so editorials aren't just for editors, What follows
is an abridged version of a speech delivered by Student Body
Vice-President Sandy Stradtman at the freshman orientation
at. Natural Bridge. Mr. Stradtman addresses himself to the
principle of Honor.

* * * *

I trust that you know by now that we're here at Natural
Bridge to learn about the Honor Code; but, let me tell you,
you're missing the point entirely if you think that to do so
is merely to become familiar with a set of rules. Quite the
contrary. To learn about the Honor Code at Washnigton
and Lee is to be let in on a philosophy that runs much deeper
than any set of rules. It is to be let in on something that goes
far beyond tradition. Indeed, it is to learn about a belief that
presently binds and will continue to bind together W&L men
both on and off this campus for years to come; if, that is,
you confront this year with the belief that honor, above all
else, must characterize those of us here at W&L.

You see, we place a lot of emphasis on trust here. We don't
think it’s too much to ask for a man to do his own work,
represent himself truthfully, and claim only that.which is his.
\nd believe me you're going to have contact with guys here
for whom these three simple requests mean everything; guys
who are appalled by even the thought that they might not
be able to believe what their fellow classmates say, guys whose
stocachs turn at the thought of their friends cheating to get
ahead of them, guys who can casily muster up almost a hatred
for someone who steals from another,

These kinds of feelings, though, are not as extreme as
they might seem at first hearing, Because, remember, their
feelings are not based on something as inherently “cold” as
a set of written rules—no, not quite. Rules rarely engender in
a man that kind of intense emotion, But heartfelt beliefs do,
and it is that heartfelt belief, that conviction that to be honor-
able is to live as a man ought, that forms the impenetrable
base of the Honor System at Washington and Lee.

The Honor System is ours, It is not structured to work
avinst us. [t is not an ever-present guard over our every action,
\nd—it's not devised to put fear into the honest man, What
is true is that the Honor System exists to insure that we have
the kind of community that years and years of experience have
told us is the most desirable, that community which reinforces
the attitudes which are slipping away so rapidly elsewhere
today, Let me just pass on a word of caution which, similarly,
someone passed on to me; this is, that although the mechanics
of the system are important to learn, it is the principle, the
rationale, that we want you to come to grips with in the next
few davs. And let me suggest that we cannot maintain the
honorable community that we now have unless you all decide
right now to do your part during the coming year.

Undoubtedly, from time to time, you will hear comments
like “stealing a sign or a Bie pen is not that big a deal,” or
“vetting one answer off one guy's paper is certainly not going
to hurt anything,” or “aw, he won't care if 1 take just this
one beer.” Well, the fact is that here at W&L we do care,
and we care just as much about these type things as we de
about full-fledged copying, outright stealing, and blatant lv-
ing—beeause the overwhelming majority of people here on
this campus is smart enough to understand that honor is not
measured by degree; such is only a sad rationalization for
someone who lacks the conviction that it takes to be a man
of honor, Either we try to be honest or we don't, T just can't
see that there is any room fora guy who is honest most of the
time ina university which sends representatives all over the
country telling people that we have the most effective honor
vstem of any college we know,

We do have one of the best universities in this country
\nd vou can bet that we can attribute a lot of that success
to just what we're here to talk about during these two days-
We \nd I'm going to graduate in 1977

What do you do with

By BILL THOMSON
How about this one?
You are a senior who has ma-

jored in an area you “liked.” Now

you are thinking of looking for a

job/graduate school to keep you

busy after graduation. And there's
only one problem: you don’t have
the slightest idea of what you
want to do. An unfortunate situa-
tion, to say the least. A situation
that Mike Cappeto and Curtis

Hubbard are doing their best to

eliminate.

Cappeto, director of career coun-
seling and placement, and Hub-
bard, his assistant director, say
they hope that most of the advice
and assistance they give this year
will be centered on the under-
classmen.

It’s not that they dislike seniors.
They would, however, prefer to

reach the underclassmen early so
that students will not find them-
selves with a useless degree and
no plans at the end of their col-
lege careers.

Cappeto estimates that about
40 per cent of Washington and
Lee graduates go directly to some
form of graduate school while the
other 60 per cent enter the job
market. Cappeto and Hubbard
work together to assist seniors in
finding jobs or graduate schools
for which they are best suited.

“We realize fully that we can’t
bring in enough people to adequ-
ately employ all W&L seniors who
are looking for jobs,” said Cap-
peto, who is beginning his second
year at W&L. However, he is
“actively seeking” for representa-
tives from law schools, MBA pro-
grams, colleges and businesses to

an ---ology degree’?

this school year. As part of his
program to help establish stu-
dent career objectives and goals,
he recommends that juniors (and
even sophomores)s chedule inter-
views with representatives from
these organizations.

In addition to its usual efforts,
the Office of Career Counseling
and Placement is attempting to
enlist the aid of alumni who
would be willing to consider W&L
graduates for employment. So far,
Cappeto said, the alumni have
been far more active in the
recruitment of students than in
the placement of them after they
earn their degrees. He said,
though, that progress is being
made and that several alumni
have been discussing a placement
program for graduates.

Brass quintet leads program

of “serious

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity Concert Guild opens its
1976-77 season tonight with the
Annapolis Brass Quintet.

The concert will take place at
8 p.m. in W&L’s Lee Chapel. This
is a return engagement for the
Quintet, which performed at
Washington and Lee three years
ago.

The program includes the first
public performance of “Quintet
No. 3” by Robert Stewart, profes-
sor of music at W&L. In addition,
the quintet will present the
American premiere of “Capriccio”
by Karl Pilss. Also on the pro-
gram are works by Claude Le-
Jeune, Giles Farnaby and Igor
Stravinsky.

The Annapolis Brass Quintet
was formed as a full-time en-
semble in 1971. Two of its cur-
rent members first organized the
group in 1967 when they were
midshipmen at the U.S. Naval
Academy, and for four years the
group was the academy’s official
brass ensemble.

The Quintet tours extensively
and this winter will perform in
the Midwest, the western United
States, and in Europe. It also has
three record albums to its cerdit.

Tonight’s is the first of eight
concerts the W&L Guild will spen-
sor this year. The next presenta-
tion, in mid-October, will be a
program of vocal music perfomed
by Miss Ann Tedards, a soprano
who specializes in Italian, French,
and English music of the six-
teenth and seventeenth centuries.

In November Canadian pianist
Robert Silverman will make his
second appearance on the Guild
Series, having performed here
four vears ago. Also scheduled for
November is a lecture recital on
oriental music by Tsai-Png Liang,
distinguished Chineses musicolog-
iest and performer from Taipei.
ilis appearance is co-sponsored by
the Asian Studies Program at
WA&L. Rounding out the fall pro-
gram is a concert to be given by
Frances Cole, harpsichordist.

TheStradvari Quartet leads off
the winter series with a conert
scheduled for January 19. This
string quartet needs little intro-
duction to Lexington audiences,

having performed here several
times in recent years. A compos-
ers’ workshop is planned for the
night preceding the concert;
music students are being encour-
aged to compose pieces for the
quartet to play during this session.

Two concerts in February will
close out the ’76-’77 seasons. Aline
van Barentzen (pianist), and Rolf
Bjorling (tenor), Miss Barentzen’s
performance here, one of several
stops on her American tour, will
include a piano concerto to be

performed in conjunction with

the Rockbridge Orchestra.

The Rockbridge Concert-
Theatre Series has also lined up
an impressive program for the
coming season. The Series, the
oldest community concert associa-
tion in the area, has been bring-
ing its audiences musical and
theatrical programs of high qual-
ity for 30 years.

Max Morath, ragtime pianist-
singer-comedian, will perform in
Lexington in November. His one-
man show blends humor, music,
history and satire into a bright
and affectionate look at a bygone
era. He has won critical acclaim
for his interpretation of America’s
musical past, and has performed
frequently on stage and television.

The Ciompi Quartet, quartet-in-
residence at Duke University, will
perform in Lee Chapel in Janu-
ary. Since in formation in 1965
the group has been delighting
regional concert goers with its

campus concerts

The Waverly Consort closes out
the RC-TS with a concert of Medi-
eval, Renaissance and Baroque
music. Composed of nine bril-
liant players and singers, the
group performs period music
ranging from  pastorales and
marigals to ribald drinking songs
and ballads of courtly love. The
Consort’s annual New York sub-
scription series at Lincoln Center
has sold out for two years in a
row.

Hubbard, a new member of the
WL administration, previously
woiked with the dean of men in
the housing office at Hampton
Institute. In addition to his in-
terest in minority affairs, he is
the faculty advisor to the Student
Association for Black Unity
(SABU) and an assistant dean of
students.

Cappeto (who adivses student
organizations and is in charge of
the University Federation and the
Early-Fielding Student Center)
said that he and Hubbard act as
a team and split duties “down
the middle.” With the objective
of establishing contacts on the
East coast “from Maine to
Florida,’ they have a number of
programs planned for this year.

Though some of the programs
are still in the planning stages,
others are definite. In addition to
the interviews by various schools
and businesses, there will be a
seminar on the techniques of in-
terviewing and another “Meet the
Professionals” program (which
Cappeto initiated last year). A
survey which will soon be sent
out to last year’s graduates will
provide information concerning
their post-college employment
and will hopefully act as a pre-
dictor for future classes. Results
of this survey should be available
soon after the beginning of the
next calendar year.

Cappeto and Hubbard are
enthusiastic about their proposed
projects and hope to expand exist-
ing programs.

“We can’t make decisions for
the students,” said Cappeto, “But
we are happy to give advice and
we know where to get additional
information.”

Recruitment committee
aids admissions office

By M. GRAY COLEMAN

Those W&L students who regu-
larly visit the Admissions offices
on the second floor of Washington
Hall may have recently noticed a
sharp decrease in the volume of
pedestrian traffic there. This
happy break for the nerves of
the assorted deans and secretaries
is basically due to the creation of
a new student committee for re-
cruitment. For this academic year
it is being chaired by Dave Me-
Lean and Steve Mangum, with
the assistance of assistant admis-
sions director Ken Ruscio.

The result of several months of
eareful planning by students and
administrators alike, the commit-
tee began work this month. Its
primary duties lie within the Ad-
missions Department—conducting
on-campus tours and regional col-
lege night programs for prospec.
tive students, Other responsibili-
ties are being added as time goes

on. These may include the handl-
ing of scholarship weekends,
visits by guidance counselors, and
so forth.

The philosophy behind the com-
mittee is that the present students |
are the best recruiters that W&L |
has. By seeing and speaking with
an active member of the student —
body, the potential freshman will —
hopefully gain a deeper insight
into what the “W&L Lifestyle” is
like. Also, the committee mem-
bers are chosen with an eye to
campus involvement and variety
of majors. In this way, visitors
an be assured of an informal tour-
guide, and can speak to a stu:
dent with academic interests
similar to their own.

“There is a lot of room for
creativity in this committee,” said
Mr. Ruscio. “In essence, this is
another chance for us to show
off our student body, which is a

Soccer team loses opener

their regular season with a 3-0
conference loss to Eastern Men-
nonite in Harrisonburg last Thurs-
day. As the score indicates the
team suffered from a lack of
offensive power, and finished with
only two shots on goal.

Goalies Reid Taylor and Mark
Bennett both played a half with
each recording five saves. Bennett
gave up the first EMC goal, with
Taylor in the net for the final
two, one coming on an indirect
kick.

The Generals were at home
yesterday against Radford, and
travel to North Carolina to play
Guilford and UNC-Greensboro
this weekend. The kickers have
an important home game on Oct.
6th when they host the University
of Virginia on Wilson Field. Game
time is 3:00 p.m.

The J.V. soccer Generals de-
feated Dabney Lancaster Com-

munity College last Saturday, 4-0.

The W&L booters have three
backs as the 1976 tri-captains,
and that area is regarded as the
team’s strongest. Senior Jeff Barr
is playing his fourth varsity sea-
son, and is a very steady and
consistent defender. Junior Mark
Derbyshire, the team workhorse,
is called by Piranian ‘an out-
standing leader,” and will give the
Generals a 100% effort at all
times, The third captain is senior
Mike Monahan, a hard tackler,
and versatile performer, who may
also see time on the line.

The goalkeeper situation is a
solid one, with junior Mark Ben-
nett, a 1975 V.LS.A. All-Star game
selection,, and freshman Neal
Crider fighting it out. Bennett is
regarded as a good clearer, while
Crider is an outstanding leaper.

Generals lose two,

face R-M Saturday

The football Generals return
home this Saturday, October 2nd,
looking for their first victory of
1976. W&L plays host to the
Randolph-Macon Yellow Jackets
in an Old Dominion Athletie Con-
ference game beginning at 1:30
p.m. on Wilson Field. Both W&L
and R-M are 0-2 on the year, the
Generals coming off a 20-0 de-
feat at the hands of Centre Col-
lege, while R-M was drubbed 49-15
by Towson State last weekend.

Last Saturday was a frustrat-
ing one in Danville, Ky., and it
was evident from the opening
kickoff that it wasn’t to be W&L’s
day. Washington and Lee trailed
9-0 at halftime on the strength of
a Safety, and a 66 yard run by
Centre halfback Jim Shannon. It
was the second straight week that
W&L was victimized by a long
scoring play.

Having to play catch up foot-
ball, W&L quarterback Ted Hissey
was forced to go to the air, and
finished the game with eight com-
pletions in 26 attempts. Facing a
strong Centre pass rush, he was
often forced to throw early, and
was the victim of dropped passes
in key situations. Centre had 330
yards in total offense to the Gen-
erals’ 180 yards, and gained 13
first downs to W&L’s ten. The
Colonels’ running attack carried
them in this game, as they ran 57

times for 267 yards. W&L was
only able to gain 105 rushing
yards, with halfback Raynard
Scott the leading rusher with 37
yards,

The key to the game was in
turnovers. Centre had only one, a
32 yard interception by strong
safety Bryan Sibson, while the
Generals were intercepted three
times, and fumbled the ball away
an additional three times. W&L’s
usually potent passing attack was
unable to get untracked and fin-
ished with only 75 yards. Flanker
Richard Wiles caught three passes
for 31 yards.

The Generals defensive player
of the week was senior Jack
Reeves, a 6-0, 205 Ib. tackle from
Lexington. He was credited with
three solo tackles and six assists
in the Centre game. Junior
Raynard Scott, a 5-10, 180 Ib. half-
back from Frederick, Md., was
named the team’s offensive player
of the week for his performance
last weekend.

The Randolph-Macon game on
Saturday is the Generals’ second
conference game of 1976, the team
having lost their season opener
to Emory and Henry, 24-17 The
game is the first O.D.A.C. tilt for
the Yellow Jackets, who have
won four of the last five meet-
ings between the teams, including
a 26-14 decision in 1975.

should lead the ’76 scoring attack.
Collier, whose father owns the
Cleveland Cobras of the American
Soccer League, is small, but has
the confidence of Piranian when
it comes to putting the ball in
the goal. Tyson makes a good
target man because of his height,
and was the General’s leading
scorer last season. Much of the
kickers’ scoring punch will come
from these two players.

Sophmore Ed Grandes del Mazo,
and Woods King will point the tri-
captains as the teams’ leading
backs. Grandes del Mazo reads the
field well, and if fully recovered
from his back problems, should
have an outstanding year. King
keeps cool under pressure, and
should be the Generals’ starting
center halfback.

Coach Piranian talks enthusi-
astically about the ’76 season, and
sets as the teams’ immediate goal
that of a winning season. Realis-
tically he believes his charges
have the ability to challenge for
both the O.D.A.C. and the V.LS.A.
championships.

The complete 1976 schedule
follows: Sept. 23, at Eastern
Mennonite, Sept. 29, Radford
(home), Oct. 1, at Guilford, Oct. 2,

Harriers split meet,

record first victory

The cross country Generals be-
came the first W&L varsity
athletic team of 1976-77 to gain a

-vietory, as they split their tri-

meet with Oavis & Elkins and
Shepherd College last Saturday.
The harriers defeated Shepherd
16-39, but lost to Davis & Elkins
by a 16-43 score. Low score wins
in cross country, with 15-50 being
a perfect score.

Junior Allen Weeks was the
Generals’ top runner, coming in
fifth with a time of 29:26 for the
five mile course. The winner was
D&E’s Mike Redman with a time
of 28:03. W&L also had the sev-
enth and eighth place finishers in
freshman Richard Bird (29:49), a
native of Lexington and sopho-
more Jim Frantz (30:02)

Coach Dick Miller’s runners
have their next meet on October
2nd, competing in a_ tri-meet
against Norfolk State and Roa-
noke in Salem, Va.

Flesher's sports outloo

By BILL FLESHER

Of this and that (or how to fill
space when the idea bin is
temporarily empty):

It may seem odd for a team
from Wahooland to be invading
Lexington any time before April
or May, but such a visit will occur
next Wednesday.

That’s when W&L’s soccer team
hosts Virginia for the first time
in many a year. The game gets
underway at 3 p.m. on Wilson
Field.

The Cavaliers perenially field
one of the state’s better soccer
squads, although in recent years
they have been surpassed by Madi-
son as the top team in the Com-
monwealth.

Coached by Larry Gross, who
is lacrosse coach Glen Thiel’s as-
sistant, Virginia’s squad includes
several of those who have never
experienced victory over a_par-
ticular W&L team (guess which
one).

Any W&L-UVa matchup pro-
vides for some interesting oc-
currences, and this one should be
no exception, especially if the

Generals can get it going during

this weekend’s two-game swing in

Greensboro against Guilford and

UNC-Greensboro.
ne % a

W&L athletics will be the
theme of half-hour shows on both
of the University electronic media
outlets this fall.

Cable 9-TV will air a weekly
show tentatively titled “The Gen-
erals Club” on Tuesday evening
at 7:15, while WLUR-FM (91.5
mhz) features a sports magazine-
type program Mondays at 5:30.

Both shows will center around
football during the fall, with film
highlights of previous games
shown on the television program.

As of this writing, WLUR has
no immediate plans regarding
play-by-play broadcasts of any of
the Generals’ away games, but at-
tempts to arrange them are in
the works.

oy ae an

That remark in last week’s
column about the Generals’ tennis
team becoming a national power
may not be so far-fetched.

Though a fifth-place finish in

last week’s Naval Academy In-
vitational wouldn't indicate it,
W&L proved it could play with
some of the best college teams in
the East, including Maryland, Vir-
ginia, and Navy.

Senior captain Ken Voelker
fared best for W&L, winning
three-set matches over John Irwin
of Swarthmore and Dalurton of
Virginia before dropping a three-
set semifinal match to Steve Mer-
chant of Navy.

The other point-scorer for the
Generals was a freshman doubles
team of Stewart Jackson and Pat
Norris, who downed Maryland’s
number two doubles team in three
sets.

Indicitave of how close the Gen-
erals were able to stay was junior
Ben Johns, who dropped two tie-
breakers to Maryland’s number
one player, John Olson, 7-6, 4-6,
7-6.

W&L travels to Madison for a
double dual meet with the Dukes
and William and Mary this week-
end. The Generals will host the
Fall State Tennis Tournament the
weekend of October 8-9-10.

 

Curator named

Capt. Robert © Peniston, a U.S.
Navy officer for 30 years until
his retirement jast summer, has
been named te the new post of
director of Lee Chapel.

He will have day-to-day ad-
ministrative responsibility for our
favorite Naional Historic Land-
mark.

Capt. Pemston’s appointment
was announced by James W.
Whitehead, chapel curator. The
changes in the chapel administra-
tion came after John E. Hughes,
chapel curator since 1968, left
W&L this fall to go into the in-
surance business.

Whitehead said Patrick C.
Brennan, senior, will remain as
student curator of the Chapel, a
post he has held for two years.

Capt. Peniston was director of
naval educational development at
Pensacola, Fla. at the time of
his retirement. In the capacity he
had responsibility for undergradu-
at and postgraduate programs at
the Naval Academy, in Navy
R.O.T.C. programs at 58 colleges
and universities, and elsewhere in
the field.

He has also had extensive man-
agement experience with the
Atlantic Fleet, where he directed
the activities of 300 ships and
1400 aircraft, and in the naval
personnel bureau. He was as-
sistant to the president of the
Naval War College from 1962 to
1964, and was commander of four
combat ships at various times be-
tween 1959 and 1971.

He is a graduate of the Naval
Academy and received _sihis
master’s degree-in personnel ad-
ministration from Stanford Uni-
versity. He holds a number of
decorations, including the Legion
of Merit and the Meritorious Ser-
vice Medal with two gold stars.

Ile is a native of Missouri and
is married to the former Frances
McKelvy of Washington, D.C.
They have a doughter, Lisa. Their
son, Robert Carl Peniston, was a
senior at W&L at the time of his
death in 1975, and it was that
connection with W&L that led
Penistons to move to Lexington.

Gooch estate donates
1.8 million to W&L

Washington and Lee University
has received more than $1.6 mil-
lion from the estate of the late
Richard E. Gooch of Lynchburg
and Lexington, a 1930 W&L gradu-
ate.

The larger share of the gift,
$1,523,000, is in the form of an
unrestricted bequest from his
estate. The remaining portion,
$97,386, is in the form of a life
insurance policy which Mr. Gooch
purchased specifically to benefit
W&L’s Department of Journalism
and Communications, one of his
primary interests.

The unrestricted $1.5-million
bequest will be used to help W&L
toward completion of the capital
construction portion of its on-
going development program for
the 1970s, the university said. In
addition to additions to physical
facilities, that development pro-
gram includes substantial addi-
tions to W&L’s permanent en.
dowment and support for annual
operating costs as well.

Mr. Gooch died Dec. 30, 1974,
at the age of 70. He was born in
Lynchburg, but spent most of
his life in Europe. He attended
the Darlington School in Rome,
Ga., and then W&L where he
earned the B.A. degree. He also
held a master’s degree from Duke
University.

Throughout his adult life he
was a steadfast supporter of W&L,
and it was largely his connection
with W&L that led him to acquire
an apartment in Lexington after
his retirement. He was a member
of the Generals’ Council, the
group of W&L’s most generous
benefactors, and was also an
ardent supporter of WLUR-FM,
the campus radio station. Among
the gifts he made to W&L during
his lifetime were many designated
for operating expenses, equip
ment purchases, and expansion of
the station

Through a geographical quirk,
Mr. Gooch was able to pick up

WLUR’s 10-watt signal in Lynch-
burg, 40 miles away, although a
signal of that strength usually
travels only a couple of miles. It
was a phenomenon that deepened
his interest in journalism broad-
casting at his alma mater, and he
became instrumental in enabl-
ing the station to increase its
signal strength to 180 watts.

Always interested in modern
communications technology, Mr.
Gooch also contributed a sophis-
ticated audio cassette system to
W&L’s McCormick Library as a
basic element in the “non-book”
information resource field. He
visited WLUR’s studios frequently
to watch the station’s operations,
and in recent years he gave an
elegant banquet each spring for
the university's graduating journ-
alism majors.

His bequest to W&L represents
50 per cent of his estate after a
number of specific bequests to
three Lynchburg churches, the
YMCA and YWCA, and the Hu-
mane Society. In addition to the
major W&L bequest, he left a
one-third share of the remainder
to the Darlington School, and
one-twelfth shares to Randolph.
Macon Woman's College and to
Lynchburg College.

The bequest was announced by
W&L President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley, who remarked: “All of us
who knew Mr. Gooch both per-
sonally and as one of Washington
and Lee’s most loyal friends have
always been grateful for the
extraordinary measure of himself
he gave us during his lifetime.

“We are equally grateful to him
now for the carefully considered
ways in which he has helped to
ward the success of the cevelop
ment program in which he was
interested from the start, and the
endurance of the quality of the
university's educational programs
and physical facilities, attributes
which always meant much to
him.”

against the extra subtraction from
the SAB budget, saying “With the
schedule this year, I think the
students deserve all the parties
they can get.”

The Contact °77 speakers pro-
gram received $6700 with the
understanding that they may
come back to the E.C. if they need
more. Contact co-chairman Tom
Murphy said they may need more
cash if the Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil does not come through with
their $3000 share of the series’
cost.

Finally, the Mock Convention
received $200 which will be used
mainly to pay administrative and
ollice costs for this academic year.
The MC co-chairmen, John Trump
and Jim Lawson, had asked for
54000 in order to begin an in-
vestment program that would
boost funds for the 1980 conven-
tion. The E.C. decided, however,
that money taxed from students
this year should be spent this
year and not on an event which
most of them will not see.

The MC was left with about
$1590 in bills from last Spring’s
convention. The bills will be paid
from a $10,000 check donated by
the Summer Foundation, a Texas-
based political study group. The
bills include $400 for a reception

In a simultaneous comment, the

ning Council, Edwin A. Morris,
of Greensboro, N.C., said: “This
bequest represents a critically im-

Vol. LXXVI

The Woman’s Garden Club of
Virginia has offered a grant for
the addition of a terrace and other
landscaping to be added to Lee
Chapel.

The Club’s plans are part of
a statewide program to revisit
previous restorations and have al-
ready been accepted by the Board
of Trustees. Previous landscaping
vas done in 1933, when several
trees and shrubs were planted.

The present changes call for a
large, curved terrace in front of
the chapel, with three steps lead-
ing up to the campus, along with
the planting of trees, boxwoods
and ground cover around the
building. The walk leading up to
the Colonnade will be removed.

As nice as this sounds, the plan
is not without controversy. When
introduced to the Executive Com-
mittee Monday night, there was
a rather obvious air of displeasure
over the group when the artist’s
sketch of the landscaping was
passed around by E.C. member
Neil Pentifallo.

discussion until a later meeting,
but proposed that a survey of

Publication salary
debate postponed

By ROBERT CHIAVIELLO

At their regular Monday night
meeting the Executive Committee
decided to postpone discussion on
the issue of salaries for the edi-
tors and business managers of the
various campus publications.

E.C. Vice-president Sandy
Stradtman reported that certain
individuals, notably Bob Keefe,
director of publicity and editor of
the 1968 Ring-tum Phi, would be
unavailable because of extremely
busy schedules and that a con-
scientious decision could not be
made without their counsel. The
E.C. then passed a motion to
table the Publications Board in-
vestigation until November. They
did make it clear that the in-
vestigation would delve deeper
than just the salary issue. Both
the quality of the publications
and the method in which editors
are selected would be investigated.

President Tom Hunter opened
discussion on a report, made by
an ad hoc committee of the Uni-
versity Council, concerning recom-
mendations about the changed
relationship between the College
and the Law School.

The committee’s report recom
mended that another Law Student
representative be added to the
E.c., the three presidents of
the law classes serve on the
Student Control Committee, and
that two thirds of the tax money
collected from the Law School be
returned to the Student Bar As-
sociation.

This last proposal has already
been acted upon by the E.C.

Dave Cranshaw, law representa.
tive, said that the question of
allowing senior law students to
vote for the senior law school
representative was more  im-
portant, and that the E.C. ought
to make a decision on that matter
in time to put it on a referendum.

Also, the E.C. voted to put
before the student body a pro-
posal to change the freshman
elections from the third Monday
in October to the fourth Monday
of the Fall term. The referendum
will probably be held during the
big three elections in the winter
term.

Also, Stradtman announced that
the TV rooms of the University
Center had been vandalized and
that an investigation into the
matter would be carried out. He
asked that students be vigilant
and report any acts of vandalism
to Proctor Robert “Murph” Mur-
ray.

Finally the E.C. announced that
a poll of the student body would
be taken on the question of re-
instating the Winter break. The
survey will be taken on Thurs
day and Friday, October 14 and
15, and also the Monday of the
Freshman election October 18.

In other business the E.C. ap-
pointed nine persons to faculty
committee positions. The ap-
pointees and committees are:
Steve DiBiagio. Tom Kiegler and
Pete Williams, Athletic Commit-
tee; Freeman Jones, Brian Tray
and Trip Wornom, Health Com-
mittee, and Hugh Robinson, Jesse
O'Neil and Sean Smith, Library
Committee

 

Number 3

It had to happen! Dissatisfied with the wind-patterns beneath the footbridge, the Military Science depart-

ment has contracted for a large full-scale rapelling cliff to be built behind the campus, In order to dispel
fears of a military takeover of the campus, the project is being disguised as a library. Remember, you
read it first in the Ring-tum Phi...on second thought, forget it.

By JOHN HASTINGS

Since its founding in 1866, the
School of Law has been thought of
as a vital and cohesive part of the
W&L community. Recently, how-
ever, there have been some ques-
tions raised as to how integral a
part the Law School plays in life
at W&L.

In a recent interview Law
School Dean Roy Steinheimer dis-
pelled any thoughts of disunity,
saying he felt that the Law School
has a very definite role at the
University and that the law stu-
dents are under the jurisdiction
of Dean John just as any under-
graduate students are.

One of the main points of dis-
cussion was the possibility of a
separate Honor System for the

Law School. Steinheimer said, “T
feel that the University’s Honor
System is very applicable here at
the Law School. The standards are
the same for law students as
regular students.”

Steinheimer added that the onl:
recent changes in the Law School
are the new building and the new
location and that there are no
foreseeable changes on matters
concerning the University.

Last fall. the University Coun-
cil formed an ad hoc committee
to study the relationship between
the Law School and the under
graduate division. One of the
many suggestions that the ad hoc
committee made was that the
present Honor System be retained
as it is in the Law School.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

Thursday, October 7, 1976

Government
and The Press

The Executive Committee has tabled until sometime in
November all official discussion of a subject which is under-
standably important to all of us involved in student publica-
tions. The issue is whether or not to pay salaries to the editors
and business managers of the Ring-tum Phi and Calyx, and
to the editor of the Ariel, with money collected in the form of
the student tax.

The E.C. is looking into the matter with their usual dis-
patch. They are examining the operations of another Uni-
versity organization, the Publications Board, which is sup-
posed to have direct control over the three publications men-
tioned above, The Board is responsible for selecting editors
and business managers; it appropriates expenditures from its
own reserve fund for items deemed necessary to the publica-
tions (such as the $2,000 spent to renovate the darkroom,
lormerly a disaster area); most importantly, it stands be
tween the [.C. and student publications to insure the integrity
of what has been known historically as the “free press.”

However, according to the student body constitution, al]
Publications Board expenditures must be approved by the
student body treasurer, which means the vice-president. Ac-
the
managers of the Calyx and Ring-tum Phi are to
receive salaries of $200 and $150, plus 20% and 25% of outside

cording to the Publications Board constitution, editors

and business

(subseription and advertising) revenues, respectively. Now,
there are many good and bad arguments being offered both
for and against paying salaries to heads of student publications,
but that is a minor point. If the [E.C. is going to help fund
these publications (as they now must do, for several reasons :
we could not survive on outside revenue alone as it is cur
rently collected; all students receive the publications ree,
hence we should receive part of their tax money; the Board
of ‘Trustees tells them to), and is going to refuse to allocate
the
Publications Board reserve fund, as per its own constitution.

Rene C. McPherson

Rush can damage

By RANDY SMITH

Rush provides a lot of fun for
many students at W&L. But for
some students there is a dark side
to the proceedings that over-
shadows the carnival atmosphere.
For some freshmen, Rush is a
nightmare, a time of anxious an-
ticipation, a blow to their self-
esteem, Many take the setback in
stride and some are even openly
indifferent toward the fraternity
system. But in private, they may
feel alienated, disregarded; they
probably examine their personali-
ties for what must be a defct of
some kind (at least in someone’s
ties for what must be a defect of
mind). “What makes me differ-
ent?” they ask. “Why wasn’t I
good enough?”

There can be no doubt that go-
ing through Rush and not receiv-
ing a bid is a smite to one’s pride.

 

A bid is a symbol of acceptance in
a new and foreign environment.
To not receive a bid is to not be
accepted by social circles in this
socially-minded school.

A bid is an evaluation of worth.
How is one to react when no
evaluation—or a negative evalua
tion—is made and there is no
reinforcement o one’s worth? For
those whose worth has been qus-
tioned, a defeatist attitude is
easily taken.

People react to the letdown in
different ways. Some go _ into
seclusion and brood by themselves
for a while. Others bury them
selves in their studies and don’t
allow their minds to dwell on
“trivialities’ like bids and fra
ternities. Most find other students
in the same situation—they have
a common experience which bonds

Generals take command
Randolph - Macon defeated, 7-3

Head coach Bill McHenry called
it, “The most courageous de-
fensive performance I’ve ever
seen.” The players themselves
called it “super.” No matter how
it is referred to, the matter stands
that W&L won its first game of
the 1976 season, a hard fought 7-3
victory over conference foe Ran-
dolph-Macon. W&L is now 1-2 on
the year and 1-1 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.

The Randolph-Macon game,
played on W&L’s Wilson Field,
started in a treacherous downpour
that seemed to get progressively
worse as the game went on. The
weather minimized the capabili-
ties of both offensive units, and
was a main factor in the game’s
nine turnovers. Randolph-Macon,
now 0-3, was intercepted twice,
and fumbled six times losing four
of them. The Generals’ had three
turnovers all on fumbles.

The Randolph-Macon offense
was on the field for the majority
of the second half, running 47
plays from scrimmage to W&L’s
15. With their backs against the
wall time after time, the Gen-
erals defensive unit was more
than equal to the task. The only
Yellow Jacket score came on a
20 yard field goal by Bruce Kirk.
The General defense controlled
the game the remainder of the
way.

A key to the W&L victory,
their first over R-M since 1967,
was the punting of junior Phil
Bailey who averaged an outstand-
ing 38 yards a kick on seven
punts. Center Mark Duncan had
an excellent day snapping the ball
considering the weather condi-
tions. Linebackers Jeff Slatcoif
and Carl Foleik combined for 13
tackles and assisted on 16 others.

Game balls were awarded to
W&Ls co-captains, middle line-
backer Jeff Slatcoff and split end
Tony Perry, not only for their
performance in the game itself,
but also for their leadership
throughout the week preceeding
the game. McHenry noted, “This
win would never have been pos-
sible without the teams’ superior
mental attitude. The players
never doubted their ability to
win despite two earlier losses, and
I feel this is directly attributable
to the co-captains. Everybody
played like winners.”

While the taste of victory is
still being savored, the Generals

are spending the week preparing
for Saturday’s game with South-
western in Memphis, Tn. South-
western leads the series with eight
wins and a tie in fifteen meetings
SAM is 3-1 on the year and rid-
ing high after a 45-22 win over
Principia of Elsah, Ill. last week-
end. A win Saturday would give
Washington and Lee back to back
victories for the first time since
September of 1973 when they beat
Hamilton 29-7, and Centre 22-0 to
open the ’73 season.

For their play in the Randolph-
Macon game, junior co-captain
Jeff Slateoff, the middle line-
backer from Windber, Pa. was
named the teams’ defensive
player of the week. Slatcoff had
six solo tackles and assisted on
nine others. Sophomore Richard
Wiles, a flanker from Danville,

Va. was the Generals’ offensive
player of the week. Wiles caught
four Ted Hissey passes for 46
yards.
Leading Pass Receiver

Senior split end and co-captain
Tony Perry is now W&L’s all-time
leading pass receiver with 130
career receptions. He broke the
record of 127 held by Steve Ma-
haffey, W&L class of 1971.
Mahaffey led the nation with 74
receptions in the 1970 season.

Perry broke the mark with a
30 yard reception on a fly pattern
in the second quarter of the
Centre game on September 25th.
Ile also caught another Ted Hissey
pass against Centre, and two last
Saturday in the rain, to give him

vision, when Miss Brown was on a
year-long leave of absence under
a grant from the Council On
Library Resources Inc.

Mrs. Kondayan is a member of
several state and regional! library
associations. Among her recent
research activities has been a de-
tailed investigation of the library
holdings of Liberty Hall Academy,
Washington and Lee’s 18th-cen-
tury predecessor institution. The
result is a scholarly article which
will be published shortly in The
Virginia Magazine Of History And
Biography.

Miss Brown, whose title at
Prineeton is to be assistant uni-
versity librarian for general

reader services, will have a staff
of 45 under her direction, includ-
ing 18 professional librarians.
Among the several academic li-
braries for which she will have
administrative responsibility is
the Woodrow Wilson Library of

Princeton’s famed political science
and foreign service school.

She joined W&L’s library staff
in 1971, after seven years in the
library at Cornell University. She
is a graduate in English of lowa
State University and received her
master’s degree in library science
from Columbia. .

The Council on Library Re-
sources grant she received in 1974
was one of just five awarded in
the nation to mid-career librarians
judged to possess ‘exceptional
management potential.” She spent
her year “shadowing” Page Aker-
man, then the head librarian at
the University of California at
Los Angeles (UCLA),

Miss Brown is chairman of the
board of Shenandoah, Washington
and Lee’s literary quarterly, di-
rector of the Rockbridge Concert-
Theatre Series, and a member of
the Rockbridge Chorus. Last May
she received the “Ring-tum Phi
Award” for extraordinary dedica
tion to the university and its stu-
dent body.

selves to a house (or at least have
received a bid sometime during
the Rush process), it may be
proper for fraternity members to
give a passing thought to those
who got relatively little out of
Rush. It must be remembered that
the unsettling experience of not
receiving a bid can be a depress-
ing one and damaging to the ego.
Keep “them” in mind when you
are enthusiastically discussing fra-
ternity life with a member of

“them” passes by. It is only gentle-
manly not to abuse the self

been passed over in the social

New law scholarship established

The Berwind Corp. of Phila-
delphia has made a $25,000 gift
here to establish an endowed
honor scholarship fund in the uni-
versity’s School of Law.

The gift was made in memory
of the late Zeb Hamill Herndon,
a 1927 W&L graduate who was
vice president of Berwind and
president of its West Virginia
subsidiary, Berwind Land Corp.,
until his retirement in 1972. Mr.
Herndon died last winter.

The Berwind gift will provide
honor scholarships to outstanding
law students at Washington and
Lee who are residents of West
Virginia, with first preference be-
ing given to students from Welch,
where Mr, Herndon was born

and spent the first hal? of his life,
The new endowment will also
help Washington and Lee meet a
$150,009 challenge grant from the
Claude Worington Benedum
Foundation. That grant is design-
ated to provide financial assist-
ance to out:tanding law students
from West Virginia generally.

Ater his graduation heve, Mr.
Herndon earned his LL.B. degree
rom West Virginia University and
engaged in the private practice
of law in Welch until 1941. His
law partner was Thornton G.
Berry Jr., a fellow W&L alumnus
who is now chief justice of the
West Virginia Supreme Court of
Appeals.

Constitution-vs.-rule duel
invalidates frosh election

A conflict between the Student Body Constitution
and the rules of the Voting Regulations Board (VRB)
has led the Executive Committee to rerun Monday’s
election for freshman E.C. representative.

The election for E.C. representative will be held
today in conjunction with the run-off between Casey
O’Malley and Dave Meyer for freshman president.

The E.C. decided to hold the election again after
hearing a complaint Monday night from Jay Blum-
berg, a candidate whose name was omitted from the
ballot in the general election.

Blumberg’s name was removed because he had
allegedly failed to obey the VRB rule requiring that
each candidate give the E.C. a pledged financial state-
nent the night before tahe election.

VRB chairman Bill Kerr said he did not find
Blumberg’s statement in the E.C. room Sunday night;
however, E.C. President Tom Hunter noted that a
couple of statements were found in the trash ean
and that Blumberg’s could have been lost.

The E.C. voted to held a second election today
based on Blumberg’s pledge that he had turned in
a Statement on Sunday night. Senior representative
Paul Larkin voted against the decision. Senior repre-
sentative Walt Kelley abstained and pointed out the
Constitutional reference to elections.

Kelley mentioned that the Constitution states
that any candidate who turns in a petition to the
E.C. will be placed on the ballot. The Constitution
makes no mention of financial statements. Kelley
argued that the E.C. was overstepping its bounds by
requiring the statments.

Larkin agreed, and arranged a special meeting
of the E.C. Tuesday night to discuss the issue.

At Tuesday night’s meeting the E.C. decided to
include on today’s ballot the names of all persons
who turned in petitions regardless of whether they
had presented financial statements. The motion pass-
ed unanimously.

Today’s ballot will include the names of the two
candidates listed Monday, plus Blumberg and three
other candidates who were stricken from the ballot
in the general election.

Candidates for freshman E.C. representative in-
clude Jay Blumber, Kevin Dickey, Andy Holds, Jacob
Jones (Monday’s apparent winner), Ray Nugent and

Kelley said the E.C. will#probably look into the
question of requiring financial statments from candi-
dates. The investigation will take place sometime in
the near future and will deal with the issue of
scrap the statements, write a constitu-
tional amendment or innovate.

Erratum

In last week's issue of the

inaccurately described as presi-
dent of the Student Association

Iron-jerkers get cash

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

The W&L Weightlifting Club,
will receive a $100 gift.

At the conclusion of the Spring
term last May, J. Michael Luttig
was awarded the Gilliam Award,
created in 1963 to honor Dean
Frank J. Gilliam, now deceased.
The award consists of a silver
bowl presented to the recipient,
plus $100 to a campus organiza-
tion or department named by the
recipient. The award is given on
the basis of service to the school
and the community, rather than
in consideration of need.

In a letter to the Exective Com-
mittee, dated September 1, 1976,
Luttig thanked the EC for the
award. He said that he thought
of the award “not in terms of
an honor or distinction, but rather
as a memorial to a man whose
contributions far transcend his
years.”

Luttig took the attributes of the
Dean into consideration before
selecting the Weightlifting Club.
Dean Gilliam excelled in athletics,
student government, and com-
munity affairs. Luttig felt the field
of athletics had been largely ig-
nored in the past by other
recipients, and the enthusiasm
with which the Weightlifting Club
members approached their activi-
ties impressed him. He cited fund
raising activities, expenditures
for new equipment, and the paint-
ing of the weightroom as _ ex-
amples.

The president of the club, Ed
Wick, said the club was honored
by the unexpected award. “It
came as a complete surprise. We
weren't planning on an extra $100.
I guess we will use it to further
enhance the weightroom with any
equipment the club wants to buy.”

For students unfamiliar with
the Weightlifting Club, it is
pledged “to act as a developer in
the physical well-being of mem-
bers of the W&L community.”

Membership is open to all pro-

vided that the individual displays
an interest in improving his or
her physique through the use of
weights and related exercises. The
club provides equipment, coach-
ing, and extracurricular benefits.

Wick said the club does nothing
for students not interested in
keeping in shape, but it is in-
valuable to students who are. Club
equipment can be used by stu-
dents if a club member is present.
By painting the weightroom and
at times providing stereo music,
club members have a more con-
genial atmosphere for workouts.
Carpeting the weightroom is the
next project, but the funds for

at W&L, but first they need to
develop experience in club mem-
bers and interest by the student
body.

It has also been suggested by
one member that the club spon-
sor a “Mr. W&L Body” contest,
but Wick doubts if that idea will
ever materialize.

Trustees meet
in Philadelphia

W&L’s Board of Trustees will
meet this week in the same loca-
tion their predecessors did a
hundred years ago during the na-
tion’s Centennial — historic Inde-
pendence Hall in Philadelphia.

A ceremony tomorrow morn-
ing in the Long Gailery in Inde-
pendence Hail will mark the open-
ing of the regular autumn meet-
ing of the W&L board. The room
will be closed to the public for
the special Washington and Lee
event.

The university board met in the
Same place in October 1876 “to
organize a movement for the
better endowment” of the uni-
versity. it is because of that his-
toric connection that independ-
ence hail is being made available
to W&L to follow that precedent
on the lvvth anniversary of that
meeting.

After the commemorative cere-
mony in the Long Wailery, just
above the Assembly Room in
which the Declaration of inde-
pendence and later the Constitu-
lion were actuaily dratted and
adopted, the W&L board will con-
duct a business meeung in the
west wing of Independence huii.

The W&L Board's 18/6 meeting
in independence Haii was cailed
“Lo organize a movement, in con-
nection with the National Cen-
tennial, for the purpose of in-
creasing the endowment of Wash-
ington and Lee University by con-
tributions .. . trom all parts of
the country . an expressions
of good will towards this school
endowed by Washington and the
Revolutionary fathers, and thus
aid in making it worthy, in every
respect, of the great names it
bears.”

A large number of prominent
Americans from both the North
an dthe South participated active-
ly in the Independence Hall
meeting and in subsequent fund
rasing aciivities. They included

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, October 21, 1976

“A Larger Issue”

Someone suggested that I attempt to engage the “larger
issues” at stake here at Washington and Lee without letting
ine in on just what those issues are. Oh well, it'll be more
sporting this way.

I do not propose to define the term “university”; many
weighty tomes have already been devoted to that task, Yet
it may not be invalid to draw some general conclusions about
the nature of the structure, the techniques, and the goals of
this university in particular. ;

The division of the university into colleges is in itself :
logical procedure, provided that the categories drawn are
themselves valid, Certainly it makes sense to group together
those disciplines or fields of study which are integrally inter-
related, In the undergraduate division, the college of arts and
sciences would seem upon first examination to cover about
everything; indeed, a more logical system might be to split
1) the
college of arts and humanities, including all fine arts (the

the undergraduates into the following two schools:

visual arts, music, theatre), classics, languages, history, Eeng-
lish, journalism and probably polities and sociology as well;
and 2) the college of the sciences, including all natural and
theorectical sciences, psychology, mathematics, economics, and
all other commerce-related fields.

What? you say. How can polities be separated from
economics arid commerce? Psychology from sociology? And is
not commerce an entirely distinct area, as contrasted with both

art and science?

Given the general mutual interrelatedness between all areas
of human study, as well as the many overlappings btween and
among those areas, it may be impossible to develop a perfectly
clear division of categories. Yet the one drawn above seems to
me not without a logic of its own. Politics, as a preparation
for law or public service, is clearly humanistic in nature, while
commerce and economics serve to prepare one mainly for
participation in business and private enterprise. Psychology,
while undeniably concerned with human feeling and_ self-
knowledge, purports itself to be a scientific discipline and
should hence not resist categorization with the sciences;
sociology again seems more actively concerned with the better-
ment or at least the understanding of human social behavior,
although it is often statistical or quantitiative in procedure,
if not if nature.

After these and perhaps a few other small quibbles have
heen thoroughly resolved, the matter would seem to me to be
at an end, and we might proceed to the matter of graduate
divisions. that is, the law school, Gladly would I do this, for
that seems to me a problem worth engaging, but there are
those who will, and feel they must, detain me.

What of commerce? ery my detractors, What of business,
of industry, of matters fiseal and financial? Is not the purpose
of the university to prepare its students (clients, they might
say) for life in the “real world,” where great corporations rule
the life of America?

The distinction lies between: 1) learning about a field in
whieh one has genuine interest and ability, the mastery of
which will enable one (hopefully, admittedly not necessarily )
to pursue an occupation which is both pleasurable and profit-
able: and 2) learning how to make money,

Even if the ethics program were to include business as an
vceupation, it would not justify the existence of an entire
college devoted to fulfillment of the profit motive,

Next week, unless diverted by the seandal of student apathy
over football or some other momentous tragedy, | will discuss
the relationship of the law school to the univ ersity,

By BILL THOMSON

Three weeks ago he went to
Chicago to investigate the Cen-
tral State Teamsters Fund. Two
weeks a go he was in lowa speak-
ing to a group of high school
political science and social stud-
ies instructors. Last Tuesday,
from his office in Reid Hall, he
gave a live interview with WRNG,
at Atlanta radio station. The
next day he flew to Atlanta for
radio and TV appearances and a
speech. In addition to his teach-
ing position at W&L, he is a
national correspondent for the
Des Moines Register and Tribune.
His weekly column deals with gov-
ernment and its operations from
(as he describes it) a “common
sense” view.

Clark R. Mollenhoff is the lat-
est addition to the teaching staff
in W&L’s journalism department.
A lawyer-journalist, he was a
Harvard University Nieman Fel-
low from 1949 to 1950, an Eisen-
hower Exchange Fellow from 1960
to 1961, and Deputy Counsel and
(later) Special Counsel to Presi-
dent Nixon from 1969 to 1970. An
“investigative reporter” long be-
fore the term became fashionable,
Mollenhoff has reported on local,
state and national government in
depth for about 35 years (25 of
those years have been in Wash-
ington, D.C.).

Mollenhoff has written eight
books in the past 15 years (seven
of which have sold around 10,000
to 20,000 copies. Game Plan for
Disaster, his report on the Nixon
years, and The Man Who Par-
doned Nixon, an account of Presi-
dent Ford’s destruction of his own
credibility, both came out in
1976.

“The F ord administration
doesn’t want to discuss the book,”
said Mollenhoff after his inter-
view with the Atlanta radio sta-
tion. “It’s to well-documented and
invulnerable to argument,” he

said. The weak criticism of the
book by the Ford administration
Mollenhoff said, is that there is
nothing new in the book. The
however,

Ford people do _ not,

Mollenhoff (r) confers with Prof. MacDonald

question the facts. The Man Who
Pardoned Nixon is selling well
in this election year; it is in-its
second printing now. Mollenhoff
said he is satisfied with all of his
books, and there is nothing in any
of them that he would change.
Why did Mollenhoff choose
W&L as the university where he
would like to teach?
“Washington and Lee is a fine

 

old educational institution,” he
said. The first time he saw the
Colonnade it impressed him as be-
ing comparable with the White
House, Phe Capitol and other
great American buildings. “Com-
pared to Washington and Lee,
Harvard looks like a factory.”
“It's a good, school, and it’s
small enough that I think I'll have
some impact on the students,’
said Mollenhoff. He stresses gov-
ernment operations in class and
emphasizes the importance of
examing fact situations in order
to arrive at basic, honest judge-
ments. He said that this is a
good ability for students to culti-
vate. “It helps you get to the core
issue, and then to dismiss ir-
relevent material,” he said. “This
analysis puts you in an informed
position from which you can moke
subsequent judgements.”

Mollenhoff, in addition to writ-
ing his column and teaching, is
currently working on a “couple of
investigative projects’ (one of
which is corruption in the Teamst-
ers Union).

He will be teaching at W&L for
a two year period to see how
it turns out. He said that he en-
joys teaching and, in the next
three or four years, would like to
phase himself out of “day-to-day”
journalism: and go into full-time
teaching.

And what does the author of
The Man Who Pardoned Nixon
think of the upcoming presi-
dential election? “Ford has been
wrong in a lot of cases. He doesn’t
want to face the facts,” Mollen-
hoff said. “But I'm not sure if
Jimmy Carter is a reasonable
alternative to Ford.”

etters to the Editor

An open letter
to the IFC

Dear Sirs:

The recent decision by the IFC
(more specifically the IFC social
chairman) to engage both the
Tams and the Drifters for the up-
coming IFC weekend is outrageous
The continued callous indifference
of this school’s student leaders to
the opinions of a large portion,
if not a majority, of the student
population (in this case the fra-
ternity population) concerning
matters of social entertainment is
astonishing, especially in light of
last year’s near riot in the E.C.
room concerning the same prob-
lem.

In case the reader is not aware
of the matter in question, I will
update: in last week's Ring-tum
Phi the IFC announced that they
had contracted for two bands to
play for IFC weekend—the Tams
and Sister Rose and her Brothers
(or whatever). Subsequently, the
1FC announced that Sister Rose
was unavailable, and as a replace-
ment, the Drifters were signed to
play the SAME NIGHT as the
Tams. (Thus it seems that the true
soul music addict requires re-
peated hits of soul music in order
to achieve complete aural satis-
faction.)

Again, I must express my total
amazement—and disgust—at the
continued lack of responsiveness
of the IFC and SAB to student
cisions; Le., one soul band and
one rock band. For the sake of
desires. Thankfully the SAB has
made progress in this area
through such means as student
opinion polls and compromise de-
fariness, the IFC should follow the
lead of the SAB and poll indi
vidual fraternity members before
making decisions concerning IFC
functions. Hopefully, such pro
cedures would prevent the recur
sions, Until such a time, those of
us who have grown tired of old
men in pink tuxedos will have to
suffer through one more perform
ance of the tired Tams and the
down-and-out Drifters

Stephen Good
Bill Craver
Bill Broders

This all leads one to wonder
whether last year’s IFC and
SAB potentates were indeed
granted a full pardon by their
successors for any and all
crimes committed while in
office. History is proving itself
to be cyclical, or at least re
cyleled.

Parking problems

Editor,Ring-tum Phi:

A peaceful Saturday night's
quiet and solitude gvas broken by
the loud tearing sound created
by the ripping of a car’s conver
tible top. In the pouring rain, the
vandal slashed a gaping hole in
the roof and proceeded in his at-
tempt to steal the car. If not for
the appearance of the security
guard, the attempt could have be-
come a reality.

A typical case of crime on the
streets which occurs most every
day in cities such as Richmond,
New York, Newark, and others.
What makes this event so shock-
ing, however, is the fact that this
act of vandalism (including the
ravishing of the auto) did nto
occur in any of those crime-ridden
cities, but on the freshman park-
ing lot on the W&L campus in the
small town of Lexington, Va. This
is not to place the blame on
Murph, for if it were not for his
timely appearance, the aborted
hot-wire attempt might have been
succesful. This is not, however,
the point of this letter.

The reason that an occurance
such as this is possible to happen,
should be apparant. It is due to
the irresponsibility of the ad-
ministration, and their refusal to
furnish further parking facilities.
It should also be noted that the
Sophomore parking lot, located to
the right-rear of Gilliam Hall, is
often close to empty. Therefore,
additional parking is available. It
is irresponsible to place a pak-
ing lot as far away from the
campus and in such an obscure
location, which lends itself to
mischief, as the freshmen park-
ing lot. It is probably true that
creating a new parking lot would
involve a large expenditure (and
take until the year 2001 to com
plete) however, the personal ex
penditure which will be incurred
by such acts make such a pro
posal manditory

In a school such as W&L, where
we pride ourselves in an honor
system where such acts of vand
alism are extinct, why should we
permit such acts by outsiders to
tarnish our good name and reputa
tion”

Michael M. Adams ‘80

And let's not ferget old
Woods Creek, scene of unmiti-
gated holocaust, where the last
report it was impossible to
drive, park, and even walk. The
open space which could have
served well as a parking lot
has been given over to a colony
of boviders, and the walkways

are rivers of mud. Chalk it up
to administrative foresight.

Richard revisited
Dear Sir:

Your editorial on the salaries
for publication editors and busi-
ness managers is to the point, in
that they should be paid. Few
people realize the hassles of try-
ing to meet deadlines, and the
hell that is caught when they are
missed. The issue is freedom, free-
dom from the meddling of the
Executive Committee into an area
about which they probably know
little if anything at all. The E.C.
should return to whatever it is
supposed to be doing and leave
the publications to the Publica-
tions Board. They should also re-
read their copies of the student
handbook. Congratulations to
Mark Richard for having the
strength of his convictions.

Respectfully Yours,

Harry Wright, IV, 80A
P.S. Perhaps you should table the
Ring-tum Phi until November.

lt was actually proposed (un-
officiatiy) by one E.C. member
that the E.C. take it upon them-
selves to select the editors and
business managers of the stu-
dent publications. Seriously.
Aside from the fact that they
could never be qualified to
make such decisions, such a pro-
posal represents a further step
towards what would be called

totalitarianism anywhere else.
The danger of having an E.C.
appointee as head of the stu-
dent newspaper is obvious and
odious, and one is led to ask
whether the E.C. has any of its
favorites in other high appoint-
ed offices already.

Hampden-Sydney defeats Wé?L;
Generals prepare for Sewanee

The football Generals kick off
the second half of their 1976 sea-
son with a home contest against
the University of the South from
Sewanee, Tennessee this Saturday.
Game time is 1:30 p.m. on W&L’s
Wilson Field.

Th South, more commonly re-
ferred to as the Sewanee Tigers,
is coming off a 22-18 College
Athletic Conference (C.A.C.) win
over Southwestern, a victor over
W&L by a 28-3 score a week ago.
The Generals will be trying to re-
bound from a hard fought 15-7
setback at the hands of eighth
ranked Hampden-Sydney. The an-
nual contest against Sewanee is
one which the W&L players and
coaches look to with great an-
ticipation. The series, which
reached its high point when both
teams were members of the

Keydet Kickers
keep it close

By HEARTSILL RAGON

Virginia Military Institute beat
Washington and Lee University in
soccer action Friday afternoon by
a score of 2-1.

Fred Allner fired in a goal with
1:11 left to play in the game to
give VMI the win.

‘This goal was the second of the
day for Allner who, according to
VMI’s head soccer coach Capt. Jim
Clark, now leads the team in
total number of goals scored.

Allner scored his fifst goal with
22:30 left to play in the first half.
He caught W&L’s goalie, Mark
Bennett, offguard and kicked in
a 20-yard shot to give the Keydet’s
a 1-0 lead at the half.

W&L’s ability to control the ball
increased in the second half. With
33:44 left in the game the Gen-
erals’ Mike Monohan was able to
break away from his defender and
receive a pass from Jeff Barr to
make an easy one-on-one goal.

W&L and VMI played evenly
for the next 30 minutes and the
crowd began to talk about the
possibility of overtime. This talk
was short-lived when VMI’s Allner
came up with a surprise unas-
sisted goal that caught the upper-
lefthand corner of the goal.

With only 1:11 left to play in
the game, the Generals were un-
able to put together any scoring
attack.

W&L’s season record falls to 2-
5 while VMI's record stands a 3-5.

Coach Clark of VMI said, “It
could have worked out either
way, I’m just very happy it went
our way.”

VMI's next game is Monday
against Furman College at VMI.
W&L plays Lynchburg in Lexing-
ton Wednesday at 3:00 p.m.

C.A.C., stands at 12 victories each.

Sewanee, currently 2-3 this sea-
son, won the 1975 meeting at
home, 13-3, while the General
were victorious by a 7-0 score in
1974 on Wilson Field.

Last Saturday in Hampden-
Sydney, Va, W&L put forth a
valiant effort before succumbing
to the conference leading Tigers
of H-S, 15-7. With only eight
on a 32 yard run from scrimmage
by freshman runningback Stewart
minutes gone, the Generals scored
Atkinson, The stingy General de-
fense made the lead stand until
ten minutes remained in the third
quarter when Gary Garner booted
a 24 yard field goal for H-S. Half-
back Jimmy Ferguson gave the
Tigers a 9-6 lead just before the
end of the third quarter with a
five yard touchdown run. H-S

quarterback Bill Newell capped
the scoring with a one yard
plunge with 1:41 remaining to
play.

Hampden-Sydney, the eighth
ranked division III team in the
nation upped its season record to
5-1 and to 2-1 in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. The Generals
dipped to 1-4 overall and to 1-2 in
the conference. W&L’s lone re-
maining league game is on
October 30th at Bridgewater.

Atkinson, W&L’s leading ground
gainer, finished the game with 118
yards on 27 carries. That was the
first time a W&L back has rushed
for over 100 yards since fullback
Mercer West ran for 19 yards
against Sewanee on October 26,
1974 in a game at Wilson Field.
Atkinson’s 32 yard TD was the
first W&L touchdown scored by

rushing all season. Freshman
punter Sid Farrar had an excel-
lent day, averaging 39.5 yards on
six kicks, ineluding a 53 yarder.
The Generals came up with three
interceptions, one each by sopho-
mores Bryan Sibson and Jack
Norberg, and freshman John Mar-
tin, which set up the game’s first
touchdown.

For his play against H-S, George
Berry, a 6-3 sophomore tackle
from Charlotte, N.C. was named
W&L’s Offensive Player of the
Weekk. Bryan Sibson, the sopho-
more strong safety from Haver-
town, Pa. was voted the team’s
top defensive performer. Sibson
had eight solo tackles, three as-
sists and an interception in the
IIl-S game,

Siegenthaler discusses free press, lst Amendment

stands are never comfortable” and
that he realized the implications
of his opinion on the dismissa! of
cases. He said that in this “crime-
infested and media-saturated”
society where “change is the one
constant ... there may be people
who can’t get a fair trial.”

He said his stand on dismissal
“does create problems” but said
that it should be used only when
change of venue or postponement
of trial cannot solve the problems
of pre-trial publicity. He called
dismissal the “obvious solution”
to such problems and cited cases,
notably Daniel Ellsberg’s trial for
allegedly stealing the Pentagon
Papers, where judges dismissed
charges because of government
wiretaps.

No one suggested using the con-
tempt power against the govern-
ment officials in those cases, he
said, and he could see no reason
why the press should be “singled
out” by judges.

He suggested that when investi-
gators insist that reporters reveal
where they got a story, it is an
indication that the police and
prosecutors are not doing their
jobs.

“Reporters from time to time
abuse other rights,” he said, but
added that the number of report-
ers who have gone to jail rather
than reveal sources proves that
they will act responsibly in this
area.

Seigenthaler backed up his ab-
solute view of the First Amend
ment historically by mentioning

that the press was “semi-literate,
ungrammatical and ill-informed”
when the amendment was written.
The Founding Fathers gave the
press absolute freedom anyway,
he said.

He said the press has a re-
sponsibility to “examine and ex-
pose” without worrying about
harming the system of justice.
They have a duty to scrutinize
the police, judges, prosecutor and
defense and to “punish what, in
the reporter’s judgement, the pub-
lic needs to know.”

Seigenthaler’s speech was fol-
lowed by a question-and-answer
session that developed into a de-
bate between the- speaker and
Prof. Clark Mollenhoff.

Mollenhoff pointed out that in
the Shephard decision, a case in-
volving pre-trial publicity in a
Cleveland murder trial that
spawned the television series “The
Fugitive.” the Court found that

and is 1-2 in the conference.
0.D.A.C, member Bridgewater Col-
lege defeated W&L 15-44, while
the Generals took Virginia State
15-50. Bridgewater’s Mike Kidd
took first place with a time of
26:15 for the five mile course.
Kidd’s time was the best on the
W&L course since 1969. Junior
Allen Weeks was again the top

time of 27:40, followed by Rich-
ard Bird of Lexington at 28:07.

able mention selections.

1977 lacrosse semior co-captains,
defenseman Tom Keigler and mid-
fielder Jack Dudley, will lead the
current edtion of the Generals
against their graduated counter-
parts. Keigler was a first team

ranked seventh nationally in the
NCAA's University Division.

In a rain soaked freshman
scrimmage last Sunday, Bill Ma-
hon, a first year attackman from

(Continued from page 1)

dent Activities Board was in the
process of selecting a freshman
to sit on the board, contrary to
an E.C. motion passed at the last
meeting. No decision was reached
and members of the Curriculum
Committee then noted that they
had no desire to have a freshman
sit on their committee.

Walt Kelley requested that the
Board of Trustees be asked about
the parking situation in front of
the Woods Creek Apartments. One
concerned student and apartment
dweller added that they might
also inquire about the purpose of
the large boulders in front of the
apartments. Tom Hunter said the
matter would be brought before
the Trustees.

Dave “Radar” Davis suggested
that signs be posted in the Stu-
dent Center stating that the facili-
ties are off limits to townspeople
due to abuse of the facilities by
some young townspeople. Davis
cited an incident where a student
studying in Fairfax Lounge had
his coat stolen, presumably by a
group of young children.

the judge, not the press, was at
fault.

Seigenthaler countered that the
case had nonetheless been the sti-
mulus for the Reardon and Kauf-
man studies into “coverage of
crime ... by the media” which
suggested the “cautious” use of
the contempt power,

Mollenhoff also suggested that
a reporter waving a placard de-
claring the defendant guilty
would, under Seigenthaler’s plan,
lead to a dismissal.

Seigenthaler qualified his earlier
remarks by saying that judges
should dismiss prejudiced cases
only when the journalist involved

is doing his job as a reporter.

Mollenhoff’s closing statement
that they were in agreement
brought scattered cheers and ap-
plause from the audience. Mollen-
hoff said after the speech that he
and Seigenthaler had been argu-
ing for twenty years.

Vol. LXXVI

By RICHARD LOVEGROVE
RtP Staff Reporter

Have you ever wondered what
it would cost you if you got
caught kidnapping a freshman
from his dormitory room at W&L?

For the first two fraternities
caught kidnapping this year,

Delta Tau Delta and Phi Kappa
Sigma, the answer was $25 and
a warning. But Inter-Fraternity
Council President Alfred Robin-
son warned that any further viola-
tions by any fraternity will result
in a muen stiffer fine and some
kind of probation.

The two $25 fines for kidnapping
were among the almost $600 in
fines levied by the JFC during and
after rush this year. Only one
fraternity, Phi Delta Theta, emerg-
ed from rush without a_ fine,
according to Louis Hackerman,
the IFC Rush Chairman.

The two heaviest fines were
incurred by Sigma Chi for illegal
dorm rushing. They received a
$75 fine and a warning for the
first offense and a $100 fine and

conduct probation for the second
violation.

Members of Sigma Chi
house who are also dorm counsel-
ors were caught distributing notes
to freshmen in the dorms. The
notes thanked the freshmen for
attending an open house at Sigma
‘hi and asked them to return for
another visit. The result was a
$75 fine and a warning.

the

Later, another member of
Sigma Chi was caught in Lee

House during a period in which
fraternity members were not al-
lowed in the dorms. A $100 fine
and conduct probation ensued.

Hackerman described the first
Sigma Chi offense as “pretty
serious” and said the $75 fine and
warning was too lenient.

The IFC constitution says, “Sug-
gested penalties are: first offense,
$159 fine; second offense, $300
fine; third offense, suspension of
rushing.”

Alt Sigma Chi dorm counselors
were supposed to be distributing
the notes, according to Terry
Atwood, one of the dorm counsel-

S.A.B. request

By JIM PARKER

In a clash Monday night be-
tween the Executive Committee
and the Student Activities Board
the E.C. acceded to an SAB re-
quest.

In an 8 to 3 vote, all standing
committees were allowed to ap-
point their own freshman mem-
bers for this year. Prior to this
vote, the E.C. was in charge of
interviewing applicants for ap-
pointment to each committee.

The dilemma arose when the
SAB independently selected two
freshmen to sit on their commit-
tee and requested that no more
be added. Four other freshmen
applied, although only one ap-
peared before the EC Monday
night.

After some discussion by SAB
co-chairmen Mike Armstrong and
John Berley, a motion was offered
by EC President Tom Hunter to
allow all chairmen and cc-ohair-
men to interview applicants and

select new members.
Among the three dissenting
voters was newly elected fresh

man representative Jacobo Jnes

In other business, Vice-Presi
dent Sandy Stradtman reported
on the Faeully-EC meeting he
attended. At the meeting, a pro
a one-week winter break
poposal was passed to recommend

Friday, Dec. 17 was turned down
Exams will begin Dec. 13 and
end Dec, 18 as planned

Concerning the question ol Lee

this is not popular, then the patio
will be torn up and removed.

The Board of Trustees, which
controls the decision on renova-
tion, was persuaded somewhat by
the survey which determined that
a majority of students would
oppose work on the chapel.

It was noted by Tom Hunter
that parking next to the Woods
Creek Apartments was ruled eco-
nomically unfeasible by Univer
sity President Robert Huntley

Jim Underhill proposed a mo
tion by which third year law stu-
dents would vote for upperclass
law representatives, as is the case
now. This was rejected 6 to 5.

Another motion was put forth
by Paul Larkin to disenfranchise
the third vear law students. The
motion passed 6 to 5. Senior Law
Representative Dave Crenshaw
brought up the issue to clarify
the voting situation.

In other business, the EC voted
by acclamation to arrange for the
execution of former RtP news
editor, Joe Fitgerald. The issue
came up when Cold Check Com
mittee chairman Bob Couch asked
how one would go about closing
EC committee appointment hear
ings, an act forbidden by the Stu
dent Body Constitution,

An EC member said one would
have to either pass a constitu
tional amendment or hang Fitz

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 28, 1976

Rush violations exposed

ors who is a Sigma Chi. He added
that all seven of the Sigma Chi
dorm counselors probably were
not involved though.

The letters were hand-written
and hand-delivered, according to
Atwood. He said no one in Sigma
Chi really saw it as a violation
of the IFC rules.

Atwood said he thinks Sigma
Chi will appeal the ruling, but
added that the rush chairman
will have to make that decision.
“T still don’t see it as a rush
violation,” he said.

According to the IFC consti
tution, “No dormitory counselor
may engage in rushing activities
in the dormitories.”

Dean Lewis G. John said he
feels the fine was fair. He said
the Student Activities Committee
approved the fine, but added that
he thought the committee was
unaware of the suggested fines in
the IFC constitution.

The incident was investigated
and, according to Dean John, it is
felt that such violations were not
widespread among dorm counse
lors.

Robinson said that stiffer fines
than the one the Sigma Chi’s re
ceived are provided for, but
stressed that both the Judicial
Board and the SAC decided the
penalty was fair.

Fines for rush violations are set
by the Judicial Board. It consists
of the IFC president, vice-presi-
dent, secretary, treasurer and
rush chairman and a senior justice
and two junior justices. Their de-
cision is then reviewed by the
SAC.

In reference to the second
Sigma Chi violation, Terry At-

wood said he thought the indi-
vidual caught had just forgotten
that he was not supposed to be
in the dorms.

$300 of the remaining fines
were levied for returning fresh-
men late from rush events and
were spread fairly evenly among
the houses. Too many fraternity
members at rush tables in the
quad resulted in $30 in fines.

New gym ruled out
for Winter concert

By NEWS STAFF

The Student Activities Board
has dramatically reduced _ its
Winier concert plans after being
denied in its request to use the
new gym for the event.

The request went through the
dean of students office but was
turned down by the athletic de
partment.

The SAB requested the use of
the new gym because of its 3500
plus seating capeaity

The concert is planned for a
weekend with no conflicts at sur
rounding schools, so a large draw
and successful event would be ex
pected

The department's reason for the

denial was that the date the SAB

requested is the day before a
basketball game and the team
needs to practice under game

conditions. The old gym was ruled
out because the floor is not as
good and shooting from the corn-
ers is more difficult.

Head Basketball coach Verne
Canfield did say that he would
shorten practice so the SAB could
have the new gym by 5:30 in the
ifternoon. The SAB turned down
this consession, saying they would
need the gym by noon to set
up sound end lighting equipment

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, October 28, 1976

Good, Bad & Ugly

The Good: Last year we had guaranteed copy for the
editorial page whenever we found ourselves with a last minute

 

shortage. Someone would sit down and write an editorial
saying that the E.C. was all to hell. The writer was usually
right.

This week, however, we are forced to admit that the mem-
hers of our governing body have done something almost
commendable. They have trashed the rule that candidates for
office must turn in financial statements before the elections
or be stricken from the ballot.

(In the past the only debate that rule has caused was a

short war in the E.C. room over whether the correct word was

“struck” or “stricken. )

It was a fine rule. It kept the candidates honest by making

them pledge before the balloting that they had complied with
the regulations concerning campaign expenditures, There's
only one catch. Neither the spending limits nor the financial
stateménts are allowed by the constitution, a fact Paul Larkin
brought up in calling a special meeting for last Tuesday to
correct the inconsistency.

We applaud Mr. Larkin and his colleagues who voted to
repeat the election contested because of these problems. We
hope they stick to their adherence to the constitution. We will
be waiting if they don't.

The Bad: The old gym? But, seriously now, fellas, where
is the Winter concert going to be held?

We attribute rumor status to any outrageous stories that
a gym almost big enough for a respectable keg-party—well,
maybe a pony keg—is going to be used for a decent-sized
concert. The stories are merely some coach’s practical joke
they have to be.

There is a question of priorities here. Are athletics, specifi-
cally basketball, more important than student entertainment ?
Or, put another way, is the typical W&L man more interested
in being entertained or being athletic? Maybe that’s not the
exact issue at hand, but we are sure that the true one will be
chosen soon by the student body,

Considering that the only question last year explosive
enough to slice through the strata of student apathy was the
Great Lexington Spinners War of 1976, we have little doubt
that we will hear more of this alleged concert in the old gym.

The Uguly: Fraternity membership has its advantages
and disadvantages. One of the disadvantages is that frat men
have to put up with the Khaki Khonspiracy to an even greater
extent than independents. These people have supposedly taken
over the LFC social positions and are working on reducing
the stigma of a rush violation. No longer will certain infrae-
tions be viewed as harassment and entrapment, They will be
considered henceforth simply as collegiate pranks.

Something smells when dorm counselors quit being sur-
rovate daddys and start playing recruiter, The odor is over-
whelming when they keep their jobs after being caught. \nd
when the penalty for the offending frat is less than the ma
mum after the second violation, a good fumigation is in order
We are beginning to wonder what is beng protected when

The Law School

lhe removal of W&L's only full graduate division, the
hool of law, from Tucker to Lewis Hall has sharpened the
lines of definition between the graduate and undergraduate
schools. Logistics now dictate a -spatial and temporal division

between “them” and “us.” The law students not only have
their own separate facilities, but facilities which are in many
ways superior to the undergraduates’, at least from a tech
nological viewpoint, No more can we expect to see W&L’s only
full-time female students lounging about on the front lawn
(and just what did happen to those nice white chairs’); we
are no longer faced with semi-pro competition when litigat
inw over a place to sit in the Co-op, So just how are the two
divisions related ?

Recently, it was suggested that the law school should form

own Executive Committee for the purpose of hearing honor

Pinball wizardry rampant

By BILL THOMSON

They stand, sometimes for hours
on end, with backs curved for-
ward, fingers twitching, feet plant-
ed firmly on the carpeted floor,
hips swaying forward and from
side to side in desponse to the
movements of the machines they
caress, and eyes focused intently,
through intervening sheets of
plate glass, on erratic silver balls
that seem to move with wills of
their own. Occasionally — they
stomp their feet, shout and throw
harmless insults at each other.
Rows of spinging digits roll up
ever-changing scores, colored
lights flash over plastic and metal
landscapes, and the sounds of
bells and buzzers intermingle in
sporadic bursts.

“They” are students, and “they”
form a group that, although it can
not be termed a counterculture,
ean at least be classified as a
special interest group. Assembl-

ing several times a day en masse, _

usually in the fternoon and at
night, the amorphous group in-
tently plugs quarters into pin-

ball machines with the objectives
of beating the odds, scoring free
games and having fun.

Evidence indicates that mem-
bership in the group can become
expensive (this, of course, de-
pends on the individual). The ma-
chines, according to Marshall
Sumner, head manager of the
Cockpit and the adjoining game
room, take in an average total of
over $400 a week. A lot of
quarters.

The game room contains 11 pin-
ball machines, two foosball ma-
chines, five pool tables, one air
hockey table and one comput-
erized baseball game. These games
have spawned a somewhat pe-
culiar language which is unique to
W&L pinball aficionados,

“Nice gape!” (an unfortunate
mistake).

“You drained it!” (ball went
down middle or side exit),

“Double  bone-aiii!” (double
bonus).

“Triple bone-aiii!” (triple
bonus). :

1976-77 season.

Morath will bring to Lexing

ton his purview of America dur-
ing the turn of the century in
his new one-man show, “The Rag

Morath’s show not only ex
plores ragtime piano music, but
offers songs by Bert Williams,
Irving Berlin, and other ragtime
ivricists, some famed and some

forgotten. Morath further sue

ceeds in bringing the period to
life with his humorous insights
into the history of the time

As an interpreter of the Ameri
can past, Max Morath first gained
national attention in the 1960's,
with twe award-winning series for
television dealing with the rag-
time era. In 1969, he launched in
New York the theatrical review,
‘Max Morath at the Turn of the
Century.” A national tour fol-
lowed, and critical acclaim was
unanimous. Walter Kerr of the
New York Times said: “Sheer de
luht! You'll find Max Morath a
deleetable companion.”

the-ball-hosed-again!” (this one is
self-explanatory, and must be
gasped in an exasperated, emo-
tion-choked voice).

Sumner said that the game
room, which opened with the stu-
dent center in 1969, began featur-
ing pinball machines in 1972 after
a number of student requests. The
popularity of the machines has re-
mained constant over the years,
in contrast with the fluctuating
popularity of the pool tables from
year to year, he said.

The machines, Sumner said, are
in the game room under contracts
with two Roanoke vending com-
panies, which divide control of
the machines about equally. The
approximate gross average of $400
a week is divided on a 50-50
basis between the vending com-
panies and the Cockpit. Some of
the pinball money from last year
returned to the game room in the
form of new carpeting, which was
installed this past summer.

Problems such as beer-drinking
in the game room, non-students
using the machines and break-ins

are “no! so much of a problem
now.” Sumner said. (‘Te said the
last break-in was two years ago).

In any ease, pinbdall is alive and
thriving at W&L.

In addition of several new ma-
chines in the game room this year,
a computerized hockey-type game
has been added to the Cockpit.
With a couple of old songs by
the Tams and the Showmen now
on the juke box, students can
play computerized hockey (which
bleeps every time someone scores)
and listen to oldies while eating
their sandwiches. Imagine the
scene as two students crouch over
the television-like sereen, mani-
pulating little levers and anxi-
ously following the trajectory of
the “ball” with their eyes. The
Showmen’s ‘'39-21-46” is playing
softly in the background.

Bleep. Bleep.

A taste of the action: Varsity stickmen find out what it’s like to face the best in lacrosse as their former
teammates outmanuver them en route to a 15-10 victory. The score was neither surprising nor disappoint-
ing, however—the W&L alumni lacrosse team is about the best anyone will ever have to face.

—Photo by Bates

Alum Stickmen defeat varsity

Dave Warfield, W&L class of
1975, brought back memories of
his playing days when he was a
second team All-American by scor-
ing four goals and assisting on
two others in leading the alumni
team over the varsity lacrosse
squad, 15-19. The rain-soaked ex-
hibition provided an opportunity
for the followers of W&L lacrosse
to see the individuals who will
represent the Generals this spring
in action, as well as seeing some
of the graduated All-Americans

who they had heard so much

about.

Ted Bauer, a former first team
All-American graduating in 1974,
hed three goals for the alumni, as
did Rob Morgan, W&L ’76. Bryan
Chasney, W&L ’74, had two goals
and three assists for the alumns.

The varsity stickmen were led
by attackmen Chris Kearney and
John Black each with two goals
and an assist. Midfielder Bob Flen-
nery and attackman Charlie Stieff

each had two goals. Co-captain
Jack Dudley had a goal, while co-
captain Tom Keigler had an assist
and played a strong defensive
game. Both Skeet Chadwick and
sill Hoatson saw time in the net
for the alumni team, while Charlie
3rown, Bill Cole, and Julian
Goode split the goalkeeping for
ihe varsity.

The Generals open their 1977
spring season on March 5th with
a home game against Duke Uni-
versity.

Independents, football, tennis
highlight imtramural season

By MICKEY KNAPP

Intramural football, golf and
tennis have been in full swing at
WAL this fall. With fraternity,
independent and facully teams
competing, the action has been
exeiting and the competition has
been intense. The regular season
schedule has been completed in
colf and football and playoff
games are to begin this week,

A wrinkle has been added to
this yeu'’s race for the overall
Intramural points championship
and trophy with the addition of
the independent “Grandstanders. '
For the first time in many years
an independent team has formed
which will carry over from one
sport to the next. In previous
years independent teams have
been formed to compete in one
IM sport or another, but have

invariably split up at the end of
a particular season. But this year’s
Grandstanders, organized and led
by varsity wrestling captain Jim
Crytzer, will stay together as a
group throughout the year. They
believe that they have a solid shot
at the overall IM championship,
and their playoff berths in both
football and golf indicate that
they may very well give the tradi-
tionally powerful fraternity teams
a run for their money.

This year’s IM football field has
been dominated by three teams:
Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa Sigma
and Phi Delta Theta. All three
were undefeated during the
regular season and all look to be
strong in the playoffs. Pika’s big
red machine rolled through its
schedule led by quarterback Jim
Fisher and linemen Jamie Vardell

and Bob Sundberg. The Phi Kapps,
going for their third stright IM
championship, once again have a
strong offense which revolves
around the passes of quarterback
Joe MeMahon to wide receiver
Ben Johns. Middle guard John
Gordon leads their defense. The
Vhi Delts have been surprisingly
strong this year. Wide receiver
Tom Pritchard may be the best
in the league at his position but
it is the team’s overall strength
which has been itsm ost im-
pressive feature.

This year’s tennis program has
been conducted under the capable
instruction of head official Jim
Houston. The top teams in this
year’s competition include Phi
Psi, Pika, SAE, Law, and the
faculty team. The faculty did not
participate in last year’s IM
tennis, but have come back with
a strong team this year. Last
week's player of the week Dr,
John Winfrey and undefeated Dr.
Thomas Vinson have been the
standouts of the league along with
Bill Keasler of Law. Due to the
large number of teams signed up
this year, and the many rainy fall
days which have forced cancella-
tions, the regular season has not
been completed and the playoffs
will not begin until the end of
next week,

Generals down Sewanee

On the strength of a rewarding
16-14 victory over the University
of the South last Saturday on
W&L’s Wilson Field, the football
Generals are now 1-0 in the sec-
ond half of the ’76 season. If the
team can win three of their re-
maining four games, the Generals
will finish the year with a 5-5
record. The 1967 W&L team finish-
ed at 5-4, and was the last foot-
ball squad to finish at .500 or
above. The Generals 2-4 overall,
have won two of their three home
games to date, but are still wait-
ing for their first road victory.

The team has their ione remain-

ence, the rivalry will. be renewed
this weekend.

Head coach Bill McHenry called
the game against Sewanee “a
super defensive effort.” Continu-
ing, McHenry noted, “Our six
interceptions were the key to the
game. Sewanee threw the ball
forty-three times, but their six
turnovers proved fatal. Our de-
fensive unit performed admirably,
and the offense showed spark at
times. This win will not only serve
to booster our confidence, but it
also gives us momentum as we
prepare for our final four games.”

Norberg intercepted three Tiger

left to play in the half.

With a scoreless third quarter,
Atkinson again put the Generals

enterprise and competition as
institutions which enable Ameri-
cans to prosper. Inflation and un-
employment won’t go away over-
night, but the suecess Gerald Ford
has had with bringing inflation
under control is astonishing—
even more so considering the

given him a realistic of view of
what is possible within govern-
ment and what is not. Camelot
and the Great Society serve as
empirical evidence that spending
and public programs per se are
not panaceas for economic ills.
The record shows just the op-
posite. The anti-Washington candi-
date proposes new programs, arti-

Congress. Ford’s experience has ‘*": ; _

tions” while Ford takes a difficult
political stance, but one with
sound economic underprinnings.
He makes no promise, he just asks
that we look at the record.

Ford neither wants to, nor will
he, neglect unemployment. In the
last 17 months, four million new
jobs have been created, yet the
labor force has increased, so these
gains do not show up in the rate
of unemployment. Carter’s sup-
port of the Humphrey-Hawkins
bill invites disaster and repudi-
ates recent history.

America will always need a
strong defense, whether in times
of war or peace. Most presidents
have realized this and Ford is no
exception. Since coming to office
and throughout his legislative
career, he has always viewed this
as our number one priority. It

is so easy to decry defense spend-
ing: the fat general and the cor-
rupt Lockheed official have been
all too visible. A state governor
who does not perceie the stakes
of the international situation can
exploit these images. But no one
can argue that the country 1s at
peace, with no Americans fighting
or dying on foreign soil. The re-
spect other nations have for the
United States is in part due to
the honest leadership of Gerald
Ford.

spiralling inflation, an ever de-
creasing Gross National Product,
increasing costs of medical care,
housing, food, energy and educa-
tion as well as the deteriora-
tion of our cities, it is little
wonder that Americans are look-
ing for new leadership. The Ford
Administration has shown itself
to be little more than a classic
example of negative government,
exhibiting a lack of initiative in
solving the nation’s problems.
Rather than take steps to solve
problems such as unemployment
and inflation, the Ford Admini-
stration has vetoed nearly every
piece of Congressional legislation
designed to remedy the troubled
economy.

It should not surprise anyone
that the present “media blitz” be-
ing conducted on behalf of the
President has not made any ref-
erence to significant accomplish-
ments by Ford. Rather, it has
mainly consisted of disparaging
remarks directed at Jimmy
Carter’s record as governor of
Georgia. The reason: Gerald Ford
simply has not accomplished any-
thing notable since he has been
president.

On November 2, the American
masses will be given the opportun-
ity to choose their next quadren-
nial leader. If the electorate wants
a government which is in effective,
and insensitive to the economic
needs of this country as well as
a government which is ineective,
incompetent, and bureaucratically
wasteful, then Gerald Ford will
be given an electroral mandate on
Tuesday. On the other hand, if
the American people wish to have

foreign policy, then Jimmy Carter
will be elected President.

The choice seems to be very
clear—-government based on in-
action and non-initiative, or a
government determined to restore
faith through action and _pro-
ductivity. Therefore, as the fami-
liar campaign slogan muses, “For
America’s Third Century, Why
Not Our Best?”

NOVEMBER 4, 1976

America 1, WéL 0

The National Affairs Desk
went through a serious short-
circuit early Wednesday, soon
after California announced its
finals. It is suspected that he
mistook the blasting at the li-
brary construction site for can-
nons being fired by outraged

An Election...

Somewhere around 4 a.m.
Wednesday, the nation got its
latest President. There may have
been some joy over the fact in
some parts of town, but at W&L
the majority were probably not
extremely happy. Some people are
celebrating Carter’s win and
others are showing signs of deep
despair. Most of the people are
somewhere in between: a quick
informal pall of selected per-

E.C. reviews elections;

subcommittees report

By ROBERT CHIAVIELLO

In a quiet session the Executive
Committee heard reports from the
various E.C. sub-committees and
discussed voting regulations for
future elections.

Paul Larkin, senior E.C. rep,
brought up for discussion the
question of disenfranchising sen-
ior undergraduates and third year
law students from the big three
elections. Last week the E.C.
voted to prohibit third year law
students from voting for the E.C,
law representative. No action was
taken.

Dave Cranshaw made a motion
to reorganize the Student Control
Committee. He proposed that the
president and vice president of
the Student Association, who now
serve on the SCC, be replaced
with the three law class presi-
dents. The motion passed unanim-
ously.

In further business the E.C,
heard a report from the Student
Activities Board. Co-chairmen
Mike Armstrong and John Berley
reported that Homecoming was all
set to go and that Fancy Dress was
taking form. They also reported
that the Film committee had been
doing better than expected and
that there were no definite plans
for the Winter concert yet.

The Curriculum committee re-
ported that it was in the process
of gathering information on a pre-
calculus course, and also trying
to gain faculty support since they
fecl such a course is needed. They
also said that a survey of courses
by the students will be taken the
week of February 13.

Finally the E.C. voted not to
submit the petition to change the
exam schedule because of a lack
of support. Only 550 people signed
the petition.

sons—any that would come near
the reporter—showed that most
of the people on the hill this
morning (Wed.) are either happy
with the fact, or resigned to it.
The heavy emotion came last
night.

The heavy opinion came down
on the absentee ballots that have
been floating through the Post
Office in the past couple of weeks.
The strong feelings also showed
on last week’s RtP straw poll.

eS

“Great!!! We got a choice be-
tween corporate fascism and a
welfare state.”

Now I'll admit that the guy who
said that is a serious alcoholic
with homicidal tendencies. Ill al-
so acknowledge that this is the
time of the decade when we
should be burying hostilities and
pretending to love whoever won
for at least two weeks. But when
1 heard that comment from a
student looking over his absentee
ballot, I knew I would wind up
using it somewhere. So there it
is: a comment on choice in an
article about W&L’s choice.

And considering that every-
one has printed or broadcast these
poll results by now except us, I
can't think of a better way to
begin this article. Now that I
do have it off to such a roaring
start, the best fact worth start-
ing with seems to be that the
faculty cast 24 votes for Jimmy
Carter and 1 for Lester Maddox.
Not bad. The faculty vote saves
a lot of time for the writer—there
is absolutely nothing to say about
it. The vote says it all.

Notes &¥@ Events

Exhibit
ibi

Scale models of 22 of Leonardo
da Vinci's most important draw-
ings will be on display in duPont
Gallery for two weeks beginning
Monday, Nov. 8.

The models include both practi
cal and theoretical devices.
Among them are a paddle-wheel
ship, an idea not successfully de
veloped until the advent of steam
power in the 19th century; a
theoretical gear system that pro-
duced three speeds, as in the mod-
ern automobile transmission; and
a device for determining the
tensile strength of wrie, informa
tion essential to the engineer of
five centuries ago and today.

Other models include da Vinci's
flying ship, a helicopter, a Ma
chine gun, a printing press and a
two-level bridge.

The models are on a tour under
the sponsorship of IBM, which ac
quired them in 1951. They are dis
played with panels of explanatory
material and sketches reproduced
from da Vinci's notebooks.

The gallery will be open daily
from 9 a.m. through 4 p.m.

Calyx

Phe final make-up day for Calyx
underelass formal portraits is to-

Chapel at 6 p.m

Prof. Tsai-ping Liang is re
carded as the foremost performer
med composer for the cheng, an
instrument similar to the zither

consisting of 16 strings stretched

box. Silk strings were orginally
used on the cheng, but brass
strings have been common since
about 1500,

Born in northern China in 1911,
Liang is a graduate of Peiping
University. He moved to Taiwan
in 1959. He has given concerts in
countries all over the world, from
southeast Asia to Europe.

His program will consist of
traditional Chinese music and
music of Liang’s own composi-
tion. He has written more than
40 songs for the cheng and his
book “Music of Cheng’ is in its
fifth edition.

Scholarships

Two W&L students have been
selected to receive the Lewis Kerr
Johnson Commerce Scholarship,
awarded annually by the School
of Commerce, Economics and
Politics.

The two are Jerry M. Baird of
Fort Warth, Tex., and Steven C.
Yevich of Richmond. Baird, a
junior, was selected for the first
time. Yevich, last year’s recipient,
had his scholarship renewed.

The Lewis Kerr Johnson Com-
merece Scholarship was created in
1974 in honor of Dr. Lewis K.
Johnson, professor of administra-
tion at W&L from 1933 and
former head of the department.

Lecture

“Access to the Media: Free-
Speech Rights in Conflict” will be
the topic of a lecture next week.

Dr. Franklyn S. Haiman, pro-
fessor of communication studies
and urban affairs at Northwestern
University, will speak in duPont
\uditorium Tuesday, Nov. 9, at
7:30 p.m

Articles by Halman on speech
and constitutional rights have
twice won awards from the
Speech Communication Associa-
tion. His article, “Speech vs. Pri
vary: Is There a Right not to be
Spoken to?” was cited by the
United States Supreme Court in
one of its decisions. He is also
the author of a number of books,
including “The Dynamics of Dis-

eussion” and “Freedom of
Speech.” He was editor of “To
I'yotect These Rights.” a six

volume series published this year

Haiman is the founder and
former chairman of the Speech
Communication Association's com
mission on freedom of speech and
was a member of the national
board of directors of the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union

His visit is sponsored by the
i'niversity Center In Virginia and
the W&L Enelish department

The student body went over-
whelmingly for Ford—65.4% of
the ballots. Carter took 25.2% of
the vote.

The interesting part of the poll
comes in the breakdown of votes
by class and school. Ford took
78.9% of the C-school, and 62%
among students in the College.

Among seniors the loser won
57.6%; juniors, 641%; sopho-
mores, 69.8%; and freshmen,
73.3%.

The class difference is a sub-
ject worthy of discussion that we
have neither the time nor the
space to print here. It could have
been parental influence, it could
have been the fact that the CRs
have more members in the frosh
and sophomore classes, or it may
have been, as one professor
theorized, that people really are
learning something here.

WLUR election coverage again
fastest, most accurate in area

The following article is ex-
cerpted from a full-length fea-
ture by Ring-tum Phi staff
writer Randy Smith. The editor
regrets that due to limitations
of space, the article could not
be printed in its entirety.

WLUR’s election night coverage
started at 5 o'clock Tuesday eve-
ning with a two-hour tape of
predictions state by state. Live
coverage of the election started
at 7:00 from Studio A anchored
by Seott Thomas, WLUR’s co-
ordinator of the entire project.

But the most important aspect
of the coverage, the reports on
the sixth district, was taking place
in Studio B, where Brad Elliott
was assembling information from
25 reporters “in the field” through-
out the district. WLUR prides it-
self on their coverage of the 6th
district election results, claiming
to be “eonsistently first in re-
porting sixth district returns.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, November 4, 1976

Politics

| find myself in the equivocal position of writing before the
national election an editorial which will appear after the whole
affair has been decided. Predictions, then, are of little value
(they probably are anyway); I don’t know yet to whom con-
gratulations and condolences are to be offered, Nor do I know
whether to maintain a positive hope for change or simply re-
sign myself to the status quo, that is, a continuation of the slow
deterioration of a nation.

The results of the presidential straw poll conducted by the
Ring-tum Phi contained few surprises. The largely conserva-
tive student body, led by the Commerce School, opted for Mr.
Ford by a substantial margin. The faculty, on the other hand,
voted overwhelmingly in support of Mr. Carter. As one pro-
fessor put it: “That's what happens when you get educated.”

The poll, it may be argued, was not truly representative of
University opinion, Yet the methodology was reasonably ob-
jective and the sampling taken, while limited, represents pro
portionately more of the University community than that of
most such polls, I believe that some valid conclusions may be
drawn.

On the basis of age alone, the results might seem at first
to be the reverse of normal expectations. Ford's appeal is large-
ly to financially established middle- and upper middle-class
professionals—the “Establishment” set, our parents, for ex-
ample. Carter (and Mondale) have appealed to groups gen-
erally associated with liberal or, leftist ideals, as per Mondale’s
voting record in the Senate and Carter's own iconoclastic phil-
osophies. The lowered voting age should, in theory, help Car-
ter’s cause. Yet here and elsewhere in Virginia (Longwood,
Randolph-Macon and other schools), Ford won decisively
among students, while academicians, unlike most other profes-
sionals. have been traditionally liberal on public issues, and at
least here have indicated strong pro-Carter support,

Without making qualitative judgments, | think it fair to
say that the student body at W&L is far from average when it
comes to political philosophy. Instead of being a typically re-
bellious, liberal, socially concerned group of young seekers, it
is a body of mannered, conservative, fiscally oriented future
leaders. There’s probably nothing inherently wrong with
that. I just wonder what is it I'm being left out of.

| did not vote. Until too late | remained apathetic, uncon-
cinved that my vote could make a difference and unconvinced
of the worth of either candidate. That I regret. But—win or
lose--I am not sorry to have given my “dying voice” to Mr.
Carter, and not sorry to be disassociated from the mainstream

of Washington and Lee political opinion,

Seigenthaler speaks out

by DAVID W. TALLEY, JR.

John Seigenthaler, publisher of
the Nashville Tennessean, was in-
terviewed on October 19, 1976.

RtP: Are you advocating unlim-
ited freedom of the press?

S: Yes, that’s what I think the
first amendment of the Constuit-
tion is about. When the founding
fathers said Congress should pass
no law abridging freedom of the
press, they meant that.

RtP: The problem is that the
press has a tendency to sensation-
alize and saturate the public. Is
the purpose for this to sell pap-
ers?

S: Not really, but that is a com-
mon public misunderstanding
about the press. For example, I
would say that there is no crime
that’s been committed in my com-
munity since I’ve been a reporter
that ever sold enough newspapers
to make it worth overplaying or
sensationalizing. There are still a
few cities, like New York and
Chicago, where headlines may sell
tabloid newspapers. In most cities
in America, habit, not headlines,
sells newspapers.

I reject the concept that head-
lines sell news. The truth is that
the press just sometimes makes
mistakes; this is nothing new. The
founding fathers envisioned that
the press would make mistakes,
but even while there would be
harm from the mistakes, the
greater harm was to give some
agency of government control
over the press.

RtP: I would think that there
needs to be some type of control,
perhaps self-imposed, to keep
things from getting out of hand;
such as the saturation by the me-
dia of things like hijacking and
assassination attempts.

$: There is a lusty, activist, poli-
tical press in this country. I think
the press is fairer, more objective,
more reasoanble today. Reporters
are more informed, aware, and
balanced. Even so, the potential
for harm is there. The potential
for greater harm is in giving any
government agency the right to
cut off that lusty press. When you
suggest self-imposed restraint, |
support that. I believe that it is
really demonstrating simple fair-
ness and equity to those about
whom things are said. There is an
obligation te do that, not accord-
ing to law, but morally and ethic-
ally.

RtP: Do you, as publisher, de-
cide the self-restraints on your
paper?

S: We have standards which
have evolved over a long period
of time that I continually review
with the staff, and I take respon-
sibility for those standards.

RIP: How does your paper de
cide which side of an issue or
which candidate it is going to sup-
port?

S$: We have an editorial board
which meets with me every morn-
ing, and we discuss the news of
the day and try to develop a con
sensus. We also have certain
guidelines which are set out in
the will of the man who bought
the paper in 1937, and whose fam-
ily stil owns it, having to do with
the newspaper's identity and edi
torial policy. He wanted it to be
progressive, by his standards, so
we have that tradition to follow

RtP: In the area of confidentia-
lity of sources, how is the reader
supposed to simply accept that a
“high-placed” or “unimpeachable”
source is really reliable”

S: it is a difficult problem, and
I think that responsible people
lean away from the practice of it
when they can, when a story re
lies on unnamed sources, I recom-
mend that people read the story
with skepticism.

RIP: From your

speech last

night, I gathered that your stand
is that the sixth amendment
ment should remain, but not in
such a way that it infringes on the
first amendment.

S: That’s exactly what I think.
In a few cases, the Supreme Court
has said that pre-trial publicity
may be inherently prejudicial. I
don’t accept that thesis; I believe
there are ways to get fair trials
even when there is publicity about
the case. But, because of those
few cases, judges around the coun-
try are imposing “gag rules” and
sending reporters to jail. My posi-
tion is that the only option is to
stop sending reporters to jail. It
cures nothing. It doesn’t stop him
from publishing his story, and his
paper more often than not goes on
to back him up. My theory is that
if the constitutional right of a free
trial is inhibited by pre-trial pub-
licity being inherently prejudicial,
and I believe it is not, then the
answer is to free the accused. I
think the effect of that is going to
make the press much more re-
sponsible.

Tm not calling for wholesale
dismissal of cases because report-
ers write about trials. I'm saying
that I don’t think that reporters
writing about trials necessarily
prejudices a jury in a community,
or if it does, that can be cured
without the contempt power being
exercised. In those cases, it would
be better for the courts to not vio-
late the first amendment, but to
protect the defendant's right to a
fair trial and dismiss the case
against him as they did in the

Generals make W&XL history

by J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

From the opening kickoff, W&L
looked on the verge of running
away with the game. Though this
never happened, the Generals did
play well enough to capture their
third win of the season.

Bridgewater won the toss and
elected to receive. They fumbled
the kickoff and W&L gained pos-
session of the ball within 30 yards
of the goal. The offense could
only move the ball to the 8 though,
and Dan Thompson booted a field
goal with 12:21 remaining in the
first quarter.

Though the offense received a
break early in the game, the de-
fense didn’t. They didn’t seem
mentally prepared for Bridgewat-
er (who were 0-6 going into the
game) in the first quarter as the
Eagles drove 70 yards down Jop-
son Field for a touchdown, and
leaving 6:50 on the clock.

The rest of the first half was

marked by good defense from
both teams. W&L’s defense gave
up little yardage while the offense
gained little. Our running attack
was slowed considerably as the
Eagles’ defense keyed on fresh-
man running back Stew Atkinson.
Quarterback Ted Hissey was able
to move the ball somewhat
though, through his passes, but it
only culminated in a missed field
goal from the 13 before time ran
out in the first half.

The second half saw a rejuv-
enated offense and defense come
out of the W&L locker room. W&L
returned the kickoff to their own
28 yard line and through the use
of a strong passing attack, short
yardage, runs, and_ well-timed
draw plays, the offense marched
72 yards down the field. Atkinson
plunged in for the score from the
one yard line, with 9:27 left in the
third quarter. It was evident that
the momentum of the defense had
also shifted as they held Bridge-
water to negative passing yardage
in the second half. Bridgewater
could not generate any offense
whatsoever, thanks to our defense.

W&L’s offense controlled the
ball for 20 minutes of the second
half, but even though our offense
had the ball most of the half, they
couldn’t find the handle to score.
We were inside their 10 yard line
twice in the second half and
couldn’t score a TD, and because
of Thompson’s hurt leg, we
couldn’t kick a field goal.

W&L did manage to score one
more time as Hissey again went to
work, completing a 40 yard pass
to Tony Perry and then an 8-yard
pass to Curis Walsh for the TD.
Fans then had a rare opportunity
to see Perry attempt the extra
point—and miss. The game ended
16-7.

Hissey ran the offense with his
superb passing as he completed 17
of 25 passes with 2 interceptions,
for 200 yards. Atkinson (though

still leading the backs) was held
to 2.3 yards per carry, but was in-
strumental in gaining tough yard-
age on key downs. Tony Perry had
his best game of the year as he
caught 6 passes for 75 yards, and
Rich Wiles also did a fine job re-
ceiving 4 passes for 40 yards.

But our hats should go off to
the defense who held the Eagles
to 142 yards total offense, 98 on
the ground and 44 in the air. The
defensive line was very strong
stopping in the running plays, and
putting constant pressure on the

passer. The defensive backs limit-
ed the effectiveness of Bridgewat-
er’s quarterback, when he manag-
ed to get the ball off. Carl Folcik
was named Defensive Player of
the Week, as he led the defense in
their fine showing.

For those interested in sport’s
trivia, this is the first time since
1972 that the football team has
won 3 games in one season and
the first time since Bill McHenry
took over the coaching job. It is
also the first time we have had
back-to-back wins since 1973.

Midshipmen defeat
Generals, 6-0

The upset of the year was not to
be, as the soccer Generals went
down to defeat at the hands of the
Naval Academy, 6-0, last Satur-
day. It was a close game at the
half in Annapolis, with the Mid-
dies holding a 2-0 lead. But W&L
once again fell prey to their lack
of offensive punch, being outshot
48 to five.

In addition to goalkeeper Mark
Bennett, who set two school rec-
ords in the game against division I
Navy, Coach Rolf Piranian singled
out striker Bill Stone, halfback Ed
Grandes del Mazo, and fullback
Jeff Barr for playing a strong
game. All three performers are
possible all-conference selections.
Stone continues to lead the Gen-
erals in scoring with five goals
and an assist for eleven points.
Grandes del Mazo is next with two
goals for four points.

junior from Neptune City, New
Jersey, is now W&lL’s all-time

leader in career saves. He was
credited with 28 against Navy,
giving him a total of 283 saves in
less than three full seasons. Paul
Devine had previously held the
record of 274 saves in four years.
Bennett has three games this year,
and all of next year to add to his
mark. The 28 saves is also a school
record for most saves in one
game, formerly held by Tom Mit-
chell, who made 25 saves in a 1967
game. Bennett is a sure bet to
break Mitchell’s seasonal mark of
150. With three contests remain-
ing, Bennett has 137 saves.

The Generals wrap-up their
1976 season this week. The boot-
ers play conference games at
Hampden-Sydney on Tuesday and
at Roanoke on Sunday. The final
home game of the year is Friday
at 3:00 p.m. against Virginia Tech.

The J.V. soccer Generals are
now 2-2-1 on the year after losing
to Eastern Mennonite 2-1, and de-
feating Dabney Lancaster C. C.
4-0.

And it was not until Wednesday

they embrace being carried out.
The Republicans must get used
to disagreeing with a lot of what
happens in Washington. All of us
must accustom ourselves to a
massive change. All of us are see-
ing, for the first time in our lives,
a changing of the guard in D.C.,
a new regime to control and di-
rect our nation and our lives.

I, for one, was not ready for
it, even after reading several
papers and magazines for the last

year. I think I share that unreadi-
ness with most of the students
here. Even the Democrats on
campus are not sure exactly what
will happen after the inaugura-
tion. But after the strain of an
election night that went into the
hours even accounting majors
don’t keep as a regular thing, the
wait for January 29, 1977, the last
days of Jerry Ford and maybe the
Republican party should be easy
by comparison.

E.C. quiet .. for now

By ROBERT CHIAVIELLO

In a peaceful meeting Monday
night the Executive Committee
heard subcommittee reports and
discussed holding hearings about
the Publications Board.

Dave McLean, Ring-tum Phi
business manager, reported that
the RtP is investigating the pos-
sibility of switching to offset
printing. The reasons McLean
gave were that offset is a much
easier process and that it would
give the Phi the option of print-
ing more than four pages.

The added expense would be
financed by raising the advertise-
ment rates, McLean said. It was
also reported that the RtP had
overrun its budget, specifically its
photography budget and that this
may necessitate a request for
added funds from the E.C.

Paul Larkin reported that the
Student Activities Board was
planning a pep rally for the foot-
ball team the Friday of Home-
coming and that the SAB would
pick up the cost of the rally.

Jim Underhill recommended
that the Who’s Who selection com-
mittee be restructured. He sug-
gested that some seniors be ap-
pointed to the committee. As it
stands now the committee is made
up of six juniors and six sopho-
mores. The E.C. tabled discussion
on the matter till a later date.

Walt Kelly requested that the
E.C. open hearings on the state
of the various publications here
at W&L. It was decided to hold
a special meeting at 7 p.m.
Wednesday, Nov. 17. All those
interested are encouraged to at-
tend.

nearby, and the cotton rapidly
became engulfed in flame.

Unable to extinguish the blaze
himself, Mr. Stadler was aided by
several persons close at hand who
helped to put out the fire by
rolling him on the floor, Callison
said.

Mr. Stadler was taken by the
Rescue Squad first to Stonewall
Jackson Hospital. Later he was
transfered to the Burns Center
of the University of Virginia
Medical Center, where he has
since remained. His condition is
now reported to be greatly im-
proved, and he is expected to be
released in about a week and a
half, according to Mr. Callison.

Evans liquor license considered

in the wake of a_ liquorless
senior mixer, Senior Representa-
tive Walt Kelley said he plans to
ask the Executive Committee to
recommend to Dean John that
Evans Dining Hall apply for a
liquor license.

The recommendation would
have to go through the University
Council, and eventually pass the
Board of Trustees before it could

be implemented, according to
Kelley.
Gerry Darrell, manager of

Evans Dining Hall, said he asked
about applying for a special

permit to serve mixed drinks for
the senior mixer but was told by
Whitehead that it was a Board
of Trustees matter.

Dean John said he is not sure
he would support a liquor license
and added that he was not sure
how much support there would be
for the idea.

The lack of a liquor license
came to light several weeks ago
when Evans Dining Hall was un-
able to serve liquor at a senior
mixer. Students from W&L and
surrounding women’s _ schools
came expecting mixed drinks. In-

balance, accuracy and profes-
sional competence, He prepares
almost daily critiques for The
Post’s editors, based on his own
findings and complaints from
readers. He serves as the reader's
contact with the news department

be Prof. R. H. MacDonald, head
of W&L’s department of Journ-
alism. Another panel member will
be Alf Goodykoontz, managing
editor of the Richmond Times-
Dispatch.

‘The

stead, beer and a wine cooler
were served.

The Cockpit and the dining hall
operate under separate licenses
and both are allowed to serve beer
only. Under this system people
being served beer in Evans Dining
Hall are not allowed to carry it
through the Student Union or into
the Cockpit and those buying beer
in the Cockpit are not allowed
to leave with it.

When ABC licenses for the din-
ing hall and the Cockpit were con-
sidered in 1959 by the Board of
Trustees, they found too many
problems with a liquor license,
according to Dean John.

Primary among the concerns
of the board was the problem of
carding people at an event, ac-
cording to John. The board also
thought a liquor license would be
advantageous to only 20 per cent
of the student body, he said.

A past and present concern of
the administration is the competi-
tion to local merchants W&L
would offer if they expanded to
a liquor license or an off-premises
beer license, John said. James
Whitehead, treasurer of W&L,
stressed that the school does not
intend to compete with local
merchants.

Loan committee
set up to help
broke students

New Staff

The Student Emergency Loan
Committee has been formed as a
joint committee of the Student
Control Committee and the Cold
Check Committee.

In the past the fines collected
by SCC and Cold Check were turn-
ed over to the general fund of
the Eecutive Committee. Bill
Craver, President of SCC, felt that
this money could serve a better
purpose.

The purpose of the Student
Emergency Loan Committee is to
provide loans, in the form of a
promissory, for students who are
facing substantial financial hard-
ship. The loans are made for a
maximum of 30 days and would
be interest free.

Craver said there are no specific
guidelines and the committee is
free to set up its own terms.
Craver emphasized that this com-
mittee is administered and run
solely by students.

The committee members are Ed
Callison, Freeman Jones, Mel
Wileox, and Watson Wright.
Craver said the committee got
organized last week and is now
ready to begin operation. Anyone
seeking further information on
the Student Emergency Loan Com.
mittee is advised to contact one
of the four members.

antenna atop Reid Hall now sends 19-and-a-half hours of programming
to the Lexington-Rockbridge area daily.

More than 50 students are involved in all facets of broadcasting
classical, jazz and rock music, news, public affairs and sports. A
Journalism Department faculty member, Jery! Davis, serves as WLUR's
general manager. But direct control of the staff and day-today pro
gramming decisions are always entrusted to a student station manager

This year’s student leader is John Palda, a senior psychology
major from Cleveland. Palda is perhaps best known to fans of WLUR's
late-night progressive rock show, “Third Ear.”

PHI; WLUR has always been an object of argument among students
who don't understand its role. Why don't you start by deseribing the
station's operating philosophy”

PALDA: WLUR is a community-service station, more or less run
by students, Since we are community service, we are also nonprofit
and we tend to operate as a laboratory for the Journalism Department,
But we do have spots open for other students, too

PHI: Is the goal of serving the community more important than
the idea of acting as a lab, a training ground for students’

PALDA: I think they are equally important, One thing that's come
to my attention within the last couple of weeks is that there are radio
stations at other universities that will always run essentially the same
type of programming. And here's no community service in terms of
diversity of programming

We're a lot more diverse than that. We deal as much with the
tastes of the community as with the tastes of the student body

PHI: Do you think it’s a real community service to run classics
while a station such as WVWR in Roanoke also programs an extensive
amount of classics?

PALDA: Well, yeah, | think it is, because the programming in
ltoanoke is not accessible to local residents. They can request musical
selections from us. At the same time, much of our classical program
ming is, | think, of higher quality

PHL Do students on the WLUR staff agree with you and with the
station's philosophy—or do you have dissension in that area’

PALDA: Just through being connected with the radio station for
three vears, | have been exposed to the different types of programming
and I have seen the rationale behind that programming. So, I'm no
longer bent toward a format that would be all rock or something like
that, which would be programming for a special-interest group

dissension and, luckily, it’s not anything that makes it uncomfortable
to work with the other people, I think they more or less accept our
community-service status.

They'd like to see some change toward more programming for the
student body. But, at the same time, | think they can understand that
since our license is along the lines of a community-service station,
we have to fulfill these requirements of the FCC (Federal Communica-
tions Commission).

And we still have to consider enlarging our audience
only way to do that is to atrract the community-at-large

PHI; Then, is the Lexington community audience more important
to you than the student audience?

PALDA: I'd say that both of them are equally important. The
student audience is important because there really is no other fo m
of radio entertainment in this area that would meet the tastes of the
student body

The Lexington community, at the same time, because we have such
a concentration of educated people in the area, Tm sure they're
dissatisfied with some of the cultural broadcasting that’s provided in
this area. So we have a responsibility to them, too

PHI: This term, WLUR has been experimenting with a schedi'e
which has a great number of innovations in it. For example, tie
classical’ music programming runs later in the evening, from eiy):t
to nidnight. What kind of reaction have you gotten to this?

PALDA: It seems that those who prefer classics prefer that i
in the early evening. And at the same time, those who prefer rock
seem to prefer it at night

PHI: Does this mean you might be changing back to a more trodi
tional schedule next term”

PALDA: We might be. That's something Ill have to speak to
Davis about when we talk about programming for the next semes
I think that will definitely be something we're going to look into

PHIL: This seems to indicate that listener preference plays an im
portant role in your scheduling decisions. Are program ratings impo
ant to you’ Does the value of a show to WLUR depend on how many
people listen to it?

PALDA: That's important in that it carries a lot of weight, but
it doesn’t have the final say in whether we maintain programming
of a certain type. Some of our programs undoubtedly have limited
listenership. But at the same time, we try to present a bit of variety
that’s not presented anywhere else

Programs like that serve to advertise the diversity of the radio
station. If you can't get it somewhere else, you can get it on WLUR
And 1 think, if anything, that’s one of our best advertisements, Di
versity is the name of the game at WLUR

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, November 11, 1976

Apologia

I know of just one person who liked last week's issue of
the Ring-tum Phi, and it wasn't me. Aside from that, the re-
action was universally in accord: lousy.

Naturally, I feel badly about this. God knows we try and
try to keep this thing at least readable even though it is an
incredible bitch to put out week after week. The presidential
straw poll (ambitious by RtP standards) and the real election
created a physical and emotional tension whose catharsis left
many of us drained and disoriented; attempting to piece to
gether a front page immediately before and after (during, for
some) election night s ino way to enjoy oneself or anybody
else. I've been trying unsuccessfully to relax ever since.

Then there was the communications breakdown between
the editorial and business staffs. We were gathering copy for
a regular four-page edition while they were collecting ads
in anticipation of a special six-page issue which never really
got beyond conceptual form. The real problem there, however,
lies in another area—my friends the very fine printers at the
Journalism Laboratory Press are so overwhelmed with work
that they find the very idea of putting out a six-page paper
laughable, and they're hard to argue with. A similar problem
was encountered this week.

Also: although I feel that the caliber of the copy turned
in to the Ring-tum Phi has been generally higher than in past
years, the number of regular contributors is still frustratingly
low. Negotiations are now in progress whose outcome may
allow us to print six pages at will, but we will not pursue that
course unless convinced that we will receive enough quality
material to make it worthwhile.

Anyway—we know we screwed up and we're sorry,
(Note to F.G.—Write a decent story and I'll give you a
byline and a decent headline.)

Privacy

Oft-noted but never corrected department: I walked into
the Cockpit restroom the other night only to be confronted
with the spectacle of every urinal and stall being occupied by
a group of “locals.” Now, trying not to sound like some sort
of aristocratic elitist pig: what the hell are these people doing
monopolizing our facilities? The reported incidents of theft
and vandalism are but natural symptoms and consequences
of the underlying inconsistency. Yes, many of these persons-
the vast majority of which are young—are probably economi-
cally underprivileged and socially restricted, and all the rest.
They need a place to go. Nonetheless, this University and 1ts
attendant facilities are a private institution and not a public
recreation area. Sure, I'm all for improved “town-gown” rela-
tions and the betterment of the “human condition,” but the
University’s primary responsibility is to its students.

Monday. Twelve midnight. Some
on campus are already asleep,
others are watching the Monday
Night football game, many are
studying. But on the third floor of
Reid Hall, Todd Tyson is engineer-
ing, producing, and hosting the
Monday night installment of
WLUR’s Third Ear program:

“Good evening. It’s 12 o’clock.
My name is Todd Tyson and you're
listening to Third Ear on WLUR,
Lexington.” His voice is calm,
quiet, and precise. He is totally at
ease at the microphone.

Todd is more organized than
most of the disc jockeys who do
Third Ear. He has compiled a
list of the albums that he brought
to the studio with the songs he
intends to play and has a rough
timetable as to when they will
be aired.

The program begins with cuts
from Pablo Cruise and the Elec-
tric Light Orchestra. The albums
are his own. WLUR claims to
have a large record library, but
most of the DJs say it is insuffici-
ent. “The bulk of the records are
outdated, even the recent releases
are records that never made it
and never will; just the physical
condition of most of their (the
station’s) records makes them un-
playable.” He plays a cut from
Al Stewart's latest recording, then
airs a song from one of the

studio’s Traffic albums—the qual-
ity is poor and we can hear static
on the studio’s monitors.

Todd has to keep a listing of
everything he plays in the pro-
gram log. An extensive log is not
required by the FCC, but the
station manager likes to look over
the book. The list is also helpful
for the disc jockeys when they
play five or six songs in a row.

Todd “overdubs” on a rather
sedate Jerry Garcia song, giving
the cuts he has played since the
last break and some humorous
news shorts while the music plays
in the background. The overdub-
bing gives a nice effect over the
air, very professional sounding.
It is the trademark of his shows.

True to his program plan, Todd
plays a recently released album of
a new group called Boston in its
entirety. When he swivels away
from the control panel, one of
the wheels of his chair falls off.
As he bends down to fix it his
only comment is: “all the equip-
ment in this place is in such
great shape.” Only one of the
earphones in the control room’s
headset works.

The phone rarely rings, in fact,
by 1:30, only two calls have come
in. I ask Todd if he ever wond-
ered about how small an audience
he might have. The question seems
to stump him. He hadn’t thought
about it before. “I try to have a

Uncle Vanya

By RICHARD S. WOLF

The University Theater opened
its season Monday night with a
superb rendition of Anton
Chekov’s Uncle Vanya. The play,
which could very easily have
lapsed into the mere bantering
about of melodramatic dialogue,
was held together by some fine
acting and even better direction
by Lee Kahn.

Uncle Vanya is a difficult play
to perform in that it is almost
void of a unifying plot structure.
Nothong really happens in the
play; there is no unravelling of
story, per se. Thus the portrayal
of characters is all important in
Uncle Vanya and the University
Theaters successful production is
all the more laudable because of
this.

The setting for the play is the
rural Russian estate of Alexander
Serebryakov, a retired university
professor. He and his young and
beautiful second wife have re-
cently moved here from the city.
Also in attendence at the house
are Serebryakov’s mother-in-law
from his first marriage, her son,
the professor’s daughter from his
previous marriage, a country doc-
tor and assorted Russian peasents.
The interaction and contrasting
of these various characters is the
motivation of the play. They are
all seemingly trapped in the house
together and are all bored and
unhappy for one reason oF
another.

The title character, Uncle
Vanya, is the most miserable of
all. He despises and is jealous
of his borther-inlaw, the pro-
fessor. Vanya feels that he has
wasted his life and that this is
in part the fault of the professor.
Paul Morella played Vana well,
presenting enough of the char-
acter’s pathos without being
bogged down by it.

Set in opposition to Vanya is
Dr. Astrov. He too feels that he
has wasted his life, but instead
of giving in to melancholy as
Vanya does, Astrov puts on a
cynical mask and shields himself
from human emotions. Except for
a passing passion for the profes-
sor’s wife Yelena, Astrov has no
emotional concern for the mem
bers of the household. Paul Cella
turned in the neatest bit of acting
of the evening as the disillusioned
doctor

In the extremely difficult role
of Serebryakov'’s daughter Sonia,
Betty Kahn offered an excellent
portrayal. Sonia, like Vanya, is
wasting away on the estate. Her
love for Dr. Astrov is one-sided
and she can find not satisfaction
in her life. At times she is miser
able like Vanya, but she also
has the strength to endure her
troubles and carry on with life
Mrs. Kahn dominated the last two

acts of the play with her per-
formance.

Other kudos must go out to
Al Gordon and Pree Ray for their
marvelous character roles as the
professor and his mother-in-law.
In fact the only weak spot in the
whole cast was Kim Bailey’s por-
trayal of the professor's wife.
Much more could have been done
with this role had her acting not
been as stiff as her hairdo.

The production of Uncle Vanya
is the premiere play for the Old
Boiler Room Theatre in the base-
ment of the Old Main Street build-
ing. Renovation of the room has
been going on for some time now
and the result is a unique little
theatre for experimental drama
at W&L. The play was presented
in the surround; the audience sat
on swivel chairs in the middle,
and the action took place all
around them. It one dosn’t mind
knocking knees occasionally it is
an interesting concept. It par-
ticularly lent itself to Uncle
Vanya because the encircling
action gave the audience a much
closer view of the actors, and
this was important because of the
intimacy and subtlety of the play.

The set, and lighting, designed
by Sam Steves as a Senior design
thesis, worked very well in the
Old Boiler Room. The set pro-
vided for some interesting block-
ing and the lighting was con-
trolled enough to enhance the
closeness of the action.

If one can find one major com-
plaint about the production, it
must be that the theatre allows
for so few seats. It is a pity that
more people did not have the op-
portunity to see Uncle Vanya.

balanced program—something for
everyone—but, if nobody’s listen-
ing, at least I like what I’m
playing.” My inquires are inter-
rupted by a comparative deluge
of phone calls. One is a request.
Another is from a VMI keydet
who called to give his sanction
of the Boston album. My timing
must have been bad.

Two of the five calls Todd has
received tonight were requests
for the Flesh Pile Blues Band, so
he has to dig up the station’s
tape of the group. His album show
is drawing to a close, another
record is on the second turntable
ready to go after he finishes his
announcements. While the Allman
Brothers perform on the air, Todd
tries to ready the tape machine
with the Flesh Pile Blues Band,
but during the Grateful Dead he
decides that they are not worth
the trouble. Whoever made the
request will just have to be dis-
appointed tonight.

“It’s one fifty-nine, my name is
Todd, and I'll be with you here
tonight until two-thirty. Its an
abominable twenty-two degrees
outside now...”

Twenty minutes after he had
put the tape back on its shelf,
Todd feels confident that he has
discovered the problem with the
tape player. The former W&L stu-
dents now turned musicians who

comprise the Flesh Pile Blues
Band finally go over the air at
2:17. The first request had been
eight minutes into the show. But
the callers probably didn’t mind
the wait; they were the band
members themselves, partying the
night away somewhere in town.

During a cut from Genesis—one
of the station’s albums, complete
with static and scratches—Todd
starts closing up the station: turn-
ing out the lights, taking the final
transmitter reading, making sure
dors are locked. He uses the over-
dub technique again in his sign-
off. Tis timing is exact and he ends
his commentary just as the song
ends. The cartidge of the station’s
sign-off is inserted in the tape
machine and blares out over the
air, the loud assertive voice of
the announcer is a shock after
two and a half hours of Todd’s
quiet delivery: “WLUR, Lexing-
ton, ninty-one and a half on your
FM dial, concludes another broad-
cast day...”

As we leave the studio and walk
down the corridor, I can hear the
Associated Press wire machines
typing out the latest news in the
dark, empty newsrooms and my
thoughts cannot help but turn to
the guys who will be going into
that room in three and a half
hours preparing to do the morn-
ing show. Maybe someone will
write a story on them, someday.

Dear Mr. Lutz:

As President of the Washington
and Lee University Alumni As-
sociation, I was pleased to read
your recent editorial, which sub-
stantially quoted the talk given
by Sandy Stradtman to this year’s
Freshman Class as a means of
introducing it to our honor sys-
tem. I can assure you that no
tradition is more cherished by our
alumni than the honor system, nor
is any aspect of student life more
likely to stir alumni interest than
problems involving the honor sys-
tem. I have felt in recent years
that too much attention has been
given to matters relating to en-
forcement of the system and too
little attention to the system it-
self as a way of life. Sandy Stradt-
man’s talk convinces me that the
emphasis is now returning to the
honor system as a way of life and
I congratulate him and the entire
student body.

Sincerely yours,

Having just read the article on
the students nominated for Who’s

Colleges, let me just say that

those names represent the great-
est collection of mediocrity |!
have ever seen. There is only one
student in the entire group who
actually deserves to be included in
Who's Who. (John X. Miller, in
case you're interested.)

The sole prerequisite for in
clusion is apparently the number
of activities the student partici-
pated in. Scholastic ability seems
not to have been considered at all.
It might be interesting to examine
the grade-point-average of some
of these people.

Washington and Lee is a great
university, but you’d never know
it from looking at the list of
W&L students in Who's Who.
W&L should do its part to insure
a student is nominated for that
honor mainly on the basis of
scholastic ability and not because
he is student body president.

IM championship playoffs
won by PiKA, newcomers

The intramural football and
golf seasons have been completed,
and tennis playoffs are to be
wrapped up this week. This year’s
football.champions are the Grand-
standers, and the golf champion
is PiKA. Bouth teams fought their
way successful through regular
seasons and eightteam playoff
formats to become champions of
their respective sports.

PiKa beat the Phi Delts in the
playoff finals to become this year’s
IM golf champions. PiKA was
seeded number one in the playoffs
while Phi Delt was seeded number
two. As expected they met in the
finals. PiKa’s team this year was
made up of Charlie Sipple, Jim
Fisher, and last week’s player of
the week Frank Ellerke. In the
championship match they shot
nine hole scores of 38, 37, and 36
respectively for a combined team
score of 111, handily beating the
Phi Delts’ 121. The other teams
to make the championship play-
offs this year were Sigma Chi,
Delta Tau, SAE, Phi Kappa Psi,
Law, and Lambda Chi. The golf
program was conducted by Head
Official Jim Berlin.

This year’s IM football champ-
ionship was won by a true cind-
erella team. Throughout the regu-
lar season, and the playoffs, the
Grandstanders were barely able to
field enough players to keep from
forfeiting. In the playoffs they

Soccer Generals end
season with victory
over Roanoke College

The soccer Generals put it all
together in the season’s final
game, a 1-0 win over conference
rival Roanoke College. The team
finished the 1976 season with a
3-10 mark, the same as in 1975,
and finished with a 1-3 mark in
conference play. Earlier in the
week, the Generals lost a hard
fought battle to Virginia Tech 1-0,
and were defeated at Hampden-
Sydney 3-1.

Goalkeeper Mark Bennett cap-
ped a brilliant season with the
team’s first shutout. Bennett came
up with 18 saves against Roanoke,
giving him a total of 192 for
the season, a school record. Only
a junior, he is also the school
record holder for most saves in
a career, 238, and most saves in
one game, 28, set against Navy
earlier this season. Bennett will
be the nucleus of next year’s
team.

Sophomore Bill Stone, the Gen-
erals’ most consistent forward all
season, scored the lone goal in
the Roanoke win, with an assist
fom Jamie Veghte. Both Stone
and Bennett have credentials for
all-confernece recognition. Stone
finished the season as the teams’
leading scorer with six goals and
one assist for 13 points. Seniors
captains Jeff Barr and Mike Mona-
han, as well as Doug Hunter play-
ed their final game for in the
Roanoke game, and they went out
in style.

Records for the 1976 season:
Goals for 15; goals against 37:
total shots 262; shots per game
average 20.2.

Individual Scoring records are:
(goals, assists, total) B. Stone 6-1-
13: E. Grandes del Mazo 2-1-5; T.
Tyson 2-1-5; J. Veghte 1-2-4; J.
Page 1-1-3; H. Collier 1-1-3; M.
Manahan 1-0-2.

had to beat the numbers one, two,
and three teams of last season in
order to take the title. They did
ust that, in this, their first year
together. In the finals they beat
a very tough PiKA team.

The championship game was
played in truly adverse conditions.
Monday was cold and windy. The
temperature was in the 30’s and
the wind chill factor was much
lower. Four officials: Bill Flesher,
Jeff Slatcoff, Sal Abruzzese and
Rocky Joyner, worked the game,
and it was tough, clean, and well-
played. The final score, 8-7.

The Grandstanders scored on
their first possession of the game.
Quarterback Bruce Howard con-
nected with wide receiver Chris
Kearney on an eight-yard TD pass
in the corner of the end zone.
The extra point was broken up,
leaving the score 6-0. The two
teams traded first quarter turn-
overs before PiKA statred its own
touchdown drive. Following an

interception by Tad Leithead,
PiKA marched to the six yard
line. Faking a sweep, quarterback
Jim Fisher rolled to his right
and passed across the width of
the field to Cliff Sondack in the
opposite corner of the end zone.
Tom Ezzel left the score at 7-6
Fishers extra point completion to

at the end of the first quarter.

The rest of the first half was
scoreless with the exception of
a drastic safety scored against
PiKA. With ten seconds left in
the half PiKA was froced to punt
on fourth down. The snap flew
over the punter’s head and out
of the back of the end zone. A
safety was called putting the score
at 8-7 in favor of the Grand-
standers.

Neither team scored in the
second half. Both teams played
solid defense, and the gusting
winds made it very difficult to
throw accurately. The Grand-
standers’ defensive front line of
Paul Larkin, Phil Dunlay, and Ed
Rogers constantly presured the
quarterback and were able to
control PiKA’s usually devastat-
ing sweep. Defensive back Maz
Rutland and Chuck Tredgold
bottled up PiKA’s top receiver
Sam Wilburn. The final score was
the same as it had been at half-
time, Grandstanders 8, PiKA 7.

The game’s standout player had
to be Chris earney. Offensively he
caught several passes, including
one for the Grandstanders’ only
touchdown. Defensively he made
three interceptions. All day long
he seemed to be always in the
right place at the right time.

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

 

Generals fall to Millersville

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball Generals will entertain Get-
tysburg College of Pennsylvania
this Saturday at 1:30 p.m. on Wil-
son Field. The game is the teams’
final home contest of the 1976
season.

Gettysburg has a record of
three wins and six defeats on the
season, and will be playing their
final game. The Generals, after a
34-12 defeat to Millersville State
last Saturday, are now 3-5, and
need victories in their final two
games to hit the .500 mark for
the year.

Millersville State proved too
powerful last weekend, as the
Marauders rolled up 31 points
and 306 yards in total offense in

Cross-country team

finish fourth in ODAC

W&L finished in fourth place
in the First Annual Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Cross Coun-
try Championships held in Lex-
ington last Saturday. Eastern Men-
nonite took top honors with 27
points, followed by Bridgewater
with 50, Lynchburg with 52, W&L
with 103, and Hampden-Sydney
with 148. Roanoke College also
competed but with only two run-
ners.

Allen Weeks was the top W&L
runner, finishing in 15th place
mile course. EMC’s Ken Layman
with a time of 27:48 for the five
was the top individual runner
and named conference Runner of
the Year with a first place time
of 25:20.9. That time broke the
course record set in 1969 by
Howell Michael of William and
Mary by 42 seconds.

None of the W&L runners fin-
ished in the top seven, which
would have given them all con-
ference recognition. Mike Burns
came in 18th, Jim Frantz 19th.
Richard Bird 23rd, and Ned Me-
Donald 28th. Coach Roland Landes
of EMC was named the conference
Coach of the Year.

The Generals completed their
dual meet season last weekend
with a record of 9-5.

the first half. W&L fought back
and outscored Millersville in the
second half, but it was a case of
too little too late. The statistics
tell the story in this game, the
Marauders finishing with 443 yds.
in total offense to W&L’s 221.
They also had 249 yds. on the
ground to the Generals’ 71, and
19 yards in the air to W&L’s 150.
Millersville turned the bal lover
six times on four fumbles and two
interceptions, but W&L was only
able to hit paydirt on two occas-
ions.

Junior halfback Raynard Scott,
who played well all afternoon,
scored on a one yard plunge with
1:28 remaining in the first quarter
after W&L had recovered a Mill-
ersville fumble at the Marauder
13. An interference penalty
against Millersville on a pass in-
tended for Scott set up the touch-
down.

W&L’s other tally came on a
pretty pass play from QB Ted
Hissey to flanker Richard Wiles
covering 52 yards. The touchdown

They said they would, but they
didn't.

Citing the death of a relative as
cause, the Marvelettes cancelled
their scheduled apeparance at
W&L’s Homecoming bash last Fri-
day night.

Mike Armstrong, co-chairman of
the Student Activities Board, said
David Zaan, agent for the Mar-
velettes, called Thursday after-
non to ask if the engagement was
a concert or a dance. Zaan said
the Marvelettes didn’t want to do
a dance because they had a spec-
ial show.

“That was fine with us,” said
Armstrong, becauseth eir show
is a dance kind of thing.’

Zaan said they really didn’t

want to do the show but would

Armstrong, because their show
p.m. Thursday, Zaan called back
to explain the group was experi-
encing “internal problems” and
would be unable to perform Fri-
day.

“They gave us the excuse that
one of them had a father or
grandfather die and she was very
upset,” Armstrong said.

Mike Capetto, faculty adviser
of the SAB, said the contract had
certain clauses which would allow
one party to cancel the contract.
Mutual agreement, tornado, hur-
ricane, acts of war and other acts

Construction
almost on time

By LEE HOWARD
Adverse October weather and
blasting difficulties have caused
construction on the new library
to fall two weeks behind schedule
after only four months of work.
According to Construction
Supervisor Pat Brady, the major
cause of the delay was a cold, wet
October. Eight days were set
aside as rain days but were ap-
parently not enough. The cold
weather made it unfeasible to
pour cement, Brady said.
Suprisingly obdurate rock has
also been a significant cause of
the delay, making blasting less
effective, Brady said. Compound-
ing this problem has been the
necessity of using smaller charges
because of the damage done by
a large dynamite shot a few
weeks ago. his has meant that
more charges have to bet set and
this takes more time he said.
Brady said he sees no reason
why, weather permitting, the
(hirty-month job could not be
completed on time. He said there
is no problem acquiring building
materials as there was during
construction of the new law
school. He added that there should
be no delays of the magnitude of
either the law school or the
Woods Creek apartments.

of God were excuses for backing
out. “It’s the act of God clause
that they will contest’ Capetto
said.

“We didn’t think the Mar-
velettes were the kind of act
that would cancel out or try to
pull any shenanigans,” he said. “I
don’t really think this will end up
in court. We'll just say ‘Listen,
we lost a thousand bucks. What
are you going to do about it?’
And hopefully, we can agree on
some out-of-court settlement.”

Armstrong feels that the Mar-
veiettes do not have solid grounds
for breaking the contract. He
said “We are having a lawyer
look over the contract and we are
asking the Marvelettes for a letter
of explanation. “If it doesn’t suit
our purposes,” Armstrong § said,
‘we could possibly proceed into
litigation. But right now, it is
up in the air. We’re going to see
if they were working somewhere
else.”

John Berley, the other co-chair-
man of the SAB, said the school
may lose about $100. He said the
SAB originally planned to charge
one dollar admission for the
dance, but when the Marvelettes
cancelled, the SAB decided not
to charge admission. Berley said

Republicans

By JIM PARKER

An internal rift over whether
to continue membership in the
College Republican Federation of
Virginia has been settled by
W&L’s CR club, and the decision
is to remain within the federation.

Club officials maintain that the
rift no longer exists and that
the split among members has been
healed.

Some members wanted to pull
out of the federation because of
the dominant role of the Uni-
versity of Virginia College Re-
publican Club, according to W&L
Republican Club President Chuck
Rogers. That split has been mend-
ed now, he said.

Bill Kerr, one of the supporters
of pulling out of the federation,
said that the CRs will vote in
favor of remaining in the organi-
ation and the club members will
support the decision “200 per
cent.”

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, NOVEMBER 18, 1976

SAB investigate back out

he expected 1000 persons to at-
tend.

Capetto feels the SAB has three
alternatives. Their first is to file
a complaint with the National
Entertainment Conference in
Columbia, 8.C. That organization,
composed of nearly all colleges
and booking firms in the nation,
would investigate and try to solve
the matter.

Their second alternative is to
drop the question entirely, “If
the SAB thinks the replacement
band was good and that every-
body had a good time, they could
just forget the whole thing” said
Capetto. “The court fees and
lawyer expenses could nearly use
up a $1009 settlement.”

The SAB’s final alternative
would be to sue the Marvelettes.
Capetto said, “The courts are way
down on the bottom of the list.
There are a whole lot of other
things we can do first. All we
would like to do is to resolve the
issue. They may have a very
logical excuse for not showing up
that we don’t know about. Maybe
the Marvelette had swine flu, I
don’t know. If they had a good
substantiated reason for not at-
tending the dance Friday night,
we'll drop the matter,” he said.

heal rift

A major reason for staying in
the federation is to give the
freshmen members a chance to
work for the organization, accord-
ing to W. J. Lorentz de Haas.
Among the group in favor of
staying in the federation were Ben
Lowe, Lorentz de Haas, who is
running for a spot on the federa-
tion board, and freshman E.C.
Representative Jacob Jones.
Among the opposition were Bill
Kerr and Mike Adams.

The W&L organization has
been named the best college
Republican club in the nation four
of the five times it has been
awarded. The newsletter put out
by the club has been named num-
ber one in the country in 1971
and 1975. The club has also helped
start Republican organizations at
most of the area girls’ schools,
including Sweet Briar, Randolph-
Macon and Southern Seminary.

demanded the impeachment of President Richard Nixon.

The University Democrats

already very popular on most campuses

picked up dovens of new members. Students reasoned, What better
way to protest the corrupt Republican Administration?”

One of the multitude of impeachment petitions came from the
Washington and Lee University Democrats. Like their brothers and
sisters acress the United States, the W&L Democrats were opinionated

and committed to their cause.

Little discussion had been needed before the vote on their im-
peachment resolution, And the result was a foregone conclusion,

It was unanimous.

in that peak year of antiGOP sentiment, the W&L

Miss Elizabeth Taylor

Number 9

 

Warner & Taylor
speak at W@L

On the morning of November
11, a press conference was held by
former Secretary of the Navy
John Warner and his fiance Eliza-
beth Taylor.

Q: Mr. Warner, since Senator
Scott has just announced that he
is not going to run for a Senate
seat again in 1978, are you pre-
pared to announce that you might
run for that seat?

Warner: I am not a candidate
for public oflice. | have a very
strong feeling for Washington and
Lee, and VMI, and I think it
would be wrong for any individual
to accept an invitation from either
institution and then use that in-
vitation and the presence on these
really hallowed, venerable
grounds to foster any political in-
terests the individual might have.

Q: Mr. Warner, you're out of
a job now, so what will you be
doing?

Warner: This is really the first
period of time when I've been
unemployed, I just hope I can
support you (to Miss Taylor); if
I can't, will you support me?

I think the people who worked in the Carter campaign are still
interested in doing other political activities the rest of the year. That

wasn't their sole interest.

RtP: Well, for a lot of people—that was their sole interest, How
do you get them to stick with the club?

WINN: We plan to try to keep their interest up. We have several
projects planned. We're going to have a joint party with the Randolph

Macon Woman's College YDs

And then we have something in the

works that I can’t tell you about at this moment.
We plan to participate in the state convention at the end of the
year. And in the statewide Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner, too, That's

for all state Democrats
RiP

young and old.
Still, interest among some members could wane, as it did

in 1974. Do you think you could be entering a critical phase in the

club's development now’

WINN: Yes, I think this is a transition period right now. But with
the projects we have planned, we still should be able to reach the
people who have other interests besides the presidential election

RiP: Money was always a problem for the old W&L Young Demo
crats. How about with the new ones”

WINN

I really don't know if | should say exactly how much we

to keep the Young Democrats alive

But this year, there has been an attempted resurrection. Sopho
more Benn Winn, a politics major from Martinsville, Va., is the presi
dent of the brandnew W&L Young Democrats. And somehow, his
group has managed to find 33 campus Democrats willing to pay dues

Some observers even say that the club might have a bright future

utr: Democrats are definitely in the minority at W&L. Do you
have any idea how many there are in the student body?

WINN: I really couldn't say. Students can call themselves Demo
erats, but there’s a difference between activists and people who just
say. “I'm a Democrat.” We think we've reached most of the activists
here are a few we're still after

hiP: De vou think the widespread interest in the presidential
election could be the reason for your surprising success in getting
members?

WINN: Our large turnout could be attributed to that. But I think
we've managed to keep the interest high enough that it'll carry on
Our activists are interested in all polilical campaigns and all political

functions

have. But we did pick up some money the other club left. So we're
sitting fairly well right now. | ean say we do have enough money to
carry on our minor projects

RiP: An earlier Ringtum Phi story said your membership comes
mostly from the underclassmen. Is that still true?

WINN: No, we have several seniors. It's pretty well evenly dis
tributed, | would say. The article you printed earlier said we had only
one senior, At the time, we did. But we have several seniors now

RtP: You sound optimistic about the elub’s future. What's the
difference between you and the previous unsuccessful attempts’

WINN: Well, I don't know that much about the previous attempts
But I think it may have been a failing of the other clubs that they
didn’t try to do anything. But we have our projects—and there's a
gubernatorial election coming up next year that should be of interest
to everyone

We're definitely not here just to counteract the Republicans on
campus. This is to give people who consider themselves Democrats
something to identify with. We're a close-knit group.

i think we're going to be a growing club

Ilowever, I have a marvelous
farm, which is the joy of my
life, on which I've been living now
for eight years in northern Vir-
ginia. It is a big operating catile
farm, and Miss Taylor and | are
going to live there, it’s our resi-
dence.

You might be interested to
know that this summer, once Miss
Taylor consented to marry me,
she went out and branded her
first calf one morning at 6:30. So,
we're going to take a consider-
able interest in our farm for the
forseeable future.

Q: Do you think you'll be able
to support Miss Taylor on a farm
in the style with which she is
accustomed?

Warner: Surely: from out of
nowhere, several things keep pil-
ing up, so I think for the im-
mediate future we'll have suflici-
ent funds. I would like to say that
we re going to cure our own hams
for Thanksgiving and Christmas—

Taylor: I prefer a turkey.

Warner: | think one other thing
is of interest. I gave. with the
greatest of joy, an engagement
ring which I designed myself, and
she gave me in return, two dairy
cows and a bull. So, we're off
to a good start.

Q: Has a wedding date been
set, Mr. Warner.

Warner: We decided that the
best way to arrange the wedding
was to give our mothers, both in
their 80's, full discretion and con-
trol, At this moment, they are
trying to gather up a handful! of
children. some of whom are
scattered abroad, and mine here
in school. As soon as we <an
get the children together, and the
two 80-year-old mothers select the
date, we'll have it.

Q: Miss Taylor, what attracted
you to Mr. Warner?

Taylor: His integrity. and honor:
I like everything about him

Q: What are your impressions
of Lexington’

Taylor: Well, to give a cor vet
impression, I would have
here longer. My immediate in
pression is one of such unity;
everybody works together. It is
a beautiful place. I wish 1 could
stay here longer

Later that afternoon Mr

the hell they're talking about might be too subtle for the
boneheads to comprehend, And I'm not talking just about
the E.C., whom I take to be at least well-intentioned, To those
of you who are the very sources and causes of my anger and
look out.

Last night at 7 o'clock the E.C, was scheduled to begin a
long-awaited investigation into the workings of the Publica-
tions Board with the intention, according to George Griffin,
junior representative, of doing “whatever we have to do to
make the constitutions coincide.”

He was referring to the student body constitution, which
the E.C. swears to uphold, and the Publications Board consti-
tution, which is none of the E.C.’s dman business.

The investigation is the latest addition to the E.C.’s long
and reckless record of unnecessary intrusion into the function-
ing of the various campus media, ~

The interference began last year when the 75-76 E.C.
told the staff of the ill-fated W&L Thymes what they could
print if they wanted any more student body funds for their
publication.

Later in the year the E.C. agreed to give WLUR enough
cash to supplement their sports budget and allow the radio
station to broadcast away lacrosse games, The allocation
came along with a strong recommendation that the station
use the sporteaster the E.C. wanted,

The present controversy began when the I.C. carried on
a two-week debate last Spring on whether or not to pay salaries
to the editors and business managers of the RtP and Calyx.

The hassle continued when someone on the E.C. men-
tioned earlier this year that the investigation would also deal
with the quality of the publications and the way the editors
are chosen,

The E.C.’s job is to allocate funds to the publications at
the beginning of each year. as required by the student body
constitution,

They should take the business managers at their word when
they present their hbudgets—we do have an honor system
here that allows us to trust one another, right?

If the publications run into a deficit, the Publications Board
has its own reserve fund—made up of publications profits,
not student body funds—to take up the slack. 4

The Publications Board also has the responsibility to
monitor the quality of the RtP and Calyx and to pick the
editors. If the F.C. thinks it can do a better job, they have
appeal power over all Publications Board decisions.

| would make the same suggestion to them that I would
make to everyone who complains about the quality of the
RtP, to everyone who has never spent 1-5 hours a day, four

days a week, thirty weeks a year putting out a regular
publication.
The suggestion is, take the damn job, Eliminate the

salaries and appoint your own editors, if you ean find them.
Put out a better paper, if you can get one of us to teach you
how. Stick your noses into an area you know little about,
if you can get used to the idea of putting in more extra-
curricular hours than most of you have ever dreamed of.

And do all this with no renumeration whatsoever,

If the idea seems a little radical and the E.C, is not ready
to take the job, to turn an independent newspaper into a house
organ, then why the investigation?

Possibly because except in the areas of public honor trials
and campus publications the E.C, has absolute power. Maybe
they want to find out what they will be getting into if they
decide to consolidate the power somew hat.

If they are not planning a takeover, which is probably

An afternoon

with Elizabeth

The following article by En-
tertainment Editor Gray Cole-
man is a compilation of com-
ments made at a seminar held
at the Trobadour Theatre, The
questions, and Miss Taylor’s
answers, should be interpreted
as paraphrases and not as direct
quotes.

Co He Bs

Last Thursday — November 11,
1976 — must go down in W&L
history as the day the movie-buffs’
prayers were answered. Elizabeth
Taylor, perhaps the last great
superstar produced by the Holly-
wood movie moguls in their gravy
days, appeared on the horizon.
In a seminar at the Troubadour
Theatre, she met the sons of the
Colonnade head-on. She came,
saw, and, by the end of the after-
noon, conquered all with her
humor and candor. Unversed as I
am in shorthand, this article in-
cludes but some of the subjects
considered in the informal ques-
tion-and-answer period.

Q: How is your acting approach
different on stage, as opposed to
sereen?

A: Well, actually, I have only
done one stage performance —
dramatic readings from Dr.
Faustus, where I primarily walked
around in a cloud of smoke. ...I
would like to do some more stage
material; perhaps I’m a bit too
lazy. But the continuity of re-
peated performances would be
fascinating.

Q: When you do the film ver-
sion of a play, how close are you
to the playwright?

A: In the case of Cat on a Hot
Tin Roof or Who's Afraid of Vir-
ginia Woolf, I didn’t meet Albee
or Williams until after the film’s
release. And, then, I was naturally
nervous. One always hopes for
approval from one’s mentors. But
in my new movie, A Little Night
Music, the writer was on the set
every day. Hugh Wheeler was de-
termined to make the rhetoric
perfect in every way, and this
often unnerved me. He disliked
every small mistake.

Q. You seem to avoid the “‘act-
ing rut” that other actresses en-
counter. Is this intentional, your
constant variety of characters?

A: I've never been in a rut...
(with a glance at her finance W&L
Trustee John Warner). After all,
variety is the spice... Next?

Q: What was your most chal-
lenging role and why?

A: Martha in Virginia Woolf, |
was in my early 30’s and had to
play a woman around 50. The chal
lenge came because of this dif-
ference in age, along with voice,
accent, walk, stance, etc. Makeup
just couldn't do it all. I was sv
afraid I'd be hung up in techni-
calities. For example, they wanted

me to take voice lessons to lower
the voice level. I didn’t want to
do this — I got 3 weeks to think
my voice down. They thought I
was crazy, but it worked.

Virginia Woolf is one of the
most fascinating plays of the past
20 years. You know, there have
even been rumors that Albee saw
his two lead characters as homo-
sexuals! This is so untrue, If a
forthright man such as Albee
meant to write about homosex-
ulas, he would never have used
a tricky device or disguise.

George and Martha are two
desperate lonely people who in-
vented a child and turn it into
the ultimate weapon. Theirs is
a love-hate relationship, deeply
touching and funny in several
parts, yet unbearably vicious, too.
The show was marvelous for me.
it was like diving into completely
different swimming pool.

Q: Where did he get those
characters?

A: I guess he must have met
hundreds of miserable people — |
haven’t you?

Comment by Al Gordon: There’s:
a famous rumor on this campus
that the male characters were
based on men he met at W&L |
during his stay here.

A: He didn’t mention it to me.

Q: Would you comment on the |
fairness of the Academy Award
system?

A: I'm all for them... I’ve got
two! If. you don’t have one, I
suppose, you tend to say it’s just
sentiment, or the other person
got it because they’re getting old,
or because the other movie made
more money. There are literally
hundreds of excuses used. All I
know is that I was pleased when
I won, and disappointed when I
lost. After all, it is the highest
accolade we can offer our peers.
And it is nice to receive.

Q: In your work, who did you
find the easiest to communicate
with?

A: Just one person? I couldn’t
say. There are too many people.
league and friend. But he was di-
Spencer Tracy was a great col-
abolical as well. On my close-ups,
he’d cross his eyes and smile!

Q: Are there any potential parts
you'd like to do?

A: I really don’t know. There's
no really burning ambition. But
if something were offered tomor-
row that was good and sparked
my interest, I'd certainly not say
no.

Q: What were your childhood
days like at MGM?

A: | loved it — total fantasy-
world, My first starving role was
with a horse, and | loved horses.
It was just being myself. In addi-
tion, my parents insisted that my

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

 

An afternoon continued Generals’ surprise: Homecoming victory

(Continued from Page 2)
friends come from outside the
studio community, to keep me
from being too insulated.

But scripts and homework made
it like no childhood at all...a
long, hard day and night’s work.
And it was six days a week, then!
I did have one hour of fantasy
a day, though, and that was lunch
at the MGM commissary. You
never knew whether you'd be
sitting with Marjorie Main or
Clark Gable! The rest was hard
work, but we all did it, because
that is what we were being paid
for, as professionals.

Q: You have often expressed
your disappointment with Butter-
field 8, yet you won the Oscar for
it in 1960. Why?

A: Mike Todd, my late husband,
had made a “gentleman’s agree-
ment” with MGM that I could
stop acting after Cat on a Hot
Tin Roof. This supposedly ended
my contract there. Around a year
later, though, I accepted Cleo-
patra at another studio. MGM
promptly called, and threatened
to stop my career entirely if I
didn’t do this new script, Butter-
field 8. By this time, MGM was
really “morally corrupt.” So I had
to wait to do Cleopatra. I guess
this is why I resented that movie
so much.

Q: Do you fight often with the
movie establishment?

A: Not any more, since the
independents like Paul Newman
and myself have taken over. The
big studios don’t have the threat-
ening power they once did. But,
twenty years ago, I remember a
good case in point. It was Louis
B. Mayer’s birthday, and we were
all supposed to stand around the
table and sing “Happy Birthday”
to that horrid old man. Perry
Como said something other than
“Happy Birthday, though. He
was black-balled from the in-
dustry for 8 years...it’s good
that this can no longer happen.

vision?

A: It’s not like the old ones...
This movie has a message, though
like the others, it’s beautiful to
look at and the music is wonder-
ful. A Little Night Music is a play
with music, not a musical, and
it was brought to the screen with
that thought in mind.

Q: How did you, as a child
actor, manage to bridge the gap
to older roles?

A: I don’t know. Just lucky, |
guess. I moved to adult parts
quickly because I matured quick-
ly. I had no extended transitional
period.

Q: How seriously do actors and
actresses take critics?

A: I don’t read critics. I used
to, but it is so demoralizing. Some-
times, I don’t even go to see one
of my films, because somewhere
along the line, while shooting, I
realized there would be problems.

Q: Would you care to speak
about The Blue Birds?

A: I'd rather not. This Soviet-
American effort was to take a few
weeks on my part. It took seven
months.

Q: Do you often go to the
theatre or movies?

A: Unfortunately, I don’t have
the time. I would like to go to
them, because I do love drama
and motion pictures. But not these
“trend films” of today! Will Ajir-
port 60 be next? It has to end —
1 even think doing King Kong
twice is awful, because it was so
good the first time! Not to men-
tion Gone With the Wind! It’s all

Jaws, airports, godfathers, god-
mothers!
Q: Do you approach Shake-

spearian roles in a different way
from others?

A: I’ve only done one Shake-
spearian film — The Taming of
the Shrew. And I was terrified.
I was surrounded by a group of
marvelous Old Vie actors who
had been doing Shakespeare for
years. While I was the only
American, the only film “star,”
and I had the lead role! I simply
stuck to this theory — don't allow
yourself to be overawed by Shake-
speare and don’t lose your bold-
ness in attacking the character.

Q: One final question. Do you
like to jump into a new film im-
mediately after completing the
previous role?

A: No... I'd much rather jump
into a nice, hot swimming pool...

~The University Supply

By NED McDONNELL

NO ONE really knows what
caused it. Some football experts
have theorized that the Homecom-
ing crowd of five thousand scream-
ing fans combined with the fif-
teen beautiful ‘Queen’ contest-
ants at halftime may have been
the reason. But whatever the
truth may be, the Generals un-
doubtedly played three brilliant
quarters of football last Satur-
day. The team, however, did let
up a bit in the final quarter to
add an element of suspense to
the whole affair.

Seeminly unaffected by a norm-
ally demoralizing loss suffered
the previous week, Coach Me-
Henry’s boys entered the game in
top form to give Gettysburg Col-
lege a rude welcome on its first
visit to the South in thirty-seven
years by downing the yankee grid-
iron team, 28-20.

The contest opened with a
scoreless first quarter marked by
tough defensive play on the part
of the Generals. Although W&L
quarterback Ted Hissey only
handled the football for six
minutes in the second quarter,
he still managed to engineer a
devastating twenty-one-point
aerial barrage in collaboration
with Richard Wiles and Tony
Perry. Five and a half minutes
into the second quarter, after
Hissey had connected with Wiles
for a thirty-yard gain, running
back Raynard Scott plunged over
the center of the Gettysburg de-
fensive line for a one-yard touch-
down run. Two and a half minutes
later, after an exchange of
fumbles, Ted Hissey heaved a
fifty-five yard picture perfect
touchdown bomb to Richard Wiles
to open W&L’s lead to 14-0. With
just under three minutes remain-
ing in the first half Scott again
plunged one yard into the end
zone, capping a drive where His-
sey and the acrobatic wide-re-
ceiver, Tony Perry, teamed up
(with the aid of a defensice inter-
ference penalty levied against
Gettysburg) to pick apart the visit-
ing defense. Down 21-0, Gettys-
burg’s quarterback Robert Le-
Comte put together a last minute
touchdown drive. But G-burg
kicker David Stein failed to con-
vert the touchdown typifying the
agonizing frustration that Gettys-
burg faced in the first half.

W&L drew blood five minutes
into the third quarter when run-

ning back Greg Cash almost single-
handedly ran through Gettys-
burg’s defensive unit (Cash scored
on a five-yard run). The third
quarter closed with W&L ahead
28-6.

But, like Jimmy Carter, the
Generals nearly blew a big lead
in the home stretch. First of all,
with nine and a half minutes left
in the contest, G-burg halfback
Kirby Seott raced forty-one yards
to a touchdown. The two-point con-
version attempt failed so W&L
still had a commanding 28-12 lead.
That commanding lead became
more and more tenuous as the
seconds ticked away. At one point,
Gettysburg had a first and goal
situation on the Generals’ four
yard line. But the tenacious de-

fenive squad stifled the visitors’
offensive attack and held the on-
slaught at the one yard line. But
the yankee team would not give
as QB Robert LeComte chucked a

five yard TD pass to Jay Howell ©

with Kirby Scott running the two
point conversion to close the gap
to 28-20 with twenty-four seconds
left in the game. The Generals fell
on the onside kick and did a fine
job of running out the last six-
teen seconds.

Quarterback Ted Hissey led the
offense for W&L by completing
fifteen of twenty-seven passes for
two hundred seventy-three yards.
Receivers Richard Wiles and Tony
Perry gained one hundred fifty-
nine and seventy-four yards re-
spectively through the air. The

Water polo a success

By ROBERT LYFORD

Imagine a Washington and Lee
fall sports team finishing second
in the state, and you'll probably
be accused of having one too
many glasses of grain, at least
if you express your fantasy. But
the W&L Water Polo team did
just that (no, they didn’t fanta-
size, finishing second in the state
behind the University of Rich-
mond. And water polo isn’t even
a varsity sport here yet?

Under the helm of Coach
Stearns, athletes have been re
cruited from P.E. classes, as well
as from our fine Swim Team. In
lacking varsity status, however,
W&L water polo players are not
only deprived of recognition but
presently do not receive gym
eredit for their efforts. Further-
more, non-varsity status restricts
their schedule and discourages
potential participants.

Nevertheless, Coach Stearns
has generated incredible enthusi-
asm in this fast action, finesse-
oriented game. Lead by captains
Tad Van Leer, and high scorer
Bill Greg, the team posted an im-
pressive 6 and 1 record losing
only in the finals of the State
Tournament. Though All-Stater
Van Leer is a senior, along with
Clay Preston, the remainder of
the team include freshmen Scott
Duff, Biff Martin, Bob Newcomb,

Drew Pilsbury, and John Woods.
Upper class returnees include
sophomore All-Stater Keith
Romich as well as “Bullet” Bob
Marin, a junior. Goalie Bill
Meyers, who is the initiator of
the team’s drive for varsity status,
will also be returning. Apparently
there were also other contribu-
tors who did not cherish Coach
Stearns’s 3,000-yard-a-day swim
“warm-up” but participated reg-
ularly in team scrimmages. As a
result there’s a firm base of
competitors interested in making
next year’s team-—and who knows,
maybe there’s an O. J. Simpson-
like water polo player roaming
Big Lex, who, like the rest of the
campus, doesn’t even know W&L
has a water polo team.

So water polo isn’t officially a
varsity W&L sport? Considering
its current succes and future po-
tential, water polo should be a
welcome addition to the W&L
varsity sports program.

Charles Kuralt, Tom Wolfe,
Patrick Caddell and Vincent
Bugliosi head the list of speak-
ers for Contact ’77, according to
the co-chairmen of the commit-
tee.

Co-chairmen John Bruch and
Tom Murphy announced Tuesday
they are well underway in their
planning for this year’s Contact
program. According to Murphy,
Bugliosi and Kuralt have signed
contracts to appear this Winter
and a verbal agreement has been
reached with Caddell and Wolfe.

Three other speakers have been
contacted but have yet to sign any
contracts. Among them are a high
government official involved in
African affairs, a member of the
film industry, and a high rank-
ing officer of a major U.S. oil
company.

According to Murphy, it is un-
likely the goverfment official or
the oil company executive will
sign contracts prior to their ap-
pearance due to the nature of
their itineraries. But while their
appearance will remain in ques-
tion he does feel certain the other

_one will soon sign a contract.

Kuralt, who will speak on
March 22, is the CBS corrependent
who first conceived of the “On
the Road” series in 1967. When
the series first began it was in-
tended to be a short, three month
project.

The series was such a success
CBS continued it, and since that
time, Kuralt has logged many
hours “On the Road.”

A graduate of the University of
North Carolina, Kuralt began
writing for the “Charlotte News”
and was soon hired by CBS as
a newswriter. He advanced quick-
ly, moving first to Rio de Janeiro,
then to the West Coast and finally
to CBS News in New York.

Wolfe, a 1951 graduate of W&L,
served as editor of Shenandoah,
and The Southern Collegian as
well as sports editor of the Ring-
tum Phi. He was a member of
Phi Eta Sigma, the freshman
scholastic fraternity, and Phi
Kappa Sigma.

Aside from his writing for the
The Washington Post, the New
York Herald Tribune and New
York magazine, Wolfe has writ-

Parking problems

E.C. announces
unpleasant news

By REX NYQUIST

The decision was made, and
the decision stand§. There will
be no parking on either side of
the access road that runs in front
of the Woods Creeks Apartments,
Walt Kelley said at the E.C,
Meeting Monday night.

Kelley said the builders object
to the parking because it is “un-
aesthetic.” Assistant to the Presi-
dent Frank Parsons told him that
the administration has made the
decision and it will stand.

The University is considering
building a parking lot by the hea}
ing plant. However, it would not
be completed until next year at
the earliest. Parsons cited lack
of funds as the reason.

Rick Goddard, first-year Law
representative, asked if the E.C.
had undertaken an investigation
of the accident that resulted in
the injury of George Stadler dur-
ing a party at the SAE house.
Sandy Stradtman replied no, as
it was an accident and outside
of the E.C.’s jurisdiction. Stradt-
man is a member of SAE.

In other business, Jack Bovay
said the county sheriff's office is
going to start cracking down on
students who live outside of the
city and do not have county
stickers, and the E.C. appropri-
ated a $200 retainer for their
lawer last year, Tom Spencer.

By RICH LOVEGROVE

The students want convenient
parking facilities and in some
cases, just a parking space within
a few blocks of Woods Creek
Apartments.

The administration wants a
clutter free access road to the
law school and an overall aestheti-
eal layout for the apartment-law
school area.

So, while the school started
handing out parking tickets, some
of the students began tearing
down “No Parking” signs and
throwing bags of peat moss that
had been on the sidewalk for a
month down the hillside next, to
the West building.

The administration shot down
all hopes for irate Woods Creek
residents Monday when the Ex-
ecutive Committee was told that
there would be absolutely no
parking on the road leading to
the law school at any time.

Under the plan adopted for the
development of the law school-
apartment area, there was never
supposed to be any parking on the
road, according to Assistant to
the President Frank Parsons. The

Robert E. Huntley after consider-

Kolored Tangerine-Flake Stream-
line Baby and Radical Chic &
Mau-Mauing The Flak Catchers.

Wolfe has been called “super-
contemporary,” “parajournalistic”
and the “poet laureat of pop.” He
developed the “new journalism”
by incorporating a unique, irre-
verant jargon with a mixture of
metaphors.

This unique style emerged when
Wolfe was hurried to complete
an article for Esquire. He sat
down at his typewriter and simply
typed his notes which were print-
ed exactly as he typed them, in
what he calls the “wowie!”’ style.

Caddell has become one of the
most influential public opinion
researchers in the country. He
began his polling surveys while
still in high school and has since
conducted surveys for the Speaker
of the House of Represenatives in
Florida, Gov. John Gilligan of
Ohio, Sen, George MecGovern’s
presidential bid and President-
elect Jimmy Carter’s campaign.

Caddell is head of the Cam-
bridge Survey Research, Inc. and
was the youngest person included
in Time's 1974 list of 200 future
American leaders. He will speak
at W&L on Jan. 13.

Lewis Hall
of facilities

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

Undergrad students from W&L
have been misusing the facilities
in the law school, according to
law school oflicials.

It seems as though some under-
grads find the law school much
quieter and more suitable to
studying than the facilities avail-
able to them on the front campus.
But instead of acting as guests
should, some law people believe
that the undergrads have practic-
ally claimed squatters’ rights in
the law school.

The offences range from “squat-
ting” in some law students’ per-
sonal study ecarrels to having a
pizza party in the faculty lounge.
When asked to refrain from such
behavior, the students in ques-
tion beeame rude and refused to
comply with the requests, ac-
cording to Assistant Librarian
Sally Wiant.

The undergrads are not being
harassed or treated unfairly just
because they are undergrads, The
law students are subject to the

Quick question: What constitutes a “minority” at Washington and

Lee?
a. blacks
b. women

c, anybody who doesn't own khakis and topsiders

d. almost everybody

Best answer, according to John X. Miller: d
And Miller’s in a position to know, He's the co-chairman of the
Minority Affairs Coordinating Committee—better known to the few

who have heard of it as the MACC

Founded last year, the MACC tries to represent anyone who feels
his (or her) opinions are in the minority at W&L. That's what Miller,

a senior from Winston-Salem, N.C.,

says

And along with Co-Chairman

Mickey Knapp, he is trying to commit the MACC to that goal.
PHIL: To start. could you please explain the purpose of the MACC”
MILLER: Basically, it's a committee composed of eight people.
Its purpose is to take minority attitudes and preferences from the

student body

from anybody who feels that his ideas are in the

minority. Then, we present these ideas to the power structure of the
student body, such as the Executive Committee or other committees,

such as Contact.
We're a sounding board

Before, a lot of people in the student

body felt they didn’t have much power because they didn't have any

input inte the committees

PHL Well, what caused the EC to create this committee? Did it
ereate the MACC out of the goodness of its heart or was it forced into

this action

MILLER: It wos set up last year because some of the black stu
dents felt that they didn’t have any input inte the decision-making
process about entertainment on campus

1 drew up the proposal for the committee origin ally, along with
Scott Franklin and a couple of other guys off the EC, The EC created

the committee last November

We pushed for it because we felt that minority opinions here on
the campus needed some way to be voiced
PHI: Then the MACC was created because of pressure from blacks

Does it primarily serve blacks?

MILLER: No. Actually, the things we've mainly done so far have

been for the female students

Now

the committee must include at

least four minority students, Right now, its composed of four blacks,

author of the best-seller Helter
Skelter, will appear at W&L on
Mareh 16.

Since the Manson trial in 1969,
Bugliosi has himself been the ob-
ject of much publicity. After put-
ting Manson and four co-defend-
ents behind bars, Bugliosi re-
peatedly warned the F.B.I. that
Manson cultist “Squeaky” Framme
was out to get President Ford.

He was also instrumental in hav-
ing the file on Robert Kennedy
assasination reopened on the basis
of new evidence which he felt
pointed to Sirhan Sirhan’s frame-
up and the existence of a second
assassin.

According to Brush, the remain-
ing speakers will be announced as
soon as they have signed con-
tracts.

University installs

new phone system

By LEE HOWARD

W&L’s operator-assisted switch-
board telephone system was re-
placed over the summer by a
computer-operated business phone
system with greatly increased ca-
pacities and a number of new
functions.

The new digital switch system
was recommended to the Uni-
versity by both CENTEL and
Executone, a private business
phone supplier, after the uni-
versity went to them with a prob-
lem: The completion of the new
law school necessitated a greater
extension capacity than the exist-
ing system would allow. School
officials agreed for the sake of

not have its own phone system,
so a new phone system was need-
ed. There was also the existing
problem of faculty members hav-
ing to share the same extension
number, as wella s the need for
more extension numbers when
the new library was completed.

The digital switch system, a
file-cabinet size solid-state mini-
computer was selected for its
greater extension capacity, for its
long-distance direct-dialing ca-
pacity, and for other conveni-
ence features.

The new system inereased the
school’s capacity from 293 ex-
tensions and 13 outside-line trunk

same rules that are being set down
for the undergrads. Food and
drink are not permitted in the
library. The classrooms and
seminar rooms are off limits to
everyone at night, and the Faculty
library and lounge is always off
limits to students.

According to Wiant, “Those
rooms aren’t used as study areas.
The law students aren't allowed
to use them, and they become per-
turbed when they find non-law
students using them.”

As for the carrels, each law
student has been assigned one.
Those that haven't been assigned
wil be used in some other ca-
pacity in the near future. In es-
sence, the carrels are altogether
off limits to the undergrads.

This does not mean that the
undergrads are not welcome. Law
school and library policy, as it
stands now, states the “Under-
graduates are permitted to use
the resource materials of the law
library, and work in the Main
Reading Room.”

Law librarian Peyton Neal said
that undergrads are welcome so
long as they obey the regulations.
He stressed the issue of the car-
rels, and said that smoking and
food were permitted only in the
designated areas (of which there
are none for undergrads). He also
said that at times the undergrads
could work in the reference area.

Some concern was expressed
about the upcoming exam period
and crowding in the law library,
but that problem will be shelved
until the crisis actually arises.

The Dean of the School of Law,
R. L. Steinheimer, said the under-
graduates were welcome if their
work and research were related
to law. If undergrad should use
their facilities he expects them to
“act responsibly” and follow the
same rules the law students do.

The law law school doesn’t want
to have to lay down rules on the
use of certain areas by under-
grads. and won't as long as the
students maintain a considerate
regard for them, he said.

a girl, a Jewish student, and two Caucasians. So it isn’t just a com:

mittee for black students.

Blacks already have their vocal organ in SABU (the Student As-
sociation for Black Unity), so what we're trying to do is give some-
body else some input into the decision-making process

PHI; Was the MACC created to really help the minorities? Or
was it just a way to get the blacks off the EC's back?

MILLER: It might have been a little bit of both. I think when the
EC created it, it really didn’t think much could be accomplished with
this committee. But the people on our committee this year think a

lot ean be done with it.

PHI: Does the EC listen to what the MACC says?

MILLER: We haven't taken anything to the EC yet this year. We're
still working on a couple of matters we started last year

We're working on a pamphlet for the exchange students here.
When they get here, they don’t have anything. So we're doing that

Also, we're getting into a few other things here on campus. We're
discussing them right now, but we haven't made any decisions yet

We're just trying to get some input

Our members have been

appointed to seven different student committees. So when Contact
brings a speaker here, at least those students who don't feel they have
a voice really will have a voice in that decision

PHI: How would you gauge the general student reaction to this

type of minority activism?

MILLER: Well, for example, a lot of the white students I've dealt

with feel the university
enough

doesn't accommodate

When a white student comes here

the black students
he has an easier time

Socially for blacks, there's no much to do. And I think some of the

whites sympathize with us

On the other hand, some students probably don't like having any
black students here and they probably came here because they didn't
think there would be many black students here

PHL So the MACC js off to a start. How does its future look?

MILLER: I'm thankful the EC created it, even if it Was Just seen

as a token effort

But I think the future depends on the students on the committee
If those students are willing to actively seek the feeling of those
students not actively involved in the power structure here and if
they get input into the committees, then it will work

But if that doesn't oceur, then the MACC will just exist to satisfy

the EC

Thursday, December 2, 1976

Prospects

\nd so it begins. Systems fail. The sun grows dark, Chaos

creeps over the world. Rational men lose their wits and dash
madly about babbling incoherently. Babies ery. Dogs howl.

The moon ts blood red.

That's right,

frenzied activity :

brothers
reading twelve weeks worth

eCxXains are Upon us.

Two weeks of
of assignments

in four or five courses, writing term papers for perhaps as

many. All this and probably more (extracurricular activities-

Winter sports, Contact, editing a newspaper or two) while

trying to maybe sort of begin to perhaps start studying for

four of those three-hour mental torture sessions called exams.

Right.

Why is it, exactly, that the most grueling period of the term

invariably falls just before those all-important and most hol)

examinations? Term papers should not only be assigned at

the start of the term, they should be made due by the middle.

The workload of a given course should be lightest, not heaviest,

at the end so that proper preparations for exams can be made.

But this, of course, would go against tradition.

Somehow, though, we all seem to pull through this semi-
annual trial with little or no ill effects, Oh, there might be
a nervous breakdown or two along the way, perhaps a suicide,

and a few faces might be missing when we return in January.
No matter, Life, which at this point is mostly school, goes on.

There are, of course, consolations, depending on how far
in advance one is able to look at a time like this when the

immediate takes on such vast importance, In the almost fore-

sceable future lies the prospect of Christmas break, \lthough

somewhat shorter this year than usual, this vacation continues

to hold the promise of good times enjoyed with almost no

thought of college to dampen the spirits, Pity the student at

a school like Brown, where exams still come after the break.

Kinda take the

fun out of things, wouldn't it?

Then there's the Winter term. Terms are always great for

about three weeks when you can get a way with doing nothing

at all. But by the end of January we'll remember that the

faculty in ther infinite concern and generosity decided not to
vive us (and themselves) any sort of break during that long,

long term

\ll this means is that a few more classes than

usual will be missed (coincidently) during Mardi Gras, Faney
Dress always serves to brighten the horizon for a while, if

you don't mind spending a lot of money. And then come those

four term papers and exams again . .

. but let's not dwell on

future tragedies. For the day is sufficient unto itself and all

that.
\t any rate

with fear and trepidation bh

wdering on de

spair, we at the Ring-tum Phi offer our best wishes for su
cess during the coming onslaught, and hope that we may be

included in such a happy fate,

UT's Faustus innovative, powertul

By RICHARD S. WOLF

The University Theatre is pre-
senting the second play of its
season this week, Christopher
Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus. Will
Cantler, directing the play as his
senior drama thesis, has brought
the classic tragedy to the Troub
with a lively seript and some
of the best ensemble work to be
seen at W&L in years. The major
problem facing any producer of
Elizabethean drama is to avoid
letting the play drag. The present
production does a masterful job
of conquering this, but in doing
so has lost sight of some of the
more minor concerns. This alone
keeps Cantler’s production from
achieving excellence.

There are several aspects of the
production that are at first so
unique as to be disturbing. But
most of these resolve themselves
and prove to be quite effective.
The first surprise is to see Dan
Scott (of Richard Henry Lee fame)
in the title role. One usually en-
visions Faust as a wizened old
devil-worshiper and is understand-

Who’s Who
Dear Editor:

Having just read Mr. Meschutt’s
lelter eriticizing the candidates
for inelusion in Who’s Who in
American Colleges and Universi-
ties has prompted me to write
this.

It seems that-Mr. Meschutt be-
lieves the contributions made to
this University not of a totally
academic nature constitute medio-
crity and therefore deserve no
recognition.

Let me remind him that both
Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron
Delta Kappa are set aside to
recognize those who Mr. Meschutt
admires.

Who's Who does not require
that a student excell solely in
academia. All too often we hold
the ability to receive good grades
so high that we are not able to
laud the achievements made by
students in areas which constitute
leadership, stamina and dedica-
tion to purpose.

I believe the qualities that are
necessary to sueced in areas aside
from academia are worthy of
recognition. Those students seen
only behind library stacks are
perhaps more likely candidates
for Who's He?

Vandalism

Dear Ring-tum Phi:

Your editorial, “Privacy” in last
week's Phi, really hit the nail on
the head. Earlier in the year, I
wrote a letter regarding an inci-
dent in. whieh a ear was vand-
alized by a “townie.” Unfortun
ately, the article was taken to be
a critique of the parking facilities,
‘or lack of them) when in fact,
privacy was and is the point. Just
iwo days after the letter was pub

ably shocked to find him looking
like a sixteenth century version
of Tab Hunter. But it isn’t long
before Scott’s superb acting con-
vinees us that Faustus should look
this way. If one adjective could
be used to describe Scott's per-
formance, it would be powerful;
perhaps too powerful. He brings
to the role such emotion and yet,
at the same time control, that
most of the other charaeters seem
to wither in his presence.

This is particularly and unfor-
tunately true of Mephistophilis,
played by Emily Reid, a first year
law student. This messenger of
the Devil should be a pure per-
sonification of evil power and
diabolic intellect. Instead, Reid
gave us a smug smile and an
obnoxious laugh that could hardly
pass at satanic. She could not
convince us that she held the
power of Hell, and this in turn,
kept Faustus’ fall from being as
pathetic and frightening as it
should have been. At first glance
this problem may seem to be the
result of Mephistophilis being

lished, my winter coat was stolen.
No more than a week after that,
a C.B. radio antenna was taken
off an. auto. All these. incidents,
as well as those which are not
known to me, all support my be-
lief that a drastic change is called
for on our campus.

W&L is a private institution
and only those having legitimate
business on the campus should be
here. Why should we allow our-
selves to be taken advantage of?
There must be a solution which
will not deprive us of an open
campus. The stealing and vand-
alism we are being subjected to
must stop!

At Natural Bridge, Sandy
Stradiman presented to the class
of °80, a magnificent speech in
which we were told that acts of
erime are extinct at W&L. The
freshmen have been toid that they
should not be concerned for the
safety of their possesions when
left behind and to feel safe in
assuming that they may be found
the next day in the same spot
thev were left in. Well, the class
of ‘80 has been forced to learn
the hard way what a farce that
is! They have continually been
subjected to crime by those out-
side the W&L community.

The E.C. should get on the
ball and open their eyes to this
atrocity. When the problem is
realized in full, then maybe the
E.C. will act, if we raise enough
cain, then people may take notice.
Talk to your class rep. about the
matter and urge him to raise the
wtbject before the E.C. When we
have eliminated such outlandish
conduet by the W&L community
why should we put up with it
from outsiders? | am very upset
about this problem and I'm sure
vou agree, so let's join together
to check this problem before it
‘ets more out of hand!

NOTICES

As a service to Washington and
Lee students, the University has
once again this year engaged
Baldridge Reading and Study
Skills. Inc. te offer on campus a
special program designed to im
prove reading and learning skills
in academic subjects.

The program is not merely a
speed-reading course. Its techni
ques are designed to increase
reading speed, to strengthen com-
prehension, to improve recall, to

sustain concentration and to
deepen analysis. A student uses
his own classroom reading ma

terials rather than mass-prepared
instructional literature and me
chanical training aids

This program will be conducted
on the Washington and Lee cam
pus by an instructor from Bald
ridge Reading from January 10
through February 4. Scheduling
will be flexible to accommodate
individual student schedules, and
classes will be email to permit
necessary individual atention
Each student will attend a total
of twenty sessions, five per week
Tuition for the program will be
$75, payable by the start of the
program upon receipt of a state
ment from Baldridge

Further information and regi
stration cards may be obtained
from the Office of the Dean of
Students, Washington Hall 25
Interested students should regi

ster for the course as soon as

possible.

cast as a woman. But, though this
is an initial surprise, Reid did an
overall good job with the difficult
role and manged to efface her
gender. The basic problem in her
relationship with Faustus was
that she could not equal his level
of stage presence. Whether this is
her fault, or Seott’s for being too
powerful, I am not sure, but I
think the former.

A masterful stroke of Cantler’s
was to have some 33 terciary roles
played by a company of eight
actors. This resulted in some fine
character portrayals, particularly
by Brad Liston and Hugh Sisson.

This production marks the
debut of the Drama Departments
new set and technical designer,
Tom Ziegler. If the set for Faustus
is any indication of the work

_ that the

that Ziegler usually does, some-
one should give this man tenure
before he escapes. This is the
most original and successful set
Troub has housed for
some time. It is a multi-tiered
affair with a run-way down the
length of the theatre, upon which
there was some effective staging.
Ziegler is also responsible for the
mavelous posters for the play.

Overall, this production of
Doctor Faustus is a very suc-
cessful one. Besides the major
problem of an imbalance between
Faustus and Mephistophilis, the
play was excellent. With the Uni-
versity Theatre having now pre-
sented two very well done plays,
I anxiously await Who‘’s Afraid of
Virginia Woolf, to be offered next
semester.

 

Charles Porterfield Light, Jr.

 

Charles Porterfield Light Jr.,
a teacher for 47 years in the
School of Law and its dean for
eight, died Nov. 19 following
a long illness. He was 73.

Dean Light was one of
W&L’s legendary figures, and
his influence reached to the
highest levels of the legal pro-
fession. When he retired from
teaching in 1973,-he received
accolades from Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger and from
Supreme Court Justice Lewis
F. Powell Jr., whom Dean Light
had taught at Washington and
Lee.

His principal fields of teach-
ing were constitutional and ad-
ministrative law and _ torts.
More than 100 of his alumni—
“the Light brigade”—currently
hold federal judgeships. Two
of his students were elected
presidents of the American Bar
Association, Mr, Powell and the
late Ross L. Malone. Many of
America’s largest corporations
have Dean Light's graduates as
their general counsel.

Ile was born Dee. 29, 1902,
in Martinsburg, W.Va., the son
of the late Charles Porterfield
and Margaret Harlan Light, He
was a 1923 graduate of Virginia
Military Institute and earned
his law degree in 1926 from
Harvard University. He join-
ed the W&L law faculty in that
year. In 1928, V.M.1. awarded

 

Dean Light dies at 73

him an M.A. degree for post-
graduate work in _ political
science.

He became dean of the W&L
law school in 1960. He firs!
stepped down from that post
in 1967, when he reached 65,
the mandatory retirement age
for administrators, and re-
sumed fulldime teaching.

But his retirement from the
deanship turned out to be
short-lived. He had been suc-
ceeded by Robert E. R. Huntley

who also had studied under
Dean Light—but less than a
year later, Huntley was elect-
ed W&L president, and. Dean
Light was called back into ser-
vice as law dean until a perma-
nent suceessor could be named.

President Huntley comment-
ed: “Dean Light’s death is an
incalculable loss to me_per-
sonally, and to his other col
leagues and alumni and
friends. And it is that kind of
loss not only to Washington
and Lee, but also to the legal
profession he served so long
and in so many exemplary
ways

“I was his student and fae-
ulty colleague: he was my dean,
and a short while | was even
his dean. And most important
of all, he was my friend, a
friendship I have always trea-
sured deeply—and which | will
remember warmly, and miss so
much.”

Generals look for NCAA berth

This year’s Washington and Lee
basketball team has two primary
goals to attain. The first is to
win twenty games, and the sec-
ond is to receive a bid to the
NCAA Division Il national
championship playoffs. These are
difficult but very attainable goal’s
for this year’s team. If they don’t
reach them it will have to be
considered a disappointing season.

Two years ago the Generals had
a 15-12 record but lost all but
a few of the games in the second
half of the season. They received
a surprising but not very well
deserved bid to the NCAA play-
offs. Last year’s team, with a 19-7
record, a VCAA_ championship,
and the coach and player of the
year in the state of Virginia, did
not receive a bid. It was a bitter
disappointment to the players.
They very much deserved a bid,
and would have received one if
the regional selection committee
had not been overruled by the
national office. This year’s team
wants the bid they missed last
year and they want it badly. They
will strive to prove beyond a

doubt that they cannot be over-
looked by the NCAA at the end
of the year.

The situation is somewhat dif-
ferent this season in that W&L
is now a member of the Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference. By
winning the conference champion-
ship the Generals can receive an
automatic bid to the Division II
Southwest Regional Tournament.
The competition wil Ibe tough,
however, particularly from Lynch-
burg and Hampden-Sydney, both
of whom return most of their
players from last year’s teams.
Bridgewater, Eastern Menonite,
and Emory and Henry round out
the league. The top four teams,
based on regular season record,
will play in the ODAC champion-
ship tournament on Feb. 25. and
26 in Doremus.

Coach Canfield’s co-captains
this year are Bob Flint and Kim
Sims. Both lead through setting
examples of steadiness and hard
work. Flint started the entire
season last year at the strong
forward position, and was the
team’s leading rebounder. He is
particularly quick near the basket.
Sims started many games last year
as well as the year before. He has
always been an excellent de-
fensive player and has recently
developed a fine long-range jup
shot. Both players will fill promi-
nent roles in the Generals’ pro-
gress as the season develops.

One of Coach Canfield’s trade-
marks throughout the years has
been to consistently play ten men
in every game. The result has
been that he has a strong bench,
and is two or more deep with
solid ball players at every posi-
tion. This year’s Generals are no
exception in this respect.

At the point guard position, in
addition to Sims, he has Mike
Wenke and Bob Forlenza. All
three have extensive playing ex-
perience, and all three are small,
quick, and excellent defensive
players and ball handlers. There
are differences, however. Wenke
is a motor mouth and loves to
drive to the basket. Forlenza,

coming back from an off-season
shoulder operation, is more
effective as an outside shooter.

The shooting guard position is
held down primarily by Pat
Dennis, He sat on the bench last
year behind All-American John
Podgajny and this year he’s
hungry to show what he can do.
He has a very quick outside
jumper which very few teams will
be able to stop. In addition, he’s
an excellent rebounder. He'll be
backed by junior newcomer Ea-
man Cassell. Though only 511”,
Cassell is a strong jumper and a
good defensive player. He passed
up football this year in order to
play basketball and he should
make a valuable contribution to
the team.

The forward position may be
the strongest on the team. Man-
ning it are Dave Leumig and
Chris Larson, and both are fine
ball players. Leunig is more
steady while Larson is more
spectacular. Leunig has has all
the sound fundamentals neces-
sary to the position. He’s aggres-
sive, he rebounds and he has an
effective medium range shooting
touch. Larson has the potential
to score twenty or more points
in any given game. He has a
very soft outside shot as well as
quick driving moves to the basket.
The most overlooked strength in
his game is his uncanny ability
to hit the open man inside with
a sharp pass.

This year’s team has three cen-
ters. Six-foot-nine, two hundred
and thirty pound Don Berlin is
returning for his fourth year of
varsity action. He’s not very fast
getting up and down the court
but he’s quick and strong near the
basket. Sophomore Ardith Collins
is a strong defensive player and
shot rejector, and has an effective

‘turnaround jumper. Senior Steve

Hand is returning to the Generals
after two years off and will pro-
vide valuable team leadership
both on the court and off. His
array of hook shots is very dif-
ficult to stop.

Jim Berlin, Don’s brother, will

ward position this year. He’s a

playing strong forward, as well as

Swimming
The W&L swimming Generals
won an exhibition dual meet with
the Briarwood A.A.A.U. Club of
Richmond, 72-23, and _ finished
fourth out of ten teams in the
Millersville Relays Nov. 13.

The highlight of both meets
was the fact that senior co-captain
Tad Van Leer, and W&L’s 800
free relay team composed of Van
Leer, Chip Hoke, Keith Romich,
and co-captain John Hudson,
qualified for the National Champ-
ionships based on their times in
the meets. Van Leer also qualified
in the 50 yard freestyle. W&L
came up with some excellent
early season times that had head
coach Bill Stearns smiling.

Individual winners against the
Briarwood Club ineluded Drew
Pillsbury in the 200 individual
medley, the 200 backstroke, and
the medley relay, Romich in the
200 free and the 200 butterfly,
Van Leer in the 50 free and med-
ley relay, Hudson in the 500 free,
Seott Duff in the 100 free and
medley relay, and Peter Meem in
the 200 breaststroke and medley
relay.

W&L finished fourth in the
Millersville Meet behind East
Stroudsburg, Glassboro State, and
Bloomsburg State. The 400 yard
butterby relay team of Duff, Van
Leer, Romich and Hudson cap-
tured the Generals’ only first place
award.

Wrestling

The W&L grapplers are aiming
to make 1976-77 their third con-
secutive winning season. The Gen-
erals finished at 8-7 in dual meet
competition last season, and third
place in the Virginia College
Athletic Association. The team is
a member of the first year Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
this season, along with Eastern
Mennonite, Hampden-Sydney, and
Lynchbourg College.

Coach Gary Franke sets as the
teams’ '76-77 goals that of another
winning season, and to bring the
first O.D.A.C. wrestling title to
Lexington. The Generals have 12
dual meets scheduled this year,
as well as six tournament appear-

ances. The coach cites Duke,
George Mason, Colgate, and cros-
town rival V.M.I. as the most
challenging non-conference op-
ponents, and Lynchburg as the
most difficult team in the O.D.
A.C, Included in the six tourneys
are the W&L Invitational, the
Citadel Tournament in Charles-
ton, S.C., and the Pembroke State
Invitational in Pembroke, N.C.

The Generals lost 126 lb. Lee
Keck and 167 lb. Rich Heldrick
to graduation. The returnees are
led by captain Jim Crytzer at 158
Ib., Kevin McFadden at 167 Ib.,
and Dan Kniffen in the heavy-
weight class. Freshmen who could
make major contributions in their
first season include Boyd Breed-
ing at 118, Ray Gross at 142, and
Todd Wohler at 167.

The ’76-77 Generals are think-
ing optimisitically about the
O.D.A.C. crown, as well as hoping
for a strong showing in the N.C.
A.A. Division III Championships
to be held at the State Uni-
versity of New York at Bingham-
ton on March 3-5.

Soccer

Junior Mark Derbyshire and
Mark Bennett have been named
the co-captains elect of the 1977
soecer Generals. Derbyshire, also
a captain this past season, is a
halfback from Baltimore, and also
plays lacrosse at W&L.

Bennett is a goalkeeper from
Neptune City, New Jersey, and is
the school record holder for most
saves in one game, one season,
and in a career. The 1976 soccer
Generals recently completed their
season with a 3-10 mark.

Under the direction of Coach
Rolf Piranian, W&L is conducting
an indoor soccer program during
the winter months. The team mem-
bers have been split into four
groups and wil leompete for the
W&L indor soccer championship.

New phone system is more efficient Woods Creek: no parking

cables to 350 extensions and 21
outside lines.

The new system’s direct dial
capabilities was a compelling fea-
ture. Under the old system, all
long-distance calls had to be
operator-assisted, which cost the
university extra money. But there
have been problems with the new
direct-dialing feature. The uni-
versity did not want everyone to
have the direct dialing option for
fear of abuse. It was more difficult
than either the phone company or
the university imagined to limit
the direct dialing capabilities to
certain phones. As it stands now
the operator has to make out slips

for every long-distance call that is
made.

Some of the convenience fea-
tures of the new phone system
include:

Camp-On: If you dial a busy
number within the university,
dialing 1 tells the person you are

trying to reach that he has
another call.
Automatic Callback: If you

reach a busy number, dialing 2
tells the computer to call you
back as soon as the other person
is off the phone. When you an-
swer, the computer automatically
rings the number you were try-
ing to reach.

A new record album featuring
the W&L Glee Club performing
songs about W&L has just been
released.

In addition to a number of
W&L standards, including “The
W&L Swing” and “Fight, Fight,
Blue and White,” the album con-
tains the premiere performance
of a new music-and-narrative
composition about W&L’s 227-
year history, “This Good Land
For Our Heritage.”

In addition to the Glee Club
songs, the album also contains
two numbers—“The Swing” and
“Fight, Fight,” W&L’s most fam-
ous “fight” songs—played on the
piano by Mrs. Frederick M. P.
Pearse. Mrs. Pearse’s renditions

where she works as a hostess and
where the album was recorded.

Four of the songs were written
by the late John A. Graham, a
W&L teacher from 1919 until his
death in 1947—“Fight, Fight”:
“Hold ’Em, Gen'rals”; “Onward
For Alma Mater” and “The Only
Girl.” Graham was director of the
W&L theatre and glee club for
many years.

The album is available from
the University Record Store (in
the same building as the Book-
store between the old freshman
dormitories and McCormick Li-
brary). The cost is $5, which in-
cludes sales tax.

used in emergency situations and

operator. If she reaches a busy
line, in an emergency situation
she may cut into somebody’s con-
versation.

Consultation Hold: Allows you
to keep a person on hold while
you are consulting with someone
else. There have been problems
with this holding technique be-
cause you cannot hold the cradle
button down for more than 1%
seconds, or less than % second.

Transferring calls: You may
transfer calls from one person to
another by putting a person on
hold, then dialing another per-
son’s number and hanging up.

Call Forwarding: Allows a per-
son to forward a call to another
number automatically.

The contract to install the new
phone system was given to CEN-
TEL rather than Executone be-
cause the initial capital outlay
for equipment was too great for
the university to afford if they
had to buy the equipment. CEN-
TEL charges a monthly rental fee
for the equipment and also pro-
vides better maintainance.

However they were not very
helpful in training the people
who had to use the phones. Terry
Atwood has filled that gap by
teaching class every day on the
use of the new equipment. He
also serves as W&L’s liaison with
the phone company.

The new system costs $700 more
per month; $3000 per month vs.
$2300 for the old system. Mosi
people believe it’s worth it.

ing several plans, called for
aesthetic development of the
area, Parsons said.

The administration wanted a
two-way access road to the law
school, one that would be free
from the clutter of parked cars,
Parsons said. They also felt that
they could not provide enough
parking spaces that would meet

‘safety standards to justify the

cost, accordin gto Parsons.

Both Parsons and Dean John
agree that much of the student
animosity stems from allowing
students to park along the road
and across from the apartments
last year and part of this year and
then changing to a no parking
policy.

Parking was allowed last year,
becatise the administration felt
the students would compain about
not being able to park in an un-
used area, Parsons said, refering
to a strip of land across from
Woods Creek that was dirt last
year but is now filled with bould-
ers and trees.

Students were also allowed to
park on the road much of this
year. But after the road was
paved the administration began
handing out tickets.

Most Woods Creek dwellers are
unhappy with the situation. Many
enjoyed the convenience of park-
ing in front of the apartments,
while some simply cannot find a
parking place behind the gym dur-
ing week days.

But most are upset because they
feel the administration ignored
student opinions in making their
decision.

One student said he is annoyed
with the way the administration
used the available space. He said
he particularly dislikes the use
of large boulders where there
could have been parking. His
sentiments have been echoed by
many students who. live in Woods
Creek and feel that the money
used for landscaping could have
complete it quickly this fall.

to finish the job this summer to are justified. They said they do

provided parking.

Parsons said he was unable to
isolate the cost of moving the
rocks and dirt from the total cost
of the law school project but he
estimated that the planting of
trees cost approximately $34,000.

Several students have complain-
ed about the slow pace at which
the construction has been com-
pleted. One senior said he was
annoyed that the work was not
done during the summer. Others
said they thought three months
was too long to pave a road, lay
a sidewalk, move in dirt and
boulders and plant trees. Accord-
ing to Parsons the contractor was
unable to get the people necessary

Parsons and John said they do
not think most student complaints

not consider the walk from the
gym parking lot to the apartments
too long, particularly compared to
the distance students at other
schools are required to walk. John
also said he thinks there is gen-
erally enough room to park in
the gym lot.

Parsons and John both said
that the current parking situation
is not permanent but emphasized
that parking will never be allow-
ed on the access road. More
parking areas will be studied
“when construction and finances
allow,” said John.

Meanwhile Woods Creek resi-
dents will have to get used to
walking from the gym to their
apartments and occasionally shell-
ing out money for parking tickets.

by DOUG DEWING

Livingston Taylor and the At-
lanta Rhythm Section will be the
performers for this vear’s Winter
concert, according to sources on
the Student Activities Board.

The concert is tentatively sche-
diled for Friday, Jan. 21, in the

SAB co-chairmen Mike Armstrong
refused to confirm the idenity of
the acts and would only say that a

Monday night’s E. C. meeting
was the scene of a heated discus-
sion between first-year law repre-

fred Robinson, President of the In-
ter-Fraternity Council.

Goddard asked Robinson why
the IFC had not investigated an
accident that occurred at the SAE
ifalloween party. Robinson replied
that the Student Control Commit-
tee had looked into it, but that the
IFC had not and would not, as the
incident was purely accidental

This explanation did not satisfy
Goddard, who said an investiga-
‘(ion would bring out the facts. He
said he could not accept the Ring-

an efficient explanation of the
event.

Kappa Alpha to gain charter

by REID SLAUGHTER

After two years as a provisional
chapter, the historic Kappa Alpha
Order at W&L wil receive a new
charter in January, perhaps signi-
fying a new era for KA.

Once considered to be the stron-
gest house on campus, the Alpha
Chapter of KA enjoys a rich his-
tory dating back to 1865, when
four Washington College students
founded the order. They named
President Robert E. Lee as its

E. C. rep.
for probe

currence was an accident, asked
Goddard why he had waited so
long to bring the matter up. He
also stated that an investigation
would tediously drag the matte:
on, possibly causing emotional
hardships for the persons involved
in the incident.

Robinson suggested that God-
dard should question the officers
of the fraternity in private, rather
than push for an investigation

Walt Kelley then pointed out
that the discussion was pointless
as the IFC did not have to investi
gate

Goddard explained to Robinson
that he was new to W&L and still
unsure how all the commiitees
worked, and he had thought an in
vestigation might be fruitful

spiritual leader, as he was thought
to be “the embodiment of a true
Southern gentleman” and a mode!
for every KA member.

In more recent years, KA got
literally too big for itself. Factions
and cliques developed and soon,
torn by dissension among its mem-

bers and frustrated by financial
straits, the house collapsed in
1970. The house itself was sold,

and most of the remaining mem-

bers drifted into other fraterni-
ties.
In 1974, Matt Donaldson, the

current president, and cight oth
ers decided to revive KA. Dissatis-
fied with certain aspects of other
fraternities, the group wanted to
form their own approach to fra-
ternity life. With some financial
backing they were able to lease
the old Psi Upsilon house on Nel-
son St. and began operating from
there last year.

There had been many attempts
to restore the KA chapter to W&L,
but this was the first successful
attempt. It was not an easy task
however.

One week before school ended

thot first year, the house found
out it would be allowed to go

through Rush the next year, as a
provisional house. After a long
summer of preparation, the KA’s
went through Rush and gained
six pledges. This year, they went
through Rush as a_ provisional
house again, and gained 18

full active status

Craun named
assistant dean

Dr. Edwin D. Craun, assistan!

named to a three-year term as as-
sistant dean of The College

W&L, Oxford
to trade profs

Oxford Univer.ity’s oldest com
ponent, University College, and
W&L have announced a faculty-
exchange program, to be inaugui
ated next fall.

Under the program, professors
from the prestigious British uni
versity will spend a term or a
full academic year  teac hing
classes at W&L. In turn, W&L pro
fessors will have the opportunity
to spend sabbaticals at Oxford.
principally to conduct research.

The program announced

onday on the occasion of a visit
to W&L by the retired master of
University College, Lord Red
cliffe-Maud.

The W&L-Oxford exchange was
developed in large measure by
Redcliffe-Maud, who retired last
summer after 16 years as master,
and Dr. Leonard E. Jarrard, pro-
fessor of psychology at W&L, who
spent the 1975-76 academic year
at University College.

Dr. William J. Watt,

dean of

The College, deseribed the un-
usual new exchange program as

‘a Most extraordinary opportunity
for Washington and Lee’s faculty
and, certainly, for our students—
and, we hope, for the faculty and

udents at University College as
well.”

Automatic Rule regs

The Committee on the Automa-
tic Rule will meet at 10:30 a.m. on
Wednesday, December 22, 1976.
At that time the Committee will
consider the following groups of
students, who have fallen under
the Automatic Rule, for possible
immediate reinstatement:

1. those students who failed to

meet the conditions of Aca

demic Probation required of
them at the end of the cur
rent Fall Term.

2. those students completing a
full academic year who failed
to meet the cumulative aver
ige required of their class

The Committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement all
rudents who fall under the Avto-
matic Rule. If any student wishes
to inform the Committee of ex
tenuating circumstances present

gathering require—and is there
any money left from this year?
Trump: What we're shooting for
is to try and keep it around the
figure because money is
ht right now in all areas of the
‘conomy. We're going to try to
keep it as minimal as we can and

ime

vel try to do as good a job as we
were able to do in 1976

Parking war continues;
EC. Washington Hall
conference yields plan

by JOE FITZGERALD

They paved paradise but will
not put up a parking lot.

They may, however, decide to
designate at least one lot for use
by Woods Creek residents only.

That was the upshot of a meet
ing Monday afternoon between a
bare quorum of the Executive
Committee and a delegation from
Washington Hall.

The E.C. met with President
R.E.R. Huntley, Assistant to the
President Frank Parsons, Dean of
Students Lewis John and Tom
Borellis, a representative of the
Pittsburg landseaping firm which
designed the layout of the lunar
landscape across the apartments.

Huntley said the area across the
street from the apartments had
not been used for parking because
it was neither scenic to have the
cars sitting there nor safe to have
them backing out of perpendicu-
lar spaces into the access road.
One Woods Creek dweller,
Jim Falk, did not agree that back
ing into the road would create a
safety hazard. “I liked the way
they talked about that little road
like it was an interstate,” he said
later

\nother apartment resident
Peter Keefe, argued that the
placement of rocks (.e., massive
boulders, paving stones for a
transAtlantic footbridge) across
the road might also be unsafe in
that it would inerease the inci
dents of snakes around the apart

Borellis replied that there were

Keefe responded that the rep

2 THE RING-TUM PH

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

Thursday, December 9, 1976

The State
of the Arts

Beginning when we return for the Winter term, the Ring-
tum Phi will present a special series of feature articles,

It is our project to examine the status of the fine arts at
Washington and Lee. Each article will deal with a specific
facet of artistic expression. University and community spon-
sored programs and courses will be highlighted as well as the
various individual and independent projects of members of
the University community.

The point of such a project? There are several questions we
hope to answer, others we intend to raise, In the first category:
What has been the historical role of the arts at W&L? What
has been the traditional attitude of various groups in the Uni-
versity toward the arts? What impact have artistic endeavors
had on the University? To this end, the Ring-tum Phi will ex-
amine the histories of the arts at W&L, through the records of
various artistic groups as well as our own back issues, which
extend back several decades, fot a glimpse at the University’s
past artistic achievements and the reactions to them.

Close attention will be paid to the current status of the arts
at W&L. What opportunities now exist for persons to express
themselves artistically? Is participation in the arts encouraged,
discouraged, or left to the individual? What physical facilities
are there for the arts? What kinds of courses are offered, and
what specifically are people doing now in and for the arts? The
Ring-tum Phi will talk to the people most closely involved in
the arts: the teachers of course, the sponsors of programs, and,
most important, the individuals who work at the arts because
they believe that the arts are important, the sidemen: actors,
musicians, stage hands and page-turners, and all the others who
devote their spare time or their whole careers to the fine arts.
\nd we'll hear from people who choose to remain outside the
artistic community, and see their reasons for doing so.

This examination of the past and present cannot help but
raise questions about the future. Are there possibilities for the
arts at W&L which have not yet been realized? What projects
are now just beginning? What hope do artists have of encour-
agement and fulfillment here in the future?

One question is particularly interesting: What, i/ anything,
is being done to expand the scope of artistic achievement at
W&L? What plans, if any, are being made to insure that the
arts will flourish and find a home here? | refer specifically to
the current lack of adequate facilities on campus for the fin
arts. A garage and a boiler room make interesting lut hara!
ideal theaters. Serious students of music are left almost entire-
ly to their own devices. Most schools of comparable size, assets
and quality have at least one building devoted entirely to the
fine or performing arts. Yale has one of the most respected re-
pertory groups in the nation,

What is and is not being done? What can be done? Is the
power of commerce so great at W&L that it leaves the arts
languishing in oblivion, General questions, perhaps difficult

ones, but certainly important ones,

Chi Psi: “gentleman’s fraternity”

by BILL THOMSON

Inspired by the success Kappa
Alpha has achieved in reestablish-
ing its Alpha chapter and with the
intention of providing more diver-
sity in the fraternity system, four
students are working to charter
a branch of the Chi Psi social fra-
ternity at Washington and Lee.

“W&L is the kind of institution
that Chi Psi would like to associ-
ate itself with,” said Bill Stanzel,
one of the co-founders. Stanzel, as-
serting that Chi Psi chapter would
fulfill a definite need in the W&L
community, said that the frater-
nity’s goal is diversity in acade-
mics and leadership. Actual work
to establish a chapter has just
started in the past two weeks.
“We don’t want to rush,” Stanzel
said, “and we want to leave the
doors open as much as possible.

Chi Psi national and Stanzel
agreed in September to try to get
the ball rolling. Stanzel contacted
fellow seniors John Palda and
Kirk Ruffin and junior Peter
Keefe with the aim of setting up
“an alternative fraternity.” The
four joined forces as co-founders
and became pledges a week be-
fore Thanksgiving at a ceremony
attended by two officials of Chi
Psi national. Hoping that they will
gain nine or ten pledges during
the Winter term, initiation cere-
monies have been tentatively plan-
ned for February or March at the
Chi Psi house at Chapel Hill.

Nickel €? Diamond Theater

By the end of the year (when
Stanzel, Palda and Ruffin will
graduate), they hope to have 12 to
15 students involved with Chi Psi.
None of the co-founders have had
any previous experience with soc-
ial fraternities, but they have
been getting help from both fac-
ulty members and students. The
English department’s George Ray,
a Chi Psi brother, will be ‘“‘a great
help” according to Stanzel. Dean
John is helping to get the frater-
nity off the ground by offering
names of students who might be
interested in joining Chi Psi, and
Carter Greer, former Kappa Alpha
president, has offered to help in
any way he can.

Stanzel said that at the same
time the national is looking for a
suitable chapter house, the co-
founders are seeking appropriate
members from the W&L student
body.

But wait a minute—there. is
something ~radically different
about this proposed fraternity. Al-
though descriptions of Chi Psi in-
clude the predictable terms (“di-
versity” and “well-rounded” and
so on), one term sets it apart from
other fraternities. “Chi Psi has
been a conservative organization
in the past,” said Stanzel. “‘Al-
though we are not looking for a
specific ‘type’ of member, Chi Psi
is a gentleman’s fraternity.”

A gentleman’s fraternity. Per-
haps that goal is one of the con-

tributing factors to Stanzel’s opi-
nion that, in his eyes, there is no
Chi Psi-type fraternity at Wash-
ington and Lee. No one can deny
that a gentleman’s fraternity bas-
ed on leadership and academics
would be a remarkable innova-
tion.

“Social activities are impor-
tant, but I don’t believe they are
the most important function of a
fraternity,” said Stanzel. “I don’t
want to label it yet,” he said. He
said that as many students as pos-
sible would be interviewed as the
fraternity is starting out, but add-
ed that the co-founders are look-
ing for quality over quantity.

It appears that Chi Psi will have
to select its membership from
three basic groups of independent
students: those who did not parti-
cipate in Rush because they were
not interested in joining a frater-
nity, those who went through
Rush and did not end up joining
any fraternity, and those who
have never seriously considered
joining a fraternity. Stanzel thinks
that “a lot of good people” are
available from these groups. He
says that Chi Psi will have a lot to
offer, and hopes to attract stu-
dents through the fraternity’s
“different images.”

In carefully selecting potential
brothers, the co-founders want to
avoid “setting up blockades”;
since three of the four co-founders
will leave W&L after this year,

features Thurber comedy

by M. GRAY COLEMAN

It is a little known fact around
campus that there are two theater
groups, not one, housed in the
ground level of the Old Main
Building. One is the Boiler Room
Theater, a branch of the W&L
Drama Department, and scene of
this November’s production of
Uncle Vanya. But, there is one

_ other group with a somewhat dif-

ferent character: the Nickel &
Diamond Theater. According to
their prospectus, it is “by design
and philosophy determined to
bring innovative dramatic produc-
tions and educational projects at
a low cost to Lexington and the

surrounding areas, by drawing on -

local talent and support to build
a theater that is truly a commun-
ity effort.” The members explain
their presence as an opportunity
for local residents and students to
present ideas for shows, direct, or
act in them.

The Nickel & Diamond Theater
is a non-profit organiation run by
a Board of Directors, composed of
local residents. Owing to the gen-
erosity of the tenants of the Old
Main Building, office and rehear-
sal space were provided for, on
the mall’s second floor. Aside
from regular dramatic presenta-
tions, Brock Johnson (Executive
Director of the Theater) and Suz-
anne McNeese are offering classes
in acting and in dance, respective-
ly. Other workshops will be creat-
ed as time goes on; for informa-
tion regarding the present classes,
call the theater office at 463-4666.

The theater made its formal de-
but during this past summer, with
a production of the musical, | Dol
| Dol, starring Rob Mish and Penni
Chappell, both noted for their per-
formances in last season's pre-
sentation of 1776, The show was a
great popular success, and ran for
several performances, proving
that an “expensive” show can be
staged with a less than mammoth
budget. This play was staged in
the rear show room of College Inn,
but later shows were planned for
various other locations.

This brings us to the second
show, presently in production,
called An Evening of James Thur-
ber, directed by Alex Bourdrez. (It
will be followed by a dinner theat-
er production of The Fantasticks,
with open auditions in January).
Thurber is another example of
how an ingenious show can result
from a shoestring budget. If enter-
tainment value is drama to you,
this show is a must. The set,
though simple, is effective, the
music by June Morgan is bright
and snappy, and certain sketches
("The Macbeth Murder Mystery”
and “A Friend to Alexander” are
the winners hands-down) make for

hardly a dull moment in the en-
tire evening. The only complaints
from this corner are first, that it
ended all too soon; and second,
the fact that some relatively un-
known sketches were chosen, and

one was left to wonder whatever
happened to Walter Mitty and the
neglected majority of fine Thur-
ber comic creations. But, how can
you really take on the work of a
comic genius in under two hours,
and satisfy all the fierceaffi ciona-
dos of his work? All things con-
sidered, Thurber works extremely
well within its confines. This was
especially due to some isolated
bits of wonderful comedy: Suz-
anne Dieckman and Brock John-
son as the addict to murder-mys-
tery novels and her unfortunate
companion; Phyllis Davis and the
quintessential dumb blonde on a
TV show; Craig Strachan as Thur-
ber telling the story of “The Night
the Bed Fell”; and Hunt Brown
and John Ellis as insane men in

two sketches—one with and one
without an ulterior motive.
Perhaps the most characteristic
remark upon leaving a perform-
ance of Thurber is, “How cute.”
Indeed it is. It is also remarkably
fresh and the pacing is consistent.
One other note: The play runs
through Saturday night, in the
basement of the Old Main Build-
ing, every night at 8 P.M. Reser-
vations are usually necessary,
though some seats may be avail-
able at the door. With exams rap-
idly approaching, this unpretenti-
ous pastiche of sketches is a great
idea for relaxation; a play in
which the only points to be proven
are that man is humane, animals
are amusing, and God is not a
Puerto Rican bath attendant.

Journalism films
draw few viewers

by M. GRAY COLEMAN

Tuesday night, November 30,
was an ordinary night in Lexing-
ton. The Lyric Theatre was cur-
rently featuring the movie Car
Wash, which more than one crit-
ti. has aceused of plumbing new
depths in the ocean of movie com-
edy. Its price per seat: $2.00. Its
audience: very large, with a high
proportion of W&L students.
Meanwhile, in another part of
town, Reid Hall was featuring
Citizen Kane, widely considered
not only the greatest movie ever
made, but one of the most amus-
ing and entertaining. Its price per
seat: nothing. Its audience: under
50 students at the two shows com-
bined...

Outrageous, you might say (or
maybe not, if your father owns
ctock in the studio that put out
Car Wash—lI can think of no other
point of defense). Yet, there is a
possible answer to this puzzle,
aside from the easy-out of saying
that W&L has always been a
happy haven for mischievous mon-
coloids. Journalism department
movies in Reid Hall receive practi-
cally no publicity at all—aside
from insertion on the Master Film
List for each term that is prompt-
ly ripped down in the first week,
and in the Weekly Calendar. This
is why you hay have missed Bus-
ter Keaton in The General, John
Wayne and ‘a cast of thousands’
in Stagecoach, or the inimitable
Orson Welles and his Mercury
Players in Citizen Kane, all of
which sneaked quietly in and out
fo Reid Hall 203, even if you had
wanted to see them.

The SAB movies in DuPont Hall
are a different story. praise be!
They do receive adequate public-
ity, and they are shown on more
than one evening. They also cost a
dollar, but this becomes rather
small in the face of the great
movies the SAB Film Subcommit

tee has rounded up for next term.
which include: Showboat (Jan. 12)
Young Frankstein (Jan. 14-16),
Taxi Driver (Feb. 4-6), Brigadoon
(Feb. 18-20), A Man Called Horse
(March 4-6), Psycho (March 18-20),
and Flight of the Phoenix (March
23). True to tradition, the SAB
usually presents big box-office at-
tractions of recent years. But, if
you're more interested in a film
that remains immortal for two or
three generations, Reid Hall is the
answer—that is, if you can find
out what’s playing there. So, the
next time you're keyed up for a
movie, check the campus movies,
too. Is there really anything that
the Marx Brothers can learn from
Richard Pryor?

Stanzel hopes that their influence
will last at Chi Psi. “If I didn’t, I
wouldn’t be doing it,’ he said.
They have achieved a “fair
amount of progress” so far in or-
ganizing the fraternity and will
focus on gaining members from
the freshman and _ sophomore
classes.

Chi Psi is ‘‘elite” in the fact that
it has only 28 chapters nationally,
Stanzel said. (By comparison, TKE
has over 300 chapters), The W&L
chapter would be No. 29—provid-
ed that the co-founders can come
up with a house, some initiates
and some pledges in the remaind-
er of the year. If these goals are
met, Chi Psi intends to participate
in full scale Rush next year. IFC
recognition will also be necessary,
and the co-founders are hopeful
that Chi Psi will be admitted.

Carter Greer, the current secre-
tary of Kappa Alpha, said that Chi
Psi’s success will depend to a
large degree on next year’s Rush
and the reaction of the student
body. A major force in KA’s come-
back, Greer has gone through the
same situation that the Chi Psi co-
founders are now experiencing.
He said that national affiliation
would help Chi Psi, but added that
Kappa Alpha might have had an
advantage with nine founders
compared with Chi Psi’s four).
KA, after its second year of Rush,
has over 30 members according to
IFC president Alfred Robinson. -

If Chi Psi is able to grow as
quickly as KA, it will be doing
well. And there doesn’t seem to be
any reason why it shouldn’t equal
KA’s success. The co-founders
realized that establishing a new
fraternity would be hard work
but, as Stanzel put it, “It’s a pio-
neering thing to do.”

Chi Psi has traditionally been
an Eastern fraternity (Yale, Cor-
nell), but it also has chapters in
the South (North Carolina, Duke)
and the West (Berkeley, Stanford).
One of the older fraternities, it
was founded in 1841 at Ann Ar-
bor, where the national headquar-
ters are located today. It lists 16,-
000 brothers (15,000 graduates
and 1,000 undergraduates) from
28 chapters. In looking at educa-
tional institutions for new chap-
ters, Chi Psi national considers
the student body as well as the
school’s academic standards, en-
dowment, faculty and alumni ac-
tivity.

Strong performance from the bench helped the Generals to victory over the Lynchburg Hornets last
Thursday. Here, Ardith Collins goes up for two of his eleven points.

Basketball team Swimmers defeat UR

still undefeated

by REID SLAUGHTER

The W&L basketball Generals
kept their undefeated record in-
tact by stopping the Lynchburg
College Hornets 91-87 last Thurs-
day in Doremus Gymnasium.

Although the lead exchanged
hands several times, the Generals
were in control for the better part
of the game. The scoring attack
was led by junior Pat Dennis who
hit an amazing 71% from the floor
while getting 22 points. Co-cap-
tain Bob Flint was close behind
with 19 points, and Ardith Col-
lins and Dave Luenig getting 11
and 10 points, respectively.

One of the bright spots for W&L
was the strong play off the bench.
Coach Verne Canfield freely sub-
stituted throughout the game, and
found he was rarely at less than
full strength, with excellent back-
up playing coming from Ardith
Collins, Bruce Williams and Chris
Larson.

Although they found relatively
equal success with both their fast
break and pattern offenses, the
Generals encountered some diffi-
culties with turnovers, fumbling
the ball away 19 times.

With a 3-0 season record and a
1-0 mark in Old Dominion Athletic
Conference play, the team travels
to Emory and Henry Saturday, re-
turning home against Hampden.
Sydney next Wednesday at 8:00
p.m.

Head coach Bill Stearns called
it, “The greatest victory in my ten
seasons at Washington and Lee.”
And that could be the understate-
ment of the young season. The
final score last Saturday in W&L’s
Doremus Pool: W&L 57, Univer-
sity of Richmond 56.

Being one of five Division I op-
ponents who W&L will swim this
season, the U. of R. was expected
to take charge in the meet against
the Generals. But that wasn’t to
be the case, as W&L’s 400 free-
style relay team of Scott Duff,
John Hudson, Robert Newcomb,
and Tad Van Leer edged out the
Spider’s entry by a fraction of a
second to clinch the 57-56 victory.
The meet went down to the final
event, and matched strength
against strength, but this time
anyway, Washington and Lee
proved just a bit stronger.

't appears that again this sea-
son, the W&L swimming Generals
will be a college division national
power. Four of the W&L team
members are returning All-Ameri-
cans, and six swimmers have al-
ready qualified for the nationals.

The 400 free relay team qualifi-
ed with its’ time of 3:18.9 against
Richmond, as did Keith Romich in
the 20 free style, finishing in
1:47.4. Romich set a school record
in the 200 butterfly with a time
of 2:05.1. John Hudson was also a
double winner against the Spiders
winning the 500 and 1000 free-
style, as well as being a member of
the winning relay.

The victory over the U. of R.
was a team effort from start to
finish. Chip Hoke finished second
in the 100 free and 200 1. M., and
anchored the final relay, Pete
Meem won the 200 breaststroke,
Drew Pillsbury was second in the
200 backstroke, Gordon Ross took
second in the 3 meter diving and
third in the 1 meter diving, and
Scott Duff won the 50 free and
took third in the 100 free, as well
as leading off the final relay.

Three wrestlers place

by KEVIN McFADDEN

Three wrestlers from W&L plac-
ed in the first annual Washington
and Lee Invitational Tournament.

For W&L at 158 Ibs., senior cap-
tain, Jim Crytzer, won three
matches on his way to W&L’s only
first place showing.

Crytzer pinned his first man
from Liberty Baptist; decisioned
his second match against a Key-
det, 40; and superior decisioned
the third in the 18-7 finale with a
matman from York.

For his efforts, Crytzer was vot-
ed the tournament’s Most Valu-
able Wrestler.

Sophomore Ed Rogers was the
only wrestler from W&L to make
it to the finals, winning matches
against York and Maryville. He
was defeated in the finals in a
close 42 match against a George
Mason wrestler.

The only other W&L wrestler to
place was freshman Ray Gross,
placing third.

Liberty Baptist won the tourna-
ment capturing 6314 points. Fol-
lowing L.B.C. were: York, 61;
VM!, 60 3/4; Maryville, 41%;
W&L, 31: Howard, 29%; Madison,
28; and George Mason, 20%.

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

Football: a winning season

J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals completed the 1976 season
with a 5-5 record, the best record
a Generals’ football team has man-
aged since 1967. The Generals in
finishing 4th in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference (Randolph-
Macon was Ist) placed 4 players
on the Ist team all-conference,
and 7 men on the 2nd team.

The whole of W&L should be
proud of its 1976 football team.
These young men worked hard to
obtain their 5-5 mark, and they
deserve to hold their heads high.
On the road to this fine season, 11
players gained distinction for
themselves in the ODAC,

Tony Perry, who holds all pass
receiving records at W&L, was
named ODAC Player of The Year.
Steve DiBiagio was a unanimous
choice at offensive guard. Jack
Reeves ended his four year career
with a first team selection at de-
fensive tackle. Jack Norberg, who
led the conference in intercep-
tions, was W&L’s fourth pick on
the first team.

The Generals placed on the sec-
ond team: end Rick Fink, line-
backers Jeff Slatcoff and Carl Fol-
cik, and defensive backs Don
Crossly and Mark Healy. From the
offense, Ray Scott and center
Mark Duncan were chosen. This
was quite an honor for Duncan,
who bounced back this season
from a couple of knee operations
he had last year.

Though we finished with a good
year, winning 4 out of the last 5
games, we still have many areas
that need improvement. W&L’s op-
ponents beat us statistically in
every category-total offense, total
defense, etc... . W&L did finish
2nd in passing offense and rush-
ing defense in the ODAC, but 4th
(out of 5 teams) in rushing offense
and passing defense.

Mary’s College.

No away events.

The offensive line, lacking size
and experience, could not grind
out yardage on the ground. The
offense relied mainly on quarter-
back Ted Hissey’s arm to obtain
the necessary yardage. The Gen-
erals best game offensively was
against Bridgewater.

The defensive backfield (main-
ly through inexperience and poor
positioning) allowed opposing
teams’ quarterbacks to throw suc-
cessfully on them game after
game. Though never achieving
preseason expectations, the defen-
sive backfield did show consistent
improvement from game to game.

The defensive line held the de-
fense together as opposing teams
found it hard to gain ground yard-
age on W&L’s small but quick line
and powerful linebackers. The de-
fense’s best game was probably in
the 7-3 upset against conference
champion, Randolph-Macon.

Hissey finished the season as the
ODAC’s leading quarterback. Af-
ter a slow start, he showed mark-
ed improvement throughout the
season. Though performing ade-
quately for the Generals, he com-
pleted les than 50% of his passes
and led the ODAC in interceptions
(14). If he can improve in these
two areas, and build more confi-
dence in his play calling, the Gen-

erals should have a fine quarter-
back for next season.

Hissey had as his two main re-
ceivers, Rich Wiles and Tony
Perry. Wiles led the team in total
receptions and displayed sure
hands throughout the entire year.
Perry, on the other hand, seemed
to drop more passes than he
caught. Opposing teams were cov-
ering him more effectively than
in the past, and consequently,
Perry’s receptions suffered. He
did gain form late in the season
though, and finished one recep-
tion behind Wiles.

Ray Scott showed much dm-
provement over his first two sea-
sons as he led the Generals in
rushing. The appearance of fresh-
man running back, Stew Atkinson
was an added spark to W&L’s run-
ning attack. If the offensive line
becomes stronger and quicker for
next season, and if Buck Leslie
utilizes Atkinson’s straight ahead
toughness, and Scott’s outside
quickness—then W&L could have
two backs averaging over 4 yards
per carry, which is what they need
to have a successful running at-
tack.

The team was plagued with
many injuries, which undoubtedly
hurt them considerably. Offensive

(Continued from page 1)

Robinson said he had consulted
Dean Lewis G. John on the matter
and that John advised against
looking into it.

At Robinson’s request, the E. C.
voted 6-5 with Sandy Stradtman
abstaining not to record the dis-
cussion in the official minutes of

Kelly later said ‘“‘We're going to
pretend it (the discussion) never

Earlier, the E.C. had voted to
uphold a fine imposed by the Cold

then he thought the University
had no business prying into a stu-
dent’s checkbook, as it was the

Irwin was a member of the vol-
unteer ambulance unit which
served in France from 1917 to

1919. The letters included in the
newly published volume were
written to his parents, Mr. and
Mrs. W. P. Irwin of Lexington, and
to his brothers and sisters. They

des-ribe his first days of training .

in Pennsvivania, his trip to Eur-
ope on a troop ship, a stopover in
southern England, and his combat
experiences on the battlefields of
France.

Many of the letters were, writ-
ten amidst gun and cannon fire,
aecording to Dr. Turner, and pre-
sent vivid pictures both of life in
the battle zones and of the char-
acter of his fellow ambulance-unit
volunteers, mostly W&L students
like Irwin himself.

Dr. Turner’s previous three
books in the current series are 7h
Medic Forty-Niner,” the letters of
Dr. Reuben Knox; “An Old Field
Schoolteacher,” the diary of Jere-
miah C. Harris; and the diaries
and letters of Capt. Greenlee
Davidson during the Civil War.

WA&L gets new painting

A new painting by the noted
American artist Ray Prohaska has
been added to the permanent col-
lection of W&L where he taught
for six years.

Prohaska painted the work es-
pecially for W&L, and put the fin-
ishing touches on the canvas in
the room in which it now hangs—
the Fairfax Lounge of W&L’s
Early-Fielding Student Center.
The abstract painting was com-
missioned for W&L by a group of
Prohaska’s friends and former
students.

A past president of the Ameri-
can Society of Illustrators, Pro-
haska was artist-in-residence at
W&L from 1963 to 1969. After
leaving W&L, he went to Wake
Forest University, where he held
a similar post in the art depart-
ment headed by Dr. Sterling M.
Boyd, also a former W&L art pro-
fessor.

Prohaska is a naturalized
American citizen who was born in
Yugoslavia. He studied at the Cal-
ifornia Schoo! of Fine Arts in San
Francisco. His paintings have
shown in the National Academy,
the Pennsylvania Academy, the
Whitney, and other leading Ameri-
can galleries. Prohaska illustra-
tions have appeared in most of the
nation’s leading magazines as
well, including Good Housekeep-
ing, the Saturday Evening Post,
Esquire, Holiday and others.

Prohaska now lives in Bridge-
hampton, N. Y.

Football:
a winning
season

(Continued hom page 3)
guards, Sal Abbruzzese and Bob
Williams, were out most of the
season, along with tight end, Bob
S-ezecinski; running back, Keith
Steele; punter, Phil Bailey; and
probably the most costly, place-
ki ker, Dan Thompson. Thompson,
with a painful pulled hamstring
musele, was unable to regain the
powerful kick in his leg until late
in the season. That, along with the
Generals lack of backup kicker,
and the coaches’ unwillingness to
develop one, considerably hurt
W&L’s field goal attack.

Though the Generals were not a
blue chip statistical team, they did
what past teams in recent years
‘ouldn’t do—win games. The main
cifferenee between this team and
past teams was the amount of
umty and team spirit that existed
on this team. Each member was
willing to sacrifice his social life
and devote himse!f entirely to the
p-ogram—and it ‘paid off.

élrat the team did lack, how-
evov, Was tne suport of its stu-
den, body. No other student bedy
in the country will sit sullen in
the stands when their team is in-
side the opponent’s 10 yard line,
except for Washingion and Lee’s.
A “charge” or a couple of rah rahs
can sometimes push a team over
ihe gual line.

Having the Homecoming Dance
after the game instead of before
the game so the football players
could attend, wouldn’t hurt. A Sat-
urday afternoon is not only a
good time to get totally wasted,
but is also an excellent time to
exhibit some of the school spirit
that was supposed to have been
instilled in us way back at the
time of Natural Bridge.

The 1976 team was a young
team, and is graduating only sev-
en seniors. If the enthusiasm that
was evident in this year’s team,
carries over to next year’s team;
added to the experience gained
from this season, the Generals
should have a big year. Next year,
let’s heip them win games.

Biden is the first speaker in the

—— ret "77 series.
a ter pollster Pat Caddell was

Lexington

\n exhibition of important ex-
amples of American sculpture
from public collection in Lexing-
ton is taking place in duPont Gal-
lery this month.

The exhibition opened last
Tuesday and will continue through
Jan, 24.

In all.©19 pieces ranging from
miniature cameos to larger-than
life statues will be represented in
the display. Most of the pieces
depict the pre-eminent historical
figures associated with Lexington
Gens. George Washington, Robert
I. Lee and Thomas J. (Stonewall)
Jackson, and almost all the
sculptures are owned by Wash-
ington and Lee or Virginia Mili-
tary Institute.

The exhibition is the result of
a year-long research project by
Dr. Pamela Simpson, assistant pro
fessor of art at W&L, and nine
of her art students. This is the
second exhibition of its type Dr.
Simpson and her students have
organized, Last winter, her W&L

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA,

George Waihsngton, by John Crookshank King, 1862
This cameo is typical of King’s work in its meticulous neo-classic-
alism, and in design probably derives from the famous sculpture
of Washington by Jean Antoine Houdon (also represented in the
Lexington sculpture exhibition).

man year at St. Christopher’s
school in Riehmond. The town of
Mineral was replacing its obso-

him have the city limits sign in
order to prove a point to his
classmates.

He said his fellow students
joked with him about being from
a town so small the road signs
said “Entering Mineral’ on one
side and “Leaving Mineral” on the
other. He got the sign to prove
his colleagues thet it was one-
sided,

Dickinson has a letter from th?
town of Mineral saying he got the
‘ign legitimately. But he said he
refrained from teiling the police
that it was legal until he could
find out how they found his sign
and whether they used improper
methods.

He said he has since found out
that the dog warden reported see
ing some other signs, for which
Diekinson gives his room-mates
credit, when he came to take care
of some stray dogs in the area
during the Christmas break.

The police came to check on
the signs and found the door ajar.
Dickinson said, and went inside
to investigate. Dickinson said the

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

Thursday, January 13, 1977

Parking

Many W&L students have cars, and many live some con-

siderable distance from campus. This much is clear.

What is unclear is where these students are to park their
cars when they manage to roll in for class. On-campus park-

ing is physically restricted to a limited area which must be
shared by faculty, students, and staff. Much of this area is
officially off-limits to most student vehicles, and the close
vigilance of the University Proctor and his staff usually keep
it that way, unless one can afford Murph’s “fees” on a
recular basis.

So the forlorn commuter is foreed to park his car on the
streets of Lexington. This wouldn't be so bad if only it were
possible. Two-hour limits on virtually all available space mean
that students parked on, say, Lee Avenue between Sigma
Chi P.O, must either back and forth
campus every two hours and hope to find another place down

and the dash from
the street, erase the chalk marks on the tires (check both front
and rear, these fellows are cunning), or resign themselves
once more to paying the city of Lexington for use of space
which nobody else uses anyway.

All this amounts to another chapter in the continuing rip-
off of W&L students by the City of Lexington, How long will
we be forced to pay tribute to these people? It has been
suggested that a petition be circulated among students urging
the removal of unnecessary parking restrictions on the streets
surrounding the University. \s a legitimate means of fighting
City Hall, it’s worth a try. We can always get violent later on,

—RDL

Inertia

Reports from the last faculty meeting indicate that this
august body in continuing its policy of ignoring student needs
through inaction, in keeping with the infamous Winter Break

non-deeision,

The debate centered around the grading system currently
in use at W&L, The four-point system is archaic, arbitrary,
and inadequate as regards effective evaluation of student per

formance, An expanded system including plus and minus

notations, long favored by many faculty members, was pro-
posed and voted down. As no alternative could be agreed
upon, the discussion was tabled.

Cpinions on the subject are, of course, widely divergent,
Many professors seem comfortable with the current system.
It is extremely simple, requiring little effort or evaluation on
the part of the teacher, and it is widely recognized by graduaie
schools and businesses as a determining factor in a student’
overall record. But none of this means that the four-potat

system is any good, only that it is easier to leave it alone than

to try to change it.

One professor's ideal is a system of written remarks with
out any specific notational system. This would require care/ul

and extended thought on the teacher's part. Too much to

ask, | think, of people whose apparent main interest is in
doing as little as possible; an ideal it will remain,

By M. GRAY COLEMAN
Entertainment Editor

It takes nothing more than a
cursory glance at a W&L cata-
logue of around ten years ago to
see the recent blossoming that
the field of art has experienced.
Just what was being offered
around the mid-1960’s? That was
only a smattering of courses in

art, drama, and music, loosely
organized under the banner of
Fine Arts, and nothing more. The
Troubadour Theatre lacked not
only a workshop for set design,
but such necessities as dressing
and make-up facilities. People say
it was not uncommon to see actors
sitting on the steps, running down
the outside of the small building,
waiting for their cue to go on-
stage! Though the “trooper spirit”
of these people can be appreci-
ated, it can hardly be imagined
today.

Indeed, the arts have come a

very long way in the past decade.
But, they have hardly reached
the end which will bring them
on an equal footing with many
other academie departments. The
music department is split between
the glamorous basement of the
Student Center and a tottering
McCormick Library; The visual
arts are also divided between a
few axeas in duPont Hall and
Howe Annex (a building that
half the student body isn’t even
aware of); and the thespians carry
on valiantly in a_ reconverted,
barnlike building, and a laundry
boiler room. It must be admitted
that the arts here are not living
“the good life.” Not yet. But,
slowly, surely, they are getting
there. It is the purpose of the
Ring-tum Phi, in the next three
weeks, to take an in-depth look
at each of the fine art depart-
ments, assess their progress,
illustrate their needs, and specu-
late about their futures.

Today, the Department of Fine
Arts is made up of three quasi-
autonomous divisions, each offer-
ing its own major in the catalogue.
Division heads are Leonel Kahn
(drama), Gerard Doyon (art), and
Robert Stewart (music). Serving
as administrative head of the en-
tire department is Dr, Albert C.
Gordon, who came to W&L in
1974 from the University of
Toledo. Dr. Gordon’s entrance
into the faculty is but one ex-
ample of the growth of the arts
as regards staff, which has more
than doubled in the past ten years.

“There is a master plan for
development in this area,” he
commented. “The final goal is to
bring all the music and visual arts
under one roof in duPont Hall,
and move all the unrelated de-
partments into other facilities. As
a matter of fact, the original
grant establishing duPont design-
ated it for the arts. We hope
to exand the studios and gallery

that’s it. My responsibility would
be to negotiate the terms of the
contra‘t. make sure it fits in
with the seheduling we have, and
coordinate with all the other de-
partments to let them know what's
going on so they can make their
services available to the promoter.
Another ease is where we go
out and copromote an event with
somebody. An example is the Ice
Capades. instead of getting stand-
ard rent, it’s like a 50-50 deal.
The third way is where we go out
and ereate our own events. For
example, we have what we call
the Washington Internationa!
World of Plants coming up in
March where we are putting on
a show on our own. This is a
eeneral type of job because every
event is different.

Rip: What do you look for in
an act to determine if it will be
successful here?

Darr: Generally, how well they
have done in other parts of the
country. First, | find out how well
an act has done in other parts of
the country, and why it has done
well. For example, there is a
Canadian skating star's ice show
which sells out everywhere it
goes in Canada, but it wouldn't

sell ten tickets in this market.
So, even if a show does well in
certain areas, it wouldn't neces-
sarily do well here, so that’s why
you have to look into it a little
bit more. Another indicator is
trade publications like Billboard
and Variety. You read those re-
ligiously.

Rtp: What indicators do you go
by to determine if an act will
succeed with the Washington area
audience?

Darr: Washington has certain
traits about it. It is a fairly so-
phistieated market. It doesn’t go
in big for country shows or religi-
oits type things like “Jesus Christ
Superstar.” This is a good place
to bring things like the Soviet
cireus. In basketball and hockey,
big draws are when New York
and Boston play here, because
there are a lot of people from
those areas living here. In gen-
eral, you gure that you’re dealing
with an upper-middle class mix of
people from all over the country,
and they’re pretty sophisticated,
so that’s the target area we aim
for.

Rtp: How do you know what
acts are available?

Darr: Generally, when a tour
is put together, they'll contact the
ten or fifteen largest arenas in
the country. They contact us to
say that they’re available and if
we would consider playing their
chow. They need us as much as
we need them. They need to play
Washington. It’s the sixth largest
metropolitan area in the United
States, with the highest per capita
income in the United States.
Another souree of who's touring
are the trade papers.

Rtp: How do most groups want
to be paid, a set guaranteed fee
or a percentage of the receipts?

Darr: Generally they want both.
There are acts you can buy very
cheaply and there are acts that

know they’re going to sell out
and you know they're going to sell
out, and they tell you what you
are going to pay them. But, in
most of the cases of the acts who
are going to come close to selling
out, they want a minimum guaran-
tee. A typical example would be
something like $25,000 guaranteed
to the act plus about 60% of
everything over $70,000. That’s a
typical rock act type of arrange-
ment today. Somebody like Led
Zeppelin or Elvis Presley, in some
cases come in and tell you how
much rent they’re going to pay,

‘and you can take it or leave it.

Every act is individual and has
to be dealt with differently. Out-
side of the rock world, things are
pretty reasonable. A typical dea!
with a non-rock act is a 50-50 deal.
You take advertising off the top
and split the money 50-50. That
way you're both partners in the
show with art equal stake.

Rtp: Being an agent for the
Centre, do you just deal with
other agents, or are there any
acts which make their own deals
without an agent?

Darr: I can't think of anytime
we've ever dealt directly with the
entertainer himself. They don’t
have the time, and they almost
need a fall guy, teo. It’s like the
act wants to retain their image
of being “Mr. Nice Guy” by just
being artist, and the agent being
the “Bad Guy” and making the
money deals.

Rtp: Hiow far in advance do you
book an act?

Darr: Typieally six months te
twelve months. What we generally
do is block out the large type
shows like the Ice Capades and
the circus. We put them as far
apart as possible and fill in with
the small stuff as we go along.
We book things up until the day
before. I booked an event one
night and we had the event the
next day. Musie acts are booked,
maybe at the most, two months
in advance,

Fine Arts program at W&L
still small, but growing

on the ground floor, move the
music professors into the second
floor, and use the entire third
flood as a large rehearsal hall.
An art library, on a par with
other departmental collections
like journalism or the sciences,
is aiso being discussed.” Evi-
dently, there would have been
no objection to beginning these
plans this year, but for the be-
ginning of the new library as a
more urgent concern. The dis-
placement of a large number of
faculty members and the begin-
ning of renovation on Tucker Hall
left very little surplus moving
room for such a project. But, it
is definitely on schedule to begin
once these inconveniences are
passed.

Another heaithy sign is the
rapid creation of new courses.
“We realized the need for basic
introductory courses in drama and
art, on a par with the already-
existing Musie 151. The admini-
stration cooperated fully with us
on this idea, and as a result, we
are offering Art 100 and Drama
139.” said Gordon. Another new
course is Drama 140, a styles-
oriented offering that will include
a tutorial session of several weeks
with the Warsaw mime group that
appeared on campus earlier this
year. It will deal with voice,
dition is Musie 100. a one-credit
eourse to be offered fall and
winter terms, beginning next
year. It wil Ideal with coice,
ennunciation, and projection for
actors and singers; and will be
taught by Gordon Spice.

Dr. Gordon and his colleagues
feel that the small size of the
department may lead to some set-
backs, but there are definite good
points to be mentioned. Their
philosophy of fine arts to retain
the small size, making it easier
to increase quality, while opening
the department to all who are
interested. One final idea on the
drawing-board at this time is a
fourth type of major—a major in
Fine Arts as a whole. The student
will take courses in ali three
divisions, in order to see the na-
tural union of the three branches.
Generally, this would be a fine
arts version of a Commerce major
in Newcomb Hall. as opposed to
straight accounting or economics.

Many different people, from the
most hard-core drama major to
the individual who has never seen
duPont Art Gallery, bemoan that
the fine arts are not developed
to the degree they should be. In
all fairness. this is true. The
building and laboratory facilities
of the fine arts (whether it be
stage facilities, musie listening
rooms, or callery space) should be
on an equal level with any other
department on campus. W&L may
not be a professional preparatory
art school, but it is also not a
professional business college—at
least officially. This is truly a
liberal arts university, and each
department within it should be
well developed toe provide the
necessary balance. Looking at the
record of the past ten years. it
seems safe to say that the uni-
versity administration is working
for, and sveceeding so far, in just
that goal.

Generals clean up at tournament

By JERRY HARRIS

“General Hoop-la”, the official
basketball program of the Gen-
erals basketball team, predicted
that the eighth annual Washing-
ton and Lee Invitational tourna-
ment “should make for two eve-
nings of edge-of-your-seat excite-
ment.”

That prediction turned out to be
only half right, however, as only
the final night of basketball action
proved to be exciting. The Gen-
erals overcame a stingy man-to-
man defense and a halftime deficit
to take the championship trophy
from Grove City, 60-57, while
Ifaverford College slipped by the
University of North Carolina at
Greensboro Spartans, 80-76, in the
consolation game. Grove City ad-
vanced to the finals by hammer-
ing Haverford 90-73 and: W&L
easily outlasted UNCG 86-70 in
the second game on Friday night.

The Generals had little dif-
ficulty with the Greensboro Spart-
ans in the second half of their
semi-final tilt but the reverse was
the case in the first half. Led
by the inside shooting of Bob
lint and some hot outside shoot-
ing, W&L overcame a tall UNCG
lineup to chalk up a four-point
lead with less than five minutes to
go in the first half. Less than a
minute later, however, the Spart-
ans had taken a 37-32 lead with
the help of a three-point play and
two technical foul shots.

But W&L came right back to
knot the score up and take a
three-point half-time lead. At that

point it appeared that the Gen-
erals and UNCG were going to
battie it out right up to the buzzer.
The Spartans were penetrating
the W&L zone with some ease
and held a slight edge in re-
bounds. Menwhile, the Generals
were missing their assignments on
defense and only Bob Flint was
having a good offensive game. But
such was not the case.

Showing their best defensive
performance of the year, W&L
came out in the second half to
completely dominate the Spartans.
An aggressive man-to-man de-
fense combined with some timely
rebounding by Don Berlin held
UNCG to only one shot for much
of the second half. Meanwhile,
Berlin, Flint, Pat Dennis and
Chris Larson were shooting holes
in the Spartans’ defense.

The turning point of the contest
came mid-way through the last
half when Generals head coach
Verne Canfield inserted the line-
up of Larson, Flint, Kim Sims,
Bruce Williams and Ardith Col-
lins. That contingent completely
manhandled the Spartans on de-
fense while stretching. a six-point
lead into a 14-point margin.

UNCG pulled to within eight
points near the end of the game
on the strength of a desperate
full-eourt press. But some clutch
foul shooting by Larson, Flint, and
Dennis put the game safely out
of reach. W&L placed five men in
double figures. Berlin and Dennis
both put in 16 points while Dave
Leuning and Larson scored 12

markers. Flint led the Generals
offense with 18 points and 12 re-
bounds. :

In the championship contest,
the Generals faced an opponent
that was ironically very much
similar to their own style of play.
Grove City depended on a tenaci-
ous man-to-man defense while
working patiently for the short
jump shot on offense. In addition
to this bothersome similarity of
style, W&L had the additional
problem a Grove City lineup that
included two six-foot four-inch
guards.

The problems did not phase the
Generals in the opening moments,
however, as a fired up contingent
jumped on the visiting Wolverine
for a quick 6-0 lead. But W&L
went cold on offense just as
quickly as they had turned hot.
Grove City took advantage of that
suden cold streak to pick apart
the General zone defense and tie
the score up at eight apiece. The
two teams traded baskets until
the half with Grove City holding
the edge at 32-30.

The second half started off with
a bang for the Wolevrines, run-
ning off eight straight points to
take a 40-34 edge. Washington and
Lee caught up on some patient
offensive patterns but Grove City
appeared to be holding on. The
Generals caught fire when a
couple of questionable calls went
against them and Larson, Dennis
and Don Berlin led W&L to a 48-
44 lead.

Grove City pulled back in front
with four minutes to play but
that was to be their last gasp.
Berlin began to take control of
the boards, pulling down almost

Swimmers take

first loss

After victories over Madison
and Richmond, Coach Bill Stearn’s
mermen suffered their first set-
back of the season Saturday, 65-
48 loss to strong Virginia Tech.
It was a close meet throughout,
but the Gobbler’s depth proved
too difficult to overcome.

W&L winners included John
Hudson in the 1000 freestyle,
Chip Hoke in the 500 freestyle,
Pete Meem in the 200 breastroke,
and the 400 freestyle relay team
of Hudson, Tad LanLeer, Keith
Romich, and Scott Duff. That relay
team is the top-rated NCAA Di-
vision Ill team in the country.

Hoke also took second place in
the 1000 free and 200 individual
medley, while VanLeer took sec-
ond in the 50 and 100 free. Keith
Romich was second place finisher
in the 200 free and 200 butterfly,
and Drew Pillsbury took second in
the 200 backstroke.

The swimming Generals are in
ation again on Saturday at
George Washington University,
with a home tri-meet the follow-
ing Friday against cross-town
rival V.M.1. and Towson State.

Perry named All-American

The football Generals’ eo-cap-
tain Tony Perry was recently
named to the first team Division
lll Coaches’ All-American team,
and also to the Mutual Black Net-
work’s All-American team.

Perry is W&L’s all-time leading
pass receiver with 154 passes for
2122 vards and 16 touchdowns.
He is also the first player in
W&L history to be named as a
first team All-American selection.
Players have received an honor-
able mention in the past. however.

When asked about the award.
Perry said that he was most
happy to receive it and that dur-
ing his career he considered it
“the highest individual goal I had
hoped to atiain.” He was chosen
as an honorable mention as a
sophomore.

Perry said he was proud of his
Coaches’ selection becatise many
coaches around the nation recog-
nized him for what he is—a

a special type of pride for the

tion as an outstanding player.

elaboration, he said the team was
better prepared, both mentally
and physically; the coaches pre-
pared the team sooner; and in

practive, they actually played
football somewhat different
from the past. All in all, a

stronger program was put into
practice.

Though pleased with the honor,
Perry was not too pleased with
the role he played this year. The
previous three years he had been
used as a pass-receiving tight end.
This year, his role was changed
to that of a blocking end. There
fore, though the coaches may have
thought he helped the team more
in this eapacity, his statistical
performance wasn't what it had
previously been.

“My role was that of a block-
ing tight end, used primarily as
a decoy. When | did go out for
a pass, | would be doubled cov-
ered, leaving some of my team-
mates uncovered. This definitely
helped the team; I just wish I
had a chance to catch more
passes,”

ed his selection to his coaches
and his teammates, especially co

in receptions with 31, and Farrar
played behind Perry.

Perry, who is a sociology ma-
jor with an Army commitment,
wants very much to play pro
football. “I have to admit, that
is definitely one of my goals.”
Ile says that about every team
has contacted him in one form or
another, but as yet none have
shown a strong interest in him.
Among the teams that have travel-
ed to W&L to talk with him are
San Diego, the Jets, New Eng-
land, and Cineinnati.

Although Perry still has track
season ahead of him. his college
sports career is rapidly coming to
a close. Not only has he proved
himself on the athletic fields of
endeavor, but also in the W&L
community and as a leader in
the KOTC program, His departure
will leave a large gap. not to be

all of his nine grabs in the final
moments of the contest. Berlin
combined his clutch inside shots
with some long range bombs by
Dennis to lead the Generals to a
59-53 margin with 41 seconds to
go. The Wolverines pressed to
eatch up but two foul shots by
Dennis put it away for good. Ber-
lin ended up with 13 markers for
his second solid performance in
two nights. Dennis tallied 15
points to lead the Generals and
Larson chipped in 11 points.

Potentially, this was the strong-
est field ever for the annual
Invitation tournament. But that
potential was hard to see most of
the time. Haverford entered the
weekend play with a perfect 7-0
record, Grove City held a 7-1
mark, W&L was 6-2 and UNCG
was 4-3. The Generals, though,
were clearly the class of the field
showing both a balanced scoring
attack and some tight defense.

Don Berlin and Pat Dennis
made the All-Tournament team
with Berlin capturing the MVP
award. Grove City’s Donahoe, Bil!
Travis of Haverford and Mark
Bullock of UNCG completed the
five man all-star club.

Wrestlers

After about a three week layoff,
the Washington and Lee wrestl-
ing team rolls (or by the time you
read this, rolled) into action
against Eastern Mennonite. Asked
if some of his wrestlers might
not be a little out of shape after
such a layoff, Coach Franke re-
sponded that he did not think so.
“Over Christmas vacation most of
them wrestle at their high schools
and stay in good shape. Actually
we are a little ahead of where
we ought to be right now. Con-
ditioning is pretty much over. It
is simply a matter of improving
our technique.”

With this in mind the Generals
look ahead to the last half of
their season, and with some opti-
mism too. At 3-1 they have a big
win against VMI under their belts
and that much more confidence.
So what does the rest of the
season look like? “I feel we have
a very good chance to win the
league this year. Part of the rea-
son, of course, is that the ODAC
is not as strong as the old VCAA
was. Though we still have to
wrestle strong teams such as
George Mason nad Madison, they
are not in the league.” Perhaps
it is also possible that this year’s
team is slightly stronger than
that of last year owing to another
year’s experdience and some fine
freshmen.

But any analysis of the W&L
wrestling team must start with
captain Jim Crytzer. In the fourth
year of a superior career, Jim is
(8-1) and was named the most
valuable wrestler of the W&L
wrestling tournament. But sta-
tisties are only a small! indication
of his value to the team. Coach
Franke comments. “Jimmy is a
very flexible wrestler who can
wrestle at 158, 167, or 177 de-
pending on the opposition. For
example, against VMI we moved
Jimmy to 167 to wrestle Pearson
and instead of losing three points
we gained six when Jimmy was
able to pin him. That was the dif-
ference in the match.” W&L beat
VMI for the first time ever, 25-23

Another reason for the success
of this year’s team is the emerg-
ence of Ed “Stork” Rodgers (6-3)
as a top wrestler. Only a sopho
more, Ed's suecess stems largely
from his decision to concentrate
on wrestling as his only sport in
college. “Last year Eddie played
football too and, as a result, had
to come out for the team halfway

ATLANTA RHYTHM SECTION

The Atlanta Rhythm Section is
determined to, as they say in the
South, “kick ass.” They're excited
about a fresh start with Polydor,
who believes they've got the
cream of the crop in Southern
rock.

“Third Annual Pipe Dream” is
the name of the Atlanta Rhythm
Section’s first LP for Polydor.
They consider it the best thing
they’ve ever recorded, and their
standards for themselves are
exacting. One critic who had an
advance listen to the album called
it “A milestone in Southern
music... or just plain music.”

The Atlanta Rhythm Section
has been waiting a long time for
recognition. But these proud
Southern men know that they’re
ready now in a way that they
weren't before.

And their fans, who include
Procol Harum, Eric Clapton, Joe
Cocker and many, many others,
would probably agree with them
when they say they feel sure the
“Third Annual Pipe Dream” is
about to become a reality.

Members of the group are: J. R.

MEISBURG AND WALTERS

Everywhere from the prestigi-
ous Exit/In in Nashville to a
small college in Stephenville,
Texas, to a coffee house in Talla-
hassee, to large universities in the
East, Meisburg and Walters have
been playing to packed houses
and standing ovations! Who are
the guys that make up one of
music’s brightest new country-pop
duos? Steve Meisburg and John
Walters have been involved in
music nearly all of their lives.
liaving performed _ separately
throughout their high school and
college careers, they combined
their musical talents in 1974, and
it's been straight up ever since.
The only thing that tops their
songwriting and performing abil-
ity is the rapport with the audi-
ence and excitement generated in
their live performances!

Their first album, “See The
Morning Breaking,” was released
in September, 1975, after two suc-
cessful singles that were released
earlier in the year. Some of the
finest studio musicians in the
country saw the potential of Steve
and John and performed as the

sonal appearance and __ travel

University shuts down

For the first time in over a
decade, the university shut down
its operations because of weather-
related problems Monday.

The last time such a closing oc-
curred was in the 1960s when
classes were cancelled due to
heavy snow.

The problems this time were
caused by cold winds from Canada
coming through the Midwest and
taking up residence in Virginia.

Sunday night the James River
was frozen and Virginia Electric

     

mg

and Power Company (Vepco) had
ice blocking the intakes for its
cooling and condensing systems
at the Chesterfield and Surry gen-
erating plants, according to a
spokesman for the utility.

Vepco began shutting off power
to different areas of the com-
monwealth Monday morning to
compensate for the loss of egiht
generators in the Eastern Virginia
power plants as well as the fa-
cility at Mount Storn in West
Virginia.

The university got word Mon-
day morning that its turn to lose
power would come from 12:30 to
2:30 in the afternoon.

Vepco had solved enough of its
problems to continue service by
that time but most activities at
W&L had already been cancelled.

Work in some offices continued,
but the lights were turned off to
conserve energy.

Electric typewriters were still
in use.

Evans Dining Hall served lunch
using paper utensils and dishes
after turning off their diswashers
in anticipation of the power loss.

Someone was standing in the
quad of the old dorms around
noon instructing freshmen to turn
oil their lights and any non-es-

Loud rock music could still be
heard coming from _ students’

Freshman convicted

for snowball assault
By RICK MAKOU

\ Washington and Lee student
now has a criminal record as the
result of throwing a snowball.

On Jan. 4th, freshman Reid M.
Slaughter was standing on the
corner of Washington Street and
Lee Avenue near the Sigma Chi
house. Slaughter noticed that sev-
eral people were throwing snow-
balls and decided to join in the
fun.

He threw a snowball at a friend,
Cove Geary, who was standing on
the other side of Washington
Street; however, part of the snow-
ball went astray and hit a pass-
ing car.

Lexington Patrolman John K.
Colbert saw the act, stopped
Slaughter, and issued a summons
for’ ‘discharging a guided missile
al a moving vehicle.” Slaughter
protested that the snowball was
not purposely thrown at the car
and that the driver was unaware
that his car had been hit, but
Colbert was unsympathetic.

Disgusted, Slaughter told Col-
bert that this was “small-twon
justice” and that things like this
gave small-town policemen a bad
Leputation

Slaughter appeared in court on

Jan. 11. When he told General
District Court Judge Joseph E.
liess what the charge was, the

jidge chuckled. The judge looked
ip the law and found that throw-
ing a missile into the street was
a misdemeanor

Sl.ughter retold the story and
argucd that being from Texas, he
rarely saw snow and was just
excited. But the judge found
him guilty.

The judge suspended the fine
and stated that the conviction will
stand to “uphold the dignity of
the law” and serve as a warning
for future snowball throwers.

Power

Perhaps there are those who welcome a temporary shut
down of University operations as a way to get out of going
to school and studying. In elementary and high school, such
events were cause for riotous celebration. Rarely if ever did
we stop to consider the reasons behind or the consequences

beyond a school closing.

| spoke with a secretary in Washington Hall who could
remember only one other oceasion on which the University
had been forced to shut down. That was during the Sixties,
due to an excessively heavy snowfall which prevented many
faculty and students from reaching the campus. This time,
Winter was again the ostensible villain, freezing over the
James River and forcing Vepeo to shut off a number of gen
erators and henee causing a dramatic reduction in the amount

of available power.

\ecording to James Arthur, superintendent of building
and grounds, Vepeo informed the University around 7:00 a.m
that power consumption would have to be reduced on Calipus
Hence the semi-darkened Co-op which greeted A-hour dic
Between 10 and 10:30 a.m., Vepeo told the University
that all power would be cut off from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m., and
\rthur consulted with the University Treasurer James Whit
President Robert FE. R. Huntley, who made the

head and

Twenty-four years ago Wash-
ington and Lee University hired
its first professor whose time was
devoted exclusively to teaching
music appreciation courses. His
first semester he taught a total
of fifteen students.

That professor was Robert
Stewart, current head of the
music division of the Fine Arts

Department. This past fall threre
were nearly 200 students enrolled
in music courses. Music instruc-
tion on this campus has made
significant progress, but there is
still plenty of room for improve-
ment.

When he arrived in Lexington

in September 1955 Professor
Stewart joined three Fine Art
instructors. Prior to that time
Professor Stephenson (German

Dept.) taught one course in music
appreciation. There was a glee
club and an ROTC band of 60
members (the ROTC corps was
800 men strong in those days).

Within several years Stewart
had added composition and theory
courses, and had helped organize
a brass choir as well as small
instrumental ensembles. Classes
in the history of Classical and
Romantic music were worked into
the curriculum.

James Cook was added to the
faculty in the autumn of 1968,
when he was hired as a temporary
replacement for Stewart, who was
on sabbatical. Cook made such a
hit with the students that he was
permanently hired (besides, the
work load was heavy enough to
warrant two full time professors)
More courses were added, in
struction in violin, and piano was
begun.

Gordon Spice came to Lexing
ton four years ago, as W&L’s first
full-time voice teacher. His duties
now also include directing the
glee club and conducting several
music history courses.

What does W&L offer its stu
dents in 1977 in the way of
music, both through instruction

and in extracurricular activities?
Besides the courses (six in his-
tory and appreciation, twelve
offerings in applied music, ten
in theory) taught by a small but
quite competent staff of three,
there is the Glee Club, the Sa-
eracs and Southern Comfort for
students who are vocally inclined;
the Jazz Ensemble, the Brass and
Percussion Ensemble, and small
ensembles for various combina
ions of instruments. Students
also can participate in Lexing
ton’s community orchestra and
horus. The prime force fo
scheduling concerts on campus is
the Concert Guild, composed of
students interested in bringing
juality performers to campus, a

taught appreciation courses. An
Independent Major with Emphasis
in Musie (either musicology or
composition) is possible, although
a departmental major in the
normal sense of the word is not
available.

The major problem confonting
the Music Division and students
taking courses therein is that of
space. Current space available for
music practice rooms and class-
rooms is divided between the
basement of the Student Center
and McCormick Library, not the
best of locations for a music class.
There just is not room at present
to accommodate the various
classes and activities in the limit-
ed facilities available. There is
only one classroom for apprecia-
tion courses and for audio fa-
cilities—students studying tapes
or records must vacate the room
during class sessions.

The problem is acute for those
involved in composition and
applied music. There are just four
practice rooms and one small
classroom. Vying for practice time
are 12 piano students, 12 composi-
tion students, 6 voice students,
several violin students, a glee club
pianist, a glee club, two singing
groups, and four or more en-
sembles. When the larger groups
practice none of the rooms are
available for use, because of the

close proximity and lack of
acoustical insulation between
them.

Access to the rooms in the Stu-
dent Center is allowed from 8 a.m.
to 1 am., though effective time
use is limited to 3 p.m.-1 a.m.
because of individual lessons and
classes offered during the morn.-
ings and early afternoons. Music
students are required to practice
five hours per week. The glee
club meets four days a week.
Other groups often practice to
gether. Needless to say, finding
a room in which to practice can
be a difficult task on this campus,
and is well nigh impossible dur-
ing most normal hours of the day

Because of space and schedul-
ing limitations thirty-five students
were refused admission into In

this past fall. There are twenty-
six students on a waiting list to
take instruction in piano from

who wants music is not getting it

is to increase the staff, but that
cannot be done until more space
is made available. Plans to aug-

formulated, but no one is doing

in only one large group, the Glee

Most importantly, a music ma-

W&L cannot attempt any musical

being to house theatrical pro-

Matmen win 2 of last 3

Joy and jubilation it was not.
But the Washington and Lee
wrestling squad was more than
satisfied after capturing two vic-
tories in three matches last week.
The Generals routed ODAC foe
Eastern Mennonite 30-15 last
Wednesday and split a triangular
match with Duke University and
George Mason on Saturday.

The victory over George Mason,
an exciting 19-18 decision, was
particularly satisfying to the W&L
matmen but it was the Eastern
Mennonite match that counted for
the most as it was a conference
team. However, the coach and
team members did not appear to
be overly satisfied about the final
results of that match.

Freshman Todd Wohler, a 15-
10 winner in the 158 pound class,
commented on the Mennonite
contest saying, “We expected
them to be pretty easy and as
a result I don’t think we wrestled
as well as we could have. I know
I didn’t.” Team captain Jim
Crytzer readily agreed with
Wohler. “Everyone took them a

little too lightly.”
Some excuse is available for

the wrestling squad, however, as
even Coach Gary Franke saw no
challenge from Mennonite. In
faet, he did not wrestle many of
his first unit members so that
the younger members could get a
chance. Franke pointed out that
“We used most of our younger
people to give them some experi-
ence. We saw some good things
out of them.” The Generals lost
only three out of the ten weight
classes but they only managed to

Basketball

A suceessful week, indeed.
Entering the week, the basketball
Generals were 8-2 overall, and 2-1
and in second place in the Old
Dominoin Athletic Conference
race. The team is now sporting
an overall record of 10-2, with a
league mark of 4-1. and holding
a share of first place.

The two league victories were
key ‘wins, 75-70 over Lynchburg,
and 98-78 over Eastern Mennonite.
The come from behind win over
the Hornets in Lynchburg was
important not only for the team’s
won-loss record, but should the
Generals and Lynchburg tie for
the conference title in regular
season play, W&L would be de-
clared champion on the strength
of the teams two victories over
Lynchburg. Earlier this season,
W&L defeated the Hornets 91-87

Coach Verne Canfield had this
to say about the win over the
Generals’ arch-rival, “The players
never gave up in the face of ad-
versity. Despite trailing by such
a large margin early in the game,
the team never doubted that they
would come back and bring home
the victory.” The Generals trailed
by as many as nineteen early in
the first half at 27-8 and 29-10,

but managed to cut the Hornets * which

halftime lead to six at 37-31.

record one pin, that by Ray
Gross in the 150 pound division.
The lopsided win left the Gen-
erals with a 2-0 mark in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.

Saturday, W&L faced possibly
two of the toughest opponents on
their schedule this year. This time
the homestanding Generals were
not about to take anybody lightly.
But then, neither was Duke as
they proved by hammering the
Generals 30-10. The sting of their
second defeat of the season was
erased, however, by a clutch win
over George Mason,

Coach Franke commented on
the triangular meet saying, ‘‘Duke
has traditionally been tough for
us. They were just a little too
tough for us to handle. But Dan
Kniffen came through with a
victory to put us over George
Mason.” Ed ‘Stork’ Rogers was
even more lavish in the praise
of his teammates. “I thought the
team really wrestled well. We
wrestled real smart. It was just
a real good team victory.”

Everyone agreed that it was
the performance of Kniffen in the
heavyweight class that keyed the
victory over GM. The Generals
were sluggish in the early going
and found themselves behind 12-0
against Mason before they could
score a victory. W&L wrestled
valiantly from behind until the
score was 18-16 with Kniffen fac-
ing Stanley in the final event.
Kniffen came up with a big sec-
ond round for a 9-3 decision and
the team victory. But the Gen-
erals never had a chance against

a strong Duke contingent as only
Gross, Crytzer and Bill Cole were
able to record victories in their
individual divisions. The Generals
are now 5-2 on the season.

Gross and Crytzer were the best
wrestlers of the week as neither
one was defeated. Gross recorded
two decisions (12-4, 5-1) and a pin.
Cryter remained undefeated for
the season with two decisions 13-5
and 10-3.

The next match for W&L will
be Saturday at Charleston, South
Carolina in the Citadel Tourna-
ment. At least one member of the
squad feels that this will be a
big match for the Generals.
Crytzer declared, “The Citadel
Tournament always has good com-
petition. I think it will be a
good tournament for us.” The
grapplers captain further predict-
ed that the ODAC championship
will very likely be won by W&L—
a sentiment expressed by many
of the wrestlers. As Crytzer
noted, “I don’t see any reason
why we can’t take eight indi-
vidual championships out of the
ten weight classes.”

Although the ODAC team
championship certainly seems al-
tainable, it will be a tall order
for W&L to capture eight indi-
vidual titles. It will be even
tougher if Howdy Knipp, twice
a letterman and ex-VCAA champ-
ion, does not recover from a re-
cent injury. His loss has weakened
the W&L club in the lower weight
classes. Regardless, the Generals
appear to be headed for a very
successful season.

En garde! ‘Thrust!

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

Attention: It is that time of
year again for all new extra-
curricular and athletic clubs to
arise and approach the E.C. for
funds to get off the ground. This
year’s anticipated crowd is being
led by the W&L Fencing Club,
founded by resident psychologist,
Dr. James Worth.

Last week the E.C. appropri-
ated $100 to the Fencing Club
after Dr. Worth convinced them
that there was substantial student

team defeats Lynchburg, EMC

With 6:50 remaining in the con-
test, W&L took the lead for the
first time all evening on a break-
away basket by senior Chris Lar-
son. They were never to trail
again. An important factor in the
win was that the Generals’ bench
came through with 16 points for
the evening compared to Lynch-
burg’s two, Despite the early defi-
cit, the Generals consistently
and confidently chipped away at
the lead until they managed to
take it, and held it with, as Can-
field said, “Some heady, smart
basketball.”

Lynchburg’s last chance for re-
venge this season will have to
come in the ODAC tournament,
scheduled for February 25th and
26th at W&L. The top four con-
ference teams determined by
regular season won-loss record
qualify for the tourney, with the

tournament champion receiving
the automatic berth to the

NCAA's South Atlantic Regional.

The Hornets defeated Hamp-
den-Sydney 76-74 last Saturday
to put the Tigers and W&L into
1 virtual tie for first place. The
Generals are actually leading with

anxiously awaiting the second
meeting between the two teams,
scheduled for January 25th in
Farmville. If the Generals can
claim that victory, they could virt-
ually clinch the regular season
conference title, and secure them-
selves of being the top seed in
the February. tournament.

Pat Dennis had a week players
dream of, scoring 17 against
Lynehburg on 8-12 from the field,
and hitting for 30 points against
EMC on 15 of 23 from the field.
For the two games, the junior
guard averaged 23.5 ppg and had
a .65 shooting percentage. He also
had nine rebounds against the
Royals.

Chris Larson continued his out-
standing play off the bench, hit-
ting for 12 second half points
in Lynchburg, and adding 22 in
the win over EMC. Co-captain Bob
Flint, the Generals’ most con-
sistent player, had 16 points and
10 :ebounds against the Hornets,
and scored 19 points and grabbed
12 carons last Friday. Dave Leunig
and Don Berlin also hit double
figures in the 75-70 victory over
Lynchburg, with 12 and 10 points,
respectively.

Point guard Mike Wenke, a 5-10
sophomore, tossed 11 assists
EMC to set a new school record
for one game. Wenke has now
thrown 76 assists in the teams’
12 games, and with 14 games re
maining, appears a sure bet to
shatter the seasonal record of 122

interest to warrant such a grant.

Monday, in a return plea for
funds, the Club was granted

another $80 and the E.C. agreed
to loan them $100 more due to
the enthusiasth which the fencers
showed in starting their club.

Thirty-five potential fencers at-
tended the organizational meeting
two weeks ago and 12-15 members
have already ordered equipment,
which they will pay for them-
selves. Although only about 23
students attended the first two
practice sessions last week, Worth
is “delighted with the club so
far. | think the response shown
to the idea of a fencing club here
at W&L has been excellent.”

Worth has hopes of fielding an
intercollegiate fencing team. “If
by the end of this year we have
at least 6 students interested
enough to continue in the sport
and if we pick up two or three
freshmen next fall, then we can
definitely field a team. If by the
fall we have 12 fencers, then we'll
be in good shape.”

In fencing, three weapons are
ised: the foil, with which only
the point you can seore on the
upper body; the sabre, with which
the whole blade is a weapon on
the entire body: and the epee, in
which the entire body is target
to only the point.

three men per weapon, with three
alternates, and each fencer gets
a chance to fence every opposing
fencer, in his specialty. The team
that wins a pluralty of the
matches wins the meet.

Dr. Worth, reigning Virginia
state champion, became interested
in fencing back in high school
in Dayton, Ohio. “I joined the
Dayton Fencing Club while I was
a junior in high school and we
practiced at the local YMCA. I
gave it up because of studies, but
later joined the Ohio State team,
fencing varsity for three years
and lettering two years.” Worth
lost interest in the sport over the
next ten years, but then came to

Lexington where he met Tad
Humphries, VMI fencing coach
and captain of the 1942 W&L

Fencing Team. (W&L hasn’t had
a team since WWII). Needless to
say, Worth regained his interest.

“We hope the interest in-W&L
fencing will grow. It is a sport
in which someone with no previ-

ous athletic experience can
participate and participate sue-
cessfully. In fact, 95% of the

people who take up fencing, do so
after they have begun college. So
there is no reason for people who
think they will start behind the
others in talent to stay away.

Sen. Biden speaks on the new administration

Committees and is a member of
the Select Committee on Intellig-
ence.

Considered one of the most out-
spoken men in Congress, Carter’s
National Campaign Manager
spoke with a self-admitted bias.

According to Biden, energy
problems “permeate and overlap”
all other problems facing Carter.
He said he expects to see Carter
send Congress a bill concerning
major reorganization of the
energy agencies within the next
three months. He said the bill will
be based on the premise that we
must eventually become energy
independent.

“A failure to do so may mean
we can make no _ independent
foreign policy decisions in the
future,” he said.

“President-elect Carter will
come out within the next six
months with an energy conserva-
tion program in which he will ask
the American people to make con-
siderable sacrifices,” Biden said.
“I think the American people will
rally behind this common prob-
lem.”

“The second part of the pro-
gram will make serious efforts
in the direction of alternative

trial.”

Pentifallo said he is bothered
by claims that any student was
tried unfairly. “They're question-
ing my integrity,” he said.

E.C. members refused to com-
ment further on the trial, since
the ease is still open and the
White Book forbids their releas-
ing information about any pri-
vate trial.

Administration officials were
still in conference with the E.C.
and the defense advisers at 1:30
\Vednesday afternoon.

Brooks said this incident is just
one example of the kind of prob-
loms black students have faced at
&L since the university inte
grated in 1970.

Wednesday afternoon members
of SABU were bringing groceries
into the area where they were
waiting. Many of them had
brought books to read. “We are
prepared to stay here and make
hings difficult in the operation
of this building,” Brooks said.

sources,” he said.

He said curing the economic ills
of Western Europe is a necessity
and also said that Carter re-
cognizes that economic policy has
a greater effect on foreign policy
than any other single factor.

Biden was very critical of the
way the U.S. gocernment is handl-
ing nuclear power in regard to
foreign countries.

“We are exporting nuclear cap:
ability not only to world powers,
but also to banana dictators,” he
said. “That’s stupid.”

Biden said China should be high
on the list of foreign aid priori-
ties and said he thought the
climate in the Middle East is cur-
rently good for a peace settle-
ment.

Biden said he expects Carter
to look for “a balance, if there
is one, between inflation and un-
employment” in the domestic eco-
nomy.

While answering questions,
Biden also said that he felt Carter
had no choice but to adopt a more
enlightened policy towards South
Africa.

“It is hypocritical for a white
politician to say he supports black
America and apartheid at the
same time,” he said.

In commenting on his own
reputation as an environmentalist,

Virginia felt about the subject.
According to Biden, Scott once
came up to him and said, “The

environment freaks is that you
think gasoline causes cancer.”

This is not the first time dis-
satisfaction with student govern-
ment actions has prompted
SABU to stage a protest.

In October, 1975, the organiza-
tion held a rally and march
around the dormitories. Accord-
ing to SABU spokesmen at the
time, the rally was to express
their anger about the lack of
black entertainment on campus
and at the lack of concern shown
black problems by the E.C. and
Student Activities Board.

Later in the year SABU refused
‘o continue aiding the Recruit-
ment Committee in bringing black
students to W&L.

Brooks said at that time that
SABU could not continue to ask
biack students to come to a
s-hool where the organization felt
they were not welcome.

This year’s freshman class of
406 contained only two black stu-
dents.

The protests last year brought
about the formation of the Mi-
nority Affairs Co-ordinating Com-

WAL had fencing before, and
Dr. Worth wants to bring it back
again. Not only does he feel that

Fencing sharpens the mind and

Hopefully, it also will instill a

When asked about the recent

such a reinstatement.

Col. Moellering said he felt
cadets should be reinstated on a

honor system, specifically the
absolute penalty of expulsion for
all offenses. But he held that the
honor code itself was sound.

The panel arguea that the
volunteer army was not costing
the taxpayers more than a drafted
army, and as volunteers began to
serve longer costs would actually
decrease as training costs
dropped .Many of the increases in
military costs were due to in-
creases in the pay scales ordered
by the Congress before the
changeover to an all-volunteer
force, ’

The panel also emphasized that
today’s army was of a higher
quality than the drafted force,
due to the higher education levels
of recruits.

_Unionization of the Army was
dismissed by Col. Boone as “pos-
sible, but not probable.” Boone

said the Army would probably not
be unionized because it already
is a union of sorts. He said junior
officers and non-commissioned
officers serve as shop stewards and
the Inspector General Corps
serves as a grievance committee.
Boone said the reason many
European armies unionized was
because they didn’t receive the
pay scale and benefits considered
standard in America.

A discussion of infantry tactics
and American policy in Asia and
Europe again brought out the de-
terrent role of the Army. The
panel argued that to be effective,
defense policy should not cut any
options which the army might
have in defending interests in
Japan, Korea and Europe.

The panel’s appearance at W&L
was sponsored by the W&L Mili-
tary Science department.

Honor case ended;

grievances remain

By HALE DELAVAN

This is the first half of a
two-part article on the contro-
versy surrounding the recent
honor trial of a black student
and the complaints from the
Student Association for Black
Unity.

Much of this report is based
on interviews with members of
SABU. Details of honor trials
are hard to get from the E.C.,
even in such a well-publicized
incident, because of the White
Book stipulation that a trial is
private until a public honor
trial is held.

Junior Raynard Scott learned
of his impending honor trial be-
fore the E.C. on Jan. 17. The trial
was held the following evening
from 7 pm. to midnight. Scott
was represented by two law stu-
dents, Johnny Morrison and Eu-
gene Perry, and Assistant Dean
of Students Curtis Hubbard sat
in as an observer.

One source close to the E.C.
said later that Hubbard’s presence
was unprecedented for an honor
trial, but that the E.C. wanted
to avoid any claims of racism on
their part at a later date.

A SABU spokesman said the
atmosphere of the trial was un-
professional and the E.C. mem-
bers were uncourteous to the
accused. A member of the E.C.
said later that apologies were ex-

SNu fire spurs
IFC inspection

By REX NYQUIST

A fire last month at the Sigma
Nu house has led to safety in-
spections of all fraternity houses
by the Inter-Fraternity Council.
An IFC inspection committee be-
gan the checks last week and will
inspect three houses a week.

The Sigma Nu house suffered
minor damage in mid-January
when a support beam beneath
the living room fireplace caught
fire because the asbestos pad
under the fireplace had deteriorat-
ed, Fortunately, smoke alarms
detected the fire and the fire
department was quickly called to
put it out. Sigma Nu President
Joe] Mohrmon estimated damage
at about $1000-$1500.

The IFC established the inspec-
tion committee after the fire was
brought to its attention. By bring-
ing existing defects to the at-
tention of each fraternity house,
the IFC hopes to prevent similar
fires in the future.

The committee will examine the
struetare and exterior premises of
each house, and check the condi-
tion of walls, floors and windows.
The heating, water and electrical
systems will also be studied for
defects.

The IFC is also considering the
purchase of smoke detectors for
those houses which may want
them. Aceording to IFC President
Alfred Robinson, detectors will
probably be mandatory for fra-
ternity houses in the future.

The

tended from both sides following
the trial, which ended when Scott
told the E.C. he would withdraw
from the university rather than
face any more of what he con-
sidered unfair treatment from the
E.C.

The next morning some twenty
members of SABU came to Dean
of Students Lewis John’s office
to complain about the trial. Dur-
ing the previous night they also
deided to bring up other griev-
ances that, according to SABU
president Mike Brooks, have been
pending since 1971.

The students were referred to
President R. E. R. Huntley and
remained in his office until 8 p.m.
They were prepared to stay all
night. They left when the E.C.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, FEBRUARY 3, 1977

 

Ambassador Talcott W. Seelye

Ambassador speaks on Africa,

Lebanon in Contact speeches

“U.S. interests in southern Africa
are no different than they are
anywhere else in the world” said
Ambassador Talcott W. Seelye last
Monday night in Lee Chapel.
“Those goals are to point out the
interdependence of nations and
seek peace and stability,” said
the former Ambassador to Tu-
nisia.

This year’s second Contact
speaker has served in a number
of State Department posts in-
volving Africa and the Mid-East.
Last June he served as a special
emissary to Lebanon for Presi-
dent Ford. He currently holds
the post of Deputy Assistant See-
retary of State for African Affairs.

According to Seelye, U.S. in-
terests in Africa were brought
to world attention after the fall
of the Portuguese empire in Mo-
zambique and Angola. Until that
time, Seelye said, it was felt that
Africa was the responsibility of
European nations.

Secretary of State Kissinger’s
last minute attempt to bring
black majority rule to Rhodesia
was seen es having little chance
of suecess by the black ruled na-
tions surrounding Rhodesia,
Seelve said. He said Kissinger con-
vineed Prime Minister lan Smith
to announce a plan to gradually
bring about black majority rule,
explaining the decision as an ex-

pression of Rhodesian self in-
terest.
Despite the holdup in the

negotiations at the Geneva con
ference which resulted from Kis-
singer's actions, Seelye sees sev-
eral positive factors.

Among these are the evolution
of the official Rhodesian position.
the fact that a negotiating effort
has been launched with both sides
agreeing that it is useful, a reali-
zaiion by moderate black nation-
alists leaders that negotiation and

This week’s Ring-tum Phi in-
view is with Chuck Rogers,
president of the College Re-
publicans, the largest extra-
curricular club on the WAL
campus.

By DAVID W. TALLEY, JR.

ReP: What is the College Re
publican Club's objectice?

Rogers: The objective of the
Club is to expose students to Re
publican philosophy and give
them the epportunity to partici
pate directly in the political
process.

RtP: What plans does the Club
have?

Rogers: We are trying to ar-
range mixers with Mary Wash
ington, Randolph-Macon, Long
wood, Sweet Briar, and Southern
Seminary, both here and at their
schools. We are contacting sev-
eral influencial Republican lead
ers to come to W&L to present
the Republican philosophy. We
are also hoping that members of
the Club will aitend the CRF\
eonvention this weekend becaus:
it will better aequaint them with
state polities, dive them the op
portunity to meet several candi

not revolution is the course which
will bring them te power, the
British involvement in the negoti-
ations and the fact that the
United States is planning to con-
tinue its push in the area for
black majority rule.

Seelye said that black majority
rule will come soon in Rhodesia,
to be folowed by black majority
rule in Namibia, formerly South
West Africa, and eventually in
South Afriea.

Seelye differentiated between
the regimes in Rhodesia and South
Africa, saying the black leaders
consider the Rhodesian govern-
ment to be coloniai, with four
million whites making up only
four per cent of the population,
and the South African government
legitimate, with the apartheid
policy as the only issue. The four
million whites in South Africa
make up almost 25% of the
population.

Earlier in the day, Seelye spoke
to a small group in duPont Audi-
torium about Lebanon.

He said the Arab world needs
a free-wheeling zone like Lebanon,
with its free trade, open banking
policies and free-wheeling society,
to operate as a safety valve for
the Mid-East.

Seeive said the civil war in
Lebanon was due to political ten
sion incorporated into the Leb-
anese government by the French
when they left the area in 1946
“Maronite Christians. then a ma-
jority of the populalion, were te

Moslems would hold the Premier-
ship. The Christians are no longer
the majority, but the traditional
method of government has held

Tensions were exacerbated by
the presence of Palestinian lib
eration forces in south Lebanon
and fighting broke out between
Palestinians and Moslems on one

daies for Republican nomination
to state offices, and also have a
good time.

RIP: Speaking of the College
Republican Federation of Vir-
ginia: there has been talk of some
disagreement between the W&L
Republican Club and the CRFV
What about this?

Rogers: The CRFV believes the
hasic emphasis of a college Re-
publican movement is to get
people working in the campaigns
We believe the first requisite of
getting people in the campaign is
to get more people in the clubs
ind establish new clubs, and then
to involve those people in cam

paidns. The bie difference is one
of priorities
In the past three years, the

CRVF has not fulfilled its obliga
tions in either membership or
campaign due to ineffective lead
ership. This vear things have im
proved slightiv for the college
iepublicean movement, partially

because of the increased role
WAL has taken in establishing
new clube and helping other
clubs in the state

side and the Christians on the
other. The Army, split almost in
half along religious lines, was not
able to stablize the situation.

In January 1976, the Syrian
Army moved into Lebanon in an
effort to bring peace to the area.

Since then, Seelye said he has
seen some improvement in the
situation. He said the Palestinians
realized they could not win against
the Syrian Army and began to
negotiate, the Lebanese Moslems
began cooperating with the Maro-
nite Christians again to remove
the Syrian invaders and that the
Svriens have the power to pre.
vent either the Christians or the
Moslems from becoming too
strong in the immediate future.

Cross gets blood

Despite a high rejection rate,
the W&L Blood Drive exceeded
its 125-pint goal by nine pints
last Thursday.

According to Bill Kerr, organiz-
er-at-large for the College Re-
publicans, at least 165 people
showed up to give blood. With
an average rejection rate of 10
per cent for donors, the 31 turned
away represents almost double
the normal rate.

Several Red Cross nurses at the
drive atiributed the large nur-
ber of rejections to colds.

Zeta Beta Tau won the keg of
heer offered to the fraternity with
the highest turn-out. Sixty-four
per cent of its members showed

the drive.

 

RtP: The W&L Republicans are
not accustomed to losing. How did
the result of the presidential
election affeet the Club?

Rogers: It was a big disappoint
ment, but both Byrd and Buller
won. The facet that the Demo
erats are running the national
government is giving people more
incentive to elect Republicans to
state office. Now, the Democrats
will earn the eredit for what

the ones to blame for what goes

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Division
of power

Proposition: The creation of a separate and autonomous
Honor Court for the sole purpose of hearing honor cases.

One of the really marvelous features of the Constritution
of the United States is the division of government into separate
branches. The idea, of course, is that no branch will be more
powerful than the others; this is achieved through the mutual
checks and balances exercised by each branch upon the others ;
Thus the government is designed to regulate itself, prevent-
ing, in theory, the overstepping or misuse of power,

At Washington and Lee, no such division of power exists.
The Executive Committee exercises not only executive but
also legislative and judicial authority, ineaning in effect that
it writes, interprets and enforces its own regulations. While
it is true that the members of the E.C. are freely elected, it is
also true that once elected, they are free to use their extensive
powers however they see fit.

This might not seem so bad. We are not, after all, an im-
mensely powerful nation—only a small college community
without real problems or issues, The single-branch system
has worked pretty well for a long time. In fact, compared to
tnany other college governments in the region, the E.C. is
the very model of efficiency.

Yet there is room, even the need, for improvement, Recent
events have raised an important question: To whom is the
iC. answerable when accused of violating its own rules? The
answer, under the present system: Only to itself,

To counter the dangers inherent in such an unregulated
system, I propose the creation of an Honor Court, a separate
‘undicial branch of govrnment with the responsibility of hear-
ing all honor cases. The potential value of moving to such
4 system is great. If one shares the assumption that the
principles of honor are the most important principles under-
living the entire University community, then one should
consider this proposition seriously and carefully.

The hearing of honor cases would be the sole responsibility
of the Honor Court, Free from outside influences and other
(read: political) considerations, the Court could guarantee
impartiality in all deliberations. Furthermore, should questions
ol procedure arise, they could be submitted to the ELC. for
review, circumventing the lack of regulation which comes with
self-regulation.

| do not propose to spell out in detail the man) aspects
and problems of the Court's creation and composivion, Cer-
tainly, it would require extensive consitutional changes, One
feature | would-advoeate is a rotating membership w hereby
students are called upon to serve limited terms on the Court
in such a manner that greatest possible number of students
would have the opportunity to serve at least once during Useir
college careers. This would yenerate greater
familiarity with the Honor System among students and henee
possibly reduce the number of honor violations.

There is much to be said about this idea, .\ student
referendum is in order, If you have thoughts on the subject,
vet them down on paper and send them to us. If sufficient
interest is generated, 1 will respond and formulate more de-

Leonel L. Kahn arrived at W&L
in 1965 to assume the job of pro-
fessor of drama; his reflections
on that period are perhaps the
best insight into what this aera
of fine arts was like, little more
than ten years ago. When he
came, it was known as the Trouba-
dour Theatre, and was more of
a “club” than anything else.

“There were a few people who
did shows as a group — campus
night musical things, and then
some really good dramatic works,”
commented Mr. Kahn. “But the
the entire program was certainly
not geared to the education of
anyone in theatre in depth.”

Obviously, in such a set-up, a
major in drama was unheard of —
as a matter of fact, the catalogue
from the year of Mr. Kahn's
arrival shows a grand total of
4 drama courses (one term each
of acting, design, directing, and
theatre history), as opposed to the
14 or so courses offered today.
There were only two shows each
year, one for each semester.

But, the worst facet of all—the
thing that gave the drama de-
partment the “clubbish” reputa-
tion that it is still trying to
beat down—was the audition sys-
tem. Until the mid-sixties, it’s
pretty hard to say just what the
exact system was; they were
either by invitation or ‘“semi-
closed,” tending to make the
Troub even more isolated.

“One of the first things I did
upon. arriving at Washington and
Lee was to throw the audition
system wide open to all comers,”
said Kahn. “I remember when
word got around the Troubadour
what the new teacher was going
to do. A deputation of the present
actors, etc., arrived at my house

- late one night—and told me that

this move would totally destroy
the theatre! But I felt that a
chance had to be taken for the
benefit of the liberal-arts phil-
sophy of this university.” And,
to be truthful, the opening of
auditions did indeed destroy the
Troubadour Theatre Club—it was
on its way to becoming an honest-
to-God drama department.

Another event which may be
considered a benchmark in the
department's history would be the
production of Marat-Sade in 1968.
In the 1960's, it goes without
saying that fraternities were, to
put ii mildly, the absolute dicta-
tors of student affairs. For a long
time, those people interested in
drama had allowed themselves to
turn inward, until they were a
sort of fraternity, too. The fact
that there was little or no cross-
over between these ‘two worlds’
limited the manpower of the
theatre greatly. But, then came
Marat-Sade, a very experimenta!
show that needed a large cast.
It was at this point that they
succeeded in getting some fra-
ternity members to participate.

The show was a tremendous
suecess, one of the first educa
tional theatrical productions of
the show in the entire country—
and the theatre never lacked for
manpower from that time. So,
progress continued to be the
watchery of the theatre; this is
best shown by a very quiet transi-
tion that occured in 1972. The
Troubadour Theatre was officially
renamed the University Theatre,
and Mr. Kahn and his colleagues
had given W&L an open depart-
ment in name as well as in spirit.

The purpose of the new depart-
ment was to expand in quantity,
while retaining the quality which
had marked most of the Trouba-
dour Club shows. This meant
several new courses: an added
term for the areas ofacting, di-
recting, and theatre art; courses
in makeup, stage, and costume
design; and most recently, styles
courses which give the student
an indepth look at a certain facet
of theatre craft.

\ major step forward was taken
with the creation of “total
theatre.” Mr. Kahn comments:
“When the University announced
plans for the creation of a shori
term for the areas of acting. di-
the chance to create a course like
this. Total theatre allows us to
establish a company attitude: in
the six weeks we have one group
ef people who do everything. as
opposed to the usual show-by
show arrangement.” The total
theatre students have presented
such shows in the past as

Othello, The Tempest, and Peer
Gynt.

Drama 202, supervised study
abroad, allows the student to see
what’s going on outside the local
area. London is the focus of
these operations; there is more
there in terms of quantity and
quality (such as the National and
Royal Shakespeare companies)
than anywhere else.

So, the theatre, like the other
areas in fine arts, is in a period
of transition—progress has come,
but there is certainly a long way
to go. One thing that the faculty
would like to see is an increase
in the visit of professionals in
the field. Some steps in this area
have been taken already; the
Polish mime company which per-
formed here earlier in the year
is réturning to teach for several
weeks this term as part of the
Drama 140 styles course.

Another new concept being in-
troduced is a new type of senior
thesis—in play writing, along
with the original specialties in

acting, directing, or scenic design. .

Already, some beginning is being
made in this area; two one act
plays by sophomores John Jacob-
sen and Taylor Harbison will be
produced this March.

But often, educational theatre
is only so good as the facilities
it provides—and it is here that
the drama department faces its
biggest needs and challenges.
Things were once worse, if that
ean be imagined; in the mid-six-
ties, there was no lobby, no heat,
no makeup rooms or faculty
offices, and no workshop. Mr.
Kahn's first office was a small
glass cubicle. located somewhere
off stage right. and probably
bought at a Centel telephone-
booth sale. Actors sat on the
steps offstage, in costume, and

waited there for their cues. The
“auditorium” was composed of
wooden chairs on a flat wooden
floor--and so forth. Since then,
a shop has been added on, as
with the lobby, and the upstairs
was converted into new office
space and dressing roms. And
now, the Boiler Room appeared
this year, to supplement the
Troubadour as a second facility.
Yet, it certainly isn’t the light at
the end of the tunnel. “It gives
us, primarily another performing
area and more space for re-
hearsal—in addition to an area
for arena style theatre produc-
tions,’ said Mr. Kahn.

Yet the real necessity remains
-~an all new theatre facility;
something that was built to be
a theatre, not a laundry room or
a horse stble. A new theatre, Mr.
Kahn pointed out, must be multi-
purpose above all, allowing pro-
scenium or thrust set productions;
an adequate workshop — no more
building your set on the stage or
in the audience area for lack
of space; and a classroom and
rehearsal room space. One thing
that the entire staff agree on
emphatically, is that this is ab-
solutely essential now, in these
years—not as some hazy, long-
term, pigeonholed plan. “We've
done about al lhere in the pres-
ent facility that is feasible.”

So many things such as musi-
cals (with the exception of a
1776, where we had a ready-built
area in Evans Hall), cannot be
staged where the department is
located now. Anyone who attends
the theatre regularly at W&L
should come out with two feel-
ings especially: admiration for
the ingenuity of the people who
have to work in this structure
(and even the word “structure”

is gilding the lily), and a great
hope that one day, they will be
able to enjoy a facility that is
worthy of them.

Lee Kahn is optimistic, though
-—-very optimistic. He says:
“People should remember what
drama is like now, and compare
it to twenty years ago. It’s a
wide-open place today; this is
the greatest step forward.
Whether you crave theatre work
as a vocation or as an extra-
curricular activity, is here for
you now. !’m not sure really how
much we should expand, for we
don’t want to betray the liberal
arts idea here. But, our quality
certainly has to be enhanced, and
the key to that now is a new
theatre building. After all, we’ve
Ss program all ready to put
in if.”

It’s true—all the department
really needs is a place to show-
case all the talent it already has:
from other members of the staff,
Ai Gordon and Tom Ziegler (the
former is the C, B. DeMille of
W&L, who directed last year’s
inbulous 1776; the latter arrived
this year—and has already made
a name for himself with his
imaginative sets and publicity
“posters), to the steadily growing
number of majors themselves —
seven alone this year. It would
seem that the drama division re-
flects the state of the fine arts
as a whole, in its steady and sure
progress, adided by an administra-
tion anxious to put it at the
same quality level as Newcomb
or Howe Halls...

This concludes the Ring-tum
Phi’s investigation series on the
fine arts at W&L. Special thanks
for this series go to the Fne Arts
faculty, whose cooperation made
it all possible from the beginning.

Troubadours score with
Virginia Woolf production

By RICHARD S. WOLF

The University Theatre is offer-
ing its third major production of
the year this week with a pre-
sentation of Edward Albee’s
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.
This contemporary American
drama is undoubtedly the master-
piece of Albee’s canon and as
such, is a very difficult play to
pull off. I must admit that T was
a bit sceptical -when I entered
the Troub, but these apprehen-
sions were soon dispelled. This
production is nothing lass than
superb and was a delight to ex
perience. | would even go so far
as to say that this is the finest
production that I have seen on
the W&L stage.

Senior drama major Brian
Garr had the ambition to under-
take the direction of this play
for his thesis work. His under-
standing of Albee’s intentions and
his handling of them is con-
sistently good throughout the
production with few excepiions.
There is so much going on in this
play and so many themes that are
developed that Ht is a herculean
task to even keep them all
straight. Garr comes very close
to perfection with his develop-
ment of the major points of the
play, but there is one theme that
deserves more attention. For all
of the hate and injury that Georce
and Martha heap upon each other,
there is a basis of deep love
that underlies their entire relat
ionship. This point was certainly
not ignored by Garr, but it should
have been developed to a greater
degree in the first act instead o!
emerging unheralded in the third
act. For it is George's love and
concern fer Martha that catses
him to undertake his most hostile
acts to exorcise her of the illusion
that is keeping them apart. The
love hate relationship of the two
leads is central to the entire
play and should have been dea!
with more fully.

One of the major obstacles in
doing Virginia Woolf at a college
level is finding actors that can
eonvineingly portray the middic
agedness of George and Martha
This is really central to their
viability as characters who exude
billerness and = world-wearine
\fki they cannal be convincing!

portrayed by twenty year-olds
with frosted haid and lots of
lines drawn on their faces.
Happily, Brian Garr did not at-
tempt this, but rather cast his
play appropriately. W&L fine arts
director Al Gordon played George
to Suzanne Dieckerman’s Martha.
Ms. Dieckman is the director of
theatre at Southern Sem and even
though she is certainly not near
Martha’s ‘iftyish’, she was suf-
fieiantiy stuffed into her jump-
suit to convince us that she was
not a co-ed. Both of these actors
performed admirably and were
able to develop and sustain the
level of emotion and tension that
a successful performance of their
roles demands. I was particularly
impressed by Professor Gordon
who proved that he could go
beyond the mere character work
of his role in an earlier production
this year. Uncle Vanya.

Paut Morella and Caroline
Cromelin both did very well as
Nick and Honey, though I felt
that the latter came on a bit

strong in her early scenes. These
are very difficult roles to play as

they can easily be drowned out
by the intensity of George and
Martha. But both Morella and
Cromelin were able to sustain
enough presence to succeed in
their characterizations

LETTERS TQ THE EDITOR

Dear Sir:

I detect a strong attitude on
campus, particularly among the
members of the Student Activi-
ties Board, that goes something
like this: “O.K., we've satisfied
that half of the student body
which prefers rock music with
our winter concert, so now we
will have to satisfy that half
which prefers soul by having a
soul band for our spring concert.”
I find this attitude wrong in two
important respects.

First of all, | don't believe that
the student body is divided fifty-
fifty on the issue. I think that a
marked majority of W-L’s stu-
denis would prefer rock to soul

Generals’ twin victories
earn them top ODAC seed

By ROBERT S. BATES and
J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

The W&L basketball team con-
tinued its winning ways last week
by taking two ODAC conference
games. On Tuesday night the Gen-
erals traveled to Farmville to take
on the always tough Hampden-
Sydney Tigers. The Generals lost
an earlier meeting to the Tigers
and were determined this time to
come back vietorious.

‘The game started off fast with
both teams hitting their first
four shots. From that point on,
the game emerged into a seesaw
battle with the lead changing
hands a total of 23 times. Late in
the second half the Generals
were up by as many as nine
points, but were not able to hold
off a late Sydney surge as the
Tigers cut the General lead to
two. The fourth quarter chant of
“Go to hell, Generals” did little

to unnerve the Generals. With
five seconds remaining in the
game and the score tied, Chris

Larson calmly canned a fifteen
footer icing the game for the

Local resorts

beckon skiers

By REID SLAUGHTER

If there is one good thing
zbout the chilling weather of late
it is that along with the low
temperature comes snow, and
that means some of the best ski-
ing in Virginia in the last five
years.

With the conditions good, ski
fever has hit the campus of W&L
and hundreds of students are
taking off for the slopes each
week. There are three good re-
sorts, all fairly close to here, that
deserve mentioning:

Massanutten—-Five miles north
of Harrisonburg on 81, Massa-
nutten Ski Village has the most
to offer. It has nine different
runs, night skiing (til 10:30,
Tues.Sat.), and excellent restaur-
ant/warming house faeility, and
competent ski school instruction.
The best deal here is to join P.E.
167 and ski for credit, as you get
six two-hour lessons and six half-
day lift tickets for only $39.00
($21.00 if you have your own
skis).

Homestead — About 50 miles
west of Lexington, The Home-
stead is located in Het Springs.
Although it has one of the nicest
hotels you'll find anywhere, the
skiing leaves a bit to be desired.
Without the excellent snow-mak-
ing equipment of Massanutten,
there is a surplus of ice.

The Uomestead does have a
lot more than skiing. It has very
good ice skating facilities, and
other mountain activities such as
tobogzaning and bobsledding are
available

Snowshoe—-Farther off in Slaty
Fork, West Virginia, Snowshoe is
about a three-hour drive from
Lexington. This is the place to go
for a weekend, as there is a
dormitory on top of the mountain,
along with live bands on the
weekend, and plenty to do.

With plenty of rvom to ex:
pand, Snowshoe already has more
runs than either Massanutten or
Homestead, and is geared more
for the intermediate to advanced
skiers. The facilities are superb,
and the ski instructors very able.

This is a big year for the ski
industry afier near disaster last
year when high temperatures
melted what little snow there was.
Consequently, there are more and
more new or beginner level skiers
out to whom the following “hints”
are e#iven

(1) Take lessons. No matter how
good you may think you are, you
can always polish up with a les
son, There are lessons at ood
prices for every level skier. Take
advantage of them

(2) Warm up on an easy slope

t iret. Your legs need a chance
to get loose in skiing just as in
any other sport

(3) When you begin to get
tired, stop. 80°. of all injuries

occur in the last hours and a half
of the skiing day

exuberant Generals (76-75).

One of the keys to this game
seemed to be the Generals’ ability
to maintain their poise and stick
to their game plan. Another big
factor was the Generals’ inability
to convert from the charity line.
Coming into the game, the Gen-
erals were the leading free throw
shooting team in Division I. As
a team, they shot only 59% com-
pared to their seasonal 79%.

The Generals as a team out-re-
bounded Sydney 46-20. High scor-
ers for the game were Pat Dennis
and Bob Flint with 23 points
each. By virtue of their victory
over HS, The Generals have: just
about insured themselves of the
top seed in the first ODAC tourna-
ment, coming up later this month.

On Saturday afternoon W&L

played host to the Bridgewater
Eagles. This was not what you
call one of your classical match-
ups. By halftime the Generals
had a comfortable 54-29 lead and
were in total command of the
game. At this point it seemed
as if the only thing in doubt
was whether the Generals were
going to hit the century mark for
the second time this season. But
this was not be! The team play in
the second half was ragged and
resembled a comedy of errors.
Poor passing, numerous turn-
overs, and erratic shooting led to
a disappointing 94-76 final. Pat
Dennis again led all scorers with
25 points, nineteen of which came
in the first half. Dennis is now
averaging 20.3 points per game,
and shoting a phenomenal 58%

from the field. Don Berlin played
one of his finest all around games
of the year scoring 19 points,
and Jeading the team in rebounds
with 10. In all, five Generals
seored in double figures, which is
enough to make any coach happy.

With eight regular season
games remaining, the Generals

need six victories in order to top
the 29 victory level for the second
time in their 51 year history, and
also for coach Vern Canfield to
obtain his 200th career coaching
vi tory. With a winning percent-
age of 875 (third best in Di-
vision Til), W&L is ranked 15th
nationally.

W&L’s next game is tonight at
home against Shenandoah Col-
lege, and Saturday with Virginia
Wesleyan.

Indoor track season begins;
coach and team optimistic

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

W&L’s track team begins its
indoor season Saturday, Feb. 12
with a tri-meet at Lynchburg. The
indoor season is considered by
coach and team as a warmup for
the outdoor season, which begins
in March.

Commenting on this year’s
team, Coach Norris Aldridge said,
“Overall, this year’s team is
stronger than past teams in previ-
ous years. Our strong areas have
John Tucker in the quarter mile;
Paul Thomson—half mile; Tony
Perry—high jump; and Phil Dun-
lay—shot put and 35 Ib. weight.”

Continuing, Aldridge said Larry
Banks, a four-year letterman who
shares the school record in the
440 relay, is the team’s top
sprinter. Sophomore Norvell
Scott has a good chance to break
the school record in the high
jump, long jump, and hurdles.

Aldridge doesn’t think the team
has many weaknesses, except for
lack of depth in some areas,
particularly the distances. He

concedes that W&L may have
some trouble in the one mile,
three mile, and hurdles, but ex-
presses confidence in Allen Weeks
and Richard Bird for the one mile,
Mike Burns (who holds the school
record in the two mile) for the
three mile, and Scott in the
hurdles.

In talking about his competi-
tion in the ODAC, Aldridge said,
“The ODAC is a pretty balanced
league, especially indoors. Once
we move outdoors Bridgewater
should emerge as the dominant
team, especially in the track
events. W&L should finish at least
2nd in the ODAC and should set
some marks in the field events.
It is coneeivable that we could
finish first, despite a strong
Bridgewater team, but a lot de-
pends on our avoiding injuries
and our freshmen producing for
us.”

As Aldridge indicated, one of
W&L’s strong areas is the field
events, especially the weight
events (shot, discus, ete.). Much

of the success in this area can
be attributed to assistant coach
Bill Hansen, a third-year law stu-
dent.. Hansen has put his boys
through an extensive training pro-
gram including weightlifting, run-
ning, and throwing in the spec-
ialties.

Their efforts paid off last year
as team members consistently
placed in the shot, 35 Ib. weight,
and the javelin. This year, the
venerals will have to do with-
out javelin thrower Jack Berry's
talents, but should make up for
the loss in the other categories.

Sophomore Phil Dunlay is ex-
pected to take up much of the
slack. Though not a javelin
thrower, Dunlay could perhaps be
the best weight man in the
ODAC. He already holds the state
small college record in the 35
lb. weight, and is close to break-
ing the school record in the shot
(48°9"). In practice this year
Dunlay has thrown 45’. Last year.
he set a record every time he

Wrestlers defeat H-S, 43-2,

The Washington and Lee wrestl-

llampden-Sydney's best wrestler
and Jim Crytzer wrestled well to
record a 7-3 decision.

Perhaps the most exciting
mateh of the evening was the
last one between the heavy-
weights. Dan Kniffen battled his
opponent evenly throughout the
entire match and with time run-
ning out it leoked like he was
going to have to settle for a
draw. But with only five seconds
left he scored two points on a

Of course, Hampden-Sydney is
by no means a wrestling power-

the Generals wrestled well in roll-
ing to their third dual meet vie-
tory of the year. Furthermore it
seemed a good match, a confi-
dence builder, on which to pre-
pare for the upcoming Virginia
State Meet.

Three days later the Generals
were at the University of Vir-
ginia for that meet which lasted
from eleven in the morning until
about ten at night. Upon enter-
ing the U. Hall (as the students
there call it) one was impressed
with its size. Inside were four
big numbered mats with coaches
and wrestlers streaming around
the floor or filling the stands.

NAACP, Jack Gravely, to explain
Scott’s story and ask for the
organizations’ assistance.

Gravely visited W&L the fol-
lowing day and also wrote to E.C.
President Tom Hunter expressing
his support of Scott’s position,
according to Brooks. SABU is still
seeking NAACP aid in research-
ing the legality of the E.C. actions
in this case, according to Brooks,

but the matter is not getting the
organization’s full attention be-
cause of a situation at the Uni-
versity of Virginia.

The NAACP is currently in-
volved in a case at U.Va. where
the black head of the honor com-
mittee has been asked to resign
by his colleagues because of
charges of inattention to his job
and threats to fellow committee

members.
The gentleman in question
charges that the complaints

against him are racially oriented.

On Jan. 25, Scott was retried
and found guilty by the E.C. He
did not attend the trial and de-
cided following it to ask for a
publie trial before a student jury.

Let’s have another Spinners War!

(Continued from page 2)
If a poll were taken which com-
pared the number of people who
preferred soul to heavy metal
rock, country rock, laid back rock,
or jazz rock, soul would come
out ahead with respect to each of
the other specific categories. But
if a poll were taken to compare
the number who preferred soul -
to rock in general, I’m convinced

that the vast majority would
prefer rock.
Secondly, I don’t think that

W-L’s rock fans were “satisfied”
with the winter concert. I attend-
ed the show and I enjoyed it. But
the three bands that played were
virtual no-names. The S.A.B. did
an excellent job of promoting
and putting on the show, and
drew a large crowd. But I doubt
very seriously that any of the
W-L students who attended would
have travelled to Roanoke or
U.V.A. to see the same concert.
In contrast, last year’s Spinners
concert provided W-L with the

epitome of soul music, the num-
ber one act in their field. An act
from rock of a comparable
stature to the Spinners in soul
would be someone along the line
of the Who, the Eagles, or Bob
Dylan. Obviously ARS isn’t to be
compared with these acts. Just
as obviously the S.A.B. could
never afford them. But the point
is that the rock fan at W-L isn’t
completely satisfied, and would
very much like to see other bands
from other fields of rock.

W-L’s rock fans shouldn’t lay
back now and say O.K. we’ve had
ours now we'll let them have
theirs. They’ve had theirs here

The trial was set for Feb. 1.
According to Brooks, SABU hoped
to buy time to enlist NAACP
aid in bringing an injunction to
prevent further proceedings
against Scott; however, court
action was made difficult by the
fact that the tape of the original
hearing had been destroyed, in
keeping with White Book regula-
tions in private cases.

The public trial was cancelled
when Scott decided to withdraw
from the university.

Next week the RtP will look
at the SABU complaints against
the university and what pro-
gress has been made following
the actions of the last few
weeks.

“Virginia Woolf” review
(Continued from Page 2)

The realistic set design by Jim
Jones was well done and very
suitable for the production. The
great depth of the stage allowed
the freedom of blocking that is
vital to Virginia Woolf.

With this great succes under
its belt, the University Theatre
will move on to a production of
Bertolt Brecht’s Three Pneny
Opera. This play is in many re-
spects even more difficult to stage
than Virginia Woolf. But if di-
rector John Ellis can capture even
a bit of the professionalism of
the present production, he will do
quite well.

referee in the groin.

All this confusion may seem
very amusing or even bewilering
to the observer who does not
frequent such affairs, but for the
W&L wrestlers the meet brought
nothing but frustration. Coach
Franke went to Charlottesville
with hopes of placing some of his
wrestlers among the best in the
state, and of course, to give them
some good experience. No doubt
the team did gain experience, but
except for Jim Crytzer who placed
fourth in the 158 lbs. class, no
one else even won a match. If
they were not pinned, the Gen-
erals at least spent a great deal
of time on their backs counting
the lights on the ceiling.

“Of course I thought Jim
Crytzer and Ed Rogers should
have done a little better,’ com-

mented coach Franke. “But the
best wrestlers in the state were
here and at the very least we
gained some good experience.”
Still, how is it that the Generals
did not meet his expectations?
“Well, I think it was a combina-
tion of things,” Franke responded.
“Besides having to wrestle against
the best in the state, we were
a little flat, and we did not
wrestle as well as we could have.
We are a better team than that.”
On the whole, coach Franke
did not sound too upset about
the meet, perhaps because it had
no effect on the ODAC which he
still expects to win. Nevertheless
the Generals will have to re-
cover their balance and begin the
climbb ack up to the peak which
they had so recently achieved.

Dunlay also throws the discus
but that category is led by senior
Hank Phillips. Hansen on Phillips:
“Hank did a lot of work in the
off-season and is starting this year
10 lbs. heavier. He should set a

lips also holds 3rd place in the
state in the 35 lb. weight.

Other weight men_ include
senior John X. Miller, who com-
petes in the shot and discus;
and freshman Jamie Ryan, who
now throws the shot 40’ and could
possibly throw it 45’ by the end
of the season, according to Han-
sen.

Track is a tough sport in that
it demands much of a participant

is an individual sport in whieh
the man cannot depend on his

By LEE HOWARD

The Executive Committee voted
Monday night not to exclude
seniors from participating in the
“big three” elections until student
views on the subject are gauged
in a referendum before the stu-
dent body on its own initiative.

On a vote of 8-2, the E.C. de-
cided not to act on a proposal
made by Paul Larkin that seniors
he disenfranchised in the upeom-
ing elections for student body
president, vice-president and sec-
retary.

Che Ring-ton Whi

Washington and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper

Larkin said he made the pro-
posal because it is fairest that
the people who are going to be
affected by an election are the
ones who vote. “The idea of
student government is self-gov-
ernment. Seniors neutralize the
voles of the people remaining,”
he said.

Jim Koch, a member of the
audience, argued that “seniors
know the system” and “seniors
set the people out to vote.”

Larkin replied that just be-
cause one has been here for 4

Employment news

Job hunting

By BOB CHIAVIELLO

As of late October there was
a 6.89 per cent unemployment
rate among 1976 graduates of
W&L, according to a report com-
piled by Mike Cappeto, director of
the placement office.

According to Cappeto, the un-
employment figure does not take
into account those people who are
not looking for jobs.

A more important problem fae-
ing the W&L graduate was under-
employment. Underemployment is
described as a job where the
grad’s degree was unnecessary for
the type of work he was doing.

Almost 40 per cent of the job-
holding graduates were laboring
among the ranks of the under-
employed. Cappeto could not offer
an explanation for the situation
other than that it was sympto-
matic of the nationwide employ-
ment problem.

When asked how W&L stood in
relation to liberal arts colleges
with similar academic standards
Cappeto said that the situation
was about the same.

He pointed out that one prob-
lem in comparing schools is that
no two schools report their data
in the same way. He added that
employers are not really interest-
ed in what college a man gradu-
ates from.

Cappeto urged that because of
today’s tight job market it is im-
portant for students to start look-
ing early, preferably in their
junior year. He said that the three
things an employer is looking for
are proven administrative, com-
municative and interpersonnel
ability, and the GPA is one of
the last things a perspective em-
ployer looks at.

Cappeto also added that em-
ployers are not all thyt interested
in what a students major was, but
would be impressed with work
experience.

Cappeto urged all interested
students to make an appointment
with him to talk — — -_—

lans and possibly lay groun
ail for the future. The Office of
Career Counseling and Placement
is on the first floor of the Stu-
dent Center,

VEC services

To help young Virginians
searching for a job, the Virginia
Employment Commission will
again publish “College Profiles, ’
a list of recent college graduates
which is distributed to many Vir-
ginia employers.

To be issued in March, April
and May, the list will carry the
student’s name, home address, col-
lege attended and major and
minor courses of study. Employ-
ers who are interested in a par-
ticular student may contact him
directly or arrange an interview
through a local VEC office.

Seniors or recent graduates who
want to be included on the list
should see their college place-
ment officer or visit their local
VEC office to pick up “College
Profiles” registration forms.

These forms, which have been
revised since last year, must be
completed, signed and returned
to the VEC. No charge is made to
applicants or employers for this
or any other VEC service.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, FEBRUARY 10, 1977

Seniors keep right to vote
in “Big Three” elections

years “doesn’t necessarily mean
you know more about the system
or the people in the system.”

Trip Wornom, another member
of the audience, wondered
whether senior class _ interests
were really any different than the
rest of the student body’s. Rick
Goddard, a law school E.C. mem-
ber, picked up on the theme.
He asked whether there had been
a history at Washington and Lee
of senior class interests being so
radically different from the other
classes’ that they would conspire
to back a senior class candidate.
When no one answered he said,
“if the system works, why change
ne”

After further discussion, God-
dard moved that the E.C. take no
action on Larkin’s proposal “un-
til such time as the results of a
referendum showing student
views on the subject are pre-
sented to this committee.”

Larkin noted that a vote for
Goddard’s motion would be a
vote against the E.C. itself sub-
mitting a referendum before the
student body. Any referendum
would have to come from a stu-
dent-initiated petition which re-
quires at least 150 signatures.

Goddard said, “The issue does
not seem important. It hasn’t gen-
erated any cries of disenfranchise
seniors.” He was referring to the
lack of vocal support for Larkin’s
proposal and to the presence of
only about 20 people in the audi-
ence.

In other action the E.C. voted
unanimously to send flowers to
Mrs. Betty Jean Mohler, a sec-
retary who helped type up the
transcripts of the private honor
trial held recently. The tran-
scripts were never used as ihe
student decided to withdraw
rather than have a public honor
trial.

W&L debaters

By NED McDONNELL

The English accents rang out.
The two debaters from Edinburgh
University used a skillful combi-
nation of humor and hard facts
to disintegrate the argument put
forth by their two Washington and
Lee opponents, Walt Kelly and
John Rosen. Jeremy Hayes, a
philosophy major from London,
and Allan Drummond, a lawyer on
a grant at Edinburgh, successfully
persuaded the audience that
America should have a democracy
and not the W&L proposal of a
changing corporate oligarchy.

The debate centered around the
question: Should America have
a government as good as its
people? The W&L duo unsuccess-
fully tried proposing that the U.S.
should have an oligarchy con-
sisting of three or four corporate
presidents to be elected annually
by the presidents of the top five
hundred corporations in Fortune
Magazine, with civil liberties en-
sured by the Supreme Court.

The surprise strategy didn’t
work. The two Englishmen, evi
dently unphased by the rationale
of Kelly and Rosen, used facts,
quotations, and ethnic and _ po-
litical jokes to solidly rebut the
arguments of the W&L pair.

Kelly and Rosen reasoned that
if a government is to be as good
as its people, it ought to be
equivalent to them. Therefore,
they argued that Americans
should have an efficient and
profitable government which
scrupulously guards their civil
liberties. They rationalized that
Americans do not deserve a de-
mocracy given their low electoral
turnout.

Hayes closed the debate by
driving home the realization that
the oligarchy proposed by his
W&L counterparts would be ir
revocable, that democracy, while
not perfect, is the best form of
government, and that an oligarchy
would breed unstable and violen!
politics.

Details for the next debate, such
as place, time, subject, ete. have
not yet been arranged.

Mime troupe teaching

By DOUG DEWING

Three members of the Warsaw
Chamber Opera Mime Company
are teaching drama at Washing
ton and Lee this term

The Mime Company, which
toured the United States last year,
performed at W&L in October
Its form of mime is different from
that popularized by Marcel
Marceau. The Warsaw group's is
» combination of ballet, dance,
music and pantomine

Lee Kahn, assistant fine arts
professor and director of the Uni
versity Theatre, said this form of
mime is a type of body language
in which the actor uses his body

athletically to tell the story and
to build his character.”

“It's a first cousin to ballet,”
he said

The three will teach students
the use of various theatrical styles
and will direct them in applying
those styles.

The course, dramatic styles in
practice, is an advanced acting
class.

The Warsaw group's seven-week
teaching visit to W&L is spon
sored by the Glasgow Endowment

Graham Glasgow “to promote Ux

Complaints explored

By HALE DELAVAN

On Jan. 19, 1977 some twenty
members of the Student Associa
tion for Black Unity came to Dean
of Students Lewis John’s office
to complain about the recent
Honor Trial of Junior Raynard
Scott. The previous night they also
decided to bring up other griev
ances that, according to SABU
president Mike Brooks, had been
pending since 1971. They were
referred to President R. E. R
Huntley and remained in his office
until 8 pm. While there, they
presented two major complaints
which they had concerning the
University’s attitude towards
them. The complaints were: 1) the
lack of black faculty 2) the lack
of reerultment co-ordination

The Ringtum Phi researched
these complaints and went to the
\dministration to find out what
it had to say. In answer to the
first issue coneerning the lack of

black faculty, Huntley said that
the University has made “sincere
efforts to make jt clear to po
tential applicant) for faculty posi
tons that black candidates would
be welcome. The University ha
talked with applicants and has

ade offers of facully positions to
blac! md it continues to do so

lluntley added that thus for there

were three major reasons for the
failure to attract black professors
The first is that there is a large
demand for such persons around
the country. The second is that
the number of blacks that are
qualified is small and that the de
mand is high. He elaborated on
this point saying that the services
and the abilities of such people
are being sought by non-educy
tional institutions to a greater dk
gree than are the services o!
whites, Therefore, many blacks
leave their teaching positions, A)!
in all, “The supply is low, and the
demand is high.” He also felt that
Washington and Lee would be jn
a better position to attract black
faculty once it has some. “The
fact that there are none make;
it dificult to get any.”, Huntle:
said

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, February 10, 1977

Answers

This may go down in Ring-tum Phi history as the “all-
letters” issue, even though there are only two of them. Both
are long, and both represent extended and thoughtful con-
sideration of the issues dealt with in this column, This is the
kind of response I've been looking for all year. I'm sorry that
it took an ugly and unfortunate incident to get this sort ol
reaction, Read the letters before this column.

In reply to Mr. Cantler: Honor is not the only issue, It
never is, Of tantamount importance are the principles of
liberty. It is entrely possible that a student be both guilty
of an honor violation and, at the same time, the victim of
improper or unfair treatment. Neither guilt nor innocence
has any effect on his right to a fair trial. The cries of “Pro-
cedure!” and “Discrimination!” came from individuals who
care about preserving the rights of a free man, rights which
are at least as deserving of our “jealous protection” as your
precious honor,

To Mr. Rose (with apologies for not being able to print
your entire letter): While the quality of the television pro-
duction of Roots is questionable, the importance of the book
at least is probably great, and it indeed could have been used
as a springboard for a discussion of racial issues.

Washington and Lee has always seemed exceptional to
me in the extremism of its attitudes and characteristics. In
terms of race relations, the University appears as extremely
white, extremely traditional, extremly conservative, and e€x-
tremely Southern (in terms of shared beliefs, not geography ).
Integration came to W&L extremely late. Blacks form an
extreme minority. The barriers which separate blacks and
whites seem somehow more formidable here than elsewhere,
at least among students.

If these barriers are indeed more formidable, then they
require greater effort to be overcome, Dialogues between black
and white students, whether formal or informal, must be
the result of mutual effort. The need for interaction and
intercommunication between white and black students is
desperate ; the will to achieve these goals must be strong.

And speaking of extremes...

Violence

_., the psychological pressure upon students at WAL, must
he immense. Why else would a group of mostly conservative,
upper middle class young gentlemen turn into a pack of de-
structive lunatics every weekend?

Violence at W&L is nothing new. Why, we beat up 4
bunch of Wahoos with sticks every Spring. | myself have
seen, during the course of a supposedly festive oceasion, a)
unsuspecting student suddenly hurled to the floor, where two
or three others proceed to jump on top of him, Perhaps none
of this seeems very serious.

Yet I have heard several recent reports of incidents which
appear to point up another kind of violence. These involve
malicious dstruction of private property and even assault,

Why these incidents of violence in a peaceful acadeniic

day? Are we able to behave like “civilized” men most of the
time only by reverting to animal form over the weekend?
There is a fundamental imbalance,

At the very least one must be prepared to assume full legal
responsibility for any destruction of property or injury to
have caused, More helpful still

would be a thorough examination of the motives
such acts.

Letters To The Editor...

Right for the

Dear Sir:

There are, in this world, few
things I find more annoying than
to hear someone take a position
with which I wholeheartedly con-
cur, and then defend it for the
very worst reasons. I am afraid
that such has been the case in
last week’s editorial.

That the dispensation of honor
trials be delegated to an autonom-
ous body for which such matters
should be the sole concern, I
would be the last to take issue.
The present structure of student
government here provides more
than enough for E.C. members to
do. In fact, I think it most likely
that many might find consider-
able relief in not having their al-
ready cluttered days and nights
encumbered by the Burdens of
honor trials.

But, both you, Mr. Editor, and

the Student Association for Black

Unity, have missed the point, and
you have missed the point in a
manner signal of the decline and
fall of the honor system at this
university. To read page thirteen
of the present catalogue, one must
surely conclude that Camelot
lives, and the university regularly
enrolls almost seventeen hundred
Knights of the Round Table. We
are none of us so foolish (I hope)
as to imagine that such a thing
is true. Possessions simply are not
always right where he forgo!
them, and the word of a W&L
student is not always respected,
even within the institution. The
honor system is not what it was,
even Camelot fades, but undeni-
ably, we at Washington and Lee
enjoy a measure of trust and free-
dom not available in the vast ma-
jority of this nation’s places of
higher education. The fact that
anyone may wander through the
stacks of the library, that the
Co-op is not equipped with para-
bolic anti-shoplifting mirrors, and
that we actually may schedule our
exams at our convenience, are
rights well worth some thought,
and some jealous protection.

I say jealous protection, because
unless the students, not admini-
stration, faculty, or staff. or even
the risen spirit of General Lee,
are having a constant and ongoing
love affair with honor, this sys-
tem must surely fail. You, Mr.
Editor, and you, members of
S.A.B.U, but not you alone, are
in love, not with honor, but the
trappings of a penal system that
has nothing to do with honor.

Any society makes a choice as
regards honor; will it, or will it
not tolerate the presence of the

wrong reason

dishonorable in its midst. At
Washington and Lee, the choice
not to was made some time ago,
and it is known as the absolute
penalty. Anything less, any gradu-
ated penalty, any second chance,
is tantamount to an admission that
we will tolerate a lack of honor.
The rules of the E.C. as regards
an honor trial exists then with
one, and quite properly only one,
purpose, to determine whether or
not the individual on trial had
made a decision to conduct him-
self with out honor. Any other
concern with procedure, rules,
and regulations, is not only ir-
relevent, but patently dangerous
to the survial of honor here. The
answer is an honor trial is not
always clear or easy, but the ques-
tion is eternal and simple, and
it must be the only question for
the system to work.

It would be a mistake to think
that 1 am an apologist for the
E.c. 1 have as little use for
mosi of its members as | have for
our thirty-seventh U.S. President,
and convincing me of their tend-
ency to bend their own rules to
suiih their purposes would be
ease itself. Again, however, the
only question here is whether or
not a student has committed an
honor violation. If a student is of
the opinion that irregular means
were used to convict him of some-
thing he knows he did not do,
he has the option of public appeal,
where irregularitiesm ay be sub-
jected to the scrutiny of all his
peers. But if a student is guilty,
that is, all there is to it, and he
should and must leave.

I have heard no one protest
Raynard Scott's innocence. I can-
not pass judgement, I do not have
the evidence. If he has done
nothing, let this come to light, and
I will do everything in my power
to support him, for the dismissal
of an innocent man is less toler-
able to me than no honor system
at all. If the E.C. has conducted
itself without honor, perhaps the
parties aware of this should initi-
ate honor proceedings against
these offenders. But, if Mr. Scott
has done what was less than hon-
orable, let us not ery “Procedure!”
or “Diserimination!” Let us live
here, Mr. Editor, members of
$.A.B.U., and all others pleased
to call themselves Washington and
Lee students, for the truth, not
for the channels created to find
it. and sometimes perverted to
hide it.

Respectfully,
Win. D. Cantler "77

 

Ariel in need
Sir:

As Editor of the 1976-77 Ariel,
I think it is time to bring at
tention to a small problem that
is presently hindering the speedy
and efficient production of this
year’s literaray mgazine: lack of
interest. But | am not yet ready
to accuse the student body of
apathy—perhaps the problem is
timidity, in which case | have
some words for the potential, yet
hesitant, contributor.

First of all, try not to be awed
by what you may consider a
haughty and elitist publication.
The Ariel is an equal opportunity
magazine, which means that all
submitted works will be judged
with impartiality (English majors
get no special treatment), And
rest assured, | am speaking not
only for myself, but for the rest
of the staff as well.

in addition, | ask all of you
io consider the exciting prospect
of being a contributor to the
Ariel, and having your name ap-
pear for all the University to see.
Few things in life can equal the
thrill of seeing one’s name in
print, and thereby being vaulted
into the spotlight of distinction
among one’s peers. Did you miss
seeing your name on the Honor
Roll/Dean’s List posted outside
Payne Hall? If so, then here's your
chance to join an even more
eminent group. Before I continue,
let me emphasize one point: the
Ariel, despite this grass roots
appeal for contributions, will not
compromise its principles in order
to fill pages. As | mentioned
earlier, this magazine recognizes
no hierarchy among contributors;
however, the submitted materia!
itself will certainly be judged
with a justly eritical eye.

Finally, let me remind all fresh
men that they have a reputation
to live up to. The Ringtum Phi

reported, a couple of weeks ago,
that the members of the class of
1980 consider themselves better
than average artists and writers.
i am overjoyed to hear it. With
over 400 freshmen at W&L I
should be swamped with artwork,
photographs, short stories, and
poetry. Lam not. But there is still
time, and I am currenily braced
for a flood of contributions which
will enable me to compile a
representative collection of this
school’s creativity.

Respectfully yours,

Ryland Owen, ‘78

Editor, Ariel

Executive incompetence
Sir:

Would the mistakes made on
the part of the Executive Com-
mittee during the recent honor
hearing have occurred if a white
student had been involved?

This is a hard question to an-
swer and probably will never be.
However, several points should be
made. The “White Book” states,
“The accused student must be in-
formed of his status with a brief
description of the offense involved
at least three hours before the
hearing is to begin.

If, as had been suggested by the
defendant, this right of the ae
eused was not met, what would
have been the proper remedy’
Certainly, double jeopardy was
not!

The errors were those of the
Executive Committee and should
have been dealt with in a just
manner. Since recent events prove
that the E.C. is fallible. there
should be explicit avenues for re
dress of such errors and they
should not include double jeop
ardy.

Another matter that must be
confronted (whether or aot the
rights of the accused had heen

Interoffice memo to the editor-
in-chief from the managing editor:

You spoke too soon in your
weekly epistle from Sinai, or
wherever it is you sit to pen
your editorial madness. Wednes-
day morning I manged to find two
more letters in the usual places
that we find these things. Since
one of them fit into the theme
of the week, 1 went ahead and
passed it to the linotype, which is
even now sputtering and com-
plaining as it immortalizes the
golden words in lead. The alchemy
of print is wonderful, is it not?
Maybe you should write an edi-
torial about it as soon as you finish
the one on apathy at the football
games.

The second letter does not, re-
evettably, deal with race or honor
trials. It gets harder every week
to sustain an issue around here.

But I’m sure we have some sort of
obligation to our brothers in the
other fields of printed endeavor.
Maybe the letter could lead to
yet a second apathy editorial.

One last note. I figured out why

it was bolted to a steel desk.

responsible. Look closely enough

‘Roots’ and rotation

Dear sir:

_..1 do not know exactly what
“the SABU complaints against the
university” are, but that a certain
degree of racism exists on campus
seems unquestionable. As a fresh-
man last fall, I watched SABU
protest from my dorm window
and my fellow freshmen make
such comments as “get the white
sheets.” Comments of the same
nature—but not quite the same
tone—have been heard more re-
cently. All of this seems a bit
ironical in view of the public
reaction to the publication of and
television presentation of Alex
Haley's book, Roots. Both serve to
give the nation’s white population
a better understanding of the
black experience in America,
though the book succeeds in this
better than the television pro-
duction.

Each night “Roots” was pre-
sented on television, the TV room
in the student center was a bit
more crowded. The book and the
television production may leave
an impact on members of the
W&L community, as it will on
people across the nation, but it
seems that the impact at W&L
eould have been greater. More
then once I have wondered how
members of the black community
felt as they watched or read
Roots, and I was a bit surprised
that no one—either black or
white—tried to organize some in-
formal discussions about Roots.
In view of the recent problems
here, such discussion could have
proved beneficial. Organized by a
aualified person (a faculty mem-
ber, for example, or a group such
as SABU), the discussion could
have brought the experience of
Roots from a cultural or social
level to a personal one, and could
have eventually come around to
a discussion of the standing of
blacks at W&L. Such discussions
could provide a better understand.
ing between the black and white
communities, and could be quite
beneficial for SABU in particular.
Working through the student body
in such a way could lead to a
stronger voice and perhaps quick-
er changes, and certainly more
lasting changes.

... The proposal to create a
separate body to deal with honor
violations is an interesting one

and has great merit, but there
are two things about it that are
disturbing. One is the matter of
secrecy and the other concerns
the way in which the proposed
system is set up.

A few people I have talked to
seem to feel that the honor sys-
tem at W&L is at the hands of
fraternities. How widespread this
feeling is | am not certain, but
at times this seems to have merit.
I have heard of one ease in the
past where a student was found
guilty in a trial before the E.C.
and requested a public trial. At-
tempts were made to dissuade
him from asking for a public trial
and certain E.C. tactics hampered
his attempts to formulate his de-
fense. Yet he was acquitted in
the public trial but found the
atmosphere such that he could not
complete his education at W&L.
Thus it seems essential that one
address the problem of keeping
power out of the hands of a few
powerful groups in order to pro-
tect minority rights as one pro-
poses a new system. Also it brings
into question the merits of the
secrecy surrounding honor trials.

I do not think the “rotating
membership” proposal in the last
Ring-tum Phi is a good one. It does
not address the questions raised
above, and it seems to open the
system to more problems of the
type present in the Raynard Scott
case. Where students serve just
once, personal prejudices are
likely to come to the forefront
more often. Such a system would
have less responsibility than the
present one.

A better suggestion may be—
using the analogy to the U.S.—
treating each fraternity and the
indepentents as separate states
and allowing each fraternity and
the independents representation
on the court proportional to their
sive in the student body, with
a two-thirds vote needed to con-
viet. The representative would be
elected by their constituents, with
the understanding that any honor
trial of a court member be a
public trial. This, too, has its
problems. But the idea of separat-
ing the E.C. from honor trials is
a good one, and | hope that it is
pursued further.

Sincerely,
Ken Rose

Rugby team
gets ready

Although their cute little shorts
may not be much in evidence
in the following weeks, members
of W&L’s Rugby Club are pre-
paring to take to the practice
fie'd to tune up for their spring
season. The Ring-tum Phi recently
talked to the club’s coach, Jeff
Muck, about the club’s prospects
~-he was optimistic.

The major cause for optimism
is the appearance, from various
sources, of new talent. The fresh-
man ¢lass has supplied Chip Sisk
and Duncan Lowe, both of whom
have played aggressively and well
in forward positions, as well as
Al Fernandez, who showed po-
tential in the high-pressure full-
hack spot during the short fall
season. The law school contributes
its share of newcomers with Bill
Seidel, who brings impressive
credentials with four years of ex-
perience from West Virginia
Weslevan, and Bob Basco, who,
while his field ability is as yet
untried, has distinguished him-
self in traditional post-game
pursuits.

But the best of the club’s new
members come from Lexington.
Holding down fly-half will be Phil
Clayton, who brings nine years
of experience to that position.
Clayton will tour New Zealand
this summer with his home club,
San Francisco RFC. A second Lex-
ingtonian, Rick Norris, has six
years of playing to his credit.

Fluck anticipates few personnel
changes in the scrum, that group
of players who mob the ball and
its unlucky carrier in order to
regain possession of the ball. Re-
turning serum veterans include
Chris Johnson, Warren Wolfe,
ieorge Triplett, Tony Cuicci, Paul
Harris, Chuck Alt, and Dave
Hemenway, as well as Sisk and
Lowe. The unit has the potential
to be a powerful serum, but its
line-out expertise is suspect due
to a lack of tall jumpers.

The pivotal positions of crum-
half and fly-half will probably go
to Sal Abbruzzese and Phil Clay-
ton. Abbruzzese, while not the
flashiest kicker or quickest scrum-
half in Virginia union, is a strong,
steady player who specializes in
wearing down his opposite num-
ber.

A large number of players are
qualified to fill the remaining
back positions. Norris, David
Hamra, Bob Basco, and Jim Bar-
nett are likely choices for the
heavy contact positions of inside
and outside centres. A number of
good players are also available
for the wing three-quarter and
fullback slots: Bev Mauck, Bill
Frear, Ed Johnson, Angelo San-
telli, Al Fernandez, Bill Seidel,
Tommy Turner, and Rock Joyner.

LETTERS TO THE EOLTOR

(Continued on page 2)
violated) is the resultant leakage
in this case. The “White Book”
declares, “if the suspected stu-
dent faces the charges, is found
guilty, and withdraws from the
University without requesting a
Student Body Hearing, his record
shall only state that he with drew
from the University.... All such
information is considered highly
confidential.”

Here again, the Executive Com-
mittee seems to be in direct viola-
tion of the “White Book.”

The only conclusion that may
be drawn is that if these “mis
haps” would have occurred with
a white student, then the E.C. was
not bigoted, just incompetent.

I-M competition:
bowling, ping pong

By MICKEY KNAPP

As the varsity wrestling and
basketball teams continue their
successful seasons, the Intramural
program rolls on behind the
scenes. Bowling is in its regular
season phase, and ping pong is
now entering playoff competition.
This year’s wrestling program,
under a new tournament format,
will be held next week.

I-M bowling, which is played
each Tuesday afternoon at the
Lexington bowling alley, is being
dominated once again by Zeta
Beta Tau. Lead by Rick Lovegrove,
ZBT is undefeated to date and
should complete its regular sea-
son with a perfect record. Defend-
ing champions Phi Kappa Psi,
featuring last year’s MVP Chuck
Clow, have also been tough so far
with the exception of a rather
resounding loss to powerful ZBT.
Regular season competition will
continue through the month of
February with the playoffs to
begin in March.

Lambda Chi Alpha appears to
be the team to beat in I-M ping
pong. They have been champions
for two years running, and would
very much like to make it three.
Jim Lawson and Dave Davis are
the stars of this year’s squad. One
team does appear to have a chance
of knocking off Lambda Chi. Pi
Kappa Alpha, which retains its
overall lead in the total point
standings, is lead by Jim Fisher.
PIKA also completed its regular
season undefeated, and could very
well defeat Lambda Chi in the
playoffs.

under an entirely new format this
year. In previous years, the sea-
son had consisted of dual meet
competition concluded by a play-
off system similar to that of the
other sports. This year, however,
the program is to be conducted
under a tournament format on
Monday, Tuesday and Thursday of
next week. The competition is
sure to be intense, particularly in
view of the new I-M rule that al-
lows former lettermen to com-
pete.

With five sports completed,
PiKA maintains a strong lead in
the overall point race for the
1-M championship trophy. Sigma
Chi is second, Phi Psi third, and
the Phi Delts fourth.

Generals back in swim

The W&L swimming Generals,
now 52 and idle since a 67-46
setback at the hands of William
and Mary on January 29th, will
take the pool again this Friday
when they host Virginia Com-
monwealth beginning at 7:00 p.m.

W&L had a scheduled meet
with Morris Harvey College of
Chraleston, W.Va. last Saturday,
but the meet was postponed due
to the energy crisis. With the
concellation of that meet, all of
W&L’s 1976-77 dual meets are
now against NCAA Division I or
I! opponents.

The meet with VCU is the Gen-
erals next to the last2 home
meet of the season. They host
Old Dominion University on
Saturday the 19th.

three more games

According to the latest NCAA
release, the Generals are now the
nation’s 11th ranked Division JU
hasketball team, and that was
prior to this last week’s action,
where W&L claimed three vic-
tories.

In addition to national recogni-
tion in the poll, W&L’s winning
margin of 15.4 ppg is in the top
five, as is the team’s free throw
percentage of .764, and their won-
loss percentage of .895. That won-
loss percentage could be the best
Division Ul mark in the nation
when the next release comes out.

The teams’ three latest vic-
tories upped the Generals record
to 17-2, the best start ever for a
W&L hoop team, and-brought the
count-down to the “Magie 20” to
three games. If W&L can win
three of their next seven games,
ine “7677 Gens would become
only the third team in the history
of W&L basketball to win 20.
Should the team win four or more
of those seven games, the team
would find themselves alone in
the W&L record book as the
winningest team in the school’s
71-year basketball history.

Head Coach Verne Canfield,
now in his 13th season in Lex-
ington needs only three more wins
to give him 200 coilegiate career
coaching victories. Canfield is by
far and away the winningest coach
in the University’s history.

Diy. II poll and should provide
W&L with their most formidable
opposition thus far. Macon is 13-4
overall, and currently leads the
series 14-11.

Saturday the Generals travel to
Maryville, Tennessee to play the
Seo.s, the first of three con-
secutive road games for W&L. The
team is not home again until the
ODAC Tournament on February
226th. Incidentally, the win
over EMC assured W&L of no
worse than a first place tie in the
conference. They can wrap it up
by defeating Bridgewater on the
read on February 19th.

second place;

“finest performance” of year

Coach Gary Franke called it,
“The team’s finest performance all
season.” In what would have to be
termed their most successful out-
ing of 1976-77, the General grap-
plers finished in second place in
the nine team Pembroke State
Brave Invitational last Saturday.
Host Pembroke (N.C.) took top
honors with 154% points followed
by W&L with 112 3/4 and Camp-
bell College with 88 3/4.

W&L’s only individual champ-
ion was 142 lb. Ray Cross, a fresh-
man from Nazareth, Pa. In going
3-0 on the day, Gross won three
decisions by a total of 22-6. Nine
of the ten W&L representatives
placed in the tournament. Second
place finishers included Ed Rogers
at 150, Captains Jim Crytzer at
158, Todd Wohler at 167, and
Tom Oxendine at 177.

Boyd Breeding took third at 118,
Dan Kniffen finished fourth in the
heavyweight calss, and Howdy
Knipp (126) and Bill Cole (190)
finished fifth. Crytzer, a senior
from Mt. Vernon, Va., needs only
one more individual victory to
become W&L’s all time leading
match winner.

Earlier in the week, the grap-
plers bested V.C.U. 36-12 to run
their dual match record to 7-3.
The Cenerals remain in first place
at 3-0 in the ODAC.

W&L has two dual matches
scheduled this weekend, Friday
against Catawba in Salisbury,
N.C. and Saturday at Davidson
College. If the grapplers can win
both macthes, they would assure
themselves of their best overall
record since 1972-73.

Little sisters thriving at ZBT

The ABC store in Lexington,
according to the common wisdom,
has more volume sales than any
other store in the state. But an
equal record is undoubtedly set
by the University Supply Store’s
sales of Playboy, Penthouse, and
the like. The monosexual en-
vironment of Washington and Lee
is distrubing to many and annoy-
ing to most, but yes, Virginia,
there is an island of sanity in this
sea of frustration. At the Zeta
Beta Tau house, the Sisters Pro-
vram with Southern Seminary
College has been nothing less
than a stunning success.

The Sisters Program began in
‘areh 1976, with a proposal to

exand the female population at
the ZBT house. (The national
organization has approved of and
encouraged Sisters Programs for
years.) The first rush party was
held at the end of March, and
by Spring Term, the Sisters Pro-
gram was thriving.

The Sisters have their own
separate organization, with an

elected president, vice-president,
secretary, treasurer, and social
chairperson. The present officers
are President Delene Holloway,
Vice-President Lee Ann Vazquez,
Seertary-Trasurer Debbie Wirtes,
nd Social Chairperson Kitten
Bond.

rhe Sisters are initiated into the
fraternity along with the brothers.
They pay social dues of $35 per
year, and plan their own social
ealendar. Their activities for this
school year have included fund-
raising, a slave auction, a sca-
venger hunt, a pledge raid on
VMI, a Christmas party, and a
planned camping trip for the en-
tire house.

An important difference be-
tween ZBT and the other houses
is that the Sisters are co-equals
with the brothers. Above all, they
are net the traditional submissive
species so common to W&L. They
have their own room at the house,

and can—and often do—bring
their own dates to al! social
affairs.

Many Sisters report that the
program has aroused a great deal
of interest at Southern Sem, and
also a good deal of resentment.
As one Sister said, “Now that all
the excitement’s worn off for the
freshmen, they sit around most of
the time with nothing to do.
The Sisters are the only ones with
a place to go, with something
to do al Ithe time.” The President
of Southern Sem, Dr. Kanipe, has
even given official written sane-
tion to the program, in response
to a pledge scavenger hunt re-
quest.

For many of the Sisters, the
program eliminates the artificial
and superficial relations that are
caused by a monosexual environ-
ment similar to W&L’s. “We're
no longer treated like cattle;
there’s no massive round-ups for
dates like at other houses. We're
treated as genuine persons in our

own right — something that’s
rarely found anywhere else,” re-
ported a new member. Most

Sisters cited similar reasons as

Little action has been taken

and SABU never sees or hears of
them except by chance.” Coach
William McHenry was asked by
the Phi what he had to say about
that. He replied that the Athletic
Depariment has made efforts to
co-ordinate recruiting efforts of
black students with black athletes
on campus. He said he had a list
of black students that have been
contacted. Copies of that list were
sent to Dean of Admissions James

said, “My disappointment is that
we have not had enough interest

have contacted. We have contact-
ed 15 and thus far, only three
have applied this year.”

White Book. One of Goddard’s
proposals is changing the wording
to give an accused student at least
24 hours warning in writing be-
fore an honor trial can be held.

Students must be given three
hours notice the way the White
Book stands now.

Goddard wanted the EC to take
up his amendment proposals at
Monday night’s EC meeting, but
it was pointed out that the stu-
dent body constitution requires
the EC to put up a notice in Payne
Hall and the law school before
discussing proposals to amend the
White Book.

But he said that changes in the
White Book “can’t be made piece-

meeting somtime in the future to
discuss nothing but a restructur-
ing of the White Book.

Walt Kelly said he has things he
would like to change in the White
Book. However, he did not see
why the EC should call a special
meeting to discuss the changes.

A motion that the EC post a
notice that “substantive and pro

Book will be discussed at the next
regular meeting of the EC passed
unanimously. That meeting will be

Law women
present demands

by BOB CHIAVIELLO

An “Affirmative Action Pro-
posal” relating to treatment of
women students at the W&L Law
School was submitted Monday to
the faculty and administration.

The propasal by the Women
Law Students’ Organization (WL
SO) calls for the admission of all
women applicants with a 3.0 GPA
and 600 LSAT score, the release of
all admissions information on
WLSO applicants, the hiring of an
assistant dean for the recruit-
ment of women, and the hiring of
more women faculty members. So
far the administration has taken
no action.

Patricia Thursland, president of
the WLSO, said that the recent
mixer sponsored by the Student
sar Association was “the straw
that broke the camel’s back.”

Kate Schlech, who resigned
from the SBA social committee in
protest, said that she had been
fighting the use of SBA funds for
mixers back in the fal!. She said
ine “social committee gave us a
lot of back jazz so we took it to
the SBA, who wouldn’t take a
stand.”

The WLSO objects to the use of
SBA funds for activities that cat-
er to only a limited number of stu
dents. They said that 50% of the
law students are either married or

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Changes

News of the plans of the [:xecutive Committee to initiate
discussion of possible White Book revisions comes as a pleas-

ant surprise. This heartwarming display of responsibility and
accountablity flies in the face of the widely-held attitude on
campus (at least | take it to be such) which maintains that
any revision in the Honor Code constitutes a compromising of

honor at Washington and Lee.

This could hardly be the E.C.’s intention. More probably,
their primary aim is to make the “trappings” of honor as sim-
ple, as sensible, and as fair as possible. This appears to be the
thrust of the proposal that an accused student be given written
notice 24 hours in advance of his trial. A reasonable sugges-
tion. Other proposals offered by E.C. members also seem to
have as their goal the improvement of a somewhat flawed

document.

The most critical revision now under study, and the one
most likely to stir controversy, has to do with the absolute
penalty. Many students consider this to be the heart of the
code, and any attempt to reduce the penalty for certain types of
violations will meet with stiff opposition, I for one cannot re-

is the duty of the ELC.

\ one-year suspension with the option of re-enrolling has
been suggested as an alternative. | see little merit in this par-
ticular proposal. If it is true that virtually no one would come
hack after a year (imagine the suspended student, head shaved,
dressed in a hair robe, absorbed in pentitent meditation for the
duration of his exile), then why make the change? And of
course it will be argued that a convicted student has no right

to come back at all.

One other problem remains in the aftermath of the “Ray

nard Seott case”.

that of information leakage in private honor

trials. The E..C. may consider some form of penalty for persons
found guilty of releasing such confidential material, Shades
of Daniel Ellsburg. The issue is further compounded by the
possibility that such a leak could originate with a member of
the E.C. itself; the accused, his friends, and witnesses at the

trial are also suspect in such cases. This problem must be ex-
amined with particular care. What happens to the student who
reveals “classified” information as an act of conscience?

REVIEW and OUTLOOK The Rin

For the next several weeks, it
will be the purpose of this article
to inform and entertain the W&L
public with the detailed results of
a recent personal and confidential
poll (taken of a representative
sample of students at area wo-
man’s schools.

Unlike earlier polls of this na-
ture, these results were obtained
and handled as by other profes-
sional surveys, giving a greater de-
gree of legitimacy to the final
tabulations. These results will be
separated categorically and pre-
sented for average and extreme
results, including some sample re-
sponses. So, stay tuned weekly to
the Ring-tum Phi poll for some in-
teresting and often helpful infor-
mation with some humorous side-

lights.

“Three-Penny Opera”:
what is ths thing?

The Threepenny Opera, when it
opened in Berlin in 1928, was im-
mediately hailed as one of the
great plays of the new century. A
reworking by Bertolt Brecht of
John Gay’s Beggar’s Opera, it ran
for five years in Berlin—and then
for over six years in New York
(1954-61), setting an unprecedent-
ed record for an off-Broadway pro-
duction.

Basically, it is the story of the
events which led to the downfall
of Maecbeath, the infamous theif of
1837 London. This character, bet-
ter known in translation as Mack
the Knife, was originally portray-
ed in the Berlin production by
Harald Paulsen of operatic fame.
Vain as any stereotyped opera
star, he held out for a “big stage
entrance”: a song, to establish his
character of Macbeath. Out of all
this came the famous “Ballad of
Mack the Knife”, one of this cen-
tury’s true musical standards.
Created in collaboration with Kurt
Weill, the song is a moritat, or
chant which is sung at public
places, detailing the exploits of
famous murderers; a classic prolo-
gue to a great show,

Senior drama major John Ellis
has concocted a rather unusual
thesis project concerning this
show. He is simply coordinating
the efforts of a company of poor
« tors, who are going to present
Threepenny because they under
stand its appeal to “poverty's
plight.” And, as one of them said,
“It gives us a warm place to stay,
and money for ciragettes and liq
vor.” Ellis has been accused, per
haps justly, of laziness in bringing
a readymade troupe of actors to
W&L, but the inspiration he felt
upon seeing their performance
was to intense to pass up.

Traveling to Peru, Indiana, to
see the company's production, El-
lis, though pleased with their per
formance, was shocked to see the
company’s only horse die on stage
during the finale, Despite this tra

gic ending, our man in Peru re-
mained convinced, and signed the
contract.

Mr. F'lis comments: “It’s really
marvelous. They push this huge
wagon onstage and transform it
into a set.’ When asked for the
names of the prin ipal actors
Ellis claimed that they were to be
withheld as privileged informa-
tion—but guaranteed that the
horse will appear.

Production dates for the show
are Monday. Feb. 28-—Saturday,
March 5 at 8 p.m. in the Trouba-
dour Theatre. “That is, if the
thetare manages to raise enough
eash each night,” said Ellis. “I
have been warned that this bunch
won't go on stage unless paid be-
fore each curtain.” Nevertheless,
a nearly hysterical drama depart:
ment is offering tickets at a new
low price: FREE (this includes
eoat check and bathroom privi
leges), a8 long as you are a mem-
ber of our little college commun
ity and call 463-9111, ext. 371,
starting Monday.

One final word about these
overations: stepping outside of my
objectivity for one moment, I
must say that I have fundamental
doubts about Mr. Ellis’ show. The
question is: Is he flogging a dead
horse? And what about the com
pany? Will they find cash and
happiness (even if Vepeo refuses
to supply warmth)? Will Prof.
Kahn turn the Troub back into a
livery stable or barn after this hits
the boards? And what about Tri
pod” For the answer to these and
other questions, I can only tell you
to go and see Brecht and Weill’s
Threepenny Opera, coming up
soon—-you may even recognize a
few “familiar faces” in the crowd

onstage...

firmatively to the question: “Are
you presently dating any one in-
dividual?” Therefore, it would
seem that only a narrow 37% of
the MBC student body remain for
those exciting blind dates.

Following up on these subjects
that were dating one individual, a
few questions about this lucky guy
were asked. In response to the
question: “where does he attend
school or work,” a variety of an-
swers were found with no specific
tendencies. As expected, the W&L
gentlemen were well represented
being the most often mentioned,
followed by VMI, Hampden-Syd-
ney, and a scattered assortment of
other colleges and jobs, from
Madison College students to jani-
tors at U. Va.

When asked, “how long have
you dated,” the range came down
to from one month to 5% years
with ro special tendencies. The
average length of steady dating
came down to about eleven
months. ;

As for the question of who is

dominant in the relationship a
full 42% felt that the male was,
36% felt that there was and equal
relationship, and the remainder
felt that they were the dominant
ones. How do you feel?

Finally, I got into the area that
I know you all are wondering
about—SEX! When asked, “have
you had sex together,” referring
specifically to their steady, over
47% answered “yes.” (about 3%
were not sure), For these that ad
mitted having had sex with their
boy friends I asked, “At what
point in your relationship did you
first have sex together?” You ab-
solutely would not believe what
has been going on right here un-
der our noses. You know all those
stories about your buddy meeting
a girl, dating her a few times, and
then making the big score—forget
them. Somebody has committed a
grave honor violation. The range
for elapsed time before actually
hopping into bed was, catch this,
from one month to three years.

3.5 for 32 in 48...
Two-star Final

by J. G. FITZGERALD

Does anyone out there remem-
ber this column? We introduced it
last Winter and spent half the
term convincing people it was not
the title of a Chicago song. The
title referred to Mock Convention,
a process whereby a majority of
the student body spent 3.5 years
planning to spend 32 thousand
dollars in 48 hours.

The title was grossly inaccurate.
The MC actually spent $38 thous-
and inst of 32. The convention
itself took up about 30 hours—
including rack time—instead of
48. We were right about the three
and a half years of planning
though. Even now a registered
elite is sitting on the top floor of
the Student Center figuring out
how to go about second-guessing
the Republican party in 1980.

I got quite a bit of hassle about
the phrase “second-guessing”’
when I used it in reference to the
Mock Convention last year. The
chairman of the Massachusetts
delegation in particular, a mem-
ber of the PIKA house, took ex-
ception to my referring to the pro-
cess as second-guessing the party
out of power. He said they were
actully “predicting” what the De-
mocrats would do last summer.

Mr .Webster, the writer of lexi-
‘cons, not the frosh E.C. rep. last
year, said that (def. 2a.) second-
guess means to predict. In which
case the MC did a good job of

seecond-guessing the Demo party.
It may not seem relevant now that
we have a new president, but it is
still enlightening to look at how
well the last MC at W&L foretold
what the July “real-world” con-
vention would do.

Just after the Ohio primary, the
one that many observers said put
Jimmy Carter over the top in his
party, George Wallace endorsed
the present president. The second
ballot at the W&L convention
started off with the Alabama/
Wallace delegation going to Car-
ter. The late Mayor Richard Daly
came out for Carter about the
same time as Wallace. Illinois was
one of those states that put Carter
in the winner’s circle in Lexington
last spring. In fact, the entire se-
cond ballot at the last Mock Con-
vention was, as the W&L Alumni
Magazine noted in one issue, a
mirror-image of what would hap-
pen later in the real world, be-
tween the time of the last three
piimaries and the convention.

Some people may wonder why
we are finally getting around to
reporting how well the 1976 Wash-
ington and Lee Mock Democratic
Convention did its job. It comes to
mind at this point in time because
Monday night is when the MC,
with the help of the E.C., finally
closed its 1976 books and made
the 1980 effort the affair of the
hour.

Letter To The Editor

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:
Sir:

In response to the letter from
Tony Carli in last week’s edition
of the Phi, I would like to make
the following observations. Mr.
Carli seems to believe it to be a
recognized fact that the E.C. erred
in some way with respect to the
case of Raynard Seott. However,
I am not aware that any of the
charges made by SABU or others
concerning procedural irregular
ties have been proved. I would re-
mind Mr. Carli that the E.C. has
not answered the charges and
Suggest that perhaps he has heard
only one side of the story. But for
this state of affairs, I must blame
the E.C. By refusing to answer the
allegations of procedural viola.
tions, the E.C. gives the impres
sion to Mr, Carli and others that
it indeed is guilty as charged. I
would hope that this it not the
case. If it is, the student body has
a right to know. If these charges
are not answered, rumors will per-
sist and horror stories of the E.C.'s
wrath will be passed on. This is
not the ideal environment for an
honor system.

Concerning Mr. Carli’s second
charge against the E.C., 1 would
only point out that the E.C. has
been very closed-mouth about the
entire case and as I have suggest.
ed, perhaps too closed-mouth. It
was the membership of SABU
which chose such dramatic mea
sures to bring the case of Mr.
Seott into the public lime-light
If the black students had not made
their charges concerning the case
part of their complaints made
known most effectively in the
President's office, I doubt that the
facts of the case would have been
made known to such Publications
as the Roanoke Times and the
Richmond Times-Dispatch as wel!

as several radio and television sta-
tions. While I do not deny the
right of Mr. Seott or any other
student to air any problems he
might have with the E.C.. he must
take the responsibility of any re-
sulting publicity of the case. The
E. C. is correct in its stand not to
release any facts concerning the
evidence surrounding the honor
violation. However, I believe that
it should answer the charges
whieh have been made by those
supporting Mr. Scott,

Sincerely,
Stephen Q. Giblin, ‘77

months. So, going on the assump-
tion that a guy meets a Mary Bald-
win girl in the fall, he probably
would have to wait for that magic
moment until the spring.

For the subjects who answered
negatively to the sex question I
asked, “why not?” Most of the
subjects refused to answer or pro-
bably could not. In any case one
subect did reply that the only rea-
son she had not was because her
boyfriend had not tried; he goes
to VMI. Another replied—“. . .
after six months of dating stead-
ily, but stopped because (we) felt
it was wrong. We both asked Jesus
into our life...”

In any case, it would seem that
the new liberated women of MBC
might not be as liberal with their
charms as thought or rumored. If
you have not met and dated one
yet, it would seem that you might
as well give up for this year and
wait until next fall, unless you ean
find one of the exceptions or you
a are looking for a “weekend
w e,” :

tion came before the E.C. from the
MC asking for about $700 from the
student body reserve fund to pay
debts left over from the 1976 con-
vention. $693.23, to be exact. Rep-
resenting the '76 MC we had Walt
Keiley, secretariat, now member
of the E.C., strangely silent about
left-over bills; Radar Davis, mem-
ber of the E.C. this year and last,
E.C, rep. to the MC last year, and
strangely silent about why the
E.C, did not keep an eye on the
MC last year and prevent these
overexpenditures; Rick Wolf,
Ring-tum Phi drama critic and MC
co-chairman in charge of facili-
ties, looking dignified (he seemed
to think so anyway) and not really
saying anything about last year’s
convention.

Somewhere between the two
conventions sat Jim Lawson. He

was an administrative assistant

for the '76 show, and is co-chair-
man with John Trump of the in-
terim planning for the 1980 ef-
fort.

Then on the other side we had
Trump. Trump sat in the hot-seat,
being questioned by the E.C.
about Ahe debts his predecessors
hed teft him, and looking like
nothing quite so much as John
Trump. Beside him, doing most of
the talking and taking most of the
flack from the E.C., sat Jim Me-
Nider, treasurer for the 1980 fes-
tivities, a very nervous individual
from all appearances, more an ac-
countant than an apologist for the
man who held the job before him.

We have never been afforded a
sight of the E.C., the SAB or any
other student committee in this
stale of flux, the old, the new and
ithe transition sitting in one room.
Given the sight, I for one was dis-
appointed. Nothing substantive
eame of the meeting. There was
no passing of the torch, only a
sharing of the blame. The new MC
people explained how the old ran
up massive debts in the last min-
utes of last Spring's deal.

The lovely and talented Joan
Grady, Miss Virginia, sang the na-
tional anthem at the opening ses-
sion, and wandered around on the
arm of a former E.C. member.
Keith Teel sang the song better at

Generals gain 19th win;
beat RMC in photo-finis

By BARBARA MINNIG

Last Wednesday, W&L basket-
ball fans discovered that they
don’t have to travel half a mile to
see the best basketball team in
Lexington. In what was billed as
the game of the year, W&L turn-
ed back a powerful Randolph-
Macon squad, 75-73, in a thriller
which matched two of the finest
small college teams in the state.
Coming into the game the Gen-
erals were 17-2 on the year and
ranked 7th in the nation in Divi-
sion III, while the Yellowjackets
were 14-4 and honorable mention

in Division . Instrumental in the
team’s victory was*the enthusias-
tic support of the largest, and
most boisterous crowd of the year.

From the beginning of the game
it was apparent that Randolph-
Macon would not blow W&L out
by 25 points as they had last year
in Ashland. Ardith Collins made
this explicit when he brought the
crowd to its feet with a break
away slam dunk early in the first
half. Dave Leunig and Bob Flint
played their usual consistently
fine games, taking the game to
Randolph-Macon’s two standout

Two-star final

(Continued from Page 2) :
the second session. Miss Virginia
cost over a hundred bucks. Teel
was free. The bill was left for the
1980 MC. President Huntley held a
reception the evening before the
convention. The bill was forward-
ed to the 1976 MC, from whence
it was forwarded to the 1980 com-
mittee.

There was more. There were
2000 copies of the "76 MC Journal
left over. Lumber from a local
building supply store and flowers
and flags from a national supplier
of decorations made the parade a
crowd-pleaser. And made the 1980
effort debt-ridden. After a half-
hour of debate Monday night the
E.C. voted to make good the debt
from their reserve fund, a fund
designed to pay for deficits in stu-
dent body budgets in any activity.
No torch was passed, they just
closed the books.

Meaning the books are now
open on the 1980 Washington and
Lee Mock Republican Convention.
So far they have $200 from the
student tax to work with. They
also have $10,000 from the Sum-
ners Foundation, the political sci-
ence study group in Texas that
gave 12 grand to the ’76 MC, an
amount roughly equivalent to the
entire budget for 1972. They were,
according to the treasurer for last
year’s event, speaking to the Phi
last year, supposed to have a few
thousand surplus from the previ-
ous convention.

A few thousand which may as
well be forgotten as we look for-
ward to the next convention. They

have their disadvantages. In 1976
the contacts and sources cultivat-
ed in the 1972 planning could be
used again. Next time we change
parties, and the information ma-
chine will have to start at ground
zero. But there is one of the ad-
vantages. Since the next one will
be a Republican convention and
this is, beyond a doubt, a Republi-
can student body, people in the
real world may talk a bit more
freely. It will be easier to pass a
platform, a task that was left un-
done in the middle of the night at
the ’'72 and "76 events. Of course
the effect of a Republican student
body works both ways: they may
have trouble being objective about
the whole deal.

John Trump, who will graduate
a year before the next convention,
outlined those pros and cons to a
reporter who will graduate two
years before the’deal comes down
in 1980. He outlined them after a
meeting with an Executive Com-
mittee, all of whose members, save
one, will graduate before the next
convention.

Somewhere out there is a fresh-
man who will take the reins for
the next MC and try to pick some-
one to run against Carter in 1980.
We hope he and his colleagues will
be as accurate as the 1976 crew—
they picked the right veep for the
first time in MC history—and will
leave a little more behind. I wish
him luck as we finally close the
books on the 1976 Washington and
Lee Mock Democratic Convention.
Like the man said, “The future is
in front of us.”

The W&L wrestlers ran their

season record to 10-3 with decisive
30-12 and 30-15 wins over David-
son and Catawba respectively this
past weekend.
. Several team members did ex-
ceptionally well, most notably cap-
tain Jim Crytzer, who set a school
record of 62 career victories with
two wins on the trip, surpassing
Doug Ford’s (75) mark of 61.

Also standing out were fresh-
man Boyd Breeding, who recorded
two victories by pins in the 118
weight class, and junior Howdy
Knipp who came back from a
hand injury to take dual wins in
in the 126 class. Freshman Todd
Wohler had successive triumphs
in the 167 division.

All did not go well for the Gen-
erals, however. As the team was
leaving for Catawba on Saturday
morning, it was discovered that
sophomore Tom Oxendine was
missing. A thorough search failed
to locate the absent wrestler, and
it was decided that the “lost
sheep” was to be left behind in
order to make the match in David-
son.

Filling the gap in the 177 weight
division for Oxendine was another
sophomore, Ed Rodgers. Ed did
not fare too well himself, as mid-
way through his match he severely
hurt his knee. (It was later dis-
covered ‘that, true to the W&L
spirit, Oxendine had been “study-
ing” a book, and failed to notice
the time).

“Overall it was a great showing
for the entire team,” said junior
Howdy Knipp, “it should give us
good momentum going into the
last part of the season.” The next
match for the matmen will be
away against Madison College on
Wednesday, Feb. 16. This match
will serve as a preparation for the
ODAC Tournament coming up
“eb. 23 at Doremus Gymnasium.

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

 

Mermen defeated
but Choppers win

by BOB LYFORD

The W&L aquamen took time
out from their rigorous training
for the Nationals to host defend-
ing state champion Virginia Com-
monwealth University in a specta-
cular home meet this past Friday.
W&L lost the meet, 58-55, but “it
was a great team effort against a
tough team,” according to one
team member.

In fact, three team members re-
corded their best times ever. Bob
Newcomb swam his best time in
the 50 yd. freestyle event in his
third place finish. Chip Hoke fin-
ished second in the .900 yd. free-
style event, and just missed quali-
fying for the Nationals as he main-
tained his finest pace in his sec-
ond place finish in the 500 free.
Also, Keith Romich set a school
record in his third-place finish in
the 200 yd. fly, while winning the
200 yd. freestyle event.

The lone double-winner was
John Hudson in both the 500 yd.
and 1000 yd. freestyle events.
Coach Stearns commented that
“the sprinters are beginning to
swim well.” Tad Van Leer finish-
ed second in the 50 yd. and 100

yd. freestyle events, also record-
ing excellent times. Drew Pills-
bury finished third in both the
200 I-M and the 200 backstroke
events, and Peter Meem came in
third in the 200 yd. backstroke.
Also, Gordon Ross took second in
both diving events.

Despite these superb individual
performances, it was perhaps the
famous “Chopper” relay which
generated the most excitement.
This relay, entirely composed of
members of the Lambda Chi Al-
pha fraternity—Chip Hoke, Bob
Newcomb, Scott Duff, and Keith
Romich—edged VCU in a close
contest and in the process quali-
fied for the Nationals. Chip Hoke
called the Chopper relay the “best
fraternity relay team in. the na-
tion.”

Thus, although Bill Greg satiri-
cally stated “we’re psyched for
missing Fancy Dress” in reference
to the state meet to be held that
weekend — his real sentiments
could be detected when he further
commented that “we're a small
team with big ideas.” So, W&L
will be carrying a good season
record into the State Meet.

Generals run close second
in first indoor track meet

by JERRY HARRIS

Let the word go out. The Wash-
ington and Lee track team will be
a force to reckon with in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference if
their performance Saturday is any
indicator. The Generals finished a
close second to Lynchburg while
easily outdistancing Davidson and
Roanoke in the first indoor track
meet of the season for W&L.

Traditionally, W&L has treated
the indoor season as a practice
ground for the outdoor season.
And as this approach might indi-
cate, the Generals usually don’t do
well in the indoor season. How-
ever, this year’s squad appears to
be one of W&L’s best as was illu-
strated in the Davidson meet.

Despite the absence of several
key performers, the Generals
scored 69 points, just behind Lyn-
chburg’s 74 point total. Davidson
and Roanoke were far behind with
35 and three points respectively.
Even though the score shows

‘otherwise, the squad members and

coaches looked upon it as a vie-
tory. Certainly, it was the best in-
itial indoor performance that
W&L has ever had and could
have been better if not for in-
juries.

Co-eaptain John Tucker spoke
for the team, saying, “We won it.

Thompson's times in the 880 are

both Scott and Burns are top fin-

W&L was swept in the long
jump and triple jump events while
managing only third place in two
other events but their balanced
strength in the sprints, weight
events and relays made up the dif-
ference. The Generals are now

tie for having the most ROTC
members. Of the student body,
60% are fraternity members.

An analysis of academic majors
of the cadet juniors and seniors
shows the Arts have 45% of these
cadets, the School of Commerce
40%, the Sciences 10% and the
Law School 5%. Business-account-
ing and history are tied for most
popular major among these ca-
dets. This compares with school-
wide statistics for the same two
years when academic majors in
commerce and history far surpass
the other disciplines.

And the ‘geographical back-
ground of the cadets also com-
pares with that of the University-
students at large. In descending
order, the following four states
provide the bulk of the W&L ca-
dets: Virginia, Maryland, New
York and Pennsylvania. The four
states providing the greatest num-
ber of students to Washington and
Lee, in descending order, are Vir-
ginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and
New York.

These statistics show that the
make-up of the cadet corps virtu-
ally mirrors that of the student
body. The cadets come from neith-
er the upper nor the lower end of
the SAT or GPA spectrum. The
Cadet Corps represents a healthy

Their academic majors, fraternity
membership and geographical

dent community.

cords were kept on how the ’76
convention was run.

Paul Larkin, senior EC repre-
sentative, pointed out that the
budget for the ’76 convention was
more than double the ’72 conven-
tion’s budget, yet the ’76 conven-
tion ended up with a deficit and
the ’72 convention had a $1,600
surplus.

The budget for ’72 was $18,000,
compared to the ’76 budget of
about $38,000, he said. He asked
why, given these statistics, the 76
convention could not stay within
its budget.

Rick Wolf, ’76 convention co-
chairman responded, ‘“The ’76 con-
vention was twice as good, twice
as accurate,” and in order to get
the quality they had to pay the
costs. McNider added that the ’72
convention had been given a sub-
stantial amount of money by the
Sumner Foundation after the con-
vention was over, turning a pro-
spective deficit into a surplus.

Radar Davis suggested that the
EC loan the °76 convention the
money until it could be payed
back from contributions. MeNider
said that wouldn't close the books

on ’76 which was what he was
there to do.

Stradtman said the most dis-
turbing part of the financial re-
port was the cost of the Mock Con-
vention Journal. Lawson acknowl-
edged that 2,000 extra copies of
the magazine were still around, as
well as a lot of ’76 Mock Conven-
tion stationary.

He said however, that the items
represented only about $1,000 out
of the total budget of $37,000, and
that other Mock Convention de-
cisions, such as the decision to
make Mock Convention T-shirts,
were profitable ones.

Finally, Neil Pontifallo moved
that the EC give the Mock Conven-
tion the $693.23 requested. The
motion passed, with only Larkin
and Davis dissenting.

In other action, Jacob Jones
presented two petitions to the
EC. One asks for a student refer-
endum to decide the question of
whether or not seniors should be
allowed to vote in the upcoming
“big three” elections for EC presi-
dent, vice president and secretary.

The other petition asks for a
referendum to decide whether or
not freshmen should have two rep-
resentatives on the EC.

quirement.

He has attended almost every
election and initiation since 1915,
and estimates that there are about
152 ODK chapters at colleges and
universities today. Although the
chapters tend to be concentrated
in the south and mid-west, the or-
ganization is growing (with an
average of two additional chapters
each year) into other areas of the
country, Latture said.

Latture has had a long and sue-

Lee—in fact, he has been a mem-

er than anyone else in the history
of the school. As an undergradu-

were scarce and poorly-paid: the
former was, to some degree, in-
fluenced by the latter). He also
served on the student Executive
Committee for two years.

In 1920 Latture joined the fac-
ulty and taught French for four
years before channeling his inter-
ests toward political sckence. He

Herman & Herd:
a sound of today

by JAY TAYLOR

His band plays tunes by John
Fogerty, Carole King, Frank Zap-
pa and Stanley Clarke. He cut an
album featuring blockbuster gui-
tarist Mike Bloomfield, who has
been associated with many major
rock artists including Dylan and
Stephen Stills. His band is young
and he is playing at Fancy Dress.

Who is this guy?

John Mayall? Erie Clapton? El-
vis? Al Black?

It's Woody Herman. And you
probably thought he still plays
“Laura,” with it’s dripping senti-
mentality and sauve saxaphones.
Not Woody. Not the Thundering
Herd.

If Herman sounds anything like
his records, and anything like
what the critics say about him, the
music is going to make disco
sound mighty thin. Herman and
the Thundering Herd have jn-
coroprated rock rhythms with the
musical idiom he grew up with,
the same music that most of rock
and roll emulates, the black blues.

Now this is beginning to sound
like a press release for the SAB.
But I was highly skeptical at the
first announcement of the Herman

show. “Another one of those,” I
thought. “Everybody trying to

act like Mom and Dad with this
dated crap.”

But after listening to a few
Herman cuts, I realized what the
man is trying to do. He has as-
sembled fine young musicians and
has given them “coaching” as he
puts it. In turn, they have con-
tributed rock culture and its live-
liness. Herman is too creative to
stagnate in any one sound.

This is the forty-first year that
Herman has been involved with
big bands. He started in 1936 with
the disbanded members of the Is-
ham Jones orchestra. While the

jazz scene was overfloiwng with
Benny Goodman-ish swing, Her-
man’s band played the blues, and
called itself ‘The Band That Plays
the Blues.” The band dissolved
during the war, and the Herman
Herds lineage began.

The First Herd had it’s biggest
hit with “Caledonia.” Igor Stra-
vinsky wrote “Ebony Concerto”
for the Herd. “The First Herd was
perhaps the most vital white jazz
band ever,” according to the Jazz
Book by Joachin Berendt.

Dave Tough drummed in that
First Herd, and is considered to
be on par with Gene Krupa. “He
helped pave the way for modern
drumming” according to the Jazz
Book.

When many people are trumpet-
ing the return of the big band
sound, Woody Herman has always
been here. He disdains the nostal-
gia craze though, in the music of
the forties. “I can hardly bear the
whole scene. It’s a great sadness

‘to see some of these people

who've been in retirement for
years, and they pump them up for
a minute and bring them back to
life for a minute.”

A press release describes Her-
man’s exerience with the blues.
“Ironically, young people today
seem to think they discovered the
Black man’s blues when actually
over thirty years ago Woody and
Jack Teagarden were the only two
whites accepted as true blues
singers along with such black ar-
tists as Big Bill Bronzy, Jimmy
Fushing, T-Bone Walker-and Lead-
belly.”

A SPE from Marquette Univer-

sity, Woody has said “I’ve always .

had a ‘sound’ but never a style.
My approach to the music I am
involved in always has been let it
be tasteful, let it be exciting, and
always let it swing.”

Good-bye old friend

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The University has taken a step. Whether forward or back-
ward, we're not quite sure,

Acting in the name of efficiency, economy, and progress,
the University has decided to reduce sharply the amount of
space and equipment alloted to the Journalism Laboratory
Press, otherwise known as the Print Shop. The immediate and
short-term effect of this action will be a significant reduction
in the capacity of the Print Shop for service to the University.
The long-term effects are difficult to predict.

“The University” in this case is represented by President
R.E.R. Huntley, his assistant Frank Parsons, Treasurer James
Whitehead, Publications Director Romulus Weatherman,
Dean of the College William Watt, News Information Direc-
tor Bob Keefe, and Journalism Department Head Ron Mac-
Donald, with an assist from Scheid Associates, a Pittsburgh-
based consulting firm which specializes in academic print
operations management.

Based partially on the Scheid study and partially on their
own observations and ideas, this University committee’s de-
cisions include: consolidation of Copy Center and Print Shop
operations into a “Printing Center” occupying two-thirds or
less of the space now occupied by the Print Shop alone ; elimi-
nation of the Shop's most advanced press; elimination of all
hot-type equipment (currently used for almost everything, in-
cluding the Ring-tum Phi, Shenandoah, \lumni Magazine,
and many others); “vendoring” of major printing jobs (in-
cluding the Ring-tum Phi, Shenandoah, Alumni Magazine,
and many others) to commercial printers outside the com-

have only a minor impact on the University community, while
admitting that people will be forced to adjust themselves to
some new ways of doing things. This may prove to be quite an
understatement. Without going into technical detail: the out-
moded hot-type equipment is being slowly replaced with
modern offset equipment. Unfortunately, there is not yet
enough offset equipment to handle all the work now done with
hot-type; a gap in the Shop's services is the inevitable result,
at least until the new set-up is more complete.

The victims of this reduction in services will be numerous ;
administrators; faculty, and students will all have to reckon
with the changes effected by the University decision, The
volume of work done by the Print Shop and Copy Center is
enormous ; few people realize the extent to which this Univer-
sity is dependent upon the countless reams of high-quality
printed material produced by these services. We never know
how much we have until we lose it.

The effects of this move will be felt most directly by the
Print Shop and Copy Center staffs, who were not consulted
about these decisions until after they were made. The printers
at the Shop are professional craftsmen who take great pride
in the quality of their award-winning work, While the Uni-
versity has promised that no jobs will be eliminated, they won-
der about the future of a Shop with but little work requiring
professional attention.

Not many universities operate full high-quality print shops
on campus. But then, not many are as special as Washington
and Lee. We can only note in sorrow the passing of one of

 

munity.

W&L’'s unique traditions.

The University takes the position that these changes will

WGL

Scenario: It's Friday night of Faney Dress
weekend in Doremus Gymnasium. The event
is the ODAC tournament which determines
what teams will go on to compete in the
NCAA regional playoffs. The host of the
tournament, conference leading Washington
and Lee, is on the floor against Bridgewater
in the opening game. The stands on the op-
ponents’ side are packed, There are 43 people
on W&L’'s side.

The picture painted above could become a
reality unless our students do something
about it. How many of you have plans to at-
tend the game Friday night? Too busy, huh?
That's right, | forgot. Got to start drinking
at 5.05 p.m. right after classes, No time to
take a breather and cheer on our team on
their way to the conference championship.
Haney Dress is tonight. The game can he
played without me there, right?

Sure it can. The other 16 home games have
heen. | guess around 9-pam, most of W&L
will be asking, “I wonder who won the game
ionight?” More than likely, the response will
he “Oh, | forgot there was a game.”

What is wrong with us, people? Our basket-
hall team is ranked 4th in the nation, and no
hody gives a damn, That means, of all the
hundreds of schools in. Division II only three
are better than we are! Attendance at home
vames wouldn't show it though, You'd think
we were in the bottom 10 instead of the top 10

it's not a fluke either, This team is the best
ever in. W&L history. It holds the longest
winning streak in the school’s history, \s of
Saturday, the 1976-77 team has won more
vames in one season than any other team,
hey have the best record in Division IIL and
are close to leading the Division in scoring
margin, free throw percentage, and scoring
average.

Phe Generals’ brand of basketball is exert
ing. Good ball control, excellent field goal
percentage, good defense and offense. The
team has its ball wizard (Mike Wenke), and
fiery shooter (Pat Dennis). Any other stu
dent hody would be busting their buttons w ith
pride at having a team like this. Too bad they
play at W&L. ;

Yes. here at W&L, we don’t have time tor
‘thleties too many conflicts, We can't go to
the games during the week because we are
too busy studying so we can party on the
weekend. We can't go to the games on the
weekend because we are too busy partying
\nother important excuse for not going te
WA&L always loses, “If ever W&I
tarted winning,” tell “the
crowds would pick up.” Who are we trymg

rillics
we ourselves,

Look at swimming. Year after year, W&!

pete in the Nationals Time after time we

you have

eran many of

Spirit?

How about football? After a lousy half sea-
son, the team started beating people they
shouldn't have. It loked as though we might
have our first non-losing season in a decade,
“Ho-hum,” was the reaction. The only game
that drew was the Homecoming game, and
that was because it was something to do be-
fore the grain party.

Where else, but at W&L, could the home
team be first-and-goal in their opponent's ter-
ritory and the fans act as though they were
about to punt?

Where else, but at W&L, could the Tlome-
coming dance be held on a Friday night so
the foothall players couldn't atend? Home-
coming is a celebration for the special oca-
sion when a group of people return to the
place they regard as home, So, | ask you, isn't
i. a bit odd to have a party when the guest of
honor can't be there? SAB co-chairman, John
ierley, remarked,” No one cares about foot-
hall. We'd still have a ‘homecoming’ even if
we didn't have a football team. It would just
he called something else.” We seem to have
misplaced our motives somewhere over the
years, don't you think?

Mayhe legitimate excuses exist for poor at-
iendance in the mentioned sports.
Swimming and similar sports are not what
vou would call “big” sports. The football team
hasn't been what it used to be, that’s for sure,
Hut, what is the excuse for basketball? None
exists. The b-ball Generals had 11
straight winning teams and still can’t draw
the crowds. Don't tell me the students here
aren't basketball fans. They must like basket-
hall enough to pay to see VMI play some of
the same teams W&L does.

The problem is, W&L doesn't mean the
same thing to us that it meant to the men be-
fore us. It seems as though we are enduring
this college experience, rather than enjoying
it. This is evidenced by the calibre of partying
carried on here, There is no unity here at
Wa&l. There are to many opposing factions ;
independent vs. frats; frats vs. frats; rock vs,
woul: athleties vs. scholasties. The sad thing
is, no one cares about anyone else, Everyone
for himself. In the system that now exists,
there are too many takers, and not enough
vivers. Whatever hapened to the close-knit

above

have

small college atmosphere?

\fter you graduate, what would you rather
remember about your colege experience how
many times you got drank, or the excitement
of coming together as a student body and
cheering your 4th-ranked basketball team on
to the national championship? You can get
drunk anytime, but how many chances will
vou get to be caught up in the crowd enthus

iasm and maybe see W&L go all the way? The

Generals have never done it before, and they
may never get the chance to do it again, This
is the first time in their 71-year history they
have been nationally ranked, and 4th at that!
It's too bad they haven't had our support

along the way,--up to now

Darrell plans changes
for Cockpit-game room

by BILL THOMSON

Gerald Darrell, manager of
Evans Dining Hall, was named
head manager of the Cockpit fol-
lowing the Feb. 11 death of Mar-
shall Sumner, who managed the
Cockpit for the last year and a
half. Darrell’s additional duties
are part of a Washington Hall-di-
rected move to consolidate the
food services in the Early-Field-
ing University Center. :

“I’m working closely with the
University Center Committee in
order to find out what the stu-
dents want to do with the Cock-
pit,” Darrell said. The University
Center Committee, with the help
of student suggestions, will con-
centrate on improving the effici-
ency and flexibility of the Cock-
pit and game room facilities. The
committee will hold an open meet-
ing in the Cockpit on Feb. 28 at
4:30 p.m. Darrell and Mike Cap-
peto, W&L placement director,
are the committee’s administra-
tion members; the student mem-
bers are Doug Jackson, Charles
Hulfish, Bob Chiaviello and Bill
Thomson.

“We have to find out things,”
said Darrell. “The Cockpit has
been more like a ‘nice Co-op’ than
a student rathskeller.” He said
that the Cockpit should have eith-
er a ‘club atmosphere’ or a ‘snack
bar atmosphere’—depending on
what the students prefer.

Ambassador opens exhibit

A bequest of reproductions of
selected works from the National
Museum of History of the Repub:
lie of China, Taipei, Taiwan, and
of paintings from the Art Society
of China, to W&L’s permanent art
collection will be on exhibit for
the first time in duPont Gallery
from March 1 through 25.

On display will be reproduc-
tions of Chinese bronzes, porce-
lains, ceramics, and prints of tra-
ditional brush paintings by an-
cient masters. Contemporary oil
paintings, watercolors, graphics,
and brush paintings, donated to
W&L by members of the Art Soc-
iety of China will also be exhibit-
ed at this time. The Gallery is
open Monday through Friday from
8 am to 5 p.m.; there is no ad-
mission charge.

His Excellency Dr. James C. H.
Shen, Ambassador of the Republic
of China, and Mrs. Shen will be
here March 1 at 8 p.m. to open
the exhibit to the general public,
and to officially present the set of
reproductions from the National
Museum to W&L. After the pre-
sentation, Dr. Shen will give a
brief talk in duPont auditorium.
A reception will immediately fol-
low.

The bequest of the reproduc-
tions is the result of a campaign
initiated last Spring to secure
them for W&L’s permanent col-
lection by I-Hsiung Ju, Artist-in-
Residence, and coordinator of the
East Asian Study Abroad Pro-
gram; Art in Taiwan. While in Tai-
wan last Spring, Professor Ju and
his W&L students participated in
several activities sponsored by the
National Museum, a center for the
learning of Chinese culture and
art. A close relationship develop-

this colection could prove univer-
sally beneficial to W&L: “As a
teacher of Oriental art and art his-
tory, of course, I need them for
my classes. And I believe that
other professors in language, his-
tory, religion, and philosophy of
our East Asian Program will also
find this collection very useful.”

Professor Ju and Mr. Ho appeal-
ed for financial aid to the Minister
of Education of Taipei, who grant-

-ed 170,000 New Taiwanese Dollars
(4,250 U.S. dollars) for materials,
plus labor, shipping expenses, and
insurance, so that the Museum
staff could produce a set of repli-
cas as a gift to W&L.

Taking the National Museum's
action as an example, members of
the Art Society of China voluntar-
ily contributed many of their own
works to form another part of
W&L’s permanent collection.

Professor Ju commented for
members of the Art Society, for
members of the Museum staff, and
for himself as well that “This oc-
casion is the prelude of a greater
understanding of Chinese culture;
in the future, there wil be more
valuable cultural activities to
come to our area, promoting East
Asian Studies, which are the step-
ping stones toward closer friend-
ship between the Chinese and
American peoples.”

The University Center Commit-
tee wil consider measures to deal
with several problems associated
with the Cockpit and the adjoin-

_ing game room: difficulty filling
large numbers of diverse orders
and the coresponding slow serv-
ice during busy periods; controll-
ing people who carry their own
alcholic beverages into the stu-
dent center; making sure that cus-
tomers pay for their meals; keep-
ing local teenagers out of the stu-
dent center; and allowing student
talent to perform in the Cockpit
more frequently.

Possible measures under con-
sideration by the committee are:

1. Thinning down the menu
“to five or six popular sand-
wiches” by eliminating items that
are slow sellers (baked potato,
etc.) so that orders will be less
complicated and service will be
more efficient. Customer tickets
will be collected for a week or two
in order to determine the most
popular items on the Cockpit
menu.

2. Hiring students in the work-
study program to “patrol” the stu-
dent center and game rom in or-
der to cut down on the amount of
illegal alcohol carried into the
building and the number of trou-
blesome teenagers in the building
(recent incidents: pool table flipp-
ed upside down, skateboarding in
the halls, Cockpit employee hit
with pool cue). Darrell said the al-
cohol problem was “serious” and
that the law has been “flagrantly
violated.” When the game room
first opened, students were hired
to keep trouble from starting
around the pinball machines.

3. Giving students who would
like to perform in the Cockpit the
opportunity to arrange perfor-
mance times and receive SAB
sound equipment. Darrell is “de-
finitely in favor of student enter-
tainment—there’s a lot of talent
that hasn’t been touched.”

4. Requiring payment when a
meal order is taken so that cus-
tomers do not walk away without
paying for their food .This pro-
cedure has already been adopted
at night (Cockpit employees often
find crumpled order tickets when
they are cleaning tables.

It is the nicest facility in Lex-
ington,” Darrell said. “We want to
make better use of the facilities.”

For those who are concerned
about possible changs in Ye Olde
Cockpit, Darrell has encouraging
words. “We are not going to turn
the Cockpit into a McDonald's,”
he said. “We want to do a profes-
sional job, an dto do this we have
to use the available systems to
best suit. the needs of the stu-
dents.”

Applications for editor and busi-
ness manager of all student publi-
cations are due soon. Contact Bill
Thomson for details. Open to all
students.

The Triumphs

After wins over Bridgewater
and UNC-Greensboro, the W&L
basketball Generals have some-
thing every collegiate athlete
dreams of—being able to say his
team is the best in school history.
The Generals outscored UNC-G
Wednesday night 101-94 and ham-
mered Bridgewater 103-96 Satur-
day.

W&L has now played 15 conse-
cutive games without a loss—a
school record, They are only the
third team in the 71-year history
of W&L basketball to win 20
games in a season and they are
the only club to earn 21 victories.
In addition to that impressive 21-
2 record, the Generals are the
number four team in the nation
in Division III while commanding
the best winning percentage in
the nation (.913).

The list of personal and team
superlatives could continue al-
most indefinitely but the point has
been made—this is the best bas-
ketball team in W&L’s history.
And they played the part well in
defeating UNC-G and Bridgewat-
er.

W&L had played the Greensboro
Spartans earlier this season in
Lexington, having no problems in
winning. The Generals had no
problems in the rematch, either,
even though it was played at
UNC-G. W&L utilized their of-
fense to near perfection in rack-
ing up 101 points but in the end
it was their checking defense that
held off a Spartans rally.

Pat Dennis led the W&L scoring
with a whopping 32 points, anoth-
er big night for the hot-shooting
junior from Baltimore, Maryland.
He received ample support from
senior Chris Larson who came off
the bench to pop in 25 markers.
As usual, seniors Bob Flint and
Don Berlin controlled the boards
while sophomore guard Mike
Wenke continued to dish out as-
sists at his record breaking pace.

The win over UNC-G marked
several milestones. It was W&L's
14th straight victory which tied a
school record. It also gave W&L a
20-victory season (only the third
team in the school’s history to
earn that honor) and Coach Verne
Canfield his 200th career coach-
ing victory.

Saturday night carked the cul-
mination of a successful season in

the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence as the Generals blasted con-
ference foe Bridgewater. The
homestanding Eagles were never
in it, falling behind by 11 points in
the first half and never catching
up.

Once again, the big gun for the
Generals was Pat Dennis who gar-
nered a season-high 33 points.
Dennis connected on 15 of 23
shots for a blistering field goal
percentage of 65 per cent. In fact,
the entire team shot well, con-
verting 48 per cent of their field
goal attempts.

While Dennis was providing the
bulk of the scoring, Bob Flint,
Don Berlin and Dave Leunig were
turning in a strong game on the
boards as well as scoring. Berlin
pumped in 17 points and pulled
off 10 rebounds. Both Flint and
Leunig grabbed 13 errent shots
while they scored 16 and 13 points
respectively.

The two victories increased the
Generals winning percentage, al-
ready the best in the nation. And

they stand a good chance of mov-
ing up a couple more notches in
the national poll. The last regular
season contest will be March 2
against Madison College. The
ODAC tournament will be held at
W&L this week to determine who
receives a regional berth.

The Challenge

Much has been said about the
Generals brilliant 21-2 record, na-
tional ranking and ODAC regular
season championship. But you
can throw all those records out
the window when the First An-
nual Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference Tournament is played this
week.

Washington and Lee won the
ODAC regular season title handi-
ly, compiling a near perfect 9-1
record. Ironically, the only loss
was at home to third place Ham-
pden-Sydney. Close behind the
Generals was Lynchburg College
at 82. H-S was third with a 7-3
mark while Bridgewater placed a
distant fourth with an unimpres-

sive record of 3-7.

Even though the Generals would
appear to be the superior team
in the conference, everybody
knows that tournament time has a
long history of upsets. However,
a couple of underlying factors
might give W&L an edge that
could lead them to the tourna-
ment championship.

Probably the most important in-
fluence is the location of the tour-
nament games—Doremus Gym-
nasium. In effect, the Generals
will hold a strong home court ad-
vantage, especially if the W&L
students show up in mass.

A second influence is the tour-
nament schedule. By virtue of its
regular season record, W&L has
been top-seeded which means they
will play Bridgewater at 7 p.m.
Friday. Bridgewater is the weak-
est of the tournament teams while
the 7 p.m. starting time avoids a
conflict with the Fancy Dress Ball
that night. Lynchburg _ plays
Hampden-Sydney Friday at 9 p.m.
with the two winners advancing

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

The Triumphs and the Challenge

to the championship game Satur-
day night.

The third influencing factor is
the Division III national regional
bid. If W&L lost in the tourna-
ment it might still receive an at-
large bid for the regionals but it
can not be counted on. However,
if W&L should win the tourna-
ment title it would automatically
become one of the four teams in
the regionals. Furthermore, two
tournament victories would give
W&L an added advantage—a very
strong possibility of hosting the
regionals within the friendly con-
fines of Doremus Gymnasium. In
summary, the combination of a
big crowd and two tournament
victories might give W&L a home
court advantage through the re-
gionals.

The fourth and final factor is
the superiority of W&L on paper
when compared to the other tour-
nament contestants. The Generals
have beaten Bridgewater twice
this year; both by large margins.
The Eagles are very young and in-

Winning ts the only thing he knows

by J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

What does the coach of the na-
tion’s 4th ranked Division II] team
have to say after W&L obtained
their 20th victory this season and
his 200th career victory? Not
much! At least not much about
himself.

Vern Canfield, for the 11 of 13
winning seasons he has been here,
has had very little to say about
himself. But ask him about his
team and he’ll talk your ear off.

“’'m extremely proud of this
team. They have played well this
year and their success is due to
their own efforts. All I do is teach
them to believe in themselves, and
believe in their fellow teammates.
My program emphasizes team-
work, and unless a young man is
willing to give 110% of himself
towards accomplishing that goal,
he can’t play for me.”

Canfield’s coaching colleagues
have given him much of the cred-
it for W&L’s successes, but he has
no personal accolades about him-
self. In fact, he rarely uses the
pronouns I, my, mine, or me, but
rather we, our, ours, and us. He
will take credit for one thing
though.

“We have a program here at
W&L that promotes winning,
which I only coordinate. The team
takes the credit for all our wins.
I am responsible for our losses.”

Maybe that is why the Generals
rarely lose. Canfield is the win-
ningest coach in W&L history and
also in this year’s Diviison II.
For his career, a 201-117 record
for a .632 percentage, and this
year a 21-2 record for a .913 per-
centage. No other basketball
coach at W&L has won over 100
games, and Canfield is also re-
sponsible for 2 out of the 3 sea-
sons a W&L team has finished
with 20 or more wins (the last was
1966-67). His teams have had 11
straight winning seasons.

About this year’s team: “I’ve
never had a team that I believed
in more, and not because they are
great basketball players, because
they're not. The kids on this team
are the kind of people who will be
successful in life. Each and every
one of them has good character,
personality, and intelligence. But
most important, the kids this year
are totally unselfish. They try to
make their teammates look good,
rather than themselves.

“It is true that I have pushed
them hard in parctice, more so
than past teams. That is because
they are good basketball players,
and 100% for them is 110% for
anyone else. However, the real
reason this team wins is because
it is made up of beautiful people
who care about one another.

Why doesn’t a man who obvious-
ly knows his basketball, and
knows it well, move on to “higher
ground”?

“The job here has many plusses.

me though, is that coaching at
W&L is a challenge. We don’t give
scholarships here, so we don’t
have any ‘blue chippers’ and con-
sequently I have to teach bas-
ketball rather than coach it.”

“All this means is that a special
type of man plays basketball at
W&L. I want a guy who comes out
to play because he enjoys it, not
because he is ‘bound for glory.’
My men play because they want
to. They could be doing other
things like partying, but they
chose to play basketball.”

Puting aside all the victories in
his career, all the school records
about to be broken, the high na-
tional recognition finally achiev-
ed, Vern Canfield stil lacks one
important element characteristic
of a winning sports program.

“Ever since I have been here,
the school has never had the kind
of support this type of program
needs. The support we have re-
ceived hasn’t been consistent. This
is true for all the sports here at
W&L.”

“If you are winning, everything
is ‘rah, rah’. If your team is having
a mediocre season, you can give
up all hopes for a good crowd
turnout for a home game.”

“A crowd can make a differ-
ence. Take this past Randolph-
Macon game. The fans helped us
win that ball game. The players
need the home fans support. Re-
member, they are supposed to be

playing for ‘the school’.”

“Students say they can’t make
the games because they have to
study. Well, the basketball players
have to study also, besides giving
up much of their social life dur-
ing the season. Why couldn’t some
of those students give up a por-
tion of their social life to watch
their team?”

“In the past, we have treid
cheerleaders, pep rallies, and free
beer as gimmicks to draw crowds
(not to mention always free ad-
mission). Now we have a team that
is on the verge of greatness, and
an average home game draws a
crowd of only 200 students. Yet,
when VMI plays Hampden-Sydney
in our gym and packs it, 200 W&L
students pay to see them beat H-S
by fewer points than when we
beat them here.”

“If I sound embittered, it’s just
because I’m fighting for my guys.
It is just not fair to the boys who
get out on that court and make a
name for this school to be ignored
by the school. The student body.
and the faculty, should be proud
of this group of guys. They should

give them some recognition every “

on the back and saying ‘Good job’.
But they don’t—and its a shame.”

two players, Reiley and Hayes, for
their scoring W&L shot well
against the Eagles in both meet-
ings while totally controlling the
boards. The same should take
place in the tournament unless
Bridgewater ‘utilizes a stall. But
the Generals pressure defense and
patient offense should be able to
handle the stall just as easily.
Winning the championship game
won't be so easy. W&L has beaten
Lynchburg twice this year but
both games were closely contest-
ed, The Hornets possess two out-
standing players in high-scoring
forward Jim Crawford and center
E. D. Schecterly. Both players
have performed well against W&L

team depth. Hampden-Sydney is
another club that has given the
Generals trouble. The Tigers beat
W&L by two points and lost on a
shot at the buzzer by Chris Larson.
The Tigers are tall while forward
Ed Tieran is a profilic scorer. As
Tieran goes, so goes H-S.
REPORTER’S PREDICTIONS:
The Generals wil easily defeat
Bridgewater with Bob Flint lead-
ing the way. The Eagles will not
stall but look for them to blow the
tempo down. In the other semi-
final game, I pick Lynchburg as
Crawford and Schecterly are bet-
ter than just Tieran. However,
Lynchburg has beaten H-S twice
and everybody knows it is hard to
beat a team three times. Look for
a close game. In the championship
tilt I tap W&L to slip by the Hor-
nets on team depth and, hopefully,
a large W&L crowd with the usual
vocal support that comes with it.
Look for Flint, Dennis and Leunig
to star. With those two victories,
the Generals should receive a re-
gional bid and the host court.

Trackers finish 2nd

W&L’'s indoor track and field
team ended their abbreviated dual

along with the host Hornets,
Bridgewater, EMC, Emory and

Field leader Phil Dunley finish-
ed in first in the 35 lb. weight

day, while the Generals entries in
the 440 and 880 relays also took
top honors. W&L has the potential
to capture the title in this Satur-

The Triumphs

After wins over Bridgewater
and UNC-Greensboro, the W&L
basketball Generals have some-
thing every collegiate athlete
dreams of—being able to say his
team is the best in school history.
The Generals outscored UNC-G
Wednesday night 101-94 and ham-
mered Bridgewater 103-96 Satur-
day.

W&L has now played 15 conse-
cutive games without a loss—a
school record, They are only the
third team in the 71-year history
of W&L basketball to win 20
games in a season and they are
the only club to earn 21 victories.
In addition to that impressive 21-
2 record, the Generals are the
number four team in the nation
in Division III while commanding
the best winning percentage in
the nation (.913).

The list of personal and team
superlatives could continue al-
most indefinitely but the point has
been made—this is the best bas-
ketball team in W&L’s history.
And they played the part well in
defeating UNC-G and Bridgewat-
er.

W&L had played the Greensboro
Spartans earlier this season in
Lexington, having no problems in
winning. The Generals had no
problems in the rematch, either,
even though it was played at
UNC-G. W&L utilized their of-
fense to near perfection in rack-
ing up 101 points but in the end
it was their checking defense that
held off a Spartans rally.

Pat Dennis led the W&L scoring
with a whopping 32 points, anoth-
er big night for the hot-shooting
junior from Baltimore, Maryland.
He received ample support from
senior Chris Larson who came off
the bench to pop in 25 markers.
As usual, seniors Bob Flint and
Don Berlin controlled the boards
while sophomore guard Mike
Wenke continued to dish out as-
sists at his record breaking pace.

The win over UNC-G marked
several milestones. It was W&L's
14th straight victory which tied a
school record. It also gave W&L a
20-victory season (only the third
team in the school’s history to
earn that honor) and Coach Verne
Canfield his 200th career coach-
ing victory.

Saturday night carked the cul-
mination of a successful season in

the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence as the Generals blasted con-
ference foe Bridgewater. The
homestanding Eagles were never
in it, falling behind by 11 points in
the first half and never catching
up.

Once again, the big gun for the
Generals was Pat Dennis who gar-
nered a season-high 33 points.
Dennis connected on 15 of 23
shots for a blistering field goal
percentage of 65 per cent. In fact,
the entire team shot well, con-
verting 48 per cent of their field
goal attempts.

While Dennis was providing the
bulk of the scoring, Bob Flint,
Don Berlin and Dave Leunig were
turning in a strong game on the
boards as well as scoring. Berlin
pumped in 17 points and pulled
off 10 rebounds. Both Flint and
Leunig grabbed 13 errent shots
while they scored 16 and 13 points
respectively.

The two victories increased the
Generals winning percentage, al-
ready the best in the nation. And

they stand a good chance of mov-
ing up a couple more notches in
the national poll. The last regular
season contest will be March 2
against Madison College. The
ODAC tournament will be held at
W&L this week to determine who
receives a regional berth.

The Challenge

Much has been said about the
Generals brilliant 21-2 record, na-
tional ranking and ODAC regular
season championship. But you
can throw all those records out
the window when the First An-
nual Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference Tournament is played this
week.

Washington and Lee won the
ODAC regular season title handi-
ly, compiling a near perfect 9-1
record. Ironically, the only loss
was at home to third place Ham-
pden-Sydney. Close behind the
Generals was Lynchburg College
at 82. H-S was third with a 7-3
mark while Bridgewater placed a
distant fourth with an unimpres-

sive record of 3-7.

Even though the Generals would
appear to be the superior team
in the conference, everybody
knows that tournament time has a
long history of upsets. However,
a couple of underlying factors
might give W&L an edge that
could lead them to the tourna-
ment championship.

Probably the most important in-
fluence is the location of the tour-
nament games—Doremus Gym-
nasium. In effect, the Generals
will hold a strong home court ad-
vantage, especially if the W&L
students show up in mass.

A second influence is the tour-
nament schedule. By virtue of its
regular season record, W&L has
been top-seeded which means they
will play Bridgewater at 7 p.m.
Friday. Bridgewater is the weak-
est of the tournament teams while
the 7 p.m. starting time avoids a
conflict with the Fancy Dress Ball
that night. Lynchburg _ plays
Hampden-Sydney Friday at 9 p.m.
with the two winners advancing

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

The Triumphs and the Challenge

to the championship game Satur-
day night.

The third influencing factor is
the Division III national regional
bid. If W&L lost in the tourna-
ment it might still receive an at-
large bid for the regionals but it
can not be counted on. However,
if W&L should win the tourna-
ment title it would automatically
become one of the four teams in
the regionals. Furthermore, two
tournament victories would give
W&L an added advantage—a very
strong possibility of hosting the
regionals within the friendly con-
fines of Doremus Gymnasium. In
summary, the combination of a
big crowd and two tournament
victories might give W&L a home
court advantage through the re-
gionals.

The fourth and final factor is
the superiority of W&L on paper
when compared to the other tour-
nament contestants. The Generals
have beaten Bridgewater twice
this year; both by large margins.
The Eagles are very young and in-

Winning ts the only thing he knows

by J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

What does the coach of the na-
tion’s 4th ranked Division II] team
have to say after W&L obtained
their 20th victory this season and
his 200th career victory? Not
much! At least not much about
himself.

Vern Canfield, for the 11 of 13
winning seasons he has been here,
has had very little to say about
himself. But ask him about his
team and he’ll talk your ear off.

“’'m extremely proud of this
team. They have played well this
year and their success is due to
their own efforts. All I do is teach
them to believe in themselves, and
believe in their fellow teammates.
My program emphasizes team-
work, and unless a young man is
willing to give 110% of himself
towards accomplishing that goal,
he can’t play for me.”

Canfield’s coaching colleagues
have given him much of the cred-
it for W&L’s successes, but he has
no personal accolades about him-
self. In fact, he rarely uses the
pronouns I, my, mine, or me, but
rather we, our, ours, and us. He
will take credit for one thing
though.

Jim Underhill will be president
and George Griffin will be vice-
president of the Executive Com-
mittee, and a run-off today will de-
termine who becomes next year’s
secretary.

Today's run-off will be between
Neil Pentifallo and Kevin Lamb.
Pentifallo was the leader in Mon-
day’s election with 310 votes to
Lamb’s 234 votes. Tom McCarthy
received 223 votes.

Underhill, who was unopposed
on the ballot, beat write-in candi-
date Joe Fitzgerald. Underhill had
424 votes, Fitzgerald 39 votes.

Griffin, also unopposed, out-
polled write-in candidate Howard
Rubel 375 votes to 77 votes.

The final results of the voting
on the three amendments on the
ballot were not available at press
time but the Ring-tum Phi has
learned that only the proposal to
disenfranchise seniors was failing
as of Monday’s voting.

The amendment was favored by
192 voters and opposed by 273.
The proposal to move freshman
elections ahead two weeks was
passing (279-190) as was the
amendment giving the E. C. the
power to remove a candidate from
the ballot for breaking E.C.-im-
posed campaign rules (202-190).

Although both amendments
were passing, neither had the two-
thirds majority needed for addi-
tion to the constitution.

There are six candidates for the

Armstrong suggests

Fancy Dress

by LEE HOWARD

To avoid crowding at Fancy
Dress, the Student Activities
Board should limit ticket sales to
one per W&L student and open
up more of the student center,
said Mike Armstrong, co-chairman
of the SAB, at Monday’s Executive
Committee meeting.

Armstrong suggested moving
the main entrance to Fancy Dress
to another door so that Fairfax
Lounge could be better utilized.
The library, EC room and game
room could also be used, he said.

The only problem with opening
up more rooms, he said, is that
Fancy Dress will be much more
expensive. It will mean that more
rooms will have to be decorated
and that the SAB will probably
want to have something going on
in every room, he said.

Armstrong said 3,500 persons
attended this year’s Fancy Dress
as opposed to 2,600 in 1976. This
year’s Fancy Dress made money,
he said, although he did not have

A question was raised by Jacob
Jones about a party the SAB put
on for its members during Fancy
Dress. Armstrong acknowledged
the party and said the SAB spent
about $80 on it. Jones moved that
the EC have some way to control
the party expenditures to avoid
abuse.

SAB members argued that they
worked very hard, devoting al-
most all their time during the
week previous to the ball working
on decorations. They also argued
that they were already entrusted
with a large amount of money—
thousands of dollars in fact—and
could certainly be entrusted with
$80. Jones’ motion was voted down
10-1.

Armstrong also announced at
the meeting that there will be not
one, but two “porn flicks” in the
spring.

He also said the SAB has about
$13,000 in total funds right now
and that the Springs Weekend is
the only big event remaining. The
original budget estimate for
Springs Weekend was $6,000.

W&L bids for federal grant;
Washington Hall keeps mum

by WILLIAM H, EDMISTEN

Washington and Lee has sent a
proposal to the National Science
Foundation requesting a $250,000
matching grant for a new comput-
er system and has declined to
make the proposal public.

The proposal calls for W&L to
purchase the computer and ter-
minals while the $250,000 NSF
grant would be used mostly to pay
operational personnel, computer
programmers and special consul-
tants, according to Assistant Dean
of the College Robert W. McAh-
ren, who sent the proposal to the
NSF.

The proposal includes plans for
a statistical package which could
be used by students in the natural
and social sciences. Simulation
programs would be developed for

by BOB RATHBUN

In a continuing effort to bring
the wholesome aspects of life to
the W&L student body, the Outing
Club will sponsor a series of out-
door programs in the spring.

Working with “Wilderness Chal.
lenge,” a Roanoke organization
based on the same principles as
“Outward Bound,” the club hopes
to enable the interested student to
take part in small group outdoor
learning experiences.

Possible programs include a
ropes and balance course, a two-
day rock climbing course, white
water canoeing and various camp
ing expeditions.

An organizational meeting to
gauge student response will be
held in duPont auditorium at 7:30
p.m. next Thursday. Warren Dav

Diversity wins over theme in Contact

JOHN BRUCH and TOM MURPHY —

CO-CHAIRMEN OF CONTACT
by DAVID W. TALLEY, JR.

R-tp: Why is there no theme this year?

Bruch: Primarily because of what Tom and J
have viewed from the past two years, and Tom's
three years, that the Contact programs have had a
theme. but it has been superficial. We saw Contact,
when we ran for the program last spring before the
EC. as a university lecture series and not so much a
symposium as it has been billed in the past Also, it
is the main means to bring prominent speakers from

various fields to the campus,

R-tp: Why are the speakers so spread out?

Murphy: We spread the program out from Janu
ary to April beeause we assumed that students, fac
ulty members, and local people will have more time
in ‘which threy can drop by and enjoy different
speakers, whereas before, you had so many people
coming together that it was difficult for us to enjoy
all the sources. We hope this will present a diver
sified program that will appeal te people at differ

ent times threughout the year

R-tp: How has the chapel closing affected the

program’
Bruch: Greatly

during the final week of classes
Murphy: Unfortunately

It was closed from Feb. 7 to
March 7, and that wiped out a whole month for us
which was prime time because another one of our
considerations was to try to get away from having
speakers or a speaker here during mid-term time or

this closing of the cha

pel has caused us to put more speakers in March,
we'll have three, and that is one of the things we
were trying to get away from. However. there wasn't

much choice except going to VMI or going to the
gym. We'll go to the gym for Bruce Jenner and per
haps for Tom Wolfe, but we feel it wouldn't be a
proper facility for the other speakers, so the chapel
closing did cause quite a bit of trouble

R-tp: Are your publicity problems worked out?

Murphy: We had a terrible publicity problem
In so far as organizing, it has been worked out. Bob
Keefe works with us very closely now and he's going

to release all the information through his office

fields, and | think a

people we agreed on to go after

and answer any questions.

Rick Stein, president of the Out-
ing Club, emphasized the neces-
sity for all interested students to
attend the meeting. “If we don’t
get a good turn out for the meet
ing we'll have to cancel the pro-
gram,” Stein said. “This guy won't
come back if nobody comes to the
meeting so we've only got one
chance to take advantage of this
opportunity.”

A fee for the programs will be
charged but Stein said he was not
sure what that would be. “It all
depends on how many people
want to participate and what they

want to do,” he said.

A white water canoe trip has
been tentatively scheduled for
April 29th through May 1. This ex-
pedition will combine W&L and
Hollins students. “This should be
our biggest event,” Stein said “and
it will be limited to a certain num
ber of participants.”

Besides discussing the “Wilder
ness Challenge” programs, anyone
interested in joining a turkey call
ing class to be held this spring by
Professor McDaniel can sign up.

New Outing Club officers will
also be elected at the March 17
meeting.

chology, Sociology and Politics.
But the NSF will decide on the
proposal no sooner than May 20,
according to McAhren.

Dean of the College William J.
Watt refused to allow the Ring-
tum Phi to view the twenty-page
grant request proposal but said
it will be public if approved by
the NSF. Last year a similar grant
request proposal for $300,000 was
rejected by the NSF.

Watt said secrecy prevents
other schools in competition for
the grant from knowing “what
your plans are.” When asked if
this was the main reason for sec-
recy he said “No.” The main rea-
son is that (the proposal) is a per-
sonal communication between
W&L and the National Science
Foundation, just like a letter.”

It is standard practice for
schools and the NSF to keep un-
successful grant requests secret,
according to Dr. E. F. Turner,
who will become Project Director
of the grant if it is approved by
the NSF and W&L.

McAhren said acceptance of
$250,000 from the federal agency
would not obligate the University
beyond matching the money at an
undisclosed ratio. He said Title 9
of the Amendment to the Higher
Education Act of 1972 forbids
schools with sex discrimination in
admission policies from accepting
grants. But MecAhren said histori-
cally single-sex schools are ex-
empt from that provision.

Dr. Turner said the type of com-
puter for the system has not been
selected and he knows of no other
sources of grants if the NSF pro-
posal is rejected.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The New Guard

The results of Monday's Big Three elections came as no
surprise, and as no disappointment either, Mr. Underhill and
Mr. Griffin have, during this past year, acted as voices for clear
thinking on an Executive Committee with a reputation for

muddled ~ histrionics.

1 wondered at first why Mr. Griffin had decided to run for
vice-president, instead of shooting for the presidency. Then |
reread Mr. Underhill’s comment about “enlarging the role of
the vice-president and jumped to the conclusion that some sort
of deal had been made belore the campaign began, Grifhn
agreeing to accept the number two post if Underhill promyised
to sweeten it with a littke more power, if they were elected. 1
hope neither of them lost any sleep on that account.

Even if this is true, it hardly matters. Underhill and Grifln
were not responsible for the fact that no one else filed petitions
to run for the “Big Two.” Splitting the offices between them
seemed the best way to insure capable and responsible leader-
ship in both, Neither could have foreseen the last-minute en-
wies of Joe Fitzgerald and Howard Rubel.

These two last-named individuals deserve some credit lor
entering the race at all. Whether or not they necessarily be-
lieved themselves better qualified than their opponents, Fitz
gerald and Rubel at least believed strongly enough in the worth
of their government to involve themselves directly in the demo-
cratic process. Where were all the others?

The secretarial race was hotly contested from the start, and
the final tally shows it: Pentifallo 310, Lamb 234, and McCarthy
223. How this result justifids a runofl between Pentifallo and
Lamb is beyond me, considering McCarthy's extremely close
finish and the gap between Pentifallo and the other two candi-
datee. Anyway today’s the day for that runoff.

The probable outcome of the secretarial race (barring «
substantial shift in support), coupled with the results of the
presidential and vice-presidential elections, will mean a new
guard which is virtually indistinguishable trom the old. “This is
not necessarily undesirable, yet a few new faces in student gov-
ernment are always welcome and can provide some perspectives
that may be lost in an otherwise stagnant and self-perpetuat-
ing system. Election for E.C. class representatives will be held
this Spring. Here is another opportunity (how many do you
want?) for concerned students to get involved. Let's hope that
there will be more interest in that election than in the last.

Letter Uo The Editor

Dear Sirs:

Our letter is in reply to your
“Fancy Thanks” editorial of
March 3. First let us say that we
did have a good time Friday night
in spite of the SAB.

However, the SAB could have
done much to improve the even-
ing. which we feel did not mea-
sure up to the 1976 version. The
most obvious problem is the long
delay in being admitted. It is ab-
surd to wait in line one hour and
fifteen minutes, as we did, to at-
tend a four and one-half hour
event. The wait would have been
unendurable if the weather had
been inclement.

There are several solutions to
the problem. One could limit tic-
ket sales to a reasonable number
and offer them on a first come,
first serve basis, with a person
only being able to purchase two
tickets at a time—his name being
taken for a future checklist. Al-
ternatively, ticket sales could be
limited to W&L students, faculty,
staff and alumni with the afore-
mentioned two ticket limit per
person.

At any rate, no tickets should
be sold at the door at all, Anybody
can purchase their tickets before-
hand. Surely, even alumni can
write the SAB for tickets if they
do not live near Lexington. Addi-
tionally, selling tickets at the door
creates a bottleneck, since making
change or writing checks certainly
takes more time than simply
stamping a ticket. We overheard
Mike Armstrong try to mollify a
disgruntled, long-waiting ball
voer, His excuse was that over one
hundred tickets had been sold at
the door. The solution to this
problem is plainly evident

To further alleviate the admit
tance problem, we would like te
suguest that the SAB originally
plan te have at least two entrances
to the ball open. The belated open
ing of a second entrance on Fri-
day night was the only thing that
managed to get the line moving at
all. Originally having two en
trances would shorten the line
from the beginning and avoid
hastily set up stop gap measures

As to the decorations being

lavish” (tt P. March 4), we can

only conclude that you are referr-
ing to the amount of money spent.
We would characterize the effect
created by these decorations as
disappointing. How so much
money could be spent on corru-
gated paper, a stroboscopic hat!
light, a plastic chandelier, a few
flags and some sequined signs is
beyond us. Paris is a city rich in
culture and diversity. Surely more
imaginative decorating themese
could have been presented. Per-
haps if the Fancy Dress theme
were announced earlier, studen'
suggestions for decorations could
be collected in a drop box in the
Co-op.

Our most important objection
concerning Friday night deals
with the SAB itself. We strongly
disagree with the practice of the
SAB feting itself at student ex-
penses. We suppose the argument
for the “lavish” buffet and bar
they give themselves is that they
work hard. Big deal. They took the
job voluntarily, and they knew all
of the work it would involve.
We're sure people could be found
to do a responsible job without
their requiring that an “appropria-
tion” of student funds for person-
al amusement be necessary for
them to accept a post on the SAB

Their thinking here is reminis
cent of the excesses of public ser-
vants in the real world outside the
colonnade. It's lamentable that at
a supposedly honorable institu-
tion this materialistic. pompous
greed should manifest itself in se
petty a fashion. The SAB is sup
posed to be serving the student
body, not vice versa.

We are proud that so many
people from all over the country
wish to attend our school's big
weekend. It can certainly be tak
en as a compliment to the efforts
of the SAB and the school low
ever, every institution can stand
improvement, and Faney Dress is
no exception. The SAB should
keep in mind that Faney Dress is
primarily for the students of
WAL, not the entire East Coast of
the United States

The Ring-tum PhiSurvey

This week’s survey returns us to
the innermost private world of the
Mary Baldwin student, examining
in particular her attitudes toward
sex, birth control, and drugs and
alcohol.

by GREG K. HALEY

Looking at the drinking habits
of Mary Baldwin students, we
found that less than 1 per cent
never drink alcoholic beverages,
34 per cent drink only seldom or
about twice-a-month, and 66 per
cent drink at least two or three
times a week. Twenty-seven per
cent said they drink “often,” at
least four days a week.

As for these drinkers getting
drunk, 38 per cent said definitely
never. Another 38 per cent oblig-
ed the idea that they occasionally
get drunk. Finally, a full 24 per
cent answered that they get in an
uncontrollable condition quite of-
ten when drinking.

The list of aleoholic beverages
selected for consumption is un-
limited. Bourbon was the most
mentioned beverage, followed
rather closely by rum, gin, vodka,
and beer. Almost all possibilities
were mentioned at least once or
twice, ranging from imported
scotches to banana daiquiris.

When asked, “Have you ever
smoked marijauna?”, 63 per cent
responded affirmatively. But
when asked, “Do you smoke regu-
larly, now?”, only 10 per cent an-
swered affirmatively. Of these
steady marijauna smokers, only
15 per cent answered that they did
so often,

A generally different area is the
actual purchasing of marijauna.
Even for the smokers, less than
25 per cent admitted having ever
made a purchase and less than 1
per cent admitted frequent pur-
chases. The rest mooched or only
participated when it was supplied
or offered. One subject that did
admit buying once, replied that it
was not for herself, but “for my
mother.”

In dealing with legalities, I ask-
ed, “Do you feel that National
Laws concerning marijauna are
fair?” A full 33 per cent felt that
they were actually fair enough.
Another 6 per cent felt that they
should be even stricter. Obviously,
the remainder believed the pre-
sent laws to be unfair and were
often very explicit about possible
changes—such as, telling the gov-
ernment to go ye forth and mul-
tiply, in net so many words.

Getting into the “heavier stuff,”
I asked the subjects, “Have you
ever tried any non-medical
drugs?” Only about 27 per cent
had, but this use was very limited.
often to only one or two experi-
ences. Of these, a full 100 per cent
had tried “speed” for studying or
dieting. Bevond this, there were
limited experiences of LSD and
cocaine, by less than 1 per cent of
the subjects.

Considering one final idea with
respect to these different drugs

(including marijauna) I asked, ‘Do
you object to others smoking pot
or taking drugs?” 60 per cent ad-
mitted to objecting to others
smoking pot around them now
with 98 per cent objecting to drug
experiences around them. So, the
drug scene is probably on the outs
for now, no matter what brand
you prefer.

Lastly, I want to get into sex
and birth control ... who doesn’t?
I asked the subjects, is sex. part of
your plans for “a perfect week-
end”. Only 20 per cent answered a
definite yes. 23 per cent answered
possibly. 10 per cent answered not
necesarily. A full 47 per cent an-

swered a definite “no.”

Going on, even with this minor
setback, | asked who they feel is
actually responsible for birth con-
trol. 53 per cent felt that both par-
ties are responsible, since both are
involved (usually). 40 per cent
felt that the woman is and 7 per
cent felt the man is.

Within this responsibility, less
than 30 per cent actually use or
have available for use any birth
control method, 27 per cent are
on the pill and les than 3 per cent
have an IUD. So, they seem to say
one thing, but practice another—
or don’t practice.

Dealing with a rather recent

controversial issue, I asked, “Do
you agree with abortions by con-
senting adults?” A full 97 per cent
replied “yes.” Of those, only 7 per
cent would ever consider having
an abortion, anly only 10 per cent
had ever actually had one.

As a final note, I definitely do
not want the ladies from Mary
Baldwin College to think that the
Ring-tum Phi Servey is and will
be restricted to their attitudes,
ideas, and experiences. Next week,
the R-tP Poll will move down the
road for a close look at the love-
lies from another of the “suitcase”
colleges—Sweet Briar. So, stay
tuned!

Operation Gator Swamp I:
Adventures of a combat photographer

Swamp I, sponsored by W&L’s
Army ROTC unit. Gator Swamp I,
a field training exercise (FTX) the
source of al the gunfire heard last
Friday night and Saturday after-
noon just before the lacrosse
game.

Pitting members of various
classes against each other, Gator
Swamp I was an exercise more in
control of fighting units than tae-
ties, but tactics still played an im-
portant part.

My part was simple: I was out
there to take pictures for the
Army, which convinced me that
the cadets would all be firing
blanks, and that the department
would buy the film.

Actually, I wanted to go, and
serving as a photographer for the
unit was my entry into the lists of
combat.

Friday afternoon I showed up
at the ROTC building and was is-
sued full web gear for the evening
exercise, patrolling and raids. I
was a member of a three man
squad assigned to defend the blue
forces patrol base.

I was also issued an M-16 with
two full magazines of blank am-
munition and left for dinner.

I returned to the ROTC build-
ing from dinner to paint my face.

Trot in ankle-deep mud. It was
done at something between march-
ing and double time, due to the
marvelous traction. By the time
we reached the patrol base, the
mud was climbing up to my knees.
The cadence for the last part of
our trot was similar to slop, slide,
slop, squish.

1830: we had reached the pat-
rol base, sent out our attack pat-
rols, listening posts, outposts and
set up our guards. I was in the
guard detachment, one of three.
It was too dark to take pictures,
despite the full moon.

My duty was to watch for the
signal from the LP-OP which
would indicate that enemy troops
were approaching the patrol base.
The atmosphere was tense; just
waiting for something to happen
must be the most nerve-racking
part of combat.

This was accentuated, every ten
minutes or so, by the sound of
firefights in the distance bring-
ing home the perilous conditions
we were in.

2009: a firefight erupted near
our command post, probably no
more than two to three hundred
meiers from our position. The
LP-OP sent the signal after the
firefight that enemy troops were
approaching. Follownig the signal,
they melted into the woods and
retreated to the patrol base.

I prepared for a defense. If |
have to go, I thought, those red
force fiends will have to work to
take me.

The mud was not so bad, but
the ground was cold and damp. I
could feel it soaking into my
knees and chest. | was in a pretty
good position, in fair cover with a
god field of fire on the approaches
to the patrol base, so I decided not
to try to move.

After twenty minutes, I saw a
single figure approaching the base
along the trail. Here they come, I
thought, and passed the word that
there was an intruder coming
down the trail. .

At about ten meters, I took a
bead on him, saying to myself, this
sure is a dumb way to attack a
base. Since there was no pass-
word, only a recognition signal,
I felt 1 had the intruder dead to
rights, when he came over to my
position. So much for my cover
and my camoflage job.

“Where’s Mattesky?” he asked.
“I'm from Walker's platoon and
our radio went out.” There went
the vision of a glorious defense.

After he headed back out, I re-
settled myself in the weeds. Spor-
adic firing occupied my mind.

Then a more urgent matter oc-

eupied my mind, My boxer shorts -

were beginning to climb into my
crotch. I began to fidget.

2115: the LP-OP went back out
to their listening posts.

2130: I had given up on the red
forces, it was obvious they were

never going to find us.

I sat up, loosened my shorts,
leaned back on the field pack, af-
fectionately known as a butt pack,
and began to wonder when, if
ever, we might see some action.

My musings were all for naught,
because at 2200 the CO put us on
admin, the FTX word for truce or
peacetime, and called the troops
in for an evaluation. A senior eva-
luator and I walked back to the
ROTC building swapping hits off
a flask brought out into the wilds
for “medicinal purposes.”

Saturday morning proved to be
an entirely different sort of opera-
tion. After getting up and having
a delicious breakfast of C-rations
brought along especially for the
occasion, I returned to the ROTC
building. While everyone was put-
ting on their makeup I decided
that since it was such a beautiful
day, I would concentrate on shoot-
ing off the film. As a rifle would
only slow me down, I left it at the
ROTC building.

But I did don the camouflage,
a light spring camo job made up
mostly of light green and black,
with accents of olive. I looked
great!

That was before I heard the
rumor that in the midst of all that
blank ammo, somebody had
thought they heard a live round
go off the night before.

We only live once, so I checked
my light settings and prayed the
rumors were wrong.

The Turkey Trot had dried out
a little during the night and the
run was a lot easier. We were on
the run by 0800,

0905; off the Turkey Trot recon-
noitering the defense site for later
that afternoon. After a brief re-
eon, off went the blue forces for
their attack at double-time.

One of the cadre, who had serv-
ed in Vietnam and Cambodia com-
mented you don’t run on the at-
tack, but on the withdrawal. He
remembered advising Cambodian
troops and said “on the attack, I
— During withdrawals, I

{| led the way briefly so I could
get a picture. By 1955 we were in
enemy territory, We passed the
Maury Service Authority Building
and disappeared into the woods.

We had reached attack point
Charlie and were moving toward
phase line Beer, which we reached
at about 1030.

At this point, outlying members
of the patrol decided we had pick-
ed up some shadows, and the pat-
rol began moving a little more
cireumspectly. That means go
around hills instead of over them
at the half-way-up the hill point.

The Generals’ most successful
season ever ended last Friday
night on a negative note as they
lost to the Glassboro State ‘Profs’,
103-87, in the NCAA regional tour-
nament consolation game. It was
the last game for seniors Bob
Flint, Chris Larson, Steve Hand,
Kim Sims and Don Berlin.

The night before, Washington
and Lee, ranked second in the na-
tion in the Division and seeded
first in the tournament, ended
their dreams of an NCAA cham-
pionship by losing to fourth-seed-

 

ed Wiliam Paterson, 92-68, in the
first round of the regional tourna-
ment.

The only bright spot of the
whole tournament for W&L came
after the championship game,
when Dave Leunig was named to
the Tournament team.

In the championship game, Wil-
liam Paterson came back from an
eight-point halftime deficit to de-
feat North Carolina Methodist, 60-
58, thus advancing to the Division
ill Eastern regionals in Philadel-
phia this week.

Stickmen whip Duke, 18-5

by BILL FLESHER

Call them what you will—young-
sters, newcomers, even the “Kid-
die Corps” if you must.

But if their performance against
Duke Saturday is any indication,
don’t ever refer to the 17 players
in their first season of Washing-
ton and Lee’s varsity lacrosse
team as lacking in the basic skills
of the game.

For it was a group of new
names-—Mike Schuler, Jay Foster,
and Bob Clements to mention a
few—which swiped the spotlight
from the veterans as W&L open-
ed its drive for a sixth consecu-
tive appearance in the NCAA post-
season tournament by trouncing
the outclassed Blue Devils, 18-5.

Once the “old hands” had put in
a good workout the first-year
players took over and demonstrat-
ed their wares to an unusually
passive gathering of 2100 at Wil-
son Field.

“T had a really good time,” said
Schuler, the freshman attackman
whose three goals gave him game
scoring honors along with mid-
fielder Jack Dudley.

It would have been hard for any
of the Generals to have been dis-
appointed by the afternoon's
course of events. Once sophomore
attackman Chris Kearney scored
the first goal of the season just
1:13 into the game, W&L was in
command despite Duke’s efforts
to control the game’s tempo by
employing a modified stall on of-
fense.

”

W&L went on to score four
more times before Duke’s Joe Dev-
lin beat goalie Charlie Brown
from five yards out to put the
Blue Devils on the board midway
through the second period.

But the Generals laid any re-
maining doubts as to the game’s
outcome by scoring five goals in
succession to go ahead, 10-1, early
in the third stanza.

Then it was time for the new
faces. An all-freshman attack of
Schuler, Foster, and Rob Eisdor-
fer combined for five goals and
four assists in the final two quar-
ters. Clements, who took over the
netminding ‘duties from Brown at
halftime turned in a 12-save per-
formance.

Even freshman defenseman
Steve Johnson got into the scoring
act, beating the high-scoring Tom
Keigler to the 1977 scorebook by
setting up classmate Art DeCarlo
for a fourth-quarter goal.

“It was great to see that every-
body contributed,’ W&L coach
Jack Emmer said afterward. “We
leraned that we shouldn’t be
afraid to play any of our kids in
any situation that may come up
throughout the season.”

Foster called his first college
game “a real challenge, but a
whole lot of fun.”

“Coach Emmer told us at the
beginning that it would be a lot
of hard work but that we should
never worry about not playing,

that we’d all get our time,” Foster”

added. “I love to play, but it’s

Baseball Generals
covering all hases

With twelve returning letter-
men from last year’s team, which
posted a respectable 9-13 won-
lost record while facing a tough
schedule with only two healthy
pitchers, the baseball Generals
appear to be ready to make 1977
the year they put it all together.

With an enthusiasm which
Coach Joe Lyles says is unprece-
dented, the Generals are ready to
take on the demands of the chal-
lenging schedule before them.
Teams like Lynchburg, Liberty
Baptist, William and Mary, and
Randolph-Macon are no pushovers
by any means, and Coach Lyles
knows this. “Our schedule this
year is as tough a one as we could
play. Almost every one of our
games in the ODAC is away, and
that could cause us some trouble
unless we play the way we can.
which means winning baseball. To
win you need the essentials of
tight defense, good, consistent
pitching, and clutch hitting. I
think we've got the material to do
all the above and more very well.”

Lyles, never one to overstate
his feelings about a ball club,
could easily be right this year
about his team’s chances. The
major area where the Generals
got in trouble last year was the
pitching department, where only
senior co-captain Dan Westbrook
and senior Bill .Gregg provided
stability. This year, after Lyles’
extensive recruiting efforts, pro-
mises to be one in which the Gen-
erals may have trouble deciding
who to pitch with all the talent
they have. Freshman Chip Childs,
Vic Shepherd, Tracey Hodge, and
Bay Steele, along with returning
lettermen Mike Rhodes and Bruce
Williams, make up a formidable
pitching staff, Lyles notes, “These
young pitchers, although lacking
college experience, had outstand
ing records in high school and the
depth they give us will be a defin
ite key in our numerous double
header appearances this spring.”

    

fe

  
 
 

If these youngsters, under the gui-
dance of the veterans, can show
the poise needed to be successful
collegiate pitchers, the Generals
could go a long way.

One way of building up the con-
fidence of the youngsters is to
drill them in the fundamentals, a
task at which Lyles is an acknowl-
edged leader, getting the pitchers
to think about every pitch, the
situation, and where to position
the infielders. The only weak spot
in this otherwise talent-laden pit-
ching corps is the lack of any left-
handed pitchers, a fact which en-
ables the opposing team to stack
its lineup with lefthanded hitters.

The infield this year is basically
the same as last year, the only ex-
ception being the noticable ab-
sence of Dave Otey, a four-year
letterman who was lost to gradua-
tion. Filling his position will be
Bob Szezecinski, an all-VCAA se-
lection at designated hitter last
season. “Choosy” has the bat to
keep him in the line-up, and his
quick hands and powerful aim
could make people forget Otey
very quickly.

At shortstop, Lyles had planned
on junior Ted Hissey starting, but
post-football season knee surgery
has cut down on Teddy’s ability to
work out at full tilt so far. Hissey,
a clutch hitter and fine glove man,
will be lost for only the first week
or so, but by then may have trou
ble unseating senior Mickey Clary,
whose consistent hitting and vast
ly improved fielding has impress
ed everyone

At second base the Generals are
blessed with senior co-captain Ben
Bonaventura, a polished infielder
who is the team leader both on
the field and off. Lyles says
“Ben's always thinking baseball!
whether it be in December or
June. His keen concentration and
enthusiasm motivates the rest of
the team to play its best, and

Ben's ability to tutor the young

great just to be a part of all of
this, to cheer the guys on from the
sideline.”

The “guys” Foster referred to
gave a good early season account
of themselves in the season open-
er. Kearney, Johnny Black, Doug
Fuge, and Jay Sindler each scored
twice, while attackman Jeff Fritz
added three assists. The only dis-
paraging note was the Generals’

poor faceoff performance. Four
W&L players managed to win just
11 of 28 faceoffs, a statistie which
must be improved with the rugged
schedule that lies ahead for W&L.

But as Emmer noted, “It was an
early-season game, and we know
that we have plenty of room to
improve.”

Even if the rookies did play like
it was mid-season.

NCAA performance

disappoints wrestlers

The wrestling team finished out
its season last week with a disap-
pointing finish in the NCAA
championships in Binghamton,
NY. W&L’s four representatives
returned to Lexington on Sunday
with only one win among them,
having been soundly defeated by
the stiff competition.

Boyd Breeding netted the only
win of the Generals as he defeated
an opponent from MIT by a 17-8
superior decision. Boyd Controlled
his opponent on his feet in order
to mount up the winning margin.
In his next match however, he
found that the tables had been
turned and he was in the unfami-
liar position of being dominated
on takedowns. This proved to be
the deciding factor as Boyd, left

without his main offensive wea-
pon, was soundly defeated.

Ray Gross turned out to be the
victim of a poor draw in the seed-
ings. As luck would have it, Ray
drew the first seeded wrestler and
was simply defeated by a superior
opponent. To make matters worse,
the Montelair grappler was de-
feated two rounds later which pre-
vented Ray from moving on to the
consolation rounds.

Ed Rodgers was defeated by a
Brockport wrestler on a close deci-
sion in the first round. Rodgers
put his opponent to his back and
was winning 7-4 going into the
third period. Brockport rallied
and came back to take the “Stork”
down twice in the third period to

ous attacks as Teddy Roosevelt’s
charge up San Juan Hill in Cuba
or Pork Chop Hill in Korea. At the
time, I was far too busy. Getting a
couple of shots of troops fording
Whistle Creek through green
smoke, I had to run like hell to
catch up to the front. But I was
slowed down, as I passed a squad
radio operator whose butt pack
had snagged on the barbed wire
fense.

After freeing him, I nearly got
caught on the thing myself, but
managed to get free and ran hell-
for-leather to the front of the col-
umn and past, half way up the hill
to the shelter of some rocks, got
down, turned around, raised the
camera just in time to hear Major
Wolf Kutter, the advisor for the
red forees say “Cease Fire.”

Damn!!! All that for nothing.

Following the critiques of both
sides (it all went pretty well all
considering, only one sprained an-
kle: all agreed the proper way to
take the hill was to use artillery
to blow the people out of their
holes) it was off to the defensive
site, many hills back in the other
direction.

Oh, my aching legs. I was get-
ting to hate the sight of ground
which went uphill.

1230: back at the defensive site.
\fter everybody was in position,
everybody had lunch. More C-ra
tions. Really, they’re pretty good,
especially with a little tabasco
sauce and especially when you are
hungry. There was no real rush,
because the enemy wasn’t suppos-
ed to cross into the attack phase

1245: we went tactical (just as

admin means peace, tactical
means non-peace).
1315: we saw the red forces

crossing the hills in front of our
position across the crest.

Now I have to admit that we
knew they were coming, and they
knew we knew they were coming,
but still, that is dumb.

Shortly, they were at the base
of our hill. Epithets began passing
back and forth between defenders
and attackers. Most have escaped
my mind, which is just as well,
beeause the editor would never
let me print them. They involved
the immediate and distant ances-
try of the attackers, their dietary
habits, and some cast aspersions
upon not only their courage, but
their manhood. (That was really
unfair, because one of the depart-
ment’s exchange students from
Sem was on the red side)

At this point I moved out about
25 meters downhill from the de-
fensive perimeter and prepared to
shoot off a whole roll of film.

The red forees popped red
smoke, appropriate I thought, and
began to move uphill. I was ready
to take pictures as the heroic (but
futile, after all one does pick sides
in these things despite a journa-
list’s objectivity) attackers came
through the smoke.

Just as they started to come
through the smoke, some brave
soul picked up the smoke gernade
and heved it another ten meters
up the hill.

I turned tail, moved ten meters
up the slope and got ready to take
that picture again.

Then it was all over, all that
frenetic action just came to an
end

tie the score at the buzzer. Rod-
gers lost a point on riding time,
however to lose the match 11-10.

The biggest disappointment of
the weekend came as captain Jim
Crytzer lost to a St. Lawrence
wrestler to finish out his W&L
career. Jim’s record of 65-31-5 is
the best career record in W&L’s
history. This season was probably
the best of Crytzer’s four years at
W&L as he compiled a 25-6 sea-
son record, led the team in team
points, placed first in two tourna-
ments, second in two others, plac-
ed fourth in the state, was named
most valuable wrestler in two
tournaments, and was ODAC
champ. In addition, Jim served as
team captain and was instrumen-
tal in molding the young W&L

squad into a formidable team
which compiled a 10-3 record
against tough competition.

Despite the disappointment of
the nationals, the Generals have
no reason to be dissatisfied with
the entire séason. Despite the loss
of the team’s two seniors, Jim
Crytzer and Bill Cole, the team
should return next year stronger
than ever before. This year’s crop
of freshmen has gained valuable
varsity experience. In addition,
next year should find quite a few
experienced Juniors and Seniors
getting the starting nod, which is
a situation that we have not seen
here in the last few years. In
short, Coach Franke can spend the
off-season with a smile on his face,
knowing that the good times have
just begun.

Track team takes second

by JERRY HARRIS

The writing was on the wall.
After a season that saw the Gen-
erals indoor track team hampered
by injuries, it was only natural
that the same nemesis would ap-
pear in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championship meet.
Due to the pivotal injury of co-
captain John Tucker, W&L fell
short of Lynchburg to finish see-
ond in the ODAC.

Midway through the meet on
Saturday, W&L was in literal
deadlock with Lynchburg and
Bridgewater for first place. It was
then, during the 440 yard relay,
that Tucker pulled his hamstring.
\s a result, W&L placed second
in that relay event which they
should have won. The loss of Tue-
ker also hurt the Generals in the
60 yard dash and the mile relay.
Coach Norris Aldridge noted “that
(the injury) really cost us the
meet.”

Despite the disappointing sec-
ond place finish, the Generals still
performed better than they ever
have in the indoor championships
W&L had three individuals win
their events while several more
placed to account for the team’s

73 points. Lynchburg won with 78
points while Bridgewater and Roa-
noke scored 68 and 10 points re-

Phil Dunlay continued his strong
efforts in the weight events by
winning the 35 pound weight
throw and placing second in the
shot. Norvell Scott, shackled by a
knee injury all year, won the long
jump with his best jump ever in
indoor competition. Mike Burns
warmed up for the outdoor sea-
son by winning the two mile run
with a time of 9:48:7.

Following is a breakdown of
the team scoring for the Generals:

Backing him up will be either Guy

‘tools of ignorance” behind the

ball as well as throw out op

Looking at the outfield, Lyles
ias got to have a bie grin on his

lon

face. While having lost Mike Fal
cone from what Lyles has termed
“the best outfield I've ever coach
ed,” sophomores Rick Wiles and
David Hundley return to give the
Generals the needed hitting punch
and defense. Wiles (313) and
Hundly €301) not only are ex
tremely clutch players both be
hind the plate and in the field
but also provide the Generals with
excellent speed and savvy on the
basepaths. Both of these men
should gain some sort of post-sea
son recognition this year. Filling
in at right field could be Lyles’
hardest task, since no fewer than
four fine outfielders are vying for
that position. Sophomore Chuck
D'Auria seems to have the inside
track on the job, but freshmen
Don Swadert and Pete Restaino
both excellent hitters. and senior:
Bob Carpentier, are pressing D’
Auria hard and could make the
choosing of a starter in right field
a tough but pleasant chore for the
coach

Washington and Lee is now a

versity relatively little, while pro-
viding approximately twenty stu-
dents with the opportunity § to
compete.” In other words, we al-
ready own a pool and there’s
abundant student interest.

Having competed as a club for
the past six years, water polo as a
varsity sport was obviously not a
“spur-of-the-moment”  considera-
tion freshly out of the starting
blocks. Last year this club team
finished their season 6-1 in dual
meets and second in the Virginia
State Tournament. Although all-
stater Ted Van Leer and last
year’s high-scoring Bill Gregg will
be graduating, the rest of the
squad is young and returning.

In fact, a junior varsity program
is also scheduled which, along
with the Varsity program, will
compete with schools such as Co-
lumbia University, Villanova, Sy-
racuse, Penn State, the University
of Pennsylvania, and arch rival
Johns Hopkins University. It is
also rumored that these schools
will sport co-ed teams.

But how does water polo fit into
the W&L sports program? Most
appropriately, as water polo of-
fers at least a taste of every sport
now being played at W&L. Though
the rules are applied somewhat
differently, water polo features
both the dribbling and passing of
a basketball game, and requires
the endurance of a long distance
runner. The game also necessit-
ates the hand-eye coordination of
a baseball pitcher, while the ob-

Congressional interns

sought by Rep. Butler

Four interns will be selected to
work during two separate one-
month sessions in Congressman M.
Caldwell Butler’s Washington of
fice. College students who are
residents of the Sixth Congres
sional District of Virginia are
eligible to apply.

Applications are available in
Butler’s Washington office located
in Room 409 Cannon House Office
Building, Washington, D. C. 20515
and all District Offices.

The two-one month sessions will
begin June 13 and July 11 respec-
tively. Each intern will be paid a
salary established by the U. S.
House of Representatives of at
least $500, and each will be re
sponsible for all expenses.

In the past many interns have
found inexpensive temporary
housing at George Washington
University, according to Butler.

The deadline for filing applica
tions to participate in the Summer
Intern program is March 11.

promising. With the perfect blend
of youngsters and veterans, this
team could produce a solid winner
for this year and years to come

“The talent is there,” says Lyles
“All they have to do is just relax
and play the baseball they're cap
able of playing, and we'll be right
in the thick of the ODAC race,
maybe even the NCAA's. But I'm
not going to make any long-range
predictions now; I'm just going to
play each game one at a time, and
go from there. We're young, but
our enthusiasm and veterans
should make up for any problems
of inexperience we may encounter
during the season.”

ject he throws resembles a soccer
ball. Like football, a player may
be tackled when in possession of
the ball, and as in lacrosse a “face-
off” takes place when rightful pos-
session is undecided.

When the ball is at the “other”
end of the pool, however, it is per-
haps wrestling which predomi-
nates play. Ordinary fouls such as
“it is illegal to dunk under his (or
her) oponent while swimming
even or behind” suggest that such
activity actually oceurs during a
normal game.

The returning goalie from last
year’s team commented that “a
lot of people are afraid to come
out,” and further added that “this
will be water polo’s first year as 4
varsity sport, and we hope to get
a lot of recruits from P. E.
classes.” It just doesn’t make
sense to struggle in one of Coach
Lord’s burn-out P. E. classes, when
you can earn a varsity letter,
while “swimming” among females
in skimpy bathing suits.

Spring brings Orleans
and Crack the Sky

by FRITZ GOLDBERG

Orleans will be the lead act for
Springs Weekend according to the
usual knowledgeable sources on
the SAB.

The band, purveyors of such
classic hils as “Still the One,”
“Dance with Me” and “Let there
be Music,” will be backed up by
Crack The Sky, the people who
missed the Winter concert, and
Chris Rush, a comedian who re-
portedly told the SAB’s agent the
job would be something of a chal-
lenge for any comedian after the
considerably less-than-gentleman-
ly deseription given by some of
the reception given to a stand-up
comic who narrated the controver
sial Spinners Concert last spring.

Rush will charge $800 for the
challenge, while Orleans and
Crack the Sky will charge $7500
and $2000, respectively.

Annual Black Ball

in Evans Saturday

by BOB CHIAVIELLO

For all of those poor people
who are feeling the post Fancy
Dress Blues there is hope! Tab
Brown, the coordinator of Black
Awareness Activities, promises
that this year’s Black Ball will be
bigger and better than ever.

The theme for this Saturday's
Ball is “A Night at the Copa.”
rhe festivities begin at 7:30 p.m
on Saturday with a cocktail party
at the Alumni House. This party is
open to everyone with a ticket
After the cocktail party everyone
will head on over to Evans Dining
Hall te bask in the recreated at
mosphere of the famous Copa Cab
bana. The band for the evening
will be Anglo Saxon Brown, a big
contemporary soul band with both
rock and gospel influences. The
band features eight vocalists and
they promise to put on a great
show. There will be non-aleoholix
refreshments served at the Ball,
put there will be no beer allowed

Members of the Student Associa
tion for Black Unity, the Student
Activities Board, and others will
be working feverishly next

The weekend will begin with
the traditional BYOB, party at the
Pavillion on Thursday night. The
Thursday night in question will be
April 14, 1977, and the perform-
ers for the party will be the Mar-
vellettes, presenting their show
for $950, one-third off their usual
price, according to Bob Chia-
viello, SAB member.

The ladies are reducing their
prices as a means of doing pen-
ance for backing out of the Home-

coming dance. The back-out at
that event cost the SAB about

$1000 when they were forced to
substitute another band at the last
minute and cancel the $1 admis-
sion fee to avoid anger from stu-
dents who felt slighted by the
lack of Marvellettes at the dance.

Crack the Sky agreed to appear
for the concert in order to fulfill
their contract obligations left
over when James Talley replaced
them at the Winter concert.

The Spring concert will be on
Friday, April 15, and tickets will
cost W&L students $2.50 in ad-
vance. Cost for all others will be
$3.50 in advance. The cost at the
door will be $4 for all comers. The
concert will be held in the new
gym

Although there is no lacrosse
game before the junior class grain
party on Saturday, April 16, Chia-
viello said the SAB will be pre
senting several “immodest” acti
vities to brighten up other Satur
days in the Spring term

Although Chiaviello would not
elaborate, sources close to the
SAB say there may be a grain
party or other amusements follow
ing the U. Va. game the following
weekend

Bodenstab, Craig Cornett, Walton
Clark, Cove Geary, Jacob Jones,
Ned McDonnell, Sam Perkins and
Tom Salley.

Vying for president of the class
of ’80 are Greg Dyer, Les Cotter,
Sonny Wilkinson and Murray Mc-
Clintock. Vice-presidential candi-
dates are: Jeff Barlett, Dave Con-
stine, Carl Lowder and Hugh Mon-
tgomery.

The two referenda that will try
again on Monday are a proposed
amendment to the constitution
that would move freshman elec-
tions ahead two weeks and an-
other that would give the E.C. the
power to remove a candidate from
the ballot for breaking E.C.-im-
posed rules.

Both proposals received appro
val by a majority of the students
voting but neither received the
two-thirds majority required for
addition to the constiution, nor
cid enough students vote. Fifty
per cent of the student body must
vote on proposed amendments in
order for them to pass.

Only about 500 persons voted
in the March 7 elections. Approxi
mately 850 must vote for any
amendment to pass.

E. C. members expressed the
hope thal because so many per-
sons were running for office in
Monday’s election there would be
a greater voter turnout.

The other two amendments to
be included on the ballot are one
that would give freshmen equa!
representation on the E.C. and
one that would limit the number

Workers sought

for game room

In an effort to provide more
games for students and to keep
damage in the game room to a
minimum, the W&L Cockpit is
looking for students to keep order
in the game room.

This is a long established tra-
dition which fell into disuse dur-
ing the last few years and which
Jerry Darrell is trying to revive.

The duties will be light, and
students will have some, though
not full-time, game privileges and
will be able to earn $1 an hour be-
sides

Darrell is trying to increase the
variety of games available to stu-
dents, in addition to other changes
made in the Cockpit

Such additions will include, Dar
rell hopés, ping pong, chess,
checkers and darts

The work will consist of issu
ing pool cues and balls, making
change, issuing chess and checker
sets, and preventing the entry of
beer and other forbidden liquors
into the game room

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

So much for non-participation in student government,
We've got more people running here than in the Boston Mara-
thon.

Now let's take a look at some of the activities in which
various student governmental bodies are engaged:

The Student Control Committee, enforcement arm of the
office of the Dean of Students, has announced stiff new penal-
ties for smoking marijuana in the dorms (see Randy Smith's
article on this page).

This move is so ridiculous that it’s difficult to decide how
to attack it. It's stupid, senseless, and repressive. It surprises
me because I had always respected the University policy on
drugs as being fairly realistic, Pot smoking, while not officially
condoned, was generally recognized as a normal social activity
and hence enforcement and punishment were generally kept
to a minimum.

The only conceivable argument against smoking is on legal
grounds. But, as Mr. Smith points out, the legal argument ts
being applied only to this one “crime.” And it's becoming in-
creasingly obvious that not only pot smokers but also a grow-
ing number of other people—lawyers, judges, politicians, mecli-
cal experts—find the laws against possession to be worthless,
or worse still, counterproductive.

From Mary Russell’s March 15 Washington Post article :

The Carter administration yesterday endorsed re-
moving federal criminal penalties for possession of small
amounts of marijuana, but said it should be left to the
states to decide whether to decriminalize their own pos-
session laws.

Dr. Peter G. Bourne, director-designate of the Office
of Drug Abuse Policy, said decriminalization “seems to
have been an effective and appropriate approach” in the
eight states that have dropped criminal penalties for
simple possession so far ., .

Bourne said the criminal penalties for possession are
“counterproductive” and “have resulted in otherwise
law-abiding young people spending time in prison and
incurring permanent damage to their careers and their
ability to enter professions.”

He said as many as 35 million Americans have tried
marijuana and as many as 11 million are now using the
drug at least weekly. The sixth annual report of the Na-
tional Institute of Drug Abuse released last week said
15 milion people used marijuana once or more times in
the month preceding its survey.

One can only hope that the legal argument against possession
and use of marijuana will indeed soon be put to rest, clearing
the way for the Student Control Committee and theid admini-
tration masters to group their way out of the Dark Ages,

Something else bothers me about this. Washington an‘
Lee's most distinguishing and valuable feature has long been
its faith in the individual and the individual's right to self-

ernment without external controls. This sudden lureh in the
other direction must come as a shock to any student who has
come to value that liberty which both our nation and our Uni-
versity claim to insure. Unless, of course, he has suffered so
many blows to his liberty that one more seems to mak: litth

by RANDY SMITH

In a statement dated March 8
(but posted the 13th), the Student
Control Committee announced
new penalties for marijuana smok-
ers in the Washington and Lee
dormitories, The new, more strin-
gent penalties—(1) a minimum of
a $50 fine, (2) a minimum of two
weeks social probation, and (3) a
letter home to the parents about
the incident—will be imposed on
any dormitory resident who is
“caught with marijuana ina dor-
mitory, whether in his room or
another’s room, whether smoking
or voluntarily in the presence of
persons smoking marijuana.”

The edict issued from Student
Control implies that W&L fresh-
men have a serious drug problem.
There are “widespread, illegal ac-
tivities” going on in the dormi-
tories—an expression of a subver-
sive revolutionary outbreak in
the offing, perhaps. Certainly, the
phrasing of the statement sug-
gests that a large number of peo-
ple are involved in these ‘“‘wide-
spread” law breaking activities. In
fact, however, “seven or eight”
freshmen have come before the
Committee for marijuana viola-
tions in the past six months.

David Meyer, President of the
Freshman class and member of the
Student Control Committee—and
who, by the way, voted in favor
of the more austere punishments
—explained the implementation of
the new penalties as a result of an
apparent escalation of “open”
marijuana use. According to Mey-
er, three cases came before the
Committee in late February. They
were interpreted as examples that
fragrant drug use in the dorms
was on the rise and that the old
penalties (a $15-$25 fine and one
week dorm probation) were not
enough.

Meyer explained thatthe Uni-
versity has an agreement with the
Lexington police to handle mari-
juana smokers in the dormitories
(in the person of Student Control);
in return, the police will not raid
the campus. The grim picture Mey-
er painted conjured images of po-
lice making indiscriminate mid-
night raids in search of drug
abusers. He said the new penal-
ties were a “deterent’” and that
“in the long run, everyone will be
benefited by them; they are in
the best interest of everyone in
the dorms” because they will keep
the police out.

Head dorm counselor Tony Van
Burg, when asked if the Student
Control Committee’s pronounce
ment meant that dorm counselors
might engage in special search
and spying procedures, replied
that he did not condone such ac
tivities. He went on to say that the
new penalties “should have been
instituted earlier” because it
would be unfair for those caught
after March 8, to suffer more
stringent punishment than those
caught before

Despite Meyer's positive “bene
fits” attitude and Van Den Burg’s
assurances against intensified co-
vert dorm counselor surveillance
activities, there have been grumb
lings im the freshmen dorms
Some view the new penalties as
oppressive and dated, Others
point to the changing national at
titude discounting marijuana as
the dangerous drug its crities de
scribe it as. But such arguments
do not affect the rules of Wash-
ington and Lee

In its policy, the University does
not concern itself with moral
questions or the mounting body of
ssientifie fact exculpating the
myths surrounding marijuana
That dope has become increasing
ly more accepted, has been de
criminalized in a growing number
of states, and that the Carter Ad
ministration recently reconmmmend
ed home plant growers of the
drug not be prosecuted, are not at
issue

University policy revolves
around the illegality of marijuana
in the State of Virginia (Cade of
Virginia, Tithe 18, 18.2250, 18.2
964, 18.2-265). As far as the school
is concerned, the law is the law

right or wrong—and the Univer
sity will not allow students to
break state law on school pro

perty. And it is in their support
of University policy where the
Student Control Committee is in
consistent

jever mind the fact that the
Committee's penalties for dope

jokers have changed (and, in
deed. have become more stricl) a

the years have passed, or that the
penalty can change on the Com-
mittee’s whim with no method for
appeal—these are trivial
sistencies. If the Student Control
Coremiltee is really dedicated to
following University policy by up-
holding the law, why are they se-
lective in the laws they choose to
sustain? i

Title 4, of the Code of Virginia,
addresses itself to alcoholic bev-

your mother. should know

this statute (and continue to do
so) is, if not a majority, a signi-
ficant minority. We are not talk-
ing about “7 or 8” freshmen, but
well over 200.

Another interesting Virginia law
(Title 18, 18.2-68), discusses ‘‘se-
duction” and leading a female “as
tray from the paths of virtue.” It
is, apparently, a rather significant
statute because it carries a pen-
alty of 2-10 years in jail (as op-
posed to up to 12 months and-or
up to $1000 fine for possession of
marijuana).

But freshmen who use alcohol
or who are guilty of corrupting a
female's virtue are safe. The Stu-
dent Control Committee can be se-
lective in the Virginia State laws

it chooses to uphold-—all in the
good name of University policy.
Apparently, drinking and seduc-
tion are not important because
dorm counselors are allowed to
handle those incidents; they are
socially acceptable laws to break
—-as long as you are careful. But
inhale a breath of marijuana in
the dormitories, and you have
crossed the line. Your fate is not
to be counselled, but punished.

To voice his opinion on the new
penalties, an anonymous heretic
defaced one of the Committee’s
posted prociaimations with: “Help
bring W&L out of the Middle Ages
--smoke dope wherever you like.”
He is one of those subversive re-
volutionaries, no doubt.

Warsaw Pantomime Company
shares talent with drama students

by M. GRAY COLEMAN

Arthur Graham Glasgow, noted
engineer, was an honorary alum-
nus of Washington and Lee for
many years. Upon his death in
1955, he bequeathed a generous
sum to the University with this
recommendation for its use: “I!
is hoped that all such income may
be used to promote the art of ex-
pression of art by pen and tongue

in this way, the well-known
Glasgow Endowment Program was
initiated. Katherine Anne Porter,
author of such novels as Ship of
Fools and Pale Horse, Pale Rider,
inaugurated the program with her
arrival aS the first visiting Pro
fessor in 1959. She was followed
by a long line of distinguished ar
tists, including: Edward Albee
Howard Nemerov, Robert Penn
Warren, Kar! Shapiro, James Dic
key and last year, a most suc
cessful symposium on modern fi
tion with Walker Percy, Grace
Paley, Donald Barthelme, and
William Gass

This year, the Glasgow Endow
ment Committee has provided
Washington and Lee with an en
tirely new experience. The War
Pantomime Company, having
brought to Lexington during thi
past autumn two stunning perfor
mances of their repertory, “The
Mirror” and “Beyond the Word,”
have returned for the rest of thi
term as Artists-in-Residence and
visiting lecturers in theatre. The
founders of the Company—Raj
mund Klechot, Stefan Niedzial
kowski, Zdzislaw Starczynowski
ind Andrzej Szczuzewski—began
their careers as members of the
Wroclaw Mime Theatre under the
direction of Henryk Tomaszewski
and for many years created a var
iety of major roles in production
at theatres and festivals around
the world, During these
they developed their own, origina
theory of pantomime. Finally, in
left Tomaszewski afte
more than a decade, and formed
group. Today they are

designed to embrace different as
pects of theatre art every year.
The four founders have been join
ed in Lexington by the fifth mem-
ber of their company, Ms. Jolanta
Kruszewska, formerly the pre
miere ballerina of the Wroclaw
Opera. This classically trained
group, renowned across Europe
and beyond, are now forming a
show for this University, to be
presented on March 23-25, Wed-
nesday through Friday ,at the
Troubadour Theatre.

The turnout of students has been
especially encouraging; over 35
peovle are participating in the in

truction sessions and show re

hearsals. They include many W&L
students, as well as a healthy num
ber of auditors from the town it-
self.

The group was told to approach
their new assignment in a simple
way; they were to act as if their
students knew nothing about
body-movement. They were to be
seen as merely “hunks of raw
meat.” And, in two short weeks,
they have beat this group of peo
ple into remarkable shape. The
main answer was long periods of
gdueling exercise, but gradually
they inserted bits of mime techni
que into the work day.

I think it only wise to address the

concerning the subject of student
misconduct down the road. There
have been enough cases of mis
conduct down the road this year to
cause certain members of our ad
ministration to worry about our

itus as gentlemen. The faculties
and administrations of the sur
rounding girls’ schools have been
so alarmed that at times they have
personal letters back to

Old Generals never die, they just keep coming back to haunt you.

Stickmen lose confidence

“We're at a point now where
we've lost a little of our confi-
dence,” says head coach Jack Em-
mer, “We did not play real well in
the win over Virginia Tech, and
we were tight in the Mt. Wash-
ington game.” The coach’s senti-
ments are echoed in the fact that
the Generals, now 2-0 in NCAA
games, and 2-1 overall, escaped
with a 10-2 win over Virginia
Tech, despite leading only 3-1 at
the half.

‘Middle Doug Fuge, named the
winner of the Cannon Award for
his play in tae Tech game, opened
the scoring at 8:50 of the second
quarter tossing in a rebound from
in front of the cage to break a
scoreless tie. Less than two min-
ules later, Fuge scored an extra
man goal to give the Generals a
iwo goal margin. Seven second
haif goals, two by the teams’ lead-
ing scorer Chris Kearney, propell-
ea W&L to the 10-2 win.

The Mt. Washington contest was
a lesson for W&L younger players
on how to make the most of your
opportunities. The 1976 lacrosse
cub champions, composed of
many former All-American per-
formers, including W&L’s Rob
Lindsey and Brian Chasney, put
on a first class shooting exhibi-
tion on Wilson Field. After lead-
ing 3-0 after one quarter of play,
ithe Generals found themselves
trailing 7-3 at the half.

The remainder of the game,
despite the fact that W&L scored
four fourth quarter goals, was a
exercise in futility. Emmer noted,
“We thought Tom Keigler played
weil against the Wolfpack, and
Chris Kearney went to the goal
well, bul some of our freshmen
haven't progressed quite as quick-
ly as we had hoped they would.”

The coaching staff singled out
freshmen midfielders Roman Ku-
pecky and Joe Olive, defenseman

Rod Roberts, and attack Mike
Schuler as four first year men
who have shown well in the team’s
first three games. The first year
men will have to hold their own
during the Generals’ upcoming
three game homestand if the team
hopes to be ranked in the nation’s
top ten teams in the national
rankings. The first USILA rank-
ings will be released on Monday,
March 21.

At one o’clock on Friday, March
4, a new first took place at Wash-
ington and Lee. The W&L Weight-
lifting Club sponsored their first
meet, a power meet, with VMI as
their guests.

The program included the stan-
dard power lifts-—bench press,
full squat, and deadlift—as well as
one exercise lift used especially
by football players and track and
field competitors, the clean. This
lift was the first performed and
each contestant was given three
chances to score his highest
weight. Ed Wick, president of the
club and pictured in last week's
Ring-tum Phi, scored the highest
in this lift with a 255 pound clean.
Ed was the only lifter in the meet
to make use of a full squat clean,
similar to that used by Olympians.
This is a very difficult method,
and requires great skill and pra-
tice to execute properly.

The meet’s lifters were divid
ed into six weight classes. W&L
scored victories in five of these.
Mickey MeKay won a decisive vic
tory for W&L at the 132-pound
class with a composite of 900

Swimmers head for championships

Seven W&L swimmers will be
spending this Thursday through
Saturday in Oberlin, Ohio com-
peting in the 1977 NCAA Division
It] Swimming Championships. The
Generals had six All-Americans
last season, and finished as the
eighth ranked Divfsion III team in
the country.

Head Coach Bill Stearns ex-
pects this years’ team to duplicate
that feat, if not surpass it. St. Law-
rence University of Canton, N. Y.
is the defending champion, with
Johns Hopkins favored in this
years’ meet. The top twelve swim-
mers in each event will be named
All-American performers for 1976-
77. Over 500 swimmers through-
out the country compete in each
event during the regular season,
with about eighty of them qualify-
ing for the national champion-
ships. The top twelve will then be
named All-Americans.

The W&L contingent travelling
to Oberlin College will be headed
by two-time national champion
and nine-time Ali-American John
Hudson, a junior freestyle special-
ist from Lancaster, Pa. Hudson, a
1976-77 co-captain, is the defend-
ing national champion in the 500
and 1650 freestyle events, and was
also named an All-American on
the W&L 800 free relay team in
‘76. The Generals’ other co-cap-
tain, Tad Van Leer, was an A-A
in the 50 free last season.

Keith Romich and Chip Hoke, a
pair of sophomores, round out the
four returning A-A going back for
another shot this season. Three
blue chip freshmen will also be
representing W&L this weekend.
Freestylers Scott Duff and Bob

Newcomb, along with backstroker -

and individual medley performer
Drew Pillsbury will be aiming to
become A-A in their first collegi-
ate season.

Weightlifters win first meet

by a 285 pound full squat. Ed
Wick followed by winning the
198 class with a 1225 pound total,
and John X. Miller took control of
the 220-pound class with a pheno-
mental 1315 pound total. A 460-
pound deadlift highlighted his
competitive performance. Mark
Duncan, another 20-pounder, set
the meet bench press record with
an astounding 310-pound lift.

The W&L iron men put in a
great deal of time and effort to
attain their high degree of excell-
ence. They plan to sponsor an-
other meet in late April, and VMI
promises to put forth a much
stronger showing.

New Chinese program offered

March 7th,

By a vote of the faculty on
W&L students who

would like to begin or continue
the study of Chinese among the
Chinese themselves now have a
means to do so.

This summer, for the first time,

W&L will conduct a ten-week sum-
mer program in Taiwan where stu-
dents may earn up to nine credit
hours for language study.

This summer program has been

made possible by the generous
subscription of Mr. Sung-hsiung
Ilung, a Taiwan industrialist.

Mr. Hung has offered to pro-

vide, free of cost, room, board and

extensive

local and recreational

travel for five W&L students each
summer for a period of three
years.

Students will, as a result, have
to pay only a tuition fee plus their
transportation to and from Tai-
wan. The exact amount of the tui-
tion has not yet been fixed, but it
is expected to be moderate in
view of the subscription.

The program, tentatively sche-
duled to begin in Taiwan on June
20th an end on August 28th, will
be conducted by Dr. Harold C.
Hill, Director of East Asian
Studies, with a staff of native in-
structors.

Track team wins
first outdoor meet

by JERRY HARRIS

It wasn’t very pretty but it was

a victory. Those were the feelings
of the Washington and Lee track
team Saturday after they had
come from behind to defeat David-
son College 81-64 in the first out-
door meet of the season.

The Generals had easily beaten

Davidson last year and during the
recently completed indoor season,
so the away meet was not consid-
ered a stiff test for them. How-
ever, the combination of the long
trip, bad weather, some key in-

juries and an

inspired perfor-

mance by the homestanding Wild-
cats gave W&L a tough match.

Halfway through the non-con-

ference dual meet the Generals
found themselves down by 11
points. That was not so bad ex-

cept that co-captain John Tucker
was injured and they were miss-
ing Hix Green in the hurdles. But
strong performances by Phil Dun-
ley, Paul Thomson and Jack Nor-
berg pulled the Generals on top.

of fifteen hours per week in actual
classroom work during eight of
the ten weeks of their stay. The
first week will be devoted to
orientation and local sightseeing.
The final week will include a trip
over the entire island of Taiwan
in the company of six Chinese
University students. During the
academic portion of the program,
weekend excursions together with
Chinese students are also planned.

According to Dr. Hill, students
desiring to begin the Chinese
language should be encouraged to
go through this program and to
continue their study on a more
advanced level at Washington and
Lee. The Taiwan courses will be
closely coordinated with offerings
in Lexington.

The summer courses are spon-
sored by the East Asian Studies
Program which already offers
study in Taiwan and Japan during
the six week Spring Semester. The
new program will, therefore, also
provide a means for students par-
ticipating in Spring Semester
courses to remain in the Far East
for productive work at nominal
costs.

Students interested in the pro-
gram for 1977 or 1978 may obtain
further information from Dr. Hill.

Peter Quinn, president of the

house went against the amend-

Mime troupe performs
with student thespians

One look at the time demands

of the course will attest to the en-
thusiasm of those in it: 90 minutes
on weekday mornings, with an ad-
ditional 90 minutes on Monday
afternoons. And then a few hours
of rehearsal time every night for
the show. And (when all this was
over each day, this amazingly de-
dicated group of artists went back
to their apartments . . . and creat-
ed two mime productions especi-
ally for Washington and Lee, a
gift without price.

The two presentations are en-
titled “Kaleidoscope” and “Mara-
thon.” The first deals with images
of life as seen through children at
a playground. Original music for
“Kaleidoscope” is being composed
by June Morgan, recently seen as
Polly in Threepenny Opera. “Ma-
rathon” is the story of Phidipides,
the man who ran to Athens after
the Battles of Marathon in 490
B.C. Selections of music by Pink
Floyd will be used in this seg-
ment.

Reservations are necessary for
this show, and it should be re
membered that there are only
three performance nights, instead
of the usual six evenings. So calls
should be made early to the Uni-
versity Theatre box office at 463-
9111, ext. 371. The box office
opens next Monday morning, and
tickets are free for all members of
the W&L community. Also, tickets
must be picked up 24 hours before
the date of performance, or they
will be released to others.

The show, with set and lighting
design by Tom Ziegler and cos-
tume design by Al Gordon, begins
at 8 p.m. every night. It will serve
as the culmination of a marvelous
visit. The Poles and students to-
gether form an astonishing com-
pany—the latter, because they
have given themselves over tot-
ally to the tutelage and talent of
the former. For this university, it
is clear that a group with these
special talents may never come
around again. If you ever plan to
see the beauty of mime, March 23-
25 is your chance.

Sources said that after the meet-
ing Howdy Knipp of the Delta
Tau Delta house also said that he
would have voted for the amend-
ment if the effects had been clear.

Quinn and Knipp were both
candidates for IFC vice-president.

Jones said Tuesday night that
his only hope was for Robinson to
call two consecutive meetings
Wednesday night to take the two
votes necessary to make any
change in the constitution. Jones
and Mattesky both said Tuesday
they did not think Robinson would
do so.

Mattesky said the group voting
against the amendment was basic-
ally centered around a Phi Kappa
Sigma-Sigma Alpha Epsilon coali-
tion, and did not follow traditional
Red Square voting lines. Robinson
is a member of SAE and Sult, sec-
ond man in the first presidential
election, isa Phi Kap. .

Greer, representing Kappa Al-
pha, also voted against the
change.

Jones’s house, Phi Kappa Psi,
voted for the amendment.

Mattesky said that several of
the houses backing the eligibility
amendment were planning a meet-
ing before the IFC gathering Wed-
nesday night to come up with a
compromise candidate whom all
of the houses could back against
the Phi Kap-SAE nominee.

Robinson, a member of SAE,
said he accepted full blame for
Jones's ineligibility not being dis-
covered earlier. “I take total re-
sponsibility,” he said. “I wish it
had come to light before this.”

Jones admitted Tuesday night
that he had not read the IFC con-
stitution before running for presi-
dent of the organiation, but added
that apparently no one currently

for Monday after backers of Jones
pointed out that besides the late
discovery of Jones’s ineligibility,
the constitutional clause placing
the IFC elections on the same day
as the Big Three balloting was not
followed.

The new election will be held in
conjunction with the class officer
and E. C. voting next week.

In the vice-presidential ballot-
ing, also invalidated Tuesday
night, Knipp led with 156 votes,
Marshall Jemison followed with
129 and Quinn was the third man
with 103 votes.

Honor scholarship fund

set up anonymously

A $200,000 gift has been-made
to W&L by an anonymous benefac-
tor to establish a series of-Honor
Scholarships in memory of the
late Edward Charles Tonsmeire, a
prominent Mississippi banker and
attorney who died in 1972.

The Honor Scholarships will be
awarded to students whose rec-
ords demonstrate exceptional
character, achievement, and per-
sonal promise as well as financial
need.

Initially, preference will be giv-
en to students from the original
13 states. The scholarships will be
awarded to entering freshmen un-
dergraduates. Each _ recipient’s
scholarship will be renewable
throughout his undergraduate ca-
reer at W&L.

Mr. Tonsmeire was a 1932 gra-
duate of W&L and received his
law degree from Cumberland Uni-
versity in 1935. He served four
and a half years in the Coast
Guard during World War II as a
legal officer on the staff of Rear

on the IFC had either.

David Constine played Jay Leven-

cision, 6-3, 6-1. In an exhibition
match Pat Norris was defeated by
Dave Snyder 6-1, 6-4.

In the doubles, W&L lost all
three decisions but all the matches
were vigorously contested. At
number one doubles Davidson-Ir-
win over Johns-Jackson 6-2, 7-6.
At number two doubles Weiss-

doubles Snyder-Levenson edged
Makepeace-Shuford 6-3, 6-7, 7-6.

Though W&L lost this match
Coach Bussard was not worried.
As he says, “I expect us to have a
winning season. If I could sche-
dule twenty-five teams that I knew
were better than we were |
would.” In this way W&L’s fresh-
men can gain tough match experi-
ence to compete successfully in
the Division Il] NCAA tournament
(May 18-22). Meanwhile Bussard
is counting on Captain Ken Voel-
ker and number one man Ben
Johns to lead the way to a winning
season.

Fertilizer hits ventilator
on pot penalties question
EC member smokes in protest

by LEE HOWARD

Lighting up and smoking what
appeared to be a marijuana cigar-
ette, Rick Goddard told the Execu-
tive Committee Monday night that
the stricter marijuana sanctions
imposed recently by the Student
Control Committee were “fool-
ish.”

The freshman law representa-
tive’s action was followed by more
than half an hour of heated de-
bate that ended when the E. C.
voted to hold a student body meet-
ing about pot rules in the Spring.

Goddard said the most foolish
thing about the rules is that they
apply only to the dorms. “T’ll give
my key to anyone who wants to
smoke here in the E.C. room,” he
said.

He said there’s never been an
agreement between police and
W&L that there will be no drug
raids on campus. That argument
for the legitimacy of the commit-
tee’s action “is a fallacy,” he said.
He said he got his information
from Lexington Police Chief J. A.
Kirby.

Dean and police chief
discuss enforcement

The reaction has been swift and
definite to last week's article on
the Student Control Committee’s
unanimous decision to stiffen the
penalties for smoking pot in the
dorms. The E.C, debated the mat-
ter Monday night and set up a
student body meeting for April
(see accompanying story). Stu-
dent Control President Bill Craver
wrote a letter giving the commit-
tee’s side of the story (see p. 2).
And the R-tP reporter who wrote
last week's story talked to Dean
of Freshmen William A. Noell and
Lexington Police Chief J. A. Kirby
about drug laws and their enforce-
ment on and off campus.—

by RANDY SMITH

Dean William A. Noell said in
in interview Monday, that he
viewed the Student Control Com-
mittee’s stated reasons for more
stringent penalties as a “possible
overreaction.”

When asked if the drug problem
in the freshman dormitories con-
stituted “widespread, illegal acti
vities,’” Dean Noell replied that,
in his perception, there had been
a few more cases brought to Stu
dent Control's attention than in
past years. “That's the only gauge
I have as to how widespread or

”

nonwidespread the problem is,
he said.

“If you make the assumption
that counselors, over the course of
two or three years, have been uni-
formly diligent in enforcing the
rule, and you are confronted with
the situation that there are more
reported cases this year than in
the past, then you will inevitably
reach the conclusion that there is
a little more marijuana smoking
in the dorms than there has been
in the past. But the assumption
that counselors are uniformly dili-
gent about that, year in-year out,
is a bad assumption,” he warned.

Asked if one could infer from
his comments that he thought the
Student Control Committee hod
overreacted, he said that he was
not quite sure he could accept the
word overreacted. “But their char-
acterization of the drug situation
as ‘widespread,’ strikes me as a
possible overreaction. Our posi
tion is that they are beter equipp
ed to judge, and I would not be
inclined to second-guess them as
long as that is the policy.”

In a conversation with Lexing-
ton Police Chief James A. Kirby,
the Ring-tum Phi was seemingly
assured that the police would not

Another foolish thing about the
committee’s action is that it at-
tacks marijuana smokers, not has-
hish or cocaine users, he said.
Also it ignores other Virginia laws
such as the one against use or pos-
session of liquor by anyone under
21 and fornication and seduction
laws, he said.

It’s the lack of consistency
which bothers him, he said.

Goddard urged any student who
was found with marijuana to sue
his dorm counsellors for trespass-
ing.

Mike Cleary, president of the
junior class and a member of Stu-
dent Control, said none of the
counsellors who have found stu-
dents smoking marijuana have
trespassed. He said one case was
discovered when a counselor went
to a freshman’s room at 3 a.m. to
ask him to turn down his stereo.

Even straight counsellors don’t

CBS correspondent Charles Kuralt

Kuralt discusses consciousness

Speaking with the humor and
charm which has popularized his
CBS series “On the Road,” Charles
Kuralt Tuesday said he has notic-
ed in his 10 years “On the Road”
a “strengthening of American
public consciousness.”

Kuralt, speaking to about 200
persons packed into Lee Chapel,
said this new public consciousness
is “a change you notice every-
where.” Ile said there are no more
“silent majorities’ or “silent
generations” (a term he said is a
propo to his own generation “even
if Time did coin it”),

He cited the example of Joel
Kean who formed a group called
“Pop's Snow Squad” which shovel
ed the driveway and walkway for
an old man without letting the
man know who was doing it.

rhis public consciousness “has
become the rule rather than the
exception,” Kuralt said, because
people have come to realize that
“one man or one woman can make
all the difference.” He cited the
example of Ralph Nader starting
ihe consumer movement virtually
on his own with his book Unsafe
at Any Speed. He said the book
Silent Spring began the ecology
movement in a like manner

Kuralt said the past 10 years

However, he said, journalists

have “no time for a calm back-
ward glance, they are always look-
ing to the future.” Therefore the
news is always “crisis-ridden,” he
said

Life is not crisis-ridden, he said.
It is Kuralt’s job to cover life. As
he said “It is my duty to make
sure no swimming pig goes unre
marked.”

Kuralt said he was under in-
struction that if he ever stumbled
upon a “real story I should find a
real reporter.” The big stories? “I
have missed them all,” he said. He
was in a gas station in Alaska
when Nixon resigned and in a la
trine in Vietnam when he learned
(three days late) that
landed on the moon.

But he has caught all the little
stories, like “worm-grunting” in
Sopchopee, Fla. Not that the citi
zens of Sopchopee thought worm
grunting was a small story. In fact
one citizen said when the CBS
film crew came to Sopchopee, ac
cording to Kuralt, “I knew you
guys would show up sooner or
later.”

Pratt money
being spent
for raises’ aid

by WILLIAM H, EDMISTEN

W&L stil does not have access
to the principal of John Pratt’s
nearly $12 million bequest made
last year, according to Treasurer
James W. Whitehead.

But he said the university does
have “authority for direction of
the principal.” The 60-part invest-
ment portfolio “is getting active
investment attention at all times”
he said and the contents of the
portfolio change from day to day.

Assistant Treasurer Louis V.
Snyder said W&L has received
$686,000 in earnings from the

principal since the bequest was
made. In accordance with Pratt’s
will, the W&L Board of Trustees
appropriated $450,000 to increase
faculty salaries and $100,000 for
scholarships and financial aid for
this academic year, Whitehead
said.

Dean of the College William J.
Watt said he didn’t know the
average salary increase of a pro-
fessor and information about in-
dividual salaries is confidential.

Dean of Students Lewis G. John
said the Pratt money gave W&L’s
financial aide program “a shot in
the arm.” He said W&L was “able
to meet all the needs of those
who applied and were accepted

. which otherwise we wouldn’t
have been able to do.”

Pratt requested, but did not
exact in his will, that W&L use
the funds within 25 years after his
death. Whitehead said the Board
of Trustees is now studying “the
unlimited considerations that wi!l
have to be weighed” with regard
to spending the principal.

The dispersion of the near $12
million principal was delayed b
an niece of Pratt’s who conteste ]
the will but who eventually settled
out of court. Now the dispersio:
of the money could go forward
any day, according to Whitehead

THE RING-TUM PHi

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, March 24, 1977

What?

early in the Fall term | proposed a reorganizational scheme
for the University based on the interrelatedness of the various
academic disciplines. No one took it too seriously.

In retrospect | see that my plan, while perhaps making
sense as far as it went, was an attack on the symptoms of the
underlying problem and not on the problem itself.

The problem? The failure of this University to encourage
and develop independent and creative thinking.

No mere reshuffling of departments is going to strike at the
root of this problem.

What are the roots of this problem? Where do they lie?
They extend deep into man’s consciousness and back into his
past. The problem stems from the very ways we think about
things, modes of thought that are so old and comfortable and
familiar that we can no longer see them for what they are—
intellectual tools with limited application—but instead let
them define our world for us.

These modes of thought are so deeply imbedded that it’s
very difficult to recognize them, identify them, see them in
anything but their own context. The very composition of this
essay is being shaped by the kind of thinking I’ve been taught
to do since day one, and any sort of departure from these
traditional modes is viewed at best as eccentricity; if the
departure is radical enough, as insanity.

We are locked into narrow channels of rationality which
prevent us from seeing any other ways of thinking and even
irom seeing that there could even be other ways of thinking.
\ll of this must sound abstract and highflown, but it is really
vital and basic if we are genuinely concerned with with
becoming “educated.”

What are some of these self-limiting ways of thinking I
seem so worried about? Good question...one of them is
called subject-object dualism. This mode of thought presumes
that there exists an unbridgable gap between oneself and the
rest of the world. Most of our thinking about reality is based
on this distinction, a distinction which itself has no “objective”
validity. How can a subject be objective? Objectified? Why
should he be? The great body of scientific knowledge, and the
scientific. method itself—empiricism—grows out of this mania
for “objectivity.” This attitude pervades more than just
science, however, In all disciplines we are taught to examine
things according to how they have been done by others in the
past. We study the methods for doing things but not the rea-
son; we are handed a set of conclusions without questioning
the steps leading to those conclusions.

There is much, much more to all this. All I ask is that we
begin to think about the way we think. To broaden the base
of our thinking would be a giant step towards gaining the
education we all came here for.

Pot

Not since the Great Lexington Spinners War of 1976 have
“o many become so aroused over so little. The personal feei-
ing of this writer is that if there is any place in the world
where he would least like to smoke dope, the freshman dormi
tory is it. But that is not the issue in this case. Some cofisider
the issue to be one of principle, others think it one of harass-
ment, still others worry about matters of law and some just
like to argue. From here, it looks like the central issue is that

RDI.

there is an issue,

The E.C. has scheduled a student body meeting for the
first week after the break to discuss the new Student Control
Committee rules on smoking marihuana in the dorms, The
meeting is to be held in Lee Chapel so there will be enough
room for the large number of people who seem to have strong
views on the subject, Now, just as in the Spinners War, we
at least have a chance to temporarily squelch rampant rumors
of widespread student apathy. The main problems with the
C's arrangements are that the meeting should he located
in the Cockpit and that they neglected to announce who's

buying the papers. Ea

The Ring-tum Phi Survey

By GARY HALEY

This week, as promised, the
Ring-tum Phi Survey moved down
the road to Sweet Briar College.
Here, as at Mary Baldwn College,
a representative sample of the
student body was surveyed con-
fidentially to discern attitudes,
opinions, and experiences of the
ladies from the other side of
Route 60.

Sweet Briar, probably more
than any other area school, has
long suffered from stereo-typing
by outside observers. Everyone
knows that all the girls at SBC
ride horses, have nice cars, have
plenty of money, and don’t always
have sweet dispositions. I found
this not to be fully true: they
don’t all ride horses, they don’t
all have cars, and they don’t all
have plenty of money. Three out
of four is not bad!

The text of this week’s survey
centers around the theme of how
these SBC students judge others
and how they actually view them-
selves. One of the first questions
dealing with how they view them-
selves was ‘“Whait do you consider
your best personal talent?” Be-
lieve it or not, all the answers
were printable. The actual replies
were as varied as individual per-
sonalities, but by far the most
popular reply dealt with their
gift of gab, conversational abili-
ties, and ease in getting along
with others (40 percent). The next
most common answer dealt with

atheletic ability, specifically out-
door sports such as riding horses
(20 per cent). This was followed
by 10 per cent who felt they had
no one particular best talent and
10 per cent who felt their best
personal talent was their ability
to draw, paint, sculpt, ete. The
remaining percentiles were oc-
cupied by ideas such as work
motivation, voice quality, leader-
ship abilities, and generosity.

Following up on this personal
talents idea, I asked the ladies,
“What can you brag about to
your friends?” A full 43 per cent
answered that they choose not to
brag to anyone at anytime. Fol-
lowing this, 16 per cent brag
about their “weekend husbands.”
Another 15 per cent brag about
their musical talents, especially
their voices. Beyond this 10 per
cent brag about their G.P.A.s and
10 per cent brag about their
artistic abilities. Filling out the
remaining percentages are brags
about atheletic abilities, riding,
dancing, clothes, cooking, and
even quitting smoking.

Next I asked the girls what
impressed them, particularly per-
taining to guys. The overwhelm-
ing answer pertained to the per-
sonality of the guy in question
(46 per cent). The distant and
trailing replies: 13 per cent felt
that honesty was the most im-
pressive characteristic in a guy;
this was followed by good looks
(nine per cent). Another nine per

per cent were impressed most
when a guy did not “try to get
me in bed.”

Finally, I asked these lovelies
of SBC to what degree several
basic characteristic of guys affect-
ed their dating preferences. There
was a list of ten basic criteria.
Only one of these characteristics
affected their preferences “a lot.”
This was personality. All of those
surveyed replied that the person-
ality of a guy affects their pre-
ferences a lot. This was followed
by “overall appearance” and “in-
tellect” which affected their pre-

ferences a lot-to-some. This was
rather closely followed by ‘sex
appeal” and believe it or not, beer
drinkers, “weight.” Items that
turned out to effect preferences
only “a little’ were “hometown,”
“fraternity,” and “wealth.” It
would seem that the old rumors
about fraternal differentiation of
dating preferences and the ideas
of “preferred houses” is not all
that prevalent any more. Some
other items that had no affect on
dating preferences were clothes,
height, “swilling capacity” and
“gatoring techniques.”

Bugliosi discusses
Manson, Kennedy

by DAVID W. TALLEY, JR.

Last Wednesday, Vincent Bug-
liosi, the third speaker in the Con-
tact series, spoke about his book,
Helter Skelter, and the assassina-
tion of Robert Kennedy. Address-
ing a full house in Lee Chapel,
which was very receptive, Bug-
liosi did a fine job of summarizing

Helter Skelter, the story of the’

Charles Manson murders. Manson
and four members of his “family”
were tried for killing seven peo-
ple, collectively termed the Tate-
LaBianca murders. Deputy D. A.
Bugliosi succeeded in obtaining

Charles Fletcher Murray:
the shadow man knows all

By M. GRAY COLEMAN

On every college campus, there
is an individual who serves as the
general “trouble-shooter.”. W&L
is extremely lucky to have such
a person, a man who handles un-
ruly freshmen, distempered dogs,
outraged deans, and Old George
equally well. You know, there are
many students who are not fa-
miliar with the name Charles
Fletcher Murray, University Proc-
tor and Director of University
Security. But just say the name
Murph .. . freshmen subside,
deans put away their aspirin bot-
tles for an hour, and life goes on
here on the hill.

In response to the question,
“What does the Proctor do?’’, one
faculty member replied, “Every-
thing.” Yet, Murph was orginally
hired in the late 1950's with a
particular duty in mind. At that
time, the faculty decided to crack
down on the rising unruly con-
duct (particularly among fraterni-
ties). City police had begun to
threaten that, unless the school
took steps, they would have to
intervene in our affairs (reluct-
antly, of course). Mr. Murray,
then a city policeman himself, de-
cided to take on the job at W&L
and try his hand at friendly dis-
cipline.

The prospects for this were
bleak, though. When word got out
that one of “Lexington’s finest”
was actually coming on campus to
police student behavior, misgiv-
ings ran high. But, slowly, Murph
established a rapport with the en-
tire Washington and Lee com-
munity that others will only hope
to attain. From his office in
Doremus Gymnasium, he went out
every day at a long job—in fact,
even today at the writing of this
story, it was impossible for three
administrators to tell the Phi
exactly how many hours Murph
does put in. There are the usual
daytime hours, but a lot of his
work involves weekend evenings,
holidays, ad infinitum,

For those of you with an auto,
the name of Murph takes on a
special significance. Yes, the
“shadow man” is the one who
leaves those little pink slips all
over campus—an  unenviable
honor at best. But it may be of
some consolation to learn that
some of the worst offenders have
not been students at all. The
Proctor can, and does, ticket fac
ulty, and will even suggest to
Dean John which ones need a good
“talking to” concerning car eti-
quette,

Also, he has always had an un-
canny sense of knowing what's in
all our minds before we can put
our ideas into action. The recent
painting of “Old George” will
serve as an example of this. The
individuals in question had waited
until late, and were industriously
painting away when a hazy pres

ence was spotted, chuckling up
at them from the ground. “Is that
you, Murph?” “Yep.” But only
waiting to make sure the boys
didn’t hurt themselves—he knew
all along that they were going to
take care of “Old George’s” re-
painting... He knows us all too,
too well.

As one dean commented, “What
amazes me is how well he is able
to track down culprits, whether
townie thieves during vacations or
rowdies in fraternity parties.” In-
deed, Murph’s batting average
shadows that he recovers the
goods or discovers the guilty party
well over half the time. And he,
all by himself, is the reason fra-
ternities are tolerated as much as
they are by the city cops. It is
noise down at parties—acting as
a liaison to head things off be-

LETTERS TO

Dear Editor:

Most educators consider diver-
sity within the student body to be
a distinct advantage for all who
participate in the academic com-
munity. As a member of the ad-
missions committee, I recently
completed a review of financial
need and merit scholarship ap-
plicants. Based on the efforts of
administrators, alumni, and stu-
dents, the numbers and quality of
applicants represent a dramatic
improvement over previous years.
Many schools comparable to W&L
are actively pursuing these stu-
dents.

Over the past weekend many of
the black student applicants visit-
ing the campus attended the Black
Awareness Ball. The ball was a
success in all dimensions except
one—the absence of faculty and
white students. For those out-
spoken critics of black student
isolation, the invitation was ex-
tended to all, the isolation was
never more obvious than on Satur-
day night, the administration was
well represented. Where were
you? In particular, the absence of
student leaders and faculty was
disappointing. Beyond the nega-
tive impact on our black student
body and perspective students,
you missed a good time. “A Night
at the Copa” was excellent all the
way. If we want diversity in the
W&L community, let's promote
it and support it.

This Thursday and Friday the
merit scholarship applicants will
be visiting our campus. Again, the
administrators, alumni, and stu-
dents have worked hard to
identify and to bring these tal
ented young people here. To a
large degree their choice of W&L
will depend upon their interviews
with professors and most of all,
their contaets with the students
It is important that all of us not

Murph who asks you to keep the
fore the police find it necessary
to raid.

When all is said and done, a
straw poll of people would call
him “The indispensible man.” A
man who handles everything he
touches with quiet competence, he
is still largely unseen. But, the
next time you see him moving
through the bushes at your. fra-
ternity house during a party,
remember that he’s there to head
off a thief, or some other very
real theft. And then you join
the ranks of the grateful—like the
new professor who’s finally figur-
ed out the parking system or
the freshman he helped to win a
snowball fight. Our proctor —
Excedrin intake will be on the
rise in Washington Hall if he ever
leaves.

THE EDUTOR

only make them feel welcome but
stimulate their interest in and
enthusiasm for what W&L can
offer them.

The University’s progress over
the past ten years is remarkable,
representing the best efforts of
many dedicated individuals. In
seeking to attract and to main-
tain a diverse student body of
qualified young men, we need the
best efforts of student and faculty
now.

Dear Sir:

One of the duties of the Student
Control Committee is to enforce
the University policy concerning
marijuana in the dorms. The Uni-
versity, for whatever reasons,
actively prohibits marijuana in
the dormitories. The strict state-
ment of policy issued March 8 by
the Committee has a dual purpose.
First, to stop persons from smok-
ing marijuana in the dorms, and
second, to be fair in our means
of accomplishing this task.

As Chairman of the Committee,
! spoke to the freshman class dur-
ing their orientation at Natural
Bridge. One of the few points that
| stressed was the University
policy concerning pot in the
dorms. I did not state a specific
penalty at the time. At the be
ginning of January, the Commit
lee heard its first two cases jn.
volving persons smoking pot in
the dorms, and assessed to them
the same penalty that last year’s
committee had awarded in their
first cases. In an effort to be sure
that the freshmen were aware of
the University policy concerning
marijuana in the dorms, 1, repre.
senting the Committee, wrote a
letter to the Ring-tum Phi stating
that we had penalized two fresh
men for smoking pot in the dorms

(Continued on page 4,

convictions and the death penalty
for all five defendants. The Su-
preme Court later declared the
death penalty unconstitutional, so
the sentences were commuted to
life imprisonment.

Although it was apparent from
the questions that much of the
audience had not read Helter
Skelter, some of the inquiries
proved interesting. Because of the
sentence reduction to life impri-
sonment, the Tate-LaBianca kill-
ers are eligible to apply for parole
next year. With this in mind, the
question was raised of whether
Bugliosi’s life style would signifi-
cantly change when Manson and
his followers were paroled. “Not
‘eally,” he replied. “I don’t have
any great fear of the Manson fam-
ily. I did have a bodyguard for
about a year and a half, but
they're not going to get out for a
great many more years.” In re-
sponse to a question on the cur-
rent status of the “family,” Bug-
liosi reported that nearly every
hard core member was behind
bars and “for all intensive pur-
poses, the Manson family has been
decimated.”

One other interesting area
prompted by an inquiry dealt with
Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme, who
was the acting head of the “fam-
ily” after Manson’s arrest, and the
would-be assassin of President
Ford. “I had said several times
that Squeaky was the head of the
Manson family in Manson’s ab-
sense, that she was very danger-
ous, and that she should be watch-
ed and was not being watched.
Then the President comes to town
(Sacremento), and no one is watch-
ing Squeaky or the family. And, in
addition to that, Squeaky is wear-
ing a red robe and a red cape,
walks right up and no one says
‘Boo.”’ Now, here’s the Secret
Service, who are supposed to be
guarding the President, and she
walks right up wearing a red robe
and red cape. They should have
said, ‘Now who is this person?’ It’s
unbelievable that they would per-
mit someone like Squeaky From-
me to get within two feet of the
President. And there were some
members of the press who were
there and who recognized her be-
cause they had covered the Man-
son case in L.A., and they said:
: “Wonder what Squeaky’s doing

ere,’ ”

Later, a reception was held in
Fairfax Lounge, where Bugliosi
discussed the RFK assassination.
The big problem deals with the
possibility of a second gun (other
than Sirhan’s). Ballistics experts
do not agree on whether the bul-
lets recovered are from Sirhan’s
gun, could be from Sirhan’s gun,
or are not from Sirhan’s gun.
There is another problem with the
number of shots fired. Sirhan had
an eight-shot pistol, and did not
have time to reload and fire again
once those eight shots were fired.
There is a possibility of 12-14 bul-
let holes, but there is now no way
to check that out since much of
the evidence, including a partition
containing several possible bullet
holes, was destroyed, as were var-
lous other records concerning the
ease, There may be one possible
means for clearing up the ques
tion of how many shots were fir-
ed. Although no film of the shoot
ing was made, an audio tape was
running at the time. This tape,
which was turned over to the FBI,
could answer the question simply
by listening and counting the
shots. For some reason, the tape
has been kept under wraps.

One thing which Bugliosi em-
phasized several times was the
beauty of W&L and Virginia, and
the good reputation that W&L has.
He said that if his son considers
a college outside of California, he
will recommend Washington and
Lee

Generals beat Kutztown,
prepare for Navy invasion

by BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s 24-5 la-
crosse romp over Kutztown State
Saturday really doesn’t make
much sense,

Here’s a team which is notori-
ous for starting every season as if
the first month of the schedule
didn’t matter, a team which seems
not to believe in scoring early and
often in any game, a team which
rarely exhibits an ability to put
an opponent away when such an
opportunity presents itself.

All the Generals did to discred-
it the legend of the “W&L slow
start” was to explode for five
goals within 2:58 of the game’s
outset, then reel off 12 tallies in
succession later in the contest to
send the Golden Bears back to
Pennsylvania wondering just what
had hit them.

“Just what the doctor ordered,”
said a smiling Jack Emmer to his
players after the game. “We went
out there loose, got things going
early, and made it a very enjoy-
able afternoon for ourselves.”

Emmer had voiced some con-
cern prior to the game that the
Generals had “taken a step back-
wards” in their outings with Vir-
ginia Tech and Mount Washing-
ton, and that the team needed to
get some momentum going in its
final week of action before exams,

The momentum began building
during tahe Generals’ game-open-
ing burst. Sophomore attackman
Chris Kearney turned the Wilson
Field crowd on with a pair of
goals just 12 seconds apart in the
opening minute, the first coming
on a spectacular one-hand bounce
shot from the right side of the
cage.

After midfielder Jay Sindler
worked free on an isolation play
for the third W&L tally, Johnny
Black took a Kearney feed and
scored from five yards out, then
teamed with Jack Dudley on a
give-and-go play to complete the
Generals’ stunning blitz.

After Kutztown cut the W&L
lead to four, 6-2, late in the quar-
ter, the Generals conducted a les-
son on the finer points of offen-
sive lacrosse. Winning nearly
every face off and keeping play in
their attack zone most of the time,
W&L reeled off 12 goals over the
next 28 minutes, including seven
in a near-perfect second quarter
in showing that they’re capable of
playing good lacrosse before April
1

One of the more pleasant as-
pects of the rout was W&L’s new-
found ability to capitalize on op-
position penalties. After experi-
encing some problems with the
man-up offense in the first three
games, W&L struck for five extra
man goals, including four during
the 12-goal run, against Kutztown.

“You might say we got our act
together on the EMO (extra man
offense), said co-captain Dudley,
who got a pair of goals off the
man-up situations. “We're starting
to work better as a unit, and I
know we'll keep improving thro-
ughout the year.”

Dudley and sophomore attack-
man Jeff Fritz led a 14-man par-
ade to the scorebook with three
goals apiece, while six W&L play-
ers ~~ Kearney, Sindler, Black and
freshmen Mike Schuler, Bill Ma-
hon, and Scott MecLam — each

scored twice. Kearney added four
assists, while Fritz and Charlie
Stieff contributed two assists
each.

John Greiner paced Kutztown,
0-1, with two goals.

W&L again received strong play
from its goalies. Charlie Brown
recorded nine saves in the first 30
minutes, while freshman Bob Cle-
ments, who saw some duty as a
faceoff specialist in the first half,
stopped ten shots after intermis-
sion.

Kutztown’s Mike Moralles kept
things from being worse for the
Golden Bears, if that’s possible,
with 17 saves.

* oh a

It might not match up to the
Maryland-Johns Hopkins rivalry,
or even that between Washington
and Lee and Virginia, but the la-
crosse feud that has developed be-
tween the Generals and the Naval
Academy is now recognized as one
of the more~spirited matchups in
all of college lacrosse.

Even though the two teams met
for the first time just four years
ago, players on both squads re-
gard the W&L-Navy game as one
of the biggest on their schedules.

The Generals hold the edge in
the series, 3-2, but the Midship-
men have won the last two meet-
ings, including last year’s 8-7
squeaker at Annapolis, which
went Navy’s way on a man-up goal
in the final 30 seconds.

Among the three W&L wins are
a pair of victories in NCAA tour-
nament quarterfinal games. The
Generals won what many call “the
most thrilling game ever played
on Wilson Field’ ’in the 1973 tour-
nament, 14-13, when midfielder
Chip Tompkins scored in the se-
cond sudden death overtime per-

iod. The following year, after
having beaten Navy 13-10 during
the regular season behind five
goals and four assists by attack-
man Dave Warfield, W&L again
ended the Middies’ championship
hopes, 11-9, as Warfield collected
four goals and two assists.

The only lopsided game in the
series came in 1975, when mid-
fielder Bob DeSimone ran through
the W&L defense for seven goals
in leading Navy to a 14-8 win. De-
Simone, a first-team All-American
as a sophomore that year, has
since taken his talents to Johns
Hopkins.

Naturally, part of the spark that
has fueled the rivalry is the pre-
sence of former W&L coach Dick
Szlasa as the Middies’ mentor.
Szlasa, the man responsible for
the start of the Generals’ rise to
lacrosse promience in the late
1960's, left Lexington after the
1972 season to take the head job
at Navy.

Since moving to Annapolis, Sz-
lasa has taken his team to the
NCAA tournament each season,
though Navy has not won the na-
tional title under him. The Mid-
dies got to the 1975 finals, but
were thrashed by Maryland, 20-13.

This will be the first time that
Szlasa has looked at a W&L team
that does not have any of his re-
cruits playing. Last year’s gradu-
ates were the last bunch Szlasa
brought to Lexington, the final
group able to get any satisfaction
out of beating the man who had
recruited them.

In a mild upset, Navy dropped
its opener to Rutgers Saturday,
9-7. The Middies played college di-
vision power Washington College
yesterday before making the trip
to Lexington.

Baseball Generals
win two, lose two

The 1977 W&L baseball Gen-
erals opened the new season with
a .500 week, defeating Virginia
Wesleyan 5-3, losing to Lock
Haven State 41, and splitting a
doubleheader with West Virginia
Tech, winning 4-1, and losing 2-0.
It's a three game week for the
diamond nine as they travel to
Bridgewater College for an ODAC
doubleheader on Tuesday, and
host Oneonta State of New York
at 3:00 p.m. on Friday.

Senior co-captain Dan West-
brook pitched the Generals to
their first win of the year allow-
ing six Va. Wesleyan hits, while
giving up only one earned run.
The W&L batsmen were led by
senior designated hitter Mickey
Clary with two hits and three
RBI's. Shortstop Ted Hissey and
centerfielder Rich Wiles each had
a pair of hits.

Base running errors hurt the
Generals in the Lock Haven set-
back, and freshman Chip Childs
suffered his first loss of the year
in a game which just as easily
could have gone the other way
Wiles scored the only W&L run
in the eighth.

After losing the first game to

W.Va. Tech on Saturday, the Gen-
erals came back to take the night-
cap 41 behind the pitching of
freshman Vie Shepherd who al-

Golfers’ week ends
with split record

by JOHN BERLEY

On Friday, March 11, the W&L
golf team went into its first match
against the team of Averrett Col-
lege, from Martinsville, Va. The
conditions for this match were
excellent for W&L, the home
course at Lexington Country Club
was in fair shape after the devas-
tating winter and the team’s gen-
eral attitude was tremendous, for
they are anticipating a great year.
Needless to say, things were go-
ing well for the team all the way
around and the first match proved
it. The W&L men, had the advan-
tage that the home course can
bring, but showed that they were
superior to even this advantage
and handily took the match by
close to 41 strokes.

After another week of practice
the team went off to Bedford, Va.,
for a match against the team of
Lynchburg College. The name of
the course was Ivy Hill, a name
which seems to connote ease, but
the actual conditions were far
from easy. Talking to Coach Les-
lie, head of the team, he indicated
that the course was very difficult
and that the match could come
down to within a few strokes. He
also indicated that the Lynchburg
team had a definite home advant-
age for the course was difficult
and the opposition has practiced
on it every day. Team captain
Jerry Maatman also felt that the
match would be trying, pointing
out that the course was, in his
estimation, one of the hardest in
Virginia. So it was on Saint Pat-
rick’s day that the team headed
for Bedford and one of the har-
dest matches of the season. Oh
yes, one minor oversight, the Lyn-
chburg team is excellent, which
added to the overall difficulty in
playing this match.

The course itself is very differ-

ent from most, for the front nine
is like playing in a cow pasture
with little or no flat area on any
of the rather broad fairways mak-
ing the second shots difficult, and
hills so high that they very effec-
tively hid most of the greens. The
back nine was another story all
together. It still had its share of
rolling Virginia hills but this time
the fairways were so tight that to
get an effective drive off the tee
you had to hook the ball to get it
around the dog legs. Also, any-
thing short of a perfect shot would
have you in a beautiful stand of
Virginia Pines or a_ babbling
brook. The greens were in good
shape, however, and as team mem-

Run-off climaxes battle

and voted for the amendment, but
Pltii Delta Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha
and Sigma Nu all switched to the
negative column, killing the eligi-
bility amendment and removing
the Red Square split that existed
the night before.

The amendment being offered
would have allowed any student
to run for the office of IFC presi-
dent. As the constitution reads
now, only rising seniors may seek
the post.

Only nine houses signed the
petition circulated by Jones’s
backers before the Wednesday
night meeting. The petition asked
Robinson to call a meeting of the
IFC, take a vote on the eligibility
amendment, then adjourn and call
another meeting immediately. The
IFC constitution says that any
amendment must be ratified by a
two-thirds vote of the 15 houses at
two successive meetings.

Fight houses voted for the
change on Tuesday night, and af-
ter the meeting Peter Quinn of
the SPE house and Howdy Knipp
of Delta Tau Delta said that they
would probably vote for the
amendment it it were offered
again. SPE did change on the sec-
ond, but the Delt house retained
its negative vote. Even though KA
switched as well the three Red
Square votes that changed were
enough to prevent the change.

Knipp said before the Wednes-
day meeting that he had started
his race for IFC vice-president
hoping he could do some good for
the frats. But he added that he
did not like having to take sides
and was having second thoughts
about the election and the amend-
ment.

Knipp still allowed his name to
be placed in nomination again, as
did KA Carter Greer. Greer had
said earlier he hoped he would be
the compromise candidate chosen
by the non-Red Square houses, but
added that he did not enjoy the
prospect of splitting the frater-
nities by running one faction
against another.

Greer Was nominated by his
frat brother, George Griffin, but

Griffin indicated afterward that
the move was a favor to Greer and
that he planned to support Mattes-
ky. He said he talked to several
people Tuesday night about nomi-
nating a candidate all the non-Red
Square houses could get behind
and Mattesky was the one they
chose.

Mattesky said after his nomina-
tion, “I hadn’t planned on running
to begin with. I didn’t know, being
a journalist, whether I.wanted to
get involved in administrative
matters.” He added, “I guess it
wasn’t too hard to talk me into it.”

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

and that we would increase the
penalty, if necessary, to enforce
the University policy. Another
case was brought before the Com-
mittee, and we handled it in the
same manner as the previous two.
About a month later, three more
cases were turned into the Com-
mittee, and in questioning the
freshmen involved, we found that
they had been aware of the Uni-
versity’s policy, and that they had
all either read or heard about
the letter I wrote to the Phi. It
was clear to the Committee that
our previous efforts to stop mari-
juana smoking in the dorms had
been ineffective.

Thus, in an effort to be fair
by making sure all dormitory resi-
dents knew of the new policy, we
issued the statement to all the
counselors so that they could
post it in their dorm sections.
Further, to accomplish our pur-
pose of stopping marijuana smok-
ing in the dorms, we issued a
policy incorporating penalties that
we felt would serve as a deterrent.

said. “We are just trying to be

realistic,” said Cleary. He said he

thought the stiffer marijuana pen-

alties would inhibit smoking in

the dorms so they don’t become a

drug haven.

Senior representative Paul Lar-
kin said the thing that disturbed
him about the Student Control ae-
tion is that they imposed less
strict penalties on W&L students
who were charged with assulting a
woman at one of the local col-
leges.

Cleary said he thought that case
was a turning point of the com-
mittee. Thereafter the committee
was much more strict in dealing
out penalties, he said.

The case involved two members
of SAE charged with spraying a
chemical fire extinguisher in the
face of a 65-year-old housemother
at Hollins, aceording to members
of Student Control. The penalty
handed down in that case was
lighter than the new minimum
penalties for smoking pot in the
dorms.

The new Student Control pen-
alties are a $50 fine, two weeks
social probation and a letter to
the offender's parents.

E.C. President-elect Jim Under-
hill said he did not think the issue
fell under the jurisdiction of the
E.C. but Vice-President-eleet
George Griffin moved that the
committee invite members of Stu-
dent Control to a student body
meeting in Lee Chapel after the
Spring break to discuss the prob-
lem. Griffin’s motion passed 8-2.

CAR TAGS

All students who have motor
vehicles at Washington and Lee
and who purchased local tags in
March or April of 1976 are re-
minded of the requirement to
purchase new tags prior to the
expiration of the ones currently
displayed.

A student whose local address
is within the city limits of Lex
ington is required to purchase a
decal from the City Treasurer's
Office at the Lexington City Hall
on East Washington Street. These
decals, which cost $10.00 each, are
good for a twelve-month period
from the date of purchase.

A student whose local residence
is in Rockbridge County is to pur-
chase his decal at the County
Treasurer's Office, located in the
County Court House Building on
Main St. All county tags, which
also cost $10.00, expire on Apri!
15 each year. State registration
papers for the automobile are re
quired at the time of purchase.

The only students exempt from
these licensing requirements are
Virginia residents who already dis-
play current local tags from a city
or county in the Commonwealth
of Virginia.

it is just something that we have
done for years. We do not go up
on the campus unless we are

ficial of the school or the pro-
perty.”

However the police chief would
not comment when asked about
the possibilities of a ‘drug bust’
in the dormitories this year. He
also. withheld comment when
queried about the likelihood of a
drug investigation being conduct-
ed at this time.

Noell was reassuring in his an-
swer to the question of whether
the police would be summoned if
the Administration felt the drug
situation in the dorms was bad:
“T really don’t know. I’m not try-
ing to evade or avoid that ques-
tion, but I just haven’t confronted
that as a matter that I was going
to have to make a decision on be-
cause I really have not concluded
that we’ve got that kind of situa-
tion now nor in the forseeable fu-
ture. I don’t believe I would be in-
clined, as a matter of first in
stance, to handle it that way; |

could do something about it.”

were good to excellent and it
seemed that the six members of
the team were off to great starts.
Th Lynchburg team on the other
hand-had some fine tee shots by
the team leaders but the rest of
the team was short or in the

the front nine W&L was up by one

and the Lynchburg team had some

Uvnehburg’s familiarity with the

Sunny Springs weekend

by Dee Dee Warren

There was a lot of energy
shown onstage Friday night in
Doremus Gym, perhaps more
than a_ sleepy Southern
university like W&L was able to
take.

From the vigorous
proselytization of Chris Rush
for the reform of marijuana
laws to the tight vocals of
Orleans, the stage was alive
with electronic and human

Boxwood
gift

by Rex Nyquist

Students going to class
Monday morning were greeted
with the sight of several English
boxwoods being placed near
Newcombe Hall. The boxwoods
— eighty in all — were given to
the university by the late
Wilmer S. Poinor, Jr., of Bir-
mingham, Alabama.

Mr. Poinor, whose son John is
a 1962 graduate of Washington
and Lee, was an avid boxwood
collector and had given three
previous gifts to the college.

In 1972 he gave the school
thirty-two boxwoods he had
purchased from a nursery in
Wytheville, Virginia. Two years
later he bought some property
in Floyd, Virginia that had a
number of boxwoods on it. He
gave the university fifty-one
bushes in 1974 and forty-eight in
1975. The first group was placed
near the President’s house and
the freshmen dorms, while the
third group went largely near
Parmly Hall.

Mr. Poinor had planned to
give Washington and Lee eighty
remaining boxwoods in similar
installments, but because of his
death the university agreed to
accept them all at once.

Frank Parsons, assistant to
the President, said . the
university is glad to have the
boxwoods. He noted a few
disadvantages to the gift,
though. One is that the
university has to pay the cost of

(continued on page 2)

energy, most of it wasted with
only 1300 people present.

Rush, a former Lampoon
writer, whose routine was
strangely reminiscent of the
National Lampoon travelling
show here last year, highlighted
the incongruities of both the law
and the tests, scientific or not,
used to support those laws. The
topic was brought up early in
the routine of the self-confessed
evangelist for the National
Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws.

The validity of his ob-
servations on society was often
clouded by the method of
presentation. Who can ap-
preciate cynicism when it is
surrounded by imprecations of
a nature which would embarass
a longshoreman (more) for a
lack of style and content than
for effort.

In a packed Doremus
Gymnasium Tuesday night,
Contact committeeman Rob
Sult introduced Olympian
Decathlon gold medalist Bruce
Jenner to a crowd which
greeted him with an ovation
second only to that given for his
wife Christie.

It seemed predestined that
Christie, dressed in a white
satin silk shirt and tight fitting
black pants, would be a main
feature of the evening. Her
indentity unknown to the crowd,
she was ushered in and seated
to the tune of catcalls and
whistles prior to Bruce’s ap-
pearance. After Jenner let it be
known his wife was there and
introduced her, the crowd went
wild. When the roar died down
Jenner said, “Judging from the
ovation you gave my wife, it
looks like it’s been a long year
for you guys.”’

Jenner talked for ap-
proximately an hour con-
centrating on his philosophy for
succeeding in sports, which he
believes carries over into the
everyday world. He said that
life, just like sports, is very
competitive and the only way to
succeed is to believe with your
whole heart in what you are
doing.

opposed to a recommendation
by Dr. Jay D. Cook that in-
dependent exams be abolished.

Sandy Stradtman, vice
president of the E. C., said Cook
made his recommendation at a
faculty meeting. Cook, a
professor of accounting, said
that information is getting out
before the end of exam periods
and that students are not taking
their exams in the room
assigned to them, according to
Stradtman.

Stradtman said the faculty
would vote on Cook’s proposal
“in the next week.” If the
faculty says ‘no more in-
dependent exams,’ there will be
no more independent exams,
said Stradtman. If independent
exams are abolished students
will have to take exams during
assigned periods.

Rather than take away the
privilege and convenience of
independent exams for the
majority who don’t cheat,
Stradtman recommended that
the faculty become more in-
volved in questions of honor. He
said the faculty should be
responsible for making sure
students understand they must
take exams in assigned rooms,
and should also make sure their
students know what constitutes
an honor violation.

Unfortunately, many faculty
members do not know what
constitutes an honor violation,
said Stradtman. In fact the

SAB disappointed
by Doug Dewing

After the debacle which was
Springs Weekend, the Student
Activities Board may be forced
to change the system of con-
certs at Washington and Lee.

Mike Armstrong, co-
chairman of the SAB, said that
the SAB took a bigger beating
during Springs weekend than
they did during Winter Concert.

While the totals are not yet in,
Armstrong said that the picture
looks bad. The entire weekend
cost almost $13,000. The Mar-
velettes on Thursday night cost
$950. Orleans cost $7500, Law
cost $2000 and Chris Rush, the
comedian, cost $800. Income
was estimated at about $3250, or
about 1300 persons at $2.50
apiece.

The SAB had hoped to cover
about half their costs in ticket
sales and were expecting a
large crowd because of the low
ticket price. Armstrong said he
had hoped for about 2,000
spectators.

The only bright spot in the
concert was that attendance
was better than at the Atlanta
Rhythm Section concert during
the winter.

2 THE RING-TUM PHI

SAB

(continued from page 1)

Armstrong said his com-
mittee faces a dilemma on the
matter of future concerts.
“While the students seem to
want to go to concerts, unless
the group is Marshall Tucker or
Earth Wind and Fire, the
students just don’t show.”’

According to Armstrong, the
SAB has very few choices for
the future. Either there should
be no more concerts, concerts
should be held jointly with some
other school, or the whole idea
of concerts should be re-
evaluated and smaller concerts
provided.

There are problems with all
three ideas.

Just dropping concerts would
not work, because of the student
demand for such a social ac-
tivity.

Joint concerts aren’t feasible
either. Every survey Arm-
strong has seen on the subject
shows that W&L students don’t
want to hold a concert with
VMI. A joint concert with one of
the women’s colleges didn’t
strike Armstrong as a good idea
either. First, they don’t have
the kind of money for such
events that W&L has had and
second, there would be conflict
over where a concert would be
held.

The third idea had more
appeal to Armstrong, but he
didn’t know if it would work at
all. That idea was smaller
concerts, with only one artist,
who would do two or more
shows in a very brief period,
almost like nightclub dates. He
suggested having an artist like
Jimmy Buffet come to W&L and
put on two small shows. This
would cost a little more, but
might work.

The .coffee-house circuit
performers, who perform in the
Cockpit in such a_ nightclub
situation, have met many
difficulties and the program has
had little student support.

Armstrong summed the
situation up saying, “To get a
good group, we’ve got to spend
over $10,000. If you only take in
$2,000, you’re hurting.”

YD’s receive award Sunny Springs

(continued from page 1)

by Rex Nyquist

The Washington and Lee
Young Democrats received the
best small-college Democratic
club award at the Virginia
Young Democrat state con-
vention last weekend. The
convention was held at the
Sheraton Red Lion Inn in
Blacksburg.

In addition, three Washington
and Lee Young Democrats, all
freshmen, were elected to state-
wide offices at the convention.

Tony Carli was. elected
Secretary of the Virginia
college Democrats; David

Garner was named Sixth
District College Co-ordinator;
and Glen Washington was
elected Sixth District
Secretary.

Next Thursday, April 28, the
YD’s will host a debate between
Henry Howell and Andrew
Miller, the Virginia guber-
natorial candidates in the
Democratic primary. The
debate will be held in Lee
Chapel at 8 p.m. It will be
moderated by John Jackley, a
senior at Washington and Lee. A
panel consisting of Mel Carrico
of the Roanoke Times, James
Latimer of the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, and Walter
Crockett of Bristol’s TV station
will ask the candidates
questions.

Prior to the debate the Rock-
bridge County Democratic
Committee will hold a dinner at
the Robert E. Lee Episcopal
Church.

E. C. extended an invitation to
new faculty members to meet
with members of the committee
to discuss the issue of honor, but
not a single faculty member
came, said Stradtman.

One member of the audience
thought the faculty’s ignorance
was not confined to matters of
honor. Citing the long waiting
lines at the Commerce School
for finals to be handed out, he
said, ‘‘they have Ph.D.s in
administration, but they don’t
even know how to hand out
exams.”’

The six groups requesting and
receiving funds were the
Student Activities Board,
Washington & Lee ROTC
Rangers, Student Arts Fair,
Cold Check Committee,
lacrosse team pep rally and the
first annual Ring-tum Phi Road
Race.

The SAB requested $2,100 for
parties after the Virginia and
Maryland lacrosse games, and
for a party at the pavilion a
week after the Maryland game.
Mike Armstrong, co-chairman
of the SAB, said _ the
organization could not afford to
pay for the $4,000 worth of
parties coming up in the next
three weeks because the SAB
“took a bigger beating in the
Springs concert than in the
Winter concert.”’

Armstrong said only about
1,300 persons attended the
Springs Weekend concert. The
concert cost about $14,000, he
said, but the small attendance
and other ‘‘circumstances
beyond our control’’ caused the
SAB to lose much more money
than it planned.

Armstrong said about half of
the money could be returned to
the reserve fund if the SAB
makes the expected big profit
on its mid-May ‘‘porn flick.”’ So
the E. C. voted to loan the SAB
the $2,100 until part of it could
be payed back.

The W&L ROTC Rangers
received $1,000 for the purchase
of four canoes. The canoes will
be stored in the ROTC building
and may be used by any
member of the W&L com-
munity.

The E. C. gave $500 to Dan
Scott for a student arts fair. The
fair will run for three days this
Spring. It will stretch from the
collonade to Lee Chapel and will
feature art exhibitions, plays,
mime shows, bands, literature
and even kite-flying, said Scott.

The Cold Check Committee
received $300 to cover the
hundreds of bad checks that
have been written by students
this Spring. Bob Couch, who
came before the E. C. with the
request, said this is an annual
thing and that last year it was
even worse when about 700 cold
checks had to be covered. The
E. C. granted the money from
the reserve fund.

Bill Flesher came before the
committee to request $150 for
beer for the pep rally before the
Virginia lacrosse game. He
eventually received $200, and
vowed he would spend every
cent of it on beer. At $27 a keg,
the pep rally should have over
20 kegs of beer.

The E. C. also gave $150 to
Mike Gallagher for the First
Annual Ring-tum Phi Road
Race. The money will be used to
get publicity for the race, which
will start in Lexington Center,
proceed along 15 miles of road
and end with one lap around
W&L’s outdoor track. Anyone
can enter the race, and the
proceeds will go to the Multiple
Sclerosis Foundation, said
Gallagher. A $2 entry fee will be
required. All participants will
receive a T-shirt and trophies to
the first three places.

off the stage, figuring the
audience would prove a real
challenge.

The concert, now don’t ask
me why a comedian was at a
concert, finally started with
MCA recording artists Law, a
group which contains one
former James Gana member
Jim Fox. Their music was loud,
rowdy, raucous, and
progressivelyy worse.

Many listeners felt the best
material was played during the
first few songs of the set, and I
have to agree. ‘‘Wake up,
Everybody,’’ ‘‘That’s what
Love Can Do For You,’’
“Climbing for Shelter,’ and
“Love is a Dream” led into a
fine instrumental which showed
off the artist at their most
versatile. As far as I could tell,
that should have been the end of
their set.

The sound was a mixture of
powerful rock, with maybe a

Cockpit

Gameroom

Plans

Attendants are now on duty in
the game room of the W&L
Cockpit.

The program, begun last
week, is the idea of manager
Jerry Darrell.

Darrell said the game room
faced the problem of destruc-
tion of the walls and rug due to a
lack of supervision. The at-
tendants will provide’ that
supervision.

In addition, they will provide
a service to the students by
supplying change for the games
and pool cues and balls for those
who want to play pool, which
will be free during Spring term.

Darrell said that the Cockpit
would install ping-pong tables in
the game room this week, and
chess and checker sets soon. He
also hopes’ to _— supply
backgammon sets and darts
sometime in the future. The
attendants would also issue that
equipment.

Spring break was used to
beautify the game room,
Darrell said. A new coat of paint
went on the walls which had
been defaced by shoes and
cigarettes. Darrell also said a
plastic runner would be in-
stalled under the pinball tables
to decrease the number of
cigarette burns in the rug,
which had been installed last
November, and ruined in less
than a year.

Darrell emphasized that the
attendants are there to provide
a Service to students and that he
felt the student center was for
students. There will be few
regulations in the game room
and what regulations there are
will be enforced by students.

Attendants go on duty every
day at 3 p.m. and are on duty
until the Cockpit closes. The
pinball machines will be
available for use for those with
exact change as soon as the
Cockpit opens.

touch too much bass, and a
jazzed-up Jamaican sound, But
after those first few songs, the
music deteriorated to mere
amplification.

The last song of the set could
best be described as a circus,
with the lead singer of Law
moving to the front of the stage
encouraging audience par-
ticipation by passing around a
bottle, reportedly of Jack
Daniels.

Law was contrasted by
Orleans, which presented what
seemed a too short concert
which mixed some surprising
good rockers with acoustic
numbers and a calypso comedy-
satire number called
“Plutonium is Forever.”

Orleans’ lead vocalist was a
clean cut short hair whose
appearance was compared to
Keith Carradine by some
listeners, just not the sort of
person you would think was
worried about Strontium 90,

Despite some __ technical
problems with the lights and the
sound system, he kept part of
the audience on its feet the
whole hour the group played.
The floor of the basketball gym
was bouncing in time to the
people keeping time with the
music, a phenomenon not ap-
parent during the Law section
of the concert.

There was some dancing,
bumping and a lot of swaying on
the floor for most of the set.

Most of the concert was
composed of new material from
their latest album. ‘‘Sweet
Dreamer” seemed to receive
the best reception with much of
the floor crowd up and cheering.
“Dance with Me” and “Still the
One,”’ the singles from their last
album received the _ best
reception overall.

“‘Here in My Memory’”’ a quiet
acoustic piece also gets good
marks for its pleasant, upbeat,
yet contemplative mood. What
that means I liked it, but so did
a lot of other people.

Some of the spectators began
to leave during a blues piece
also from the new album. From
that point on the outflow seemed
“I’m a Bum’’ slowed the out-
pouring and “Still the One’
even brought some people back
in the gym, to hear the last song
of the set.

After that, people began
streaming out the doors, yet
Orleans came back for an en-
core, which not many people
stayed around for. By the end of
the concert, almost half of the
already meager audience had
left.

Probably the most successful
event of the weekend was, as
might be suspected, the grain
party at Zollman’s Pavillion,
Despite a few cases of
overindulgence, a crowd which
might have hit 700 or maybe
even 1000, seemed to enjoy the
sun, the creek and the grain
punch.

From the girl with ‘‘Call Me”
emblazoned on her shirt
(number available on request),
to the sunbathers who parked
their jeeps in the middle of the
creek, a good time seemed to be
had by most all involved.

Perhaps the university should
give up on concerts and just put
the money into parties.

Troub

on the

Move

by Dan Williams

The Washington and Lee
University Theater will produce
a new and unique experience in
the total theater production this
spring in the Old Boiler Room
Theater beneath the Old Main
Street mall, starting May 14 and
continuing through May 21.

The production, keeping with
the age-old theme of the
repretory theater, will include
two different and contrasting
plays by two great American
playwrights. Neil Simon’s
comedy in three acts, ‘“‘Barefoot
in the Park,’’ and Arthur
Miller’s two-act tragedy,
“Death of a Salesman’”’ will be
presented. The two plays will be
produced on alternate nights at
8:00 p.m., with matinees on
May 14 and 15 at 2:00 p.m.

“Barefoot in the Park” will be
directed by Bob Carpentier, a
senior drama major, while
“Death of a Salesman’”’ will be
directed by John Hollinger, also
a senior drama major. Both
Carpentier and Hollinger will be
directing the plays as a
fulfillment of their senior thesis.

Bob Carpentier has directed,
in the past, August Strindberg’s
“The Stronger” and has acted
in such plays as ‘‘The Man of
Mode’”’ and ‘‘Steambath.’’

“Barefoot in the Park’’ will be -

_his first major production.

John Hollinger has directed
“Memory of two Mondays’”’ and
has acted in the ‘‘Fantasticks,”’
“Three Penny Opera,” “‘Cat on
a Hot Tin Roof,” ‘‘Steambath,”’
as well as contributing his
talents to the mime show
produced earlier this year.

venner

The cast of both productions
will be composed of Washington
and Lee University students
and faculty, as well as several
residents of the Lexington area.

For ‘Barefoot in the Park”
the cast will include W&L
students Paul Morella, John
Ellis and Seth Oserin, and
Lexington residents Carol
Phemister, Rose Gordon and
Tom Ziegler.

The cast of “Death of a
Salesman’’ is __ presently
scheduled to include students
Warren Mowry, Ty York, Rich
Allen, Brian Garr, Paul Cella,
Hub Kennedy, Chip Brown,
Barbara Minneg and ¢Art
Bloom; and Lexington residents
Betty Kahn, June Morgan,
Phyllis Davis and Ginger
McNeese.

Tickets for both productions
will go on sale May 9 at the box
office of the Old Boiler Room
Theater. All ticket reservations
must be secured in advance of
all shows. The price of ad-
mission will be free to all
Washington and Lee University
students and faculty, and $1.50
to all others.

Jenner used his own success
story as an illustration. He said
he entered the trials for the ’72

Olympics with no hope of |

qualifying. But as the trials
progressed he saw his name
move up the standings board
and he realized that he could
finish in the top three (thus
qualifying). For the last event
(1500 meters) he believed in
himself so much that he finished
in the top ahead of the pack and
bettered his previous personal
best by 8 seconds. He carried
his illustration up to the ’76
Olympics where he set personal
bests in six of ten events, at-
tributing it all to his strong
belief in himself and what he
was doing.

During the question and
answer session, Jenner said
that there were no longer any
amateur athletes in the world,
not even in the U. S. He believes
that a central sports
organization should be set up,
funded by the government and
corporations to support
amateur athletes while training
for the Olympics. Such a
proposal has been put before
President Carter and Jenner is
disappointed that he hasn’t

acted on it yet.

He also said that contrary to
popular belief, athletes in the
Olympics could care less about
the politics involved. They
regard each other as in-
dividuals, not as part of a
nationality. He considers all his
olympic opponents as ‘‘good,
personal friends, because I
have known them for years.”’

All in all, it made for a light
evening with Jenner flavoring
his talk with numerous sports
jokes. But the anecdote that
drew the largest response was
which his wife said, ‘“You need
more ‘tail’ to get your kite up.”’
Jenner later brought his wife up
to the podium to help field
questions. .

Before leaving the gym to
attend a reception at the Sigma
Chi house, Jenner was
presented a plaque containing
the W&L monogram by track
co-captains John Tucker and
Paul Thompson. Tucker said to
Jenner, ‘‘Since you are now an
honorary member of the team
and we have a meet tomorrow,
we invite you to participate.”
Jenner must have been thinking
to himself, ‘‘Are you kidding
me?’’, when he respectfully
declined.

Jenner shows technique.

   

Former Ambassador to visit

Lord Caradon, former British
ambassador to the United
Nations and widely experienced
diplomat, will be in residence at
Washington and Lee University
next week (April 24-29) for a
public lecture and a number of
private meetings with students.

Lord Caradon will speak on
“Three Danger’ Areas:
Southern Africa, the Middle
East, and Cyprus’’ Monday
evening at 7:30 in the Moot
Court Room of Lewis Hall. The
public is invited without charge.

Lord Caradon, a life peer born
as Hugh Foot, is a career
foreign officer. He entered the
Colonial Office following his
graduation from St. John’s
College, Cambridge, and was
assigned to Palestine and
served in some of the most
troublesome areas there during
the 1930’s. In 1943, he went to
Cyprus as colonial secretary,
and became Governor in 1944.
He then served in Jamaica and
Nigeria, acting as governor for
short periods of time in both
countries. In 1951, he was ap-
pointed captain-general and
governor in chief of Jamaica.

In Nigeria and Jamaica he
played a major part in the
preparation and development of
the first constitutions and in-
ternal self government.

Lord Caradon served as
minister of state for foreign and

 

Commonwealth affairs and
United Kingdom representative
to the UN from 1964 to 1970.
Since then he has undertaken
assignments for the UN in north
Africa and elsewhere, and has
traveled widely in the Middle
East.

During his week at W&L,
Lord Caradon will meet with
classes at the university and
with students during his office
hours.

His visit is sponsored by the
Woodrow Wilson Foundation’s
Visiting Fellows Program,
which fosters better un-
derstanding among students
and teachers through personal
contact.

Washington and Lee is one of
105 colleges, mostly small
liberal arts institutions, which
participate in the Woodrow
Wilson Visiting Fellows
Program.

The Fellows are represen-
tatives of business, journalism,
diplomacy and various other
professions who spend a week
or more on campus, meeting
classes, joining in seminars and
panel discussions, and visiting
informally with students,
teachers and administrators
about their careers and
professions.

The program is sponsored by
the Lilly Foundation.

Jenner gives clinic

by J. Michael Gallagher

The ‘‘world’s greatest
athlete’’ gave a clinic on Wilson
Field Tuesday afternoon for the
benefit of the track team and
the stands filled with adolescent
and preadolescent female
worshippers. A crowd of about
300 turned out to hear Bruce
Jenner give instruction in how
to train for and what technique
to use in the decathlon.

Before the clinic, Jenner
talked a little about the event
itself and how it has affected
him.

“The decathlon is the only
measurable competitive event
of a person’s athletic ability. It
took me 12 years of training to
win it and I have no qualms
about being called ‘‘the world’s
greatest athlete’. Sure if I was
to get out on the gridiron with
OJ Simpson he would bowl me
over. He’s the best at what he
does but that is the only thing he
does. The decathlon covers
everything you could possible
do in any sport. It measures
your ability to run, jump, and
throw. A decathloner has to
train hard for all of these, every
ten events.”

“In the decathlon, you aren’t
really in competition with other
nations or individuals, but
rather with yourself, always
trying to reach a new high for
yourself in each event. You are
also competing against the
pressure of the Olympics and
the records of the past
American greats, Bob Mat-
thius, Rafer Johnson, Bill
Toomey.”’

Winning the decathlon has
changed the lives of Jenner and
his wife. Their lives have
become more public, so much
that he has learned to ap-
preciate his private life. When

T-ballers

he first started training in San
Jose, Calif., no one knew him.
Now, from the front of
‘“‘Wheaties” to ABC television
commentator, he receives
extensive coverage.

During the clinic, he talked
about how he had trained for the
Olympics. He spent the first
half of his time on endurance.
He ran alot and worked on the
quantity of his exercises. Not
only did he run but he
weightlifted and he credits his
success to this.

“You gotta lift. If you take
two guys of comparable ability
in any event or sport, the
stronger guy always wins out.
During my training I con-
centrated on squats, clean and
jerks, and incline bench with
dumbbells.”’

The second half of his training
consisted of quality not quantity
in his exercise routine. He
concentrated on the specifics
and techniques of each event.

He maintains that he didn’t
have a particular diet, but just
ate regular meals. He did ingest
63 pills a day, though, ranging
from potassium, iron, and
vitamin complexes, to One-a-
Day. He doesn’t know whether
or not it helped him, but at the
time, he psychologically felt
it did. He does know that it gave
him ‘‘the most expensive urine
in the world.”’

During his workouts with the
team in which he demonstrated
the techniques he used in the
different events, he repeatedly
pointed out that the training
aspect of any sport was 80 per
cent physical and 20 per cent
mental. He stressed that, ‘You
must believe in yourself and in
what you are doing if you are
going to succeed in life.’’ This
set the mood for the evening’s
Contact talk.

bounce back

by Jim Barnes

After a disappointing road
trip over the spring break the
W&L netters bounced back to
take three out of five matches
during the first week of the
spring semester. Prior to the
trip, the Washington and Lee
tennis team was ranked 11th in
the nation among Divison III
schools. The Generals traveled
to Florida, Georgia, and North
Carolina to face strong op-
ponents, who, not unexpectedly,
handed W&L five losses. W&L
suffered substantial defeats
from the University of Florida,
8-1, Rollins, 9-0, Georgia Tech,

6-3, and Davidson, 6-3. The
Generals were trimmed by the
University of Tampa, 5-4. The
W&L netters avoided a shutout
by beating Eckerd College, 7-2.

Some encouraging factors
were seen on the trip south.
Freshman Stewart Jackson had
a fine record of 4-2 for the trip at
his number 2 singles spot which
included an impressive win
over the University of Florida’s
John Kunman, who posted a 32-4
record last year. Jackson also
triumphed over Georgia Tech’s,
Davidson’s, and Eckerd’s
number 2 singles man. At the

No. 7 Generals vs No. 6 UVa.

by Bill Flesher

Charlie Brown swears he’ll
keep his promise.

“‘Last year,”’ the 1976 second-
team All-American goalie
started, ‘I played better in the
first half of the year than I did
later in the season.”

“This year I promised myself
that I’d save the best for last.’’

And, as Washington and Lee’s
lacrosse team faced two critical
games on the road last week,
Brown effectively embarked on
keeping his word.

The junior netminder turned
away 25 shots Wednesday as the
Generals stifled an explosive
North Carolina team 13-7, then
came back with a 16-save
performance Saturday as W&L
bested Towson State by an
identical count.

In improving their record to 7-
2, as well as jumping from tenth
to seventh in this week’s
USILA lacrosse poll, the
Generals dominated two teams
which had given them fits in
recent years. The win at Chapel
Hill was W&L’s first over UNC
since 1974, while not since 1972
had the Generals handled the
Tigers with such relative ease.

“Tt was a great week for us,
especially with what we have
coming up,” said W&L coach
Jack Emmer. “We had twe
very good games from the point
of team defense, while on of-
fense we just kept running and
eventually outran both our
opponents.”’

For all practical purposes,
W&L had won both games long
before the final whistle. After
trading goals to a 2-2 standoff,
the Generals scored eight goals
over a 33-minute stretch in
which every Tar Heel scoring

  

 

Brown. on the move.

effort was thwarted by the
stingy W&L defense.

While four of the goals came
in extra-man situations, Em-
mer credited good ball
movement by the Generals as
the key to breaking the game
open.

“Tt wasn’t the standard sort of
fast break where the outlet pass
from the goalie might give you
four on three, but it was our
offensive players continually
moving that gave us good
scoring opportunities,’’ said
Emmer, who was surprised by
what he termed ‘‘a lack of of-
fense by Carolina” throughou
the third quarter.

Jay Sindler led W&L scorers
with three goals and an assist,
while Stieff, Mark Derbyshire,
and Johnny Black joined
Kearney with two each.

Yevoli led all players with
four goals.

The Generals demonstrated a

Track Men
Hobble to 3-1

Last year’s outdoor track club
had a reputation of losing the
close meets. But after
squeaking out their third
straight victory over the Spring
Break, nobody could say that
about this year’s team.
However, a continuous rash of
crippling injuries is making it
difficult to sustain that record.

The Generals captured an
exciting victory in the first
home meet of the year defeating
Eastern Mennonite 76-69. That
win was secured when W&L
won the last event of the day,
the mile relay. W&L then
traveled to Wake Forest where
they lost to the host team but
overcame Emory and Henry
College by three points.

At Wake Forest the Generals
suffered the loss of co-captain
John Tucker with a recurrent
hamstring injury and _high-
jumper Tony Perry with a back
injury. And co-captain Paul
Thomson continued to be
hampered by Strained
ligaments in his knee.

Even though the injuries
make the future cloudy, the
team still relished a 3-1 record.
Strong performances in the
sprints by Larry Banks, Jack

Norberg and John Tucker have
carried a large load all season.
Meanwhile, Phil Dunlay and
Hank Phillips are giving the
Generals a steady scoring due
to the weight events.

The Generals now face the
bulk of their schedule including
several conference foes. If they
can overcome the injuries and
perform better, the end of the
season could find them at the
head of the league.

similar dominance three days
later under the lights at Towson
State. After the Tigers had
jumped to an early 2-0 lead, the
Generals scored nine of the next
10 goals, including six in a row
in the second period.

A four-goal spurt in the third
quarter put W&L ahead, 13-4,
also creating an atmosphere
along the Generals’ bench
which Emmer noted “led to
some breakdowns in the final
period that we’d best get out of
our system soon.’’

Again it was the W&L running
game that enabled the offense
to explode in spurts. Jeff Fritz
scored twice with 12 seconds in
the second-quarter blitz, while
Black followed with one of his
game-high four goals just
19 seconds later.

Meanwhile Brown was adding
a dangerous but exciting
dimension to the W&L offense,
straying far from the cage on
several clearing occasions, one
time going all the way only to
have a shot on goal knocked
away by Tiger goalie Paul
Russo.

“Once in a while Charlie’s got
to cool it out of the cage — it cost
us a couple of times last week,”’
said Emmer.

“But C. B. had an excellent
week in goal (Brown was
named the outstanding player
in the UNC game), and there’s
no way we'll be telling him to
hold back down the stretch.”

W&L fans surely hope that
will be the case. For Charlie
Brown has a promise he wishes
to keep.

Soccer in the spring

by Kenneth Smith

With everything else going on
at W&L, it hardly seems
possible that in the spring a
young man’s fancy would turn
to soccer. Surely more
traditional spring sports such as
baseball or lacrosse would have
greater appeal for the W&L
sportsman than soccer. But
after talking to soccer coach
Rolf Piranian, I found that I
could not have been more
wrong. Piranian was up on the
practice fields when I finally
tracked him down pitching in a
combination — softball-lacrosse
game. But when the whistle
blew to end practice, lacrosse
was the farthest thing from his
mind, for soccer spring practice
is just around the corner. “On
May second we'll start prac-
ticing. Anyone interested in
playing next fall must attend so
that we can get some idea of
what the team will be like.”

Moreover it is not as though
these practices will be attended
by just a few hearty souls.
Coach Piranian fully expects
that there may be as many as
seventy people out for the team
this year despite the fact that
last year’s team finished with a
three and ten mark. When I
asked him about the record he
pointed to the competition that
the team faced. “We are a
division three school that plays
a schedule loaded with division
one teams. In this way we gain
excellent experience.” In other
words, the record does not
reflect the progress made
during the season, a tired cliche
which everyone has heard at
least one hundred times before.
Coach Piranian is determined
to turn the program around and
to force other schools to use the
cliches.

It has not been that way for a
long time. Thinking back, he
told me that since W&L soccer
started in 1946, the program has
been a series of ups and downs.
In 1964 as a matter of fact W&L
went to the Division ITI playoffs.
After the season, coach
Piranian remembers that his
senior year the soccer team,
which he was a part of, finished
7-2. But since then, W&L soccer
has suffered through a long
drought.

Sports

Basketball coach Verne
Canfield, already ODAC coach
of the year, was named Division
III district III Coach-of-the
year. Pat Dennis was named
the outstanding College
Division Player in Virginia.

After the 1976-77 fall and
winter sports seasons, the
Generals hold a slim edge over
the Lynchburg Hornets in the
race for overall supremacy in
the ODAC.

Former pro and W&L football
great, Walt Michaels ’51, has
been inducted into the Virginia
Sports Hall of Fame. Michaels
is presently head coach of the
New York Jets.

But he passed over these
years to talk about the plans he
has made for next year’s team.
‘‘What we’re striving for and
what I think we’re ac-
complishing is a certain con-
sistency. We want to be con-
sistently good.”’ Well this goal is
all well and good, but how does
he plan to achieve it aside from
scheduling Division I schools.
Obviously practice is the an-
swer. He wanted to emphasize
that, “soccer is a year round
sport. What I think a lot of
people don’t realize is that after
our regular season in the fall we
also have an indoor season in
the winter. We play up in the old
gym and even some of the
football players join us.
Recently we just came back
from a big tournament in
Roanoke. Now we have spring
practice coming up.”

Turning away from the
practice schedule, I asked him
about what support soccer gets
from the campus_- and
surrounding community. “Well,
not too much really,’ he
replied. ‘‘Most of the people in
the stands are football players
who are getting ready to start
practice. Though we do ap-
preciate their watching us, it
does bother the players that
there are not many people in the
stands. I don’t worry about it
that much. I’m just trying to
improve the program and
maybe with more success more
people will come out to see us.”

Dr. Frederic Schwab, a
Washington and Lee geology
professor, placed about 940th to
950th out of a field of 3,000
runners in the classic Boston
Marathon Monday. Schwab,
who called the race “‘the most
exciting thing I’ve ever done,”’
said today that it took him four
minutes to reach the starting
line because of the ‘flood of
people’ in the race. The veteran
runner made the race in three
hours, three minutes, moving in
80 degree weather — “‘It was a
little warm’? — and at times
through a narrow corridor of
people 10 feet deep. As he and
other runners reached the finish
line, Schwab said, ‘‘there were
100,000 people screaming like
mad.”

THE RING-TUM PHI 5

Running for MS

(Continued from page 1)

the W&L and Lexington com-
munity.

A number of students, in-
cluding the _ irrespressible
Gallagher, have already begun
training for the 15-mile run.
Jerry Darrell, the local
chairman for the MS drive, has
indicated he will serve liquid
refreshments to the runners at
various checkpoints. Lexington
City Manager John Doane and
the Highway Department have
agreed to help with the control
of traffic and crowds along the
race route. Several of the area
merchants, including Pres
Brown’s, The Lexington
Bookstore, Schewell’s Fur-
niture, Hess’s Jewelry and
Dixon’s Exxon, have agreed to
sponsor the race. And both the
Young Republicans and Young
Democrats have offered their
services. In fact, the two clubs
have hinted at challenging each
other to run during the race.

Gallagher noted that the race
started as an idea to involve the
many members of the W&L
community who like to run in an
annual event — a mini-version
of the Boston Marathon. The
idea evolved into a larger scale
charity race when Pat Falls, a
MS spokesman for the area,
approached Gallagher about
donating the proceeds to MS.

By involving MS in the event,
Gallagher noted that ‘‘not only
will we be helping MS but it
gives the race a meaning, a
cause.’’ He pointed out that the
MS fund drive only collected
$1,000 in the Lexington area last
year. It is hoped that the added
incentive helping out a worthy
cause such as MS will attract
more runners, including some
from Roanoke and Lynchburg,
which will in turn mean more
money for the fund.

The race will begin at 10 a.m.
in front of the County Court-
house on Main Street. From
there the contestants will run on
Rt. 11 to Rt. 631. The route will
follow 631 to Rt. 624 and then to
Rt. 625. From 625 the runners
will rejoin 631 which they will
travel till reaching Rt. 60. They
will run on 60 to the Liberty Hall
access road, past the Woods
Creek apartments, back to Rt.
60 to the stadium access road,
and finally end up by running
one lap around the track at
Wilson Field. The top three
runners will get a trophy
donated by Press Brown’s and
each entrant will receive a T-
shirt with the name of the race
printed on it. The T-shirt gives
the runners ‘“‘something to
remember the race by and is
also a form of publicity for the
future’’ according to Gallagher.

Wahoos in Wonderland

Once upon a time there was a
sleepy little school in a sleepy
little town in a beautiful and
green valley with mountains all
around. The students at the
school were like those anywhere
else — some slept all the time,
some played, others walked
around with their noses buried
in big thick books. During the
Spring there seemed to be fewer
and fewer with their noses in
books; most bought inner tubes
and spent their Saturday af-
ternoons floating in big pools of
beer and Southern Comfort.

Alas, it seemed for a long
time that none of these boys
could become interested in
anything but reading or floating
all day long. Until one day one
got the bright idea of tying a net
on the end of a pole and tossing
a ball with it. Soon everyone in
the sleepy little town was
running up and down the
football field waving their
sticks, hitting each other with
them, and having a glorious
time.

Then, word of the Wahoos
came to town. No one knew
what a Wahoo was or where the
Wahoos came from. They
carried sticks just the same,
tossed the ball quickly from one
to the other — and the people in
the little town were sore afriad.

Then the people said, ‘‘Why
don’t we leave the books and our
inner tubes and join together to
beat the Wahoos back?’’ And it
was done. The books were.
tossed aside, and the lovely
pools were drunk dry — and
everyone gathered together and
traveled to the Green to end the
Wahoos threat once and for all.
The battle began.

The Wahoos looked mean and
fierce. Most people thought the
Wahoos were meaner and
fiercer than the people of the
sleepy little school. But as the
battle began, a CB* gritted his
teeth and said, ‘‘The Wahoos
aren’t that tough.’’ And sending
their Keigs and Duds and all the
rest on the field, the people of
the beautiful and green valley
beat the Wahoos and showed
them who was meaner and
tougher.

It is said that the people of the
sleepy little school will never be
the same again. They are no
longer afraid of anyone. They
have their CB, their Keigs, their
Duds, and all the rest. And they
have a reason to drink up those
beautiful little pools of beer and
Southern Comfort. The End.

Even though the event is
being run on a relatively small
scale this year, Gallagher in-
dicated things will be better in
the future. ‘‘My hopes for the
race are that it will grow each
year.” Towards that goal, the
EC donated $150 to the race on
Monday night even though only
$100 was requested.

Golfers win
ODAC

by Warren Mowry

Despite galleries whose size
would have made even the
smallest crowds at a W&L
basketball game seem massive
by comparison, the Washington
and Lee golf team continued the
school’s winning ways in the
ODAC by showing their heels to
the.rest of the seven-team field
and capturing the ODAC con-
ference championship.

W&L was never threatened
and pulled away to an eventual
twenty stroke edge in the two
day tourney at Lexington C. C.
The Generals’ composite score
of 601 was followed by Lyn-
chburg College with 621, with
Hampden Sydney placing third.
R-MC followed, with
Bridgewater, Roanoke College,
and Emory & Henry trailing the
field.

W&L also dominated the post-
season honors, with sophomore
Dave Leunig, from Louisville,

6 THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Welcome to the new Ring-+tum Phi.

The Ring-+tum Phi, while glad of the opportunity to
move into the twentieth century in terms of printing
technology, does so with some feelings of regret. In
making this leap, we leave behind the friendly and
familiar environs of the University Print Shop, where
the Ringtum Phi has flourished — well, lived,
anyway — for many years. We have always con-
sidered the members of the Print Shop staff to be our
personal friends. They will be missed, even if we are
not.

Readjusting to a whole new system is difficult and
will take some time, hence the decision to go ahead
with it now, for the remainder of the Spring term,
rather than wait and attempt the conversion in the
Fall. The move would probably never have been
made at all had it not been forced upon us by “‘higher
powers’? — the University administration, who, in
their relentless search for economy and efficiency,
are planning to eliminate most of the high-quality
print facilities at W&L. My personal feeling toward
this sort of C-school mentality is one of disgust.

On the positive side, the offset capabilities of The

_News-Gazette, our new printers, will allow the
Ringtum Phi more room for more stories, much
greater freedom in terms of layout and graphics, and
will give our staff valuable experience in modern
print techniques. We look forward to a friendly and
fruitful working relationship with the staff of the
News-Gazette, and hope that our newly-expanded
capacities will continue to serve the best interests of
the University community.

The page one gloss of the results of the Publications
Board elections does not tell the whole story of what
went on during those most weighty deliberations. I
am in a strange position here — voting member of the
Board, reporter on the Board’s actions, and editorial
commentator on those actions — caught between
libertarian dedication to freedom of the press and
concern for the possible effects of total revelation on
the upcoming election for Ring-tum Phi editor. The
division on the Board fell along political, ideological
and personal lines. One of the candidates for editor at
the time of the first meeting, around whom much of
the controversy was centered, is under consideration
again, and I do not wish to influence his candidacy. On
the other hand, the University community has as
much right to know what the Publications Board does
as it has to know what any other official body does.
Not that too many people care. Next week: the whole
story.

I am not “eating crow” over the fact that Joe
Fitzgerald has withdrawn from the University and
will not be able to serve as editor of next year’s Ring-
tum Phi. Rather, I view his departure with greater
regret than I have felt over anything else that has
happened during this long and difficult year. The
Ring-tum Phi will suffer most immediately; in my
view, the University as a whole has been diminished.

Lee lacrosse is in danger. The
future in this case concerns not
only a matter of weeks and
months but also years. The
danger is to the quality of W&L
lacrosse, and the cause of the
threat is the cross and ob-
noxious behavior of many W&L
fans. In this current season, we
fans are enjoying the best
lacrosse contests, against the
nation’s toughest teams, that
have ever been seen in
Lexington. Indeed, I believe
that most fans realize this, and
do truely appreciate how for-
tunate we are to have such high
quality Division I competition
at such a small school as ours.
To think of our Spring term
without this to enjoy is a virtual
nightmare. But this is what is
going to occur in the future, and
we may give thanks to our
unintelligent fans who hurl a
barrage of beer cans and ob-
scentities upon our opponents.
This behavior is _ being
generalized as the typical
behavior of the entire W&L
crowd by almost all of the other
schools we play. As a result,
many of these schools are
showing a reluctance to re-
schedule us. The University of
Maryland and Navy gave
strong implications that this
was the reason they refused to
reschedule us. With this con-
tinued behavior, the trend could
easily continue to point where
our “Ultimate in Springtime
Entertainment” will be con-
stituted of grade B lacrosse.
This would truly be a fine ac-
complishment by us, the W&L
““Gentlemen.”’

and we all realize the im-
portance of the psychological
edge in lacrosse. A less talented
team with a good attitude and a
spirited, supportive crowd
behind them can many times
defeat a more talented team.
The crowd support here is the
key. A crowd that hurls ob-
scenities does not support, it
destroys. It destroys their own
integrity and respect, but also
the team with which they are
associated. We need completely
POSITIVE support. Scream,
yell and cheer, be heard, but
make sure it’s positive. It is far
more effective in bolstering our
team and demoralizing theirs
(Think - honestly - What would
you rather hear if you were on
the field working your butt
off?). By doing this, we can

alter the course on which we are
headed in future years, and
make our team the NCAA
champions in the coming
weeks.

We can start on Friday. At 7
p.m. in the freshman quad there
is a pep rally for the lacrosse
team to get them rolling into
Wahoo game (and the Wahoos’
will be psyched). There’ll be
plenty of beer to keep the vocal
chords in tune, and a banner
contest (The winner gets a few
cases of beer). On Saturday, be
ready to scream and cheer the
whole game — never let them
down. If you see someone being
obnoxious, kindly ask him to
alter his style. The Cham-
pionship starts on Saturday —
Let’s do it!!!

Sincerely
Woody Wooddell ’77

e Dear Sir:
Letter s to the Editor I’ve seen three W&L lacrosse
games on Wilson Field this
. fi t .
Dear Sir: : But this potential end can be sadedtien in 1975, The Saha
The future of Washington and —_ avoided. We all love the team, about support for W&L lacrosse

still aren’t empty ones; the fans
are still rather vociferous, But
how can I convince the majority
of them that what they scream
during each game is boorish
and ignorant drivel?

I considered an appeal to
their pride in their knowledge of
the game. But after hearing the
bombardment of obscenities
that awaits any referee who
calls a non-flagrant foul on
W&L, I realized that most fans
don’t care how ignorant they
sound.

Next, I wondered if an
argument for sportsmanship
might help. I dropped that idea
like a double-knit sportcoat
after hearing a W&L staffer yell
taunts at the N. C. State bench
(while the Generals were being
eaten alive by one of the best
attackmen I’ve ever seen).

What else can I use as an
argument? Not much. I don’t
think anything will penetrate
the smug conviction in
Lexington that the fans are
what makes W&L lacrosse
successful. But the truth is that
while enthusiastic support
accompanies a winning team
(and complements it), crude
attempts at humor, ignorant
rantings, and drunken
screaming can harm the team’s
image much more than lack of
attendance can hurt it.
Washington and Lee fans come
off looking like jackasses, and
they can be thankful of several
things: 1) that Lexington is
remote enough that W&L must
schedule lots of backwater
teams who’ll take their punish-
ment and leave, 2) that players
on the field rarely hear in-
dividual voices from the stands
(the most idiotic chatter sounds
remarkable like cheering), and
3) that none of the fans listen to
what the others are yelling, so
nobody knows just how bad they
sound.

I’ll be interested to hear the
depths of bad taste and
childishness that are plumbed
at the Maryland game. See you
there.

number 1 position Ben Johns
registered a 3-3 record on the
road with wins over Georgia
Tech’s, University of Tampa’s,
and Eckerd’s top player.
Captain Ken Voelker also
posted a 3-3 record defeating the
University of Tampa’s,
Davidson’s, and Eckerd’s
number 3 singles player. The
three freshmen, number 4 Dee
Kesler, number 5 Richard
Makepeace, and number 6
David Constine posted a
disappointing 2-16 record
overall for the road trip at their
respective singles positions.
Coach Bussard expressed
some concern that the bottom
three freshmen have a “low
level of confidence,’’ because of
their several losses to ad-
mittedly far stronger op-
ponents. If Washington and Lee
is to have a .500 season or better
these freshmen will have to
improve on this won-loss record
against stronger opponents.
Coach Bussard hopes that the
match experience against the
tough opponents of the spring
break tour will show up toward
the end of the season when W&L
will again tackle, strong foes,
the likes of the Naval Academy
and the University of Virginia.
During the first week of the
spring semester the W&L
netters won three out of five
matches, On Monday William
and Mary toppled the Generals
for a 7-2 loss. One bright spot
was Ben John’s thrilling 7-6, 4-6,
6-4 victory over Marc Adams.
On Thursday and Friday the
W&L netters split two closely
contested matches with the
University of Richmond and Old
Dominion University. The
Generals edged Richmond 5-4,
but fell short by one match,
losing to O.D.U. by 4-5.
Finishing the week the W&L
netters traveled to Washington,
D. C. for two matches on
Saturday against George Mason
University in the morning and
Georgetown University in the
afternoon. Out of eighteen
matches played the Generals
captured sixteen defeating both
schools by an 8-1 margin.

The Ring-tum Phi editorship
was the only election at the
March 21 meeting to stir any
controversy among members of
the Board. Bill Thomson,
president of the Board, read a
prepared statement prior to
that election accusing ‘“‘certain
members” of the Board of
engaging in questionable
political maneuvering prior to
the meeting. Steve Yevich
responded to the statement by
denying any such wrongdoing
on his part. Mr. Yevich, last
year’s Ring-tum Phi editor, has
since resigned from the Board.

rebounded to win four in a row,
all in convincing fashion, in-
cluding the most recent, a 13-10
win over arch-rival Virginia
last Saturday. In seventeen
meetings between the Terps
and Generals, W&L_ has
managed to win but once, that
being a 9-8 come from behind
win in 1950. Since then, the
closest a W&L team has come to
beating Maryland was last
season when the stickmen
dropped a 16-14 decision.

Not only will W&L be fighting
to end a 14 game dominance,
but the All-American goalie who

engineered that lone 9-8
triumph in 1950, Bill Clements
and his wife Jane will be in
attendance on Saturday. For
good reason, of course — their
son Bob is a 5-11 freshman
goalie and the teams’ leading
faceoff specialist. Bob’s day has
fond memories of _ that
memorable day back in ’50.
W&L’s first first-team All-
American lacrosse player
recalls that game. ‘‘Maryland
coach Jack Faber was fairly
confident that his team would
beat us as evidenced by the fact
that he was correcting his
biology papers during the first
half. He had little reason to
worry as the Terps led 5-4, and
all was according to schedule
after two quarters. We came on
to tie the score at eight with one
quarter to go. With three
minutes left to play, senior Tom
Tongue put us on top 9-8.
Maryland won the ensuing
faceoff, but a check got us the
ball and we froze it for the last
two and a half minutes.”’
Quoting a W&L athletic
release from that season, ‘Bill
Clements was credited with
over 20 saves against Maryland,

Executive Committee would
have to find an alternative
exam schedule.

To the distress of many
students, the third possibility
cannot be ruled out. According
to Dr. Cook, his proposal is not
without justification. He em-
phasizes that he has nothing
personal against independent
exams. Yet at the same time he
also points out that, “the in-
dependent exam _ schedule
places a tremendous strain on
the Honor System in that it
provides the student greater
opportunities to cheat. Fur-
thermore it may lead to a subtle
erosion of the overall Honor
System. For example if a
student is willing to cheat on his
final exams he may be en-
couraged to cheat on his earlier
tests and quizes. And if it comes
to that...if it comes down to a
choice between independent
exams and the Honor System, I
will choose the Honor System.

Law school

Chains loosened in ’69

by Randy Smith

Nineteen sixty-nine was a
turbulent year on college
campuses across the nation.
Rules were revised as ad-
ministrators bent to student
pressure. Washington and Lee,
although a little late to join the
student activism trend, also
experienced important
changes.

In October, W&L students
participated in a nationwide
moratorium against the Viet-
nam War. The faculty Student
Affairs Committee allowed a
major concession in fraternity
regulations : ‘‘Female guests
may be allowed on the upper
floors of the fraternity houses
between the hours of 5 p.m. on
Friday and 12 midnight Sunday,
with the understanding that
overnight visitations are
prohibited.’”’ And the issue of

formally dedicated on Satur-
day, May 7, at 11:30 a.m.
Construction began on the site
in 1973, and the building went
into use in the fall of 1976. It
replaced Tucker Hall as the

home of the law school.
Dedication activities will
begin on Friday, May 6, with

Goldwater here May 12

by Bill Kerr

Sen. Barry M. Goldwater, will
address the W&L community in
Lee Chapel on May 12 at 8 p.m.
This speech will be co-
sponsored by the W&L Young
Republicans and Contact.

Goldwater, R-Ariz., is making
his second appearance at W&L,
the first being in 1969.

In 1964, W&L_ students
predicted Goldwater as their
choice for president during that
year’s Mock Republican
Convention.

Goldwater has been a leading
force in the Republican Party
for nearly 30 years. Goldwater
has been a member of the U. S.
Senate since 1953 and is credited
with making the Arizona GOP

the state’s dominant political
force for over 20 years. This was
best illustrated by his 1952
Senate victory which then
ousted Senate Majority leader
Ernest MacFarland.

In the Senate, Goldwater
serves as the ranking member
of the Aeronautical and Space
Science Committee. He also is
serving on the Armed Services
Committee and the select
Committee on Intelligence
Operations. However, he is
better known for his consistent
conservative - liberatarian
philosophy. He received a 100
rating from the American
Conservation Union and raised
eyebrows when he fought
against both the draft and the

independant exams came
before the students and faculty.

On December 10th, in a
referendum vote, the student
body overwhelmingly approved
the concept of an independant
examination schedule. Almost
800 students voted in favor of
the proposal, with only 35
dissenting votes.

The faculty discussed the
issue, weighing the pros and
cons of various recom-
mendations for a viable plan.
The primary objection to an’
independant exam schedule
was that it might prove taxing
on the Honor’ System.
Nonetheless, a system for in-
dependant exams, taken on a
day of the student’s choosing,
was adopted, to take effect
during the next academic year.

Now, seven years after the
implementation of independant
examinations, the system is
under what appears to be its
toughest challenge yet, because
as the faculty gives, the faculty
can also take away. At last
Monday’s faculty meeting, a
motion was presented to repeal
the independant exam schedule,
the first such motion since its
inception.

One administration source
said that the motion was an
expression of doubts that had
been building in the minds of
some of the faculty for ‘‘quite

New Phi

editor chosen

by Bob Lutz

J. Michael Gallagher has
been elected editor-in-chief of
the Ring-tum Phi for the 1977-78
academic year.

Gallagher’s election came
Monday, April 25 at a special
meeting of the University
Publications Board.

Previously, the Board had
elected Joe Fitzgerald to the
post but was obligated to reopen
applications for the position
after Fitzgerald decided to
withdraw from the University.

Gallagher, a rising junior,
brings limited experience to the
job, having served as Sports
Editor only since midway
through the Fall term, and with
no other journalistic ex-
perience. He is known primarily
as a sports activist and en-
thusiast.

His election is a clear case of
fraud, blackmail and bribery.
2 THE RING-TUM PHI

E.C. tries to laugh problems away

by Lee Howard

“The E. C. in the spring,”
commented Sandy Stradtman
while shaking his head.

Anyone who had never at-
tended an Executive Committee
meeting before would not have
believed that the persons joking
and clowning around at the long
horseshoe desk were members
of the most important student
government organization on
campus.

The only issue at Monday’s
meeting that was discussed
Straight-faced was what the
faculty is going to do about
independent exams. Stradtman,
E. C. vice president, said that
he had recommended at the
weekly faculty meeting earlier
in the day that independent
exams be kept for ‘‘at least one
more year.”’

Stradtman said some of the
faculty’s feelings against in-
dependent exams “‘aren’t un-
founded.’’ Although he _per-
sonally favors independent
exams Stradtman said there is
“a lot of talking going on”
during finals week. He also said
he believes there is a reluctance
to turn someone in for an honor
violation.

Stradtman said that if the
faculty give students another
year before deciding on the
independent exam issue the E.
C. should do all it can to inform
students on the honor system
through the Ring-tum Phi,
posters, freshman orientation

at Natural Bridge and dorm
councilors.

The independent exam issue
will be resolved, at least for
now, at this week’s faculty
meeting, said Stradtman. The
faculty requested that Jim
Underhill, next year’s E. C.
president, and Tom Hunter, the
present E. C. president, be at
that meeting, according to
Stradtman.

The next issue brought up was
the year-end Executive Com-
mittee party. The E. C. had to
decide when it should be held
and how much money should be
appropriated for it.

‘“‘Just appropriate $300-$400
and return what we don’t need,”
suggested a smiling Walt
Kelley, senior E. C.
representative.

“Is this stag?’’ asked George
Griffin, next year’s E. C. vice
president.

‘‘What are we going to eat?”
asked someone else.

‘Lobster neuberg, sirloin...”
said Kelley.

‘“‘Are we going to have favors
at this party,’ asked senior
Paul Larkin, E. C. represen-
tative.

‘‘We have favors that will do
you favors,”’ said Griffin in his
best Groucho Marx imitation.

Finally, someone proposed
that the E. C. appropriate $250
for the party and that it be held
Tuesday.

‘All in favor say ‘aye.’ All
opposed, ‘nay.’ The ayes have

Former ass’t attorney

general to speak

Herbert Wechsler, a leading
Constitutional law scholar and
former assistant United States
attorney general, will deliver
the annual John Randolph
Tucker lecture in law at
Washington and Lee University
May 7.

Wechsler’s topic will be “‘The
Appellate Jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court: Reflections on
the Law and the Logistics of
Direct Reviews.”’ The address
will take place at 10:30 a.m. in
the Moot Court Room of Lewis
Hall.

The Tucker lecturer is
currently Harlan Fiske Stone
professor of law at Columbia
University. His professorship is
named for the late Supreme
Court justice for whom he was
law secretary in 1932-33.

Wechsler was __ special
assistant to the Attorney
General from 1940 to 1944, and
was assistant Attorney General
in charge of the Justice
Department’s war division
from 1944 to 1946. During that
latter period he was also
technical advisor to the
American members of the
International Military Tribune.

His major books include ‘‘The
Nationalization of Civil
Liberties and Civil Rights’ and
“Principles, Politics and
Fundamental Law.’’ He is also
co-author of ‘‘The Federal
Courts and the
System” and “Criminal Law
and its Administration.”

His topic, the Supreme
Court’s direct review
procedures, will be of special
interest to at least one member
of his audience — Supreme
Court Justice Lewis F. Powell
Jr., a W&L graduate and
himself a former Tucker lec-
turer (1966). Powell will be on
campus that weekend for the
law school dedication
ceremonies and for the regular
spring meeting of the W&L
board of trustees, of which he is
a member.

Child Abuse-

topic of lecture

Dr. Willard Gaylin will lec-
ture at Washington and Lee
University Friday on the
subject “Who Speaks for the
Helpless Child?”’

Gaylin, co-founder and
president of the Institute of
Society, Ethics and the Life
Sciences, will speak in room 305
of Parmly Hall at 8 p.m. April
29. The public is invited to at-
tend.

The Institute, located in
Hastings-on-Hudson, N. Y., was
founded in 1969 and is one of two
major centers in the country for
the study of contemporary
social problems.

it,” said Larkin. Indeed, no
formal vote was taken on the
matter, although Neil Pentifallo
said after the meeting, ‘I’m on
the record as paying my own
way. I’m adamantly opposed”’
to the E. C. appropriating
money for its own party.

The only other action the E. C.
took during the half-hour
meeting was to announce the
University Council candidates
and to impose a $7.50 spending
limit and a poster limit of 25.
The election will be held
Monday.

The candidates for U. C. will
be: sophomores — Car] Carbzzi,
Marc Birenbaum, Buff Martin,
Deekeesler; seniors — Peter C.
Reefe, Will Clemens, John F.
Sacco, Ryland Owen.

When someone asked what
would happen in the case of a
tie, Radar Davis, E. C.
secretary, said ‘‘We’ll flip a
coin’”’ to find out who wins. It
was that kind of a meeting.

SAB

appointments

announced

Doug Jackson and Charlie
Hulfish have been appointed co-
chairmen of the Student Ac-
tivities Board for the 1977-78
school-year. Tom McCarthy
was named secretary of the

ROTC to invade
Fredericksburg

by Reid Slaughter

Little did you know that even
as you read this, extensive
plans are being made for a
large scale Army manuever in
our area.

It is called FTX (meaning
Field Training Exercise) and is
taking place outside
Fredericksburg, Virginia this
weekend as part of the W&L
ROTC program. Approximately
fifty ROTC students will take
part in the exercise, designed
initially to promote leadership
training and the ability to work

_ Closely with others.

This particular event differs
from previous FTX’s in that it
involves both National Guards-
men and Army Green Beret.
The plan is for the W&L ROTC
to act as the enemy
(presumably Communist, for
some reason) and try to wipe
out a group of sixty ‘‘trapped ”’
National Guardsmen while the
Special Forces Green Beret
attempts to rescue the soldiers.
The manuever lasts about 2%
days, ending Sunday afternoon.

Maj. Wolf D. Kutter and Sgm.
Otis Wright have worked out
detailed plans, but they will be

“ carried out by two student

ROTC leaders Mike Cleary and
Dorman Walker. The plans
include the use of helicopters,
reconnaissance aircraft, and a
large portion of jeeps and
trucks. ‘“‘We were invited to
take part in these manuevers
primarily because we are a
more enthusiastic enemy than
other Reserve units’’ stated
Maj. Kutter, who went on to
point out that the exercises
were of invaluable experience
for those ROTC students who
are preparing to go through a
five week advance training
camp at Ft. Bragg between
their junior and senior years.

There have been two previous
FTX’s this year, the first

  

*Lacrosse Ties

* Madras Belts

coming during the first
weekend in October. This was
primarily for freshmen, and
included an introduction into
basic field manuevers, As one
frosh ROTC student remarked,
“Tt really made you appreciate
what goes into the training and
how hard it is to operate when
there is shooting going on all
around you. Even though the
bullets weren’t real, it was kind
of scary.”

The second FTX was called
“GATOR SWAMP ONE”, and
took place around the Maury
River behind the new law
school. Although primarily for
juniors, all class levels were
allowed to take part. The two-
day exercise included
patrolling, raiding and more
individual activity, while the
second day was devoted to a
small scale war between two
“‘armies’’, with both sides going
on the attack and falling back
on defense.

In general, the purpose of
FTX is to allow the students to
use some of their knowledge
acquired in the classroom
(which is where the bulk of the
learning in the ROTC program
takes place) to use in the field.
‘“‘What it comes down to,” says
Kutter, “‘is the ability to think
on your feet and the ability to
direct others.’

Art under the sky

Student arts fair and ‘‘one o'clock theatre’’

by Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

The months of April and May
will see an unprecedented
flurry of activity on the lawns of
W&L. The dogs will just have to
move over; cutlure, in the form
of outdoor art and theater
productions, has moved in.

In the forefront of this activity
is the first Washington and Lee
Student Arts Fair, scheduled for
Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday — May 18-20. A group of
students, aided by the fine arts
faculty, recently appeared
before the E. C. and received
$500 to budget the operation.

“The purpose of this fair,”
said Dan Scott, a main coor-
dinator of the project, ‘‘is to
focus everyone’s attention on
what’s happening in the arts —
to let everyone see it for
themselves.’’ And what better

way, than to stage all the
productions on the front lawn
and exterior grounds of Lee
Chapel. Under the auspices of
the Washington and Lee ad-
ministration, three days of
student shows and exhibits will
be presented. Featured among
them will be a three day exhibit
of student photography,
painting, sculpture and
graphics of the Colonnade. In
addition, student musical
groups (such as the Cosmic
Cowboys) will be performing on
other areas of the front campus.

The first day’s activities will
be centered around activities
for area children, who will be
brought on campus to paint a
huge canvas, model in clay and
be filmed on videotape and then
allowed to view themselves. All
of this will climax at 3 p.m. ina
performance of the Rockbridge

Children’s Theater’s Annual
Show, June Morgan’s Circus
Magic. The musical will be
performed in the new Lee
Chapel courtyard and is the
story of Arnold, the Enchanted
Lion (played by student Hunt
Brown), and the efforts of a
young boy and girl to break the
spell cast on him by an evil
magician (Tab Brown). Other
familiar Theatre faces par-
ticipating include John
Hollinger, Phyllis Davis, Brock
Johnson, and Hugh Robinson.
The cast of 30 is composed of
ages 6 through 23, and will be
performed for an audience from
local orphanages, schools, and
those in the Big Brother
program.

Drama-related events will
take up much of the second day,
full of one-man shows and mime
productions. The final day will

bring everything together in an
exhibition of what the children
have created, another mime
show, and plenty of music. All
are invited to attend, stroll
around, and enjoy — of course,
at no cost.

IMPORTANT! There is one
thing that the students of W&L
must do if the fair is to succeed.
And that is to con-
tribute your creations — there
is hereby announced a plea and
call for drawings, paintings,
graphics, cartoons, sculpture,
literary works, dramatic and
musical compositions. They will
be performed, published,
exhibited, etc. without
screening — now this has to be
one of the greatest chances for
exposure for any budding artist,
and a good way to assure the
success of a worthwhile project.

For nights, there are plans
underway for student readings
of their literary works and
performances of their original
music. But contributions are
needed now! Please turn them
in to the art studio, duPont 107,
or call the Fine Arts Secretary
for more details.

were close to incredible.’’
Clements called that afternoon,
“the greatest game in my life.”
That contest was the first time a
so-called ‘‘nobody” had beaten
a ‘‘somebody” in collegiate
lacrosse. Twnety-seven years
later, & W&L diehards are
hoping that history can repeat
itself.

W&L junior goalie Charlie
Brown has turned in three
outstanding games in a row,
and is playing the best lacrosse
in his three year career.
Because of this, Bob Clements
will probably see most of his
playing time in the faceoff area,
but as far as coach Jack Em-
mer is concerned, that’s just
fine. ‘‘We had a dismal start
against U. Va. in the faceoff
area, but Clements came on and
had a great afternoon. He won
15 of 22 on the day.’’ On the
year, the 1976 graduate of St.
Paul’s has won 58 per cent of his
faceoffs to lead W&L.

The win over U. Va. was
W&L’s fifth straight over the
Cavaliers, but Emmer notes,
‘Regardless of the streak, it
still feels good to do it again.
There is no way we'll ever take
this one for granted.’’ W&L’s all
sophomore attach rose to the
occasion against the Wahoos,
combining for nine goals and six
assists. Cannon Award winner
Chris Kearney led the team
with four scores, while Jeff
Fritz had a 3-3 afternoon. Brown
was credited with 21 saves, and
delighted the fans with his of-
fensive spurts. W&L led 12-4

2:44 into the fourth quarter.

“We have to play our game
against Maryland,’’ says
Emmer, ‘‘We’re an explosive
team, and a team that has our
best play in front of us.”
Maryland is coming off a 16-13
win over the Naval Academy.
This game is W&L’s final
contest against a team ranked
in the USILA’s top five. The
Generals are sixth this week,
the same spot they opened the
year in. As Emmer said, ‘Our
four final games are all big
ones, but things are looking up
for the tournament.”

Before that however, it’s the
Terps on Saturday, and if the
weather holds up, the crowd
could better the Virginia game
attendance of 6,000.

Netmen Run Away With Title

Bussard Named Coach-of-the- Y ear

by Jim Barnes

It’s dynasty time for the
Washington and Lee _ tennis
team in the ODAC. While some
skeptics may suggest that my
observation may be a bit
premature, I simply point to the
results of the ODAC cham-
pionship held at W&L last week.
The team comprised of four
freshmen, one junior, and one
senior, captured with
astonishing ease all six singles
championships and all three
doubles championships.

Ben Johns, player-of-the-year
in the ODAC, lost only ten
games in three matches as he
played to perfection in winning
the number one singles
championship. But at number
two, Stewart Jackson tried
harder and only dropped nine
games in a romp in his number
two singles bracket. Captain
Ken Voelker continued his
winning ways and without
loosing a set won the number
three singles championship
round. Number four singles
player Dee Keesler, who had
previously lost only five games
in two matches, was forced into

The Generals’s golf team is
looking forward to a possible
bid to the Division III National
Tournament at Kenyon College
in Gambier, Ohio on May 24
through the 27th. The in-
vitations will be given by mid-
May. Since the team won the
ODAC Championship and has a
5-1 record in dual matches the
chances of getting an invitation
look promising. Tomorrow the
Generals take on Emory and
Henry at home. This dual match
and the remaining five matches
willl be crucial in the General’s
quest for a shot at the Division
III National Title.

The major reason for thinking
about the Nationals is the torrid
second 18 holes that clinched
victory in ODAC Cham-
pionships held Monday, April
18th. The Generals were leading
co-favorites Hampden-Sydney

Track Team Loses

Swinging back into action last
week, the Generals found
themselves on the short end of a
77-76 score with OCAC rival
Lynchburg College. More
importantly, W&L will have a
chance to redeem themselves

this Saturday at Bridgewater in
the First Annual ODAC Track
and Field Championships. The
Generals finish could be crucial
in determining the final overall
supremacy champion in the

conference. Bridgewater,
Lynchburg and W&L should
fight it out for the title, with
EMC as the darkhorse.

The highlight of the Lyn-
chburg meet was senior Mike
Burns performance in the three
mile. Burns ran a school record
breaking 14:54.2 and he now has
both the two mile and three mile
records to his credit. He is a
1973 graduate of Martinsbille
High in Martinsville, Va.

(continued on page 5)

a three set match for the
championship. He lost the first
set 4-6 to Hampden-Sydney’s
Dave Summerlin _ before
zooming to victory 6-1, 6-3 in the
second and third sets. Hamp-
den-Sydney again tripped W&L
when John Mansfield took the
first four games from Richard
Makepeace in the first set of
their championship match. The
Stalled Makepeace then ripped
off six straight games for the
first set and won the second set
7-5. David Constine found little
trouble in winning the number
six championship round
disposing of the opposition
without dropping a set in the
process.

In doubles the Generals
dominated the play as they did
in singles. The number three
team of Keesler and Makepeace
lost a mere six games in their
three match romp. Ken Voelker
and Pat Norris glided to victory
(with what is a clinch by this
time) without dropping a set in
the number two doubles
championship round. The
number one team of Johns and
Jackson struggled with Quarles

-

and Lynchbury by only 5 and 7
strokes respectively after the
first 18 holes. At that point the
W&L linkmen burned the other
two teams in the second 18 holes
and finished the tournament
leading runner-up Lynchburg
by 20 strokes and third place
Hampden-Sydney by 24 strokes.
Also participating were Ran-
dolph-Macon, Bridgewater,
Roanoke, and Emory and
Henry.

W&L’s big victory assured the
Generals the lion’s share of
post-season honors. Leading the
way was sophomore Dave
Leunig who had the best two
round socres (148) and the only
par round of the tournament
(71). Because of this excellent
performance, Dave was named
ODAC Player of the Year. W&L

also had the second place
finisher in the tournament in
junior team captain Jerry

and Summerlin of Hampden-
Sydney before triumphing 6-1, 6-
7 (4-5), 7-5.

Coach Dennis Bussard also
got into the winner’s circle
being named the ODAC coach-
of-the-year. However, Bussard
is quick to point out that,
“Senior Ken Voelker and junior
Ben Johns have provided a
great deal of leadership and
experience in helping the fresh-
men play to their potential.”’
One telltale of how successful
the tennis season will be is how
the Generals play in the half
dozen upcoming matches
against far stronger opponents
than those of the ODAC. A .500
or better season will be a major
accomplishment for a team that
is carrying four freshmen in the
starting lineup. Once again in
the final standings W&L ran
away with the ODAC cham-
pionship with 27 points,
distantly followed by Hampden-
Sydney, 14, Emory and Henry,
11, Randolph-Macon, 6,
Bridgewater, 4, Eastern
Mennonite, 1, Roanoke, 0. and
Lynchburg, 0.

To Nationals?

Maatman who shot a solid 150 to
be named to the All-Conference
Team. Coach Leslie praised
Jerry for playing well under
pressure from circumstances
unrelated to golf. Also named to
the All-Conference Team were
Gary Barousse and Terry
Shadrick by virtue of their 153
totals. Barousse, a freshman,
has surprised many with his
consistently good play this year.
Shadrick, a junior, helped lead
the Generals second round
charge with a one-over-par 72,
the second best round of the
tournament. Also aiding the
cause was sophomore Andy
Fitzgerald whose _ scores
counted in both rounds. Coach
Leslie praised Andy for
bouncing back strongly this
season after ‘‘a tough start.”
Finally Coach Leslie was
named Coach of the Year for his
part in the W&L triumph.

Baseball Team
Drops Two

by Jerry Harris

You have heard about the
vicious circle in sociology,
polites, economics and various
other academic areas. Now add
a new type of vicious circle —
that of the Washington and Lee
baseball team. After dropping
two games in four outings last
week, head mentor Joe Lyles
was meaning over the effects of
just such a cycle.
such a cycle.

On Saturday the Generals
were defeated by visiting
Emory & Henry 5-0 in the first
game of a doubleheader while
battling to an unusual 6-6 tie at
the end of 13 innings in the
nightcap. Tuesday W&L
travelled to Eastern Mennonite,
winning 17-4 and losing 3-1. This
gave the batmen a 4-15-1 mark
for the season.

relatively tough qualifying time
of sub-3 hours (that’s equivalent

than 7 minutes per mile).
Despite this fact 3100
marathoners came to Boston
April 19 for the annual affair.

It was a great day for watch-

for running. The temperature
was in the upper 70’s to about 80

The victory was especially
sweet for the team since they
had not been favored to win. A
2% week layoff hurt the team in
the State Tournament (held
April 8th, 9th and 10th) although
they finished strongly to place

crowd watching the race as in
excess of 1 million. They must
have been right. From the time
the gun went off until the finish
line in downtown Boston, the
course was lined with spec-
tators 10 feet deep on each side.
The start was slow; it took me 4
minutes just to get across the
starting line after the gun. You
spend the first few miles
hemmed in by other runners.
With very little running room at
first, you later have a whole two
lane road to run on.

For the last 15 miles however,
the crowds got almost un-
controllable — hemming us into
a corridor 5-10 feet wide. You
are almost completely en-
veloped by a screaming crowd
exhorting you onward with
clenched fists, sliced oranges,

‘cups of water, etc.. It borders
between utter exhilaration and
terror! One of the most exciting
parts of the course is alongside
the Wellesley campus — the
whole student body was out in
force cheering madly for each
woman runner and politely
applauding the men.

The ending was amazing. You
round a bend and enter a square
in which 100,000 people are
screaming for you (sort of like a

well in the victory over Eastern
Mennonite. Buzby and
Bonaventure both connected for
home runs against EM to ac-
count for two of the team’s 15
hits. Danny Westbrook
recorded the victory in a strong
pitching performance. But, as
Lyles pointed out, such efforts
have been sporadic so far this
season.

Contrary to most losing
teams, the Generals have not
been hurt by a lack of talent,
poor pitching or inexperience.
Instead, it is the little things like
double plays and back-t-back
hits that have plagued W&L
thus far.

Lyles said, “Our main cause
of so many losses has been
hitting. We’re getting the hits
but they are spaced out.”
Because of this, he noted, extra
pressure has been put on the
relatively young pitching staff
of the Generals.

Meanwhile, the lack of runs
has pressured the defense to
play tight, which causes a lot of
errors. The errors: make the
pitcher afraid to throw strikes
and after a while you have a
complete breakdown of the
team. Add to this some injuries,
sickness of key players and a
break of 2 days in the middle of
the season with no playing and
you have a picture of misery.

But the team has shown some
signs of improvement of late.
And with several games
remaining on the schedule, the
Generals could still salvage this
season. They merely need to
find a way out of this vicious
circle.

“Mecca” for Schwab — ¢9.Captains Named

Rising seniors Pat Dennis and
Bob Forlenza have been elected
by their teammates as co-
captains for the 1977-78
basketball Generals. Coach
Verne Verne Canfield an-
nounced the selections at the
teams’ annual banquet held last
Wednesday at Lexington’s
Keydet-General Motel.

Dennis is a 6-2 hot-shooting
guard from Towson, Md. In

1976-77, Pat led the team in

scoring with a 21.7 ppg average,
and was voted W&L’s MVP. He
was also a third team All-
American, Conference Player
of the Year, and named
Virginia’s outstanding College
Division Player.

Forlenza is a 5-10 guard from
Sea Girt, New Jersey, and has
been nominated for Academic
All-American honors this
season. He split playing time
this season at point guard with

starter Mike Wenke and
graduating co-captain Kim
Sims.

The 1976-77 team finished at
23-5, were ranked fourth
nationally, and won the ODAC
Title. In conjunction with those
accolades, the following awards
were presented at the banquet:
Best Defensive Player — Bob

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

‘..a climate of learning that stresses the im-

portance of the individual, his personal honor and
integrity...”’

—from the University’s formal statement

of institutional philosophy

What a laugh.

I resisted the idea for a long time, despite the in-
creasingly overwhelming volume of irrefutable
evidence. I didn’t want to believe it, it couldn’t hap-
pen, not here at Washington and Lee. But the con-
clusion is finally unavoidable:

The faculty and administration of this University
are bent on destroying every shred of personal
freedom and individual responsibility ever accorded
its students. What’s worse is that they are succeeding,
and that we are powerless to stop them.

Sound extreme? I hope so, though I may have just
lost what few friends on the F&A I had. Listen:
they’re trying to take away independent exams. Not
that we couldn’t get along without them; students at
most places never heard of such things. They’re a
luxury. It would be far simpler just to sit back and let
them tell us what we have to do. No long lines at
Newcomb, no danger of students taking their exams
over to the library so they can look everything up, no
agonizing over whether to take the easiest exam first
or last, no sweat, no problem, everything’s taken care
of, except...

Except that it turns the University’s “formal
statement of institutional philosophy’ into a
hypocritical lie. The faculty contend that individual
exams encourage cheating. And so they do. All exams
encourage cheating. (A general invective against
exams is tempting but inappropriate here.) In-
dependent exams also encourage not cheating, and
for a reason that is far more important (if we are to
take the University’s statement seriously) than fear
of being caught. That is: pride in one’s own integrity
and the knowledge that one is totally responsible for
one’s actions. Cheating is bound to occur under any
exam system. Independent exams allow one to choose
not to cheat. The ‘honorable’ course — not cheating
— can hardly be called honorable if it is not a matter
of individual choice.

And now for the really bad news: there’s not a
damn thing we can do about it. Exams, like courses
and degrees, athletics, and the calendar (remember
that debacle?) are totally subject to the whim of the
faculty. Student opinion and feeling have no effect
whatsoever on the faculty’s decisions concerning
students. We haven’t a single vote in these matters;
the University Council, where clown and gown meet,
can only suggest to the faculty that students might
have something to say about the way they are taught,
tested, and graded. The Executive Committee’s
suggestion that some faculty members might not
fully understand the Honor System was received with
something like open hostility by professors who seem
convinced of the infallability of their own logic.

I am always amazed when a principle that ought to
be fundamental and universal (in terms of the
University community, you understand) suddenly
rises to the surface and becomes a debatable issue.
Most of this B. S. was sorted out in the rest of the
academic world five to ten years ago. For the hapless
student at W&L, it may be too late to recover those
rights which never should have been called into

question.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

On the
Boxwoods

Editor:

All alumni who might read
this in the Ring-tum Phi are
urged to hurry to Lexington for
a last look at Washington and
Lee. From the look of things
now the entire campus will soon
be buried under masses of
boxwoods. Walking to class is
becoming difficult act to per-
form because I have been
having nightmares about being
lost in an endless tnagle of four
smelling shrubs.

I mean no disrespect to the
late Mr. Poinor; his warm
feelings for Washington and Lee
are greatly appreciated.
However, the campus is only so
big. Is the next step a potted
boxwood for every professors’
office?

Mr. Parsons has indicated the
disadvantages to the university
on several occasions. His latest
comment that the boxwoods
“give maturity to the land-
scape”’ was therefore a surprise
and in my view wrong. Couldn’t
we either decline the offer of the
additional boxwoods' with
thanks or donate them to
somebody else who could make
better use of them? I am sick to
death of boxwoods. Enough is
enough!

I do, of course, have better
things to do than complain
about the superfluity of box-
woods at Washington and Lee.
It’s too bad Washington and Lee

has nothing better to do than
bury us in boxwoods.

As recently as this past
weekend, one more. of

Washington and Lee’s favorite
sons took his first step toward
fame and fortune. On Saturday
evening down at the Hollins

Ind. Exams Threatened

(continued from page 1)

Dr. Cook is not just
speculating on the cheating, or
to be more specific, the
collusion during exams. He
says, ‘I have heard many of my
colleagues here in the ac-
counting department and other
departments as well complain
about the independent exam
schedule. It is not difficult to see
what they are complaining
about either. For example, the
morning exam schedule is from
9-12 a.m. How could a student
walk in at 10:30 knowing that he
can finish his exam in an hour
and a half. Or take another
example. Last year during the
exam period a dorm counselor
yelled across the freshman
quad to another student that he
did not need to read a certain
’ chapter in order to prepare for
an exam. That is certainly an
honor violation.”’

One professor chose to define
the problem of independent
exams as a problem of leakage
and policing. It took him little
time to think of an example.
“One time,” he said, ‘‘I gave an
exam on a very difficult book,
so difficult that I only used it
one year. Anyway most of my
A-students came in and took the

exam on Saturday and really
struggled with it. Then later in
the week my C and D-students
came in and breezed right
through it. Unfortunately, such
results make me tend to distrust
these students. Certainly it is

possible for a student to im-
prove over the year. But after a
few tests you can generally tell
how a particular student will
score. And we are not just
talking about twelve to fifteen
students in collusion. We’re
talking about sixty perhaps
even eighty students in
collusion. Obviously, this
gravely penalizes the honest
student. Yet when or how will
the student Executive Com-
mittee police this problem.’’

On the other hand, it would be
incorrect to say that the faculty
is of one mind, that is, that
independent exams must be
eliminated. Some professors
sharply disagree claiming that
they have not seen any signs of
such cheating. While it is
somewhat more difficult to
administrate independent
exams the professors see them
as worthwhile because of the
advantage with which they
provide students. In fact most
professors like the idea of in-
dependent exams. They simply
disagree on whether or not
independent exams lead to
more cheating.

Of some importance, too, are
the opinions of the students.
Sandy Stadtman, vice president
of the Executive Committee
(who was quoted last week in
the Ring-tum Phi as saying that
the problem of independent
exams resulted from _ the
faculties misunderstanding of
the Honor System) was anxious

to clear up any misun-
derstandings. ‘‘I did not mean
to say that the faculty is
ignorant of the Honor System
and I’m sorry if anyone got that
impression. Nevertheless the
faculty and the student
Executive Committee do not
always seem to be following the
same Honor Code. I’m _ not
putting the blame on one side or
the other. What I am saying is
that the disagreement is
primarily the result of a lack of
communication.”’

Stradtman, then, moved on
and addressed himself to the
question of how the elimination
of the independent exams would
affect the entire Honor
system.”’ Since the question of
independent exams has been
raised, other problems have
arisen. Can we say that a
student who cheats on his
exams does not cheat anywhere
else? Perhaps we’re just kid-
ding ourselves if we really
believe that cheating does not
exist.”’

At any rate this problem will
be brought up in one form or
another when the faculty meets
to vote on independent exams
this Monday.

Noell announces resignation;
accepts job at UVa

After nearly seven years as
associate dean of Washington
and Lee, William A. Noell has
announced that he will be
leaving the school. Noell has
accepted a similar position with
the University of Virginia’s law
school in Charlottesville. In his
new job, Noell said he will be
working in the financial aid
department while doing some
admissions work. He also will
be conducting regular seminars
in legal writing for first year
law students.

Noell came to W&L from a
law practice in Washington D.
C. in 1970. He is a graduate from
the UVa law school and said his
“close relationship with the law
school’’ was his main reason for
leaving his W&L post.

“It wasn’t an easy decision to
make,’’ Noell said when asked
why he decided to make his
move. “I hope I’ve made the
right decision.”

Professor of English, H.
Robert Huntley has been chosen
to take the place of Noell.
Huntley, a graduate of the
University of Wisconsin, has
been with the school for 15
years, joining the staff in 1962.

Huntley said the full impact of
his selection has not yet hit him.
He said he has always been
interested in admissions work
and has done small amounts of
recruitment for the past seven
years.

He said he will not have
regular classes next year and
instead will conduct an English
seminar on Monday mornings
so that the rest of his week can
be dedicated to recruitment
purposes.

Huntley said two and possibly
three new English professors
will be added to next year’s
staff to take up the slack that
has been created by his and
fellowEnglish professor Ed

New orders, transfer
ROTC instructors

by Reid Slaughter

Having received new orders
by the Army, three of
Washington and Lee’s ROTC
instructors, Col. Louis P. Mc-
Fadden, Capt. John K. Miller
and Maj. Wolf Kutter, will be
leaving this year after a short
but productive stay.

The three men have been
teaching at W&L for three, four,
and three years respectively.
During this time, enrollment in
ROTC has tripled, and the
program itself has undergone a
complete facelift. ‘Over the
past three years, the depart-
ment as a whole has generated
genuine concern for the
student,” said Maj. Kutter,
“also, we have cut out un-
necessary regulations for fresh-
man and sophomores such as
short hair, marching and
drilling and substituted ac-
tivities like rappelling and sky-
diving.”

Overall, the three men have
stressed building leadership
qualities into the ROTC
students, while making it ‘fun to
learn’. In addition, the in-
structors themselves have been
more readily available to the
students and tried to keep the
department abrest of the
current status of the Army with
its myriad of operations.

One instance is in the
departments push for more
ROTC students to go into the
Reserves. ‘“The Army looks far
beyond the use of force as an

instrument of national policy,”’
stated Kutter, “‘if the force level
is great enough to deter an
attack, then you have avoided
war without fighting. The effort
now is to shore up the Reserve
components; the active Army
has an ample number of combat
officers.”

The destinations of the three
men are very different. Col.
McFadden, the chairman of the
department, is retiring after 20
years of military service. He

The skies cleared, the
weather turned warm, and
there was mystery in the air.
Older men with little name tags
on their lapels filled the Cock-
pit, a driver was dispatched to
Roanoke in search of 50 dozen
petit fours, Mercedes,
Cadillacs, and Rolls Royces

sprung up everywhere solemnly
directing the attention of all to
the ominous LEWIS HALL,
home of the W&L legal eagles.
Something big was about to
happen, and it did.

Numerous wide-eyed faculty
members and red-eyed alumni
were milling about waiting
anxiously for the fun to begin.
The question on everyone’s lips,
‘“‘when are they going to tap that

At 11:30 President Huntley
made a move toward the
podium, the multitude took
their places and waited
patiently. No sooner had Liz
Taylor and John Warner taken
their seats next to me when

President Huntley called the
ceremony to order.

All bowed their heads in
reverence as Dr. John Newton

invocation in a fine fire-and-

Huntley introduced E. Marshall

and land animals,

by Dr. Hickman of the Biology
Department.

 

Almost one hundred and fifty
years ago, Charles Darwin
ventured to the Galapogos
Islands to study the animal life
there and to develop his theory
of evolution. His studies in 1835
prompted the voyage of other
biologists to the 16 volcanic
islands and associated inlets 600
miles from the coast of Equator
to observe the amazingly tame
wildlife unspoiled by the in-

Sixteen biology students from
Washington and Lee joined the
pilgrimage and traveled to the
islands in the Pacific for a first-
hand look at the unique birds
whose
existence is as undisturbed now
as it was during Darwin’s time.
The 16 were divided into two
groups of eight, and led around
the islands for intensive in-
dependent research, directed

Bio students lost
for three days

On March 30th, the first group
arrived at the Darwin Research
Station to begin their one month
of study. The Research Station
was a Starting point, where the
students underwent two days of
briefings before they embarked
on the real part of their journey
— sojourns to the different
islands to observe the wildlife in
its natural habitat. The Darwin
finch, the friget bird, iguanas,
tortoises, and the rare wood-
pecker finch (which uses a
barbed stick to pry its insect
victims from their hiding places
in trees. were all targeted for
study, unique from other birds
and animals because they have
not yet learned to fear man.

Living aboard a yacht, the
group would awaken every
morning at 5:30, breakfast, then
take a boat into one of the
islands for research until 11
o’clock. A swim, lunch, and rest
period would occupy the hottest
part of the day. Research would

Frantic housing race starts

by Lee Howard

Watch out. It is the time for
the mad, last-minute dash to
phones and cars as Washington
& Lee students look for housing.

Of course many students have
their apartments, farm houses

Of course many students have
their

Of course many students have
their apartments, lette

Of course many students have
their apartments, farm houses
or fraternity houses set for next
year. But independent fresh-
men, particularly, must find
apartments or roommates
before the end of the school
year. That’s where Mr. William
Mohler, director of university
services comes in. He helps
coordinate housing for W&L
students.

He helps coordinate housing
in a number of ways. First, he is
solely responsible for assigning
rooms controlled by the
university to upperclassmen
and law school students. This
means he controls the Woods
Creek Apartments, Lee I & II
and the Baker and Davis dorms.
Also, he puts out a list of
available housing in the
Lexington area.

However, Mohler’s list of
housing is not very descriptive.
It breaks housing down into four
categories: furnished rooms,
furnished apartments, un-
furnished apartments and
houses for rent. In most cases it
merely states the landlord’s
name and phone number and
the property’s address. Also,
the list is not necessarily up to
date since the only way the
Office of University Services
knows whether an apartment
has been taken is if the landlord
calls and tells them to take the
apartment off the list.

The Office of University
Services also does not get itself
involved in rental negotiations
or any other legal battle. An
exception to this was when a
black W&L student was denied
housing because of his race.
University Services lawyers
intervened in that case and
straightened it out, said Mr.
Mohler. But normally, as the
housing list says, ‘Matters
concerning rents, deposits,
rules, maintainance, utilities
and so forth must necessarily be
resolved privately between the
tenant and landlord.”

The housing list also makes it
clear that ‘“‘The Office of
University Services acts solely
as a clearing-house for in-
formation on accommodations.
The University cannot inspect
such facilities for adequacy,
and neither can it offer en-
‘dorsements or assume other
responsibility over them.” It
does not say on the list why the
Office of University Services
cannot inspect the facilities,
although Mohler makes it clear
that it is more a lack of time
than anything else. Still, Mohler
says he believes he is per-
forming a valuable service for

students.

areas of women law student
housing and married housing.

The Office of University
Services is having problems
accommodating persons in the
areas of women law student
housing and married housing.
Mohler says finding places that
can accommodate the growing
number of women law students
will be a problem in the future.
Right now he has four Woods
Creek Apartments and five
twin-room apartments in Baker
dorm filled with women he said.
Mohler also said the university
lacks adequate space for
married law students. He said
he forsees the possibility of the
next university apartment
complex being a married
housing complex.

The university’s lone modern
apartment facility, Woods
Creek, is doing very well, says
Mohler. All the apartments are
filled for next year, he says. He
adds enthusiastically that
students seem to like it over
there. Damage to the apart-
ments has been minimal, he
says, and when a student has
knocked in a door during a
drunken stupor he has always
come in and payed his fine like a
gentleman.

Mohler says 12 of the 40
Woods Creek apartments this
year are inhabited by law
school students. He sees a
natural trend toward more law
school students inhabiting
Woods Creek because of the

convenient location but he says
he might have to put restraints
on the trend in order to give
undergraduates a chance to live
in Woods Creek. However, he
says a time may come when he
will set aside the central
building of the complex solely
for law students.

Another trend which he sees
is a trend toward students
wanting to live on campus. A
few years ago, he says, it was
deemed glamourous to live as
far away from campus as
possible. Mohler says he
worried when students got too
far afield and likes the on-
campus trend because students
can become more a part of the
campus. Unfortunately, as
Mohler’s secretary Monica
Hoke points out, there are more
campus than there are apart-
ments on campus available for
them.

However, there should be
enough housing on campus for
next year’s freshman class. The
university is trying to work the
school size back down to a more
manageable 1,300 and will not
have to house anyone at the
Robert E. Lee Hotel as they did
this year, according to several
sources.

While next year’s freshman
class is set, this year’s fresh-
man class will continue the mad
scramble for housing. One
freshman told me, “I haven’t
even begun to think about where
I’m going to live next year.”
The Ring-tum Phi hopes this
article starts you thinking.
And dialing. And checking out
the housing list in Mr. Mohler’s
office.

Tune tastes revealed

by Rex Nyquist

Are you wondering whatever
happened to that questionnaire
you filled out for the Student
Activities Board about two
weeks ago? The one that asked
you what type of music you

liked?

Chances are you’re not,
because you probably did not
complete it. In fact, only 20 per
cent of the student body

responded to the questionnare,

so that SAB decided to discard

the survey. ‘There was not
enough response to do
anything,” said Mike Arm-
strong, Co-chairman of the
SAB.

It was the second time this
year that an SAB poll pertaining
to the musical tastes of students
were circulated and _ not
published. The results of the fall
survey were never released
because the individual who was
in charge of administering it
dropped out of school, the SAB
reported.

Nevertheless, Armstrong
thinks that it is safe to assume
that the musical preferences of

st 08482 4H 24048 288 24S

students are about the same as
they were last year, when an
SAB poll revealed slightly more
than 60 per cent of the student
body preferred rock and
variations of rock (like County
rock and progressive rock),
while slightly less than 40 per
cent enjoyed soul. A much
smaller percentage liked
Country and Bluegrass better.

Armstrong based his opinion
on a survey given to the fresh-
man class in late March and
early April. The results were
similar to last years poll; a
majority-about 60 per cent —
prefers rock music and a strong
minority — about 40 per cent
leans toward soul. He said:
“One class’ is_ pretty
representative of the other,”
and that it is safe to presume
that rock is the choice of most
Washington and Lee students.

Armstrong said that this
year’s SAB spent about $30,000
for rock bands, and perhaps
some soul groups should come
to campus next year, though
that will be up to next years
SAB.

Underhill states E.C. aims

President-elect of the student
body, Jim Underhill, believes
the honor system works, but
feels that it has some gray
areas that need to be cleared
up. He hopes that under his
administration the new E. C.
will approach this problem with
perhaps more fervor than E.
C.’s of late.

In an informal discussion with
the RtP Monday, Underhill
began by saying he disagrees
with the way in which this
year’s E. C. handled honor
cases.

“This year’s E. C. was too
philosophical in the way it
handled the honor cases. I
believe next year’s E. C. will
want to come out of the
theoretical cloud and get back
to the basics of the honor
system and stick to the White
Book. We want to restore in the
student body a sense of con-
fidence in the E. C. and impress
upon them that they have a
strong E. C. By sticking to the
White Book, I believe we can do
this.”’

Underhill also would like to
make the E. C. more accessible
to the student body. He feels
that in the recent past, the E. C.
has been out of touch with the
student body, and he wants to be
able to acquaint each student
with the E. C.’s expectations for
next year’s honor system.

“I think every student should
know the members of the E. C.,
not only ‘in a working capacity,
but also in a personal capacity.
I also believe the E. C. should
try to do something extra for the
students. I don’t know exactly
what. Maybe a bus trip to the
lacrosse playoffs, as I proposed
tonight, or possibly a party for
the student body. The big thing
is that next year’s E. C. wants to
be open to student opinion and

suggestions and would ap-
preciate input as to how to
improve our service to them.

‘“T have thought about
possibly sending E. C. members
to fraternity houses to hold
candid discussions on and about
the honor system. We’re open to
suggestions.”

Underhill continued, ‘After
conferring with some faculty
and trustees, I have decided to
conduct a survey over the
summer, independent of the E.
C. to find out from the students
just what type of shape the
honor system is in...The survey
is being conducted by the
faculty, board of trustees, and
myself, with the students
guaranteed that no risk will be
involved in it for them. The
survey will be held with no
names used. This should insure
honest responses.’’

Another goal for Underhill is
for the E. C. to acquaint the
faculty with their respon-
sibilities to the honor system
and obtain their feelings and
ideas about the system. He feels
that communication between
the faculty and E. C. has been
nonexistent and would like to
see this change.

“George (Griffin) and I plan
on going to every faculty
member and getting his views
and suggestions on the honor
system. And in some areas, we
would like for them to recom-
mend policy. Example: How
should we treat a student who
hands in an exam late? or How
do we handle a student who
makes qualitiative remarks
about an exam? The’-faculty
have been expecting us to
decide these issues and we feel
that we need their advice on
matters such as these.”

Though not wanting to speak
for the other E. C. members,

swim coach over the past four
years in which the swim team
has enjoyed tremendous suc-
cess, producing several All-
Americans. McFadden intends
to attend Washington and Lee
law school, where he will be a
high freshman.

A 1967 graduate of W&L,
Capt. Miller will be heading to
Fulda, Germany where he will
serve as Personnel Officer for a
Special Administration Control
Unit. Miller was an instructor of
military history at W&L.

Maj. Kutter has been selected
to attend the Arms Forces Staff
College in Norfolk, Virginia, a

highly competitive school
operated by the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. It is equivalent to a
Masters degree, emphasizing
the joint military problems
from both a factual and
theoretical view. The school
lasts about six months, and
after that, Kutter is unsure
about his future.

Along with his military
science courses, Kutter taught a
course in the C school. He holds
a degree in corporate finance,
and has received numerous
offers at the corporate level, but
‘wants to finish out his 20 years
with the military before any
further decisions are made.

All three men have expressed
their deep appreciation to the
faculty of W&L which has been
very supportive of the
ROTC program. As Maj.
Kutter put it, ‘The institutional
philosophy of academic ex-
cellence has been integrated
into the program and it’s great.
W&L has a rich tradition in
service to the nation — whether
it be in law, politics, medicine
or the military. This has been
an overwhelming reason why
the ROTC program at
Washington and Lee is con-
sidered one of the finest
anywhere.”’

Alumni toast Lewis Hall

(continued from page 1)

since they couldn’t get Dean
Stienheimer out of it anyway he
would go ahead and make a
formal dedication.

The next speaker on the
agenda was Lewis F. Powell
Jr., associate justice of the U. S.
Supreme Court. He received a
standing ovation, quite a tribute
on such a hot day. In his
remarks he said that never
since George Washington has
such a gift meant so much to
W&L. He then rattled off an
impressive list of judges who
had attended W&L law school.
President Huntley then asked
Sydney Lewis, the man who
made it all happen, to say a few
words. After a disorganized
attempt at finding his speech,
Lewis apologized saying that
‘“‘what I had to say didn’t want
to come out of my pocket.”
Lewis told the history behind his
gift saying that after he and

Francis let it during his years’

as a student at W&L President
Gaines impressed on every
student how they were not fully
paying for their education. He
said that right after he and his
wife informed W&L of their
wish to make some con-
tribution, Dr. Jack Thomas was
knocking at their door. Lewis
said that the Huntley’s invited
them to Lexington for a
weekend which ended with a
short walk around the new
model of the law school
building. On the ride home

eee 08 € 89 4S UF

decided to make an investment
in the future by giving the entire
sum needed to build the law
school. Frances Lewis also
made a short speech about
loyalty and her hope and vision
for the law school. When she
was finished they gave her a
standing ovation. President
Huntley thanked them again
saying they drove an easy
bargain.

By the time Dean Steinheimer
began his speech, the sun had
taken its toll; eyes began to
close, heads fell, and the
reporters tried to get up a card
game. Then the magic moment,
it was over and all stampeded
toward the keg of choice Scotish
nectar. President Huntley
announced that this part of the
ceremony was not to have the

attributes of the American

cocktail party and that only
ceremonial portions would be
given out. The sighs of despair
echoed through the peaceful
valley. The beautiful people
mingled about with tin cups in
hand. Lunch was_ served
alfresco by the worlds infamous
Institutions Foods Co. of
Lexington.

All good things must come to
an end and this was no ex-
ception. President Huntley had
said Dr. Thomas had been
responsible for the fine
weather. Unfortunately his
heavenly bargain was not a
good one because hardly had

rain. A mad dash for the
parking lots. One well dressed
lady with a deep southern ac-

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

Faculty requests honor

violation stats from EC

Independent exams could be
scrapped as early as the Fall
term, said Jim Underhill at
Monday’s Executive Com-
mittee meeting. The Ring-tum-
Phi had stated last week that
the earliest possible can-
cellation of independent exams
would be in the Winter term.

Also at Monday’s meeting,
the E. C. voted 5-3, with one
abstension, to hold their annual
banquet, rarher than rescind
the money appropriated for the
party in favor of a variety of
other suggestions for its use.
The suggestions for other uses
of the money were for:
repairs on the _ universal
weight-lifting machine in the
gym, another school grain party
and transportation for students
to a lacrosse play-off game (if it
is not played at home).

Underhill said the final
determination of whether in-
dependent exams will be kept
will be made in November at a
Faculty Executive Committee
meetjng. In the meantime the
Faculty E. C. requested from
the E.C. statistics on the
number of honor violation
complaints, trials and con-
victions related to independent
exams, Underhill said. He said
the faculty would try to
determine from the statistics
whether independent exams are
harmful to the honor system.

Walt Kelly said he wondered
whether not giving the faculty
the information they desired
would prejudice them against
independent exams. Refusing to
give the faculty the information
“might alienate some swing
votes,” said Kelly.

Underhill agreed, although he
said he thought a more
“valuable” evluation of the
honor system will be a poll he,
in cooperation with the ad-
ministration, is planning to take
over the summer which will ask
students to evaluate the honor
System anonymously. He said
he believes an anonymous poll
will get honest answers.

“I don’t think we should give
the faculty anything,’’ said Rick
Goddard. The only statistic that
would be valuable for the
faculty would be the number of
convictions vs. the number of
trials, he said. The number of
honor violation complaints were
totally unfounded, said God-
dard. Even the number of
convictions vs. the number of
trials is a sort of “batting
average’, said Goddard, and
not really worthwhile in itself

because the students who were
acquitted were acquitted
because of insufficient

evidence.
Radar Davis noted that the E.

C. published similar statistics
last year and said that many
students saw the E. C. as a
“CIA-type organization”’ that is
trying to protect itself. Davis
said that the statistics ‘‘aren’t
deleterious at all’ and should be
published to show the E. C. has
nothing to hide.

Finally, two motions were
considered. The first, presented
by Neil Pentifallo, called on the
E. C. to provide the faculty with
statistics only on how many
independent exam-related
cases have gone to trial and how
many convictions have resulted
from the trials. That motion
passed 7-2. The second, sub-
mitted by Walt Kelly, called on
the E. C. to give the faculty all
the statistics they originally
requested that Passed 5-4.

Tony Carli brought a petition
to the E. C. with the signatures
of 99 students asking the E. C.
not to hold its year-end party.
He said he thought this was a
significant number of students
because he had not actively
sought out signatures but just
posted the petition in the dining
hall. He said a petition written

up by George Griffin
saying the undersigned
students would be

happy to pay for the E. C. party
out Of their own pocket had
received only 18 signatures, if
you included a variety of
profane remarks. Griffin said
he had 23 signatures on another
petition.

Walt Kelly said ‘‘Ninety-nine
people; that’s about a sixteenth
of the whole school.’’ have you
ever taken a course in
statistics,” he asked. He said
that one sixteenth of the
university is hardly a
significant number.

However Pentifallo, who
signed Carli’s petition, said he
thought the issue was important
enough to be discussed. He said
he had “‘problems”’ with the E.
C. appropriating money for its
own party. Paul Larkin also
said he felt the issue should be
discussed because students
have a legitimate gripe that
student funds are being used for
a private party, rather than for
something the whole student
body could enjoy.

Goddard suggested the $250
could be used for repairing the
universal weight-lifting
machine. Members of the E. C.
objected because the machine
belongs to the university rather
than to the student body and
because the reparations would
not cost as much as $250. They
voted down Goddard’s proposal
7-1. Underhill then suggested a
grain party for the school could
be payed for out of what is left in
the student fund — about $400,
according to Tom Hunter, E. C.
president. Then Underhill said
another possibility would be for
the E. C. to appropriate money
for bus transportation to an
away play-off lacrosse game.

Neither of Underhill’s
Suggestions were taken up
because George’ Griffin
suggested that the E. C. vote on

Entertainment Editor
The theatrical seasons of the
late 1940’s that produced Death
of a Salesman and the other
blockbuster works of Arthur
Miller and Tennessee Williams
moved into a period of steady
slump in the 1950’s. Later, a few
seasons in the early 1960’s were
dubbed by some as the most
uneventful to hit (or land upon)
New York since the turn of the
century... To say that Broad-

way was losing money at that
time was a vast un-
derstatement, as_ theatres
closed, “‘hits’’ became fewer in
number, and the financial
backers — the “angels” —
became increasingly leery of
sinking vast sums of money into
the business.

There was no Drama Critics’
Circle Award in 1963-64, nor a
Pulitzer Prize that year, though
Arthur Miller’s After the Fall
served as the critical hit of the

year. Yet, this season brought
some much-needed vitality
back to the “eternal invalid’”’ —
however brief that spasm was.
The World’s Fair, soon to open,
provided the practical initiative
in terms of millions of tourists
who could fill theatres and
make successes.

Perhaps the best example of
this enthusiasm was a musical
which soon became one of the
stage’s all-time favorites:
Hello, Dolly! Opening in this
season, the show went through a
half-dozen leading ladies and
spanned the rest of the decade,
before achieving its final glory
as a Saran Wrap motion picture
starring Barbara Streisand.
The latter star was much more
in her element in the other hit
musical play of 1963-64, Funny
Girl, her own personal rocket to
success on stage and screen.

That season’s most successful
new comedy is also the second
Washington and Lee total
theatre production for the
spring: Neil Simon’s Barefoot
in the Park. Perhaps it makes,
through its success, just as
valid a comment on_ the
American state of mind in the
mid-sixties as Death of a
Salesman in the last boom days
of the 1940’s. But its success
stems from the exact opposite
corner — because it was the
least critical toward life in this
country.

As one critic said upon
leaving a performance of the
show! ‘Barefoot in the Park
was nothing more than a minor
quarrel between two young
newly-weds spiced with the
amusing responses to the sort of
physical discomforts New

W&L’s

by Jay W. McCann

This weekend Washington
and Lee will be delightfully
unfaithful to the spirit of its
dour Calvanist founders. It is
Spring, and young men’s fan-
cies turn to..., well, sex. But,
this is the constant, unshocking,
state of affairs in Lexington.
The real news is that the annual
skin flick has arrived, and will
be shown in duPont during this
week, ‘including Friday and
Saturday at 11:00 p.m.

Actually, this year we have
the privilege of viewing a
double feature: ‘‘Wet Rainbow’”’
and “‘Slip-up.”’ “Wet Rainbow”
stars the upstanding and
irrepressible Harry Reams.
Students from Cinncinnati and
Chattanooga are warned to stay
away, lest they be
prosecuted when they return to
those jurisdictions for the
Summer. In fact, should you be
questioned by the local con-
stabulary about the late night
goings on in duPont, an S. A. B.
spokesman suggests you
memble something about
“private showings’ of “art

“Art films”

films.”

I don’t find this type of movie
entertaining in itself. The
women have that ‘“‘used’’ look,
and generally wear tatoos; the
men all look like convicts. The
amusing experience is listening
to the comments made by the
audience. These usually range
from the banal, ‘‘Rip her
clothes off!’’ to the enigmatic,
“You ain’t got no bazookas
honey!’’ Whatever either of
these statements may mean, it
is the way they are shouted that
is important. That’s the point, it
is the experience of going to a
porn flick that is essential. If
there were no porn flicks, we
would all dress up like Satyrs
and run around with giant phalli
strapped to our bodies like the
ancient Greeks.

Then again, if you can walk
down 42nd street and through
Times Square, and remain
unamazed, then maybe it is the
innocence of porn films in
Lexington that remains
fascinating.

SAB film

plans discussed

The coming year will see an
even better selection of films on
campus, according to Film
Committee Co-chairman Glen
Stanford, This is no mean task,
as this year’s group was very
well received by the student
body, and was indeed a record
year for response by students.

“Our basic plan for im-
provement for next year is
summed up in the recent SAB
questionnaire,’’ commented
Stanford. ‘“‘Obviously, the best
assurance of getting large
audiences is to cater to their
particular tastes. But, at the
same time, we will try to
provide a balance between
mystery and _ suspense,
musicals, comedy, and so
forth.”’

As always, big box-office
attractions will play a sizeable
role in the choices made. Such
recent hits as Marathon Man
and Silent Movie will be
available for rental by the fall.
And these are just two out of a
large group of new releases —
though the campus hasn’t been
without a Mel Brooks creation
or a good thriller in its lineup for
a long time.

Another movie coming up for
discussion is Gone With the
Wind, which has been visualized
for a four-night run; due to its
length, this particular film

 

“(DEATH OF A SALESMAN” —

would only allow one showing
per night. For those who
haven’t seen it aside from the
commercial-broken, small
screen version shown last fall, it
would come as a welcome
event.

And then there are the Cock-
pit movies. In the past, they
haven’t really attracted the
attention they deserved, for
some of the presentations were
of high quality. “They are
simply flicks that we don’t want
to set up for an entire
weekend,” said Stanford. One of
the movies which is almost
certain to be booked for a Cock-
pit showing is Bringing Up
Baby, a Katharine Hepburn -
Cary Grant vehicle of the late
1930’s, and undoubtedly one of
the funniest movies ever made.
Further work will be done to
enhance the appeal of the Cock-
pit as an entertainment center
by its management; a section of
booths to the left of the front
entrance is slated to be
removed to provide a stage area
for movies and live en-
tertainment.

One reminder: the movies for
the upcoming year have not
been booked definitely as yet. If
there is something you would
like to see, speak to a member
of the SAB about it soon.

These include stair-climbing,
inadequate steam heat, and the
after-effects of an _ exotic

This very simplicity seems to
be the Neil Simon recipe for
success. His productions read
like a roll-call of all the favorite
productions at dinner theatres
in suburbs all over the country:
The Odd Couple, Plaza Suite,
Little Me, The Sunshine Boys,
and more. Audiences flock to
see his productions; in fact,
most of them begin laughing
before the curtain even goes
up...

calling the theatre at 463-9111, ext. 371.

THE NOSE KNOWS

From all reports the Lewis
Hall dedication must have been
quite a smash. If only the Nose
hadn’t had to attend another
function the same day, which
also involved drinking, but in
the pursuit of horseflesh.
Louisville is so lovely in the
Spring.

“For a time, some courtesy in
the order of approach was
observed. But the thirsty
multitude soon broke all
restraint, and armed with tin

cups, pitchers, basins, buckets
and a_ variety of dip-
pers...rushed for the barrel and
soon gave a glorius exhibition of
what free whiskey can do for the
noble creature made in the
image of God.”

Before long, however, two
men — “rolling on the ground
like swine” — knocked the keg
over, and the party was
abruptly over.

He (Jockey John Robinson,
provider of the nectar) was
aghast that ‘‘the unlimited hoi

photo by Mary Haycox
polloi should have rushed in and
perverted what was intended by
him for the taste and enjoyment
of gentlemen into a horrid riot
of the rabble.”

That is from an 1824 account
of the dedication of Washington
Hall. Except for the fact that
the university locked out the
“hoi polloi” this time, (un-
dergraduate students were not
invited) it will do to describe
last weekend. The gentry was
supplied with the tin cups,
dippers, pitchers and basins,
but the scotch whiskey flowed
like water, courtesy of Virginia
State Supreme Court Justice
Alex M. Harman.

(continued on page 10)

In a troubled decade full of
self-examination, it seems as
though the people of this
country put their feet down in
one respect. They were darned
if they were going to let their
entertainment tell them how to
live... So Laugh-In became the
nation’s top television program,
and Neil Simon had four
comedies playing
simultaneously on Broadway by
1967.

The current production here
at W&L appears to be shaping
into that same sure-fire Simon
success. It is a senior thesis
project, directed by major Bob
Carpentier. In the roles of his
newly-weds, who rent the attic
apartment in Manhattan, are
Paul Morella and Carol
Phemister. Morella’s a familiar
face to any regular of the
theatre this season, appearing
in both Uncle Vanya and
... Virginia Woolf. Ms.
Phemister made her first ap-
pearance with the UT last
season in The Visit, and we are
glad to see her return. But
providing an equally large part
of the evening’s hilarity will be

Ralph Bakshi has _ suc-

years in the future. So hold on to
your hats, Sci-fi and fantasy
freaks, this flick is a definite
must.

The name of the film is
Wizards. That ought to spark
the interest of anyone with a
good imagination. The story
revolves around a world so
distant in the future that
mankind is reduced to mutants
and elevated to elves, dwarves,
and fairies. (I guess they’ll be
around forever.) The cause of

in Lex

this contrast is the inevitable
nuclear holocuast that everyone
thinks is just around the corner.

The story is the best part of
the film. I’ll give you a short
and abridged edition so I won’t
spoil it for you as it has already
left Lexington. A particular
Delhia, Queen of the Fairies,
gives birth to two male off-
spring, one a good wizard and
the other a bad one. In typical
Tolkienesque style the fantasy
unfolds. The bad wizard is
expelled by his polarized
brother to Scortch, a rather
unpleasant version of Newcomb
Hall. As Blackwolf, the bad,
vegitates there he plots revenge
upon his good brother, Avatar.
He eventually unearths secrets
from the past and learns the
scret of mass hysteria, com-
pliments of the Nazis. At this
point in the flick, it does not look
good for the elves and friends.
Mr. Bakshi resorts to some
excellent animated carnage to
get this across. The brave
Avatar and his proteges set out
on a quest to destroy the thing
that gives Blackwolf his in-
credible powers of
psychological terror. That’s
where the fun begins. I
heapheartily encourage you to
go to a ‘‘theater near you’’ and
invest the necessary amount to
see this work. You shan’t regret
it.

Baseball team ends

The 1977 baseball season has
come to a close for the W&L
Generals. The team completed
their season with a 5-18-1 over-
all mark, after dropping their
final two games last week. W&L
lost to the Liberty Baptist
Flames 14-5, and to Newport
News Apprentice 8-3.

The Flames sent 13 men to the
plate in the top of the sixth with
nine of them hitting safely to go
with one W&L error. A three-

drops last two

run homer by leftfielder Joe
Pollock was the main blow. Co-
captain Ben Bonaventura went
2-4 at the plate with a double
and triple. DH Bob Szezecinski
and second baseman John
Stagmaier also had two hits.

The Generals dropped their
final game of the season to
Apprentice despite the fact that
the visitors could come up with
only ten hits. Freshman hurler

Fuzzballers to host
fall tournament

Already playing one of the
most difficult schedules of any
Division III school in the nation,
Coach Dennis Bussard an-
nounced last week that in Oc-
tober, W&L will host the First
Annual W&L University Fall
Invitational Tennis Tour-
nament.

In addition to the host
Generals, Ohio University, and
the Universities of Maryland
and Virginia will compete. The
tournament will be conducted in
quad fashion, with all four
schools playing each other in
head to head competition. The
177 tourney is set for October
2ist and 22nd on the W&L
courts.

The 1977 Generals split two
Division I matches last
weekend, defeating the
University of Pittsburgh 8-1,
and losing to Ohio U. 34.
Standout-freshman Stewart

Jackson won his second singles
matches in both contests, while

the number two doubles team of
captain Ken Voelker and Pat
Norris also won twice. Number
one singles player Ben Johns
won against Pitt, and took
Ohio’s Steve Navarro to the
third set before losing 7-6 with
the tie-breaker going 5-3 in
favor of Navarro.

Four W&L Generals will be
representing W&L in the
Division III National Cham-
pionships beginning on May
18th in Jackson, Miss. Johns
and Jackson carry W&L’s best
chances for national
recognition. This week, the
team has a Thursday match in
Annapolis with Navy, and plays
at Emory and Henry on
Saturday. The Generals are
currently 14-12 in dual match
action.

After six games in '77, W&L

track clubs expected

But there’s a new sport in town:
the first Ring-tum Phi Road
Race. The grueling 15 mile
mini-marathon has been set for
Saturday morning at 10 a.m.

According to the race’s
progenitor and organizer, RtP
editor Mike Gallagher, all the
proceeds from the two-dollar
entry fees will be given to the
Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Along with the entrants’ two
dollars, they will receive a free
tee shirt along with the right to
run the back roads of Lexington
in a trying test of muscles
versus mountains. First, second
and third place trophies will

also be presented to the stand-

outs of the race.

The race will begin at the
Lexington Court House on Main
Street. The deadline for the race
is about ten minutes before the
starter’s gun, therefore,
Gallagher has reported he
expects many last-minute
entries. He said, ‘I’m sure
there will be a number of
persons wanting to enter at the
last second just to get one of our
tee shirts, which is fine because
all the proceeds collected from
the purchase of the shirts goes
to a very needy and worthwhile
charity — the Multiple Sclerosis

Society.”’

Gallagher said the major
emphasis of the race will be on
safety while trying to provide
the entrants with some fun
competition. ‘‘We’ve had to
change the original route of the
race because at first the run-
ners were going to run part of
the race on Route 60. But after
several complaints about the
narrowness of that street, I
decided to change the the race’s
course slightly,’’ he said.

Other safety precautions have
been taken to insure the run-
ner’s safety. Monitors will be
placed at all _ strategic
crossroads to re-direct traffic
and direct the runners in the
right direction. Also, a complete
barrage of warning signs for
motorists will line the race
route. Gallagher said that the
Lexington - Rockbridge County
Rescue Squad will follow the
pack of runners as well as man
a station at the end of the 15-
mile trec to aid any winded
runners.

The Ring-tum Phi Road Race
has already attracted numerous
entrants from all around Rock-
bridge County. Gallagher said
that by Saturday, he would not

Stickmen win two
still ranked fifth

After rebounding from a 17-15
overtime loss to Maryland, the
W&L stickmen pulled off a
profitable week defeating
fourth-ranked college division
rival Roanoke College 11-8 and
Rutgers 13-8.

The outcome of both contests
was in doubt for the first half,
but as the Generals have done
so often this season, they came
on in the third quarter to seal
the victories. The Roanoke win
gave W&L the championship of
the South-Atlantic League, a
title that had gone to North
Carolina the past two seasons.
W&L defeated UNC 13-7 and
Roanoke to claim the top spot.

Roanoke is still waiting for
their first win over the

Generals, as W&L has now
beaten the Maroons nine
straight times. Washington and
Lee trailed 3-2 at the half, with
injured All-American defen-
seman Tom Keigler spending
most of the time on the bench
nursing a right arm injury.
Coach Jack Emmer inserted
“Doctor K’’ with the score tied
at 5-5, and he performed the -
operation to perfection as W&L
led 10-5 when “the Doctor”
returned to his spot on the
bench. His teammates sewed it
up on a goal by Jeff Fritz with
less than a minute to play.
Co-captain Jack Dudley and
attack Chris Kearney each had
three goals in the win, with
Chris Larson adding a goal and

Wa&L fencers parry

Hollins advances

by Pierre de Touche

The W&L Fencing Club had
its first intra-squad meet
Saturday, in which 5 fencers
from Hollins participated.
Trophies were awarded to the
ist and 2nd place finalists of the
43 match round-robin tour-
nament.

The tournament was held in
round-robin fashion rather than
direct elimination giving the
young swordsmen more ex-
perience. The fencers were
broken up into two groups with
the 2 most successful fencers
from each group meeting in a
round-robin finals match.

Will Wendt and Dave Garner
captured the two top positions
from group A, as did Herb
Jennings and Ron Brooks from
group B. Wendt, Garner, and
Jennings had little trouble in
securing their fence-off
positions, but Brooks expended
a little more energy than the
others.

At the end of regular match
play, Brooks was tied in every
way possible with Susan
Daniels from Hollins. In the
fence-off for the number 2 slot
from group B, Brooks struggled
to a 5-4 victory.

The fence-off finals were then
held with Jennings emerging as
the clear winner. His record for
the day (7-2). He was followed
by Wendt (6-2), Brooks (5-4),
and Garner (4-3). Brooks and
Wendt are co-captains this
season.

Other W&L fencers who
competed, but were eliminated
were Sam Harrison, Paul

Nathan, Bill Hill, Rob Earle.
Susan Daniel led the fencers
from Hollins with a 4-2 record in
regular match play. Other
participants were Rene
Lissiden, Terry Thomas, Lee
Travis, and Kim Charles.

Though not an inter-collegiate
meet, Coach Jim Worth feels
the meet provided a good
training experience for the
fencers.

“T feel our fencers have come
a long way since January. This
meet was a good measure of
exactly what we have and what
we need to work on for next
year. The trophies provided a
sort of incentive to do well. And
the girls, well...”

“T think the girls enjoyed this
meet as much as we did. They
had some fine fencers who
came very close to landing in
the fence-offs. Next year, they
will be a force to reckon with.”

Worth went on to comment on
next year’s plans:

“Right now we have twelve
regular fencers on the team. We
hope to attract more freshmen,
but 12 is an ideal number — 3
men and 1 alternate for each
weapon.”’ In fencing the
weapons are the foil, epee, and
sabre.

“We also will probably apply
for varsity status as a sport next
year. We aren’t really ready
now, but next year I feel we will
have the experience and skills
needed to compete against
other collegiate teams. I am
pleased with the interest
showed thus far and hope it will
increase next year.”’

Golfers improve record

by Bob Burkholder

The W&L golfers moved their
record up to 10-1 with a victory
over Bridgewater on Friday
and a win in a triangular match
on Monday over Bridgewater
and Roanoke.

The match last Friday
against Bridgewater was a real
cliff hanger. The Generals were
down after the front nine but
came back to get a five stroke
win at 396-401. The Generals
were led by Andy Fitzgerald
and Bo Moorehead with 77’s.
Andy turned in his second
straight medalist performance.
Bo played excellent golf on the
back nine and so was in-
strumental in the team’s second
half charge. Moorehead had not

competed for some time and so
his medalist performance was
doubly impressive. Jerry
Maatman was close behind the
leading Generals with a 78.
Sadrick (80), Leunig (84), and
Walter (84) were the other
contributors to the Generals
victory. Also, W&L was hin-
dered by the absence of number
two man, Gary Barousse, who
did not play because of illness.

On Monday at Roanoke the
Generals again came from
behind to nip Roanoke College
413-416. Bridgewater was buried
by both teams as they posted a
457. The high scores were
caused by strong, gusty winds,
Leading the Generals was Gary
Barousse. Barousse’s 78 was the

Track team ends season with win

The track and field Generals
completed their season with a
big 77-67 win over visiting
Bridgewater on Friday, and
ended with a overall mark of 5-
2, W&L’s best since 1973. The
team finished in third place in
the ODAC championships.

Friday’s win was eapecially

‘ satisfying because W&L had

finished behind the Eagles by
seven points in the ODAC meet
earlier in the year. W&L’s

dominance in the field events
proved the key to the victory.
The Generals swept the discus
with Phil Dunlay winning with a
toss of 129’10’’, followed by John
Miller and Hank Phillips.
Dunlay also won the shot put in
44’10”’.

Senior Tony Perry won the
high jump in 6’2’’, and finished
third in the triple jump. Paul
Hendry jumped 5’10”’ in the high
jump to finish behind Perry.

Rob Daniels threw the Javelin
154’6”’ to win that event, while
Norvell Scott took the long jump
in 22’2%’’.

Bobby Hoffman was first in
the triple jump at 43’73%4”’. John
Tucker won the 880 in 1:58.3,
while Jack Norberg won the 220
in 23.16. The Generals’ mile
relay team of Norberg, Scoot,
Tucker and Stu Atkinson
wrapped up the win with a time
of 3:28.6.

What’s a Nittany Lion?

(continued from page 6)
two assists. Senior defenseman
John Strock won the Cannon
Award for his all-around play.

The win over then seventh
ranked Rutgers was W&L’s
sixth in their last seven games,
and upped their most recent
winning streak to two games.
Seven third quarter goals
enabled W&L to up their road
record to 5-1. The score was tied
at 4-4 with five minutes gone in
the third period when the
Generals went on a tear and
tallied eight straight goals in a
matter of 15 minutes to lead 12-4
with ten minutes left.

Sophomore’ attackman
Johnny Black had two goals and
two assists in that span, and had
four goals goals on the af-
ternoon. Chris Kearney added
three goals, and Doug Fuge a
pair. W&L’s ‘‘Excitement
Plus,”’ junior goalie Charlie
Brown continued his top notch

play stopping 19 Scarlet Knight
shots and contributing two nifty
assists.

Three goals and two assists in
the two games by soph Jeff
Fritz made him the eighth
player in W&L history to score
over 50 points in one season.
Kearney had become the
seventh player two games ago.
Black, after five goals and three
assists this week, needs five
more points to pass the 50 mark.

The Generals are again
ranked. fifth in the USILA
University Division poll, tied
with Penn, and play Penn State
to end their regular season on
Saturday. Game time is 2:00
p.m. on Wilson Field,. The
Nittany Lions lead the series 4-
1, with the teams last having
played in 1963.

The NCAA _ University
Division playoffs open on
Wednesday, May 18th with the
nation’s top eight teams seeded
according to a vote of the NCAA
Selection Committee. Should
the Generals be seeded fifth,
they would play at the home site
of the fourth seeded team, right
now that being Navy. The
question is, will the selection
committee seed Maryland
second, Hopkins third, and
Navy fourth, making three of
the first four games in the
Baltimore area and possibly
hurting overall attendance. Or
could the Generals make it to
fourth, and host a first round
game In Lexington with a draw
of 5,000-7,000 almost guaran-
teed. The semifinals are
scheduled for May 21st, with the
championship game set for May
28th in U. Va.’s Scott Stadium.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

FAREWELL

Bill Noell’s resignation announcement this week
has made me feel this is indeed a sad occasion for the
university.

Dean Noell gave many years of his life to
Washington and Lee and I am sure he will have many
fond meories of them. As an undergrad, Noell served
the school as President of the student body. He was a
Phi Beta Kappa, ODK, and a Fulbright scholar.

His seven years on the faculty were spent as pre-
law advisor, director of financial aid, associate
Director of Admissions, associate Dean of Students,
secretary of Phi Beta Kappa, and the job he created
— coordinator of the freshman year.

As can be seen from his credits, he no doubt has
served the university in many ways. Yet, perhaps the
most important way in which he served W&L cannot
be typed up in a resume,and this is the way in which
every other student and who have had contact with
him will remember him.

I first came in contact with Dean Noell as a fresh-
man before matriculation when he delivered a speech
to my class during the Lee Chapel seminar. He talked
about the honor system, tradition, and the true
gentleman. By the end of the talk, it was evident to
everyone that the then-emotional Noell had delivered
his speech from the deepest realms of his heart. Not
only was he moved by his own speech, but every
freshman who walked out of Lee Chapel that day, felt
proud to be a student at Washington and Lee.

As far as I am concerned, Bill Noell epitomizes the
W&L gentleman standards that Robert E. Lee
described nearly a century ago. Noell is a very high-
minded and principled individual and brings that
attitude to others around him. He has a knack for
presenting the traditions and ideals of an old southern
university in modern terms to scared groups of im-
mature freshmen. Noell always leaves an individual
with the idea that he expects the best from that
person. Yet if the person fails to live up to these ex-
pectations, he will not be angry nor will he exhibit
disappointment, but only give encouraging words of
advice.

In his new job, Noell will have the opportunity to
combine the experience he gained here with his law
skills. Many new opportunities will open for him, and
for this reason, I am happy for him. I am sad for the
university, not only because everyone here will be
loosing the closeness of his friendship, but also a part
of the institution. Washington and Lee just won’t seem
to me the same without him.

LETTERS TO ED

Responses to editorial outcry

Editors:

On Friday, May 6, I was
surprised to read the editorial
by J. Michael Gallagher con-
cerning the Honor System. He
spoke of the Honor System as
being a facade, that it actually
doesn’t work and should be
abolished. Mr. Gallagher, a
man whom I thought had
common sense, included many
hard facts in his writing, but he
spoiled his work by calling for
the abolition of the System. He
offered no solution, instead he
took a very dishonorable way
out of a serious problem.

Let’s start at the beginning.
First, there allegedly have been
an unusual amount of violations
this year. Notes, exams, sports
equipment and more have
disappeared. The seriousness of
this isn’t known until one is a
victim of such a crime. As to
why these violations weren’t
reported, Gallagher wrote that
1. they weren’t important
enough, 2. nothing would come
of it or 3. the alleged offender
wouldn’t be convicted. The first
reason is easily answered by
saying that any violation, no
matter how small, is important
enough to report to the Com-
mittee. It is the second and third
reasons that start me thinking.
If it is the common opinion that
nothing will come of the
violation and the offender would
not be convicted, and this
opinion is actually the case,
then the problem rests with the
E. C. This would seem to imply
that the E. C. is ineffective and
unable to uphold the law. But I
refuse to believe this because of
the high calibre of these elected
persons sitting on the Com-
mittee. So the problem turns
again to the students.

There are people who are
committing violations and there
are those who know of violations
but never report them. There is
in effect a ‘‘coverup.” If one
talks, he could implicate
himself, or be the object of peer
pressure, so one doesn’t talk.
This all brings back memories

Editor:

As a Class Agent and former
Editor, I have been receiving
The Ring-tum Phi and just
wanted to tell you how much I
have enjoyed and appreciated
the efforts of you and your
associates.

The new format, as displayed
in the April 21st issue, is very
refreshing. I believe it offers
great possibilities. The use of
more pictures, the opportunity
for catching headlines, and a
more compact publication is the
most exciting thing that’s
happened to the publication in
many years. Hope you take full
advantage of it.

It certainly is cleaner, lends
itself to imaginative jour-
nalism. Proof-reading seems to
have improved which was long
over due. Inasmuch as_ the
publication must go to secon-
dary schools and _ other
universities, this is a golden
opportunity to create a fine
impression.

What bothers me really is the
apathy that seems to exist on
the campus. Remarks such as
“a sleepy Southern university
like W&L written by a Dee Dee
Warren — _ is __ bother
some. The behavior of fans at
lacrosse games equally an-
noying. Can’t tell you any
solution, but you probably know
most of the reasons for these
things. Any way of turning some
of these around? We were a

pretty Class School — thought

we still were — now I wonder.
Consider listing the classes
when you show staff. Might help
foster a long overdue class unity
which may be part of the
problem. Whatever, forgive my
rambling. You’ve done one
helluva fine job.
Cordially,
Donald S. Hillman ’46

Editor:
The staff of the RtP should be
complimented, perhaps

because of the new format and
leadership or both, for finally
reporting events as they ac-
tually happen. For instance,
last week the anger of several
frustrated students was
relieved. An excellent article
remembering the ‘‘Promise of
the Dope Meeting” makes one
inclined to concur with J. M.
Gallagher’s “‘realization’’ of the
joke of the Honor System. For
one, can ““W&L gentlemen’ lie?
Also, aren’t elected officials on
the Student Control Committee
responsible to their classmates
and-or the Executive Com-
mittee?

Furthermore, another issue
reported was the E. C.’s
“Hilarious actions’ for the
second consecutive week. In
question in this week’s episode
was the money appropriated for
the E. C. banquet and Mr.
Underhill’s high level of
audacity. Discussing the former
with a peer, the following
question was posed: If the E. C.
achieved something this year,
don’t they deserve a party? The
answer is undoubtedly in the
negative. The E. C. is a
voluntary committee. In-
dividuals are not forced to run
for it. Granted, the work load is
heavy, but the candidates know
that beforehand.

As a result, instead of the
petition demanding that the E.
C. not hold a banquet using
student funds, perhaps those
students signing the opposing
petition should, indeed, make a
collection for the Executive
Committee banquet. And while
they’re at it, maybe some extra
money could be collected ‘for
Mr. Underhill’s car, too!

Underhill

(continued from page 2)
Underhill feels that a change
possibly will be made in policy
concerning Lexington related
law offenses vs. W&L rleated
offenses overseen by the
Student Control Committee.

“This year’s E. C. seems to
have made a distinction be-
tween Lexington and related of-
fenses and honor violations at
W&L. Of course, as specified in
the White Book, we must follow
the opinions of the present
student generation in deter-
mining what constitutes an
honor violation. I personally
can see no distinction between
violations that occur off campus
and campus related violations.
Of course, each case must be
treated separately, but I think
the members of next year’s E.
C. feel the same way, though I
really can’t speak for them.”

All in all, Underhill wants a
stronger, stricter, and more
efficient honor system. He
believes that any honor
violation, whether it be lying,
cheating, or stealing is a
dishonorable act and should be
punished by expulsion.

‘Washington and Lee is
comprised of honorable gen-
tlemen. If we had graduated
penalties for honor violations, in
essence, we would be admitting
that dishonorable individuals
resided in our community. I
don’t believe the honor system
can exist with anything but the
maximum penalty.”

of Watergate. Senator Lowell
Weiker of Connecticut made an

important point when he said |

that while the legal system had
been breached, it also showed
that it worked, and justice was
being set down. The criminals
had been discovered by the
system, and the system was
dealing with them. There is a
relation here with the Honor
System. Although it is oc-
casionally violated, the system
is capable of working ef-
ficiently, if we all share the
responsibility.

Mr. Gallagher mentioned the
“strong influence’ the Honor
System had on on his choice of
college. It weighed heavily in
my choice also. That’s why I
have trouble understanding his
suggestion to abolish the Code,
or looking at it in a different
view, to allow dishonesty. I
would take a more optimistic
stand. Keep the System and
take new steps’ toward
educating the students and
being more stringent with
alleged violators. Abolition of

the “System would only com-

pound the problem.

Mr. Gallagher is capable of
being a good editor of the Ring
Tum Phi in the next year. I
would only hope that he use

better discretion when writing
his editorials to be read by so
many people. He must now
realize that his opinion will be
the basis of many others. If he
respects this school as he says,
he must show it in his words.
Sincerely,

The Nose knows all

And speaking of rolling in the
muc like swine, the Nose sniffed
out the fact that one of our noted
alumni who sits on the high
council known as the Board of
Trustees was doing that very
thing Thursday night at
Zollman’s while in the pursuit of
lovely young things from the
Buena Vista School for Young
Ladies and Husbandless
Homemakers. When the clock
struck twelve and they all
turned into pumpkins, he
returned to the abode of one of
our very own gentlemen
students in pursuit of liquor and
more women. Alas, he was
felled by John Barleycorn
before the night grew much
older, Oh, the exuberance of our
forgotten youth.

What is worse, Thursday
night’s revels were not enough,
and the search for pleasures of
the flesh continued on Friday.
But even a Trustee learns that,
contrary to the catalog, dates
are not easy to find during the
last three weeks of Spring
Term. Of course, he has an out,
and our subject took off for the
nation’s captial where the flesh
is caught with a lot less pursuit.

And how is this for a
descriptive phrase? ‘‘He’ll Dick
Nixon you to death by talking all
around the question.” Don’t
know who was being discussed,
but the vividness of this phrase
is such that no one can possibly
survive the post-Watergate era
without adding it to their
vocabulary.

Then there is the completely

unfounded rumour that a
certain Hollins fencer took after
one of our recently elected E. C.
officials with a bottle instead of
a foil. She missed, but the light
pole has an awfully big dent.
“I want her body” was our
editor’s comment on seeing the
picture of W&L’s own Multiple
Sclerosis pin-up girl. Just
proving that the Nose plays no
favorites. We report the dirt on
anyone and everyone. Of
course, the Nose could use some
help. Just drop your gossip
under the Phi door. In a sealed
envelope please, with your
name, so the facts can be
verified by our hard-working
news staff. All sources will be
protected as tips are burned
after reading. No letter bombs,

please.

Friday, May 13

 

 

by Joe Dubuque
What’s all the shouting fer?
Well if you didn’t notice, May 1,
Al Black Day, passed by with
only a few whimpers. May 1.

also traditionally the
celebration of the Soc-
ialists eminent vic-

tory, marks the date of spon-
taneous frivolity here at W&L.
Some say that the forgotten
observance of this hallowed
tradition marks a decline in
college life. Only the present
Generals can remedy this sad,
sad malady.

What the !Xi, 2X0 is Al
Black? Well the class of ’77 may
remember him as he was
triumphantly hailed when he
again entered Lexington in the
spring of 1974. The SAB ap-
propriated the full amount of
travel for this awesome here to
return. Even the calendar of my
catalogue showed May 1 as his
own day. It seems Al Black was
a somewhat shy, studious
Senior when somehow,
somewhere, everyone started
chanting his name. he had
never been so popular in his life,
so it seemed. Even today no one
knows why he was picked. Was
it his emerging maturity as a
revolutionary? Robert E. Lee
might have said, ‘Twas his
duty.”” To do what? To Lead!

Wherever he went, his name
was shouted with glee. The
Dining Hall especially became
a voice box. Just like a prison
with shouts to kill, the dining
hall boomed with chants for Al
Black.

Well in 1974, when he arrived
after a victorious spring the
year before, all still knew his
name. On the night of May 1, the
loyal. followers met in the
Freshman old quad. Al Black
seemed ready to launch his mob

against the institutions of

Lexington. Often, during his
speech, cries like “‘you big fish”’
or ‘‘Goose’’ were heard—
besides many obscenities. Even
a beer can was thrown from the
fourth story exuberantly at him.
Luckily he avoided disaster by
ducking his head. He convinced
all to parade down Main Street
while a few held him on their
shoulders.

Next the mob went to the
gates of VMI. The cadets,
forewarned of his assault, layed
ready with their weapons. The
crowd, number ing the hun-
dreds pressed against the
barrack gate, but officers and
many screaming’ cadets
prevented entry. After a motion
by the cadets to draw back, a
large torrent of water streamed
down, not on the mob, but on the

hardly knew ye

officers who stood there.

Then the great leader said
“To the Law School’”’ There his
carriers threw him on a table.
He called for a trip to Sweet
Briar. Shouts of ‘‘Get none”’
followed. Thereafter the en-
thusiastic Generals filling the
first floor of Tucker Hall
marched to the library, then to
the President’s House.

After minutes of loud chan-
ting and frivolous laughter, the
President emerged in his
nighttime attire. Violently the
crowd shouted for a holidday.
President Huntley’s reply was
hailed with ecstacy for a few
moments. He said yes, school
could be cancelled...‘‘until 8:00
tomorrow.”

Still, Al Black vowed to go to
Sweet Briar, but as a strong
leader, he compromised ‘‘To
Southern Seminary.’’ Shouts
were followed by cries of
“Hungry Hill.” Then began the
largest car caravan in
Lexington’s history. State
Police, and local police passed
lines of cars and “moons” all
the way to B. V. The police
barricaded the entrance with
their cars. But behold! The
Generals, using great strategy
rushed the hill in numbers after
parking! Then came down the
fire ladders, doors flew open,
and a large scale invasion of the
dorms insued. Exploding
fireworks, buckets of water
heaved from windows, and fire
extinguisher fights marked the
persence of the assault.

Now, three years later, this
seems only a memory for the
Class of ’77. Can the lack of
cheer be a reflection upon the
Class of ’78, ’79, ’80? Can this
great tradition of revolution
somehow fade in the tide of C-
School seriousness? I hope not.
Generals of W&L, Go Wild!

Near disaster on Vulcan Alcedo

(continued from page 1)
recommence at three, ending
for dinner around six. An 8:30 or
9:00 bedtime became habit
because of the rigors of living on
the Equator.

Tuesday, April 12th, broke
with the daily routine, and was
a day which signified the
beginning of an adventure the
eight members of group one will
never forget. Leaving Dr. Hick-
man on the boat, John Collums,
Rob Bates, Bob Ottenritter,
Howdy Knipp (the camel), Ed
Gerhardt, Lee Ginsburgh, Tuck
Laffitte, and Kirk Ruffin, set off
for a three-day research ex-
pedition up the Vulcan
Alcedo (3600 ft.) to look at the
Galapagos tortoises. With them
they took enough food for the
trip, two gallons of water each,
no maps, and just one compass.
The climb was made more
arduous by the 50-60 pound
packs on their backs, the
sweltering heat, and the lack of
a trail.

One and a half miles into the
trip, their guide, Gail Davis,
realized the climb would be too
difficult, so she turned back,
decided to return to the beach,
and wait for three days. Now
without a guide, the W&L
students continued their assent
of the voleanic mountain. Tuck
Laffitte recorded in his journal
that ‘our instructions were to
follow goat paths until they
crossed a ravine to the left of
the ferns.”’ Following donkey
trails up a sheer, verticle climb,
the group ran into ferns over
five feet high: ‘‘At times we
would have to fall down on the
ferns and stand up again to
progress at all. There was no
way to walk.”

Exultation swept through the
group when they reached the
top at 4:30 — after seven hours
of difficult climbing. Camp was
made at 5:30, just as a fog
started to settle in. The group
was too tired to eat much. They
bedded down for the night with
high winds pulling at their tents.

‘“‘At sunrise, we broke camp
and headed for our second camp
sight, 90 degrees around the
rim. The path varied from
2% feet wide rockwide rock
walls to turtle paths, including
breaks in the walls to get past.
Each wall took a little more
strength, but we got there by
9:30.”

The second day was spent
studying the Galapogos Tor-
toises in the caldara —
whereever they could be found.
The crater was very dry, and
the water the explorers carried
with them disappeared rather
quickly. It took nearly an hour
anda half to scale the southwest
wall of the caldara. Ed
Gerhardt found a scorpion, but
no one was anxious to go back to
see it.

An impromptu celebration
was held that night. Everyone
ate at least some dinner, and
most of the food and water was
consumed. Spirits were
high...the trip was almost over.
That dinner was the last meal
the group had for the next two
days.

Morning of the third day:
“We broke camp early and
without breakfast. We had
planned to return to the beach,
not by retracing our original
path, but,hopefully, by leaving
the rim earlier and spiraling
down the volcano in a coun-
terclockwise fashion heading to
the northeast.”’ Each of the
seven (Lee Ginsburgh, weighed
down by heavy camera
equipment, had returned to the
beach the first day) had only
one or two quarts of water. The
group followed goat and turtle
paths, thinking that they were
following the same trail Kirk
Ruffin had used two years
previous.” But the path got
worse as they went along.

“After five hours of constant
(descent), we became aware
that the ground was not drop-
ping as fast as it should have.
We were caught up in an area of
tropical plants. Until we got to a
lower elevation, the flora wasn’t
going to change, and we could
make no better than about half
a mile an hour in the brush as it
was.”’ So they trailblazed
through the dense, chest-high
ferns. The terrain had leveled
off, but the group found
themselves in a jungle with no
trail to follow. One person would
break ahead to clear a trail until
he could go no further, then
someone else would take the
trailblazing chore.

At one o’clock in the af-
ternoon, the group rested for an

hour. It was decided that the
remaining water should be
rationed. No one was allowed to
drink without the consent of all.
They were in the middle of a
jungle-like plain. Deep ravines
had prevented them from going
the desired direction, and they
were forced by the terrain to go
southeast. Returning to the
original trail was out of the
question; they were too far
away and it would be an up-hill
climb. Their only wish was to
get to the shore.

After each man had said a few
words of encouragement, the
seven set off again, this time by
compass. It was a_ slow,
exhausting struggle through the
jungle. Insects, foliage barring
their way, the intense heat
burning their skin — and no
water to cool their parched
throats or refill their body’s
depleted water reserves. They
pushed for four hours by the
needle of the compass, knowing
that the second group was
waiting for them on the beach
with food and water.

They took many rests that
afternoon. They were all weak
and thirsty. Most had not really
eaten for three days. It had all
seemed so easy the night
before. But at eight o’clock on
the evening of the third day, the
situation was getting desperate.
There was very little water and
almost no food. They tried to
hike by flashlight for half an
hour. They had a flare for
emergencies to signal the ship,
but it was too foggy to be seen.
They built a bonfire, but they
knew it could not be seen more
than 50 yards away. They were
weak and hungry and tired and
hot. Their mouths were dry.
Their throats burned from lack
of moisture. No one slept that
night. “‘We stared at the sky and
prayed for the clouds overhead
to rain.” Later in the night, the
clouds drifted away and the sky
was clear.

Dawn of the fourth day began
with a flare for help sent up in
the hope that the ship would
spot it. They started off again
with one quart of water
remaining for the seven of
them. Spirits were low and

almost everyone was resigning
himself to a fate which seemed
increasingly inevitable. The
consensus was for building a
fire and waiting for rescue. It
was already getting hot.

Tuck Laffitte climbed a tree
and spotted shore about three
hours away. From the tree, he
could also tell that the fire they
had built would not be spotted
from the ship; a large land rise
blocked the view. There was no
way they could be found. Laf-
fitte announced his intention of
leaving, much to everyone’s
dismay. After some discussion,
Laffitte left with Howdy Knipp
and half the water in search of
rescue.

Alone together, the two
cleared the heavy brush
(without packs)in an hour, and
crossed a lava field by nine. The
hot sun forced them to the
water, where they cooled off:
“It felt as good as food at the
time. But we had to move on.
We had to have food. Our water
was thick with saliva from
spitting back into it. It kept us
going.’’ They killed a sea lion
and tried to drink the blood, but
were repulsed. They continued
northward.

The five they had left behind
were under a tent flap for extra
shade. Their water was gone by
noon. They had begun saving
their urine, hoping to distill it —
possibly to drink it. The cac-
tuses and vines around them
were dry because it had not
rained for three months.

In the heat of the day, Knipp
and Laffitte rested in caves
along the coast. Their vision
was blurred for lack of food and
water. They no longer sweated
because they had nothing to
sweat anymore All they could
do was inch their way north,
and rest when they could not
continue. Laffitte writes: ‘TI
was worried about getting out in
time to help the others. I was
worried about getting out at

all.”

They spotted the boat at 2:30,
and were picked up fifteen
minutes later. In between gulps
of water, the pair directed the
captain to the island they had
used as a reference point for
locating the others. Rescue
teams were sent out to search
with water, flares, chocolate,
and flashlights.

With only minutes of daylight
left, the five were found and the
important operation of food and
water delivery was carried on
during the night. At 8:30, on the
morning of the fifth day, all of
Group One was returned to the
ship. Still shaken by the in-
cident, all seven spent the next
few days recuperating, and
trying to regain the 15-20 pounds
of weight they had each lost.

It had been a trying ex-
perience. An experience which
had forced each of them to
rethink and reevaluate many
important thoughts in their
minds. Those two days taught
all seven of.them more about
themsely@ssand others, than

any other single experiencé in™”

their lives. Of course their trip
was not over. They did not

return until the end of April. But »,

300 To Graduate
Thursday Morning

by Heartsill Ragon

For the 227th time since
W&L’s opening, graduating
seniors will make one of their
final walks down the column-
lined front campus. However,
this walk will not be a worried
rush to a test or a class but
instead, will be a leisurely stroll
to the diploma line.

W&L’s graduation
ceremonies will be _ held
Thursday May 26 at 11 a.m. on
the front campus, weather
permitting. Over 300 seniors
will be presented’ with
bachelor’s degrees while 71 law
degrees will be presented to
graduating law students.

The commencement
ceremony itself will feature
speeches by W&L President
Robert E. R. Huntley and
student body President Thomas
H. Hunter.

Preceding the formal
graduation ceremonies, retired

Army .General Bruce C. Clark
will be the principle speaker at
ceremonies honoring the
student members of the W&L
Reserve Officer Training
Corps. The commissioning of
these officers will take place in
Lee Chapel and will begin at 9
a.m.

Graduation activities for-
mally begin Wednesday when
the traditional baccalaureate
service will be conducted. The
11 a.m. ceremony will be held in
Evans Dining Hall and will be
directed by Dr. David W.
Sprunt, university chaplain and

Annual RtP Awards;
Noell, Print Shop Honored

by Robert D. Lutz

Associate Dean of Students
William A. Noell and the entire
staff of the Washington and Lee
Journalism Laboratory Press
(commonly called the ‘Print
Shop’) have been chosen as
recipients of the 1977 Ring-tum
Phi Awards for distinguished
service to the W&L University
community.

Dean Noell is leaving W&L
after seven years of service in
various administrative
positions in order to accept a
post.at the University of
Virginia. Students during those
years often came to identify
Dean Noell with W&L itself;
during those years he has
handled every conceivable sort
of student ‘‘crisis’’. And still he
seems sane. This marks the
second time in his career that
Dean Noell has_ inexplicably
transformed himself from a
W&L gentleman into a
“Wahoo.”

Collective recipients of the
second Award are:

Fontaine ‘‘Mama’’ Bostic,
business manager and general
den mother, whose lot in life
consists of administering the
various Pring Shop operations,
keeping records, ordering
supplies, dealing with various
irate administrators who never
know what’s” going. on,
and giving the Shop men
something to talk about when
she’s out of earshot.

graduating students, their
family and guests.
E. T. Walker, production

manager, who manages to
make sure that everything gets
finished more or less on time.
What’s amazing is that Ed this
without ever raising his voice or
becoming violent; if you knew
what he has to put up with,
you’d know what a feat that is.
And no matter how busy he is,
Ed somehow always finds time
to do a favor for anyone who
asks, even if it means using both
hands and both feet to run four
machines at once.

Don Tabbut, offset press
operator and master of the
Shop’s finest piece of equip-
ment, the Heildelberg press.
Don is a mellowing influence in
a shop full of volatile crazies,
dangerous only when he’s
dealing the cards.

Hunter McCoy, typesetter
and professional sourpuss.
Beneath that cynical, abrasive,
and sometimes nasty exterior
there lies a heart of gold. The
only problem is finding it.

‘‘Light-fingers’’ Larry
Mason, linocomp operator. If he
ever takes a swing at you,
you’re probably dead. Chances
are it won’t happen, though;
he’ll bend over backwards to
help you. The only thing Larry’s
likely to destroy in the near
future is that damned linocomp.

Backus’ shoes calls for courage
and craftmanship of the highest

crystal-clear day that sun
bathers love. A slight breeze, a
few clouds and a hot, bright sun
completed all the ingredients
for a picnic with your girlfriend.
But for 39 contestants in the
First Annual Ring-tum Phi
Road Race, that sun was to
become a dreaded enemy.

Although several more had
registered for the race, only 39

Freshmen

To Number
350

Washington and Lee will have
an entering freshman class of
about 350 students, according to
admissions director James D.
Farrar.

That is back to what
university officials consider the
optimum entering freshman
class size after this year’s 402
freshmen.

Farrar said last year’s class
was the result of an un-
precendented yield in the ad-
missions process.

Better than 50 per cent of the
791 high school students offered
admission for the 1976-77
academic year _ accepted
positions in the freshman class.
There were 1,298 applicants.

This year, the admissions

grueling 15-mile event. Fred
Schwab, professor of geology
and a veteran of the Boston
Marathon, won the race in a
time of 1 hr: 45 min: 45 sec.
Freshman Brian Adams was
second with a timing of 1 hr:50
min:48 sec. and Chris Haynes
came in third clocking at 1 hr:
52 min: .04 sec. All three run-
ners were awarded a trophy in
addition to the T-shirt that
every contestant received.

President Robert Huntley
was the official starter of the
race that began at the County
Courthouse on Main Street in
Lexington. From there the
runners traveled along Rt. 11
until turning towards Bean’s

Bottom to the first refreshment
stand. After a series of long
climbs on dusty roads, the
halfway point and another
refreshment point were
reached. The twisting route
then back-tracked and went
behind the campus of V.M.I. up
to the finish lap at Wilson Field.
The expressions on the runner’s
faces at the last checkpoint and
the finish line tell a story in
themselves.

Mike Gallagher, the inventor
and organizer of the mini-
marathon event, had com-
mented before the race that
most of the runners competed
as a matter of pride and not
necessarily to win. Some of that

Land Fraud In Va.

The three reporters quizzed
the lawyer for two hours about
certain associates of his, and
their business activities. He
gave them the information they
desired, but not overly
willingly.

They had come in playing
dumb, acting like they didn’t
know much about what they
were asking. But as the con-
versation progressed, it became
apparent to the lawyer he had
underestimated them. For

every answer he gave, the
reporters came back with
another question. ‘‘Well, wasn’t
it really like this...’”’ ‘We heard
from someone else it happened
this way...”

Slowly but surely the
threesome exhausted every
loose end they could think of,
except one. They were saving
that for last, because they knew
asking about it could suddenly
end the interview.

Then, finally, with no place
left to go, they struck home and
asked the lawyer about himself.
The mood of the interview
changed drastically. The
lawyer took his feet down off his
desk and sat forward in his
chair. He tore off a small piece
of paper and started chewing on
it. He handled the questions
about his suspension from the
bar 19 years. before with
guarded caution. When the
subject shifted to his 11-year
hiatus in Florida, he became
even more nervous and started
doodling on the pad before him.

department has accepted 30
fewer students. Of the 1,320
applicants this year 762 have
been accepted Farrar said.

Of those accepted, Farrar
expects approximately 47 to 48
per cent to enter the class.

At this point, 357 students
have confirmed their ac-
ceptance. Twenty-five of these
were early decision students
and five are students who
deferred admission from last
year.

This year’s class is expected
to be of a higher academic
quality than some in the past,
Farrar added.

“SAT’s are up, and for the
first time W&L was able to offer
honor scholarships” he said.

That enables W&L to attract
better students who might have
gone somewhere else because
they would receive a_ better
financial deal, he said.

The university offers Robert
E. Lee scholarships, which are
a total grant, National Merit
scholarships, which pay the
student a _ fixed sum,
Washington Honor scholar-
ships, which are offered to in-
state students and Gaines
Honor scholarships, which go to
out-of-state students.

W&L offered these honor
awards to 59 incoming fresh-
men. Twenty-eight of those
students will come to W&L next
fall.

Of the students offered the
grants, those refusing are going
to attend schools with which
W&L has long felt in com-
petition. Four students will go to
Dartmouth, three to Harvard
and Davidson, and one to Yale
and Princeton. Six will go to the
University of Virginia.

Dewing, Ruscio

To Stay At School

by Rex Nyquist

Douglass Dewing, a senior
from Portsmouth, Virginia, has
been named to a newly-created
position, assistant director of
publications at Washington and
Lee. Dewing, who will receive
his B. A. degree in journalism
next week, will assist R. T.
Weatherman, director of
publications, and will work
closely with the news operation.

He will inaugurate a program
under which a new graduate
will be appointed to work for
one year in the university’s
publications program. The
program is modeled after one in
the admissions office which has
been in successful operation for
eight years.

Dewing has worked as a
student assistant in the news
office for two years, and has
written occasional articles for
the alumni magazine. In ad-
dition, he has served as a
reporter for the Ring-tum Phi
and has worked at WLUR.

Also, Ken Ruscio has been
rehired as Assistant Director of
Admissions and Assistant Dean
of Students. Ruscio travels
extensively to represent the
university at secondary schools,
interviews applicants, and
assists in the Admissions and
Dean of Students offices. He has
also worked actively with the
Student Recruitment Com-
mittee this year. A_ 1976
graduate of W&L, he will serve
in his post until June, 1978.

Survey Reveals

Dope Smoking Habits

Fifty-four per cent of the
freshman class have tried
marijuana or are currently
using it, according to a survey
of 65 per cent of the class con-
ducted by Mike Mrlik. Forty-six
per cent of the class have never
tried the drug.

Mrlik’s survey was given out
to all 387 freshmen. Two hun-
dred and fifty three freshmen
responded to the survey. Mrlik
broke down the statistics fur-
ther to indicate the difference
between fraternity and in-
dependent users, the
relationship between GPA and
frequency of use and the
relationship between use of
marijuana and attitudes toward
the drug.

Mrlik found that 64.7 per cent
of fraternity members have
tried marijuana versus only
about 47 per cent for in-
dependents. Only 59 out of 167
fraternity members have never
tried marijuana, according to
Mrlik’s survey. Out of the 72
independents answering the
survey 34 said they had tried the
drug.

In relating frequency of
marijuana use to GPA. Mrlik
found that students between 1.0
and 2.0 are the most likely to be
regular and occasional users.
Seventy-two per cent of these
students are occasional users.
Freshmen between 0.0 and 1.0
were the second-most likely to
use the drug. Of the three
student listing themselves in
this ignominious category, two
listed themselves as occasional
users. Students with GPAs
between 2.0 and 3.0 were the
next most likely to use
marijuana. Forty-four per cent
of these students are either
regular or occasional users,
according to the survey. The
studious 3.0 to 4.0 students are
the least likely to use
marijuana. Only 40 per cent use
the drug, according to the
study.

The survey also found that
only 12.2 per cent of marijuana
users believe marijuna leads to
harder drugs, while 45.2 per
cent of non-users believe
marijuana leads to other drugs.

Land Fraud Uncovered

you work for?’’ He reeled off the
names of three companies.
“Okay, now let’s go back to
where you lived for just a
moment. Could you give us, say,
a specific address?”’ This was
the crucial question. The
reporters had tried to locate a
record of his residence in the
Orlando area, but had turned up
nothing. If he’d actually been
there and had been clean, they
reasoned, he’d have no ob-
jection to answering the
question.

Three...two...one...explosion!
Suddenly the lawyer was on his
feet, ranting and raving about a
“smear,” threatening to sue the
three if they ever put his name
in print, and screaming for
them to get out at once!

The incident took place in the
southwestern Virginia city of
Abingdon, the lawyer’s name
was William P. Sheffield, and
the three reporters were Gary
Collier, Neal Cory and Brad
Elliott, students in Prof. Clark
Mollenhoff’s Advanced In-
vestigative Reporting class
(Journalism 387).

Seventeen juniors and seniors
are enrolled in ‘‘Super Snoop
and Scoop,” as the course has
been called. From Mollenhoff, a
1958 Pulitzer Prize winner
acknowledged as one of the
country‘s best investigative
reporters, they have been
learning the “tricks of the
trade’ — how to dig through
obscure public records to find
information, how to get a
reluctant source to talk, what to
look for and where to look for it.

What is more fortunate is that
the class has had the op-
portunity to actually practice
what they’ve been taught.

During the winter, Mollenhoff
talked to local Commonwealth’s
Attorney John Read in hopes of
designing a suitable project for
the class to tackle. Read put
them onto what appeared at
that time to be a possible land

fraud case in Rockbridge
County. It involved three
principals-entrepreneur Robert
E. Bales of Glade Springs,
realtor Hugh Rakes of Salem,
an J. Edwin Berry of Staunton.

The class was divided into
teams to research different
facets of the case. One team, led
by Collier, was given the job of
running down Bales’
background. That team in-
cluded Elliott, Cory, Rick
Lovegrove, and Doug Jackson.
Steve Dibaggio, John Kingston
and Ed Hancock investigated
Hugh Rakes. Bill Edmisten,
Frank Turner, Bob Rathbun
and Heartsill Ragon tackled J.
Edwin Berry. Handling the
situation in Rockbridge County
were Mike Ferrara, Bill
Thompson, Chris Larson, Ed
Burgess and Galen Trussell.
Jay Taylor researched data at
the State Corporation Com-
mission office in Richmond.
Rob DiSilvestre was charged
with supervising the con-
struction of the final articles.

E. C. Finds Itself
Short Of Funds

In what Paul Larkin
described as a ‘‘very low key
meeting,’’ the Executive
Committee wound up the school
year Monday by trying to
balance the books.

Sandy Stradtman, E. C. vice
president, announced that the
E. C. is $2,200 short of projected
funds. The major reason for this
has been “attrition,” Stradt-
man said. A lot of people have
left school.

The student body fund was
originally supposed to be $68,00
for 1,700 persons, Stradtman
said. The money comes from
the student activity fee of $20
per student every semester
except the Spring Semester.
Stradtman said the deficit
might have to be made up by
using the Student Body Reserve
Fund money. However there is
still $3,200 in accounts
receivable that should be
coming in. But $2,100 of that
money is money loaned to the
Student Activities Board, and
only about half of that money is
expected back.

Right now there is about
$4,800 left in the Student Body
Reserve Fund, Stradtman said,
but there is at least $1,100 in
accounts receivable. The
reserve fund started the year
with about $6,700, said Stradt-
man, meaning at worst the fund
will have lost about $800 over
the year. The reserve fund is
used for bailing out
organizations that get into
monetary difficulties.

Members of the committee
said they expect $300 back from
the Cold Check Committee, plus
some of the $700 that they gave
to Ariel. The SAB and the Ring-

tum Phi were also mentioned as
possible sources of returned
funds. It appears that the new
E. C. will have to take care of
the monetary problems,
because some organizations,
such as the SAB, will not know
their financial situation until
sometime in the summer.

While Stradtman was closing
the books on this year’s E. C.
monetarily, Radar Davis closed
the books on the E. C.’s
legislative year. He announced
that no amendments to the
constitution passed this year
because all fell about 150 votes
short of the requirement that
for an amendment to pass at
least 50 per cent of the student
body must vote. Some amend-
ments received the required
two-thirds majority but none
received the required 800 votes,
said Davis.

In other action, the E. C.
voted 6-2 to provide the Ring-
tum Phi with honor violation
statistics. The E. C. also an-
nounced that the Mock Con-
vention has made out its final
report and had sent a copy to
the Sumner Foundation, an
organization which last year
contributed about $20,000 to the
Mock Convention. Jim McNider
and Dave Myer, the new MW. C.
co-chairmen, are hoping for
continued support from the
Foundation.

NOTICE
Eight private honor trials
were conducted by the
Executive Committee this year,
resulting in 3 convictions. Two
sophomores and one junior
were expelled from school.

Salesman Cast Effective

 

A RING-TUM PHI
INTERVIEW

 

 

by Robert B. Ramirez

Death of a Salesman is a play
that makes you unsure of
whether you’re proud or
ashamed that you’re an
American — whether you’re
glad or resentful: of the fact.
From the beginning of the play,
from the moment the Salesman
trudges wearily into his house,
sets down his bags, sighs, and
looks around him, we become
aware that something
paradoxical is about to take
place: it will be an event both

familiar and uncommon,
Shatteringly said yet full of
ultimate solace. In the

Troubadour production of the
play, this mood is announced by
the exhausted look on the face of
Warren Mowry, playing the
Salesman, and by the sad,
tender music composed by June
Morgan. The moment turned
out to be a simple, human one,
and promised many more later.

John Hollinger’s thesis
production of Death of a
Salesman is a tightly-directed
piece of ensemble acting. It did
seem to be the case, however,
that the cast was suffering from

KNOWS

Have we got real hard-core
investigative news for you
today. It has come to our at-
tention that there are some
members of the Executive
Committee who voted against
using student funds to throw
their year-end bash, but who did
so because it looked good and
they knew it would lose.

Senior rep Paul Larkin is the
one culprit who seems to be
most guilty of this. In fact, he
had done it before. At Fancy
Dress, Larkin argued long and
hard for the SAB party, to

under-rehearsal. This is a
common offense of college

productions, especially un-

derstandable in light of the
demands on the members of the
Total Theatre company. It took
a whole act for the cast to catch
the spirit of the show, to get
away from the attitude that it
was something to be gotten
through, to relax into the script
and see that it was a place to
just be. Especially in the first
act, the pace speeded up and
slowed down again, bouncing
between extremes, trying to
find its proper level. Salesman
is a script to be savored and
tasted a bit at a time, not to be
rushed through. It’s one of the
tightest, most thoughtful pieces
of writing on the market; every
line means so much; there’s no
fat or repetitiveness. Since this
is the case, the energy level
should be high but not rushed. It
should take place at the pace of
the normal American speech of
normal Americans who are not
at all sure about themselves or
the world in which they’re
trying to make their way.

In a sense, making one’s way
is a preoccupation of this play.
Willy Loman, who thinks no
career could be more satisfying
or attractive than selling, was
played by Mowry as a confused,

angry salesman, a_ per-
sonification of, the con-
tradiction and waste and half-
baked-ness that are a part of
our lives. Betty Kahn was
Linda: suffering, patient,
careworn, resigned. In her last
appearance on the Boilerroom
stage, she was Sonia in Uncle
Vanya — in many ways the
same character. It’s a pity we
didn’t see her in other shows
this year, to see whether or not
that is the only part she does
well. Listening to that mourn-
ful, almost plaintive voice,
down in the Old Boilerroom
theatre, I did find myself with a
bad case of theatrical deja vu.

Perhaps the best job of
casting I’ve seen in a long time
was Ty York and Rich Allen as
Biff and Happy. Both these men
looked perfect for their parts,
and performed better than
many far more experienced
actors I’ve seen, here and
elsewhere. One disappointment
was that Mr. Allen did have a
habit of speaking his lines more
from rote than from sympathy.
Sometimes this worked, giving
the impression of happy-go-
lucky (no pun intended) non-
chalance, but at other times it
ended up merely spoiling the
fascinating attractiveness of
what was being said.

INTERVIEW

 

 

by Jay W. McCann

Neil Simon is a lightweight.
He grinds out plays the way
craftsmen, in a better time,
made furniture: carefully
fitted, lovingly constructed, but
lacking the profundity or
monumentality of high art. I
know we mustn’t expect Simon
to be Shakespeare or even
Stoppard. We can, however,
expect him to be witty instead of
cute, and insightful instead of
banal.

Unfortunately he is, in both
cases, more often the latter.
Comedies of the British type
and tradition are really to be
preferred. Simon doesn’t have a
play that can match Hadrian
VII, The Jockey Club Stakes, or
Private Lives, all of which are
clever plays, dealing with in-
teresting people.

Now that my prejudice is
revealed, I can proceed to deal
with specifics, namely the
University Theatre production
of Barefoot in the Park, which
happens to be one of Simon’s
better attempts, along with The
Sunshine Boys, which many
critics consider his finest to
date. In fact, Bobby Carpentier
(whose Senior Drama Thesis
this is) tells us in the playbill
notes that Noel Coward
recommended Barefoot to
aspiring playwrights as a model

ssetcetaen

The action involves two
couples. The first is a young
attorney, and his frenetic and
silly wife of six days. The
second is the wife’s widowed
mother, and the young couple’s
new and eccentric neighbor,
Mr. Velasco. The young
couple’s adjustments to
brownstone living on 48th St.,
and to married life, are played
off the older couple’s already
ingrained foibles. Certainly the
comic potential is there.

And it is, by and _ large,
realized in this prodiction. Paul
Morella, as the young attorney,
did come off a bit stiff at the
beginning, but came alive with
the argument scene of Act II,
finally delivering the comic
coup-de-grace with the drunk,
out of the window action at the
close of the play.

The mother-in-law was
played by Rose Gordon, who
also hit her stride in Act II, after
the return from the Albanian
restaurant. Her performance in
the final act, in bathrobe and
slippers, came off very well
indeed.

Mr. Velasco is one of Simon’s
more successful characters,
and perhaps his most hilarity-
provoking. The flamboyant
Velasco was played to the hilt
by the exuberant John Ellis.
Along with Morella, this will be
Ellis’ last scheduled per-
formance in a show for the
University Theatre, and it

(continued on page 7)

Although the four major roles
were well cast and handled,
there were disappointments in
some of the smaller parts. Hub
Kennedy as Ben came on far too
strongly to suit me, and I just
can’t forgive him for spoiling
the mood after the climactic
scene in Act II. At the other end
of the spectrum from
Kennedy’s gangbusters
exuberance was Chip Brown as
Howard. Trying to look bored,
he succeeded only in boring. If
he did care about what he was
doing on stage, (and he was
trying to look interesting),
there was no hint of it in his
listless, unanimated voice.

Voice, in fact, was the major
downfall of the show. I wish Mr.
Hollinger had shown his cast a
half-dozen movies from the late
1940’s. His cast needed more
familiarity with the natural
cadences of American
colloquial speech. But, the
speech problem could have
been the result of self-
consciousness; in the second
act, once the cast had settled
themselves into what they were
doing, the artificiality in the

THE RING-TUM PHI 3
language disappeared.

The ensemble playing of the
four principals in the “Did you
plant?”’ scene is what the play is
all about. When it was over,
acting in my role as critic-
reviewer, the only note I could
take was a delighted, humble,
moved observation that the
scene had worked. In the end,
the whole play worked, because
the actors truly understood
where they were and what was
going on. There was _ in-
telligence, thought, and sym-
pathy, even in some of the
minor roles.

Ginger McNeese showed a lot
of spunk and humor as The
Woman, along with Phyllis
Davis and June Morgan, as
Letta and Miss Forsythe. By the
time these three had done their
bits, we had learned what the
myth of the American Bitch
Goddess is all about. Art Bloom
(Stanley) played his small role
with sensitivity, achieving
perhaps the greatest measure
of humanity and simple dignity.
And then there was Paul Cella
as Charley...perfect. He’s the

Golfers Drive For

National Showing

by Bob Burkholder

The W&L golf team got the
long anticipated invitation to
the Division III National Title
Tournament to be held at
Kenyon College in Gambier,
Ohio on May 24th thru the 27th.
The Generals will be compe"’ <
against twenty teams, vu
which is league foe Lynch. | ¢
College. The four day tour-
nament will consist of 72 holes
of golf. The four top scores of
each day’s action will count
towards the team’s score. The
Generals will be allowed to send
five golfers. It appears that they
will be Jerry Maatman, Gerry
Barousse, Dave Leunig, Terry
Shadrick, and Andy Fitzgerald.

Here is a short run down on
these five players: Jerry
Maatman has been number one
man for the Generals all season.
Jerry has also been captain of
the team for the past two
seasons. Maatman led the team
with a season average of 76
strokes per 18 holes. According
to Coach Leslie, Maatman
exhibits an excellent attitude
and leads by example. Jerry
was All-Conference this season.
Number two man for the year is
Gerry Barousse. Barousse
averaged 78 this season and
made All-Conference. Coach
Leslie praises Gerry’s con-
sistent play throughout the
season. ”

Playing number three man
will be Dave Leunig. Dave
averaged 79 this year. Leunig
was the ODAC Player-of-the-

1977 golfers:

Ist row, left to right:

Year and All-Conference. Dave
is a real streak shooter and
when his game is right he can
play with anyone. Coach Leslie
feels Dave’s competitiveness is
his best attribute. Fourth man
will be Terry Shadrick. Terry
had a season average of 78.5 and

also named All-Conference
th season. Consistency was
tue attribute that Coach Leslie
used to describe Terry’s play.
Andy Fitzgerald will be playing
number five man. Andy’s
season average was 79.5. After
a slow start, Andy came on
strong and was a key player in
the stretch run of a 10-1 season.
Leslie described Andy as a very
good competitor. Players who
will not be making the trip to
Gambier but made _ con-
tributions to the team’s success
are Bo Moorehead and Jim
Walter. Moorhead made key
contributions in the Generals
final two victories and Walter
was important in the team’s
early success.

Coach Leslie stresses the fact
that the tournament is a reward
for an excellent season but
quickly adds that it would be
great to win the tournament.
The chances of a high finish are
certainly within the realm of
possibility. The team has been
very consistent over the season
and this will be a definite asset
in the Nationals. The feeling of
the team is that an average
score in the 70s will be good
enough to put the Generals in
contention for the National

Title.

Generals Lose To Maryland

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team finished the
season yesterday, with a dismal
performance, losing to the
University of Maryland
Terrapins 14-8 in the first round
of the NCAA playoffs. The

Kearney scores one of six.

Terps led by as many as eight
goals with twelve minutes to
play in the third quarter. The
Generals managed a five goal
rally in the third and early in
the fourth quarters to cut

Maryland’s lead to three goals,

Generals Dump
Nittany Lions

by Steve Smith

The 1977 lacrosse team
finished the regular season
defeating Penn State 22-14,
wrapping up the most
demanding schedule in the
University’s history. The
Generals end the regular season
with a 10-3 record, ranking them
sixth in the USILA University
Division poll. This will be the
sixth consecutive year W&L
stickmen have gone to the
national tournament.

Once again the outcome of the
game was in doubt until the
third quarter when the Generals
added nine more goals to their
half-time lead of 9-8. Chris
Kearney fired in six goals and
co-captain Jack Dudley added
three more in the win. Chris
Larson and Doug Fuge each had
a pair. Junior goalie Charlie

Brown stopped 13 Nittany Lion
shots and freshman face-off
specialist Bob Clements donned
his more familiar goalie stick
for part -of the second half,
saving 7 shots.

Sophomore’ _ attackman
Johnny Black had five goals and
four assists to make him the
ninth player in W&L history to
score over 50 points in one

season. With both Kearney and
Jeff Fritz having acheived this
earlier this month, the ’77 all-
sophomore attack have tallied
over 150 points this season.
Black also won the Cannon
Award for his all-around play
against Penn State.

The senior stickmen were
honored before the game, this
being their final regular season
game and their last home game
as a W&L lacrosse player.
At an informal awards
ceremony held Sunday evening,
senior co-captain Tom Keigler
was awarded this year’s Most
Valuable Player on the team.
Johnny Black received the Most
Improved Player award. Rising
seniors, Jay Sindler and Charlie
Brown were voted next year’s
co-captains.

As the ’77 Generals go to the
national tournament, they hope
for their first national crown.
They are paired in the first
round with Maryland and if they
can win at College Park, they
would go on to play the winner
of the Hopkins - North Carolina
game, May 21. The cham-
pionship finals will be played
May 28 at UVa.

 

but the Terrapins exploded with
a four goal knockout punch to
kill W&L’s chances for ad-
vancing in the tournament.

W&L avoided a shutout in the
first half on the merits of at-
tackman Doug Fuge’s shooting.
His first goal came with 2:15
remaining in the first quarter
on a feed from Johnny Black
during an extra-man situation.
Fuge, scoring on a rebound shot
with 2:40 left in the first half,
cut Maryland’s lead to four
goals. At the end of the first
half, the score stood, Maryland
6, W&L 2. These goals by W&L
represented the only semblance
of an attack. There seemed to
be a lack of confidence on the
part of the attack, particularly
in executing the offense on the
inside. The W&L middies were
completely dominated by their
Maryland counterparts, who
scored all six of the Terps’ first
half goals.

The second half started out
worse than the first. Maryland
scored eighteen seconds into the
third quarter to make it 7-2.
Less than a half a minute later,
the Terps scored again. The
third goal came with 12:40 left
in the third quarter. This was
the telling goal for Charlie
Brown. The unalert Brown was
yanked in favor of Bill Clements
for the rest of the game.

With half of the third quarter
still to play, the Generals began
to look like the team that had
given Maryland a run for its
money earlier in the season.
W&L scored five unanswered
goals to pull to within three
goals of tying the game. The
first of this barrage came from
attackman Jeff Fritz at 8:07 in
the third period. Then middie
Jay Sindler scored two
unassisted goals to cut the lead
to five. Soon after, Jack Dudley
scored off of a ground ball
pickup with 3:35 to play in the
third quarter. Early in the
fourth quarter, the lethargic
attackman Chris Kearney
finally got on track, and put in
his first goal of the day.

But Maryland refused to
buckle, and instead rolled off
four straight goals to put the
game out of reach. Kearney
scored the last goal of the game
at 10:54, making him this
season’s leading scorer with 66
points. Unfortunately the stick-
men were unable to shut down
Maryland’s offense, which had
65 shots, nor were they able to
penetrate the Terps’ tight
defense.

Pika Wins I-M Title

Second In Two Years

by Mickey Knapp
This year’s intramural
program was completed this
week. Three new champions
emerged. The Grandstanders
dominated in winning the track
meet, Law 2 & 3 won the softball

playoff tournament, and
Lambda Chi won it all in
volleyball.

In last week’s I-M track meet
the Grandstanders won easily
outscoring runner-up Phi Psi by
over thirty points. Individual

winners for the Grandstanders
included Jim Berlin in the
discus and javelin, Chris
Kearney in the high jump, and
Bruce Howard in the pole vault.
Charlie Brown took time off
from lacrosse practice to win
the mile run. First place
finishers for Phi Psi were Ed
Johnson in the 220 and Chip
Childs in the triple jump.

In Monday night’s softball
final Law 2 & 3 beat the
Grandstanders by a score of 5-3.

Law exploded for their five runs
in the first inning and then held
off the Grandstanders with
some outstanding fielding for
the winning margin. In the
volleyball final Lambda Chi
took Law I in two straight
games for the championship. In
the evening’s semi-final they
edged out a towering Phi Psi
team in three tough games.
Pika emerged as the years
overall points champions. They

Tennis Season Winds Down

Generals To Nationals

Next Year Looks Good

by Jim Barnes

The W&L netman finished a
highly successful tennis season,
defeating Emory and Henry 8-1
last Saturday, posting a 15-13
record overall. Unfortunately
the Generals were dumped by
the Naval Academy by the
same score last Thursday at
Annapolis. The only victory
came from Stewart Jackson
defeating his opponent 6-2, 6-2.
Under different circumstances
a 15-13 record might not seem
like much of an _e ac-
complishment, but this year it
is. One only needs to look at the
extremely difficult schedule the
Generals played this year. It
was filled with strong Division I
teams, such as Rollins, the
Naval the Naval Academy, and
the University of Florida, to
name a few. To compound the
problem, four of the starting six
players, (2) Stewart Jackson,
(4) Dee Keesler, (5) Richard
Makepeace, (6) David Constine,
were freshmen.

How much the schedule
helped the Generals’ freshmen
really won’t be known until the
conclusion of the nationals. But
at least this year’s opponents
have given six freshmen tough
match experience, winning and
losing, for next year’s season
that will start in the fall. A sign
that W&L’s team has gained
respectability is the willingness
of the Universities of Maryland,
Virginia, and Ohio to compete in
the W&L Fall tournament.

A particularly solid per-
formance this year was turned
in by Stewart Jackson. Jackson
hasn’t lost a match in twenty
outings since the early April
trip to Florida, and would be the
logical choice for the most
valuable player of this year’s
tennis team. Junior Ben Johns
also played well this season.
Every match he’s played, in-
cluding the defeats, he’s given
100 per cent hustle, and lost
many close matches in a tight
third set. The only player who
won’t be returning next year is
Senior Captain Ken Voekler.
The loss of this tough com-
petitor will be particularly felt
in the more inestimable sector
of leadership. The success of the
freshmen is a reflection of the

assistance and encouragement
he has given to them. Keesler,
Makepeace, and Constine, who
started of the season a little
shaky, have contributed more
wins in the last half of the
season. They exceptionally well
during the ODAC the tour-
nament and on the Washington
D.C. road trip. The team is also
lucky to have two fine freshmen
players, Pat Norris and Don
Shuford, at the number seven
and eight positions. Both have
played well at the number two
and three doubles spot during
the regular season.

Coach Dennis Bussard, ODAC
coach-of-the-year, is very
pleased with the team. He
remembers this year’s early
season match with Swarth-
more, the top ranked team in
Division III. At that time he
commented on the many
seniors on Swarthmore’s team,
and conjected that W&L’s
tennis team might be in Swarth-
more’s place in 1980. After this
year’s performance, there’s not
unfounded optimism for moving
that date up to 1979, or 1978. A
lot will depend on how Ben
Johns, Stewart Jackson, and
Dee Keesler do at the Division
III nations this week at Millsaps
College in Jackson, Mississippi.
Here the Generals have a
chance to gain some national
recognition. The tournament
runs from the 18th to the 22nd,
and is comprised of the best
players in Division ITI.

The team will be practicing in
the fall next year, not only for
the W&L tournament, but also
for the upcoming season.
Barring any significant un-
foreseen changes in the lineup,
next year the team should be
able to post a twenty game
winning season. It will only take
a reversal of the scores of a few
individual performances in
those close 4-5 and 3-6 losses in
team matches. Coach Bussard’s
optimism for next year’s team
is well founded.

there was a heated contest for’ |”

first place throughout the race
among the top four finishers
(Mike Burns, a senior member
of the track and cross-country
teams, placed fourth.)

Brian Adams and Mike Burns
came out of the starting block in
a virtual tie for first place that
did not break until the first
refreshment point at Bean’s
Bottom. It was there that
Adams took first with Burns
falling to second. Not far behind
was Schwab and Haynes.
Adams held onto the lead
throughout most of the race
until Schwab’s running ex-
perience overcame him. Then
Adams beat off a challenge
from Haynes for second place
with. a strong finish. Burns
came in fourth after some
severe leg cramps slowed him
down.

Other finishers in order of
their place were as follows:
Paul Morella, Grant Leister,
David Daynard, Dennis Hinkle,
Harry Shaw, Rick Fink,
Marshall Snyder, Robert An-

The race went smoothly with
all of the checkpoints being
manned by a sufficient number
of people and the Rescue Squad
flanking the entire route.
Despite some comments about
the length of the race (too long)
and the refreshment points (not
enough), the majority of the
contestants and organizers
were pleased.

Gallagher commented after
the race that, ‘“‘I was pleased

turnout was not as good as
expected, Gallagher said he
was happy with the large
number of W&L runners that
showed up (33 out of 39 con-
testants were from W&L). He
further poointed out that the
proceeds of over $100 will be
donated to the local MS fund
and that an account has been
opened for the Second Annual

might be held next fall.

really delighted that they
decided to donate the proceeds
to MS.” He pointed out that at a
regional meeting for MS in
Staunton, the regional officials
“‘were thrilled” about the event.
So when the race was over, all
of the runners (tired as they
were) took advantage of that
sun and had their picnic. Happy
and content with their ac-
complishment, the dreaded
enemy was once again the
friendly sun.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK |LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

Easy Way Out?

Last week, the Ring-tum Phi ran a story entitled,
‘Graduate Summa without trying.’’ In essence, the
story revealed W&L’s gut courses. Thursday evening
at dinner — just two hours after the paper reached the
news stands — I couldn’t believe my eyes and ears;
everywhere I looked I could hear people gathered in
small groups griping and complaining about the
article. Comments ranging from, ‘‘Let’s shoot the guy
that wrote this story” to “Impeach the editor’’ could
be heard from these groups of disgruntled in-
dividuals.

Now I don’t want to offer any judgments about that
article or those individuals; I am only an observer.

However, there seems to be an undue amount of
jealousy and greed floating around our campus. W&L
students — long known for a tradition of honorly acts
and gentlemanly appearances — seem to have
deviated away from these ideals.

Judging from the comments I heard, a stranger
might have thought the Ring-tum Phi had just leveled
the structure of the curriculum at Washington and
Lee. It seemed like most of the students I heard, felt
cheated because the professor of an easy course
might have read that article and changed the make-
up of his course, making it harder.

Let me remind you, majoring in easy courses does
not make up an education. Every one of you has
chosen to come to college to get an education, yet
after hearing these fatalistic remarks about the
possibilities of losing the opportunity to receive an
“easy A’’ from a gut course, I really wonder if the
students of W&L are more concerned with cutting the
corners and getting easy grades or getting a good
education.

Some of these so called guts are easy because they
have faults in their structure. If that article in the
slightest way improved the nature of those courses,
then I believe the RtP has done a service to the school.
Remember, you have chosen to spend several
thousand dollars a year to come to a “‘good”’ school.
By rule, “‘a good school”’ usually is challenging. If you
want gut courses, then save your money and transfer
to a state school.

Editor:

Your editorial was certainly a
shock. The honor system can
and should be saved. Many
students today might be pleased
if it were to phase out. However,
later in life they will have
regrets.

What is the difference bet-
ween cheating and stealing?

If I may speak for the alumni,
you are certainly in the position
to do much for retaining and
rebuilding faith in it.

The alumni will always

cherish the honor system, -

students speaking and campus
dress.

Being a Class Agent I visit on
campus frequently. The dress is
far from being what it was but it
is still better than most cam-
puses. The students have
become careless in speaking.

Participation in a_ college
education is taken for granted
in the USA today. We were in
Russia in October; and a high
school education is compulsory
but there is only space for one
out of every twelve high school
graduates in college.

Earl T. Jones, ’30
(This note was attached to a
letter addressed to Bill Wash-
burn.)
Dear Bill:

This is the day of expectations
and ‘non-surprises’.
What do you expect the reaction
of the alumni to be upon reading
the editorial ‘A REALIZATION’
in the Friday, May 6th edition of
The Ring-tum Phi?

It has been a great feeling
being an alumnus of W&L; and I
boasted to friends, upon reading
an editorial in the local paper
concerning in excess of 90 per
cent of high school students
admitting that they cheated on
exams. When I would tell people
that the honor system at W&L
was still as effective as it had
always been I received stares.

Is it a disgrace to be

honorable today? Was J.
Michael Gallagher, Managing
Editor of THE RING-TUM PHI
writing about something that he
knew nothing about in the
editorial ‘A REALIZATION’?

Here is one short paragraph
from that editorial ‘‘Does the
faculty actually care or worry
about it? It doesn’t seem so. The
E.C. held an open house about
the honor system, and invited
the faculty. NOT ONE
SHOWED UP. (‘caps’ mine)”
No school system is effective
without faculty support.

Bill, the effect of the honor
system at W&L has been a great
influence on me. I have always
attributed the training received
from my parents and the en-
dorsement of that training at
W&L as the basic reason that I
have never had a decision to
make when it comes to ethics or
fair treatment.

I want you to explain to me
the meaning of the term ‘in-
dependent exams’ as referred
to in the editorial. Perhaps
something to do with the
weakened honor system.

Were the students par-
ticipating in their exams this
spring under the impression
that ‘anything goes’ as the days
of the honor system is
something of the past?

The alumni must believe that
the administration today has
weakened when they realize
that the honor system at W&L is
being treated as just a farce by
the students. Who was the great
American statesman who said
that he had rather be ‘right’
than President (Henry Clay). I
believe that the great majority
of the alumni had rather see
W&L close its doors than to bow
to what the administration
apparently believes is
necessary to be in agreement
with today’s trend. As Abraham
Lincoln said ‘right is right if
nobody is doing it and wrong is
wrong if everybody is doing it’.

We are visiting with Eleanor
and Stuard Wurzburger May 23-
25; and I certainly hope to hear
from you that every effort is
being made by the ad-
ministration to restore the
honor system to the level that it
has enjoyed.

Earl] T. Jones, ’30

Editor:

Congratulations on your
editorial about the Honor
System.

Whether you are right or
wrong, you are being con-
structive. And honest.

If you are wrong, your
editorial will surely strengthen
the Honor System by alerting
everyone involved that at least
you think the system has failed.

If you are right, and like most
graduates I pray you are not,
Washington and Lee is no longer
Washington and Lee.

The name should be changed
to “‘Nixon and Mitchell’’.

I mean that.

There are hundreds of
colleges and universities.

But none could surpass the
Washington and Lee so many of
us knew and loved and
respected because of its Honor
System. Like you, that Honor
System played a major role in
why we went to W&L; that
Honor System was our greatest
inspiration from Washington
and Lee. It has helped us more
than all the classes we ever
took.

So, if you are right and the
Honor System has been sullied,
soiled, and shamed by the
present student body, I hope the
system is done away with and
the school’s name is changed.
Perhaps it should not be
changed to “Nixon and Mit-
chell”’ but to the names of those
student leaders who failed its
traditions of honor.

Robert M. White II ’38

 

Error In

May 17, 1977
Sir:

There has been a great deal of
talk om campus about the Honor
System in recent weeks: does it
work, and who makes it work? I
have some thoughts on the
matter, and this letter is a
result of those thoughts and a
personal experience.

On a recent trip to Goshen, a
friend and I were joking about
the Honor System, viz., ‘‘that is
only counts during school hours,
not on weekends, or off cam-
pus.”’ We stopped at a nearby
store along the way for beer,
cigarettes, and a pair of
sunglasses. I put the sunglasses
on and removed the price tag, to
give to the cashier on the way
out. On the way out, however,
the cashier said nothing, my
friend said nothing, and I said
nothing, and I walked out with a
pair of stolen sunglasses. The
incident was not discussed with
my friend, and was not referred
to again.

Upon a later visit to the store,
alone this time, I included the
sunglasses with my groceries

and paid for them then. My
friend, who had been con-
sidering referring the matter to
the E.C., came to me with his
dilemma. I told him my story,
and he asked me to turn myself
in.

Upon further discussion, we
decided that, in light of the
current campus cynicism and
doubt about the Honor System,
a better solution would be an
open letter to the University
community. We hope to achieve
two things by this: first, to clear
up this particular case, and
more importantly, to argue a
case for the validity of the honor
system.

We think that the Honor
System can work. In this case,
we think it has. Granted, there
will always be honor violations;
the point is that a feeling of
personal honor has prompted

Judgement Or H. V.?

me to make restitution to the
store, and to accept full and
open responsibility for my

. actions. The Honor System

works fine in theory — this time
it has worked in practice as
well. To see it work more often,
I would suggest more openness
and less secrecy in dealing with
honor cases. Perhaps we could
Start a tradition of a convicted
student publishing an open
letter (similar to this), and the
E.C. publicly vidicating in-
nocent students in the same
manner. The advantages of this
policy would be to foster candor
and trust among members of
the community, and would
lessen the prejudice against a
questioned student.

Hunt Brown, ’79

which, coincidentally, he was
invited. He was the organizer
for this year end party right
from the start. But when it went
public, Larkin became a bastion
of fiscal conservatism.

But it seems he hasn’t the
courage of his convictions, or
maybe just the wherewithal,
and so he is now all for using
student funds.

Another rep who is shakey is
law rep Goddard. Following his
courageous stand on the

had hopes for his high moral

too is on a bum trip.

Three cheers for the Honor
System. It seems that Bob
Chiavello had a party out at his
place last weekend and a half
full keg of beer just up and
disappeared. We all know how
W&L men drink, but swallowing
the container too? Really,
gentlemen! Such manners.

Mike Gallagher, noted editor,
world traveler and bon vivant,
just can’t seem to turn off that
animal magnetism. At a party
at Goshen last Friday, two
young ladies of impeccable
breeding just totally lost control
of their senses and begged our
hero for the opportunity to rub
suntan oil on his back. MG,
repelled by the 200 plus pounds

forced to politely decline. Too
bad, the Nose has to apply the
sun oil all by its lonesome.

There is a big flap going on
between the powers that be and
the Calyx editorial staff over a
picture of dubious propriety.

more obvious if he had taken out
the offending part than it was by
leaving the picture in. After all,
it took a week to find it! Well,

If he had been elected

Goldwater said the military

there are some groups in the

forcing it into unilateral
disarmament — disarmament
of the U. S. without disar-

power, he said. He then made
an analogy between nations and
little children at recess.
Goldwater said when he was a
boy it was inevitable that every
recess he’d get into a fight with
someone, but he had never had
to fight someone again who he
had whipped, or someone who
knew Goldwater could whip
him. If the United States was in
a position to whip any nation
that tried to attack it, no one
would try, he said. “‘When we
decide to be strong we won’t
have to go to war,” he said.

Goldwater said that if the
United States had had a ‘‘strong
political posture” with regard
to its allies, World War II never
would have happened. Hitler
never intended to go to war, he
said, but our weak political
posture, because of
isolationism, allowed him to
make his move. Goldwater said
he sees the ‘“‘same feeling of

isolationism of the period of the
’30s’’ today, and this is
dangerous.

The Senator said we are
“driving toward global con-
flict’ caused by a ‘‘scenario of
miscalculations.”’ He said there
are ‘‘many scenarios for
another Korea.’’ He indicated
that one of these scenarios
might be in Panama. He said if
Panama decided to go to war he
doesn’t think the United States
would fight. He said that one of
the reasons for this is because of
a heavily-armed Cuba. If
Panama doesn’t get a “fair
share”’ in negotiations with the
U. S., they will go to war,
predicted Goldwater.

Goldwater said the Russians
are our “‘logical enemy.” “We
are watching them in the most
extensive war preparations in
history,’ he said. Goldwater
said the Russian navy is better
than our navy, but the U. S.
navy “can still function as a
two-ocean navy.’’ Goldwater
assessed the U. S. Air Force as
superior to the Russian coun-
terpart. He said the reason for
this is that the U. S. has fought
two air wars since the Russians
fought their last. Goldwater
also said the U. S. is superior in
computer technology. The
Russians are 20 years behind in
computer technology, he said.
He said the reason for this is
that the Russians ‘‘are not good
copiers.”’ ‘‘You give the
Japanese something and
they’ve got it,” he said, but the
Russians ‘‘don’t catch on fast.”’
million for each advanced
fighter plane made in the U. S.,
he said. He also said weapons
systems are also getting more
expensive. Some bombers, with
six missiles aboard, carry about
$1 million worth of ammunition,
ne said.

The audience, which gave
Goldwater a standing ovation
when he was _ introduced,
nevertheless asked the senator
some tough estions when

with mafia figures. The senato
denied any knowledge of th
figures’ mafia ties or any close
and intimate friendship with
any of the figures. Talking
about one figure, Willy Bailov,
he said the mafia ‘‘blew hi
up.” “They did a good job. All
they found was his thumb,”’ the
Arizona senator said.

Finally, Goldwater told the
youthful crowd never to give up
on our political system.
‘“‘Maintain an interest in our
country,” he said. ‘The country
comes before the party,’’ the
senator said.

earlier about voice; he really
understood his wry, un-
derstated part in the show, and
added a lot to its success.

Most actors love applause,
even if they won’t admit it, but
after the Requiem, no one
seemed inclined to indulge
them. No one was willing to be
the first to break the spell, to
move their souls from’ im-

theatre where their bodies were

full justice to Simon’s in-

you intend to see this finale to

8 THE RING-1UM PHI
Land Fraud

(continued from page 2)

Once the teams swung into
high gear, it was obvious the
class had stumbled upon a
larger mess than it had an-
ticipated. Bales had been
responsible for several in-
famous apartment construction
and suburban development
projects in southwest Virginia.
Rakes had terved time in prison
for a variety of offenses. Both
were in hot water with a
number of banks.

Four trips to the Bristol-
Abingdon area, two to Bluefield,
W. Va., several to Harrisonburg
and Staunton, a number to
Roanoke and Richmond, and
one to Kentucky yielded
members of the class a con-
siderable amount of in-
formation. What they have are
profiles of several exceedingly
‘slick’? businessmen who
operate in the ‘‘grey” area of
the law. Leads stretch from
New Jersey to Florida. If the
amount of information the class
now has is enormous, then the
amount left to be uncovered is
simply colossal.

In the process of the in-
vestigation, it became obvious
that others had come before —
the FBI, the State Police, the
Internal Revenue Service. But
yet the whole story had never
seen print. Individual pieces of
the story had found their way
into papers, but only when they
directly concerned the
respective circulation areas.
People in Bristol did not know
what had occurred in West
Virginia, and vice-versa. The
story, for the most part, was all
out in the open; it had just never
been pulled together before.

Most of the story of the ac-
tivities of Bales, Rakes, Berry,
and their associates (including
Sheffield) has been assembled.
This week it is being whittled
down to a workable size — a
series of three or four articles.
The class wants to have its
findings published, to warn
people before any more ven-
tures reach fruitation. Already,
the Roanoke, Bristol and
Bluefield papers have ex-
pressed interest in running the
story. With any luck at all, the
story should see print in the
next month.

looks like he knows what he’’s
doing.

Ed Backus, printmaster
emeritus. Though retired, Ed
deserves this award as much as
anybody. Ed’s printing finesse
is legend, but it’s as a human
being that he’s missed the most
around the Shop.

The W&L Print Shop is
something special, and it’s the
staff that makes it so. The
decision made by the University
administration earlier this year
to eliminate a majority of the
Shop’s print operations will, if
fully realized, mean the end of
the Print Shop as it is now
known. Persons close to the
real, if lost, spirit of this
University will then mourn the
death of an honorable tradition.
