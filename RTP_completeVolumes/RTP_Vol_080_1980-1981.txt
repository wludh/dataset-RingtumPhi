Frat Maintenance Plan Unveiled

by Mike Perry

University officials met with
fraternity presidents and
treasurers Tuesday evening to
explain and discuss implemen-
tation of a new system whereby
the University will perform
maintenance services and pro-
vide bookeeping aid to
Washington and Lee’s 17 frater-
nities.

Dean of Fraternity Affairs
Dan Murphy explained that the
creation of the program grew
out of the recommendations in a
report by a special ad hoc com-
mittee on Fraternity Financial
Relations. The committee was
comprised of administration,
faculty members and last
year’s Interfraternity Council
President Syd Farrar.

Murphy indicated that the
need for such a program came
in response to the report’s con-
tention that fraternities have
problems obtaining satisfactory
maintenance services and need
a clearer understanding of
where they stand financially
from month to month.

The program is certain to be
adopted by the IFC because as
University President Robert

Huntley stated in a letter to all
fraternity presidents, “failure
to participate will mean
withdrawl of the University’s
recognition of’? any non-
complying fraternity.

Murphy went on to explain
that in an effort to make the
costs of the program ($2800)
“more palatable,” fraternities
obligated by University loan re-
quirements to set aside $3000 in
a reserve maintenance fund
will be permitted to divert pay-
ment of this year’s sum toward
the costs of the program, and
that efforts would be made to
alleviate any financial strains
placed on other fraternities not
receiving University loans.

Superintendent of Building
and Grounds Jim Arthur ex-
plained that he conducted an in-
spection of all but one fraternity
and designed the maintenance
program. Under Arthur’s plan,
each fraternity will be billed
$2800 for the year and will be
visited by a plumber and elec-
trician at least once a week.

Fraternities may call on one
or two additional Buildings and
Grounds staff members to
make repairs with the excep-

tion of ice makers,
refrigerators and other
household appliances. Arthur
also noted that fraternities
would pay for what he termede
‘“‘major repairs,”’ following con-
sultation with house officials,
and any supplies over $10 in-
stalled during a particular visit.

Under the provisions of the
maintenance program, fire ex-
tinguishers will also be refilled
at wholesale cost by the
Buildings and Grounds Depart-
ment.

University Treasurer E.
Stewart Epley outlined a finan-
cial services program in which
each fraternity will be required
to submit ‘‘a simple financial
statement,” or any similar na-
tional fraternity report, on a
monthly basis to the University.
Epley reported that the Univer-
sity has contracted a book-
keeper, the accountant to the
fraternities through the IFC, to
assist fraternities in the
preparation of these reports.

Epley emphasized that Miss
Lowery will no longer be
available to prepare other
reports such as state and
federal tax returns on behalf of

EC Sets Guidelines

by W. Cope Moyers

The Executive Committee
Monday night approved two
motions and issued a three-page
memorandum designed to
maintaining proper relations
between itself and the many
campus subcommittees.

At its first meeting of the new
academic year, the committee
issued its memorandum to all
subcommittees outlining its ex-

pectations concerning this
year’s budget requests and
monthly reports.

E.C. President Bob Willis
said in the memorandum that
the committee will not accept
budgets or requests for student
body funds unless the subcom-
mittees follow guidelines
established by the Executive
Committee.

panied by the amounts re-
quested and received by each
committee during the past two
years and a detailed account of
the final year-end expenditures
and assets for 1979-80.

The Executive Committee
will also require each subcom-
mittee to submit written month-
ly reports on its activities. In-
cluded in the monthly reports
are a report of recent activities
and planned activities; a cur-
rent financial statement and,
according to the memorandum,
“a concise, detailed financial
statement on specific events.’’

In addition to the memoran-
dum, the Executive Committee
passed two motions exerting
more control over subcom-
mittee appointments of
freshmen and first-year law
students.

The first motion passed re-
quires subcommittee chairmen
to appear before the Executive
Committee on September 29
and explain their policies on the
selection of freshmen and new
law students.

charged to each fraternity for
this service.

Epley also annouced that the
University is in the process of
developing a manual to assist
fraternity treasurers that
should be available by the first
week of next year.

Fraternity representatives

voiced concern over the origin
of the $2800 maintenance figure.

Dining Hall Wins Awards

Both awards were in the
category of residence hall din-
ing, one for W&L’s regular
residence hall menus and one
for a special-event menu.

Though many students are
quick to criticize the food in the
dining hall, compared to food
services at other universities
the Washington and Lee dining
hall stands up well.

Gerald J. Darrell,
Washington and Lee’s director
of food services, received two of
four first-place awards this
summer in a menu exchange
contest sponsored by the Na-
tional Association of College
and University Food Services.

It was the first time that
Washington and Lee entered the
National Competition which in-
cludes some of the largest
universities in the nation.

Chi Psi Renovates Ann Smith

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s newest social fraternity,
Chi Psi, has moved into its new
home in the former Ann Smith
School building located at the
corner of Nelson Street and Lee
Avenue. The structure houses
all of Chi Psi’s 20 members as
they gear up for this fall’s
fraternity rush.

Chi Psi’s. national head-
quarters has already chipped in

The award for regular
residence hall meals was based
on menus submitted from
Evans Dining Hall’s standard
four week cycle. The special-
event menu was based on a
Chinese Lantern Festival din-
ner celebrating the first full
moon of the Year of the Monkey
in March.

An authentic Chinese meal
was prepared by Evans Hall’s
Chef Charles Dunn with
assistance in planning by Mrs.
I-Hsiung Ju, wife of W&L’s
artist-in-residence, and the din-

more than $100,000 toward the
renovation of the building and
the total costs are expected to
reach $250,000. Renovation on
the building’s second floor,
where most bedrooms are
located, is complete, but
renovation of the first floor is
only partially complete. Work
has not yet begun on the base-
ment. When all the renovation
work is completed, the fraterni-

ing hall was decorated with
Chinese lanterns.

But Darrell said he is more
pleased with the award for the
regular menu _ because _ it
reflects what the dining hall can
do.

Darrell competed against the
other 500-member institutions
of the association at its annual
conference in Washington D.C.
in July. Runners-up included
Oklahoma State University, the
University of Pennsylvania,
and Kansas State University.

Darrell has been director of
food services at Washington
and Lee since 1969 and is vice
president of the association’s
regional organization.

several large meeting rooms as
well as bedrooms as well as
bedrooms for 30 additonal
students, although the
timetable is still indefinite.

Like W&L’s other frater-
nities, Chi Psi will pay full city
taxes on the value of the
building itself, but will be ex-
empt from property taxes on
the fraternity’s land which is

Smith Wins NCAA Grant| News Briefs

Scott E. Smith, a four-year
football letterman at
Washington and Lee has been
awarded a $2000 NCAA post-
graduate scholarship. Smith is
the eighth W&L student athlete
and fifth football player to earn
the award, which was initiated
for the 1964-65 academic year.

“Scott has been an outstan-
ding leader at W&L on the foot-
ball field, in the classroom, and
around the University com-
munity,” stated W&L athletic
director and physical education
department chairman William
D, McHenry. “He is one of the
finest offensive lineman we
have had in recent years; he
has performed admirably as a
sergeant-major in our ROTC
program; and has done com-
mendable jobs as a University
Federation tutor and as a news
and sports commentator on the

The second motion gives the
Executive Committee power to
veto any new appointments to.
the various subcommittees.

‘We need to assure selection
of qualified persons,” Willis
said.

In an attempt to keep itself in-
formed of subcommittee ac-
tivities, the Executive Commit-
tee decided to have its members

Dean’s List recognition eight
times and Honor Roll recogni-
tion six times. He will use the
scholarship at McGill Universi-
ty, located in Montreal,
Canada.

A four-year starter at offen-
sive guard, Smith earned Old

second-team honors as a
sophomore and first-team
laurels as a junior and senior.
This past fall he served as team
captain along with classmates
Stewart Atkinson, Jr. and Syd
Farrar.

Marshall Clark will serve as

vention committee and Voting
Regulations Board.

Jeff Edwards was appointed
as an ad hoc member to the
Cold Check Committee, Tripp
Brower to Student Control and
Frank Smith on Contact. Jim
Vines was appointed to the
Publications Board.

“Scott’s performance as a
W&L football player was
outstanding,” said Gary Fallon,
head coach at W&L since 1978.
“He was an intense, conscien-
tious, and unselfish worker who
gave our younger players con-
fidence and encouragement.

“There’s no doubt in anyone’s
mind that the success and pro-
gress we’ve had here at W&L is
largely due to people like
Scott.”

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s seven other NCAA post-
graduate scholarship winners

Purvis Out

Life went on at Washington
and Lee this summer even
though the students were scat-
tered across the nation and
world.

One of the top news items was
a decision by the city of Lex-
ington to dismiss Lt. Jack Pur-
vis from the police force.

Purvis, according to a memo
released by the city, violated a
city code for law officials. He
was given an opportunity to
resign following a hearing but
did not do so. Instead he waited
to be dismissed.

‘Best SBA’

Over at the Law School, the
Student Bar Association was
named ‘Best SBA’ in the
United States by the law student
division of the American Bar
Association.

And, believe it or not, the
W&L law school paper, The
Law News, tied with the Univer-
sity of Virginia law newspaper
for the “‘best in the southeast”’
honors. The paper is published
by the SBA.

Warm, Shallow ‘Lagoon’

Columbia Pictures Presents a
Randal Kleiser Film
The Blue Lagoon
Starring Brooke Shields
Introducing Christopher Atkins

Director of Photography
Nestor Almendros
Screenplay by
Douglas Day Stewart
Produced and Directed by
Randal Kleiser

by John Wells

The Blue Lagoon, which is be-
ing held for an additional week
at the State Theatre, is a
moderately entertaining, well-
photographed fantasy which
deserves more notoriety for its
salacious publicity than for any
actual content.

The story, based on an an-
cient novel and filmed in 1949
with British actress Jean Sim-
mons, concerns two young
cousins shipwrecked at an early
age who grow to maturity and
eventually find ‘‘natural love”
onan exotic island.

Fifteen year-old Brooke
Shields, who gained fame as the
bawdyhouse child in Louis
Malle’s Pretty Baby is found to
display more modesty in her
latest film. In those scenes re-
quiring her to go topless, the
young star wears hair pasted to
her cleavage which creates a
kind of immobile hairdo in
storms and underwater. Any
scene exhibiting more flesh
than television would permit is
filled by Miss Shields’ 33 year-
old double, These scenes are not
difficult to detect.

Some of the films most
humorous sequences deal with
the male star, a newcomer
named Christopher Atkins — as
he builds the two of them at hut
that puts the Swiss Family
Robinson to shame. The dwell-
ing, along with numerous items
saved and preserved from the
doomed voyage, actually brings
to mind the absurdities of
Gilligan!s Island. One half ex-
pects to see Atkins driving a
thatched car about, or Shields
pushing around a bamboo shop-
ping cart (ala Ginger and Mary
Anne) looking for food.

But now wait a_ minute,
there’s a plot here somewhere
—I think. Actually, what it boils
down to is this — they grow up
and discover natives on the
island and have spats and make
up and he discovers his
manliness before she discovers
he womanliness and he wants to
but she doesn’t and then they
have a big fight but then they
both, mutually and
simultaneously discover
‘natural love.”’

Brooke Shields is admittedly
the most beautiful child star
since Elizabeth Taylor in the
mid-1040’s. Without a studio to
guide her career (Liz had M-G-
M), Miss Shields has found
herself in several films which
have clicked neither critically
nor commercially (Just You
and Me, Kid, Wanda Nevada,
etc.) Lagoon affords her
beautiful camera angles and a
showcase for her untrained and
unremarkable — but certainly

Freshman Guide

 

not bad — talent. She comes
across as less stuck-up than her
Calvin Klein commercials
would indicate. And she sure
does look nice!

Christopher Atkins seems to
have taken the whole thing
more seriously — perhaps a bit
too seriously — than his co-star,
but comes across well in a scene
or two. Particularly after he
has thrown his natural bride’s
belongings from the second
floor balcony window of their
grass roof beach estate and
subsequently apologizes.

Since the dialogue is carried
on between two uneducated
adolescents who have more or
less raised themselves in an
adult-free world, the screenplay
is not of a scintillating nature.
Lacking the professional exper-
tise to effectively counter this

deficiency, the young stars are -

ultimately disappointing in
crucial scenes (of which there
are relatively few).

The entire production is
beautifully photographed, with
bright, colorful beaches, coral
and fish, and, certainly, the at-
tractive couple themselves who
always look perfect. This is a
light, reasonably diverting
entertainment which contains
sex, scenes which may tend to
disappoint: The ‘‘plot’’ is sus-
tained chiefly through occa-
sional shots of the stars’ (and
double’s) glowing bodies, and
ever-watching tropical wild life.
In fact, the animals appear to
be having a better time observ-
ing than we do.

Film Notes

Casino Royale (Great Britain, 1967) — Producer Charles K.
Feldman thought it would be a neat idea to make an all-star James
Bond movie, with a bunch of swell directors thrown in to do what
they do best. The resulting chaos is brought to us this weekend by
the SAB. The extraordinary cast includes Peter Sellers, David
Niven, Woody Allen (who co-wrote), Ursula Andress, William
Holden, Deborah Kerr, Orson Welles (who, in 1967, had not reached
his current dimensions), George Raft, Joanna Pettet and Terence
Cooper among others. The principal director (and the best known)
is John Huston. The result is intermittently funny, but you may
have noticed they never tried to do it like this again. Presented by
the SAB, Friday through Sunday, September 19-21, at 7 and 9 p.m.
in duPont Auditorium. Admission is $1.

 

 

NOTICE — The SAB will hold its first meeting tonight (Thursday)

at 7:00, in which a proposal to move the Fancy Dress Ball from Fri-

day to Saturday night will be discussed. The meeting is open to the

student body and we encourage any student input. We are located
in room 208 in the University Center.

ON THE ROAD : RANDOLPH-MACON

_/ sone who is willing to risk
life and limb on the 40-mile road
to Lynchburg might also be
willing to make a stop at
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege. Affectionately called
‘“‘Randy-Mac”’ by a few of its
students, some of Lexington’s
Minks have been known to call
it the ‘‘Nunnery”’ and its women
“Macon bacon’’; one alum from
the class of 1923 says in his day
it was called ‘“‘Randolph’s Col-
lege for Makin Women.”

In any event, freshmen who
give in to a ‘‘Randy-Mac at-
tack”’’ will find a picturesque
college located on 100 acres just
inside Lynchburg. There are
pines house parties and the Dell
for warm weather outdoor par-
ties and Smith Hall for mixers.
The outside parties are usually
good but the Smith Hall parties
are crowded and beer runs
short. You can expect to pay
three dollars at the door and a

quarter a beer, if youcan get to ~

it while it lasts.

 

Dating Macon girls, or
women as they prefer to be call-
ed, can be interesting and a real
challenge. Macon’s security is
tight and seems to constrict
more each year, strongly con-
tributing to the monastic im-
age. Males must be accom-
panied by females when in the
dorms and unengaged_ up-
perclasswomen are quick to see
that underclasswomen do not
get all the dates and that males
do not freely roam the halls.

However, should you decide
to try your hand at roaming the
halls at Macon, there are two
good tricks. One is to head for
the bathroom in the main hall:
Once you are past the first
check point, sprint up the spiral
stairs and try to look in-
conspicuous. If that manuever
fails, try the fire escapes, but
don’t get caught! Security at
Macon warns us. that
trespassers will be dealt with
harshly. toa

By this time chances are you
have been thrown out of the
dorms and driven out of town.
But if you have not been run out
of town, you will probably want
to take your Macon date
somewhere beside the Macon
campus, and fortunately there
are some good night spots
around Lynchburg. The Sow’s
Ear provides excellent enter-
tainment, and several good
bars which occasionally feature
live music are on the other side
of town. Should all else fail, you
can go to Lynchburg College.

And when the night is done
and you have taken your date
back to the Main Hall fortress,
you will probably want a bite to
eat. The best late night snack
can be found at the Texas Inn.
Just ask for the Cheesey
Western, all the way. If you
don’t get killed in the parking
lot, the Texas Inn can be a great
place to stop before heading
back over the mountain-to.Lex:

the first Washington and Lee
baseball player named to an
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference all-league team, has
gained another first for the
Generals.

Ellis has been named to the
American Association of
Baseball Coaches NCAA Divi-
sion III third team, marking the
first time a W&L player has
received recognition from the
AABC. Ellis, who plays center-
field for W&L, is one of 11
players on the third team and
one of 33 recognized by the
Association.

Ellis started in all 18 games

W&L, VMI

If at first you succeed, then by
all means do it again.

In October 1979, the W&L golf
Generals joined forces with
their counterparts across town

this season to earn his second
varsity letter. He paced the
Generals with a .393 batting
average and 24 hits, and also
batted in eight runs as the
Generals compiled a_ 5-13
overall record and a 5-7 ODAC
mark.

“Thad did an exceptional job
in all phases of the game and
richly deserves the All-
American honor,’ comments
W&L head coach Chuck Kroll on
his team captain. ‘‘He handled
his responsibilities well as team
leader; he improved his batting
average by 60 points this spring
over his freshman season and
he kept base runners from scor-
ing with his accurate throwing.

“A further impressive note

about Thad is that he’s still im-
proving,” Kroll adds. ‘He
knows he hasn’t reached his top
form and won’t be satisfied un-
til he does. We expect him to be
even better next spring.”’

“He’s a super individual, a
super athlete, and a super guy
to coach,” concludes Kroll, who
this spring completed his se-

‘cond year at the Generals’

helm.

Ellis, who as a freshman also
led W&L in batting with a .329
average, played this summer
for the Waynesboro ‘“‘Generals”’
of the Shenandoah Valley
League. Next spring he will join
senior Tommy Coates as cap-
tain of the W&L squad.

men, the university said. There
were 1,413 applications for ad-
mission — the highest number
since 1966 and a 30 percent in-

The Washington and Lee var-
sity football team ended a seven
year opening game drought
with an impressive 12-8 come-
from-behind victory over the
Delaware Valley College Ag-
gies.

The Generals not only won
their first opening game since
defeating Hamilton College 29-7
in 1973, but avenged last year’s
30-0 loss at the hands of
Delaware Valley.

“We've come a long way
since last year’s 30-0 loss,”’ said
Head Coach Gary Fallon, now
in his third year. ‘Personality
wise, this is a very confident
team.”

Ten minutes into the game,
Delaware Valley blocked a

W&L punt attempt and
recovered the ball in the
Generals’ endzone to give the
Aggies a quick 8-0 lead.

W&L cut the lead to 8-6 late in
the second period as tight end
Jim Stanley recovered
sophomore tailback Chris
Cavalline’s fumble in
Delaware’s endzone.

Tailback is a new position for
Cavalline, who battled with
both Jim Wenke and Rich
Hachenburg for the starting
quarterback position last year.
Explains Fallon: “By moving

Cavalline to tailback we have
acquired a triple threat. He can

not only run and pass, but we
can also use him in quick-kick
situations.”

The Cavalline move is part of
Fallon’s plan to open up the of-
fense. W&L won the Delaware

For All Armchair Quarterbacks,
Verdict Still Out on Generals

by Bill Whalen

And so after two weeks of this
young football season, we still
have to sit back and withhold
any judgment on this year’s
W&L squad. The main reason is
that the Generals have played
two games and given two dif-
ferent types of performances.
The team that opened in Lex-
ington was, hopefully, a
preview of the future. The team
that played last Saturday in
Gettysburg was a reminder of
the dark past.

At this point, it would be too
easy to say that the Generals
were lousy last Saturday. It
would also be unfair. One has to
remember that this is still a
young team and, when you're
away from home, young and in
trouble, things have a way of
going from good to bad to worse
in a matter of minutes. Last
Saturday in Gettysburg, the
Generals went through that

type of cycle.

So if you’re still trying to
figure out what this team is
capable of, this Saturday’s
game will serve as a good
benchmark. Last year, the
Generals lost to Emory &
Henry, 12-6, in a game they.
could have won, probably
should have won, but didn’t.
Such a game is typical of the
way football has been in this
town over the past few years.

If the Generals are for real,
then we should be able to tell
after this week’s contest. Over
the past four years, W&L has
lost to E&H by margins of six
points, seven points and twice
by one point. If W&L has made
it over the hump of losing this
year, then a defeat of this type
of nuisance would serve as
strong evidence.

But win or lose, the Generals
have joined the ranks of
countless other football teams
in the adoption of a team gim-
mick. Look around the NFL,

and you'll find that most teams
have some type of nickname or
habit which a small group of
players have started. I suppose
this began a few years ago with
the Oakland Raiders and their
black towels, but now the habit
has spread to Lexington.

I’m referring, of course, to
the ‘‘Bald Eagles,’’ a group of
players who decided to shave
their heads. You may be repuls-
ed at the thought of this, but
don’t forget: these stints usual-
ly work. Remember the
Georgia Bulldogs of 1976? They
too shaved their heads, called
themselves the ‘Junkyard
Dogs’’ and went on to defeat
Alabama and go to the Sugar
Bowl (where they lost to No. 1
Pittsburgh). Anyway, it worked
for Georgia, maybe it can also
work for the Generals.

A little team spirit never hurt
anyone, especially in this in-
stance.

C

Chris Cavalline carries the ball around right end, following the block on Chip Forte (No. 64) and Andy

a

then raced 55 yards down the
sideline for the score.

Although the Aggies mounted
a late drive moving to the W&L
one-yard line, the Generals
made a goal line stand and, on
third and goal, recovered a bob-
bled snap to ice the victory.

Last Saturday the Gettysburg
Bullets evened the Generals’
record at 1-1, trouncing W&L
28-0.

Said Fallon: ‘‘We simply fac-
ed a better team offensively in
Gettysburg. We thought we had
the right game plan and stuck
with it, but they caught us with

. alot of misdirection plays.”’

The second quarter was
disastrous for W&L as_ the
Bullets scored three quick
touchdowns. The last Get-
tysburg score came on a 51 yard
drive late in the fourth quarter.

Cavalline led W&L’s rushing
effort for the second time in two
games, gaining 73 yards on 19
carries.

Overall, says Fallon, ‘‘the
team is looking ahead with con-
fidence. The defense is playing
as a cohesive unit and is made
up of several third year
Starters’? (such as Mike
Pressler, Dave Nichols and
Tommy Noble).

This Saturday the Generals
will take on Emory & Henry at
home in W&L’s first ODAC
game of the season. Fallon
describes E&H as a “scrappy,
hungry team that always gives
us a tough time.”

In last year’s meeting Emory
& Henry held off a W&L come-
back to win 12-6. Game-time is
1:30 at Wilson Field.

One of the first RE-ELECT PRESIDENT CARTER commercials
broadcast since Labor Day took place on September 3 at 10:55 p.m.,
following a T.V. movie on C.B.S. The ad, portions of which were in-
cluded in a film shown at the Democratic National Convention this
summer, seeks to portray the Chief Executive as a strong, sensitive
leader in an unstable world.

Gerald Rafshoon knows what to say and what not to say in a slick
package which looks pretty but which apparently is not aimed at
the thoughtful, intelligent voter. Since such voters were not crucial
in squeaking Jimmy over the top in 1976, these tactics are
understandable. The Carters have lived in the White House for
three and one-half years now, and Rafshoon has more impressive
footage for commercial use — a sharp contrast to the previous
campaign ads which relied heavily on colorful panoramas of fruit
trees and county fairs with spurts of country music lest we forget
Jimmy was from Plains.

In 1980 we see a presidential-looking Carter waving from
airplane ramps and discussing obviously important stuff with Jody
Powell inside a moving limosine. An anonymous, rather solid-
sounding voice tells how the president has become such a world
figure in recent years (this might come as a surprise to Mr.
Carter’s predecessors).

Against a background of symphonic music we see: the
Commander-in-Chief conferring with various world leaders; a
sober-faced Carter, in tails yet, laying a wreath at the grave of
Japanese Prime Minister O’Hira; the inevitable footage of the
Camp David Accord Hand Clasp (a clip which will undoubtedly be
yellow and grainy by election day). We are told by the narrator how
sensitive and intelligent the President is; so wonderful is. Jimmy
that he can carry on a “cordial” relationship with the Pope, and
still deal with the leaders of Communist China. Such awesome
public figures as the Vice-President, Sen. Inouye of Hawaii, and Lt.
Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York extoll His domestic awareness,
prowess in foreign affairs, and sheer brilliance, respectively. The
effort is to make Jimmy Carter look presidential.

Such an effort may also be found within the White House in
manipulating the President’s activities, and, indeed the govern-
ment, for political purposes.

The Republican National Chairman, Bill Brock, charged on
September 11 that Carter has abused the powers of incumbency in

 

Campaigning Carter Style

the current campaign. According to the Washington Post, the
R.N.C. is “filling 29 Freedom of Information Act requests with
government agencies for details of travel and public appearances”
by administration officials.

What about Carter’s media-staged events, which surpass any
charge against Ronald Reagan for playing ‘‘cheap politics’’?

A conspicuous example is the recent flutter of belated Medal of
Honor presentations since August. Before the Democratic conven-
tion, Carter was seen on national television with a World War II
veteran whose request for recognition had been lost somewhere in
the bureaucracy. Until it was suddenly found, so Jimmy could
make a dramatic presentation, embrace the obviously moved reci-
pient, and turn to the camera just in time to wipe an apparent tear
from his right eye.

And just last Friday yet another belated medal was bestowed
with many tears and hugs, this time upon an Italian-American
veteran in a Rose Garden ceremony which also marked the an-
nouncement of credit guarantees for Poland. This allowed Jimmy
to look human as well as presidential on the front page and grab a
few ethnic votes as well.

In a special report written earlier this year, Chief of Staff
Hamilton Jordan noted that President Ford had not used the in-
cumbancy to its fullest potential during the 1976 campaign. No such
charges can be leveled against Carter. He has used public funds for
countless “‘nonpolitical’’ White House briefings for ‘‘community
leaders.’’ Until law took effect this month requiring the campaign
funds pay for campaign travel, Rosalynn Carter hauled Air Force
One all over the country for single appearances. Her husband did
the same after world matters became more ‘‘manageable”’ last
spring and, the nomination sewed up, he left his crises in the oval
office. Now a smaller, less expensive military plane is used for
political trips.

Using cabinet secretaries to politicize their offices is a low tactic:
appealing to voter sympathy by turning a sacred honor into a cheap
photo opportunity sinks lower still. These methods are becoming a
hallmark of the President’s campaign, which seeks to highlight the
candidate as a man of the highest personal character.

Council Tuesday evening and outlined a maintenance ArT
program it thinks will get and keep fraternities in of ea
shape. Though the program will cost each house near- a y ay

8

' ly $3,000, it will more than pay for itself in the long
run. And the Administration has made a genuine and
sincere effort to, in the words of Dean Murphy, make
the “program more palatable.” In truth, the idea of
regular low-cost maintenance may be the saving
grace for the fraternity system.

The only problem with the whole scheme is the way
fraternities were handed the package. Most fraterni-
ty members read about the plan in the paper when
they got back to Lexington and house presidents
received a letter about the program this summer. But
on the whole, the program came as an unbudgeted
surprise and as a result caused no small amount of
resentment. In his inaugural speech, President
Huntley stressed the fact at Washington and Lee the
students and faculty entrusted with the largest
measure of freedom and choice possible. Yet the
President announced that any fraternities not com- ese : .
plying with the maintenance problem would no longer Fraternities e An endang ered species ?
be recognized by the University. That sounds like an
offer the Godfather could hardly turn down.

 

We think the program is a good one and will be a
great benefit to fraternities especially in the long run.
If the administration had pursued a more reasonable
strategy the maintenance program would have
received the kind of positive response it deserves.

Four score and seven days ago, I returned to the Hallowed Hill
for Studly Sons of Confederate Heroes. My urge to matriculate
quickly faded, for Little Mary’s School for Art-History Majors and
Aspiring Brides stirred within me a greater interest. This son also
rises. With a dedicated fraternity bro (John), I packed two prospec-
tive pledges, a case of Bud, and other essentials in my once fine
now trashed road mobile. As usual, I had blown off the C-School,
but what the hell...there’s a lot you can do with a 2.2 when you join
the family bank. The Ax has rusted in his shower, anyway.

The ride to Little Mary’s went well enough. After three years of
crossing the mountain, I knew the curves as well as my third score
five days ago. The freshman were quiet and scared by my apparent
ignorance of hairpin turns, so I tried to start some typically boring
conversation. As it turned out, one of the guys was bid material, but
his roommate played chess all summer and told me he really en-
joyed the the boiler Room Tour. Ball...

We made it through the three security checkpoints and arrived at
the mixer in the Rackcellar. Foamy 10* beer abounded and the
freshmen approached the bar in search of liquid courage. John and
I weren t too psyched by the soul tapes or pastels, but were amused
to see Boris Spasky grab three beers and wander up to some prime
potential. These young innocents giggled as Boris stumbled for an
opening line; “Ah, ehem, ah, d-d-do you d-d-d-drink beer?” Beer
dripped on his feet as he puffed up his shoulders with new-found
confidence. The responding chorus of southern laughter caught the
crowd's attention, John turned to me and said, ‘Man, this is too
much! Let’s cruise the dorms.’’ Another round of howls went as we
left the mixer. Boris had fallen and lay in a puddle. I wondered
who'd give him a ride back.

I found some action on fourth floor Sunker, and John said he’d go
check out some other dorms. The Allman Brothers were cranking
on the stereo down the hall; I’d brought the essentials, and things
were pretty cool. One girl had two jugs of Gallo and I couldn't
resist. We got to talking and she told me that she was an art major
and enjoyed raising caterpillars as a hobby. That sounded too good
to be true and I replied, “Really? This summer I worked on a tuna
trawler and caught tons.”’ She really dug that program.

I told her she was cute, special — even asked her if she was a
senior. But she wanted to hear “I love you.’’ Searching my vast
vocabulary for the right response, I thought, “Bummer, I can’t
handle these aspiring wives...or can I?”’ I fell silent and decided to
play it cool for a while. But she kept insisting: ‘Tell meh yah luv
meh..,.tale meh.”’ This airhead was getting to be too much, but by
the time we had finished the bottle of wine, I figured — go for it. I
didn’t want to lie to her, so I leaned over and drooled, ‘‘Ich
liebedich”’ (stud).

The next morning, I saw John and the freshman faceman munch-
ing happily on cantaloupes in the dining hall. We shot the bull and
decided that we had better head on home. As we were leaving town
I couldn’t believe my eyes. There was Boris thumbing for a ride
and looking like a Cheesy Western outside the Texas Tavern.

Plan Unveiled

(continued from page 1)

Dean Murphy said _ the
University is prepared to invest
‘$60,000 of its own’”’ funds in this
year’s operation of the
maintenance program.

Sigma Chi treasurer Robert
Neely criticized the Universi-
ty’s maintenance program’s
policy of billing all fraternities
the same cost, claiming that
this kind of ‘bad attitude’’
might prompt fraternities to
overuse the program as long as
they must pay a uniform price
regardless of service actually
received.

Dean John explained that all
fraternities will be required to
pay a uniform cost of $2800 to
“help defray startup costs’”’ and
that all costs will be reviewed in
December in hope of adjusting
fees so as to reflect actual use of
the service in the future.

Pi Kappa Phi representitive
Dutch Waldbauer complained
that his fraternity has already
lost ‘12,000 down the drain”’ on
inadequate repairs done in their
bathroom and asked if the
University would be willing to
help fraternities locate compe-
tent contractors to perform
“major repairs.’’ Buildings and
Grounds Superintendent Jim
Arthur said fraternities would
be free to consult him or his of-
fice.

He also accepted Sigma
Alpha Epsilon President
Richard Salmon’s suggestion
that the University Buildings
and Grounds office assist

staff, citing an instance in
which a University Building
and Grounds employee had
done faulty repairs on the house
when contracted privately.

Arthur responded by saying
all employees will be supervis-
ed by foremen and will answer
to the Universtiy’s office of
Buildings and Grounds.

IFC President Monte Briscoe
believes ‘‘the meeting went well
and most fraternities had their
questions about the program
answered.”

Briscoe added that he thinks
the program ‘‘will benefit
fraternities, especially in the
long run.”

W&L Gifts Up

Unrestricted gifts toward
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s day-to-day operating ex-
penses exceeded $1 million in
the year just ended, and addi-
tional records were set in the
size of the average gift, $177,
and in the numbers of gifts at
both the $100 and $1,000 levels.

Gifts through W&L’s annual
fund totaled $1,045,076 as of the
end of June, according to Carter
B. McNeese; associate develop-
ment director who is in charge
of annual giving programs. The
figure reflects an increase of 8.5
percent over last year’s unre-
stricted gift-income total of
$984,203.

+ White Column Inn
30 N. Main Street

In calculating annual-fund
gifts, Washington and Lee
counts only money actually
received by June 30 and in-
cludes no contributions that
carried restrictions or which
went into endowment or toward
other permanent puposes.

The average annual-fund gift,
$177, was up from the previous
year’s $170.

The number of $1,000-and-
above gifts was 319, up from 309
the year before,

Unrestricted income to W&L
through the annual giving fund
has more than doubled in six
years.

Violence Erupts In

Freshman Attacked On Henry St,
Phi Kap Prowler Suspect Arrested

by J. R. Smith

Several students were
assaulted by local youths in an
incident which took place early
Sunday morning.

According to Tommy Pritch-
ard, a W&L freshman, he, along
with a 1980 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee and four Hollins
College students, were attacked
by a group of about ‘8 to 10”
black youths accompanied by
one black woman at approx-
imately 1:00a.m.

Pritchard’s group was walk-
ing from the Phi Delta Theta
house following a party there to
a car parked across the street
on Henry Street. The gang ac-
costed them at the car and
Pritchard asked them to leave
his group alone.

The group continued to
harass the students, and Pritch-
ard turned back toward the
fraternity house for help. The
youths stopped him and ordered
him to return to the car.

When he did return to the
automobile, the assailants
began shoving him around and
took the car keys.

The youths then began to
strike Pritchard. ‘‘They began
to hit me,” said Pritchard, ‘‘and
then someone struck me with
something from behind. I fell
and pretended to be un-
conscious.”

A few of the youths then fled,
but some of them remained and
kicked Pritchard and told him
to get on his feet. The girl in the
group helped the freshman to
his feet and into the car.

The other locals continued to
strike Pritchard and the other
students in the car. At that point
the group was able to drive
away to safety.

The incident occurred over a

period of approximately fifteen
minutes.
“What really bothered me,”
said Pritchard of the incident,
“was that, just a half a block
away, the cops were checking
the noise levels at some of the
fraternities.”

Nothing was stolen in th-
assault.

In a related incident, the Phi
Kappa Sigma fraternity house
was broken into on September
7. According to Tim Weed, a

he was awakened by a man

The prowler was armed with

fleeing when Weed startled
him.

Fraternity Study Released

by Mike Perry

University officials
distributed copies last week of a
report submitted by the Ad Hoc
Committee on Fraternity
Financial Relations appointed
by University President Robert
Huntley.

The report outlined a state-
ment on the current status of
fraternities, made short run
recommendations and recom-
mended ‘‘the construction of a
Fraternity Social Complex” as
a long run objective.

Model C, one of three models
suggested in the report, envi-
sions the construction and
maintenance of a number of
fraternity lodges on the back
campus behind the Law School.
Any equity from the sale of ex-
isting fraternity houses would
be applied toward the construc-
tion of the complex by the
University.

Dean of Fraternity Affairs
Dan Murphy, also a member of
the ad hoc committee, says he
expects student reaction to the
report’s recommendations to be
negative, but adds that ‘‘in the

long run Model C might be the
most viable approach’’ both in
terms of the economic survival
of fraternities at W&L and their
relationship with the Lexington
community.

Murphy admits that the im-
plementation of Model C will
mean more for fraternities than
a change of location. The plan
calls for construction of frater-
nity lodges, to be considered
“primarily social centers’’ and
‘not live-in houses.”’ Displaced
students would be expected to
eat in Evans Dining Hall which
could handle the _ increase
“simply my extending its serv-
ing hours.’’ The report adds
that expanded University hous-
ing would also be required.

Dean Murphy, a W&L alum-
nus and former fraternity
member, adds that the report
reflects the attitude ‘‘perceived
by faculty members that frater-
nities are just a place to party.”
Murphy says the ‘‘Administra-
tion continues to support the
idea of fraternities,’’ but is ask-
ing them to ‘“‘justify their ex-
istence. beyond being just a

place to party.’’ Murphy adds
that many fraternities have
“gotten away from their
ideals.”’

Dean of Students Lewis John,
chairman of the ad hoc commit-
tee, emphasizes that the report
is that of a preliminary commit-
tee and is intended to serve as a
basis for ‘‘widespread discus-
sion before any long range ac-
tion is taken.”’ John is hopeful
that the report will start some
dialogue ‘‘in which all prospec-
tives of viewpoints are given a
fair hearing.”

John also points out that Plan
C is one of three models, none of
which is ‘‘pure’”’ and any long
‘simply by extending its serv-
ing hours.’’ The report adds
we are not wedded to the
report,’’ he said.

Dean John says the Universi-
ty will seek to implement the
short run recommendation of
the report which includes the
administration of the fraternity
maintenance and financial ser-
vices programs. Dean John
states that the University plans

Hollins Student
Rape Reported

by Bill Whalen
and
J.R. Smith

Among the various crimes to
hit the Washington and Lee
community this past week,
perhaps the most important,
yet the most perplexing, is the
“reported rape” involving an
18-year-old Hollins College
freshman.

Reports on the incident vary
from administration to ad-
ministration. The only official
statement has come from Lex-
ington Police Chief James A.
Kirby, who labeled the incident
a “reported rape.”

“We are investigating it as a
reported rape,” said Kirby,
“‘but I’m not saying that it was a

rape.”
According to Kirby, the
‘reported rape’’ was not

reported to the Lexington
Police Department until 6:00
Thursday morning. Chief Kirby
did mention the woman was ad-
mitted to Stonewall Jackson
Hospital, where she stayed for
approximately one hour before
returning to Hollins.

The exact details of the inci-
dent are what remain a
mystery at this time. While Kir-
by labeled the matter a
“reported rape,’’ Hollins Dean
of Students Baylies Willey at
first claimed to have no
knowledge of the incident, then
stated that there actually was
no rape.

When reached by telephone, a
friend of the reported victim
claimed that the rape did occur
as reported. When also reached
by phone, the reported victim
herself refused to give any
statements.

Details of the incident vary
from source to source. Both
sources agree on the time of the
rape, between 11:30 p.m. and 12
midnight on Wednesday,
September 17.

The actual site of the incident
varies from account to account.
The police report states that the
action took place on Washington
St., somewhere between Lee
Avenue and Jefferson St.
Another account gives the site
as being somewhere near the
area between the Doremus
Gymnasium parking lot and the
Graham-Leés dormitory.

Fancy Dress Changes Debated

by Frank Billingsley

The Student Activities Board
is presently debating moving
the Fancy Dress Ball from Fri-
day to Saturday night, with the
co-chairmen at odds on the
issue.

Sophomore co-chairman
Pryse Elam agrees with the
idea. He said, ‘“‘When Fancy
Dress was started again in 1974
it was held on Friday so as not
to conflict with fraternity par-
ties. Now it should be the
highlight of the weekend.”

SAB advisor Mike Capetto
first approached Elam with the
suggestion after a recent study
of Independent life at W&L
showed that holding the Fancy
Dress Ball on Friday night was
inconvenient to Independents.
Their weekend is virtually over
after Friday.

‘Whatever serves most of the
students best should be done,”’
Capetto said. ‘‘If Saturday night
is not inconvenient to frater-
nities, and will make the
weekend better for Indepen-
dents, why not have it on Satur-
day night?”

Senior co-chairman Jamie
Small responded that ‘A Fri-
day night Fancy Dress would
make Saturday night entertain-
ment in the Cockpit possible for
those not desiring to attend
fraternity parties. A University
function on Sunday would also
prolong the weekend for In-
dependents.”

Small also noted that a Satur-
day night FD would follow a
Saturday grain party, and
many persons might miss the
dance. ‘Having the grain party
on Friday night might bother
the administration.’

Elam pointed out that if FD
were on Saturday night then
dates would have more time to
arrive on campus without being
rushed to the dance. This would
particularly benefit law
students who date outside the
surrounding community. How-
ever, Small disagrees. ‘‘Most
dates are here Thursday night
or early Friday. Everyone
comes late to the dance
anyway.”

Elam still advocated that the
Fancy Dress Ball should be the

highlight of the weekend. Small
countered, ‘‘But Fancy Dress is
the highlight of the weekend no
matter when it is. We could
have it at four in the morning
and people would still be here.”

SAB Secretary Blake Wither-
ington, agreeing with Small,
added, ‘‘If all the parties lead
up to Fancy Dress on Saturday
night, people will be too burned
out to enjoy it.”

A clear issue in the matter is
whether the SAB members are
willing to give up a large part of
their weekend for last minute
preparations. A Saturday night
Fancy Dress would require that
they do. Small and Withering-
ton both admitted they would
rather enjoy themselves, but
their first priority is to serving
the students.

Traditionalists should note
that Fancy Dress was always
held on Saturday night until the
dance was discontinued during
the Vietnam era.

A decision will be made at an
open meeting this Sunday night
at 7:00, Room 208, University
Center. All students with com-
ments or suggestions are en-
couraged to attend.

Professors On Leave

Seven Washington and Lee
University teachers are on
leaves of absence this fall,
undertaking research projects
that range from a study of an-
cient Greek economic theory to
physical education in the Com-
munist world.

Three faculty members are
abroad for the fall term: Nor-
man F. Lord, professor of
physical education, who is car-
rying out the research into
sports culture and_physical-
training programs in the Soviet
bloc; Clark R. Mollenhoff, pro-
fessor of journalism, who is in-
vestigating the relationship be-
tween the British press and
England's’ institutions of
government; and Maurice D.
Leach, Jr., W&L’s librarian,
also in England, studying
library support there for college

research programs.

 

Mollenhoff is participating in
the faculty exchange program
between W&L and Oxford
University, and is affiliated
with University College, one of
Oxford’s component _ institu-
tions.

Dr. S. Todd Lowry, professor
of economics, is studying the
economic and legal concepts
that characterized ancient

Greece, and Andrew W.

Six teachers have been added
to the undergraduate faculty at
Washington and Lee. Five of
those will be serving on a tem-
porary basis, either in ex-
change programs or to replace
W&L faculty members on
leaves of absence.

The Ring-tum Phi interview-
ed three professors: Herman A.
Lauter, visiting associate pro-
fessor of philosophy; Lawrence
E. Babits, assistant professor of
anthropology; and E.A. Vin-
cent, visiting professor of
geology. David Bausum, assis-
tant professor of mathematics;
Iain S. McLean, visiting pro-
fessor of politics; and Richard
R. Grefe, instructor and assis-
tant reference and_ public-
services librarian will be
spotlighted in the next issue.

Lauter has taught at Occiden-
tal College in Los Angeles for 17
years, and is currently asso-
ciate professor of philosophy
and chairman of the philosophy
department at Occidental.

‘“‘We’ve lived in Los Angeles
for 23 years, which I guess
makes us native Californians,”
said Lauter, whose wife came
with him to Lexington.

Lauter is at W&L through an
exchange program. ‘Professor
Martin (of W&L’s philosophy
department) thought an ex-
change program would be a
good idea and wrote to Occiden-
tal to see if anyone was in-
terested,’’ said Lauter. ‘‘We
corresponded a while, and I
decided to come here. It’s been
really nice so far.”

Lauter teaches Logic, and a
course entitled ‘“‘Personal Iden-
tity and Immortality,” which
has been taught by professor
Martin. Lauter taught a similar
course at Occidental, and says
that the students are ‘pretty
much alike, except there are

girls at Occidental.”’
Lauter’s interests include
music, movies and “travel

—one of the reasons I’m here.”’
He will be at W&L through the
fall term, then return to Los
Angeles.

Babits, who lived in Pro-
vidence, Rhode Island, before
coming here, is replacing a
W&L professor on a leave of
absence this year.

He also came to Washington
and Lee because he has ‘‘been
doing a lot of research oriented
toward the Piedmont south for a
long time, and there is also an
ongoing research program here
that’s related to my own in-
terests, which was very for-
tunate,”’ he said.

This fall, Babits is teaching
Survey Anthropology, Anthro-
pological Theory and Physical
Anthropology. In the winter, In-
troductory Anthropology and
North American Prehistory.

This spring he’ll be working
with a field group, which will be
making a dig at a site to be
determinated by the Survey An-
thropology class this fall.

“The Survey course is going
to accurately assess the
relative importance of a series
of sites in the western. part of
the county,” Babits said. ‘‘Bas-
ed on that analysis, then we’ll
decide which sites we’re going
to dig.”

The sites consist of ‘‘isolated
farmsteads, ruined log cabins,”
said Babits, and the survey

Interviews With New Members Of Faculty

 

New faculty at Washington and Lee University, from left to right: James T. Yashiro, visiting professor
of religion; Richard Mogavero, visiting instructor in drama; Herman A. Lauter, visiting associate pro-
fessor of philosophy; Ellen Jervey, lecturer in drama; David Bausum, assistant professor of
mathematics; E.A. Vincent, visiting professor of geology; Bruce H. Herrick, professor of economics
and head of the department; Samuel E. Stumpf Jr., assistant professor of law; Herbert Fingerette,
Frances Lewis scholar-in-residence in the School of Law; William S. Geimer, assistant professor of law;
Thomas L. Shaffer, professor of law; Richard F. Grefe, instructor and assistant reference and public-
services librarian; and Lawrence E. Babits, assistant professor of anthropology.

 

Vincent was invited to W&L
by Professor Ed Spencer, head

of the geology department, as

part of the exchange program
between Oxford and W&L. He
and his wife came earlier in the
summer and travelled through
Montana, Utah and Arizona
before arriving in Lexington.

Vincent is enjoying his stay in

Lexington ‘‘thoroughly. It
sounds trite, doesn’t it, but I
happen to think that everybody
is so extraordinarily friendly
and welcoming,’’ he said.
_ “So far,” Vincent said, ‘‘I
haven’t seen much difference
between the students here and
those at Oxford, but I’ll be able
to determine that better later in
the term. They’re all dedicated
young men.”’

Vincent is teaching a seminar
class in geochemistry, and may
also “take over bits of some
classes in mineralogy,” while
he is here for the fall term.

Film Notes—

Bonnie and Clyde (WB 1967) —- The glamorized treatment of the
Depression-era bandits was a landmark in movies, blending humor
and poignancy with (then) intense violence. Warren Beatty produc-
ed and starred as Clyde Barrow with Faye Dunaway in the role that
established her as a star. An extremely enjoyable film, with ex-
cellent direction by Arthur Penn, Academy Award-winning
photography, and Flatt-Scruggs music. The wonderful supporting
cast includes Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons (hilariously shrill
and obnoxious), Michael J. Pollard, Gene Wilder, and Dub Taylor.
Presented by the SAB, Friday through Sunday, September 26-28 at
7 and 9 p.m. in duPont Auditorium. Admission is $1.

 

 

The Birth of a Nation (1915) —This Civil War epic by the legend-
ary D.W. Griffith was a milestone in movie making, and for many
years was considered the monumental achievement of cinema. It
changed the history of the medium. Lillian Gish, currently honored
ina major retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York
City, heads a ‘‘cast of thousands.’’ Shown by the Journalism Dept.,
Tuesday, September 30 at 7 and 9 p.m. No admission is charged.

 

The Washington and Lee Film Society begins its third year with
an organizational meeting on Tuesday, September 30th at 7:30 P.M.
in Classroom ‘‘3”’ of Payne Hall. The Film Society brings recent in-
ternational films of exceptional quality free of charge to the W&L
community. Anyone interested is encouraged to attend.

WLUR Announces Programs

WLUR signed on the air last
Sunday, Sept. 21, and the staff
has some special programming
planned. In addition to several
of the favorites from last year,
the basic format has been re-
worked to better meet the
preferences of the student body,
and the Lexington community.

One new weekly presentation
is the Sunday Concert Series.
This ninety-minute program
will feature un-released music
recorded live in concert. For
those who are interested in
building their tape library, this
show should be a welcome addi-
tion to the program schedule.

Afternoons at WLUR will con-
tinue to feature jazz. Afternoon
Jazz boasts both new releases
and the classics of jazz.

Classical Showcase will also
return this year. Classical
music will fill the airwaves
from 6-9:30 p.m. Sunday
through Friday.

The weeknight line-up has
also changed from last year. A
new program, Skyline, will run
from 9:30 to 11:30 p.m. Skyline
is electric music — mostly rock,

but fusion jazz will also be in-
cluded. This new show is an ex-
periment in non-commercial
electricity.

Another returning favorite is
Third Ear. Third Ear is free-
form radio ranging from elec-
tric jazz to obscure rock; from
bluegrass to electronics. There
is no standard format for Third
Ear; each disc jockey gives his
show its own flavor.

Besides musical entertain-
ment, WLUR features news,
sports and public affairs pro-
gramming. There are four
newscasts daily.

WLUR receives its state and
national news from the AP wire
service, while local news is
reported by staff reporters.
Public Affairs programming
deals with issues of both cam-
pus and local concerns.

This fall, several of the home
football games will be covered
by WLUR sports. The sports
department has also added a
new program to its line-up call-
ed SCOREBOARD. All the
day’s college and professional
scores will be covered just

before dinner on Saturday.
Special programming makes
up the remainder of this year’s
schedule. Sunday boasts Two on
the Isle, A Broadway show
tunes program. Horizons will
start off featuring a different
artist each week recorded live
at the Ljublana Jazz Festival.
The Anti-Headache Machine is
back on Saturday evening — a
show which must be listened to
for appreciation. The broadcast
day is begun with Morning
Magazine: a mixture of rock
and jazz and talk which won’t

‘ blast you out of bed in the morn-

ing. Morning Magazine is
followed by AM on FM which of-
fers something different every
day — from blues to bluegrass.

Diversity in its schedule is
what the WLUR staff strives to
accomplish. Any suggestions or
comments would be greatly ap-
preciated. WLUR stands for
Washington and Lee University
Radio — it’s your station — it
needs your support.

x JAZZ REVIEWS*

 

Swingin’
Lester

by Mark Schramm

Reviewing the recordings of
Lester Young, ‘“‘The President
of the Tenor Sax,”’ is no small
task. The knowledge that he
was one of the greatest soloists
in jazz history, that he possibly
influenced more musicians than
any other jazz figure, and that
his melodic ideas led to be-bop,
rhythm and blues, and cool jazz
make an objective appraisal of
his work difficult. One of the
most recorded of jazz artists,
Young never released a sound
that did not merit attention
(Check the Rolling Stone record
guide — all but one of his listed
albums have five stars). The
latest of his works is no excep-
tion; LESTER YOUNG IN
WASHINGTON D.C. 1956
(Pablo 2308 219) should be an in-
dispensible part of every jazz
enthusiast’s collection.

These recordings were made
during Young’s stint at Olivia
Davis’ Patio Lounge as he was
accompanied by the Bill Potts
Trio. The empathy between the
group is obvious from the out-
set, and Young swings mightily
throughout. A Foggy Day
exhibits Young’s style of com-
bining light, swinging eighth-
note passages with some hard-
nosed blowing. He treats I Can't
Get Started with delicacy and
tenderness; his note bending
and subtle tone inflections com-
bine with his underlying sense
of melancholy to make this a
highlight. Fast B-Flat Blues is a
foot-stomping jam, and D.B.
Blues cooks as Young incor-
porates 16th and 32nd note
passages into his final chorus.
Tea for Two is a surprising
ringer, possibly because Young
eschews the mushy, overblown
treatment the song often
receives and imbues it with
vitality and humor; in the mid-
dle of a strongly swinging
chorus, Young suddenly gives
out seven perfectly syncopated,
cacaphanous honks from the

(See LESTER, page 7)

 

Blythe’

Spirit
by Spencer Leffel

Arthur Blythe’s latest release
provides further evidence that
he is developing into one of the
major jazz artists of our time.
His virtuosity on the alto sax-
ophone has never been in ques-
tion. But Illusions demonstrates
that his abilities as composer
and leader are reaching an
equally lofty plateau.

Blythe actually leads two
groups on this recording. One is
a traditional quartet composed
of sax, piano, bass and drums,
The other features an unusual
instrumental lineup (a Blythe
specialty) consisting of sax,
cello, electric guitar, tuba and
drums.

This latter group creates a
most interesting sound. To
begin with, in my opinion, no
one has ever played bass lines
on tuba better than Bob
Stewart. He is very smooth, he
swings with vigor and his play-
ing exhibits none of the flab-
biness which is too often
characteristic of jazz tuba.
James ‘Blood’? Ulmer sounds
somewhat like early John
McLaughlin, but he is both
funkier and more free (kind of
like a fusion between Funka-
delic and Ornette Coleman).
His playing stands out on Bush
Baby, a tune Blythe first record-
ed several years ago with conga
and tuba accompaniment.

The new version is much
funkier thanks largely to
Ulmer, but it still retains the
African feeling of the original.
Abdul Wadud displays innova-
tive cello style which could have
a great influence on future uses
of the instrument in jazz. His
main contributions are added
color and texture, as he circles
and plays-off of Blythe’s fervent
soloing.

While he has created a very
innovative sound with this
quintet, Blythe’s best playing
on the album is with the stan-
dard quartet. He receives sym-

EC Makes Appointments,

Returns Salaries To Editors

Appointments to the Faculty
Committee were made by the
Executive Committee at its
Monday night meeting.

The E.C. appointed Winston
Burkes and Al Hintz to fill the
two positions on the Courses
and Degrees Committee.

Mike Perry and Jay Dunne
were selected for the Freshmen
Admissions Committee.

Thomas Conners was ap-
pointed to fill the position on the
Lectures Committee.

Robert Neely, Ted Fletcher,
and Jed Dunn were chosen as
the three Library Advisory
Committee members.

Two of the three positions on
the Student Health Committee
were filled by Bob Burkman
and Bob Benue. The other posi-
tion is filled by a person chosen
by the E.C.

The E.C. appointed Frank
Eppes, Mike McFadden, and
Robert Nelly as University
Athletic Committee members.

Jack Sharman was appointed
to one of the Faculty Executive
Committee positions. Student
Body Vice-President Willie
Mackie is an _ automatic
member.

There were no applications
for the two positions on the Stu-
dent Financial Aid Committee.

All E.C. appointments are
made with approval of the
President of the University.

E.C. President Bob Willis mo-
tioned that instead of these
committees waiting until the
January meeting, that there be
an earlier meeting of these
committees to ‘‘see how they
are rolling.’’ His suggestion of a
meeting for October 27 was
unanimously passed by the
board.

In addition, he motioned that
the E.C. send out letters of
thanks to those who applied to
positions on the Faculty Com-
mittee.

Peter Eliades, editor of the
Calyx, and Ring-tum Phi editor
John Billmyre questioned the
validity of last year’s E.C. deci-
sion saying that no student was
to have his or her salary paid
out of student body funds.

Until last spring, the Calyx

percent of Pub Board funds
with their business managers,
the other 55 percent going back
to the Pub Board.

Both Eliades and Billmyre
said that they were questioning
the validity of the E.C. decision,
since it came after the election
of officers by the Pub Board.
They agreed and emphasized
along with E.C. member Mar-
shall Clarke that it was the
“‘timing”’ of the decision, not the
decision itself that they were
questioning.

Eliades and Billmyre made it
clear that they agreed with last
year’s decision to curtail
editors’ salaries and that they
would just as soon see some
type of academic credit replace
the monetary reward gained
from the full-time job of run-
ning the Ring-tum Phi and the
Calyx.

As a result of their request,
the E.C. struck down last year’s
motion with a 6-3 vote.

Further discussion of the
matter will be taken up after
E.C. member Jim Vines can
make a full report on the situa-
tion.

In other business, Pryse
Elam, SAB film chairman, re-
quested approval by the E.C. to
raise the number of film com-
mittee members from 17 to 25.
He asked that two under-
graduates from each class be
added to the committee.

The E.C. granted his request.

The E.C. unanimously voted
that Not For Resale (NFR) at
Higher Price be printed on
University concert tickets so as
to avoid a recurrence of the
scalping which occurred at last
year’s ‘“‘Night Hawks” concert.

Believe It Or Not
Campus Vandalism

by Ralph Frasca

School Proctor Charles Mur-
ray believes that two incidents
of vandalism, one in the men’s
locker room of Doremus Gym-
nasium late Thursday night and
another in the Law School
lounge early Sunday morning,
may have been perpetrated by
the same individual, although
he discounts student involve-
ment.

“We do not feel that a
member of the student body
would have committed these
acts, as there is no apparent
motive which would lead us to
believe otherwise.’’

The defacing of numerous
lounge chairs and tables in the
Law School, and the destruction
of various sports equipment
items belonging to several
faculty members, notably Dean
Atwood and Professor Smith,
carries the same modus operan-
di — lengthy slash marks from

a sharp knife’ were
characteristic of each.
However, there were two

distinct incidents of theft which
also occurred last week.
Someone apparently used a
master key to steal approx-
imately $525 in checks and $300
to $350 in cash from the

Registrar Head's office last
Wednesday night.
“We believe it was an

amateur, because a_profes-
sional would not have bothered
to steal checks, which are of no
use to the thief,’’ Murray said.
He went on to say that there are
numerous individuals who
possess master keys to the
Registrar’s office, including the
secretaries, carpenters, electri-
cians, plumbers, and many key
University personnel — some
forty people in all.

Registrar Head suspects that
it may have been someone with
knowledge of the working of the
Registrar’s office. ‘‘We normal-
ly don’t have money in the of-
fice, but last week we happened
to, unfortunately. The thief
must have known that we had
money, and must have known
where to find it,’ Head
postulated.

The fourth incident occurred
last weekend. As with the
Registrar theft, someone utiliz-
ed a master key to enter the
maintenance building and stole
five rolls of wallpaper and one
box of wallpaper paste, valued
at $130. Murray does not think
that the two “master-key”
thefts were related.

 
 

Jazz Review ‘Illusions’

(continued from page 5)
pathetic and-inspired support
from John Hicks on piano, Fred
Hopkins on bass and Steve Mc-
Call on drums...The band’s
sound is seamless; the musi-
cians sound as if they have been
playing together for years,
rather than just one recording
date.

Sparks fly on 4s of Yet, a
hard-bop tune which swings
ruthlessly. Hicks and Blythe
deliver the two hottest solos of
the album on this cut. And
Hopkins and McCall, best

known for their work with the
avant-garde group Air, explode
the myth that free players can’t
swing. Another outstanding per-
formance by the quartet is My
Son Ra, which is as mellow as 4s
of Yet is hot, without losing any
emotional impact. Blythe opens
‘ine song ‘by soloing over a
meterless drone which is
reminiscent of middle-period
Coltrane. The group then swit-
ches into a sweet ballad in 7/4
time.

Blythe has managed to pro-

bottom register of his horn — it
is irresistable.

The accompanying group is
superb throughout, the piano of
Bill Potts being a particular
delight. Perhaps the success of
this album is due to, the sen-
sitivity between the musicians;
Potts quickly adapts to Young’s
ideas, and bassist Willie
Williams complements _ both
well. Drummer Jim Lucht
plays with a firm steadiness,
and he kicks home the up-tempo
numbers with a_ powerfully
stomping bass drum. The
cumulative effect is that Young
is obviously in comfortable sur-
roundings, and this leads to
some of his finest soloing of the
50s, comparable even to the
remarkable sessions of that
period with Oscar Peterson and

It has become fashionable in
some quarters to suggest that
Lester Young’s post WWII work
pales in comparison to his work
with Count Basie and others in
an earlier period. Certainly it
can be said that the racial
harassment and incarceration
for possession of marijuana
Young received while in service
scarred him, and his post-war
sound WAS different. Yet, in the
melancholy and romantic tone

he affected, Young’s genius
shines through just as brightly,
and his swing is no less power-
ful. Perhaps the value of
LESTER YOUNG IN
WASHINGTON D.C. 1956 is that
it will silence the critics of this
man who shaped and influenced
the future of jazz music more
than any other artist. Lester
Young was rightfully called
“The Pres’; this album is a
powerful reminder of that.

duce an album which has a
chance to be moderately
popular without sacrificing
musical quality. As Blythe says
in the liner notes, ‘‘(The music)
should be accessible to each
listener on a thematic level, but
still maintain a consistence of
not being repetitive.’’ Arthur
Blythe is far too creative to ever
become repetitive. And his
Illusions will hopefully enjoy
some commercial success, for
it is one of the best jazz albums
of the year.

Stereo

Stolen

A student who parked his
truck in the freshman parking
lot discovered Monday that so-

meone broke into _ his
automobile and stole $800 of car
stereo equipment.

George Weatherly says he
knows he locked his Suburban
truck up, and was dismayed to
find his car stereo equipment
missing.

Missing from Weatherly’s
truck are a Pioneer AM-FM
cassette deck, a 120 watt power
amp and a pair of two-way
speakers.

“The thief had to take a lot of
time, the amp was concealed,”’
said Weatherly.

Report’s recommendation of
Plan C. Briscoe does not believe
that the majority of fraternity
houses need major renovation
and “‘the problem of structural
damage is as great across the
board.’”’ “‘It’s not completely
our fault, buildings, especially
fraternity houses, don’t last
forever,’’ said Briscoe.

Briscoe sees the Report as an
important signal from the
University, ‘‘the University is
fed up, we’ve been lax in our
financial responsibilities and
wasted money lent to us’’ but
Briscoe insists he sees ‘“‘a
changing trend.”’

Briscoe believes the key to
the survival of W&L’s fraternity
system as it is lies in ‘better
management in each house’”’
and a more responsible attitude
toward their Lexington
neighbors.

“It’s definitely a sink or swim
situation for fraternities, but
I’m convinced that if we show
the proper efforts, the Universi-
ty will help us,”’ Briscoe said.

Soccer Team Hands

MWC 2-0 Setback

by Mark Schramm

If Head Soccer Coach Rolf
Piranian was concerned about
the lack of offensive punch ex-
hibited by his front line.during
three consecutive pre-season
losses, in which his troops were
held scoreless, it didn’t show.

“The other teams had more
practice than we did,” Piranian
explained ‘‘We’ve had less than
a week to prepare for these
games and the men up front are
still feeling each other out.
They'll get it together by the
time the season rolls around.”

The coach’s words proved
prophetic as the Generals total-
ly dominated a strong Mary
Washington team by scoring a

convincing 2-0 victory ina game
that was not as close as the
score indicated.

Midfielder Bryan Williams,
who has shed all doubts about
his ability to return from a pre-
season ankle injury, opened the
scoring in the 14th minute of
play. After intercepting a
wayward pass, the MVP for the
past two years dribbled down
the left side, faked past two
defenders and unleashed a shot
from 35 yards out that ripped in-
to the back of the net.

Williams’ goal fired up his
already enthusiastic team-
mates, only five of whom are
seniors. ‘‘We do have a young

Read it again: 28-14.

What looks like a simple
mathematical phrase must
carry a special meaning for
anyone associated with
Washington and Lee football.
You see, the Generals won last
Saturday, 28-14.

That’s right, 28-14.

Now for some teams, 28
points in four quarters of foot-
ball is no big deal. Teams like
Oklahoma, Alabama or Ohio
State could probably amass the

same total in their sleep. But .

those are Division I teams —the
cream of the crop.

At Washington and Lee, a
Division III football team
somewhere in the mountains of
Virginia, 28 points seems like a
blessing from heaven. That’s
why Saturday was such a big
deal. While rolling to their se-
cond win in their first three
games (which is another story

{4 Generals Dump Wasps As

Cavalline Runs For 149

by Dale Park

For the first time in its last
seven meetings against the
Emory & Henry Wasps, the
Washington and Lee varsity
football team came away win-
ners with a convincing 28-14 vic-
tory.

The win lifted the Generals to
a 2-1 record, their best start
since 1973.

‘The offense is really beginn-
ing to gel,” said head coach
Gary Fallon. ‘‘We used Chris
Cavalline (sophomore tailback)
effectively, but when E&H look-
ed for him we were able to
counter with Jim Wenke (junior
quarterback) running the ball.”’

Cavalline and Wenke combin-
ed for 222 of the Generals’ 253
yards on the ground. Cavalline
rushed for 149 yards on 35 car-
ries, while Wenke picked up 72
yards on 15 attempts.

In addition, Wenke contri-
buted 68 more yards through
the air, including a crucial 33
yarder to junior tight end Mike
Fogarty. The pass set up a W&L
touchdown dive by Cavalline
late in the second quarter.

Both offensively and defen-
sively, the first three quarters
belonged to the Generals.
W&L’s first possession of the
game turned into a sixty yard
drive that took eight minutes
and fourteen plays and was cap-
ped by a one-yard Wenke touch-
down run,

Two possessions later the
Generals made it 14-0 as
Cavalline dove into the endzone
to ice a long, second quarter
drive,

“Yet,” said Fallon, “the un-
sung hero of the day was Lee
Minetree (senior fullback).

‘All afternoon Lee threw the
crucial blocks that sprung
Cavalline.’’

Rich Hachenburg (junior
quarterback) entered the game
to replace Wenke only minutes
into the second half. Explained
Fallon: ‘I want to keep both
Hachenburg and Wenke sharp,
and by putting Rich into the
game and keeping the pressure
on him, I know I have him later
if I need him.”

fourth quarter by _ sending
Cavalline over the top for his
third touchdown plunge of the
day.

While the offense remained
consistent, several lapses in the
Generals’ pass defense allowed
the Wasps completions, leading
to two fourth quarter Emory &
Henry touchdowns.

‘They are a good bunch of hit-
ters,’ said Fallon, ‘‘yet
sometimes they get so keyed up
that they tend to go after the
man rather than the ball.”

The Wasps gained 195 yards
through the air, compared to
the Generals’ 93.

Pass defense will be a big con-
cern of the Generals as they
take on Centre College away
next Saturday. Commented
Fallon: ‘Centre has a big, 6’3’’
quarterback who can throw the
ball and throws a lot. They also
have a good defense and will be
very tough on their home field.”’

Last year W&L shocked the
Colonels in Lexington by the
score of 14-10.

Generals Dunk Hopkins
In Water Polo Opener

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
successfully opened its 1980
season Sunday with an 18-9 vic-
tory over Johns Hopkins. The
home opener provided an ex-
citing offensive show for the few
spectators able to arouse
themselves for Sunday morning
action.

Johns. Hopkins opened the
scoring in the first minute of the
game with a quick, fast-break
goal. Hopkins immediately
followed up with another score
which put the Blue Jays in the
lead, 2-0, after only 1:27 of the
game.

W&L called for a time out in
order for coach Page Remillard
to make some timely comments
on his team’s defensive play

Preview:

and the Generals came back
with three quick goals to take
the lead. The first period ended
with W&L up by a score of 5-3.

After the big'scare of the first
quarter, the Generals settled
down and began to dominate the
game. Working with a fast pac-
ed offense and strong shooting,
W&L built an almost insur-
mountable lead by the time the
second half got underway.

The third period opened with
another temporary defensive
lapse as Hopkins once again
scored two quick goals, but the
Generals soon regained their
form and rapidly put the game
out of reach.

W&L’s scoring was very
balanced, with team captain
Mike Bernot on top with five

goals. He was followed closely
by two-freshmen, Don ‘“‘Shark”’
Smith and Rand McClain, with
four and three goals, respec-
tively. Also having good offen-
sive days were Bob Marshall
and Tim Rock, each scoring
twice on two attempts.

Coach Remillard was pleased
with his team’s play, but had
important reservations. The
defensive play was spotty and
at times the Generals seemed to
grow complacent and rely sole-
ly on their offense.

Remillard was disappointed
in the defensive play and feels
that a much stronger effort will
be necessary in subsequent
games.

This year’s team does show
great promise, however. There

Cross-Country Team Looks Balanced

by John Harrison

Balance, a_ characteristic
which past teams have sorely
lacked, will be the strongest
asset of the. 1980 Washington
and Lee cross country team.

Whereas in past seasons
Coach Dick Miller has had to re-
ly heavily on one or two run-
ners, this year’s team will pro-
bably not have any members
that stand out. Instead, about
half of its fourteen members ap-
pear to be capable of giving bet-
ter than average performances
each and every week.

As Coach Miller puts’ it,
“From what I have seen in
practice, I’d say there are about
six guys I can count on to do
fairly well. I have been par-
ticularly impressed by three
freshmen. There is a balance on
this team that I haven’t had in
quite a few years.”

   

Co-Captains Howard Herndon
and Charles Warner are the on-
ly returning seniors on the
squad. Other returning up-
perclassmen are sophomores
David Dallam, Ted Fletcher,
Howard Gill, Jonathan Helfant,
William Langhorne, Mark
Smith, Todd Smith and junior
Greg Branan. Rounding out the
team are freshmen Bill Benson,
Chris Coigne, Lars Keeley, and
Angus McBryde.

The season will open this
Saturday, September 27, in
Fredericksburg. Mary Wash-
ington will be hosting the
Generals, as -well as
Washington College and Divi-
sion I George Washington.

Coach Miller is reluctant to
make any predictions. His only
comment is that this is just the
third year that Mary Washing-

Fall Tennis Program
Opens In Annapolis

by Phil Murray

Washington and Lee opens its
1980 Fall Tennis program this
weekend at the sixth annual
Navy Invitational.

The tournament should be a
good test for the 1980-81 team
which must fill the gaps left by
the graduation of three four-
year lettermen: Co-Captains
Stewart Jackson and David
Constine and top doubles player
Pat Norris.

Coach Gary Franke remains
optimistic about this year’s
team which includes four let-
termen with varsity singles ex-
perience. Leading the Generals
are senior Co-Captains Petes
Lovell and Doug Gaker.

Lovell played in two and three
positions last year, finishing
with a 6-12 record, only one win
shy of the team’s 7-12 mark in
1980. Gaker, playing in the
number five slot, had a fine 9-8
record,

In addition, Lovell
distinguished himself in the
ODAC tournament with a Ist
place in the number two spot.

Sophomore Steve Denny
returns to the squad this year
after a solid performance of 10-8
in the sixth position last year.
Rounding out the top four is
junior Wes Younge.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Time For Action

During the past week the Washington and Lee Com-
munity has witnessed several disturbing acts of
violence. More than a few people have been attacked
and Lexington Police are investigating what could be
the town’s first rape in over a decade. We have
already seen that it is not safe to walk the streets
alone past midnight, but there have been incidents
where fairly large groups were attacked. One has to
wonder if Lexington is receiving the type and amount
of protection it seems to need.

Upperclassmen cannot help but remember and con-
trast the events of the past week with the quiet Lex-
ington they first encountered a few short years ago.
For many the charm of historic Lexington may have
been a factor in the decision to move to Lexington or
go to W&L The futures of Lexington and W&L are
intertwined. We should all be concerned about any
crime or violence in Lexington.

Yet students can find little solace in the knowledge
that local police seem more concerned with issuing
parking tickets and noise ordinance violations than
dealing with actual crime. The same night on which a
freshman was brutally assualted, the police issued
three noise ordinance summons and a variety of war-
nings. On the same night police found a visitor to Lex-
ington unconscious, with an eight-inch gash on his
head. He had been beaten up. Yes, there were several
incidents, and the police did not see one of thein.

Do we have to wait for violence to hit someone on
city council before we see the police spend some time
and effort preventing real crime and less on minor
matters such as parking tickets? We certainly hope
not. The W&L community should offer its cooperation
in hope that the local police will mount an effective
campaign to stop violence before it starts.

Ticket him... he‘s expired

by Jed Dunn

It seems that in this new academic season, the
Virginia Commonwealth authorities continue to
enforce two separate policies of ‘‘justice’’ — one
for local residents and another for college stu-
dents. Selective enforcement of both traffic laws
and alcoholic beverage laws was evident this past
weekend. For example, undercover plainclothes
control officers harassed students for consuming
beer in the back seat of a parked car while local
residents openly drank beer and shouted obscen-
ities from the top of the Robert E. Lee Hotel porch.
Are we to believe that only Washington and Lee
students are susceptible to intoxication? Or liable
under the law? Doubtless many of you have seen
disgusting winos hanging out on the streets but let
one W&L student drink a beer in sight of the road
and what happens?

Further — this small town of Lexington should
be safe enough to stroll about in at night without
fear of being hurt. But again the Lexington police
seem to enforce a double standard policy. While
W&L students are sometimes arrested for walking
down the street at night (it really happened), rov-
ing bands of local youth rampage unchecked, liter-

ally terrorizing students and their dates. It is un-
safe to walk from the campus at night because of
these street gangs. The disturbing fact is that
these gangs have repeatedly mugged W&L stu-
dents over the past two years and the Lexington
police have taken no visible action to protect
responsible citizens. On any night can be found
clusters of these youth strategically hanging out
on Main Street and the Nelson Street Bridge, un-
questioned by police officers — but let a house
stereo play past midnight and what happens?
Notice please the summoning of three fraternity
presidents this weekend for nebulous “‘noise’’ vio-
lations while one student was violently beaten up
just fifty yards from one of those same fraternity
houses.

Students in Lexington have had enough of the
double standard. The time has come for fair and
equitable enforcement of the law. Protection from
the marauding youths must be demanded of the
Lexington police. No longer should these unsuper-
vised delinquents terrorize any citizen who wishes
to walk at night. Perhaps W&L and the Lexington
police can work together so that a safe environ-
ment can exist. But first, consistent enforcement
of the law must be a reality.

Stop Sending Trash!

pear W&L Students,

 

 

Even if I didn’t know what
time of year it is, I can tell you
are back in town and starting
classes again. Your presence is
apparent by litter everywhere
— paper cups, empty beer cans,
smashed bottles, discarded six-
pack containers.

First thing I had to do Satur-

day morning (September 13th)
was Clean up the debris that had
been dropped in front of and
around our office building.

I do think it would be most fit-
ting if a city “nuisance” tax
was levied upon each of you to
help finance the retrieval of lit-
ter which accompanies you.

Criticism Of Frat Maintenance Plans

Dear Editor:

We would like to voice our ob-
jections to the University’s new
maintenance plan for frater-
nities. From what we’ve heard
of this program, it seems to be
ill considered and hastily im-
plemented.

First of all, the committee
which recommended this action
included only one fraternity
member. We fail to see how one
member of a single fraternity
can possibly speak for the sixty
percent of the student body
which belong to one of seven-
teen fraternities.

Secondly, we do not under-
stand why the program was im-

plemented last summer before
most students, alumni, and
faculty members knew about it.
It seems that the administra-
tion did not see any reason to
give these vital members of the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty a chance to respond while the
program was in the planning
stages.

Finally, we cannot see any
reason for the administration to
give the I.F.C. member the
dead option of accepting the
program or losing recognition

of his fraternity by the Univer-
sity. If the administration has
the legal power to force this pro-
gram on the fraternities, it
should be done openly. To put
the program under the charade
of student self-government
poses a danger to what little we
have left.

We hope that some member
of the administration can
publicly clear up these objec-
tions so that we all may rest a
little easier.

Spectator At Sea (on the fraternal slaver)

By official decree of His Royal Highness, The Golden Ale lies in
port for extensive overhauls. Once the pride of the royal yachting
flotilla, this fine ship has been severely punished by the Inner Fleet
Council. For ’tis only three days before the west winds pick up, and
the fleet rushes off in search of young savages and new slaves. The
Golden Ale is beaten; she will miss the winds. The great Greek
himself could not accomplish the list of labors that awaits her
motley crew. Yet I spy a flurry of activity aboard, and the cry, “all
hands on deck”’ rings out. Great gators alive, there’s the bastard
Captain High.

—This ship doesn’t look too bad, now, does it, Matey? Our stately
white masts may be cracking and listing alee, our hull may be cav-
ing in some, but sure as snow in Columbia, we shall cast off in time
for the slave rush. Slap a little plaster around here, and she’ll look
as good as new.

—Aye, aye, sir.

—Get on with it then, you lazy scad, you good-for-nothing
sophomore. Hand me that bottle, too, or I'll have you drawn and
postered all over the Seminary. Where are the bootblacks,
anyway?

—Yah call’d, mastah, sah?

—On your knees when you approach, foul pledge; where are your |

manners, your pride, your sense of Fraternal tradition? Vile Ebony
— I loath the sight of your kind. Away before you spoil the sweet
aroma of my bourbon nectar. Hi-hu — what have we here? A royal
messenger...good tidings or bad?

—I fear they are bad, Captain High, sir. The King’s Inter Fleet
Council has instructed me to inform you of a 2,800 drachma tax to
be levied immediately ‘‘on all yachts and pleasure boats in need of
small repair and for which said tax will be ruinous.”’

Meddlers. We shall fight, fight, fight! Never in all my drunken days
has my buzz been so heavy, my high so low. My sojourn to Ber-
muda, my grain parches, the slave rush all lost in one foul blow.
Call the accountant, call my broker, swab the decks. Oh mommy,
mommy dearest...I fear I shall faint.

Later, in his oak panelled study, Captain High listens to the
trusted council of his social chairman first-class, one Jack Black
Daniels.

—Aye, sir, take a hit off this here, and ponder this if you will. We
have full fodder: four hundred stone of hog, seventy-seven barrels
of ale, nine coils of hemp, a ton of munchies, and one soul tape. We
could set sail tomorrow and snare all the virgins in Amazon. Witha
little luck, the right wind, and a little dancing, you'll have a fine
rush, sir. I predict twenty new slaves before the first, or may I live
to join them on Hell Night.

—Small comfort, gentle Jack. What of the repairs, the decree, the
odious tax? We will founder, surely. Yet you give me courage,
hope. Let us pray for foul weather and great snows to strand the
fleet and deplete their coffers. Ah, here cometh the ship manager,
perhaps he’ll bring us new cheer. What news of the labors, Junior
Joint?

—The holes are patched, the masts aright, and the hull glistens
with fresh paint. Yet I fear the plumbing, sir. The head is overflow-
ing and the cook complains of it. The lower decks are flooded, too,
so I’ve boarded all up. The crew grumbles when they hang-ten to
the sea, but take no notice. The Royal Council enjoyed the musty
odor. The decree is lifted!

—Great omens! Great Greeks! Set the sails! Fire the bongs!
Raise the bottle! Raise the anchor, AHOY...full speed ahead (to be
continued).

Latest Win Was Two-Man Show

(continued from page 8)
other times in the last six years

In gaining win number two,
the Generals unleashed two new
stars to the gridiron. While their
names are familiar to anyone
who has followed this team the
last two years, the exploits of
Jim Wenke and Chris Cavalline
have seldom been as apparent
as they were last Saturday.

Running the offense was
Wenke, one of the three men on
last year’s quarterback roller-
coaster and one of the two men
embroiled in this year’s
quarterback enigma. For the
moment, Jim Wenke appears to
be the definitive quarterback.
All he did was run for 72 yards
(averaging almost five yards a
carry), pass for 68 yards (con-
necting on 55 percent of his
throws), and directed his team
to 21 first-half points.

Playing basically half of the
game, Wenke was able to pro-
duce over 250 yards of offense.
That adds up to somewhere
near 500 yards for the entire
game.

But don’t get the impression
that Wenke was the only factor
in the win. Take away the per-
formance of the Generals’ new
tailback, Chris Cavalline, and
W&L would have been without

to roll out, Cavalline usually
ended up busting through the

Generals’ defense swarms over Emory & Henry’s backs.

Best Start Since I 963

 

Generals Win Again

by Dale Park

Off to a 3-1 start for the first
time since 1963, the Washington
and Lee varsity football team
made it two in a row last Satur-
day by handing Centre College
a 16-9 defeat on the Colonels’
home field.

“It seems that all our hard
work is beginning to pay off,”
said Head Coach Gary Fallon.

Although Centre struck first
on a one-yard scoring play in
the second quarter, the W&L
special-team unit blocked the
point after attempt. Sophomore
tailback Chris Cavalline’s one-
yard touchdown plunge late in
the same quarter and Bill
Devine’s successful extra-point

 

attempt gave the Generals a 7-6

lead.

Executive Committee,

Publications Board Clash

by Cope Moyers

The, Executive Committee
and the Publications Board
clashed Monday night on the
question of whether editors and
business managers of Universi-
ty publications should receive
salaries.

Publication Board President
Channing Hall reported that the
board voted unanimously last
January to pay the editors of
the Ring-tum Phi and Calyx a
salary of 22.5 percent of the
publication’s profits. Business
managers of both publications
were given $150 a year plus 25

percent of the profits.

But members of the Ex-
ecutive Committee questioned
the board’s authority in grant-
ing salaries.

“Article seven, section C (of
the Student Body Constitution),
states that members of the
Publication Board cannot vote
on salaries,” Willie Mackie
said,

Hall said he believed last
January’s vote by the Publica-
tions Board was actually an

for non-fraternity members.
The official statement of the
Board reads, ‘‘It is the opinion
of the SAB that holding Fancy
Dress on Friday night would be
in the best interests of the Stu-

.dent Body, putting entertain-

ment in the Cockpit on Saturday
night would also complete the
Independents’ weekend.”’

The vote wrapped up two
weeks of discussion on the pros
and cons of holding the dance on
either Friday or Saturday

amendment to the board’s con-
stitution.

There could be trouble, how-
ever, determining whether last
year’s vote is actually an
amendment because the
amended constitution is lost and
cannot be located.

“I don’t know if it’s deter-
minable whether it’s an amend-
ment if we can’t find the con-
stitution,’ Hall added.

Hall invited the Executive
Committee to a Publications
Board meeting at 7 pm next
Tuesday in the Calyx office to

‘further discuss the issues. The

student body is also allowed to
attend the meeting.

As the EC meeting progress-
ed, the salary dispute became
less. of an issue between the Ex-
ecutive Committee and
Publications Board. Instead,
the argument centered on the
relationship between the two
organizations.

EC member Jeff Edwards
said it was extremely important

IFC To Examine Fraternity Report

by Mike Perry

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Monte Briscoe urged
fraternity presidents and
representatives to gather feed-
back from fraternity members
on the report recently released
by the Ad Hoc Committee on
Fraternities.

Briscoe termed the report a
“question of survival for frater-
nities’ and encouraged the
fraternity representatives to
report back to the IFC at its
next meeting. Briscoe sug-
gested that such a discussion by

the IFC could lay the ground-
work for an “open campus
forum,” involving faculty,
students and administration of-
ficials, to be sponsored by the
IFC and possibly held in Lee
Chapel.

In other business Briscoe
reiterated the concern of Lex-
ington community members
over the large amount of litter
found in the city’s streets on
weekend mornings following
fraternity evening activities.
Briscoe also suggested that
frtaternities gather com-
parative data on their respec-

tive food services in hope of
eliminating over-spending and
facilitating use of the programs
offered by University Food Ser-
vices Director Jerry Darrell.

The IFC Juducial Board fined
Sigma Chi $150 for a violation of
the IFC’s no-contact rules. In
what Briscoe termed a
‘flagrant violation,” the board
ruled that visits made by a
Sigma Chi sophomore to a
transfer student living in the
Lee House during periods other
than “‘dorm rush” were a viola-
tion of the IFC rush regulation.

ly has over the board.

“‘We may not even have the
power to regulate their
salaries,” said Edwards.

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Willis added that he
was not even sure if the
Publications Board was a
standing committee of the EC.

Willis also said it was
necessary for the Executive
Committee to give the Publica-
tions Board some _indepen-
dence.

“It’s important to keep the
Pub Board autonomous from
the EC,’ he said.

Hall said the issues involved
will require further research
and could take several weeks
before they are resolved.

“Some time needs to be
taken,” said Hall.

In other business, the Ex-
ecutive Committee agreed to
suggest to the Courses and
Degrees Committee that there
be an overhaul of the pass/fail
procedure.

“I think the pass/fail pro-
cedure is really screwed up,”
Willis said.

Willis outlined his ideas for a
re-vamping of the procedure,
stressing the anonymity of
those students enrolled in
pass/fail courses.

He said the names of those
taking a course pass/fail should
not be posted on the colonade or
known to the professor.

Willis also described a

Class Of 84 Boasts Strong Credentials

by Charlie Thompson

According to statistics, the
class of 1984 appears to be bet-
ter qualified than its recent
predecessors. The number of
applicants jumped to 1413, of
which 770 students were ac-
cepted. Of these, 349 or 45.3 per-
cent chose to enroll at W&L.
This confirmation is down about
10 percent from recent years
(78—56 percent). According to
Mr. Van M. Pate, Associate
Director of Admissions, W&L
was competing in a ‘‘faster
track” last year, and the pool of
applicants simply had more op-
tions than in previous years.

The majority of this year’s
freshman class comes from
public high schools (59 percent)
and this is also somewhat dif-
ferent than in past years.
Throughout the 70’s, public and
private schools were repre-
sented almost evenly at
Washington and Lee. Similarly,
60 percent of the public school
students received admission,
while 49 percent of the private
school applicants were admit-

ted. Apparently this is due to
the fact that more self-
screening occurs in_ public
schools. Thus, the bulk of public
school applicants are ranked in
the top fifth of their class,
leading to the higher accep-
tance rate.

Demographically, Virginia
still leads the roll call with 74
students, followed by Texas
represented by 34. The other
states in double figures are
New York (28), Maryland (26),
New Jersey (21), Florida (19),
Pennsylvania (16); North
Carolina (15), Connecticut (12),
Georgia (12), and Tennessee
(12). Texas has the biggest in-
crease in numbers primarily
because of strong alumni con-
tacts and several schools sen-
ding clusters of students — the
St. Mark’s of Dallas School has
8 members in the freshman
class this year.

Sons of alumni submitted 74
applications of which 61 were
accepted, a noticeably higher
rate of 82.4 percent. Other ap-
plicants had an acceptance rate

of 52.2 percent. Mr. Pate admits
that alumni sons face less com-
petition for admission, and in
these cases the admissions of-
fice looks for indications of
“survivability.’’ In other words,
if the applicant would appear to
be able to make it through 4
years here, he will be readily
admitted.

Academically, more than half
of the entering freshmen were
ranked in the top fifth of their
classes; and the mean SAT
scores jumped to 1160 from a
reasonably level plateau of
about 1120 over the last 5 years.
In addition, there are 16
valedictorians and 12 National
Merit Scholarship finalists this
year, notable increases over the
past.

Whether this upsurge in ad-
missions statistics will continue
remains to be seen, but accord-
ing to Mr. Pate; inquiries con-
cerning admissions applica-
tions and information is up by
some 2,000 over the comparable
figures last year.

Theft Suspect Arrested

 

Rape Was Attempted

by J. R. Smith

Results from a rape test per-

Freshman
Caught
Streaking

A Washington and Lee
freshman was convicted in
Buena Vista Circuit Court
Thursday for his part in a
streaking incident at Southern
Seminary Junior College.

Sylvester Miniter, 18, had
been charged with public dis-
play, but pleaded guilty to a
reduced charge of streaking. He
was fined $50.

Miniter was arrested Sept. 15
at 9 p.m., when Buena Vista
police spotted him and another
person streaking on the Sem
campus. The other nude runner
was not caught.

Miniter said the incident was
prompted by a $40 debt, which
he could pay for by streaking.

An arrest has been made in
connection with the reported
theft of a car stereo system
belonging to a Washington and
Lee student.

Charles Russell Smith Jr., 19,
was arrested at 12:15 PM on
Monday and charged with
grand larceny in the theft of an
AM/FM stereo cassette player
valued at $870. Smith is an
employee of Washington and
Lee University.

The theft was reported by
George H. Weatherly Jr., a
W&L freshman, who stated that
the stereo was stolen from his
car parked in the lot on
McLaughlin Street. The report
was filed September 22.

According to the police, addi-
tional charges are pending in
the case. Smith is being held in
Rockbridge Jail on a $3,000
bond.

Two Virginia Military In-
stitute students were arrested

raised $13.5 million against that
goal. In an earlier phase ended
in 1976 of its decade-long
development program, W&L
raised $1.5 million beyond a $36-
million goal.

Sessoms is a 1956 B.A. grad-
uate of Hampden-Sydney Col-
lege who lived in Lexington
previously for three years when
he was sports information
director and athletic business
manager at Virginia Military
Institute. He left those positions
in 1963 to join Williamsburg,
where he was successively a
press bureau staff writer and
manager of broadcast services,
then assistant director of public
relations, and later director of
special events.

He is a former president of
Virginia’s chapter of the Public
Relations Society of America, a
former member of the
Williamsburg-James City Coun-
ty School Board; and a member
of the board of directors of the
Lynchburg Historical Founda-

The VFIC, of which he is now
associate director, is a fund-
raising consortium of 12 four-
year private liberal-arts col-
leges. In the year just ended, it
raised a record $2,1 million
from more than 1,000 con-
tributors, principally  busi-
nesses and industries with
Virginia operations, represen-
ting a 28 percent increase over
the previous year’s totals. The

Earl McClanahan, class of ’82, hangs above the Maury River dur-

ing a recent ROTC mountaineering event.

ROTC On The Rocks

On Friday, September 26th,
fifty-seven Washington and Lee

- students and their guests re-

bounded down the VMI cliffs
overlooking the Maury River.
This was hardly a demonstra-
tion of lemming-like mass
suicide nor was it an elaborate
fraternity initiation.

Instead, it was an afternoon
of rappelling, sponsored by the
University’s Military Science
Department. This skill involves
alpine techniques used to scale
and descend cliff faces. Impor-
tance is placed upon secure
knots, rigging, and iron-clad
safety procedures. Many of the
cadets and their guests hurtled
down the rock face with calcu-
lated abandon, while others —
less certain of their moun-
taineering prowess — chose to
make a somewhat more ginger-
ly descent.

A number of the volunteer
mountaineers expressed real
astonishment both that they had
accomplished the seemingly
scary feat as easily as they did,

and that they had enjoyed such
safety in the rappelling.

“Wow, I can’t believe I ac-
tually went through with it!”’
commented Mrs. Debbie Lane
of Lexington, after completing
a surprisingly professional first
descent.

Some cadets in the program,
such as John Fox, class of ’81,
stressed the usefulness of such
training and its application to a
variety of military skills.

‘ccwenenuienanenes
by Will Jackson

The precedent established by
Washington and Lee’s year-old
undergraduate library has been
fulfilled in the completion of its
“new’’ commerce building.

McCormick Hall, W&L’s
library from 1906 to 1979, now
houses the school of Commerce,
Economics and Politics. While
maintaining its time-honored,
columned exterior, McCormick
is virtually a new building in-
side, a model of thoughtful and

efficient renovation.

Almost.

‘Basically we’re very pleas-
ed with the facility,”’ says Dean
Edward C. Atwood, ‘‘but there
are still a few problems.’’ These
problems include delays in the
receipt of some of the building’s
furnishings — tables, desks and
carrels. But, according to Dean
Atwood, ‘“‘the most frustrating
lack

 

i

Workmes add finishing touches to a Commerce School driveway.

is the lack of black-

boards.”

This lack has been noticed in
many cases as professors fight
over the few available portable
blackboards.

The success of the renovation,
Dean Atwood says, “‘is amazing
when you stop to think this was
the library, I don’t think you’ll
find anyone coming into the
building and saying ‘Oh, this is
obviously a conversion.’ ”’

Throughout, the building was
planned with an eye to conven-

 

ience, efficiency and versatili-
ty, as well as preservation of
the building’s original char-
acter. Elaborate woodwork and
mouldings were preserved
wherever possible. All original
windows were retained for

‘natural lighting.

Two spacious auditorium/-
classrooms and an electrical
equipment room command the
building’s central section,

 

  
  

which formerly housed five low-
ceilinged levels of library
stacks. Around this core are
ranged offices, classrooms,

study rooms, a reading room,
and_ student
lounges.
Altogether, the C-school has
three times as much room in
McCormick than in Newcomb

‘Disciple’ Opens This Month

by Markham §S. Pyle

The Irish are coming! Specifically, the late Irish
playwright George Bernard Shaw, whose satire on
life during the American Revolution, The Devil’s
Disciple, opens at the Troubador Theatre October
24th.

Unlike most of Shaw’s plays, which tend to be
staged lectures — rather like Politics 101 at lesser
universities, The Devil’s Disciple is an old-style
melodrama in which Evil gets its Just Desserts,
Good Triumphs, and Young Love Conquers All.
Only Shaw could use these hoary cliches to com-
ment on the nature of Justice and the character of
Revolution. Best of all, the play is witty, fun, and
(a rarity) a vehicle to let us laugh at ourselves.

Director Robert Mogavero quotes Shaw as
labeling the author’s role as ‘‘ ‘sugar-coating. You
make a comment on a social issue and then you
must cover it in comedy so you may present it to
the audience.’ ’’ Mogavero should know: he’s been
guest artist at W&L, Duke, NYU, and the
American Academy of Dramatic Arts. This, mind

you, in addition to his work in Actor’s Equity’s
Equity Library Theatre in New York, The Circle
Off-Broadway, and various upstate New York
summer stock companies. He has surrounded
himself with a professional staff, and is determin-
ed to present Shaw, warts and all. The cast is
drawn from the W&L/Rockbridge Community,
and includes Rick Kukucka as Richard Dudgeon;
Carla Dillon as Mrs. Annie Dudgeon, and Al Gor-
don as British General “Gentleman Johnny”
Burgoyne.

Robert Mogavero’s reasons for staging Disciple
are flattering: in addition to his delight in the pro-
fessionalism of the W&L Drama Department, and
the cast and crew of the play, he feels that Disciple
is especially appropriate to Lexington, where, he
says, “history is still alive.’ In addition,
Mogavero finds this ‘‘encomium to the American
Revolution” freshly applicable in this election
year.

The celebration begins Friday, October 24th.

What the Hell’s a Ring-tum Phi?

___—— Film Notes

Back in the days wnen tele-
phones (all 68 of them in Lex-
ington, an advertisement
boasted) were known as ‘“‘up-to-
date electric call bells,” back
when stealing a_bell-clapper
was called “a naughty-one’s
frolic,” in the same year that
the New York Post conferred on
this city (really) the title
‘Athens of the South” — there
came into being a little
newspaper published weekly,
“by the students for the
Washington and Lee University
community,” and named after
the most popular of that Univer-
sity’s football cheers: ‘‘Ring-
tum Phi.”

“Coincident with the ad-
ministration of President
Wilson begins the career of a
new publication at Washington
and Lee, the Ring-tum Phi. The
Ring-tum Phi is a weekly jour-
nal and presents a pleasing ap-
pearance. It meets a distinct
need in the University and

relieves the Collegian of what
formerly has tended only to clog
and retard.”
Literary Magazine
“The Collegian is primarily a
literary magazine, and when

 

 

Let’s give a rousing,
rumbling, roaring
yell. Ring-tum Phi,
stickeribum...

Football cheer, 1897.

 

 

the editors heretofore were
forced to cram in a limitless
number of locals, they always
bewailed the dismal incongrui-
ty. Henceforth, we rejoice to
say, the Collegian is freed from
matters of this kind, and will
not be compelled to try to serve
two ends at once...”

“Gentlemen of the Ring-tum
Phi, you have our best wishes.
Gentlemen of the Ring-tum Phi,
we give you our sincerest
thanks. Students of W. and L.,
we congratulate you on the ad-
vent of the long needed week-
ly!”

The year was 1897. The
Southern Collegian was still a
high-quality magazine, being
published by the Graham
Literary Society. The Ring-tum
Phi was designed to be a
somewhat lighter, perhaps even
ribald, complement to the Col-
legian.

Eighteen and _ ninety-seven.
The year the football coach had
to send away for a special
noseguard “‘to protect the col-
ossal proboscis which accom-
panies Mr. Fitzhugh’s coun-
tenance.” (‘‘Mr.”’ Fitzhugh was
a student, everybody then was
Mister or Doctor or Professor
or Reverend.)

New Members Keep Up Yes’
High Standards In Drama

by Michael Sokolowski

Just as 1978’s Tormato makes
its first appearance in the cut-
out bins, the two new members
of Yes make their first ap-
pearance on the latest addition
to the Yes repertoire: Drama. If
the album was hurridly con-
ceived and recorded (Trevor
Horn and Geoff Downs joined
the band in May), it is hardly
noticeable. The new songs are
for the most part quite well
written and expertly perform-
ed.

Steve Howe and Chris Squire
as usual are at their virtuosic
best, while Alan White (the
weak link in the band since the
departure of Bill Bruford) pro-
vides us with his typically
heavy rythmic backing that is
at best functional and unob-
trusive and at worst ponderous
and obnoxious...White, a fine
rock and roll drummer to be
sure, simply does not have the
chops to adequately drive a
band whose music is as com-
plex as that of Yes. As a result,
the technical fireworks of Howe
and Squire are contrasted by an
often simplistic and
unimaginative drum line.

The good news, however, is
that ex-members Jon Anderson
and Rick Wakeman have been
satisfactorily replaced by
Trevor Horn and Geoff Downs,
who surprisingly enough, are
former members of the Buggles
(remember their unforgettable

classic, Video killed the Radio
Star?). Horn, admittedly, does
not have the range of vocal ex-
pertise to match Anderson, yet
he knows how to use what he’s
got, and with him Yes can main-
tain that signature ‘Yes
sound.”’ Horn also plays
acoustic and electric guitars in
concert and proves to be quite a
proficient fretless bass player
on Run through the Light. Geoff
Downs establishes himself as a
fine keyboardist whose solo
lines and synthesizer tonalities
are far more interesting than
those of Wakeman. Though

Downs’ technical abilities
perhaps fall short of Wake-
man’s, his conceptual

capabilities are light years
ahead of his’ tasteless
predecessor.

The biggest surprise of the
album is the fact that its two
best songs, Machine Messiah and
Into the Lens were both compos-
ed by Horn and Downs. Machine
Messiah, the record’s opening
selection, is undoubtedly the
finest composition to be found
on Drama: It is a thematically
well-developed song, replete
with rhythmic and dynamic
contrasts, featuring crisp, tight
ensemble playing as well as the
superb vocal harmonies for
which Yes is renowred. The rest
of the songs, with one exception.
are similarly well-conceived

The Ring-tum Phi, October 2, 1980, Page 5

 

 

On The Road To Sweet Briar

Many Washington and Lee
students will remember a
former Sweet Briar Ad-
ministrator’s words when he ex-
plained that married students
were not permitted to enroll
there because ‘‘only virgins
sleep in Sweet Briar beds.”’ But
a prominent insider’s guide to
colleges says he is wrong, and
we tend to agree.

Last year the Ring-tum Phi
described Sweet Briar College
in Amherst as ‘‘the most closely
guarded bastion of the Southern
gentry in the area, probably in
the entire South.’’ Overall,
Sweet Briar still runs the
tightest security with Randolph
Macon finishing a close second.
And yes, there are still some
fraternities banned from the
campus because of parties
thrown a few years back.

“Sweetbush”’ or simply ‘‘the
Bush,”’ as some Minks prefer to
call this lovely school, is blessed
with the prettiest campus in this

campus in the entire world, bar-
ring the Tibetan schools for
Monks in the Himalaya Moun-

tains. On the far side of campus
is the famous Boathouse, home

of the annual ‘‘Bums”’ dance, or
“bogus ball’’ as some call it.
The Boxwood house is on the
other side of campus from the
Boathouse and is a nice place to
stop for an unusual to bizarre
evening. For those of you enjoy
middle of the road action and
sublime entertainment, there
are the various dormitories.
But be selective, some of those
girls are closer than you think!
However, should you be talk-
ed into spending the night, The
Bush can be bad. You see,
before entering the Bush, you
must stop at a photomat stand
where a slow-witted security of-
ficer takes down your name,
license plate number and
whatever information he thinks
is relevant on a given evening.
At the witching hour he will
come looking for ‘‘male

Visitors.’”’ These guys mean
business and have been known
to search a few closets. You
might try hiding under the bed
or running down the fire escape
if things get too bad.

Like all parties at the sur-
rounding girl’s schools, Sweet
Briar’s parties offer a
miniscule amounts of warm
beer, smoky rooms, a variety of
bands and clothes which look
like patio furniture designs. As
you all know, the ‘“‘women’’ at
the Bush love to ride horses, a
campus activity they can well
afford with so much spare time
and an isolated campus.
Sometimes the bright clothes
and equestrian image form a
mellow blend which can provide
for a good time. Of course, there
are other times when the two
factors combine to make the
place rotten. On the whole, the
Bush is a good road trip, maybe
the best, though we cannot tell
you why.

Commentary:

 

Forget the Talk,
Ali Still Great

by Ralph Frasca

From the Washington Post to
the Kalamazoo Kaliedoscope,
so-called experts have been fill-
ing the sports page in the past
fewdays, expounding on how
Mr. Muhammed Ali will be
pulverized, pounded and
generally embarrassed by a
flurry of flying fists from one
Mr. Lawrence Holmes in
tonight’s pugilistic exercise.

To those of you who have been
involved in lifelong spelunking
expeditions, and who have
emerged just long enough to
partake of some overpriced
delicacies at the snack bar and
stumble across a copy of our
beloved Ring-tum-Phi, which
some industrious Woods Creek
student used for a birdcage
liner, let me explain the two
aforementioned gentlemen.

Mr. Ali, a would-be poet and
philosopher, has seen fit to take
flamboyancy to childish ex-
tremes. You see, ladies and
gentlemen, Mr. Ali is constantly
in need of some cash, which is
why he is emerging from retire-
ment for the umpteenth time.
He has not fought since
September of 1978, and during
the course of two years, the
millions of dollars he recieved
for beating the Toothless
Wonder, Leon Spinks, has
somehow been spent. Now, one
may wonder how some $6
million can be spent over the
course of two years. Overtipp-
ing the kid who delivered the
pizza? Who knows. Anyway, $8
million should be enough to hold
him over for a little while, until
he comes out of retirement
again.

Mr. Holmes is playing the
strong, silent type, the good guy
who has quietly vowed to
silence forever the boisterous
braggadocio of his Trampas-
like opponent. All of Ali’s recent
competition has opted for the
same image. After all, modesty
is one of this nation’s great

values, right? This attitude just
doesn’t seem to flourish in the
bizarre world of boxing,
though, and the consensus is
that the gregarious Ali is the
people’s choice every time.

Truth is, Holmes is probably
the best fighter Ali has faced in
the last few years, and this
match will be a challenge to see
if Ali can still stick it to the
other guy, like he did with such
good boxers as_ Frazier,
Foreman, and Liston, and such
human punching bags as Scott
LeDoux.

In my lead I mentioned the
“experts,’’ journalistic sages
who shove the box sceres of
also-ran baseball teams into the
nether reaches of the sports
section so that they may
nauseate us with unceasing
repetitions of Ali’s virtual
senior citizenship. The writers
have all but confined Ali to a
wheelchair in their prosaic
fashion. As a beacon of truth, let
me state that Ali is actually a
very healthy 38 years old. Yes,
he is in fine form, and yes, I
believe he will defeat Larry
Holmes.

Now, I didn’t say that Ali
would trounce or crush Holmes.
I don’t believe that Ali can do
that to so expert a fighter.
Therefore, the fight will pro-
bably be a fifteen-round en-
durance test.

Why would anyone want to
pick an allegedly bedraggled
old man like Ali over a seasoned
young lion like Holmes? Well,
when this writer was knee-high
to just about everything,
Muhammed Ali was champ.
When I entered elementary
school, Muhammed Ali was
champ. When I recieved my
first kiss, Muhammed Ali was
champ. In a pensive moment
during the course of writing this
article, it occurred to me that
Muhammed Ali will probably
always be the heavyweight

Booters Lose To WVW, 6-1;
To Host Davidson On Sunday

by Mark Schramm

With nine of its starting
eleven players having been
recruited from foreign coun-
tries, West Virginia Wesleyan
proved to be too strong for
W&L, walking off with a 6-1 vic-
tory over the Generals last
Saturday.

Two goals within the first ten
minutes, the first on a ball that
was miscleared by the defense
and rebounded into the net, the
second on a near-post corner
kick that eluded goalie Kevin
Carney, deflated a fired-up
W&L squad.

“Our youth showed in the de-
fense,’’ said Coach Rolf Pira-
nian. ‘‘We’re starting four new
fullbacks and they had to try to
keep up with guys that play on
an international level in their
home countries. Their ball
skills and speed were too
much.”

The loss of Defensive Back
Tad Renner to a leg injury
hastened the decline of the
defense. ‘“Tad is our key player
on defense,” Piranian said.
“The other guys look to him for
leadership. After he went out,
we became a bit disorganized.”’

Actually, were it not for some
breakdowns in the midfield and
some bad luck, four of WVW’s
goals could have been pre-

vented. Their fourth goal of the
first half was typical — a ball
lobbed toward the W&L goal
floated just over the outstretch-
ed fingertips of goalie Carney.
“Those garbage goals did us
in,’’ was-an opinion shared by
several of the players after the
game.

Despite the 4-0 deficit at the
half, the Generals continued to
play aggressive soccer and
began taking the play to WVW.
The Generals’ front line of Tom
Elder, Captain Mark Turner,
and Brad Poorman consistantly
applied pressure to the WVW
keeper.

Poorman had another out-
standing game as he unleashed
several shots from his right
wing slot and clearly dominated
his defender.

The Generals’ lone goal came
on a brilliant individual effort
from freshman center Roland
Simon, who stole the ball at
midfield and dribbled right
through the middle of the WVW
defense. Stopping at the 18 yard
mark, he fired a shot that found
the upper right corner of the
net, leaving the startled goal-
tender flatfooted.

Simon was voted Player of
the Game by his teammates.

The Generals continued to
work hard, but the cifects of a

five hour bus ride and the loss of
Sweeper Peter Collins caught
‘sp with them in the final 20
minutes.

Piranian didn’t seem too per-
turbed over the loss. “We’ve got
to look at this positively;” he
said. ‘‘Our offense played well.
The defense had some prob-
lems, but it’s nothing we can’t
fix with some practice.”

The Generals’ third con-
secutive road game is this
Wednesday at Hampden-
Sydney, in a renewal of one of
ODAC’s most heated rivalries.
“It will be a tough, exciting
game, and we’ll be gunning for
goals from the opening whis-
tle,’’ Piranian said. Their offen-
sive punch will be given a lift by
the addition of speedy Center
Ted Wilkerson, who is being
brought up from J.V.

The Generals’ first home
game is Oct. 4 against Division
One ranked Davidson.

In Brown Invitational

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
traveled to Brown University
last weekend for the Brown In-
vitational tournament, where
they dropped all three of their
games, losing to Brown 13-5, to
Harvard 10-7, and to MIT 10-7.

The losses came after the
previous week’s impressive 18-9
victory over Johns Hopkins.
The Generals travel this Friday
to the Slippery Rock Invita-
tional, to compete against
Bucknell, Indiana of Pa.,
Princeton, Millersville, and the
host team.

W&L’s major problem con-
tinues to be in its defensive
play, where breakdowns at

Netmen Win Twice

by Phil Murray
The W&L Generals’ tennis
team ran into some tough Divi-
sion I competition this weekend
in Annapolis, coming away with
only two first-round victories.

Number one Peter Lovell cap-
tured a first round triumph in
the A Flight by defeating
Swarthmore’s Rod Dovdle in
straight sets, 6-3, 7-5. Lovell
could get no further, however,
losing to Navy standout Craig
Morrison, 1-6, 4-6, in the quarter
finals.

Doug Gaker was also in the A
Flight. Gaker, though, was un-
able to seriously challenge in
either of his matches, losing 1-6,
4-6, to Inaki Calvo of Maryland
in the first round and 10-3 in a
ten-game pro set consolation
match.

The number three and four
men, Steve Denny and Wes
Younge, suffered runaway de-
feats as well. Denny lost to his
Penn. St. rival 2-6, 0-6, while
Younge went down, 0-6, 1-6.

The only other victory of the
day came in the D Flight where
freshman Evans Crowe scored
a convincing 6-1, 6-3 victory in
the first round. Although he lost
a tough 10-6 second round con-
test, Coach Franke saw Crowe’s
performance as one of the
brightest moments of the
weekend.

The doubles team could not
muster a victory in their four
first-round attempts. The first
team of Lovell and Gaker had
the best chance, but lost a hard
fought match to the Maryland
team of Calvo and Kitty, 4-6, 6-3,
4-6. The other three, Denny and
Younge, Mark Williams and
Tim Baird, and Mike Reed and
Sumner Bouldnin, each lost in
straight sets.

This weekend the Generals
travel to Harrisonburg for a
four school round-robin tourna-
ment. The Generals face James
Madison Friday and Richmond
and VMI Saturday.

The tournament should be a
better testing ground for the

 

critical moments were respon-
sible for the losses. These
breakdowns were not individual
mistakes, but, instead, were
what Coach Remillard called
“mental mistakes that all
young teams make.”’

Remillard himself also took
responsibility for some of the
mental errors of the tourna-
ment,

The major bright spot for the
team was its obviously superior
swimming skills, which are the
result of intense preseason
training. The play of freshman
Rand McClain, who scored six
goals in the tourney and leads
the team with a season total of
nine, has also been impressive.

relatively inexperienced
players vying for the number

McClain is followed in point
totals by fellow freshman Don
Smith with seven and junior
captain Mike Bernot with six
goals.

Despite the losses and the
poor defensive play, Remillard
expressed optimism for his
young team. “Our successes
may be a while in corning, but
when they do come, they will be

Reading Bestsellers

While most of us are busy
reading Business Law, Chaucer
and various other masterful
works calculated to improve
our fledgling minds, college
students around the nation are
mastering the complexities of
other literary works.

According to a list compiled
by The Chronicle of Higher
Education, some of the top
books college students are
reading include ‘‘Sophie’s
Choice”’ by William Styron and

‘The Empire Strikes Back” by
Donald F. Glut.

Styron’s book is about “‘star-
crossed lovers and the nature of
evil’’ and the latest Star Wars
Book speaks for itself.

But the most interesting book
on the list is “Petals on the
Wind’’, a masterpiece in which
“the children take revenge”’ in
a horror sequel.

And professors wonder why
college students are illiterate.

lilting melodies are marred by

disorganization. The ascending
melodic line of the verse is
obliterated by a static, poorly-

a singularly frustrating listen-

skip over.

The lyrical content of the

noteworthy. As is their custom,
Yes has come up with some fair-

which is not all that difficult to

by no means on a par with
Fragile, Close To The Edge, or
Relayer, it is easily as good as
most of the Yes collection. The
group is currently on tour witha
show that incorporates most of
Drama with much of their old
material dating back to The Yes
Album. Not a bad achievement

In the last issue, we presented
interviews with three of the six
new members of _ the
undergraduate faculty at
Washington and Lee: Pro-
fessors E. A. Vincent, Herman
A. Lauter, and Lawrence E.
Babits. In this issue, Iain S.
McLean, visiting professor of
politics; David Bausum, assis-
tant professor of mathematics;
and Richard F. Grefe, instruc-
tor and assistant reference and
public-services librarian are
featured.

McLean, who was born in
Scotland, is university lecturer
in politics at Oxford, where he
has been for two years. He is
here in the U.S. for the first
time through an exchange ar-
rangement between Oxford and
W&L, and is teaching a course
in British politics on Tuesday
afternoons.

While in the U.S. McLean
plans to study the 1980 presiden-
tial election for a book he is
writing on American politics
and government... McLean
recently returned from Denver,
Colorado, where he has been

following the campaign of
Senator Hart, and pursuing one
of his interests, railroads.

“Colorado has the largest col-
lection of preserved steam
railroads in the world,” said
McLean. He traveled on the
Cumbers and Toltec line,
“which must be one of the two
or three most spectacular
steam lines in the world.”

McLean noted one major dif-
ference between teaching at Ox-
ford and here is the size of
classes. “We (at Oxford) teach
in very small groups, especially
in our subject (politics), often
with just one student,”’ he said.
Students are required to write
an essay per week, and since
the teaching is on a one-to-one
basis, ‘che can’t escape.”

Among McLean’s other in-
terest are music, mountaineer-
ing, rugby and squash.

from Jacksonville, Florida. He

reference and public-services
librarian.

Grefe applied for a position
here last year, but was turned
down. However, his name was
kept on file, and when the cur-
rent position became open, he
was contacted, and, after
another interview, was hired.

Grefe specializes in the
reference aspect of his job, in-
cluding the reserve collections,
inter-library loans and com-
merce library.

Grefe said that around
February the library will
hopefully acquire on-line
bibliographic data bases: com-
puter terminals which will
enable students to make
“completely thorough searches
of particular topics within a
couple of minutes.”’

“It'll be an incredible advan-
tage if you’re doing any sort of
in-depth research project,”’ he
added.

More New Faculty Members Interviewed

Grefe “almost hesitates” to
list reading among his in-
terests, being a librarian, but is
also interested in films, hiking,
and sports like baseball, tennis
and softball.

Bausum graduated from high
school in Lexington, but has
also lived in Tennessee,
Chicago, Louisiana, Boston and
was born in Washington, D.C.

Bausum was teaching math
at the University of Minnesota
when he made a decision to ‘‘get
out of teaching math” and go in-
to photography.

He resigned his post, moved
back to Virginia and built a
house in east Lexington, using
his savings. However, he ran
out of money, and took his cur-
rent position at W&L after being

contacted when a member of
the math department went on
leave for the year.

Bausum spends about half his
time in photography now, and
intends to go into the field full-
time. ‘Photography has

.become a profession for me,

and in a way, mathematics is a
diversion from that this year,”
Bausum said.

Bausum is teaching three sec-
tions of math, including one
designed to help students who
had trouble with trigonometry
in high school.

Bausum’s parents live in this
area, and his father teaches at
V.M.I. He likes the mountains
and enjoys music, bicycle
riding and ‘‘building houses.”’

REVLEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The E.C.’s Dilemma

Clearly the Publications Board and The Executive
Committee are entangled in a dilemma. The EC op-
poses salaries and questions the Pub Board’s power to
give editors and business managers money for their
. services. The Pub Board questions the EC’s power
over the board and realizes the board must be
autonomous if it is to effectively act as publisher for
the university’s publications. The solution to this pro-
blem is simple; the EC must explicitly reaffirm its
support for an autonomous Publications Board. In
return, the board should surrender salaries and let
those who want to do the job for reasons other than
money run the school’s publications.

Briscoe’s Plea...

IFC President Monte Briscoe’s plea for fraternities
to scrutinize the content and ramifications of the Ad
Hoc Committee report on fraternities should not go
unheard. Few people at Washington and Lee are ina
better position to gauge what this report means and
where it will lead fraternities. Briscoe seems to have
a clear idea of what the Report entails, and he is con-
cerned.

Although everyone seems to disagree as to what the
effects of this report will be on the future of frater-
nities at W&L, the report calls its own recommenda-
tions “radical.” Briscoe says the report questions
‘the survival of the fraternity system at W&L.’”’ Dean
of Students Lewis John, the Committee’s chairman,
has called for ‘‘widespread discussion before any long
range action is taken.”

Clearly the ball is now in the fraternities’ court.
Needless to say, we support Briscoe’s efforts to
organize a campus-wide forum on the question. The
time has come for fraternities to rally behind their
elected leader, Briscoe, and examine closely the
fraternity issue. It is possible that the future of frater-
nities is at stake. Fraternity members, do you want a
radical change blamed on your apathy? If not, get a
copy of the report, read and discuss it. Look and see
what may be happening to your future.

On The Privileges Of Citizenship

by Jed Dunn

On the front page of any newspaper these days
can be found an article on the military conflict in
the Middle East. News of such world shaking wars
brings to mind the summer registration of this na-
tion’s nineteen and twenty year olds. That
classification includes about one half of the
students at Washington and Lee. The disturbing
fact is. that while these young men can be drafted,
they are simultaneously denied all the privileges
of citizenship.

While serving one’s country in the military may
be a noble and worthwhile endeavor, one is still
bearing the responsibility of citizenship with one’s
life in the balance. It seems fair that if a young
man can be legally drafted to protect our country,
he should also enjoy all the benefits of being a

responsible, voting citizen. But such is not the
case. It is a fact that in Virginia and several other
states a citizen must have reached the age of
twenty-one in order to purchase liquor (and wine
in Virginia). It is difficult to accept that legislators
(elected by us — citizens eighteen and older) can
fairly deny the privileges of citizenship. With a
potential draft just beyond the election, the time
has come for a consistent definition of ‘‘citizen.’’
The rational standard would see a voting-aged
person, who is eligible for the draft, as a regular
class citizen fully entitled to enjoy all the rights of
citizenship. Perhaps the best way to accomplish
this would be to implement a federal law requiring
that equality of rights under the law shall not be
denied or abridged on account of age, provided
that one is of voting age.

Student Warns Of Coup

The Washington & Lee
University administration has
been warned that if they con-
tinue on their relentless course
to destroy the fraternity system
here, a student led coup d’etat
will take place. The organizers
of this coup say they will allow

the administration only a few

more weeks to change its pre-
sent policies or drastic
measures will ensue. If ‘The
New Plan’’ is put into effect, the
organizers hope they can
assume control in a bloodless
coup, similar to the one which
was recently staged by the
Turkish military. However, in
the case of resistance by the
present administration, an ex-
ROTC commando unit, led by
the notorious ‘“‘Dr. Death,”’ will
be standing at ready. Precau-
tionary measures will soon go
into effect and special bazookas
have been sent from Paraguay
to prevent administration
members from attempting
escape via fast automobiles.
The F.I.A. (Fraternal In-
telligence Agency) reports that

the administration is fully
aware of the chances of a coup,
and already extortion, transfer,
and embezzlement of university
funds has begun. The coup
organizers do not seem to be
bothered by this. So said one,
‘‘As long as we control the
university itself, we shall have
no worries. Outside assistance
has been promised by both Qad-
dafi and the Che Guevera
Scholarship Fund. With this
money and fraternal order
mounted by Dr. Death’s com-
mando unit, Washington and
Lee shall always remain a prep-
pie hideaway from the outside
world.”

The organizers of this coup
did all of their planning in
secret, up until this fall when it
became known that the ad-
ministration was planning
another attack on the fraternity
system. Reports show that for
the past few years the ad-
ministration has wanted to take
control of the actual fraternity
houses, but has waited until this
time, now that they believe the

student body too apathetic to
stage any resistance. But now
that the coup d’etat is out of the
closet, so to speak, the student
body has shown wide support.
The F.1.A.-reports that once the
present administration leaders
have been deposed, the student
body favors Jefferson Davis
Futch as the new University
President.

The new administration plans
to run the University in a more
efficient manner, by allowing
the fraternities to operate along
their own guidelines; no longer
forcing students to pay $20.00 to
register their cars, and a com-
mittee that will be forthcoming,
subject to the approval of the
student body by referendum. If
this new constitution passes,
faculty salaries will increase by
54%, with many retirement op-

tions available, and each stu-
dent will be required to take

care of a domestic animal and
tend to a garden piot.

Oh, alas...alas. Woe is me. Numb is my nose. To what ill-fated
fortune, what fraternal fiendishness, what cold comic do I owe my
present sorrow, my ignoble imprisonment. When I last described
the preparations aboard the Golden Ale, I was a young indepen-
dent, a southern freeman with regal heritage and classic costume.
Doctor Snoblow by name and a druggist by trade, I had no disease,
no cankers, no acne. But I was kidnapped by these Foul Greeks and
am now two weeks aboard this slave ship, this floundering garbage
galleon. Forced to consume vast quantities of ale, ale and chips, ale
and hog, ale and chocolate, and later raped by the whoring sirens of
Maconia, I am now a blaze of red-sores and awash with silvery pus.
I fear I am not long for this world. ft is with a failing hand that I
relate to you the sorry events of this slave rush. Woe is the life of the
coca leaf-peeler.

On the third day out, I found myself in the company of the
bootblacks. They seemed happy enough scrubbing the decks for the
night’s pig roast and singing their gospel chanties. Their earthy
black skins were fading; soon they would be sophomores-second-
class. New slaves would toil in their stead. I felt sorry for the
pledges and allowed them to polish my boots, and offered my magic
snuff. Then that dreadful cry from the crow’s nest.

—Jolly Roger sighted on the horizon. All hands on deck! Man
your stations.

The accursed Captain High barked commands,

—You there, you scad, unchain me from this wench. Hand me my
bottle, and send this whore away. Away I say. Where be these
pirates and how many guns aboard? Where is Jack Black? Fire the
bongs and burn the hemp. We'll stone ‘em. Hi ho, Jack, what do you
make of it?

—They are Trojans, Captain sir, from the Institute...Ruthless
and bloodthirsty. Vile and militant. But ’tis worse, sir. They are im-
mune to our intoxicants and impervious to our diseased ladies.
Their only weakness is in the brain. Cunning words and fast double-
talk will defeat them. They cringe at knowledge and feed on ig-
norance.

—Good thinking, and just in time. The shaveheads are alongside.
Where is that fountain of wit, that tower of wisdom? Command him
to spew forth the seeds of knowledge and destroy these rub-

The next four days were hell. All I could hear was Moby Dick on

But we survived, if you call this survival. We are docked in the

wares, to our parties. They have sold their souls to the devil for a
few highs. Tonight when the moon is low, the gaffs will be out.
Tomorrow they will be hooked. Sorry Freshmen. ..I can offer no ad-

(Reprinted from the Ring-tum

Scandalous Verse ~~

Eighteen and ninety-seven.
The year of the Great Hell Scan-
dal. It seems the very first
editor-in-chief, George
Houston, in the fourth issue of
the neophyte newspaper, pub-
lished a column of ‘Football
Songs,”’ one of which concluded
with this verse:

“Each other’s back, boys,

“‘Has got a knack, boys,

“For making gains, sir,

‘Round the end.

“And it’s a sin, sir,

“For Oberlin (a
player), sir,

‘To buck the V.M.I. boys’ line
so awful hard.

‘Then join the yell, boys,

‘‘And yell like hell, boys,

“Sure enough.

“To W&L U., boys,

‘‘And foot-ball, too, boys,

“‘Let’s give a rousing, rumbl-
ing, roaring yell.

Regulations Set For

Washington and Lee University

October Elections

by Cope Moyers

Rules and regulations govern-
ing student body elections were
presented to the Executive
Committee by the Voting Regu-
lations Board in Monday night’s
E.C. meeting.

The board presented a six-
teen-point plan, which will
serve as a guideline for the pro-
cedure to be followed in the Oc-
tober 20th election of the fresh-
man Class’s president and vice-
president, executive committee
representative, and university
council members. The plan also
applies to the election of the
first-year law E.C. represen-
tative.

The E.C. failed to reach a
definite conclusion over the
number of votes needed to win
an election, however. Although
the student body constitution
states that a candidate must
collect more than 50 percent of
the votes, several committee
members questioned what ac-

  

tually constitutes a majority.

EC President Bob Willis ask-
ed if the number of ballots cast
or the number of votes cast
should be counted toward deter-
mining the majority. After a
lengthy discussion, the commit-
tee decided to discuss the issue
at a later date, agreeing that
the issue more than likely will
not be a problem in the election.

On October 20, students will
be able to vote in front of the
library or at the law school
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Candi-
dates are prohibited from ver-
bal or physical contact with
potential voters within 25 feet of
the polling locations and cannot
place banners or posters within
ten feet of the area.

The VRB also set limits on the
amount of money each can-
didate can spend. The VRB also
required all candidates to at-
tend the EC’s next meeting on
Monday, Oct. 13. Petitions are

Renovations on Graham-Lees Dormitories will have freshmen living two to a room and cause campus-

wide relocation of upperclassmen.

Renovation To Cause Relocations

by Ed Gonsalves

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will begin extensive
renovation of Graham-Lees
Dormitory on June 1, 1981 and
expects the work to be com-
pleted by September of 1982.

The University, in order to
house all the displaced fresh-
men, will use Davis Dormitory,
Baker Dormitory, one of the
Lee houses and three floors of
the Robert E. Lee hotel. All
freshmen will be two to a room.

Upperclassmen who want
University housing will have
the College Inn available to
them in addition to Woods
Creek Apartments and Lee

House II. “To help with the
relocation impact, upper-
classmen are currently being
interviewed to get some feed-
back on the matter,” cites
Frank Parsons, assistant to the
President...

Male law students will have
first priority for rooms in
Davidson Park, while female
law students have first priority
for rooms in Woods Creek
Apartments. Like the fresh-
men, unmarried law students
will live two to a room in David-
son Park unless they choose to
live with more.

Married law students will still

be allowed to live in Davidson

SAB Rejects SABU Proposal

by Frank Billingsley

A proposal to appoint a
representative from the Student
Association for Black Unity to
the Student Activities Board
failed 25-0-2 at an SAB meeting
Sunday night.

Co-Chairman Jamie Small,
who cast one of the two absten-
tions, proposed the motion at
the suggestion of SABU Secre-
tary Mark Smith. Smith, who is
also Head of Public Relations
for SABU, said he made the sug-

Park, but those rooms occupied
by married law students who
graduate this spring will not be
re-rented. Instead, they will be
used to house upperclassmen or
unmarried male law students.
Parsons says, ‘‘We will not
force anybody out of their
apartment. We do not wish to
create any undue hardship.”
‘We cannot guarantee that
everybody will be totally
satisfied,’’ continues Parsons,

“but there are viable housing

options available.”’ ,
If it is determined that the

University has not provided
enough housing to satisfy the

gestion because he felt that
‘““SABU had been apart from the
mainstream of social and ex-
tracurricular activities on cam-
pus, for reasons unresolved.”
Smith said, ‘‘SABU is trying
to make a greater effort to con-
tribute to the social and ex-
tracurricular life at W&L and
we felt the SAB could serve as
one of the vehicles for this.”’
Co-Chairman Pryse Elam,
voting against the motion, said,
“The members of SABU had

ample time to apply for a
member-at-large position on
the SAB and none of them did.
SABU will not be given any
special consideration that
wouldn’t be given to anyone
else.”’ Small also noted that
Smith approached him before
the deadline to apply for ap-
pointments this fall.
Responding to this, Smith
said, “I grant them we didn’t
follow the normal procedure for

Student Hit By Car

by John Ran Smith

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent was struck by a car early
Sunday morning in an incident
which occurred on the Hollins
College campus.

Garic Moran, a W&L fresh-
man, was standing in front of
the Hollins apartments around 1
a.m. when a Hollins student lost
control of her car and ran into
the yard, struck Moran, crash-
ed into another car parked
below and hit a brick wall.

The car knocked Moran ap-
proximately 20 feet, where he
landed on his hands and feet.

“It knocked me about six feet
up into the air and I did a double
flip,” said Moran. “I never
knew I was an acrobat before
that.”

Moran was then taken by am-
bulance to the Roanoke Com-
munity Hospital where he was
treated for a cut on his face, a
knee injury and released.

Moran said he is not pressing
charges, but that the Hollins
sophomore, whom he refused to
name, is to pay for the medical
bills involved with the accident.
No one else was injured.

Other news from the police
beat includes a pair of thefts.

Robert N. Joyce Jr., a law
student, reported October 1 to
the Lexington Police Depart-
ment that an estimated $200 to

$300 worth of goods was stolen
from his car while it was parked
in the upper law school parking
lot.

According to the police re-
port, an AM/FM cassette
player, about twenty cassettes,
and a pair of Nike shoes were
stolen from the car between
9:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. last
Wednesday. ; ‘

Edward J. Bedford, also a
law student, reported a silver
car cover was taken off his 1957
Triumph TR3 while it was park-
ed in the lower W&L lot on
Saturday. The estimated value
of the cover is $40 to $50.

WE&L Students Have Low Loan Default Rate

by Dave DeHay
Less than 10 percent of
Washington and Lee students
are presently in default on
NDSL educational loans, accor-
ding to Michael Bartini, Direc-
tor of Financial Aid.

‘We don’t have an_ un-
favorable default rate,”’ said
Bartini. “‘The rate is below 10
percent, which is acceptable by
the standards of the National
Direct Student Loan Program
(NDSLP). The default figures
for Guaranteed Student Loans
are not “generated for the
financial aid’ Bartini added.

Under the NDSL program,
the individual university

operates the loan, which is
sponsored by the _ federal
government on an 8/9 basis.
The university supplies 1/9 of
the loan.

The loan is to be paid back in
a maximum of 10 years, start-
ing nine months after the stu-
dent graduates, at a three per-
cent interest rate. Under-
graduate students may borrow
up to $5,000 in four years, not to
exceed $2,500 in the first two
years.

NDSLP loans are based on
need, and are extended to 100 to
120 students at W&L, at an
average of $1,100 per loan, ac-
cording to Bartini.

Tuition Increases

By 9.5 Percent

by Tom Baker
Just like everything else, the
cost of going to school is going
up. Washington and Lee
students now pay $4,050 for tui-
tion — a 9.5 percent increase in
last year’s tuition.

E. Stewart Epley, the univer- .

sity treasurer, cited inflation
and the failure of the Capital
Fund Campaign as the two
reasons for tuition increases at
W&L. The Capital fund did not
raise the amount of money that

it was supposed to within the
period that the campaign was
most active.

On a more positive note,
Epley pointed out several in-
stances in wnich the university
has saved or made better use of
its money. Epley and Louis
Snyder, the assistant treasurer,
have improved the Short Term
Cash Management System, the
university short term in-
vestments, to produce an added
$450,000 for the school budget.

The university also dug a well
to provide water for the air con-
ditioning system and put a com-
puter in the power plant to
monitor heating and cooling in
the newer buildings.

According to Epley, despite
all the cost increases, the
university has not had to cut
back on services or staff.

Finally, to add to everyone’s
concerns about higher prices,
the W&L board of trustees will,
in November, probably approve

another increase that will put
next year’s tuition at $4,800.

The GSLP accounts for about
$1 million in loans extended to
650 W&L undergrads. These
loans are not based on need, so
any full time student is eligible,
but the interest rate is higher
(seven percent).

Under the program, the stu-
dent’s bank or other lending in-
stitution operates the loan,
which can amount to-a max-
imum of $7,500 for under-
graduate work. The govern-
ment pays seven percent in-
terest on the loan while the stu-
dent is in college, and after
graduation the loan is paid back
in the same manner as the
NDSL.

Bartini noted that the interest
rates and maximum amounts of
these loans will change in 1981,
because of legislative  re-
authorization of the programs.
The exact nature of these
changes will be detailed in the
next issue of the Ring-tum Phi.

Concern over the default rate
on these loans has prompted the
government to take steps to im-
prove and standardize collec-
tion procedures, stated Bartini.

‘When the government built
the programs, it planned for a
revolving fund, wherein the
money paid back for loans
would then be loaned out
again,” Bartini said.

Bartini added that when the
national default rate on the
loans climbed to an unaccep-
table rate, there was talk of the
legislature wanting to scrap the
whole program and rebuild it,
but it was later decided to im-
prove the existing programs
and collection procedures.

Bartini pointed out that con-
trolling defaults on NDSLP
loans is important because in
the past the government has cut
back funds to the program due
to larger numbers of defaults.

W&L subcontracts collection
and billing agencies to assist in
ensuring prompt repayment of
loans, according to Bartini.

Ramsey Clark and the Berrigan Brothers

by Jack Sharman

So help me, I smell incense. Periodically, the
Sixties, like pubescent mantras, rise up with great
foolishness and foist themselves upon our own
Enlightened Decade. Last Sunday, as I watched
Easy Rider on television, Peter Fonda stared at
his tri-colored gas cap and muttered “freedom”
and ‘“‘split’”’ and “thing” for, catastrophically,
nearly two hours.

However, Easy Rider was amusing, if aught
else. Ramsey Clark and the Berrigans are not
amusing. No, coolie, they are not a band. Surely
you remember Ramsey Clark; former Attorney
General and Lyndon Johnson’s administrative
answer to Tinkerbell? Clark’s liberal posturings
put him in the limelight for quite some time during
the late Sixties and early Seventies. Since then he
has been mercifully quiescent, rising only now and
then in attempts to save us from ourselves.

The phoenix has risen again: Last June, Clark
went to Iran and spoke at an Iranian special con-
vention entitled ‘‘Crimes of America,” no doubt a
lucid and progressive assembly. So? The catch is
that the President had previously banned travel to
Iran, without special permission, on the part of
American citizens. As a result, the Justice Depart-
ment is currently considering a charge against
Clark of violating the 1977 International Emergen-
cy Economic Powers Act. Clark, little ghoul that
he is, is not bothering with the Justice Depart-
ment. On the contrary, he is urging Congress to set
up a special committee to investigate U.S. ac-
tivites in Iran. He has even begun a lecture tour:
at American University in Washington, he was
besieged by students demanding his autograph,
which causes one to reflect upon the insanities that
must be zinging about the halls of American
University late at night.

He does not have the right to

violate an act of Congress as
he opines and labors.

 

Very well. Ramsey Clark is a private citizen
—albeit one with a public following — and as such
he has a right to any opinion he cares to hold about
the American hostage situation in Iran. He also
has the right to state his opinion in public and to
labor to persuade the Administration to adopt his
views. He does not have the right to violate an act

of Congress as he opines and labors.

The question is as much a moral as a legal one.
Here is an individual who travels to a country
where American citizens are being forcibly held
by the state — or at least with the consent and sup-
port of the state — and who promptly prostrates
himself at a four-day-long propaganda buffet
prepared by a tyrant, a large cast of Persian buf-
foons, and a group of students whose most civiliz-
ed mode of communication is an AK-47 rifle (or,
more likely, a confiscated M-16). It is Ramsey
Clark’s option to speak and act on behalf of
Ramsey Clark and his beliefs. It is not Ramsey
Clark’s option to do so or not, nor is it his option to
make statements as an American representative
that are — I do not use the word lightly — coward-
ly. Clark’s action was intolerable, and he should
be punished.

 

Clark’s action was intolerable
and he should be punished.

 

About the same time that Clark was pirouetting
over American society as Attorney General, the
Berrigan brothers — Daniel and Phillip — were
making headlines for a number of protests,
pranks, and demonstrations on behalf of every
radical chic cause the Sixties had to offer. Daniel
is a priest, Phillip a former one, but the only badge
of office on Daniel is what appears to be a Green-
peace medallion, with which he surely plans to
buy a loaf of bread during the Coming Devalua-
tion. A couple of weeks ago, Daniel and Phillip and
a couple good ol’ boys from the Atlantic Life Com-
munity — an anti-nuclear group — broke into a
Minuteman plant in King of Prussia, Pennsyl-
vania, pounded a few nose cones with hammers,
and poured some of their blood on blueprints.

One does not know. Perhaps they had a buzz:
snorting ground conch shell will do that. Whatever
their motivation — which they said was to draw at-
tention to the “runaway arms race’”’ — their ac-
tion, like Clark’s, was inexcusable. Breaking and
entering a missile plant, and damaging materials
within it, is neither a prank nor a legal means of
protest, nor is it justifiable as civil disobedience,
since there was no government demand weighing
directly upon the Berrigans, and since their action
was not peaceful. It was a crime, and they should
be treated as felons.

Digital Santana is
‘The Swing of Delight’

Sessions With McLean;

‘Contour’ From the 50 s

 

by Spencer Leffel
Following two sub-par efforts (Inner Secrets
and Marathon), Devadip Carlos Santana has
bounced back to record one of the finest albums of
his career. The Swing of Delight (Columbia C2
36590) is indeed a delight for both its superb play-
ing and its clean, true digitally produced sound.
Santana’s working band is augmented on this ef-
fort by a host of jazz notables, including bassist
Ron Carter, drummers Tony Williams and Harvey
Mason, saxophonist Wayne Shorter and keyboar-
dist Herbie Hancock. Carter, Williams, and Mason
perform quite well; Shorter and Hancock are ex-
cellent and disappointing, respectively.
Everything Shorter touches on this album turns
to gold. His sinewy, twisting soprano sax is as
stunning as ever, particularly on “Love Theme
From Spartacus” and “Gardenia.” He also con-

tributes two beautiful compositions, “Shere Khan”

and “Tiger.” Hancock, by comparison, sounds or-
dinary. Creating music as bad as that of his two
most recent albums (Feets Don’t Fail Me Now and
Monster) has apparently affected him adversely.
Most of his solos sound flat and rather lifeless,
especially when juxtaposed against the inspired
playing of the rest of the participants. Herbie
finally breaks out of the fog on “Golden Hours”
when he programs a synthesizer to sound like an
electric guitar and trades licks with Santana. It’s
kind of gimmicky, but at least Hancock sounds ex-
cited on this one.

And what of Santana himself? Happily, he has
never sounded better. All of his trademarks are in
evidence: the sustained tones, the gracefully bent
notes and the flickering runs. Seldom has he used
them so skillfully. Carlos develops his solos with
engaging ideas, not the pointless series of fast riffs
we sometimes hear from certain other guitarists
of the jazz-rock vein. The structural unity of his
playing does not inhibit his emotional message,
but, rather, intensifies it. Santana has never
sounded more joyous. A good example of this
comes in a song called “Swampan Tari” written by
his guru and spiritual leader, Sri Chimnoy. Play-

by Mark Schramm

While it is true that the career of altoist Jackie
McLean has taken several different paths, one
could say that the most pivotal part of his career
occurred in the mid-fifties during his work with
Charles Mingus. It was at this time that McLean
broke free from the shadow of his early mentor
Charlie Parker and developed his own, im-
mediately recognizable, acid, angular tone. This
change in the McLean sound has been well-
documented in a reissue of two 1956 sessions:
CONTOUR (Prestige 24067). This album clearly
defines the emergence of McLean as a major force
on the jazz scene.

The first record of the set predates McLean’s
recording of Pithecanthropus Erectus with Mingus.
It is in every way a “blowing session” of the time,
with the only writing coming at the opening of Up
and the close of Inding, with the rest of the titles
based on the blues or standards. While the spectre
of Parker hovers over the record, we see McLean
just beginning to add his own touches. On Lights
out, McLean shows a stark, piercing, blues-rooted
sound; he also blows several phrases intentionally
flat, which gives the piece a wonderfully melan-
cholic, distant feel.

While 4 Foggy Day is certainly a nod to his
earliest influence, Lester Young, McLean shows
the first signs of his upper-register climaxes that
he would perfect by the early sixties: On Lorraine,
recorded by Parker as Embraceable You, McLean
expounds succinctly on Bird’s ideas, although he
chooses to quote directly at the end.

The second album, recorded several months
iafter the first, is the more enjoyable of the pair.
McLean’s maturity as a saxophonist is clearly evi-
dent from the outset, as he combines bird-like
phrases with his own embellishments. The greater
harmonic variety in the tunes from this session

sources. The Law School pro-
vides the screening room, the
Washington and Lee Student
Executive Committee has con-
tributed $1,000 towards this
year’s budget, and numerous
people in the business and
academic communities con-
tribute privately. The Society
expects a season of nine or ten
films.

Angi Vera is the story of a
young woman’s experience with
love and politics in the newly
Communist Hungary of 1948.
Vera is chosen for political
education at a party school as a
mark of distinction for her
courageous outspokenness. She
falls in love with her teacher, a

So

 
     

a na le el a

married man, and ultimately
becomes more ‘“‘Communist”’
than he, consenting to a process
in which her spontaneity is con-
verted into a politically reward-
ing strategy. Her indoctrination
is horrifyingly complete.

The film is memorably shot in
cold blue-greens for the party
and indoctrination scenes, and
reds and flesh-glow tones for
the after-work scenes, especial-
ly those set in the team-room, a
color scheme which makes
palpable the irreconcilable op-
position the movie demons-
trates exists between the
private and political realms.

In a brilliant, moving scene in
the middle of the movie, the

workers at the school hold a
celebration at which couples,
among them Vera and the
teacher, dance forehead to
forehead balancing ping-pong
balls between their faces in'a
contest to see who can keep the
ball from falling longest.
Though this offers an alter-
native to the emotional severity
of earlier scenes, it also reveals
the impossibility of love and in-
timacy, even at a moment of
Supposed recreation and
romance.

At the end of the movie,
another masterful scene shows
Vera riding in a chauffered
limousine into a secure future
while a woman who attended

the party school with her un-
reachably recedes into the past
ona bicycle.

The Film Society’s second
movie is Yannick Bellon’s Rape
of Love (France, 1979), schedul-
ed for November 7 and 8. All
members of the Society are
welcome to attend a meeting on
Monday, October 20 (this
represents a change in date
from earlier plans) at 7:30 p.m.
in Payne 3 when the next couple
of movies will be selected,
Members are non-students who
contribute $25 or more, and
students who contribute their
time to meet the operational re-
quirements of the Society.

economic, with his gentle vibrato being a par-
ticular delight.

On Why Was I Born, McLean takes a surprising-
ly humorous, urbane approach that works well; he
also uses the lower register of his horn to further
strengthen his ideas and increase the emotional
extremes of his tones. The highlight of the com-
pilation is Confirmation, one of Charlie Parker’s
most challenging Works. On this cut, McLean is
joined by tenorman Hank Mobely, whose cushion-
ed muscularity provides a stark contrast to
McLean’s strident, relentless tone. The pair blow
mightily, with McLean’s strident, relentless tone.

ing over the powerfully persuasive drumming of

more meditative soprano solo.

- Santana’s current band is one of his best. One of
the album’s few drawbacks is that his own unit
doesn’t receive as much space as it might because
of the guest artists. Russell Tubbs is a fine sax-

is very tasty. Graham Lear gets to play drums on
only two songs, but he holds up well in comparison
to Williams and Mason, particularly on the power-

Contour gives us a glimpse of the formative
stages of Jackie McLean’s career. His work with
Art Blakey, his Ornette Coleman influences, and
his drug problems were yet to come. While this
album does not compare to McLean’s Blue Note
issues (Destination Out, or Let Freedom Ring) or his
recent release of The Source with Dexter Gordon,
it is an important foundation, as it allows us to
view the McLean career in retrospect. It shows us
the initial directions that guided this brilliant, far-
reaching artist to his eventual place as one of the
greatest altomen in jazz.

mon thread in all of Santana’s music, and this is no
exception. The group has two virtuosos in Raul
Rekow and Armando Peraza, and they add
rhythmic flavor and tension to every piece.

This is one of the few really good fusion albums
to come out in the last few years. A major reason

for this quality is that this music is truly a fusion of
various musical elements, not dressed-up disco

masquerading as jazz-rock. Santana combines
straight-ahesd jazz, heavy rock, Latin music and
his own soul to create a unique musical ex-
perience. The Swing of Delight ranks with
Abraxas, Caravanaerai and Moonflower as one of
Santana’s best works.

Commentary:

 

The Legends

by Ralph Frasca

The regular major league
baseball season has drawn to
yet another conclusion, resplen-
dent with the surprises, come-
backs and flops that char-
acterize every season. A few
teams were involved in pennant
races in the closing weeks, but
most were merely playing out
their schedule, trying to win
half of their games, —

Laboring on these teams were
some of the best players of the
1960’s and 1970’s, finishing out
careers in mundane, lackluster
fashion. Their roles serve as a
striking comparison to glory
years of their pasts, when they
were among the most danger-
ous hitters or craftiest pitchers.
Lately they had been reduced to
secondary duties for the most
part, lending stability and
leadership to their ballclubs.

Possibly the biggest news of
this baseball season was the
retirement of Willie McCovey,
who teamed with Willie Mays to
give the San Francisco Giants
the most feared one-two punch
in the National League through-
out the 1960’s. Fearing ‘‘Stret-
ch” might be slowing down a
bit, the Giants shipped him off
to the Padres in 1974 for a bag of
broken bats and some lawn fur-
niture. Shortly afterward, the
Padres sent him up the coast to
Finley Land, where McCovey
struggled mightily to revive a
crumbling Oakland ballclub.
His age, 39, weighing heavily
against him, the A’s returned
him to the Giants in 1977, who
accepted Willie more as a favor
to him rather than to fill a
specific need. All Willie did was
knock their socks off by smack-
ing a_ startling number of
homeruns. He followed with two
more prodigious years in 1978
and 1979, but this year Willie
turned 42, and a kid named Rick
Murray was making some noise
in the farm system. And so the
Giants dumped the still-
productive Willie, the best lef-
thanded hitter in history (521
home runs), and an excep-
tionally graceful filler around
first base.

But he was 42. He played with
the enthusiasm and skill of a
man half his age, but the fact
remained, and the arbitrary
and high-handed executives
were irked by a man coura-
geously defying his years, and
so they forced him to retire.

This season is also the best for
Lou Pinella, who has become a
more dangerous hitter with age.
He toiled in the torpid confines
of Kansas City’s Municipal
Stadium for five years before
being dealt to the Yankees in

19/4, where he earned the
recognition he deserved. He has
helped New York build a dynas-
ty of sorts, which has reached
the World Series three of the
past four years.

Lou, who has been seen of lave
frolicking with a bevy of pretty
girls and mugging his way
through a commercial for
designer jeans, has become
disgruntled with his relegation
to part-time status and will thus
hang up the spikes at age 37.
Lou will always be remembered
for his spectacular catches on
the Yankee Stadium outfield
wall, causing the crowd to cheer
while he crumpled to the
ground, still clutching the ball.

Jim Kaat has been pitching
for a series of mediocre teams
since 1959, and will probably
always be around to throw his
tantalizingly slow curve. Kaat’s
pitching can agitate fans and
spectators alike. Those cream
puffs make one’s palms itch,
and one is inevitably over-
whelmed by a desire to hop out
of the stands, saunter up to the
plate and take a few rips at this
guy’s pitching. The truth is, we
wouldn’t have much success
against Kaat, and neither have
major league hitters for the
past 22 years.

Jim was released by the
Yankees early this season, but
was snatched up by the anemic
St. Louis Cardinals, who have
the worst pitching staff this side
of the Southern Seminary soft-
ball team. Kaat has since prov-
ed to be their most effective pit-
cher, and has played a major
role in their climb to fourth
place, past my lovably stagnant
Mets.

These are just three of the
numerous fallen star's who are
winding out their careers in
relative obscurity. Friendly,
outgoing Manny Sanguillen has
since been relegated to sporadic
pinch-hitting duties, but he was
the best-hitting catcher during
the first half of the 1970’s, with
the exception of Johnny Bench.
Mark Belanger, one of the
greatest fielders ever, is still
playing at age 41, 30-year old
Woodie Fryman turned in
another spectacular relief job
for the Expos, and 38-year-old
Tony Perez is still a prodigious
hitter for the Red Sox. And so
on.

These aging legends made
their niche in baseball history,
but have yielded the limelight to
younger men. I hope they play
forever, because I grew up col-
lecting their baseball cards,
watching them perform their
own special brand of magic.

Generals Lose, 14-10, As
Comeback Effort Falters

by Dale Park

After falling behind 10-0 in the
first half, the Randolph-Macon
Yellow Jackets overcame the
W&L varsity football team with
two second half touchdowns for
a 14-10 victory.

The loss derailed the
Generals’ two game win streak
and dropped their season
record to 3-2.

‘‘We missed some important
scoring opportunities,’ said
head coach Gary Fallon.

After recovering an R-MC
fumble early in the first period,
W&L marched to the Yellow
Jacket 15-yard line before the
drive stalled. Sophomore kicker
Bill Devine then booted a 31
yard field goal, but R-MC was
offsides and the five yard penal-
ty gave the Generals’ first-and-
goal at the Yellow Jacket ten.
The offense again stalled, but
this time R-MC_ blocked
Devine’s 24 yard attempt.

Two possessions later, W&L
drove to the R-MC 12-yard line.
As was the problem all after-
noon, the General offense was
again stopped cold within the
twenty-yard line. On fourth-

and-two, Devine hooked a 30
yard attempt wide to the left of
the goal posts.

The Generals began putting
points on the board midway
through the second quarter as
Devine canned a 25 yard field
goal. Six minutes later, W&L
scored again on a nineteen-yard
trap play run by senior fullback
Lee Minetree.

But in the second half, both
the Macon offense and defense
came alive. Relying mainly on
their passing attack to get them
in scoring position, the Yellow

- Jackets scored on a twenty yard

pass play in the third quarter
and a 50 yard run in the final
period.

Although losers in almost
every category of statistics, the
Yellow Jackets racked up a
crucial 5.2 yards per play, most-
ly on the strength of their se-
cond half running.

Commented Fallon: “The
Yellow Jackets began blitzing
linebackers and seemed to run
right into everything we called.
Also, Macon’s quarterback

Sean Shull showed good

quickness and went to his alter-
nate recievers well.”

On the day, sophomore
tailback Chris Cavalline was
held to 62 yards on 23 carries as
the Yellow Jackets’ defense
swarmed over W&L’s newly
found offensive threat.

W&L staged a last-gasp drive
in the final three minutes of the
game, going all the way to the
R-MC one yard line. But an il-
legal receiver penalty against
the Generals put the ball back
to the sixteen yard line and the
game ended with Macon in-
tercepting a desperate W&L
pass attempt.

‘In the second half our
defense pressued itself too
much, and there was a
breakdown in_ individual
responsibility,’ said Fallon.

On October 18th, the Generals
will face a tough Hampden-
Sydney team. W&L defeated H-
SC 20-0 last year at Sydney.
Last Saturday, the Tigers
trounced Bridgewater, 35-6.

Game time is 1:30 p.m. on
Wilson Field.

Netmen Third In Madison Tourney

by Phil Murray

The Generals finished third
behind Richmond and James
Madison this weekend at the
James Madison Invitational
with a 1-2 record.

The netmen got off to a bad
start Friday on the fast
Madison courts losing to the
hosts 2-7, in the first of their
three round robin matches. No.
1 Pete Lovell earned the only
singles victory with a convinc-
ing 7-6 (5-3), 6-1 score. Doug
Gaker and Steve Denny both
lost tight matches, 6-4, 7-5 and
6-0, 2-6, 7-5 respectively.

The no. 1 doubles team of
Lovell and Gaker scored the on-
ly other win 1-6, 7-5, 7-5 against
the Madison team of Snead and
Salas.

The Generals seemed to have
a better feel of the quick courts
Saturday as they thumped VMI,
8-1, in the first of the two mat-
ches scheduled for that day.

The top singles players won-

easy victories over their Keydet
rivals and freshman Scott Ber-
man, playing in the number 5
spot, won his first varsity mat-
ch, 6-1, 6-1.

The doubles teams enjoyed
similar success winning all
three matches in straight sets.

Finally, the netmen faced a
well balanced Richmond team
which ended up winning the
competition. Although they lost
2-7, Coach Franke felt that the
team played much better than
in their first match against

Madison: “With a couple of
breaks, we could have come out
of the singles 4-2 instead of 2-4.”
Lovell and Denny each lost
tough three set matches which
went right down to the wire in
the third set.

The wins also came in close
contests. Gaker won 7-6 (5-0),
5-7, 74 (5-2), and No. 6 Mark

Williams, 6-4, 7-6 (5-4).

Overall, Coach Franke was
pleased with the performance,
especially of the top three
players. He looks for continued
improvement in two weeks
when the Generals host
Maryland, U.Va., and Ohio in
the fourth annual W&L Invita-
tional.

| _ Injuries more or less dictated
the outcome for W&L’s cross
country meet last Saturday.

In their home opener, the
Generals took on Roanoke Col-
lege and Norfolk State College
at less than full strength. They
‘entered the meet knowing that
they would be missing fresh-
man Bill Benson, who will be
out indefinitely. Sophomore
_John Kelafant aggravated a
| sprained knee which he injured
prior to the meet and was
unable to finish. To make mat-
ters worse, freshman Lars
Keeley became the victim of yet
another injury when he sustain-
ed a sprained ankle during the
meet. Under these adverse and
ill-fated circumstances, W&L
finished a distant third, with
| Roanoke and Norfolk State in a
_ dead heat for the first two spots,
respectively.

Coach Dick Miller was not
totally disappointed with the
outcome. “When you are miss-
ing three runners of their

 

Harriers Lose Tri-Meet

|

caliber, you can expect to do on-
ly so well. The rest of the team
gave it their best try and that’s
all I am looking for.”’

For the second time in as
many weeks, freshman Angus
McBryde led the way with a
second place finish, only nine
seconds off the pace. His time of
27:10 represents a reduction of
almost two minutes from last
week’s meet at Mary Washing-
ton. Rounding out the scoring
for W&L were senior co-
captains Charlie Werner and
Howard Herndon, tenth and)
eleventh respectively, and_|
sophomore Mo Gill, who came}
in fourteenth. |

The Generals will take their
1-1 record to Newport News this
Saturday and take on_ host
Christopher Newport College,
as well as Lynchburg College
and, for the second consecutive
week, Norfolk State College.
Whether or not Kelafant and
Keeley will be able to compete
is still uncertain.

 

 

 
by Mark Schramm
The Generals convincingly
swept both matches this week,
first blitzing rival Hampden-
Sydney 4-0 and then blanking
Division I ranked Davidson 2-0
in their home opener.

Two goals by freshman
Roland Simon, his fourth and
fifth of the year, were the dif-
ference against the Hampsters.
Less than two minutes into the
game, Simon was fouled at the
25-yard line. His indirect kick
eluded the defensive wall and
slammed into the back of the
net.

Thirty seconds into the se-
cond half, Brad Poorman bolted
down the wing and dropped the
ball to Simon. The powerful
center rifled a shot goalward; it

deflected off a defender’s leg
and rolled slowly over the goal-
line.

The Generals controlled play
throughout the match, with the
mid-field line of Captain Bryan
Williams, Mark Carduna, Ben
Muskin, and Paul Ritter rarely
letting the Hampsters penetrate
past midfield.

Play was aggressive from the
opening whistle, with both
teams tackling hard. The
superior-conditioned Generals
wore down the Hampsters, how-
ever, and by the middle of the
second half the issue was decid-
ed.

Mark Turner and Brad Poor-
man tallied before the game’s
end. Poorman’s goal came on a
corner kick; he hooked the ball

toward the far post, and the
goalie, attempting to bat the
ball over the crossbar, knocked
it into the net.

Player of the game laurels
were shared by Simon and
Defender Mark Sullivan, who
closed down the Hampsters’
best forward with no shots on
goal. The victory gave the
Generals their second road vic-
tory of the season.

The Generals’ second victory
of the week was an upset of
Division I ranked Davidson,
who entered the game with a 7-1
mark before bowing to W&L 2-0.

Winger Brad Poorman was
again a standout, as he scored
the two lone goals, his second
and third of the year.

Poorman started off early, as
he coralled a pass from Mid-

The Ring-tum Phi, October 9, 1989, Page 7

Booters Blank Davidson, Humiliate H-SC

fielder Ben Muskin and beat the
Wildcat netminder just 2:30 in
the game.

Freshman defender Steve
Smith gained his first assist as
he lofted a pass to Poorman,
who flew down his wing slow
and tallied his second goal 12
minutes into the second half.

The match, played before an
enthusiastic W&L crowd which
turned out despite the wet con-
ditions, was another physical
one. The two teams had clashed
in an indoor tournament last
year (won by the Wildcats 2-1)
in which several fights broke
out; the intensity carried over
to this match.

Once again, the Generals
proved stronger, and by the end
of the game, they were
manhandling the Wildcats. ‘‘We

were hungry for this one,’’ said
Coach Rolf Piranian, ‘We
wanted to avenge that loss.”

The defense was tight the en-
tire match. The ‘No Goal
Patrol” shut down a_ potent
Wildcat front line and con-
tinually pushed the ball upfield.

Goalies Kirk Mancer and
Kevin Carney (who will break
the W&L save record before the
year is out) gained their second
consecutive shutout: The two
alternate halves and comple-
ment each other well, with each
making important saves.

After upping their record to
3-1, the Generals travel to Har-
risonburg to play Eastern Men-
nonite before returning home

Saturday to face Radford
(2:00).

Water Polo Slide Continues; Drop Three

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
travelled to Pennsylvania for
the Slippery Rock Invitational,
where they continued their
disappointing series of losses by
dropping four out of five games
last weekend.

The Generals won their first
game against Princeton by a
score of 13-7. They then pro-
ceeded to lose four straight
games to Penn State (8-7), Slip-
pery Rock (12-5), Millersville
(13-8), and Cornell (12-6). It is
interesting to note that
Princeton was the toughest
competition of the weekend, but
they were the only team that
W&L managed to beat.

The poor showing by the
water polo team this fall is dif-
ficult to understand after last
year’s impressive 20-7 season
and the number of promising
freshmen recruits. W&L
aquatics is blessed this year
with an abundance of young,
quality athletes, but they can’t
seem to get on the right track.

Perhaps the reason for the
lack of success lies in a prevail-
ing sense of complacency. The
team is dominated by freshmen
who for the most part are un-
challenged for their starting
positions. Maybe this satisfac-
tion with a starting role is what
has led to the mental
breakdowns’ which have
plagued the Generals all
season.

Despite their problems,
Coach Remillard has not lost
hope or confidence in his team.
He knows that they have the
potential to be successful, he

 

admits that some of the

season’s mistakes have been his
own, and he believes that the
Generals will play to their
capabilities soon.

Three of the freshman
members of the team had
notable performances in the
tournament. Rand McClain, the
“quarterback’’ of the team,
continues to show steady im-

fellow classmate Don ‘‘Shark’’
Smith lends valuable consisten-

Rock, also the head football
cheerleader, came on strong in
the last two games of the
tourney, leading the team’s
scoring in both.

With all these freshman
names being mentioned, one
might wonder about the play of

Herndon Enjoying

by Ed Gonsalves

Howard Herndon is excellent
proof that Washington and Lee
athletics, often overshadowed
by the: University’s academic
reputation, offers a challenging
and rewarding experience.

A senior, Herndon had never
tried distance running before
coming to W&L. In high school
his forte was the bassoon, which
he played with enough expertise
to earn a pair of All-State band
honors.

‘“‘When I got to W&L, I knew I
wanted to try something else; I
wanted a challenge,’”’ he ex-
plains. ‘‘I had reached such a
point of proficiency with the
bassoon that unless I played 4-5
hours a day, my skill would
diminish. I wanted to start from
scratch and accomplish
something new.”

The motive to try cross coun-

try came from his sister,
herself a runner, and a good
friend who was a World Class

 

runner. “Another motive for
taking up the sport was the
health and physical fitness
benefit,’ Herndon adds.

The early miles, of course,

the older and more experienced
players on the team. Admitted-
ly there aren’t many up-
perclassmen on the squad, but

they have also made
themselves notably in-
conspicuous.

Despite this gloomy report,
the water polo Generals are by
no means out of reach of a fine
season, especially considering

were not easy. Prior to enrol-
ling at W&L, Herndon’s last
participation in a sport had
been during his sophomore year
in high school. ;

‘When I started out, the cross

country coach here (Dick
Miller), gave me a lot of en-
couragement,’’ he relates.

“Those first few ten-miles a day
were pure hell, but the guys on
the team were really great. We
were like a family, and that
helped a lot.”

Now with three full seasons of
cross country to his credit,
Herndon has indeed met the
challenge and made the ac-

‘It’s good for the captains to
be consistent runners and bring
solidarity to the team, and it’s
also good that the captains not
be the top runners,”’ comments
Herndon, who placed sixth
overall and fourth among W&L
runners in the team’s first meét
this season. “If the captains
were the number one runners,
the workouts and meets would
be oriented towards an_in-

The Hitching Post

by Louise Seymour

The traditional hitching post
battle held Sunday, September
28, was the new freshmen’s first
experience as a class at Sweet
Briar. They collected buckets of
diluted purple paint to wage
battle against the sophomore’s
blue.

Members of the two classes
attired, in worn sweat pants,
gym shorts, rubberboots, tennis
shoes and bandanas, gathered
at 8:30 p.m. to prepare
Strategies and raise spirit.
Sister classes crowded on the
wall in front of Benedict to spec-
tate and lend support.

At 9:00 p.m., following the
blast of a whistle, the excite-
ment began. The freshmen
formed chains, entwining

themselves around the post,
already colored a very weak
shade of purple.

The sophomores charged for

the initial attack, hurling cups
of blue paint and pouring all of
their energies into loosening
their closely bound rivals. Foul
play, involving pulling, kicking,
and strangling, occurred. When
a casualty resulted, leaping on-
to the freshmen was outlawed.

The periodic rest breaks were
welcomed. When the paint sup-
ply ran low, water was used.
Still, the wetness, coupled with
the cool weather, did not
dampen spirits. By 10:15 when
fatigue set in and recruits were
not to be found, the sophomores
forfeited the post in favor of the
rock.

Cheers of ‘‘Who do we ap-

_ preciate’’ followed. Copies of a

freshman cheer were passed
around before the girls rushed
away to shower off the pale blue
paints covering them. Now the
purple post and blue rock stand
as tributes...until next year.

October Elections

(continued from page 1)
due at the meeting and the EC
will discuss all regulations per-
taining to the campaign and the
election.

After a lengthy discussion,
the committee decided to dis-
cuss the issue further at a latter
date, agreeing that the issue
probably will not be a problem
in the October 20th election.

The Student Activities Board
presented the committee with
its September budget report
and also reported on plans for
Homecoming the weekend of
October 25th.

The SAB spent $248.50 in
presenting three movies last
month and totalled receipts of
$212 in admissions charges. The
board now has $3,713.50 to spend
on movies for the remainder of
the year.

Co-Chairman Pryse Elam
reported that two rock bands
will play at Homecoming in
Doremus Gym the night of Oc-
tober 24th. Both Skip Castro and
the New Riders of the Purple
Sage will perform at a cost of
about $7,250. Included in that

figure is the agent fee, the cost

of setting-up and cleaning the
gym, security and a piano
tuner.

In other business, the Cold-
Check Committee reported that
it had collected $800 worth of
checks and fines since last spr-
ing. Chairman Mike Malesardi
also reported that the commit-
tee is having some problems
determining which students
might have paid during
matriculation since some
checks may have been stolen in
the burglary at the Registrar’s
office last month. He said the
committee hopes to clear the
matter up shortly.

The Executive Committee
also approved a motion to give
WLUR $200 for election cover-
age on November 4th. The
money will be used by the sta-
tion in an extensive effort to
provide Rockbridge County
with up-to-date election returns
and predictions on the local,
state and national elections.

The next meeting of the Ex-
ecutive Committee is 6:30 p.m.
on Monday in the Executive
Committee room.

New Economics Professor

From UCLA To W&L _

by Chris Peacock

Bruce Hale Herrick under-
went a dramatic change of en-
vironment when he moved from
U.C.L.A. to Washington and Lee
this fall to become professor of
economics and head of the
department. But he appears to
be most satisfied with his deci-
sion, as it is something of a
homecoming for the man who
grew up in rural Minnesota and
spent his undergarduate days at
a small Carleton College.

There are obvious differences
between W&L and U.C.L.A.
—they are nearly a continent
apart from each other; one is a
small, private undergraduate

  

 

s
villi

W&L and UCLA.

institution while the other is a
large state university; and Lex-
ington is a town of a few thou-
sand while Los Angeles is one of
the country’s largest cities. Dr.
Herrick has seen some of these
numerical differences in his
own classes. ‘‘My largest class
here does not even approach the
size of my smallest classes at
U.C.L.A.”’ he says, adding that
the large seminar rooms in Mc-
Cormick Hall could not begin to
hold any of his U.C.L.A. classes.

But he seems more impressed
with changes which cannot be
measured in such concrete
terms. The honor system here
provides a stark contrast to
U.C.L.A. where he ‘‘learned to
anticipate a constant drizzle of
cheating,’’ and ‘‘to expect very
little administrative support”
in combatting the problem. Dr,
Herrick emphasized, ‘“The pro-
blem is with a small minority
percentage-wise, but adds up to
five or six people in a class of
500.”” :

He is ‘‘very enthusiastic”
about W&L’s new
Undergraduate Library. While
there are fewer books in W&L’s

‘ . e sts Hey ee

 

   

a

library than in U.C.L.A.’s, the
smaller number of users means
their availability is much
greater, and thus more helpful
to his research. His expertise
has led him to co-author a text-
book (now in sevision for a
fourth edition) on the
economics in Third World coun-
tries.

At W&L Dr. Herrick has
found and been pleased with ‘‘a
lack of bureaucracy and a lot of
formalism.’’ Also, he considers
the school’s liberal arts em-
phasis a necessity. ‘‘I would in-
sist on liberal arts’’ to go along
with an education in economics.
“The aim in_ studying
economics,’’ he says, “is not
just how to make money.”

Along with W&L’s ‘“‘reputa-
tion of high quality’’ the oppor-
tunity to become head of the
department was a major factor
in his decision to come to W&L.
But he emphasizes that he does

. not see his role as that of a boss

of foreman. ‘‘That’s just wrong.
Yet it is something more than a
recording secretary at depart-
mental meetings.”’

Dr. Herrick was on the facul-
ty at U.C.L.A. ever since earn-
ing his Ph.D. in economics from
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1964, but has had
time off for such endeavors as a
sabbatical at Oxford and
several trips to South America
as a consultant for the World
Bank and USAID, the foreign

aid arm of the State Depart-~

ment. Also he has served as an
expert witness on the lost earn-
ings in cases of wrongful
deaths, estimating the lost
economic value of a husband or
wife killed, for example, by a
drunk driver.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Minute By Minute...

REGARDING MINUTES OF THE EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE

1) Once again the previous week’s minutes were ap-
proved unanimously, that is 10-0.

2) The minutes, which might have never been
described in any circles as ‘“‘scintillating,” have this
year plunged to a new depth of mediocrity.

3) It is brought to our attention that portions of these
meetings are written in the present tense.

4) Other portions were written in past tense. A com-
mittee was appointed to investigate this startling er-
ror; members will subsequently be announced in-
dividually.

5) It is necessary that we put forth a resolution to con-
sider the implications which the grinding dullness of
said minutes have on personal attitudes harbored
toward That Body, The Executive Committee, and
the potential damage said attitudes might inflict upon
the committee’s future image with regard to bland-
ness and competence. The resolution, in the form of a
motion, reads: RESOLVED: The Executive Commit-
tee, while reserving its powers enumerated in the Stu-
dent Body Constitution, is strongly urged to place par-
ticular emphasis on the writing of clear, concise, in-
formative, grammatically correct minutes which are
unoffensive and not conducive to catatonia, and which
do not contain such notations as: ‘12. Mackie is
elected into getting rid of an old copier in the E.C. of-
fice.’’, followed up the next week with: ‘10. It was ap-
proved that Mackie could donate the E.C.’s old copier
and addresser to the Day Care Center...’’

Motion denied.

6) Nominations were placed for members-at-large of
the new joint ad hoc committee to investigate frater-
nity decay.

7) The meeting was adjourned at 10:30 p.m.

A Word From Dance Chairman

To the Editor:

As co-chairman of Washing-
ton and Lee’s 1980 Dance
Marathon For Muscular
Dystrophy, I would like to ex-
press a belated thanks to all
those (be they dancers,
workers, or spectators) who
contributed to the tremendous
success of last year’s event. To
quote an overused, yet accurate
cliche: ‘‘we couldn’t have done
it without you.”

More importantly, as co-
chairman of W&L’s 1981 Super-
dance to benefit those afflicted
with Muscular Dystrophy, I

‘would like to announce that we

are going to do it again!

Washington and Lee is going to
hold its third Annual Dance
Marathon. This year’s thirty-
hour celebration is to be held
February 6-8 and is sure to be
the most successful ever. We
are determined to present the
Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion W&L’s largest contribution
to date.

The planning and administra-
tion of this year’s dance began
last Tuesday, September 30
with the most well-attended
organizational meeting in our
short history. As all those pre-
sent were told, the success of
our marathon depends on the
dedication and effort of the stu-

dent committees and steering
committee. While many posi-
tions are already filled, we are
always in need of the aid of
others who have been unable to
contact us. If you would like to
help us in any capacity with
W&L’s largest fund raising
event ever, please inquire at the
University Student Center of-
fice with Carole Chappell.
Thank you for your continued
support and assistance in
Washington and Lee’s effort to

help defeat muscular
dystrophic diseases.

Sincerely,

J. Hemby ’81

Spectator

And you thought I was dead...that I had suc-
cumbed to the whoring sirens, my festering
pimples or some Fraternal Fungi. No, I am alive
and well, filled with new adventures and
venomous cynicism. I am a hero, too, admired,
honored, revered, loved, and envied by all. Read
on as I describe my awesome bravery during the
amazing Battle of Lexington.

You may have heard of this citadel of
lawlessness and corruption; Lexington is the
stage for such cinematic greats as West Side
Story, the French Connection, Saturday Night
Fever, and Animal House. The local gestapo,
though, are not concerned with violence. There
are 39 officers on the yellow line detail (in search
of errant autos and weak bladders), and the rest of
the force searches relentlessly for noise violators.
Chief Skurvey has made his position clear.

-I hate rock and roll. Social houses are whore
houses and drug centers. If we wipe them out, we
wipe out corruption; there’ll be no one left worth
robbing and no one left worth raping. The chain-
swinging, stiletto-equipped gangs that terrorize
the rich bastards will make our job easier.

Enter Spectator, your hero. The Battle of Lex-
ington had been raging for weeks. It was classic
Town vs. Gown warfare. The hoodlums had raped

two beautiful dates, stolen a cache of stereos, van-
dalized the stately fraternities, and attacked

... at War

scores of unarmed gentlemen. When I arrived on
the scene late one Saturday night, it looked as
though one of these bastions of gentility would be
overrun by these ruffians and sewer sluts. Broken
glass, silken bras, and bloody shirts littered the
entrance hall. At first, I figured this was a wild
and exciting party: lots of grain and lots of fun.
But then...

A green, slimy hand touched my date. A green,
slimy hand carressed her breast. A green,

slimy...I fainted. Yet as I fell, my head hit the

volume control on the stereo. ‘Tennessee Stud”’
could be heard all across campus.

Though the police had not heeded the emergen-
cy calls from the besieged fraternity, they arrived
in seconds to hand out a noise violation. When they
entered the house, armed with machine guns and
dressed in undercover clothes (khakis and izods) ,
the anti-sound gestapo looked like more fraternity
boys. The townies, infuriated, and none too in-
telligent, attacked the lead officer. A blaze of
machine gun fire and flashes of returning knives
and bottles filled the air. Hideous screams from
both sides told the tale of death and bloodshed.
And then there were none. The officers had shot all
the gutter urchins, and the urchins had wasted the
police. I awoke and heard one last voice.

‘Damn, this place is trashed. But what the hell;
let’s party!

Dear Editor:

Today I awoke, saw my fire
engine red corduroy trousers
with the large blue decorator
whales embroidered all over
them and for some reason
thought how beneficial tradition
has been for me. I think of how
it has enriched my life. After
all, I have a lot to be thankful
for. I’m a traditional man; I go
to a traditionally conservative
school; I’m surrounded by
traditional people of my own
choice; and I enjoy a traditional
life.

That’s all I really need —
tradition. Tradition is why I en-
joy an all-male school, like
Washington and Lee; it’s so
traditional, but still open-
minded and immensely
cosmopolitan. Tradition is what
keeps me from being surround-
ed by diversions like women,
whom I feel should occupy their
traditional place in life, flaky
intellectuals, and poor people.
Tradition is what enables us,
while associating with those of

our own choosing, to say,
‘‘We’re all men here!”’
Some say that we at

Washington and Lee blindly
follow tradition, but I don:t
believe this; after all, think of
all the significant social
dogmas that have been

eliminated here in the past

Robert E. Lee, our stellar presi-
dent, was a traditional man. In
his short stay here at W&L, he
broadened our science depart-
ment; he affiliated Lexington
Law School with W&L, he
started a business program and
instituted courses in journalism
which were the first such
courses to be offered at any col-
lege in the U.S. What could be
more traditional?

Some say that such acts were
liberal, open-minded, and way
ahead of their time, and that
Lee was ‘‘one of the most far-
sighted educational statesman
of the 19th century.” I’m sure

that everyone can see that Lee’s

dependence on tradition and the
conservative way of life was
what made him the great man
he was. That’s one of the
reasons I think Washington and
Lee should remain all-male:
General Lee would have wanted
it that way. But some liberals
I’ve talked to say that there is
bitter irony in the fact that Lee
was such a far-sighted in-
dividual, and yet the school he
brought to national attention
through his reforms has
become a bastion of conser-
vatism and sexism, and a slave
to misguided tradition which
enforces social atrocities, like

discrimination on the basis of
sex alone, which Lee would
have ceremoniously wiped out
had the times demanded such
action. To this I say, ‘‘pop-
pycock,’’ and advise, as I know
Lee would have done, that all
who don!t like it the way it is
should transfer elsewhere.

I agree with one faculty
member who advised against
coeducation because it ‘‘is
typical rather of Soviet Russian
and Red Chinese society,”’ and
was shocked when I read that a
couple of faculty members who
taught at co-ed schools, believe
that coeducation, ‘“‘tends to
widen the perpsective of the in-
structor as well as the student,”
and that W&L will become an
“enclave of the good old boys
sitting around discussing a

interpret this as saying that we
at Washington and Lee are not
keeping up with the times, but I

myself it’s not true every time I

Law School

Favors Reagan

Ronald Reagan is the slight
favorite of law students at
Washington and Lee University
in next month’s Presidential
election, but independent can-
didate John Anderson showed
surprising strength as he nudg-
ed Jimmy Carter for second
place and reached within four
points of the marginal frontrun-
ner,

The poll, showing Reagan
with 31.5 percent of the vote,
Anderson with 28 percent and
Carter with 27, was conducted
by “Law News,” the student
newspaper in the law school.
Twelve percent of the law
students said they are still
undecided.

Of W&L’s 343 law students;
244, or 71 percent, took part in
the poll.

Anderson’s chief strength
came in the first — and third-
year classes, in each of which
he captured 31 percent of the
votes. Oddly, in the intervening
class, he received only half that
level of support, with 15.5 per-
cent of the second-year law
students.

Anderson came out on top
among law students~ who
characterize themselves as
political ‘independents,’ with
43 percent of that group, to
Reagan’s 20 percent and
Carter’s 17 percent. Half the

party Democrats went for their
party’s nominee, but Anderson
took a quarter of that vote too.
Among self-styled Republicans,
Reagan took 59 percent of the
vote, Anderson 20 percent and
Carter just 7 percent.

‘‘Independents’’ accounted
for a quarter of the poll par-
ticipants, Democrats for a third
of them, and Republicans 31
percent. Others listed no self-
characterization.

Males, who made up three-
quarters of the survey par-
ticipants, chose Reagan over
Anderson, 38 percent to 25 per-
cent, with Carter third at 23 per-
cent. Female law students, who
represented a quarter of the
participants, went for Carter
over Anderson by 37-to-32 per-
cent, with Reagan a distant
third, taking just 8 percent of
the law women’s vote.

membership, but SABU did not
fully decide to take this step un-
til after the deadline. This was a
pioneer move of SABU’s made
after considerable deliberation
— not just a whim.”

Elam said the Board feared
setting a precedent. ‘If we ap-
point an ad hoc member from
SABU, we might as well appoint
one from the Cold Check com-
mittee or any other committee
that wants us to,”’ he said.

Smith disagreed. “I think
SABU is a special entity at

W&L, but if the SAB does not
see our situation as extenuating
then we are prepared to work
through other modes this year.
Next year we will definitely
have a representative in there.”’

Smith said, ‘I feel that a
SABU member could represent
the black minority here. I
believe we have something to
offer that would benefit the SAB
and W&L community as a
whole. We would like to con-
tribute and be heard.”

Both Elam and Small said
they hoped that SABU would not

be upset over the SAB decision
and emphasized that all
members of SABU are welcome
to attend open meetings.
However, Smith said he didn’t
think SABU’s presence would
be effective without voting
privileges.

Still, Elam said a personal in-
vitation to attend all open
meetings would be sent to Jim
Herbert, president of SABU.
Elam added that he could not
stress enough that anyone’s
views are welcome at the
meetings.

Apathy Expected Among Students

With the 1980 general election
less than a month away,
pollsters are predicting one of
the lowest voter turnouts ever
— and the group with the worst
voting record is young people
from eighteen to twenty-one
years old. If you are the
average Washington and Lee
student, the odds are that you

will not vote in November. Com-

is the difficulty faced in
absentee voting.

voting, copies of the Federal
Voting Assistance Guide have

Election Rules Finalized

by Cope Moyers

With one week left before
freshmen and first-year law
student elections, the Executive
Committee and Voting Regula-
tions Board Monday night
finalized rules governing the
election.

Candidates are permitted to
spend a maximum of $10 on
their campaigns, can place 15
posters in selected areas
around campus and must
remove posters within a week
after the election, according to
rules approved by both commit-
tees.

The election will be held Mon-
day with a run-off Thursday if
no candidate receives a simple
majority of ballots cast. Can-
didates are running for posi-
tions on the Executive Commit-
tee, freshman president, vice-
president and university coun-
cil.

“‘We have to have a fair and
equal election,”’ Voting Regula-
tions Board co-chairman Mike
Drinkwater told the candidates
present at the meeting.

“If you have any questions,
ask me before you do it,”’ he ad-
ded.

Renovation Announced
After Newcomb Inspection

A $300,000 project to remodel
Newcomb Hall, Washington and
Lee University’s 96-year-old
former commerce building at
the south end of the Colonnade,
will begin almost immediately
to provide a new home with
substantially improved
facilities for four under-
graduate departments in the
humanities.

Offices in remodeled New-
comb for 22 faculty members in
history, sociology, philosophy
and religion will be ready as
early as mid-April. Work on
classrooms and seminar rooms
in the building will be com-
pleted over the summer, and
Newcomb will be in full use by
the beginning of classes in
September 1981.

The project will be under-
taken primarily by Washington
and Lee’s own Buildings and
Grounds Department, with out-
side subcontractors brought in

The candidates are also per-
mitted one banner that is not in-
cluded in the $10 limit. Posters
can only be placed in Evans
Dining Hall and the freshman
quad. Law students are permit-
ted to place their posters in the
dining hall and at the law
school. No posters are allowed
in the University Center.

EC member Jeff Edwards
made a motion that voters rank
each candidate on the ballot in
order of preference. Under Ed-
wards’ plan, voters would rank
each candidate according to his

(See ELECTION, page 2)

as the work requires.

The Newcomb remodeling
program will be similar to that
undertaken in Tucker Hall at
the North end of the Colonnade
to provide office and classroom
facilities for W&L’s foreign-
language departments.

The office and classroom
areas of Newcomb will be re-
partitioned to meet the needs of
the four departments. Acoustics
will be improved, and electrical
and plumbing fixtures will be
upgraded, although those basic

systems are in good shape, ac-
cording to the firm of Harris,
Norman, Giles & Walker, the
university’s structural
engineers.

That engineering study also
determined that Newcomb is in
good structural condition —
although the remodeling pro-
ject will also include cosmetic
repairs to the facade of the
building.

fessor of engineering and

Noise Violations

Outrage IFC

by Mike Perry

The Interfraternity Council
met last Tuesday night to
discuss recommendations
made in a report by the Ad Hoc
Committee on Fraternities, but
discussion abruptly shifted to
law enforcement in Lexington,
specifically the city’s noise or-
dinance.

“We need to know exactly
what constitutes a noise viola-
tion,’ Sigma Alpha Epsilon
representative Mason Ellerbe
said. Many fraternity represen-
tatives complained that the
police have been inconsistent in
their enforcement of the city’s
noise ordinance. A Zeta Beta
Tau representative charged
that the police issued his house
a summons and “gave no warn-
ing at all, but some houses get
warned.”

IFC President Monty Briscoe

added that the “police shift
back and forth’’ on the question.
Kappa Alpha President John
Northington suggested that it
was time the “IFC stood up and
did something”’ such as retain a
lawyer to contest noise or-
dinance summonses issued to
fraternity houses. Northington
also questioned the IFC’s policy
of automatically placing houses
convicted of a noise violation on
social probation for two weeks
as “just going along with the
police” with regard to the mat-
ter.

Briscoe was not sure whether
or not the policy was contained
in the IFC by-laws, but explain-
ed that the social probation
punishment was adapted in an-
ticrpation of rulings by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee in such
cases. Briscoe added there are

Alcohol And Alcoholism At W&L

Dr. Worth sees the reason for alcohol

—~

Kegs — down the road. Hawaiian
party-rum punch. Tired of beer? Come to
a mixed drink party. Kegs, kegs, kegs.
More kegs.

GRAIN.

Variations on a theme. The style and
setting change — fill in your own frat,
etc. — but the main attraction on the
marquee is alcohol. At Washington and
Lee University, fraternity or
undergraduate social functions regularly
— inherently — _ include liquid
refreshments of an alcoholic nature. And
lat W&L, grain alcohol reigns supreme. A

 

But W&L students can’t be singled out
in their penchant for drink. A Time
survey of several New England cam-
puses a year ago revealed that 95 percent
of all undergrads were at least ‘‘occa-
sional drinkers.’”’ Twenty-nine percent
said they regularly consumed a six-pack
of beer or five shots of liquor at a sitting
—‘“heavy drinkers.’’ Time called the
escalating use of alcohol ‘‘the single
greatest drug abuse on any campus,” a
nationwide problem of proportions like
never before, and a problem which is
particularly prevalant among college

All true, says Dr. James Weldon Wor-
th, the counselling psychologist at
Washington and Lee, perhaps to an even
greater extent here in Lexington.

“W&L has a reputation as a hard-
drinking campus,’ Dr. Worth em-
phatically points out. “Drinking is
presented as a way to be accepted.
Freshmen get the message that to be
cool, you have to do a lot of drinking
—right from the word go.”’ (The Time
statistics show a higher percentage of
drinkers among freshmen than up-
perclassmen. )

abuse as two-fold, rooted in W&L’s “‘very
competetive atmosphere of academic
and social tension —a convenient way to
blow off bad vibes.”

In the academic realm he says, ‘‘Lots
of anger is generated by not doing as well
as one thinks he should be doing, and the
student drives for critical reasons, for
reasons of depression.”

Socially, students find themselves
under pressure as well. ‘To jump in a
car and go down the road to a mixer can

be scary,’’ he believes. “Trying to get 7

Outing Club Plans Activities

by Chris Peacock

The Washington and Lee
Outing Club has come about this
year in an attempt to meet the
interests of an increasingly
diversified student body, as
well as to take advantage of the
excellent terrain in the areas
surrounding Lexington.

Included in the university
budget this year is $2,500 to
meet the initial expenses of the
new organization. Dean H.
Robert Huntley, program direc-
tor of the club, used the money
to purchase backpacks, tents,
cooking sets, climbing ropes,
and other equipment to be used
in the club’s activities. Also, the
Student Activities Board voted
last spring to give its four
canoes to the club, a decision
for which Dean Huntley is
“very grateful.”’

Dean Huntley stressed that
the Outing Club is no new idea,
pointing out that Professors
Charles Boggs, John McDaniel
and William Pusey ‘‘laid the:
groundwork for such ant
organization some years ago.”’
However, they did not obtain
university funding and their
plans did not work out.

The club has’ scheduled

several activities for the re-
mainder of the term, including
backpacking, canoeing and cav-
ing. Most of these plus a

Christmas party are in conjunc-
tion with similar  organiza-
tions from Hollins and Sweet
Briar Colleges. Groups from
Mary Baldwin and Randolph-

preference with one being the
first choice.

“Under this system, voters
can pick their first choice plus
their run-off preference,’ Ed-
wards said.

“It’s pointless to start-off an
election knowing there’s going
to be two elections,’’. Edwards
added.

After a short discussion, the
committee rejected Edwards’

motion.

“Half the time they (the
students) don’t even know most
of the candidates, so voters
really couldn’t rank their

. preferences,’ EC member.

Marshall Clark said.

In other business, the com-
mittee heard monthly activity
reports from the Student Bar
Association, Mock Convention,
Calyx and Ariel.

Mock Convention spent $12.14
in September while the Student
Bar Association spent $4981.61
last month.

The Executive Committee ex-
pressed its displeasure that
both Ariel and Contact had fail-
ed to report properly to the EC.
A motion was passed requiring
both committees to revort back
to the EC at the next meeting.

Macon Woman’s Colleges will
join the W&L club for activities
later in the year.

-The Outing Club has approx-
imately 35 active members,
almost all of whom are up-
perclassmen. However, it is
open to law students and
members of the faculty and
staff as well as_ to
undergraduates. Dean Huntley
found it surprising that most of
the members are in fraternities
(excluding freshmen), because
one of the reasons for founding
the organization was, according
to ‘‘Outing Program Proposal,”
“the University’s increasing
concern for the social life of its
independent students.’’
However, he was quick to add
that he does not want the
organization to be considered
an alternative to either indepen-
dent or fraternity life.

Emphasizing that the group’s
activities are expanding more
quickly then he had anticipated,
Dean Huntley likened the pro-
gram to a great primeval atom
exploding into numerous ac-
tivities. Plans call for the club
to be subdivided into six clubs;
backpacking, bicycling, canoe- -

ing, climbing, rafting and ski-
ing. However, members of each
subgroup would be allowed and
encouraged to participate in the
activities of the other groups,
according to the proposal.

Dean Huntley has_ en-
countered problems in arrang-
ing transportation for the
Outing Club. “Originally we
had been led to hope for some
help from one or another of the
vans allocated to the Athletic
Department, thinking that they
had been intended for universi-
ty use.

“‘As Coach Dick Miller phras-
ed it, ‘It would set a bad prece-
dent if we made a van available
to just any university-sponsored
organization which needs it.’

“Fortunately the students
themselves have come to the
aid of the Outing Club,
volunteering their own cars
when university vans have sat
unused in the parking lot. The
particular occasion I have in
mind was on a Sunday morn-
ing.”

A bulletin board further
detailing the Outing Club’s ac-
tivities is on the Colonnade
across from Payne Hall.

New Art Exhibit Features Aquatints

An exhibit of aquatint pain-
tings by the Spanish artist
Francisco Goya opened this
week in duPont Gallery at
Washington & Lee University.
It is on loan to W&L from the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts
and will remain on view
through Oct. 31.

The exhibit, entitled ‘‘Los
Caprichos”’ (‘‘The Caprices’’),
provides a cynical, witty com-
mentary both on life in Spain in
the 18th century and on life ina
highly organized society at any

time and in any place.

Goya, who lived from 1746 to
1828, came from a poor family
in the Spanish province of
Aragon. He became a member
of the Spanish Academy in 1780
and first painter to King
Charles IV of Spain in 1799.

The artist’s personal concern
with social ills was triggered by
the neglect, poverty and stag-
nant society that characterized
Spain in the 18th century. The
social ills were especially ironic
set against the background of

the so-called ‘‘Spanish
Enlightenment,”’ which held
that reason is the guiding force
of man — a philosophy which,
however, went unpracticed by
the corrupt and indifferent rul-
ing powers of the aristocracy
and the Church. Goya produced
‘“‘Los Caprichos” in 1799 to ex-
plore the pretentious world he
inhabited.

The W&L gallery in duPont
Hall is open to the public
weekdays from 9 to 4 p.m. No
admission is charged.

 

REDFORD IN ‘BRUBAKER’

A Compelling, Satisfying Entertainment
sided John Well

 

‘Srebaher, ‘scutes te open

tomorrow at the Lyric, is the
latest feature in Lexington’s
major retrospective Summer
Releases of 1980. A retrospective

- Called Christmas Hits will begin
probably sometime next Mar-
ch.

Praise for Robert Redford’s
directorial debut in last month’s
Ordinary People’ has
already eclipsed the few good
notices he received for
Brubaker. Condemned _ soon
after its release as a failure,
Brubaker went on to financial
success much greater than any
of the macho star vehicles
cranked out early this summer
(Eastwood’s Bronco Billy,
McQueen’s Tom Horn,
Reynold’s Rough Cut, et al).

Brubaker is filmed with those
elements that make a movie a
compelling, satisfying ex-
perience. From its easy,
understated photography to its
memorable characterizations
by actors who do them best,
Brubaker commands attention
throughout and provokes a good

deal of thought after its initial
impact fades.

Redford is Brubaker, of
course, the all-American blond
idealist who takes over as
warden of one of those prisons
in an unspecified southern
state. The prison, as is the
custom in these pictures, is in a
deplorable state of affairs. The
buildings are rotting, there are
beatings, the prisoners are
“loaned out”’ to local communi-
ty members for actual slave
labor, the food is swill not fit for
beasts, etc. One immediately
suspects that Redford, the
gleaming hero, will, after undue
hardship, impose sweeping
reform on the institution, and
that the final fade-out will show
clean, happy convicts carrying
the warden on their shoulders
amid cheers. It doesn’t turn out
that way.

Seems the local folks, who’ve
grown fat over the years
embezzling the prison, along
with the inmate ‘‘deputies’’
themselves, well, don’t none of
them take too kindly to this tow-

headed yankee coming down
and interfering with their
system by cutting off their free
food and labor, and stirring up
the boys.
finds its way to the prison’s
board of trustees, which in-
cludes the governor and a few
powerful state legislators. They
don’t really appreciate
Brubaker’s monkeyshines
themselves, and, except for the
governor’s attractive aide
(played by Jane Alexander)
they can’t find a kind word for
him, either. In fact, what they
essentially tell him is to quit all
this nonsense or go look for
another prison to screw up.
Then they tell him there won’t
be another prison to screw up;
he’ll be black-balled from the
entire region. Undaunted,
Brubaker proceeds with his
reforms.

Redford’s performance as
Brubaker is fine; like so many
bigger-than-life stars of another
era (Gable, Bogart, etc.), he is
Robert Redford on screen.

Film Notes

The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979) Alan Alda stars in his first,
serious effort as a major performer, and the result is one of the bet-
ter Hollywood political dramas in recent years. Alda’s Senator
Tynan, a liberal with high political ambitions, is energetic and at-
tractive; as a father and husband he is negligent and even shoddy.
The acting is powerful from one of last years best casts — Barbara
Harris as the troubled wife, Mery] Streep as the southern activist
Tynan falls for, and venerable Melvyn Douglas, in his umpteenth
senior senator role, turns in a touching performance. It is in-
teresting to note that Miss Streep and Mr. Douglas each received
an Academy award for supporting roles in different films that year,
she for Kramer V Kramer, and he for Being There. Presented by

the SAB, Friday through Sunday October 17-19 at 8 p.m. in du-
Pont Auditorium. Admission is $1.

The General (1926) The silent classic, perhaps Buster Keaton’s
finest film. A comedy of masterful timing and execution, set in the

Weekend in Savannah

by Frank Billinglsey

Student Activities Board co-
chairmen Jamie Small and
Pryse Elam attended a Na-
tional Entertainment Con-
ference this past weekend.

The three-day convention,
comprised of 147 colleges from
the Southeast, was held in
Savannah, Georgia.

Jamie Small describes the
weekend: ‘The contacts we
met were the most important
benefit. We talked to printers,
film representatives, and band
representatives. We saw
specialty acts and attended
educational classes.”’

The contacts Small and Elam
made in the music field will
allow the SAB to book bands
without going through an agent.

Small said. This will afford a
savings of several hundred
dollars normally paid out in
commission fees. Small said he
could also get national bands
for the Cockpit at cheaper
prices.

The SAB also made a deal
with a film agent in which
rather than pay to rent the fil-,
SAB profits from the movie go
directly to the film agent. This
will also save the school hun-
dreds of dollars, Small said.

_ Educational classes that
Elam and Small attended in-
cluded crowd management,
publicity, and contracts and
riders.

Small said that the ideas for

BRUBAKER

(continued from page 4)
Gradually, subtly, he reveals
the character’s nuances and
complexities with good humor
anda sense of reality. Brubaker
is not a hero; such roles seem to
be reserved for science fiction
fantasies these days. In fact,
Redford has said in a subse-
quent interview that he would
have turned the part down if it
had been truly heroic.

The supporting cast works
very well, whooping it up with
southern accents as they fume
over Brubaker. Jane Alex-
ander, who seems to be doomed
to these below-the-title roles
with a hint of romantic interest,
plays a phony liberal who likes
Brubaker’s looks but not
necessarily his principles.
Yaphet Kotto, who was so good
in Blue Collar, gives another

memorable performance as one
of the more perceptive inmate
deputies.

I often base a decision to go to
a movie on what nationally pro-
minent critics have to say about
it. I therefore almost missed
Brubaker after I read that Rona
Barrett called it ‘‘a veritable
firecracker of a movie” or
something like that. In spite of
this advice, I went, and
discovered that sometimes
Rona is basically right, even
though her writing is awful.
Brubaker is as good a movie as
any that came out this summer,
different from most prison pic-
tures in its shifting point of view
and emphasis on the warden’s
office. It is entertaining,
suspenseful, and highly recom-
mended.

Pound Collection in
Rare Reading Room

A collection of letters,
writings and editorial notes by
the famed and controversial
20th-century poet Ezra Pound is
on display in the rare book
reading room of the Washington
and Lee University Library
through the end of December.

The owner of most of the
items, Eustace C. Mullins of
Staunton, a member of W&L’s
class of 1949, made the collec-
tion available to the library for
display. Mullins was friend and
confidant of Pound during the
poet’s later years and is the
author of a book about him,
“This Difficult Individual, Ezra
Pound.”

Pound is considered to be one
of the giants of 20th-century
writing. His works influenced

Generals Receive

Mid-Term Mark ks

by Dale Park

Now at the midpoint of their
1980 season, the Washington
and Lee varsity football team is
showing improvement as com-
pared with last year’s perfor-
mance.

After five games last season,
the Generals held a 1-4 record
and were last in the Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference. This
year the team is off toa 3-2 start
and shares second place in the
ODAC with Hampden-Sydney,
Maryville and Bridgewater.

One reason for this year’s im-
provement has been a change in
team attitude. Said head coach
Gary Fallon, ‘‘the loss to Macon
(14-10) was a big one, but we’ve

been trying to put all the games
we've played, either big wins or
big losses, behind us.”’

“Slowly,” stated Fallon, “‘the
team is maturing.’’ Many of the
starters on last year’s team
were sophomores, such as nose
guard Mike Pressler. The core
of this year’s offensive and
defensive units is made up of
“veterans’’ no older than
sophomores and juniors.

One big addition this year has
been sophomore tailback Chris
Cavalline. Switched from
quarterback, Cavalline has
been an offensive workhorse,
gaining 504 yards and scoring
five touchdowns in the first five
games.

Also, Cavalline filled a big
rushing gap left by the gradua-
tion of W&L’s all-time leading
ground-gainer, Stewart Atkin-
son. (Cavalline was injured in
the Macon loss, however. A
sprained knee makes him a
doubtful starter for Saturday’s
game.

The Cavalline switch also
helped unsnarl W&L’s quarter-
back problems. Last year, Mike
Wenke, Rich Hachenburg and
Cavalline constantly replaced
one another at that position.

This year, said Fallon, the
team has found its quarterback
in the junior Wenke: “There is
no question that Wenke is our
starting QB. But Hachenburg
has continued to work hard and
can be used in situations where
we need him.”

On the offensive line, Fallon
has been looking for another
guard to complement the
steady play of senior guard Jim
Forte. Candidates for this posi-
tion include three young
players; sophomore Ralph
Paris and freshmen Carl
Peebles and Dan Seal.

Another offensive plus has
been the development of junior
tight-end Mike Fogarty. Com-
mented Fallon: ‘Fogarty’s
blocking has improved a great
deal this season and he has been
important in replacing Syd Far-
rar (who graduated last year.)”’
At 6’3”, 215 pounds, Fogarty
proves a big target for Wenke to
throw to and a big problem for
opposing defenses to tackle.

W&L’s own defense, as Fallon
said, “is learning to work
together. Yet sometimes the
defense, especially the secon-
dary, is so intent on making a
good hit that it plays the man
and not the ball.”’

Ironically, the pressure has
become greater on the
Generals’ pass defense because
of the improved W&L offense.

Booters Bounce EMC;
Lose 2-1 Heartbreaker

by Mark Schramm

The soccer Generals split
their two matches this week,
first drubbing ODAC rival
Eastern Mennonite 4-1 and then
losing a heartbreaker to Rad-
ford, 2-1. Their record now
stands at 4-2.

After getting off to a slow
start against EMC, the
Generals rallied behind two
first half goals by Center
Roland Simon (his sixth and ©
seventh of the year. )

Both goals came off corner
kicks.

   

 

k Ben Muskin evades

The first was lofted toward
the far post by Winger Brad
Poorman, and Simon darted
between two defenders and put
a strong header behind the
EMC goaltender. His second
goal was scored through sheer
determination, as he fought his
way through a crowd in front of
the net and headed the ball
under the crossbar.

Play was somewhat sloppy
during the first half, and neither

Rad

team held a distinct advantage,
despite W&L’s two goals. The
goaltending of Kevin Carney
gave the Generals an edge,
however, as the veteran net-
minder turned away some early
scoring opportunities.

The Generals got back on
track in the second half and
dominated the rest of the way.
Midfielder Mark Carduna
tallied his first goal on a spec-
tacular individual effort. Weav-
ing in from the 18-yard line,
Carduna fired a shot on goal.

Brad Poorman scored his
fourth goal of the year on a shot
from his wing slot, as he outrac-
ed his defender down the
sideline. EMC scored on a
penalty kick, but the issue was
decided by then.

_ fluence on the outcome of the

fired-up group as they returned
home to face Radford, but they
seemed intimidated from the
start and dropped a 2-1 decision.

The lack of a supportive
crowd seemed to deflate the
Generals’ enthusiasm. “I ad-
mit, we were pretty disap-
pointed,’’ said Coach Rolf Pira-
nian. ‘‘Here we had a really big
game at home, and they had
more fans than we did. We had
a letdown.”’

allowed to stand, despite vehe-
ment protest from W&L.

Piranian, however, refused to
blame the officiating for the
loss, ‘We beat ourselves” he
said simply.

Commentary:

by Ralph Frasca

“ True hustler.” ‘“‘The key to
the soccer team’s offense.” ‘An
athlete whose desire is reflected
in his intense, inspired play.”
This glowing praise has been
reserved for Roland Simon, the
freshman sparkplug of a fre-
quently dynamic offensive at-
tack which, teamed with the
“No goal Patrol’’ defense, nas
proved a formidable opponent
to its Old Dominion Athletic
Conference foes.

Simon was showered with ac-
colades during his high school
years, notably his election to
the first team All-State team
while laboring for Edgewood
High in Maryland, which he
described as a ‘‘decent team.”
Simon helped Edgewood reach
the state playoff for each four
years at that school. As of this
writing, the Generals sport a 4-2
record, spearheaded by goals
from Simon.

“Our offense started off slug-
gishly,” he relates, ‘‘but once
we got accustomed to playing
together, we gained the
cohesiveness we needed. We
have a lot of potential, and we’ll
continue to improve. With a
young team, there’s no telling
how far we’ll go.”’

Simon takes great care to
praise the defense, which he
feels is the big key to the offen-
sive attack. ‘“‘We have a very
strong defense, and _ they
deserve recognition. I like to
think that when I score a goal,
I’m thanking the defense for do-
ing such a good job.”

Coach Rolf Piranian, a defen-
sive player during his years at
W&L, is largely responsible for
the Generals’ tight defense,

which only Wesleyan has
permeated with notable suc-
cess. Simon laments, “I respect
Rolf’s intensity, but I wish he
was more knowledgeable about
the offensive aspects of the
game so that he could help me
improve.”

Simon came to W&L with the
intention of playing for a small
school, where he could achieve
some degree of recognition.

‘‘Although the odds are against
it, it would be the ultimate goal
to play professionally. But I’m
not holding that as my only op-
tion.”’ Towards that end, Simon
intends to major in Physics or
Engineering.

The young soccer team is
already looking towards gain-
ing an NCAA bid. Continued im-
provement by the offense and
steady play by the defense may
just earn them the bid. But, as
Simon warns, ‘‘there’s always
next year. With only three up-
perclassmen starting, the
nucleus of our team will be
together for a long time. We'll
be knocking on some doors,
that’s for sure.”’

Water Polo Back On Track
With Three Weekend Wins

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
returned to form last weekend
with three lopsided victories
and one close defeat in the first
half of the Southern Conference
Tournament. The Generals
trounced Georgia Southern 9-0,
J.M.U. 11-2, and Virginia 10-2,
before finally losing to Duke 9-7
in their final game of the
weekend.

The Georgia Southern
triumph demonstrated a
tremendous defensive effort by
the Generals; a shutout in a
fast-paced and volatile game
like water polo is always an im-
pressive achievement.

The fine defensive play con-
tinued through the James
Madison and U. Va. games, but
despite the Generals’
dominance, they lacked the
“killer instinct”? to make the
games as far out of proportion
as they might have been. In
either game, W&L could have
come away with twenty or
twenty-five goals.

This inability to capitalize on
scoring opportunities and turn
them into an insurmountable
lead may have been the reason
for the Generals’ one loss of the
weekend. After moving ahead
toa 5-2 lead, W&L was unable to
put the game on ice, as they
allowed the Blue Devils to come
back and win at the wire.

Coach Remillard feels that
his young team learned its
lesson from the Duke game, and
that the problem with intensity
is now a thing of the past. He
says that the Generals’ are
“hungry”? now, and that they
are ready to do the thing that
W&L water polo teams dream
about every year: beating Rich-

After last weekend’s half of
the conference tourney, Rich-
mond is in first place at 4-0, and
W&L and Duke are tied for se-
cond at 3-1. The second half of
the tournament will be played
at W&L on Oct. 24, 25, 26, and if
the Generals can beat Rich-
mond, who defeated Duke by a
one point margin, they have a
reasonable chance of winning
the conference.

Individual standouts for the
Generals last weekend included
Freshman goalie Andy Gates,
who put on an impressive show

classmate Tim Rock, who con-
tinues to make his presence
more and more apparent.

Perhaps the most encourag-
ing sign for the W&L.squad was
the play of junior captain Mike
Bernot, who seems to have
regained his shooting form.
Bernot scored on four out of
eight shots against Duke and
was impressive in the other
games.

This coming weekend the
Generals will play at home on

decided team, Richmond’s B

date puts pressure on the student’s sex-
ual importance, his masculinity.’’

It is for this reason, according to Dr.
Worth, that heavy drinking increases
before and during dating.

“Lots of meaningful experiences are
eroded because of drinking, and this is
one of the losses.

‘And probably lots of good sex, too.”’

The psychologist counsels only a hand-
ful of students each year exclusively for
alcohol-related problems, but he has
seen it as a direct and dangerous threat.
Last year one of his counselees had to
drop out of school and go toa sanitarium.

“Drinking is so overemphasized, while
the inherent dangers aren’t confronted,”’
Dr. Worth says.

‘And there is massive denial at
Washington & Lee. Denial is the major
problem.”’

Indirectly, he finds many of the others
who confer with him can trace their pro-
blems to drinking. ‘‘Alcohol creates
sneaky delusions,” he explains. “The
student can’t cope as well, but its very
subtle, and consequently he ends up hurt-
ing his program, social or academic.”’

And, of course, one of the greatest
hazards of alcohol abuse is not the im-
mediate one: alcoholism later in life. Dr.
Worth points to statistics which indicate
that one out of 12 dr, according to some

figures, one of nine, persons who drink

 

will be alcoholics or have drinking pro-
blems in the future. Those are conser-
vative figures, he adds. Applied to W&L,
a fraternity of 36 or 48 imbibers will pro-
duce three or four chronic drinkers.
There is no panacea, no cure-all, for
alcohol abuse, but Dr. Worth feels that

Alcoholism is a concern at Washington and Lee.

the university should at least take a role
in alcohol education. “I’m not ad-
vocating a holier-than-thou approach,
but the school should promote a model of
healthy use of alcohol. There absolutely,
absolutely should be more alcohol educa-
tion — there is nothing I know of now.”

 

pus Alcoholism

He is certain that awareness is the key,
and would like to see a W&L program in
conjunction with other schools; he envi-
sions a series of speakers, films and
discussions, with students contributing to
the planning.

“The education would not only be to
help students themselves, but to teach
them how to deal with the problems of
friends or family members.

“It’s a compassionate thing to do.”

But excessive and rampant drinking is
a dilemma not easily solved on the col-
lege campus. The University of Virginia,
legendary home of the serious drinker,
several years ago took measures to curb
the glut of revelling, abolishing the enor-
mous Mad Bow] bashes of Easters and
imposing other party restrictions. Yet a
story in the Richmond Times-Dispatch
last Sunday reports that little has chang-
ed, and the words of one U.Va. student
could quite easily be the testimony of his
W&L counterpart:

“It’s not just accepted, it’s encourag-
ed. Go to any party, at a fraternity or
football game or wherever, and some-
one’s always saying, ‘“‘Come on, have
another drink.’

‘Nobody cares if you get drunk. That’s
kind of expected; ...and the next morning
your friends all laugh about it, and, you
know, everyone thinks it’s funny, it’s
cool...”’

Lexingtonians Talk About Fraternities

by Will Jackson

Beer cans, plastic cups, 3
a.m. howls, squealing tires, pro-
fanity, the occasional trampled
flower bed, ‘“‘be young, be
foolish, but be happy’ again
and again and again...these are
some of the annoyances Lex-
ington residents who live near
fraternity houses have com-
plained of. In almost every
case, though, these irritations
are reduced by one over-riding
fact — friendship.

Older, life-long Lexington

residents seem to particularly
enjoy the proximity of the
fraternities, having been ac-
customed to college life for

Lee Avenue resident
years, and having gradually
become usedto the increasing
noise levels.

‘“‘Why, we chose to live here!”
said Mrs. Guy Agnor, who lives
with her husband, a 1918 W&L
graduate, in a house on Jackson
Avenue, in the former backyard
of Phi Gamma Delta. ‘‘We knew
the boys were there. We loved
them — we still do. They’ve
been lovely to us.”’

For Mrs. Ralph Daves there

 

was no such choice of residence,
but she has no regrets. She was
born at 110 Lee Avenue, two
doors down from Delta Tau
Delta, where she and her hus-
band still live. ‘“We’ve lived
very comfortably between the
fraternities for 55 years,’ said
Mrs. Daves, “‘and I have all my
life, of course.”

The Daves met while he was
playing football at W&L during
the winning years of the mid-
1920’s. According to Mrs.
Daves, her husband, originally
from Tennessee, ‘‘was going to
go to VMI but he felt that it look-
ed to much like a — well, you
can guess!’’ They married after
Mr. Daves graduated in the
class of ’26.

Another long-term resident of
the SPE/Fiji/Delta neigh-
borhood is Mrs. Scott Huger,
who echoed the sentiments. of
most of her. neighbors, saying,

“We've always had a pleasant

relationship — the boys are
friendly and very nice.’’ She
complained of parking lot noise,
but added that she figured that
was probably unavoidable.
bably unavoidable.

Younger residents of the area
were a little more specific in
their gripes.

One, the mother of school age
children, mentioned Wednes-
day night parties as her major
source of irritation. “It’s very
hard on those of us who have to
get up early to go to work or get
the children off to school,’’ she
explained.

She also noted expletive-
yelling and noise levels as ir-
ritants. ‘I detest rock music. I
listen mostly to classical and
bluegrass. It seems to me they
could do more to close windows
in the spring and fall.” Still, she
added, “‘They’re fairly good
neighbors — basically they’re
very considerate.”’

And things are improving, ac-
cording to this woman and some
of her neighbors. One man cited
his relief that fraternities were

learning to turn their speakers
in, rather than facing out of, the
windows. Also mentioned was a
reduction in post-party and
parking lot noise, particularly
so far this year. “‘A lot depends
on who are the presidents and
officers of the houses,” said
another neighborhood mother.
“If they make an effort, so do

but with certain reservations.
Mr. A. B. Claytor, who lives
next door to Phi Psi maintains a
general laissez-faire policy
regarding his neighbors. ‘“‘I
don’t bother them and they
don’t bother me,”’ he said. ‘‘The
fellows are honest and I like
their good will.’”’ But, Mr.
Claytor added, “If you go

 

‘T wish they’d get some new

records! They’ve been playing the

same two ever since we came here.’

the neighbors.”

One of the newest residents of
Jackson Avenue, Mary Visin-
tainer, who moved to Lexington
from Virginia Beach a month
ago said she and her husband
have encountered no real pro-
blems since Rush. ‘Then, the
noise bothered us because we
were just moving in.” And, she
said, ‘‘I do mind the fast driving
late at night, the cars squealing
around the corner.’’ But her
real complaint? “I wish they’d
get some new records! They’ve
been playing the same two ever
since we came here!”’

In another section of town, in
the vicinity of SAE, Pi Phi, and
Phi Psi houses, residents were
similarly ambivalent in their
feelings toward their youthful
neighbors, generally tolerant,

As for noise, Mr. Claytor said,

cups which find their way into
policy his yard are more of an
annoyance for Mr. Claytor. ‘I
have a bad back,” he says,
‘‘and I just don’t feel like pick-
ing them up!’’ The consumed
contents of the cups pose
another problem. ‘‘Sometimes
it seems to me the fellows take
on a little too much,” he said,
citing examples of people driv-
ing around and around fraterni-
ty houses or threatening to
jump from their roofs.

“In a way, I thought they

Mr. Claytor, who figured in

Alpha Epsilon, has a friendly
attitude toward the fraternity
members. This is understan-

Lexingtonians And Their Fraternity Neighbors

(continued from page 9)
the fraternity dates stay in his
house on weekends, but his
bedroom is on the back of the
house, protected from most er-
rant amplified chords.

The noise, in Mr. Wayland’s
opinion, isn’t much of a problem
“except is someone sounds like
they’re in trouble — a girl
screaming at 3 a.m. or
something. You know, anything
could be happening.”’

Mr. Wayland is a good friend
to the girls who spend weekends
in his house, some of whose
mothers stayed there when Mr.
Wayland first opened in the
mid-1950’s. The role of protector
and confidant is one which Mr.
Wayland obviously enjoys, even
though it monopolizes a lot of
his time. As an example, he
said, ‘‘Last Sunday was the first
time I’d been to church since
school started in September
—I’ve had to look after my
chicks!”

Mr. Wayland’s fraternity
neighbors seem to have as
much respect for him as he has
for them and their dates. With a
grin, Mr. Wayland said, “The
boys know I won’t put up with
any foolishness.” Indeed, in Mr.
Wayland’s house, they never

get past the first floor. .

Another resident of the
SAE/Phi Psi/Pi Phi
neighborhood expressed her
views on life among frats. ‘‘I
like all the boys,’’ she said.
“Taken individually, there’s no
one nicer — but that godawful
music!’’ ‘‘Wild animals’? was
her term for fraternity
members — en masse — on par-
ty nights. ‘‘And the girls,’”’ she
added, ‘‘the girls are worse
than the boys! All that squeal-

ing!”’
Not an objector to partying in
general, however, she sug-

gested that the trouble with
W&L fraternity parties is that
they simply go on too long. And
she hastened to add that some
weekends were exceptions to

the rule of rowdiness.
“This weekend,”’ she said sly-
ly, “will be heaven — it’s

Parents Weekend, you know!”’
Among townspeople _ in

general and among faculty who
live near fraternities (as on
University Place near Red
Square) in particular, a ,akpr
spirce of irritation is the
Wednesday night parties, a fair-
ly recent innovation in fraterni-
ty life. Professors seem to have
a real aversion to facing half-
empty classes and dozing or
pointedly hung-over students on
Thursdays.

Still, the attitude among Lex-

ington residents appears to be
that the fraternities, despite
their tendency to aggravate in-
somnia, are an integral part of
the W&L, and Lexington, com-
munity. Few advocate the
social lodge idea, and most
seem to enjoy life among frater-
nities, except perhaps on party
nights. In fact, Mrs. Agnor said,
“I’m sorry the fraternities are
having such a hard time. Phi
Gam’s so quiet this year we
kind of miss it!”’

Newcomb Renovation Set

(continued from page 1)
W&L’s resident architect, will
execute the detailed plans for
the project. The __ initial
Newcomb Hall space studies
were prepared by the Rich-
mond firm of Marcellus Wright,
Cox & Ladd, under the direction
of Frederic M. Cox, a partner in
that firm. Cox and the firm
have been W&L’s chief ar-
chitects in all its recent building
improvements and construction
projects.

Newcomb was completed in
1882 at a cost of just $20,000
—the gift of ‘‘a friend at the
North,” as a contemporary
chronicle described Mrs. War-
ren Newcomb. The portico and
columns were added in 1909. In
1936 the building was renovated
and fireproofed.

Originally the college library
and art building, Newcomb was
designated the home of the

nomics and Politics when that
division -was added to the
university in 1906. The com-
merce unit remained there until
last month, when a $3.5-million
renovation of McCormick,
W&L’s former library building,
was completed.

Newcomb has more than
11,500 square feet of usable floor
space. The four departments
which will move into it in 1981
are now scattered across the

whole W&L Front Campus, in-
cluding in the two antebellum
residences north of the Colon-
nade — the result of severe
overcrowding throughout
W&L’s undergraduate divisions
in recent years. In the
philosophy department alone,
as an example, which has just
five faculty members, offices
are currently spread among
two academic buildings and one
of the houses.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Student Alcoholism

There are many fine traditions at Washington and
Lee. These traditions of academic excellence and
honesty are good for the University and good for the
students. But it seems that another tradition is finally
becoming associated with Washington and Lee — the
reputation of a hard drinking school. We certainly
support the spirit of hard partying, but we do not want
to see W.C. Fields included on the Universlty Seal.

Lexington’s Law
Enforcement

It would seem that some action on Lexington’s law
enforcement problem is coming to stem the tide of
violence sweeping the town. Lexingtonians are pro-

bably just as outraged as we are about the situation. -

Doubtless few students or their parents would sit back
and watch law and order deteriorate in their own
home towns.

We’ve heard Monty Briscoe pledge that he will ad-
dress the problem in The Ring-tum Phi and The
News-Gazette. Student body Vice President Willy
Mackey has also written a letter (see page 13).
Earlier this week IFC faculty adviser Holt Merchant
suggested that the IFC leadership meet with Mayor
Charles Phillips and city- council member Thomas
Imeson. Merchant stressed the value of utilizing ex-
isting ‘“‘channels.”’

Well, we call that a good start and nothing more.
The University can mount the kind of campaign need-
ed to spur the town to action as no group of students
could. And yet, we’ve seen many student causes die in
“channels.” The lack of law enforcement in Lex-
ington affects students — students are being robbed
and beaten in the streets, not faculty members.
Students have the responsibility to make their sen-
timents heard and see that corrective measures are
enacted — the University should be receptive and
helpful.

Yes, this year crime in Lexington’s streets is a stu-
dent problem — next year it will be the University’s.

Student Sick Of Misconceptions

Dear Editor:

I am one of the women so elo-
quently described in the article
in the October 2, 1980 issue of
the Ring-tum Phi entitled ‘‘On
the Road to Sweet Briar — A
Freshman’s Guide.” I, for one,
am sick of defending myself
against misconceptions about
Sweet Briar and its students,
but I am afraid I can not let this
slanderous piece go by without
some response.

left? AH!, but there was some-

thing else. It was not hard to
miss sexual implications. (This

Spectator And Mommy

“Oh no...mummy is coming tomorrow.” You
can hear the wail and how! all across campus as
young men cry these words and prepare for the
torturous festivities. Mummy is no Hollins girl,
and there is no rush of expectant bliss as our
mourning friends change fertile bedding. They
shower, shave and actually wipe their derrieres.
Cherished literature is devoured one last time and
stashed under the bed. Then, with prudent
foresight, it’s stashed under the roommate’s
pillow. Every precaution is taken to ensure and
preserve the angelic innocence that is expected
and so very, very valuable.

For money listens to the good and ignores the
drunken, the slovenly; money ignores the real
you. Each sock left in the corner is worth a six-
pack; each shirt a case; each bra your in-
heritance. This is the law of economics and you
don’t need a college education to figure it out. A
can of Lysol is the secret to a toke-master’s suc-
cess.

But what do you do with her once she shows up?
How do you escape? You can’t make her do your
homework anymore...she won’t understand it. Six
meals on Saturday at each of Lexington’s

gastronomic catastrophies?. .No, .no.,.Take ~her.

down to your fraternity house. Endear her to your
brothers, the house’s poverty, and your own. But
most of all, get her wasted! Flood her with Jack
Daniels and fill her with exotic brownies. Remind
her of your professor’s generous comments. Go
for it.

-Books were really expensive, mom. And I get a
haircut every week now. Not to mention the laun-
dry bills and the cost of a beer or two on week-
ends. And you remember how all the guys took you
out on super dates when you were in school, don’t
you mom? Well, a couple hundred dollars ought to
hold me for a while.

-Promise me you’ll be good, sonny,

-Oh, of course, mom, you know I’d never do
anything wrong. And I’ll even drive you to your
hotel.

You dig deeper into your pockets; you fumble
for words...wanting to escape, but caught by the
charm of her jewels, the warmth of her furs. And
there in the corner is the blond you desire, but you
can’t blow your mother off. Your girl flirts with
your brothers; you wink but she ignores you. Mom
won’t leave; she’s dazzled by the dean; she’ll
write the check tomorrow. Mothers are a pain, but
be sure.to clean the seeds off your desk. ....

Dear Editor:

In the midst of the storm of ©

bromides and cliches descend-
ed upon us by the government
and’ its myriad of statist in-
tellectuals ‘and apologists im-
ploring us to vote, it is clear that
a more radical analysis of the
issue involved is called for.

(Radical — “‘p:oceeding from
the root...f::ndamental‘‘
Webster’s). Wi ‘s it so wor-

risome to the , _rnment that

The issue invol\ ed is known as

root of fundamental principle

—totally subservient to the
sovereign individuals of the na-
tion — whose only proper func-
tion is to protect the rights and
property of those individuals
from violent infringement, for

including the government itself.

A 200 year history of switched
definitions, distorted concepts,

An Alternative—

a government that is the great-
est single violator of individual.
right this country has ever
known. The government which

presently reigns over us has

developed, from a competent
guardian of legal justice which
impartially protects the
freedom and property of all
men because they are men and
these are their inalienable
rights, to a system designed to
sell to any person(s), for the
price of the favor of some
bureaucrat or 51% of some
mob, the “right” to “legally”
violate the rights of any other
person(s) via the use of govern-
ment coercion — direct or im-
plied. And in order to protect its
own power and security, the
government has and will violate

the rights of any and all.

In an article, telling us to
vote, of last week’s Ring-tum
Phi, we are fed, as an alleged
reason to vote, the slogan:
“Take time for America.’’ But
the fact is that this is already
done for us — coercively and
regardless of our consent — by
U.S. governments. For years
Americans have had their time
taken from them — ‘“‘for
America.’’ Today state and
federal governments force the
average American to spend 30%
of his working time on paying

Police Shortcomings Cited

Dear Sirs: .

In view of the. following facts,
I feel compelled to speak out.

Fact: Numerous _ students
have been assaulted and in
some instances injured in the
past month.

Fact: Many fraternities con-
tinue to be the target of inten-
sive police efforts to enforce the
discretionary ‘noise or-
dinance’; in some cases police
have delivered summonses to
individuals in their own rooms
for use of personal stereos.

Fact: At 1:15 a.m. Sunday,
October 4th four Lexington
policeman were seen (by
myself and others) drinking
coffee and playing pinball at
Hop-In; evidently they were
oblivious to the fact that the
12:30 a.m. — 2 a.m. period has
been a high crime. incident
period.

I believe that both students
and the town’s police force have
a responsibility in maintaining
a peaceful and safe environ-
ment. Our job is to ensure
responsible conduct for both
ourselves as well as for others.
The police’s job is, at the very
least, to provide effective objec-
tive protection to the town’s in-
habitants.
some instances of student
misconduct, I wager that no one

    
    
    
  

Ww e

 

has been injured or harmed in
any way by it. I cannot say the
same with respect to the con-
spicuous failure on the part of
the police to do their job. Both
the two-bit hoodlums and their
victims have surely been well
aware of this failure. As
misordered as the police
priorities evidently are (placing
noise enforcement above
physical security), the very
least they should do is realize
that we have common interests
in safety, that students aren’t
here to make their life
miserable, and that it is their
professional duty to ‘serve and
protect’ all town inhabitants.

What can we do, then, in the
face of both official harrass-
ment and negligence? A few
thoughts are offered:

1) We must act the better
man; give them no basis for
their oft repeated assertion that

“students have no regard for
the law.”

2) Support student efforts

pressing for poties sicoiktblli
ty and objective standards in
enforcement of laws. Most
specifically, a case is pending
which questions the lack of any
definable guidelines for en-
forcement of the noise or-
dinance (i.e., decibel meters):

3) Make a special effort to
travel in groups and help those
who need company or. protec-
tion.

4) Finally, don’t give up and
resign yourself to
‘vigilanteism.’ It will only
backfire. If you thought Officer
communities fare well enough
with students in their midst. I
dangerous.

It is sad to note how other
communities fair well enough
with students in their midst. I
believe that we must examine
ourselves and our actions, but
we should expect no less from
others.

Response To Freshman’s Guide

To the Editor:

It is likely that the article en-
titled “‘The Freshman Guide:
On The Road to Sweet Briar”’ of
October 2, 1980, that appeared
in The Ring-tum Phi was meant
to be slightly tongue-in-cheek.
Foot-in-mouth however, would
be a better description.

Sir, the Phi might consider
“the Bush (emphasis added) to
be a good road trip, maybe the
best,”’ but to us it’s a fine place
of higher education whose great
good fortune it is to be located
on the most beautiful 3,300
acres this side of the Blue Ridge
Mountains. (We are certain that

Students, yes women, at
Sweet Briar will be the first to
acknowledge the College’s iso-
lation. This isolation, plus the
large female population at the
school, unhappily necessitates
certain restrictions on the stu-
dent body, the need for tight
security being foremost among
them. Precautions, although
sometimes bothersome, are
most definitely in the students’
best interest. The security may
be the target of jokes both at
Sweet Briar and surrounding
colleges; but assuredly if a

tragedy should occur because of
its absence, this lack of security
would be no laughing matter.
Continuing with the same no-
tion of security, especially in
the dorms, we would like to cor-
rect the phantom authors of this
piece, as they casually state,
‘should you be_ talked

authors’ imaginations but
believe a more accurate state-
ment of the situation would be
that male students, “men,”
become temporary roommates

double (emphasis added) beds..
In general, we wish we could
thank the authors for their
almost begrudging compliment
to our College. However, we
cannot sit back and allow cheap
shots to be leveled at our Col-

being ‘‘closer than you think”’ in
the dormitory can be translated
to the female counterpart of
looking like dinner mints in pink
button-down and khakis and
having a gay atmosphere at
men’s college. These aspersions
only serve to alienate Sweet

other and as a consequence call
into jeopardy the truly valuable

they would summarily take all
of our time via military con-

by strict dictionary definition,
forms of slavery; they are
characteristics of totalitarian
governments and among the
favorite tools of our supposed
ideological opposite, the Soviet
Union. That we should then be
told to take more of our time
and use it to give our sanction to
those who would so criminally
destroy our society and the lives

it is a blatant step in the faces of
reason and justice.

For, you see, our vote is

is our statement that we agree
to and morally sanction the
fundamental form, principles
and. actions by which that
government functions and that
we simply wish to choose the
particular men to carry out
those functions. If Americans
can give their consent to such a
flagrantly criminal and
destructive institution, then
they deserve the totalitarian,
Slave regime which the ruthless
logic of justice will surely visit
upon us all. But although de-
struction is a basic alternative
which any person may choose
for himself, no one has the right
to make that choice for another.
Do not help criminal govern-
ments to pretend, to themselves
and to others, that their
malevolent activity has the
sanction of its victims. Clearly
so small a minority can
perpetrate such atrocities on so
large a majority only by such a
sanction — even if it is a sanc-
tion by default. If you truly care
for America — for what it once

human liberty, then do not vote

dignation at slavery practiced

in human society. It is our only

Police Outrage Fraternities,
Ad Hoc Report Discussed

(continued from page 1)
‘“‘ways” to avoid a noise or-
dinance conviction, citing an in-
stance in which the Pi Kappa
Alpha fraternity retained a
lawyer to represent them in
court and the case was
‘postponed indefinitely.’’

Uther representatives ex-
pressed outrage over violent in-
cidents occurring near fraterni-
ty houses. Briscoe reported that
he knew of an instance in which
several outsiders allegedly
threatened people at the Sigma
Nu fraternity house and created
a “potentially very dangerous
situation’ which resulted in a
brick being thrown through a
house window. Briscoe added
that the Sigma Nus notified the
police and were told an officer
would investigate the com-
plaint, but no officer arrived.

IFC faculty adviser Holt Mer-
chant assured the Council that
the Lexington community ‘‘is
beginning to understand that we
have a law enforcement prob-
lem” and that ‘‘students are
often the victims of crimes, not
the perpetrators.””. Merchant
suggested that the IFC meet
with Lexington Mayor Phillips
to discuss the problem. ‘‘I don’t
think they understand the
magnitude of the problem” he
said.

Earlier in the -meeting

Hbbhhbbhhdohhodhhhhhhs

Briscoe asked for comments on
the recommendations of the
Report of the Ad Hoc Commit-
tee on Fraternities.

Phi Delta Theta President
Hill Macalester stated that the
implementation of the Report’s
Option C would ‘‘ruin fraternity
life and detract from the
University.”’

A representative from ZBT
stated that he considered his
fraternity to be ‘‘more than just
a place to gather socially,’’ and
that the implementation of Op-

tion C ‘‘would destroy »

something that is really great

and a benefit to the school.”’

Briscoe added that many of
the Report’s criticisms . of
fraternities centered around
house finances and urged
fraternity representatives to
“get in gear.’’ Briscoe also urg-
ed fraternity members to
“make suggestions and recom-
mendations through the Univer-
sity Council,’ which will
discuss fraternities in_ its
November 20 meeting. ‘I’ve
seen the IFC act apathetic in
the past, and the University did
just what it pleased. We should
at least address the issue.”’

E.C. Dismisses WLUR Survey

by Cope Moyers

A motion that would have
allowed the Executive Commit-
tee to conduct a controversial
survey about music programm-
ing at W&L’s student radio sta-
tion WLUR, failed at Monday
night’s EC meeting.

EC member Jim Vines said
he wanted the EC to conduct the
survey about the radio station’s .
programming after hearing
several complaints by students
about the quality of programm-
ing at the station. But after a
lengthy discussion on the com-
mittee’s jurisdiction in the mat-
ter, the motion failed 7-3. Vines,
Tripp Brower and Willie
Mackie voted in favor of the mo-
tion.

Vines said the motion was not
an attempt to regulate WLUR’s

programming but was instead
aimed at getting more student
input into some of the musical
programming.

“I don’t believe enough time
is being spent by the station in
recruiting students to work at
the station,”’ Vines said.

Vines said the survey would
have been conducted during
winter registration in the
registrar’s office and possibly
during this week’s freshmen
elections. The questionnaire
was to be in three parts, asking
students if they were happy
with afternoon programming
and classical music program-
ming. The third question would
have asked students who were
interested in working for WLUR
for their names and phone
numbers, which would then
have been turned over to the
station.

But several WLUR staff
members and a few EC

NUMBER 6

Sea Level Replaces
NRPS;Weekend Set

by Frank Billingsley

Sea Level, a jazz-rock band
from Macon, Georgia, will
replace the New Riders of the
Purple Sage as Homecoming’s
main attraction at the Friday
night concert in Doremus Gym-
nasium.

Last Thursday night the New
Riders of the Purple Sage, a
five-man group out of San Fran-
cisco, called the SAB to cancel
their engagement for Friday’s
homecoming concert. The band
was in studio recording an
album and fell behind schedule.
They felt that their album took
priority over the engagement.

What is the normal reaction
of a Student Activities Board co-
chairman when the homecom-
ing band cancels out a week
before the engagement? ‘‘Your
heart tremors,’’ Says co-
chairman Pryse Elam, and he
should know. ‘‘We had original-
ly wanted Sea Level, but they
were too expensive. They’ve
come down in price and we are
very happy about getting
them,” Elam said. Sea Level
dropped the price from $7,500 to
$5,600.

The New Riders of the Purple
Sage were not legally bound to
play at W&L because no written
contract had been finalized.
‘“‘We had the New Riders book-
ed, not contracted. All they
broke was a verbal agree-

ment,” Elam said.

The SAB had mailed the final,
signed contract Thursday mor-
ning, but by then it was too late
because NRPS already cancell-
ed. There were 68 sections and
riders that had to be approved
by co-chairman Jamie Small,
Advisor Mike Capetto, and
Elam. Details of a dressing
room for the band and adequate
power could not be finalized un-
til Wednesday night.

Elam said that last minute
cancellations are not terribly
uncommon in the music field.
“It happens, you just hope it
doesn’t happen to you,”’ he said.

Elam said he was ‘‘shocked’’
when he learned that the New
Riders had cancelled out. “I
was particularly worried that
homecoming would be a failure
and that we wouldn’t have a
band. But Sea Level is excellent
and we anticipate one of the
best homecomings ever,” he
said.

Will Elam buy the New
Riders new album when it is
finally released? ‘‘If it’s any
good,’’ he said casually.

The concert begins at 8:00
tomorrow night in Doremus
Gymnasium. Skip Castro will
play as warm-up band followed
by Sea Level. No beverages of
any kind will be served and
smoking will be confined to the
lobby area. Admission is free.

G-L Renovation Will Cause Problems

by Edward Gonsalves

Student’s regard the Univer-
sity’s proposed renovation plan
as an inconvenience, yet at the
same time see a necessity for
the renovation.

“The renovation will increase
conflicts next year,” says Jake
Purcell, head dormitory
counselor, ‘‘But there is no

alternative, Graham-Lees
should be renovated.

Next year, Davis, Gilliam and
Baker Dormitories will be oc-
cupied by displaced freshmen.
The three dormitories accor-
ding to William Hartog, Dean of
Admissions for the University,
will hold 280 students next year,

as we do in every other area of
Washington and Lee life, for
students to develop a sense of
responsibility for their own af-
fairs. That. is a part of the
educational philosophy of this

University, as I think you know
well.

We know, and have always
known, that students who leave
here will be expected by a dif-
ficult and uncertain world to
cope with the problems and

temptations that will confront
them, the digressions that will
always be at their feet. We
know they will be expected to
develop a sense of responsibili-
ty and will be expected to
discharge it as soon as they
leave these walls. Our effort has
always been and will continue
to be to expose our students to
as large a measure of respon-
sibility as they can take.

this year’s residents. The
Robert E. Lee Hotel will occupy
approximately 70 students.

“Many problems will occur
next year besides problems of
conduct,” claims Ken Lang, a
Gilliam dormitory counselor.
‘Complaints will be made, and
rightfully so, about the limited
closet and bathroom space.”’

But Frank Parsons, assistant
to the president of the Universi-
ty, believes that the renovation
won’t cause too many pro-
blems. ‘Single rooms are a
norm for this school. But at any
other school doubles are stan-
dard accommodations for
freshmen. In Gilliam Dor-
mitory, some freshmen will be
sharing rooms as small as 13 x
9. Due to the doubling of every
room, there will be eighteen
freshmen for every two
showers.

“In Davis and Baker Dor-
mitory the situation is similar,

Huntley Remarks On WE&L

...We need to keep a sharp
focus on the central purpose for
which this school exists — on
the increasingly critical impor-
tance of the liberal arts in the
world into which our students
will be graduated. In this day of
increasing specialization, it
seems to me that this is
especially important for pre-
professional and _ pre-business
students, as most of our
students are.

We have always sought and
will increasingly strive to pro-
vide the kinds of pre-
professional offerings that will
introduce them to the profes-
sions and careers upon which
they may embark when they
leave us. But our effort is not to
use those kinds of programs to
supplant the liberal arts or as
an alternative to the liberal
arts. These kinds of programs,
as we see it, must be taught and
structured into our curriculum
as complements to — indeed as
part of — the liberal arts objec-
tive.

Our intention here is to have a
small academic community
Where curriculum and views
are diverse but where there is a
shared commonality of purpose
about the broad reach of the
future of our ideals; where ex-
cellence and trust in each other
and respect for differences of
opinion can exist harmonious-
ly; where vitriol and jealousy
are ata minimum.

 

HUFFMAN’S
Florist & Greenery

We want the young people
who leave here to emerge with
tough minds, with confidence in
their own ability to meet the
future: the kind of self-
confidence that is born of the
rigorous academic standards
Washington and Lee retains anc
intends to strengthen; born of
the confrontations our students
have here with personal deci-
sions about their lives — and the
values in their lives.

We want them to have the
ability to be trusting without be-
ing naive; to be confident
without being arrogant; to be
tolerant without being con-
descending — to be strong-
minded and humble at the same
time. Those are lofty ideals, and
they are not new ones for this in-
stitution. We do not intend to

abandon them; especially do we
not intend to abandon them in
these days. We shall never
wholly achieve them, of course;
but we shall continue to strive
for them.

(Our students) are the only
reason Washington and Lee is in
existence. What occurs to them
after they leave us is the only
test that matters of whether
Washington and Lee is a suc-
cessful university. Do they
leave here with characteristics
of the kind I’ve just attempted
to describe? Can they cope with
the kinds of complexities life
will present to them? Can they
have the attributes of tough
minds, self-confidence and
humility that we think the world
requires of them?

We think they can.

The inconveniences that will

as something they will just have

EC member Willie Mackie
said the committee has a
responsibility to check into all
student affairs, including those
involving the radio station.

“It’s important to get discon-
tent into the open,’’ Mackie
said.

But WLUR General Manager
and professor Robert de Maria
reminded the committee that
the station is licensed by the
Federal Communications Com-
mission for Lexington and not
just the Washington and Lee
community.

“It is hard to program
because we’re trying to serve as
many as we can,’’ de Maria
said.

“Running the station is a jug-
gling act,’’ he added.

de Maria did encourage
students who have complaints
or suggestions to talk to him
directly. He also asked the Ex-
ecutive Committee to report

“If they don’t like what’s go-

Maria said.

In other business, the com-
mittee approved a motion by
Eric Myers that the EC form a
committee to investigate stu-
dent use and abuse of alcohol
for the purpose of ‘‘raising stu-
dent consciousness on alcohol
abuse.”’

Myers said many parents ex-
pressed concern last weekend
about alcoholism among
students, especially after a
story appeared in the Ring-tum
Phi. Myers, Marshall, Clark
and Frank Smith volunteered to
look into the problem.

The committee also heard the
monthly report from Contact,
which said it had scheduled
Senator Adlai Stevenson to
speak next Thursday. Senator
Richard Schweiker will speak
at W&L on November 3 and
economic reporter Irving R.
Levine will speak November 11.

M.D. Plans Underway

The third annual Superdance
for Muscular Dystrophy,
scheduled for February 6-8,
could be the most successful
ever. Last year the 30-hour
marathon raised over $18,000
toward helping those struck by
Muscular Dystrophy.

The goal this year is $20-
thousand dollars.

Co-chairman J. Hemby and
Tripp Brower are confident
that figure can be reached, in
part by the large turnout at the
first steering committee
meeting held Monday, October
20. They do‘say, however, that

the success of the marathon.

The unique attribute of this
charitable event is that it also
provides for entertainment for
all who participate.

Last year the marathon
featured 22 hours of live music
from some of the best bands in
the state. For $3, students could
listen to bands such as Trax,
Albatross, and the Bandales.
Also, 16-ounce beers sold for fif-

Probably few students con-
sider where their tuition money
goes after they finish paying all
the bills. How this money is us-
ed is important, however,
because it helps determine the
quality of education a student
receives.

As explained by Mr. Stewart
Epley, the University
treasurer, the money that
makes up Washington and Lee’s
revenues, all 13.4 million
dollars of it, is acquired in
several ways, Money from. tui-
tion, gifts, and endowments is

Tuition; Where Does It Go?

This money is spent accor-
ding to a budget that is
prepared the previous spring.
The budget is planned in a
series of steps starting when the
department heads present their
estimated expenditures for the
following year to their respec-
tive deans. The deans take
these estimates, trimming
them where they decide expen-
ditures are not necessary, and
give them to the president and
the treasurer.

These men then make
changes to the estimates that
they deem appropriate and
compare these estimates with
the expected revenues for the
coming year. The deans, presi-
dent and treasurer may still
make changes after these
numbers have been compared.

Up until several years ago, the
numbers for the estimates and
revenues always matched.
However, because of inflation,
the estimates for expenditures
have exceeded the expected
revenues for the past few years.
The difference between
revenues and expenditures is
made up by gifts that the
University does not receive on
an annual basis, such as money
that is donated to the University
as a gift in someone’s will. This
years total expenses came-to
$13,548,800. This created a total
deficit of $148,000 that was
made up by these special gifts.
The
University would not release
the amount that each depart-
ment receives. This policy ex-
ists, explained Mr. Epley, to
avoid any animosity “

On The Road To Hollins

If one is willing to endure an
interminably long drive down
Route 81, Hollins College lurks
in the outermost reaches of the
bustling metropolis of Roanoke,
waiting to smother the un-
suspecting freshmen in _ its
southern hospitality.

The security is not as op-
pressive as some of the other
girls’ schools, but this fact will
scarcely seem imporian. 9
discriminating Minks, as
‘Hollie Honeys,’’ more com-
monly known as “Hollie Col-
lies’’ amongst realistic
freshmen, are rarely worth the
effort to jeopardize one’s well-
being at the hands of security
guards.

However, should a persever-
ing Mink encounter a Collie who
is not of a flighty nature, he
may wish to go to the
Rathskeller, Hollins’ answer to
our beloved Cockpit.

No self-respecting freshman
could ever forget the infamous
“Hollins mixer.’’ This was the
eagerly-awaited reward for en-
during a veritable sea of
speeches during orientation
week. Hundreds of hungry
Minks descended upon the
school in search of attractive
females. Hollins girls are, by
and large, the prettiest of all to
be found in the surrounding
girls’ schools; however,
numerous male _ participants
complained of the despised
adversity, ‘‘the blow-off.’’

Regardless, many enjoyed
themselves, although the crowd
around the beer table was
almost impenetrable. . One
freshman commented,

‘Whenever I had half an hour to
waste, I waited in the beer
line.”

The campus parties are fre-
quent enough, although the beer
customarily runs short and the
dance hall is insufficient for
more than two dozen shaggers.
The campus is pleasant,
although lackluster. Tinker
Mountain looms menacingly on
one side, and there is a com-
manding view of numerous
truck stop greasy spoons on the
other.

There are three distinctive
features at Hollins this year. A
sizable number of Texas belles
have flocked to the school in
search of four years of higher
education. Also, many Collies
have a deep-rooted fetish for
horseback riding, although no
horses can be kept on the cam-
pus due to the fact that the

Savory, Peeper Will

Conduct Seminar Here

The Washington and Lee
University Concert Guild will
open its 1980-81 season Tuesday,
Oct. 28 with a performance by
British pianist John Savory at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Savory, who was born in Lon-
don and began his musical
education there under Herbert
Fryer, was a lecturer for
several years at Oxford Univer-
sity. In 1954 he decided to
devote his musical talents to the
piano and left to study at the
Vienna Conservatoire.

While there, Savory began
giving concerts throughout
Europe including Salzburg,
Barcelona, Madrid and
Florence. Upon his return to
London he began performing
for the English public and giv-
ing annual concert tours in the
United States, including
lecture-recitals and workshops
at many important American
universities.

His W&L performance will in-
clude works by Haydn, Mc-
Cabe, Cardew and Schubert.

  

Savory and Quinn Peeper, a
junior at W&L and president of
the Concert Guild, will conduct
a pre-concert seminar Monday,
Oct. 27, at 7:30 p.m. in duPont
102 at Washington and Lee. The
public is invited.

Tickets for the concert season
may be purchased at a cost of
$10 from Robert Stewart, pro-
fessor of music and head of the
music department at

Washington and Lee, or at the
door on the night of the perfor-
mance. Tickets may also be
purchased for single perfor-
mances at a cost of $3.

All classes are postponed for

Netmen Lose Twice
In W&L Invitational

by Phil Murray

The Generals’ 1980 Fall tennis
program ended Saturday ‘in a
rain-shortened match against
UVA after losing their first two
matches in the W&L Invita-
tional.

The netmen opened the tour-
nament Friday, losing to a
tough Maryland squad, 8-1.
Peter Lovell lost a tight match
with no. 1 Frank Apecechea 7-6
(5-4), 6-2, and fourth man Wes
Younge finally went down after
a long three-setter.

The only victory came in the
first flight doubles match,
Lovell and Doug Gaker combin-
ed to defeat the team of Myers
and Smith 74, 4-6, 7-5. Steve
Denny and Younge were also in-
volved in a close competition
but same up on the losing end,
5-7, 6-7.

On Saturday morning, as the
rain threatened the tourna-
ment, the Generals lost again to

Ohio, 7-2. Once again Lovell had
his usual fine match and handi-
ly defeated his opponent 6-4, 6-2.
Steve Denny also played well
but came up short, 6-3, 3-6, 1-6.

On the doubles courts, Lovell
and Gaker again turned in a
winning performance 6-4, 6-4
ending the program with a 4-2
record, with both losses coming
in three set matches.

Also noteworthy is the sur-
prising play of Freshman Scott
Berman who could open the
season in the five slot.

Coach Franke believes that
with practice and this in-
valuable experience against
Division I players, his team ean
come back to perform well in
the spring. Franke is especially
pleased with the play of Lovell
during the fall. Franke believes
Lovell has blossomed into a top-
notch’ singles and doubles
player.

Harriers Split Meets

by John Harrison
The W&L cross country team

went to Bridgewater last Fri- .

day uncertain how to approach
the meet with the Eagles.

With everyone back at full
strength after a strong showing
in the previous meet, in which
W&L defeated Norfolk State
and host Christopher Newport
but lost to Lynchburg, there
was cause to go into the fourth
meet of the season with an op-
timistic outlook.

On the other hand, W&L knew
that it would be facing the
toughest competition on their
schedule, Bridgewater being
one of the strongest teams in the
state.

It was no great surprise,
therefore, that Bridgewater
took first place, as the Eagles
had eight runners in the top
eleven spots. What was not an-
ticipated, however, was the way
in which the Eagles totally
dominated the meet, never
allowing the Generals a chance
to overtake them.

Sophomore Jon Kalafant was
the only W&L runner to finish
within a minute of the top spot.

Kalafant’s third-place clocking :

of 27:29 was 26 seconds off the
pace.

Freshman Angus McBryde
and senior co-captain Charlie
Warner, both of whom finished
more than a minute behind
Kelafant, completed the W&L
scoring with fifth and sixth
place finishes in the five-mile
event.

Coach Dick Miller offered a
rather blunt explanation for his
team’s unusually meager per-
formance, ‘‘We didn’t run very
intelligently. We _ let
Bridgewater get a huge lead in
the first few minutes and it was
impossible for us to make up for
.

From these observations, one
gets the feeling that it was a
combination of Bridgewater’s
sheer ability and W&L’s lower

Booters Win Twice As

Williams, Muskin Star

by Mark Schramm
It looks like there is a new
soccer power rising out of the
Shenandoah Valley, and its col-
ors are blue and white.

The Generals’ soccer team
continued to dominate its op-
position as sweeping both mat-
ches last week, first stomping
Gettysburg, 3-0, and then blank-
ing Pratt Institute 1-0, upping
their record to 6-2.

Bryan Williams’ two goals
were more than enough against
Gettysburg. Both teams were
sluggish at the outset and
neither took a distinct advan-
tage.

Midway through the period,
Williams was tripped in the
penalty area by a Gettysburg
defender. His penalty kick
skimmed just inside the post,
and W&L took a 1-0 halftime
lead.

The Generals picked up the
pace in the second half, and
their crisp passing and alert
play gave them several scoring
opportunities. It was outstan-
ding defensive play. However,
that led to their second goal.

As the Gettysburg forwards
lurked around Goalie Kirk
Mancer, Defender Tad Renner
stole the ball and lofted a clear-
ing pass to Midfielder Ben

Muskin. Muskin dished the ball
off to Craig Burns, and the
senior forward’s 25-yard blast
found the back of the net.

Bryan Williams got his se-
cond goal near the end of the
match. Ben Muskin er

another assist as he dropped a
perfect pass to the hustling co-
captain, who cooly placed a shot
in the upper left-hand corner.

The ‘‘No Goal Patrol’’ lived
up to its name as it frustrated
the Gettysburg offense
throughout- the game.
Defenders Tad Renner and
Mark Sullivan shared Player of
the Game awards.

A special award was given to
Goalie Keven Carney, whose
two first half saves broke the
W&L save record (383). As
usual, Carney down played his
role. “It’s nice to have the
record,” the veteran remarked,
“but it’s more important that
the team won. And don’t forget,
I’ve got a great defense in front
of me.”

Defense or not, it is still hard
to forget Mancer’s heroic play
of the past three years, when he
regularly faced 30 or more shots
a game. “I’d rather win,” is
how he puts it.

The Generals won their fifth
game in six tries as they beat
Pratt Institute, 1-0, on Bryan
Williams’ penalty kick goal.

W&L got off to their

customary slow start, but once
again it was the steady, cool-
headed play of Ben Muskin that

turned the tide for the Generals.
The Junior Midfielder, who best
resembles a bearded Franz
Beckenbauer, pushed his team-
mates upfield kept them calm

the Generals dominated, and
they had several scoring oppor-
tunities. Brad Poorman had two
shots stopped in front and
Roland Simon’s diving header

off a corner kick was punched
out,

Teamwork and determination
overcame the superior skills of
the Pratt squad, as Pratt did not
penetrate beyond the Generals’
18-yard line during the final 15
minutes of the half.

The second half continued as
the first, and it became only a
matter of time before the
Generals would score. Craig
Burns unleashed several strong
shots from his right wing slot,
and Player of the Game Chris
Daniel put a shot on goal while
sprawled on the ground after
being flattened by two
defenders.

Finally, Bryan Williams was
fouled in the penalty box, and he
softly nudged his Penalty Kick

inside the right post for his third
goal of the week.
While the Generals

dominated the rest of the way,
(outshooting Pratt 31-8), they
were unable to score another
goal.

“It was really frustrating,”
said Sweeper Peter Collins. .
‘We were all over their net, but
we just couldn’t push it in.’’ Ben
Muskin summed it up best when
he said, “It’s a killer when
you’re pounding on a door and it
won’t open for you.”’

W&L applied pressure until
the end, and Pratt managed on-
ly three serious offensive
thrusts in the second half.

While the fans acknowledged
the excellent play, the biggest
cheers of the day were saved for
the referee, who smartly. red-
carded a stray dog that
wandered onto the field.

Generals Beat H-SCE In Miracle Comeback |

by Dale Park
With only one quarter to play
and 13 points down, the

Washington and Lee varsity
football team erupted for seven-
teen fourth quarter points to
shock the _Hampden-Sydney
Tigers 17-13 last Saturday at
Wilson Field.

The win lifted the Generals’
overall record to 4-2 and raised
their ODAC mark to 2-1.
Hampden-Sydney, while losing
to W&L for the second straight
year, watched their record fall
to 2-4.

“At halftime I felt the team
was first,” said head coach
Gary Fallon. ‘‘We were doing a
bad job of tackling out there. On
offense we couldn’t get on track
— we were hurting ourselves
with penalties. Actually, we
were lucky that it was only 7-0
at the end of the half.”’

The Generals’ offense receiv-
ed outstanding second half per-
formance from some new and
old names.

Sophomore tailback Ken
Robinson carried the ball most
of the time during W&L’s late

third period scoring drive. On
the first play of the fourth
quarter Robinson dove into the
end zone from one yard out. The

Fit To Be

Tied

score cut the Sydney lead to
13-7.

Junior quarterback Rich
Hachenburg, replacing junior
Mike Wenke, teamed with
sophomore slot back Jerry
Thompson on several key pass
plays.

On third and twelve from the
W&L 42-yard line, Hachenburg
hit Thompson with a 34-yard
pass. On the very next play,
veteran slot-back Chris Leiser
dashed the remaining 34 yards

‘on a brilliant touchdown run.

Sophomore kicker Bill Devine
netted the point after, and the
Generals went ahead to stay,
14-13, midway through the
fourth quarter.

Fallon commented on Thomp-
son and Leiser: ‘Jerry got his
first opportunity for some play-
ing time and came up with some
clutch receptions. But his per-
formance doesn’t surprise any
of us. Leiser has made a great
comeback (from a leg injury)
this season, and has done well
under the pressure of replacing
Chris Cavalline (sophomore

tailback injured two weeks
ago).”

On the afternoon, Thompson
picked up 71 yards on only nine

carries, while Leiser added 54
yards on fifteen carries.

Through the air, Hachenburg
completed ten of eighteen for
122 yards. Thompson picked up
54 yards on four pass recep-
tions, while junior tight end
Mike Fogarty gained 40 yards
on two catches.

Kicking was an important
part of the General’s comeback
win. Freshman linebacker
Parker Schenecker did the pun-
ting for W&L (replacing the in-
jured Cavalline) and averaged

40 yards a kick, including one
fifty-yard boot. Schenecker
kept the Tiger offense deep in
its own territory early in the
game, placing one “‘coffin-
corner”’ kick out on the HSC one
yard line.

Reliable place kicker Devine,
while nailing down the goahead
extra point, added a crucial 28-
yard field goal with five
minutes left in the game. By
putting the Generals up by four,
Devine forced the Tigers to go
for a touchdown in their final
series. HSC managed to get as
close as the W&L nine yard line
with less then one minute left to
play before the Generals’
defense drove them back.

Leading the

 

Generals’

defense throughout the after-
noon was junior defensive end
Tommy Noble. Noble both in-
tercepted a pass and recovered
a fumble.

“Noble has really blossomed
as a defensive end this season,”
stated Fallon.

Next week the Generals take
on the University of the South in

W&L’s Homecoming game.

Fallon commented about
Sewanee: ‘‘When we played
them last year they were 6-0.
This year they are not as
strong, yet.it should be a wide-
open game. They have two
quarterbacks who like to throw,
so our defensive secondary had
better be ready.”

created the huge gap between
the two teams. Hopefully, it is

 

something that will not happen
more than once in the same

IFC Rush
Results

by Mike Perry

The Interfraternity Council
announced that 200 freshmen
have pledged Washington and
Lee’s seventeen fraternities.
These 200 men represent 61 per-
cent of the 1980-81 freshman
class.

Dean of Fraternities Affairs
Dan Murphy says this year’s
percentage is consistent with

“results since the mid 70’s of 60.

to 65 percent,” as well as last
year when 63 percent of the
freshmen class elected to
pledge a fraternity.

Murphy noted that the
relatively smaller size of this
year’s freshman class has
resulted in some fraternity
houses recruiting a small
freshman class, thus rendering
‘‘greater importance”’ to the list
of thirty individuals par-
ticipating in deferred fraternity
rush. “It will be important for a
few houses to put on an active
deferred rush program this
year,” Murphy said.

John Wells

Jimmy , Ronnie
and the Networks

As this, the longest presidential ordeal ever, fades into history
(and, perhaps, obscurity), it is interesting to assess media, par-
ticularly television, coverage of the spectacle — all most folks
know about the campaign is what they see through the network
camera lens.

We see Jimmy Carter, trying to convince us that an abysmal, in-
effective administration is better than one which is anxious to
launch our atomic salvos and end LifeOnThisPlanetAsWeKnowlt.

We see Ronald Reagan trying to tell us that, well, we just can’t af-
ford four more years of Jimmy Carter.

And John Anderson says we can doa lot better than that.

Since polls indicate that various percentages of U.S. voters are
trying to decide which of two or possibly three candidates is the
lesser of as many evils, it makes sense that the candidates are do-
ing their best to draw such distinctions among themselves, in their
rhetoric and campaign commercials.

Many network reporters seem to almost openly despise the presi-
dent, perhaps having experienced his deceptive, self-righteous
nature at close range. Starting with his Atlanta remarks about
Reagan’s hatred and racism, coverage of the Carter campaign
focused mainly on Jimmy’s long-standing habit of smearing his op-
ponents with outrageous, inflammatory falsehoods, which he would
piously deny later. Words like ‘‘mean’’ and ‘‘petty’’ were used to
describe his methods. Where were these terms when, during the
primaries, he refused to honor his promise to debate Ted Kennedy
and then called the senator ‘‘unpatriotic’’?

Now, since Carter’s extravagant rhetoric has become routine,
the so-called ‘‘war-peace’”’ topic — raised entirely by Carter to
divert attention from the defense posture he’s rendered impotent
—is treated as a genuine issue by the networks. Reagan has had to
answer to it in a paid political broadcast on CBS.

The Carter folks are upset, too, because they think the networks
have been giving Reagan a “free ride.’’ The number of times our
attention has been drawn to the GOP nominee gagging on his foot
attests to the validity of this indignation.

The White House has been careful of its image and is aware of
some areas of softness. For instance, the Big Gun in the family
quarters — the unofficial Democratic candidate, Rosalynn — has >
been kept in the wings all fall, except to giggle and grin at official
functions. The first lady, with her $600,000 staff budget and perceiv-
ed policy-making influence, has been one of many Carter con-
troversies, and she may be considered a liability.

Reagan aides, who probably have been paranoid about the press
for years, remain cautious.-Both candidates have been begged by
their advisers in recent appearances to stick entirely to the text of
their campaign speeches — otherwise the big story on the evening
news would be extemporaneous remarks such as Carter calling
Reagan a Marxist child-molester or Reagan saying fish cause
water pollution.

Someone wrote after the conventions that this campaign is more
fairly covered than any other because both candidates are hated
equally by the press. This says as much about the media as it does
about the candidates themselves.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

EC vs. FCC

The Executive Committee escaped certain embar-
rassment Monday evening by defeating a motion call-
ing for a survey to determine student opinion regar-
ding WLUR programming. While the EC’s attempt to
serve the student body’s preference may seem
valiant and even correct, our student government is
clearly out of bounds and overmatched.

As Journalism Professor Robert deMaria pointed
out, radio stations are licensed by the Federal Com-
munications Commission to serve the public interest.
The station has a responsibility to the Lexington Com-
munity as well as the student body. In other words,
the radio station is complying with federal
regulations—the EC would have to deal with the
federal government in this matter. Good luck fellas.

Housing Follies

The housing plans for next year stir up images of a
tenement building or a slave ship—generally over-
crowded. One can picture four freshmen stacked in a
closet, forced to shower at the gymnasium. Freshmen
in the Robert E. Lee Hotel will have a bar just down
the steps, which could be a bigger problem than over-
crowding. We serioulsly doubt, as Mr. Parson sug-
gests, that many freshmen are going to walk across
the street every time they want to take a shower.
What will we have then, a freshman class of dirtballs
who look like Pigpen in Charles Schultz’s comic strip
‘Peanuts’?

We are glad to see the University is going to
renovate the Grahm-Lees Dormitories before they
burn to the ground, destroying half the freshman
class. But we wonder if the class will not be forced in-
to a bad situation which could hurt the University and
the class as a whole. Be serious, should a 14 x 9 room
hold two freshmen? Should freshmen be living in a
building with a bar. We urge the administration at
Washington and Lee to take another look at the hous-
ing situation.

Student Criticizes Sawyer

Dear Sir:

As the author of the article
urging students to vote that was
much maligned in last week’s
Ring-tum Phi, I feel obligated to
respond to the rantings of Mr.
C. K. Sawyer. Mr. Sawyer’s
contentions are an insult to the
sensibilities of all American
citizens, and I will not waste
space refuting his narrow,
selfish, shortsighted, and _ir-
responsible attacks on the role
of the American government.

What must be addressed,
however, is Mr. Sawyer’s
dangerous claim that voting
shows compliance with the pre-
sent policies of the federal
government. It does no such
thing. It demonstrates a com-
mitment to the democratic pro-
cess of government. If Mr.
Sawyer is opposed to particular
policies he is free, as are all
voters, to cast a ballot for any of

‘a number of parties that pro-

pose changes in public policy.
As Mr. Sawyer is well aware the
Libertarian Party represents

Spectator:

 

the alternate point of view he
expressed in his letter — he has

been active in distributing in-

formation on libertarianism on,
campus. The party’s candidate
is on the ballot in every state.
Other candidates are running
and promoting communism,
socialism, and yes, even
moderation. The effective
method to indicate a preference
for a change in policy is to vote

for the candidate of one of these
alternate parties.

Mr. Sawyer has urged
students not to vote in order to
express opposition to present
policies. But the vote does not
legitimize these policies — it
legitimizes the democratic pro-
cess. An attack on voting is in-
herently an attack on the
democratic process. An attack
on voting is inherently an attack
on the democratic system of
government. If that is Mr.
Sawyer’s radical change in the
system, I leave him to his grim
task of non-political revolution
and challenge him to quit play-
ing with radicalism. As for
myself, I much prefer to exer-
cise one of the many rights and
freedoms guaranteed by the
federal government to me, Mr.
Sawyer, and all Americans over
eighteen years of age — I will
take time for America and ex-
press my concern by voting in
the November general election.

Great misfortunes...hideous omens. Bad times
have fallen on Lexington and worse ones still to
come. In days gone by, glorious days, Lexington
was blessed with haute cuisine. Lexington, hungry
Lexington, where have all your Swiss Burgers
gone? Central Lunch is no more; Mr. Duck is
gone. And, woe, alas, in place of bacon, cheese,
tomato soybean delight...is, of all misfortunes, a
peanut factory. The infidels from Georgia are in-
vading Little Roma. Jimmy Carter’s campaign
headquarters is now located in Lexington’s most
cherished establishment.

Once you could go to Duck’s for a cold six of
America’s finest. Central Lunch was a symbol of
capitalistic ingenuity: the coldest beer, the
greasiest fries, the cheapest fare. Now Carter
brews insipid moonshine and economic disaster.
But let’s hope that Mr. Duck’s ingenuity and his

success don’t rub off on Carter. Yet, you can hear
that new Carter campaign slogan already ‘Yah
all come back and see us now, yah hear.”’ If Carter
is indeed elected it is because he has usurped, he
has stolen this nation’s most sacred image: the
greasy spoon.

Let’s face the facts, my hedonistic friends. If
Jimmy is elected, you’ll be languishing in the
same old homegrown blues. But if Bonzo’s friend
wins, you'll have a chance to tour the world. Im-
agine a real Afghanistan high! Think of the exotic
colors in a Persian rug; those carpet-weavers
really know what psychedelic. means. Amber
waves of poppy seed...Lebanese and Taiwanese!
So if you’re looking for the best buzz of your life,
then go with Ronnie. Take a trip on the seven seas,
and remember, the marinas are always looking
for a few good fish.
Soccer Star
Makes Apology

Dear Editor,

In reference to my interview
in the October 16 issue of the
Ring-tum Phi, I would like to
make public my apology to
Coach Rolf Piranian. It was due
to my poor judgement that a
grave misunderstanding took
place. I would like to make it
clear that I have the utmost
confidence in Coach Piranian’s
knowledge of all aspects of the
game of soccer.

It is his knowledge and ability
as a coach which is responsible
for our team’s success (6-2 as of
Monday). There have been
games this season that would
have been futile efforts without
Coach Piranian’s knowledge
and foresight. Furthermore, I
believe it must be apparent that
a team which has outscored
its opponents 18-9 has a coach
with exceptional knowledge in
the offensive, as well as the
defensive aspects of the game.

NUMBER7

Eleven Proposals Approved

In Three-hour Session

by Cope Moyers

Several sweeping proposals
to amend the student body con-
‘Stitution were approved by the
Executive Committee Monday
night and will be voted on by the
student body next week.

Among the eleven proposals
approved by the committee is
an amendment that would
change the number of votes
needed by a candidate in order
to be elected to office. Under the
proposed amendment, which is
aimed at eliminating some run-
off elections, any candidate
running for one position would
need a simple majority of votes
in order to be elected.

The constitution now requires
that the two candidates receiv-
ing the most votes be in a run-
off the Thursday after the elec-
tion. The candidate then receiv-
ing the most votes is the winner.

“This amendment is a com-
promise between what we have
now and abolishing run-offs
completely,’’ said EC member
Jeff Edwards.

Edwards, who co-authored
the ten proposed amendments
with EC member Marshall
Clark, said the present system
does not work effectively
because it permits a candidate
who did not receive a plurality
in the first election to still win

the position by winning the run-
off.

“It’s not fair to tell someone
they don’t win when they get the
most votes,’’ Edwards said.

The proposal also allows for
run-offs when two positions are
at stake. The candidate with the
most votes automatically wins
one of the two positions while

the next two candidates with the:
most votes are in the Thursday
run-off.

A similar rule would apply
when three positions are con-
tested. The two candidates with
the most votes would be
declared winners and the next
two candidates with the most
votes would face each other in
the run-off election. The winner
would gain the third position.

The committee also approved
a proposed amendment
designating the sixth Monday of
the fall term as election day for
first-year law students. The
proposal would permit the law
school to elect its second
member to the Executive Com-
mittee earlier than in past
years, giving them better
representation on the commit-
tee. The freshman position on
the EC would be filled the sixth
week after undergraduate
classes begin.

Another proposed amend-

W&L Employee Arrested

By John R. Smith

A Washington and Lee
employee was arrested by Lex-
ington police Monday on
charges including six counts of
breaking and entering and one
count of grand larceny.

Charles Russell Smith of Rt.
1, Lexington, has been charged
with breaking and entering the
W&L maintenance shop on five
different occasions, August 8,
12, and 15, and September 15
and 16. He is also charged with

breaking into a house at 112 W.
Nelson St. on August 13.
The grand larceny charge in-

volves the theft of a Pioneer

stereo system belonging to
George N. Weatherly, a W&L
freshman living in Graham-
Lees Dormitory. The stereo,
which was recovered, was
valued at more than $200.

Smith was also charged with
the theft of some 53 record
albums from Russell ‘“‘Beaker’’
Stall in the August 13

SAB Favors Price

by Frank Billingsley

Fancy Dress tickets will cost
$20, or possibly $25, this year if
a current proposal passes the
Student Activities Board Sun-
day night.

A five-dollar increase would
give the board $30,000 for the
dance while a ten-dollar in-
crease would allow $37,500.
Fancy Dress is paid for totally
by the sale of tickets, which
have cost $15 since 1974.

Co-Chairman Pryse Elam
who introduced the idea at Sun-
day night’s meeting, explained
that the additional funds are
needed to pay for entertain-
ment. ‘‘We’re spending a lot
more money this year for enter-
tainment and can’t afford to
lose any money out of our
budget,” Elam said.

The SAB says it cannot give
any specific justification for the
extra money without revealing

break-in of the Munster House
on W. Nelson St.

Police have also charged the
W&L employee with three
counts of petty larceny, all
stemming from the August
break-ins at the maintenance
shop. He is charged with the
theft of a fire extinguisher, an
automobile battery, and wall
paper, all belonging to the
University.

Proposals

May Never
Pass

Monday night’s Executive
Committee meeting resulted in
eleven proposals that may
never become amendments to
the student body constitution.

Calling the student body con-
Stitution ‘‘six years out of
date,’’ EC president Bob Wilis
stressed the importance of
amending it to include the
eleven proposals approved at
the meeting.

We’ve got to go out of our way
to get these passed,’’ Willis
said.

But the student body constitu-
tion specifically states that any
amendments to the constitution
can only be passed when fifty
percent of the entire student
body votes on the proposals and
they pass by a two-thirds ma-
jority. ’

The committee expressed
concern that none of the amend-
ments would pass because of
student apathy.

“T am really afraid that all
the work we did tonight will go
to waste because not enough
students will vote next week,”’
EC member Jim Vines said.

Vines proposed a motion that
would permit the Executive
Committee to amend the con-
stitution simply by a two-thirds
vote of the committee. Students
would not vote on the matter. :

Willis urged all members of
the committee to campaign ac-
tively for student participation
in the proposed amendment
vote next week. The EC will
post notices around the Univer-
sity as well as contact the
fraternities reminding students
to vote.

We’ve got to get these pass-
ed,”’ said Willis.

Voting will take place during
student registration for winter
term. Polls will be set up in the
freshman quad, the law school
and in the registrar’s.office and
will be opened during. class
hours.

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Monty Briscoe reported
results of a discussion he had
with Lexington town Manager
John Phillips and Dean of
Students Lewis John. Briscoe
Stated that Dean John is
prepared to sign amplified
noise permits, thus enabling
houses previously issued noise
ordinance violations. Frater-
nities placed on Social Proba-
tion will not be issued noise per-
mits.

Briscoe believes the noise
problem will lessen during the
Winter months when
“everybody closes their win-
dows,” but warned fraternities
that police will begin pro-
secuting the individuals obtain-
ing noise permits. ‘I can’t say
exactly how the Judicial Board
will interpret this; but I think
we will view individuals as

responsible.”’

On the subject of law enforce-
ment, Briscoe related Mayor-
Phillips concern that the Lex-

and University Proctor Charles
Murray urged student crime
victims to cooperate with police
efforts to prosecute suspects.

Briscoe added that Officer
Colbert can be particularly
helpful in this regard. Rob
Brooke said the police were
very effective in solving a
crime at the Phi Kappa Sigma
house. “It’s not always an im-
pressive judicial process, but it
works,” he said.

The police believe “there is a
small group of individuals com-
mitting these crimes” and can
usually be easily apprehended,
said Briscoe.

Fraternity representatives
from four houses complained
about services rendered under
the new fraternity maintenance
program. A Sigma Phi Epsilon
representative said that the
heat in their fraternity house
shut off the day after it was fix-
ed. Briscoe added that he knew
of an instance in which the Phi
Kappa Alpha house was “billed
twice for 25 light bulbs.”

Lechers And Harlots: Asian Studies

Dr. Donald Gillin, head of
Vassar College’s east Asian
studies program, will speak
today at Washington and Lee
University on the intriguing
topic ‘‘Lechers and Harlots:
American, Chinese . and
Japanese Images of One
Another’s Sexuality from 1900
to The Present.’’

Gillin’s visit to W&L and his 8
p.m. slide-lecture in duPont
Auditorium are sponsored by
Washington and Lee’s Asian
studies program.

Gillin received his Ph.D. from
Stanford in 1959 and has taught

More Excerpts

 

at several universities and has
been awarded a number of
research fellowships in the
United States and in the Orient.
He is the author of ‘Yen Hsi-

shan in Shansi Province,
1911-45,” a portrait of one of the
most important Chinese

warlords. He has also published
an east Asian bibliography for
undergraduate libraries, a
series of scholarly articles, and
book reviews in leading jour-
nals of history and Asian af-

_ fairs.

He is now at work on a multi-
volume study of the Chinese

civil way of 1945-49, a chapter of
which will appear in the for-
thcoming ‘‘Cambridge History
of China.”’

This will be Gillin’s second
visit to Washington and Lee.
During his first, two years ago,
he delivered another talk il-
lustrated with slides on the
topic of misconceptions of each
other in Chinese and American
media in the 20th century. That
presentation has since been
issued commercially by the
China Council of the Asia Socie-

President Comments On Fraternities

Editor’s Note: The following
comments were taken from
President Huntley’s speech to
parents on Parents’ Weekend.
The excerpts were selected and
printed by the news office.

... There are now, and always
will be, rough corners that need
repairing or smoothing, and
new things that need to be done.

There are, for example, ques-
tions about the future role of
fraternities. We have taken
some initiatives that we hope, in
cooperation with the students,
will assist and strengthen the
fraternity system here. We
think there are advantages to
fraternities, and there are also
some disadvantages. We hope
to find ways of maximizing the
former and minimizing the lat-
ter.

One side comment about that.
Some of the difficulties frater-
nities have, and have had for
the last several years (and pro-
bably will have for a while) are
not entirely the fault of the
students who are here now.
Some of the difficulties they en-
counter in their physical plants
and — in some cases — in the
ways in which they carry out
their operations reflect pro-
blems they found when they ar-
rived here. Most of whatever
deterioration there has been
has probably occurred in the

Engineering, International Affairs, Journalism; Law, Public Héalth,

Social Work, and Teacher’s' oe

last 15 or 20 years, a relatively
slow process, and it will take a
while to repair the damage that
those 15 or 20 years may have
brought — not just the physical
damage to the houses but the
damage to the concept of the
system.

I think, though I do not know
for certain, that the road up toa
new role for fraternities that
will be constructive has been
begun. I think the students on
campus — largely — wish to
continue to have the kind of
responsibility they have had in
the past for fraternity life and to

discharge that responsibility
more ably than perhaps
students in the last decade have
been able to do.

Our role — the University’s
role — is to provide every op-
portunity we can in the area of
fraternity life, as we do in every
other area of Washington and
Lee life, for students to develop
a sense of responsibility for
their own affairs. That is a part
of the educational philosophy of
this University, as I think you
well know.

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has begun a year-long, $1.1-

miltion renovation and
remodeling of one and a half
floors of its former law

building, Tucker Hall, to ac-
commodate the university’s
psychology department and
computer center.

The project is being under-
taken essentially in two phases.

In the first, the old law library .

reading room which occupied
the back half of Tucker Hall’s
main floor is being readied to
house the computer and a se-
cond level is being added in the
middle of the room to provide
offices and classrooms for the
psychology department.

Simultaneously, the front
part of Tucker’s basement is be-
ing remodeled to become a
cluster of laboratory and work
areas for experiments in
psychology.

Once the new computer
facilities are completed, about
Christmastime this year, the
computer itself, now operating
in temporary quarters in the
back part of the Tucker base-
ment, will be moved upstairs to
its new permanent location, and
work will commence to convert
that part of the basement into
other labs, offices, and teaching
and research facilities in
psychology.

That second part. of the
Tucker project is expected to be
completed next summer.

The new ‘“‘mezzanine”’ level in
the former law library is being
constructed as a kind of island

 

in the middle of the two-story -

room, in order to preserve the
architectural character that
distinguishes it.

The new story will provide
two psychology classrooms and
four faculty offices.

The computer center on the
main level will provide ample
work areas for students,
teachers, and the computer
staff in addition to the computer
itself.
academic records.

When the basement is com-
pleted, it will become the
teaching and research center
for W&L’s psychologists.

In addition to another faculty
office, the basement will have
several small laboratories that
will be used by teachers and
psychology students for re-
search, and most of the labs will

experiments in a wide range of
subfields of psychology.

There will be two laboratories
equipped for research in de-
velopmental psychlogy, for in-
stance, another for electro-
physiological experimentation
such as measurement of brain
waves, a lab for research into
perceptual phenomena, one for
psyometric testing and another
for psyometric testing.

Each of those subfields is one
in which W&L offers course-
work, and at least one W&L pro-
fessor is also actively engaged
in research in each.

The two psychology class-
rooms, which have been
specially designed, will be
equipped with videotape play-

The Tucker renovation will

current area in DuPont Hall.

There will be several small
rooms devoted to animal ex-

the Tucker basement being
renovated in the first phase of
the project. Jarrard has long
been a leading researcher into
the role of the hippocampus, a
portion of the brain, in
psychological and physical
disorders, and his chief
research subjects have been
white rats.

Two new entrances to the
building are being added, one
into the basement on the north
side to the rear, and another in
the middle of the south side,
toward the center of W&L’s Col-
onnade.

Washington and Lee’s fine
arts department will move into
the space in DuPont freed next
summer when the psychologists
complete their move to Tucker.

The Tucker renovation, an
element in W&L’s decade-long
62-million development plan, is
part of a general program to
provide badly needed additional
classroom, office and research
space for many of the under-
gradute departments in the
social sciences and humanities.

and Messrs. SWALLOW, SHEPHERD, THOMP-
SON, ADAMS, WELCH, and SHUMAN as the
Soldiers of the 13ist Regiment of Foot (‘Queen’s
Own’), Richard Mogavero, directing.

DISCIPLE is a chattering magpie of a play, and
as the dialogue goeth, so goes the production.
Well, the dialogue went very well indeed. The
opening night slips we expected — and there were
only three — were few and far between. As a
result, our pulse-rate and our side-splitting guf-
faws -- quickened in exact time with the script.

Staging was bare, essential, and flawless. The
comfortable colonial clutter of a New England
home was suggested beautifully by an arrange-
ment which made the stage look lived upon while
allowing the actors leg room — no small feat in
W&L’s shoebox of a theatre. (One doubts the
University mentioned our sardine syndrome when
angling for Mr. Mogavero. )

Sets, obviously, had to bow to the exigencies of

our cozy, domestic arrangements...but you could
never tell. The bare, essential rendering con-
tributed to the deliberate unreality of the stage:
that peculiar magic of the theatre. Kudos to Elenn
Jervey for a truly professional job.

An aside: Sound and Lighting deserve a victory
dinner of some sort or another. The technical
aspects of production were up to scratch by any
standards. Mogavero’s personal choice of inciden-
tal music, chosen from the musical literature of
the period and taking its cue from certain indica-
tions by Bernard Shaw himseif, went far towards
effecting a triumph such as, indeed, resulted on
opening night. If we may advise The Powers That
Be (or, this being the theatre, Not To Be), we sug-
gest that they get the portion of the upper floor
that is directly above the seats soundproofed.
While footsteps of Celestial Doom over our head
are effective during Dudgeon’s trial, ‘Hey, Louie!’
during the reading of Old Dugeon’s will is
somewhat enervating. On the whole, however, we
can find no aspect of production lacking.

Ah, and now to business: individual perfor-
mances and an assessment of the play as a whole.
Opening night was a critic’s bane. Having spent
years mastering the fine art of verbal assault, we
can find no faults on which to train our tongue. All
our best insults are left hanging.

Mogavero’s abilities to work with and around
the Troubador’s limitations leave me breathless.
Rick Kukucka in the title role bestrides the stage
like a colossus; his transition from drawling rebel
to sacrificial victim is an epiphany of the first
water. (Good news, sports fans: the guy’s going to
be around for some time, too...) Carla Dillon turns
in a definitive performance as the ultimate virago
whose failure as a mother turned her son from the
straight and narrow. A delightful lady offstage,
Ms. Dillon, behind the spots, is the least-likely-to-
be tamed shrew we have seen since ‘‘Kiss Me,
Kate”’ was last on the Late Show.

New From Bruce

Commercial ‘River’ Flows
by Robin Meredith

For a man who reportedly
doesn’t care much about money
or (at least until recently)
publicity, Bruce Springsteen is
really one hell of a PR man. His
last three records have been
legendary even before their-
release; his album (Darkness
On the Edge of Town and tour
of the summer of ’78 successful-
ly overshadowed the Stone’s

 

Recordings

 

tour (their most extensive ever
in the states) and album (their
best-selling to date) of the same
summer, and it could
reasonably be said that no artist
has ever been catapulted into
the national spotlight faster
than Bruce was by the events
. Surrounding Born to Run’s
release in 1975. Now, we have
The River. A two-record set,
released after months of edge-
of-the-seat anticipation (but
surprisingly little media fan-
fare), Springsteen’s fifth album
is his most commercially
palatable to date. It includes
what could well be his first ma-
jor single hit (“Hungry Heart’’)
and should win him legions of
new admirers. without
alienating any of the diehards
(something that could not be
said about Darkness). The
River is a great rock’n’roll
album, but when you’re dealing
with an artist of Springsteen’s
stature, one larger question
must be addressed; is The
River a _ great Springsteen
album??

The first thing you’re likely to
notice about this record (say,
by the time you get halfway
through side two) is how damn-
ed happy Bruce sounds. The
River puts Springsteen’s career

into perspective in impressive
fashion; four lines from ‘“Two
Hearts” — Once I spent my
time playing tough guy scenes
/but I was living in a world of
childish dreams / someday
these childish dreams must end
/ to become a man and grow up
to dream again’’ — summarize
the progression from Born To
Run to Darkness to The River.
Bruce has exorcised the
demons that made Darkness
such a downer; songs like
“Sherry Darling’ (his ‘Frat
Rock” song) and “I wanna
Marry You’’ harken back to
pre-1965 romanticism, and with
such hard-nosed rockers as
“Crush On You,” “You Can
Look (But You Better Not

Touch),” ‘I’m a_ Rocker,”
“Cadillac Ranch,’’ and
“Ramrod,” he has finally

begun to write his own versions
of the oldies he loves so much,
angry, rebellious, funny, guitar-
driven songs that rock harder
than anything he’s done before.

These are the songs that will
be especially attractive to those
whose first contact with Spr-
ingsteen comes through The
River. The funny typed into two
distinct groups. On one hand,
the songs mentioned above,
along with ‘‘Out In The Street”
and ‘‘Hungry Heart,” define a

Sea Level Cooks

by Ross Newell

Chuck Leavell shot basketball in Doremus Gym
Friday afternoon, retracing footsteps left by
Duane Allman nine years earlier when the Allman
Brothers played at W&L. Deja vous anticipation.

Sea Level was the best buzz available in Lex-
ington this weekend. They were the real rush, the
franchise of homecoming.

The rainy reality outside the gym contrasted
with the climactic bliss. Indeed, many thought
they were living in a dream as they watched the
piano pounding perfectionist and his band do it up
in a classic performance Friday night.

Leavell had been wearing gloves all afternoon to
keep his hands warm, and there seemed to be fire
in his finger tips as the band opened with “‘Fifty-~
Four.”

The crowd had fire in their eyes. The reception
they gave Sea Level would have made Jack Em-
mer jealous. Leavell appreciated it. ‘“‘One of the
most receptive crowds we’ve ever played to,”’ he
said after the show.

The second and third songs, ‘‘Anxiously
Awaiting’ and “Living in a Dream,”’ further
established the atmosphere of the concert. The at-
mosphere was charged with energy, but it was
controlled rather than rowdy. Just right for the
delivery of Sea Level’s jazz-rock music.

From the beginning, it was clear that the band
enjoyed the concert as much as the fans did. The
band’s new bass player, Paul Brodeur, played
some riffs that would have turned Stanley Clark’s
head. At times it was unclear which was moving
faster, Brodeur’s feet or his fingers. Rarely stan-
ding still, Brodeur contributed much to Sea
Level’s stage presence.

The band played all of the new album
‘“‘Ballroom’’ and the songs sounded better live
than they do on the album. Many critics consider
the album a switch in musical direction away
from jazz and towards rock.

However the transition was smooth Friday night
as: the band alternated between old and new
material with little trouble. Classic Sea Level
songs much as “‘Grand Larceny,”’ ‘‘That’s Your
Secret,” and ‘‘Rain in Spain,’ on which the band
built its early reputation as powerful instrumen-
talists, were well received by the audience.

And, when it came time to ‘‘Share a Leg,” a
song from the band’s first album, few of those on
the floor needed further coaxing. It was obvious
that the rope stretched in front of the stage would
fall before the crowd with as little difficulty as
Atlanta fell before Sherman, and with about the
same amount of smoke.

By the second encore the stage hands up front
had stopped saying ‘‘move back, get behind the
rope’’ and started yelling ‘“Go Chuck.’’ No sense in
being stubborn, it’s not everyday that a band like
Sea Level stops by Lexington for anything other
than a clean restroom or a cup of coffee.

Perhaps the highlight of the encores was
“School Teacher” from ‘Ballroom.’ Guitarist
Davis Causey and Jimmy Nalls switched off some
mean leads; Randall Bramblett belted out the
vocals; percusionists Matt Greeley and Steve
Kent established an energetic beat, and Leavell,
the all-bad, played the piano like only he can.

Poor acoustics in Doremus gym detracted from
the band’s music, which, unlike
much of the music on the market today, has a firm
basis in quality.

The emphasis on quality has persisted since the
band’s beginning in 1977. Early that year Leavell,
Jaimoe Johnson and Lamar Williams, of the
Allman Brothers Band, and George Weaver and
Jimmy Nalls recorded ‘‘Sea Level.”’

Later in 1977, Bramblett, on saxophone and
‘keyboards, and Causey, on guitar, joined the
band and contributed further variety to its music.

“Cats on the Coast” was released in 1978 and a
single from the album, ‘“‘That’s Your Secret”
made the charts and increased the band’s follow-
ing. Also in 1978, Sea Level went on a European
tour that included a performance at the Montreux
Jazz Festival in Switzerland. During this time,
Leavell’s ability on the piano and keyboards and
Bramblett’s ability on the saxophone and organ
won critical acclaim in the music world.

Following the tour Weaver left Sea Level and
was replaced by Joe English, who had been a
drummer for Wings. After this personnel change,
the band released ‘‘On the Edge.”

Between ‘‘On the Edge’’ and the most recent
release “Ballroom”’ Sea Level cut another album
never released in the United States because of con-
tractual problems with the now defunct Capricorn
Records. This album, ‘‘Long Walk on a Short
Pier’ was the beginning of a new direction
towards vocal oriented rock that characterizes
“‘Ballroom.”’

The road manager said the new musical direc-
tion was a logical outgrowth of the progressive
and innovative nature of the band.

Leavell said that the new direction and new per-
sonnel have given the band a stronger feeling of
unity and energy that existed in the past.

If the concert Friday night was any indication,
Leavell is as accurate in his analysis as he is in
playing the piano.

close to being throwaways. On
the other hand, The River’s
ballads (‘‘Independence Day,”’
“Point Blank,” ‘Stolen Car,”

“Wreck On The Highway”’ is

Commentary:

A Stunning Victory

by Ralph Frasca

Coming off last week’s stun-
ning, inspiring victory, the
Generals looked like a sure bet
to enter last Saturday’s game
against Sewanee with their
heads in the clouds. It occurred
to more than one fan that the
Generals might be due for a
fall, according to the old axiom,
“What goes up must come
down.”’ But they simply refused
to be denied, and captured their
final home game of the season,
20-14.

The major concern of all in-
volved was the field condition.
It had rained the night before
the game, and a continuous
drizzle dampened the skin but
not the spirits of hardy fans
throughout the game. The field
degenerated to a quagmire, and
the contest could only be
described as ‘‘The Battle of Big
Muddy.”

After the Generals missed
two field goals, Sewanee should
have remotely considered the
possibility of a fake field goal on
fourth down and short yardage.
But they were caught complete-
ly by surprise when Chris
Leiser hauled in a pass from
field goal holder Rich
Hachenberg and carried it to
the one-yard line. It seemed on-
ly fitting that Leiser should
punch through the Tigers’
defense for the first score.

Tailback Kenny Robinson
was responsible for the second
tally. An overnight hero as a
result of his 71-yard perfor-
mance against Hampden-
Sydney two weekends ago,
Robinson moved the ball at will
against Sewanee’s porous
defense, finally driving to the
one, where the Generals
threatened on second down. A
substitute was then sent in,
much to the outrage of fans,
who shouted, ‘‘Put Kenny in!”
On third-and-two he returned,
no doubt bearing a play from
Coach Fallon. If you were in the

Varsity

by Phil Murray

The varsity lacrosse team
evened the series record at 3-3
with the Alumni this weekend in
the sixth annual Alumni
Lacrosse Game by defeating
the former W&L stars 18-10.

The Alumni team boasted a
number of former All-
Americans including three All-
American goalies: Skeet Chad-
wick ’74, Charlie Brown ’78 and
Bob Clements, and three U.S.
World Team members: Chad-
wick, Tom Keigler ’77, and Skip
Lichtfull ’74.

The Alumni team started fast

stands then, you knew the bail
was going to Robinson. He
scored on a right side sweep,
thanks to some crucial blocking
from the offensive line.

The third tally was registered
by Mike Fogarty, who was open
in the defensive backfield all
day long. One fan mused, “‘he’s
alwasy open because he’s too
big to cover.’’ That must cer-
tainly be the case, for the hulk-
ing tight end is certainly too
large to overlook. ‘Always
Open’ Fogarty’s touchdown
raised the score to 20-7, and fans
began streaming from the
stands. However, Sewanee’s
comatose offense suddenly
came to life and drove in for the
score, narrowing the gap to six
points.

It’s nice to have friends in
high places, though, and the
clock on the scoreboard was a
true comrade of the Generals.
Only a few minutes remained,
and the White-and-Blue crew
had simply to accumulate a few
first downs, and the game was
theirs. But first downs were in
short supply then, and the
Generals were forced to punt.

One touchdown could snatch
victory from the jaws of defeat
for the Tigers, and the two miss-
ed field goals and two unsuc:
cessful extra point attempts
loomed ever larger. However,
the Sack Pack defense
obliterated any designs on vic-
tory their opponents may have
possessed. Helping quarterback
Robert Holland examine the
field conditions at closer range
than he wished to, the Generals’
defense held tough, their efforts
culminating in a game-ending
interception by Gene Fellin.

The spectacular victory was
secure, the upset achieved.
There were no individual stars,
simply a consistent offense and
a voracious defense. Teamwork
earmarked this game, folks,
and the Falcon’s boys should be
proud.

But then the Varsity took com-

mand, scoring four unanswered
goals to lead 4-1 at the end of the
first period.

The varsity held onto their
lead through the second period
and led at the half 7-3.

But the Alumni came out
strong in the second half with
two quick goals and looked like
they might overtake the Varsi-
ty. They stayed within two goals
for most of the third period but
could get nv closer.

Booters Blank Keydets, 3-0

by Mark Schramm

It proved to be a tough week
for the Generals, as they drop-
ped a key match to ODAC rival
Roanoke 3-1 before rebounding
to beat VMI by the game score.
Although their record now
stands at 7-3, the loss dimmed
their hopes of reaching the
ODAC playoffs.

Despite convincing victories
in their last three games, the
Generals started poorly against
Roanoke and never seemed to
get untracked. Roanoke scored
early in the first half, and ap-
plied steady pressure.

The W&L defense was up to
the task, however. Fullbacks
Steve Smith and Mark Sullivan,
who shared Player of the Game
awards, aggressively attacked
the ball and cleared the zone,
and Goalie Kevin Carney made

 

several key saves.

The second half proved
frustrating. Roanoke scored
their second goal, but the tide
seemed to be swinging to the
other side, as W&L made their
presence felt around the
Roanoke net.

Their perseverence paid off,
as Brad Poorman was fouled in
the penalty area. The Generals’

The younger players finally
pulled away as the Varsity
speed proved too much for the
Alumni and won easily 18-10.

Coach Jack Emmer was im-
mensely pleased with the play
of his team and came away “op-

timistic” about the upcoming
season,

Pere Roberts had an outstan-
ding game with four goals and
two assists. Also, Mike Lewers
and John Kemp contributed two
goals and two assists apiece.

penalty specialist, Bryan
Williams, was injured however,

and Poorman’s kick was wide of

the post.

Roanoke added another goal,
but the Generals refused to give
up, and Roland Simon tallied
his sixth goal. A ball was chip-
ped downfield, and Simon
outraced his defender to it. “I
had my back to the goal,” the
high-scoring freshman said,
“‘and I just twisted around and
got off a shot.” His 20 yarder

caught the goalie off guard, and .

the ball skimmed just inside the
far post.

The Generals had an addi-
tional opportunity when they
received another penalty kick,
but Ben Muskin’s blast was
stopped short by a quick lunge

_ from the Roanoke goaltender.

v

When asked if the earlier con-
troversy with Roland Simon
had a negative effect on the
team’s play, Coach Rolf Pira-
nian said, “That was no pro-
blem at all. Roland called me
the day the article came out and
explained everything. I think
that shows what kind of guy he
is.”

Simon, making the usual ex-
cuse, said, ‘‘My comments were
taken out of context.” “‘There’s
not a guy on this team that
doesn’t have the utmost respect
for Coach. I know he’s really
helped me improve my play.”

Their fortunes improved
against VMI, as the Generals
walked off with a 3-1 victory.

Despite playing without four
key players and having several
others out of position, W&L
scored early and the issue was
never in question.

Roland Simon scored at the
4:00 mark, as Brad Poorman
beat his defender down the wing
and dropped a pass right on
Simon’s foot just six yards from
the goal. Simon simply tapped
the ball into the open net.

“TI figure that if I don’t score
goals, I’m not doing my job,” he
said. “With guys like Brad
Poorman, Tom Elder, and
Jerry Moyer feeding me, I know
I’m gonna get the chance.”

Simon performed his sole
function as he scored in the se-
cond half. He intercepted a
wayward VMI pass and smack-
ed a shot on the volley just
under the crossbar. It was his
eighth goal of the season,

The Generals added a third
goal near the end of the match.
Tad Renner passed upfield to
Ben Muskin. The steady mid-
fielder headed the ball to Mark
Sullivan, who crossed to Simon.
Simon passed to Mark Turner,
and the senior forward’s shot
was right on target.

Steve Smith and Paul Ritter
shared Player of the Game
awards with Roland Simon.
“Steve is a big asset to our
defense,’’ Coach Piranian said,
‘“He’s not easily intimidated.”
Ritter was playing in his final
match for the Generals, as he
had to withdraw from school.
The intense midfield play of the
Pennsylvania sophomore will
be sorely felt.

Despite having only one
ODAC loss, the Generals

playoff hopes depend on the per-
formance of undefeated Lynch-
burg. Should they play im-
preeively in their final three
games, they should qualify for a
bid to the NCAA playoffs.

Generals Humble Sewanee In Rain, 20-14

by Dale Park

On a muddy Wilson Field last
Saturday, the Washington ‘and
Lee varsity football team made
it two in a row with an exciting
20-14 win over the Sewanee
Tigers.

The victory lifted W&L’s
overall record to 5-2.

“‘We have a knack for making
these games thrillers,’ said
head coach Gary Fallon. ‘‘But
it’s a lot more enjoyable to be
winning the close ones rather
than losing them.”’

In the first 16 minutes of play,
the Generals mounted two
substantial drives only to be
stopped inside the 25 yard line
both times. Although the
Generals had dominated play,
two Bill Devine field goal at-
tempts missed their mark and
W&L came away empty.

On the very next possession
following Devine’s second er-
ront try, the Generals drove to
the Tiger 11 yard line where the
drive stalled. Devine was then
sent out for an apparent field

goal try.

Instead, junior quarterback
Rich Hachenburg took the snap,
stood up, and fired a pass to
senior slotback Chris Leiser.
Leiser made it all the way to the

7 Mike Foggerty snares pass in action against Sewanee Saturday.

one yard line and, on the very
next play, dove in for the score.

‘Devine was a little off,”
stated Fallon, ‘‘and we had
been practicing a fake field goal
play since day one. Hachenburg
and Leiser did an excellent job
of executing it.” The extra point
was failed, and W&L led 6-0.

 

On the next possession
Hachenburg moved the
Generals 60 yards in nine plays
for a touchdown capped by
sophomore tailback Ken Robin-
son’s two yard scoring run (the
point after was again unsuc-
cessful.

“Robinson is a_ hungry

 

player,”’ commented Fallon,
‘and it shows in his play. He
gives our offense a new dimen-
sion and gives Leiser a
breather.”’

On the afternoon, Robinson
gained 83 yards on 17 carries,
while Leiser, the game’s
leading rusher, picked up 114
yards on 26 attempts. Said
Fallon, ‘“‘Leiser has those quick,
short steps which are important

‘in muddy conditions.”

In all, W&L_ outrushed
Sewanee 255 yards to 51.

Sewanee struck back on a six
yard touchdown pass in the
third quarter to cut the W&L
lead to 12-7. The Generals
responded early in the fourth

quarter as Hachenburg (who
completed 11 of 17 for 103 yards)
found junior tight end Mike
Fogarty in the end zone. A two
point conversion extended
W&L’s lead to 20-7.

“Fogarty came up with some
big catches for us,’ stated
Fallon. ‘“He’s a big target and
now other teams will have to
look at him more closely.”

Fogarty caught five passes
for 56 yards and one touchdown.

Sewanee was not finished,
however. With only three

minutes left to play the Tigers
scored on a one yard touchdown
dive. The successful point after
moved Sewanee to within six
points, 20-14.

But for the remainder of the
game the W&L_ defense,
especially the pass rush, stiffen-
ed. Sewanee’s final drive was
stopped short as sophomore
defensive back Gene Fellin in-
tercepted a Tiger pass and end-

- ed the game.
Commented Fallon: ‘With
Nickels (junior defensive

tackle) not at full strength and
with Davis (senior defensive
tackle) injured, our pass rush
relied on young players. Even
with the equipment getting
muddy and heavy, the line kept
the pressure on the Sewanee
quarterback all afternoon and
did an excellent job.”

The defensive effort last
Saturday was good practice for
next Saturday’s away game
against Bridgewater.

Bridgewater quarterback
Duane Harrison was last year’s
ODAC passing and punting
champ and ‘“‘kept us off balance
all game long last time,”’ said
Fallon.

Water Polo Team Triumphs In Tourney

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team at-
tained one of their most impor-
tant goals for the season last
weekend as they defeated the
University of Richmond 9-4 in
the decisive game of the
Southern Water Polo League
Tournament. In their other
games of the weekend, the
Generals defeated Hampden-
Sydney by the lopsided score of
27-2, and rolled over the U.N.C.
‘“‘A”’ and “‘B” squads by scores
of 16-4 and 15-0.

These four games comprised
the second half of a tournament
that began two weeks before at
Richmond, and the Generals
trailed the Spiders by one game
coming into the weekend. Both
the W&L and Richmond teams
ended the tourney with seven
wins and one loss, but due to the

great number of goals scored by
the Generals as opposed to

goals against, W&L is the tour-
nament victor.

The Richmond game started
off ominously for the Generals,
as the Spiders jumped out to a

quick 20 lead in the first
quarter. W&L called a quick
time out, made some rear-
rangements in their offense,
and came back to take a 4-3 lead
at halftime. Despite the initial
two goals by Richmond, the
Generals appeared to be play-
ing a tighter, more determined,
and more cooperative defense
than has yet been seen this
year. Defender Bob Marshall
had an excellent game and was
what Coach Page Remillard

called ‘very effective’ in
aiding the W&L effort.
The two teams traded goals in

the third period, and with the
Generals in the lead 5-4 entering
the fourth period, the Spiders
seemed to lose some of their
composure and made critical
errors. Richmond committed

- numerous fouls and was forced

to play a man short in several
situations. They also allowed
two penalty shots, and thus suf-
fered a 9-4 defeat at the hands of
the Generals.

In citing outstanding players
for the weekend, Coach
Remillard named almost
everyone, down to the company

that makes the water polo balls,
but he was particularly pleased
with Marshall, junior Steve
Laprade, who played well as a
release man, and freshman
goalie Andy Gates, who earned
the tag “‘superb.” Junior Cap-
tain Mike Bernot directed the
offense and accumulated a
team high of 14 points for three

‘games, four of which came

against Richmond.

Remillard and his team were
also quite pleased with the
vocal and participatory crowd
that packed the pool gallery for
Said

the Richmond game.

  

Remillard, ‘““We were glad they
were there; they certainly
helped quench our thirst for vic-
tory,” and he offered a large
“HOOOYA, TOOOYAA” to the
.fans.

Next weekend the Generals
host the Virginia State Tourna-
ment, which will include many
of the same teams as last
week’s notably Richmond. The

tourney will be held on Sat. and
Sun., with W&L taking on Rich-
mond at 5 p.m. Saturday.

Freshman’s Guide

 

On The Road To Baldwin

For one reason or another,
many Washington and Lee
students do not make the drive
north: on Route 81 to Mary
Baldwin women’s college in
Staunton. Students at W&L
seem apathetic about one of the
most spirited colleges in the
area, yet has not been given a
nickname that we can print
without getting in trouble. It
seems the only time Minks go to
Baldwin is after all the other
schools and dates leave the
state for the summer. Then
there is no choice.

The drive to Baldwin is about
as exciting as grits. Route 81 is
boring and the fact the drive is
short is its only saving grace.
Upon arriving in Staunton, it is
not too difficult to find a parking
space, though one generally has
to know someone in the dorms
to get in. More so than at the

other schools, male guests haye
to be escorted at all times in the
dorms and it is difficult to
roam. If the average Mink is
fortunate enough to get a date
or happens to know someone at
Baldwin, the best thing to do is
grab her and hit one of the local
bars. The Red Line is an ex-
cellent place to stop for a drink.
Baldwin also has parties in the
Staunton Military Academy, a
building best described as too
big for a small party and too
small for a big party. Some

. have compared the hall to a

ceramic barn. Unlike some
other Mink party spots,
Baldwin has been known to
serve cold beer, though there is
seldom enough. But Baldwin
has also served minors and
there were major repercussions
with the State Board of Alcohol
Control. Try not to get caught
drinking on campus or within a

hundred miles of the ABC in-
spectors, wherever they are.

There is really only one thing
that makes Baldwin different
from any other school in the
area; the sidewalks are heated
in the winter. Unfortunately,
they are probably the only
warm things in the area. Minkss
can also compete with Wahoos,,
Hampsters and Keydets at
Baldwin. The strange thing is,
one quickly discovers how
similar the schools really are,
and how Minks, Wahoos, Vee-
Mees, and Hampsters are real-
ly after the same thing.

Probably the best way to
remember a trip to Baldwin is
to stop and eat at White’s Truck
‘Stop. Most students at W&L will
tell you that the food at White’s
is better than the parties at
Baldwin. But White’s doesn’t
have heated sidewalks.

 

Devil’s Disciple

Tom Conners, who’ll go far if he can keep a
‘straight face, was quite plausible as-the slow-
‘ witted bumpkin of a brother with whom Our Hero
is saddled (sound familiar? ). Jeff Wells, represen-
ting both Church and State — we promise not to
tell the Supreme Court — is a trifle campy, but
quite enjoyable.

And now — ruffles and flourishes, please — we
come to Al Gordon, who had to pull double duty
opening night by taking over the role of Uncle
Titus in the absence of Carter McNeese. As Uncle
Titus, Gordon is greased lightning — literally, for
the role flits but briefly across the stage and re-
quires the actor to pack sixteen centuries of
hereditary corruption and general oiliness into a
few seconds of dramatic life. And as the aptly
named ‘Gentleman Johnny” Burgoyne, Gordon
succeeds in actually stealing scenes from young
Kukucka — perhaps the only one who could. The
man doubtless prepared for the role by watching
‘Firing Line’? — he plays Burgoyne the way
William Buckley plays Buckley: the supra-mobile
face; the distaste for vulgarity — including the
word “vulgar”; the drawl; the overall,
aristocratic long-leggedness. A bravura perfor-
mance.

And — this is a pleasure — we come at last to the
delectable Nancy Stone. The lady was lovely-in
every sense of the word, her performance not least

 

(continued from page 4)

of all. It has been too long since we have seen such
projection. For a few brief hours, the distinction
between the Real and the Stage was non-existent.

Richard Boaz, who begins his demanding role as
the clerical embodiment of Extreme Unction and
must end it as a colonial Charlemagne...does.
That bespeaks no mean degree of skill. Laurie
Price as Essie the serving girl is quite a convinc-
ing peasant, Anthony Wallace is all we could wish
as the circumstantially pompous Major Swindon,
and Drew Perkin’s exquisitely played Sergeant
left us musing on Wellington’s assessment of his
infantry: ‘‘The scum of the earth, sir, the scum of
the earth.’’ Keith Shillington’s dignified portrayal
of Uncle Will charmed us, Laura de Maria and
Rose Gordon (whom Bernard Shaw wisely did not
promise us — she is a special treat whose presence
is yet another thing for which we thank Mr.
Mogavero) left us beaming, and the British
soldiers lived up to Swindon’s and Nelson’s expec-
tion by doing their duty. ;

If you go to see the play — and we think you
MUST — pay special attention to the reading of

Saga Of Georgia Professor
Transcends Boundaries Of Justice

by Jack Sharman

Hey kids, it’s time to once again play everybody’s favorite game,
Pin The Tail On The Sex Discriminator! In our shining republic’s
Long March towards an egalitarianism tackier than anybody else’s
egalitarianism, there have been suits brought against those accus-
ed of: discriminating against blacks, against whites, against
Chicanos, lesbians, homosexuals, the elderly, the young, girls be-
ing on football teams, boys being in Girl Scouts, men joining
sororities, and, unfortunately, against alcoholics.

But the golden issue is that of discrimination against women. Ah,
Feminism! How lightly the winds of enlightenment blow ’gainst
they indignant breasts! The answer, gentlemen, is simple:
mobilize Sweet Briar, and we shall never have to worry again about
the Red Chinese. The feminist movement has, of course, plumbed
the Marianas Trench of foolishness, but now the Cause has fostered
a serious development: the imprisonment of an innocent man.

James Dinnan is a professor of education at the University of
Georgia. This week, he was released from jail after serving ninety
days, before which he paid a $3,000 fine. For what noxious activity?
For refusing to reveal how he voted ata peer-review session that
considered faculty members up for tenure. On a vote of six to three,
the Georgia review committee turned down the application for
tenure of Maija Blaubergs, which constituted her third failure in
three years. Ms. Blaubergs is a psycholinguist and, naturally, what
else could a dignified female psycholinguist do, save file a
suit charging sex discrimination?

Wilbur Owens Jr. was the federal district court judge who heard
the case. Judge Owens, no doubt, eats Wheaties. This ain’t a case of
academic freedom, boy, Judge Owens intoned betweeen mouthfuls.

 

 

“Bll Rise"

You’re withholding evidence from me, under the Civil Rights Act of
1964. Dinnan adamantly refused to say how he voted, but asked, “If
academic freedom is not the right to judge one’s peers free from

outside pressure or intimidation, then what is it?’’ To this I could
not find His Honor’s reply, so I assume he opened another cereal
box. Owens fined Dinnan $100 a day for thirty days, then threw him
in jail. The case will go before the Fifth Circuit.

The question of Blaubergs per se can be disposed of with relative
ease. The University of Georgia’s vice-president for academic af-
fairs is a woman: Virginia Trotter, who was at one time Assistant
Secretary for Education at HEW. She said:

“T chaired the final review committee, and I feel Blaubergs had
every chance every step of the way. Over a three-year period, her
case was reviewed by nine committees. She did not present convin-
cing evidence of her teaching skills, and she displayed no sense of
growth in her academic specialty. (Time, October 6, 1980).”’

Apparently, Maija Blaubergs lacks sufficient competence to be
awarded tenure, and her suit is petty from its inception. Such ques-
tions as tenure are between Blaubergs and her fellow faculty
members.

A more important question is: What in the hell is Judge Wilbur
“Wheaties” Owens Jr. doing in there? The Civil Rights Act of 1964
is an important and wide-ranging document; it does not, however,
give ‘‘Wheaties’’ the right to toss a professor in the clink because
that professor refused to disclose how he voted in a private meeting
over an academic question, the privacy of that meeting being a
prerequisite for achieving the very impartiality Blaubergs and
“Wheaties” purpose to champion. Hell, let the media televise

_Teview committees from now on, with Barbara Walters mumbling

profundities on the sidelines, between cameo flashbacks, in color,
of Bella Abzug’s pubescent years. The saga of Blaubergs, Dinnan,

- and ‘‘Wheaties”’ transcends the boundaries of ‘‘justice” and makes

eyes at another title, that of “ubiquitous and _ tyrannical
foolishness.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK |

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Vote ‘NO’ Once

For three days next week the Student Body will
have a chance to update a student body constitution
which Executive Committee President Bob Willis ad-
mits is ‘‘six years out of date.’’ We urge students to
vote for all of these admendments, except one.

Once again, the Ring-tum Phi finds itself at odds
with the Executive Committee on the subject of the
Publications Board. Last year the Executive Commit-
tee saw fit to remove money from the Publications
Board Reserve Fund — an account the EC has no
right or power to touch. The EC returned the money
the next week, but one still must question exactly
what the Committee had in mind and if pressure from
the student body brought the money back to the Pub
Board. In another instance the Executive Committee
violated its own Constitution and the Publications
Board Constitution by taking salaries away from stu-
dent editors. The EC also failed to inform any other
editors that the matter was to be discussed.

We have no reason to believe anyone on the Ex-
ecutive Committee is trying to take over Ring-tum
Phi, CALYX, or Ariel — yet at the same time we see a
disturbing trend in which the EC goes out and takes
what it wants. This is apparent in the EC’s perfor-
mance of its administrative duties, the honor code im-
plications are frightening. If the Executive Commit-
tee cannot interpret a simple constitution, how can it
conduct an honor hearing?

The Executive Committee has asked to change its
power of appellate review over the publications to a
power of review. Jim Vines, the EC’s representative
to the Publications Board cast the only dissenting
vote. The one peron on the EC to have some ex-
perience with the Publications Board voted against
the Admendment. We think you should do the same.
We do not want the Student Body President writing
editorials nor directly influencing the editorial policy
of the newspaper. The Executive Committee has
deservedly been granted a large measure of power,
but it would be foolish to place the one autonomous
campus publication which can check this power under
the EC’s direct review.

Them Lexington Blues

Dear Editor:

I would like to address my
statements to anyone who has
been suffering from a case of
the Lexington blues. As a junior
here at W&L I’ve witnessed
numerous cases of this
disorder, especially among the
GDI’s. The L. blues find their
way into a suitable host via a
bored and restless mental con-
dition, usually in conjunction

with weekends. Symptomatic of
this illness is a gloomy, cynical

and sarcastic outlook on life in

the W&L community. Lexington
blues can lead to chronic
depression and _ discontent,
lasting up to four years in their
most extreme form.

To those of you who believe
themselves to suffer from this
grave malady, let me recom-
mend a generous dosage of

EC President Explains
Admendment Purpose

Dear Editor,

Last Monday evening, the Ex-
ecutive Committee proposed a
series of revisions for the Stu-
dent Body Constitution. The
purpose of these amendments is
to clarify ambiguous language
and to bring into harmony the
constitution and the current
operating procedures of student
government agencies.

For an amendment to be
adopted, at least one-half of the
student body must vote and two-
thirds of those voting must ap-
prove the proposal. Therefore,

the Executive Committee not
only urges all students to vote,
but also encourages them to
support its proposals. .

Students may vote at the
Registrar’s Office, the
Freshman Dormitories, or
Lewis Hall from Tuesday,
November 4, through Thursday,
November 6. Details of the
specific proposals are in this
week’s Executive Committee
minutes.

Thank you. Sincerely,
Robert H. Willis, Jr.
President

preferably in the presence of
feminine company. You don’t
have to be a nature freak,
physical fitness buff or even a
biology major to enjoy the
beautiful vista from House Mt.,
North Mt. or the Appalachian

canoe down the James River.
For the more robust there are
plenty of good rock-climbing
areas to limber up. In fact, just
about anything you could want
to do outdoors is available in
Virginia near Lexington.

So, if you’re tired of partying

In addition, it should be men-

Spectator and Homecoming

“And the Homecoming Queen is...” ...Boo!

ting averages. The second and most common use

Hiss! Boo! I think I’m going to be sick. Is this a
cruel joke or is this just Washington and Lee? At
any rate, the mock beauty has her crown; the
great mock weekend is over; the grand parties

and wild weekends are but distant memories. The

fraternities are broke. But do not despair, for this
is springtime in the wooded hills of Lexington.
Yes, for one short week Washington and Lee is tru-
ly an exciting place. For this is mink week, or
mink-mating season, and all our furry friends
come inside when they bed down for the winter.

A few premature minks have already come in-
side, but this only a small problem. The majority
have stayed the urge; the warm caverns will be
truly inviting...a fine reward and deserved climax
to a bitter cold fall. Now the Lexington mink
(prideless fninkus) is a curious creature. He’s on-

ly fifteen inches long, but he has an eight inch tail,
which can be used in a number of ways.

First, since the tail is so long and wide, minks
are fine ball players and most have excellent bat-

is to show affection by the tail’s elevation and
rigidity. The mink also uses his tail to deceive his
mate. Since the rear and front of the beast are so
similar in size, shape, and fluffiness, the mink, if
he does not want a kiss to the lips, just offers his
flaccidtail. This maneuver requires great skill and
dexterity, though, as the female has been known to
take a bite or two. Perhaps you have heard of the
ring-tailed mink. In most cases, however, the
male mink is instantly affected and demonstrates
this with a corresponding elevation of the tail.

Now I hesitate to deccribe the fourth and last
use, but since this is mating season, I feel my
words have a certain biolosical necessity. After
all, you do want to know how it’s done, and we
don’t want any unsatisfied minxettes at the end of

the week. Well, the mink raises his turgid tail, and
with pronounced anal movements, he secretes a
powerful, rancid effluvium, which permeates the
female’s nasal orifice. This basically knocks her
out cold, whereupon the male does with her as he
pleases.
Briar Blasts Dwyer

A news article appeared in
The Sweet Briar News on Oc-

tober 9 which recounted the,

event of Sweet Briar women
protesting at Ronald Reagan
Headquarters in Lynchburg.
The article states that: ‘‘The
main reason for the protest was
against Jerry Falwell and the
fact Ronald Reagan would use
him to advance his political
standing.”’

The article also states:
“Jerry Falwell and Ronald
Reagan are both against the
ERA and that was another ele-
ment that inspired the protest.”’

The Sweet Briar News
received a letter to the editor
from Kevin B. Dwyer, W&L ’81,
which appears in the October 16
issue. Mr. Dwyer expresses his
concern over the protest and
begins his letter: ‘‘I was sur-
prised to read of a Sweet Briar
student protest at Republican
Headquarters in Lynchburg
against Ronald Reagan for his
Friday, October 3 visit to Liber-
ty Baptist College.”

Well, Mr. Dwyer, if you had
read the article carefully
perhaps you would have had a
better understanding of what
“the main reason for the protest
was...’’ I would like to question
your ‘‘surprise’’ — does it really
surprise you that some people
don’t share the same opinions
you do? Colleges today are sup-
posed to offer a different point
of view in the classroom — for-
tunately Sweet Briar does.

d

 

Mr. Dwyer proceeds in his let-
ter to point out several points
where Mr. Falwell and Gover-
nor Reagan disagree on issues.
The Sweet Briar women were
not protesting the fine lines of
political jargon, they were pro-
testing Ronald Reagan using
Falwell to advance his political
standing, as stated in the arti-
cle.

The letter from Mr. Dwyer
quotes a passage from the
Republican platform about
women. He also states how he
feels about the ERA. It is very
presumptuous of Mr. Dwyer to
think the women who par-
ticipated in the protest are not
aware of the facts. Mr. Dwyer
refers to his 19-year-old sister
having to register for the draft
if the ERA is passed. Frankly, I
don’t see what his sister has to
do with either article.

Mr. Dwyer says: “I was in
Detroit. Let me explain it to
you.” I find this holier-than-
thou attitude condescending,
and again Mr. Dwyer’s
presence in Detroit has nothing
to do with how some Sweet
Briar women feel about the
ERA.

Does he honestly feel that be-
ing at the Republican Conven-
tion gives him better insights to
political ideals?

magazines and newspapers also
give an accurate account of
representing issues to those
who are unable to attend con-
ventions. The point of a

newspaper is to present the
facts, not to dictate opinions.
Obviously Mr. Dwyer has dif-
ficulty in discerning between

. the two.

In closing, Mr. Dwyer ques-
tions: “Isn’t attending a school
which excludes’ men
discriminating against them?”
and adds he believes that Sweet
Briar and W&L should stay
single sex — another non se-
quitur vis-a-vis the ten women
who expressed their opinion in a
quiet demonstration.

In any case, the article on Oc-
tober 9 was a news article and it
is not my place to put my opi-
nion in what was a factual ac-
count of an event that related to
the Sweet Briar campus.
Freedom of speech and
freedom of the press are na-
tional laws, and I am “‘surpris-
ed”’ that Mr. Dwyer is ‘‘surpris-
ed” by an opinion that differs
from his norm. I suggest that
Mr. Dwyer explore the realms
outside of Lexington more often
and see that there are a myriad
of people expressing various
different views.

The Sweet Briar News will
continue to report the news
without any judgmental over-
tones, and Sweet Briar women
will continue to exercise their
rights as free thinking in-
dividuals.

Response To Response

Dear Editor:

John Vlohoplus’s critique

about voting in the 10/23/80
Ring-tum Phi rang harmlessly
hollow, but unfortunately, so do
the heads of many who would
read him and be misled by his
superficial ‘‘analysis.”’

The democratic process in
itself is impotent and irrelevant
to questions of political ethics.
Democratic process is no more
than one particular mechanism
for selecting employees to
carry out the principles upon

, which a government is based,

and it is upon these principles
which that government must be
judged.

The principles of the US.
government were originally
contained in its Constitution,
but it is clear from the actions
of that government that its Con-
stitution has long ago been
spurned and is paid only the
most nominal lipservice. Every
major concept therein has been
distorted (i.e. rights, freedom,
etc.), and every key sentence
has been stretched in supposed
meaning beyond the point of
recognizability. This can be
most clearly seen in the opi-
nions of the very judges who
were appointed to protect the
sanctity- of this phenomenal
work of legal science and
political philosophy. Even the
most basic tenants of legal due
process have been subverted.
The principle that a man is in-
nocent until proven guilty, with
the burden of proof falling
always on the state has been

clearly violated by the nature of

antitrust laws, trials and legal
guidelines. Note, also, that the
Supreme Court has recently
upheld the principle that a
whole industry can be held
liable for the malpractices of
one firm. This is an outrage and
in flagrant disregard of justice.

A democracy without the
foundation of a clear and intran-
sigently respected set of
political and legal principles to
define and delimit the nature
and scope of its actions is reduc-
ed to no more than arbitrary
gang-rule. Such a government
is a massive headless monster,
left free to run amuck through a
society, trampling the lives,
freedom and property of
countless human beings. In this
case, a democracy is no less
totalitarian than a dictatorship,
with the exception that the
despot there is clearly responsi-
ble for any _ injustice
perpetrated; he has no means
to bury that responsibility and
cower behind a maze of com-
mittees, votes, and
bureaucratic blind alleys as
does despot in a democracy. ‘‘A
commitment to the democratic
process,’’ along is, morally, a
null concept; and such policy is
not to be left to the arbitrary
power of employees, but is to be
outlined in an inviolate code of
principles such as the U.S. Con-
stitution.

I repeat from my previous
analysis. When any government
adopts a set of principles (even
if blindly, by default) which
allows any one, including the
government itself, to violate in-
dividual rights with impunity;
then that government deserves
the type of condemnation ra-
tional beings have for any
criminal, only multiplied by the
several orders of magnitude by
which the scope of such institu-
tionalized crime outsizes the
violations of the criminal.

To vote in a democratic pro-
cess, is only to participate in the
hiring of civil employees, and it
presupposes that the principles
which control those employees
are clearly presented, moral
and upheld with ruthless
justice. If this is not the case,
the vote is, indeed, the sanction
of the victim,

arose at the end of the year.

‘The increase basically pro-
vides for any disaster at the end
of the year,’’ Willis said.

Eric Myers expressed con-
cern whether it was necessary
to increase the fund by $1500
and asked if it might be better
to instead allocate a percentage
of student taxes in order to in-
crease the fund.

But Willis said it is easier for
the committee to increase the
reserve by appropriating
money directly from the EC and
the proposal passed unaminous-
ly.

Three amendments pertain-
ing to the Publications Board
were accepted by the commit-
tee. Proposal number 10 would
ease restrictions governing
membership on the board by
allowing students to serve on
the Pub Board.

The constitution now states
that the board ‘‘shall be com-
posed of all editors and business
managers, and all former
editors and business managers
still students.”

Two other amendments that
the committee proposes would
change the wording of Article 5,
Section G thus establishing the
EC’s “‘power of review of the
Publication Board ...”’. The con-
_ Stitution now defines the com-
mittee’s power over the Pub

Board as appellate jurisdiction.
The final proposal would in-
crease the board’s reserve fund
form $2500 to $4000 and divert
all net profits from university
publications to the fund.

In other business, Willis
swore in the two new members
of the EC. Freshman represen-
tative Ben Hale was elected
over George Weatherly in last

week’s run-off and first-year
law representative Michael
Nogay defeated Ken Ter-
willeger.

The next EC meeting is at
6:30 p.m. on Monday. Student
security in Lexington and the
recent increase in violent crime
will be the main topic at the
meeting, which is open to all
students.

Senator Stevenson won a battle
against Senator Ralph Smith
over the seat left vacant by the
death of Senator Everett
Dirksen. Stevenson was re-
elected in 1974, and is Chairman
of the Senate Ethics Commit-
tee. In addition, he is a member
of the Senate Democratic
Policy Committee, the Commit-
tee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs, the Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence Affairs,
and the Commerce Committee.

A graduate of Harvard and
Harvard Law School, Senator
Stevenson served as com-
mander of a tank platoon in
Japan and Korea. He is married
to the former Nancy Anderson
of Louisville. They have four
children.

Richard §. Schweiker, a
Republican, is Pennsylvania’s

Senator. Senator Schweiker
was Ronald Reagan’s Vice-
Presidential running mate in
1976. His political career began
when he was elected to the Con-
gress in 1960, and he was re-
elected in 1962, 1964, and 1966.
He entered the Senate in 1968
with an upset victory over
Senator Joseph S. Clark. Cur-
rently, Senator Schweiker is the
ranking Republican on both the
Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee, and the
Senate’s Labor-HEW Ap-
propriations Subcommittee.

A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of

IRVING R. LEVINE

Balanced Budget
Tough Task

by Frank Billingsley

Emphasizing that it will be
“exceedingly difficult’ for
Ronald Reagan to attain a
balanced budget, NBC
Economic correspondent Irving
R. Levine spoke on the ‘U.S.
Economy and the election’
from Lee Chapel at Washington
and Lee University Tuesday
night.

Noting that the Reagan Ad-
ministration will be faced with
a $59 billion federal budget
deficit next year, Levine warn-
ed that the President-elect’s
plans to increase defense spen-
ding and cut taxes could result
in as large a deficit next year.

Levine said that “‘the tax cuts
proposed by Reagan would in-
evitably make inflation worse.”
He suggested that inflation
should be dealt with by tax in-
centives that encourage invest-
ment and job opportunity, but
that, due to campaign pro-
mises, Reagan is ‘‘stuck’’ with
inflationary tax cuts.

“We may experience a W-
shaped economic recovery,”

 

MICHAEL D. BARTINI

    

Levine said. He noted that the
Reagan administration may
come into office with another
dip taking place in the reces-
sion.

Levine said the Reagan
economic assistants are deter-
mined to ‘‘move ahead on the

economic front,’’ although he
did not have much encourage-

ment for their success.
Reagan advisers have sug-
gested a freeze in government

Pi Kappa Phi Punished For

Hazing National Secretary

by Mike Perry

The Interfraternity Council
Judicial Board levied a five-
part punishment against the Pi
Kappa Phi fraternity Tuesday.
The punishment includes two
months social probation and
suspension from intramural
competition for the remainder
of the school year, for “‘hazing”’
a traveling national fraternity
representative.

The national fraternity
representative. is also consider-
ing possible legal action against

individuals he thinks were in-:
volved in the incident.

Pi Phi Field Secretary Mike
Willis read a detailed account of
how he was ‘kidnapped’ by
fraternity freshmen. Willis re-
counted how he arrived at the
Pi Phi house last Tuesday after-
noon for a scheduled visit and
presented fraternity president
Clyde Harkrader with the
chapter’s 1980 composite which
he had found on a visit to Drexel
University in Philadelphia.

Willis says he was warned by
former traveling secretary

_ George Ship, now a graduate

student at the University of
Virginia, and several up-
perclassmen at dinner of the

   
 

possibility that he might be kid-
napped. At approximately 7
p.m., Willis told the IFC he was
‘jumped from behind and forc-
ed to the ground,”’ at which time
he informed the Pi Phis ‘‘that
what they were doing was il-
legal and against my will.”
Willis added that he felt the
other six or seven older frater-
nity members present en-

couraged the activity.

“IT told the guy at least three
times he might be kidnapped,”’
Pi Phi member Madison Wood-
ward said. ‘It was almost like
he was waiting for it.”’

Several Pi Phi _ represen-
tatives indicated that Willis

should have known something
was amiss when the group of
freshmen entered the room
without removing their coats
and joked about the possibility
of kidnapping Willis. ‘‘He could
have run out the back door,‘
Ted McQuiston, a Pi Phi
freshman, said.

In his testimony Willis told
the IFC how the freshmen

 

Jamie Hall, Monty Briscoe, Brian Gibson, Chip Nunley

“bound my ankles and hands
with duct tape, gagged me with
a pillow case to keep my head
down,” and ‘‘took my wallet so
as not to have it lost.”’

The Pi Phis then put a tee-
shirt on their national represen-

Amendments Fail, EC Seeks Alternitives

by Bill Whalen

Eleven constitutional amend-
ments proposed by the Ex-
ecutive Committee were re-
jected last week because a ma-
jority of the student body failed
to vote.

In its meeting on Monday
night, the EC announced that
only 22 percent of the student
body voted on the amendments.
According to the student body
constitution, at least 50 percent
of the student body must vote on

by Chris Peacock

A number of Washington and
Lee upperclassmen feel that
they are coming up short on the
financial aid stick. But Michael
D. Bartini, director of financial
aid, says that the problem is
Uncle Sam’s fault.

Students on financial aid are
getting less money each year
they are here from the Basic
Educational Opportunity
Grants (BEOG). Senior Bill
Towler, a second year dorm
counselor, has seen his BEOG
total drop $320 in four years. In

an amendment to make it of-
ficial.

‘Obviously, something has to
give with this situation,’ said
Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Willis. ‘Certain
policies which needed to pass
did not, and some of these
policies should not have to wait
until the spring to be decided.”

Senior EC Senior Represen-
tative Jim Vines stated his
displeasure with the results of
the vote. ‘‘One problem was the

that period, tuition increased
from $3,100 to $4,050. Towler’s
overall package increased by
$1,080, but the balance came in
the form of loans and, this year,
a work-study job in the Admis-
sions Office. This is in addition
to the parents’ expected con-
tribution (determined by the
College Scholarship Service in
Princeton, N.J.) and the stu-
dent’s expected contribution.
This ranges from approximate-
ly $500 freshman year to ap-
proximately $700 senior year.
Towler, like many others in

way people voted,”’ said Vines.
“If they even bothered to look at
the list, and if they were in-
terested, they would either cir-
cle a whole line or vote on only a
few issues.”’

Vines went on to say that an
alternative way of voting should
be employed. ‘‘We need a public
forum on the amendments,”
said Vines. ‘Too many of the
voters went into it blind.”

Sophomore Representative
Pete Baumgartner also gave

similar situations, feels that is a
great deal of money for him to
be expected to pay, as it takes
most of his summer earnings.
Also, he is incurring a substan-
tial debt to be repaid after he
graduates. So, to help make
ends meet, Towler has worked
in the dining hall for most of his
four years at W&L. Being a
dorm counselor provides him
with a free room and one free
meal a day. Now, because of
federal regulations that are be-
ing imposed this year for the

lot of people claimed they didn’t
have the time to vote,’”’ said
Baumgartner, ‘‘and they just
walked away.’’ ‘‘A lot of people
said they didn’t want anything
to do with it because there was
too much bureaucratic. red
tape.”

Baumgartner, who worked at
the polls, claimed he was told
by several voters that the
amendments were the duty of

Board Approves
Housing Changes

One-year changes in patterns
of student housing at
Washington and Lee University
for 1981-82 were approved last
weekend by W&L’s board of
trustees as the first formal step
in a plan that will lead to a com-
plete renovation ofthe Graham-
Lees freshman dormitory.

The actual plans for remodel-
ing the “old dorms’”’ are .a-
pected to be approved by the
W&L board at its meeting in
February or May. The board
authorized preparation of work-
ing drawings and_ project
specifications last spring. Cost
figures on the 15-month renova-
tion, however, have not yet been
developed.

Next year’s W&L freshmen
will be housed in the universi-
ty’s upperclass dorm, Davis; in
the law students’ dorm, Baker;
in a house on Lee Avenue owned
by the university and now used
for housing upperclassmen;
and in rooms on three floors of
the Robert E. Lee Hotel in
downtown Lexington that W&L
will lease for the school year. In
all these facilities and in the
university's other freshman
dorm, Gilliam, freshmen will
live two to a room. Normally,
all the rooms in the law and up-
perclass dorms and most in the
freshman dorms are singles.

The students who otherwise
would have lived next year in

the upperclass and law dorms
or in the Lee Avenue house will
be given preference for vacan-
cies in other university-owned
housing, notably Davidson Park
on East Nelson Street, where
married students now
predominate, and in the Wood’s
Creek Apartments between the
new undergraduate library and
Lewis Hall, W&L’s law school.
The university has also arrang-
ed for limited off-campus hous-
ing to help meet upperclass and
law students’ needs.

and ‘I’m a fag, suck me,”’ ac-
cording to Willis.

Willis says a ‘“‘period of

tial, will begin as soon as the
current school year ends in May
and will be completed just in
time for the beginning of
classes in September 1982.

The Lee dorm was completed
in 1904, and the Graham in 1920.
In 1941 they both were com-
pletely renovated and remodel-
ed and were connected by addi-
tion of a middle wing to form a
U-shaped complex at the
southwest edge of the campus
area.

The Graham-Lees_ dor-
mitory now houses 241
freshmen and 16 upperclass
counselors. After the remodel-
ing the number of students it
will accommodate will be
slightly fewer because of
necessary space_ re-

arrangements.

Exchange Programs

Rikkyo University has
established scholarships for
students of foreign institutions
with whom they have exchange
agreements — W&L, the
University of Chicago, the
University of the South, and
Kenyon College.

Successful candidates will
receive an initial grant of
$1300-1500 upon arrival in Japan
and a $400-500 monthly living
allowance. Tuition is waived
under the existing exchange
program.

Several approaches for W&L
students who may consider
study at Rikkyo are possible:

1. Independent study on a
wide range of subjects under

harassment” then followed in
which he was covered with
shaving cream, peanut butter
and cologne. At this point Willis
says he managed to peek out
from under his blindfold and
observe president Clyde
Harkrader as the fraternity
members paused to take pic-
tures.

Later in the meeting
Harkrader admitted that the in-
cident ‘‘was definitely hazing,
but things did not happen as
violently as he (Willis) por-
trayed them,’’ and_ that
“brothers did not encourage the
pledges”’ at the time of the ab-
duction.

The Pi Phi freshmen then car-
ried Willis to a car and drove
him to the upper practice fields.
“They carried me over to a
short hill and rolled me down it.
I stopped myself after three
revolutions and they rolled me
some more,”’’ Willis said.

Freshman Ted McQuiston
told the IFC that Willis’ ‘‘kid-
nappers” told him that there
was a stream at the bottom of
the hill.

Willis told the IFC Judicial
Board that the Pi Phis then
drove him to the VMI parade
ground, placed him in a blanket
and left, instructing three
cadets who happened on the
scene to harass him. McQuiston
says the freshmen expected the
cadets to aid Willis and left only
after they saw the ‘VMI guys
untying him.”

Willis said VMI cadets Mark
F. Burmenschemkel, David B.
Openshew and Floyd Allen
helped him free himself and
remove the duct tape from his

hair. Returning to the Pi Phi
fraternity house at 9 p.m.,
Willis says he encountered no
one and left after he found his
wallet in Harkrader’s room.

The Pi Phi national represen-
tative went on to tell the IFC
that he did not consider the con-
duct of the individuals involved
in his abduction ‘‘characteristic
of a W&L student, a fraternity
man (especially a Pi Kappa Phi
member) or any other form of
human life I know.”

“I was here to help and did
nothing to provoke this action,”’
Willis said.

Harkrader explained to the
IFC that none of the Pi Phis had
anything against Willis per-
sonally.

The Pi Phi president added
that he was surprised by such a
“big over-reaction to a tradi-
tional prank” and ‘‘was pretty
much floored by this kind of
reaction to something that had
been going on for twenty
years.”

Gray Coleman, a '79 W&L
graduate and former Pi Phi, ad-
ded that the ‘‘traditional
prank” has ‘“‘been around as
long as I can remember’’ and
that while freshmen are never
instructed to kidnap visitors
from the national organization,
‘they hear about it.’’ ‘‘This is to
some degree more severe than
anything I have heard before,”
Coleman added.

Willis went on to explain the
“‘seriousness”’ of what happen-
ed and read from the Virginia
Penal Code the definition of ab-
duction and kidnapping. Willis
stated that the Pi Kappa Phi na-
tional organization will con-
sider possible’ punitive
measures against the W&L Pi
Phis after any actions taken by
the IFC or possible legal action
taken by Willis who added that
he wants “‘some positive out-
come.”’

Willis contends that he knew
of past incidents involving na-
tional representatives visiting
the W&L Rho chapter. ‘“‘These

guys are definitely anti-
national,’’ Willis said.

The Pi Phi Field Secretary
suspects this feeling may also
be shared by the Pi Phi’s facul-
ty adviser, Holt Merchant, who
is also faculty adviser to the
IFC.

Willis explained that he
telephoned Merchant Tuesday
evening at home to tell nim or
the incident and was told by
Merchant that he couldn’t talk
to Willis because he was in the
middle of watching an opera on
television.

Willis says he found Mer-
chant’s response ‘‘exemplary of
the chapter attitude,’ and
“shows an anti-national at-
titude tied in with the incident, I
believe.”’ Willis added that he
found Merchant’s attitude
much more ‘‘positive’’ the next
morning after he had learned of
the incident.

After hearing Willis’
testimony, Pi Phi represen-
tatives questioned his percep-
tion of several details of the in-
cident, but did not challenge his
version of what took place.

After deliberating for nearly
an hour, the IFC Judicial Board
outlined a five-part punishment
designed ‘“‘to reprimand quite
stringently’’ the Pi Phis ‘‘for a
gross violation of gentlemanly
conduct.” IFC President Monty
Briscoe then read a statement
calling for 1) a suspension of the
fraternity’s intramural _ par-
ticipation for the rest of the
year, 2) two months social pro-
bation, 3) active participation
by all Pi Phi members in com-
munity service through the
University Federation, 4) let-
ters of explanation and apology
to the Pi Kappa Phi national of-
fice and Mike Willis, ‘‘assuring
the discontinuance of such ac-
tions,’’ and 5) maintenance of a
closer relationship with the Pi
Phi national organization.

Mike Willis declined to com-
ment as to whether he planned
to inituate any legal action in
light of the IFC decision.

Antebellum Residence To Be Restored

by Robert S. Keefe
Three houses for professors
and one for the President were
authorized in April 1841 by the
board of trustees of Washington
College (Washington and Lee

University from 1871) — out of .

the belief that the presence of
the faculty ‘‘on the coHege
premises will have a restrain-
ing and improving effect on the
students incalculably more im-
portant than any other step that
could be taken for the manage-
ment of the institution.”’

But there was a problem
—money. (Plus ca change...)

The college couldn't afford
the cost of the houses — all of
$3,500 each.

The hitch was_ resolved,

however, when three of the pro- -

fessors agreed to pay for the
houses themselves, on the con-
dition that the college would
buy them back over a six-year
period for what they cost
(without even interest). The
professors even agreed to begin

 

«
s

paying rent to the college as

soon as the college had bought
the houses that the same pro-
fessors had subsidized.

“They were placed on the
grounds in such a way as to
form an architectural composi-
tion with the rest of the
buildings.” All four houses were
of the same general design:
two-story temple form with por-
ticoes, flanked by one-story
wings. The outside houses in
each pair at both ends of the
campus ‘had hipped roofs sur-
rounded in each case by a low
parapet. (The parapets have
long since disappeared. ) The in-
ner houses in each pair were

given pedimented roofs and |

gable-roof wings.

‘Almost no attempt was
made to decorate the interiors
of the houses. All the woodwork
was of the plainest type.
However, the mantels and door

enframements, as well as the:

doors themselves, had a very
Greek Revival feeling in their
almost-refined simplicity....The
building committee wished to
maintain the Classical style in-
troduced (in 1824) by (John)
Jordan in the Centre Building.”’

“While the Tuscan column
capitals in the porticoes of these
houses have the same odd pro-
portions as the order of the Cen-
tre Building, their bases were
made more academically cor-
rect with the addition of extra
molding bands. There is nothing

 

Tuition Raised To $4,800

_ The. comprehensive . tuition
fee at Washington and Lee

University will be $4,800 next -

year. Rae

The university’s. board of
trustees approved the figure at
its regular autumn meeting on
the campus Saturday: . -

Tuition this year is $4,050.

W&L’s policy is that: tuition
will cover approximately 60
percent of the ‘‘educational and
general’ operating budget each
year — that is, 60 percent of the
actual cost of each student’s
education. The difference is
made up chiefly through
unrestricted annual contribu-

tions from alumni and others,
earnings on permanent endow-
ment, and other gift, trust-fund
and investment income.

Next year’s increase follows
three years when the annual
rise in tuition was kept at an
average 9.3 pereent. The four-
year average thus will be 11.6
percent.

W&L’s comprehensive tuition
fee ranks as one of the lowest

among private liberal-arts col- .

leges and universities. Accor-
ding to a survey conducted
every year by Davidson Col-
lege, W&L this year is 20th
among 21 institutions surveyed
— far behind northern colleges

such .as Ambherst, Haverford
and Princeton, whose. tuition
fees exceed $6,000. W&L ‘is less
costly to attend than all
southern colleges participating

‘in the current-year Davidson

survey, including Vanderbilt,
Duke, Sewanee, Emory,
Hampden-Sydney and Davidson
itself — except Wake Forest
University.

The board also voted to in-
crease the university’s budget
item for student financial -aid
next year to match the tuition
hike and relieve its impact on
— receiving need-based
aid.

taken directly from the Greek
Revival style in the new houses,
but their generally heavier, less
elongated proportions and sim-
ple, almost austere details
mark the beginning of a change
(on the campus) toward this
Style of architecture. —

“Talbot Hamlin wrote in his
monumental work on the Greek
Revival (Greek Revival Architee-
turein America: New York, 1944)
that ‘the whole group with its

strong white accents of pier, .

pilaster.and column against the
red brick walls forms a
dignified monument.’ He also
called it ‘one of the most im-

pressive of (the) Southern col-.

leges.’

The brick for the houses was
made from clay dug on the cam-
pus itself. This accounts for the
unusual terracing of the front
lawn.

The campus of Washington

and Lee University ‘‘is compos-

 

 

 

 

 

ed of architecturally —har-
monious and spatially related
neo-Classical buildings that
together form one of the most

dignified and beautiful college
campuses in the Nation. The
central and most significan
element of this complex, the
Colonnade, along with the flank-
ing faculty residences, give the
impression of being the product
of a single architectural eon-
cept, but in reality this splendid
succession of columned and
pilastered buildings is an evolu-
tionary product of a building
program extending over nearly
150 years. As the school grew,
its administrators and builders
successfully:used this growth as
a means to enhance the visual

_ unity of the institution.”

have remained the visual sym-
bol and psychological heart of
this venerable institution.”’

Entertainment

 

 

In a scene from the Washington and Lee University Theatre's “An Evening of Tudor Entertainment"
are Beedle White of Lexington, William Woolfolk, a W&L freshman, Ellen Jervey, instructor of drama,
and Curtis Swisher of Fairfield. The production will be presented Nov. 18, 19, and 20 at 7 p.m. in W&L’'s

Troubadour Theatre.

 

The Washington and Lee
University Theatre will present
‘An Evening of Tudor Enter-
tainment”’ Nov. 18, 19, and 20 at
7 p.m. in the Troubadour
Theatre.

“Tudor Entertainment” is an
experimental production that
re-creates the plays of Tudor
England, which were actually
small scenes presented between
banquet courses. According to
Dr. Albert C. Gordon, professor
of drama at Washington and
Lee and director of the produc-
tion, the plays were known for
romantic, farcical and bawdy

‘Superdance’

The co-chairmen of
Washington and Lee’s Third An-
nual Superdance to benefit
those afflicted with muscular
dystrophy announced today
that registration for those who
wish to dance opens this week.

To kick off the registration ef-
fort, extensive programs will be
in effect throughout the W&L
community. There will be sec-
tional dormitory and fraternity
presentations during the next
two weeks in our attempt to en-
courage increased W&L com-
munity participation.

If you are not contacted by
either of these activites and
would like to dance, you may
register any day between 9 a.m.
and 4 p.m. with Carole Chappell

humor.

A Tudor banquet meal will be
served, and, in an attempt at
authenticity, there will be no
spoons or forks. The play
‘“Fulgens and Lucres’’ by
Henry Medwall, who was
chaplain to the Archbishop of
Canterbury, will be presented
between courses. First produc-
ed in 1497, ‘“Fulgens and
Lucres’’ is the story of a woman
who must decide whom to
marry, an aristrocratic playboy
or a virtuous poor man.

The lead roles are played by
William Woolfolk, a W&L

Announces

in the University Center.

In addition, registration at all
area women’s colleges will
begin next Monday. Senior co-
chairman J. Hemby pleads
“The W&L students need to
make a concentrated effort to
equal the expected phenomenal
turnout of participants from the
girls’ schools.”’

In an attempt to expand upon
last year’s success, there will
be many invitations this year.
Prizes will be awarded to the
top three money raising
dancers and to the dancer who
on the night of the Superdance,
presents the most ‘‘work.”
Entertainment for this year’s
event promises Tripp Brower
will also be vastly improved

freshman, as Fulgens, the
father; and Ellen Jervey, in-
structor in drama, as_ the
daughter Lucres. Carter
McNeese of Lexington and Cur-
tis Swisher of Fairfield are
suitors and Stan Nolan, a
junior, and Joel Bassett, a
sophomore, are servants.

Tickets for ‘“‘An Evening of

Tudor Entertainment” are $3
and reservations, which are re-
quired, may be made by calling
the University Theatre between
10 a.m. and 4 p.m. at 463-9111,
ext. 371.

Registration

over that in last year’s event.
Ten or more bands are expected
to grace the 30-hour fund raiser.
The co-chairmen encourage
all those interested in par-
ticipating in the Superdance to
register soon. The Thanksgiv-
ing and Christmas holidays pro-
vide excellent opportunities for
soliciting pledges. The number
of dancers will be limited this
year as there is expected a
record turnout. Hemby feels
‘*Now is an excellent chance for
the heart of the Superdance, the
W&L dancers, to make their in-
itial pledge. Please register to
dance and contribute to W&L’s
efforts to defeat muscular
dystrophic disease. Please
“dance for those who can’t.”

Carter Family Heiress

Hits Comeback Trail

If Linda Ronstadt’s a bit too
empty-headed for your taste; if
you like a lot of the country

| you’ve been hearing lately but

you're afraid to take a chance
on a whole album’s worth of the
stuff; if you’ve been searching
| for the perfect music to get you
through a Sunday morning in
Rockbridge County; or if your
tastes are somewhat outre and
you want something to play at
parties that will keep you happy
| without clearing out the room,
then Carlene Carter might be
for you. Chances are, your only
exposure to Ms. Carter to date
|has been through her co-
authorship of the title track
| from the new Doobie Brothers
| album (‘‘One Step Closer’’).
| She’s a rarity, an instinctively
| popular artist making very fine,
| mainstream, sometimes even
commercially-oriented music,

| who will never be more than a

| very minor footnote in the

history of rock’n’roll. This is
really quite inexplicable. She
has an unbelievable set of
credentials; not only does she
hail from the venerable Carter
family (Mother Maybelle
Carter’s granddaughter,
Johnny Cash’s step-daughter),
she’s also married to Nick
Lowe, and on all three of her
records she has worked closely
with the Parker/Costello/Ed-
munds/Lowe axis. She’s even
better-looking than Linda
Ronstadt!! So why does her
career seem destined to flop
before it even gets started???
The answer certainly doesn’t
lie in the music. Her first
album, Carlene Carter,
released in 1978, featured the
tastefully polished playing of
the Rumour (Graham Parker’s
band) and a passel of excellent
songs, including three fine
originals and a great remake
‘Between You and Me,”’ which
originally appeared on Parker’s
first album. This is one of those
quietly but insistently perfect
albums, the kind that stays with
you year after year. However,
despite a substantial promo-
tional push from Warner
Brothers, the album went
nowhere. The problem is that
this can probably be traced to
Warners’ failure to break a
single; the record was a bit too
pop-oriented for today’s buzz-

 

saw brand of album rock radio,
and most ‘‘top-40”’ or ‘‘contem-
porary”’ stations simply don’t
play album cuts.

Carlene attempted to rectify
this situation with on her second
album, 1: sides to Every
Woman, with unfsrtunately
| poor results. Pointless rocker .,,

some mediocre Fleetwood Ma
| ripoffs, and a disco-tinged title

cutout bins

track sunk the record, despite

two glorious moments, “Do It |

In A Heartbeat’’, co-written by
Carter and (at the time)
newlywed husband Lowe, and
Elvis Costello’s ‘‘Radio
Sweetheart.’ It wouldn’t be so
bad if the album had served its
purpose and rounded up some
fans for Carter, but, sadly, its
commercial success was equal
to its artistic merits.

One reason for the failure of
Two Sides...was an overdose of
slickness; the Rumour was
replaced by a bunch of faceless
L.A. session bets, and the glossy

sheen producers Lance Quinn |
and Tony Bongiovi laid on the |

record was far less suited to
Carter’s style than the
straightforward approach
taken by Brinsley Schwarz and
Bob Andrews on her first
album.

Coming after

Two,

Sides...,Carter’s latest, Musical |
Shapes, released just a few |

months back, looks like a major
comeback. This time out, she’s
backed by Rockpile, featuring
Dave Edmunds on guitar, and
sympathetically produced by
Lowe. On Musical Shapes
Carlene takes a whole new
direction, exploring her country
roots more explicitly than ever
before. All but three of the
songs are originals, and they’re
good ones, too. ‘“Cry’’ and
‘“‘Madness”’ have a rollicking,
rockabilly feel to them, while
“Bandit of Love’’ and ‘‘Ap-
palachian Eyes’’ are evocative
pieces that lean more toward
folk than C&W. “Baby Ride
Ease,” written by Canadian
Rich Hobson, features a

 

spirited vocal duet, with Ed-_
munds and Carter trading off

some humorously hokey lines,
and ‘‘Foggy Mountain Top,”’ an
old Carter family classic, is

respectfully updated. The only |

weak moments are ‘“‘Ring of
Fire” and ‘Too Proud,’’ on
which Carter is swamped by the
over-synthesized support of

Clover, a band she’s toured |

with, best known for backing
Elvis Costello on his first Ip.
Musical Shapes has already
died commercially, which
leaves one to wonder how long it
will be before Warners gives up

 

on Carlene. However it turns |

out in the long run, Carlene

Carter and Musical Shapes are |
highly recommended as two of |
the finest pieces of mainstream |
pop-rock to emerge in the past |
three years. So, if this descrip- |

tion intrigues you at all, you’d
better buy now, cause it won’t

W&L, Sweetbriar Groups
Spelunk in W.Va. Cavern

by Andrew Trotter

The W&L Outing Club joined
the Sweetbriar Outdoor Pro-
gram last Saturday in a
spelunking trip to Patton’s Cave
in Monroe County, West
Virginia. The combined group
of twelve students, eight from
W&L and four from Sweetbriar,
explored the cave for more than
five hours, guided by Jim
Richards, a member of the Blue
Ridge Grotto, an area caving
organization.

Richards said that the
privately-owned cave, which is
well-known to spelunkers, is a
good cave in which to learn
spelunking. The two and a half
miles of passages provide a
variety of cave conditions, with
ceilings from 1 to 30 feet high,

and with both mud slides and
rock obstacles. The group was
equipped with helmet
flashlights, which illunminated
the cave’s many beautiful
calcite formations.

After lunch at the extreme
back of the cave, Richards gave
the students an opportunity to
experience the spelunker’s
greatest challenge: finding the
way out. With Richards follow-
ing in the rear, the relatively
simple three-channel layout of
the cave suddenly appeared to
be quite intricate, because of
the numerous breakdowns, or
subdivisions in the limestone,
which make interconnected
passages appear to diverge.

Normally, a_ river flows
through the cave. But because

of the dry weather, this year the
cave is only muddy. One stu-
dent, however, managed to find
a subterranian pond and fall in-
to it.

Saturday’s trip was the se-
cond spelunking expedition for
the Outing Club. Other trips this
year have included canoeing,
backpacking and_ rock-
climbing. This Friday the Out-
door Club will go on a backpack-
ing overnighter on the Ap-
palachian Trail with the Sweet-
briar club and a group from
Randolph-Macon.

Announcements concerning
all outings are posted on cam-
pus, and all W&L students and
faculty members are welcome
to participate.

Commentary:

Fall Thoughts

by Ralph Frasca
As the fall sports season winds its way to yet another close, I feel
some compulsion to make several off-the-cuff observations on
various phenomena which, like regurgitated cat fur, defy explana-
tion. They simply exist for us to make of them what we will.

The water polo team must be applauded for the most abrupt and
welcome turnaround of any other team on this campus. Starting off
sluggishly with a young and relatively inexperienced crew, Coach
Page Remillard has unified his players into one of the best W&L
teams in recent memory. If only it weren’t for the dreaded nemesis
Richmond. Fans will have to content themselves with the slogan
‘‘Wait ‘til next year” as Brooklyn Dodgers supporters did on an an-
nual basis three decades ago. But in this case, a year may be all
that is needed.

The football team has played one nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat,
down-to-the-wire cliffhanger after another, demonstrating what
teamwork is all about. Without any major stars, the Generals have
had to rely on every member to contribute. Oh, there have been
noteworthy players, but the team has no gamebreakers, no one per-
son to be relied upon when the big play is needed. This ‘‘lack,”’ or
should I say advantage, seems to bring out the most in each player
and is frequently the characteristic of a winning football team.

Congratulations must go to the ardent W&L fans, who as any
athlete will readily admit, are like an extra man on the field of play.
When hundreds and hundreds of slightly rowdy, vociferous in-
dividuals cheer for a team, it is always conducive to inspired play.

Speaking of fans, is there anyone who did not get a miniature
plastic football? This halftime ritual never failed to provide
laughter and mayhem. On cue, a mass of otherwise outstanding
and respectable individuals were converted into a chortling throng.
With flailing arms and desperate pleas, they beseeched the
dispensers of the plastic ecstasy to smile upon them with the
ultimate munificence and launch a projectile in their direction. One
need have fast reflexes and sensitive hands, to be sure, but vast
numbers of fans were satiated. Such priceless tokens were furious-
ly coveted but, upon acquiring a mini-football, the average fan
shoved it into his/her pocket and then, after returning to the
relative security of one’s own private quarters, cast same into the
remote corners of the closet, never again to possess the magical
charm it once had.

It occurs to me that the plastic footballs were merely status sym-
bols of some sort, profusely desired but scarcely coveted upon snar-
ing one, They had no value if obtained by any means other than
plucking one from the air. It will be a very long year until plastic
footballs add spice to our lives once again.

Cross-Country Ends
On Unexpected Note

 

by John Harrison
The W&L cross country
team’s season ended last Satur-

day on an unexpected low note.
W&L was coming off of its

best over-all performance of the
year the previous Saturday at
Hampden-Sydney. In addition
to that, everyone was finally in
top-notch physical condition.
The team had peaked at the
perfect time and appeared to be
primed to cap one of its better
seasons in the last few years
with a good showing.

But this was not to be the
case. Any aspirations of going
to the NCAA Qualifying Meet in
Bethany, West Virginia were
quickly put to rest after a fourth
place finish in the five-team
event. It was, needless to say, a
let down after a promising
regular season mark of eight
wins and five defeats. ‘‘We fail-
ed to put it together in the big
one,” was Coach Dick Miller’s

explanation.

The results from the meet, in
which Roanoke took the first-
place trophy from defending
champion Lynchburg, are as
follows: Roanoke (45); Lynch-
burg (55); Bridgewater (68);
W&L (76); Hampden-Sydney
(92). Angus McBryde was
W&L’s top runner, with an
eleventh place time of 28:24. He
was followed by John Kelafant
in twelfth (28:30) and Greg
Branan in sixteenth (28:44).

If there is any consolation to
be found, it is that the team is
losing only two members,
seniors Howard Herndon and
Charlie Warner, who in the opi-
nion of Coach Miller did ‘‘a good
job” as co-captains. Otherwise,
next year’s team should have a
solid base of sophomores and
juniors. Greg Branan, the lone
junior this year, has been ap-
pointed the captain for 1981.

Generals Lose To Scots;
Season Finale Saturday

by Dale Park

After leading 20-10 late in the
third quarter, the Washington
and Lee football team dropped
a 23-20 decision to Maryville
College last Saturday at
Maryville.

The loss reduced W&L’s
season record to 5-4 and closed
out their ODAC mark at 2-3.

The Generals jumped out to a

14-10 halftime lead on an 80-

yard first-quarter scoring drive
and a 37-yard second-quarter
scoring drive. Senior fullback
Lee Minetree scored the first
touchdown by recovering a

fumble in the endzone, while .

junior quarterback Rich
Hachenburg threw a six-yard
pass to sophomore tailback
Chris Cavalline for the second
score.

“In the first half we moved
the ball effectively and ex-
ecuted our plays well,” said
head coach Gary Fallon.
“Defensively we were playing a
sound game, with guys like Ken
Mangeniello (sophomore defen-
sive end), John McKee (junior
linebacker) and Tommy Noble
(junior defensive end) giving
super performances.”’

Five minutes into the second
half, W&L stretched its lead to
20-10 as Hachenburg scampered
22 yards for a touchdown. The

Feature:

score was set up by Noble, who
intercepted a pass and returned
it to the Maryville 25-yard line.

Maryville rallied in the se-
cond half behind reserve
quarterback Bobby Boda.
Fallon commented: ‘‘Maryville
ran a lot of play-action in the se-
cond half. We had to take away
their running game, which is
the main part of their offense.
While our linebackers were
frozen watching the backs, their
receivers ran curl patterns
underneath our linebackers and
came up with some super recep-
tions.”’

W&L held ODAC rushing
leader Kevin Skipper to 39
yards, well below his season
average of 122 per game.

But while the Generals con-
tained Maryville’s running at-
tack, Boda sparked his team’s
comeback through the air,
throwing two second half
touchdown passes, the second
one a thirteen-yard deflection
with only 50 seconds left in the
game.

Boda completed 7 of 16 for 112
yards and two _ touchdowns,
while Hachenburg passed for
his third straight 100 yard-plus
performance for W&L, hitting
on 12 of 28 attempts for 136
yards and one touchdown.

Mistakes plagued a W&L of-
fense that had an otherwise im-
pressive afternoon of 308 total
yards.

After W&L’s final scoring
drive the Generals had posses-
sion of the ball seven more
times. Of these possessions
W&L punted three times, had
one pass intercepted, and lost
the ball three times through
fumbles.

“On the day,” stated Fallon,
“we turned the ball over eight
times. In previous games we’d
turn the ball over maybe two
times, but eight times caught up
with us. Not only did we put
more pressure on our defense
by having them on the field
more frequently, but we
couldn’t get the first downs in
order to eat up the clock.”

Next week the Generals play
their final game of the season
against the Hoyas of
Georgetown at Georgetown.
Fallon expects ‘‘a tight ball
game — they have a 4-3 record
and are looking for a winning
season, while we have a 5-4
record and are looking for our
first winning record in a while.
There is a lot of motivation for
us but we’ll have to make our
own breaks and take advantage
of any key situations.”

Rugby Gains Prominence

by Phil Murray

One of the best kept secrets on
campus is the existence of the
rugby club — and for good
reason.

For years the club has
languished on the verge of col-
lapse and has been sustained
only by a vague memory of a
national rugby championship
sometime in the late 60’s or ear-
ly 70’s (no one seems to
remember exactly when).

But this year a different at-
mosphere surrounds the club,
and after a few early troun-
cings, the club is beginning to
gain unity.

President Alex Richards
gives all of the credit for this
time around to one man, an-
thropology professor Larry
Babits, who has become the
first coach of the rugby club in
many years.

After coaching at North
Carolina State and taking part

in coaching seniors in England,
Babits has given the W&L club
new life. “If it wasn’t for him,”’
says Richards, “I don’t think
we’d have much of a team.”’

Indeed, it appears that Babits
has made great strides in
transforming this group con-
sisting of mostly freshmen and
sophomores into a competitive
rugby team. The first game of

the season was a disaster, los-
ing to a combination of the Va.
Tech B and C squads by a score
of 30 or 40 to 0 (no one
remembered the exact score,
not that it really mattered).

This past Sunday, however,
the club played a combination
of Tech’s A and B squads and
lost only 30-21. Earlier, the
Generals lost by a mere one
point to Hampden-Sydney.

The increasing skill of the
team is even more amazing,
considering that only three peo-
ple on this fall’s squad played
rugby for W&L last year and the
bulk of the team has played lit-
tle or no previous rugby.

Richards mentioned several
new players who have played
well and had especially kind
words for freshman standout
Herb Funsten.

Funsten, a placekicker in
high school, was 4-4 Sunday
against Va. Tech with three
conversions, a field goal, and a

“try” — the equivalent of a
touchdown.

Another tribute to Babits’
coaching abilities is the im-
pressive spring schedule he has
lined up, which includes a five-
match tour in North Carolina.

Should you wish to witness
this phenomena or simply have
nothing to do with your Sunday
afternoon, here are a few things
to look for.

The game is scored very
simply, four points for a try
(grounding the ball in your op-
ponent’s ‘‘in goal” area), two
points for a conversion after a
try, and three points for a field
goal which usually occurs on a
penalty kick.

You might also see a few
scrums, rucks, and mauls, uni-
que rugby methods of re-
starting the action. But perhaps
the most interesting rugby
tradition is that after the game,
both teams will gather around a
keg and forget their
animosities. After all, rugby is
a sport played by gentlemen.

Finish At 9-4

 

Booters Stun Navy, 1-0

by Mark Schramm

“To be honest with you,” a
reporter said to midfielder Ben
Muskin, “I didn’t think you
guys could do it.’’ Muskin smil-
ed and said, ‘‘You know, I
wasn’t too sure myself...but we
did it.” The “IT’’ was a stun-
ning, season-ending 1-0 victory
over Navy that gave the soccer
team a 9-4 record.

Both teams were fired up, and
there was up-and-down action
from the first whistle. ‘‘We had
nothing to lose,’’ said Coach
Rolf Piranian, ‘“‘we were the
underdogs, so we decided to
come out swinging.”’

The Generals pressed the
Midshipmen, who were coming
off a victory over No. 6 ranked
Old Dominion University, back
in their own zone, and winger
Brad Poorman launched a pair
of good shots that were turned
aside by the Navy keeper.

In the middle of the first half,
Navy came back and returned
the pressure. Goalie Kevin
Carney took charge, making
several incredible saves,
punching out corner kicks, and
directing traffic.

“Kevin played the greatest
game of his career,” Piranian
commented later. ‘‘He’s been
outstanding for a long time, but
today he outdid himself.”
Carney closed out his career
with a record 407 saves.

Another senior who finished a
brilliant career was Co-Captain
Bryan Williams, who played
despite a badly injured knee
that has hampered him
throughout the season.

The deadlock was finally
broken in the second half as
Brad Poorman scored at the
60:00 mark on a shot from 30
yards out.

“Ben Muskin got the ball to
me and I went wide on the
defender,” the high-scoring
sophomore said, ‘and the
goalie came out too far. I just
put the shot over his head and it
went in the corner.”’ The goal
was Poorman’s sixth and that,
combined with six assists, gave
him the team scoring title with
18 points.

Navy fought back gamely
after the goal and brought abo about

 

 

what one W&L player described
as the “longest 30 minutes of
(his) life.’’ However, the
Generals refused to yield.
Goalie Kirk Mancer preserved
the team’s seventh shutout with

some find saves, and the
defense on the whole turned in

another solid performance.

ly 7 goals each all year, and

and Tad Renner were picked as
captains for next year...All-Star
teams will be announced in a
week, and the Generals should
be well represented, with

Roland Simon dribbles past defender as Ben Muskin looks on.

At the final whistle a melee
ensued within the Generals’
team. They ran around the field
tackling each other and the
coaches as well. ‘You don’t ex-
perience that feeling too often,”’
Coach Piranian said later.
“That was the biggest thrill of
my career.”’

Piranian fulfilled his promise
to shave off his mustache if they
won, as did the assistant coach.
Ben Muskin, however, was able
to save his beard from the
razor, much to the chagrin of
his teammates.

“What a great way to end the
season,’’ Muskin said later.
“We really put it together. And
just think,’ he added with a
smile, ‘“‘we’ve got almost the
whole team coming back next
year.”’

Star Harrier

by John Harrison

Although several individuals
have contributed to the re-
juvenation of this year’s W&L
cross country team, there is lit-
tle doubt about who has given
the Generals the most consis-
tent and noteworthy perfor-
mances in every meet: Angus
McBryde. If you had to single
out one person who helped W&L
gain respectability in the
ODAC, the Charlotte, N.C.,
freshman harrier comes to
mind.

A review of his regular-
season statistics indicates why
he is so highly regarded. He was
W&L’s top runner in four of the
Generals’ six meets and finish-
ed in the first two spots in the
overall competition in three of
them. Perhaps even more im-
pressive are the facts that he
never finished lower than fifth
in any meet and that his slowest
time was better-than-averase

29:01.

McBryde has been a long
distance runner for many

years, so it is interesting to see
how he got started. As Angus
explains: ‘‘My father has
always been into running, but
that’s only part of it. In the
tenth grade a lot of my friends
were going out for spring
sports. I decided I’d get involv-
ed too, and partly because my
father was a long distance run-
ner I went out for cross country.
I’ve stuck with it ever since.”’

He is quite aware that the
leadership of senior co-captains
Charlie Warner and Howard
Herndon has contributed to the
improvement of the team.
“They aren’t the best runners
on the team, but they do a good

tices and making sure that the

have to remember also that it’s
an extra academic burden for
them, as seniors, to continue

McKee Typical Of

Generals’ Success

by Ed Gonsalves

John McKee regrets that he
has only four years to play foot-
ball for Washington and Lee
University.

The junior from Clarksdale,
Miss., missed out on seven
games during his sophomore
year when he broke his jaw dur-
ing practice following the third
game. As an intense athlete,
he’d like to stick around and
make up for the missed playing
time.

things again,’ McKee reports
concerning his return after the
injury. “It was _ frustrating
when I couldn’t play, but the
coaches were understanding
and still accepted me as a team
member. They positively
believed I would play again.”’
He’d also like to enjoy more of
the Generals’ new-found suc-
cess. Now in the third season
under head coach Gary Fallon,
WA&L is chasing its first winning
fall since 1967, having compiled

EC Mourns Amendment Failures, Seeks Alternatives

the EC and not the student
body. ‘According to many peo-
ple, the EC should have
jurisdiction over the amend-
ments,”’ said Baumgartner.

Willis then stated that the
amendments were actually a
student body composition, and
therefore should be approved or
rejected by the student body.

After discussing why the
amendments failed, Vines pro-
posed an alternate solution to
officially act on the amend-
ments. Under a proposal by
Vines, which will be officially
presented next week’s meeting,
an amendment can be passed if
two-thirds of those students
voting vote in favor of the
amendment.

According to Willis, this is one
of the two possibilities the EC
has. The other solution, said
Willis, is to present fewer
amendments to the student
body. Willis said that the EC
will discuss these possibilities
next week.

In a report to the EC, Senior
Representative Marshall Clark
announced that letters concern-
ing the recent violent acts in-
volving W&L students had been
delivered to Lexington Mayor
Charles Phillips, City Council
member James Imeson and
W&L President Robert E.R.
Huntley. Clark also stated that
members of both the EC and the
IFC met Tuesday with Lex-
ington Police Chief James A.

Kirby.

Clark said he was surprised
that the City Council acted so
quickly on the letter, discussing
its contents at last week’s Coun-
cil meeting. The Council shares
our concern,” said Clark, ‘‘and
I’m positive that they want to
establish some sort of policy.”’

Willis mentioned that
students will only get better
protection if they do two things:
(1) press charges with the
police and (2) give specific
facts. Willis claimed that some
changes might actually be tak-
ing place.

“On Friday night, some
policemen staked out the area
behind the Centel building,
waiting for townies,” said

hiring. Levine said he did not
see much room for that because
Carter’s freeze last May could
make another freeze ineffec-
tive.

A reduction in government
regulations has also been
discussed among Reagan
assistants, but Levine said, ‘‘I
have doubts whether that will
be achieved.’’ He explained that
behind every agency lies some
constituency that placed it
there and when deregulation oc-
curs, these groups tend to rise
in protest. Efforts to deregulate
agencies often meet failure due
to heavy lobbying, Levine said.

Levine added that ‘‘the time it
takes for any sound economic
policy to run its course and
achieve its ends is longer than
the political cycle will allow.”’
His solution was to have stag-
gered six-year terms for Con-
gressmen and allow the Presi-
dent only one term lasting six or
seven years.

Levine described the U.S.
drop in productivity as a ‘‘fun-
damental problem.” He said
the main reason for this drop
was that the tax structure in
this country does not encourage
companies to invest the
necessary money in_ the
technology which is vital to pro-
ductivity.

He also said that Reagan
economic advisers fear that
soaring interest rates may
make a _ recession recovery
“short-lived.”

Speaking on the Presidential
election, Levine said he saw
“‘last Tuesday as less of an elec-
tion than a rejection of Presi-
dent Carter.”’

He attributed Carter’s loss to
several factors. Levine said
that the resurgence of the
hostage issue and_ tbe
Ayatollah’s fear of a Reagan
victory worked unfavorably
against Carter.

Jody Powell and Ham Jordan,
two men of limited experience
and no qualifications for their
roles, worked against the Presi-
dent, Levine said.

Levine also noted that Carter
appeared ‘‘cold’’ in the debate
and had _  ‘‘computer-like
responses,” while Reagan did
not come across as the war-
hawk Carter accused him of be-
ing, Carter’s referral to his
daughter, Amy, put him in a
position of ridicule which cer-
tainly did not help him, Levine
said.

Fearing he had painted the
economic outlook of America
too gloomy, Levine ended his
speech by quoting Supreme
Court Justice William 0.
Douglas: ‘I think the heart of
America is sound. I think the
conscience of America is
bright. I think the future of
America is great.’’ With that,
Mr. Levine received warm ap-
plause from the audience.

Willis. ‘‘I also heard that there
was a complaint at one (frater-
nity) house, and there was im-
mediate response by — the
police.”’

a 5-4 record with one game re-
maining. McKee thinks 1980 is
just the beginning to a string of
successful years.

“The attitude has improved
tremendously since I was a
freshman,”’ the 6-0, 200-lb. star-
ting linebacker relates. ‘‘Coach
Fallon put himself to the task
when he came here. He made us
work twice as hard as the teams
we play, and his program has
definitely changed the outlook
for the team.

A two-year letterman, McKee
is but one of the talented
players making a name for
himself and W&L. As a
freshman, he finished fifth on
the team in tackles. This fall, he
stands first after nine games.

His teammates elected John
one of three captains for 1980
along with Chris Leiser and Lee
Minetree. The threesome has
led a squad which is turning the
W&L program around.

Generals’ success, which has

marks, respectively, in 1979 and

example, has been playing

An engineering major,
McKee sees football in the same
light as his studies. ““You have
to work at both to attain high
levels of achievement. One
must prepare for a_ football

game the same way one
prepares for a test — by study-
ing.”

For McKee and his 1980
Generals’ teammates, the stu-
dying is paying off.

ing. He is a very relaxed,

he quickly adjusted from the
three-mile distance in high
school to the five miles in col-
lege.”

Miller relishes the prospect of
coaching a runner of such a
high calibre for three more
years, and W&L fans will be
seeing a lot of McBryde

Sex Roles Discussed In Joint

by Ralph Frasea

“IT was curious to find out
what W&L guys thought about
sex roles,’ said a female par-
ticipant of an inter-sex discus-
sion held at Skylark last Satur-
day through a cooperative ef-
fort by Randolph-Macon
Women’s College and W&L.

The seminar was jointly con-
ducted by RWMC psychologist
Dr. Sam Namenek and W&L’s
Dr. Jim Worth with the inten-
tion of bringing several
Students from each_ school
together to exchange ideas on
gender roles in a changing
society, the interests and
desires of both sexes, and the
problems of dating at single-sex
schools. ‘‘We talked about
everything from abortion to
pre-marital sex, the logistics of
, women in jobs to ERA,”’ said
one W&L freshman participant.

This writer was one of the 12
W&L representatives in the pro-
gram. The contingent included
fraternity members as well as
independents encompassing all
four years. There was but one
dominant factor amongst the
men: to seek alternatives to the
typical grab-a-beer, stand-
around, engage-in-small-talk
syndrome which seems to
predominate social life in all the
area unisex schools. A
sophomore stated, ‘‘I’ve grown
tired of the usual routine here at
W&L. With the isolation of the
schools, it’s difficult to establish
a serious, honest relationship
with a woman.”

Upon congregating at
Skylark, a palatial estate nestl-
ed in the George Washington
National Forest, the par-
ticipants engaged in a name
game which necessitated that
each person create an alliter-

native adjective to accompany
their first name. Such colorful
monickers as “‘Barbaric Bill,”’
“Typical Tom,” ‘‘Crazy Kim’,
and Tenacious Todd abounded.
A surprisingly effective way of
remembering names, everyone
was well acquainted with each
other in a short period of time.

After a collective statement
of the day’s goals, all embarked
on a “‘trust walk,” in which an
individual was blindfolded and
led throughout the extensive
Skylark property by a partner,
who gives the sightless one ob-
jects to identify through the use
of the four remaining senses.

After lunch, the participants
roamed the area for an obiect
which personified their femini-
ty or masculinity. Junior Tom
Southall selected a piece of bark
in this abstract task. Capturing
the sentiments of the entire
group, Southall explained that it
symbolized the protective
facade or mask worn by people
at such situations as parties,
where one may refrain from
openness and honesty to avoid
being hurt.

The group went on to discuss
the hindrances which prevent
good male-female _relation-
ships. The primary indictments
were a limited access to the op-
posite sex caused by the isola-
tion of single-sex schools, and
the lack of openness between
the sexes.

“IT feel that unisex schools
have a special responsibility to
provide a wide variety of means
to meet the opposite sex, as well
as to promote a sharing of feel-
ings and attitudes between the
sexes,’’ Dr. Worth said.

Having mentioned some

group discussions, five to a
group. Many described it as the
most interesting aspect of the
program. “I’ve always wanted
to just sit down with a woman
and talk about the whole male-
female process. I wanted to
know what went through their
minds about men in general,
and if they thought the wall
standing between honest and
open communication between
the sexes could be torn down. It
was fascinating to engage in a
frank, no-holds-barred discus-
sion about things that are im-
portant to all of us,”’ one partici-
pant expounded.

“IT felt that a sense of op-
timism pervaded,”’ Dr. Worth
said. ‘“‘Some of the cynicism due
to the lack of communication
was eradicated, and it seemed
that all felt there was hope for
this real and pressing pro-
blem.” —

A Randolph-Macon senior felt
similarly. ‘Now I know that
men are just as nervous and
protective as I am in party

situations. If I’m bored at a frat
party from now on I can call up
any of 12 wonderful men and
say, ‘Hey, I’m heie at W&L.
Let’s get a cup of coffee or
something.’ ”’

All participants readily
agreed that much had been ac-
complished. The ‘high anxie-
ty’’ situations which usually ex-
ist at parties were discussed,
with everyone agreeing that be-
ing more open with one another
is a necessity. A real insight in-
to the ideas of the opposite sex
was attained, and a satisfied
sense of mutual understanding
were achieved through discus-
sion.

Dr. Worth, whose sentiments
were heartily echoed by all,
stated, ‘‘I hope the respective
administrations will allow us to
hold more of these, and I hope
more people become interested
and sign up for these meetings.
I would like to start a program

There does, indeed, seem to
be a movement for increasing
honesty between the sexes and
for alternatives to the party
syndrome. Randolph-Macon

Patterson has several projects
under way at her school. Closer
to home, the Outing Club, led by
Bob Forsyth, provides an alter-
native way to have fun and
meet women in an unpressured
situation. Also, a group called
OMSA (Organization of Men for .
Social Alternatives) is gaining
support while in_ its
developmental stages, as well
as future discussions planned
by Dr. Worth. Interested per-
sons should see him.

Clearly, there are alter-
natives to the stagnant and con-
stricting social life here. All are
encouraged to take advantage
of them.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Let It Stand

In a few short days the Interfraternity Council’s
decision in the Pi Kappa Phi ‘‘hazing”’ case will be
reviewed by the Student Affairs Committee. For
those of you who do not know the discipline system at
Washington and Lee and as a reminder to those of you
who are familiar with the system, all IFC decisions
are reviewed by the SAC. What this whole adjudica-

tion and review process boils down to is a safety valve —

for the faculty and administration on fraternity self-
government.

While we think it is unfair-for the SAC to review all
IFC decisions, we-think the SAC will be doing a grave
injustice to the fraternity system if the IFC decision.

in the Pi Kappa Phi case is changed. The IFC has im-
proved itself vastly in the past few years. Its decisions
are more reasonable, and in this case the IFC is in the
best position to make a ruling. Fraternity members |
should be able to elect a disciplinary body which does
not have to look over its shoulder to see what the
faculty and administration think of its decsions. In
short, a viable ruling has been handed down. Some
people will say the fraternity should be punished
more harshly while others will say the fraternity
should not be punished at all. But the important thing
to remember is that the IFC has to make the decision»
and that decision should be up held.

One Bad Apple...

There is no reason that one bad apple should spoil
the whole barrel. The Pi Kappa Phi fraternity pledges
set out to have a little fun and got carried away. We

think the fraternity system should not be judged by .
the mistake of one fraternity. And to add a footnote,

we hope that faculty members will not throw their
arms up in dispair because of this mistake or the
IFC’s decision. We can not help but think back to the
boxwoods incident last year and some vocal outpour-
ings from the faculty. At least one of those faculty
members is quiet now...

Of all the tasks a reporter must per-

ceedings presents the greatest
challenge. Because of their somber
nature, the reporter must make all
eforts to present the facts in a most
neutral and honest way.

Tuesday night’s IFC hearing involv-
ing a local fraternity and a member of
its national organization presented such
a problem. To begin with, there is the in-
ate temptation to bring a comic light in-
to the proceedings. Unfortunately,
nothing could be further from a
reporter’s professional obligation.

Secondly, one must be careful to pre-
sent both sides of the case, and present
them neutrally. In Tuesday night’s
discussion, the Phi found itself in the
situation of reporting news essentially
derogatory to Washington and Lee.

In this instance, we feel that it is our

feelings that we have about this case are

Phi Accussed Of Republican Slant

Dear Sirs: -

If one can make broad

' generalizations: about the at-

titudes of a given school, one of
the first to be made about W&L

js that this is a conservative in-

stitution, with a large student
contingient Supporting the
Republican Party. This is well
evidenced by the strength of
W&L’s Young Republicans, if

not also by the general state of .

jubilation on campus over
Reagan’s victory last Tuesday.

Why, then, does the Ring-tum

Phi feel obligated to appease its
Republican readership by prin-

- ting. biased reporting in a
- slanted format — reflecting
popular opinion at the cost of

objective journalism?

Last week’s front page bore
the headline: ‘‘Senators Defend
Party Platforms.” What follow-
ed, in fact, was a 469-word arti-
cle on. Republican Senator
Schweiker’s boosting his par-
ty’s platform. There was no
mention in the article of either
another senator or another plat-
form. Instead, coverage of
Democratic Senator Steven-
son’s speech was printed on
page two in an article of scarce-
ly 200 words. Moreover, the
story’s introductory paragraph
makes a subjective assumption
with no attempt at all to
disguise the ‘‘reporter’s biases:
“The Senator obviously thinks

candidates should be forgotten
also as he slipped and mention-
ed ‘President Reagan’ ”’’.

Spectator And The Year 2002

The year is 2002, and many amazing events are
going on at Washington and Lee. Would you
believe that the school is bisexual now? Yes, girls
actually stroll the stately campus; you can hear
the oohs and ahs as they drool over the macho col-
umns. An etheral bliss and an aura of productivity
pervade the quiet little campus that hovered at the
brink of sterility back in the gay 1980’s. But as the
Dean of Human Relationships has pointed out, the
students have been a little too productive.

We are in the process of an extraordinary baby
boom. There is severe overcrowding in the dorms.
We’ve had to double-up some of the accommoda-
tions, but this has resulted in some more serious
problems — notably those Greek-styled. affairs
that take place on the floors. We’re plum out of
matresses and king-sized pillows.

Perhaps, then, you’ll understand and sym-
pathize with the administration’s plan to move the
campus out of Lexington and off this planet. We
were all dismayed a number of years ago when the

School of Economics was converted into a nursery
(the only building with a shower for the baptismal
ceremonies), but more recent and disastrous
events really point up the need for a change. My
God, there are weeds growing through the hill’s
brick shuttle pad and grass is growing in faculty
window boxes! As the President, Ms. P.P. Pearl,
has stated, ‘‘Venus has a lovely and provocative
atmosphere.”’ Here is an excerpt from her speech
to the Board of Erectors.

The time has come for a change. We have wad-
dled in tradition for too long. I propose a new cam-
pus to be located in the valley of Eros on the planet
Venus. We need new and modern facilities; we
need a stimulator in every room. Besides the vene-
tian climate requires no clothes; we could get rid
of these damned preppy codpieces and be truly
liberated.

Needless to say, the Board of Erectors accepted
the President’s suggestions. The new Washington

and Lee opens next week in the valley Eros. Stay
tuned.

to get off to a ‘‘productive and
enthusiastic start’? on one’s
“‘schoolwork.’’ The semester
can be enjoyed socially as well,
if one’s “priorities are in
order.’’ As have no doubt notic-
ed, I’m writing this entire letter
in English to challenge your
mind immediately to better
prepare you for your ‘‘lessons.”’
I would appreciate from time to
time an “itemized accounting”’
in ‘“‘general categories” of your
expenditures. I won’t mind in-
cluding a couple of extra quid

for a ‘‘prom”’ or special occa-
sion. Although you were rather
vague as to what this “High
Table” nonsense is — I will
trust you to use your good judg-
ment that you not get involved
in some ‘“‘drug’’ or “‘religious
cult.”

I’m only mentioning these
things to jog your conscience a
bit so that your experience will
be fruitful as well as fun — will
follow up in a few days with a
little less serious note.

Love,

The University cannot effec-
tively guarantee students or
others at Washington and Lee
that they will be insulated
against the increasing  in-
cidence of violence in society.

The University is reviewing
and will continue to review mat-

ters of campus security of per- .

sons and property. This review

will include matters such as .

campus lighting, building
patrols by watchmen, and the
number and role of persons who
are employed for security pur-
poses.

ame

The University will continue

to work closely

and |

cooperatively with city officials |
toattempt preventive measures *

and to apprehend offenders. In

this connection, it is vitally im- |

portant for students and others
who are exposed to acts of
violence or threats of violence,
or who witness such acts, to
report their experience to city
or University officials and to
assist in assuring apprehension
of offenders.

I encourage appropriate
representatives of your Com-
mittee to continue discussions
with Dean John and other
University officials to the end of
assisting in providing an effec-
tive response to the problems.

Sincerely,

Robert E.R. Huntley

Regulations Put Limit On Student Earnings

(continued from page 1)
first time, Towler may be
without the dining hall income.
“That’s just a rag,” said
Towler. ‘‘Here’s someone try-
ing to be ambitious and they try
to keep him from it.”

Jerry Broccoli, student ser-
vices manager at the dining
hall, is in the same situation.
‘They told me I couldn’t work
in the dining hall on my own (in
addition to a work-study job).
That’s stopping me from work-
ing extra and making ends
meet. The senior midfielder on
W&L’s lacrosse team added
that he did not know what will
happen to him when he reaches
the $1,000 earnings limit dic-
tated by the federal regulations.

Bartini, director of financial
aid since the summer of 1979,
said that the earnings limit is
not a new regulation. Previous-
ly, students holding work-study
jobs at W&L were not pro-
hibited from working other
campus jobs such as the dining
hall or the university switch-
board. Bartini said, ‘‘In the
eyes of the federal government,
a student on financial aid is
earning money in excess of his
need when he takes on an addi-
tional job. And since much of
the financial aid a_ student
receives is federal money, the
government feels it can
regulate the other monies a stu-
dent takes in. ‘‘The regulation

makes sense from the govern-

ment’s point of view,” he said,
adding that ‘enforcing these
regulations doesn’t mean that I
agree with them. Please
understand that I’m not doing it
to be a bad guy...It’s my job,
right or wrong.”

The regulation is not new, but
it is just now being im-
plemented at W&L because of
an increase in violations and a
corresponding increase in
crack-downs on violators. He
said, ‘‘I don’t think there were
as many violations (nationally)
in recent years,” he observed,
“Now the government has
started taking a stronger look.”’
Violators sometimes receive
penalties Bartini would like to
avoid: “If federal auditors find
that regulations aren’t being en-
forced, they have the authority
to take away federal funds. $500
from one student wouldn’t be
disastrous,’’ he said, but added
that getting caught has meant
‘the loss of all federal financial
aid to a university for a year or
so in some cases.”’

Students may be able to earn
extra money, but not at W&L.
‘“There’s a catch,’’ Bartini con-
ceded, ‘‘I have no control over
funds received outside the
university...(and) how will I
ever know about (jobs in Lex-
ington or during vacations)?”’
But he said he realizes that
there is a problem with the

availability of jobs for students
in Lexington, unlike the
metropolitan area where he at-
tended college and worked both
on and off campus.

An increase in the amount of
funds a student must provide in-
creases each year regardless of
his BEOG, parents’ contribu-
tion, loan or a variety of other
sources. Included in one’s finan-
cial aid package is the stipula-
tion that a student is expected to
contribute a certain amount
from his own resources each
year. This amount is usually
$500 freshman year, $600 for
sophomores, $700 for juniors
and $700 from seniors. An addi-
tional increase, both in time and
money comes after a student’s
first year in college. That year,
freshmen work five hours a
week and earn approximately
$500 that year on a work-study
job. But after that, students on
work-study are expected to
work 10 hours each week.

Bartini said that such is the
policy at W&L, unlike some
other schools, because the
university does not want a
freshman to have too many

time constraints in his first year

here. Still, that means that once
a student becomes a
sophomore, he must work an
additional five hours per week.
The $500 increase in work-study
money means that a student
loses $500 in grant money. So
while he continues to receive
that $500 (but in a different
form), he has an additional
time constraint of five hours
each week placed on him.

Sometimes as a student takes
on responsibilities to help con-
tribute to his expenses, he finds
little time for his work. Chip
Nunley is an assistant head
dorm counselor thie year. Also,
he has a work-study job in the
placement office. These posi-
tions provide him with a free
room in Graham-Lees dor-
mitory, two meals each day in
the dining hall and approx-
imately $1,000 per year. Nunley
also plays football and has serv-
ed on the Interfraternity Coun-
cil. His freshmen year, he did
not have a work-study job.
When he began one his
sophomore year it meant 10 less
hours of free time.

The next year he became a
dorm counselor, another drain

on his free time. This year, he is
an assistant head, meaning
even more responsibility. After
classes, his job, football prac-
tice and supper, it’s back to the
dorm in the evening. Once
there, he may have additional
duties as dorm _ counselor.
“There’s hardly any time for
work,’’ he lamented.

Nunley said he had been
under the impression that his
grant might be increased if his
grades were high. He has main-
tained a 3.3 average, but his
grant has gone down about $300
although the total package has
remained the same.

According to Bartini, the
BEOG determination is out of
his hands. “I don’t do anything
to determine that,’’ he said. A
student’s package is determin-
ed first of all by the federal
government, which decides how
much of a BEOG will be award-
ed. Then the work-study job’s
value and a National Direct Stu-
dent Loan (now about $1,200)
are added to the package. The
remainder is made up by
various grants, including
University grants, Bartini ex-
plained.

Millhiser Elected To
Board Of Trustees —

Ross R. Millhiser, vice chair-
man of the board of Philip Mor-
ris Inc. of New York was
lected to a six-year term on
Washington & Lee University’s
yoard of trustees Saturday.
(Nov. 1)

Millhiser, who rose in the
ranks of Philip Morris from
yperating a cigarette-making
nachine in his native Rich-
nond -39 years ago, has long
een active in the support of
ligher education, particularly
n Virginia.

He will officially take office at
he winter meeting of the W&L
yoard in February, together
vith the Rt. Rev. Christopher
<eller Jr., Episcopal bishop of
he diocese of Arkansas, whose
lection as a board member
ook place earlier.

After an initial six-year term
in the board, each will be eligi-
le for election to one additional

ix-year term.

Millhiser became Philip Mor-
is Ine. vice chairman in 1978
fter five years as president of
he diversified company, which
ow has six divisions that had
evenues exceeding $8 billion
ist year. When he was elected
) that office, the corporation
ad five divisions, including the
ien-recently acquired Miller
‘rewing Co., which subsequent-
, rose from the nation’s
eventh-largest brewing com-
any to second. During
lillhiser’s presidency Philip
forris Inc. also acquired The
even-Up Co.; the third-largest

oft-drink producer.

He joined Philip Morris in
41, the year he received his
.A. degree from Yale Univer-
ty. After Army services in
urope during World War II, he
turned to its Richmond unit
ad acquired further operating
perience.

Subsequently he was moved

the company’s parent offices

in New York, working at first in
print-media advertising. In 1954
he became brand manager for
Marlboro cigarettes, now the
best-selling cigarette brand in
world.

In 1927 he became assistant
marketing director for the
parent corporation and a year
later was elected vice presi-
dent. In 1959 he became assis-
tant chief of operations and a
year after that became director
of marketing. In 1963 he was
elected to Philip Morris Inc.’s
board, and in 1964 became ex-
ecutive vice president in charge
of marketing.

In addition to its cigarette,
beer and soft-drink production,
Philip Morris Inc. has diver-
sified into the manufacture of.
specialty paper, packaging
materials and chemicals as

well as into community
development and home-
building.

Millhiser is a trustee and

fraternity, Beta Gamma
Sigma, in 1977.

He is also chairman of the ex-
ecutive committee of The
Tobacco’ Institute’ in
Washington, D.C.

In 1978 Millhiser was the
keynote speaker representing
the nation’s business and in-
dustry at Washington & Lee’s

Requirements Eased By

Alternative Proposals

by W. Cope Moyers

In an effort to ease re-
quirements for amending the
student body constitution, the
Executive Committee Monday
night passed a motion revising
amendment procedures.

By an 8-4 vote, the committee
agreed to change current re-
quirements making passage of
any constitutional amendment
possible only when half the stu-
dent body votes. The new revi-
sion, should it be approved next
semester, would reduce the re-
quirement from 50 percent to 20
percent.

The changes, suggested by
Treasurer Willie Mackie, would
increase the number of votes
needed to approve an amend-
ment from 66 percent to three-
quarters. Voting would still
take place for three days but on-
ly two polling places would be
used.

The‘ committee’s action

followed last week’s rejection of .

eleven amendments that would
have, according to President
Bob Willis, made necessary
changes in the student body
constitution. Although all

Student Injured

by John Ran Smith
Several confrontations bet-
ween W&L students and local
youths occurred last weekend,
including one incident in which
a student was injured and
received medical treatment.

Five members of the Pi Kap-
pa Phi fraternity were return-
ing from the library to their
house around 1:30 Saturday
morning when they saw a group
of five youths .tearing down
clotheslines at the neighboring
Davidson Park Apartments, ac-
cording to Clyde Harkrader, the
president of Pi Phi.

The students went to stop the
locals from doing any more
damage, when they were

threatened by the youths said
Harkrader. Harkrader said he
then tried to get his friends to go
back to the fraternity house.

Harkrader received a biow to
the back of his head, which had
to be closed with stitches.

The police were called and ac-
cording to Harkrader, they said
that they knew the group.

Harkrader said one of the
youths has been identified, and
the students involved in the inci-
dent were going to identify the

other four juveniles on Wednes-
day.

Members of the Pi Kappa

Alpha house also had problems
with local youths Saturday mor-
ning.
According to Russell Stall,
the Social chairman at PiKA,
some high school-aged locals
entered their fraternity house
during a party.

“I think there were five high
school kids,” said Stall. ‘‘We
caught them stealing liquor bet-
ween 12:30 and 1:00 a.m.”’ Stall
said that PiKA is going to press
charges.

Blair Pritchett, a member of
Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity,
said that a receiver, pre-amp,
and amp valued at $600 were
stolen from his car. He
discovered the theft Saturday
morning.

There were no signs of forced
entry, he said. ‘It was as if they
had a key,”’ he continued. There
was also a wallet with cash in it
on the console, but it was not
taken.

Pritchett said the police
believe they knew who was
responsible for the theft, but the
items have not yet been
recovered.

eleven amendments were ap-
proved by students, only 22 per-
cent of them voted.

Earlier in the meeting, EC
member Jim Vines suggested
that there be no requirements
about the number of students
needed to vote in the amend-
ment procedure and instead
suggested that any amendment
be ratified if it is approved by
three-quarters of the students
who vote.

Vines’ motion also called for
three voting places instead of
two. The motion failed 7-5 with
Mackie, Bud White, Eric
Myers, Ben Hale and Marshall
Clark voting against. Two-
thirds.is necessary for the EC to
approve a motion.

Myers objected to both Vines’
and Mackie’s motions, saying
that it would be too easy to
amend the constitution.

“It should be difficult to
change any constitution, not
easy,’’ Myers said. ‘You are
going to have a small part of the
school making some potentially
important decisions.’’

But other members of the
committee pointed to the last
two attempts at amending the
constitution, both of which fail-
ed because not enough of the
student body voted.

‘“‘We must accept the fact that
students won’t vote,’ EC
member Jeff Edwards said.

The committee agreed to
delay the student vote on the
proposed amendment until Spr-
ing Term registration next
semester:

In other business, Clark
reported on his discussion with
Lexington Police Chief J.A. Kir-
by concerning security for the
university community. Clark
said Kirby had expressed his
desire to work with W&L in an
effort to reduce the number of
crimes against students. Clark
labled the meeting ‘‘very con-
structive.”

Edwards told the committee
of another incident of violence
at Davidson Park last weekend
between students and area
residents. He expressed his
dissatisfaction with the lack of
university security at the park,
which houses a number of
students.

The committee heard the
monthly report from the Con-
tact Committee. Chairman
Scott Cardoza reported that
Contact had spent $6,184 and
that G. Gordon Liddy, a one-
time defendant in the
Watergate trials, will speak at
the university on Monday,
December 8.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

An Apology...

We would like to apologize for an unclear sentence
in last week’s editorial. Although we were referring to
Dr. Merchant in the last sentence of ‘“‘One Bad Ap-
ple...”, some people took the sentence to mean a
recently departed member of the faculty. The
sentence meant Dr. Merchant and Dr. Merchant only.

One of the greatest American rights is the right to
be wrong. Journalists often breathe a sigh of relief
because of the First Amendment. Yet the right to be
wrong is one right the press relies on far too often, the
Ring-tum Phi included. While we do not think our
editorial was wrong, we realize there is no excuse for
leaving in a sentence which is unclear or misleading.
We promise to exercise our right to be wrong more

cautiously in the future.

Letter To The Editor

 

Junior Criticizes Ring-tum Phi

Gentlemen:

After having had the opportunity to read your
newspaper for three months I feel compelled to
comment upon it. As a product comprised of news
reporting, opinion writing, editing, layout, and
printing, the Ring-tum Phi without question fails
in all categories and in so doing misrepresents and
disgraces the university it serves. The issues are
consistently poor; further comment on the ill-
conceived and miserably written smut occasional-
ly appearing in the ‘Spectator’ column, which,
along with your questionable decision to print it,
has been attacked by others both in your pages
and privately sufficiently to encourage me to
believe that a not insignificant number of others in
the university community share a real concern for
the Ring-tum Phi. I will confine myself to a few
observations on the most recent issue (Nov. 13).

Your brief editorial declaration of your obliga-
tions as a newspaper is instructive, especially
when read together with the letter concerning

- your reportorial biases submitted by Robert M.

Ferguson, whose point is well taken and cannot be
overemphasized. Perhaps the key to understand-
ing the apparent contradiction between your state-
ment regarding objective reporting (and your
questionable claim to legitimacy based on this
“‘principle’’) and the treatment of the news article
to which Mr. Ferguson’s letter refers lies in the

- words “In this instance...” The implication is that

the editors of the Ring-tum Phi found themselves
with a news item so significant, so worthy of objec-
tive reporting, that they hastily drafted a limited
policy of ‘‘professional obligation,” applied it to
this news event (which so sparked the journalistic
fire presumably latent in the staff that not one but
three editorials, the total output for the week, in

LEXINGTON HARDWARE COMPANY

23 South Main Street

fact, were devoted to it), and were so proud of this
novel form of journalism that they felt the need to
use the editorial page to call it to public attention.
In other instances, one infers, you do not feel the
same duty to report ‘‘what actually happened.”

The most casual perusal of your newspaper
reveals myriad faults: Misspelled headlines
(“‘Alternitives’’ on page 1), headlines lacking
verbs (“Star Harrier’’), photographs without cap-
tions, abundant punctuation and spelling errors
throughout, and, perhaps the most maddening
feature of this particular issue, an article which
fails completely to address itself to the topic of its
headline. I refer to the headline on page 3: ‘‘Ante-
bellum Residence To Be Restored.” This article
further annoys by having no stated subject, begin-
ning and ending arbitrarily without ever having
made a point, and consisting almost entirely of ap-
parently quoted material whose sources are not
once identified.

Implicit in your function not only as the primary
means of news dissemination on this campus but
also as the University’s ambassador to the world
at large is an obligation to the University com-
munity to strive for excellence. Neither your
reportorial and editorial policies nor the careless
and inconsistent product which you produce ac-
curately reflects the tradition, attainments, and
ideals of Washington and Lee. I write this letter to
offer criticism which I deeply hope will encourage
you to re-examine your obligations and your craft
with an eye toward a publication which truly
serves and represents the Washington and Lee
community.

Sincerely,
Lawrence Norford

Generals End Season With Victory

by Dale Park

After an early defensive
breakdown, the Washington and
Lee varsity football team over-
powered the Georgetown Hoyas
in a season-ending 36-7 romp
last Saturday at Georgetown.

The Generals finished with a
6-4 season record, their first
winning mark since 1967.

Said head coach Gary Fallon:
“I’m very happy for my
players. We can finally touch
something substantial as proof
that our hard work has paid
off.”’ The last time the Generals
scored more points was in 1976,
when they defeated this same
Georgetown team, 43-12.

Not only did the W&L team
finish on a good note, but senior
slotback Chris Leiser ended his
impressive career with a 152-
yard, one touchdown perfor-
mance; the TD came on a 71-
yard touchdown dash early in
the fourth quarter.

“Chris will be tough to
replace,” commented Fallon.
“He did everything for us
—rushed, returned kickoffs and
punts, and he also set a good ex-
ample for the younger

players.”’
Things started off slowly for

_the Generals, as Georgetown
quarterback Tim Marotta
scrambled 70 yards on the first

   

play from scrimmage for a
touchdown, putting Georgetown
in front, 7-0.

“There was an initial mix-up
on defense on our part,”’ stated
Fallon. Against. Georgetown’s
‘“‘wishbone”’ offense, individual
assignments became more
complicated and no one picked
up the wingback on that first
play. But we straightened
things out right away.”’

The Generals’ defense did
straighten out, and for the next
59 minutes and 42 seconds the
Hoyas did not score again.

The Generals’ offense, how-
ever, had no trouble scoring.

Late in the first quarter W&L
nose-guard Mike Pressler tackl-
ed Marotta in the Hoya endzone
to cut the Georgetown lead to
7-2.

The Generals followed with
three touchdowns in the next
twenty minutes. All three tallies
came from sophomore tailback
Chris Cavalline, playing in his
first game in five weeks.

On the first score, junior
quarterback Rich Hachenburg
hit Cavalline with a 27-yard
touchdown pass. The run failed,
making the score 8-7, W&L.

Cavalline’s other touchdowns
came on runs of three and two
yards late in the second and
third quarters, respectively, as
the Generals rolled to a 23-7

TP isats 71 yard burst early in
the fourth quarter expanded the
W&L margin to 30-7, and sopho-
more tailback Ken Robinson’s
two-yard touchdown plunge
with 30 seconds left in the game

 

closed out the scoring.

Watergate “mastermind” G. Gordon Liddy

Y

O >

Liddy Speaks Monday

G. Gordon Liddy, a former
staff assistant to Richard Nixon
and the acknowledged master-
mind of the Watergate break-in,
will speak Monday night at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Liddy, whose conspicuous
silence set him apart from most
other Watergate defendants,
spent four-and-a-half years in
prison for his part in the break-
in and his refusal to cooperate
with investigators. In recent
months, Liddy has again caught
the public’s attention with his
new book, Will, in which he
discloses plots to kill fellow
White House plumber Howard
Hunt and columnist Jack
Anderson.

Liddy’s visit to Washington
and Lee is sponsored by Con-
tact, an organization directed
jointly by the Intrafraternity
Council and the W&L student

government. Liddy’s fee of
$3600 is considerably higher
than the usual $2500-3000 spent
to attract lecturers, but Liddy
brings with him some im-
pressive credentials.

According to former contact
member Bruce Poole, ‘Liddy
has been described by the
Washington Post as the most
sought after campus speaker of
his time. He should be an in-
teresting speaker.”’

So if you can tear yourself
away from studying for exams,
drop by Lee Chapel for what
promises ‘to be an interesting
lecture from the controversial
G. Gordon Liddy.

WLUR:

by Cope Moyers

Don’t let his title as assistant
professor of journalism and
general manager of Washington
and Lee’s radio station fool you.
Bob de Maria sometimes feels
like he’s managing a women’s
shoe store.

It is hard to find another radio
station quite like WLUR,
Washington and Lee University
Radio. With the exception of
two engineers, the entire staff is
comprised of students from the
university. Programming is
unique, offering the listener a
wide and varied range of news
and music, some popular and
some obscure. And the main
purpose of the station, accord-
ing to de Maria, is to train
future broadcasters and jour-
nalists.

Student

Sleuth

Recovers Goods

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent, performing a little detec-
tive work of his own, recovered
over $1500 worth of property
and helped Lexington police ar-
rest suspects in the incident.

Russell Rector, a junior,
claims that his house, located at
307 N. Main St., was broken into
twice during a five-day period
before Thanksgiving vacation.
Rector stated that he and his
roommate, Sam. Stroud, lost
over $1800 from the break-ins.

According to Rector, the first
break-in occured on Monday,
Nov. 10, at which time a stereo,
a box of cash, and a pair of
speakers, all totalling $1500,

were taken. Rector claims that
the second break-in occurred on

Friday, Nov. 14, at which time
he and Stroud lost a tapedeck,
an unknown amount of cash,
and a pellet gun, all worth over
$300.

Rector believes that both in-
cidents occured between 6:30
p.m. and 10 p.m., when he and
Stroud are normally out of the
house.

After the second break-in took
place, Rector said he went to a
location where he believed he
would find several people he
suspected to be involved in the
incidents. Rector claims he
found one of his missing
cassette tapes while at this loca-
tion, and he returned to his
house.

After waiting five minutes,
Rector said he returned to the
location, where he confronted a
youth who had since shown up.
Rector said the youth, who
claimed to be involved in three

“‘My job is so appealing be-
cause it’s fun watching students
grow into broadcasters while
having a good time,’’ de Maria
says. “It’s a growing ex-
perience.”’

Because the station serves as
both a public radio station and
journalism laboratory, mis-
takes that often occur don’t go
unnoticed by the public. Besides
dead air time associated with
students failing to make their
shifts and relatively minor
mistakes with pronunciation
and operating station equip-
ment, there are times when de
Maria feels his heart stop. He
recounts how one early morning
DJ played the actual emergen-
cy tape warning of an imminent
disaster instead of the test tape.

(See WLUR; page 9)

other robbery cases in another
state, promised to help Rector if
Rector promised not to inform
the police of his whereabouts.

Rector then claimed that the
youth appeared at Rector’s
house on Sunday, bringing with
him the missing stereo and a
tapedeck which apparently did
not belong to either Rector or
Stroud. Rector said his infor-
mant provided him with names
and information which led to
the recovery of $1500 of the
$1800 in missing goods.

Rector said his next move
was to call a friend, who had
also had some merchandise
stolen, and a member of the
Lexington police force. Rector
said he and the police officer
waited for the informant to
return, but instead, another
person appeared unexpectedly.

Rector said that the police,
once provided with names and
addresses of break-in suspects,
obtained search warrants. Rec-
tor said that the police have
since recovered over $3000 in

Judicial Board
Clarifies Penalty

Individuals Can Compete
In Intramurals

by Mike Perry

The Interfraternity Council
Judicial Board met Tuesday
night to clarify the punishment
it handed down to the Pi Kappa
Phi fraternity for hazing a
representative from its national
organization.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee asked the IFC to decide
whether Pi Phi members will be
permitted to compete in in-
tramurals and under what con-
ditions, before the university
committee would review the the
IFC’s punishment decision.

IFC President Monty Briscoe
announced that Pi Phi mem-
bers may participate in future
intramural competition as in-

WLUR General Manager Robert de Maria.

dividuals or in groups as long as
they did not compete under Pi
Phi’s name.

The Judicial Board also
decided to allow the Pi Phi’s to
hold a Christmas party for Lex-
ington children, but denied Pi
Phi’s request to allow women to
be permitted to attend and help
out. Women are forbidden
under IFC rules to enter frater-
nity houses during probation.

Pi Phi President Clyde Hark-
rader told the IFC that this rule
puts fraternity presidents in a
difficult position when they
must sign a statement at the
end of the probation period that
the fraternity has abided by all

Lexington’s police depart-
ment is also _ investigating
several fraternity house break-
ins over the Thanksgiving
break.

Police reports indicate that
on November 26 the Pi Kappa

Alpha and Beta Theta Pi frater-
nities were entered. Some fur-
niture was stacked in the PIKA
house, but nothing was stolen.

And, acting on a report,the
police went to the Sigma Chi

off several men.

Ariel To Be Released

The new issue of Ariel,
Washington and Lee’s biannual
literary magazine, will be
available at the end of next
week, according to co-editor
Channing Hail.

The 40-page edition will con-
tain five short stories, a number
of poems and an_ unusual
amount of photography, Hall
said. For the first time in recent
years the four winning entries
of the annual Mahen competi-
tion will be published in Ariel.

EC Holds
Meeting

Only two matters were
discussed at Monday night’s
Executive Committee meeting.

President Bob Willis read the
committee a letter from Lex-
ington Mayor and university
professor Charles Phillips con-
cerning university security.
The letter stated the city coun-
cil’s policy on security for W&L
students, promising more
cooperation between the police
department and students.

Secretary Bud White reported
that about $500 in new recording
equipment had been received
and would soon be in operation.
The committee had approved a
motion to buy new equipment
for EC use at
meeting. The meeting ended at
6:45 p.m.

The magazines, which will be
ready next Thursday or Friday,
have in the past been
distributed in stacks in the
University Library, the W&L
Bookstore and the Law School.
The practice is expected to con-
tinue this year.

Hall said he and co-editor An-
drew Trotter had a _ large
amount of written material to
sift through this year, and
photographs were chosen from
45 entries.

William Ashe reported to the
police on November 30 that his

_ house on 108 North Randolph

Street had been broken into and
a pair of speakers stolen.

Kevin Carney reported that
-wo speakers, valued at $160,
had been taken from his room in
the Graham-Lees Dormitory,
but that they were recovered by
che police and returned to him
later that same day.

Carney said he thinks the
thief used a pass key to get in
the room because there was no
sign of forced entry.

Head Dormitory counselor
Jake Purcell said that in the
past pass keys to the freshman
dormitories have been lost or
stolen and because the locks
have not been switched, there is
a possibility that people from
outside the W&L community
have the keys.

SeniorsChosen For
Business Conterence

Two seniors at Washington
and Lee University were chosen
to participate in a_na-

tional student conference spon-
sored by “Business Today’’
magazine on the topic of public

policy and private enterprise
last month in New York City.

Kevin B. Dwyer, an English
major from Leesburg, Va., and
Joseph Robles, a sociology ma-
jor from Vincentown, N.J.,
were among 200 students
chosen for the ‘‘Business
Tomorrow VI’ national con-
ference from among more than
1,400 applicants. The Founda-
tion for Student Communica-
tion, a non-profit organization
whose goal is improving com-
munication between students
and executives, sponsors the

   

Dwyer
program annually, in addition
to publishing ‘Business To-
day,” the nation’s largest
student-operated publication.
Participants heard business
executives and academicians
discuss business and govern-

mental concerns. Speakers will
include former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger and
former Secretary of Commerce
Juanita Kreps. ‘
Dwyer is a member of
Omicron Delta Kappa, the na-
tional leadership society; Mu

Christmas Dance

by Frank Billingsley

Space considerations have forced the Student
Activities Board to limit ticket sales for tomorrow
night’s Christmas dance to 300 couples. The SAB
event will be held-in Evans Dining Hall and
feature Cymbol 8 and Board of Oz. Tickets are
$5.00 per couple and available at the University
Center.

When asked why the SAB is sponsoring a dance
that allows less than 25 percent of the student body
to attend, Co-chairman Pryse Elam explained
that 600 people is all the Dining Hall can safely
hold. This number was arrived at by counting the
number of squares on the dining hall floor and
allowing two persons per square.

During Fancy Dress many more people are
allowed in the dining hall, but Elam says the SAB
uses the entire student center for Fancy Dress and
even then the fire code is stretched. Elam added

people.

 

SAB To Limit Ticket Sales

that Gerry Darrell wanted the limit to be set at 200

Elam said that Doremus gymnasium was not

available for the dance because a basketball tour-
nament will be in progress in Warner gym. Zoll-
man’s Pavilion was also an impossibility because
the bands consider the facility ‘‘second rate’’ and
refuse to play there.

“It’s simply a lack of facilities. We face this
problem every time we have an event,’’ Elam
said.

Elam also said that the dance will be paid for
almost entirely by ticket sales, so the SAB is not
sponsoring a dance for a small percentage of peo-
ple with student body funds.

In reality, however, revenue from ticket sales
will only amount to $1,500 while the dance itself
will cost well over $2,500.

For those 600 people, Cymbol 8 and Band of Oz
will be alternating one hour sets beginning at 8:30
tomorrow night. Cymbol 8 is a soul-funk group out
of Charlotte, North Carolina, while Band of Oz
specializes in beach and shag.

The program is not merely a
speed-reading course. Its
techniques are designed to in-
crease reading speed, to
strengthen comprehension, to
improve recall, to sustain con-
centration and to deepen
analysis. A student uses his own
classroom reading materials
rather than mass-prepared in-
structional literature and
mechanical training aids.

This program will be con-
ducted on the Washington and
Lee campus by an instructor
from Baldridge Reading from
January 12 through February
16. Scheduling will be flexible to
accommodate individual stu-
dent schedules, and classes will
be small to permit necessary in-
dividual attention. Each stu-
dent will attend a total of twenty
sessions, five per week. Tuition
for the program will be $65,
payable by the start of the pro-
gram upon receipt of a state-
ment from Baldridge.

Further information and
registration cards may be ob-
tained from the Office of the
Dean of Students, Payne Hall 6.
Interested students should
register for the course as soon
as possible.

 

Dress is semi-formal and beer will be for sale.

Professors Stay On Despite Job Insecurity

by Chris Peacock

Three untenured English pro-
fessors are back this year
despite assertions to the con-
trary last year. The reason,
they say, is a lack of jobs and an
overabundance of job-seekers. -

Robert Fure, Carren Kaston
and John Swift, all fourth-year
assistant professors of English,
said last year that they were
leaving Washington and Lee
because any additional time
spent here would be detrimen-
tal to their chances of receiving
tenure at another college or
university. As Kaston said last
winter, ‘‘It’s not in our best in-
terests to stay here.”’

The problem with staying was
that the national teachers’
union guidelines give beginning
professors seven years to
receive tenure, and W&L’s
English department is ‘‘tenured
up.” Any chances for obtaining
tenure would have to be at
another college, and would like-
ly require several years in
residence for the professors to
prove themselves.

But when they began looking,
none could find a more accep-
table employment situation. So,
they are back, hoping for but.
not optimistic about securing.
tenured positions elsewhere.

Assistant Professors of

English Robert Fure, Carren
Kaston and John Swift took jobs
at W&L with the realization that
they probably would be unable
to receive tenure. The English
department has only one ten-
ured position open and it wants
to keep it open to allow for flex-
ibility within the department,
said Swift. This being the case,
all three are actively seeking
employment at other schools.

The glut of prospective

English professors in the
market has made landing a
position next to impossible.
Swift said he had been looking
for another job for ‘‘roughly a
year,’’ but has been unable to

find a comparable position.

 

 

Carren Kaston

 

“The employment situation for
teachers in general is not
good,” he said. ‘It’s an
employer’s market.’’

As is the case with Fure and
Kaston, Swift likes the mixture

 

John Swift

at landing a satisfactory teach-
ing position. He said that
because of personal and family
considerations, he wants a per-
manent job, even if he has to
leave the teaching profession to

nn.
‘The problems seems to boil down to
the fact that there are too many
teachers and not enough students.
So, despite spending a number of

years working on a Ph.D.

these

professors find themselves with little

job security’

 

of upper-and lower-level
courses he teaches at W&L.
However, he would not want to
teach exclusively at the begin-
ning level. And that is basically
the only type position he has
found available.

Fure has about given up hope

   
   

 

find one. “I will not take
another temporary position,”
he said. ‘“‘At 35 I don’t want
another year-to-year appoint-
ment. It’s too much of a
burden...Unfortunately, the
trend is toward temporary
jobs.”’

He emphasized the ‘‘tremen-
dous supply of cheap labor’’ in
the form of teachers available
to colleges, and cited a recent
survey study which showed that
in the next 10 years, 10 percent

of those with Ph.D.’s in English
would be able to land tenure
tract jobs.

Fure is pessimistic about the
possibility of landing another
teaching job for next year, and
predicts that he may well end
up in another field, such as
business. There, he said, he
would probably have a job
which would use his gram-
matical skills — ‘‘Vice Presi-
dent in charge of commas”’
—but which would take him
away from the study and
teaching of poetry.

Fure, who estimated that he
spends approximately 60 hours
each week on his work, pre-
dicted that should he take a job

in business, it would probably
mean “‘making more money do-
ing something which takes less
work.” But, he added, ‘‘I won’t
have the opportunity to make a
living doing what I love.”’

Kaston, who has one year of
her appointment remaining
after the current school year,
has also been looking for a per-
manent job. But she, like Fure
and Swift, has had little luck.

She said that persons in the
“assistant professor’ category
have an especially hard time
finding jobs. Most of the avail-
able jobs are for those just out
of graduate school. Swift said,
“This is because the salary
demands are lower, and begin-
ning teachers have more time
before a tenure decision must
be made.”

Kaston said, ‘“‘The profession
needs to recognize the fact that
we (assistant professors) are
valuable people.’’ She pointed
out that they have just as much
training as the beginners, plus
much more teaching ex-
perience.

The problem seems to boil
down to the fact that there are
too many teachers and not
enough students. So, despite
spending a number of years
working on a Ph.D. and writing
manuscripts and articles, and
doing additional outside re-
search, these professors find
themselves with little job
security. Fure said, ‘We are
confronted with a_ situation
where we cannot expect to con-
tinue in our profession. I’m still
looking, but not with much op-
timism.”’

He called his situation ‘‘some-

thing of a reversal” of one of
George Bernard Shaw’s quota-
tions. Shaw said, “Those who

should be, ‘Those who can’t
teach, do.

Live From New York... ”
Saturday Night Live ’80

 

Met With Boos and Hisses

by John Wells

Anyone who watched the premiere of Saturday
Night Live ’80 with high expectations was rightful-
ly disappointed. Although much of the material is
no worse than anything seen on the original, there
is an obvious void left by the old stars, who had
carried on successfully for a year after the major
loss of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd to Holly-
wood. It seems impossible that any ensemble
could live up to the creativity, energy and ver-
satility that distinguished the original cast.

Television

 

The new show, which began last Saturday, was
met with a barrage of complaints and criticism.
Tom Shales, the vitrolic video pundit, reported in
The Washington Post that the NBC switchboard in
New York received more than 400 complaints
about the show, an unusually high number. Shales
himself described the show as ‘“‘Vile...a snide and
sordid embarrassment...haplessly pointless taste-
lessness...Cro-Magnon comedy...’ etc., etc.

Well, now, really. The show was nothing to cheer
about, but its content is no more snide or tasteless
than anything we’ve seen in the same time slot
since 1975. The old SNL was capable not only of
first-rate entertainment, but it would also be
tediously gross, and it often sent folks to bed be-
tween Weekend Update and the guest band’s sec-
ond appearance.

Many of the complaints registered were about
one of the opening skits, set in the Oval Office with
the Carter family. Except for the Amy character,
it was a letdown, no doubt brought on by memories
of Aykroyd and Laraine Newman, who portrayed
the presidential couple in several inspired
routines. The new skit was less subtle in its at-
tacks on the Carters, who are seen discussing how
the White House has affected their love life (‘It’s
the election or the erection’’). The first lady unbut-
tons her dress and reclines on the president’s desk
to wait for you-know-what.

If this is a bon voyage to Jimmy and Rosalynn,
heaven help Ronnie and Nancy during the next
four years.

Akron Beacon Journal Editor and Vice President Paul A. Poor-

Editor Addresses

Journalism Ethics

by John Ran Smith

The legal question of the
privacy of citizens is the biggest
problem of the future for jour-
nalists. Says Paul A. Poorman,
the editor and vice-president of
the Akron Beacon Journal. He
lectured during the seventh an-
nual Washington and Lee In-
stitute on the Ethics of Jour-
nalism, Friday night.

“The concept of freedom has
changed,”’ Poorman remarked.
“There is no law regarding the
privacy of private citizens, and
the courts will rule in favor of
the rights of privacy for the
citizen, infringing upon the
freedom of speech dictated by
the First Amendment.” —

Poorman cited two chal-
lenges for the newspaper in to-
day’s world: marketing and the
social responsibility of the jour-
nalist.

“Are newspaper investiga-
tions brought about to sell

papers or to correct society?”’
He asked the audience in his
Friday night speech.

It is imperative that a news-
paper make money to remain in
society, he said. The social
responsibility of the journalist
as the watchdog of society must
be remembered also.

“The journalist makes the
news by selecting and pub-
lishing what he believes is the
most important news,” he said.
“‘We have enormous power, but
we don’t always use it proper-
ly.”

Poorman stressed the impor-
tance of an absolute ruling of
the First Amendment as the
most important thing for the
journalist to have in his favor.

“‘T would like to live in a world
where the First Amendment
ruling were absolute,’’ he said.
“I believe that freedom of
speech is an absolute necessi-

ty.”

The Ring-tum Phi, December 4, 1980, Page 5

 

(continued from page 4)

Far funnier ridicule was heapea un the Carters
by the original writers and cast; they were also
responsible for equally questionable taste over the
years.

Remember the ‘‘Miles Cawperwaithe”’ series in
which Eric Idle emptied foul containers of drool
into a bucket? How about the Nixon skits in which
Pat was frankly portrayed as a foul-mouthed
alcoholic? Or anything conceived and written by
Michael O’Donoghue?

The stand-outs in the new cast were Denny’

Dillon, a chubby blonde, and a skinny lunatic nam-
ed Charles Rocket, who replaces Chevy Chase-
Jane Curtain-Billy Murray as anchorperson of
Weekend Update.

Miss Dillon is suitably whacky and came off
very well in several skits, as Amy Carter, and asa
Jewish talk show co-hostess in “Pinky and Leo
Waxman.”

Rocket, who is intermittently good-looking be-.

tween dire facial contortions, was very funny as a
singing telegram reader, and he pulled the news
off without a hitch (the news has returned to the
stark, unpolished format of the show’s early
days). Rocket may prove to be a more likable jerk
than Chevy Chase was.

The other members — Ann Risley, Gail Mat-
thius, Joe Piscopo and Gilbert Gottfried — all
display individual talent, but only time will tell if
they can develop as stunning a repetoire of char-
acterizations as any one of their predecessors.
But, again, who could replace even the most
underrated SNL veteran, Garrett Morris, who was
great as every remotely black male or female he
played, from Pear] Bailey to Anwar Sadat?

My guess is that the show will be commercially
successful, if not the artistic equivalent of the

Saturday Night Live

original. The format is the same, there is a new,
expensive-looking set, Don Pardo still announces
the opening credits over postcard shots of Manhat-
tan, and new features, like short films by famous
directors, will be shown weekly.

In the meantime, the Coneheads, Roseanna Ro-
seannadanna, the Widebutts, Enid and Lisa
Lupner, Samurai Hotel Clerk and the Bees have
all joined Edith Bunker, the Ricardos and the
Mertzes, Uncle Miltie and Gomer Pyle somewhere
in video heaven.

That’s all, folks.

Follow-up:

A week after writing this article I watched the
second installment of the new show. It, too, was
met with a barrage of outcries, this time regard-
ing a skit about Commie Hunting Season in North
Carolina. Now there is talk at NBC about per-
manently replacing SNL with a new series.

To consider dropping the show at such an early
date is unfortunate. Let it be remembered the
earliest broadcasts of the old series contained
some awful stuff, too.

The second show, hosted by Malcolm McDowell,
had some good material; a skit with McDowell
and Ann Risley in a Gothic romance bookstore
was especially clever. Charlie Rocket continued to
excel with a boffo newscast and hilarious ‘‘man on
the street”’ interviews filmed on New York’s Fifth
Avenue.

Again, I saw nothing on the new show which I
considered any more offensive than material from
the old one. It would be a shame to cancel it
prematurely.

FALL AWARDS

Several members of the
Washington and Lee soccer and
football programs have receiv-
ed post-season recognition from
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
terence. The honors, which in-
clude Coach-of-the Year,
Player-of-the Year, and All-
Conference laurels, were an-
nounced at the ODAC fall
meetings, which took place
Tuesday, Nov. 18in Staunton.

The conference’s soccer
Coach-of-the-Year award went
to W&L’s Rolf Piranian, who
had also received the honor in
1977 and shared it in 1979. Pira-
nian, who this fall completed his
fifth year as the Generals’
director, led W&L to a 9-4-0
record, the team’s first winning
mark since 1973.

Bryan Williams, a W&L
senior from Richmond, Va.,
earned the ODAC’s soccer
Player-of-the-Year accolade. A
three-year W&L starter,
Williams played in 12 games
this fall and scored four goals
from his midfield position.

Williams and teammate Brad
Poorman, a sophomore from
Wilmington, De., were both
selected to the eleven-man All-
Conference team. Poorman, a
forward, paced W&L in scoring
this fall with 18 points (six goals

and six assists).

In football, four Generals
received first-team All-
Conference recognition and six
more earned second-team
laurels.

W&L’s first-team award reci-
pients are: senior Chris Leiser,
a wide receiver from Chester
Heights, Pa. and, ironically,
W&L’s leading rusher this fall
with 555 yards; senior Chip
Nunley, a Bristol, Va. resident
and a three-year starter at of-
fensive tackle; junior Mike
Fogarty, a tight end from Alex-
andria, Va. and 1980 team
leader in receiving with 22
catches for 352 yards; and
junior Mike Pressler, a defen-
sive lineman from _ Wilton,
Conn. and second-leading W&L
tackler in 1980. :

Second-team W&L players
are: running back Chris
Cavalline, a sophomore from
St. Mary’s, Pa.; guard Jim
Forte, a senior from Cranford,
N.J.; center Jon Hendler, a
senior from Ambler, Pa.;
defensive end Tom Noble, a
junior from Pilot Knob, N.Y.;
linebacker John McKee, a
junior from Clarksdale, Miss. ;
and defensive back Don Keller-
man, a sophomore from Alex-
andria, Va.

 

 

Odds And Ends.

—First, some belated congratulations must go
both the football team and the soccer team. As
most everyone who reads this section knows, the
football team has long been the whipping boy of
our sports writers. Well, everyone has his day in
the sun, and the same held true for this year’s
gridmen. 6-4 may not seem like a big deal to alot of
people, but its a long way from 2-8 and 3-7 perfor-
mances. Meanwhile, the soccer team tied the
school record for most wins in a season, beating
the likes of Navy, which has knocked off Division I
playoff teams. Maybe in the future, someone will
realize that lacrosse and football are not theonly
sports played on Wilson Field.

—The basketball team has started — or has
anyone cared to notice? Does anyone care,
anyway” The basketball team plays tomorrow in
Warner Center, probably to its usual overflowing
crowd of 200-300 people. Someday, the student
body may realize that W&L basketball games are
a little more than an excuse to blow off studying.

—We're now less than four months away from
the beginning of the lacrosse season. We certainly
hope that a few members of the lacrosse team
decide to may a good contribution to the team this
year like managing not to flunk out of school.

—On the national scene, George Rogers walked
off with the Heisman Trophy — to no one’s sur-
prise since he is a running back. Maybe someday
the fine gentlemen who organize this award will
realize that there are more positions than running
back or quarterback. Perhaps more than one
trophy should be handed out. Perhaps there should
have been more than one winner this year.
Perhaps Herschel Walker will win the next three
trophies...

—The N.F.L. continues to grind through what
seems like the longest season ever. Looking for
early - favorites for the Super Bowl? Try
Philadelphia in the N.F.C. and whoever wins the
Central Division of the A.F.C. Meanwhile, look for

the Eagles, Cowboys, Lions (if they don’t gag their
division away), Rams and Falcons. In the A.F.C.,
the smart money is riding on the Bills, Patriots
(who will make it despite all efforts to throw it
away), Browns, Oilers, and Chargers. We won't
dare predict a final winner.

—Speaking of pro boxing — if you want to term
certain pro bouts as ‘boxing’ matches — the ver-
dict is still out on the Duran-Leonard fix, excuse
us, fight. Pity our poor amigo, Roberto, he fought
for almost eight rounds, suffered a bad tummy
ache, and only got $8 million for his efforts. It
should keep him in steaks and Alka-Aeltzers for a
long time to come — at least until his rematch with
Sugar Ray (surprise! ).

—College hoops have now officially gotten
underway, though they never seem to end. Can
Virginia finally achieve the national title it so
desperately craves to justify its sports program?
Will Louisville find life after Dunkenstein? Will
Syracuse and St. Johns bring respectability to the
Big East? Will the ACC play itself into the ground
again? Will they ever decide who really is No. 1?

—Back to college football, can “them Dogs”’
survive the loss of their coach and take the na-
tional title? It looks unlikely from our viewpoint,
there's something about facing the Irish in a title
game that strikes fear in the hearts of football
players (just ask the Bear). Of course, the Irish
never faced a horse like Mr. Walker. Expect a true
classic from the Superdome. You can have the
rest of the bowl games, they only count for money,
money and more money...

—At some distant point in the future, both the
N.H.L. and the N:B.A. will get around to finishing
its playoffs. As one magazine noted a few years
ago: ‘You know its summer when the grass needs
mowing, the kids want to go to the pool, the Pen-
nant races are haeting hope, and the N.B.A. finals
are beginning.”’

Enough thoughts for now. Enjoy what's left of
this term.

Fencing, A New Wrinkle In W&L Sports

by Ralph Frasca

A relatively new wrinkle in
W&L sports is the fencing team,
a non-varsity sport coached by
Dr. Jim Worth. In their season
opener, Worth’s charges de-
feated third-ranked U.Va. a few
Saturdays ago. However, be-
fore I go any further, perhaps I

should attempt a brief overview |

of this fast-paced throwback to
the Middle Ages, in which sharp
reflexes and keen hand-eye
coordination are requisite.

There are three divisions of
competition: foil, epee, and
sabre. The foil is a more basic
weapon than the other two. The
lone viable target is the torso,
which can be hit only by the
point of the sword. Hits are
determined by an electrical
device hooked up to the protec-
tive suit. Also, a ‘‘Right-of-
way” rule exists in this division
of competition, which states
that when a fencer has his arm
extended in an attack, his foe
must block that attack and may
not launch an assault of his own
until after the aggressor has
been fended off.

The epee has no such rule,

and differs from the foil in that
it is a larger weapon, and the

whole body is fair game. Simi-
larities are that the sword point
is the only method of contact
and hits are also electronically
measured.

In sabre competition, the
most aggressive and frenzied of
the three, hits may be scored
with either the point of the
sword or by slashing. The tar-
get is the waist upwards, and
like the foil there is a right-of-
way rule. There are no elec-
tronic measuring devices in
sabre, only judgment calls by
the referee.

In all three divisions, five hits
signifies a victory, and nine
bouts are waged. The overall
winner is determined by the
most victories of the 27 total
bouts.

So much for Frasca’s Short
Course on Fencing.

In the inaugural meet, the
W&L sabre team blanked U.Va.
9-0, as ace fencer Clyde Hark-
rader won all three of his bouts.
Rich Ordway, Todd Hanks and
Pat Berg each scored two vic-
tories.

U.Va. edged the W&L foil
team, 6-3. Steve King triumph-
ed twice, and Willy Mackie
chipped in with a victory. King

is a gutsy swordsman who
never gives an inch, whose bold
and flamboyant attacks are
reminiscent of Mick Jagger
prancing about on stage. Duel-
ling well but emerging winless
were Lee Kaplan, Glenn Wil-
mar, and Rebecca Lovingood,
an exchange student from Mary
Baldwin College who almost
stole the show with some fine

swordplay against U.Va.’s top
fencer.

The epee team fared little bet-
ter, losing 5-4, despite two vic-
tories from team captain Bill
Sherwin. Rich Hepler, last
years’s top-ranked Epee fencer
in Virginia, won one of three,
while freshman Rick Swagler

befell a similar fate.

One question looms ever
larger in the minds of Dr. Worth
and his fencers — should fenc-
ing become a varsity sport?

If the team opted to turn var-
sity, they could get school funds

   

to buy new and better equip-

ment. Currently, the team
members must buy all their
own equipment, which is very
costly. Several excellent
fencers were forced to refrain
from joining the team due to
their inability to afford the ex-
pensive gear. A varsity team

would have a full-time, salaried
coach which, despite his devo-
tion to the team, Dr. Worth is
not. The fencers could also re-
ceive a varsity letter and
Physical Education credits, as
is the practice with other school
sports. By restricting the par-
ticipants to those who are ‘‘good
enough,”’ a higher level of quali-
ty could be attained, and the
team would gain state-wide
recognition. Finally, varsity
status would force a commit-
ment from the Athletic Depart-
ment and ‘‘legitimize’’ the sport
in the eyes of the student body
and the fencers themselves.

On the other side of the coin,
the team practices may become
more rigid and demanding,
necessitating several hours a
day, five days a week from the
team members and Dr. Worth.
The team would have to limit its
competition to one league, as
opposed to the freedom it cur-
rently possesses in determining
its opponents. Inevitably, a cut
system would be employed, pro-
hibiting many interested
fencers from participating in
matches or even working out
with the team.
Cagers Win Opener

by Dale Park

The Washington and Lee var-
sity basketball team opened up
its 1980-81 season by winning the
W&L Tip-Off Tournament held
November. 28-29-at the Warner
Athletic Center.

Along with W&L, the other
teams competing were Lock
Haven State College of Lock
Haven, Pa.; Mt. Union College
of Alliance, Ohio; and Thomas
College of Waterville, Maine.

“Obviously, we are pleased to
win,’”’ stated head coach Verne
Canfield. “But I was not totally
pleased with the team’s overall

performance. We lacked con-
sistency and a sustained inten-

sity — but that will develop as

W&L defeated Thomas in the
first round, 79-76. Senior center
Rob Smitherman led a balanced
scoring attack, netting a team-
high 18 points. Starting guards
Carby Hoy (senior co-captain)
and junior George Spears each
scored 16 points, while forward
R.J. Scaggs (senior co-captain)
added 13.

In the championship round
W&L faced Mt. Union, a team
which had defeated Lock Haven
in the first round, 78-77, inanex- |

citing triple overtime struggle.

Brian Hanson scores against Mt. Union

with Mt. Union, however, win-
ning 69-60. Smitherman again
led the W&L offense with a
game-high 21 points, while
Scaggs scored 10 points and
grabbed 12 rebounds.

erman was named the tourney’s
Most Valuable Player.

“I must stress the excellent
leadership that we are getting
from our three seniors (Scaggs,
Smitherman and Hoy),’’ noted
Canfield. ‘Scaggs had a great
tournament defensively and
both Smitherman and Hansen
grabbed a lot of important re-
bounds.’’ In the two games com-
bined, Smitherman and Hansen
pulled in 15 and 16 rebounds,
respectively.

“The offensive flow of the
team is beginning to develop,”’
Canfield commented on the pro-

 

gress of his team. ‘‘This team
does some things, such as ball
handling and the quick transi-
tion, extremely well. Yet we
must keep working in every
area, I have pushed this team
harder than teams in the past,
but that is because I expect
more of this year’s squad.”’

Togetherness Stressed

by Dale Park

Washington and Lee basket-
ball wants to use “‘TTT’’ during
the 1980-81 season.

“TTT,” or “Total Team
Togetherness,’’ is the phrase
adopted by the 1980-81 Generals
as they seek their fourth Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
title and their fifth trip to the
NCAA South Atlantic Regional
Tournament.

“‘Last season we proved what
togetherness was all about, so
we adopted it for this season’s
phrase,”’ said head coach Verne
Canfield. Canfield is now in his
17th year as the Generals’ head
coach and has compiled a
256-151 career record at W&L.

In 1979-80 the Generals,
although posting a 14-15 season
record, won the ODAC Tourna-
ment played at Hampden-
Sydney. W&L stood fourth in the
copference regular season
standings with a 5-5 record. Yet
in the tournament the Generals
defeated Emory & Henry (56-50
quarterfinals), Eastern Men-
nonite (95-84 semifinals) and
Hampden-Sydney (58-56 finals)
for the crown.

The Generals’ sights are now
on 1980-81, which includes ex-
panded ODAC competition
(eight teams are now eligible
for the title) and ‘‘the hardest
first-half schedule we’ve had in
my years here,”’ said Canfield.

Three seniors, all returning
starters, make up the heart of
the 1980-81 squad.

One of these seniors, R.J.
Scaggs from Roanoke, Va., is,
according to Canfield, ‘‘the best
defensive player I’ve coached
in my 23 years.”’ Scaggs will
replace graduated forward
Tom Jeffries, giving the team,
as Canfield commented, ‘‘more
consistent speed at forward.”

At guard the Generals cun
count on senior co-captain Car-
by Hoy from Bryn Mawr, Penn-
sylvania. Hoy averaged 22.6
points in the first five games of
1979-80 before missing the rest
of the season.

At center is Rob Smitherman,
a Mt. Jackson, Va.,_ resi-
dent who averaged 11.1 points
and seven rebounds last year.
Canfield stated, ‘‘the team will
only do as well as our three
starting seniors do this season.
We are counting on experience
early in the season while our
depth continues to form.”’

Behind these seniors are
three upperclassmen who will
give W&L a ‘“‘six-man starting
line-up”’ according to Canfield.
“It’s the first time in a long
time that we’ve had true scor-
ing threats at each position.”’

Juniors George Spears and
Clark New, and sophomore
Brian Hansen are the other
starters. Spears, from Annan-
dale, Va., averaged 10.4 points
as a point guard last season;
New, from Alexandria, Va.,
averaged 8.5 points as a sixth-
man who played in all 29 games
last season; Hansen, a Rock-
ville, Md., resident, averaged

9.7 points and 4.6 rebounds last
season as one of W&L’'s few
freshmen starters during Can-
field’s career.

Supporting these six players
is a group of eight reserves,
which includes juniors Craig
Dye (Buchanan, Va.), and Ken
Jaffe (Wellingford, Pa.); soph-
omores Frank Eppes (Green-
ville, S.C.), and Jary Fechtel
(Leesburg, Fla.), and Mark
Shaver (Quentin, Pa.); and
freshmen Bill Yates (Vienna,
Va.), Henry Bond (Gloucester,
Va.), and John Graves (Nor-
folk, Va.). Eppes is the lone
returning letterman in the
group.

“The team has an edge on
other teams in conditioning and
preparation,” Canfield noted.
“This is a credit to the players.
We looked better at our first
pre-season ~~ scrimmage, after
just three days of practice, than
we did after six weeks of prac-
tice last year.”’

Antebellum Residence Will House

A pre-Civil War former facul-
ty residence at Washington &
Lee University, situated at the
north edge of the Colonnade, a
historical landmark, will be
restored as a research and ex-
hibition center for the universi-
ty’s historic art collections.

The project, a_ faithful
restoration of the mid-19th cen-
tury design, will be undertaken
utilizing two anonymous dona-
tions totaling $500,000 that were
given strictly for this purpose.

Included will be the addition
of a smaller new wing at the
back of the house, which was
built between 1842 and 1845. The
restoration plans were approv-
ed Nov. 1 by the Washington &
Lee board of trustees at its
regular autumn meeting on
campus. The work will begin
next spring and is expected to
be completed in less than a
year.

The restored facility will
house W&L’s Reeves Collection
of 18th and early 19th century
Chinese export porcelain, which
has acquired worldwide
recognition in the past decade
as one of the most extensive
private study collections of its
kind.

Also housed in the center will
be the avant-garde paintings by

   
   

the turn-of-the-century artist
Louise Herreshoff. Those pain-
tings were discovered after her
death in 1967 and premiered
four years ago at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington.
Since then they have received
considerable attention
throughout the art world.

The center will be the first
‘“‘home”’ for the two major col-
lections. They have been widely
shown throughout the United
States and, in the case of the
Reeves porcelain, interna-
tionally. W&L currently has no
facility sufficient to house the
collections or to allow either
research or permanent public
display.

Facilities will also be provid-
ed for the first time for
Washington & Lee students to
study both collections. Students
have become increasingly in-
terested in both the Reeves and
Herreshoff collections as they
have achieved prominence in
recent years.

Various parts of the restored
house will accomodate seminar
rooms, a_ research library,
study areas, workrooms, and
specialized display rooms for
china porcelain intended for ex-
port to the Colonies and later
the United States, as well as

Model of Tucker Annex showing proposed addition to rear.

Judicial Board Meeting

 

other ceramics which were part
of theoriginal Reeves Collection
or added by subsequent gift, in-
cluding porcelain made_ in
England, Germany, France,
and elsewhere on the Continent.

The addition to the building,
which will rise just eight feet
above ground level, will house
the nearly 100 Herreshoff pain-
tings and will also be used for
special exhibitions of other
works from W&L’s art collec-
tions.

The house was one of four
constructed in the 1840’s flank-
ing both sides of the Colonnade.
It was originally occupied by a
teacher of mathematics, the
Rev. Dr. Philo Calhoun, who
also paid $3,500 for it. The other
campus houses were similarly
financed, and the college
gradually bought them back
from the professors.

The restoration announced
this week is the second of four.
The largest of the four
antebellum residences, the Lee-
Jackson House, was restored in
1976-77 primarily through
another anonymous gift from a
different donor.

Student interest in the Reeves
Collection traces to discoveries
of Chinese export porcelain at
the nearby ruins of Liberty Hall
Academy, W&L’s 18th-century
predecessor, according to
James W. Whitehead, curator
of historic art at Washington &
Lee as well as secretary to the
Board of Trustees.

The archaeological excava-
tion at Liberty Hall and subse-
quent analysis of historical and
scientific data have been under-
way since 1974 under the super-
vision of Dr. John M. McDaniel,
an associate anthrolpolgy pro-
fessor at W&L as well as profes-
sional archeologist.

During the course of the
“dig,’”’ W&L researchers have
uncovered more than 4,400
ceramic artifacts, almost all of
which were imported, many of
which exactly matched items in

the Reeves collection.

Fraternity Reacts To Punishment

social probation requirements.

Briscoe agreed with Hark-
rader that the rule creates a
“precarious situation”’ and add-
ed that the Student Affairs Com-
mittee rejected the IFC’s at-
tempt to amend the rule last
spring. “The SAC felt that this
one clause is really what gave it
(social probation) its weight, he
said.

Senior Justice Chip Nunley
said the SAC members sug-
gested to him that affected
students could circumvent the
rule by borrowing the apart-
ments of upperclassmen.

Harkrader said he _ is
frustrated by his attempts to
discuss a rule change with
faculty members which he

believes is ‘“‘unjust’’. “I talked
to them seriously, but they see
us as kids and they’re parents.”

Harkrader is bothered by
another aspect of his perception
of the SAC’s intended objectives
of social probation as a punish-
ment for fraternities. On the
subject of not allowing women
in fraternity houses during
social probation period, Hark-
rader questioned whether “‘this
is the only way SAC conceives
of women, as entertainment, or
maybe they just see it as a good
punishment.”

Harkrader added that he
thinks the IFC has done its part
to correct any inequity in the re-
quirements of social probation,
but that the SAC has admitted

the rule is unfair but rejected
Student attempts to change it
and refused to suggest any
alternatives it might accept.

The Pi Phi President explain-
ed that he does not believe the
incident was part of a plot to
discredit by their chapter’s na-
tional organization.

Harkrader added that any at-
tempt to ‘‘set us up was Mike
Willis’ (Pi Kappa Phi National
Secretary) and not that of the
national organization.”’

Another representitive of the
fraternity’s nationaL national
organization has since visited
the chapter and advised Willis
not to initiate any legal action
against the Washington and Lee
chapter.

Whitehead notes, has_ thus
become a valuable research
and reference source as well as
a general museum collection of
aesthetic, religious, social and
political values in China and
America during the early years
of the United States.

The Richmond architectural

firm of Marcellus, Wright, Cox
& Smith is in charge of the
physical restoration of the
building, and GMSM Inc. of Pit-
tsburgh will plan the landscap-
ing. Both firms have been
responsible for planning all of

W&L’s historic campus.

Automatic Rule Committee

To Meet Wednesday

The Committee on the Auto-
matic Rule will meet at 10:30 on
Wednesday, December 24, 1980
to consider the academic
records of those students who
have fallen under the
Automatic Rule:

1. Students who failed to meet
the conditions of Academic Pro-
bation required of them at the
end of the current Fall Term;

2. Students completing a full
academic year who failed to
meet the cumulative average
required of their class.

The Committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement
all students who fall under the
Automatic Rule. If any student
wishes to inform the Committee
of extenuating circumstances,
he may write a letter to the
Committee and deliver it to the
Office of the Dean of the College
before the Committee meets.

In general, the Committee
grants few immediate rein-
statements. A student who falls
under the Automatic Rule has
severed his connection with the
University. If the Committee
does not grant him immediate
reinstatement, he is not eligible
for reinstatement until after the
passage of at least one calendar
year,

As soon as possible after the
Committee’s meeting, each stu-
dent falling under the Auto-
matic Rule will receive a letter
explaining his status.

ACADEMIC PROBATION

Any student not subject to the
Automatic Rule in December
who fails to achieve the cumu-
lative average required of him
at the end of Fall Term, 1980
(see page 61 in Catalogue),

places himself on Academic
Probation for Winter Term,
1981.

Outing Club
Hikes In
Blue Ridge
Mountains

by Charles Atkinson

The W&L outing club took a
sojourn into the Blue Ridge
Mountains. The expedition con-
sisted of a two day trip with
Randolph-Macon and Sweet-
briar along a section of the Ap-
palachian trail between The
Blue Ridge Parkway and Route
501. On Friday evening, the
group hiked two and a half
miles to a shelter and spent the
night.

On Saturday, the group
climbed to the top of the ridge
and followed it to the summit of
Bluff Mt., then went down to the
Parkway. On the whole, it was a
fairly demanding hike, and the
group set a good pace. It only
rained twice during the hike on
Saturday, but the rain came as
a relief rather than a hindrance.

Though it was misty and
visibility was limited, the sur-
rounding mountains were visi-
ble, and the mist gave them an
eerie appearance. The hike on
Saturday was about eight miles
long, and the group arrived at
the pick-up point by four
o'clock.

WLUR

(continued from page 1)

Another time a DJ inadvertent-
ly aired a song containing
obscene words during the even-
ing opera broadcast.

“We had 15 calls in five
minutes,” de Maria said.

Yet de Maria credits listeners
with having patience and
understanding with on-the-job
training of students.

“Listeners are willing to put
up with the lack of professional-
ism because we have so much to
offer,”’ he said.

WLUR is financed each year
with about $10,000 of the univer-
sity’s money and is staffed by
students. The station was
granted its license in 1967 by the
Federal Communication Com-
mission as an_ alternative
community-oriented station
serving W&L, Lexington and
Rockbridge County. And
according to de Maria, the
primary function of station pro-
gramming is to serve aS a
public service station.

“We try to accommodate
everybody at least once during
the day whether it’s news and
public affairs or music,” said
de Maria. ‘We offer listeners a
cross-section of musical

forms.” As a result, it is possi-

     
   
    
      

eo
a

Alvin-Bennis

ble to hear music ranging from
classics and opera to jazz and
rock-and-roll, all between 7
a.m. and 2a.m.

The FCC requires that WLUR
conduct a yearly community
ascertainment survey to insure
that the station serves the
public interests. Done by
students in one of de Maria’s
journalism classes, the survey
attempts to determine what
problems of community inter-
est exist in Lexington. After do-
ing interviews with religious
and civic leaders as well as
public officials and residents,
de Maria said it is then possible
for the station to broadcast pro-
grams dealing with local public
affairs.

“The FCC wants us, and all
stations, to help in answering
the problems of the communi-
ty,”’ de Maria said.

Considering all the factors
which comprise WLUR, it’s pos-
sible to understand why de
Maria often feels like he is in
charge of the local women’s
shoe store. It is not enough to
stick with one kind of program-
ming, according to de Maria,
and thus, many different people
with numerous varying opin-
ions listen to the station.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Liddy

G. Gordon Liddy—Watergate Conspirator, former ~

Nixon aide, the man who wanted to kill columnist
Jack Anderson and fellow White House plumber
Howard Hunt. He is also the man who will speak to
members of the Washington and Lee community
Monday night as Contact’s fourth speaker of the year.
Unlike other contact presentations this year, Liddy’s
speech will probably be well attended. Liddy has pro-
ven to be a big draw at colleges and universities na-
tionwide. Regardless of your personal feelings toward
this man, his role in our recent political history com-
mands our interest if not our respect. We think all
members of the student body owe it to themselves to
go and listen to what Liddy has to say. One can
understand student apathy toward Contact consider-
ing the weak lineup of speakers earlier this year, but
no speaker this year is as fascinating as Liddy. Also,
none so far have demanded the fee which Liddy
requires—and you are paying for Liddy to speak.

We strongly urge you to see Mr. Liddy. It’s your
time—and it’s your money.

Crime Prevention

After reading our front page story of how a
Washington and Lee student went out and recovered
his stolen proerty, one has to wonder about the police
department in Lexington. We certainly don’t think
students should go out and take the law into their own
hands, we think maybe it would be a better job for the
police department. Perhaps it would be good for one
or two officers to patrol the streets on foot.

The university could help matters some by tighten-
ing security in the dormitories. Many students have
had property stolen out of locked rooms because
theives have pass keys. President Huntley says it is
too expensive to replace all the locks in the dorms, but
maybe new locks could be placed on the buildings’ en-
trance doors with students having a key to that door.

We cannot say we know much about law enforce-
ment or crime, but we can see it and we do think that
Lexington continues to have a crime problem which
the police department seems incapable cf dealing
with. We just hope it doesn’t come to the point where
students have to go out to protect their property
because no one else will.

To the Editor
Sir:

Good for you. You have
restored my faith in the system.
I am referring to your editorial
in the 20 November RTP. I was

It takes a good man to admit
his error. I congratulate you for

Dear Editor:

I’m a freshman here at
Washington and Lee from New
Jersey, so maybe I’m _ not
familiar with the way some
things are done here in
Virginia, but I think I was the
victim of severely unethical and
cruel business practices last
Saturday when I returned from
the Thanksgiving break. I refer
specifically to the actions of
College Taxi Service of Lex-
ington.

I returned to Lexington about
8:00 p.m. Saturday evening ona

man that got off the same bus
called for two taxicabs, one for
him and one for me. Neither
showed up after about ten
minutes. The Greyhound sta-

Upset With Taxi

tion closed, he went his way and
I went over to the Lexington
Motel with my two suitcases, a
gym bag, and a pair of boots.
The woman behind the desk was
kind enough to call the College
Taxi Service and ask that a cab
be sent to the Lexington Motel.
She was told it would be there in
twenty minutes. I waited ap-
proximately forty minutes, and
when no taxi arrived, I called
the College Taxi Service twice,
and both times I was hung-up
on. I started to walk back to
W&L with my heavy luggage,
and luckily I was befriended by
the kind manager of the Royal
Hosts Inn, to whom I am deeply
grateful for giving mea ride the
rest of the way.

Not only has the College Taxi
Service lost a valuble customer
(as I don’t have a car of my own
down here yet with which to get
back and forth to the bus sta-
tion), but I think it was cruel to
let someone wait for a taxi when
other arrangements could have
been made. I would think the
College Taxi Service would try
to so elicit business, instead of
biting the hand that feeds it.
Washington and Lee and VMI
are the life-blood of this town,
and if the College Taxi Service
does not wish to acknowledge
that fact, maybe they would not
like to remain in business very
long.

Sincerely,

From The Editors

The Pi Kappa Phi reaction to their punishment raises once again
several questions about social probation as a. punitive measure,
and right of the Student Affairs Committee and the Interfraternity
Council’s to regulate the personal lives and rights of individual
fraternity members.

The IFC and SAC can bar women from entering fraternity houses
during periods of social probation. Aside from the discriminatory
restrictions such an action places upon the personal relationships
of fraternity sophomores and presidents — we’ll assume all frater-
nity members have knowingly agreed. to accept the risks
associated with social probation when they join a fraternity; one
cannot help but question the authority and right of any University
committee to prescribe such a punishment.

Several fraternities have offered social affiliation to women in
the past, referred to as “‘little sisters,’’ these women are usually
dues paying members with rights of access to Washington and Lee
fraternities; how would the IFC deal with them? Several women
study here at W&L through an exchange program with neighboring
colleges — should these students be denied entry into fraternity
houses while other male students are not? Does Washington and
Lee really want to tangle with the American Civil Liberties Union?

The IFC has also granted itself the right to prohibit members of
fraternities on social probation from gathering in groups larger
than five. Can the University, much less the IFC, really prohibit the
meeting of adult students in a public place or in a non-fraternity
situation? What if more than five affected fraternity members
reside together in an off-campus apartment or country home.

The IFC recently completed perhaps the most restrictive and
regulated fraternity rush in W&L history. Specifically, the ‘‘no con-
tact” provisions of fraternity rush represent very real infr-
ingements upon the personal rights of fraternity members. Can the
IFC really tell students who they can talk to, about what subject
and-when or where such a conversation can take place? A case can
be made that a fraternity member accepts these constraints when
he accepts membership in one of W&L’s social fraternities;
however, the widespread participation by students in fraternities
only underscores the question of whether any group has the right to
regulate the social behavior of other U.S. citizens in seeming viola-
tion of their ‘inalienable rights.”

We do not pretend to know how the University and the IFC should
deal with the inconsistencies and loopholes assiciated with its
policies, but we are certain these questions require attention, con-
sideration and eventual reform.

Student self-government appears to survive at
Washington and Lee, even though it often
stumbles, falls, and perishes at other colleges and
universities. The Ring-tum Phi generally supports
student self-government, particularly the way it is
practiced at Washington and Lee. We understand
that in some cases a certain degree of secrecy is

necessary. However, we also think and believe
that this secrecy can cause problems, such as the
one brought out in the article below. Unlike
students brought up on honor charges, students
brought before the student Control Committee can
not appeal their case to the student body. Cases
with two or more dissenting votes are reviewed by
the student Affairs Committee.

 

 

An Analvsis

Student

Control

And Discipline At W&L

by Tom Baker

At a Student Control Committee meeting early
this fall,.a senior was punished with one year of
conduct probation for assaulting another student
atafraternity party. -

Two weeks before that the SCC gave a freshman
who had a small amount of marijuana in his room
a week of dormitory probation, two weeks social
probation and a year of conduct probation.

The senior hit a freshman, knocking him down
and giving him a bloody nose. The senior’s punish-
ment consists of a warning that if, within a year’s
time he is guilty of another act of misconduct, his
next punishment will be more severe than the par-
ticular act may justify.

For having a small amount of a controlled
substance in his room, the freshman was not
allowed in the dormitories except between the
hours of 12 midnight and 8:00 a.m. for a week that
included midterm exams, was not allowed to par-
ticipate in-any University or fraternity sponsored
activities for two weeks and was given the same
warning as the senior.

“Fair but firm’’ were the words used by Jim
Averett, chairman of the Student Control Commit-
tee, to describe the goal of the committee when it
disciplines a student.

Averett — who has offered to take complete
responsibility for all decisions made by the SCC
—said that each case that brought before the com-
mittee is looked at separately and that any incon-
sistencies that might result-from the sentencing
process are as a result of the different facts of
each case and the individuals that make up the
committee. Averett said it is a diverse committee
in which every member has a say in what goes on.
Also, according to Averett, there are no prece-
dents set in any of these cases and there is no cer-
tain punishment for a certain offense.

Averett did make clear, though, that the student

ae

who had the marijuana was dealt with forcefully
in order to impress upon the freshmen class that
the use of marijuana in the dorms is prohibited, in
part, because it can lead to raids by the police.

The two victims in these cases had differing
views as to the fairness of the punishments handed
out. \

The freshman who was knocked down, at first
angered by the fact that the senior who hit him
just received a year of conduct probation, later
felt that the punishment was correct.

The freshman with the marijuana felt that his
privacy was invaded when a dormitory counselor,
looking at a lacrosse stick, found the marijuana
and reported it to the SCC. He felt that his punish-
ment was unjustifiably severe when con-
sidering the punishments for cases that involved
marijuana in past years.

But, according to a senior who was on the Com-
mittee during his sophomore and junior years, a
person can not consider the actions of past com-
mittees because the make-up of the committee is
different each year.

The basic philosophy of the committee changes
each year because the membership, made up
mostly of class presidents and vice presidents,
changes every year.

This senior also brought up the fact that any per-
son who feels he has been treated unfairly has
always had the right to appeal his case and there-
by bring it before the Student Affairs Committee.

This senior also pointed out the move by Student
Control in the past few years toward punishments
that were more ‘“‘suited”’ to the individual as well
as the offense.

A fine for a wealthy student or social probation
for a non-fraternity member did not mean much
so the committee tried to give a punishment that

 

would suit the situation more appropriately. 4

Keydets Raid Fraternity

Students Attacked, Rooms Ransacked

 

G. Gordon Liddy

Critique, Recap

 

The Sphinx Speaks

by Markham Shaw Pyle

G. Gordon Liddy, renowned
equally for his part in the
Watergate scandal and his
ability to eat anything on his
plate, gave an SRO Lee Chapel
audience a forceful yet disarm-
ing address on his experiences
and his world view Monday
night.

The former FBI agent and
Nixon Administration ‘‘fixer’’
claims the problems facing
America today are not the
result of a spiritual malaise, but
rather of growing, increasingly
obvious inferiorities vis-a-vis
our ‘enemy — not ‘adversary,’
enemy,” the Soviet Union. Lid-
dy sees America as a
euphemistic, a dreaming socie-
ty. We have, he says, forgotten
as a nation that our position is
unique, our good fortune un-
paralleled; and because we
have forgotten, we expect
everyone else to be as comfor-
table, as secure, and as eager
for a peace that would preserve
their position. The ex-
intelligence operative accuses

the country and its leaders of
confusing the real world with
the world for which we hope.
“The world,’’ says G. Gordon
Liddy, ‘‘is a very bad
neighborhood — at two in the
morning.’’

by Bill Whalen

Three Washington and Lee
sophomores and a student from
Hollins College were attacked
Saturday night when cadets
from the Virginia Military In-
stitute raided the Phi Kappa
Sigma fraternity.

Steve Jones, Tad Renner and
Ross Lynde, all members of Phi
Kappa Sigma, and Lynde’s
date, were watching television
in a third-floor room of the
house while cadets apparently
entered through a door on the
first floor. The four people were
alone in the house at the time
because the rest of the fraterni-
ty was attending a Christmas
party at the Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon house.

According to Phi Kap Presi-
dent Rob Brooke, the cadets
trashed parts of the house’s
first floor and then proceeded to

EC Claims Unnamed
Fraternity Slipped

Drugs In Drinks

By Mike Perry

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Willis read a prepared
statement to fraternity
presidents and Intrafraternity
Council representatives at
Tuesday night’s meeting in
which he condemned the ac-
tions alleged by a ‘‘friend’’ of
the university ‘‘that a
Washington and Lee student
gave a guest at a fraternity par-
ty a beverage containing a

 

“only

hallacinagenic drug.”’

Willis further stated ‘‘the
guest drank the beverage
unaware of its contents. Conse-
quently, this person experienc-
ed both social and academic
problems which culminated in
the individual's withdrawal
from school."

The EC President explained
later that he spoke to the IFC
because the incident supposedly
occured at a fraternity party
and that ‘‘the Committee is not
asking any person or organiza-
tion to take any action with
respect to this particular of-
fense.’’ Willis added that ‘‘the
Committee has reason to
believe that this was not an
isolated incident.”

noted that the subject was not
discussed in any open EC
meetings. Willis added that
ionor-related subjects
are discussed in closed
meetings and that the matter
‘could have been discussed”’ as
an honor related offense. Willis
also said the incident involved
“a deceitful action.”

later said he believes the sup-
posed incident occured last

countered the group watching a
basketball game on television.
Upon running into the W&L
students, one of the cadets ap-
parently grabbed a fire ex-
tinguisher and sprayed the
group.

Brooke said he returned to the
house at 10:45 p.m. and noticed
that a first floor telephone had
been ripped off of the wall and
his own room had been ransack-
ed (including a seven-foot shelf
tipped over), heard a girl's
scream coming from the third

floor and called the police from
the phone in his room.

Brooke then raced upstairs
and saw the three Phi Kaps and
the one girl involved in a strug-
gle with the cadets. Brooke and
the three Phi Kaps followed the
cadets down to the second floor,
where more damage was done.
One of the cadets apparently
dumped a combination of
detergent and Jack Daniel's
whiskey into an aquarium, kill-
ing all the fish inside the tank.

Keefe Reflects On
W&L Experience

by Will Jackson

Robert S. Keefe began his
association with Washington
and Lee in 1964 as a freshman.
Two years after graduation he
was back, in the role of W&L’s
news director, a a post he’ 8 held
Paty years.

Now Keefe is leaving. Why?

It's not because he has
developed a grudge against the
school, or just gotten tired of it,
he is quick to point out. “T wish
there was SARE HING I hated
about W&L — jt would make it
so much easier to leave,”’ he
says. He's just looking for a
challenge.

That challenge will lie in his
new job, as an editor for
McKinsey & Co., a large inter-
national management con-
sulting firm — as ‘‘dramatical-
ly different’ a situation, Keefe
said, as he thought he ‘could

 

cope with." Keefe is not a
stranger to dramatically dif-
ferent situations.

After graduating from W&L
with a major in Political
Scietice and History, Keefe took
a year of graduate work in the
same beat ‘vandernit
year which squelched his desire
to become a political science
teacher. Keefe headed back to
his hometown, Milford, Ct., and
began work as a City Hall
reporter for the Milford Citizen,
a newspaper which was then in
the precess of going from week-
ly to daily circulation, for which
Keefe had spent summers
working during college. :

Those golden retrievers sit-
ting in front of the library or sit-
ting behind Washington Hall
may become a thing of the past
if the university has its way
next week.

At a meeting on Monday,
President Robert E.R. Huntley

noted that unleashed dogs are
making life on the Colonnade

hazardous for the average
traveler. Staring this Monday,
the university will bring the
local dog warden to the campus
with the purpose of taking away
any unleashed doggies.
According to University
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley,
the current dog problem is
nothing unique to this school.
Epley said that a dog warden
was brought in in 1976, after
another series of dog mishaps.
Epley noted that the dog
warden will definitely make an
appearance on Monday and
might possibly return on Tues-
day, depending on what he cat-
ches. Any dog found on campus,
wandering around without a
leash, will be considered fair
game by the warden.
To save your dog, Epley said
that the poochie needs a leash,

Tournament Preempts

by Frank Billingsley

Hopes for a large-scale con-
cert the Thursday night before
Fancy Dress have been aban-
doned by the Student Activities
Board because Warner-
Doremus Gym will not be
available.

The W&L athletic department
has rented the facility to Lex-
ington High School, which will
be hosting the Blue Ridge
District High School Basketball
Tournament. Dick Miller,
Associate director of athletics,
said the department contracted
with the high school last Oc-
tober and “there is no way I feel
I could cancel the tournament
when they booked the gym so
far in advance.”

However, Miller is working to
get the gym for the Thursday

and should be under control,
—be it by the owner, a tree, or a
building. The first fine for not
having a leash will be $5. After
the first incident, all fines will
go up an additional $5, with a
maximum penalty of $25. All
unleashed dogs will be taken to
the local Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals.

Epley listed a few examples
of the problem of unleashed
dogs, including:

-Last week, two dogs had a
fight inside Washington Hall.
-On Monday, an unleashed

night, said SAB Co-chairman
Jamie Smail.

Miller said the SAB approach-
ed him with the requests only
last week. Co-chairman Pryse
Elam confirmed that the SAB
only began ‘tossing around the
idea’ prior to Thanksgiving
vacation. Elam _ said, ‘We
thought. that three months ad-
vance (notice) would be
enough, and University basket-
ball ends on that Thursday.”’

Elam said he agreed with
Miller in that the contract
should not be broken but “‘in the
future, the gym should be for
the University first and the
local community  second.”’
Elam added, ‘‘We’re disap-
pointed, but will continue in the
tradition of the Pavillion.”’

The athletic department does

-Again on Monday, two dogs

Hall. (Apparently, dogs like to
frequent Washington Hall).

Liddy Discusses Trial

by Markham Shaw Pyle

According to G. Gordon Lid-
dy, the press is afraid to report
the irregularities he claims
were allowed or created by
Judge John J. Sirica in Liddy’s
trial. The following is Liddy’s
account of the trial, much of
which cannot be checked due to
the sealing of the records of the
court.

During the selection of the
jurors, the defense asked cer-
tain prospective jurors about
their exposure to pre-trial
publicity. Judge Sirica, ‘the
anointed saint of the media,”
refused to accept such exposure
as grounds for disqualification
and pushed the process of selec-
tion through to a rapid conclu-
sion. As a result, 11 of the 12
jurors had not been individually
interrogated.

Five of Liddy’s six co-
defendants switched their plea
to guilty mid-way through the
trial. The jury, sequestered
since the trial began, was told of
their decision in such a way as
not to affect the changes of the
remaining two defendants.
However, one juror was caught
talking to his wife in violation of
the orders of sequestration. He
was immediately replaced by
the alternate chosen for such

Fancy Dress Concert

have an agreement with the Ex-
ecutive Committee and Univer-
sity Council not to rent the gym
out locally more than twice a
year.

Elam did say that the
Pavillion has been procured for
the Thursday before Fancy
Dress although the SAB will
sponsor a party rather than a
concert. He said, ‘‘We have to
find a band that will play out
there and there aren’t too
many. We’re looking at some
substantially scaled down

bands for that night, possibly
Bruce Hornsby or Robin

Thompson.”” Elam noted the
recurring vroblem of proper
facilities for large-scale con-
certs and productions. ‘The
gym is not made for this type
function, the dining hall only

holds 600 people, and the
Pavillion holds less than that
—crammed in.” Many bands
refuse to play at the Pavillion
because they consider it ‘se-
cond rate.”’

Elam said the SAB is in no
political position to work for a
new facility. He said the idea
was presented last spring and
‘went down in flames.” Elam
said that the faculty saw the
idea as just another place for
students to have parties.

Elam suggested that there is
an all-around need for a new
facility. One, he said, that could
be used for concerts, Contact
speakers, theatre productions,
and so on. “We’re really in no
position to bring it back up
again, but we won’t stop ask-
ing,” Elam said.

   

eventualities, and to salvage a
potential mistrial, Sirica inter-
rogated the remaining jurors on
the record. It soon transpired
that one juror spoke only
Spanish. The judge struck the
interrogations from the record
and forced the trial to an end
with the bilingual jury. Liddy
was convicted and sentenced to
21 years in prison, a sentence
Sirica justified by falsifying
Liddy’s record. Due to a
typographical error, the record
was changed on the copy
published in the main, body of
397 Federal Supplements, but
not in the appended transcripts.
The discrepancy is a matter of
record.

Police Chief Urges Students To Lock Up For The Holidays

by Toit Baker

Besides having to worry
about studying for exams and
getting rides home, students at
Washington and Lee must
figure out how to avoid being
victims over Christmas break
of the usual wave of robberies
that occurs over holidays.

The escalating number of
burglaries and robberies that
has plagued the Lexington area
has made it evident that
students should take steps to
secure their valuables.

Charles Murray, the Univer-
sity proctor, made _ several

. gested

recommendations for students
in the dormitories as well as
students living in town. Murray
suggests that students living in
the dorms should put their
valuables in their closet and
lock it up. Also, remember to
lock the door to the room. The
side doors to the dormitories
are also locked by the janitors
after all students have left.

For students living in frater-
nity houses and apartments
around Lexington, Murray sug-
that they find the
strongest room with the
securest lock in the house and

put all thé Hose Valuables in
that room. Also, nail shut all the
windows to the house.

Chief James A. Kirby of the
Lexington Police Department
also suggested that -students
pool their valuables in one cen-
tral location and have someone
watch it over the break. Kirby
also said that taking valuables
home over break would be a
good idea. Locking or covering
up the valuables with a blanket
or box could also prevent theft.

A student can also prevent
thefts with such long-term pro-
jects as recording serial

numbers and renting a marking
gun and putting social security
numbers on valuables.

Both Murray and Kirby stress
that, regardless of all the
precautions the student takes, if
a thief wants to steal something
badly enough, he will find a way
of breaking into a student’s
room or apartment.

To avoid this problem, Mur-
ray recommended a security
service operated by Francis G.
Watts. Watts has a warehouse
under the Campus Corner and,
for a fee of $30 dollars, will take
students’ stereos, radios, televi-

sions, cameras, guns, and
whatever else they want to keep
secure. Watts is insured, licens-
ed, and sanctioned by the
police. Also, this $30 dollars
covers not only Christmas
break but also winter, spring,
and summer breaks.

Finally, Kirby and Murray
both stress that people besides
the student body at Washington
and Lee read the Ring-tum Phi
and these same people will
know how students are protec-
ting their goods.

 
by Chris Peacock

Soon after freshmen arrive at
Washington and Lee, they are
told everything from how to get
to Sweet Briar to the location of
restrooms in the Commerce
School, says Junior Executive
Committee Representative
Eric Myers. But he adds, ‘‘they
should also learn about
alcohol.”

A concern about alcohol-
related problems, coupled with
a Ring-tum Phi article on the
subject, prompted Myers ‘‘to
make a motion to start a com-
mittee whose purpose would be
to look into the drinking pat-
terns and alcohol abuse at
W&L,” he says

After several weeks of resear-
ching alcohol education pro-
grams, Myers decided to try
starting a W&L chapter of BAC-
CHUS (Boost Alcohol Con-
sciousness Concerning the
Health of University Students).
The organization, which
originated in Florida’s state
university system, “‘is the first
of its kind in terms of a college-

Liddy: The Sphinx Speaks - And W&L Listens

(continued from page 1)

Liddy’s view of America’s
position in that world is not en-
couraging. He sees an America
crippled by regulation of its
economy and its intelligence
agencies; an America whose
dreams are the prelude to a
harsh awakening. According to
Liddy, the highly complex US
Army is staffed by mental defi-
cients; he foresees a draft. Our
Navy is vastly outnumbered by
that of the Soviets, and the
USSR ‘‘is not producing such
craft to protect the Baltic
fishing fleet.’’ The republic is
outclassed in the air, outfoxed
on the ground, and out-
numbered on the high seas, and
Liddy expects disaster.

 

oriented organization that em-
phasizes alcohol awareness,”’
Myers said.

An indication of the organiza-
tion’s purpose, said Myers, is
found a BACCHUS publication
which quotes L.S. Mullin in the
Journal of School Health:
“When alcohol information is
presented in a non-judgmental,
accurate fashion, students
would have a better background
for which they could make
responsible decisions.”’

“I’m pretty strongly in favor
of initiating a BACCHUS
chapter here, said Myers. ‘I’ve
gotten a great deal of interest
and support from both students
and the admininstration.”’

Such an organization would

be an alcohol-awareness group.
Myers emphasized that it would
have no moral or religious over-
tones, thus seperating it from
many other alcohol programs.
Also, BACCHUS, unlike similar
groups, is a preventative effort,
not a treatment-oriented group

After his diagnosis of the na-

outlined his career: in In-
telligence, in the Executive
Branch, and in the Federal
Penitentiary System — though
he calls the last a misnomer, as
he cannot recali having met any
truly penitent prisoners.
Recruited into Intelligence in
Korea, Liddy was kept on stand-
by until shortly after the end of
the Korean War, when he was
brought into the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

By the time he was 29, Liddy
had been seconded to the FBI’s
Front Office in Washington,
D.C., where he worked with the
late J. Edgar Hoover. He

The basic goal of the
organization is ‘responsible
drinking through knowing what
alcohol can do,’’said Myers. As
an example of irresponsible
drinking abundant today,
Myers cites the finding that
drinking-related accidents are
the leading cause of death
among college students.

“This type of organization is
something that has a place at
any school where anyone
drinks,” he said. “It’s almost
embarassing that Hampden-
Sydney is way far ahead of us in
tthis regard (alcohol awareness
}programs).”’

Myers said that BACCHUS
would have to begin on a small
scale, concentrating on
freshmen through their dorm
counselors. -

Myers labeled dorm
counselors the “‘main, obvious

vehicle to promote alcohol
awareness.”’ Many of them
have already supported the
idea, Myers said.

Yet he sees an effect of the
organization possibly causing

father, but became so disgusted
with the New Left of the late
1960’s that he became involved
with Republican Party politics.
Having distinguished himself as
assistant prosecutor in Dutch-

persuaded to run for Congress.
While his bid was unsuccessful,
his campaign attracted the at-
tention of John Mitchell, who
promised Liddy a post in
Washington if he would work for
Richard Nixon’s_ election.
Within the year, Liddy found
himself back in the Capitol as
special assistant at the
Treasury Department.

Liddy became involved in a

said Myers, might be that at
future SAB events, non-

Myers said the expenses are
small, but he hopes for financial
support from the university.
Myers claims he already has

Christmas Film Offerings

by John Wells

Hollywood is gearing up for
its annual barrage of Christmas
releases, praying for a hit and
remembering disasters of
seasons past. If you live near a
metropolitan area you can see
most of these over the holidays,
if not, wait and catch them in
the Big Lex come April.

Last year the emphasis was
on sci-fi with Star Trek and The
Black Hole the major big
budget offerings in that
category. This year there
seems to be more comedy even
though the major star-studded
$40-million 1941 was the major
bomb last Christmas.

Buck Henry, who has a
number of prominent film
credits in addition to his many
Saturday Night Live ap-
pearances, directs Gilda
Radner, Bob Newhart and
Madeline Kahn in First Family.
Kahn and Newhart play the
president and first lady with
Radner as their daughter in the
political satire which is
Warner’s holiday biggie.
Richard Benjamin’s in it, too,
and all these funny people
should be able to turn out
something worthwhile.

Paramount and Walt Disney
Productions have joined forces
and spent §$20-million on a
musical version of the cartoon
favorite Popeye, directed by
Robert Altman. Robin Williams
and Shelly Duvall co-star as
Popeye and Olive Oyl, with Ray
Walston as Pappy, Paul Dooley
as Wimpy and Paul L. Smith,
who grossed out millions as the
sadistic ape-like guard in
Midnight Express, as Bluto.
Altman hasn’t had a commer-
cial success since M*A*S*H or a
critical one since Nashville.

Honefully the film will be better
than the wooden clip shown last

month on the Tonight Show. I,

for one, will be disappointed if
Duvall/Oyl’s neck, arms and
legs don’t stretch to’ extraor-
dinary lengths like in the old
Max Fleisher cartoons.

Stir Crazy is a reunion for
Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor
after having been teamed in
Silver Streak with popular
results. The ‘‘story’’ according
to the advertisements deals

with the two zanies dressing up
like woodpeckers, getting fram-
ed for bank robbery and being
thrown in the hoosegow.
Directed by Sidney Poitier and
filmed before Pryor’s
celebrated drug fire last June.
Nine to Five features four
major attractions, Jane Fonda,
Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton,
in a comedy about secretaries
and, with Fonda’s name on it,

‘about sexism, of course. This is

Fonda’s first picture since last
year’s Electric Cowboy,

Private Benjamin, and one
would think the poster artists
would do her better justice in
the newspaper ads. If her name
hadn’t been printed with the
picture in the Sunday New York
Times, she’d have been a dead
ringer for Tammy Wynette. The
score is by everybody’s favorite
composer and talk show per-
sonality, Marvin Hamlisch.

The Mirror Crack’d is the
latest in the all-star Agatha
Christie period pieces. Instead
of Hercule Poirot, the detective

 

Shelley Duvil plays Olive Oyl to Robin William's Popeye in the
Robert Altman picture scheduled to open this week, Popeye.

Tomlin’s first since the
disastrous Moment by Moment,
and Dolly’s first, period. The
clip shown on the Carson show,
by the way, was extremely fun-

ny.

Chevy Chase and Goldie
Hawn are together again in the
Neil Simon comedy Seems Like
Old Times, from the play by
Neil Simon. Charles Grodin,
who with Bruce Dern has filled
the “discarded lover”’ slot left
by Ralph Bellamy and Gig
Young, is again typecast. Col-
umbia, reuniting Wilder and
Pryor, would like to repeat the
Chase-Hawn success of Foul
Play. Comedienne Hawn is
riding a wave of popularity with

in Murder on the Orient Ex-
press and Death on the Nile, the
sleuth is another Christie
favorite, Miss Marple, played
by Angela Lansbury, Her
characterization should be
quite different from Margaret
Rutheford’s Marple in the early
1960’s films. The setting is Lon-
don during the 1953 coronation;
Rock Hudson costars with. two
of his leading ladies from way
back when, Kim Novak and
Virginia’s own Elizabeth
Taylor. Novak and Taylor
should be amusing as two aging
film queens making a movie
together and bitching, bitching.

Be selective. At $4 to $5 a shot,
it pays to be choosy,

—J/, Lennon, Oct, 1980

Late in the evening on December 8th, after a
session at the Record Plant, a Manhattan recor-
ding studio, John Lennon and Yoko Ono returned
to their 72nd Street apartment, The Dakota. Less
than one minute after debarking from the
limousine, Lennon lay face down in a pool of blood,
shot four times with a .38 caliber pistol. Police
rushed him to nearby Roosevelt Hospital, where
despite the attempts of many doctors. to
resuscitate him, he was dead on arrival. Lennon's
assailant, Mark David Chapman, himself and
avowed Beatle fan and a one-time guitar player in
a rock and roll band, was arrested almost im-
mediately afterward.

John Lennon was born on October 9th, 1940 in
Liverpool, England. Neither of his parents was
willing to care for him, so his aunt and uncle, also
from Liverpool, took him into their home. Lennon
met Paul McCartney at a church social in 1956.
Two years later they formed a band called the
Quarrymen, and took on George Harrison as lead
guitarist. The Quarrymen broke up, and the
regrouped as the Moondogs. They later became
the Silver Beatles, who got their name from
manager Alan Williams’ nickname for Lennon —
Long John Silver. In 1960, after numerous
engagements in Liverpool's famous Cavern Club,
the Silver Beatles went to Hamburg. Here they
honed their talents by playing eight-hour gigs
every night at the Indra Club. Months later, they
returned to England, became the Beatles, and
rapidly rose to be the top band in Liverpool. In
1962, the same year that Ringo Starr quit Rory
Storme and The Hurricanes to join the Beatles,
John married Cynthia Powell.

The musical story of John Lennon from 1962 to
1970 coincides with that of the Beatles. His per-
sonal life was even more turbulent. After the mis-
quoted remark that the Beatles were ‘Bigger
Than Jesus” had made the headlines, the group,
but John in particular, was anathematized. An
apology helped assuage the public’s ire, but from
then on, there would still be friction between Len-
non and some of the public. In 1966, he met Yoko
Ono at an art exhibit in England. Two years later,
he and Cynthia were divorced, and she took
custody of their only son, Julian. John married
Yoko in 1969, and they have been together ever
since, with the exception of a brief separation in
the mid-seventies, The Beatles officially broke up
in 1971, and each member went his own way, John
backed by the Plastic Ono Band and then
Elephant’s Memory, continued to be musically
prolific until the release of ‘Rock N’ Roll’ in 1975.
He then disappeared from public life until 1980, He
had been bringing up his and Yoko's son Sean,
while Yoko handled the family business. With the
release of ‘‘Double Fantasy”’ this fall, his musical
career appeared once again to be soaring. His own
aspirations and the optimism of his fans concern-
ing his music were quickly crushed by Mark
David Chapman.

Joh Leniiot was & peliilis. His tilisit shows it
now, aid will combine (0 shaw It always. His
lalents, however, were not restricted soley solely
to music. His books In His Quan Write and 1
Spaniard In The Works have been widely acclaim-
ed by the literary world. His acting talent, as
shown in “A Hard Day’s Night”, “Help”,
‘Magical Mystery Tour’, and “How I Won the
War’, was by no means insignificant. Lennon had
a sharp wil, and although it manifested itslef at
times in a sardonic and dynical way, that was not
typical. He was a generous and concerned in-
dividual, who sought to reach people through his
music and help advance peaceful, worthwhile
causes.

Assessing a

Major Loss

 

When the news was broadcast late Monday night
that John Lennon had been gunned down in front
of his Manhattan apartment, a sickening shock
was inflicted on the lives of people throughout the
world. I am one who grew up with the music of the
Beatles.

The passing of ‘‘entertainment giants’’ has been
fairly common in recent years, with obituaries
and accolades for Elvis, Bing, Chaplin and the
Duke. But for ours, the post-Vietnam generation,
the music of Lennon and McCartney wove a
tapestry that through radio became the
background music of our childhood. It wasn’t until
the 1970's that we grew to appreciate the technical
superiority and lyrical significance of the Beatles.
The songs took on new dimensions and helped us
understand the 60's, which we had witnessed
through the tinted glass of our early years.

The much mourned death of Elvis three years
ago was met with a similar reaction associated
with the loss a major cultural figure, but there are
substantial and personal differences. The Beatles
permanently shoved Presley to the back burner
and to our generation he was practically ancient
history. While Elvis is generally credited with the
fusion of country and rhythm and blues, Lennon
brought to the music a unique creativity, wit and
intellectual diversity previously unattained and
still unmatched in style and influence. And the
spectacle of the gaudy, bloated ‘‘King”’ staggering
to his death at age 43 is in sharp contrast to Len-
non’s introspection and devotion to his family as
he entered middle age.

In the past dozen years, most of the major rock
casualties — Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Brian
Jones, Keith Moon, Lowell George — were drug
related deaths. Jim Morrison and Elvis Presley
were the ultimate victims of their excessive
lifestyles. How ironic that Lennon, who has been
credited with introducing American youth to hard
‘drugs (“Luey in the Sky with Diamonds") and who
crusaded in the early 70's for causes of peace and
freedom, died violently at the hand of a lunatic.
This gentle, brilliant man, who had spent the last
five years caring for his small son, reading, and
raising cattle, spent the last seconds of his life
coughing blood up from the bullet holes in his
body.

In recent months, as Lennon emerged from
seclusion to pursue new musical interests, he ap-
peared fairly frequently in the news. The August
recording session, his first since 1975, was follow-
ed by a rare interview in Newsweek magazine. He
had shed his radicalism and traded his famous
eyeglasses for new ones, On October 9, Lennon’s
40th birthday and son Sean's 5th, his wife Yoko
Ono had a skywriter spell out HAPPY BIRTHDAY
in the sky above Central Park West.

Yoko Ono has been the object of intense
criticism from Beatles fans over the years; it was
she who encouraged Lennon to break from the
group in 1970, (he said he’d wanted to quit since
the band stopped touring in 1966), In recent years
she ran the couple's estimated $230 million estate
as he admittedly assumed the role of ‘‘househus-
band’’. Whatever may be said about her enormous
influence on his life, their ‘undying love’’ referred
to by Letinon in ng. caniot be denied. Yoko’s
statetnent followitig Het Husbatd’s death was sad
and siinple: ‘Jolin loved atid prayed for the

uman race. Please pray the same for him.”

The day of John Lennon’s murder had been
unusually warm and balmy for early December.
The following day was appropriately dark and
rainy, a fitting atmosphere for the Lennon tributes
that blared forth on radio stations all day.

A major symbol of the 1960s, a self-described
‘‘peacenik’’, has been killed at a time when the
world is becoming an increasingly unpeaceful and
unstable place. As we contemplate the senseless
tragedy of Lennon's death, we realize how much
his thoughtful presence will be missed in the days
that lie ahead.

Letters To Santa

by Ralph Frasca

As that frenzied, expensive,
but thoroughly enjoyable time
of the year rolls around again
(Feliz Navidad’ for the
benefit of the Spanish depart-
ment, the laws of supply and de-
mand personified for the C-
schoolers, and a much-needed
period of recuperation from ex-
ams for everyone), bewildered
children wander from store to
store in search of the
dehydrated night crawlers that
Uncle Dwight wants so much.
Santa gets his wife into the act,
and the two may be seen cavor-
ting at more department stores
and parades than one would
think possible.

The most interesting aspect
of Christmas is observing the
children. They fret over
whether to put out Fig Newtons
or chocolate chips on Christmas
Eve so that Santa will be in a
good mood to read the
customary “Letter to Santa’’.
However, don’t be deluded into
thinking that small children are
the only ones who write such let-
ters. Oh, no. Doing our usual
thorough investigative research
(undercover, of course), we in
the sports department have ob-
tained a few letters to the
bearded guy from various peo-
ple in the sports world, and
thought you might be in-
terested.

Dear Santa,

We would like to play in a
World Series. We haven’t been
in one since 1945, when all the
best players on the other teams
were off fighting in ‘‘The Big
One,” WW Il. The Phillies
waited 30 years to make it, and
since we've waited 35 years, we
figure that it’s our turn. Of
course, we don’t have half the
talent of Philadelphia, so that is
why we're writing to you. Could
we in ve some pitching, Santa?

And while you’re at it, we need
fielding and hitting and
baserunning and hustle and...
Your favorite perennial
cellar-dwellers,
The Chicago Cubs

Dear Santa,

For Christmas I would like
Ed ‘‘The Mintzer’ Mintz to join
my team. The W&L sports pro-
gram misses his boundless an-
tics (shooting pennies across
the room with his bellybutton,
etc.).

We need the Mintzer, if only
to promote school spirit. We
lack a colorful sports personali-
ty at W&L, goodness knows we
tried to bring back Dash. That’s
why we need the Mintzer. He’s

_our last folklore legend. Fallon

had him for a year, now I want
him.

Sincerely,

A W&L Coach

Hey Santa!

Could I have the heavyweight
crown again? Everyone seems
to have forgotten me,

Yours truly,

Leon ‘‘The
Wonder”’ Spinks

Dear Santa,

I need a football team. A real
one. The kind that wins at least
once in three months. The kind
that doesn’t blow 35-7 leads. The
kind that doesn’t give up
halfway through the season.

One more thing. I keep telling
myself that Halloween is over,
but our fans don’t seem to
realize it. They keep coming to
our games disguisw. as empty
seats.

Sincerely,

The New Orleans Saints Head
Coach

Our own Christmas wish?
That professors aren’t too
sadistic next week, and that you
all have a good break. You
deserve it.

Toothless

by Phil Murray
When Page Remillard was
appointed aquatics director in
May of 1979, he wanted to
rebuild the once strong W&L
swimming program. It didn’t
take him very long.

Coming off a 1-10 record and
placing 32nd in the NCAA,
Remillard has built a fine
nucleus of freshmen and up-
perclassmen which has been
predicted to finish in the top ten

of Division III this year.

Swimmers Predicted Top Ten

   
 

All-American Swimmer Mike Bernot

Already, the swimming team
has a 1-1 record and finished
first among Division III schools
in the Virginia State Meet. In
addition, five swimmers have
qualified for the Nationals and
Remillard is confident many
others will before the season is
over.

Coach Remillard attributes
this amazing turnaround to two
factors. Of primary
significance is the hard work
and determination of the team

 

 

f a relay event.

members, who come to the pool
every night for at least two
‘hours. The other reason has
been tremendous recruiting
success.

Leadership is provided by
junior co-captains Mike Bernot
and Herb Gresens. Bernot, last
year’s MVP, earned All-
American honors in the 100 and
50 meter freestyle events. This
year, he has already bettered
his lifetime marks in the 200
free and 100 free.

Gresens was last year’s most
improved swimmer and best
distance man. He and Bernot
have already qualified to com-
pete in the Nationals.

Heading the group of new
talent is junior transfer Rob
Crawford, who set two school
records in the 100-meter breast
stroke and 200-meter individual
medley in the first two meets of
the season. Remillard believes
that Crawford ‘“‘could be our

premier swimmer.”’

Other talented newcomers in-
clude freshman Tim Rock,
Kevin Becker, and Jeff Gee.
Rock qualified for the Nationals
by dropping an incredible 40
seconds off his time in the 1650
freestyle within two weeks.

The swimmers are now look-

‘ing forward to a training ses-
sion in Texas over the holidays
in preparation for a home meet
with George Washington U. on
January 9.

Grapplers Off To A Slow Start

by John Harrison
The 1980-81 Washington and
Lee wrestling team faces two
obstacles that head coach Gary
Franke’s past teams have not
had to deal with.

The first is that the team will
not participate in a post-season
tournament. Hampden-Sydney
and Lynchburg Colleges are the
only other Old Dominion
Athletic Conference members
that have managed to sustain
their wrestling programs.

League rules state that fur 4

championship to be held, at
least four schools must com-
pete. When one considers that in
the four previous tournaments
Washington and Lee has cap-
tured first place three times
and finished as the runner-up
the other year, it is not too dif-
ficult to realize that this may
have an effect on the team.

The other problem is a lack of

experience. There are six
newcomers, including four

freshmen. Lacrosse captain
Jerry Broccoli and Barry
Thompson, a two-year starter
for the football team, are the
new upperclass members.
Junior Mike McFadden, who
Shares the captaincy with
senior Dave Stoeffel, has not
been able to lend his experience
on the mat since early last

season, when he sustained a_

knee injury. —
The team’s inexperience took
its toll in the first match, when

George Washington rolled over

W&L 50-0. The Generals later
rallied to defeat Longwood Col-
lege, 32-20. Coach Franke
realizes the team’s predica-
ment, so he is not ready to
panic. ‘Until we get some ex-
perience, which should come in
our matches before the
Christmas break, the team as a
whole will not do very well.
We've definitely got the poten-
tial to do well afterwards,
though.”’

Here is a look at this year’s

roster, with each member’s
weight class in parentheses:
Elbert Umila (118); Scott
Mason (126); Richard
Kopelman (134); Ray Houlihan

Roundball Works For Better
Execution, Ballhandling

by Dale Park

As the 1980 portion of the
1980-81 season draws to a close,
the Washington and Lee varsity
basketball team is still trying to
develop offensive consistency.

On Wednesday, December 2,
poor execution and sloppy ball-
handling resulted in a disap-
pointing 57-55 loss to Hampden-
Sydney on the Tiger’s home
court.

“It was just one of those
games,’’ commented head
coach Verne Canfield. ‘‘We had
several balls knocked away
from us, threw some passes
away and had a couple of our
shots blocked. On offense,
everyone was waiting for
everyone else to do the job.”’

Although holding Hampden-
Sydney to 38 percent shooting
from the field, W&L had only
two players in double figures;
junior guard Clark New scored
a team high 14 points and senior
co-captain Carby Hoy netted 11.
The game was the first ODAC
contest of the year for the
Generals. ;

On Friday, December 8, the
Generals hosted Lehman Col-
lege from Bronx, New York.
Against Lehman, the Generals
offense began to improve as
W&L erased a ten-point deficit
early in the second half and
coasted to a 56-44 win.

“Against Lehman we began
to reduce the number of times
we got the ball but were unable
to take a shot. We also began to
increase the amount of time
within which we could play sus-
tained defense,” Canfield said.

Defense has been the

Generals’ strong point so far

 

this season, and the Lehman
game was a good example;
W&L held Lehman to only 14
points in the entire second half,
and committed no shooting
fouls.

Offensively, the Generals got
a big lift from Hoy, who led all
scorers with 20 points, while the
other starting seniors, center
Rob Smitherman and senior co-
captain R.J. Scaggs, con-
tributed ten points apiece.

Last Monday the Generals
had their hands full, hosting the
Randolph-Macon Yellow-
jackets, the 10th-ranked Divi-
sion II team in the country. The
Generals trailed by twelve at
the half (52-40) and were behind
by as much as 25 points with on-
ly seven minutes left to play.
Yet an incredible surge, led
mostly by young W&L players
off the bench, cut the deficit to
only nine points with two
minutes left. This was as close
to the Generals were to come,
however, as the Yellowjackets
held on to win, 97-88.

“I am proud of the way our
young: players performed,”
stated Canfield. ‘They forced
Macon to keep their starters in
until the end of the game.”

Throughout the game the
Randolph-Macon offense
devastated the Generals, both
from the inside and outside.

Canfield noted “Our blue

‘team (the starting five) just

didn’t have it. Macon tore us up
inside because we didn’t box
them out.”

On the evening, the Yellow- .

jackets grabbed 49 team re-

bounds as opposed to 29 for the
Generals.

Yet while the Generals
managed to tighten up inside
defensively in the second half,
the R-MC sharpshooters hit an
incredible 69 percent from the
floor in the second period to
keep the game out of W&L’s
reach.

“It’s pretty tough to beat a
team that shot like Macon,”
remarked Canfield. “Yet we
came back from 25 points down
to nine points down, and that
shows something.”

Spearheading the W&L come-
back were three freshmen and
one junior. The freshmen, John
Graves at forward, and Bill
Yates and Henry Bond at guard
showed a great deal of
quickness and defensive tenaci-
ty, both in melting down a
sizeable lead and in forcing
Macon to stay with its starters.
Clark New, junior guard, came
off the bench to score eight of
his 15 points during the W&L
comeback.

Among the starters, junior
guard George Spears led his
team with 18 points, while Hoy
and sophomore forward Brian
Hansen each added ten points.

“Our blue players had a poor
game,” stated Canfield, ‘‘but
they are still our blue team and
they’ll be ready to go next time.
I scheduled Macon because I
thought playing a tough team
now would help us later. I think
that we’ve learned from this
game and that we’ve taken
another step in the development
of our depth.’”’

Rock Sets
Sights High

By Ed Gonsalves

Exhibiting characteristic
Texas eagerness, Tim Rock
aims to be one of Washington &
Lee’s top swimmers.

The freshman from SanAn-
tonio aspires to become the
NCAA Division III champion in
two events, the 500-yard and the
1650-yard freestyle swims. Two
meets into his W&L career,
Rock has already qulalified to
compete at the Division III
Championship Meet in both
events,

‘Qualifying is something I’ve
worked for,"’ said Rock, adding
that ‘‘subconsciosly, I probably
believed that I couldn’t do it.
But consciously I kept telling
myself I could. It is something a
swimmer shoots for, and now
that I’ve got it I can work hard
without so much pressure.”’

Rock’s goal this year is to
combine with 1980 Division II]
All-America performer and
W&L co-captain Mike Bernot
and place high at all the
freestyle events at the Division
III Championships, set for
March 20-21. Bernot, a junior,
has qualified to compete in the
90, 100, and 200-yard freestyle
events.

Aceording to second-year
coach Page Remillard, W&L,
in the persons of Rock and Ber-
not, could sweep the freestyle
events. ‘Tim is the type of guy
who, if he wants to, can do
anything; his potential is
unlimited," said Remillard.

The caoch adds that Rock's
potential not only lies in swim’
swimmins, but in academics as
well. ‘In my opinion, Tim's big-
gest success has come in the
classroom. He has won the big-
gest battle, adjusting to the day-
to-day pressure of college life."’

The reserved but fun-loving
Rock, nicknamed “Animal” for
his intense discipline and zany
pranks, came to W&L primari-
ly for the academics. ‘The
academic atmosphere is the
reason I'm here at W&L,"’ he
reports. ‘I am very impressed
with the honor code because I
like the principle that
everybody's ideas count. After
attending a high school larger
than W&L, I wanted to go to a
small school. W&L is like a
family for me since everybody
knows everybody else."’

“Tim is one of those in-
dividuals a coach waits a
lifetime for,’’ Remillard siad.
‘However, it seems as if my
whole team this yea year con-
sists of individuals who are

coaches’ dreams."’ The young
W&L team -two juniors, one
sophomore and a handful of
freshmen — is already good
enough to have earned a tenth-
place Division III prediction
form the American Association
of College Swim Coaches.

“Our team is picked to finish
strong because of people like
Tim,” said Remillard. “Now we
just have to work hard to earn
that prediction.”’

Making A Name

Supreme Court Justice Lewis
Powell. NBC newscaster Roger
Mudd. Virginia Senator John
Warner. This trio would make
for pretty impressive dinner
guests, huh? These dignitaries
once walked the hallowed halls
of W&L, desperately searching
for that elusive passport to a
decent job — higher education.

‘Well, what about luminous
sports figures,’’ one might ask.
Alas, there you have me. Our
school is notable for turning out
Southern gentlemen, hardcore
preppies, and generally suc-
cessful people, but W&L men
are a scarce commodity in pro-
fessional sports.

Raid On Phi Kap House By VMI Cadets

floor, both the cadets and the
Phi Kaps ran _ out onto
Washington St., where more
cadets and some W&L students
from a neighboring fraternity

gathered.

By this point, Brooke claim-
ed, there were only four Phi
Kaps squared off against ap-
proximately 15-20 cadets. The
threat of a major fight ended,
however, when two squad cars
from the Lexington Police force
arrived at the house. Brooke
stated that the police showed up

within five minutes of his call.

The cadets, who said they had
been drinking earlier that night
at Spanky’s, were hostile to the
police according to several eye-
witnesses and refused to be
taken into custody. Several eye-
witnesses stated that the police
had to resort to the use of
flashlights or nightsticks to sub-
due the cadets.

The police then took three
cadets down to the Rockbridge
County Sheriff's office for ques-
tioning. After questioning both
the cadets and the four Phi

Kaps for almost two hours, the
police charged one of the cadets
with assault and two others on
counts of interfering with the
duties of a police officer and
resisting arrest.

Richard E. Collier, Jr., a se-
cond classman, was charged on

one count of assault with a fire ~

extinguisher and two counts of
disorderly conduct and
resisting arrest. Derle ‘“‘Gray”’
Hagwood, also a_ second
classman, was charged on one
count of interfering with the
duties of a policeman and one
count of resisting arrest.
Thomas N. O’Sullivan, again a
second classman, was charged
on one count of interfering with
the duties of a policeman.

The case was scheduled to be
heard Tuesday in General
District Court, but both parties
met on Monday afternoon and
decided to drop the assault
charge if the cadets agreed to
pay for damages occurred in
the raid. An official at VMI also
promised that the cadets would
be “‘strictly punished.”’

In Tuesday’s trial, the three
cadets each received fines from
Judge Joseph Hess. Collier was
fined $200. ($100 apiece for the
disorderly conduct and
resisting arrest charges) in ad-
dition to court costs. Hagwood

was likewise fined $200 for his
two offenses, while O’Sullivan
was fined $100 for his one of-
fense,

Collier and O'Sullivan both
entered the Phi Kap house on
Saturday night, while Hagwood
became involved in the incident
when it moved onto Washington
St.

In addition to the fines, the
three cadets received a stern
lecture from Judge Hess, who
warned that the practice of go-
ing down to a fraternity house
and “cleaning it out’? must be
stopped. Hess said that such
anti-social behavior on the part

of the cadets is detrimental not
only to the relation between
W&L and VMI, but the com-
munity as a whole.

The cadets were considering
filing brutality charges against
the Lexington police force, but
testimony by both the arresting
officers and four eye-witnesses
convinced Hess that the police
tactics were not unnecessarily
rough. The cadets had claimed
that the officers’ supposed use
of flashlights or nightsticks was
unnecessary.

The cadets, now that all
criminal charges have been
completed, face disciplinaty ac-
tion by their school.

Tucker Renovation Is
Nearing Completion

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s $1.1-million renovation of
Tucker Hall is running accor-

Assistant to the President, told

the Ring-tum Phi.

According to Parsons, one
and a half floors of the former
law building are being
renovated and remodeled to ac-
commodate the university’s
psychology department and
computer center.

The project is being under-
taken essentially in two phases.

Special orders and suggestions welcome

In the first, the old library
reading room, which occupied
the back half of Tucker Hall’s

house the computer and a se-
cond level is being added in the
middle of the room to provide
offices and classrooms for the
psychology department.

He said that the computer

Maintenance Plan Draws Mixed Reviews

by Bill Whalen

After only three months in
operation, the fraternity
maintenance plan devised by
last year’s Ad Hoc Committee
on Fraternities is receiving
mixed reviews from the ad-
ministration and the frater-
nities themselves.

“We are tending to be op-
timistic about the plan,” said
President Robert E.R. Huntley.
“‘We’ll have to wait until things
get critical before assessing the
plan’s worth.”

Huntley went on to state that
the plan does possess certain
advantages, including the cen-
tralization of fraternity expen-
ditures and a guarantee of keep-
ing houses at an acceptable
level. But because no deadline
has been placed on the
maintenance program, Huntley
believes the current plan may
not be the final solution, but at
least a framework for future ac-
tion.

“You must remember that on
the economic front, the school is
managing units that are small
and have problems that even

the best management could not .

handle,” said the President.
“Under this program, the
university is providing a cen-
tralized program in which all
the houses have the same ad-

vantages.”’
In a letter sent to fraternity
presidents last summer,

~ Huntley announced that all
W&L fraternities are required
to participate in a maintenance
program under which the
houses are obliged to pay a fee
of $350 a month, or $2800 over an
eight-month period.
“We felt that the program
could only succeed if all houses

acted in the same way,” said:

Huntley. ‘We believed that if
given the choice, some houses:
would choose not to go along
with the plan.”

The fact that all fraternities
were forced into accepting this

plan bothers some of the house
presidents.

“I think the program is a good
idea,” said Phi Delta Theta
President Hill MacAlister, ‘I
believe it was instigated im-
properly, however.’’
MacAlister’s sentiment was
also shared by Sigma Phi Ep-
silon President Chris O’Connor.

“I got my letter in July, but I
don’t -think they (the ad-
ministration) put enough time
into the plan,” said O’Connor.
“It’s hard to gather any opposi-
tion over the summer, and after
rush, the plan was a fait ac-
compli.”

Huntley defended the quality
of his letter, stating that the
decision of the Ad Hoc commit-
tee had been discussed by both
the Interfraternity Council and
the University Council.

“The Board of Trustees has
not discussed the plan yet,”
said Huntley, ‘and they will
ultimately have the final deci-
sion.”

Huntley noted that should the
Board of Trustees vote down the
current maintenance plan, the
overall program will not be
crippled. ‘We have a respon-
sibility to go for a long-range
plan, so we’re looking for
benefits in terms of a few
years,”

Dean of Students Lewis John
believes that the program is
providing immediate benefits,
however. ‘“‘Of the three houses I
recently inspected,” said Dean
John, ‘all had shown signifi-
cant improvement. There have
been noticeable changes in at-
titude and respectability in the
houses.”’ John visits the houses
with the Fraternity Inspection
committee.

Another member of the ad-
ministration who is optimistic
about the program is Buildings
and Grounds Superintendent
James Arthur. ‘‘We’ve been

and a few fraternities may be
dissatisfied with the work,”
said Arthur, ‘‘but I’m pleased at
this time.”’

Arthur listed two main pro-
blems with the maintenance

-program, including unforeseen

complications with heating
systems and insufficient man-
power. Because the school is
providing only one electrician
and one plumber, some houses
must wait before repairs are
made.

Arthur said most of the
repairs made so far have been
routine (‘‘no heat, no power,
etc.’’). Arthur also said his men
have run into a few problems.
One such problem has occurred
at the Delta Tau Delta house.

At the beginning of this year,
the Delt house arranged to have
a burnt-out exhaust fan
repaired. When the fan was
returned, it worked, but only at
one speed. The university took
over the project and claimed
that a new fan was necessary.
The cost of the new fan was
$174, but it was mot covered
under the monthly maintenance
fee. The Delts must now pay for
the new fan in addition to the
monthly fee.

“The $350 fee covers only
menial repairs,’ said Arthur.
‘Because the fan cost over $10,
and considering the cost for
labor, this must be considered a
major repair.”

Chris O’Connor found similar |
displeasure with the monthly
fee. ‘“‘We’re definitely not get-
ting our money’s worth,” claim-
ed the SPE President. ‘The
men are coming only once a
week, and that’s to do minor
work. Considering that the fee
doesn’t even cover major jobs,
there’s no way you can say the
work is contingent with the
cost.”

O’Connor explained that most
of the work entailed replacing
some faucet sets, rewiring the

boiler and replacing some light
bulbs. “All I can say is we’re
paying $2500 we can better
spend elsewhere,’’ said O’Con-
nor. ‘“This is an example of the
university overspending at the
hands of the fraternities.”

Hill MacAlister, on the other
hand, does not have any objec-
tions with the fee. ‘If you’re a
house working with a budget of
$100,000 and you’re spending on-
ly $300 for maintaining heating,
plumbing and electricity,” said

MacAlister, ‘‘then it’s a good

deal.”’

MacAlister said that his
fraternity was not severely af-
fected by the program, but only
because the Phi Delt house
maintains a separate
maintenance account. “I got
the letter after we had set dues
and house costs for the next
year,” said MacAlister. “I just
don’t know how equitable this
plan is.”

President Huntley said the
maintenance program will not
only be appraised at the end of
this month, but a new cost
evaluation will be made by the
end of the school year. We will
chave a reassessment in hope of

reducing the cost,” said Dean
John, “Next year, we can do
this on an experience basis.”

But O’Connor does not see
how the university can manage
to reduce the cost of the
maintenance program. ‘Con-
sidering the overhead involved,
the cost of the equipment and
the workers, I don’t see how the
program can be cut,’ said
O’Connor. “I don’t see how they
can reduce it enough to make it
worthwhile — it seems like a
waste to me.”’

O’Connor believes that the
university should still require
fraternities to pay the $2800 fee,
but the houses should be able to
acquire their own workers.
O’Connor claims that houses
would therefore be paying only
for mandatory jobs — and the
jobs would be done only on a
need basis. ;

“People are getting upset
with the plan, ‘“ said O’Connor,
“but what can they do when the
university either owns the land
the fraternities are on or hold
the house mortages.”’

O’Connor said that some
houses which did not plan for
the extra maintenance fee,
must now rely on alumni funds
pull or some other fund to main-
tain association with the univer-
sity.
Lamented Hill MacAlister:
“Some houses are really bet-
ween a rock and a hard place.”’

“smorgasbord.”’ Keefe found
that experience valuable later,
especially at W&L where ‘the
diversity of topics of material
that crosses my desk is
unbelievable.”’

When the Citizen’s news
editor was transferred to the
larger Waterbury paper, Keefe,
due to “‘an incredible series of
good coincidences,’’ went
along. At Waterbury he held the
job of Public Relations chief,
but only for about six months.

Then one night, Frank Par-
sons, assistant to W&L’s presi-
dent, telephoned Keefe, telling
him that W&L’s news director
had resigned, and asked
whether he might be interested
in the job. It was a totally unex-
pected offer, Keefe says, and
one that stemmed basicaily
from his work at W&L as head
of switchboard operations for
the school and on the Ring-tum
Phi.

Keefe’s hesitation at taking
the position instantly was due
only to his uncertainty as to
whether he could handle it. The
idea of coming back to W&L
was overwhelmingly appealing,
though, and he took the offer.

Two years after his gradua-

tion, Keefe was back on cam-
pus. Two weeks after that came
the Cambodia riots of 1970, the
first real outburst against the
Vietnamese War seen at W&L.
Reaction to the war before

‘ Keefe’s graduation, he says,

was practically non-existent
Some posters, a few letters to
the Phi, but nothing more.

The Washington Post, in fact,
had written after Richard Nix-
on’s successful Mock Conven-
tion visit to Lexington in 1968,
that the ‘radical contingent at
Washington and Lee could fit in
the back seat of a Volkswagen.”
And, as Keefe explains, the
word “radical” then meant
nothing more than slightly
unorthodox.

Keefe was not quite sure how
to deal with the sudden outburst
of political emotion because, he
said, ‘at W&L we had never
had a_ situation when we
wondered if people would get
out of control.’’ Keefe — ‘more
a kid myself than a
‘bureaucrat’ ’”’ — lucked out.
The greatest unrest blew over
fairly quickly, to be replaced by
sit-ins and more passive forms
of protest.

Even at the height of the con-

flict, Keefe notes, ‘‘no one ever
became uncivil — there was
always at least a common
thread of respect.’’ During this
period,’ the Richmond
newspapers praised W&L’s
forms of protest as being more
productive than the rowdyism
prevalent at the University of
Virginia, for example.

In the fifteen years that Keefe
has known Washington & Lee,
he claims little has changed
—“‘even the music is almost ex-
actly the same’? — except,
perhaps, for a short period in
the early 70’s when there was a
greater fragmentation of the
student body, especially social-
ly, than at any other time in his
experience.

Strangely, that fragmenta-
tion occurred after the Viet-
namese war and, in recent
years, has been almost forgot-
ten in a subsequent return to
traditionalism — a_ tradi-
tionalism that Keefe claims is
now being felt in nearly all
aspects of American society.

In retrospect, Keefe con-
siders his years in Lexington as
practically ideal. He thinks the
style and ease of living
elsewhere will ‘‘never even

Hunting Licenses Selling Too

Well, Game Officer Worried

Sales of the new County Hunt-
ing Licenses have already ex-
ceeded previous fall sales of
county combination licenses,
according to Sam Putt, Game
Commission Administrative Of-
ficer, and this raises concern
that sportsmen may be pur-
chasing them improperly. ‘‘We
have had to reprint these
license books twice already,
after sending agents an initial
supply equivalent to the

number of combination licenses
sold last year,” Putt said.

County Hunting or County
Fishing Licenses are issued on-
ly for the county in which the
purchasing sportsman resides.
Agents have been instructed not
to sell these licenses to non-
residents of the county and
sportsmen who might suc-
cessfully buy such a license in
another county would be sub-
ject to ‘arrest for hunting with
an improper license. Game
Commission officials fear that
some sportsmen may mistaken-
ly think they can purchase such

a license for any county in
which they hunt.

The increase in sales of these
licenses seems to be a reaction
to the increase in the fee for a
State hunting license, which in-
creased from $5.00 to $7.50 in
June, At the same time, the
county license was changed
from a $5.00 combination hunt-
ing and fishing license to
separate licenses priced at $3.00

each, Again, these licenses are |

only legally available to
residents of the county in which
purchased.

remotely approach being as
good as here. This place is real-
ly like Brigadoon,” said Keefe,
“I’m going to miss it very
much.”’

Keefe confesses to a real love
for Lexington, and dismisses
the notion that it is a provincial
town. ‘In a lot of ways,” he
says, “this has been the op-
posite of a small-town ex-
perience in the ‘Petticoat Junc-
tion’ sense.”’

Keefe adds that the variety of
contacts one can make in Lex-
ington, from students to pro-
fessors to townspeople to
trustees, is what make it a vital
community and one that he has
found constantly stimulating.

The working situation at W&L
has been another definite plus,
according to Keefe. Despite his
working for a vested interest,
he said, “‘no one ever tried to
get me to shade things. I doubt
many people are given the
freedom — and the freedom to
exercise it — that I had.”

2 Challenge

While Keefe feels his handling
of the job has become more
refined with time, he notes that
“W&L never tgld me to do
things differently.”

Keefe has seen the job of news
director change over the years.
Hired originally simply as a
writer, Keefe has, in recent
years found his range expan-
ding to include work with the
admissions office and the
university’s art scene. Keefe
expects his successor, Jeffery
G. Hanna, to face a similar
diversity of tasks.

In short, Keefe said, “‘I’ll be
leaving a position with all kinds
of personal security and going
into a world where I’ve had no
experience before.’’ He’s done
that before, of course.

And the excitement of doing it
again seems to be enough to
make him put aside his regrets
at leaving W&L after all these
years.

Pleva Presents Paper
At New York Symposium

Dr. Michael A. Pleva,
associate professor. of
chemistry at Washington and
Lee University, is the co-author
of a paper presented at the
Eastern Analytical Symposium
recently in New York City. The
paper, entitled “A Scientific In-
strumentation Information Net-
work,”’ was written by Pleva
with Dr. Frank A. Settle Jr., a
chemistry professor at Virginia
Military Institute. The sym-
posium attracted more than

6,000 scientists from the New
York metropolitan area.

The two chemists will make
another presentation Dec. 10 at
the Southeastern-Southwestern
regional meeting of the
American Chemical Society in
New Orleans.

Pleva, a member of the W&L
faculty since 1969, received his
B.S. and M.S. degrees from
Trinity College in Connecticut
and his Ph.D. from the Univer-
sity of New Hampshire.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

On the Statement

On Tuesday night Bob Willis delivered a statement
from the Executive Committee to the Interfraternity
Council. The incident dealt with the statement involv-
ing an unnamed fraternity (see story, page 1) accus-
ed of dropping a drug into someone’s drink at a party.

Bob Willis’ announcement raises some important
questions — perhaps the most important is why he
chose to make it.

Granted the conduct of the W&L student alleged to
have been involved was reprehensible and warrants
the ‘‘compelling interest’”’ to the EC. Any yet the EC
has always turned its recognized methods of expres-
sion — statements at open meetings, posted an-
nouncements and letters to newspapers — adequate.
If this act does not constitute an honor code violation,
the EC is bound by the provisions of the White Book to
conduct its business in open meetings and utilize its
standard forms of publicity.

This incident may not in fact be the EC’s business.
The facts as related by Willis suggest that this is a
matter for Student Control and Willis has an obliga-
tion to aid the SCC in conducting its business.

On the other hand, the incident may have come to
light during an honor trial investigation or closed
honor hearing. If this is the case, Willis has com-
promised the confidentiality of an honor hearing. It is
doubtful Willis would do such a thing.

Although Willis is not ‘asking any person or
organization to take any action,” we think students
cannot help but be confused and this organization has

to ask what is going on

Clearly a clarification of this matter is in order.

- To Washington & Lee

Dear Editor:

Enclosed the text of a letter
sent to the director of admis-
sions at your university. I await
an answer.

Dear sir,

I am presently a freshman at
The University of Chicago and
am interested in applying to
Washington and Lee for my
junior year of college. My
parents are moving South and I
am considering a more
Southern school. A friend of
mine, a student for two years at
W&L, tells me that W&L would
be a perfect school for someone
like me. Unfortunately, my
friend also tells me_ that
Washington and Lee is all-male.

This is my problem:

I, after considerable thought
and counsel, have decided to

UNICEF
Thanks
Skip

Dear Skip: —

Thank you so much for help-
ing with this years UNICEF
drive. The total collections from
Washington and Lee University
and the City of Lexington was
$502.91. A cashiers check has
been mailed to UNICEF Head-
quarters in New York.

Please thank your friends
who helped you in this canvass
and tell them we certainly ap-
preciate their work. Sincerely,

Arthur Beeton
1980 UNICEF Canvass
Chairman

Skip Cross was student
coordinator for the UNICEF drive
at Washington and Lee.

undergo a series of operations
that will alter my sex to that of
a female. I will not undergo
these operations until after
September of 1982: I will then
be a junior in college. In short, I
would like to apply to your
school as a male and then
change sex midway through my
junior year.

I realize that this presents a
serious problem for your admis-
sions staff — could you admit a
qualified (I hold a 3.5 here at
Chicago) student whose sex will
become female after entering
an all-male school? I must
clarify that I will not fully func-
tion as a female, but I will lose
enough male characteristics to
cloud any concept of manliness.
My friend is, however, mad
with enthusiasm as to my ac-
ceptance and says that I would

fit in amazingly well at
Washington and Lee.

I realize the long tradition
W&L maintains as to the sex of
its students and my friend tells
me that W&L will not become
co-ed anytime soon, hence my
chance of getting in has become

~an area of doubt for me. I am a

business major here at Chicago
and would like to- attend W&L
very much.

Needless to say, my fate has
become something of frustra-
tion for me and my family: it is
one reason why I opt to leave
Chicago. Reach me care of my
friend (address enclosed).

Sincerely,
Jefferson Cohen

Spectator:

More Lost In Space

Due to the most wretched and grevious predica-
ment inherent in any publication, a lack of finan-
cial support, ‘Spectator’ was not printed in the
Phi’s Thanksgiving issue. And due to the most
wretched and grevious predicament inherent in
this newspaper, mismanagement and indifference
towards high wisdom, Spectator’s column was lost
and could not be published in last week’s issue.
Horrors, indeed; is this anyway to run a
newspaper? And so to my devoted readers in the
bookstore and elsewhere, I offer you a double
feature to appease your whetted thirst for
knowledge.

When last I left you, Washington and Lee was
preparing to leave the now co-ed, and hence over-
crowded, facilities in Lexington and journey forth
to its new home in the Valley of Eros on the planet
Venus. The preparations went well enough, but the
journey was a disaster.

Due to a small oversight on the part of the
plumbers and electricians (who did such a splen-
did job, at a truly splendid cost, of repairing the
leaking faucets in the leaking fraternities), a key
component of transformer was not installed. When
the students and teachers were beamed up to
Venus, the results were catastrophic. Men were
plagued with female contraptions and ladies were
burdened with male appliances. A truly mix-and-
match affair; no one knew exactly what gender he
or she was. One could say, with appropriate hor-
ror, that Washington and Lee was once again, a
single-sex institution.

More Spectator

At any rate, the community coped as well they
could with what they had. Stimulators were turned
on and the waterbeds were filled up. New faculty
positions were created as the old chairs simply
would not suffice for these changed instructors.
So, too, new courses had to be devised in do-it-
yourself technology. But the sun smiled on these
happy creatures until...the dreaded Martians at-
tacked, and the clouds rolled in.

These dreaded Martians are gooselike creatures
renowned for their rude honkings and devastating
social failures. The lovely garden of Eros was tar-
red and feathered with dung and down; the alarms
and sirens clamored with the dreaded news:

“The social disease is here: The social disease is
here! Run, run for cover.”

But to no avail, for the geese were everywhere,
smothering the campus with their downy cen-
soreds. The head honker started hissing and
squeaked:

“Don’t run away, please don’t run away. We
Martians just want to play. We want to be like the
beautiful people of Washington and Lee!”’

Enter Spectator, your hero. With my shotgun
loaded with wit and humor, I personally wiped out
all the geese (not to mention the infamous Frodo
the Dodo bird). They are reduced to nothing more
than a pile of overly fragrant pate. They are but
feathers in the quill of genius. Or as they say at
Washington and Lee on Venus, ‘‘How would you
like to come back to my place and check out my
goose down comforter.”

A Christmas Carol?

Hark! The herald midwives sing
Glory to the rackdate king!
Piece of *** and parties wild,,
‘Studs and lasses reconciled! ,
Joyful, all of you arise,

Join the triumph of these highs;
With demonic boast proclaim
Your bastard son and his name!
Hark! The herald midwives sing
Glory to the rackdate king!

He, by all the ladies much adored,
Stud, the everlasting party lord;
Long desired behold him come,
Finding, here the frat his home.
Veiled in smoke, a king to see,

Watch him beg you pridelessly.
Pleased as man with dame to dwell.
Stud with flattery, does so well!
Hark! The herald midwives sing
Glory to the rackdate king!

Mild he lets his pride go by,

Born that would never cry,

When he sees her face so queer,
Born to raise the bastards here!
Rising with liquor on their breath,
New snakes chase in lasting quest.
Hail the kings of studliness!

Hail the Prince of Pridelessness!
Hark! The herald midwives sing
Glory to the rackdate king!

University Calls In Dog Warden
To Solve Dog Problem

Dogs on campus are becoming a problem, One jumped a campus
mailman recently. They are going into buildings and making
messes. They are fighting and disrupting classes, and they are
damaging campus plantings.

Dog owners are reminded that Lexington has a strict leash law. It

provides that dogs are not allowed to run at large; they must be
under the control of their owners or custodians by means of leash,
chain, or rope when off the owner's property. Fines ranging from

$5-$25 are prescribed for violations of the ordinance.

Please take notice that the University intends to invite the City
dog warden onto the campus to impound dogs running at large.
Dogs impounded will be taken to the local SPCA shelter where they
will be held until claimed for up to five days. Dogs not claimed after
five days may be disposed of.

Trustee Has A Daughter, Too.

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

W&L men will perhaps be especially interested in knowing that
in addition to the three sons named in the article announcing his
election to the Board of Trustees, Mr. Ross Millhiser also has a
daughter, Mary McGue Millhiser.

More Alumni At Wlur

Dear Editor:

Last week's story about
WLUR-FM contains an error of
fact which I feel needs correc-
tion. The error occurs in the se-
cond sentence of the second
paragraph, on page one.

The entire staff of WLUR is
not, repeat not students.
Besides myself, I know of at
least two other alumni who are
regularly active in broad-
casting over the airwaves of
WLUR. They are Jeff Badgett,
78, who is another unindicted
co-conspirator for the program
‘Russian Roulette’? with
myself and sometimes Mr. de
Maria, and Doug Harwood, ’74,
who has become somewhat of

aii institution with his Saturday
night ‘*Anti-Headache
Machine.”’

Lately I’ve heard a good bit of
griping about the type of pro-
gramming offered by WLUR. I
would remind those people who
are less than happy with the sta-
tion that no one is forcing them
to listen, and that the basic con-
cept underlying WLUR-FM is to
offer an alternative to the trash
which passes itself off as com-
mercial radio in these parts.

Last but not least, thanks for
the pic. I couldn’t have done
better myself.

Sincerely,
W. Patrick Hinely, ’73

Ed Johnson sits in his
research room in the bottom
floor of Parmly Hall. It is not
entirely coincidental that
Johnson’s room is isolated from
the rest of the university.

What makes Johnson unique
is that he was selected as a
Rhodes Scholar,.the first to be
chosen since 1977 and the 12th in
the hisotry of Washington and
Lee. Johnson, who is a senior
from Natchez, Ala., will earn
two degrees when he graduates
this year, one in physics and one
in mathematics.

“Don’t get me wrong, I have
nothing against the people in
the physics department,” said
Johnson,” this research set-up

been terrific. But this school
has not been what I wanted it to
be.”

decision to attend Washington
and Lee was the result of apply-

having any real advice on
where to go.

Johnson. ‘‘I’m not sure if lama

No Thefts

Although students might have
come back to find bad grades or
cold weather, no one at
Washington and Lee came back
to find his dorm room, apart-
ment or fraternity house had
been broken into.

Charles Murray, the Univer-
sity Proctor, said that as of
Tuesday afternoon, no one had
been to see him to report a
break-in or theft.

Murray attributed the lack of
break-ins to several factors. As
he always does, Murray kept an
eye on the fraternity houses and
inspected them daily. Also,
many students took advantage

to win. Ten people in Alabama
made the “‘first cut,’’ of which
two were chosen to attend the
regional finals in New Orleans.
Johnson found himself com-
peting against finalists from
Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkan-
sas, Texas and Oklahoma. Of
these 12 regional finalists, only
four were awarded scholar-
ships.

While he is attending Cam-
bridge University on his two-
year scholarship, Johnson plans
to study British science. After
his scholarship expires,
Johnson said he will ask for a
one-year extension so he can
complete a Phd. degree.

In contrast to his enthusiasm
over attending Cambridge,
Johnson said he has been disap-
pointed in his experiences at
W&L. Johnson also claimed

that 10 years was a fair punish-

And while most Washington

the week before Christmas,
Lexington police were busy
dealing with several incidents
of vandalism.

On Dec. 17 Dale Sutton,

that a leather coat was missing

Finally, just before

threatened with a stay in the

Drunk Driver Hit Walking Home

On January 5 Los Angeles
police told a man to walk home
because he was too intoxicated
to drive. The man was injured
ina freak accident when he was
hit by a riderless motorcycle,
say police.

The 24-year-old man _ was
riding in a car with a friend
over the weekend when police
stopped them and cited the
driver for drunken driving. The
driver, who was not identified,
was taken away in a squad car,

but officers let Bryan go after
telling him he was too drunk to
drive and would have to walk
home.

A police officer said the
drunken driver turned into a
victim while he was taking his
belongings out of the car — a
driverless motorcycle hit him.
The motorcycle’s driver had
been thrown off moments
before in an unrelated accident.
Bryan was treated for injuries
at a local hospital and released.

Science Foundation Awards
Research Grant To Jarrard

 

L.E. JARRARD

Leonard E. Jarrard, head of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s psychology department,
has received a $97,000 research
grant from the National Science
Foundation to continue his in- .
vestigations into a segment of
the brain known as the hip-
pocampus that is associated
with disorders including epilep-
sy.

Dr. Jarrard’s research on the
hippocampus has been sup-
ported by the NSF continuously
since 1966, and its grants to him
now total more than a third of a
million dollars.

The hippocampus, which
derives: its name from _ its
seahorse shape, was earlier
believed to be associated chief-
ly with memory, and some of
Jarrard’s research continues to
explore this involvement.

More recently, however, its
connection with serious
disorders, including hyperac-

tivity as well as epilepsy, has
become a central focus of scien-
tific investigation, including
that of Jarrard — who has
become one of the foremost
authorities in the field.

Recent studies have shown
that the hippocampus can be
damaged by lead in the air and
in drinking water — and also by
the drug Valium consumed dur-
ing formative years or by a
mother during her pregnancy.

- Jarrard uses specially bred
laboratory rats for his ex-
perimentation. His research
results with those specimens
have been borne out by subse-
quent studies undertaken by
other scientists on other
animals, including humans.

One of his new research
techniques employs a natural
chemical substance, kanic acid,
derived from a_ variety of
seaweed found off the cost of
Japan. Kanic acid allows lab
researchers to affect specific
parts of neurons (nerve cells) in
the hippocampus with much
more precision than previously
had been possible, and ex-
periments can therefore be
monitored and controlled with
greater accuracy.

An effect of kanic acid is that

- itis likely to induce an epileptic

seizure in a lab rat. But the
research has shown that the
same Valium that can damage
the hippocampus of a baby rat
may paradoxically relieve the
symptoms of epilepsy caused
by the kanic acid.

In his hippocampus work,
Jarrard is assisted by W&L
undergraduates, both through
the NSF grant and through the
university’s own Robert E. Lee
Research Program, created 20
years ago by a $250,000 gift from
an 1899 alumnus, the late Dr.
Gustavus Benz Capito of
Charleston, W.Va.

His research has generated
attention beyond the NSF; the
Environmental Protection
Agency is deeply interested in
his studies of the effects of lead
absorbed into the brain, and the
pharmaceutical firm that
manufactures Valium is supply-
ing that drug for his Valium-
based line of lab experimenta-
tion.

He has written three dozen
scholarly articles and delivered
a number of research papers to
conferences of his fellow
psychological researchers, in-
cluding an_ international
meeting last year sponsored by
the National Institute of Mental
Health.

Jarrard has taught at
Washington and Lee since 1959,
when he received his Ph.D.
from Carnegie-Mellon Universi-
ty in Pittsburgh, with the excep-
tion of five years from 1966 to
1970 when he returned to
Carnegie-Mellon, spending the
last three years there as chair-
man of the graduate program in
psychology. He returned to
W&L largely, he said, because
he missed having routine con-
tact with undergraduates.

Herreshoff Show Opens

by John Wells

Who was Louise Herreshoff,
and why are her paintings on
display in duPont Gallery?

She was a New York-born ar-
tist of considerable talent who
studied in Europe, lived in
Paris at the turn of the century
when it was the art center of the
world, and who stopped pain-
ting in 1927. In 1941 she married
a Washington and Lee Law
graduate, Euchlin D. Reeves,
who was 28 years her junior.
Upon their deaths in 1967, their
extensive porcelain collection
and her paintings were given to
the university.

One hundred years after her
birth, in the fall of 1976, an ex-
hibition entitled “Louise Her-
reshoff: An American Artist
Discovered’’ went on display at
the Corcoran Gallery of Art in

 

Washington, D.C. The exhibit is
currently being shown in du-
Pont until the end of the month.

It is indeed a show to see, an
impressive blend of styles from
the early 20th century. The ear-
ly works, portraits, reflect a
classical style attained when
Herreshoff studied under plein-
air artist Raphael Collin. This
influence continued when she
moved to Paris in 1898.

She returned to New York in
1903 displaying a passion for
color in her work. She painted
landscapes and still lifes ‘‘that
might well have been exhibited
next to the best of the Expres-
sionists in the Armory Show of
1913,” according to Norman
Hirschl or Hirsch] & Adler
Galleries in New York City. .

Herreshoff was extremely
devoted to a maiden aunt,

Aunt Lizzie, No. 2, 1926, Oil on Canvas.

Elizabeth, with whom she lived
for 15 years beginning in 1911.
When the aunt died in 1927, she
quit painting altoether and had
most of her canvasses put away
in the attic. The paintings were
brought to W&L along with the
barrels of bequeathed porcelain
in 1967.

The paintings, brightly col-
ored with bold strokes, are
enhanced by some _ personal

Commentary

 

by Ralph Frasca

Fans who attended the
basketball game against Rhode
Island College two nights ago
witnessed what could only be
described a romp. W&L simply
rolled over the Anchormen,
dealing them a 92-57 pasting.
However, this blow-out was dif-
ferent from the usual blow-out
in that the game was not a
debasing, circus-like humilia-
tion that one normally
associates with 35-point vic-
tories. Neither team played as
though the contest were one-
sided; the Generals merely ac-
cumulated the hoops in a very
patient and deliberate manner.

Head Coach Verne Canfield
has seen fit to employ a very
methodical and structured style
of play on his team, as opposed
to run-and-gun, razzle-dazzle
tactics demonstrated by not on-
ly Rhode Island, but a number
of W&L foes. Canfield obviously
believes in disciplined play, and
it works — witness the team’s

6-3 record. :
his penchant for structure is

most evident in the team’s
defense. Their 2-3 zone deserves

a kudos for its fine mobility, like

so many pseudopods of an
amoeba (how do you like that
analogy, Biology depart-
ment?). As is the case in so
many contests, Rhode Island
lost the game underneath the
boards. Rob Smitherman and
Brian Hanson shut off the key,
and the Anchormen found
themselves forcing outside
shots and trying to plow through
the wall of bodies for layups,
neither of which proved suc-
cessful. And it certainly doesn’t
hurt the Generals to have six
men over 6’3’’, while Rhode
Island had only one.

Yet another reason for the
staggering triumph was the
bench. When Canfield went to
his subs he found no lack of
talent. Freshman John Graves
demonstrated some sharp (six
for six) free-throw shooting,
while classmate Bill Yates ex-
ploded for seven quick points in
only a few minutes of playing
time. Ken Jaffe demonstrated
some aggressive defense, and
Clark New chipped in with ten
points. However, as is often the
case, Carby Hoy and Rok
Smitherman earned game
honors. Hoy netted 20 points
with some lethal outside
shooting, while Smitherman us
ed his picture-perfect shot t
score 11.

The Generals now embark on
a lengthy homestand, playing
six more times in the friendly
confines of Warner Gym before
taking to the road once again. I
heartily suggest that you check
out a basketball game, such as
the W&L Invitational Tourna-
ment on tap tomorrow and

Nunley Wins Scholarship

Lonnie D. “‘Chip’’ Nunley, a
Washington and Lee Universiny
senior from Bristol, Va. and a
three-year W&L football letter-:
man, has received a $2000
NCAA Post-Graduate Scholar-
ship.

Nunley is one of 33 college
football players from across the
nation to earn the scholarship
this year. He is the ninth W&L
student-athlete and sixth foot-
ball player to win the award,
which was first offered during
the 1964-65 academic year.

The 6-3, 220-pound Nunley
was a three-year starter at of-
fensive tackle, where he earned
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference (ODAC) first-team
honors his junior and senior
years. He has also earned three
varsity letters for W&L track.

An English and politics ma-
jor, Nunley carries a 3.36 grade
point average. He is a member
of Omicron Kappa Delta, the
national honorary leadership
fraternity founded at W&L in
1914, and the Phi Kappa Psi
social fraternity. He serves as
vice president of the Inter-

Fraternity Council and as an
assistant head dorm counselor.

Chip Nunley, NCAA Scholarship Winner.

‘“‘When I came to W&L three
years ago, Chip was a big fellow
with a long ways to go on the
football field,’ said head foot-
ball coach Gary Fallon, whose
1980 Generals posted a 6-4
record, the first winning mark
in 13 years. ‘‘We had a talk one
day about his potential and
since that time, he’s worked
hard and made himself a true

athlete, scholar, and leader.

“‘He has proven that one can
fulfill academic and athletic
goals in college. He’s been in-
strumental at helping younger
players with their athletic load
on the field and their academic
load off the field. He has ex-
emplified the W&L philosophy
of the ‘complete student-
athlete.”

Wrestlers Look To 1981

by John Harrison
With the 1980 portion of the
season complete, the

Washington and Lee wrestling
team doesn’t have any resolu-
tions for the new year. What it
does hope to accomplish in the
second half is to take every ad-
vantage of the experience ob-
tained in the first four meets.

The emphasis for most team
members at this point remains
to gain valuable mat experience
against its competition. With 70
percent of the squad made up of
newcomers, the Generals are
eager to improve on their 1-2
dual meet record and to recover
from a 41-9 loss to VMI in their
last meet before the Christmas
break.

Head coach Gary Franke sees
no reason to panic, particularly
with less than a third of the
schedule complete. ‘“‘We’ve got
good athletes, ones who will

achieve individual success as
the season moves along. And as
they earn it, we’ll see team suc-
cess.”’

Coach Franke is quick to
point out the caliber of W&L’s
competition in its previous
meets. “We hope that as a
result of having taken on Divi-
sion I an II teams, our guys can
learn and prepare for the rest of
the season.’ The competition
doesn’t get any easier for W&L,
at least not in the near future.
The Generals host both Duke
and Campbell College of North
Carolina in Warner Center this
Saturday at 1:30. The following
Wednesday, the Generals will
host New Jersey’s Glassboro
State College at 7:30. All three
schools have strong reputations
and should prove to be a
challenge for the Generals.

From the injury list comes
both good and bad news. The

latter is that freshman Richard
Kopelman (134) is out with a
foot infection. Sophomore Ray
Houlihan will take his place.
The former is that junior cap-
tain Mike McFadden (158) will
be able to return to action for
the first time in more than a
year; however, he will have to
earn his way onto the roster by
beating out freshman Tim
Valliere, who is currently the
starter in the 158-pound class.

Cagers Win Three, Drop One Swimmers Excel

by Dale Park

“We gave a good, solid team
effort on both ends of the
court,” stated W&L varsity
basketball coach Verne Can-
field after watching his team
crush visiting Rhode Island Col-
lege, 92-57.

Against Rhode Island, the
Generals were never threaten-
ed. After leading by only 12
points (39-27) at the half, the
W&L offense erupted in the se-
cond half to put away the An-
chormen.

Leading the Generals was co-
captain Carby Hoy. The senior
guard had his best game so far
this season, regaining his
shooting touch and going 10 of 14
from the field for a team-high 20
points.

The Generals’ balanced scor-
ing attack included six players
in double figures. Senior co-
captain R.J. Scaggs, a forward,
scored 12 points while his
classmate, center Rob Smither-
man, netted 11.

Junior guard George Spears,
the team’s leading scorer, con-
tributed: 10 points, while. the
final member of the starting
five, sophomore forward Brian
Hanson, scored six points.

The W&L bench provided a

big 20-point effort from two

players: both junior guard
Clark New and freshman for-
ward John Graves scored ten
points each.

“We accepted the fact that we’

have been playing under our
potential,”” commented Can-
field, ‘‘and against Rhode
Island we took one step toward
that potential.’’

Offensively, at least, the
' Rhode Island game compared
to the Generals’ surprising
108-104 win over Alderson-
Broaddus earlier in the season.

Said Canfield: ‘‘The
Alderson-Broaddus game was
obviously one of the best games
we've ever played here. They
full-court pressed us the whole
game and that tends to open

 

step with the quick A-B team,
and regulation play ended in a
98-all tie.

The score was again tied at
104-all with 1:42 left in the over-
time period, when George
Spears took control of the game.

Spears scored on an 18-foot
jumper with only seconds re-
maining as the Generals pulled

‘in front, 106-104. A-B, although

having no time-outs remaining,
called one anyway, resulting in
a teachnical foul. Spears then
iced the game with two free
throws.

“This team has the potential
to score big,’’ explained Can-
field. Hanson, Spears and Hoy
all scored 20 points apiece,
followed by Smitherman with
16, Scaggs with 13 and New with
10.

On Jan. 2-3, W&L competed in
the Washington & Jefferson
Tournamnent.

In the opening round, W&L
faced Rochester (ranked ninth
in the latest Division III poll
with a 10-0 record). Although
the Generals led by five points,
35-30, at the half, a poor
shooting performance in the se-
cond half, combined with 64 per-
cent shooting by Rochester,
resulted in the 82-68 loss.

George Spears drives against Rhode Island.

follow-up shots — both high
precentage types of shots.”’

None of W&L’s starting five
shot 50 percent from the field,
with Smitherman ‘and Spears
leading the scoring with 11 and
12 points, respectively.

In the consolation game
against Washington & Jeffer-
son, the Generals corrected
their problems from the night
before, scoring ten times on
easy lay-ups from the defense,
and coasting to an 84-66 victory.

Leading W&L was Scaggs
with 16 points. Other big scorers
wereSpears, who contributed 14
points, and Smitherman, who
chipped in 12.

The Generals have now won
three of their last four games.
Yet, as Canfield explained, ‘We
are still looking for consistency,
to avoid mental lapses which
cause us to lose the ball. Each
game is a step toward our
potential.”’

 

Although the NCAA Division
III Swimming Championship
meet is a full two months away,
Washington and Lee University
can already count on represen-
tation in six events thanks to
fine performances turned in at
the Virginia State Champion-
ships, which took place Dec. 4-6
at the University of Virginia.

Mike Bernote, a junior from
Hampton, Va. qualified for the
NCAA Nationals in the 50, 100,
and 200-yard freestyle events.
Bernot swam the 50-yard event
in 21:88 seconds (the qualifying
standard is 21:99), swam the 100
in 47:69 seconds (qualifying is
47:99), and the 200 in 1:45.74
minutes (qualifying is 1:46.78).

Tim Rock, a freshman from
San Antonio, Texas, beat the
qualifying time in two events.
He turned in a 4:47.23 clocking
in the 500-yard freestyle event
(qualifying is 4:51.4) and a
16:17.27 time in the 1650-yard
freestyle (qualifying is
17:03.59). His mark in the 1650
was 1.2 seconds off the W&L
school record.

The sixth event in which W&L
qualified was the 400-yard
freestyle relay. Herb Gresens,
Rob Crawford, Kevin Becker,
and Bernot teamed for a 3:15.90
showing (qualifying mark is
3:16.35).

‘These performances are the
best I’ve ever had a team swim
so early in the year,’’ remarked
head coach Page Remillard.
‘‘We often shoot for the moon
and are happy to reach most
anywhere out in space. This
time we shot the moon and
reached a few stars, too.

“I’m. pleased for our swim-

mers,’ the second-year direc-
tor’ continued. ‘‘When you get
new swimmers like Rock,
Crawford, Becker, into a new
school and with a new coach,
good performances like these
show they can attain goals
quickly. As for upperclassmen
like Bernot and Gresens, it
shows they can continue to set
and attain goals.

“In addition to the qualifying
times, I’m pleased that our top
performances came from some
of our top academic swim-
mers,’’ Remillard offered,
referring to Bernot, Crawford,
and Gresens.

The State Championship
event was W&L’s final listing on
the 1980 portion of the schedule,
during which the team also
compiled a 1-1 dual meet
record. Swimming against
Richmond and VMI in the
season-opener at W&L on Nov.
19 the Generals won over VMI
78-34. while bowing to the
Spiders 76-37. Crawford, a
sophomore from Ft. Walton
Beach, Fla., provided a pair of
highlights by setting W&L
records in the 200-yard in-
dividual medley event (2:03.95
to break a 1978 mark of 2:05.10)
and in the 100-yard breaststroke
(1:03.56 to break a 1962 mark of
1:04.40).

Over the holiday break, the
Generals will travel to San An-
tonio, Texas for a series of prac-
tices. Dates for the trip are Dec.
26 through Jan. 4. W&L will
resume its regular schedule on
Jan. 9 at home against George
Washington. The NCAA meet
will be held March 19-21 at
Oberlin (Ohio) College.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Right Direction

The cliche no news is good news certainly applies to
Lexington’s current crime problem.That no student
residence burglaries were reported over the winter
break is remarkable considering last semester’s in-
crease of crime in various categories. It is interesting
to note that the vacation break-in problem seemed to
find a quick and simple solution — the action taken
against local juveniles by Judge Robert S. Culpepper.
We applaud Judge Culpepper’s efforts to curb
juvenile involvement in local crime. No doubt the
University did some effective prodding in this matter,
but Culpepper’s work in this area seems noteworthy.
When Charles Murray, alias ‘Murph’, our school
proctor, says someone makes a difference in stopping
crime, you know that person is on the ball. Murph
says Culpepper makes a difference (see ‘‘No Thefts
Over Break”’ page 1), and we thank Mr. Culpepper for
working so well on the juvenile crime problem.

But private business and initiative also seemed to
contribe to Washington and Lee’s rescue from crime.
Specifically, a local entrepeneur named James Watt
started a storage service and promised to provide
safe storage for student valuables year-round for a
nominal fee. And should anyone decide to burglarize a
house, they have to realize the consequences of facing
Judge Rudolph Bumgardner — the judge who handed
down a stiff penalty in the Phi Kappa Sigma burglary
case. We think Commonwealth’s Attorney Beverly C.
‘‘John”’ Read did a good job in prosecuting the state’s
case against the Phi Kap Prowler and Judge
Bumgardner did an excellent job of choosing a
sentence for the defendent. We hope both judges and
the prosecuting attorney keep up the good work and
put an end to the crime problem in Lexington.

Editor

 

 

Senior Pictures Explained

Dear Editor:

There is, with good reason,
some confusion among the
senior class concerning por-
traits for the CALYX. On behalf
of myself and Editors Peter
Eliades and Parker Roberts, I’d
like to clear up as much of this
confusion as possible. As of the
just-ended (and, as always, too
short) vacation, about 185
seniors had been photographed.
Many of you have justly been
curious about seeing the proofs
of your portraits. Well, this will
happen next week. Proofs will
be available for viewing in the
CALYX Office (Student Center
Room 200) from Monday,
January 12 through Thursday,
January 15, between 7:00 and
8:30 in the evenings. If you want
to purchase prints of your por-
traits, you can do so then.

About the other 100 or so of
you in the senior class who
haven’t been photographed yet:
this can still be done. I am going
to do one more week of
shooting, Monday, January 12
through Friday, January 16.

Sign yourself up in the schedul-
ing book in the co-op. There is a
$2 late fee, bringing the total
cost of your portrait to $10.
Why? Because you had all of
October, November and part of
December to get it together and
you didn’t do it. The CALYX:

staff (and myself) have other, .

things we need to be doing and
that makes this ‘make-up’ work
a hassle. So it costs you more
money since it costs us more
time.
Some of you have decided to
submit portraits of your own do-
ing or pictures shot by friends.
That’s fine, as long as the print
you turn in is in black and white’
and of sufficient quality to
reproduce satisfactorily. If this
is what you’re going to do, you
should have the print turned in
by Friday, January 16. Do this
during the proof showing hours,
since you'll need to fill out a
senior information sheet too.
Some of you seem to have the
impression that turning in your
own portrait will exempt you

from the $8 fee. Not so. Repeat:
not so. The cost is the same no
matter who does your photo.
From the standpoint of finance
(which is the reason nobody is
exempt from the $8 fee) the
CALYX will be just as happy if
you do turn in your own por-
trait, since they’ll get the $8
without having to pay me for
shooting you. And, frankly, I’ve
got enough work to do already,
so I won’t mind not
photographing any of you who
do want to submit your own
stuff. On the other hand, either
way, you’re shelling out the
bucks, so it won’t cost you any
more to have me photograph
you too...

Whatever, I’m ready when
you are. Overall, the Class of
1981 has been the most pleasant
Class of the 6 Senior Classes
I’ve photographed here, and I
thank you, Gentlemen, for your
civility and hospitality.

CenTel — hardly a Christmas
card,

With my mind zonked and my
nerves frayed I turned to the
last resort — the ABC store.
And what did I find out, only
that the damn store is being
moved down the road, effective-
ly preventing a between-classes
sprint. There is one consolation
— the new store will be larger
and self-service. But it. still
won’t have a drive-thru win-
dow, or will it?

There's no Monday night foot-
ball but there was a special 60
Minutes program. I looked on to
see Dan Rather interviewing
my father. I couldn’t watch
after they got to the part about
income tax evasion. My alma
mater was left out of this year’s
favorite stocking stuffer. I settl-
ed down to read my favorite
book — The Painted Bird.

Another day in the life.

on my desk, | came across the
telegram.’’ Of course, the tele

gram was to inform him of being

awarded the Fellowship.

Mollenhotf said the award
was a Surprise. ‘It’s the Hall of
Fame.”’ He said the honor is dif-
ferent from most of his other
(numerous) awards. This
award falls into the category of
the Eisenhower Exchange
Fellow award he received in
1960; the University of Arizona,
John Peter Zenger Award he

received in 1962; and the
University of Kansas, Allen-
White Award he received in
1964. He said the similarity lies
in that ‘‘you don’t have any idea
you are even being considered
for the award.”’ There are no
publicly announced entries or
nominations where competition
occurs and one knows what he
or she is competing for he ex-
plained. ‘‘You are tapped on the
shoulder; it’s a surprise.”’

He noted that ‘‘other awards

Johnson Discusses W&L

(continued from page 1)

available to every student at
W&L.

“It seems as if this school is
violently opposed to research,
Johnson said adding that ‘at
times, this school seems to go
out of its way to prevent a stu-
dent form doing research.”

This schortcoming of the
school, in Johnson’s opinion, in
allowing students to perform
research is a major factor in his
disenchantment. Johnson
believes, in fact, that his first
bad experience with W&L dates
back to when he was applyi for
admission to the school.

“T feel that I was lied to dur-
ing my (admissions) interview
when I asked about what frater-
nities do to a student,’’ claimed
Johnson. ‘‘All I got were glossy
answers, Still, I tried to go
through rush open-minded.”’

Johnson said that he lost all
respect for the fraternity
system early into the rush pro-
gram. “People don’t realize
that the only friends you make
in fraternities are social ones,”
stated Johnson. ‘‘The average
friend in a fraternity is ar-
tificial; he has no idea what you
have done or what you're do-
ing.”

Johnson was not entirely der-
rogatory of W&L’s social life, as
he declared that W&L “‘is the
best school I know ef to get laid.
By the end of the week everyone
is horny.”

Johnson believes, however,
that W&L has caused him to
have difficulty in working with
women. “It’s hard for me to
talk professionally to a woman
unless I’ve danced with her
first,’ claimed Johnson. “I
have never met a woman here

who has understood my
studies.”
The best solution for

Washington and Lee, Johnson
believes, is to drop the all-male
concept of enrollment and allow
women to attend the college.
Along with admitting women,
Johnson believes W&L should
increase tuition, so that more
research equipment can be pur-
chased.

“Basically, Washington and
Lee University is a boys’ high
school with nice facilities and
bright teachers’’’ said Johnson.
“But this school will never be
more than boys’ high school
unless some changes are
made.”

‘‘As far as I understand, both
the student body and the faculty
are in favor of coeducation,”’
continued Johnson, ‘‘ but the
board of trustees is against it.
All I know is that-it could be
money better spent.”’

And if he had to do it all again,
Johnson said he definitely
would not return to W&L. “I
probably would go to the Naval
Academy,’ said Johnson.
‘There are so few people here
you can talk to about physics.”

where what you’ve done on an
individual case is as much luck

Mollenhoff explained,
however, that the award is bas-
ed on the test of time and en-
durance of one’s overall
business record. It is never
given for one exceptional story.
He noted that when he began his
journalistic career, it was

Burns Warns Blacks
Of Increased Racism

Speaking on the eve of what
would have been Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.’s 52 birthday,
the regional director of the
National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People
(NAACP) warned a_ small
audience in Lee Chapel last
night that blacks in America
have the potential of becoming
like the Jews of Nazi Germany

The Rev. Dr. Emmett C.
Burns, regional director of the
NAACP in Virginia, Maryland
and the District of Columbia,
told the mostly black audience
that the United States is looking
for scapegoats and blacks may
be the ones the rest of the
country can blame for today’s
problems.

“The majority is beginning to
look for reasons why they are
doing poorly and I’m afraid
they are blaming the blacks,”
Burns said. “Just look at all the
violence and sudden conser-
vatism in this country.”’

Burns pointed to the wave of
killings in Atlanta, Georgia and
Buffalo, New York, the shooting
of National Urban League
President Vernon Jordan last
year, the increase in Ku Klux
Klan activities and the election
of Ronald Reagan as examples
of increasing hatred for blacks.

He said the majority of people
in the United States see high
taxes, busing to achieve in-
tegration and food stamps
asnothing more than  un-
necessary benefits for blacks at
the expense of white prosperity
and thus, blame the weak
economy on them.

“The future looks bleak for
blacks,” Burns said.

Burns also said he believes
the election of Ronald Reagan,
“whom we fear,’’ means less
for blacks and more for whites
in America. He said proposed
Reagan Administration policies
to aid the slumping economy
will guarantee profits for the

wealthy, maintain the status
quo and take back what blacks
have gained in the past 25
years.

‘Reagan wants to balance the
budget, cut taxes and increase
defense spending,” Burns said.
“Do you know how he’s going to
do this, by taking away what we
have gained.”

Burns’ talk, sponsored by the
Washington and Lee Student
Association for Black Unity and
the Office of Minority Affairs,
was titled “If Dr. King Were
Here—What?” But Burns, who
captivated the audience with
long quotations of poetry and
simulated dialogue with King,
turned the talk into an appeal
for black students at the univer-
sity.

“Now is the time for you,
those lucky to receive a good
education, to rise up and do
what we can for the American
system and for blacks,’’ said.
Burns.

“King died to get you here,
now don’t turn your backs on
your race. You have a
mission,’’ added Burns.

Burns said he believes racism
is “here to stay” and that the
Ku Klux Klan now spreads its
doctrine from ‘‘sea to shining
sea.”’ But he also said blacks

Midterm Reports Spur
New Review Policy

by Bill Whalen

The Executive Committee
passed a measure Monday
night which allows it to review
the financial records of student
organizations. The measure
passed, 8-2, with Senior
representatives Jim Vines and
Marshall Clark dissenting.

The E.C. brought up discus-
sion of a need for financial
review after hearing the
midterm report of the Student
Activities Board. The SAB’s
midterm report failed to list
revenues received from one of
its movies and, when question-
ed by E.C. Vice-President
Willie Mackie, SAB _ Co-
Chairmen Jamie Small and
Price Elam were unaware of
discrepancies involving SAB
accounts.

According to Mackie, the SAB
had been drawing money out of
an account which did not con-
tain any funds. The SAB has
three separate accounts with
the university. Mackie said that
another account paid for the
SAB’s expenses. Small and
Elam said they were unaware

of the empty account and at-.

tributed the mistake to an ac-
counting error.

E.C. President Bob Willis
then said the EC needs a pro-

gram through which its liason
members to student organiza-
tions can review financial
records. Willis also recom-
mended that the Publications
Board take up a similar policy.
“We give you the money,”
said Vines in response to a ques-
tion by Small, ‘‘that gives us the
right to check your books.”’
Elam responded to the E.C.’s
argument, claiming that “the

E.C. should not get involved in

checking what is being done in-
ternally in an organization.
Elam stated that the E.C. has
no right to know ‘“‘how money is
being moved around”’ within an
organization.
Willis then

listed three

 

 

EC Members Frank Smith and Jeff Edwards

reasons for the need for finan-
cial review, including: (1) that
the program allows the E.C. to
“physically look’’ at books, (2)
it allows the E.C. the opportuni-
ty to ‘see specifically the
details of expenditures.”’ (3) it
allows the E.C. ‘“‘the opportuni-
ty to protect organizations by
giving it a seal of approval.”’

Small was clearly angered by
the E.C.’s recommendation,
asking ‘“‘does anybody ever
audit you people?’ Elam voiced
a similar complaint, stating ‘‘I
don’t like anyone looking over
my shoulder.”’

The SAB also announced that
it lost over $2500 for the

Superdance Bands, Events Revealed

by Steven Perry
For the third consecutive
year, Washington and Lee
University is sponsoring a
dance marathon to benefit the
Muscular Dystophy Associa-
tion. As has been the case for
the previous two fund-raisers,
the event will take place in
Evans Dining Hall, from Feb. 6
through Feb. 8. Superdance ’81
consists of 30 hours of virtually
non-stop dancing during which
a fifteen minute break is given
every hour; and a two hour rest
between 4 and 6 on Saturday
morning. The dancers will also
receive free beer throughout
the marathon and five meals.
J.Hemby, co-chairman of
the Dancethon. for the past
three years, says the dance is
going to be better than ever.
Seven bands are scheduled to

' play at the benefit. The dance

kicks off Friday night at 8:00
with the music of Jimmy Bishop
and Turning Point. After three
hours of soul, the Good Humor
Band, a rock group, will play on
into Saturday morning. Satur-
day, after the dancers are given
breakfast, three more live
bands will be presented. From
seven until nine o’clock a
bluegrass band will entertain,

followed by two hours of Reg-
gae music performed by the
band Sunfire. Saturday after-
noon music concludes with
Steve Bassett and the Sweet
Virginia Breeze which will play
four hours of beach music.
Saturday night, the popular
rock band Tracks will play from
6 p.m. until 10 p.m. The final
live band, The Graudeurs and
Act Ill, will play from 10 p.m.
Saturday through 2 a.m. Sun-
day. In all, 22 hours of live
music will be played during the
dance marathon. The intervals
between bands will be followed
by taped music sponsored by
Playback. All seven bands are
playing at reduced rates for
M.D.

Throughout Superdance ’81,
door prizes will be given out to
the dancers. Hemby believes
that the door prizes along with
the live bands will help avoid
the monotony of 28 hours of dan-
cing. The Grand Prize for
Superdance ’81 will be awarded
to the contestant who raises the
most money for the dance
marathon, and includes a vaca-
tion for two in Key West,
Florida. Approximately every
four hours, one dancer or spec-
tator will be permitted to throw

a pie into a faculty member’s
face. This honor will go to the
highest bidder with all proceeds
going toward the Superdance
’81 goal of $20,000.

While many of the basic
features of last year’s Super-
dance remain unchanged, Hem-
by says. two areas that were
overlooked during the previous
years have received greater at-
tention. As co-chairmen of the
Superdance '81 committee,
Hemby and Tripp Brower
sought to increase the involve-
ment of the community of Lex-

ington in the dance-a-thon.
Several of the local civic groups
are donating money and spon-
soring dancers, while food is be-
ing provided by Wendy’s, Ken-
tucky Fried Chicken, Spanky’s,
and Kroger’s. The door prizes
are also being donated by local
merchants.

The Washington and Lee
faculty is also playing a larger
role in the dance-a-thon, with
lacrosse coach ‘Jack Emmer
serving as the faculty advisor of
Superdance °81. 30 secretaries

Huntley To Speak
At ODK Convocation

Robert E.R. Huntley, presi-
dent of Washington and Lee
University, will be the speaker
next Monday (Jan. 19) at the
University’s traditional
Founders’ Day convocation.

The public is invited to attend
the event which will be held at

12:30 p.m. in W&L’s Evans
Hall.
As part of the annual

Founders’ Day ceremonies, a
number of, Washington and Lee
students and prominent alumni

will be inducted into Omicron
Delta Kappa, the national honor .
society recognizing outstanding
leadership. ODK was founded
at Washington and Lee in 1914
and now has chapters on more
than 160 college and university
campuses throughout the na-
tion.

Rupert N. Latture, the sole
surviving founder of ODK and
now assistant to President
Huntley, will participate in the
ceremonies.

IFC States Role of Scholarship Chairmen

by Mike Perry

Inter-fraternity President
Monty Briscoe cautioned frater-
nity leaders last Tuesday night
against initiating freshmen who
did not achieve a 1.9 grade point
average last term.

Briscoe read from a Student
Affairs Committee report two
measures which were adopted
by the University Council and
slated to be effective this year.

The Report states:

‘1. For a student to be in-
itiated into a social fraternity at

Washington and Lee, he shall be
required to be in residence here
for at least one full 12-week
term, with a minimum
cumulative grade point average
of 1.90.

2. Each fraternity shall ap-
point Scholarship Chairmen
whose primary responsibility
shall be to promote an at-
mosphere of scholarly concern
and an environment in which
academic achievement is
respected within the chapter.

As a minimum, his duties shall
be to (a) publish a list of all in-
itiated members and their ma-
jors; (b) publish a list of all in-
itiated members and pledges at
the end of each term, and (c)
provide the Coordinator of
Fraternity Affairs, prior to
each initiation ceremony, with
a list of those persons to

be initiated.”’

Dean of Fraternity Affairs
Dan Murphy stressed to the IFC
that these resolutions were

have volunteered to tabulate
the pledges at the end of the
dance-a-thon in order to ex-
vedite the billing process.

Superdance ’81, with the ex-
ception of Coach Emmer, has
been organized by students. A
steering committee, composed
of 25 members, has been work-

ing on the dance-a-thon since

J. Hemby Muscular Dystrophy D

September. Various sub-
committees involved in organiz-
ing the benefit include the
entertainment, security, and
the liason committees. The
liason committee is a new com-
mittee which has been added to
maintain a line of communica-
tion between the steering Com-
mittee and the _ individual
representatives at the women’s
colleges.

 

 

 

ance Marathon

 

Hemby and Brower stress the
importance of participation on
a large scale by W&L students if
Superdance ’81 is going to meet
its goal of $20,000. They went on
to say that any student or Lex-
ingtonian may participate if
they are 18 or older. The
deadline for registration is
February 6th and all dancers
must have a minimum of $50 in
pledges. Hemby said ‘‘this

dance marathon is a perfect
chance to have a good time and
also benefit those who are less
fortunate, without any cost to
yourself.

Hemby believes that last
year’s net of $19,000 will be sur-
passed. He said ‘‘student
response has been much more
enthusiastic than last year, and
therefore we expect a

Hemby went on to say that all

fraternities are represented.
Each fraternity has agreed to

avoided scheduling any social
events for the Superdance ’81
weekend. As has been done for
the past two years, the Super-
dance committee will petition

- the meal plan patrons of Evans

Dining Hall in hopes that they
will donate the cost of their
Saturday night meal to Super-
dance ’81. The rest of the meals
will be unaffected by the dance
marathon.

If you have a gripe about the
Student Government, then con-
sider what they’ve done at the

University of Texas and the.

University of Virginia.

Both state schools have decid-
ed through votes of the student
bodies to abolish their student
governments. But these man-
dates are not unique, however,
as several other colleges have
made the same move in the past
two years.

Texas students originally
decided to abolish their govern-
ment in 1978 and similar actions
have taken place on the cam-
puses of the University of
Georgia, Auburn University

adopted by the UC because of
““concern about the direction
fraternities are headed with
regard to academics,”’ warned
fraternities against any at-
tempts to avoid compliance
with the SAC guidelines.

The IFC also passed a motion
calling for each house to donate
two kegs of beer to the Dance
Marathon to be held February
6-8.

The IFC Judicial Board met
to inquire into a complaint lodg-

ed by a Mary Baldwin College
student about the behavior of
members of the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity at a party held there.
Phi Delt Representative Henry
Clay explained that the frater-
nity had paid for all resulting
damages and clean up, adding
that a letter of apology had been
sent to the Dean of Students at
Mary Baldwin. The IFC Board
suggested that the Phi Delts
write another letter to the in-
dividual.

 

Dr. Bruce Herrick, head of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s economics department,
was recently appointed general
editor of a series of books on

The series is entitled ‘‘Butter-
worths Advanced Economics

with the aid of an international
group of consulting editors.

participated in the dance
marathon, and over a thousand
people watched as $24,000 was
pledged. Unfortunately, only 75
percent of the money pledged
was ever collected. Hemby
believes that the reason this
figure was so low was because
several students were not

aware of where the money was
going. Of all the money col-
lected from the Superdance,
83.5 percent of the funds went
directly to research and
medical services, while only
16.5 percent of the money was
allocated to fund raising and
management.

End Government

~

and Northern Colorado (Nor-
thern Colorado? ).

At Virginia, a record 60 per-
cent of eligible student voters
turned out to kill the Campus
Council, one of the two houses
which make up U.Va.’s student
government. One member of
the deceased council claims
that students perceive the C.C.
as “a worthless _ institution
(which) slimey politicos see as
an avenue to power and
prestige.”

Critics of U.Va.’s system
maintain that the Campus
Council served mostly as an
organization which gave money
to groups which were rejected

elsewhere. Students also claim
that the C.C. was beneficial only
to students who wanted to play
big-time politician.

According to that same coun-
cil member, the U.Va. vote is.
indicative of a “growing desire
in schools across the nation to
emphasize what universities
are for: studying and scholar-
ships - not politics.’’

Students at Texas, home of
Longhorns and _ Longnecks,
seem to have abandoned all
respect for student government
years ago. In 1977, for example,
a student won the campus
presidential election simply by
wearing a clown suit.

Library Receives Bomb Threat

8 p.m. into a service telephone
in one of the library’s two

working at the desk that night,
W&L sophomore David Marsh,
that there was a bomb on the
elevator. The caller than hung

Marsh commented that it was

The ‘Best Three’ of 1980

by John Wells

The year just past probably won't be
remembered as anyone’s greatest and the cinema
is no exception. Actually the list of real stinkers
far outweighs those films with any redeeming
features, but then this is usually the case. At any
rate, I find myself unable to come up with a “‘top
ten’’ list due to the following reasons: however you
look at it, most films really were far below the
average in quality last year; Lexington and my
own hometown tend to have limited facilities and
selection of films.

The best of the films I’ve seen in 1980:

Coal Miner’s Daughter — Sissy Spacek is
remarkable as country singer Loretta Lynn. I’ve
never been wild about Hee Haw or Opryland, but
the eloquent simplicity displayed in an evocative
visual showcase make this a truly outstanding
film. Tommy Lee Jones and particularly Beverly
d’Angelo as Patsy Cline are excellent. Sissy
Spacek appears to be a shoo-in for the best actress
Oscar.

Ordinary People — Robert Redford’s directoral
debut is distinguished by superlative perfor-
mances from the entire cast. While the folks here
are ordinary neither financially or emotionally,

the film is full of very familiar and beautifully
captured human expression. Everything about the
movie rings true, from the people to their clothes
and furniture, and its frightening to realize that
the Mary Tyler Moore part is not at all a
caricature.

The Empire Strikes Back — Technically
superior and genuinely entertaining, a bit more
sober than its predecessor. Frankly I think the
whole sci-fi thing is becoming a bit tiresome.

A thin line-up, admittedly, but it excludes
foreign films and I was unable to see Raging Bull
or My Bodyguard both of which may well have
made the list. Of course none of these would be ap-
pealing to the movie goer who considered The
Blue Lagoon and Any Which Way You Can to be
the outstanding achievements of the year past.

The biggest disappointments of 1980:

Wise Blood — Bizarre, unclear and not com-
pletely faithful to the Flannery O’Conner story,
John Huston’s latest contains some fine acting by
Brad Dourif and, briefly, Ned Beatty. O’Conner
once wrote that she was pleased when an old lady
told her that reading Wise Blood left a bad taste in
her mouth. The film version leaves a weird taste

Film Notes

Frenzy (1972) Alfred Hitchcock returned to England to film what
turned out to be his next-to-last movie about a series of bizarre
stranglings in London. It’s interesting to see how Hitch worked in a
freer, less restricted environment under a considerably more
liberal code by the Motion Picture Association of America.
Presented by the SAB Friday through Sunday, January 16-18, at 7
and 9p.m. in duPont Auditorium. Admission is $1.

The Marriage of Maria Braun (1979) One of the new German
films by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, a complete discussion of
which appears on these pages. Presented by the Film Society Fri-
day and Saturday at 8 p.m. in classroom ‘‘A”’ of Lewis Hall.

 

 

 

 

Film Society Presents Fassbinder Classic

by Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society is pleased to present as
its fourth movie of the season
Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s
The Marriage of Maria Braun
(Germany, 1978). It will be
shown Friday, January 16, and
Saturday, January 17, at 8 P.M.
in classroom ‘‘A”’ of Lewis Hall,
free of charge.

Fassbinder is the most pro-
lific and diversely gifted of the
new West German directors,
and Maria Braun is his thirty-
second film in ten years. Often
experimental to the point of
recklessness, Fassbinder here
successfully combines

melodrama, slapstick, soap
opera, the panoramic historical
sweep of an epic, and black
comedy. Other movies directed
by him which have appeared at
Washington and Lee include
Chinese Roulette (1976), shown
our first year, and Fox and His
Friends (1975), shown last year.
Maria Braun is by all
measurements his best. It is a
movie that changes one’s ideas
about what movies can do.
During World War II in Ger-
many, a man leaves his new
bride to rejoin the fighting. The
movie concerns the daring,
anti-social assertions of style
and will by which the wife,

Maria Braun, survives the war
and makes her way up in Ger-
man society after receiving the
news that her husband is dead.
Her resourceful struggle to sur-
vive and her compromising suc-
cess coincide with and com-
ment upon the German
“economic miracle,’’ the post-
war period of recovery and
revitalization.

Morally explosive, Maria
Braun retains an unassailable
moral purity. Yet this purity
ultimately clarifies as a form of
coldness and, at the end, when
she and her husband are
reunited, they can hardly feel
anything. Most of all, Maria

desires still to control her
destiny, suddenly revealed to be
beyond her arrangement. The
film ends as it began, with an
explosion, which perhaps
foreshadows a political disaster
only different in kind from that
of the Hitler years.
Fassbinder’s admiration for
the energy of his heroine
(played with vulnerable
toughness by Hanna Schygulla)
leads him, despite reservations,
to charge the comic esprit of her
social ascent, and its volup-
tuous rigor, with the full play of
his technical inventiveness. The
camera work is elegent and wit-
ty in an almost literary way. In

one remarkable scene, we see

‘tobacco leaves at the end of a

cigarette in a close-up so huge
that they become more real and
beautiful than we ever imagin-
ed so ordinary a reality could
be. Fassbinder himself appears
in the film as a peddler.

The Film Society’s next
movie is Eric Rohmer’s com-
edy Claire’s Knee (France,
1970), scheduled for Friday,
February 6, and Saturday,
February 7. The three movies to
be shown after that will be
selected at a meeting of the
Film Society open to all
members and scheduled for
Thursday, January 29, at 7:30
P.M. in Payne 3.
 

 

A Guide to
_ The Blues

by Robin C. Meredith

One of the few things most theoretically-minded critics can agree
upon is the standard doctrine that rock’n’roll began as an
amalgamation of various elements of urban blues, country, and
jazz. Indeed, listening to records as diverse as the old big band
classic In The Mood, Hank Williams’ Move it on Over, and any
number of early Chicago blues numbers, it’s easy to imagine a
young Chuck Berry or Elvis Presley growing up hearing all these
things on the radio and piecing together a unique vision of popular
music that set the stage for all modern rock’n’roll.

The funny thing is, once rock’n’roll established itself as
(arguably) the most important development in the history of
American popular music, three things happened: 1) jazz shifted
radically to the left through the experimental work of John Col-
trane and Ornette Coleman 2) country music continued on its reac-
tionary, purist path throughout the ’60’s (remember, Dolly Parton
was ostracized for adding strings to her records in 1963 (3) the blues
entered into a holding pattern of sorts — every little blues work of
any great import was done during the ’60’s.

In the early ’70’s, however, a blues revival began which has con-
tinued sporadically since then. The old forms were still there, to be
sure, but the bluesmen of the early ’70’s showed-that they had been
listening to, and had learned from, what the Rolling Stones, the
Yardbirds, Jimi Hendrix, and others had done to widen the boun-
daries of blues playing.

Over the years, rock has had a significant, but largely pernicious,
influence on jazz. So-called ‘‘jazz-rock fusion’’ degenerated into
formulaic crap faster than any trend in recent memory. Country
has also changed over the past five years to the point where the
distinction between pop and country in many cases appears ar-
bitrary. But the whole ‘‘crossover syndrome’’ represents little
more than a search for bigger bucks and wider acceptance by a few
artists.

In contrast, blues and rock have consistently reinforced each
other in a positive fashion. Blues are everywhere, in one per-
mutated form or another, from Dire Straits to Steve Forbert to Pat
Travers. Also, thanks to bands like the Nighthawks, Allstars, Cat-
fish Hodge, and others, blues are gaining an increasing amount of
acceptance among rock fans at a grassroots level. -

There is one big problem here. As Amy O'Neal pointed out in a re-
cent issue of Living Blues, a rather fanatical Chicago-based blues
publication, most of the folks who go nuts over blues in live perfor-
mance would never think of going home and buying a blues record.
One reason for this is that blues record-hunting is anything but
easy; lousy production, misguided management, record company
deletion policies, and the fact that most stores just don’t stock the
damn things are only a few of the obstacles the rookie blues hound
must surmount. So, for those of you who might be interested in
making the jump from barroom blues to turntable blues, here is my
own five-step beginners’ guide to the blues:

1) The Nighthawks — Open All Nite — This record comes first,
not because it contains any truly definitive performances, but
rather because of the encyclopedic song selection. Muddy Waters,
Sonny Boy Williamson, Elmore James, Jimmy Reed and Junior
Parker are all represented by their best numbers, performed in a
style that should go down quite well with most rock-oriented ears.

2) Albert Collins — Ice Pickin’ and Frostbite.

3) Fenton Robinson — Somebody Loan Me A Dime and I Hear
Some Blues Downstairs.

4) Son Seals — Live & Burning, and Chicago Fire — All three of
these guys are black, young (when it comes to black bluesmen,
anything under 50 is positively juvenile), Texas-born guitarists. In
fact, they’re all hot guitarists, each in his own way, Seals being the
most fiery and rock-influenced, Collins the funkiest and most in-
novative, and Robinson the must traditional and refined. These are
all excellent modern blues records, solidly produced, featuring
mostly original material. (See GUIDE, p. 8)

Natural Bridge consists of
five musicians: Greg Karukas,

The group plays its own com-

Washington-area critics have
had a generally favorable reac-

rich in musical detail. The

This

shown in his talent and career.
Margolin played and recorded
with Muddy Waters for seven
years as Waters’ lead guitarist
and chief associate. Before this
period ended in 1980 Margolin
appeared on six Muddy Waters
albums. Four of these,
Woodstock Album, Hard Again,

Mississippi Waters Live won
Grammy Awards. Margolin
even played bass guitar on I’m

The Todd Hobin Band (Jan. 17
in the Cockpit), has matured in-
to a powerful, straight-ahead
group of rock and rollers,
without losing the intimate ap-
proach to performing that has
earned them a loyal following
all along the east coast. Todd
has refined a dynamic and in-
tense brand of rock and roll,
while retaining the unique, per-
sonal style of writing and play-
ing that has consistently im-
pressed audiences and critics
quickly developed into upstate
New York’s favorite. After
several radio broadcasts
brought their music to mass au-
diences, Todd Hobin became a
top telephone request on many ~
stations. Their first album, en-
titled The Todd Hobin Band,
followed shortly. It almost im-
mediately sold out, by word of
mouth and strong airplay.
Featuring New York Country
Sons and I Hate You, the album

formances, Variety declared
that this ‘First rate rock com-
bo...is most impressive.’ In
Buffalo, the Courier Express

The Hype

by Ralph Frasca

Oakland and Philadelphia.
Philadelphia and Oakland. Jim
Plunkett’s “amazing’’ come-
back. Wilbert Montgomery’s
knee. Dan Pastorini’s possible
retirement. Dick Vermeil’s
“rah-rah”’ coaching methods.
Harold Carmichael’s favorite
color. Whether the heartbreak
of psoriasis will be a major fac-
tor in the final score.

Who really cares?

Unless you’ve just returned
from a stint as a Tibetan Monk,
you're aware of the celebrated
participants in the annual
Pigskin Parade who, in little
more than a week, will be par-
ticipating in what may be the
most relentlessly hyped event
in sports.

A week from Sunday NBC, in
their unmistakable Proud-as-a-
Peacock style, will bring us the
game in living color. Unfor-
tunately, the game is to be
preceded by hours of inane pre-
game chatter, in which a broad-
caster who sounds like he’s on
uppers, a few dumb ex-jocks,
and a woman whose knowledge
of sports would fit on an insignia
ring, will try to tell us what
we'll see, based on their self-
proclaimed ‘‘expertise.’’ The
appalling thing about these
odious pre-game assaults on our
intelligence is the sheer worth-
lessness of the information. By
telling us about who pulled what
muscle, by telling us the heart-
warming story of how some
player’s mother is suffering
from a hangnail and how the
athlete vows to ‘win it for
Mom,” and by burdening us
with reams of meaningless
statistics, these incessantly
jovial broadcast types and
“color analysts’ (who neither
analyze very well nor are the

least bit colorful) are attemp-
ting to arm us for the epic
gladiatorial struggle we are for-
tunate enough to witness. Per-
sonally, I’d just rather watch
the game.

Ah, but wait! There are still
more dullards who would have
a crack at plain old football
fans. This seedy lot is known as
the media, which includes jour-
nalists, ad men, and promoters
among its chief offenders. They
would have us caught up in the
“drama” of it all, much in the
same way as alarming numbers
of bored housewives involve
themselves in someone else’s
problems by watching soap
operas. For these individuals,
the entire game boils down to
‘Them Against Us,”’ ‘The Good
Guys Versus the Bad Guys,’ and
“The Joy of Victory and the
Agony of Defeat.’’ These bas-
tions of mediocrity imply that
there is some hidden moral in-
volved in the proceedings, as in
Grimm’s Fairy Tales.

Please don’t get me wrong.
I’m a dyed-in-the-wool football
fan whose eyes will be glued to
the set next Sunday, just like
everyone else, but my objection
regards the silly hype with
which we are bombarded, the
endless sea of meaningless
refuse which we must wade
through in order to watch the
Super Bowl. Vague moral im-
plications and _ worthless
analysis (’’Gee, Pat, I believe
that the team which can get the
ball into the endzone most often
is almost sure to win’’) are
nothing more than a conspiracy
to lull this nation into a state of
numbed listlessness.

One last thing — I pick
Philadelphia to win, 30-24.

 

Cagers Whip Hampden-Sydney,

Win W&L Invitational

by Dale Park

With the ‘‘Unknown Fans hex-
ing the Hampden-Sidney Tigers
into a 33 percent free throw
shooting performance, the
Washington and Lee varsity
basketball team rolled to an
82-59 victory over the Tigers
Tuesday night at Warner
Center.

The victory avenged W&L’s
57-55 loss to H-SC earlier this
season and improved the
Generals’ ODAC record to 1-1.
The Generals are now 9-3
overall.

‘“The Unknown Fans’”’ did a
great job and the crowd was ter-

rific,’”’ commented 17th year
head coach Verne Canfield, who
saw his team overcome a poor
first-half peformance to rout
Sydney. ‘‘In the first half we

tried to overpower H-SC,”’ said
Canfield, “‘but this team cannot
overpower anyone. We _ just
calmed down and played our

 

 

game in the second half - and
gradually built up a lead.”’

Although the Generals shot
only 42 percent from the field in
the first half (compared with
Sydney’s 65 percent), W&L held
a slim 33-30 halftime advan-
tage. But in the second half, the
H-SC shooting cooled off and a
tough W&L defense kept the
Tigers from moving the ball in-
side.

Noted Canfield: ‘‘We switch-
ed team defenses - first a
halfcourt trap, then going with
a team man-to-man, and kept
them guessing.’’

At 12:35 in the second half,
senior co-captain Carby Hoy hit
a jumper to give W&L a 37-34
lead. Hoy’s basket sparked a
nine-minute period in which the
Generals outscored H-SC, 20-6.
The W&L’s shooting had heated
up to 61 percent while Sydney
had fallen to 37 percent.

Leading the W&L effort was

Guard George Spears in action for the Generals

senior center Rob Smitherman.
Smitherman scored a game-
high 19 points and grabbed
seven rebounds. Hoy followed
with 14 points, while sophomore
forward Brian Hanson and
junior guard George Spears
scored 11 and 10 points, respec-
tively.

Canfield explained that “‘this
game gives us the momentum
we wanted as we enter our
ODAC schedule. Canfield also
claimed that this year, his team
has played ‘“‘one of the toughest
pre-ODAC schedules ever.”’

This past weekend, W&L fac-
ed two tough non-ODAC teams
in the 12th annual Washington
and. Lee Invitational Tourna-
ment.

The Generals claimed the ti-
tle with convincing wins over
St. Andrews College (79-72) in
the first round and Davis &
Elkins (68-52) in the champion-
ship game. _

Against St. Andrews, every
member of the W&L “‘blue’’, or
starting five, squad scored in
double figures. Hoy led his team
with a game-high 20 points,
while Spears scored 16. Both
Smitherman and Hanson con-
tributed 10 points apiece and
senior co-captain R.J. Scaggs
netted 12.

In the championship game, _
W&L committed few fouls and
turnovers as Hoy again led his
team, this time with 16 points.
Smitherman scored 15 points,
followed by Spears, who added
10.

In addition, junior guard
Clark New, the team’s sixth
man, contributed 12 points from
the bench as W&L coasted to the
victory.

Both Hoy and Smitherman
were named to the five-man All-
Tournament team.

‘“‘We have won all but one of
our home games,’’ remarked
Canfield,”’ and that is very im-
portant because the next few
teams we will be facing at home
want to beat us very bad.”

Three Wrestlers Quit ,W&L Loses Tournament

by John Harrison

It is not an insignificant oc-
currence when three members
of the same athletic team leave
their team. Such an action will
inevitably affect the rest of the
team, whether it causes resent-
ment, bitterness or even indif-
ference. Another effect is that
the team’s expectations will
undergo serious alteration for
the remainder of the season.

Such is the case with the W&L
wrestling team. Since Friday,
sophomore Barry Thompson,
junior Elbert Umila, and junior
co-captain Mike McFadden
have notified coach Gary
Franke that they have decided
to quit the team.

What makes this situation so

different from other cases of
W&L athletes leaving a team,
especially in mid-season, is the
feeling of uneasiness which per-
vades. The problem not only in-
volves the fact that the team is
seriously short-handed; a ma-
jor cause of concern is_ the
reasons which led the three

wrestlers to depart.

The decisive factor for Umila
and Thompson was a question
of academics. Franke com-
mented, ‘‘Neither were
satisfied with their grades and
thus they felt it would be best to
quit.”’ Franke added this about
Thompson: ‘After playing for
the football team, I don’t
believe that he was ready to

give the necessary time and

energy to a second sport. In
other words, he felt that one
sport was enough for him.”’

As for McFadden, his deci-
sion was prompted by a recurr-
ing knee injury. The general
consensus was that he would be
able to return after the
Christmas break, but it was
after he defeated freshman Tim
Valliere in a match to deter-
mine who would start in the 158-
pound class that he decided to
pack it in. McFadden said that
he had thought it over before
Christmas and decided that. it
wouldn’t be worth risking
another knee injury.

According to several team-
mates, the feelings between

McFadden and Franke were
strained and testy. Their
philosophies about how the

practices should be run and how
the team should be treated were
not compatible. One source
stated that coach Franke said
McFadden “‘couldn’t suck it up.
He was cowardly, and worried-
too much about pain.”’

How does Franke feel about
losing three important
wrestlers? ‘‘As a Division III
university which does not offer
athletic scholarships, a player
is free to leave the team at any
time. Because we recieve very
little publicity outside of the
school, it takes guts for a stu-
dent to come out for a sport.

Therefore, I really don’t think
this quitting business is that big
a deal.”
As a result of being short-
handed, the Generals forfeited
three weight classes to Duke
and two to Campbell College in
last Saturday’s meet in Warner
Center. In the matches which
did take place, Duke outclassed
both of its opponents. Campbell
needed the aforementioned
forfeits to defeat W&L 32-20.
Strong performances were
turned in by freshmen Tim
Valliere and Scott Mason.

W&L’s next match will take

place this Saturday in
Charleston, South Carolina
against the Citadel.
Life of a Wrestler

by Scott Mason

Editor’s Scott
Mason is a freshman wrestler at
WEL.

At precisely 3:45 every day a
group of about twelve young
men assemble for approximate-
ly two hours in a_ small,
rectangular-sized room. When
they come out their shirts are
drenched with sweat, their
arms ache, their legs feel like
lead, and, in general, they are
drained of all physical energy.
The room is 114 on the fourth
level of the Doremus Gym-
nasium, and the 12 young men
are Washington and Lee
wrestlers.

Many people do not enjoy
watching a wrestling match,
finding it dull, boring, and often
ridiculous. However, the thing
which seems to move the spec-
tator is the ‘“‘blood and guts”
element of the sport. Several
times I have seen the mouth of a
fan gape in astonishment as he
watches two opponents battle
with intensity. Spectators
marvel as both wrestlers ex-
haust every muscle in their
body until it seems as if neither
is able to stand, yet somehow
seem to reach down deep inside
and literally crawl back onto
the mat. Wrestlers are often
asked why they have such a
desire to punish themselves.
Perhaps the answer lies outside
the action taking place on the
mat.

The life of a wrestler is by no
means glamorous and I’m sure

Sports note:

that all wrestlers have, at one
time or another, wondered why
they chose to put themselves
through the tortures of wrestl-
ing. Aside from the physically
gruelling aspects of the sport,
wrestlers must sacrifice vast
amounts of time, starve
themselves in order to make
their designated weight class,
and inevitably experience the
nauseousness and butterflies in
the pit of the stomach just
before a match. Yet that which
almost always triumphs over
the pain and suffering of a
wrestler is the keen sense of
pride and determination which
binds a team together, and
which makes an_ individual
“‘suck it up”’ and go for more. It
is this same pride which
Washington and Lee coach
Gary Franke has often spoken
of during a typical rigorous
practice when he implores his
wrestlers to “‘take pride in what
you’re doing.”

The 1981 Generals may not be
a powerhouse or even a league
threat, but maybe winning is
not really what it’s all about.
Perhaps there is another type of
“winning” which manifests
itself in a wrestler’s ability to
overcome the sacrifices which
wrestling demands and to know
just how big a heart he really
has.

Whether the season is marked
by success or failure, one must
look beyond the mere team
record and understand the real
meaning of wrestling.

Smitherman Develops Into

The Generals’ Big Man

by Ed Gonsalves

It may have been a long road
to travel, but Rob Smitherman
has arrived as a_ basketball
player.

A 6-7, 195-pound center for
Washington
Generals, he has progressed
from a self-acknowledged in-
ferior high school player to
peer- and coach-acknowledged
superior small college standout.
The three-year letterman and
‘wo -year W&L starter has
yecome one of the top big men
around.

“Overall, in high school I was
lousy,” begins the Mt. Jackson,
Va. product on the transition. “I
never really added anything of-
fensively to the game because I

was primarily a _ defensive
player. Since coming to W&L, I
feel I’ve improved physically
and matured as a ballplayer.”’

He began his W&L playing
days as a reserve center,
averaging 5.5 points and 4.7 re-
bounds as a freshman who did
manage to see action in all 28
contests. Having earned a star-
ting position as a sophomore, he
responded with 7.2 points and
6.0 rebounds per game. Last
winter the constantly improv-.
ing athlete poured in 11.1 points
and pulled down 7 rebounds per
contest, blocked 43 shots, and
led W&L in rebounding in 13 of
29 games.

‘When Rob came here four
years ago, he was timid and

   
  
 

  
    

    

NRE tintin

 

  

shy, afraid of contact,’ ex-
plains W&L head coach Verne
Canfield. ‘‘Now he has con-
fidence in himself as an in-
dividual and as a basketball
player.

“‘He’s developed a nice shot
for a big man and has become
an outstanding defensive
center,’ the Generals’ 17th-
year coach continues. ‘‘He does
an excellent job of what we call
‘helping’ by constantly backing
up everybody on the court.
“He's definitely the best big
man in our conference.”’

Smitherman came to W&L
primarily to play basketball.

“I came knowing that I would
get a chance to play within a
couple of years,’’ he offers, ad-
ding that “if I wanted to go to
school strictly for academics, I
would have gone to a state col-
lege.”’

Academics, however, have
also become part of Smither-
man’s forte. A history major, he
holds a prestigious Robert E.
Lee Scholarship and a plus-3.00
grade point average. The 1977
Stonewall Jackson Academy
graduate also participated in a
foreign study program, travel-
ling to Germany following his
junior season on the basketball
court.

     
   
    

dividual medley (2:04.71) and
200 backstroke (2:05.49),
registering victories both
times. Coach Remillard praised
the freshman’s rapid progress
this year. “Jeff is already
becoming a great swimmer. |
expect him to qualify for the
Nationals in two or three events
before long.’’

Co-captain Herb Gresens was
instrumental in the 400-meter
free-style relay victory and the
fine time in the 400 medley
relay.

All-American Mike Bernot,
freshman Tim Rock, and junior

Rob Crawford also posted:

outstanding times. Bernot cap-
tured the top prize in his two
specialty events — the 100 and
200 free-style. Rock also won
twice, in the 590 and 1000 free.
Crawford, a man of diversified
talents, finished first in the 200
breaststroke and second in the

1000 free and 200 individual
medley.

These outstanding
achievements were capped off
by a surprising effort from
freshman diver’ Richard
Rosser. Rosser placed first in
the three-meter diving and se-
cond in the one-meter diving.

Coach Remillard expects that
the great times turned in
against George Washington will
move the General swimmers
higher in the NCAA Division III
rankings. As of Jan. 7, Bernot
claimed the best time in the 200

free and second best in the 50
and 100 free. Rock was first in
the 500 free and second in the
1000 free event.

The swimmers face tough
Division I competition this
weekend away at James
Madison and Towson State.
They will return home Jan. 24
against Shepherd College.

‘Bus Boys’ Billboard Review

THE BUS BOYS—"‘Minimum
Wage Rock’n Roll,” Arista
AB4280.

(“I bet you never heard
music like this by spades.’’) So
sings Brian O'Neal on the Bus
Boys’ debut album. The only
problem with this is that he fails
to say rock'n'roll this fresh and
witty is made by few people of
any color.

The hard rocking “Dr.
Doctor’’ is an inviting opening
to the primarily black group’s
intoxicating meshing of styles.
Punctuated by an_ infectious
guitar riff, the song shows the
Bus Boys’ musical chops are up
to snuff.

It’s not until ‘Minimum
Wage’ though that the lyrical
talents of brothers Brian and
Kevin O’Neal—lead
vocalist/keyboards player and
lead
respectively— came to the
forefront. (‘How can I find
peace of mind/I’m not even liv-
ing on my own time/When
something's done wrong, what
can I say?/Someone could send
me back home today.’’)
Though performed in a
humorous, tongue firmly in
cheek manner, as is all the
album, the song touches on the

vocalist/bassist —

insecurities of contemporary
working class living. A sizzling
guitar solo by Victor Johnson
accentuates the track.

In “Did You See Me?’’ the
band mixes a_ stereotypical
black situation with one that is
atypical. Brian O'Neal plays a
“Shoe shine boy” who gets into
the new wave scene. That this
is danceable makes it even
more worthwhile.

Turning life inside out is the
Bus Boys’ speciality. In ‘There
Goes The Neighborhood,” a
black man is upset that whites
are moving into his area. (‘‘I
ain’t moving out for no Carol
and Bob/The inner city is too
close to my job,’’) complains
Brian O’Neal in one of the
album’s stellar cuts.

“Johnny Soul’d Out,” the
stand-out live track, loses
something in translation onto
vinyl. This 1950’s styled rocker
clicks in conjunction with the
onstage antics of the band.
Here, it is rather routine.

All is forgiven though on
“KKK,” which says more in its
short 1:41 minutes than most
songs three times its length.
Beginning with the recitation of
the Pledge of Allegiance over a
breakneck rock beat, it moves

into Kevin O'Neal's lament that
his skin color shouldn't hinder
him from joining that “all
American” organization, the
Klan.

On side two, ‘‘Anggie’’ is one
of the most rewarding cuts
musically. Here, Steve Felix’s
pounding drums serve to rein-
force the dynamics of the song.
Lyrically, this is a standard
boy-needs-girl plea.

Nuclear disaster is the focal
point of “‘D-Day.’’ Spearheaded
by the funky synthesizer work
of Michael Jones, the realities
of that modern day Franken
stein are shoved into the
listener’s face.

The trials of being working
class are explored again in ‘‘We
Stand United.’’ Set over a rock-
disco rhythm, Brian plays a
cocky guy who doesn’t know
what he wants but knows what
he doesn’t want. (‘Don’t want
to be no office boy/No
lightweight actors standup
toy,’’) he asserts.

The album ends with the
rock'n'roll gem _ ‘‘Respect.”’
While the lyrics may not be
suitable for some, the song con-
veys the Bus Boy’s disrespect
for boundaries of any kind.

The Todd Hobin Band

(continued from page 5)

was critically acclaimed.

The record’s success resulted
in a major break. The band was
selected to perform in the
Eastern conference of the Na-
tional Entertainment and Cam-
pus Activities Association
(NECAA) showcase. This led to
an invitation to perform on the
Mainstage showcase of the
NECAA in Washington D.C. The
NECAA conferences’ are
organized conventions that give
college programmers the op-
portunity to check out various
acts for potential booking.
Previous performers include
Linda Ronstadt, Boz Scaggs,
Chicago, and Earth Wind and
Fire.

The Todd Hobin Band is Todd
Hobin on guitar and keyboards,
Desi Desnoyers on bass, Bruce
Fowler on guitar, Shawn Hobin
on drums and Doug Moncrief on
guitar and keyboards. All con-
tribute superb vocals in addi-
tion to talented instrumentals.
The band’s distinct brand of
hard-driving yet personal
rock’n roll attests to their
fraternal as well as musical
tightness.

After 5 years of successful
performances, Todd’s . music
has evolved. Powerful and
melodic rockers, the band’s
style is vocal and tasty, yet

lacks nothing in dynamic rock’n.

roll. The band’s new album
Passion and the Pain, is the
perfect example of the polished,

the band’s transformation into

both produced by Johnny
Winter. Rolling Stone credits
these albums and Waters with a
revival of the blues. Obviously
much of this credit belongs also
to Margolin as Waters’ right
hand man.

While most of Bob Margolin’s
playing has been with Muddy
Waters he has recorded with
several other blues artists such
as the Nighthawks, Johnny
Winter, and Big Joe Duskin.

Do not think that Chicago
blues is all Bob Margolin can
play. He has also joined rock
and roll stars The Rolling
Stones, the Allman Brothers,
Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, and
Bob Dylan. With this
background some may question
Margolin’s style, but the
prevailing influence has been
that of Muddy Waters. Bob
Margolin brings his unique
touch to blues and to rock and
roll. His talent is remarkable in
both kinds of music.

The Blues

(continued from page 5)

5) B.B. King — Live at the Regal — This 1964 classic takes us as
far back as we will go this time. This is slick stuff, very urban, horn
rather than guitar-based, possibly the best example of the work of
the most popular, individual, and, in some spheres, influential

bluesmen of the past twenty years.

We stop at 1964 simply because most records made before that
time suffer from primitive production (don’t forget, Chess Records
never made much money, and their Chicago studios were far from

Sharman Qn Politics

by Jack Sharman

The umbilical cord of the New Year has been duly cut, most of the
drunks have sobered somewhat and returned to rewarding profes-
sions or stimulating academia, and President Carter winds down
his benumbing incumbency with all the grace of Arlo Guthrie at a
Shriners’ Convention. The Coming year may harbor more glad
tidings than the preceding one, and the actions of the President-
elect encourage hope, although the media have attempted to belit-
tle the incoming crew by focusing attention on everything from
Nancy’s haste to move into the White House to the simian Publick’s
disinclination to wear the semiformal attire that Reagan has called
for at the Inaugration, although such disinclination may be
justified, since stuffing the average Senator, staff member, party
leader, or socialite into civilized clothing is like unto putting a can
of Diet Dr. Pepper in a Chivas Regal sack.

But, lest we forget where we came from, as the Rastafarians and
the Ku Klux Klan are fond of saying, let us recall what took place in
1980.

Iraq and Iran, two of the globe’s more enlightened states, had
great pity on the rest of the world and started a war between
themselves, and the Soviet Union, ever caught up in the spirit of
Helsinki, invaded Afghanistan, an action wholly justified since the
Afghan military-industrial complex constitutes a no doubt grave
threat to Soviet security. In Miami, citizens played the fun family
game of ‘‘Race Riot,’’ and Yankee ingenuity held fast in the deserts
of Iran when an attempt to recue the hostages failed.

The year 1980 also gave us John Anderson, Presidential can-
didate, puerile reformer, and heir to the inter-twined myths of
Merlin and the Brothers Grimm. Teddy Ken-
nedy...uh...ah...uh...eeh...never mind. And there were, of course,

It’s My Turn — The new Jill Clayburgh picture

Among the worst of 1980:

the cast and the $40-million budget could’ve pro-
duced something much better in more competent
hands. Malcolm McDowell, Peter O’Toole and
John Gielguld all have a good scene or two, but
they’re strung together by hours and hours of
rape, sodomy, penectomies, disembowelments
and sex and sex and sex and sex and it ain’t free!

albeit one had to pay higher prices for beer, refrigerator, and elec-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Three Sides

It seems there are three sides to every story in
which a conflict occurs. In the instance of our less
than gracious Rhodes Scholar, we have Bill Whalen’s
story which contains some outrageous comments Ed
Johnson made. Then we have Ed Johnson’s rebuttal
and accusation that in some places Whalen
‘paraphrased’ and and sanctioned the paraphrased
comments with quotation marks. The truth, or third
side to every story, probably lies somewhere between
Whalen’s story and Johnson’s rebuttal, but much
closer to the original story written by Whalen.

Whalen was nice enough not to add another com-
ment Johnson made. ‘I don’t care what you print,
I'm leaving this place Friday,” said Johnson.

Reflecting on Johnson’s scholarship and remarks, I
can't help but think he certainly is not Rhodes
Scholarship material. Chip Nunley, who recently won
an NCAA scholarship, is Rhodes Scholar material;
Jeff Edwards, third-year law representative to the
Executive Committee, is Rhodes Scholarship
material. But Ed Johnson seems to lack the special
quality that makes someone fit the Rhodes mold. The
Phi regrets the article did not come off as a piece of
‘fluff’ praising Washington and Lee. Yet I’m even
more sorry that Mr.Johnson has not found the liberal
arts education at W&L—I can’t think of a better place
to learn. I believe our school is one of the few bastions
of “liberal education”’ existing today and anyone who
has learned anything in four years here should have
the education to realize it.

Change

vear Editor:

Our state legislature is once
again ready to pass a law which
will greatly affect our rights
and social activities. The
General Laws committee of the
House of Delegates in Rich-
mond will soon decide if a bill to
change the drinking age from 18
to 19 will be reported to the floor
of the House of Delegates.

This legislation is being in-
troduced because of high school

' students’ drinking activities in

northern Virginia. It appears
that 18-year-old Seniors are
buying beer and distributing it
to their younger contem-
poraries in and about the high
school grounds. Because of this
the high school authorities have
pressured certain special in-
terest groups into backing the
proposed law change.

This bill will be defeated only
if you make your voice heard by
contacting ‘your represen-
tatives, passing petitions, and
or sending a delegation from
your school to Richmond and
appear before the General
Laws committee.

We hope you will join in our
effort to stop this unjust pro-
posal.

Senior Questions EC

Role In Honor Hearings

‘lo the Executive Committee:

I am not writing this letter in response to any specific recent
event, but simply to share some thoughts regarding the administra-
tion of our honor system by you gentlemen. Recent discussions with
a former member of your committee and a rather unpleasant past
experience with the workings of the honor hearings have led me to
have some fear of the fact that inan honor hearing members of the
executive committee must serve not only as judges, but as jury,
and most importantly, prosecutor as well. Ideally, an honor hear-
ing is conducted to bring out the facts regarding any accusation of
an honor violation. Yet. in bringing out these facts in your question-
ing it is at times unavoidable that you must slip into the role of pro-
secutor. That is, you must assume guilt on the part of the accused.
It would seem to me that the only way you can evaluate the truth of
some testimony is to consider the possible falsity of that testimony
and thus guilt on the part of the accused.

My question to you then is simple. With this past term behind you,
have you in any of your deliberations come to believe the accused to
be guilty because you became wrapped up in your role as pro-
secutor? Have you at any time thought to youself, ‘I’ve got you
now.” or heard one of your fellows say: ‘‘We're going to nail this
guy.’’ (It has happened)? This is no doubt difficult to avoid at
times and I ask this question more to point out that it can occur
rather than to condemn its possible occurrence.

You gentlemen are entrusted with a considerable responsibility,
you are elected, yet your deliberations are secret and you can give
but one punishment. I hope this letter might in some way help you
with that responsibility.

Ubermann

Dear Editors:

I have only known him as
Maxwell The Pseudo-Overman.
Now I know his identity, his
name is Ed Johnson. Maxwell
has been playing around with
his billig rd ball models for far
too long. An education is not
somethi: g that one finds, but is
somethi:.z that one acquires
through ‘vork. The purpose of
Washing on and Lee is to help
the student acquire that educa-
tion, and that is why we are
known as a “teaching college,”
as opposed to a “research col-
lege.”

I must admit, however, that
Maxwell will make a good Zim-
babwe scholar. He seems to
possess a Steel-trap logical
mind, and is apparently free
from all sexual and emotional
hang-ups, but then again, these
are the attributes of any Uber-
mann right Maxwell?

Responds

Dear Editor:

I am saddened by last week’s
Phi article and its air of rancor
about W&L. At the time, I was
not sure of the relevance of my
opinions on social and academic
life here — but I tried to answer
the reporter’s questions honest-
ly. Unfortunately, many of my
ideas were paraphrased and
many of these approximations
were sanctioned by quotation
marks. This created an impres-
sion of bitterness I certainly do
not feel.

To be sure, | feel very real
concerns about these aspects of
the University. However, I did
choose to stay here for four
years and my concerns should
be viewed in this context. Also,
my disillusion stems from com-
paring W&L with an imaginary
ideal school; one which may not
exist in this less than perfect
world. My suggestions were
meant constructively, to help us
achieve this ideal. Finally, the
Physics Department and other
faculty members’ have
dedicated ‘ an emormous
amount of time to special pro-
jects of great value to my in-
tellectual development. I am
deeply grateful for their efforts.

Our Rhodes Scholar:
Laughs And Goose Calls

Dear Editor:

Upon sitting down to dinner last Thursday night, I
overheard laughs and goose calls from my frater-
nity brothers. Looking over, I saw that they were
reading the Ring-tum Phi and that the noise was a
result of the article written about our new Rhodes
Scholar, Ed Johnson, who sits in his research
room in the bottom floor of Parmly Hall. Upon
reading the story myself, I was ashamed of my
brothers’ cruelty. I realized that it was due to their
ignorance of Cecil John Rhodes’ intentions for the
scholarship’s use. I will now enlighten them to
what Rhodes wanted, and I believe that once they
understand what makes a Rhodes Scholar, they
will certainly see that Mr. Johnson is a worthy
recipient.

In Rhodes’ will (found in the Encyclopedia
Britannica, Vol. 19), he gave his intentions in this
way: “my desire being that students who shall be
elected to the scholarships shall not be merely
bookworms, I direct that in the election of a stu-
dent to a scholarship, regard shall be had for (1)
his literary and scholastic attainments; (2) his
fondness for and success in manly outdoor sports.

(3) his qualities of manhood, truth, courage,
devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of
the weak, kindliness, unselfishness and
fellowship; and (4) his exhibition during school
days of moral force of character, and of instincts
to lead and to take an interest in his schoolmates,
for those latter attributes will be likely in after life
to guide him to esteem the performance of public
duties as his highest aim.”’

I shall now try to show, using quotes from the
original article, that Mr. Johnson most adequately
fulfills these requirements.

Mr. Johnson shows literary attainment: “I was
taken in by the liberal arts bulls--t.’’“‘I’m not sure
if I am a confident student or if I am even
literate.’’ Showing both literary attainment and
his qualities of manhood, he says, ‘‘(W&L) is the
best school I know to get laid.’’(Can you picture it?
Washington Hall getting laid? ). ‘‘By the end of the
week everyone is horny.’ His qualities of
manhood are also shown in the statement, ‘“W&L
has caused him to have difficulty in working with
women.”

His success in manly outdoor sports is summed
up by this inspired quote: ‘‘I tried to go through
rush open minded.”

Interest in schoolmates: ‘‘The average friend in
a fraternity is artificial; he has no idea what you
have done or what you’re doing.”’

Courage: ‘‘It’s hard for me to talk professional-
ly toa woman unless I’ve danced with her first.”

Unselfishness: ‘‘W&L should increase tuition so
that more research equipment can be purchased.”

Instincts to lead and take interest in
schoolmates: “‘There are so few people here you
can talk to about physics.”’

And last, but not the least, devotion to duty:
“Johnson said he definitely would not return to
W&L.”’

I think Mr. Johnson has every right to move to
Great Britain.

Stephen Miller, 83

Sincere

Condolences

Over
Constraint

Dear Editor:

I would simply like to offer
my sincere condolences to Ed
Johnson for being constrained
here at Washington and Lee for
four years. Furthermore, I feel
that I, as well as any fraternity
member on campus who has
been similarly deluded about
their friends, owe Mr. Johnson
a great vote of thanks for poin-
ting out the shallowness of our
lives. Finally, I believe that the
evaluation he offers of his un-
fortunate lack of a liberal arts
education is very appropriate.
A true appreciation. of the
knowledge offered by the
liberal arts should enable an in-
dividual to better understand
himself and others without un-
substantiated bias or cynicism.
I agree that Mr. Johnson has
not gained that appreciation
here at W&L, and I certainly
wish him better luck at Cam-
bridge.

Sincerely,
Edmund Perry, ’82

The President On Liberal Education

On Saturday, November 4, 1978 W&L President Robert E.R.
Huntley delivered a series of remarks to several hundred parents
and students entitled In Defense of Liberal Arts Education.

The word “‘liberal”’ is used in so many contexts with so many dif-
fering connotations that we may forget that its primary meaning
has to do with freedom: liberty and liberation. A liberal education
is an education designed to liberate the mind, to free it from ig-
norance and from the animal emotions and instincts which may
constrict and dominate it, and to free it from the aimless and
useless thrashings-about to which the untutored intellect is prone.

A liberal education is intenaed to cause the mind to become as
useful as it is capable of being. In this sense, the purpose of a liberal

education is the most utilitarian of all.

Let me mention a few of my ideas about the way in which a
liberal arts college like Washington and Lee attempts — or should

 

attempt — to provide its students the foundation of a liberal educa-
tion, to help its students develop useful minds.

The curriculum should include courses in all or nearly all the sub-
jects which time has proven to be fit for disciplined and orderly in-
quiry and which reveal and explore important segments of
mankind’s accumulated experience. It’s easy to discern certain
subjects which must be included —history and literature, for exam-
ple. Others come quickly to mind; the natural sciences, philosophy,
religion, economics, for example.

All these subjects, and some others, readily meet the two basic
criteria. I suggested earlier. Each is a fit subject for orderly and
disciplined inquiry. Each encompasses a massive accumulation of

thought and knowledge and wisdom of mankind over an extended

Huntley’s Comments On W&L Education

(continued from page 1)
tion by the best minds of
the past. Thus, each can be

taught and learned in a
manageable way.
The courses, properly

selected and properly taught,
must be imbedded in a cur-
ricular structure which is well
ordered and purposeful. A ran-
dom array will not do. The
undergraduate student must be
guided into this cirriculum in a
way which will cause him to
achieve two immediate objec-
tives. First, he must have a
significant learning experience
in each of the several kinds of
Subjects which make ‘up a
liberal arts curriculum
—humanities, natural sciences,
languages, social sciences.

Furthermore, the student is
required to achieve approx-
imate mastery of at least one
liberal arts subject. He may
become a major in economics,
or physics, or English, for ex-
ample.

Note that this process, the
liberal arts process, is not the
Same as what is sometimes call-
ed ‘‘general education.’’
‘General education,’ if I
understand that term, seeks to
tell the student a little bit about
a lot of things — to produce a
well-informed and presumably
well-adjusted human being. A
liberal arts education
postulates that the student
should have the real experience
of learning and thinking in each
of several arenas of knowledge
where the greatest minds of the
past have plowed fertile ground
— and that in one of them, he
should become, as nearly as he
can, an expert. Its purpose is
not to produce well-informed
graduates, though it may in-
cidentally do that. Its purpose is
to produce’ well-educated
graduates, who can quickly
become well informed in almost
any field, and who can apply a
tough and discriminating in-
tellect to the information they
obtain.

The ideal of the liberal arts
tradition is not easily attained,
even by those institutions such
as Washington and Lee which
strive purposefully to attain it.

Education has been confused
with training. A bird dog needs
training, and if he is to be a good
bird dog, he must have training.
A human being needs educa-
tion, and if he is to be a good
human being, he must have
education. Human beings may
also be trained — whether or
not they are educated. But for
an important task, any in-
telligent employer except a
despot will always choose an
untrained well-educated person
over an uneducated well-
trained one. For human beings,
training is important;
education is vital.

It is also possible that many
of our large public institutions
— not all, but many — have long
since lost the battle to preserve
a liberal educational ideal. If
this is true, then the last line of
defense is the independent
liberal arts college, which is not
in a strong position to exert ef-
fective pressure on our educa-
tional system.

The public education system
faces its own problems. In re-
cent years we have all heard
much about the diminishing
college-age population. Most
private institutions — certainly
Washington and Lee — have

long since learned to live, and
indeed desire to live, with stu-
dent populations of stable size.

Most public institutions have
become accustomed to living on
what I would call ‘‘the margin
of growth’’ in the years since
World War II; in those years,
there have been rapid annual
increases in_- student
enrollments at nearly all public
institutions. At most such in-
stitutions, increased operating
income is a direct and im-
mediate result of increased stu-
dent body size, but the addi-
tional costs of enlarged size

tend to lag by several years.

Therefore, even if there are
no permanent unit economies of
scale to be derived from
largness, there will be an ap-
parent financial health provid-

ed by the margin of growth. As
that growth diminishes or levels
off to zero, the pressure on the
public institution to find
students will become increas-
ingly insistent.

Also as the numbers diminish
and at the same time,
legislators and _ legislatures
become more and more restric-
tive about their willingness to
keep open the faucet of
unlimited public funds, public
institutions all over the country
are turning to private philan-
throphy. I don’t blame them for
that, I simply cite it as a fact.

I would point out one or two
salient economic points about
that observation. For the public
institution, private philan-
thropy is the icing on the cake.
For us, it is the cake.

There are other threats of this
practical variety. There is
however, one _ philosophical
threat that is perhaps of greater
concern. :

I believe there is a growing
doubt among educators and
among the populace of America
about the value of the kind -of
education I’ve ‘ attempted to
describe. I am no longer as cer-
tain as I would have been twen-
ty years ago, no longer as cer-
tain as I would like to be, that
most persons in America agree
with my emphasis on the impor-
tance of liberal education.

I suspect that this grows from
several factors. The increasing
demand for practicality, for im-
mediate applicability of
everything learned, is one.
Another, more disturbing, is the
increasing distrust of reason
and rationality. You can see it
all around you — the turn to the
occult, to the metaphysical; the
eschewing of reason as the
primary basis for human ex-

To these kinds of criticisms,
education should respond
positively and with conviction.
It is my impression that it has
not yet done so.

At Washington and Lee, I
believe I can speak for the
faculty, the students, and Board
of Trustees in assuring you that
it is our determined intention to
retain our educational ideal. We

Christmas dance held last term.
Elam said that of 300 tickets
available, only 122 were sold.

The E.C. also heard midterm
reports from other organiza-
tions, including the Ring-tum
Phi, the Calyx, the Student Bar
Association, the Ariel and the
Mock Convention.

Ring-tum Phi editor John
Billmyre was questioned by
Senior representative Marshall
Clark about the paper’s lack of
quality. The E.C. also decided
to inquire into the possibility of
the Phi using journalism equip-
ment, including a computer
system, in Reid Hall.

Speaking for the Calyx,
Editor Peter Eliades noted that
the yearbook is still having pro-
blems getting senior pictures
completed. Eliades said that
pictures will cost an extra $2
because of price increases
made by his photographer.

will survive as at least one in-
stitution that believes in the
liberal education, in the value of
the human mind and in the
aspirations of the human spirit.
With continued assistance, this
school, two hundred years from
now, will still represent the
traditions and the strengths
which it has represented for the
two hundred years that have
gone before.

 

Ariel Editor Channing Hall
announced that 200 copies of the
Ariel’s fall issue remain from a
total of 1200 printed.. Hall said
that he has $1200 to budget for a
spring issue.

Student Bar Association
Treasurer Hop Xing fielded
questions concerning the ex-
istence of an SAB outing club
and its events overlapping with
the W&L outing club. Xing said
the two club’s schedules conflict
too much for an agreement to
be worked out.

Junior Representative Eric
Myers noted that the Generals
of Jazz music ensemble is a
good example of an organiza-
tion consisting of both
undergraduate and law school
students. Xing noted that the
Generals of Jazz was founded
by law students, however.

The E.C. later agreed that a
combination of the two groups
would be a good way to improve
the program.

Hartog Compares Admissions

by Mike Perry

The notion that it is difficult to
get into college may be out-
dated except for a select group
of well-known schools, accor-
ding to a new study by the Col-
lege Board.

The Board’s study contends
that it is becoming increasingly
easier for students to gain ac-
ceptance to American colleges
and universities. The study
reported that 83 percent of col-
lege applications were accepted
in 1978 and suggests that almost
every student applying to col-
lege found one to attend.

Director of Admissions
William Hartog agrees with the
report’s findings and says the
situation has existed throughout
much of the 1970’s owing largely

to an overbuilt public educa-
tional system. ‘College admis-
sion competition is far easier,
and it’s going to get easier, ex-
cept for these few colleges, like

‘W&L; Ihope.”’

Hartog says Washington and
Lee competes on a ‘‘fast track”’
with schools such as the Univer-
sity of Virginia, William and
Mary, Davidson and Duke for
qualified applicants; but he also
believes W&L has more than
kept pace with its competitors.

Washington and Lee accepted
56 percent of its applicants last
year and Hartog contends that
W&L’s ‘“‘degree of selectivity
has increased.’’ Washington
and Lee received 975 applica-
tions to its freshman class in
1978 while 1414 students applied

Small Talk With
SAB Co-Chairman

by M. Shaw Pyle

Jamie Small’s face wears a
harried, hurried look these
days, and the Student Activities
Board co-chairman says that
it’s all because of his position.
Small puts in at least 20 hours
each week for the SAB — more
as Fancy Dress approaches.
But he says his frown is not
because of the time involved,
but rather because of the lack of
involvement by his _ fellow
students most of the time.

Small and co-chairman Pryse
Elam have attempted to diver-
sify the type of entertainment
the SAB offers and increase the
numbers of social activities on
campus. So far, Small says, stu-
dent response has been dismal
at best. Attempts to plan pro-
grams to meet requests by in-
terested students, as was done
in the fall Backgammon Tour-
nament and the booking of a na-
tionally known soul group in the
Cockpit, ended in heavy finan-
cial losses when Minks stayed

As _ if Small didn’t have
enough on his hands, a feud
between the SAB and the Ex-
ecutive Committee may be im-
minent. Fueled by rumors, a
basic disagreement between
the two organizations has
started to assume the propor-
tions of a large conflict. Small
complains of the EC’s basic
lack of support for campus
organizations other than itself
and claims that it is so caught
up in mutual admiration among
the members that its effec-

last year. Hartog expects the
number to grow this year.

Hartog explained that a
variety of other factors will con-
tribute or make competition for
the most qualified students ‘‘ex-
cructiating in the next five
years.’’ The number of college-
aged students is expected to
decline by 23 percent.

College admissions officials
must be conscious of trends as
reflected in stastical data and
their effect on W&L’s potential
applicant pool, as-distinct from
national demographic changes.

Hartog cited Virginia as an
example in an article published
recently in Alumni Magazine,
“37,206 high school seniors took
the SAT and may thus be con-
sidered ‘college-bound.’ But
fewer than half of them — 16,486
— were men. And of the men,
only 2,005 scored at or above the
W&L averages on the SAT and
ranked in the top 40 percent of
their classes. And of those 2,005
in Virginia, only 891 came from
families with an income suffi-
cient to pay Washington and
Lee’s tuition.”

The problem of accepting
precisely the number of ap-
plicants which will result in a
freshman class of 350 is par-
ticularly acute this year due to
the campus housing shortage

‘the renovation of Graham-Lees

dormitory is expected to create.
‘‘We cannot have any more than
350 this year,” says Hartog.

W&L will probably accept
770-790 applications in hopes of
attracting a freshman class
which numbers as close to 350
as possible.

W&L Stuns Roanoke

by Dale Park

“We really appreciate the
crowd and the unknown fans.
Without them, we could not
have won the ballgame.”

The man who said these
words was Washington and Lee
Hea@ basketball Coach Verne
Canfield. The game he was
referring to was his team’s
stunning 96-79 trouncing of
Roanoke College, a team
previously ranked fourth in the
nation in the NCAA Division III
of the NCAA.

The win was W&L’s biggest so
far this season, stretching the
Generals’ victory streak to
eight games and pulling W&L
into a first place tie with
Roanoke in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. Both
Roanoke and W&L are 4-1 in
ODAC play.

Although Roanoke brought a

perfect 14-0 record into the con-
test, Canfield explained that his
team tried not to ‘‘get up too
much for the game, because
after you get up, you can only
come down.”’ Canfield claimed
that his team has tried “‘to play
on an even keel”’ all season.

That ‘‘even keel’? might have
easily been rocked by the
Generals’ loss of senior forward
and co-captain R.J. Scaggs.
Scaggs broke his wrist in W&L’s
82-79 double-overtime victory
over Emory & Henry and will
be out for the remainder of the
year.

Filling in for Scaggs has been
junior forward Clark New. And
New, normally the team’s sixth
man, has done nothing short of
an outstanding job.

New has averaged well over
20 points a game in the con-

Four Alumni Inducted Into ODK

Four prominent alumni of
Washington and Lee University
were inducted as_ honorary
members of Omicron _ Delta

class of 1930 since 1974, and has
been one of the most successful
fundraisers in the university’s
history. In 1980, Jones raised
almost $54,000 for the universi-
ty’s annual fund with donations
from 92 percent of the members
of his class.

Lanier received his B.S.

EC Hears More Midterms

by Bill Whalen
The Executive Committee
heard the last of the midterm
reports at Monday night’s two-
and-one-half hour meeting.

Following the reports, the EC
had heated discussions over its
role in both a student-sponsored
game and the Muscular
Dystrophy Danceathon. The
game the EC discussed is a
‘‘killer game’”’ organized by the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity for
the purpose of raising money.
At the end of the announcement
of the game, a statement ap-
pears explaining that the honor
system applies to the rules of
the game.

The EC’s main concern was
whether the statement is a
reference to an individual honor
code or the Washington & Lee
honor system.

After a lengthy discussion,
the committee decided that the
EC would take no direct part in
the rules of the game.

In the matter of the
Danceathon, the EC was con-
sidering whether or not to use
money from its reserve fund as
a donation to a proposed run
from Hollins to this campus by
a Washington & Lee student.

EC President Bob Willis first
brought up the proposal, argu-
ing that an EC donation would
“get more people involved”
with the MD fundraising drive.

Leading the opposition to this

move was EC Vice-President
Willie Mackie. ‘‘We should give
a check to the Danceathon
rather than an individual,’’ said
Mackie, who stressed that the
EC should look at ‘‘the merits of
each case.”’

After trying to pass measures
to either donate the money or
not participate in the run, the
committee resolved to take up
the issue at next week’s
meeting.

In the only financial transac-
tion, the EC approved an $850
grant to the W&L Rugby Club.
The club’s president, Alex
Richards, had requested nearly
$1200, but the EC decided that
the club could set back on
several expenses, including the
purchase of rugby movies and
Gatorade for games.

Speaking for the Admissions
Committee, Mike Perry an-
nounced the school has received
789 applications from prospec-
tive students, while the final
number should be almost 1440.
Perry also stated that the Ad-
missions Office is making an
effort to recruit more students
from the West and Midwest,
while taking attention away
from the Northeast.

Publications Board Chairman
Channing Hall reported to the
EC that the Pub Board has
named Craig Cornett and Prof.
Hampden H. Smith III as its
faculty advisors.

Hall was then questioned by

Willis over last week’s EC
resolution to financially review
student organizations. Hall ex-
plained the Pub Board’s role in
financial review, saying that
“the publications look over
each others’ budgets.”’

Junior Representative Tripp
Brower was in favor of the EC
taking a more active role in
reviewing the records of stu-
dent publications. ‘‘I can see ad-
vantages in the EC reviewing
everyone,’’ said Brower.
“We're not out to get anyone,
we're just trying to make sure
the money is where it is.”

Cold Check Chairman Mike
Malesardi told the EC that his
committee has received bad
checks totalling $1100. Malesar-
di said he sent out 35 letters con-
cerning bad checks, and was
able to clear up ten cases.

Contact spokesman Robert
McLean told the EC that his
committee has raised over
$17,000 from funds given by the
EC, the Intrafraternity Council,
and donations by parents. Con-
tact also announced a line-up of
speakers, which _ Includes
author John Barth, baseball
personality Jom _ Bouton,
political cartoonist Jeff
MacNelly, and famous im-
poster Frank Abagnale.

The EC will hold its next
meeting Monday night at 6:30
p.m.

Burn Hillympus

My ulcer is killing me. Woe is poor Prometheus, humble servant
to the grand race of Fraternal Greeks. Woe is poor Prometheus, a
fallen prince, who dared defy the gods atop Mt. Hillympus. I am
chained like an errant dog, a prisoner in the library; a martyr to
the cause, to the glories of Red Square.

Long, long ago, the gods lived happily atop Mt. Hillympus.
Ensconsced in the etherial bliss of academic, these arbitrary kings
knew little of the trials and tribulations of the angelic Greeks over
whom they ruled. Far removed from the glories of Narcotica and

the horrors of nosexia, the gods (notably one Dr. Seuss) decided to
abolish the entire human race, which is to say they desired to
destroy the Greeks. (For the sake of argument, we won’t include
the independent subspecies of a more simian nature).

The skies trembled and the fun-loving sportive, amorous, inno-
cent mortals ran for cover in their dilapidated sheds. They prayed
to Dr. Seuss to grant them mercy. They called on all the gods and
promised to reform; all they wanted was to go on as happy Greeks.
Again, the skies trembled and Dr. Seuss answered their prayers:

“IT smell a rat in the frat anda nat my flat. No Greeks, no frats ‘till

One god, poor Prometheus (that’s me) heard these ominous
words and the prayers of the poor Greeks. “‘Bring us fire! Bring us
fire! We will burn Mt. Hillympus. We will burn the Hill and all these
false and greedy gods!’’ So I brought fire and fire with a
vengeance. I brought the Greeks fire water! Delicious fire water
that inflames the soul and when consumed in large quanities makes
mortals immortal. Yes, every Wednesday — in defiance of the false
gods —the Greeks consume their fire water.

Yes, every Greek knows Prometheus brought fire to the Greeks.
Now I am chained; an eagle tears at my liver. But little does that
eagle know that I, too, consume fire water. I have no liver left! My

Latture Award Established

The Washington and Lee
University chapter of the na-
tional leadership fraternity,
Omicron Delta Kappa, has an-
nounced establishment of the
Rupert N. Latture Outstanding
Sophomore Award to be given
annually, in the spring, to the
W&L sophomore who best ex-
emplifies the ideals of ODK.

Rupert N. Latture, for whom
the award is named, is the sole

surviving founder of the
organization which orginated
on the W&L campus in 1914.

Latture, who now serves as
special assistant to Washington
and Lee president Robert E.R.
Huntley, celebrated his 89th
birthday on Jan. 18, the day
before ODK announced the new
award in his honor at its annual
induction ceremony.

 

Small

(continued from page 1)
tiveness is greatly diminished.
More specifically, he claims
that its policy of announcing
budget disbursements as late as
October leaves the SAB and
similar groups in a_ bind.
Waiting for funding to plan ac-
tivities may mean missing op-
portunities to book entertain-
ment groups with demanding
schedules; trying to guess at
one’s prospective budget can
lead to overspending, as Small
apologetically admits occurred
this past fall.

And the controversy over the
EC’s review of SAB finances is
a continuing source of conten-
tion. Small accepts the commit-
tee’s right to check the books of
any student funded organiza-
tion, but is furious with its man-
ner of doing so: ‘I told (Bob
Willis, EC president) if he’s
looking at our books to dump on
me or on Pryse or on anybody,
he can take my job and shove
,":

Rumors of another conflict —
a knock-down, drag-out bet-
ween Small and Pryse Elam —
are dismissed out of hand by
Small. He admits to a conflict of
tastes between the two, but at-
tributes occasional flare-ups to
the nature of co-chairmanships
and the personalities involved.
‘‘Pryse and I,’’ observed Small

‘fight a lot. We’re both bull
headed...but...don’t worry.”
Small is convinced that neither
problems with Elam and Willis
nor apathy on the part of the
student body and faculty will
mar Fancy Dress for the year.
Fancy Dress_ preparations
are, in fact, going smoothly and
a little ahead of schedule says

Small. This vear’s nush is to be
on the music. Small says decor

has peaked as an item of enter-

tainment, and his committee’s
shot at immortality will be
made by providing six of the
best bands they could find. John
Prine will play early Thursday
evening, to leave the night open-
ing for pavilion parties spon-
sored — in spite of administra-
tion grumblings — by any
organization willing to do so.
And the Ball itself has five
groups: ‘‘the’ best or-
chestra...we could get beside
Duke Ellington’s,” a ‘‘very
good” Chicago blues band, a
Dixieland jazz ensemble, a 50’s
hot rock group, and a country
and western set. In addition, the
SAB is providing comics,
mimes, magicians, and street
vendors.

Small’s comment on his job is
simple: ‘“‘I’ll help anyone...if
they need a group...but I wish
there’d be more participation
(apathy ) isn’t funny anymore.”
ODK ‘Taps’ 19 New Members

Nineteen undergraduates and
law students at Washington and
Lee University were ‘“‘tapped”’
Monday into membership in
Omicron Delta Kappa, the na-
tional honorary leadership
society. The ceremonies took
place as part of the university’s
annual Founders’ Day convoca-
tion.

Omicron Delta Kappa was
established at Washington in
1914 and now has chapters in
more than 160 colleges and
universities throughout the na-
tion. The society recognizes
superior leadership
achievements in one or more
fields — athletics, student
government, _ publications,
social and religious affairs, and
the creative arts. Students
“tapped”’ must rank in the top
35 percent of their academic
class.

As the date of the superdance
approaches, Superdance ’81 co-
chairman Jay Hemby wishes to
remind W&L students of the
necessity of their support for
both Daniels and Superdance
‘81. He has also attempted to
enlist the help of the VMI cadets
to dance and raise money, Un-
fortunately, the cadets cannot
attend a social event such as
Superdance ’81 without first
receiving a written invitation
from W&L. After the invitation
has been extended, the comma-
dent of the academy must ap-
prove the request. Due to this
cumbersome system, Hemby
believes that only a limited
number of cadets will be allow-
ed to actively participate.

Class Of 84 Posts Higher Grades

by Skeeter Miniter

As forecasted by the high
Scholastic Aptitude test scores
and high class rank, the class of
1984’s Grade Point Average was
considerably higher than first
semester grades in previous
years.

“The aptitude of the class of
1984 certainly was borne out by
the grades they received this
fall’ said Dean of Freshmen, H.
Robert Huntley. Compared with
last year’s freshman fall
semester G.P.A. — con-
siderably below 2.5 — the class
of 1984 had a “‘2.5 plus,” accor-
ding to Huntley. Also, although
last year’s freshmen had 10 per-
cent more students, the number
of freshmen who made honor
roll remained at 31. This year’s

freshman class has 63 Deans
List members also, as opposed
to 57 the year before.

“Overall academic improve-
ment occurred up and down the
line,” according to Huntley. He
defended his case by citing
“‘that only 29/338 were below
the 1.5 probation level as oppos-
ed to 43/365 in the class of 1983.”

‘Admissions sure is doing
their job,’ according to
Huntley. He further explained
that last year “more money
was spent in the search of new
students.”

Huntley also cited that the
success of the freshman class
continues at the same level out-
side the classroom.

“The dorm counselors have

called me with far fewer pro-

blems,’”’ declared Huntley.
“The first auspicious note oc-
curred after the Hollins mixer
when the Dean over there called
back with rave reviews of the
interesting and mature
freshmen from W&L.” Huntley
continued, ‘‘This year’s class is
more the old W&L type, the one
we write about in the catalogue.
The upperclassmen here tend to
be socialistic about grades.
They are concerned with what
they need to see in a course.”’
Perhaps the final tribute
Huntley or anyone else could
make occurred when he said,
“Freshmen maturity tends to

dissipate as Fraternal
foolishness increases. That
didn’t happen this year.”

Kappa Sigma Makes
Bid For New House

by Scott Slade
The rechartered Kappa
Sigma social fraternity is ac-
tively taking its case to area
residents in hopes of reoccupy-
ing the former location of the
chapter.

Rather than wait for the Jan.
22 public hearing before the
Lexington Planning Commis-
sion, the Kappa Sigs have com-
piled a list of 60 residences
around the house to plead their
case and hopefully obtain a
favorable concensus for the
hearing. Fraternity president
Scott Dacus said that most of
the residents have been con-
tacted and that he is optimistic.
The only opposition thus far,
has been from the occupants of
the residence behind the old
Kappa Sig house. Oddly enough,
the families on either side have
expressed no opposition.

The former chapter folded in

1970 for financial reasons but a
group of students applied for a
new charter last year and in-
itiated 14 members on May
17th.

The house is occupied, by
Genevieve Friedman, her
children, and a few boarders.
The price has been negotiated
at $90,000. The sale is contingent
on the decision of the Lexington
Planning Commission.

There is currently no area in
the city limits zoned for frater-
nity houses. Permission to
locate a fraternity in Lexington
requires a special exception of
the City Council which acts
upon the recommendation of
the Planning Commission. The
chairman of the Planning Com-
mission is W&L professor H.L.
Ravenhorst. He could not be
reached for comment.

The hearing will begin at 5
p.m. on Jan. 22 in City Hall.

Todd Hobin performed in the
Cockpit Saturday night. His
eyes were electric when he clut-
ched the microphone to his face,
when he ran his fingers through
his hair, when he danced about
in the limited confines of the
“‘stage”’ and into the audience,
taking his Ovation guitar with
him. Everything about his per-
formance was filled with a wild,
frenetic energy that more than
pleased the large audience.

Backstage (a term that can
only be used humorously when
referring to our Pit) Todd Hobin
sat quietly in a folding chair, his
eyes serene, his gestures small
and his voice so soft it was
sometimes drowned out by the
clatter of the other band
members. He Jovks like the guy
up there playing, but he doesn’t
act the same.

‘Everyone says that,’ he
laughed. ‘‘It’s the music. It’s
fun. Some people drink and do
drugs — music is a much better
high. I mean, I’ve chipped my
teeth on microphones before..”’

You can’t tell by looking at
him.

The Todd Hobin Band was
formed in 1975 by Todd, his
brother Shawn, Doug Moncrief
and Desi Desnoyers. Guitarist
Bruce Fowler joined the group
three years ago. Their technical
and vocal skills can be attested
to by anyone who saw them
Saturday. Most of the songs in
their repertoire are original,
although they included some
show-stopping numbers by Bob
Seger and Crosby, Stills, Nash

and Young.
The Band’s second album,
Passion and the Pain,was

released last week and has
already sold 10,000 copies (their
first album, released in 1978,
has sold 12,000 copies to date)
and Todd was swamped last
weekend by phone calls of
praise and congratulations. The
band records under the Aries
label, named after Todd’s dog.
The band’s’ performance
enhances songs that are
refreshing, if for no other
reason because the lyrics are
more than one-dimensional.
“Every song I write,” said
Todd, “Is about something
that’s very real to me. John
Lennon said he wrote on three
themes: love, peace, and ex-
perience. You can take all of
Willie Nelson’s songs, I think,
from the beginning up til now,
back to back, and you’d have a
musical autobiography.

The Todd Hobin Band

Serious, Energetic Professionals

“IT don’t do that. But what I
write isn’t boogie oogie oogie.”’

No, it’s not.

The band is a cohesive unit on
stage and a self-described fami-
ly on the road.

Doug Moncrief, keyboardist,
vocalist and guitarist said ‘‘The
best way to get a band together,
aside from auditions, is to see
how well everyone gets along
together.’’ The band is accom-
panied on road trips by a six-

 

4
Lae
Desi Desnoyers

member crew. Several band
members are married, but their
wives rarely travel with them.

‘My mother didn’t go with
my father to work,’’ said Mon-
crief,

The band travels frequently
up and down the East Coast.
They are planning a southern
tour for the spring and Todd
says the new album is selling in
Ohio and Michigan, where
they’ve never played.

 

 

Bruce Fowler walks over to
where Todd and Doug were be-
where Todd and Doug were be-
ing interviewed. ‘‘What lies are
demands. ‘‘That I’m 62 and
blond?”’

The band’s closeness is pretty
obvious. ;

They return home to upstate
New York to play a show with
the Allman Brothers this week
before coming back to Virginia
for appearances at Ferrum and

 

 

Shawn Hobin
Dabney Lancaster Community
College. Talk about passion and
the pain! Actually, they’re used
to small college towns; Todd
and Doug graduated from the
Crane School of Music in tiny
Crane, N.Y.

The Todd Hobin Band is a suc-
cess by any measure, certainly
they are hot. Without trying to
sound cliche, not much appears
to stand between them and the
top.

Alcohol Film

The film, ‘‘I’ll Quit Tomor- described. ‘I'he progress of the

row” is based on a book with the
same title, written by Vernon E.
Johnson.

There are three films with a
total running time of 88
minutes. The first film (30
minutes) will be shown on
Wednesday, January 28, as a
part of a workshop by the Fami-
ly Life Council of the Mental
Health Association of
Rockbridge County with help
from Alcohol Services of
Rockbridge (ASOR). The film
will be shown at V.M.I. at Le-
jeune Hall, second floor,
7:30-9:30 p.m. on Wednesday,
January 28.

The film belongs to ASOR and
all three films may be borrowed
by any local organization.

The story line:

The film tells of what happen-
ed to Steve Miller and his fami-
ly as he develops the illness of
alcoholism. How it progressed
in his family and work life is

disease is traced, how it was ar-
rested by a successful interven-
tion by the family and
employer, and how treatment
was given in a hospital setting.
The film describes the behavior
of the significant persons
around Steve and how they at
first enabled him to get sicker,
but later helped in his recovery.

Much valuable information
about clinical dependency is
given in a voice, over which
conveys facts about the illness
and treatment.

The film to be seen on
Wednesday, January 28th,
shows the mood swing syn-
drome and physiology of
chemical dependency and the
urgent need for outside help.

A Rocker Returns

‘Catholic Boy’ and the
Comeback of Jim Carroll

by RobinC. Meredith _

Take equal measures of Patti Smith, Tonio K.,
and the Boomtown Rats, blend thoroughly, throw
in a dash of Lou Reed to add an appropriately
streetwise atmosphere, and if your imagination
stretches that far you’ll have a decent idea of what
the Jim Carroll Band’s debut album sounds like.
That’s one reason I’ve had so much trouble
evaluating this record; the man appeals to my
natural instincts so thoroughly I find it hard to be
objective — listening to the Jim Carroll Band for

 

Recordings

 

me is like downing a favorite bottle of wine or
biting into a juicy thick steak. My problems aside,
the fact remains that Carroll has been causing
quite a stir in some rather high places lately;
Penthouse has already done an in-depth interview
with him, his album is doing quite well on the
charts (81 with a bullet after 3 weeks, a strong
showing for a debut), and the single from the
album, ‘‘People Who Died’, has been getting
more than its share of play on album rock radio.

Why all this fuss over a left-field debut effort?
One look at the ‘‘saga”’ of Jim Carroll and I’m su’
you’ll understand. Born and raised in Manhatt:
Carroll became addicted to heroin practic:
before reaching puberty. An_ extraordin.
athlete, he attended a private high school on .
basketball scholarship, and at the age of thirteen
wrote The Basketball Diaries, a collection of
autobiographical writing that prompted Jack
Kerouac to claim that ‘‘at 13 years of age, Jim
Carroll writes better than 89 percent of the
novelists working today.’

That was in 1963. Since then, Carroll’s work has

 

   

Alvin-Bennis

appeared in several literary journals, including
the Paris Review. His second volume of poetry,
Living at the Movies, was nominated for a Pulitzer
Prize. He kicked heroin in 1971. Now, at the age of
30, he has a band and analbum.

This is a classic rock’n’roll legend with a very
definite twist. It looks as though Carroll has
already gone through the personal catharsis that
marred the careers of other ‘‘legends’’ like Jim
Morrison, Brian Jones, and Janis Joplin. Carroll
“settled down” into rock’n’roll; consequently,
Catholic Boy lacks the urgency and, to be honest,
the borderline insanity that made debut efforts by
his spiritual brethren (Smith’s Horses, Tonio K.s
Life in the Foodchain) such breathtaking ex-
periences. Amateur passion is conspicuously ab-
sent here. Part of this has to do with Carroll’s own
instincts, which are remarkably mainstream for
this day and age. His songs are suffused with an
optimistic, melodic warmth that flies in the face of
New Wave dissonance. Reactionary musical
values and a lack of cutting edge passion make
this a curiously uninspiring record. |

There are moments here, to be sure. People Who
Died is a grisly obituary set at a breakneck tempo
over a wall of blazing guitars. City Drops Into the
Night is as good a piece of post-Springsteen street-
wise romanticism as anyone has come up with yet,
and Nothing Is True, an evocative ballad, shows
that Carroll’s restraint is not always a bad thing.

All in all, this is a very promising debut.
Hopefully, Carroll’s career won’t be plagued by ig-
norant journalists who expect him to live up to a
legend that he would probably rather see forgotten
(myself included). For this, we’ll just have to wait
and see. In the meantime, give Catholic Boy an A-
and pray that Carroll sees fit to include a lyric
sheet with his next album.

The Ring-tum Phi Presents A Midterm Ana

by W. Cope Moyers

This year’s Executive Committee has
done an impressive job during its first five
months in office governing the student
body. Unlike some previous administra-
tions, this committee has experienced few
internal squabbles and has actively wrestl-
ed with crucial issues important to the
university and students. The EC attempts
to change the pass/fail system, revise the
procedures governing student body elec-
tions and constitution and tighten the
budget should be applauded. Although the
committee’s efforts have far outpaced
results, this year’s committee has con-
tinued to work hard to affect changes it
believes are necessary.

One of the most positive. steps taken by
this Executive Committee has been tighter
control of the many university sub-
committees under EC jurisdiction. In past
years, many of these committees rarely
appeared before the EC and ran things as
they wished. In several cases, too many of
these sub-committee members were
answerable to nobody bui themselves.
That has changed since Bob Willis and Co.

PARR

   

JEFF EDWARDS

have taken a closer loak at sub-committee
operations. Each committee, from Contact
to Student Health, is now required to ap-
pear before the EC each month and pre-
sent written reports on past, present and
future activities. There have been in-
stances in which the EC has ordered a sub-
committee to return before the committee
because of unsatisfactory reports. These
actions have made the subcommittees
more efficiently and effectively run and
made them more answerable to the EC.
But the committee’s efforts to control all
the subcommittees has not been without
some controversy, as seen in the con-
tinuous tug-of-war between the Publica-
tions Board and EC. This confrontation
has generated unneeded animosity bet-
ween members of the two committees and
is still not completely resolved. Hopefully
this issue will be put to rest before the end
of the school year.

The committee should also be commend-
ed for actively pursuing the question of
adequate security for students while on
and off campus. The EC’s handling of this
matter has prompted the Lexington City
Council, Lexington police chief and even
university president Huntley to address
the issue with promises of more support.
The EC has done all it possibly could to
guarantee the safety of both students and
their personal property. It is now up to city
officials to implement the steps necessary
to keep students safe. Future Executive
Committees should take note of this com-
mittee’s actions on the matter, especially
if adequate security is absent in the future.

This Executive Committee has also
recognized the need for clarifications and
revisions in the honor system. President
Bob Willis has said he would like to rewrite
parts of the honor code, a massive yet im-

 

   

BOB WILLIS

portant project the committee has before
it. If the committee plans on instituting the

’ changes before the end of this year, it will

have to work against the clock — June is
approaching quickly.

Students are well-represented by this
year’s Executive Committee. Not only do
members concern themselves with pro-
blems inherent to the entire university
community, but they also have confronted
the individual problems common to each
of the four classes and the law school. If
the EC works as hard the next five months
as it did the first five, then Willis and Co.
will be remembered as hard working

 

  
   

MIKE NOGAY

tough, objective and — most important
—capable of recognizing the many pro-
blems synonymous with a small, private
university and complex honor code.

Bob Willis — The president of the Ex-
‘ecutive Committee knows what he is doing
and what the committee should be doing.
Senior Bob Willis is the kind of president
the EC and student body needed. He is a
leader, but he permits others on the com-
mittee to take the lead on many of the im-
portant issues. He is patient, allowing
anyone to talk who wants to, yet hauling in
the reins when necessary. He can be cool
under pressure, but he can get tough when
it’s important for him to be tough. He
discusses matters with the mayor, police
chief, professor and student alike, yet has
the ability to listen.

Most EC meetings proceed smoothly
because Willis is knowledgable on what’s
to be discussed even before the full com-
mittee meets. He knows the honor code
and constitution well enough to comment
freely and confidently on matters concern-
ing them. But he is never afraid to look
something up when he or the committee is
confused; meetings are sometimes
delayed a minute or two while Willis
checks the White Book.

This year’s EC has already tackled
several timely problems and Willis is
directly responsible. Amendments to the
constitution were already approved and
ready for student vote in late October, the
ongoing controversy with the Publications
Board was discussed at the first EC

WILLIE MACKIE

meeting and the security problem was
discussed quickly and without delay.

Willis also gets the credit for recent
changes in the pass/fail system. Although
he was fighting against heavy odds and his
original proposals were greatly trimmed
by an uncompromising courses and
degrees committee, Willis did change a
rigid system that has needed revisions for
many years.

Willis has once and for all made the
many subcommittees that operate at W&L
directly answerable to the EC. Gone are
the days when subcommittees did what
they wanted, wasted money and failed to
do what they were supposed to do. Willis
and the EC now watch these subcom-
mittees closely and question them on even
the most trivial matters.

Willis has also recognized that the honor
system needs some amending and he has
said he is going to affect the necessary
changes by June. He cannot do it alone, but
because Willis is a strong and well-
respected student body president, there is,
for the first time in many years, a real
chance the changes can be made.

It is still too early in the year to judge
Willis’ full impact as a tough, yet com-
promising president. That can only be
done in June, when the executive commit-
tee finishes up its work. A lot will happen
in the coming months and Willis is ready to
approach problems that will inevitably oc-
cur.

Willie Mackie — If there is anyone who
knows where the money is, where it’s go-
ing and why it’s going there, it has to be
vice-president and treasurer Willie
Mackie. He is in full control of all the
money allocated to the EC and ultimately,
the student body. Mackie is innovative
enough to deposit concert money returned

    

MARSHALL CLARK

from the Firefall concert in a account that
draws interest and makes money for the
student body. Yet he is conservative
enough to have allocated the numerous
subcommittees only enough money to
operate efficiently. Mackie has trimmed
the fat from the meat and has made
enemies because of it.

Money is not Mackie’s sole responsibili-

 

BUD WHITE

ty and he has often helped Willis guide EC
meetings in a constructive direction.
Mackie is a leader, yet he does not get in
the way of Willis, who is without a doubt
the boss. Mackie’s no nonsense approach
as a treasurer is often reflected in his sug-
gestions and comments at meetings; he
gets right to the point and does not dance
around an argument.

Like most of the other committee
members, Mackie is serious about his
work as an officer of the student body. He
works hard at a job loaded with serious
responsibilities and daily decisions. When
the time comes for a new EC treasurer to
assume control, he will not have to worry
about the committee’s financial position.
Mackie has things under control.

Bud White — The secretary of the EC
rarely has time to contribute to discus-
sions since he is busy trying to record the
minutes, a monumental task which posed
some problems for him earlier in the year.
The minutes were often difficult to read
and not as accurate as they should have
been. However, White has taken some
positive steps to resolve this problem and
recent editions of the minutes have
reflected his efforts.

Thanks to White’s dedication, each week
the minutes are posted at various points
around the campus — there can be no stu-
dent complaints that they don’t know what
the EC is doing. As long as the minutes are
accurate and readable, students can
review discussions and votes of the com-
mittee even without attending the

   

JIM VINES
meetings.

When White does get the chance to par-
ticipate in committee discussions, he often
makes interesting comments that usually
reflect the majority opinion of the commit-
tee.

Jeff Edwards — The law school may be
isolated way down at Lewis Hall, but it is
well represented on the Executive Com-
mittee. Edwards is one of the most vocal
and hard-working members of the com-
mittee who is not only concerned with af-
fairs having to do with the law school, but
also in matters of importance to
undergraduates. He was instrumental in
The Ring-tum Phi, January 22, 1981, Page 7

 

lysis Of The 1980-81 Executive Committee |

exposing many problems that have oc-
curred due to the lack of adequate security

~d is eager to ensure that the entire stu-
dent body, including the law school, has
proper security. During the discussions
about security, Edwards made certain
that the problems faced by law students
were included.

Edwards also figured prominently i in the
EC’s attempt to review the constitution,
co-authoring eleven amendment proposals
with Marshall Clark. Although the motions
failed to pass (not enough students voted),
Edwards’ efforts were not diminished and
he, along with other members, is still
working hard to make the changes that he
says are necessary to bring the constitu-
tion up to date.

Although Edwards’ influence on the EC
is strong, he is always willing to listen to
the other members who both concur and
disagree with him. His arguments are per-
suasive, he is constantly aware of the im-
portant and obscure issues which abound
at W&L and he is not afraid to raise them
with the committee.

Jim Vines — Without a doubt, this senior
is the most controversial, conservative
and hard-nosed member of the EC. He is
never afraid to say what he believes and is
willing to go out further on the limb than
anyone else. Much of the time he is in the

ERIC MYERS
minority on issues that committee votes
“n, but he cannot be intimidated and never
allows a proposal to come to a vote until he
has made his point.

After the eleven proposals that would
have amended the constitution had failed
because too few students voted, Vines mo-
tioned at a meeting to allow two-thirds of
the committee members to amend the con-
stitution instead of students. This was a
radical and controversial proposal that
failed. Only Vines voted in favor of it.
Although it would have put all the power in
the hands of the EC and was not the most
democratic method of amending the con-
stitution, Vines’ motion made a lot of
sense. Nobody else on the committee
would ever consider going as far as Vines
did and more often than not, his sugges-
tions are too much for others to swallow.
But he does not make proposals and argue

at meetings because it’s fun. Vines is —

serious about his position and won't let
anybody, not even his fellow ‘“‘legislators’’
intimidate him.

Vines always questions those who ap-
pear before the committee with sub-
committee reports and requests for
money. He wants to know where the
money is going before it leaves the EC’s
control. He never fails to offer his own sug-
gestions for doing things differently.
Although he is not the most likable
member of the EC, he is dedicated to his
work and not afraid to challenge even the
most popular opinion.

Marshall Clark — Like Edwards, this
senior member of the committee is hard

 

working and never afraid to air his opi-
nions on important issues. He always has
something to say but is not always in
agreement with the majority opinion of the
committee. On the security issue, he was
the first and only EC member who
demanded that President Huntley issue a
statement on university security.

Clark concerns himself with all issues.
With Edwards, he co-authored the eleven
proposed amendments to the constitution.
He is constantly quizzing the heads of the
many subcommittees who are required to
appear before the committee, asking them
about expenditures, operating procedures
and future plans. He was a member of the
fact-finding committee which examined
alcohol abuse at W&L and also is in-
terested in a similar committee to in-
vestigate drug abuse. He gets involved;
when he isn’t questioning or talking at a
meeting, he is listening. Clark can be
tough with both students and university of-
ficials. But he hears and understands both
sides of most issues and never fails to
speak his mind.

Michael Nogay — The second law school
representative on the committee, is also a
newcomer to the EC. He has only been a
member since early November and has
been somewhat overshadowed by Ed-
wards, the elder statesman of the commit-
tee. But Nogay contributes his personal
Opinions at Monday night meetings and
seems particularly concerned about com-
plaints from law students. He was very
vocal on the security question, telling the
committee about numerous complaints
from law students concerning the lack of
lighting on the Wilson Field bridge ann

 

TRIPP BROWER

Davidson Park, where many law students
live, He is aware of the attitudes of law
students and is always ready to speak-up
for them.

Nogay also made several suggestions
concerning the election of first year law
and freshman members to the EC, suppor-
ting run-offs as a means of determining
winners of the elections.

There is room at EC meetings for more
input from Nogay. As he becomes more
familiar and comfortable in his role on the
committee, he will probably contribute

more of his opinions. The law school is well
represented from, both Edwards and
Nogay.

Eric Myers — Although he is one of the
more soft-spoken members of the commit-
tee, Myers is always ready to challenge
other EC members or chairmen of the sub-
committees. He wants answers and ex-
planations and is not content until he
understands completely what the issues
are and what’s at stake. He is not afraid to
try Oe new ; his committee on

FRANK SMITE

alcohol abuse and education at W&L is a
bold step, the first time the EC has ex-
amined this controversial issue. :

Myers’ no-nonsense approach to his
responsibilities as a member of the Ex-
ecutive Committee, combined with his
ability to refrain from speaking during the
heat of battles which sometimes occur on
Monday nights, is often deceiving to the
casual observer. Myers could say more,
But when he talks, people listen, and it’s
then easy to see that this junior member of
the EC is definitely an important part of
the committee.

Frank Smith — This sophomore member
of the EC usually concurs with the majori-
ty opinion of the committee and rarely
votes against proposals which ultimately
reflect the EC’s attitude. Although he does
not participate in discussions as much as
other members of the committee, Smith’s
comments are useful and necessary. He

. participated in the fact-finding committee

— along with Clark and Myers — that in-
vestigated alcohol abuse at W&L, and he is
often willing to serve on the numerous
committees which the EC sets-up to ex-
amine problems at the university. Smith is
a conscientious and dedicated member of
the committee.

Peter Baumgaertner — Like Smith, this
sophomore rarely finds himself in
disagreement with the majority of the
committee. His comments, although not as
frequent as Smith’s, usually reinforce an
opinion of other EC members. Baumgaert-
ner is capable of either bringing an issue
before the committee or offering sugges-
tions on issues introduced by other com-
mittee members. Unfortunately he does
not do this often enough. His opinions are

PETE BAUMGAERTNER

as valuable as those of other commitee
members. There is room in the next five
months for more contribution by
Baumgaertner.

Tripp Brower — There is very little that
can or should be said about this junior
member of the committee. Since the first
meeting of the year in September, Brower
has said almost nothing. Although he has
yet to miss a weekly meeting and he
always votes on matters that require com-
mittee approval, his input into committee
discussions is negligible. Perhaps his in-
volvement in the muscular dystrophy
dance marathon prevents him from
dedicating more time to the committee.

Ben Hale — It. would be unfair to judge
this freshman member of the committee
on his record to date since he has only been
on the EC since early November. But he
has exhibited some positive qualities as a

/new member, especially as an ear and

voice for the freshman class. In the past,

 

BEN HALE

the freshman class has been ignored, or at
least placed on the back burner, ‘‘to be
considered later.’’ But Hale has often
brought up matters of particular interest
and importance to the freshman class at
EC meetings. His concern about the man-
ner in which freshman elections are held
resulted in important changes and he ap-
pears to have a sincere interest in becom-
ing a real spokesman for the freshman
class.

A Look At:

Gary Fallon’s Playing Years

Note: This is the first in a
series of articles by Sports
Editor Ralph Frasca.

Several issues ago I wrote a
short piece on the distinct spar-
sity of W&L athletes who have
gone on to grace or trammel the
playing fields of the profes-
sional ranks. This paucity does
not, however, lend itself to the
rugged souls who constitute the
Physical Education  depart-
ment. Although none have ever
been remembered as bona fide
luminaries in the annals of pro-
fessional sports, five (Fallon,
Lyles, Emmer, McHenry, and
Williams) have grabbed at the
mythical brass ring of success
in a world of big men who get
paid to play little boy’s games.

Gary Fallon played college
football at Syracuse University,
when that school was in its
gridiron heyday. Fallon was a
two-way player during the
twilight years of that anti-
quated ‘‘old -school’’ style of
play, seeing action at fullback
on offense and linebacker on
defense.

‘‘We had some great teams at
Syracuse during the late 1950’s
and early 1960’s,"’ W&L’s foot-
ball coach recalls. ‘‘I played in
the same backfield as with one
of the greatest running backs
ever- Ernie Davis. That man
was amazing.”

Syracuse won the national
championship in 1959, and

many players on that team
became highly coveted by the
pros, particularly with the
emergence of the American
Football League in 1960. Com-
petition between the NFL and
AFL soon became fierce, as

both leagues fervently sought to
obtain the best talent available.

“I was pursued by teams in
both leagues, but the two which

showed the most interest were
the New York Giants of the
NFL, and the Dallas Cowboys of
the AFL. Being from New York,
I wanted to go with the Giants,
who were a great team back
then.”’

However, the Minnesota Vik-
ings, a second-year NFL expan-
sion club, drafted Fallon in the
12th round. Head Coach Norm
Van Brocklin, on the lookout for
running backs, saw Fallon play
in the Liberty Bowl and envi-
sioned him as a workhorse
fullback. Fallon respected Van
Brocklin, a reknowned quarter-
back of days gone by, but found
him to bea harsh taskmaster.

“The rookies and free agents
had to report to training camp a
week before the veterans, and
we were put through the most
rigorous workouts we had ever
experienced. It was like a meat
market, and it was all we could
do tosurvive.”’

When the veterans arrived,
the rookies thought that prac-
tices would ease up, but this
was not the case.

Van Brocklin was just as
tough on respected veterans
like Hugh McElhenny and Mel
Triplett as he was on us. The
funny thing is that McElhenny,
a former teammate of Van
Brocklin, said that Norm was
very slack during his playing
days, often scrimmaging in ber-
muda shorts. You see, back
when Van Brocklin played, the
defense wasn’t allowed to touch
the quarterback in practice.

Wrestlers Go Tonight

by John Harrison

At a point in which team suc-
cess will be marginal, the
Washington and Lee wrestling
team has found that its
schedule, in addition to some
bad breaks, will prevent the
situation from getting much
better.

Having recently lost three
members who quit the team,
W&L is presently in the middle
of the most demanding part of
its schedule, hosting two mat-
ches and a tournament in less
that four days. After the Lyn-
chburg meet last night, the
Generals square off against
Richmond tonight at 7:30 on.

On Saturday the team must
get up fairly early in order to
prepare for the 11 a.m. start of
the day-long W&L invitational.
The field includes three
Virginia schools (Hampden-
Sydney, Longwood and Lyn-
chburg), and four more from
North Carolina (Davidson,
Elon, Pfieffer and Catawba).
Then it’s on to Hampden-
Sydney for a match against the
Tigers next Tuesday.

In the aftermath of leaving
the team, junior Mike McFad-

den has decided to serve as an
assistant to coach Gary Franke.
His responsibilities include
overseeing the practices and
giving pointer to the team dur-
ing meets. Coach Franke ex-
plained, ‘‘Mike feels that he still
has a responsibility to the team.
I don’t believe he wanted to let
us down.”’

Fallon fended off stiff com-
petition and made the Vikings
as a crack special-teams player
and reserve fullback in the
backfield of a young quarter-
back named Fran Tarkenton.

“*Tark was a brilliant quarter-
back. Only in his 2nd year, he
had the poise of a veteran. Van
Brocklin let him run the of-
fense, which is rare for a
sophomore’ quarterback,
especially ona young team.”

Fallon was used sparingly in
1962, seeing occasional action
as a blocking and short-yardage
back on a team which was
almost exclusively comprised
of rookies and over-the-hill
stars of the previous decade.

“IT was forced to give 100%

with the Vikings because they

 

were always looking to replace
people. Every week I'd see new
faces in the locker room. It was
a pressure-filled situation in
which I was never made to feel
secure. I liked playing under
those conditions.”’

He was not invited back for
the following Season. Coach
Van Brocklin told Fallon that he
lacked speed, but praised him
for his gung-ho attitude and hus-
tle.

“T never had any delusions
about my ability,” Fallon
remarked. ‘I knew that I was a
fringe player, and it was just a
matter of time before I would
get cut.”

Fallon tried out for the Jets,
but found them overstocked in
running backs. Waiting for

Sports

another crack at the big time,
Fallon played semipro ball until
the Hamilton Tiger Cats of the
Canadian Football League sign-
ed him mid-way through the
1963 season.

They later released him, but
Fallon latched on with the
Toronto Argonauts, another
CFL team, largely due to the
recommendation of his ex-
coach, Norm Van Brocklin.

From 1965 to 1967, Fallon
played for several minor league
football teams, the last of which
was the Scranton(Pa.) Miners.

“The Miners were a farm
team of the New York Giants.
During the day I taught high
school, and at night I played
football.

“In 1968, the team moved to
New York City and became
much stricter in terms of prac-
tices. They wanted total com-
mittment from me, but I
couldn’t give it because of my
teaching position.”’

Fallon eventually landed a
coaching job at Princeton,
where he spent six years.

“‘Due to circumstances which
developed at Princeton, I felt it
was time to look for another job.
I had coached against Jack Em-
mer in the past, and knew that
he was at Washington and Lee.
The football head coaching posi-
_tion was open, and Jack recom-
mended that I interview for it.”’

Athletic Director Bill
McHenry was vacating the
post, which worried Fallon.

“I was afraid that Bill, my
boss and the outgoing coach,
would constantly second-guess
me. Fortunately, that has not
been the case. He’s been great,
and lets me run the team my
way,” Fallon said.

Fallon recalled these anec-
dotes.

The Cowboys played the Vik-
ings in a scrimmage game, and
I was at fullback. We ran a pass
play in which I was to block
their middle linebacker, Jerry
Tubbs, if he rushed for the
quarterback. If he laid back, I
was to look for someone else to
block. Well, on the play he
didn’t charge, so I started look-

ing to pick up another defender. |
As soon as I turned, though, he
rushed in and nailed our
quarterback. Van _ Brocklin
really chewed me out for that
one! He sent me back in later,
when we were running the exact
same play. Determined not to
be folled, I watched for Tubbs,
He wasn’t coming. But as I
started to turn, I saw him
charge out of the corner of my
eye. I turned back and tackled
him. Tubbs was furious, but I
told him, ‘Hey, I just got chew-
ed out because of you, and I
wasn’t going to let you fool me
again.’ ‘In the pros, they don’t
care how you do your job, just
that you do it.”’

During the mid-1960’s, Fallon
played in the Syracuse U. Alum-
ni football game, against the
varsity, where he faced a young
fullback named Larry Csonka.

“I was playing linebacker in
that game, and at one point
Csonka broke loose running
down the sideline, and I was the
last defender in his path to the
goal line. Csonka wasn’t very
agile, he just tried to run over
defenders. Well, I managed to
tackle him around the legs,
Csonka was hopping mad, and
he remembered me for that.

“At the alumni game the
following year, Csonka and I
found ourselves in the exact
same situation — a one-on-one
in which I was the only one in
his way to a touchdown. Csonka
had developed a little head fake
since our last meeting, which
faked me out of my socks and
had me leaning the other way.
Seeing that I was off-balance,
Csonka ran over me and scored
the touchdown.”

Fallon, head coach at W&L
since 1978, holds a great deal of
respect for his ballplayers.

‘‘None of my boys are pro pro-
spects, and they get little
recognition for their
achievments on the football
field. I respect the fact that they
play because they want to, not
because they have to because of
an athletic scholarship.”

Next week- Jack Emmer and the
New York Jets.

Swim Team Loses Two Meets

by Phil Murray
The Washington and Lee
swimming team was defeated
twice last weekend, losing to
James Madison University on
Friday, 60-43, and Towson State
University, 74-38, the following

day.
While both schools compete in
Division I, Coach Page

Remillard did not believe that
either team had better swim-
mers than the Generals. “Their
people simply swam a lot better
on those days,” remarked the
second-year aquatics director.
In fact, several W&L swim-
mers turned in season high

marks but were beaten by
outstanding performances by
the JMU and Towson athletes.

Freshman Tim Rock con-
tinued his remarkable success
with the best dual meet times in
the 200-yd freestyle in the
Madison meet and in the 599-
and 1000-yd free against
Towson.

Versatile co-captain Herb
Gresens clocked a_ personal
high in the 200-yd fly versus
Towson, while Eric Peterson
earned a personal best as well
in the 50-yd free.

One of the most pleasant sur-

prises for coach Remillard this
season has been the performace
of freshman diver Richard
Rosser. ‘‘Richard has provided
us with strength we didn’t know
we had.”

But Remillard was quick to
give credit to diving coach-
JoAnn Jordan who has turned
Rosser into a top competitor
after she discovered him diving
recreationally at W&L. Rosser

finished first in the 3-meter dive
and second in the 1-meter dive

against Towson.

Remillard was not discourag-
ed by the defeats, which drop-

ped the dual meet record to 2-3.

A lack of depth has forced the
Generals to place more em-
phasis on individual achieve-
ment than team success.
Several swimmers have
already qualified for the NCAA
Division III Championships to
be held March 19-21 in Oberlin,
Ohio.

The Generals will host their
final home meet Saturday at 2
p.m. against Shepherd College
in the Cy Twombly pool. Coach
Remillard hopes to see a lot of
support for W&L’s fine swim-
ming team. As an added attrac-
tion, the Sweetbriar swim team
will face the Shepherd women.

contests he has started this
season, netting 22 points in the
Emory & Henry game and 17
points in the Generals’ 93-79 win
over Bridgewater on Jan. 17.
Still, New did not put together
his most impressive perfor-
mance until Tuesday night.
New led his team with a game-
high 26 points against Roanoke,
including 14 in the first half, as
WA&L struggled to a 39-32 deficit.
“In the first half, we didn’t
follow our game plan,”’ stressed
Canfield. ‘In the second half,
we followed it beautifully. In the
first half on offense, we would
beat the press but then let up. In
the second half, we would at
tack after beating the press.”
“Defensively, we kept them
to outside shots,” continued the
coach, ‘‘and didn’t allow them

to get into the middle.”
The second half statistics for
W&L are incredible. The

Generals shot 74 percent from
the field, scoring on 32 of 41
second half possessions At one
point, W&L scored on 15
straight possessions. And

is W&L’s second-half point total

Senior center Rob Smither-
man scored 22 points and grabb-
ed nine rebounds while junior
guard George Spears pumped
in 19 points and handed off ten
assists. Senior co-captain Carby
Hoy added 14 points for the
Generals.

Said Canfield: ‘“‘We are not
playing with a great bench; we
are basically relying on five
players. But while I can’t single
out any one player, Spears’ free
throws down the line were
critical. At that point, our oppo-
nent was not Roanoke but the
clock.”’

On the night, Spears hit 13 of
14 free throw attempts.

Asked if his team was peak-
ing now, Canfield replied that
his team has been playing well
the entire month. Canfield said
he hopes to avoid that problem,
adding: “I would fight any
signs of peaking this early.”

The Generals will face
another major test tonight when
they travel to Lynchburg to
take on the Hornets. Gametime
is 8 p.m. at Lynchburg College.

An Insider’s Guide To:

W&L’s Fencing Program

by Leigh Kaplan
Sports Editor’s note: Leigh
Kaplan is a sophomore fencer for

WEL.

A sport rarely mentioned on
campus is the W&L fencing
team. Few have more than a
layman’s_ knowledge of the

sport, fewer still have attended
a fencing meet. Hence, this in-

troductory article, in the same

vein as Ralph Frasca’s piece
earlier in the year.

Fencing existed at W&L
throughout the twentieth cen-
tury, but did not gain pro-
minence until 1941, when Tad
Humphries, now Fencing Coach
at VMI, was captain of the
team. In 1943, the team
dissolved due to the World War
II draft. Afterwards, various at-
tempts to reorganize a fencing
team failed until 1977, when a
serious and successful attempt
was made by Dr. Jim Worth,
W&L’s Psychological Adviser.

Worth’s desire to resurrect
the team stems from a genuine
desire to teach the art of fencing
and introduce the sport to in-
terested students. Dr. Worth
commented, “Fencing has a
swashbuckling quality, a
romantic aspect which at the
same time is quite aggressive.
Worth went on to say that he
liked fencing for its one-on-one
competition and emphasized
the fact that skill instead of
physical strength is requisite
for the sport. Analyzing fencing
in-depth, Dr. Worth feels the
sport ‘‘teaches winning, mental
discipline, courage, and ego
development. To sum it up, one
learns to compete.”

Worth offered an interesting
reaction to the nagging con-
troversy surrounding the pro-
spect of fencing entering the
ranks of varsity sports.

“T would like to try varsity

. Status,’”’ Worth remarked.
‘Although it would give up our
autonomy, we would have the
benefits and notoriety which ac-
company a varsity sport.”

Unless the fencing
achieves recognition,

team
some

team members fear dissolution
is imminent, particularly when
one considers

the sparse

    
  

It is time to place
your orders for
caps, gowns and

freshman crop of swordsmen.
Team captain Bill Sherwin
commented, ‘‘The team’s
chances for survival are good,
but we've got to recruit.

Recruiting is essential.’’

Asked how he would try to
recruit, Sherwin remarked,
‘“‘We need to present a fencing
exhibition before the student
body to illustrate the  in-
tricacies, quickness, concentra-
tion, and actual excitement in-
volved in this sport. If people
are interested, they should sign
up and try it out to see if they

"ike it. Another thing that might

help is to put up a few more
posters, advertise on radio. In
essence, we need a_ broad
publicity base.”’

Student sentiment regarding
the fencing team proved in-
teresting. One student with
whom. one shouldn’t ‘“‘mintz’’
words growled, ‘The fencing
team gets too much money
from the E.C.”’ Another student
commented, ‘‘Before I came to
W&L, I had never seen a fenc-
ing meet. I knew little about the
sport. For instance, I did not
know that such divisions as foil,
epee, or sabre existed.’’ One
freshmen said, ‘‘I would rather
see the fencing team remain in-
dependent than to become a
varsity sport. The fencers enjoy.
a certain freedom that varsity
status can not offer. For in-
stance, the ‘‘competitive edge”’
coaches look for in athletes
comes out naturally, instead of
from fear of being cut from the
team.”’

A number of students praised
the fact that muscle is not a fac-
tor in fencing, as opposed to vir-

at W&L. Rather, agility is the:
requisite attribute in fencing, a
fact that makes the sport so ap-
pealing to those who feel that
muscles do not necessarily
denote athletic prowess.

In fencing, three weapons are
used: epee, foil, and sabre. In
epee, accuracy is most impor-
tant; foil requires movement;
sabre mandates quickness.
Skills needed in all three
weapons are among others, con-
centration and proper form.
The object of the sport is to hit
the opponent five times within a
certain time limit. All fencing
must be done within a boundary
called a “‘fencing strip.” If one
strays outside of the fencing
strip three times, a point penal-
ty must be called.

When questioned about the
team’s prospects this season,
Bill Sherwin said, ‘‘We did beat
U.Va. for the first time since
our team’s inception in 1977, but
we should not anticipate an
easy time or an obvious win
against such upcoming op-
ponents as George Mason and
William and Mary.”’ Bill quick-
ly pointed out that, “‘On a good
day, we can beat anyone. Much
depends on mental attitude.”’

The W&L fencing team will
meet VMI and VPI at the lat-
ter’s school.

The Generals take on Duke
and George Mason on Feb. 7 at
VMI, starting time 1:00. Final-
ly, the Virginia State Cham-
pionships will be held at W&L
on Feb. 21. Dave Hepler, W&L’s
reigning state champion in epee
fencing will defend his title
against the state’s best fencers.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Dart Guns?

“The Killer Game”’ It’s hard not to be sarcastic
when we talk about a game in which people stalk
around shooting at one another with dart guns — all
for a cash prize. Though it sounds like something
from the gong show, there are posters all over cam-
pus advertising ‘‘the Killer Game”’ with the endorse-
ment for fairness that the honor system applies to the
playing of the game. The statement understandably

raised a few eyebrows on the Executive Committee -

and was the subject of considerable discussion during
the EC’s Monday night meeting.

Like the EC, we wonder why it was necessary for
the honor system to be mentioned at all. The Honor
System should pervade all aspects of student life at
Washington and Lee, so it really is not necessary to
mention that honor applies to the playing of a dart
game. Saying the honor system applies in this in-
stance almost infers that it does not apply in other
situations. The game is trivial and foolish, and for
that reason it does not seem right for a poster adver-
tising the game to endorse itself with the honor

system.

The EC was in a bad spot in that it was hard to say
that the system does not apply, yet it seemed absurd
to say that it does apply. We applaud the decision

Tuesday, January 20, will certainly go down in the
history books as a big day in American history — how
many countries in the world could change leaders and
end an international crisis on the same day? It may
sound corny, but we should pause and reflect on just
how good we have it as Americans, and how lucky we

are to be spending four years at a fairly peaceful
school.

You Can't
Keep A Good

Man Down

Dear Editor:

Poor Mr. Johnson! It’s a
credit to him that he was able to
win a Rhodes in spite of
Washington and Lee. The lesson
is clear: Not even W&L,
“‘violently’’ opposed to research
as it is (violently?) and hiring
liars to work in the admissions
office, can keep a truly good
man down. What he forgot to
mention is how the administra-
tion also wouldn’t let him
transfer out when he discovered
all this.

Sincerely,
Bob Keefe

s Scholar

Responds To Johnson

Dear Editor:

As a 1978 graduate of
Washington and Lee and a 1977
recipient of a Rhodes Scholar-
ship, I would like to respond to
your interview with Ed
Johnson.

Treasurer Explains
Phantom Accounts

Dear Editor:

I would like to make a few ex-
planatory comments regarding
your January 16 story on mid-
term reports. I was not able to
attend the meeting because my
fraternity held elections that
night.

My purpose in drafting the
midyear report was primarily
to present receipts and expen-
ditures since the last report,
since I felt a complete review of
all transactions to date would
be both time-wasting and

redundant. I did include an ac- .

counting of total expenditures
of each account to date. The EC
ad-hoc member to the SAB con-
curred with me on this, but un-
fortunately, this was not
brought out at the meeting.
Therefore, the failure to list
receipts from one of our films,
which had appeared on the
previous report.

Regarding the drawing of
funds from apparently ‘‘emp-
ty” accounts: according to EC
Vice-President Willie Mackie,
standard procedure has been to
deposit EC funds into one
account and the SAB has been
free to allocate funds as it

wishes among its four accounts.
The writing of checks from
three accounts shows up as a
negative balance on the Univer-
sity’s accounting system,
balanced out, however, by the
single large deposit. Mackie
merely wished to insure that we
had allocated funds among the
accounts, since he has no other
way to verify this other than
directly questioning the SAB, I
would like to note, however,
that the amount we have
allocated for each account ap-
pears on every budget report.
Although I can understand
EC President Bob Willis’ con-
cern about financial review; in
the case of the SAB, every
transaction made appears on
our monthly report, although
minute items are often com-
bined for expediency. I would
be perfectly happy to let the EC
examine our books, if it wishes,
as I am Satisfied as to the ac-
curacy of our records and their
correlation to our monthly
report.
Sincerely,
Larry Wescott
Treasurer
Student Activities Board

First of all, I hope that many
of his comments were either
misquoted or distorted, I first
met him a week ago and he
seemed to be not only very
bright but also very nice. But if
his remarks were not taken out
of context, a strong reply is in
order.

I would term my liberal arts
education at W&L particularly
in History, German, Sociology
and Art as first-rate. In fact, I
believe that my education at
W&L was better than the one I
received from Oxford. For a
small, private university we
need not apologize to anyone for
our faculty, facilities, course
selection, or our student body.

Sure, there are areas in which
W&L could improve and every
man is entitled to his opinion on
this subject. But one also owes a
debt to the university which
gave him both his training and
the backing to win a prestigious
post-graduate scholarship. In
short, not only must a man be
incredibly lucky to win a
Rhodes but he also must apply
out of an institution which has
the required prestige ' and
recognition.

Harvard sends over 150 ap-
plicants a year into the Rhodes
competition. W&L does not even
send a fraction of that number
in five years of competition.
Yet, W&L has won four Rhodes
Scholarships in the past nine
years. No other comparable
school in the U.S. has done bet-
ter. It would seem; then, that
Washington and Lee must be
doing something right.

Yours most respectfully,
Mark A. Bradley ’78
‘Killer

Game’

Dear Editor:

Okay, I understand that the
“Ist Annual W&L Killer Game”’
is just that — a game. However,
it pains me to think that such an
activity could reduce our
awareness of the lives lost
because of the senseless use of
handguns. Thousands of people
in the U.S., including such
talents as John Lennon and Dr.
Michael Halberstam, were
shooting victims in 1980. There
is little chance of handgun con-
trol legislation in the new Con-
gress, but we could at least
begin to recognize the menace
of handguns by refraining from
the ‘Killer Game.”’

Johnson Article, Editorial Criticized

Dear Editor:

After reading the editorial in
last week’s edition of the Ring-
tum Phi, I was tempted to write
to each of the Rhodes Scholar-
ship committees in the nation in
order to inform them that they
wasted their time rigorously
assessing the qualifications of
each of this year’s Rhodes
Scholarship applicants. The
committees merely should have
forwarded all applications to
John G. Billmyre, the editor-in-
chief of the Ring-tum Phi. It
seems that via some unknown
process Mr. Billmyre is able to
determine just who is and who
is not ‘Rhodes Scholarship
material.”

Needless to say at this point, I
was not very pleased with the
tone of Mr. Billmyre’s editorial.
Nor was I pleased with Mr.
Whalen’s story about Ed
Johnson. I must admit that Ed
Johnson will never make a fine
diplomat (or even a mediocre
one); however, I must assert
that Mr. Whalen’s unfairness
both in what he chose to print
and in what he chose not to
print.

First, I question why Mr.

ae

GE EE LE IT LS LD ITO LE FF MF MF LL LL

Whalen believes that Mr.
Johnson’s office on the first
floor of Parmly Hall is isolated
from the university. It is, after
all, located less than fifty yards
from the new library, which is
supposedly the center of cam-
pus intellectual life. That Mr.
Whalen believes the office to be
“isolated from the rest of the
university” indicates that he
has certain prejudices concern-
ing which persons and places
contribute most to campus life.
Perhaps he allowed those pre-
judices to influence his repor-
ting.

Second, Mr. Johnson and I
discussed the story the day it
appeared in the Phi. In our con-
versation, Mr. Johnson told me
that in many instances Mr.
Whalen had paraphrased his
comments rather than quoted
them. Moreover, it seems that
Mr. Whalen was guilty of omit-
ting some rather important
points that Mr. Johnson made. I
will complete one quotation of
which only a portion was includ-
ed in the Phi: ‘‘...] was taken in
by all the liberal arts bullsh-t

—and I still am.” The fact that
Mr. Whalen chose not to com-

plete the quotation suggests to
me that he was more interested

_in sensational reporting than in

accurate reporting.

Third, Rhodes Scholars do not
attend Cambridge. They attend
Oxford. (Mr. Johnson, in fact,
gave his interviewer a pam-
phlet about Oxford.) Further-
more, Mr. Johnson is not from
Natchez, Alabama as reported
by Mr. Whalen; he is from
Huntsville. It seems that Mr.
Whalen only bothered to listen
to Mr. Johnson when something
that might provide sensationa!
print for the Phi was being
discussed.

I would like to add one final
comment. My opinions concern-
ing W&L and life in general are
vastly different from Mr.
Johnson’s. However, I
recognize that he is an extreme-
ly intelligent, knowledgeable
person; one who is perhaps
capable of making a significant
contribution to physics. Ap-
parently, the members of the
Rhodes Scholarship commit-

tees that interviewed Mr.
Johnson agree with me.

Sincerely,

Paul Bourdon

LEE OST NA MOE EST MMMM

Editor’s note
Mr. Bourdon picked up two

points which | missed while
editing Bill) Whalen’s interview
with Ed Johnson. One, Johnson
lives on Natchez Drive in Hunts-
ville, Alabama, though he lists his
home address in the student
directory as Lexington. Second,
Johnson will study Physics at Ox-
ford, not Cambridge.

However, | stand behind Bill
Whalen’s article 100 percent and
would like to point out that-
Johnson did not make the state-
ment, “Twas taken in by all the
liberal arts bull-sh--t--and 1 still
am,” in his interview with Bill
Whalen. He may have wished that
he made that comment after the
interview, but Bill Whalen’s notes
show clearly that he did not
paraphrase Johnson and that he
followed his notes accurately. In
fact, Whalen’s story represents
well the comments Johnson made.
Whalen did include
some of the most: embarassing
comments: our Rhodes’ Scholar
made, In conelusion Td like to
add a quip printed in the Wall
Street Journal last year: “Most of
the people who claim to have been

nol

misquoted are merely sorry they
said it,”

Dear Sir,

This letter is adressed to
Jamie Small, one of the men in
charge of our student activities
board. Weren't the busboys sup-
posed to play in the Cockpit
from 8 til 10 on Tuesday night?
Click, Click. Some of us really
wanted to see them at 8; we
made plans one it, counted on
it; and no delivery. So, while I
sat and drank for the two hours
you caused me to waste, I was
treated to the sight of the band
drinking right behind me. I
guess they were waiting for a
crowd, huh? |

Lastly, contrary to your state-
ment announcing the change in
the schedule of the show, I don’t
think I got any more for my
money than I would have gotten
had the show gone on as you
advertised. The whole thing
really sucked wind. And I ran
out of beer money as a result.
Fortunately the band was well
worth the wait. We would like to

see them again; on time.

Textbook Prices Will Keep Rising,
Many Factors Contribute

by Dave Dallam

By all current indicators, the
prices of textbooks will continue
to rise dramatically, as they
have been doing over the past
three years, according to Betty
Munger, manager of the
Washington and Lee bookstore.
Increased publishing costs have

frequent editions of revised
texts, and the customary offer-
ing of discounts are other major
contributing factors. Unfor-
tunately, the bookstore is not in
a position to ameliorate these
circumstances, since, even
when it buys books sold at net
prices — prices marked down

   

The cost of new textbooks continues to rise.

dustry, which has effectively
passed them on to the student in
the form of steadily increasing
prices.

Inflation is not the sole cause
of price increases; increased
computerization in printing, the

Fraternity leaders met Tues-
day evening in a continued at-

posed by Lexington’s noise or-

Interfraternity Council Presi-

two courses of action: 1) work-
ing to extend the hours which
fraternities are allowed to play
amplified music to 1 a.m. in
return for pledges by fraternity
presidents to adhere more
strictly to the ordinance; 2) con-
test the violations in court.

from the normal retail rate to a
“library rate, which usually
amounts to a 20 percent
decrease — it must resell those
books with a markup of about 30
percent.’ Although such a
percentage increase may seem
unwarranted, Mrs. Munger con-

Sigma Chi President Nelson
Ould said that he has discussed
the matter with Eric Sisler, a
local attorney, who suggested
that if fraternities would
develop a ‘“‘more agreeable
plan” to replace the present ci-
ty ordinance he would present
such a plan to the City Council.

Phi Delta Theta President
Hill McAlister said that he
thought it would be futile to
work with the police to revise
the noise permits. ‘‘We have to
change the law as opposed to
just changing the permit hours,

tends that it barely allows her
operation to break even; it must
pay for staff salaries, accoun-
ting and recording materials,
and shipping of the books
themselves.

Many students have sought
financial refuge from the
phenomenon by buying used
books. According to Slisby M.
Jennelle, National sales
manager for Wallace’s College
Book Company, the youngest
and most rapidly growning
buyer and seller of used college
textbooks in the United States, a
thriving market exists for used
texts. Mr. Jennelle’s company
operates by sending represen-
tatives to campus bookstores
around the country to collect
books of current value — that is,
books which have a great poten-
tial for resale in the broad
market. The representative
gives the student approximate-
ly 25 percent of retail price for
those books which he considers
to be of resale quality:
books which are intact without
extensive markings. The com-
pany then ships the books back
to its warehouse in Lexington,
Kentucky, where they await
reshipment.

Jennelle says that Wallace’s,

(See TEXTBOOK, page 9)

the permit is virtually wor-
thless,’’ he said.

Holt Merchant, the IFC’s
faculty advisor, agreed that the
IFC can “‘petition”’ the city coun
cil, but cautioned fraternities
to “be nice to them, be
reasonable, negotiate with
them’’ rather than “‘outrage’’
them as he said former Ex-
ecutive Committee President
Beau Dudley did two years ago.

Merchant suggested that the
IFC enlist the aid of Executive
Committee Representative and
law student Jeff Edwards in the

Law Students Question Bridge Safety

by Tom Baker

Bad lighting on the footbridge
between Doremus Gymnasium
and Wilson Field has students
who use the bridge concerned.

Mike Nogay, the first year
law representative to the Ex-
ecutive Committee, has com-
plained at several EC meetings
that the lighting receptacles on
the footbridge, put in about two
years ago, are spaced too far
apart to do an adequate job of
lighting the bridge. Many law
students, especially women liv-
ing in Baker Dormitory who fre-

quently use the bridge at night,
have told Nogay that the
lighting is unsafe and could in-
vite unfortunate incidents;
although no students have ex-
perienced any serious problems
up to this point.

Bob Willis, EC President, is
looking into the situation and is
going to present these problems
to the administration.

The administration, however,
has already taken steps to cor-
rect the situation. James L. Ar-
thur, the superintendent of

buildings and grounds, explain-
ed that on the night of January
14, he and several other univer-
sity officials toured the campus
to view the lighting system. Mr.
Arthur, Frank Parsons, Assis-
tant to the President, E.
Stewart Epley, the University
Treasurer, and Tom Burrill, the
campus landscaper, took note
of the situation on the foot-
bridge and directed Burrill to
put together a plan correcting
the lighting situation, which he
is in the process of doing now.

private residence since 1970. All
fraternities are required to ob-
tain a permit before moving in-
to any of Lexington’s zoning
districts.

The fraternity was
represented by Washington and
Lee law student Bruce Myers,
who is director of an alumni
organization called New House
Corp. that is assisting the Kap-
pa Sigma chapter. Myers
acknowledged a ‘‘shocking lack
of concern’”’ for neighbors that
typifies fraternities but said
social activities would be close-
ly monitored by local alumni
and a house mother. He said
that local ordinances would be
abided by and that abuse of the
premises would not be
tolerated.

Myers presented five officers
of the new chapter whom he
praised for ‘‘trying to be good
citizens’ and for their involve-
ment in various school ac-
tivities and community ser-
vices. Myers said the students
were at the top of their respec-

tive classes.

A three-year-old honor case
involving a law student at the
University of Virginia was
dropped last week, ending one
of the longest cases in the 139-
year history of the UVa. Honor
+ Committee.

The defendant in the case,
Josh Henson of Falls Church,
Va., had gone through tw»
honor trials and had been ex:
pecting to appear in an un-
precedented third trial this

year. Henson was found guilty
in previous trials.

The incident occured in
September of 1977 when Hen-
son, who was President of the
Association of Student Interna-
tional Law Studies at UVa., was
accused of stealing a moot court
competition problem from the
desk of his organization’s ex-
ecutive secretary.

Henson was accused by
Michael Salovaara, a_ 1980

graduate of the law school.
After the case was dropped,
Henson enrolled in the law
school to complete his gradua-
tion requirements. Henson will
be able to receive a degree as
soon as he completes his course
work, said school officials.

Mike Baughan, chairman of
the Honor Committee, refused
to give anydetails as to why the
case was dismissed. Earlier,
Baughan had received letters

 

from Henson and his accuser.

dation of Dallas.

The foundation made a
similar grant to the 1980 W&L
convention.

The W&L event, which is
organized strictly by students,
seeks to predict the Presiden-
tial nominee for the party out of
the White House, well in ad-
vance of the actual national
nominating conventions, With a
record of 12 correct predictions
in 17 attempts, it is historically
the most accurate such affair at
any college, and is also widely

regarded as one of the most
realistic.

The Summers Foundation,
established in 1949, makes gifts
to scholarship endowments and
to higher education institutions
and educational organizations
in general.

Watching the students’ Mock
Republican Convention _ last
May from the VIP balcony, one
of the Summers Foundation
trustees, Judge Charles E. Long
Jr. of Dallas, said: ‘Every
dollar we gave these men has
been seen in the work they’ve
put out. This is really practical
politics — and I love it prac-
tical!’’

EC Examines Whitebook For Revisions

by Bill Whalen

The Executive Committee ap-
pointed a sub-committee for a
possible revision of the
Whitebook at Monday night’s
hour-long session.

Following a move initially
started by Senior Represen-
tative Jim Vines earlier this
year, President Bob Willis
declared that parts of the
Whitebook do not ‘read fluid-
ly,” and should be reviewed by
a committee.

Following Willis’ statement,
the EC broke into disagreement
over the special committee’s
composition. Several members
also questioned this commit-
tee’s role.

“We should set up a commit-
tee to look at general headings
and get wording in the right
place,” said Willis. ‘“‘An over-
view should be taken and some
of the material should be con-
solidated.”’

Willis cited one part of the
Whitebook which deals with the
rights of an accused party in an
honor violation as an example
of sloppy writing. ‘“You will find
a section for the rights of the ac-
cused,” said Willis, ‘“‘and it is
repeated in the procedural sec-
tion.”

EC Vice-President Willy
Mackie furthered Willis’ argu-
ment one step, claiming that -w

urpose of a special committee
should be to examine both the
“stylistic” and ‘substantive’
parts of the Whitebook. The
discussion of the role of such a
committee ended when the EC
debated the actual make-up of
the proposed committee.

Senior Representative Mar-
shall Clark raised two points,
stating that the committee
should consist of people not on
the EC and then concluding that
the committee would only act
according to “their own writing
style and (their opinion of) what
should or should not be in the
Whitebook.”’

Third Year Law Represen-
tative Jeff Edwards jumped in-
to the argument, claiming that
there are enough changes need-
ed to be made in the Whitebook
that “if every person brought
one in, we would be here for two
weeks.”’ The discussion took a
pivotal turn when Jim Vines
questioned if faculty members
would be allowed on the revi-
sions committee.

Mackie argued that faculty
members should not be includ-
ed on the committee, though
they would be allowed to ex-
press their opinions.

Wiilis attempted to clear the
air by stating that the EC
should appoint three of its own
members to decide how the
committee will be made up.

Freshman representative
Ben Hale moved that the EC ap-
point a subcommittee con-
sisting of three EC members
and three students-at-large to
review the Whitebook. The mo-
tion passed, with Vines dissen-
ting because of omission of
faculty members on the propos-
ed committee.

In an effort to include some
form of faculty representatives
on the committee, Willis moved
that the EC also include “‘ad-
ministrators’” on the commit-
tee. The resolution passed, 7-5.

In explaining why he had
earlier voted against the move
to form a revision committee,
Vines first stated his belief that
faculty members should be in-
cluded on the committee, then
asked that his original dissen-
ting vote be changed.

Following the original 10-1
vote to form a committee, Vines
then proposed that the EC add
two faculty members who were
graduated from W&L. This
measure was defeated, but the
“administrator” version pro-
posed by Willis was passed later
in its place.

Prometheus

Killer At Large

My trenchcoat fluttered in the breeze. I was hiding, furtively,

_behind the newspaper. The class bell rang; soon, soon I would fulfill

my contract. I gripped the cold, hard plastic with my right hand. A
tremor seized my body. Yes, it was the distinct feeling of power,
and I held it in my fingertips. Power and I were alone. Power and I
would win.

I had stayed up all night studying my victim’s habits, class
schedule, family life, and high school activities. I knew him as well
as I knew myself. He was an animal; I was the hunter. The blood,
the blood. I craved victory.

I clipped the yellow rubber-tipped dart into the cool, hard, plastic
gun. The click sent a surge of anxiety through my heavy limbs. It
wasn’t a feeling of remorse, just emptiness. I knew my victim so
well I felt I would be killing a part of myself. None of this pathetic
foolishness, though, I thought to myself. I am an assassin. This is no
game; this is KILLER. (Dum de dum dum).

I studied the black and white glossy photograph one last time and
slid the evidence deep into the classified section of the paper. There
he was; an unknowing prep walking closer, closer, closer now. But
he stopped. He stopped and studied the bulletin board. Now is the
time. Now is the time. I walked up and shot him nobly in the back of
the head. ‘“‘Dead. Dead. You’re dead,’’ I shouted. I shouted. I
screamed in triumphant joy. ‘“‘Hand over your assignment; let me
caress the negative.” He did so, benumbed by my stealthy attack.

I walked the Collonade in a euphoric bliss. I had scored. My

yellow, rubber-tipped dart had done its work. I was an assassin.

The blur of success was tantalizing, blinding. Then, dum de dum
dum, I too was hunted. A yellow dart flew by my left ear. A miss. I
turned, ran, aware of my assassin’s pursuit. I heard the click; a
surge of anxiety assailed my heavy limbs. The thump resounded in
my ears, but I had swallowed the photo. No evidence, now. No

 

assassin would beat me.

 

 

Henneman Will Replace Schildt As Assistant Dean At Law School

Edward O. Henneman, assis-
tant- professor of law at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, will become assistant dean
of the School of Law on August
1. The announcement was made -

Surprising ‘Popeye’

Shiver Me Timbers,
It’s Not That Bad

by John Wells

Popeye, a Christmas release which opens at the
State Theater on Friday, is a visually humorous,
though often inconsistent film representing a ma-
jor switch on the part of its director, Robert
Altman, and the execution of comic-book based
pictures altogether.

Critics and audiences have not been very kind to
Mr. Altman in the past few years. Although he has

 

Film Review

 

turned out more movies than most of his contem-
poraries since 1975, most of them have either been
very bad or labeled very bad by everybody from
Vincent Canby to Rona Barrett. Big budget pic-
tures with major stars fizzled. Buffalo Bill and the
Indians and Quintet, both with Paul Newman, and
the all-star A Wedding — as well as more modest
productions such as The Perfect Couple.His most
recent project, HEALTH, with Lauren Bacall,
Ruth Gordon and James Garner, is collecting dust
on a shelf somewhere, never released.

Most of the critics have nailed Altman again for
his departure to what must be called musical fan-
tasy, Popeye. I would say the major faults are
these: an occasionally sluggish pace, especially in
some of the musical numbers, and a tendency to
squeeze some gags for all they’re worth. It is so
different it cannot be intelligently compared to
Altman’s major works of the past.

 

The most charming features of Popeye are the
performers and the cartoon-like settings. In fact,
Popeye is nothing more than a living cartoon; all
of the characters are humorously decked out with
distorted big feet and other appendages, and the
locale is a decaying old sea town built in Malta for
20th Century-Fox. It looks like a stack of 1930s
comic books come to life.

The actors handle themselves with thoughtful
control. It would have been a mistake to make the
characters anything but the one-dimensional
figures they are and they or Altman realized this.

As unAmerican as it might sound, I have never
been a Mork and Mindy fan even though |
acknowledge Robin Williams’ unique talents.
Popeye is really no more than a sustained
characterization for him and he, like the rest of
the cast, used the old Paramount cartoon features
for his model. The resulting gruff voice and
distorted demeanor are consistent with
everything else but are drawbacks due to a) sheer
tiresomeness and b) the fact that his lines, spoken
and sung, are often difficult to understand.

Shelly Duvall has worked with few directors
other than Altman since she debuted in his Three
Women several years ago. Her Olive Oy] is skinny
with enormous feet and a whiney, fretful manner
which one associates with the animated cartoon.
About the only difference is her physical inability
to make her arms, legs and neck stretch like rub-

ber (See, POPEYE, page 12)

Film Notes —

 

 

 

North by Northwest (1959) Alfred Hitchcock directed this fast-
paced contemporary thriller for M-G-M, casting Cary Grant as the
ordinary guy caught up in a bizarre set of circumstances. It’s ex-
citing and often quite funny, with chills as Grant flees from a killer
crop-dusting plane out west somewhere and, with Eva Marie Saint,
darting about the faces of Mount Rushmore. A lavish production
with pretension apparent only in some of Eva Marie Saiut’s haute
wardrobe (a bustle on one dress, please). Otherwise Hitchcock was
at his entertaining best. With James Mason, Leo G. Carroll and
Josephine Hutchinson. Shown by the Journalism Department on
Tuesday, Feb. 2 at 7 and 9 p.m. in Reid 203. Admission is free.

 

 

NRBQ Slated For Performance in Cockpit

NRBQ (who will perform in
the Cockpit, Wednesday Feb. 4)
has been praised by critics as
one of the most enjoyable, ec-
centric, ‘and unpretentious
bands in America. Many have
tried to label NRBQ and all
have failed. As James Isaacs of
Boston’s The Real Paper notes,
“One cannot categorize the
music of NRBQ except to note
that it thrives on the unexpected
and is consistently superb.”

What does NRBQ stand for?
Born as the New Rhythm ‘N’
Blues Quartet, NRBQ music is a
combination of R&B, Swing,
Rockabilly, and straight-ahead,
down-to-earth Rock ‘N’ Roll.
The members of the group con-
tinue to write new songs in all of
the above styles, blended and
presented with some of the most
arresting and inventive jazz im-
provisation happening today.
NRBQ is indeed all of these
things and much more; it’s
nothing if not eclectic. One
writer summed up the breadth
of an NRBQ set, as follows:

“For diversity of music, it’s
hard to top NRBQ. Besides
original material, their sets in-
clude rockabilly..., jazz..., and
when the mood strikes, the

theme song from ‘I Love
Lucy’!’: The originals of Terry
Adams, bassist Joe Spam-
pinato, and guitarist Al Ander-
son have the same directness
and vitality that characterize
the early, vibrant rock ‘n’ roll of

Buddy Holly and Little
Richard.”
Who comprises NRBQ?

NRBQ is a Quartet with a Plus.
On keyboards and sometimes
lead vocals is the co-originator
of NRBQ. TERRY ADAMS,
also known for his work with the
Carla Bley Band. On lead guitar
and gutsy, driving rock ‘n’ roll
vocals is BIG AL ANDERSON.
At Terry’s right hand is bassist,
another occasional lead singer,
and co-originator of the band
JOEY SPAMPINATO. TOM
ARDOLINO adds the drive and
ever-present beat that rounds
out the Quartet.

NRBQ’s ‘‘Plus’’ is’ the
WHOLE WHEAT HORNS.
DONN ADAMS, Terry’s
brother, is on trombone. While
KEITH SPRING is the band’s
regular on tenor sax, GARY
WINDO of the Carla Bley Band
is also a frequent guest. The
WHOLE WHEAT HORNS work
integrally with the QUARTET

i hh 2
on virtually all arrangements.
Together, NRBQ with the
WHOLE WHEAT HORNS is
creating and performing some

of the most engaging and enter-
taining rock music around to-
day. What’s more, NRBQ is a
group whose individual musi-

 

cians have never lost the joy
and love of playing.

New Rhythm and Blu

(continued from page 4)

A seasoned band with seven
albums, countless singles, and
rave concert, club, and college
dates behind them, it is to
NRBQ’s credit that their No. 1
priority has always been the
sheer artistry and genuine fun
inherent in the music itself. As a
result, NRBQ’s music
transcends styles, categories,
and periods, proving that good
music is truly timeless.

NRBQ is not only fun to listen
to, they’re also a lot of fun to
watch: NRBQ shuns gimmicks,
staging, or artificial effects in
its incredible live perfor-
mances, as in its studio work,
relying only upon the fun, vitali-
ty, and creativity of the group

itself. Always unpredictable in

content but never in quality, no
two NRBQ shows are ever the
same. NRBQ’s_ honest, no-
nonsense approach to the music
business as a business also
comes through loud and clear in
their musical statements, par-
ticularly refreshing at a time
when musical creativity and
complexity are often sacrificed
to the ever-escalating demands
of mass appeal.

Want good music? NRBQ is
your band.

The preceding was a press
release from NRBQ’s Rounder
Records, and while often this
hype should be dismissed as
hype, in this case almost any
superlative would be _ inade-
quate to describe NRBQ.

I’ve been fortunate enough to
catch the band twice, both
times in Charlottesville. They
have played there several times
at the Mineshaft and were also
featured as the opening for the
Atlanta Rhythm Section (1 hope
it’s no slight to ARS fans that I

Jack Emmer’s Early
Years In Football

NOTE: This is the second in a
series of articles by Sports Editor

Ralph Frasca.

In this week’s look at the
athletic careers of our il-
lustrious denizens of the
Physical Education depart-
ment, I spoke with Jack Em-
mer, who was drafted by the
New York Jets and later played
minor league football before

embarking on a_ coaching
career.
Emmer graduated from

Rutgers University in 1967. He
starred in football and lacrosse.
The professional scouting

* : oe

  

i Fi

system at that time consisted ot
scouting combines, in which in-
dependent scouts evaluated a
player’s talent, -and_ then
reported their findings to any
team who subscribed to the ser-
vice. Scouting combines,
although relatively inexpensive
to the respective teams, were
less personalized than in the
past, prompting one scout to
sigh, ‘‘Combines take all the fun
out of scouting. They eliminate
all personal contact with the
players.”’

Emmer was_ scrutinized
under this system, and thus had
little knowledge of which teams
were interested in him. ‘I
thought I would be drafted by
Dallas, to tell you the truth,”’
said Emmer. ‘‘They were, and
still are a very thorough and
deliberate organization. They
seemed to have their eye on me,
and told me that I would be
drafted in the first six rounds.”’

As it turned out, Emmer was

 

chosen by the Jets in the 13th
round, as a wide receiver.
There were about eight
receivers in the Jets’ training
camp, and three veterans
—Don Maynard, George Sauer,
and Bake Turner — were sure
to make the team. As the Jets
had planned to carry only four
receivers, Emmer faced stiff
competition.

After’ surviving the early
cuts, Emmer’s primary com.
petition proved to be Tomm:
Burnett, a highly touted drat
choice who had been given a no-
cut contract; hence effectively
eliminating Emmer’s chances

é
to make the team.

“I don’t wish to sound bitter,
but I felt that the Jets didn’t
challenge us enough in camp. I
wasn’t given the opportunity to
prove myself in rigorous
physical competition. Also, they
did not take into consideration
the intangibles, the X-factor.”’
They were only concerned with
tangible things like statistics,
not desire, hustle, and other
qualities for which ther are no
stats,” says Emmer.

After being released by the
Jets, Emmer accepted an offer
to teach history and coach foot-
ball at a high school in Levit-
town, New York. Not wishing to
hang up his spikes, he played
for a Jets’ minor league farm
team in Waterbury, Connec-
ticut.

‘After a while, playing ball
proved very inconvenient. The
drive from Levittown to Water-
bury was 100 miles one-way,
and I just couldn’t devote that
much time.”’

  

To rectify the situation, Em-
mer latched on with a New York
Giants farm club in Mount Ver-
non, New York, much closer to
home. He played for the re-
mainder of 1967 and the 1968°
season, and was about to return
in 1969 when he received an of-
fer to coach at Cortland State
University, one of the SUNY
(State University of New York )
schools. After spending three
years at the upstate New York
university, Emmer came to
Washington and Lee in 1972,
where he became head lacrosse
coach and offensive line coach
of the football team. ‘‘I feel that
the facilities and people here at
Washington and Lee have made
this the best working situation
I’ve ever been a part of,’ Em-
mer commented.

In the fall of 1977, Jack Em-
mer was promoted to the posi-
tion of Assistant Athletic Direc-
tor.

“The University of Virginia
was courting me, and they
made a very interesting offer.
However, Bill McHenry enticed
me to stay here by offering me
the promotion.”

Emmer resigned his football
coaching post that year in order
to concentrate on the lacrosse
team.

“‘T think lacrosse can become
a very popular national sport
which eventually attains profes-
sional status, but it needs to be
developed on the high school
level.’’ Emmer_ continued,
‘There are two basic disadvan-
tages to the sport — it doesn’t
have the international appeal
of, say, soccer,and it requires a
player to pay a substantial
amount of money for equip-
ment.”

Jack Emmer, like most of the
coaches at W&L, does not
believe in granting athletic
scholarships to prospective
students who are outstanding
athletes.

“Coach Emmer believes that
when a person goes out for
lacrosse and works hard at it
because he wants to, that in-
dividual will learn responsibili-
ty,”’ said Kevin Walakovits, a
freshman lacrosse candidate.
‘‘We play top-notch scholarship
schools like U.Va. ° and
Maryland, and we’re just as
good as they are, even though
they recruit top players and
havé a much larger school
population. Coach believes that
teamwork and togetherness can
beat any scholarship school.”’

Emmer’s outstanding record
would seem to bear out that
bold statement. He has guided

 

Jack Emmer in 1966 at Rutgers University.

the Generals to the NCAA
playoffs for seven of the past
eight years, as well as ranking
in the top ten amongst Division
I schools nationally seven
times. A stickler for defense,
Emmer has produced an All-
American goalie every year
since his arrival, as well as a
horde of All-Americans at other
positions.

A highly respected coach both
locally and nationally, Emmer
reflected on his earlier years, in
which football had a higher
priority.

‘My high school didn’t have a
lacrosse team, so I was mainly
a football player. I developed a
great interest in lacrosse while
at Rutgers, but by the time I
was an upperclassman, I had
aspirations of playing profes-
sional ball. Since there is no
professional lacrosse league, it
had to be football.

“IT began thinking seriously
about playing pro football when
pro teams started to talk to me
about lucrative contracts,”
Emmer recalls.

Unlike some former athletes,
Emmer does not live in his

nostalgicly

coveting the glow of former
stardom.

“I wouldn’t like to be thought
of as Jack Emmer, the guy who
was drafted by the Jets. That
was only one part of my life.
I’ve retired from the playing ©
aspect of sports, and now I take
pride in my coaching.”” Emmer
went on to say, ‘‘There are
many ex-athletes who just can’t
accept the fact that they are no
longer the players who were
coddled and worshipped by the
public. I think fans associate
professional sports with tinsel
and glamour. They only see an
athlete as a heroic figure on a
gum card. They don’t see that
playing a professional sport is a
grueling, intense job which is
far less glamorous to the

athlete.”’
After his fling with profes-

sional football, Jack Emmer
has progressed to his current
job, which he does well. He does
not particularly care to look
back, but prefers to continually
move ahead, striving to meet
the next challenge.

Indoor

by Rick Swagler

With tonight’s meet in Lyn-
chburg, the Washington and
Lee indoor track team begins
what will be, in the words of
Sports Information Director
Ken Ries, ‘“‘short, intense, an
important”’ season. Coached by
Norris Aldridge and Frank
Miriello, the team will compete
in only four meets this season,
including the ODAC champion-
ship.

Traditionally, indoor track
has been looked upon as merely
preparation for the more exten-
sive outdoor track season this
spring. However, freshman
Lars Keeley holds some very
nontraditional views about in-
door track. Keeley favors in-
door track over both cross coun-
try and outdoor track because
“more strategy is involved.”
He also remarked that there
was a “‘closeness’’ between the
indoor track teammates, which
he didn’t feel existed in cross-

Track Commences Short Season

country.

After cross-country, Keeley
optioned to run — sometimes as
much as fifteen miles per day.
It is this additional training that
Keeley will be counting on when
he runs the half-mile and two
mile races this season.

Vic Jaramillo, a senior ex-
change student from Peru par-
ticipating in his first year of
competitive track, is ‘‘very op-
timistic’’ about the season.
Jaramillo also cites
togetherness as an integral part
of the team’s quest for victory
in the ODAC championship.
Jaranillo has set some very
demanding goals for himself
which reach beyond college. His
ambition is to run for Peru in
the Olympic Games. “In my
country,’’ Jaramillo noted, ‘“‘it
is not very difficult to par-
ticipate in the Olympics.
Because we have so few
talented athletes, the govern-

ment cannot afford to be very

selective about its represen-
tative.”’ :

Indoor track is not solely
composed of runuing events. As
Charlie Alcorn pointed out, shot
put competition is also an event.

. Alcorn, a freshman from Vic-

toria, Texas, placed second in
state shot put competition in his
high school division. When ask-
ed about the reputation of in-
door track as being merely a
‘“‘warmup”’ he commented most
of the meets will be very com-
petitive but that ‘“We may be in
over our heads at the VMI
Relays.’”’ He remarked that
everything is being geared
towards the ODAC champion-
ship.

Alcorn commented that field
coach Miriello was “‘form con-

scious,’ an aspect Alcorn stated
was his weakest. As for the rest
of the team, Alcorn said
freshman Pete Whitehead looks
“pretty good’’ and junior John

McKee, in his first year, should
become proficient after his
form is refined. Alcorn is hav-
ing trouble adjusting to the
longer, plastic shot used in in-
door competition, and this is
causing him to make form
errors.

Keeley, Jaramillo and Alcorn
were highly critical of the W&L
facilities. Charlie Alcorn ques-
tioned the reasoning behind not
installing facilities such as
those found at VMI when
Warner Center was built. In
reply to this dissatisfaction,
Aldridge replied that he ‘‘didn’t
want to get into that.’’ He went
on to say that W&L is fortunate
to have high quality facilities
nearby. Aldridge expects the

ODAC championship to be held
at VMI next year, which should
give W&L a slight edge, he said.

Although the team is missing
R. J. Scaggs due to his committ-
ments to the basketball team,

and Billy Morris due to
pneumonia, Aldridge says that
team morale should remain
high, although Morris’ and
Scaggs’ talents will be missed.

When asked of the team’s
weaknesses, Aldridge cited the
jumping events — long jump,
high jump, pole vault, and triple
jumps — as problem areas, due
to a lack of depth. The team’s
strong points are Todd Howe
and Parker Schenecker in
hurdles, the Kadesky brothers
— Keith and Kevin — in sprints;
Russ Rector in the high jump;
and Alan Anouritage in the high
and triple jumps.

After only two and one-half
weeks of practice and problems
with the flu, the team travels to
Lynchburg tonight to begin its
season. Aldridge expects the
team to do fairly well, but
refuses to speculate on the ef-
fect of having the ODAC cham-
pionship meet and Fancy Dress
on the same weekend.

Generals Lose Invitational, Beat Hornets

by John Harrison

Inexperience, unrest
resulting from differences in
philosophy, injuries, and some
bad breaks have made it a
frustrating and disappointing
season for the W&L wrestling
team. The fact that the
Generals have posted only two
victories to date indicates a
marked decline from their suc-
cess in the past three seasons.

The Generals have won three
of the previous four ODAC
championships and were
runners-up last season, even
though they entered the event
with a lowly 3-8 record. This
season there is no conference
championship to look toward
once the regular season is over.

With five meets left and the
chance to finish the season with
a winning mark no longer possi-
ble, the Generals must look
within themselves to find the

necessary motivation to com-
plete the schedule. This is not to
suggest that coach Gary
Franke is incapable of main-
taining team spirit, for he has
certainly proven otherwise.

However, it looks like the
Generals will, from here on in,
be competing solely for pride, to
prove something to themselves.

There was some good news
for the Generals last week.
Elbert Umila, who left the team
less than three weeks ago, has
decided to return. His victory in
last Wednesday’s meet against
Lynchburg helped W&L defeat
the Hornets, 31-22. “Elbert
thought he may have acted
hastily when he quit. He decid-
ed afterwards that he still
wanted to be a part of the
team,’’ Franke explained.

The Generals were not as for-
tunate the following night, drop-
ping a 32-24 decision to the
University of Richmond. Team
captain Dave Stoeffel (167) and
freshman Tim Valliere (158)
posted wins in both the Lyn-
chburg and Richmond meets.

Saturday’s W&L Invitational
was dominated by the North
Carolina entries. Paced by Jay
Garish (150) and J.T. Hearst
(167), the Catawba Indians suc-
cessfully defended their title.

‘Sale Items Include:

They rolled up 571% points to
edge Elon, which finished with
54\%. Pfeiffer was third with 49,
and Davidson placed fourth
with 47 as the schools from the
Tarheel State swept the top four
spots. Elon’s Jay Lineberry, the
126-pound champion, was voted
the Invitational’s outstanding
wrestler.

Rounding out the scoring
were Hampden-Sydney and
Lynchburg, both of whom tied
for fifth place with 45 points.
W&L tallied 37, and Longwood,
which suited up only five
wrestlers, scored 11.

Tim Valliere was W&L’s lone
representative in the finals. His
attempt to come from behind

against Lynchburg’s Steve
Massengill fell agonizingly
short, 5-4.

W&L emerged with only one
injury, but it proved to be a
crucial blow to the Generals.
Senior Jim Forte, who wrestles
in the 190-pound weight class,
bruised some ribs in his match
and is lost for the season. Coach
Franke plans to move Dave
Stoeffel into Forte’s class. This
will create a vacancy at 167.

Kroll Quits, Replacement Sought

by Phil Murray

Chuck Kroll has resigned as
baseball coach at Washington
and Lee and will leave his post
before the season starts.

‘I’m grateful to have had the
opportunity to coach here, and
I've learned a lot,” said Kroll
earlier this week.

of 1978 as an assistant football
coach and was named head
baseball coach in December,
1978. He will assume his new

Generals Get Bounced By

by Dale Park

Just as things appeared to be
going right for the Washington
& Lee varsity basketball team,
the situation took two turns for
the worse last night in the
Generals’ 80-70 loss to Eastern
Mennonite COllege at Warner
Center.

One bad turn was the loss
itself, only W&L’s second loss at
home all season, but their se-
cond straight loss to an ODAC
rival. The Generals watched
their ODAC record slip to 4-3.

The other bad news was the
shoulder injury to playmaker
George Spears, the team’s

the night.

“Why we played that way I
don’t know,” said head coach
Verne Canfield. ‘This five-day
layoff was supposed to rest our
team, but I guess it didn’t.”

Mennonite raced to a 34-26

On January 22, the
Washington & Lee varsity
basketball team dropped a
disappointing 87-79 decision to
Lynchburg College at Lyn-
chburg.

The loss lowered the
Generals’ ODAC record to 4-2
and brought their overall mark
to 12-4.

Against Lynchburg, W&L’s
previously red-hot shooting
cooled to a frigid 40 percent
from the field. All five General
starters managed double figure
scoring performances, yet only
two shot 50 percent or better as
W&L watched a 38-36 halftime
lead slip away.

“Obviously, it is going to be a
rough game when you miss
layups and dunks,” continued
Canfield. ‘‘We just played dumb
basketball — we lacked leader-
ship but we've got to keep work-
ing.”

Senior co-captain Carby Hoy
led his team with 15 points and
grabbed seven rebounds.
Classmate Rob Smitherman, at
center, followed closely with 13
points and seven rebounds,
while forwards Brian Hanson
and Clark New chipped in 12
and 11 points, respectively.

The Generals’ next game will
be Sat., Jan.31, when W&L hosts
Maryville College. Gametime is
8 p.m. at Warner Center.

 

Mennonite, 80-70

Senior co-captain Carby Hoy
hit 8 of 16 shots to lead the team
with 19 points. Brian Hanson
scored 16 points on 8-for-15

shooting, and grabbed 15 re-
bounds.

The three remaining starters,
junior guard George Spears,
junior forward Clark New and
senior center Rob Smitherman,
shot a combined 13 for 40 on the
night. Spears finished with 15
points, while New and Smither-
man contributed 12 and 10
points respectively.

Smitherman, like Hanson,
iad a big night on the boards,
dulling down 15 rebounds.

Swimmers Beat Sheperd, Even Record

The Washington and Lee
swim team moved a step closer
to its dream of a winning record
when it defeated Shepherd Col-
lege 57-48 this past Saturday,
Jan. 24, in W&L’s Cy Twombly
Pool. The Generals, who im-
proved their record to 3-3, will
strive to push above the .500
mark this Saturday, Jan. 31
when they travel to face
William & Mary.

‘“‘We said before the season
that we’d like to get the winning
record. At this point, with five
dual meets left, it looks like
we'll be one win over .500 or one
win under, and we’re not think-

As CIA Is Weakened,

by Jack Sharman
The Central Intelligence Agency was one of the
primary victims of the post-Watergate fallout (or
foolishness). If one ponders at length and with
energy, one can indeed remember the CIA. Sure,
sure, the guys in the coats. Intelligence,

kaboodle. Due to the revelation of its excesses of
the past, some of which did not, the ef-
ficaciousness of the Agency ‘vas reduced to the
point at which the only piece of information it
could retrieve from Moscow or Peking or Havana
was the price for digital stimulation administered
by streetwalkers in those metropolises.

Stansfield Turner, the present Director, has
demonstrated approximately the same com-
petence as that of the President under whom he
has served. Yet, quake not. President Reagan’s
designate for Director, William Casey, will do
much to raise the status of the organization and
once again instill motivation in its members.
Casey served in the OSS during World War II, and
he is a capable administrator, evidenced by the
fact of his successful management of President
Reagan’s campaign. One does not envision Casey
dismissing veteran agency administrators out of
hand, as Turner did, simply because Idaho’s

anti-perspirant and thereby evinces no concern
that the KGB might be doing something besides
holding church bazaars.

There is no question that we are behind the
Soviets in the area of intelligence gathering, a
position endangered by negligible public,
legislative, and executive support, by vitriolic or
irresponsible attacks by the press and various her-
bal individuals such as Phillip Agee, and by a
number of laws that allow almost anyone, should
he be sufficiently diligent, to find out what is going
on in the CIA. Two new bills are being considered
by Congress which, if passed, may rectify the
situation somewhat.

The first would simply exempt the CIA from the
strictures of the Freedom of Information Act. The
Act does, of course, have some notable qualities,
but not when it is applied to the CIA. The Agency is
not the junior league: it must function in extensive
if perhaps not complete secrecy, or it will not func-
tion at all. Making accessible to the public most
anything written down on paper within the CIA is
‘not a drive for above-board governance of the
Agency, it is an exercise in foolishness.

The second bill would make it a criminal offense
for any CIA employee, past or present, to make
public the names of CIA officials. Such a law
would do much to nullify the noxious activities of
individuals such as Agee to whom, one might
argue, could be applied the term ‘“‘traitor”’ in both
its moral and legal senses. Although the penalty
need not be as severe as that for treason — albeit
the case could be made that the transgressions the
bill defines are treasonable — the penalty should
be stiff enough to effectively inhibit the violator
from having a chance to commit the same act
again within the generation.

With these two bills, and a renewed, favorable
interest in the CIA on the parts of the public and
the President, we may yet be able to gather in-
telligence other than the votes of a Muscovite
bordello.

when reselling them, thus pric-
ing them at 50 percent of
original retail value. When the
Washington and Lee Bookstore
receives them, it in turn marks
them up another 25 percent. The
student thus pays 75 percent of
the total original retail value
when buying a used book.

But could independent selling
— the sale of books among
students themselves — serve as
a viable alternative ? Both
seller and buyer might stand to
profit in this situation, since the
seller could sell his books at a
price greater than that which he
would receive from the used
textbook company buy at the
same time less that that which
the student would have to pay at
the bookstore. It is practiced
among some students, but the
buying back of books by the
bookstore at the end of each
year tends to siphon off poten-
tial dealers in the direct-sell

market.
No viable solution to textbook
prices seems imminent;

students simply have to absorb
increased prices and increased
prices along with increased tui-
tion as a function of general in-
flation in the economy.

Year in and year out one of the dullest and least
noticeable events of the Washington and Lee campus
is the process on White Book changes. Sure, with Fan-
cy Dress around the corner and the Spring semester
not too far behind, it is hard to get excited over what
appear to be obscure semantic changes in a book that
most of us read only once, if ever at all. Yet now,
more than ever, these changes could be critical to the
honor system — possibly determining whether the
system retains the strength to remain intact or if it
will be forced into a change. Honor Systems around
the country have crumbled or wilted in recent years,
and while some still exist on paper they are virtually’
ineffective.

The Honor System at Washington and Lee is still
strong and remains one of the outstanding aspects of
this university. But nationally students are taking
honor cases to the courts and winning judgements
which either grant the defendent a new trial or place
him back into the school. If the Executive Committee
can find a way or ways to improve the system, we
urge it to do so. We know the EC has the university’s
best interests at heart, yet we urge that the White
Book changes be more extensive and handled dif-
ferently than proposed Monday night. Two ideas
which spring to mind are utilization of faculty
members in addition to the administration and input
from law students who have been involved in counsel-
ing students accused of violations. The faculty, legal
representatives from the law school and the Ex-
ecutive Committee all become familiar with the
system and White Book; it only seems natural that
the changes should include full participation by those:
who get involved.

Graduate Rebuts Johnson’s Comments

Dear Editor:

I have just read Ed Johnson’s
evaluation of W&L. I found
most of his remarks offensive at
best, and those regarding
research opportunities at the
university fallacious as well. I
was a Robert E. Lee Research
Scholar, albeit under. the
auspices of the Chemistry
Department, and found the ex-
perience educational and the
faculty both cooperative and en-
thusiastic. I do not imagine the
faculty in the Physics Depart-
mentwould go out of its way to
close the frontiers of research
to someone as talented as Mr.
Johnson. Even his talents must
have limits, however, as the

ability to transfer to a more ac-
ceptable campus seems to be
beyond his realm of ac-
complishment.

Then there is that lather of
lust that Mr. Johnson claims to
work himself into by the end of
the week. Strange, in my years
at W&L, the fact that women
were for weekends only was
never pointed out to me.
Thanks, Mr. Johnson, I'll
remember that!

I must however agree with
our proud scholar that the
Naval Academy would have
been a better choice for his
education. What, with all those
midshipwomen around for
close-order drills, he would

have never been lonely during
the week. As for his desire to
pursue his training in physics,
Annapolis would have been
perfect. The last physicist from
the Naval Academy that pops
into my mind is...let me
see...Jimmy Carter! The Navy
has its good points, however.
Mr. Johnson would have gotten
some drills in good taste along
with maneuvers in tact. He
could use them both.

So, congratulations on your
scholarship, Mr. Johnson, and
God save the Queen.

Sincerely,
William R. Schooley ’78
Birmingham, Ala.

‘Renounce The Deal’

Dear Editor:

I am writing this letter for the
purposes of supporting the
views expressed in the Wall
Street Journal of January 21,
1981 and to inform others of
these views. The editorial was
titled “‘Renounce the Deal’’ and
its first sentence was: “The
agreement the United States
made with Iran for return of the
hostages has the same moral
standing as an agreement made
with a kidnapper, that is to say
none at all.’’ The editorial goes
on: ‘“‘This was not an agree-
ment, it was extortion. And it is
important for the world to know
that extortionists are not entitl-
ed to the same legal and moral
consideration as governments
operating in accordance with
international law.”

I strongly agree with these
views. I feel that the new ad-
ministration of the United
States is under no obligation
whatsoever to submit to the
terms of an agreement
negotiated with the Iranian bar-
barians. Indeed, the Iranian’s
treatment of the former
hostages graphically illustrates
their savagery. The 52
Americans suffered extremely
poor diets (often including wor-
my powdered milk), long
periods of solitary confinement,
beatings, fake executions,
games of Russian roulette and
being told of a parent’s death.
In this last instance, the
Iranians offered to free this
hostage in exchange for secret

information. To honor an agree-

ment in light of this and other
information is unthinkable and
sets an extremely dangerous
precedent. President Reagan

should not hesitate to renege on —

any part of the agreement made
with these brutal criminals. The
Wall Street Journal article ends
with this sentence: ‘‘We should
not hesitate to make it clear
that an agreement negotiated
under such conditions is wor-
thless and equally clear that
anyone who attempts the same
thing in the future will not be
treated so gently.”

I would also like to state my
belief that Jimmy Carter has
been given far too much credit
for the release of the hostages
(if indeed the word credit can

be ‘used under these cir- |

APRIL ‘81

NICAT

   

Prepare For:

cumstances). It was clearly the
Iranians’ perception of Presi-
dent Reagan as a strong and ef-
fective world leader that played
an extremely large role in the
release. Of course, former
Carter officials are partially
right when they attribute the
release to the economic sanc-
tions against Iran and the need
for U.S. arms in their war, but

this was still very gentle treat-
ment, as the Wall Street Journal
article indicates. The timing of
the release undoubtedly _in-
dicates the Iranians’ perception
of President Reagan as a man
of action and an aggressive
leader, and President Reagan
should be given a great deal

more credit

‘Killer Game’ Organizer Feels Distressed

Dear Editor:

I find it distressing that the
editorial staff has such a dearth
of material to choose from as to
resort to picking on the Killer
game. In a week which was
highlighted by two of the most
important events in recent
years, you chose to malign an
entertaining game which has
been enjoyed by literally
thousands of students all over
the country.

You suggest that I didn’t give

~ the Honor System the respect it

deserves. If you had bothered to
ask anyone on the Executive
Committee, you would have
discovered that I called Bob
Willis on my own initiative
before the E.C.’s last meeting.
We discussed the poster issue at
length. I explained that the
Honor System was included on’
the posters only to stress to par-
ticipants the importance of be-
ing honest between one another.
Bob clearly understood my in-
tentions and promised to fur-
ther these at the upcoming E.C.
meeting. I also told him that
you were considering having an
article written about the killer
game in last week’s paper
(which you did not do). I had
hoped that my intentions would
have been included in this arti-
cle.

So you ask for respect? I feel
as if I did my share. Now let’s
talk about you. Not only did you
do your best to destroy this
game in its most important
week of promotion, but you used
the Phi Delta Theta house as a
convenient tool to further
deceive the student body by
allowing that horrendous car-

     

toon to be published. You knew
damn well that the killer game
was.a private enterprise and
had nothing to do with the Phi
Delt house at all. To suggest
that the Phi Delts are shady and
dishonorable is inexcusable.
Not only is such ‘treatment
highly unprofessional, but I

 

would venture to say that it is
dishonorable on your part. An
apology to the Phi Delt house is
in order. I ask you then, is that
the kind of respect to which you
were referring? .

I am sorry that you are either
too busy or too above the game
to participate next week. For

Drennen

I attended the Jan. 19 EC meeting, at which time
Bob Willis referred to Mr. Drennen and the Killer
Game. In its discussion, however, the EC referred to
the game as “‘the Phi Delt Game.” Unfortunately, I
received the wrong impression as to who was organiz-
ing the game. I therefore apologize to the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity for any embarrassment caused to it.
Our editorial opinion concerning the Killer Game re-

mains unchanged.

Bill Whalen

those of us who will be playing, |
it will definitely be a nice break |
from the monotonous pleasan-|
tries which sometimes fill our |
hours here at W&L. |
I thank you for the chance to |
explain myself. |
Sincerely, |

Richard Drennen |

Phi Delt
Offended

Dear Editor:

As a member of Phi Delta
Theta Fraternity, I must take
offense at your misrepresenta-
tion of the ‘‘Killer’’ game adver-
tized about campus. The game
was not, as reported by Bill
Whalen, “‘organized by the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity for the
purpose of raising money.’’ The
game was organized by in-
dividuals, albeit Phi Delts, for
their own gain. Todd Smith’s
drawing, likewise, portrays a
gang of Phi Delts in the process
of subverting Robert E. Lee and
his Honor Code. While Smith’s
sketch is no doubt clever, it is
wholly inaccurate and irrespon-
sible to depict an entire
Organization in such a
derogatory light.

I resent being slighted for an
activity with which I have no
connection. I feel certain the
respective fraternities to which
the editors belong would not
care to be held responsible for
the reputation of the 1980-1
Ring-tum Phi.

Kappa Sigma Denied Special Use Permit

(continued from page 1)

James E. Gianinny of 523 S.
Main St. presented a petition
signed by 29 neighbors opposing
the Kappa Sigma move. Gianin-
ny said six families near the
house have children and that
this group felt the fraternity
would adversely affect the
neighborhood due to loud noise
and parking problems.

Myers responded by saying
that two points should be con-
sidered by the neighbors: 1) the
new fraternity members have
“decisively different attitudes”’
from students who occupied the
house in the late 1960s and 2) the
new house would be strictly
supervised.

The most vocal opposition to ,

the move came from those
neighbors who remember what

the area was like in the 1960s.

A. A. Adams III of 6 Edmond-
son Ave. recalled footballs
thrown through his windows,
beer cans tossed on his porch,
stereos playing full blast and
furniture and beer’ kegs
decorating the front yard of the
house. “I feel like the same
thing will happen again,” he
said.

Virginia Moran of 511 S. Main

 

Popeye — _

(continued from page 4)
un roller skates, ladders, eic. She manages to pull
it off rather well, and one of her songs, in which
she justifies her imminent marriage to Bluto, is
the best musical sequence the film offers.

Other highlights: Paul L. Smith as a panting,
bear-like Bluto, Ray Walston, who acts beautifully
without appearing to act as Popeye’s pap (he may
be forgiven for his token song), and an extraor-
dinarilly expressive child actor who plays the in-
fant Swee’pea. The part of Wimpy, played by Paul
Dooley, deserves better.

The photography is straight, nothing flashy, but
very bright and colorful and enhances some of the
bizarre costumes nicely. The blues, reds and
yellows are like brilliant reproductions of the old
comic books and animated cartoons. But it’s all
very relaxing and during the slow parts actually
sleep conducive depending upon one’s physical

of the unrealistic atmosphere the story affords.
There was an awful movie a year or so ago with
Kirk Douglas called The Villain (now seen
sporadically on HBO) which attempted to act out
what appeared to be scenes from old Roadrunner
cartoons, with Douglas as a human coyote.
Popeye is more successful because it takes
familiar cartoon situations that are physically im-
possible and makes them funnier than the
original. An example is one of the best scenes,
where Popeye punches out a no-good, swiftly
knocking his head back and forth like a punching
bag.

A little tighter editing may have made
Popeye better. Although it takes a while to get
there, the ending is well-executed. I was frankly
surprised that the whole thing was as good as it
was and am pleased to read in Variety that it is
beginning to earn back a portion of its $20-million

St. complained of past noise and
parking and violations ‘“‘when
they had a house mother”’ and

said that calling the police was ~

a. waste of time. “I’ve lived
there from 1960 to 1970 with the
fraternity and from 1970 to 1980
without it, and I prefer to live
without it,”’ she said.

Claude B. Colonna of 606 S.
Main St. said that the Planning
Commission had denied a 1972
request by an antique dealer to
move into the same address. He
said a new fraternity would
lower property value in the
neighborhood and urged the
commission to consider the
facts and to be “consistent in
every phase.”

Scattered support for the
special use permit came from
alumni and a few others who do
not live near the proposed loca-
tion. W. Gordon Saunders of 104
‘Colston St. said that the 16-
room, six bathroom dwelling is
ideally situated for a fraternity
house. Saunders did not give his

address until pressed by
Planning Commission Chair-
man Harry L. Ravenhorst.

When discussion was com-
pleted, City Manager John V.
Doane said that the overwhelm-
ing opposition to the permit
came from those directly af-
fected by it and moved that the
application be denied. The mo-
tion was passed unanimously
and was met with applause.

New House Corp. now has the
option to submit an application
for the special use permit to
Lexington City Council, where
approval seems unlikely.

“*T thought the handling of the
situation by the planning com-
mission was fair,” said Scott
Dacus, Kappa Sigma president,
earlier this week. ‘‘It seemed
concrete against us at the hear-
ing. I felt ‘that the decision
reflected the display of opposi-
tion that afternoon.”

‘‘We’re considering options,’
said Dacus. ‘‘We’re just going
to have to start over.”’

Interview:

Final Details Set For
Weekend-Long Superdance

by Steven Perry
As Superdance ’81 ap-
proaches, the long hours of
planning and preparation are
starting to pay off with over one
thousand registration packets
in distribution, and both J.
Hemby and Tripp Brower ex-
pect an increase in participa-

tion over previous years.
During the dance-a-thon, four
grand prizes will be awarded.
These special prizes fall into

two categories. The dancer with
the most money pledged
receives a trip for two to Key
West Florida. The runner-up
will be awarded a trip for two to
Greenbriar Resort. The re-
maining prizes will be awarded
for the two largest cash dona-
tions received during Super-
dance ’81. Brower stated that in
addition to the four grand
prizes, the dancers will be eligi-

Houses Question
Noise Ordinance

by John Ran Smith

You’re at a Wednesday night
party at one of the fraternity
houses. It is late, well after mid-
night. There are a few people
still sucking down brews and
some good tunes are playing,
seemingly not too loud. Sudden-
ly an officer of the Lexington
Police Department pops into
the room and cites the president
or social chairman with a viola-
tion of the Lexington Noise Or-
dinance and also for failing to
obtain a ‘‘noise permit.”’

End of party.

This has been the scene in
many of W&L’s fraternities
over the last three years.

Finally, some of the fraternity

leaders have been so frustrated
by the ambiguity of the or-
dinance that they have begun to
take action.

Three houses charged last fall
with violations of the ordinance
challenged the charges in court
in December and were found
not guilty of violating the noise
ordinance. The houses were
found guilty of failing to obtain
a permit, however, which a
fraternity is unable to get for a
Wednesday night.

Phi Delta Theta, Kappa
Alpha and Sigma Chi were all
represented by local attorney
Eric Sisler in the case, and each
decided to appeal their convic-

Willis And The Honor System

 

EC President Bob Willis has long been a spokesman for the honor
system at Washington and Lee. In an interview with Ring-tum Phi News
Editor Bill Whalen, Willis explains some of his views on the honor
system and assesses the future role the EC must play in guaranteeing
that the honor system remains a credible doctrine.

Phi: First, Bob, give us your view of the honor system, not the
White Book’s.

Willis: The honor system at Washington and Lee, in my opinion,
is a system that students have established to govern themselves
and to ensure that a spirit of trust is the rule of life here at Washing-
ton and Lee. It pervades all aspects of life. The emphasis is on
students, and the definition of honor, in my opinion, has to come
from students and has to be defined by students of each student
generation. It is asystem by which students themselves govern and
set rules for themselves and interpret those rules as they perceive
trustworthy and honorable conduct.

Phi: In your own opinion, do you think W&L’s honor system
works?

Willis: Yes, I do. | think each year there are more and more
pressures from the outside world to circumvent the system, but I
think the system continues to work at Washington and Lee because
of the students’ complete control of the system. It works because
the administration remains out of it and the students put faith in it

and are more inclined to turn someone in to enforce it, to abide by
the decisions of the (Executive) Committee.

Phi: You mentioned some ‘‘outside pressures,’’ could you
elaborate on those?

Willis: There’s always the pressure, first of all, that as W&L
becomes more cosmopolitan, as we attract more people from a
wider ranger of socio-economic backgrounds, as we look toward a
greater diversity of students, then the EC and the student body
have a greater challenge of indoctrinating and orienting, if that’s a
better word, incoming students to the honor system because
“‘honorable”’ and ‘‘gentlemanly conduct”’ are terms that are more
foreign to some of the students coming in. What might be accep-
table in the Bronx may not be acceptable in Tracey City, Ten-
nessee. In that sense, there has to be a greater effort by the com-
mittee to field the different currents that are coming in to the stu-
dent body and to respond to those. Also, there is a general tendency
in society today, in my opinion, to do whatever you can so long as
you don’t get caught. I think more and more people have that im-
pression. For the honor system to work, it’s imperative that the Ex-
ecutive Committee orient people and tell them that we are not go-
ing to tolerate that at Washington and Lee — that honest is an
honest intention. That is, to perceive the facts as they are and not as

given away every hour.

Interspersed with the twenty-
eight hours of dancing are
several pie throws. Dean Mur-
phy, who was last year’s most
popular target, remains the
favorite to raise the most
money this year. However,
students will also have the op-
portunity to peg Dr. Worth,
Dean Atwood, Mr. Leach and
Prof. Smith. When asked why
he would submit to having a pie
tossed in his face, Dean Murphy
stated that “It’s an excellent
way for the students to get in-
volved in the community.” He
went on to say that he hopes the
fraternities on campus will be
willing to pay a lot of money to
nail him.

Although the first registration
deadline for the Dance-a-thon
was yesterday, it is not too late
to sign up. The final deadline for
registration is 7 p.m. Friday.
When asked whether the $50
minimum for dancers would
decrease participation, Hemby
explained that the pledges could
be obtained over the phone, so
the contestants should have lit-
tle trouble finding sponsors.

In a related marathon, Chris
Daniels ran 48.1 miles — from
Hollins College to Zollman’s
Pavilion — to benefit Muscular
Dystrophy. By covering this
distance in seven hours and 55
minutes, Daniels netted over
$1,550 for the M.D. cause.
Daniels, running at an average
of 10 miles per hour was pleased
with his performance. This sen-
timent was later echoed by
Vince Coviello, who trailed
Daniels by car throughout the
marathon. Coviello stated that
Daniels was in good spirits
throughout the race despite two
muscle pulls.

The F.D. Bid

My finger trembled as I inserted it in the telephone dial. Did I dial

the right number? What will I say? Will she remember me? Sweat
trickled off the cold, hard receiver. Then...the rings, the rings, six
long, tortuous rings. Then...

“Hello, hello...”’

I was stunned. Speechless. Gaping.

“Er, ah, yes, this is, ah, Patrick Elior McAlister, III. Is, ah,
Elizabeth Christian Morgan at home?”

“Wait a minute; I'll get her for you...Lizzy, Lizzy.” Giggles. Gig-
gles. Giggles. All I could hear were giggles.

“Hello. This is Elizabeth Christian Morgan.”’

“Oh, ah, hi Lizzy; I mean Elizabeth; ah, do you remember me? I
mean, ah, this is Patrick Elior McAllister, III, and ah, I met you
last week at the mixer at the fraternity house, and you knew my
sister from high school in Fort Worth, and we talked about Dallas
and I was wondering if you like pizza, no I mean, I was wondering if
you wanted to go to Fancy Dress weekend with me up here at
Washington and Lee III, I mean at W&L.

“Ah, Patrick, ah, well, I don’t know, Patrick, when is it?

“The last weekend in February.’’

“Oh, Pat, I’m so sorry; I can’t make it. My grandmother died.”’
Click. That was freshman year.

My finger trembled as I inserted it in the telephone dial, I was so
drunk I could hardly see and I pretty well knew I wasn’t dialing the
right number. Cool confidence oozed through the receiver. I just
hope she can’t smell the liquor on my breath, I thought to myself.

‘Hello, this is Pat III. Is Tricia St. Clair around?”’
Ah, no you have the wrong number.”
~ “Oh, really who’s this?”
‘*(Sexily ) Sassy Crabtree.”

“Oh, really, great, great. Say what are you doing the last
weekend in February? Do you want to come up for a big party anda
wild time? If it gets boring, we can always go up to the Parkway
and drink some wine.”

“Sounds great, but where will I stay?” Click. That was
sophomore year.

My finger trembled as I inserted it in the telephone dial. I
wondered how a nice boy like me (Patrick Eliot McAlister, III)
could get into a situation like this.

““Hello...mom, mom...ah, could I speak to dad?”’

“‘What’s up, Pat III? Do you need some more money?”’

‘Well, ah no, dad, well, you see, you know, well, I’m down here at
the Second Precinct in Roanoke, and ah, well...me and the guys kin-
da got set up with these whores, nor really whores, more like
hookers, and ah, we got busted.”’

“That’s ok, Pat III. I remember how things were when I was at
Washington and Lee. You were probably just trying to get a Fancy
Dress date.”’

Click. That was junior year.

My hand trembled as I picked up the receiver. Two o’clock in the
morning and the phone wouldn’t stop ringing. Dumb broads won’t
let a stoned man sleep.

‘Hello...Pat III, here.”

“Hi, Patrick?” This is Mary-June Sterling. You remember me,
don’t you? We met last week at the Hollins mixer and you were
talking about some great party called Fancy Dress, or something
like that, and you told me ( sexily) that I had the most beautiful eyes
and an arousing southern accent, and then...

“Oh, Patrick, you told me you loved me and we...’’
Click. That was senior year.

Students Stay Away From EC Gripe Session

by Cope Moyers

If mere numbers are any in-
dication of how students view
life at Washington and Lee
University, then Tuesday
night’s special Executive Com-
mittee meeting proved that
almost everybody is content.

Despite a two-week advertis-
ing campaign which featured
numerous notices posted
_ around campus and in the Phi
reminding students and faculty
of the special meeting, not one
person came before the com-
mittee to ‘‘gripe.”’

‘Maybe we could stir-up
some interest if we lined the EC
up on the colonnade,” said
Senior Representative Marshall
Clark, who originally suggested
that the committee hold a
special session so people could
voice their complaints directly
to the EC.

Clark said that he was
bothered by the lack of student
interest but added that he hopes
the special meetings will con-
tinue.

“Eventually, maybe in a year
or two, people will once again
become interested in_ this
university,’’ Clark said. ‘‘I still
think it’s necessay to have them
(the meetings) in the future.”

Committee member Mike
Nogay did tell the committee of
a complaint brought to his at-
tention earlier in the week by a
law student. Nogay said the stu-
dent asked him if it would be
possible to post the hours
Warner Center would be
available for intramural
basketball games since the law
school has an extensive in-
tramural program involving 12
teams.

Sophomore member Pete
Baumgaertner reported that a
student had complained to him
about the price the Student Ac-
tivities Board charged for
tickets to Winter Weekend. Ac-
cording to Baumgaertner, the
student had asked him why the
student tax money acquired
from each student in September
is not applied to SAB activities
such as Winter Weekend.

President Bob Willis told
Baumgaertner the committee
will examine this complaint fur-
ther when the SAB makes its
monthly report next week.

Baumgaertner also proposed
that an Executive Committee
suggestion box be placed in the
Supply Store/Co-op so students
can make complaints or sugges-
tions without having to appear
directly before the committee.
His proposal was approved and
the box should be available for
students in the coming weeks.

Shortly before the meeting
adjourned, freshman represen-
tative Ben Hale suggested the
EC make a strong effort to re-
mind students that all Monday
night meetings are open for
students to appear before the
committee. Hale suggested that
the time and place of all com-

_ mittee. .meetings. be posted

along with the minutes.
Secretary Bud White said he
would see that all the pertinent
information was included each
week.

On Monday night, the Ex-
ecutive Committee held its
regularly scheduled meeting
and agreed to select students
and administrators next week
that might serve on the White
Book Revisions Committee.

Two administrators and three
students will be selected by the
full committee to help revise
the White Book. Three

members of the Executive
Committee, Eric Myers, Ben
Hale and Jim Vines, will also
serve on the subcommittee.
Vines replaces Bob Willis, who
said that time constraints make
it impossible for him to remain
of the subcommittee.

In other business, Willis
reported that a subcommittee
investigation into the possible
use of VDT equipment in Reid
Hall by the Phi is continuing but
that a recent discussion with
journalism professor Hampden
H. Smith III had revealed that it

would be impractical for the
newspaper to use the equip-
ment.

Willis said Smith had told him 1

that because the VDT equip- -
ment was ‘‘unreliable’’ and ex-
tensive time would be required
to operate the machines, it
would not be possible for the Phi
to use the equipment.

Bud White read a letter to the
committee from Dean Watt
regarding the EC’s earlier sug-
gestion that the university add
course titles to student report

For all you do,

is coming through.

ty

cards. According to White, Watt
approved of the idea only if
there is enough space on the
present cards for the additional
information.

Unless room can be found
nothing can be done until the
present supply of cards js &*
hausted. White said the univer-
sity still has about 10,000 of the
old cards.

The EC will meet again at
6:30 p.m. on Monday, in the EC
room of the student center.

Review

_ Ariel Warfare

by M. Shaw Pyle

The last Ariel — the one that
raised eyebrows (and gorges)
on the Executive Committee
—is hard to deal with. One gets
the impression that the editors
and staff would have liked it
that way; which worries me.

The plupart of pieces are,
well, pointedly pointless; they
are terribly fashionable, for-
mulaic exercises in — who
knows what? Look, the type of
piece we’re talking about is all
too common: a narrative, often
in stream-of-consciousness
form, detailing an experience
almost on the fringe of reality in
its severance from life as most
of us live it. However mundane
this incident, the author
abstracts it as far as possible
from the context which could
alone give it sense, imbues it
with mystic overtones, inflates
it to mythic proportions, and re-
counts it as if it were a new
canonical Gospel. There is a dif-
ference between vignettes, like
Palmore Clarke’s award win-
ner, “Pavement,” and Steve
McCabe’s equally honored
“The Angelus,’’ and mere ex-
amples of deliberate obfusca-
tion: N. J. Brady’s “A Lost Part
of Their Journey,” the painfully
mannered attempts at mental
gymnastics of John Dyer Fort
(“While Society Sleeps’’), and
AOAOA’s untitled letter beginn-

ing ‘Dear Citizens of the Peo-

_ple’s Republic of the United

States...’’:: (the word
“sophomoric”’ is the kindest cut
I can deal that waste of paper
and ink).
Perhaps it is my Southern
heritage peeking out, but the
Jack Sharman ‘‘Alabama
Glands and Strawberries”
seems to me to deserve not only
the ’80 Mahan Poetry Award it
garnered, but careful attention
by everyone who can read. If
this doesn’t convince you, dear
reader, of the rot at the core of
our society — a rot compounded
of uxury, luxury, and a lack of
any philosophic values at all, at
all — why then, you are just too
far gone yourself: tunes like
‘the falcon sure as hell don’t
listen to the falconer in this
county...”” and ‘‘...days of our
strange, prophetless youth’”’
ought to be carved in stone
—and may yet, on the grave
marker of our generation. (Of
course, suicides aren’t
supposed to get Christian
burial...).
“The Heartland,” a poem by

J. Jacob Jones, also evokes a
real feel for a_ certain
philosophical paradigm I love:
it is sometime called ‘“‘the
American character.” Jones’
piece smells of the high plains,
and the foothills of the Rockies;
of wheat and turf and honest

 

toil.

As for the rest of the issue,
well, it’s unkind to speak too
harshly of the dead. The rot we
just discussed is deep — in fact,
it’s getting deeper. (Time for
those hip-waders, reader). Par-
ticularly reprehensible ex-
amples of the prevailing fad in
circumlocution are Jas. K.
Leva’s new ‘‘Izaak’’ and most
of the ((for want of a better,
printable word) ‘‘poems’’:
works like ‘‘Puddle Grave’ and
“On Wanting a Cookie...’’ If this
sort of verbal exhibitionism is
how English majors get their
cookies, it’s time for the legions
of literate lectors to panic.
These labored attempts to be
“cerebral” and ‘‘arty’’ — some
of which, God help us, won
Mahan awards — smell of New
Jersey and small Midwestern
literary socieities; of provincial
college in the ’20s and the
Chablis and Brie snoblets of the
world.

It is time for the chaps at
Ariel — and in the English
Department — to start thinking
for themselves. Failing that,
they can at least have the
courtesy to ape C. S. Lewis, J.
R. R. Tolkien, H. L. Mencken,
and other critics of the word
they have profaned.

No wonder the picture’s fuz-
zy: the Ariel’s on the blink.

‘Claire’s Knee’ to be Shown

by Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society presents next Eric
Rohmer’s philosophical com-
edy Claire’s Knee (France,
1970). It will be screened on Fri-
day, February 6, and Saturday,
February 7, at 8 p.m. in
classroom ‘‘A”’ of Lewis Hall,
free of charge. In support of the
muscular dystrophy dance
marathon being held on campus
this weekend, the Film Society
will make a donation amounting
to half the money collected at
the showings ofClaire’s Knee.

Claire’s Knee is one of
Rohmer’s last “moral tales,’’ a
series of six movies which ex-
plore modern ideas about
morality and sexual freedom,
and their relation to fantasy.
Other well known movies in the
series include My Night at
Maud’s(1969) and Chloe in the
Afternoon (1972). In explana-
tion of his genre, Rohmer has

said that ‘‘What I call a conte
.moral is not a tale with a moral,
but a story which deals less with
what people do than with what
is going on in their minds while
they are doing it.’’ Rohmer is a
former critic for Cahiers du
Cinema, the French film journal
associated with the rise of the
New Wave.

The moral tale in Claire’s
Knee grows out of a witty con-
ceit. Jerome, an engaged man
on summer vacation in the lake
country, becomes obsessed with
the knee of a young fellow
guest, Claire. His only desire is
to touch her knee without her
realizing that he has spent
weeks planning this, for him,
momentous event. Jerome
finally returns to his fiancee
with his reputation ostensibly
unsullied; Aurora, a woman
novelist friend, watches from
the sidelines, drawing material
for her stalled plot.

This conflation of comedy of
manners and rationalizing
philosophy produces a movie
that, to use a term from music,
is a fascinating, whimsical
caprice. In supremely civilized
dialogue, Jerome takes flight
from freedom and passion into
the clarity and security of self-
justifying intellectuality. On the
most disturbing level, his
intellectual obsession with
touching Claire’s knee is
perhaps even more ethically
provocative than outright
seduction because it lacks both
emotional involvement on his
part and consent on hers.

The Film Society has chosen
the following films for presenta-
tion this winter and spring:
Werner Herzog’s Aguirre, the
Wrath of God (Germany, 1973),
Luis Bunnuel’s That Obscure
Object of Desire (Spain, 1972,)
and Georgi Shengelaya’s
Pirosmani (Russia, 1971).

A Look Ahead

by M. Shaw Pyle

We woke up one morning and
nothing was were we'd left it.
Guest director Richard
Mogavero was gone — for per-
sonal reasons. The major pro-
duction for the winter term was
no longer Hot L Baltimore, but
Look Homeward Angel. And a
minister’s wife who just hap-
pened to move to Buena Vista
also just happened to be a
creditable MFA from the great

.| midwest, and is now teaching

W&L’s acting and directing
courses. (We see the Hand of
God in this one, folks.) Welcome
to W&L, Mrs. Langdon.

But despite the musical
chairs motif, our beloved
troubadors just keep troubbing

ODAC Basketball
Tourney Is Just
Around The Bend

by Ralph Frasca

As such phenomena have a
tendency to do, the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference Basket-
ball Championship Tournament
is only three weeks away.
Slated for February 26-28, the
event sports a few new wrinkles
this year.

Two more rivals from the
ODAC have been added to the
fray, namely Maryville and
nemesis Roanoke, which boosts
the number of competing teams
to eight. When the ODAC held
the first tourney, way back in
February of 1977, only four
schools vied for the crown, as
was the case with the 1978 tour-
nament. The 1979 and 1980
championships were expanded
to include all six ODAC teams.

In addition to the expanded
field, this year’s event is the
first in which a neutral site will
be employed. The Salem/
Roanoke Valley Civic Center in
Salem, Va. is neutral enough, I
suppose, although it is in much
closer proximity to Roanoke
than any other school, ensuring
the presence of vast amounts of
Maroons’ fans.

The 1977 championship took
place at W&L; 1978 at Lynch-
burg; in 1979 the site was
Bridgewater; and last year’s
host was Hampden-Sydney.

The first-round action will
take place on Thursday,
February 26. The semi-finals

are on tap the following day,
and the title game commences
on Saturday. With the addition
of the awesome Roanoke club,
16-1 at this writing, W&L is
predicted to relinquish the tour-
nament crown they won last
year. However, the Generals
overcame staggering odds to
thrash Roanoke on January 20,
and one wonders if Verne Can-
field can prime his players for
another spoiler role. The
Generals also capped the 1977
and 1978 ODAC tournaments,
while the Lynchburg Hornets
took the 1979 crown.

The ODAC pairings are deter-
mined by the customary
“outside-in” method. The team
which finishes first at the con-
clusion of the regular season
plays the cellar-dweller, the
second-place team squares off
against the seventh-place team,
three against six, and four ver-
sus five. Roanoke will probably
face Emory & Henry, but the
other pairings are anybody’s
guess. Just a hunch, but I’ll bet
the Generals meet Bridgewater
in first-round competition.

The ODAC champion ad-
vances to the four-team NCAA
Division III South Atlantic
Regional Tournament, which is
the first leg of the journey
towards winning the National
Division III title.

I’ll return with the promised
Boyd Williams interview next
week,

Basketball Alumni
Play Saturday

18 former Washington and
Lee University basketball
players will visit their alma
mater on Saturday, February 7
to compete in the first annual
W&L Alumni Basketball Game.
The event will begin at 7:00
p.m. in W&L’s Warner Center
and serve as a lead-in to the
Washington and Lee vs. Lynch-
burg College game, set for an
8:30 p.m. tip-off.

“These alumni have done a
super job in organizing this af-
fair,”’ reports W&L head coach
Verne Canfield, who has coach-
ed all the participating alumni
during his 17 seasons with the
University. ‘‘Their efforts show
the committment they have to
the basketball program and to
the University. I look forward to

a fun evening with them.”’

Included among the alumni,
who will divide into two teams
and play a regulation game,
are: Tommy Cox (class of
1967); Norwood Morrison and
Stuart Fauber (’70); John
Glace (’72); Doug Clelan (’73);
Randy Raylor and Greg
Croghan (’75); John Podgajny
and Paul Maloney (’76); Kim
Sims, Bob Flint, and Don Berin
(77); Mike Wenke and Dave
Leunig (’79). Canfield’s first
season at W&L was 1964-65.

Preceeding the Alumni game
will be a W&L junior varsity
contest with Fork Union
Military Academy, set to begin
at 5:15. The W&L-Lynchburg
varsity contest is the Generals’
next-to-last home game of the
1980-81 season.

Generals Bounce Maryville
As Graves Becomes Starter

by Dale Park

‘My philosophy and pro-
cedure,”’ explained Washington
and Lee head basketball coach
Verne Canfield, ‘‘is that
whenever there is a problem,
we as a team stop and discuss
it. Good communication is im-
portant in dealing with pro-
blems.”’

After back-to-back losses to
ODAC rivals Lynchburg and
Eastern Mennonite, Canfield
and his team sat down last week
and, in a series of private con-
ferences, discussed the slump
the Generals had fallen into.

At least initially this “‘clean-
ing of the air,” as Canfield
referred to it, has paid off.

Last Saturday the Generals
took a step toward getting back
on a winning track as they roll-
ed past ODAC rival Maryville
College, 77-64, at the Warner
Center.

Late Score:

E&H 70
WA&L 60

Against Maryville the
Generals started a five-man
line-up which included, for the
first time this season, freshman
forward John Graves.

Senior co-captain Carby Hoy,
was moved to point guard to
replace the injured George
Spears. Junior Clark New join-
ed Hoy in the back court at the
other guard position.

in the game, forcing several

turnovers. But W&L began to
break the press soon
thereafter; taking control of the
game as the first half progress-
ed.

Commented Canfield: ‘We
put some people in some
strange positions and they
responded well for us. Clark

(New) and Carby (Hoy),
although they had a few more
turnovers than I would have lik-
ed, played well, considering the
situation.”

After holding a 34-29 halftime
edge, the Scots threatened
momentarily in the second half.
The Generals regained their
composure, however, and cruis-
ed to the 13-point victory.

W&L’s starting five scored all
but two of the team’s total
points.

New led the way with a game-
high 21 points, followed closely
by Smitherman, who con-
tributed 20 points and blocked
four shots. Hanson chipped in 14
points and grabbed seven re-
bounds, while Hoy and Graves
netted ten points apiece. In ad-
dition, Graves pulled in eight
rebounds.

“Graves did a good job star-
ting and will continue to play
that way for us,’ noted Can-
field. Yet Canfield added that
the Maryville game was impor-
tant because the defense had
again begun to respond.

Said the coach: ‘‘A basketball
season runs a long time and
people had begun to forget their
roles. Everyone was trying to
be a scorer. Against Maryville,
we denied them the easy
baskets inside.”’

Rich Suttle, Maryville’s
senior forward and leading
scorer, was held to just ten
points, making only four
baskets from the floor in 12 at-
tempts.

On Saturday, the Generals
will get a chance to avenge their
earlier loss to Lynchburg as
W&L hosts the Hornets at
Warner Center. Game time is 8
p.m.

Rugby Club Looks To Improve Program

by David Dehay

In its January 19 meeting, the
Executive Committee approved
an $850 grant to the W&L Rugby
Club. Despite the fact that the
club’s request for $1200 was
denied, sponsor Lawrence
Babits and club president Alex
Richards are quite happy with
the grant.

“T’m grateful for any kind of
support,” said Babits, who
teaches in the Anthropology
department. ‘“‘I think if the EC
gives us any money at all we’re
doing okay.”

“T think the EC has always
been real nice to us about fun-
ding,” added Richards, a
senior. “We keep real good
financial records, so they know
exactly where the money is go-
ing. Therefore, when we ask for
money, the EC really knows we
need it.”’

“We could have used more
money,’’ Richards concluded,
‘‘but I was very appreciative of
what we got.’’

Babits explained that a key
part of the budget was destined
for the construction of a scrim-
maging machine. ‘‘The football

ee
(el

ic

equivalent would be a blocking
sled, but the spacing between
the pads is different,’’ Babits
said. ‘‘They usually run around
$1200 to $1400, but we can buy
the lumber and build one
ourselves for $300 to $400. I’ve
built one before, and I figure we
can do it over the Washington
Holiday.”

Both Babits and Richards are
very optimistic about the
Rugby Club’s upcoming spring
season, beginning March 7 with
a home game against the
University of Richmond.

“I think we’re going to do real
well this spring,’ said Babits.
“We're going to have some
rugby players who didn’t par-
ticipate this fall.

‘“‘We’ve got a lot of players,
including many new people,”’
said Richards. ‘‘We had about
50 people at our last practice,
and I expect more to show up in
the future.”

Babits feels the team has im-
proved since the beginning of
the season last fall. ‘‘We played
six games and lost them all,” he

said. “We started with three
players who had played rugby
before and lost our first game,
42-0. In our last game we played
an even better team, shut them
out in the second half, and
would have beaten them if we
had had 10 more minutes. We
just made a lot of beginners’
mistakes at first.”’

Babits and Richards stressed
that anyone is welcome to join
the club, and everybody will
have an opportunity to play.

“We'll have numerous oppor-
tunities for players because we
have such a large schedule,,’
Richards said. The team has
about 18 games scheduled, in-
cluding a tour of North
Carolina. ‘“We’ve scheduled a

lot of double weekends on our
home games so that everybody
will get to play,’’ he added.

‘‘We’ll have a chance to play
some top-flight teams, and I
think we’ll not only be more
competitive, but win more
games than we lose,’’ Babits
Stated. ‘‘It looks a lot better now
than it did two games into the
season last fall.”’

Jones Named Baseball Coach

by Phil Murray

Craig Jones, a 1980 graduate
of Virginia Military Institute,
was named head baseball coach
Thursday night, filling the post
left open by last week’s resigna-
tion of Chuck Kroll.

Jones will function as interim
coach for the remainder of the
season.

Athletic Director Bill
McHenry termed the Norfolk,
Va., native ‘‘the most qualified
person for the job.”’ Jones’ im-
mediate availability also con-
tributed to his selection.

At VMI, Jones was a four-

year letterman in both football .
fw) wi

Aluin-Bennis

Since 1963

and baseball. On the diamond,
he played shortstop and pitched
in the starting rotation.

However, Jones is best known
for his achievements as the
VMI place-kicker. He was All-
Southern Conference in 1977,
78, and 79.

Jones was drafted by the New
York Giants, but sat out for the
entire football season with a
muscle pull in his leg. The
Giants, however, thought
enough of Jones to keep him on
the injured reserve list. He will
rejoin the team in July for
another try at professional foot-

 

ball.
Jones excelled off the playing

field as well. He graduated
with a B.A. in English and
received Academic All-
American honors three times.
He also distinguished himself
with two U.S. Army Superior
Cadet awards in 1977 and 1978.

Chuck Kroll resigned as head
coach last week to take a full-
time position at the Colorado
School of Mines, where he will
be an assistant lacrosse and
football coach.

Kroll had coached the team

for two years.

Indoor Track Season Begins,

W&L Places Third

by Rick Swagler

The W&L indoor track team
held its first meet last Thursday
night in Lynchburg. W&L plac-
ed third in a field of six, com-
posed of Lynchburg College,
Bridgewater College, High
Point College, Roanoke College,
and Radford College.

Individually for W&L, Russ
Rector placed fourth in the high
jump and fifth in the long jump.
John McKee placed fourth in
the shot put, while Alan Ar-
mitage took third place in the
60-yard high hurdles. The team
of Jenevein, Brod, and the
Kadesky twins collected the se-
cond place award in the 440-
yard relay.

Coach Norris Aldridge was
“pretty happy about the results
for this early in the season,”’ but

added that ‘‘we need a lot more
work.’’ Looking ahead,

Aldridge noted that “by the
ODAC championship (Feb-
ruary 28), we'll be in good
shape.”

Like most coaches, Aldridge
is using indoor track as practice
for the spring track season.
However, team member Jon
Kelefant believes that ‘“‘we
should just blow off indoor track
and save the money.”’ He refer-
red to the indoor season as a

series of ‘‘expensive time
trials.” He called Lynchburg *‘a
terrible place to run’’ because
of the shortness of the track (12
laps to the mile), and the fact
that it is unbanked, but remark-
ed that everyone else — except
Lynchburg — ran under the
same disadvantage.

Howard Herndon, primarily a
one and two-mile runner, looked
at the indoor season as “‘a train-
ing stage which should not be
considered as separate from the
outdoor season.”’ Herndon said
that he ‘‘must work harder’’ to
compensate for a lack of
natural speed. Herndon is op-
timistic about the outdoor
season, citing ‘‘more quality
with most of our key people
returning.” He also named
freshman Paul Chapman as an
up-and-coming team member.

When asked about the track
facility available at VMI, both
Herndon and Kelafant com-
pared it to a “community’’
track, saying that ‘‘when we use
it, it’s like our own.”’ Herndon
commented that if W&L were a
Division I school, construction
of an indoor facility could be
justified to improve recruit-
ment. Both Herndon and Kela-
fant stated that track was not
their primary reason for com-

ing to W&L.

The next meet will be the VMI
Relays this Saturday. Among
the schools expected to compete
are Davidson, VPI, U.Va., Ten-
nessee, Maryland (where the
world record holder in the in-
door 60-yard high hurdles and
outdoor 120-yard high hurdles,
Renaldo Nehemiah, ran until
several weeks ago), and a host
of other schools. The meet
begins at approximately 11 a.m.
Saturday and will end about
5:30.

SKLSAKKKSANWHNKKNHH HHH HH

You can expect the unusual
with Washington and Lee track.

During a recent distance run
in preparation for the upcoming
indoor season, a group of eight
Generals came across a
sizeable brush fire in a pasture
outside of town. Good deed
doers all, they risked new shoes
and warm-up suits to battle the
blaze to the finish. When the
work was done, the group
brushed itself off and, as the
local fire department arrived at
the scene, trotted off into
anonymity. As one General put
it, ‘‘we just collected ourselves
and headed into the sunset, just
like the Lone Ranger after a
day’s work.”’

Wrestlers Start Comeback,
Capture Two Matches —

by John Harrison
The performance of the W&L
wrestling team in its last two
meets was not surprising or
even unexpected, given the
strength of the opponents.
Nonetheless, for a team that
has had every break go against
it, last week’s wins against
Hampden-Sydney and _ Long-
wood were a strong indication:
that the team has realized if it
preseveres through the difficult:
times, then success will be
realized.

The 27-24 victory over the
Tigers was especially pleasing
for the Generals, according to
coach Gary Franke. ‘‘They (H-
S) placed higher than us in the
W&L_ Invitational,’ said
Franke, ‘because they have
better wrestlers in certain
weight classes and _ they
benefited from that. Overall,
though, I knew we matched up
well against them. It was a
question of whether or not we
would take advantage of the
situation.”

Deserving particular notice is
captain Dave Stoeffel’s pinning
of last year’s 177-pound ODAC
champion, Howard Cobb. Scott
Mason, Greg Coy and Win
Sisson also recorded falls over
their opponents, while Tim
Valliere posted an impressive
15-8 victory.

Some of the luster of last

 

Saturday’s 35-24 contest of
Longwood was diminished
because the Lancers had no
alternates and were forced to
cede several matches. In the
matches that did take place,
Valliere, Mason, Sisson and
Stoeffel had pins and Richard
Kopelman posted a 16-13 tri-
umph.

Their latest victory raised the
Generals’ duel-meet record to
4-5.

The remaining four meets
promise to be more challeng-

ing.

Next Wednesday’s

    

meet will be at home, as Divi-
sion I James Madison provides
the opposition in Warner Center
at 7:30p.m.

Before then, the Generals
must take on a tough field in
this Saturday’s Pembroke In-
vitational. The season will then
come to an abrupt end with
back-to-back meets with David-
son and Catawba on the 13th
and 14th.

Coach Franke knows that his
team will have to be at its best if
it hopes to win any of those
meets.

Scott Mason hangs tough.

George Spears

by Ed Gonsalves
_ It all began with a burnt
jersey.

As a freshman on the 1978-79
Washington and Lee University
basketball team, George Spears
encountered some _ unsettling
troubles with his uniform.

“I was not able to wear my
jersey because my name was
burned by the press which
prints the letters,’ the per-
sonable athlete from Annan-
dale, Va. begins. ‘I regretted
not owning a team jersey. It
may sound kind of funny, but at
the time I felt apart from the
team.”

As a sophomore, however,
things began to change. First,
he acquired the long-sought and

much-coveted jersey. Then,
unexpectedly, he acquired a
starting position for the
Generals.

As a freshman, Spears had
seen action in just three of the
Generals’ 27 games, scoring 12
points and registering six
assists. As a sophomore, he was
thrust into the starting line-up
at point guard and, after an
understandable period of ad-
justment, responded with a 10.4
scoring average and a team-
high 89 assists. W&L won its
conference tournament and ap-
peared in NCAA Division III
Regionals, where George earn-
ed All-Tournament honors.

‘It took me a while to become
comfortable with the starting
position,’’ he explains. ‘“The
team had to adjust to me, just
as I had to adjust to the team.

Le
Spears Excelling
At Point Guard

 

We had to mold together.”

Before the W&L team could
mold, however, Spears had to
be sure he himself had molded
to the guard position.

‘In high school I was a
shooting guard, always moving
without the ball so I could get to
the open spot,’”’ the Flint Hill
Prep graduate comments. “But
at W&L I’ve become the guy
who brings the ball upcourt and
looks for the open man. It re-
quires a bit more organiza-
tion.”’

While Spears has learned
basketball organization, he for-
tunately has not left the
shooting skills behind.

“George handles himself well
on the court,”’ offers head coach
Verne Canfield, presently in his
17th year as W&L basketball
mentor. ‘The players have con-
fidence now that George will
perform well, and George has
not disappointed them. He’s
proving himself to be a fine
point guard.”

He is also proving himself as
a student, something for which
he credits W&L’s basketball
program.

“Playing Fasketball, or any
sport for that matter, and going
to a school which is academical-
ly oriented, is tough. But if you
become disciplined enough to
think ahead, you can win. In
fact, Coach Canfield has
statistics to show that our team
carries a higher grade point
average while in season than in
the off-season.”’

Swimmers Beaten

By William & Mary

by Phil Murray
The W&L swimming team’s
hopes for a winning record this
season were dimmed last
weekend as they lost to William
and Mary, 71-42.
Coach Page Remillard had
little to say concerning the meet
in Williamsburg, which saw his
team’s record fall to 3-4.
Co-captain Mike Bernot and
freshman Tim Rock continued
to excel, as each earned two vic-
tories. Bernot was victorious in

the 100-yard freestyle (48.6) and
the 200-yard free (1:47.8). Rock
won in the 500-yard free (4:58.0)
and 1000-yard free (10: 10.4).

Remillard seems more con-
cerned with the Davidson and
Furman meets this weekend.
‘“‘We have two difficult meets
this weekend; if we’re tough
we'll win them, if we’re not we
won’t.”’

The Generals will be looking
once again to attain their goal of
a winning record.

black tie dress is the costume of

“will be loaded with more
entertainment than ever.”
THEATRE LOBBY
Drawn to the student center
by two searchlights, this year’s
Fancy Dress goer and his date
will enter the ball through one
of the two entrances to Evans
Dining Hall, which will be
decorated to resemble a theatre
lobby. SAB members plan to

way play with a throne and
several court jesters roaming
about. The room’s main attrac-
tion, however, will be Peter
Duchin and his orchestra,
whose performance is expected
to be broadcast live on WLUR.
The SAB also plans to dispense
much of the beer from some of
the 75 kegs of Erlanger and
Milwaukee light slated for the
evening from a bar running the
width of the room.
THE WIZ
Upon leaving Camelot,many
Fancy Dress goers will venture
down the hallway above the
Cockpit along a yellow brick
road decorated to recreate a
scene from ‘the Wiz’’. The
hallway can also be identified
by the official Broadway poster
and a rainbow on the ceiling
featuring a spectrum of bright
colors.
HELLO DOLLY
Led by a green canopy rug,
Mr. F.D. and his date may elect
to enter Harmonia Gardens,
formerly the Cockpit — the area
will be transformed into the
restaurant in the Broadway hit
“Hello Dolly.” Room Full of
Blues, a New Orleans jazz band
will play a variety of Louis
Armstrong and other hits. The

way’s newest hits ‘42nd
Street.’’ The hallway’s Broad-
way motif will be further
enhanced by recreated theatre
fronts and publicity posters of
selected plays. Along the op-
posite wall, SAB organizers
plan to paint a city skyline with
a Silver sky and ‘‘thousands’’ of
tiny lights to depict stars and
lend an exciting, carnival-like
atmosphere to the scene.
SHOWBOAT

After a stroll down 42nd
Street, Mr. F.D. and his date
may elect to cross over a
wooden plank into Fairfax
Lounge and onto a recreation of
a steamboat. Riverbank foliage
and a ship’s railing will be used
to depict a Mississippi River
scene complete with signal flag,
ringbuoys, lanterns and a pad-
dlewheel. One of the Lounges
walls will be decorated to repre-
sent an entrance into the rest of
the boat.

WEST SIDE STORY

After disembarking, Fancy
Dress goers may choose to ven-
ture down the EC hallway
through an alleyway decorated
with bricks, trashcans and, a
fire escape to recreate a scene
from the Broadway smash
“Westside Story.’ Mr. F.D.

may even feel the urge to leave
his own mark on this year’s
event. SAB organizers realize
this and encourage Fancy
Dress. goers to bring magic
markers and write graffiti on
the alley’s paper walls.

OKLAHOMA

Mr. Fancy Dress and his date
may next be lured by the coun-
try and western sounds of
Riders in the Sky into the EC
room, decorated with
checkered curtains and
possibly a covered wagon to
depict a country barn. Ranger
Bob and Too Slim will supply
the room’s entertainment com-
plete with an electric campfire
and tumbleweeds.

A CHORUS LINE
When Mr. F.D. has had his fill

on Ranger Bob and Too Slim, he
may elect to escort his date
upstairs past the University
Center television rooms and
down ‘“‘A Chorus Line.’’ This
hallway will be decorated with
the play’s official publicity
poster and a silhouette of a
chorus line.

GREASE

After making a stage-left ex-
it, Mr. F.D. .and his date will
probably enter one of the two
T.V. rooms into an SAB recrea-
tion of the room will be
decorated as a parking lot com-
plete with rearview mirrors on
the walls and foam dice hanging
from the ceiling. On the
other side of a partition SAB
members plan to construct a
malt shop where Wedsel’s
Edsels is scheduled to churn out

year’s ball.

One of the two searchlights which will mark the location of this

a complete 1950’s style musical
show.
CABARET

After a couple of malts Mr.
F.D. will no doubt want to
‘‘bop”’ down to the Cabaret, that
is Room 114 redecorated as the
inside of a 1930s German burles-
que. Centerstage will feature
Bill Clary, a comedian-
magician who will dazzle au-
diences with such feats as saw-
ing third-year law _ student
Susan May in half and making
Carole Chappell disappear.

MY FAIR LADY

If you’re looking for a place to
relax, or maybe just pass out,
the SAB plans to furnish one of
the side dining halls with tables
and chairs in the design of the
grandstand from the hit “My
Fair Lady’’ complete with
flowers, a winners circle and a
gazebo — no horses.

THE KING ANDI
In the dining room across the
way the SAB plans to recreate a
Japanese tearoom decorated

with murals, buddhas and
geisha girls.
TICKET INFORMATION

Tickets for Fancy Dress ’81
are scheduled to go on sale Mon-
day, February 23 from 10 to 4
p.m. in front of Carole

Challelle’s office in the Univer-
sity Center. The price for a

Duchin To Supply Swing

by John Wells

The SAB has chosen the Peter
Duchin Orchestra to play at the
main ball in Evans Dining Hall
during the Fancy Dress hoopla
in keeping with the On Broad-
way theme, the show
represented in the ballroom will
be Camelot.

Duchin may or may not know
about the Camelot selection.
But it doesn’t matter because,
among bandleaders or anyone
else, pianist Duchin has emi-
nent Camelot qualifications.
Not only was he raised by
Democratic stalwarts like the
Averell Harrimans, but his
band played for President John
F. Kennedy at the White House
and he has been a longtime
friend of the one and only
Jackie O.

Duchin maintains an aura of
that brief period in American
politics, and he certainly looks
like a jet-setter. It is especially
fitting that he comes to W&L’s
Fancy Dress immediately
following Bob Crosby and
Lester Lanin. Crosby is
representative of the big band

The Year They Cancelled

by Chris Peacock

The history of the Fancy
Dress Ball contains some most
interesting and_ colorful
moments. A look back at Fancy
Dresses past reveals themes
which range from the European
Courts of the Gilded Age to the
antebellum South to, and get
this, Heaven itself.

Those were the days when the
Age of Swing spread the fame of
Fancy Dress to wherever

 

     

Dress histor In

era in which Duchin’s father,
the late Eddy Duchin, made it
big. Lanin has made his name
playing for the privileged at
debutante balls, bar mitzvahs,
wedding receptions and various
country club dances. Duchin
plays big band (jazz is his
favorite) and has made big
bucks on the Lester Lanin cir-
cuit.

Duchin was born in 1937. His
father had married New York
socialite Marjorie Oelrich in
1933, and Mrs. Duchin died six
days after her son’s birth. She
had been a close friend of the
first Mrs. Averell Harriman,
and Peter was raised by the
Harrimans at their Manhatten
townhouse and country estate.
(Averell, you know, was Gover-
nor of New York before he was
FDR’s Moscow envoy.) His
youth was spent among power-
ful Democrats, high society and
show business _ personalities.
His father died of leukemia in
1951.

Duchin was a music major at
Yale, and studied piano and
performed in Paris for two

Americans had radios:

side the building reach about as

returned to New York and
formed the Peter Duchin or-
chestra in 1958, and played for
two years at the famous St.
Regis Hotel. The band was a
huge success, playing for the
Kennedys, the Rockefellers and
the Duke and Duchess of Wind-
sor.

The extended St. Regis gig led
to other engagements; and
Duchin has been on_ the
debutante circuit ever since. He
has played at the White House
wedding receptions of both
Johnson girls, the 1976
Democratic National Conven-
tion, and the inaugural balls of
Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan. Duchin is booked up
now past 1987.

A primary attraction of
Duchin’s music is the variety of
it. He can move from Bach to
Gershwin to Elvis to Rolling
Stones to Donna Summer with
relative ease. Fancy Dress Ball
and the Camelot theme will pro-
vide a suitable showcase for
Duchin’s talent and versatility.

That’s because there was no
Fancy Dress Ball that year.

Imagine that. ‘‘The outstan-

in 1971.

that reference to the ball back
in the 1930s, but the phrase con-

freshmen. )

temporary, should not seem so
surprising, what with the way

Everything from parietals in
W&L dorms to coats and ties
worn to class was biting the
dust.

Other things were markedly
different then, too.

The Ring-tum Phi observed

The Planning Behind Fancy Dress

by Frank Billingsley

Begin with one Student Ac-
tivities Board, stir in a theme
that will appeal to an entire stu-
dent body, add hundreds of man
hours of hard work, sprinkle in
a mere $35,000 — and you’ve got
Washington and Lee Fancy
Dress Ball 1981.

In the past, it’s been written
up in The Washington Post and
Time magazine, coined byTown

and Country ‘‘most prestigioius
social event of the
Southern collegiate communi-
ty’’ (or so rumor has it), and not
a student recruitment tour goes
by without some reference to it.
Fancy Dress is the event that
the old alums never forget and
that the new freshmen eagerly
anticipate.

And so it is. But most of those
people who attend Fancy Dress
never see more than brightly
colored wall-paper, fancy
decorations, good entertain-
ment, and long lost friends
—and this they see with blurred
vision. All it seems to be is a
$200, four-day drunk at the end
of February. Nobody realizes it
all began way back in
September...

Twenty-eight SAB members
close their meeting to outsiders
and lower their voices. The
Fancy Dress theme is about to
be discussed and choices of
bands has to be narrowed down.
First order of business is to look
at the budget — and that
resulted in a five-dollar raise in
ticket prices this year.

Perhaps the most important
task is finding a theme for
Fancy Dress. Everyone starts
throwing ideas around A
Western theme? The Orient?
Riverboat? Roaring Twenties?
Wizard of Oz? Carribbean? For
one reason or another, nothing
is quite right. But not to fear,
there always seems to be one
theme that everybody goes for.
This year it was ‘Broadway’.

But what could be better?
There are twelve rooms to fill
and Broadway lends itself to
enough sub-themes to do it.
Well, thank God, that’s settled.

Then the entertainment. Hun-
dreds of band names are
brought before the SAB for
voting. This one if we can’t get
this one, but if we can get this
one then don’t get that one,
unless we can’t get the other
one, but see if we can. Then
calls to talent agencies to line
up street vendors, comedians,
mimes, magicians, jugglers
and anything else that sounds
interesting and entertaining.
Can we get somebody to eat live
rattlesnakes?

Then subcommittees have to
be delegated. There are sub-
committees for papercutting,
artwork, entertainment, con-
struction, publicity, and sub-
committees for subcommittees.
Security has to be lined up,
building and grounds has to be
lined up, a photographer has to
be lined up, the beer supplier
has to be lined up, and the Din-
ing Hall and Cockpit to be lined

up. Someone has_ to
handle coats, and don’t forget
the baby grand for Peter
Duchin.

Then’ the ordering.
Everything has to be ordered.
Wall paper, posters, special
decorations, special lighting,
wood nails, hammers, saws,
staples, stapleguns, paper
cutters, glue, glitter, tape,
fabric. The FD grain cups, the
FD posters, the FD tickets, the
FD coins, the FD photos, the FD
souvenirs. Ordered, re-ordered,
sent back, and re-reordered.
And still no one knows if it will
all turn out right.

As the magic date gets closer
things get more definite. Con-
tracts are sent in, signed,
returned, signed, and sent back.

 

SAB member Danny Raskin, Co-Chairmen Pryse Elam and Jamie
Small, with member Ed Kramer.
‘I'ne artwork gets the final okay

begins. Day in and day out for
months paper is cut, measured,
and fitted for size. Re-cut, re-

measured, and re-fitted for size.

Hammers start hammering,
stapleguns start stapling, and

until seven o’clock Friday night
will the final touches be put on.
It’s a process that begins
unendingly in September. It
takes six months of prepara-
tion, thousands upon thousands
of dollars, and lots of sweat and
frustration. All for a four hour
party. If Town and Country
didn’t call Fancy Dress the
most prestigious social event in
the Southern collegiate com-
munity, they should have,

Thursday Night

by Ross Newell

Get ready to kick back W&L; John Prine is scheduled to open the
74th Fancy Dress festivities with a Thursday night concert in
Warner Gymnasium.

Prine is prime. His show, planned for 8 until 10 p.m., has been
billed as ‘“‘An Evening with John Prine.” During this evening don’t
expect to get pounded by a punk or swamped by a new wave. Prine
doesn’t wear funny sun glasses, and he won’t whip it in public.

He will provide a nice change of pace from the commercially
oriented material that dominates contemporary music. Prine has
never succeeded commercially. AM radio programmers have
traditionally overlooked the unique and engaging for the overwork-
ed and superficial and, Prine’s work, much to the artist’s credit,
has been no exception. He has yet to sell out and conform to the
wishes of recording agents or album executives.

Prine was an average American. After a stint in the army, he
returned to his native Chicago and started delivering mail. In 1970
he stopped delivering mail and began writing songs. The change of
pace did Prine right.

He’s not an average American anymore. His debut album, a 13-
song collection released in 1971, established him as a leading
American songwriter. His lyrics are direct and often biting. He
does not bore listeners with tales of teenage teases or other topics
typically covered by pop songwriters.

Prine does offer listeners as complete and interesting a course in
recent social history as any university professor could. Prine is a
social commentator, a realist with the ability to see the truth and to
tell it in his songs.

For this ability, Prine has received various honors. Time
magazine cited ‘‘Bruised Orange”’ as one of the top ten albums
released in 1978. Bette Midler and Joan. Baez have recorded his
songs, and Prine has been credited with the social observation of
Woody Guthrie and the emotional purity of Hank Williams. The
quality of his lyrics have led some critics to compare him to Bob
Dylan.

Some of Prine’s lyrics sting, others amuse. The lyrics in ‘Sam
Stone’”’ sting. The song, about a morphine-addicted Vietnam
veteran, leaves the listener wondering about the glory of being a
veteran of a foreign war. Prine describes the war’s human affect,
the ultimate result being ‘‘a hole in daddy’s arm where all the
money goes.”’

However, Prine has a lighter side. Songs like ‘‘Dear Abby”
amuse. The artist does mock versions of letters written to
America’s all around problem solver, Abby. Minus his touch of in-
sight and wit, Prine’s rendition of the letters seems to come from
the Dear Abby column in your local newspaper. As American as
station wagons and cook outs in the country is the young stud who
finds himself in a compromising situation.

‘Dear Abby, Dear Abby I never thought that me and my gir-
friend would ever get caught. We were sitting in the back seat
just shooting the breeze, her hair up in curlers, her pants at her
knees. Signed, just married.”’

The medium for Prine’s message has varied over the past ten
years. Initially his albums and concerts were characterized by an
acoustic approach. In this role, as a folk singer, Prine built much of
his reputation and following Prine’s debut album had two primary
parts, his lyrics and his work on the acoustic guitar.

However, Prine began moving towards a folk-rock style. He add-
ed a band both in the studio and on the road. In 1975 the album
“Common Sense’’ featured Prine’s new musical stet direction.
‘Bruised Orange’’, 1978, and ‘‘Pink Cadillac,”’ 1979, continued the

 

 

John Prine

artist’s personal trend towards a stronger rock orientation.

Yet, even when the rock influence was at its height Prine often
took time out during concert appearances to pull up a stool and an
acoustic guitar and return to his folk music roots.

Prine will appear at W&L as the folk musician and the songwriter
and without the addition of his band. In an attempt to make the con-
cert more personal, the Student Activities Board plans to seat con-
cert goers.in the bleachers. This should make the concert more en-
joyable for both Prine and his fans.

Also scheduled for Thursday night, beginning at 10:30 is a party
at Zollman’s Pavilion which will feature the rock’n’roll band
Tracks. The band, from Richmond, has played at W&L several
times and is scheduled to paly at the Dance-A-Thon. The admission
fee will be $2. No refreshments will be served, however, students
are encouraged to bring their own beverages.

The SAB originally planned to sponsor a Pavilion party after the :
Prine concert. However, SAB advisor Mike Cappetto advised |

 

 

John Prine
against such action. According to SAB co-chairman Jamie Small,
Cappetto felt the SAB lacked the man power and the time to pull off
two major events in one night.

Small said the SAB courted other organizations to see if they
would sponsor the party. No other takers could be found. The
university administration has never been overly fond of weeknight
parties and a fear of repercussions from the hill probably made
other groups think twice about sponsoring a weeknight party,
Small said.

At this point the party will either be sponsored by the Student Bar
Association or four or five undergraduates. The party is scheduled
to last until 1:30 a.m.

The SAB is sponsoring the John Prine concert and admission is
free. Prine is popular in Virginia and usually sells out his shows in
the state. He charges $6,000 for a solo concert appearance.
However, he promises to be worth the price.

So, around 8 p.m. on Feb. 26, break out your blue jeans, your
boots and your bowl, fit yourself with an illegal smile and wander
over to Warner gym. John Prine is a talented performer and an
awesome songwriter. If you miss him, you’ll miss more than a con-

cert.

 
 

Pavillion Party

Union

by Mike Perry

After spending a night on
Broadway, Fancy Dress con-
tinues on Saturday, February 28
at Zollman’s Pavilion with a
University grain party
sponsored by the Freshman
class. A class pass is required
for admission to the party
which is scheduled to start at 1
p.m. and continue until 6 p.m.

The event will feature two
bands and a variety of mixtures
containing 45 gallons of grain
alcohol in what Freshman Class
President Peter Collins says
will be “nothing out of the or-
dinary, but definitely a kickass
party.”

In selecting the afternoon’s
entertainment, Collins said he
tried to pick bands that would
be ‘“‘suitable to all tastes at
W&L.”’ Union Pacific, a ver-
satile band from Richmond, is
scheduled to start the afternoon

Fancy Dress Extras

by Charlie Randolph

Do you remember Fancy
Dress last year? Probably not.
Even if your date didn’t get
them all, you should remember
the souvenirs and memorabilia
you bought and or tore off the
walls of the student center. This
year, numerous reminders of
Fancy Dress will be made
available.

The Student Activities Board
will have 5,000 grain cups for
sale. The cup has a collage of
theatre marquees encircling it,
and it was designed by Len
Howard and Pryse Elam.

The SAB will also be selling a
Fancy Dress poster. The poster
was professionally designed
and printed by Silver Screen
Designs of Turner Falls, Mass.
They are the same designers
who printed the concert posters
for the New Riders of the Pur-
ple Sage and Sea Level. SAB co-

T. Oast and his tapeshow,

Beginning at 4 p.m. and conti-

repertoire contains a variety of
rock hits by such artists as
Bruce Springsteen, Elvis
Costello and Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers, to name a few.

The fact that last year’s
Pavilion party was snowed out
doesn’t worry Collins who ‘“‘an-
ticipates no problems with the
weather.” Collins is, however,
concerned about the 65
freshmen who did not buy class
passes in September. Collins
urged everyone to buy a Pass
and come out to the party.

Designs wants to use this year’s
poster in their own ads because
they feel it’s the best work
they’ve ever done.”’ The posters
will cost two dollars each.

Fancy Dress commemorative
coins will also be given away at
Friday night’s ball. One side of
the coin has the face of Presi-
dent Washington and General
Lee. The other side has the
Washington and Lee general on
a rearing horse with a Broad-
way marquee in_ the
background. The coin was
designed by John Martin.

Three students will be selling
long-sleeve t-shirts. The shirt
has Fancy Dress: 1981 printed
on a front pocket, and the back
has a crowd of elegantly wasted
people on the corner of 42nd

was designed and printed by
John Martin, Jamie Small and

would be no Fancy Dress
“because of a greatly reduced
budget and past history of stu-
dent disinterest.”’

Later, another Dance Board
member said the lack of funds
had forced the board to choose
between Fancy Dress and other
social. events. ‘“‘We thought it
was the weakest link in the
chain,”’ he said.

While no one seemed to notice
the official death of the eVent
back at the first of the school
year, come the beginning of the
calendar year and folks began
to take note.

One writer lamented in the
Phi that “The end of January
won’t bring eager young ladies
from all over the country whose
hearts have been set on ‘going
to the Fancy Dress Ball’ the
whole past twelve months. All
the end of January will bring is
income tax statements.

Think that guy took the loss
pretty hard? Then consider
what an alumnus wrote in a
state-wide magazine.

“For the old grad from
General Lee’s college it is the
most shattering break with the
past since the Generals dropped
out of big time football.”

In a more understanding tone
he added, ‘‘It would be idiotic to

bably would have been Fancy
Dress, was a concert featuring
the Allman Brothers Band and
Livingston Taylor. A month
later, the Allmans recorded a
live album at none other than
Fillmore East.

Also that weekend was a
Saturday afternoon party at
Zollman’s. Some things never
change, huh?

Well, almost. Instead of
grain, the freshman class pro-
vided ‘‘a limited bourbon mix
and steups for a Bring Your
Own Liquor party.’’ Music was
by The Eye.

So there was no Fancy Dress
10 years ago. That in itself is
hard to imagine.

Now try combining that with
the plans for the next year, and
contrast it with more recent
balls.

Fancy Dress was gone. But
not, at least in name, for long.

“Can Fancy Dress Return?”’
asked a Phi headline of March
10.

The problem, said an
editorial, “is not a lack of stu-
dent interest, but a lack of
funds.”’

The ball wasn’t such a bad
idea after all, it seems.

But the Dance Board wanted
a new affair. Forget the ‘‘com-
bination of imagination, in-
nocence, and _ snobbishness,”’
which is what that alumnus had
called the Fancy Dresses of old.

None of this black tie
business, either, said the
organizers.

“The cost is the inhibitive
thing,” said their chairman. “‘I
don’t want to spend more than
$2,500 to $3,000 on the thing.”’

And, said the newly-elected
Fancy Dress president, ‘My
philosophy is to bring it back,
but perhaps on a different for-
mat. I don’t want Peter Duchin
or...Glenn Miller. They won’t
attract enough people.”

So they had a '50s revival the
next year, with tickets costing
$5 apiece to see ShaNaNa in the
revival of the ‘‘outstanding col-
legiate social event of the
south.”’

And what about this year?

The price tag is about $36,000.

The dress is black tie.

The band is Peter Duchin’s.

ANYTHING TO GET OUT
OF A TRIAL

Here’s one way to avoid being
sent to jail. Tameka Easty, 26
of Houston, was facing a judge
for forgery charges when she
started screaming that she was
about to give birth. The
coutroom proceedings were
immediately stopped and an
ambulance was called. Easty
was taken to a nearby hospital
but officials said she still has
not given birth.

FAIRYLAND

“This is Fantasyland, not
fairyland’ a security guard told
admitted male ‘gays’’ who
were ejected from Disneyland
for dancing together this past
September on Date night. The
two gays then sued Disneyland
for violating their civil rights.
They sought damages and a
court injunction to nullify
Disneyland’s regulations pro-
hibiting persons of the same sex
from dancing’ together.
Although an Orange County
California Judge upheld the
Disneyland regulation, the pair
are determined to take their
case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

CHIMP TALKS WITH A BITE

Do you remember Washoe,
the talking chimp? — she’s the
first chimpanzee to learn
human sign language. Well, it
seems a prominent California
neurosurgeon was interviewing
Washoe and he reached over to
feed the chimp from a sack that
her trainer was_ holding.
Washoe must have interpreted
the move as an attack on her
trainer — she bit the doctor’s
finger off.

The doctor was told Washoe
flashed the sorry signal while
he washed off his wound.

GATORS AND MEAT EATING
FISH

Detroit police raided a
suspected dope headquarters
recently and found two four-foot
alligators and 30 flesh-eating
piranahas. Police say the
dealers used the animals to
scare people who bought drugs
from them.

And in other animals in the
news this week we have Agatha
the pet boa constrictor. It seems
the 6-'2 foot snake disappeared
for several months, only to
show up again a few blocks
away from home. Fortunately,
the snake had not eaten any of
the local residents.

NO MORE HASSLES
FOR HASSELMAN

A federal judge in New York
has ruled that a female lobby
attendant was wrongfully
dismissed from her job for
refusing to wear a “short,
revealing and sexually pro-
vocative’’ Bicentennial
uniform. Margaret Hasselman
had been previously employed
in a Manhattan building. “But
for her womanhood,” said U.S.
District Judge Robert Ward,
“Margaret Hasselman would
not have been required to
appear on her job...in a uniform
that subjected her to sexual
charassment.”’

Whatever happened to ‘‘if you
got it, flaunt it?”’

THE ABSENT-MINDED
PROFESSOR

From Orlando, Fla., comes a
report that a box containing
nearly 5000 pages of classified
material on nuclear propulsion
was accidently thrown away by
a Navy nuclear training school.
‘So who was elected to find the
documents amid all the
garbage? The students, of
course. Shifts of 15-30 students
spent three days looking
through piles of garbage for the
material, which accounts for
over 54 textbooks.

Almost half the papers, which
had been stored loosely or with
rubber bands around them,
were recovered in the search.
The rest of the papers are pro-
bably serving as seagull nests.

THE JURY FINDS THE
JUROR GUILTY

Serving on a jury can be ex-
cruciating, but missing it may
be even worse. Consider the
case of Karen Austin, 23, of Can-
ton, Ohio. Austin was supposed
to serve on a jury hearing a
rape trial, but missed the trial
because she overslept and
showed up two hours late. For
her negligence Austin, who had
spent the previous night
celebrating her 23rd birthday,
was fined $100 for contempt of
court and ordered to spend one
night in jail.

“Being in jail isn’t my
scene,’’ claimed Austin. ‘Here
I am Miss Straight and Narrow
of 1981, and I’ve been taken to
jail in a cruiser, fingerprinted
and photographed, and now I’m
a criminal.”

DON’T MAKE

In Baltimore, a _ Federal
district judge has upheld the ex-
pulsion of a Naval Academy
senior who participated in and
filmed a sexual encounter in-
volving five midshipmen, in-
cluding a woman, in an
academic dormitory. Judge
Joseph Young agreed with the
Navy’s decision to expell mid-
shipman Jamie Love for having
sexual intercourse with a
female classmate. Love said he
was disappointed with the deci-
sion, saying that he had been
only five months away from
graduating but now would have
to serve three years as an
enlisted man.

Apartheid at UVa.

The University of Virginia
should not manipulate its en-
dowment fund investments to
influence the issue of apartheid
in South Africa, the school’s
board of visitors decided this
week.

The statement came after
criticism from students who
urged the university to
withdraw its $23-million  in-
vested in firms with South
African operations. The board
passed a resolution which says,
“the university should not take
a position with respect to issues
of a political character.”

However, the resolution did
note that “assurance of a cor-
poration’s committment to
equal opportunity is a pre-
requisite to investment in the
firm.”

Only one member of the
board voted against the
measure.

YOU CAN HAVE YOUR
CAKE AND EAT IT TOO?
It sounded like a good idea
amid all the hoopla surrounding

President Reagan’s inaugura-
tion, but it proved to be a little
hard to swallow. Some zealous
bakers decided to create a
seven-foot, 3000 pound cake for
the inauguration, actually
made it, but then discovered
that the cake was too large to fit
through the doors of the
Kennedy Center and was too
soft to be reassembled.

So what do you do with a cake
of that size? Ship it to the first
person who wants it, of course,
which turned out to be the
Army-Navy Country Club.

ALL FOR A DATE

From Fayetteville, Ark.,
comes the news that a Universi-
ty of Arkansas freshman was
shot and killed by police after
apparently trying to get a date
at a local sorority. James
Taylor, 19, of North Little Rock,
was shot by police after ter-
rorizing a Delta Delta Delta in-
itiation dinner at gunpoint. One
sorority member said _ that
Taylor was apparently upset
with a woman who had refused
to date him.

Some of the women attending

‘ the dinner giggled until they

realized that Taylor was serious
about using his weapon. Police
say they opened fire on Taylor
after he aimed his shotgun at
one of the sorority members in
the dining room.

Weeknight
Party
Discussed

By SAB

by John Ran Smith

Several items were discussed
at Sunday night’s Student Ac-
tivities Board meeting, in-
cluding what co-chairman
Pryse Elam termed ‘‘a way
around” the administration’s
ruling that the SAB’s Thursday
night party during Fancy Dress
Weekend end by 10:30 p.m.

“The administration has said
that there will be no pavilion
party from 10:30 on,” Elam
said. Elam went on to mention
the ways in which the SAB could
hold the party, including the
facetious idea of having the
Executive Committee order the
SAB to sponsor the party.

A more practical idea Elam
mentioned, would be the plan to
have the party sponsored by
Bob Willis (EC President),
Willie Mackie (EC Vice-
President) and Elam. “That
way,” Elam continued, “‘if they
(the adminisration) come to us,
we can go to the EC.”’ The band
scheduled to play at the party if

TTES;
This weekend’s movie was

also announced by Elam.
‘Paint Your Wagon,”’ starring
Clint Eastwood and Lee
Marvin, is slated to be shown on
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
at8p.m. and7 p.m. Sunday.

Elam also announced that all
proceeds from the movie will go
to the Muscular Dystrophy
Danceathon.

In other discussion, last
weekend’s Winter Week-end
was termed a ‘‘big success’’ by
Elam. At Sunday’s meeting, no
count of the profits were made.

The progress of the work on
Fancy Dress was also dis-
cussed. 6,500 grain cups have
already been received and
posters are scheduled to arrive
on Feb. 25, according to Elam.
The price for the cups will be
three for $1 and posters will go
for $2 apiece.

The beer at this year’s ball,
according to Small, will be
supplied by the Joseph Schlitz
Company. Small said the SAB
uses a rotation method to
choose which brand of beer will
be served and this year was
Schlitz’s turn. Erlanger and Old
Milwaukee Light will be served
in the ballroom while dark and
light Lowenbrau will be served
in the Cockpit.

we wish them to be. And finally, of course, the third and, luckily,
the most insignificant at this time is the force of the courts. It is not
insignificant in the sense that it could radically change our entire
system like it could at UVa. or VMI. I think it’s radically different
because we've had very little interaction, comparatively, with the
courts. And I think the reason that’s the case is because students
control so much of the honor system.

Phi: You seem to be saying that much of the honor system’s
future lies with the EC’s ability to handle crises. What can the EC
realistically do?

Willis: It (the EC) can run a better orientation program. It could
run, maybe, a continuing type of education. It can strive to create a
better relationship with the law school. That was another outside
tension I failed to mention. Law students are coming from a
greater diversity of undergraduate schools in which they didn’t
have honor systems — that lying, cheating and stealing were handl-
ed by deans. We have to do a better job of getting those people into
our honor system and making them feel a part of it because they
are judged by a majority of undergraduate students. Many law
students call us ‘‘weanies.”’ We get no respect over there and part
of that is our failure not to go over there and help them have faith in
us. And, also, we have to be aware that in the handling of our cases,
that we remain loyal to the procedures that we outlined in the White
Book. From the White Book and the procedure therein, that’s
where we gain some type of ground legally — that’s where our
strength comes from.

Phi: Recently, a letter in the Phi criticized the role the EC plays
in honor hearings. What was your reaction to that letter?

Willis: The letter by Neil Sheehan? It’s a traditional argument
that’s brought up regularly and I hope that the committee on revis-
ing the White Book looks into it. There’s one thing, though, that I
would like to emphasize and that’s the word hearing — and I’m glad

you used that instead of the word trial which was in this letter. As a
matter of fact, I made the motion last year in the White Book
changes that the word trial be deleted in the few places it was in the
White Book. The purpose of an honor hearing is to see the facts of
the case and not to prosecute anyone. Indeed, there is no prosecu-
tion there. There’s no one that sets up a series of questions in an at-
tempt to trap the accused. As a matter of fact, when the witness
comes in, I read the statement that’s in there, and then I say, ‘“‘By
the way this is the way we usually run things, we’d like you to go in
a narrative fashion, telling us what you know about the possible
honor violation. Just tell your story and we’ll interject asking ques-
tions about specific, particular points.’”” And so what happens is
there’s no prosecution, it’s kind of an answer and facts session. As
far as being the prosecution, judge and jury, the prosecution, I
think, falls out. The judge as far as interpreting the facts or how the
procedure is run, the chairman has to rule on the admissibility,
the procedure and how things go, but is open to the advocates’ sug-
gestions. There’s no defense attorney, there are advocates — peo-
ple who give advice — and they didn’t even use to have that. I think
that’s an effort to shOw that although we don’t want to make it a
sort of adversary-type system, the need for objective advice is
there for the accused. It’s not an adversary-type system because
they don’t have anybody to attack. There’s only the committee and

the accused in there. If the EC ever turned to a system like, I

believe, at VMI where attorneys come from in town, the focus of the

committee would immediately deviate from the  truth-
ascertainment of the facts to who could present the best legal
arguments. There would be a twisting and turning of everything,
trying on one hand to convict the person. While on the other hand
getting him off. And we don’t want that. That ties into an argument
as to graduated penalties. One of the major arguments I have is
that when the EC finally deliberates, it doesn’t have to consider the
penalty, it can only consider the facts of the case and say to itself,
‘is this or is this not an honor violation?” They don’t have to con-:
sider which is more dishonorable, the theft of a five-dollar bill or '

cheating on a five percent question on a test.

Phi: You mentioned possible White Book changes. Being that
time of the year, what do you think ought to be done with the White

Book?

Executive Committee President ROB WILLIS
Willis: I hope that the White Book committee will first of all
revise many of the disjointed sentences and poor grammar. This
thing has been pieced together over the last five or ten years. There
used to be a President’s Handbook that had some of the procedures
and many of those have been incorporated into here. What I hope
the committee does would be to have a more explicit statement on
the explanation on page two. Finally, I would say that besides the
editing and deleting of repetition, I personally don’t think that
many of the things need to be in here as far as exactly what needs to
be said when a witness walks in. I hope that for statements like
polygraphs, psychological tests which allegedly determine the
truth or falsity of a witness’s statement, each EC will decide that.
Different cases and the validity of polygraph tests might change
over the years. I think the accused should be able to present any
evidence of any relevance at all as long as it has the slightest validi-
ty on his behalf. Finally, an overall look at the way the White Book
runs and the honor system — whether or not we’ve gone too far in
codifying honor in our procedures, whether or not we need to codify
more to protect ourselves from legal suits, and also whether or not
the hearing is set up in the best possible way. I wrote up a memo
that I plan to give to the committee which asks them to look into the
possibility of expanding the EC by two persons. That would provide
two people who would rotate on the committee as investigators,
they would investigate along with a third person from the school of
the accused. They would become witnesses in a hearing — more
adverse witnesses who would drop off the judging panel. The addi-
tion might come as a treasurer to the EC and another law student.

Phi: Two spring terms ago, we had a public honor trial. Two fall
terms ago, we had the Peter Engel trial. Last spring term we had
another public trial. Do you think there is a trend of people going
public with their cases and do you think the system is being abus-
ed?

Willis: No, although there is definitely a trend for people to go
public and I think part of that is because my freshman year, they
dropped the rule which said an appeal to a public hearing would go
on your university transcript. Assuming that all your best friends
know of the hearing or it’s a big thing, you really have no reason not
go to public. To me the main deterrent for going public has been
eliminated, and I think that’s fine because the EC is certainly
capable of making errors in judgment.

Phi: In a small community like W&L’s, do you think a student
can get a fair public trial?

Humanities Group Awards W&L Matching Grant

The National Endowment for
the Humanities has awarded
Washington and Lee University
a $200,000 challenge grant
which will be used to help
create a permanent endowment
for W&L’s innovative program
in applied ethics.

Under the NEH challenge
grant program, W&L is re-
quired to raise $3 in private fun-
ding for every $1 received in
federal monies.

That means W&L must
receive $600,000 in new or in-

Public Tria

creased private gifts by June,
1983, to qualify for the full
$200,000 grant.

The resulting $800,000 endow-
ment, which would also be part
of W&L’s $62-million develop-
ment program which is now in
its second and final phase will
provide permanent funding for
the program known as ‘‘Society
and the Professions: Studies in
Applied Ethics.”’

Begun in 1972 as an ex-
perimental project and later
developed under a three-year

grant from the Lilly Endow-
ment, the ethics program is
designed for undergraduates in
journalism, law, and medicine.
The program, directed by Dr.
Louis W. Hodges, includes year-
long seminars in ethics for the
undergraduates. As an integral
part of the overall program,
W&L sponsors annual three-day
symposiums during which prac-
ticing doctors, journalists, and
lawyers come to the campus to
join the undergraduates in an
analysis of the ethical dimen-

sions of their respective prufes-
sions.

A steering committee has
been established to spearhead
the fund-raising campaign over
the next three years. Included
on that steering committee are
Roger Mudd, Washington cor-
respondent for NBC-TV; Dr.
James H. Sammons of Chicago,
chief executive officer of the
American Medical Association;
A. Linwood Holton Jr. of
Washington, former Governor
of Virginia and vice-president

STEERER!

and general counsel of the
American Council on Life In-
surance; Matthew W. Paxton of
Lexington, president and editor
of the Lexington News-Gazette;
and Dr. A. McGehee Harvey of
Baltimore, professor of
medicine emeritus at Johns
Hopkins Medical School.

Washington and Lee was one
of 122 cultural and educational
institutions across the country
receiving NEH challenge
grants for 1981.

Washington and Lee was one
of 64 colleges and universities
across the country receiving
NEH challenge grants for 1981.

Phi: We ran an article last week about an honor trial at UVa., one

Willis: Yes. The efforts of confidentiality do not always work with
the EC but they work fairly well. We had prospective jurors in the
last public trial who thought they knew the facts of the case and
didn’t know anything about it at all. We were able to find students
who didn’t even know the accused or anything about the case.
Because most honor violations are on the undergraduate campus
and since the most impartial: people come from the law campus
because they know the least about it, the student has an advantage.

Phi: In the Engel case, the defendant went to a federal court and
had his trial reinstated. Do you think this set a precedent at
W&L, and is it a good or bad precedent, if it is indeed one?

Willis: Most of the handling of the thing was done by (Steve)
Abraham, Bo (Dudley), our counsel, the school’s counsel and the
President and the Dean. It is my understanding that there was a

reopening of the case on the position that it was to prevent in-_

justices. The case was reheard in its entirety. —

Phi: In this case, Engel said his Constitutional rights had been
violated. Does that, in effect, mean that any student found guilty of
an honor violation can go to a court and argue this?

Willis: Engel had a rehearing because the EC, for some reason,
voted to reopen the case. I don’t think there was any weakening,
legally, by the Engel decision because you can read back to Steve
Abraham’s letter to the Phi, which said that the decision to reopen
was not a Constitutional issue but to prevent an injustice.

Phi: Where, then, do you place the honor system and honor code?
Is it a law, a sub-law or what, exactly? _

Willis: That’s why I’m very hesitant to place it into a legal con-
text. I don’t know if we’re above or beyond the law, or anything like
that. I think we have to be aware of what’s going on in the real
world, but by the same token, I think we have to judge honor and
our procedures the best way we can. We must follow what we’ve
told people. We’ve been told by our counselor that the courts
change their opinions so much that we’re going to continue doing
what we do and let the court continue to do what they do until there
is such a clash that it becomes an issue. Even Engel, who ended up
suing the school, later came back and felt satisfied with the system.
He probably did not perceive that justice was done, but at least he
had faith in the system.

I think a lot of student governments:

are bogus - a lot of their activities

are meaningless. We hear the same

thing about our student government

at W&L.’

Phi: You read articles from papers that honor systems and stu-
dent governments are being voted down at large schools. Why do
you think this is occurring?

Willis: I think a lot of student governments are bogus — a lot of
their activities are meaningless. We hear the same thing about our
student government at W&L. And yet, I think we have three areas
which legitimatize our presence here. It gives student support.
First, there.are the committee appointments. Second, the alloca-
tion of money. Finally, the honor system. Because of that, I think
students realize consciously, if not unconsciously, that without the
Executive Committee, without the honor system being run by
students, that someone would have to enforce conduct here. The
logical choice would be administrators. It would make for a pretty
nasty place to live in.

which lasted three years. Do you think that this could occur at
W&L?

Willis: I don’t think so. I think the difference was a question as to
graduated penalties at UVa. I remember reading an article where
students were voting as to whether they wanted a single sanction
and Josh (Henson) was kind of bringing all this up so that if he was
found guilty, he could raise the question. The vote was part of the
deal, there was a bit of controversy around it. Here at W&L, I sense
a pretty definite committment to the sanction. There is also a belief
that if we follow the White Book, we can standy by our decision.
We’re pretty firm in our belief that we have a system which works
and our decisions are final. And we’re not going to belabor the
point. That might have been UVa.’s mistake. The whole size issue
of UVa. is another factor. They have such a diversity and their
graduate schools are so diverse.

‘We’re pretty firm in our belief

that we have a system which works
and our decisions are final. And
we're not going to belabor that point.

That might have been UVa’s mistake.’

Phi: What have been the major changes in the honor system in
your four years at W&L?

Willis: I think there are more procedural things which have been
added, more of an attempt to find clarity. I think also, judging by
records I have been able to see, the number of cases is increasing.
The number of investigations is increasing drastically. It seems to
me that over the past four years, the job of enforcing the honor
system has become more tedious work. There is more of a concern,
“are we following strictly the White Book?”’

Phi: What do you perceive the student body’s opinion of the EC to
be? Do you believe there is a sentiment that the EC is ‘“‘out to get
people?”’

Willis: I hope not. We shied away from some of the scare tactics
that old ECs used. I think there is always some questioning by
students because we do have to do things in confidence.

Phi: Do you think the EC should set up a separate honor commit-
tee, consisting either of students-at-large or EC members?

Willis: I think because of the increase of cases in the past five
years, it definitely warrants some considerations. Personally, I’m
not inclined to say that there should be a separate honor council
from the student government basically because the honor system
gives the EC a lot of legitimacy.

Phi: If you were to write a letter of advice to next year’s EC,
what would you tell them?

Willis: That would depend on how many people are returning
from this year’s committee. This year, I’m the only person who’s
returning. The years when there was only one returning member,
that person became the Nestor, ( the wisest and oldest of the
Greeks in the Trojan war) he had to answer every question.
Something that I constantly forget is to focus on good relations with
faculty members and the townspeople. There’s got to be more in-
corporation of the law school in everything we do. Every year,
we're severing the law school and that’s a terrible thought. That in-
cludes the honor system, it shows all the more when they put out
their own yearbook, their own newspaper. Finally, I would tell the
committee to keep a pulse on the student body as far as how to
perceive honor. Yet have faith in the system and enforce it to the
best of their ability.

How To Fight High Phone Bills

by John Heckert

Once a month, usually in the
second or third week, almost
everyone at W&L receives a let-
ter from the Centel Telephone
Company. Small though the
envelope may be, it usually
creates quite an uproar, com-
plete with a promise ‘‘not to call
that Hollins ------ again!”’

In a survey of more than 20
phone-bill payers, the average
monthly phone bill was in the
$20-$30 range. The high was
somewhere near $200. If you
find yourself somewhere in this
class of talkaholics then read
on. By familiarizing yourself
with long distance charges you
can save a neat sum.

If it’s not completely
necessary, don’t use the
operator. Operator-handled

calls include collect, coin and

credit card calls. We all know
collect calling is the biggest
money saver, but that is an en-
tirely different ballgame. As a
general rule of thumb, dial
direct. If, after several direct-
dial attempts, the call still
doesn’t go through then the
operator will put it through for
you and charge the lower rate.
Think twice about calling
person-to-person. The rates are
double those of any other call.

If you are calling long
distance to a business, say for a
job interview, make certain to
check for the WATS (Wide Area
Telecommunications Service)
‘800’ number, which can be
called toll-free.

If, during a call, you get a
wrong number, poor connection
or the line is cut off, call the
operator immediately so as not

to be billed.

Part of the problem that W&L
students face is the fact that
many of their calls are in-state
and long distance. There is
nothing to be done but suffer
these high rates. One benefit
Centel provides is ‘‘conference”’
calls wherein you can have a
multi-person conversation pro-
vided one person is calling long
distance.

Long distance rates are
reduced at different time of the
day. On weekdays before 5
p.m., full rates apply. After 5
p.m. they are cut by 35 percent.
At 11 p.m. rates are cut again
by another 25 percent making
the full reduction 60 percent.
This 60 percent cut is also good
on weekends prior to5 p.m.

Certain holidays of the year
also have reduced rates. Those

include New Year’s Day, July
4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiving
and Christmas. On those days,
the evening reduction rate ap-
plies to all direct-dial calls for
the entire day. On out of state
operator assisted calls, this rate
applies only to additional

   

€ typical habitat of the talkaholic. —

minutes.

If you follow these sugges-
tions and perhaps consider how
long you’re actually talking for

the amount you’re spending,

then your phone bill can be

reduced.

John Read: From Vietnam To Lexington

by Tom Baker

John Read’s personal history
sounds like something out of a
war movie witha happy ending.

After graduating from the
Virginia Military Institute in 1965
with a B.A. in history, Read began
a military career that he hoped
would culminate with his becom-
ing a general in the U.S, Army.

Read Vietnam,
however, and on New Year's Eve
1967, was shot three times by an
AK-47 rifle and spent three mon-
ths in hospitals in Vietnam and

went lo

Tokyo recovering. He was then
discharged from the Army for
medical reasons after being pro-
moted to Captain, and- awarded
the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.
His hopes of becoming a career
Army officer wiped out, Read em-
barked on a career in law by
entering Washington and Lee's
School of Law. To this day he is
“very grateful” to President
Huntley and the Law School for
allowing “a B to €C student” com-
ing out of an undergraduate pro-
gram not known for its history
department to study at W&L.

Regardless of his background,
Read attained a large amount of
success while at W&L Law School.
He was president of the Student
Law Association, and belonged to
Omicron Delta Kappa as well as
Who's Who.

After graduation, Read practic-
ed private law for several years
and in 1975 was elected to serve as
the Commonwealth's Attorney for
Rockbridge County and the city
of Lexington, a position which he
continues to hold.

One aspect of local government
that most Washington and Lee
students are ignorant of despite
its importance is the Com-
monwealth Attorney’s office.

The current Commonwealth
Attorney, Beverly C. ‘John’
Read has several respon-
sibilities within the local
judiciary system. Read is, in his
own words, “responsible for
prosecuting felony criminal
matters that occur within the ci-
ty of Lexington as well as
Rockbridge County.”

Read is responsible for pro-

secuting any and all misde-
meanor matters which he
deems to be appropriate. The
Commonwealth’s Attorney also
prosecutes serious game viola-
tions and any cases that a vic-
tim of a crime or police officer
asks him to handle.

The most common violation
of law that Washington and Lee
students experience is the
break-in or theft of property.
The Commonwealth Attorney’s
office has an established pro-
cedure that it follows in order to
prosecute in these matters.

Upon being informed by a stu-
dent that there has been a
break-in, the police investigate
the scene of the crime, follow-
ing the standard procedures of
taking fingerprints, making an
inventory of stolen items and
then beginning a general in-
vestigation of the crime. There
are usually few leads as to the
suspect in a crime like this, but
the police and the Com-
monwealth Attorney have
several sources to turn to.

Both parties maintain a list of
possible suspects and they also
maintain contacts with what
Read referred to as ‘‘people of a
Slimey nature’ around Lex-
ington. Over the years Read has
enlisted a group of informants
at what he terms the ‘grass
roots level.’’

After a suspect is discovered,
he is questioned, with arrests
possibly resulting.

Concerning his association
with the university, Read feels
he has a “‘very good relation-
ship” with W&L. He has a
“tremendous amount of
respect” for both the students
and faculty.

He noted, however, that there
are exceptions. He finds a
‘“‘very low percentage’’ of the
students do get involved in
serious incidents that involve
more than drinking or noise
violations. Among these
students, Read is primarily con-
cerned with those that use and
sell narcotics.

Despite what students might

Washington and Lee University
on Thursday, February 5 to ad-
dress Military Science
students and other interested

members of the campus com-
munity. Col. Pond’s topic was
the Officer Personnel
Management System. That title
encompasses such subjects as
the identification, selection,

procurement, training, assign-
ment, evaluation, and promo-
tion of Army officers — subjects
of high interest to a score of
W&L men who shortly will
become Second Lieutenants. In
a period of changing defense

debate on how to obtain enough
qualified soliders for the
Volunteer Army, Col. Pond’s
presentation was of significant
interest as _ well to
many concerned members of
the campus and community.

Colonel Pond is a Regular Ar-
my Infantry officer with over
twenty-two years’ commission-
ed service. He has _ served
overseas tours in Panama and
South East Asia, and stateside
with the 3rd Infantry (Old
Guard) at Ft. Myer, VA, and as
commander of the 1st Battalion,
29th Infantry at Ft. Benning,
GA. He is an Airborne Ranger
who has earned the Combat In-
fantry Badge and numerous
awards and decorations. Col-
onel Pond earned his

yo"

undergraduate degree from the
University of Nebraska and a
Master’s Degree in Education
from Georgia State University.
He also attended Emory
University’s Advanced
Management Program. Colonel
Pond is a graduate of the Ar-
my’s Command and General
Staff College and the National
War College.

Lt. Col. Thomas B. Baughn,
Professor of Military Science at
the University, commented
upon the programed event, ‘‘We
are especially fortunate to have
Colonel Pond visit us. He is an
outstanding infantryman and
an outstanding military person-
nel manager. I look forward toa
first-rate presentation and a
lively, informative question and
answer period.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Weeknight Parties

With the approach of Fancy Dress midweek par-
ties, we hear new rumblings from the faculty concer-
ning ‘‘legitimacy”’ of such events. The question is
whether or not student organizations (fraternities,
IFC, SAB, SABU, EC) should be ‘‘allowed’”’ to sponsor
midweek parties. Past University Council pro-
nouncements ruled that no such party could take
place; the rationale being that students would suffer
adverse effects (hangover?) from pressure to attend
these parties. The consequences of such a paternal
decree include (1 the new prevalent pitch-in parties
and (2 more frequent road trips to parties sponsored
by surrounding schools. The pitch-in effort is a suc-
cessful evasive measure which going DTR invovles
long travel time — some which is late at night.

While it seems that professors may have genuine
concern of the welfare and academic awareness of
students, it is absurd to think that faculty evaluation
of students’ social lives will improve a students abili-
ty to make his own decisions. Of prime importance is
that W&L purports to be an institution which en-
courages maximum freedom for the student in all his
endeavors. It is a contradiction for this liberal institu-
tion to regulate the otherwise legal social choices of
students. College should not shelter a student from
real world decision making but should urge the
autonomy to make responsible, informed decisions.
As one W&L professor has quoted ‘‘A liberally
educated man is one who knows the consequences of
his actions and the sum total of their relationships.”’
In order to uphold this tenet, a student or his organiza-
tion should have the freedom and option to sponsor
social events whenever they feel it prudent.

In light of the midweek SAB Fancy Dress party, we
are pleased such school-wide events are allowed. Fur-
ther, we abhor any attempt by the faculty to impose
social values upon student organizations. An educa-

tion goes beyond the classroom and includes the total
life experience, especially the cultivation of the
capacity for one to make responsible decisions for

himself.
Hazing

Well, it looks like it’s that time of the year again, all
over campus we See fraternity pledges dressed to the
hilt, answering questions with yes sir, no sir, or main-
taining total silence. Yes, once again it is time for
fraternity initiation — the time when the “‘brothers’’
make pledges into real live actives. And once again,
we feel obligated to warn the pledges that initiation
may not be all that they think it might be. We are
referring, of course, to hazing, a rather unkind prac-

tice.
A few examples from recent history come to mind

and illustrate the types of things pledges should not
have to go through to become active brothers. One

practice is several hours of forced drinking followed
by a physical workout resembling grass drills in foot-
ball and ending with a chewing tobacco swallowing
contest. Another practice is lining pledges up outside
in the snow and freezing temperatures and spraying
them down with a hose. The list goes on but we simply
want to make one point — a pledge will not become a
better brother or person because he has been degrad-
ed through hazing. Hazing is certainly a despicable
practicewhich benefits neither the fraternity involved
nor the pledge who suffers.

Don’t Renounce The Deal

Dear Editor:

I am writing in response to a
letter in last week’s Phi titled
“Renounce the Deal.’’ While I
certainly do not oppose
criticism of Iran for its crude
treatment of our hostages, I
cannot adhere to Mr. Rudder’s
conclusion that Ronald Reagan
should renege on the agreement
which set the hostages free. Mr.
Rudder warns us about the
dangers of establishing a prece-
dent which honors agreements
that have been made with “‘bar-
barians;” however, welching

on the Iranian agreement would
establish an even more
dangerous precedent.

First of all, reneging on any
international agreement would
cause considerable damage to
our national reputation. There
can be no question that what the
Iranians did was wrong;
however, why should we further
aggravate the situation and at
the same time prove to the
world that our word in an inter-
national agreement is not worth
the paper that it is written

upon? Furthermore, our coun-
try was not the only party in the
agreement with Iran; Algeria,
West Germany and England’s
largest bank all played decisive
roles in the release of the
hostages. Reneging on the
agreement would place all of
these countries in a very em-
barassing position.

The reasons not to renege on
the agreement go beyond mere
expedience, however. It is
ironic that such a staunch sup-
porter of Ronald Reagan as Mr.
Rudder would even suggest that
Ronald Reagan welch on the
agreement. Throughout his
campaign Reagan loudly extoll-
ed the virtues of the American
character, Reagan has sought
to re-establish America’s
reputation as a land of honest,
hard-working people. America
the free, America the brave,
America the land of the people
who do not keep their word?
This description simply does
not fit the man’s image, or his
campaign rhetoric. For Reagan
the choice should be simple. It
is between irrational
belligerence and _ national
honor, hypocrisy and personal
| integrity. If Regean decides to
uphold the agreement, America
may be on its way to a ‘“‘new
beginning.” If Reagan re-
nounces the deal, he will have
sacrificed our national honor
simply to make life difficult for
Iran and perhaps be the subject
of another critical work of jour-
nalism. A catchy title soon
comes to mind: The President
Who Failed, Volume Two.

Henry. P. Wall ’81
SAB Co-Chairman Elam

Responds To Student’s Criticism

Dear Editor:

In last week’s letter to the
editor entitled, “‘Student Cites
Mismanagement,’’ the author
stated, “It appears that this
year’s Student Activities Board
is having serious difficulties in
carrying out its awesome
responsibilities — the ad-
ministration of thousands of
dollars of student activity
funds.”” Unfortunately, what
has appeared to Mr. Welch, the
author, was no more than an ap-
parition and more likely a
hallucination.

Claims of mismanagement
against the Student Activities
Board are not only unfounded
but absolutely scurrilous. Mr.
Welch has only used the word

 

‘“‘mismanagement’’ to sensa-
tionalize what he must believe
is a non-sensational complaint.
I find this cheap shot not only
annoying but maddening.
Therefore I will answer his ac-
cusations and lay to rest any
further questions about the
operation of the SAB.

Mr. Welch’s accusation of
mismanagement of student
body funds is a gross mistake.
We have exact records of where
each and every cent was spent
and will be spent.

To be sure that student body
funds are being spent as they
should, the EC checks the ex-
penditures of every student
organization, including the
SAB, every month. Further-
more, these budget reports are
given to the Ring-tum Phi and
are open for examination by
any student, faculty member,
or administrator. As a final
check, Willie Mackie, Student
body Vice President, has com-
puter print-outs of all student
body accounts, including the
SAB’s, to verify all four
records. All of these checks in-
sure the proper management of
student body funds and serve to

prevent any form of
mismanagement.
Having used ‘‘mismanage-

ment” to sensationalize his let-
ter, Mr. Welch reveals his real
complaint, the publicity for
Winter Weekend. While I agree
that publicity for Winter
Weekend was not proper I do
believe it was.adequate.

First off, two weeks ago we
replaced our original publicity
chairman, Quinn Peeper, with
Len Howard. The move was
made to allow enough time for
Quinn to work on Fancy Dress.
The result was this left Len with
very little time to get the
publicity out. Furthermore, the
poster was not finished by the
print shop until Monday. It was
supposed to be ready by the
preceding Thursday.

These major complications,
along with a few more minor
ones kept the publicity from go-
ing up until Monday. Mr. Welch
may not have seen it until Tues-
day, but we can neither afford
the money nor the time to place
posters on every student’s door.

These posters were placed in
obvious locations on Monday.
Although the publicity was not

proper, it was adequate enough
to fill the pavilion.

Finally, Mr. Welch claims
that the SAB can find the tables
used to serve beer during
homecoming ‘right where it
left them — outside on the law
school field to rot all winter.”’ I
would hasten to warn Mr. Welch
to get his facts straight before

making accusations. This
claim, like all other claims in
his letter, is clearly false. The
SAB did not serve beer that
weekend. The party on the law
school field that did serve beer
and probably left the tables
there “‘to rot all winter’ was
sponsored by the EC, ODK and
the SBA. The only connection
the SAB had with the party was
that we loaned them the money
to pay for it.

In the future, I would hope
that Mr. Welch will get his facts
straight before making any ac-
cusations and voice only his
complaints and try not to sensa-
tionalize them. And if he wants
to talk tables, talk to those
responsible for them.

The SAB is a smooth running,
efficient organization. I have
trust and faith in each and
every officer and _ board
member. And I know that they
will do their jobs as they should
as I have and will also do. The
claim of mismanagement of
student body funds is a gross er-
ror.

president; and, Timothy J. Crimi, treasurer.

Nelson Ould, the president of
Sigma Chi, appeared at court
with Sisler. “We talked with
Mr. Sisler about the problem,”’
said Ould, ‘‘and we felt that we
did have a chance to win the
case, so we decided to contest
“

Sigma Chi eventually won
half of its case.

According to Ould, Sisler
pointed out how the noise or-
dinance was ambiguous. Ould,
who was individually charged
with the violation, was not par-
ticipating in the party and had
gone to bed sometime earlier.
Through this loophole, the first

charge was dropped.
Ould continued. ‘In the
future, the president, vice-

president, or the social chair-
man of the fraternity will be
charged as an agent of the cor-

But what is_ particularly
interesting about the case bet-
ween the three houses and the
city is that an amendment to the
ordinance is being attempted
with Sisler’s help.

‘‘One of the conditions that we
had when we hired Mr. Sisler
was that he was to help us get a
better working relationship bet-
ween the Lexington Police
Department and the frater-
nities,”’ said Ould. Ould also
stated that a group of fraternity
members from the IFC are
working up ideas for changing
the ordinance and are to meet
with Sisler to discuss the
options.

“The working relationship
right now is just not feasible
from our side,’’ added Ould.
Ould said he does see the
problem from both sides, that
the fraternities do need some
restriction in order to protect
the townspeople, but that the
times allowed by the permits
are not helpful.

Ould believes that one solu-
tion to the problem is to extend
the noise permit to 1 a.m. and to
allow a weeknight permit. ‘‘All

 

the fraternities could work with
that much easier and I think
that it would help,”’ said Ould.

The major problem, in Ould’s
opinion, is the city’s refusal to
issue noise permits on Wednes-
day nights. “That should be
changed,”’ said Ould. “I guess
you could say that by law, a
group of individuals are not
allowed to have a party on
Wednesday night.”’

Sisler refused to make any
comment about the case, saying
that “‘until the litigation is
finished, having any comments
on the matter in any type of
publication at this time would
not be good.”

When asked whether the
group of fraternity members
had approached him with ideas
for changing the ordinance,
Sisler replied that no one has
come up with alternatives yet,

but that another solution is:

being worked out.

The problem of the noise or-
dinance and noise permits con-
tinues to be a thorn in fraternity
members’ sides. However, an
answer may soon be found to
end the constant misunder-
standings of Lexington’s law.

1981 Ss

 

by John Wells

The number of local arrests
for breaking and entering and
larceny increased substantially
in 1980, according to a report by
Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby.

In a summary at the begin-
ning of the 21-page report, Kir-

    

by noted that the department in-
vestigated 54 break-ins and en-
tries last year, compared to 33
in 1979, an increase of 38 per-
cent. The number of reported
larcenies increased 26 percent.
Kirby said the amount of
goods stolen by breaking and
entering and larceny totaled

$76,661 and that his department
managed to recover $26,224 or
about one-third of the property
taken.

The number of juveniles
arrested in Lexington fell from
123 in 1979 to 100 last year. Ina
breakdown of figures, Kirby
called attention to what he con-

wo
Vi at

sidered “some of our most
serious crimes’: breaking and
entering (56 juveniles
charged); grand larceny (15
juveniles charged) ; and posses-
sion of drugs (1 juvenile
charged).

Kirby said some of the
juveniles brought to court were

repeat offenders.

The police chief said he took
pleasure in reporting that no
violent crimes ‘‘such as murder
or manslaughter’’ were
reported in 1980. Kirby did not
mention it in his summary, but
two instances of attempted

MD Superdance Raises
$22,000 In Pledges

by Steven Perry

For the third consecutive
year, Washington and Lee
University played host to a
dance marathon for Muscular
Dystrophy. An_ estimated
$22,000 was pledged to the M.D.
cause during the 30-hour Super-
dance.

150 dancers started the dance
marathon and 140 finished, an
increase of twenty finalists
from last year. Although less
money was pledged to the
benefit this year, Superdance
co-chairman Tripp Brower
believes that more of the money
will be collected.

Brower said that the help of 30
secretaries in compiling the
bills will result in a collecting

rate of over 90 percent, an in-

crease over last year’s 75 per-

cent.

In addition to the dancers,
more than 1,000 spectators
witnessed Superdance ’81 over
the course of the weekend.
Saturday night produced the
largest crowd, with over 700
people present.

As was promised, four
members of W&L’s administra-
tion fell victims to pie tosses:
Dean Atwood raised the most
money, with a winning bid of
$115. Ninety dollars was
pledged by Richard Drennen,
the remainder by Lexington
Mayor Charles Phillips.

Dr. Worth raised $85, and was
pegged by Jerry Darrell. Adlin
Goldstein offered $75 for the
chance to hit Dean Murphy, and

Chris Peacock paid $70 to nail
Ham Smith.

Bill Bourne won the grand
prize, a trip for two to Key
West, Florida. Bourne raised
the most money in pledges.

Mike Wyatt was the runner-
up, and received a free trip to
the Greenbriar. Wyatt was also
awarded the prize for the
largest cash donation.

For the first year, 22 hours of
the Superdance were filled with
live music. Hemby, master of
ceremonies of Superdance ’81,
said that the bands were quite
pleased with the crowds that
attended their performances.
Several of the bands were old
hands at doing benefit perfor-
mances.

John Barth Speaks
In Chapel Tonight

John Barth, widely acclaimed
as one of America’s best fiction
writers, will speak in Lee
Chapel on the Washington and
Lee University campus tonight
at8p.m.

Barth is a native of Cam-
bridge, Md., who received his
bachelor’s and _ master’s
degrees from Johns Hopkins
University and who is presently
professor of English and
creative writing at Johns
Hopkins.

A member of the National
Institute of Arts and Letters and

a fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences,
Barth won a National Book
Award in fiction in 1973 for
‘‘Chimera.”’ Other Barth works
include his latest, ‘‘Letters,’’
and earlier works such as
“Giles Goat-Boy,” ‘‘The Sot-
Weed Factor,’’ and ‘‘The
Floating Opera.”’

Barth’s appearance at W&L
is sponsored by ‘‘Contact,’’ the
symposium organized jointly by
the Interfraternity Council and
the W&L Student Government.

Breeze has performed several
‘times at reduced rates. Bassett
later remarked that he enjoyed
helping the dancers achieve
their goal and his performance
was ample evidence of his
enthusiasm.

The remaining eight hours of
dancing was provided by

When asked if he was disap-
pointed by the lower amount of
monev pledged this year then in
previous years, Hemby stated
that the Superdance has sur-
passed its goal of $20,000.
Hemby noted that ‘‘any amount
of money we can raise for these
people is enough.”’

pledges are being forced to pay
$2,900 for a tree that they cut
down from a local resident’s
yard to use as a Christmas tree
in their fraternity house.

The pledges were first caught
by the Lexington Police Depart-
ment when the police, with the
help of University Proctor
Charles Murray, matched the
rings of the tree in the house
with the rings of the stump of
the 20-foot high Norwegian
Spruce. The rings were actually
matched in the police forensic
lab in Roanoke.

The local resident, Mr. James
G. Dunlap of 959 Thorn Hill
Road, reached an agreement
with an attorney, James W.
Osborne, whom the pledges
hired. The tree will be replaced

with the expenses paid for by
the pledges.

Usually, an incident of this
sort results in a felony theft
charge. According to
Commonwealth’s Attorney
John Read, his office maintains
a policy that, because the
pledges were able to reach an
agreement with Mr. Dunlap
over the replacement of the
tree, charges were not filed.

Mr. Dunlap also stated that
he was willing to reach an
agreement and not press
charges because he did not
want to see the pledges having
to face trial over the incident.

The Phi Kappa Sigma Frater-
nity was;“according to fraterni-
ty president Rob Brooke,
avoiding the situation and
allowing the pledges to work out
the situation on their own.

(continued from page 1)
rape/sodomy were reported
last year for the first time since
1977, when one case was
reported.

Traffic accidents went down
by one, from 217 to 216. This
marks a continuing downward
trend since 1976, when the
figure was 247. Accident-related
property damage declined 15
percent to $22,248. Kirby ex-
plained that 11 percent of all
drivers in accidents had been
drinking.

The following violations
showed a marked increase over
the previous year; trespassing,
from 15 cases to 37; possession
of controlled drugs, from 7
cases to 15; drunk in public,
from 302 cases to 363; and
reckless driving, from 92 cases
to 104.

The number of persons
charged with drinking in public
decreased from 17 cases to six.
There were also declines in
some traffic violation
statistics: speeding tickets
went down to 174 from the 1979
figure of 295 and a high of 587 in
1977. Cases of parking in a
restricted zone went down from
783 cases to 768.

Although no mention was
made of it in the report, the
department faced some staffing
problems in 1980. The situation
was discussed at the last city
council meeting and in an inter-
view with City Manager John V.

Doane.

‘We had some _ turnover,

which I would not characterize
as unusual,”’ said Doane. ‘‘We
did have one continuous vacan-
cy for about six months.”
Doane said that the department
is now fully staffed.

Finally, the police chief

offered a list of services provid-
ed by the police in addition to
regular duties:

— During 1980 the depart-
ment checked citizens’ homes
while out of town for a period of
time. Checks are made random-
ly three times a week, involving
40 homes a day.

— Escorts are provided for
banks twice weekly when
transporting large amounts of
money to the bank or to the post
office for shipment.

— Doctors and nurses are
provided transportation, when
no other means is available,
when there is an emergency
situation at the hospital.

— Escorts are provided for
merchants as they make night
deposits after heavy shopping
days.

— Forty-two burglar alarms
from various businesses are in-
stalled at the police depart-
ment, keeping the dispatcher
constantly on the alert.

— The department assists
citizens (‘‘at least one call per
week’’) who have locked their
keys in their car.

 

— The department finger-

prints approximately 150 law
students, cadets and others for
various reasons.

— The department helps start

citizen’s cars late at night when
no mechanic is available ‘‘and
even looks for lost pets.”’

“We are glad to perform

these duties,’’ wrote Kirby. “I
feel good public relations be-
tween the community and the
police department are impor-
tant.”’

City Manager John Doane
said the report contains no sur-
prises. ‘‘It confirmed pretty
much what I’d been aware of,”
he said, ‘regarding trends in
criminal and non-criminal ac-
tivity. Of course I'm concerned
about the number of robberies,
breaking and enterings and
various juvenile problems. I
don’t think the statistics reflect
the relatively successful efforts
of the department in apprehen-
ding these perpetrators.

“I would characterize the
report as fairly routine infor-
mation, a useful analyzer of
trends and needs. I can’t
evaluate the effectiveness of the
department in terms of the
report alone, but their success
in dealing with major offenses
compares pretty favorably with
other city departments in the
state.”’

  

night's meeting.

The IFC discusses the fraternity maintenance pi ogram at Tuesday

 

Fraternities Can Expect
Lower Maintenance Costs

by Mike Perry
Dean of Fraternity Affairs
Dan Murphy told _Inter-
fraternity Council represen-
tatives they can expect the total
cost of the University
Maintenance Program to be

reduced by $8,000 for the 1980-81 »

school year. Savings to each
fraternity will vary in propor-
tion to their use of the program.

Murphy explained to the IFC
that he met with University
Treasurer Stewart Epely, and
Director of Building and
Grounds Arthur to review the
maintenance program’s first
six months of operation and pro-
ject the program’s 1980-81 cost
will be approximately $8,000

less than the $42,000 which was
previously estimated.

IFC President Monty Briscoe
announced that the IFC is plan-
ning to sponsor workshops for
fraternity presidents,
treasurers and food managers.

In other business, the IFC
Judicial Board questioned
representatives from the Sigma
Nu, Sigma Chi, and Phi Kappa
Psi fraternities regarding
funding of a joint Wednesday
night party. The fraternity
representatives assured the
IFC Judicial Board that funds
for the band and beer were
“chipped in’ by those in-
dividuals attending the party.

NEWS BRIEFS: Topless Jogging And A Record

Love Behind Bars

From Attica Prison, we have
the heartwarming news that
David Berkowitz, otherwise
known as ‘The Son of Sam,”
has fallen in love. The only pro-
blem is that Berkowitz’s in-
tended is a he and not a she.

Prison officials report that
Berkowitz’s object of affection
is fellow inmate Louis Quires, a
25 year-old transsexual. Quires,
who calls himself ‘‘Diane,”’ has
taken hormones and_ had
silicone implanted in his chest,
but prison officials have refused
to grant him a_ sex-change
operation.

Quires was moved to another
prison shortly after Berkowitz

apparently became enamored
of him.

Cat-Nipped

From Clifton Park, N.Y.,
comes this report of a feline
who overimbibed himself.

A couple was sleeping one
night when it was awakened by
the sound of its pet cat yelping.
The couple walked into the
living room where it discovered
the black-and-white beast flopp-
ing around and foaming at the
mouth, The couple immediately

rushed the cat to the local
veterinarian where the pro-
gnosis was given. Distemper?
No, drunk. Apparently, the cat
had knocked over a bottle of
bourbon in the kitchen while
prowling for food. The result: a
$77 bill for the owners and one
bad hangover for the cat.

The Naked Truth

Art and beauty are in the eyes
of “the beholder, or at least
that’s the opinion of the mayor
of McCall, Idaho.

At the recent annual McCall
Winter Festival, a_ local
sculptor had submitted a.
replica of the Mannekin Pis

statue carved in ice. Only one
thing bothered the festival com-
mittee, however, that being the
statue’s representation of a
naked body.

So on the afternoon that the
ice sculpture was supposed to
be put on display, a front-end
loading truck ran over the
sculpture. At least there was
enough ice for everyone.

Bustin-Out

From San Quinton Prison
comes the word that two con-

victs who escaped from the
prison in 1979 using a home-
made canoe, have for the se-
cond time in two months.
escaped the wrath of the jury.

The two suspects, both serv-
ing time for robbery, attempted
an escape from San Quentin
using a canoe made from wood
and plastic sheets. To convince
the guards, the inmates
painted ‘‘Rub-Dub-a-Dub,
Marin Yacht Club” on the-side
of the boat. One guard in the
prison’s watch tower was so
convinced of the canoe’s
authenticity that he hailed the
vessel, but only to see if tne two
paddlers were all right.

The two would-be escapees
said yes, and paddled on.

Topless Jogging

At a recent meeting, the Palm
Beach, Fla., town council
decided once again to address
the problem of topless joggers.
More specifically, the council
wanted to speak out against the
“unsightly problem of hairy
chested men jogging shirtless”’
through the streets of the af-
fluent community.

Palm Beach drew up a
“topless jogger”’ ordinance in
1979, but the ordinance was

ruled down as unconstitutional
by Florida courts. A revised
ban is scheduled to be drawn up
by the town council.

Record Hunt

The 1980 fall hunt season was
a record year for hunters who
killed 75,120 deer and posted

‘tags for 10,748 turkeys. Super-

vising game biologist in the
Charlottesville office of the
Commission of Game and—In-
land Fisheries Jack V. Gwynn
had predicted a total kill of
75,258 deer. One year Gwynn
missed the kill by only one
animal. And Gwynn may still
not be too far off since tags for
the kill usually come in about
one week after the season.

Visit Iran?

Looking for a fun and exciting
vacation? Why not Iran? Iran’s
second most, powerful religious
leader says that foreigners
could visit Iran without fear of
being taken hostage, but has
omitted information regarding
prisoners held in Iran’s jails.

The chief justice of the Ira-
nian Supreme court and leader
of the ruling Islamic

Republican Party Says any
foreigner who enters Iran with
a valid visa will be safe.
However, safety will only be
guaranteed as long asthe stay is
not in any way damaging to our
revolution. Sounds like a real
vacation bargain.

Faculty Members Placed On Revisions Committee

by W. Cope Moyers

The Executive Committee
moved one step closer to revis-
ing the White Book Monday
night when it approved a motion
including faculty members on
the White Book subcommittee.

The committee’s action
erases one of the final obstacles
before the subcommittee, which
will soon begin to review the
honor system and attempt to
revise those parts of the code it
thinks need to be changed.

Approval followed discussion
on whether members of the
faculty should be considered ad-
ministrators and thus, eligible
for membership on the sub-
committee. The EC had initially
favored only including two ad-
ministrators from the universi-

ty along with the three EC
members and three ‘students
that will also serve on the sub-
committee.

But at Monday night’s
meeting, EC member Jeff Ed-
wards’ motion including faculty
on the subcommittee was
approved 7-4, with Willie
Mackie, Bud White, Mike
Nogay and Ben Hale voting
against it.

Edwards’ motion followed the
committee’s rejection of
Marshall Clark’s motion that
would have considered the
faculty as administrators,
clearing the way for their inclu-
sion on the White Book subcom-
mittee and more importantly,
giving them the power to vote

on any recommendations the
subcommittee sends to the EC.
Clark’s motion was rejected as
all but three committee
members voted against it.
Clark, Jim Vines and President
Bob Willis were the only ones in
favor of the motion.

Mackie attempted to give the
committee tighter control over
which faculty members serve
on the subcommittee when he
made a motion requiring a two-
thirds approval of the full EC or
any faculty member that is a
candidate for the White Book
committee.

“This is serious business
revising the White Book,”’
Mackie said. ‘‘If we are going to
involve the faculty, we have to
examine them closer.”’

But the motion failed 3-8 with
Mackie, White and Nogay
voting in favor of the controver-
sial suggestions.

In other business, EC Presi-
dent Bob Willis announced that
petitions for the Big Three elec-
tions are due by March 3, along
with 150 signatures. Elections
for these three positions will
follow on March 9.

By March 16, petitions with 50
signatures are due for can-
didates running for class offices
and Executive Committee posi-
tions. Elections will be held one
week later.

The committee agreed to hold
the vote on the proposed con-
stitutional amendment change
February 24-26. The amend-

Survey Shows Freshman Career Plans

Nearly 30 percent of the
freshmen at Washington and
Lee University plan a career in
law, according to results of a
survey taken last fall among
entering students at W&L and
354 other colleges and univer-
sities throughout the nation.

Asked to indicate their
“probable career occupation,”’
29.9 percent of the W&L
freshmen surveyed selected the
“lawyer (attorney) or judge’
category. The national average
is 4.1 percent for all freshmen at
all the colleges which took part
in the study.

In past years, law has been
the leading career choice
among W&L freshmen in this
survey. Of those freshmen who
enrolled in the fall of 1979 and
took part in that survey, 25 per-
cent said they intend to become
lawyers.

The second most popular
career choice of the W&L
freshmen was ‘“‘business ex-
ecutive,’’ which was the choice
of 17.9 percent (as compared
with 10.1 percent on a national
basis).

Next came ‘‘physician,’’ with
13.6 percent of the W&L
freshmen selecting that career
(contrasted with 3.5 percent
nationally).

= SF Se =,

Monday.

Following those. three
categories were ‘‘writer or jour-
nalist,’’ which received 4.9 per-
cent response and ‘‘engineer’’
at 3.7 percent.

The survey was directed by
the Graduate School of Educa-
tion at UCLA, on behalf of the
American Council on Education
(ACE).

Law, business, and medicine
have been the leading career
choices at Washington and Lee
for the past decade or more,
according to these annual ACE
surveys.

As usual, a vast majority
—88.1 percent, to be specific
—of the freshmen surveyed in-
dicated that W&L’s ‘‘good
academic reputation’ was a
“very important” reason in the
decision to enroll in the school.
In the national survey of all 355
institutions, 50.8 percent of the
respondents checked ‘‘good
academic reputation” as their
reason for enrolling.

And also as usual, the W&L
freshmen characterized
themselves as politically con-
servative to a larger extent
than their peers around the
nation. At W&L, 42 percent in-
dicated that their political
orientation was conservative;
nationally, only 17 percent

chose conservative as_ their
political orientation. (The
Statistic for males in private
undergraduate colleges was
20.2 percent).

In response to several ques-
tions dealing with current social
concerns, 77.4 percent of the
W&L freshmen said they agree
(strongly or somewhat) that in-
flation is the biggest domestic
problem, 68 percent felt women
should be subject to the draft;
80.8 percent felt the Federal
government should do more to
discourage energy consump-
tion; 96.3 percent said all
college graduates should be

able to demonstrate some
minimal competency in written
English and mathematics,
while 29.7 percent agreed with
busing for school integration
and 24.1 percent favored
abolishing the death penalty.

As for their college expecta-
tions, 63.7 percent estimated the
chances are ‘“‘very good”’ that
they will join a social fraternity’
47 percent felt they will make at
least a ‘‘B” average; 67.7 per-
cent expect to be satisfied with
college; 17.2 percent anticipate
a change in career choice; and,
engaging in wishful thinking
perhaps, since W&L is an all-
male school, 1.6 percent expect
to live in a coeducational dorm.

ment, which would reduce the
number of students required to
vote from the present 3/4 to 20
percent, is intended to make it
easier for changes in the stu-
dent body constitution to occur.
Proposed amendments will still
need 75 percent of the ballots
cast before approval.

Two subcommittees made
monthly reports to the commit-
tee. The Phi reported that ex-
penses for issues 13-17 were
$1,290.46 and revenues
amounted to $3,166.20. The Cold
Check Committee reported that
about $467 had been collected
from students who had written
bad checks and that about $282
had also been collected from
former students.

Superdance: Bop til you Drop

by M. Shaw Pyle

It started three years ago
when W&L_ student Jay
Blumberg managed to create a
charity out of the void. Or
perhaps it started last year,
when W&L’s second Super-
dance made a tradition of an
innovation. But for most pur-
poses, planning for the 3rd An-
nual Washington and Lee
Muscular Dystrophy Super-
dance began in September of
1980 with an organizational
meeting that brought lots of
strangers away from their
books for a few hours; hours
which ended with a team of
friends where strangers had
been so recently. s

That September night was the
first in a series of meetings that
lasted every Sunday of classes
until January; in January, a
Thursday night meeting was
added to the weekly schedule.
These weekly meetings of the
Steering Committee required
the chairmen and often the
assistant chairmen to fake

hours away from books, black- |

jack, and bowl games to work
on a task that frequently
seemed both vain and infinite.

Beyond these few hours, in-.

dividual committees spent
many an additional night work-
ing patiently and quickly
toward...the Main Event.
Thursday night, February 5.
A final meeting to firm up all
the arrangements so patiently
and painstakingly created in
the preceding months. Minor
disasters: no lights, no mikes.
Feverish activity ensues;
scavenging turns up some last-
minute systems. The poster
designed to go over the door is
unfinished. The beer is going to
be tight. Team effort is
promised for the morrow.
Friday, February 6. The
promised teamwork
materializes. All morning,
crews work on transforming the
dining hall into a ballroom. The
afternoon sees the offices set up
for the finance people, who are
painting posters while enter-
tainment people work on
registration. After dinner, the
dining hall is finally emptied of

chairs and tables. The ring for
the dancers is set up. Sound and
light systems are checked over.
The first pledge sheets trickle in
and the adding machines begin
to chatter. Eight o’clock: Presi-
dent Huntley kicks off the
marathon. Gate receipts and
beer money mount. Food and
Refreshment chairman Nils
Herdelin begins his lifesaving
distribution of coffee to the
workers. Nine o'clock sees the
first hourly total: too low? The:
chairmen start to sweat, but
finance chairman Phil Browne
insists on conservative
estimates. J. Hemby and Tripp
Brower infect the crew and
crowds with a _ contagious
energy. The adding machines
rattle on. Slowly, the totals
begin to show signs of life.
Attendance is low at the gate;
sweat glistens on a few finan-
cial brows. Everything slows
down as the night falls into mor-
ning: only the music and the ad-
ding machines are awake.

Saturday, February 7. The
totals slowly rise. The dancers,
too, are rising a little more
slowly; blisters, headaches and
exhaustion are reaching
epidemic proportions. There‘s
hardly a spectator left, and
morale is beginning to falter.
Through the fog, the dancers
dimly hear an equally tired J.
Hemby announce a_ two-hour
break. Four a.m. never looked
so good.

By six, the dancers are back
on the floor, and staff is again
manning the _ barricades.
Herdelin is working’ on
breakfast, Townsend Oast and
Ed Kramer are coordinating
the sound and light to wake up
the dancers, and the adding
machines are still going. Hem-
by and Brower are floating in
caffeine. Bluegrass is better
than sleep, right, guys?

Oast is sweating. Brower is
sweating. Hemby is too tired to
sweat. The reggae band is late.
Very late. Too late; Oast cuts to
tapes. Knock, knock. It’s the
reggae band.

Silence, no; but even above
the bands there seems to be a
sound missing. The adding

machines are off. Brower and
this reporter relax and start on
another gallon or so of coffee..
The pledges are tabulated, and
Carole Chappel and the W&L
secretaries have donated their
time to handle the billing.
Finance is on autopilot;
registration is able to breathe.
Herdelin, the chairmen, and T.

Oast (‘‘Toast’’ to his friends)
are the only ones still running
hard. Lunch passes swiftly and
then the dancing resumes.
Dancing and_ breaks.
Dancing. Breaks. Dancing and
dinner, and the spectators begin
to stumble in. Cautious op-
timism begins to replace the
alternate euphoria and despair
of finance; the numbers are

there. Entertainment and the ~
co-chairs are the only folks still -

scrambling; everyone else is
skating.

Even the dancers, townies,
profs’ families: Minks, Keydets,
and Superdance staffers, still

Sunday, February 8. Anxiety
is obvious; the totals on the

dance. The final total goes up on

This machine has_ been
around for at least 3 years. Un-
fortunately nothing is known
about it at all due to the fact
that Big John is the only one to
have ever played it. He literally
lives in front of this machine.
Seriously, rumor has it that it is

Xenon

This machine, the newest
among all of the machines in
the Cockpit, is entertaining to
watch if not to play. The psycho-
suggestive aspect of this
machine (a voice synthesizer
alternately moans ‘‘OOOH”’
and signs ‘‘AAH’’ thus making
it pleasing to both genders)
scarcely needs to be com-
mented upon. The thrill of
“entering Xenon” and trying a
‘‘tube shot’’ speak for
themselves. Suffice it to say
that the flippers are referred to
as “‘thrusters.’’ If Freud were
alive today...

If you have had a really bad
week, if you need some action —
only action — play this
machine. Be prepared to spend
at least two hours for every
quarter you feed this
remarkably generous machine.
While there is a lot. of dead
space on this machine it is im-
possible not to win free games.
Multiplier, specials and extra
balls are all cumulative. It’s
that simple. Free game at
200,000 points.

All the pinball machines are 3
ball games and give 1 credit
for 1 quarter and 3 credits for 2
quarters (with the exception of
Xenon which is 1 play per
quarter).

Many people, claiming to be
purists, prefer the tangible
aspects of the standard pinball
machines. They claim that
playing video games is a rather
vacuous experience — not
unlike taking a shower in a rain-
coat. While such criticisms are
rather extreme, there are some
problems with this new form of
entertainment. First of all, time
cannot be taken in between
players as it can on a pinball
machine. More importantly,
you can never win a free game
— only an ‘‘extended play.”’ It is
in this sense that video games
are akin to cancer — you know
that you cannot beat it, the only
question is seeing how long you
can hang on. Nevertheless

  

 

these machines have become
increasingly popular and now
command the lion’s share of the
market.
Space Invaders

This is the machine that
started the whole video craze.
While its popularity has
diminished somewhat, it still
has a very loyal following which
will line up for what seems like
hours to play. It’s very easy —
using your barriers, destroy the
alien ships before they destroy
you. Very simple. Often very
expensive. Extra ‘“‘bonus laser”’
at 1500 points.

Galaxian

For many people this is the
machine. It is not unlike Space
Invaders, but with an added
dimension. While you try to
destroy the alien ships, they are
advancing and diving on you.
Hit two yellows and a red in
convoy and 800 points are yours.
Look out for the purple ships
and try to stay out of the

‘corners. Extra ship at 7,000

points.

MonacoG.P.

A rather juvenile game, this
machine is usually played by
only townies or freshmen. Any
serious student of reckless
driving will put his quarters
towards a six-pack and opt for
the road to Briar or Macon on a
foggy, rainy night. Anything
else pales in comparison.
Besides, it is too loud and ob-
noxious for such a pip-squeak
machine. Extra game at 2,000
points.

Asteroids

Although many people avoid
this game (for some its rather
austere white-on-black motif
renders it chromatically boring
if not downright hideous), it is
the staple of many video buffs.
Requiring a rather large degree
of dexterity and eye-to-hand
coordination, for many it has
become heir to the Space In-
vaders legacy. You get three
ships; hit the small ‘stroids and
deal on the flying saucers, and
the extra ship is yours.

Note: This is the third in a series
of articles by Sports Editor Ralph
Frasca.

Boyd Williams, long-time
assistant coach of the
Washington and Lee football
team, is the subject of this
week’s interview. Williams
spent a year with the
Philadelphia Eagles during
their glory years, when legends
such as Pete Pihos and Steve
Van Buren made the Eagles a
dominant force in the NFL.

Williams went to Syracuse
University during the war-torn
1940’s. Upon graduation he
joined the Richmond Rebels, a
minor league football team
which had a working agreement
with the Pittsburgh Pirates
(who have since changed their
name to the Steelers). Williams

Sports

The Football Career

Of Boyd Williams

spent the 1946 season with the
Rebels, where his dogged play
as a lineman attracted the at-
tention of pro scouts. Subse-
quently, the Philadelphia
Eagles purchased his contract.

Williams spent the entire 1947
with Philly, seeing action at
offensive center and defensive
linebacker (gridiron athletes
played two-way back then).

However, Williams’ primary
interest lay in the coaching
aspect of football.

“I’ve wanted to be a coach
since I was young,’’ he recalled.
‘Tt just couldn’t get . into
coaching fast enough. A good
coach needs playing experience
in his sport, though, and I
wanted to play in the pros for a
little while. All I wanted was a
small dose of medicine as a
player, which I assumed would
be sufficient in my search for

Matmen Get Troun

knowledge of coaching tech-
niques.”’

Williams could not have
learned from a more proficient
mentor than Eagles’ coach
Greasy Neale, now enshrined in
the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

“Greasy taught me to com-
pete. He used to tell me, ‘You’ve
got to work hard and be
dedicated, because someone is
out to beat you every day.’
Philadelphia had a_ great
organization, and, I was
priviledged to be a part of it.”

Williams married, and then
returned to the Rebels in 1948.
After the season, he was offered
the head coaching job of the
VMI football team. After a two-
year stint at the military school,
he assumed a similar post at the
University of Richmond. In
1954, he was lured to W&L to
revitalize a sagging football

_team, which had been scarred

as a result of a major cheating
scandal the previous year.
Prior to the scandal, W&L was a
major college football team in
Division I, having produced
such outstanding players as Bill
Chipley, Mike Boyda, and
current Jets’ head coach Walt
Michaels, as well as playing in
the Gator Bowl.

As a result of the scandal, the
1954 football schedule was
cancelled, and_ grant-in-aid
scholarships were abolished.

“The athletic department
asked me to come in and
reorganize the football team.
Well, I managed to get enough
players together, and we played
four games on the JV level,”
said Williams.

The Generals reappeared on the
varsity level in 1955, but this
time they participated on the
Division III level. The policy of

Pembroke Invitational

by John Harrison

The W&L wrestling team was
abruptly brought back to reality
last Saturday, as it began the
last month of the season by be-
ing totally outclassed by a
strong field in the Pembroke
State (N.C.) Invitational. As a
result, the Generals lost what
momentum they had picked up
in two duel meet victories at the
end of January in what proved
to be a disappointing anc
frustrating situation.

Duke, South Carolina, and the
hosting school, which has four
Division II All-Americans, kept
the Generals from ever serious-
ly challenging for a finish in one
of the top spots. With the excep-
tion of heavyweight Carlton

Peebles, the only General to
come up with a win, Richard
Kopleman, Tim Valliere and
captain Dave Stoeffel were the
only others who were ever in
their matches.

Coach Gary Franke had a
straightforward explanation for
the team’s performance: ‘‘We
came up pretty flat. It was a
disappointing showing and it’s
obvious we didn’t do a good
job.”’ Coach Franke added that
it was indicative of how the
team has done against Division
I and II competition. ‘‘Our pro-
blem was that in the classes
that we matched up fairly well,
we not only lost but were
pinned. That really hurt us in
the standings for team points.”’

The Generals held their final
home match last night in
Warner Center, a duel meet
with James Madison. The
Dukes are a strong contender
for the state Division I cham-
pionship. The season will end
next weekend with Friday and
Saturday duel meets at David-
son and Catawba.

The season will be extended
at least one week for freshmen
Valliere (158) and Peebles.
They will be competing in the
Division III Eastern Regionals
Saturday the 20th in Salisbury,
Maryland. The regionals are
the first step towards the
National Championships in
Cleveland, Ohio.

 

 

no longer offering scholarships
hurt the athletic program, the
effects of which plagued the
sports program for some time.

Williams was originally
slated to do nothing more than
rebuild the team, but the
coaching techniques to which he
was so dedicated earned him a
post as the assistant coach in
charge of defensive linemen, a
position which he has held to
this day. “‘I consider myself for-
tunate to be at a school like
Washington and Lee,”’ Williams|
stated. “I like the small-town:
atmosphere, and I believe that,

there are many advantages toa
small college, particularly in
regards to athletics. For in-
stance, it is easy for a player to
counsel with his coach here,
whereas it is almost impossible
for an Alabama football player
to talk privately with Bear
Bryant.” Williams appears to
be satisfied with his niche at
Washington and Lee, and the
success of the defensive line,
especially this past season,
reflects his devotion to his job.

Generals Fall To E&H, Top Lynchburg

by Dale Park

It has been an unpredictable,
up and down season for head
coach Verne Canfield and the
Washington and Lee varsity
basketball team.

On February 4th, the
Generals dropped a 70-60 deci-
sion to ODAC rival Emory and
Henry on the Wasps’ home
court — the first time in seven-
teen years that W&L had lost to
E&H in basketball.

To make matters. worse,
W&L’s senior co-captain Carby
Hoy sustained an ankle injury
in the E&H game and will be out
for an indefinite period.

Hoy joins senior co-captain R.
J. Scaggs (lost earlier in the
season to a broken hand) and
junior guard George Spears
(who injured his shoulder
several weeks ago but who has
subsequently returned) in a
growing list of injured or ailing
Generals’ starters.

The consistent bright spot for
the Generals has been the play
of senior center Rob Smither-
man.

Smitherman alone generated
almosf half of the team’s scor-
ing in the E&H loss (he scored
24 points) and had about a third
of the team’s total rebounds (he
grabbed 15).

“Smitherman is playing the
best he has ever played, on both
ends of the court,” says Can-
field.

The only other W&L player in
double figures was freshman
forward John Graves. Graves,
who scored 11 points, has seen a
great deal of playing time as a
result of the injuries the team
has suffered. ’

On the night the Generals shot
a frigid 36 percent from the

floor.

Yet last Saturday night this
same W&L team hosted ODAC
rival Lynchburg College, a
team which defeated the
Generals earlier in the year,
87-79. Despite the fact W&L
played without Hoy and used a
wide assortment of make-shift
line-ups, the Generals got out to
a sixteen-point lead at one point
and held on for an exciting 80-75
victory.

But why the difference
between the Lynchburg and
E&H games? Further, why
have the Generals compiled an

- astonishing 13-2 record at home

while they have managed to win
only one game on the road while
losing four?

Although Canfield offered no
excuses, he did comment that
“one of our problems is our in-
consistency in getting ready for
a game and our respect for the
opponent we are playing. The
tougher the team, the better we
have played. Another problem
is that we don’t always play
together — too often everyone
tries to be a scorer and they
forget their roles.”

In the Lynchburg game
Smitherman again played his
“role” very well, scoring 22
points.and grabbing seven re-
bounds.

Spears and junior guard.

Clark New scored thirteen and
twelve points, respectively,
while sophomore forward Brian
Hanson added 15 points.

“The Lynchburg game was
pleasing,’ offered Canfield,
‘because we showed good ball
control and shot selection.”

As a result, W&L’s shooting
heated up to an impressive 64
percent from the floor.

The Generals now move into
the last part of their season.
Five games remain before the
ODAC Tournament; four away
games against ODAC rivals and
one home game against a non-
ODAC team.

In light of the Generals away-
game record, this last group of
games will be very critical.
While offering no particular
reason for their away game
troubles, Canfield did say that
“Teams just want to beat us so

   

Forward Br

rather beat us more than any
other team on their schedule,
and they’ll be waiting for us
when we travel down there

‘Seniors are always special
people to have around. These
five just happen to be nearly ir-
replaceable,” the Generals’

Rein and Lewis are “‘ex-
amples of how much a non-
player can do to support a pro-
gram,” according to Canfield.
‘People sometimes don’t
realize what Brad and Pokey
have done to help. They’ve
taken care of so many details
and done it willingly and
efficiently.”

Hoy, Smitherman, and
Scaggs started the season as the

center, are still in the line-up.

Wrestling Team Problems Explained

Sports Editor's Note: The
following article was written b y an
“insider” on the wrestling team.

A recent issue of the Ring-
tum Phi detailed the woes and
tribulations of the 1980-81
Generals wrestling team. The
team, so the article reported,
was suffering from seemingly
insurmountable malaise. Three
squad members had departed,
including co-captain and ODAC
champ Mike McFadden. In
addition, the morale of the team
was reportedly very low. The
time, experience and success
have wrought changes upon the
grapplers.

Two of the three departees
have returned to the squad.
McFadden is now functioning in
the role of instructor for the
team, assisting eight-year
coach Gary Franke. In addi-
tion, Elbert Umila has re-
turned, and is now quickly
becoming re-acquainted with
the demanding program. More
importantly, the team’s morale

and relationship with Coach
Franke has improved. At the
first of the year, it appeared
that the season was a potential
disaster. Moreover, some of the
newcomers had some trouble
adjusting to Franke’s coaching
style, as well as his expecta-
tions for each wrestler. Franke
is a perfectionist — a hard-
driving man who demands 100
percent effort every day in
practice as well as in the match
situation. He asks that each
wrestler work hard to achieve a
greater degree of wrestling ex-
pertise. This pressure, coupled
with academic demands, may
have caused some of the first-
year members to be less than
effective on the mat.

But this tense atmosphere has
lessened greatly since the first
of the year. The hard work
devoted each day in the
wrestling room has begun to
show on the wrestling mat.
Regarding wins, the team has
surpassed the mark of last

year’s squad. The defeatist at-
titude that haunted the team
earlier in the season has disap-
peared,

A positive outlook has pervad-
ed since the Glassboro State
match, in which the team was
humiliated by a vastly superior
foe. A strong speech was given
by team captain David Stoeffel,
who admitted to the team that
he was tired of losing, tired of
the bad attitude on the team.
After that speech, most team
members began to look at the
season in a different light. This
new attitude resulted in the
gradual improvement of the
team’s fortunes.

However, a_ drastic

turnaround has not resulted,
nor is it likely to, since, as
Franke believes, the team is
still not mentally prepared to do
battle effectively inside the
white circle. He is still op-
timistic, though. In Franke’s
opinion, mental preparedness,
or, aS he calls it, ‘mental

toughness,”’ is equally as im-
portant as_ physical and
technical fitness. He feels that
the team’s poor attitude has
been a major contributing fac-
tor in the teams unsuccessful
season.

In the final analysis, the team
has probably been both its own
worst enemy and _ strongest
Supporter. Feeding on each
other’s bad attitudes at the
beginning of the season, the
team suffered from an “I
Can’t” syndrome. Now, albeit
too late, the attitude has im-
proved, but Franke is still
pressing hard to maintain the
improvement. As skills and con-
fidence increase, mental
toughness will become an in-
tegral part of the team in the
years to come. With his crop of
new and talented young
wrestlers, the enthusiastic
Franke should be able to lead
them to more successful and en-.
joyable seasons. Moreover, the

wrestlers of the future should
also keep in mind the dark days,
,and the inspiration they have
received from team members
who will soon graduate. Their
example is a fine one to follow.

Track Team Runs Into

Trouble At VMI Relays

by Rick Swagler

It was not a pretty sight. As
coach Norris Aldridge put it, it
was the kind of meet you “‘don’t
like to talk about.’’ Saturday,
W&L ran in the VMI Relays.
Because most of the teams com-
peting were Division I or II,
W&L — quite frankly — got
swamped. None of the com-
peting team members placed in
the top five of any events.

Despite the team’s perfor-
mance, both Howard Herndon
and Alan Armitage set personal
records. Herndon’s_ record
came in the mile and
Armitage’s in the 55-meter high
hurdles. In other events, the
team of Paul Chapman, Chester
Townsend, Jon Kelefant, and
Herndon combined to run the
distance medley — a relay com-
posed of the half-mile, the
quarter-mile, the three-quarter

mile and the mile. The team of
Bob Jenevein, Bill Morris, and
the Kadesky twins ran what
Aldridge called a ‘‘good 440
relay.” The best event for the
team was the shuttle relay.
Here, the team of Armitage,
Parker Schenecker, Todd
Howe, and Russ Rector placed
sixth.

In individual events, Rector
competed in the high jump and
Kevin Kadesky competed in the
55-meter dash.

The meet was packed with
talent. Two runners from Rich-
mond ran in the prestigious
Milrose Games the night before
and a runner from Norfolk set
an unofficial world record in the
55-meter dash. Aldridge com-
mented that the record would
not be allowed because it was
hand-timed, but remarked ‘“‘he
was flying.”’

Aldridge said that the team
should be in ‘‘better shape’’ by
the Lynchburg Relays on the
2ist. Expected to compete at
Lynchburg are High Point
College, Bridgewater College,
Fairmont College, Francis
Marion, and W&L.

In regard to the ODAC cham-
pionship on the 28th, Aldridge
stated that Bridgewater will be
the team to beat due to strength
in the field events, and the same
will be true for outdoor season.
Of the championship, Aldridge
said, ‘‘We could place 2nd if we
run well. I’m not saying it’s im-
possible for us to get ist. In
athletics you never know.”

The Lynchburg Relays will be
held Saturday, the 2ist, with
field events beginning at 2:00
and running events beginning at
3:00.

Track Program Examined

by Alan S. Armitage

The indoor track season has
begun, and the W&L track team,
has gotten off to a respectable
start. Placing third in a 6-team
meet in Lynchburg two weeks
ago and participating in the
V.M.I. relays against Division I
schools this past weekend, the
team has demonstrated
promise.

Many people seem to have
gotten the wrong impression
about indoor track. Most of
W&L’s opponents began train-
ing before winter break, and
are prepared for indoor com-
petition as a season, not as a
warm-up for the outdoor
season. However, Washington
and Lee’s track team does not
participate in indoor track in
this manner. The indoor season
is comparable to spring train-
ing games in baseball or the

Soccer

Washington & Lee senior
Bryan Williams, a three-year
Generals’ soccer standout, will
attend a closed try-out practice
on Saturday and Sunday, Feb.

14-15, with the Charlotte
Lightnin’ of the American
Soccer League.

Williams, a resident of Rich-
mond, Va., will be one of 75
athletes at the session, which
will be directed by Charlotte
Lightnin’ head coach Rodney
Marsh.

‘This is the type of opportuni-
ty Bryan has been working
toward,’’ W&L head coach Rolf
Piranian. ‘‘He’s proved himself
as a capable leader and
talented player in college. He

pre-season in football; it is a
way for the team to settle into a
competitive stance and to
evaluate its fitness, cohesion,
and spirit.

Spirit is an important part of

any team and the track team is
certainly not lacking in this
area. Even when exhausted in
the middle of their own
workout, team members still
cheer a teammate in_ his
workout. The athletes supportt
each other in their individual]
events. Even though the team
works out separately as
sprinters, distance men, and
throwers, no factionalism of
separation exists.

Intensive running and weight
workouts have gotten the team
in shape while work on in-
dividual events has prepared
the team for its meets. Coach
Aldridge has used the school’s

deserves this try-out and should
make a good showing.”

Coaches Aldridge and Miriello
the experience of the veterans
and the potential of the rookies
will again be fused into another

team.

This year’s Washington and
Lee track team has quite a bit of
potential, both in its rookies and
in its veterans. With the realiza-
tion of this potential, the team
should achieve another winning
season and place well in the

Swimmers Are
Beaten Twice

by Phil Murray
The W&L swimming team
lost twice last Saturday to
Davidson, 72-39 and to Furman,
61-46, dropping the season meet
record to 3-6.

In terms of individual suc-
cess, however, the season is just
beginning for the Generals. As
Coach Page Remillard said,
“The most exciting part of our
season is yet to come.”’

The team has been gearing up
for the upcoming invitationals,
beginning in two weeks, and for
the NCAA Division III Cham-
pionships on March 19-21.

“Our goals have become
oriented towards the Nationals
and our training methods are
emphasizing that. One result is
tired swimmers,’ stated
Remillard.

workouts to get them in top

condition for the UNC-
Wilmington Invitational on Feb.
20. This weekend, the Generals
will face VCU, a tough Division
I school, and VMI in their final
dual meet of the season.

“‘We’re just looking for some
good individual times this week,
so that we can be rested and
healthy for the UNC Invita-
tional. We should be swimming
well in two weeks, and we’re
looking forward to some fast
times then,” Remillard opined.

While the meet record is not
as good as the team would like,
the individual performances
are up to Remillard’s expecta-
tions.

Six Generals have already
qualified to compete in the
NCAA Championships, and
Remillard expects three or four
more additions before long.
Mike Bernot has earned his
sport in the 50 and 100-yard
freestyle events, and freshman
Tim Rock will compete in the
1000 and 1650-yard free. The 400
free relay team of Bernot, Herb

Gresens, Eric Peterson, and

Gary Meyer has also qualified.

Scaggs Discovers New Side
After Suffering Injury

by Fred Mumford

At the exact mid-point of the
present Washington & Lee
University basketball season,
R. J. Scaggs suddenly found
himself in a new role with the
Generals.

Scaggs, a talented senior
from Roanoke, Va., opened the
season as a starting forward for

_W&L. Thirteen games into the
team’s 25-game regular-season
schedule, however, he broke his
right (shooting hand) wrist

during the second half of W&L’s -

82-79 double-overtime win
against Emory & Henry College
on January 15. As a result,
Scaggs has now become a scout,
recruiter, and assistant coach,
responsibilities which,
understandably, are a new ball
game to the two-year starter.

‘Recruiting and scouting are
a lot harder than playing,” the
personable Scaggs admits, ‘‘but
I think I can offer a prospective
player certain things which
Coach Canfield (W&L head
coach Verne) can’t. For exam-
ple, my first-hand experience
enables me to answer questions
pertaining to Coach Canfield’s
coaching and his philosophies.”

Scaggs’ immediate coaching
tasks under Canfield, W&L’s
17th-year director, center
around attention to freshman
John Graves and sophomore
Franke Eppes. Graves, a 6-5
forward from Norfolk, Va., and
Eppes, a 6-9 center from Green-
ville, S.C., are reserve players
this season but could, with
Scaggs’ help, develop into key
components of future W&L
squads.

A key component — such was

Scaggs’ playing role prior to the
injury. He averaged 10.1 points
and 4.6 rebounds in each of
those 13. outings, statistics
which were substantial im-
provements over his junior
season (6.9 points, 4.1 re-
bounds).

“R. J. was given more of a.
green light on offense and
defense this year,’ explains
Canfield, who has seen Scaggs
develop from a freshman junior
varsity performer into a consis-
tent varsity starter. ‘“‘He has the
ability to get the timely basket
or cause a turnover when the
team really needs a break.

‘‘He’s an intense competitor,

Generals.”’

When basketball ends in

Dean’s List honors many times
at W&L, will enter his fourth
season with the Generals out-
door track team, where he holds
the school record in. the 400-

Gee: Epitomy Of

by Ed Gonsalves

Do not tell Washington & Lee
University swimmer Jeff Gee
that college life is difficult. He
will not believe it.

Gee, a freshman backstroker
from Johnson City, Tennessee,
has indeed succeeded in both
the pool and in the classroom at
W&L. Yet talking with the
modest student-athlete, you

would never know this.
Gee explains his role on the

Generals’ team as “‘basically
one in which I try to do what I
can when I can. I try to plug the
holes when the team needs it.”’
His coach, second-year director
Page Remillard, is less modest
about Gee’s contributions.

‘He is the type of person who
makes a coach look good,
because he is always putting out
100 percent and then some. I
have confidence that he will
qualify for Nationals (the
NCAA Division III Champion-
ship meet on March 19-21) this
year and continue to improve
during his years at W&L.”’

Jeff’s work and dedication to
the swim program is probably
best seen in his transition from
a small, coarse swimming pro-
gram at Johnson City to
Remillard’s extensive pro-
gram, which includes almost
10,000 daily yards of swimming.

“It wasn’t too hard to adjust
to the extra swimming, but it
did take time,’’ offered the
blond-haired Gee, who jokes
that “‘the hardest part was get-
ting used to the pre-season
morning practice.”’

Gee had no problem adjusting
to the academic demands of
W&L, earning a perfect 4.0

Student-Athlete

 

  

grade point average in his first

term. Gee attributes his
academic success in part to the
honor code. ‘I chose W&L
because it has an honor system.
I knew that the academic en-
vironment would be challeng-

ing.’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Crime Report

Lexington’s annual police report contains some
good news along with alot of bad news. In his preface
to the annual report, Chief Kirby is quick to point out
there were no reported cases of murder or
manslaughter in the last year. Kirby said he was
pleased there were no violent crimes last year — yet
he admitted the fact that there was an attempted rape
— an act we certainly call a violent crime. And
anyone who has ever had the opportunity to get

jumped in Lexington can attest to the existence of '

violent crime in this small town.

We realize it would be ridiculous to think any town
— including little Lexington — could be totally free of
crime. At the same time we think it would be absurd
to say the police department is doing anything more
than a mediocre job. All year long we have observed
crime and tried to report on its consistently. Because
of certain laws, we can not cover most cases of
juvenile delinquency, but there are indications that
juvenile crime is also a problem here. The bottom line
is that Lexington really has fewer incidents of crime
than many cities; the crime statistics do not mean
much when crime strikes you or your friends. We
hope the police department can get its butt in gear,
spend some time working on ways to prevent pro-
blems, and maybe even hire someone who is
knowledgeable in crime prevention. Sure it is easy to
ride around in a quarter-ton tricycle writing tickets,
but it would be better to see some action toward clean-
ing this problem up.

Congratulations

After reading the crime report this week and before
packing to leave town, we thought we should remind
people to lock up for break. Take advantage of the
storage service, take your valuables home or leave
them with friends. It only takes a little time to lock up
and make sure you are protected for break — we urge
you to take the time and button up for the holiday.

Button Up

We would like to congratulate J. Hemby and Tripp
Brower for running a successful and well organized
Superdance. It is interesting to see a group take on a
project and show the type of responsibility necessary
to put on a marathon dance. While Rom Weatherman
makes a good point in his letter to the editor (he
thinks students should contribute to the local United
Way), we also support the Superdance and the im-
pressive job it has done in the last three years. There
are so many charities it is difficult to single one out
for special attention, but W&L seems to have found its
charity and should stick with one that is run so well.

Hall Criticizes Ariel Review

Dear Editor:

After reading the review of
Ariel in the February 5th issue
of The Ring-tum Phi, I feel com-
pelled to comment upon Mr.
Pyle’s criticism of the
“ magazine’s Fall edition.

Mr. Pyle suggests that the
Ariel staff engaged in a
deliberate effort to make the
magazine appear <“‘artsy.’”’ He
labels many of the works in
Ariel as merely feigned
attempts of circumlocution.
Ariel, he claims, is far too

' esoteric.

Yet, Mr. Pyle does not apply
the same standards he uses in
judging Ariel to his own review,
which is rather affected and
strained. The use of an expres-

sion such as “‘the legions of
literate lectors’’ seems quite
periphrastic to me. The review
itself commits the sins he
bewails.

I would agree with Mr. Pyle,
however, that much of the
material in Ariel is not of suffi-
cient merit to be included in, let
us say, Shenandoah or the
Sewanee Review. If the editors
applied the criteria of these pro-
fessional publications to our
student manuscripts, Ariel
would be a slim, if not non-
existent, volume. Few among
W&L’s current student writers
have won Pulitzer Prizes in
Poetry.

One must remember that
Ariel is a student publication,

and as such, must work within
the limitations of the material
submitted to the editors. When
examined with a_ sense of
perspective and with ap-
propriate expectations, the cur-
rent Ariel compares quite
favorably with not only past edi-
tions of Ariel, but also with the
student literary magazines of
other colleges.

Mr. Pyle could perhaps cor-
rect the malaise which he
perceives (if indeed one exists
at all) by encouraging the
growth of student writing at
Washington and Lee rather
than by condemning theAriel.

He’s already polished off one

He could herald a new dawn in

be more specific and accurate
in terming the early 1970’s as
the ‘relatively radical left

dying, except for the speaking

—they were hibernating. Many
of us were more concerned with
the posture of defying authority
than in doing so with the ‘in-

Superdance

For Local

United Way?

Dear Editor:

I know the Superdance is fun
and all of that — and all for a
worthy cause, too. Very com-
mendable. But doesn’t nearly
all of the money raised go off
somewhere?

I think Washington and Lee
students have an overriding
obligation of service to the com-
munity in which they study.
Why not stage a Superdance on
behalf of the local United Way,
which is now struggling every
year to meet its goal?

It would be a proper and
generous thing to do.

Rom Weatherman

the 20th century. Hunter
Thompson’s writings weren’t
stylish then, but made a lot
more sense on the gut level.

It is a fact that the SAB —
then the Dance Board Budget
couldn’t accommodate concerts
and a grand wazoo Fancy Dress
ball. The student tax was les.
than half of what it is now.

Many students preferred to.

spend their money on fun drugs.
A $20 per couple party of any
kind wouldn’t have gone over
any better than a lead balloon
unless the band had _ been
someone on the scale of Led
Zeppelin, and such bands’ going

rates for an evening were

higher than the total annual
budget for the Dance Board.
The Allman Brothers concert
was an extremely lucky fluke
and it was much better than any
Grateful Dead concert I’ve ever
heard. Those California boys
may have rhythm but they ain’t
got no soul.

As I recall, both ‘heads’ and

 

‘straights,’ and this place was
about 50-50 then, enjoyed the
hell out of that show. No one
bitched about there not being a
Fancy Dress because they
could still dress up for the frat
formal if that was their thing.

If there were gripers, they
“ast didn’t show, which was
easy enough; the alternative for
‘straights’ was to stay at the
frat house, tip a few more and
gator to the usual soul bands.
The lack of grain at pavilion
parties made no difference ex-
cept for fewer car wrecks and
fights. At the time, grass, LSD
and the like were enjoyed as a
more positively social alter-
native to alcohol in mass
quanitities.

All this bellyaching about the
SAB’s performance and integri-
ty lately seems rather nit-
picking to me. Having seen a
variety of well-meaning but
inept chairmen ‘(as well as a
few genuine lounge lizards)
over the past decade, the stu-

dent body should consider itself
fortunate to have the likes of
this year’s crew. Already they
have exceeded in both quality
and quantity. above anyone I
can remember. They may even
pull off an old pipedream of
mine: W&L’s first Jazz
Festival. Time will tell.

Last but not least, about Mr.
Pyle’s assessment of the Ariel.
As one who writes in the role of
a critic myself, I certainly
uphold the principle that critics
are entitled to their own
opinions. But over the years, I
have found that disdain is a
poor substitute for
knowledgeability in the field be-
ing reviewed and/or victimized.

All personal tastes aside, it
strikes _me as_ counter-
productive to criticize so
scathingly the only university-
sanctioned outlet students have
for the dying art form of
creative writing outside of the
classroom. (And the relation-
ship and priority scheme of

 

 

 

form vs. content within the
classroom is open to question in
too many cases).

So this is a thin year for stu-
dent writings. The Ariel people
haven't wasted any of their
space taking the Phi to pieces
for its many faults, though it
can be argued that Phi
coverage in too many instances
has given new meaning to the
idea that no news is good news.
So you might take that into
account and return the favor.

Without going so far as to sug-
gest that if you can’t say
anything nice, don’t say
anything at all, I will say that I
have learned to devote energy
and space only to good things I
wish to share with others. If
you’ve got ya-yas to get out, get
a punching bag. Ariel has had
the crap beaten out of it enough
already, though they do have a
way of coming up with more.

Reagan’s First Speech And Va.’s Beer Proposal

by Jed Dunn
Last week, President Reagan
addressed. the nation in his first

televised speech since taking

office. Immediately following
the speech, analysts on all three
major television networks
‘interpreted’ the President’s
message for their viewers. Con-
sider the implications of this.

To the average citizen, the
President represents respon-
sibility, authority, account-
ability and, by the virtue of
these attributes, can deliver his
message with its intended im-
pact. But due to the television
industry’s instantaneous
transmissions and _ quick-
thinking commentaries, an

editorial analysis immediately
assaults the viewer, denying
him the opportunity to assess
the impact of the speech
according to his own personal

criterion.

This power of the elec-
tronic/visual press. is_ indeed
awesome. By interpreting the
President’s remarks and
revealing selected insights
immediately following the
speech, the commentators can
manipulate and editorialize any
meaning the President might
have intended. While the
freedom and objectivity of the
press should be endorsed, it is
unfair to both the President and
the average citizen for
immediate analyses to be
made. Citizens should be given
the necessary time to make
reflective judgements of such
speeches unimpeded by any im-
mediate television editorial-
izing.

On Jan. 26, Virginia’s House
of Delegates passed a resolution
requiring an individual to be 18

years to purchase beer in
restaurants and at least 19 to
purchase beer in retail stores.

~The rationale~ behind..this..ab-_ .

surd proposal is to keep ‘‘beer
out of the high schools and off of
the road.”’ Certainly this is a no-
ble intention, but there are
some hard facts which need
consideration.

First, the now familiar argu-
ment that a voting-age citizen,
who is also eligible for the draft,
should not be arbitrarily denied
the privileges of citizenship,
e.g. the right to purchase beer.

Second, and perhaps more
importantly, the resolution is,
in effect, a government subsidy
for the restaurant industry. By
government decree, this pro-
posal entitles only restaurants
to meet the market demands of
18-year-old beer drinkers.
Retail stores are legally barred

from these sales and, therefore,
a substantial lessening of
competition may result. The

price to.consumers may go up

and the total revenue of retail
outfits may go down, both as a
result of government regula-
tion.

Finally, the aim to “‘get
drinkers off the road’’ is con-
tradicted by this proposal. 18-
year-olds who choose to con-
sume will be forced to drink in

restaurants, away from their
residences. What happens is
‘ that we find more drunks on the

highway trying to get home
from the restaurant because
they couldn’t buy beer to con-
sume at home.

What seems to be the solution
is undeniably worse than the in-
itial affliction. Hopefully, the
state legislature will see its
folly and opt this one to the’
trash bin.

by John Wells

Washington and Lee’s 74th
Fancy Dress Weekend will be
launched tonight at 8 p.m. with
a performance by
singer/songwriter John Prine
in Warner Gymnasium.

Since his first album was
released a decade ago, Prine
has built a strong and loyal
following without relying on the
exposure afforded most pop
stars by AM radio. He has
developed a_ distinct style

out as an_ acoustic guitar-
playing folk singer and reaping

 

throughout his career, starting:

  
   

NOTED singer/songwriter John Prine entertains in the Warner

critical acclaim as he moved
closer to folk rock and eventual-
ly rock and roll.

In 1978, Prine’s album
Bruised Orange was cited by
Time magazine as one of the
year’s ten best, and his songs
have been recorded by such ar-
tists as Joan Baez and Bette
Midler. Critics have compared
Prine at various times to Bob
Dylan, Woody Guthrie and
Hank Williams.

Prine is a fine performer, and
his lyrics contain humor and
pathos. He should get the
weekend off to a good start.

 

 

Secretary Confronted In

McCormick Parking Lot
While Gas Is Siphoned

by Tom Baker

A member of the Washington
and Lee University staff was
threatened and the cars of three
students were vandalized in
what appear to be two related
incidents over W&L’s recent
break.

At approximately 6:15 p.m.
on Monday, February 16, a
secretary left her office in Mc-
Cormick Hall and began walk-
ing from the front door to the

Opposite end of the parking lot

next. to the Commerce School
where her car, the only staff car

in the parking lot at the time,

was parked.

Although it was dark, the
secretary saw two individuals
who were in the process of
siphoning gasoline from the

tank of her car. Upon making,

her presence known, the
secretary claimed ‘the two in-
dividuals ran to their car, a
metallic brown hatchback
parked next to the staff
member’s car. With the car’s
headlights beaming in her face,
the secretary said the would-be
siphoners drove up on to the
curb in front of her in an ap-
parent and successful effort to
frighten her.

After the individuals had
driven off, the secretary called
the police who then inspected

the car with the exception of a
missing gas cap, the car ap-
peared to be undamaged.

The secretary, who asked not
to be named, believes that
because her car was the only
one in the parking lot at the
time, the two individuals
assumed that it was a student’s
car and proceeded to siphon gas
from her car.

The secretary expressed her
concern about the lighting in the
parking lot by stating that the
lighting ‘‘doesn’t seem _ ade-
quate anywhere on campus as
far as I'm concerned.”

While she admitted that in-
creased lighting might not have
been necessary in the past

Journalism Department To Hold

by Dave Dallam

On Fri., Mar. 6, and Sat.,
Mar. 7, the Journalism Depart-
ment of Washington & Lee
University will sponsor a panel
discussion entitled ‘‘The
Presidential News Conference:
Problems and Promises.”’

Participants include such
distinguished journalists as Bill
Moyers, former
Secretary to Lyndon B. Johnson
and currently a commentator
for PBS, who will serve as
moderator. Ron Nessen, former
Press Secretary to President
Gerald Ford, Sam Donaldson,
White House Corrrespondent
for ABC News and Bill Plante,
White House Correspondent for
CBS News, will also attend.

Also featured will be Ray
Scherer, former White House
correspondent for NBC News
and currently vice-president of
the RCA Corporation and Frank
Cormier, White House Cor-
respondent for the Associated
Press. Clark Mollenhoff, pro-
fessor of journalism at

Press _

Washington & Lee, will also at-
tend.

The purpose of the discussion,
according to Mollenhoff, is to
determine the history and pur-
pose of the Presidential press
conference as an_ institution.
The panelists will discuss its
achievements and failures, as

 

well as what improvements can
be made.

The medium of the White
house press conference is not
and has not been a perfect
method of conveying a balanced
picture of administration
policy. Mollenhoff, a veteran of
press conferences dating back

JOURNALISM professors Clark Mollenhoff and Ham Smith ‘‘get-
ting facts straight” for the presidential press conference panel.

  

to the Truman administration,
cites limited access of the press
to the President as a potential
problem of each imcoming ad-
ministration.

As administrations strive to
create viable new ideas for
orderly proceedings, they may
impose a decorum so stifling
that the President will be able
to control the questioning in
that he will call only on those
reporters who ask ‘‘softball’’
questions. ‘‘Softball’’ questions
are those which pose no real
danger to an administration.

Mollenhoff believes that this
problem can be avoided
through the creation of an en-
vironment in’ which
prevails, but also in which
reporters will be able to ask all
“relevant”? questions without
the threat of being censored.

The problems of access and
censorship are but two of many
aspects of the Presidential news
conference which will be
discussed by the panelists. The

On the previous Saturday,
three cars parked in the C lot
next to the practice football
fields were siphoned of gas and
two of the cars were vandalized.

One car had a_ window
smashed and a stereo and a bat-
tery ripped out. Unidentified in-
dividuals were in the process of
taking out the battery of the se-
cond car when University Proc-
tor Charles Murray chased
them off the parking lot. Mur-
ray Said he is currently in the
process of investigating all .
these incidents.

Seminar

sessions should give the public
an indication of what im-
provements should be made in
this medium.

Sessions will be held in Lee
Chapel at 3:30 p.m. and 8 p.m.
on Mar. 6 and at 10 a.m. on Mar.
7. The public is invited.

EC Confirms Whitebook Committee Trio

by W. Cope Moyers

The Executive Committee
received January financial
reports Monday night from two
university organizations, and
unanimously approved the con-
firmation of three members to
the White Book Revisions sub-
committee.

Pryse Elam, co-chairman of
the Student Activities Board,
reported that the estimated cost
of this year’s Fancy Dress is
about $36,000.00. However,
Elam warned that final figures

for this weekend’s big bash
could easily change since
original estimates were made
last month.

The SAB expects to spend
$8,700.00 for Thursday night
entertainment and $13,000.00 for
Friday night’s ball, according
to Elam. The largest expen-
ditures are’ for John Prine,
about $6,000.00, and the Peter
Duchin Bank that will play Fri-
day night. The SAB agreed to
pay the band $7,000.00. Close to
$9,000.00 is expected to be spent

for decorations, the board
estimates, with the largest cost
resulting from the actual
decoration of the Student
Center.

Elam said ‘“‘other’’ costs, 1n-
cluding security, beer and
publicity would come to about
$5,400.00. The SAB estimates

receipts for the ball at
$36,273.00, leaving the board
with a $183.00 profit.

Ariel also made its report to
the EC, reporting that it had
about $1,200.00 remaining of the

$2,000.00 originally allocated to
the student publication by the
committee for this year. The
deadline for students to submit
work for the spring issue is
March 24. The issue will be
distributed on May 22.

The Executive Committee
approved the confirmation of
senior Rob Brooke and third-
year law student Walter Kelley
to the subcommittee examining
possible revisions in the honor
system. Craig Cornett, assis-
tant director of publications and

a 1980 graduate of the universi-
ty, was also approved by the
committee.

EC member Jim Vines,
himself a member of the sub-
committee, reported that a
sophomore will probably fill the
only remaining vacancy on the
subcommittee. He said a choice
will be made soon.

Religion professor Louis
Hodges will also serve on the
subcommittee, Vines said,
which expects to make its
recommendation to the full EC
later this year.

Going Down The Road With Gas Going Up

by Bill Whalen

D.T.R. Headin’ down the
road.

It’s quite a simple proposition
when you consider it. All you
need is a car, three or four
friends, and enough gas to get
you there and back.

Finding enough willing part-
ners never seems to be a pro-
blem. You can usually find a
car if you look hard enough. The
only setback the average mink
might find in going down the
road is coming up with enough
money to pay for the gas.

Times were when the most
popular member of the fraterni-

 

ty house was the one with the
biggest car. Remember Animal
House and the infamous road
trip to Emily Dickinson Col-
lege? All the Delts needed were
enough beers to last the trip and
Flounder’s shiny new black
Continental.

But those times have come
and gone, and the budget-wise
road tripper of 1981 will find
himself making most of his
trips to Hollins or Sweet Briar
crammed in the back of a four-
cylindered import. The major
reason for this? Gas, of course.

Since 1973, gas has increased
almost 500 percent in the city of

HIGH GAS PRICES make filling up an unpleasant experience.

Lexington. Where the price of a
gallon of gasoline once was
25-30 cents, the current prices
are hovering near the $1.50
mark.

One victim of the spriraling
cost of gasoline is Johnnie
Lynn, the proprietor of the
Texaco station located at the in-
tersection of Main St. and Rte.
60. Lynn, who has been in the
service station business for 24
years, is now considering sell-
ing his station.

“Prices are closing us down,”
said Lynn. “I’ve lost money
over the last four years and I
can’t last much longer.”’

For Lynn, the major problem
is one of making enough gross
profit off the sale of each
gallon of gasoline. According to
Lynn, a small-time service sta-
tion owner must make at least a
10-percent gross profit on each
gallon to stay afloat.

Currently, Lynn makes only a
seven-percent gross profit off
the sale of each gallon of gas.
And compounded with the costs
of maintaining the station, Lynn
finds himslef running in the red.

“I buy my gas from a Texaco
direct dealer for $1.29.7 gallon
and sell it at $1.39,” said Lynn.
“That means I make about ten
cents on a gallon, but not ten
percent.”’

$1.39 represents the cost of a
gallon of Texaco regular gas.
Lynn’s unleaded stock runs as
high as $1.49 per gallon. When
considered into road trip ex-
penses, this has devastating
results.

If one were to drive the
Animal House Continental
from Lexington to Hollins and
back for a month, the cost

would drive most students to
the poor house, if not the Cold
Check Committee. If the Con-
tinental got 15 miles per gallon
on the highway, for example
and a round trip from Lexington
to Hollins is approximately 100
miles, then the average road
trip would cost almost $10. Four
or more road trips a month
would probably be more than
the average student could
handle.

Johnnie Lynn sees two ob-
jects which help W&L students
through this period, however.
One is the small car. The other
is the gasoline credit card.

“A majority of the students
who come in here have credit
cards,” said Lynn, ‘‘so I guess
Daddy pays and they don’t real-
ly care about the cost.’’ I’ve

also noticed some students have
cut down.”

Lynn considers Lexington’s
college students his ‘‘lifeline”’
during the winter months. Still,
he notes that not enough gas is
being bought to make a profit.

Lynn therefore sees only two
alternatives for himself. One is
to increase the volume of
available gasoline in hopes of
getting more revenue. The
other is selling out.

‘“‘There’s no real demand for
gas right now,’’ said Lynn, ‘‘so
my only choice is to sell.”

Unfortunately for consumers,
their only choice is to buy — and
buy at prices which never seem
to stop rising. This is the dilem-
ma of the road tripper. It is also
a problem which we may have
to live with for a long time.

Gloom. Darkness. The

gnashing of teeth. Yes, its that ;

time again: Santa Pinter is
back in town, spreading cheer
and merriment.

This year, Homer Bliss’
senior thesis production was
Happy Harry Pinter’s ‘‘The
Dumbwaiter.’’ Twice. In one
night. For three consecutive
evenings, yet. I cannot fault the
choice, the direction, or the pro-
duction; just for the record,
though, a rainy night without
dinner is bad enough without
{two hours of gloom. I just don’t
care for Pinter.

But if I did, I would have been
celebrating opening night. The
sets were just stark enough for
the tale: two semi-imbecilic:
British agents in a cellar during
WWII. The lighting was not so:
harsh as to gall the audience’
—all five of us, including the!
director and your oh-so-humble:
critic — but sufficiently bleak to:
remind us this is, after all,|
Pinter. I would suggest that the!

spots may have been too ob-
vious; but, opening night may

_well excuse that.

Dumbwaiter has _ beautiful ,
moments but awful quarter

hours (as Rossini said of
Wagner). Its pure Pinter
(more’s the pity): the

characters take their shoes on
and off and talk about death,
crockery, and toilets for half an
hour. Then one of ’em pulls a
gun (one step ahead of the
critic). It’s the sort of perfor-
mance you sit down to at six,
and when you look at your
watch three hours later, it’s six-
fifteen (Rossini again).

Last night was experimental
theatre, after all; you could tell,
because the seats were rickety.
The Boiler Room is intimate,

but so are coffins; why-is ex-

perimental theatre so often un-
comfortable theatre? Even the
program _was_ experimental.
(‘‘Washington and Lee...’ spell-
ing reform.in the Bernard Shaw
tradition). So, they presented
two different interpretations of
Dumbwaiter. Whimper.

The serious side was taken in
the first production, which
made the House of Usher look
like a Pavilion party. Lee Clark

as the irascible and_high-
handed Ben was quite
workmanlike, and George

larossi whined most admirably.
Perhaps if her were a trifle less
staid...The performance’s sole
difficulty of any magnitude was
a lack of that tension that might
have made the transformation
from ennui to frenzy easier for
all of us.

After the first production the
stage was readied for an at-
tempt at ‘‘Pinter with a lighter
touch.’’ The effect of this was to
dilute clinical depression to
mere suicidal melancholy. This
may have been ill-conceived as
an attempt but it worked
moderately well. The staging
was, unfortunately, rather con-
trived in the second production,
as Gus is shunted to stage right;
a position inconsistent with ef-
fective handling of stage direc-
tions. Still, Ted Petrides carried

The Sky Touch Ground Here Tomorrow

Riders In The Sky is one ex-
cellent band, one that cannot be
categorized. While based in
Nashville, Riders is not simply
‘‘country;’’ they represent that
music’s one-time other half —
“‘Western music.”’ -

Back in the 1940’s there was a
thriving musical genre that

drew on traditional cowboy
ballads and the lovely melodies
created by commercial
songwriters for Hollywood’s
singing cowboy stars. These
singing cowboys were
categorized by romantic
imagery of the West and its
scenery, and by harmony

 

singing and yodeling un-
matched to this day. Many of
these became so popular that
even the young people of today
are aware of them — ‘“Tumbl-
ing Tumbleweeds,’’ ‘‘Cool
Water,” ‘Happy Trails (To

- You), “Back In The Saddle

Again,” being good examples.

What Riders In The Sky has
done is brought back these
golden treasures, added some
hot instrumentals and original
tunes, and dressed the whole
thing up. with some fancy
western duds, sets, and skits.

The group guru is Doug
Green, a strappin’, big ol’
Midwestern. boy with all the
charm of Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid combined. ‘‘The
Big Fella,’ as he’s called on
Stage, has been a_ respected
Nashville musician for some
time, having appeared with the
Father of Bluegrass, Bill
Monroe, and sung gospel with
Emmylou Harris’ last touring
partners and back-up singers,
Buck White and the Down Home
Folks.

You've probably also seen his
byline as one of Nashville’s
freelance writers in most of the

major country music
magazines. A stint as the Oral

Historian of the Country Music
Foundation Hall of Fame re-

acquainted him with the joys of
western music. So he looked
around town for some like-
minded pickers.

Songwriter, singer, and bass
player extraordinaire Fred
LaBour joined first. Fred,
known as “Too Slim’’ in the
band, contributed the wit that
characterizes the group’s
make-believe radio show per-
formances. He’d known some
songwriting success, but once
with Doug, he gleefully began
pillaging the repertoires of
Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, The
Sons of the Pioneers, The
Riders of the Purple Sage, and
his other cowboy heroes of days
gone by.

But the trio was not complete
until the addition of Woody Paul
(Chrisman), whom they im-
mediately dubbed ‘‘The King of
the Cowboy Fiddlers.” This
superb musician has fiddled
with such luminaries as Wilma
Lee Cooper, Joe Sun, and rock
stars Loggins and Messina, yet
it seems he found his true niche
with Riders In The Sky.

Generals Lose Last Games,

Play In ODAC Tourney

by Dale Park
As a wrap—up to their 1980-81
regular season schedule, the
Washington and Lee varsity
basketball team dropped their
last three games ina row.

All three games were in the
ODAC, and all three games
were on the road. As a result,
the Generals ended up with a 2-7
away game record for the
regular season and will enter
the the upcoming ODAC Cham-
pionship Tournament with a 7-7
league record. The ODAC Tour-
nament will be held in Salem,
Virginia, February 26-28.

On Saturday, February 14,
the Generals travelled to
Roanoke to take on the national-
ly ranked Maroons. Earlier in

the season, W&L had dealt
Roanoke their only loss of the
season in a 96-79 rout in Warner
Center.

Although the Generals
scrambled to a 29-27 halftime
lead, the Maroons full-court
pressure broke the back of
W&L’s backcourt, forcing 27
turnovers, as Roanoke powered
its way to a 75-64 win.

‘We didn’t work against the
press as effectively as we did in
the first game,’’ remarked head
coach Verne Canfield. ‘‘I have
no idea why we. didn’t.
Sometimes our team lacks men-
tal toughness when it is backed
into a corner.”’

with 14 points, while classmate
Rob Smitherman, at center,
contributed 12 points. Junior
forward Clark New chipped in
11, and sophomore forward
Brian Hanson added 10 points
and grabbed 11 rebounds.

Tuesday, February 17, found
the Generals facing the Eastern
Mennonite Royals, one of only
two teams to hand W&L a loss
at home all season. Mennonite
was able to do the same on its
own court, with a 90-81 victory
over the Generals. Smitherman
paced his team with 20 points
and fourteen rebounds. In the
game, Smitherman topped the
1,000 point mark for his career.
Only ten other players in the
history of W&L basketball have
ever achieved this goal.

“Rob (Smitherman) has
worked the hardest to achieve
the 1,000 point goal and is one of
the most deserving to attain it.”
commented Canfield.

Following Smitherman were
Hanson and New, who scored 12
points apiece, and junior guard
George Spears, who added 11
points.

The Mennonite loss marked
the second time in two years
that the Royals have defeated
W&L in both regular season
games.

The Generals topped off their
away-game frustrations on Fri-
day, February 20, in a 78-67
final game loss to the Maryville
Scots. W&L’s shooting percen-
tage from the floor, erratic all
season, dropped to 43 percent
for the night.

Freshman forward, John
Graves, ina starting role for the
sixth time this season, lead his
team with 16 points. Graves had
been instrumental in W&L’s
final home game of the season,

12.

At home, the Generals fin-
ished with a 14-2 mark; overall,
W&L compiled a 16-9 record.

Canfield maintained that his
team should not have lost as
many games as it did, espec-
ially in the ODAC. Offered Can-
field, ‘‘I am disappointed in this
team. Our problem is not a mat-
ter of execution, it is a matter of
mental preparation and adjust-
ment for a particular game.”’

In last year’s ODAC Tourna-
ment, W&L entered with a 5-5
league record and a_ fourth
place seed (out of six teams),
and by virtue of three im-
pressive victories, won the tour-
nament.

This year the Generals will
face an expanded tournament
schedule in their bid to repeat
last year’s performance
(Roanoke and Maryville are
now eligible to compete for the
ODAC title).

More teams may be the least
of the Generals’ worries. Can-
field conceded that ‘‘last year,
we had pride and a season filled
with emotion. This season
we've had nothing like that —
nothing to bind us together. Our
players are not able to react to
every game situation, whether
it is a bad call, etc. If I knew
what the key was to bring the
team together, I would use it,
but as of right now, I don’t.”

Crawford Breaks Records To

Qualify For Championships

by Philip Murray

Rob Crawford set three
school records at the UNC-
Wilmington Invitational last
weekend, as a number of
outstanding individual _ per-
formances were turned in by
the W&L swimmers.

The junior transfer from Ft.

Crawford’s time of 1:00.95 in
the 100 yard breaststroke event,
broke the oldest record in the
W&L books, set in 1962 by Elliot
Maynard, at 1:04.40. That time
was also good enough for
Crawford to place first in that
event in the overall competi-
tion.

In the 200 yard breast,
Crawford finished fourth, but
set a new school record in the

preliminaries at 2:15.95. The old

record stood at .2:19.50.

Finally Crawford smashed
his own record in the 200-yard
individual medley by nearly

at 3:43.117, breaking the 1979
mark of 3:44.20.

Another noteworthy _ per-
formance came from freshman
Jeff Gee. In addition to his con-
tribution on the relay team, Gee
posted personal best times in
the 200-yard backstroke and the
100-yard butterfly events.

Coach Remillard was _ ob-
viously pleased with the perfor-
mance of the team. A lack of
depth on the team forced the
coach to gear his training
toward the invitationals and in-
dividual efforts rather than
team competition. This tactic is
certainly paying off well for the
Generals now.

Seniors Mike Bernot and
Herb Gresens will take part in
the Virginia Senior Champion-

ing weekend for its final swim

Jones Takes
Positive View

by Todd Barstow

If this year’s baseball
Generals play as well as new
head Coach Craig Jones
believes they will, the
Washington & Lee 9 could be
headed for a very successful
spring. Jones, who was picked
unexpectedly by Athletic Direc-
tor William McHenry to head
the program, is a very positive
young man who appears to en-
joy his new position. His selec-
tion, he said, came as
something of a surprise to him
— he had expected to be only an
assistant to former head coach
Chuck Kroll.

The new skipper is happy for
two reasons: the atmosphere at
the school and the talent that he
sees on this year’s squad.

Jones feels that the ball

. players are more enthusiastic

since none of them are on
athletic scholarships. While he
sees nothing wrong. with
athletic scholarships, he does
believe that they are the ‘‘bot-
tom line.’’ He comments: ‘An
amateur is someone who plays
for the love of the sport.”

It will take more than en-
thusiasm to win baseball games
this spring, however, and Jones
is also excited about the talent
he sees developing, especially
with the numerous newcomers
to the dugout.

Defense will be stressed this
season. The outfield is especial-
ly strong and junior co-captain
and All-American center fielder
Thad Ellis comments: ‘‘this is
the first year we've had a solid
(defensive) outfield.’ Starting
will be Jody Harris in left, Ellis
in center, and junior transfer
Don Dudley in right.

Dudley is a former Lexington

High standout who, according
to local observors, has a
tremendous throwing arm.

The infield is also solid, with
sophomore Chris Cavalline at
short, freshman Kevin Golden
at -second,: and <untor
Jeff Haggerty at third. First
base is still open.

Right hander Dave Randall
and portsider Marty Thomas
are expected to anchor the
pitching staff.

Jones is firmly convinced that
pitching is essential for the suc-
cess of the team. The coach is
looking for consistent pitchers
who will get men out regularly.
Jones says that college ball is
demanding on pitchers, who
often have little time to prepare
themselves for the season.
Jones has been impressed by
the many new arms on the
squad, however.

Overall, Jones is impressed
by the hard work and the self-
discipline of the players. He
plans to use the individual
talents of each player as possi-
ble in the years’ games. The
starting lineup is not absolute.
Jones will play those who are
producing at the plate as well as
in the field.

Jones anticipates a successful
season if the pitching and hit-
ting develop as he hopes they
will. One problem in recent
years, offers Ellis, has been the
team’s attitude after the Easte -
break. Pitchers often lose their
timing; hitters have the same
problem. The team’s winning
attitude is often lost during the
pressure of exam week.

All in all, the 1981 diamond
stars are looking forward with
eagerness to a_ successful
season.

Track Team Slowed

In Lynchburg

by Rick Swagler
The W&L indoor track team

 

finished fifth at the Lynchburg
Relays on Saturday the 2ist.
This accomplishment was
somehow dimmed, though, by

| the fact that only five teams

participated. Coach Norris
Aldridge first said that he ‘‘was
a little disappointed’’ but upon
further consideration, he com-
mented that he ‘‘wasn’t disap-
pointed” with the individual
performances but the guys
‘didn’t perform well as a
team.”

Individually for the Generals,
Bob Jenevein, Rob Brod, Billy
Morris, and Kevin Kadesky ran
the 440 relay and collected the
third place ribbon. The mile
relay team of Paul Champman,
Morris, Kadesky and Russ Rec-
tor ran for a fourth place finish.
Aldridge also praised Howard
Herndon and John Kelefant for
their performances in the
distance medley.

One interesting aspect of
W&L indoor track is the number
of events each athlete par-
ticipates in. Russ Rector, for
example, an _ aspiring
decathlete, ran in the 880 relay,
the sprint medley relay, the
mile relay, and would have run
in the shuttle relay had the
team not been disqualified for a
false start. In addition, Rector
participated in the long jump,
triple jump, high jump, and
Shot put. In fact, the only field
event he didn't participate in
was the pole vault. simularty,
Billy Morris ran the 440 relay,
mile relay, 880 relay, and sprint
medley relay.

In regard to the ODAC Cham-
pionship to be held Saturday at
Lynchburg, Aldridge com-
mented that the team ‘thas a
tendency to come back.”
Bridgewater College is favored
to win, with W&L and Lynch-
burg expected to fight it out for
second,

Wrestlers End Up-And-Down Season

With Two Consecutive Defeats

by John Harrison

The W&L wrestling team end-
ed an up and down season with
consecutive defeats at David-
son and Catawba. The scores
from both meets were 36-13,
dropping the Generals’ final
duel meet record to 4-8.

As was the case during most
of the season, senior captain
Dave Stoeffel and freshmen
Tim Valliere and Carlton
Peebles turned in strong perfor-
mances. Peebles pinned his
Davidson opponent and had an
impressive 11-3 win at Catawba.
Vailiere and Stoeffel posted 7-0
and 16-5 victories, respectively,
at Davidson. Freshman
Richard Kopelman also came

un with a win. 16-13, at
captain Stoeffel and coach Gary

Franke. Stoeffel reshaped the
team’s defeatist attitude with a
strong speech he gave after the
Generals got off toa 1-4 start. At
the same time, coach Franke,
realizing he was working with
an inexperienced and usually
undermanned team, persistent-
ly made an effort to raise
morale and make everyone
prepared for each meet.

The team already appears to
have a strong nucleus with
which it can make an even bet-
ter improvement next season.

ood mat sense and quickness,
it is possible that '81-'82 will be a
winning season.

In spite of its problems on as
well as off the mat, the
Generals made a slight im-
provement on last season’s 3-8
record. The credit should go to
Catawba. The final week of ac-
tion raised Valliere’s record,
from both duel meets and tour-
naments, to 13-11, the best on

the team. Stoeffel was second at
13-15, followed by Peebles at
9-13.

went on to represent W&L in the

Tournament held last Saturday
at Salisbury State (Md.).

Peebles fourth in their classes.

11 Lax Players
To Miss Game

by Rick Swagler

As a result of curfew viola-
tions which occured during the
lacrosse team’s week of train-
ing in Florida, eleven players,
many of whom are starters, will
probably not participate in
Saturday's scrimmage game
against the Virginia Beach
Lacrosse Club.

In an effort to ensure devotion
to the week of practice, Coach
Jack Emmer imposed a 12:00
curfew. However, eleven
players violated curfew on one
night, according to reliable

sources. Most of those in viola-

were All-Americans.

| Teams Enjoy
Florida Trips

by Rick Swagler

During the Washington Holi-
day, both the baseball and
lacrosse teams went to Florida
as part of their training for the
spring sports season. Although
Coaches Jack Emmer and
Craig Jones said that Florida
boasted of good weather and
superior field conditions, they
cited somewhat different objec-
tives for the trips.

Jones remarked that, ‘‘The
guys had been pent-up in the
gym, and we just wanted to
chew some tobacco and get in
the mood for baseball.’’ Jones
said a prime reason for the trip
was to evaluate his team in ‘‘an
outdoor situation.’’ Sophomore
outfielder Jody Harris stated,
“In Florida, we had the oppor-
tunity to play some excellent
ballclubs.’’ The three teams the
Generals faced, Rollins College
(whom W&L opposed three
times), Florida Central Univer-
sity, and Florida Institute of
Technology, are all nationally
ranked in Division II.

According to Harris, the
team’s strength lies in the solid
core of veterans who anchor
this relatively young team (half
of the players are rookies), but
admits that the primary
weakness lies in the pitching
staff. ‘At this point, we have a
definite weakness in the pit-
ching department,’’ states Har-

ris. “With Rich Hachenburg
and Marty Thomas the only
veteran moundsmen, our inex-
perience is certainly a factor at
this point.”’

Coach Jones was so en-
thusiastic about shortstop Chris
Cavalline’s hitting that he was
switched from leadoff in the
batting order to fourth, a slot
normally reserved for a team’s
power hitter, and said, “If he
keeps hitting the ball, he'll stay
there."’ Jones also coted noted
that freshman Dave War-
renfeltz was impressive at third
base and relief pitcher. The
freshman’s performance at the
‘*Hot Corner,’ has been profi-
cient enough to force the
removal of incumbent third
sacker Jeff Haggerty to first
base, at least for the time being.

Although a curfew did exist, it
was not strictly enforced.

Lacrosse coach Jack Emmer
said that his team improved its
offensive and defensive
systems while in Florida. Em-
mer noted that he would have
liked to spend another week in
Florida. Despite the obvious
benefits of weather and field
conditions, Emmer wanted to
bring his charges to Florida so
that they could focus all their
attention on preparing for the
season, slated to start on March
7.

UC Discusses Chance Of

Intellectual Convocation

by John Wells

Washington & Lee's Universi-
ty Council yesterday passed a
motion to appoint a committee
to investigate the possibility of
a quadrennial student-run
‘intellectual convocation”
similar to the mock convention.

The motion followed a discus-
sion on a proposal by faculty
members William L. Sessions
and Thomas A. Williams, who
head a subcommittee on liberal
education. In an outline of the
proposal, Williams suggested a
combined — student-faculty-ad
ministration effort to create a
symposium dealing with ‘any
number of academic
disciplines’ in a time frame
and structure similar to that of
the mock convention.

Williams said the convocation
would feature opposing planks
on a topic of local or national
importance, with appropriate
guest speakers to be invited.
The symposium would produce
a white paper on the subject.
Williams mentioned world
hunger and the energy shortage
as two possible topics.

Sessions drew parallels be-
tween the proposal and the
mock convention and similar
events conducted annually at
the nation’s’ military
academies.

The proposal’s intent was met
with generally favorable re-
action by the council, although

there are some members who
doubted the sucess of such an

OTe ealty member Milton Col-
vin said that student participa-
tion in the convocation would be
critical to its success. Colvin
then said he seriously questions
the amount of student interest
in such a project during the
spring term.

 

“If there’s a grain party at
Zollman’s Pavilion the same
day, you might carry it off,”
Colvin said. ** But I'll bet the
ranch in Texas you won't.”

Albert C. Gordon, another
faculty member, pointed out
that the mock convention runs
concurrent with the US.
presidential election, a matter
of national attention. Inter-
fraternity Council President
Monte Briscoe said that the con-
vention was also unique in its
blend of social and political
motivation.

Discussion leaned in favor of
a meticulously planned con-
vocation to be held early in the
spring term to insure female
participation from the local
woman's colleges. It was
agreed that such an _ event
should be held every four years
to alternate with the mock con-
vention.

Faculty member Louis
Hodges said that while he
agreed with some of the ex-
pressed reservations, he was in
favor of looking into the matter.
Hodges moved to appoint an ex-
ploratory committee, and the
motion was passed unanimous-
ly.

The committee will be
selected by council co-chairmen
Lewis G. John and Joe Robles.
It will look into the feasibility
and desirability of holding a
convocation and report back to
the council at its April 29
meeting.

At the suggestion of Ex-
ecutive Committee President
Bob Willis, the next meeting .of
the council will deal with what
Willis described as ‘‘the con-
tinuing seperation of the law
and undergraduate campuses
at all levels of the university.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

While At The Ball

Once again the highlight of the W&L social season
is upon us. Across the campus rooms are cleaned, hot
tubs are hooked up, and final arrangements are made
for the university’s biggest blast. By now most of us
have purchased tickets for the Fancy Dress Ball and
had an opportunity to purchase souvenirs galore —
and these are the only souvenirs you should end up
with at the weekend’s finale.

We think that the decorations in the student center
should still be there after the night is over. Anyone
who has been around the student center this week has
seen the Student Activities Board work tediously set-
ting up for the event. These guys have really put out
the maximum effort to show the university a good or
amazing time. The budget is running a bit high this
year and it will help the board if we all purchase our
souvenirs, instead of stealing them. It would be
dishonest and highly inconsiderate to do so.

The Big 3

In a few weeks we will all have an opportunity to
vote for the ‘“‘big three’’ on our student body. The
president, vice president and secretary are important
posts in matters of administration and honor. It is im-
portant that qualified people hold these posts. We
urge anyone interested to go for the job and let your
credentials be known.

Congratulations, Mr. Johnson

Dear Editor:

Congratulations on_ the
wonderful honor recently be-
stowed upon you, Mr. Johnson,
by the Rhodes Committee. |
read it all in the Ring-tum Phi.

After reading the article, I
felt compelled to write. Overall,
Mr. Johnson, I must tell you
that when you _ leave
Washington & Lee to travel

across the ‘‘great water’ to Ox-
ford, you will not be leaving
your troubles behind you. No,
Mr. Johnson. They will go with
you because your troubles, in
good measure, are within you.

How did I come to that conclu-
sion? Let us analyze what you
stated in the Ring-tum Phi.

Early in the article we learn
that you will earn two degrees,
one in physics, one in
mathematics. Yet you state
that you chose W&L seeking a
liberal arts education but doubt
you received that. I doubt it,
too. Methinks that you did not
apply yourself in English,
Biology or Psychology, etc.

‘Your preoccupation with
‘research and_ research
facilities’’ probably
kept you from it. ‘Violently op-
posed to research?” Do you
really meah that, Mr. Johnson?
I give you an F in English Com-

position. By the way, while we
are on the subject of research,
just what percentage of the
population of any liberal arts in-
stitution is interested in doing

research as you are? Have you
taken an official query of your
fellow students to discover how
they feel? How can you feel that
it would be ‘‘money well spent”’

to put in the type of research
facilities you want when few
students desire to use them! F
in Economics.

I’m so glad you went through
rush open-minded. For that
statement you receive an F in
English Grammar. It should be
open-mindedly. By the way, did
any of the fraternities ask you
to pledge? And your statement

“only friends you make in
fraternities are social ones’’
leads me to believe you know
little about human nature. Your
unofficial grade in Psychology,
therefore is an F. (Did you
bother to take any Psychology,

Mr. Johnson?) Point of fact: all
friendships are ‘‘social ones’’ at
first. They must have time to
develop into more.

Now to the juicy stuff. Your

statement “W&L is’ the best
school I know of to get laid.”

How is that possible at an all
male institution? Did I

misunderstand your meaning,
Mr. Johnson? F in English
Sematics.

So you find it difficult to talk
to a woman professionally
without dancing with her first.
That is definitely your problem,

Mr. Johnson. One which I feel
you may be able to overcome as
you work on it. Give ita try.

And lastly, Mr. Johnson,
please tell me why you stayed
on at W&L for four long years?
How long did it take a bright

young fellow like yourself to
discover that W&L was all
wrong and you were all right?

I find you self-centered and a
bore, and I only read about you
yesterday. If you thought you
could “‘find few people at W&L
to talk to,” think how your dates
- the past four years must have
elt.

Nevertheless, I wish you luck
and good fortune. I hope you
find what you are looking for.
You will have to do some

Serious growing up first; and as
you are now in your twenty-
second year, it’s about time.

U.Va. Psychologist Claims Preppies
Subject To Anxiety, Depression

At a time when ‘“‘the prep
look”’ is advertised widely on
television and the sale of pink
and green is doing better than
ever, a psychologist at the
University of Virginia has
theorized that the current dress
fad may result in anxiety,
stereotyped roles and even
mental depression.

Dr. Thomas Gates, director of
UVa.’s University Counseling
Service, claims that being a
‘‘preppie”’ places an unnatural
strain on the roles of men and
women and is unfair to certain
socio-economic groups. Gates
also believes that the new wave
of prep fashions on college
fashions serves as a replace-
ment to the Army jackets and
long hair of the late 1960’s and
early 1970's.

“To be a really good preppie
forces stereotype roles for men
and women, which is something
society has been trying to
diminish,” said Gates. Gates
also claims that being a prep
is more exclusionary than inclu-
sionary, meaning it is more of
an elitist’s undertaking.

According to Gates, people
who wear clothes splashed with
generous amounts of stripes,
checks or flourescent colors are
“seeking a sense of who they
are through external factors,
which is about the most anti-
mental thing you can do.”

Gates said that his service

has experienced a number of
women who spend as much as
two hours getting ‘prepped
up,” only to wind up wearing
matching clothes.

Gates believes that the cur-
rent preppy fad is more difficult
for a psychologist to handle
than marijuana users of the
1960’s. ‘“‘The kids at that time
would confront you openly,”’
said Gates, ‘‘whereas these kids
will snub you quietly and polite-
ly.”

But preppies are now getting
into drugs, believes Gates.
While alcohol was once the only
drug used among the khaki
corps, Gates believes that co-
caine has now become the new
status symbol.

Gates said that among prep-
pies, a golden cocaine straw is a
sign of prestige.

Cocaine is a hit among prep-
pies, Gates believes, because of
its high cost and the resulting
high. Gates said that among
drug-using preppies, the ‘‘in’”’
thing to do is to snort some coke
and then go out for a spin in
their BMW. Gates said he has
seen this occur especially with
preps in their 30’s.

Gates believes that the
University of Virginia allows a
psychologist the opportunity to
see preps and non-preps of all
ages. With an enrollment of
over 16,000, UVa. offers a wide
assortment of graduates and

  

on:

undergraduates from both af-
fluent and non-affluent classes.

Where being prep once was
limited to a small minority of
the school, Gates said the fad
has spread through the campus.
Gates claims he has _ seen
loafers, button-down shirts and
Khaki-pants being worn more
this year than ever before.

Gates also believes that there
is a price to be paid for joining a
fad. “If they think getting
dressed that way is all of a sud-

den going to make them more

popular, they’re crazy,”’ said
the psychologist. ‘‘For the kid
who already feels bad about
himself if this doesn’t work for
him, it might be a confirma-
tion that he isn’t worth
anything.”’

Therefore, Gates is simply
warning all would-be preppies
that being accepted into this fad
may be an invitation toa unique
form of depression — a depres-
sion that is the result of being a
conformist rather than an in-
dividualist, according to Gates.

To avoid falling into the prep
syndrome, Gates says that the
individual should avoid being
taken in by handbooks and
other articles which glamorize
or romanticize the life of prep-
pies — a name derived from the
desire to imitate the products of
those exclusive preparatory
schools.

Girl Enters Infirmary
After Eating Mushroom

by Bill Whalen
The girl came into the infir-

mary on Friday afternoon. To
be more precise,
brought in.

she was

To be exact, she was carried
in.

Doesn’t sound too com-
plicated, does it? A girl being
carried around on the Friday
afternoon of Fancy Dress
weekend. Too much grain,
right?

Wrong. The girl had eaten a
“magic mushroom”’ or simply
“shroom”’ and was now having
a “‘bad trip.”

This is not a hypothetical
case, the exact scenario oc-
curred Friday afternoon at the
WAL infirmary. And the condi-
tion of the girl, complicated
with the schoul’s policy on
treating students’ dates, placed
the attending physician, Dr.
James Busch, in a predica-

‘ment.

“Normally, we don’t treat

~ dates,” said Busch, ‘“‘but seeing

as she was carried in, I had no
real choice.’’ Busch said he then
proceeded to treat the girl, who
said she was a student at
Georgetown University.
‘“‘When she was brought in,
she was unable to walk and said
she felt lightheaded,” said the

EC Extends Big 3 Deadline

by W. Cope Moyers

A typographical error in the
official minutes of two Ex-
ecutive Committee meetings
resulted Monday night in a one
day extension of the deadline
for candidate petitions for the
Big Three elections.

The error, made in both the
February 9 and 23 EC minutes,
says that petitions for presi-
dent, vice-president and
secretary are due March 3
(Tuesday) instead of March 2.

The extension gave students
who -did not file petitions by
Monday an additional 24 hours
to turn in the required 150
signatures to the committee.

Article XI of the student body
constitution requires that
signatures for the Big Three be
handed to the EC by the ninth
Monday after January 1, a pro-
vision President Bob Willis

stressed during the commit- .

tee’s discussion about how to
resolve the problem.

Willis said he was uncertain
whether the committee could
legally extend the deadline
since ‘‘the constitution is ex-
plicit.” He added that a two-
thirds vote of the committee
would be required before agree-
ing to extend the deadline one
day.

But after a lengthy discus-
sion, the EC voted to
automatically extend the
deadline with Willis the lone
dissenting committee member.

“Through our mistake there
is a chance we won't give so-
meone the chance to run,”’ Vice-
President Willie Mackie said.

Two EC members are among
the five candidates running for

Big Three positions, with junior
Eric Myers the only student
running for president.

EC secretary Bud White is
running against junior Blake
Witherington for vice-president
of the student body and two
sophomores, Dennis Roberts
and Bennett Ross, are can-
didates for secretary.

In a related matter, the com-
mittee rejected member Pete
Baumgaertner’s suggestion to
limit at 15 the number of posters
each candidate is allowed to
place around campus, instead
increasing the number to 20.

The committee did agree with
Baumgaertner however, that
candidates be allowed to spend
a maximum of $10, use only one
banner and limit poster size to
84 x 1l inches.

Senior member Marshall
Clark suggested that can-
didates be_permitted to spend
any amount of money they wish
and that no limit be imposed.

“If you place a limit on
money, I think you’re limiting
free discussion,” said Clark.

The Executive Committee
also set March 30 as the

doctor. ‘‘She looked like she was
about to keel over and she had
strange respirations.”’

Busch said he then took the
girl into a nearby room and told
her to lie down. Because she
was’ hyperventilating, accor-
ding to the doctor, the patient
was “‘bagged’’ until she began
to breathe normally.

Busch claimed that he was
not aware of whom the girl’s
date was, saying that he had
‘‘seen his face’’ on several occa-
sions. The doctor likewise did
not know the full name of his pa-
tient, saying she gave him only
her first name.

After lying down for approx-
imately two hours, the girl left
the infirmary.

 

Under other circumstances,
an incident of this sort might go
unnoticed. But this was. the first
time Busch has treated a W&L
student or his date for this pro-
blem. And, according to Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly
C. “John” Read, it is the first
time a “magic mushroom” inci-
dent has come to his attention.

But what does a mushroom do
to a person to cause this
change?

According to Dr. Busch,
“magic mushrooms,”’ which
fall under the’ term

“‘psilocybin’”’ in medical ter-
minology, are ‘‘similar or com-
parable to’’ the drug L.S.D.
Busch claims that ‘magic

Bouton To Speak Mar.12

Jim Bouton, the former ma-
jor league pitcher whose ir-
reverent inside look at profes-
sional baseball, “Ball Four,”’
became a bestseller, will speak
in Lee Chapel on _ the
Washington and Lee University
campus Thursday, March 12, at
8 p.m.

Bouton’s appearance at W&L
is sponsored by ‘‘Contact,”’ the
symposium organized jointly by
the Interfraternity Council and
the W&L Student Government.

A member of the American
League All-Star team in 1963
when he played for the New
York Yankees, Bouton has gain-
ed notoriety as an author, a
sportscaster and, most recent-
ly, a bubble gum entrepreneur.

Bouton pitched for the
Yankees from 1962 through
1967. He later played for both
the Seattle Pilots (1969) and
Houston Astros (1969-70) before
retiring from _ baseball to
become a_ sportscaster for
WABC-TV in New York.

In 1970, Bouton wrote ‘‘Ball
Four,’’ which sent shockwaves
through the baseball world
because of his candor.

From 1971 to 1977, Bouton
wrote a sequel to ‘Ball Four”
entitled “I’m Glad You Didn’t
Take It Personally” while also
becoming a delegate to the
Democratic national conven-
tion and creating and starring
in a television situation comedy
based on his first book.

In 1978, Bouton, then 39 years
old, came out of retirement.
working his way up through the
minor league organization of
the Atlanta Braves and even-
tually pitching several games
for the major league team.

It was during his return to
baseball that Bouton came up
with the idea of ‘Big League
Chew,” a bubblegum marketed
nationally by the Wrigley com-
pany.

Bouton’s appearance at W&L
is open to the public.

EXECUTIVE Committee members, (left to right) Jim Vines,
Willie Mackie, Bob Willis and Bud White vote on elections rules
during Monday’s meeting.

Candidates
The social committee spent

$537 in December, $450 int
January and almost $2,000 in’
February.

Both Willis and Edwards ask-
ed Xing how so much money
could be spent and why so little
of the allocated monies re-
mains. Edwards said he and
many other law students were
unhappy with the manner in
which the committee was
operating and Willis said he was
angry that SBA parties were not
publicized among the
undergraduate school.

‘We are trying to find ways to
unite the campuses
(undergraduate and law
schools) and this doesn’t help us
do that,”’ Willis said.

Xing said most law parties

people that can attend because

For the third time this year,
the Executive Committee will
attempt to get enough students
to vote on a proposed amend-

Prometheus
Raising The Ole G.P.A.

Now that Fancy Dress is but a hangover in our wellhung imagina-
tions, it has come to my attention that the students are actually get-
ting back to work. Horrors! But this is, indeed, the last month of
school ; Spring term is almost here. Furthermore it has come to my
attention that many of you will not, will never make it to the glories
that are, Spring. You will flunk out. Therefore I am offering you a
short lesson in the fine art of ‘‘Nosing.”’

First and perhaps most effective of all ‘‘nosings”’ is the brown-
nose. The history of the brownnose is a well-documented and
odorous success story; idiots, queers, and athletes have all risen
the ranks with their ingratiating probisc. The requirements for
good brownnosing are a decided lack of pride, a big nose, and fake,
but convincing laugh. You will need six cases of tissue paper to
make it through exams, a shovel to pile on and clean up the mess,
and an appointment with a plastic surgeon in early May. The
blacknose is just a deeper, more profound and lasting form of
brownnose. Blacknoses will forever be servile in their relations,
and statistics prove they have a harder time getting off the bottom
of the heap. In addition to the tools of a brownnose, I suggest you
carry a Brillo pad.

Pinknosing is a dying art, though it is practiced on this campus
with resounding success. As a cherubic, yet snotty prep you will
need tortoise shell reading glasses, aviator sunglasses, Mickey
Mouse drinking glasses, long-handled opera glasses (television),
shot glasses, and blue eyes help. A healthy wallet is a pinknose’s
greatest asset, and there are many rednosed teachers who would
gladly trade an A-note for a C-note. Linen handkerchiefs with the
W&L monogram are a must.

Whitenosing is addicting and conducive to sneezing and bloody
noses. A lot of whitenoses have already flunked out, but they say
it’s fun and stimulating. You’ll need a straw and at least one
automatic weapon: a dead (rich) pinknose is a happy (high)
whitenose. Girls love whitenoses, and you might even get one to
blow your nose for you.

If you are a greennose, hang it up in the closet and forget about
success. You might try a pickaxe if your fingers are getting dull.
Blow hard and keep on blowing. God bless you all.

amendment change.

Last week 424 students voted
in favor of the proposed amend-
ment change while 190 voted
against. But too few students
voted and the amendment fail-
ed, prompting the EC to include
the revised amendment change
on Big Three ballots.

In other business, the com-
mittee heard monthly financial
reports from the Student Bar
Association and Mock Conven-
tion subcommittee.

Several members of the EC,
particularly Wills and Jeff Ed-
wards, expressed concern
about reported expenditures in
January and February of the
social committee of the SBA,
which has already spent about
90 percent of its budget, accor-
ding to Hop Xing of the SBA.

the social committee allocates
only enough money for about
200 students and that parties
are usually free.

Xing indicated that although
law school parties are opened to
all students, the SBA likes to
limit the parties to law
students.

Willis and Xing agreed that
both the EC and SBA will hold a
meeting this week to discuss
ways in which the two cam-
puses can unite and function as
one entity. Willis said more
cooperation is needed in order
to unite the law school with the
undergraduate campus.

A W&L student was assaulted
and a noise violation was issued
to a fraternity over Fancy
Dress weekend.

David Stevens, a W&L
sophomore, was beaten in front
of the Cockpit at approximately
midnight on Friday. Stevens
had gone outside to catch a
breath of fresh air when three
townspeople approached him.

One of the three then started
verbally abusing Stevens and
tried to start a fight with him.
Stevens refused and then the in-
dividual grabbed him and
began hitting his head against
the hood of a car that the other
two were standing next to.

Several W&L students were
consequently involved in break
ing up the fight between Stevens

and the townsperson. Stevens,
having suffered a concussion,
went to the infirmary.

Stevens is now pressing
charges against the individual
who assaulted him.

Responding to a complaint
made by City Manager John V.
Doane, the police shut down a
party at the Sigma Phi Epsilon
Fraternity house. SPE presi-
dent Chris Quirk received a
summons for violating the city
noise ordinance. The summons
claims that the violation took
place shortly after midnight on
Saturday.

SPE vice-president Henry
Sewell stated that the fraternity
did not receive a warning
before getting the summons.

The fraternity must appear in
court on March 17.

IFC Holds
Special

Nomination
Session

by Steve Perry

In a special meeting held last
night, the IFC received nomina-
tions for next year’s president
and vice-presidet. The can-
didates for the top spot include
Clyde Harkrader of Pi Kappa
Phi, Hall Vetterlein of Delta
Tau Delta and Scott Dacus of
Kappa Sigma.

Although only one person,
John McIntyre of Phi Delta
Theta, applied for the vice-
presidential post, Briscoe
believes more names will be ad-
ded before the final deadline,
which falls at 4 p.m. on Mar. 6.

In order to be eligible for
either position, a fraternity
member must have at least two
signatures. The elections will be
‘held on next Monday, with the
voting booths being open from 9
a.m. until 4 p.m.

In the event that no candidate
wins a clear majority of the
votes, a run-off election be-
tween the top two finishers will
be held the following Monday.

Interfraternity Council presi-
dent Monty Briscoe unveiled
several proposals Tuesday
night in an attempt to resolve
the ongoing battle with the Lex-
ington Police Department over
noise violations. With the aid of
local attorney Eric Sisler,
Briscoe drew up a list contain-
ing four suggestions to amend
the current city ordinances.

Briscoe’s first suggestion was
to increase the hours in which a
fraternity could play amplified
music from 12 a.m. to 1 a.m.
Briscoe believes that the extra
hour would result in a decrease
in summonses issued. Briscoe
stated that the fraternities
would be more willing to shut
down a band if they knew that
they were getting their money’s
worth.

In return for extended time on
noise permits, Briscoe sug-
gested that the police be given a
list of the presidents of each
house, with the understanding
that they alone would be charg-
ed with the noise violation.

Presence Of Mushrooms Is ‘Shocking’

(continued from page 1)
mushrooms”’ like L.S.D. cause
either good trips or bad trips.

And in Busch’s opinion, the
girl he treated on Friday was
taking a bad trip in that the
mushroom she ate caused both
bad emotions and feelings of in-
security.

As one example, Busch said
that the girl was ‘“‘lucid’’ when
she entered the infirmary, but
that she was also “scared to
death.” In trying to describe the
girl, Busch said that she was
“just very frightened.”

Busch speculated that one
reason for the girl’s bad ex-
perience may have been that
her body was not ready to han-
dle the mushroom’s different
chemicals. “She had had no
food all day and she took the
mushroom about three hours
before seeing me,”’ said the doc-
tor. “She said she felt funny
about a half-an-hour after tak-
ing it.”’

Busch could only speculate on
the cause of the girl’s condition
because psilocybin is ‘‘a very
unpredictable drug,” according
to Leonard Jarrard, a

psychology professor at
Washington and Lee who has
Studied the effects of
hallucinogenic drugs.

panelists will examine the ob-
jectives of the presidential news

chaired a study of presidential
press conferences at the White
Burkette Miller Center of the
University of Virginia last year,
will provide an overview of that
commission’s report.

The second session will be at 8

will serve as panel moderator,
presents the opening remarks.
Moyers currently is editor-in-

Jarrard said he was ‘‘shock-
ed’”’ to hear of the incident
because psilocybin is not in-
digenous to the Rockbridge
area. ‘I’ve never heard of it in
this area,’’ said Jarrard.
“Usually it comes from Mexico
or the more tropic regions.”

Jarrard went on to explain
that psilocybin is more

than LSD.”

One danger Jarrard noted is
that users of psilocybin may be
subject to relapses. Jarrard
said that these relapses, which
may result in “fairly perma-
nent changes,’’ sometimes oc-
cur as much as “‘two or three
months” after the psilocybin is
ingested.

because its effect on the brain is

“There are more motor and

substances,’’ said Jarrard. ‘‘In

History Of Magic Mushrooms

by Bill Whalen
The history of ‘magical
mushrooms” is as_ cloudy,
mystical and bizarre as the
trips the fungi produce.

According to Drugs From A
To Z: A Dictionary, ‘‘magical
mushrooms’’ were used as far
back as the times.of the Aztecs
of Mexico. The mushrooms
were used then as a sacrament
in religious ceremonies. The
text states that modern Mex-
ican Indians used mushrooms
for divination and worship.

Albert Hoffman, the
discoverer of LSD-25, analyzed

psilocybe mexicana, one form of
Mexican mushrooms, in 1958,
and was able to isolate
psilocybin, an_ hallucinogenic

alkaloid found in_ the
mushroom. Hoffman later syn-
thesized psilocybin.

The text say that Indians who
ingest mushrooms in religious
rites usually eat at least a dozen
at a sitting. The book says these
mushrooms have “a bitter taste
and acrid smell.”

“The initial reactions are
nausea, muscular relaxation,
coldness of the limbs, dilation of
the pupils, and then abrupt

mood changes, often
characterized by wild hilarity...

“After this comes the visions
— brilliant colors,
geometrical patterns, and
myriad scenes sometimes
perceived as if from a lofty
height, as well as aural
hallucinations...They last four
to five hours and are followed
by lassitude, physical and men-
tal depression, and a loss of
time and space perception.”

The psilocybe mexicana is “a
small tawny mushroom which
grows in marshy pastures,
often in cow pats.”

The final session will be at 10
a.m. Saturday, March 7, with
the panelists considering possi-
ble alternatives to the present
news conference format.

Funds ‘from the American
Broadcasting Company and
Landmark Communications
are supporting the event which
has been coordinated by Hamp-
den H. Smith, associate pro-
fessor of journalism and com-
munications at W&L.

Another person who express-
ed dismay over the incident was
John Read, the Common-
wealth’s Attorney. ‘“‘I am_ in-
deed upset with the fact that
such an action would take place
in Lexington,”’ said Read. The
Commonwealth's Attorney
stressed that had the girl been
reported to the police, ‘‘she
would have been arrested and
placed in jail.”

Read, who said he has only
limited knowledge on the topic
of ‘‘magic mushrdoms’’ and

‘psilocybin, said that this was
the first time he has known
about this sort of incident in
Lexington.

Dr. Busch likewise noted that
the experience was new to him,
and said he had never run into a
mushroom problem either at
W&L’s infirmary or in the
emergency room of Stonewall
Jackson Hospital.

Read said that without the
names of either the girl or her
date, no legal action can be
taken. Busch said that he could
“recognize the boy if he saw
him.’’ The doctor said he has
since forgotten the girl’s first
name.

Society Shows ‘Aguirre’

by Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society presents this Friday
and Saturday, March 6 and 7,
Aguirre, the Wrath of God
(Germany, 1973), directed by
Werner Herzog. The film will be
screened at 8 p.m. in classroom
“A” of Lewis Hall, free of
charge.

Werner Herzog is one of the
two most important directors to
emerge from the West German
film renaissance which began
in the 70s. The other major
director is Rainer Werner
Fassbinder, whose Marriage of
Maria Braun was seen here in
January. Whereas Fassbinder
is interested in the way in which
people maneuver within the
limits imposed by society and
civilization, Herzog is in-
terested in transcending the
limits which ordinarily press

upon human experience.

This quality of his work was
recognizable in the two films by
him seen here in earlier series:
The Great Ecstasy of the
Sculptor Steiner (1975), which
concerns Walter Steiner, the
world’s greatest ski jumper;
and The Mystery of Kaspar
Hauser (1975), which concerns
the attempt to “civilize” a
young man who has grown up in
almost total darkness and isola-
tion from human contact.

Aguirre is the stunningly
photographed story of a 16th
century Spanish expedition in
search of the mythical city of El
Dorado. Testing themselves
against the Amazon River, its
jungle and natives, and,
ultimately, their own
egomaniacal aspirations, the
conquistadors enact Herzog’s
characteristic ca to

human limits. The group, which
never returns, is headed by the
charismatic Klaus Kinski as
Aguirre.

Working in extremely hazar-
dous locations, Herzog carries
into the area of film-making his
ethos of challenging human
limits. As ‘‘auteur,”’ he is the
conquistador/explorer his film
is ambivalently about, thus
closing, in one way, the circle of
artistic self-consciousness
which the New Wave _in-
augurated in film.

The next films in the series
will be Luis Bunuel’s §serio-
comic That Obscure Object of
Desire (Spain, 1977), scheduled
for March 27 and 28, and Georgi
Shengelaya’s great poetic
biography Pirosmani (Russia,
1971), scheduled for May 1 and
2.

— Film Notes

Blazing Saddles (1974) Mel Brooks’ rowdy, flatulent comedy
about a black sheriff in a 19th-century western town. Wild, dirty
and pretty funny, this is regarded by many as Brooks’ masterpiece
(I’ll vote for Young Frankenstein) and it is as pure an example of
his particular brand of humor as anything he’s ever done. A compe-
tent cast helps: Gene Wilder, Cleavon Little, Madeline Kahn,
Harvey Korman, Slim Pickens and Brooks himself, with a guest ap-
pearance by Count Basie and his orchestra. Presented by the SAB
Friday through Sunday, March 6-8 at 7 and 9 p.m. in duPont
Auditorium. Admission is $1.

 

Padre, Padrona (Italy, 1977) Widely acclaimed as one of the
finest Italian films in recent years, this is a stark, lyrical account of
a shepherd who emerges from a life-long isolation to teach

Bye Bye Walter

 

This Is The Way It Is

by John Wells

Tomorrow night Walter Cronkite, CBS institu-
tion, journalistic sage and uncle of us all, will sign
off the air as news anchorman for the last time.
Ever.

Well, there’s no sense in crying now. It’s not as if
he’s being swept away from us suddenly; his suc-
cessor was announced nearly a year ago. But that
doesn’t make it any less sad.

My memories of Walter are personal ones. As a
small child, I used to confuse him sometimes with
another avuncular countenance and TV favorite,
Walt Disney (maybe it’s because they both had
moustaches, receding hairlines, friendly eyes and
the same first name. )

It was Walter who taught me a guerilla was not
an armed ape, he who explained to me early on the
electoral process and our system of government.
His Saturday afternoon ‘‘You Are There’’ pro-
grams were corny and wonderful.

Cronkite led me through recent history. He told
me about Vietnam, Watergate, the hostage crisis
and the new beginning. It was he, not the chief
justice, who swore in Nixon, Ford, Carter and
Reagan. Riots, assassinations, revolutions, wars,
victories, defeats, fires, floods, the stock market
and just about everything else, Walter was there.

He went with Ike to Normandy, followed Nixon
to China and Russia, and participated in a phone-
in talk show with Jimmy Carter. He kept me in-
formed during the hours of coverage surrounding
the Nixon resignation, and when I turned on the
tube one morning last year he grimly told me
about the aborted rescue attempt in Iran.

And the political process! Surely Dan Rather or
someone at CBS will have enough sense to keep
Walter on hand for at least part of the national
conventions and election returns. After all,
they’ve dragged Eric Severied out of the
mothballs from time to time in the years since he
retired, and he was never as popular as Uncle
Walter.

Cronkite is one of the last news veterans who
worked his way through newspapers in the Thir-
ties to radio in the Forties and television from the
Fifties oneward. His news programs are simple in
format, judicious in editing and have consistently
offered the most complete news coverage in the
limited environs of network TV.

The antithesis of the Cronkie show may be found
in ABC’s World News Tonight, the People
Magazine of TV news whose equivalent may be
found only in the movie Network. It is therefore
galling that ABC, gloating over the departure of
their highly-rated competition, took out full page
newspaper ads Wednesday bidding Uncle Walter
farewell.

Even worse, Frank Reynolds, who tries so hard
to be Uncle Frank, is reportedly writing a little
tribute to Walter for the end of his Friday broad-
cast. Please, please spare us! Reynolds loves to
interject this kind of personal pish posh in suppos-
ed straight news broadcasts where it has no
business. Who didn’t want to vomit last week
when, after a story on Prince Charles’ engage-
ment, Reynolds ingratiatingly said ‘‘That’s
grand’’? Walter can say more with an eyebrow
tremor or a lip twitch than Reynolds could verbal-
ly report in an entire broadcast. .

Before I sound like I’m trying to canonize Uncle
Walter, I should like to point out that he is by no
means immune (particularly in recent years) to
flubbing lines, looking at the wrong camera and
continuing to run his mouth into a commercial
break. His vacation time rivals that of Johnny
Carson.

Cronkite has been accused of being anti-Nixon in

 

Cronkite’s programs have
consistently offered the most

complete news coverage in

the limited environs of TV

 

1973 and pro-Carter in 1976 (certainly not 1980). In .

his book The Powers That Be, author David
Halberstam chastises Walter and his men for be-
ing too kind and mellow in their analysis following
the Nixon resignation speech. My telly was in-
disposed a couple of weeks ago and I caught
Walter in color several evenings at the student
center. I was forced to leave one night. when a
fellow student switched from CBS to NBC saying
“Y’m not gonna watch Cronkite’s ------- liberal
reporting!’’

But he has that great voice and style, sharp-
looking clothes and an air of genuine decency. His
almost daily exposure over the years has given
him a familiarity in American homes similar to
Archie Bunker and J.R. Ewing, but in an at-
mosphere of reality and a position of credibility.
He is the ‘‘most trusted man in America,’’ the
quintessential reporter.

What will happen to CBS News following tomor-
row night’s wake remains to be seen. We may as
well wish Danny Boy good luck, after all he’s bet-
ter than Reynolds or Chancellor. And we can be
partially sustained by Walter’s presence in other
news shows and specials in future years; at least
we are not mourning his death.

But that’s not much comfort now.

Candidates For The EC’s Big Three Answer Que

The Ring-tum Phi asked all candidates for the big
three to answer the following questions. We hope their
answers will help you decide whom you want to run
your student body government and honor system.

Myers President

I, Why are you running for the office you have selected? 100-word
limit

1) The primary reason I am running for E.C. president is that my
current year on the E.C. has been such a positive experience. As a
junior representative, I have involved myself to a degree which I
find meaningful. I would like to extend this involvement to include
the duties of president, such as presiding during honor trials, serv-
ing on University Council and the Student Affairs Committee, as
well as serving as a loyal spokesman for the student body.

2. What are your qualifications for the office which you are campaign-
ing? 50-word limit

) [have gained a great deal of experience this year on the E.C.

This experience has helped me to develop a philosophy that the
E.C. should, to the fullest degree, examine all issues that affect
Washington and Lee students. Other than my duties and activities
on the Committee, I have been involved in various student body
organizations which have served to broaden my perspective on stu-
dent life.

3. The position you seek entails work in two areas: distribution of stu-
dent body funds with administrative duties in overseeing the organiza-
tions which receive funds; and responsibility for upholding
Hashington and Lee's Honor System. Specifically, what problems do
you forsee in either or both areas and how would you deal with-these
problems? 200-word limit.

3) The Budget Hearings held early every fall determine how the
student body tax is allocated between the many campus organiza-
tions. This distribution of funds requires close scrutiny of expen-
ditures committed by these organizations, not just at the time of the
actual allocation but throughout the year, or as long as the
organization in question continues to spend student body funds.
Problems associated with distribution of student funds arise at
Budget Hearings because each organization strives to do a bigger
and better job than last year. For the E.C., this invariably means
that the funds must be allocated judiciously, with an eye to increas-
ing the budget of the big organizations (SAB, Ring-tum Phi, SBA)
at a reasonable rate, while at the same time trying to encourage
fledgling student organizations with modest yet necessary in-
crements. It is the responsibility of the committee to keep tabs on
the actions of its subcommittees. yet as a rule, the subcommittee
chairman and officers run a fairly tight ship.

The Honor system is undoubtedly the most- cherished and
respected tradition to be found at Washington and Lee. Many Honor
systems seem to have gone out of vogue on many college campuses,

 

 

ERIC MYERS

but it has been my experience that honor among gentlemen is the
rule rather than the exception at Washington and Lee. In the past
few years, there has been much talk of a separate honor system at
the law school. This proposition would pose many questions, as
things stand now, yet this type of problem is exactly the nature of
problems I think will be in the minds of the students in the future. A
current problem affecting colleges is the rising tide of legal
challenges to their honor systems. ‘Io avoid this ever-present
possibility at Washington and Lee, the committee must adhere to
and abide by t hite Book. The president in particular, must be
well versed wit .. White Book so to lend safe direction to the com-
mittee’s actions.

 

 

 

Averett Vicepresident

I. Why are you running for the office you have selected? 100-word
limit
‘1. The office of vice president is an important position requiring a
great deal of time, responsibility and conscientious effort. I feel
that the Washington and Lee students want a capable and hard
working man that will represent them in a legitimate and har-
monious fashion. Therefore, I will fulfill my duties with vigor, striv-
ing to incorporate the general will of those who elected me.

2. What are your qualifications for the office which you are campaign-
ing? 50-word limit

2. Ihave had the opportunity to represent both my Freshman and
Sophomore class as president. I was appointed chairman of the Stu-
dent Control Committee. Furthermore, I have been an active
member of the Student Affairs Committee and the University Coun-
cil
I believe that these positions have qualified me to aspire to the

 

JAMES AVERETT
position of vice president. Moreover, I feel that these qualifications
will aid greatly in the duties I assume.

3. The position you seek entails work in two areas: distribution of stu-
dent body funds with administrative duties in overseeing the organiza-
tions which receive funds; and responsibility for upholding
Washington and Lee's Honor System. Specifically, what problems do
you forsee in either or both areas and how would you deal with these
problems? 200-word limit.

3. I have had to deal with the distribution of student body funds
with administrative duties in overseeing how these funds were
used. I see no problems that might arise in the future as far as the
financial matters go. Furthermore, I will take whatever measures
necessary to explore new ways of handling any financial problems
which might arise.

When one speaks of Washington and Lee, one speaks of tradition.
The honor system is an integral and persuasive part of this tradi-
tion. In this area, I see no problems that could arise in the future,
However, one must always be prepared to restructure and over-
come these problems that might hinder the honor system at
Washington and Lee. Trouble does persist by itself when problems
arise; only when those in a position to lead do not alleviate the pro-
blem. If Iam elected I will be firm but fair.

Thank you for your support.

5 ALENT ATEN ATES ANCE ATION EEE EAE TSIEN

White Vice president

I. Why are you running for the office you have selected? 100-word
limit

1) I believe that being secretary of the Student Body this year
gives me the experience and the confidence to execute the office of
vice-president well. Experience has provided me with insights that
only actual workings on the committee could provide. For instance,
I will be in a position to view committee workings closely without
being constitutionally bound to daily specific tasks. This would
allow me the latitude to bridge personality gaps and alleviate bar-
riers before small problems are blown out of proportion. As vice-
president I would make a conscious effort to coordinate the wishes
of the sub-committees, Executive Committee, and the student
body.

2. What are your qualifications for the office which you are campaign-
ing? 50-word limit

2) My experience during the last three years at W&L has given
me an excellent foundation on which to act as a student represen-
tative. In addition to serving as secretary of the student body, I was

 

BUD WHITE
vice-president of my class for both my freshman and sophomore
years, vice-chairman of student control for one year, member of
the student financial aid committee, and a member of the student
recruitment committee. I feel that these positions have afforded
me the opportunity to work closely with various facets of campus

life —undergraduate, law school, administration and faculty.

3. The position you seek entails work in two areas: distribution of stu-
dent body funds with administrative duties in overseeuis, ihe organiza-
tions which receive funds; and responsibility for upholding
Washington and Lee's Honor System. Specifically, what problems do
you forsee in either or both areas and how would you deal with these
problems? 200-word limit.

3) A conflict might arise next year between a demand for new
organizations on campus and available student body funds. As vice-
president I will watch closely the way in which money will be
distributed. If a problem arises I will not hesitate to look for ways to
finance new organizations. I will stress a hardline as far as
budgeting goes, however, I will never shirk my responsibilities in
providing the student body with a diverse set of groups and ac-
tivities.

As far as the Honor Code is concerned, I do not see any major pro-
blems. To be sure it will be challenged to some degree, but
criticism of the system provides it with an inherent dynamic quali-
ty. If any great disparities exist in the White Book at this time, it is

its inconsistent language. There i is no consistency in the ide behind
‘the system!

 

 

Witherington Vice president

1. Why are you running for the office you have selected? 100-word
limit

1) As a member of the Student Activities Board for the past three
years (secretary this year), member of the Student Recruitment
Committee and treasurer of my fraternity, I’ve expressed a diver-
sity of interests. This involvement is important to me and it’s
something I wish to continue. In running for vice-president, I'd like

 

BLAKE WITHERINGTON
to take an active role in what I feel lies at the heart of W&L,
specifically, the Honor System and to be a part of t® Proper func-
tioning of the other student organizations.
2. What are your qualifications for the office which you are campaign-
ing? 50-word limit

2) My experience as a fraternity treasurer will be helpful in
regard to the financial aspects of the E.C. As technical adviser to
students accused of-honor offenses, my active and diversified
background will enable me to bring fresh ideas and a new perspec-
tive to the interpretation of the White Book.

3. The position you seek entails work in two areas: distribution of stu-
dent body funds with administrative duties in overseeing the organiza-
tions which receive funds; upholding

and responsibility for

Washington and Lee’s Honor System. Specifically, what problems do -

you forsee in either or both areas and how would you deal with these
problems? 200-word limit.

3) The Honor System is something that most students would
agree is very important to W&L. Its interpretation varies with each
student generation and even with each E.C. But, I think the spirit of
the Honor System has been maintained. Unfortunately, there
always have been and, probably, always will be honor violations.
However, I think if we can erase any ambiguities which exist within
the system itself, thereby preventing students from rationalizing
actions which might be of a questionable nature — from the stand-
point of honor — I think the system would be greatly improved. In
situations involving money, there is always room for disagreement
as to the proper method to disburse the funds. This has been evident
this year with charges of mismanagement lodged — whether cor-
rectly or incorrectly — against some student organizations. I think
this year’s E.C. has done a good job of overseeing student funds and
perhaps with detailed monthly financial reports, much like those
presented by the fraternities to the school each month, next year’s
E.C. will be able to improve on its record.

Big Three
Elections Are

Monday

Roberts Secretary

1. Why are you running for the office you have selected? 100-word
limit ;
-1) I am running for this position because I feel that the of-
ficeholder should have adequate time to devote to the position, and
should have the organizational skills required to effectively com-
municate the business and proceedings of the E.C. to the student
body. I believe that I successfully meet this criterion.

 

 

 

 

   
   

DENNIS ROBERTS

2. What are your qualifications for the office which you are campaign-
ing? 50-word limit

2) Ihave held several positions at W&L that give me an adequate
background for being E.C. secretary. Last year I was a Mock Con-
vention state chairman and this year I am secretary of the Brass
Ensemble and secretary-treasurer of Mu Beta Psi (national
honorary music fraternity).

3. The position you seek entails work in two areas: distribution of stu-
dent body funds with administrative duties in overseeing the organiza-
tions which receive funds; and responsibility for upholding
Washington and Lee's Honor System. Specifically, what problems do
you forsee in either or both areas and how would you deal with these

The Ring-tum Phi, March 5, 1981, Page 7

estions On Their Qualifications

problems? 200-word limit.

3) With regard to the distribution and administration of student
body funds and upholding the Honor System, I perceive no earth-
shattering problems at this time. I feel that the administration and
supervision of organizations receiving student body funds has been
improved and that the system should continue to be fine-tuned and
perfected.

The Honor System and its preservation should be of the utmost of
concern. It is because of the Honor System that we enjoy many of
the freedoms that we do. The present E.C. has addressed the pro-
blem of White Book revisions. This should be studied and followed
up with the corrective action deemed necessary. Again, I see no
major problems in the immediate future.

 

 

Ross Secretary

1. Why are you running for the office you have selected? 100-word
limit

1) My reasons for seeking the position of secretary of the Ex-
ecutive Committee are twofold: First, the responsibilities and
obligations of the office are personally attractive. I would like not
only to serve Washington and Lee through this office, but to serve
this institution and its students capably and resourcefully as a
member of the Executive Committee.

Second, I believe that this position would allow me to better
represent the interests and the needs of all Washington and Lee
students. Issues such as co-education and the role of fraternities at
W&L are of vital importance to every student. However, it should

 
   

BENNET ROSS
on these issues that accurately reflects student opinion. I believe in
and stand for that responsiveness in student government.

2. What are your qualifications for the office which you are campaign-
ing? 50-word limit

2) My qualifications for this office rest, for the most part, in my
desire and ability to perform the tasks required of this position. I
possess more than adequate typing and note-taking skills, as well
as an ability to listen effectively. 1 have gained insight into the
University through service on the Student Recruitment Committee
and secretarial experience as secretary of the West Virginia
Delegation to the 1980 Mock Convention.

3. The position you seek entails work in two areas: distribution of stu-
dent body funds with administrative duties in overseeing the organiza-
which and responsibility for upholding

Washington and Lee's Honor System. Specifically, what problems do
you forsee in either or both areas and how would you deal with these
problems? 200-word limit.

3) In the past, the distribution of funds and the administration of
dependent organizations has been managed effectively by the Ex-
ecutive Committee. However, with the emergence of new organiza-
tions and other groups with pressing financial needs, a re-
evaluation of the budgetary process and emphasis is required.
Stress should be placed on maintaining present organizations while
improving developing groups through a firm financial committ-
ment on the part of the Executive Committee. Moreover, the E.C.
should use this monetary license to maintain rigid input into the
operation of these dependent organizations. Weekly financial
reports are not enough; rather organizational efficiency and quali-
ty production should be concerns of the Executive Committee. The
Ring-tum Phi and the Ariel, as well as the SAB, should be evaluated
in terms of student feedback, as well as financial solvency.

In terms of the Honor System, the Executive Committee has
made appropriate constitutional changes and is in the process of
making continued corrections. For these reasons, I can forsee no
future problems with the system or its administrations by the Com-
mittee.

Big 3
Forum

by John Wells

Candidates for the three ma-
jor offices of Washington and
Lee’s Executive Committee ad-
dressed a number of student-
related issues at a candidate
forum held last night. The
forum was attended by two
Ring-tum Phi reporters and one
other student.

Candidates appearing at the
EC-sponsored event were: Eric
Myers, who is running for presi-
dent; Bud White, Blake Wither-
ington and Jim Averett, vice-
persidential candidates; and
Bennett Ross and Dennis
Roberts, who are running for
secretary.

The candidates stated their
qualifications and then respond
ed to questions posed by
moderator Willie Mackie, the
current vice president of the
EC, and the two Phi reporters
Questions and answers are
printed below; it should be
noted that few of the questions
were addressed by all of the
candidates.

Should the single sanction of
the honor system remain in-
tact?

Averett said he voted against
the sanction while on the Stu-
dent Control Committee, and
said he feels that the sanction is
more broadly interpreted than
the constitution intended. The
other five candidates said they
believe the sanction should be
preserved, with Witherington
calling it ‘‘all-important”’ to the
honor system.

Should the EC _ publicly
itemize its finances as the sub-
committees are required to
do?

White said that the commit-
tee’s mid-term financial
disclosures could be reported on
a monthly basis. He said he
could not at this time support an
itemization of funds pertaining
to honor trial expenses, even in
an ambiguous manner. Myers
and Witherington agreed on
both points.

Should the Ring-tum Phi be
allowed to cover open honor
trials?

Myers said that the White
Book rules pertaining to this
matter were written for the
benefit of the accused. He said
that past coverage of open

The Various Careers

This is the fourth in a series of ar-
ticles by Sports Editor Ralph
Frasea.

Precious few athletes have
the requisite skills, desire, and
determination to play a sport on
the professional level. Those
who do are in an elite group, to
be sure. However,
demonstrating proficiency of a
professional calibre in one sport
was not good enough for Joe
Lyles. He played professionally
in two sports, baseball and
basketball.

Lyles was a standout athlete
for St. Louis University 1947-49,
which he attended on a basket-
ball scholarship. Lyles was a
member of that school’s Na-
tional Invitational Tournament
championship team of 1948.

‘One of the greatest thrills of
my life was being a part of the
NIT champions,’’ he recalled.
We had a_ 33-2 record, and
ranked first in the nation.”

The lure of a_ professional
baseball contract prompted
him to leave St. Louis U. after
his sophomore year. A pitcher
and outfielder, Lyles signed
with the old St. Louis Browns
organization (who have since
become the Baltimore Orioles)
during the summer of 1949. He
had also been pursued by the
Yankees, Cubs, Cardinals, and
Reds.

“I made the mistake of get-
ting caught up in the fantasy
world of sports. Leaving college
was a mistake, but at that point
I wasn’t thinking about my
future.”

After spending the summer in
the minor leagues, Joe was con-
tacted by the NBA’s St. Louis
Bombers, who also offered the
Missouri native a contract.
After giving it much thought,
Lyles agreed to sign, although
such a decision involved a great
deal of personal sacrifice.

“IT enjoyed playing two
sports, but I missed having an
off-season. As soon as baseball
was over, I started basketball
season,”’ Lyles stated.

Joe worked his way up
through the Browns’ system,
and by 1951 was one of their top
minor league prospects.
However, Korean War service
interrupted his career, and
eventually ended it.

“During my stint in Korea, I
incurred a painful back injury
which sidelined me for some
time.”

Lyles returned to the Browns,
but was placed on the injured
list due to his ailing back. The
crosstown rival St. Louis Car-

dinals were in need of pitching,
and acquired Lyles from the
Brownies. However, Joe
couldn’t regain his previous
form, and retired. He tried a
comeback as an outfielder with
the New York Giants in 1954,

but broke his hand, which, com-
bined with the haunting back in-
jury, forced a permanent end to
his professional baseball
career.

Lyles also had an interesting
basketball career. After signing
with the St. Louis Bombers, he
spent several years playing
minor league ball, hoping to
break into the NBA.

In 1952, he was selected to the
U.S. All-Stars, the first team to
travel the globe on a goodwill
basketball tour, organized by
Bob Hope. The team journeyed
153,000 miles, playing in such
world centers as_ Berlin,
Munich, London, Paris, Colon,
Rome, Zurich, and Cairo.

Lyles and his teammates
played over 1000 games on the
world tour, averaging about ten
games per week.

“That trip was one of the
highlights of my life,’’ recalled
Lyles. “We were guests of the
Royal Family at Buckingham
Palace, Holland’s Queen

Julianne, and Pope Pius XII.
Everywhere we went, we
played before throngs of ap-
preciative fans.”’ '

After winding up his basket-
ball career, Lyles resumed his
college education, earning his

 

degree at Springfield College in
1958, and his master’s the
following year.

Upon completion of his
master’s degree, Joe Lyles was
hired by Washington and Lee

University, where he took over,

not only as jayvee basketball
coach, but varsity soccer and
baseball coach, as well. He re-
mained in charge of JV basket-
ball for eight years, guiding the
frosh to a 54-46 overall record.
He remained at the helm of the
soccer and baseball teams until
the mid-1970’s. Although not
currently associated with any
W&L sport, he has been anac-
tive Phys Ed professor, taking
particular pride in his in-
dividualized and unorthodox
teaching methods.

When three-year baseball
coach Chuck Kroll left W&L
after being denied full-time
status and the corresponding

J.V. Important To
Basketball Program

by John Harrison

One does not have to look very
hard to understand why- the
W&L JV basketball team finish-
ed the past season with a subpar
1-6 mark.

As usual, the Generals’
schedule included prep school
powers Massanutten Academy
and Fork Union, which boasts of
basketball standouts Dale
Solomon of Virginia Tech, and
Kentucky’s Melvin Turpin as
two of its recent graduates. An
even bigger problem was
created for W&L’s hoopsters

when traditional rivals
Hampden-Sydney and .
Randolph-Macon, who were

scheduled before the season
began, cancelled their pro-
grams; thus, the team found
itself lacking four games
against comparable opponents.

Another problem arose in
mid-season, when three key
members of the varsity team
came up with injuries. When
R.J. Scaggs was forced to miss
the second half of the season
due to a wrist injury, and both
George Spears and Carby Hoy

salary, Joe Lyles’ name was
mentioned as a possible suc-
cessor.

Lyles is philosophical about
his professional career. “I
believe that sports teaches a
person that failure is not the end
of the world. I just thank God
that I had the opportunity to
play pro ball. It enabled me to
do things for people. Besides
entertaining, I have been for-
tunate enough to visit crippled
and diseased children in many

were forced to sit out a few
games, varsity coach Verne
Canfield and JV coach Howard
Ainsley were forced to put
Henry Bond, Frank Eppes, Jay
Fechtel and Bill Yates, all of
whom had been playing for both
the varsity and JV squads, on
varsity exclusively. This move
left the JV squad with only
seven members. So, in addition
to having an abbreviated and
unbalanced schedule, there was
virtually no bench strength for
half of the season.

Coach Ainsley does not see
the season as a complete loss.
“‘It was a good experience for us
to go up against some tough
teams. What made it even more
difficult was that we were a
smaller team than most of our
opponents. Even so, I believe
most of the guys proved
themselves.”’

After noting that the varsity
squad is losing seniors Rob
Smitherman, Hoy and Scaggs,
he added that the rosters of next
year’s varsity and JV teams -
would depend heavily upon
whom the coaches can recruit.

hospitals, and they are always
excited about visits from
athletes. I loved making them
happy.”

“I miss pro ball now and
again,’’ Lyles admitted.
‘“‘Whenever I go to a game, I
remember how it used to be. I
remember the camaderie be-
tween the players, the locker
room shenanigans, the fun and
closeness we shared. I do miss
it sometimes.”

Cagers End Season With

Disappointing Loss To H-SC §

by Dale Park

The Washington and Lee var-
sity basketball team ended its
1980-1981 season with a disap-
pointing 60-58 loss to rival
Hampden-Sydney College on
Thursday, February 26, in the
quarterfinal round of the fifth-
annual ODAC Championship
Tournament, held in Salem, Va.

The Generals. held a 32-28
halftime lead after twice
holding leads of seven points. In
the second half, H-S fought back
to take a 42-41 lead and took a
58-56 advantage with only 55
seconds left. Junior guard
George Spears, who led his
team with 15 points, hit a pair of
free throws to tie the score at 58
with 39 seconds left. Following a
time-out with seven seconds re-
maining, H-S got the win when
guard William Barbour tipped
in a missed shot at the buzzer,

Ironically, it was W&L’s Rob
Smitherman who hit a shot at

the buzzer in last year’s ODAC
Championship game that beat
H-S.

“This was an ironic loss,”
commented head coach Verne
Canfield. “But if you play this
game long enough, the breaks
will even out. I am not totally
happy with the way we played
against H-S, although we stuck
to our game plan fairly well.
Again, our total team concen-
tration was lacking.’’

While the Generals did not
win in the tournament, two
W&L seniors, center Smither-
man and guard Carby Hoy,
received top ODAC basketball
honors. Smitherman was
selected to the ODAC All-
Conference first team; Hoy was
named to the ODAC second
team. Hoy and Smitherman led
their team in scoring, averag-
ing 14 points per game apiece.

“Rob and Carby have proven
themselves to be fine athletes

and fine gentlemen at W&L,”
Stated Canfield: “The all-
conference honor is a fine
reward for their efforts and per-
formances.”’

The Generals finished with a
16-10 overall record, the 14th
winning season in Canfield’s 17-
year tenure.

The eventual winner of the
ODAC tourney was Roanoke
College. The Maroons held true
to their top seed, defeating
eighth-seeded Bridgewater Col-
lege (81-70), fourth-seeded
Hampden-Sydney (76-65), and
sixth-seeded Lynchburg College
(78-53) on their way to the
crown.

Roanoke will now take its 26-1
record to Upsala College in
East Orange, N.J. this Friday
and Saturday, March 6-7, to

Tournament.

Track Team Third In Meet

440-yard relay team of Bob fourth.

by Rick Swagler

The Washington and Lee
track team placed third in last
Saturday’s ODAC Indoor Track
Championship, aided by a
record-tying performance by
sophomore Gene Fellin. Coach
Norris Aldridge said, ‘‘We ran
well. I was really proud of our
young men,”’

Individually for W&L, Kevin
Kadesky won the 60-yard dash,
John McKee won the shot put,
and Fellin tied the school record
in the pole vault, attaining a
height of 13 feet 3 inches.

The mile relay team of Billy
Morris, R.J. Scaggs, Kevin
Kadesky, and Errol Skyers cap-
tured first place. Russ Rector
placed second in the triple jump
and fifth in the high jump, and
Alan Armitage was second in
the 60-yard high hurdles. The

Kadesky, and Keith Kadesky
received the third place ribbon.
R.J. Scaggs took third in the
440-yard dash, but in the words
of Aldridge, ‘‘wasn’t quite
ready.” Paul Chapman placed
third in the 880, and the team
composed of Crews Townsend,
Chapman, Howard Herndon,
and Keith Kadesky finished

Jon Kelafant was sick and did
not compete in the meet, which
may have hurt the team.
However, Keith Kadesky, who
missed the Lynchburg Relays
the week before the champion-
ship due to a broken toe, was
back in fine form Saturday, as
evidenced by his performances
in the 440 and two-mile relays.

Lax Team Wins
Exhibition Easily

by Robert Massie

The Washington and Lee
University lacrosse team open-
ed its exhibition season last
Saturday afternoon with a 20-6
victory over the Virginia Beach
Lacrosse Club, despite the
absence of several key players.
Head coach Jack Emmer said
that Virginia Beach wasn’t as
challenging as he expected, but
the two remaining pre-season
games, both scheduled for this
weekend, will be different.

Emmer stressed that both of
the upcoming opponents, Mount
Washington and Chesapeake,
will be difficult to beat. ‘‘We’ve
got a tough weekend with these
back-to-back contests against
two talented, strong club
teams.’’ Mount Washington
boasts of an impressive roster,
which includes several former
W&L players, such as_ ex-
goalies Bob Clements and
Charlie Brown. Chesapeake has
already beaten UMBC, and has
lost games against Maryland
and Navy by only one goal.

Despite the loss of eleven
players from last year’s squad,
Emmer feels that he has a very

REVIEW and OUTLOOK [

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

El Salvador

E] Salvador is a minute country on the west coast of
Central America. We uaually leave comments and
thoughts on national affairs to the professionals,
however, many Washington and Lee students had to
register for the draft this fall and we think the situa-
tion developing in the little country deserves some
comment.

We can not and will not pretend to be experts on the
Reagan Administration and the plans it has for deal-
ing with the increasing troubles developing in central
America. Most people know by now that the United
States is increasingly concerned by the situation and
that the United States is taking a harsher stance
across the board in cases of any possible perceived
threat to the nation. Some people have mentioned that
El Salvador and its implications closely resemble the
earlystages of Viet Nam. We ask all of you to monitor
the El Salvador situation closely, developments there,
could make a significant difference in your future.
The Washington and Lee campus is often noted for its
apathy, but the Mock convention last spring
demonstrated that students are concerned by
developments on the national and international scene.
You all have representatives in the House of
Representative and the Senate, send them letters
stating your view on El Salvador and the course of ac-
tion our nation should follow.

 

The SAB & F.D.

We would like to congratulate the student activities
board for putting on such an impressive Fanny Dress.
At the beginning of the year we heard EC President
Bob Willis ask the SAB to throw the best Ball ever
—they did. Now we will have to wait and see the EC’s
reaction to the best ball the SAB could throw.

The Big Three

Once again it is time to elect the first three —
possibly the most important three — members of the
Executive Committee. For the second time in as
many years the candidate for president is running
unopposed. We are happy to see more candidates than
in years past campaigning for vice president and
secretary, yet we are worried that more students are
not interested in becoming president of the student
body. We feel compelled to ask two questions. One is if
the only candidate for president so far is the only
qualified candidate. If so, the oppurtunities to gain
leadership qualities at W&L must be limited. The
other question in our minds is why no one else wants
the job. Try to remember that president of the student
body is the most important office a student at
Washington and Lee can hold. Anyone interested in
leading Washington and Lee should start gaining ex-
perience now for the next election. It seems difficult
to have a choice when only one candidate runs for a
post and it is upsetting that only one person would
seek the highest position on campus.

‘The Ninth Step’ Comes Highly Recommended

by M. Shaw Pyle

We ought to give this up for
Lent (don’t panic, though, we
wouldn’t disappoint you folks
like that; for one thing we’re
having too much fun). Every
time we have to review new or
experimental theatre around
here, it turns cold. And it rains.
And we have to walk in the slush
all the way to the Boiler Room
Theatre. For a world premiere,
they could have at least ordered
better weather.

Honestly, if the productions
weren't decent, we’d doubtless
succumb to apoplexy (uncross
those fingers now). But for now,
our health is safe (would you
cut the boos?) and we are
delighted to report that the
future of W&L theatre is in
equally good shape. If anyone
doubts this proposition, he has

The reconcilliation she must ef-
fect with the 18-year-old
daughter she left behind eight

the ramifications of love
without guts.

The script is, in a word,
superb. But scripts don’t make
for tolerable evenings. Acting
does — and.did. Despite opening
night dialogue misfires, there
wasn’t a bad performance in
the lot. Ginger McNeese as
Joanna, the alcoholic heroine,
was So impressive as to make
us forget who she is in front of
the footlights. She didn’t act the
lead. She wasthe lead. Pam
Simpson, as the yenta mentor,
Eleahor, was the sort of friend
even sober people need. Nancy
Stone turned in a work of art —
not craft — as Joanna’s

The Ninth Step is the story of

by the pressure of other folks’
expectations: the demands of

Internship Allows Students Chance To Watch Criminal Process

by Steve Perry

Joel Segall is examining the
file of a woman charged with
arson and grand larceny. After
locating the needed informa-
tion, he moves on to another
“rap” sheet. Segall is not a
lawyer, he is a W&L student
who, along with three other
seniors, works for the Com-
monwealth’s Attorney.

Al Hintz, Rob Brooke, Mike
McFadden and Segall assist at-
torney John Read in a program
known as the ‘‘victim-witness
assistance program.” The pur-
pose of this program is to
prepare the victims and
witnesses of a crime for their

day in court through pre-trial
conferences, which strengthen
a case and relieve the victims’
anxiety about testifying.

The VWAP allows W&L
students the unique opportunity
to participate in a criminal case
from the initial hearing to the
final sentencing. Although the
students enjoy virtually all the
aspects of their job, they agree
that watching their work come
together in court is the most in-
teresting.

They participate in all areas
of this program, including pre-
trial conferences, plea-
bargaining, and backroom
discussions over strategy.

The students’ experience has
not been limited to the court
room. They have also visited
the Richmond Penitentiary in
hopes of understanding the en-
tire process of criminal law in
the state of Virginia.

Although misdemeanors are

the most commonly tried cases -

in Lexington courts, W&L
students have had the oppor-
tunity to work in many felonies
as well. These felony cases in-
clude the Carl White. murder
trial, earlier in the year.

The intership program was
organized by Dr. David Novack
of the sociology department
upon a request by Mr. Read. Dr.
Novack believes that the VWAP

is a natural extension of the
liberal arts education offered at
Washington and Lee. He added
that there are many pre-trial
benefits derived from a_ pro-
gram of this nature, including
the presentation of a paper bas-
ed on actual work experiences
at the end of each term. Al Hintz
has been selected to present his
paper to the Virginia Social
Sciences Foundation, and
Segall is presently under con-
sideration for a similar honor.
The course is worth three
credits and requires a
minimum of six hours work
each week, with additional time
spent in court. The course is
designed for those students

seeking independent study.
Hintz noted, ‘‘the internship has
given me the opportunity to

‘it was instrumental in my ob-
taining an internship for this

Although a large commit-
ment is necessary, the students
are glad they participated.

Dr. Novack said that the pro-
gram is open to anyone who
wishes to participate and even
though the deadline for

has passed, interested students
may sign-up for the fall term
during pre-registration, or at
the beginning of the term next
year.

Myers, Ross Winners;

IFC To Hold Run-Ott

Eric Myers and Bennett Ross
captured two of the EC’s big
three offices in Monday’s elec-
tion. The vice-presidential race
failed to produce a majority
winner, and a run-off was held
today.

Myers, who is currently one
of two junior representatives on
the EC, received 314 votes or 68
percent of the 461 ballots cast in
the EC presidential race.
Myers’ chief competition came
from John Vavala, a second-
year law student and write-in
candidate. Vavala received 120
votes for 26 percent of the total.

In the EC vice presidential
contest, Bud White, a junior,
and Jim Averett, a sophomore,
advanced to today’s run-off.
White won Monday’s election,
gathering 222 of the 541 votes.
Bud White’s share represented
only 40.8 percent of the total.
Averett finished second with 180
votes or 33.1 percent.

The race resulted in a plurali-
ty because a junior, Blake
Witherington, received slightly
more than 24 percent of the
votes. Only the top two finishers
advanced to today’s run-off.

In the campaign for EC
secretary, Bennett Ross out-
distanced his opponent, Dennis
Roberts. Ross finished with 354
of the 5619 votes for a majority
of 57.2 percent. Roberts
gathered 249 votes, leaving him
with 40.2 percent of the total.

The EC’s proposed constitu-
tional amendments once again
failed because a majority of the
student body did not vote. Only

36 percent of the student body
voted on the amendments, leav-
ing the EC approximately 240
Short of legitimizing the
changes.

The LFC
Results

On Monday afternoon, elec-
tions were held for the offices of
IFC president and _ vice-
president.

The current IFC president,
Monty Briscoe, stated, ‘‘the
voter turn-out was very poor.
Only 350 ballots were cast.”’

While the fraternities were
successful in electing a vice-
president, John McIntyre of Phi
Delta Theta, they were undecid-
ed over the choice of president.

Fire at Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity

Causes Estimated $12-15,000 Dama

by W. Cope Moyers

An agent from the arson divi-
sion of the Virginia State Police
began sifting through the rubble
Monday afternoon following a
weekend fire that heavily
damaged the Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity house. The _in-
vestigator immediately ruled
that the blaze, which occurred
during a party, was either in-
tentionally or accidentally
started by someone.

Although the investigation
will probably not be concluded
until later in the week, special
agent L.R. Thomas said the fire
was not caused by an electrical
short.

“It’s hard to tell now what ac-
tually happened, but it was not
electrical,” said Thomas.

The blaze, which occurred
about 1:00 a.m. Sunday morn-
ing, did extensive damage to
the third floor library and
storage room, and caused some
water damage in other areas of

tensive had several fraternity

smoke detectors. Two fraterni-
ty members heard the alarms

Ruby Dee: Monday Performance Is

Ms. Dee’s one woman perfor-
mance, ‘‘An Evening with Ruby
Dee,’’ was surely a treat for all
those in attendance at Lee
Chapel Monday. Her dramatic
and satirical interpretations of
poems and plays written by
such well-known black writers
as Langston Hughes, Nikki
Giovanni, and Gwendolyn
Brooks made the evening a
most pleasurable experience.
With her abundant feminine
charm, Ms. Dee also enthralled
the audience with several
original works.

A guest speaker presented by
the Student Association For
Black Unity, Ms. Dee’s works
centered around the Black
man’s experience in America,
and how this is reflected in his
writings and unique cultural
background. A_ native of
Harlem, New York, Ms. Dee
divulged to the audience some
experiences she encountered as
a young black woman struggl-
ing to survive in a theatrical
world not readily open to
Blacks. Only through her self-
awareness as a black was she

Ray Scherer, former NBC White House Correspondent

by John Wells

Various aspects of the
presidential news conference
were discussed at Washington
and Lee University last
weekend by a distinguished
group of panelists familiar with
news conferences from both
sides of the presidential
podium.

A series of three discussions
Friday and Saturday in Lee
Chapel titled ‘The Presidential
News Conference: Problems
and Promises,” produced in-
dividual recommendations and
featured insightful, articulate
and often highly entertaining
discussion by experienced pro-
fessionals.

Members of the panel were
Bill Moyers, press secretary
during the Johnson administra-
tion, who served as moderator;
Ron Nessen, press secretary to
President Gerald R. Ford; Ray
Scherer, former White House
correspondent for NBC; Frank
Cormier, Associated Press cor-
respondent at the White House;
Clark R. Mollenhoff, former
Washington Bureau chief for
the Des Moines Register and
Tribune; and Bill Plante, CBS
White House correspondent.
Ex-governor Linwood Holton of
Virginia was a special guest.
The only no-show was Sam
Donaldson of ABC News, who
remained in Washington for
President Reagan’s news con-
ference on Friday.

ferences, the panelists discuss-
ed various aspects of the event
and the study’s recommenda-
tions. ;
Scherer read an overview of a
study he co-chaired with Gov.
Holton at the White Burkette
Miller Center of the University
of Virginia last year. The
recommendations, many of
which have so far been incor-
porated by the president, are as
follows:

News conferences should be
held monthly, on a_ regular
basis.

These large functions should
be staggered with smaller, in-
formal meetings held weekly
with a few reporters and no TV
cameras.

Reporters should remain
seated, raising their hands to be
called on by the president.

Reporters should be selected
at random in the form of a lot-
tery.

Most of the panelists opposed
the lottery system idea. Cor-
mier said it makes the event
“‘stilted...cut and dried.”’
Nessen said the seated arrange-
ment detracts from the drama
and liveliness of previous occa-
sions.

Regarding the lottery system,
which produced numerous
questioners from small publica-
tions, Moyers asked if
‘‘parochial represenatives”’
should be allowed to par-
ticipate.

Cormier, a White House
veteran from 1962-1980, flatlv
opposed the idea. Too often, he
said, White House press passes
are issued to reporters with
‘dubious credentials.’ Plante,

who has covered the new ad-

ministration since the January

VBVVUVVUVYVGL,

)

inaugural, gave a qualified yes,
saying most interests are best
served by the largest publica-
tion. Scherer answered yes,
saying that in a democracy,
“everybody should be given a
chance.”’

The panelists concluded that
the press conference began its
decline following’ the
Eisenhower administration,
and suffered severely under
Presidents Nixon and Carter
with a brief respite under Presi-
dent Ford. Ronald Reagan
received scattered praise from
the group, Scherer finding it
“‘refreshing’’ that the president
can say “I don’t know’’ in
response to a question, and
Plante saying Reagan has got-
ten off to a good start with the

press corps.
In his opening remarks dur-

ing Friday night’s session,
Moyers said that there has been
disorder in the White House and
society in general since 1961.
Since then, said Moyers, we
have had, for various reasons,
five unsuccessful presidents.

Beginning in 1961, said
Moyers, press conferences
were transmitted live on nation-
wide TV. Discussing the impact
of television of the news con-
ference, Cormier complained
that the TV cameras have at-
tracted “attention seekers’’ in-
stead of reporters during the
last two decades.

Mollenhoff said that
presidents have ‘“‘used’’ the
televised press conferences to
their advantage from the begin-
ning.

‘Jack Kennedy was more in-
terested in promoting himself
than democracy,” he said.
Mollenhoff said the late presi-

reporters he knew would ask

about scandals in the defense
and agriculture departments.
Presidents Johnson and Nixon
engaged in the same practice,
according to Mollenhoff, whc
concluded that television has
contributed to the superficiality
of press conferences and the ig.
norance of news editors.
Scherer said that TV has pro-
vided a great benefit in taking
the event to the entire country.
Nessen said the TV cameras
create tension by simultaneous-
ly changing the nature of the
vent and providing the presi-
dent with the best means of
reaching millions of people.
Plante called the TV camera
“‘an unrelenting observer’ and
said it has changed the nature

Moyers listed the goals of the
news conference as laid out by

are:

To allow the president to be
questioned regularly.

To keep the president well in-
formed.

To communicate the presi-
dent’s ideas to the bureaucracy.

To propogandize.

To demonstrate how the

SAB’s Fancy Dress Expenses

by Bill Whalen

The SAB announced the costs
for the 1981 Fancy Dress week-
end totalled nearly $33,000. The
SAB also announced at an EC
meeting Monday that receipts
for FD amounted to almost
$27,500.

According to a report submit-
ted to the EC, the net loss for
this year’s Fancy Dress was
slightly less than $5,500. But
after the SAB spends an addi-
tional $1,100 to cover the cost of
playbills, the deficit should
amount to almost $6,500.

The EC was initially critical
of several facets of the ball, in-
cluding security and the handl-
ing of the coat room, but later
praised the SAB for its produc-
tion. The main concern of the
meeting was to determine ex-
actly why the deficit occurred.

“Ticket sales were down by
200 from last year,” said SAB
Co-Chairman Pryse Elam, who
noted that the SAB tried to
make the Fancy Dress produc-

Gov. Dalton Claims

by Cope Moyers

In a 40-minute pep talk aimed
at the Washington and Lee
Young Republicans, Virginia
Governor John Dalton said last
night that the future appears
bright for the Republican Party
in the Old Dominion.

Dalton told a small audience
in Lee Chapel that the G.O.P. is
“on the move,’’ particularly
because the party has, in his
words, one of the best organiza-
tions in the United States.

The governor said he cut his
teeth in politics in Virginia
when he was president and
chairman of the statewide
Young Republicans during the
1950’s. Dalton went on to say
that the status of the
Republican Party has radically
changed since he was a student
at William and Mary College.

tion ‘‘totally self-sufficient.”’

The SAB’s other co-
chairman, Jamie Small, was
quick to defend this year’s ball
and claimed that entertainment
was better than usual. ‘We
spent almost $21,000 for music
this year,’’ said Small, ‘‘and I
think that made the ball.”’

Elam also attributed some of
the high cost to music, stating
that in John Prine’s Thursday
night concert, W&L “got its
Spring concert early.”’ By hav-
ing Prine, Elam said the SAB
had put nearly $8,000 into
Thursday night alone.

Musical entertainment did
provide a majority of the SAB’s
expenses. In addition to Prine,
the Peter Duchin Orchestra
cost $7,000, Roomful of Blues
cost $2,000, Riders In The Sky
cost $1,200, Wedsel’s Edsels
cost $1,000 and the Original Dix-
ieland Strutters and Bill Clary
each cost $600.

The EC spent a portion of the
session discussing the various

“Virginia has moved from a
one-party state to a very viable
two-party state between the
time I was state chairman of
the Young Republicans and
now,’’ said the governor.

Dalton used _ Virginia’s
previous voting patterns as sup-
port for this claim, saying that
when he was 20 years old, the
state had never voted for a
Republican candidate for any
position. But except for
Virginia’s support of Lyndon
Johnson in 1964, Dalton said the
State has voted for the
Republican Presidential can-
didate for the past three
decades.

The governor echoed the sen-
timent of the National Gover-
nors’ Association when he told
the audience that now is the
time to reduce the role of the

strengths and weaknesses of
this year’s ball. Senior
Representative Marshall Clark
was critical of the way the coat
room was run, saying that its
management was “‘a farce.”’ ©
Both SAB co-chairmen said
that the decorations had been
vandalized, with Elam noting
that someone attempted to steal
both a poster in front of Carole
Chappel’s office and the direc-
tory it was placed inside.
Discussing attendance, Small
warned that it would not be
feasible to move Fancy Dress
into the Doremus Gymnasium
because of the lack of time and
the conflict with athletic teams.
Small mentioned that it takes
‘nearly two weeks to set up in the
University Center, and it would
be difficult to have the gym for
a comparable amount of time.
One reason for moving to the
gym is the amount of people the
ball attracts. Fire regulations
allow only 2,500 people in the

that over $25 million in state

Dalton defended his ad-
ministration’s efforts during
the past three years, particular-
ly in the trimming of tax rates.

The governor said that during
his administration, electric,
telephone, real estate and in-
heritance taxes have been cut,
resulting in a $250 million
decrease in state tax revenues.

Dalton said he supports the
Reagan Administration’s
budget cuts but hopes that both
the Appalachain Regional and

are not eliminated.

nn ln. Notes

Midnight Cowboy (1969) John Schlesinger’s seedy film about
seedy characters in New York City. Well-made, trashy and rather
pointless, but compelling and pretty accurate. The star perfor-
mances help make it, with Jon Voight as a Texas boy turned hustler
and Dustin Hoffman as the slimy, disgusting Ratso. Not exactly a
family flick; it helped usher in the age of ‘‘gutsiness’’ to movies and
received the Academy Award for best picture despite its X-rating.

Well Paced ‘Ninth Step’,
Kind Words For Cast

 

by M. Shaw Pyle

‘Ninth Step,’ Take Two.

The following, our Lenten
Penance, is an adaptation of the
version of last weeks’ review of
Tom Zieglers’ The Ninth Step,
uninterupted by commercials.
Don’t touch that dial. )

The Ninth Step is the story of
a woman who is striving to
overcome her alcoholism. The
symptoms, the drinking, are
escapable, the underlying
causes are not. For years, she
has been tossed hither and yon
(not to mention yon and hither)
by the pressure of other folks’
expectations: the demands of
her mother, her church, her
husband. Never had_ she
developed the inner core that
alone can stabilize the soul. As a
result, she drinks. Like a fish.
This is not food for her mar-
riage or her life, both of which
promptly fall apart. Finally,
she turns to A.A. to rebuild her
life; a process based on A.A.’s
12-step program. It is on the
“Ninth Step’’ — the necessity to
make amends to the other vic-
tims of one’s alcoholism — that

the herione becomes stalled.
The reconciliation she must ef-
fect with the 18-year-old
daughter she left behind eight
years ago is the point of depar-
ture for Ziegler’s exploration of
the ramifications of life without
guts.

The only saving grace of the
W&L drama department is that
it’s fantastically competent.
The facilities are cramped, the
weather is on somebody else’s
side (every production gets
rained on), and the critic we
freely confess, is a grouch. But
they just keep rolling along.

The script is, in a word,
superb. But scripts don’t make
for tolerable evenings. Acting
does — and did. Despite opening
night dialogue misfires, there
wasn't a bad performance in
the lot. Ginger McNeese as
Joanna, the alcoholic herione,
was so impressive as to make
us forget who she is in front of
the footlights. She didn’t act the
lead. She was the lead. Pam
Simpson, as the yenta mentor,

Eleanor, was the sort of friend
even sover people need. Nancy
Stone turned in a work of art
—not craft — as Joanna’s
employee/victim Maria.

Rachelle Erwin, who has the
charming earnestness of a
Hollins style of Gilda Radner,
did a bang-up job as the wrong-
ed daughter, Melissa, and Cyn-
di Weeks left us frankly aghast
as the street child A.A. member
Tracy — aghast at the
character, which is just what
Ziegler was aiming for.

The light and sound system
—and the voice over, echoes
from Joanna’s past — were
highly effective. But it is not in-
novation or even showcase per-
formances that makes Ninth
Step such an important as well
as an interesting work. That
rests upon Ziegler’s ability to
point out that people with no
convictions can be quite as
dangerous as those with no
scruples. Think about it, little
ones.

Writer to Speak

Author Mignon Holland
Anderson will present a lecture
in Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. on
Wednesday, March 18, as part
of the university’s Black Em-
phasis Month.

A 1966 graduate of Fisk
University where she received
a B.A. degree in English and
comparative literature, Ms.
Anderson received a graduate
degree from Columbia Univer-
sity in 1970.

Ms. Anderson has written
numerous articles and short
stories which have been
published in magazines and an-
thologies. In 1976, a collection of
her short stories was published
by the Third World Press of
Chicago. The volume is entitled

‘Mostly Womenfolk And A Man
Or Two.”’

Formerly editor of ‘Black
Communicator,’’ a_ tele-
communications journal based
in Washington, D.C., Ms.
Anderson is an advisory and
contributing editor to The New
Virginia Review, Inc., and was
selected by The Virginia Center
for the Creative Arts to be an
artist in residence during
August, 1980.

Ms. Anderson, her husband,
son and daughter live in Dum-
fries, Va., where she is current-
ly working on a novel.

Black Emphasis Month at
W&L is sponsored by the Stu-
dent Association for Black Uni-
ty. Ms. Anderson’s lecture is
open to the public.
 

If the Class of 1980 is any in-
dication, W&L graduates are
doing quite well in today’s
crowded job market and com-
petitive graduate and profes-
sional schools. Members of the
university’s most recent bac-
calaureate class are — for the
most part — doing what they
want to do, according to
Michael A. Cappeto, associate
dean of students and director of
career development and place-
ment.

Cappeto bases this belief on
the findings of the Placement
Office’s annual survey of recent
graduates. More than 83 per-
cent of the 1980 graduates
answered questions about their
graduate study or jobs as well
as their salary, career plans
and orientation. The survey,
which was not undertaken until
October 1980, allowed
graduates ample time to con-
duct a job search or begin
graduate study.

While some graduates _in-
dicated they were not admitted
to the law, medical, business, or
graduate school of their first
choice, they were nevertheless
accepted somewhere, in most
every case their second or third
choice. Likewise, most
graduates who began looking
for jobs found them and in-
dicated they are satisfied with
the work they are doing.

Almost one-third, 30.2 per-
cent, entered graduate and pro-
fessional school as full-time
students, slightly less than last
year’s 35.7 percent. But, accor-
ding to Cappeto, ‘‘these
Statistics should not be regard-
ed as a valid measure of the
percentage of W&L alumni who
pursue graduate education,
since there is a growing trend
for students to work a few years
prior to pursuing a graduate
program.”

For the fifth year in a row,
more undergraduates entered

law school than any other single
type of graduate study — 14 per-
cent in all, a figure that has re-
mained fairly constant over the
years. The University of
Virginia topped the list of law
schools with 1980 graduates in
the first year class (five),

‘followed by W&L’s law school

(four). All told, graduates are
enrolled in 23 different law
schools, ranging from Duke to
Georgetown to Oklahoma to
Rutgers.

The number of graduates
entering other graduate or pro-
fessional programs, business

school, medical school, or
graduate programs, is down
slightly from a year ago.

Nearly three percent entered
M.B.A. programs at nine
schools, including New York
University, Tulane, and the
University of Texas. Nine
medical schools, such as Louis-
iana State, Virginia, and
Vanderbilt, were represented
by 4.3 percent of the graduates.
And nearly nine percent of the
Class of 1980 entered graduate
school programs other than
law, business, or medicine.
Graduates reported entering 18
graduate schools, including
Cornell, Dallas Theological
Seminary, the Pratt Institute,
and Texas A&M, to earn
degrees in nearly 20 different
fields, such as_ geophysics,
mechanical engineering,
psychology, interior design, and
architecture. Cappeto noted the
decline in recent years of
graduates entering humanities-
related graduate programs.

The second half of Cappeto’s
report deals with graduates
who went to work immediately
after graduation. Nearly 60 per-
cent of the graduating class ob-
tained jobs after graduation.
This figure is slightly higher
than the five year average, 57.4
percent. The business profes-
sions, education, and the
military were the most popular
careers.

 

The report distinguished be-
tween a job and a career — a
career being the type of work
composed of one or more
related jobs. The report noted
that ‘‘statistics show that dur-
ing his working life, the typical
college graduate will have three
different careers composed of
twelve different jobs. Also, to-
day’s college graduate is ex-
pected to keep his first job for
about two years. Therefore, it is
important to keep in mind that
the results of this study show
the types of jobs and (maybe)
the first careers entered by the
recent graduates. Results are
not predictions of future
careers of the Class of 1980.”

Slightly more than half of the
graduates who did not enter
graduate or professional school
received job offers on or before
graduation day. About 10 per-
cent received jobs in each of the
five months following gradua-
tion so that by late October
(when the survey was made)
only 7.6 percent of the class re-
mained unemployed. All but six
unemployed graduates _in-
dicated they had just recently
started their job search or were
not seeking work. Cappeto con-
cluded that ‘unemployment af-
fects only an_ insignificant
number of recent W&L
graduates.”

In terms of employment
quality or underemployment
(the underutilization of skills,
education and human resources
which is a serious problem in
labor markets today ) graduates
again fared well. Although 15.7
percent of job holders believed.
they were underemployed, only
8.7 percent saw no future in
what they were doing.

To measure the job satisfac-
tion of recent graduates, ques-
tions were asked about job
challenge, long range career
goals, salary, geographic loca-
tion, and type of work. In
general, the Class of 1980 seem-
ed satisfied with its jobs.

More than 85 percent found
their jobs challenging while 67.3
percent indicated that their job
was consistent with their long
range career goals. Most (67.9
percent) said they were
satisfied with their salary and
even more (85.6 percent) with

Wittig To Lecture On
College Curriculum

Susan Wittig, dean of Tulane
University’s Sophie Newcomb
College, will speak at
Washington and Lee University
on “Community and Consen-
sus: The Structure of a College
Curriculum,”’ on Monday,
March 16, at 8 p.m. in Room 327
of McCormick Hall. Wittig’s
visit is sponsored by the Univer-
sity’s Ad Hoc Committee on
Liberal Education. The public
is invited to attend.

Wittig received her B.A. from
the University of Illinois and
her master’s and doctorate
degrees in English from the
University of California at
Berkeley. She taught at the
University of San Francisco
and the University of Texas
before becoming associate dean
of the Graduate School at Texas
in 1977. She has been associate
professor of English and dean of
Sophie Newcomb (the women’s
division of Tulane University)
since 1979. Her research has
been supported by such
organizations as the Danforth
Foundation, the Alfred B. Sloan
Foundation, and the National
Science Foundation.

An acknowledged expert in
the field of general college
education requirements, Wittig
is the author of more than 20
scholarly books or articles, in-
cluding “‘A Theory of Multiple
Meanings,” ‘‘Stylistic and Nar-
rative Structures in the Middle
English Verse Romances,’’ and
“The Computer and the Con-

cept of Text.”
The Ad Hoc Committee on
Liberal Education was

established last year at the re-
quest of Washington and Lee
President Robert E.R. Huntley
to study problems associated
with and offer suggestions for
strengthening liberal arts
education at Washington and
Lee. The committee will host a
reception following Wittig’s
talk.

ROTC

Awards

(continued from page 3)

In order to achieve their new
status, each of the students had
to accomplish a number ot
tasks, including competence in
land navigation and compass
reading, technical knowledge of

the M-16 rifle and military
radios, and a rigorous survival
Swimming course, most of
which was conducted in full
military equipment. Finally,
they had to pass an extremely

demanding physical fitness test
which required them to perform
six chin ups in one minute, 55
push ups and sit ups in under
two minutes per event, and last

to run a timed two miles in
military boots, carrying a rifle.
Good conditioning was obvious-
ly a significant factor in their —
selection as cadet Rangers.

Note: This is the fifth and final in-
terview in’ a series by Sports
Editor Ralph Frasca

Ah, we've come to the last in-
terview of the series. Not by ac-
cident, I've saved the top man
for last. When one speaks of
Washington and Lee faculty
members who have played or
nearly played professional
sports, Athletic Director Bill
McHenry must certainly be in-
cluded.

An alumnus of good ol’ W&L,
McHenry was a standout foot-
ball and lacrosse player for the
Generals. Playing center and
linebacker (they played two-
way in those days), he was the
last gridiron standout of the era
in which W&L was a major col-
lege football team.

The captain of the 1953 team,
he was voted the outstanding
athlete at W&L in his senior

 

Bill McHenry as he looked in his playing days.

 

Hoy Named Assistant
Basketball Coach

by Rick Swagler

Carby Hoy has been named to
the position of Assistant Basket-
ball Coach, effective next fall.
The announcement was made
by Head Coach Verne Canfield.

In a decision made last year,
Canfield created the position
especially for Hoy, who will
primarily help assistant coach
Howard Ainsley with the junior
varsity responsibilities,
scouting and recruiting. Hoy
will not be a full-time assistant,
next year and hopes to continue
his schooling.

When Canfield was asked
about Hoy’s involvement in
what has come to be known as
the “Boxwood Incident,’’ in

which a number of students,
mostly basketball players,
damaged 37 English boxwood
bushes on campus, he replied,
‘‘What the hell does that have to
do with his coaching and
teaching ability? That’s all
history. He’s paid his dues.”
Canfield noted that Hoy finished
his career with 920 points, and
had he not been suspended last
season, most likely would have
joined Rob Smitherman in scor-
ing over 1000 career points. On-
ly six players have accomplish-
ed this feat under Canfield.

Canfield commented, ‘‘Carby
has tremendous potential and
I’m pleased to offer him the
job.”

The Playing Days

of Bill Mc Henry

year. Other honors included
selection to the Blue-Grey
squad, as well as the College
All-Star team, which faced the
National Football league defen-
ding champion Detroit Lions.

Unfortunately, a shocking
cheating scandal which rocked
the foundations of W&L oc-
curred several days before the
class of 1954, Mc Henry’s class,
was to graduate. A number of
students were involved, most of
which were football players.

“Someone got the key to a
room where the final exams
were run off, and made more
copies of the tests. These were
distributed to all those involv-
ed,’ McHenry reports. ‘‘I didn’t
know anything about it.””

Because most of the guilty
football players held athletic
scholarships, the administra-
tion effected a drastic change in
the sports program.

“There were no divisional
classifications like there are
now. Back then, schools either
had major-college or small-
college athletic status. The ma-
jor colleges were permitted to
grant athletic scholarships, the
small colleges were not,”’
McHenry stated.

Due to the financial drain of
major-college status, W&L had
given consideration to swit-
ching over, but the embarrass-
ment caused by the scandal
forced the school to opt for
small-college status. Athletic
scholarships were’ thus
eliminated, although scholar-
ships held by W&L students at
that time were honored.

Regarded as one of the top
college football players in the
nation at that time, McHenry
was contacted by every one of
the NFL teams. He was even-
tually drafted in the sixth round
by the Washington Redskins.

“The Redskins’ owner,
George Marshall, showed a lot
of interest in me, and I an-
ticipated being drafted by
Washington. However, when it
came time to discuss my con-
tract, Marshall offered me only
$5,500 plus a $500 signing bonus.
That was a small amount of
money even in those days!"’

McHenry was then contacted
by the Hamilton Tiger Cats of
the Canadian Football League.

“The NFL had no American
competition in the 1950's,”
recalled McHenry. ‘‘Thus the
CFL engaged in ‘player piracy,’
offering better contracts to
athletes who were disgruntled
with the meager NFL wages.”’

However, two days before he
was to report to the Tiger Cats’
training camp, he was drafted
into the United States Army.

“It was at the tail end of the
Korean War, and I was all
ready to report for football
when I received my draft
notice. I asked the Army for a
deferrment so that I could play

~ coaching position,
Huntley asked McHenry to take’

football in 1954, but they denied
my request. As it worked out, I
wasn’t given my orders until
the following January. I lost a
year of football while waiting
tor my orders.”’

McHenry was discharged in
August of 1956, whereupon he
was again offered a contract
with the Tiger Cats, but he
chose to enter coaching. With a
wife, and a child on the way, he
was looking for security. Thus,
he accepted a coaching position
at Widener College. In 1958, he
took the job of head lacrosse
coach at Williams College.
Three years later, he became
the Athletic Director at
Lebanon Valley College, a post
he held until 1971.

Former W&L Athletic Direc-
tor Gene Corrigan, who current-
ly holds the same position at
Notre Dame, accepted the A.D.
post at Virginia in 1971. With the
job vacant, alumnus McHenry
was contacted.

“I was very excited about
returning to my alma mater,”’
he said.

When Buck Leslie stepped
down from the football head
President

over. He led the team for five
years, until he hand-picked
Gary Fallon as successor.

McHenry’s coaching days are
not over, though. He is beginn-
ing his second year at the helm
of the JV lacrosse team.

“I like to keep my hand in
coaching and maintain contact
with the students,”’ he noted.

The JV squad will primarily

play varsity opponents. They

open against the Notre Dame
varsity.

Rumors have been . cir-
culating about the prospect of
McHenry accepting the post of
Athletic Director at the Univer-
sity of Maryland.

‘“T have been contacted by
Maryland, but rumors that I
have been definitely offered the
job are premature. I’m not sure
that I would accept it even if it
was offered.”

The tall, ruggedly handsome
McHenry has served on the
NCAA Rules Committees for
both football and lacrosse, was
past President of both the
United States Intercollegiate
Lacrosse Association. and the
United States Lacrosse Coaches
Association, is currently Presi-
dent of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference, Vice
President of the Virginia Sports
Hall of Fame, sits on the Board
of Directors of the Lacrosse
Foundation and Hall of Fame,
and presides over the W&L
Fellowship of Christian
Athletes, as well as many other
accomplishments.

It seems that the only direc-
tion for ex-college football star
Bill McHenry has been up-
wards. His achievements give
testament to his propensity for
success.

I have enjoyed writing this
series of interviews, and I wish
to thank Coaches Fallon, Em-
mer, Williams, Lyles, and
McHenry for their cooperation.

Lacrosse Team Wins

Both Exhibition Games

by Robert Massie

The Washington and Lee
University lacrosse team com-
pleted an undefeated exhibition
season last weekend with vic-
tories over the Mt. Washington
and Chesapeake lacrosse clubs.

W&L defeated. Mt. Washing-
ton for the first time ever, by a
score of 12-11. The game was
close throughout, with the
largest lead of the game belong-
ing to Mt. Washington, 11-7, ear-
ly in the third quarter.
However, the Generals rallied
for five consecutive goals and
held off Mt. Washington for the
win.

Bob Clements, W&L alumnus,
went all the way for Mt.

Washington in the goal, and

- Ware Palmer performed well in

his first tough game as the
Generals’ goalie.

Other standouts for W&L in-
cluded George Santos, Geoff
Brent and Rob Carpenter.

Sunday’s game against
Chesapeake turned out to be a
little easier, with the Generals
emerging victorious, 15-12. The
game was close during the first
half, but sharp passing and suc-
cessful outside shooting by the
Generals opened up a 3-goal
lead.

W&L opens its regular season
this weekend at home against
New Hampshire. Game time is
2:00, March 15 at Wilson Field.

Golfers Open Season

Led by coach Buck Leslie, the
W&L golf outlook appears quite
promising this spring, and
coach Leslie hopes to match, if
not improve, an impressive 13-3
record of a year ago.

Although it is too early in the
season to tell, the team line-up
seems very strong, namely with
junior Jim Kaplan, senior co-
captain Gerry Barousse, and
junior co-captain Bill Alfano
leading the squad. Several

   

other members appear equally
promising, including senior
Steve Everett, juniors Del
Agnew and Tim _ Good,
sophomores Jerry Moyer and
Tom Wohlfarth, and freshman
Bruce Blythe. Coach Leslie em-
phasizes compatability, and
states that team balance is key
to a successful season.

The golfers face University of
Rochester on Friday. The
match will be held at the Lex-
ington Country Club.

for his squad.

“I thought we could win the
ODAC,”’ asserted Canfield. ‘I
assumed that by tourney time
we would get it together. We
had a strong nucleus of veteran
players and, although I knew
Roanoke was favored to win, I
thought we could beat them
—and we did. I guess that’s why
the rest of the season was so
disappointing.”

For the Generals, their 96-79
rout of the Maroons on January
20th proved to be the high-water
mark for W&L basketball this
season.

Beating the then fourth-
ranked Roanoke team
catapulted W&L to 16th place in
the NCAA Division III polls a
week later. The Generals stood
at 12-3 overall, and their 4-1
ODAC mark had pulled them in-
to a tie with Roanoke for the
ODAC lead.

Then, in the same manner
that they had flashed in the top-
twenty nationally, the W&L
hoopsters suddenly soured.

Even Canfield cannot pin
down the exact reason why the
Generals went 4-7 in the second
part of the season, nor why they
lost in the first round of the
ODAC Tournament. Canfield
can only offer factors that he
feels added up to his team’s
* downfall.

Track

by John Harrison
It appears that the W&L track
and field team will have little
difficulty in matching last
year’s 12-5 record.

A good balance in experience
in almost every event should be
the Generals’ strongest asset
when they begin the new season
this Saturday against Davidson.
The meet will get under way at
11 a.m. Senior co-captains R.J.
Scaggs and Billy Morris head
the list of sixteen returnees,
with sixteen freshmen and
other newcomers completing
coach Norris Aldridge’s roster.

“In the first part of the
season, our concentration was
good and our attitude was
super,’’ stressed the coach.
“‘We wanted to beat people.”’

In that same month of
January, the Generals had
defeated a tough Saint Andrews
team, 79-72. Saint Andrews
subsequently made it to the
NCAA Division III Tournament.
How could a team good enough
to beat S-A then begin losing to
ODAC rivals such as Lynchburg
and Hampden-Sydeny?

Canfield offered that, in the
second half of the season, ‘‘we
began playing not-to-lose, in-
stead of playing to win. Also,
key players began to relax their
mental toughness and became
more individualistic.”’

Only a team effort, maintain-
ed Canfield, spearheaded by an
aggressive defense, will win
games for W&L. Yet, as the
coach stated, ‘“‘we began to
score less from our defense in
the latter part of the season. We
began to play defense just to
stop the other team, and not to
keep them from going into their
offense. As a result, our offense
became less effective.’’

In addition, the loss of senior
co-captain R.J. Scaggs to a
wrist injury in mid-January
created problems that became
more apparent as the season

_ progressed. Scaggs, a talented

senior from Roanoke, Virginia,
opened the season as a starting
forward for the Generals and
averaged ten points in the thir-

Aldridge has an optimistic
outlook, based on the strong
performances given by several
individuals of the winter track

_ team. “Overall, I was really

pleased with the results. We
were inexperienced in a few
events, as we will be this spring,
but that should not keep us from
being a solid team.” He also
believes that in addition to be-
ing capable of equalling last
season’s mark, his _ present
team should do as well, if not
better, in the ODAC as did last
year’s team. In fact, two of the
returnees are conference cham-
pions: Scaggs (400 meter) and

Canfield Reflects On Season

teen games he played.

Yet Scaggs’ loss was not so
much a blow scoring-wise as it
was a loss in_ leadership.
‘Scaggs had the ability to get a
timely basket or cause a turn-
over when the team really need-
ed a break,” noted Canfield.
‘Also, he was one of the top
defensive players I’ve coached
in my 17 years with W&L.”’

With the season over, Can-
field is undertaking a complete
shakedown of his entire basket-
ball program — keeping the
positive things, and throwing
out the things which, in his
estimation, don’t work.

“I’m not just going to look at
the offense and defense,”’ com-
mented Canfield. ‘‘I’m also ex-
amining our recruiting pro-
cedures and other aspects of the
program. I think this change
will be a healthy and positive
thing, and there will be
noticeable changes made.”’

Among his top priorities, Can-
field is looking to establish: ‘‘re-
clarification of roles’’ to stress
the team-play aspect; more
defensive changes (more
presses, etc.) to avoid becom-
ing “‘stagnant”’ defensively; a
continuity-oriented offense that
can be played without a big
man.

To implement these changes,
Canfield’s philosophy for next
year is simple: ‘‘I’m going to be
firm in my demands early on,
and get tougher as the season
progresses ~— maybe even
downright mean.”

Team Previewed

Mike Fogarty (javelin).
Aldridge says that he does not
know much about Davidson.
“‘Last year’s meet was cancell-
ed by snow. We beat them two
years ago down there, 74-71. I do

know that they have some good
hurdlers and field event men,
but I have not heard anything
about their sprinters. It should

be interesting, since our
previous meets with them have
always been fairly close.”’

He adds that the team worked
hard during the winter to get
prepared and is looking forward
to getting the season started.

Top Athletes Wind Up Their W&L Careers

by Ralph Frasca

and Rick Swagler

In only a few short months, a
number of Washington and
Lee’s top athletes will graduate,
thus ending their collectively
outstanding college athletic
careers.

Many seniors participated in
most of W&L’s intercollegiate
sports, and all deserve con-
gratulations for their dedication
and effort. However, a handful
of athletes merit particular at-
tention for their leadership,
dedication, and excellence of
play.

Coach Gary Fallon will lose
six seniors from his football
squad. Notable among them is
running back Chris Leiser, who
led the team in rushing with 555
yards. “I probably won’t fully
realize that my playing days at
W&L are over until next year,”
said Leiser. ‘‘When the guys
start practicing next fall, I'll
feel as though I’m supposed to
be with them, but I’ll realize
that I can’t anymore.”’

Leiser, who is currently play- -

ing on the Rugby team has
given serious thought to contin-
uing his football career in the
Canadian Football League, but
his future plans call for him
to attend the University of
Florida for two years to earn a
degree in architecture.

Fallon offered glowing praise
for his all-purpose back.

“Chris was a fine punt and
kickoff returner, as well as an
exemplary running back. He
really wasn’t big enough (5’6’’)
to play college football, but he
overcame the odds.”’

In the words of coach Rolf
Piranian, W&L soccer “has
turned the corner.” Instrumen-
tal in this feat were seniors
Bryan Williams and Kevin
Carney. Carney has played
W&L soccer through what Pira-
nian calls ‘the lean years’’ to
see the team progress from a
3-10 season in his freshman year
to a 9-4 mark this year. Carney
holds the school records for

career saves and career
shutouts.

Williams, who transferred
from Denison University follow-
ing his freshman year, has been
named team MVP for all of his
three years here. Other ac-
colades include the All-South
squad, and playing in the
Virginia All-Star Game. A knee
injury, according to Piranian,
“really slowed him, especially
psychologically, but a Bryan
Williams with an injured knee is
as good as any other player on
the team.”

ee r

Williams has been invited toa
professional soccer tryout with
the Charlotte Lightnin’ and is
considering a _ professional
career.

When Howard Herndon, who
shared the responsibilities of
crosscountry captain with
Charlie Warner this fall, arriv-
ed on the W&L campus four
years ago, he had never run
competitive cross-country or
track. His early goal had been
to just ‘“‘hang in there during the
workouts.’’ Instead of merely
accomplishing his initial goals,
Herndon continually raised his

goals, thus motivating himself
to give extra effort.

Herndon feels that W&L’s
athletic program allows
students ‘‘to enjoy sports’’ and
the accompanying ‘‘team
togetherness’’ without the
pressure of a _ scholarship-
oriented program. Herndon
typifies the scholar-athlete im-
age, having been selected for
Phi Beta Kappa honors, as well
as being chosen the cross-
country co-captain.

graduation is the basketball
team. Three of the tive
Generals’ starters (Carby Hoy,
Rob Smitherman, and R.J.
Scaggs) have played their last
games at W&L.

One of Rob Smitherman’s
primary reasons for attending
W&L was the opportunity to
play basketball.

“T’m glad W&L doesn’t offer
athletic scholarships, because I
wouldn’t have been able to play
much if I were competing for a
spot on the team with ‘paid’
recruits. The current system of-
fers students the chance to play

who ordinarily wouldn’t at a
scholarship school.”’

Smitherman doubts that he’ll
play organized basketball
again. Instead, he plans to

enter law school or teach high
school history.

Hoy, who has long wanted
to coach basketball on the col-
legiate level, was named to the
post of assistant basketball
coach (see related article)
Tuesday.

In reflecting on his years with
the basketball program, Hoy
will miss the camaraderie
which existed between players,
but notes that the team suffered
from a “lack of student body
support.”

Wrestling co-captain Dave
Stoeffel, a three year letter-
man, has proven that absence
does make the heart grow
fonder. As a junior, Stoeffel suf-
fered an injury which prevented
him from wrestling, but he
stayed close to the program and
was elected co-captain in his
senior year.

Coach Gary Franke _at-
tributes Stoeffel’s success to
“this willingness to work.”
Franke called Stoeffel an ex-
cellent example of ‘‘a good
leader” and a student ‘‘who
kept athletics and academics in
perspective.”

An interesting note about
Stoeffel is that until his
sophomore season at W&L, in
which the team finished with a
6-4 record, he had never wrestl-
ed for a winning team.

Stoeffel is a leader by exam-
ple who will surely be missed by
the grapplers next year.

Among the seniors which
W&L’s lacrosse team will lose
this year is George Santos. San-
tos stated that his first priority
is to help accomplish the team’s
goal of an NCAA playoff berth.
Secondly, he aspires to become
an All-American, and his third
goal is to “help the younger
players develop.”’

Santos believes that his
leadership role ‘thas become

more significant” but that the
‘leadership is spread out
amongst the other seniors.’’

The senior thinks that the
question of whether or not W&L
should offer athletic scholar-
ships is difficult and can see the
pros and cons. However, a com-
mon view held by W&L athletes
is that the lack of scholarships
motivates the players to beat
teams with scholarship players.

Santos is happy that more
emphasis has been placed on
conditioning, and states that the
team should be able to ‘‘out-
hustle’’ most of the opposition.

After graduation, Santos
plans to seek work experience
before enrolling in a Master of
Business Administration pro-
gram.

Tom Coates is the only senior
on a young baseball squad. With
14 new players on a 24 man
squad, Coates will be called
upon heavily to provide leader-
ship from his post as co-captain.

“TI really believe we can be
winners this season. We haven’t
had one in ten years.”’

Coates had an added incen-
tive for wanting to play with a
winner. His brother played with
the last winning baseball team,
and Tom wants to keep the
‘‘tradition’’ in the family.

The catcher has set numerous
personal goals for himself, in-
cluding a mid-.300’s_ batting
average, and a fielding percen-
tage of .980.

An accounting-business ad-
ministration major, Coates
plans to attend the University of
Baltimore Law School.

Golfers Jerry Barousse and
Steve Everett enter their final

season this spring.
Barousse has won All-
American and _  AIl-ODAC

honors, as well as many other
laurels under Buck Leslie’s
tutelage, and Everett has been
a dependable four-year per-
former.

Finally, the tennis team will
lose one of its most proficient
performers in recent years
when Pete Lovell graduates.
Lovell is expected to lead the
Generals to another fine season
under Coach Gary Franke.

Senior student-athletes such
as Leiser, Williams, Smither-
man, Coates, and others have
proved themselves as team
leaders and dedicated athletes.
The Washington and Lee com-
munity in general and the
athletic program in particulr
will miss the contributions of
these fine individuals.

Baseball Team Tops Robert Morris In Scrimmage

by Todd Barstow

While major league baseball
was revived in various Florida
and Arizona spring training
sites, wind-swept Lexington
was also the scene of diamond
action, as the Washington and
Lee Generals scrimmaged
Robert Morris Business College
Tuesday. The Generals took ad-
vantage of sloppy defensive
play by Robert Morris en route
to an 8-5 victory.

W&L drew first blood, scoring
four runs in the second inning.
Mark McLaughlin led off with a
walk. On a hit-and-run play,
Jeff Haggerty singled to center,
where the ball was bobbled.
McLaughlin steamed for home,
arriving safely. First baseman
Mike Walsh then singled, scor-
ing Haggerty. Walsh stole se-
cond, and moved to third on a
wild pitch. Don Dudley walked,
and another wild pitch sent
Dudley to second and Walsh
home. Catcher Tripp Brower
grounded out to short, but

Dudley alertly took third, scor-
ing on pitcher Rich Hachen-
burg’s sacrifice fly.

R-M came back in the fourth
with three tallies, the biggest
blow a two-run homer off
reliever Jim Halprin. A pair of
singles, a walk, and an infreld
out completed the run produc-
tion. With hurler Jim
Brockelman, who replaced

EC

(continued from page 3)
almost 3,000 people attended the
ball.

Small went on to add that
‘nearly 60 percent of the ad-
ministration attended the ball.”’
Junior Representative Tripp
Brower questioned whether
members of the administration
should be allowed to attend the
ball free of charge, but was told
by Small that ‘‘if you changed
the rule, I don’t think they'd
show up.”’

Before the SAB’s report, the
SEC heard a request from the
Students Association for Black
Unity. S.A.B.U. spokesman Ray
Magee asked the EC for $1,200
to help his group’s ball remain

free of charge. After considera-
tion, the EC agreed to give
S.A.B.U. only $750.

The EC agreed to give
S.A.B.U. the money out of its
funding account, which totals
$900. The EC decided not to
touch its reserve fund which has
a total, according to EC Vice
President Willie Mackie, of
more than $4,000.

Magee said that the band for
the ball will cost almost $1,500
and $850 would be needed from
the EC to partially pay for the
band. The rest of the $1,200
would be used, according to
Magee, for decorations.
Without the $1,200 total, he said
S.A.B.U. will likely be forced to
charge admission to the ball.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A Coming Together?

The subject of law school and undergraduate rela-
tions will likely become a major topic of discussion by
student leaders until the law school commencement
on May 24. While the relationship between the admit-
tedly separate student bodies has been evident for

some time, no one has really approached the situation.

in terms of dealing with a problem. It seems now that
the Executive Committee is going to discuss the rela-
tionship with the Student Bar Association as though it
is a problem. The EC’s main goal, articulated by
president Bob Willis, is reuniting the two schools into
one entity. We wonder if both the law school and the
undergraduate school should, or even want to be
molded into one entity.

One strong tie between the two schools is the group
of law students who were graduated from Washington
and Lee. Year in and year out this group produces
strong representatives such as former student body
president Beau Dudley and EC representative Jeff
Edwards. These two leaders have played a significant
role on the undergraduate campus as well as in Lewis
Hall. Law students are also active in the intramural
program and participate in major events such as the
Mock Convention and Contact. Yet even though there
are other ties between the schools, it seems there also
exist some formidable barriers which seperate the
two campuses. .

The most noticeable obstacle separating the schools
is the physical barrier. Few students wander across
the footbridge to Lewis Hall and seldom do many law
students make it over to the undergraduate campus.
The gap or division connected by the footbridge is
deeper and wider than it appears. There is also an age
difference which separates undergraduates and law
students. Inherent to the age difference are distinctly
different interests. Law students are generally more
mature, older and much more serious about their
studies. Another difference is scheduling. Law
students are deprived of full access to certain ser-
vices when undergraduates go on break.

A comprehensive list of similarities and differences
should be drawn up and studied. If the Executive
Committee is truly interested in the situation, it
should investigate it closely. We think closer ties be-
tween the schools could benefit both groups, but we
also think it absurd to try reconciliaton and strive for
unity if neither group is firmly committed to improv-
ing ties. In short, one can not legislate attitude; if the
law school and undergraduate campuses do not want
to function as one entity, efforts in that direction will
probably be futile. We urge the Executive Committee
to test the current before hopping in and being taken

for a ride.
The Vote

It’s funny the way things you discard or throw away
can boomerang back and hit you in the face. Many
students threw away their votes this week — in both
the Executive Committee and Interfraternity Council
elections — and the same students will likely be the
first people to gripe next year when the EC or IFC
makes a decision that the non-voter does not like. The
fact that only a third of the student body turned out for
elections is disturbing, but we will have a chance to
vote this spring. Each election does make a difference
whether you come in contact with our student govern-
ment or not.

 

Some Law Students Opposed To
Unification Of Undergrad, LawSchools

Dear Editor:

We at the law school have
observed with interest the
growing concern that there is a
lack of unity between the
undergraduates and the law
students. Bob Willis noted in the
Phi last week that the E.C. was
“trying to find ways to unite the
campus” and that unadvertised
law school parties were not
helping in that effort.

We do not attempt to speak
for all law students, but many of
us have no desire to unify the
two schools. There are very real
differences between the

  
   
    

/~ cA \
fara be
_ 5 tae

undergraduates and the law
students which preclude any
harmonious unification. These
differences include divergent
work and_ study habits,
dissimilar social interests, and
a law school student body
which, realistically, includes
women.

We respect the rights of the
undergraduate students to have
their traditions as incidents of
their undergraduate education.
The law students, however,
come from a wide variety of
backgrounds and colleges, and
many of us have been out of

school for several years. We
have already experienced those
types of traditions and have no
desire to relive them.

To address the issue of
unadvertised law school par-
ties, we fail to see how they
could be of paramount impor-
tance to anyone but law
students. If the E.C. and the
Trustees are really concerned
about unity of the two schools,
why not see that the law
students have equal access to
all the facilities of the universi-
ty. Law students pay the same
tuition as undergraduates, and
we should have the same oppor-
tunities to use the gym, the din-
ing hall, and the infirmary.
The hours for these facilities
are drastically cut during
undergraduate vacations, but
they are not affected at all by
law school vacations. Thus, law
students are deprived of equal
access.

In sum, the two schools
should not be forced into an un-
natural unity, but should in-
stead be allowed a separate and
equal co-existence. Again, we
stress that the views expressed
are those of the undersigned
alone.

Todd Ketcham

firemen arrived. Mattresses,
file cabinets and student’s per-
sonal belongings were stored in
the room.

One of the students who heard
the alarm and discovered the
fire, Dave Stevens, is a
volunteer fireman with the Lex-
ington Fire Department.
Stevens said that despite
repeated efforts by several peo-
ple to put out the fire with ex-
tinguishers, three boxsprings
and some boxes were already
on fire and flames were
spreading up the wall.

“We decided that it was too
much for us to handle,’ Stevens
said. “I told Gentner (Tom) to
get everyone out and I went to
the station.”’

About. 40 people were in the
house when the fire started but
had no trouble exiting. Firemen
did, however, have difficulty
getting the trucks close to the
back of the house. Cars lined the
driveway and parking lot, said
Lexington Fire Chief Bryan
Causey.

Causey said one fire truck
scraped against a car when the
truck was turning into the

“the blaze before

driveway. There was minor
damage to both vehicles, accor-
ding to Causey.

Stevens said that when he
returned with his equipment
and climbed to the third floor
with a hose, the fire was so hot
that it exploded flashlight bat-
teries in his back pocket.
Causey estimated that the fire
reached temperatures between
2,000 and 3,000 degrees
Fahrenheit, after it spread on
the ceiling and out a window.

Firemen were able to contain
it burned

roof, it would have been more
difficult to control and damage
would have been more exten-
Sive.

“If it hadn’t been for those
smoke detectors, we would pro-
bably still be here,’ Causey
said. ‘“‘Everyone ought to have
them.”’

Members of Phi Psi were not
only shocked by Sunday morn-
ing’s fire, but were also
dismayed that the fire started
in a room rarely used by
anyone. Although almost
anyone can go to the third floor

library, especially on weekend
nights, president Tony Ierardi
said practically no one even ©
goes into the storeroom where
the fire started.

‘We hardly ever let anybody
who isn’t in the house up there,
and very rarely are there peo-
ple in that room,” said Ierardi.

‘“‘Not many of us have really
comprehended it (the fire) yet
and as a result, there are a lot of
stories about how it happened
going around,”’ he added.

The fraternity agreed Mon-
day night to give $50 to the fire
department for their efforts.

Black Emphasis Month at
Washington and Lee University
is focusing this year on a topic
unique for a mostly white, all-
male college: ‘“‘Black Women in
the Eighties.”

W&L’s Student Association
for Black Unity (SABU) is
presenting a month-long series
of events emphasizing the
outlooks and accomplishments
of black women in American
ociety. Three of the five
scheduled presentations have
lready occurred, featuring
lack women professionals in
he fields of law, religion,
ducation and the arts.

The speakers, according to in-
formation released by SABU,
address a number of issues
“centering around the goals
and aspirations of the black
woman in the upcoming
decade.’’ All events are open to

Experiences
Maintenance ~

Difficulties

by Tom Baker
Despite operating in what

most students think is a suc-
cessful manner, the University

Library has run into problems
with book inventory and
maintenance since it opened 27
months ago.

Maurice Leach, the Head
Librarian, stated there is a
problem with students who in-
advertently or deliberately take
books from the library without
checking them out. It is easy for
students to walk out with books,
according to Leach, because the
university uses no guards at the
library’s main door. Leach also
said there is much concern at
this time of the year, mainly
because research materials are
in high demand.

Leach stressed the mutual
trust that exists between the
library staff and the student
body, According to Leach, the
library must maintain a “we
trust you and you have to trust
us’’ attitude if the valuable yet
fragile relationship between the
library staff and the student
body is to continue. Library of-
ficials do not want to discon-
tinue the honor system by using

EC Receives Petitions;
Four To Seek Reelection

by W. Cope Moyers

Four incumbents are among
the 24 candidates running for
positions on next year’s Ex-
ecutive Committee, according
to petitions filed at Monday
night’s EC meeting.

Junior Tripp Brower,
sophomores Frank Smith and
Peter Baumgaertner, and
freshman Ben Hale are all seek-
ing re-election to their positions
on the next Executive Commit-
tee, which will be headed by
junior EC member Eric Myers.
Myers was elected president of
the student body in last week’s
‘‘Big Three” elections.

Four other candidates are
running against Brower for the
two positions on the committee
from the senior class. They in-
clude Bob- Bergmann, Ken

Lang, Colt Puryear, and Jim

ers for a ground ball during Sunday's 17-10 victory over the :

For junior class EC represen-
tative, six students are seeking
to unseat committee members
Smith and Baumgaertner, in-
cluding Kraig Aramantrout,
SAB co-chairman Pryse Elam,
Danny Fetterman. Randall
Jacoby, Jack Sharman and
John Vlahoplus.

The position with the largest
number of candidates is

sophomore EC representative, .

where Hale and nine others are
running for the two positions.
Todd Barstow, Eric Campbell,
Zandy Campbell, Curtis Cowan,
Jack Dent, Louis Jehl, Ted Mc-
Quiston, Markham Pyle,
Leighton Stradtman and
George Weatherly are all can-
didates.

At the Monday meeting, the
EC agreed to limit candidate

Lax Team Wins Opener, 17-10

The Washington and Lee

lacrosse team opened its season

with a come-from-behind 17-10
win over the University of New

Hampshire this past Sunday,
March 15. The Generals will

travel to Raleigh, N.C., Satur-

day to face North Carolina
State. W&L is undefeated in its
six previous contests with the
Wolfpack, who sport a 2-1
season record.

“This season’s N.C. State
team is similar to previous ones
in that it has an explosive of-
fense and tremendous

stickhandlers,’’ begins ninth-

year W&L head coach Jack Em-
mer, whose team earned a 13-11

win over State last season in a
game played in Buena Vista,
Va. ‘‘They have good speed, a
good transition game, and ex-
ploit the unsettled situations
well.

“They do, however, give up
some goals, and if we can con-
trol the ball, we can get those
goals.”’

Scoring goals is exactly what
the Generals did during the se-
cond quarter against New
Hampshire. Specifically, W&L
got seven consecutive goals
over an eight-minute span to
turn a 6-4 UNH lead into an 11-6
advantage. Then, following a
Wildcat tally which made the

score 11-7 at halftime, the
Generals put the game out of
reach by scoring the first five

and only five goals fo the third —

period.

‘‘When we were down, we
talked about keeping our poise,
executing our offense,’’ Emmer
explained. ‘‘Then we wore them
down by scoring 12 of the
game’s 13 goals during the se-
cond and third periods.

‘‘T was pleased with our well-
balanced attack,’’ the coach
continued, pointing out that
twelve Generals scored in the
game. “With this many people
getting a hand in the scoring, it
makes us a tough team to

Each candidate is allowed 15

The committee also agreed
that candidates for sophomore
EC representative, class presi-
dent, and vice-president are
allowed to place posters only in
the freshman dorms and in
Evans Dining Hall.

Besides the 24 candidates for
the six EC positions, an addi-
tional 25 students are running
for various other class offices.

Four people have announced
their candidacy for senior class
president, including Jedd Dunn,
Scott Howell, Bill Leachman
and Doug Sheldon. With only
John Pakula running for senior
class vice-president of the

Bouton Explains Controversial Baseball Career

by Ralph Frasca
“The major league baseball
owners want to put a lid on
player salaries before the real
money comes in.”

The speaker was Jim Bouton,
former major league pitcher
and author of the controversial
best-seller, ‘‘Ball Four,’ ex-
pounding on the current conflict
between team owners and
players, which may result in a
baseball strike this year.

Bouton spoke at Washington
& Lee University Thursday
night, telling hilarious stories
which kept the audience
laughing before discussing the
rampant greed of owners,
player salaries and the virtual
deification of athletes.

One of his favorite subjects
during the evening regarded the
prospect of a Cable Television
deal, which, in Bouton’s view,
would provide hundreds of
millions of dollars in revenue
for baseball. Revenue which the
players invariably would de-
mand a large part of.

“The owners are trying to
prevent the players from hav-
ing access to that money. I don’t
believe that the owners or the
players are entitled to it. I
believe the fans should own the
teams,’ the adamant Bouton
argued.

Bouton’s plans?

‘At the next Mayor’s Conven-
tion, the mayors should go to
the Cable TV networks and of-
fer to field high-calibre profes-
sional teams that would soon be
major league in quality for
$10.00 per subscribed
home...fairly inexpensive for a
‘‘People’s League!”’

“There must be 5 million
homes that have Cable TV.

senior Mark McLaughlin, W&L sophomore Jody Harris, Bouton, W&L junior Jeff Haggerty and
Generals’ baseball coach Craig Jones.

‘That would be 50 million,

which is as much as baseball
makes from regular network
television right now.

“To form the league, just
sign minor league players, col-
lege players, and draft choices.
There would be no competition
with the major leagues,
because the owners would be
kicked out of the stadiums that
they don’t own. If George Stein-
brenner wants to run the
Yankees, make him build his
own stadium. Why should he
use a stadium that belongs to
the taxpayers?”

Bouton was not all business
though, as he told many
humorous stories about his
teammates. It was just such
storytelling in ‘“‘Ball Four’’ that
made him one of the most con-
troversial figures ever to wear
a baseball uniform.

“fT was in spring training
camp with the Yankees in 1962,
trying to make the team. We
were playing an_ exhibition
game against the Cardinals,
and went into extra innings. I
came in to pitch in the 10th in-
ning, and threw 5 scoreless inn-
ings. In the 15th, my catcher,
John Blanchard, came out to
the mound and said, ‘What the

hell are you doing, kid? It’s get-,

ting late! Just let them hit the
ball!’ I said, ‘‘John, I’m trying
to make the team!’ To which he
replied, ‘Look, kid, you’re not
going to make the team.
Besides, I’ve got to play golf,
and Yogi’s got plans for dinner.
Just let them win so we can get
out of here!’ The Cards finally
scored off me in the 16th inning
when Blanchard started telling
the hitters what pitch was com-
ing.”’

Bouton did make the team
that year, though, and spent the
next six years with the
Yankees, winning 21 games in
1963. He was dealt to the Seattle
Pilots in 1969, the season he kept
a diary which eventually
became ‘‘Ball Four.”

 

‘‘T have to thank the Baseball
Commissioner (Bowie Kuhn)
for the success of the book,”
Bouton chuckled. ‘‘He called it
‘a terrible book for America!’
Naturally, people had to read it
to find out what was so terrible.

The book sold 200,000 hardcover
editions and over three million
paperback copies. I wrote a se-
quel to Ball Four, called ‘I’m
Glad You Didn’t Take It Per-
sonally,’ and I dedicated it to
the Commissioner. I felt it was
thedeast I could do for him.”’

Bouton wrote ‘‘Ball Four” as
a protest to the endless stream
of ‘“‘milk and cookies’’ sports
books, which painted
unrealistic pictures of athletes,
virtually deifying them. He also
lashed out at the media for
making unworthy athletes seem

-heroic. Bouton’s example of

such a player was Thurman
Munson, who was eulogized by
all branches of the media after
his death in 1979, in a plane
crash.

Bouton stated, ‘“‘To make him
into a great man is a distortion.
Roberto Clemente is my idea of
a real hero. He, like Munson,
died in a plane crash, but
Clemente’s plane was headed
for Nicaragua with medical
supplies for the earthquake vic-
tims. Unlike Munson, he did not

Schenecker, and Bill Thau are

The EC discussed how it
might get enough students to
vote on the proposed amend-
ment change, which has failed
three times this year only
because the required number of
students did not vote.

The committee agreed to in-
clude the amendment on next
week’s ballots for the numerous
class offices, and also announc-
ed that although voting for class
officers will last one day,
balloting for the proposed
amendment will take place
through Wednesday.

At least half of the student
body must vote on the amend-
ment, as well as another that
would extend the tenure of of-
fice for EC members next year
from the day after
undergraduate commencement
to three weeks before.

This means that next year’s
Executive Committee will
assume its responsibilities dur-
ing the last three weeks of
spring term this year. EC presi-
dent Bob Willis said this amend-
ment is important, because it
makes the transition, especially
regarding spring honor trials,
easier for the next committee.

The EC also heard monthly
subcommittee reports from the
Ring-tum Phi and Cold Check.
The Phi reported that the cir-
culation problems have ap-
parently been resolved and that
it has about $6000 in remaining
funds for editions this year.

Mike Malesardi of the Cold
Check subcommittee reported
that the committee has about
$1500 in assets, and $282 was col-
lected from former students

The Maltese Falcon (1941) John Huston’s directorial debut, and
the first of many successful collaborations with Humphrey Bogart.
This is a first rate detective picture, from a novel by Dashiell Ham-
mett; done on a ‘“‘B’’-grade budget, it would open up a new world of
‘‘A”’ pictures for Bogart at Warner Brothers. Huston also wrote the
screenplay. Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Gladys
George and Ward Bond starred in the Hal Wallis production. To be

although not entirely faithful to the plot, adapted for the screen
with the help of William Faulkner. Screen debut of Lauren Bacall,
age 19, who made the celluloid sizzle with her opening line,
‘Anybody got a match?”’ (Must be seen to be appreciated). This
got Bogey and Baby off to a successful co-starring career, on and

Why Jim

by Ralph Frasca

After almost two months of
interviewing coaches, it feels
good to resume banging out my
commentary column.

I did enjoy writing the inter-
view series on _ coaches,
however, and in fact spent three
of my four high school years in-
terviewing professional
athletes for a Michigan-based
sports magazine. Much of my
free time was devoted to dodg-
ing chemical plants in my
native New Jersey, searching
for former and current athletes
to interview for my column in
the twice-monthly — sports
periodical. I did have the
privilege of interviewing some
of baseball’s true stars, such as
Hank Aaron, Willie Wilson, Phil
Rizzuto, and Bobby Thomson,
but I searched in vain for one of
my heroes. Oh, I knew. he lived
near me, but I could never track
down Jim Bouton. Until last
week.

Bouton appeared at Lee
Chapel Thursday, and proceed-
ed to captivate his audience by
telling some outrageous stories
of baseball lockerroom antics.
His appearance was easily the
most successful of those spon-
sored by Contact this year, but
for me, that fact was obscured
by my realization of a longstan-
ding goal: To interview Jim
Bouton.

Bouton is a jack-of-all-trades
in a very real sense. A 20-game
winner with the Yankees in
1963, Bouton has also added the
titles of author, sportscaster,
television scriptwriter, actor,
talk-show host, and mentor to
his repertoire. However,
doubtless his greatest claim to
cocktail-party fame was his
book ‘‘Ball Four,’’ which
chronicled his on and off-field
experiences during the 1969
baseball season, when Bouton,
a Yankee castoff, found himself
with a lowly expansion team
called the Seattle Pilots.

Although I have developed an
appreciation for such literary
superstars as Hawthorne, Poe,
and Twain since the first time I
read ‘‘Ball Four,” the latter has
remained one of my all-time
favorite “works of literature.”
Alternately hilarious and pro-

vocative, raunchy ana
philosophical, “‘Ball Four”
revolutionized sports book

writing by drying up the stream
of “milk and cookies’’ sports
books and biographies.

I’m sure you all know what
genre of book I mean.
Remember roaming through
your elementary school library,
devouring such pulp as ‘The
Tom Seaver Story’’? I sure did,
and I swallowed all _ that
malarkey which sought to
define athletes, making them
appear’ unrealistically

wholesome and_ righteous.
There they were, pre-
senting themselves in print
as that cozy, understanding

older brother that you never

had.

James Alan Bouton read
those stories too, but once he got
to the major leagues, he found
out that our baseball card
heroes did not drink malts, nor
did they go to bed at midnight.
Instead, they boozed and stayed
up all hours of the night, just
like the rest of us.

Bouton decided to write a
book in protest to the ‘‘milk-
and-cookies’”’ syndrome which
long afflicted sports book
writing. He wanted to take
athletes down from their
pedestal and place them,
deservedly, on a level with
everyone else. Somehow,
athletes had been thought of as
demi-gods, and still are to a
large extent. However,
Bouton’s book struck a blow to
the ‘“‘milk-and-cookie”’ monster
which encouraged people to
seek heroes from a group of
men and women who possessed
physical superiority, but rarely
mental or moral superiority.
Bouton revealed that they are,
by and large, ordinary people in
an extraordinary setting (ma-
jor league baseball), which
makes them do strange things.

Needless to say, “Ball Four”’
enjoyed remarkable success. It
spent eight months as the best-
selling book in America, selling
over 200,000 hard cover and
3,000,000 paperback copies.
Well, as any devout capitalist
will tell you, the safest way to

Sports

Bouton Wrote ‘Ball Four’

make money is to copy that
which is successful.

They arrived in hordes. The
‘‘reveal-all’’ books suddenly ap-
peared in alarming quantities,
choking off the “I’m a good
boy”’ biographies on the store
shelves. Professing to reveal
startling secrets and super-
raunchy stories, these sorry ex-
cuses for ‘‘candid’’ books
sought to imitate ‘‘Ball Four.”
One daring book, written by ex-
Detroit Tiger backstop Bill
Freehan, even dared to exceed
the. prototype. The cover of
Freehan’s book boldly pro-
claimed, ‘‘Knocks ‘Ball Four’
into leftfield.’”’ Bouton com-
mented that Freehan’s book
“‘didn’t even hit ‘Ball Four’ for
a short pop-up.”’

Thus, devoted literature
students, we have two extremes
of sports books: the patronizing
‘“‘milk-and-cookies’”’ sagas, and
the ‘‘reveal-all’’ expositions
which ‘‘tear the cover off of pro-
fessional sports.”’ Either way,
you have worthless, distorted
pulp, with “Ball Four”’ standing
above it all.

Having read it three times
and looking forward to a fourth
reading this summer, I would
recommend to the minority who
have not read the book to par-
take of it at the earliest possible
convenience, possibly once you
have won this round of the
“textbook war.’’ Although,
strangely enough, the W&L
library does not have the book,
area bookstores are sure to ac-
comodate.

Now if only I could interview

Generals Place Five

by Phil Murray
In every sport, college
athletes work all season for a
chance to test themselves in
competition against the best in
the nation. For college swim-
mers, that means the NCAA

~ Championships.

On March 19, five Washington
and Lee swimmers will travel
to Oberlin College in Oberlin,
Ohio for the NCAA Division III
Championships.

Junior co-captain Mike Ber-
not has qualified to compete in
three individual events — the
50-yard free-style (21.88), 100-
yard free-style (47.69), and 200-
yard free-style (1:45.74) And as
a part of the 400-yard free relay
team.

Bernot registered his qualify-
ing time in the 100-yard free-
style as the lead relay man for
the free relay team whose quali-
fying time of 3:15.91. The team
is composed of Bernot, junior
co-captain Herb Gresens, and
freshmen Jeff Gee and Gary

In NCAA Championship

Meyer. :

Coach Page Remillard
believes the team has a good
chance to make All-American,
but will have to swim a 3:13 or
3:14 to achieve that goal.

Freshman sensation Tim
Rock will also make the trip.
Rock has qualified in the 500-
yard free-style (4:47.64) and
1650-yard free-style (16:17.27)
events.

Rob Crawford, who broke
three school records at the UNC
— Wilmington Invitational,
qualified in those three events,
but chose not to compete.

Looking back on the season,
Coach Remillard was pleased
and optimistic for the future.
Several swimmers, including
Bernot, Gee, Meyer, and Rock,
had lifetime best times in their
specialty events.

‘“‘We found out how good we
could be this year,” said
Remillard. ‘Next year we will .
set higher goals and hope for
more success.”

Track Team Loses To Davidson

 

Billy Mooris and R.J. Skaggs in the 400-meter race.

by John Harrison

The W&L track and field
team lost a lead which it had
held for the majority of last
Saturday’s meet with Davidson,
and went on to drop an 89-80
decision. Mary Washington had
four entries, but failed to score.

M.W. did prove to be a factor
in the meet, nonetheless. The
Generals had a chance to come
out with a tie, but were denied
the opportunity because M.W.
had no one to compete in the
last event, the pole vault.
Because this was a tri-meet,
every team had to have at least
one participant in every event;
thus, the pole vault was cancell-
ed and the Generals lost their
opening meet.

Several Generals had strong
showings, most of which came
in the first half of the meet.
Freshman Kevin Kadesky plac-
ed second in both the 100 and
200-meter races; co-captains
R.J. Scaggs and Billy Morris
came in first in the 400-meter
and 200-meter respectively;

Charlie Alcorn placed second in
the discus and third in the shot
put; Alan Armitage finished
first in the intermediate
hurdles; Mark Shaver (159’8’’)
and Mike Fogarty (157’9’’) pac-
ed the Generals in the javelin;
freshman Paul Chapman was
second in the 800-meter; and
Russ Rector placed second in
the high jump.

Coach Norris Aldridge wasn’t
totally displeased with the
team’s effort, even though it
collected only two points in the —
last four events, while Davidson
captured 29 tallies.

The Generals will not par-
ticipate in the scheduled Rich-
mond relays on Saturday due to
cancellation. Coach Aldridge
believes his team would have
benefited from going up against
the scheduled field of strong
Division I schools.

The Generals’ next meet is on
Friday, March 27 at 3:00 p.m.
Emory and Henry and Newport
News will provide the opposi-
tion.
Tennis Team Splits 4 Matches

by Dale Park
Led by senior co-captains
Doug Gaker and Pete Lovell,
the Washington and Lee varsity
tennis team split 2-2 in its first
four outings of the 1981 spring
season.

The Generals opened up their
season back on March 8 with a

’ solid 6-3 win over the University
of Charleston, with W&L seeing
the top four singles flights.
Lovell, who earned All-America
honors last spring by advancing
to the semifinals of the NCAA

 
   

Division III Championships,
outlasted his first singles oppo-
nent, winning 6-3, 7-6 (5-3),
while Gaker cruised past his
man at the second flight, 6-3,
6-3. Sophomore Steve Denny, at
the third position, walloped his
oponent 6-0, 6-0, and freshman
Scott Berman went the distance

in his 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 victory at the
fourth spot.

In doubles, Lovell and Gaker
teamed up for a 6-2, 6-0 win at

the number-one flight, while
Berman teamed with classmate

Charles Kalocsay at the third
spot for a 7-5, 6-3 triumph.

On March 13, the netmen
made it two in a row by narrow-
ly beating West Chester State,
5-4. This time the Generals
swept the top three singles
flights, as Lovell, Gaker and
Denny won easily. In doubles,

Steve Denny and Wes Yonge teamed up to top West Chester State.

Lovell and Gaker swept to a 6-1,
6-1 victory, while Yonge and
Denny teamed up for a 7-5, 6-4
win at the second flight.

The following day, however,
W&L ran up. against a tough-
ened University of Rochester
team. The Generals managed to
win only one singles and one

doubles position as they bowed
to the Yellowjackets, 7-2. Gaker
squeezed out his victory at
second singles, 7-6 (5-4), 7-6
(5-3). Later, Gaker combined
with Lovell for an easy 6-3, 6-2
win at the first doubles position.

In their first ODAC match of
the year the Generals dropped a
close 5-4 decision to Lynchburg
on March 16. W&L took number
two and three singles positions;

“Gaker remained undefeated

with a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback vic-
tory, while Denny won a narrow
7-6 (5-0), 74 (5-2) match. In

PO Stacia

doubles, Gaker and Lovell ran
their record to 4-0 at first
doubles with a 6-3, 6-2 win, while
the team of Denny and Yonge
finished off their second-flight
opponents, 6-3, 7-5.

The W&L netmen will host
California State College tomor-
row at 2:00 p.m.

Golf Team Tops Rochester

final score of 420 to 436.

Led by junior co-captain Bill
Alfano and senior co-captain
Gerry Barousse, it appears
quite evidence that coach Buck
Leslie has put together a strong
team, one that can look forward
to a promising season. Leslie
stated that he was concerned

Lexington (703) 463-7222

(703)463-7222

 

about the class distribution of
players within the line-up, and
emphasized that good team
balance was essential if the
Generals were to have any
hopes of improving last year’s
mark. Obviously, Leslie’s
strategy paid off on Friday.
What: the squad hopes to strive
for now and during the course of
the season is the improvement
of their stroke average, and
this, most likely, will gradually
develop as the season pro-
gresses.

The team participated in a
two-day NCAA District III,
Division III tournament in
Greensboro, North Carolina
yesterday and today. The
Generals are competing with
ten other teams, most of which
are from North Carolina. Leslie
remarked that the tournament
“will help determine the
strength of the area’s Division
II] teams.’ Next Tuesday,
March 24, the Generals play
host to Bridgewater and
Shepherd Colleges.

Baseball Wins
First Three Games

The Washington and Lee
baseball team, which swept a
three-game series from West
Virginia Tech this past
weekend, will open its Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
schedule this weekend when the
Generals travel Friday after-
noon, March 20 to face defen-
ding ODAC champion Lynch-
burg College.

The conference encounters
will continue on Saturday,
March 21 when Emory & Henry
College visits W&L for a 1:00
p.m. doubleheader, and on
Tuesday, March 24 when the
Generals travel to Randolph-
Macon College for another
doubleheader. The ODAC ac-
tion is preceeded by a Wednes-
day, March 18 contest at
Longwood College.

“This week marks the begin-
ning of some true challenges for
our players,” begins head
coach Craig Jones, whose
Generals’ own a 3-0 record by
virtue of the wins over Tech.
“And we feel that we're
prepared for them, on account
of the tough teams we faced
during our pre-season Florida
trip and on account of the con-
fidence we gained this past
weekend.”

W&L’s wins came by scores
of 14-1 on Friday, March 13, and
14-0, 17-0 in a Saturday, March
14 doubleheader. Junior
righthander David Randall
pitched the distance in Friday’s
contest, striking out eleven and

allowing five hits, all singles.
Junior righthander Jim
Brockelman took the win in
Saturday’s opener, classmate
and righthander Rich Hachen-
burg the victory in the nightcap
by pitching a no-hitter. Both
Saturday games were short-
ened from the normal seven in-
nings to five due to abnormally
windy conditions on Smith
Field.

In addition to the trio of
righthanded pitchers, other
W&L standouts during the
series were: sophomore Chris
Cavalline,who had seven hits in
ten trips to the plate; junior Jeff
Haggerty, who belted a pair of
home runs and collected five
RBI’s in Saturday’s second
game; senior Tom Coates and
junior Tripp Brower, who ‘‘per-
formed extremely well at cat-
cher’ according to Jones;
sophomore Jody Harris, who
“is getting comfortable at
shortstop” after starting in left
field last season; and freshman
David Warrenfeltz, who
“provided good baserunning
and strong infield defense,’’ ac-
cording to the coach.

The five upcoming ODAC
games are part of 14 conference
encounters for W&L as the team
seeks a first-ever appearance in
the conference tournament,
which will involve the top four
teams from the eight-team
regular season standings. The
tournament is set for April 25-26
at Lynchburg College.

defense.”’

Five Generals scored two
goals each: seniors Geoff Brent
and George Santos; junior Mike
Schuler, whose tallies came
during the seven-goal run; and
sophomores John Tunney,
Geoff Wood. Junior Rob
Staugaitis handed out a game-
high four assists while
sophomore Craig Albanese,
who controlled 11 of 16 faceoffs
and scored once, received W&L
player-of-the-game honors.

Saturday’s contest with N.C.
State will be a meeting of the
ninth- and tenth-ranked teams
in the first U.S. Intercollegiate

Lacrosse: Association coaches’
poll, which was announced
Monday. W&L stood ninth, get-
ting 62 votes, N.C. State tenth
with 52 votes.

‘‘We like to think we’ve got a
(NCAA) Tournament team here
at W&L, a veteran team which
deserves more than _ ninth
place,’ Emmer commented.
‘We had a fine 3-0 exhibition
season including a key win over
Mt. Washington and we ended
up fifth in last season’s final
USILA poll. We like to think
we’ll be improving in the rank-
ings.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Black Emphasis Month

For those of you who have not noticed that the
Student Association for Black Unity is once again
sponsoring Black Emphasis month, we would like to
bring this fact to your attention. The topic for the
month dedicated to blacks is Black Women in the
eighties. While the topic may seem far-fetched or
unusual for this last bastion of southern manhood, we
think it is an excellent topic for two reasons:

One is that many Washington and Lee students
have little or no understanding of blacks. The other is
that we really have little understanding that women
play a more significant role in society than road trips
may tend to suggest. There is something each of us
can gain from Black Emphasis month, whether we
simply go to the ball or attend the various lectures.
The topic serves as a thoughtful reminder that in just
a few short years or even months we will be back out
in the real world.

E.C. Campaigns

It’s that time of the year again. The lacrosse
season has started, the weather has ranged anywhere
from sub-tropic to sub-arctic, and many
otherwise invisible and silent students have crawled
out of the wood-work to run for the E.C. Don’t get us
wrong, we have nothing against students who want to
join the E.C., we only doubt the validity of some can-
didates. For example, can any concerned voter cast
his ballot for a candidate who claims that his main
function as an E.C. member will be to do as little as
possible?

There are certainly many aspects of the W&L com-
munity which can be lampooned. However, the effec-
tiveness of student government should not be one of
them. In voting for your E.C. representative, you are
directly influencing the quality of life at this schoo!
We certainly believe that this is nothing to joke about.

IVCF To Participate In Hunger Day

Dear Student Body:

We of the W&L community
are privileged in many ways
that most of us tend to take for
granted. I am referring to the
blessings of health, family,
education, economic security,
and abundant food each day.
The availability of food is so
basic and expected that most of
us do not consider the extreme
world hunger situation. Accor-
ding to the 1980 Presidential
Commission on World Hunger,
20 million persons are dying
yearly of hunger-related causes
in the world. This means that
over 50,000 people have per-
ished today because of this pro-
blem, not the nice quick clean
way as on television, but over a
slow gradual starvation process
of suffering, agony, and pain
until death occurs. This is
something that we here at W&L
are not in a position to com-
prehend. Can anyone?

According to Dr. Harvey
Conn of Westminister
Theological Seminary, for
every 1000 people in the world,
69 of them live in North
America. Yet these 69 people
consume two-thirds of the
world’s energy, one-seventh of
the world’s food, and have nine-
tenths of the world’s doctors. I
am not going to show you a pic-
ture of starving men, women,
and children beside a picture of
what each of us consumes (and
wastes) daily in food intake. I
have simply superficially
described a problem ap-
proaching crisis that is
catastrophic, growing, and,
W&L gentlemen, is going to in-
fluence our well-planned and
“secure’’ futures.

Can something be done about
the millions of starving people
in poor countries before the
most unparalleled suffering in
human history menaces our
planet? The obvious answer is
yes. People die of starvation
one at a time, and they can be
helped one at a time. We, in-

dividually and corporately, can
be of significant aid to the solu-
tion of the world hunger crisis
as we take the necessary
measures to combat this pro-
blem.

We of the Washington and Lee
Inter-Varsity Christian
Fellowship have designated
Wednesday, March 25 as World
Hunger Day on our campus. We
are asking all students and pro-
fessors, who would be willing, to
voluntarily skip a meal on this
day and to donate the cost of
that meal to the cause of world
hunger. Any individual’s par-
ticipation in this project is pure-

~, = a

ed ek a vee “

PY eae er eh Ree ee ©

ly voluntary. We have selected
a newly formed local organiza-
tion, the Community Pantry,
which is a part of the Concerned
Citizens of Lexington, to donate
half of the proceeds to. We have
also selected an international
organization, World Vision In-
ternational, for this world-wide
scope and low administrative
costs (15 percent) to donate the
other half of the proceeds to.

Mr. Darrell of Evans Dining
Hall has volunteered to donate
the raw food cost for everyone
who will give up the evening
meal on this day. We are also
encouraging the law school to

participate. We would like to
give each of the fraternity
houses an opportunity to par-
ticipate in the same way as
Evans Dining Hall if they so
desire. For those persons who
eat in Evans Dining Hall and in
fraternity houses who do not
wish to skip a meal but would be
willing to donate money, we will
provide money cans in the
fraternity houses and ground
campus where permission is
granted.

This project has been given
approval by the _ Inter-
fraternity houses and around
campus where permission is

      
 

participate in some tangible
way.

We would like to encourage
everyone to participate on
Wednesday, March 25, but more
even than this, to seriously con-
sider developing a lifestyle that
confronts rather than ignores
the present world food crisis.
Again, your participation, while
greatly appreciated, is volun-
tary.

Sincerely,
Frank Williams 82;
President
Inter-Varsity
Fellowship

dollar toy.”’

Bouton was offered a job as a
sportscaster in New York, in
1970, and thus retired from
baseball. He spent six years as
a television sportscaster, where
his controversial mien got him
into more hot water. One of his
broadcasts was said to make
New York Giants’ head coach
Alex Webster, ‘‘look like a
dullard,’’ and the Giants took
Bouton’s employers to court.
Although the suit was eventual-
ly dismissed, Bouton was
branded a troublemaker, as he
had been when ‘‘Ball Four” was
published.

In 1978, the 39-year-old
Bouton attempted a major
league comeback ‘‘to find
myself,’ he reported. He, even-
tually pitched with the Atlanta
Braves after several trying
years in the minor leagues.

The personable Bouton still
looks as though he could hur! his
famous knuckle ball in the ma-
jor leagues, but he is occupied
with other things. He has just
written a new edition of ‘Ball
Four’, which includes a
chapter on what has become of
his old teammates.

He is also the inventor of ‘‘Big

made to look like tobacco.

Black Emphasis Month Plans

(continued from page 1)

“Of course Ruby Dee brought
out a cross section of the com-
munity,”’ he said. “‘We unders-
tand that these are educative
functions, and I don’t think suc-
cess is based on _ large

numerical turnouts. I’m fairly
optimistic that we’ll have a de-
cent turnout for the upcoming
events.”’

Scheduled to appear during
the rest of the month are
Vernese Oneal, director of ad-
missions at Dillard University
(and the only black woman who
holds such a position in the
United States) on March 26;
and the Rev. Leyontine Kelly of
Asbury United Methodist
Church in Richmond, Va.,
sometime in April.

The annual SABU- ball will be
held Friday, March 21, begin-
ning at 9 p.m., in Washington
and Lee’s Evans Dining Hall.
Entertainment will be provided
by the musical group Badwater.

Of all the scheduled speakers,
the one who has perhaps best
captured the black experience
with the written word is Mignon
Holland Anderson. Her stories
and articles have appeared in
the publications Black Books

municator. A collection of her

‘White America,”’ she wrote
in a letter to Dean White prior to
her lecture here, ‘‘has never ful-
ly accepted the responsibility
for conditions which exist
among the majority of Black
Americans. To a great degree,
white America thinks that it has
done good by us, that it has
tried, and that somehow,
despite failed efforts, it is now
time to pull back substantially
from those efforts.

simultaneously: One — to show,
demonstrate, how the ideas,

ongoing rage and bitterness
which Black people feel toward
whites; the aloofness with
which whites view Black
people.

and sweetness in Black people’s
lives, despite all that is life
threatening in that existence; to

shadowy form, the precept that

reconciliation and productive
partnership between white and
Black Americans is imperative
if we are to survive as a
nation.’

The substantial alseine’ vic- —

tory of Ronald Reagan, who
blacks voted overwhelmingly
against, has planted the seeds
of racial activism in this coun-
try largeiy absent during the
Carter administration. Any
black agenda for the 1980’s is
sure to include plans for over-
coming any obstacles the new
administration presents such as
its anti-busing stance and pro-
posed social program cuts.

Why, Dean White was asked,
was “‘black women”’ chosen as
a subject rather than another
topical aspect of black America
in the years ahead?

‘‘We examined the perspec-
tive of Washington and Lee as
an all-male institution,’ he
said. ‘‘We decided to give the
average student an opportunity
to look at the implications of
racism and sexism in society as
opposed to the more traditional
approach of racism in society.”’

Past speakers have included
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, come-
dian Dick Gregory and activist
Stoakley Carmichael.

Library Problems

(continued from page 1)
guards.

One library procedure that
has been criticized by students
is the refusal of the library staff
to disclose the name of a stu-
dent who has checked out a
book that another student
needs. Leach said this pro-
cedure exists in order to ensure
the privacy of the student who
checks out the book and to avoid
“putting one student against
another for a_book.’’ Two
weekends after the book has
been checked out however, the
library staff will ask the student
to return it if another student
has made a request.

Leach also expressed his con-
cern over several problems the
library has experienced con-
cerning smoking and the casual
use of emergency doors. Leach
said that students using these
doors jeopardize the safety and
security of the library.

Leach also pointed out that
several smoking
areas which were installed at
the request of students. Leach
also noted that continued use of
the emrgency doors may affect
the operating hours of the
library. The University Library
currently is open 24 hours a day.

In the area of maintenance,

4

many students have voiced
complaints over the elevators’
lack of reliability. Jim Arthur,
Superintendant of Building and
Grounds, attributed the prob-
lem in part to the constant
pushing of buttons, which he
credits to ‘“‘human nature.” Ar-
thur said the pushing of buttons
wears out the elevators’’ con-
tacts, causing them to “go
down.”

According to Arthur, the
library’s elevators take a long
time to repair because the
maintenance crew at W&L is
not trained to repair elevators.
Elevator contractors in
Roanoke would likely take the
same time to repair a downed
elevator, so Arthur prefers to
have the W&L do the job.

Arthur also added that the
library’s elevators employ a
new kind of technology, which
can cause problems. Arthur
also said the library's elevators
are the most-used on campus
and are therefore susceptible to
breaking down. Arthur claimed
the -library’s elevators cost
three times more than any
other elevator on campus to
operate. The library itself has
one of the highest operating
costs on campus, according to
Arthur.

Losses Bring End To W&L Record Store

by Eric Fife

After eight years of opera-
tion, the W&L Record Store,
located in the bottom half of the
book store, closed its doors as of
2 p.m. today.

The decision to close the store
was made during a meeting bet-
ween University Treasurer and
E. Stewart Epley and Bookstore
Manager Betty Munger.

Mrs. Munger said that closing
the store is the result of two pro-
blems which have been reoc-

‘ ,

 

curring over the past few years.
The Record Store has had
operating losses of several thou-
Sand dollars annualy and
managers seldom stayed on for
more than one year at a time.
According to Mrs. Munger,
the Record Store has lost ap-
proximtely $3,000 this academic
year. Epley said that the total
loss, which includes Social
Security, insurance, workmen’s
compensation and utility ex-
penses, will equal almost $6,000.

Washington and Lee University’s Student Association for Black Unity (SABU) held its annual ball
recently as one of the highlights of Black Emphasis Month which has brought several nationally promi-
nent speakers, including actress Ruby Dee, to the campus.

“The basic problem with the
Record Store,’’ said Epley, ‘‘is
the low sales volume.”’ Accor-
ding to Epley, the Record Store
cannot advertise in town
because other record mer-
chants would complain of being
undersold. This is due to the
fact that W&L’s record store
has small overhead costs.

Mrs. Munger said her biggest
problem with the Record Store
has been retaining managers
for more than a year. She

 

‘es ’ ‘q

 

 

 

claimed that she has trained
five seperate managers in the
last five years.

‘“‘No one makes this their
life’s work,’’ Mrs. Munger said.
This is a way station. Often the
managers are students who
want the chance to stay around
Rockbridge County for an extra
year.”

Record Store Manager Jeff
Badgett said that low pricing is
the store’s top priority. Badgett
says he buys $7.98 list albums
for $4.75 and sells them for $5.50
—a 75-cent profit. An $8.98 list
album costs $5.20 and sells for
$5.75 at the Book Store.

Badgett said the function of
the Record Store was to in-
troduce students to music that
they normally- would not come
across. ‘‘If one person comes
across classical music while
he’s here, then our purpose is
accomplished,’ said Badgett.
‘‘When the store closes,
students will be deprived of a
cultural resource.”

Student and faculty reaction
to the closing of the store is ap-
pearing in the form of petitions.
Mrs. Munger said that several
students had expressed their
disappointment in the store’s
closing.

According to Mrs. Munger,
the remaining inventory will be
sold at cost on Monday in the
main level of the Bookstore.

City Council Rejects Kappa Sigma Appeal

by Bill Whalen

An appeal by the Kappa
Sigma fraternity to receive a
special use permit for a new
chapter house-was unanimously
rejected last Thursday night by
the Lexington City Council.

Thursday night’s ruling
marked the second time in two
months the fraternity has been
denied a request to use the
house, which is located at 516
Main St. On January 28, Kappa
Sigma was turned down by the
Lexington Planning Commis-
sion.

“It’s not a vote against the
fraternities, it’s a vote for the
neighborhood,’”’ said Gerald
Nay. Councilman Larry Mann
also commented on the deci-
sion, stating that the vote was
one of ‘‘public welfare.”’

The hearing lasted over 45

minutes, yet it was a time in,

which deep faith and deep
mistrust of fraternity life were
expressed. Kappa Sigma
argued that the establishment
of the fraternity at 516 South
Main St is necessary for the
fraternity’s survival.

Several residents living near
the house argued vehemently
that the reestablishment of the
fraternity would be a danger to
the peace of the neighborhood.

Jim Gianniny, of 523 S. Main
St., presented a petition with
the names of 35 Lexington
residents opposed to the grant-
ing of a special use permit.
Gianniny claimed that under
Lexington city code, a condi-
tional use permit cannot be
granted if: (1) it affects the
health or safety of people living
in the neighborhood, (2) it is
detrimental to public welfare or
neighborhood property, (3) it is
in conflict with the city’s adopt-
ing comprehensive plan.

According to Gianniny, the
reestablishment of Kappa
Sigma would be a danger to
public welfare because:

(1) students who attend Lex-
ington High School would pass
by the house and might possibly
be affected by fraternity social
functions ;

(2) the noise level of the
neighborhood would be substan-
tially increased;

(3) the neighborhood has
changed since Kappa Sigma
moved out of the house in 1970.
The current residents have
more children, Gianniny
claims;

(4) the fraternity could not
improve traffic flow or safety;

SAC Adopts

by Steve Perry

Several weeks ago, Sigma Phi
Epsilon was charged with a
violation of section 15-33 of the
Lexington. penal code. If you
haven’t guessed by now, the
SPE’s were issued a summons
for a noise violation.

But while this charge is quite
common for fraternities, the
resulting sentence was not. The
SPE’s were given no social pro
bation and paid only a $10 fine.

A fraternity is charged with a
noise violation when its
amplified music can be heard
more than 50 feet away from the
point of origin. The complaint
may come from a neighbor, as
in the SPE case, or from the ar-

(5) litter from the fraternity
would be a hazard to the
neighborhood.

Defense of the permit request
was given by Bill Lemon, a
Kappa Sigma. Lemon also
noted that the acquisition of the

University
Improving
Security

by W. Cope Movers
Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Willis Monday night
released a letter from Dean of
Students Lewis G. John outlin-
ing recent steps taken by the
university to improve campus

security.
The letter, dated March 18
and sent to Willis, was in

response to numerous student
complaints and an Executive
Committee investigation into
problems with security for the
entire university community.

Among action taken by Presi-
dent Huntley and the university
administration is the hiring of
an additional security staff
member, planned installation of
new lighting around the univer-
sity, and a training session for
security personnel, according
to John’s letter.

The hiring of another security
person brings to three the
number now working at the
university. Two have now been
hired in the past year, accor-
ding to John’s letter, and work
with university proctor Bob
Murray patrolling student park-
ing lots, the fraternity houses,
and other areas of the campus.

In addition to the hiring of a
third security person, the
university has also made a
“complete survey”? of campus
lighting with plans to install
new pole lights on the Wilson
Field footbridge and on the foot-
path to Lewis Hall.

According to the letter, the
university is also working to en-
sure that there is adequate
lighting around the campus.

A training session for campus
security personnel was also
held with Lexington Police
Chief J.A. Kirby. John’s letter

resting officer.

After a fraternity has been
charged with a noise violation,
it is given a date to appear in
court. If the fraternity is found
guilty, it is given a mandatory
two weeks of social probation
by the IFC,

Sigma Phi Epsilon appeared
in court two weeks ago for its
misdemeanor. The SPE’s hoped
for dismissal on the grounds
that they had an excellent
record with the Lexington
Police Department.

In addition, SPE claimed that
it never received a warning
to turn down the music. Upon
hearing the case, the attending

judge issued SPE a minimal
fine of $10.

Although the fraternity was
given two weeks social proba-
tion by the IFC, the sentence
was later suspended by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. Again,
the reasoning was the SPE’s
record with the police depart-
ment,

tions,

CLS Spokesperson

Are there alternatives to
litigation? Should a lawyer ever
advise his or her olients not to
go to court? Is it a legitimate
part of a lawyer’s work to make
peace rather than fan the
flames of discontent? These are
among the questions which
Lynn Buzzard, Executive
Director of the Christian Legal
Society (CLS), will address in
his talk Thursday afternoon,
April 2, at Lewis Hall. The exact
time and location will be an-
nounced later.

Film Society Shows Bunuel

by Carren Osna Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will next show its first
Luis Bunuel film, the serio-
comic That Obscure Object of
Desire (Spain/France, 1977).
The movie will be screened on
Friday and Saturday, March 27
and 28, at 8 p.m. in classroom
‘**A”’ of Lewis Hall, free of
charge.

Bunuel’s long career in
movies has roots in his early
associations in Madrid with
Garcia Lorca, the Spanish poet
and playwright, and Salvador
Dali, the surrealist painter.
With Dali, Bunuel directed the
most famous avant-garde film
ever made, Un Chien Andalou
— (An Andalusian Dog)
(France, 1929). In its best-
known scene, Bunuel slits open
a woman’s eye with a razor in
order to shock the viewer into a

Student Art
Exhibit Opens

by Amory LeCuyer

The Fine Arts Department of
W&L will hold the annual stu-
dent art show exhibiting the
works completed in the first and
second semesters. The opening
of the exhibition will be Mon-
day, March 30 and will show
through April 17 in the DuPont
Gallery. A reception will be
held on April 3rd in the gallery,
from 5 p.m. to7 p.m.

The show will display the
works of students from Pro-
fessor Ju’s studio art and print
classes and Professor MclIlvain
drawing classes. Professor Ju
(artist-in-residence at W&L)
expresses that students are en-
couraged just to try. The result
is a wide variety of works in
several different medium and
styles.

The students showing will be
Frank Billingsley, Bill Comer,
Barry Eckert, Skip Epperson,
David Favrot, Randy George,
Kevin Kirky, G. Amory

new, uncensored level of
awareness.

Drawing on Freudian insights
into the unconscious,  sur-
realism thus confronts the spec-
tator with a world of illogic,
nightmare, fantasy, and forbid-
den images. The intention is to
dislocate the viewer, attacking
his position in an. artifically
stable, morally repressive
culture. Bunuel does this best
by combining surrealism with
social satire.

While Dali’s surrealist art has
become mired in repetitiveness
and a juvenile pursuit of the
bizarre and shocking, Bunuel’s
surrealist inclincations have
matured over the years in a
series of popular masterpieces.
These include  Viridiana
(Spain/Mexico, 1961), The Ex-
terminating Angel (Mexico,

1962), Belle de Jour (France,

In In Obscure Object of
Desire, Bunuel, as before, twits
society for the conventionaliz-
ing pieties which keep its life
safe, dishonest and boring. This
flamboyant movie focuses on a
man whose middle-class
moralism is tested by his con-
frontation with revolutionary
politics and an incendiary fan-
tasy woman.

————Film Notes

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1972) Pretty raw. A crude se-
quence of violent gore that has become something of a cult film,
with absolutely no artistry, social redemption or any of that stuff.
Probably the granddaddy of the current genre of mindless gut epics
(Terror Train, Fun House) now filling the screen, Guess the SAB
figured it would take something like this to really pull ‘em in, and
they're probably right. A light little entertainment to relieve the
pre-exam pressures. Friday through Sunday at 7 and 9 p.m. in du-
Pont Auditorium. Admission is $1.

Madame Rosa (France, 1977) Simone Signoret supposedly used
to make men melt, but it must have been many moons ago. In Ship
of Fools (1965) she looked awfully puffed up, and now she
resembles a bloated old cow. But she can act up a storm, and won
wide acclaim for her performance in this role as an obsolete whore
who takes care of the brothel’s bastards. Presented by the jour-
nalism department, Tuesday at 7 and 9 p.m. in Reid 203. Admission

‘La Traviata’ on WLUR

Giuseppe Verdi’s ‘‘La
Traviata’’ will be broadcast live
from the Metropolitan Opera
over WLUR-FM on Saturday,
March 28, at 1:30 p.m. The
Texaco-Metropolitan Opera
radio network broadcasts the
series,

James Levine, music director
of the Metropolitan Opera, will
conduct. Ileana Cotrubas,
singing this role for the first
time this season at the
Metropolitan, will be heard as
Violetta, Placido Domingo as
Alfredo, and Cornell MacNeil as
Germont.

As “La Traviata’’ is being
performed in this production in
three acts, there will be two in-

termissions. During the first,
Terrence McNally will present
a musical and dramatic
analysis of the opera. A special
‘Singers’ Roundtable’’ will be
featured during the second in-
termission with Zinka Milanov,
Bidu Sayao, and Rise Stevens.

This performance of ‘La
Traviata” is being presented in
the new production designed by
Tanya Mboiseiwitsch and
directed by Colin Graham,
which premiered earlier this
month. This matinee perfor-
mance will also be telecast live
to Europe and will be seen as
part of the ‘‘Live from the Met”’
series next season.

Commentary:

 

The NFL Draft

by Ralph Frasca

Having only recently
recovered from the Oakland
Raiders’ tidy, definitive, and
absolute pasting of the
Philadelphia Eagles (I,
sagacious bettor that I am, had
my moolah on those bastions of
Brotherly Love), it occurs to me
that frenzied football action has
not yet gone into estivation. On-
ly three weeks away looms the
NFL College Player Draft.

The New Orleans Saints, by
virtue of their incomparable in-
competence, their unflagging
flaccidity, not to mention their
malapropos mediocrity, have
earned the first draft choice.
They plan to draft former South
Carorlina Gamecock and
Heisman Trophy Winner
George Rogers, a running back
of generous skills, who no doubt
will demand an overwhelming-
ly generous contract. If the
Saints pick Rogers, can’t you
just see a wild horde of beer-
guzzling sports aficionados,
veritable denizens of the cheap
seats, forming a rowdy Rogers
rooting section? What would

they call themselves? You
guessed _ it Mr. Rogers’
Neighborhood.

The second choice belongs to
one of the most curious teams in
the league, the New York
Giants. Not only are they wholly
unable to name themselves pro-
perly (years of playing in the
Meadowlands is enough time
for even the Maras to realize
that the club plays in New
Jersey), but they have had vir-
tually no success with first-
round draft choices. Although
Phill Simms has_ performed
adequately thus far, Giants fans
still groan when such deadwood
as Rocky Thompson, John
Hicks, and Eldridge Small
come to mind. Yes, Wellington
Mara, they were No, 1 draft
choices, and you can't deny it.

The question of whom the
Giabts will victimi- oops, I
mean draft, is quite interesting.
Pitt's Hugh Green looms as a
choice plum, and will probably
be chosen should the Giants
decide to create trade bait. If
they draft for their own specific
needs, the Giants will overlook
Green, for the last place the
Giants need help is the defense,
the defensive line in particular.
No, better they should opt for an
offensive player. Although far
from stable, the line has fewer
woes than other offensive sta-
tions. With Ernest Gray, Jim-
my Perkins, and recent Lions
acquisition Mike Friede,
nicknamed “The Great White

Hope,”’ the receiving corps is
satisfactory. Phil Simms. is,
well, Phil Simms, and any fair-
haired youth from the torpid
confines of Moorhead State Col-
lege who has the requisite skills
to quarterback an NFL team
(albeit the Giants) for two
years deserves a third try. In-
cumbent kicker Joe Danelo's
skills, with the exception of the
first half of last season, are
rarely found lacking, and he
will be challenged by current
W&L baseball coach Craig
Jones. Tight end Jerry Shirk
will hang on to his spot for
another year, and no one will
take the punting job from Dave
Jennings.

If you've been keeping track,
you'd know that I left out one
position. The Giants need run-
ning backs.

Oh, how the Giants wish New
Orleans would somehow
overlook George Rogers! Oh,

‘how the Saints lick their chops

in gleeful anticipation of not on-
ly acquiring the agile Mr.
Rogers, but snubbing the Giants
as well! Where will this leave
the boys from the Meadow-
lands? Why, in the NFC East
cellar of course, just like last
year.

Undaunted, the Giants will
probably settle for running
back James Brooks, an Auburn
product, to complete a ‘‘book
end’’ backfield: two short,
squat, bowling ball backs (the
other being Billy Taylor). What
do you expect from a team that
plays in the wrong state?

The New York Jets have the
third pick. Despite their uncan-
ny ability to land top-notch col-
lege ‘‘names” (Richard Todd,
Marvin Powell, Lam Jones are
a few recent examples), they
can’t seem to win very often.
There is an excellent possibility
that the Jets will tab Hugh
Green, for the Jets’ top two
choices of two years ago, defen-
sive lineman Mark Gastineau
and Marty Lyons, have not
lived up to expectations.
Besides, Hugh Green is a
“name.”

Seattle Seahawk coach Jack
Patera will be looking for
defense in the college draft, and
may select UCLA safety Ken
Easely or Green’s defensive
line partner, Randy McMillian,
as NFL pick number four.

The only team who flopped as
drastically as the Jets last year
was the St. Louis Cards, picking
in the fifth spot. They should be
looking for quarterbacks to
replace the fading Jim Hart,
and will probably come up with
Purdue's Mark Herrmann. Neil

Netmen Suffer Three Losses

by Dale Park

It has been rough going so far
this season for the Washington
and Lee varsity tennis team and
head coach Gary Franke.

Last Friday, March 20, the
W&L netmen hosted NCAA
Division II California State Col-
lege and lost a close 5-4 deci-
sion. Singles winners for the
Generals included senior co-
captain Pete Lovell at first
singles and junior Wes Yonge at
the fourth flight. In doubles,
Lovell joined with classmate
and fellow co-captain Doug
Gaker for a 6-2, 6-0 victory at
first doubles, while Yonge com-
bined with sophomore Steve
Denny for a 6-0, 6-2 win at the
second flight.

California State proved to be
the easiest team that the W&L
netmen faced all weekend. The
next day the Generals traveled
to Davidson College, a Division
I school, and were gobbled up
9-0. Although no W&L player
really threatened in his match,
Franke explained that ‘“‘we beat
Davidson in a tough 5-4 match
last year at home. This year we
played them much earlier in the
season and also we had to play
them on their clay courts — and
we don’t get to play on clay.”’

March 22 found the Generals
at home again against another

W&L managed to grab the third

pressive 6-2, 6-3 win.

Each year W&L plays a tough

Lax Team Loses to Wolfpack

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team, which found
itself ‘‘doubled-up’’ in defeat
this past Saturday, will travel to
Towson, Md. on Saturday,
March 28 to face Towson State
University in hopes of earning a
tenth straight win over the
Tigers. The Generals will take a
1-1 record, the Tigers an 0-2
mark, into the 7:30 p.m. con-
test.

‘Towson State is always com-
petitive with us, which makes
for a great series,’ says W&L
head coach Jack Emmer of the
game, the 18th meeting in a
series which the Generals lead,
12-5. “This year’s contest will
be interesting not only due to
this competitiveness, but also
because we've got two teams
which suffered convincing

losses last weekend and which
would each like to turn things
around.”’

W&L will look to rebound
from a 20-10 setback at the
hands of North Carolina State in
a game which took place Satur-
day, March 21 in Raleigh.
Towson, meanwhile, will open
its home schedule with hopes of
erasing a 19-3 loss to North
Carolina, which took place
March 21 at Chapel Hill. The
Tiger’s other loss is a 15-9 ver-
dict to Loyola on March 18.

“Our main concern in the
game will be for our players to
concentrate on their perfor-
mances, and for them to have a
proper attitude for this and
future contests,’’ the Generals’
ninth-year director stated.

‘*A lot of good teams pick up a

 

 

Track Meet Cancelled

The Washington and Lee
track team was thwarted in at-
tempting to even its record at
the Richmond Relays last
Saturday. The meet was
cancelled.

According to coach Norris
Aldridge, the contractor who
was slated to resurface the

University of Richmond’s track
before the season fell behind
schedule, and informed the U of
R that the only possible time to
resurface the track was last
weekend. Otherwise, theschool
would have to wait until next
year. Hence, the cancellation of
the meet.

loss early in the season, but the
truly good teams can come
back from a loss and be on top
at the end of the season. We
hope our players will keep this
in mind.”

Against the Wolfpack, W&L
had comeback on its mind
before the hosts ran off eight
consecutive scores. The
Generals battled from a 7-3 first
quarter deficit to close within
one, 8-7, early in the third
period. At that point, however,
N.C, State ran off the eight
tallies to take command and
take its first win in seven tries
against W&L.

“‘We knew they were an ex-
plosive team, but we also knew
we could control this

characteristic by putting the

ball in the goal ourselves,’’ Em-
mer offered. ‘‘But they beat us
on the ground balls (71-53), ex-
ecuted well in unsettled situa-
tions, and did well in the
faceoffs. Once they got that
type of game going, they were
tough. Our comeback didn’t
give us all the momentum we
needed.”’

The W&L offensive efforts
were keyed by seniors, the most
notable of whom was mid-
fielder Geoff Brent with three
goals and three assists to earn
the team’s Player-of-the-Game
honor. Attackman Pere Roberts
added two goals, midfielders
George Santos and John Kemp
a goal and assist each.
Two W&L Students Spend Extra Time
As Coaches Of VMI’s Lacrosse Club

by Rick Swagler

Every weekday afternoon at
4, W&L Senior Biff Hearn pulls
up to the practice field behind
VMI’s stadium in his old Buick.

At the same time, Ben
Muskin, a W&L junior, walks
across the two campuses to the
same field. There, nestled be-
teen the back of the stadium
and some houses on a nearby
hill, they coach VMI’s lacrosse
club. Although Hearn and
Muskin are the same age as
many of the players, they have
little trouble getting respect.

This year the team will only
graduate four seniors Clarkson
Meredith, and captains Peter
Nauta, Bruce Gitchell and
Mark Spears. As Gitchell said:
“They’re good coaches but
there’s not the same discipline.
Everybody’s out here to have
fun. Biff and Ben are pretty
laid-back.”’

All three captains would like
for the team to go varsity, but
they are happy with its club
status.

Nauta stated that ‘a lot of
people get to play, we aren’t
under a lot of pressure to win
and we aren’t so restricted as
varsity. Everybody’s out here
to have fun and utilize their
talent. We like it the way itis.”

One player who wished to re-
main anonymous said that

‘‘nobody wants to go varsity.’’
-He continued: ‘‘If we were to go
varsity, there would be too
many regulations.”’

According to Captain Mark
Spears, ‘‘the administrators is
leaning toward giving us more
money, but they don’t want to
support us unless they do so
completely. We'll be pretty
respectable if we get the
money. We want to be able to
play W&L, U.Va. and Roanoke
College without being em-
barassed.”’

The team is very appreciative
of the time and effort Muskin
and Hearn are putting into the
club. Spears remarked that
‘‘they make a good team. Biff is
good with overall strategy
whereas Ben is good with the
technical aspect of the game.”’
Spears commented that the two
coaches are both calm and
level-headed at all times.

Biff Hearn played two years
of junior varsity lacrosse for
W&L, but, in his words, ‘‘was

‘never able to play varsity.”’ It

was at this time that Howard
Smith called him and asked
Hearn if he would like to be an
assistant lacrosse coach.

When asking why he coached,
Hearn said “‘its fun and rewar-
ding. I know that sounds like a
‘‘typical’’ answer but I’ve found
that it’s really true.’”’

Hearn says that VMI is being
more cooperative this year
compared to last in that the club
now has its own field. Hearn's
only negative comment about
the club was “‘its lack of depth.”

Ben Muskin also tried out for
W&L’s lacrosse team after hav-
ing a successful soccer season
but was one of Jack Emmer’s
early cuts. Muskin harbors no
ill feelings to Emmer, commen-
ting that “‘he’s an excellent
coach.’ There were other peo-
ple available who could give the
team more than I could.”’

Muskin is primarily an offen-
sive coach although he will pro-
bably be the head coach next
year if the team still has a club
status. Said Muskin: “‘It’s a lot
different on the other side of the
whistle, When you’re a player,
you can hide in a group if you're
not performing well. But as a
coach, you have to be at your
prime all of the time.”’

Although the club is just that
— a club — the players take
their sport seriously. Just as in
a varsity sport, tempers flare
occassionally. The team and the
coach are, however, on a first-
name basis, which seems to im-
prove cooperation.

And in their first game, which
was played Saturday, the team
defeated Ferrum.

Golfers Finish 13th In Tournament

by Scott Mason

Hampered by 82-mile-an-hour
winds and a driving rain, the
Washington and Lee golf team
could claim only a disappoint-
ing 13th place of 18 par-
ticipating colleges in a two-day
NCAA District III, Division III
tournament held in Greensboro,

es

 

 

rerry Barousse

North Carolina this past
weekend.

The Generals did not perform
as well as Coach Buck Leslie
would have liked. At the end of
the first day of the tournament,
the Generals finished in a tie for
fourteenth place. But with help

from ‘senior co-captain Gerry

  
   

Barousse, the team climbed
from fourteenth to tenth posi-
tion on the second day,
cumulatively resulting in the
13th place finish.

Despite the setback, Coach
Leslie is confident. However,
his main worry seems to be in
filling spots 4, 5, and 6 on the
team ladder, and it appears
now that Steve Everett, Jerry
Moyer, Tom Wohlfarth, Del
Agnew, Bruce Blythe, and
Steve Jones are all very much
in contention. The team’s worst
enemy at this point, says Coach
Leslie, is a ‘‘lack of concentra-
tion among the players.’’ Due to
academic pressures, along with
the fact that it is still early in
the season, the golfers seem
very unsettled. ‘‘With hard
work,’’ emphasises Leslie,
“team stability will come.”’

The Generals’ faced
Bridgewater and Shepherd col-
leges today at the Lexington
Country Club golf course. The
team’s next match takes place
on April 17 and 18, where they
will compete in the Virginia
Tech ‘Gobbler Classic.’’ We
can look for improved strides in
the Generals’ performance and
hopefully a season as equally
successful as their 13-3 record
of a year ago. As Coach Leslie
states, ‘‘It’s too early to put the
hammer down yet,” for the
Generals are very much alive
and kicking.

 

 

As the Washington and Lee
baseball team continues its Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
competition this week with a
Thursday, March 26, home
game and a Saturday, March
28, road doubleheader, head
coach Craig Jones will be look-
ing for an aggressive necessary
if the Generals are to appear in
the ODAC Championship Tour-
nament. W&L, which owns 5-4
overall and 2-3 conference
marks, is hoping for a first-ever
appearance in the Tournament,
which is set for April 25.

“We've got the talent, the
skill to be contenders for this
tournament,”’ Jones begins, *‘so
it will simply come down to
whether we've got the hunger,
the fight, and the agressiveness
to make it. We need a killer-
instinct type of attitude, no mat-
ter what the scoreboard may
show.”

W&L's Thursday conference
encounter is at 3 p.m. against
Bridgewater College. Satur-
day's trip is to Maryville Col-
lege. In addition, the Generals
will be hosts for two non-
conference games this week: a
3 p.m. contest on Wednesday,

March 25, against Lock Haven
State, and a 3 p.m. contest on
Monday, March 30 against Col-
gate University. Following the
Colgate game, W&L is off from
action until April 14.

In action last week, W&L
bowed to defending ODAC
champion Lynchburg 13-2 on
Friday, March 20 and split with
conference foe Emory & Henry
on Saturday, March 21, losing
the opener 13-3 and taking the
nightcap 11-8. Last Tuesday, the
Generals split a doubleheder
with ODAC rival Randolph-
Macon. The Generals won the

opener, 6-4. R-M_ took the
nightcap, 3-1.
According to Jones, top

Generals in the game were:
first-baseman Jeff Haggerty,
who collected his third home
run of the season in the E&H
doubleheader ; second-baseman
Chris Cavalline, the team’s
leading hitter with a_ .480
average; lefthanded-pitcher
Jim Halprin, who earned the
win against Emory & Henry;
and catcher Tripp Brower,
“who is giving us excellent
defensive play,’ says the
coach.

Bernot, Rock Honored

by Phil Murray

Junior Mike Bernot and
freshman Tim Rock attained
All-America honors last
weekend at the NCAA Division
III Swimming Championships
in Oberlin, Ohio.

Bernot, of Hampton, Va.,
became the second man in
Washington and Lee swimming
history to capture the honor in
three individual events. Rock,
of San Antonio, Texas, earned
his honor in one of the two
events in which he was entered.

Bernot set two W&L school
records and a career best on his
way to an outstanding perfor-
mance. He finished fourth in the
90-yard freestyle event with a
21.40. However, he set the new
record at 21.33 during the
preliminaries. In the 100-yard
free, Bernot placed third and
broke his own school record
with a 46.63 time. His career
best came in the 200-yard free,
in which he finished 10th in the
competition. His time of 1:44.09

was also good enough to tie the
existing school record.

Rock’s distinction came in the
1650-yard free in which he
placed fifth with a 16:17.27. He
also competed in the 500-yard
free.

The 400-yard relay team, the
only other General entrant,
rounded out the year with a
season-best time. The team of
Bernot, junior Herb Gresens,
and freshmen Jeff Gee and
Gary Meyer turned in a 3:13.98
to finish 15th in the competition.

Obviously happy with the per-
formance, Coach Page
Remillard saw the Champion-
ships as a sign of continuing im-
provement in the W&L aquatic
program.

‘This sort of national recogni-
tion draws fine student-athletes
to W&L,”’ he said. “I think this
is a real indication of how well
we can do in dual meet competi-
tion next year.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Hitting a Low Note

The Washington and Lee Record Store, located in
the basement of the book store, officially closed as of
2:00 p.m. today. University Treasurer E. Stewart
Epley Bookstore Manager Betty Munger made their
decision to close the store for two reasons: the store
was losing money and store managers seldom stayed
around for more than a year or two. Yet only a few
hours after the closing announcement was made, pe-
tions to reconsider the decision were posted around
the campus. Only a few hours after the petitions ap-
peared on campus, they had several hundred
signatures. Signatures in the early stages were
balanced with faculty members and students both ac-
tively supporting keeping the record store open.

The petition, directed to President Huntley (see ‘‘A
Request For President Huntley”’ on this page), makes
several good points, but the bottom line of the petition
and thrust of the argument are the same; a record
store with a variety of material is an important con-
tribution to the liberal education. The record store
may lose money, but this is a university for learning,
not a corporation out to make a profit every year. We
agree with the petition and believe that the Record
Store should not be closed. Nearly any alternative to
closing the store would be better tor the university
than depriving its students, faculty, administrators
and other employees of this important service.
Washington and Lee should support the Record Store
for the same reasons it supports other organizations
which habitually lose money while providing an in-
valuable service.

If the location of the record store is a problem,
move it to the basement of the Student Center. The
former music room is a large area in the Student
Center which is not being used. Many schools have a
book exchange run by the students. Is there any
reason Washington and Lee could not try a record
store managed and manned by students? Students on
the work-study program could be used to run the
operation or the project could be handled as a
seperate job. Perhaps a combination record
store/book exchange would work. We think that any
alternative to the present situation of no store at all
will represent an improvement. We urge President
Huntley to reconsider the decision to close the
Bookstore.

The Security Report

Having complained of security deficiences for the
majority of this year, it comes as a relief to see that
the university has taken affirmative steps in trying to
solve this campus’s safety problems. The recent let-
ter sent from Dean of Students Lewis John to E.C
President Bob Willis is a reassurance that the ad-
ministration is indeed aware of the problem and
wants to end it.

We can only hope that this is the first of many such
measures to come. By adding members to its security
staff and improving lighting around campus, the
university is making the campus safer for all of us.
That is one idea no one can disagree with.

must buy our stock. Their ser-

ferent, at best.

Too, the Bookstore has had an
increasingly difficult time
finding staff who can make a
real commitment to the opera-
tion.

These various problems have
led toward only one ending: —
the closing of the record depart-
ment, as of March 30th.

Our appreciation goes to the
band of faithful customers who
kept us on our toes, musically.

tion to that education.

The record store is the only
place in Lexington where facul-
ty, students and townspeople
can purchase recordings of
classical and other fine music
at affordable prices. The clos-
ing of the store would effective-
ly deny the community the op-
portunity to explore and pur-
chase anything other than cur-
rent hits.

We believe the university
should support the record store
in the same way and for the
same reasons that it supports
the book store, the glee club, the
theatre, the speakers’ bureau
and similar organizations. If
the university is, nevertheless,
unable to accept the small an-
nual deficit accumulated by the
store, we request that rather
than close the store, the univer-
sity consider ways to improve
its operation.

We will be happy to meet with
you to discuss our request with
you in greater detail.

Respectfully submitted,

SABU’s
Program
Lauded

Dear Editor:

Last Wednesday night in Lee
Chapel, Mrs. Mignon Holland
Anderson read and discussed
one of her works of fiction as
part of the SABU-sponsored
Black Emphasis Month ac-
tivities.

As one member of the very
small crowd (of 20 or less) in at-
tendance at what amounted to
an impressive and moving
dramatic reading, I have to say
it’s a real shame that the crowd
wasn’t a whole lot larger. Mrs.
Anderson’s views on the effects
of racism in black-white rela-
tions deserved to reach a wider
audience.

SABU has my admiration for
arranging a notable series of
events focusing on subjects too
rarely considered in the W&L
environment.

Sincerely,
Will Jackson ’83
 

| Group Plans May
Anti-War Rally

To the Editor:

The People’s Anti-War
Mobilization (PAM), a broad
coalition of hundreds _ of!
organizations and individuals:
across the country as well as
other anti-war and progressive
groups have joined forces to
call for a massive demonstra-
tion on the Pentagon on May
3rd. The activity will protest the
U.S. war build-up, the increased
U.S. intervention in El
Salvador, and the wide budget
cuts by the Reagan administra-
tion.

Campuses nationwide have
been one of the largest
mobilizers for the May 3rd ac-
tivity. Student Coordinator Ray
Nandar, stated, ‘“‘The response
of the campuses’and students
has been phenomenal.”’ Student
government and other campus
organizations at schools like
Norfolk State, Fisk in Ten-
nessee, in Madison, Wisc., in
Boston and Amherst Mass., and
the University Senate of CUNY
(which covers over 170,000
students) have seen the impor-
tance of this march and have
actively begun building for it. It
can be the largest national
march in a decade.

“Students,” Ray continued,
“‘see that the money that is be-
ing taken from education and
social services is being used to
buy bullets to kill the people of
El Salvador. We will not stand
for it.”

Numerous press conferences
have been held across the coun-

 

try; coverage has been seen in
Atlanta, New Jersey; Norfolk,
Chicago, New York and other
cities.

PAM has available materials,
speakers, and is available for
interviews. Funds are also
urgently needed. Please call
(202) 462-1488 or (212) 741-0633.

The National Third World
Students Coalition of USSA also
will be holding a Third World
student conference in
Washington, D.C. on Saturday,
May 2nd.

The Great Gymnasium Cockroach Olympics

If I were a cockroach, I think Lexington would be a grand place to
live. And of all the plush hatching grounds that cater to roaches,
none would be more deliciously inviting than Washington and Lee’s
Doremus gymnasium. The accomodations would be perfect.

Just imagine the possibility of the annual Cockroach Olympics.
There would be a series of events to test the endurance, cunning,
and dexterity of the world’s most prolific creatures. The first event
would be the Dust Skating Roachathon, where we would don our lit-
tle roach skates and with a certain abandon and cockrobatic grace,
glide over the ancient film of dust and grease — through the rac-
quetball courts, up the walls, and up the stairs. The first million
roaches to reach the men’s lockerroom would compete in the next
event, while the losers could feast on the scrumptious mountains of
spittle that garnish the halls.

Strengthened by the powerful odors that pervade the lockerroom,
the roaches are now ready for the great Cockswim. The object here
is to splash enough water out of the stagnant pools in the shower
stalls so that the roaches can eat the hair that stops up the drains.
Washington and Lee gentlemen have truly delicious locks, but
nothing can compare to the fine flavor of hair that has molded in
drains for years and years.

After the Cockswim, comes the Fungi-Lick. For those who sur-
vived the great whirlpool (resulting from the sanitary drainage
system), the Fungi-Lick is one of cocksport’s greatest games. Dex-
terity of the tongue is the key to cleaning the bathroom floors of
Athlete’s Foot fungi (not to mention jock itch). But since the
bathrooms haven’t been cleaned in years, the roaches would have
to take time out and pump some iron. Welcome to the great
Cockpump Contest! And as you might have guessed, this is basical-
ly the most invigorating form of reproduction available to.roaches.
At any rate, strengthened in number and body, the roaches now
have no problem lapping up the tasty fungi that seem to carpet the
lockerroom tiles.

Yes, I would love to be a cockroach. I could feel as though J had
done my civic duty: the gym would be clean! After all, with
cockroaches, who needs janitors? But this is not the point; indeed I
neglected to inform you of the last event in the Cockroach Olym-
pics. After eating with such rabid abandon, cockroaches do, indeed
excrete, The roaches would march, en masse, to the fourth floor of
fices and leave their heroic droppings on the desk of your favorit
administrator.

Onp SMITH The Ring-tum Phi, March 26, 1981, Page 7

 

Dear Editor:

In the March 19, 1981 issue of
the Ring-tum Phi you included
an editorial titled ‘“E.C. Cam-
paigns.”’ I have the following
complaints:

1. The editorial concerned my
campaign only.

2. I was taken out of context.
The editorial stated only one
sentence from my poster, and
that sentence didn’t put across
the idea behind my campaign.

3. I was given no time for a

Editorial

Was Irresponsible

reply. The item was printed on when it is based on a series of

the Thursday before the elec-
tion, and any reply could only
be printed on the Thursday
following the election.

4. In the editorial, my cam-
paign is dismissed as a joke.
Strangely enough, my cam-
paign was one of two which, as
far as I can tell, actually stated
what the candidate would do
once in office. How can any
campaign be called serious

eye-catching yet meaningless
posters?

In conclusion, I can only state
that whoever wrote the article
must not have thought out the
editorial before submitting it.
The fact that you, as editor-in-
chief, didn’t examine it more
closely is a reasonable cause to
cite irresponsibility on your
part.

Yours truly,
Ralph Dosser

 

The editorial opinion of the Ring-tum Phi is generally agreed
upon by a group of senior staff members. Our final opinion is exact-
ly that, an opinion. The editorial which has incensed Messrs.
Dosser and Vaughan sought to address a problem we saw and still
see as Salient; you really cannot joke around when it comes down to
administering the honor system and handing out student body
funds. We simply picked out Dosser’s poster claim that if elected,
he would try to do as little as possible as an example for out point.
As for Chip Vaughan’s charge that Todd Smith’s cartoon lampoon-
ed Ralph Dosser’s campaign, we can only say that if one reads the
cartoon they will notice that Smith's candidate is running for re-
election. Ralph Dosser was not running for re-election.

furiated by your ‘‘paper’’, as

straw that broke this camel’s
back. For you to criticize one of
the E.C. candidates’ campaign
gimmicks just before the elec-
tion proves, at least to me, just
how unprofessional and tactless
you are. You showed your
readers, by this act, that you
are definitely not unbiased

readers with an impartial view
of the election and the can-
didates but rather you showed

nable propogandists.Surely you
must have realized that your
editorial could adversely affect
Mr. Dosser’s campaign! If not,
how then, did you get into this
university with such an obvious
lack of intelligence and com-
mon sense? I may not agree
with Mr. Dosser’s political
philosophy but I do believe that
his campaign, and whatever
campaign slant he chooses to
use, should be given as fair a

shake as all the other cam-
paigns and their particular gim-

micks. Further, I found Mr.
Smith’s cartoon equally as

that the cartoon was aimed

specifically against Mr. Dosser

and his campaign. Mr. Smith

must either be your pawn or

your equal. I have found that

the candidates and their cam-

paigns for this upcoming elec-

tion, including Mr. Dosser’s,

have been particularly in-

teresting in their variety and

enthusiasm and none of them

deserve the lampooning you

gave Mr. Dosser’s. I can tell |
you this; you have lost at least |

Kappa Sigma Denied Special Use

house is vital to the survival of
the fraternity.

“TI don’t know if we were
outstanding neighbors, but I do
know that we didn’t receive any
complaints,’’ said Lemon, who
was at one time a_ house
manager for the fraternity. “I
think these boys share the same
interest.”

Lemon mentioned that he as a
participant in a group that
would finance the purchase of
the house. Called Mu House
Corporation, the backers in-
clude Lemon and Dr. Frederick
Fedderman. If the permit is ob-
tained, said Lemon, the group
will receive a $65,000 long-term
loan from the university to
remodel the property and refur-
bish the house.

Lemon said that under the ar-
rangement, the Kappa Sigmas
would be watched by a house
mother. Lemon also said that he
was impressed by the current
members of the fraternity.

Other support for the fraterni-
ty was given by Bruce Myers a
law student at W&L. “We have
looked through Lexington high-
and-low,”’ said Myers. “If you
say ‘no’ to a fraternity at 516
Main St., then what’s implied is
‘no’ to a fraternity in any
residential district.”

Mrs. Charles Friedman, who
has lived in the house for the
past eight years, said that she is

dolph, did speak in favor of the
permit. ‘‘With fraternities, you
get the type of neighbors you
yourself are,’’ said Mrs. Ran-
dolph.

After this point, however, the
statements began to go against
the Kappa Sigmas’ bid. One
such critic was G.P. Whiteley, a
member of the neighborhood.
Whiteley’s criticism was
‘‘because of parties, because of
the record of other fraternities,
because of the possibility that
this area would become
blighted.’’ There is the chance
that other fraternities might
move to nice areas,’ said
Whiteley.

“It wasn’t quite as nice and
quiet as it really was,’ con-
tinued Whiteley. ‘I’m sorry for
the owner, but I’m afraid that if
this happens, the community
will change and we will not be
able to sell our home.”’

‘Fraternities in Lexington
have a long history of abuse
against their own property,”’
said Adams. “‘I see no reason to
have another place where they
can literally destroy at will the
responsible few who cannot con-
trol the mob.”

Adams claimed that on party
weekends, ‘‘with crowds of 150,
broken windows, broken _bot-
tles, fraternity behavior in this
town has been reprehensible
and offensive.”’ ‘‘Why should we
be subjected to another frater-
nity,” asked Adams.

Adams then gave a recent ex-
ample, in which, he claimed,
“the fraternity by the post of-
fice literally covered the street
in broken glass.”’ Adams said
he rode across the street at 8:15
a.m. and called the police two
hours later. Adams said that the
police forced some fraternity
members to clean up the glass.

“I said: “Did you charge
them?’’ and the police said:
‘‘No, not this time.’’ “‘Well, how
many times do you have to do it
before you get charged?”

Adams claimed that bottles
were thrown from 516 Main St.
in 1970 and, in 1968, a football
was kicked through every win-
dow of the house.

“Fraternity behavior is
reprehensible, offensive and
cannot be tolerated,” continued
Adams. ‘I thought Washington
and Lee was going to exert
more control over fraternities
this year. Apparently, they
have not.”’

‘Sentimental reasons will not
suffice for putting them back in

that house. Housing shortages
will not suffice. The zoning laws
will not suffice. What matters
here is what’s right and what’s
wrong.’

Thursday’s decision
represents the second of three
possible steps Kappa Sigma can
take to obtain a special use per-
mit. The only option now left to
the fraternity is an appeal to a
circuit court.

In order to overturn City
Council’s decision, Kappa
Sigma would have to prove that
the Council’s decision was, in
some way, discriminating. A
spokesman for the fraternity
said that his group has not yet
made any plans for an appeal.

 

EC

(continued from page 1)
said that cooperation and com-
munication with the Lexington
Police Department were em-

At Monday night’s EC
meeting, the committee also ap-
proved a motion giving the In-
ternational Club $75 for
organizational purposes.

The club, organized about two
months ago, is one of several in
the area. The club’s primary
purpose, according to president
Francisco Guzman, is to orien-

tate foreign students who come
to the university on American
culture and the Rockbridge
County area.

“The needs of foreign
students is much different than
those of American freshmen,
and it’s quite difficult for them
to learn about American
culture,’’ said Guzman.

In other business, Willis an-
nounced that petitions for the
April 1 EC election are due next
Monday.

Election Procedures Criticized

by W. Cope Moyers

Led by defeated sophomore
incumbent Pete Baumgaertner,
the Executive Committee Mon-
day night strongly criticized
procedures governing last
week’s student body elections.

Baumgaertner, who lost his
seat on the committee to John
Vilahoplus and incumbent
Frank Smith, expressed
dissatisfaction that polls were
not manned, election publicity
was unsatisfactory, campaign
violations were committed and
confusion was prevalent during
the general election and Thurs-
day runoffs.

Baumgaertner suggested that

the Executive Committee in-
vestigate ways in which elec-
tion procedures might be im-
proved in the future and agreed
to form an ad-hoc committee
with EC law representative Jeff
Edwards, the Voting Regula-
tions Board and_ several
members of the student body.

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Willis agreed with
Baumgaertner, saying that the
elections ‘‘just weren’t run
right.’’ He also reminded the
committee that efforts in the
past to correct similar pro-
blems have not had impressive
results.

Two members of the commit-

Posters Attempt

To ‘Dump Smith’

by Todd Smith

“Dump Smith” read posters
placed extensively across the
main campus after dark on
Tuesday of last week.
Sophomore Executive Commit-
tee Representative Frank
Smith had just qualified for the
Thursday run-off for the two
Junior E C_ positions.

Smith was later reelected,
gathering 81 votes (more than
any of his opponents). The
posters were almost completely
removed by mid-Thursday. ‘‘I
took down four or five before I
realized I had no right to in-
terfere with someone else’s free
expression,” said Smith.

According to the anonymous
posters, it was ‘‘obvious”’ that
the sophomore class had the
‘poorest representatives.”’ The
University Printing Center pro-
duced 150 of the posters on
Tuesday afternoon.

The Printing Center called
EC Vice-President Willie
Mackie for advice on whether to

print the posters. Mackie
recommended the printing on
the basis that the EC had no
power of prior constraint
against free expression. ‘‘I told
the center to go ahead unless
the posters violated some norm
of taste,’’ said Mackie. He
reasoned that the posters could
be hand-made, anyway.

Frank ‘Smith said he received
an anonymous phone call at
3:45 a.m. on Wednesday morn-
ing warning him that the
posters had gone up.

“T have reason to believe,”’
said Mackie, “‘that the people
who put up the posters were ac-
ting in response to exaggera-

tions and misleading
statements on Frank Smith’s
posters.”

One of the unsigned posters
said ‘Smith Stinks” and asked
what he had ever done, and
what idea he ever had. Smith’s
poster had claimed that he
“was at work to change the

(See CAMPAIGN, page 2)

tee, junior Eric Myers and
senior Jim Vines, were
especially critical of the elec-
tions. Myers complained that
there were more campaign
rules violations this year than
ever before.

Vines told the committee of
an incident involving a
freshman candidate who lost
the election by less than ten
votes.

Vines said that the voting sta-
tion located in the freshman
quad, ‘‘one of the most strategic
polls as far as this candidate
was concerned,’’ actually ran
out of ballots in the afternoon.

But Voting Regulations Board
chairman Mike Drinkwater
defended the error, saying that
during the 30 minutes no ballots
were available, he told students
of other polling places. And
Drinkwater also said that only
one student showed up during
this time to vote.

Most committee members
were sympathetic to the main
problem encountered by the
VRB, which suffers from a
severe shortage of students
willing to watch the polling
places during the elections.

‘“‘We’ve been trying to recruit
people all year, but most just
think it’s a joke,’”’ Drinkwater
said.

Drinkwater also said that the
reason polls were not manned
all day during Thursday’s
runoff was due to the Phi Beta
Kappa ceremony, which altered
the usual class schedule.

In other business, Vines
reported on possible White Book
changes being considred by an
EC subcommittee.

Vines said that his subcom-
mittee will make its report to
the full committee on April 27,
at which time the EC will begin
discussion on whether to accept
the proposals.

W&L Beats Delaware,
Ends Losing Streak

by Rick Swagler

After dropping two games in
a row, one to North Carolina
State and another to Towson
State College, the Generals took
to Wilson Field yesterday and
beat the Delaware Blue Hens.
Going into the contest, the blue
cluckers were ranked number
thirteen in the national poll.

The Generals drew first blood
when Mike Schuler dashed
downfield and fired a quick,
shot. Both teams traded goals
throughout the game with
neither taking a decisive advan-
tage.

The fourth quarter proved to
be very fruitful for W&L as the
Generals scored four
unanswered goals before allow-
ing a Delaware goal with 4:42
remaining.

The final score did not reflect
the closeness of the game. Geoff
Brent commented that after
losses to Towson State and
North Carolina State, the
team’s “confidence had been
shaken,” and that the team
“thad doubts’’ about its ability to

come back. ‘‘I didn’t think we
should havelost the N.C. State
game, and it took us the Towson
game to get the ‘‘feel’’ back. It
paid off today though.”’

Senior midfielder George
Santos agreed with Brent, say-
ing, “The team is definitely
back of track, W&L is notorious
for coming back.’’ Santos con-
tinued, ‘‘A total team effort like
today’s helps you realize that if
the ball rolls by the goalie, it's
not necessarily all his fault."

Coach Jack Emmer was
“real happy”’ about the victory,
saying ‘‘we’ll take a win any
way we can get it.”” Emmer
echoed Brent’s sentiments say-
ing that the two losses shook the
team.

Emmer said he is looking for-
ward to the William and Mary
Contest of April 14 as a ‘‘con-
fidence builder,”’ adding ‘‘we
scheduled the game there for
that reason.”

Emmer emphasized the need
for fan support on the April 19
game against arch-enemy
University of Virginia.

 

by W. Cope Moyers

Mumblings of criticism and
expressions of disgust are
already circulating among
many of us who believe that
television’s coverage of Mon-
day afternoon’s incident in
Washington was distasteful, ir-
responsible and inaccurate. It
seems that each and every time
the television press informs the
public on important and often
fast-breaking news stories,
many are more interested in at-
tacking television instead of
praising it.

In the coming months,
\ Americans are going to be inun-

 

dated with scorecards and criti-
ques, debate and forums on how
well or poorly Dan Rather,
Frank Reynolds, Edwin
Newman and Roger Mudd took
control of the situation and fed
the public the fast breaking
story, one of the most important
events in American history in
the last 20 years. But before
jumping on the anti-news band-
wagon, there are a few aspects
of the drama the public should
bear in mind.

First, within nine minutes of
the shooting, ABC was interrup-
ting its regular programming to
inform its viewers that there

assassination. CBS followed
three minutes later, NBC 60
seconds after that. By 3 p.m., a
large percengtage of
Americans, those with the
largest stake in an event of such
magnitude, knew that
something significant and ex-
plosive had occurred involv-
ing the American government.
Thanks to the three networks,
the news was out and reaching
millions of Americans im-
mediately. Yet the critics will

Monday’s Coverage

conveniently forget this.
Second, although initial
reports said the President had
not been injured, this was not
the fault of the media. Such con-
fusion was not limited to the
networks, but prevailed at the
White House, which was caught
off-guard by the shooting and
initially was unprepared to shift
into overdrive. A White House
spokesman had at first said that
Reagan was unhurt and the net-
works went with the story as
told by the White House. Yet the
critics will conveniently forget
this, and assail the press .:as too
instantaneous in its coverage.

Third, the videotape of the
assassination attempt is
awesome. The camermen who
disregarded their own safety in
order to accurately record
events. will naturally receive
praise from the network heirar-
chy, but will most likely be
forgotten by the critics.

The opponents of television
news will instead focus on the
network’s running and rerun-
ning in slow motion and still
frame of the gruesome
shooting. What millions of us
Saw was certainly not pleasant.
It was real, it was vivid. Yet

BOOKS BY SAMUEL LOGAN SANDERSON, WASHINGTON
AND LEE GRADUATE, CLASS OF 1922, SINCE 1975 A RESI-
DENT OF ROCKBRIDGE COUNTY. AVAILABLE AT
WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY BOOKSTORE.

Science in Culture: A Study of Values and Institutions. $2.95.
From the perspective of more than three-quarters of a century,
drawing on the resources of a long life devoted to observation,
study, and reflection, on the basis of his view that a civilization is
characterized chiefly by the priority it assigns to values, the author
has analyzed our present society and assessed its place in history

Elements. A Sequence of Poems. Boxed. $6.00. This book,
published in 1932, elicited the following comments from reviewers:
“A distinct, unique note in modern poetry. A sort of blank verse
that seems to create a new brand of this form’’ (Contempo). ‘Lines
that are vibrant with melody and yet simultaneously place the em-
phasis upon scientific fact” (Portland Oregon Journal). ‘‘These
poems, apparently treating of complex subjects, are done with a
simplicity of expression which adds much to their beauty” (High
Point Enterprise). ““A superb work. Sanderson may rest assured
that now he will be heard, for even if but a few read him, he-will
definitely and assuredly have placed his impress on their thought”’

One on the Aisle:

A Fine, Evocative ‘Angel’

by M. Shaw Pyle

It was Saturday night at the
Troubador for the final perfor-
mance of Look Homeward,
Angel. Wouldn’t you know, we
finally get good weather for a
performance and — it’s SRO.
The ‘‘varsity’’ crowd was out in
full force, and we got our pre-
show kicks watching the Great
Seating Marathon as _ ticket-
holders engaged in nasty squab-
bling over seats. Apparently,
someone at the box office lost
track big time and there was a
Who concert-style free-for-all.
We must point out that the
Troubadour shoe-box —
whoops, we mean ‘‘theatre’’
is hardly suited for festival
seating. Director Al Gordon
tried frantically to straighten
things out, but to little avail: it
was like sending a priest to talk
lemmings down off the cliffs.

So, here we are, resembling
nothing so much as a tin of kip-
pered herrings. And, d’you
(figuratively, of course — you
know the Troub), no one no-
ticed. By which we mean, the
play was good. Very good. To
wit: the sets were evocative,
multi-purpose, well-
constructed, and most in-
novative: one could see the
whole boarding house, on
various levels and removes —
which contributed mightily to
dramatic flow. It was, however,
given the size of the stage, a bit
cramped — though nothing
compared with the audience, of
course. The lighting tended
towards extremes: utter
darkness or blazing glare. Part
of this may have been inten-
tional, but we are inclined to
ascribe most of it to the defi-

ciencies of the facilities at this

here renowned liberal arts in-
sty-tew-shun. The production

details (costuming, sound cues,
and so forth) were all neatly in
place (you never miss the water
till the well runs dry), and one
could concentrate on the perfor-
mance.

Actually, one could hardly
help doing so. The acting was
very much on the acceptable
side — except when it was bet-
ter than that. Frank Billingsley
turned in a fine performance as
Ben Gant, the small-town
newspaperman and _profes-
sional cynic, a workaholic set
for self-destruct (he’s been
watching John Billmyre again).
Laura de Maria’s Mrs. Pert was
simply adorable, as was Ginger
McNeese’s Miss Brown (a
return to her traditional casting
as a fluttery, small-time flirt —
a true Daughter of the Regi-
ment). Andy Butteg was
workmanlike as the _long-
suffering Hugh Barton, and
Beedle White and Rose Gordon
— well! As Helen Gant Barton
and Eliza Gant, they made
abundantly clear the root of the
difficulties facing the Gant
men. Kipling was right: certain
women should be struck
regularly, like gongs. Les Clark
has found his metier: it is hard
to infuse titanic motion into that
lanky frame, as those of us who
saw the ‘“‘comic”’ Pinter noted.
But, as the dyspeptic
moneyman Uncle Will
Pentland, Clark shone. Well,
glittered with a_ script-
promped dullness, at any rate.
As for Our Hero, the portriat of
the artist as a young whatnot,
Drew Perkins’ Gene Gant was

more than adequate, and, in
places, admirable. Bill Sherwin
was proficient in his role as the
disgusting Jake Clatt, and Pree
Ray was most acceptable-and
often hilarious — as his descript
and hostile mother. Shirley
Hughes hit pay dirt as the sex-
starved Florry Mangle, Greg
Glessner was pure Gall as the
{florid dance master Mr. Farrel,
‘and Scott Stanton handled
townie Tarkington perfectly
well. Paula Langdon was as
good as she could be as Laura
James, the Richmond belle with
whom our southern aesthetic
hero is smitten — but the script,
in attempting to make her a
symbol, leaves her forlornly on
the periphery. Richard Boaz’
W.O. Gant, the stonecutter with
artistic ambitions who becomes
obsessed with the stone angel of
the title to the point of isola-
tion from his family, achieved
almost mythic proportions. Ted
Petrides’ Luke Gant was well
crafted enough, and Earle
Greene’s Dr. McGuire was the
sort of GP we've been looking
for for some time. Finally — but
by no means insignificantly
—Marjorie Poindexter was fan-
tastic — but fantastic — in her
debut as the black madame,
Mme. Elizabeth. This critic
snickered himself sick. Kudos
to all the above.

In the final analysis, the play
was fine, while it lasted. But, as
Al Gordon points out, Eugene
Gant’s rite of passage to
maturity is one of many such in-
cidents in the literature: a
“universal theme.’’ Amen to
that. It’s a rich vein, but it’s get-
ting overworked even at that.
Oh, well, what do we know?

Record Slips To 4-8

by Dale Park

The Washington and Lee var-
sity tennis team brought its
overall record to 4-8 on the
season by winning two of five
matches in last week’s action.

On Tuesday, March 24, the
Generals lost to Division I VMI,
8-1. Senior co-captain Doug
Gaker took over at the number
one singles spot for the absent
Pete Lovell and provided the
Generals with their only win of
the day with an impressive 7-6,
3-6, 6-4 victory.

The following day, W&L got
back on track by clobbering
Division II Radford 8-1. The
Generals swept the top singles
flights and all three doubles
positions. Singles winners in-
cluded senior co-captain Lovell,
back again at the first flight;
Gaker at second singles;
sophomore Steve Denny at the
third position; junior Wes
Yonge at the fourth spot; and
freshman Scott Berman at fifth
singles.

In doubles, Lovell and Gaker
teamed up for a 7-5, 6-2 victory
at the first flight. Denny and
Yonge took the second position
with a 7-5, 2-6, 7-6 win, and Ber-
man teamed with classmate
Charles Kalocsay for a 7-5, 5-7,
6-0 triumph at third doubles.

The Generals made it two ina
row by pounding Division III
Greensboro 9-0 on March 26.
Significant in this match were
the performances by the
Generals’ two freshman
players, Berman and Kalocsay.

Berman breezed in his fifth
singles match, 6-4, 6-2, while
Kalocsay won easily at the sixth
spot, 6-3, 7-5. Both players
teamed at third singles for a 6-2,
6-1 romp.

W&L ended up this five-day
stretch by losing a pair of tough

9-0 matches to two talented
teams; the Generals bowed to
Division II Hampton Institute
on March 28 and Division I
Brown University the following
day.

Commenting on these two
teams, head coach Gary
Franke said, “Brown is an
outstanding team comprised of
mostly freshman and
sophomore performers. Hamp-
ton is still almost as good as
when they won the Division II
crown back in 1976, and they
have Six excellent foreign
players on their team.”

Beginning on April 13, the
Generals will begin a six-day
southern swing which includes
Emory University (April 13);
the University of Central
Florida (April 14); Rollins Col-
lege (April 15); Flagler College
(April 17); and the University
of Florida (April 18).

It was a long ride home Satur-
day, the Towson State Tigers
scored a decisive 19-11 victory
over W&L in lacrosse.

The Tigers scored two
straight goals at the end of the
first half, and left the field with
a 9-5 lead. In what appeared to
be the beginning of a second
half General rally, junior at-
tackman Mike Pressler scored,
bringing the total to 9-6.

However, the rally was short-
lived, as Towson scored four
unanswered goals. With the
score 13-6, Pressler again
scored twice. The Tigers
responded as they had before,
scoring five consecutive goals

and putting the game out of
reach.

Sophomore Geoff Wood, a
W&L attackman, scored 4 goals
and was credited with one

 

assist, helping him to earn the
W&L Player of the Game honor.
Pressler finished the game with
3 tallies and Rob Staugaitis
finished with one goal and four
assists.
Freshman Barry Waterman
commented, ‘Obviously we
weren’t pleased about the gang,
but is wasn’t an attitudinal pro-
blem.’’ He continued, ‘If we:
play our game, we can beat
anybody. N.C. State lured us in-
to playing their game.”’
Waterman said the team did
not seem to be bothered by the
latest USILA-Poll, in which
W&L was not ranked.

The next two weeks will be
crucial for W&L lacrosse. On
April 14, W&L will face William
and Mary at Wilson Field, and
on April 19, W&L will face their
toughest opponent of the year,

Towson Dumps Generals

the University of Virginia. If
W&L hopes to be chosen for the
NCAA playoffs, scheduled for
late May, they must turn the
season around.

A victory against William and
Mary would be a step in the
right direction, but of greater
importance would be a victory
over U.Va.

With U.Va. currently ranked
4 nationally, the lacrosse team
will encounter a_ situation
similar to that of the basketball
team in their game against
Roanoke. A victory would pro-
vide the opportunity for na-
tional recognition.

Although the game is schedul-
ed for the day before spring
term classes start, fan support
could turn the lacrosse team’s
season around.

 

Middle Rob Carpenter scoops up a ground ball in yesterday’s defeat of Deleware. The Generals evened
their record at 2-2 with yesterday’s win.

Golf ‘Blossoms’ With Weather

by Scott Mason
Now that spring has arrived
and weather conditions have
improved, so it seems that the
Washington and Lee golf team

has blossomed as well. Coming
off a wind and rain hampered
tournament of two weeks ago,

in which the Generals finished a

disappointing 13th, the team
around and
literally crushed Bridgewater

turned things

and Shepherd colleges in a

match played at the Lexington

Country Club course last week.

Furthering their undefeated

record of 3 and 0, the team is
performing well, according to
Coach Buck Leslie. In last
week’s match, W&L posted a
396 score to Bridgewater’s 445
and Shepherd’s 482. Several
players’ turned in impressive
scores on the 71-par course, in-
cluding Jim Kaplan’s 75, and
senior co-captain Gerry
Barousse’s 78. Steve Everett
chipped in with 79, Tom
Wohlfarth an 80, and junior co-
captain Bill Alfano with an 84.
The key, indicated Leslie, is
team balance. When one man

doesn’t perform well; the others
pick up the slack. Said Leslie,
“One guy picks up the other.”’

The Generals’ face
Bridgewater and Longwood to-
day, tbe toughest competition,
thus far in the season. “‘It will
be a good test today,’’ says an
optimistic Leslie, and with
superb weather conditions, the
team appears hopeful for
posting yet another couple of
wins.

The team will lay down their

clubs after today’s match for a
couple of weeks due to exams

and spring vacation, which,
comments Leslie, this could
prove to be a real handicap.
With the break, the team’s
momentum may be snapped,
and they will have to work hard
in regaining that tempo as the
season resumes. “‘It’s tough,”’
says Leslie, ‘‘but we’ve done it
before in the past.”’

Whether the Generals can
adequately maintain that tem-
po and prove equal to the test
will be revealed on the 17th and
18th of April when the team
travels to the Virginia Tech
‘Gobbler Classic.”

Baseball Team Loses Three of Last Four

by John Harrison
The W&L baseball team
finished its last week before ex-
ams by dropping three of four
games, as they fell below .500
for the first time this season.

The Generals returned to
Smith Field after splitting a
doubleheader at Randolph-
Macon last Tuesday. This was
the first game the Generals
have managed to take from the
Yellow Jackets since anyone
would care to admit.

An 0-5 Lock Haven St. (Pa.)
squad was the opposition last
Thursday, but the Bald Eagles
took an early lead against
starter Jim Halprin and went on
to claim their first victory. Lock
Haven scored in the first four
innings and held an 8-2 lead,
before coach Craig Jones called
in Jim Stanley to relieve
Halprin. Halprin was tagged for
three triples in the first inning,
and home runs by Chris Wilt in
the second and Ed Vaz in the
third.

After giving up three runs in
the fifth, Stanley settled down to
shut out Lock Haven for the
next three innings. He did allow
two unearned runs in the ninth.

While Stanley was nearly

perfect from the sixth to eighth |

innings, the Generals were
unable to do anything against

starter and winner Paul Haren-
char. W&L did score three
times in the fifth, but left the
bases loaded after Mike Walsh

 

 

Generals southpaw
game.

knocked in one run with a
sacrifice fly and Dave War-
renfeltz forced in another with a
walk. Warrenfeltz finished the

   
 

 

im Halprin

game with two RBI’s.

The rest of W&L’s offense was
provided by second baseman
Chris Cavalline, who went 4-5,
and rightfielder Don Dudley,
who had two singles and a walk.
Things didn’t get any better

     

through in an earlier

the next day when ODAC oppo-
nent Bridgewater took on the
Generals. W&L committed five.
errors, falling behind early

once again en route to a 13-3
loss. Junior Jim Brockelman
was a victim of the Generals’
porous fielding and his own in-
ability to throw strikes; five of
the nine runs he allowed
resulted from either walks, wild
pitches or his own errors.

Bridgewater’s Mark Puckett
showed why he made the ODAC
All Star team last year. The se-
cond baseman went 3-4 with 3
RBI’s, a walk, and a run scored.
Greg Maynard added 2 RBI’s
for the Eagles.

For the Generals, Cavalline
was 2-4 with a run scored, and
Walsh drove in a run. With
these exceptions, W&L couldn’t
do much more at the plate
against Tommy Thomas, who
pitched a complete game.

W&L split a doubleheader at
Maryville last Saturday.
junior Dave Randall was im-
pressive while throwing a
six-hit shutout in the first game.
Cavalline continued his hitting
tear by smacking a homer, and
Tom Coates had two hits in the

9-0 triumph. Rich Hachenburg
pitched almost as well as Ran-

dall, but received little offen-.

sive support as the Generals

dropped the second game, 3-1.
So, after the first month of the

season, the Generals’ record is
3-5 in the ODAC and 6-7 overall.

Some changes will be made in
the lineup when W&L returns to
action with home
doubleheaders against
Hampden-Sydney and Eastern
Mennonite on the 14th and 16th
of April. Hachenburg will be in
Germany taking part in a study
abroad program. Coach Jones
plans to move Dudley to his
place on the mound. Coach
Jones is hoping that Marty
Thomas will be fully recovered
from his elbow injury.

Jones expects that center-
fielder. Thad Ellis will raise his
average, to the .393 mark he at-
tained last year, when he was
named a third-team Division III
All-American. “It’s not that
Thad looks bad,”’ said Jones,
‘but he hasn’t looked super. He
still has a smooth stroke, and
the speed to help him catch a lot
of fly balls.”’ Finally, the coach
said that the two most consis-
tent performers so far have
been Randall, who leads the pit-
ching staff with 3 wins and three
complete games, and Cavalline,
who leads in doubles, triples,
and batting (.500). He has also
been pleased with the defensive
play of catcher Tripp Brower
and shortstop Jody Harris.

Track Team Splits Meets, Seven ODAC Marks Set

by Ralph Frasca

The Washington and Lee
track ream split two trimeets
held at W&L while setting seven
ODAC highs.

On Mar. 27, the Generals
defeated Newport News College
and ODAC rival Emory &
Henry. W&L was_ heavily
favored to win the meet, but
met stiff opposition from
Newport News, which scored 73
points to W&L’s 94. Emory &
Henry amasses only nine
points.

The Generals gave up some
points in the jumping events, as
one of their top jumpers was in-
jured. Russ Rector was sidelin-
ed with a pulled hamstring mus-

cle.
However, the W&L runners

mance. Keith Kadesky
registered two of the six ODAC
top performances. He won the
100-meter dash in 11.36 seconds
and the 200-meter event in 23.19.
Jon Kelefant recorded a time of
16:31 in the 5000 meter run and
the W&L 440 relay team turned
in a 44.7 secind time.

ODAC standards were also
set in two other events. John
McKee captured the shot put
witha distance of 43 feet, two in-
ches and Alan Armitage posted
a 16:22 time in the 110-meter
hurdles.

‘‘We didn’t win the meet by as
great a margin as Coach
Aldridge thought,” Armitage
said.

On Mar. 31, W&L placed se-
cond in a tri-meet with
Christopher Newport and
Eastern Mennonite College.
CNC totaled 93 points to W&L’s
69. Mennonite placed a distant
third with 19 points.

“Christopher Newport beat
us in the sprint and distance
running events,’ Armitage
said. ‘“We were simply outclass-
ed.”

W&L’s Gene Fellin turned in
the ODAC high in the pole vault,
attaining a height of 12 feet.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Election Follies

Last week’s elections for important student govern-
ment positions were a disgrace, and the Executive
Committee as well as the Voting Regulations Board
are responsible for a debacle that will hopefully be
remedied in the future.

One poll ran out of ballots, possibly costing a
freshman candidate his chance for election. Polls
were not manned the entire time, leading even the
casual observer to speculate as to the accuracy of the
election. Campaign posters were torn down, too many
were put up by several candidates, some in apart-
ment buildings blocks from the campus, and as junior
EC member Eric Myers observed, there were more
violations of campaign rules this year than ever
before.

Of the Executive Committee’s many respon-

sibilities, one of its more important jobs is to ensure
that the VRB does its job. The VRB complains that too
few students actively participate in its activities —
and the EC agrees. But what it really comes down to
is the fact that at least for the moment, both are sear-
ching for a way to put this issue on the back burner.

At Monday night’s meeting, sophomore EC
member Pete Baumgaertner volunteered to take a
closer look at this problem. When he asked for
assistance from other members, not one offered to
help. Only after nervous laughter and excuses from
most of the ten EC members did Jeff Edwards agree
to aid Baumgaertner. It is unfortunate the EC does

not believe the issue as crucial as it really is.

The problem can only become more acute in the
future unless action is taken now. The present Ex-
ecutive Committee has shown that it can tackle any
problem it chooses — if it wants to. Best we believe
that next year may be too late. Now is the time to act.
Drastic steps are needed in order to correct serious
defects in the election process at Washington and Lee.

Let’s hope the EC thinks so too.

Latture Award

Omicron Delta Kappa is now
accepting nominations for the
Rupert M. Latture Outstanding
Sophomore Award. The award,
established this year, is named
after the long time Washington
and Lee Professor and Ad-
ministrator who is a founding
member of Omicron Delta Kap-
pa.
The award recipient, to be
chosen by a committee of ODK
faculty and student members,
will be the sophomore who most
exemplifies ODK ideals. While
academic excellence will be a
major factor in the selection
process, other considerations
will include extent of extracur-
ricular interests, demonstra-
tion of leadership ability and
potential, and strength of in-
dividual character.

Nominations are due April 10
and should be delivered,in
writing, to Mr. Taylor Sanders
in Washington Hall. The award
committee will consider accom-
panying written material sup-
porting the nomination. Ques-
tions concerning the award
should be addressed to Mr.
-Sanders or to Sam Flax, ext.
245.

Correction

It was incorrectly reported
last week that three university
security men are currently
patrolling the campus and other
university property.

According to a letter from
Dean Lewis John, the number is
actually ten. These include Bob
Murray and his two assistants,
one man at the athletic center
and six watchmen.

At the urging of a number of
students in the W&L communi-
ty, we are writing this to ex-
press our concern over the pro-
posed closing of the record
store. Although the record store
offers a share of current
popular music, it’s the only
place within the area which
makes available a selection of
alternative music such as jazz,
classical, folk, and imported
rock artists.

We feel that the service the
record store provides is essen-
tis] to the cultural environment
of the W&L community. A very
large amount of money current-
ly goes to pay for live entertain-
ment and social events many of
which students are not able to
attend or would even prefer not
!.0 attend. The record store per-
mits anyone to make his or her
own choices concerning music.
Of course, music available
through the store can also
enhance the experience gained
through a school sponsored
musical event.

Beyond the students, faculty,
and townspeople who make per-
sonal use of the record store, it

quality of programming in all
musical areas.

We are dismayed with the
manner in which the decision to
close the record store was
reached. We feel the issue
should have first been brought
before the community and
discussed prior to any final
decisions which you seem to
have made. Alternative pro-
posals for the successful opera-
tion of the record store do not
seek to have been given ade-
quate emphasis.

We believe .that altering
operating operating procedures
to achieve break-even status is
preferable to closing the store,
and even if the store continued
to incur a small deficit under a
more efficient operation, we
feel the use of student and/or
University funds to support the
store would be worthwhile.

Music is indeed an essential
element of a liberal arts educa-
tion. We urge the administra-
tion and the student body to ac-
tively push to keep this precious
resource flowing. and to recon-
sider their decision to close the
record store.

We saw a smiling president, a

And by repeating and slowing

the entire incident in its most
important light — accurately.

The media was _ accurate
when it unfortunately reported
the ‘‘death’’ of Jim Brady — as
accurate as their White House
sources. The networks, of
course, do not simply report
what they hear because too
often what is heard, especially
around Washington, is false and
innaccurate. But the three ma-

then were able to confirm that
Brady was dead, they went with
the story. In the swirl of activity

The television audience,
which grew as the afternoon
progressed, got a good and ac-
curate look inside the
newsrooms of three of the most
expensive, comprehensive
news gathering machines in the
world. What one sees on the
evening news is the finished
product. The hard work, tur-
moil, decision-making and com-
plexities of reporting the news
is what few ever see. Reporting
the news isn’t easy, but it is im-

portant. Monday was no excep-
tion, nor was it basically dif-
ferent than what occurs every
day of the year.

The press, especially the net-
works, should be applauded for
the exceptional job they did.
Not only did they gather, inter-
pret and report the news quick-
ly and accurately, but they have
learned some lessons should the
inevitable occur again. Let’s
hope they don’t have to apply
these valuable experiences to
report a similar story in the
future.

The more alcohol Washington
and Lee students drink, the
more apt they are to comment
favorably about their social life,
according to a poll conducted
during Spring term registra-
tion.

Among those who said they
drank from between 15-30
alcoholic beverages a week,
roughly 40 percent indicated
they were ‘‘very satisfied” with
W&L’s social life while almost
38 percent said they were
“somewhat satisfied.”’

The number of students who
do not drink at all but were
equally enthusiastic about the
social situation was substantial-
ly smaller, with only ten per-

cent saying they were “very ©

satisfied.”’ Almost 16 percent of
this non-aleohol consuming
group said they were “very
dissatisfied”’ with the social life
compared with but two percent
for those who drank up to 30
drinks a week.

The statistics were gathered
using a survey administered to
675 students by politics pro-
fessor William Buchanan’s
class in research methods. It
was commissioned by the Ex-
ecutive Committee following
committee discussions on
alcohol abuse at the university.

According to information
compiled by the class, figures
indicate that W&L students not
only average nine drinks during
the week, but that roughly 11
percent consume at least 25

Arita

drinks every seven days.

Fewer W&L students are non-
drinkers than have been found
in similar polls at other col-
leges. About eight percent said

 

said 4 *

idol

they never have a drink, three
percent lower than was found in
similar studies.

In results that could have an
impact on Student Activities
Board sponsored parties in the
future, the poll found that about
61 percent of all students ques-
tioned would drink soft drinks in
addition to alcohol if non-
alcoholic beverages were
available at parties. Thirteen
percent said they would drink
soft drinks instead of alcohol if
it was available while 23 per-
cent said they would drink
alcohol regardless.

According to the report issued
to the Executive Committee,
“the large proportion who
would take the soft drinks in ad-
dition to hard drinks suggests

that there is a substantial seg-
ment of the student body who
may be drinking liquor ex-
cessively when they would
prefer an alternative at some
point during the party.”’

Neil Sheehan, one of the seven
students who worked on the
poll, warned that because only
48 percent of all students
bothered to answer the ques-
tionaire, the results could be an
underestimate of drinking
habits at Washington and Lee.

Brooks Flippen, Michael
Gregory, James Herbert,
Thomas McCoy, Eden Li and
Mark Torres also were respon-
sible for the poll and report,
which will be available in both

and library.

No Law Petitions
Received For UC

by W. Cope Moyers

Despite a recent controversy
involving the relationship be-
tween the undergraduate and
law campuses, not one petition
for law school positions on the
University Council was receiv-
ed at Monday night’s Executive
Committee meeting.

Petitions with 50 signatures
were due in the EC room by 6:30
p.m. Monday night, but at the
start of the meeting, committee
president Bob Willis announced
that none had been turned in to
the EC.

After the meeting, Willis said
he was concerned no law
students were interested in run-
ning for the University Council
position, especially since it has
been the council which has this
year examined why the two
campuses do not enjoy better
relations.

Willis also said that the coun-
cil needs a law student included
on it.

Led by Willis, the Executive
Committee recently sought to
discover why there is a rift be-
tween Lewis Hall and the Col-
onade. The split, which has
developed for reasons ranging
from separate graduation
ceremonies and _ staggered
holidays to different social

Receives

Award

The Virginia Psychological
Association presented Dr.
Leonard E. Jarrard, head of
Washington and Lee Universi-

with an award at the organiza-

Jarrard received che associa-
tion’s award for Outstanding
Contribution to Psychology as a

As part of the meeting, Jar-
rard presented a paper, “‘On the

based on his  contjnuing
research into the hippocampus,
a segment of the brain that is
associated with several serious
disorders including epilepsy.

Trustees. The matter was taken
up by the University Council
following the committee’s con-
cern.

Because there is a chance law
students may decide to run as
write-in candidates, the EC set
campaign guidelines. Can-
didates are allowed a five dollar
budget, 15 posters and no ban-
ners. In addition, posters are
limited to Lewis Hall.

Ina related matter, Willis an-
nounced that similar petitions
for undergraduate represen-
tatives to the University Coun-
cil are due at Monday’s EC
meeting, with the election May
4. The committee will set cam-
paign rules at the next meeting.

In other business, the com-
mittee heard a report from Eric
Myers and Neil Sheehan con-
cerning drinking at W&L. (See
article, page 1)

The committee also
unanimously agreed to recom-
mend that the Library Advisory
Committee provide sufficient
change at the front desk for
students wishing to use library
copy machines. Pete
Baumgaertner said that many
students had complained: that
there were never enough dimes
for change.

 

-W&L Bequeathed $1 Million
For Endowed Scholarship

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has received a bequest of
more than $1-million from the
estate of Egbert B. Doggett, a
1914 graduate of the university,
for the creation of an endowed
honor scholarship.

The Egbert B. Doggett
Scholarship Endowment will
fund scholarships that are to be
awarded on the basis of
academic merit, strong traits of
character, and financial need.

Doggett was a native of Dan-
ville, Va., who received his
bachelor of science degree in
civil engineering from W&l
After working as an engineer
for the city of Philadelphia im-
mediately following his gradua-
tion, Doggett served with the
603rd Engineers in the 5th Army
from July, 1918 through July,
1919.

Following the war, Doggett
joined the Bethlehem Steel
Company in Bethlehem, Pa., as
an accountant. He worked for
Bethlehem Steel from 1920 until
his retirement in 1961 as an ex-
ecutive in that company’s ac-
counting department and also
as an actuary for the pension
and relief plans for the corpora-
tion. He died on October 2, 1978.

In announcing the universi-
ty’s receipt of the Doggett be-

In other business, Sigma Nu
was reprimanded for throwing
bottles at Phi Delta Theta and
Phi Kappa Sigma. Sigma Nu
president, Beau Hodge, explain-
ed that the bottles were thrown
by a few individuals, and that
the fraternity itself was not
responsible. Hodge also stated
that his fraternity would pay for
any damage caused by the bot-
tles, and that Sigma Nu is tak-
ing disciplinary action against
those responsible.

quest, which totals $1,059,829,
Washington and Lee University
president Robert E.R. Huntley
said: ‘Mr. Doggett’s years at
Washington and Lee early in
this century were a tremendous
influence upon his life. Now,
through his foresight and
generosity, new generations of
deserving students will benefit
from the accomplishments of
his long life. We are grateful
and pleased that we are able to
honor his memory in this way.’

The Doggett Scholarship En-
dowment becomes an integral
part of the extensive financial
aid program Washington and

Lee administers annually.

Moreover, the Doggett be-
quest applies toward the goal of
$12.5-million in new endowment
that is included in the $26-
million second phase of the
university’s current develop-
ment program. After  suc-
cessfully completing the first
phase of the program in 1976 by
raising $37.5-million ($1.5-
million above the goal of $36-
million), the university has
$17.5-million in commitments
toward the second phase goal of
$26-million. The second phase is
to be concluded by December of
1981.

Spencer Exhibits
Photography In duPont

An exhibition of the
photography of Nancy Spencer
is on display in Washington and
Lee University’s duPont
Gallery through May 8.

A 1969 graduate of Hollins
College, Ms. Spencer was a
staff photographer for
Washington and Lee from 1977
through 1979 and has been doing
freelance photography since
1978. Her works have been ex-
hibited in Richmond, Lynch-
burg, Charlottesville and
Winston-Salem, N.C.

Several of the works in the du-
Pont exhibition are the product
of Ms. Spencer’s recent ex-
perimentation with the
“Diana,” an inexpensive
plastic camera which produces
images reminiscent of the
earliest days of photography.

The ‘“‘Diana” camera, which
is no longer being produced,
may be best remembered as a
prize often awarded at car-

nivals. The camera must be
taped after loading each time to
make it light-proof. Ms.

Spencer has been working with
the ‘‘Diana”’ since participating
in a workshop in Maine in 1979.

The gallery is open daily trom
9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at no charge
to the public.

‘the staff learned control pro-
cedures the hard way — from

The mistakes fortunately
were few, and were corrected
during the course of the

all the importance of flexibility
— of making rapid responses to
changing situations, and this
was true for all the cadets
here,”’ stated senior Cadet Doug
Shipman.

For the many sophomores
and freshmen who took part as
squad members, the FTX pro-
vided exposure to the military
field environment and a taste of
simulated battle — valuable
grounding for their future in

Film Notes

M (Germany, 1930) — Fritz Lang directs Peter Lorre in this
psychological thriller about a non-descript child-molester and
murderer finally apprehended, not by the Berlin police, but by his
fellow criminals. Originally entitled The Murderers Amongst Us,
production was halted on the film by order of the Nazi hierarchy,
who thought the title referred to the Party.

Boudu Saved From Drowning and A Day in the Country (France,
1932 and 1936) — Jean Renoir, son of the Impressionist painter,
centers his films on the water: in Boudu, the tramp of the title is
hauled out of the Seine by a bourgeois gentleman, in upon whom he
promptly moves — for good. After wreaking havoc amongst the
convential, he stands in severe danger of becoming respectable
himself, until he falls into the river again and floats away to resume
his former habits. Rather Chaplinesque.

In A Day..., Renoir adapts a tale of Maupassant’s dealing with
middle-class frivolity and seduction down by the riverside.

Baseball Team Qualifies,

Massacred By Lynchburg

by John Harrison

Perhaps the best news of spr-
ing break involved the
Washington and Lee baseball
team. The Generals reached a
milestone when they qualified
for the fifth annual Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference Cham-
pionship Tournament by taking
home doubleheaders from
Hampden-Sydney and Eastern
Mennonite.

The tournament, in which the
top four teams of the eight-team
league will participate, is the
first in which the Generals will
appear. Competition will be
provided by Randolph-Macon,
Bridgewater, and defending
champion Lynchburg. The
Hornets, loaded with talent at
every position, will host the
tournament on Saturday, April
25, at Lynchburg City Stadium.

“At the beginning of the
season I could see that we had
the talent to qualify,”’ said head
coach Craig Jones. ‘The real
key turned out to be our perfor-
mances last week. The chips
were down and we needed wins,
so the guys responded by not
giving our opponents
anything.”

Jones continued, ‘‘Early in
the season we dropped deci-
sions to some of the teams who
did not make the tournament.
We had no business losing to
these teams (Maryville and
Emory & Henry). This gave us
a poor conference record (3-5).
However, last week we got good
pitching, runs when we needed
them, and steady fielding.”

Pitching was the Generals’
strength last week, as all four
starting W&L hurlers threw
complete games. Junior Dave
Randall started off the week by
lasting all twelve innings in the
first game against Hampden-
Sydney.. Senior Tom Coates
singled in the winning run. In
the night-cap, Rich Hachen-
burg, making his last ap-
pearance before leaving for
Germany in a study-abroad pro-

gram, triumphed in a 6-3 deci-
sion.

bit more offense two days later,

The Washington and Lee var-
sity tennis team came away
with only one team victory on
their annual ‘‘southern swing’’
tour, which lasted from April
13-18.

However, by playing six
tough Division I and II teams in
as many days, the Generals
gained in match toughness and
experience what they lost in the
won-lost columns.

On April 13, the General
netmen faced Division I Emory
University and lost a 6-3 deci-
sion. Senior co-captains Pete
Lovell and Doug Gaker provid-
ed all three winning points for
W&L; Lovell won his singles
match 4-6, 6-4, 60, while Gaker
claimed his contest, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
Both men then combined for a
6-2, 7-5 win in doubles.

The following day, W&L
travelled to the University of
Central Florida, a Division II
team. The Generals lost the
contest 7-2, yet Gaker made it
two in a row with his 6-4, 6-4 win.
Freshman Charles Kalocsay
provided the other W&L point
with his 7-5, 6-0 victory in
singles.

While the Generals lost a 9-0
decision to Division I South
Florida on the 15th, W&L was

able to take one point off power-
ful Rollins College (Division II)
on the following day. The lone
win was registered by freshman
Scott Berman, who scraped out
his victory at fifth singles 3-6,
7-6 (5-4), 7-6 (5-4).

The only team win that the
Generals managed came
against Division I Stetson Col-
lege on April 17. Standout per-
formances were turned in by
sophomore Steve Denny, who
won his third singles match 6-2,
6-2; junior Wes Yonge, who won
6-2, 6-1 at the fourth spot, and
the freshmen Berman and
Kalocsay, who cruised to easy

victories.

The W&L netmen closed out
their southern tour with a 9-0
loss to Division I Florida on the
18th, before returning to host
the powerful University of
Maryland team on the 20th.

Although the Generals lost
the Maryland match 9-0 as well,
Lovell and Gaker turned in a
tremendous doubles _ perfor-

mance. After winning the first
set 6-2, Lovell and Gaker fell 7-5
(5-1) in the second set and 7-5
(5-2) in the third.

W&L’s next challenge will be
the ODAC tournament, schedul-
ed for April 24-25.

   

Golfers Place Fourth In Classic

by Scott Mason

Despite fears that the week-
long spring break would
hamper the steady progress of
the 1981 Washington and Lee
golf team, the Generals resum-
ed their season magnificently
by taking fourth place at the
Virginia Tech ‘‘Gobbler
Classic.”

The fourteen-team, two-day
tournament was held last Fri-
day and Saturday, and all the
players, remarked Coach Buck
Leslie, performed very well.
Leslie added that he was ex-
ceedingly proud and pleased

with the team’s effort and that.

they made a “‘strong showing
against high caliber schools ”

At the end of the first day, the
Generals jumped out to an early
lead and found themselves in
sole possession of first place.
However, due to strong perfor-
mances by Virginia Tech and
Elon College, the Generals slip-
ped the second day and rounded
out the tournament in fourth
vlace. Nonetheless, the

Generals deserve a hearty pat
on the back, said Leslie, and
should be proud of their suc-
cess.

Boasting a pair of defending
individual champions and a
hope for the best finish ever, the
Washington and Lee track and
field team will participate on
Saturday, April 25, in the fifth
annual Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championship
meet. The event begins at 10:00
a.m. at Bridgewater College,
the defending champion.

‘We'll have an_ interesting
meet primarily because we
have not competed this season
against Bridgewater, who is the
favorite, and against Lynch-
burg, with whom we’ll be battl-

ments 1ith-year head coach
Norris Aldridge. The Generals
were to have faced Lynchburg
on Friday, April 17, before rain
forced cancellation of the event.
W&L will be host to Bridge-

with a first-inning grandslam.
Junior Jim Brockelman held
the Royals in check, thus earn-
ing a 5-1 victory. W&L took the
second game of the twinbill as
freshman leftfielder Mike
Walsh contributed three hits, in-
cluding two doubles, and
sophomore pitcher Jim Stanley
completed the Generals’ finest
week in recent history by throw-
ing a complete game, 7-4 vic-
tory. The wins over Eastern
Mennonite, coupled with a
Randolph-Macon victory over
Hampden-Sydney that same
day, clinched the tournament
berth for W&L.

The Generals, to put it mildly,

at Smith Field. The 24-4 final
score was an awesome indica-
tion of Lynchburg’s ability to hit
consistently and solidly. Even
the LC substitutes refused to let
up in the later innings and give
the Generals’ starters a chance
to make the score respectable.
Lynchburg’s bench was respon-
sible for nine runs in the final
three innings.

In yesterday’s action, the
Generals dropped a 6-5 decision
to Bridgewater, after having
led 5-4 entering the ninth inning.
W&L’s overall record now
stands at 10-9 overall, 7-7 in the

good, and Jones admitted that
his team will be the underdog.

stronger one this season.”

Although Virginia proved the
stronger team last Saturday by
virtue of the final score, W&L
had its high points. The dif-
ference, according to Emmer,
was that the Generals didn’t
capitalize enough.

“We feel we had the right
game plan against Virginia, one
which allowed us to control the
ball and work for the scoring op-
portunities. We just didn’t
capitalize on the opportunities
we created. We missed some
point-blank shots and failed to
convert some extra-man_ at-
tempts.

“It’s an over-used term in the
coaching field, but we needed
better execution. When you play
control ball, you put more em-
phasis on making the most of
the opportunities you create.
We simply didn’t use all those
chances.”’

half minutes of play, neither
team managed to use any

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Drinking Poll

Undoubtedly students and faculty alike will find the
results of the EC sponsored drinking poll of enormous
interest. After years of speculation, there is now some
reliable data as to how much alcohol the average
W&L student actually consumes.

Perhaps the most encouraging statistic is that
students would prefer non-alcoholic drinks at some
point during a party if they were offered. It is hoped
that the SAB, the IFC and individual fraternities will
take the hint and provide non-alcoholic beveriges at
their events.

Such a positive move will not only be benificial to
students, but will also be a step toward the improve-
ment of faculty-fraternity relations. Perhaps the EC
will next consider polling faculty members concern-
ing their drinking habits. The student body would un-
doubtedly find these results especially fascinating.

The Great Divide

The undergraduate-law school gap grew ever wider
this week with the failure of any law student to file a
petition for a UC position. Admittedly this is an unfor-
tunate situation, and Bob Willis and the EC should be
commended for their efforts to reconcile the two
schools. Nevertheless, it should be apparent by now
that neither undergraduates nor law students are
overly concerned in the affairs of the other.

There are just too many obvious differences in
schedules, curriculum and life styles for either school
to mesh congenially together. Besides, when neither
side is interested in interrelations with the other, how
can a solution be found?

For the present, most law students and
undergraduates are complacently resigned to the
status quo; therefore, until students’ attitudes
change, it is futile to make continuous overtures
toward unity between the two schools. Let it be!

Where Are They Now?

Noticeably absent from the Phi this spring are John
Billmyre and Bill Whalen, who have taken newspaper
internships in their hometowns. They are sorely miss-
ed from the staff as their service has been invaluable
throughout the year.

Billmyre as Editor-in-Chief and Whalen as News
Editor have continually been hardworking, efficient
and creative in their work. As journalists, they have
been consistently accurate, concise and ethical in
their reporting, always striving to maintain the high
standards of their profession.

Although their departure has left a wide gap in our
staff, we wish them the best of luck at all their jour-
nalistic endeavors.

Cockpit Needs More Support

Dear Editor,

Since the demise of the record
store it has been interesting to
hear the numerous comments
from persons who say ‘‘wish I
had known the record store was
in trouble, perhaps I would have
frequented it more.’’ There is
another campus facility that is
not being fully utilized and finds
itself in financial difficulty
—the COCKPIT.

It is my opinion that if the
Cockpit were located on Main
Street it would be doing very,
very well. However, we are not
on Main Street but rather hid-
den in the bottom of the Univer-
sity Center. Since we are not
allowed to advertise in the local
media we are locked in on a
rather small captive audience
— our own W&L Community.
Contrary to what, in some
cases, seems to be common
knowledge in the Lexington
community, the COCKPIT is
open to the public and we do en-
courage them, by word or
mouth, to try our cuisine. At
lunch you will routinely find a
dozen or so faculty members
who are regular customers, half
a dozen students and a few off-
campus guests. At dinner you
will see a dozen or so students, a
faculty member or two, and a
few outside guests. If you hap-
pen to come by on a night when
there is a band you will pro-
bably see the entire student
body (somewhat of an exag-
geration since we only have 160
seats). Why isn’t the Cockpit
getting more business from the
campus community? I doubt
there is much question that we
have the nicest room and the
cheapest prices in town for a
comparable menu. The food is
good as well as inexpensive. Ad-
mittedly, when we do get an oc-
casional rush the service may
be somewhat slower but a ‘‘nor-
mal work schedule”’ is based on
‘normal business’, and our
business at lunch and dinner is
slow.

We have made every effort to
attract additional student
business. We built a stage for
the SAB to bring in bands. We

 

took out the juke box and in-
stalled an FM/tape recording
system. We purchased a wide-
screen TV. We have offered
special after special: happy
hour, 30 cent hot dogs, '2 price
french fries, free popcorn, etc.,
etc. (See ad elsewhere in this
paper). We have a soup and
sandwich special and a salad

  

bar every day at lunch. The
COCKPIT provides numerous
student jobs with a payroll of
about $2500 per month and is
managed by students at night.
In conclusion, the COCKPIT
is your student tavern and it
needs your support. It needs the
continued support of the SAB,
providing bands for the student
body, that it got during the fall
term. We need your input as to
what more would you like us to
do to upgrade your tavern? If
the COCKPIT is a viable enter-
tainment center for you on cam-
pus and you want it to continue,
please let us know, by your
presence and your suggestions
— before it is too late.
Sincerely,
Gerald J. Darrell
Director of Food Service

Jeans’

Grant
Furthers

Biography

Dr. Roger B. Jeans Jr.,
associate professor of history at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, has been awarded a
research grant from the
Maurice L. Mednick Memorial
Fund for study this summer.

Jeans will use his Mednick
research grant to further his
work on a biography of Carsun
Chang, a well-known 20th cen-
tury Chinese philosopher and
politician.

The Mednick Memorial Fund
is administered by the Virginia
Foundation for Independent
Colleges (VFIC), a joint fund-
raising consortium of 12 four-
year private colleges in the
State, including W&L.

Jeans’ research will include
exploration of the holdings on
20th century China of the Public
Record Office in London and in-
vestigation of the British
Museum’s collection of English
language treaty’ port
newspapers. He also plans
research at the National Ar-
chives in Washington and in-
vestigation of material

deposited with the Chinese Oral -

   
 

Asian history and has written
numerous articles on that sub-
ject.

The Mednick Memorial Fund
was created in 1976 after the ac-
cidental death of the young Nor-
folk industrialist. His family
and business associates
established the fund _ to
perpetuate his name and to
recognize his own strong in-
terest in higher education.

The VFIC administers the
fund to encourage the profes-
sional development of college
teachers and improve their
competence through grants for
research and advanced study,
and to assist highly qualified,
needy students in their up-
perclass years in college.

 

Robert P. Fure has been nam-
ed Director of Summer Pro-
grams and Assistant Director of
Publications at Washington and
Lee University.

A 1968 graduate of Northern
Michigan University, Fure
earned both his M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees in English from the
University of California at

Berkeley. He joined the
Washington and Lee faculty in
1977 as assistant professor of
English.

In addition to courses in
American literature and
modern poetry, Fure has
designed and taught inter-
disciplinary courses in art and
literature while at W&L. He has
also published articles on a

Stewart Composition

To Be Performed

A musical composition by
Washington and Lee University
music professor Robert Stewart
will be presented by the Brass
Chamber Music Society of An-
napolis, Md., on Sunday, April
26, in Annapolis.

The Brass Quintet No. 3, one
of the three concerts in the
series, was originally composed
as a ballet but has been per-
formed without dancers in the
past.

The Annapolis performance
will be the first with dancers.

The Murray Spaulding Dance
Theater will perform the ballet,
choreographed by Murray
Spaulding. The Annapolis Brass
Quintet will perform the piece.
The Quintet is described as ‘‘a

combination of rugged expres- _

sionism and lyricism in an
atonal idiom.”

Stewart, who received three
master of music degrees from
the American Conservatory in
Chicago, has been a member of
the Washington and Lee faculty
since 1954.

SKANK
 

Leonel L. Kahn Jr., associate
professor of drama at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, died Sunday night in a Lex-
ington hospital following a
lengthy illness. He was 46.

A memorial service was held
at 2 p.m. Tuesday in Lee
Chapel. Rabbi Sheldon Ezring
conducted the service, assisted
by Dr. David W. Sprunt.

Kahn is survived by his wife,
Betty Spitzberg Kahn Of Lex-
ington; two sons, Jerome Ed-
ward Kahn of Dallas, Tex. and
David Carl Kahn of Lexington;
a daughter, Alyson Lynne Kahn
of Lexington; and, a brother,
Carl J. Kahn of Lafayette, La.

Kahn was born May 21, 1934,

 

in New Orleans where he also
received both his
undergraduate and graduate
education at Tulane University.
He earned the _ bachelor’s
degree from Tulane in 1957 and
the masters of fine arts degree
in 1959,

He taught for three years at
Delta State University in
Cleveland, Miss., prior to join-
ing Washington and Lee’s facul-
ty in 1965 as instructor in fine
arts and director of the univer-
sity’s Troubadour Theatre.

In his capacity as director of
the theatre, Kahn was chiefly
responsible for building W&L’s
strong theatre arts program.
He directed numerous plays,

 

starting with a 1965 production
of “Waiting for Godot.’’ Kahn
gained the reputation for not on-

ly producing plays of con-
sistently high quality but also
for selecting very significant
plays. Under Kahn’s direction,
for instance, W&L’s University
Theatre presented ‘‘Equus”’ in
1974 before the play had opened
in New York.

Kahn spent the 1970-71
academic year in Spain where
he studied contemporary
Spanish theatre. He also con-
ducted several spring term
study abroad programs in
which students studied theatre

both in London and Florence.

In 1975, Kahn was elected ex-
ecutive vice president of the
board of the American
Academy of Dramatic Arts.

Lee Kahn, Builder Of Theater Program, Dies

‘In the 16 years that Lee was
here, he was instrumental in
producing a strong university
theatre program which tapped
the resources of the entire
university community,” said
William J. Watt, dean of the col-
lege at W&L. ‘“‘The plays that
Lee staged were not only en-
joyable productions but also
served to educate the communi-
ty about the significance of
theatre in its many forms.”

The family has suggested that
instead of flowers, friends
might wish to _ consider
memorial contributions to
either the Lexington Rescue
Squad or Washington and Lee’s
theatre program.

EC Approves Changes
In Law School Elections

by Todd Smith

Amidst the confusion of Mon-

consideration of constitutional in-
terpretation, someone called for a
ruling from Robert’s Rules of
Order.

Bob Willis, “and I make the
rules.”

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team downed the
University of Baltimore 15-7
yesterday at Wilson Field. The
game marked the Generals’
. sixth consecutive win over
Baltimore.
The Generals struck hard and
early, building up a 10-1 lead at
halftime. Baltimore came back

with six goals in the second half,
but it was too little, too late for
the SuperBees.

Standouts for W&L included
Geoff Brent, who scored three
goals; George Santos, Mike

representation. At stake was
the constitutionality of the mo-
tion for September elections,
which was finally passed over
the votes of Willis, Vice Presi-
dent Willie Mackie, Secretary
Bud White and freshman Ben
Hale.

The constitution was written
when the law students and the
undergraduates used the same
calendar. Now, however, the
law school starts in mid-August,
almost a month before
undergraduates.

Edwards voiced “great con-
cern” that should a law student
be charged with an honor viola-
tion, the EC would have only
one law school member (there
is one representative for both
second and third year classes).

“I don’t see just flying in the
face of the constitution like
this,’ commented Mackie.

Dining Hall.

Pusey was recipient of two
awards, the first was a new
award honoring outstanding
faeulty members. It was
presented by the EC, and will
become an annual award bear-
ing Pusey’s name. Pusey’s se-
cond award came fron the Ring-

their individual contributions to
the university. They included

KA Fined, Penalized
By IFC. Judicial Board

The judicial board of the
Interfraternity council met
Tuesday night to settle a
dispute involving members of
the Lambda Chi Alpha and the
Kappa Alpha fraternities.
Throughout the winter term,
members of the two fraternities
have traded bottle throwing in-
cidents and several fights have
erupted.

On return from spring break,
the window breaking and bottle
smashing continued.

Last Wednesday night, the
police were summoned by
Lambda Chi on reports that
several KA’s were breaking
their windows. Preston Moore,
KA president, denied the
charge and stressed the need
for clarification of such allega-
tions.

The police were again sum-
moned by Lambda Chi on Fri-
day night. They reported that
several KA’s had burned that
fraternity’s initials onto the
Lambda Chi front lawn. Subse-
quently, a fight broke out bet-
ween two members of Lambda
Chi and several members of KA
that the police dispersed.

The police were summoned to

Lambda Chi a third time on
Saturday night, after hearing
that a KA had broken several
more of their windows. Preston
Moore stressed that only a few
members of his house were
responsible for these incidents.

Moore went on to say that
those individuals responsible
were reprimanded and fined by
the fraternity. He also offered
to have the damage repaired by
those involved.

After a_ fifteen minute
deliberation, the judicial board
decided to fine KA $150 and
place them on conduct proba-
tion for the remainder of the
term. Conduct probation is the
equivalent of a severe warning.

If the fraternity in question
commits another offense, it will
then be placed on social proba-
tion for the remainder of the
school year. The KA’s were also

Mellvain Exhibition Tours

Works by Isabel Mcllvain,
sculptor-in-residence at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, are currently included in two
major exhibitions and will
soon be part of a third exhibi-
tion which will travel in Europe.

One of Mcllvain’s recent
sculptures, ‘Standing Female
Figure,” is part of the in-
augural exhibition for the San
Antonio Museum of Art in San
Antonio, Texas.

The exhibition, which opened
March 1, is entitled ‘Real,
Really Real, Super Real: Direc-
tors in Contemporary American
Realism” and includes works
by such artists as Andrew
Wyeth, George Segal and
Richard Estes. The exhibition
will close in San Antonio on
April 26 and then begin a three-
city tour. It will be shown at the
Indianapolis (Ind.) Museum of

Art from May 19 through June
28, at the Tucson (Ariz.)
Museum of Art from July 19
through August 26, and at the
Carnegie Institute Museum of
Art in Pittsburgh from October
24 through January 3, 1982.

Another of Mcllvain’s
sculptures is in a traveling ex-
hibition organized by New
York’s Pratt Institute. Shown at
the Pratt Manhattan Center
Gallery last November, the ex-
hibition, ‘Sculpture in the 70s:
The Figure,’’ will be at Arizona
State University in Tempe,
Ariz., and at Dartmouth College
Museum and Galleries later
this year.

Mclivain, assistant professor
of art at W&L, is also one of four
sculptors whose works are in-
cluded in a book by Frank
Goodyear, curator of the Penn-

WLUR Radiothon

WLUR-FM, the broadcasting
service of Washington and Lee
University, will sponsor a fifty-
hour radiothon starting at 6:00
pm, Friday, May 8, and continu-
ing through to 8:00 pm on Sun-
day the 10th. The marathon,
non-stop broadcast will benefit
the Rockbridge Area Relief
Association (RARA), an af-
filiated agency of the United
Way. RARA provides emergen-

cy loans and _ financial
assistance for Rockbridge
County residents who are

underprivileged or are faced
with sudden, catastrophic ex-
penses, from fires in the home
to the need for a tow-truck.
During the radiothon, the
team of Eric Fife and Steve
Warren will remain on the air
playing selections requested by
‘ donors., The, format will remain

essentially the same as for most
weekends on WLUR: jazz, the
Metropolitain Opera, and Third
Ear. However, requests will be
entertained from callers who
make pledges to RARA, and
prizes will be auctioned off by
Fife, Warren, and such special
guests as other WLUR radio
personalities and officers of the
charity.

In weeks to come, workers for
the station and the United Way
agency will contact local
businesses, citizens, and frater-
nity houses to request pledges
for the marathon broadcast.
Special prizes will be given the
five highest donors; pledges
can be made now through the
station and RARA canvassers,
or during the radiothon itself by
calling the station at 463-9126.

also be part of an exhibition to
accompany the book. That ex-
hibition will travel in Europe
later this year.

A member of the Washington
and Lee faculty since 1975,
Mcllvain has had seven one-
woman shows including a 1977
exhibition at Gallery 4 x 10 in
New York. Her figures have
also been shown in many
galleries and museums and are
included in numerous public
and private collections.

Spring
Weekend
Sprung

by M. Shaw Pyle

You may not have known, but
a major part of W&L’s annual
Spring Weekend has already
come and gone. The Thursday
night of Fancy Dress was the
evening of the John Prine
concert, an event the cost of
which was a major factor in the
SAB’s contracting of an $8,000
Fancy Debt. Consequently, this
year’s Spring Weekend will be a
very laid-back affair. Friday
night will see another class
grain party, and Saturday will
be left free except for the
lacrosse game and a party in
the gym parking lot immediate-
ly following, with Southern rock
specialists the Ray Pitman
Band. There will be no SAB
films during Spring Weekend,
but the weekend of the 8th will
be set aside for a Woody Allen
filmfest. For further details of
Spring Weekend ’81, see the

_ schedule of events on this page.

Film Notes

Pirosmani (USSR, 1971) A W&L Film Society presentation, this
Soviet ‘great poetic biography’ is a tribute to the cunning of direc-
tor Georgi Shengelaya. Somehow, from the state-inspired
mediocrity of all post-Eisenstein film, a minor masterpiece. Friday
and Saturday, May 1 and 2, in classroom ‘A’ of Lewis Hall; 8 pm;
free of charge.

The Rules of the Game: (France, 1939) More Renoir. This time, a
film from that dreamy era between Munich and the start of the Se-
cond World War. Distressed by the appeasement in the
bourgeoisie’s mind, Renoir directed his own script of comic class
conflict to point up their failure. He became the most detested man
an France for his pains, and saw this, his last French film, canned
by a government fearful for ‘morale’ (read its own self-respect).
Thursday. Reid 203, free.

Blood Beach: Just when you thought it was safe to go back into
the theatre...here comes another dollop of gore. If you want an ex-
cuse to hold hands with your latest while she screams herself silly,
this one’s for you. Or, if you’re lonely and miss the beach, knock
back a cold six, round up the guys, and head for the movie house;
this is a great film to be snide about with the gang. At the Lyric ’til
tonight.

The Competition: Class struggle and Steinways in Old Moskva,
with heaping spoonfuls of saccharine and tears. The film stars
Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving as the starcrossed pianists (both
apparently made of cardboard). Bring Kleenex: the gals will be
sniffling and you'll need something to laugh (or lose lunch) in.
Through Thursday at the State.

The Conflict: Omen III: And you always knew politics was hell.
Eerie music, heavy evil, power politics, and eye of newt are the
main ingredients for the conclusion of the Omen trilogy. Whatever
floats your boat....At the Lyric, beginning Friday.

Hardly Working: hardly works. Jerry Lewis is running a little
low on cash, I guess, so he’s making a profit by making an ass of
himself on screen — again. A tired goulash of gags masquerading
as a film. Ten and under, maybe? Starts Friday at the State.

and in Buena Vista...

Any Which Way You Can: Apparently the title refers to what
Eastwood will do nowadays For A Few Dollars More. A delightful
and intellectually stimulating film about an orangutan who voices
social concern by defecating in police cars. But I guess it sells pop-

corn, At Cinema One.

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team broke ahead
from seven tied-scores to edge
Washington College 15-14 last
Saturday. The victory raised
the Generals to a 12th-place na-
tional Division I ranking.

The Shoremen scored first,
before the Generals tallied five
straight for their largest lead.
Washington, though, battled for
a 5-5 deadlock, whereupon
seniors Geoff Brent and George
Santos scored to give W&L a 7-5
halftime edge.

The Generals went ahead 8-5
early in the third period, only to
watch the Shoremen knot the
game at 8. Deadlocks occurred
at 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14, with W&L
pulling ahead each time. The
game-winner, an unassisted

score by junior midfielder Bob
Carpenter, came with 4:57 left
_to play.

Santos, and junior Mike Schuler
tallied twice each, while junior
Rob Staugaitis handed out five
assists.: Santos received the
team’s Player-of-the-Game
laurel.

The Generals conclude their
home schedule on May 2, when
they take on Roanoke College at
2:00 p.m. The Maroons, who
hold an 8-3 record after a 20-13
loss to North Carolina, are
ranked fourth in this week’s
Division III poll.

‘“‘We’ve responded well on our
home field this season, so we
look for two good outings this
week,’’ begins ninth-year head

coach Jack Emmer, referring —

to the team’s 3-1 home record,
the sole loss a strong 9-6 show-
ing against Virginia.

“Roanoke is a competitive
club with a lot of scoring abili-
ty; hence, our contest may have

  

Jack Emmer listened to referee’s explanation.

‘Washington proved itself to
be a fine offensive team,’’ Em-
mer offered. ‘‘Fortunately, we
thought they’d be capable of
such scoring, so we simply tried
our best to stay ehead and not
get behind.”

Senior midfielder John Kemp
and sophomore attackman
Geoff Wood scored three times
each to pace W&L, which gain-
ed its fourth straight win over
Washington College. Brent,

a tendency to develop into a
shooting match. Our series has
been a well-fought one in the
past, and Saturday’s game
should be another emotional
contest.’”’

W&L leads the series with
Roanoke 10-2-0. Last spring in
Salem, the Generals tallied ten
consecutive goals during the se-
cond and third quarters on the
way toa 15-6 victory.

Generals Lose ODAC,

by John Harrison

After reaching a milestone
last week by qualifying for the
0.D.A.C. tournament, the W&L
baseball team will be going
after an even more significant
milestone this Saturday when
the Generals take on_ the
hapless VMI Keydets. Should
the Generals win both games of
the scheduled doubleheader, it
would be the first time since
1948 that a W&L baseball team
has won twelve games; this
year’s team is 10-12. The last
winning team was the 1972
squad, which posted an 11-10
mark.

Since the Keydets are a lowly
1-30, W&L’s chances of finishing
.500 look very good. On the other
hand, if the Generals drop both
games (as they did last year), it
would be a rough conclusion toa
season in which the team had
hopes of finishing with a win-
ning record.

In last Saturday’s semi-final
game with Lynchburg, W&L
played its best game of the
three which have been played
between the two schools this
year. After losing to the Hornets
during the regular season by
scores of 11-2 and 24-4, the
Generals scored four runs in the
top half of the first inning, and
were as Close as 8-6 after 7-1 in-
nings, before they lost 14-7. Lyn-
chburg’s Dave Smith, the
ODAC’s top pitcher with a 7-0
record and 1.48 ERA, threw a
complete game. Offensive stars
for LC were Chip Childress (2
hits, 4 RBI), and Wayne Har-

rison (3-5, 3 RBI). First
baseman Jeff Haggerty drove
in three runs for W&L.

The Generals could find some
consolation in the tournament,

 

al

in that Bridgewater could fare
no better against LC in the
championship game. The 12-3
victory allowed the Hornets to
capture their ninth consecutive
20-win season.

The Generals seemed to have
suffered a letdown after the
tournament in its final home
games this past Monday and
Tuesday, against Newport
News Apprentice and
Longwood College. With the
Generals going through the mo-
tions against both teams, who
interestingly enough have iden-
tical 23-12 records, the out-
comes were predictable.

Against Apprentice, W&L
yielded 20 hits, including 5 home

runs and 6 errors en route toa ~
15-8 defeat. The pitching and
defense improved slightly, but
the hitters did not capitalize ina
14-3 loss to Longwood.

The Generals did have
several bright spots during the
two games. Catcher Tripp
Brower drove in 3 runs against
Newport News, and was very
effective at blocking many
potential wild pitches, as he has
been all season. Rightfielder
Jim Daly had four hits in the
two games, and southpaw Mar-
ty Thomas, making his pitching
debut after months of arm trou-
ble, was outstanding on the
mound. He allowed only one run
in six innings of relief.

Golfers Boast Undefeated Record

by Scott Mason

Under the exemplary leader-
ship of Coach Buck Leslie, the
undefeated Washington and Lee
golf team won three times last
week, boosting their record to
10-0. With only two matches re-
maining, the prospect of an
undefeated season is very
realistic.

Last Thursday, the Generals
hosted Radford College in a
match which saw junior Del
Agnew lead the way for the
eventual W&L victory. Agnew
finishe. the day with a total
stroke score of 73, followed by
junior Jim Kaplan and senior
Gerry Barousse, with 75’s.
Junior co-captain Bill Alfano
finished fourth among the
Generals with an 80. The team

won the match with relative
ease, and the final score was
Washington and Lee 303, Rad-
ford 335.

The following day, the
Generals met with equal suc-
cess by downing Hampden-
Sydney and Bluefield Colleges
in a windswept match. This
time, Barousse led W&L golfers
by amassing a score of 75, quite

impressive under such condi-
tions. He was followed by
Agnew, Kaplan, and Alfano,
respectively. The team had lit-
tle difficulty, and came away
with a final score of 397 to
Hampden-Sydney’s 416 and
Bluefield’s 474

The Generals were not yet
finished. Last Monday, the

team travelled to Princeton,
West Virginia and defeated
Bridgewater College and, once
again, Bluefield College.
Freshman Bruce Blythe finish-
ed the day with a_ stroke
average of 75, with teammates
Steve Everett, Gerry Barousse,
and Jim Kaplan all following
close behind. :

On Tuesday, May 5, the golf
team will attempt to achieve
that undefeated season which
they so arduously seek by tak-
ing on Randolph-Macon and
Bridgewater colleges. Both
Leslie and his team are confi-
dent and optimistic, and with
luck, the undefeated season
which just one month ago ap-
peared a mere hope may now
become a reality.

netmen placed third in the Fifth
Annual ODAC Tennis Cham-
pionships, held at W&L April
24-25.

W&L could claim only one in-
dividual champion, while win-
ner Hampden-Sydney had five
individual winners and runner-
up Lynchburg three. W&L’s
senior co-captain, Doug Gaker,
true to his first-place seed at se-
cond singles, cruised through
two opponents on his way to a
6-4, 6-2 victory in the final over
Lynchburg’s Kevin Record.

The Generals had men in the
finals at four different positions
during the tourney, yet only
Gaker could claim his title.

W&L sophomore Steve Denny
made it all the way to the finals
of the third singles before fall-
ing to Blitz James of Hampden-
Sydney, 6-3, 6-4.

In doubles, Gaker teamed
with classmate Pete Lovell for
a second-place finish at first
doubles, falling to Scott Good-
man and Worth Remick of
Hampden-Sydney, 6-2, 6-2.
Likewise, Denny and junior
Wes Yonge succumbed in the

finals of their second doubles
flight to the H-S team of Jim
Cain and Angus McCauley, 7-5,
4-6, 6-4.

‘Three Generals took third
place in their singles brackets;
Lovell at first singles, and
freshmen Scott Berman and
Charles Kalocsay at fifth and
sixth singles, respectively.

Overall, Hampden-Sydney
finished with 62 points, followed
by Lynchburg with 58 and W&L
with 57.

The Generals resumed match
play last Monday with a 9-0 loss
to the Division I University of
Virginia on the opponent’s
home court. Standout perfor-
mances were turned in by Ber-
man, who lost a tough fifth
singles match 2-6, 6-0, 6-3, and
the first doubles team of Gaker
and Lovell, who fell 6-3, 4-6, 7-6
(5-4).

W&L will compete in the W&L
Invitational, to be held May 1-2,
and then take to the road to face
Radford University on May 4.
The Generals close out their
season with a home match
against Virginia Tech, May 8.

Boston Marathon Attracts W&L Runners

by Ralph Frasca

“When I reached the finish
ine, I felt a tremendous ex-
ilaration. I said to myself, ‘It’s
00 bad I’ll have to wait another
65 days to compete again.”
Obviously, Geology professor
‘red Schwab enjoyed his par-
icipation in the Boston
farathon, the annual, 26-mile
oad race. Other members of
1e Washington and Lee com-
iunity who participated in the
‘adition-laden event were
‘nancial Aid Director Mike
artini, and law school students
lave Engel and Dean Greer.
Held April 5, the Boston
[arathon is the only race which
2quires that participants post
qualifying time (dependent
pon one’s age group) in a
revious marathon to qualify
1em for admission into the
eld.

Schwab, age 41, is the veteran
' the foursome, this having
een his fourth Boston
(arathon. Schwab’s time was 2
durs, 57 minutes, and he finish-
1 ‘around 3000th’’ in a field of
yproximately 6800 runners. He
yted, ‘‘with the imposition of
lalifying times, you would
link that there would be fewer
inners. However, that isn’t the
ise. If anything, the field has
creased.’’ Schwab added,

“the qualifying times do ensure
that the runners are of a high
caliber.”

Mike Bartini completed the
road race in 2 hours, 37 minutes,
placing 690th. Like Schwab,
Bartini is no stranger to The
Marathon, having run it in 1979.

“My goal was to run it (the
Marathon) in 2:30 to 2:40,
preferably towards the former.
Although I’m not especially
pleased with my time of 2:37,
I’m satisfied. I did beat my 1979
time by a full 5 minutes,
though.”’

Third-year law student Dave
Engel is a relative newcomer to
distance running.

“T ran a little in high school,
but gave it up entirely in col-
lege,”’ he recalled. ‘‘A friend got
me to take it up again here at
W&L, and I caught ‘Running
Fever.’ ”

Engel, who ran the 26 miles in
3 hours and 5 minutes, stated,
“It was unlike anything I had
ever experienced. The spec-
tators were very supportive.
They were forever offering us
encouragement. A_ runner
couldn’t have asked for a better
crowd.”’

Bartini echoed Engel’s sen-
timents..

“The crowd was full of fun
people. Instead of going to the

 

Professor Schwab training for
marathon.

beach or a ballgame, they came
out to see the Boston
Marathon.”

The undisputed star of the
W&L contingent was Dean
Greer, a second-year law stu-

dent who placed 174th, with a

time of 2:26.

Several criticisms were of-
fered by the W&L runners.

“T felt that there was too
much commercialism surroun-
ding the event,’’ Engel opined.
“There were T-shirt, shoe, and
running magazine exhibitions,
demonstrating the ‘proper
technique,’ and informing
everyone of the only ‘accep-
table’ T-shirt to wear.”’

Schwab added, “The mile
markers were not very visible.
Since most runners pace
themselves according to the
distance they have remaining,
the markers should have been
easily noticeable.

‘‘However,” he said, ‘“‘the
most important change needed
is that female competitors
should be made torun topless.’’

A virtually unavoidable pro-
blem at all races is the
prescence of ‘‘unofficial’’ run-
ners, people who did not qualify
to run, but nonetheless want the
thrill of competing in the na-
tion’s most prestigious
marathon. Thus, they jump out
of the crowd and join the pack.

“There were some oddball
unofficials,’”’ Schwab related.
“One guy ran the whole race in
a Superman outfit, complete
with cape. Another one ran
wearing a buffalo head, while a
third ran all 26 miles in a ballet
tutu. There is even a guy who

every year runs the entire
course backwards. I hear he
gets a lot of neck pains.”’
Despite scattered criticism of
relatively minor aspects, all the
W&L runners came away with
only good feelings about the
race and the people involved.

“There is a tremendous feel-
ing of camaraderie which ex-
ists,’ Engel said. ‘‘You are in a
large crowd of runners, where
everyone is willing to help
everyone else. There is no
pressure when you are in a
crowd, because there’s always
someone to run with.”’

Schwab observed, “‘To run in
the Boston Marathon is a big
ego trip, and lots of fun. It sure
was more enjoyable than giving
a Mineralogy lecture.”’

Each of the four runners in-
tends to compete in next year’s
Boston Marathon. It seems that
running that famous course
gives them a special feeling, to
be experienced only once a

year. Perhaps the candid
Schwab summed it up best
when he said, ‘‘After the sense
of elation I experienced when I
completed the Boston
Marathon, it’s tough to readjust

_to life as a mild-mannered

Geology professor.”

W&L Third In Track Championship

by John Cleghorn
Last Saturday, April 25, the
ashington and Lee track and
‘Id team participated in the
inual ODAC championship at
‘idgewater College. At the end
the day, Bridgewater emerg-
| as the outdoor champion by a
ide margin, followed by
mchburg in second place and
&L in a close third. With this
lish Bridgewater continued
sir dominance of the Old

minion Athletic Conference, ‘

nning this year by an im-
essive 70 points.

‘We ran about as well as we
ld,” said head coach Norris

dridge. ‘It was tough
cause this was the
idgewater Coach’s last

)AC championship, and there
re a lot of alumni there in
sport. . Consequently, the
idgewater team was very
ed up for the meet.”’

Auch of Bridgewater’s suc-
is can be attributed to one
m member. Duane Harrison
ced first in two running
nts and three field events,
ere he tied the conference
‘ord in the long jump. ‘‘He’s
outstanding athlete,’”’ com-

mented Aldridge, ‘I’m just
glad he’s a senior.”’
In other field action,

Washington and Lee’s Gene
Fellin finished as the ODAC
pole vault champion. Fellin was
impressive in his victory, com-
ing off a badly turned ankle the
day before the meet. In addition
to winning the ODAC, Fellin’s
vault also broke the school
record which had been held
since 1954. Coach Aldridge
maintained that Fellin

“could’ve gone higher.’’ Eric
Nelson threw his best in the
discus, placing second in the
conference behind
Bridgewater’s Harrison, who
also won the high jump in addi-
tion to the long jump. John
McKee and Charlie Alcorn plac-
ed second and fourth in the shot
put, respectively, which was
won by Bridgewater.

In the running events,
freshman Keith Kadesky plac-

ed third in the 100-meter dash.
R.J. Scaggs finished third in the
400-meter, and Alan Armitage
also took third in the 110 high
hurdles, a race won by
Bridgewater’s standout, Har-
rison. Scaggs also took third

and W&L’s Billy Morris fourth
in the 440-spring relay. Paul
Chapman placed third in the

880. In the distance events,
freshman Angus McBride
finished a strong second in the

1600, and the W&L mile relay
team comprised of R,J. Scaggs,
Billy Morris, Keith Kadesky,
and Paul Chapman took second,
witha time of 3:29.51.

When asked about the season
overall, coach Aldridge noted
several bad breaks. ‘‘The last
meet we had was on April 30th.
When we came back from
break, the meet with Lyn-
chburg was cancelled. So, we
went into ODAC having run our

factor was the weather,
Aldridge remarked. ‘‘We
haven’t had good weather all
year long. The ODAC was the
same way. It was cold and win-
dy, so it was difficult to deter-
mine our progress.”’

Coach Aldridge was not mak-
ing excuses, though, and is op-
timistic about next year. ‘“‘The
outlook is encouraging. This
team only graduates four
seniors, leaving a very young
and talented team.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Constitutional Chaos

Monday night’s EC meeting witnessed a great

 

 

Shoe Meets M. inks. i

Y/

FE
ip

debate over the constitutionality of a motion, pro-
posed by Senior Law Representitive Jeff Edwards, to
move the Freshman Law representative elections
from October to September. Although the motion
eventually passed, it did so only after drawn-out
disputes over the problems and possible repercus-
sions of altering the constitution without an amend-
ment approved by the student body.

The question at issue should not be whether to
adhere to the letter of the constitution, or to modify it
for the sake of practicality. Rather, the issue of con-
stitutionality must consider the intent of the framers
when it was written.

Looking back to that time, we see that both law and
undergraduate divisions followed concurrent calen-
dars. However, today this is no longer the case, with
the law school beginning almost an entire month
earlier than the undergrads.

It seems apparent that the constituion stipulated
the third week of October for EC elections to allow
freshmen of both schools time to adjust to their new
environments. It is extremely doubtful, at least in the
opinion of this newspaper, that there was anything
sacred or magical about elections in that third week.

Therefore to insist that elections take place at that
exact time is entirely missing the intent of that the
framers envisioned for the constitution.

Willis, Mackie and others who fear that this inter-
pretation of the constitution may be potentially
dangerous need not worry. The Ring-tum Phi is
always near, and we watch the EC’s every move.

The EC is commended for passage of this important
motion. It is always a good thing when justice tri-
umphs over mere law.

POINT/

COUNTERPOINT

 

 

POINT
By John Vlahoplus

y Mobil Oil, in a series of thinly
veiled parables, has undertaken
a major new media campaign
to push the traditional big
business — small government
view of economic organization.
The Grace Company is selfless-
ly and patriotically supporting
the president’s tax program by
running full page ads in
newspapers and carrying on a

running feud with the
Washington Post over the ef-
fects of the proposal.

Some of Mobil’s efforts have
been rejected by the networks
as too controversial, but after a
decision hailed by the company
as a victory for free speech,
some of them are now being
allowed on the air during cer-
tain restricted hours. Perhaps
these ads have as yet reached
few people, but the conse-
quences of allowing them to be
carried are nonetheless great.

Applying the right of freedom
of speech to a corporation is an
affront to men, in whom alone
reside inalienable rights. Cor-
porations receive through
charters’ only _ privileges
granted at the discretion of
men. Allowing them the
privilege of political advertis-
ing concentrates political power
in the hands of a few, forces de
facto government subsidies of
corporate political messages,
and denies stockholders the
right to use their share of the
company’s profits to support
their particular political
causes.

Modern advertising requires
a great deal of money, far more
than the average political
organization has available dur-
ing any time but election years.
But multi-billion dollar corpora-
tions like Mobil and Grace have
readily available ad budgets
that allow a constant media
presence.

Even if a group with opposing
views receives ‘‘equal time’ to
respond, it is extremely doubt-
ful that it could raise the money
needed to produce and run a
commercial. A concentration of
money leads to a concentration
of power, and at present very
few corporations control a
dominant share of the nation’s
wealth. But corporate political
ads do more than create a
dangerous concentration of
power — they also force those
who hold different political
views to help pay for the ads.

The corporations involved of
course deduct their advertising
costs as expenses. This allows
them to write off almost half of
the cost of the ads from their
tax bills. The effect is that the
government loses revenues,
and it (read you and I) sub-

sidizes the political opinions of
the members of the boards of
directors of those major cor-
porations.

When I see a Grace ad implor-
ing us all to be patriotic and get
behind President Reagan’s tax
plan I get an irritated and
helpless feeling knowing that
almost half of the cost of that ad
is being borne by the federal
government itself. This is an in-
direct way of forcing others to
subsidize controversial political
positions. The corporations in-
volved also directly force some
to ‘subsidize their political
advertising.

The people affected in this
case are, of course, the real
owners of the corporation — the
stockholders. The profits of
these firms belong to them, not
to some executive who wants to
preach laissez-faire. These peo-
ple have the right to receive
their dividends and to then
spend them as they see fit.

 
    
 
   

If they want to contribute toa
political party or a political ac-
tion committee so be it. But let
them “vote” in the political
market with their dollars just
as much as they “vote” in the
goods and services market with
those same dollars.

The corporate structure is in-
herently unfit for fair competi-
tion in the arena of political
advertising. A  corporation’s
owners are many with no prac-
tical control over the advertis-
ing policies of the firm. The
companies enjoy limited liabili-

vty, a grant of special privilege

not enjoyed by other
polemicists. We saw the abuses
that occurred with corporate
bribes and ‘“‘campaign contribu-
tions’”’ in the past two decades.
We needn’t allow much the
same thing to happen again.
Corporate privileges can
—and in this case must — be

reined in in the interests of
political freedom. Mobil’s ads
may seem cute and harmless,
but they still carry a controver-
sial political viewpoint — and I
(and many stockholders and
other taxpayers) resent having
to help pay for them.

COUNTERPOINT
By Kevin Dwyer

 

Major American corporations
like Mobil Oil, Smith/Kline
Pharmaceuticals, and W.R.
Grace and Co. have become
more highly visible on the
American scene than before;
certainly part of the reason for
this has been the increase in the
number of ads run by these cor-
porations. Ads for products are
not new.

The which

ads find

themselves in controversy are

 

Fwy

ads. Some are alarmed by these
ads, and Mr. Vlahoplus_ has.
summarized some of the wor-
ries in his piece. Unfortunately
these lucidly-stated proposals
do not survive close scrutiny.

Vlahoplus makes three major
complaints with regard to the
ads. First, that they improperly
concentrate ‘‘political power in
the hands of a few.”’ Second, he
frets that current law “forces
de facto government subsidies
of corporate political
messages.”’

Finally, Mr. Vlahoplus claims
that such ads_ deny
“stockholders the right to use
their share of the company’s
profits to support their par-
ticular political causes.’’ Let us
address these issues in their
course.

First, these ads do no such
thing as concentrate political
power in the hands of a few.

           

U(L(\

The Ring-tum Phi,-April 30, 1981; Page 7

 

the self-promotion or so-called
(see Mr. Vlahoplus) “‘political”’
vocating its interests. As a ma-
jor taxpaying entity, surely this
corporation should be permit-
ted to express its opinion on an
issue of national concern,
especially one which so vitally
impacts upon itself!

An analogy I believe to be
valid follows:

1. Grace sees Reaganomics in
its own best interest.

2. Procter and Gamble sees
increased sales of Crest in its
own best interest.

3. Both corporations produce
advertising designed to sway
public support and opinion:
Grace in the direction of
Reaganomics, Procter and
Gamble in Crest’s direction,
away from, let’s say, Colgate.

But wait, you cry. Dwyer’s
admitted Grace is trying to
sway public opinion; isn’t this a
concentration of political power

hd, Ili

in the hands of a few? I would
have to answer ‘“‘no,’’ especially
in light of the largely anti-
business attitude of the media
in recent years.

Far more people hear the
“scandalous and obscene”’ pro-
fits story than see Mobil’s ads.
If anything, the broadening of
the rights of corporation to
advertise in this way will help
keep in balance the “‘business-
is-bad”’ philosophy rampant in
media, academia, and the
popular mind.

Business pay taxes, they
should be able to speak out. Ex-
tension of free speech to oor-
porations is ‘‘an affront to
men”? Why? Is it because cor-
porations are wealthy institu-
tions, not people with limited
Corporate campaign contribu-
tions are expressly forbidden;
all W.R. Grace wants to do is

show that it believes that the:

The Legitimacy Of Corporate
Financing Of Political Advertising

Reagan economic plan is a) the
best course for America and is
b) also the best course for the
well-being of W.R. Grace and
Co.

This campaign is no mad
power grab; W.R. Grace is ad-
resources? If so, then the
churches and the labor unions ;
also wealthy institutions, not in-
dividuals, must be similarly
“reined in.”’

Would Mr. Vlahoplus agree? I
doubt it. Perhaps he just
mistrusts American corpora-
tions...I’m sorry, but that is an
inadequate reason to limit free
speech.

The other two charges are
easily dismissed if one accords
corporations the right to speak
out. On government subsidies:
If W.R. Grace, Smith/Kline,
Rockwell International, United
States Steel, et al, do not pro-
duce (in many cases) a Crest,
Clorox, Kleenex or other readi-
ly available consumer product,
such advertising is an excellent
means of obtaining public good
will.

Procter and Gamble can do it
with a product like Crest;
Rockwell cannot. It produces
the space shuttle, hardly a con-
sumer item. So it designs
patriotic ‘‘Congratulations,
America!” ads after the shut-
tle’s success. Why is this adver-
tising (or Mobil’s explaining its
profits, or Grace’s on
Reaganomics) somehow _in-

_ valid and therefore not entitled

to be considered deductible as
“expenses” like the ads for
Crest?

| Even if the so-called
“‘political”’ ads produce a shift
on an issue (Reaganomics,
shall we say), what is wrong
| with that? Grace advertising is
‘all business-related, even if on
| Reaganomics, and is therefore

legitimate ‘“‘expenses.”’

And, if W.R. Grace
stockholders disagree, they can
expel the board and chairman,
or force a binding policy vote at
a_ stockholders’ meeting to
change such ads, or abolish
them. This is done often and
successfully on questions of
trade (South Africa, communist
countries, etc.). So could it be
that stockholders in general
wholeheartedly concur?
Hmmm...

 

No one wants to return to the
abuses of the Nixon era with
regard to corporate involve-
ment in the political process.
But advertising by corporations
of this kind is not a step on the
way to that unhappy situation.
If subject to the same standards
of truth (i.e., no lying or libel,
etc.) of other advertising, this
phenomenon is just another
healthy expression of
America’s pluralism.

EC Debates Constitution Interpretations

(continued from page 1)
never ‘‘blatantly overturned”’
the constitution before.

“Do you want to weigh the
constitution, which isn’t follow-
ed anymore, against the rights
of law students?’ asked
president-elect Eric Myers.

“The constitution isn’t worth
the paper its printed on,” con-
tinued Myers, citing the office
of treasurer as an example of
the EC violating the letter of the
constitution. The EC has no
bonded, salaried treasurer,
despite Section XI, which sets
up the office. :

Actually, replied Willis, they

just “‘rubber-stamp’’ the
University’s choice of
treasurer. University

Treasurer Stewert Epley, and
assistant Louis Snyder, are the
bookkeepers for the EC.
Edwards’ first motion allow-
ed the first year law represen-
tative to stay in office until
replaced in October. When Law

Edwards next moved that
Section XI’s “The Executive
Committee shall provide for
other elections as become
necessary,” be interpreted as a
catch-all, including first year
law representative. The elec-
tions could thus be held in
September.

After Edwards noted that the
change would be subject to the
approval of next year’s EC, the
motion passed 6-4.

Mackie and others maintain-
ed that such an interpretation
was illegitimate. They noted the
clause preceding the special
elections clause, that said ‘‘the
general election for the
undergraduate freshman and
freshman law class shall be on
the third Monday in October...”’

“A constitution should trans-
cend time,” replied Edwards,
“and our constitution has failed
to do this. When the constitution
doesn’t apply, are we bound to
it?”

As the meeting closed,
Mackie declared that the pro-

A Ap an ent

ceedings were ‘‘void’’ because
the motion was out of order in
that the freshman law elections
were not special and the motion
thereby directly contravened
the constitution.

“Obviously the law students
don’t feel their rights are being
too grossly violated or they
would have turned out in higher
numbers for the referenda,”
Mackie said later.

On a university-wide ballot
last November was a constitu-
tional ammendment to move
the date of the freshman law
election up closer to the begin-
ning of the year. This and ten
other amendments were ap-
proved, but by only 22 percent
of the student body. The con-
stitution requires 50 percent for
passage.

Referendums have been held
several times this year to am-
mend and revise the outdated
and ambiguous sections of the
constitution. Despite their keep-
ing three to five polls open for
three days per referendum, the

students to vote.

“Changing the constitution by
committee,’ commented Willis
after the meeting, “‘erodes the
foundation of student
government—the students see
that it doesn’t matter whether
they vote or not.”’

“If you can’t convince the
students that (revising the con-
stitution) is a burning issue,
then I think you have to live
with the constitution the way it
is,’’ said Willis. ‘‘I have failed to
convince them; now it is up to
Eric’s committee.”’

Responding to criticism that
Edwards’ interpretation of the
special election clause was ab-
surd, Eric Myers said after the
meeting, “it may be an absurd
way (to interpret it), but it is a
practical way.

“In the short run, I think
motion will be in the best in-
terests of the law students,”
said Myers.

“At a time like’ this, the
students should realize they are
being penalized by their con-
Stitution,’” the junior EC
member concluded.

Fire Damages Pi Kappa Phi

by Tom Baker

A fire at the Pi Kappa Phi
fraternity house last Saturday
afternoon injured four firemen,
gutted the attic, and brought
water damage to the first and
second floors.

Two of the firemen passed out
due to excessive heat and
smoke inhalation, while the two
other firemen received minor
injuries while fighting the fire.

Clyde Harkrader, president
of Pi Kappa Phi, was not sure
how the fire started. He said on-
ly two fraternity members and
a band setting up for a party
that night were present when
the fire started at about 4:30
p.m. Harkrader was only cer-
tain that the fire started in the
attic.

As a result of the fire, most of
those living in the house have
moved into apartments with
other Pi Kappa Phis or into
university housing. Also, the
house’s electrical system was
burned out so the kitchen is
useless. They are now eating in
Evans Dining Hall.

Sophomore Steve Geary
credited Dean John and Gerald
Darrell, director of the univer-
sity food services, for their help
in promptly relocating frater-

nity members and setting up
their meal program. He said the
fraternity was thankful to the
Kerrs Creek, Buena Vista and
Lexington Fire Departments
and Buena Vista and Lexington
Rescue Squads for aiding in put-
ting out the fire.
The fraternity’s

company had not totalled the
damages to the house as of
Tuesday afternoon, but junior
Mark Altermatt said that a con-
tractor has been contacted and
repairs are expected to begin
‘Monday morning.

The Lexington Fire Depart-

ment is investigating the fire.

Committee Explores Learning Climate

“There is a general concern,”
explained Dr. Sidney Coulling,
“that the students fritter away a
lot of time, that they read with a
course outline but nothing more,
that there is a lack of intellectual
seriousness,
intellectual
students.”

By a majority of two to one,
the faculty began this academic
year by appointing an ad hoc
committee on liberal education.
As the year now closes, the
committee is preparing its
recommendations for the presi-
dent and faculty.

noted committeeman Dr.

‘We have seen something
here that’s noticed all over the

country,’’ explained Dr.
Leonard Jarrard, another
member of the committee.

“There seems to be a general
decline in writing skills, maybe
in reading skills, and in critical
thinking.”

‘About every ten years a
University should look over its
curriculum,” said Jarrard.
That is the reason for the com-

EC Given Final Draft
Of White Book Proposals

by W. Cope Moyers

In preparation for discussing
possible changes in the White
Book Thursday (today), the Ex-
ecutive Committee Monday
night received the final draft of
the proposed changes.

Senior EC representative Jim
Vines briefly outlined the new
revisions, which range from
simple changes in wording to a
complete rewriting of the in-
troduction and philosophy of the
honor system. Vines said most
of the proposed changes simply
consolidate the old wording.

“The changes basically
follow the same outline as the
current book,”’ Vines said.

Before anv changes to the
White Book can be im-
plemented, half of the Ex-
ecutive Committee first must
approve the changes, followed
later by a second vote. Two-
thirds of the committee must
then approve the changes on the
second vote. a
will begin deliberations on the
revisions Thursday afternoon,
with the possibility that
changes to the White Book
might, at that time, be im-
plemented.

In other business, the com-
mittee heard monthly financial
reports from the Student Bar

waeewrhd

Association and Ariel. Andrew
Trotter, co-editor of Ariel,
reported that the Spring edition
should be distributed during the
week before final exams. About
900 copies of the 32-page edition
are expected to be distributed
at a cost of $900.

Trotter also said the Publica-
tions Board will accept applica-
tions for editor of next year’s
Ariel until Friday.

Hop Xing of the SBA reported
to the committee that about $775
remains in this year’s general
fund. Xing said that the SBA
final report will probably not
differ much from the May
report, and that money remain-
ing in some committees will be
credited to the general fund.

EC president Bob Willis an-
nounced the winners for next
year’s University Council. Mike
Singer is the sophomore repre-
sentative, John Buttarazzi is
the junior member, and Eric
Kolts the senior representative.
Remaining positions will be
decided in Thursday’s runoff.

Senior committee member
Marshall Clark suggested that
the EC send a letter to the Lex-
ington Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment thanking them for ex-
tinguishing Saturday’s fire at
the Pi Kappa Phi house.

Cartoonist MacNelly Speaks

by Todd Smith

“If you're going to be a
political cartoonist, you have to
be totally cynical,’ explained
Jeff MacNelly, speaking to a
crowded Lee Chapel Monday
night.

‘Tam just nasty.”

Cartoonist for the Richmond
News Leader, MacNelly led the

audience on a cartoon tour of

the Carter administration,
among other things, at the
Contact-sponsored lecture.

MacNelly is well-known for
his comic strip ‘“‘Shoe"’, about a
newspaper staff of birds. The 32
year-old cartoonist used an
overhead projector to show
some of his syndicated artwork
as well as draw Shoe and
‘‘Perfesser”’ on the spot.

“The Perfesser is more
autobiographical than any of
the characters,’ said MacNel-
ly. ‘He's sort of an aging prep-
pie.”

‘Nobody understands my
cartoons. I feel like I'm in a 20th
century literature course —
every once in a while someone
comes up to me and says, “I've
got it, the perfesser is Henrv
and the tree is

One of his cartoons depicted
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter
as the class dunces. “This car-

toon shows how well you can use
children to represent national
leaders, if you can’t find rep-
tiles touse.”’

‘IT don't think I was cut out for
this business,’ said the two-
time Pulitzer winner. ‘I don’t
go for the jugular."’

MacNelly cannot see himself
as a crusader, the whole world
of politics is just too
“hilarious.”

‘My job is to come up with
something more ridiculous than
reality.”’

Delts Placed On Social Pro By IFC

by Steve Perry

Delta Tau Delta was placed
on a mandatory two weeks
social probation by the IFC
Tuesday night, following a noise
violation conviction by the local
authorities.

On April 29, the Lexington
police filed a complaint stating
that the party at Delta Tau
Delta was too loud. The law
States that if amolified music
can be heard from a distance of
more than fifty feet, a noise
violation has been committed.

The police then arrested
Delta Tau Delta president, Rich
Silberstein, and proceeded to
break up the party.

IFC representative, Lou
Close, stated that the Delts
were charged’ with both com-
mitting a noise violation
and not having a noise permit.
He added that the Delts, and
any other fraternity were
unable to obtain a noise permit
because it was held on a
weeknight.

and a Delt member, stated that
three other fraternities were at
the party, and he did not think
that the Delts alone should be
held responsible for the noise
violation. Vetterlein added that
the police tested the house for a
possible noise violation from on-
ly 20 feet, instead of 50 feet as
the law requires.

Delta Tau Delta will appeal
the decision to the Student Af-
fairs Committee in hopes of
having the two weeks social
probation rescinded. Their ap-

peal is based on a precedent set
recently by Sigma Phi Epsilon,
which states that if a fraternity
has not been placed on social
probation for a long period of
time, they may attempt to have
the penalty lifted on the basis of
their good record.

Phi Delta Theta and Sigma
Nu were also given two weeks
social probation for failing their
house inspection. Phi Delta
Theta plans to appeal to the
SAC.

Film Notes

_ J vitelloni (Italy, 1953): A Federien Fellini film, winner of the
1953 Silver Lion of Venice, The Layabouts is a tale of youth on the
coast. In other words, an Italian beach bum film (imagine
Lifeguard with subtitles). Fellini claims it is a fun film with no
message; critics tend to find deep philosophical meaning in it.
Worth the time, though — especially with what’s in town. Thurs-
day, May 7th, Reid 203; free. Single showing, 8 pm.

Shoot the Piano Player (France, 1960): Francois Truffaut’s New
Wave film is a reaction against the Maltese Falcon type of detec-
tive and detective film. He calls it his ‘gangster fairy tale.’ French
singer Charles Aznavour stars. Tuesday, May 12th, 7 and 9 pm,
Reid 203. No charge.

Blazing Saddles : another madcap Mel Brooks film which we’ve

all seen and intend to see again. And again. The West was never
this Wild — but don’t you wish it was? Starts Friday at the Lyric.

Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Gore without Vidality. A schlock
horror film dredged from the cutting room floor. Tess is delayed
and this is the stopgap, which brings us to the question, ‘Must the

Spring
Parties
‘Planned

A succession of spring parties
is planned by ‘just about
everyone who can throw one
and has a reason — or an ex-
cuse. The result is likely to be
four Saturdays in a row that end
with a bang and four Sundays
devoted to whimpering.

The Cockpit will continue to
host ‘name’ bands and similar
SAB entertainment. But the in-
novative aspect of the term-
long party jokingly referred to
as ‘W&L Spring Semester’ is the
responsibility of the IFC and the
organizers of the upcoming
lacrosse rally that precedes this
week’s W&L - UNC clash.

The ‘Stomp the Heels’ party,
the main ingredients of which
are fifteen kegs of beer, many
decibels of taped music, and
school spirit (to: taste), is
scheduled for Saturday, May
9th, from 1:30 to 4:30 in the
afternoon.

The IFC-sponsored Fabulous
Thunderbirds concert is set for
Saturday the 15th from 4 to 7:30
p.m. The concert on the 15th is
to be held in the gym parking
lot, and it is suggested that you
not park there that day. The
concert schedule and an an-
nouncement of the special
guests likely to attend will be
printed in next week’s issue of
the Ring-tum Phi.

Finally, back at the Pit, the
All-Stars hit Big Lex on Thurs-
day, and May 13th sees rock and
roll from Creeds.

And if that’s not enough
partying for you, you know
where the brew stores are.

Dr. Pusey Retires After 42 Years

by David Ames

William Webb Pusey III, the
S. Blount Mason Jr. Professor
of German, recently honored at
the senior banquet with his
third Riag-tum Phi award and
the creation of a newly faculty
service award bearing his

name, will end his forty-two
year teaching career this
spring.

Over the years, Pusey has
served as chairman of the Ger-
man department, director of
the Chinese Studies Program,
dean of the College and acting
president (1967-68), in addition

to serving on numerous faculty
committees.

Despite his many activities, .

he has no doubts as to what his
most rewarding experience at
W&L has been: ‘teaching

students.”’ Pusey cites his prin-
cipal objective in teaching as

that ‘‘students learn and as far

as possible enjoy it (learning)
(but not vice versa ).”’

His enthusiasm for teaching
has only one reservation —
grading papers, a task “‘which
requires more willpower every
year.”

In addition to teaching, Pusey
is also proud of his scholarly
work and of the many ad-
vancements which were made
during his term in the ad-
ministration. When he came to
W&L in 1939, he was interested
in comparative literature. The
tide of world events, however,
led him to publish Readings in
Military German, a book which

enjoyed great popularity until |

the end of World War II.

After serving in the Navy dur-
ing WWII, Pusey returned to
W&L and focused his research
on American literature in Ger-
many. The late Ollinger Gren-

shaw, a former professor of
history at W&L, provoked
Pusey’s interest in what is his
current field of study, the in-
tellectual and social history of
this area. He has written
numerous articles including one
to appear in the upcoming issue
of the Rockbridge Historical
Society Proceedings.

Pusey likes the close relation-
ship between administration
and faculty members at W&L
that does not exist at colleges

that hire professional ad-

ministrators. He stresses that
all the accomplishments made
when he was part of the ad-
ministration were ‘cooperative
undertakings.”’ Those which he
is proudest of include the ap-
pointment and retention of
superior faculty members, the
expansion in the number of
courses offered, and the re-
vamping of the distribution re-
quirement system.

Pusey remained in the
classroom during his ad-
ministration years, teaching
elementary Russian. Since that
time he has taught mostly
elementary German, elemen-
tary Russian, and a com-
parative literature course.

Over the years, however, he
has taught every course offered
by the German department,
and was once even called on to
teach Norwegian, a language in
which he claims to have no pro-
ficiency. He managed, never-
theless, by. remaining one
lesson ahead of the student who
requested it.

In his forty-two years of
teaching at W&L, Pusey has not
observed any decline in student
intelligence. In fact, Pusey
believes that, while they may
not have as much specific
knowledge as students of the
past, students today possess a
better background. Whereas
there may be a decline in

knowledge of the English
language, he believes it is due to
lack of exposure and does not
fault the students.

In retirement, Pusey plans to
continue his research into local
history and to work part-time in
the library’s special collections.
He will also be able to spend
more time hiking, which he en-
joys. (He is trailmaster for the
Rockbridge Fox-Stick Hiking
Club). He will also continue his
work as one of the directors of
the local League of Women
Voters and plans to travel with
his wife.

Pusey is optimistic about the
future of W&L. He sees
“something special’ here at
W&L. He says, ‘‘Washington
and Lee, when I arrived in 1939,
was friendly, as it is now.’’ He
believes that W&L can and will
maintain its ‘air of civility”
and the harmonious relations
among admrnistration, faculty
and students which made it
prosper in the past and will
cause it to prosper in the future.
Pusey only has one regret — he
says that he will miss the
classroom. And sadly, the feel-
ing is mutual.

Curriculum Question Raised

(continued from page 1)
rard and Sessions, its members
include Dr. John Handleman,
Dr. Thomas Williams, and
students Winston Burks, Craig

Albanese, Howard Herndon,
Willie Mackie, and Frank
Williams.

Meeting almost every week,
the committee has addressed
several aspects of the intellec-
tual climate on campus, in and
out of the classroom:

Housing: do living §ar-
rangements contribute to the
“fragmentation” of the student
body, or to the isolation of non-
fraternity members?

Athletics: to what extent do
athletics enhance or encumber
a Student’s education?

Coeducation: is a_ sexually
diverse student body necessary
to the liberal education, and
does this University have a
healthy mix of race and creed,
in addition to sex?

Curriculum: are distribution
requirements adequate in
giving the students a broad
background?

The curriculum question is
closest to the main concern of

‘‘What
accor-

the committee, which is,
kind of school is this?’’
ding to Sessions.

‘“‘We ought to reevaluate the
way we're going,”’ stated Hern-
don. *‘Do we want to become
professionals in college, or gain
the broad base that lets us go in-
to anything?”’

“There is a general concern
that the students fritter away a
lot.of time,’ explained Coull-
ing to the Phi, “‘they read within
the course outlines, but nothing
more. There seems to be a lack
of intellectual seriousness,
almost an anti-intellectual at-

titude among students.
“By intellectual attitude I
don’t mean_ solemnity,

bookishness or pedantry, but
the real pleasure in education
for its own sake,”’ said Coulling.

“The chief problem is the
fragmentation of the student
body,”’ said the English depart-
ment head, who lamented the
lack of the ‘“‘unifying force that
was present in his days as an
undergraduate.

“I saw a first rate perfor-
mance at the University

theater was half-full — I call
that scandal!’’ Coulling con-
tinued, ‘‘There are more oppor-
tunities than ever. I will not
argue that the students are bet-
ter than they were, or that the
faculty and courses are better,
but the facilities have been im-
proved to such a degree that
they are unrecognizable from
what they were 25 years ago.

“T think the lack of common
pursuit among our students is
related to our fragmented socie-
ty, in some measure,” said
Coulling.

Sessions also sees unity as a
critical problem for the intellec-
tual climate of the atmosphere.
He noted that the purpose of the
University, spelled out in the
catalogue, includes stressing
the student’s ‘‘harmonious rela-
tionship with his fellow man,
and his responsibility to serve
society through the product of
his training and talent.”

The ‘payoff’ of general,
liberal education, according to
Sessions, is not a vocational
talent, but “‘the type of person
produced.”

“‘We don’t ask how all this fits
together, how does this con-
tribute to the public good?”’
noted Sessions.

“It is not the liberation of the
individual as an individual that
makes sense, but the liberation
of the individual in a communi-

ty.”

Sports

Rock, Smith

Named All

Washington & Lee University
freshman Tim Rock and Don
Smith, both residents of San An-
tonio, Texas, have received All-
America recognition from the
College Water Polo Coaches’
Association and from Water
Polo Review, the official
publication for United States
amateur water polo. They are
W&L's first All-America per-
formers in the sport.

Rock was named to the se-
cond team by each organiza-
tion. He finished the 1980 season
with 34 goals, third on the team.
In addition to the water polo
laurel, Rock earned All-
America recognition in swim-
ming by finishing fifth in the
1650-yard freestyle event at the
March, 1981 NCAA Division III
Championships. He is believed
to be W&L’s first athlete to earn
A-A recognition in two sports.

Smith was selected first-team
All-America by the Coaches’
Association and honorable men-
tion by Water Polo Review. He
recorded 29 goals last fall,
fourth on the varsity.

-American

“These awards will be
beneficial to Tom and Don as in-
dividuals and to our team as a
whole as we set goals for the
coming season,’ explained
head coach Page Remillard,
who this fall will enter his third
year as W&L aquatics director.
“Tim and Don would agree that
they have teammates worthy of
such awards, teammates who
may join them with awards in
the future.”

Prior to enrolling at W&L,
Rock and Smith played for
coaches George Block and Kurt
Swanson in San _ Antonio’s
Northside School District. “A
lot of what Tim and Don have
done at W&L thus far is due
chiefly to their development in
the San Antonio program,”’ of-
fered Remillard.

W&L finished the 1980 season
with a 17-14-0 record and a
sixth-place finish in the eight-
team Eastern Intercollegiate’
Championships. The 1981
schedule includes nine events,
four of which will take place in
W&L’s Cy Twombly pool.

Lewis Named Basketball
Assistant At GWU

by Ralph Frasca

Brad Lewis, a senior drama
major who served as_ Ad-
ministrative Assistant to W&L
basketball coach Verne Can-
field, was named Graduate
Assistant Coach with the
George Washington University
basketball team.

Lewis, from Washington,
D.C., was offered the job
several weeks ago by GWU
head coach Jerry Gimmelstob.
Gimmelstob was acting on the
advice of Red Auerbach, Presi-
dent and General Manager of
the Boston Celtics. Lewis
worked at Auerbach’s basket-
ball camp for the past two sum-
mers,

“It was because of Verne
Canfield’s influence that I
became’ interested in
coaching,” said Lewis. ‘‘I never
gave it a thought before I met
him.”

Lewis had applied for the
position of Graduate Assistant
at the University of Utah, the
University of Nevada-Reno, the
University of South Alabama,
and Davidson College before
landing the GWU post, and is
still under consideration at
those schools. However, Lewis
doubts that he will give up his
GWU assistantship, should any

Lax Team Nips Roanoke

Staging “the best comeback Re
I've ever been associated with”
according to head coach Jack
Emmer, the Washington and
Lee lacrosse team registered an

exciting 14-12 win over fourth- 4

ranked Division III power
Roanoke College last Saturday
on Wilson Field, before 4,143
fans. The victory, the team’s
third in a row, gave the
Generals a 6-3 record which
they take into a Sunday, May 19
contest in Chapel Hill against
the University of North
Carolina.

“You have to give credit to a

(a

 

,

“y @ ;

 

lot of inspired athletes for that Bigg

comeback,’ remarked Emmer
on the team’s fight from a 9-2
third-quarter deficit to an 11-9
fourth-quarter lead. ‘‘There
have been several times we
were down three or four goals
late in the game, but never by
seven goals, five minutes into
the third quarter. The last time
I saw a team do something
remotely similar was at
Cortland State, when we were
down 6-0 in the first quarter
against Cornell and wound up
winning 14-8.”

Roanoke’s 9-2 advantage
resulted from a 7-2 halftime
lead, created by good goaltend-
ing and fine attack play, mixed
with two scores early in the
third quarter. However, at that
point the Generals caught fire
to reel off nine unanswered
tallies -while holding the
Maroons scoreless for exactly
15 minutes.

Sen... .wiuiteider Geott Brent
started the burst, scoring three
straight goals to pull W&L up to
9-5. His efforts were followed by
scores from classmate John
Kemp, sophomore John Doub,
junior Mike Schuler, junior Rob
Staugaitis, Doub again, and
senior’ George Santos to give
W&L the 11-9 edge with 10:42
left.

The Maroons, though, caught
up at 11-11 midway through the
final quarter and again at 12-12
with 4’:43 left. But Brent, who
received the team’s Player-of-
the-Game honor, rose to the oc-
casion to score the game-
winner unassisted with 3:55
showing. Senior Jerry Broccoli
provided an insurance goal with
37 seconds left by stealing a

osike Schuler maneuvers against Roanoke.

“We needed some positive
things to happen against
Roanoke if we were to do a good
job against North Carolina and
then UMBC in our final
games,” offered Emmer. ‘““The
guys realized at halftime that it
would be a long two weeks if
they lost. For them to make the
comeback, even after Roanoke
scored twice to open the third
quarter, is a sign of positive
thinking.”’

In the match against North
Carolina, a 2:00 p.m. contest on
Fetzer Field, W&L will face a
Tar Heel squad which holds an
8-0 record and _ second-place
ranking in this week’s USILA
Division I coaches’ poll. The

 

 

of the aforementioned schools
offer him a job.

As Graduate Assistant, Lewis
will be in charge of keeping the
scouting and recruiting files up
to date, take part in active
scouting and recruiting, and
will sit on the team bench dur-
ing all games. As a _ bonus,
Lewis will be allowed to take
one graduate course at GWU
per semester, paid for by the
school.

Lewis plans to earn a
Master’s Degree in Health-
Physical Education, an impor-
tant step towards his goal,
becoming the head basketball
coach of a major college team.
‘It’s almost impossible to pro-
gress in the coaching field
without a Master’s,”’ Lewis
noted.

GWU is a member of the
Eastern Eight basketball con-
ference.

Track Men End Season
With Bridgewater Loss

by John M. Cleghorn

On Friday May list, a day
marked by the cool weather
which has become a regular
feature of Washington and Lee
track meets this year, the
Generals fell to ODAC cham-
pions Bridgewater in a dual
meet. Although the Generals
lost, 92-50, closing their season
with a 4-3 record, several
athletes set personal records.

On the track, freshman Kevin
Kadesky took first place in both
the 100 and 200-meter events,
setting times of 11.0 and 22.30
respectively. In the 200-meter,
Kadesky defeated the con-
ference champion established
last week at the ODAC finals. In
the 5000-meter, senior Howard
Herndon ran his best time of
17:10:5, taking third behind
Bridgewater’s Don Denlinger
and W&L’s John Kelefant.

In the field there were also
several personal firsts.
Sophomore pole vaulter Gene
Fellin continued his marked im-
provement by breaking the
school record which he had tied
last week. By vaulting a height
of thirteen feet and nine inches,
Fellin broke a record held for 27
years. Junior John McKee
launched his best shot, a
distance of 44 feet 9 inches,
beating the mark set by the con-
ference champ last week.
Charlie Alcorn also set personal
records in both the shot and the
discus. Alcorn placed second in
the discus with a throw of
117’’6’, and third in the shot,
reaching 40’’6-1 2’.

Head coach Norris Aldridge
sighted the contribution of
several seniors. ‘‘R.J. Scaggs
and Billy Morris have both
given us a lot of points over
their four years. Howard Hern-

don and John Schmidt have also
worked hard for us and both
recorded their best efforts in
the meet with Bridgewater.”

Assistant coach Frank
Miriello also offered remarks
about the accomplishments of
his weight event athletes.
Mariello cited two shot putters,
John McKee and Charlie
Alcorn. “John only started
throwing in January. He has the
tremendous strength, quickness
and basic ability to give him
potential.’’ McKee won the in-
door conference shot competi-
tion.

‘Alcorn made a good transi-
tion to the 16-pound shot and
shows great promise for his re-
maining three years.’’ Miriello
also noted Alcorn along with
sophomore Eric Nelson for a
good future in the discus. “Eric
threw his best in ODAC last
week. He has improved five feet
from last year and has the flex-
ibility and throwing style to
become a 200-foot thrower. Both
Alcorn and Nelson are potential
record holders for W&L.”’ Gene
Fellin was noted for his poten-
tial as a pole vaulter. ‘Gene
was coming off a badly broken
wrist this year and had to
regain his style. We hope he
qualifies for national competi-
tion,” remarked coach Miriello,
“he has the chance to become
one of the better vaulters in
Division III track.”

The Generals will graduate
only four seniors, and thus
return with a great deal of
talent. Under the coaching of
Aldridge and Miriello and the
leadership of captains Mark
Shaver, Russ Rector and Alan
Armatage, the Generals pro-
mise to be a challenging team
next season.

The Washington and Lee

baseball team concluding its
season by losing both games, of
a doubleheader against
.rosstown rival VMI, 8-7 and
11-10. What made the one-run
defeats that much harder for
the Generals to take is the fact
that’ the victories tripled. the
Keydets’ win total for the year.
The two wins gave VMI a 3-35
record, while the Generals
finished at 10-14.

John Friend’s RBI single end-
ed the Keydets’ 32-game losing
streak, while teammate Mike
Eden had seven hits in eight at-
bats on the day, the most

significant being a two-run

single in the bottom of the
seventh to tie the opener, after
W&L scored three in the top half
of the inning. Jeff Haggerty and
Chris Cavalline belted homers
for the Generals.

second game saw the Generals

lose a 6-0 lead. First-year head ~

coach Craig Jones, a VMI
graduate, offered these com-
ments on the doubleheader:
“The first game was truly nip-

Golfers End Season
Undefeated

The Washington an Lee
golfers, in their bid for an
undefeated season, travelled to
Ashland, Virginia Tuesday to
play Bridgewater and Randolf
-Macon colleges. At its conclu-
sion, the Generals found
themselves with twelve wins
and no losses on the season and
had captured the undefeated
record they had so conegly pur-
sued,

Jim Kaplan was medalist
with a stroke score of 74, while
senior co-captain Gerry
Barousse followed with a 76.
Junior co-captain Bill Alfano,
senior Steve Everett, and
freshman Bruce Blythe con-
tributed to the victory with
scores of 79, 80, and 82 respec-
tively.

Coach Buck Leslie was ob-
viously happy with the results.
“Those things don’t come too
often,’’ he remarked of the no

loss season record which the |

 

‘ senior

team compiled over the eight
week season.

Unfortunately the team failed
to gain a spot in the May 19
NCAA Division three champion-
ships. Upon special invitation
only the NCAA selection com-
mitee elected not to invite W&L
despite their twelve win, no loss
record. The chance to play in
the NCAA tournament was
something the Generals had
hoped for since the outset of the
season.

“The boys gave it a valiant
try,” said Leslie, and there still
remains a_ possibility that
co-captain Gerry
Barousse will be asked to play
as an individual member. In
any case with or without an
NCAA bid, the Washington and
Lee golf team has come a long
way. To put together an
undefeated record in any sport
is a remarkable feat, and one
which the Generals can be
proud of.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Grades, Girls
& Grad School

The intellectual atmosphere among students at
W&L is not what it has the potential to be. This is not
to say that students do not study. Most study very
hard. But there is a difference between our hard work
and our attitudes toward our work.

For many, our diligent study in the afternoon is
motivated by our desire to be ‘‘down the road”’ in the
evening. Our course selections are often based more
on the grades we hope to get, rather than on intellec-
tual challenge in order to improve ourselves.

And yet most of us came to W&L with high educa-
tional ideals and a sincere desire to learn. Unfor-
tunately, somewhere between orientation and
graduation we replace our desire to learn with a
desire to succeed.

This is understandable considering the competitive
nature and long tradition of success at W&L, but it is
not a fair exchange for our intellectual development.
The two can go together, but it takes a consciouis ef-
fort from the individual not to abandon one in favor of
the other.

Our four years at W&L should not merely be an
obstacle on the road to “better” things, but an oppor-
tunity to broaden our educational base. We need to
see our educational objectives in terms of developing
our minds, instead of just strengthening our GPAs.

If our objectives are only grades, girls and grad
schools, how can we hope to have a meaningful in-
tellectual experience? With our rising tuition costs,

we cannot afford to miss the educational oppor-
tunities W&L offers.

E.C. Interpretation Disputed

Dear Editor:

I write this letter in some
distress over the recent deci-
sion of the Executive Commit-
tee to forego the process of
amending the constitution, as
outlined in that document, in
favor of expediency. I refer to
the vote on law school elections
in which a majority of the E.C.
members voted to interpret a
section of the constitution in
what seems to have been bla-
tant disregard of a specific
clause within that document.
While I certainly empathize
with the E.C. members who are
so obviously frustrated by the
lack of student participation in
amendment votes taken in the

(ete eer

sy
re 7 d iat

~ a

  

penn
Sees, |

oe

past, I nonetheless believe that
it is an error to move in ways
which directly contravene the
constitution. Eric Myers is
quoted in the Phi as stating that
“The constitution isn’t worth
the paper it’s printed on.” If
this is true then why not
disregard the entire document
and rule by will...or by whim?

 
     

When I cast my ballot in any
election it is with the under-
standing that my duly elected
representatives will carry out
the duties of their office in obe-
dience to the constitution under
which they were elected to
serve. I still believe this to be
the case and encourage the E.C.
to reconsider its decision.

Let me just add in parting
that I greatly appreciate the
many long hours of selfless ser-
vice which the members of the
Executive Committee log in for
the benefit of the entire student —
body. Your time and your effort
are not in vain. Thanks.

Sincerely,
Keith E. Goretzka

Commentary By John Wells

Praise The Lord And Pass The Plate

How many of you out there in TV land find it dif-
ficult to choose between Carson, CBS movies and
rehashed ABC trash weeknights after 12? May I
suggest a new alternative (actually it isn’t new) at
this hour on channel 20, Monday through Friday,
the Fernwood 2nite of religious programming, the
PTL Club.

Please let me stress that I am not anti-religious
or anti-God, so I am not loath to criticize a pro-
gram which reduces Jesus to a painted lawn orna-
ment amid pink flamingoes and sea horse bird
baths. PTL, by the way, stands for Praise The
Lord.

The tone of the show is set at the beginning and
strangely resembles the opening of the Tonight
Show. The announcer, ‘‘Uncle’’ Henry Harrison,
reads over a drum roll and music ‘‘The PTL Net-
work is proud to present...Jim Bakkerrrrrrrrr!”’
as Jim and wife Tammy Faye walk onstage to
thunderous applause (the name of the show is no
longer officially “‘PTL”’ but ‘‘Jim Bakker’’).

Jim is not tall, pale, baby-faced with tip-tilted,
brown and most sincere eyes and a mouth that
looks like nothing as much as a monkey’s in a cer-
tain clinch. His hair is soft-looking and blown back
and he sports an impressive wardrobe of dacron
suits and sport coats. He looks like an aging altar
boy selling subscriptions. Actually, he makes a
never-ceasing sales pitch for PTL, his ministry
and the gospel.

By his side is the irrepressible Tammy Faye,
the pert gospel songtress from Minnesota with a
nasal twang. Tammy’s face is a _ burst of
brightness which may be attributed not to ra-
diance but rather a dense application of makeup.
Did I say dense? Well, I can’t decide if she looks
more like a circus clown or a truck stop waitress.

The color of her complexion ranges from show to
show; her mouth is painted jungle red far beyond
the boundaries of her actual lips; her eyes are
thickly lined to the point of resembling Cleopatra
(really) and the real eyebrows have been shaved
and new ones penciled in about an inch above the
originals.

A physical description does not do justice to this
enchanting woman, although it should be pointed
out that her parade of frocks has been a boon to the
women’s fashion division of K-mart. And while
we’re at it, her hairdo: it used to be enormous,
curly and immobile-looking. Now it’s short, black
and mousey brown (someone has advised her
about hairdos and hairdon’ts).

Following banter with the PTL orchestra leader
(no Carson drug jokes) is a monologue, which
usually includes ribbing Tammy (not physically)
about her weight problem; a cute and/or par-
ticularly touching letter to the couple leading to a
sermonic plea (demand?) for money and repen-
tance as Armageddon draws near.

Then the chit-chat begins in a semi-lavish off-
Williamsburg reproduction setting with tufted
velour wingbacks. I have reconstructed a typical
dialogue, with actual quotes from several shows,
to give you an idea of what it’s like. Jim’s in a
chair, Tammy and Uncle Henry on a couch.

(Most of what is printed below is taken directly
from past shows, many quotes are out of context
and some connecting dialogue has been made up
as representative of ordinary small talk on the
show. At least one quote was published last year in

Jim: Well, folks, the phones here at PTL have
been ‘“‘ringing off the hooks” as the old saying
goes. And all you folks at home have to do is pick

up your telephone and if you pledge $15 a month or
more (presumably until death), you’ll receive this
beautiful, big color book all about me, PTL and all
our friends. Now, I know some of you folks are
saying ‘Jim, I just can’t afford $15 a month!”
Well, I think you can.

Tammy: That’s right Jim, you know I had a gal
write a letter to me whose husband hated Chris-
tian programming and whenever it came on he’d
just blow up and go outside ’til one day she went to
the door and said, ‘‘Honey, c’mere, I think there’s
something on you’ll like,’’ and he came in and they
watched the show, and after it was over she said,
‘“‘Well?”’ and he said, ‘‘Well, I like that,” and it
was PTL! (applause) So she said, ‘‘Well, I’m glad
you like it, cause it’s only $15 a month!’’ and she
pledged! Isn’t that marvelous? Praise the Lord!

Jim: Praise God. And those of you who feel you
can’t pledge that $15 a month, a gift of $100 or
more will get you this full color PTL book.

Uncle Henry: Don’t forget about the $1000
pledge.

Jim: Yes, a pledge of $1000 or more will get you
the special edition vinyl-covered PTL bible — and
— this acrylic on velvet rendering of ‘“‘Jesus and
the Children.’’ Tammy and I take special pride in

 

Yl GS
S

the fact that our son, Jim Jr., was used as a model
for one of the children.

Tammy: That’s our little boy!

Jim: Now before I go into a detailed description
of the PTL book, I want to mention three other
items which may also be obtained for a monthly
pledge. First, there’s Tammy’s first album called
Tammy Faye that has ‘‘We’re Blessed”’ on it, then
there’s Tammy’s book, ‘‘I Gotta Be Me!,”’ a really
wonderful book...

Tammy: Thanks, honey.

Jim: And her newest record, called Tammy
Faye Bakker: The Lord is on My Side. Any of
those for a monthly pledge of $15 or more, friends,
PTL needs your money to stay on the air.

Tammy: Praise the Lord!

Uncle Henry: Amen, Jim, show them the book.

Jim: Well, here is the book that can be yours for

$15 pledge (displays book with full length picture
of Jim on the cover ). This is a beautiful book, have
you seen all the pictures? Look (camera close-up
of book): There’s Efrem Zimbalist, Jr...there’s
Pat Boone...there’s Roy Rogers and Dale
Evans...awww, looky there (close-up of Tammy
photo suggesting a cross between Lucy Ricardo
and Dr. Frank-n-furter)...and finally...(applause
erupts at Jim photo with high school senior infor-
mal picture-type scenic background). Well,
anyway, you folks at home will be proud to hang
these in your kitchen — or your barn (yuk yuk).
Well, I’ll bet Roy Rogers and Dale Evans wouldn't
mind being hung in the barn!

Tammy: I wouldn’t even mind if they hung me
in the barn!

Jim: That’s right! (laughter and scattered ap-
plause) Seriously, folks, we need your money to
keep PTL on the air and spread God’s word. We
want to make Him a part of your everyday life!

Tammy: Praise the Lord! You know Jim, when
you say everyday, I hope folks’ll listen, cause
Christ is with me everyday, everywhere! Why, I
even take him to the supermarket with me! I just

say, ‘Find mea bargain, Jesus!”’
* kK OK OK

The rest of the show contains ‘‘witnesses’* and
“testimony” by numerous guests, songs by the
PTL Choir (I have yet to hear my favorite
“religious pop” song heard once on the radio,
‘Jesus Was a Hell of a Man’) and more,
preaching. An _ uninterrupted hour’s worth,
sometimes two shows back to back.

The Bakkers seem to be unpolitical, at least
compared to the Rev. Jerry Falwell, but they like
to be associated with whoever happens to be presi-
dent. During the Carter administration, a solemn
Tammy sometimes appeared alone to announce
that Jim was breakfasting ‘‘at this very minute”’
with Jimmy in the White House. Since November,
however, Carter has been rarely, if ever, mention-
ed, and dusty photos of Jim with candidate Ronald
Reagan have been unearthed for inclusion in the
PTL book. Certainly, at least in style and deport-
ment, the Bakkers most nearly resemble the
Plains Gang.

On a spiritual level I can boast no high from the
proceedings as apparently hard core fans do. In-
tellectually, the level of the show speaks for itself
although one cannot underestimate the cunning of
Jim Bakker. He has taken a road show ministry
and transmuted it into a private TV network rival-
ing Jerry Falwell in. geographical scope and
influence. Hawking Jesus paintings does more
than keep Tammy in layers of Maybelline.

Well, obvioiusly, the show must be seen to be ap-
preciated. I’ve tried to separate the concepts of
God and Jim and attack only the preacher,
although I’m sure if he could read this Jim would
classify me as an instrument of Satan. I laugh at
the show, and if I feel badly about it, it’s not
because I think they don’t deserve it. Perhaps I
shouldn’t find humor in cheapening the image of
Christ, which is what PTL, intentionally or not, is
all about, in my opinion.

Washington and Lee University

Colvin Awarded
NATO Fellowship

Dr. Milton Colvin, professor
of politics at Washington and
Lee University, has received a
research fellowship from the
North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).

Colvin is one of only five
Americans receiving NATO

grants. There were 25
fellowships awarded world-
wide.

Announcement of the
fellowship was made by Dr.
Joseph M.A.H. Luns, secretary-
general of NATO.

The aim of

the NATO

  

Dr. Milton Colvin
Research Fellowships is to pro-
mote research leading to
publication of studies which ex-
amine aspects of common in-
terests, traditions, and outlook
of the 15 nations that belong to
the NATO alliance.

Each NATO Fellow receives
a grant to support his study,
which must be undertaken in a
NATO country other than the
Fellow’s home country.

Colvin will conduct his

 

research in Germany. His topic
is ‘“The Pursuit of Detente in
East-West Relations: The Im-
pact of ‘Finlandisation’ on the
Young in Germany.” According
to Colvin, ‘‘Finlandisation’”’ is
the growing movement among
German youth to take a neutral
stance for Germany outside the
NATO alliance, thus giving the
country more flexibility in
East-West relations. Colvin will
travel throughout Germany and
will work in several cities, in-
cluding Berlin, Hamburg,
Heidelburg, Munich, Stuttgart,
and Cologne.

A graduate of Yale University
with a Ph.D. from the Universi-
ty of Heidelberg (Germany),
Colvin has been a member of
the Washington and Lee faculty
since 1961. He taught previously
at the University of Montana,
Vanderbilt University, and the
University of Chicago. He has
held visiting professorships or
research fellowships at the Na-
tional War College, the Univer-
sity of Vienna (Austria), and
Oxford University.

Colvin has contributed ar-
ticles or monographs to the
‘Yale Review,”’ the ‘‘American
Journal of Sociology,’’
‘Military Review,’’ and
“Smithsonian Studies.’’ He has
been a member of several
boards, commissions, and
organizations, among them the
Yale Alumni Board, the Yale
Scholarship Committee, the
Virginia Wilderness Commit-
tee, the Sierra Club, and the
American Political Science
Association.

Ex-Criminal Enthralls Audience

by Scott Mason

He’s been called The Great Imposter, The
Skywayman. He's served as an airline pilot, a doc-
tor, a lawyer, and a professor all between the ages
of 16 and 21. He’s forged phony checks in over 26
countries and became a millionaire by the time he
was 19. His name is Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., alias
Frank Williams, alias Robert Conrad, alias Frank
Adams, alias Robert Monjo, and is, almost
without question, the greatest con man ever.

The phenomenal story of Frank Abagnale was
revealed last night to a captivated audience in Lee
Chapel. Born in Westchester County, New York,
Abagnale left home at the age of 16 and began his
fascinating career as a con man. With a genius
1.Q. of 140 and having a photographic memory,
Abagnale became a Pan American airline pilot at
the age of only 16. In a clever, swindling story,
Abagnale served for two years as a pilot, flying
over three million miles for free while cashing

Frank W. Abagnale, Jr.

At 18 years of age Abagnaie moved to Atlanta,
Georgia where he posed as a doctor. By the time
he left Atlanta he had served as a distinguished
chief resident of one of the city’s finest hospitals
while possessing no medical background what-
soever.

Abagnale later became an assistant to the Loui-
siana District Attorney after having successfully
passed the bar exam, Only after he had served as
a professor of philosophy at Brigham-Young
University, had stolen thousands of dollars in
deposits from Boston’s Logan airport, and had
cashed hordes of Pan Am payroll checks did FBI
agents have a clue as to Abagnale’s identity.

Finally caught at the age of 21, Abagnale was
sent to serve in a French prison. In a barbaric ac-
count of his six month sentence in a five by five
cell, Abagnale suffered a tremendous physical
and mental deterioration as a result of total isola-
tion.

Sent to serve in Sweden and later a New York
prison, Abagnale repeatedly escaped from

Fabulous FabulousT- hirds

Within the confines of the
music of the 80’s, the title of the
Fabulous Thunderbirds’ second
album is most assuredly a dou-
ble entendre. Their music is
“The Last Word.”’ As guitarist
Jimmie Vaughn puts it,
“Everything except for the
music is beside the point.”’

The Thunderbirds play
rhythm and blues, pure and
Review:

simple. They have been
together as the Fabulous
Thunderbirds for the past three
years. The story goes that Jim-
mie Vaughn was playing in a
bar in his home town of Austin,
when Kim Wilson asked if he
could sit in. Vaughn said ‘‘No”
but Wilson hopped up onstage
anyway and promptly blew the
harp player in the band off-

stage. That was that. At
Vaughn’s_ insistence, Wilson
packed his things and moved to
Austin.

Shortly thereafter, bassist
Keith Ferguson, who was work-
ing in a Mexican band, and
drummer Mike Buck joined up.
Corny as_ it sounds, the
chemistry was there. The

“Diamond Studs,”’ a musical
about the life of infamous bank
robber and folklore hero Jesse
James, will be presented by the
Washington and Lee University
Theatre on May 22-24 and May
27-29 at 8:00 P.M. in Lexington’s
Troubadour Theatre.

Directed by drama professor
Al Gordon, ‘Diamond Studs”
consists of scenes from Jesse’s
life, from the time he joins
“Quantrill’s Raiders” in the
Confederate Army through his
death.

fiance of a state law mandating
that the creation story and only
the story of creation be taught
in class. The prairie populist
and perennial presidential can-
didate William Jennings Bryan
took on the task of prosecuting
the hapless educator. Clarence
Darrow appeared for the
defense, and a cause celebre was’
launched in every paper in the
country.

Inherit the Wind follows the
trial in all its stages. Brad
Lewis’ adaptation, which in-
cludes only the court room
scenes, is a lot tighter than the

original play, which sows
almost as much wind as it
reaps

Reduced to these bare essen-
tials, the play becomes a debate
between the fundamentalist -
Brady (Bryan) and the agnostic !
Drummond (Darrow) on the
evolutionary theories of Charles
Darwin rather than on the law
itself. In the final analysis, the
question addressed is: ‘Is it con-
stitutional to think?’

The debate that attempts to
answer this fundamental pro-
blem turns on the right of the
majority, of Brady and his
followers, to prohibit a freedom
of expression that offends them,
that threatens their faith or
their prejudice: the tyranny of
the majority. It is, like Shaw, a
battle of words.

Consequently, it is imperative
that the lines flow, that no splut-
tering, no marble-mouthing oc-
cur. Sad to say, this was not the

case Wednesday night. Even
taking the opening night jitter
quota into account, Ralph
Frasca as Brady, Boy Orator of
the Platte, stammered and
splutter more than his righteous
indignation called for, and Todd
‘Minks’ Smith ran a close se-
cond as Henry Drummond. The
rest of the cast was also prone
to the sporadic stumble, but not
more so than the opening night
atmosphere would excuse; and
besides, it is in the speeches of
the antagonists, Brady and
Drummond, that the real
showdown comes, and it is ther
that clarity is so essential. I
might add in passing that
Ginger McNeese was good as
gold in this, as in every,
respect: in one speech there
were five stammers, true, but
each of her stammers were call-
ed for in the script.

Aside from this important but
hardly paramount cavil, the
rest of the play went relatively
well. Frasca is, I must confess,
a little hard to believe as, the
Prophet from Nebraska,’ but
Todd Smith was letter-perfect
in his acidulated liberal
enlightenment, Mark Smith
was quite good as the cynical
journalist Hornbeck, and
Ginger McNeese was typically
professional as the
schoolmarm. The cast as a
whole, in fact, was quite
capable.

And oh, yes, the set was real
nice, courtesy of the Court. All
in all, not a bad thirty minutes.

Lacrosse Team Loses To UNC, 18-9,

Elimated From Tournament Consideration

When it rained, it poured.
Literally.

Midway through the third
quarter of Washington and
Lee’s lacrosse game last Sun-
day afternoon against the
University of North Carolina,
the overcast skies let loose with
a downpour. Up to that point,
the Generals were having
enough trouble with a shower of
shots from the number-two
ranked Tar Heels. An additional

shower simply added insult to -

the injury of an 18-9 loss.
“They were worthy of the

fashion by turning away 22 in
the form of saves. ‘‘22 saves is
simply a helluva good day,”’
Emmer said.

The first quarter ended in a
2-2 deadlock, after the hosts had
held leads of 1-0 and 2-1. In the
second period, though, North
Carolina broke loose to outscore
the visitors 9-2. The Tar Heels
then increased their advantage
by scoring the first three goals
of the third quarter.

‘‘We’re not upset with our ef-
fort. Our players performed
well from an offensive stand-

Wood paced the W&L offense by
netting three goals. Senior mid-
fielder Geoff Brent and
sophomore midfielder John
Doub added two each. Junior
defensemen Dave Nickels
received the team’s Player-of-
the-Game honors.

W&L now looks to shower
upon UMBC, which stands 7-3.
“They’ve made the transition
from Division II, where they
won the national lacrosse title
last spring, to Division I, and
made it well,’ commented Em-
mer on the Retrievers, who

“They have an abundant
amount of offensive ability in
the form of two strong midfield
units, and an attack as potent as
exists anywhere.’’ The offense
is keyed by a group of seniors:
midfielder Craig Linthicum, at-
tackman Jay Robertson, and
midfielder attackman Marty
Cloud.

Saturday’s contest will be the
fourth meeting of the teams.
The last battle, a 16-7 W&L deci-
sion, took place on March 25,
1972 on Wilson Field.

 

 

Set For
May 21

The Washington and Lee
University department of
athletics will hold its annual All-
Sports Awards Ceremony on
Thursday, May 21 at 5:00 on
Wilson Field.

The department will present
its three major honors: the
Preston R. Brown Memorial
Award to the most valuable
senior athlete; the Wink
Glasgow Spirit and Sports-
manship Award; and the
outstanding freshman award.
The department will also pre-
sent special recognition awards
to eight friends and supporters
of W&L athletics.

In addition to the depart-
ment’s presentations, each of
the University’s 13 varsity
sports will announce their in-
dividual award recipients.
Seniors who participated for
four years in a sport will
receive lifetime W&L athletic
event passes.

University Athletic Director
Bill McHenry will provide the
Ceremony’s welcome. Presi-

Senior Golfer

Washington and Lee senior
Gerry Barousse, from New
Orleans, La., will represent the
University at the seventh an-
nual NCAA Division III Golf
Championships, set for Tuesday
through Friday, May 19-22, in
Pinehurst, N:C.

Barousse will make his third
appearance in the NCAA event.
In 1977 he was a member of the
W&L team which placed
seventh in the competition, held
in Gambier, Ohio. In 1979, he
earned All-America honors by
placing in a tie for 11th place in-
dividually . while leading the
Generals to an 11th-place team
showing in the tournament, held
in Richmond, Va.

Barousse served as _ co-
captain with junior Bill Alfano
for this spring’s W&L team,
which finished with a perfect
12-0 record under head coach
Buck Leslie. Despite the team’s

undefeated season, the NCAA
selection committee did not in-
vite the Generals to participate
in the Division III champion-
ships.

The Generals finished their
season on Tuesday, May 5 by

“Everybody had a hand in

remarked Leslie, who now has
seven winning marks in his
seven years as W&L coach.
Barousse paced the team in
four of the season’s ten events,
and earned All-Conference
honors when he led W&L to se-
cond place at the April 20 Old

Jim Kaplan top man in one, and
freshman Bruce Blythe the
leader in another. In addition,

Barousse and Agnew teamed to °

In the NCAA Championships,
Barousse will be one of three in-

Leslie Has High Hopes
For Golf Team Next Year

by Scott Mason

During the course of roughly
two months, the Washington
and Lee golf team has put
together a perfect 12-0 record
under the helm of coach Buck
Leslie and captains Gerry
Barousse and Bill Alfano. ‘‘We
met a couple of our goals,”
remarked Leslie, somewhat
disappointed that the team was
not selected to compete in nhe
NCAA Division III Champion-
in Greensboro, North

Carolina. Team leader and
senior co-captain Gerry
Barousse was, however, chosen
to represent W&L as an in-
dividual player. The four day
tournament begins Tuesday,
May 19.

The key to the Generals’ suc-
cess, it seems, rested in the
depth and balance among the
team players. In addition to
Alfano and Barousse, Steve
Everett, Del Agnew, Jim
Kaplan, and Bruce Blythe all

contributed to the team’s
undefeated season.
Although the loss of

graduating seniors Barousse
and Everett may somewhat

hinder the Generals, next
year’s team, nonetheless,
“looks fairly strong,’ says

Leslie. Based upon incoming
freshmen, the team can only
hope for a season as equally
successful as this year’s has
proven.

 

 

Soccer Team Looks Ahead

by John M. Cleghorn

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team will complete their
spring practice this week and
show great promise for the up-
coming season. What was one of
the campus’ strongest teams
this year has developed and
matured to pose even more of a
threat next year.

The team started the prac-
tices May fourth and will wind

them up this week. The practice
is not one of strenuous work

or strict conditioning but rather
one that gives coach Rolf Piran-
ian a chance to start moulding
and adjusting his players for
next fall. ‘‘The spring isn’t in-
tended to get players in shape
but to evaluate their different
skills at different positions,”’
remarks Piranian. The players
did drills and scrimmaged in
the afternoon sessions which in-
cluded a game against an alum-
ni team last Saturday. The
Generals beat the alumni early

The Generals of 1980
registered a 9-4 mark missing
an NCAA bid by virtually one
game. The team only graduates
five playing seniors and returns
the bulk -of its talent in
freshmen and sophomores. The
largest losses, coach Piranian
comments, will be in the
goalkeeper and the center mid-
fielder positions. Keeper Kevin
Carney and midfielder Brian
Williams leave the Generals but
their places will be aptly filled
by Ben Muskin and Curt Mant-
zer.

W&L will face a_ tougher
schedule next year adding the
challenge of the University of
Richmond and the University of
Virginia. Messiah College and
Haverford College are two
strong division three teams that
will also be added. ‘“‘It’s a
tougher schedule,” says Rolf,
‘but it gives us a better chance
in the NCAA’s because we
knock heads with real division
three powerhouses.’

Cuts will be made this spring
to reduce the squad to 22 and
final cuts will leave the roster at
20 next fall. The Generals will
open their schedule the 16th of
September against Mary Wash-
ington after a short ten days of
preparation. ‘‘We’re hoping to
have a good group of freshmen
next year,’ commented coach
Piranian, ‘‘It’s possible that one
or two might be able to help us
out on the varsity.’’ Two former
players will also return next
year, Billy Brown and Joe Or-
dinez, who both started for the
Generals before taking off a
year. “That's a real positive
note for us to have that ex-

perience coming _ back,”’
remarked Piranian.
‘We have more talent on

campus now than any other
time that I have been here,”
fifth year head coach Piranian
states. “I am very optimistic
that this will be a team that the
school can be proud of.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Better Late
Than Never

During the past week, the Executive Committee
has held three long meetings in an effort to revise and
update the White Book, the most important set of
rules governing W&L students. Although it is a
monumental task, the committee’s efforts have been
outstanding. The overhauling and fine tuning that
needed to be done years ago on the Honor System is
finally getting done.

All the revisions in the ‘‘new’’ White Book are still
subject to final Executive Committee approval, but
there is little doubt that all will get the necessary two-
thirds vote when the time comes. These changes, first
proposed by a subcommittee of university ad-
ministrators and EC members, have in the past week
faced even closer scrutiny by the committee.

Some of the changes are simple corrections in
grammar, replacing words like ‘‘feel’’ with ‘‘thinks.”’
But some of the revisions are significant, including
replacing the old book with two new ones. The first of
these new books outlines the basic philosophy and en-
forcement of the Honor System, and the second book
details procedural matters and the rights of the ac-
cused. The EC believes two books will appeal more to
incoming freshmen and prospective students, and the
committee is right.

The only disturbing aspect of the committee’s ef-
forts has nothing to do with any of the proposed
changes, but that the committee waited too long
before discussing them. Six members were absent
from the last meeting and not once has the entire
committee been present at any one of the meetings.
Law representatives Mike Nogay and Jeff Edwards
are taking final exams, and the senior EC members
are busy with post-graduate plans. Input is needed
from all 12 members sitting around the table at the
same time, but unfortunately they all cannot get
together.

Progress has been made however, and final action
on the revisions is not far down the road. The EC
should be commended for tackling this issue. In the
future, the 1980-81 Executive Committee will best be
remembered for its work on the White Book, which
was better late than never.

Academic Notice

The Committee on the current Spring Term.

Automatic Rule will meet at
10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, June 9,

The Committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement

1981. At that time the Commit-
tee will consider whether or not
to reinstate immediately the
following groups of students
who have fallen under the
Automatic Rule:

1. those students completing a
full academic year who failed to
meet the cumulative average
required of their class;

2. those students not com-
pleting a full academic year
who failed to meet the condi-
tions of Academic Probation re-
quired of them by the end of the

all students who fall under the
Automatic Rule. If any student
wishes to inform the Committee
of any extenuating cir-
cumstances, he may write a let-
ter to the Committee and
deliver it to the Office of the
Dean of the College before June
9.

A student who falls under the
Automatic Rule severs his con-
nection with the University. If
the Committee does not grant
him immediate reinstatement
(reinstatement is the exception
rather than the rule), he may

apply for reinstatement after a
minimum of one year. As soon
as possible after the Commit-
tee’s meeting, each student fall-
ing under the Automatic Rule
will receive a letter explaining
his status. His parents will
receive a copy of that letter.

ACADEMIC PROBATION

Any student who fails to
achieve the cumulative average
required for his class but who is
not subject to the Automatic
Rule in June because he does
not complete a full academic
year then will be on Academic
Probation for the Fall Term. He
and his parents will be notified
of his status.

Th siseiler birds

(continued from page 3)

Thunderbirds began doing the
grueling rounds of one-night
stands around Texas. Word got
around quickly. It wasn’t long
before people like Bob Dylan,
Eric Clapton, Dickie Betts,
Delbert McClinton and Elvis
Costello were showing up at the
Thunderbirds’ gigs.

The group, in support of their
debut album, toured the U.S. for
three months, supporting the
likes of John Prine, and Asleep
at The Wheel. They recently
completed a highly touted Euro-
pean tour with Dave Edmunds
and Nick Lowe’s Rockpile.

When asked about influences,
Jimmie Vaughn shuffles his
feet, but finally admits to cut-
ting his teeth on the likes of T-
Bone Walker, Lightning
Hopkins, Magic Sam, and Fred-
die King. Questioned about his
style, Vaughn grows more in-
tense: “I don’t believe in the
concept of lead guitar....1 just
play guitar.’”’ Indeed, Jimmie
plays both the chords and the
melody — at the same time.

In Texas, Jimmie Vaughn
had been a teenage legend. At
age sixteen, he was headlining
with his high-powered lead
guitar stylings. He later
foresook the high energy and
volume, and returned to his

roots, that pure, unadulterated.

rhythm and blues guitar.

Kim Wilson says that he stole
something from every harp
player that he ever listened to,
though a primary influence was
George ‘Harmonica’ Smith,
one of the instrument’s unsung
heroes. Yet Kim’s style is his
own; he can make a six dollar

marine band sound like an en-
tire horn section.

The Fabulous Thunderbirds’
first album was on the Takoma
Label. What was in the grooves
was identical to what they’d
been doing on the bar circuit.
Now, with ‘“‘What’s the Word?”
they’re stretching out a bit. No,

Business Societies
Initiate Twelve

Several students, alumni, and
faculty members of Washington
and Lee University were in-
ducted into two honor societies,
Beta Gamma Sigma and
Omicron Delta Epsilon, during
ceremonies on the campus May
ts

Initiates into Beta Gamma
Sigma, which recognizes
outstanding achievement in the
study of business administra-
tion, were: W. David Jones,
assistant professor of ad-
ministration; Marshall A,
Clark, a senior from Memphis,
Tenn.; Stanley K. Doobin, a
senior from Rock Hill, N.Y.;
Brian J. Noonan, a junior from
Charlotte, N.Ci: = and. J.
Franklin Williams, a junior
from Danville, Va.

Initiates for Omicron Delta
Epsilon, which recognizes
outstanding achievement in
economics, were: Carl P.
Kaiser, assistant professor of
economics; and_ seniors
Lawrence G. Davis, of Wil-
mington, Del., Charles T. Ham-
mes of Boone’s Mill, Va., Ted
M. Kerr Jr. of Midland, Texas,
and Jerrell G. Nickerson oi
Hopewell, Va.

In addition, two alumni were
inductees into Omicron Delta
Epsilon. H. Reed Johnston, a
1928 graduate who is a founding
partner of Johnston & Lunger, a
New York brokerage firm, and
his son, William R. Johnston, a
1961 graduate who is chairman
of Agora Securities Co.

 

this isn’t a ‘‘new and different”’
Thunderbirds, just a little more
of their own material. And
there’s enough vintage rhythm
and blues here to keep the most
fanatical purist pacified —tunes
like ‘Juke Boy Bonner’s Run-
nin’ Shoes” and Lazy Lester’s
“Sugar Coated Love.’’ On ‘‘Last
Call for Alcohol,’’ Kim shows
his chromatic harp chops, and
with “Extra Jimmies,”’ you get
to hear Mr. Vaughn strut his
stuff. Then there’s ‘‘Los
Fabuloso Thunderbirds’: close
your eyes here and listen to the
sounds of Mexican radio.

  

Despite the air of good-timey
fun about it all, at the bottom
the Thunderbirds are the
quintessential ‘‘serious’’
musical journeymen. We’ !
leave the last word to Jimmie
Vaughn: ‘‘The best music —I’m
talkin’ about real hillbilly, sw-
ing, cajun, Tex-Mex, and of
course, the blues — has been
made by people who never
studied music. You don’t need
to analyze it or study it or talk
about it. You just know that it
makes you feel..." Vaughn
Stops to search for a phrase.
‘*...that it moves you.’’ Enough
said.

custody, and is the only man ever to have escaped
from the Atlanta Federal Penitentary.

Somewhat ironically, Abagnale now heads a
company aimed towards security and the preven-
tion of crime. The firm grosses over $10 million a
year and develops material used by over 17,000 in-
stitutions.

The long-running television series ‘It Takes A
Thief’ starring Robert Wagner is based on
Abagnale’s life. Abagnale has made numerous ap-
pearances on Johnny Carson’s The Tonight Show
and on M*A*S*H. “Catch Me If You Can,”
Abagnale’s remarkable autobiography, sold over

100,000 copies in the first 21 days of its publication
and has remained on the national bestseller list for
seven months. A motion picture portraying
Abagnale’s life is soon to be released with actors
Dustin Hoffman, Alan Alda, and Katherine Ross
all taking leading roles.

The life of Frank Abagnale is an utterly
fascinating tale. Yet, says Abagnale, his career as
a con man wasn’t worth it. Now at the age of 33, he
looks back on his youth with some remorse. ‘‘I’ll
never know what it’s like to be 16,’ remarks
Abagnale. ‘‘Life is a very beautiful thing, but life
is very short. Please don’t grow up too fast.
Everyone has the right to his youth.”

Grant Received For

udio-Visual Center

A grant of $120,000 from the
funds of The Pew Memorial
Trust of Philadelphia, Pa., has
been made to Washington and
Lee University to help fund an
audio-visual center for the
university’s new undergraduate
library.

Announcement of the grant
was made by Washington and
Lee president Robert E.R.
Huntley.

Once completed, the library’s
audio-visual center will include

a modern, multi-purpose
system that will be used
throughout the campus.

The university’s $9 million
library, formally dedicated last
May, contains a 1,500 square
foot area that was architec-
turally designed to become an
audio-visual center.

Preliminary plans call for a
small video system to be
located in the center, providing
video materials to four seminar
rooms and two. conference

rooms located in the library and
equipped with video monitors.

In announcing the Pew
Memorial Trust grant, Huntley
noted that “the systematic
development of our audio-visual
capabilities has been a growing
need in recent years. This
assistance from the Pew
Memorial Trust will have a far-
reaching and gratifying effect
on many academic programs
where teaching effectiveness
can be enhanced by modern
technology andresources.”” —

The Pew Memorial Trust is
the second largest foundation in
the United States in size of
assets. It was set up by Joseph
N. Pew Jr., J. Howard Pew,
Mary Ethel Pew, and Mabel
Pew Myrin in memory of their
father and mother.

The $120,000 grant helps to
make possible one of the
specific needs in the universi-
ty’s $62 million development
program toward which $56
million has already been com-
mitted.

 

EC Assessment By Cope Moyers

Progress Made
Through Diligence

Future Executive Commit-
tees should take a hard look at
the efforts of Bob Willis & Co.
There is much to learn from the
outstanding if not sometimes
unusual job this year’s Ex-
ecutive Committee did.

It is indeed possible to come
to gripswith a complex and
crucial university matter, as
the EC demonstrated with its
handling of the White Book revi-
sions. Undoubtedly, the new
changes and clarifications im-
plemented by the EC have
strengthened the university’s
most important set of rules.
Next year’s committee should
remember this: nothing’s im-
possible.

But future Executive Com-
mittees should also remember
that as the year progresses, and
October. turns to May, it
becomes more difficult to
resolve important issues. Im-
portant matters, whenever
possible, must be handled and
resolved before the end of the
year.

Thus, when future EC’s
search for inspiration and in-
sight, they can remember that
this year’s committee rewrote
the White Book, even though at

times half its members were
absent. Indeed, the work got
done, but it was completed
without the benefit of input
from Jeff Edwards and Mike
Nogay, the two law represen-
tatives, and several of the
veteran members.

This years committee does
not claim as its sole achieve-
ment the rewriting of the White
Book. The committee is, accor-
ding to the Student Handbook,
“responsible. for the ad-
ministration of the Honor
System and also the supervision

of all campus activities.’’ And
that is exactly what the EC did.
Campus security was pro-
bably the one issue most of the
university community was con-
cerned with. Early in the year,
attacks on_ students’ by
townspeople occurred regular-
ly, as did thefts of students’ per-
sonal property. It was the Ex-
ecutive Committee which first
approached the problem,
discussing ways security might
be improved. Thanks to the
committee, the Lexington

White Ousted From SC

by Todd Smith
In an emotional, drawn-out
Wednesday night meeting, the
Executive Committee-elect
rescinded the appointment of
Bud White, Chairman of the
Student Control Committee.

Members of Student Control
challenged the White appoint-
ment claiming that their con-
stitution specifies that the
chairman come from the com-
mittee’s own ranks. White was
not elected to Student Control
for 81-82, although he had serv-
ed two years before.

The new Executive Commit-
tee closed the doors and decided
unanimously that they had the
right to name Student Control
Chairmen not elected to the
Committee. By consensus, the
new committeemen then
rescinded White’s appointment.

The EC-elect decided that it
was legally right but morally
wrong to have Student Control
chaired by a non-elected ap-
pointee.

The EC elect then selected
Barry Dunn as chairman, over
Peter Collins and other commit-

teemen. Collins, this year’s
freshman representative to Stu-
dent Control, had made a com-
plaint to the new EC after
White’s selection.

The Monday night meeting
was a measure of the new EC’s
performance capabilities. Of
the eight members at the
meeting, only three were retur-
ning representatives.

Barry Dunn explained during
the meeting, ‘‘These ten guys
can work with Bud. I like him.
But who is to say that future
EC’s may put in chairmen that
the students haven’t elected.”’

‘“‘We are here,’ stated an
emotional Collins, ‘‘because we
think it is not in the best in-
terests of the student body to
appoint a non-elected official.”’

“It is for us to decide what is
in the best interests of the
students,’’ retorted Secretary-
elect Bennett Ross.

Representative John
Vlahoplus advised Student Con-
trol to ignore the EC appoint-
ment and go to the faculty to
determine the extent of its
autonomy.

Four Receive

Mahan Awards

The English Department an-
nounced today the winners of
the Mahan Awards in Creative
Writing. Three awards of $150
each for prose entries from
sophomores, juniors, and
seniors were announced, and
one prize of $200 for a poetry en-
try from an undergraduate.

The winners in prose are Jack
Sharman, ’83, John A. Wells,
82, and Ben Keesee, ’81.
‘Whereas no single entry was
fully achieved,” in the opinion
of the judges, they wished to
recognize ‘‘the ambition and
promise’ of each of the prose
winners. No prize for freshmen
prose was awarded this year.

The verse award went to R.C.

Swagler, Jr., 84 for the “finely
compressed nature poems
“Bluff”? and, especially, ‘‘Pos-
ing.”’ In ‘Posing,’ the judges
said, ‘‘the Tetons come alive
through subtle shifts in rhythm
created by a physical sense of
pause and the weight of words.
Unexpected objects are quietly
brought into juxtaposition:
prairie dogs and blackbirds,
peanuts and children’s fingers.
In the last stanza, ‘a glacier
continues its unnoticed thaw/
and a_ buffalo shifts his
weight.’ ”’

The Mahan Awards were
established under the will of
George A. Mahan of Hannibal,
Missouri, a ‘‘Lee student’ who
died in 1936.

To Clean Up. Act

Having failed a house inspec-

the Sigma Nu social fraternity

Committee to insure that the
fraternity meets basic universi-

cases of fraternity misconduct,
met with Sigma Nu officers to
investigate the reports of finan-
cial negligence and complaints
of very poor house conditions
from alumni as well as others.

While the house officers did
admit to problems with the.
fraternity, they appeared to be
sincere, according to Professor
Robert J. de Maria, an SAC
member, in their efforts to cor-
rect the situation.

After a private meeting, the
SAC set up a series of measures
that would give Sigma Nu time
to get in physical and financial

order:

— No members will be allow-
ed to live or eat at the house un-
til significant repairs are made
on the house, but the fraternity
will be allowed to perform rush
functions in the house.

— The fraternity will be re-
quired to appoint a faculty ad-
viser as well as a scholarship of-
ficer.

— There will be an oversight
committee, composed of Dean

Murphy, associate dean of
students, the university
treasurer, Mr. Epley, two

representatives from Sigma Nu
natignal which is based in Lex-
ington, two members from
Sigma Nu fraternity corpora-
tion, and the fraternity faculty
adviser.

Dean Murphy stressed the
point that these were not
punitive measures but actions
taken to improve the chapter.
Prof. de Maria added that next
year will be the centennial an-
niversary of the chapter’s ex-
istence at W&L and that it
would be a ‘‘damn shame’”’ if
the fraternity didn’t make it.

Bogus Speed Hawked

by Robin Smithwick

When one first glances at the
headlines it seems incredible.
At the top of the page the bold
print reads ‘‘New Legal
Stimulants,”’ followed by a list
of 28 different types of prescrip-
tion amphetamines, commonly
called ‘‘speed.”’

Awestruck, one may ask
himself whether of not the Food
and Drug Administration has
taken a big turnaround and
legalized these potent pills. But
in actuality, the capsules are
only “‘look alikes,”’ imitations of

real speed.

Throughout the school year,
and particularly around exam

time, flyers advertising these
“look alikes” have been inun-

dating post office boxes of W&L
students.

The only “‘high’’ that can be
achieved from these brightly
colored pills is equivalent to
that of a strong cup of coffee.
They are simply high dosages of
caffeine or other mild
stimulants encased in
numbered capsules which are
supposed to simulate real am-
phetamines. They are effective
for a while, but they clearly do
not have the potency of real
speed.

The biggest tip-off that these
pills are not really what they
appear to be is their relative
low cost. One of these drug

Denny Awarded Rikkyo

International Scholarship

Stephen H. Denny, a
Washington and Lee University
sophomore from Bethesda,
Md., has received a Rikkyo
University International
Scholarship for study at the
Tokyo, Japan, university dur-
ing the 1981-82 school year.

Denny becomes the second
W&L student to receive a
scholarship under the new pro-
gram instituted by Rikkyo
University, which has an ex-
change agreement with four
American institutions — W&L,
the University of Chicago, the
University of the South, and
Kenyon College.

George Bartlett Peaslee, a
1980 graduate of Washington
and Lee, is currently studying

Students, Faculty Present

at Rikkyo under the same

scholarship program.
Denny, who plans to major in
East Asian Studies at

Washington and Lee, will work
with the Japanese faculty at
Rikkyo in the areas of business
and economics.

Rikkyo was founded in 1874 by
a Virginia missionary. It is
widely recognized as one of
Japan’s top-ranking private in-
stitutions.

James Takashi Yashiro, pro-
fessor of Christian studies at
Rikkyo, has spent the past
academic year at Washington
and Lee as the Philip Howerton
Scholar-in-Residence. He will

Serve as Denny’s adviser at
Rikkyo.

‘“‘dealers,’’ the Shehan-
Distributing Co. of Lewistown,
Pa., sells the pills in bottles of
1000 for only $25.

The most common “look
alikes” being sold at W&L are
imitation ‘“‘black beauties,”
which are usually sold for $1 a
“hit,” but can be purchased
here for as low as 30¢a pill.

While these pills do not have
the potency of amphetamines,
they. are a bargain when com-
pared to their commercial
equivalents. No-Doz and
Vivarin, two popular over-the-
counter stimulants, sell for
$4.21 and $3.64 a bottle respec-
tively at Super X in Lexington.

As exam time approaches
once again, the sale of these
‘look alikes” will probably in-
crease. But much of the effects
of these capsules are only
psychological because they are
clearly not the amphetamines
which they are supposed to im-
itate. If one feels he needs
something extra for a long night
of cramming, he can probably
get the same effect from a few
cups of Co-op coffee.

of an earlier article and presen-

conference honoring Wilfred

comparative history of religion
at Harvard University.

‘“Monumenta Nipponica”’ is
one of the two leading English
language journals devoted to
Japanese cultural studies.

Rogers, a B.S. graduate of
Virginia Military Institute who
also holds the bachelor of divini-
ty degree from Virginia

lished by the academy in 1927.
Named for the late Dr. J.
Shelton Horsley, a nationally
prominent surgeon who was the
academy’s fourth president, the
award is determined by a panel
of scientists from a state other
than Virginia.

Since the early 1960s, Jarrard
has been conducting research
into a small portion of the brain
called the hippocampus. His
award-winning paper examined
the relationship between
damage of that part of the brain
and behavior in _ laboratory
animals.

It was the second time this
year that Jarrard’s research
has been selected for an award.
Earlier, the Virginia Psycho-
logical Association presented
its award for Outstanding Con-
tribution to Psychology as a
Science to Jarrard.

Jarrard began his research
into the Hippocampus during
his first stint as a teacher at
Washington and Lee in the early
1960s. After leaving W&L in 1966
to teach at Carnegie-Mellon
University, Jarrard returned to
Washington and Lee in 1971 as
head of the psychology depart-
ment.

A native of Waco, Texas, Jar-
rard received the A.B. degree
from Baylor University and
holds both his M.S. and Ph.D.
degrees from Carnegie-Mellon.

Review:

 

 

 

by M. Shaw Pyle

Hi. Remember me? Yes,
that’s right; it is I, the New
Right Kritik. And it’s time for
another installment in the ongo-
ing struggle between your hum-
ble critic and the Ariel. So, here
goes, as I take up arms for
Truth, Justice, and the
American Way.

You may recall that I had cer-
tain criticisms, not of the fall
Ariel alone, but of the entire
school of writing it belonged to.
I will not repeat those cavils
here; suffice it to say that there
is some improvement in the spr-
ing issue. However, the im-
provement is not uniform, nor is
it anywhere near enough.

It is unfortunate that the Ariel
was not intended to be a sort of
Bartlett’s chock full of new
material, waiting to be borrow-
ed; the volume contains some
great lines. But great lines do
not necessarily form a great
issue, and the new Ariel has

some beautiful moments but
some godawful quarter hours.

The decent quarter hours are

The Men On The Ariel Trapeze

provided by Jake Jones and
Ned MacDonald, whose stories
really deserve the old term
‘finely chiseled.’ Jones’ Silent,

Sing the Steel Chords is possibly
his best work to date; certainly
it is one of the better stories I’ve
read lately. And MacDonald’s
Runnin’ from the Sixties is simp-
ly a must-read.

As for the also-rans, stories
that would have been the best in
the issue if the two discussed
above weren’t around, there are
Russell Clarke’s untitled hun-
ting tale and The Dance, the lat-
ter written in collaboration with
Ron Dionne. Too, there is Jones’
poem The Eye is Calm, two
poems by Rick Swagler, two
more by Lawrence Norford,
and one by David Collins.

To be specific, the flaws in
each of the above are minor or
nonexistent. The poetry re-
quires a good deal of careful at-
tention, but, with the exception
of Swagler’s work, is worth it.

 

French ‘New Wave’

Fi m To Be Shown

by Carren O. Kaston

The last movie this year is the
English Department’s foreign-
film-course series is Jacques
Rivette’s madcap comedy, the
magical Celine and Julie Go
Boating (France, 1974). It will
be screened Tuesday, May 26,
in Reid Hall 203, at one time
only — 7 p.m. The showing is
free of charge and open to the
public.

Rivette is one of a group of '

important French film critics
who turned to directing in the
late 50’s and early 60’s, and,
through their theories and prac-
tice, founded the ‘French New
Wave.”’ Many New-Wave
assumptions still dominate
movie-making as we know it
now. Besides Rivette, this
group of critic-directors in-
cludes, notably, Francois Truf-
faut, Eric Rohmer, Jean-Luc
Godard, and Alain Resnais.
Truffaut has been represented
in our series by Love on the Run
and The Man Who Loved
Women, and Rohmer by the
recently shown Claire’s Knee.
The puzzle-like Celine and
Julie is constructed around a
proliferating series of doubl-

ings, and enacts Rivette’s
predilection for ‘‘endless
stories, on the lines of an Ara-
bian Nights—or soap opera.”
Although it is virtually impossi-
ble to decide whether anything
in the movie “really’’ takes
place, the plot seems to concern
two young women who visit a
haunted house in which the
same melodrama is_ being
endlessly replayed. Each time,
they come away with a sweet in
their mouths that enables them
to relive the story. Eventually,
they go to the house together
and try to avert the conclusion
of the tale, the killing of a child.
Not until the end of the movie do
they ‘‘go boating.”’

The movie shows debts to
Hitchcock and Renoir, among
other directors, and to Lewis
Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland.

Next year’s season will open
on October 16 and 17 with
Bertrand Bliers comedy Get
Out Your Handkerchiefs
(France/Belgium), which was
selected as the best foreign film
of 1978. Our second movie will
be Reinhard Hauff’s superb
psychological thriller, Knife in
the Head (Germany, 1978),
scheduled for November 6 and
ti

 

This is not meant to denigrate
Rick’s poetry, either, so just
hold off on the letter to the
editor accusing me of fascism
or similar criminality. It is
simply that it is difficult to ex-
trapolate Swagler’s vignettes
into anything really enlighten-

ing. One should be able to con-

zntertainment

struct whole philosophies out of
a poem; in these works, we are
led to nothing new or striking.
This is the problem, to a lesser
degree, with the other poetry,
but the other works do come a
little closer to the mark, and at
least they find a fresh way of
stating the axioms.

As far as the rest of the issue
goes, The Dance fails in the final
analysis because of the authors’
apparent inability to univer-
salize the experience recounted

in the story. Friends of mine
(yes, I do have a few) from

Long Island assure me that the
piece is very significant... to
them. The fact that it is not
prima facie significant to me

argues that is not fully realised
aS an veuvre.

The work of Lawrence Davis
and Tom Southall is a succes-
sion of beautiful moments that

never quite form a time. The
similes and metaphors both

employ are remarkable, but I
can discern no_ structure
beneath. They’re just there: ic-
ing and no cake. Believe me, it
gets old.

This lack of core — a lack I

lamented at length in the fall
—is the rift in several lutes:
particularly those of Jude Mar-
tin and Phillip Welch; it and a
certain puerility of tone (if in-
tentional, overplayed; if ac-
cidental, painful) make Andrew
Trotter’s music mute as well. In
terms of the text, I’ve saved the
best for last: there is an untitled
poem, like a sudden spring in
a parched land, that could be
overlooked, but mustn’t be: it’s
by Kerry Wilson, and if you
understand it and the story by
MacDonald that preceeds it,
you'll know what I’m talking
about in these reviews and why
I get so frustrated with the Ariel
when they go astray.

P.S.: the photos and layout
are superior, but start
proofreading your copy, OK,
guys?

Last Friday night, the Ap-
palachian Dance and Music
Ensemble performed a variety
of pieces on the stage at Lex-
ington High School.

The company is based in West
Virginia and _ performs
throughout Kentucky, and has
gained quite a reputation west
of the Blue Ridge range. The
company is supported by grants
from the Federal government,
private endowments, and the
West Virginia Council on the
Arts.

Included in their vast reper-
toire is the poetry of West
Virginia’s State Poet Laureate,
Dr. Louise McNeil Pease. They
have taken from Dr. Pease’s
book, The Elderberry Flood,
several poems representative
of Appalachia and produced
various choreographic, lyrical,
and instrumental interpreta-
tions.

The company is surprisingly
small — five dancers and four
musicians — nine in all. The ar-
tistic dance director Toreta
Manning is the principle
choreographer and is a heavy
set, tremendously talented
dancer. The other dancers, Bar-
bara Hopkins, Deborah and

 

Jennifer Donaldson (sisters),

The Appalachian

Dance Review:

Dance Ensemble

and Charles Baker are equally
talented. The musical director
John Yurick plays piano,
guitar, mandolin, and banjo and
also does the arranging and
composing. For the _perfor-
mances, Dan Manning,
Toreta’s husband, does the in-
troductions and plays guitar,
mandolin, auto harp, and an ex-
cellent penny whistle. The other
two musicians are Alan Martin

on bass and electric bass and’

Dan Bailey playing a highly
skilled classical guitar. Dan
Manning also does the singing
for all the lyrical pieces.

The name of the company,
Appalachian Dance and Music
Ensemble, is misleading, as
was demonstrated readily dur-
ing the university sponsored
performance. Although they
understandably have a wide
range of Appalachia-linked

pieces, they displayed a
tremendous’ versatility
throughout the show.

The first piece, ‘“‘SH Bheag,
SH’Mho’r,” was in a classical
ballet style set to a traditional
Irish Highlands tune. The
dancers portrayed maidens in
the meadows collecting flowers.
In this piece, Ms. Manning’s
choreography was particularly
well suited for Jennifer

Donaldson as she demonstrated
a lightning quickness in move;
ment and a_ seeming ef-
fortlessness.

The last number in Act I was
titled ‘‘Jubilee.’”’ Performed to
the taped music of Spyro Gyra,
this was a jazz number danced
by all the Dance Ensemble.
Previously, in SH’ Bheag, SH’
Mho’r Charles Baker seemed
stiff in the rigidly classical
Style, but to the ‘‘dancing
music’”’ of Spyro Gyra, Mr.
Baker was completely at home
with the jazz rythyms and
seemed to enjoy it much more.

The Ensemble as a whole put
on a fine presentation with no
visible rough spots in spite of
the adverse conditions. The
stage floor was hard to work
with and the company had very
little time to adjust as most of
them arrived less than two
hours before the performance,
leaving even less time to set up
and then practice or warm up.
But, even under the cir-
cumstances, the performers
are true professionals and
presented a fine production.
This was their first perfor-
mance here, but I hope that
after such a successful debut I
will have the opportunity to see
them more than once next year.

What can one say about a play
that ends in death, destruction,
and the remains of heavily
chewed scenery and yet fails to
offend, sorrow, or depress
anybody? A play with only
friendly violence, no sexual ex-
plicitry, and a total absence of
psychoanalytic this, that, and
the other? I mean, it simply
isn’t modern.

No, thank God, but it sure can
be fun. This is the appropriate
vehicle for scene-chewing, gun-
toting melodramatics. No
highbrow stuff here, no
demands on the audience to
analyze the leading man’s

sort of way. The critic had a
blast (after he calmed
down...being deliberately in-
sulted by the cast and crew on
the way into the theatre is hard-
ly the foot off which one wishes
to start).

The play is a great deal like
parts of the Mississippi: it is
broad and by no means deep. If
one wants social commentary,
this is not the play one seeks.
(Historically, it’s tripe-and trite
tripe, too). But the latitude in
the play allows for any amount
of missed cues, muffed lines,
and garbled singin’ and hoofin’
— which was just as well on
opening night. But for what it is
— a romp — it went well
enough. The cast was adequate
and often better (and hammier)
than merely adequate; the sets,
costumes, and sundries rather
better than usual. It ain’t The

a waste of time. Take the kids,

Lovell And Gaker
Take Second

by Dale Park

Washington and Lee seniors
Pete Lovell and Doug Gaker
upheld the University’s reputa-
tion as a small-college tennis
power this past week when they
earned All-America honors in
doubles’ competition at the
sixth annual NCAA Division III
Championships, held Wednes-
day through Saturday, May
13-16, at Salisbury State College
in Maryland.

Lovell, from Bedford, N.H.,
and Gaker, from Middleton,
Ohio, finished second in a field
of 32 doubles entries to earn the
award and mark the fifth con-
secutive year a W&L entry has
claimed an All-America laurel.
Their performance marks the
third time W&L_ has
represented the doubles’ finals
at the NCAA event, the first
time coming in 1977 when Ben
Johns and Stewart Jackson won
the title, the second in 1978 when
Johns and Jackson finished se-
cond.

Lovell and Gaker began their
march to the finals by winning
their first-round match on
Wednesday and their second-
round contest on Thursday to
advance to quarterfinal action
on Friday. There they won 6-4,
6-3 over Rod Dowdle and Ben
Sheehy from Swarthmore (Pa. )
College to earn a berth in that
same afternoon’s semifinal
round, where they triumphed
5-7, 6-4, 6-1 over Rico Silveira
and Bill Harper from Millsaps

(Miss.) College. In Saturday’s
title match, Lovell and Gaker
bowed to Jim Hern and Shaun
Miller from Gustavus-Adolphus

(Minn. ) College, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.

Their four doubles wins,
coupled with each one’s
opening-round singles’ win on

Wednesday, gave W&L six

points and a sixth-place finish in

the team standings. Swarth-
more and Claremont-Mudd

(Calif.) College collected nine

points each to tie for first;

Bates (Maine) College,

Kalamazoo (Mich.), and

Gustavus-Adolphus compiled

seven points each to deadlock

for second.
The All-America honor is

Gaker’s first and Lovell’s se-

cond, the first coming at the
1980 NCAA Championships
when he and_ then-senior
Stewart Jackson reached the
semifinals in doubles competi-
tion before bowing out. Gaker
had participated in the 1978,
1979, and 1980 NCAA events.
Their 4-1 record in the cham-
pionships gave them an 18-14
mark in overall doubles’ play
this spring.

Lovell and Gaker will now
compete in the 97th Annual
NCAA Division I Champion-
ships, held May 16-24 at the
University of Georgia in
Athens, Georgia. Every year
the champion and runner-up in
both Division III singles and
doubles are invited to compete
in the Division I event.

In what was the final game of
the season, the Washington and
Lee lacrosse team came out on
the short end of a 12-11 sudden
death overtime decision to the
University. of Maryland-
Baltimore.

‘We got off to a slow start,”
remarked W&L coach Jack
Emmer as the UMBC
Retrievers literally shelled the
Generals by scoring four goals
in the first four minutes of play.
The Generals, however, came
roaring back to tie the score at
5-5 at the midway point of the
game.

The second half saw a neck
and neck battle with neither
team ever maintaining more
than a two goal advantage.
Largely due to the play of the
W&L defense, the Generals
were able to keep pace with the
number 9 ranked Retrievers.
W&L goalie Ware Palmer turn-
ed in a particularly impressive
performance with 17 saves on
the day to keep the game tight.

With the score even at eleven
goals a piece at the end of
regulation time, the Generals
took immediate possession of
the ball on the face off at the
start of the overtime period.
W&L failed to connect,
however, and at just one minute
and three seconds into the over-
time, UMBC fired home the

game winning goal.

Despite the outcome of the
game, the Generals, according
to Coach Emmer, played hard,
with pride and competitiveness.
Among the scorers for W&L
credited with two goals were
Mike Schuler, George Santos,
Bob Carpenter, and Geoff
Brent. Others included Geoff
Wood, Jerry Broccoli, and John
Sancilio. UMBC boosted their
season record to 8 and 3 while
the Generals slipped to 6-4,
eliminating them from NCAA

Ass Lax ClosesWith Loss

Division I tournament competi-
tion.

Though the 6-4 season record
was a rather bitter disappoint-
ment, Emmer was pleased with
the ‘‘fine effort’’ his players
gave throughout the season.
Next year, with the loss of
several valuable graduating
seniors, ‘‘There will be a lot of
holes to fill,’ says Emmer. Yet
with the progressive experience
of some of the younger players,
W&L will, with luck, remain a
Division I threat.

ODAC Adds One

Pending re-classification this
June from NCAA Division I to
Division III status, Catholic
University was approved Mon-
day, May 18 as the tenth
member of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference at the

league’s annual spring
meetings held here.
The vote, taken by the

athletic directors of the nine
present ODAC member col-
leges, approves Catholic for
competition in conference
championship events beginning
in September, 1982. The vote
carries the stipulation that
Catholic, iocated in
Washington, D.C., be given
Division III (no athletic

scholarship) status by the
NCAA Classification Commit-
tee at its June meeting. Catholic
petitioned the NCAA in 1980 for
the change.

Catholic will become the se-
cond non-Virginia college to
enter the league, which began
Operations in fall, 1976 with
eight Virginia colleges as
charter members: Bridgewater
College, Eastern Mennonite
College, Emory & Henry Col-
lege, Hampden-Sydney College,
Lynchburg College, Randolph-
Macon College, Roanoke Col-
lege, and Washington and Lee
University. Maryville College,
located in Tennessee, joined the
ODAC in the summer of 1979.

_ Experienced Gridders Show Promise

by John M. Cleghorn

The beginning of the 1981 foot-
ball season will be the first time
that head coach Gary Fallon
will have a team that he can call
his own. The upcoming season
will be Fallon’s fourth and the
team will be made up of players
that have all been recruited by
his staff. This might not be a
marked date for any other
school but for Washington and
Lee, whose football program is
in the midst of a turnaround, the
date only marks promise. The
records for the last three
seasons have improved
moderately from 2-8 to 3-7 to
last season’s 6-4 and _ the
Generals show potential for
continued improvement. In the
Falcon’s words ‘‘you don’t. get
too fancy too fast.”’

The Generals only graduate
six seniors leaving a team that
is very old in comparison to the
last several years. Coach
Fallon remarks, “‘this will be
the first time that we will be
looking at other teams eye to
eye instead of looking up to
them.” The biggest loss to the
Generals will be in the offensive
line. Three seniors will not
return leaving a line which in
Fallon’s words ‘“‘has the size
and the strength but not the ex-

perience, the boys will have to
grow up in a hurry.” Chris
Cavelline will return at
tailback, a player who last
season might have become
W&L’s first 1000 yard rusher
had not injury gotten in the
way. Several talented quarter-
backs return including the two
players that have shared the
position for the last three years.
The defense returns the bulk of
its talent running the 5-2 again
with several variations.

Many of the Generals have
spent their spring as members
of the Barbell club. The club
gives the players a chance to
maintain and improve their
strength in the off season. ‘‘We
encourage our kids to get in-
volved in it (the Barbell club),”’
comments coach Fallon, ‘“‘it
isn’t mandatory. Our kids have
taken onto themselves to be in
there and prove their size, their
strength, and their confidence.”

The Generals will report to
school on the 22nd of August and
begin their training for the
opener against Gettysburg on
the 12th of September. The
Generals will be joined by an
‘‘impressive’’ group. of
freshmen. ‘‘We’re getting
starters off of some outstanding
teams, with some fairly good

size for a change,’’ comments
Fallon.

The competition in the ODAC
will be no help to the Generals’
progress. ‘“‘Emory and Henry,
Randolph-Macon, Maryville,
Bridgewater, and Hampden-
Sydney are all contenders,”
says coach Fallon, ‘‘Anybody
can beat anybody on a given
Saturday. We’re only concerned
with who we play next.”

 

 

Fourth Year Head Coach Gary Fallon

With all the factors included,
the age of the team, the off-
season training, the leadership
and experience the Generals
have a good shot at continuing
the rising winning tradition at
W&L. Next season will bring
quality football at W&L pro-
duced by head coach Gary
Fallon which may lead to fewer
minks abandoning the second
half to refill their flasks.

Rugger’s Season Builds For Future

by L. E. Babits

The Generals rugby team
spent the entire season learning
how to play rugby. When the
spring season began, there
were three players who had
more than five games’ playing
time. In addition to these
“veterans,” five others had
played in the fall season and
knew some of the rudiments. A
good recruiting effort brought
out some very skilled athletes,
but they had to be trained.

Knowing that the Generals
would be short on experience
meant that far more time had to
be spent on basics and working
people into unfamiliar roles
which were vital to a team con-
cept. Match scheduling attemp-
ted to provide the ruggers with
opposition better organized and
more experienced than they to
hasten the learning process.
Playing against better op-
ponents meant that learning
would be more rapid but win-
ning might be difficult.

The first match against a
mixed Aside from Virginia
Tech showed how far the
Generals had come in_ the
spring practices but did not pro-
duce a win because the
Generals gave up 15 points in
penalties and lost 19-18. The
next two matches, against
Longwood and Lynchburg Col-
lege, were both won on the
strength of aggressive play and
a hard hitting defense. Exams
brought a respite from practice
and this break might have hurt
the team.

The Generals were next in ac-
tion on a five-game tour of
North Carolina. This tour was
designed to provide a concen-
trated, sink or swim, learning
exercise. Evaluation of the
results is difficult because the
Generals suffered so many in-
juries that the team was effec-
tively crippled at key positions
for some time. Nevertheless,
the tour must be considered a
success. The ruggers played
well but lost to UNC-Greens-
boro and Greensboro City RFC
on the first weekend.

Against UNC-Chapel Hill, the
ruggers were clearly outclassed
by the Tarheel backs, many of
whom were British studying in
the states. The Generals nearly
knocked off NC State, despite
playing with only 14 players for
most of the second half. Finally,
on the last day of the tour, the
Generals went ahead, fell
behind and then rallied
magnificently to defeat Cape
Fear RFC in Wilmington.

Immediately upon returning
to Lexington, the Generals
played host to Belsize Park, a
British touring side from north
London. An early lead was lost,
then regained and lost again as
the battered, tired Generals
were outfinessed by their
British opponents. The lessons
of that day were drummed into
the Generals at the party
following the match and the
results were seen quickly. Four
days later the W&L ruggers
took on powerful Roanoke and
jumped out to an early 10 point
lead before falling short in the
end.

By this time in the season,
virtually all the Generals were
playing two games because so
many players had given up or
had been injured. It is difficult
to guess about what might have
been had these summer soldiers
had the courage to stick it out.
Those who did stick it out all
erded playing on the first side
at one time or another. The
team also began to resemble a
bandaid brigade as the ac-
cumulating aches and pains
were continually aggravated by
more playing. Oh well, ‘‘no rest
for the weary”’ and all the other
cliches about tough going would
be redundant now.

Following the disappointing
loss to Roanoke, the Generals
went down to Blacksburg ex-
pecting to play VPI’s second
side. Instead, they were faced
with the Hokie A team which
had just made the final eight
teams of the Eastern Rugby
Union Collegiate Tournament to
pick an eventual national cham-
pion. The Hokies gave the
Generals fits, although W&L
never gave up. The next day,
the Generals rebounded and
battled Lynchburg City right
down to the wire before losing in
a light drizzle.

The players were so hurt and
tired that only one practice was
held the next week and that was
short and light before the final

two matches. Great things

come to those who wait and
persevere. In their final home
game the Generals thrashed

Winchester as they played a

tremendous second half. In

their final game, the ruggers
came from behind to defeat

New River RFC in Radford.

The final 5-9 record does not
reflect accurately on the perfor-
mance of the ruggers. Until
their last two matches, they
played teams far more ex-
perienced and with a better
source of players. Yet the

Xs

Generals probably should have
won two or three of those
matches and were competitive
in all but the second VPI match.
At the end, the team proved that
learning through competitive
play and teamwork could pro-
duce a superior team in due
time. It seemed a shame to end
the season just as the pieces
finally fell into position.

There were many notable
episodes and heroes aplenty
over the course of the spring.
Workhorses_ included Lee
Minetree and Tim Griffin in the
backs and Todd Alexander and
Gene Newton in the forwards
and there were other standouts
too numerous to mention. Herb
Funsten kicked the team to vic-

tory with his accurate toe. The
entire forward unit, as a group,
jelled quickly and held their
own against all opposition. The
more loosely organized backs,
hampered by injuries, inex-
perience and a lack of defensive
teamwork took longer to come
around, but their final matches
were quite good.

Despite the loss of seniors like
Griffin, Minetree, Herdlin, Gor-
don, Foy and Johnson, the team
now has a solid foundation with
which to start the fall season.
Replacement of players at
several key positions will be
necessary before the standard
of play against Winchester and
New River is attained again.
Potential Virginia Collegiate

players include Todd Alexander
at hooker, Gene Newton at
flanker, Herb Funsten at

Number 8 and Chris Leiser at
wing. A good turnout by the stu-
dent body might press these
players to keep their jobs and
that would have to help the
team immensely,

All in all, the ruggers achiev-
ed some success in creating a
core of players for the future
and won some games. Although
the initial pre-season goal of an
undefeated season was not at-
tained, the spring season must
be regarded as a highly suc-
cessful effort on the part of the-

players who struggled against
adversity for so long. Well done,
I say.

Counter-Culture At W&L

AOAOA: Expressing Difference Through Posters

by Ted Fletcher

Unlike most students at
Washington and Lee, AOAOA
members seem content to be
different from their peers, and
to express that difference
through obscure posters on the
Colonnade. The authors of this
‘xerox art’? maintain that the
original concept was derived
from ‘‘the seedier portions of
the somewhat pseudo-psycho-
surrealist portions of their
brains.’’ Calling themselves ar-
tists, they seek to expand the
consciousness of their
classmates by posting inter-
pretations and expressions of
‘some kind of reality,
something close to cabbage’ —
other members would say “‘car-
rots’’ instead — ‘‘and accoun-
tants.’’ They do not go together
very well, but they are both im-
portant. Needless to say,

The Four Certainties

 

 

 

AOAOA is an_ unusual, if
obscure, combination of enter-
tainment and alternative ideas.

And just what is ‘‘xerox art’’?
It is part of a new movement —
gastro-intestinal or otherwise —
in cheap surrealism. Basically
an obscure poster is created
and then submitted to an un-
suspecting Xerox machine,
sometimes causing the machine
to blink ‘‘Call key operator,” for
the rest of the day. To a large
extent, the posters are a reac-
tion to the dull and bland poster
campaigns of other campus
organizations. ‘‘The Xerox copy
is the king for communication
of events on campus, sO we
thought we would jump into the
act and throw in our interpreta-
tion of Xerox art.’’ Undoubtedly
the Dadaist and Surrealist in-
fluences are immediately ap-
parent; as one member said’:
“Essentially this is just an ex-
tension of the Dada movement
from the Teens and the Twen-
ties; Dada is just crazy, ran-
dom free association of words
and objects.” For AOAOA the
medium is to a large extent the
message.

The first AOAOA poster was
the poem entitled ‘‘Dear
Citizens of the People’s
Republic of the United States”’
which can be found in the back

  

robber fly attacking a grasshopper

of this fall’s Ariel. ‘‘We had
originally put a large number of
copies inside Lee Chapel for
Tom Wolfe’s speech last spring.
Unfortunately one of the little
old ladies who worked there
“spotted our efforts at obscuri-
ty, and took most of the posters
away before anyone could seem
them.’ Taking in stride the
snub of the Lee Chapel staff,
they returned in the fall with a
more determined effort. In the
early days of AOAOA copies
were put up late at night under
the cover of darkness.
Responses to the posters were
varied, ranging from applause
to perplexity to indignation. Of
course, any reaction was
welcome. One member said
this: “I can’t understand why
some people get excited about
people trying to be provocative,
so my intention in putting these
up is two-fold: one is to express
alternative ideas, and the se-
cond is to ingrate those people
who can not tolerate free ex-
pression.”’

Yet there is a message that
seeks to awaken the awareness
of the Washington and Lee com-
munity to alternative ideas
about energy, sex roles, social
values, and tolerance of dif-
ferent personal habits. AOQAOA
has been called W&L’s

“BRING DRAMA

Jf

desperate example of a
“counter-culture;’’ one person
called it the ‘‘pseudo-radical de-
viant fringe of an otherwise col-
orless, textureless,
homogeneous student body.”
When asked whether their
posters were a direct attack on
the common lifestyle at this
school AOAOA’s response was
ambiguous. Although the
posters are to a large extent a
social comment about the state
of modern life, they are also
poignant attacks at what some
students see especially lacking
at this school — sincere, effec-
tive communication in mean-
ingful inter-personal relations.
‘“‘Now wait a minute, let’s not
get too heavy with the high con-

sciousness Crap.”’

More than anything else
AOAOA’s posters seek to blend
humor, albeit obscure, with dif-
ferent, heretofore unvoiced,
ideas. ‘‘On the one hand we are
trying to expose people to dif-
ferent things, and on the other
hand we are just trying to be
entertainers.” They are trying
to make people think and go
‘‘huh?”’, but also to make peo-
ple laugh. One might say the
essential difference that
separates AOAOA from the
larger body of students is the
need to conform to pre-
established rules of conduct and
the need to express one’s in-
dividuality.

| Two Receive Lature Awards

Two sophomores, Craig T.
Albanese and John C.
Vlahoplus, have received the
first Rupert N. Latture Awards,
presented by W&L’s chapter of
Omicron Delta Kappa.

Since Omicron Delta Kappa,
the national organization
recognizing outstanding leaders

on college campuses, is limited -

to juniors and seniors, the Lat-
ture Award was established to
recognize outstanding leader-
ship and service among
members of the sophomore
class.

Albanese, a chemistry and
biology major from Melville,
N.Y., is a member of Phi Eta
Sigma (freshman honorary
society), Alpha Epsilon Delta
(pre-medical honorary socie-
ty), the Student Recruitment
Committee, and the universi-
ty’s ad hoc committee on liberal
education. In addition, he is a
member of the W&L varsity
lacrosse team and an orderly at
Stonewall Jackson Hospital in

Lexington.

Viahoplus, en economics ma-
jor from Columbia, S.C., recent-
ly won the prestigious Harry S.
Truman Scholarship, awarded
to only one student from each
state. He is a member of Phi
Eta Sigma, the Student Recruit-
ment Committee’ the fencing
team, and Pi Kappa Phi social
fraternity. He was recently
elected junior representative to
the study body executive com-

mittee for 1981-82. Vlahoplus
also received the Phi Beta Kap-
pa Award in March in recogni-
tion of his perfect 4.0 grade
point average.

The Latture Award is named
in honor of the last surviving
member of Omicron Delta Kap-
pa. Latture, a 1915 graduate of
W&L, was professor of political
science at the university from
1920 to 1962. He now serves as
assistant to the president.

leading Beckett scholars from
around the world.

Ray’s paper was entitled
‘Finding Winnie’s’ ‘Lost
Classics’ in Samuel Beckett's
‘Happy Days’ ”’ and dealt with
the two-act Beckett play ‘‘Hap-
‘py Days.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A Time Of Uncertainty

For most college seniors, this is a time of uncertain-
ty. For more than a decade, life has been molded
around education and learning. Summers always
meant long vacations, the remainder of the year
meant school. Now school is nearing its end and the
familiar surroundings are about to disappear.

But our education has prepared us for the uncer-
tainty of the future, an uncertainty that is real and
scary, but an uncertainty that we should look upon
with anticipation. We are somehow ready for this
uncertainty. And somehow we know that in the end,
we'll make it.

Uncertainty about the future is not restricted to
American college seniors. But here, our uncertainty
is over salaries and marriage, taxes and entertain-
ment. We do have the same concerns as millions of
other people around the world, an uncertainty about
all those things we as Americans take for granted.

In Israel, the people are uncertain whether tomor-
row means facing another deadly war with the Arabs.
In Poland, uncertainty whether a foreign superpower
will invade the Poles freedom starved country
prevails. In El Salvador, uncertainty means surviv-
ing the daily massacres by both left wing and right
wing fanatics. And in India, starvation magnifies the
uncertainty of waking up tomorrow.

With the education Washington and Lee seniors now
have acquired comes a responsibility to use the
education positively. Use your education to preserve
America’s hope for tomorrow. Use your education to
solve the problems America faces in the future. And
use your education to permit others to learn what you
have learned. Everyone should be as fortunate as
you, the class of 1981.

Law Students Irritate Undergrads

Dear Editor:

As the school year comes to a
close, it seems that many of the
members of the Law School
wish to withdraw their opposi-
tion to the unification of the Law
and Undergraduate Schools. It
appears that the Under-
graduate library has been in-

vaded by the ‘‘more important” °

law students studying for their
ominous finals. What these
students do not seem to realize
is that the Undergraduate
library is not the Law School
library and that it does not
belong solely to the ‘‘so much
smarter and superior than thou
(Undergraduates )’’ law
students.

We seem to recall a few law

students expressing their opin-
ions on the opposition to the
unification of the Law and
Undergraduate Schools in the

March 12, 1981 issue of the
RING-TUM PHI. From the let-
ter, the sixteen included law
students believe ‘The two
schools should not be forced into
an unnatural unity, but should

instead be allowed a separate
and equal co-existence.” If this
philosophy were true, then the
Undergraduates should not be
forced to put up with the rules
and regulations inflicted on us
by the law students benefiting
from the use of our library.

The Undergraduates are
more than happy to accom-
modate the law students in our
library, but in the future, the
law students must remember
that it is our library and that
they do not run it nor do they
have the right to regulate the
Undergraduates who use the
library.

Respectfully submitted,

Commentary By Scott M

The Glorification Of An Ex-Con

Several months ago rock star John Lennon was
shot and killed. Earlier this Spring President
Ronald Reagan was struck by an assassin’s bullet.
And now Pope John Paul rests in critical condition
as a result of an attempt on his life.

Last Wednesday night in Lee Chapel I sat
fascinated as I heard the tale of ex-con Frank
Abagnale. At the conclusion of his story I gave him
a rousing round of applause and left Lee Chapel in
a State of utter enthrallment. I contemplated sen-
ding Mr. Abagnale a ten dollar check for his
autobiography, ‘“‘Catch Me If You Can’”’ when the
harsh realization of just what exactly I was doing
suddenly dawned. Frank Abagnale was a
criminal, a fugitive of the law. He stole, cheated,
lied, and literally ripped off millions, if not
billions, of dollars. Now Frank Abagnale, at the
age of 33, makes his living by using his reputation.
Frank Abagnale is not modest about telling his life
story, how many stunts he pulled, how many
phony checks he forged, and from how many
prisons he escaped. He is not modest about being
given the rare classification of ‘‘Master Thief”’ or
of having television shows and motion pictures
based upon his life. Frank Abagnale has, so justice
says, paid his debt to society. He no longer makes
his money by swindling innocent people. He is,
they say, no longer a criminal. On the contrary,

Frank Abagnale is now a nationwide hero.

Perhaps the greatest irony of it all is that Frank
Abagnale still remains a con. He and his company
take in over $10-million a year, and that money
comes largely from those of us who pay for Frank
Abagnale’s autobiography, his T-shirts, and his
other promotional knik-knaks. Perhaps the
greatest crime is owed to the American people in
elevating Abagnale from a thief toa saint.

The American people have been repulsed at the
death of Lennon and the attempted assassinations
of Reagan and Pope John Paul. Yet the American
people turn around and praise a man like Frank
Abagnale, a criminal, for his “fascinating”
pranks. It is, perhaps, the act of glorifying Frank
Abagnale which is so repulsive, which so utterly
degrades the human race.

As one fellow student put it, “‘Abagnale’s speech
would have been great if it had been a stand up
comedy act.’’ But it was real, and Abagnale was
speaking of real live people who fell prey to his
vicious schemes. Frank Abagnale is and always
will be a con. But if Americans continue to exalt
Abagnale as a hero then he has succeeded in conn-
ing us all. And that, my friends, is, indeed,
repulsive.

Police Department, and univer-
sity officials, the number of at-
tacks and thefts has decreased.
Two additional “university
security personnel have been
hired, and lighting around the
university is slated to be im-
proved. Future EC presidents
should remember that Willis
personally met with Lexington
Mayor Charles Phillips and
Lexington Police Chief J.A. Kir-
by. Sometimes it is best if the
man in charge goes right to the
problem.

Of course, even if you’re Bob
Willis, that does not guarantee
that everything will work out
for the best. Willis personally
tried to revise the university's
uncompromising _ pass/fail
system in the fall, suggesting to
university administrators that
professors not know who is
enrolled in a course pass/fail.
He came away from the
meetings with little; at least the
entire school can no longer read
the list of pass/fail students
posted on the colonnade. At
least Willis tried. The EC presi-
dent in the year 2000 should

try again. By then it may work.
For the first time in many
years, the numerous subcom-
mittees under the Executive
Committee’s jurisdiction were
tightly controlled. The EC re-
quired every subcommittee
ranging from the SAB to Cold
Check to appear monthly with
financial reports. Committee
members, especially Marshall
Clark, often grilled the many
chairmen’ who _ presented
monthly reports, asking them
questions that had never before
been asked by an EC. The com-
mittee’s efforts appear to have
paid off; money is no longer
wasted (except by the SBA’s
social committee), and commit-
tees are more effectively
operated. There is no excuse for
this practice to be discontinued
in the future.

Similarly, it is hoped that
future EC’s, especially next
year’s, will bear in mind the
alcohol survey requested by the
committee. Usually, an Ex-
ecutive Committee concerns
etself only with functions
necessary for keeping the stu-
dent government running. ‘Ins

year, however, junior EC
member Eric Myers perceived
a drinking: problem at W&L,
discussed the matter with the
committee, and initiated the
survey which was_ released
several weeks ago. Unfor-
tunately, it is again too late in
the year to do anything about
this important issue now, but
next year’s committee already
has the groundwork laid for it.
It will have to follow-up closely
the work of this EC.

The committee should also be
commended for its important
discussions about the disunity
that exists between the law
school campus and_ the
undergraduate colonnade. This
too is an extremely touchy mat-
ter and one that could balloon
into a crucial issue in the com-
ing years. Bob Willis & Co. met
with the SBA earlier this year in

an effort to figure out how the
two campuses can be united

‘spiritually’ if not physically.
Although it will take many
more meetings and many more
hours of discussion before the
matter is resolved, initial ef-
forts by the EC have again il-
lustrated that no issue was too

large for the committee to han-

dle.

The Executive Committee
has proved itself this year in all
aspects of student government
except for one — student elec-
tions. Elections for class and
student body officers and
amendment changes were con-
ducted in a manner which,
more times than not, dissuaded
students from voting. Polls
were not always manned, cam-
paign violations were common,
and once a poll actually ran out
of ballots. Put simply, elections
were a farce.

Board is partly responsible for
the serious problems, but the

ultimately responsible for en-
suring that committees do their
jobs effectively. The EC should
be credited for at least discuss-
ing the problems. Sophomore
EC member Pete Baumgaert-
ner even chaired a small sub-
committee examining the pro-
blem, But drastic steps need to
be taken now, before the next
elections in the fall. ue
the VRB should be staffed ex
clusively with EC members or
abolished forever.

Using this year’s Executive
Committee as a prime example
of how a student body should be
run, future EC’s should be able
to accomplish much of what
needs to be done. Probably no
E€ can ever do everything that
needs doing, but this committee
came close. It made a few
mistakes, and it could have
handled some issues more ef-
fectively. But students should
be pleased that they were well
represented this year. Future
Executive Committees have
their work cut out for them.
