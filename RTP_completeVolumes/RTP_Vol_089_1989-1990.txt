Washington and Lee's chapter of
Phi Delta Theta has hired a house
mother and has been put on
probation after the chapter's house
was left “just generally trashed" at
the end of May, according to

- Associate Dean of Students Leroy

r

“Buddy” Atkins.

In an Aug. 22 letter to chapter
President Warren Holland, Atkins
said the probation, which will
continue at least until Jan. 29, 1990,
limits the number of Phi Delt pledges
to 15. The probation also bans week-

- night parties and limits the Phi Delts

to only four parties per month and
only two per month in the Phi Delt
house. 1
Also, the house grade—point
average must rise at least one place
per term in the rankings of
fraternities, and the chapter me.-‘t
' “develop -and implement an ongoing
service project to benefit the
community, the college or the Greek
system," Atkins wrote.

Finally, “the chapter must
improve its relationship and
cooperation with other Greek
organizations on campus and

substantially improve its reputation,”
the letter said.

In an interview Tuesday, Atkins
said the 1988-89 academic year was
«the second straight that ended with
Phi Delt house in
condition and in
.,\jolation of W&L's Standards for

Proctor Charles "Murph" Murray
said he entered the house on June 1
and discovered that nearly all the
windows on the second and third
floors had been broken.

‘exists in the house that this is the

U i In the letter to Holland. Atkins
said, “after viewing the condition in

' which the chapter house was left
following ﬁnal exams, there is no
question that a substantial number of
brothers lacks the minimal respect for
property and particularly for the
chapter house which is required by
the Standards."
‘ Atkins said the probation is
“intended to be a stern reminder" of
the importance of compliance with
the Standards and “to serve as a
guideline for the rapid solution of

chapter problems.” He said that, if
the conditions are not met, W&L
“will withdraw its recognition of the
chapter."

While Holland said he
understands Atkins’ position, he said
some aspects of the probation —
particularly the limit on the number
of pledges — were “a little unfair."
He said representatives of his
fraternity met with Atkins Wednesday
and asked him to rescind some
aspects of the probation, but he said
those appeals failed.

"A few bad people have done the
damage," Holland said. “I don't
think anybody in this house now had
anything to do with that.”

Holland said he thinks most of
the damage to the house was caused

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

Over the summer, several major

changes were made in the
Washington and Lee athletic
department. In unrelated moves,

athletic director William McHenry
resigned from his post and head
lacrosse coach Dennis Daly was
reassigned to a new position within
the department.

McHenry, who also serves as the
head of the physical education
department, held the position of
athletic director at W&L from 1971
to 1989. His resignation went into
effect on July 1 of this year.

Said W&L president John Wilson,
"Bill's wonderful, outgoing
personality and admirable values have
given great strength to the work of
our university. I am confident that
Bill's experience and character will
lead to a stronger department of
physical education and a revitalized
intramural program."

McHenry, a Swarthmore, Pa.
native, received his bachelor of
science degree from W&L in 1954

ware County, in downstate New York.

mental hospitals and was at one time diag-

At about 1:30, Eben appeared from

University of Pennsylvania in 1961.

McHenry started his coaching
career at Pennsylvania Military
College, where he coached football,
swimming and track and also served
as director of the intramural program.
In 1958, McHenry moved on to
Williams College, where he served as
lacrosse and football coach.

His next stop was in Lebanon
Valley, Pa., in 1961. He was named
director of athletics and chairman of
the department of physical education
at Lebanon Valley College. In 1971,
McHenry‘, came to Washington and
Lee, where he held the same jobs.

From 1973-77,- McHenry served
as, head football coach, during which
tiriie he guided the Generals to a 12-

resigned as football coach in order to
concentrate fully on his
administrative duties.

the affairs of the NCAA. He has
served on many NCAA committees,

William Grafton Young, an assis-
tant director of admissions and the
coordinator of minority recruitment at
W&L, resigned his position Wednes-
day to be an assistant basketball
coach at Eastern Tennessee State
University.

"I've grown very attached to
Washington and Lee since I came
here," said Young. “However, this is
a unique opportunity for me to get
back into coaching, and I'm anxious
to get started."

Associate Director of Admissions
Julia Kozak said,“We're obviously
very sorry to lose Grafton. He's done
an absolutely tremendous job for us
in the admissions office, and we'll
certainly miss him, no question
about that."

Young came to W&L in 1985 as
an assisstant to Generals Head Bas-
ketball Coach Verne Canfield, and
joined the admissions office two
years later.

Since Young was placed in
charge of’ minority recruitment in
1987, the number of applications
from minority students has risen
greatly, said-Kozak.

“This last year alone, there was a
23 percent increase in the number of
applications from minority students,"
Young said. “I think that indicates a
lot of the old attitudes about minority
students are slowly going away."

However, Young said, there is
still a lot of animosity toward minor-
ity students on campus.

"The fact is, when I'm talking
with a minority prospective student, I
have to be honest and tell him that
there are still some places where he
won't be accepted," said Young.
"Old habits die hard, but I think at-
titudes here will eventually change."
“When people see a black, or asian
face on campus, they automatically
think this kid must have gotten a
break (from the admissions office),
but our goal has never been to sacri-
fice the quality of the student body
just to have more minority represen-

Over the summer, McHemy asked
to take a leave of absence from the
university. The Board of Trustees
granted McHenry a one-year leave,
and he will return in the fall of 1990
to resume his duties as head of the
physical education department.

An eight-member committee of
university officials has been
appointed to name a replacement for
McHenry as athletic director. The
committee is headed by William
Watt, head of the chemistry
department. The other members are
Larry Boetsch, Associate Dean of the
College; Barry Machado, chairman of
the athletic committee; Cinda Rankin,
assistant athletic director; Gary
Fallon, head football coach; Tom
Jones, head athletic trainer; Richard
Miller, associate director of athletics
and physical education; and William
Hartog, director of admissions. Miller
and Hartog have input into the
interviews but do not vote on a
candidate. Miller will serve as
interim athletic director until a

replacement is named.

According to Kozak, the school
plans to hire an interim replacement
to serve out the rest of the year, and
then begin a "nationwide talent

The school has already offered
the interim job to an as yet unnamed
individual, said Kozak.

says an official police summary of Eben's
actions the day after the murders took place.

Then Eben fired a single shot in the
direction of an attending deputy. The shot
fell short, and police returned ﬁre.

Eben was hit by two bullets and “imme-

He was later pronounced dead on the scene.

Police believe Eben's final confrontation
with the police was probably a planned sui-
cide. Eben neither opened fire on the police

to take cover during the three hours of ne-
gotiations that followed.

The police’ killing of Eben was pro-

Lexington
to collect

student tax

Many may be able
to avoid paying

By Pat Lopes
Associate Editor

According to

This fall, the city of Lexington will, for the first
time, begin collecting personal property tax on cars
owned by Washington and Lee Virginia Military
students, but students whose cars are taxed elsewhere
may avoid the tax altogether.

Lexington Mayor H.E. “Buddy"

Derrick, the taxing of student cars is not the result of
any action by Lexington City Council. Instead, Baker
will be enforcing state tax laws.

"We're not out to say, ‘ah ha, we're out to jump on
these students and tax these students,"’ said Derrick.
“The law states that they should pay."

According to section 58.1 of the Virginia code, a
municipality can tax motor vehicles “normally garaged
or parked" within city limits.

However, the same statute also insures that car

owners cannot be taxed twice. The statute states that the

Said Miller, “We have started
interviewing prospective candidates,
and we expect that the interviews
will last into early October."

A replacement will be named as
soon as possible, added Miller.

On Aug. 30, the university
announced that Daly was being
reassigned.He had been the coach of
the Generals since 1984, when he
arrived from successful tenures at
Amherst and Middlebury. In his six
seasons with the Generals, Daly's
teams posted a record of 30-49. His
best season was in 1987, when the
Generals made it to the NCAA
Division III final four, posting an 11-
4 mark.

When asked about the
reassignment, Daly said,“l have no
comment at this time."

Daly will remain at W&L as an
assistant professor of physical
education and an assistant football
coach.

According to Miller, the fall
lacrosse season has been cancelled,
“because we don't want to waste
any of the practice days allowed by

gned

the NCAA. I feel that it would be a
waste of practices to go through the
fall with one coach and then have to
make the players adjust to a new
coach and new philosophies in the
spring."

To make up for not playing a fall
schedule, the starting date for spring
practice, which normally is February
1, will be moved up.

Until a new coach is named,
assistant coach Jim McKeon will
serve as interim head coach, handling
all of the lacrosse tearn’s off-season
business, including a meeting with all
returning and incoming lacrosse
players to explain the situation.

A new head coach will not be
named until after an athletic director
1S chosen.

Wilson firmly stated, however,
that, because the university currently
needs to ﬁll two positions in the
department, one person will not fill
both slots. The athletic director will
be named, and then he will go
through the process of naming a new
lacrosse coach, Wilson said.

Reward offered
by Scarboroughs

 

By Greg Euston
Editor

The parents of Mary Ashley Scar-
borough have offered a $5,000 re-
ward for any information leading to
the conviction of the driver responsi-
ble for the hit-and-rim accident that
left their daughter dead March 16.

Since the reward offer was made
public in late July, Lexington Police
have received about a dozen phone
calls, mostly from western Virginia,
but as far away as California. So far,
none of the leads have panned out,
Lexington Police Chief Bruce Beard
said Tuesday.

According to Beard, most callers
have seen cars that fit the general
description of the vehicle assumed to
be involved in the accident. Police
are looking for a 1987 metallic blue
Honda Accord, possibly with front-
end or windshield damage. The car is
also missing its horn cover — the
only piece of debris, aside from
ﬂecks of blue paint, found at the
scene.

Scarborough, then a W&L fresh-
man, was killed while walking along
East Washington Street, near the po-
lice station. She was 19 years old.

After the accident, Lexington Po-
lice began looking for the blue Hon-
da. Beard said he notified Honda of-
ficials and asked that any part orders
for this area be flagged for further
investigation.

“The university is working close-
ly with the Lexington Police Depart-
ment. in this matter," said Brian
Snaw Director of University Com-
niunications. Reward posters are be-
ing distributed to newspapers and
colleges in western Virginia through
Shaw's office.

Copies of the reward poster were
sent to police chiefs throughout the
state, Shaw added.

Officials have asked that anyone
with information about Scarborough's
death contact Beard at the Lexington
Police Department, 300 East Wash-
ington Street, Lexington, Virginia,
24450.

“ has the most impact on the readers?”
reporting classes, death is always in the first paragraph

 

A story hits home

Death is certain. That fact most of us have accepted.
But deaths among college—age students are always a
little more unexpected and little more surprising. And
in a student population of 1,500, a death affects
everyone because our college atmosphere allows a
certain intimacy between students, even between
students who are not friends. After a few years here
most of the names and faces are familiar to everyone.

However, death is also news. Hard news. Cold
news. And death is big news. Especially in a student
body of 1,500.

I was shocked when I first heard of the death of Dan
McDowell, for Dan was more than a familiar face to
me. When I learned of the tragedy this summer, I did
not at first consider it a news item for THE RING-
TUM PHI. I think that I immediately closed over the
news and tried to absorb it.

I even asked the person who notified me about Dan’s
death not to tell me any of the details surrounding the
murders. My own way of dealing with death is to blot
out images, soften hard facts. I knew who, but I didn’t
care about with what, when, where or why.

It is with this attitude intact that a fellow Ring-tum
Phi staffer, in talking about our plans for the first issue
of the Phi, mentioned that, of course, the story about
Dan’s death would be the lead story on page one.

I recoiled. That had never occurred to me, for Dan’s

go on an inside news page, or maybe we could run it
“below the fold” on the front page, or maybe we
didn’t have to run it at all, since the murder had not
taken place when school was in session.

Of course, after thinking about it, I realized that
Dan’s and his farnily’s deaths are a big news event and

V they would have to run on the front page. Everyone is

talking about it.

In our journalism classes we learn to look at news by
asking, “What is the most important item? What has
the most impact on the readers?” In our simulated
reporting classes, death is always in the first paragraph
by asking, “What is the most important item? What
In our simulated

of the story if it is a part of the story...or you get an F
for bad news judgement.

But I didn’t learn in my journalism classes how to
successfully remove my emotion from the manner in
which I handle the news around me. I didn’t learn
where to run a story’ about the horrible event murder of
a friend. I didn’t learn how to report the facts without
feeling like I was sensationalizing the matter. I can
only hope that I have learned now, and that our
decision to run the story of Dan’s death on page one
will be accepted by his close friends.

I have been pulled from my shell and I have been
forced to stare all details of his murder in the face. I
have also seen the media handle this story in
excrucitaing detail, down to gruesome facts that left
searing images in my mind.

I searched for the middle ground, and hope that I
will be considered neither less of a journalist nor less
of a humanitarian for the way I chose to handle this
story. I knew the name behind the face. I knew the guy
who loved to ski and spoke French with a beautiful
accent. I wish’ only that the news could somehow
portray who he was, and not Dan only as the victim of

a horrible crime.

Honor and what

it means

 

MY VIEW
By Todd Peppers

I am now entering my fourth year
at Washington and Lee. During the
last thirty-six months I have grappled
with some troubling inconsistencies
in our Honor System. I want to start
by saying that the Honor System is
one of the unique aspects of our in-
stitution. When I tell campus visi-
tors about our community of trust,
they express amazement over unlock-
ed dorm rooms and unsupervised ex-
ams. The Honor System is one of
the things I cherish most about
iwashington and Lee. Yet paradoxi-
cally, it is also the one subject which
Icauses the most confusion and sad-
.ness for me.

I am not the only person at

Washington and Lee who has
watched fellow students be banned
, permanently for honor offenses. Al-
though saddened by the loss of ac-
quaintances and friends, I understand
their actions led to the painful out-
come. My confusion arises when
other students, whom I perceive as
committing greater acts of dishonor-
able behavior, are allowed to return
to Washington, and Lee to graduate.
I am not using the Honor System to
call their behavior dishonorable. It is
my own set of moral values that la-
bel their actions as dishonorable.
Allow me to expand my thoughts.

The “White Book," the “bible"
of the W&L Honor System, says
“the freedom given to students stems
from the understanding that persons
attending this university will act
honorably." Washington and Lee stu-
dents have defined honorable actions
as those that do not involve lying,
cheating or stealing. The White
Book adds “the Honor System is
based on the ftmdamental principle
that a spirit of trust pervades all as-
pects of student life." The two key
words are HONOR and TRUST. We
trust our fellow students in the sense
that they will not commit these three
acts. But are we defining “honor"
too tightly? It seems at Washington
and Lee we have become hypnotized
by the words “lie, cheat or steal."
We are blinded by the fact that hon-
or can stretch beyond these three
words. I propose that our narrow
definition of honor is critically weak-
ening the Honor System.

I accept the‘premise that lying,
cheating V and stealing; are dishonorable
acts and should be punished by per-
manent expulsion. However, we
need to go one step further. Let's
put aside the Honor System for one
moment and consider the following
question: Using your own set of
personal values, not what the Honor
System tells us, which would you

a candy bar from Kroger, or, 2) sell-
ing drugs in our community? Both
actions break existing laws. And the
two actions can lead to punishment.
My set of values indicates that sell-
ing drugs is a greater evil than steal-
ing candy. I also believe society
agrees with my viewpoint by assign-
ing drug dealers harsher penalties
than those assigned to shoplifters.
Do you agree?

Now we need to place the two
crimes within the parameters of our
Honor System. Cannot one make the
legitimate claim that the students of
Washington and Lee consider shop-
lifting a greater crime than dealing
drugs? If a Washington and Lee
student is found guilty in an Honor
Trial of stealing a candy bar, then
the only punishment is permanent
expulsion from the school-
Washington and Lee student is con-
victed in a court of selling drugs,
and serves the entire sentence, then
he or she can retum to our school.
Stop and ask yourself: do you
believe it is fair to expel the shoplift-
er and allow the drug dealer to
return?

If a

A dangerous and incorrect conclu-
sion can be made from my line of
reasoning. I am not trying to prove
that any actions which break laws of
the state are dishonorable. Speeding
tickets and jaywalking are not suffi-
cient reasons for removing a student
from school.

My conclusion is we have an
Honor System at Washington and
Lee that, as a piece of machinery,
functions quite well. Every student
is well versed on the procedures gov-
erning honor trials, the rights of the
accused and the punishment for the
guilty. Those are the cogs of our
mechanism. Yet, for the machinery
to work, a definition of honor must
be provided. The definition that the
student body is using— by focusing
on lying, cheating and stealing - has
critically weakened the Honor
System's original intentions.

Read the White Book carefully.
It states, “Although honorable con-
duct cannot be codified, lying, cheat-
ing and stealing are clear examples
of breaches of the Honor System.
The system applies to any conduct
considered dishonorable by the stu-

dent generation involved."

The key phrase is "ANY CON-

DUCT CONSIDERED DISHONOR-
ABLE BY THE STUDENT GENER-
ATION INVOLVED." [caps mine]
I used the selling of drugs for an
example of conduct we might label
as dishonorable. We shouldn't stop
there. I suggest our “student genera-
tion" start asking themselves some
key questions: is date rape a dishon-
orable act? Are deliberate actions
that cause bodily harm dishonorable?
And what of selling illegal sub-
stances? qr drunk driving that re-
sults in the death of another?

The goal of my paper is not to
whip the student body into a frenzy.
My point is not to suggest that un-
derage drinking is an honor offense -
— there are much greater issues to
consider. I call upon this "student
generation" to take a close look at
the deﬁnition of honor on our cam-
pus. Can we be proud of the evolu-
tion of the honorable “Washington
and Lee gentlemen?" We often
evoke the ghost of Robert E. Lee
when we speak of our school — is

Family travels

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

Back somewhere in history, after the earth was
formed from planetary jello-fragments and before
geologists began eating their laboratory samples
for lunch, a newspaper man named Frank devel-
oped the Golden Rule of Journalism: “If you
want to avoid getting poisoned or stabbed in your
sleep never write critical stories about your rela-
tives unless they're dead or too far away to harm
you physically.”

Since all of my relatives are currently in other
states and countries, I feel safe enough to begin
discussing a recent family trip to Africa. But be-
fore we get to Africa (literally,_ if you're having
hallucinations like mine) let me share some start-
ling family history. Descended from Jewish
Russians, I am the only son in a family of six; I
have three sisters - Tami, Karyn and Shannon.
Tami, the oldest one, is married to a Southern
Baptist from Florida. Karyn, the second oldest,
was married this past summer, to_ a moslem from
Morocco who has a French Catholic mother.
Shannon, my twin, is currently single although I
expect she will soon armounce her engagement to
a Native American Indian with Buddhist grandpar-
ents.

my strange family situation, I can get to my Afri-
can trip.

After surviving a grueling American wedding
in May, my family traveled to Morocco in North
Africa for a Moroccan ceremony in late July. My
brother-in-law, Kareem “Abdul—Jabaar” Tahiri is
from Casablanca, so naturally our Moroccan expe-
rience began there. Although the word “Casa-
blanca" tends to evoke romantic images involving
the horrnone-laden actor Humphrey Bogart, a
more accurate representation would involve me,
weak firm jet lag and chronic diarrhea, sitting in
a restaurant that is hotter than a sauna, trying to
find something on a menu that does not involve
eating sheep brains.

Like most stupid tourists in foreign countries,
my family spent a great deal of time traveling
great distances to look at camels, palaces and
other arbitrary objects which look impressive in
post cards but inevitably turn out to be excruciat-
ingly boring. Also, no matter where we went
(even if it was in the middle of the Sahara), a
horde of fully mobile merchants, speaking broken
English, were always at our side. These walking
thrift shops would follow us around for hours

insisting we buy useless trinkets\. And because I

wanted nothing more then to be left alone by '

these parasitic entrepreneurs, I bought every trin-
ket in sight. Trinkets I brought all the way
across the Atlantic in carry on luggage to store in
the back of the garage until my Mom forces me
at gun point to take them to the Salvation Army.

Compounding the problem of the t:rinket-wield-
ing mobile merchants was my immediate family
which carmot go more than five minutes without
experiencing some type of intra-farnily distur-
bance. Though these disturbances norrnally come *
in the form of verbal arguments or temper tan-_
trums, at one point, the family broke up into
teams and had a bench clearing brawl. A major
cause of family tension is that between my three
sisters and Mother, at any given moment. one of
them is afflicted with PMS. PMS, which literally
means "Periodic Mental Sickness," is a psycho-
logical state of mind occurring monthly in fe-
males. It is generally characterized by anti-social
behavior, violent mood swings, and sudden trips
to the drug store.

Due to space limitations and the fact that I'm

sick of writing, I must end this article now. In ',

TAX

from page 1

the city cannot tax a car if the owner
can show “sufficient evidence” that
property tax has been paid on that
vehicle in another locality. That

‘locality may be in Virginia or in
another state.

Local residents pay the city $5.50
for every $100 of the assessed value
of their car, a rate that City Manager
Joe King said may also be applied to
cars driven by local students.

In the past Lexington‘s city
council has overlooked strict
application of this code to W&L and
VMI students, but budget constraints
are forcing the council to increase its
tax base, said Derrick.

The mayor pointed out that 60
percent of the property in Lexington
is non-taxable, and that most of that
property is owned by W&L and
VMI. “It seems unfair to continue to
raise taxes on 40 percent of the
property," said Derrick.

“Students that are here for nine
months are citizens for nine
months," he continued. He said
that, since students utilize roads, the
police and other city services offered
to citizens. students virtually are
citizens. Accordingly, Derrick said
students should help support the
services they utilize.

But King emphasized that the
provision barring double taxation
does have some stipulations. First,
only payment of a personal property
tax at home, not any other sort of
tax related to ownership of a car,
will exempt students from taxation in
Lexington, he said.

Second, he said students must pay
the city the difference if the car tax
paid in their hometown is less that
the car tax levied in Lexington.

Third, all students, whether or not
they will be taxed, must register their
cars with the city of Lexington. At

Shaw visited the campus last

either be exempted from taxation or
required to make a payment.

Lexington Commissioner of
Revenue Courtney Baker will work
with the W&L administration this fall
to inform students that all cars must
be registered with the city and to
track down students who fail to
comply. “State law requires that
people register," said King. “But if
the commissioner is aware of
unregistered property, he can still
assess and tax that property.

“We’re hoping that everyone will
come forward," he continued. “If
they don't, I'm sure the council will
say we want this code to be followed
to the law." Derrick and King both
said students who fail to register
their cars will be breaking existing
Virginia law.

Dean John to take year off,

By Lee Fleming
Staff Reporter

Lewis John, who has served as dean of students at
Washington and Lee since 1969, will resign from that
position at the end of this academic year.

John. who also serves as a professor of politics, will
take a one year sabbatical during the 1990-91 year
before rejoining the faculty in the university’s School of

Commerce, Economics and Politics.

A 1958 graduate of W&L, John said there was no

single reason behind his decision.

“A number of long-range plans have come to an end,
” he said. “It just seemed like a good time."

University President John D. Wilson said John had
“been talking about it for a number of years.”

Wilson said a university search committee, chaired by
Director of Admissions William M. Hartog III, will
conduct “a national search" for a new dean of students.
The committee will also include three students, he said.

John earned a master's degree from Princeton
University and a doctorate from Syracuse University.

In an effort to ease the burden of
nish on freshmen. the Interfraternity
Council has reduced the number of
open houses from 12 to nine, council
president Kevin Nash said Monday.

Freshmen will sign up Sunday for
the nine houses of their choice, but a
computer program will randomly se-
lect the order in which rushees attend
the open houses. The first four rush
dates will be handled in a similar
fashion, with the computer matching
rushees’ preference cards to each fra-
ternities’ preference lists.

“The IFC decided to have no
more than nine open houses because
people were skipping the last three,"

Nash said. Rushees must attend at
least six open houses and a minimum
of five rush dates. Bids may be ex-
tended at the fifth rush date.

Associate Dean of Students for
Greek Affairs, Leroy C. “Buddy"
Atkins said he hopes the random or-
dering will alleviate some of the
pressure on freshmen to make defini-
tive first and second choices.

“It hurt the freshmen when they
signed up for a later nish date and
not the first or second." he said.
Not knowing the fraternities try to
gauge a freshman's interest and pre-
ference by how high he places a
house's msh date, often times rushees
get left out in the cold, he said.

“It's embarassing for a freshman
to be left standing ‘in a house expect-
ing a bid, and not getting one while

IFC restructures rush

they are being given out all around
him," Nash said.

“There have not been any prob-
lerns since everyone‘: been back,"
he said. “We've made it crystal
clear that we expect everyone to
abide by the rides. No house is go-
ing to get away with repeated viola-
tions this year."

To build a better working
relationship between the fraternities.
the IFC held a casual meeting Mon-
day to allow all of the house presi-
dents to becorrie acquainted and to
reinforce adherence to rush guide-
lines, Nash said.

“It would be the death penalty
for a fraternity to lose rush pn've-
leges. No one wants to see their life-
blood disappear, but it could be an
altemative," Nash said. '

Bio major interns with DOE

From News Releases

Washington and Lee senior Delia Faytli Truett was\
one of 80 students to take part in the U.S. Department
of Energy's Student Research Participation program this
surrirner. The program is operated by Oak Ridge Associ-
ated Universities‘ SciencelEngineering Education Divi-
sion.

Truett, a biology major from Friendsville, Tenn..
conducted her research at Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory. During her 10-week appointment in the Chemical
Technology Division, Truett studied enzymological pro-
cessing of lignocellulosic substrates.

“Part of DOE's mission is to encourage student
interest in technical and scientific research and develop-
ment," Dr. Richard Wiesehuegel, program director said.
“The SRP program is an important vehicle for doing
that. The program lets us attract capable students in
science, math, computer science and engineering to meet
current and future labor market demands," Wiesehuegel
said, “and this becomes crucial when projections iridi-
cated fewer students are choosing academic programs in
science and engineering."

On a day-to-day basis students such as Truett con-
duct research on state-of-the—art equipment using ad-
vanced energy technologies under the guidance of DOE
and DOE laboratory staff. but it's the real-world work
environment that makes the impact. Comments from
students include statements such as “gained a better

view of the inner workings of groups and group dynam-
ics; ' "more aware of the importance of innovation.
d°di°ﬁli0n. and Pl’id¢;" “gained an extensive knowledge
of project -management policies and procedures;" and
"the most interesting aspect of the SRP research experi-
ence‘has been simply observing the steps involved in
carrying out the research in general."

The effects of the program are best summed up by
former students, Wiesehuegel said. “We have had more
than 2,000 participants since 1958. and statistics indicate
that 54 percent of former SRP participants work today in
research--mne percent of them in a federal government
facility," Wiesehuegel said. “Students still tell us the
program gives me some ideas as to what areas to ex-
plore in graduate school. and of course, this is part of
DOE's mission." 1

_ _T_he SRP program is open to graduate and upper
division undergraduate students majoring in engineering,
physical and life sciences. mathematics, computer science
or the social sciences. Applications outnumber appoint-
ments by about four to one, making competition strong
among candidates who possess the potential for success-
ful scientiﬁc careers.

The return

of the

wooden nickel

By Cary Baber
Staff Reporter

Three years ago the W&L Food
Service created point cards as an
alternative to the 20—meal plan. The
following year the Co-op began ac-
cepting points and business skyrock-
eted. Originally, one could pay for
an “odd" purchase, such as $1.45,
only by having one and a half points
taken off or by having one and a
quarter points taken off and paying
20 cents out of pocket.

Last year “as a service to the
students," said the University Food
Service Director Gerald Darrell, the
Co-op added “five cents a.ltema-
tives,“ ranging from bubble gum to
lollipops to peppermint patties, as
another option to maximize the effi-
ciency of the point card system. And
now, the W&L Food Service has
added a fourth option--tlre wooden
nickel.

The idea of a token to be used in
the Co-op and the GHQ belongs to
Rick Armstrong, manager of the Co-
op. The W&L Food Service had the

reusable tokens made at a cost of '

“one or two cents, a negligible a-
mount,” said Darrell, “to keep up
with students‘ requests.”

Another new addition to the Food
Service will be Washington and Lee
insulated travel mugs.

During the month of August, the
Food Service used approximately 800
styrofoam cups each day. Because
styrofoain is not biodegradable, many
other universities have converted to
paper cups. The W&L Food Service
has decided to respond to this envi-
ronmental issue, while at the same
time reducing drink prices, by selling
a reusable cup. The cups will be on
sale in front of the Co-op tomorrow
from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. for $2.50, bev-
erage included.

Beginning Monday, the mugs will
be sold for $2.50 without beverage.
Reﬁlls. excluding milk, orange juice.
and alcoholic beverages, will cost 50
cents for as long as one owns the
mug. The mugs are self-service and
strictly non-transferrable.

Wooden nickels and insulated
travel mugs are signs that the W&L
Food Service has it's eye on the fu-
ture. And, the nickels are the next

step towards a “cashless society," a‘

concept centering around a debit card
that can be used for purchases in the
co-op. bookstore, GHQ, Dining Hall
and serve as an ID card for the li-
brary and certain other university

The number of burglaries of cars
and residences of W&L students is
expected to be unusually high this
weekend as fraternity rush gets
underway this weekend, said
Lexington Police Chief Bruce Beard
at the Interfratemity Council meeting
Tuesday night.

“We're going to see a big
increase in the number of larcenies
this weekend," said Beard. “They
(the burglaries) usually happen during
parties, especially when so many
houses are throwing parties at once."

“Please encourage all members of
the student body to remove all of
their valuables from their cars and to
lock their apartments," Beard said.
"Also, please make sure that students

A new law enacted by the Vir-
ginia State Legislature this summer
enables the courts to suspend the dri-
vers license of anyone convicted of
tmderage possession of alcohol, As-
sociate Dean of Students Leroy
“Buddy" Atkins said at the Inter-
fraternity Council meeting Tuesday
night.

If a person under the age of 16 is
convicted of underage possession of
alcohol, the court can prevent him
from obtaining his license for six
months, said Atkins. If the person is

visiting from other schools do the
same."

Beard said the police offer to

conduct, upon request, a “safety
inspection" of any house or
apartment to determine its

vulnerability to a potential burglar.

“These inspections will help you
keep your things safe and they'll
help us prevent these kinds of
crimes," Beard said.

Beard also outlined the new.
tougher amplified sound regulations.
Now if a fraternity receives a noise
violation,a citation from the police
for illegally loud noise, the house
will not be given a permit for such
loud noise for one week. in addition
to whatever penalties are levied by
either the courts or the IFC.

“We're going to be very fair and
consistent about how we enforce this

between 16 and 21, he can have his
license suspended for six months.

“I don't know to what extent this
law will be enforced," said Atkins.
“But you probably shouldn’t prance
down the middle of the road with
your 12-pack under your arm."

Atkins stressed that such new
laws compel fraternities to reevaluate‘
their policies for distributing alcohol
at parties.“If we get only one thing
accomplished this year, let's make
sure you (fraternities) understand that
you just can't give out alcohol to
people at parties," Atkins said. “You
just can't afford to be in the beer
business anymore."

day of spring term exams ended, but
he also said “We're really not
exactly sure who did it."

Nevertheless, under the terms of
the probation, Atkins said that, by
Oct. 1, the chapter “must identify
the members responsible for the
vandalism of the house. take
appropriate internal disciplinary
measures against them and assist the
house corporation in completing
necessary repairs."

On Wednesday, the living room
and entrance hall at the Phi Delt
house had already been repainted,
and Holland said painting and re-
carpeting upstairs would also soon be
completed. He said he was confident
his fraternity would make the Oct. 1
deadline for repairs.

Atkins said the deadline for
compliance with the university’s
Standards is the beginning of spring
term, when “there will be a hearing
to determine the chapter’s future at
Washington and Lee." But Atkins
said that, “under conditions of
unusual progress” and with the
approval of the Phi Delt house
corporation. the hearing may be held
as soon as Jan. 29. Holland said he's
confident his fraternity will be ready
to for a hearing at that time.

Chapter advisor Joseph Goldsten,
who is also on the board of Phi
Delt's house corporation, agreed with
Atkins that conditions at the house at
the end of the 1989-90 were
“unacceptable.“ But he said the
decision to hire a house mother is
not punitive action and called that
move “a positive approach."

“We want to make survival and
growth under the Renaissance work,"

he said, referring to W&L's
Fraternity Renaissance, the program
to restore the school's fraternity
houses that led to the adoption of the
Standards.

Under the Renaissance program.
all houses which are renovated by
the university will have to hire a
resident manager, Goldsten pointed
out. And he predicted that most
houses will hire house mothers to fill
that role. “The sooner we get in line
the better,” he said.

Mata McGuire, a former restaurant
owner who was the house mother at
W&L's chapter of Zeta Beta Tau for
six years, was hired by the Phi Delt
house corporation over the summer.
Goldsten said she, in addition to
living in the house, will attend all
house activities. But, he said, she
will not be a chaperon; for example,
she may choose to attend only part
of a party at the house, he said.

Although she has only just begun
her duties, McGuire said she doesn't
see any problems.

“I expected resentment,"
McGuire said, because of the
circumstances under which she was
hired. “But the boys seem very
responsible. I haven't seen a bad
apple in the bunch."

Atkins emphasized that the
probation Phi Delt is under is not the
result of any action by the
Interfratemity Council. He said
Tuesday that it is possible that the
IFC will also take action against Phi
Delt, but Holland, who is a member
of the IFC’s Judicial Board,
Wednesday told the Phi that the IFC
will not take any action against his
fraternity.

new policy," said Beard. “However,
the decision about whether to close
down a party is up to the discretion
of the officer on the scene."

Although noise permits extend
until midnight, Beard said, an officer
has the option to close the party
down before then if he considers the
party to be “out of control."

“The only problem I leave with
that is the possibility that a house
could be cleared of a noise violation
in court, would the house still not be
able to receive a noise permit?"
asked IFC Vice—I-‘resident Hunt

_ Washington and Lee University
students, faculty and Lexington
residents experienced firsthand Soviet
perestroika last year when three
Soviet exchange students attended
. W&L. This year, the Russian studies
program will be further developed by
new faculty member Zhanna
Dologopolova.

W&L contacted Dologopolova at
a teacher's conference in Washington,
» D.C. last December. After visiting

It’s as if I entered a fairy tale,"
Dologopolova said. She has explored
much of Lexington on foot, as she
enjoys walking.

She will teach first- and third-
year Russian and the Russian
literature in translation course. In
addition to teaching, Dologopolova
will help prepare W&L students for
exchange trips to the Soviet Union.
Last year, a group of W&L students
travelled to the Soviet Union for the
ﬁrst time, as a part of the exchange
program that brought Soviet students
here.

Dologopolova says she would
love to return to the Soviet Union to
visit, but would not retum there to
live.

Last season, Old Dominion Athletic Conference prog-
nosticators picked the Washington and Lee Generals to
finish fifth in the conference. The Generals responded ‘by
finishing the season 5-3-1, tied for third in the confer-
ence. The Generals ended the season with a foungzime
winning streak.

The 1939 Generals will be hard pressed to prove that
last year's performance was no fluke. The will need
healthy contributions from the 35 returning lctterwinners
from last year's squad to improve on last year's record.
Head coach Gary Fallon is excited about what this year's
team is capable of doing.

And for good reason.

Offensively, both starting quarterback Philip Sampson
and backup Chris Srnythe, senior roommates, are back to
guide the Generals again. Sampson started in the Ge-
nerals’ two-quarterback system and completed 55 percent
of his passes for over 1,000 yards. Smythe, primarily a
scrambler, completed an outrageous 77 percent of his
passes (27-35).

Back are junior tailback Mason Pope and senior full-
back Russell Crosby, a two-year starter. They were last
year's top two rushers. Pope took the ball into the end
zone five times. Although both are experienced, they will
shoulder almost all of the Generals _ground work. "We
don't have a lot of depth in the backfield as far as
experience is concerned,"said Fallon. “We’ll work Kirk
Sohonage at both fullback and tailback this year.”

When Sampson and Smythe throw the ball this season,
they will be throwing to an experienced, deep group of
[fleet-footed receivers. On one side, juniors Craig Irons
and Chris Acebal will share the split end spot. Irons led
the team in receptions and receiving yards last year. On
the other side will be junior speedster Carl Gilbert, an

Polo ready despite losses

From W&L Sports Information

There are two ways to look at
dire straits. It can either be the
end of your world, or, especially
if you're Washington and Lee
water polo coach, it can be the
start of a new one.

With what Remillard is facing
for the upcoming season, he
easily could be preparing his
samurai sword. Gone are the
team's top three offensive threats
from the last two years. Departed
seniors Dave Dietz, Dave Reavy
and Moose Herring — all three of
whom were all-conference first-
team selections in '88 -
accounted for 134 of the
Generals’ 178 goals last year.
Reavy and Dietz also were named
All—Americans for the second
year in a row.

That, however, is the past.
And while the loss of 75 percent
of your offense in one fell swoop
might seem like a good reason
for an exit stage left, Remillard is
happy right where his team is.

“Whenever you have large
losses from graduation, you have
mixed feelings," he said. “Sure,
you're losing some talent, but it's
also exciting opportunity for some
underclassmen to move into
bigger roles.

“I'm very excited about our
recruits and the people we have
coming back. I think this group
is going to surprise people with
how quickly they blend into that
higher level. There will be no
superstars. We will have to rely
on each player to reach all of his
potential."

While the losses might lead
people to believe the Generals
will field a team of relative no-
names for 1989, nothing could be
further from the truth. The
strength, most certainly, will be
defense. Senior David Olson,
arguably one of the top three or
four goalies in the East last year,
is back again as W&L‘s final line
of defense. Playing primarily in
the deep end, Olson made 77
saves last year.

The Generals also will benefit
from some developing young
talent that now will have to come
to the fore. Sophomore Alan
Herrick showed signs of
becoming one of W&L‘s best-
ever defensive players last year,
and Remillard is expecting him to

Now, head coach Susan Dittman
and her team want more.

Dittman, who led the Generals to
a fifth-place finish in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference last
year, said she was pleasantly
surprised by last year's results and is
ready for new challenges this year.

True, W&L will sorely miss the
services of departed seniors Vanessa
Hartman (All-ODAC), co-captain
Melissa Thrasher and triple threat
Amy Smith. But the returnees could
more than make up for the
departures. Leading the way is two-
year team MVP Lisa Jay, a junior

“This year we can legitimize Beth Anne Lamb and junior Kliainla

contributions.

Dittrnari, is experience. Even with the

The Generals will need to
find some goal—scorers, though.
Only five players who actually
scored a goal last year return to
this year's team. Of the returnees,
Smith and Davis could be the
most promising future scorers.
Smith was a high school All-
American in water polo, while
Davis was a three-year lettennan
in water polo at California's
Sunny Hills High School.

Some needed punch should
come from the incoming recruits,
as well, Remillard said.

Hodges and senior J.Wayne Burris.

Gilbert will also handle the kick—off returns. In his
freshman year, Gilbert.retumed a kick-off 95 yards for a
touchdown against Randolph-Macon.

The offensive line is where the Generals were hardest
hit by graduation. Said Fallon, “We graduated four
people on the offensive line who played a lot of foot-
ball. Mike Magoline and Mike Holiefield alternated at
left guard. At right guard, Julian Philips (All-ODAC) is
gone, and at right tackle, David Surface (All-ODAC) is
gone as well. We have to find replacements for them.

"We'll probably be bigger on the offensive line this
year, but I'm not sure we've got the seasoning that we
had last year."

Juniors Rob Christensen and Frank Sudell will anchor
the line this season. They should receive help from
sophomores Jim Henry and Rob Thomas, juniors Rob
Robertson and Mike DeMelfi and senior Rich Poli.

Defensively, despite the loss of two All-Americans, the
Generals look strong. Last season W&L gave up just
over two touchdowns a game. All-Americans Jim John-
son (DT) and Tom Skeen (LB, P), bolstered the defense.
Skeen is second in interceptions on W&L‘s career list.
He led the team in tackles for three years. Also gone is
LB-DT Hughes Melton. Melton had seven tackles for
losses last season, third on the team.

But don't fret for the Generals yet. Back is the entire
starting secondary, including all—ODAC selections Bland
Warren and Bobby Rimmer, both senior comerbacks.
Joining them will be junior safeties Clark “Boomer"
Wight and Brad Miller. The entire secondary from last
year was in the top ten in tackles. Wight was second on
the team in interceptions last season. Two freshmen
should also see time in the secondary this year, Juarez
Newsome at strong safety and Don Dempsey at free
safety.

The defensive line will be anchored by tackles Dave
Radulovic and Scott Silverman, who led all returning
linemen in tackles last year. Also back to shore up the
defense is stand-out linebacker Mike Pack, who was
second on the team in tackles.

Said Fallon, “We won't be very big on the defensive

,.. 

said her 1989 club already should
have more volleyball experience than
any other team she's had.

“Our offensive system has been
put in," Dittman said. “We won't
have to spend so much time trying to
figure out who goes where. We
certainly have the potential to be
better than we've been. The players
we have coming in to the team are
even better players than we've had in
the past, and they're all definitely
more experienced."

The healthy stock on hand has
Dittman ready for some tangible
improvement. The Generals finished
fifth in the ODAC regular season,
but injuries during the ODAC
Tournament made getting to the
semifinals a near impossibility. This
year, Dittman would like to see her
team work its way into the top four
in the conference.

"It will be very challenging to try
to finish third," she said. “The
conference is getting more and more
strong coaches that will make for
more and more strong teams. But we
deﬁnitely want to move up one or
two places in the standings. I think
the character of the W&L student,

pcong year :

line, but we'll have the quickest ends I've seen in my
twelve years here."

Occupying one end will be John McCal1um, a sopho— '7

more. At the other end will be junior Caner Quayle.
Backing them up will be converted defensive back Scott
Williamson.

“We're’not overly big on our line,_but we are real _
heavy on hustle and effort and attitude," said Fallon.

Aiding Pack at linebacker will be sophomore Trey
Cox, who, according to Fallon, has shown signs -of _
becoming a strong linebacker.

Another returning weapon the Generals will be looking
forward to utilizing is junior placekicker Carter Quayle.
Quayle, a junior, earned All-America status last season
by connecting on 10 of 12 field goals and scoring a
team-high 44 points.

However, Quayle will have to deal with a new rule.
This season, kickers are not allowed to use tees on ﬁeld
goals and extra points. .

Another new rule that will come into play this year
deals with penalties on the defense _on plays where the
offense scores a touchdown. In the past. the touchdown
would count and the penalty be assessed on the kickoff.
Now the offense has the option to enforce the penalty on ,
the extra point, moving the ball half to distance to th
goal or enforce it on the kickoff. The new rule coupl
with the no-tee rule could induce an increase in th
number of two—point conversions attempted by team
around the country.

Fallon says his team is ready for this season's opener
at Emory and Henry. Said Fallon, "We try to take it I,
one game at a time. We want to block out all the other

The brutal slate, which includes 11

the Generals overall record, but it
shouldn't disrupt their level of

And that foundation could be the

From W&L Sports Information

With the 1988 season having
produced four All-Old Dominion
Athletic Conference players. including
the school's first—ever first-team
selection in the sport, as well as
ODAC Coach-of-the-Year honors for
head coach Janine Hathom, the
outlook for the Washington and Lee
women's soccer 1989 season could
be termed bright. ‘

Even Hathom, whose program is
in just its third year of play in the
ODAC, is willing to admit the
immediate future looks very bright.

“I really can't wait for this
season to get started,” said the
Generals‘ third-year coach. “We have
a lot of work to do, but I think it
should be a lot of fun, too. We've
had so much growth so far. I'm
really excited about our potential. I
think our ‘skill level could be another
level above last year."

The reason for such excitement is
the return of 13 lettermen, along with
a promising group of freshmen. Back
are defensive standouts Sarah Allen,
Beth Stutzmarm and Nancy Mitchell.
Both Allen, a senior. and Mitchell, a
sophomore, were All—ODAC
selections, and Mitchell, W&L‘s
Female Freshman Athlete-of-the-Year
last year, was a first-team All-ODAC
selection, a first-time honor for a
W&L women's soccer player.

“Once again we should be strong
defensively," Hathom said. “My
coaching philosophy is to emphasize
defense, and we have some very
strong players there again."

just as much a source of confidence.
Junior Sherri Brown, who played
every minute of last season in goal
for the Generals, is back. She made
169 saves last year and allowed just
2.75 goals per game.

The forward line also should be
strong for the coming season. The
Generals return six of their top seven
scorers from the 1988 season,
including senior Catherine Baillio.
W&L‘s leading‘ scorer each of the
last two seasons. Sophomore Ashley
Gray, the second—leading scorer for
the Generals last fall, and senior
Joelle Jackson, a co-captain along
with Allen, should bolster W&L‘s
offensive attack.

Hathom said the area of concern
will be midfield. Only two proven
performers, sophomore letterwinner
Morgan Warner and junior reserve
Paige Kilian, are back for 1989.
Warner, who started 15 of 16 games
last season, was third on the team in
scoring last season, while Kilian saw
action in 14 games in 1988.

With the defensive and offensive
strengths already on reserve, Hathom
knows the 1989 season could be

another turning point for the young
W&L women's soccer program. In
1987. W&L‘s first year of play in
the ODAC, the Generals went 2-8-3.
Last year, the Generals were a game
shy of .500, recording a 7-9 record
and finishing fourth in the ODAC
regular season. The Generals were
edged by Sweet Briar in the first
round of the ODAC Tournament, but
the remarkable turnaround earned
Hathom ODAC Coach of the Year
honors.

Improving will be made even
more difficult by a challenging 1989
schedule. There will be nary a rest
stop throughout the 17-game regular-
season slate.

“Our schedule is going to be
really tough,“ Hathom said. “There
will be no game that's going to be
easy. There should be some games
we should be able to win, and there
will be some games where we will
have to work hard just to get into a
position to win. But I think this
group is up for that challenge.
They're very excited and gung-ho.

They’re ready for that level of
competition. ' '
Making the future look even

brighter is a promising group of
freshman. Twelve first-year players
are looking to make contributions
right away, and Hathom says some
will have a chance to do just that.

The Generals also will need some
leadership, and Hathom is confident
in her returning veterans, especially
captains Jackson and Allen, to supply
the guidance her team of 21
underclassmen will need.

And where the Generals could be
is the upper echelon of the ODAC.
Hathom is willing to be patient, but
she can't dampen her enthusiasm for
the 1989 campaign.

“We're going to have more of a
shot this year," she said. “We could
end up surprising some of the upper
echelon teams. I'd like to shoot for
the top three in the conference. That
would be nice. But we have a lot of
the finer details to work on. It's a lot
of pressure in a way, but pressure
makes diamonds, doesn't it?"

From W&L Sports Information

Heavy casualties due to
graduation, a murderous schedule,
and the prospect of an expanded and
soccer-strengthened Old Dominion
Athletic Conference await head coach
Rolf Piranian and his Washington
and Lee men's soccer team in 1989.

Piranian, who enters his 14th
season as the W&L soccer boss, is
not crying the blues, however. He
likes his players, and with a few
breaks along the way, he also likes
their chances at making a run for the
conference title.

The potential for Piranian is to
shed tears of dismay. Gone arefive
senior starters, including co-captain
and All-ODAC back Sid Udicious,
co-captain Mike Veliuona and leading
scorer Johnny Sarber. The five
departures took with them 20 years
of collegiate soccer experience and
18 varsity letters.

But it's all water under the bridge
for Piranian. With a schedule that
includes some of the top-ranked
teams in the nation and a brutal
conference slate, there's no time to
worry about the past. The 16-date
schedule is dotted with traditional
regional strongmen like Guilford,
Mary Washington and North Carolina
Wesleyan, in addition to an early-
season weekend two-fer in Baltimore
against Johns Hopkins and Camegie-
Mellon.

Six seniors should ﬁgure
prominently in the W&L fortunes in
1989, and leading that group is two-
year starter Patrick Brown, who holds
the W&L all—time record for assists
and was the Generals‘ leading scorer
in 1987. Joining Brown on the list of

teams with the addition of, former

at working their way up to the top
of the heap in the ODAC will be
those veterans, along with a host of
talented younger players and
newcomers. As a freshman last
season, midfielder David Hooker had
three goals and one assist in 13
games, and he is expected to
strengthen the midfield along with
sophomore letterrnan David De Falco.

Up front, the Generals should get
support from junior David Gilmore,
who had two goals and two assists in
eight games last season before being
sidelined with injuries, and
sophomore lettermen Bobby
Weisgerber and Chris Miyamoto. In
addition to Caggiano and Eckman,
the W&L defense should be bolstered
by two lettermen, junior Duke Dillard
and sophomore John Miller.

There also is a strong group of
freshmen slated to arrive in

Piranian said.

If all pans out and the breaks are
with the Generals, the early warning
signals for the ’89 season may not
yield any discouraging results.
Piranian likes the opportunities the
upcoming campaign holds.

“We're the only ODAC team to
lose players to graduation this year,
so we might not get much respect,"
he said. “But we had a good three
weeks of spring practice. So if we
can answer some questions early, we
can be a real decent club."

Paradise opens its gates to Lexington

Local merchant combines shopping with metaphysical concepts

 

By Genienne Mongno
Associate Editor

If you‘re in the mood to shop,
browse or just relax in a stress-free
enviomment — go to Paradise.

Paradise, located at 16 N. Main
St., opened its gates to Lexington on
Aug.29 as a gift shop specializing in
metaphysical merchandise.

All the items in the store,
including a variety of crystals,
incense, New Age music and books
on personal growth and development,
are intended to be spiritually
uplifting. However, Paula Weiss, who
owns the store with her husband
Steve Martin, said the store isn't
purely a metaphysical shop. Paradise
also features a selection of cards,
stuffed toys, jewelry. candles, and
clothing.

“Basically it’s just a fun gift
shop, but undemeath that is a lot of
love and a lot of spiritual presence,"
said Weiss.

Weiss, who with Martin
directed a center for well—beir1g in
Pennsylvania before coming to
Lexington, said she was told a store

like Paradise would not be successful
with the largely conservative student
population at Washington and Lee.

“I think today‘s students,
including the Washington and Lee
students I've observed. are unique
and individual and want to be
accepted as individuals and to do
their own thing," she said.

“They're exploring and they're
very alive. That's my perception and
that’s one of the reasons I decided to
go ahead with the store."

' Weiss said she also believes
there , is a strong undercurrent of
interest in spiritual matters in the
Rockbridge area.

“Everywhere you go there are
normal people — and I'm not talking
spaced out California people — but
normal housewives (who are
interested)" she said.

Weiss said so far her gamble
has paid off. Business has been “far
beyond" her expectations and she
said people from “every level of
community here" are showing

interest in the store.
“There's something for everyone,
that’s how we wanted to make it."

Above, Weiss shows J.Scott Fowler how to get the most bell for his
buck. At right, one feature at Paradise includes a peaceful seating
area centered around a heavily toliaged water fountain. The area is
open to anyone who ventures in. Staff photos by Cary Baber.

she said.

"the merchandise in Paradise
comes from all over the world so
certain items are truly one of a kind,
said Weiss. She said she buys for the
store by trying to “look through the
eyes of the students and tourists"
and is also open to suggestions from
customers about what they would
like to see.

Weiss said she also tries to keep
most of the items in an affordable
price range.

“You don’t want a store that
people are only able to come in and
look at like a museum. You want
them to come in, have fun and know
they can have anything in the store,”

she said.

Paradise is also a place where
people can go “just to be in the
space," said Weiss.

‘Customers are invited to relax in
a seating area centered around a
fountain and exotic plants.

“I'm interested in something
different, something that’s exotic,"
she said. “People have told me it’s,
not Lexington, and I said, ‘No, it’s
Paradise, and it’s meant to be
something different."’

Paradise is open Monday through
Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m..
Thursday through Saturday the hours
are 10, a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday hours
are 12 to 5 p.m.

g Washington and Lee students
‘kicked off the new school year's
dfirst weekend with fewer arrests and
‘alcohol-related injuries than last
year.
Q .l‘Lexington Police Chief B.W.

Lexington a “town out of control”

«pleased with the way things turned
out this weekend, and I hope that
‘things continue in this direction
vthroughout the year, ” said Beard.
Only 10 tickets were handed out
‘by Lexington police on Friday and
.Saturday nights, all were violations
for minors in possession of alcohol,
‘said Beard. Not all of the tickets
,were given to W&L students, he
said.
‘ During the same weekend in

including 29 for minors in

To add to the low arrest figures,

down considerably. The W&L

Live Drive, an organization on
‘campus dedicated to eradicating
1 drunk driving, will be available for

Washington and Lee ~students again‘

./ ‘this year.

Live Drive was established in the
Fall of 1988 by a group of students
‘who were concerned with providing
' safe rides to and from parties in
. order to avoid any accidents caused

‘ by intoxicated drivers.

' The 1989-90 Live Drive
leadership includes junior John
9. Fialcowitz; junior Amy Sapp,
director of publicity; juniors

4 Christopher Bray and Tim Clarke,
1 scheduling overseers; junior Amy
Aussiker, treasurer; and sophomore,
‘' Stephen Mathis, secretary.
This year the group is expecting
an even more effective operation of
Q Live Drive. The Live Drive vans
will not only ride upon the request
of different fraternities, but also will
1~ be in service every weekend with at
least one van on call. John
Fialcowitz urges anyone who needs
ca ride to a party who has been
drinking or who is riding with an
intoxicated person to call Room 204
1 of the University Center at 463-
8947 from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Fridays
and Saturdays.
g Live Drive also needs help in
order to meet the demands of the

Panhellenic Council.

The Council,
members from the
W&L sororities —— Chi Omega,
Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa
Kappa Gamma — decided this past
spring that the addition of a fourth
sorority was necessary to
accommodate the demand by W&L
women for sororities.

“Ideally we’d like members of
each sorority to number no more
than seventy-five. We want the

composed of

system to remain inclusive so every
woman who wants to be a part of
sororities at W&L has that chance.
It is necessary to add another group
in order to respond to demand,”
said Wendy Wilson, panhellenic

publicity, housing and extension
chairwoman.

The Sorority Advisory
Committee decided last year to

allow three sororities to colonize at
W&L after questionnaires showed
only 120 women indicating interest

in sororities. Over 250 women
pledged in January.

Money error haunts SAB

By Richard Peltz
Staff Reporter

The financial activities of Washington and Lee's

‘Student Activities Board will be carefully recorded and

monitored this year as the organization tries to recover
from a debt of more than $19,000.

According to David Grove, 1988-1989 SAB
chairman, "miscomrnunication" between former SAB
Treasurer Mike Carroll and last year's Fancy Dress
Chairwoman, Liz Smith, contributed to a debt of
$14,000 by early May, The Ring-tum Phi reported last
spring. This week, the SAB’s 1989-90 treasurer,
Kathleen Duwel, said the total debt was actually close
to $20,000.

And, while she said careful budgeting and an eye
on spending will allow the impact of last year's debt to
go virtually unnoticed by students, Duwel admitted that
the SAB’s new officers have inherited a series of
headaches along with the money troubles.

“We’re having a hard time coping with last year's
bills," she said. “They're still coming in.”

The Executive Committee, which supervises the
SAB and the use of student activities fees, paid last
year's debts and a number of bills received during the
summer with money from its reserve fund, Duwel said.
At the end of the 1988-89 school year, when the EC
closed the accounts of other organizations it sponsors,
all positive balances were put toward that fund. But EC
President Willard Dumas said that, despite that
concentration of resources, the SAB debt “has depleted
most of our student reserves." 1

Duwel said that a laissez-faire approach to SAB
spending last year caused the financial trouble. Charges
to the SAB’s business office account were
unnecessarily frequent and often were not recorded by
the treasurer, according to Duwel. .

“The attitude before this year was, ‘It’s‘not our
money,’ ” said Duwel. “My biggest goal is to stay on
top of where every single penny is."

Dumas said he has confidence in the new SAB
management. “The SAB is still going to have
autonomy in their activities," he said. “We've
appointed more people to act as watchdogs in the
SAB.” v

Christopher deMovellan, 1988-89 EC President, last
May told current SAB Chairman Charles Conklin to
dismiss SAB members who failed to perform their
duties, and Conklin said he intends to do just that.

“We're here to have a good time, but we’ve got a
duty and responsibility to the students,” \he said.
“Anyone who can't perform [his job] needs to step
aside for someone who can.” \

SAB officers have been fulﬁlling their duties for
some time already. In addition tomthe usual roster of

rock groups, SAB leaders said they hope to sponsor a
diversity of performers this year. Upcoming
entertainment in the General Headquarters will include
a piano player on Sept. 20 and a reggae band on Oct.
18, according to _ Michael Applebaum, SAB
entertainment director. He said an illusionist will
perform in the pavilion on Oct. 13, and the SAB will
repeat last year's bingo night at least once this fall, he
said. .

The SAB will present its 1989-90 budget to the EC
in October. Monday night the EC unanimously
approved to freeze SAB funds until further notice.

SAB reaches
to law school:

new job made

By Brian Root
Staff Reporter

Because the Student Activities Board has failed to
adequately advertise events to law students in the past,
the Executive Committee created new a position, that
of Publicity Director for the law school, at its meeting
Monday night.

Previously, said EC President Willard Dumas, there
has been only one SAB Publicity Chairman whose
responsibilities included advertising of student events
for both the undergraduate and law school campuses.

“It‘s been the history of the P SAB, never
intentionally, to tend to be centered on the
undergraduate campus,” Dumas said. “The law school
has ban often ignored by the SAB."

This year, Dumas said, the SAB failed to advertise
at the law school for last Friday‘: concert by the Truly
Dangerous Swamp Band at the Student Pavilion.

The EC will be accepting applications for ‘the
position in two weeks. This year, only law students
will be considered for the job, Dumas said.

“We felt the situation was so urgent that a law
school student was necessary for the job this year,"
Dumas said.

In subsequent years, undergraduates may be
considered for the position, Dumas said.

"With a publicity director for only the law school,
hopefully SAB functions will be better advertised."
said Dumas.

Beard says no noise isgood noise

By Brian Root
Staff Reporter

No fraternities received noise
violations this past weekend,
although several houses failed to
obtain noise permits, said Associate
Dean of Students Leroy C.
“Buddy” Atkins at the
Interfratemity Council meeting
Tuesday night.

Atkins attributed the lapses to
house officers’ not understanding
the new, more complicated rules for
obtaining noise permits.

This year, fraternities must
register their parties with the Dean
of Students office before they can
receive a noise permit from the
police department.

Atkins said from now on, houses
must be sure to register their parties
at the risk of receiving a rush
violation. This year, a house will
not be able to obtain a noise permit
for one week if it receives a noise

violation.
Atkins said each house should
expect to have band parties

scheduled for this Saturday night to
be shut down by 12:30 a.m. ‘

In addition, the Lexington Police
were called to Natural Bridge to
respond to an emergency call for
the shooting that occurred there
Saturday night (see other story).

However, Lexington Police Chief
Bruce Board said the incident did
not affect the department’s
enlbrcrsmerit of the noise regulations.

“All of our patrolmen were back
from Natural Bridge and back on
patrol by 11:30,” said Beard. “We
don't usually have to shut any
parties down before midnight.”

Beard credited W&L students
with being cooperative with the
police’s efforts Saturday night.

“I was very pleased with the
reception my officers got at each
house,” Beard said. “The students
were very. cooperative the whole
night.”

In other business, IFC President
Kevin Nash armounced each house

OPINION

The hammer falls
on the Phi Delts

The brothers of Phi Delta Theta have had a rough
summer. As we reported last week, Phi Delt’s W&L
chapter has been put on probation by the university for
leaving its fraternity house in what the chapter’s
adviser, Prof. Joseph Goldsten, and W&L’s dean of
fraternity affairs, Buddy Atkins, agreed was “unaccept-
able” condition.

Perhaps because so much has been made of W&L’s
Fraternity Renaissance, the noise of Dean Atkins’ ham-
mer falling on 5 Henry St. could be heard across the
campus. Among other things, according to a letter from
Atkins to Phi Delt President -Warren Holland, the
probation Atkins imposed limits the number of Phi Delt
pledges to 15, bans weeknight parties, limits the Phi
Delts to only four parties per month and only two per
month in the Phi Delt house, and demands that the Phi
Delt grade-point average rise at least one place per
term in the rankings of fraternities.

We understand Atkins’ frustration. The university has
put money and its reputation on the line by saying that
the fraternity system is worth saving. The W&L Board
of Trustees has stood up to those members of the
faculty who would be thrilled to see the fraternity
system go under, and the condition of the Phi Delt
house last May gave fraternity critics a spectacular
opportunity to scream, “We told you so!” Atkins had
no choice but to act swiftly and harshly.

neccessary, we agree with Holland that some aspects of
the probation are unfair. , ,

Specifically, we object to the insistence that Phi Delt
raise its house GPA in relation to those of other
houses. If Dean Atkins had said the Phi Delt GPA must
rise one-tenth, or even two-tenths, of a grade point, we
could see the reasoning and perhaps applaud him. But
instead, he wants the Phi Delts to jump over at least
one other house per term. No matter how much work
the Phi Delts do, even if they live in the library, they
cannot control the grades of other houses. And, under
these rules, it will be to the advantage of the Phi Delts
if other houses’ grades drop. The Hill should not be in
the business of promoting cut-throat grade wars.

And there is another problem with this probation: the
limit on pledges. Atkins told our reporter he doesn’t
know how the Phi Delts will handle that one, and we
don’t either. Should the Phi Delts give out only 15
bids? Should they give out 25 and hope only 15 are
accepted? Should they give out as many as they want
and then, a few days later, tell a collection of
freshmen, W&L men who were high school seniors
when the damage occured, “Sorry, just kidding?” If
the Phi Delts do rescind bids, who gets to stay and
who doesn’t? Atkins said the answers are up to the Phi
Delts, but it seems he has left them in a nearly
impossible situation.

Finally there is the question of guilt. We have no
reason to doubt reports from Atkins that the house was
“just generally trashed,” but we wonder if the right
people are being punished. Holland said most — if not
all — of the damage to the house was caused by some
of last year’s Phi Delt seniors. “I don’t think anybody
in this house now had anything to do with that,” he
said.

Even if Holland is mistaken, even if some of the Phi
Delts who have returned were involved in damaging
their chapter home, we believe Holland when he says
last year’s seniors were primarily responsible for the
rampage. We are left wondering if Atkins, perhaps
because the guilty are beyond his reach, has decided to,
go after those he can get his hands on instead.

We agree with Atkins that the Hill “must” make it
clear that this is not the thing to do, that this is
forbidden.” But we are not so sure that “there is an
attitude that exists in the house that this is the thing to
do.” Even though acts of vandalism in the past may
indicate the potential for acts of vandalism in‘ the
future, we think Atkins has, by so severly punishing the

Phi Delts of today and tomorrow, gone too far.

But the public-relations problems the Renaissance 
faces should not take a front seat to due process and .
fairness. While a punishment of some sort was certainly ‘

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

It used to be that everyone spoke
the same language and things were
simple and organized such that a Vi-
king crusader invading another coun-
try would have no problem ﬁnding
bathrooms and reading menus. And
then for some stupid reason (no one
knows why) the human species de-
cided to invent foreign languages.
Notice that I say the human species.
Animals of the same species always
speak the same language. If my dog
Brutus and I, for example. were trav-
elling in Switzerland and I met a
Swiss-Gerrnan named Frotag also ac-
companied by a dog, Frotag and I
could only stare blankly at each other
while Brutus and Frotag's dog would
be able to hold a colorful conversa-
tion using the barks and growls com-
mon to all dogs.

What I’m trying to say is that
countless difficulties could be

avoided if people who don't speak
the same language would only com-

  

municate using a universal system of
barks and growls. Of course, I'm on-
ly joking. This would never work;
we'd never be able to agree on a
universal bark-growl scheme. There-
fore. the only option remaining be-
sides actually learning a foreign lan-
guage is to avoid foreigners unless
they happen to be Fmglish-speaking

' foreigners.

Avoiding foreign language speak-
ing foreigners was easy until my sis-
ter decided to marry a French Mor-
occan. I soon found myself in North
Africa for a wedding ceremony
spending long weeks with _people
who could speak only French and/or
Arabic. Out of the thirty Americans,
French and Moroccan people normal-
ly eating dinner at Karim's (my
brother-in-law), house only two peo-
ple were fully bilingual. Karim and
his brother I-Iishem (no, I'm not
making these names up). Having
Karim or Hishem there to translate
made it possible for everyone to
communicate. Unfortunately, Karim
and Hishem also grew so weary of
continuous translating that they began
to play the kind of translator tricks

that start World Wars when they're
pulled off at the United Nations:

My family (in English): "Karim,
tell your Mother that dinner was
wonderful."

Karim (translating in French):
"Mom, the Americans say dinner
tasted like generic dog food and that
they would give up vital organs right
now for a Wendy's chicken
sandwich.”

Since I obviously couldn't rely on
Karim and his brother to do a good
job of translating I was forced to
devise an alternate technique. Since
my technique is quick, easy and does
not involve any type of thinking I
recommend it to anyone who might
be considering taking French classes
which are difficult and boring. The
ftrst‘step in my “Get by but know
nothmg" plan is based on the old
adage "say unto others as you would
have them sayunto you." Let's face
it, when people talk they spend a lot
of time repeating each other; there-
f0Y6. when you're talking to a
foreigner it's a good idea to simply
repeat anything they tell you. A con-

versation between me and one of my

French relatives will serve to exhibit
this point.

French relative (in French):
"Your head is shaped like a banana
bike seat."

Me (not understanding a word but
repeating in French): ”Your head is
shaped like a banana bike seat.”

The second and final step of my
“Get by but know nothing" plan is
the simple repetition of the word
“Bon" with any word which comes
to mind after it. Step two should be
used when someone tells you some- \
thing in French that is too long to
repeat. For example:

"Bon Jour" (good morning)

"Bon Voyage" (good trip)

"Bon Scott" (A musician from the
hard rock band AC-DC who
overdosed on some industrial strength
drug like Lemon Scented Tide.)

Remember, my two—step commu-
nicating-in-foreign languages
technique should only be used as a
last resort. If it is not already too
late, I would recommend that readers
with sisters force them to become
nuns or introduce them to Midwest-
emers named “Bob."

object to story
on probation

We are writing this letter in response to the
story headlined “Phi Delt hit with probation,”
which appeared on the first page of last week's
edition of The Ring-tum Phi. While we do not
deny that extensive damage was done to our
chapter house at the end of the 1988-89 school
year, we feel that we were unjustly treated
when the conditions of our probation were
made public last week by Associate Dean of
Students Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins.

We accept full responsibility for the wanton
destruction perpetrated by a few of our now-
graduated members last spring, and obviously
we also accept conditions of our probationary
status, but we feel that Dean Atkins had
neither the duty nor the right to disclose the
conditions of our probation to the public. It
seems that he was only kicking us while we
were down when he passed on a copy of his
letter outlining our probation and addressed
only to Warren Holland, president of Phi Delta
Theta, to a news-hungry Ring-turn Phi reporter.

Furthermore, Dean Atkins’ comment that
“Clearly there is an attitude that exists on the
house that this (breaking windows, etc.) is the
thing" to do," was both inaccurate and
urmecessary. Before the year-end damage to
the house, which was perpetrated by a few
rowdy members who graduated in '89, we had
cut our damage expenses in half over the
previous year, and we fell they were
comparable to any other house our size at
W&L. The story depicted Phi Delt as a pack
of wild party boys hell-bent on breaking mics
and destroying property, which just isn't the
case. It is a shame that the actions of a few
can lead to the painting of such a grim,
inaccurate picture. It _

It seems that Dean Atkins and/or The Ring-
tum Phi have failed to mention the numerous
accomplishments and positive aspects of our
fraternity, especially over the past three years.
Phi Delt has won the overall intramural trophy
two of the past three years, and we have
boasted leaders on various varsity athlete teams
as well. During this period, Phi Delts have
served as captains of the football and cross
country teams, and our members have stood
out on the baseball, basketball and tennis teams
as well. Two Phi Delts earned All-American
honors in tennis for the 1988 season when
W&L won the NCAA Division III national
championship. Several members have received
numerous awards and recognition in football as
well.

Phi Delt is well-represented outside of
W&L;s athletic programs, too. We have
consistently had a member serve on the
Executive Committee, and for the fourth time
in four years a Phi-Delt will co-chair the
school-wide Muscular Dystrophy Association

  

Superdance. "Phi Delts have also been very
active in Kathekon and t SAB, and are
consistently one of the largest group donors at
the carnpus-wide blood drive. A number of
our members serve as volunteer coaches for
the Rockbridge Area Recreation Organization,
and others are active in the big brother/little
brother program. One needn’t look hard to see
the strong, positive side of Phi Delt.

The events that occurred at the close of last
year were indeed unfortunate for Phi Delt, but
we are confident that we will emerge from our
probationary period stronger and more uniﬁed
than ever. In 1987, our chapter celebrated its
100th year of existence on the W&L campus,
and we intend to preserve our place here for at
least another 100 years, as we are equal to the
challenges set forth in Atkins’ edict.

Sincerely,
The Brothers of Phi Delta Theta,
Virginia Zeta Chapter

Student calls
Calyx photo
patently racist

Flipping through the senior pictures in my
Calyx, I came across a very disturbing picture
on page 131. It was a picture of Professor
Futch, surrounded by seniors. In front of them
was a racist icon: the so-called “porch
monkey.” (I am told that it is also known by
even worse names.) I did not know any of
the people in the picture. However, after
looking at the fraternity pictures, I discovered
that the majority of the seniors in the picture
were KAs and SAEs, with a few Phi Delts
thrown in.

I am not surprised that most of the seniors
in the picture were from those fraternities — I
wonder why. One would expect something
like this from a KA or an SAE; it seems that
baing racist is part of their tradition (which is
by no means to say that all of their
membership is racist.)

However, one would expect more from a
professor. But then again, considering the
extreme respect Prof. Futch has for women, it
isn't surprising that he has equally little
sensitivity for the feelings of other
“undesirables" responsible for all of society's
ills.

This past (academic) year there was a
conference held to discuss the alleged racial
insensitivity (to say the least) of various

members of KA, among others. Their
representatives tried to discount those
accusations. I wonder how the “good ole

boys” of the aforementioned fraternities intend
to explain away their latest episode of
stupidity.

So, then. let me ask: do you. (the members
of KA, SAE and Phi Delta Theta) condemn

 

such a patently racist act; or do you condone
it? Come on, this is your big chance to prove ‘
that all of you are not a bunch of rednecks.

This Yankee liberal hopes to be hearin’
from y'all in the next Phi.

Sincerely,
Gary Hugh Green, H, '91

P.S. I was going to write a nasty letter, but I
thought it below me.

Editor's Note: According to Prof. Futch, the
photograph was taken at a student's home, and
he was not responsible for its staging.

Dan McDowell
remembered:
‘I miss you’

I read the article on Dan McDowell’s death
in last week's Ring-tum Phi while swallowing
back tears. I must say that despite doubts, I
agree that the decision to run a front-page
article was for the best. Unfortunately, when
such a tragedy strikes our campus, it merits, if
not demands, such coverage. I do empathize
with the editors and their decision.

However, though the news was not new to
me, I nonetheless found myself searching for
something more. I wanted, as was written in
the editorial section, to read about “the name
behind the face." I wanted to read about the
Daniel that I knew. I wanted others to hear
what a wonderful person he was, to shed light
on his life at W&L, if nothing else.

Daniel lived to ski, and Europe was his
ultimate fantasy. He danced with the case of
Fred Astaire and thought that plaid and paisley
maid an interesting match. He loved good
wine, hated bad wine, and knew the difference.
He thought everyone should know history, see
foreign films, and leam a foreign language —
French and German were his favorites. Six was
the perfect number of children, Fisher Price
toys being a must. Halloween was great, but
black jelly beans should stay in the store. The
Ski Club, Outing Club, Film Society, Voting
Regulations Board and Glee Club all knew of
Dan's talents; the peer counselors were going
to learn. The Foreign Service was his long-‘
term goal. Dan loved life, loved his friends
and, most importantly, loved his family. He
believed in living in the present, not casting a
shadow back to the past or an extended hand
toward the future. Each moment he lived was
his own.

Though words can't relieve shock and can't_
ease pain, they can tell you about the fun-lov-
ing, sensitive, talented Daniel whose last years
were spent at W&L. I miss you Dan; we all
miss you. Thanks for what you gave us.

faculty- lecture series on Tuesday
, with “The History of Nuclear Fu-
tures” by Dr. Robert Strong, the
new Chairman of the Washington
, and Lee politics department.
According to Strong, the lecture

ar weapons provide both safety and
terror by analyzing various philoso-
4 phies of arms control and deploy-
merit.
“Since the discovery of nuclear
a fusion, scientists, statesmen and citi-
zens have speculated on how civili-

,. weapons of mass destruction,”
lStrong explained, adding that, “In

moment in performance to the com-
fort of their own homes.”

Prior to becoming the university’s
chief photographer, Hinely was in-
structor at Flagler College. He
served as a staff photographer for the
Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston,
S.C. from 1977-86, and worked as a

er for WJCT-FM, the NPR affiliate
in Jacksonville, Fla., from 1978-80.
His works have been exhibited in
galleries in a number of cities in the

His works have appeared on re-
cord album jackets and liner notes
for various companies in the US,
Germany and Japan, and in numerous
jazz magazines.

Mason, a Lexington native, is
photo editor for the Fairbanks (Alas-
ka) Daily News-Miner and a photog-
rapher for Black Star publications in
New York. He has worked for Fair-
banks paper since’ 1984, as staff and
chief photographer, prior to becoming
photo editor. He also worked as as-
sociate university photographer for
Washington and Lee and as a string-
er for the Roanoke Times and World-
News and the Lexington News-
Gazette.

Mason has also done a variety of
freelance photojournalism for newspa-
pers and magazines, product photog-
raphy for catalogs, and public rela-
tions photography. His personal
work includes documentary portrai-
ture, street photography and large
format landscape work.

Mason holds a master's degree in
documentary photography from Illi-
nois State University. His awards
include the Oskar Bamack Award, a
Nature Series at World Press Photo
award and NPPA National awards.

Soviets join student body

By Scott Sanders

_ Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee is again
host to three exchange students from
the Soviet Union.

Maxim Gan and Inna
Vodovozova, both from Moscow,
and Dmitry Dobograev, from the
Byelorussian capital of Minsk,
arrived in the U.S. about a month
ago after months and stacks of
paperwork and examinations, and
after, quite literally, only a few days
notice of their acceptance by the
exchange program.

Maxim, Inna, and Dmitry are
among 58 Russian students studying
in American colleges and
universities through the American
Collegiate Consortium for East-West
Cultural and Academic Exchange.
This consortium is based at
Middlemury College, where the
students went through a 10 day
orientation period before travelling

to the campus that had been
selected for them.
In Lexington, the three new

students were greeted. assisted and

housed by Ancce McCloud, dean for
minority students and international
affairs. In the short time that they
have been here, Maxim, Inna and
Dmitry have slowly been adjusting
to their new environment and
getting into the swing of W&L life,
doing such things as playing
raquetball for the first time, hanging
out at the International House, and
going to fraternity parties. All three
said they appreciate the chance to
choose their own classes. In most of

the Russian universities, each
student decides upon his
specialization upon entering the

university and then follows a set
curriculum for the specific
specialization, they said. Changing
specializations normally involves
starting a new curriculum with little
chance of class transferring.

This year, half of their courses
must be in their specialization, but
this leaves the opportunity to study
many subjects that might otherwise
be unavailable.

Maxim said he is following in
his father’s footsteps by specializing

in journalism at Moscow State
University. When Maxim was a
child, his father was stationed in
Washington, D.C., working for the
Tass News Agency, so he has
already had a great deal of exposure
to the U.S. and is happy to be back
on his own for a year. Courses in
U.S. politics will be among those
accompanying his journalism
classes, and he said he hopes to use
his reporting skills in socializing
here at W&L before looking into
other student activities.

Inna, abroad for the first time, is
studying to be a doctor at the
Second Moscow State Medical
University and will also study
English and music.

Dmitry is specializing in
international law at Byelorussian
State University with the hopes of
being a politician, a position he
realizes is becoming increasingly
important in today's Soviet Union.
Here at W&L, he ‘is studying
American government and social
psychology.

Copies can be ‘freed’ home

By Wendy Wolford
Staff Reporter

Searching for change for photo
copying machines became a thing of
the past at Washington and Lee
University this week with the intro-
duction of the new copier card sys-
tem.

“It's a convenience to students
as well as a convenience to us, ”
said University Librarian Barbara
Brown. Instead of inserting change
into the machine or signing out a
key, card holders can make copies
with no loss of time or hassle, she
said.

Although copier cards have been
used in the W&L law library for
the past two years, Brown said the
university opted for the system the
summer when the library was
searching for new copiers.

Sororities
set to rush

By Cecily Tynan
Staff Reporter

Upperclassi women who did
not take part in or did not re-
ceive -bids during Washington
and Lee's sorority rush this past
January will have the opportuni-
ty to participate in informal rush
next week, said Panhellenic
President Jane Lee Joyce.

“It’s basically giving a sen-
ior woman who didn’t rush last
January, for one reason or anoth-
er, a chance for pledgeship to be
completed during the first semes-
ter of her senior year. This will
give her theopportunity to be an
active member and experience
what Greek life has to offer
women at Washington and Lee,”
said Joyce.

Eligible students, including
sophomores and juniors, are en-
couraged to sign up. Forms may
be picked up in the Dean of
Students‘ office on Friday and
are due by noon Monday.

“I do hope that all unaffiliat-
ed women will go through
rush,” said Joyce.

Women who received bids
last January but did not accept
them may not go through rush
until January, Joyce said.

In addition to. the convenience of
the “credit card ” system, Brown
said the new machines are also bet-
ter suited to library use. They hold
more paper than the former ones
and are designed to protect book
spines, she said.

According to John Cuny, assis-
tant treasurer and controller at
W&L, the copier card is one step
further to a “cashless society” at
the university. Along with other uni-
versity employees and students,
Cuny has been studying the possi-
bility of a campus-wide credit sys-
tem. .

He said that with such a system,
students could use the same card to
purchase meals, buy books, open
doors and even operate laundry ma-

chines. After examining the copier,

card system and programs at other
schools, Cuny's committee will

make a recommendation to the uni-

versity in March.

For the moment, Cuny said the
copier card is “just one piece of the
puzzle." A convenience to the stu-

V

dents and a time saver for book- ,

keepers, he added that the copier
card will make the university rim
more efficiently.

Although most of the copy ma-
chines on campus still use change,
copiers in the Commerce School,
the University Printing Center and
the law library accept the copier
card also.

The card, which can be pur-
chased in the Business Office f r
$5, already carries $4.50 in credit,
‘said Brown. There is a $.50 charge
for use of the card. When the ma-
chines have deducted the intial
amount of credit, added values can
be purchased as needed.

Slow start costs
Generals at E&H

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

When the Washington and Lee
football team opens its season on
the road, it usually means bad news.
The Generals have not won a road
opener since 1969. In recent years,
the Generals had been blown out on
opening day, most recently a 41-12
loss last year to Emory and Henry.

This year, it was a different
story as the Generals took the ﬁeld
last Saturday against the Wasps of
E&H in Emory, Va. Though the

Generals came up on the short end :

ofia 36-25 win, head coach Gary
Fallon was pleased with his team's
performance.

“We saw that we were able to
move the ball and put points on the
board against a very good defensive
team. Now we've got to keep away
from any turnovers. We fumbled the
ball a couple of times in crucial
ﬁeld position."

The Generals got off to a slow
start, and three turnovers in the first
half contributed to 16 Emory and
Henry points to put the Generals in
a hole. On the Generals first
possession, senior quarterback
Phillip Sampson's option pitch to
senior fullback Russell Crosby was
mishandled, and the Wasps
recovered 6n the W&L 42.

The Wasps then took to the
ground behind an offensive line that
outweighed the Generals’ defensive
line by an average of close to 30
pounds. Running behind the right
side, anchored by John Willson (215
pounds) and B.I. Salyers (250),
tailback Scotty Verran ran six times
for 42 yards, getting the touchdown
on a one—yard run with 9:35 left in
the quarter.

After not being able to get a
ﬁrst down on the next series, the

enerals were forced to punt. Junior
Mason Pope's third career punt was
blocked by Da.nny Asher and
recovered on the W&L eight. The
Generals defense buckled, and the
Wasps were forced to settle for a
21 yard ﬁeld goal by Monty Guy.

After sophomore Jeff Kreis
returned the kickoff out to the W&L
27 yard line, the offense went to
work. Sampson and Co. abandoned
the running game for a ball—control

     

passing attack, and the Generals
went on a 12-play, 73-yard drive.
On the drive, Sampson completed
ﬁve passes, including a 33-yard
broken-play pass to senior tight—end
Bob Martin, with gave the Generals
first and goal on the Wasps’ two
yard line. Three plays later, Pope
went in from the one, and junior
Carter Quayle’s point-after made it
10-7.

Emory & Henry took the kick-
off and marched 53 yards for a
touchdown. Verran again was king
bee, scoring on a ﬁve-yard run with
11:55 left in the first half to put the
Wasps up 17-7.

After another W&L fumble,
E&H quarterback Pat (Walker found
freshman wide-out Cary Perkins
open for a 22-yard touchdown pass.
Guy’s kick was blocked, so the
Wasps led 23-7. Perkins, who had
six catches for 132 years and one
touchdown, is partially deaf.
“Perkins is a ﬁne young player and
we are going to see a lot from him

in the next three years,’ ’ said
Fallon.
The Generals were not

discouraged by the turnovers though,
and Sampson drove the Generals 48
yards, again with short passes, for a
33-yard ﬁeld goal by Quayle. Junior
flanker Craig Irons ‘caught ﬁve
passes on the drive for 39 yards.
Quayle’s kick made the score 23-10
at the half.

After Walker scored a touchdown
on the opening drive of the second
half to make it 29-10 for the
Wasps, the Generals started to cut
into the lead.

After E&H’s Guy missed a ﬁeld
goal, the Generals climbed aboard
Air-Sampson. The senior completed
all eight of his passes on an 80
yard drive, including a six-yard pass
to Irons in the comer of the end
zone for W&L’s second touchdown
of the day.

After the teams traded punts,
Buchanan capped an 83-yard drive
for the Wasps with a four-yard
touchdown run. Along the way,
Walker completed two long passes
to Perkins to keep the drive alive.
Guy’s PAT made the score 36-17,
E&H.

Needing three scores to tie, the

and Lee water polo team opened the
1989 season.

W&L spent the weekend
crushing Lynchburg and Harnpden-
Sydney twice apiece Saturday in the
W&L Invitational.

The Generals, who lost about 75
percent of their goal scoring from
last year due to graduation, didn’t
seem to miss the old players. The
Generals were as dominant as ever,
trotting out a whole new stable of
talented players.

How dominant were they? Well,

,W&L outscored the opposition by

an average of more than 7-2 in the
first quarter, giving head coach Page
Remillard the luxury of benching
his starters in the last game.

Last ‘year's team was built on
muscle and brute strength, but these
Generals play a different type of

game, using their great team speed,
ﬁne goaltending by co-captain David
Olson, and resourcefulness to swim
their way to victory. Junior Tomas
Perez and freshman Scott Strader
combined for over 30 goals, keying
‘the offense in the four game set.

Remillard felt the Generals
beneﬁted from the chance to
perform against other schools, even
though his team was demonstratively
superior. “The tournament put the
season off to a good start. It
allowed us to experiment and
change lineups so I could get some
time for the younger players. Our
schedule complements our need to
take things one step at a time.”

However, both the coach and the
players realize that the season
begins in earnest this weekend as
the team travels to Boston for the
Northeast Varsity Invitational held at
MIT.

Don’t make the mistake of
assuming that W&L will be

Brown kicks W&L
past Denison, 5-3

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

The men's soccer team, led by
senior Patrick Brown's three goals,
defeated Denison 5-3 Saturday at
Liberty Hall Field in their 1989
season opener.

It is the second straight year
that the Generals have beaten the
Big Red to open the season. Last
season, W&L won the opening-day
meeting in Granville, Ohio, 2-1 in
overtime.

Gone from last year's squad are
ﬁve senior starters, including co-
captains Mike Veliuona and All-Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
fullback Steve “Sid" Udicious and
leading scorer Johnny Sarber. Also
missing from the Generals’
backﬁeld is veteran Jeff Caggiano,
who is taking the season off to
concentrate on applying to medical
school.

As a result, W&L started the
game with a defensive backﬁeld
loaded with inexperience, and it
showed early on. Sophomore Jeff
Zieger got his first start at fullback,
while freshman Greg Williams
started at sweeper, and classmates
Chase Davis and Matt Hepler split
duty at stopper, and Reid Murphy,
another freshman, saw considerable
time at the other back.

The Generals got on the
scoreboard first when Patrick Brown
(the W&L career assist leader with
17) sent the ball into the upper right
comer of the net from the top of
the penalty box with just under nine
minutes gone in the first half.

The early lead was short lived,
though, as the new-look W&L
defense failed to communicate and

senior goalkeeper Jack Pringle's
defensive commands were not
executed. Two minutes after
Brown's ﬁrst goal, Denison’s

leading scorer, Jaan Douma, tied the
score after W&L’s backfield failed
to clear the ball.

The backﬁeld, anchored by
Pringle (who allowed just .667 goals
per game last year) and Williams,
regrouped and played thirteen
minutes of solid defense until they
momentarily lost their intensity and
allowed Denison’s Chris Epley to

rebound an indirect kick and arch a’
shot over Pringle's head for the Big
Red's second goal and a 2-1 lead.

With 4:09 left in the first half,
W&L knotted the score at 2-2.
After Williams cleared the ball to
Rick Silva, the senior forward
dribbled down the middle of the
ﬁeld between two Denison defenders
and dished the ball off to his left to
a wide open Brown, who one-timed
the ball into the lower right comer
of the goal.

The Generals erupted for two
quick goals to start the second half.
At the 38:24 mark, Silva dribbled
around the charging Denison goalie
and rolled the ball into the empty
net. Just over one minute later,
senior Scott Levitt passed the ball
to the right side to sophomore
David Hooker, who sent it high into
the opposite side of the net for what
proved to be the garne-winner.

With 25:45 remaining in the
contest, W&L’s lead was cut to one
after Denison’s Scott Demo caught
the Generals’ defense napping and
broke away with the ball on the
right side. Pringle came off the
goal line too far and he helplessly
watched Demo's shot roll into an
empty net.

W&L added an insurance goal
seven minutes later when Hooker
blindly headed the ball backwards
from the right comer to a somewhat
surprised Brown, who put it high
into the net from a low angle to
earn his first career hat trick.

With just over seven minutes left
to play, sophomore Lee Corbin
replaced Pringle (10 saves) in goal
and collected four saves of his own.

Head coach Rolf Piranian spoke
of the game in terms of survival.
“Big chunks of our game plan fell
apart and we played just well
enough to win,” he said, referring
to shaky defense, which at times did
not “click real well."

This weekend the Generals head
to Baltimore where they will take
on Johns Hopkins and Camegie—
Mellon. The two games will answer
some questions about the Generals’
defense. “We must make massive
improvements on defense to be in
the games this weekend,” Piranian
said.

 

 

  

John Morris volleyed his way to both the

Winning it all a ball
for W&L’s Morris

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

I’ll admit, one of the ﬁrst problems that newspaper people, espe-
cially those of us who handle the sports department, run into is
deadlines. Sometimes, deadlines don’t allow us to publish everything
that deserves publication. As assistant sports editor last year, I ran into
that problem.

At the time of the press run for the last issue of The Ring-tum Phi
last year, the men’s tennis team had just ﬁnished the team portion of
the NCAA Division III tournament, ﬁnishing ﬁfth in the nation. That,
however, was not the end of the season for the top four players:
senior John Morris, Bobby Matthews, Robert Haley and junior Bill
Meadows. Matthews and Haley have since graduated, but their accom-
plishinents in the individual portion of the tournament deserve recogni-
l.l()I‘l.

Haley and Meadows, the No. 2 doubles team for the Generals last
year, made it to the round of 16 in the doubles tournament to qualify
for Honorable Mention All-America status.

Morris and Matthews went into the tournament seeded third. The
duo lived up to their billing, and then some. The pair lost once on the
week in the team portion of the tournament, and avenged that loss on
their way to the NCAA Division IH doubles title, winning all their
matches in straight sets, including a 6-2, 6-3 win in the ﬁnals.

Morris, though, wasn’t ﬁnished on the week. The second seed in
the singles draw went into the toumament on an impressive winning
streak. The streak reached 19 matches in a row when Morris blasted
his way into the finals against Larry Gewer. Morris won the ﬁrst set,
but then proceeded to drop his ﬁrst set in the tournament to even the
match. Not discouraged, Morris got an early break in the deciding set
and held on for a 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 win and a rare NCAA double.

It was the first time that one player had swept the Division III
titles since 1982.

After claiming the singles and doubles titles, Morris and Matthews
went on the Athens, Ga. to compete in the NCAA Division I tourna-
ment. In the doubles, the pair fell in the first round to a team from
West Virginia who made it to the quarterﬁnals in two tight sets, 7-5,
6-4. The pair finished the season with a 28-5 overall record.

Morris drew a tough opponent in the singles draw, Southern
Califomia’s Eric Amend. Amend was a member of the 1988 U.S.
Olympic tennis team and won the NCAA D-I doubles title. Morris
gave Amend more than he wanted to handle, but the USC star pre-
vailed in three tough sets, to end Morris’ dream season at 26-9. It was
the first time a Division III player had won a set in the Division I
tournament.

“Last year, right after I did it, I thought it would be great if I was
graduating then,” said Morris. “But the more I think about it now,
the iriore I realize how much I’d like to do it again this year. I know
it puts more pressure on me, but I’d really like to do it again this
year.

This fall, Rolex, which sponsors the NCAA tennis circuits, named
Morris to a 23-person All-America team for the 1988 season. The
team consists of the top men and women players in the nation. The
only Division III player on the team, Morris was ﬂown up last week
to New York for a banquet honoring the team members.

Congratulations to W&L’s All-American tennis contingency, John

‘” Morris, NCAA Division III singles and doubles champion, Bobby

Matthews, NCAA Division III doubles champion, and Robert Haley
and Bill Meadows, NCAA Divsion HI Honorable Mention All-America
doubles.

As the new sports editor, it is my duty to give coverage to each
team that is as fair and as equal as possible. It is not always possible
for each team to get a full story each week. There will be times when
certain sports’ weekly results will be placed in the Sports Notebook. I
will try to be fair in the placement of teams in the Notebook. I will
try to make sure that if a team is in the Notebook one week, it will
not be the next. ‘

1 am going to try to continue the montly feature of Atli1ete-of-the-
Month. Coaches, if you feel anyone has had an outstanding month and
deserves recognition, feel free to let me know. If anyone has any
problems with the way a particular sport is being handled, please feel
free to get in touch with me at the Phi office, 463-8581. I will try to
get in touch with all the coaches and hopefully will be able to answer
any questions you have about sports in the Phi.

The Washington and Lee
women’s soccer opened their season

last year’s success.

Head coach Jan Hathom was
excited and optimistic going into the
fall women's soccer season, and
although the Generals struggled last
week, they showed signs of playing
like they did late last season.

The Generals opened their
season Thursday against Old
Dominion Athletic Conference foe
Randolph-Macon Woman's College
in Lynchburg.

W&L trailed throughout most of
the game, but came on strong in the
final ten rriinutes to clinch a season-
opening win.

Randolph-Macon scored first, 28
minutes into the game off a fast
break. W&L co-captain Sarah Allen
then tied the game with a penalty
kick just before halftime.

R-MWC pulled ahead 2-1 30
minutes into the second half, but
their second lead, like their first,
was short lived. The
offense came alive with a ﬂurry,
scoring three times in the final ten
minutes, including twice in the last
50 seconds of play to win the game.

Senior co—captain Catherine
Baillio tallied twice to put the
Generals in front, and freshman
Wendy Miles scored the ﬁnal goal
of the game with just twenty
seconds left.

On Saturday, the Generals
played their first home game of the
season against the Lady Blue
Marlins of Virginia Wesleyan. The
Marlins, a new edition to the
ODAC, scored just 30 seconds into
the game. W&L remained
undaunted, playing an aggressive
defensive game.

Va. Wesleyan led 1-0 at the
half. For W&L, junior goalie Sherri
Brown had eight saves.

The Marlins repeated their ﬁrst
half performance by scoring early in
the second half, after about forty
seconds of play had elapsed. The
Generals continued to play well, and

Generals proceeded to drive 76
yards for one of the scores, a 15-
yard pass from Sampson to Kreis.
Sampson then found Crosby open
for the two-point conversion, but
that would be the last score of the
day, as the Wasps turned back the

Generals 36-25.
“Our team came out with a lot
of conﬁdence about the rest of the

, season," said Sampson. “What we

did on offense felt good. But the
fact that we lost puts a damper on
that feeling. We can't win games
just because we played well against
Emory and Henry."

made their first and only dent in the
scoreboard when sophomore Ann
Shaughnessy put the ball in the goal
for the Generals off an assist_from
Allen, who restarted play with a
direct kick. The Generals were
unable to put the ball in the net
again, and were saddled with a 2-1
loss.

Sophomore Katie Seeman
replaced Brown in the goal for the
Generals in the second half, and
recorded ﬁve saves.

Despite the loss, Hathom was
pleased wih the way her
played. “We played a good game,
and although we didn't win, there

team '

were some positive things that came
out of the game. Our players are
learning how to read what is going
on in the game, which is something
that takes time.”

“This game was indicative of
the kind of games we’ll have the
rest of the season. We'll have to
play aggressively and at the level
we are playing now. I feel that right
now, we are playing at a level
above what we did last year.”

Hathom was excited about the
play of goalies Brown and Seeman.
“We got a great game from both of
our goalies, and I was also pleased
with our midﬁeld line [sophomore

at
Morgan Warner and junior’ Page
Kilian], which was my big conceml
coming into the season.” ,
W&L traveled to Liberty
University on Tuesday, where theyl
were defeated 4-0. Despite the loss, j
the Generals remained optimistic.
“We were a little sluggish,” said i
senior Beth Stutzinanri. “We played
pretty well, but we know we can do
better.” ' l-

By R.J. Thomas

Q Auditions for “The Body
Shop,” a new musical comedy by
W&L professor Tom Ziegler, will
be held this Friday at 7 p.m. and
Saturday and Sunday at 3 p.m. in
the University Theater.

The play is about a group of
people forced into a weight loss
,.program by the company they work
for. The company is called Work-
slng Girl Cosmetics and because it is

cosmetics company they believe it
‘would look better for their employ-
ees to ’look good. It's about various
attitudes about image instead of
"what is inside the characters, Ziegler
paid. It is a musical comedy devoted
to anyone who has ever tried to
’lose weight.
 It is a musical in an aerobics
setting. “Musicals are harder to
‘write, but they’re more fun,” said

'egler, “Aerobics involve music so
it seemed natural for a musical.”
Music for the play was composed
by Marvin Salzberg, a former teach-

Er at the City College of New York. .

Choreography will be done by Gin-
er McNeese, a local dance instruc-
or.

4‘ Ziegler also has a play, titled
“Home 'Games," opening off-
Broadway in New York in October.

, There are ﬁve roles open in the
play and four can probably be ﬁlled

by students, Ziegler said. Three of
the roles, two women and one man,
are sightly overweight characters.

“It's a great chance for people who
an sing and dance but are a little
verweight,” said Zeigler. Being
verweight though isn’t necessary to
getting a part hr the play. One of

ihe roles is a sexy aerobics instruc-
tor and one is a tough, well-built,
male union leader. The toughest

part to cast, according to 1D. Marti-

By Robert Wilson

Packages, room key, schedule,
matriculation, orientation...these
words all seem so familiar to
freshmen at the beginning of every
fall term. The experience is unique
in itself and involves emotions that
must be felt to be frilly understood.
At this point all of us at W&L have
endured ~the task of moving in.
Some look back on it with
comforting interest, remembering
that distant age of innocence. Some

recall its being a tense, difficult’

period when the world seemed so
foreign. Some remain indifferent
and don’t really remember what it
was like. However, to 424 young
men and women, this initiation into
the college world is a substantial
experience.

It seems that moving in occurs
in a series of phases that touch
different areas of life. The first
thing encountered is the physical
environment. Freshmen arrive on
campus seeing a warm, inviting
place steeped in white columns, red-
brick buildings, green commons and
smiling faces. You register, find
your room and begin setting up.
You organize your dorm room to
suit YOUR personality. You put up
posters you like, set your books on
the dresser, fill drawers with your
clothes, and play your music in the
room. You attempt, as much as
possible, to make your room your
home. Your physical environment
also includes the people around you
on your hall. It can be frustrating
when Billy “Slash and Burn”
Johnson is next door banging his
head on the wall to the beat of the
latest Anthrax album when you are
more accustomed to relaxing to Cat
Stevens. For those who have
singles, the first thought when
arriving is’ that the housing office
surely made a mistake and assigned
you to live in the janitor‘s broom
closet.

Another aspect of life the
freshman must deal with is the
social factor. There are many
different kinds of people here at
W&L. The freshman _must

Freshman year:

on your own
for the first time

surmount the sometimes
overwhelming job of meeting new

‘people and making new friends.‘
,This

is particularly difficult for
freshman guys going through Rush.
There are hundreds of fraternity
brothers out there welcoming you
with a smile and a handshake.
Knowing which frat is the right one
for you is next to impossible at
first. The whole process can be so
superficial and
Unfortunately, this is the only way
it can be done with any level of
efficiency. Rush is a good thing
for freshman guys to experience as
it will create those bonds of
friendship that will last at least
through college and possibly through
an entire lifetime.

To seem smooth and “into it” is
a social status goal most freshmen

By Jennifer Barrows

Having survived my first week
as a freshman at Washington and
Lee, I am now quite prepared to
really settle into honest-to-goodness
college life and start enjoying
myself as much as possible. Gone
are the identifying narnetags that
branded us a freshmen. Instead I
find myself equipped only with my
weatherbeaten L.L. Bean backpack,
a dog—eared (and much—revised)
copy of my schedule, and $200
worth of books that Ihave not quite
figured out what to do with yet.

I finally for fed up with the
state of my dorm room and,
employing a nonchalant method of
cleaning, stashed everything either
under the bed or in one of the
spacious walk-in closets. Where

'once the room appeared to be a

national disaster site, it now looks
more like the humble home of two
freshman girls who happen to own
an overabundance of stuff.

Since Rush officially kicked off
on Saturday, freshman bonding does
not play as active a role as it did

during the days of orientation.
However, hobnobbing with the
upperclassmen seems to be a

pastime in which everyone engages
with energy. No longer do I feel
like a happy kid at summer camp as
I did at orientation meeting after
orientation meeting, alumni
barbecues, and friendly get-to-know-
your-fellow-freshmen soirees. I can
now proudly call myself an
undergraduate student of Washington
and Lee University.

As a freshman, Ihave become

clueless freshmen who inundate me
with questions about how to do
their laundry. I do not complain,
though. Knowing helpful laundry

The second phenomena that I
have noticed among freshmen
students is their growing dependence
on Dominos pizza. Not a day (or
night) goes by without a smiling

Stones hit the road
with Steel Wheels

 

By Allen Herrick
Stall’ Reporter

For the first time since 1981,
Rolling Stones fans have legitimate
reason to be excited. Obviously,
the huge North American tour that
the Stones recently embarked upon
is enough to thrill any Stones fol-
lower, but more importantly (at least
for those people who couldn't get

. tickets for the show), Steel Wheels

the new release from the band, sig-
nals the retum of the classic Stones

5 sound - a sound that has been sore-
; ly missed since 1981's Tatoo You
; album.

Steel Wheels recalls the mid—sev-

. enties style of rhythm and bluesy
 rock that the Stones are known for,
” The new album returns the group to

its old form, not the mid-eighties
drivel that disappointed fans and
band members, and eventually led to

A the group's brief break-up.

The ﬁrst single released from the
new album, “Mixed Emotion” al-
most suspiciously resembles
“Shouldn't Take It So Hard," the
lead single off of Richard's “Talk
Is Cheap” solo effort. However,
one intangible factor shapes the new

song into a vintage Stones hit: Mick
Jagger’s lyrics, voice, and inﬂuence.
The Jagger/Richards songwriting
history adds a new chapter, clearly
exempliﬁed by “Mixed Emotions.”

' The album contains vintage
Rolling Stones rock with songs like
“Sad Sad Sad" and “Hold On to
Your Hat," but the best tracks are
the mellower, richer songs like the
funky “Terrifying” and the ballad
“Slipping Away.”

Jagger and Richards still write
songs the same way, the difference
in Steel Wheels is that the instru-
mental sound is closer to the recent
Undercover album than to anything
else. Jagger's voice, though,
threatens as well as ever, retaining
its unique, classic sound.

Keith Richards sings lead vocals
on two songs, which is one song
too many. “Slipping Away,” the
last track on the disc, is a beautiful
song that perfectly completes the
album. Richard's scratchy,
wavering voice does not strain or
break the song. He is low key and
decently pitched on this ballad.

“Can’t Be Seen,” on the other
hand, chops its way through four
minutes of Richards’ hacking and

album is dragged down by this tune
and by “Hearts for Sale,” a filler
song whose only redeeming quality

The otherwise terriﬁc

is a scorching Ron Wood riff.
Even Wood cannot save this song,
however, and its blandness is further
aggravated by the occasional
glimmering effort by Wood.

Visit to Uncle Buck worth

 

By Todd Peppers
_Entertalnment Columnist

What family does not have that
one stereotypical black sheep? Don't
you have a relative embedded in your
family tree that you manage to avoid
telling your friends about? Maybe it
is your aunt who drinks too much,
buys her jewelry at Wal-Mart, and
picks up guys at the track. Or the
grandfather who thinks that red pants
look great with a pink shirt and is
currently married to his seventh wife.
Or my favorite - your second cousin
who spends more time in jail than you
spend in the library. It is a universal
law that each family have at least one
eccentric relation.

This common, albeit often hidden,
family theme is embraced by producer,
writer and director John Hughes in his
latest ﬁlm Uncle Buck. The result of '
his latest efforts is an amusing ﬁlm

   
 

that manages to both entertain the
viewer and make the moviegoer plan
on making alternate plans during their
next family reunion.

John Candy is Uncle Buck, a
character who is a 40-year-old tire
salesman who managed to never
completely grow up. He smokes cigars
because he gave up cigarettes, vacu-
ums potato chips from his chest while
watching television and lives in a
house that makes any freshman dorm
room seem immaculate. Sound like a
relative of yours? Candy plays to role
to perfection. This shouldn’t come as
any surprise since Candy has played
variations of Buck Russell in many of
his past film roles, speciﬁcally in ﬁlms
like Splash and Planes, Trains and
Automobiles. The character never starts
to grate on the audience’s nerves
because Candy makes him so believ-
able. He never overacts.

The ﬁlm is at its funniest when

Buck interacts with his two youngest

charges, Miles and Maisy Russell.‘

Many stars hate working with child
actors: who wants to be overshad-
owed by a ﬁve-year—old'.7 Thankfully,
Candy had no problem working with
children, and the comedy in the ﬁlm
is raised several notches in the scenes
where he works with the younger
actors. The kitchen interrogation scene
between Miles and Buck, a wonderful
parody of the old Dragnet television
show, is alone worth the price of
admission.
The ﬁlm is not perfect, however.
It does bog down when Hughes fo-
cuses on the tension between Buck
and his oldest niece, Tia Russell. As
noted before, many of Hughes’ ﬁlms,
like The Breakfast Club and Ferris
Bueller's Day Off, portray teenagers as
misunderstood victims that are alien-
ated from their parents, or the teenag-
ers arc budding comedians who at-

tempt to make adults look like fools
with their rapid-ﬁre wit. The concept
works in previous ﬁlms, but rings
hollow in Uncle Buck. I tired quickly
of Tia’s cheap impersonation of Molly
Ringwald as she poured and snarled
her way through the movie.

Yet Hughes ultimately avoids
becoming his own stereotype, and the
movie doesn't leave the viewer disap-
pointed. The end of the movie will
not surprise anyone as Buck makes
the first decision of his life: should
he return to his carefree life of a
bachelor, or has his week-long baby-
sitting experience started his own
biological clock ticking?

We aren't talking Shakespeare,
folks, but you will come out of the
movie smiling. Peppers will grade it
a “B.” Not a bad mark for the begin-
ning of the school year.

Uncle Buck is currently playing at
the State Theater. It is rated PG for
mild profanity.

And coming in October  Watch for our new bar and lounge

Thank you W&L for making
The FAST LANE such a success!   ?

Marchers
.stop over
on way
to .C.

By Lee Fleming
- Staff Reporter

More than 150 marchers stopped
over in Lexington Tuesday on their
way to a rally for the homeless to
be held in Washington, D.C. on
Oct.7.

X’ The group is part of Housing

'Now, an organization described by
group leader Rev. David Hayden as
“an ad-hoc coalition dedicated to
staging a massive rally, also called
Housing Now, for the homeless.”

Hayden has been an advocate for
the poor and homeless in Roanoke
( for a number of years.

While in Lexington, marchers
stayed in tents on the property of
the New Hope Church of God in
Christ located on Vamer Lane, and
Gladys House, a privately-funded
shelter located next door.

The marchers represent every
southern state except Louisiana,
Hayden said. They assembled in
Roanoke on Sept.l4 and left the
next day in trucks, cars and on foot.

“This is the southern part‘ of the
New Exodus March, a pilgrimage of
the poor out of the South to
Washington. Our people are
equivalent to the poor slaves who
left Egypt in the original Exodus, ”
Hayden said.

The northern section of the New
Exodus left New York at 5 a.m.
Wednesday, he said.

The most signiﬁcant fact about
the marchers, Hayden said, is that
they are largely composed Of
homeless people, or people (Who
- have at one time been homeless.

“We are being led by people
who have slept in the streets, eaten
out of garbage cans, and had
children taken away by social
workers. This is the voice of the
poor being raised up. No longer will
middle—class folks speak for us,” he
said.

Dewayne Saunders, a _marchcr
from Atlanta, said he had just lost
his job when he heard about the
march and Housing Now.

Like most of the other marchers,

many of them illiterate, he said he

learned of the march by “word-of-
‘ mouth."

On 0ct.7, the New Exodus
marchers will join with thousands of
other Americans in Washington for
a rally marching down Constitution
Avenue to the Capitol.

Tax dispute continues

By Jim Pike
and Brian Root
of The Ring-tum Phi staff

Lexington officials remain con-
fused about whether students whose
vehicles are registered outside of
Virginia will have to pay Lex-
ington’s personal property tax.

‘ According to the city’s chief tax
collector, out-of-state students will
not be subject to the tax. But the
city manager, earlier this month,
said students will have to pay the
difference between any taxes at
home and the tax here.

Earlier this week, Lexington
Commissioner of Revenue Courtney
Baker said that, to avoid the tax, a
student car-owner simplyimust show
the city a tax receipt from his home
state.

But Lexington City Manager Jo-
seph King, in a letter to The Ring-
tum Phi dated Sept. 15, stood by his
claim that students may be forced to
pay the difference.

King said that, according to Vir-
ginia law, if an individual can prove
he has paid taxes in a jurisdiction
other than his home - in this case,
Lexington — then he “may obtain a
refund from that jurisdiction.”

The net effect of that law on
students, King said, would be pay-
ing Lexington the difference be-
tween their home-state taxes and
Lexington’s. ‘

But King said that section and
another create “an apparent contra-

I diction.”

Section 58.1-3511 of the code
says, “Any person domiciled in an-
other state, whose motor vehicle is
principally garaged or parked in this
commonwealth during the tax year,
shall not be subject to a personal
tax on such vehicle upon a showing

1989 list of inductees to the
Washington and Lee University‘
Athletic Hall of Fame.

Nash says

Flora, ’58, make up W&L’s second
list of Hall of Fame inductees.

The

Hall of Fame was
established in 1987 by the board of
directors of the W&L Alumni

Association to honor and perpetuate

the memory of those individuals
who have made outstanding
contributions to W&L athletics and
have helped bring recognition,

honor, distinction and excellence to
the university and its intercollegiate
athletic program. The first class was
inducted in the fall of 1988.

Induction ceremonies for the
Hall of Fame will take place during
a banquet the evening of Sept. 22 in
Evans Dining Hall on the W&L
campus. The inductees also will be
recognized during halftime of the
W&L-Centre football game on
Sept. 23.

‘watch out’

in last days of rush

By Brian Root
Senior Copy Editor

With the formal rush period
coming to an end, Washington and
Lee’s fraternities were warned to be
more careful about controlling
underage drinking at parties and to
restrict illegal rush activities.

“Don’t blow it," said IFC
President Kevin Nash at the
lntcrfrateinity Council meeting
Tuesday night. “There's only a
couple more days of Rush left, so
please don’t do anything that could
get you into trouble.”

Nash told the houses two fresh-
men were admitted to Stonewall
Jackson Hospital for alcohol
poisoning, and asked the houses to
carefully watch freshmen for signs
of intoxication.

“This weekend (when freshmen
can accept bids from a house) wil_
.bc worse than normal,” Nash said.\’
“So if you see a freshman drinking

too much,‘ try to slow him down
and get him home safely.”
Nash reminded the houses Live

Drive will be operating this
weekend.
Associate Dean of Students

Leroy C.“Buddy” Atkins asked the
houses to bring what he called a
“traditional sense of decorum”
while freshmen accept their bids on
Friday and Saturday night.

“You have to look at this from
the police’s perspective,” said
Atkins. “If there's a lot of guys
wrestling half-naked around on the
floor after someone tears (accepts
his bid), it looks weird, and it is
weir ."

Atkins said there have been
some complaints to the police
concerning glass bottles
thrown from fraternities.

“The sound of breaking glass is
the first thing the police listen for
to determine if a party has gotten
out of control,” Atkins said.

Iler, at native of Louisville,
Kentucky who still lives there, was
a three-year starter for the Generals,
leading them to a combined record
of 46-16 in that time. Iler was the
trigger man behind a high-powered
W&L offense that featured the likes
of All-American Bob Spessard, who
was among the first class of
inductees to the W&L Athletic Hall
of Fame last year.

A graduate of Louisville Male
High School, Iler was a scrappy
leader who led W&L to a 19-2
record in 1936 and a 17-4 record in
1937, the two best back-to-back
seasons in W&L history. Iler and

Tournament Championship. The
Generals defeated South Carolina,

Fourth sorority named

By Cecily Tynan
Staff Reporter

Delta Gamma, the national sister
fraternity to Phi Delta Theta, was
chosen Thursday evening to be the
fourth women’s fraternity to
colonize at Washington and Lee.

After hearing presentations from
both Delta Gamma and Pi Beta Phi

'last week, the Panhellenic Extension
Committee approved Delta Garrirna’s
application. Then, the committee's

decision was approved by the entire
Panhellenic Council, which
coordinates all sorority matters at
W&L.

“On paper, Delta Garrirna and Pi
Beta Phi were equally strong," said
Wendy Wilson, panhellenic
publicity, housing, and extension
chairwoman. “It basically came
down to the fact that Delta
Gamma‘s presentation was better.”

Delta Gamma was invited to
conduct presentations on 83 college
campuses this year. Of those, only

four were accepted. by the women’s
fraternity.

The Extension Committee is
currently deciding how to
incorporate Delta Gamma into the
formal sorority rush, which is
scheduled for January.

In addition, other details, such as

adding the new sorority to the
Panhellenic letterhead, must be
handled.

“From now on, Delta is

officially part of our Panhellenic
system,” Wilson said.

of sufficient evidence that such per-
son has paid a personal property tax
on the vehicle in the state in which
he is domiciled.”

And King said that section of
the code “indicates that, whatever
personal property tax they may have
paid on out—of-state vehicles, wheth-
er higher or lower, would exempt
them from any local tax.”

Baker, the official responsible
for assessing property taxes, said
she was surprised by the theory that

out-of-state students could have to
pay the difference. She said that, as
far as she knows, there has been no
talk of taxing out—of-state students at
all. But she did not want to speak
further until she could consult King.

Baker later said out-of-state stu-
dents meeting the guidelines set
forth by the Virginia code would be
exempt.

She did say, however, that in-
state students could still be required
to pay a tax.

Senior Copy Editor

Despite Lexington’s six-month
old plans to levy a personal
property tax on cars belonging to
Washington and Lee students, the
city has not yet formally contacted
the school to ask for its cooperation,
said W&L President John D.
Wilson.

“We have not, at least not to
my knowledge, received any official
word from the city that they’ intend
to tax student cars,” Wilson said.

According to Wilson, the only
contact with any city official about
the car tax came when Wilson
wrote a letter early this summer to
Lexington Mayor H.E “Buddy”
Derrick concerning a possibile car
tax. Derrick wrote back, saying the
city did, in his view, have legal
grounds to assess the property tax.

“They (city officials) are under
no obligation to inform us,
however," Wilson said. “I don’t
hold the city in default of any
responsibility to me.”

However, Wilson said, if the city
requests W&L’s list of student car
registration, there may .be legal
questions. The 1974 Buckley
Amendment restricts the release of
student records to any source not
explicitly premitted by the student.

“That law was meant to cover

student transcripts and grade
reports,” Wilson said. “But, it could
be construed to cover car
registrations as well. If we were
asked to provide records of

students’ car registration to the tax-
collecting authorities, we would
certainly have to get a legal opinion
about it.”

“In many instances, we have to
work with the police,” said Wilson.
“Continued good relations with the‘
city are very important.

“Frankly, however, I don’t want
to make Washington and Lee a tax-
collecting agency for the city or
county,”said Wilson.

Wilson said the city could skirt
any possible legal questions by
contacting all of W&L students
instead of attempting to contact only
those who have cars in Lexington.

OPINION

Ignorance breeds‘
racial tensions

Once again a situation has arisen on the Washington
and Lee campus where minority students feel they have
been insulted or alienated by an action or statement.
Unfortunately, these circumstances arise on a relatively
frequent scale due to the ingrained “Old South”
traditionalism and heritage that play such a large role in
W&L’s past and present. Often it is this traditionalism
that leads to complaints from minority students.

An example of the above is the 1988 ‘Minority
Student Association boycott of Fancy Dress, whose
theme that year was “Reconciliation Ball of 1865.”
The president of the MSA maintained that the choice of
theme was made with no consideration for black
students who couldn’t enjoy a theme “set in a period
where blacks were oppressed.”

But the surprise that the non—black students felt is
indicative of what is perhaps the root of the racial tension
at W&L — oversight, insensitivity, unawareness. Perhaps
if we non-minority students were more conscious of the
way certain icons and images appear to minority students
and thought twice before publicly invoking these
controversial icons and images, the racial “tension” (for
lack of a better word) that exists on this campus would be
greatly reduced. All it would require is a bit of
forethought and some consideration. We would like to
believe, as most W&L students probably do, that most
perceived racial affronts are not intentional. We think we
- are beyond being attracted to that ignominious aspect,
although several other admirable and romantic traditions of
the South do still ﬂourish.

But on the other hand (and there always is another
hand), we would also like to point out that despite the
university’s efforts to ease minority students’ transition to
W&L life, that in some ways the university’s attempts
may only be augmenting any problems. Granted, all
segments of the student body have a right and an interest
in maintaining a student organization that furthers their
interests, but it often seems that the university continues
to segregate the minority students, in spirit, at least, far
beyond any social or cultural necessity. There is minority
recruitment, minority counseling, minority orientation,
minority job opportunities, a minority newsletter, a dean
for minority affairs and so on. _low can the university
expect the students to integrate if they are constantly
being reminded that they are in the minority? How can
the majority help but to treat them in a different manner,
since the university has indoctrinated in both the minority

students and the non-rriinority students that they are
' ‘different.’ ’ '

immediately sets the incoming freshman minority students
away from their classmates. The ﬁrst people these
minority students meet are other minority students,’ so
naturally, the first friends these students will have on
campus are other minority students. It seems to be a
somewhat self-defeating cycle.

We can’t help but feel if everyone would stop labelling
these students minority students, that they would perhaps
feel less separated from the rest of the student body. If
one is constantly being reminded of his nationality or
race, it seems to us that it would be a little more difficult
to assimilate.

Also, the extensive attention that the minority students
receive engenders among the non-minority students ' a
feeling that the these students are receiving “special
treatment.” Whether this is the case is not the question,
but once again the separation is widened by the
university’s attempts to welcome the minority students.

So yes, the racial situation is often confusing and
difficult, but it seems that there are logical and simple
solutions that are based in one simple action — being
aware. The university needs to be aware of outside
perceptions of all the minority programming, and how that
affects non-minority students’ viewpoints. As for us
students, we all need to be particularly aware of how
what we say and do impacts those around us, minority
and non-minority students alike, for it requires only an
adult consideration of others, and at this point in our lives
we should all be capable of at least that.

MY VIEW
By James Lake

With the clouds of world war
circling, Winston Churchill observed,
“We seem to be very near the bleak
choice between War and Shame. My
feeling is that we shall choose
Shame, and then have War thrown in
a little later, on even more adverse
terms than at present."

Would that someone had repeated
those words on March 16, 1985. That
was the day Associated Press reporter
Terry Anderson was taken hostage in
Lebanon. Now, more than four years
later and with eight Americans held
hostage instead of one, the shame
keeps mounting. And, this summer,
many Americans added to our shame
tby condemning the one nation ’will-.
lingto try to stop .it: Israel. '

We all know what prompted the
criticism of Israel: the apparent mur-
der of a ninth hostage, U.S. Marine
Lt. Col. William Higgins. and the
videotape thereof. Israel, its critics
say, brought on Higgins’ murder by
kidnapping Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid. And perhaps the critics are
right — by the same reasoning that
says police who arrest thieves lead
thieves’ children to hate the police.

Read a recent headline from U.S.
News & World Report: “Inaction is
another form of hanging.” From that
noose we saw on television, along
with the body of Higgins, hanged
America herself. For even now, when
the hostages are gone from the front
pages and the nightly newscasts, the
U.S. is plagued with what Roger
Rosenblatt of U.S. News calls “this
dreadful impotency, this wasting and
deadening of the rational, decent spir-
it." We are painfully afflicted with a

frustration born not out of failed at-
tempts at retaliation but out of not
even trying to retaliate.

And so, like Great Britain and
France giving Hitler one morsel of
Europe after another, America's
shame mounts. Israel has shown us
an example of moral courage, the
kind President Ronald Reagan exer-
cised occasionally but abandoned in
favor of a disastrous attempt to ap-
pease the hostage—takers’ cohorts. He
disgraced one of his greatest virtues:
moral courage. He shufﬂed the deck
of national priorities and put the
lives of current hostages ahead of the
lives of potential hostages and ahead
of our nation's honor. Such a re-
stacking is politically easy, because
most American voters are too short-
sighted to realize that the deaths of
soldiers and today's hostages may be
the price for an end to the nightmare
and for the security of future travel-

ers. George Bush, if he ever owned!-
tliis courage — and one supposes the'
World War H pilot once did — has‘
either abandoned it or subordinated itr
to other goals. f
Courage does not mean rage. '
There is a rational answer to the hos- y
tage problem, an answer that will
risk lives, but an answer that will "
give the surviving hostages freedom..
and, history has taught us, will pre- A
vent future captures. It is an answer 5
the Israelis would support, an answer 
some former hostages support, an
answer that will work. t
First, we must accept as fact what
we know but perhaps cannot prove: ”
that the Iranians have the power to .
free the hostages. Second, we must
force Iran to do just that. How? Two '*

THE SBAR SIDE
By John Sbar

Recently I woke up with a headache, a stuffy
nose and thousands of chirping crickets ewho are
under the impression that my bedroom is a Certi-
fied Cricket Migration Zone. Therefore, I left for
the school infirmary, abandoning my domicile to
the crickets who would spend the day breeding,
jumping up and down, and ﬁguring out why I
sometimes refer to my bedroom as a domicile. At

‘the infirmary I read pamphlets on the subject of

sexually-transmitted diseases, drug abuse, and why
you shouldn't scratch your genital area when you
have poison ivy. Once admitted to the doctor I sat
down, scratched my genital area, and vowed to
stop writing rythmic sentences with three—pronged
descriptive phrases.

While the doctor killed time checking me out
with her orifice-probing devices, I wondered how
long it would take her to declare my illness a

normal process of orifice-probing, Viral Infection
Declaration and horse-pill dispensation, the doctor
declared my illness a cut lip, and proceeded to
give me painful Novacain shots and four stiches.

The obvious lesson to be learned from my
infirrnary experience is this: Mere mortals who
tempt Fate and forget to knock on some wood-
en surface afterwards will become the butt of
one of Fate’s many jokes. Of course, this wasn't
the first time an article got me in trouble with
Fate. Last year, ten minutes after writing in sup-
port of the famous “Milk Bone Arziendment"
which would have outlawed leashes and other
dog—restn'cting devices, I rode my bike by a big
bloodthirsty German Shepherd who just so hap-
pened to be off-leash. This dog who made Rin-
tin-tin look like Morris the Cat, chased me for
about a mile until I narrowly escaped by riding
straight into the Maury River.

Oh... by the way, in case you're wondering, I
cut my lip fighting off six-armed Ninjas who
ambushed me in the library elevator. Contrary to
a popular rumor. I was not elbowed in the mouth
during water nolo practice.

Trees spotted,
forest missed,
says student

On May 4 last spring, I wrote a “My
View” discussing Michigan State University’s
affirmative action policy. At Michigan State,
students complete general education require-
ments, and then apply for admission to the
various schools (business, education, etc). In
the formula used, points are added to the
scores of minority students, as an affirmative
action policy. I stated that this policy was ef-
fectively discriminatory, providing some stu-
dents with an advantageous position because of
their race. A policy such as this hurts every-
one. Descrving non-minority students are de-
nied a place in the school of their choice, and
deserving minority students are cheapened to
the extent that this allows their detractors to
attribute their success to race and not ability.
The only persons who benefit are undeserving
minority students who would not have been

' able to gain admission without special treat-
ment.

In the May 18 issue of The Ring—tum Phi,
Joyce G. MacDonald took me to task regarding
the use of the passive voice in my column,

‘saying, “Choosing the passive instead of the
"active voice enables the writer, consciously or
unconsciously, to fudge an apparently definite
position, to distance himself from conclusions
whose implications he may not be ready to
embrace fully or even recognize.”

couldn't swallow, and sent me on my way.

‘Ms. MacDonald appears to have missed the
proverbial forest due to her close scrutiny of
the trees. Apparently, in the course of her en-
thusiastic quest to criticize my writing style,
she chose to ignore the thrust of my argu-
ments. She accuses me of “fudging an appar-
ently definite position,” but retreats from chal-
lenging my position. My view is quite simple,
to the extent that affirmative action singles out
a minority, it is discriminatory. Referring to it
as anything else involves a semantic game
contrived to camouﬂage its true nature.

Finally, I must take issue with Ms. Mac-
Donald’s assertion that “racist reactions both
follow affirmative action policies and necessi-
tated their introduction.” First, outraged reac-
tions from non-minority students who have
been deprived opportunities as a result of affir-
mative action are not racist. The reaction is not
to the race of the person who took their place
as a result of affirmative action, but rather a
reaction to a policy which allows someone an
unfair advantage over them. Their reaction is
not that of a Ku Klux Klan member to a mi-
nority member moving into the neighborhood,
but rather that of an athlete who discovers that
the officials have been bought by the other
team.

Although I strongly support equal opportu-
nity, and am opposed to discrimination on the
basis of race, sex, creed, or color, I can see no
need for affirmative action. As I said in my
earlier opinion, affirmative action is just anoth-
er name for officially sanctioned discrimination.
A rose by any other name...

Construction of Washington and
‘ Lee's new center for the performing
,, arts, the Lenfest Center, is progress-

‘ , ing as scheduled and, should be

fcompleted by August of 1990, ac-
the university's fine arts department.
__ project began in the summer of 1988

‘ donation earmarked for the fine arts

’ center from Mr. and Mrs. Gerry Len-

§fest of Huntingdon Valley, Penn.

‘Lenfest is a 1954 graduate of Wash-

’- ington and Lee.

I In addition to the $9.8 million
éconstruction costs, the university’s
board of trustees has created a $2

4' million endowment, which it says will
 ensure the highest quality arts program
“ for the school and surrounding area.
‘University officials are nearing the
completion of their fund-raising cam-
Qpaign, thanks in part to the “sale”
gof theater seats.
University officials have asked
(Washington and Lee alumni and

*_ friends and local patrons of the arts
to “buy" seats in the 425-seat theater
9 in order to complete fund-raising for
the center. For $2,500, a donor can

I bestow his name and financial support,

‘or honor someone else, while at the
same time support the construction and

' endowment of the theater. Every seat
, that is sold will be marked with a

plaque bearing the name of the donor

I or someone the donor wishes to honor.

The seat-selling campaign was

started last October, and thus far 79

V seats have been sold, according to
‘ Charlene Whiteside of the university’s

development office. Whiteside said
1 donations have been steady since

enactment of the program.

According to Gordon, a number
sof parents of current Washington and
4‘ Lee students have "named a seat” in

honor of their children. In addition, a

‘number of local residents have contrib-

uted to the cause. “Naming a seat in
‘ the theater provides the opportunity for
4. local people to contribute to the build-
ing and be recognized for their sup-

port," Gordon said.

4 The center will be located diago-
nally across from Gaines Hall. En-

ltrance to the center’s upper and lower
«levels will be through a gatehouse
tower, the design of which has been
borrowed from the Gaines Hall gate-
ghouse.

According to a W&L news release,
‘the Lenfest Center's main theater will
‘seat 425, and the rise is designed to

insure that every member of the audi-

V fence has an unobstructed view of the
stage. The stage’s design will allow
for a variety of stage sizes, ranging
l~from very small to multi-level sets, the
release said. The stage will also fea-

Joint courthouse
still a possiblity

 

By Brooke Jarbek
Staff Reporter

The Rockbridge County Board
of Supervisors last week announced
that it would ‘reconsider its original
rejection of joint courthouse facili-
ties for Lexington and Rockbridge
County.

The County Board members or-
iginally rejected the proposal by
Guy 0. Farley for the jointufacitities
because of the $1 million price tag.
However, Farley told both Lexing-
ton City Council and the county's
supervisors that the cost could be
reduced, by issuing industrial reve-
nue bonds and financing the project
through the Industrial Development
Association.

Both city and county officials
agreed that action to start building
the facilities should begin immedi-
ately.

Juvenile and Domestic Relations
Judge Robert S. Culpcpper said
there is “an emergency need to
have a new building.”

Currently, both the county and
city courts are overcrowded, have
no disability access, no meeting
rooms for attorneys and clients, no
holding rooms, no conference rooms
for judges and limited parking.

The problem surfaced more than
two years ago when judges for the
General District Court and Juvenile
and Domestic Relations Courts,

which altemated between the city
and County courthouses, complained
about i!1C space conditions, said
Mayor HE. “Buddy” Derrick, Jr.

Culpcpper said a joint court
would be more convenient for
Rockbridge and Lexington residents
because a citizen would only have
to go to one location.

Judge Joseph E. Hess, who
serves in the Lexington and Rock-
bridge, .County General. District
Courts, said he often sends people
to the other courthouse when they
mistakenly come to him for a juve-
nile-related offense.

“We do not have the
opportunity to grow,
we are not going to
have more retail es-
tablishments. ”
— Buddy Derrick

§)en‘ick said that no matter how
the new court facilities are ﬁnanced,
it is important for them to be within
the corporate city limits.

Unlike Rockbridge County, we
do not have the opportunity to
grt;'.v,” the mayor said. “We are
not going to have more retail estab-
lishmcnts. We have always served
as county seat and service center for
the community, and we feel that
that is where our future lies."

The Spectator no

By Cathy Loplccolo
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee's newest
publication, the ’Spectator, will be
produced this year despite the
refusal by the Publications Board to
recognize and fund the news and
opinion journal, the magazine's
editor-in-chief predicted. _

“The Spectator is alive,
certainly. The Spectator is going to
come out,” junior Paul Lagarde
said.

Plans for the Spectator are still
being discussed, said Lagarde, and
the staff does not know when the
first issue will be published.
Because the Spectator was denied
recognition as an official school
publication, the magazine's only
issue was funded by the staff, he
said.

This year, according to junior
Ray Welder, the magazine's
publisher, the magazine is relying
on donations. "We‘ve gone to
grandmothers, mothers, fathers and
everyone else for help,” he said.

“So far we've collected about
$400, which is not enough to put
out a magazine. We hope to get
donations from sympathetic alunmi
and from advertising,” said Welder.
“Hopefully the first issue will be as

good a product as possible, to
attract financial support.”
Lagarde and Welder, who

founded the Spectator last winter,
presented the magazine to the
Publications Board in an attempt to
become a recognized school
pttblication and to receive school
funding. That board supervises all

VMI waiting
for decision

By Courtney Payne
Staff Reporter

Virginia Military Institute of-
ficials are still waiting to find
out if their school will become
coeducational, Public Irtforrnation
Director Tom Joynes said Tues-
day.

A letter from a northern Vir-
ginia high school student
prompted the U.S Department of
Justice to inquire into the admis-'
sions policies of the college.
The letter was from a female
who was interested in applying
to VMI but told she could not
because they only accept men.

The last official correspon-
dence regarding the matter was
an April 28 reply to the Justice
Department inquiry from Maj.
Gen. John Knapp, Acting Super-
intendent and Dean. The college
and the Justice Department,
however, are not the only parties
involved.In a letter to VMI
Board of Visitors President Jo-
seph M. Spivey III, Virginia
Governor Gerald Baliles wrote,
“I have searched for  ration-
ales to discover moral, legal or
educational judgement why
women, for no reason other than
their gender, should be denied
admission to VMI. My search

university‘ publications, chooses their
editors and approves publication
budgets.

According to Lagarde, the board
granted his magazine “provisional"
approval so that his staff could use
equipment in The Ring-tum Phi
office for their issue, but the board
refused to provide university funds.

Senior Kristi Goodman, chairman
of the Publications Board and editor

of the Political Review, said the
board refused to recognize the
Spectator primarily because its

members felt the magazine would
duplicate the purpose of other
school publications.

“The Spectator is

Also, Goodman said, a secondary
concern of the board was that the
students who run the Spectator
would advocate conservative
ideology through the magazine. The

Publications Board's constitution

bans recognition of any publication »

it determines “states and/or
demonstrates a political or cultural
ideology.”

Lagarde said the monthly
“Spectrum” would allow for more
in-depth analysis of issues than is
possible in weekly publications, like
The Ring-tum Phi, but would be
more frequent than the Political
Review. He also said the magazine
would accept articles from people

with all political views, although he

admitted the majority of the students
on the Spectator staff are
conservative.

“One thing we'd always want is
a pro-con or conservative-liberal
debate. That argument is always a
highlight of a publication and is one
of the most important things in the
Spectator. But issues may rtot
always be conservative or liberal,"
Lagarde said.

Last spring the board imple-
mented a procedure for recognizing
school publications, in response to
several requests for approval during
the last two years. Welder said
these new guidelines are “strin-
gent,” and he does not know if the
Spectator would be eligible for
approval this year.

The new Publications Board
would be willing to reconsider the
Spectator, Goodman said.

“With the exception of myself,
we have an all-new Publications
Board. We have a new group with
new opinions. I'm willing to
listen,” Goodman said. “I have not
talked to the new members about it,
so I don't know their opinions.”

Welder and Lagarde said they
see some advantages to being
independent from the board, such as
the freedom to choose their own
editors. However, they said not
receiving university funding is a
major disadvantage.

“We're going to do our best to
be as independent as possible,"
Welder said,“but we may not be
able to afford it.”

Construction will begin on the

new franchise of the national fast-

Stan Seymour, controller of the pro-

Wal-Mart in the Lexington Cross-

miles east of Lexington on Highway

“Hopefully, ‘we'll be open for

The Washington and Lee Student
Activities Board said it will be
cutting back expenses on this year's
Fancy Dress Ball because of the
reduction in its overall budget for
the 1989-90 school year, the
Executive Committee said at its
meeting Monday night.

According to the EC, the Fancy
Dress expense reduction was one of
several issues concerning the SAB
budget that were discussed in a
meeting last week between members
of the SAB, EC and Associate Dean

of Students Leroy C.“Buddy"
Atkins.

The SAB representatives said
they would be emphasizing

organization and communication this
year. In addition, the SAB said its
weekly meetings will be more
structured and procedures will be
written for members outlining their
duties.

Atkins requested that the EC
outline its general objective
concerning the SAB. He also said
he thinks the SAB should be given
more lead time on budget estimates.

This year, the SAB has come
under increased scrutiny because it
amassed a debt of about $20,000
over the past several years.

EC President Willard Dumas
said he would like to see the SAB
meet with the EC before major
decisions are made.

The EC said it will have its next
meeting with the SAB before
Homecoming weekend.

 Sheriff department
 to augment forces

 

By Karsten Amlle
Staff Reporter

The Rockbridge County Board
of Supervisors is trying to get more
manpower and better equipment for
the sheriff’s department.

The supervisors unanimously
voted to send a resolution to state
representatives that would request
more manpower be allocated to the
county sheriff’s department.

The vote, which took place at
Monday's Board of Supervisors
meeting, came in the wake of a
shooting incident that occurred last
Saturday in Natural Bridge in which
a sheriff’s deputy and a County Su-

pervisor were both shot. Neither
men were seriously injured.
The shooting incident also

prompted serious and extensive dis-
cussions that led to the Board tak-
ing action to permit certain correc-
tional officers at the Rockbridge Re-
gional Jail to take weapons home.
This would allow off-duty officers
to come to the assistance of sher-
iff’s deputies in emergencies.

The supervisors also said that
they would look into the feasibility
of providing officers with shotguns
and portable radios.

However, the problem that the
-Supervisors and the law enforcement
officers who attended the meeting
spent the most time discussing was
the serious lack of manpower in the
sheriff’s department.

The ratio that the state uses in
allocating funds to sheriff’s depart-
ments is one deputy per 2,000 peo-
ple and one dispatcher 35,000 peo-
ple.

Rockbridge County's sheriff’s
department has 13 deputies to cover
the 600 iriiles of square land. This
only leaves the County with three or
four deputies per shift. It also places
the deputies on a demanding work
schedule; one that Captain Ronald
Hall of the sheriff’s department says
has many deputies putting in a great
deal of overtime.

Sheriff F.M. Spence says that his
office is overworked and could use

twice as many men as they have
now. Unfortunately as long as the
state demands the 2,000 people to
one officer ratio, the sheriff’s de-
partment will very undoubtedly be
permitted to employ more dispatch-
ers or officers.

"If we were fortunate enough to
pick up five men then we would
really feel lucky," said Spence. The
Supervisors voted to ask the

.county’s representatives in the Gen-

eral Assembly to work to get the
state Compensation Board to alter
its funding formula to take into ac-
count not only population but the
size and the" terrain of a county
such as Rockbridge, as well.

Officials of both Lexington and
Rockbridge County are considering
a merger between the two localities
as one way to combat increasing
financial strains.

H.E “Chunk” Neale, Rockbridge
County Supervisor for the Walker’s

because, he says, taxpayers would
have to pay less for such services
as heating, electricity, and water.

Taxes have consistently been
raised in Lexington. The city has a

The Methodist College Monarchs are in their first
year of NCAA football, and last Saturday against the

ESPORTS

Washington and Lee Generals, mistakes, along with a

torrential rain, spelled doom for the first year team.

In front of just over 1,000 fans at Wilson field for
the Generals’ 1989 home opener, Methodist received
the ball to start the game. On their first play from
scrimmage, W&L senior Scott Silverrnan hit Monarch
ball carrier Brett Baxley as he went into the line and
jarred the ball loose. The Generals recovered on the
Methodist 20-yard line. It would be the first of six

turnovers on the day. Methodist fumbled nine times, In the third quancr, it was more of the Same_

losing five.

From there, the Generals‘ offense took over. Junior,
tailback Mason Pope went 12-yards on the first play,
and two plays later, he was on the receiving end of
senior quarterback Phillip Sampson’s first touchdown
pass on the day. The game was 1:10.

Soccer stops Sweet Briar,

By Holly Gooding
Staff Reporter

Three years of hard work are

beginning to pay off for the
Washington and Lee women's
soccer team.

The Generals defeated Old

Dominion Athletic Conference foe
Sweet Briar College 1-0 in a muddy
battle at home last Saturday, and
tied battled ODAC rival Hollins to a
0-0 deadlock in two overtimes at

 ‘I-Iollins on Monday.

The lone goal on Saturday came
midway through the first half.
Freshman midfielder Andrea

-Cardamone broke free and drove the

ball into the goal. Excellent team
defense limited the scoring. The
Generals managed 21 shots on goal
while holding the Vixens to none.
On Monday, the Generals
uavelcd to Hollins ready to continue
their high level of play. Said W&L
head coach Jan Hathorn of the play

Corrections

In last week’s women‘s soc-

cer article, Catherine Baillio was
incorrectly identified as a team
captain. The co-captains are Sa-
rah Allen and Joelle Jackson.
Sweet Briar is not the defending
ODAC champions, but ended the
Generals’ season last year in the
tournament semifinals. Also, the
midfield line head coach Jan
Hathom referred to consisted of
Ginny Dallarn, Wendy Miles,
Ann Shaughncssy, Jackson and
Britney Bates. Morgan Warner
was injured and did not play and
Paige Kilian is now a team man-
ager.

it consistently.”

Both teams battled hard, neither

— Jan Hathorn

Generals for the second straight
game, keeping Hollins off the board.
Hathom especially cited the play
of the forward ling (Catherine
Baillie, Susan Moseley, and Ashley
Gray), and that of sophomores
Nancy Mitchell and Ashley Hurt,
but added that “absolutely everyone
that I put in [the game] played a
great game."

Despite the fine play, Hathom
still admits that the Generals still
have work to do. “We were all
over them and couldn't put the ball
in the goal."

Hathom feels that the next few
games should put the team's ability
to the test. “We still have a long
road ahead of us. Marymount and
Randolph-Macon (Ashland) will be
two very tough games.”

Next up for the Generals, 2-2-1,
2-1-1 in conference play, will be
road games at Marymount and
ODAC foe Randloph-Macon. The

Last year, the Washington and
Lee volleyball team opened the
season by capturing the Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College
tournament.

The Generals defeated all comers
on their way to their second straight
title, coming up with wins over host
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College,
Sweet Briar, Mary

W&L fought through some tough
situations to win 9 of 10 games
played. The Generals’ only loss was
to Sweet Briar who took the first of
two games by a score of 15-11, but
the Generals team rallied for
revenge in the second, routing the
Vixens 15-2.

In the round robin tournament,
each team played two games against
each school. If the teams split the
two games, the tie-breaker would be
decided by the combined point
spread in the two games.

Mena McGowin, a stand-out
sophomore from Mobile, Ala., led
the team with an average of 2.5
kills per game. Leslie Hess was also
an effective hitter, killing balls at an
average of 1.9 per game. Lisa Jay,
the Generals’ captain, also had an

outstanding tournament, compiling
56 assists.
Said McGowin, “The team

showed a great effort hitting the ball
hard, and diving for a lot of balls
that I didn't think could possibly be
saved. We were down in some of
our games, but were able to come
together when we needed to.”

The Generals will be on the road
this weekend for the Bridgewater

' College Tournament, and will return

home on Thursday, September 28,
for games against Bridgewater and
Shenandoah in the Warner Center.

The Washington and Lee water
polo team returned triumphant from
their weekend trip to Boston,
winning the Northeastern Varsity
Invitational.

The Generals were lifted by fine
goaltending by senior David Olson
and a balanced offense paced by
freshman Scott Strader’s eleven

team had to overcome an inspired
MIT club playing at home.

All the classic elements for an
upset were there, but W&L
overcame the unfamiliar pool and
the partisan MIT crowd to escape
with a 10-8 win behind three goals
apiece from Strader, freshman Chris
Hagge, and junior Tomas Perez.

— Page Remillard

“The MIT game was the key,"
said Remillard. “Everyone wanted
to see them win, [but] we needed to
play with the cards we were dealt
with and we did it. We got
composure out of that game.”

After the semifinal win over
MIT, the finals seemed a bit anti-
climatic. The Generals nudged past
Villanova, upset winners over
Richmond, by a margin of 10-6.

“I'm very pleased with the
progress we’re making,” Remillard
said. “We’re playing so much as a
team. We don't have a standout

  

The l-?ing- tum Phi 

player. It would have been easy for
them to listen to their critics — [but]

we’re building something pretty
good.”

Nonetheless, there is still work
to be done in the eyes of the coach
and players. The team trailed at one
point in each of the weekend games
with the exception of Fordham, and
Remillard acknowledges that he
wants his team to improve its set

offense and become more proficient
in its supplementary defense.

Said co-captain Olson, “We're
pleased with the weekend results,
but at the same time we know we
need to play better in the future to
accomplish our goals — and we can
play better.”

Olson’s work in the goal has
been a major reason that the
Generals are undefeated after eight
games. Olson's work in goal, said
Remillard, “was definitely the best
in the toumament.”

This weekend, the team travels
to Fredericksburg for the Virginia
State Championships. The chief
competition for the Generals should
be the arch-rival Richmond Spiders.
The teams would meet in the finals,‘
a game that Remillard professes to
be “pessimistic” about. It should be
a match between W&L’s team
speed and balance; and Richmond’s
experience and individual talent.

Iler was voted All-Southcm
Conference three straight years, and
in 1936, he was the only unanimous
selection on the team. For his
efforts, Iler was later named an
All-American by the Helms Athletic
Foundation. He was also a
tliree-year standout for the W&L
baseball team and served as captain
of the team his senior year. He
helped the 1935 team to a record of
17-4-2, which still stands today as
the most wins in one season for a
W&L baseball squad.

Called by some the greatest
Split-T quarterback in history,
Gilbert (Gil) Bocettl, Jr. stands as
one of the most electrifying football
quarterbacks Washington and Lee
has ever had. Bocetti, who now
lives in Durham, N.C., was a
two-time All-Southcm Conference
selection at quarterback, receiving
the honor in both 1950 and 1951.
He led the 1950 W&L squad to an
8-3 record and a spot in the 1951
Gator Bowl, W&L’s first and only
appearance in a post-season bowl
game. Under Bocetti, W&L
compiled a 17-12-1 record and won
the Southern Conference
Championship in 1950.

Men find 2-1 scores tough to overcome

After starting the season at home
with a 5-3 victory against Denison,
the Washington and Lee men's
soccer team played three road
games this week, and lost each by a
2-1 score.

On Friday, the Generals headed
to Baltimore and played Johns
Hopkins (3-1) and Camegie—Mellon
(3-0) on astroturf in a weekend
tournament. On Tuesday the team
travelled to North Carolina and
took on Guilford (3-2).

In the first game, Hopkins led 2-

netted his fourth goal of the season
to keep the Generals close.

Neither team managed to score
during the second half, as Hopkins’
halftime lead proved to be the final
score.

Head coach Rolf Piranian
focused on the execution of the
game plan and the team’s intensity.
“We didn't play our game. We
played right into their strength by
trying to play in the air, and they
were much bigger than us.”

Corbin got the start in goal and

W&L maintain a 0-0 tie at the half.
Camegie—Mellon had a 2-0 lead in
the second half before freshman
midﬁelder Reid Murphy scored his
ﬁrst collegiate goal with about five
minutes remaining in the contest.

Piranian admitted that adjusting
to astroturf makes a slight
difference, but “that shouldn't have
affected us in terms of intensity.”
He also said that “this tournament
gave us a good reading of who our
top eleven are. Corbin is now our
number one goalkeeper."

he set a national single-game record
for total offense with 340 yards
against Davidson. After his senior
season, Bocetti played in both the
North-South College All-Star Game
and the Blue—Gray All-Star game.
The Generals’ quarterback is best
remembered for his stirring
performance in leading W&L to a
shocking 42-14 upset of Virginia in
1951.

Ernest J. (Skip) Lichtfuss, Jr.,
was a standout in both lacrosse and
basketball, leading W&L to regional
and national prominence in both
sports.

Lichtfuss, a native of Towson,
Md. who now resides in Baltimore,
was W&L’s leading scorer in
basketball as a sophomore, a junior
and a senior, and he helped W&L
to the College Athletic Conference
basketball championship in 1971 and
1972. In addition, he led the
Generals in steals, assists and
rebounds in both his junior and
senior seasons. Lichtfuss, who
served as captain of the team during
the 1973-74 season, finished his
W&L career with 1,592 career
points to make him the fifth all-time
leading scorer in W&L history. He
was named an Honorable Mention
All-American after his senior year.

As a lacrosse player, Lichtfuss
helped W&L to an .877 winning
percentage over four years. Lichtfuss
was named a Second Team
All-America midﬁelder in 1972 and
was elevated to First Team

Silva scored an unassisted goal to
put the Generals up 1-0. Midway
through the second half, Guilford
knotted the score at 1-1.

The match headed into overtime,
and Guilford scored the garne-

winning goal on diving header off
of a crossing pass ﬁve minutes into
the first overtime. W&L hammered
away at the Guilford goal for fifteen
minutes of the second overtime and
got off three solid shots.

Guilford’s defense held firm, and
the Generals headed back to
Lexington with a 2-1 overtime
defeat.

A disappointed Piranian said
after the loss, “We played far
below the intensity and skill level
expected for this team. It wasn’t a
proud day for our kids."

member of the class of 1913 and
was an outstanding second baseman
and captain on the baseball team. It
was as a coach and administrator,
however, that Cap’n Dick made his
mark on W&L athletics. Cap’n Dick
became athletic director in 1921 and
remained in that post until his
retirement in 1954. He coached
baseball for 30 years from 1922-52,
during which his teams won one
Southern Conference championship
and several Virginia Big Six titles.
Cap’n Dick also coached the
basketball team from 1926-30, and
his teams posted a combined mark
of 32-6 from 1928-30.

Under Srnith’s leadership, W&L
developed one of the most
comprehensive intercollegiate and

intramural athletic programs in the

  

 

Southern Conference. He was also
one of the most inﬂuential figures
in the early history of the league,
and at the time of his retirement, he

was recognized as the dean of
Southern Conference athletic

‘Domlnlck A. (Dom) Flora was a

dazzling four-year starter on W&L
basketball teams from 1954 through
1958. Known for his deadly
jump-shooting ability and his ﬂashy,
but crisp ball-handling skills, Flora
averaged 21 points per game over
his career at W&L. He finished his
career in Lexington with 2,310
points, the fifLh—highest point total
in college basketball at the time and
still the all-time mark at W&L.
Flora was a master at scoring, even
against defenses that were designed
specifically to stop him.

Flora, who graduated in 1958,
was named a first team All-America
by the Helms Athletic Foundation in
1958, a squad that included such
players as Elgin Baylor, Oscar
Robertson and Wilt Chamberlain.
He was named Player of the Year
in the Southern Conference and the
Virginia Big Six, and was named to
the Associated Press All-Southem
Conference team for two
consecutive years.

Flora, who makes his home in
Maplewood, N.J., was also a star on
the baseball diamond, where he
played shortstop as a freshman,
second base as a sophomore and
centerfield and pitcher as a junior
and senior.

must pull those strings tight.
The plan is simple. Bush appears
on television and tells the world we

reinstate that order if the hostages’
ﬂight to freedom is in any way hin-
dered or imperiled. If any hostages
are killed, targets on the Iranian
mainland will also be bombed.

If Iran does not budge, the bomb-
ers would strike as promised. Pilots
and planes would perhaps be lost.
After the bombing, the Iranians
would perhaps do nothing, or perhaps
allow a hostage to be killed or in
some other way fail to obey. In such
a case, the same scenario must be
repeated. The president armounces
another target, with the same 48-hour
deadline.

Eventually. Iran will have no
choice but to capitulate. Just like
Americans, some Iranians are willing
to die when C()ll'\‘IIlC€d their cause is

Such a policy would succeed. But "
implementation would require a de—:
gree of courage, commitment and'»’
leadership we have not seen from"
Bush. And the power of today’s
Neville Cliamberlains, those who in-’’
sist on efforts to appease so--called ’
moderates in Iran and seek to strike
only those who personally hold the ’
hostages, is insurance that the night-
mare will continue.

And so, even after the image nt 5
the noose has faded from the screen,"
scoundrcls still have their way, and’,
the body still hangs liinply. And the
shame will keep on mounting, until
America comes to understand that
loss of life is at times the price of
security, liberty and honor. T':e status
quo guarantees the seizure of more -'
innocents and the continuing ens1ave- .
ment of us all. ‘

4 Despite problems paying debts

i

from the 1888-89 school year, the
Executive Committee has made ﬁnal
,. this year’s budget.

Some organizations had their

‘budgets frozen, and others face cuts
, due to the money constraints.

The Student Bar Association, a

,, largest budgets, received the same

“There may be
tightening, but that's
to be true of every
organization.” The SBA received

the $35,000 requested. This amount

4 was “pared down because of budget

cuts from the $77,000 in requests

‘we received from organizations,”

said Falk.

One of the campus organizations
that was denied a considerable sum
was the Minority Students’
Association. Of the $6,400 asked
for, the MSA received only $2,000.
James Rambeau, president of the
MSA, said, “the primary focus of

 ., I  3

n stom’ wake

our budget is on speakers. We had
planned on two speakers that would
cost $4,000.” Despite -the but the
organization should still be able to
put on much of its originally
planned activities by ﬁnding other
organizations to cosponsor speakers,
he said.

Not all campus organizations
rely completely on money from the
EC. The Caybc, for example, asks
for money from parents and alumni
to meet production costs.

“The Calyx, Journal of Science
and The Ring-tum Phi are all part of
the Publications Board. This is
where money goes when we make a
profit and, when debt is incurred,
the money comes out of that
account," said Calyx editor Suzanne
Snead.

The price of production of the
yearbook has risen $1,000 ‘since last
year, _ and photography developing
costs will be more as well, Snead
said. But The Calyx received
$15,000, the same amount as last

year. “We'll have to operate on a
tighter budget and cut some
comers, ” said Steven Wight, the

yearbook’s budget director.

Members of the 1989 Fancy
Dress Committee and student
representatives to the faculty
Executive Committee were named at
Monday's student EC meeting.

“The EC appointed whom they
thought would do the best job,
given the candidates’ past
experience,” said EC President
Willard Dumas, although he said

‘past experience’ ’ does not
necessarily mean experience on the
SAB or experience at W&L. The
Fancy Dress chairman is junior
Richard Spence, the vice chair is
junior Alex Hitz, and the auditor is
junior Terrence Fowler. The Law
School publicity director for the
SAB is third—year law "student
Martika Parson.

. Other appointed committee
fiiembers were Kara Cunningham to
the Faculty Executive Committee,
Tom Reems and Chris Smith to
Courses and Degrees, and John
Thorson and John Neslage to
Freshman Admissions. The EC is
still accepting applications to the

Ten Washington and Lee stu-
dents needed emergency care at
Stonewall Jackson Hospital this
weekend due to a1cohol—related inju-
ries, nearly equalling the total of
injuries from the two previous
weekends, according to Washington
and Lee Health Services records.

All of the students were treated
for head and facial injuries, includ-
ing lacerations, black eyes, broken
teeth and a possible broken nose.
All the students were released short-

Although the formal phase of
fraternity Rush ended last Saturday,
W&L men who have itot pledged
can participate in the more informal
deferred rush period, said
Interfratemity Council President
Kevin Nash at the IFC meeting
Tuesday night. '

Deferred rush begins
immediately following the end of
fomtal rush, and any W&L male
who is not currently a member of a
house is eligible to participate.

There are no specific events
sponsored by either the IFC of the
university for the deferred rush
period.

Nash said no rushees cart accept

The number of injuries is twice
as many as occured over the school
year’s first weekend, .vlten there
were five alcohol-related injures,
and nearly twice as many from last
weekend, when six were treated and
released from Stonewall Jackson.

Meanwhile, Lexington police re-
ported only five violations over the
past weekend, with no arrests.
Three tickets were handed out for
minors in possession of alcohol, one
for a noise violation, and one for a
littering violation.

Lexington Police Chief Bruce
Beard once again stated he was
“very pleased" with the conduct of

bids offered during deferred rush

until after Homecoming weekend,_

.two weeks from now.

No houses complained about the
new structure for rush. This year,
for the first time, the lists for Rush
Dates were compiled by computer.

“If anyone has any complaints,
please let us know about them,"
Nash said. “We’re always looking
to improve the Rush structure."

David Allen, speaking for the
IFC’s recycling rogram, asked the
houses to contribute empty beer
cans to be taked to the Rockbridge
Recycling Center.

“Recycling these cans is the
only thing that the center makes any
money from,” Allen said. “With all
the cans you go through, giving
them to the center would help them

“If we could continue this rela-
tionship, it would be great,” said
Beard.

Beard, who two weeks ago was
concerned about street congestion,
stated that the weekend's cool wea-
ther reduced street traffic, thus mak-
ing their job easier.

Destruction and misconduct in
the freshman dorms were “typical”
for tear weekend, according to
Dorm Counselor Mary Alice Mc-
Morrow. She reported that there
were only a few “isolated inci-
dents,” which she blamed on the
excitement of tear weekend parties.

out a lot.”

Allen said the cans would be
collected every Monday, and asked
the houses to bag the cans and label
them, to make collection easier:

In other business, Nash asked
the houses to rum in a list of the

names of each house’s newly-
acquired pledges.
In addition, each house must

turn in a detailed accounting of how
much money was spent during rush.

IFC Vice President Hunt
Neidringhaus reminded‘ the
fraternities of the regulation

restricting each house to only four
parties in the house per month.

“Since it was Rush, every house
used up all four allowed parties in
the past couple weeks,"
Neidringhaus said.

Washington and Lee's fraternity
rush was relatively uneventful and
“OK overall,” Interfratemity Coun-
cil President Kevin Nash said Tues-
day night.

Speaking after the first post-
Rush IFC meeting, Nash said there
were successes and failures in
W&L’s 1989 Rush. ,

“It really depends on which way
you look at it,” he said. “In terms
of the fraternities‘ interaction with
the community and the police, it‘
went very well. There were fewer
visits by the police, and noise viola-
tions were down. There were also
fewer students admitted to the hos-

Nash sees pluses,

pital.”

Lexington Police Chief Bruce
Beard agreed, according to Nash,
who said the chief plans to attend
an IFC meeting soon to congratulate
the fraternities on a job well done.

Nash also said that W&L
President John Wilson plans to at-
tend an IFC meeting, possibly on
Oct. 10.

On the negative side, Nash said
that the IFC is still concerned about
some students “suiciding” at one
fraternity house and not receiving a
bid at that house. “Suiciding” is
rush jargon for attending only one
house’s rush functions at the risk of
not receiving a bid.

“We’re still trying to prevent
rushees from doing that. It's really

minuses

disappointing,” said Nash.

Nash estimated that 10-15 rush-
ees were “caught” suiciding.

In general, however, Nash said,
“Most feedback about the process
has been good.”

The most positive aspect of this
year’s Rush was the wider variety
of houses being considered by fresh-

_men, Nash said.

“I thought it was positive that
this year’s freshmen didn't narrow
the houses into a mold of North and
South," Nash said. “Many rushed
at a variety. of houses instead of
going with the stereotypes."

Assistant Dean of Students
Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins said
Tuesday he was reserving comment
“until all the figures are in."

Officer Smith gets busted

By Courtney Payne
Staff Reporter

The dismissal of Lexington Po-
lice Officer Fred Smith was the top-
ic of remarks made by a concerned
group of citizens at last 'I‘hursday’s
city council meeting.

Huey Johnson, a spokesman for
the citizens, asked the council to
explain the cause for the “quiet and
rushed” Sept. 8 dismissal. Johnson
also asked the council if a formal
hearing had occurred and if the pro-
per procedures had been followed in
the case.

Mayor H.E. “Buddy“ Derrick
said that out of consideration for the
individual concerned, “intemal prob-
lems” involving city employees
were best handled “outside of the

press.” He told the group that
Smith, represented by counsel, was

. following the established grievance

procedure for city employees.

“I have assured myself that the
proper procedures are being fol-
lowed by the city,” Derrick said.

The mayor said the proceedings
will not be public because they in-
volvc it confidential personnel mat-
tcr, although he said Smith is free
at any time to make statements re-
garding the case.

Smith can take the matter to the
city manager or to an arbitration
pmtel of his fellow officers, Derrick
said. According to City Manager
Joseph King, if he wins the case,
Smith will retain his job with no
punitive measures.

Smith filed his

appeal on

T tiestluy. As an option, Smith chose
to go before a three-man committee
of his peers to plead his case. The
committee has not yet been chosen.
Smith said his dismissal was not
job related and occured while he
was off duty, and at another local.

Councilman A.C. “Sonny" Jordan
said he was displeased by the “se-
crecy” of the proceedings and the
fact that he was not notified of
Smith's dismissal.

_‘‘I feel stupid when someone asks
me about something in my city and
I don't know about it,” he said.

Smith has been on the police
force since 1982 and is a member
of the Buena Vista school board.
His dismissal came as a result of a
dispute that took place while he was
off-duty in another locality.

 

 
 

  OPINION

 

New priorities
in Hugo’s wake

Sherman bypassed Charleston, South Carolina.

Hurricane Hugo didn’t.

The storm has left the headlines and nightly newscasts,
but the destruction it caused, like that visited upon the
South by Union forces in the Civil War, will not soon be
forgotten.

The Associated Press has reported damage estimates in
excess of $3 billion, but a dollar figure is difficult to
reach, difficult to grasp and cannot possibly take into
account the massive problems faced by those whose
homes are — or perhaps were — in Hugo's path.

Most Washington and Lee students saw only a glimpse
of the storm’s fury, in the form of the relatively minor
storm that moved through Lexington Friday. We saw the
destruction of Hugo only indirectly, through newspaper
pictures and stories and television reports.

But that is not true for all of us. For some, the effects
of the hurricane were far too immediate. Senior Mary
Hipp returned home to ﬁnd that, except for some ﬂoor
boards, every piece of the apartment behind her Pawley’s
Island home was gone. And freshman Alison Schwab of
Summerville said a tree crashed through the roof over her
family's garage, bringing heavy rains with it.

Freshman Ben Weinstein left Saturday to return to his
home near Myrtle Beach, fearing the worst. What he
found was water damage to his basement, while some of
his neighbors lost their homes entirely.

Sophomore Chisolm Coleman, a Charleston native, said
his parents and home escaped from Hugo undamaged. But
even the lucky ones faced a seemingly insurmountable list
of challenges. Some could not return home for days, kept
away because bridges no longer existed, or because fallen
power lines did. The storm’s victims waited days — many
‘_ will wait weeks —- for an end to curfews, power outages,
. and food, gasoline and water shortages. They have lived
- in fear of, and many have witnessed, looting, riots, price
‘ gouging and fights. They must remove the remains of
‘’ trees that had stood for decades and clean up all the
‘ other evidence of Hugo's march through the South.

Manv here in Lexington were also Hugo’s victims.
Hipp, Weinstein, Coleman, Schwab and other W&L
students were forced to sit in fear, helplessly hoping the

. storm would spare relatives and friends, waiting, waiting,
waiting for word while phone lines were swamped by
* callers, wind and water. I
,3’ It is so easy to see hurricane damage on television and
'. yet fail to grasp the magnitude of the devastation. Figures
' in the newspaper, such as 960,000 people without
-' electricity, 52 deaths and $3 billion in damage, mean
: almost nothing, perhaps because such reports are so
frequent. But this time, the consequences were more
. immediate. This time, friends’ lives and homes were
— behind those numbers.
It is in such times when W&L is called upon to live
. up to its claim of being a “community.” And, it‘ is in
i such times when we reorder our priorities, when we
' realize what is truly important, when the one thing many
‘I of us had been living for and focusing on for weeks —
. fraternity Rush — is seen in the proper light. V
On this week’s front page, we report “The Snag.” It
‘is ironic and perhaps hypocritical that we question the
{amount of time, money and sweat that goes into Rush
and yet give it front-page treatment. But our news
judgement is based to a large extent on what you, our
'readers, want to know. Fraternity men are intensely
interested in the size of their pledge classes, particularly
“how they did” in comparison to other fraternities. And
so we answer that question. But, at the same time, we
‘are, in a way, thankful for the reminder that Hugo
jprovided us of what is really important.

sVVhoops!

. We goofed. Last week’s article by Jon Sbar was out
.- of order. We put column two where column three was
:supposed to go, and column two where we meant to put
column three. Our apologies to Sbar, and to our readers.

Shedding light on being black

MY VIEW
By Joei Llyne Dyes

I am writing this article in an attempt to shed
some light on a very complicated issue. It seems
last week's Ring-tum Phi ran several articles and
letters which dealt specifically with racism, and
all of them, in my opinion, missed the bull's eye
of the target.

Although I am black, I do not pretend to
know how all people of our race feel and think,
as many other blacks (and whites) have the au-
dacity to do. In fact, I try to avoid discussing
racism because doing so seems to alienate my
caucasian friends and peers and makes me more
self-conscious. I believe it reminds both my
friends and I that, although we do care for each
other, we are different and can never really iden-
tify with one another.

It wasn't until I moved temporarily from Illi-
nois to Mississippi several years ago that I real-
ized just how different I was. In Houston, Miss.,
the small town to which I moved, it seemed
blacks and whites were as far apart as the North
and South Poles, in spite of the fact that one
could find the other just down the road.

Whilel was growing up in Illinois, .I lived in
a predominantly white neighborhood and was one
of six blacks in an elementary school of about
600 students. I truly felt I belonged. Even though
children do notice differences between themselves
and others, they do not seem to classify the vari-
ances as “good" or_ “bad" —— they simply accept
the fact that so-and-so is different. Racism must
be taught to children.

Unforttmately, I carried my naivete with me
into adolescence and into Houston and because of
it, I was abused. It was not the white children
who harassed - I knew they called me “nigger"
behind my back, and even to my face. But that
didn't bother me too much. You see, I knew a
few delicately selected expressions of my own,
most of which consisted of five to twenty-five
letters.

Ironically, the most hostile abuse came from
the blacks. That's when I truly realized we
weren't all alike. In opinions of other students, I
was all wrong. I didn't talk right — I talked

white. l didn't act right — I acted white. I even
liked white people.

“Girl, don't you know, they'll never think of
you as an equal," they told me. “Just ‘cause you
talk white and act white and hang around white
folks, that doesn't mean you're gonna be white.
Girl, need one of your vanilla friends, need them
for anything and see if they'll be there," they
said. “You'll see, one day your booty will be up
a tree, and all your buddies will just walk by,
leaving you hangin'. Then maybe you'll get your
butt back over on the side you belong!”

Well, much to their dismay, whenever my
booty was up a tree, my friends did help me. If
I needed a ride or missed a class and had to copy
notes or whatever, they would help me just as I
would help them. I always thought those kids
who called me naive were really dense, and I told
them so. Now I wish I could tell them I finally
understand why they felt the way they did.

We, black people, have heard all our lives that
white is right. I never heard such an outrageous
statement from my parents. My father, a former
black history teacher, would die before he'd say
such a thing. But, through society, we are fed a
negative self-irnage. We are constantly told that
whites are elite, and in order to rise to a re-
spected position in society, we should emulate
them. V

The media plays a key role in all this. Today,
the number of programs offered on television
featuring blacksiin estimable roles may be counted
on one's hand. I think blacks watch as much
television as whites, if not more. Why should they
not be able to see positive role models other than
Bill Cosby? In advertisements, beautiful black
models do not appear nearly as much as they
should. It's as if companies think the only prod-
ucts I purchase are Big Macs and Afro Sheen.
As I have said again and again, my money is
green just as anyone else's, and I have sense
enough to move to another product when I'm not
satisfied.

I am not comforted by the advantages we, as
children of those who marched and fought in the
Civil Rights Movement, now beneﬁt from. It
only saddens me when I think 30 years from now
my children will still have to wade through the
same manure I must trample through today. It's
been about 30 years since the Movement and the

Lastedﬂonal
misses point

I really enjoyed the editorial you wrote, but
(there is always a but) I drink you miss the
point by a few thousand yards, as well as giv-
ing misleading information.

First of all it would oe great if we lived in
a world without labels, but since the dawn of
man labels have been used for identiﬁcation.
Better yet, it would be great if we could erase
the stereotypes associated with labels. On s=..;h
stereotype that should be eliminated is minor-
ity=black.

The Dean of Minority and International
Affairs deals with all matters concerning Mi-
nority and International students, which in-
cludes everything except white Anglo-Saxon
males. The Dean is not just a Black Dean,
even though she is black, but a Dean for all
minorities. You said that “the university's
attempts may only be augmenting any prob-
lems," but its success shows that all minoriy
students have been integrating better these last
four years than any previous years.

You said “that the university continues to
segregate students, in spirit [whatever in spirit
means], at least, far beyond any social or cul-
tural necessity" through:

1. Minority recruitment — Would you as a
non—minority student ever think about going to
Howard University, Rikko University, Moscow
State University, or any other pre-dominantly
minority school without being approached by a
recruiter or someone who could raise your
interests about the school?

2. Minority counseling — Could you live
in one of these environments with no support
network that could identify with any concerns
or problems that might arise?

3. Minority Orientation — Would you like

same prejudice that loomed over my mother's
head, still hovers over mine.

A fellow student commented that whenever a
black person is involved in a crime, you'll see the
headline screaming across the front page. When a
black person does something good, it tends to be
covered up, swept over or not mentioned at all.

There's so much about the black man's past
that we should teach ourselves — aside from the
Civil Rights Movement, black art and literature —
to wipe out the senseless racism, to armihilate the
black man's hatred of himself. Blacks did so
many wonderful, extraordinary things ir1 history,
which have contributed to society as a whole, not
just the black race, that have been ignored in
American classrooms. Some will argue that
blacks are a minority, as are Hispanics and East
Asians, and the school systems do not have time
to dwell on anything but our country's history and
civics. However, I'll retort that the history of our
country, as it is being taught, both quietly and
blatantly reinforces negative myths about our race,
and no one is taking the necessary pains to dispel
those myths.

I'm a junior this year, double majoring in
English and journalism. I work as hard as any-
body else and do the same work. I believe I real-
ly got a taste of my future this summer when I
interned at the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal
in Tupelo. I begged for the opportunity to write
stories. I had just completed an advanced report-
ing class that spring. I really believed I was
ready to write copy. They wouldn't give me a
story. “Become familiar with the other reporters.
Doodle on the computers. Relax," they said. I
was cool. I tltought,okay, as long as you pay
me, everytl1ing’s fine. But I'm going to do my
story. And I did. I went out and got it. My
first story made the front page. They were aston-
ished. You can write, they said.

You can't hear, I said. I told you I could.

I try not to assume things. You and I both
know that this country is not lacking for bigots. It
does help to try to remain open-minded, don't
you think? I believe I was open-minded about
why the editors hesitated to let me write a story.
In the back of my mind, I know because I'm
black, many people will see my color as a strike
against me. Many, who have decided to believe

to be thrown in with the students from the
above schools without any kind of opportunity
to learn about the different language, cultures,
etc.? By the way, our Pre-orientation program
consists of a cross section of the incoming
students: 1/3 white, l/3 international, 1/3 black.
It is obvious that we are experiencing changes
which are, we hope, for the better.

A diverse student population is part of this
change. Each year we bring together approxi-
mately thirty six entering students who form a
culturally diverse group. This group, in the
past, has been a great help in encouraging an
appreciation of cultural diversity among the
entire student body.

There are many factors to consider when
we talk about diversity — such things as one's
gender, ethnicity, international status, high
school size, and residential area or region of
the United States come to mind immediately.
Students are selected for any one or more of
these reasons.

4. Minority job opportunities — Granted
affirmative action has many problems Mr.
Patterson, what organization doesn't, but until
anyone of any race or gender, with the capabil-
ity, can compete for a job knowing that the
only thing that may bar their way is not hav-
ing the best qualiﬁcations, there needs to be
something to protect people from job discrimi-
nation.

5. Minority newsletter — I hope you mean
Una Vox, “Un_a Vox translates into English as
‘one voice’ and is as close as Latin would
allow us to come to ‘unity,’ the concept that
motivated the development of this newsletter,"
says Everett E. Hamilton, Jr., the newsletter's
fust editor. “It is very easy, even on a carn-
pus as small as [W&L], for news and activities
that reflect cultural and ethnic diversity to be
overlooked. Una Vox has committed its pages
to accentuating the positive aspects of universi-
ty life and the contributions of its diverse pop-
ulation in promoting cultural understanding and
harmony."

Your final note of “wisdom” was to be
“aware.” This tantalizing tidbit of rational

thinking was the pinnacle_of your proverbial’
piece, but I thinketh that thou doeth need to

practice what you preach and research (be
aware”) before you speak.

tional Affairs

Atthe Pit,  
please tip

This letter is addressed to the patrons of the
GHQ (alias the Pit). The Pit is a restaurant.
Many of the people who work there are waiters
and waitresses. In a restaurant, when the service
is adequate, one generally leaves a tip. It is
considered rude not to do so. Because of social
convention, waiters and waitreses are paid less
than most other restaurant workers. On behalf
of the waiters and waitresses of the Pit I'd like,
to thank those of you who do tip. The profes-

sors and law students are especially conscien-.

tious. Unless you’ve waited tables, you have no‘
idea how frustrating it is to wait on people, get
them their food in record time, take care of all
their special requests - "Another drink? Sure,
no problem!" - only to find nothing on the table
but a mess. It’s easy to forget once in a while.
It's a casual place and we've all got a lot on
our minds, but those of you who consistently
don't tip are just plain rude. We work hard to
get you your food quickly, we bus our own
tables, and we clean the place after closing. A
little consideration would be appreciated and
even (or is this asking too" much?) a little pa-
tience when we're packed or understaffed. Once
again I’d like to thank those of you who do tip.
Whether in cash or points — it's much appreci-
ated.

Sincerely ,
Irritated Pit-workers

save the

MY VIEW
By D. Ross Patterson

“Save your Confederate money
boys, the South is gonna rise again,"
proclaims one bumper sticker, while
another says, “American by birth,
Southern by the Grace of God." A
third says, “Keep the South
beautiful, put a Yankee on a bus.”
Bumper stickers are not merely one
of the myriad of products peddled by
Stuck_ey’s and truck stops. Rather,
they are a reflection of public
opinion at a basic level.

The three bumper stickers referred
to above reflect the feeling of many
Southerners, a sense of pride
stemming from a feeling that the
South is somehow fundamentally
different from the rest of the United
States; that there is a quality which
sets it apart. Despite the War
Between The States, the wanton

destruction reeked by General
Sherman's infamous. “March to the
Sea,” and the devastating

“Reconstruction" which followed the
War, the unique traditions, ideals,
and spirit of the Old South remain -
Southem heritage has survived.
However, the preservation of
Southern traditions has been decried
by those who, mistakenly, believe
that a reverence and respect for
Southern heritage is an endorsement
of slavery. Those persons who take
exception to the preservation of
Southem traditions apparently believe
that slavery and the Old South are

 

intertwined, inseparable institutions.
However, this is not the case. It is
possible to revere one while
abhorring the other.

This confusion is not limited to
Northemers who do not understand
the unique affection with which
Southemers regard the Old South. It
is becoming all too evident among
Southemers as well. There are many
examples of this new trend towards
de-Southemization. During the 1987

tradition

Democratic National‘ Convention, the
Mayor of Atlanta said, “We want to
be an American city first and a
Southem city second." For the first
time in recent years, The Citadel's
regimental and pipe bands did not
play Dixie at dress parade. Many
high schools have, because of court
orders, ceased displaying Confederate
flags at sporting events. There are
ongoing efforts to eliminate the
display of Confederate ﬂags over
state capitols. And, in an example
closer to home, there has been a
push in recent years to transform
Washington and Lee from a Southern
university with a national’ reputation
to a national university located in the
South. I find it" shocking that the
pride which was almost universal
among Southemers is so easily
eroded.

A great deal of the pressure
towards de-Southemization seems to
come from a desire in this “more
enlightened" age to distance
ourselves from the racism which is
so often associated with the
traditional South. No one but the
most ignorant bigot wishes for a
return to the days of racial
segregation. Instead, those who wish
to retain the unique attributes of the
South wish to preserve the heritage
of great men such as Robert Edward
Lee, and the values and traditions
they embodied.

America is too young a country
to have the appreciation of history
which members of older societies
develop. Consequently, America is
still developing its national character
and emphasizes a process of change
and forward motion rather than the
preservation of older values and
culture. However, the unique qualities
of the gentile Old South are well
worth preserving. The trend towards
de-Southemization reflects a
perception that the South is somehow
lacking and must change. This is a

perception we ought not have, and to "

which we should not respond. The
South shall rise again! Let us not
abandon it.

Peer counseling

available

By Ben Worth
Staff Reporter

Peer counseling, now beginning
its third year, offers students an alter-
native counseling resource.

Dr. James Worth, University
Counseling Psychologist, outlined the
structure of the_Peer Counseling pro-
gram. Begun in January of 1987, the
program offers an alternative to
professional counselors and friends by
training fellow students to be listeners
and problem-solvers.

Counselors are selected for the
program for their ability to relate to
other students, sense of fairness,
common sense and personal warmth,
and similar criteria.

At the beginning of the school
year, and throughout the year, peer
counselors participate in training
programs designed to sharpen listening
skills, problem recognition, problem
solving and referral skills.

Peer counselors can meet with
students in one of two ways - either
by a face-to-face counseling session,
made by calling the peer counselor at

for all

home, or by calling the peer counsel-
ing hotline.

Students calling the hotline will
find counselors who are prepared to
talk about drugs, alcohol, problem
pregnancies sexually transmitted dis-
eases and other problems.

Worth was quick to emphasize the
conﬁdential nature of the program.
All contacts with students are confi-
dential, including other students, other
peer counselors and the faculty and
staff.

Worth said he was excited about
getting the new year under way,
referring to the students in the pro-
gram as “super people,” and praising
their excellence by noting that all of
last years’ peer counselors who ap-
plied, received positions as dorm
counselors, or resident advisors.

The peer counselor hotline is open
Sunday through Thursday from 8:00
pm. to 11:00 p.m., and Friday and
Saturday from 9:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m.
The phone number is 463-8999. A
list of peer counselors and their phone
numbers can be obtained from Dr.
Worth’s office in the University Cen-
ter.

Freshman finds faults with Rush 

MY VIEW
By Richard Hill

Rush, 1989. It's plastered on tee-
shirts and posters all over campus.
It is a time of confusion. it is a time
-of hell.

I believe that some fundamental
changes need to be made to the Rush
system in order for it to function
properly. I went‘-through all of Rush
and eventually tore, but I must
concede that there are some serious
flaws in the system.

For starters, it should be possible
to go to all 16 fraternities if you
want to. Rush should be informal;
decentralized, I suppose. And let's
eliminate the twenty dollar rush fee.

The booklets that we are supplied, do
not, in my mind, constitute the
justification for charging such an
outrageous sum of money. Or, does
the IFC need extra funds in order to
police the fraternities?

Individuals should be given the
opportunity to visit any of the
fraternities that they want. At the
same time, Open Houses and casual
contact should spread out over two
or three weeks, as opposed to only
one. This allows everyone the chance
to meet all of the brothers in a large
house. Then. the fraternities would
make up a list of the people that
they would like to see back. Each
individual would then be given a list
of the fraternities that have asked
them back. Not until then would they
choose the six that they would like

to visit. Then the Rush Dates would
be scheduled and the rest would be
up to the individual fraternities.

The point is that, with very few
exceptions, there is a fraternity at
W&L for everyone. It should be
easier and more efficient for the
individuals to find which one that
may be.

The idea of my system, is to
have it so that Rush is done in a
way that the individual rushees have
more control over where they go and
when they go.

The major problem is the time. I
moved into W&L on a Saturday.
After a week of orientation (that
period were freshmen go from
confused to totally confused), Rush

started. A week later we were in the
middle of Rush Dates. Finally, lasi
weekend, we tore. I haven’t ever;
organized my room yet, nor have I
even began to get a handle on the
academic scene. Yet, I have been
briskly marched through a process
that has yielded the most important
decision that I will have to make as
a freshman. .It is the one decision
that is going to affect me for the
next four years. :

Unless Rush is restructured in,
such a way that more exposure to_
more houses is possible, and until’
there is more time, Rush is going tq
be" a large cold bowl of soggy mush;
And for that matter, it is just one_
large bowl, in what (for freshmen at_
least) is sure to be hundreds more.

the myths, will not think I am as capable of com-‘
pleting an assignment as my caucasian counter-
parts. But, I know I cannot realize my dreams if
I allow that knowledge to become a burden.

I decided to believe I wasn't being allowed to
do a story because I was just a wet-behind-the-
ears college kid whom they felt didn't know all
she needed to know about writing copy. I main-
tained this presumption until the last week when a
member of the powers-that-be approached me and
said, “You know, Joei, when we hired you we

were just going to" let you sharpenpencils and‘

fetch coffee. Just look how your work has en-
hanced our paper.” He leaned close and said.
“You should be proud. You're an exception.
You're not like them." He nodded toward a back
room, referring to the blacks working the loading
docks and running the presses. I politely informed
him that their original plan would not have been
successful as I’ve never been inclined to perform
menial tasks. However, I did not inquire about
what I was supposedly an exception to — I knew
what he was talking about.

He meant, I believe, because of the color of
my skin, ‘I wasn't supposed to have sense enough
to construct a decent news story, and certainly not
good copy. Good heavens! Because I could de-
liver. Pllrhaps he wondered if I was really black
at all. Maybe he thought I was a caucasian in
disguise. (For a moment. I must confess, I was
tempted to reveal to him the other end of my
person and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
that I really was black after all. But, I refrained.)

I learned a long time ago to stop letting insen-
sitive people's attitudes disrupt my life. Although
I no longer cry about racism, I’ve been unable to
reduce the level of anger I feel when narrow-
minded, egotistical people carelessly toss their
viewpoints ‘into my lap. I must speak out, or
explode. .-

In addressing a few issues presented in last
week's paper, I will first deal with Professor
Futch’s facetious apology. I’ve read the thing
about twenty times now, trying to make sense of
it's ‘latter half. Maybe some of you understand

exactly what he meant by, “In today's America
the public display of certain symbols and

emblems is completely out of the question. Every-
one must understand this." I had to keep asking
myself why he said that at all, as a simple apolo-
gy would have sufficed. It is my interpretation
that Professor Futch is saying what one could get
away with 20 years ago, one cannot get away
with now. The Negroes now have a voice. He
cannot pose with porch monkeys in today's soci-
ety_ and expectjthe "coloreds" to _sit idly by,
closed-mouthed, dumb like the statue on the
porch. His “apology” seemed only to express
remorse for having the privilege of calling the
Negroes "niggers" revoked.

By the way, I didn’t even know what a porch
monkey was. I had to ask my father, thus ex-
plaining to him the entire situation behind my
inquiry. Needless to say, he was not pleased. »

My grandmother only completed the sixth
grade, but she was one of the most intelligent
women I'll ever have known. She summed it up
best when she~said, “Child, I don't care how

much education a man has, he can be a lawyer, a

doctor or‘ the finest teacher, but if he doesn't
know how ‘to treat others, all his education really
doesn't do'~him.‘-a lick"of good.” I believe the
term she favored was “educated fool."

As for Mr. Patterson's letter about the trees
and shrubbery, in which he refers to Michigan
State University's affirmattive action policy, I must
say, I think both he and Ms. MacDoi:'ild ﬂew
over the “forest" in question. Mr. Patterson is
upset .tl1at ‘fdeserving non-minority students are
denied a place in the school of their choice"
because, he said, undeserving minorities are given
a boost. They are admitted because of their color.
It's a valid argument. And, to art extent, I cer-
tainly agree with him. Powever, Mr. Patterson
fails to take in to account thc..numbers of intelli-
gent minority students‘, forced .to, attend rim-down,
irmer-city schools that Ilie government knows are
not up to par. In many cases, these students are
certainly not exposed to the‘. things that upper-'
class suburban children are learning. Although the

minority parents pay taxes like every other parentﬁi
their children aren't necessarily treated the same.
It’s not a fair society, Mr. Patterson. That's the
whole problem. It's unfortunate that when we try}
to make things right, there will inevitably be?
holes in the blueprints. We must, however, keep?
Finally, the editors‘ "Opinion" in last week's;
newspaper is inaccurate. The pre-orientation of—§
fered every year is not for minority students spe-j
cifically. I talked with Dean McCloud about this,I
and she said the purpose of the pre-orientation is:
to bring together students from diverse back—I
grounds, geographical regions and social '
settings. She said the university brings these
students together hoping that they'll benefit fromi
their experience in that week and in some way’.
share it with the rest of the student body. This;
year, she said, the pre-orientation seemed to be?
divided into thirds: international, minority andi
caucasian students. When I read the editorial, I;
must admit I was confused, because my fellow‘.
junior, Sandy Dudley, sat next L) me during the’
pre-orientation my freshman year, and if the thing .
was really supposed to be for minorities only, 11
knew somebody messed up. ’

In closing, I would like to say I take full.‘
responsibility for these opinions. They're mine '.
alone. Like many others who've searched, I have I
no answer for racism. I do realize, however, be- I
fore society's situation can really improve, the 1
hatred must be removed from all of our hearts. 2

I am a black woman and proud of it.'I am not :
looking for a handout from anybody. I believe the 1
good Lord will see me through just like He will I
everyone else. I am here at Washington and Lee I
because'I belong. I graduated eighth in my class I
from a very respected, very competitive high 2
school in Illinois. I -was the first black to graduate i
in the top ten at that institution. I look forward to i
a bright future (post W&L) in spite of racism. I I
have so much to offer and have every intention of i
reaching my goals. I pity the racists who attempt I
to stand between me and my destiny.

Staff Reporter

Murray of W&L Security, “Some
days two to three cars are towed,
some days none at all." Cars are
most commonly towed for
“blocking the trash bins outside of
Gaines, parking by yellow lines,
parking in restricted zones — like by
the wheelchairs — and parking in
visitor parking.

-There were no records of how
many W&L students’ cars they tow,
but _John Bunlap_ of the Lexington
Towing Service said, “On average,
we tow 13-14 cars a day, including
wrecks and breakdowns."

Several students have had their
cars towed from the Corral. Junior
Brooke Tinley’s car was towed after

This spring’s graduating seniors ‘
will receive the traditional sheepskin 3
diploma, despite rurriors «that W&L
is converting to the less expensive «
paper diploma.

“It’s the same rumor every

“I think scniors start it as a joke,
claiming their class will be the last “

A common sight is an irate
student whose car has recently been

what its like. She had her car towed
from outside the University
Center.“It was stupid — it was late
in the day and I wasn't thinking. It
was a big pain and it was a hassle
because I'm injured. I think it’s

“The security guy said that we
have to work it out with all of the
other students where they're going
to park their cars. Now, they've
painted yellow lines there," she
said.

Tinley was also frustrated with
the towing service’s inconvenient
location. “It’s impossible to find
where they towed your car on those
winding country roads. If they are
going to tow it, they may as well

Sliocpskin diplomas were first
used for diplomas when paper was
of poor quality, but now they are t
virtually out of use. W&L is one
of about eight institutions which still
issue them on sheepskin. Virginia 0
Military lnstitute is included in this
small group.

The shccpskins are ordered from A

OFITS

The Fling-tum Phl, September 28, 1989

 

 

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

v Last Saturday, the Washington
and Lee Generals played host to a
tdugh Centre College football team.
Going into the game, Generals head
coach Gary Fallon knew his team
would “have their hands tilled.”

‘ And they did.

In an evenly matched game, both
the Generals and the Colonels found
scoring opportunities hard to come
by in the ﬁrst half.

1 Although Centre kept the W&L
defense on the ﬁeld for what
séemed like an eternity in the first
half, the Colonels were able to
manage only a shaky 34-yard ﬁeld
Dal on the last play of the half by
‘avid Harr to lead 3-0.

While: the W&L defense -was
keeping Centre’s offense in check,
ﬁe Colonels’ defense was returning
'e favor to the Generals’ offense.
A.t halftime, the Generals had
crossed midﬁeld only once, with
trial drive ending in one of junior
Mason Pope's seven punts on the
day.

‘ Keeping the Generals offense in
check was something that neither of

&L's first two opponents could
do. In games against Emory and
H'enry and Methodist, the Generals
put up 72 points (25 and 47,
respectively) while ﬂying high on
tlhe arm of senior quarterback Phillip

Sampson. In the two games,
Sitmpson put up All-American
numbers, throwing for over 470

yards and six touchdowns.
4 Centre’s defense was not in awe,

     

§__they double-covered each of the
Generals’ outside receivers, juniors
Craig Irons and Carl Gilbert, which
allowed the defensive line, led by
end Gary Fields, to get into the
backﬁeld and sack the Generals’
signal—caller nine times on the day.
Said Fallon, “Centre was a very
good football team. They were
quick and aggressive. Their
secondary was very good. A lot of
our problems offensively were due
to what Centre was doing
defensively. We had trouble
blocking one of their defensive ends
and they had good coverage.”
Despite being under constant
pressure, Sampson still completed
12 out of the 22 passes he
attempted for a respectable 92 yards.
While Centre was keeping Air-
Sampson on the muddy surface of
Wilson ﬁeld, Colonels’ tailback Tim
McDaniel was having a career day.
McDaniel ran through the Generals
defense for a career-high 202 yards
and the lone touchdown of the day
as Centre stopped W&L 10-0.
McDaniel was able to get most
of his yards running sweeps behind
two pulling guards and, a host of
other blockers, and making the first

potential tackler miss. On the
Colonels’ touchdown drive,
McDaniel carried the ball eight

times for 59 of the 74 yards,
including a 33-yard romp off the
right side that put the Colonels
inside the Generals’ 20-yard line.
That was the only time Centre
was able to put a real dent in a
W&L defensive unit that hung
tough and made big plays all

afternoon long. The secondary of
seniors Brad Miller (an
interception), Bobby Rimmer, Bland
Warren and junior Clark Wight,
along with sophomore Fred
Renneker kept Centre quarterback
Kelly Sandidge from sustaining a
passing attack with ﬁne coverage.
Sandidge completed just ﬁve of 19
attempts on the afternoon.

The unit combined for 27 tackles
on the day. The line, led by seniors

Dave Radulovic and Scott
Silverrnan. junior Carter Quayle and
sophomore John McCallum

combined for 28 tackles and two
sacks. Linebackers Mike Pack and
Trey Cox were the backbones of the
defense. Pack, a senior tri-captain,
was in on 17 tackles and broke up
two passes. Counterpart Cox, a
sophomore, was in on 10 tackles
and recovered a fumble.

“We were in the ball game
thanks to our defense. Our defense
did a good job. They hung in there
and got some turnovers and caused
some timely penalties that helped
keep them off the scoreboard,” said
Fallon.

When the offense stalled, Pope
kicked the Generals out of .a hole,
getting off punts of 42, 41, 34, 46,
and 61 yards among his seven, the
last into a wind, for an average of

41.5 yards. Pope also led the
Generals ground attack with 41
yards on 10 carries.

Offensively, Irons had another

ﬁne afternoon, xmaking five
receptions, almost all of them of the
diving variety, for 50 yards.

The Washington and Lee men's
soccer team split a pair of games
this week, losing a road game at
North Carolina-Wesleyan on Sunday
4-2 and beating Shenandoah
yesterday at Liberty Hall Field 3-0.

Before travelling to North
Carolina for Sunday's game, head
coach Rolf Piranian said that
Wesleyan, at 6-2 on the season,
would be one of the strongest teams
the Generals would face all season.

The Bishops indeed proved to be
tough as they jumped out to a 2-0
lead in the ﬁrst half. Their ﬁrst goal
came on a penalty kick resulting
from a disputed hand-ball call.

Wesleyan scored again before
freshman Mike Mitchem dished the
ball off from the top of the penalty
box to sophomore Winthrop Allen,
who one-touched it to the left side
of the net for his first collegiate
goal.

The Generals tied the game at 2-
2 early in the second half when
Mitchem gathered the ball at the top
of the penalty box, turned, and
drilled it into the lower left comer
for his ﬁrst career goal.

The Bishops recaptured the lead
when they scored the eventual game
winner on a goal that was assisted
by a throw-in. They added another
goal after the Generals miscleared
the ball up the middle of the
backﬁeld.

Sophomore goalie Lee Corbin
started the game, collecting three

bless them, they caught some
passes, but they paid for them too.”
“We never got untracked
offensively. We would do something
nice and then we’d hurt ourselves
with maybe a penalty or allowing
ourselves to be sacked. We just
never really found it throughout the
whole game. Our defense hung in
there as long as it could,” said
Fallon. '
Next, the 1-2 Generals will take
on Randolph-Macon at Ashland in a
game that historically comes down
to the last minutes. The home team
has not won in the series since

1982. The Generals, playing at
home last year, tied the Yellow
Jackets 10-10. Two years ago, in
Ashland, the Generals prevailed 35-
28. Sampson threw for over 230
yards and had two touchdowns, and
Carl Gilbert returned a kickoff 80
yards for another score. Game time
is 1:30. WLUR-FM 91.5 and
WREL-AM 1450 will carry the
game live on the Washington and

Yes, there were moves made in the athletic department over the sum-
mer. Yes, athletic director William McHenry resigned. Yes, head lacrosse
coach Dennis Daly was reassigned to a new post within the department.

So what has been done to fill these voids? We are a month into the
athletic year, and Washington and Lee University is without a ‘full-time
athletic director and without a lacrosse coach. When will this situation be
rectified? One problem will solve the other once an athletic director is
named. University president John D. Wilson has said that the naming of a
new lacrosse coach will be the first act of the new athletic director.

This brings up a couple of questions. How far along is the search
committee for the athletic director? and, once the new AD is named, ho
long will it take to name the new coach? '

tee has set Nov. 1 as
the date on which the
new athletic director
will be named. Since

Richard Miller has
said that the starting
date in the spring,
usually Feb. 1, will

unlikely that he will leave the school after the fall season, which most
schools have, to start anew at a different school.

One more problem with waiting so long to name the new men in the
athletic department — the future. You have to have a coach to do the
recruiting, and just how many players are going to come to play for a
program without a coach. Picture this: a prospective student/lacrosse player
is up for his campus interview. He is walking around campus with a few
of the lacrosse players. One of the topics of conversation is the lacrosse
program. The prospective asks the players how the coach is, and the
players shamefully answer, “Well, we don’t have a coach right now, and
we’d like to know how he is as well." Chances are, no matter how
beautiful the campus is, we just lost a possible all-America lacrosse

The formula is simple: poor recruiting = a sparse future. Recruiting is

The Washington and Lee water
polo team, emerging last week as
the only undefeated water polo team
in the nation, continued its steady
ascent up the Eastern Regional
rankings by winning the Virginia
State Championships last weekend.

An educated guess by goalie
David Olson, and a scoring eruption
by standout defender Alan Herrick
keyed the Generals’ championship-
game win, a taut 12-9 triumph over
arch—rival Richmond. The win
propelled the Generals to the
seventhyplace in the Eastern Region
rankings. .

The Generals leveled Lynchburg
18-7 in their first game, and
humbled Hampden-Sydney 16-5 in
the second — the Generals’ third
win of the year over each team. The
wins set up the climactic clash with
the Spiders, whom W&L had
expected to play in the ﬁnals of last
week’s North Eastern Varsity
Invitational.

W&L head coach Page
Remillard had expressed reservations
early in the week about his team's
ability to counter some of the fine
individual talent Richmond relied

upon. He needn't have worried.

speciﬁcally tailored to trace career
trends and patterns throughout the
state. Changes have also been made
to the Discover computer, which has

smooth sailing.
tournament, the
team in the nation at 11-0. W&L file photo.

Three Generals made the all-State
team ~ Herrick, Jay Smith, and
Tomas Perez - combined to score

ten goals.
Said Herrick, “Last year I
concentrated solely on defense.

This year, everyone has to pull their
own weight, so I decided to go for
a few goals.”

Yeah, and John Tower decided
to go for a few drinks.

Herrick tallied five goals, a
career high, and even prompted the
Richmond coach to wonder, “Alan
Herrick, where’d he come from?"
Too late coach — the knockout blow
had already come.

No less a factor was a
memorable save by Olson. It came
in the third quarter with W&L
ahead 6-5 when Richmond was
awarded a penalty shot: a shooter
alone with the goalie. Penalty shots
are like the ending to a Mike Tyson

fight - almost a foregone
conclusion.

But Olson had noticed something
previously that would spoil the
ending for Richmond. “I’d seen

[the Richmond shooter] take a few
penalty shots earlier in the
tournament and every time he'd

taken a skip shot to the goalie’s
left,” he said, “I guessed he’d do it
again.”

the Career Connections program will
be expanded to more cities this
year. Career Connections is an off-
campus job search program that
works through alumni networks in
order to find W&L students summer
internships as well as permanent
jobs. Last spring the first of these
meetings took place in New York
City. W&L students wishing to
work in New York were matched
with W&L alumni according to in-
terests and job fields. This fall and
winter, Career Connections will hold
conferences in New York City,
Washington, D.C., San Francisco
and Los Angeles. Due to the loyalty

and support W&L alumni have
shown for this institution, Dean
Heatley is particularly optimistic

about expanding the Career and De-
velopment Office through the alumni
ranks.

After winning the Virginia State
Generals are the only undefeated

Said Remillard, “His [overall]
play was instrumental in keeping us
in a position where we could
concentrate on offense. The players
have a lot of confidence in him
back there.”

Instead of being tied at 6—all as
they had counted on, Richmond
found themselves still trying to get
even. Although the Generals were
tied later in the quarter, they took a
8-7 lead into the fourth quarter that
they never relinquished. Said W&L
co-captain Shawn Copeland, “This
was our best weekend of playing.
We played together, and it’s always
nice to beat Richmond."

Remillard had plenty of praise

to spread around. “Part of our
strength is balance. [If our
opponents] concentrate on one or

two guys, we have the athletes to
beat you. Our secondary defense
really helped. It stymied Richmond
when they tried to force Alan
Herrick out of the two meter [close
in] defense.”

The team has three weeks off
before its next tournament, where it
will face Eastern power Brown in
the first round. The break will
allow the Generals to return to a
“preseason atmosphere," according
to Remillard; stressing academics,
conditioning, and fundamentals.

The Washington and Lee crogs
country teams emerged from their
first meets with excellent times
in put themselves in good shape to
put together successful seasons. s

Women’s head coach Jim
Phemister was encouraged by tlfla
team’s performance against Mary
Washington College and Universit
of Richmond. '

“We ran very strongly against
both schools. Our finishing times
were markedly ahead of those at tltﬁz
same point  last year’s season,’.’
said Phemister.

W&L’s competition was
particularly formidable, considerin
that Richmond is a Division §
school, and Mary Washington,
Division III, has had a stranglehold
on first place in the South/Southeast
Conference in recent years. ,,

Junior Cecily Tynan ran an
especially impressive race finishing
with the best 5-km time in the
ODAC at 20:55. Tynan’s time was
also a personal best for the ct!-
captain. Phemister said that Tynan’§
result “reflects her determination
and dedicated training.” *

“I was very pleased with

includes six runs per week and ea

By all means, read....

By Chris Swan
Staff Reviewer

The Hunt For Red October 
Red Storm Rising  “Patriot Games
A, The Cardinal In the Kremlin 
these are the works of one of

merica’s newest and greatest
writers, a superb storyteller with an
eye for detail. Since the publication
or Red October in 1984, Tom
Clancy has become one to the most
celebrated authors of this decade.
His intricate lcnowledge of ‘the
military seems to belong to either a
inilitary or an intelligence officer.
In fact, Tom Clancy is a former
‘insurance salesman who wrote Red
Qctober from painstaking research,
mostly of material in the public
domain, and a bold imagination. It
as rumored that this book earned
him a White House debriefing and a
private talk with the president.
a Each of Clancy’s subsequent
works has thrilled millions of
feaders worldwide. He has written
about the defection of a Soviet
submarine; a modern scenario of
World War III; ‘terrorism abroad and
at home and a Soviet double—agent
deep within the Kremlin. And, once
again, Clancy thrills his readers with
gs newest book, Clear and Present

anger.
A The flow of drugs into America
is one to today’s hottest and most
controversial issues. President
I

Ronald Reagan's war against drugs
unfortunately produced no concrete
results, as more illegal drugs that
ever poured over our borders in the
past two years. Reactions to this
have ranged from letting those drug
users who are the cause of this drug
import to go “ahead and kill
themselves to demands for tougher
anti-drug laws to cries for military
intervention in South America to
wipe out drugs at the source. Tom
Clancy has taken all of these views,
added in some of his favorite
characters like Jack Ryan from Red
October and other Clancy novels,
and produced an explosive novel of
espionage, intrigue and dirty
warfare.

Jack Ryan, the hero of Clancy’s
Red October, Patriot Games, and
The Cardinal of the Kremlin, is back
again as'a CIA analyst and the new
deputy director of intelligence,
discovering someone has decided to
take the flow of drugs into the U.S.
as a threat to national security.
American military units are secretly
deployed in Columbia to destroy the
drug trade at it’s source. Yet the
book dwells not only on these
actions but also the morality of
these events. When can a nation
treat criminal activity as a threat to
national security, and what steps
may that nation take? Clancy takes
the reader not only into the
headquarters of the CIA but also to
the board rooms of the Colombian

I:-lunan Garden: a B+

 

By Todd Peppers
‘Entertainment Columnist

’ V

Take a few seconds and ask
yourself the following questions:
Have you memorized the menu in
the GHQ? Do you visit the Co-op
so often that at night you hear
someone yelling “chicken ﬁlet with
cheese?” Is your desk buried with
the food service’s wooden riickels?
These are several symptoms of a
well-kriown disorder called “Sick of
Eating On Campus.” They usually
surface during the fourth week of
classes and fill Washington and Lee
students with a desire to eat any-
place that does not take “points or
cash.”

‘ If you are looking for a break
gofn campus, then Hunan Garden
estaurant may be the answer.
Hunan Garden is located in the
Rockbridge Square Shopping Mall
and can be easily missed since it is
hidden between McDonald's and
Schewel Furniture Company. I think
It is a restaurant worth finding for
',hose who want more than the ordi-
nary off-campus sandwich shop.
" Several friends and I have ven-
tured to the Hunan Garden three
‘times in the last ten days. My last
visit confirmed my belief that the
estaurant fills a void in the array of
restaurants in Lexington. The inte-
rior of the building itself is quite
nicely done. The restaurant is not
divided up into little cubicles, but is
completely open. You can sit at
your table, glance around, and see
who’s with whom. There are booths
glong the walls, but they do not ob-
scure one from looking around the
restaurant. One side of the restaur-
ant contains a fair-size bar that
oasts of a fairly inexpensive drink
list. There is a large television over
he bar that I found a bit distract-
ing. Who wants to watch “Jeopar-
lay” while eating wonton soup? The
j chairs around the free-standing ta-
les are corrifortable and the larger
cables have “lazy-susans” to help
‘ with the exchanging of dishes.
__ If you want to eat out but are
goncemed about spending a large
amount of money, the Hunan Gar-
Hen’s Sunday buffet is perfect. The
buffet is only $5.95 and customers
can eat egg rolls until they drop.
The contents of the buffet change
from week to week. The Sunday I
visited the restaurant offered egg
iblls, fried chicken wings, Kung Po
fhicken, Beef Lo Mein, Shrimp
with Green Peas, Fried Rice with
Shrimp, Sliced Beef Mixed with
Vegetables, and Sweet and Sour Tri-
ple Delight (Sweet and Sour Pork,

Beef, and Shrimp). The buffet also
offers clam chowder, fresh fruit, and
fortune cookies.

The buffet was quite good in
total, with a few glaring exceptions:
no steamed rice was present, the
clam chowder seemed completely
out of place, the Shrimp with Green
Peas was tasteless, and the Kung Po
Chicken was buried in green pep-
pers. Yet the other dishes were
good and the Triple Delight was
excellent. Considering the low'5price
and amount of food, the Sunday
buffet is worth the trip.

Keeping that in mind, I am
forced to say that I enjoyed my two
dinners at the Hunan Garden more
than the Sunday buffet. The dinner
menu gives the customer freedom in
selecting entrees and does not put
one at the mercy of the buffet. The
dishes my friends and I selected
during dinner established in my
mind that the Hunan Garden is a
fine restaurant. The one dish that I
loved was General Tso’s Chicken.
Found under House Specialties,
General Tso’s Chicken is a hot and
spicy dish that features large chunks
of boneless chicken covered with
the “chef’s special sauce” and
served with sauteed vegetables. It is
a dish you must try.

I also was impressed with the
Hunan Beef (another hot dish),
Sweet and Sour Pork, and the M00
Shu Pork. A warning is in order for
all uncoordinated people like myself
who order the M00 Shu Pork. It
requires a degree of assembly and
one must carefully place the M00
Shu Pork and plum sauce in a pan-
cake and fold the entire concoction
up. I cheated and had one of my
diner companions make one for me.

One of the most impressive as-
pects of Hunan Garden is the ser-
vice. When we were seated for
dinner, the entire restaurant was
filled. Our food arrived in around
eighteen minutes, yet our waitress
apologized twice for the delayll I
find that a refreshing change from
some local restaurants that take over
thirty minutes to make simple dishes
and really don't seem to care that
the customer is left fending off star-
vation. The waiters and waitresses
watch every detail. The second time
I ate dinner at Hunan Garden, my
waiter and I were locked in a con-
test as I repeatedly tried to empty

cartel, to the coast Guard ships in
the Gulf of Mexico, the agents of
the FBI who work on domestic drug
operations, and the covert-action
teams in the jungles of Colombia in

. an effort to view the problem from

every possible angle. The reader
finds both familiar characters and
new ones in this novel: Red
Wegener, the old Coast Guard
captain who must deal with the new
problem of drug’ runners; Dan
Murray, a senior FBI agent who
discovers an enormous money
laundering scheme connected to the
Cartel; Adm. James Greer, the dying
deputy director of intelligence for
the CIA, whose failing strength
guides Jack Ryan into his new
career; Sgt. Domingo Chavez, a
light infantry soldier who finds
himself involved in a dangerous
search-and-destroy mission; Juan
Cortez, the renegade Cuban
intelligence officer who sells his
talents to the Cartel; and a CIA
field officer, known only as “Mr.
Clark,” who has a lifetime of
experience and is Jack Ryan's only
real hope for discovering who, if
anyone, has broken the law with
these super-secret drug operations.
As each character has a specific
purpose in this novel, so does the
title. “Clear and present danger” is
a test of First Amendment rights
developed during World War I and
the accompanying ‘Red Scare.’

Holmes put the test forward in the
1920s in the case of Schenck v. U.S.
The government can abridge First
Amendment rights when freedom of
expression “create(s) a clear and
present danger."

Some people in this novel view
the drug trade as such a danger and
have taken steps to rectify what
they believe to be a threat to the
security of the U.S. There are no
hard and fast rules, however, to
define that substantive evil. Who
has the right to declare the drug
problem a threat to nation security,
Clancy asks in his latest.

Several early readers of Clancy
have complained that his writhing
is too stiff and focuses more on
modern technology than on the
human characters. It is true that Red
October was full of technical terms
and complicated hardware, as was
Red Storm Rising. Clancy’s Patriot
Games dealt with superbly with the
characters and not with gadgets,
showing Clancy’s developing skill
as a more personal writer. His love
for gadgets is clearly present (pun
intended) in this book, but his
characters are also ﬂeshed out and
carry emotions of their won that
will carry over to the reader. By all
means, read Clear and Present
Danger. Clancy’s portrayal of the
drug trade will make you sit up and
think.

my water glass before he refilled it.
I lost. This is just another facet of
Hunan Garden that places it above
several area restaurants.

My only complaint about the two
dinner experiences was the prices of
the entrees. I think that $9.50 for
General Tso's Chicken and $8.50
for Sweet and Sour Shrimp is a bit
excessive. Prices on several Appetiz-
ers were also a little more than I
cared to pay--either Fried or
Steamed Dumplings cost $3.50. I
realize that we are not in a larger
city where many Chinese restaurants
compete for the consumer’s dollar.
Yet I still think the prices are on
the high side for this market. Do
not be deceived by the lower prices
of the lunch menu. The prices are
almost three dol_lars less than the
dinner menu, but one waiter freely

admitted that the portions are small-
er. V

In the ﬁnal analysis of the
Hunan Garden, the small amount of
negative aspects are far over-sha-
dowed by the positive qualities.
How can you not like a restaurant
that gives you chopsticks with an
instruction manual? I fully rec-
ommend the restaurant to anyone
who is looking for a break from the
monotony of campus food. Not ev-
eryone falls in love with Chinese
food, but I think the Hunan Garden
will have something for even the
most discerning customer. Peppers
will give it an “A” for effort and a
“B” for content, final grade is a
“B+". If only some of my profes-
sors were as generous with my
grades.

Postmarks and Pleasures, a gift
shop located near the comer of Nel-
son and Lee streets, opened earlier
this month, offering a new assort-
ment of calendars, cards, party fa-
vors and scientific toys to the Lex-
ington community.

Postmarks is owned and man-
aged by Susan Harb, who is also
the owner of Caravans, a dress and
accessory shop located next door.
Harb decided to open Postmarks
after a quite successful summer with
Caravans, which opened in May.

“I was surprised at the amount
of visitors to Lexington this summer
that supported Caravans,” Harb
said. Despite the lack of students in
the summer, the store attracted
many townspeople and tourists, in-
cluding Lime Kiln guest actors and
actresses, individuals attracted to the
Horse Center and people from area
summer camps.

“Postmarks is like a college
book store without the books,”
Harb said. It consists of youthful
objects which can be used in “a
first home or college environment.”

Looking for merchandise, Harb
travels to various foreign countries,
including Guatemala, Mexico and
Portugal. Her next stop will be Sin-

gapore. She also sells items from
Japan, India and France. She works
with missionaries and workers in the
Peace Corps to get some of her
more unusual items.

Postmarks also sells “altemative
cards,” blank cards with designs on
the covers. Educational coloring
books and star-charts are also
among other “gadgets and gizmos,”

as Harb calls them, that Postmarks

offers.

 

“Postmarks is like a

college bookstore

without the books.”
— Susan Harb

Harb created Caravans after a
15-year journalism career. She said
she wanted a store that would con-
sist of travel items from all over the
world.

Harb said she chose Lexington
for one of her three Caravans stores
when she was passing through the
town on a skiing trip. She found a
“comfort about the town” that
made her want to move here.

Both Caravans and Postmarks
are open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday
through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Saturday, and noon to 6 p.m. Sun-
day.

CHARLOTTESVILLE — Saying

Sororities
complete
first rush

By Cecily Tynan
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee University’s
three sororities completed their first
rush Saturday, pledging a total of
25 upperclass women.

As a result of last week’s infor-
mal rush, 61 percent of all upper-
class women are in sororities. This
figure may continue to expand as
sororities are allowed to openly ex-
tend bids to upperclass women until
December 6.

“What happens with continuous
open bidding is that a chapter can
fill a chapter total, which has been
set at 87. At any time, a chapter
may extend a bid to a woman as
long as it is filed with Panhelleriic
within 24 hours,” said Wendy Wil-
son, panhellenic publicity, housing
and extension chairwoman. The
number for chapter total is taken
from the number of women each

' national sorority pledged in coloni-

zation last January.

The National Panhellenic Coun-
cil, which governs all national so-
rorities, has enacted this policy to
maintain equally sized chapters on
university campuses.

“At the present time, this brings
all three groups [Chi Omega, Kappa
Alpha Theta and Kappa Kappa Ga-
mma] within two to four of each
other — so we're equal sizes,” said
Wilson.

Unlike fraternity rush, where
some fraternities can get a large nu-
mber of pledges and others may
pledge only a few, the national rush
rules for sororities are designed to
prevent such discrepancies and com-
petition.

“Each group pledged girls they
wanted rather than numbers," said
Wilson.

Informal rush went “extremely
well,” according to Wilson, but will
probably not be repeated at W&L.
“We did it this year because we
had upperclass women who didn’t
choose to rush last January and we
wanted to give them as much time
to be active in a chapter as possible.
The fact the 33 women signed up
for informal rush shows that there
was the need,” said Wilson.

FD officers quit
in power struggle

By James Lake
Associate Editor

 

Fancy Dress Chairman Richard Spence and Vice
Chairman Alex Hitz have both resigned, only days
after they were appointed to those positions by the
Executive Committee.

Hitz, saying that “a situation which has started off
so badly can only worsen,” submitted his resignation
to the EC Monday. A returning SAB member with
what he called “extensive” Fancy Dress experience,
Hitz objected to the EC’s selection of Spence, who
Hitz said has no experience with the SAB or Fancy
Dress.

Spence, who applied for the newly created position
of auditor, said he decided to resign because he is
“neither prepared nor willing to take the authority for
this project when it is clear I will have my hands tied
from day one.” _

Spence said SAB Chairman Charles Conklin and

  

the states in the use of federal
funds, a restructuring of educational
systems on a state—by—state basis and
annual reports on progress toward
those goals.

Speaking at University Hall on
the UVa campus late Thursday
morning, Bush quoted the six-year-
old report of the Committee on Ex-
cellence in Education and said its
conclusion, that America is “a na-
tion at risk,” is still true today. And
Bush insisted greater federal funding
will not decrease that risk.

“Hard experience teaches that
we are simply not getting our mon-
ey’s worth in education,” said
Bush. “Our focus must no longer
be on resources. It must be on re-
suits.”

To that end, the president said,
“a radical departure from tradition”
is needed. He outlined five areas of
reform — literacy, diversity, parental

Wilson grants EC
additional funds

By Caroline Davis
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee President
John D. Wilson granted extra funds
totaling almost $16,000 to the
Executive Committee from a special
contingency fund last week.

According to Wilson, the funds
are to aid the EC in allocating
funds to such activities as the Ariel.

The funds were needed because
the EC carried the burden for the
losses incurred by the Student
Activities Board.

If the extra money could not be
found, then some of the funds for
these activities would have to be
cut, Wilson said.

“We aren't speaking speaking of
a reduction in funds, but literally
cut out of the budget,” said EC
President Willard Dumas.

other SAB members led him to believe that SAB deci-
sions would be kept from the EC and from the SAB.s
advisor, Dean Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins. He also said
Hitz, Conklin and Entertainment Coordinator Michael
Applebaum had already set the budget for the Fancy
Dress Concert and told him they had already chosen a
band.

Hitz applied for the position of FD chairman but
was named second-in-cornrnand to Spence, who had
applied for the newly-created position of auditor.

“I do not believe, after my own high school experi-
eiice and close involvement with last year’s Fancy
Dress, that anyone's high school experience or other
non-Fancy Dress related experience can be considered
as qualifying,” Hitz wrote.

“The positions governing Fancy Dress, whether
they be as chairman and vice chairman or as co—chair-
men, are too closely intertwined and require too much
teamwork for there not to he must, honesty and integri-
ty between the two people involved,” wrote Hitz.

After the selection of Hitz and Spence last week,
SAB Chairman Charles Conklin met with the two FD
officers to discuss their job descriptions. After that
meeting, Spence said he felt the EC had vested total
authority in him, but he said Hitz wanted total creative
control and to report to Spence only when he was
ready to make comrriitments.

‘‘I am not going to be the" ﬁnancial scapegoat for
something I’m clearly not going to have any control
over," said Spence.

progress and a commitment to high
standards.

First, Bush said, “We must be a
reading nation." He called for a
more involved educational process
in which “children must do more
than identify names on a multiple-
choice question” and which never
promotes a student ‘-‘just because he
or she has passed an arbitrary birth-
day.”

Second, America's schools
should “be unafraid of diversity."
While all schools should share mini-
mum standards and a core curricu-
lum, “the means by which that cur-
riculum is taught and those goals
met should be as diverse and varied
as America itself,” he said. “Let us
give " our schools and our teachers
the freedom to do what they do
best.”

SAB woes worsen

EC hears charges,
issues ultimatum

By Melinda Conkling
Staff Reporter

After hearing charges that Student Activities Board
Chairman Charles Conklin held secret meetings and
planned to keep some information from the Executive
Committee, the EC has given Conklin two weeks to
implement reforms and alter SAB policies.

“I think he realizes this is an ultimatum and he’s
got to produce,” EC Secretary Chris Giblin said at
Monday’s EC meeting.

Vice President John Sheinberg agreed and told
Conklin what changes the EC expects.

“You need to take control of your organization and
see to it that procedural changes are made, budgetary
restraints are continued along the way they’re going,”
Sheinberg said. “Every board member has an equal
voice. Your meetings need to be run orderly and ratio-
nally. Things need to be approved as a committee, not
as individuals. If you can't make these changes, I
beseech you, say so, because if you can’t, we will
place someone else in your position."

The EC‘s ultimatum was issued after Conklin at-
tempted to explain his reasons for not implementing
changes suggested by the EC. These changes in SAB
procedure, which EC members said they listed at a
Sept. 18 meeting with Conklin, included holding SAB
meetings in an organized manner in the EC room;
keeping complete minutes and attendance records for
those meetings; and consulting the SAB’s treasurer
before committing to any expenditures.

Monday’s warning to Conklin followed complaints
by SAB Treasurer Katie Duwel and Fancy Dress Chair-
man Richard Spence. The EC heard those complaints
in a special meeting Thursday night.

At the Thursday meeting, Duwel charged that the
SAB was holding “secret meetings” behind her back
and that she was not present while any votes were
taken. She said Conklin once told her to “shut up”
when she asked him a question during an SAB meet-
ing.
“My hands are tied,” she said. “We have no
group discussions being made. There are no decisions,
no votes, no anything. I don't know what’s going on.
There’s a lot of covert activity, they’re making deci-
sions without the entire board.”

Also Thursday, Spence told the EC that he could
not work with the SAB “as it stands."

He said “it has become plainly apparent to me”
that there are problems in the board.

“Any committee that is subordinate to the EC and
excludes their treasurer, faculty representative, and EC

see improved relations

By Brian Root
Senior Copy Editor

Relations between Washington
and Lee’s fraternities and the police
are the best they have been in
years, said Lexington Police Chief
Bruce Beard at Tuesday night's
lnterfratcmity Council meeting.

Assessing relations between
police and the fraternities, Beard
said, “This year has been the best
in my more than 20 years on the
force.“

Also, none of the fraternities
made any complaints about the
police’s conduct since the end of
the formal rush period which ended
Sept. 23.

Also, Tad Kelley, the IFC’s
Public Relations Chairman, reported
that Alcohol Awareness Week will
begin Sunday, Oct. 15. Kelley said
the Health Education Committee,
which is sponsoring the week, will

conduct an alcohol awareness
seminar. All fraternity freshmen
must attend.

In addition, Kelley said, the

committee will sponsor two band

parties, one at the student pavilion
and one at the General Headquarters
restaurant.

IFC President Kevin Nash
reminded the fraternities of the
IFC's regulation that requires houses
to provide “altemative beverages”
at all parties, as well as to maintain
a more strict entrance policy. Nash
said each fraternity should not allow
people to leave the party with open
containers of alcohol, and to keep
the noise level as low as possible.

Nash also restated the IFC's
policy on how many parties a
fraternity may have at its house
each month. A house may have four
weekend parties at the house, and
an additional two Wednesday night
parties at the house, rather than
simply four parties per month, as
was reported last week.

The IFC also considered, but did
not act on, a proposal to contribute
money for a band to perform at the
student pavilion during Christmas
Weekend. The Student Activities
Board, because of its current
financial problems, has considered
cancelling the concert, according to
IFC Secretary Gordon Dekuyper.

OPINION


 The SABs long.

 and winding road

The S, A and B keys on The Ring-tum Phi’s computer
-;«_’ are wearing out in a hurry. The resignations of the two
I students most responsible for Washington and Lee’s
biggest social event, the Fancy Dress Ball, are only the
latest turns in a series of crises to hit W&L’s Student
Activities Board.

"f Rarely has a single subject commanded more space in
The Ring-tum Phi and more time in Executive Committee
meetings. And the events of the past few days indicate
there are still many miles left on what has already been a
rough road.

After the controversy of 1988 (remember the “Reconcil-
=5‘! iation Ball” that was anything but?), everyone was
 desperately hoping for a smoothly run, well-received FD
in 1989. And we thought we had one — until the bills
.¢,;.— came in. Like that Visa bill at the end of the month, the
 fare for W&L’s midnight excursion on the Orient Express
seemed much higher than anyone — including SAB
leaders — had expected.

The EC was less than pleased. With the threat of
administration intervention hanging over its head, the EC
tried to meet last year’s expenses without eliminating this
year’s budget entirely. As the EC moved in, the already
1* cliquish SAB became even more so. A “we-they”
 mentality developed. A crisis was guaranteed.

The crisis became public when SAB Treasurer Katie
Duwel and FD Chairman Richard Spence came forward
with reports of exactly what the EC did not want to hear.

.., ._ _,, u .1, .._., .4;
; A ‘-3 i" 4.4 J 5‘

business as usual in the SAB office — the same business
that led to a debt that now exceeds $23,000.

Of course, there is far more to this mess than Conklin’s
failure to implement the needed changes. There is the
dirty, cynical question of whether the fact that Spence,
Dumas and junior EC Rep. John Fialcowitz are roommates
had anything to do with Spence’s appointment. Such ugly
suspicions combined with the cliquishness of the SAB and
Spence’s lack of FD and SAB experience to make his
task an impossible one.

First, the roommate factor. Any upperclassman should

know that Dumas bent over backwards last spring to
avoid even the appearance of bias. When the EC voted in
favor of a special election after the president-elect
withdrew from W&L, the vote was 6-5. Dumas abstained.
At the time, it appeared his abstention might have cost
him what was rightfully his — the presidency. Fortunately,
the EC reconsidered, but not until Dumas had proven that
his commitment to impartiality is beyond reproach.
'~ ’ That commitment continued in the discussion of who
should chair this year’s Fancy Dress Ball. The EC
received only one application — that of Alex Hitz. As he
explains elsewhere on this page, he was the only applicant
- for any FD position with SAB and FD experience. What
; he does not say is that Spence, while still in high school,
organized two Key Club conventions, both involving
larger budgets and more people than Fancy Dress could
ever have.

Dumas, Fialcowitz and the rest of the EC wisely were
not limited by their applicant pool. Ever-mindful of last
year’s problems, they looked for »the most qualiﬁed, most
: organized person. And, in an 8-4 decision, they chose
Spence. Yes, Fialcowitz and Dumas voted. No, their votes
did not matter — only four EC members felt Hitz was
more qualified than Spence, not enough to swing the vote
his way. And, no, their friendship with Spence did not
f affect the EC’s debate or the votes of other members. As
' Secretary Chris Giblin said, “That didn’t even enter into
the discussion.”

What next? First, the EC will try to ﬁll the now-vacant
ﬂ FD positions. We encourage all interested students to
 apply —- whether or not they have SAB experience. And
we encourage Conklin to remember well the words of EC
,. Vice President Jon Sheinberg: “You need to take control
, of your organization and see to it that procedural changes
are made, budgetary constraints are continued along the
; way they are going. Every board member has an equal
2 voice. Your meetings need to be orderly and rational.
Things need to be approved as a committee, not as
individuals. If you can’t make these changes, I beseech
you, say so, because if you can’t we will place someone
else in your position.”

The student body deserves nothing less.

Fancy Dress officers jump ship

By Alexander Hitz

EDITOR'S NOTE: Alexander Hitz was named Fancy Dress vice-chairman
by the Executive Committee last week but resigned Monday. This is his letter

of resignation.

By Richard Spence

EDITOR'S NOTE: Late last month, Richard Spence was named Chairman
of the 1990 Fancy Dress Ball. He resigned from that position Wednesday.

It is with deep regret that I must resign as vice-chairman of Fancy Dress
1990. However, in good conscience, all things considered, I do not feel that
the Executive Comrnittee’s decision to name me vice—chairman without my
previous consent — or even an application for that position — is one that I
can support by accepting the position. Also, considering the circumstances
following the Executive Committee's decision of September 25, and my
experience so far with the current Fancy Dress chairman, I am sure that a
situation that has started off so badly can only worsen. The positions
governing Fancy Dress, whether they be as chairman and vice-chairrnan, or
as co-chairmen, are too closely intertwined and require too much team—work
for there not to be trust, honesty, and integrity between the two people
involved. After hearing of Thursday night’s Executive Committee meeting,
which the current Fancy Dress chairman attended, I can honestly say that I
do not believe such a rapport exists at present or can ever exist in the

future.  ‘
I do}-.not ‘feel. that the

EC’s decision to

the Executive Committee whether I name me Vice chaff.
would be willin to ace t a .
position other thin the on? for man wlthout my pre-

which I applied. I would have vious consent is one

answered affirmatively, provided the

person under whom I would be I can support‘

working has more relevant — AIexandef 
experience than I do. By relevant

experience in this instance, I mean previous, extensive involvement with
last year's Fancy Dress, in addition to participation in the Fancy Dress
Steering Comrriittee, and probably Student Activities Board experience also.
I do not believe after my own high school experience, and close
involvement with last year's Fancy Dress, that anyone’s high school
experience or other non-Fancy Dress related experience can be considered
as qualifying. For Fancy Dress, I do not believe that appointing individuals
to positions for which they have not applied is an action done in the
student body’s best interest. It is impossible for people who have never
worked on Fancy Dress to know this.

I find it very regrettable that the situation has turned out so badly and so
grossly out of proportion regardless of whatever good intentions were
involved in the original decision-making process. A tradition as important
as Fancy Dress at Washington and Lee should not be in the hands of

someone who does not know its intricacies intimately. I am also sorry that
I will not be involved in Fancy Dress this year. Had I not really wanted to
take an active role in Fancy Dress and thought that I could make an
integral contribution to its success, I would not have applied for a position

“Experience” is a term used to describe relative knowledge a person or
an organization may have of a specific task or position. Over the past eight
days, I have found that the Student Activities Board has developed its own
definition of “experience,” one which you may be as confused and
dismayed over as I am.

On the night of Sept. 29, I interviewed for the position of auditor for the
1990 Fancy Dress Ball. The Executive Committee, in its “inﬁnite
wisdom," decided to overlook the applicants for chairman and vice
chairman, and appointed me chairman. I’ll be the first to admit to you that
their methods of appointment are somewhat callous. However, I met with
the SAB chairman Tuesday afternoon, eager to begin to work with the FD
and SAB committees. What I learned over the next 24 hours or so was
that I had, in effect, been named “captain” of a ship that had sunk before
it left drydock.

I was so shocked by what I was told by the SAB’s Charles Conklin,
speaking as»“Chair‘rnan of his Board,” that I left our midnight-2:30 a.m.

- meeting with a list of every one ‘of his notable quotes. What ‘he (and then-

Vice‘ Chairman Alex Hitz) said that evening speaks for itself and will
provide ample examples of the fundamental problem with the current board.

I was told by Conklin:

- the SAB would not be running Fancy Dress this year as it had in the
past few years.

- the current SAB treasurer, Katie Duwel, was not working out - she is
left out of most major board decisions. Katie called up EC Vice President
Jon Sheinberg whenever we decided anything important.

- the board had planned meetings to coincide with weekly IFC meetings
so they could keep the SAB faculty advisor, Dean Leroy C. “Buddy”
Atkins, from attending SAB board activities.

- the board operated without the cooperation of their EC representative
last year, and this year the relationship was tentative. There is a feeling
that the EC does not trust us and we certainly don't trust them.

- the SAB felt “many of the things that go on in this (SAB) office are
none of the EC’s business.  They are confidential discussions.”

Also, Alex Hitz told me:

- “I have already chosen the people I wanted to work with, and you are
not my choice. I have worked out with Charles and Michael [Applebaurn,
Concert Coordinator] the budget for FD Thursday night, and we’ve
basically chosen the band and budgeted our expected loss.”

'- he would not accept “a VICE chairmanship,” and, if I was not willing
to compromise on the position, he would use his friendship with 1989 FD
Chairwoman Liz Smith to keep her from helping me and from turning over
to me her ﬁles on last year’s ball, which are the only un—altered documents
available and are housed at her residence. (The files in the FD desk of the
SAB office represent, in Conklin’s words, “creative bookkeeping," and, in
my words, represent fraud, gross mismanagement and, dare I say it, lies...)

as important as chairman.

James Lake's ideas on how to ﬁght terror-
ism (MY VIEW, Sept. 21, 1989) certainly
sound terrific; after all, talking about terrorisim
is much like being ‘tough’ on crime: it is an
easy position to take and failure to do so is
the political (and social, here at W&L) equiva-
lent of seppuku. Worse, one’s friends and
fellow citizens may call you a coward, an ap-
peaser and a wimp if you don’t. However, I
must disagree with Mr. Lake because the inevi-
table outcome of his proposal is, I suspect, not
in the best interests of this country.

Mr. Lake's idea is this: the American hos-
tages in Lebanon must be freed; their captors
require Iranian encouragement and support to
survive; Iran must sever this relationship; U.S.
military action against vital Iranian oil facilities
at Kharg Island will accomplish this goal; this
military action will “eventually .. succeed”
with acceptable losses for our side; failure to
support this is cowardly and dishonorable. I
take issue with each assumption.

Mr. Lake tells us his plan is simple. This is
how it will work: the President announces that
U.S. forces will begin bombing Iranian oil
facilities at Kharg island in 48 hours, unless all
American hostages are set free. If the hostag-
es are not_freed then the bombers roll. If the
Iranians are still unimpressed then we repeat.
Eventually, we move inland and bomb the
Iranian mainland itself. The Iranian.leadership',
logically, will abhor bloodshed, and capitulate.
Doesn't this sound great so far? Unfortunate-
ly, I see a few problems.

First, why give a 48-hour advance warning,

  

LETTERS

unless you wish to alert Iranian anti-aircraft
defenses and waste our pilot’s lives? Second,
Mr. Lake’s faith in strategic bombing, bom-
bardment intended to break an adversary psy-
chologically rather than rriilitarily, is not shared
by many military strategists, historians and sol-
diers. Strategic bombing did not break the
will of the North Vietnamese people or their
government, nor did it succeed against the
British and the Germans in World War II. But
no matter, bombing Kharg doesn’t work, we
will bomb Iran itself, the Iranian government
will panic and then collapse. Mr. Lake doesn’t
suggest what we should bomb when we reach
the mainland. I wonder if he intends to blitz-
krieg Tehran? He also grants the Iranian lead-
ers a logic and rationality which they show no
signs of possessing. Let’s not assume that all
people are motivated by the same things Am-
ericans are. Perhaps the Iranians like to take
hostages (they have done it before). Also, per-
haps their government needs a foreign enemy
to distract their people's attention away from
problems at home. If so, then Iran might wel-
come a U.S attack. Don’t forget that Iran and
Iraq have recently ended their own 8-year war,
one of the bloodiest conflicts of this century.
Iran showed no reluctance to waste the lives of
of their citizens in furtherence of political ob-
jectives.

Before we endorse Mr. Lake's idea, let's be
sure we recognize what the implications are.
War. That is what he suggests. That is what
bombing is all about. I do not say that military
action in furtherence of direct U.S national»
security interests is never necessary. Clearly, it

Student reevaluates U.S.— Iran hostage issue

sometimes is, but I cannot believe our vital
national interests are threatened by the exis-
tence of some fanatic kidnappers and their
small number of American hostages, somewh-
ere in Lebanon. Yes, this is a tragic event and

.we should and will continue to seek their re-

lease. But war? Is that the price we’re willing
to pay? I doubt that.

I think we should remember one more fact.
The U.S only recently ended hostilities in the
Persian Gulf. Do we really want to return to
that, and can we afford to (this country of ours
is darrm near broke, or has no one noticed)?

Finally, if the American people think the
agonies of 10 15 hostages justifies a war then
they will, presumably, say so. In that case the
U.S military will follow orders and kill Irani-
ans. Some American, who can saw how many,
will die. Let’s not kid ourselves, that's what
will happen, but if that is the national will, so
be it. Let’s just be sure it's worth it.

I recently had the dubious honor to spend a
total of eight months, courtesy of the Depart-
ment of Defense, 'In the same miserablre part
of the world that Mr. Lake wishes to attack.
Now, I have no idea what plans Mr. Lake has
after graduation, but I suspect they don't in-
clude personal participation in the attacks he
supports. If he does wish to participate, I wish
him well but suspect his martial fervor will
cool as he approaches the North Arabian Sea. I
know mine did. Furmy how that works, don't
you think?

Staff Reporter

The fate of Trident, the
organization founded “ to meet the
growing needs of women students
on the W&L canpus,” has not yet

been determined, according to
Associate Dean of Students Anne
Schroer—Lamont.

Schroer—Lamont believes that
since the arrival of sororities,

upperclass women have shifted their
attentions toward the Greek system
and have left Trident without
leadership. As a result, the group is
desperately seeking “women with
energy who are willing to devote
three to eight hours per week," said
Schroer—Lamont. She predicts that
without dedicated students, the

organization will not be able to
sustain itself.

Schroer—Lamont also realizes
that even if Trident is able to
assemble an executive board, its
intentions will still be subject to
change. Although the group hopes

to continue sponsoring its social
events, “Winter Slos ” and
“Confetti's," this year's winter

celebration may not be possible,
since no dues were collected this
fall.

Schroer-Larnont said Trident's
focus may shift toward different
activities. Possibilities for the
coming year include working with
the sororities to acquire a house
they could share. Trident would also
like to reintroduce ideas for events
such as art exhibits, receptions, and
lectures, Schroer-Lamorrt said.

SAB

representative from their activities
does not in my opinion deserve to
serve the EC,” said Spence.

Spence also said Conklin once
told SAB members that much of
what they discuss is “none of the
EC’s business.”

After hearing from Spence and
Duwel, EC members expressed their
own concerns about SAB proce-
dures. President Willard Dumas
said, “The attitudes that I've experi-
enced with this board have been
blatantly adversarial. "

Junior Rep. Tom Hatcher said,
“My main concern is with regards
to the student allocation of funds. I
have not seen the leadership I ex-
pected, the people I have faith in
have been alienated.”

Several EC members said the
EC cannot absorb another ﬁnancial
loss like the one suffered by the
SAB last year, which Dumas said
now exceeds $20,000.

“We have exhausted good faith
in these people. We received assur-
ances two weeks ago. Why must I
continue to extend good faith to
subcommittees of the EC," Dumas
asked.

Junior Rep. John Fialcowitz ex-
pressed tiie same opinion. “We
can't justvtrust that these atrocities
won't happen again, ” he said.

Thursday’s special meeting
ended when the EC adjourned with-
out making any ﬁnal decision.

Conklin was present at that meeting
but, when EC members asked him
about speciﬁc charges, he repeatedly
told them, “I don't recall.”

After the meeting, he refused to
comment on the allegations made
against him.

Conklin decided to present his
case at the Monday night meeting.
He apologized for his previous si-
lence and said that he wanted to
stay “in power, chairman of the
SAB.”

“If you give me a couple of
weeks I’ll work it all out,” he said.

When asked whether he ever
said some SAB discussions or activ-
ities were “none of the EC’s busi-
ness,” Conklin said it is not the
SAB’s policy to keep anything hid-
den from the EC.

Conklin said the SAB’s faculty
advisor, Dean Leroy C. “Buddy”
Atkins, was not present at the SAB
Board meetings because Atkins “in-
timidated one of my Board mem-
bers. I felt like I shouldn't exclude
him but at the same time he
shouldn't be in all of our meetings
if he’s going to hinder that person’s
speaking up or taking part in the
meetings.”

Conklin also said he can only
listen to one person at a time during
a meeting and may have asked
Duwel to be quiet while another

person was speaking. But he said he .

wants every SAB member to con-
tribute to discussions.

Third-year law Rep. David An-
thony warned Conklin that SAB
board member revisions will be
made in the immediate future if
changes are not made.

“I guess the bottom line is, do
you understand if changes aren’t
made that we will take action, ”
said Anthony.

“Certainly,” said Conklin.

In other business Monday night,
James Rambeau, chairman of the
Student Financial Relations
Committee, reported that because of
national policies Harris Teeter and
WalMart are required. to request
identiﬁcation from check writers.
WalMart representatives said that
they would contact their national
headquarters to see if the
identiﬁcation process could be
waived for W&L students.

The GHQ Lacrosse Club and
Mock Convention representatives
discussed budget requests. Gary
McCullough of Amnesty
International asked that the EC
review their decision of not granting
funds to Anmesty. A motion to
grant a budget request of $140

.failed.

Also, the EC reported that there
were sufﬁcient applications received
for the Student Health Committee.
Applications are still being accepted
for the Library Advisory, Registrar
& Scheduling, University Athletics
and Financial Aid committees.
Interviews for these positions will
be held Monday at 8 pm.

Phi Delta Theta's application will
not be approved until the fraternity
complies with the university's hous-
ing standards, and is off probation.
Atkins said the project will start
on time in spring 1990. However,
Nash said questions that must be
answered by Lexington zoning ofﬁ-
cials, may hold things up.
Bass Construction is working as
a general contractor for the project,
helping the committee provide cost
estimates for each house and the
Renaissance Program in general.
Nash said the committee has spent a
good deal of time comparing new
cost estimates to the originals.
Atkins said plans for reconstruc-
tion will work on a rotating basis.
“After the demolition crew ﬁn-

ishes at one house, they will move
on to the next as the construction
crew begins at the first house,”
Atkins said.

Because of that schedule there

may be a number of fraternity
houses unsuitable for living, eating,

parties, and rush functions once the
project is under way. The committee
has not yet submitted any ﬁnal pro-
posals regarding these issues.

Some students may be housed in
empty rooms in Gaines Hall, Woods
Creek, and other university housing,
but the rest will have to live with
friends off—campus, Atkins said.
Nash said students will probably eat
in Evans Dining Hall. No decisions
have been made regarding parties or
nrsh functions for houses during
their renovation.

From the W&L News Ofﬂce

A memorial service honoring
General Robert E. Lee will be held
at noon Thursday, Oct. 12, in Lee
Chapel on the Washington and Lee
campus. The ceremony will mark
the 119th anniversary of the passing
of Lee, who served as president of
Washington College from 1865 to
1870.

The day’s activities will begin at
_9330 3-In-. the time of Lee's death
in 1870, when the bells in the cha-

pel will toll 19 times — equivalent
to a l9—gun salute. At noon, the
Liberty Hall Volunteers, a group of
W&L students and employees inter-
ested in Civil War reenactment, will
march from Washington Hall on the
W&L campus to Lee Chapel.

The memorial service will begin
at noon in Lee Chapel. I. Taylor
Sanders, university historian and
professor of history at W&L, will
speak on the life of Lee and his
contributions to Washington College.

The service is sponsored by the

Liberty Hall Volunteers.

Ponderings of political poppycock

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

As a journalist in a democratic society, it is
my duty to keep readers up to date on important
political issues such as the latest developments
in President Bush’s ongoing war against drugs:
yesterday a U.S. army regiment was ambushed
by P.C.P. paratroopers in the Heroin Hills of
Southern Colombia. The deadly P.C.P.
paratroopers, who were armed with syringes,
hallucinations and German Beer Hops wiped out
the whole regiment in less than an hour.
According to government sources who are so
bored that they keep up with these kinds of
things, this was the worst battle since the July
Marijuana Massacre in which three U.S. Navy
air craft carriers were sunk by a powerful
Steroid Submarine. At this point, careful readers
with news oriented brains should be asking six
obvious questions: 1) Why is President Bush
waging a war against inanimate objects? 2a)
Shouldn’t the war be against "illegal drugs"?
2b) What does the president have against
cough syrup? 3a) What kind of drugs was the
writer using at the time that this article was
written? 3b) Cough Syrup? 4) Why doesn’t
someone invent grey beer? 5) In reference to
questions 1-4, who cares?

like a good time to move onto another exciting
political issue such as the one involving New
York Mayor Ed Koch. You remember Mayor
Koch don't you? The first American politician
who spent the majority of his time in ofﬁce
roaming the streets of New York asking arbitrary
people the same question.

Mayor Koch (speaking to an arbitrary
person): "What am I doing?"

The Arbitrary person: "Roaming the
streets of New York asking rhetorical
questions when you could be doing something
productive like painting the Statue of
Liberty."

Getting back to major political developments,
Koch was recently defeated in his bid for re-
election. Of course, the fact of his defeat is not
surprising since Koch was thought to be
something of a weirdo in a city where there are
lobotornized rnirnes dressed in drag on every
street corner.

As I shock my brain with high voltage
creativity electrodes in an attempt to fabricate (I
mean remember) another major political issue it
just occurred to me that most major political
issues involve something boring like the trade
deﬁcit or farm subsidies. I guess this explains
why many newspapers no longer cover major
political developments. These papers have
discovered that the American public wants to

viewers and uses it to have Naked Putt-Putt Golf
Parties in mega-sized mansions, not the General
Accounting Ofﬁce. The American public wants
to read about President Bush's recent ﬁshing
trip, not the Middle East. The American public
wants to read about famous drug-addicted actors
getting admitted to the Betty Ford Clinic, not
Gorbachev. The American Public wants to read
about violent crime, not the Senate. And most
of all, the American public (especially the
American public that is now reading this article)
wants to read about books written by the victims
and perpetrators of violent crime. Well reader,
if that's what you really want, okay.

Dallas — A suburban housewife who was
repeatedly raped, stabbed and trampled upon
by a coalition group of Hells Angels, Ku Klux
Klansman, and Skin Heads is now in the
process of writing a book about her ordeal.
Her book, "It’s a Violent World But
Someone’s Got To Live In It" is scheduled for
publication in late January.

In the meantime the Angels-Klan-Skinhead
coalition, currently out on bail, have all
become Born Again Hari Krishnas. The
Coalition, which has formed a monastery in
Oregon, is also writing a book about their
experiences, "From Killing to Krishna, the
Journal of Reformed Renegades."

Because I sense that this article is killing

Since we have exhausted the subject of the
President's continuing "War on Drugs," it seems

SPENCE-

from page 2

I won’t bore you with the rest of
the details, but sufﬁce it to say
there are plenty more. For example,
I suggested that, if I were to take
the responsibility for this entire
project ﬁnancially, there would be
an end to charge accounts at
virtually every store in Lexington,
including the Virginia ABC Store,
East Lex, Willson-Walker House,
McCambell Inn, etc., for extraneous
“fringe beneﬁts" for “the Board."
Charles and Alex both were enraged
by that idea. They claimed these
accounts never existed and I was
unreasonable not to expect some
fringe beneﬁts be awarded to “the
Board” for a job well done.

I don’t think blatant
mismanagement of student funds
resulting in consecutive losses — the
SAB “experience” of Fancy Dress
’89 lost over $20,000, though the

balance sheet reports a net profit of
over $1,200 — is a job well done.
Further, there was no reason for
these two ofﬁcers to be defensive
about my allegations because there
are no written records left to
account for these expenses. They
disappeared in the “creatively kept”
closing statements of FD 1989
housed in the “creatively run” SAB
executive ofﬁce.

I am not blaming the current
SAB hierarchy for last year’s
problems, although these people
were all a part of that situation. The
fundamental problem lies in the
operating premise of the SAB. This
sub-committee ignores its EC
representatives, its faculty advisor,
and its treasurer. It is responsible
for $40,000-plus in student body
funds and acts as parent of the FD
Steering Committee, given roughly

TALKBACK

read about wild television preachers like Jim
Baker, who takes money from poor television

brain cells,

$50,000 in student body funds. Its
chairman claims that its business is
“confidential.” The board presented
me with what I would honestly call
extorted temis but will refer to as a
“package deal,” the bottom line
being my cooperation with their
system in exchange for their support
operating FD.

The SAB treasurer has thrown up
the warning signs countless times
before. This past weekend she and I
threw them up one more time. The
EC decided Monday that the
circumstances listed above warranted
no change and voted 7-4 to give
this committee yet another in their
long line of “fresh starts." This
same EC decided I had the best
past experience to restore credibility
to the operation of Fancy Dress.
Their decisions travel in circles,

I desperately need to stop writing

before it’s too lat

leading nowhere — like the current
SAB.

I am neither prepared nor willing
to take the authority for this project
when it is clear I will have my
hands tied from day one.’
Committing academic suicide and/or
withdrawing from school should not
be a part of student-run

entertainment, yet they have all

played a role in the not-so-distant’

past of FD chairmen. I wish the EC
a lot of luck as this operation
unfolds, and I hope the
administration doesn't use this
year’s FD red ink to write the
epitaph to student-run entertainment
at W&L.

My resignation as chairman of
1990 Fancy Dress Ball was

delivered Wednesday morning.

 
  
 

What do you think of sororities’ having
Homecoming representatives?

Nelson Teague, ‘90, Roanoke,
Va. — “I’m bent out of shape
because none of them asked me
to escort them."

Brooke Tinley, ‘91, Timonium,
Md. — “It’s too unconventional.
I think sororities are trying to
push themsleves to be too much
like fraternities."

Michael Higginbotham, ‘90,
Memphis, Tenn. — “I think
it’s a terrible idea."

Andrew Keller, ‘92, Rochester,
N.Y. — “I feel that on a carn-
pus that is becoming more and
more diverse every day, it is im-
portant that the sororities should
have Homecoming representa-
trves."

 

Mena McGowin, ‘91, Point
Clear, Al. — “I think it’s

“Education is not a utility, not

Fourth, Bush said, “We must act

Finally, standards and expecta-

America be forgotten or forsaken.”
In brief remarks at the summit's
closing ceremony Thursday after-
noon, the president, using UVa’s
Rotunda as a backdrop, ran down
what he saw as the highlights of “a
very successful conference.”
Referring to the joint statement
issued by the president and the gov-
emors, Bush touched on topics he
had mentioned in his morning ad-
dress and also suggested the federal
government will continue and per-
haps expand its support of Head
Start and other pre-school programs.
Bush also promised his commit-
ment to education would not end
when he left Charlottesville. “This
has been historic, and I pledge to
you my determination 1.0 follow
up,” he said.

“Racist, sexist, anti—gay, President

by the crowd supported ideas as
diverse as privatizing education, the
Equal Rights Amendment and victo-

over rebels in Nicarggua.

A hike up House Mountain with
., Washigton and Lee President John
Wilson and a white-water rafting
4 trip on one of the most challenging
‘ rivers in the East are just two of
the many upcoming activities
. planned by the W&L Outing Club
this fall.
‘ The Outing Club will offer
, W&L students more activities this
‘year than ever before, and faculty
‘ sponsor Kirk Follo said he invites
students to “find out what they are
interested in and come see what we
t have to offer." -
1988 marked the first year that a
" faculty member has been involved
, with the club, and Follo’s addition
has allowed the club to expand its
“ offering of programs and expedi-
., tions.
Follo said the Outing Club is
' not a club in the sense that students
, join and pay membership dues, but
instead is an organization that plans
4 trips and activities and also provides
equipment for students who wish to
“ do things on their own. The club's
. equipment room, located in Room
109 of Baker Dormitory, has tents,
sleeping bags, stoves, backpacks,

V

 

canoes, kayaks, rock-climbing equip-
ment and spelunking equipment
available for students to borrow.
Students may also rent canoes for a
small fee.

According to Follo, the club is
divided into a number of special
interest sections, including paddling,
ﬂy fishing, hiking and backpacking,
rock climbing, biking (both moun-
tain and road racing) and environ-
mental sections.

“There is a strong corps of stu-
dents active in each section,” Follo
said, adding that there are also stu-
dents who “come and go.”

On Wednesday, the club is
sponsoring a hike up House Moun-
tain with Wilson, a trip that will be
“a great chance for students‘ to get
to know him outside of the formal
setting of W&L," Follo said. The
group will depart at 2 p.m. from the
Outing Club office, and interested
students should sign up on the bul-
letin board outside of the club’s
equipment room.

The club also has an exciting
expedition planned for Oct. 13-15,
when students will travel to the
Mount Rogers National Recreation
Area and hike a series of trails, in-
cluding an extensive section of the
Appalachian Trail. Backpackers will

Rogers, which is the highest peak in
Virginia. Most of the hiking should
be easy to moderate in difficulty,
Follo said. students should wear
sturdy shoes and come prepared for
wet and/or cold weather, he said.
Interested students should contact
Gray Rand.

The club’s paddling section has
scheduled a white-water rafting trip
down the Gauley River, and stu-
dents interested in this excursion
should contact Mark Lubkowitz. Ac-
cording to Follo, the rafting trips
are led by an experienced outfitter,
and the club simply provides trans-
portation to the river.

In addition to special trips, the
club’s sections offer regular instruc-
tion in canoeing, kayaking, ﬂy fish-
ing, proper use of camping equip-
ment and backpacking skills. In con-
junction with the W&L biology de-
partment, the club offers instruction
in plant and insect identification and
sponsors occasional “ecology
walks.” Students active in the bik-
ing section take regular rides, while
students in the paddling section
provide kayaking instruction every
Tuesday and Thursday nights from
6-8 in the old pool in Doremus
Gym.

Club activities are posted regularly
on the club's colonnade bulletin
board outside of Payne Hall, on the
bulletin board in Baker Donn and in

The men’s soccer team soundly
defeated a pair of Old Dominion
Athletic Conference rivals this week
at Liberty Hall Field.

Playing in their first two
conference games of the season, the
Generals downed Roanoke 4-1 on
Saturday, and beat Hampden—Sydney
2-0 yesterday.

On Saturday the Generals’ four
goals were scored by three
freshmen. Freshman Mike
Mitchem, who has scored four goals
and dished out four assists in the
last four games, netted two goals,
while classmates Mike Hill and
Todd Walker each scored their first
collegiate goals.

Senior Patrick Brown, who has
not directly figured in the scoring
since the Generals’ second game,
registered three assists on Saturday
and scored a goal yesterday against
Harnpden-Sydney.

Roanoke, the defending ODAC
champions, came to Lexington on a
gray and drizzly Saturday afternoon
with a 3-4 record.

W&L picked up momentum with
two goals in the latter part of the
first half. The Generals took a 1-0
lead at 9:05 when Brown assisted
Hill, who sent the ball past a prone
Maroon goalie.

Just over five rriiniites later
W&L was awarded a penalty kick
after a Roanoke defenseman used
his hands to stop a shot. Mitchem
took the free kick and delivered a
high, right-footed shot inside the left
post to give the Generals a 2-0
halftime advantage.

In the second half W&L closed
the door on Roanoke with their
third goal at 39:20. Freshman
sweeper Greg Williams tapped a
direct kick from midfield to Brown,
who crossed the ball deep into the
left side of the penalty box.
Mitchem collected the pass with his
chest and directed the ball to the

Yesterday, W&L improved its
record to 4-4 against visiting
Hampden—Sydney (5-4, 2-2 in the
ODAC). The Tigers were ranked
tenth in the South Region of
Division III.

The game was scoreless until
Brown trapped a deflected ball in
the penalty box and launched a shot
amid a pack of Tigers into the back
of the net at 7:51.

Although Harnpden-Sydney only
managed to get off two first half
shots, W&L was fortunate to have a
1-0 lead at intermission. Many of
the Tigers’ would—be shots were
well wide of the net and they blew
their two breakaway opportunities
by opting to shoot around a
charging Jon Bull, who has emerged
as the Generals starting goalie,
instead of dribbling around him.

The Generals took a 2-0 lead 21
minutes into the second half.
Mitchem sent a crossing pass from
the left side to the front of the net.

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

For a while last Saturday, it
looked like the armual Washington
and Lee-Randolph-Macon football
game was going to be the typical
nail-biter that Generals faithful have
come to expect between the teams.

That illusion lasted for the better
part of the first quarter at Day Field
in Ashland.

Then, the Generals’ record
setting quarterback went to work.
On W&L’s second possession,
senior Phillip Sampson went to the
air. His first pass, to junior split end
Craig Irons, gained 13 yards and a
first down. His second pass, also to
Irons, was good for 40 yards deep
into Yellow Jacket territory. Irons
was one step from turning the big
gainer into a 65-yard touchdown,
but he was caught by the last man
who had a shot at the 20 yard line.

This drive stalled as the
Generals elected to go for a first
down on fourth and 10 instead of
kicking a field goal. Sampson's pass
intended for Irons was just

twenty-nine seconds when she took
first place in the meet with a time

“The runners at Norfolk State

she was worried throughout the race
that the woman closest behind her

the course's end,” said head coach

Finishing in the top seven were

volleyball team won its first outing
in Old Dominion Athletic
Conference competition last week
over Lynchburg College.

After losing the opening game of

the match, 15-11, the Generals
rallied behind strong play from
sophomores Marcy Brown and

Mena McGowin to win the next
three games by scores of 15-7, 15-
12, and 17-15. Brown had a leading
.353 attack percentage in the victory
while McGowin registered 18 kills.
Freshman Leslie Hess and
junior Lisa Jay had good
performances last week as Hess _led
the team with 34 digs, and Jay
turned in a tearn-leading 13 service
aces.
The Generals struggled in other
competition last week with losses to

Shenandoah 15-11, 15-5, Mary
Washington 15-7, 15-10, and
Ferrum 15-12, 15-3. Overall, the
Generals are now 2-5, 1-0 in
conference play.

Head coach Susan Dittrnan

partially attributed these losses to
illness of some of the Generals’ key
players last week.

Said Dittman, “We’ve had a
hard time coming together after
losing three starting seniors from
last year. The team has performed
well enough up until this past week,
and now, the loss of senior
leadership seems to be a factor.”

The team’s goals for the
remainder of the season will be
directed towards good performances
in ODAC competition, said Dittrnan.

As of press time, the scorelof
the Generals’ game at Bridgewater
on Wednesday night had not come
in.

The Generals’ will be in action
on Thursday at Mary Baldwin, and
over the weekend at the Washington

Washington and Lee
women's soccer team continued to
play at a level above last year,
which is where head coach Jan
Hathom wants her team to be. But
despite strong play, the Generals
came out of last week with just a
tie to show for their efforts.

Although the Generals suffered a
3-0 loss to Old Dominion Athletic
Conference opponent Roanoke and
battled North Carolina Wesleyan to
a 0-0 tie, the scores were not
indicative of their play.

Playing in Salem last Friday
against Roanoke, the Generals got
off to a slow start. Roanoke scored
three times in the first thirty-five
minutes of play before W&L put
things together, but were unable to
dent the Maroons' defense.

Said Hathom, “After the first
thirty minutes, we got in the game
and shut them down. Sarah Allen [a
senior] had an amazing game — she
played great.”

Although the Generals battled
North Carolina Wesleyan to a tie,
the Generals felt they had outplayed
the Bishops and won every facet of
the game, except the score.

According the Hathom, her team
played “the best soccer we have
ever played.” W&L’s only problem
was that they couldn’t dent the
scoreboard. The Generals out-shot
N.C. Wesleyan 35-22.

The Generals, 2-4-2, will next
take to the ﬁeld on Saturday at
11:30 am. W&L will entertain
ODAC foe Randolph—Macon
Woman’s College, a team that
defeated the Generals earlier this
year.

The Ring-tum Phl, October 5, 1989

By Lee Fleming
Staff Reporter

Mountain Bicycles, the newest
addition to the world of cycling, are
rolling strong in Rockbridge County.

The mountain bicycle combines
a lightweight design and multiple
gears with an upright sitting posi-
tion.

“The mountain bike owner en-
joys tlie best of both worlds,” said
Andy Hunter, 14-year owner of the
Lexington Bicycle Shop. “It com-
bines an ease of riding with an ease
of operation.”

Hunter said the mountain bicycle
traces its history back to the late
1970's when a group of friends in
northern California spent their lei-
sure time riding their motorcycles
on mountain trails. These trails,
however, were eventually closed to
motorized traffic.

Rather than completely abandon
their hobby, the friends adapted. In-
stead of motorcycles, they began

using heavyweight bicycles on their
mountain rides.

“From there, it became just a
matter of one—upmanship,” said
Hunter. “Everyone would improve
his bike. One guy would get better
brakes, then another guy would get
better tires, et cetera. Eventually,
from this, the modern mountain bike
sprang.”

In 1978, the first ten mountain
bicycles for retail sale were built by
a California bicycle maker named
Joe Breeze. All sold quickly and
more were soon requested.

By 1982, Ross Bicycles became
the first manufacturer to come out
with a line of ‘mountain bikes.’
Others soon followed.

Today, Hunter says, all of the
major bicycle manufacturers have at
least 3 models of mountain bicycles
on the market.

Hunter says that mountain bicy-
cles have accounted for about forty
percent of his business over the last
year. Of those customers, he says,

most fall into the 15-30 year-old
age bracket.

“Those are the people who want
to ride on a variety of terrains on a
bike that's forgiving of mistakes,”
said Hunter. “On a mountain bike,
you don’t need sharp skills to cruise
down House Mountain, or to plow

through a muddy field."

Tee Teague, a Washington and
Lee senior from Roanoke, agrees.

“I used to have a 10-speed, but
it was too boring. My mountain
bike lets me see more of Lexington.
It’s more fun riding through the
woods.”

On the more serious side, Teague
and four other W&L students will
participate this Sunday in the Fall
Foliage Classic, a 20K mountain bi-
cycle race in Slatey Fork, W. Va.,
near Snowshoe.

Despite its name, however, the
mountain bicycle is still primarily
used for getting around.

From News Releases

Based in Raleigh, North Carolina, The Connells were
formed in 1984 when lead guitarist Mike Connell, then a law
student asked his younger brother David, a bass player to help
him start a band. An ad for a singer-attracted among others
a budding young swimming instructor, Doug MacMillan who
had never sung before, but thought it might be fun. He was
picked to be The Connells frontman, and is still somewhat
surprised to ﬁnd himself the lead singer of a band. They
were soon joined by Peele Quest. Several weeks later, the

lineup became complete when George Huntley, a fan of The '

Connells and frontman for his own bank, joined them on
guitar, keyboard and vocals. Mike and George remain the
primary lyricists and composers of The Connells unique and
powerful guitar—driven music.

in 1984 The Connells landed a track on North Carolina's
Dolphin Records sampler, which caught the attention of many
producers, including Don Dixon. He later became the produc-
er of The Connells first LP Darker Days released on Black
Park Records in 1986. Darker Days introduced their unique
sound to an enthusiastic audience and critical praise came
thick and fast on both sides of the Atlantic for this young
North Carolina quintet. Darker Days was released on British
Demon Records (co—owncd by Elvis Costello) in the UK.

Later that year, Let's Active frontman and producer Mitch
Easter was blown away by The Connells‘ New Years eve
'-1.986 showcase, and immediately offered to produce their next
album at his Drive—ln Studios. The ﬁnished album, Boyian
."leigr'it.$ was soon scooped by TVT Records and released in

By Jennifer Brandowskl
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee's Greek
organizations have exciting plans
for Homecoming, from cocktails
and band parties to tailgates and
pig roasts.

On Saturday there are’ a

variety of events planned. SPE
will be having a brunch and
Kappa Sigma is having a tailgate
by the Liberty Hall ruins before
the football game.
Chi Omega and Kappa
Alpha Theta are also having a
tailgate picnic before the game.
“We’re really excited to do
something with Chi—O...it’ll be
fun and promote Panhellenic
unity," Theta Activities
Chairman Patsy Sciutto said.

Chi-O is also planning a
“pre-party" later in the
afternoon at Treasurer Cammie
Seymour’s house. “We're
looking forward to our first big
event of the season and are
looking ‘forward to seeing our
alumni,” Chi-0's Special Events
Chairman Dale Wyatt said.

Saturday aftemoon The Truly
Dangerous Swamp Band will be
playing for Phi Kapp and SAE
behind the Phi Kapp house.
According to SAE sophomore
Will Thomas, “Everybody here

According to Fiji President

from Atlanta that played in the
Pit last year. We should have a.

basement downstairs and Split
Decision playing upstairs.” Their
festivities will continue on
Sunday with brunch and
cocktails. “We're expecting a
large turnout by the W&L

female group," Ladd said.

Sororities elect reps

 

By Kelly McCabe
Staff Reporter

 

Despite some initial dis-
agreement, all three Washington
and Lee sororities will have
Homecoming Queen nominees
this weekend.

In September, each sorority
received a letter from Associate
Alumni Secretary James D.
Farrar Jr. inviting them to elect
Homecoming Queen
representatives.

“I was nominated before I
knew it," said Kimberly Booth,
Kappa Alpha Theta's representa-

_Brock, the general

tive.

Booth said Theta's reaction
to their invitation to have a
nominee was quite positive.

Kappa Kappa Gamma had
not decided to elect a
r;=_.n;sentative as_of last week,
according to Kappa President
Heather Brock.

When the idea was brought
up in a chapter meeting, said
consensus
was to elect a male
representative for Homecoming
King instead. That idea was
discarded, Brock‘ said, because
they would have been the only
sorority with it male

representative.

Brock said Kappa chose a
nominee, junior Linsley Hunt,
because the other two sororities
had already elected
repersentatives.

Although most of the female
students have expressed that they
support the idea of sorority
Homecoming representatives, the
male students seem to have
mixed feelings.

Heather Brock said she has
heard one fraternity member
describe the idea as “stupid,"
but added that Hunt's escort,

Who chooses the queen?

By Brian Root
Senior Copy Editor

Why will everyone show for
only the first half of the football
game this weekend? That's easy.
Everyone wants to see who gets
kissed by Prof. Keith Shillington
at halftime — the traditional
honor accorded Washington and
Lee’s Homecoming Queen.

This year, however, student
interest is a little more intense
titan usual. Last fall, for the first
time, the Homecoming court was
made up exclusively of W&L
students. The reaction from those
in attendance last year was
somewhat hostile.

So, the question arises, is the
committee which selects the
Homecoming Queen biased in

favor of W&L students?

“There would probably be an
unconscious tendency to give a
little more attention to someone
you know in any interview,"
said Prof. Clark Mollenhoff, the
chairman of this year’s
committee. “Of course, everyone
will try to not have a bias in
our selection. We're open to any
young lady who impresses us.”

Mollenhoff said the
committee, which also includes
Prof. Alfred Fralin, Carol
Calkins, and Helena Roller, will
be looking for someone who is
both “physically and
intellectually beautiful.”

“I certainly don't want
anyone who is empty-headed
representing the school at

Homecoming," said Mollenhoff.
Mollenhoff said if the

senior Chris Giblin, “doesn't
seem to mind."
organizations that elect

candidates object to the eventual
selection, the responsibility is
theirs.

“We don't select the
candidates," said Mollenhoff.
“All we do is pick who we
think is the best from what we
have to work with.”

This year, also for the first
time, W&L‘s three sororities
have chosen candidates for
Homecoming Queen, despite the
misgivings of many members.

“I think it's a line idea,"
Mollenhoff said. “The women
probably know each other better
than anyone else might."

There’s only one way to ﬁnd
out how this year's selection
goes. Go out to the football
game — at least the first half.

Go Generals!

1940 Washington and Lee
graduate Lea Booth has attended
Homecoming for nearly half a
century.

Renirnirig for this annual
event, the alumnus and former
Director of Public Relations of
W&L looks forward to seeing
college friends. Often, however,
he is disappointed by modest
alumni attendance. “This may
be because of the broad
geographical scatteration of the
W&L alumni," he said. “It's
not like a local or state-oriented
college where a high percentage
of alumni are not far from the
campus and have only short
distances to travel in returning to
alma mater.”

The Ring-tum Phl Homecoming Supplement, October 5, 1989

Alumnus returns for

Booth, a Lynchburg resident,
enjoys the drive over the
mountain to what he calls “the
nation's most picturesque
campus.” On several occasions,
Booth and a group of Lynchburg
alumni have organized a bus trip
to the Homecoming football
game.

“This is usually when the
Generals‘ opponent is a well-
known rival such as Harnpden-
Sydney or Sewanee," Booth
said. This year, however, he
added, “I invited a local
alumnus to drive over to
Lexington with me to see the
game, and he asked, ‘But who is
Maryville?' ' '

Booth said he plans to attend
the football game. He will be
joined by his twin sons, George
and Cary, Class of 1980, the

 

seventh generation of their
mother's family to attend
Washington and Lee. Booth said
he is hoping for a Homecoming
victory and a chance to relive
his college days.

Booth would especially like
to see his freshman roommate,

 

49th year

Dick Boisseau.

“Dick was captain of the
football team and was selected
to the Associated Press All-
American team that year. But it
was the ﬁrst time the University
_of Virginia had beaten the
Generals in years, and that sad
event occurred at Homecoming."

Booth said he remembers
Home—coming weekends marked
by school spirit and tradition
during his college days. He said
Friday night pep rallies in
Doremus Gymnasium were
attended by almost the entire
student body. Cy Young, alumni
secretary and basketball coach,

would give the traditional
exhortation to “beat those damn
Wahoos!” This became the
students’ battle cry when playing
long—time rival UVa.

Booth said he also re-
members the spirited fraternity
houses adorned with streamers
and clever signs. After the game
the fraternities would have
parties and dances that Booth
said were “always well-chaper-
oned by our house-mothers.”

“The brothers and their
guests were always wcll—be-
haved, of course," he added.
“Well, most of the time."

According to Booth, the most
memorable Homecoming was in
1951. when the Generals beat
UVa.

“The score was 42-14, and
my ‘date,’ a young Sweet Briar
graduate, and I were so
exhilarated by that glorious
victory that we became engaged
at a post—game party and were
married three months later.”

Shillington returns to glory for 27th time

By Todd Peppers
Staff Reporter

There are certain aspects of
Washington and Lee that take on
a timeless quality: the coloririade
in autumn, the quiet dignity of
Lee Chapel, and the serene
Virginia hills. The farriiliar
campus often overwhelms
returning alumni, and it ﬁlls
them with echoes of their distant
undergraduate days. Yet there is
another facet of Washington ’?ld
Lee history and tradition that
propels alumni back into the
past--Keith Shillington crowning
the homecoming queen during
halftime.

Chemistry professor Keith
Shillington cannot remember a
homecoming where he wasn't
occupying center stage on the
ﬁfty yard line. He thinks his
first homecoming was over
twenty-ﬁve years ago. Calyx
records first record Professor
Shillington's presence at
homecoming in the fall of 1963.

Not only was Shillington
crowning homecoming queens
before most Washington and Lee
students were born, but he can
make the legitimate claim to be
the first ever to assume the role.

"As far as I know, I started
at the beginning, said
Shillington. "When they started
having a homecoming queen,
they asked me that year to
crown her."

When asked if he was the
first Washington and Lee
professor to ever crown a
homecoming queen, Shillington
wisely said "If I say that,
someone will dig up an oldie
and a goldie. There apparently
have been queens like May
queens and so forth, but the idea
of having a homecoming queen
was new. As far as I know, I
started the idea [for the
ceremony's proccdurel."

Since Shillington was the
first professor to crown the
queen, he did not have any any
guidelines or traditions to follow.
He was forced to literally invent
the unique halftime event.
Shillington feels that it was his
acting abilities :',1at made him
the man f:.-r the part.

"One of the reasons why I
was asked [to create the event]
was because I was in the
theater, I had played Malvolio in
‘Twelfth Night.’ The chances of
being in the chemistry
department and doing it
[homecoming] aren't very good;
it was very apt to be die english
or history departments since
there are more students."
Shillington drew upon his drama
experiences to create the
ceremony.

According to Shillington, the
crowning ceremony has not
changed dramtically over the
years. He used to sit in the
stands for the first half before
walking down to the ﬁeld at
halftime. Knee surgery now
prevents Shillington from sitting
in the stands. Current
Washington and Lee students are

accustomed to the sight of’

Professor Shillington roaring
onto the football ﬁeld in a golf
cart. One can always tell by the
crowd's reaction that Shillington
has arrived.Last year he zoomed
into Wilson stadium with a huge
tic strearriing behind him.

"I wore a big tie that said
"vote" on it," said Shillington.
"This year I am going to wear a
big long tie because they [the
students] are all yelling about it.
I have got about ﬁve of those
long ties that various kids have
given me."

Shillington will not have to
search long to ﬁnd a particularly
striking tie for this homecoming.
At one time Professor Jefferson
Davis Futch III was not the only
teacher on campus famous for
his fondness of ties. The ties
are simply one part of the
"clown role" that Shillington
says he plays as part of the
Washington and Lee's
homecoming "folk-lore."

"I used to have an October
tic festival where I wore a
sleazy tie, a new one, every day
of October. The strawberry
yellow is an awfully big
favorite, it isn't long, though. I
have a long tie that I think will
make the grade."

When a.':!;;'.d about the
changes in over the years,
Shillington agreed that
horrigcolrriing is another facet of

 

Dr. Keith Shillington, dressed to the toes, is the traditional kiss(right). Shillington said “l
seen announcing(left) the 1988 Homecoming didn't ﬁnd any difference in crowning a W&L
Queen Stacy Patmor and crowning her before girl." File photo.

our campus that maintains its
aura of timelessncss. In his
eyes the events on the ﬁeld
remain constant. But there are
changes off the ﬁeld.

"There used to be pep-rallies
on Friday night. We tried
crowning the queen one Friday
night instead of at the game, and
that was an absolute, total error.
It just didn't work."

Of course one change in the
traditional homecoming
ceremonies is the Washington
and Lee women who now
compete for the crown.
Shillington was present at the
historic occasion when Catherine
Christian was the first
Washington and Lee student
crowned queen. Last fall,
Washington and Lee junior Stacy
Patmore became the second.

"I didn't find any difference
in crowning Washington and Lee
girls. They have all been ﬁne."

Shillington predicted that a
future dilemma might serve to
alter the twenty—six year old
homecoming style. "The real
problem is coming because the
sororities are wanting to select a
king," he said. "And it might
be alright, I’m just about retired

completely." Shillington doesn't
know what would happen if
there one day there was a
homecoming king, but remarked
"I guess I could serve as master
of ceremonies. I can crown her,
but can I crown him? We are
inventing."

One aspect of the event that
always remains constant is
Shillington's famous, or
infamous, homecorriing kiss.
When asked if he knew how the
women felt about the christening
kiss, he said "I really don't
know. Most of them are very
warm and affectionate. I have
had very few girls who didn't
seem to be enjoying it. The
ﬁrst year, I had to keep it [the
kiss] very, very, very, very,
rigorous and straight-forward."

Junior Stacy Patmore, the
1988-1989 homecoming queen,
was asked about her reaction to
the Shillington kiss. "I was a
little nervous about it, but the
kiss wasn't that bad. It is just
pan of the tradition and
homecoming wouldn't be the
same without the kiss."

Finally, on the subject of the
homecoming kiss, Shillington
said that "what I do the kids
adore." Yet he doesn't allow

the students’ adoration to his
head and he adtk, modestly, that
students also "adore cocacola."
Yet the traditional kiss always
seems to bring the biggest roar
from the stands as Professor
Shillington welcomes the queen
to her new reign.

Shillington thinks that some
students are confused about his
role in homecorriing. He is not
a judge. A committee is
responsible for judging the
candidates, and new panelists
were selected for this year's
committee. They are Carol
Calkins, Tidge Roller, Professor
Alfred Fralin, and Professor
Clark Mollenhoff. Shillington
explained why he no longer acts
as a judge.

"I judged for ﬁve years and
dined for ﬁfteen years with the
I(.A.'s." But he grew tired of
the uproar he endured each time
a K.A. queen was crowned and
decided to no longer act as a
judge.

As Shillington approaches his
twenty-seventh homecoming, he
could probably recount endless
tales of his experiences. When
asked about the most memorable
homecoming, Shillington offered

It's that Homecoming time of
year again. Everyone is rushing
to find a date and make plans.

And once the problem of
finding a date is taken care of,
then you have to decide what to
do. What to do, what to do?

Well, you and your date can
kick off the Homecoming week-
end with a quaint dinner for two
at one of Lexington’s fine
restaurants. Then there is always
the Friday Night Homecoming
Concert. This year, Lost in the
Supermarket and Flight of Mavis
will be opening up for The Con-
nells.

And after the concert, there
is always that tough choice of
which fraternity houses to go
visit to conclude the evening's
activities.

And that's just Friday night's
activities.

If you decide to drink, re-
member four things: have fun,
be responsible, and don't drink
and drive (A public service an-
nouncement paid for by your
local Sports Editor). And be able
to wake up the next morning in
time to go to the football game.

That's right, the football
game.

At 2:00 on Wilson Field, the
Generals will kick off the 1989
Homecoming game against
Maryville College. On Saturday
it will have been one year and
one day ago since the Generals
defeated the Scots 20-0 at Mary-
ville.

This game will be the fifth
time that the Generals and the
Scots have squared off in
W&L's Homecoming game.
Each team has won twice. In
1987, Maryville spoiled W&L's

Since 1955, the Generals are

With all-time winningest head

W&L has had some exciting

‘and outstanding performances in

Homecoming games of the past.
In 1987, Phillip Sampson com-
pleted 23 of 44 passes for 295
yards and two touchdowns in the
loss to Maryville. In 1985, wide
receiver Hugh Finkelstein caught
seven passes for 175 yards and
two touchdowns.

In 1984, quarterback Jon
Thornton completed 11 of 18
passes for 257 yards. 1983 saw
Gene Girard run for 170 yardr
on 17 carries. Girard was
W&L's first 1,000-yard nisher.
1982 provided one of the closest

history. Girard’s one—yard touch-
down run followed by a two-
point conversion pass from
quarterback John Thompson to
Chris Cavalline gave the Gener-
als a 20-19 win over Randolph-

While Washington and Lee students are
celebrating Homecoming this weekend, Live
Drive organizers and drivers will be working to
insure sober travel for the party-goers.

In addition to its regular Friday and Saturday
call-in service between 10 p.rn. and 2 a.m., Live
Drive Saturday night will provide a shuttle
service between all fraternity houses and the
Pavilion.

Live Drive Chairman John Fialcowitz said he
expects response to Live Drive's efforts to be
good this weekend and has requested another
van for the shuttle service. He said the vans are
usually packed to capacity and often run out of
space.

“The problem is that everybody goes out at
10 o'clock,” Fialcowitz said. “It'd be nice if
people would go out at different times, but
people don't work that way.”

He said he hopes people who live near the
campus will walk to the Pavilion.

Live Drive also offers an exclusive sober-
driver shuttle service to organizations that make
a request two weeks in advance and are willing
to chip in for gas. No fraternities or other
organizations, placed a request for this weekend,
Fialcowitz said. .

“People are just getting used to the idea of
calling in,"he said. “They're gradually realizing
that it's pretty convenient for them."

Calls are fielded by one of six Live Drive
coordinators stationed in the University Center.
Drivers must make periodic stops by the “home

in W&L W&L defense rose to the occa-

base“ for instructions before answering
requests ~ a process Live Drive Coordinators
think is inefficient.

Live Drive Secretary Stephen Mathis said the
committee hopes to eliminate the tirne-consurning
check-in stop by installing a communication
system in the vans that would enable
coordinators to communicate with drivers. He
said a system similar to a cellular phone will be
tested next week.

“The administration told us that this seems to
be important enough and that they are willing to
work with us to get what we want,” Mathis
said.

Part of the cost of the system, he added, will
probably be taken out of a personal grant that
President Wilson ‘ gave to the Executive
Committee for Live Drive.

Lexington Police Sergeant A.M. Miller said
the number of tickets issued to W&L students
for driving while intoxicated has decreased since
Live Drive began last year. “Now with Live
Drive," Miller said, “there's no reason for
W&L students to get a DUI.”

Fialcowitz said he would like talk to
authorities in other schools and help them start
their own sober-driver program.

“It might be worth bringing to their attention
because it's an issue {ha}. concerns both of us,”
he said.

Miller said he would also like to see Live
Drive offered to nearby girls schools, such as
Southern Seminary. _ ' . 4

sion, holding the Scots to half
their normal output in upsetting
them 14-12.

The Generals lost last sea-
son's Homecoming game in
heart-breaking fashion. A safety
on a bad snap and a hail-mary
touchdown pass at the end of
the first half proved to be the
difference as Hampden-Sydney
stopped W&L 22-20. When H-
SC comes to Lexington for
Homecoming, the Generals are
0-5-1.

Last year's disappointing loss
‘vi/as W&L's third straight in a
Homecoming game. No one on
this W&L squad has won a
Homecoming game. Said senior
defensive lineman Scott Sil-
verman, “This year’s seniors
have been talking about it all
this week, and we really want to
be able to say that we won a

 

me, too?

Homecoming game. The Monday
after losing a Homecoming game
is the worst Monday of the
year."

The last W&L Homecoming
win came back in 1985, when
the Generals routed Maryville
42-17 ‘scoring 35 points in the
second half.

There are some similarities
between this W&L team and the
Generals of 1985. The 1985
Generals featured a high scoring
offense led by a record—setting
quarterback. Jon Thornton, who
holds the records for most
touchdown passes in a game (4),
and most passing attempts in a
game (52), led the Generals to a
42-17 win.

Thomton completed 13 of 18
passes for 232 yards and four
touchdowns, and running back
Kevin Weaver ran 24 times for
108 yards and two touchdowns.
Weaver is W&L's second all-
time leading rusher.

The 1989 Generals have
scored 25 points in three of their
four games and are led by
record—setting quarterback Phillip
Sampson, who has set a W&L
record or passed a career mile-
stone in each of the four games
this season.

Another striking similarity
between the seasons is that after
W&L beat Maryville in 1985,
the Generals defeated Harnpdcn-
Sydney in the Squids' Home-
coming game 32-20.

After entertaining Maryville
this Saturday, the Generals will
travel to Hampden-Sydney for
the Tigers’ Homecoming game.

In 1985, the Generals tied
Emory and Henry and Randolph-
Macon for the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference title.

SHILLINGTON

from page 3

Everyone got -

  

the following story:

"The Betas one year were
going to dress up one of their
members in a dishmop and that
kind of thing. It wonied rrte for
a bit, how the hell was I going
to handle it if it happened?
That was orte homecoming that
stuck out in my ntind because it
was an awful worry for me."
Luckily for Shillington, the
studertt in drag didn't appear.

Homecoming is never trouble
free, as Shillington is quick to
note. Homecoming problems in
earlier times seemed to center
around the microphone.
Shillington jokingly added that
"it got to the point where I was
nearputonmybehindbythe
electricity on the microphone.
One year when the system was
rtot working well I tried a
megaphone. I can yell loud and
I'm distinct, but it didn't make
it very well."

Professor Shillington has
clearly not tired of the job.
When asked if he enjoys his role
after the many years, he replied
" h Lord yes, I look forward to
it.”

Being an actor is an essential
ingredient for the job, at least
for Shillington, and he used the
language_ of the theater to
describe his feelings about
homecoming. Shillington talked
Of initially having to overcome

stage-fright each time he looked
out upon a full stadium. But
Shillington thinks the role
quickly comes together once he
breaks the ice with his "opening
line."

He added that "the most
glorious moment for me is when
I turn to the microphone.
Before I say anything, I raise
my hands and I bring them all
[the studertts] up. Oh Jesus. I
love that. To have that resonance
between myself and the group in
the stands is what I get out of
it. The electricity is high...it is
theater."

Professor Shillington spoke
wistfully of a future beyond
retirement. He will retire after
the 1990-1991 school year.
Shillington does not what his
role will be in the homecomings
after he retires, and he added
that most students will not krtow
him someday. Stacy Patrnore
said simply that "Professor
Shillington is such an unique
part of homecoming, I can't
imagaine who would replace
him." Her feelings parallel the
thoughts of many past and
present Washington and Lee
students. Others would add to
Patmore's statement that no one
CAN \replace him. "Doc"
Shillington does not have to
worry, Washington and Lee
legends never fade away.

Square, then up Main Street to
Nelson. The students would
then take a right on Nelson and
break into the State theater for a,
free movie.

The parade must have been a
sight. At a time when the world
was not so serious, when
students weren’t spending their
college careers building resumes.
In 1955 the Phi ran a picture of
the parade. In the picture was a
group of students wearing
pajamas, one of them bearing a
placard reading, "Shove It Up a
Turkey - Gobble, Gobble."

13 days before Homecoming

the 13 Club would begin its
initiation period of its 13 new
pledges (who had paid their
initiation fee of $13.13) from 13
different fraternities. At some
point during these 13 days it
was usual for the statue of
Cyrus McCormick, the one
standing guard on front campus.
the one most visitors think is
Lee, was tarred and feathered,
and the base covered with
number 13’s.

Ah, what a fine time it must
have been.

Saturday of Homecoming
would usually begin with a
football game, that much hasn't
changed, but their Saturday night
a dance, called "Openings,",
would be held in a lavishly
decorated Doremus Gymnasium.

1 There would be decorations and

this is when the Homecoming
Queen would be crowned. The
Queen. We still have that, and
‘Dr. Shillington still kisses them.
How long has he been doing
that? It seems as if it started
back in the early 60’s, but he's
not sure and no one else is
either.

But of all those rich
traditions only two remain, the
Game and the Queen. Where did
it all go? Did they just quit?
Was some ban placed on 13's or
pajamas? No. Perhaps they
were killed by a war. They
mostly died out in the late 60’s,

running through the heads of
every young man. The last
mention, in the Phi, of a house
winning a decorations award was
Lambda Chi in 1969, and a
writer in that same issue wrote,
"It seems that for the most part,
an alumnus returning to carrrpus
is a lonely experience."

Irt 1970, the only mention
made in the Phi of Homecoming
was that it existed and there
would be a Concert Friday night
and the game Saturday followed
by a grain party in Red Square.
hi the 1955 Homecoming issue
of the Phi the E.C. stated that
its policy against drinking in
public would be strictly enforced
at that years game._ One of the
classes listed for a reunion in
1970 was the class of 1925.
Things had changed '

By 1971 the only mention of

.Homecoming after the fact was

a small picture, in the lower left
hand comer of the front page, of
Shillington kissing the Queen.
But Washington and Lee was
never a big school. Never a
school with teeming thousands

cheer the Generals and so things
will change. But there are some
things here that will never
change. On that first Homecming
day, back in 1925, G.I_-I. Denny,
fonner president of Washington
and Lee, spoke to the alumni.
"Take away from many a
college its ertdowmertt a.nd what
is left?" said Denny, "But strip
the Washington and Lee Campus
of every building and every
dollar, and there are left some
things more precious than silver
and gold." I'm glad that hasn't
changed.

months The record went on to garner praise from such
mainstream press staples as Rolling Stone and Musician.

Along with the release of Boylan Heights, The Cormells
embarked on their first rtationwide tour, eaming them many
new fans outside of the South. Their "wholesome boy”
appeal and college popularity continuously gain them thousand
of offers to play homecoming gigs and {rat parties, as they
remain cool enough to repeatedly sell out 1500 seat venues
and hold all-time attendance records in any number of clubs
throughout the country. The Cormells were quickly earning a
name for themselves in the music industry.

As they toured through-out the year, The Cormells began
work on their third LP, Fun & Games and hired producer
Gary Sntith, known best for his work with The Pixies and
Throwing Muses. Gary set out to make Fun & Game: an
even more accurate reflection of The Connells‘ live show.
“Gary wanted to get some of the punch that we have live into
the recording," claims lead-singer Doug MacMillan. Fun 4!

lodged the Conrtells in the top 10 on every Modern Rock

front of the music scene, and once again wins The Comells

 WiIson calls W&L’s fraternities ‘vitally important’

By Brian Root
Senior Copy Editor

The Fraternity Renaissance
program, in which Washington and
Lee will spend about $10 million to
renovate many of the 16 fraternity
houses, is intended to preserve
W&L’s fraternities, not to eliminate
them, said W&L President John D.

Wilson in a speech at Tuesday
night ’ s lnterfratemity Council
meeting.

“The fraternities at W&L are,

.without question, the most active

examined

By Cathy Lopiccolo
Staff Reporter

The Health Education Committee
will be sponsoring a series of events
next week to mark National
Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week,
according to W&L senior Nancy
Hickam, co-chairman of the
Committee.

“(We want) to get people to be
aware of the effects of alcohol and
how much they drink,” Hickarn
said. “A lot of people don't realize
they have a problem with alcohol or
how much they depend on it.”

The first event planned by the
committee is a banner contest on

the weeks theme of “Absolut
Awareness," taken from the brand
of liquor,‘ said senior Carter
Montague, the committee’s other
cliaiiman. The residence halls will
be making the banners for

“The banners are supposed to be
done on this Friday and judged. The
winning hall gets an ice cream party
or a pizza party, and their banner
will be hung somewhere on campus
during next week,” Hickam said.

who served as Deputy Chief of
Staff under former President Ronald
Reagan, will speak in Lee Chapel.

institutions,” said Wilson. “This
school has a lot of conﬁdence and a
lot at stake in the leadership the
fraternities provide.”

The only setback for the
program thus far, Wilson said, are
cost overruns.

“We had been hoping to keep
the renovation within our original
cost estimates,” Wilson said.
“Unfortunately, the first four houses
are running about 30 percent over
cost.”

The current poor quality of the
houses is related to what Wilson
called “the general decline of the
fraternity movement." Since the late

more as just outlets for parties, and
so the general quality of fraternity
leadership began to decline.

“In the last few years, however,
we're seeing more and more interest
on the part of both students and
alumni in returning the fraternities
to their former quality,” Wilson

I said.

Wilson said the trend was
particularly apparent at W&L.

SAB rules revised;

BGCOUHIS

By Brooke Jzirabek
Staff Reporter

The Executive Committee has
revised the ﬁnancial procedures of
the Student Activities Board after
the SAB amassed a $26,000 deficit
for fiscal year 1988-1989.

To do this, the EC broke the
SAB budget into two parts instead
of giving the SAB one lump sum as
it had in the past. The Fancy Dress
Ball fund has been separated from
the SAB general fund. The general

’ fund of S40,0()0 was further sepa-

rated iiito funds for Fall ($15,000),
Winter (Sl5,()l)()), and Spring
(Sl(),()(l0).

The EC also eliminated all SAB
charge accounts. All SAB pur-
chases must now go through the
Business Office. The SAB will
have to get a check from the Busi-
ness Olifiec for a predetermined
amount of money and then cash it
in order to purchase ice, cups and
any other supplies.

“This will prevent charges from

closed

coming in late and prevent not giv- ,

ing an accurate account of where
money has been spent," according
to EC President Willard Dumas.
He said the new procedure will give
the EC a more accurate account of
expenditures as well as “requiring
SAB to plan and organize better."
“The SAB considered it a personal
attack when [the EC] cut their bud-
get, but the budgets of all the other
campus organizations were also
cut,” Dumas said.

The number of organizations to
which the EC goves funds has in-
creased from about 5 or 6 two years
ago to about 25 this year, said Du-
mas. The student activities fee that
each student pays yearly to provide
funds for these student groups has
increased by only $5 in that time.

Dumas said the EC will seek the
approval of the Board of Trustees to
increase the yearly student activity
fee by at least $10. “If we don't
raise the fee,” he said, “we'll be in
the same position next year."

Hitz will chair Fancy Dress

Accepts higher position after last week's resignation

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

The Executive Committee ap-
pointed Alex Hitz as the new Fancy
Dress chairman less than a week
after Hit’/. resigned as Fancy Dress
vice chairman. Will Jones, who had
not applied for a position on the
Fancy Dress committee in the first
interviews, was named the new vice
chairinini.

Hitz resigned from his position
as vice chair after Richard Spence
was appointed chairman. Spence
also resigned from his position say-
ing the SAB was willing to cooper-
ate with him only if he played by
their rules. He could not accept
their rules and quit because, he said,

. .:.«

his hands “were tied from the
start.”

Hitz, who had applied for the
position of chairman while Spence
had applied for the position of audi-
tor, resigned because he believed he
was more qualiﬁed to be Fancy
Dress Chairman then Spence, al-
though Spence had similar organiza-
tional experiences in high school.
Hitz also said he would accept a
position other than chairman only if
he could work with the chairman.

EC President Willard Dumas
said Hitz was the only applicant for
the position because "the job has
gotten so big it scares students
away." '

After Spence resigned, declaring
the SAB would not cooperate with

him, Dumas said "the picture was
painted throughout the student body
that a lot of people on the SAB and
a lot of people in school have set
notions as to how the job of chair-
man is to be run and what is ex-
pected."

He added students may think
"those people aren't willing to bend
those expectations, so a lot of stu-
dents don’t want to come into a po-
sition" where the supporting people
refuse to change their ideas.

Dumas said the EC is attempting
to change the chairrnan’s job de-
scription and encourage the three
officers to share the burden because
the responsibility is too big for one
person to handle alone.

students has risen back to about 90
percent, and the old attitude about
fraternities has begun to change.

“You students have inherited a
system that’s been in decline for
almost 20 years,” Wilson said.
“Frankly, the shape of your houses
reflects that, but you are the people
who can change it.”

Wilson assured the fraternities
the school is committed to insuring
the fraternities’ survival, through the
renovation program.

“Fraternities have been
since before the Civil War,”

Wilson. “I think we can agree that
fraternities are too important to just

let them slip away.”
Wilson said many other colleges,

such as Williams College and
Amherst College, reacted to
mounting liability problems with
fraternities by simply eliminating
them. ‘

Other colleges, such as
Dartmouth, imposed tight new
restrictions on fraternities without

offering to help the houses attain
them, thus effectively sentencing the
houses to extinction, Wilson said.
“It was almost as if they were
hoping the fraternities would fail,”
Wilson said. “But here, the
students, alumni, trustees, and even

Walsh

most of the faculty have said
fraternities are too important to let
them go by the wayside.”

The goals of the program go far

beyond simply rebuilding the
houses, Wilson said.
“Fraternities were once

considered homes where one could
select the people he could work
with, party with, and grow to
maturity with,” said Wilson. “Now,
they’re seen as just a party pavilion.
We're hoping to see that change."

The renovation program is set to
begin this summer, when work will
begin on four houses.

for A.D. post

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

Wednesday afternoon, Washing-
ton and Lee announced that Michael
Walsh will become the school’s

next athletic director effective Dec.‘

1.

“l was impressed with every-
thing I saw when I came down to
visit,” said Walsh. “I got the im-
pression that the athletic program
was healthy. I was impressed with
the professionalism and enthusiasm
that the coaches showed toward
both their teams and their teaching
jobs.”

Walsh becomes the fifth athletic
director in W&L’s history. He re-
places William McHenry, who re-
signed over the summer.

Walsh comes to W&L from
Dartmouth College, where he served
as head baseball coach and assistant
athletic director since 1981.

Said Walsh, “I’m very excited,
and my family is very excited about
coming to Lexington."

Said W&L president John Wil-
son, “We are delighted that Mr.
Walsh and his family have accepted
our offer to join the Washington
and Lee community. We look for-
w.ii'd to his leadership, gained
through his years of experience as a
coach and an administrator.

“He comes from an Ivy League

 

Michael Walsh

school with the balance of academ-
ics and athletics in the proper pro-
spective. He understands otir situa-
tion and will be able to provide us
with fresh views that someone from
outside the community can bring."

His specific duties at Dartmouth
centered around event management,
budgeting, marketing and NCAA
compliance. Walsh, 41, was also
part of a management team that iri-
stituted a five-year plan for improv-
ing the quality of Dartmouth‘s com-
petitive sports program. Within four
years, the plan produced Dart-
month's best won-lost record in 27
years.

Smith: debt paid for image

By Cecily Tynan
Staff Reporter

Although bills are still being
paid for last year’s Fancy Dress, the
improved ‘image’ of the Student
Activities Board is worth it, accord-
ing to 1989 Fancy Dress Chairman
Liz Smith.

“We knew image of it — how
the students perceived SAB -— was
the most important thing to get back
on track and then you can correct
the money problems when people
are willing to pay the money," said
Smith.

Last year was an interim period
for the student organization, accord-
ing to Smith, and was “definitcly"
worth the resulting budgetary prob-
lerns.

“We knew it was going to take
a year, maybe two, to get the stu-
dents psyched to go to an SAB
function," said Smith.

The financial headaches of last
year’s Fancy Dress stemmed from
the Thursday night B.B. King con-
cert, which

“We had a huge name for

The Connells played the Pavilion Friday night of

Thursday night and you just can’t
support that," said Smith.

No records exist, however, of
exactly how much money was lost
since the receipts for Thursday
night’s ticket sales and tickets for
Friday’s ball were never separated.

Smith said the Friday night
Fancy Dress Ball initially made
money for the SAB. This was true
originally, according to a budget
report sent to the Executive Com-
mittee immediately after Fancy
Dress. That report showed receipts
approximately $2,000 over costs.
That figure, however, failed to con-
sider bills yet to come in, said
Smith.

Incoming Fancy Dress bills con-
tinue to create pressures for this
year’s SAB. The latest bill — more
than $800 from Rose's — arrived
just this past Tuesday, according to
this year’s SAB. Treasurer Katie
Duwel.

“Even to this day, we don't
know what was actually spent be-
cause we don’t know what bills are
yet to come in,” said Duwel.

The unorganized handling of
money was the biggest problem

with last year’s SAB, according to
Smith.

“We had so much money going
through our hands last year, more
than we had ever, because we
brought in more money. We had
bigger entertainment and bigger bud-
gets,” said Smith.

Smith blames last year’s SAB
treasurer Mike Carroll for not keep-
ing accurate records of the charges
and future bills. “There should
have been a ledger kept, but we've
been looking and we can't find it,”
said Smith.

Smith says she handed the bills
to Carroll and expected him to keep
the records.

“The treasurer is supposed to be
on top of things...I had a million
other things to do,” said Smith.
Smith said her requests for a sepa-
rate FD account were tumed down
both last year and the year before.

“What the FD chairman needs is
a secretary. Perhaps the
establishment of a Fancy Dress au-
ditor this year will help," said
Smith.

  OPINION

Lexington tries .

a new tax dance

The personal property tax in the city of Lexington is 5.5
percent. To put it in more graphic terms, if a Washington
and Lee student were made to pay this tax on a brand-new
BMW 325i convertible, the bill would come to $1,950.

Lexington is, as its leaders like to say, “financially
stressed.” Because the city is restricted from expanding,
Lexington has few ways to expand its tax income. Thus was
born the notion to tax student cars. After all, don't students
park their cars here nine months out of each year? Don't
they use city streets and take advantage of city services? 30
they should pay the same tax as year—round residents, right.‘

Wrong.

The reason is simple. It's not legal. The issue hinges on
the distinction between in-state and out—of-state students. For

out—of-state students who pay property taxes back home,s

there seems to be no question. Section 58.1-3511 of the state
code says, “Any person domiciled in another state whose
motor vehicle is principally parked in this Commonwealth
during the tax year shall not be subject to a personal
property tax on such vehicle upon showing of sufficient
evidence that such person has paid a personal property tax
on the vehicle in the state in which he is domiciled.” The
statute goes on to say that a “similar tax” in the car
owner’s home state will make him exempt.

In the next paragraph, the law says someone who has paid
a personal property tax in Virginia and a “similar tax” in
his home state “may apply to such city or county for a
refund of such tax payment.” I ,

Lexington City Manager Joseph King, in a letter to The
Ring-tum Phi, said, in his opinion, that meant students could
be made to pay the difference between Lexington’s tax rate
and that of the student's home state. l

That assessment, we believe, is faulty. Every state, as well
as the federal government, provides for refunds of excess tax
payments. Accidents happen. Every year, many people pay
taxes for which they are not obligated. If such cases, they
can apply for a refund of the unnecessary payment. i‘

That appears to be the case here. If a student were to pay
an urmecessary tax to the city of Lexington, the law provides
him with a means to get a refund, not the city with a means
to tax students twice for the same property. I

Although the law does not seem to address in-state
students, we believe the doctrine of fairness obligates the
city to exempt in-state students from the personal property
tax as well. Is it fair to subject in-state students to what
amounts to two personal property taxes? Lexington’s rate is
the highest in the state, so every in-state student would pay
at least a fraction of that 5.5 percent. Also, is it fair to tax
in-state students while those students who have, by accident
of birth, escaped Virginia residency are exempted?

King said Lexington is waiting for the city attorney to
deliver an opinion on the matter. There is no need to wait.
The law is clear. Lexington will have to look elsewhere.

Lee remembered

One century and nineteen years ago this morning, Gen.
Robert E. Lee, then the president of this college, died. He
was remembered earlier today in a memorial service in the
chapel that bears his name.

During President George Bush's visit to Charlottesville last
month, the then—president of the University of Virginia,
Robert O'Neill, pointed out that Thomas Jefferson is
mentioned at least every two hours on the UVa campus.
“There are worse habits,” he observed.

The same is perhaps often said of Lee here: Why must we
praise him constantly? Weren’t their two founders? And
didn’t anyone else do anything for W&L?

The answer, of course, is yes. But there is a reason why
we remember Lee so fondly and so often. Perhaps Maj. John
W. Daniel explained it best, when he spoke at the unveiling
ceremony for the statue that rests in Lee Chapel:

Here for ﬁve years the General devoted himself to the
cause of education, and here under him that cause nobly
ﬂourished. Here he demonstrated that comprehensive grasp of
every subject connected with his sphere; and the keen
apprehension of the demands of this progressive age, and of
a land entering as it were upon a new birth. His associates in
the faculty loved him as a father, and all who saw or knew
his work with common voice proclaimed the conviction
expressed by one of the most distinguished of his associates,
that he was ”the best College President that this country has
ever produced."

Lee. General, educator, gentleman. Remember him. There
are worse habits. I

Students accuse EC of budget bias}.

MY VIEW

By Gary McCullough
and Aelica Ingenthron

What is the purpose of a stu-
dent—run Executive Committee? If
there is any point in having such a
committee at a liberal arts school,
then it seems logical that such a
committee would promote the same
kind of atmosphere that is condu-
cive to a liberal arts education - an
education which, under ideal circ-
urnstances, promotes an open ex-
change of ideas for the benefit of
none other than those who have the
courage to exchange them. So, con-
sidering the importance of such a
committee, if there is any doubt as
to whether the committee is per-
forming to the best of its capabili-
ties, then such a doubt must be ad-
dressed immediately. For, if the
committee fails to do this then it
betrays not only itself, but the stu-

organization"? The impression
which I gathered from their com-
ments was that a political organiza-
tion is anything which “personally
offen " any one of the EC’s mem-
bers. Rest assured that if I were a
member of the EC and had the right
to make my decision in the same
manner, then the Liberty Hall Vol-
unteers sure as hell wouldn't have
received $900 which they were allo-
cated for the year. After all, I
would have made my decision pure-
ly on that which I found offensive.
And what could be more‘ offensive
than a group of southern college
students marching around in Con-
federate uniforms? Didn't the Mi-
nority Student Association boycott

Fancy Dress two years ago on the
basis that the same theme had’ racist
cormotations?

The point of this is not to attack
the Liberty Hall Volunteers, but to
attack the principle by which The
EC denied Amnesty International, a
committee which is designed to pro-
mote human rights, their fair share
of the EC’s central funding. I, per-
sonally, would have rather seen that
$900 go toward saving prisoners of
conscience. However, my opinion
does not count - not because my
opinion is not important, but appar-
ently because I am not a member of
the EC. Even the W&L student
handbook classiﬁes Amnesty Inter-
national separately from the political

organizations.

One might assume that bias is,
entering into my interpretation of
the EC’s decision-making process. '

However, I am basing my argu— I
ment solely on what I was told at
the meeting, which can be summekii
up well by EC Rep. David Antho- ‘
ny, who said, “I personally find
your organization offensive." 'Well, 0
all I have to say to that person is
that I find YOUR organization quite '
offensive. But who cares what ei- I
ther of us think? - the point is that
the student body has to live with ’
what he thinks, not with what It
think. Even the United States
government has a system of checks ‘
and balances. Think about that! ' ,.

D

on

women being offended by the theme. It was
just that — a theme!

Secondly, responding to last week's car-
toon depicting a W&L guy dressed up as a
W&L girl for Homecoming Queen: I don't
understand why W&L women winning Home-
coming Queen should create a fuss. It should
be that way. A Hollins/Sweetbriar, etc. girl
winning W&L Homecoming Queen is like an
Australian girl winning Miss America because
"she speaks English and visits America a lot."

complaint to the Executive Committee for what
I consider
behavior on. the part of both individuals on the
EC4and the EC as a whole. I do want it to be

would imagine, following so disastrous an
interview, that there were many that probably
did not even read my application with any
particular care. This is a practice which defeats
the entire purpose of the written application.

As well, this procedure shows great
disrespect to the applicant and, quite frankly,
an incredible amount of gall on the part of the
members of the EC to assume any position of
authority in the decision-making process, given
the unpreparedness of the committee members
and the inequity with which the applicant was
treated. For this procedure does not take into
account the confidence and eloquence so well
expressed on paper but lost in the transition to
speech in front of a panel of thirteen members
by a nervous applicant to a position that does
not require such eloquence in speech.

My second complaint is to an individual on
the EC, second-year law Rep. Mark Cobb. It is
directed at a question asked of me by Mr.
Cobb after my formal dismissal from the
interview by Mr. Dumas. It was a question
that, so phrased and so timed," could do
nothing but to further the detriment of my
interview.

Student asks:
is SAB lying?’

Last week I paused over two words that
appeared in Richard Spence's editorial on his
SAB experience. The words were “creative
bookkeeping" quoted from Alexander Hitz.
What does this mean? According to Spence,
they represent “fraud, mismanagement, and 
lies.”

If what Spence asserts is true, have
members of the SAB breached the Honor
System? To my knowledge, the White Book
does not address the question of how one
maintains his finances.

Is it any wonder that the Hill has been
curtailing student responsibility with examples
like the SAB?

Let's hope that the SAB has answers for
the accusations made by Richard Spence.

dents it represents and the institution ‘
which brings them together. ,

One of the problems which can
occur within such a committee is '
the presence of bias. For if bias is ,
present, the committee is not objec-
tive; and if the committee is not ’
objective, then it is not a committee ,
which represents the student body —
but one which represents only the 9
ideas of its members. Keep in
mind, that just because a committee ’
has an elected body does not make g
it immune to the problem of bias.

Such was the situation which I 5'

Students affected
by Hurricane Hugo

By Kelley McCabe
Staff Reporter

Shortly after hurricane Hugo
crashed through South Carolina,
W&L senior Mary Hipp left school
to survey the damage done to her
home on Pawley’s Island, just south
of Myrtle Beach.

Hipp found that although Hugo
broke only a window of the main
house where her family resides part
time, the separate house where Hipp
resides was levelled.

To help Hipp and others who
suffered injuries and property
damages during the storm that
passed through South Carolina three
weeks ago, food, cleaning supplies
and other necessities were shipped
to the area from all over the nation
by groups like the Salvation Army.

Volunteers

By Tracey Thornblade
Staff Reporter

Have you ever wondered why a
bunch of Washington and Lee
students would be marching around
in uniform on a chilly Sunday
afternoon? The answer is that these
men are the Liberty Hall Volunteers,
who held a memorial service for
Gen. Robert E. Lee today at noon

in Lee Chapel.
The group was originally
founded in 1861 at Washington

College by Prof. James White to
ﬁght in the Civil War. The band of
73 men, 57 of them students at the
college, participated in every battle,
"march and encampment which Gen.
Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson
commanded from May 1861 to
Lee’s surrender at Appomattox in
April 1865.

Two Washington and Lee
students re—forrned the group in
1987 to preserve the historical
signiﬁcance of the volunteers’
presence on the W&L campus.
John Williamson and Earnest Shaver
were the two who reactivated the
group. One of Williarnson’s
ancestors had ‘been 'one~of" the

everywhere,’ said Hipp.

Alpha Phi Omega, W&L’s
service fraternity, was one of the
many groups who sponsored a drive
for the survivor's of Hugo. The
drive was organized by Lexington
resident Mirabai McLeod.

McLeod initially tried to donate
goods through the Red Cross, but
when she discovered the Red Cross
was not participating in a relief
program, she decided to organize
one on her own.

McLeod said she publicized the
drive through newspaper notices and
radio blurbs in the Lexington area.
Alpha Phi Omega also posted signs
around campus.

Although only two boxes of
goods were collected from W&L,
McLeod said concerned individuals
from the area donated many
cleaning supplies, non-perishable
food items, and baby food. VMI

students, Brownsburg Middle School
students and Days Inn also donated
supplies.

The drive successfully ﬁlled a
24-foot long truck, donated by U-
Haul, which was stationed in
Kroger’s parking lot all
Saturday, said McLeod.

Two VMI cadets drove the truck
to a small town in South Carolina
near McLellanville.

“For other groups
it's only a hobby,
but members here

group.”
— Kent Gregory
Kent Gregory, the current

president of the group, said the
volunteers are serious about their
commitment to the organization.

“For other groups it's only a
hobby, but members here have a
respect for the traditions of the
group," he said.

Gregory also stressed that the
group is not sectional. although the
volunteers represent members of the
Confederate militia. In fact, many of
the volunteers are from the North.

Throughout the year, the Liberty
Hall Volunteers participate in a
variety of activities. Each year they
march in several parades in the area
and hold a service commemorating

ALCOHOL

According to Montague, Deaver’s
talk is titled “Alcoholism: One
Man’s Battle.”

The movie Clean and Sober,
starring Michael Keaton, will be
shown Tuesday night in Gaines
Residence Hall, Hickam said.

Also on Wednesday afternoon,

there will be another speaker,
Marilyn Clayton, from the
Lexington Treatment Center, said
.Hickam.

.The SAB is helping the

committee sponsor a reggae band in
the General Headquarters restaurant
Wednesday night. According to
Hickam the Pit will not serve
alcohol that night.

The final activity is a Battle of
the Bands at the Pavilion. Campus
bands will compete for a $5(X) first
place prize and a $250 second place
pnze.

“We're going to judge the bands
on the yelling and applause of the
crowd. So hopefully the bands will
bring all their friends to clap for
them," Hickam said.

The committee is also conducting
a survey,

' “We’re trying to become aware
of what alcohol problems there are
on campus,” Hickam said. “The
display areas will have information
about alcohol and drinking laws that
people can pick up."

“It’s very hard to educate people
on campus about alcohol and its
effects," said Hickam. “We're
trying to do it in a fun way."

battles are celebrating their 125th

anniversary.
‘ The Liberty Hall Volunteers
attended three battles last year.

Members buy authentically designed
shirts and hats to participate, and
the Executive Committee allots nine
hundred dollars to the group to
purchase additional authentically-
styled equipment,

Last year several of the
volunteers participated in the 125th
armiversary of the battle of New
Market with several VMI cadets. A
movie was made on the scene, and
that ﬁlm will be a permanent part
of the exhibit in the Hall of Valor
at New Market.

This morning at 9:30 the bells of
Lee Chapel tolled nineteen times to
mark’ the time of Lee’s death. At
noon, the volunteers marched from
Washington Hall to Lee Chapel for
the memorial service. Capt. Robert
Peniston, the chapel curator, made
opening remarks. Afterwards, Prof.
Taylor Sanders gave a speech on
Lee's life, followed by a reading of
the death scene from a Lee
biography. Next, Lee’s favorite
hynm, “How Firm a Foundation,”

was played. The service ended with I

BUDGET

tions that are allocated funds by the
EC for the 1988-89 ﬁscal year is
$32,000. The previous year showed
a surplus of $20,000, according to
Assistant Controller Don Holt.

All surplus money at the end of
the ﬁscal year is placed into a stu-
dent reserve fund. Because the
money to pay for last year's deﬁcit
came from the reserve fund, the
fund was depleted to $l,(X)0.

University President John Wilson
granted the EC a one-time gift of
$15,0()0 this year to help the student
organizations with their finances.

Other changes the SAB has
made to help meet the budget in-
clude a concert checklist, which was
used in planning and organizing
Homecoming, and job descriptions.
The job descriptions provide a writ-
ten rather than verbal breakdown of
individual member's duties.

TALKBACK

"The people [there] were very
happy," said McLeod.

Chisolm Coleman, a sophomore
from Charleston, said that he saw

delivered four truck loads of twelve-
ounce beer cans full of drinking

Homecoming win puts Generals on track for best season in

—

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

People say that everything runs
in cycles.

If that is true, Washington and
Lee football faithful hope that the
cycle is true every ﬁve years.

It was ﬁve years ago when
W&L won it’s last Homecoming
football game, ironically against
Maryville. In that game, W&L
played a rather slow ﬁrst half
before exploding for 35 second half
points on the way to a 42-17 win.
The next week, W&L played at
Hampden-Sydney for the Tiger's
Homecoming game, in which the
Generals prevailed 32-20. Next
week, the Generals will travel to
Harnpden-Sydney. Is this the second
coming of 1985?

“I hope that 1985 turns into
1989,” said W&L head coach Gary
Fallon. “It’s nice to talk about, but
it’s got to be done in the present.
Our main concern is to stop them
from doing what they do and for us
to do what we do, and to come
home with a victory. That’s what
we’re going over there for.”

On Saturday, the Generals
played a relatively uneventful first
half, cautiously cruising out to a 10-
3 halftime lead.

The Generals received the
opening kickoff before the
Homecoming crowd of 5,005, and
junior kick returrier/slot back Carl
Gilbert almost gave the crowd a lot
to cheer about early. After ﬁelding
the kick off the ground, Gilbert
disappeared into a crowd, and then
appeared up the far sideline, and
was knocked out of bounds at the
W&L 49-yard line after a 29-yard
retum. -

From there, junior tailback
Mason Pope went to work. Three
straight carries got the Generals a
ﬁrst down, most of the yards

coming on second effort. Pope then
caught a pass from senior
quarterback Phillip Sampson for a
gain of 14 more.

After two more rims netted the
junior 14 yards, the Generals were
on the Maryville 15-yard line.
Senior Scott Jackson took an inside
handoff from Sampson and got
down to the six, where Pope
proceeded to barrel through the left
side into the end zone for a 7-0
W&L lead.

After Maryville was forced to
punt on its next drive, Sampson
made his only mistake of the game.
On second down from the W&L 34,
he tried to throw a middle screen,
but Maryville nose guard Jess
Massengill intercepted the W&L
signal caller. It was only Sampson’s
second interception of the year.

The Scots kept the ball on the
ground, and their drive stalled when
fullback Zack Blanton was stopped
on third down at the W&L six.
Maryville settled for a 23-yard ﬁeld
goal from Scott Porter to make the
score 7-3 at the end of the first
quarter. '

When the Generals initial drive
of the second stanza stalled and
Pope had to punt, Maryville
returned Sampson’s early gift. On,
their first play, in almost the exact
place on the field as Sampson<’s
interception, tailback Keith
Washington fumbled going into the
line when he was hit by senior
linebacker Mike Pack, and
sophomore nose guard Greg Kiehl
recovered for W&L.

Sampson worked the Generals
down to the Maryville eight,_ and
Pope got five yards to the three.
Then head coach Gary -Fallon
reached into his bag of tricks for
the halfback pass, Gilbert corralled
Pope's pass just out of the back of
the end zone. Pope lost a yard on
third down, and Quayle was called

from page 1

Said W&L interim athletic direc-
tor Richard Miller, “I think
[Walsh’s] basic experience in a situ-
ation similar. to ours at Dartmouth,
even though Dartmouth is Division
I-A, is not so far removed from
what we are dealing with here.
That, I think, is the greatest thing
he brings to us.”

As baseball coach, Wals is
credited with turning the program at
Dartmouth around. In 1981 Walsh
took over a losing team, and in
1987 led the Big Green to a 24-14
record, the Ivy League title and the
No. 1 ranking in New England and
a spot in the NCAA Division I
baseball championships.

Walsh, a member of the NCAA
Division I Baseball steering comrnit—
tee, was a finalist for national Divi-
sion I Coach-of-the-Year honors in
1987. He was named the 1987
Northeast and New England Coach-
of-the-Year. Walsh currently serves
on the Executive board of the New
England Intercollegiate Baseball
Coaches Association.

Walsh graduated from the Uni-
versity of Massachusetts at Amherst
in 1971. He attended Albany Law
School from 1971 to 1972 and has
done graduate work in sports

administration at his alma mater in
1975.

Before coming to Dartmouth,
Walsh served as head baseball and
basketball coach and admissions and
financial aid officer for the North-
field Mount Hermon School, the
nation's largest co-educational inde-
pendent school.

Said Wilson, “Michael is gentle-
man from a ﬁne family with high
values. He has good character and
will be a positive inﬂuence on all
of our lives.”

Walsh's first duty at W&L will
be to name the new head men‘s la-
crosse coach.

On the lacrosse program, Walsh

said, “Things tend to go in cycles,
and lacrosse is not quite up where
we would like them to be. Our goal
is to get the program back up to
par.”
Said Walsh, “W&L is a highly
competitive, well-rounded university
with a proper balance between ath-
letics and academics. This is Divi-
sion III, and I'm comfortable with
the situation. It is similar to Dart-
mouth, and each school has it’s
unique problems. We’Il delve into
any problems we find here and do
our best to solve them.”

Junior Craig Irons runs down the sideline after catching Phillip Sampson's
pass. The play was good for 80 yards and the Generals defeated
Maryville 26-10. W&L file photo by W. Patrick Hinely.

Sampson dropped back and looked
down the left sideline for junior
split end Craig Irons. Irons made a
leaping catch as two Maryvill:
defenders collided and fell down at
the W&L 40.

Irons had clear sailing down the

sideline for what would have been a
91-yard touchdown, but he stumbled
at the Maryville 20 and was pushed
out of bounds at the 10. The 80-
yard completion brought the crowd
to its feet, and put life into
relatively complacent W&L team.
The drive stalled as Sampson
was sacked, and the Generals settled
for Quaylc’s second ﬁeld goal of
the day, from 32 yards out to take a

13-3 lead. The rest of the third‘

quarter was uneventful, and W&L
had to punt as their ﬁrst drive of
the ﬁnal period stalled at their own
34. .

The Scots took over on their
own 42 with backup quarterback
Mike Wimpee, a passing specialist
in the game. On his ﬁrst'pass, he
was incomplete. On his second pass,
he was complete, but to the wrong
team. Junior safety Brad Miller read
the pass and picked it off at the 42
in front of the Scots’ bench. Miller
ran unrnolested down the sideline to
the ﬁve, ran over three Scots
would-be-tacklers into the end zone
for the touchdown and a 20-3 lead.
It was Miller’s second interception
of the year.

Miller’s retum broke the game
open, for on W&L’s next
possession, against what looked like
a beaten Maryville team, Sampson
set yet another record. On second
down from the Maryville 28,
Sampson faked a handoff to Crosby
and found a wide open Irons for a
touchdown. It was the senior’s 28th
career touchdown pass, breaking the
old record held by Jack Berry.
Quaylc’s kick was no good, and the
Generals led 26-3.

The Generals defense, which had
played very well, gave up a token
touchdown late in the game making
the ﬁnal score 26-10. Pack led the
defense with 15 tackles. Miller
made 14 tackles, three for losses.
Kiehl had eight tackles and a sack,

The Ring-tum Phi, October 12, 1989

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

They say records were made

‘to be broken, and so far this

football season, many a record
' has fallen by the wayside.

In every game he has played
this season, Washington and Lee
senior quarterback Phillip

I Sampson has either tied or
broken a W&L school record or
passed a career milestone. For
his accomplishments, Sampson
has been named The Ring-tum

Phi Athlete-of-the-Month for
September.
In W&L’s first game,

Sampson shattered the record for
passes’ completed in one game,
previously held by Jon Thornton
at 24. Sampson finished the day
with 34 completions. In game
two Sampson threw four
touchdown passes to tie the

.record held by Thornton, Steve
Fluharty, and Jack Berry.

4 Against Centre in the season’s

- third week, no records fell, but
on his first completion, Sampson

, went over the 3,0()0-yard passing

;. marker for his career.

‘ In week four, Sampson’s 311

. yards passing broke the record

‘ for passing yardage in a single

,1. game fell, previously held by
Fluharty, and last week, against
Maryville, Sampson took over ,
the lead in touchdown passes for
a career with 28. Berry held the
old mark of 27.

i For the season, Sampson has
a remarkable 89 completions in
131 attempts with just two
interceptions for 1,057 yards and
10 touchdowns. His passing
efficiency rating is an astounding

;._ 157.8, good enough to place him

third in the nation. An average

 

i

 
 

ATHLETE-OF-THE-MONTH

  

efficiency rating is 100.

On his current pace,
Sampson could break every
W&L record a quarterback could
hold except passing attempts.

Upon returning to school this
fall, Sampson had an idea of
how close he was to some of
the records, but “during the
games, though, none of us think
about what kinds of records we
may be breaking or what kind of

f e a t s w e m a y b e
accomplishing.”

What makes Sampson's
season even more remarkable

was that he spent the summer in
London. “I was able to throw
the ball some, but there weren’t
really any good weight rooms
where I could work out.”
Sampson is also quick to
point out that he could not put
up the numbers he has this year

llllp Sampson i tion. W fil p by .

ea .
Patrick Hinely.

without help from some rather
large friends. “People always
say that the offensive line
doesn't get any credit, but our
offensive line has really played
out of its head this year. We
lost a couple of really good
offensive linemen last year, and
this year we didn't know where
we would stand, but these guys
are just playing great.

“It's the same with Russ.
He’s hardly carried the ball this
year, but he's just a part of any
record the team might set as
anyone is.“

The offensive line consists of
senior Rich Poli, juniors Rob
Christensen, MIke DeMelfi, Rob
Robertson, and Frank Sudell and
sophomores Jim Henry and Rob
Thomas.

Aside from being the
Generals starting quznterback in

    

Sampson rewriting recor book

the fall, Sampson is also an Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Pole Vault champion on the
track team.

On the field, the 6-2, 195-
pound senior out of St. John’s
High School in Houston, Texas
is having an All-American
season. Off the field, Sampson
would just as soon spend a quiet
day out in the country with
some friends as anything else.
“I like to spend time out in the
country at some of my friends
country houses. I have a bike
that I enjoy riding. I like
hanging out at the fraternity
house. I’m just a regular old
guy,” said Sampson.

After graduation, Sampson is
unsure of what he plans on
doing. “I’m thinking about
getting a job back in Houston,”
said Sampson. “But if I can’.t
find the kind of job I want this
Christmas, then I’ll probably end
up going to law school.”

Sampson said his career here
at W&L both on and off the
ﬁeld has had many memorable
moments, and he has had his
share of the good and the bad.
“I can think of some pretty
memorable bad things that have
happened to me, but I’ve had
tons of great things happen as
well, things that have meant a
lot to me. One thing that will
always stand out for me was our
game at Bridgewater last year. It
was a huge win, and I think
everyone who was on that
football team will remember that
forever.”

Congratulations to Phillip
Sampson, The Ring-tum Phi’s
Athlete-of-the-Month for
September.

, It has been the long and winding
road that has hurt the Washington
' and Lee men‘s soccer team.
,, The Generals proved how tough
.they are at home when they
{entertained the best team in the
v South Region last Saturday.
, On Saturday, the Mary
‘.Washington soccer machine rolled
“into Lexington with a 9-1 record.
The Eagles were ranked seventh in
4 the Division HI national polls, No.
'1 in the South Region, and had won
-eight straight games. In their past
9,13 home games, the Eagles had not
been scored upon.

On the road in Lexington was a
“different story, though. The Generals
‘fare unbeaten on the Liberty Hall
“Field, and freshman Mike Mitchem
jggnade it evident early on that W&L
{would not be intimidated.

 Mitchem scored early in the first
"_half to give W&L a 1-0 lead which
_';held until late in the game. Junior
pylon Bull again had a tremendous

game, keeping the Eagles off the
"board until late in the game.

 

Mary Washington evened the

score near the end of the match
with a ‘penalty kick.

With ten minutes gone in the

game, the Generals were scrambling
for the ball in front of the Eagles’
net. A lot of bodies hit the ground,
and while the Mary Washington
players screamed for a dangerous
play, Mitchem poked the ball into
the goal.

W&L nearly increased its slim

lead at 17:56 of the first half when
sophomore Jeff Zieger clanked the
ball off the right post with a shot
from the right wing.

Although Mary Washington had

just one shot on goal in the first
half, they kept Bull busy in the
second half. With constant offensive
pressure, the Eagles got off a point-
blank shot, and sent several headers
just over the crossbar.

W&L’s defense refused to fold,
nd it appeared that the Generals

were about to pick up their fourth
straight victory.

However, with 15:10 remaining

Zieger drew a whistle for tripping at
the top left edge of the penalty box.

For the next

15 minutes the

game seemed destined to head into
overtime as neither team mounted a
serious offensive threat. Then, with

just under 10 seconds remaining

in

the match, it looked as though Mary
Washington would emerge with the

win.
An Eagle forward

defense and

broke away with ball down the left
side. With the game clock running
out, he launched a shot. Bull dove
to his right, deflected the ball, and
turned to watch it roll wide past the
right post to send the game into

overtime.

In the first

overtime, Bull

prevented a loss for the Generals
again by snuffing another one-on-

one breakaway at 11:20.
,W&L’s best scoring chance

in

overtime came in the second period
when the Generals let loose a flurry
of shots after the Eagles could not

clear the ball from their backfield.

Head coach Rolf Piranian was
not quite satisfied with holding
Mary Washington to a tie. “I felt
like we could have and should have
won,” he said. “In the second half
we got tired, didn't play very smart
and lost our composure.”

The Generals, who have yet to
win a game away from Liberty Hall
Field, took to the ﬁeld Wednesday
for an Old Dominion Athletic
Conference game with Lynchburg.

Said Piranian, “This is our
biggest week of the season,"
Piranian said. “We haven’t proven
ourselves on the road this season.”

The Generals continued to be
jinxed on the road, as Lynchburg
ended the Generals’ unbeaten streak
at four with a 3-0 win.

On the season, the Generals are
4-5-1, 2-1 in the ODAC. The
Generals are 4-0-1 at home and
winless in five tries on the road.

W&L will get another chance to
right its road woes with a
conference game at Virginia
Wesleyan Saturday.

The win was W&L’s first ever
on Homecoming weekend. Hathom
encouraged her players to learn
from the experience with what is
the team’s favorite motto: “You
either win or you learn.” She
added, “We just didn’t have a good
day, and we didn’t play our best

Like father, like son, like son

Three generations of Jennings reunite for Homecoming

By Joel Dyes
Staff Reporter

Like father, like son.

In journalism Prof. John K.
Jennings‘ family, that expression is
more than just a phrase —- it truly
applies. For three generations,
Jennings men have walked down the
colonnade as students of Washington
and Lee.

During a Homecoming luncheon
Saturday, Jennings, his father and
his son talked about life at W&L.

Prof. Jennings’ 83—year-old
father, Matt Jennings, of
Fayetteville, Tenn., is more robust
than his wiry son. His gruff voice
and expressive eyes say he's a no
nonsense man. He is a little hard of
hearing; Prof. Jennings repeated
many of the questions the reporter
asked.

“I went to Washington and Lee
some years ago,” Matt Jennings
said. “I graduated in 1927. My
brother James and I both did. Of
course he was older. He's 86 now.

"I wanted to breed Jersey
cattle," the senior Jennings recalled,
“but my father wanted me to go to
school and study something else. I
went, to please him. And when I
got out, I bred Jersey cattle.”

The elder Jennings said he
majored in history, ‘math and
geology — "and girls.”

“I'm glad it went co—ed,” he
said. “It’s really much more
convenient. We use to have to go
all the way to Randolph-Macon.”

Jennings’ said he didn't meet his
wife at college.

“Nope, I got her at home in
Tennessee,” he sniffed.

“When I was here," Matt
Jennings said, “I didn't have time
to do much besides study. I
wrestled some, but I needed my
extra time to study. It was difficult
getting through.”

The oldest Jennings said he did
not put pressure on his son to come
to W&L but strongly suggested it.
Prof. Jennings, however, had
interests different from his father’s.

"I wanted to be a journalist, so
that was my major,” said Jemiings,
who graduated from Washington and
Lee in 1956.

'27, John Jennings, '56, and Matthew Jennings,

As a student, said Jennings, his
extra—curricular activities included
The Ring-tum Phi and WREL, the
local radio station.

"We dir.Ln.’t have a radio station
on campus at that time,” he said.
He met his wife Julie during
graduate school at Stanford.

Unlike his father, Prof. Jennings
stuck pretty close to his major when
he graduated. He went to WDBJ-TV
in Roanoke after graduation and in
1959 came back to W&L to teach.

As for co-education, Prof.
Jennings said, “I'm glad the women
came, too. I was all for it from the
beginning. It improved the facilities,
and everything looks better.” ‘

“You lcnow, there wasn't a
footbridge when I was here either,”
the eldest Jennings said. “I don’t
know if that was before the women
or not. But, we use to have to wade
across the bottom.”

The senior Jennings said he did
not spend all of his working years
raising Jersey cattle. He spent 32
years of his life with the Tennessee
Department of Agriculture.

Measures Division of the National
Association of the Commission of
Agriculture,” he said proudly.
“.There’s even a government
building in Fayetteville named for
me. Now, that was a big day. The
mayor and governor even turned out
for that one.”

Jennings retired in 1973. “What
do I do now?” asked. “N0thin’l I
believe the phrase is retired. And,
I am fully that.”

Prof. Jennings, 55, is his parents’
only child.

"He was a good boy, a fine

sort,” his father said. “Not a
moment’s trouble.” Prof. Jennings
smiled, embarrassed, and looked
away.

Prof. Jennings son, Matthew, a
freshman at W&L, has, a sister
Sarah, who is a freshman at

Lexington High School.

“I like Washington and Lee and
decided to come here," Matthew
Jennings said. “My dad didn't try

to make me come or anything; i
just wanted to. I don’t think his
being a professor at the same school
I attend is really a big deal. I just
don’t think about it.

“I'm majoring in journalism,
also, and I have a morning radio
show,” he said. “I plan to try out
for basketball, too.”

“Professor de Maria is his
adviser,” Matthew’s father said. “I
don’t think there's really a chance
I'll get him in one of my classes.
By the time he has to take my
journalism law course, I hope to be
on a sabbatical.”

Matthew’s grandfather said he
keeps in touch with his son and
grandson through phone calls and
visits. “We talk to them about once
a month," he said. I

“And they'll visit about twice a
year or we'll go down," Prof.
Jennings added.

“I have to know everythin
that's going on with W&L,’ sai
the eldest Jennings. “I have to keep
up, and John’s a pretty good
source."

EC ends SAB charging

 

By Melinda Conkling
Stafl’ Reporter

The Executive Committee has
eliminated all charging privileges for
the Student Activities Board in an
effort to stop unaccounted spending
and will sttidy a proposal to extend
the bait on charging to all
EC—funded organizations.

The SAB, which lost at least
S23,(t00 last year, is still receiving
bills, the EC learned at its meeting
lVlontlay.

Roses’ stores sent a bill for
$816 last week, a re—order, for .
t-shirts will cost $1,300, and a

82,089 walkie-talkie rental bill came
in last month, SAB Treasurer Katie
Duwcl told the EC.

Freshman
class runoff
held today

lit.’ Jason Kelley
Staff‘ Reporter

Elections for freshman Executive

Committee representative, class
presiclent, and vice president were
held today after a Tuesday’s

preliminary vote forced a run off in
all three races.

About 80 percent of the.
iT('s‘lllllCi1 voted in the preliminary

Clvctioti, according to Voting
Rcgttltitions Board President Wes
Goings.

t .

l”ve been involved in this for
three years, and this is by far the
largest turnout I’ve seen,” said
Goings. “But freshmen generally
Itl‘.‘i out in large numbers for these
clectiotis."

According to Goings, the vote
wits very close and in two cases;
only one vote separated those who

riizicle it into the runoffs from those
who (lid not.

The vote for EC representative
was distributed among twelve

etnitlitltites, with Sean D. Gatewood
and Josh MacFarland each receiving
eiiough votes to face off in today's
rtniolf.

(.}atewood, when asked why he
lililllglll he was the most qualiﬁed
for the post, said, “What made me
want to come to W&L Was, in part,
the Honor System and the freedom
it tillows the students. I want to be
a part of that."

M ac Farland said he had
CXliL‘i'lCllCC with an honor system
like Washington and Lee’s in high
scho<>l.

The only female make it to any
of the runoffs was class president
caiididate Kimberly Gladysz.

"There’s no point to sexism in
this ctiinpaign,” said her opponent,
Rieliziitl Burke. “The one who is
niost qualified should be elected. If
aiiyone brought up the issue of
sexisni in this campaign, it was
her.”

But Gladysz said, “There
should be no sexist slant on this

Cl0C1i<>Ii. and the better candidate
should win.”

’ "“>’»:5.» .

Junior Rep. John Fialcowitz met
with University Controller John
Cuny last week to discuss improve-
ments of the EC ﬁnancial system.
They agreed the main problem (last
year was SAB cost over-runs, said
Fialcowitz.

“A way to solve over-runs is to
eliminate all charge accounts. This
is not a punitory measure against
the SAB. This is not a personnel
problem,” Fialcowitz said. “We’re
questioning the structure (of SAB
spending). Structures don’t change
from year to year but people do,”
said Fialcowitz.

Charge accounts are primarily
used for concerts and Fancy Dress,
SAB officers told the EC. If the
SAB runs out of ice or soda during
a concert, SAB workers used the

charge accounts to pay for “emer-
gency” items.

Although many of the supplies
needed for FD decorations are
ordered months in advance, during
the last couple of weeks before FD,
the “crush period,” the FD commit-
tee often needs extra supplies, SAB
officers said.

According to Hitz, charge
accounts are needed because it’s not
possible to get a check from the
Business Ofﬁce during non—business
hours.

In order to accommodate any
such emergencies during the “crush
period," the SAB wll- cash —checks
and use that money to pay for
emergency items, according to FD
Auditor Terrence Fowler.

Deaver describes

his fight with alcohol

By Andrew Waters
Staff Reporter

“I'm Mike and I'm an
alcoholic,” the former deputy chief
of staff for President Ronald Reagan
said calmly as he took the podium
Monday night in Lee Chapel. It’s a
greeting he said he uses in
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

After apologizing for appearing
too formal in his suit and tie,
Michael Deaver told the audience of
about 225 in Lee Chapel his history
of alcoholism and praised AA and
similar education programs as the
few. effective ways to ﬁght a
drinking problem.

His hour—long speech,
“Alcoholism: One man's battle
against his personal dreams,” was
co—sponsored by the Washington and
Lee Health Education Committee
and Contact, with additional funding
from the Interfratemity Council.
W&L is one of more than 2000
colleges participating in the National
Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week.

His tie loosened and his top
shirt button undone, Deaver
described his problems with
alcoholism, which he said is a
disease.

Deaver said he shunned alcohol
while growing up to avoid the
problems he saw with his alcoholic
parents - until he joined a fraternity
during his second year in college.
By the time he left college, he said,

he had someone to drink with every
day.

Deaver’s ability to play the
piano took him around the world as
a performer in bars.

“That was like a kid in a candy
store," he said, “because everybody
wanted to get the piano player
drunk, and I went along with that.”

He wound up playing a bar in
California and, he said, "one thing
led to another, I got into politics,"
and thus began his relationship with
Reagan. Deaver followed Reagan
into the White House in 1980 as
deputy chief of staff, a position he
held for 4 1/2 years.

Deaver said he didn‘t drink
much until about 1983, when he
began making trips to the far east
aboard planes with well-stocked
bars.

“I found out when I got back
that I was saying to myself, ‘it’s
OK to take a drink at 10:00 in the
morning because it’s 5:00 where
I’ve just been.’” It was at that
point, he said, that alcohol took
over and he couldn’t get through the
day without drinking.

“In this society, it’s not a very
honorable thing to admit,” Deaver
said with a pause, “that I drank
vodka in the White House. But I
did. And I couldn’t stop.”

In May of 1985, after two stays
in the hospital, Deaver left politics
and began his own lobbying ﬁrm.
After six months on the wagon, he
began drinking again amid

W&L movin’ on up

School places 18th, 22nd in rankings

By Lee Fleming
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee has once again fared well in
national college and university rankings by U.S. News
and World Report and USA Today.

In the U.S. News ranking of “National Liberal-Arts
Colleges,” Washington and Lee placed 18th out of the
top 25 schools.

Last year W&L placed 24th in the same category.

The U.S. News ranking, which is based largely on a
survey of college presidents and deans around the
country, assigns the schools a composite score based
on ﬁve categories.

Each school was graded on the basis of academic
reputation, student selectivity, retention patterns, faculty.
and ﬁnancial resources.

Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania ranked first in
the category with a perfect score of 100.0.

W&L, the only Virginia school in the category,
received a 78.2.

Also in the U.S. News “1990 College Guide” was
a list of the “Best Buys” in higher education. This list
included the schools with the lowest tuitions among the
top-rariked schools in each category.

In its category of “National Liberal Arts Colleges,”
W&L finished as the overall best buy. Its tuition of
$10,100 a year, the magazine points out, is
approximately one third less than Swarthmore’s.

In the USA Today ranking of the “USA’s Choosiest
Colleges,” W&L appears 22nd on a list of 52.

To appear in the ranking, a school must accept
fewer than half its applicants and its freshman must
average at least 1200 on the SAT.

According to the listing, W&L accepted 28.9
percent of its applicants for the class of 1993. The
average SAT score of W&L freshmen was 1236.

Topping the list was the U.S. Coast Guard
Academy in New London, Connecticut, which acctpts
9.4 percent of its applicants and has an average
freshman SAT of 1200.

Other Virginia schools appearing on the USA list
are the College of William and Mary in Williarrisburg
and the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

Despite the fact that this year’s showing in the
rankings is the university‘s best yet, W&L
administrators are still hesitant to attatch any particular
importance to them.

“Overall, I'm somewhat suspicious,” said Dean of
Students Lewis John. “On one hand, I don’t
particularly like such rankings. But on the other hand,
it is nice that others appreciate the type of school we
are." - ~

W&L President John D. Wilson agreed.

“A lot of people pay attention to these polls and
forget that they‘re based on a subjective set of
opinions,” he said. “They have gotten better in recent

The Interfraternity Council Tues-
day night refused to grant Contact’s
budget request of $13,0()0, pending
a presentation to the full IFC next
week by Contact representatives.

The budget request, which was
presented to the IFC Judicial Board
last week, calls for each fraternity
to pay a per—member fee of $12.
Last year, each fraternity paid $10
per member, amounting to approxi-
mately $9,000, according to IFC
President Kevin Nash.

The fraternity representatives,
however, asked the Judicial Board
to postpone consideration of the
budget request until the next meet-
mg.
“We (the IFC) have always
been one of the primary sponsors of
Contact,” said IFC Vice President
Hunt Neidringhaus. “I think this is
a small price to pay to get quality

“The IFC seems to be fairly

OPINION
Only $23,000?  

So great. So Washington and Lee has a healthy
endowment. So a lot of students come from wealthy
families. So “charge it home” is a way of life. These
facts are not new.

W&L’s endowment, in sum with the large amount of
money that alumni give to the school each year, affords
us a lot more than a beautiful, well-kept campus and new
computers: in conjunction with all the wealth in our
families’ backgrounds it affords us all an attitude as well.

Usually that attitude manifests itself only in a
lighthearted “Well, we deserve certain things because the
school has the money to give them to us.” Usually we
are joking. We can do that because the school and its
students are all acclimated to being around a fair amount
of wealth, either from the manner in which we were
raised — it’s no secret that the BMWs and Saabs that are
lined up in campus parking lots were not bought from

money we students earned during summer jobs — or from A

having been at W&L in and around the school’s wealth
the last few years of our lives.

Look at all the new construction. In Gaines Hall there
are walk-in closets, a weight room and kitchens. There are
personal computers all over campus for student use. The
infirmary is free.

We have all become so used to it, these relative
luxuries, and it’s beginning to blur our judgement.

The school throws a weekend-long bash for the entire
student body every year. Think about that. The school —
through the student activities funds allocated to the SAB -
- pays for it, helped by our $40 ticket cost, which is
minimal when you consider all it buys: the decorations,
two bands, a full orchestra and assorted side shows, such
as elephants, fire-eaters and whatnot. Students from other
schools think it’s insane that the school would spend so
much money on a party, but it is in keeping with the
styles and traditions of W&L.

But is being so cavalier about a $23,000 budget loss a
part of tradition? No. Does it contain a single grain of
style? No. But it is happening.

Suddenly, the EC is the bad guy because it is
attempting not to allow a similar budget overrun this year.
Suddenly, students are saying that $23,000 isn’t that much
money, why is everyone complaining? “The EC members
had fun at Fancy Dress last year. I don’t know why
they’re so uptight about the loss.” That is what is being
said in the Co-op and in the classrooms before class
begins.

How can we take that attitude? $23,000 is more than
twice the tuition that won us national acclaim. $23,000 is
more than the average W&L graduate will make in his
first year out of college. $23,000 is far above the poverty
level that we learn about in economics. Anyone raising a
family in a regular job, not even someone under the
poverty level, would be disgusted to hear college students,
driving around in their nice cars in their nice clothes, say,
“It’s not that much money. So what?”

Didn’t we learn something about the real world beyond
these red brick walls and white columns? Haven’t we at
least learned the value of money, as a virtue of out
having been so fortunate thus far?

When President John Wilson made a $16,000 donation
to the student activities fund last month, a lot of the
students thought that was an unsurprising step of action.
“We deserve it anyway,” seemed to be the general
opinion. Well, maybe we don’t. The issue is not why FD
was over budget. The issue is not how to make FD less
expensive. The issue here is serious. $23,000 is a
monumental amount of money - far too much to be
brushed off as a sum we deserve, only for having had the
good fortune to be born with more than most around us.

Restoring R.E

MY VIEW
By Taylor Sanders

At a memorial service marking the 119th-

anniversary of the death of Gen. Robert E. Lee,
Washington and Lee history Pro_f. Taylor Sanders
spoke on Lee and his legacy. The words that

follow are adapted from that address.

Recently a Southern visitor who had spent
soirie time at Washington and Lee commented
that she found our campus surprisingly cold and
aloof. She said it was indistinguishable from
various larger campuses with which she was
farriiliar. I agreed, noting that I found the same
spirit here when I visited the school in the early
1960s.

As the university _has grown larger and more
complex, it has become more difficult to main-
tain the spirit of community that marked the
campus in Robert E. Lee’s day. With each new
wave of self-indulgence, each needless display of
wealth and status, self-centeredriess and hedo-
nisrn, the Lee legacy of spirituality, courtesy,
self-control and self-sacrifice, the life of what
Lee called “comfortable subsistence” wanes.
Understandably, these values are replaced by
cries for more freedom and self-govemment, but
often without the responsibility and accountabili-
ty that Lee also demanded of his students.

As a Southerner, I fear we are on the verge
of losing these positive southern traditions, espe-
cially traditions embodied in men like Lee. But
as a historian who has recently read the Gallup
poll asserting that some 40 percent of American
College seniors could not place the Civil War in
its proper quarter century, I am not surprised
that Americans have a difficult time identifying
positive Southern core values, much less main-
taining them.

Elements of those core values, which three
decades ago differentiated North from South,
included the ‘centrality of race and religion, in-
tense family and kinship feelings, the importance
of a commonly experienced history — with
shared frustrations, defeat, poverty and deep
devotion to a particular community (steeple top
patriotism). Intermixed with these were positive
rural values such as hospitality and the impor-
tance of oral traditions, stressing things like
courtesy, honor and forbearance.

These traditions, however, were not universal

EC addresses
secrecy issue 

We are all aware of the privileges that
come with our Honor System at Washington
and Lee. However, these privileges entail
responsibilities. Every student at W&L during
his freshman year was asked to read the White
Book and sign a card stating he had done so.
Our philosophy for the Honor System and the
procedures for a Closed and a Student Body
Hearing are contained in the White Book.

If a question about another student’s honor
exist in your mind, you, whether student, staff
member, faculty member, or administrator are
faced with three options. You may confront the
suspected student privately or, if you do not
feel comfortable confronting the student, you
must turn the matter over to the Executive
Committee. However, if you do not wish to
turn in the possible honor violation to the EC,
the matter must be dropped and never men-
tioned again.

The EC is bound to protect any students
from harassment and defamation of character.
As stated in Section 0 of the White Book:

Any and all information about a possible
Honor System violation or an Executive Com-
mittee Hearing is highly confidential. The Exec-
utive Committee may take disciplinary steps
against any student who breaks this confidenti-
ality [Emphasis mine]. For example, the
accused, any student interviewed in an investi-
gation, or any witness in an Executive Commit-
tee Hearing may be placed on social or con-
duct probation» or suspended from the Universi-
ty. An advocate may be permanently suspended
from the right to advocate Executive Committee
matters. An Executive Committee member may
be suspended from oﬂice or may be placed on
probation for one or more hearings.

The EC will not hesitate to enforce Section
0 of the White Book.

on Liberty Hall

I find it necessary to respond to the article
written by Gary McCullough and Aelica Irigen-
thron that appeared in last week's Ring-tum
Phi. Although they claimed to be writing in
condemnation of the Executive Committee's
budget decisions, Mr. McCullough and Miss
Ingenthron decided to divert from their original
argument and larnbast the Liberty Hall Volun-
teers.

To quote Mr. McCullough and Miss Ingen-
tliron, “And what could be more offensive
than a group of southern college students
marching around in Confederate unifomis."
They even diverted further, insinuating that the
Liberty Hall Volunteers had a racist point of
view.

the truth or more ignorant than the completely

This position distinguished him from some other
southerners, especially those known as the

people were gentlemen, ‘but their behavior was
marked by violence, conspicuous consumption,
an inﬂated and jealous claim for individual
rights (their own), a touchy sense of honor —
and a rigid code to go with it.

In fact Lee’s entire life was a rebuke to
those dandified good-old-boys, with their panama
hats, brocaded vests and fancy boots. Lee's own
system was based on Paul’s letter to Colossians,
which stressed values such as mercy, rriildness,
kindness, humility and obedience.

Many of Lee’s contemporaries held codes of
honor and ethics based on rigid rules that made

Last week I wrote a letter in response to

Story unclear,
says reader

Last week I read on the front page sorne-
thing that I was confident was inaccurate. In
Brooke Jarabek's article “SAB rules revised;
accounts closed” the printed text read, “The
number of organizations to which the EC gives
funds has increased from 5 or 6 two years ago
to about 25 this year, said Dumas.”

This information had great relevance to the
sentence that followed: “The student activities
fee that each student pays yearly to provide
funds for these student groups has increased by
only $5 in that time.”

From the comprehensive budget allocations
statements given to me by EC Vice President
Jon Sheinberg, I found that 25 organizations
were allocated funds this year, 7 of which
were sports clubs. Two years ago, there were
23 organizations allocated funds, of which 6
were sports organizations.

In reality, only 2 more organizations re-
ceive funding from the EC currently than did
in the '87-'88 school year, not 19 or 20 as the
previous article would lead one to believe.
This is not to say that these are the same orga-
nizations that petitioned the EC for funding in
the '87-'88 school year plus two new ones.
Nor is it to say how much money these orga-
nizations need to operate.

The point of bringing this to light is to set
the record straight and to enter a plea to all
persons submitting material for campus publi-
cation. Please, whether it is for the news page
or for the editorial page, check your facts and
get proof before you put it in print. It is dan-
gerous to do otherwise, especially here where
the Honor System is applied broadly and sub-
jectively.

Letters defend

‘road Queens’

In response to Miss Nock’s enlightening
letter to The Ring-tum Phi, last week, I would
like to take this opportunity to thank Miss
Nock for her brilliant and timely analysis of
the 1988 controversy concerning that year's
Fancy Dress Ball.

Perhaps after another two years of intense
scrutiny Miss Nock will be blessed with the
startling realization that the W&L tradition of
selecting a Homecoming Queen each year was
established well before the Board of Trustees’
1984 decision to have W&L be a coeducational
institution. At this point, Miss Nock might also
realize that Washington and Lee women, how-
ever beautiful and talented they may be, do not
have a monopoly on those characteristics that
have traditionally defined “Homecoming
Queen.”

Sincerely,
Greg Golden, '91

I am writing in response to Miss Nock’s
letter which appeared in the last publication of
The Ring-tum Phi. I agree that a W&L woman
winning Homecoming Queen should not create
a fuss. I do however object when we are told
that only a coed can win that honor.

Girls frorri “Hollins/Sweetbriar, etc.” are
NOT foreigners on our campus. They are, and
always have been, an integral part of life at
W&L. If a fraternity wants to sponsor a girl
from another school for Homecoming Queen,
she should be offered every consideration given
to a coed. She too is part of a special relation-
ship existing between the students of W&L,
Hollins, MBC, Sweetbriar, and R—MWC. It is a
traditional relationship that makes our college
experience unique.

If you need proof that such a relationship
exists, or that it affects everyone here, just
look around. Obviously girls from down the
road come to our parties, and we (yes, even
coeds) go to theirs, but we also have access to
their libraries, and they check out books here.
Just as in Lexington, we are answerable to the
EC, SCC, or CRC for our conduct on their
campuses, and until quite recently (class of
’89) our freshman viewbooks included fresh-
men at their schools too. Where else have you
encountered colleges with such ties?

It is sad to see traditions die, especially in
a place where they are as proudly revered as
they are here. Unfortunately, as the ratio of
women to men nears 50-50, and as long as a
segment of our student body feels a necessity
to cling to a xenophobic contempt for girls
from other schools, this tradition also seems
doomed to eclipse like the necktie, and the
speaking tradition.

Girls from down the road are as much a
part of Washington and Lee as any student
here. They represent tradition. Considering the
importance we at W&L place on traditions,
perhaps the “road cheese” has more of a
place on this campus than some of our own
students.

return what we don’t use,” Fowler
said.

Duwel agreed the no-charges
policy can work.

“We’ll stretch the ‘crush period’

to three weeks and encourage peo-
ple to plan ahead. If we run out of
money, people will realize that they
have been poor planners,” she said.

FD Chairman Alex Hitz agreed
this was a good idea, but he said
“someone will need to be there (at
the gym or pavilion) whenever
stores are open.”

“We can plan all we want to,
but things are going to go wrong,”
Hitz told the EC.

EC Vice President Jon Sheinberg
suggested purchase orders as a sub-
stitute for charging. A student
would obtain a purchase order from
the business office and present it to
the store where the merchandise is
bought

This way, said Sheinberg, the
business office would know instant-
ly how much was being spent, in-
stead of months later when the bills
arrived.

‘ ‘I wouldn’t mind charge ac-
counts staying open if people
learned how to use purchase

orders,” Sheinberg said.
“I think this purchase order
thing, although I don't know what it

means, sounds feasible," said . SAB .
Director, . ’ Michael ‘

Entertainment
Applebaum.

Several other suggestions regard-
ing how the SAB could continue
charging and keep up-to-date records
were made. Hitz suggested there be
FD accounts at stores like Wal-Mart
and K-Mart. SAB members would
write a description of what they
bought and turn in forms to Duwel
or Fowler. These bills could be paid
each week, said Hitz.

SAB Chairman Charles Conklin
suggested a “compromise” be
found.

“Instead of making two trips
[one to get a price and then another
with a check made out by Duwel],
why don’t we just charge and pay
bills on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
Only certain members of the SAB
Board could have the authority to
charge things,” said Conklin.

Duwel said the idea of receipts
and ﬁlling out forms would not
work.

“Last year [FD Chairwoman]
Liz Smith would throw receipts at

[Treasurer] Mike Carroll and he of-C

ten didn't know which bills were
paid and which weren't," said
Duwel.“We want to put all of our
expenses on paper right away.”

Fialcowitz disagreed with Hitz
and Conklin.

“This (elimination of charges)
will be an inconvenience and it will
cause further planning. But what it
comes down to is that you’re going
to have to check with the treasurer
before you buy stuff,” said
Fialcowitz.

Third-year law Rep. David An-
thony brought the compromise dis-
cussion to an end.

“I think we’re spending a lot of
time trying to figure out a perfect
way to handle this, and it’s not go-
ing to happen,” said Anthony. “We
have 65 percent of our student orga-
nizations overspending. That’s ob-
scene. That's obscene. What if a
guy goes out and charges ﬁve
grand? We’re screwed. I’m not will-
ing to fund any transgressions.”

Fialcowitz made a motion outlin-
ing the no-charging policy.

The proposal, which passed 8-4,
consists of eliminating all charging
privileges for the SAB and making
the business office the sole area of
access for funds for the SAB.

The motion also allowed the EC
to establish penalties for violating
the no-charging rule and to send a
statement outlining the ﬁnal motion
to the SAB.

Finally, the,motion_,estabVlished a
subcominittee to explore possibilities
of " extending ' this policy to ,other
organizations.

EC President Willard Dumas
named himself, Junior Rep. Tom
Hatcher, Anthony and Fialcowitz to
the subcommittee that will examine
whether the policy should be ex-
tened. A motion to make the
no-charging policy campus-wide
failed ll-1 Monday night, with only
Anthony supporting it.

The SAB presented the minutes
from their last meeting. Sheinberg
requested a more detailed account
so that “at the end of each event
we can sit down and see how close
you are to your budget."

The SAB reported everything is
running well so far this year.

“We are ahead. We have more
money to spend than we thought we
would,” said Duwel.

According to Applebaum, the
SAB lost approximately $1,300 on
the magician act last weekend.

“We anticipated a lot more peo-
ple and underestimated the expense
costs,” said Applebaum.

Abortion: The Final Solution?

MY VIEW

By J. Cameron
Humphries

“God is dead.” — Nietzsche

. In the three months that have
passed since the Supreme Court
partially overturned Roe v. Wade,
the initial dust clouds have settled,
battle lines drawn and redrawn, and
sides entrenched in preparation fér
what most consider the inevitable’
overturn of the 1973 decision
sometime in November.
seems improbable — if not
impossible — for either side to
achieve an amendment to the
Constitution in its favor, ‘and since
the courts cannot continue to
establish a precedent only to have
another ideology overturn it, then it
is necessary to seek some other
solution to this question.

Ever since Newton, we have
turned to the discoveries of science
as the one source of that is
unfaltering, absolute, and above all
unquestionable. Whereas myth,
philosophy, and God were all once
the bedrock of man's knowledge,

the modern man now accepts
science. '
« No questions of ‘ ‘rights’ ’ or

“truths” gave us these answers, but
instead science and the scientific
method of thought. Thus, I now
propose that we look to science to
solve the question of abortion. Then
when science states its case, we, the
citizens of the twentieth century will
know the “truth." There will be no
need for debate, much as a
mathematician would not argue his
multiplication tables.

To begin, we must separate myth
from science.

First, man is animal. It is a
crude, somewhat depressing thought,
nevertheless an essential one. I do
not mean he has no inherent rights,
or that he is not quite advanced and
thus removed from the animal
kingdom. I mean most precisely that
since he evolved from them, he,
excuse me, I mean we, are part of
them as well.

Secondly, man cannot be
considered to have either soul or

SANDERS

from page 2 “E” 

While it‘

conscience, since science has never
found the biological organ or any
matter which comprise either the
soul or the conscience, man must be
considered not to have one. Sure,
philosophers and psychologists have
often mentioned and referred to the
soul and to the conscience; but, we
in the scientific age want facts,
hard, cold, and concrete ones. Faith
and the rest of that garbage that
chained and bound man for
centuries is no longer acceptable.

Then on these two rules I hang
all the laws and the profits of our
new society. Now I know we’re not
here to establish a new society but
to answer one question within our
own. So trust me, I’ll not talk of a
new utopia, just abortion. In review
thus far we have agreed that instead
of using the criteria of own society,
which has answered little, we would
use one standard of absolute truth —
- science.

legitimate doctor in America would
consider it. Instead, the removal of
a perfectly good heart from a
perfectly healthy body is limited to
the back alleys of America in a
practice that is considered at best
occult, at worst satanic.

By declaring that the entire fetus
has no inherent value, we do ignore
that the fetus has a heart and a
mind, as well as an appendix, but
the solution remains clean and
simple. That’s all we’re after, right?

Now the answer to abortion is
easy. Should a woman have an
abortion? Of course she should!
We should encourage it. Why
should any woman have to endure
childbirth. Well, it’s sort of like
removing a tumor or an appendix.
Sort of.

Whereas cancer or internal
hemorrhage takes life, pregnancy
creates it, but there I go again
trying to dirty things up with

Science should not concern itself with
“When does life begin?” It is a philosophy
question. Instead of considering when life
begins for the fetus, we should redirect our
attention on how it should end.

~....r y-..u .-.--.-* -..

I must admit that this idea of
using science to solve the question
of abortion is not entirely original.
As of now, science is trying to

determine where life begins. I
might also add they have been
somewhat unsuccessful. Science

should not concern itself with
“When does life begin?” It is a
philosophy question, and philosophy
has no business meddling in what
science can answer better.

Instead of considering when life
begins for the fetus, we should
redirect our attention on how it
should end.

Science will officially reclassify
the fetus as nothing more than an
organ, then go one step further and
declare it of no inherent value. All
of this is essential. No one today
questions a woman's right to have
her appendix removed. It’s her
body, she may do with it as she
pleases. However, if she were to
request that her heart be removed,
that would be a different story. No

technicalities that only cloud the
issue. I am quite confident that our
language and such can be
redesigned to tidy that little
oversight.

I promised you there would be

law and profits under science, and I
do not mean to deceive you. First,

no longer does the question of
abortion plague us. Yet after hearing
all that science can do for _us, it
seems like a small dividend now. I
can feel the greed in your hearts
now saying, “I want more.” I will
give it to you.

Second, this new fetus will
answer all of our, for lack of a
better expression, prayers. This little
bundle of joy, no pun intended, is
not just an organ, but a super organ.
Abortion clinics across America
have been fascinated, if not
frustrated, by its deceptive tactics
for rs. Science has filmed this
org‘ icking and ﬁghting against
its at tation. I have not researched
this point, but I do not know of any

other organ in the human anatomy
which will do this. Then, once
removed, this super organ simply
will not die on its own. Science
pours salt on top of it (this trick
does wonders with slugs), punctures
it, but usually the fetus requires
smashing the skull to kill it. Make
no mistake, this is one tough organ.

The real fun lies in what Mr.
Scientist is going to do with the
super organ. Science believes it will
cure Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,
diabetes, cancer and many diseases
that are presently unknown to him.
Here lies the real payoff, and its
effects would be nothing less than
-profound.

Sex, which has for so long been
the taboo subject in American life,
would now become its most
penetrating activity. And well it
should. The more sex, the more
fetuses, the more scientific, and the
closer man will become to his
ultimate achievement, immortality.

Sure, quite soon there will
simply be no need for children
because we will conquer death and
live forever. Children would simply
impede our individual freedom, our
careers, and the progress of our own
lives. We’ve all heard the
expression that we “are living at
the expense of our youth.” That’s
just some more philosophical talk.
We are living at the expense of the
old. More specifically, of our own
old, and by that I mean our own
old age. There is nothing, or
nobody who can take life away
from us but ourselves.

This is the ultimate goal of my
modem proposal.

Yet, instead of sounding like a
grand solution, it sounds like the
Final Solution. Instead of allowing
for free choice and the promotion of
freedom, our society is perpetrating
the biggest lie in the history of
mankind. In the United States alone,
legal abortions have claimed more
lives than Adolf Hitler, Joseph

Stalin, the rest of World War It, all
of World War I, and the war before
that one, and so on, and so on, etc.
We condemn Hitler, but what will
we do with ourselves? Millions of
souls are crying for justice, if we
don’t answer them, who will?

and relationships. It was intuitive, but it was
also extremely concrete.

In dealing with students Lee took a similar
tact. He believed that, so long as a student was
husbanding his parents’ resources, going to class
(and preferably to church), was acting soberly
and decently, passing his work, and not embar-
rassing the community, he was welcome to stay.

But, if he wasted his parents’ money (by not
going to class, or by spending too much, or by
drinking at local saloons), or if his examples of
“idleness and irregular attendance” at class
rubbed off on fellow students, Lee would invite
the student for an interview. If, after warnings
and letters to parents, a student persisted in such
behavior, Lee would send him home.

The same was true of students who brought
shame on the college — by harassing blacks, by
making students from the North feel uncomfort-
able, or by riotous behavior that disturbed oth-
ers. For Lee, being ,a gentleman meant far more
than simply not lying, not cheating and not
stealing. Lee tolerated no student for long who
caused another person pain or embarrassment, or
led others astray, or placed them in danger.

Lee believed that his boys should learn self-
control. He gave the students a wider measure of

self-govemment than previous generations had
enjoyed at the college. He abolished the long,
printed list of rules that had governed college
life for decades, realizing that codes of behavior
caused more harm than good and did not foster
patterns of self-control.

Lee replaced them with the rule that all stu-
dents must act as gentlemen — or leave. Lee
believed the old system, which required profes-
sors to spy on students, degraded both boys and
faculty members and destroyed relations between
them. Lee hoped that the students’ regard for
their own reputation plus their own concept of
duty would lead them to act correctly, respect
authority, and diligently pursue their work.

This done, one teacher said, Lee “exercised
a constant vigilance over the students." And
they probably required such oversight.

We tend to idealize Lee’s student body,
made up as it was by hardened veterans and
bashful boys who had been too young to serve.
Yet Lee’s faculty, though they respected the
boys, did not idealize them. .

Said one faculty member,“Irnrnediately after
the war, the young men of the South were wild
and unrestrained and acts of disorder were fre-
quent.” Some of Lee’s students, being “incur-

ably vicious,” as a faculty member noted, were
sent home with dispatch. Thankfully these num-
bered a tiny minority. But, of the rest, Lee
tamed most all of them. According to one teach-
er, Lee offered every student his fervent care,
nurture and protection, “like that of a father or
mother." When a problem arose, Lee could
combine firmness with tenderness. He offered
patience and leniency (even humor) for some;
stem reproofs for others. He considered each
boy as an individual. He was not a “stickler for
formal regulations.” Though usually lenient
when it came to “youthful indiscrction”(at times
he seems to have gotten a kick out of them),
Lee refused to tolerate “falsehood" or “mean-
ness.”

On the whole, however, Lee was more inter-
ested in elevating the character of an individual
student than in simply repressing vice. And his
system worked. A professor noted that by the
last years of Lee’s tenure “hardly a single case
of serious discipline occurred." Students had
learned self-govemment while tasting a portion
of self-government. .

‘Field of Doom’ claims another

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee men's
soccer team settled for a tie and
picked up a victory in two Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
games last week.

On Saturday, the
traveled to Norfolk. Against
perennial regional power Virginia
Wesleyan, W&L came back to even
the score from one goal deﬁcits in
each half and had two goals
nullified by the same linesman.

The Generals took a 1-0 lead 15
minutes into the contest when
freshman midfielder Reid Murphy
headed a throw-in from senior co-
captain Patrick Brown into the left
side of ?the net.

The Blue Marlins knotted the
score at 1-1 minutes later. Stoppage
of play for a yellow card resulted in
a lapse of concentration. When
action resumed, Virginia Wesleyan
immediately put the ball past junior
goaltender Jon Bull.

Ten minutes later, Virginia
Wesleyan went up 2-1 on a shot off
of a deﬂected ball.

With a few minutes remaining in
the first half, W&L scored its
second goal. After breaking away
with the ball from midﬁeld and
outrunning the Blue Marlins’
sweeper, sophomore David De Falco
chipped the ball over a charging
goalkeeper from the top of the
penalty box for his first goal of the
season.

Generals

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

It has been a relatively injury
free year in games that the
Washington and Lee football team
has played in. Up until this past
week, only Rich Poli had sustained
0 a serious injury in games W&L has
played.

On Saturday, despite a fine
4 defensive effort from the Generals
and an almost perfect execution of
an offense by Hampden-Sydney, the
[play that stands out most was an
‘ injury.

In the middle of the third period,

9 after driving almost the length of
‘the ﬁeld, H-SC I-back Len
Amistrong carried for a gain of six,
,but was hit and fumbled. W&L’s
Scott Williamson recovered. On the
‘play, Armstrong was injured and
&remained on the ground, motionless
for close to 15 minutes receiving

medical attention before he was
taken to the hospital for x—rays.
Both head coaches and training

staffs looked on to make sure that
g the injury was not a serious one.
Said Generals’ head coach Gary
«Fallon, “We got word after the
game that the young man is alright.
‘*1 don’t like to see anyone go down
.. like that. It looked like he got hit
from behind and from the front,
‘with the force coming from the
‘front, and he could have hurt his
lower back.

that it wasn’t

The Generals then began to find
their rhythm as they dominated play
for the rest of the half.

W&L tied the score again when
freshman Mike Mitchem delivered a
rolling pass to senior Rick Silva,
who drilled the ball into the net
from six yards away.

With the score tied at 3-3, W&L

sent the ball into the Virginia
Wesleyan goal two more times.
Each time the head referee

signalled the goal as legitimate, but
each time a linesman ruled that the
Generals were offsides. After
conferring with the linesman, the
referee did not allow the goals to
stand.

W&L head coach Rolf Piranian
said that one of the goals should
have counted.

“There's no question that we
were onsides for the first one,” he
said.

Neither team had decisive
scoring opportunities in the overtime
period and W&L walked away with
its second tie of the season, 3-3.

On a cold, wet, and gray
afternoon at what has become a
Field of Doom for W&L opponents.
W&L opponents had mustered only
a tie in five attempts to defeat the
Generals at home this season.

Although Eastern Mennonite’s
record is 4-11 (1-5 in the ODAC),
they had only allowed 19 goals in
their first 14 games. A big reason
for the Royals’ stingy defense is
junior goaltender Jeremy Nafziger
who had only allowed 1.36 goals

serious for any young man in any
sport. You don’t like to see that
kind of injury because it takes away
from the game of football itself.”

Things started very well for the
Generals. On the Tigers first play
from scrimmage, Armstrong fumbled
going into the line and junior free
safety Clark Wight recovered on the
H-SC 37-yard line.

The Fling-tum Phl, October 19, 1989

per game.

Eastern Mennonite scored the
only goal of the first half at the
23:28 mark when sophomore Cory
Longacre streaked down the right
side with the ball before sending to
the middle of the penalty box to
teammate Ken Beidler, who directed
his shot off Bull’s outstretched arms
into the goal. .

In the second half, the Generals
simply dominated the action, and
sent shot after shot in the direction
of Nafziger, who made 15 saves
during the contest.

Yet with 2:50 remaining in the
game, W&L received another
penalty shot. In a substitution
mixup, the Royals were short three
players as the Generals were about
to take a comer kick. To avoid
playing short-handed, a Royal
defenseman reached up and grabbed
the ball in the penalty box. This
time, sophomore David Hooker took
the free kick and sent into the right
side of the net to tie the game at 1-
1.

At the 1:10 mark the Royals got
their only shot of the second half —
and made it count as Beidler sent it
into the back of the goal for a 2-1
lead for Eastern Mennonite.

While Nafziger and a teammate
were trying to kill the ﬁnal minute
of playing time, Murphy caught the
pair asleep. The freshman rushed at
Nafziger, knocked the ball loose
with a slide tackle, popped back to
his feet and left-footed the ball into
an empty net with 39 seconds to go

forcing a ﬁeld goal attempt from
junior Carter Quayle. Quayle’s
attempt from 36 yards out was no
good, and the Generals were turned
away.

Early in the second quarter, H-
SC’s David Brickhill was no good
on a 47-yard field goal attempt, and,
much the same as W&L’s game
against Centre, the defenses took

Sampson was sacked on third down,

Late in the first half though, the

Quarterback Dwayne Bowyer,
starting in place of injured Ben
Comer (broken collar bone), for _the
Tigers, ran seven yards on first
down and found tight end John
Jewell for 13 yards on second
down. After a time out,. Bowyer
found Armstrong for 24 yards down
to the W&L four, and three plays
later, Armstrong scooted into the
end zone from one yard out to
provide the Tigers all the points
they would need with 23 seconds
left in the half.

“I thought our defense played
quite well at times,” said Fallon.
“We missed some scoring
opportunities and left our defense
out on the field too long in the
heat. [The heat’s] no excuse, but
you just can’t allow your defense to
be on the field that long, and I
think they got worn down a little
bit.”

To start the second half, the
Generals took the kickoff and made
their only sustained drive, going
from their own 12 to the Hampden-
Sydney 40. On first down from the
40, Pope carried for 10 tough yards,
but fumbled fighting for extra yards,
and the Tigers recovered. .

On the Tigers’ ensuing drive.
following a 26 yard completion
from Bowyer to Tony Thomas on
second and 16 to the W&L 33,
Armstrong fumbled. Williamson
recovered for W&L and returned to
the W&L 20.

Tough defense not enough

in 2-0 loss to

Lynchburg

By John Dukes
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
volleyball team started slow and
then rallied last week in winning
three out of four matches, including
two in Old Dominion Athletic
Conference play.

Said Generals head coach Susan
Dittman, “I think We’re back on
track now. We’re ecstatic about our
win over Roanoke. We've gotten
super play from Lisa Jay, and Mena
McGowin has been outstanding.
We’re hoping it continues.”

The Generals showed their
strength in coming from behind
after losing two of the first three
games of their ODAC match against
Roanoke College. The final scores
were 4-15, 15-12, 9-15, 16-14, 15-
12.

Against Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College, the Generals’
strong play posted game scores of
17-15, 15-13, 15-6. They easily
handled Catholic by scores of 15-5,
15-11.

On Tuesday, the Generals visited
Harrisonburg to take on ODAC
power Eastern Mennonite. The
Generals fought hard but lost in
three straight games after leading in
two.

Sophomore Mena McGowin’s
turned in an outstanding week,
registering 42 kills in the first three
games. She also has a .2A7 attack

 

Mena McGowin

percentage, which ranks her among
the ODAC leaders. Connie
Papazickos and Rashrni Sachan have
also been the teams top servers,
with percentages of .939 and .935,
respectively. ’

The Generals are overall 6-12,
and 4-2 in ODAC competition.

The Generals are fighting in a
tight race in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference as they are in
third place behind unbeaten leaders
Bridgewater, and Eastern Mennonite.

The Generals will next be in
ODAC action on October 20 at

,home against Hollins and Guilford

at 6:00 p.m. The Generals will
travel to Sweet Briar for a
conference game on Tuesday before
returning home to entertain ODAC

After the delay, the Generals
could not muster any real scoring
opportunities, and the Tigers put the
game away in the fourth quarter
with a 32 yard ﬁeld goal after the
Generals were offsides on a fourth-
and-one. To nail the coffin shut,
Bowyer went in for the fmal score
on a four-yard run on fourth and
goal to make the score 17-0.

Said Fallon, “It just looked like
it wasn’t to be on this given day."

Junior safety Brad Miller turned
in a tearn-leading performance for
the Generals defense, registering 15
tackles. Sophomore defensive end
John McCallum was in on 13
tackles as well.

Next the Generals, now 3-3, 1-2
in conference play, will make the
trip across Termessee to Sewanee.
The Generals will be battling a bit
of the injury bug. Senior comerback
Bland Warren, who did not play
against Hampden-Sydney is again
doubtful with a neck problem.
Junior slot back Carl Gilbert broke
a ﬁnger and is doubtful, and senior
quarterback Chris Smythe broke his
nose and will not play.

Last year, in a game that was
closer than the score would indicate,
the Generals beat the Tigers 21-0.

they were knocking at our doorstep,
but our defense was able to keep
them out before we got a chance to
do something offensively."

Volleyball comes on strong
for close conference wins

By Holly Goodlng
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
wornen’s soccer team continues to
play well defensively, but a lack of
scoring has continued to hurt the
team.

On Saturday, the Generals
traveled to Greensboro where they
took on Guilford College. The team
played well, but was unable to
score. The defense saved the day, as
junior goalie Sherri Brown pitched
her fifth shutout of the season,
giving the Generals a 0-0 deadlock.

Despite the lack of goals, head
coach Jan Hathom was not
disappointed. “I was really pleased
with the game. It was fun because
we played well and I was proud of
our effort. However, we are still
having problems generating our
attack.”

The Generals took on Lynchburg
College at home on Tuesday in an
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
game. The game was a very even,
very sportsmanlike game.

The ﬁnal statistics showed that
the game was closely played — each
team was credited with six shots on
goal and each goalie recorded four
saves.

Lynchburg, however, led in the
only category that mattered, the
score. The first goal of the game

came with seven and a half minutes
left to go in the first half, when the
Lynchburg team broke away with
the ball, and triple-teamed All-
ODAC sweeper Nancy Mitchell,
who was unable to save the day as
a Lynchburg forward broke free and
one-tirned the ball past Brown for
the only goal of the half.

Lynchburg took some of the
steam out of the Generals play by
scoring a second goal with about
fifteen minutes left in the game.

On a free kick, a Hornet player
was left unguarded in front of the
goal and put the ball past a diving
Brown. The Generals offense was
never able to get going, and
Lynchburg prevailed 2-0.

Hathom was nevertheless pleased
with the game. “The team played
hard, and it was a tough game.
The second goal took some wind
out of us, but we played well. We
have learned a lot and we learn
more with each game. We have a

good team.”

The Generals, 4-5-3, 2-3-1 in
ODAC play, will play their final
home game of the season was
played this afternoon against arch-
rival Hollins College. On Tuesday,
the ODAC tournament begins. The
Generals will likely be matched up
with Roanoke Salem in a game to
be played in Salem.

Polo falters at Annapolis

 

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee water
polo team returned from last
weekend's trip to the Southeastern
Varsity Invitational tournament
poorer of record, but richer in the
knowledge that they could compete
with and beat some of the nation's
best teams.

The unranked Generals managed
to subdue 20th-ranked Bucknell,
taking some sting out of their first
losses of the year at the hands of
15th-ranked Brown and 19th—ranked
Harvard. “They believe in
themselves now,” said. head coach
Page Remillard. “They don’t like
losing.”

The tournament began poorly, as
Brown trounced W&L by a score of
15-3. The Generals jumped out to
an early lead, but by halftime
Brown was controlling the game.
According to Remillard, his team
was hurt by their unfamiliarity with
the regulation size pool that the
tournament was played in.

A regulation size pool, which
Brown has, is as wide as
Washington and Lee’s pool is long.

The second game went
considerably more to the liking of
the many W&L fans who were in
Annapolis, as the Generals
regrouped to beat Bucknell 9-6.
Sophomore Alan Herrick echoed
his scoring explosion against
Richmond three weeks ago with a
four goal, two steal effort.
Classmate Jay Smith had two goals,

and junior Tomas Perez, sophomore
Will Davis, Scott Strader, and
freshman Scott Strader. Perez added
two assists.

Senior goalie David Olson
distinguished himself as well, with
eights blocks and a team-high three
steals.

However, it was the final game
that the team will remember most, a
12-6 loss to Harvard. It was a game
that was much closer than the score
would indicate. “We're frustrated,”
said Remillard. “We could have
beaten Harvar .”

 

“They believe In
themselves now.
They don ’t like
losing.”

—Page Flemillard

Indeed, with two minutes to go
in the first half, a W&L victory
looked very possible. The teams
were tied at four-all, until Harvard
scored the first of what would be
seven unanswered goals.

Six of these nails in the W&L
coffin came in the third quarter, in
which W&L could not muster a
goal. The third quarter lapse was a
symptom of the disease that
afﬂicted Washington and Lee all
tournament long: the inability to
play at their customary high level
right after halftime.

‘ ‘We‘ve talked about the
importance of the third quarter, but
it hasn’t helped,” Remillard said.

i

For the tournament, W&L wits
outscored by a frightening 13'-2
margin in the third quarter. ‘ ‘ They
scored on our mistakes,” said
Remillard. “They got the game
under control from turnovers on our
part. We weren’t ready for the
overall intensity of the game.” .
He added that the tearn’s overall

youth wasn‘t a factor in the third

quarter meltdown, choosing inste d
to credit Harvard with helping
create W&L breakdowns. 1 V,‘
Remillard saw the team;/S
troubles capsulized in the probler 5
of the goalie. “David Olson is 0
leader,’’ he said. “He got upset [in

the third quarter] and lost focus. V;*,=_ V

lost control of ourselves and thus
the game because we weren't used
to losing. We’ve come from behird
before this year and we needed to
remember that.” '

However, Remillard was very
pleased with the way the team came
back in the fourth quarter. “W'e
figured out our mistakes too late,
but we figured therri out,” he said.

“In the third quarter we let
down and got killed," explaine
Davis. “We came out in the fourth
quarter like it was a new game. We
wanted to win the fourth quarter t
prove to ourselves that we shoul
have won the game.”

Next week, W&L, now 12-2 0
the season, goes to Richmond fo

the Southern Tournament,
tournament that will establish th
seedin gs for the Conferenc -

championships that follow in tw
weeks.

Where is Margaritaville?

By Chris Swann
Staff Reporter

In an age where celebrities
publish books left and right, mostly
to backstab each other or to get a
buck, one famous music personality
has written a collection of "fictional
facts and factual fictions," a
romantic, hilarious and often
touching work dealing with dreams
coming true, love found, lost and
found again, and the search for an
elusive "Margaritaville," an island
paradise "sung into creation" by the
author more than a decade ago.
This book, Tales From
Margaritaville, is written by none
other than Jimmy Buffett, singer
and songwriter of "Margaritaville,"
"Son of a Son of a Sailor," and
countless other songs known by
heart by Parrotheads (Buffett fans)
everywhere. For those of you who
wear ﬂip-ﬂops and shorts in the
dead of winter, have baseball caps
with shark fins attached to them,
and love to sip frozen tropical
drinks while playing a Jimmy
Buffett tape, you will find this book
to be a fantastic collection of stories
written by a familiar friend that
complements his music well. For
those of you who do not like
Jimmy Buffett music (God help
you), you will still find this to be
an entertaining piece of southern

.l  » . - .
_ E; .<.‘dIllir
T’ liriiiiiiigll

literature, the best to have come out  '3

in a long while.

Jimmy Buffett, the creator of
"drunk Caribbean rock and roll" as
he _calls it, has been one of the
most original musical performers in
the past twenty years, blending
reggae, calypso, country, jazz and
rock to create a distinctive style all
his own. But Mr. Buffett has also
written fiction and non-fiction in the
past; he published The Jolly Mon, a
children’s book, with his daughter
Savannah Jane in 1988, and he has
written several articles urging the
environmental preservation of the
Florida coastline and the manatee in
the Miami Herald and other
newspapers and magazines. Tales
From Margaritaville, however, is his
first fictional work aimed at an

. adult audience.

In his book, Jimmy Buffett has
created the fictional settings of
Snake Bite Key and Heat Wave,
Alabama, as the background for a

series of fictional short stories. He
v has captured a gypsy—1ike spirit
looking for sunshine and new

places, a romantic desire to see the
ocean and lead a happy life, and
has transformed these feelings into
his characters, such as Tully Mars,
the Wyoming cowboy who leaves
his old life behind him to take his
horse across the U.S. to find the
ocean and the island paradise of his
dreams in "Take Another Road";
Romeo Fleming, former New York
Giants football player and now part-
time English teacher turned football
coach who makes his Heat Wave
High Lizards into an inspired team
in "Off To See The Lizard"; Jim

~ Gregario Fuentes,

Delaney, the young man who takes
an incredible road trip with his hell-
raising Uncle Billy in "The
Pascagoula Run"; and Isabella, the
wandering Caribbean beauty
searching for a home and finding
love in "I Wish Lunch Could Last
Forever." It is not by accident that
these titles are the same as those of
songs off of Buffett’s new album,
"Off To See The Lizard;" the two
works were written simultaneously,
and the songs are shorter musical
versions of the stories themselves.
Some of these stories are also taken
from the author’s past experiences
as a music man and travelling

romantic, dealing with his "old
pirate buddies," a trip to the
Yucatan Peninsula with his
daughter, the author’s encounter

with Buffett’s fictional hero Freddy
Fishsticks, and an emotional meeting
in Havana between Buffett and

inspiration for Ernest Hemingway’s
The Old Man and the’Sea.

What makes this book great as a
whole is how the characters and
their wishes are tied in with each
other. Each of these people have
unique personalities and means of
expressing themselves, but Buffett
has given them the same basic
desire, a want to live out their
dreams in a world full of growing
condominiums and nouveau riche
entrepreneurs interested in money.
He has blended myth and reality
well, showing his characters grow
and change as they appear in more
than one story. Eugene "Balls"

Rawls and Willett Rainer Snow,
Buffett’s football heroes from "Off
To See The Lizard," are found later
and years older in "The Swamp
Creature Let One In," taking their
frustrations of age out on the golf
course and reminiscing about the
old glory days. Buffett creates a
great antagonism between Rawls and

represents what Jimmy Buffett calls
the "condo commando", a species
found all over Southern Florida
wearing wraparound shades and
hideous Hawaiian shirts,

money and prowess at the golf
course. This is an extremely funny
story, culminating in a five-thousand
dollar bet between Rawls and
Huckle on a hole—in—one, and it also
shows how an older man tries to
recaptgggsome of the fun and glory
of his youth. T

Jimmy’ Buffett has often been
asked, "Where is Margaritaville?"
He shows us in his book that
Margaritaville isn't as much a place
as it is a state of mind, a fulfillment
of one’s deep—seated dreams and
fantasies. Buffett takes his
characters through whirlwind lives
of laughter and tears as they search
for this state of mind, and he makes
his readers laugh and cry along with
Tully Mars, "Balls" Rawls and
himself in this incredible collection
of short stories written by a man
who’s literary ability will surprise
and please both his music fans and
his new reading audience as well.

ROTC sponsors rapelling

By Kevin Carl
Staff Reporter

“Lane One, On rappel!” came
the cry from the top of the VMI
cliffs. “Lane One, On Belay!”
came the response from below.
With that W&L student Jennifer
Fischer began her rappel down the
VMI cliffs during the open rappel
on Wednesday, October 4.

The event was sponsored by the
W&L Army ROTC department in
order to give W&L students the
opportunity to try something new
and challenging.

“I didn’t know how it would
go,” said Jennifer Lohse, a
freshman. “I‘m usually afraid of
heights, but I soon realized as long
as I concentrated on where I was
going I’d be okay. Having the
support and encouragement of the
people there helped me overcome
my fear, and rappel down the
cliffs.”

John Suttle, an experienced
rappeler from Abilene, Texas said

C'.’i‘.InICl‘p1lI’lS, Crystal has managed a.
move beyond weak movie scripts
and shallow comic roles. Say all
you want about Eddie Murphy or
Chevy Chase, but I think that Billy
Crystal is the first SNL veteran to
prove his skills as a serious actor.
l’ll admit that Crystal is funny in
the movie. But his humor is bitter-
sweet, and he gives a honest
performance as a man who doesn't
know if he can really love another
women.

Meg Ryan also turns in a fine
performance. She seems to have
made a career, in films like "Top
Gun"‘and "The Presidio," of playing
rebellious girls with a heart of gold.
She moves beyond her: earlier
typecasting and perhaps elicits as
much sympathy as Crystal. Carrie
Fisher, of "Star Wars" fame, rounds
out the cast as Marie, Sally‘s single
friend who will try anything to
escape from the hostile world of
singles bars. Fisher makes a
noteworthy attempt of avoiding her
"Star Wars" stereotype.- Yet I can
never look at her on screen and not
wonder what Darth Vader is doing.

My job is not to reveal the plot
twists of the movie. Unfortunately,
unless you have lived in the C-
School for the past month, your
friends will have already ruined the
infamous deli scene. I’m going to
behave myself and refrain fron

my Met Sally: pure class

commenting on the scene. I will
remark, however, that it .is the
comedic climax of the film, and
Sally teaches us males a valuable
lesson. No man who sees "When
Harry Met Sally" will ever make
rash statements about others again.
"When Harry Met Sally" is one
of the best films of the year. I
don’t care if it doesn't have car
chases, Jack Nicholson, graphic
violence, or Prince. This film is
pure class from beginning to end.

The movie soundtrack itself is
superb and features Louis
Armstrong, Bing Crosby, Frank
Sinatra, Ray Charles, Harry
Connick, jr., and Ella Fitzgerald.
You can keep Prince and his
Batman videos, I'll take Louis

Armstrong any day of the week.

I tried and tried, but could not
find one fault in the film. Reiner
not only makes the audience laugh,
but he also delivers an important
message on relationships. Billy
Crystal and Meg Ryan make the
most unlikely, yet perfect, screen
couple since Katherine Hepburn and
Spencer Tracy. Peppers grades
"When Harry Met Sally" a solid
 The movie is rated "R" for
language and mild sexual content,
and is playing at the State Theater.
Forget that tonight is not "cheap
night," go out and see the film
before it disappears.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

LEX|NGTON,V|RGlN|A

OCTOBER 26, 1989

By Spain Brumby

'. Staff Reporter

This weekend over 800 families are
expected to attend the thirty-fifth annual
Parents’ Weekend at Washington and Lee.

Parents’ Weekend, which is coordinated
by the Development Office, will feature

’ several activities designed to familiarize the

entire family with the Washington and Lee
community.

Lex McMillan, an alumnus and W&L’s
Director of Development, said, “It’s very

who have relation to W&L have an oppor-
tunity to become acquainted with the peo-
ple who live and work here.”

President John Wilson and his wife
Ann will hold a reception at Lee House for
freshman and their parents from 4 to 5:30
p.m. Friday. This reception will provide
an opportunity for students and parents to
meet the Wilsons and to tour the historic
Lee House, where Robert E. Lee and his
farrlily lived during his presidency.

Also on Friday, there will be a Choral
Ensembles and University Wind Ensemble
concert in Lee Chapel. The concert for

ances by the University Chorus, the Glee
Club, the Women’s Chorus, Southem Com-
fort and JubiLee. Lindsay DeHaven, a ju-
nior and member of the University Chorus,
the Women’s Chorus, and JubiLee.said she
is looking forward to the concert.

“It’s always one of the best perform-
ances because the parents are so supportive
and enthusiastic,” she said.

On Saturday at 11:30 a.m., Wilson will
deliver his “Report to Parents" in Lee
Chapel. Wilson will discuss the state of
Washington and Lee and inform parents of
the progress in the administration. Follow-

els composed of an administrator, a faculty
member and a student available to answer
any questions parents might have about
Washington and Lee.

On Saturday and Sunday, the University
Theatre will feature its season opener,
“The Body Shop.” This musical comedy,
written by Washington and Lee drama
Prof. Tolri Ziegler, will be at 3 and 8 p.m.
in the University Theatre, located on the
comer of Henry and Main streets. Junior
Karen Meyers, stage manager for “The
Body Shop,” says the play is “fun for the
whole family."

W&L’s annual Parents’ Weekend to begin tomorrow

W&L students, $6 for adults and $4 for
other students and senior citizens. Those
wishing to attend are advised to call ahead,
as some shows may already be sold out.

For most students, it is not the various
activities which make Parents’ Weekend
special, but it is the parents. Many students
have not seen their parents in eight weeks
and are looking forward to this family re-
union. Matt Moberg, a freshman from San
Francisco, is especially excited about see-
ing his family. “I want to hear all the
details of the earthquake. Also, I would

and Colleges, which recognizes out-
standing student leaders.

Campus nominating committees
and editors of the annual directory
have included the names of these

students based on their academic

achievement, service to the commu-
leadership in extracurricular

 activities and potential for continued

success.

Of the 45 W&L students
included in the 1990 volume, 33 are
seniors in the university's under-
graduate divisions, while 12 are stu-
dents in W&L School of Law.

the anticipated profit to “be used for a charity around

The proposed budget, which EC President Willard
Dumas said the EC must still vote on, is based only
on the costs of the Friday night ball itself. It includes
$25,000 for entertainment, $15,000 for souvenirs and
$17,250 for decorations.

The total revenues are based on projected sales of
1,300 tickets at $40 each, 2,200 T-shirts for $9 each,

IFC gives funds to Contact, Spectator, SAB

By Brian Root
Senior Copy Editor

The Interfratemity Council allo-
cated more than $20,000 to the
Spectator, Contact, the SAB and the
Health Education Committee at its
meeting Tuesday night.

The IFC Judicial Board voted to
give $1,200 to the Spectator. This is
the first time the IFC has given
money to a campus publication.

“It is the IFC’s responsibility to
contribute to different avenues of
communication,” said IFC Vice
President Hunt Neidringhaus.

The Spectator published its first
issue of the school year last week.

Last year, the magazine did not
receive funding from the Washing-
ton and Lee Publications Board. The
magazine, in the opinion of the
Publications Board, was a “duplica—
tion of efforts,” meaning that exist-
ing publications already fufilled
needs the Spectator planned to ad-
dress.

Paul Lagarde, editor of the Spec-
tator, said the magazine would not
be under any sort of control from
the IFC as a result of the funding.

Lagarde said although he and the
magazine's publisher, Ray Welder,

plan to petition the Publications
Board for money this year, he does
not expect the request to be granted.

The IFC also granted $13,000 to
Contact, a student-run organization
which brings speakers to W&L each
year.

Last week, the IFC delayed vot-
ing on the budget request pending a
presentation from Contact to the
whole IFC, including representatives
from each fraternity.

Contact's entire budget totals
$31,000, according to Contact Co-
Chairman Thomas Sheehan, the oth-
er $18,000 having been given by
the Executive Committee.

“We would like to start holding
receptions for each speaker in frater-
nity houses this year,” said Shee-
han. “I think that would help frater-
nities with their relations with peo-
ple outside the W&L community.”

Sheehan said Contact would wel-
come more suggestions from frater-
nity members as to what speakers
should be invited.

Fraternities have previously paid
$10 for each member to Contact.
Under the new arrangement, each
house would pay $12 for each
member, and the IFC would make
up the difference.

The IFC also decided to help the

SAB pay for at least one, and pos-
sibly two, concerts this year.
According to Applcbaumi the
"IFC agreed to make up whatever
losses the SAB might incur for both

concerts, as long as the losses did
not exceed $5,000, so that the SAB
would show no loss.

Finally, the IFC gave $1,350 to
the Health Education committee for
the promotion of Alcohol Awareness
Week. The IFC paid for the sound
system at the Battle of the Bands
last Friday at the student pavilion.

“I heard the event went really
well out at the pavilion,” IFC Presi-
dent Kevin Nash said.”

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, October 26, 1989

The Se|f—Study
is a stilted study

Something very important happened last week, and many
Washington and Lee students didn’t even know it. With a
loud thud, a two-volume, 440-page monstrosity fell in the
laps of W&L’s trustees. Its name is the Washington and Lee
Long Range Plan, more commonly known as the Self-Study.

The study was tagged by its authors as a comprehensive
look at our college; it is said to include opinions from
faculty and students. But, with all due respect to the study’s
authors, we hope the trustees went in with shovels drawn.
While the study does contain some good ideas, most of it
seems devoid of ﬁscal realism and student input.

We realize that the purpose of a self-study is to come up
with a list of needs, and perhaps it is appropriate that the
authors were concerned more with what they would like
W&L to have than with what W&L should pay to get. But
we hope the trustees realize that this list must be pared
down. Far too many of its suggestions are justified by
statements like this one dealing with residence life programs:
“Compared to other colleges, we are greatly understaffed and
underfinanced.” That other schools spend money for
something is hardly a reason we should also.

There is throughout the document an undercurrent of
animosity toward the importance of fraternities at today's
W&L, none-too-subtly veiled as an effort to build class unity.
For example, the study labels as “essential” the moving of
fraternity rush to the winter. And, in an attempt to provide
places other than fraternity houses where students may gather,

the study calls for the building of a new student center. That »

building would include not only a new Co—op, which we do
need, but also vast lounge areas, which we don’t. Even
though W&L’s sororities, the prime users of Fairfax Lounge,
seem well on their way to building lodges of their own, and
even though Gaines Hall and the University Center provide
ample space for other campus groups, the study’s authors
would like to see another Fairfax, or another Arlington
Women’s Center. Given that the use of these places by
sororities will end as soon as lodges go up, we would be
hard-pressed to find two more under-used facilities on
campus; now the self-study says we need a third.

This idea and others indicate the study’s authors do not
understand that W&L is a university, not a small college.
The “W&L community” is in fact a collection of many
intersecting communities composed of students from across
the nation and around the world, most from different frater-
nities and sororities, with many different interests and from
many different backgrounds. To deny this is to deny the very
nature of Washington and Lee.

Getting back to the bucks, it seems the authors included
every idea they considered “good,” regardless of costs.
Among other things, the study suggests adding six employees
to the staff of the Dean of Students; expanding services
designated for minority students; creating a committee to
track women’s needs; renovating virtually every building on

i campus; and hiring new professors from’-oneeend of the’

campus to Zthe other. These may sound “like neai ta?-,;.s,‘"‘%m;
they will cost‘ an awful lot of time, and money.

To be fair to the study’s authors, they did consider where
this money will come from. And, as you might guess, they
didn’t suggest cuts in their salaries as an option. To quote
from the study, “Our students deserve the best. Their
families are, with certain exceptions, able to pay for it.”

That’s right. the answer to the funding question is higher
tuition. The study goes to great pains to justify an increase
by comparing W&L’s tuition to the tuition charged by
“institutions we select as comparable.” And guess what? The
average comes out to be higher than W&L’s tuition.

The study is generous; it suggests that W&L charge only
85 percent of that average. But, since the present rate is 73
percent, W&L could gouge its parents for a hefty increase
and still keep tuition well below the average for “compara-
ble” institutions. Why hang on to that “Best Buy” ranking
when we can build a new Fairfax Lounge instead?

We encourage all W&L students to sift through this docu-
ment; a copy is at the University Library’s main desk. No
doubt you will find some of its ideas worth supporting. But
we also predict you will find things you dislike, particularly
if you're concerned about how they are paid for.

And we urge the trustees to refuse to accept this pipe-
dream as gospel. Seek student opinions before you spend a
dime. Realize that, while some students may have had
something to do with this document in its infancy, any
student contributions have gone through quite a ﬁlter.

In sum, while there are good ideas in the Self-Study, there
are also bad ones. We hope W&L’s trustees will get first-
hand help from students in trying to see the difference.

MY VIEW
By Taylor Sanders

EDITOR'S NOTE: At a memorial
service marking the 119th
anniversary of the death of Gen.
Robert E. Lee, Washington and Lee
history Prof. Taylor Sanders spoke
on Lee and his legacy. The words
that follow are adapted from that
address.

On this page last week, I
discussed the ethics of Lee and how
they guided his policies as president
of Washington College. Remember
that the general was a Evangelical
Christian and a Victorian gentleman.
Unlike members of the South's
“Bowie Knife and pistol gentry,”
Lee had his own more gentle social
and ethical code, based on
self—denia1 and self-control.

In applying that code to his
—+

 L” 

students, Lee would place relation-
ships over rules, values above ab-
stractions, and community over
codes. The other person rather than
any abstraction forged the iron core
of Lee’s approach. For example, a
professor once told the General that
a decision regarding a student would
upset precedent and that precedent
must be preserved. Lee answered
that when it comes to yotmg people
one should respect the person more
than the precedent.

We can find evidence of this in
Lee’s great decision — the one
Douglas Southall Freeman said
“Lee was born to make” — to
resign his commission in the Union
army. In the abstract, Lee believed
that slavery was both a “moral and
a political evil” as damaging to the
whites who practiced it as to the
blacks who suffered under it. As an

No quarters
in purgatory

As I ascended the stairs leading out of the
hot and steamy dungeon of hell, I realized that
I had a bone to pick with the persons in
charge of maintenance in this commonly fre-
quented locality in Gaines, the laundry room.
LI must say this spot is comparable to purgatory
for a number of reasons besides the tempera-
ture: laundry, in itself, is a chore and a night-
mare to every college student, but my grief is
compounded by the fact that the change ma-
chine is never functioning. From the very be-
ginning of this school year (literally, I mean
the first day my feet touched W&L soil on
Sept. 1), this ever-so-important machine, vital
to the cleanliness of appearance to so many
students, has been “out of order.”

I would like to propose a new laundry
system that would be much more effective,
even though it would be slightly expensive to
change from the old system of using quarters.
In the long run, however, the benefits would
be enormous. (I honestly think that our school
can afford a new system and owes it to its
students, especially since we were ranked as
the number one best buy in a liberal arts edu-
cation in the Oct. 16 issue of U.S. News and
World Report.) I think our coin-operated laun-
dry machines should be converted to charge
card machines. A similar process has already
been installed in the library with the copying
machines. Instead of relying on quarters, stu-
dents would be able to insert a magnetic-strip
card with a designated amount of charges into
the laundry machines. Just think, you could
charge this home too! This process would eli-
minate the headaches of the change machine,
stop people from using the post office’s stamp
machine for change, and relieve the bookstore
workers from furnishing students change for
laundry. Hopefully someone important will hear
and understand my plea before my laundry
piles up too high!

Women only?

Ordinarily, I am not one to jump up on the
soap box, but an advertisement in your Oct. 12
issue forced my hand. The ad is for a discus-
sion of “the feminine images of God" with
the unusual title, “Our Mother Who Art In
Heaven." The discussion is open to all wom-
en students, faculty, and staff of the W&L
community.

My Wednesday nights are booked; I doubt
I would go if I were invited, but that the lead-
ers of this organization feel privileged to ex-
clude half of the W&L community from their
controversial meeting counters many principles
this decade has tried to instill. Since women's
groups have led that battle, it seems particular-
ly hypocritical that the leaders of this particular

 

LETTERS

group would sponsor a weekly women’s—only
event.

Maybe the attendees of this event don’t
share the exclusive bent of the organizers, but
to the latter I say, “Ladies, you seem to want
to have your cake and eat it, too.” It just
doesn’t work that way. While women and mi-
norities are fighting to eliminate discriminatory
behavior, what would motivate some in that
group to practice it on their own?

Editor, as manager of an enlightened cam-
pus newspaper, I believe you, too, bear some
of the responsibility for the content of the
advertisements you accept. If you would re-
consider running an ad for an organization
whose practices offended public policy, perhaps
you want to reconsider also the tacit approval
you have given this group.

There’s a big war in Richmond about wom-
en in VMI, among other issues. If a group of
women don't want to practice non-discrimina-
tion themselves, they demean the efforts of
women throughout the nation.

Sincerely,
James T. Feezell, Law ’92

in The Ring-tum Phi in no way indicates an

chasing the ad by the Phi’s editors.

EDITOR’S NOTE.‘ This letter was submitted

to The Ring-tum Phi staff before last Thurs-
day's runoff elections.

If I could offer any bit of advice to per-
spective candidates running for election at
W&L, it would be: AVOID USING PERSON-
AL PRONOUNSl In the past election for
freshman class president, my poster read:
“Why Vote for Him...When You Can Vote for
Kim." Now, I realize that I really should have
said, “Why Vote for Him/Her/The Other Can-
didaw (and. by the way, the ‘Him’ just hap-
pens to rhyme with my name, mind you) 
When You Can Vote for Kim.” That would
have been very ettective.

If one really wanted to ignore the fact that
another woman was running, that “Him" just
happened to rhyme with my name, and that
most people would understand that the pronoun
stood for all other candidates (a quick point of
English grammar: we use the third person pro-
noun when referring to all mankind — men and
women included); I suppose, not considering
all of this, one could convince oneself that my
rhyme had a malicious, conniving, feminist
intent. It certainly makes it more interesting if
I could be labeled a die-hard ultra feminist,
doesn’t it? I'm sorry for the disappointment,
but the reality isn‘t so exciting. I simply
wanted a catchy rhyme to convey the idea that
people should vote for me because I felt I was
the best candidate.

Let me say it more clearly, sexism is abso-_ T

lutely not an issue here, and it is ridiculous to’,
even entertain this thought. Candidates for
office should be judged according to their cre-
dentials, not their sex.

I am writing in response to Mr. Golden and
Mr. Ford’s letters supporting certain fratemi—
ties’ decisions to nominate girls from other,
schools for Homecoming Queen. They both

imply that since girls from other school spend‘ ’
quite a large amount of time at W&L, they are -‘~.

third of this school is female?

Respectfully, {
Lee Rorrer ’93

In response to John Ford's letter printed _in
the previous Ring-tum Phi on the Homecoming
Queen situation, I would like to say a few
words on coeducation here at Washington and
Lee.

Every student presently on this campus
made a commitment to W&L upon entrance to
this school to support the school’s decision to
make W&L a fully-coeducational school and
the decision to have an eventual 50-50 male-
female ratio. It is indeed fortunate that the
ratio will continue to promote equality, for as

the ratio evens out, the school will be able to '

be choosier in who it decides to accept. This
will make W&L a better school, pushing it up
to higher than 18th in the ranks.

The special relationship between W&L and
the surrounding girls’ schools should always
exist, but the girls form these schools are not
students at W&L and should not be thought of
as such. They should not receive the privileges
of students here, such as being chosen Home-
coming Queen. Assuming your high school
was coeducational, would your high school
have chosen a Homecoming Queen from anoth-
er high school? .

They have every right and, I hope they
continue, to be a part of the social life at
W&L. They do no have more of a place on
the campus than any student here at all. They
represent an outdated tradition —— a stagnation
in light of coeducation. If they wish to be
considered as Homecoming Queen candidates,
perhaps they should attempt to transfer.

post-World War I students, intent on
I‘ debunking the Victorians, had

' Lewis Smith preached the old high
minded values, most of the students

old—fashioned. They gave him a fair

into the spirit of the Roaring

It’s interesting to note that many
thoughtful southerriers during that
period also feared the loss of the
old positive Southern mores. C.
Varm Woodward points out that the
fear of becoming
“indistinguishable” from the North
and of being “submerged under a
national steamroller” of
materialistic, Yankee values haunted
the mind of the South in the early
thirties. W&L has been part of the
L national trend.

Lee built a community in the
, midst of a collapsed civilization. He
was surrounded by young men,
1 many of whom rankled under moral
, restraints. They came from
backgrounds marked by poverty,
I defeat and despair, along with a
collapsed secondary educational
system, waning parental authority

were bitter’. Some were wild and

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

Last year I celebrated Parent's
Weekend by writing a strongly-
worded article on the negative
aspects of having a mother. Since

then I have been beaten, bruised

and boycotted by hostile,
pocketbook-wielding middle-aged
mothers all over the world. These
women, who believe the sword is
mightier than the word processor,
think that strong-arm tactics can
change my anti-mother article plans
for Parents Weekend '89. So,
without wasting another word, I
reveal the obvious subject of this
article -- my dad (this one’s for
you, Mom). Yes, reader, it's time to
put the spotlight on the enigmatic

, Wardrobe

The Ring-tum Phl, October 26, 1989

The man who spawned Jon Sbar

man in the background.

The natural place to begin this
personality profile is, of course, in
the closet. In Dad’s closet there are
enough bell-bottom slacks, leather
sandals and fat ties to revive the
l960’s. Dad, who has the fashion
instincts of horse dung, keeps these
clothes in the closet because he
does not know how that they went
out of style two decades ago.
Maybe, someday I’ll steal all of this
stuff and open up a Hippie
Factory Outlet. So,
reader, the next time you find
yourself laughing at something I'm
wearing, keep in mind that good
fashion sense is a hereditary disease.

Leaving the closet, we move
down the stairs into the family
kitchen, a room where Dad spends a
lot of time eating breakfast cereal
out of giant salad bowls. If you ask

someone about Dad, even someone
who hardly knows him, they will
undoubtedly laugh and reply:“You
mean the guy who eats cereal out
of a salad boWl?” Here’s exactly
how he works: every morning about
7:30 Dad takes skim milk, three or
four different kinds of healthy
breakfast cereals (the granola kind
that looks and tastes like twigs and
din), two or three bananas, and
mixes it into a huge salad bowl. He
then proceeds to eat the concoction
with an army-sized spoon that-could
easily be used as a trench shovel.
Next we turn to the inevitable
subject of physical health. Unlike
most men his age who keep busy
working, watching television and

waiting for grandchildren, Dad is a I

fitness nut. His only vice is a strong
addiction to animal television
documentaries. However, Dad did

not become health conscious with
the trendy Crystal Lite “let's-go—on—
a- diet" aerobics generation. He was
‘riding his bike to work back in the
1970s when everyone, including
Jane Fonda, threw grapefruits at any
adult who had the nerve to ride his
bike in traffic.

Judging from Dad’s healthy
lifestyle, readers can imagine how
he reacts to me when I roll out of
bed after a late night and, at 11
a.m. with beer on my breath, head
down stairs for a bowl of Cap’n
Crunch and a day of idle television
viewing. Sometimes for fun he
wakes me up at 6 a.rri. to go

‘ jogging. He often asks me why I

can’t be more like Brutus (the
family dog) who is always ready to
wake up for a rim.

Unlike Mom who constantly
sends me letters and cookies, Dad

has only sent me one brief note
since I’ve been at college. The note
was scrawled on the bottom of a
letter from Mom. Here is an
excerpt:

Dear Jon.‘ Sorry we keep missing
each other on the phone. I had fun
hiking with you this summer...l hope
water polo is going well and you
are using your mountain bike a
lot...Today Brutus ﬂushed a deer, a
red-tailed hawk and a grouse while I
was running on a hiking trail in the
woods. See you soon, Dad

Because I am still financially
dependant on Dad, and hope to
remain that way at least until
middle age, I think it would be in
my best interest to end this article
at once. I hope all you mothers are
satisﬁed.

The dawning of theAge of Aquarius?

MY VIEW

By J. Cameron Humphries

I read recently that according to the New
Age hippies, ours is the Age of Aquarius.
To those scholars of the heavens, Aquarius

‘is the sign of love and hate. I remember

Mother taught me, “never fall in love with
an Aquarius for they will only break your
heart.” This age we are in, however, means
far more than love, hate, and motl1er’s ad-
monition; Aquarius is also the sign of de-
struction.

I do not know just exactly how long we
have been in the Age of Aquarius, the New
Age is not too terribly speciﬁc here; but I
cannot help but think it is an outgrowth of
“the lost generation” and the wide scale
disillusionment following the Great War.
Herriingway and Eliot, among many others
defined their generation as lost, hollow, and
physically and emotionally impotent, making
it unable to find meaning in existence. A
quick reading of the day's news painfully
reminds us that ours may not be a lost gen-
eration, but we remain far from found. Al-

though they were perhaps forerunners to this
Age of Aquarius, their prophetic words echo
far more truth of our society today, than
they did when our grandparents read them
some fifty years earlier. With today's prob-
lems of drugs, sex, violence, teenage sui-
cide, etc., in addition to being the lost gen-
eration, we are also the troubled. Perhaps
this is the Age of Aquarius; if so, why?

I remember fondly my junior year in
high school when I studied the beloved
American philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emer-
son. His irrirnortal mutation of the Socratic
Code is perhaps more the root cause of the
Age of Aquarius than Shirley McClaine and
her glowing rocks. When he said, “To thine
own self be true,” he sent America, much
less Western civilization on a crash course
for catastrophe. Later James and the other
American Pragrnatists would extend this
intellectual and philosophical blasphemy, but
the Age of Aquarius begins with the radical
thought that man, which already controls far
too much in this world, could control truth.
The effects upon man since the advent of
this effrontery have most definitely caused
an age of chaos, call it Aquarius if you
please, and now on this crash course for

destruction, we are left to wonder why.

Yet, among all the many difficult ques-
tions twentieth century man is faced with
today, the answer to this question is simple:
Man does not control truth, period. As long
as man believes that he rriight control ulti-
mate reality, he will remain disillusioned. It
is much like a failing math student. The
poor failing math student will continue to
fail, causing whatever grief from parents
and school, in addition to not understanding
math, just as long as he insists upon his
answer being correct. The failing math stu-
dent does not create the correct answer; the
faltering society does not determine truth.
Something is not true ‘simple because it

Ultimately something which is true will
work because it is true, but merely because
something seems to work does it constitute
truth.

One is easily reminded of such truths by
Hitler. If man determines truth, morality, or
what have you, then Hitler was completely

. justified in his actions. Why? Because he

was true to himself when he murdered six
million people. Furthermore, the people of
the world, you and me, should praise Hitler,
not deride him, because he was more true to
himself than any human ever known to walk
on earth.

However, the only “truth” which Hitler
followed was that of destruction and Aquari-
us. As long as man insists on determining
his own truth and morality, man will pro-
ceed to destroy himself. As long as man

‘ maintains that he is the ultimate being in

the universe, he will continue to wage war
against perfection and pursue the persecution
of his own potential and of his soul.

When I look at society today and their
value of self above all else, I can’t help but
agree with the New Age.

Pro-choice: protecting women’s rights

MY VIEW

By Elizabeth Parkins
and Pamela Patton

“I think contraception is disgust-
ing — people using each other for
pleasure.” — Joseph Schneider, Di-
rector, Pro-Life Action League

I. Cameron Humphries’ extreme-
ly murky “My View,” with its lim-
ited comprehension of medical fact
(classifying the fetus as an organ,
and falsely clairriing that it struggles
against abortion), its suspension of
reality(mankind conquering death
and achieving immortality) and its
highly sophomoric tone, have no

place in an intelligent discussion of
the abortion issue. Dealing with the
matter in such a callous manner
does a great deal of disservice to

"women who must struggle with the

real problem of unwanted pregnan-
cy.

Furthermore, by comparing a
woman’s right to abortion to Hit-
ler’s “Final Solution,”Humphries is
confusing a woman’s freedom to
voluntarily choose an abortion with
a totalitarian state’s forced genocide.
Or is he ascribing to the fetus a
“will to live” comparable to that of
concentration-carnp victirris? We
must assume so, since he does as-
sert that the fetus struggles for life
against an abortion.

This notion is the featured mes-
sage of the right-to-life film “Silent

Scream,’ which was shown in Lex-
ington recently. It’s a romantic no-
tion, but it’s just not true. The New
York Times answered the film's
charges way back in March of 1985
by featuring five medical experts
who discounted the theory that a
l2—week—old fetus(91 percent of all
abortions are performed within the
first trimester) has sufficient nervous
system development for any degree
of consciousness, much less the
ability to sense danger and react to
It.

To equate the life of a fetus
with the lives of the victims of the
world wars (and, as Humphries so
precisely expresses it:“tlie war be-
fore that one and so on and so
on...") is an affront'to the worth,
valor and dignity of those who suf-

ices enjoyed getting a feel for the
weapon. Freshman Mike Sandridge’s
first round with the M-16 was suc-
cessful, and he said he couldn’t wait
to get another chance.

Meredith Gronroos summed up
her first experience by saying, “I
had always wanted to try something
like this. It was different than the
Schwarzenegger films I've seen, but
no less fun!”

The shooting exercise was a part
of the basic military science class,
according to Capt. Ramon L.
Ramos, of the W&L Military Sci-
ence department.

“It's a part of the class’ train-
ing," said Ramos. “We tried to
gear the event toward freshmen, but
all these shoots are open to all stu-
dents."

Ramos said there will be another
shoot during the winter term, which
will also be open to all interested
students.

From News Releases

Several Washington and Lee stu-
dents were given the chance to try
out America’s premier assault riﬂe,
the M—l6 machine gun, in a W&L
Military Science Department activity
last Tuesday.

The Open Shoot, which attracted
47 curious students, was held at the
Virginia Military Institute’s indoor
riﬂe range.

More than half of those who
participated said they had never be-
fore fired rifles. Each person was

Howevei, Associate Dean of Stu-
dents Anne Sch0rer—Larnont said,
“In the past, the students have
always led the discussions and Dr.
Worth and I‘only responded when
the student panel deferred to us.”

Without the presence of profes-
sional counselors, students might
refrain from asking more technical
questions, Schroer-Lamont contin-
ued. “This year's freshmen do not
know our faces and might be more
reluctant to seek us out if they need

By Tracey Thornblade
Staff Reporter

W&L history Prof. Lamar Cecil
will be signing copies of his latest
book, Wilhelm II: Prince and
Emperor, 1859-1900, in the
Boatwright Room of the University
Library tomorrow from 4:30 to 5:30
p.m.

Wilhelm II became the Kaiser of
the German Empire in 1888 and
twenty-six years later, led his
country into the first world war.

The book focuses on Wilhelm’s
youth, /including his Ang1o—Gerrnan
geneaology, his education, and his
service in the Prussian army, all of
which contributed to his future

, behavior and ideology.

It is the first comprehensive
biography of one of modem
history’s most powerful and

misunderstood rulers, and tells the
story of a, “bizarre and incapable
sovereign who never doubted that

 

Despite her fear that someone in
need might not seek out professional
counseling, Schroer-Lamont said the
dorm counselors are capable of
maintaining the program.

Refering to the exclusion of
administrators, McMurrow said the
date rape session “has been an
evolving process for the past four
‘years, and this is just another step,
hopefully an improvement.”

While the session was not man-
datory for freshmen, attendance was
quite high, McMorrow said. Ruscio
said dorm counselors showed an
interest in getting their freshmen to
attend, and that was probably more

he posessed both genius and divine
inspiration.”

Wilhelm II, Cecil's third book, is
the product of nearly twenty ‘years
of research. That research included
numerous trips to Europe to study

various letters and manuscripts

which pertained to Wilhelm’s life.
Cecil spent six months at

Windsor Castle in the Royal

Archives reading letters written by
Queen Victoria's eldest daughter,
who was Wilhelm’s mother. He also
used papers from the Danish Royal
Family and from the Hohenzollems,
the Royal Family of Prussia, to aid
in his research.

Cecil said he was prompted to
write the book for several reasons.
First, none of the popular
biographies of Wilhelm II told him
what he wanted to know. In
addition, the more he read about
Wilhelm, the more bizarre and
curious Cecil felt his personality
was, and the more interested he
became in studying his personality.

effective than his making it manda-
tory.

The dorm counselors, along with
Dean Schorer-Lamont, previewed
the video and felt that it presented

the ideas that they wanted to get
across to the freshmen, McMorrow
said.

“The video begins with a very
visual scene of the aquaintance rape,
but then becomes the story of what
happens to the victim and the agres-
sor after the event,” she said.

One freshman male who was
asked what the felt of the program
said, “It seemed that the video put
a guilt trip on the guys and the dis-

Ceil to sign copies of latest book

His research was most concerned
with investigating what parts of his
upbringing and lifework related to
the book. Finally, the time of
Wilhelm’s reign (1888-1918) is right
in the midst of Cecil's period of

specialty in the German Empire
(1871-1918.)

Wilhelm 1]: Prince and Emperor,
1859-1900, is the first of two
volumes. The end of this book
marks the ».half-way point in

Wilhelm’s life and also marks a

critical year in the history of the

German Empire.

Cecil said he
completed the
second volume.

“I am a great believer in the
value of biography,” Cecil said. “It
seems to me that Wilhelm H's role
in history is an important argument
for biography. For example, one
cannot understand Imperial Germany
without first understanding the men
who ruled her.”

has already
research for the

cussion was mainly geared towards
what the girl should do to avoid
date rape.”

Schorer-Lamont responded, “Un-
til we analyze the freshman evalua-
tions that were ﬁlled out, we will
not know how they all felt about
the program, but it is the case that
the male physiology ultimately
causes the rape, and there must be
some degree of discussion about
trlpw the female can try to prevent

1s.”

According to Schroer-Lamont,

students who have attended the pro-
gram have become much more sen-
sitive to the issue of date rape.

* The Washington and Lee
wt.7nen’s soccer team isn’t quite
ready to call it a season.

?Tuesday, the Generals upset Ro-

anoke College H) in overtime in

the? first round of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference tournament and

~ advanced to the semiﬁnals.

{In perhaps their most satisfying
game of the year, the Generals, who
had been plagued by an inability to
put‘ the ball in the net, overcame
their offensive shortcoming. Fresh-
1 an Andrea Cardamone scored the

1;; goal of the game during the

. overtime period, and the Gener-
scored a huge upset in a game
that everyone was sure they would
lose — everyone, apparently, but the
Getierals.

j“It was awesome,” said coach
Jan Hathom. “The team was ready,
and they went out to win. They had
great composure. [Sophomore] Ash-
ley Gray had her best game ever,
and! she turned it around for us.
From that point on, we were in the
ganle.

(‘We wanted it more. It was ob-
vious that we were the team that
warllted to win," she said. “It was
desire that won that game."

The Generals finished up their

orlie schedule Oct. 19 by defeating
arc -rival Hollins College 3-0. W&L
did not allow Hollins a single shot
on goal. .

The first score of the game came

abolit forty minutes into the first
alf‘, when senior Sarah Allen put
the ball into the net unassisted for
ei Generals. Sophomore Ann
hagighnessy put a second mark on
e scoreboard about fifteen minutes

Freshman Andrea Cardamone in action against
Randolph-Macon Woman's College earlier this
year. Cardamone scored the only goal in W&L’s

into the game. The final goal for
the Generals was scored by Card-
amone, off of a direct kick by soph-
omore Ashley Hurt, with about
twenty minutes remaining.

The victory was especially grati-
fying for the seniors, who have seen
some very tough losses to Hollins
in the past, and who, according to
Hathom, “all played well.” Hath-
om especially cited the play of
Hurt, classmate Katie Seeman, and

senior Catherine Baillio.

“We played great as a team,”
said Hathom. “It was an awesome,
wonderful game.”

Saturday the Generals traveled to
Wheeling, W.Va., to take on Wheel-
ing College, where they suffered a
4-0 loss. Junior goalie Sherri Brown
recorded eleven saves in a losing
effort.

W&L—BC: fast 1988 finish
not forgotten in 1989

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

Late fall is the time for the premier football rivalries.

Seldom do you see a game the caliber of a Notre Darne-USC or an
Oklahoma-Nebraska or an Alabama-Aubum or a USC-UCLA clash early
in the year. All these games are extremely physical and emotional with
the outcome usually decided on the final possession.

On Saturday, Washington and Lee and Bridgewater will tee the ball up
to renew what has developed into a first rate-rivalry.

Close, hard hitting games make for better rivalries, and last season’s
W&L-Bridgewater clash not only fit the rivalry bill, it fit the bill and
then some. Not only was the action on the ﬁeld highly contested and
intense, but the press box saw some heated moments, as did the locker
room after the game.

Bridgewater took a 10-7 lead with 1:21 left in the fourth quarter. W&L
then went on perhaps its most impressive drive of the season.

The drive started on the W&L 33 with 1:21 left, and quarterback
Phillip Sampson threw the Generals down the field in impressive fashion.
On the first play, Sampson hooked up with Craig Irons for 16 yards to
midfield. After three straight incompletions, Sampson and the Generals
were faced with a fourth and 10.

Sampson found a diving Chris Acebal for 12 yards to keep the drive
alive. A 23-yard strike to Carl Gilbert got the ball inside the Bridgewater
20, and another strike to Irons got the ball to the five. On first and goal,
W&L wasted no time. Sampson went to his favorite target, and Irons
came up with a diving catch in the end zone for a 14-10 W&L lead with
just 32 seconds left.

The game wasn't over. Head coach Gary Fallon recalled a game
against Randolph-Macon a few years ago when his team scored a go-
ahead touchdown with 32 seconds to go, and lost the game as R-MC
drove down the ﬁeld and scored with two seconds left to steal victory
from the jaws of defeat, so to speak.

With 32 seconds to go and W&L to kick off, Fallon's thoughts turned
to that Macon game. When Carter Quayle's kick bounced off an Eagle
return man and W&L recovered, Fallon let off a tremendous sigh. There
would be no miracle comeback this time.

The W&L comeback would not have been possible if not for the
timely play of linebacker Tom Skeen. Skeen came up with two
interceptions in the final period, one saving a touchdown in the end zone.

In the press box, the W&L radio crew of Jim Lake, Hayward Lee and
Mike Shady and Sports Information Director Mike Stachura were placed
next to the Bridgewater school president, who turned out to be an avid
and adamant Eagle supporter, often venting his emotion on the radio
crew. The Bridgewater SID was put in an almost helpless position, as he
could not tell his employer to “please tone it down a bit.” He
apologized later for the president, not on his behalf.

‘That brings us to football season 1989. W&L comes into the game
with a 4-3 record, Bridgewater is 34. But as in every other good rivalry,
throw the records out the window - they don’t apply for now.

Fallon has told his team that he expects a donnybrook. Bridgewater
certainly hasn't forgotten last year’s game, and any W&L football player
will tell you that last year’s win was the highlight of the season.

The major thing I feel will decide the game. It is Parents’ Weekend at
W&L. Under Fallon, the Generals are 8-3 on Parents’ Weekend.

Prediction: In another hotly contested, physical contest, the parents will

pull the Generals through. W&L by a touchdown in front of the home
folks, 21-14.

Men win ODAC title

 

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

The men’s soccer team won the
regular season Old Dominion Atlilet-
ic Conference championship yester-
day with a 2-0 victory over Ran-
dolph-Macon, only their second road
win of the season. The title was
W&L‘: second in the last five
years. The Generals won the corifer-
ence title in 1985.

W&L, 7-5-2 (4-1-1 in the
ODAC), will host the four-team
ODAC post-season tournament to-
morrow and Saturday. l-Iarnpden-
Sydney, Lynchburg and Virginia
Wesleyan also qualified for the tour-
narnent.

Yesterday's victory was the sec-
ond straight road win for the Gener-
als. On Saturday, W&L earned their
first road win of the season with a
3-2 win over Washington College,
after losing ﬁve away games and
tying one.

Saturday’s victory in Chester-
town, Maryland, pushed the Gener-
als’ record above the .500 mark for
the first time this season since the
5-3 win over Deriison in W&L’s
home opener.

More importantly, Saturday's
win proved to the Generals that they
can be successful on the road. Their
new-fourid success carried over into
yesterday's game in Ashland, Vir-
giriia.

Randolph-Macon, 6-8-3 (1-3-2 in
the ODAC), a former top-20 Divi-
sion II power, joined the ODAC
this season. The .Yellow Jackets
were coming off of an impressive
2-1 win over Mary Washington, the
top ranked team in the South. Mary
Washington tied W&L on Home-

coming Weekend.

Yesterday, the Generals’ goals
were scored by two freshmen. With
7:15 remaining in the first half,
Kyle Farming netted his first goal of
the season on an unassisted shot to
put W&L up 1-0. One ntinute lat-
er, Mike Hill scored an unassisted
goal to give the Generals a 2-0
lead, a margin that held for the rest
of the match.

Senior goalkeeper Jack Pringle
registered his first shutout of the
season (the 10th shutout of his ca-
reer), arid collected 10 saves. Ran-
dolph-Macon launched 20 shots at
the goal, while W&L had 19 shots.

On Saturday, Washington Col-
lege had a 2-0 lead in the second
half. Their first goal was sent past
Pringle after a breakaway down the
left side.

In the second half, the Shoremen
scored again when the W&L de-
fense delivered a weak pass back to
junior goalie Jon Bull. The ball was
intercepted and Washington College
scored on a two—on-one situation to
take a 2-0 lead and apparently ex-
tend W&L’s road woes.

The Generals started to make
their comeback from the two goal
deﬁcit when the Shoremen altered
their play in the middle of the field.

Give W&L’s midfield room to
play and they will make things hap-
pen. The Shoremen quickly learned
as they watched their lead slowly
melt away.

The Generals started on the
comeback trail when senior Rick
Silva was tripped in the penalty
box. Awarded a penalty shot, Silva
sent the free kick straight into the
middle of the net. The Shoremen’s
goalie had gone to the right side,

anticipating that Silva would again
aim for the right post.

With about 20 minutes left in the
match, the Washington College de-
fense gave W&L’s cause a huge
lift. Fanning was pressuring a
defcnseman, who tried to pass the
ball back to his keeper. The pass
missed the keeper and rolled into
the net with the keeper and senior
Scott Levitt in pursuit. The rarity is
known as an “own goal," and this
one tied the game at 2-2.

The Generals got the road mon-

key off their backs with six minutes‘

left. Freshman Mike Mitchem sent a
crossing pass from the left endline
to Levitt, who sent a left-footed vol-
ley into the back of the net. Levitt’s
goal proved to be the garne-winner
and snapped the Generals season-
long road woes.

In the first post-seasori ODAC
tournament, W&L will play host to
arch-rival Harnpden-Sydriey tomor-
row at 3 p.m. on Liberty Hall Field,
a.k.a. the Field of Doom. The Gen-
erals are unbeaten playing on the
Liberty Hall Field with a 5-0-1
mark, the lone non-win being the tie
with Mary Washington. W&L de-
feated H-SC earlier this season 2-0
on goals by senior Patrick Brown
and sophomore Chris Miyarnoto.

Lynchburg and Virginia Wesley-
an will play at 1:00 Friday after-
noon, before the W&L-H-SC clash.
Lynchburg handed W&L their only
conference loss during the year and
Virginia Wesleyan played the Gen-
erals to a tie.

The winners will meet on Satur-
day at 11:30 for the tournament
championship. The winner of the
tournament will receive an automatic
bid to the NCAA Division III tour-
nament.

Barineau regained the lead for
the Tigers on a tliree-yard run, but
Renrieker and the defense held firm
until Sampson could put the
Generals into the end zone late in
the game.

Said Fallon, “I thought we had
our best offensive line performance
of the year. They were really
getting after Sewanee‘s defensive

people. ’ '
The offensive line of juniors
Frank Sudell, Rob Christensen,

Mike DeMelfi, and Rob Roberton
and sophomores Jim Henry and
Robert Thomas opened the way for
Pope to gain over 100 yards for the
second tirrie this season and allowed
only one sack of Sampson.

Parents’ Weekend to play host to
conference rival Bridgewater.

The Generals received good news
on the injury front after the

last two games with a neck

The final game was a disastsr

for W&L. Arkansas is a team I

their superior skill level and strengili

However, Remillard was
convinced that the international style
of play allowed by the officiatirrg
crew contributed to the outlandish
final score. The physical style of
play punished the Generals, wh
rely on their superb team speed to
win games. ;

“It was the roughest game I've
been involved in the last threb
years," he said, adding that thg
tighter the game was called, the

His greatest concern after thh
tournament, though, was not
Arkansas. It was the letdown against
Richmond that weighed heavily oi.
his mind. “Tire next time we plan

that next time Richmond will by

‘Q’

spent the last few days utilizing our efficient

' library staff. They helped me pour over old

newspaper clippings, out-dated alumni magazines
and numerous books on ghosts. I consulted
books on Southern ghosts, Virginia ghosts, and
even Confederate ghosts. I talked with professors
who together represent over 100 years of Wash-
ington and Lee history. I even begged Captain
Peniston to reveal any tales of specters in the
basement of Lee Chapel. My search did not
divulge one Washington and Lee horror story. It
appears that we do not have a ghost on the
campus.

Yet my article is not a complete waste for I
can tell you about phantoms that are alleged to
haunt the surrounding city. Granted they are not
W & L ghosts, but these ghouls still might pro-
vide you with a little excitement come Hallow-
een. My information comes from the book The
Gentle Ghosts: Legends of the Historical Shenan-
doah Valley. The book was written by one-time
Lexington resident Anne McCorkle Knox.

Let us first turn our attention to the cadets of
the Virginia Military Institute. Washington and
Lee is older than V.M.I, but those lucky guys

Knox writes that a few cadets declare that
they have heard mysterious noises in Jackson
Memorial Hall. The Hall contains a large mural
of the Battle of New Market. One night a cadet
fell asleep in the Hall, and he was accidentally
locked in the building. The cadet claims that the
mural came to life — its ﬁgures began to move
and the sounds of battle echoed in Jackson Me-
morial Hall. The story is still well—known to
cadets.

Finally, Knox informs her readers that some
say that the ghost of William M. Simpson, class
of 1924, can be spotted on the V.M.I. parade
grounds. Simpson was a sculptor, and there is a
monument on the parade grounds that bears his
art work. Knox writes that when darkness falls
over the grounds, people claim that the ghost of
Simpson is seen lingering near his artwork.

But the Virginia Military Institute doesn‘t
have a monopoly on Lexington ghosts. Knox’s
book also spins tales of spirits that prowl the
streets of _Lexington. She tells the story of a
Washington and Lee student that once lived in
an apartment behind the modem—day Rockbridge
County Court House. The student was an adopt

stands the Reid-White house. Knox writes that
the former head of the Washington and Lee
University library, Henry Coleman, claimed to
hear a ghost and witness its destruction. While
staying alone in the house one night,‘ Coleman
heard footsteps descending from the house’s attic
to the basement storage room. After several
metal objects were knocked over, Coleman says
he then heard the footsteps climb to the master
bedroom on the second floor. Coleman heard a
loud crash, followed by the footsteps once again
mounting the attic stairs. The final sound was
the slamming of the attic door. The next mom-
ing Coleman discovered that a painting in the
bedroom lay smashed on the floor. Knox writes
that if an intruder had climbed back into the
attic, he would have then found himself trapped;
there was no way to exit the attic “without
wings.” In later years children claimed to hear
footsteps in the Reid-VW1ite house. Are you still
going to mail letters late at night?

Perhaps the most famous Lexington ghost is
Phil Nurin. “The Castle” is on Randolph Street.

‘White water mecca’

“lt gets me down sometimes,"
says the biology major, “but I
wouldn't trade it for the world.”I n

The Ring-tum Phi, October 26, 1989

   

BY Wendy W°'f°rd West Virginia is the
Staff Repm" mecca of the white
water world. That's
why about 31,000
people have rafted
it in the past six
weeks. I

— Mark Lubkowitz

guide must have three months train-
ing in river rescue, CPR and ad-
vanced life saving. But next to prac-
tical training, a sense of humor is
crucial, he adds.

“You’re dealing with people
who are in a totally foreign environ-
ment,” Lubkowitz notes. "When
they take a fall, you’ve got to bring
them out of the water with a joke
'to get rid of their fear."

Despite an occasional spill, Lub-
kowitz assures his customers that
rafting is not a suicide sport. In
working for a commercial outﬁtter,
safety comes first, he adds.

Not only is his weekend activity
much different from the W&L norm
but his study habits as well. _The
strain of two all day trips on the
river is nothing compared to the
effort of maintaining grades.

For six weeks this fall, W&L
junior Mark Lubkowitz led a double
life. When the weekend arrived, he
left the ivory towers of Lexington
to brave the rolling rapids of West
Virginia’s Gauley River.

A part-time raft guide for Class
VI River Runners, Lubkowitz
worked from 5:30 a.m. until dusk
every Saturday and Sunday leading
rafters down a 28-rnile stretch of
river.With its six to eight foot
waves and Class V and VI rapids
(six being the most difficult on a
scale of one to six), the Gauley
River has enticed the junior as a
guide for the past three years.

“West Virginia is the mecca of
the white water world,” says Lub-
kowitz, “and the Gauley is one of
the toughest rivers in the East.” In
fact, many of his fellow guides
were drawn to the Gauley from as
far as California, Australia and Ire-
land.

“It’s intense white water,” the
junior says, “that’s why about
31,000 people rafted on it in the
past six weeks.”

Besides a lust for adventure,
Lubkowitz explains that a river

son, Lubkowitz rerr.-embers t._ving to
study in West Virginia. "I used to
hang a ﬂashlight from the top of
my tent to study,” he explains,
“but every time I moved so did the
light so I gave it up.”

To solve his dilemma, Lub-
kowitz cracked open his books on
Friday afternoons before making the
trip to West Virginia. Although
Monday tests were sometimes a
problem, he believes the experience_
he gained as a guide was worth the
extra effort.

Even during the week, Lub-
kowitz keeps in close contact with
water sports. As part of the outing
club activities, the junior teaches
kayaking classes twice a week
bringing his average time on the
river to 50 hours a week.

Now that Gauley season has
ended, Lubkowitz will focus his at-
tentions on the winter kayaking sea-
son. This weekend he will take stu-
dents to the James River to hone
their kayaking skills.

“I don't know if I'll get many
(kayaking) students on the James in
January,” Lubkowitz laughs, “but
I'll be out there.”

left. Knox writes that Phil Nunn
was a towering black man who
lived in Lexington around the turn
of the century. Everyone knew of
Nunn’s legendary strength, but also
knew of his gentle kindness and
southern manners. He was the pro-
verbial “gentle giant.” Nunn per-
formed odd jobs around Lexington.
Knox writes that one winter Nunn’s
toes were badly frozen, and his
huge feet could no longer fit into
shoes. He was forced to fashion
shoes out of planks, and Nunn tied
the boards to his ankles with rags.
The banging of his wooden shoes
always told Lexington residents that
Phil Nurtn was approaching. Nunn
was a honest man, and he didn’t
trust the banks. Legend says that
instead Nunn hid his money in the
walls and under the floorboards of
“The Castle.” When the rats ate
the dollars that Nunn shoved into
the walls, Knox says that Nunn took
to carrying around a burlap bag
ﬁlled with his life savings. Nurm is
now dead, but some claim that at
night, when the moon is shining
bright, that they can see the shadow
of Nunn in the upstairs windows.
Others think they have heard the
clop of Nuxm’s shoes as he paces
around the apartment

Another myth? I spoke with
Washington and Lee junior Scott

Bell, who lives in “The Castle"
with Kappa Sigma fraternity brother
Mike DeMelf1. Bell has not heard
any mysterious footsteps around the
apartment, but says that another fra-
temity brother, who lived in “The
Castle,” once heard someone walk-
ing around the apartment.

Franklin Daniels, another Wash-
ington and Lee junior, supports the
story. Daniels was at “The Castle”
one night when the same fraternity
brother said he felt a presence in
the house.

“Just as he said that,” says
Daniels, “I felt something brush up
against me and continue down the
hall. I turned around and couldn't
see anything.”

Daniels added that the occupants
of the apartment were drinking that
night. Alcohol or ghosts? That is up
for you to decide. When Scott Bell,
the current tenant of “The Castle,”
was asked if the Phil Nunn story
bothered him, he laughed and said
“No, I think it is kind of fun to
live in a place with such a reputa-
tion.” Neither Bell nor his room-
mate have found any of the legend-
ary Nunn treasure.

Finally, on Jefferson Street there
stands the Vanderslice-Roberson
house. It is the ancient residence
across the street from Spanky’s.
Knox writes that the house is nick-
named the “House of Four
Ghosts,” and the dwelling dates

back to 1790. Many famous ameri-
cans have visited the Vanderslice-

Knox states that four ghosts are
allegedly suppose to haunt the old
dwelling. At nightfall, a young girl
can be seen in one of the upstairs
windows of the house. She stands in
the window and simply combs her
hair. The second ghost is never
seen. Instead, on lonely nights one
might hear him knocking four times
on the front door. The third ghost,
according to Knox, is a gray appari-

seen either coming down the stairs
or standing in the kitchen doorway.
The fourth ghost is actually two -
these are the spirits of two slaves
who pledged to always protect the

was murdered near the Lime Kiln

from page 1

Raleigh-Durham area to conduct a
feasibility study by February for the
plan.

According to Hotchkiss, the firm
will interview a small but
representative cross-section of the
alumni body to determine
the willingness of alumni to work
on the Long Range Plan and the
amount of financial support they are
willing to offer.

Hotchkiss said that in general
the board found every item of the
Long Range Plan worthwhile, but
the trustees “have to focus on
certain issues that seem to be the
most important... [and] apply a good
deal of realism.” The results of the
feasibility study will allow board
members to prioritize their agenda
of items for approval.

Willard Dumas had
opportunity of meeting the board
for the first time in the role of
Executive Committee president. He

the

gave a report on the state of the
honor system and showed the board
that

the new video on honor

freshmen saw during orientation.

The board asked “a lot of
questions” about the ﬁnancial state
of the Student Activities Board, said
Dumas. “The general consensus
was that they were very pleased that
the EC had the situation under
control and [had created] the new
position of auditor.”

Dumas also attended the board
meetings on the Long Range Plan
concerning undergraduates and
campus life. Among other subjects,
he expressed support for the
proposed student center. He said he
also told the board he was
“somewhat concerned” that the
plan did not sufficiently address the
needs of independent students.

IU President John Vittori agreed
with Dumas, but said, “In order for
them to give us more attention, we

have to show them that we exist.
People don’t know what the
Independent Union does. "

Vittori said that the IU has been
less active in past years, but
because it has received a much
larger budget this year, it will strive
to change that trend with more
meetings and more activities. Low
student participation in IU events
will “definitely turn around,” he
said.

TO CHANGE
    THE
WORLD

Circle these dates on your calender:
Thursday, October 26 and Friday, October 27.

Not everyone is cut out to change
the world. After all, it takes educa-
tion, skills and a spare two years.

Also a willingness to work. Hard.

This year 3,750 Americans will join
the Peace Corps to do just that.
They'll do things like build roads, .
plant forests and crops, teach
English, develop small businesses,

train community health workers, ,
or even coach basketball. However,
what they'll be doing isn't half as
important as the fact that they'll be
changing a little piece of the world
'. . .for the better.

And when they return, these
3,750 Americans will find that
experience doing hard work will
have another benefit. It's-exactly
what their next employers are
looking for.

Solgive the Peace Corps your next
two years. And while you're out
changing the world, you'll also be
making a place in it for yourself.

Peace Corps recruiters will be at the University
Center in room 109 from 7 pm until 9 pm to show arfilm
about Peace Corps on Oct. 26.

Sign up for interviews at the Placement Office.
Interviews will be held from 8:45 am until 4:45 pm on

Panhel
plans for
housing

By Courtney Payne
Staff Reporter

The women in Washington and
Lee's sororities want houses compa-
rable to renovated fraternity houses,
according to the results of a Parihel-
lenic housing needs survey.

Wendy Wilson, Panhellenic
Housing and Extension Committee
Chairwoman, said she met last
Wednesday to share the survey re-
sultsiwith Associate Dean of Stu-
dents Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins,
Assistant to the President Frank Par-
sons and Dean of Housing Ken
Ruscio.

Of the 112 women surveyed,
95 percent said they_ would like so-
rority houses that would provide
living and meal facilities as well as
meeting space.

The second most popular idea,
listed on the survey as an immediate
need, was for permanent meeting
facilities. The third choice was for
lodges, which would be used for
storage and meetings but not living.

Wilson said the list was divided
into three sets of needs: immediate,
interim and long term. It included
all suggestions put forth to the com-
mittee from the three sorority chap-
ters on campus, she said.

)

“We're not sending a proposal
to the university right now, we’re
sending the things we need,” said
Wilson. “It's a first step so that
Panhellenic and the university can

1 cooperatively deﬁne the housing
possibilities for women’s frater-
. nities."

“We’re waiting on the university
right now. We’re in a holding pat-
tern until they come back to us,”
said Wilson.

The next meeting between the
administration and the Extension

‘ ' Committee has not been set.

places to be shared between the all

Beard: weekend
was ‘pretty good’

By Brian Root
Senior Copy Editor

Although the Lexington police
issued two noise violations and nu-
merous noise warnings to many of
Washington and Lee’s 16 fraterni-
ties, Police Chief Bruce Beard was
pleased with students’ conduct dur-
ing Halloween parties this weekend.

“I feel pretty good about the
weekend," ,Beard said. “I was glad
to see it, since it was also W&L’s
Parents’ Weekend." '

Beard said the two houses which
received noise violations were Sig-
ma Chi and Pi Kappa Phi. Because
they received noise violations, both
houses will not be issued noise per-
mits for one week.

Both fraternities were also given
one week of social probation by the
Iriterfratemity Council.

Main library
to close
on Sunday

From Staff Reports

The University Library will
be closed from 7 a.m. Sunday to
7 a.m. Monday for electrical
maintenance.

According to Buildings and
Grounds Superintendent Jim Ar-
thur, power to the library must
be turned off Sunday so that
_crews can work on the build-
ing’s transformer.

“We have tried to schedule
this to cause as few problems as
possible,” Arthur said.

University Librarian Barbara
Brown encouraged students to
use the library on Saturday
instead.

According to Beard, only two
people were arrested for underage
possession of alcohol this weekend.

“I think the new law [under
which a person convicted of under-
age possession can, under extreme
circumstances, temporarily lose his
driver's license] is making people
think twice about being out on the
street with beer,” Beard said.

At Tuesday night's IFC meeting,
IFC President Kevin Nash warned
the fraternities about controlling
noise at parties, as well as the regu-
lation requiring fraternities to regis-
ter all parties with the Dean of Stu-
dents office, even those held in the
country.

“You can’t forget to register
your Wednesday night parties,” said
Nash. “You can’t just blow it off.”

Nash also again reminded the
fraternities that all mandatory pledge
activities are prohibited until the

Job fair draws 600

By Jason Kelley
Staff Reporter

Over 600 students from nine
area colleges participated in
“Challenge," a career fair held last
Friday in the Student Activities Pa-
vilion and sponsored by the W&L
Career Development and Placement
office.

There were 126 recruiters repre-
senting 63 companies on hand to
meet with the seniors, give out in-
formation about their companies and
conduct pre-selection interviews.

This was the seventh annual ca-
reer fair organized by a consortium
of schools including Hampden-Syd-
ney, Hollins, Longwood, Lynchburg,
Mary Baldwin, Raldolph-Macon
Woman’s College, Sweet Briar, Vir-
ginia Military Institute, as well as
W&L.

In past years, the fair had been
held at the Raddison hotel in
Lynchburg, but W&L agreed to host
the event this year.

According to W&L Recruitment
Coordinator Penny Henneman, the
purpose of Challenge was to provide
a forum for seniors to get informa-
tion about companies in which they
are interested.

The fair was very successful,
according to Henneman, and will
most likely be held again, next year.

Following the morning session,
which included several workshops,
each company conducted interviews
with students whose resumes had
been reviewed.

“There was a very good range
of companies represented, from the
highly technical ones to the more
general types of companies, and
they were all interested in liberal
arts students,” said Henneman.

More tickets
on the way

Lex hires additional officer;
enforcement begins Dec. 1

By Joel Smith
Staff Reporter

When Washington and Lee stu-
dents return to school in January
following Christmas break, they will
find stricter enforcement of parking
laws in downtown Lexington, Mayor
H.E. “Buddy" Derrick said Tues-
day.

Derrick said the city has hired
an additional policeman who will
devote half of his time enforcing
parking laws and the other half
serving as Lexington’s animal con-
trol officer.

The stricter enforcement of the
two—hour parking limit downtown
will actually begin Dec. 1, but the
city will issue courtesy Christmas
citations instead of actual tickets in
order to ease into the new approach.

Beginning Jan. 1, however, vio-
lators will have to pay the usual
$10 fine, Derrick said.

Construction of the Wal-Mart sh-
opping center beside Rt. 11 North
and the upcoming construction of a
larger K-Mart store at the other end

of town created a need to open up
downtown parking spaces, the may-
or said.

According to Derrick, stricter,
more regular parking enforcement
will increase the availability of
two-hour parking spaces downtown
and help downtown merchants com-
pete against the two retail stores.

“The city is concerned that the
downtown area continue to be a vi-
brant area for business and the ser-
vice industries, and a major compo-
nent of that is viable parking,” Der-

rick said. “We want to have conve-
nient parking for our downtown
shoppers.

“Due to a shortage of man-
power, we had been enforcing it on
a hit-or-miss basis, but with the iri-
creased competition of the two sh-
opping centers we feel the urgency
for having convenient parking'down—
town,” he said.

The increased parking enforce-
ment will affect not only W&L stu-
dents but also shoppers, store own-
ers and others who work downtown,

Peppers’ condition
‘much improved’

By Lee Fleming
Staff Reporter

The condition of Washington and
Lee Commerce School Dean Larry
Peppers is “much improved"
following a heart attack Thursday,
according to Pepper's secretary.

“The word we’ve gotten is that
he’s_ been steadily improving over
the last wee ,” saids Anne Zeigler,
who added that Peppers is expected
home “probably this weekend.”

Following his heart attack, Pep-
pers was admitted to Lexington’s
Stonewall Jackson Hospital. He was
transferred to Roanoke’s Memorial

Hospital Friday.

According to‘ university Vice
President John Elrod, Peppers
should be able to return to teaching
“fairly soon.”

“We have every reason to be-
lieve that he will make a complete
recovery, and that he will be able to
return to all the activities he was
engaged in before the heart attack,”
Elrod said.

Peppers came to W&L in 1986
from Creighton University in Oma-
ha, Nebraska. He recieved his doc-
torate degree from Vanderbilt Urii—
versity.

Peppers’ son, Todd, is a W&L
senior.

Phi to list check bouncers

 

By Melinda Conkling
Staff Reporter

Students who have failed to ap-
pear before the Student Financial
Relations Committee to answer
questions about bounced checks will
now see their names advertised in
The Ring-tum Phi.

The Executive Committee decid-
ed to take that step after hearing
from James Rambeau, Chairman of
the SFRC, at Monday's EC meeting.
Rambeau said that there are present-

ly seven students with outstanding
debts and that it has been difficult

getting students to appear at SFRC
meetings.

In the past, the SFRC secretary
has called students with debts and
then mailed letters telling them
when to appear before the SFRC,
Rambeau said.

Rambeau suggested that if the
students do not appear after getting

seniors

Scott Jackson, a W&L senior
who attended Challenge said, “It
was better than other career fairs
I've been to because there was an
opportunity for interviews in the
afternoon. There were a lot of com-

panies that do not do regular
recruiting at W&L represented
there. ’ ’

Jackson's only complaint was that
the bulk of the companies that at-
tended seemed to be commercial
banks.

“There needs to be a wider range
of firms to interview other majors.
It seemed to be mostly for C-School
majors,” he said.

Also, according to Henneman,

the students looked very impressive.

“They were all dressed as they
should have been for job interviews
and, on the whole, looked very pro-
fessional,” she said.

a letter then the following week
their names should appear in the
Phi. The EC voted unanimously to
institute this procedure.

“We’re not trying to penalize
students,” said EC President Willard
Dumas. “We just want them to re-
pay their debts to the student
body.” The SFRC pays the amount
of any student check returned to a
local merchant for insufficient funds.

‘In other business, Dumas pres-
ented two proposals which would
give W&L students a fall break.

The first would give students a
week off halfway through Fall Term
but only Thanksgiving Day off in
November.

The second proposal would give
students Monday and Friday off at
the six-week mark. At Thanks-
giving, students would have
Wednesday through Friday off but
would have classes on Saturday,

The EC voted to hold a referen-
dum to gauge student interest

Also, the EC sub-comrnittee re-
sponsible for proposing penalties for
unauthorized charges’ by student or-
ganizations made its report. The EC
decided any student who makes un-
authorized charges will be person-
ally liable for what he spends and
will also be fired.

“Once we make people person-
ally liable, they will think twice
about charging,” Dumas said.

The EC eliminated the charging
privileges of the Student Activities
Board earlier this year, after the
SAB spent $23,000 over its budget
last year. Virtually all of those over-
runs went toward the 1989 Fancy
Dress Ball.

At present, a no-charging rule
applies only to the SAB, but a sub-

committee of the EC is exploring
the possibility of applying that ban
to all EC-funded organizations.

The EC also heard budget
reports from The Calyx, Contact and

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phl, November 2, 1989

Wilson studies
the Self—Study

It’s getting so a newspaper can’t ﬁnd anything to rant
about nowadays. Just when we were getting a mild furor
started, the Washington and Lee Board of Trustees and
President John Wilson have to go and do something
right.

Last week in this column, we complained about
something called the Washington and Lee University
Long Range Plan, also known as the Self-Study. We
called this 440-page document a “monstrosity.” We said
it was “devoid of fiscal realism and student input.” We
blasted its calls for tying tuition to the costs of other
schools and questioned the study’s motives.

Now, we ﬁnd out that Wilson and W&L’s trustees
have gone and eliminated the reasons for much of our
concern. Although the board has yet to take ofﬁcial
action, Wilson tells us that he and the board’s Executive
Committee have already pegged some of the study’s
recommendations as too expensive, unnecessary or just
plain wrong.

Speciﬁcally, according to Wilson, the study’s idea of
basing W&L’s tuition on the rates charged by “compara-
ble” institutions is all but doomed. The president on
Monday predicted that the present means of setting
tuition, which is based on the cost of running W&L and
has nothing to do with other schools, will be preserved.
We applaud the president for taking that position.

The study also suggested W&L should work to admit
equal numbers of men and women. Here again, the
trustees and the president said no. While nothing is set
in stone, a letter from Wilson to the board’s EC and
another letter from the board’s EC to the rest of the
trustees indicate that, over the next ten years, W&L will
strive for a student body of 1,600, with 1,000 men and
600 women. The board’s EC seems here to have found
an appropriate balance between what it called an
“erosion of alumni support” that would result from “a
perception that we have departed substantially from our
heritage” and the need for W&L to avoid being simply
a men’s college that admits women.

The EC’s letter also urged caution on another point -
plans for a new student center. 'l‘he trustees acknowl-
edged the need for a new Co-op and Bookstore, and they
joined the president and the authors of the Self-Study in
calling for a new building in which fraternity and
sorority members, independent students and faculty
members may gather. But the trustees seem well aware
that building another Fairfax Lounge or Arlington
Women’s Center would be a ridiculous waste of money.
Even though the Self-Study’s authors, the president and

the trustees agree that a new student center is i’m"por‘tan"t, ’ '

the EC’s letter makes a point of urging “careful further
study of the particular functions and spaces intended for
the new building to insure that our intentions will be
fully realized.” Translation: one Fairfax is more than
enough; let’s not build another.

We were pleased that the trustees raised an important
issue the study did not: the need of W&L’s sororities for
meeting and social space. The sororities have indicated
an interest in building lodges or houses, and the
university should be supportive of that effort. And the
reduced need for on-campus facilities that would result
from their construction should be considered in planning
a new student center. Furthermore, in all areas of student
life, the fact that sororities may make some proposed or
existing university services redundant should heavily
inﬂuence plans for the rest of this century.

'Clearly the board and the president are on the right
track. We still question some aspects of the study that
the board’s EC did not — for example, we doubt W&L
really needs a full-time chaplain, we question whether
“class unity” is as lacking and as crucial as the study’s
authors and the president indicate, and we have serious
problems with spending tuition dollars for residence life
programs that most W&L students neither want nor need.
But, in general, we believe Wilson and the board’s EC
have properly balanced faculty idealism and leadership
with a sense of ﬁscal responsibility and a recognition of
student competence and independence. We like the
sifting we have seen so far; we are optimistic that it will
continue.

‘Super 301’ will be a super mistake}

MY VIEW
By Tina Vandersteel

The United States may soon .«

suffer from Congress‘ newest venmre
into protectionism known as “Super
301," a measure provided for under
the Omnibus Trade and
Competitiveness Act. Earlier this
year, under the "Super 301"
premise, the United States targeted
Japan, Brazil and India as “unfair
traders" that could be subject to
tough retaliation if trade negotiations
do not prove satisfactory in reducing
these countries’ barriers.

If the United States does resort to
protectionist measures, the other
countries will surely respond with
their own retaliation against US.
exports, thereby destroying American
jobs and risking a U.S. recession.

Retaliation has proved costly in
the past. For example, when the
United States set tariffs on Canadian
cedar in 1986, Canada responded
with restrictions on American
computers and grains. When the
United States placed resnictions on
$50 million worth of Chinese textiles

in 1983, China cancelled American
wheat contracts worth $699 million.
In these two cases, the
shortsightedness of U.S. cedar and
textile exporters destroyed American
jobs in other innocent industries.

In addition to destroying jobs,
protectionism forces consumers to
pay higher prices. According to
Georgetown University economist
Gary Hufbauer, in 1986 trade barriers
cost Americans $65 billion, or an
average of $1,080 for every family
of four. More speciﬁcally, Brookings
Institute economist Robert Crandall

lock American workers into positions
that will only exist as long as
politicians in Washington want to
protect them. '

Why then, does protectionism
remain a popular choice in
Washington? Many U.S. industries
have found foreign companies to be
stiff competition. So, these industries
have decided to compete politically
rather than economically. They have
spent huge amounts of money on
lobbying in Washington in the hope
of shielding themselves from foreign

. competition.
estimates that Japanese “voluntary" Many of these industries have
“P011 Yestmims 0'1 m°t0T Vehicles undergone difficult adjustments

added an average of about $2,500 to
the price of 1987 Japanese vehicles
and about $750 to American models.

Some critics of free trade argue
that protectionism saves jobs in the
industries it protects by sheltering the
industries from foreign competition.
But, jobs saved by protection don't
always equal other jobs lost.
Recently, proposed textile legislation
was promoted as saving 46,700
textile industry jobs, but it was later
revealed that the legislation cost
52,400 jobs in the retail industry.
That's a net loss of 7,700. In such
cases, the jobs that are saved simply

during the past years, and many of
them still have more adjustments to
make. But during the 1980s
recession, America as a whole chose
not to travel the route of economic
isolationism paved with protectionist
legislation. In the true American
spirit, we met this challenge through
the often difficult task of
restructuring, retooling and rebuilding
American industry.

One example close to home is the
automobile industry. Although the
rebuilding is not over, the industry
has already made encouraging gains.
Ford's sales went up 16 percent from

1987 to 1988, and General Motor’s,
and Chrysler's went up 8.3 percent
and 21.2 percent, respectively. Herel
increased international competitio
has stimulated improvements and
innovation in production processesr
and industry structure. If the
government had interfered, it may‘
have condemned the Big Three to lag;
behind foreign
indeﬁnitly.

If Washington wants to build a,
stronger America, it should move to
eliminate protection already in place)’
For example, the U.S.-Canada Free
Trade Agreement promises to be a
boon to both countries. They
agreement is expected to increase
U.S. GNP by $45 billion and’
Canada's GNP by as much as $15,
billion.

The U.S.—Canada Free Trade‘
Agreement is a good example of the;
kind of “get tough" trade policy the
United States should pursue. Instead!
of leveling the playing ﬁeld by ‘
copying other countries’ unwise
protection, we should negotiate with?
other countries to reduce their),
harmful barriers. This is the kind of
policy that won't cost American jobs;
or hurt consumers and will build a ,
strong America.

PHA explains
housing status

In response to last week’s editorial, I
believe- it is necessary to clarify the
Washington and Lee Panhelleriic Association's
current status in regards to housing. An excerpt
from Chairman Wendy Wilson's Panhellenic
Housing Committee Report of Oct. 17 follows:

The Panhellenic Housing Committee met on
several occasions this year to assess the current
housing/meeting room situation. The committee
evaluated the present circumstances and
established a two-part goal. The first part of
the goal dealt with deﬁning future housing
plans for the association based on what ideas
and desires the Greek women expressed. In
addition, a cooperative list of all the known
present meeting space options was planned so
that the resources could be compiled and
shared throughout the association.

The chairman has also met informally with
Dean Leroy Atkins, Mr. Frank Parsons, and
Dean Ken Ruscio to discuss suggestionsittfri
the university. A survey was also sent to each
Greek woman, asking her to rank a list of
needs, not options, according to their
importance to her. The results of this survey
were compiled and presented to Parihellenic
Council on Oct. 17, and to university ofﬁcials
on Oct, 18. Currently the committee is waiting
for questions and ideas from the university.

To date these are the only steps that have
been taken. I say this not to discount their
importance, but to note the misleading nature
of the editorial which states: “sororities, the
prime users of Fairfax Lounge, seem well on
their way to building lodges of their
own...[and] that the use of these places
[Arlington Women's Center, Fairfax Lounge,
and any additional spaces to be built] will end
as soon as lodges go up.” The editorial then
concludes that “we would be hard—pressed to
ﬁnd two more under-used facilities on campus;
now the study says we need a third." The
reasoning is faulty primarily because of the
assumption that lodges will go up. The
Association is examining all housing options,
and lodges are only one option. Also there are
other university organizations that rely heavily
on the existing facilities for meeting space and
perhaps could beneﬁt from additional space.
That, however, is not the issue I am
addressing.

Until more information has been gathered
from the Greek women and the university, no

 

LETTERS

deﬁnitive statement or assumption can or
should be made in -temis of housing.
Unfortunately when a statement is printed that
implies that lodges are likely to be built, a
conclusion has been drawn prematurely, and
the idea is planted in the reader's mind as
being fact or work under progress. I must also
add that a reporter from the Phi meets with
either the Publicity Chairman or myself on a
weekly basis. Correct information and the
status of any committee work is available at
this time. Thank you for your attention to this
matter, and I would appreciate you making this
clariﬁcation available to the readers of the Phi.

Sincerely,

Buy bleachers
for away fans

Whatever happened to the time when a
football team and its fans would take up one
side of the ﬁeld, while its opponents and fans
would occupy the other? It was always that
way in high school, and it is always that way
when our football team travels to away games.
Unfortunately, that's not the way it is here at
W&L.

We desperately need to install bleachers for
fans on the visitor's side of the ﬁeld. I've
watched our opponents’ supporters for four
years come in and take over the ﬁfty yard line
at every home game. It is incredibly
disheartening as a player to hear, what sounds
like, the entire stadium erupt into cheering
when our opponents score. At home games, I
want to hear people cheering for W&L! That's
the whole point of the “home ﬁeld
advantage.” Last year, we even had to deal
with the Randolph-Macon College cheerleaders
right behind our bench doing cheers throughout
the game.

It is ridiculous that a school as well off as
Washington and Lee carmot supply a small set
of bleachers for the visiting team’s supporters.
Every other school that I've ever seen has such
stands, and I can't ﬁnd any logical reason why
we don't. I hope that our new athletic director,
Mr. Michael Walsh, noticed this problem at
Saturday's game. I also hope he will consider
doing something about it.

Sincerely,
Chris Smytlie, '90

achieve victory, and that included the on—sides

He was so conﬁdent, in fact, that he was t,

“My fellow Atheists, it is my
great pleasure to address you as the
third century of Atheism draws to a
close. As we approach this anniver-
sary of intellectual freedom, I be-
lieve that it is important we under-
stand our tradition before we enter
the next era of our belief.

Never let us forget, we are still
pioneers; our movement is still
young. Man has believed in God for
thousands of years. Only the last
few generations have been able to
question, erode, and destroy his be-
lief in Him. In the annuls of histo-
ry, we are still young and a minor-
ity. Our continued success requires
that we remember this.

However, this should not
discourage us. From the writings of
only a handful of skeptics, we have
grown into one of the largest move-
ments in the world today. World
leaders, governments, cultures, soci-
eties, and individuals have come to
accept our belief. Our children can
proudly say that their ancestors nev-
er used inquisitors, torture chambers,
or armies to spread their belief. No,
ours is an intellectual revolution.

As we all know, the route to
change people's minds is to change
the way they speak. No other move-

The Ring-tum Phi, November 2, 1989

Atheism: our new religion?

the way we have redefined key
temts within the language. Perhaps
most important of these words is
the word religion. Pardon me, but
this has become our society’s black
word. It has been removed from our
children’s textbooks, it is now taboo
in intellectual conversation, and to
be considered religious is not only
an insult, it carries with it the im-
plication that one is fanatical. My
friends, allow me to repeat. When
you penetrate a culture’s language,
you alter the manner in which they
think. Here lies the beginning of our
success.

Definitions of words like God,
faith, heaven, hell, Christian, evil,
good, true, right have been all
re-written through our hard work. I
hate to dwell on a point, but I be-
lieve that our re-definition of two of
these words had been so crucial to
our success, that I must expound on
them.

The first of these two words is
heaven. We have integrated the
word heaven into our own worldly
vocabulary so well that we today
use it interchangeably with earthly
words like perfect or fantastic.
Sometime in the last three hundred
years, our culture has confused ulti-
mate divinity with something pleas-
ing here on earth. Today, we have
expressions like ‘Oh, the beach was
heavenly,’ or ‘God, her body is
heaven.’ Unlike our forefathers who
painted, sculpted, and conceived
spiritual perfection
which was removed from this earth,
today we perceive heaven as a
physical or secular perfection. In
other words, through language, we
have taken heaven away from God,
and placed it among mortal here on
earth. Why would anyone need God
if they can have heaven here on
earth?

Perhaps even more important
than our success with the word
heaven has been with the word
faith. Two thousand years ago, the
word faith was one of the big three,
right along with hope and love. To-
day, it is a dirty word. It suggests
that one’s brain is weak; that a per-
son is so incapable of finding his

‘own answers, he must trust someone

else’s. A young child has faith; you
and I have knowledge. And where

can man lind knowledge: In God?
In the Bible? In faith? No, the only
sources of knowledge our society
accepts 1S science.

Through language, then, we have
made it easier for man to not to
believe, than for man to believe.
This was the first half of our victo-
ry. The second was to destroy reli-
gion from the inside out.

Man today will go to church, but
he still feels that he should be able
to pick and choose his morality.
This moral grab bag mentality, fills
the "religious freak" with pride
when he successfully lives by one
or two of his chosen morals. How-
ever, you and I know better. When
society begins to destroy certain val-
ues of their moral code, they really
destroy the entire moral code. One
does not destroy the code which
states that two plus is two without

undermining the validity of one plus
one and three plus three. We have
nearly reached the point, my friends,
where a man can scarcely say that
any morality is anything better than
‘true for himself.’

Furthermore, as man has become
more and more religiously hollow
over the past three hundred years,
he has become less and less secure
that his watered down faith and mo-
rality was even at all correct. His
self confidence declined and he be-
came more inclined to accept the
other moral values which
contradicted the previous
generation’s values. Three hundred
years ago freedom of religious
thought was a laughable subject
among kings, parliaments, and even
religious leaders. They were all so
confident that their faith was the
true faith, they could impose it on
others with little feelings of insecu-
rity. Today, we enjoy not only a
freedom of religious thought, but a

freedom from religious thought. The »

religious backbone of our world has
been broken so extensively that
even religious leaders are loathe to
say that theirs is anything more than
possibly a correct answer.

My fellow Atheists, we have not
yet far to go until the religious
leaders will question if there even is
a correct answer, some say we have
reached that point today.”

“I don't want students to think
this is anything designed against
them. It’s necessary if we’re going
to keep the downtown a viable sec-
tor of the economy,” Derrick said.

“The attitude of this administra-
tion is that we recognize what the
school does for the community. But
we also recognize our duty to our
downtown merchants and other citi-
zens,” Derrick said.

“It’s important to the city that it
not be construed as directed at the
studenm,” he said.

Derrick said students who live in
downtown apartments will have to
find places to park other than the
street.

Derrick suggested they park in
one of the 12-hour parking lots
downtown, such as the Roy G.

lem for students, but they’re going

whoawhoa, the metric system’s gotta go

lTHE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

(

In the good old days, sometime around the birth of
Christ, the American colonists had a big meeting and
decided that the country needed to agree on a national
system of measurement. Ben Franklin’s girlfriend, who
taught elementary school, suggested that the country
adopt the metric system, which was popular in Europe
and other primitive parts of the world, and everyone
laughed and told her to shut up. “Never,” shouted the
colonists in unison, “the metric system is too hard to
use, it’s got decimal points and makes no sense.”
Finally, George Washington's rousin Elrod, who
worked in a bakery, got everyone to agree on the foot-
pound cake system which made a heck of a lot more
sense. In the foot-pound cake system there are 12
inches in a foot,’ three feet in a yard and 100 yards in
A football field.

4
.I

Ever since those early colonial days, the foot-pound
cake cake units have grown on our culture the way
green-blue algae grows on milk that’s been in your
refrigerator since the late l960s (author's note — nice
metaphor). Here's a little taste of what life would be
like without our good friend, foot-pound cake:

“Golly geesh you should a seen the big ol’ cat
ﬁsh Bubba just caught in the crlck down yonder by
the railroad tracks. I’ll bet it’s 2.5 meters long and
weighs about 13.2 kilograms.”

After hearing this metric version of a mral fishing
story you ‘can't help but agree with the patriot, Patrick
“O” Henry, when he said, “Give me foot-pound cake
units or give me death or the bubonic plague or at
least a bad cold.”

Another great thing about the foot-pound cake
system is that every other country in the world uses
the metric system. This fact has one obvious
ramification:

It makes us look cool

And another that's not so obvious unless you take
military science courses:

It helps us during armed combat with foreign
countries

For the sake of this graphic demonstration, imagine
that the U.S. is at war with Canada and a Canadian
spy learns that we are planning an ambush 20 miles
north of a small bridge. Will the Canadians be waiting
there to ambush our ambush? Never. As far as they’re
concerned, 20 miles could be a secret way of saying
the w ole plan is a big joke (not to mention the fact
that t ey don't lmow what small bridge we’re talking
about.)

If, on the other hand, an American spy learns that
Canada is planning an ambush 20 kilometers from a
small bridge, he will quickly recognize that anything
ending in “eters” is a metric unit. He will make a
quick toll—free call to one of our foreign allies and ask
them about how long it_ _would take to run 20
kilometers, giving him a rough idea of where the
ambush will take place. And eventually (assuming we
know where the bridge is) the Canadian soldiers will
cut down like trees in a tropical rain forest.

After writing that last sentence I took a little nap
and had a dream that an irate reader named Laverne
broke into my house just to ask me one question,
which she kept repeating: “Why can’t the Canadlan’s
just convert the foot-pound units to metric units like
I learned how to do in elementary school?” Next,
Laverne turned into a gigantic ﬁre ant and began
eating my fumiture. But that’s not important because I
was dreaming.

Contrary to the popular belief of Laverne and every
elementary school teacher, a metric-foot conversion is
an extremely difficult process requiring paper, pencils,
a slide ruler, and years of training in vector calculus.
Therefore, getting back to our war with Canada, if the
Canadians wanted to convert our foot-pound cake units
into metric units, they would have to waste resources
on a Math Core — a team of highly trained, hom-
rimmed army geeks.

Now that we have proved, beyond a doubt, that

America needs the foot-pound cake system, it is time
to move on to the dreadful subject of those United
States politicians who have taken time out from their
busy schedules of mailing their constituents chain
letters and other political paraphernalia to advocate
America’s conversion to the metric system. (Golly
geesh, that last sentence was about 1.6 kilometers
long).

Of course, these politicians say that the metric
system is better than foot-pound cakes because it is
based on decimals and other mathematical jargon which
is easy to use. And of course, anyone with lawn-
mower intelligence knows that these politicians are just
giving into pressure from the Metric Lobby. For those
of you with kitchen appliance level intelligence, who
have never heard of the Metric Lobby, here's a quick
summary: the Metric Lobby is a coalition of metric
road sign painters, elementary school teachers, and
illegal European aliens who, for obvious reasons, want
to convert the country to the metric system. To
counteract the powerful Metric Lobby, I urge readers to
send their politicians chain letters predicting centuries
of disaster, hardship, and metric-foot-pound cake
conversion problems for politicians who do not
immediately denounce the metric system. (Author's
note — Long live the foot-pound cake).

Bridge-the-gap

Kathekon, the third year law

From News Releases

"C-130 rolling down the strip,
Airborne daddy gonna take a little
trip," was the jody call as the

‘Washington and Lee Ranger Chal-

lenge team approached the finish
line of the 10 kilometer forced road
march, ending a weekend of tough
competition.

The Ranger Challenge Brigade
competition, held Oct. 20-22 at Fort

pA.P. Hill, north of Richmond, was

the culminating point of six weeks
of 6:30 am daily training.

The Ranger Challenge competi-
tion is ROTC’s version of a varsity
sport. The objective of the competi-
tion is to test the ROTC cadet Ran-
gers‘ physical endurance and knowl-
edge of certain military skills, as
well as to test the true meaning of
the words teamwork and motivation.

The team, although largely
drawn from the ROTC Cadet Rang-
er Company, included several new
to the event this year. Freshmen
Daniel Spinosa, Brandon Neblett,
Jennifer Miller and Jennifer Carr,
and sophmores Trevor Hildebrand,
Bill Benson, Chris Prior and Kevin
Carl comprised the bulk of the
team. The W&L team was led by
junior Andrew Manson and advised
by senior Brian Snedeker. Man-
son’s leadership was especially cru-
cial during events such as the rope
bridge and the 10k road march.

The first day events consisted of
the Army Physical Fitness test (2
minute timed push-up and timed sit-
up, 2 mile run), a timed construc-
tion of a one-rope bridge across a
water obstacle (all of the team me-
mbers, rucksacks, and weapons must
cross on the rope), a one kilometer
run leading to a rifle range ﬁre
where team members fire 20 M-16
5.56 rounds at a grouping of ten
targets in five minutes or less, and
an orienteering course located in
difficult terrain of several square
miles.

The events held on the following
day included a grenade assault
course in which each competitor
throws a total of six exploding gre-
nade simulators at a variety of tar-
gets while negotiating an obstacle
course, a timed assembly and func-
tions check of the M-60 machine
gun and the M-16 rifle from a
mixed pile of parts, and finally, the
10k forced road march carrying
weapons and 30 lbs. each of equip-
ment.

This year was a building year
for the team. Despite having several
new members and the disadvantage
of W&L’s late start of the academic
year compared to other competing
schools, the team did very pleased
with its performance. The Ranger
Challenge team is looking forward
to next year and to some new faces
trying to make the team.

MotherNature aids new construction

Staff Reports

Thanks to mild October weather
and an otherwise warm construction
season, the Lenfest Center for the
Performing Arts at Washington and
Lee University should open its
doors in less than a year.

“The completion date is Septem-
ber 1, l990," said Frank A. Par-
sons, coordinator of capital plan-
ning, “and we are confident we will
meet that deadline.”

There are two critical periods in
the construction of a building, Par-
sons said. The first is actually get-
ting the building “up and out of the
ground.”

That phase of the center was ac-
complished this summer. The steel
skeleton of the main strucmre, rising

from the banks of Woods Creek, is
visible to passersby. _
“We had our usual problem
with Rockbridge County rock, and
the necessity to bring a good deal
of fill,” Parsons said. “But those
factors created only a slight delay.”
Soon a gate house and a walk-
way, utilizing the old railroad bridge
over Nelson Street, will connect the
center with the rest of the campus.
The train station by the center
will be used as storage area. As the
center expands, the station will be
put to other uses as well.
The nex_t critical phase of con-
struction will occur in the spring

when the acoustical and lighting
systems are installed.
When completed, the Lenfest

Center will feature a 425-seat main
theater, with a proscenium stage and

Sampson then found junior Chris

After :1 sack, Sampson again

The penalty placed the ball at the

Irons in the ﬂat for a gain of 10,

John Coleman. The penalty put the

The defense held and forced a

Saturday's championship game,
more than 83 minutes of scoreless
(soccer went by before the Generals
scored the game's only goal at 6:13
bf the second half.

4 Brown, who had the ball midway

between the center circle and the
penalty box, arched a pass to senior
Scott Levitt, who glanced a shot
from eight yards out off a Blue
Marlin defender into the lower left
comer of the net.

The game was not over, though,
until Pringle dove and knocked
away a shot by a Blue Marlin play-
er as the siren sounded to end the
contest.

Pringle, who collected four saves,
registered his third straight shutout
of the season. Pringle's career total
for shutouts inched up to 12, leav-
ing him one shutout shy of tying
the school record.

“Three straight shutouts is quite

an’ "accomplishment considering.‘ the ,f

number of goals we’ve given up
this year,” Piranian said.

While freshman sweeper Greg
Williams continued his outstanding
play during the weekend, ‘it was
classmate Chase Davis who drew
the tough assignment of marking the
opposition’ top scorers. Both
Hampden-Sydney's Richard Ruth (7
goals, 3 assists) and Virginia Wes-
leyan’s Mike McFarland (7 goals, 6
assists) were held scoreless in their

games against W&L in the touma-
merit.

Playing in their fourth game in
less than a week, the Generals ap-
peared a bit ﬁat in Tuesday’s game
against VMI (5-7-1). Nevertheless,
W&L jumped out to 2-0 lead in the
first half.

Williams headed in his first goal
of the season at 16:16 off of a di-
rect kick from freshman Mike
Mitchem. The Generals scored their
second goal just over three minutes
later when Brown knocked in a run-
ning head shot off of Mitchem’s
comer kick. Mitchem’s two assists
gave him nine for the year, which
tied Brown's 1986 record for assists
in a season.

In the second half, W&L in-
creased its lead to 3-0 at 41:24
when Levitt received a pass Wil-
liams and sent a left-footed shot
into the right side of the net. At
6:34 VMI's Kevin Weiss cut the
lead to 3-1 after kicking a shot past
Pringle.

The Generals scored again at
2:26 when senior Hayward Lee,
playing in only his third game of
the season, netted the first goal of
his career of off an assist from
freshman Winthrop Allen.

From Staff Reports

Last week was a rough week for
the Washington and Lee volleyball
team.

The Generals lost four out of
five games, including three in Old
Dominion Athletic Conference play.
The last of which, to Emory and
Henry on Wednesday night, dropped
the team into a tie for fourth place
with two other teams.

The Generals started out strong
against the Wasps, winning the first
game 15-12. The Wasps, though,
were able to rebound and take the
next three to hand the Generals a
four-game setback.

Said head coach Susan Dittman
after Wednesday night’s game, “Ev-
eryone played better than they had
been against Emory and Henry. [Ju-
nior] Connie Papazickos did a good
job setting the ball for everyone,
and [senior] Debbie Grove did a
good job blocking. They beat us in
straight games every time we played
them last year, so we were pleased
to win a game off them this year.”

The Generals defeated Hollins

15-6, 15-2, but in doing so lost one
of their team leaders in sophomore
Marcy Brown for a few games. Said
Dittman, “Marcy was a key loss for
us. She was very versatile and one
of our most spirited players."

Freshman Frances Ascher ﬁlled
in for Brown against Emory and
Henry, and according to Dittman,
she ﬁlled in admirably.

On the year, Dittman has been
pleased with the play of sophomore
Meria lVlcGowin and junior Lisa
Jay. “Mena has just been outstand-
ing for us all year long. She is our
best hitter and blocker for us. Lisa
has done a terrific job setting the
ball. Debbie has also come into her
own this year. She is one of our
most spirited players and leads the
team in desire.”

The Generals will begin play in
the first round of the round-robin
ODAC tournament tomorrow.
Through a tie-breaking procedure,
W&L was seeded sixth in the tour-
nament. W&L is paired with East-
ern Mennonite, E&H, and
Randolph-Macon Woman's College.
The Generals are 7-15 overall and
5-4 in ODAC play.

On the next play, Sampson was
sacked for a loss of 10. On second
down, Sampson's pass intended for
Irons was incomplete. On third and
20, Sampson found senior Scott
Jackson, one of last year's Bridge-
water heroes, for a gain of 18 to
the 21.

The play wasn't enough for a
first down, and it brought up a do-
or-die fourth down for all the mar-
bles play. As Sampson rolled to the
right, Sohonage was the intended
receiver and was wide open, but
Sampson found all kinds of rurming
room. As he turned the comer, he
got a terrific block from Sohonage
and waltzed into the end zone with
34 seconds to play for a touchdown.

On the two point conversion at-
tempt, Fallon called the same play
that Sampson scored on. Crosby
was the intended receiver, but fell
down coming out of the backﬁeld
and Sampson was forced to scram-
ble. He ﬂoated out to the right,
making time for receivers to work
free. With defenders closing in, he
lofted a pass in the direction of
Irons, but Brarrihall out-jumped the
W&L receiver to preserve the
Bridgewater win, 17-16.

The Washington and Lee water
polo team won the W&L Invitation-
al last weekend by coming from
behind to defeat Dayton University
in the championship game, 13-11.

V The Generals, who trailed by a
goal at halftime against Dayton,
upped their record to 19-3. They
have a chance at ﬁnishing with their
best record since 1981, when the
water polo team went 31-5.

However, the nineteenth win
didn't come easy. “It would have
been very easy to lose this game,"
said head coach Page..Remillard.
“We didn't adjust to Dayton’s de-
fense in the second quarter, [and]
we didn't adjust to the officiating. It
was difﬁcult to adjust to the incon-
sistency — its hard to play a differ-
ent sport every weekend.”

Remillard elaborated on the
team's problem with modifying their
offense to attack the Dayton de-
fense. “We weren't running what
we were supposed to run, and that’s
not like us. We made mistakes we
can’t afford to make in any game."

But W&L didn't run up such a
gaudy record without being re-
sourceful, and behind three goals
from sophomores Will Davis and
Jay Smith, and freshman Scott
Strader. W&L outscored Dayton 8-5
in the second half. Strader also had
ﬁve assists. Senior David Olson
more than canceled out Dayton’s 11
goals with the 15 blocks he regis-
tered for the game.

Remillard acknowledged that ear-
lier in the year, when his team was
more inexperienced, they probably
would have lost the game. The win,
said Remillard, was a yardstick of
how far the team has progressed
since the beginning of the year.

The Generals dominated their
other opponent, Johns Hopkins,
beating them twice by a combined
score of 31-11. The offense was
superb, as W&L brutally counterat-
tacked Hopkins again and again,
resulting in the avalanche of goals
from a multitude of scorers. Fresh-
man P.J. Waicus, backing up Olson
in the goal, made several inspired
saves in the ﬁnal quarters of the
two games.

Washington and Lee got an early
preview of how difﬁcult the cham-

oint try fails

Adrian Mobley scored from six
yards out. W&L answered with a
30-yard Quayle ﬁeld goal. Bndge-
water took a 10-3 lead into the ﬁnal
period as Jake Darrell kicked a 27-
yard field goal, settingthe stage for
W&L’s late game heroics.

The loss dropped the Generals to
4-4, 1-3 in Old Dominion Athletic
Conference play, with two 8331.35
remaining. This week, W&L W111

Polo subdues Dayton;
gets ready

for tourney

pionsliip game could be on Saturday
afternoon, as Dayton was even with
them at halftime 5-5. In that game,
W&L woke up from a ﬁrst-half

funk to score nine second-half goals
and win 13-8. Sophomore Alan Her-
rick led the way with ﬁve goals,
and Davis and Smith each had
three.

Looking back from the ﬁrst
game to the second game, Rerriillard
praised Dayton for making better
adjustments for the championship,
saying that perhaps W&L was “out-
coached" in that respect.

However, he was also disappoint-
ed in the way his team responded to
his suggestions during a timeout he
called in the second quarter of the
final game. “We didn’t take the
information from the timeout back
with us into the pool,” he said. “I
was trying to take [Dayton] out of
their defense, but instead I had to
change our offensive set.”

This weekend is far and away
the biggest of the season for Wash-
ington and Lee. They host the
Southern Conference Championship,
a tournament that will determine
whether they are invited to the East-
em Championships, where the best
polo teams on the east coast will be
playing. Only the top two teams
from the Southern Conference will
be invited, and three teams stand
head and shoulders above the rest:
Arkansas-Little Rock, Richmond,
and W&L.

The Generals will play Rich-
mond Saturday at 5:00, and the
winner will get one of those two
invitations. A likely opponent for
W&L on Sunday (if they beat Rich-
mond) is Arkansas, who Remillard
calls “the best water polo team out-
side of California.”

In a game that bodes well for
the future of water polo at W&L,
the “B” team, which is made up of
freshman and inexperienced sopho-
mores, beat JHU 13-8 Saturday
morning. The Generals trailed 6-2 in
the second quarter, but hung togeth-
er and rallied to score eleven of the
last thirteen goals of the game and
win 13-8. Waicus came back from a
shaky beginning to get 10 blocks
and shut out Hopkins in the ﬁnal
quarter. James Dunleavy had four
goals to lead the offense, and John
Kannapell and Brad Martin added
two apiece.

You can live here... but not vote

 

By RJ. Thomas
Staff Reporter

You live here for most of the
year. You eat, sleep, and spend
money here, a lot of money, but
most likely you can't vote here.

Last year a group of students
tried to run a voter registration
drive but found it difficult. The lo-
cal registrar, Lucille Joyce, wouldn't
let students register. If you went to
her office she’d tell you that unless
you lived in Lexington year round
you couldn’t vote here and she’d
show you two almost entirely unre-
lated newspaper articles to prove it.
One of the articles was about stu-
dents doing jury duty and the other
was about qualifying for in-state
tuition rates for state schools. But,
though she may not have lmown it,
that registrar had much more power-
ful documents.

Virginia law allows anyone to
vote who has both domicile and
place of abode. Domicile is the im-
portant part. According to Lexington
and Rockbridge Circuit Court Judge
George Honts, an easy definition of
domicile is the place where your
home and your heart is. This is op-
posed to just living somewhere. A
soldier, for instance, may be living
in West Germany, but his home
may be in Virginia.

But who determines where your
home is? The law allows local reg-
istrars to do this. According to As-
sistant State Attorney General Greg
Haley, the local registrar is allowed
to make a case by case factual de-
termination of who is eligible to
vote in Lexington.

The qualifications spelled out in
Virginia law say that the deterrniria-
tion for who is eligible to vote is
based on certain criteria. Where you
live for the whole year, where your

Trick or treat!

Jeff Baucum offers a treat to one of the many Lexington children who
went trick-or-treating in W&L's Gaines Residence Hall Halloweeen night.
According to Catherine Baillio, head Gaines resident advisor and one. of
the event's organizers, W&L students participated by dressing up, playing
Halloween music or decorating their doors. Staff photo by Cary Baber.

car is registered and, a sore spot for
W&L students, where you pay
taxes. This raises the question of
“taxation without representation.”
But according to Haley being taxed
on personal property (the tax on
student cars would be a personal
property tax) doesn’t necessarily
give you the right to vote. If you
owned land here, for instance, but
dio‘n’t, live here, you could still be
taxed on the land and not be able to
bote.

Susan Fitz-Hugh, Secretary of
the State Board of Elections agrees
with these laws but says that there
are individual exceptions which can
be made. Exceptions can be made
on an individual basis for students
who have no where else to go, and
basically live in Lexington, even
though their base of support may
somewhere else. An example would
be a student whose parents live
overseas and has no residence any-

where else in this country.

In a case involving University of
Virginia students (Kegley v.
Johnson) a judge ruled that s stu-
dent by his mere presence in the
state does not give him the rights of
a citizen. This is especially impor-
tant in determining who qualifies for
in-state tuition at state school. Ac-
cording to the judgement, there must
be an intention to stay in the state
long after graduation. According to
the law, that intention manifests it-
self in things like registering you
car, paying taxes, how much time
you spend in the state, if you are
married and where your spouse
lives.

So as Virginia law reads, there is
no case to let ouH)f-state students
vote in Lexington. For them, the
current race is just a media show,
and displeasure with local govem-
ment will have to show itself in
other ways.

Wilder

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

The eyes of the nation focused
on Virginia’s gubernatorial election
Tuesday which resulted in Lt. Gov.
L. Douglas Wilder, the Democratic
candidate, claiming victory over Re-
publican J. Marshall Coleman by
less than 8,000 votes.

With 99 percent of Virginia pre-
cincts reporting, Wilder had 888,475
votes to Coleman’s 881,484, accord-
ing to the Roanoke Times and
World-News. WVLI-FM reported
Wilder’s lead at about 7,700 votes
yesterday afternoon.

If elected, Wilder will be the r_ia- I

tion’s first elected black governor,
but Coleman is expected to demand
a recount.

Reiss Wilks, Young Democrats
president, anticipated a victory for
Wilder.

“I feel pretty confident that
we’ll pull it of ,” Wilks said Mon-
day night.

College Republicans Vice Chair-
man Thomas Brubaker did not share
Wilks’ enthusiasm for Wilder’s suc-
cess, but was also unwilling to pre-
dict a Coleman victory.

“I think it’s going to be tight,”
Brubaker said Monday, predicting a
52 percent to 48 percent victory for

‘ The Health Education Committee
is sponsoring a teleconference con-
peming the spread of the AIDS vi-
rus in the college community, As-
sociate Dean of Students Leroy
“Buddy” Atkins said at Tuesday
iiight’s Iriterfraternity Council meet-

.“It’s definitely a worthwhile
event,” Atkins said. “It’s another
effort on the part of W&L to save

_ your 1ife.’’
‘ ( The teleconference, said Atkins,

will be shown in Northen Auditori-
in the University Library .Nov.
L6 from 1 to 4 p.m.
The conference will present sev-
lral different issues, including
edical and legal problerris associ-
ated with AIDS patients, according
to the committee’s Co—Student
Chairman, senior Nancy Hickam.

“AIDS is not a problem that
will go away,” said Hickam. “The
teleconference is designed to exam-
the campus issues and to try to de-
yelop ways we can deal with AIDS
on our campus."

4, Atkins said the teleconference is
now particularly relevant to college
sftudents.

“According to statistics from the
Centers for Disease Control, college-
age heterosexuals are now the fast-
est-growing age group contracting
AIDS,” said Atkins.

The teleconference is being
sponsored by several organizations,
including the National University
Teleconference Network and the
American College Health Associa-

1

tion, said Hickam.

In other business at Tuesday's
meeting, IFC President Kevin Nash
announced that Kathekon, W&L’s
student—alumni association, will be
holding a tailgate party before
W&L’s final football game Satur-
day, at Georgetown University in
Washington D.C.

“I encourage you to go up there
and support the team,” said Nash.
“But if you do go, you might want
to spend the night. Just watch out
for any drinking and driving.”

Nash announced there will be a
meeting for each fraternities’ presi-
dent Wednesday, Nov. 15 at 6 p.m.

“It’s just an informal meeting
for you to let us know what prob-
lerris you might have with the Judi-
cial Board,” Nash said.

Nash said there were “no prob-
lems" concerning noise violations

this past weekend.

“This was a good weekend as
far as the police go,” Nash said.
“Thanks a lot.” .

Nash said the IFC had received
no further complaints concerning
prohibited pledge activities. The
IFC, Nash said, had heard reports of
some houses holding mandatory ac-
tivities during Parents’ Weekend.

According to the IFC’s bylaws,
formal pledge actvities cannot begin
until Winter Term.

Nash also announced Kathekon
will be holding its annual “Bridge
the Gap” party in the General
Headquarters restaurant tomorrow at
6 p.m.

The party is held for undergrad-
uate seniors and third-year law stu-
dents. Admission, food and drinks
are all free.

one side or the other.

Many voters believe that this
election hinged on each candidate’s
abortion stance.

“The five votes that counted the
most in this election were cast not
in Virginia but on the Supreme
Court,” said state Sen. Robert Scott,
D-Norfolk, referring to the Supreme
Court’s recent decision allowing
states more freedom to restrict abor-
tion.

Coleman supported the largely
Republican pro—life view, while Wil-
der expressed his support for a
woman’s right to choose to have an
abortion.

The campaign featured extensive
use of negative ads on both sides.

“There was Coleman mudsling-
ing,” admitted Brubaker, “but there
was Wilder mudslinging that wasn’t
given coverage.”

“[The campaigning] has been
pretty filthy,” agreed Wilks. He
called Coleman’s early campaigning
“belligerent,” and said that Wilder
just “fought fire with fire."

Virginia Military Institute’s pub-
lic information director, Tom
Joynes, said the election’s result

will have no effect on his school’s
single-sex policy.

“It would take legislative [or
legal] action to change the policy,”

A memorial service was held
last night in VMI’s Jackson Memo-

of Virginia Beach.

According to VMI spokesman
Tom Joynes, doctors say Brazier
probably died as soon as he hit the
paved utility road 40 feet below his
window. Brazier and his two room-
mates had just met their 2:30 a.m.

Ring Figure Dance, an event where
juniors are presented with their class

“Apparently he [Brazier] must

A routine investigation Saturday
conducted by VMI’s commandant,
Col. William H. Dabney, determined
the incident was a “freak accident.”

Joynes added that doctors found
no evidence of alcohol use and that
Brazier was not acting on a dare

Joynes said no disciplinary ac-

According to Joynes, Brazier’s

Bush rallies Coleman forces

By Genienne Mongno
Associate Editor

RICHMOND —- In a last—minute

Virginia’s gubenatorial election in favor of the Republi-
cans, President George Bush appeared at a rally for
Republican candidate J . Marshall Coleman last Friday.

Bush gave his full endorsement to Coleman as well
as to Sen. Eddy Dalton, the Republican candidate for
lieutenant governor, and Sen. Joseph Benedetti, the
Republican candidate for attorney general.

Dalton and Benedetti were defeated by Democrats

Donald S. Beyer Jr. and incurnbant
Mary Sue Terry.
In his speech to an audience of

who attended the rally, Bush called Coleman “a man
of integrity and experience, a man who deeply loves

this state.’ ’

“Marshall knows the issues that matter most to

Virginians,’ ’ said Bush.

The president then highlighted Coleman’s positions
on many of the major issues of the campaign, stressing

action against

Coleman’s tough attitude toward crime and the battle

against drug abuse.
“Marshall Coleman knows it’s time for action. He
knows we’ve got to go after drug dealers and drug

users. And he knows it’s time to confiscate the dealers’
ill-gotten gains an take the profit out of the drug busi-
ness,” said Bush.

Bush also adressed the issue of education saying
as convinced as I am that there is no
other issue more vital to the future of this state, this
nation and to the kind of lives our children will lead."

On the subject of tax increases in a Coleman ad-
ministration, Bush said, “Marshall Coleman is one
candidate who doesn't confuse having a vision for the

future with having a sharp eye on your wallets.”

Football ends in Georgetown

By Jason Kelley
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee will play at
Georgetown in the final football
game of the W&L season Saturday,
and Kathekon, the student-alurrini
group at W&L, is promoting the
game and encouraging all W&L stu-
dents to attend.

Kathekon had originally planned
to rent a bus to take any interested
students to Georgetown to see the
game, but those plans were cancel-
led.

Elizabeth Parkins, who works
with Kathekon in the Alumni Of-
fice, said W&L rented a bus to go
to last year's Bridgewatcr game and
there was virtually no interest

among the student body.

Wes Boyd, president of Kathe-
kon, agreed.

“In the past, turnout for these
things has been horrible,” he said.

He added that Kathekon’s goal
is simply to get students to attend.

Boyd said when Kathekon decid-
ed not to rent a bus of its own, the
group approached the Interfraterriity
Council and encouraged the fratemi-
ties to promote the game.

At least one fraternity, Kappa
Alpha, is renting a bus for the
game.

“Actually, the fraternities liked
it better this way, because they
could have alcohol on their own
busses, whereas the Kathekon bus
would have been dry,” Boyd said.

According to Ann Barton, a

member of Chi Omega, W&L’s so-
rorities also had plans to rent a bus
together to go to the game but had
to abandon those plans.

“There are just too many things
going on this weekend,” she said.

W&L’s Washington-area alunmi
chapter is sponsoring a tailgate party
before the game. It is a catered lun-
cheon and is by invitation only, but
Christie Davis, chapter coordinator
for the alunmi office, said, “I’m
sure students would be welcome to
go over and say ‘Hi,’ especially sin-
ce there are a lot of younger alunmi
in the Washington area.”

The tailgate party, which begins
at 11 a.m., will be held at the west
end of parking lot number three,
just in front of Georgetown’s
McDonough Gymnasium.

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phl, November 9, 1939

Time to take
some time off

Classes have been in session for nine weeks now and
many students are gearing up for those ten-to-twelve page
papers the professors decided en masse to have due on
November 17, the day before Thanksgiving break.

Those same students who arefeeling book weary, and
still have a paper to do, probably sit in class and think
about playing golf, and hitting the town, and every other
thing they haven’t had time to do since September.
Students daydream, and the professors have noticed.

Executive Committee President Willard Dumas,
prompted by some of the faculty, recommended to the EC
the idea of a mid-fall break be explored. The Ring-tum
Phi encourages the EC to pursue the idea of a break.
After six or seven weeks of classes, students’ interest
‘begins to wane and skipping class becomes a reasonable
altemative.

A ten-week stretch is too long for either students or
professors. After ten straight weeks of classes, students
aren’t any more interested in classwork than professors are
in grading the last forty mid-term exams.

Dumas went on to suggest a calendar for the break.
For instance, students will get a one-week break at the
six-week mark and Thanksgiving Day off, with classes
again the following day. /

mid-term, but to keep them from getting lazy from too
much vacation. Professors complain that, as it stands now,
the students retum from a November break with no
motivation and pay no attention to their work, and their
grades reﬂect it. The professors say the students take their
books home with intentions of studying, but don’t actually
study. .
Perhaps the professors and the EC need to look at the
problem from a different angle — One-week of vacation
isn’t too much, it’s not enough. An additional break will
pace the students over the term, rather than overwork
them.

Do the professors believe the students will return at the
end of a second break unable to properly prepare for their
exams? If the school divides the students’ work into two
shorter sections, they will pay more attention before
Thanksgiving break. Students won’t be so tired when
they leave, and will return to Lexington refreshed and
ready for ﬁnals.

Further, if Thanksgiving break is only Thursday,
students will divide into two camps — those who skip
classes to spend the holiday with their families and those
who stay on campus and phone home at suppertime
Thursday night.

It is easy forarea residents to recommend that students

might _be on the other table though if their families were
in Dallas or St. Louis or Miami.

Washington and Lee’s year begins later than most other
schools’. W&L students wait for school to begin, either at
home or here in Lexington, while their friends have
already retumed. Starting our school year earlier would
solve the problem. Use the time at the beginning of the
year to provide the students with a much deserved
vacation in the middle of the term, without taking away
from an important family holiday.

MY VIEW
By Richard Hill

In the Oct. 26 issue of the Phi,
Elizabeth Parkins and Pamela Patton
respond to J. Cameron Humphries
“My View” against abortion. They
claim that Carneron’s “limited
comprehension of medical fact,” his
“suspension of reality,” and his
“sophomoric tone...have no place in
an intelligent discussion on the
abortion issue.” Well, these ladies’
essay is best described in the terms
that Rep. Henry Hyde, a Republican
from Ohio, used to describe the
1988 Democratic Platform: “a large
bowl of cold soggy mush.”

The two ladies seem to believe
that Roe v. Wade is fully intact, and
that the Freedom of Choice (or
Reproductive Choice, as NOW calls
it) is a fully recognized
Constitutional concept. Think again!
When the Supreme Court decided
the case of Webster v. Reproductive
Health Services, it threw out much
of the framework of the Roe v.
Wade decision. While not
completely trashing it, they
redeﬁned the issue around a more

specific and more easily understood"
. con'cept,.=that.~of- the state’s vrighttlto ‘~
proteetiwhat they .feel is anlegritirnate“

interest.‘

It is in Roe v. Wade, where the
original three trimester system is
devised. It seems that, outside of
any contemporary medical fact, the
only reason the concept of the
trimester system came into being is
because nine is most easily
devisable by three. Justice Harry
Blackmun grossly abused the U.S.
Constitution when he wrote that
decision, and it may very well go
down in legal circles as the poorest

/ ~—'

decision in the history of the
Supreme Court. A Even many
respected liberal legal scholars,

while agreeing with the decision,
think that the legal reasoning is
poor.

To somehow deduce that the
Constitution gives women the right
to slaughter their unborn children is
one of the biggest mishaps is legal
history. Certainly Elizabeth and
Pamela would agree that it is wrong
to kill a one day old baby (who,
incidentally, carmot survive without
help from the mother), and they
would most certainly agree that laws
should make it illegal to do so; yet,
they totally disregard the rights of
the fetus and consider “a woman's
freedom to voluntarily choose an
abortion" as the ultimate right and
the ultimate consideration. Wrong
again!

What must be considered here,
in regard to Roe v. Wade, is
whether the state’s in this country
have the right to protect what they
feel is a legitimate interest. I say
that they do, and with little
exception, the Supreme Court agrees
with me. The question on the state
level is: Is a fetus a legitimate
interest for us to protect? Again, ‘I

‘say yes. _, V ,5 _
A fetus, ‘is “a human being,___
because it "is a” unique biological’

entity. If you do not believe me,
look in your biology textbook under
the section which discusses
reproduction. It will tell you that the
fetus has 46 chromosomes (23 from
each parent) in a unique pairing that
has never been seen before and will
never be seen again. The fetus
should be protected for this simple
reason. Even if it does not have
arms or legs that you can see, it has
individuality and thus is an

.individual. So killing a fetus is the

sugkf/I L M/‘Iii b1LL°$

say no to abortion?

same as murder.

As abortion is murder,
Carneron’s comparison of the lives
of fetuses to the victim of wars is
appropriate, but minuscule. Over 1.5
million fetuses are slaughtered each
year, so it follows that this is
infanticide -— clearly put, infant
genocide. It is murder in every
sense of the word, and because
murder is a crime at the state level
abortion should be as well. It is
reasonable to make abortion against
the law in all cases. Either it is, or
it is not wrong. If it is, as I
contend, than we must outlaw it
under all circumstances. To cave in
to certain exceptions opens way for
a rash of exceptions and to a
complete disregard for the law. I
feel for a woman who has been
raped, or for one who has been the
victim of incest, but they must
remember that they are carrying a
human life in them, and that human
life deserves the same protection
that they do. Although it is an old
saying, I must say it here: two
wrongs do not make a right.

The Supreme Court has wisely
decided to turn much of the issue
back to the states. Soon, with the
inevitable reversal of Roe v. Wade,
they will retum""all of,vthe__iss_ue to

Pastor favors
exact wording

My thanks go out to Mr. Hurnphries for his
reporting of the “older professor form Ber-
keley’s" remarks in your Nov. 2 issue.

Though I rriight hesitate in attributing the
success in “redeﬁning key terms within the
language,...penetrating a culture's language and
altering the manner in which they think" to
the American Atheists Society, I find this over-
all analysis of our current state to be wonder-
fully inaccurate. I can almost feel the profes-
sor’s sense of triumph as he describes the
point we have reached “where a man can
scarcely say that any morality is anything bet-
ter than ‘true for hirnself,”' though the news-
paper's help in tracking down student check-
bouncers does seem a little “retro" in this
light.

Though I concur wholeheartedly with the
professor's analysis of our present reality, I
disagree both with his interpretation and his
vision — this in spite of personally experienc-
ing the powerful attraction the vision rep-
resents. On the contrary, I stand joyously
alongside and within a tradition which claims
that our God is the world’s since the beginning
of and for all ages, and that moral statements
which we make have applicability to all homo
sapiens. It is a living tradition which reserves
without idolizing the work of science and the
arts and which refers to its theology as “ﬁdes
guaerens intellectum." It is a tradition which
experiences the pangs of growth and yet stands
confidently firm on its basic foundations. It is
a tradition which recognizes our fragile interde-
pendence and hence holds in its highest esteem
the well-being and unity of the community. It
is a tradition which candidly admits within
human nature everywhere and at every time the
coexistence of flaw and greatness, and which
seeks through joyous and humble communion
with its Redeemer to reestablish the harmony
for which it believes we were intended.

The professor is so right in pointing out
how the language has changed. But we see it

LETTERS

as temporary aberration, not permanent trend,
for, as our tradition has already seen so many
times in its multicolored history, it is our lan-
guage which best describes what it means to
be human and to live. It is now the Enlighten-
ment whose language is spent, musty and
worn. Whose good intentions have ended up in
a most fatiguing anarchy and nihilism. Which
has power to bring neither joy nor harmony.

My dream is of the day when we, the en-
lightened, the oh—so—tolerant and the properly
relevant, confess the failure of the vision in
which we placed a trust blinder than that even
of our medieval ancestors. When we realize
that for so long we had been living not with
salvation, but with the most confused of Ba-
bel’s. When, with the scales remove from our
collective eyes, we see clearly how like well-
fed, well-coiffed, well-dressed sheep, chatting
politely, we were led to the slaughter. And
how we were really not so different at all from
any of God’s people who had gone before us.

The nice thing about that day is that there
will be a mother’s arms to go back to, in
which we can once again taste joy and re-
demption, And there will be a whole new lan-
guage to learn, a language so creative, so vi-
brant and so loving to speak that we will be
bafﬂed as to how we ever got conned in the
first place.

Sincerely,
Father J. Morton Biber
Pastor, St. Partick’s

Reader says
no fall break

It was with shock and horror that I read in
last Thursday’s Phi that the Executive Commit-
tee was considering giving us a fall break mid-
way through the first semester. It was not the
thought of a fall break that appalled me. It was
the butchery of our Thanksgiving break that
would have to occur in order to have a fall
break that bothered me greatly.

According to the article, there are two ways
that fall break could be arranged. One proposal

gives us a week at midtenn, but gives us only
Thanksgiving Day off. The second would give
use a long weekend at midterm (Friday —
Monday), and three days at Thanksgiving
(Wednesday — Friday) but would require that
we come to class the Saturday after Thanksgiv-
mg.

The first suggesticm is so impractical it
hardly seems worth addressing, but since some-
one must have thought it a feasible suggestion,
here it goes. The thought of only having
Thanksgiving Day off is absurd, and wouldn’t
work even for in-state students, and for out-of-
state students it would be even worse. The
scenario: leave W&L after class on Wednes-
day, by way of furious travelling reach home
sometime Wednesday night. The next day,
gobble down the turkey, and again by furious
travelling reach Lexington in time for Friday
morning classes. Question: Who would show

‘up for Friday classes? I certainly wouldn’t;

when I go home I like to stay a little longer
that, at most, 24 pressure-filled hours. This
plan should be treated with great disdain.

The other plan isn’t much better. Again,
who would come back for Saturday classes?

.What do the professors think of this idea?

Also, this option gives the student less time
overall than the present system.

I would like to point out that Lexington is
not the most accessible place in the world.
Short breaks are not a feasible option. We are
not situated in a major city like New York or
Washington where one can hop a plane or
train with relative ease. It is a lot more hassle
to get out of Lexington. It is especially hard
for the freshmen to find rides even in Novem-
ber. It would be even harder for them to find
them in October when the student register isn't
even out. Also, there is the money question. A
lot of people come from out of state and don't
have the money to purchase five round-trip
plane tickets per year.

I thought that the school was well aware of
these problems as our present vacation sched-
ule is admirably suited to deal with them. The
present system allows us sufficient time to get
home, relax for a reasonable amount of time,
and return at a leisurely pace if so desired. It
is admirably practical. Let's not change it.

imperceptible changes in our thinking process
had removed God from the inside out, and had
léft mankind questioning whether or not any
tquth at all could be said to exist.

“My fellow Atheists, we have not yet far to

4 As the speaker concluded the first half of his;

eech, the ‘entire convention exploded inia, pro-
found sense of victory. Although no one uttered
ac single word, I felt a feeling a smugness per-

eating the room as though the battle for intel-
lectual freedom had been won, and the need for
this convention was a hoax. It was at this point

ly‘ with a grave tone in his address:

it “Yes, you celebrate inside, and I share that
jo with you. The world has nearly been
cleansed of theistic thought, but we have reached

point which I fear is turning for the worse.

' “After three centuries of slowly watching
rdigion crumble, the organized religious move-
ments of the world are fighting back. First, they

though they still claim to have it, they have

. recognized that the average man does not want

to! hear he might be going to Hell. Secondly,

w ch we have found so useful, for their own

tions against us.

‘ “In the coming years, you will notice your

.<

thiy have adopted many of our own tactics,‘

is so very tricky.

“Atheism, by definition, means to know that
God does not exist. For the past three hundred
years we have arrogantly claimed to know the
opposite of what the other religions claim on
faith. We were the bloody fools who claimed
that one must know everything. They were quite
satisfied to maintain a reasonable amount of
certainty, then accept the rest on faith. What, my
friends, we find ourselves faced with today, is
either to admit that we can't know that God
does not exist, and thus accept His absence on
faith, or to step from our Atheistic pedestal and
admit that a good many of us are really Agnos-
tic. In either case we have to be prepared to
serve ourselves a good portion of humble pie,
because we will have to admit to the peoples of
the world that we did not know as much as we
thought we did. Furthermore, if we wish to truly
maintain the title of Atheist, we must profess to
believe in that word which most of us find so
abhorrent, faith.

“You ask, we don’t know that God does not
exist? No, no one knows if He does or does not
exist. Three hundred years ago we believed the
absolute proof of His absence was only years
away. Three hundred years later we are no clos-

_'e‘r to proving His’ absence thahnrwe were when _
our founding fathers'“f1rst asked" the question,

‘Do we lcnow God exists?’

“Always remember, we were the ones who
gave faith a bad name. Let us hope then that we
can restore its good name. Now, when religion
is attempting to inch away from faith, let us get
the jump on them, and steal it from them. It is
our best hope.

“The second of these words, science, is po-
tentially the most damaging to us. In the scien-
tific endeavor to remove God from the universe,
we have succeeded in bringing him nearer than
He ever was before. From sub-atomic particles
which by scientific definition should repel, but
instead attract, to the origins of the universe,
which we should have determined by now, but
instead conclude impossible to determine, science
has discovered a universe of more order, purpose
and design than He ever anticipated. The uni-
verse operates so meticulously that even the
concept of randomness has been discounted.
Science, which was supposed to eliminate God
from our world, has ﬁrmly entrenched Him here.

“Finally, the word religion. We, as I have
mentioned, removed it from our schools, text-
books, and such. However, we increasingly find
Atheism being classified as a religion in its own
right. This, my friends, could well spell the end
of us.

“We -lmow our dialogue well: ‘What, me

religious? No, I’m an Atheist. You're not reli-
gious are you?’ Sure, under the guise of
non—religion we have enjoyed a free ride. Teach-
ers could teach Atheism to our children. That
was there job. But if they even mentioned the
Bible, or God. Well, we’d just have their job so
quickly they couldn’t see straight. Yes, the good
old days.

“Now the tables have turned. For every.

argument for against God, there usually follows
one for God, or else our teachers aren't allowed
to mention either side. The legislators now see
Atheism as a religion and can apply the same
laws to force it out of society that we used to
force it in. The free ride is over.

“Why?

“In short, we have been far to cocky, far to
arrogant with our belief. When we should have
been caring, compassionate, and open-minded,
we actually were haughty, rude, and stubborn.
Yes, we were the ones with the truth; yes, they
were the ones with lies and faith. We made
religion an either-or proposition. Either renounce
the possibility of God, or be intellectually imma-
ture. With religion, one can, conceivably, have
both.

“Two hundred fifty years ago, the beloved

Voltaire uttered 'ecrasez l'infame,’ and the skep- «

tic movement stood at its pinnacle. The most be-
loved, respected, admired person in French soci-
ety said, ‘Crush the vermin!’ He felt it was time
to stamp out the church. At the outbreak of the
French Revolution, it was a corrupt and power-
ful instution which taught very little about God,
and a great deal about the secular values which
it was supposed to preach against. Quite simply,
it isno longer the case.

“Today, we are seen as the oppressors. We
are the ones who have blown the incredible
advantage. We are the ones who face defeat.
Man is tired of becoming the hollow men we
have turned him into. Yes, three hundred years
ago man stood ready to destroy the church.
Now, he is on the verge of destroying himself.

“My fellow Atheists, I do not corrre to salute
you. We have failed, and failed miserably. This
time, as man prepares to enter the 21st century,
I fear he will stop looking to himself for an-
swers, but once more turn his eyes upward into
the heavens, as he has for thousands of years.
No, the battle is not over. The second round of
fighting has just begun. Yet, I fear the tide is
turning against us. Just let us be thankful that
the other side was founded on the principles of
faith, hope, and charity. We may ﬂnd that we
ourselves are in greatest need of them in the
years to come."

How do you react when you saw
a lot of playing time last season,
but haven’t seen as much as you
would like this season?

Last year, Phillip Sampson and
Chris Smythe shared time at quar-
terback. This year, Sampson, a se-
nior, has had a record—setting
season, and Smythe, also a senior,
hasn’t had much of an opportunity
to play.

How do you hide your time
waiting to play, Mr. Smythe?

Polo swims to Easterns

The Washington and Lee water
polo team seized a berth in the
Eastern Championships by defeating
.the University of Richmond in a
remarkable triple-overtirne thriller in
the semifinals of the Southern Con-
ference water polo championships
lost Saturday.

W&L overcame a first period
injury to senior goalie David Olson
and the loss of three starters to
fouls.

The dramatic 17-16 victory over
the Spiders more than made up for
the Generals’ loss to Arkansas-Little

, Rock in the championship game 17-
:24. Only the top two teams from the
“i‘Southem Conference were guaran-
3/teed bids to the Eastern Champion-
fships, so had W&L lost to Rich-
;-mond, their fine

regular season
would have gone for naught.
' “Our whole goal has been to get
3to Easterns and place seventh or
said senior co-captain
“Shawn Copeland.

Before facing Richmond, the
Generals blew out Lynchburg 19-8

behind five goals from junior Jon

Sbar. Senior Adam Morgan had

three goals, while Perez and fresh-
man James Dunleavy had two a-
piece. Backup goaltender P.J.
Waicus, a freshman, saw extensive
playing time and recorded 11 blocks
against only ﬁve goals allowed. The
win was W&L's 20th of the season.

Against Richmond, the Generals
had to play much of the first period
with Waicus in goal after Olson's
injury, but the team still entered the
second period with a 5-3 lead,
which pleasantly surprised head
coach Page Remillard.

However, the Spiders outscored
W&L 7-2 in the second stanza, de-
spite Olson’s return to the net,
which Remillard attributed to the
fact that Richmond was shooting at
the goal at the deep end of Cy
Twombly pool where the goalie
doesn’t have the advantage of being
able to stand on the bottom. Indeed,
when the two teams switched ends
at the beginning of the third quarter,
W&L tallied seven goals to Rich-
mond’s deuce.

W&L led 14-12 entering the fi-
nal period, when foul trouble took
its toll on the Generals. Morgan got
his third personal foul and was

ejected. The same fate fell on fresh-
man Scott Strader, who had scored

The answer is to practice hard
so you can be ready to play when
your opportunity arises, and on

  

Saturday against Ursinus College,
Sm);the got his opportunity.

And did he ever make the most
of it.

Sampson just wasn't clicking on
all cylinders, and after missing
several open receivers, disaster
struck. On a pass intended for
senior Scott Jackson, Ursinus de-
fensive back A1 Antonello stepped
in front of Jackson to intercept the
pass. 61 yards later, Antonello
crossed the goal line with the
Bears’ third touchdown of the day.

Ursinus scored on it’s previous
two drives, both resulting from
W&L turnovers. After Sampson's
first interception, the Bears scored
on an 18-yard pass from Kevin
Meehan to Mike Cohen. On W&L's

ensuing drive, tailback Kirk
Sohonage fumbled as he was iii!
and Ursinus recovered. Meehan
scored the touchdown on a five-yard
option keeper. '

Head coach Gary Fallon than
decided a change might do the
Generals well. “Phillip hasn't realfy
been on top of his game for the l t
few games. I just felt we had soriyise
receivers open, Phillip wasn’t real
sharp, and the score was 21-0. So I
decided to try Chris to see if vie
could catch a spark.” ;

Iriheriting a 21-0 deficit, Smytlie
caught fire. His first completidn
came on third and eight. It went for
20 yards to senior fullback Russell

three goals in the game. Another
crucial loss for the Generals was
sophomore “Spider-slayer Alan Her-
rick, who was also tossed out for
his third foul. Herrick had scored
five goals and recorded six steals
before fouling out.

Richmond took advantage of
their absences to hold W&L to one
goal while scoring three of their
own. After each team scored once
in the first overtime to make the
score 16-16, seldom-used senior
Randall Pearson scored the biggest
goal of his career to win the game
in the third overtime period, which
was sudden death. “I wasn’t sur-
prised at all that the goal came
from Pearson,” said Rerriillard later.

In the championship game
against Arkansas-Little Rock, W&L
was simply overrnatched and lost
quietly by a 17-4 count. The score
was 7-2 at the half, but the Gener-
als were outscored 10-2 in the sec-
ond half. Perez (two goals) 4 and
Olson (fifteen blocks) were bright
spots for the Generals.

The Eastern Water Polo Champi-
onships will be held at the Naval
Academy in Armapolis, Md. The
game against Brown is at 1:30 Sat-
urday afternoon.

Senior Patrick Brown applied
the finishing touches to his out-
standing soccer career at W&L
with a game-winning goal
against VMI on Tuesday.

During the month of October,
Brown scored four goals, all of
which were game-winners, and
also earned two assists as the
men's soccer team posted an
October record of 7-1-2.

In the post-season ODAC
tournament played this past
weekend at Liberty Hall Field,
the senior co-captain played a
key role as the men’s soccer
team won the ODAC champion-
ship. Brown scored W&L’s goal
in Friday's 1-0 semifinal win
over Harnpden-Sydney, and as-
sisted the Generals' lone goal in
their 1-0 victory against Virginia
Wesleyan in the championship
game on Saturday.

For his accomplishments,
Brown has been named The R-
ing-tum Phi’s Athlete-of-the-
Month for October.

Brown finished the 1989 sea-
son as the ODAC’s leading scor-

ATHLETE-OF-THE-MONTH

er with eight goals and five as-
sists. For his four-year career at
W&L, Brown scored 14 goals
and dished out 22 assists.
Brown's mark of 22 assists is a
W&L record. As a freshman,
Brown set a W&L record with

 

J;

Patrick Brown

nine assists in a season, a record
he now shares with freshman
Mike Mitchem. 
Brown was also only one of
three General players to start in
all 17 games. Senior forward
Scott Levitt and sophomore Jeff
Zieger were the other two.

Head coach Rolf Piranian in
was pleased that Brown was se-
lected as the Athlete of the
Month. , ¢

“He deserves it. I haven't
coached a ﬁner soccer player or I
athlete’ in (my) 14 years (as!
W&L’s coach),” Piranian said.

Overall, Brown said he had *
“a good season.” Preferring to 3
focus the attention on the team,
he said, “We had a slow start '‘
and lost a few games we should
have won, but the team played
well at the end of the season." F

Brown, who spent the first
half of the surrirner working in a *
restaurant in Hilton Head, S.C., ,
said he prepared for the 1989
season with “a lot of ninning." V

“I also played some soccer
when I returned home,” he
added.

The 5-9, 160-pound senior, a
graduate out of Lovett High
School in Atlanta, Ga., is not
sure what lays ahead for him
after graduation, but said he
wants to “enjoy what I'm '
doing.” -

Georgetown brings
bad memories of ‘88

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

Thinking about this week's W&L-Georgetown football game got me
thinking about something else I tend to associate with Georgetown, the
1988 Olympic basketball tournament.

It was a year ago when John Thompson led the United States into
Olympic play with what was supposed to the best basketball team our
amateur ranks had to offer that year.

Or was it the best team that the U.S. could ﬁeld? Hardly.

When Hersey Hawkins, the starting shooting guard went down with
a knee injury his replacement was Vemell “Bimbo” Coles from
Virginia Tech, who is a good player but had no business being on the
team. Thompson said Coles made the team largely on the grounds that
earlier in the college season, he led the Hokies to an upset over
Thompson’s Hoyas. Taking nothing away from Coles’ talent, but he
shouldn’t have been on the team. Neither should Ricky Berry, Brian
Shaw or Charles Smith (G‘town). All had good talent, but there were
better players out there to represent our country.

A look at some other possible shooting stars that probably
(definitely) should have been on the team: Rex Chapman. The streak
shooter was cut by Thompson because he shot poorly in the tryouts.
Poor shooting or not, Chapman still can keep up in a long distance

shooting contest with the best of them. He should have been on the

team.

Steve Kerr. The Arizona point guard not only led the nation in
tliree-point accuracy at 60 percent, but Kerr only turned the ball over
once a game. His shooting and ball handling played major roles in
'Arizona’s being ranked No. 1 for the better part of the season.

Another notable absence on the team was someone named Danny
Ferry, who was All—ACC for three years at Duke. Not good enough
for Thompson. Although Ferry sustained a small injury in the tryouts,
he would have been more than healthy by the time the team left for
Seoul. Ferry also would have added another three-point threat.

The last player cut was another Arizona superstar, Sean Elliott. At
_6’8", Elliott could handle the ball and shoot like a guard (another
three point threat), but was also strong enough to play inside with the
big men.

‘And how about Stacey King, who developed into one of the best
inside players in the last two years at Oklahoma. The 610” lefty can
score in a number of ways as well as play tough inside defense.

Hey John, don't you think it might be tough to defeat a team of
Kerr, Chapman, Ferry, Danny Manning and David Robinson with J.R.
Reid, Elliott, Hawkins and rebounding machine Jerome Lane coming
off the bench along with Charles Smith (Pitt.), King, Pervis Ellison
and Dan Majerle. Manning, Reid, Smith, Ellison and Majerle were all
on the team.

Sounds like a pretty tough team to beat. Tell me I’m wrong.

IS ENROLLING
IN ARMY ROTC
DIFFERENT
FROM ENLISTIIIIG?

Few times are you given the
chance to try something for
two years without obligation.
Army ROTC is one of them.

* Your freshman and sopho-
more years are an introduction
into the life of an Army officer.
You’1l attend classes that
are taught by full-time Army
officers who'll train you to
become a leader. Teach you
ethics. Land navigation. Small
unit tactics. And help you de-
velop the initiative to take
charge. —

of the day, which ties a school
record, held by among others
Sampson, brought the score to 34-
28, but Ursinus prevailed 40-28.

Crosby. After Smythe scrambled for
11 yards and another first down, the
Generals were well inside Ursinus
territory.

After keeping the ball himself on

, two option plays to get to the eight,

Smythe found a wide open Bob
Martin for W&L’s first touchdown
on the day. It was the senior tight
end’s third touchdown of the year.
After another Ursinus touchdown
extended the lead to 28-7, Smythe
got the Generals moving again.
Crosby carried for 19 yards on first
down, and after a 15 yard penalty

against the Bears, W&L was at the
32. Smythe found junior Craig Irons
for a gain of 12’and then kept
himself for a 12-yard run to get to
the eight. Smythe threw his second
touchdown pass of the day to Jack-
son, who had to adjust and catch
the ball after it had been tipped by
an Ursinus defender.

With the score 28-14, the W&L
defense forced Ursinus to punt after
just three plays. W&L took over on
its own 44, and Smythe wasted no
time. He threw a strike to a wide
open Jeff Kreis on a post pattern,
and the sophomore hauled in the
pass and waltzed into the end zone
with a 56-yard touchdown to make
the score 28-21.

Ursinus scored first to open the
second half as Meehan found his
favorite target, Jeff Hodge for a 16-
yard score to push the lead back to
34-21.

Undaunted by the Bears’ quick
score, Smythe promptly brought the
Generals back to within one
touchdown. On second down from
his own 28, Smythe rolled to his
right and lofted a pass down the
sideline. Kreis, possibly the fasted
W&L player, left his defender
behind as he caught the ball in
stride for his second score of the
day, this one a 72-yard touchdown.

Smythe's fourth touchdown pass

W&L mounted a late rally as
Smythe was able to get the Generals
deep into Ursinus territory, and
actually had a touchdown pass to
Irons called back because of a
holding penalty.

On the day, Smythe set school
records for most yards passing in a
game with 401, breaking a record
Sampson set against Randolph-
Macon earlier this year, and the
total offense record in a game with
455, smashing the record set by the
legendary Gil Bocetti in 1949, in
just three quarters of action.

“Chris’ performance on Saturday
reaffirmed our confidence in him
and his ability to come in and rally
the team, and if Phillip struggles
again this week, I won’t hesitate to
use Chris,” said Fallon.

On Saturday the Generals will
look to even their season record at
5-5 as they travel to Washington,
D.C. to take on Georgetown. Game
time is set for 1:00.

Milton Colvin: politics and parachutes

By Alisha Johnson
Staff Reporter

EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the
first of a series of articles proﬁling
professors at Washington & Lee
University. The articles will appear
every other week on the W&Ltfe
P085 5

A teacher proﬁle is a teacher
proﬁle. That is, of course, unless
the professor just so happens to be
a certain Milton Colvin, World War
II parachute demolitionist.

A third generation professor
(his father taught in the W&L Law
Colvin
has been teaching politics at Wash-

iiiigton and Lee since 1961. He is

currently specializing in U.S. foreign
policy and government, but he has
also taught US. defense policy in
the past.

Colvin received his education at
the Landon School in Washington,
D.C., and Yale University before he

was called to serve in World War II
as the commander of a demolition
section of the 509th Parachute
Infantry. He fought in Italy, France,
Belgium and Germany. After contin-
uing his studies at Yale University,
Colvin received his bachelor’s de-
gree in international relations in
1948. He was a dean’s list student,
was active in the Yale Political
Union and Zeta Psi Fraternity and
played baseball. Colvin has main-
taincd his ties to Yale by serving on
the school's alurrmi board by inter-
viewing prospective students.

Colvin recieved a doctorate de-
gree in history and anthropology
from Heidelberg University in Ger-
many in 1953.

Married to the former Maria
Countess von Kielmansegg, Colvin
is the father of five children, who
have also decided to teach on the
university level, thus becoming
members of the fourth generation of
professors in the Colvin family.

Colvin taught at Montana State Uni-
versity, the University of Chicago
and Vanderbilt and was a visiting
professor at the National War Col-
lege in Washigton, in Gottingen,
Germany, in Vienna, Austria, and at
University College in Oxford, En-
gland.

“Washington and Lee has a fine
reputation for its undergraduate
school,” said Colvin about one of
the reasons he came to W&L. “l
have always preferred to teach un-
dergraduates because they are not
intimidated and have more curiosi-
ty.” He also said W&L has a very
friendly and competent staff with
which he has enjoyed working.

Colvin is now teaching a
reduced load under the university's
phased retirement program, which
allows senior professors teach a re-
duced load for two extra years.

Around this time next year, Col-
vin plans to be doing a few of his
favorite hobbies, such as relaxing
and writing. Cturently he is work-

 

ing on a non-fiction book on inter-
national politics, titled Neutrality.
He said he enjoys sailing and ﬁsh-
ing at his summer home in Montana
on the Flathead Lake, as well as
tree farming here in Virginia about
ten miles outside of town and ski-

ing — “very slowly” he said —

VMI holds
birthday
bonanza

By Spain Brumby
Staff Reporter

Last weekend the nation’s first
military college, Virginia Military
Institute, celebrated its 150th birthday
with activities for alumni, faculty, and
cadets.

Marking its sesquicentennial year,
several VMI cadets buried a time
capsule Friday that will be uncovered
during VMI’s bicentennial year, 2039.

The time capsule, which was
buried in front of the Stonewall Jack-
son statue at VMI, contained shoulder
boards, hop tickets, a private’s belt,
an athletic schedule, a Rat Bible, a
copy of the VMI Cadet newspaper, a
Corps roster with room numbers, a
class ring, a special calculator and a
list of all the current administration
and staff.

Following the burial of the time
capsule, there was a concert in VMI’s
Cameron Hall featuring the U.S.
Army Field Band and Soldiers’ Cho-
rus under the direction of Colonel
William E. Clark.

On Saturday, VMI’s actual birth-
day, Dr. Harvey S. Sadow, an alum-
nus and member VMI Board of Visi-
tors, dedicated VMI's new science
building, which was completed in
August.

The new four-story science facility
located adjacent to Mallory Hall
contains chemistry and biology labo-
ratories, a science information center,
a specialized library, faculty offices
and supply rooms.

The grand finale of the weekend
was VMI’s 20-10 victory over its
arch rival The Citadel.

More than 8,000 people attended
the 49th playing of “The Military
Classic of the South,” making it the
second largest home game crowd in
VMI’s football history.

Fowler cites time demands

By Stacy Morrison
Editor

Fancy Dress Auditor Terance
Fowler resigned Monday night at the
Executive Committee meeting, con-
tinuing the personnel problems that
have troubled the Student Activities
Board since September.

“The reason I left is because I
didn‘t want to be a martyr for Fancy

Dress. I left for myself,” he said.
In his letter of resignation he cited
both “academic and personal
reasons.”

Fowler explained that the enor-
mous time demand the post has re-
quired was a major consideration in
his resignation. As auditor, Fowler
settled out last year’s outstanding ac-
counts, as well as wrote early budgets
for this year’s ball.

“I felt I was getting nowhere with
it all. There was nothing else I
could give up except studying, and I
wasn’t willing to do that,” said Fow-
ler.

Fancy Dress Chairman Alex Hitz
said, “I’m sorry Terance is going.
He can run that computer like nobody
else, which is something I can't do.”

Hitz said that the accounting work
for Fancy Dress has been heavier
than before. “The budget we are
presenting this year has been difficult
because it has been so much more
extensive.”

Fowler disagreed, saying the posi-

Fowler was unwilling to detail

W&L students attend rally

By Alisann McGloin

Several Washington and Lee stu-
dents and Rockbridge County resi-
dents joined hundreds of thousands of
pro-choice demonstrators at the rally
sponsored by the National Organiza-
tion for Women in Washington D.C.
Sunday, Nov. 12th.

The rally, held at the Lincoln
Memorial, was among 1,000 events
held in over 150 cities from Maine to
Alaska on a day designated by NOW
as “Mobilize for Women’s Lives.”

Pamela Simpson, an art professor
at W&L, is an officer in the local
NOW chapter consisting of about 75
members.

In preparation for the rally, the
chapter placed an advertisement in
the local newspaper and posted signs.
Simpson helped coordinate rides
among interested students and resi-
dents.

“I think the most positive expe-
rience was being surrounded by peo-
ple who share your point of view,”
Simpson said. “It‘s reassuring to
know that there are that many people
out there.”

Junior Katy Roggenburk said she
was especially interested in the
speech given by Iowa’s Lt.Gov. Jo
Anne Zimmerman, warning the pro-
testers to question the true intentions
of candidates claiming to support
their cause.

Roggenburk said she was con-
cerned with politicians claiming to be
pro—choice but failing to back their
promises once elected.

Learning for life

This afternoon in Northen Auditorium, there was a
teleconference about Acquired Immune Deﬁciency
Syndrome. We hope you went.

What images come to the mind of an average W&L
student about AIDS? Some poor, homeless man, wasting
his welfare money to shoot up heroin with a dirty needle?
Either that or some lowlife homosexual who deserves what
he gets because God willed it that way.

Dean Buddy Atkins, at the Nov. 6 Interfratemity Council
meeting, quoted statistics from the Centers for Disease
Control which say that college-age heterosexuals are the
fastest-growing age group in terms of the number of AIDS
cases. That means us. I

According to Atkins, some surveys say as many as three

in 1,000 college women have been infected with the AIDS
Vll'llS.

If those statistics hold true for W&L, then there are one
or two women here who have been infected with a disease
that allows even minor illnesses to eat away at their bodies
and minds for years, at they might not even know it yet. It
might even be someone you know.

AIDS can happen anywhere anytime, despite our best
efforts to ignore it, and the sooner we all understand that,
the better off everyone will be.

Comedian Sam Kinison once observed that the average
person, in his somewhat irreverent view, cannot name one
heterosexual who has died of AIDS. We submit that we
would like to keep it that way, particularly at W&L.

To say that AIDS presents the same threat to W&L
students as it does to those groups designated as “high
risk” is, of course, ludicrous. Equally ludicrous, however,
is the notion that W&L students are, by some miracle,
exempt from the disease.

Admittedly, the condom machine near the door to the
inﬁrmary is, at best, unusual or, at worst, offensive. To say
nothing of the condom machine in, of all places, the Gaines
laundry room, complete with a small library of AIDS
information pamphlets. Call it an “everything you wanted to
know about AIDS, but were afraid to ask” literature section.

Despite their slightly maudlin, almost comically so,
content, such sights have become, by default, a glimpse of
a rather grim reality.

It is no longer possible for us to blithely ignore the
possibility that one of us could die, right here at W&L.

It is not solely the university’s responsibility to educate
the student body about AIDS. Any such school-sponsored
program concerning AIDS would, without doubt, be the
subject of scorn and widespread disregard. We, as students,
shouldn't have to rely on the university to tell us what we
should already know.

We applaud the Health Education Committee for its
efforts in bringing the teleconference to W&L. It would be
a shame for those efforts to have been wasted because n
one cared enough to go. - -

Legal abortion: its safe and...

MY VIEW
By Pamela H. Simpson

This is in response to Richard Hill's “My
View" article in the Nov. 9 issue (“States Should
Say No To Abortion”). This gentleman was in his
turn responding to an article by Pam Patton and
Betsy 'Parkins who were in their turn responding
to an article by J. Cameron Hurnphries. So the
debate goes on. Since Richard has stated so
clearly the anti-abortion argument, I feel the
necessity to more fully state the pro—choice
position.

He is right in contending that the Supreme
Court has recently reversed the trend of 16 years
of legal decisions and seems bent on giving states
greater authority to restrict access to abortion.

. While I disagree with his analysis of Roe v. Wade

(it was not a “mishap of legal history,” it was

an assertion of the constitutional right to privacy), 0

it is nevertheless clear that in the future the debate
over abortion will be taken‘ up at the state level.

The basic difference between the anti-abortion
and the pro-choice positions is summarized in
Richard's logical syllogism: (1) A fetus is a
human being. (2) Killing a human being is
murder. (3) The states outlaw murder; therefore,
the states should outlaw all abortions. There it is,
simple as one, two, three. The problem is, of
course, that there are inherent fallacies in this
reasoning.

Let's take the first premise that a fetus is a
human being. Richard may believe that, but there

Let’s consider who is being
murdered if abortion
becomes unattainable.
Before 1973  there were at
least 100 deaths for every
1,000 performed. By con-
trast, the rate now with
safe, legal abortion is only
three per 1,000. Legal abor-
tion saves lives.

is no other clear consensus on this issue among
medical authorities, religious leaders, or scholars
of moral and ethical studies. No one can clearly
say at what “moment" life begins. Fertilization
and initial cell division of the zygote takes at least
three days. Implantation of the blastocyst begins
no sooner than six days and is not complete for
another 14 to 21 days. Two out of every three
fertilized eggs rniscarry naturally during the first
six weeks after fertilization. Is that “murder” by
some unseen forces? The problem is that if you
make no differentiation between the born and the
unborn, if you insist on anthropomorphizing a
dividing cell into a human being, then you fall
into the kind of simplistic thinking that the anti-
abortionists continue to demonstrate. It is not that
simple. I heard one local politician assert recently
that if a woman was raped and the next day took
a morning—after pill that resulted in the abortion of

a fertilized egg, then she was guilty of murder.

v

6

That is the sort of muddle-headed reasoning that '

the equation of eggs and human life leads to.

His second premise is that killing a human
being is murder, leading him to equate abortion
with murder. Let’s consider who is being
murdered if abortion becomes unattainable. Before
1973, illegal abortion was the leading killer.of
pregnant women in the United States. There were
at least 100 deaths for every 1,000 performed. By
contrast, the rate now with safe, legal abortion is
only three per 100,000. Legal abortion saves lives.
The anti—abortion position would value the
potential life of ' a developing zygote over the
already established life of a fully developed human
being.

One argument pro-choice advocates make is
that barming abortion legally would not stop
abortions at all. It would simply take us back to
the pre—l973 position where poor women and
vulnerable teenagers risked their lives to obtain
abortions, and affluent women ﬂew to foreign
countries to get them. Today, safe legal abortions
are still relatively available to everyone. The risk
of dying in pregnancy is 13 times greater than that
of dying in an abortion. Further, matemal
mortality has dropped dramatically since the
legalization of abortion —- in other words,
abortions do save lives, women's lives.

Finally, there is the conclusion Richard makes
that since the state outlaws murder, it should
outlaw all abortions. I can see where his lockstep
logic has led him to this extreme position. Most
anti-abortionists do at least allow medical

THE STUDENT VOICE OF WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

MY VIEW
By Brian Root

For the last several weeks, the
issue of legalized abortion has been
discussed to the point of exhaustion
in The Ring-tum Phi. Despite this
treatment, the newest aspect of the
debate on abortion has been over-
looked. Virginia Lt. Gov. L. Douglas
Wilder, in a political masterstroke,
raised it in the recent, somewhat
bitter race for governor — and the
result appears to have been a narrow
victory for the moderate Democrat.

Perhaps you saw some of his
commercials — the ones that weren’t
questioning Marshall Coleman’s man-
hood or descent. In particular, I refer
to the ad that pictured Wilder at
Monticello, with a statue of Thomas
Jefferson in the background, complete
with the obligatory patriotic music.

While that may sound perfectly ordi-
nary, the content of that ad has
revolutionized how abortion is dis-
cussed.

Instead of repeating the same old
pro-choice argument, Wilder brilliant-
ly turned the tables on the
Republicans. He said Coleman, who
was on record for opposing abortion
in virtually all cases, would allow the
government to interfere with the
people's right to choose. That is a
vitally important distinction.

By changing the scope of the
abortion debate, Wilder shed the
traditional view that all Democrats
are pro-big government and against
individual and state autonomy. By
doing so, "he painted Coleman as
someone who would take our rights
away. And on that ground alone,
Wilder won the govemor’s mansion.

Almost overnight, the abortion
issue went from politically untouch-
able to an absolutely essential item

that could only be avoided at the
candidate's peril.

For years, the Democrats have
based their pro—choice argument on a
tenuous ‘when does life begin’ assor-
tion. Now they are in a position to
steal the so-called high ground.

Ronald Reagan began an entire
political revolution with the simple
statement: “Let’s get the government
off the backs of the people.” But, as
Wilder has pointed out, it is in fact
the current policy of many Republi-
cans to allow the government to
intervene — a stigma usually reserved
for Democrats.

If the GOP is to win the battle of
public opinion on abortion, the party
must moderate its heretofore extreme
position, much as the Democrats must
moderate many of their positions if
they are to reclaim the White House.

Recently, two Republican gover-
nors, Thomas Kean of New Jersey
and James Thompson of Illinois, said

the GOP must either moderate its
stance on abortion or simply leave
the decision about the issue to the
individual candidates.

With the Supreme Court's recent
Webster decision giving some control
over abortion back to the states, the
issue will soon become one of, if not
the, biggest issues in state and local
politics for the next decade.

The key for either party to cap-
ture public opinion on this rather
emotionally—charged issue is modera-
tion. Both sides must control the
extreme ends of their membership.
Most opinion polls agree that the
public’s ideas on abortion lie sorne—
where between the Pat Robertsons

and the Jesse Jacksons of the world. "

For now however, the ball is in
the Republicans’ court. If their strict
overall view of abortion is not some-
how modiﬁed and moderated, they
risk losing touch with much of their
constituency, particularly women.

LETTERS

Writers give thanks for seven days

I am writing in response to the proposal in
last week's Phi to do a way with the week-long
Thanksgiving break in favor of two shorter
breaks. This proposal is ludicrous. At a school
like Washington and Lee where more than half
of the students come from outside Virginia, the
trek home can often be both arduous and
expensive. Driving long distances to go home for
a week is trying enough, much less making the
same trip twice within a month to stay for only
a few days. And for those who fly, correct me
if I’m wrong, two plane tickets cost more than
one.

It is also necessary to consider those who
aren’t on their parents’ monthly payroll. Those
students who work during their breaks in order
to make ends meet at school will tell you it is
easier to find a job over the week-long
Thanksgiving break than it would be to work
over two long weekends. Work is easier to find

and the pay is generally better over Thanksgiving
break because more employees are left to fill
voids created by vacationing employees.

I really don’t think the argument that this
first long stretch of classes makes students so
homesick and stressed out that they have to go
home before Thanksgiving is a valid one. If
some students can't spend a little over two
months without seeing their parents, then perhaps
W&L should set up a babysitting service for
them. For those who do get homesick, I’ve heard
the phone can work wonders, and for those who
get too stressed over work, try blowing off
Friday classes and having a few beers.

Sincerely,
Chris Owen, ’92

I am strongly opposed to changing the present
system of vacations. One of the great aspects of

our Thanksgiving break is its length. Having
nine days off allows time to actually do
something for the holiday. While students with
three or four-day holidays barely have time to
visit the nearest big city, W&L students have
time to go on short trips or, more importantly,
go home.

Even those from the West Coast have
enough time to warrant a trip home, a privilege
I find important on such a farnily—oriented
holiday. Yes, the first ten weeks is a long haul,
but it is worth the wait. Besides, we have
Parents’ Weekend to help us through the term.
If we split the vacation, we would have two
short breaks barely giving us the time to leave
campus: I would rather have time to go home.
In short, leave our vacations alone!

Sincerely,
Harley Walsh, ’91

The War on Drugs

MY VIEW
By Tina Vandersteel

In yet one more unreasonable
attempt to try to justify itself, the
government has picked a highly-
publicized societal “problem" and
has declared “war” on it. Today’s
“war" is on drugs, and with
“Drug Czar” William Bennett in
the general’s seat, the government

_ has pledged to conquer the
“problem.”

So, like everything else involv-
ing govemment action, someone is
going to have to pay for it. In this
case, however, we’ll pay with more
than money — we'll pay with our
freedom.

I ' A recent Washington Post-ABC

,News poll showed a" few things
people would give up to support
the war on drugs. Seventy-one
percent would make it against the
law to show the use of illegal drugs
in entertainment movies. Fifty-two
percent would allow police to
search without a court order the
houses of people suspected of sell-
ing drugs, even if friends’ houses
were sometimes searched by mis-
take. Eight—seven percent would
allow ‘officials to search student
lockers for drugs, even those not
strongly suspected of drug use.

All this, to win the war on
drugs. However, the war on drugs,
like the war on poverty, is destined
to be unwinnable because there is
no official enemy. Perhaps this will
turn into the “drug conflict" in
much the same way that Vietnam
War became the “Vietnam con-
flict." Without soldiers clearly
identifiable as North Vietnamese, it
was difficult to shoot and hit the
right person. The war was hope-
less, and so we gave it up. Hope-
fully Bush will give this up, too.

what is true for himself.

Just about then another person
returned to our table from the salad
bar. As he sat down he noticed that
his drink was missing. “Hey,” he
said, “Who took my drink?"

At about this moment, he looked
across the table to see yet another
person finishing off the last of his
Dr. Pepper. “You,” he yelled across
the table, “go get me another." It
seemed his deep voice was not con-
vincing, so he threw a roll at him.

“Why should I," returned the
voice from within the glass. I found
myself in absolute agreement with
voice in the glass. Perhaps it was his
morality to take others’ drinks. So
what if he violated a social norm or
his parents’ upbringing. Isn't being
true to one’s morality more important
than upbringing or social norm?

Yet the rest of the table did not
agree with the voice in the glass, or
with me for that matter, and they all
insisted that the voice in the glass
should go get his friend another Dr.
Pepper. I did not remember the table
establishing any rules for eating there,

whose jobs depend on there existing
impoverished people. So, if the
government could eliminate all of
America's poor people tomorrow,
they'd be out of a job. Uh oh.

The catch is — the thing that
makes it all “work” — is that
“victory" is never defined. If it
were, so too would be the budgets
to accomplish it. So, by declaring
people’s own freedom to act a
public scandal, the government can
pretend to justify it's attempt to do
the impossible — and then ask that
very society to give up money and
freedom to accomplish it.

Note, too, who the enemies are:
drug users, dealers, etc. This gives
way to the logistics problem of
trying to catch them ‘all. It worked’
World War II to drop the bomb,
but it did not work in Vietnam to
send too few soldiers.-It either will
work, or it won’t.

Then, if the government could
catch all the dealers, the regular
users, the casual users, the first
time users — in other words, any-
one who has ever used any con-
trolled substance — then, what
would be the penalties? Surely the
government would not advocate the
same more-than-useless penalty that
our “Drug Czar” recently sug-
gested for dealers, that is: public
decapitation. The government could
not afford to jail all of the people
who would be arrested. Stiff ﬁnes?
Fines would not deter users greatly,
and the fines’ collection would still
not cover the cost of catching the
people and imposing the fine.

Unless we recognize soon that
the problem is not drugs but the
laws that make them illegal, soon
we’ll have more to deal with than
paying for those useless signs that
say “Drug Free School Zone.”

hall. Hmmm, I thought to myself. It
must be some common instinct within
these people telling the voice in the
glass to replace the Dr. Pepper. The
common consensus had something to
do with the right thing to do.

Now as I finished my own drink
(mine was a Sprite), I found two
instincts within myself. The first was
to get up and get myself another one.
Yet, I must admit, I also felt the
impulse to take ‘my friend’s right
there next to me. How on the merit
of these two independent impulses
could I make up my decision?

It seemed to me that there was
also a third impulse. It didn't tell me
what to do; it told me what I ought
to do. This seemed to be the gist of
the entire evening’s discussion. My
friend who said that “morality is
passé” believed that this third instinct
was an understood set of rules which
one must follow if society is to sur-
vive. He, if he really believed what
he said he believed, did not see one
option as any better than any other.
There was no such thing as right or
wrong, just rules that man invented
as he developed to keep him from

destroying himself.

Fighting friends over morality

I, on the other hand, believed that
this third instinct was not due to a
set of survival rules, but a universal
moral code under which right and
wrong really did exist. There was
deﬁnitely an action which one should
take in a given circumstance, and an
action which one should not take.
These were not determined by utility,
but by what was right. Meanwhile,
the others at the table fought it out.
The voice in the glass claimed that
there was nothing wrong with taking
someone else's drink. Each tried to
justify why his position was correct,
but it was all in vain. If one could
really determine his own morality,
why weren't both sides correct?

Quickly the table got into such a
big fight that everyone left except me
and my friend who claimed morality
was passé. And as I sat there review-
ing all that happened, in a way I
could not help but agree with him.

I would much rather live with
people who agree that man must live
by certain rules, and disagree about
the nature of their source, than in a
society that claims there is a source,
but disagrees as to whether one
should follow the rules.

Sbar: Catching the culpable canine

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

Recently, it occurred to me that
I frequently begin articles with the
word “recently.” Recently, while
cleaning up vomit my dogs left in
my room over Parents’ Weekend, it
occurred to me that it has been a
long time since I wrote about
canines. ‘

Ever since the prehistoric days
when dogs showed man how to
make fire and urinate on mailboxes,

‘ the two species have been the best

of friends. Even in today's diversi-
fied society, with the exception of a
few bad apples, everyone loves
dogs. Scientists from the “you can
always count on your dog” school
of thought theorize that this affinity
stems form the famous canine fideli-
ty exhibited by Ulysses and his dog,

I Homer. Ulysses, the amazing Greek

hero who left home for about 20 or
30 years to kill Trojans and create
myths, finally returned to the patient
Homer, who recognized his master’s
aftershave, wagged his tail and died.

In my opinion, the “you can al-
ways count on your dog" scientists
are full of dog--—. Homer was only

intervention to save the life of mother,

would concede that a woman who is a victim of
rape should not be forced to carry to temr an
unwanted pregnancy. But Richard is right: if a
fetus is a human being and abortion is murder,
then there should be no exceptions, right? That’s
where simplistic thinking always leads you — past
the subtleties of reality. What of the parents who
face the danger of genetically impaired children?

Why should anyone be forced to bring

child with a disease like Tay-Sachs? What of the
cancer patient whose radiation therapy promises a
grossly deformed fetus? What of the diabetic who
faces blindness or even death if she carries to

home to greet Ulysses because it
was dinner time and Mrs. Ulysses
was, at that very moment, opening
the Kal Kan. Had there been a cat
or a female dog in the area at the
time, the “faithful” Homer would
have been nowhere in sight.

The real reason people like dogs
is that canines are the funniest ani-
mals on earth next to the Three
Stooges. People, who are constantly
thinking about death, cancer and
income tax, need dogs to make
them laugh. While you're sitting
there worrying about the Cuban
Missile Crisis your dog, Bullwinkle,
tiptoed over to the coffee table and
stuck his salivating red tongue into
your bowl of chocolate chip ice
cream. While you're sweating over
an upcoming Ancient Alaska history
exam, your dog, Theodore, is bark-
ing at the vacuum cleaner. And, fi-
nally, while you’re wondering what
strange environmental factors makes
someone write an article on the sub-
ject of dog humor, my dog, Chipper
is probably sleeping.

This, of course, brings me to the
inevitable subject of Chipper. Unlike
the canine movie star Lassie who is
constantly saving Timmy and his
semiretarded parents from tomados,
barn fires and acid rain, my dog,

term? Should these women be labeled murderers?

There is no area of American law that requires
one human being to sacriﬁce life, limb, blood, or
bodily organs for another person, but that is what
a total ban on abortion would do. I find most
disturbing, however, the callous disregard for
wornen’s lives that is inherent in the position that
Richard and the anti-abortionists maintain. They
view women as disposable vessels for producing
children. They wish to take away from women the
authority to safeguard their lives and health.
Giving precedence to zygotes and embryos over
living human beings relegates women to the 19th
century status of chattel.

If you are stopped
by an unfriendly
highway patrolman,
switch seats with
your dog and swear
that he was driving.

As home and family are des-

human race, especially Timmy’s
family, could not survive without
dogs, the rest of this pointless arti-
cle will advise readers who want to
take their dogs on long car trips.

saying that
irresponsible, too evil to make their own decisions
concerning their own lives.

That finally is the bottom line for the pro-
choice position. Few of us are “for" abortion. We
understand that there is great disagreement over
this essentially moral and religious issue. But just
as we would abhor a law that mandated a
particular religion, we also abhor all efforts to
legally take away the power of a woman to make
her own choices. There has been a lot of talk
lately about getting government off the backs of
people. It is time to make sure it stays out of
wombs of women as well.

Superdance male sale

By Joel Smith
Staff Reporter

Fund-raising for Washington and
Lee’s annual Muscular Dystrophy
Association Superdance begins tonight
at Southern Seminary Junior College,
when six Virginia Military Institute
cadets and four male W&L students
will be “sold” at auction, said Allen
Richardson, co-chairman of the
Superdance committee.

The dance will take place Feb. 2-
3 at the student activities pavilion.

Richardson said the Superdance
Committee hopes to surpass last
year’s total donation of $30,000,
which was the nation’s second-liigh-
est MDA contribution among col-
leges.

The committee lost a major sup-
porter when the W&L Student Activi-
ties Board decided to not provide
funds as it has in the past, forcing
the committee to explore other op-
tions for funding, Richardson said.

“Superdance appealed to the
[Interfratemity Council] for funds, but
they declined to make a donation on
the basis that fraternities would be
paying twice,” Richardson said.
“Other options are being pursued at
this time which will be forthcoming
in the next few weeks.”

One of those options, Richardson
said, is a proposal which would
“make Superdance the IFC’s ‘pet
charity’. Essentially, it would create a
charity for the Greek system at
W&L,” he said.

Richardson added the committee

also hopes to incorporate sororities in
the same role as fraternities “if
they’re able and willing to help.”

The committee also has other fund
raising events scheduled prior to the
dance. Tiny Purple Fishes, a classic
rock band made up of W&L stu-
dents, will play at Hollins College on
Nov. 28.

Richardson said the concert will
begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Hollins
Ratskellar, and admission is $3.

On Nov. 30, Richardson.said, the
committee will sponsor a Casino
Night in the General Headquarters
restaurant, which will be open to all
W&L students who are of legal
drinking age.

According to Richardson, admis-
sion will be $5, which includes $100
of play money and two beers. After
the “gambling” is over, winning par-
ticipants can spend their earnings at
an auction, at which a number of
prizes will be sold, including a dinner
cruise on Smith Mountain Lake, a
dinner at the Willson-Walker House,
several ski packages and gift certif-
icates from local stores and restau-
rants.

Richardson said the committee has
not hired a band for Saturday night
of the event. The committee is con-
sidering The Radiators, NRBQ, The
Fabulous Waller Family as well as
other bands.

According to Richardson, the com-
mittee is considering either one “big-
name” band or two medium-priced
bands.

ardson said.

Students who have suggestions or
ideas about Superdance can air them
tonight at the comrriittee’s meeting,
which will begin at 7 p.m. in room
109 of the University Center.

For any interested students who
miss this meeting, the committee will
also meet on Thursday, Nov. 30 at 7
p.m. in the same place.

On Friday night of the event,
there will be a Battle of the Bands.
There are currently six bands entered
in the competition, and there is room
for one more, Richardson said.

This year, the winner will be
determined by both a panel of judges
and audience support. The winning
bands will receive cash prizes.

In order to be a dancer in the
marathon fund raiser, participants
must make a $100 donation for a
single entry or a $125 donation for a
couple.

Dancers can raise the money by
collecting pledges for specific
amounts of money for every hour
they dance.

Participants will dance for 15
hours, and will receive free food and
refreshments throughout the wee-
kend, Richardson said.

As in the past, prizes will be
awarded to the dancers who raise the
most money. Anyone wishing to
dance should get an information
packet from the Superdance Comniit—
tee, or in Carol Calkins’ office in the
University Center.

Richardson said there are 50 com-
mittee members and members-at-
large, and anyone is welcome to join.

Registrar
to rake in
late fees

By Blair Simmons
Staff Reporter

The Registrar’s Office is ex-
pecting to collect about $1,575 in
late fees from the 63 students
who failed to sign up last Friday
for Winter term courses.

Those who missed the 4:30
deadline, 28 of whom are seniors,
will be charged $25 for late regis-
tration during the drop/add period
next term.

“Never does everybody get
registered,” said University Regis-
trar Scott Dittrnan.

In addition to the late fee, stu-
dents who failed to register will
probably face long waiting lists
for many classes.

Art Department Secretary
Betty Hickox, said there was a
high number of students wanting
to get into art and music courses.
But, she said, there was a deer-
ease in sign—ups for drama.

“We did not have anybody
camp out this semester for the
first time in a very long time, ”
Hickox said. Currently there are
waiting lists for all but four of
the courses the Art Department

offers. _ _
“I did not start any waiting

lists before Monday morning, I
just don’t do that, ” said Hickox.
“I'm just so glad it’s over. I
don’t really want to talk about
it."

Dumas said a testimony of the

unwilling to come before the EC to

not wish to become the scapegoat in

Many of the demonstrators wore
purple and white, the colors of the
suffragette movement of the early
20th‘century.

Several entertainers, including
singers Pete Seger and Ronnie Gilbert
who sang a revised version of “This
Land is Your Land” and Helen

Reddy who performed her hit “I Am

The demonstration, which began

with a sunrise service

Bush's home outside of Washington,

ended that night with sunset rallies ,

in Alaska.

In addition to the pro-choice dem-
onstrators, many anti—abortion advo-

“How am I going to get all of this
stuff into this tiny rucksack?” This
thought must have struck more than
a few of the thirty plus people from
Washington and Lee who went on the
ROTC FTX Autumn Thunder at Fort
Lee, Virginia Nov.3—5.

FTX stands for Field Training
Exercise and consists of practical
military exercises and training. This

‘FIX was held in conjunction with

Washington and Lee ROTC’s exten-
sion centers Liberty University and
Lynchburg College which provided
more than thirty additional) students.
The FIX gave students an insight
into Amiy life and helped to prepare
the third, year ROTC cadets (MS-
III’s) for advanced camp at Ft.
Bragg, North Carolina. For six
weeks after their junior year MS IHs
are tested on their leadership abilities
at Bragg’s Camp All-American.
During the FTX MS Ills assumed
various leadership positions, and the

(senior cadets (MS IVs) evaluated

their performance.

After arriving on Friday night, the
MSIVs taught a class on aspects of
barracks living, like making beds the

Army way and cleaning the barracks
for an inspection. “Lights out”

‘came early, except for those in com-

mand, who had to prepare for instruc-
tion the next day. Throughout the
weekend, the MS IVs taught the
underclassmen based on their
advanced camp experiences.

Saturday training began at 5 a.m.
with conditioning exercises and a two
mile run followed by breakfast in an
Army dining facility.

After chow, the first platoon
sighted their M-16A1 rifles on the 25
meter range by firing three round
shot groups at a small paper target.

In a separate training area not far
away, the second.platoon practiced
IMT (Individual Movement
Techniques). MS IVs taught the
younger cadets combat maneuvers
such as the “low crawl"(moving in
the prone position), the “high
crawl” (crawling on elbows and
knees) and the “3 to 5 second rush”
(maneuvering from one covered posi-
tion to the next). These techniques
minimize exposure to enemy ﬁre
while moving in a combat environ-
ment. _

,The second platoon also learned
to camouflage themselves and their
equipment to blend into a combat
environment. Meanwhile, the first

A good B.A.D. album

By Carll Flippen
Staff Reporter

Big Audio Dynamite has released its latest album, “Megatop Phoenix.”
and it proves to be one of their strongest efforts to date.

Due to band leader Mick Jone’s battle with pneumonia following the
release of their last album “Tighten Up, vol. 88" B.A.D. was relatively
dormant last year. However, Jone’s hospital stay and B.A.D.’s hiatus has
taken none of the bite out of the band’s rhythmic, dance-oriented sound.

Big Audio Dyna_rnite burst on to the music scene in the mid-80‘s following
the demise of Mick Jone’s first group, the intemationally successful punk
band The Clash.

B.A.D. was formed as a result of the collaboration between Jones and Don
Letts, Jone’s friend and co-songwriter. The groups first release was “This
is Big Audio Dynamite" contained classic B.A.D. tunes such as “Medicine
Show”, “Stone Thames”, and “BAD.”

On the strength of songs like those, B.A.D. established the basis of their
unique sound. They combined smooth tuneful melodies sung over driving
dance-floor drum machine rliythms with heavily produced sound effects and
tape clips from various sources, such as movies and songs by other artists.

The group's second album, “No. 10, Upping St.,” released in 1986, helped
develop the bands sound, continuing to rely on dance—club style programmed
beats and the integration of sound effects and tape clips. The most notable
songs from that album include “C’mon Every Beatbox,” “Sambadror.e,” and
“Limbo the Law.” ‘

Two years later, in 1988, we see the release of “Tighten up, vol. 88.”
On this album, Big Audio Dynamite experimented with a slightly paired
down sound. They shortened their songs and used almost no programmed
rhythms, relying upon drummer Greg Roberts for the backbeat of the songs.
However, they continued their trademark use of special effects and tape clips.

With the release of their new album “Megatop Phoenix,” Big Audio
Dynamite has continued the stripped down sound of their last album "by
releasing the most heavily produced album they have yet released.

They have returned to the programmed club-like beats of the first two
albums. The dance—beat rhythms are simply infectious on tracks like
“Rewind,” “Dragon Town,” and “James Brown.” The beat on “Union
Jack” sounds as if it had been snatched off the latest Tone Loc Album. Of
course, the similarity to rap music ends, as Mick Jones begins to sing catchy,
hook-laden melodies over these heavy dance-beats. B.A.D. has never made
such extensive‘use of special effects before. Five if the seventeen tracks are
made of what could be described as random music.

For instance the track "Is Yours Working Yet?” opens with some
swirling keylxoards over which one hears Alfred Hitchcock speaking. This
is suddenly interrupted by a heavy drum machine beat with keyboards
playing what sounds like an old-fashioned movie score on top.

'llais goes on for a minute or so, then as this fades out, the tape of some
nariielcss reggae band fades in brieﬂy. Although these clips may seem as if
they are chaotic and pointless, B.A.D uses these rzaidom music tracks
together, allowing the hour long record to flow along without as many of the
typical breaks between songs.

In this context, these random music tracks work very well. There is also
plenty of MTV/radio airplay material on the record.

SPORTS

. By Jay Plotkln
' Sports Editor

It was the way it should have
' been.

In the last game of the 1989

football season, the senior class went
. out with a bang Washington and
, Lee defeated Geor etown 20-10 last
, S:-ilurday in Washington, D.C.

Said head coach Gary Fallon, “I
was real happy for the seniors. We
had come up short in the two previ-

vous games, and I lcriew that they
were quite frustrated and disap-
pointed. I’m just tickled for them that
they were able to get that bad taste
out of their mouth and come away
with a victory in their last game.”

Offensively, senior quarterback
Phillip Sampson rebounded from his
rough outing at Ursinus two weeks
ago and threw two touchdown passes,
including the game-winner with just
over 12 minutes left in the game.
Slot back Scott Jackson caught a 33-
yard touchdown pass to give W&L a
10-0 lead early. Chris Smythe, whose
it-cord-setting performance against
Ursinus almost pulled out a win, also
played and moved the team briefly.

Deferisively, senior tackles Scott
Silvcrman and Dave Radulovic res-
ponded to Fallon’s claim that they
were a “swiss cheese defense with
lots of holes" and registered 10
tackles and a sack apiece. Comerbaek
Bland Warren broke up four Hoya

— passes on the afternoon in his best
effort of the season.

But it was not just the seniors
who stood out. Junior split end Craig
lions had another outstanding day,
setting the school records for catches
and receiving yards in a season with
his eight receptions for 135 yards and
:lie game-winning touchdown. Tail-

. we

Phllllp Sampson

back Kirk Sohonage, another junior,
making his second straight start in
place of Mason Pope, ran for over
100 yards, including a 69-yard
scamper that iced the game for the
Generals.

On the defensive side of the ball,
sophomore John McCallum made 10
tackles, two for a loss, had a quarter-
back sack and blocked a field goal,
after breaking a bone in his arm in
the first half. Classmate Scott Wil-
liamson was in on 10 other tackles
and had a sack. Four of Williamson’s
tatzkles were for losses. freshman Phil
Spears got his first start, replacing the
injured Greg Kiehl kept the Hoyas in
check on the right side of the line.

W&L opened the scoring after
McCallum blocked Tom Timperrnan’s
42-yard field goal attempt on Geor-
getown’s first drive. The Generals
drove down to the Hoya 15-yard line
before calling on the placement ser-
vices of junior Carter Quayle.

Seniors shine in ’89 finale

 

Cralg Irons

Quayle’s 32-yard kick was good off
the astroturf surface, and the Generals
had a 3-0 lead.

Sampson added to that total two
drives later. On fourth and two from
the Georgetown 33, Sampson found

Jackson as the Hoyas came with a,

blitz. Jackson caught a five yard pass,
turned the comer and found no one
between him and the end zone. His
touchdown made it 10-0 with 9:11 to
play in the first half.

Timpeiman got the Hoyas on the
board late in the half with a 41-yard
field goal, and the Hoyas drew even
to start the third quarter. J.J. Williams
was the Hoya who did the most
damage, carrying eight times on the
11-play, 60-yard drive, including the
last three yards into the end zone to
make the score 10-10.

To try to spark the offense, Fallon
gave Smythe a look at quarterback,
and after driving the team to mid-
field, Smythe made his only mistake

of the game. His pass intended for
Irons was intercepted by Sean Green,
who returned it 24 yards to the W&L
35.

The defense held, and after
another uneventful series for the
offense, Sampson was back at the
controls. “We weren't moving the
ball offensively," said Fallon, “so I
tried Chris to see if he could catch a
spark like he did at Ursinus. He
wasn't able to this week, so I
decided to go back to Phillip to
throw into the wind.”

Sampson wasted little time in
breaking the 10-10 deadlock. Two
completions to Irons netted 21-yards
each, and the Generals were at the
Georgetown 23. A completion to
Sohonage got the ball to the 16,
where Sampson and Irons hooked up
for the game-winning score. It was
Sampson's 14th touchdown pass of
the year, tying the school record
which he set in 1987. Irons’ catch
tied the record for receptions in a
season with 74. Irons’ was able to
break the record help by Steve
Mahaffey on the Generals’ next pos-
session.

“It is a great pleasure to coach
talent like Craig has. He is the tough-

  
    
  
    
 
 
  

est receiver that we have ever had
here. Craig has caught the majority
of his passes going over the middle.
Most people don’t like to go over the
middle, but Craig thrives on it."

The touchdown drive came im-
mediately after Timperrnan was just
short on a 51-yard field goal try with
the wind at his back. Just as Timper-
man approached the ball, a healthy
wind died, and the kick was just
short. After the play, the wind kicked
up again.

The game was not out of reach
until the defense came up with a

Grapplers look to fresh to rebound

By John Neumann
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team under head coach Gary Franke
looks to rebound from last year’s
disappointing 2-9 record while em-
phasizing youth as nine freshmen join
only three retumers from last year’s
team.

Co—captains Lee Garlove, a senior,
and Larry Pilkey, a junior, should
provide the backbone for the young
team. Sophomore Peer Soderberg will
be counted on heavily as well. Franke
hopes the freshmen will benefit from
their experience and leadership.
Pilkey will handle the chores at 126
pounds while Garlove is the 142-
pounder. Soderberg will most likely
move up a weight class this year and
grapple at 167 pounds.

Garlove, a 1988 Academic All-
American, compiled a winning record,
4-2, in limited action last year, sitting
out much of the season with a head
injury. Garlove looked favorably upon
this year’s schedule which is loaded
with tournaments and multiple team
meets. Said Garlove, “It will be good
for both upperelassmen and freshmen.
The freshmen will gain experience by

1

wrestling multiple teams instead of
the one wrestled in dual meets.”

Pilkey also amassed a winning
record last year as well as 42 team
points, third on the team. Pilkey
hopes to be even stronger this year.
Qualifying for the national tournament
at the conclusion of the season and
wrestling effectively once there is
Pilkey’s number one goal. He feels
the team will be successful and com-
petitive “if the freshmen advance
properly and adapt to college style
wrestling.”

Pilkey applauded the schedule
which has only one week-night dual
meet noting the valuable energy
saved as the wrestlers will not be
forced to cut weight twice a week for
multiple months.

Soderberg returns to the squad for
his second season. Last year voted
the outstanding freshmen wrestler, he
compiled an 11-6 record.

Other than those three returners,
the Generals have undergone a face-
lift from last year’s team. Graduation
losses include Richard Redfoot and
Manoli Loupassi, two key perfonners
on the 1988-89 squad. Redfoot com-
piled a 23-4-1 record while becoming
an NCAA Division III semi-finalist
and the first wrestling All-American

 

 

Larry Pilkey

in Washington and Lee history. Al-
though it will be difficult, Franke
hopes some of his new freshmen can
step forward and fill these voids.,
Although the squad has had previ-
ous trouble ﬁlling all the weight
classes, the large freshmen turnout

this year should allow Franke to ﬁeld

a complete line-up. The gem of the
freshmen class could be Ryland Scott,
last year’s 160-pound Georgia state
champ. The other freshmen are
Andy Bleyer, John Conkling, Stewart
Green, Doug Lamb, Rich Paini, Cary
Potts, Jamie Selway and Andrew
Tucker.

Franke got the first competitive
look at many of his young wrestlers
Sunday when the Generals visited the
VMI Keydet Invitational. Pilkey,
Soderberg, and Conkling all placed
against strong competition. This pre-
season tournament, designed with
shortened periods, allows individuals
to gain much needed experience in
the early season and also allows
individuals to overcome pre-season
jitters. “The key was to get those
youngsters some experience and get
them over their nervousness,” said
Franke. The W&L mentor was
pleased to see_ half of the squad
place, realizing the technical aspect
will improve in the others soon.

Franke is entering his seventeenth
season as the,W"ashingtor‘i and Lee
wrestling’ coach. He has compiled 122
wins in those years, more wins than
any other W&L wrestling coach in

~ history. Rolf Pirariian will once again

handle the chores of assistant coach.

Generals ‘ready’
for tough slate

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

“There is absolutely no question
in my mind that we overachieved last
year, and I’ve told the team that
constantly,” said Washington and Lee
head basketball coach Verne Canfield.
“I also believe that there is no better
complement than to be told that you
overachiev .”

Last year, the Generals were
picked to finish fifth in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference pre-
season coaches poll. They proceeded
to win the regular season title and
come within one game of earning an
automatic bid to the NCAA Division
III post-season tournament before
falling in the conference tournament
championship game to Hampden-
Sydney.

That perforrnance earned W&L a
pre-season ranking of tenth in the
nation in Basketball Weekly.

With 10 of last year’s top 11
players returning, Canfield decided to
work the team harder this year than
in the past. “Practices have heen
geared to extend the players and push
them to be better, and they have
responded for the most part, especial-
ly the conditioning.”

Last year’s team finished 20-7,
and Canfield wants the team com-
prised of the same players to extend
themselves and their games this
season. “It is imperative that we
have are a better team this year. If
we play just as well as we did last
year, we could have a .500 season
this year. If we can extend it, we can
have a very fine year. We will have
a better team than we had last year,
but we may not win as many
games.”

Leading the returnees are four of
the five starters, including Honorable
Mention All-American junior center
Chris Jacobs. Jacobs was also the
first sophomore to win ODAC Player-
of-the-Year honors, which he did last
season. Also back is junior guard
Mike Holton, a second team All-
South Atlantic region player and
academic All-American last season.

Joining them will be classmates
Ed Hart and Craig Hatfield, both of
whom were starters last season,

. juniors Jim Casey, Andrew Manson,

Scott Alrutz and Pat Gallavan, and
sophomores Mark Melton, Courtney
Penn, Rick Hughes, John Wither-
ington and Franklin Pridgen.

This year’s team will be com-
prised of eight juniors, five soph-
omores and four freshmen. The only
loss was Lee Brading (11.2 ppg) at
shooting guard. The roles, however,
will be different. The Generals lost
more than Brading’s point-per-game
average. They also lost his valuable
senior leadership.

Holton will serve as team captain
this year, but he can’t lead the team
alone. “The nucleus of this team is a_
.year older, a year smarted, a year
wiser» and a year more experienced.’
Right now I’m a little disappointed

that I haven’t seen that manifested in »

terms of experience and leadership.”

Holton, last year’s point guard,‘
will move over to shooting guard,
where he will better be able to utilize
his three-point shooting percentage.
He led the team in three-point per-
centage last year, making 44 percent.
Casey will take over the point, where
he started five games last year. Said
Canfield, “We will be counting on
Jim to provide excellent floor leader-
ship with his balance of penetration
and outside shooting."

In the front court, Hart (11.4 ppg,
6.0 reb) and Hatﬁeld (7.4, 4.5) will
be counted on to take some of the
offensive burden off Jacobs, who
averaged 19.3 points and 7.7 re-
bounds a contest last season. Said
Canfield, “Teams will be stupid to
not to try to keep Chris from scoring,
and he knows that. He will need to
pass the ball more than he did last
year, and _if I've had one problem
with him so far this year, it's that he
is overpassing."

Gallavan scored nine points in the
first half four times last year. Penn
will be looked to as a defensive
specialist. Alrutz, Witherington and
Melton will rotate in the frontcourt,
and Hughes, Manson and freshman
Bryan Watkins will spell Holton and
Casey in the backcourt.

“We have a nine-man rotation
with one or two specialist roles. One
of the specialists will be Courtney
Penn, the defensive specialist, and the
other is Pat Gallavan and he’s the
three-point shooter,” said Canfield.
“When their particular forte is on,
their playing time will increase.

“It will be alright for Chris to be
one of the reasons for our success,
and I like it that way. But I also
want everyone else in that nine-man

rotation to be able to have nights
where they can say they were the
reason for the success.”

This year’s schedule provides l'lO|
breaks for the Generals. From the
outset of the season this weekend, the
Generals will take on their toughest
slate in Canfield’s 26-year career
here. After the Tip-Off Tournament
the Generals dive head first into
ODAC play, taking on the top two
teams in the pre-season poll, Ran-
dolph-Macon and Hampden-Sydney.
R-MC is ranked third in the pre-
season Division III poll.

The ODAC could be the strongest
it has ever been. Emory and Henry
returns two all-ODAC performers
from last year’s team, and Hampden-
Sydney returns four of five starters
from the team that won the'con-
ference tournament. Virginia Wes-
leyan and Randolph-Macon are new-

comers to the conference this year‘,_

and both a perennially strong. R-MC
drops down from Division II, where
they return three starters from a team
that finished ranked in the top 20.

The key to this season, says Can-
field, is gathering some momentum
from. the start. “We’ve got to be
ready to play and play as a unit. We
will know where we stand in the
ODAC right off the bat, and if we
can do well early and get some
momentum, we'll be alright. I think
we'll be ready.” ~ ’

Swimmers open year with routs

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

Both the Washington and Lee
men’s and women's swimming teams
are experiencing transitional periods
this season due to changes in their
rosters.

Several players have dropped off
the team, yet the remaining members
and promising freshmen are more
than talented enough to continue the
aquatics prograrn’s record of Old
Dominion Athletic Conference and
NCAA national champions, according
to assistant coach Sandy Hatfield.

“I expect the men to be swim-
ming well since they just completed
a great water polo season and are in
excellent physical condition. The
women also have had an impressive
pre-season,” she said.

The women have lost five team-
mates through graduation and time-
commitment difficulties. Among those
who graduated were Elizabeth Miles
and Nancy Whalen. Miles was a two-
time ODAC and American States
Championships Swimmer-of- the-
Year and a four-time Division III
All-American. Whalen achieved the
All-ODAC status three times.

“We’ve certainly been hurt by the
loss [of these women], not only be-
cause of their physical talent, but also
because of their spirit and
leadership,” Remillard said.“That
will be especially hard to replace.
The whole team is going to have to
grow to replace that spirit.”

The W&L women have ample
talent to rely on this winter, though.

' Senior co-captain Kris Amoroso
placed first in the ODAC 200-meter
and second in the 100-meter back-
stroke and 50-meter freestyle last
year. Juniors Sharon Coleman, Carol
Darmelly, Rachelle Nock, and Kristen
Wagner all boast outstanding records.

Coleman holds a Division III All-
American title in the 200-meter but-
terﬂy, and is the defending champion
in both the 100- and 200-meter but-

Polo falters at Easterns

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

21-7 is a good record.

If you were a pitcher, it would
probably earn you a million dollar
contract. If you were a college bas-
ketball coach, it would have you
wondering where you were going to
play in the NCAA tournament.

For the members of the Wash-
ington and Lee water polo team, the
21-7 record they-earned this year is a
bittersweet accomplishment.

They returned from the Eastern
Water Polo Championships distressed
over having fallen to Brown, Slippery
Rock, and Iona, despite having been
no worse than tied at halftime of
each game.

However, that the team even got
invited to Eastems, which is reserved
for the East’s top eight teams, ful-
ﬁlled head coach Page Remillard’s
stated pre-season goal. And while the
team came away without a victory,
Remillard was convinced that it
wasn't for lack of effort. “We played
at our top all season, but when we
got to the championships we just
couldn’t keep wirming,” he explained.

W&L was placed higher in the
tournament bracket than their coach
anticipated, seeded 6th, but they
seemed intent on validating that posi-
tion with a strong first game effort
against eastern power Brown. The
Generals had lost to Brown earlier in
the year, 15-3, but they were tied at
halftime of Saturday's game, 4-4.

This was despite the ejection of
standout sophomore Will Davis early
in the second quarter for unnecessary
rough play. Davis had scored two
goals in the game at the time he was
ejected.

Brown slowly pulled away,
though, outscoring W&L by two
goals in the third quarter and one
goal in the fourth quarter to triumph
11-8. Sophomore Alan Herrick and
senior Adam Morgan each had two
goals to tie Davis for the scoring
lead.

The next game, against Slippery
Rock, was one that Remillard said he
“agonized" over. The Generals led
by three goals with just 3:45 to go in
the game, but couldn't put Slippery
Rock away, losing 11-9 in overtime.

“We just didn’t have the killer
instinct,” said Remillard. “We started
well, but if a team stayed with us we
had trouble.”

Said Herrick, “We were playing
to finish the game out. Our intensity
didn't fall off much, but it was
enough to let a team that wanted to
come back do it."

Remillard echoed this statement,
saying that his young team let their
minds wander because they thought

they had the game won.
The loss dampened ﬁne efforts by
senior goalie David Olson (11 blocks)

town's last drive. On fourth and one
from the W&L 25, Williarris carried
to the left of W&L‘s defensive line.
Freshman Lyle Smith and junior
Clark Wight combined to knock
Williarris down for no gain, and
W&L took over on downs. On the
first play, Sohonage spun through the
line and took off down the sideline.
He was caught at the Georgetown six
after a 69-yard gallop. Quayle then
capped the scoring with a 19-yard
field goal to make the score 20-10.
On the season, the Generals finish
5-5 and with a good taste in their
mouths. “This is something that will
make the winter go by a heck of a
lot better,” said Fallon. “We feel
good about what we accomplished in

terfly. Dannelly and Wagner, the
team’s distance specialists, finished in
the ODAC top four in the 500- and
1650-meter events last year. Nock
captured first place in last year's
ODAC 1()0- and 200-meter breast-
stroke competitions.

Sophomore Jody Herring won the
ODAC 100-meter freestyle and will
aid the team as its strongest sprinter.
Three freshmen, Claire Dudley, Chris-
tine Gorrnan, and Stephanie Sauers,
join the squad this year as well and
will add depth and diversity to the
team’s performance.

As for the men, Remillard and the
team are not about to rest on their
laurels. That would be tempting,
considering that the team possesses
the defending NCAA champion and

twelve—time Division III All-
American in senior David Olson, as
well as junior Jim Dunlevy, last
year's Most Improved swimmer and
defending Atlantic States champion in
the 1650-meter freestyle event.

Add to this two more All-
Americans, sophomores Chip Nord-

hoff and Jay Smith. Smith is also the-

defending ASC champion in the 100-

on defense, and Herrick, Morgan,
junior Tomas Perez, and freshman
Scott Strader on offense, each of
whom had two goals’. According to
Davis, W&L possibly hurt its chances
against Slippery Rock with such a
good effort against Brown, because
two hours after losing to Brown the
Generals had to play again.

After such a dispiriting loss, play-
ing Sunday for seventh place in the
tournament might have had little
allure for Washington and Lee, as
they lost to Iona 8-5.

Once again, the Generals played a
strong first half, only to lose their
intensity, and the game after halftime.

meter freestyle and 100-meter back-
stroke. Smith was named by the D-

III coaches as an academic All- J

American.

Despite all these achievements,
Remillard still sees room for im-
provement.

“I think  we would like to
improve our win-loss record, and I
think we’d also like to take eight
guys back to the nationals and pos-
sibly improve our finish there,” he
said.

As for right now, both Hatfield
and Rerriillard are busy assessing the
teams‘ performances and getting a
chance to evaluate the freshmen.

“It's time to assess the teams’
positions on a group and individual
basis and then work from there,”
said Hatfield.“So far, the indicators
are very positive.”

And those indicators proved true
Wednesday night as the teams opened ,
their 1989-90 season in the Cy
Twombly Pool. The women defeated
ODAC rival Randolph-Macon

time to Iona’s seven.

“After a game like Slippery Rock,
its tough to get up for another
game,” said Davis. “We went flat in
the second half — I don’t know »
why.” ,

However, the team deserves a lot
of credit for playing better than they
were expected to this season, after
they lost over 75 percent of their
scoring to graduation.

While Remillard cautions that the
team is losing a “great goaltender in
David Olson” and a lot of leadership

‘Look Who’s Talking’

Movie fails to meet hopes

T By Todd Peppers
I Staff Reporter

_ “Look Whose Talking,” the new
_John Travolta-Kirstie Alley movie, is
‘a classic example of a film that did

‘not, or more precisely could not, live

;up to its hype.
The hype did not spring from

f gaudy press releases or tantalizing
f sneak previews, but was instead in-
fflated by word of mouth. For the last
Iweek I have heard the same question
fover, and over, and over again:
I “Have you seen the new movie

‘Look Whose Talking’? It is-----.”
(You can fill in .the blank, the
popular word choices are “awesome,
wonderful, hysterical, or amazing”)
I went into the movie expecting to
see something that would reduce me
to tears of laughter. The movie
didn‘t.

To be honest I don't know how,
after the build-up my friends gave the
movie, my reaction could have been
anything but a sense of disappoint-
ment--there was no way for the ﬁlm
to overcome my false expectations.
The word “awesome” didn’t come to
mind as the ﬁnal credits rolled.

I left the theater grumbling and
depressed. I wanted to see a movie
that would forever change society's
deﬁnition of ‘ ‘entertainment. ’ ’

After further reflection, I came to
the conclusion that my initial assess-
ment of “Look Whose Talking” was
"biased. The ﬁlm is amusing. It
won’t change your life by providing
a deep philosophical message, but
.most people--myself included--don’t
usually go to the State Theater in
search of life’s answers.

The ﬁlm is cute. Not clever.
Not droll. Not revolutionary. Not
uproarious. The perfect word is
“cute.” “Look Whose Talking” is
not only a “feel good movie,” but it
might even make some party-hard
undergrads start pining for their own
little babies. I said might.

Various movie critics have written
that “Look Whose Talking” signals
John Travolta’s triumphant return to
the big screen. I agree. Travolta,
who ﬁrst burst onto the Hollywood
scene with “Saturday Night Fever,”
“Grease,” and “Urban Cowboy,”

has recently earned the title of box
ofﬁce poison.

His last film, “Perfect,” was lam-
basted by both film reviewers and
moviegoers. “Look Whose Talking”
will silence those Hollywood doubters
who claim that John Travolta’s career
is dead.

Teamed with John Travolta is
“Cheers" actress Kirstie Alley. I
must want you that my feelings to-
ward Miss Alley are not unlike my
approach to this ﬁlm: I unfortunately
have some preconceived notions about
her. I don't think that Alley is untal-
ented. But she doesn't really stretch
her dramatic skills in “Look Whose
Talking.”

Once again she plays a ﬁercely
independent, career—oriented women
that initially butts heads with an
opinionated and/or strong leading
man. Eventually, Alley’s character
will mellow and discover that she
was too cruel to her boss, or her
boyfriend, or her lover.

I am not supporting this stereo-
type, but rather growing irritated by
it. If you think I’m exaggerating, then
rent “Star Trek II” and watch Al-
ley’s performance as a ﬁercely inde-
pendent Romulan. Or see the movie
“Shoot to Kill" in which Alley
places a rough and capable mountain
guide. Or watch “Cheers” and
notice how each week Ted Danson
and Alley exchange endless verbal
abuse. They might all be believable
characters, however the word “origi-
nal” is not the most appropriate word
to describe Alley’s career.

Kirstie Alley is cast in the role of
Mollie, a C.P.A. who is having an
affair with her married client. Veter-
an actor George Segal plays the role
of the weak-willed Albert. He keeps
promising Mollie that divorce is
around the comer as soon as his wife
makes it through therapy. The only
problem: Albert’s wife is in her sev-
enteenth year of therapy.

When Alley becomes pregnant,
Albert cannot offer her support be-
cause he is going through a “selﬁsh
phase.”

The plot thickens when Mollie
suddenly goes into labor while shop-
ping. She is alone and is forced to
hail a taxi. Enter John Travolta. He

plays James, a New York cabby and
part-time flying instructor. When
Travolta walked onto the screen I
was prepared to accuse him, along
with Alley, of simply playing another
variation of the same tired character.
My pen was poised to scribble “ty-
pe-casting” across my notepad. I
never had the chance. Absent are the
“sweat-hogs,” the greased hair, 01-
ivia Newton-John, and the white suit.

Travolta’s portrayal of James is
believable and, at times, touching.
Granted director Amy Heckering
manages to sneak in the mandatory
Travolta dance scene, yet even cynics
will enjoy both Travolta’s new dance
steps AND his young dance partner.

Alley and Travolta make it to the
hospital, and we are introduced to the
character that carries the ﬁlm--
Mollie’s baby Mikey. The baby is
played by a variety of child actors
that all enchant the audience with
their cuteness. But the credit goes to
actor Bruce Willis who is baby
Mikey's “voice.” Whether you
loved “Moon1ighting” or hated “Die
Har ,” you will be a Bruce Willis
fan before the ﬁlm is over.

Every line that Willis utters is
pure magic. But even more telling,
Mikey’s reaction to the confusing
adult world does strike some chords.
Mikey is absolutely right when he
remarks that being born is the
“weirdest thing” that can happen to
a person.

When Mikey’s Grandmother leans
over and begins to jabber in that
horribly annoying baby talk, (a sin
we are allguilty of doing) Mikey
stares in disbelief and remarks “On
yeah, she’s gone.” I wish that we
heard more from Mikey and less
from the frantic Mollie.

The movie's plot centers around
Mollie’s determination to ﬁnd a prop-
er daddy for Mikey. You can guess
who that daddy will ultimately be.
Mollie’s search culminates in what I
think is the ﬁlm's most poignant
scene. James is forced to say good-
bye (permanently?) to Mikey. As he
stands over the crib, James offers
Mikey advice for the future and talks
about his father. “I could have been
a good father” he tells Mikey, but
instead the shallow and thoughtless

Albert appears destined to assume
that role.

Travolta’s restrained, yet emotion-
ally-charged, acting in this scene
convinced me that he has certainly
matured as an actor.

The ﬁlm is supported by an im-
pressive array of character actors.
Oscar—winner Olympia Dukakis is
cast as Kirstie Alley’s mother, Rosie.
Dukakis is a busy lady, she also
appears in the new movie “Dad" and
the upcoming movie “Steel Magno-
lias.”

Rosie thinks that love is some-
thing one can walk out in the street
and ﬁnd. Rosie married her husband
because he looked good in his army
uniform. There are several funny
scenes between Dukakis and Alley--
due mainly to Dukakis’ remarkable
ability to become her characters. And
Abe Vigoda, who was the stoic “Fis-
h" on “Barney Miller," proves that
he is alive and well as he plays
James’ senile Grandfather. Where
has Vigoda been for the last ten
years?

And, as mentioned before, George
Segal is the philandering Albert.
Segal is well-cast as the immoral
executive who thinks a perpetual mid-
life crisis, and a good therapist, can
explain away any indiscretions.

As I mentioned in the outset of
he article, I was disappointed in the
film. But that was more the fault of
ny listening to hype than any flaw in
he movie. John Travolta puts in a
"me performance, Kirstie Alley does
rer usual steady but unoriginal job,
and Bruce Willis was, in a word,
priceless.

When you are home over Thanks-
giving and start tiring of Mom's
turkey sandwiches, then grab your
coat, pull your little brother away
from the television, and go see
“Look Whose Talking.”

Peppers grades it a B+. You can
earn the title of “honorary movie
reviewer" if you ﬁgure out which
actress plays the voice of Mikey’s
little sister. She only has one line,
so listen carefully.

“Look Whose Talking” is rated
“P.G.-13” for rough language and
mild sexual content. It is currently

hazing

By Brian Root

A pledge “scavenger hunt,” like

of one fraternity from Virginia Tech
several weeks age, should not be
allowed to happen at Washington and
Lee, said Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Kevin Nash at Tuesday's IFC
meeting.

“It just goes to show how what
can happen with something that
seems like nothing but a good time,”
said Nash.

Virginia Tech’s chapter of Delta
Kappa Epsilon sent its pledges to
Ohio, where they had to take a pic-
ture of one pledge with a black wom-
an.

“We can’t allow any of that kind
of stuff to go on here,” Nash said
“Make sure you keep control of any
guys in your house who want to do
that kind of thing.”

Under the stipulations of the IFC
constitution, mandatory pledge activi-
ties are prohibited until the beginning
of Winter Tenn in January.

Nash also asked the fraternities to,
as they have in past years, contribute
canned foods to the annual Christmas
Basket charity. The drive, which is
run entirely in the Lexington/Rock-
bridge County area, delivers packages
of food to needy area families.

Nash asked that each fraternity

Robbery victim may have
answer in hit-and-run case

By James Lake and
Nick Thompson
of The Ring-tum Phi staff

Lexington police say the driver
responsible for the hit-and-run death
of a Washington and Lee freshman
March 16 may have been involved in
a robbery that same night.

Police said evidence showed Mary
Ashley Scarborough was struck and
killed by a 1986 or 1987 blue Honda
Accord.

Lexington Police Chief Bruce M.
Beard said his department received a
tip that three black males robbed a
blond white male about 5-foot-8 to
5-foot—lO inches tall in the East Nel-
son Street area about three minutes
before Scarborough was killed.

According to Beard, the police
believe the robbers took a gold chain,
a wallet and $250 in cash from the
victim.

fled on foot to a car similar to the
one that hit Scarborough. The car is
said to have ﬂed the area at a high
rate of speed, said Beard.

Beard said two of the three rob-
beiy suspects are in jail on unrelated
charges. But he said police have not
been able to find the victim of the
robbery, and that victim’s testimony
might be needed to corroborate the
information and to link the robbery

‘83 W&L grad murdered in South America

Todd Smith, a 1983 graduate of Washing-
ton and Lee, was tortured and murdered by
suspected communist insurgents in Peru as he
was investigating the drug trade in that coun-
try for a news story.

Smith, the editor of The Ring-tum Phi in
1983, had gone to Peru on his vacation to
conduct his investigation. Smith, the editor of

on his vacation to conduct his investigation

Smith was last seen alive Nov. 17, as he
was leaving for an airport in the city of
Uchiza, about 250 miles northeast of Lima,
Peru.

He was not seen for four days, until his
body was found tied hand and foot in the
central square of a small town in the Hual-
laga Valley in the central portion of the coun-
try.

According to reports, Smith had been
strangled, shot and beaten.

The body was found with a sign that read
“In this way die North American spies linked
to the Pentagon who are carrying out an anti-
subversive in Latin America and especially in
Peru.”

Investigators suspect Smith ww killed by

Sally Bowen, a reporter for an English-

may have been mistaken for a law—enforce-
merit agent.

Bowen said. “He (Smith) looked uncon1fort—
ably like what a Peruvian would think a Drug
Enforcement Administration agent looks like.”

“It’s an area where any outsider is sus-
pect,” said Washington Post correspondent
Michael Smith. “They could easily take you
for a DEA agent.”

‘‘I’m convinced, at least personally, they
(the Shining Path) didn’t really think he was
guilty," said Dave Dudka, W&L ‘81, a friend
of Smith’s. “These are not the kind of people
who care whether or not you’re guilty.”

The Huallaga area is notorious for its law-
less nature.

“Uchiza is a city which we do not spend
time in,” said U.S. State Department official
Charles Loveridge. “There’s no American or
Peruvian police presence there.”

The small number of army units in the
area, said Loveridge, is more concerned with
fighting the insurgency than curtailing the
drug trade.

Although more than 47 Peruvian jour-

nalists have been killed while investigating
the Peruvian drug trade since the rise of the
Shining Path in 1980, Smith is the first
American journalist to be killed.

Smith came to W&L in 1979, and was an
English major, but took several journalism
courses and participated in a journalism
internship program, as well as serving as the
editor of The Ring-tum Phi his senior year.

Smith, who spoke Spanish ﬂuently, was
keenly interested in Latin American affairs. In
1981, he studied at the Instituto Fenix lan-
guage school in Cuemavaca, Mexico. He also
won the Lee Scholarship for Latin American
research at the Library of Congress.

Following graduation, Smith worked for
the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times for three years.
In 1987, Smith left the paper and became a
freelance reporter specializing in Latin Ameri-
can affairs.

While in Central America, Smith traveled
with the Nicaraguan contras for 10 weeks and
wrote a series of stories that appeared in the
Tampa Tribune.

“He’s been very interested in Latin Amer-
ica for years,” said Tribune assignment editor
Diane Egner. “He wanted to go down to Peru
because he felt it was ripe territory for an
ambitious reporter. I told him it was very
dangerous and to take a real vacation. But he

Scarborough was killed as she
was walking south on Washington

2 a.rn.

According to police reports, the
car that hit Scarborough was traveling
west on Washington Street at the
time of the incident. Scarborough was
taken to Stonewall Jackson Hospital,
where she was pronounced dead.

After the incident, police
contacted several other area colleges
and asked them to search for the
Honda.

In addition, the Virginia Depart-
ment of Motor Vehicles provided the
police with a list of every 1987 Hon-
da registered within a 75-mile radius
of Lexington, and every Honda deal-

any Honda fitting the description
which needed repair work.

Despite the lengthy investigation,
this is the first major lead in the case

Almost 75 percent of the fresh-
man women registered for sorority
rush following a rush information
session on Sunday, Nov. 12, spon-
sored by the Panhellenic Association.

Of the 145 freshman women, 108
had registered by Friday, Nov. 17.

Five upperclass women also
registered, putting the total number
of women going through rush at 114.
This January is the first formal rush
for Chi Omega, Kappa Kappa Garn-
ma, and Kappa Alpha Theta as well
as the newly colonizing Delta Garn-
ma.

The first mandatory PHA rush
information session took place Sun-
day, Nov. 12, freshmen, as well as
some upperclass women, attended and
received an information packet put
out by the PHA.

The women were provided with
rush rules, dates, and a registration
form due Nov. 17.

What men really talk about

Sports is just a front for bowel movements and random sex

A Topical Sbar Side
By Jon Sbar

According to my editor, whose idea of a good
time is reading The Wall Street Journal, my writ-
ing needs to be more “topical.” I did not mind
this advice because I can take criticism (as long
as there are no weapons readily available). In fact,
I would say that hearing criticism became my
specialty after I overheard my fifth grade teacher
telling the principal that I deserved to be tortured
with electric kitchen appliances. The same day that
I eavesdropped on this conversation, my teacher's
car was mysteriously vandalized with rotten eggs,
molasses, and a sledgehammer. (I mean, the
authorities suspected that a sledgehammer was
used.) Naturally, this was only a coincidence; I
can take criticism (I didn't even own a sled-
gehammer when I was in ﬁfth grade; who cares if
my. best friend Jimmy had two.) ‘

mind my editor’s criticism, I have decided to write
about something topical. According to a joumalis-
tic deﬁnition that I just now made up, a “topical”
writer is “one who is able to write about some-
thing important that just happened, like a random
sexual encounter or a bowel movement."

While it's neither topical nor interesting, I feel
compelled to discuss this uncontrollable male at-
traction to discussions dealing with bowel mov-
ements and random sexual encounters. Now I’m
sure that there are thousands of women shaking
their heads and exclaiming in disbelief, “What is
he talking about, my dad (or boyfriend, brother,
plumber, lab partner, etc.) has never once in his
life mentioned these things; all he ever talks about
is sports.” I understand this protest because men
only discuss bowel movements and random sexual
encounters during those important moments of
male bonding, quickly changing the subject to
sports whenever a female approaches.

Joe (talking to a group of friends): “Yeah,
and last night this attractive large—breasted blonde

my house and takes off all of her clothes. I
undressed too, and before you know it, right there
on the kitchen table we're having...” (suddenly
Joe sees his sister approaching) “uh, hrrrrnrn, oh
yeah, we're having an argument about the best
running back in the NFL..."

To prove to myself that I can handle criticism
without becoming violent (and reaching for the
sledgehammer in my closet; I'm just joking, I
don't even own a sledgehammer), I must discuss
something that will satisfy my editor’s need for
topical writing such as the recent W&L campus
snack bar disaster.

“A disgruntled Co-op student-employee, who
said she was fed-up with point cards, wooden
nickels, Colonnade Cups and other Co-op para-
phernalia, entered the Co-op yesterday with a
double-blade battle ax and destroyed the yogurt
machine, the chicken ﬁllet grill and my editor."

Of course, I'm only kidding about my editor (I
can take criticism; I just wish I could find my

Self-worship versus God-worship

MY VIEW

By Leila Shatara and
Ted Smith

Despite all the religious denom-
inations in our society, there are es-
sentially two forms of worship —
worship of God and self-worship. A
person who believes in God (truly
believes in God as shown by placing
God as his ultimate priority) is re-
lieved of worldly pressures. On the
other hand, a narcissist spends his life
feeding his ego with false securities
such as money, clothes, cars, etc.

In today's society, the narcissist
earns more respect, because outwardly
he appears to “have it all.” The rich,
powerful, and the “educated” are
highly esteemed, while the poor,
hungry, and homeless are despised.
Why? Society teaches us to worship
that green piece of paper (in India,

 

they worship cows, but in America
we worship green slips of paper) and
all those who possess it.

Security is placed in money,
appearance, social status and all the
other beneﬁts that come with this. Do
you select rich or poor persons for
friends? Do you prefer to be around
“good-looking" or “plain” people?
Do you strive to reach the top of
success’ ladder? How many of us
strive to serve our fellow men and
women? How many of us would take
our “wisdom" to a ghetto where
your services would be greatly
needed? Or, how many of us will be
sitting on our butts in air-conditioned
offices, making big bucks, becoming
highly successful as well as highly
neglectful people?

Depending on how you answered
the aforementioned questions, you
should be able to indicate to yourself
whom you worship — God or your-
self (you can not worship both, it's
either-or). .

Belief in God is more than Sab-

bath-day rituals, saying prayers, hav-
ing religious studies, getting seminary
degrees, etc. It is a way of life
geared to serve your neighbor. If a
person truly believes in God, he
places little or no emphasis on the
external means of security — looks,
necessity to “fit in,” success in the
material world, etc. They only gear
you to better serve yourself. By plac-
ing your trust in God, He gives you
an eternal means of security that
manifests itself through love, kind-
ness, long-suffering, peace, and good-
will for your neighbors. This is the
only true means of security.

Once this basis of security is
established, your wisdom (true wis-
dom) begins. True wisdom is not
found by going to a prestigious
university. How can you claim a
distinction of going to any prestigious
educational institution that only fos-
ters increased selﬁshness?

If you want to learn selﬁshness,
you do not have to spend up to
$20,000 per year. It would be easier

join the Church of Satan. Its mem-
bers are specialists in self-worship
and all other things that this foolish-
ness entails. On the other hand, wis-
dom ﬂows from realizing that faith
in God is the only basis of security.
This wisdom manifests itself through
knowledge not only of how to better
serve yourself, but also of how to
gear your services to best help your
neighbor. Today's society is in des-
perate need of this knowledge; the
knowledge that God comes ﬁrst.

Will today's society fall prey to
the same evils — narcissism, greed,
selﬁshness, etc. — that have befallen
all of the other “great” empires in
history? Does today's society realize
that we can look at the rise and fall
of the “great” empires in history and
see one train they all share -— narcis-
sism resulting in the killing of others
as well as the destruction of the
empire itself? Will today's choice be
self-worship or worship of God? If
today's choice is narcissism, tomor-
row’s choice is death.

The Independent Union would like to thank
the Washington and Lee University administra-
tion, faculty, dorm counselors, resident assis-
tants, College Republicans, Minority Student
Association, brothers of Chi Psi, Pi Kappa
Alpha, Pi Kappa Phi, and Sigma Nu, sisters of
Chi Omega, and Kappa Alpha Theta, residents of
Gaines Hall, and freshmen for their donations to
the “Two for Turkey” food drive.

The Independent Union would like to extend
a special thanks to Dean John, Mrs. Fallon, and
the Harris Teeter management. Without their
assistance, and patience, the food drive would
not have been a success.

The Independent Union, because of the afore-
mentioned people, raised $1450. The $1450
enable the Independent Union to deliver a ﬁfteen
pound turkey, can goods, dry food, bread, fruit
and vegetables to 30 needy families in the
Rockbridge County vicinity. Also, the Indepen-
dent Union presented the Gladys Steele Shelter
with ﬁve turkeys, and $140 worth of food.

The Independent Union would like to wish
everyone a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New
Year. Again, thanks to all who contributed

Mother calls for
sober driving

You have plans for your life — goals to
reach -— a brilliant future...

So did Linda Lancaster, a doctoral candidate
at the University of Maine in Orono, Maine. On
Feb. 18, 1989, the drunken driver of a pickup
truck struck her down as she walked along a
sidewalk. Linda died three hours later.

All her goals and plans for the future were
wiped out in one senseless moment of drunken
violence — a violence our legislatures have yet
to recognize as murder — and our courts of law
waiver over justice for the victim.

You have plans for your life — but, take a
moment as you walk across campus to ponder
your chances of becoming the random victim of
a drunken driver. We all carry the same risk, as
did Linda. But with your help we can keep our
streets and sidewalks safe. -

Take a stand. Refuse to ride with an intoxi-
cated driver. Volunteer to drive a friend who has
partied too much. Write your congressmen to

John Durant, '90

initiate deterrent legislation against killer drivers:
no time off for good behavior — no suspending
half a sentence — no plea bargaining.
Do something positive, if not for yourself or
for a friend, then for someone who loves you.
Keep your future alive!

Sincerely,
Russell and Eleonor Nicholson,
Parents of Linda Lancaster

Professor busts
on editorial

A recent editorial, “Time to take some time
off," contained the following sentence: “After
six or seven weeks of classes, students’ interest
begins to wane and skipping class becomes a
reasonable alternative." To indicate to the rest of
the world that Washington and Lee students are
unable to maintain their attention and work span
longer than six or seven weeks is both embar-
rassing and unjust to the university community
at large. To indicate to parents, corporate read-
ers and others that skipping class after such a
strain is a “reasonable alternative” boarders on
the irresponsible.

;W&L’s Todd Smith

JMY VIEW
,By Brian Root

I This week, I wrote a news story
,about Todd Smith, W&L ‘83, a
journalist who was brutally murdered
‘in Peru by communist rebels. The
‘more I found about Todd, the more I
respected him. I wish I could have
met him.
Todd’s job with the Tampa Tri-
bune was to report on local govem-
*ment. The paper owed him some
vacation time, so what did he do? He
went to Peru to write a story expos-
ring the Peruvian drug trade, which he
considered largely ignored by the
media.
r Todd Smith was a journalist. One
of the best, bravest journalists I've
“encountered. That’s what journalism
‘is all about. Having the guts to go to
South America to find out the truth
‘about the drug trade that hasn't been
‘reported by the high—profile news
readers on the networks.
7 You know the saddest part? Had
‘Todd been able to write the story,

‘paper anyway.
While he was a freelance reporter,

facts? If you're lucky, you get some-
one who has courage enough to go
where the news happens, rather than
from Dan in New York.

I’ll say it again. That’s what real
journalism is all about. That’s what I
want to do when I grow up.

I hope I have the kind of dedica-
tion to be able to search for the facts,
even when I know a hell of a lot of
people don’t give a damn.

If I had a dime for every time
I’ve been told how useless journalism
is, both here at W&L and the world
in general, I would be a rich man.

I defy you to learn what I have
about Todd Smith and then tell me
how superﬂuous journalism is.

tion here. When I say “journalism,”
I don’t mean opinion articles, I don’t

hell don’t mean Dan Rather. I mean
Todd Smith.

I have but one request. After you
graduate and are working at some
random investment bank, don't just
turn on the evening news and write
off all journalism and journalists.

What Todd Smith was doing is,
at least in my rather biased opinion,
every bit as vital to our democracy as
every investment bank and C-School
major.

Questioning
CRC validity

MY VIEW
By John S. Stump

Paul Lagarde’s article in the December issue of the
Washington and Lee Spectator raises many important
questions concerning the nature, purpose and validity of
the Conﬁdential Review Committee. We all want to see
a community at Washington and Lee that is free of
harassment, but do we need the CRC? If we do, then
certainly Dean Anne Schroer-Larnont, Dean Anece
McCloud and Professor Steven H. Hobbs, the head of the
committee, will be able to tell us why. In the interest of
quelling the mounting student and faculty anger over the
cloud of vagueness and secrecy surrounding the CRC, I
ask Professor Hobbs to provide the community with clear
answers to the following questions:

1. Could you provide us with a statement of pur-
pose?

2. Could you identify the reasons for the creation of
an alternate disciplinary committee?

We all want to see a com-
munity at Washington and Lee
that is free of harassment, but
do we need the CRC?

3. Is it your belief that this committee will be better
able to deal with certain cases? If so, why?

Pro-life: abortion more than just a woman’s choice

MY VIEW

By Damon Fensterman

Indeed, the debate does go on. Professor
Pamela Simpson’s editorial in the last Ring-
tum Phi was a solid piece of journalism. She

. stated the pro—choice position clearly, but it
is precisely for that reason that I must

' respond. Prof. Simpson made some asser-
tions which I simply carmot accept.

' First, I take issue with her position on

the fetus. Although she correctly states that
no one really knows when the fetus becomes

L a living human being, it doesn't follow that
we should therefore abort without concern
for the life of the fetus.

I The fact is, as technology has advanced,
fetuses have become viable at earlier and
earlier stages. Children born as early as the
6th month are surviving to lead normal lives.
As that line moves back, we must reevaluate

*where life begins.

‘ There is no question that it begins much
earlier than was once thought. I think Prof.

4‘ Simpson would admit that life begins before
birth. My contention is that since we are so

‘unsure about where that line is, the presump-

4Il0I1 should be in favor of the unborn child.

Second, Prof. Simpson’s position on the

‘dangers of illegal abortion is highly suspect.

‘She uses emotive language to paint a picture
of poor, innocent mothers being “murdered”

By Merrill Watson

if there is no legal abortion. But this picture
is simply not borne out in reality. If a
woman chooses to undergo a medical proce-
dure (whether illegal or not), she is responsi-

_ ble for the consequences. If she dies, it is

certainly not because the state “murdered”
her.

Moreover, the figures which Prof. Simp-
son uses grossly exaggerate the dangers of
illegal abortion. I found figures from the
National Center for Health Statistics showing
the number of deaths resulting from illegal
abortions was five per 1,000 abortions
(compared to Prof. Simpson’s 100 per
1,000). Finally, Prof. Simpson’s position is
based on the false assumption that legal
abortion removes the dangers of illegal
abortions.

The fact is, illegal abortions have con-
tinued despite legalization. Although the
number has decreased, it seems that it will
not drop below a certain level.

In addition, Prof. Simpson would have
you believe that every person who would get
an abortion today would have an illegal
abortion if they had to. That is simply not

‘ the case. In fact, following the legalization of

abortion, one less illegal abortion meant 18
more legal abortions. This fact raises two
questions. First, would a prohibition (espe-
cially one with legitimate exceptions) really
cause an overwhelming number of illegal
abortions? Second, is it worth 18 more
abortions to eliminate one illegal one?

 

What is an ‘acceptable’
child? It is one thing to
argue for the mother’s
control of her body. It is
another thing to decide
whether another living
thing is ‘fit’ to live.

LI

Finally, I do not subscribe to the sim-
ple—minded reasoning” that Prof. Simpson
says must accompany the pro-life stance. She
accuses pro-lifers of holding the position that
if abortion is murder then there should be no
exceptions. I wholeheartedly disagree with
this proposition. There are exceptions to
murder. Self defense is one of them. I do
not find it so hard to accept that there could
be other exceptions to the rule of murder,
especially since the question of whose rights
are really at stake is such a unique and
sensitive question. But a prohibition with
exceptions is a far cry from carte blanche
abortion. I think the former would do a
much better job of balancing the rights at
stake.

It is interesting to note that despite her
own accusations about “simple-minded
reasoning," Prof. Simpson’s own logic leads
her into an untenable position. She argues
that mothers should be allowed to abort

because of birth defects. This is certainly not
one of the exceptions I would allow. After
all, where do you draw the line on birth
defects? What is an “acceptable" child? Do
we abort if the kid is going to have 6
ﬁngers? We certainly do not shoot retarded
people, so why should we abort babies just
because they have birth defects? Prof.
Simpson would argue here that we wouldn’t
actually be aborting defective “babies.”
They would just be defective “tissue.” But
the only reason we would abort such tissue
is that it will eventually become a “defec-
tive” baby (and adult).

It is one thing to argue for the mother's
control over her body. It is quite another
thing to decide whether or not another living
thing is “ﬁt" to live. Our society has not
yet regressed to the point where we are
willing to do away with “imperfect” people.
I don’t find that the argument for choice
justifies the argument for eugenics.

In conclusion, Prof. Simpson argues that
the pro-life position indicates a total disre-
gard for the life of the woman. Not only do
I deny that accusation, I level a similar one
at Prof. Simpson. Her argument seems to be
that the unborn child should not even be
considered. She wants us to forget about the
child and think only about the mother's
choice. If we did that, we would all opt for
abortion on demand. However, none of us is
foolish enough to pretend that there is no
life or potential for life in the womb. The

child must be considered. The risk that
abortion murders a human being is simply
too great.

If a woman has a living thing inside her
body, its rights must be considered, too. She
carmot pretend that she has the right to do
whatever she wants. Prof. Simpsm complains
that we are ignoring the rights of the wom-
an. But since 1973, the woman has been
able to do essentially what she wants. In
fact, it is the unborn child whose rights have
been completely neglected for the last 16
years. And since the pro-life position consid-.
ers both the rights of the child and those of
the mother, I find it to be the much more
reasonable position.

4 Wayne Raynal, a former Washing-
ton and Lee student, opened Night

' Owl Music after The Flip Side

cess since the return of college stu-

* dents to Lexington this fall.

Night Owl Music sells new and

, items are at least one dollar off the
list price, and the used items are sold

* with a quality money back guarantee

, not to skip or drag.

' The used albums are quality
‘ graded, and one can ask to listen to
4 the used item in the store before
purchasing it. Due to the discount
‘prices, however, there are no sales.
‘ His stock mostly consists of rock,
jazz, blues, and bluegrass. Blank
1 tapes, cleaners, and compact disc
cases are among some of the other
things he sells.

‘I Raynal also can order merchan-
‘ disc, with no obligation or deposit to

Wilson said DG has asked that
their consultant for the new W&L
chapter be permitted to observe for-

~mal rush following the open houses
on Sunday, January 24.

“They want to copy our rush as

closely as possible to make it better

afor the rushees," Wilson said. This
proposal, however, has not yet been
.approved by the PHA.

H ,With the addition of  to W&L, .
there will... also be. some ..changes .—

within the structure of the Panhel—
slenic Council.

Tuesday, the PHA approved a
proposal giving DG an immediate
vvoice in PHA meetings.

’ DG will not hold office, however,
‘until they have been formally in-

tstalled in May of 1990, when they
will also receive a vote.

DG’s rush will follow the same
‘format as that of the other three.

Wendy Wilson, PHA’s Extension
'Committee Chairman, gave DG’s
‘national representatives a list of pro-

posals concerning the January rush.
4 If approved by the PHA, DG

would be permitted to bring 25 na-

all relevant circumstances. Expres-.

sions or actions intended to further
intellectual inquiry or state an intel-
lectual position will not be considered
harassment."

The CRC is also considering
changes in its procedures, including
one that would give those convicted
by the CRC the right to have sen-
tences of suspension or expulsion
reduced by the appeals committee.
which consists of the elected faculty
members of President's Advisory
Committee.

Under current guidelines, the ap-
peals committee may, if it disagrees
with the CRC, “retum the case to
the CRC for reconsideration” but has
no direct power to reduce the CRC’s
sentence. “Subsequent sanctions im-
posed by the CRC shall be final,”
the current rules say.

But the proposed guidelines would
allow the appeals committee itself to
“either reaffirm or decrease the sanc-
tion imposed by the CRC.”

According to John, changes in the
rules for appeals followed sugges-
tions from some of the defendants
involved in cases last year. “Some
were not completely happy with the
appeals process,” John said.

The proposed guidelines also set
time limits on appeals. Current rules
set no such limits, but the CRC is
considering requiring those it convicts

to notify the appeals committee's
chairman within 48 hours of their
hearings if they plan to appeal.

John said the revisions group
would like to present its final propos-
als to Wilson and Elrod by Christ-
mas. “Our task is just to present
recommendations to the president,"
he said.

Until-that time, John said, anyone

‘interested in making other suggestions
‘should contact him"or Hobbs to make

suggestions. After Christmas, howev-
er, John said suggestions would prob-
ably best be made directly to Wilson.

Suggestions from students not on
the CRC would “very definitely” be
welcomed, said John. “This is a pro-
cess in which we need to hear from
a lot of sources," he said.

The CRC’s members are all ap-
pointed by Wilson. According to the
faculty’s “Statement of Goals for the
Disciplinary System,” their selection
“shall be based upon their reputation
for fairness and sensitivity, the ability
to maintain strict confidentiality, and
an unbiased judicial temperament."

John said the CRC’s current facul-
ty members, in addition to Hobbs, are
University Librarian Barbara Brown,
Law Prof. Ann Massie and Religion
Prof. Harlan Beckley. Student mem-
bers are junior James Rambeau, sen-
ior Scott Brisendine and third-year
law student Kymberly Oltrogge.

  
 

     
  
  

 

Leggett’s out; city in

Pet store moves into old theater lobby

By Jason Kelley
Staff Reporter

Lexington’s downtown is gaining
a new courthouse and a new pet
store, but losing a department store.

Leggett’s, a department store lo-
cated on Main Street, will close Dec.
16, while across the street, the
Monarch Pet Center opened on Nov.
18 in the lobby of the old Lyric
Theatre building.

The old Leggett’s building has
been bought by the city and will be
used to house a joint city-county
courthouse to help alleviate the
crowded conditions at the present
courthouse on the comer of Main and
Washington streets.

According to Whitney Broughman,
the owner of Monarch Pet Center, his
success “all depends on how I'm

received by W&L. If students are
interested in the animals I have, I’ll
survive.”

Brougham sells tarantulas, iguanas
and snakes, “as well as the usual
rabbits, birds and fish,” he said.

“I only need to pay the rent and
bills, since ,I’m a retired air traffic
controller and am receiving a pension
from the government,” he said.

Broughman said he purchased
many of his tables and other supplies
from Leggett’s.

According to Leggett’s manager,
Dennis McAllister, the store is clos-
ing because “there is just not enough
business in downtown to support us
any more.” He attributed the loss of
business to new shopping malls in
Staunton and Roanoke.

He said this reflects a new trend
away from downtown shopping areas
and towards malls.

Broughman said he is a part of an
effort by local businessmen to bring
business back downtown.

He said stores are staying open
later to attract evening shoppers. He
also said both Main and Jefferson
streets should be turned back into
_t_v_vo-way roads.

“We also need more parking,
when the new courthouse opens, even
the parking below the Nelson Street
Bridge will be full,” he said.

According to McAllister, the twen-
ty or so employees of Leggett’s were
offered jobs at other Leggett’s stores
in the surrounding area, but they all

contribute either two cans of food per
member or one dollar per member to
the charity.

“However, we'd prefer it if you
gave canned food instead of just
writing a check,” Nash said._ “All
these donations go right back into the
community. These people are count-
ing on us.”

Associate Dean of Students Leroy
C. “Buddy” Atkins said the drive is
well worth the effort.

“It's probably one of the most
beneﬁcial charities around here, be-
cause it's run entirely locally," At-
kins said.

In other business, Doug Chase of
the Rockbridge Area Recreational
Organization (RARO) asked the fra-
ternities to help renovate the group's
new building, the former National
Guard armory next to Lylburg Down-
ing Middle School.

“We should take Buddy Atkins

through this place if he thinks your
fraternity houses are in bad shape,”
said Chase.

Chase asked the fraternities to
volunteer time to paint the interior of
the building before its scheduled
opening in the middle of December.

“I think many fraternities have
been unfairly given a bad rap in this
town,” Chase said. “A project like
this, I think, will help to tear down
those problems with the community."

City reviews Master Plan

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

While students were spending
Thanksgiving break last week, univer-
sity officials made their first presenta-
tion of the Master Plan to an audi-
ence of city residents.

According to Frank Parsons, coor-
dinator of capital planning, the Mas-
ter Plan, a derivation of the

‘.Long-Range Plan, details anticipated

university plans for construction and
renovation for review by the Lexing-
ton Planning Comrnission and City
Council.

A part of the Master Plan that has
raised much public inquiry is Frater-
nity Renaissance, a project in which
the university will acquire the deeds
of participating fraternities’ properties
and lease them to the former owners
in exchange for renovations.

The program must overcome a
number of legal obstacles before it
can be implemented.

Parsons explained that most prop-

erty in which the university may have
an interest in developing is shielded
from zoning laws by an institutional
overlay, an exception to zoning re-
strictions for specific institutional pur-
poses.

However, when the original insti-
tutional overlay district was desig-K
nated, fraternities were not included

because the university did not antici-
pate developing their properties.

Zoning laws permitted fraternity
houses to exist inside the commercial
and historic districts, and the three
houses without that qualification —
Delta Tau Delta, Sigma Phi Epsilon,
and Phi Gamma Delta — were
granted conditional use permits, a
grandfather status which “amended
[zoning] ordinances to recognize
certain existing conditions,” accord-
ing to Parsons.

Areas which are not covered by
the institutional overlay must have
site plans approved by the Planning
Commission and City Council at
public hearings.

Parsons said that could mean as

many as 32 public hearings if each
house is renovated. Since this would
slow the progress of the renovation
programs, the university will ask the
city to subjoin fraternity properties as
institutional overlay districts.

Parsons explained that projects
under this designation that are more
than 200 feet from city property
require approval only at the Master
Plan stage.

Projects within that distance also
require Planning Commission and
City Council approval of site plans,
but not at public hearings.

The university will face another
dilemma in parking considerations.
Parsons said that zoning ordinances

passed last spring demand that for
each bed in a fraternity house there
must be at least one off-street parking
space.

Among many measures under
consideration to accommodate this
need, the university will propose to
the city the permanent closing of
Henry Street between Main and Jef-
ferson streets.

Though Parsons said the university
could offer to buy the stretch of road,
it’~s mutually preferable that the city
retain ownership but cease upkeep.
The university would be free to de-
velop the area.

Parsons said that though there may
be some opposition to the Henry
Street measure, as the road is a con-
venient turn around for travellers on
Main and Jefferson, the intersections
of Henry at those two through streets
are dangerous, and it’s safer for driv-
ers to cross over at other blocks.

Other notable proposals in the
Master Plan are an expansion to the
Law School: a new student center, a
central science library, an addition to
DuPont Hall, renovations to the Bak-
er, Davis and Gilliam freashman
dormitories; and new facilities at
Wilson Field.

Parsons said the university will
ask the city Planning Commission to
schedule a public hearing for the
Master Plan as soon as possible in
January.

Publicity Release

Let's stop the comparisons made
to the Grateful Dead, here and now.
Sure, The New Potato Caboose has
its dedicated followers, the self-pro-
claimed “Potatoheads” who trek far
and wide in their tie-dyed T-shirts to
groove with the music. And yes,
they change their repertoire night
after night to go with the ﬂow of the
crowd. They, too, have two percus-
sionisis. And yes, the band’s name-
sake comes from an obscure Dead
song, which once made up their main
repertoire. But the comparisons stop
there.

Times have changed and during
the past four years of The New Po-
tato Caboose’s existence, their music
has changed, their crowds have
changed, their goals have changed.

Now, all ages from the high
schoolers to the pressed khaki dressed
have jumped on the musical train of
The New Potato Caboose. It’s a
journey back to the attitudes of the
‘60s — when strong, meaningful,
relevant lyrics were de rigeur — but
it's mixed with the technical produc-
tion qualities of the ‘80s.

The New Potato Caboose is a
band for everyone. Formed in Wash-
ington, D.C. in 1984, the band con-
sists of eight musicians who started
out as a cover band. Their repertoire
touched on a psychedelic-rock-reggae-
folk-jazz, which meant you were as
likely to hear Jimi Hendrix's “Little
Wing” and Little Feat’s “Dixie
Chicken” as you were to hear
George Gershwin's “Summertime,”
Then, too, their main repertoire meant
Grateful Dead tunes. But gradually,
the band made detours off the Dead
track by interspersing original num-

Vii .

bers in their sets.

Over the years, especially in the
mid-Atlantic region, the Caboose
picked up more fans, no longer be-
cause of their likeness to the Dead
but more for their own sound. A
special EP of original songs for pub-
licity purposes made the rounds and
received airplay on East Coast radio
stations, and their audience mailing
list lengthened.

The Caboose kept rolling, getting
stronger, and found themselves on the
same bill with a number of well-
known acts such as The Band, John-
ny Winter, The Smithereens, Country
Joe McDonald, Dave Mason, Stanley
Jordan, The Neville Brothers and
Soviet folk-rock musician Alexander
Gretsky. ‘

Now, after four years of clubs,
colleges and festivals, the band has
arrived. They’ve reached their first
destination: a record label.

Rykodisc ho ped aboard The
Caboose, sign the band several
months ago and put them into the
recording studio to cut their first LP.
The album, titled Promising Traveler
will feature half-studio work, half live
performances recorded at The Bayou
in Washington, D.C.

The group started out doing cover
tunes because that’s what club
audiences wanted to hear, and that’s
what the band wanted to play. But
while some bands get stuck in the
Top 40 rut, spending their lives on _
the Holiday Inn house band circuit,
the Caboose wasn't about to let that
happen. Originals were the way to
go.

“I think it was helpful that we
didn’t decide to become an original
act overnight,” said Mark Mondok,
the band’s manager and lyricist.
“That’s increased our diversity, not
having to start out and write a whole

The Ring-tum Phl, November 30, 1989

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

The Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference schedule started off with a
bang Tuesday night in Harnpden-
Sydney, and the Player-of-the-Year
and his regular season champions
from a year ago sent a message to
the rest of the conference.

Junior center Chris Jacobs scored
the first and the last basket of the
game, and his Washington and Lee
Generals established themselves as a
force to be reckoned with in ODAC
play this season by defeating Hamp-
den-Sydney on the road 76-67.

After winning the W&L Tip-Off
Tournament as school let out for
Thanksgiving the Generals hit the
road for games against Emory and
Hampden-Sydney.

At Hampden-Sydney last Tuesday,
it was a battle of last year’s Old
Dominion Athletic Conference touma-
ment champs and the regular season
champs.

Hampden-Sydney forced W&L’s
hand before the game started. To
match up with the Tigers’ size, head
coach Verne Canfield decided to
insert junior guard Pat Gallavan into
the starting line-up in place of junior
Jim Casey. The Tigers start four
players 6'4” or better, and Gallavan
at 6’4", matches up better with H-
SC than does Casey at 5’10”.

But a change in the lineup was all
that the Tigers forced the Generals to
do. Jacobs scored the first six W&L
points to get the Generals out to an
early lead.

The Tigers went in front 7-6 on a
Pat Mulquin basket, but that would
be their last lead of the game. Junior
captain Mike Holton drove past Brad
Pomeroy for a basket that started the
Generals on a 15-2 run to establish a
comfortable lead in the first half at
21-9.

The Generals led at the half 37-
33 largely in part to a strong defen-
sive effort and three three-point
bombs from Holton. “I was really
pleased with the way we played team
defense," said Canfield. “I thought
Michael did a good job of establish-
ing the three—point shot when we
needed it."’

tMIl19!1in. who killed ,thi=,Ge.nera1s
last year with his three-point shoot-

ing, was liustered into a three-for-11
night from the field. Turner, a first
team All-ODAC performer as a fresh-
man last year, came into the game
averaging 26 points a game. Inside
defense by junior forward Craig Hat-
field held Turner to 15 points and
just two rebounds.

Jacobs dunks Gnerals past Sydney

In the second half, junior forward
Ed Hart made his presence felt, as he
was able to keep the Tigers at bay
with his baseline shooting. “We told
Edward to be aggressive and look for
his shot, and he did,” said Canfield.
“We just need Ed to keep playing at
the level he did against Hampden-
Sydney.”

Holton connected on a three-

pointer to start the second half, and »

after H-SC guard Mike Wilson hit a
three-point basket, the Generals went
on a 17-7 run to take a 14 point lead
at 61-47. Hart and Jacobs each con-
tributed six points during the run.

Hampden-Sydney would get no
closer than five at 63-58 with 3:25 to
play, but Hart scored six of the Gen-
erals final 13 points, and Jacobs
capped the scoring with a dunk as
the Generals stopped the Tigers 76-
67 to start the ODAC season.

Said Canfield, “I thought we sent
a message to the rest of the league
by beating Sydney, and that's what I
wanted to do. People will see that
win and realize that they will have to
fight to beat us."

Jacobs and Hart led the way for
the Generals with 20 points each.
Holton was also in double ﬁgures
with 16, and Hatfield added 11 points
and eight rebounds.

On the Tuesday of Thanksgiving
Break, the Generals traveled to Atlan-
ta to take on the Emory Eagles. In
two games last season, the teams
split, each winning on their own
home ﬂoor.

The Generals trailed at the half
37-31 and rallied to lead brieﬂy in
the second half, but Emory fought
back behind Tim Garrett, a two-time
All-American, to take a 72-67 win
from the Generals. Emory held W&L
to no three-point goals and just 38
percent shooting from the field.

Jacobs led W&L with 21 points.
Hatfield continued his strong early
season play with 15 points and 16
rebounds. Hart also finished in double
figures for the Generals with 14.

The Generals opened the season at
home by defeating Methodist and
Salisbury State in the W&L Tip-Off
Tournament, and showed a great deal
of‘ depth in winning the tournament.

In Sunday's ﬁnal against Salisbury
State, every General who played
scored as the Generals came back
from a 68-64 second half deficit to
win 97-87. Jacobs rebounded from
his worst performance in two years
with a career-high 35 to lead all
scorers and 12 rebounds. Also in
double figures for W&L were Hart
(16, 10 rebounds), Holton and Hat-
field (12 apiece).

The Generals won their opener
against Methodist by placing livc
players in double figures, led by
Casey's career-high 20 points, and
getting strong play from the bench
for a 102-88 season-opening win.

Every W&L player who played
contributed in his own way. And it
was a good thing, because Jacobs had
his worst game in two years. Draw-
ing double and triple teams all night
long, struggled through a four-of-17
shooting night.

But the rest of the team was there
to pick up the slack. Casey led the
way, but it was the play of Hatﬁeld
that carried the Generals to victory.
The junior power forward feasted off
all the attention that Jacobs attracted,
pouring in 17 points and snaring 14 —
rebounds.

Jacobs and Hatﬁeld represented A
W&L on the All-Toumamcnt team,
and Hatfield walked away with MVP
honors.

The Generals, 3-1, 1-0, will put
their l7-game home winning streak
on the line against conference favorite
Randolph-Macon. The Yellow Jackets .
are ranked No. 3 in the NCAA 1
Division III pre-season poll. '

Wanted: a large and
loud W&L hoops crowd

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

 

This is a public service armouncement on behalf of the Washington and
Lee basketball team.

Tonight the Generals will play host to Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference preseason favorite Randolph-Macon. The Yellow Jackets are
ranked No. 3 in the nation and have just stepped down from Division II,
where they ﬁnished last season 22-5 and ranked in the top 20.

The Yellow Jackets are 3-0 on the season and are outscoring their op-
ponents by over 20 points a game. They are led by 69" Pat Holland,
who played his freshman year at the University of Maryland. Holland
averages 18.7 points and 6.0 rebounds a game while shooting 75 percent
from the ﬁeld.

Other leaders for R-MC include 6’4” guard David Kagey, averaging
16.7 points and 4.7 rebounds a contest and Jeff Skop, a 6’6” forward
is also averaging in double ﬁgures at 11.7 points a game.

Said Generals head coach Verne Canﬁeld, “They are probably the
most sound team we have played in a while. They will try to take things
away from us, and no other team has done that. They are very tough.
As a team, they are shooting 63 percent from the ﬁeld.”

The Generals will look to push the tempo against a Randolph-Macon
team that likes to pass the ball and take their time. The key will be
junior center Chris Jacobs’ ability to run the floor. “If Chris can run the
floor and we can get him the ball, he will be able to get Holland tired
and put a couple of fouls on him that he didn't count on having,” said
Canﬁeld.

Jacobs leads the Generals in scoring at 21 points a game. He also
averages 8.5 rebounds a contest. All ﬁve Generals who start average in
double ﬁgures, and all are juniors. Ed Hart (15.0, 6.8) is second on the
team, followed by Craig Hatfield (13.8, 11.8), captain Mike Holton (11.0,
4.0) and Jim Casey (10.0, 3.0 assists).

“Randolph-Macon will play man-to-man defense for most of the game,
but they sag a bit,” said Canﬁeld. “It will be up to Michael [Holton] to
establish the three-point shot and it will be important for Edward [Hart]
to look for his shot aggressively."

One thing that will make a difference tonight is fan support. The game
is being played in the Warner Center, and everyone knows where that is.
The Generals have not lost at home in over two years, and crowd support

' has had a lot to do with that.

The home court advantage is the one thing that is a constant in college
basketball, and tonight, in what should be a very well played game, a
good crowd could mean a few more points for the home team. “That’s
what the home crowd is all about,” says Canﬁeld. “The home crowd can
set the tone right away, not only for the game but for the ofﬁcials as
well. These players have worked awfully hard, and I’d like to see a big
crowd tonight for them, to show them that what they do is appreciated.
I know everyone has work to do, but if you can get over here for a hour
or an hour and a half, the players would really appreciate it.”

Tip-off is 7:30. Wouldn’t you all like to see Jacobs cap another win
with a dunk.

Dual meets bring bright W&

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

After soundly defeating their foes
to open the season, the Washington
and Lee men’s and women's swim-
ming teams hosted the unique W&L
Dual Meet Invitational and earned
three more victories as two swimmers
qualiﬁed for nationals.

During the weekend of Nov. 17-
19, the Generals competed in four
dual meets in three days, with the
men defeating Johns Hopkins twice
(106-77 and 112-87) and splitting a
pair of meets with Ithaca (108-78 and
100-104). The women lost to Trenton,
State 115-71, Ithaca 119-67 and
Johns Hopkins 115-83.

The Invitational, a team oriented
meet, had a different type of format
than a typical swimming meet.

“There was a sprint format and a
distance format,” said W&L head
coach Page Remillard. “It was a
coaching kind of meet and a good
meet for the athletes.”

Before the season began Rernillard
had said that the men’s team would
like to send eight swimmers to na-
tionals. During the Invitational two

of the tcam’s swimmers, senior Dave
Olson and sophomore Jay Smith,
posted ﬁve national qualifying times.

Olson, the defending NCAA Div-
ision III champion in the 200-yard
backstroke, qualiﬁed for nationals in
the 100 back, 200 back and the 200
individual medley. Smith, a 1989
honorable mention Division III All-
American in the 100 free and an
academic All-American, qualiﬁed in
both the 100 and 50-yard freestyle
events.

However, Olson and Smith were
not the only standouts for the Gen-
erals. '

“Both Doug Brown and Chip
Nordhoff had a super weekend for
the men," Remillard said.

The two sophomores swam to 11
ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes. Brown earned the
top spot in the 500-yard freestyle
four times and won the 100 ﬂy once.
Nordhoff collected four victories in
the 200 free and ﬁnished ﬁrst one
time apiece in the 100 back and the
100 free.

On the women’s side, although
the scores did not indicate wins,
Remillard was pleased with the per-
formances. “We had some super

It’s tough to get noticed when
you play beside an All-American,
and when you play with an All-
American, the tendency is to let
down a bit and let the All-Amer-
ican do all the work.

Junior Craig Hatﬁeld didn’t
get much recognition last season
playing next to Honorable Men-
tion All-American Chris Jacobs as
the Washington and Lee basket-
ball team reached the Old Dom-
inion Athletic Conference tourna-
ment. Hatﬁeld could have been
satisﬁed in letting Jacobs do most
of the work and just sit back and
watch.

[_I£'HLETE-OF-THE-MONTH

   

Cralg Hatfield

The 6’4” junior from Fal-
lston, Md. has been a double-
ﬁgure scorer in every game this
year with 17, 12, 15, and 11 for
an average of 13.8. Where Hat-
ﬁeld has excelled has been on the
glass, where he leads the ODAC
with an average of 11.8. Against
Emory, Hatﬁeld snared 16 re-
bounds. For his efforts, he has
been named The Ring-tum Phi’s
Athlete-of-the-Month for Novem-

ber.
Said Generals head coach

Verne Canﬁeld, “Craig is the one
player on our team right now who
is overachieving. Craig epitomizes
every trait a coach wants in all
his athletes.”

Hatﬁeld is best known on the
team for his role as the enforcer.
He fouled out of eight games last

season, but has stayed away from
foul trouble this year, and his
numbers have shown how produc-
tive he can be.

Said Hatﬁeld, “I knew I need-
ed to get some foul discipline.
I’m going to commit fouls, and
that happens when you play a

physical game, but what I had to
cut down on was the cheap reach-
in fouls, and so far I’ve done that
pretty well.”

“Craig brings a lot of pride to
the team,” said Canﬁeld. “He is
the ﬁrst guy to react when our
noses are being rubbed in it, so
to speak. He’s the one that usual-
ly says something about it.”

Congratulations to Craig Hat-
field, The Ring-tum Phi’s Athlete-
of—the-Month for November.

I

I suppose that the general public,
myself included, is somewhat respon-
oi sible for an unsatisfactory movie like
“Back to the Future Pan II."

We become quite fond of certain
, characters, and we demand to know
what happens to our old friends after
the final credits stop rolling. The
‘ rest of the blame falls on the Holly-

‘wood producers who recognize this
4 desire and quickly capitalize upon it.

The result: senior citizens ﬂying
_tlie starship Enterprise, Jason having
I more comebacks than Sugar Ray
v‘Leonard, “Jaws” appearing in 3-D,

Arthur falling off the wagon, and
, James Bond moving closer to his
~ secret agent retirement pension.

There is only one problem: with

, a very few exceptions, the sequels are

sloppily done and are a complete

4 disappointment. We are reunited with

those familiar faces, but the producers

seem to forget that a good plot is
1 also needed.

One begins to think that Holly-
wood’s only purpose is to parade
1 these characters across the screen and

cash in on the public’s blind nostal-
' gia.

,, ' As I said, there are some notc-

  iW&LlFE
§‘Back to the Future ll’: rent the original

“Lethal Weapon II” was a superb
sequel. And some of the earlier
Bond films managed to remain fresh.
I wish this were the case for “Back
to the Future Part II.”

One gets the feeling that Holly-
wood counts on our love of certain
characters blinding us to the fact that
the storyline stinks.

“Back to the Future Part H” was
an utter disappointment. I loved
“Back to the Future,” and it remains
one of my favorite movies. And,
sure, I was anxious to be reunited
with Doc Brown, Marty McF1y, and
the souped-up DeLorean. But I'd
rather rent the first movie than sit
through this sorry excuse for a se-
quel. And, to add insult to injury,
executive producer Steven Spielberg
has banked on the moviegoer’s love
of the original movie and has AL-
READY ﬁlmed “Back to the Future
Part III.”

The blame does not lie with the
actors. Michael J. Fox (“Teen Wo-
lf,” “The Secret of My Success")
reprises his role as Marty McFly. He
does a good job of not only playing
the young Marty, but also the aging
failure that Marty has become in
2015.

Christopher Lloyd (“Star Trek
II,” “The Dream Team”) also re-
ttuns as the wildly eccentric Doc

The Ring-tum Phl, November 30, 1989

since the early dgys__of “Taxi," and

I think he is one of Hollywood's
most under-rated comic actors. Shal-
low performers like Tony Danza get
all the attention, while Lloyd quietly
turns out one memorable character
after another.

If you don't agree with me, then
simply watch Lloyd’s face during the
movie. He can do more with a
twitch of an eyebrow than most ac-
tors accomplish in an entire scene.

Lea Thompson is again cast as
Marty McFly’s mother. Although her
part is smaller in the sequel, Thomp-
son does a nice job under the various
layers of latex that her role demands.

Crispin Glover, one of Holly-
wood’s alleged bad boys, unfortunate-
ly did not decide to return as the
universal wimp George McFly. The
role is reduced to almost nothing, and
the producers use either doubles in
over-the-shoulder shots, or old scenes
from the first movie, to fill the void
left by Glover. I was disappointed,
Glover was perfectly cast in the
original film.

Finally, Thomas F. Wilson returns
as the bully Biff. Wilson’s role was
considerably expanded from the first
movie as Biff now plays a central
role in the plot. Another movie critic
summed up Wilson's contribution to
the film more eloquently than I could

eye-popping loudmouth is like getting
sprayed in the face with a garden
hose for 90 minutes.” ‘

Wilson has only two kinds of
acting techniques in his dramatic
repertoire: loud, and really loud. I
am probably being too harsh since
the role is truly one-dimensional, but
Wilson’s spastic performance almost
makes one dizzy.

The sequel begins immediately
where the first movie ended: Doc
Brown returns to 1985 and takes
Marty and his girlfriend to the year
2015. Marty’s son is in danger of
being thrown into prison, and Doc
needs Marty’s assistance in stopping
the crime. Of course the plot grows
dramatically more complex as the
2015's version of Biff, by now a
bitter, spastic old man, steals the
De.Lorean and returns to the year
1955.

The old Biff takes a sport’s alma-
nac to the 1955 Biff. This bool-;
allows the young Biff to gamble
successfully on every sporting event
for the next 45 years. He becomes a
millionaire and, in the process, alters
the future. When Doc Brown and
Marty return from 2015 to 1985, they
discover that Hill Valley has become
a gothic version of Las Vegas. So
they must once again travel to 1955,

Rush’s Presto works a little magic

By Andrew Keller
Staff Reporter

It’s been approximately two years since Rush
has put out a studio album, and about five since

they've released anything capable of their old‘

fan’s acceptance. However with their sixteenth
and newest album, Presto, it seems their new label
and producer, Atlantic and Rupert Hine respec-
tively, have worked a little magic of their own.
The sounds on this latest work should pleasantly
surprise some of Rush’s older fans.

During the two years after “Hold Your Fire,”
“A Show of Hands,” their live album was re-
leased. It seems they used the extra time to
rethink their direction.

While this album does contain tidbits of “Hold
Your Fire,” it has equal proportions of some of
their older recordings: “Farewell To Kings,”
“Moving Pictures,” and “Power Windows.”

The first ti'ack “Show Don't Tell” is a good
example of their change in direction. Alex Life-
son, the band's guitarist, seems to have plugged
his old Marshalls back in for this one, which is

nity experience.

dignity.

easily one of the best they've written in a while.
The tune, perhaps best described as some sort of
neo-techno-funk-rock, serves as a showplace for
the diverse songwriting Rush has proven them-
selves capable of.

The title track, is an equally refreshing song in
that it's the first time since “Farewell to Kings"
that acoustic guitar has assumed a real role. It's
presentation on this track is extremely reminiscent
of “Cinderella Man,” and shows Lifeson taking
a renewed interest in basic rhythm guitar.

The whole album is in fact very rhythmic
which is mainly attributed to the other two thirds
of Rush, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart. Peart, several
time winner of “best rock drummer,” shows his
ability to tastefully pick beats on “Scars.” He
artistically colors this song with abnormally long
bass drum and african style bongos to achieve his
desired effect. Throughout the album he also does
a nice job pounding out odd time signatures which
Rush makes sound so easy.

Geddy Lee completes the rhythm section with
his mix-it-up bass style. Whether he's pumping or
slapping, his bass, he's definitely one of the best
in the business. Check out his semi-bass solo on

playing on “Scars."

Lee who also plays keyboards and sings, seems
to have stepped back, although not to far, from his
keyboard and stepped up to the microphone. This
is by far his finest vocal effort to date. On
"Available Light” you’ll cringe as he, unstrained,
hits undrearned of notes.

Lee however does not write the words he
sings. The insightful and poetic lyrics which have
become a mainstay in Rush’s music are Neil
Peait’s creation. The inner sleeve of the disc is
more like a collection of poems as Peart, who
holds a graduate degree in English, touches on
many themes. '

Peart also deals with suicide in “The Pass,”
the most sensitive song on the record. In it he
offers hope to those who feel they’ve hit bottom.

Additional themes are our own unknowing
destruction of the world and the control advertis-
ing and other unreal representations of life have
on us. In short, the album gets pretty deep at
times. .

All in all it's a great album whether you're an
old or new Rush fan.

sport’s almanac. Confused?

The second half of the movie
takes place in 1955, and that is when
I began to feel cheated.

The movie producers spent endless
months recreating the movie sets used
in “Back to the Future.” They have
lovingly re-constructed the 1955 Hill
Valley that appeared in the first mov-
ie.

My complaint: not only do they
copy the original sets, but they also
seem to have copied the original
script. We are exposed to the same
situations and, at times, the EXACT
same dialogue that were featured in
the first movie. ()nc gets a strong
sense of deja-vu as all—too—familiar
scenes unfold on the screen. I didn't
pay to see a sequel that clumsily
mimics the original ﬁlm.

I am being a bit unfair, the movie
does have some original moments.
As in the first movie, the special
effects are superb — especially when
Doc and Marty travel to 2015. Your
Saab will never seem quite as sporty
after you see the cars of the 21st
century.

And the 2015 sccncs features all
the clever but subtle details that made
the first movie such a hit: a movie
billboard advertises “Jaws 9," skate-
boards no longer have wheels, and
Goldie Wilson's family is still promi-
nent in Hill Valley. But special ef-

fects and witty details cannot save a
movie.

If you are a big fan of Michael J.
Fox, or if-you are dying to see what
happened to the “Back to the Fu-
ture” gang, then do see this film.
Just don't be too disappointed. And
don't be surprised when the film ends
and there are no neat answcrs--rc-
member that the producers are ex-
pecting you to spend thosc dollars in
the summer of 1990.

Ironically, the two minutes of
highlights from “Back to the Ftiturc
Part III” looked more interesting then
the tired sequel that I sat through.
Doc Brown suffers a mishap and is
1885, while Marty is trapped in the
year 1955. Have you ever seen a
DeLorcan pulled by a team of eight
horses?

I cannot pretend to be too indig-
nant, most likely I will be one of the
first to buy a ticket for the third
movie. But this sequel was an utter
disappointment.

Peppers will give it a grade of
“C—/D+." If you want to see Marty
McFly and Doc Brown as you fondly
remember them, then go down to the
video store and rent the original. It
is much more entertaining.

“Back to the Future Part II’' is

Try Lexington for Christmas

By Tracey Thornblade
Staff Reporter

With final exams fast approaching,
many students may take a “Bah,
hurnbug” attitude toward the Christ-
mas season. But every year the
W&L community, as well as the
town of Lexington, sponsors many
events to help put students in the
Christmas Spirit. This year is no
exception.

In the next few weeks there is
something going on for everyone,
and attending one or more of the
events is practically guaranteed to
calm the frazzled student.

This Friday the Student Activi-
ties Board is sponsoring The New
Potato Caboose at the student pavil-
ion. The versatile Washington,
D.C.-based band will play music
which ranges from American rock
to jazz, folk, funk, and reggae. The
doors will open at 8 p.m. and the
show will begin at 9.

Tickets are $4 in advance and
$5 at the door.

*On Tuesday, Dec. 5, at 8 p.m.,
the W&L music division will pres-
ent its annual winter concert in Lee
Chapel. The concert will feature
selections performed by the W&L
wind ensemble, the University Cho-
rus, and the University-Rockbridge
Symphony Orchestra.

*On Wednesday, Dec. 6, Evans
Dining Hall will serve its annual
Christmas buffet dinner. The menu
will feature steamed ocean shrimp,
steamship round of beef, Smithfield
Ham, and Southern fried chicken.
Seasonal salads, desserts, and yule-

more students to attend, and they
will decorate the dining hall with
Christmas lights, ice carving, and
other decorations.

there will be a tree-lighting party in
front of President Wilson’s house.
All students are invited to come and
sing carols as the tree is lit. Re-
freshments will be served.

If these activities are not enough
to get students in the holiday spirit,
there are many other activities going
on in and around Lexington as well.

This year the city of Lexington
is sponsoring a variety of events.
Their annual Christmas promotional
theme is “Merry Lexington,” and

ﬁfty downtown businesses are par-
ticipating by holding open houses in
their stores. Approximately two
businesses a day will serve refresh-
ments to their customers and pro-
vide them with holiday recipes to
aid them in their Christmas prepara-
tions.

On Saturday, Lexington will hold
its annual Christmas Parade through
the city at 10 a.m. There will be
prizes for floats and bands.

From 12-5 that afternoon, the
Downtown Development Association
will sponsor an historic holiday tour
of Lexington featuring stops at the
W&L alumni house and Reeves
Center, the George C. Marshall Mu-
seum at VMI, the Campbell House,
Sigma Nu National Fraternity Head-
quarters, and Momingside, the Sig-
ma Nu educational center.

Club Concert will perform in the
courtyard of the old barracks at 7:-

*Friday, Dec. 1, the Rockbridge
Chorus will hold its annual carol
sing at VMI’s Jackson Hall.

ries.

banks and can be used at any of the
forty-five participating stores in
town. The Lexington Cable Compa-
ny has also done its part to make

byterian Church and The Rockbridge
Library.

Works Department, any many other
groups have also strung lights thro-

Senior confesses
in hit-and-run case

Anonymous tip leads police to Blake Comer

By Genienne Mongno
Associate Editor

Washington and Lee senior Charles B.
“Blal<e" Comer has admitted to police that he
drove the ear involved in the March l6 hit—
and—run death of freshman Mary Ashley Scar—
borough.

Comer, 21, was arrested Thursday and
charged with hit—and—run and involuntary
manslaughter. He withdrew from school Sun-
day night, according to W&L Communications
Director Brian Shaw.

Lexington Police Officer Jerry R. Knick
said a tip received Wednesday from an uniden—
tified W&L graduate led to Comer’s arrest.

According to Knick, the informant told
police Comer was driving a metallic blue
Honda Accord belonging to his parents on the
night of the accident. He said also the car
could be found at the Comer’s home in Green-
ville, S.C.

Police said the caller showed little interest
in the Sl0,000 reward offered by Scar-
borough’s parents for information concerning
the incident.

Comer told police Thursday he was behind

the wheel of the car when it hit Scarborough.
He said he did not stop because he was “sca—
red to death and didn’t know what to do."

Police said they think Comer tried to cover
up evidence of the accident by taking the car
to the Washington area to replace the wind‘
shield, which had been cracked. The car was
then returned to South Carolina, police said.

The car’s horn cover was found at the
scene of the accident. This and other debris,
including paint chips, led police to determine
that the car was an ‘86 or ‘87 metallic blue
Honda Accord.

During the eight—month investigation, police
checked all the Accords registered to W&L
students and local residents.

Police said Comer was eliminated as a sus-
pect early in the investigation because police
found no damage on his car, a dark blue ‘87
Accord.

One of Comer’s brothers had driven up to

Lexington in the parents’ metal“: blue car the
week Scarborough was killed.

Thursday afternoon, police notified Assis»
tant Dean of Students Kenneth Ruscio that
they suspected Comer.

After police obtained permission from uni-
versity officials to question Comer on campus,
Assistant Dean of Students Kenneth Ruscio
located Comer in the Commerce School, where
he was in class.

Ruscio took Comer to the Dean of Stu—
dents’ office, where he met with Lexington
Police Chief Bruce Beard. The meeting was
continued at police headquarters, and Comer
was arrested there.

Ruscio said Comer was extremely coopera-
tive in the meeting with Beard.

Knick said Comer’s parents, Braxton and
Charlene Comer, were stunned when officers
showed up at their home Thursday with a
warrant for the car.

“Naturally they were upset, kind ..~; It‘.
disbelief,” he said.

At Comer’s fraternity, Phi Delta Theta,
chapter President Warren Holland said, “at the
house there is an attitude of disbelief and
shock. The tragedy is obvious. We plan to give
Blake as much support as we can and stay
together as a house.”

Comer was released from custody Friday
after his parents posted the $50,000 bond
through a bondsman. He was allowed to return
to Greenville with his parents.

A preliminary hearing in the Lexington
General District Court is tentatively set for
Dec. 26.

If convicted, Comer could be sentenced to
up to five years in prison for hit—and—run and
10 years for involuntary manslaughter.

Because Comer has withdrawn from school
but has not yet been convicted of any crime,
he will remain a student in good standing

regardless of the outcome of the case, Shaw
said.

Beard said there could be more arrests if
investigators determine that there were passen-
gers in Comer’s car at the time of the aeci»
dent.

He also said anyone who learned about the
accident but concealed information about it
could be charged as an accessory after the fact
or with aiding and abetting a crime.

Knick said the police will continue to
investigate even if no one besides Comer was
involved.

Comer’s parents have hired Lexington
lawyer Thomas Spencer to represent their son.

“He and his parents are distraught not only
for themselves but for the woman [Scarbor-
ough] and her parents," said Spencer. “What
can you do? How can you make things right
under the circumstances, if hc’s guilty?”

Last tip just jailhouse talk

By Gregory Euston
Editor

The story about possible suspects
in the Scarborough case that was
printed in The Ring-tum Phi Thursday
was not fabricated by police, said
Lexington Police Chief Bruce M.
Beard.

“It ended up being just jailhouse
talk,” said Beard, “but we had to
check it out as fact."

According to Lexington Police
Officer Jerry Knick, he had been
working on the tip from an inmate at
the state penitcntary in Richmond
about a month before he contacted
The Phi.

Knick told reporter Nick Thomp-
son that, according to the tip, diree
black males robbed a white male

about 5~foot—S inches tall in the East
Nelson Street area about three min-
utes before Scarborough was killed.

The tip further said the robbers
fled on foor to a car similar to the
suspected vehicle. The car is said to
have fled the area at a high rate of
speed.

The alleged robbery of $250, a
wallet and a gold chain was never
reported.

Lexington police contacted The
Phi because they had been unable to
identify the robbery victim, according
to Beard.

“The accident took place on a
party night,” said Beard, and since a
lot of students are out on a Wednes-
day night, the police believed a stu-
dent may have been the victim of the
robbery.

“He gave us a good song and

dance, said Beard of the Richmond
informant. Beard siad they have
received several similar tips from
convicts, none of which had looked
as promising.

Knick said the tip looked promis-
ing because the source was able to
describe areas in Lexington and knew
details about the accident.

“I don’t know what kind of mo-
tive [the infonnant] had,” said Beard,
“but inmates are always looking for
a bargain.”

Often, said Beard, inmates will
attempt to help are always looking
for a bargain.”

The tip that resulted in the arrest
of W&L senior Charles B. “Blake”
Comer was not received until 11 a.m.
Wednesday morning, after which the
case's “pieces went together like a
puzzle," said Beard.

Pretrial
set for
Comer

By Gregory Euston
Editor

Charles B. “Blake" Comer will
appear before Judge Joseph Hess at
a preliminary hearing in Lexington
General District Court on Jan. 30.

Based on evidence presented at
the hearing, the Rockbridge County
grand jury will consider indictments
against Comer for hit-and—run and
involuntary manslaughter charges.

Comer, 21, was arrested last Nov.
31 and charged with the March 16
hit-and-run manslaughter of Washing-
ton and Lee freshman Mary Ashley
Scarborough.

A senior history major, Comer
withdrew from W&L the Sunday
following his Thursday arrest.

Lexington Police were led to
Comer by an anonymous informant
who is a recent W&L graduate.

The informant told police that
Comer was responsible for the acci-
dent and that the car could be found
at the Comer home in Greenville,

S.C.
Comer told police he was driving

the car the night of the accident.
Comer said he did not stop because
he was “scared to death and didn’t
know what to do.”

According to Lexington ‘Police
Chief Bruce M. Beard police continue
to investigate the possibility of ac-
complices.

Since December, the informant
has not called back with any more
tips or shown any interest in the

of Scarborough.

32 dropped from W&L chapter

By Joel Smith
Staff Reporter

Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity’s national Su-
preme Council suspended the operations of its
chapter at Washington and Lee and has taken
action to re-establish the chapter as a result of
violations of the fratemity’s membership stan-
dards, said a statement released Tuesday by
Professor Roger Dean, the chapter’s advisor.

As a result of the action, 32 members were
not invited back to re-establish the chapter.

The supreme council suspended PiKA’s
operations on November 27 and launched an
investigation into possible violations of the
national fratemity’s “Standards for Retention of
Membership, Officer Status and Chapter Charter
in Good Standing,” which includes regulations
regarding alcohol and drugs, hazing, sexual
abuse and education.

Each undergraduate member of the chapter
was placed on “early alumni status,” which is
similar to a chapter membership suspension.
The fratemity’s national staff then conducted a
formal assessment of the chapter’s 62 indi-
vidual members. Each willing member was
interviewed by two different PiKA staff mem-
bers.

Following the interviews, the Supreme
Council invited thirty members to resume under-
graduate status and “to assist in rebuilding the
chapter," the statement said. PiKA’s other 32
members will remain on early alumni status,
which prohibits their presence on PiKA property

grades

onthe upswing  

 

By Chuck Broil
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee's fraternities
are improving on their grades and
expanding on their social service
projects, the W&L Interfraternity
Council was told Tuesday night.

The all-fraternity grade-point
average for fall term was 2.729, up
from last winter term’s 2.714,
according to the Registrar’s Office.
The non-fraternity average dipped
from last winter’s mark of 2.884 to
2.763, and the all-male category
declined from 2.478 to 2.736 since
last winter term.

“I was very pleased that the all-
male and the all— fraternity averages
were so close," IFC President Kevin
Nash said. “We’re striving to boost
all the fraternity-average above the
all-males.”

Also up from last term is the
lowest fratemity’s average. Beta
Theta Pi’s fall term average of 2.606
beats the lowest average from last
winter’s grades, a 2.581 from Sigma
Phi Epsilon.

Nash also released a list of social
service projects taken on by
fraternities over the past term. The
incomplete list includes painting the
Rockbridge Area Recreational
Organization building by members of

The thirty now—active members were invited

back because they “showed a commitment to
break cleanly with past philosophies and nega-
tive traditions so that the W&L chapter can start
with a clean foundation,” the statement said.

“No one individual has been accused of
any wrongdoing,” said Dean. “This has been a
very painful process for all involved. But I sup-
port the supreme council’s stance regarding zero
tolerance for drug abuse, hazing, vandalism and
ungentlemanly behavior. It is a fact of life that
the behavior of a few irresponsible men can
place the whole fraternity in jeopardy,” Dean
said.

Although none of the 32 members placed
on early alumni status were accused of any
specific wrongdoing, “the staff believed that
those members could not, or were not, willing
to contribute to the degree necessary to effect a
positive environment and a better way of life at
the chapter,” the statement said.

In a letter to the members of the chapter,
Raymond L. Orians, the fratemity’s national
executive vice president, said “we experienced
a general lack of commitment from a majority
of the members to hold each other accountable
and especially to aspire to those principles and
values of our fratemity.”'

The Supreme Council also appointed new
officers for the re-established chapter. John
Thorsen was named president, Richard Perry,
vice president; Darren Braccia, secretary; and
Michael Danzansky, treasurer. The four new
officers, along with Dean, attended the fratemit-
y’s armual President's Conference in Memphis
last week.

Scott Russell, the chapter’s national consul-
tant, will be in Lexington until Friday to over-
see the chapter’s re-organization.

EC votes for activities fee

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

The Executive Committee ap-
proved a $15 increase in the student
activities fee Monday in an effort to
prepare a proposal for the upcoming
Board of Trustees’ meeting.

According to EC President Wil-
lard Dumas, last year’s grant of about
$16,000 from President John Wilson's
contingency fund came on the condi-
tion that the EC consider a student
activities fee increase. However, the
EC reports rising costs and an in-
creased demand for funding of stu-
dent organizations as the primary

motivations for the change.

“The student body needs this
money,” said Dumas, who added that
he has “no fond memories” of this
year’s budget allocation hearings.
“It’s an attempt to deal with the
cosH>f-living increase and inﬂation.”

The $15 increase would raise next
year’s student activities fee from

the pavilion, according to EC Vice-
President Jon Sheinberg. The motion
passed with three dissenting votes:
Freshman EC Rep. Sean Gatewood
and Junior EC Reps. John Fialcowitz
and Thompson Hatcher.

The EC must pass the motion

again next week before it is referred
to the Board of Trustees for approval.

Gatewood expressed concern that
the increase would generate a surplus
in EC funds, but Dumas said that
would not necessarily occur consider-
ing the demand by student organiza-
tions for funding.

“There is no desire by myself or
members of the committee to create
a surplus,” said Dumas.

Dumas said that student organiza-
tions are still waiting to hear from
the EC on $3,500 in funding re-
quests, including more than $1,500
for the Political Review and more
than $1,200 for the Calyx. Requests

same, said Dumas. The Student Ac-
tivities Board, for example, received
$6,000 less than last year, according
to Dumas, “however, they're still
having to book bands at 1989-90
prices."

Fialcowitz and Hatchet favored a
more moderate increase, perhaps of
$10.

Dean of Students Lewis John
expressed support for the increase in
the fee, noting that it has been two
years since the last increase. John
added that the Board of Trustees has
not discussed “specific dollar

W&L, MSA celebrate King’s ‘dream’

By Pat Lopes
Staff Reporter

And when we allow freedom to ring, when we
let it ring from every village and hamlet, from every
state and city, we will be able to speed up that day
when all of God's children-black men and white
men, Jews and Gentiles, Catholics and Protestants-
will be able to join hands and to sing in the words
of the old Negro spiritual, ‘Free at last, free at
last; thank God Almighty, we are free at last.’

More than 20 years after the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. described his dream for America,
the third Monday in January was proclaimed
Martin Luther King Jr. Day, in memory of the man
who led the civil rights movement for blacks
during the 1950s and 1960s.

Here at Washington and Lee, the Minority
Students Association is celebrating King’s birthday
with a number of events, all of them open to the
public.

“We’re trying to extend the celebration this
year,” said MSA President James Rambeau. This
is the fifth year the MSA has coordinated events in
memory of King. According to Rambeau, atten
dance at the events has increased steadily.

King remembered

Washington and Lee organizations are
sponsoring the following events as part of
Martin Luther King Jr. Day:

Monday — “Reflections of the Dream"
at 8 p.m. in Lexington's First Baptist
Church, Main and Henry streets.

Wednesday - Memorial Service and
Lecture: “Non-violent Social Change" by
Prof. Jarvis Hall.

Jan. 23 — Lecture on the significance of
King in Virginia politics by Roanoke Mayor
Noel C. Taylor.

“More white folks are recognizing the inﬂuence
of Martin Luther King and his signiﬁcance to
American society,” Rambeau said. “Attendance
has been great.”

In the last few years, Rambeau said the crowd
has been an even mixture of blacks and whites.
Rambeau attributed the increasing attendance of
white students and local residents to the increasing
integration of blacks into extracurricular and town

activities.

This year’s events begin Monday, which is
Martin Luther King Jr. Day. At 8 p.rn., W&L
undergraduates, law students and cadets from the
Virginia Military Academy will speak on “What
‘The Dream’ Means to Me” at the First Baptist
Church. The church is at 103 North Main St., at
the comer of Main and Henry streets.

W&L’s first Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial
Lecture will be delivered by Visiting Professor of
Politics Jarvis Hall at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan.
17 at Lee Chapel. The lecture is jointly sponsored
by the MSA and the Lexington Area Ministerial
Association. They hope to make the lecture an
annual event.

Following the lecture, there will be a reception
at the Morris House.

Roanoke Mayor Noel C. Taylor will wrap-up
the events on Tuesday. He will be talking about
King’s signiﬁcance to Virginia politics at 4:30 p.m.
in the University Library’s Northen Auditorium.

Monday’s classes will run on schedule here at
W&L, although that day is a federal holiday. The
post office will be closed, and there will be no
mail delivery. Although some states have also

Virginia government offices will be open.

Spence said he believes the bur-

glaries are connected and were done
by professionals. They took mostly
jewelry and money, he said.

“They know what they’re doing
and they're continually doing it,”
Spence said. “They got students
because they knew they were home

Because of the professional nature
of the burglaries, Spence said there
is very little the students could have
done to prevent them aside from
installing alarm systems or participat-
ing in a neighborhood watch.

OPINION
THE Game

Tonight at 7:30, the Washington and Lee basketball
team will play what coach Verne Canﬁeld, like most
coaches, would probably call just another conference
game. “All our games are big,” he might say. “We just
take ‘em one at a time.”

Well, maybe Canﬁeld and his players do see it that
way, but W&L fans certainly don’t. For whatever reason,
the Generals’ annual home contest against Roanoke
College has become, as far as most students are
concerned, THE game of the season.

Attendance tonight is likely to be a season-high for the

 

halftime illustrates, but you wouldn’t think so from what
will go on tonight. We expect that, as usual, things will
get a little out of hand, as W&L students transform the
Warner Center into their own version of Duke’s infamous
Cameron Indoor Stadium. For freshmen in particular,
tonight’s game will be an experience, to say the least.

Though we don’t have any inside information, it seems
a safe bet that the “Unknown Fans” — Canﬁeld once
called them “the guys with the bags” — will be on hand,
as well as enough more typically-dressed W&L students
to nearly ﬁll the east stands at the Warner Center.

The show on the court should also be particularly
entertaining. W&L has lost ‘only one home game in its
last two seasons, and this year’s Generals boast a 7-3
record, including three wins in four games since
Christmas. The Maroons are on a three-game winnning
streak and have had a week to prepare and to think about
their three losses in three games against the Generals in
1989.

An alumnus once observed of W&L, “youth is the
keynote of the place, and though professors may protest
and chaperones may carp, youth continues to have its
ﬂing here.” That description should be particularly apt
tonight. We could complain that things shouldn’t go too
far, that we should be conscious of our self—imposed
guidelines with regard to behaving like gentlemen. But
all of that goes without saying. It seems more appropriate

_ that we ask students to preserve the enthusiasm they show
tonight for future athletic contests — basketball and
otherwise. Win or lose tonight, W&L students should
make a new year’s resolution to support their school's
athletic teams. We all know the academic demands of a
W&L education; but, as any General will tell you, the
demands of college athletic competition here at Washing-
ton and Lee are also rigorous indeed. The Generals, in all
sports, deserve more from the student body than one night
of support a year — and, besides, it beats the hell out of
studying.

By David Parker

EDITOR'S NOTE.‘ W&L History Prof. David
Parker was Blake Comer’s academic advisor. He
wrote Comer this letter on Dec. 1.

Dear Blake,

No one knows how you feel at this moment, or
how you have felt over the past eight or so
months. Life is so much more complicated than
any of us ever anticipate.

Last week the Washington and Lee community
was united in the desire to see the person
responsible for the death of Ashley Scarborough
. found and punished When rumor had it that three
lower class outsiders might have hit her as they
ﬂed the scene of an armed assault, I suspect our
vindictiveness ﬂowed unchecked. There was no
fate too awful to be wished on the likes of people
like that.

Today, the W&L community is divided between
those who know you and those who don’t. Those
who do not know you continue to feel as they did
last week. They think of you at the moment your
car hit Ashley, and they imagine a heart turned
cold with the instinct of self-preservation. They
construe your driving away from the battered
woman as evidence of beastly indifference. 7They
think of the ensuing months of silence as a time of
incomprehensible and unforgivable poise rooted in
heartlessness. They see your willingness to saddle

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

   
 
   

Blake Comer’s advisor:

‘We are still your friends’ 

your friends with either active or passive
conspiracy as proof of ruthless self-centeredness.
They can no more identify with you than they can
abandon their belief in the sanctity of human life.
For them, to have sympathy for you is to scorn
those you have harmed.

But those of us who know and care for you are
stumbling toward a new understanding of our own
judgments and values. We, too, think of you at the
moment of impact, and imagine an explosion of
panic and horror going off in your head We
imagine a blinding panic followed by a studied
effort to lessen the impact of the situation which
you could not change. We think of the ensuing
months as a living hell — a time without family,
friends or even a self you could trust. We imagine
your arrest as a great, ﬁnal sigh of relief. Without
knowing the truth, we are impelled toward the
most charitable explanations we can imagine. We
twist and we turn, trying to bring into one person
the man we are so familiar and the actions we
thought were foreign to you and us. We look at
you and we also see ourselves.

Last week. we were all united, confident of our
strength and virtue. Now, we are divided and your
friends are shaken. But his is not all bad. It was
easy to presume we were better than the unknown
guilty. party. It’ is harder to presume ourselves
better than you. We are less certain of our
incapacity to leave others to their fates. We are
less vindictive than we might otherwise have been.

Dreaming in black and white

Since we cannot bring ourselves to condenm you
with ease, we move toward forgiving others. And
since we cannot love you less, we make room to
love others more. We are less convinced of our
own strengths and more sensitive to the frailty of
others. Some of us are trying to care and forgive
at the same time when, but for you, we woul
have loathed. c

If life seems burdensome to you right now, if
death seems like a welcome relief, than you ar
indeed like the rest of us. You have no reason to
go on alone. You may think your prospects for a
fruitful life have ended — you probably thoughf
that at the moment of the accident. But in truth;
you have received a terrible gift you can choose to
use for others, just as you have tried to live’
generously during the past twenty years: you know,
better than most what it means to need and (I
hope) experience forgiveness. You now, I would’
think, have a clearer sense of what is important '
life. You can be a far better friend and counselor
than you have ever been, simply because you now
know life's tragedies in a way almost none of us
can comprehend.

You may think it is unfair to have been tested
beyond your endurance, but the test is not ye
over. Pay what is required of you to the best 0
your» ability and return to those who know you, for
we are still your friends — we are more than eve
your friends. More than ever, we need your help to
understand. ~

    
   
     
  
   
  
 
    
 

  

MY VIEW
By James Lake

I have a dream.

It is a dream deeply rooted in the
American dream that one day this
nation will rise up and live out the
true meaning of its creed — we hold
these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal.

I have a dream that one day there
will no longer be a National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored
People, nor one for White People,
nor one for Any People.

I have a dream that one day job
applications will no longer include
questions of race and gender. I have
a dream that one day employers will
not be forced to choose between
considering race and defending them-

selves in court.

I have a dream that one day race
will be irrelevant, that this nation will
someday live up to its creed - em-
ployment without regard to race,
color, creed, religion or national
origin.

I dream of a day when affirmative
action and bigotry will be recognized
as synonyms, when employers will
realize that there never can be an
“equal opportunity/affirmative action
employer,” when blacks and whites
will together understand that race is
either relevant or irrelevant.

I have a dream my four little
children will one day live in a nation
where they will not be judged by the
color of their skin but by the content
of their character.

I have a dream that schools will
someday ignore race in recruiting and
admissions, that there will someday

no longer be Minority Student Asso-
ciations, that percentages and quotas
and pre-orientations will one day be
things of the past.

I have a dream that students will
one day go to the schools of their
own choosing, that judges will not
make buses and quotas the means for
doing what parents and children
should do themselves.

I have a dream that one day race
will be irrelevant, that this nation will
someday live up to its creed — ad-
mission without regard to race, color,
creed, religion or national origin.

I dream of a day when a police
officer of one race may arrest a man
of another without fear of a lawsuit,
when all people will be concerned
about the crime itself and not the
color of the suspect.

I dream of a day when it will no
longer be news when a black man

   
    
    
   
  
    
    
  
  

does something because he is blac
when a woman will no longer b
lauded for an accomplishment simpl
because she is a woman. I have .
dream.

I have a dream that organizatio v
will someday ignore race when elect-
ing new members, and that others
will not pounce on groups that hap
pen to lack “sufficient minority rep-
resentation.” I dream of a day when
people need not resign from groups
just because others do not approve of
that group’s composition. I have a
dream.

I dream of a day when social
groups will not boast of “diversity"
as if one individual is more desire-
able than another because of the color
of his skin. I have a dream. .

If America is to be a great na-
tion, this must become true. '

I have a dream.

Panama: America’s next Vietnam?

MY VIEW
By Brian Adams

On Friday, Dec. 15, 1989, Manuel Noriega de-
clared war on the United States. The next day, an
American soldier was shot dead in Panama. In the
subsequent 72 hours, the 13,000 U.S. servicemen
already there were reinforced by an additional
7,000 troops, and a full-scale invasion was
launched. It is impossible the Panamanians did not
know we were coming, and they fought back —
successfully defending the life of their bandit
leader. Has America been duped into another
Vietnam? Will December 1989 be known as the
Panamanian Christmas like July 1968 is intema-
tionally recognized as Prague Spring?

At 9:15 a.m. Wednesday Dec. 20, 1989, seven
hours after the assault was initialized, General
Colin Powell was broadcast live over all major
U.S. television networks saying, “This operation is
almost a complete success. There are a few minor
pockets of resistance remaining. Noriega is now a
fugitive and is being treated like one. We expect
this operation to be concluded in a few hours." In
the subsequent 96 hours, an additional 6,000 troops
arrived in Panama, and the fighting continued. A
U.S. serviceman filmed on ABC News was quoted,
“The Panamanians are all friendly,” as several
GI’s around him scanned the perimeter of their
bunker, prepared to return sniper ﬁre. Included in
the same story was an estimated resistance strength
of 2,000 men and a surmisement that in order to
free some cities they will be swept, “...block by
block...” to eliminate the enemy. Apparently, a full

guerilla war against the United States could erupt
in Latin America with the Panama Canal’s vital sea
lane and many lives at stake. How long will this
threat continue? How many people will die? What
was General Powell's mistake in assuming the
largest U.S. military operation since 1974 would be
so tidy?

In June 1981, Argentina invaded the Falkland
Islands claiming dominion over Britain by rights of
a centuries-old treaty. Costa Mendez made, how-
ever, a serious miscalculation. He believed Wash-
ington would find in the conﬂict of laws between
the NATO Alliance and the Monroe Doctrine that
the latter rules. U.S. Air Force cargo planes,
however, refueled British ﬁghters over the south
Atlantic, and France cancelled all deliveries of their
deadly exocet missiles to Buenos Aries. Gurka
mercenary British troops then overwhelmed the
Argentine regulars, and the war ended with a few
battle ships lost on both sides.

If, “The Panamanians are all friendly,” then
who are the 2,000 men of the resistance? Noriega,
a former U.S. ally, is known to be a thief in the
midst of honor. Is there honor among thieves? Has
President Bush underestimated the strong man's
most dependable ally, the Columbian cocaine car-
tels. their $250 billion war chest. and their in-

ﬂuence throughout the Caribbean? It is possible
the resistance consists of Salvadorans, Sandanistas,
Cubans and Columbian—bom, Israeli—trained inter- ‘
national terrorists. If this is the case, then the,
resistance can certainly ﬁeld more than 2,000
troops. '
If the combined forces of Noriega, Ortega,
Castro, and Columbian cartels can install a new

resistance leader in Panama, or if one rises through V‘

the ranks already there, then this war may last not
only into next year, but into next century. If the “
United States begins bombing, then the psycho— p
logical war for the minds of Mayan villagers will
be lost. They value their banana groves and sugar '
cane as the Vietnamese value their rice paddies. t
A well-organized anti-American guerilla militia
exists in Latin America, whose real strength 1
exceeds 100,000 enemy troops. Some have been
battle-hardened in Angola, others are combat~ I
proven in their own neighborhoods. If the ﬁghting 5
escalates again, and we are to avoid another
prolonged and lethal catastrophe similar to the one '
we suffered 15 years ago, then we have at least
one choice. Our naval, marine, and surveillance .
capacity is adequate to assure the continued func-
tioning of the canal. In a matter of weeks we can
effectively blockade all regions containing potential
allies of the resistance. If we do this and wait long
enough, then the anti-American elements may
starve, and we may find our Caribbean dilemma
has other alternatives (like legalizing drugs). If our
current policy leads to jungle warfare, then we may
find “peace with honor" and 50,000 dead GI’s.

The Washington and Lee Panliel-

terrn and long-term sorority housing
options at a meeting Tuesday.

“We're not unmindful of the need
for the sororities to have a place to
meet," said Associate Dean of Stu-

‘ dents Leroy Atkins.

Atkins said that the university is
willing to help the sororities achieve
the type of environment they would

which will begin colonization Jan. 24,

From the W&L News Office

The Honorable Lewis F. Powell,
Jr, former justice of the United States
Supreme Court, has announced his
intention to leave his personal and
professional papers to Washington
and Lee University, his alrna mater.
The collection spans Powell's career
on the Supreme Court and his tenures
as chairman of the Richmond School
Board and president of the American
Bar Association.

The collection will be housed in
a new addition to Lewis Hall, the
W&L School of Law which is named
for Frances and Sydney Lewis of
Richmond. Construction on the addi-
tion will begin in the spring of 1990
and will be completed in approxi-
mately 18 months.

“The papers of most justices of
the Supreme Court have been left to

‘Housing questions

centrate on short-term facilities.

Assistant Dean of Students Ken-
neth P. Ruscio proposed for the inter-
im that each chapter be designated
one of the five-person loft suites in
Gaines Hall and, depending upon the
demand, would also have the ﬂoor
beneath reserved for Parihelleriic.

The dorm area would come under
either Par1lielleriic’s rules or the re-
spective sorority’s house rules, which
were also presented Tuesday.

The rules for each of the three sor-
orities are basically the same - al-
cohol is prohibited on the premises
and males are restricted from private
rooms at all times and from common
areas during designated times.

W&L’s Capital Planning Coor-

The Ring-tum Phi, January 11, 1990

dinator Frank Parsons, who works
closely with architects and engineers
as well as with the City of
Lexington, has been working with
Atkins and Ruscio on various pos-
sibilities for sorority housing..

W&L hopes to take a master plan
for fraternity and sorority expansion
to the Lexington Planning Commis-
sion Jan. 25.

“We will show in a general way
that we anticipate accommodating the
sororities in the Davidson Park area,"
Parsons said. Davidson Park is the
area that includes those fraternities
from Pi Kappa Phi to Kappa Alpha.

Parsons stressed that the univer-
sity will first need to complete the
Fraternity Renaissance program and

give papers to W&L

the Library of Congress,” said Pow-
ell. “My intention to leave my
papers at the law school at Washing-
ton and Lee is based primarily on the
plans, approved by the Board of
Trustees, to add an addition to the
law school building that will house
my papers and provide facilities for
appropriate research. Also, my six
years on the campus were among the
happiest in my life. I have a deep
and abiding affection for the college
that bears the names of George
Washington and Robert E. Lee.”
Randall P. Bezanson, dean of the
law school, said, “Justice Powell's
service on the Supreme Court
spanned a particularly crucial period
in the court’s history, and his inﬂu-
ence was widely felt as a key ﬁgure
during that period. His Supreme
Court papers and his other papers
comprise a rich and unique research
for scholars and students of the Su-

preme Court and of American judicial
and political history. This collection
will attract students and scholars from
other institutions, thereby contributing
immeasurably to the richness of the
university’s academic life.”

Powell, who received both his
undergraduate and law degrees from
W&L, was appointed to the Supreme
Court in 1971 by President Richard
M. Nixon. He served on the Su-
preme Court until his resignation in
1987.

“Justice Powell was at the center
of the national stage at a time of

profound political, societal, and juris- =~ S

prudential upheaval,” Bezanson said.
“By the force of his intellect, his
character and his experience, Justice
Powell exerted a deep and lasting
inﬂuence on this nation and its laws
and institutions.”

Powell served on the university’s
board of trustees from 1961 to 1978.

will then be able to turn its attention
to the sororities.

Parsons presented the three sor-
orities with an option of a “lodge”
in the Troubadour Theater that would
be a meeting place rather than a
residence. He said completion of the
Lenfest Center will “free up the
Troubadour Theater,” he said.

The theater would be used to
“tide the sororities over in the short-
term,” Parsons said. The theater
would be used on the basis of rota-
tion by all three sororities as well as
by certain other university groups.

The chapter consultants also pre-
sented the women with their views on
sorority houses with respect to their
own experiences.

 

Former Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.
gives his judicial papers to law
school; addition to Lewis Hall is
planned

He was awarded an honorary doctor
of laws degree from W&L in 1960.

The Board of Trustees will begin

of more than $20,000 last year direct-

ly prompted the proposed increase.
“The SAB made ...[an increase]
inevitable much sooner than was
expected," he said, but the increase
was inevitable nonetheless.

Before closing the issue, Dumas
told the EC members “to talk to the
students you represent” before next
week's vote.

In other EC business, John Harnil-
ton was appointed Fancy Dress audi-
tor before break, ﬁlling the position
vacated by Terance Fowler.

“The Executive Committee has
the utmost faith in Mr. Hamilton,"
said Dumas. “He is in full under-

Lexington Christmas parade.

Phi Kappa Sigma also sponsored
a leadership workshop Tuesday night,
at which Chapter President Brooks
Pettus discussed Phi Kap’s new
leadership, food and pledge programs
for the upcoming year. Pettus and
chapter advisor Jerry Darrell said

their fraternity is the first to have
retirement funds set up to support
current and past fraternity employees.

Also, successful food budgeting
programs were outlined at the
workshop. Last year Phi Kap saved
$31,331 in the first year of the
program, Darrell said. New ideas for
handling pledge programs were also
discussed at the workshop.

Additionally, Nash said the IFC
food drive brought in $900 worth of
food in cans. The IFC also allocated
$200 of its funds to buy more food
for the needy in the Lexington area.

Spence said the sheriff’s depart-
ment will send a crime prevention
officer to any county resident’s home
to give security tips and explain the
logistics of a neighborhood watch.

In addition, Spence said he
would advise students to leave only
necessities in their houses during
breaks and to advise their neighbors
and the sheriff’ s department of their
comings and goings.

Sophomore Denise Brainard said
she and her roommate lost $3,500
worth of jewelry and jars of pennies,

in addition to four pounds of
M&M’s — “for the road, I guess,”
she said.

Brainard said the burglars kicked in
the front door to their house, which
is near the quarry, on Route 7.

The burglars missed $400 in cash,
she said.

Brainard said her landlord had re-
cently irimstalled new locks but will
now add an alarm system.

The investigation into the crimes is
continuing, Spence said.

TALKBACK

. .. 

Mark Melton, ’92, Houston,
Texas. — “I thought they were
actually pretty good for the
United States. Reagan did some
positive things for the U.S. It was
the third decade I've lived in
since I was born in 1969, and I
actually graduated from
hi ghschool. ’ ’

Scott Bahrke, ‘90, Roseland,
NJ. — “It was a good decade.
Reagan was a great President.”

   

Kappa Alpha Theta's chapter
consultant, Anne Katzenbach, came to
W&L from a chapter where there was
a sorority house. She presented her
views on the pros and cons of a
sorority house. She emphasized that
while a house brings the chapter
closer and also gives the sorority a
place to meet, she also said that there
was a great deal of responsibility that
came along with it in the cost and
the upkeep.

Tammy Moss, Chi 0mega’s chap-
ter consultant, came from a colony
similar to those at W&L, where there
was a non-house chapter. She also
said that a house would give the
sororities a convenient meeting place
and would alleviate the current sche-

highlight Panhellenic meeting

duling problems which arise with the
use of the University Center by all
three sororities as well as other uni-
versity organizations.

Following discussion of the hous-
ing situation, Courtney Payne, Panhel-
leriic Rush Chairman, presented the
rush rules for all three sororities with
respect to their own parties as well as
outside parties.

Payne reminded the women that
they had voted last fall on these rules
such as the one prohibiting actives,
pledges and rushees from attending a
social function at a fraternity during
the week of rush. This rule further
prevents any possibility of rusher-
rushee contact outside of the sche-
duled rush parties, Payne said.

f].SPORTS

Michaels marked the ’80s
with the calls of the decade

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

I know by now that you all must be sick of reading about the best of
the 1980s, but bear with me for just one more column about the '80s
in sports. I'll try to make it just a little bit different.

The most memorable moments of 1980s were opened and closed by
a sentence and a fragment out of the mouth of the best broadcaster of
the decade.

Between 1980 and 1989, there were several memorable moments,
unbelievable plays, comeback stories and rnind-boggling upsets. In the
Olympics, the United States saw both ends of the spectrum. In 1984, Bob
Knight coached the men’s basketball team, possibly the greatest team of
amateurs ever assembled, to the gold metal in Los Angeles. Four years
later, John Thompson failed to defend‘Knight’s title, losing to the hated
Russians in the semiﬁnal round in Seoul.

The Comebacks: The two greatest comeback stories of the decade
belong to a basketball player and a biker. Steve Kerr, now a guard with
the NBA‘s Cleveland Cavaliers, played college basketball for the
University of Arizona.

His “story is two-fold. After his junior season in 1986, Kerr travelled
to Europe to play for the US in the World University Games.

As Kerr made a move to the basket, his knee snapped, and his
basketball career was doomed. But having the knee reconstructed, Kerr
redshirted the 1986--87 season and rehabilitated his knee. By 1987-88
Kerr was ready to go. His steady play helped Arizona hold down the No.
1 spot in the polls almost all season and a spot in the Final Four.

Along the way, Kerr lead the nation in three-point ﬁeld goal
percentage at nearly 60 percent. Kerr, a point guard, also turned the ball
over less than once a game in 35 starts.

Not only did Kerr have to deal with a reconstructed knee, but also
with the tragic loss of his father. Kerr’s father, a professor at the
American University in Beirut, was assassinated before the season.

During the season, Kerr was given a painful reminder of his father's
death when Arizona traveled to Tempe to play Arizona State. As Kerr
and the Wildcats came out for pregame warrnups, a number of Arizona
State students began classlessly chanting “PLO, PLO.” After being
restrained by teammates, Kerr erupted for 20 first half points on six-of-
six shooting from three-point range.

The second comeback story belongs to world class biker Greg
LeMond. The winner of the world’s most prestigious bike race, the Tour
de France, in 1986. In the beginning of 1987, LeMond was almost fatally
shot in a hunting accident. He was shot in the back and could barely
breath. Two shot-gun pellets were lodged in the lining of his heart.

Today, LeMond still has approximately 30 pellets still in his body,
including the aforementioned two. Almost miraculously, LeMond was
riding again eight weeks after being shot.

Two long years after being shot, LeMond was back in the Tour de
France. His amazing comeback to racing was capped with an even more
amazing, if that can be so, comeback to with the Tour in 1989. On the
final day, which consisted of a 24.5 kilometer time trial, LeMond trailed
the leader Laurent Fignon by 50 seconds, a deﬁcit deemed
insurmountable. The rest is history as LeMond sped to his second win
in his last two Tour de France starts.

The Play: The greatest single play of the decade should be no
surprise. On Thanksgiving weekend in 1984, two of the greatest college
quarterbacks hooked up in what might be the greatest college football
game of all time.

Doug Flutie of Boston College and Bernie Kosar of Miami passed
and passed and passed for three and a half quarters in the Orange Bowl
until Kosar ﬁnally seemed to give Miami a win. Melvin Bratton scored
with about 30 seconds left to give Miami a 42-41 lead.

Not to be outdone, Flutie quickly moved the Eagles to midfield where
he had time for one last play...one last miracle. Flutie called the now-

famous play “Flood”-tip left," sending three receivers down the ﬁeld into I '

the end zone.

As Flutie rolled out, Gerard Phelan broke behind the defense. At his
own 37-yard line, Flutie planted and threw. Somehow, the ball made its
way to Phelan, who made the catch on the ground, in the end zone.
Final score: BC 47, Miami 42.

The Sentence and the Fragment: Al Michaels had the great honor

W&L beaten at BC by one

By Jay Piotkln
Sports Editor

When a basketball team doesn’t
practice or play a game for 30 days,
spectators should expect a little slop-
piness.

Throw in foul trouble, an injury,
and an ejection, and you can figure
out the rest.

That’s how the Washington and
Lee basketball team rang in the new
year. “After four days of good prac-
tices, I was totally dissatisﬁed with
the way we played tonight,” said
W&L head coach Verne Canﬁeld
after his Generals defeated Clarkson
85-63 in the opening round of the
21st armual W&L/Bank of Rock-
bridge Invitational Tournament.

The signs of rustiness were there.
The team shot 38.3 percent from the
ﬁeld and hit just 67.4 percent from
the foul line. The two teams com-
bined for 46 turnovers, 63 fouls and
86 total free throws. Clarkson shot
just 36.4 percent from the ﬁeld.

The Generals started slowly, but
held Clarkson scoreless for the last
6:30 of the first half and first 3:30 of
the second half to take a lead by as
many as 21 points. The Generals
were led in scoring by junior center
Chris Jacobs, who turned in his best
performance of the season to date. He
had 17 ﬁrst half points en route to
his second 30-plus scoring output of
the season ﬁnishing with 32.

Generals

The Washington and Lee wrestling
squad dives into the heart of its sea-
son this weekend when it travels to
Davidson, N.C. for the Davidson Tri-
angular.

After a long Christmas break and
a month long lay—off from competi-
tion, Generals head coach Gary
Franke hopes his injury-free, mentally
rested club is ready for this upcoming
triangular meet.

From now until February break,
the Generals will compete every week
and now is the key point to their
season. Said Franke, “Now is the
time we have the chance to compete
and compete often.”

The lineup is nearly set and
Franke is sending out a very young
squad which includes six freshmen.
Freshman Rich Paini will drop down
to 118, junior co-captain Larry Pilkey
is set at 126, as is freshman Doug
Lamb at 134. Senior co-captain Lee
Garlove is at 142, freshman Cary

Junior point guard Jim Casey
contributed 12, and sophomore Mark
Melton and freshman Bryan Watkins
each had eight.

Junior forward Ed Hart, who had
seven points and six rebounds in the
first half, sustained a stress fracture
in his foot and did not play in the
second half. The Generals also played
the majority of the second half with-
out early—season catalyst Craig Hat-
ﬁeld. The junior power forward was
ejected for ﬁghting just over two
minutes into the second half. Still,
Hatfield was able to lead the team in
rebounds with seven. Junior captain
Mike Holton was saddled with foul
trouble, and fouled out after playing
only 21 minutes.

Where Friday night’s win was
bolstered by the inside play of Ja-
cobs, Saturday, the guards exploded
for a school record 12 three-point
goals. Recent history has it that when
the Generals make five or more bo-
nus shots, they are undefeated, win-
ning 19 in a row coming into the
game.

The shock of losing a three—year
starter in Hart was taken away by the
return of junior swingman Pat Gal-
lavan, who had struggled after getting
two early season starts. Taking Hart’s
spot in the starting ﬁve, the Lake

Forest, Illinois native got W&L off

Junior forward Ed Hart shoots against Randolph-Macon College in a

set for tourney

Potts will grapple at 150, and fresh-
man Ryland Scott will anchor 158.
Sophomore Peer Soderberg is
locked in at 167, freshman Jamie
Selway is at 177, and freshman John
Conkling will handle the heavyweight
chores. Only freshman Stewart
Green’s status at 190 is uncertain.

Commenting on the long Christ-
mas break, Franke noted that some
wrestlers had the opportunity to work
out more than others, but the vacation
was beneﬁcial to all because every-
one came back without injury and
rested mentally. The break was a
sacriﬁce the team made to return
rested and healthy.

Franke is anxious to see his un-
tested team hit the mats this week-
end. The General mentor noted it
would be “interesting” to see how
the younger team members perform
in a competitive situation.

The last competition the W&L
grapplers were involved in was the
Lebanon Valley Tournament over the
weekend of December 1-2. There,

half of the six participating wrestlers
placed against 16 other high-caliber
Division III teams.

Pilkey recorded 12 takedowns en
route to a 3-3 weekend record and a
sixth place showing. Soderberg took
three decisions while dropping only
two to gain seventh place. Scott
grabbed eighth place while gaining
valuable experience in collegiate
wrestling.

Said Pilkey, “The freshmen made
some young mistakes that will be
corrected with some experience. Our
performance showed a lot of hope for
what will happen later in the year. I
think we should really come on about
the time of the State meet._"

The coach also stressed the need
for his youngsters to continually
progress and improve, noting that the
Lebanon Valley tournament against
stronger Division III squads helped.
The other Washington and Lee grap-
plers that competed were John

Conkling, Cary Potts. and Jamie
Selway.

Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee men’s
and women’s swimming teams re-
turned early frorri Christmas break for
two-a-day workouts in preparation for
the bulk of their schedules.

“Our training has accomplished a
lot this break,” head coach Page
Reniillard said. "We’re getting in a
lot of hard work, and that's impor-
tant. It’s a prerequisite if we're
going to swim well at the end of the
year."

Both the men and the women
hosted Shippensburg, a Division 11
school, last night at Twombly Pool.

“They’re a well-coached team,”
Rerriillaiid said. “We haven't beaten
them for a few years.”

Missing from the men’s lineup
was senior All-American Dave Olson
who sustained an elbow injury in
early December.

“He’s already back in the water
and he may swim on Sunday, but we

don't want to bring him along too
quickly,” Reniillard said.

Although Olson's absence leaves
the men with only eight swimmers.
Remillard is not overly concerned.

“They're all pretty good swim-
mers," he said. “We can survive...
we hope.”

Olson did not swim in the meet
against Shippensburg. The men lost
their meet 111-72 despite wins from
junior Jim Dunleavy and sophomore
Doug Brown.

The women fared a little better,
dropping a close meet 104-100.
Freshman Claire Dudley continued on
her successful season, bringing home
a victory.

On Sunday, the Generals will face
Charleston, a traditional NAIA swim-
ming power, in the Cy Twombly
Pool at 7 p.m.

“This is our first meet with them
and it should be a tough one for us,
but I think we'll swim well on Sun-
day,” said Remillard.

Prior to Christmas break the
men’s team was defeated by William

Irons heads list of Generals
named to All-America team

From W&L Sports Infonnatlon

Washington and Lee's record-
breaking split end Craig Irons, who
caught 75 passes for 1,010 yards in
1989, led a quartet of Generals hon-
ored last week by Football Gazette
magazine as Division III football All-
Americans.

Irons, a junior from Dallas, Texas,
was named a second team Division
HI All-America by the magazine,
which is devoted exclusively to small
college football. Irons set W&L sin-
gle-season records for receptions and
yards and was ranked ﬁfth in the
nation in receiving in Division III
with 7.5 catches per game.

Irons was joined on the Football
Gazette All-America squad by quar-
terback Phillip Sampson, tight end
Bob Martin, and linebacker Mike
Pack. Sampson, Martin and Pack all
received honorable mention honors.

Sampson, a senior, finished his

W&L career with 12 school passing
records, including single game and
career records for passing yards,
completions, completion percentage,
touchdowns and passing efﬁciency
rating.

Martin, the Generals second-lead-
ing receiver in 1989, had 36 catches
for 349 yards and three touchdowns
in his senior season, only his second
as tight end. Martin had the garne-
winning touchdown catch in W&L's
21-17 win over Sewanee.

Pack, a four-year starter and tri-
captain of the team, ﬁnished his ﬁnal
season as the Generals’ leading tack-
ler for the second time in his career.
Pack had 103 total tackles in 1989
and also made two interceptions. He
finished with 395 career tackles and
averaged nearly 11 tackles a game
for his career.

All four Generals were first team
All-Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence and first team All-State.

The Ring-tum Phi, January 11, 1990

Shippensburg nips swimmers

and Mary, 134-100. However, that
score is deceiving since William and
Mary competes in diving whereas
W&L does not. The Tribe collected
all 32 possible points in the one and
tliree-meter diving events.

“We swam well,” Rernillard said.
“But they have diving and that made
the difference in the meet.”

Olson and sophomore Jay Smith
each swam to two first-place finishes.
Olson won the 200-yard Individual
Medley (1:58.76) and the 200 back-
stroke (2:0l.46). Smith earned the
top spot in the 50 free (21.56) and
the 100 free (47.97).

After three conference meets the
women's team owns the best times in
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference in every event except the
1650 free and the 200 free relay.

The women began December with
a victory over Sweet Briar, 159-103.
On December 6, a victory over Hol-
lins (181-81) ensured an undefeated
season for the women in ODAC dual
meets. The women have lost only
one ODAC meet in the past four

of being behind the microphone as the nation watched a miracle and a
monstrosity. His sentence in 1980 was a headline in every major paper
in the country, and his fragment in 1989 told the nation that something
was drastically wrong in San Francisco.

In 1980, Lake Placid, N.Y. was the sight of the Winter Olympics. An
amazing feat in itself was that the U.S. hockey team had made it into the
championship round. In the serriifinals, the Americans, led by goalie Jim
Craig, defenseman Ken Morrow and forwards Mike Eruzione and Mark
Johnson, took on the Russian hockey machine.

With Craig playing like a brick wall in the nets, Johnson sparked the
U.S. attack, tying the game at three with his second goal of the game
with 0:01 left in the second period. When Eruzione, the captain, scored
midway through the ﬁnal period, the U.S. had a 4-3 lead.

With ﬁve seconds remaining, the U.S. still held the lead, and Michaels
asked America the most famous question of the decade: “DO YOU

BELIEVE IN MIRACLES?’ ’

Nine years later in San Francisco, Michaels and baseball counterparts
Tim McCarver and Jim Palmer were doing the pre-garne show for Game
3 of the World Series, when time stopped. As McCarver was describing
the key play of game two, the press box in Candlestick Park began to
shake. Michaels interrupted his colleague and managed to say “FOLKS,
WE’RE HAVING AN..." before power went completely dead.

That sentence and a fragment bookend the 1980s. I know I left out a
lot of things that many people deemed worthy of remembrance; each
person will take his own memories into the 1990s. I'd just like to hear
Michaels say one more time, “DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES?”

But for now, welcome back, and happy new year.

DEFENSE

from page 6

Vincent, nailing two three-pointers to
start the game. Shooting an anemic
29 percent coming into the game, he
erupted for a career-high 20 points
on six-of-11 shooting.

Said Canﬁeld, “I could have
started any number of people for
different reasons. I had a hunch about
Pat starting. My hunch was right. He
got those first couple of three-point
baskets, and after that you’ve just got
to believe.”

St. Vincent did a good job of
concentrating on stopping Jacobs,
holding him to 12 points, but by
concentrating on Jacobs, the Bearcats
allowed the outside players to roam
free. Holton, Casey, Watkins and
Gallavan continually killed the Bear-
cats with timely three-pointers.

Holton led the way with five on
the way to a season high 24. Casey
nailed three trifectas on the way to
his ﬁfth straight double ﬁgure per-
forrnance. He ﬁnished with 15. Wat-
kins continued to shine, nailing both
of his three-point attempts. The
freshman leads the team in three-
point accuracy, hitting 64 percent.

The game hinged on two technical
fouls called on St. Vincent coach
Bernie Matthews. After protesting a
call too vehemently, Matthews was
given a technical foul with the score
71-66 W&L. He reacted by kicking

.his chair in a manner not unlike

Indiana coach Bob Knight. The re-
sult: technical foul #2.

Jacobs made all four foul shots
and then scored two straight lay-ups
to give the Generals a 78-66 lead,
which proved to be too much for the
Bearcats to overcome, as the’ Generals
won their ﬁfth straight game 93-89.
Holton was named to the all-touma-
ment team, as was Jacobs, who wal-
ked away with Most Valuable Player
honors.

Canﬁeld was pleased with the
efforts the substitutes put in. “You
never know how a team will react
when a they lose a three-year starter.
We had some kids come off the
bench, namely [6’7” sophomore]
John [Witherington] (six points, seven
rebounds), [6’6” junior] Scott [Al-
rutz] (three, six), and Bryan W., who
all played really nice basketball.”

The Generals closed out the week
by diving back into Old Dorriinion
Athletic Conference play, starting
with Bridgewatcr, who W&L had
trounced 87-66 in the last game be-
fore exams. Six Generals scored in
double ﬁgures in that game.

.. I was more upset
than I’ve ever been
in my life about
team defense. I am
very disturbed with
the way this team
plays defense.

- Vern_e__§anfieI_c_i

But the second game was nothing
at all like the first game. The Gener-
als showed little if any emotion
thro_ughout the game, and their
performance left Canfield totally
disgusted with their defensive play.

Said Canﬁeld, “I was more upset
than I’ve ever been in my life about
team defense. I am very (llSlhl‘bC(l
with the way this team plays defense.
I am concerned with that and I will
extend this team to a point where l
think they can play team defense.
That is the only way you win
championships.”

Despite their poor defense, the
Generals still had a chance to win the
game. Melton scored a lay up with
23 seconds to play to tie the game at
66, but BC’s Neil Burke hit the first
of two free throws with just seven
seconds remaining to give the Eagles
a 67-66 lead. Gallavan was not able
to get off a shot as he was double-
teamed in the comer as time expired.

The loss dropped the Generals to
7-3, 3-2 in ODAC play on the
season. Tonight the Generals will
look to regain their winning ways
against the Maroons of Roanoke
College, winners of their last three
games. Last season the Generals beat
Roanoke three times. Game time is
set for 7:30 p.m. in the Wanicr
Center.

Hazing has no place in the fraternity experi-

It is a dangerous fonn of intimidation that

Notice how the words reach out and
grab you. In my high school journal-
ism class Mr. Gaherty taught us to
begin an article with a sure-fire sen-
tence that would compel the reader to
devour the article. Perhaps Steven
Soderbergh, who wrote and directed
“sex, lies, and videotape,” also had
Mr. Gaherty for Journalism 101, be-
cause the title of his film certainly
gets your attention. Yesterday I was
almost ,involved in an accident be-
cause some driver on State street
came to a complete stop and stared
at this shocking title on the theater
marquee. When I came to Lexington
the town still had blue laws; now
local theaters are displaying film titles
that would make your grandmother
blush.

I don't know exactly what to
write about “sex, lies, and video-
tape.” Shortly after the final credits
stopped rolling, I turned to a friend
and remarked that the theater lobby
should sell Cliff’s Notes — then I
might understand the celluloid images
that had just ﬂashed before my eyes.
I had the same reaction last year
when the Washington and Lee Film
Society brought “Blue Velvet” to
campus. I admit that “sex, lies, and
videotape” is not gory or violent like
“Blue Velvet,” but both films deal
with such bizarre sexual perversion
that the moviegoer is utterly bafﬂed.
l’m hard-pressed to say whether the
film has any coherent message.

I am not alone in my perplexity
over the ﬁlm. I took a brief, and
very informal, survey of W & L
students who saw “sex, lies, and vid-
eotape.” Some comments: “the film
was somewhere between introspective
and psychotic"...“it was so
weird”...“t.he movie just went on
forever”...“it was a bit depressing
and lacked any sense of

ii"

morality”...“You expect a movie to
have a logical conclusion, but at the
end the most screwed-up people turn
out to be the most normal.” And
these are the sanitized observations.

The film stars the beautiful model
Andie MacDowell, who plays the part
of Ann Bishop Mulaney. MacDow-
ell's character is a sexually-repressed
woman who talks with her therapist
constantly about such stirring issues
as garbage disposal methods and the
families of airline fatalities. At one
point she remarks of herself: “the
last time I was happy, I put on twen-
ty-five pounds.” Ann is walking
through life in a stupor as she tries
to maintain the charade of a marriage
with her philandering husband.

Peter Gallagher’ is cast as John
Mulaney. He does a fine job breath-
ing life into his unsympathetic role.

Andie MacDowell, however,
strikes me as a one-dirnensional ac-
tress who landed the only role suit-
able for her limited dramatic abilities.
If one merely sees “sex, lies, and
videotape,” then they might come
away with the opinion that Mac-
Dowell is a skilled actress. She
successfully portrays a woman who is
so neurotic and restrained that she
stumbles through her sinking life like
a zombie. But, unfortunately for
MacDowell, that is her acting style.
In one of her first roles, the very
British Jane in “Tarzan," her acting
was so wooden that Glemi Close had
to re—dub MacDowell's lines. If you
watched “Saturday Night Live"
before Christmas, when Andie Mac-
Dowell was the guest host, then you
discovered that she reads cue-cards
with even less proficiency than Bob
Hope. But I will admit that, for this
one limited role, MacDowell does
bring some believability to the char-
acter of Ann Mulaney.

Ann Bishop’s colorless life be-
comes complicated when her hus-
band’s old college roommate enters
her life. James Spader is cast as
Graham Dalton--a friend who has
grown progressively weirder since his

college days with John.

Graham’s philosophy of life is
simple: he lives out of his car be-
cause he wants to carry around only
one key. If Graham buys a house,
then he might have to deal with two
keys. And the idea of working is out
since his boss might ask Graham to
close the store--which involves even
more of those insidious keys. His
lifestyle causes John to remark that
“Graham dresses like an undertaker
to the art world."

James Spader’s acting style makes
MacDowell seem ﬂamboyant in com-
parison. Spader usually stares mo-
rosely at his friends and attempts to
speak his lines without moving any
facial muscles. You have to drink
lots of coffee before watching this
film.

However, Graham has some of the
movie’s more clever and thought-
provoking lines; his comments about
lawyers, calling them the lowest life
form on earth for example, almost
kept me from sending in my law
school applications.

Moveover, Graham has a disturb-
ing habit that Ann discovers: he likes
to videotape women as they talk
about their sexual histories. That is
all I will reveal about the plot--I
can’t give away all the secrets--but
you can bet that Graham’s little hob-
by quickly involves John, Ann, Cyn-
thia Bishop, (Arm's sister) and even
Graham himself.

“sex, lies, and videotape” is
filmed like oncof Graham’s videos.
The shots are bright and grainy, and
the picture constantly wobbles. At
times the camera zooms in for unset-
tling closeups, and the lens watches
our players like a judgmental eye.
The audio picks up every rustle of
clothing and turn of a magazine page,
but the dialogue sometimes dissolves
into feedback and garbled utterances.
I suppose Soderbergh uses this tech-
nique to create the sensation of watc-
hing a video within a video. Yet I
didn’t think his method was actually
that clever, and it doesn't take long

Read "3" I“ “‘°'°I‘"

figure out the symbolism of the di-
rector’s style. Furthermore, I was
ultimately distracted by the sloppy,
home-made feel of» the movie. If I
want to see over-exposed scenes, a
shaky picture, and bizarre camera
angles, then I'll go watch some of
my father's home-movies.

I honestly don’t understancl the
rave reviews that the film is receiv-
ing. Roger Ebert said that “sex,
lies, and videotape‘ was one of those
well-written pieces we expect from
somebody like Woody Allen."

I have mentioned in earlier rc-
views that I am a fan of Wocxly
Allen, but I don't understand why
Ebert places this film in the same
class as Allen. I don't think the
dialogue is that witty or realistic, the
documentary style is very heavy-
handcd, and the audience is given a
typical Hollywood ending.

If there is any deep message in
the film, then maybe it forces us to
concentrate on the relations between
men and women. Is there a lack of
morality in our sexual practices that
will ultimately wreck our well-or-
dered lives? Is Soderbergh berating
the “thirtysomething" crowd? I
can’t provide a good answer.

Possibly the ﬁlm is just too deep
for this reviewer. I did not enjoy
“sex, lies, and videotape.” Peppers
will give the movie a “C," which
places it lower than “Uncle Buck"
on my movie poll — that confirms
how sophisticated I am! At the start
of the article, I mentioned how my
old high school instructor taught my
journalism class to begin an article
with an “attention—gctter.” But Mr.
Gaherty also told us that the rest of
the article must back up that initial
burst of interest. Soderbergh fails to
produce a film that can follow his
racy title.

“sex, lies, and videotape" is cur-
rently showing at the State Theater.
It is rated “R” for profanity and
strong sexual content. I wouldn’t
waste money on it... the Film Society
is showing it free next month.

ODK to induct 21;
classes shortened

Wilson is speaker

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

Omicron Delta Kappa, the national honorary
fraternity started here at Washington and Lee in
1914 by a group of twelve students, will tap
21 students and four honorary members as part
of the Founders Day celebration tomorrow.

ODK is an organization that seeks to
recognize superior leaders within the university
and bring them together to work on projects for
W&L and the city of Lexington.

The names of the twenty one-new members
are a closely guarded secret and will not be
announced until the actual ceremony tomorrow.
The new members were notiﬁed before Christ-
mas so they could make any necessary
arrangements, said Dean of Students Lewis G.
John, the faculty secretary for ODK.

According to John, membership in the
organization comes in recognition of leadership
in ﬁve separate categories:

- scholastic achievement (all members must
be in the top 35% of their class);

- athletics;

- social, service and campus government;

- journalism, speech and mass media;

- creative and performing arts.

John said that last spring the ODK selection
committee, comprised of student members and
four voting faculty members, tapped seven
rising seniors who will also be recognized in
tomorrow's ceremony.

This fall, the comrriittee tapped the group of
21 students: five juniors, twelve seniors, and
four tliird-year law students.

ODK used to tap members only in the fall,
but added the spring selection two years ago.

for Founders Day

Here is tomorrow's adjusted class

schedule:
Hour Time
A 8 a.m. - 8:45 a.m.
B 8:50 a.m. - 9:35 am.
C 9:40 a.m. - 10:25 a.m.
D 10:30 a.m. - 11:15 a.m.
E 11:20 a.m. - 12:05 p.m.

ASSEMBLY 12:15 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.
F 1:50 a.m. - 2'35 p.m
G 2:40 a.m. - 3 25 p.m.
H 3:30 a.m. - 4.15 p.m.
l 4:20 a.m. - 5:05 p.m.
J 5:10 a.m. - 5'55 p.m.

“It provides a larger nucleus of members
during the beginning of the year," John said.
“The circle can be more active and plan events
throughout the year. In the old days, there were
only four or five undergraduates [each fall] to
plan events and elect new members."

ODK President J. Wayne Burris said that
some activities ODK will be involved in during
the upcoming months are: a panel discussion
about cultural diversity at W&L and the
uriiversity’s role in promoting it; a leadership
seminar for student leaders at Lexington High
School; a leadership seminar at W&L this spr-
ing for the new class officers, new Executive
Committee members, and new fraternity and
sorority presidents.

Already this year ODK sponsored the
discussion about ﬂag-burning led by Edwin
Yoder and held the 75th Anniversary
celebration of ODK national here in the fall,
according to John.

Fraternity workshop
follows hazing charge

By Chuck Broll
Staff Reporter

Last week’s fratemity-wide leadership work-
shop, sponsored by Phi Kappa Sigma, was “the
positive result of a negative incident,” Phi Kap
President Brooks Pettus said.

Methods of updating pledge activities, food
programs and leadership techniques were the
focal points of the workshop, which was at-
tended by Iriterfraterriity Council President
Kevin Nash, Associate Dean of Students Leroy
C. “Buddy" tkins and most of the presidents
or officers of &L's fraternities.

According to Pettus, an activity that was
part of Phi Kap’s pledge program last winter
was considered an act of hazing by representa-
tives of Phi Kap‘s national headquarters.

“The incident was handled internally and
the problem was immediately exorcised. It
ultimately served as a platform for radical
change, giving Phi Kap the chance to create a
positive and creative pledge education pro-
gram,” Pettus said.

“It’s time for attitudes to change, and
programs like this can only help,” Pettus said.

W&L’s first sorority Rush to conclude

—
By Alisann McGloin
Staff Reporter

Bids from Washington and Lee
University's three established sorori-
ties will be extended Saturday, con-
cluding W&L’s first sorority Rush.

Rush began Sunday night with
Open Houses in the University Cen-
ter. Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kap-
pa Garrirna and Chi Omega, as well
as Delta Gamma, participated in the
first night of Rush.

Delta Gamma took part on the
first night, but its national representa-

tives will return Wednesday to con-
duct their own colonization.
Monday, the rushees attended
parties in the University Center and
Dupont Hall to watch skits presented
by each sorority.
Rushees were invited to attend the

sororities’ ‘ ‘sisterhood" and “pre-
ference” arties Wednesda and

Friday.

“Exactly a year ago, we were
going through Rush. It’s amazing
how far sororities have come to put
on a good rush," said Courtney
Payne, Panhellenic Membership Selec-
tion Chairman.

Leslie has chronic

Golf Coach Emmett G.“Buck”
Leslie was released from Roanoke
Memorial Rehabilitation Hospital
Saturday after eight days of treatment
for chronic leukemia.

Leslie, 64, said he went to Stone-
wall Jackson Hospital for a physical
because he had been feeling fatigued.

He was immediately sent to
Roanoke for further tests.

“I hadn't been in for a routine
check-up for about 18 years. I know
it's dumb... but I always felt fine
until recently,” he said.

On Jan.5 he was diagnosed as
having chronic leukemia and was
admitted to the rehabilitatioh hospital
in Roanoke, he said. He was treated
with chemotherapy medication for
three days and is not expecting to
need radiation treatment.

Leslie was also diagnosed as a
diabetic with an enlarged spleen.

Unlike acute leukemia, chronic
leukerriia does not arise abruptly and
progress rapidly. While survival is
measured in months for acute
patients, chronic leukemia is not as
dramatic and carries fewer complica-
tions. »

Leslie is currently being moni-
tored as an outpatient at Stonewall
Jackson Hospital where doctors are

“We’re very excited about it
simply because it's our first Rush.
We hope that the freshman women
find their place at Washington and
Lee through the sororities and be-
come more uniﬁed," said Pamela
Kelley, a member of Kappa Alpha
Theta.

Freshman Walton Eagan said,
“One of the things I was most im-
pressed with is that this is the first
year they’re doing this...they seem
like old pros.”

Rush counselors, or “Rho Chis,”
were chosen from each of the three
sororities to advise the 116 rushees

trying to stabilize his blood sugar
level. He will return to Roanoke on
Jan. 26 for a check-up.

A physical education teacher at
Washington and Lee since 1960,
Leslie is planning to coach the golf
team again this spring. He is unsure
about resuming instruction of his P.E.
classes.

“I’ve been getting lots of phone
calls and some flowers and cards.
It’s just been beautiful.

“I feel good,” he said. “My
doctor even told me I can play golf
if I want to."

“It should have positive effects on the presi-
dents and officers who attended.”

Phi Kap pledge trainer Michael Applebaum
outlined the new pledge program at the worksh-
op, sayirig it included “a good deal” of
community service projects. Applebaum also
said pledges are expected to use and learn from
“Skull Sessions,” the Phi Kap national book.

Other outlined activities to create a more
successful pledge program include a pledge-act-
ive football game and big brother-little brother
activities such as a barbecue, a trip to George-
town and a Virginia Lancer’s hockey game.

Phi Kap pledge Reed Duncan said he does-
n’t know what pledges did in the past, but he
does know that what they are doing now has
made a difference in the community.

“Providing social services for the com-
munity has been an overall positive ex-
perience,” Duncan said.

Junior Phi Kap Tom Costello agreed.

“We can look to see a pledge program
geared more toward community service rather
than just serving the brothers. Community
service is a good example in showing the
pledges how their efforts are needed and ap-

who participated in formal Rush.

These “Rho Chi’s,” in addition
to the Panhellenic officers and deleg-
ates, disaffiliated themselves from
their sororities outside of formal
meetings until Rush is over.

The “Rho Chi’s” disaffiliated
themselves from their sororities so
that the rushees would “have some-
one to answer their questions without
bias,” said Kate Hanley, who is a
rush counselor. .

Payne explained, “Our duty during
rush is to serve the Panhellenic As-
sociation, not our individual sorori-
tv.”

 
Corrections

A story in last week’s Phi
about the Jan. 8 Executive Com-
mittee meeting repeated an error
that appeared originally in the EC
minutes. Robert Martin was
appointed to the Constitutional
Revisions Comrriittee, riot Robert
Tompkins.

Also, a tirneline detailing the
history of sororities at W&L
incorrectly stated the Panhellenic
Association’s status on the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. The
PHA has a voice on all issues
and a vote on those issues affect-
ing the PHA.

The Phi apologizes for the
confusion.

Hanley said many of the women
in her group of ‘rushees were worried
about the selection process.

Sunday and Monday nights, all
women who registered for Rush could
attend each of the four Open Houses.
However, rushees had to be invited to
Wednesday and Friday nights’ parties.

At “Preference” parties, the
rushees fill out a “preference card,”
placing the sororities in order of their
preference. The number of bids each
sorority may extend is calculated by
the number of rushees who fill out
preference cards divided by the three
sororities.

Some of the rushees may choose
not to fill out a preference card and
go through Delta Garrirna’s rush the
following week.

Panhellenic rules prohibit sorority
members from participating in social
functions during the week of Rush.

Payne said that each time a soror-
ity member fails to abide by the rule,
it will count as an infraction against
that sorority.

Rushees also have been asked by
Panhellenic not to participate in social
functions as a courtesy to the active
members, although they do not come
under Panhellenic jurisdiction.

George faces Pringle
in runoff for EC post

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

Stephen George and John “Jack”
Pringle will see their names on the
ballot once again as they run-off for
the seat of senior representative on
the Executive Committee tomorrow.

The Voting Regulations Board
posted the tally of yesterday’s 217
votes. Pringle led the trio with 87,
George and Todd Peppers trailing
with 67 and 63 respectively.

The constitution dictates that "If
no candidate has a majority in the
general election for one position, a
rtm—off election shall be held between

the two candidates receiving the
largest number of votes...." Voting
for that run-off will be tomorrow
from 8 a.m. to 4 pm., according to
the VRB.

The senior representative seat was
vacated when Judson Parker resigned
the role in November. The Ring-tum
Phi on Nov. 16 reported his with-
drawal from Washington and Lee for
personal reasons.

“The senior rep position is ex-
tremely important,” said EC Vice
President Jonathan Sheinberg, “and
either of the two candidates I'm
confident will do a fine job.” Shein-
berg wished luck to both.

 

  

OPINION

 

Swing on a star

When Washington and Lee’s men fall in line,
we're going to win again another time.

For W&L I yell, I yell, I yell,
and for the u-ni-ver-si-ty I yell like hell.

At football games, the “W&L Swing” gets fans out of
their seats. In space, it wakes the Space Shuttle Colum-
bia’s astronauts to start another day.

It’s customary for Mission Control in Houston, to wake
the astronauts with a rousing tune. If all went as planned,
this moming’s tune was the “W&L Swing.”

Astronaut G. David Low graduated from Washington
and Lee in 1978 with a degree in physics and engineer-
ing, and is honoring his alma mater by taking some items
peculiar to the University into space with him.

Aboard Columbia is a copy of the White Book and the
Mission Statement. Also, a W&L hat, t—shirt and bumper
sticker are on the shuttle.

Even in his stardom, Low remembered his school and
its fight song.

Sadly enough, however, the swing is in danger of
falling by the traditional wayside. If the choruses ever
quit singing the swing, still fewer students would know
the words.

Other schools use the “W&L Swing” at their football
games. University of Miami’s Band of the Hour has been
known to play the tune before the Hurricanes take the
field.

It’s sad to think that our school’s ﬁght song faces the
prospect of becoming something that used to be tradition-
al at Washington and Lee.

At the very least, the “W&L Swing” will be known as
the tune Mission Control used to wake Columbia’s astro-
nauts on the program’s 33rd mission.

Ours and yours

The Ring-tum Phi, as the Washington and Lee student
newspaper, feels an obligation to publish each and every
student-opinion piece it receives, and we encourage
students and other members of the W&L community to
submit letters or “My Views.” However, we reserve the
right to edit any and all submissions for reasons of taste,
libel, clarity or length.

The Phi is no more our newspaper than it is yours. The
quality and diversity of its opinion page are dependent on
your submissions.

Owning up to King’s ‘Dream’

MY VIEW
By Leslie R. Smith

When the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke
those provocative words in his “I have a dream”
speech, he was speciﬁcally addressing the social,
political, economic and educational injustices
prevailing in America at that time; and which,
despite the valiant efforts by many institutions, still
exist today. Although it would be unfair to deny
that blacks have overcome some of the social,
political, economic and educational barriers con-
fronting them during the civil rights era, America
has quite a ways to go before full reparations are
made. Perhaps, put in the proper historical perspec-
tive, those of you who were too young to remem-
bet, or not yet born, the burgeoning of the civil
rights movement, will see that the Dream cannot
yet be realized.

The creed that “all men are created equal"
might go without saying today. But, it was only
133 years ago that the U.S. Supreme Court held
that blacks were not citizens of the United States,
and that the language in the Declaration of Inde-

pendence did not include blacks. Then, in 1868,
when Congress in the 14th Amendment, declared
blacks were citizens, the Supreme Court intervened
again to permit states to arbitrarily segregate
citizens on the basis of race under the pretense that
public facilities and accommodations were “sepa-
rate 'but equal.” Similarly, when the right to vote
was granted by the l5th Amendment in 1870,
states devised numerous schemes to specifically
keep blacks from exercising that right.

These injustices went uncorrected for many
years. Indeed, it was not until 1954, some 58 years
after the institutionalization of the “separate but
equal" doctrine, that the Supreme Court held the
doctrine had no place in the field of education.

. Furthermore, it was not until 1965 that the Voting

Rights Act coupled with an additional measure
taken by Congress ensured that no state would
deprive a person of the right to vote because of
race — some 95 years after the passage of the 15th
Amendment. In spite of Congress and the court's
acknowledgement of these injustices, something
more had to be done to remedy their effects.

To this end, affirmative action-type programs
were implemented with two principal goals in
mind: 1) to place blacks on an equal footing with

their white counterparts; and 2)to make reparation
for the past wrongs. Yet, even with these affirm-
itive action-type programs, the social, political,
economic and educational disparities between the
races are still quite evident.

Thus, although Mr. Lake’s view of the Dream,
which appeared in last week’s Phi, may be laud-
able and achievable at some point in the future, the
Dream is far from being fully realized. Surely, it
will take more than two decades to fully disman-
tle a system of injustice that existed for more than
four centuries.

Accordingly, it is my view that until we can no
longer say that today’s black college students are
first or second generation college graduates, the
dream cannot be realized; until we can look around
the major colleges and universities and see more
that one black tenured faculty member, the dream
cannot be realized; until we can no longer say
that there is a black economic base but no black
business in a given area, the dream cannot be
realized; until the criminal justice system treats
black and white suspects alike, the dream cannot
be realized. This, in my view, is the indicia of
America owning up to her creed that "all men are
created equal.”

MY VIEW
By Scott Bahrke

Now that Manuel Noriega sits in
a U.S. jail awaiting trial, and the
82nd Airborne has triumphantly para-
chuted back into Fort Bragg, N.C.,
we can assess the effects of -our
recent intervention in Panama. Opera-
tion Just Cause was clearly a re-
sounding success. The American sol-
diers achieved their objectives with
minimal losses. Yes, Mr. Adams,
whose column appeared in last
week’s Phi, was right — December
1989 will be remembered as the
“Panamanian Christmas" — the year
U.S. soldiers gave a large gift called
“freedom” to the Panamanian people.

Mr. Adams, however, would have
withheld that gift in favor of other

marine, and surveillance capacity to
“blockade all regions containing
potential allies of the resistance.”
The last time we blocked Cuba, the
United States and the Soviet Union
almost plunged the world into nuclear
destruction. The political, military and
economic ramifications of blockading
all regions of resistance far outweigh
the cost of our recent actions in
Panama and make Mr. Adams’
proposal unwise at best.

He also hints at legalizing drugs
to solve 'our problems. I don’t see
any corollary -» between legalizing
drugs in the United Sates and the
right to exercise self-deterrnination in
Panama.

One of the only viable alternatives
we had was to support a coup at-
tempt by Panamanian forces. We lost
one promising opportunity and
couldn’t accurately predict if or when

Therefore, considering Noriega’s de-
claration of war, the vicious attack
on an American serviceman, and the
possibility of more attacks, the initia-
tion of the attack on Noriega’s re-
gime ~by U.S. servicernan was both
justifiable and timely.

Sadly, the actions cost several
hundred lives, 24 of which were
American soldiers. The opposition we
faced in Panama, however, was not
from armed civilians that performed
guerilla actions against the soldiers
like the Viet Cong did in Vietnam, it
was from remnants of the Pana-
manian Defense Force (PDF) and
some of the thugs of the “Dignity
Battalions" (DingBats). Although
there was resistance, most sur-
rendered. Many were substantially
relrired by the new government. They
alerted U.S. troops to the location of
pockets of resistance and military

soldiers as they patrolled the streets.

Unlike the Vietnam War, the
action in Panama enjoyed congres-
sional and popular support. The poll
taken by Cable News Network
showed that 90 percent of Americans
supported President Bush's decision
to overthrow Noriega. Finally, by
sending over 20,000 troops to
Panama, Bush ensured that the situa-
tion would be resolved and the troops
would return quickly.

Bush should be congratulated on
a job well done, and the soldiers who
fought there should be honored as
heroes. Second Lt. Jon Misert, a 1988
W&L graduate, was one of those
heroes called upon to fight for free-
dom. Let us also remember the 24
Americans who gave the ultimate gift
to the Panamanian people.

Peace Dividend masks the deficit

’ MY VIEW

By Damon Fensterman

As the Berlin Wall crumbles down and nations
all over Eastern Europe turn to democracy,
Washington is abuzz with talk of the “Peace
Dividend." America is supposed to prosper because
of the defense cuts which will result from a more
relaxed defense posmre. But as usual, Congress is
ready to spend the money before they have it in
hand.

The problem isn't necessarily that the expected
peace won’t come, although it is by no means
certain. Even if complete world peace is
impossible, it seems likely that we will see a
noticeable reduction in tensions between East and
West over the next 10 years. Of course, there are
no guarantees. The execution of Ceaucescu
indicates that not all of the Eastern European
upheavals are “democratic." Moreover, the recent
military intervention in Armenia suggests that the
Soviet Union is willing to go but so far in
allowing freedom. There is reason to be optimistic,
but we must season our outlooks with caution.

But the difficulty with the Peace Dividend is
not that we won't cut back on transatlantic defense

With defense spending
currently around $300
billion, we would have to
cut defense by over_haIf just
to wipe out this year’s
national defecit.

forces. We probably will. The real problem is with
a fundamental misunderstanding about where the
money came from originally. There are three
fallacies to the current popular thinking about the
so-called Peace Dividend.

First, there aren’t really any savings from
defense cuts until we stop running enormous
budget deficits. Since we borrowed part (I say part
because defense spending isnot the only cause of
the deficit) of the money for the current level of
defense, we should pay it back as we cut back on
defense.

Second, the actual cuts that will be made will
not be significant enough to rearrange the
economy. With defense spending currently around
$300 billion, we would have to cut defense by
over half just to wipe out this year’s national

deficit -— even more to create a surplus. The cuts
resulting from decreased tensions will be nowhere

I near this level, especially in the short run.

The third fallacy is the hidden assumption
behind our politicians’ reasoning. Really, all
Congress wants to do with the Peace Dividend is
spend it. They figure, since the money has already
been borrowed, why give it back now? The law of
inertia applies to Congress as well. Once a law or
policy is in place, it tends to stay there. Or put
another way, it's easier to pass legislation than to
eliminate it. Also, a cut in spending means a
reduction in fiscal stimulus. With the economy on
tenuous footing, congressmen don’t want to take
any chances with their careers.

The problem with the budget is not big defense
spending. It’s big spending, period. Certain political
groups take great delight in pointing out that the
Reagan defense buildup was the cause‘ of the
deficit, but their reasoning on the Peace Dividend
betrays their true stance. If we merely spend what
we cut back on defense, we end up with the same
size deficit and a defense sector that is a smaller
percentage of the budget. What’s the cause of
deficits then? Quite simply, the cause is the simple
textbook cause — namely, that government
spending exceeds tax receipts. Or in my opinion,
the government simply spends too much.

Debate over dollars again topped
the agenda at this week’s meeting of
the Executive Committee.

The EC unanimously approved
last week’s proposal that the Board
of Trustees raise the student activities
fee from $105 to $120 — $25 of
which will go toward the mortgage
on the student activities pavilion.

Two successive approvals were
required before the proposal could go
to the Board of Trustees. EC Presi-
dent Willard Dumas will now present
the proposal to the Board's Develop-
ment Committee on Feb. 2.

Junior Rep. John Fialcowitz, who
last week voted against the increase,
asked EC Vice President Jonathan
Sheinberg why $15 would be appro-
priate rather than some lesser amount.

Sheinberg and EC President Wil-
lard Dumas said $15 would roughly
meet the budget ‘requests entered by
student organizations this year and
would not create a surplus, consider-
ing next year’s requests will likely
increase.

The increase comes in the wake
of financial difficulties that prompted
President John Wilson to grant $16,-
000 to the EC this year. Dumas said
Wilson asked the EC to consider an
increase in the fee.

Dumas said he spoke to a number
of students about the increase and
their response was generally apathetic.
He said he expects a positive
response from the board.

The EC also discussed the $4,000
minimum balance that the Publica-
tions Board is currently required to
maintain in reserve.

According to second-year law
Rep. Mark Cobb, the Publications
Board is approaching that minimum,
which is required to help publica-
tions in the event of financial dif-
ficulties. Dumas said that the con-
stitution requires a $2,500 minimum,
and the EC could lower the board’s
minimum $1,500.

The extra money would most
likely be made available to one of
the publications requesting money
from the EC, Dumas said. The Polit-
ical Review has requested $1,700;
increased costs have left The Calyx in
need of $2,000, and Cobb said The
Washington and Lee Journal of Sci-
ence will ask for $950.

Cobb agreed to look into whether
the $4,000 minimum is needed.

Joei Dyes presented a request to
the EC for $250 for the fourth annual
Lip Synch, a benefit for Students
Against Multiple Sclerosis and the
National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

Under the direction of W&L Food
Service Director Gerald Darrell, Lip
Synch is set for the night of Jan. 26
at the General Headquarters. All
proceeds will benefit the MS Society,
said Dyes.

Dyes said Darrell would like the
EC’s assistance to help pay for the
more expensive prizes offered this
year. The prizes range from $150 and
two Fancy Dress tickets for first
place to $25 and one FD ticket for
third place. A fourth—place prize has

not yet detemrined.

Dumas suggested that funding for
the prizes be taken from the money
raised, as the EC does not normally
use student funds for charitable con-
tributions. Third-year law Rep. David
Anthony added that the EC’s already
constrained budget for this year may
make a charitable contribution espe-
cially difficult to allocate.

Dyes said the EC has provided
money for the event in past years.

Dyes also suggested that the EC
enter the contest, saying it would
encourage other organizations to
enter, thereby raising more money.

Admission to the GHQ that night
will be $3, Dyes said. The cost for
each group to enter is $25. Groups
may sign up from Jan. 22 to Jan. 24,
11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Evans Dining
Hall and in front of the Coop; 5:30
to 6:30 p.m. at Evans Dining Hall;
and 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at Carol
Calkins’ office.

Petitions with at least 150 signa-
tures for the Big Three offices -— EC
president, vice president and secretary
— are due Feb. 5, followed by an
election on Feb. 12 and a run—off on
Feb. 15.

The EC adjourned Monday’s
meeting with best wishes for the
speedy recovery of Chemistry Prof.
Keith Shillington. According to Prof.
Michael Pleva, Shillington entered
hospital care on Jan. 10 with symp-
toms which may have resulted from
a stroke.

The EC also wished Coach Em-
met “Buck” Leslie a speedy re-
covery. Leslie has chronic leukemia.

New managers in the W&L Food Service depart-
ment are, from left to right, Chef William B. King;

New faces jump in food line

 

From the W&L News Office

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Food Service has announced
three changes in the management of
Evans Dining Hall and the Co-op.

Charles Durm retired as chef on
Dec. 31 after 20 years at Washington
and Lee. The manager of Evans
Dining Hall, Todd Morse, resigned in
December to accept the position of
food service department computer
analyst at Syracuse University. Rich-

  

ard Armstrong, manager of the Co-
op, also resigned in December to
accept a position at James Madison
University.

Durm's successor is William B.
King, former executive chef at the
University of Virginia. A graduate of
the University of Maine, King receiv-
ed his certificate in professional cook-
ing and food service standards from
Purdue University in 1989. At U.Va.,
King also served as director of spe-
cial events and catering.

Succeeding Morse is John T.

John  Taffe, Evans Dining Hall manager; and
Gail Dixon, Co-Op Manager.

Taffe, who completed professional
training as a baker, butcher, and ap-
prentice chef before attending Paul
Smitl1’s College in New York to
learn hotel and restaurant manage-
ment. He has held a variety of posi-
tions in the restaurant and food ser-
vice business.

Gail Dixon, a well-known member
of the Co-op staff, is its new manag-
er. Dixon has been with the W&L
Food Service for eight years. A na-
tive of New York, Dixon is a long-
time resident of Lexington.

R.E. Lee’s ‘honor’ vs. the Honor System

MY VIEW
By D. Ross Patterson

Young gentlemen, we have no printed
rules. We have but one rule here, and it is
that every student must be a gentlemen.

— Gen. Robert Edward Lee

This simple statement is Lee’s most
important contribution to the institution that is
now Washington and Lee University. With
these words, he founded a laudable system
that has shaped the values and actions of
generations of students. The simplicity and
absolute quality of his declaration is striking.
There are no excepting conditions — only one
rule: that every student must be a gentlemen.

In contrast to Lee’s simple, unwritten rule,
the Honor System is currently presented in a
15-page booklet (the “White Book" and an
accompanying statement on plagiarism).

In discussing the philosophy upon which
the Honor System is based, the “White
Book”, rather than quoting Lee’s statement,
employs the vague paraphrase that, “Lee
established the positive, though unprinted, rule
that students were to accept responsibility for
their own conduct.” This paraphrase loses
much of the meaning of the original. Lee’s
requirement was that students be gentlemen;
there was a definite standard of conduct to
which they were expected to conform.

Today, Lee’s Rule has been transfonned
into the pleasant platitude that students accept
responsibility for their actions. Responsibility
for one’s actions is learned from childhood,
when misbehavior resulted in punishment. The
“White Book” takes Lee’s powerful state-
ment, which provided students with greater

freedom as a reward for adherence to a
greater standard, and takes the force from it.

The “White Book" continues its commen-
tary on the philosophy of the Honor System
saying, “Today as in Lee’s day, the freedom
given to students stems from the understand-
ing that persons attending this university will
act honorably. Although this understanding
has come to be known as the “Honor Sys-
tem,” it is not a compilation of student
regulations. Rather, the system is in essence
one of mutual trust — trust among students,
faculty, administrators, and townspeople that
persons attending Washington and Lee will
not lie, cheat, or steal.”

Despite the lip service that is given to Lee
as the father of the Honor System, we have
come a long way from his simple, unwritten,
rule that all students would behave as gentle-
men. I am concerned that we have come
dangerously close to losing completely the
heritage he has bestowed upon us. It is trou-
bling that the “trust” is not that students will
behave as gentlemen, or honorably. Rather,
Honor (at least insofar as the Honor System
has been concerned) has been effectively
redefined as not lying, cheating or stealing. I
was raised in the belief that gentlemanly
behavior encompasses far more than these
three.

Lee wisely observed that “the forebearing
use of power does not only form a touch-
stone; but the manner in which an individual
enjoys certain advantages over others, is a
test of a true gentleman  The forebearing
and inoffensive use of all this power or
authority, or a total abstinence from it when
the case admits it, will show the gentlemen in
a plain light.” Honor encompasses far more
than not violating others’ trust that one will

I was raised in the belief

or stealing.

refrain from lying, cheating, or stealing.

It is also of concern that this system of
“mutual trust” is nothing of the sort. The
faculty trust us so completely that they re-
quire us to write out the pledge on exams.
This trust is so pervasive on campus that its
apparently deemed necessary to remind stu-
dents that the Honor System applies to the
University Library and the third ﬂoor of Reid
Hall. Additionally, a system of “mutual
trust" is impossible when administration and
faculty are under no obligation to behave
honorably towards the student body.

Several recent events are emblematic of
the distance which the Honor System has
come from Lee’s Rule. A recent notice from
the Student Conduct Committee indicated that
two students had been found guilty of the
infraction of breaking windows and received
an appropriate punishment for their crime. At
bottom of the notice was a reminder to the
student body that we are not only to act
honorably, but that we are also to behave as
ladies and gentlemen. This separation of
honor from gentlemanly behavior is both
inexplicable and unacceptable.

The disciplinary action taken against two
local chapters by their national fraternities is
also emblematic of the distance that the
university has come from Lee’s Rule. None
of the fraternity members involved was ac-

cused of lying, cheating, or stealing — so
they must have acted honorably, even if they
were involved in “drug abuse, hazing, van-
dalism, and ungentlernanly behavior”(which
PiKA advisor Roger Dean implied in last
week’s Phi). A return to Lee’s definition of
a gentleman would remind us that abuse of
one’s power relative to another is not the act
of a gentleman.

Date rape is a reality on this carrrpus;
however, it does not fall under the jurisdic-
tion of the Executive Committee as a dishon-
orable act. Rather, a new committee, the
Confidential Review Committee, has been
formed to handle cases of this nature. The
necessity of the creation of this new commit-
tee is indicative of a failure of the EC to
fulﬁll “their primary responsibility for enforc-
ing the system’ ’of honorable conduct.

The most recent problem with the Honor
System is its failure to indict Blake Comer.
Blake's involvement in the accident that left
a W&L freshman dead was not, in and of
itself, dishonorable; rather, the failure to take
responsibility for his act was dishonorable.
The Ring-tum Phi reported Blake told police
“he did not stop because he was ‘scared to
death and didn't know what to do.’ " That is
unacceptable.

I am willing to accept that he was scared;
however, he knew what to do. He knew that
he needed to stop the car and walk across the
street to the police station. But he was un-
willing to do that. The next morning he
awoke, and again, instead of going to the
police, he went about his daily business. He
continued in the same way, refusing to- do
what he knew he needed to do for eight
months. However, The Ring-tum Phi reported
that W&L Communications Director Brian

TALKBACK

What band would you like to see at Fancy Dress?

Blake Comer was a W&L
student. That should
cause him to conform to
a higher standard. When
tested, he failed.

Shaw has said that, “Because Comer has
withdrawn from school but has not yet been
convicted of any crime, he will remain a
student in good standing regardless of the
outcome of the case." ,

Committing a crime and engaging in what
Prof. David Parker in last week’s Phi called
“a studied effort to lessen the impact of the
situation" is not an honorable act; it is not
the behavior engaged in by a gentleman. Prof.
Parker suggested in his letter that we should
try to “care and forgive”; that Comer’s
trying “to live generously during the past
twenty years” provides a basis for forgive-
ness. However, I cannot agree with Prof.
Parker. Although I do not know Blake Com-
er, I do know that he was a W&L student.
That distinction should cause him to conform
to a higher standard of behavior. When the
test came, when his honor was tested, he
failed.

The Honor System is one of the strongest
features of this institution. It does allow us
unparalled freedoms. However, with freedom
comes responsibility. Today, the freedom and
the responsibility have grown apart as the
definition of honorable conduct has narrowed.
Lee presented a simple Rule in which the
freedom flowed from the acceptance of re-
sponsibility. We would do well to return to
his Rule.

Daly leaves W&L;

By Pat Lopes
Assignment Editor

Dennis Daly, former head lacrosse
coach and assistant professor of phys-
ical education at Washington and Lee,
resigned from W&L last December
and is now working with the lacrosse
team at Virginia Military Institute.

According to VMI Director of
Intercollegiate Athletics Eric Hyman,
Daly is now an assistant coach for
the VMI team on a voluntary basis.

Last summer, Daly was reassigned
from the position of W&L head
lacrosse coach and started the Fall
Term working only as an assistant
professor in the RE. Department.
Then in December, Daly resigned

 completely from W&L, according to

W&L Communications Director Brian
Shaw.

Daly did have a contract with
W&L extending until 1991. Shaw
refused to comment on Daly’s resig-
nation, explaining only that it was a
“personnel matter."

This week, Daly also refused to

, comment on his resignation or his

coaching at VMI. But last Spring,

Daly planned to remain at W&L.

“W&L is definitely going to
honor the next two years of Dennis

‘ Daly’s contract which is until 1991,”
A he told The Ring—tum Phi last May.

“For all you freshmen chemistry
majors, forget that sigh of relief,”
said Senior Chemistry Major Sarah
Allen, who visits “Doc Shillington”
every day for lunch.

“I know Doc's OK because he’s
still bitchin’,” said Senior Christian
Eckrnan, also a chemistry major.

Shillington has been teaching
Chemistry at W&L since 1953. He
also has the honor of crowning the
Homecoming queen every Fall and
has done so for the past 25 years.

Shillington is also well known by
people who swim in the auxiliary
pool where he takes a dip almost
every afternoon.

Watt said Shillington telephoned
him from his home last Tuesday,
during the evening. Shillington told
Watt that he felt dizzy and would not
be able to lecture the next day.

According to Watt, Shillington
called him again Wednesday morning
and said that he was having a hard
time moving the left side of his body
and that he probably suffered a stroke

Shillington told Watt that he al-
ready had a previously scheduled
appointment to see his doctor later
Wednesday, and that he could wait
until then to head for the hospital.
But Watt insisted that Shillington go
immediately to Stonewall Jackson.

At Stonewall Jackson, doctors
examined Shillington and sent him
to Roanoke for tests with a neu-
rologist. Shillington returned to
Lexington that night and has been at
Stonewall Jackson since.

ODK

from page 1

The four honorary ODK initiates
to be inducted tomorrow are Mervyn
F. Silverrnan, ‘60; Thomas P. Ride-
out, ‘63; James W. Head III, ‘64; and
W&L psychology Prof. Leonard E.
Jarrard.

Silverrnan is one of the nation’s
foremost experts in AIDS research.
He is president of the only privately
funded AIDS research organization in
the country, the American Foundation
for AIDS Research.

Rideout is a member of the advi-
sory board of the W&L School of
Commerce, Economics and Politics.
He recently became the executive
director of Bank Capital Markets
Association.

Head is an international authority
in planetary studies. He worked with
NASA’s Apollo program from 1968-
1972, and has taught at Brown Uni-
versity since 1973. He also has

served as a collaborating scientist
with the Russians on Mars.

Jarrard began teaching at W&L in
1959, and returned here after a seven-
year absence in 1971 to become head
of the psychology department. In
1987 he was one of 13 Virginia
college faculty members to receive an
Outstanding Faculty Award from the
Virginia Council of Higher Education.

W&L President John D. Wilson
will be the principal speaker for the
Founders Day ceremony, which will
begin at 12:15 in Lee Chapel. Wil-
son, an honorary ODK initiate in
1983, said that the linking of ODK
and Founders Day is extremely ap-
propriate. “I think that to take stock
once a year to celebrate the men and
women who step forward and begin
to take charge of things is appropri-
ate. One of the great opportunities on
campus is the renewal of leadership.”

GHQ to host 4th Lip

By Chris Bray
Staff Reporter

Have you ever dreamed of being
one of the New Kids On The Block?
Jon Bon Jovi? Kip Winger?

Such troubling dreams can come
true at W&L’s 4th Annual Lip Synch
Contest to be held Jan. 26. All
proceeds from the contest, which
starts at 8:30 p.m. in the GHQ, go to
the National Multiple Sclerosis Soci-
ety.
Prizes will be awarded to the top
three acts. First prize is $150 and
two Fancy Dress tickets. Second
prize is $50 and two FD tickets, and
the third-place act will receive $25
and one ticket to Fancy Dress.

Also, a videotape recording of the
winning act will be entered in MTV’s

national contest. National finalists
will compete live in Florida during
spring break.

Members of the Phi Gamma Delta
(FIJI) fraternity have taken top honors
the past two years with their rendi-
tions of “Relax” in 1989 and the
Village People's “YMCA” in 1988.

Gerald “Jerry” Darrell, director
of university food services, is once
again organizing the contest. Darrell
said he is looking forward to another
successful event this year.

“The past two years have been
standing room only in the GHQ and
everyone has had a blast,” said
Darrell. “It’s great that we can
make money for MS and have a
good time in doing so.”

Last year the contest raised
$1,130, all of which was donated
toward research about multiple sclero-

In response to Phi Kap’s propo-
sed new pledge program, new Pi
Kappa Alpha Vice President Richard
Perry said, “With the changes going
on at PiKA and W&L, Brooks (Pe-

provided us with good alternatives for
our pledge program.

“I was glad to see that Phi Kap
took the lead in changing old atti-
tudes about hazing and pledgeship,”
Perry said.

Atkins agreed and said,“I think
it's heading in the right direction.”

“I appreciate the image they're
trying to change. Other fraternities
should try to change as well,” Atkins
said.

Barnes speaks of new political era

By Carrie Davis
Staff Reporter

Nationally known political com-
mentator and senior editor of The
New Republic magazine Fred Barnes
spoke in Lee Chapel Tuesday on ‘the
emergence of a new political era.

Barnes’ said that since the
Iran-Contra hearings in 1987, the
Washington political arena has be-
come mundane. Politicians now con-
cern themselves with social issues
such as the War on Drugs or envi-
ronmental developments like the
Clean Air Act, he said.

Barnes said that President George
Bush’s policies are symptoms, rather
than causes, of this new era. Unlike

president. He works longer hours than
Reagan but does not make himself as
visible to the public. These are all
characteristics of the new, gentle
politics.

The attitude manifests itself in
four ways, according to Barnes.
‘~ The fmstris-the” decrease in‘ gov-
ernment spending. Concem of the
federal deficit in the 1980's caused
the government to eliminate several
programs, including catastrophic
health care. Military spending on the
Strategic Defense Initiative and the
space program has also been cut.

The second is the acceptance of
big government. Regardless of what
people think, Barnes said, “Ameri-
cans like big govemment.” He added
that he did not anticipate any pro-

grams that Reagan failed to eliminate
would be cut in the future. Ironically,
Reagan added to the acceptance of
big government by calling attention to
Washington.

The third characteristic of the new
era is the decline of anti-Communist

sentiment. Barnes called the recent

events in Eastern Europe "the greatest
democratic awakening in history.” He
listed his reasons for the fall of Com-
munism.

Barnes claimed that the Soviets
could not compete with American
military technology. This clash cul-
minated in the invasion of Grenada.

He also said that the Soviet sys-
tem simply did not work. Innovations
never caught on, causing a drastic
decline in the economy.

The election of a Polish Pope was
also a major factor in the rejection of
Communism in Eastern Europe. Pope
John Paul II campaigned for the
Solidarity movement in Poland and
even threatened to visit and rally the
people if the Soviets rejected the
establishment of the: labor union.

When the Pope declared that
Communism and Christianity are
incompatible, the Polish youth used
the church as a haven, according to
Barnes.

The people received support from
radio broadcasts such as Radio Free
Europe and the Voice of America and
were led by decisive men such as
Lech Walesa who knew when to act,
Barnes said.

Additionally, Phi Kap’s new food
program was outlined by chapter
advisor Jerry Darrell at the workshop.
Darrell said the food at Phi Kap has
improved and become more diverse
while the budget has been reduced
greatly.

Last year Phi Kap saved $31,331
in the first year of the program,
Darrell said. He said Phi Kap bud-
geted so well in the months of Sep-
tember through November that there
was no food charge for the month of
December. Currently each brother
pays $20.88 a month to eat at Phi
kap, Darrell said.

Junior Phi Kap Mark Monahan
said he has seen the quality of food
improve over the past year.

“Hopefully the workshop helped

Darrell also said he believes the

fraternity is the first to set up retire-
ment funds for its current and past
employees. The fraternity is now
raising and near a goal of $24,000
for a retirement fund for its current
employees, Darrell said.

Pettus also outlined Phi Kap’s
new leadership and administrative
techniques at the workshop. An Exec-
utive Board was created, consisting of
the fratemity’s top officers.

“If people got just one thing out
of the program, I’ll be happy,” Pet-
tus said after the workshop.

Generals make it four straight over RC  

V By Jay Plotkln
" Sports Editor

They say the storm is worst before the calm.
For the Washington and Lee basketball team, all may
; not be calm yet, but it seems they have weathered their
. worst performance in two seasons without too much
harm.
. After looking terrible in a 67-66 loss to Bridgewater,
. the Generals bounced back in front of the home folks in
the annual tussle with arch rival Roanoke.

After the poor defensive performance against Bridge-
water, which head coach Verne Canﬁeld called the worst
he has seen in his life, he felt a little better after the
Roanoke win. “Their team defense was better. They still
aren’t off the hook. They have got to play team defense
on the road and they .have got to stop people from
penetrating. Roanoke penetrated way too much against us,
and weicannot allow that.”

Most of the Generals defensive success came from
their 2-3 match-up zone. Said Cariﬁeld, “We were only
going to use it for one or two possessions, but it was
working and [junior guard] Michael [Holton] kept calling
it. After about seven or eight trips, they took a time out
to try to solve it.”

W&L opened up an early lead as Holton and junior
backcourt mate Jim Casey opened the game with three-
point goals. The three-point goal would turn out to be
W&L’s best friend in the ﬁrst half, as the Generals made
six of 11. Ironically enough, the team, though shooting
better than 50 percent from outside, made only 37
percent overall in the ﬁrst half.

The Generals trailed 13-11 before Casey and freshman
Bryan Watkins each buried tliree-point goals sandwiched
around sophomore forward John Witherington’s rebound
tip-in to give the Generals a 19-13 lead.

The lead grew to 10 when junior front court players
hooked up for a basket, Craig Hatfield scoring off a feed
from Chris Jacobs. Roanoke closed to 38-37 behind the
play of transfers Rodney Spickard (Emory & Henry) and
Joe McDowell (Navy), but Holton nailed another three-
pointer to give W&L a 41-39 halftime lead.

The second half was almost a direct contrast to the
ﬁrst for W&L. The Generals concentrated on getting the
ball inside to start the half, and they did so to perfection.
Hatﬁeld and Jacobs scored the first six baskets of the
second half, including a dunk over a Roanoke player by
Jacobs.

Of their first 22 second-half points, 20 came from the
inside players. Jacobs, Hatﬁeld and sophomore Courtney
Penn led the way with six each during the rim. The
inside play sparked the Generals to 58 percent shooting
in the second half.

With W&L leading 63-54, Roanoke went on a 14-8
run to cut the lead to just one at 71-70 with just over
four minutes left. Holton answered with a three-pointer

The Fling-tum Phl, January 18, 1990

 

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee men’s
swimming team improved their record
to 5-3 with a 101-91 upset win over
the College of Charleston on Sunday
afternoon at Cy Twombly pool.

“It was a tough, exhausting day,"
said head coach Page Rerriillard.
“But our men were up to the chal-
lenge in the events we needed to
win.”

The men's victory was particularly 2

impressive considering that the squad
has only nine swimmers. Senior All-
American Dave Olson, who injured
an elbow in early December, did not
swim in Sunday’s meet.

“The men’s team, despite being
low on numbers, continues to come
together and do what it takes to get
the job done,” Remillard said.

The key race for the Generals was
sophomore Stuart Towns’ victory in
the 200-yard breaststroke.

“He’s been working on that
stroke. It was a must for us and he
accomplished it,” said Reriiillard.

The win by Towns, whose fmish-

. ing time of 2:22.28 was a lifetime

best, set the stage for W&L’s first-
place finish in the 400-yard freestyle
relay, which gave the Generals their
ﬁfth victory of the season.

VV&L's relay team ﬁnished with a

WRESTLE

” from page 6

time of 3:21.49, beating Charleston
by 11 seconds.

In addition to Towns, three other
sophomores, Doug Brown, Jay Smith
and Chip Nordhoff earned ﬁrst-place
ﬁnishes.

“Doug Brown did a really good
job,” Remillard said.

Brown ﬁnished ﬁrst in the 200-
yard ﬂy (2:07.86) and the 1000-yard
freestyle ( 10:12.30).

Smith won the 50 and 100-yard
freestyle events (21.93-, 47.74), while
Nordhoff claimed ﬁrst-place in the
00-yard freestyle with a time of
1:48.80.

Sunday’s victory came on the
heels of a 111-72 loss to Ship-
pensburg last Wednesday night.
Smith, who won the 50 and 100-
yard freestyle races (21.67, 47.96),
provided the only two victories for
W&L in that meet.

This Saturday the Generals will
swim against Georgetown at 1 p.m.
in Twombly Pool. A W&L victory
would equal the tearn’s 1988-89
record of 6-3.

“They're a large squad,” Remil-
lard said of Georgetown. “It’ll be a
challenge for us, but we should swim
well.

“We have to keep getting faster,
because our opponents are going to
keep getting stronger.”

_ at 190 pounds the key to the match.

Selway is yet another W&L fresh-
man.

The Generals grabbed another
quick six points when freshman Doug
Lamb recorded a pin 2:19 into his
134-pound bout.

After senior co-captain Lee Gar-

-- love lost his 142-pound bout 6-4,

freshman 150-pounder Cary Potts
needed just 1:21 to pin his opponent.
158-pound freshman Ryland Scott
followed his teammate Potts and took
a slightly longer 2:00 to record a fall
of his own. -

Soderberg and freshman Andrew
Tucker both lost, but Selway then
recorded his forfeit victory at 190
pounds. Freshman John Conkling
dropped an 11-5 decision at heavy-
weight to complete the scoring.

Looking down the road, the team
will travel to the Newport News
Apprentice Invitational this weekend.
Franke is excited about this upcoming
tournament as the Generals will face
some of their best competition of the
year. Frarike is looking for success
not only from the upperclassmen but

 forwsorrie freshmen to place as well.

Having captured the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference championship
for the last two years, the Washing-
ton and Lee women's swim team is
starting to look outside the conference
for wins against different competition.

The team has yet to win a non-
ODAC meet this season, but, as head
coach Page Rerriillard points out,
having not beaten a non-conference
foe is not a reﬂection on this team’s
potential.

“We had an option, and we chose
to emphasize our ODAC performance.
Also, the women are swimming the
men's schedule. The issue is not that
they are unable to beat anyone out-
side the ODAC," said Remillard.

Last weekend, the Generals were
challenged from the get-go against
the College of Charleston. Although
W&L came up on the short end of
the score, there were several ﬁne
performances, most notably from
sophomore Jodi Herring and freshman
Christine Gorman.

Herring ﬁnished in second place
in the 500-freestyle but dropped ﬁve
seconds off her previous best time in
the event. She swam a strong race in
the underdog role. Gorman won both

§W&L ‘swimming tough’

the 200-butterﬂy and the 1,000-free-
style events.

According to Remillard, Gorman
1S contributing increasingly more to
the whole output of the team with
every week.

Remillard also acknowledged
weaknesses in the W&L swims
against Charleston, but did not con-
vey much disappointment. “The team
as a whole did not put together a
consistent performance. One event we
swam well, the next we were off.
Then in the next one we redeemed
ourselves. We need to work a little
on concentration, but I’m still very
enthusiastic,” said the eleventh-year
head coach. 1

This weekend W&L runs into a
strong Georgetown team. Remillard is
looking for good individual perform-
ances. Practice time this week has
been devoted to training solely for
the Georgetown meet.

Said Remillard, “The women are
working as a team to win their first
non-conference meet — they have just
that one goal in mind."

The meet will be held Saturday in
Twombly Pool starting at 1:00.

The old track around Wilson Fieldhas been replaced by a new Versiturf

track. Finishing touches are being added now. File photo.

New track completed;
needs finishing touch

By Blair Simmons
Staff Reporter

The men’s and women's track
teams will go first class this season
on the new $250,000 track around
Wilson Field, said Associate Athletic
Director Richard Miller.

President John Wilson and the
Board of Trustees approved funding
for the track last spring, following an
eight year campaign by Capital Proj-
ects, the uriiversity’s organization
which solicits funds for construction
projects.

Work on the track began in mid-
July and was to be completed by
Sept. 16. The surface was completed
on Nov. 24 and the finishing touches,
lines and an aluminum curb around
the inside of the track, will be com-
pleted in upcoming weeks, said Mill-
er.

Delay and cost over-riins were
caused in part by large amounts of
stone which had to be excavated to
accommodate the track’s drainage
system, said Miller. Blasting was not
an option because the stadium is
embedded in rock.

The old drainage system zig-zag-
ged under the northern half of the
football ﬁeld at depths ranging from
eight to 20 feet, making it difﬁcult to
ﬁnd. It is attached to the new system
at the comer of the ﬁeld by the
stadium.

The new drainage system goes
around the,_inside of the track and has
an additional pipe running along the

front of the stadium to handle heavy
run-off.

The drains are circular gates that
have the special feature of being able
to lock down Astroturf. This option
would make a future decision to put
Astroturf on the ﬁeld cheaper and
much more convenient. Miller said
the athletic department has no such
plans presently.

“We haven't even really looked
into Astroturf. We have other projects
that are more important and there are
a lot advantages and disadvantages to
Astroturf that must be considered,”
said Miller.

Astroturf causes more abrasions,
high-speed injuries and synthetic
material deterioration than does grass,
he said. It also lasts only about ten
years in outdoor stadiums.

The Versiturf surface on the track,
high-jump pit and pole-vault runway
is the most expensive brand on the
market and has a ﬁve-year rriinimurn,
ten-year maximum no maintenance
warranty, said Miller.

Made with Eurothane, the half-
inch surface is full-deptli color and
should not crack or show gouges or
ruts, Miller said.

It is the same type of surface
used at the 1984 Olympics in Los
Angeles. “It’s a super track, state-
of-the—art. It could be the best track
in existence today,” said Jolm Tuck-
er, the women’s track coach.

The Fling-tum Phi, January 18, 1990

The Fi’ing—z‘um Phi picks the best books of the set;

By Chris Swann
Staff Reviewer

The 1980s saw the rise of several
prominent authors and the continuing
success of many others. While not a
great decade from a major literary
point of view, many good novels and
short stories were written. I've
made, based on my own reading
experience, a list of ten good books
from the 80s.

People always ask me, "What’s
a good book to read?" or, "Is this
author any good?" I can only point
out things about a book that I think
make it good; you have to read it to
discover if it's "good" or not. Many
professors in the English Department
may cringe at the choices I’ve made,
and professional book critics might
howl in outrage at some of the works
zrs.well. As my defense, I will say
that I chose the books based on their
popularity, how well-written and
entertaining the stories were, and any
possible impact ,on or representation
of current literature and life in the.
1980s they may have had. Enter-
tainment is the key word, a book
that is entertaining and has some
literary value is, to me, a very good
book. If you're looking for a good
book, here are ten of them.~ Check
them out.

10.Liar's Poker by Michael Lew-
is, 1989. A hilarious portrayal of life
on Wall Street as the author becomes
a hireling in the prestigious ﬁrm ol
Salomon Brothers and writes of the
action behind closed doors: the exem-
ciating ﬁve-month training program,
the embarrassing first few days on
the trading ﬂoor, "blowing up" (ﬁnan-
cially ruining) clients by mistake, the
awesome amounts of money one can
make for picking up a phone, and the
ever-popular game of "Liar’s Poker"
played in one form or another by
everyone on Wall Street. Lewis
writes in a witty and very perceptive
tone as he describes the chaotic and
health-threatening existence on Ameri-
ca’s ﬁnancial center and the processes
of getting into, surviving through, and
getting out of the richest game in
town. A must for business or eco-
nomics majors, and very entertaining
and educational for anyone with a
mild interest in Wall Street.

9. Night Shift by Stephen King.
1978. I know, this wasn’t written in
the 80s. However, it represents the
writing style of America's premier
master of horror better than most of
his major works which he wrote in
the past decade. Edgar Allen Poe in
his essay “The Poetic Principle” said
that fiction (in his case as in King’s,
horror or the macabre) was best
written so as to produce a singular,
powerful effect on the reader in one
sitting. King does a magniﬁcent job
with this collection of short stories by
creating fiction in the tradition of
Poe. Over twenty stories are in-
cluded: a tale, written entirely in
letter form, about a haunted house

and its equally haunted and evil ,

town; an English teacher who calls
upon supernatural powers to combat
students in his class who have been
dead for years; a tormented man who
consults a psychiatrist about a "bo-
geyman" who has followed him for
years; a Kansas town taken over by
a twisted fundamentalist cult of
youngsters (eventually made into the
movie Children of the Corn); a bi-

_zarre service that guarantees to get
‘you to quit smoking (or else); an

even more bizarre service that will
mow your lawn in rriinutes using a
very strange method - the list goes
on and on. This is a great book for
people who don't have the time to
read an entire novel and who love
suspense, mystery and terror. It even
works for those people who claim
that they don't like or even believe in
tliesupernatural; still, is that really
just a shadow in the comer...

Other books by Stephen King:
Cujo, The Dark Tower series.

8. Gorky Park by Martin Cruz
Smith, 1981. A gritty, dark yet often
humorous novel which deals with a
Moscow investigator‘s attempt to
solve a triple murder. The opening
scene in Gorky Park with Arkady
Renko, the investigator, standing over
three frozen corpses, sans ﬁngers or
faces courtesy of a rather sharp knife,
sets the tone of this portrayal of
Russian life and the Moscow police.
Smith wrote this best-seller about a
country whose lifestyle was totally
alien to the West in 1981 before
glasnost and opened many eyes to
thecomplexities of Moscow’s envi-
ronment and the strangeness (com-
pared to the United States’s) of a
Russian's daily life. ' Oddly enough,
the bad guy is a rich, powerful
American, but he is not a stereotypi-
cal greedy millionaire, just as Renko
is not a stereotypical Russian, and the
reader ﬁnds himself totally on the
side of this Soviet cop who is be-
coming disenchanted with his life and
the Soviet system. The KGB agent
Pribluda and the dissident Irina, with
whom Renko falls in love with, are
somewhat stereotyped, but this fact is
usually hidden by the masterful writ-
ing of Smith. Renko’s sometime
partnership with the American Irish

cop Kirwill and the climatic chase in * -

New York City are told through the
eyes of a Soviet citizen who makes
the Big Apple look dark and foreign
and...capitalist. It works. A book
for serious readers who enjoy sus-
pense and serious plots.

Other books by Smith: Polar Star
(the sequel to Gorky Park).

7. Batman: The Dark Knight Re-
turns by Frank Miller, 1986. OK,
you've seen Adam West in tights on
TV, Michael Keaton in black on the
big screen, and you're sick of the
hoopla and publicity behind the
Caped Crusader. Worse, this work is
in comic book form. Before you
throw away this article in disgust.
read on further. This is a look at a
comic book hero that has never been
done before. Miller does an incredi-
ble job of portraying a world in the
very near future of slums, decaying
cities and urban riots which desper-
ately cries out for a hero and a repre-
sentative of justice, a value that
seems to have been thrown out of the
window. Alas, millionaire Bruce
Wayne has hung up his cowl anti
been retired from crime ﬁghting for
ten years after Robin was killed by
the Joker (now languishing in an
asylum), swearing never again to be
Batman. However, the return of
Harvey Dent, better known as the
criminal Two-Face, and his attempt to
ransom Gotham City for ntillions
prompts Wayne to don his costume
once again. The plot continues as
the now nearly sixty year old Batman
must combat an urban gang known
as the Mutants and finally face his
nemesis the Joker, all amid loud
protests and support alike for the
Batman from the public and police.
Superman is also present in an un-

likely role as an agent of the United
States government, and he too must
face the Batman. Sound silly? Take
one look at the graphics. They are
dark, more realistic portraits rather
than the colorful graphics that are
now found on comic book racks.
The story is grimmer, and Miller
makes age a factor as Batman ntust
deal with his mortality, unlike m()sl
comic book heroes who remain per-
petually in their late twenties and are
usually dead only temporarily. The
myth behind the Batman is as large
as ever, showing his origin and even
giving him scenes on horseback that
evoke images of King Arthur's
knights and of the lone cowboy hero
at high noon. This was the first oi‘
the "graphic novels" that appeared in
the 19803, and concerns a man who,
as Alan Moore states in the prologue,
teeters on the line between "a con-
cerned do-gooder and a revcnge—driv-

5. The Bourne Identity by Robert
Ludlum, 1980. This author is the
unsurpassed writer of thrillers and
complex plots dealing with business,
governments and espionage. As the

jacket cover reads, "Robert Ludlum is’

the author of thirteen novels pub-
lished in thirty-two languages and
twentv-seven countries with world-
wide sales in excess of one hundred
sixty million copies." Enough said
for the author’s ability. This novel
(recently done as a TV rriini-series
with Richard Chamberlain) concerns
Jason Boume, a man who escapes a
ship foundering in a Mediterranean
storm with several bullet wounds, two
in his head. When he wakes up days
later in a tiny village on the French
coast, he has no recollection of who
he is or what he does, and a bit of
microﬁlm surgically implanted in his
hip is his only clue. It leads him to
a bank account in Zurich containing
millions and to mysterious men who
are determined to kill this man who
knows neither his crime or his identi-
ty other than his narne.This is a
suspenseful, labyrinthine, action-

4. The Hunt For Red October by
Tom Clancy, 1984. This novel
started the incredible career of novel-
ist Tom Clancy, a former insurance
salesman who gave up his career for
novels. Thank God. This man can
tell a great story, and he relies on the
American fascination with technology
and how things work in this high-
tech, seafaring story about a defecting
Soviet supersub. CIA analyst Jack
Ryan is thrown into "the field" to
prove his theory that the maverick
Soviet Captain Marko Rarnius intends
to defect with the Soviet Navy's
finest sub, Red October. Both the‘
United States and the Soviet Union’s
navies are searching for the sub, and
tensions rim high in this complex
story of defection, espionage, military
power and intrigue written by Ameri-
ca’s newest great writer. The descrip-
tions of submarine combat, naval
operations and high-tech equipment
are corriplicated, although enthralling
and totally realistic. Clancy used
information from naval sources avail-
able to the general public to create
this story, ﬁlling in the gaps with his
own active imagination. Clancy's
knowledge of the Soviet government
and military rriind is so great that he
is reported to be a consultant for the
United States Central Intelligence
Agency. Regardless, he knows his
stuff in this novel.

3. The Lords of Discipline by Pat
Conroy, 1982. Pat Conroy is_ one of
the South's great authors from both
an entertainment perspective and a
literary one. His writing ﬂows with
the rich descriptions of the South
Carolina port of Charleston and with
the internal tiirmoils his characters
must face. In this novel, arguably
his best, his hero Will McLean, a
senior cadet at the ﬁctional Carolina
Military Institute (created from the
examples of The Citadel, West Point
and VMI), must in 1966 make sure
the Iristitute’s first black cadet gets a
fair chance to make it through the
Plebe System of hazing. Racial
prejudices and Will’s own anti-hero-
ical attitude make his task difﬁcult.
Will is one of Conroy's most power-
ful characters, a man who must come
to terms with the meaning of honor,
friendship, pride, injustice, and the
Vietnam War, while he combats an
elite and mysterious group of cadets
known only as "The Ten." He con-
fronts his own sexuality as he falls in
love with a haunting yet beautiful
girl. Passion and betrayal run deep in
this novel, and the mythical proper-
ties of the Old South and a corrupt
military academy are brought to shin-
ing life by Conroy. One of the most
powerful books that I have ever read.

2. Lonesome Dove by Ilarry
McMurtry, 1985. The epic Pulitzer
Prize-winriing novel of the Old West
and an amazing cattle drive up to
Montana from the town of Lonespme
Dove in south Texas. McMurtry has
created some of the richest characters '
in his brilliant career: Augustus
McCrae, an ornery, brave and caring
ex-Texas Ranger who lightens these I
pages with his wit and acti ns;
Woodrow Call, the head of the Hat
Creek Outﬁt who hides his ow
private demons as he leads his men
north to Montana; Lorena Woodfthe
beautiful blonde whore who is s.ap- ,
tured by Indians and, unbelievably,
falls in love; Jake Spoon, maveiick ‘
gambler and a man on the run ,l‘or

Montana and rides to a terrible late;
Newt, the young cowhand eager‘ to
prove himself to his idol, Captain .
Call; Blue Duck, a renegade Indian
who teirorizes the land the Hat Creek
company must ride through; and The
Boys, the young men who take ton
Call’s offer to ride north and follow
him and McCrae through stampcdcs,
storms and Indians in this masterpigcc
of the American Frontier. A rich anti
descriptive work of a time and‘ (1
culture that has always fascinated t'he ‘
American public.

1. Bright Lights, Big City by Jay
Mclnemey, 1984. Forget the horriirlc
ﬁlm starring Michael J. Fox (which I

have never seen but heard it mostly é. ,

consisted of a badly miscast stpr""'
snorting an incredible amount o
cocaine). This book is both a litcrair}
and entertaining masterpiece. Dar
humor is the order of the day as’
young man, remaining unnamed, livt.
in a whirlwind life of nightclub
editorial ofﬁces, parties and, yes,
cocaine as he attempts to "outstrip
mortality" as the book cover suggests
and find some meaning to his bizarre,
nearly out-of—control life. Mclnemcy
uses the second person style of point
of view, substituting "I" with "you‘
in order to further draw the readc;
into this amazing novel. The author
‘depicts the New York life of Hit?
-1980s unerringly: materialism, greed,
drugs, sex, and the party scene are
described in a witty, cynical, and
often hilarious tone as the "hero" oi,"
the story is drawn into the chaotic
life he leads by his best friend and‘
his own misfortune. We recognize,‘
the man's disintegrating morals yet
immediately sympathize with him as‘
he searches to ﬁnd out who he really
is and answer the question found in
the prologue: which is worse, living»
an illusion or losing it? The novel is

not very long, permitting people with""

little time for 500+ page books to;
read and enjoy this fascinating story.

In twenty years, this novel will be’

“Moscow

afis left

_:behind’

I

By Max Gan
.‘Speclal to the Phi

4

Moscow is left behind with its
‘crowded streets, with empty shelves
‘in its stores and long lines of people,

with all the problems that the human
‘mind can ever think of. Here I am in
(America, after carpets of red tape and
ten thousand kilometers of traveling,
«answering thousands of questions,
while at the same time, hearing a lot
'of unpleasant things about my coun-
dry. I am trying to stay in good spir-
its and preserve some sense of hu-
‘mot, although I am having night-
,mares in Russian and daydreams in
English -— in other words, being a
‘Russian exchange student.

' As a Soviet foreign exchange
student, I constantly am asked the
«following questions:

0 How’s Gorbi ?

- How do you like perestroika?

5 ° What year is it in the Soviet
Union?
‘ - I’ve heard the food there is
Junky?

- Is it mandatory to be a member
tof the Communist party?

- You don’t have any religion, do
‘you?

v - Do you really want to conquer
us? »
‘ ' What do people drink: coffee,
tea or just vodka?

Such questions have their own
personality; they are different, just

8' like the people who ask them. Some

are humorous and friendly, some
stupid and annoying, and some are
tiresome and exhausting.
After a few months I really be-
came a “KGB question addict.”
Sometimes the day even seemed
gloomy if I did not hear the farriiliar
words. After being asked for approxi-
ately the 100th time if I were a
GB agent, I decided to go along
with the joke and give everybody a
positive answer. If I had only thought
i ‘of the consequences! The next thing
‘I heard was: “We knew it all
. along!" No matter what the questions
'are, one can feel that attitudes to-

§

The Rlng-tum Phl, January 18, 1990

ward Soviets have changed during the
past few years. It seems to me that
most people feel that we are no
longer “the bad,” although we are
not “the good” either. Where do we
fit in? To most people Russians still
looks exotic, even though we are
ordinary human beings without horns
and tails, have children and even
hangovers. As well, strong feelings of
cautiousness and carefulness always
seem to be present when they
encounter Soviets. People tend to
keep a certain distance in relations
with “the Russians.”

I think that the time has come to
change the current situation and try
to keep politics out of the relations
between people. Who knows that the
Red Square is named so not because
the Soviet Union is a communist
country, but because the word “red”
in old Russian language meant
“beautiful?” ( I don’t think many
people do.)

Americans should know that the
harsh, cold image of Siberia is not
necessarily that of the entire Soviet
Union. People go there mostly be-
cause they want to and maybe love
the beautiful landscape.

Also, people in the Soviet Union
should understand that if a person in
the USA goes on a hunger strilte, it
is not necessarily a protest against
government policy, but a way to lose
some weight.

Years of propaganda and mutual
distrust between nations have done
their deed. Situations in which simply
the mention of the Soviet Union has
an effect on people equal to that of

red color on a raging bull, are rare,
but still many tend to associate the
word “Russian” with something
suspicious.

What really amazes me is that
people do not even bother to ﬁnd out
what the “truth” about the Soviet
Union is. Some people do not really
know anything about the Soviet
Union. You can summarize their
knowledge with the words “winter,
KGB, perestroika, glasnost, vodka,
caviar."

Of course, I am far from blaming
only the American side for this situa-
tion. Probably in most cases it is our
fault. We have problems (who
doesn't ?) and deserve criticism, but
criticism that is based on sound argu-
ments and facts, not on quicksand.

Stereotypes are the enormous
barriers that we must overcome. And
we can only do it together. The Iron
Curtain was built not only between
the nations but between individuals
also. Even though this barrier is not
made of stainless steel and is getting
rusty now, we have a long way to go
to dismantle it completely. It is unfair
that our people have been deprived of
the opportunity to communicate with
each other, and denied the access to
other cultures for decades. It is time
to turn from the age of the cold war
to the age of discovery. Already
what was unthinkable a year ago
today is becoming routine.

The interest in the USSR is
growing. I just hope that it is not a
trend that will come and go. After
all, aren’t our nations making the
political weather all over the world?

Rising soprano to perform

From the W&L News Office

Dawn Upshaw, a rising young
soprano at the Metropolitan Opera
and other international opera com-
panies, will perform at Washington
and Lee University Tuesday, Jan. 23.

She will be aocompariied by Mar-
go Garret, one of today's leading
collaborative pianists.

Selections to be performed by
Upshaw are Henry Purcell’s “The

Blessed Virgin's Expostulation
(1963)", five pieces by Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart, “Sieben fruhe

Lieder” (1908) by Alban Berg, Frari-
cis Pou1enc’s “Financailles pour rire"
(1939), and six selections by Samuel
Barber.

With engagements at the Metropo-
litan Opera, the Salzbburg Festival,
the Aix-en-Provence Festival, and
many international orchestras and
recital stages, Upshaw is becoming
known throughout the world.

Recently her schedule has in-
cluded concerts with the Kronos

Quartet and appearances with the
orchestras of SC Louis, Boston and
Minnesota, and opera engagements in
Vienna and Hamburg. In March she
will sing the role of Zerlina in Fran-
co Zeffere1li’s new production of
Mozart’s Don Giovanni, conducted by
James Levine, at the Metropolitan
Opera.

Born in Nashville and raised in
Illinois, Upshaw graduated from Il-
linois Wesleyan University and con-
tinued her vocal studies at the Man-
hattan School of Music.

In 1984, at the beginning of her
career, she won the Young Concert
Artist lntemational Auditions, and in
the same year joined the Metropolitan
Opera's Young Artists Development
Program. She made her Metropolitan
Opera debut as the Countess Ceprano
in Rigoletto during the 1984-85 sea-
son.
In 1987-88, in addition to ap-
pearances at the Metropolitan Opera,
Upshaw sang with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic in Maliler’s Second
Symphony under Zubin Mehta, sang

her first performances with Nikolaus
Hamoncourt and the Concentus Mus-
icus in Bach's Christmas Oratorio in
Vienna, appeared with New York's
Chamber Music Society of Lincoln
Center, and made a coast-to-coast

"recital tour with presenters including

Washington's Library of Congress,
Minneapolis’ Schubert Club, Chicago
Arts Club, and Los Angeles Ambas-
sador Foundation.

Upshaw has numerous recordings,
some forthcoming on Nonesuch,
Telarc, Deutch Grarrirnophon, and
EM} labels.

On Wednesday, Jan. 24, Upshaw
will conduct a master class in Lee
Chapel which will begin at 10:30
a.m. All interested auditors are wel-
gome to attend free of charge.

The concert, which is sponsored
by the W&L Concert Guild, will
begin at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel. Tick-
ets will be available at the door.
Admission is $6 for adults, $4 for
senior citizens‘ and non-W&L stu-
dents, and free to the W&L com-

George McNeil to exhibit art

From the W&L News Office

Paintings and lithographs by fa-
mous American artist George McNeil
will be on exhibit in duPont Gallery
Jan. 15 - Feb. 16. A lecture and
reception for McNeil will be held in
the gallery Ian. 30 at 7 p.m.

The exhibits at W&L will include
four large oil paintings, painted be-
tween 1984 and 1988, and 20 litho-
graphs dated 1974-1985.

McNeil has been called the “Mas-
ter of American Expressionism, be-
longing to the generation of William
deKooning, Franz Kline, Jackson
Pollock and Phillip Guston.” He has
been painting for over 50 years, one
of the original abstract expressionists
of the 1950s, and has never given up
his expressionistic mode.

McNeil’s large paintings of the
1960s and 1970s are mostly abstract-
ed landscapes and simplified single
ﬁgures. In the 1980s, he began using

narrative subject matter pertaining to

contemporary culture -— punk rockers, ‘

discos, pop singers, graffiti and foot-
ball players. He calls these subjects
a “celebration of freedom." His
most recent work deals with the
madness of city life. His paintings,
which have a strong psychological
twist, are vividly bold, and the tex-
ture rich with overlays, scrapings and
scumblings.

McNeil was born in 1908 in New
York. In 1926, he entered the gener-
al art program at Pratt Institute in
Brooklyn, beginning his lifelong
dedication to painting, drawing and
teaching. From 1930-31, he studied
at the Art Students League, and from
1932-36, he studied with Hans Hoff-
marm. He joined the Navy in 1943.

After World War H, McNeil re-
turned to Pratt as director of the
evening school, where he taught from
1948 until 1981. While at Pratt, he
brought in numerous well-known
artists among them Guston, Kline,
Adolph, Gottlieb, Jimmy Ernst and

Milton Resnick. McNeil has also
taught at the New York Studio
School and has served as visiting
artist at American University (Wash-
ington, D.C.)

Since 1941, McNeil has had over
30 one—person exhibitions in museums
and galleries across the country,
including the Museum of Modern
Art, the Whitney Museum, the Gug-
genheirn, the Corcoran Gallery, the
San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art, and the Chicago Art Institute.
His paintings are in the permanent
collections of many of these muse-
ums, and in university collections
across the country.

McNeil recently was awarded the
first Richard Koopman Distinguished
Chair in the Visual Arts at the Han-
ford Art School of the University of
Hartford. He has also received the
National Institute of Arts and Letters
Award, the American Academy of
Arts and Letters Award, a Guggen-
heim Fellowship, and a National
Council on the Arts Award.

  because ALL Fiatcniities
oppose racism!

Racism has no place in the fraternity
experience.

It is counter to everything fraternities stand
for. It does not encourage bonds of friendship
based upon individual merit and achievement.’ It
does not demonstrate leadership. It does not
prove an individual’s or a group’s superior
qualifications in any way.

We, the men's general fraternities united in the
National lnterfratemity Conference, are dedi-
cated and determined to deal with racism.

We stand united in our affirmation of basic
standards of human behavior.

We instill the principles of diligence, honor,
integrity. virtue, duty and respect for human
dignity. - '

Consider these facts:

- Although 35 years have passed since the Su-
preme C ourt's historic‘ decision striking down
racially segregated school systems, the major-
ity of our colleges and universities are still
predominantly segregated by race.

- Despite the passage ofa quarter century since
the Civil Rights Act was enacted by the U.S.
Congress constant vigilance is still required to
assure all our citizens equal treatment under
the law.

- As the country's population grows, new mi-
norities such as Asians and Hispanics are
beginning to experience the frustrations and
outrages of prejudice once reserved for Irish.
German, Polish, Roman Catholic or African
Americans.

- By the year 2020 about 40% ofAmerica’s
workforce will be comprised of African-
Americans. Asians, Hispanics, and North
American Indians.

This is what we’re doing about it:

- The spirit of brotherhood knows no color,
creed, religion or national origin; we are
working actively to promote cultural, religious
and racial diversity in our memberships and
will oppose acts of racism.

- Fraternities seek excellence wherever it may
be found and seek to educate members that
those who discriminate on the basis of race
defraud only themselves.

- Through leadership opportunities, cooperative
governing, service and social eﬁforts, frater-
nity chapters of diﬂering memberships are-
providing every day learning experiences
which combat racism.

- We believe the strength and success of Amer-
ica's future will rest on cultural and racial
diversity built on the high moral standards of
virtue, diligence and integrity exemplified by
the Fraternity experience; we expect Fraterni-
ties to grow and build on that diversity also.

Violation of our standards leads to swift and
certain sanctions: ranging from directives to
probation to suspension to expulsion —— even to
revocation of charter and dissolution of chapter.
We’re serious about racism and we think you
ought to know it.

If you think a brother's qualifications can be
judged on the color of his skin, hair or eyes, the
religion of his parents, or the homeland of his
ancestors then you’ve missed a great lesson fra-
temities have to offer. But if you’re interested in
finding out how the leaders of tomorrow can
experience the value of brotherhood based on
mutual respect and admiration for individual
achievement then write to us at the Fraternity
Executives Association, 3901 W. 86th St, Suite
390, Indianapolis, IN 46268.

We’re in the business of developing leaders
with integrity: brotherhood is an essential ingre-
dient.

Washington and Lee, cancelling all
rush activities for the rest of the
week.

After meeting with the Panhellenic

the PHC agreed that greater interest
and numbers are needed to form a
strong chapter.

“Delta Gamma does not want to

Despite the controversy over Delta

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

From the W&L News Office

The last portrait painted of
Gen. Robert E. Lee during his life-
time — one of only three such
paintings — came home Friday for
the general’s 184th birthday.

The painting, by Swiss artist
Frank Buchser, will hang perma-
nently in the Swiss Embassy in
Washington, D.C. A reception,
hosted by Swiss ambassador
Eduoard Brunner for the Washing-
ton chapter of the W&L Alumni
Association, took place Friday at
the embassy.

According to Charles Bracelen
Flood, author of Lee.‘ The Last
Years, a group of Swiss liberals
decided to commission a painting
to celebrate the Union victory in
the Civil War. The painting was to
hang in the Swiss parliament build-
ing in Beme.

Buchser, a piano-maker-tum-
ed-artist whose reputation for
brawling and wornanizing often got
him in trouble in his homeland,
grabbed the chance to travel
abroad. He travelled to the United
States, where he painted the por-
traits of President Andrew John-
son, Secretary of State William H.
Seward and Gen. William Tecum-
seh Sherman.

Buchser’s patrons wanted a
painting of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant,
but Grant had repeatedly refused to

Housing law
to hit students

Some landlords will face
permit hearing, stricter rules

By Andrew Waters
Staff Reporter

Some Washington and Lee stu-
dents who live in a house or apart-
ment in town with more than four
people may have to ﬁnd somewhere
else to live next year.

Under a Lexington city ordinance,
landlords with large capacity houses
will need to have a conditional use
permit after July in order to house
more than four unrelated people
under the same roof.

To qualify for the perrriit, houses
will have to meet public health,
safety and welfare requirements under
a standard Building Ofﬁcials & Code
Administrators regulation.

Houses must also have at least
one bedroom for each occupant and
no more than 10 occupants.

In addition, property owners will
be required to provide adequate park-
ing, landscaping, buffers and fences
to “mitigate potentially negative
impacts” on adjoining properties.

“If a house is in good physical

create a problem unless he is denied
a conditional use permit by the city.

“The only problem it's going to
be is if there are a lot of people who
oppose this at the public hearing,”
Steanis said.

The first public hearing before the
planning commission is scheduled for
Feb. 8. The commission will make
recommendations to city council,
which will make the ﬁnal decision.

“The thing that disturbs me the
most is that we were encouraged to
buy these houses because they were
uninhabited and we made all these
changes, Streams said, “and now
they’ve changed the rules in mid-
stream.”

King said the changes in the law
do not affect fraternity houses be-
cause they are only allowed in certain
areas anyway. Because of the noise,
King said, fraternity houses cannot be
built in single family districts.

The amendment to an existing
ordinance, drafted in December 1987,
redeﬁned family to include four unre-
lated people who live together.

The number was changed from
two after the city council, responding
to complaints about noncompliance
with the law, compared housing codes
in Lexington with those in other
college communities, King said.

“Anywhere you go these days it
is more typical than not to ﬁnd peo-
ple coming together to find housing
arrangements,” King said.

OPINION

A good rush rule
isn’t too popular

Section V, Part C of the Washington and Lee Panhellenic
Association’s Formal Rush Rules states:

During the designated nights of Rush, no sorority active
or‘ pledge will be allowed to attend any collegiate social
ﬁtnctions, including fraternity parties.

Seems simple enough — or at least it seemed simple
enough to the women of W&L’s three sororities when they
passed it last spring.

But when they heard the rule. again — two days before
Rush week — it did not seem simple anymore. Suddenly,
people didn’t understand, they just couldn’t remember where
that rule came from and were sure they didn’t vote for it.

Lee Chapel turned into an arena where the Panhellenic
Association’s approximately 300 members shouted
objections at the unfortunate delegate assigned to read the
Rush rules. One voice raised above the rest demanded:
“Why can’t we change the rule right now, RIGHT

“NOW?!” Another voice: “Can we go to the Palms?
Fraternity parties? DINNER?” Others wondered if the
people complaining would turn to dust if they did not get
to go out for one week.

Two days later, the Panhellenic Council had to issue the
following “Explanation of Part V, Section C” — the simple
rule — which contained its purpose: '

To avoid social contact which will put an active or a
pledge in a position where she may discuss Rush with
anyone who is not in her sorority, especially the rushees or
other W&L students (i.e. fraternity parties, the Palms or
Spanky’s). It is advised that after the night's rush activities
have terminated, actives and pledges return to where they
live (unless you are studying, obviously), so that neither the
temptation nor the opportunity to discuss Rush with persons
who are not members of your sorority could arise. If you
choose to socialize with members of you own sorority in
your home, it is your responsibility to be certain that this
will not lead to social contact with others outside your
sorority.

This rule does not exclude you from attending all-school
events (i.e. W&L basketball game), but beware of discussing
anything regarding Rush while at these events.

PS. The excuse "I didn’t know” will not work here.

A violation of this rule is considered "a “minor” infraction
by the PHC. As of now, no women were turned in to the
PHC for violating this rule. If they had been, penalties
might have been as severe as deprivation of social
privileges for the whole chapter, not just those involved.

Now think about it. Realistically, the rule applied to just
one night. Wednesday night, all sorority women were
involved in membership selection until the wee hours, and
usually nothing socially pressing is scheduled for Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday or Thursday nights. So that leaves Friday.

It happened that on the Friday night in question several
“big” fraternity events had been scheduled. This is
unfortunate. But when you consider how important Rush is,
and the fact that you should be concentrating on the welfare
of your sorority and the rushees and not on your own social
concerns, is one night so important?

The rule was not made to GET sorority women. It was
made to spare feelings from being hurt by seemingly
harmless remarks made in any social setting during this
sensitive week.

Elected representatives from each sorority drafted the rule,
and each chapter voted on it separately. At the time, it
seemed like the best thing to do for everyone involved. It
still is the best thing. The fact that other circumstances
changed around the rule doesn’t alter its validity.

Just remember, next time you’re asked to vote on
something like this, consider carefully the implications of
your decision. When you raise your hand to vote, be
prepared to stick by your decision.

Classmate recalls Todd SmithE

MY VIEW
By Rick Swagler

EDITOR'S NOTE.‘ Rick Swagler was the editor of
The Ring-turn Phi in 1983 and 1984. This column
ﬁrst appeared in the most recent edition of the
Washington Journalism Review and is reprinted
with permission.

Todd C. Smith started out at The Tampa
Tribune in April 1988 as a reporter on the city
desk. Within a short time he was writing a colunm
on county politics. But what he really wanted was
to be a foreign correspondent. And he was making
progress toward his goal.

Just before joining the Tribune, he had spent
several months freelancing in Honduras and
Nicaragua, which included a 10-week, 200-mile
stint travelling with the contras. Later, the Tribune
sent the 28-year-old reporter, who was ﬂuent in
Spanish, to cover the drug-related violence
wracking Colombia. That resulted in a two—part
series.

But last September, when Smith asked for an
assignment to Peru, a prime coca-growing region,
his editors refused. Smith had wanted to cover the
municipal elections near Lima, generally considered
a referendum on‘ the’ upcoming ‘national elections. ‘_
And he wanted to continue probing drug
trafficking. Instead, the editors said that they might
later send him to cover Peru's presidential election.
His assignment editor, Diane Egner, says there
were also safety concerns.

Undaunted, Smith took two weeks of vacation
and with his own money bought a ticket to Lima.
It was a fatal decision.

In Peru Smith spent two days covering
municipal elections. At some point he contacted
Sally Bowen, a reporter for a local English-
language paper. He stayed one night at the house
in Lima she shares with Sharon Stevenson, a string
for Time and the Miami Herald. Then he set out
for Uchiza, 245 miles northeast of Lima.

The two correspondents had told Smith that
Uchiza, described by many as a lawless cocaine
boom town, could be safely visited by foreign
reporters provided they stayed in groups or with
army soldiers. Smith did neither, reportedly saying
he didn't want to be associated with the anny.

Smith was “very laid back,” Bowen later

recalled. “He was going to do a magazine piece.

No gentlemen
at banquet,
says waiter

On Saturday evening, Jan. 20, I had the rare
opportunity to experience a unique event. It was
the fourth annual Lee-Jackson Banquet, which
honored those heroic men and also celebrated the
concept of the Southern gentleman and the
Confederacy. Members of the Washington and
Lee community were there, as well as honored
guests. I witnessed this event as an objective
observer, working as a waiter. My comments
should not be construed as derogatory to the
group, as I feel compelled to make some random
observations.

I observed people of honor and integrity enter
the room, dressed formally and intent with
purpose. I saw many familiar and different faces,
and I was anxious to see how the evening would
transpire.

An interesting prayer began the evening
asking for strength to help those who do not
understand the group’s purpose to understand it
better. They prayed for those who taint the
southern gentleman ideology with racism,
ignorance, and hypocrisy.

The festivities began with a hearty meal and
considerable drinking. Then there was song. They
sang “Dixie,” “Bonnie Blue Flag," and an
interesting song written by some of the members
of the group called “Lincoln Killed the
Constitution.” Its refrain went like this: “Lincoln
killed the Constitution, Lincoln killed the
Constitution, Lincoln killed the Constitution, and
danced on its remains." It also claimed that
Brennan and Blackrnun killed the Constitution. I
did not agree with those statements.

I heard toasts made to the honorable Gen.

 

Todd Smith

We told him all the precautions he should take.”

Smith ﬂew to Tarapoto, which has the only
airport in the region, on Nov. 15. No one is certain
how he reached ' Uchiza, but he visited the
agricultural co-op there and asked about the United
Nations’ plan to persuade coca growers to switch
to other crops. '

Smith had been expected to fly out of Lima on
the following Sunday evening. When Bowen and
Stevenson did not hear from him, they attempted
to track him by radio. Contacts were made with
the cooperative Smith had visited, but reports were
sketchy. Sound quality from the remote region was
poor, and Bowen noted that the people of Uchiza
are “very wary about what they say” on the air.
When there was still no word from Smith on
Monday, Stevenson called the Tribune.

A body, later identified as Smith’s, was found
the next day near a soccer ﬁeld in Uchiza. Beside
it, a note read: “in this way die American spies
linked to the Pentagon. Death to North American
Imperialism; Long live the Communist Party. Long
live the war of the people.” Smith had been
severely beaten. Autopsy reports later showed that
his neck had been broken by pressure from a rope.

Tribune Executive Editor H. Doyle Harvill went
to Lima to identify the body and bring it back to
Tallahassee.

Precisely what happened to Smith is not known.
He was last seen alive at the Uchiza airstrip on

LETTERS

Robert E. Lee and to the preservation of the
Southern gentleman. There was a toast
concerning “Danm Yankees,” i.e., people who
are from the North. I heard a voice of reason
toast to the Soutlr’s future and ask to put the
past behind themselves (in reference to the song
I quoted). Not many people heard him, since
very few toasted to that.

I saw a few intoxicated people fall and knock
over a table, making quite a mess. Some guests,
who happened to be my peers, decided to show
some aggression towards me and my co-workers.
They demanded service through some insulting
remarks and gestures, and when it was done to
their disapproval, one grabbed a waiter by the
shirt and another gentleman proceeded to tell me
my duties as a waiter. He said that guests could
act how they please, they do not need to say
“please” or “thank you,” and continued to
harass and criticize us. And then came the
apologies. I was offered money by one of my
offenders to make amends for his friends’
actions. I felt degraded by that, so I refused.
Ever since, I have received apologies from
several people, but the evening's events were not
erased from my mind.

As the night commenced people asked me to
try and understand the group’s purpose. You may
be as confused as I was, but I learned their sole
intent is holding this banquet every year. That is
all they do. I appreciate the concept of being a
gentleman, though I am not from the South. I
think being a gentleman constitutes respect for
others, integrity and proper self-conduct. I did
not see those aspects embodied in the group.
That evening I felt embittered and degraded, and
now I find it impossible not to feel that way. I
still do not understand the elusive ideals of the
organization, and I never will if this is how they
are celebrated. Until I understand, I hope the
group does not represent the Southern majority.
Sincerely,

Ryan M. Kull, ’92

Sunday, waiting for a ﬂight to Tarapoto on his '
way back to Lima. Peruvian newspapers and g
officials say he was kidnapped from the airport by
“Shining Path” guerrillas and then turned over to ’
Colombian drug lords as a drug agent for $30,000. ,
An official in the American embassy, while
noting that alliances between the drug traffickers 0
and the group couldn't be ruled out, has urged ,.
caution in evaluating the reports. Various officials ‘
have speculated that the note found with Smith was I
faked by drug cartel members to point the furger ‘
back to the Shining Path, which is widely known

to extort money from coca growers. to

According to unconﬁrmed news accounts, the
guerrillas “sold" Smith to a Medellin cartel
member known as “The Rabid One.” La
Republica, a Lima newspaper, said that Srnith’s
credentials, tape recorder, notes and camera had
been confiscated and that he was “brutally
interrogated. ’ '

The Inter—American Press Association has noted
that “a press card can be a death warrant in those
areas of Latin America where drug traffickers and
guerrillas have formed an alliance.”

According to the Miami Herald, Smith may .

have been mistaken for a DEA agent because U.S.
narcotics officials in the area have posed as

reporters in the past -— a speculation rejected by -

U.S. embassy officials. But the Lirna-based
newsletter Per Report said in January 1989 that a
DEA agent “occasionally traveled in the area
posing as a reporter.”

According to the Herald, sources close to the
army discount the link beaten the guerrillas and
drug leaders and say Smith was killed by the
guerrillas. “A major hurdle in determining the
accuracy of the reports is an ongoing power
struggle between Peru’s army and police forces,"
the Herald said. “Skeptics suspect the interior
minister, who is in charge of the police, may have
fabricated the drug traffickers’ reward story to
embarrass the army. Pem’s army is accused by
some of being too tolerant of the country’s
estimated 100,000 coca growers."

More than 400 friends and colleagues attended
Todd Smith’s funeral in Tallahassee on November
25. Governor Bob Martinez of Florida was among
them. One speaker, family friend Ruel W. Tyson,
Jr., a journalism instructor at the University of
North Carolina, said: “He went for the story; it
was part of his calling. The truth was in Peru, and
Todd went there.”

Support the
Annual Fund

As the Young Alumni Vice Chairman of the
Washington and Lee Annual Fund, I am
responsible for encouraging greater participation
in the Annual Fund among young alumni.

For those who are not familiar with the
Annual Fund, it is the primary means of
soliciting alumni contributions to the university.
Unlike contributions to the university's
endowment, contributions to the Annual Fund go
directly to the university's operating budget.
Proceeds from the Annual Fund are used to buy
library books, pay faculty salaries, and otherwise
ﬁnance the same costs covered by tuition. In
fact, a strong Armual Fund is what allows W&L
to maintain tuition at a relatively low level,
especially in comparison to other selective
schools cross the country.

Although W&L alumni take great pride in the
university, W&L continually ranks well below
most schools with which we compete in terms of
the percentage of alunmi contributions to the
Annual Fund. Because this lack of participation
is particularly acute among young alumni, we are
making a special effort to encourage alumni who
have graduated since 1981 to contribute to the
Alumni Fund.

Part of this effort will be to emphasize to
current W&L students the importance of the
Annual Fund, beginning with the class of 1990,
who will soon be the youngest of the university's
alumni. In the next several weeks, members of
the class will be contacted by a classmate about
participating in the Annual Fund. I hope that
students, when contacted about the Annual Fund,
will make a pledge and participate fully in the
success of the university.

The Peace Dividend:

Finding it in military restructuring

MY VIEW

By Damon Fensterman

Last week I discussed the budgetary implica-
tions of the so-called “Peace Dividend.” But the
monetary question does not tell the full story.
Equally important is what will actually happen to
our national defense once a substantial position in
Europe is no longer necessary.

One great worry is whether or not it is really
safe to remove our troops from Europe. Once we
leave, our troops will be an ocean away, while the
Soviets will only be a border (or a few borders)
away. Certainly this concern is a legitimate one.
The Soviets have not renounced their military, nor
have they lost their resolve to use it. Moreover,
their goal is still global Marxism. They might yet
use their military to achieve that goal.

However, the warming in U.S.-Soviet relations
seems real enough. Out of economic necessity, the
Soviet Union must reduce its military spending. It
seems likely that the level of cuts they will have
to make to regain stability will seriously reduce
their ability to invade Europe successfully. It would
be entirely appropriate and sound both militarily
and economically to adjust our defensive position
accordingly.

So although we can anticipate a reduction in
tensions and in arms levels, we must act with
caution. So far the Soviets have only offered to

* cut poorly-trained units with outdated equipment. It

is doubtful that such units would have much
importance in an invasion anyway. But once the
real cuts do come, we might finally be able to
“bring the boys home” from Europe.

The question then becomes, how will we make
the cuts in our own military? Given the Penta-
gon’s past performance, perhaps this latter concern
is of greater significance than how many dollars or
how many men are cut.

We have seen through the latter half of the
1980s how budget cutting has adversely affected
the military. However, the problem is not in much
money is spent; rather, the problem lies in how the
cuts are made. Specifically, when Congress reduces
the Pentagon’s budget, politicians and military
figures alike tend to keep their pet programs.
Everyone has their favorite weapon or research
program. Thus, money for new weapons systems is

When Congress reduces the
Pentagon’s budget, poli-
ticians tend to keep their

search program.

locked in years in advance. The only budget left to
cut is operations, with disastrous results. While
money is spent to develop new weapons, there is
no money for spare parts and repair of existing
weapons. Moreover, men cannot be adequately
trained either for the existing weapons or the new
ones. We thus end up with the best equipped men
in the world — men equipped with weapons that
don't work or ones they don't know how to use.

Now that cuts are coming from a change in
policy rather than a change in the budget, a new
but similar danger looms on the horizon. As our
defense force grows smaller, it is important to
realize that we can’t just cut it back proportionally.
Instead, the entire military (especially the Army)
must be restructured.

Our armed forces, in conjunction with their
NATO counterparts, are designed to perform a
specific task in a certain way. Our troops in
Europe have two purposes. First, they are designed
to deter Soviet adventurism by their mere presence.
Second, in the event of an invasion, they are to
hold on against overwhelming numbers long
enough for reinforcements to arrive, mostly by sea.
To accomplish these tasks, we must maintain a
sizeable force overseas (we have about 250,0()()
troops in Europe). As such, our European defense
force is designed around bigness and locality.

If we remove those troops, the equation changes
dramatically. First, we must change our basic
stance from one of locality to one of mobility.
Currently, only the Rapid Deployment Force is
designed for that kind of mobility. And RDF is
only a few specialized units who in training exer-
cises have not deployed quite as rapidly as ex-
pected. Consequently, our first commitment to
restructuring must be in the area of mobility. We
must have a signiﬁcant number of units that can
be deployed anywhere in the world (but especially
in Europe) at very short notice. To accomplish this

task we must not only train our men differently,
but we must also spend more money on airborne
transport. We need to buy planes like the C-7 in
significant quantities — planes that can carry almost
as many men as the giant C-5’s, but that can land
at hundreds of airstrips all over Europe as opposed
to only a handful of bases with extended runways.
Without these measures, our forces will not even
be a threat to the Soviets, especially if there is a
resurgence of militarism.

Secondly, when we cut back the size of our
armed forces, we must restructure them from top
to bottom. Our military is designed to be a certain
size, which is more or less static. When signifi-
cant force reductions are made, one isn't simply
scaling down the military. That is, a troop cutback
doesn't leave the Armed Forces just smaller. It
leaves them understqﬂed. The solution is not
necessarily to avoid cuts. Rather, the solution is to
restructure the armed forces so they are designed
to be smaller.

Such a restructuring will involve not only the
command structure but will also reach all the way
down to the squad level. Squads, which are groups
of usually 12 men, are the basic building blocks of
the Army. How a squad is equipped and trained
has a great deal to do with how the platoon, the
company, and the whole army fight. In a large
army, squads (except for mechanized infantry)
aren't as well equipped. Size is the main weapon.
In a smaller army, squads must be heavily armed
because there is probably only one line of defense
and no reinforcements.

Thus, we must restructure our Army squads to
more closely resemble the heavily armed and well-
trained Marine squads, where four men might share .
two belt-fed machine guns and a grenade launcher,
in addition to their personal weapons. The purpose
of such a restructuring would not be to make our
smaller Army just as strong as it was before the
cuts. And the idea is not to spend more money on
fewer men. Rather, these changes must be made
just to have a viable defense force. It will be
heavily armed, but it will be nowhere near as
strong as the one we have now.

More money must be spent in some areas, but
dramatic cuts will be made in others. In the end,
even with all the changes, the much-touted peace
dividend can become a reality. And if we restruc-
ture our military properly, we might actually have
a little peace to go along with the money we save.

Should the EC govern the law school?

MY VIEW
By Mitch Neurockl

The Honor System, as it has been pointed
out, exists to protect the university communi-
ty from those individuals who demonstrate
that they cannot be trusted by the rest of us.
Additionally, it serves as a guideline for
conduct, seeking to channel comportment to
match that which was desired by General
Robert E. Lee. How do we decide whether
the ‘conduct of an accused is sufficiently bad
to warrant so severe a penalty as expulsion?

In deciding whether the Honor System at
Washington and Lee is being fairly adminis-
tered, we should take into account the char-
acter of the judging body and actively ques-
tion not its integrity, but its competence to
judge the guilt or innocence of the accused.

It is my position that the Executive Com-
mittee is unqualified to act on honor matters
concerning law students. What follows is both
an attempt to explain why the EC lacks the
ability to adjudicate law school honor matters
and a proposal to resolve the problem.

Events may certainly be viewed a number
of different ways; during the course of an
honor hearing, the advocates for the accused
are likely to try to depict the events that took
place as being of an acceptable character. The

‘prime goal of the defense is to avoid the

portrayal of the accused’s conduct in such a
light as to be less than that standard which
is accepted in the community as a whole.

The problem that arises, then, is what to
do once the testimony has been presented.
The EC retires for deliberations — to decide
what? It is here that the EC members realize
they must not only judge what actually took
place, but also what is the proper conduct for
the accused, given the situation.

In the case of an undergraduate accused,
the process of deciding guilt or innocence is
not overly problematic. The EC uses an
objective standard; its members inject them-
selves into the place of the accused. They
attempt to determine what would have been
the proper course of action, if the accused
has acted improperly. If two-thirds of the EC
decides beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused has intentionally violated the trust of
the university community and can find no
sufficiently excusing circumstances, then they
are entitled to find the accused guilty.

But what happens in the case of a law
student? It is tough enough just to place
yourself in a situation or an environment
where you have never been. It is even tough-
er to place yourself in a new environment
and attempt to judge, out of context, the
acceptability of the conduct of someone who
is already accustomed to that setting.

Without meaning to sound pompous, I
contend that the undergraduate members of
the EC have a fatal inability to understand
the workings of the law school community,
and are in no position to judge the guilt or
innocence of any of its members.

Granted, the three law student members of
the EC can shed some light on the state of

cide an honor matters

affairs on this side of campus. They are,
however, only three votes of 13. It may be
possible to sway the opinions of the under-
graduate members of the committee with ﬁrst-
hand expertise, but this is not the function of
a hearing body. Each member should be
individually capable of judging independently
whether the conduct of the accused was
reasonable under the circumstances. Relying
on the knowledge of three law students as
“experts” is unacceptable when the career of
another student is at stake.

Furthermore, the presence of only three
law students on the EC raises the possibility,
however remote, of a law student being found
guilty even if all three law school representa-
tives dissent.

I see no reason why the law school
should surrender the right to adjudicate honor
matters arising within its own scope of activi-
ties. We are permitting undergraduates to
assert controlling jurisdiction in determining
the guilt or innocence of persons they have
never met, and to pass judgement in matters
about which they know little or nothing. In

short, we have defaulted on our own commit-
ment to justice by blindly submitting to the
authority of strangers. p . _ J

The entire notion of justice in the Honor
System is based upon the fact that it is
student-run, with no faculty interference. I
agree wholeheartedly with this concept. At the
same time, I also believe that for justice to
be done, the accused must be afforded judg-
ment by his peers. Undergraduates are not
members of the law school community; they
are not our peers. Law students may justifi-
ably resent being judged by outsiders, and
especially by outsiders who are only 18 years
old. By the same token, undergraduate and
law school communities are part of one big
“family" at the university. In many respects,
this is true: we share many social functions,
dining facilities, and budgetary problems. One
would not find it difficult to agree on the
acceptability of having a unitary body to
decide on a course of action regarding these
common issues.

It does not follow, however, that the
responsibility and authority to pass judgment
on honor matters should rest with a body
made up of a cross-section of the university
as a whole. For justice to be done, students
accused of honor violations ‘should receive the
benefit of judgement by their peers. It is
time, in my view, to detach the law school
from undergraduate jurisdiction in honor mat-
ters, and vice versa.

I propose an honor council be formed
within the law school, with exclusive authori-
ty to decide on honor matters taking place

within the law school. A seven-member panel,
made up of two elected representatives from
each class, plus one member elected at large,
would be responsible for investigating possi-
ble honor offenses and conducting hearings if,
from the evidence found, it appears likely that
an honor offense has been committed.

The creation of such a body will eliminate
the problems in perspective which plague the
current EC in honor matters involving law
students. It will also relieve the investigation
process of wasted time spent determining
normal courses of conduct in the law school.
The undergraduates would also be freed of
the unfair burden of being judged by students
from outside their community.

I do not mean to suggest that the EC be

OPINION ‘

The Ftlng-tum Phl, January 25, 1990

Alumnis

objects

to ‘sex’ review

MY VIEW
By Jamie Berger

Mr. Peppers’ article in last
week’s Phi regarding sex, lies, and
videotape was a fascinating expo-
sition on his own naivete, but not
much as a movie review. Perhaps
Mr. Peppers’ sagacious Journalism
101 professor failed to mention
that a reviewer should have some
comprehension of his topic before
writing an article.

The review cited many prob-
lenis with the movie. Here is a list
of the most noteworthy:

12 The ﬁlm’s “shocking” title
is a potential trafﬁc hazard, and
will cause the grandmothers of
Lexington to blush.

2. The theater failed to hand
out Cliff Notes on the movie. (I
have enclosed a Cliff Notes ver-
sion in this colurrin for Mr. Pep-
pers’ sake).

3. The movie’s “bizarre sexual
perversity" reminded him of other
movies he didn’t understand, like
Blue Velvet.

4. The acting is sometimes
subtle, requiring the viewer to
actually listen to the dialogue.

5. The characters discuss and
engage in sex. Sometimes (Egadl)
without a partner(see #3 above).

6. The ﬁlm’s technical limita-
tions may easily distract those who
are already not paying attention to
the dialogue(see #4 above).

The main target of Mr. Pep-
pers’ scorn is the Graham Dalton
character, played by James Spader.
The reviewer is dismayed by the
character's insistence on living a
“one key” existence, free of al-
most all the responsibilities that
the keys represent,

Although extreme, I know of
few people who have not been
tempted by the one key life; the
Amish obviously agree since they
have opted for a no-key existence
and seem quite happy about it.
Why has this character abandoned
his old life for this one-key ver-
sion? What made the Spader char-
acter develop diametrically opposed
to his old, college friend, (the
philandering lawyer played by
Peter Gallagher)? These are the
questions director/writer Steven
Soderbergh is asking the audience
to consider. Meanwhile, Phi re-
viewer Peppers doesn’t even recog-
nize there were any questions.
Thus, I suppose, his need for Cliff
Notes.

Mr. Peppers claims to enjoy
the line about lawyers being the
lowest form of life. Here the re-
viewer not only misquotes the line
but misses the central theme of the

movie in the process. Graham
states that lawyers are the second
lowest form of life, liars being the
very lowest. Although this impor-
tant comment was lost on Mr.
Peppers, it came through loud and
clear to the John Mulraney char-
acter, who in a brief ﬁt of self-
awareness calls himself the “ﬁrst
and second" lowest form of life.

Strip away the “sex” and
“videotape" and one comes to the
crux of the matter, which are the
lies. Graham completely rejects
lies, (at least outwardly), while
John wraps himself in them. Pres-
ented with an alternative, the fe-
male characters gravitate towards
Graham and away from John.

More amusing was Mr. Pep-
pers’ high dudgeon over the sexual
content of the ﬁlm. If references to
masturbation and videotapes of
women talking about sex are “bi-
zarre sexual perversions” that
caused Mr. Peppers to be “utterly
bafﬂed,” then I would suggest that
one hour of “Geraldo” would
send him into a near catatonic
state. Once again, Mr. Peppers is
so busy being bafﬂed and per-
plexed he doesn’t consider any
substantive questions about the
movie. Could it be that the review
was actually written by Tipper
Gore under a nom de plume?

Finally, when the reviewer at-
tempts to actually read something
into the movie he completely
misses the mark. The review cites
the ﬁlm’s poor technical quality.
Mr. Peppers ﬁnds this ruse dis-
ingenious on Mr. Soderberghs part,
but don’t worry because he
“doesn’t take long to ﬁgure out
the symbolism of the director's
style.” If you believe that, I have
great foot bridge in Lexington I’d
like to sell you. The audio is poor,
and the ﬁlm grainy for a simple
reason — money. Really a lack
thereof since the movie was shot
on a shoestring budget. Did the
Phi pan She's Gotta Have It be-
cause Spike Lee couldn't afford
color ﬁlm?

Yes Mr. Peppers, ranking sex,
lies, and videotape with Uncle
Buck does indeed conﬁrm your
level of sophistication —- or should
I say sophistry. ‘

Now, for the sake of clariﬁca-
tion, I provide the aforementioned
Cliff Notes.

Paragraph 1: Jamie suggests
that the Phi reviewer doesn’t know
what he is talking about. Brings up
the now famous Mr. Gaherty.

Paragraph 2: A synopsis is pro-
vided of Mr. Peppers’ rriisgivings
about the ﬁlm. The author seems
to imply that the reviewer’s com-
plaints are laughable.

Solving ‘perplexing mysteries’

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

In an effort to satisfy my female
editor’s ardent desire for a fulﬁlling
journalistic encounter, I will endeavor
to penetrate the virginal landscape of
current affairs by thrusting my virile
writing utensil into yet another topical
story.

In this article I have decided to
address those perplexing mysteries of
human existence that have frustrated
philosophers since the old days when
mankind was still ﬂoating around in
that'post—big bang, evolutionary bowl
of clam chowder, and journalists were
allowed to tell careless readers to go
back and slowly re-read the ﬁrst
sentence of their articles.

The ﬁrst perplexing mystery in-
volves movie theaters, where people
have historically gone to avoid talk-

ing to first dates or family members.
For some strange reason, a subversive
and highly annoying group of people
persist in clapping at the end of
emotional movies such as E.T., in
which an ugly, extra-terrestrial crea-
ture is integrated into American soci-
ety after proving he can use a tele-
phone and ride a ﬂying bicycle. Do
these movie clappers believe that the
cast and producers of E.T. are sitting
near them in the theater and deserve
to be rewarded? Perhaps the clappers
are all addicted to -an expensive psy-
chedelic drug that is dispensed freely
to anyone with the nerve to clap at
the end of a movie. Maybe the clap-
pers have been told by Ann Landers
or Oprah Winfrey that daily clapping
will bring them wealth, love and a
new wardrobe. Maybe the movie
clappers also clap when they hear a
good song on the radio. Maybe we
should move on to another perplexing
mystery. (Readers who think this is a

good idea should now applaud).

Perplexlng mystery #2: Why is
every motel room in the solar system,
even those that have vibrating beds,
furnished with at least one Bible?

Answer: Back before they in-
vented churches, pious families woke
up early Sunday, put on their best
clothes, checked into a motel room
and without hesitation, turned on the
vibrating beds. Of course, I’m only
joking. Motels provide Bibles so
patrons have drug-free alternatives to
staying up late and watching porn
ﬂicks.

Perplexlng mystery #3: How
come the corporate world has been
allowed to take over college football
to such an extent that the Orange
Bowl is now referred to as the
“Beatrice-Mutual of Omaha-Toyota-
Drink Florida Orange (Juice) Bowl?”

Answer: I have no idea but let's
just thank God that journalism is free
from any type of corporate inﬂuence

(eat Cap'n Crunch Cereal and ﬂy
Delta Airlines).

Perplexlng mystery #4: What
happens to all the gum that people
constantly spit out onto the ground?

Perplexlng mystery #5: What
inﬂuenced me to write an article that
proves beyond a shadow of a doubt
that I deserve to be locked up in a
building with people who express
themselves by drooling?

Answer: Actually, I had planned
to write an award—winning editorial
on developments in Eastern Europe
when it occurred to me that I keep

ing about the subject.

Revamping the Episcopal Church

MY VIEW

By George Nomikos and
J. Cameron Humphries

And there is no health in us.
— General Confession, 1928 Book of
Common Prayer

I was recently telling a friend that
the presiding bishop of the Episcopal
Church was to visit Lexington. He
asked what the presiding bishop was,
and when I replied that he was the
spiritual leader of our church, he
stated that he did not realize our
church had a spiritual leader —— nei-
ther do most Episcopalians, nor
should they.

In the past 20 years, membership
within the Church has declined by 28
percent, more than any other main-
stream denomination. It is odd as the
Church enters its decade of Evan-
gelism, with the goal of spreading the
Gospel to every non-Christian, the
Church cannot deﬁne its own doc-
trine, much less maintain its mem-
bership. Perhaps the greatest chal-
lenge of the decade will not be ex-
panding church communicants, but
re-establishing ﬁrm ecclesiastical
leadership, grounded in 2,000 years
of dogma and biblical text.

Historically, Anglicans have ac-
cepted a wide variety of religious
doctrines and ceremonial traditions.
This latitude, however, has been
based on tradition and the unquestion-
able validity of the Holy Scripture.
This freedom has precluded beliefs
that are blatantly contrary to the
foundations of Christian faith. Recent-
ly because of incompetent (and ques-
tionably Christian) leadership in the
church, faithfulness to Christ’s word

has been supplanted by society's
whims and mandates.

In the past few years, church
leaders have been allowed to take
positions that are ﬂagrantly contrary
to Episcopal cannon, as well as the
entire Holy Catholic and Apostolic
Church. For example: the ordination
of women to the episcopate, the
questioning of the Gospel as the
Word and Passion of Our Savior
Jesus Christ, and the recent admission
of professed and practicing homosex-
uals as fully legitimate members of

the Body of Christ, are not only-

blasphemous, but heretical.

Why do people turn to organized
religion? Primarily for one reason,
answers. Yet recently the Church has
provided few answers, nor have they
even attempted to. Instead, under a
guise of maintaining an “open door,"
it has driven out orthodox and life-
long Episcopalians, in exchange for
new membership, which has been at
best shallow, at worst, undevout and
unorthodox.

Recently, headlines have delighted
in reporting the moves “toward hon-
esty and integrity” within our
Church The Right Reverend Bishop
Spong, Bishop of Newark, has been
the center of continual controversy. A
few years ago, he traveled to the Far
East where he not only participated in
Buddhist religious services, but de-
scribed them as valid religions that
should be recognized by the Christian
church as such. This is in contradic-
tion to Holy Scripture in which
Christ states “no one comes to the
Father, but through Me.” Yet Bishop
Spong is not alone. Only a few miles
south of his diocese, the Diocesan
Council in Pennsylvania could not
agree upon whether or not Christ was

tion as He Himself claimed to be.
Across the nation, “Episcopalians”
are calling for the Church to ordain
and bless extra—marital relationships,
homosexual liaisons, and other im-
moral lifestyles. Instead of receiving
the condemnation of the Church
hierarchy, they are received under the
new policy of acceptance. Under such
a policy, there are few who could not
maintain their current lifestyles and
remain Episcopalians. The distinction
of being an Episcopalian simply no
longer exists.

It has been the distinction that
supposedly marks Christians, and
Episcopalians, as God’s own which
separates us from society. There is
an old campﬁre song in which the
refrain states, “They will know we
are Christians by our love.” While
this is a noble ideal, there is more to
spirituality than love. A church must
preach more than “love thy neigh-
bor," if it is to provide spiritual sus-
tenance to its ﬂock. M Episcopa-
lian sheep have left for‘ eener pas-
tures. What, then, has this new breed
of sheep been feeding upon?

First, as so eloquently stated by
one Episcopal minister, they seek
blessing of their current lifestyle. This
very statement is an acknowledgement
of man’s need for justification,‘ how-
ever, historically it has been the
church’s role to lead man away from

Rt. 5, Box 379
Lexington, VA 24450

his own wickedness, not to sanctify
his sinfulness.

At no point in the history of the
Anglican Communion has this disre-
gard for the Church’s position been

so blasphemed as in the example of

Bishop Spong and his illegal ordina-
tion of a practicing homosexual last
month. His actions were in direct

contradiction of the General Conven-

tion of 1979, and Bishop Spong’s
ordination vow to “solemnly engage
to conform to the doctrine, discipline,
and worship of the [Protestant] Epis-
copal Church.” While this was not
the first embarrassing and heretical
action the Bishop has taken, it is
certainly the most heinous. It is quite
obvious to the rest of the catholic
community (of which the Episcopal
Church still claims to be a part) that
this Bishop is a heretic, and should
be defrocked and excommunicated. If
our church leadership has reached the
point where it does not see this, then
our church is in far graver danger
than we realize.

If Presiding Bishop will not assert
his leadership and discipline now,
then when? Shall Episcopalians not
only ‘be expected to endure, but ac-
cept such heresies under the blanket
of brotherly love? Shall those Episco-
palians who verbally oppose the
current trends within the Church to
“catch up” with the current trends
within society be made to feel as
second rate communicants, if not
outcast entirely? Shall we continue to
spiral down the present paths of
secularism and modernism away from
the Word of Christ? Or shall the
head of the Episcopal Church ﬁnally
stand up and ﬁrmly denounce these
transgressions so that as a Church we
may “with hearty repentance and true
faith tum unto Him?”

AIDS expert blames ads

By Alison McGloln
Staff Reporter

Alcohol and lack of self-esteem ,

are the two biggest factors m the
spread of AIDS, according to the
director of the University of Vir-
ginia’s department of student health.

An expert on AIDS, Dr. Richard
P. Keeling spoke in Lee Chapel Jan.
18 on the college student’s risk of
contracting the fatal disease.

He told the students that the aver-
age age of someone who has been
diagnosed with AIDS is 32. Because
there is a latency phase of nine years,
Keeling said, young people between
the ages of 16 and 28 are at the
greatest risk of contracting the dis-
ease.

Keeling noted that 84 percent of
American college and university
students are in this high-risk age
group.

He presented a number of statis-
tics showing the level of sexual activ-
ity among students and the number
who fail to use preventive methods.

One poll, he said, showed that 87
percent of male college students and
78 percent of female college students
were sexually active. The poll indi-
cated only 58 percent of sexually
active students had used a condom
the last time they had sex.

Young people receive conﬂicting
messages from advertisements and

AIDS prevention groups.

“Campus culture,” or students’
perceptions of acceptable and admira-
ble behavior, draw more from adver-
tisements than from the voices of
reason, Keeling said.

While AIDS preventionists say,
“Just Say No" and “Don’t mix
alcohol and sex," Keeling said, the
campus culture permits “SUI __ sex
under the inﬂuence. In other words,
sleeping with someone you probably
wouldn’t even go to lunch with under
normal circumstances.”

Keeling showed a number of ads
to support his message. Most of the
companies selling alcohol were also
selling sex, he said.

One whiskey advertisement
showed a scantily dressed man and
woman with the message, “Be a Part
of It.”

“We all know what IT is,” Keel-
ing said.

While AIDS preventionists tell
males not to “lose control,” Keeling
said, the ads tell them to “take con-
trol.”

While AIDS preventionists tell
females to “stay in control,” Keeling
said, advertisements tell women to
“ignore your better judgement.”

Keeling emphasized the conse-
quences of unprotected intercourse.
People never suffer from sexually
transmitted diseases, psychological
problems, problems with drugs or
alcohol, or pregnancy in the adver-

tisements, he said.

Keeling said the problem of self-
esteem enters the picture because the
ads lack intimacy and diversity. Ev-
eryone in the ads is white, heterosex-
ual and gorgeous, he said. Thus, he
continued, if you are not like the
person in the ad, you think you
should change something ~ so you
buy the product.

According to Keeling, the entire
premise on which the ads are based
is the undermining of one’s
self-esteem.

Fear, denial, prejudice, discrimina-
tion and controversy are words often
associated with AIDS, Keeling said.

“There is also a new word associ-
ated with AIDS,” Keeling said,
“hope.”

Better strategies and better drugs
are prolonging lives, he said.

Although an AIDS vaccine is not
foreseeable in this decade, he said,
drugs such as DDI and AZT are
giving more people hope for a longer
life.

Keeling, an associate professor of
internal medicine at UVa’s school of
medicine, graduated from UVa. He
received his M.D. from Tufts Univer-
sity School of Medicine. He is presi-
dent of the American College Health
Association and a member of the ad
hoc advisory committee on AIDS for
the Public Health Service and the
executive board of the National AIDS
Network.

from page 4

Paragraph 3: Author suggests
that Mr. Peppers should loosen up.
Questions are provided that a
thoughtful viewer may ask him/her
self during movie. Author suggests
solution to reviewers previously
mentioned need for Cliff’s Notes.

Paragraph 4: The author points
out Mr. Peppers’ selective memory
and.--its detrimental effect on the
review. It is postulated that the cen-
tral word of the title could be the
central theme of the movie.

Paragraph 5: The author seems to
be “utterly bafﬂed” by the review-
er’s inability to comprehend film. A
semi-serious suggestion i's made that

the reviewer is actually a prominent
Senator’s wife.

Paragraph 6: Column points out
that reviewer did not do homework
on movie. Seems to imply that re-
viewer need merely have called Mr.
Soderbergh since the latter is a Vir-
ginia resident.

Conclusion: Jamie suggests that
the Phi reviewer doesn't really know
what he is talking about.

Questions for review:

1. Most credible movie reviewers
watch a movie more than once.
Would this have helped Mr. Peppers’
review?

2. Who is Mr. Gaherty? Why is

he even mentioned?

3. Why does Mr. Peppers con-
tinually proclaim his puzzlement over
the movie and its overwhelmingly
positive reviews by people who know
what they are talking about (i.e.
Siskel and Ebert, Vincent Canby,
etc...)?

4. Consider the following quote:
“I just don’t find people masturbating
very artistic at all.” Does this reflect
the thinking of a student of a fine
liberal-arts institution? List 10 fa-
mous artists (any area) who would be

affected by this quote. Note: thej
author suggests starting the list with —

Philip Roth, or Gunter Grass.

Fancy Dress Chairman Alexander
Hitz drew the most attention at Mon-
day night’s Executive Committee
meeting with his report on the prog-
ress of Fancy Dress spending.

Hitz told the EC that Peter Duch-
iri’s swing orchestra has contracted to
play at the FD Ball on Friday, March
9. According to Hitz, Dtichiri himself
is not scheduled to perform, but if he
does not have another engagement, he
may show up at no extra charge. The
FD Committee has paid $4,000 of the
$8,000 cost for Duchin’s band.

A rock band for the same night
has not yet signed, said Hitz.

Student Activities Board Treasur-
er Kathleen Duwel did not attend the
meeting, but later reenforced her
September hope that FD will pay for
itself this year, generating about
$50,()00 in ticket revenue and
$12,000 in memorabilia. revenue.

Though over $100,000 has been
spent on past Fl)s, Duwel believes
that careful budgeting can produce a
successful event without such high
costs.

“It looks like everything is
going along smoothly,” said Sopho-
more EC Rep. Clayton Kennington.

Third-year law Rep. David An-
thony added, “'I‘hey’ve done a good
job of juggling the money so they
can...provide. an equivalent F1) for
less....”

Duwel added that Cliarlie Dairi-
els may perform the SAB-sponsored
concert on the 'l'IiIIrsd>ty prior to FD,
but that contract has not yet arrived.

A fall--term surplus on SAB

NEWS  

books is causing an unexpected but
welcome challenge to the EC.

According to Duwel, roughly
$10,000 remains in the bank from
the SAB’s $15,000 fall—terrn enter-
tainment budget. The SAB is now
working with its winter-term enter-
tainment budget of $10,000. Last
term’s surplus is in the hands of the
EC which must decide the money’s
fate.

“We don’t want to end the year
with this money in reserve,” said
Duwel. “We want to entertain peo-
ple."

EC Vice President
Sheinberg lauded the SAB,
crediting their successful Fall Term to
careful bookkeeping and teamwork by
Duwel and SAB Chaimian Charles
Conklin.

Sheinberg indicated that the EC
would be receptive to a
recotnrriendatioii from the SAB as to
how to handle the bulk of
the surplus.

Duwel added that she would like
to see some of the surplus saved and
some spent. The spending could go
toward the SAB-sponsored bands for

the Wednesday and Thursday prior to
FD.

In response to budget allocation
requests of $l,32() from the Political
Review and $950 from the Journal of
Science, the EC voted in favor of
lowering the Publications Board mini-
mum reserve to the student body
constitutional minimum of $2,500.
According to Sheinberg, this action
will override the Publications Board
constitutional $4,000 minimum and
free an additional $1,500 for these
publications.

Next year’s head RA,
dorm counselor picked

By Tracy TIl()I‘IlI..\I:l(I€
Staff Reporter

The head dorm coiirisclor and
head resident assistant for 1990-91
were chosen last week andwill help
fill twenty-nine‘ d<')ri'ii-"'co'uriIs"elor'and
nine resident assistant’ positions for
next year.

Approximately 90 students have
submitted applications for the 38
positions available, said Dean of Res-
idence Life Kenneth Ruscio.

Mary I-larnpson was named head
domi counselor. James Rambeau will
be the school’s hr.-arl resideitt assis-
tant.

According to Ruseio, the qualifi-
cations for the two head positions
include several cliaractcristics.

First, he said, both students must
be able to approach the position in a
creative way and set goals. and objec-
tives that will hcneiit the entire sys--
tcm.

Second, one must be a motivator
and rriust be able to "work with staff
members who may be having a dif-

ficult time dealing with :1 particular,

situation.

Finally, one must display very
strong leadership skills. All these.
qualities, in addition to those required
for any staff tnernher, such as show-
ing a compassion for residents and
exhibiting a willingness to speak
candidly with the administration
about problems, are essential to the
job.

Ruscio called Iriatnpson and Rain-
beau “two very exceptional people
who were chosen from a group of
very exceptional applicants.” ,

working with them next year, ” he
said.

Hanipson said the head dorm
counselor plays a supportive role to
other dorm counselors. She said she
thinks the head D.C. has the oppor-
tunity to make positive changes on
camp'us. ' For exarriplc, she will be
the “mouthpiece of the freshmen”
on the Student Affairs Committee
next year. She will also play an
interpretive role among the freshmen,
the dorm counselors, and the deans.

Rambeau said he applied for the
position of head resident assistant
because he was interested in playing
a rriore influential role in developing
residential policy and activities for
residents.

His experience as a peer coun-
selor, as well as the support of this
year’s head R.A., Catherine Baillio,
influenced his decision to apply.

Next year Rambeau would like to
see greater residence participation in
the planning of social events as well
as a greater utilization of the Gaines
Gatehouse facility.

In addition he would like to
come up with a new strategy to at-
tract more students to Gaines, such
as encouraging sorority halls and pro-
moting existing .-3"’.-[Ii;lll facilivit-;; iii
the dorm. Althougii excited for next
year, Rambeau says he plans “to
continue to help make this year's
program a success.”

Preliminary interviews for the 38
dorm counselor and resident assistant
positions will be held next week,
with additional ititcrviews the fol-
lowing week.

the selections has been set for made

EC hears plans for FD

more funding than the Publications
Board can provide, Sheinberg said
they may solicit the difference from
the EC.

“People will get their money,”
said Sheinberg, “it's just a matter of
from where.”

Director of University Food
Service Gerald Darrell addressed the
EC, appealing last week’s execu-
tive-session decision to not grant the
$250 requested for this week’s Lip
Synch, of which Darrell is in charge.

The EC denied that request last
week largely on the grounds that the
money was going to a charity. Lip
Synch is a benefit for Students Aga-
inst Multiple Sclerosis and the Na-
tional Multiple Sclerosis Society.

Darrell argued that Lip Synch is
an entertainment activity for students,
and the money would fund prizes on-
ly, not be a donation.

The EC overturned its denial
and granted the money with a 7-6
decision. Secretary Christopher Gib-
lin, first-year law Rep. Julie Alagna,
third-year law Rep. David Anthony,
second—year law Rep. Mark Cobb,
junior Rep. Thompson Hatcher and
sophomore Rep. Clayton Kenriington
voted against the allocation.

Sheinberg said the $250 would
most likely be drawn from the SAB

-surplus.

Voting Regulations Board Chair-
man Wesley Goings presented some
textual changes to the “Official VRB
Poster Rules” to the EC for advice
and approval.

Posters endorsing candidates
running in any VRB election are now
limited to 8.5 by 11 inches in size,
banning barmers and sheets. Ballot
boxes for all elections will be open

  

John “Jack” Pringle

...new senior rep
from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., rather than the
occasional 6 p.m. closing time recent-
ly exercised by the EC.

“We wanted to increase [voter]
turnout by making [the voting hours]
eight to six," explained Sheinberg,
but the difference was not significant.

EC members expressed concern
that a constituency, not having read
the official rules, could post an illegal
promotion for their candidate, thus
disqualifying him or her from the
election inadvertently. Goings replied
that candidates would have to be told
that they are responsible for any
promotion in their name.

EC President Willard Dumas and
Sheinberg welcomed John “Jack”
Pringle to his new post as senior
representative.

Pringle won last week's run-off
election with 101 votes to Stephen
George’s 94. The VRB also recorded
three “no votes."

Petitions of at least 150 signa-
tures for “The Big Three” -- EC
president, vice president and secretary
-- are due Feb. 5. That election will
take place on Feb. 12 with a run-off
on Feb. 15.

WHO’S ON THE HILL

Rita Dove, winner of the 1987 Pulitzer
Prize In poetry, will give a reading at W&L
Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. in Northen Auditorium.

The reading is sponsored by the Glasgow
Endowment Program at W&L. A reception will
follow.

Dove was born in Akron, Ohio in 1952. In
1970 she was invited to the White House as a
1970 Presidential Scholar, one of the hundred or
so best high school graduates across the United
States that year. She graduated summa cum
laude from Miami University (Oxford, Ohio) in
1973 and studied for a year on a University of
Iowa writers workshop. In 1977, she earned a
master of fine arts degree from the University of
Iowa.

Dove's poems began to receive national
exposure in 1974. Her first book of poetry, The
Yellow House on the Corner (1980) was followed
by Museum (1983) and Thomas and Beulah
(1986) all published by Carnegie-Mellon
University Press. her most recent book Grace
Notes, was published by W.W. Norton in 1989.
She also published a collection of stories, Fifth
Sunday, in 1985.

Dove joined the faculty at the University of
Virginia in 1989 as professor of English and a
fellow in the university’s Center for Advanced
Studies. In 1988-89, she spent the academic year
as a Mellon Senior Fellow at the National
Humanities Center in North Carolina and taught
for eight years at Arizona state University. Her
first novel, Through the Ivory Gate, is to be
published by Putnam in 1990.

Economist Walter E. Williams, John M.
Olin Distinguished Professor of Economics at
George Mason University, will speak at W&L
Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

A former weekly columnist for the
Philadelphia Tribune, Williams is currently a
nationally syndicated columnist with Heritage
Features Syndicate which is carried in roughly
90 newspapers. Williams frequently appears on
radio and television programs such as Milton
Friedman’s “Free to Choose,” WQLN’s “Star
Spangled Spcnders,” the WTBS Debate Series

“Counterpoint,” William F. Buckley’s “Firing
Line,” ABC “Nightline,” CBS “Face the
Nation,” “Crossﬁre,” and CNN’s “Larry King
Show.”

Williams makes frequent appearances before
congressional committees, such as the Senate

Labor Committee, Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, the House Ways and Means and
House Judiciary Committees. Heis the author of
numerous articles and four books: The State
Against Blacks (McGraw-Hill, 1982); America.‘ A
Minority Viewpoint (Hoover Institution Press,
1982); All It Takes is Guts (Regnery-Gateway,
1987); and South Africa's War Against
Capitalism (Praegcr Publishers, 1989).

The lecture is sponsored by Contact, a
student-run and ﬁnanced lecture series.

Gershon Winkler, popular author and
lecturer, will talk at W&L Monday at 8 p.m.
in Room 327 of the Commerce School. The
topic of Winkler’s talk will be “Madness in
the Bible.”

An ordained rabbi, Winkier is also a
songwriter, storyteller, farmhand, and
performer of bluegrass music. He is the author
of The Golem of Prague, Dybbuk, and The Soul
of the Matter. He lectures frequently on
campuses across the U.S. and Canada on Jewish
mysticism (Kabbalah), Jewish philosophy, and
Jewish concepts of love, sexuality, and mental
health. Winkier lectured last year at W&L on
Jewish mysticism.

From 1970-75, Winkier worked as an
editorial assistant for McGraw-Hill Book Co. in
New York. He later established several “Jewish
coffee-houses” in the New York area for Jewish
teenagers and founded The Jewish Connection, a
program of educational outreach to alienated
adults.

Winkler, who often appears on television and
radio talk shows, currently serves as director of
the Hillel organization for Jewish students at
West Virginia University and as chaplain for
inmates at the Kennedy center in Morgantown.

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee students for
years have jokingly referred to Lex-
ington as “Lex-Vegas,” poking fun
at the lack of amusements the town
offers outside the conﬁnes of the
university.

But some day, if Lindy Felix gets
her way, things may loosen up —
quite literally.

Felix, who calls herself a “mas-
sage therapist,” appeared before the
Social and Economic Services Com-
mittee of the Lexington City Council
Thursday night to ask that a $1,500
licensing tax on massage parlors be
changed to a revenue-based tax.

The committee promised only to

study the issue further, but Felix
believes massage parlors will some-
day be a reality in Lexington. “I
think massage is coming commonly
back into being,” she said. “I think
what the council said is they would
like to wait until there is some kind
of standard, and we're close to get-
ting a government standard for licens-
mg.”

Though Felix has a business li-
cense for Rockbridge County that
allows her to perform massages in
private homes, she would have to pay
the licensing tax to open an ofﬁce in
Lexington. She also does massages at
the Staunton Athletic Club.

Even though she is a massage
student at a state-certiﬁed trade sch-
ool in Charlottesville and has about
220 hours training, Felix has to ﬁght

Comer hearing
set for Tuesday

By Genlenne Mongno
Associate Editor

Charles “Blake" Comer, who
faces charges of hit-and-run and
manslaughter in the death of a W&L
freshman, will appear in Lexington
General District Court for a prelimi-
nary hearing Tuesday at 10:15 a.m.

Based on evidence presented at
the hearing, Judge Joseph Hess will
decide whether the case should be
sent to the grand jury.

Comer, 21, was arrested Nov. 31

and charged in the March 16 death of
Mary Ashley Scarborough.

According to W&L Director of
Communications Brian Shaw, Comer
voluntarily withdrew from W&L on
Dec. 3. Shaw said, if Comer applies
for readmission his application would
go before the school’s Committee on
the Automatic Rule and Readmission.

Lexington Police Chief Bruce
Beard said witnesses will be called to
testify at Tuesday's hearing but he
declined to release their names.

Beard said there may be more
arrests in the case.

38 candidates are left
to replace Dean John

By Kelly McCabe
Staff Reporter

Only 38 names remain on the list
of candidates to be Washington and
Lee's new dean of students.

W&L received 180 applications
for the position, according to Admis-
sions Director William Hartog, chair-
man of the search comniittee.  T ' '

The 38 remaining prospects have
been asked to submit letters of rec-
ommendation. “We’re awaiting these
letters before we take another step,”
said Hartog.

The committee placed an adver-
tisement for the position in the Sep-

tember issue of the Chronicle of
Higher Education, wrote the W&L
faculty and sent hundreds of letters
soliciting nominations for the posi-
tion.

The search committee consists of
Hartog, Vice President John Elrod,
W&L faculty members Samuel Ko-
zak, Thomas Williams, Joan Shangh-

F nessy, Philip Cline, Joseph Goldsten,
Kathy Koberstein, and students Jon

Sheinberg, Mary Alice McMorrow
and Michael Holton.

W&L’s current Dean of Students,
Lewis John, plans to take a one-year
sabbatical at the end of this academic
year before returning to teach full
time.

RENT

from page 7

When the amendment was passed in 1987, landlords could get a stay of
enforcement until June 1990 that allowed property owners to let more than
four unrelated people continue living together without having to comply with

the new provisions.

Stays of enforcement were granted, King said, to allow students who were
already living together to ﬁnish their tenure at W&L before the restrictions

began.

Ten stays of enforcement were granted after the ’87 law was passed. So
far, nine applications for a conditional use permit have been submitted in
anticipation of the July changes. All of those nine applications, King said,
were submitted by owners who had obtained stays of enforcement.

King did not specify how many years the conditional use permit will last
but said it will be long enough to make any changes necessary to comply

with the law worthwhile.

“The thinking is that if we’re going to require the property owner to
invest substantially to meet the standards,” King said, “then we ought to
give them some assurance that Ihey’ll be able to get some return on the

investment. ’ ’

King said he expects more large capacity house owners to apply for

conditional use permits.

"In keeping with other communities,” King said, “we’ve really relaxed
by 100 percent — if you want to look at it that way — the restrictions on

unrelated individuals living together.”

Lexington City Attorney William
O. Roberts said he fears “if the price
is right, anything goes.” Other com-
mittee members had similar apprehen-
sions.

Louise Moore, who heads
committee, said she was concerned
that changing the tax could encourage
illicit behavior if minimum standards
for certiﬁcation are not established.

Jarvis Hall, ABD Visiting Fellow
in Politics at W&L, spoke last Wed-
nesday night about “Non-Violent
Social Change” in Lee Chapel for
the first Martin Luther King Memori-
al Lecture Series.

Hall, who teaches the course
“Race, Class and Public Policy” at
W&L, said that his purpose was to
focus on the journey that King made
toward accepting nonviolence as a
social, political and philosophical way
of life. He said his purpose in his
speech was to communicate to [the
audience] the life and work of one of
the most important individuals ir1
history, to tell of the philosophy of
the powerless becoming powerful.”

The doctrines of Christianity,
Marxism and Gandhi were cited by
Hall as inﬂuential forces that shaped
the manner in which King formulated

contributes to the idea of massage
being an illicit thing," she told the
committee.“I do not do illicit mas-
sage.”

While she readily admits that it
would be impossible to police every

J establishment that might open if the

tax is changed, Felix said her way of
doing business has been and will
continue to be legitimate.

Her clients remain under a sheet
during the massage, Felix told the
committee, and she leaves when they
dress and undress.

“I would not risk my investment
[in massage training] by skirting the
law,” she said.

She charges $28 an hour for
athletic club members and $35 dol-
lars an hour for non-members. The
revenue-based tax she paid to operate

her business at the Staunton Athletic
Club only cost her $31 last year _ an
amount that covers income up to
$8,900.

Felix said opening a massage
parlor in Lexington under the current
licensing tax is not worth the invest-
ment. Business in Staunton is going
well enough, Felix said, that getting
the tax changed here “isn’t a press-
ing need for me."

If she could ﬁnd a health club,
clinic or doctor‘s ofﬁce in Lexington
willing to house and supervise her
business, she could avoid paying the
city’s tax. But she is wary of the
problems that could arise for potential
sponsors if many massage therapists
had the same idea.

Other area towns have even strict-
er massage regulations than Lexing-

Jrvis all speaks in Lee Chapel in oelebrion of Martin Lther King Day.

Hall purports non-violence

his idea of non-violent social change.

Hall explained the impact and
importance of the Black Church in
'the Civil Rights movement and how
it served as a refuge and a support
system for Blacks. He also stressed
the signiﬁcance of the courage of
those willing to die in the struggle
for “true” freedom in a time during
the sixties where “fear and intimida-
tion reigned in the hearts of blacks,”
and the slightest defense of civil,
rights on the part of those oppressed
people was seen as a stepping stone
to justice.

“The armual observance of the
birthday of Doctor King,” said Hall,
“seems to imply a comrnittrnent on
our part to emulate or strive for
[equality].’ ’

Hall told the audience that too
little attention is given to the broad
range of the dream, which meant that
schools and universities “must
change from the strict parochial
teachings of the past, to .those more

   

diverse, that reﬂect the mu1ti—cultural
make-up of our society.” Hall urged
the. young people in the audience to
“continue to dream,” and to be
prepared to look for social change.

Following the lecture, there was
as small reception in the Morris
House where Hall, accompanied by
his mother and wife, Rosalind, an-
swered questions about his political
studies and the lecture.

Jarvis Hall is a candidate for his
doctorate of philosophy from Duke
University in Durham, N.C. adn
specializes in American politics, com-
paritive politics, American public
policy and Black politics.

The lectures on non-violent social
change, which will appear annually,
are an effort on the part of the Mi-
nority Student Association and the

Lexington Ministerial Organization to

provide exposure of King’s philoso-
phy and ideas regarding social
change.

Masseuse out to get her hands on Lex

ton’s. The licensing tax in Roanoke is
$5,000, and Harrisonburg prevents
massage parlors from opening at all.

While many people connect mas-
sage parlors with an image of girls
named Trixie possessed of question-
able morals, Felix did not reﬂect that
stereotype. Plainly dressed and anx-
ious dispell any biases the committee
may have had, she repeatedly indi-
cated she had no intention of running
an illicit massage parlor.

She said later she thought the
committee listened to her with an
open mind.

King seemed to believe that
Felix's intentions were sound when
he jokingly said at the end of the
meeting, “If you're running an illicit
business, what's $1,500?”

W&L gets
grants for
minorities

From the W&L News Office

Washington and Lee University
recently received a grant of $113,139
from the Jessie Ball DuPont Reli-
gious, Charitable and Educational
Fund for the ABD (all but disserta-
tion) Teaching Fellows program for
minority doctoral candidates.

The grant stipulates that the
funded ABD position be in addition
to the one that is presently funded by
W&L and makes it possible for the
university to bring two minority ABD
fellows to the campus for the next
four years, beginning July 1, 1990.

According to John W. Elrod,
Vice-President for Academic Affairs
and Dean of the College, “This grant
is signiﬁcant because it enables
Washington and Lee to increase the
number of minority faculty in its
classrooms and makes it possible for
W&L to attract ABD Fellows from
some of the strongest graduate
schools in the country.”

The ABD Program at W&L is
designed to increase the number of
minority teachers on its faculty and
to provide minority doctoral candi-
dates an almost-unique economic and
educational opportunity to complete
the dissertation and achieve the Ph.D.

The program makes it possible for
the ABD Fellows who have com-
pleted their course work to come to
W&L for a full year at full salary,
teach one or two courses during the
12-week terms, and have no teaching
obligation in the ﬁnal six-week Spr-
ing Term.

For the duration of the academic
year the candidates receive travel,
secretarial and ofﬁce support.

Flu season descends upon campus

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

The ﬂu season is about to make
its annual descent on the W&L carn-
pus, a school health official said.

“We're just starting to see true
inﬂuenza,” said Dr. Jane Horton of
the Student Health Center. “The ﬂu
will be here shortly.”

“We thought we were going to
get off easy this year,” said Barbara
Johnson, a secretary at the health
center. “But more and more people
have been coming in during the past
few days.”

~ On Monday, 67 people visited the

health center, but only a half a dozen
were treated for inﬂuenza.

“We expect a rapid increase in
three to four weeks. February is
usually our worst month,” Horton
said.

Although many people think there
are two types, there is only one true
ﬂu. Strictly deﬁned, inﬂuenza is an
inﬂammation of the respiratory tract
combined with muscle aches, fatigue
and high fever. Its symptoms usually
last four to seven days. For the
elderly and people with pre-existing
health problems, the ﬂu can some-
times be fatal because for them, it
can turn into pneumonia.

The other ailment believed to be
the ﬂu is actually a gastrointestinal
virus that causes stomach cramps,

vomiting and diarrhea and usually
lasts for 48 hours.

“We’ve had more of the diarrhea
thing,” Josephine McCowin, a nurse
at the health center said.

A rapid increase in inﬂuenza
cases around the country is being’
seen earlier than usual this year.

Different types of ﬂu viruses
come around each year. The particu-
lar strain that is prevalent this year is
Shanghai ﬂu.

“Anyone who has not had this
type of ﬂu before is susceptible,”
Horton said.

The ﬂu is spread primarily
through casual contact with people
who have it. The healthy shake hands

own hands over their faces to blow

their noses or mufﬂe a cough.

“Hand washing is the best way
of avoiding transmission,” Horton
explained.

For those who have got the ﬂu,
Horton prescribes “rest, lots of ﬂuids
and Tylenol for the fever.”

Although a vaccine is developed
each year to protect people from the
strain of inﬂuenza expected in the
winter, Horton said that “not many
people take advantage of a vaccine
around here, even though we recom-
mend it."

Horton added that the health cen-
ter is still giving the ﬂu vaccine,
even though it takes six weeks for
the vaccine to have an effect.

“Any protection is better than

none," she said.

Generals’ shooting tells al

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

Basketball is a relatively simple
game to ﬁgure out. If you shoot the
ball well, chances are you’ll win. If
you don’t shoot well, then chances
are you’ll lose.

Case and point the Washington
and Lee basketball team in its three
games last week.

Last Thursday night, W&L had a
chance to avenge its only home loss
in the past two years in Ashland, Va.
against Randolph-Macon. Last Nov-
ember, the Yellow Jackets defeated
the Generals 71-63 in Lexington.

In that game, W&L, playing with
junior forward Ed Hart, shot 35 per-
cent from the floor, probably the
main reason for the loss. This time,
the Generals were without the 6’5”
small forward and they could ill
afford another 35 percent shooting
night.

The Generals didn’t shoot 35
percent. They shot worse. Twenty-
eight percent to be exact. And you’re
all smart enough to ﬁgure the result
of this game out.

Randolph-Macon held W&L to six
season-lows, among them points in
each half and a game (22, 25, 47
respectively), and shooting percentage
(28.6 percent). Only junior forward
Scott Alrutz stood out as a bright
spot. In 19 minutes of action, Alrutz
tallied seven points and a career-high
10 rebounds.

Said W&L head coach Verne
Canﬁeld, “I thought Scott did a good
job coming off the bench. He looked
aggressively at the basket and re-
bounded, and also did a good job
helping us out on defense.”

The loss left W&L 10-4, 6-3 in
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference. Junior center Chris Jacobs
led the way for W&L with 14 points
and 11 rebounds.

On Saturday against Division H
Queens College, the Generals looked
to get back on the winning track in
the friendly conﬁnes of the Warner
Center. To do so, the Generals need-
ed to shoot better than 28 percent.

Juniors Mike Holton and Craig
Hatﬁeld led the way with the as the
Generals showed that Thursday
night’s shooting was no more than a
bad dream. On the afternoon, W&L
shot a blistering 60.7 percent, and the
result should have been easy to pre-

dict, right? Wrong. The Generals
needed overtime to defeat Queens,
which is in its first year of men’s
basketball.

The Royals stayed close despite
W&L‘s seeming inability to miss
from the floor. In the second stanza,

Jacobs becomes 15th
to score 1,000 points

By Debbie Grove
Staff Reporter

If you had told people that Chris
Jacobs would be a 1,000-point scorer
in his junior season after averaging
only eight points a game his fresh-
man season, they would have laughed
you right out of the gym.

Now, halfway through his junior
season, Jacobs is doing all the laugh-
ing — and the scoring.

On Saturday, Jan. 20, against
Queens College, Jacobs became the
seventh junior and ﬁfteenth player in
school history to reach the 1,000-
point plateau. The last junior to reach
the 1,000—point plateau was Hall of
Fame inductee Skip Lichtfuss in
1972-73. ~

Sitting on 999 points coming into
the game, he reached the milestone
with 17:37 to play in the opening
stanza. It would have been a crime
for Jacobs to score the basket on
anything other than his patented tum-
around jump shot, and that’s exactly
how it happened.

Junior guard Jim Casey made the
entry pass, and Jacobs took care of
the rest, knocking down an eight-
foot turnaround to reach 1,000 points.

Said Jacobs, “I feel good about
getting 1,000 points, but the in-
dividual achievements don’t count for
much without the team winning.”

The game was stopped and Jacobs
was presented with the game ball and
a plaque by Athletic Director Mike
Walsh.

In his sophomore season, Jacobs
scored 520 points to help lead the
Generals to the regular season Old
Dominion Athletic Conference title.
Jacobs was also narried ODAC
Player-of—the-Year. He is the first
sophomore to be ODAC Player-of-
the-year.

Jacobs also was named to the first
team all-ODAC, first team all South-
Atlantic Region and honorable men-
tion All-America.

If‘ Jacobs can score 520 more
points in his career, he will move
into fourth place on the all-time
scoring list. Only W&L legends Dom
Flora (2,310), Jay Handlan (2,002),
and Mel Cartwright (1,800) would be
ahead of him.

So far this season, Jacobs has
scored 288 points, starting all 16
games. He has 1,032 for his career.
Earlier this season, against Salisbury
State, Jacobs scored a career-high 35
points.

After going 20-7 last year, both
Jacobs and the Generals are 11-5 and
struggling. After Tuesday night’s loss
to Hampden-Sydney, Jacobs is hoping
the team can get it back together and
make a strong showing to finish out
the season.

“I’m hoping I can help the team
pull together to make sure we got to
the ODAC Final Four. I want us to
win the ODAC tournament and ad-
vance into the NCAA toumament.”

Smith extends win streak to 17 in loss

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee men’s
swimrriing team lost its final home
meet of the season on Saturday to
Georgetown, 117-82, despite some
ﬁne individual performances.

"We swam well,” said_head
coach Page Remillard. “We’re com-
ing closer to the teams that used to
handle us.”

Noting that Georgetown has a
large squad, whereas the Generals put
only eight men in the water on Satur-
day, Remillard said, “When we rim
up against depth and diving, our
program is hurt. But we’re still
winning events."

Heading the victory list for the

men was sophomore Jay Srriith.
Smith won the 100-yard and 200-
yard freestyle races with times of
47.57 and 1:47.23.

Smith’s two first—place ﬁnishes
raised his unbeaten streak to 17 vic-
tories. All of his victories have
come in the 50-yard, 100-yard and
200-yard freestyle events. Smith has
already qualified for nationals in the
50-yard and 100-yard events.

Also earning victories for the
Generals were sophomores Doug
Brown and Chip Nordhoff and the
400-yard freestyle relay team.

Brown won the 500-yard freestyle
(4:55.99), while Nordhoff~ ﬁnished
ﬁrst in the 100-yard backstroke (58.2-
1). The relay team, composed of
Smith, Nordhoff, Brown and fresh-
man Chris Hagge, placed ﬁrst with a

time of 3:21.72.

Remillard also said that Hagge
and sophomore - Stuart Towns re-
corded personal bests on Saturday.
Hagge, who ﬁnished second in the
50-yard freestyle, registered a time of
23.58. Towns’ time of 4:25.88 in the
400-yard intermediate race secured a
second—place ﬁnish.

Saturday’s meet was the last one
for the men in Cy Twombly Pool this
season. The 54 Generals, who have
not competed away from home all
season, will head out on the road for
the ﬁnal four dual meets of the sea-
son.

“The men are in a position to
win the rest of their meets, but they
can‘t afford to miss a beat,” Remill-
ard said.

This weekend, W&L will travel to

Shephard College on Friday and then
move on to Gettysburg College for a
meet on Saturday. The Generals’ last
two dual meets before the Atlantic
States Championships will be at Rad-
ford and Mary Washington.

“We're turning the comer, and

now the season is heading into the

home stretch," said Remillard. “Our

workouts have to be good to prepare
us for the end of the season.

Said Remillard, “We go on the
road for the rest of the season, and
we start by going against Shephard
and Gettysburg. Both meets will be
close, but Gettysburg will be very
tough.

“I feel we're ready for the chal-
lenge if our health holds. Now we’ll
just have to do it.”

Hampden-Sydney 83, Washington and Lee 63. I’m ernbarrassed.
I never thought I’d hear myself say it, but I have to. I m embarrassed
by the way the Washington and Lee basketball team is carrying itself on

But I’m not the only one who is embarrassed. If you read the article
across the page, you probably saw how embarrassed head coach Verne

What is the matter with the team anyway? It’s just a simple question,
but no one I've talked to can seem to pinpoint an answer.

Back in September, we were looking at basically the same team that
won 20 games and the regular season Old Dominion Athletic Conference
championship. Only Lee Brading did not return, and he graduated.

What is so different about this year’s team? Why isn’t it playing like
it can? Why does W&L have five losses when we should have two at

The answer, I think, can be found in a few words. Emotion. Guts.
Desire. Simply put, does this team have the guts and the desire it takes

It all goes back to last season. The Generals ﬁnished 20-7, but they
started 19-3. The season ended in the Salem Civic Center in the
championship game of the ODAC toumament. Hampden-Sydney trounced
the Generals 87-66 in a game where it looked like only one or two

Call me crazy, but is it really just a coincidence that the Generals were
trounced Tuesday night by, guess who, Hampden-Sydney? Again, it
looked like only one or two players came to play. All of the Tigers came
to play. As far as they're concerned, if they never win another game,
they'll be happy as long as they beat Washington & Lee.

These aren’t the only two instances. A one-point loss at Bridgewater
came as a shock to most people. This was the Bridgewater team that lost
in Lexington by 21 points one month earlier. Absolutely no one showed

At Virginia Wesleyan, ﬁve players were benched because they weren't
concentrating on the task at hand. Against Emory, the team blew a lead
late in the game and lost by five. Against Eastern Mennonite, the
Generals have to win from behind after opening up a 21-point lead in the

It’s nothing complex, just guts. Do you have the guts to put it all on
the line three nights a week? Is that too much to ask?

Tonight against Emory & Henry, in a game which will in all likelihood
determine the rest of the season, the Generals will be faced with a
challenge that they are facing in all but three ODAC opponents. Emory
& Henry is playing the game knowing that they lost both games against
the Generals last season. Only Hampden-Sydney and Eastern Mennonite
beat W&L last season. Randolph-Macon wasn’t in the conference.

The Generals have seen it before, and they haven’t reacted. They beat
Bridgewater twice last season and once this year, but the Eagles handed
one to the Generals this season. W&L beat Roanoke thrice last year, but
the Maroons did not die this year. They gave W&L a scare before falling
by nine. So did Eastern Mennonite. It took four last minute free throws

People are out to get W&L this year, and they have yet to react.
Granted, they have played since the ﬁrst game of 1990 without 6—foot—
5 junior forward Ed Hart, but playing without Hart can no longer be
accepted as an excuse. Using his absence as an excuse would be taking
the easy way out, and good teams - teams with guts — don’t do that.

In the eight games since Hart has been out, only one player is scoring
better than he did before Hart went out. The team rebounding margin has

Pilkey getstwo victories as
fresh get valued experience

By John Neumann
Staﬁ‘ Reporter

The Washington and Lee wrestling
squad learned a valuable lesson last
weekend at the Newport News Ap-

’ prentice Toumarnent.

Junior co-captain Larry Pilkey
came up with the Generals only two
victories against an extremely high
level of competition.

W&L head coach Gary Franke
chalked up the weekend’s results as
a learning experience as every other
W&L wrestler, except for Pilkey, lost
two matches and were quickly elimin-
ated.

Franke said, “It was a good ex-
perience and we can benefit from that
and now we have to look to our own
invitational.” This weekend, W&L
will host the annual W&L Invitation-
al.

One aspect that Franke will work
on with his team is technical skill,
with special emphasis placed on
footwork. Said Franke, “We just
aren’t converting from on our feet to
the mat.”

The competition last weekend was
the toughest that the Generals have
faced or will face this year. There

were exceptional athletes participating
in the tournament and Coach Franke
commented, “The tournament built a
positive experience and this week will
not be as tough a tournament.”

Inexperience is still hurting the
Generals and the seven starting fresh-
men are still developing the technical
aspect of wrestling, but are gaining
the necessary experience with every
weekend.

Franke will not prepare his team
any differently for this weekend’s
tournament but will shake things up
a little when the Generals will prac-
tice with VMI once this week just to
give both squads a change of pace.

This Saturday at 10 a.m., the
Generals will host eight other teams
for the W&L Invitational. Joining the
Generals on the mats will be David-
son, Furman, Gallaudet, Haverford,
Longwood, Messiah, Newport News
Apprentice, and Scranton.

Franke is confident that “a number
of kids can place in the invitational
this Saturday.” -

The team has completed almost
half of its slate, and Franke expects
an up-beat second half. “We have
four good weeks left and we’re going
to make it as challenging( as we

can.

Freshmen Dudley, Sauers
bring sunshine to Twombly

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

Individual performances helped to
offset the 110.5-92.5 loss the Wash-
ington and Lee women’s swimming
team experienced last Saturday at the
hands of Georgetown.

Head Coach Page Remillard said
that, despite Georgetown’s victory,
W&L is progressing impressively
toward its goal of swimming a non-
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
meet.

“We seem to be days away from
that accomplishment. The swims are
producing just what we’re looking
for,” said Remillard.

Among the women who swam
outstanding races against Georgetown
is freshman Claire Dudley who broke
her own school record in the 400-IM
event.

Remillard also praised the efforts
of freshman Stephanie Sauers, sopho-

more Jodi Herring, and junior Sharon '

Coleman who all continue to contrib-

ute top-level performances.

Dudley won two races, the 100-
breast as well as the 400-IM. Sauers
was victorious in both the 50-and
100-free races. Herring brought home
ﬁrst place in the 1000-free.

“Now we’re hoping that every-
one will turn in her top swims. We
are getting closer and closer to that
time. An eighteen point difference in
ﬁnal scores is not disappointing con-
sidering the that Georgetown women
ﬁnished eighth iri the Nationals last

- year,” Remillard said.

W&L’s next swims on the road
against Shepherd College on Friday
and Gettysburg College on Saturday.

“They are always tough teams,”
said Remillard, “but the Shepherd
meet may be very close. they could
be vulnerable if we swim well and
have some luck.”

The loss to Georgetown left W&L
3-6 on the season. The Generals are
3-0 in ODAC competition and domi-
nate the best times in each event

again this season.

The teams then traded baskets

until Jacobs hit both Ends of a two-
shot opportunity to give the Generals
a 73-71 lead. Queens tied the game
at 73, but Holton put/W&L back on
top with 1:33 to play 75-73. Queens
tied the game again, and Holton
promptly untied it with just :46 to
play with two free throws.

With :16 to play, junior point
guard Jim Casey fouled Queens’
Marcus Stubbleﬁeld, and the fresh-
man responded by knocking down
both shots to send the game into
overtime tied at 77.

The overtime belonged to Hatﬁeld.
After Stubbleﬁeld gave the Royals an
81-79 lead, Hatfield tied the game.
Aikens then converted a three-point
play with 2:34 to play in the extra
session.

Hatﬁeld then scored two straight
baskets, both on offensive rebound
stick-backs, to give W&L an 85-84
lead'with :53 seconds to play. Hol-
ton iced the 87-84 win over Division
II Queens with two foul shots with
:08 left.

On the afternoon, Holton equalled
his career-high with 25 points, includ-
ing nine of nine from the free throw
line. Hatﬁeld continues to shoot with
amazing accuracy from the ﬁeld,
connecting on 12 of 15 shots for a
season-high 24 points. He also grab-
bed nine rebounds. Hatﬁeld is shoot-
ing 72.9 percent from the ﬁeld over
his last seven games (35 of 48).

Despite the win, Canfield is still
not pleased with the way the team
has played. “Last year, we had four
or ﬁve people overachieve each
game. We need that to happen this
season, and it’s not. Instead, we have
four or ﬁve players underachieving,
and only one or two playing as they
are capable.”

Last Tuesday against arch-rival
Hampden-Sydney, all that need be
said is embarrassed. That's how Can-
ﬁeld felt after the game, and that’s
how he thought the players should
have felt after the game.

Holton gave the Generals a 51-49

lead with 11:00 to play on a three-

point goal. From that point on, it was
all Hampden-Sydney, as Russell Tur-

ner came off the bench to score 26.

points on 10-of-11 shooting to lead
the Tigers to an 83-63 win in Lexi-
ngton. From the 11:00 mark, the
Generals were outscored 34-12. The
Generals shot just 43.1 percent for
the game.

Said Canfield, “I was thoroughly
embarrassed. I have never been so
embarrassed in my twenty-six years
at Washington and Lee University.
We got exactly what we deserved.
We didn’t come ready to play and
we didn’t react during the game.
Harnpden-Sydney deserves their win.
Absolutely no one played.well for us
and we didn’t play well at either end
of the floor.”

The loss left the Generals 11-5, 6-
4 in ODAC going into tonight's
game with second place Emory and
Henry. The Wasps sport the con-
ference’s leading scorer in Leon Hill
(24.9 ppg.) Game time is at 7:30 in
the Warner Center.

The game will be carried both on

radio (WLUR-FM 91.5) and tele-
vision. WJPR-Lynchburg (Lexington

delayed tomorrow night at 10:00.

gone from +6 to -1. Team scoring has dropped 10 points. When he went
down, Hart was averaging 11.9 points and 6.8 rebounds. Most
importantly, the team is» only 5-3 without him, 3-3 in the conference.

, Some of the blame has to fall on the coach. He must find
combinations that will plug the gaping hole that Hart left and play

successfully. So far, that hasn’t happened. Some players have played OK,
, most have not, and still others haven’t really gotten a good look.

We are not talking about a 0-16 team. This team is 11-5 playing with
the guts of a 0-16 team. An 0-16 team isn’t sure of itself and has no
reason to be. That ought to be far from the case with this W&L team.
That is what is most disturbing.

I’m a fan like the rest of the W&L community. We’re not asking for
the moon, just for a team that strives for it. A good fan is like a good
parent, expectations may be high, but not unreal.

The bottom line is this. It is gut-check time in Lexington, Va. Don’t

Businesses discontinue charging home

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

The student privilege of charging
home items front local stores has
recently been revoked by two Lex-
ington businesses.

The Sycarnore Farm Market and
the Lexington Hardware Company
have discontinued the practice of
letting students bill their accounts
directly home.

Betty Becker, co-owner of Syc-
amore Farm, said, “We just discon-
tinued charging home last week. Last
year, we didn’t have any problems
with students, but this year we have.

We have some bills that are four
months old.”

“We don’t let people charge
home anymore because lots of times
the parents wouldn't pay,“ said Ju-
nior Earhart, an assistant manager at
Lexington Hardware Company.

Although just about every store
admitted to having some problems
with individual charge accounts, most
stores said students are very good
customers. Spokesmen from Lloyd’s,
McCrum’s and the Whitefront Market
said allowing students to charge
goods home has deﬁnitely improved
their business.

The tradition of W&L students
charging merchandise or food home

is a long__ one. The College Town
Shop has allowed items to be billed
home since the store opened in 1926
and Alvin-Dennis has had a charge
program since it opened in 1963.

Jeff Kelsey, a W&L Law School
student who has worked at Alvin-
Dennis for four years, said his store
has an interesting system for collect-
ing delinquent accounts. “Student
employees who might know [the
offender] will call and remind him to
pay his account,” he said. “No one
has ever run out on a bill, to my
knowledge.”

According to Phyllis Miller, the
owner of McCrum’s, the charge pro-
gram she began ﬁve years ago is one

of the advantages her store has over
chain drugstores. She said that while
it has helped business “a lot,” the
store has had some problems with
students at Southern Seminary abus-
ing the privilege.

Anything the drugstore sells can
be charged home, she said.

Sam Moore, manager and co-
owner of Whitefront, said he hasn’t
seen any drawbacks to his charge
program. He said the program began
15 years ago, but has only really
been promoted in the last five or six
years. He did have one complaint,
however: “Not nearly as many stu-
dents take advantage of the program
as should [be doing so!]"

W&L grad hopes to
wrestle internationally

 

By Blair Simmons
Staff Reporter

John Lowe, class of ‘87, is trying
to raise enough money to compete in
an international wrestling competition
in Venezuela in July.

Lowe is associated with Athletes
in Action, a non-proﬁt Christian
organization that makes it possible for
athletes to compete internationally.

Lowe said he needs $3,500 to
train and compete in the Caracus
Cup. He said he will train for two
weeks in Colorado Springs and then
go to Venezuela to train for one
week before the competition.

Athletes are accepted into the
program on the basis of their athletic
ability and their reasons for wanting
to participate, said Lowe. He said
they are required to raise the money
for training, travel and living ex-
penses.

“It’s a great way to keep my
priorities in line,” said Lowe. “A
lot of times athletes get caught up in
trying to be successful and forget
what is important to them.”

Lowe, 24, said he will be wres-
tling Free-style in the Caracus Cup.
Free-style consists of take-downs
only, with no mat wrestling. He said
he also competes Greco-Roman.

Greco-Roman is mat wrestling
with all throws and no feet.

Having read about Athletes in
Action in wrestling magazines, Lowe
called Fellowship of Christian Ath-
letes national headquarters for infor-
mation last summer. FCA put him in
contact with Athletes in Action.

Lowe said he was attracted to the
program because Terry Cummings, a
professional basketball player, had

he plans to start running as soon as
daylight-saving time begins and will
train at the Naval Academy Summer
Wrestling Camp in June.

“I'm about the best at the state
level, and I was looking for ways to
get to the national level,” said Lowe,
who has been wrestling for about 11
years.

“For a long time I was very
mediocre at wrestling, but I haven't
been in a tournament in three years
that I haven't placed in,” said Lowe.

Lowe said his most successful
year wrestling at W&L was as a ﬁfth
year senior; he did not compete his
junior year.

In addition to being an athlete at
W&L, he was a Dorm Counselor, a
Ring-tum Phi sports writer and car-
toonist, a GHQ waiter, a member of
the FCA, a high school soccer refer-
ee, and a high school prayer group
leader.

Lowe majored in English and
Spanish and is currently teaching
drama, Spanish and English, as well
as coaching wrestling and tennis at
Easton High School in Maryland.

In 1988 Lowe placed second in
the Virginia Open and in 1989 he
placed second in the Mid-Atlantic
District Tournament and won the
Maryland State Games, he said.

‘ By Joel Dyes
1 Staﬁ‘ Reporter

Edltor’s note: Fiction writer John Updike gave a reading Monday in Lee
" Chapel. Updike, who is best known for his Rabbit, Run series and The
‘Witches of Eastwick, has won numerous awards for his work, including a
Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. At the reading, which was
‘sponsored by the Glasgow Endowment Foundation, Updike read several of
‘ his poems and ten pages from his latest manuscript, the fourth Rabbit book.
The following questions and answers were taken from a question and answer
I session after the reading or an interview with Updike Tuesday morning.
‘ Q: You said that someone brought up doing a biography and this inspired
,Self-Consciousness. Surely, a man of your stature has received this proposal
before. Why now? And why the six subjects you cover in the book?
‘ (Shillington, PA; Skin; Stuttering; On Not Being a Dove; Letter to Grand-
‘sons; On Being Self Forever)

A: It’s not really been often suggested that the biography be done. I can
only think of one case. It was a man in Pennsylvania, who had befriended
my mother. He seemed serious enough for me to take alarm and try to pre-
tempt his strike. As to why it’s in six chapters instead of consecutive...well,

I was trying really trying to write a kind of series of essays about being

myself, my life as I saw it and not just trying to give the facts which
1 anybody could do. It was an exploration rather than an exposition of my life

you could say.
A

. Q: On Page 65 of Self-Consciousness you said, "Nevertheless, however
liberal my views, I had no dealings with blacks either as equals or as
‘ servants and was shy and nervous about them. Then you go on to mention
,, at Harvard there were two, who had left by your junior year, at The New
Yorker there weren’t any nor were there any in Ipswich. Yet, in the letter to
4 your grandsons you mention your older daughter married a West African.
Was it hard to deal with when your daughter told you about this man she'd
fallen in love with, was it like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner revisited?

A: No. It really wasn’t. The guy appears to be such a good husband and

’ father and makes Liz happy. Also, I hope I’m a sufficiently good American
, and a good liberal not to be... Who knows what I really felt? But, I think the
main thing was my daughter seemed happy about it, and so we all were
I happy about it. And, she’s produced two lovely grandsons. And, you'll be
interested to know that whether modeling himself after her or not, my older
son has now married a girl from Kenya and just produced a half-African
~, Updike. So I have three grandchildren, all of them half-African. I'm an

\ African grandfather. It is true that the upbringing I had was a very all-white

small town conservative American upbringing. Shillington (Pennsylvania) did
,. not have many blacks, if any.

‘ Q: Did your mother inﬂuence your career at all?

is A: My mother died this October, I’m sorry to say. But I can’t even begin

‘- to guess how much she inﬂuenced my career. Certainly, even on the
conscious level, to see her trying to write and to see the envelopes go out
and come back gave me the idea that this was something worth trying to do.

9 Then as I aged and did begin to write, her own remarks were often quite

‘ helpful. But, she wasn’t overly helpful. She kind of had a nice touch, I
thought, with me as a writer and then, as a published writer there was a lot

I I wrote that she just as soon I hadn't written. But, she never complained.

‘ Above all the niceness as a human being, she also had pretty good taste, I
think. And her feeling for literature and words certainly inﬂuenced me.

Q.

Q: In an interview with William Styron last summer, he said writers, like
priests, are called to their profession. Do you agree?

:Assistant professor to be
§JMU composer-in-residence

A

The Fling-rum Phi, January 25, 1990

A: Bill probably has a slightly more priestly view of the profession than
I do. I did from quite early on want to do something creative, but I basically
drew initially. My first ambition was to be a cartoonist or an artist of some
kind. And that rather slowly evolved into being a writer which seemed to be
what I could actually make a living at. So, no, as a little fellow I didn't
think I was going to be a writer. But, I did want to do something where I
wouldn’t have to put on a suit and go to teach high school like my father
did.

Q: About sex. George W. Hunt said in John Updike and the three great
secret things: Sex, Religion and Art, “(For Updike) Sex is the closest to a
religious experience that the physical world provides.” He said that the
protagonist often searches for spiritual satisfaction in sexual encounters. Do
you agree with that?’ You have pretty explicit sex scenes. Is that to sell
books or does it have some higher meaning?

A: Father Hunt is, of course, a Jesuit and has his own slant on all this.
Certainly, sex is a vivid and mysteriously meaningful physical experience.
I've tried to describe it in the fiction in part because it was there to describe
and also I was attempting to show the personalities continuing through the
bedroom door as it were. I think sex is a human action like many another
and is entitled to maybe the same kind of coverage that other actions get. I
don’t do it as thoroughly now as I did in my thirties. Maybe it’s been done
by me and others enough for the time being.

Q: Are you a sports fan? Do you like basketball? How about the Boston Red
Sox? Do they have a future? Edltor’s Note: Harry Angstrom, the hero of
Updike’s Rabbit series, is a basketball star.

A: I’m a middling sports fan. There are many men and some women who
are more ardently involved in sports than I arri. As a high school kid, I
naturally was exposed to games and went to them. I wasn't a jock, but I did
certainly go to a lot of games including basketball games. And that gave me
my interest I suppose in ex-basketball players which has come out in a
number of forms. For some reason, in Pennsylvania, I did take a shine to the
Boston Red Sox. I think specifically Ted Williams. And one of the charms
of moving to New England for me was that I’d be near the Red Sox and
Williams. When he retired in 1960, I wrote my one sports article about it
and haven’t been quite has interested since. But, yeah, I follow them and go
to maybe two games a summer. They're a struggling organization at the
moment.

Q: In Newsweek, Peter S. Prescott praises everything in Self-Consciousness
except “On Not Being a Dove." He said that you do not take into account
that the resistance to the Vietnam war was many—sided and included shy
conservatives as well as the zanies. He goes on to write, “It’s astonishing
that a writer so sensitive to the tremors of our national anxieties should so
misread the great crisis of our time." How do you feel about his criticism?

A: Well, my whole, somewhat conservative feelings about Vietnam
troubled me at the time and still do. But I don’t think Peter is quite with
what I was trying to do. I wasn’t trying to justify anything. I was trying to
describe my own feelings and my own reaction and using my reaction which
wasn't a straight-down-the-line liberal reaction as an index for my own
political character. I wasn’t trying to write a history of the Vietnam conﬂict
or the resistance to it. I was trying to describe how I felt, and I think the
chapter stands perfectly well as an account of my own feelings. No, I wasn’t
too impressed by that remark of Prescott’s. But then one tends not to be
impressed by adverse critical remarks.

Q: How do you handle reviews?

A: Depends. The worst ones are the very intelligent adverse ones. The
ones that seem both intelligent and sort of anti the book. But, in the end,

A conversation with authorJohn Updike

you can only go ahead and do your own thing.‘I mean you can’t change the
book in question because it’s out. It’s done. You did your best. And as for
trying to change future books to suit this critic, I think you probably
wouldn't please him or her anyway. And, in general, so yes I do read them
sometimes, when I can’t avoid it. But you try not to clutter up you head
with too many reviews.

 One of my professors called you a prodigy. Do you feel like a
prodigy?

A: Not really. I'd been sending things to The New Yorker since about the
age of sixteen so I had had a certain amount of rejection. At college,
although I plugged away I basically was not in the top echelon of cherished
writers. I felt that my stuff had a faintly kind of faintly crass, edge; and I
came quite late to reading the modernist classics. So I was in many ways
kind of an uncouth ﬁgment at college. As you say, I got a couple of breaks
at the age of 22 and kept at it. But, you know, I've tried in a fairly hard
working way to capitalize on my breaks to exploit the opening once it
appeared.

The Ring-tum Phl, January 25, 1990

Born on the 4th of JuIy:a soIid“A”

By Todd Peppers
Entertainment Columnist

In the early nineteen-eighties the Vietnam war
was a taboo subject for Hollywood producers.
They claimed that the pain from the american
involvement in Vietnam would not translate into
box ofﬁce success. Oliver Stone’s “Platoon”
cleared away those misconceptions. The movie
was a harrowing, painful account of one soldier’s
numbing experiences in a war he could not
fathom. After the triumph of “Platoon,” the
Vietnam experience has become almost “faddish.”
Television offers its viewers “Tour of Duty,”
“China Beach," and “Letters Home.” The
movie theater counters with “Full Metal Jacket”
and “Casualties of War.” Several of these
productions admirably portray the war’s futility;
others ﬁt the role of cheap exploitation ﬁlms that
ignore the human condition and focus on violence
and gore. ‘i

“Bom on the Fourth of July" should be the
ﬁnal chapter to these movies and television shows.
While “Platoon” dealt with the horror of war,
“Bom on the Fourth of July” focuses on one
man--Ron Kovic--and the horrors of going home
again. Director Olive Stone started this flourish of
Vietnam story lines. I think it is only fitting that
he ﬁnishes it with a gripping tale of one vet-
eran’s struggle to “be whole again.” This is a
movie that you should not miss.

“Bom on the Fourth of July” is based on the
autobiography of Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic.
The war plays an important role in the movie, but,
unlike “Platoon,” Kovic’s war is not only fought
on the battle ﬁeld, but in a veteran’s hospital, the
home, and, ultimately, at the 1972 Republican
National Convention. Stone and Kovic offer us
the classic story of a human spirit that gathers up
life’s broken pieces and overcomes the odds.

Actor Tom Cruise is cast in the role of Ron
Kovic. He gives a magniﬁcent portrayal of a man
who feels betrayed by his family, his.friends, and
his country. Many critics have accused Cruise of
having limited acting abilities. “Bom on the Fou-
rth of July” forever destroys the “pretty-boy”
image created by ﬁlms like “Risky Business" and
“Cocktail". Cmise gives a performance that is
worthy of an Academy Award. The transforma-
tion from a young, patriotic teenager to a tired and
disillusioned veteran is utterly believable. I have
become a Tom Cruise fan.

Stone ﬁlms “Bom on the Fourth of July”‘s
ﬁrst scenes like a Norman Rockwell painting. We
are offered hazy, sun-dappled memories of life
when young boys played “war” in the woods,
love was a stolen kiss behind the schoolyard wall,
and fourth of July parades ﬁlled a tiny town’s
main street. Young Ronnie Kovic is more con-
cemed with playing softball and seeing the sol-

posed to make us uncom-
fortable. This one has a
message that many of its
contemporary movies can’t
wkn

Liers march than the affections of his grade-school
sweetheart. But youth blinds Ronnie to the fact
that the proud veterans who march in the fourth of
July parade left their arms and legs on foreign
battleﬁelds; they are battle—hardened warriors who
now ﬂinch at the sound of ﬁrecrackers. Here we
sense Stone’s adept foreshadowing.

Young Kovic is raised in a stem Catholic
household where his mother, (played with con-
siderable force by actress Caroline Kava) who
urges him to do his best because “that's all that
God cares about.” III the eyes of eighteen-year-
old Kovic, the best is becoming a United States
Marine and ﬁghting the evils of communism.
During a high school assembly Kovic and his
friends sit transﬁxed as a Marine recruiting ofﬁcer
(played by Tom Berringer in a cameo role) stands
before the young men and ﬁlls them with tales of
the glory of ﬁghting, and dying, for one’s country.
Kovic’s simplistic ideals of America are stirred by
this vision of ultimate patriotism and sacriﬁce.

But Kovic’s ideals are put to the test on the
battle ﬁeld when he realizes that not only the
“enemy” soldiers are dying from "the hail of
american bullets, but innocent women and
children. Kovic’s struggles become, not only the
surviving the ﬁerce ﬁre—ﬁghts, but also to hold
onto those proud ideals of arnerican glory and
democratic freedom that rang in his ears. He
seems to be losing the battle.

I think that Oliver Stone is most adept at
ﬁlming realistic battle scenes. Instead of rosy-
checked arnerican boys raising old glory in the
breeze, his scenes are gritty and devoid of color;
you can almost taste the dust of the dead land.
During the battle scenes his camera angles induce
a feeling of claustrophobia and confusion--the
audience is as surprised as the soldier when bullets
rain from the sky and leave broken bodies in their
wake. You want to leave the movie theater and
escape the tension, but Stone manages to pin you
to your seat.

We think Kovic’s trials are over, and retribu-
tion is paid for his sins, when an enemy bullet
severs his spine and paralyzes him from the chest

down. But Kovic’s hell is just beginning: Kovic
must survive a rat-infested veterans hospital, an
America that now mocks his patriotism, and a
family who carmot understand his rage.

The most powerful scenes in the movie occur
when Kovic returns home to his family. Cruise’s
performance is agonizing when he weeps in his
father's arms and asks “what woman is ever
going to love me, Dad?” His father, played by
actor Raymond J. Barry, is too overcome with
emotion to respond. The handsome young man
who fought to defend his country is dead; in his
place is a tormented, crippled veteran who simply
wants to “be whole again."

I must be careful and not create the illusion
that the ﬁlm is faultless. Many of the scenes are
disjointed and interrupt the smooth flow of the
story. And the movie loses its intensity when
Kovic journeys down to Mexico and joins a group
of veterans who are hiding their pain under a
cloud of drugs and prostitutes. William Dafoe,
another veteran of Stone’s ﬁlms, plays the drunk-
en “Charley from Chicago,” the leader of these
men. What is the purpose of this journey?
Furthermore, other characters, like Kovic’s high
school sweetheart, simply drop out of the plot.
Perhaps Stone failed to develop these characters
because he wanted to focus on Kovic’s misery.

The ﬁlm's running time, well over two hours,
is a tad long compared to other productions.
However any faults in either the screenplay or the
direction are overpowered by Cruise’s perfor-
mance. He IS Ron Kovic, and his ‘struggles to
“become a man again” will leave you mes-
merized.

“Bom on the Fourth of July” is not a ﬁlm
you will want to see more than once. I came out
of the theater with the sensation that Oliver Stone
and Tom Cmise drug the viewer to hell and back
along with Ron Kovic. Yet sometimes a ﬁlm is
suppose to make us uncomfortable, and “Bom on
the Fourth of July” has a message that many of
its contemporary movies can’t offer. Despite its
ﬂaws, and because of Cruise's performance, I will
rate “Bom on the Fourth of July" a solid “A.”

“Born on the Fourth of July” will arrive at
the State Theater next week. It is rated “R” for
language and graphic violence.

A Postscript: My review of “sex, lies, and
videotape” generated a good deal of controversy;
I think that a letter is appearing in the Phi this
week from a W & L grad who didn't agree with
my opinions. I enjoy the feedback from my
reviews, but want to point out that I am offering
only my opinions, not facts carved into House
mountain. I certainly miss the mark at times, (my
review of “Uncle Buck” for example) and I en-
courage Phi readers to go see a popular ﬁlm even
if they don't agree with my review. But I still
don't understand “sex, lies, and videotape”...

Charles “Blake” Comer will appear before
a grand jury Monday to face charges of hit-
and—nm and involuntary manslaughter, despite
his attomey’s attempt to get the manslaughter
charge dropped.

Comer, 21, told Lexington Police Chief
Bruce Beard on Nov. 30 that he was driving
the car involved in the March 16 hit-and-run
death of freshman Mary Ashley Scarborough.

At a preliminary hearing Tuesday, Judge
Joseph Hess ruled there was enough evidence
against Comer to send the case to the Rock-
bridge County grand jury.

Comer’s attorney, Thomas Spencer, had
asked Hess to drop the manslaughter charge,
saying there was not sufficient evidence to
show that Comer was driving in an irres-
ponsible manner or engaging in anything ille-
gal at the time of the accident.

Without such evidence, Spencer said, there
is no proof of the “willful neglect for human
life" necessary for a charge of involuntary
manslaughter.

At Tuesday’s hearing Beard read a tran-
script of Comer’s statement. In it Comer said
that at the time of the accident, which occurred
between 2 and 2:15 a.m., he was driving east
on Washington Street toward McDonald's.
Comer said he was’ going home and was alone.

Virginia State Trooper Cecil E. Bowen, an
accident reconstruction expert, testiﬁed that he
believed Comer was travelling west on Wash-
ington Street in the eastbound lane when the
accident occurred.

Bowen said the location of evidence found
at the scene, including Scarborough’s boot, two
blood stains and a tire mark, supported his con-
clusion. If Comer had been driving east, as
Comer said in his statement, the position of
these items would have been different, said
Bowen.

Commonwealth's Attorney Eric Lee Sisler
said he thought the evidence was more than
enough to support a charge of manslaughter.

I The Washington and Lee Board of
, Trustees will determine next year's
tuition, room and board and financial
‘aid policies during the board's meet-
,ing Friday and Saturday, said W&L
President John D. Wilson.
4 "The meeting will begin at 8:30
a.m. on Friday with reports from
‘ Executive Committee President Wil-
4 lard Dumas, President of the Alumni
Association John Kleindinst and Dean
' of the Law School Randall Bezanson.
, Dumas said he will give statistics

' ress and improvement due a lot to

— Blake Comer

“If that isn’t gross negligence for human
life then I don't know what is," he said.

Police said they were led to Comer in late
November after receiving a tip from an uniden-
tiﬁed Washington and Lee graduate. -

The tip led police to Comer’s home in
Greenville, S.C., where they were able to match
a horn cover found at the accident scene to
Comer’s mother's car. _

According to Beard, Comer denied involve-
ment in the accident during the original police
interview. After an hour of questioning, Comer
broke down and said he “wanted to tell the
truth about Ashley's death,” said Beard.

In his statement, Corner said he had been
driving his mother's car, an ’86 metallic blue
Honda Accord, the night of the accident.

He said Scarborough stepped off the curb
and “stumbled in front of the car.”

“I was petriﬁed. I wish I would have
stopped and gone back but I didn’t,” he said.

Comer said he drove directly home after the
accident and, after a few hours, decided to go
to Washington to repair the car. He said he told
no one about the accident.

“You don't know what it's like to have
taken the life of somebody young, somebody
that is really my age, and then think of every-
thing they will miss in life,” Comer said.

“I wish to hell it wouldn't have happened,
and I wish I had had the balls to step
forwar .”

The grand jury could refuse to indict or
hand up indictments on either or both charges.

If convicted, Comer could be sentenced to
up to ﬁve years in prison for hit-and—run and
ten years for involuntary manslaughter.

Comer was in his senior year at W&L when
he withdrew Dec. 3.

Students lose someprivileges by voting in Virginia

Assignment Editor

W&L students will be able to register on
campus to vote in the upcoming local elec-
tions this spring, but before signing across the
dotted line they should think about losing

. many of the privileges they now enjoy as

I

residents of their home states.
“The board does want all qualiﬁed citi-
zens to vote,” said Lexington Electoral Board

' President Bill Steams at the City Council

meeting on Jan. 18. “But ideally we hope the
students will make an informed decision for
themselves.”

In an effort to help students register to

I vote, Steams said the board is working with

Associate Dean of Students Leroy “Buddy”
Atkins to ﬁnd convenient locations and times
to set-up voter registration tables on the
W&L campus. Steams also told council
members of changes in voter registration

_ procedures at city hall after students com-

plained that they were being harassed when
they tried to register.

“In the past the registrar here has asked
some questions, but the law speciﬁcally states
you can't ask students specific questions that

you don't ask everyone," Steams said.
“Now, you can ask her [the registrar] ques-
tions but she won't ask you.”

According to Steams, the registrar has
been trying to determine whether students
were legal residents of Virginia, as required
by state law. This requirement of legal resi-
dency is at the center of a number of compli-
cations involved with students registering to
vote in Lexington. ,

According to Article 11 of the Constitu-
tion of Virginia, residence requires “both
domicile and place of abode.” By virtue of
having a room here at school, most students
can legally meet the place of abode clause,
but meeting the domicile part is a bit more
tricky.

Section 24.1-1 of the Virginia Code de-
ﬁnes domicile with 11 requirements. The list

includes working in Virginia, holding a local
lease and having personal property, such as a
car. Most students meet some of these qualiﬁ-
cations, but it isn’t necessary to meet every
requirement.

Both Steams and Virginia State Board of
Elections Secretary Sue Fitzhugh emphasized
that students are responsible for determining
whether they are residents of Virginia. Stu-
dents who are not Virginia residents but
register to vote anyway will be committing
perjury, which is a felony in Virginia.

Steams said that even if W&L students
can meet these qualiﬁcations, they should
realize claiming legal residency here means
they may lose legal residency in their home
state. '

Students will lose their right to vote in
hometown elections if they sign the oath on
the Virginia registration form, Steams pointed
out. The oath states in part, “I hereby autho-
rize the cancellation of any previous voter
registration held by me.”

Students may also lose coverage under

homeowners insurance policies, Stern said.
Homeowners insurance is what students turn
to for emergency money after their personal
property, like stereos and jewelry, is stolen or
destroyed. He added that homeowners insur-
ance policies generally include a clause stat-
ing that students away from home will be
covered by their parents’ policy as long as

‘they are residents of their parents’ homes.

An ofﬁcer at the St. Paul Insurance Co.
said students claiming permanent residence
outside of their parents’ home are covered,
but the coverage is limited to 10 percent.
Insurance ofﬁcer Rose Stevens said students
could purchase their own policies, which
would vary in price according to how much
property is covered.

Steams also pointed out that students
should think about graduate school before
registering to vote. Students claiming Virgin-
ia as their legal residence may not qualify for
resident tuition rates in their home state, he
said. However, Fitzhugh conﬁrmed that
students can be legal residents of Virginia

Speakers
to discuss
drug abuse

From the W&L News Office

Washington and Lee’s Health

Education Committee has planned a

~ variety of activities in conjunction

with National Collegiate Drug Aware-

ness Week, which will be observed
Feb. 5-9.

The keynote speaker for the event
will be Dr. Fred W. Frick, ‘74, direc-
tor of drug testing and clinical con-
sultant for the Women’s International
Tennis Association.

Frick will give a public address
on Monday, at 7:30 p.m. in Lee
Chapel. He will discuss the effects
of combining alcohol with other
drugs, the symptoms of drug abuse,
and drug and alcohol treatment pro-
grams. The public is invited.

During his visit to the campus,
Frick will also meet with W&L sci-

'ence students and with members of
the university's coaching staff.

Another Drug Awareness Week
program will be held Wednesday, at
7:30 p.m. in Lee Chapel, where two
attorneys from the Richmond ﬁrm of
McGuire, Woods, Battle, and Boothe
will discuss drug testing in the work-
place.

William Toorney and Scott Cairns,

‘ experts in the ﬁeld of labor and em-
ployment law, will speak about drug
testing procedures, new methods such
as hair and brain wave testing, and
legal issues affecting drug testing.

Renaissance faces zoning troubles

By Andrew Waters
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee officials scratched
from the Master Plan a proposal to close
Henry Street and said they would ask the
city to change its zoning laws to allow the
university to purchase property occupied by
fraternity houses.

President John Wilson, Capital Planner
Frank Parsons and three architects presented
the proposal as part of the latest version of
the university’s Master Plan to the Lexing-
ton Planning Commission last Thursday.

A new student center next to the Univer-

sity Library is also included in the Master
Plan. Parsons said the student center as it
exists today isn’t adequate because of
crowded conditions and because “it’s not in
the center of anything.”

The new student center would serve the
same purpose as the Co—op, which would
become a faculty center for the Commerce
school.“We hope in the next decade the
new student center will serve as a facility
that will draw students from the city and
county to be on campus,” Wilson told the
Plarming Commission.

Parsons said the building, which would
be built in the same low- profile manner as
the library, may include one or two parking

levels. The university also plans to add

parking to the corral and each fraternity

house to make the number of space! equal
to the number of students living in the
houses.

The Master Plan also proposes to include
all fraternity houses it renovates in the city's
institutional zoning district to avoid the
application process and time restraints of
individual conditional use permits. The
institutional district is the zoning district that
comprises university-owned land.

City law, however, prohibits fraternity
houses from being built in the institutional
district. Parsons said a change in the law

IFC, police meet to solve problems

By Chuck Broll
Staff Reporter

Lexington police ofﬁcials, Interfraternity
Council ofﬁcers and fraternity presidents
worked out some differences at the ﬁrst
Fratemity-Police Relations Committee meet-
ing last Thursday, IFC President Kevin Nash
said at Tuesday's IFC meeting.

The Fraternity—Police Relations Commit-
tee will meet every Thursday at 3 p.m. at
City Hall to further strengthen relations,
Nash said.

Nash called the meeting “a pretty good
thing to do” to improve relations with
police after a weekend when seven noise
violations were given out, one fraternity
president was arrested and police complained
of harrassment from fraternity members.

The police suggested starting parties

earlier, keeping sober people at the doors
and refraining from carrying beer cans
outside the parties and walking in the mid-
dle of the streets, Nash said. The police
also want to talk to someone in charge
when they stop at a fraternity house, prefer-
ably someone whose name is on the noise
permit, Nash said.

The police said sober drivers have

‘ brought the number of Driving Under the

Inﬂuence violations by W&L students “way
down,” Nash said.

Elections for the seven top Interfraternity
Council offices will be held in one week,
IFC Vice President Hunt Niedringhaus said.

Nominations were taken at the meeting,
but further nominations can be made by
placing a candidate's name and fraternity
afﬁliation in the IFC box on the second
floor of the University Center by 3:00 p.m.
Monday, Niedringhaus said.

The candidates nominated at the meeting
include Les Lewis and Goodloe Lewis for
the IFC presidency; Mike Skarda was the
lone candidate for vice president. For
secretary, the candidates are Dax Cummings
and Jonathon Symonds. Bill Hoehn and
Evan Balmer were nominated for treasurer.

Tom Costello was the only name men-
tioned for senior justice, and Bill Brinkman,
Jay McKnight, Thomas Otis, Clint
Wheelock, Rob Rambo and Greg Hicks
were nominated for the two junior justice
positions. _

Associate Dean of Students Leroy C
“Buddy” Atkins said he will begin to go
over possible plans for housing, food, party-
ing, rush and other topics concerning the six
fraternities that will probably be under
renovation next fall.

“We’ll set up a time where we can get
this stuff rolling,” Atkins said.

and still qualify for resident tuition rates in
some home states.

Steams pointed out that students may be
able to go to graduate school in Virginia at
resident tuition rates. However, resident rates
for graduate school in Virginia may not come
very easily. According to the Ofﬁce of Vir-
ginia Status for Students at the University of
Virginia, voting here for four years is not
enough to make you a resident in the eyes of
the people who collect tuition at UVa. Stu-
dents from out of state must also prove they
are ﬁnancially independent.

Even if students can claim they are legal
residents of Virginia, are willing to give up
the privileges of residency in their home
states, are willing to buy their own homeown-
ers insurance and realize they still are
out—of—staters to UVa graduate school ofﬁ-
cials, there is still one more fact to consider.

According to Lexington Mayor H.E.
“Buddy” Derrick, legal residency comes at a
price — taxes. But, if students want a voice,
he said their comments would be welcomed.

Revision doesn’t
mean better

The Conﬁdential Review Committee has submitted to
President John Wilson revisions to the University Policy
on Harassment and to the CRC’s procedures. Most of the
proposed revisions change vague terminology into more
speciﬁc but more encompassing guidelines.

Under the current and proposed regulations, the CRC
considers the question of intent to insult or offend, not
the actions or remarks that offend. To this end the
committee recommends adding this clariﬁcation:

Intent can be determined by consideration of all
relevant circumstance. Expressions or actions intended to
further intellectual inquiry or state an intellectual position
will not be considered harassment.

Notice how the committee believes it can dance around
the problem of First Amendment rights, where opinions,
sometimes offensive, are not only protected, but also
encouraged. The United States Supreme Court has on
several occasions supported the right of the individual to
express his opinion his way, regardless of how offended
those around him become.

Gregory Lee Johnson shocked and offended a nation
without even opening his mouth - he burned the
American ﬂag. Johnson had a deﬁnite opinion on
President Reagan's policies, but his opinion could hardly
be called an action to “further intellectual inquiry or state
an intellectual position.”

While unintellectual but intentional opinions that would
offend someone because of his race, religion or gender
seem unlikely to occur at Washington and Lee, it just
might happen. Regular misunderstandings that offend or
insult are usually worked out in Dean McCloud’s ofﬁce.
This first line of CRC procedure seems to work very
well. If, however, the accused and the complainant cannot
agree, the matter may be turned over to the CRC proper.

Like the Executive Committee, the CRC meets and
deliberates in secret for the protection of the accused and
the complainant. Unlike the EC, the CRC has no
provisions for notifying the student body if a student has
been dismissed from school, and there is no public

appeal. Even the faculty and administration are unaware
of when the CRC meets, or what action it takes.

Such a secret body can only serve to scare students '

into silence. The fear of an unknown body handing down
sanctions to a student for sharing his opinion can
signiﬁcantly chill the exchange of ideas, and that deprives
all of us of one of the primary reasons for attending
college — examination of new ideas.

A student found guilty of “intending to offend” could
be on the next bus out? of town ‘— and no one would ever
know. The CRC, because its verdicts are final, has the
ultimate authority and is accountable to no one, not even
the president. While the proposed revisions would be
improvements, the CRC is now, and would remain, a
deterrent to free expression.

Two law students defend...

MY VIEW
By John M. Faik’

In response to Mr. Neurock's article “Should
the EC Govern the Law School,” the answer is an
emphatic YES! Mr. Neurock’s commentary
concerning the way in which the Honor System
currently operates was flawed and offensive due to
its avoidance of any facts, realistic analysis or
elementary research. I found Mr. Neurock’s piece
to be strikingly similar to “yellow journalism” in
that it attempts to feed on fear rather than
encourage thoughtful and provoking discussion of
the Honor System. It is my informed opinion that
the Honor System works, and that those students
accused of honor violations whether they be
undergraduates or law students face a system that
is intentionally weighted in favor of the accused's
innocence.

In Mr. Neurock’s pursuit of “justice” for law

students he contends that the current composition
of the Executive Committee has a “fatal inability
to understand the workings of the Law School”
and is t.lius unable to be just in determining the
guilt or innocence’ of law students. This conclusion
is ﬂawed by its ‘failure to recognize that every
undergraduate member of the EC with rare
exception displays a great sense of responsibility,
duty and respect for the spirit of the Honor System
and its just implementation. While Mr. Neurock did
not intend to sound pompous, he succeeded by
implying that only a law student could judge
another law student's behavior as honorable or
dishonorable. I also found it instructive that Mr.
‘Neurock could not provide one hypothetical
example from a law student’s day to day activities
that would require such expertise in order to judge
such behavior honorable or dishonorable. Mr.
Neurock makes clear in his commentary that he
has no problems with the EC’s ability to allocate
and budget a sizeable student body treasury, but in
matters of honor the Law School needs its own
Honor Council. If undergraduate EC members can
act responsibly in this very important process, what
is it about matters of honor that make them so
deficient?

I believe that Mr. Neurock's real motive is to
establish a Law School Honor Council that would

If the Law School developed
its own Honor Council, law
students would be more at
risk of unjust results.

not operate under current notions of an Honor
System but rather operate under a Uniform Honor
Code. Mr. Neurock’s real concern about the current
Honor System rests on his uneasiness over the lack
of black and white lines" that define all honor
violations in clear, unambiguous statutory language,
with clear jurisdictional and venue requirements.
Mr. Neurock, the reason that the Washington and
Lee University Honor System has operated
successfully for 125 years is that it is premised
upon evolving notions of honorable behavior as
deﬁned by the current generation's implementing
the Honor System, rather than a rigid unbending
Uniform Code that would be dated the day after it
was drafted.

Mr. Neurock states correctly that honor violations
are to be judged by our peers. In this regard, law
students are able to elect three classmrepresentatives
to the EC but also have the right to vote on the
presidentgvice-president, and secretary of the EC.
Law students should not be deceived by Mr.
Neurock’s bold assertion that they have no impact
in the composition of more than two—tliirds of the
EC. Thus, assuming that a law student is brought
before the EC in the investigation of an honor
violation, that person has had a voice in selecting
part of the two thirds required to convict a student
of an honor violation.

Further, if the law student appeals to a Student
Body Hearing, his advocates will be law students
skilled in representing those accused of honor
violations, in addition to participating in the
selection of the student body jury drawn randomly
from both law and undergraduate students. It is my
belief that the current Honor System strikes the
correct balance by ensuring that an honor violation
will be carefully examined by students familiar
with the accused's environment as well as students
less familiar but importantly disinterested from that
environment.

I do not believe that Mr. Neurock’s identiﬁed
problems are real problems, but even if they were
concerns, I don't believe they warrant the traumatic

and unrealistic solution ‘of the Law School
operating its own Honor Council. Mr. Neurock
provided only a sketchy outline of his proposal
without addressing the very real difficulties in
attempting to implement such a solution. It is my
belief that if the Law School developed its own
Honor Council that law students would be more at
risk of unjust results, due to the very real inability
of such a body to judge the behavior of law
students in an unbiased, disinterested and jv
manner.

The White Book states that “we do not think .t
is too much to ask that students do their own
work, Jepresent themselves truthfully and claim
only that which is their own.” I do not believe
that the Honor System places too heavy a burden
upon the behavior of law students, for if it- does
how are law students going to be able to meet the
burden placed upon an attomey’s behavior by the
bar as deﬁned by the Model Code of Professional
Responsibility?

Aside from my perspective of Mr. Neurock’s
comments and proposal, I have always been an
advocate for positive change where change is
warranted and likely to achieve the identiﬁed goals.
I strongly encourage both law and undergraduate
students to become more fully aware of the way in
which the current Honor System operates and their

own responsibilities under the Honor System. I’

urge all students to invest the time and energy to
offer informed and responsible proposals to
improve the present Honor System All students
are able to propose revisions to the Honor System
as delineated in the White Book by presenting such
proposals directly to the EC. Additionally, the EC
establishes White Book revisions committees every
four to ﬁve years for the purpose of re—evaluating
the Honor System. In terms of my own
recommendations, I would offer two relatively
simple proposals. The first is that the EC, the
Student Bar Association and the Law School's
administration take a more active role in educating
law students about the Honor System and its
commensurate responsibilities. Second, I would
propose that the Law School admissions process
take additional steps to make those students
considering Washington and Lee more aware of the
Honor System before they accept the invitation to
join our community.

Association.

MY VIEW
By Jeff Kelsey

As a member of the undergraduate
class of 1989 at Washington and Lee
and a member of the I992 law class,
I read with great interest Mitch Neur-
ock's article concerning the Executive
Comrriittee and its ability to govern
honor violations in the Law School.
Mr. Neurock contends that “the
Executive Committee is unqualiﬁed to
act on honor matters concerning law
students,” then proceeds to list rea-
sons why undergraduate members of
the EC are incapable of handling Law
School honor violations. He uses two
basic arguments to support his thesis.
First, undergraduates carmot possibly
conceive of what law school is like
and, therefore, carmot tell if certain
actions constitute an honor violation
within the law community. Also,
undergraduates are far too young and
immature to be considered peers of
law students and are mere
“outsiders” who should not be al-
lowed to “pass judgement in matters
about which they know little or noth-
ing.” I contend that Mr. Neurock, in
his ﬁrst semester at W&L, has
missed the whole point of the Honor
System and that his arguments are
faulty and insulting to the under-
graduate EC members.

First, I ﬁnd it incomprehensible
that he could write such a lengthy
article about the Honor System and
not refer once to the White Book.
We all know that the Honor System
covers lying, cheating and stealing.
These guidelines give the EC the
ﬂexibility to expand the notion of

honor without codifying a massive set
of rules and regulations. Yet, the
rules are simple enough for a student
to apply them to almost every con-
ceivable situation. Iri the ﬁrst para-
graph of his article, Mr. Neurock
asks, “How do we decide whether
the conduct of an accused is sufﬁ-
ciently bad to warrant so severe a
penalty as expulsion?" The question
itself reveals the author's lirriited
knowledge of the Honor System.
There is no sentencing evaluation in
an honor trial. Only one possible
sentence exists if the accused is
found guilty: expulsion. The EC
determines whether an honor violation
has occurred as deﬁned in the White
Book. All cases do not ﬁt neatly into
the three basic categories; however,
each EC representative is elected,
presumably, because of his reputation
as an honorable person. It is in these
shades of gray where we rely most
heavily on our elected representatives.
Each representative has to use his or
her own idea of honor in deciding
the case. Mr. Neurock believes that
the undergraduate members do not
possess the “expertise” required to
decide these cases if a law student is
involved. I disagree. Those students
are members of the Washington and
Lee community; that is all the exper-
tise which they require. I do not
think the personal integrity of an
undergraduate student can be ques-
tioned merely because of his age or
his connection with the Law School.
Honor is a concept which does not
have an entirely different meaning
simply because one crosses the foot-
bridge.

Mr. Neurock argues that while it
is “not overly problematic” for an

undergraduate EC member to place
himself in the shoes of an under-
graduate accused, it is extremely
difﬁcult for that same EC member to
imagine himself in the place of a law
student accused. These under-
graduates, Mr. Neurock writes, “have
a fatal inability to understand the
workings of the Law School com-
munity and are in no position to
judge the guilt or innocence of any
of its members.” He seems to fear
that situations considered acceptable
in the Law School will result in a
guilty verdict by an undergraduate EC
which does not understand the cir-
cumstances. I ﬁnd this idea ludicrous
for two reasons.

First, any potential honor violation
in the Law School would be reported
by a law student or law professor and
would be reported to a law EC rep.
Thus, any situation considered nomial
behavior by Law School standards
would not be reported as an honor
violation.

Second, I can think of no set of
circurristances which would be con-
strued as honor violations on the
undergraduate campus while con-
sidered acceptable in the Law School.
Despite his implications to the con-
trary, the Law School works basically
the same as the undergraduate side.
And Mr. Neurock offers no examples
of such a situation.

Mr. Neurock next argues that the
three law representatives on the EC
carmot adequately represent the law
student who must appear before a
closed hearing. He maintains that the
undergraduate members of the EC are
incapable of “independently judging
whether the conduct of the accused

was reasonable under the circumstan-

ces,” and that mere input by the law
representatives is not enough. I be-
lieve he is entirely incorrect. No
double standard of honor should exist
between the Law School and the un-
dergraduate schools. As I noted
above, one of the great beauties of
the Honor System is its simplicity.
Any student can apply it to any situa-
tion. There is no basis for saying that
an undergraduate cannot judge an
honor violation in the Law School,
and it is insulting to those representa-
tives to imply otherwise.

Mr. Neurock also argues that
undergraduates should not be allowed
to judge law students because they
are not true peers. He says, “Law
students may justiﬁably resent being
judged by outsiders, and especially by
outsiders who are only 18 years old.”
The idea that undergraduates are
“outsiders” is incredibly condescend-
ing and pretentious. The “W&L
community” refers to everyone on
both sides of the footbridge and even
includes the town of Lexington in
certain instances. No one in this
community can be considered an
outsider to the Honor System. To
presume that 80 percent of W&L's
students are outsiders simply because
they are not in the Law School is the
height of arrogance.

In conclusion, the undergraduate
EC members take their positions very
seriously, and Mr. Neurock does them
a grave disservice when he says that
they are incapable of delivering fair
decisions in cases involving law
students. I believe the system works
on both sides of the bridge, and that
splitting the EC into two distinct
groups can only harm the Honor
System in the long r1rn.

EC hands SAB surplus

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

A unanimous Executive Commit-
tee vote Monday carried the Student
Activities Board's fall-term surplus to
winter term.

The SAB ended last term with
about $10,000 of its $15,000 fall-ter
in entertainment budget unspent. The
EC last week allotted $250 of that
sum to Lip Synch. The surplus" now
supplements the SAB’s designated
$10,000 winter-term entertainment
budget.

SAB Chairman Charles Conkliri
and Treasurer Kathleen Duwel told
the EC that the SAB has spent about
$3,000 so far this term on the Bone-
shakers concert, the Mad Hatter com-
edy show and last Friday's Bingo.

Duwel reported that the SAB will
co-sponsor the bands performing for
Superdance this weekend, and on
Feb. 14 will bring Derry Berry and
Alagia to the General Headquarters
for a Valentine’s Day concert.

Bands for the Wednesday and
Thursday prior to this year’s March 9
Fancy Dress have not yet signed,
according to Duwel, though the SAB
is negotiating with the Charlie Dan-
iels band for a show Thursday.
Duwel said the expanded SAB
winter—terrn entertainment budget will
allow for more attractions, especially
in the General Headquarters, but
added that the SAB is taking care not
to contract until FD expenditure ﬁg-
ures are more concrete.

“We are going to look at bands

for after Fancy Dress," said Duwel,
“but before we sign anything we’re
going to [establish] how much we
spent on Fancy Dress.”

If FD pays for itself as planned,
then Duwel foresees a variety of
SAB-sponsored events for the months
after the ball.

The SAB will likely request in
spring that any winter-terrn surplus be
carried over to the spring, according
to Duwel.

Conklin told the EC that the
response to SAB activities this year
“has been very positive [and] will
continue to be very positive.”

In addition, Conklin said the in-
ﬂuence of this year’s EC-imposed
restrictions on SAB meetings has
been generally positive. He noted
that one SAB member said more
people get a chance to speak at SAB
meetings now.

Conklin said, however, that the re-
strictions have lengthened both the
SAB’s meetings and its decision-
making process.

The EC also heard a budget
request from B.J. League and Connie
Papazickos on behalf of fast- pitch
women's softball.

The group received $500 of the
$859.40 they requested from the EC
to purchase equipment to start a
team. The money, according to
League, will go toward the purchase
of bats, balls, bases and helmets from
the same wholesaler that the physical
education department deals with.

“Part of the [financial] problem
is that you need so many of the
things,” said Papazickos in reference

to the equipment necessary to start
the team.

Associate Professor of Physical
Education Joseph Lyles said univer-
sity policy does not allow the loan of
university equipment to club tearris.

“If you do it for one, you have
to do it for everybody else,” said
Lyles.

To cut costs, League said play-
ers will be expected to provide their
own mitts, bring additional bats if
they have them, and contribute dues
of about $10 each for transportation
and umpires. League and Papazickos
said they intend to approach city
merchants to sponsor uniforms.

Papazickos said the EC told her
to investigate the response from mer-
chants and if additional funds are still
needed to make another request. '11’:
team will concentrate more on having
a good time than winning, said Papa-
zickos. She hopes that more women
will sign up as the team gets started,
and encourages veterans as well as
first-time players to join.

Mock Convention also came
before the EC this week for its bud-
get hearing. EC Vice President Jona-
than Sheinberg said Mock Convention
received $4,000 this year to add to
its reserve for the 1992 event, and a
$500 operating budget to aid in prep-
aration.

Petitions of at least 150 signatures
for the EC’s “Big Three” offices of
president, vice president and secretary
are due Monday by 5 p.m. 5 p.m.
The election will take place on Feb.
12, and any run—off would be Feb.
15.

DG seeks changes in colonization

By Allsann McGloin
Staff Reporter

Delta Gamma Women's Fraternity
requested Wednesday that the Pan-
helleriic Council consider conditions
under which they might rush in order
to colonize successfully following
their decision to delay colonization.

Although sixteen women attended
Delta Garnrria’s interviews and party
last Wednesday night, their represen-
tatives did not think this was a suffi-
cient number to compete with the
existing sororities.

Despite the suspension of Delta

group of women still interested in
participating in DG's rush.

Jane Lee Joyce, Panhellenic Presi-
dent said Delta Gamma has expressed
interest in returning next fall to hold
rush for upperclass women at the
same time as men’s fraternity rush.

Associate Dean of Students and
Dean of Greek Affairs, Leroy C.
“Buddy” Atkins, encouraged the
Panhellenic Council to submit to each
established chapter for vote a propos-
al for Delta Garrima’s colonization.

“I think you need mother group,“
Atkins said, "there actually may be
more interested women out there than

day night.

“If we had had any idea that we
were going to have 250 percent more
of the girls signing up (for Rush)
than expressed interest we would
have started with five, not three
groups," he said.

The Panhellenic Council also
approved a reduction in the ideal
chapter size, lowering it from 75 to
70 women.

A recent Panhellenic survey sho-
wed that 75 percent of active sorority
members think the chapters have
become too large. After the first

“The university expects to invest
no less that eight million dollars in

university’s position is that such an

by the extension of the institutional

Members of the Planning Com-

about extending the institutional dis-

For the Washington and Lee wres-
tling team, the formula is quite
simple. Mix consistency from the
experienced wrestlers and excellent
performances from the freshmen, and
the results will be pleasing.

At least they were last weekend in
the Washington and Lee Invitational.
W&L used the experience of junior
co-captain Larry Pilkey and sopho-
more Peer Soderberg and the youth
of fresh Rich Paini, Doug Lamb and
company to bring home fifth place in
the nine team event.

Head coach Gary Franke thought
the team could have placed higher,
butwas still pleased with the success.

Pilkey, wrestling at 126 pounds,
advancedlall the way to the ﬁnals
before dropping an 11-7 decision to
Sean House, also of Longwood Col-
lege. Pilkey continues to be the
team's most consistent wrestler, and
although he was disappointed that he

SPORTS

lost in the ﬁnal, Franke acknowledged
his ﬁne performance.

Soderberg easily won his first
match, 14-3, before losing in the
second round The 167-pound soph-
omore bounced back to gain a third
place in the consolations.

At 118 pounds, Paini wrestled
extremely well, losing only to even-
tual champion Kevin Haller of Long-
wood College. Paini recorded two
pins, one just 15 seconds into the
match, on his way to winning 6-3 in
the consolation finals to grab third
place. Paini evened his overall season
record to 4-4.

Lamb grappled his way to a 7-5
victory before being ousted by the
eventual runner-up in the 134-pound
class. Lamb failed to place after
being just one point away from the
ﬁnals. Senior co-captain Lee Garlove
recorded an 8-2 victory before he lost
to the eventual runner-up at 142
pounds.

150-pounder Cary Potts, another
freshman, rebounded after an initial
defeat and recorded an 11-2 victory.

Generals find relief in road win;
look to regain early—season magic

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

“We found a new way to spell
relief, and that’s W-I-N,” said Wash-
ington and Lee head basketball coach
Verne Canfield after the Generals
snapped a three-game Old Dominion
Athletic Conference losing streak last
Saturday night at Lynchburg College,
79-67.

Having dropped consecutive con-
ference games to Randolph-Macon,
Hampden-Sydney, and Emory &
Henry, W&L looked as if the ship
was sinking quickly, but according to
Canﬁeld, a seven- minute stretch in
the second half of the Lynchburg
game has got the team back on track.

“We played better against Lynch-
burg. There was a six or seven min-
ute period where four guys off the
bench played with [junior forward]
Craig Hatﬁeld probably the best
defense we’ve played in quite some
time.”

stretch were freshman guard Bryan
Watkins, junior guard Andrew Man-
son, junior center Scott Alrutz and
sophomore forward Courtney Penn.
The unit was responsible for 10 steals
throughout the game. Penn and Wat-
kins each had three.

Canﬁeld was also pleased with the
way the team was able to work the
offense and reverse the ball. “We
worked our offense better because we
reversed the ball, and guess what, our
shooting percentage was better be-
cause of that."

On the night the Generals shot 52
percent from the ﬂoor, including 61
percent in the second half. W&L’s
defensive pressure forced the Hornets
into 22 turnovers and 41 -percent
shooting from the ﬁeld.

W&L was led in scoring by jun-
ior center Chris Jacobs’ 18 points.
Junior point guard Jim Casey chipped
in 16 on four—of-six shooting along
with seven assists. Hatﬁeld totaled 13

points, hitting all four of his shots.

Watkins finished with seven points
and Penn added six rebounds. _

The win came just two days after
the Generals second straight home
loss, this one coming to Emory and
Henry 84-68.

In an effort to shake up his team,
Canfield benched the regular starting
line—up of Holton, Casey, Hatﬁeld,
Jacobs and sophomore Mark Melton
and went with some new faces. The
frustrated Generals’ mentor called on
Manson, Penn, Alrutz, junior guard
Pat Gallavan and sophomore center
John Witherington to get W&L off
on the right foot.

For Penn, it was a doubly tough
assignment. Making only his second
start, the 6-4 sophomore was also
asked to guard the ODAC’s leading
scorer in Leon Hill, who came into
the game averaging 24.9 points a
game.

The Wasps jumped out to a quick
4-0 lead, but Gallavan sparked the
Generals to a 7-7 tie with ﬁve points.

Freshman Claire Dudley and
sophomore Jay Smith have a lot
in common. Both hail from
Florida. Both are pre-med
majors. Both are student—athletes
’ in the truest sense of the word,
each maintaining an excellent
grade-point-average. And both
are having outstanding seasons for
the Washington and Lee swim-
ming teams.

During the month of January,
Dudley qualiﬁed for the national
championships in 200—yard breast-
stroke, setting a school records in
that event and two more in the
200-yard and 400-yard individual
medley.

Smith, who competes in 50-
yard, 100-yard and 200-yard free-
style events posted a January
record of 10-0.

For their accomplishments,
Dudley and Smith have been
named The Ring-tum Phi Athletes-

of-the-Month for January.

Dudley’s time of 2:34.45 in
the 200-yard breaststroke ranks
second in the nation this season
and shattered the school record
she had set in December. She
also owns the school record in
the 100-yard breaststroke
(1:l1.14).

Smith, a 1989 honorable men- 1
tion Division III All-American
and an academic All-American,
qualiﬁed for the national cham-
pionships in the 50-yard and 100-
yard freestyle events at the end of
November.

This season Smith has not lost
an individual race, compiling a
21-0 record. He currently ranks
fourth in the nation in the 50-
yard freestyle and fifth in the
nation in the 100-yard freestyle.

Smith, who originally swam
backstroke in high school but
started to specialize in sprint races
last season, holds the conference
record in the 100-yard backstroke.

Focusing on his long-term

  ‘ATHLETES-OF-THE-MONTH‘ 2

goals, Smith said he would like to
finish in the top eight in both his
events at the national champion-
ships in March and earn school
records in the 50-yard and the
100-yard freestyle.

Smith, who is a freshman
dorm counselor, also plays on
W&L’s water polo team in the
fall and was selected for the all-
state team during the Virginia
Championships.

. Smith said he trains for the
season by playing water polo,

' swimming, running and biking.

“I've been a lifeguard for the
past two summers and that gives
me plenty of opportunities to
train,” he said.

Whenever he's not studying or
swimming laps in the pool Smith
said he likes to read, listen to
music and hang out with friends.

V At that point Carifield began rotating

‘ his regular starters back in the game.
Emory and Henry then sprinted
, out to a 36-17 lead with 5:08 to play
with a balanced rim led by six points
.. from Hill and ﬁve from Cary Perkins.
W&L closed to 10 at 38-28 with
2:16 to play 2:16 on a run sparked
by ﬁve points from Holton. Craig
McLaughlin then scored seven points
in the last two minutes of the half,
including a lay-in at the buzzer to
give the Wasps a 47-32 lead at the
half.
The Generals started strong in the
second half and closed to ten, 53-43,

- on Jacobs’ slam dunk and free throw

with 15:35 to play. At this point the
crowd was in the game and it looked
as if the Wasps needed to take time
to regroup.

But E&H withstood the W&L run
and went on a run of their own,
exploding out to a 77-56 with 4:43 to
play on a basket by Derek Elmore,
who had six points during the run.

Perkins scored 17 points on six-
of-seven shooting to iead the Wasps.
Hill finished with 16, a season low.
He managed just four of his 16 while
being shadowed by Penn.

Jacobs led W&L with 20 points
and Holton was the only other

General in double ﬁgures with 10.

Shooting and ball-handling told the

’ story. Emory and Henry shot 55

percent from the ﬁeld and had 21

I turnovers, while W&L shot just 39

percent and had a season-high 25
.tumovers.
“Emory and Henry played the

rriostgaggressive man-to-man defense

in quite some time," said Cariﬁeld.
“They did a nice job of taking us
out of our offense and we com-
pounded matters by not reacting."
On Tuesday, the Generals stepped
out of the ODAC and travelled to

' Greensboro, NC. for a game with
~ NAIA foe Guilford. The Quakers shot

a blistering 81 percent from the ﬁeld
in the first half (73.5 overall) and
opened up a 42-34 lead. In the ﬁrst

, stanza, W&L shot just 39 percent.

W&L closed the game to 42-38 to
start the second half but never got
any closer as Guilford forced W&L
into 24 turnovers on their way to a
95-80 win. Jacobs continued to lead
the Generals offensively with 31
points. Casey was the only other
General in double ﬁgures with 11.

From W&L Sports Information

In the first full-scale indoor
track action of the season at the
Lynchburg Invitational, Wash-
ington and Lee claimed three
individual victories.

Senior pole vaulter Phillip
Sampson battled through a
shoulder injury to take first place
with a vault of 12-6. Junior Carl
Gilbert brought home top honors
in the triple jump with a leap of
44-11.

Said men’s head coach Norris
Aldridge, “For this early in the
season and with very little prac-
tice time, I thought we ran well.
It was a good showing. We didn’t
do anything great, but we were
very good for this time of year."

For the women, junior Sarah
Bolte broke her own school
record in the high jump with a
jump of ﬁve feet, three inches
and took first place in the event.

year’s first

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee men's
swimming team split its first two
road meets of the season this past
weekend, defeating Shepherd College
56-28 and losing to Gettysburg 105-
96.

“It was a fun trip," said head
coach Page Remillard. “I was
pleased (with the results). We‘are
continuing to make improvements and
I think we’re in a good position for
the rest of the season.”

During the weekend sophomore
Jay Smith won four races, extending
his unbeaten streak to 21-0 this
season. Smith currently ranks fourth
in the nation in the 50-yard freestyle
and fifth in the nation in the 100-
yard freestyle.

Smith led W&L with two wins on
Friday against Shepherd, finishing the

Outstanding performances
mark meet with Shepherd

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

The women’s swim meet against
Shepherd College last Friday resulted
in a victory for Washington and Lee
and some -extraordinary performances
for the women’s swimming team.

Junior Sharon Coleman took six
seconds off her time in the 200 back-
stroke while two of her tearrirnates,
sophomore Jodi Herring and freshman
Stephanie Sauers, turned in promising
times as well. Head coach Page
Remillard is very optimistic about the
upcoming contributions from Herring
and Sauers.

“Stephanie is returning to her
early season speed in the sprint
events. If she is swimming so impres-
sively now during our hardest training
period, then we expect her to just
take off after practices lighten up.
Jodi continues to eat up the distance
events and to make significant im-
provement each week," Rerriillard
said.

burg College came up short of a
victory for W&L, but the women met
their realistic expectations.

“We swam great against a great
team," said Remillard. “Gettysburg
is ranked in the nation's top ten, so
it will be a few years before we can
beat them.”

Freshman Claire Dudley pro-
vided one of the meet’s most positive
moments when she qualiﬁed for the
NCAA Division IH meet in the 200
breaststroke event. Rerriillard was
particularly impressed with this occur-
rence because the odds seemed
against it.

“Given the acaderriic and physical
pressure on Claire that week her
qualiﬁcation came as a big surprise.
She says that she just blocked it all
out and kept going hard,” said
Remillard.

W&L will swim against Radford
College next weekend and, according
to Rerriillard, the difference between
the teams will all come down to
training.

100-yard freestyle in 50.51 seconds
and the 200-yard freestyle in 1:49.91.

Also collecting first-place finishes
in Friday's meet, were sophomores
Doug Brown and Stuart Towns and
the 400-yard relay team.

Brown won the 1000-yard frees-
tyle with a time of 11:10.03 _while
Towns finished the 200-yard back-
stroke event in 2:08.22. The relay
team, composed of Smith, junior Jim
Dunleavy, sophomore Chip Nordhoff
and freshman Andrew Pearson,
ﬁnished with a time of 3:26.72, beat-
ing the Rams’ relay squad by just
under four seconds.

At Gettysburg on Saturday, the
Generals won eight races, but ended
up losing the meet by nine points.

“We’re winning a lot of events,”
Smith said. “But we don’t have the
depth to follow up on it and get the

Generals have fun on

road swim

seconds and thirds (and earn more
points)."

“Our depth hurt us and it will
continue to hurt us til we get more
guys,” Rernillard ridged. “The way
to solve that problem is through
recruiting and we’re working hard on
that right now."

With only an eight—man roster, the
Generals carmot afford to lose any-
one to an injury or the ﬂu. Yet,
Dunleavy has been battling the ﬂu
and he rriissed last week's practices.

“His performances were sig-
niﬁcantly off (last weekend),” said
Remillard.

Smith and Brown each swam to
two first-place finishes and the 400-
yard relay team set a new Gettysburg
pool record by finishing with a time
of 3:19.94.

Smith picked up victories in the
50-yard freestyle (22.23) and the 100-
yard freestyle (48.71). Brown reg-
istered a pair of victories for the
Generals by winning the 500-yard

and 100-yard freestyles (4:53.6l,
10:15.59).

Rounding out W&L’s individual
wins on Saturday were Nordlioff in
the 200-yard backstroke (2:06.95),
Towns in the 200-yard breaststroke
(2:25.23) and Dunleavy in the 200-
yard freestyle (1:48.19)

With only three meets remaining
to qualify for the national champion-
ships, Rernillard said that up to four
men have a realistic chance of post-
ing qualifying times. Smith has al-
ready qualiﬁed for nationals in the
50-yard and 100-yard freestyle events.

The next meet for the Generals

(now 6-5) is this Saturday at Rad-‘

ford.
“They're a young team. I suspect
our men should win,” Remillard said.

Dance classes offered in time for FD

By Pamela Kelley
Entertainment Editor

Looking for interesting ways to
impress your Fancy Dress date? For
$5 Dancing instructor Frank Roupas
will offer ballroom dancing lessons
that could turn you into a dancing
fool!

Roupas will teach students to
waltz, foxtrot, swing, and more. Stu-
dents may come with or without a
partner, so you can even surprise
your date.

Roupas, will hold three classes,
at 7:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m., and 9:00
p.m. in Room 113 of the University

Center on February 12th. In addition,
Roupas encourages the 7:00 p.n1. and
8:00 p.m. classes to attend the next
hour, free for practice. All students
need to do is show up.

Roupas, who has taught dance for
34 years, has become quite well
known in parts of Virginia, through
his dancing courses. He teaches at
various church and community func-
tions and travels to private homes
and some colleges like Roanoke
College and UVa. “I’m the only
dance teacher who makes house
calls,” he boasts.

Roupas has been making house
calls since the beginning of his ca-

W&L-owned pistol

 

By Blair Simmons
Staff Reporter

The United States Historical Soci-
ety is selling exact, full-size repro-
ductions of the ﬂintlock pistol set
owned by both George Washington
and Robert E. Lee.

Of the 1,000 set limited edition,
123 reservations had been made as of
two weeks ago, 37 of which are by
W&L alumni, said Brian Shaw, W&L
communications director.

W&L receives $50 for every set
sold with a minimum guarantee of
$25,000, paid in two installments,
said Shaw. The first installment of
$12,500 has already been received
and the second is expected this fiscal
year.

"If the entire edition sells out, we

could make $50,000," said Shaw.The
burl walnut and solid silver reproduc-
tions cost $2,200 a pair for W&L
alumni, $300 less than the issue
price. Called historic muzzle-loaders,
the working reproductions are free
from licensing requirements.

The original set of pistols is on
display in Lee Chapel and is esti-
mated to be worth over one million
dollars. Each .70 caliber ﬂintlock is
16 inches long with an almost
10-inch-long barrel.

They are believed to have been
made for General Washington in
London between 1766 and 1774 by
Mathias Barker. The highly detailed
hand—engraved ﬂoral patterns, lintel
borders and acorn pattern are typical
of quality silver work from the
mid-1700s.

Among the three surviving pair of

reer, and has been offering classes at
UVa for the last 13 years. Roupas
said he got the idea to offer ballroom
dancing classes at colleges when a
UVa student, who was interested in
classes, but too busy to travel to
Roanoke, had him come to Charlot-
tesville. He says he is now in heavy
demand for classes there.

When an interested W&L student
could not come to Roupas six years
ago, he traveled to Lexington as well.
Roupas thought that the classes would
not fare well at the, then all-male,
college. However, “It went over
big!” he says. He’s been returning
ever since, although he couldn't make

it back to teach last year.

Roupas has a very positive atti-
tude about the lessons, and says that
he has never had any failures at
dancing, because he works with indi-
viduals until they leam. His students
must, however practice at least ten
minutes a day, so they will not forget
their new skills.

The Dancemaster also offers a
piece of free advice: “Ballroom danc-
mg will keep you happy and
healthy.”

The classes are open to anyone.

Roupas and his course offerings, call

Washington's pistols, their history
traces the link between General
Washington and General Lee.

General Washington married Mar-
tha Dandridge Custis, a young widow
with two children. Later, when her
son died, the Washington's adopted
his two children.

General Washington gave the pair
of pistols to his adopted son, George
Washington Parke Custis, whose
daughter, Mary Anna Randolph Cus-
tis, married General Lee at Arlington
House in 1831. George Boling Lee,
the grandson of General Lee, gave
the pistols.to W&L.

The project began three years ago
when the Alumni Board approved the
United States Historical Society's
proposal to reproduce the pistol, said
Shaw.

They borrowed the pistols for a

“The question is: who works the
hardest in the middle of the season?
We chose to compete in 200-yard
events rather than 100-yard and have
received protestations from Radford.
Their opposition makes us want to
swim the 200 even more. We’re
banking on Radford being under-

' prepared since they wanted to go

with the short distance for some
reason,” said Remillard.

The team is keeping an eye on
the Atlantic Championships and the
last couple of weeks have included
intensely grueling training.

The reproductions have been
available to W&L alumni and Histori-

"We've gotten a very good re-

of the United States Historical Soci-

Washington and Lee’s 12th annual Mus-
cular Dystrophy Superdance raised over
$30,000 this weekend for “Jerry's Kids.”

Participating students solicited pledges and
danced at concerts Friday and Saturday night
at the student activities pavilion to raise
money for the Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion.

Lost in the Supermarket won Friday
night’s battle of the bands. Soul Kitchen
placed second. Those two bands led off
Saturday night’s program, followed by the

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Motown band Black and Blue and the head-
lining band Let’s Active.

Superdance Co—chairrnan Christie Charnp-
lin said the $30,000 goal for Superdance this
year was met even though contributions fell
just short of last year’s mark.

According to Charnplin, most of the
money has already been collected, but some
of it is in pledges. She said she hopes every-
one“ will follow through and contribute what
was promised.

“Friday night went really well — it was a
great time. Saturday, though, I think the
weather hurt us in terms of attendance, but it
was still fun,” Charnplin said.

Charnplin, along with Co-chairman Allen

Richardson, Vice—chairman Matt Wherry, and
Faculty Advisor Fontanne Bostic, led a com-
mittee of 40 that started planning the event
back in November.

given out because no single participant raised

Suttle won a trip to the Williarnsburg Hilton,
and the Law School's top contributor, Beth

Superdance 1990 earns $30,000 for ‘Jerry’s Kids’

This is the second year that the Super-
dance has used the two-night format. Pre-
viously, the dancers had been required to start
dancing on Saturday morning and continue,
with intermittent breaks, all day and into the
evening.

Champlin said she thinks the new format
has worked out very well.

“The hardest thing to work out is the
bands. We really have to start looking in
November, but no band wants to sign a
contract in November for a February concert
date,” she said.

She said there were no last minute sur-
prises and that the Superdance staff worked
very well together to get everything done.

Master Plan supported at public hearing

 

By Andrew Waters
Staff Reporter

‘ Washington and Lee’s Master Plan received
praise from most of the people who turned out
for last Thursday's public hearing, but a few
residents asked for assurance that the city's tax
base would not shrink.

Sixteen people gave short presentations
before the Lexington Planning Commission; 13
spoke in favor of the Master Plan while three
either opposed the proposal or questioned parts
of it.

Part the Master Plan proposes to expand the
city's institutional zoning district to include
fraternity houses the university plans to acquire
through the Fraternity Renaissance Program.
Some citizens were concerned that Lexington’s
tax base would shrink as a result because W&L
would not have ‘to pay taxes for the property.

Jack Page, a Virginia Military Institute
professor and Lexington resident, said he
wanted assurance that the university will pay
taxes. “I would like to see all property within
the city limits pay assessed rates as determined
by the city and have open appeals thereof."

W&L’s Coordinator for Capital Planning
Frank Parsons said the university would give
donations to the city in lieu of taxes. The
donation would be an “escalating thing,” he
said.

“As assessments go up, donations go up. The
city is losing nothing from this," he said.

W&L and VMI currently give the city
donations in lieu of taxes on a voluntary basis.

Because W&L, VMI and churches are
exempt from paying city taxes, more than 50
percent of the land in Lexington is tax free —
- a greater proportion of tax free land than in
another city in Virginia. Consequently,
Lexington residents pay more taxes than any

other citizens in Virginia, said Mary Gentry,
chairwoman of the Planning Commission.

“The Planning Commission is aware that 10
years from now the same people will not be on
the [W&L] Board of Trustees nor on the Plan-
ning Commission," Gentry said, “so something
must be put into writing’ to. insure adequate
donations in the future.

Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins, associate dean

of students, told the commission that the
Fraternity Renaissance Program represents a
potential for increased income to the city.
Fourteen new jobs will be created, he said,
because each fraternity will have to hire a
resident manager.
‘ Former Plarming Commission chairman
Henry Ravenhorst said the city should go ahead
and approve the expansion of the institutional
district according to the outline in W&Ls
Master Plan.

Ravenhorst, who was on the planning

cornmission-when the institutional district was
established in 1985, said fraternities were not
originally included as part of the district be-
cause the university did not own them at that
time.

“It would seem to me that fraternities being
an adjunct of the university that they could be
included as a permitted use as opposed to a
conditimal use,” Ravenhorst said.

If the city agrees to include fraternities in
the institutional district, the university can have
changes approved on a system-wide basis rather
than go through the process of applying for a
conditional use permit for each house.

Members of the Planning Commission
expressed concerns earlier, however, that the
city would relinquish the ability to review
proposed changes in the future if it allowed the
expansion.

Undergraduate tuition will be
raised from $10,100 to $10,850 for
the 1990-91 academic year, an-
nounced Washington and Lee Presi-
dent John D. Wilson.

The Board of Trustees decided to
increase the average cost of room,
board and tuition by 7.3% to keep up
with inﬂation in the cost of books
and periodicals, computer software
and faculty and administration travel,
said Wilson. «

The average cost will jump from
an average of $13,602 to an average
of $14,595. “I was hoping to keep it
under 7% but I couldn't, doing all
the other things we wanted to do,”
Wilson said.

W&L costs less to attend than

sooner than expected.

According to the Sept. 7 issue of
The Ring-tum Phi, Atkins placed Phi
Delt on probation on Aug. 22 for
failing to comply with the univer-
sity’s Standards for Fraternities at
Washington and Lee.

According to University Proctor
Charles Murray, damage to the Phi
Delt house last spring term included
broken ceiling fans, removed or par-
tially removed light fixtures, kicked-in
doors and broken windows on the
second and third ﬂoors. Beer cans
and other trash were also left over
the summer, Murray said.

In a letter sent to Holland, Atkins

comparable private schools in the
Southeast, said Wilson, with the ex-
ception of Hampden-Sydney. The
next lowest tuition rate is $10,867, at
Davidson College.

The most expensive school in the
area is Georgetown University, cost-
ing $13,250 for the 1989-90 academic
year.

W&L Law School tuition will go
up from $10,300 to $11,200, staying
below tuitions at comparable private
schools in the region, said Wilson.

Executive Committee President
Willard Dumas said he told the
Board that law school students may
be presenting a petition requesting a
referendum to determine whether or
not there should be separate honor
systems for the law and the under-
graduate schools.

“If members of the law school
request a referendum, we would do

said the house was left “just general-
ly trashed” at the end of the spring
term. Atkins said it was the second
consecutive year the fraternity was
found in “unacceptable” condition
and in violation of the Standards.
The letter placed several restric-
tions on the chapter to be completed
by the beginning of the coming spr-
ing term. These included limiting the
number of pledges to 15, prohibiting
weeknight parties, and limiting other
parties to four per month with only
two occurring at the Phi Delt house.
According to Atkins, the house
was also required to raise its Grade
Point Average one place per term in

the rankings of fraternities.

In addition, Atkins said, the frater-

nity was required to “develop and
implement an ongoing service project
to beneﬁt the community, the college
or the Greek system.”
, “The chapter must improve its
relationship and cooperation with
other Greek organizations on campus
and substantially improve its reputa-
tion,” he said.

Other restrictions, which were to
have been completed by Oct. 1,
required that the -house take appro-
priate intemal disciplinary measures,
assist the House Corporation in com-
pleting the necessary repairs, and

tuition increase

that,” said Dumas after speaking with
the Board. “However, the Board
reminded me that they have ﬁnal
authority on all matters of the Honor
System.”

The Board of Trustees approved
the creation of a new position in the
Journalism and Economics Depart-
ments, two new positions at the law
school and the accommodation of
Dean Lewis John's move to the Poli-
tics Department in an effort to en-
rich the student-faculty ratio, Wilson
said.

The Board also decided to hire a
staff member for the Computer Cen-
ter in Tucker Hall, a manager for the
Lenfest Center and Building and
Grounds help for the Lenfest Center
and the Fraternity Renovation pro-
jects.

Thirteen million dollars worth of
bonds have been sent to the bond

market to raise capital, said Wilson.
The Board plans to use that money to
upgrade the Prime computer system
and to go forward this summer with
the Fraternity Renaissance program.

Work on the addition to Lewis
Hall, to accommodate the papers of
Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell,
is scheduled to begin as soon after
Commencement as possible, in hopes
that it will closed up by September,
said Wilson.

The Board also approved progress
on the Lenfest Center but moved the
projected completion date to the end
of September, said Wilson.

The Board is planning a special
meeting on April 5-6 to discuss long-
range plans and goals, such as a,
science building annex, a student
center and improved athletic facilities
for men and women under the stands
at Wilson ﬁeld, Wilson said.

the damage to the house.

Holland said representatives of his
fraternity first met with Atkins on
Sept. 6 in a failed attempt to get
Atkins to rescind some parts of the
probation. Holland ofﬁcially applied
for the termination of the probation-
ary status in a Jan. 30 letter to the
IFC Judicial Board.

In the letter, Holland said Phi Delt
had “fulﬁlled all of the objectives
and stipulations of the probation.”

W&L buys
old house

from ZBT

By Chuck Broll
Staff Reporter

Goodloe Lewis defeated Les
Lewis for the position of 1990-91
lnterfratemity Council president and
Associate Dean of Students Leroy C.
“Buddy” Atkins said the university
and Zeta Beta Tau have agreed on a
price for the purchase of the ZBT
house, at Tuesday night’s IFC meet-
ing.

Lewis will serve as president
beginning spring term, along with
Vice President-elect Mike Skarda,
Secretary-elect Jonathan Symonds,
Treasurer-elect Foster Bowman, Se-
nior Justice-elect Eric Mutz and Ju-
nior Justices-elect Rob Rambo and
Greg Hicks.

Atkins gave no speciﬁc price
regarding the purchase of the ZBT
house because the agreement is only
a verbal one and contracts have not
yet been signed, he said.

Atkins did say, however, that the
ﬁnal price was more than the univer-
sity wanted to pay, but less than ZBT
national originally asked.

The house will probably be the
future home of Kappa Sigma, but it
may also be used to house various
fraternity students during the Fratemi~
ty Renaissance, Atkins said.

Attending their first meeting as members of W&L’s Board of Trustees
last weekend were Thomas Broadus Jr., Stephen Marks Ill and Arthur
A. Birney. W&L photo by W. Patrick Hinely.

 

 
 

OPINION

 

‘Only one rule’

Friday in the Moot Court Room of Washington and
Lec’s Law School, first-year law student Mitch Neurock
laid out what he and several law students are calling
“Proposition L.” These proposed amendments to the
White Book would allow the Law School to set up its
own honor council and to conduct its own open hearings.

While Neurock’s‘ ideas have some merit, we cannot
support them. As two law students pointed out on this
page last week, the Honor System is an important bridge
between the Law School and the undergraduate program.
But it is not simply a means to unity. The Honor System
is perhaps the most integral part of this university; it
should be the greatest lesson we take from this place.

Neurock’s proposal does not take this into account. For
example, he suggests that, because expulsion could cost a
law student his career, only law students should judge law
students. He implies that a law-only jury would be less
likely to convict one of their colleagues than a jury that
includes undergraduates, because law students understand
what’s at stake. Neurock wants us to ask, “Is the
punishment appropriate to the crime?”

The willingness of any student to ask such a question
reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the Honor
System. Because our community is based on a premise of
trust, violation of that trust necessarily means the offender
must leave W&L. Whether an act “merits” expulsion is
irrelevant. That is why the EC and juries are asked only
to determine guilt; once guilt is found, the case is
decided. To understand the White Book is to understand
that expulsion is the only possible response to an honor
violation, because a violator of our trust cannot possibly
remain a member of our community.

Also, Neurock claims undergraduates must ask too
many questions to understand how the Law School works;
he says curricular differences make undergraduates poor
judges of honor in the Law School. The implication is
that the definition of what is honorable varies according to
where one is in relation to Woods Creek. This treats
honor as a set of calibrations rather than a concept, as a
technical standard rather than a shared ideal.

The Honor System is very simple. If a student does not
violate our trust, he is trusted. That trust crosses all lines
of color, age, sex _— and school.

To divide the Honor System is to divide that trust, to
compartmentalize honor. That undergraduates and law
students do not meet often is unfortunate, but it reﬂects
the natural inclination for people to seek as friends those
with whom they have much in common. All W&L stu-
dents are nevertheless bound by a commitment to honor.
To separate the means of enforcement necessarily would
endanger that concept and jeopardize essential aspects of
the Honor System, such as the single sanction, the ab-
sence of rigid deﬁnition and the contributions students
make to the Honor System campus-wide. «  ,

There are other reasons to oppose Neurock’s plan.
Under his proposals, the diminished candidate and jury

pools would make holding impartial hearings all but im-

possible. Also, law students would still help elect the
undergraduate schools’ chief Honor System custodians,
because of the EC’s governmental duties, but those offi-
cers would have honor authority over undergraduates only.
This distinction would discourage law students from run-
ning for Big Three offices and would further deprive
undergraduates of contact with law students, and law
students of contact with undergraduates.

We can all benefit from the Honor System by studying
it and making its ideals our own, and the system can
benefit from us if we work to preserve and improve what
has been given to us. Indeed, that mutual nurturing may
be W&L’s greatest mission and its greatest asset. For
those reasons, we applaud Neurock’s efforts. But his ideas
would undermine the system, not improve it. The response
to his suggestions must be a resounding no.

OUR VIEW 

EDITOR'S NOTE: This ‘Our View’ was submitted by SAB Chairman Charles
Conklin, Vice Chairman Stewart Hammond, Entertainment Director Michael

Applebaum, Fancy Dress Chairman Alex Hitz, Fancy Dress Auditor John‘

Hamilton, and Publicity Director Schuyler Rideout.

It has come to our attention that one of the candidates for president of the
Executive Committee, Willard Dumas, intends to take autonomous credit for
the Student Activities Board’s ten thousand dollar surplus from the fall.

Subsequently, Dumas plans to use the fact that the SAB has succeeded in
providing a variety of excellent entertainment without signiﬁcant loss as a
premise for his campaign. Actually, this premise warrants clariﬁcation.

Although the EC as a whole did implement effective and sensible structural
guidelines for the SAB earlier this year, it is indeed the SAB, itself, that is
responsible for -the success of carnpus-wide entertainment at a minimum net
cost.

This is not something that has been easily achieved; it .has required
painstaking organization, communication, research, and teamwork on the part
of the SAB.

As an example, the first event this year, a concert by the Truly Dangerous
Swamp Band, sponsored by the SAB, earned a net income in excess of eight
times the combined revenue of all SAB-sponsored events from last year.

Certainly a member of the EC who does not sit on the SAB or even attend
the majority of SAB sponsored events can not be considered responsible for
the success of the SAB this year.

Through careful planning, the SAB planned to provide eight events at a net
cost of $13,000. However, because of the SAB’s hard work, the net cost of
all these events was only $3,000.

While we appreciate the EC’s preliminary efforts, it is the SAB that
executed and expanded the new policies. We and not the EC were responsible
for the major and minor decisions that saved the $10,000 of the projected
budget. And we believe that if anyone has the right, or feels the need to take
credit for this action, it should be the SAB, and not a candidate for the
president of the EC.

. 54.,

EDITOR'S NOTE: This ‘Our View’ was submitted by SAB Treasurer Katie’
Duwel, SAB Law School Publicity Chairman Martika Parson and Operatiom
Director Ann Gregory. - ‘ i .,

The changes that spurred the current success of the Student‘Activities Board’
can be largely attributed to the Executive Committee and its leadership by.
President Willard Dumas. Last year's board mismanaged its allocation, and al
$20,000 deficit fell on this year’s EC. Change was a necessity. I

The EC insisted in the fall of 1989 that the SAB improve both structure
and organization to prevent further financial disaster. Vice President Jon,‘
Sheinberg “beseeched” SAB chairman Charles Conklin to take charge and
straighten out the SAB. President Dumas insisted that votes be taken, minutes‘
be kept and meetings be held at regular times and in the EC Room. These,
demands were met, as were many others, by the entire SAB. Each member
stopped using charge accounts and became accountable for the responsibili-‘V’
ties of his office. The changes were time-consurning but well worth it. yl

Each student pays a yearly activity fee with his tuition, and a large portion
of that fee is allocated by the EC to the SAB. The money assigned to the
SAB is to be used solely for entertaining the student body. The SAB is.
accountable to the EC and, ultimately, to every student. Many financial
updates are given to the EC and to students through The Ring-tum Phi. w .

Because our fall budget was extremely conservative and the books were,
watched carefully, the SAB has $10,000 more this term than we'd planned on."
This money, too, will be spent wisely and diversely to entertain as many;
interests as possible. For this, much thanks is owed to both the EC and the
SAB for wise judgement and planning. .

Although the SAB is a subcommittee of the EC, its purpose is not political,
We praise those leaders who have committed themselves to protecting the
rights and interests of the student body. The actions of the EC this year have
forced the SAB to reevaluate ineffective policies. These changes were effected
through the hard work and leadership demonstrated by the EC. This is a year
of transition for the SAB. Through the guidance of leaders like Dumas, and
our willingness to cooperate with the EC, success is inevitable for the SAB. ’

Law alumnus
apologizes for
meal mayhem

Ryan M. Kull’s letter to the editor concerning
this year’s Gentlernen’s “Buffet” (this year, the
meal was served) is unfair, but not unprovoked.
I have attended the “ Buffet” since its inception
four years ago. This year is the first time that I
have seen any of the guests misbehave.

The “Buffet” was founded by some class-
mates of mine for the purpose of celebrating the
South. Even this year, the majority of the guests
discussed history (military and other-wise),
constitutional law (particularly the erosion of
states’ rights), and southern culture. The embar-
rassing episode in which certain guests harassed
the waiters was not representative of the eve-
ning’s events.

The song to which Mr. Kull referred, “Lin-
coln killed the Constitution,” written by Mark-
ham S. Pyle (W&L '84, ’88L), more accurately
reﬂects the thinking of the original guests of the
“Buffet" in its third verse:

The sovereignty of states is something that is
now all gone...The Tenth amendment fades away
like stars before the dawn...The federal undertak-
ers tore up Arlington's fair lawn...’Cause the
Constitution’s dead..Help me dig up old John
Randolph”!-Ielp me dig up old John Randolph...
Help me dig up old John Randolph... And hide
away his bones.

LETTERS

The recent events in Eastern Europe have
vindicated the concepts of local autonomy and
states’ rights, and these are what the “Buffet”
celebrates.

Four years ago, when the “Buffet” began,
about half as many gentlemen attended. The
invitations were not as selectively extended this
year as a number of the guests were not gentle-
men. In fact, after this year's “Buffet," a num-
ber of the old timers retired to more tranquil
settings and discussed (1) how rude some of the
guests had been this year and (2) how the guest
list should be prepared with more discrimination
so as to include only gentlemen.

What was originally an evening of comradery,
history, and culture, degenerated into an evening
(albeit isolated) of drinking by some guests.
General Lee would have disapproved I join Mr.
Kull in hoping that it will not be repeated next
year.

Reader says
Phi should
censor letters

I am writing to you regarding the colurrm
“Two Law Students Defend the Unified Honor
System" that appeared last week. Having taken
issue already with the authors, I now turn to
address your publication of the letters.

Given that the editors and writers of The

Ring-tum Phi represent the next generation of the
guardians of American media, you owe it to your
readers to uphold the honored privilege of Free
Speech. However, given also an audience of
well-educated and generally open-minded
students, are you required to print, without
discrimination, every letter submitted regardless
of content?

On closer examination, those columns you
printed last week appear less concerned . with
presenting a counter-argument for your readers to
consider than with bashing a student having the
brazen audacity to criticize the status quo. What
place do the free use of inﬂammatory expressions
as ‘yellow journalism,’ and ‘fear tactics’ have in
your paper? Is everyone free to make personal
attacks in your editorial columns, such as accus-
ing another student of being ‘pompous,’ ‘arro-
gant,’ or ‘ludicrous?’ Does The Ring-tum Phi
have the journalistic duty to print such thinly-
veiled disparagements?

While the objective arguments presented by
the authors may have been worthy of being aired,
the manner in which they presented those argu-
ments was hardly as meritorious. Is it enough,
then, having printed this written assault, to stand
behind the disclaimer, “The views expressed
herein are not necessarily...?”

Instead of polling the results of the Bud
Bowl, why not find out whether your readers
want a paper steeped in the standard of journal-
ism being set by daytime talk show sensational-
ists, or an accurate, objective reporting of what
the issues are in the W&L community? Put me
down for the latter, please. I already get the
Enquirer at Harris-Teeter.

' THE SBAR SIDE

By Jon Sbar

In an effort to satisfy my fe-

, male editor's ardent desire for a

fulﬁlling journalistic encounter, I

'3 will endeavor to penetrate the
5 vrrgrnal landscape of current affairs

by thrusting my virile writing

i utensil into yet another topical

story.
In this article I have decided to

i ’ 4 address those perplexing mysteries

of human existence that have frus-
trated philosophers since the old

¢ days when mankind was still ﬂoat-

ing around in that post-big bang,
evolutionary bowl of clam chow-

’ ; der, and journalists were allowed

. ._,A.,--4:-. .

.
. 
l

to tell careless readers to go back
and slowly re-read the ﬁrst sen-
tence of their articles.

The first perplexing mystery in-
t volves movie theaters, where peo-
ple have historically gone to avoid
talking to ﬁrst dates or family
members. For some strange reason,
a subversive and highly annoying
group of people persist in clapping
at the end of emotional movies
H: such as E.T., in which an ugly,

extra-terrestrial creature is inte-
grated into American society after
proving he can use a telephone
and ride a ﬂying bicycle. Do these
movie clappers believe that the
cast and producers of E.T. are
,5 sitting near them in the theater and
' deserve to be rewarded? Perhaps
the clappers are all addicted to an
expensive psychedelic drug that is
dispensed freely to anyone with
the nerve to clap at the end of a
movie. Maybe the clappers have
been told by Ann Landers or
Oprah Winfrey that daily clapping
will bring them wealth, love and a
new wardrobe. Maybe the movie
clappers also clap when they hear
a good song on the radio. Maybe
we should move on to another per-
‘i plexing mystery. (Readers who

Sbar penetrates
world mysteries

think this is a good idea should
now applaud).

Perplexing mystery #2: Why
is every motel room in the solar
system, even those that have vi-
brating beds, fumished with at
least one Bible?

Answer: Back before they in-
vented churches, pious families
woke up early Sunday, put on
their best clothes, checked into a
motel room and without hesita-
tion, turned on the vibrating beds.
Of course, I'm only joking. Motels
provide Bibles so patrons have
drug-free alternatives to staying up
late and watching porn ﬂicks.

Perplexlng mystery #3: How
come the corporate world has been
allowed to take over college foot-
ball to such an extent that the
Orange Bowl is now referred to as
the “Beatrice-Mutual of Omaha-
Toyota-Drink Florida Orange
(Juice) Bowl?”

Answer: I have no idea but
let's just thank God that journalism
is free from any type of corporate
inﬂuence (eat Cap’n Crunch Cereal
and ﬂy Delta Airlines).

Perplexlng mystery #4: What
happens to all the gum that people

constantly spit out onto the
ground?
Answer: According to the

person who answers the phone at
the Bazooka Joe Gum factory, all
the old gum pieces bonded togeth-
er (literally), teamed up with an
indigenous rock faction and lob-
bied to gain control of a layer of
the earth's crust.

Perplexlng mystery #5: What
influenced me to write an article
that proves beyond a shadow of a
doubt that I deserve to be locked
up in a building with people who
express themselves by drooling?

Answer: Actually, I had plan-
ned to write an award-winning
editorial on developments in East-
ern Europe when it occurred to me
that I keep up with current events
by reading novels and, consequent-
ly, know nothing about the subject.

Honor by an EC alumnus

MY VIEW
By Christopher

deMovellan
I enjoyed reading D. Ross Pat-
terson's thought-provoking article

titled, “R.E. Lee’s ‘Honor’ vs. the
Honor System.” It is a treat to see
students concerned about the current
and future status of the Honor Sys-
tern.

I do not intend to rebut Mr. Pat-
terson because I generally agree with
his point of view. I would like to
clarify and/or editorialize on some of
the comments made, based on my
experience with the Executive Com-
mittee.

We must first deﬁne two words
which are often used interchange-
ably: honorable and honest. Webster’s
Dictionary defines honorable as “at-
testing to creditable conduct — char-
acterized by integrity; guided by a
high sense of honor and duty.” Web-
ster’s deﬁnes honest, “free from
fraud or deception.” In layman’s

terms, honorable is someone who is
morally and ethically upstanding and
treats others with respect. Honest is
someone who does not lie, cheat,
steal or do any other associable act
that falls between the cracks of these
general examples.

It quickly becomes apparent that
one can be honest without being
honorable, but one cannot be honor-
able without being honest. If we can
agree on these terms I will continue.

It was said last year that we
should change the Honor System to
“Do not lie, cheat, or steal in Rock-
bridge County.” I respect the individ-
ual for his/her clarity (but not so
much for his/her character). The
White Book states that the Honor
System is “according to the current
student body generation.” That means
it is up to each individual to shape
the Honor System.

It would appear that the current
system governs that which is (dis)ho-
nest rather than that which is (dis)ho-
norable. I hasten to add that this is
not written in stone...it is not written
anywhere for a very good reason.

When the “current student body
generation” decides that the Honor
System should include acts that are
(dis)honorable (beyond dishonest),
then the acquaintance rapists, drug
offenders, vandals, and those who
continue to insist on hazing will be
dismissed under the Honor System.
The Executive Committee has the
ability to do these things today. They
probably will not unless you, the
student body, emphasize the fact that
students, not the EC, control and
support the strength and standards of
the Honor System.

Ross commented on the support
of the faculty and administration. I
wish to explain that in my experi-
ence, the faculty and the admirristra—
tion have been 100 percent behind
the Honor System. The members of
the faculty beneﬁt from the system of
mutual trust as well: when a student
says she/he was sick, the student can
be trusted. There are exceptions, but
they are few. President Wilson has
assured me that every member of our
community is expected to act within
these standards, and even faculty

members are held accountable.

It is important to note, however,
that there is a delicate balance be-
tween the pursuit of an ideal and the
existence of reality. The fact that we
actively support one of the strongest
honor systems in the country does
not eliminate the reality that people
lie, cheat, and steal. The faculty and
students must balance between the
naive and the cynical. Therefore, a
gentle reminder that all work is
pledged is healthy and may deter
temptation. An occasional request for
a note from the inﬁrmary does the
same thing. If you are telling the
truth, be mature enough not to take it
personally; the next time you won’t
need a note.

The Honor System is very impor-
tant to all of us. Its strength makes
Washington and Lee unique. I thank
D. Ross Patterson for his article
because the Honor System grows
with every tough question and every
critical analysis.

P.S. It is true that you take the
Honor System with you to you post-
graduate endeavors.

Honor versus the Honor System

MY VIEW
By Todd Peppers

I am writing in response to D. Ross Patterson’s
commendable article concerning the disturbing
trend in the definition of honor at Washington and
Lee. I essentially agreed with most of the points
Mr. Patterson raised. The question I want to pose
is: are there any students in the Washington and
Lee community who agree with him? Do you think
that honor goes beyond lying, cheating, and
stealing? I_f a W&L student is found guilty of
leaving the scene of a fatal accident, then do you
consider that action dishonorable?

Please remember that the Executive Committee
is run by the students of W&L. We select who
will sit on the EC, and we — the “student
generation” — decide how to deﬁne honor. I have
difﬁculty interpreting the mood of our student
generation. Are there W&L students who agree that
honorable actions exclude harmful actions toward
others? If there are students who think it is time to
change the deﬁnition of honor, then I urge you to
act on those feelings.

I have talked with a few students about my
worries concerning the Honor System Some agree
with me, in principle, that actions such as date
rape or the selling of hard narcotics do constitute
dishonorable behavior. But these students add that
the Honor System at W&L couldn’t handle an
expanded deﬁnition of honor. One professor
informed me that the Honor System gives us
“three-fourths of a loaf of bread. What you want
is to expand the definition of honor and try to get
the whole loaf of bread. It just isn't possible,” he
said. “The Honor System would be fatally
weakened.”

I am not satisﬁed with this conclusion.

In a Phi article last September, I raised a
fundamental question but failed to get a response.
I will ask my question one more time — what do
you consider to be the more dishonorable act: the
shoplifting of food, lying to a fellow student or
date rape? All three acts do occur on this campus.
But during my tenure at W&L, and to the best of
my knowledge, only the ﬁrst two acts have gone
to honor trial. How can we permanently expel
students from school for cheating — forever
changing the course of their lives -— while not
bringing students before the EC for actions we

deem equally reprehensible?

As W&L students, we claim to live by Lee’s
one rule that “every student must be a
gentleman." And I agree with Mr. Patterson that
the privilege of being a W&L student “must cause
[us] to conform to a higher standard of behavior.”
But that doesn’t always happen at General Lee’s
college. Honor must go beyond unproctored exarrrs
during finals week and unattended watches on
library carrels.

I came to W&L a passionate supporter of the
single-sanction Honor System. I thought honor was
not a question of degree, and that the only
punishment for a violation should be permanent
expulsion. Now I am not so staunch in my
convictions. I hear W&L students remark that they
regard certain actions utterly devoid of honor, but
that the system would be unduly burdened if the
EC tried those cases. What they are saying, in
essence, is that date rape and cheating are both
dishonorable, but one is much easier to prove —
therefore honor will be defined by the ability to
prosecute a case. This is wrong.

I ardently support the single-sanction Honor
System if it applies to all actions that are

 :MY VIEW

jg, By J. Cameron Humphries

Among the many activities in which I par-
ticipated in my senior year in high school
. were the visits to perspective colleges and
' universities. Perhaps my most memorable
" visit, the visit to Washington and Lee aside,
was a trip to small, northeastern liberal arts
school. My parents warned me against the
northeast universities — my mother said,
r “they just don’t think properly up there."
.‘Perhaps this admonition sparked my interest
- even more, and I proceeded to visit one of
‘these small schools.
Unlike Washington and Lee, this universi-
l ty chose only to promote one of their depart-
Qments, most appropriately labeled “Anti-
’ Math.” To the best of my knowledge, this
.1 was the only university in the world that

offered such a program. Basically, this
program allowed its students to explore and
exploit the fallacies and hidden contradictions
of mathematics. A small brochure in the
admissions ofﬁce stated, “We are conﬁdent
that our Anti-Math program will be the
cornerstone of 2lst-century thought.” Im-
pressed by their originality, I asked to visit
the head of this department.

His classroom was surprisingly modest,
although it markedly contained no structure.
The walls were of uneven height and the
ceiling looked as though it were about to
collapse. Posters of atomic mushroom clouds,
nuclear missiles, collapsed architectural struc-
tures, and cartoons of robots controlling
mankind covered the walls. A subtle feeling
of repulsion filled me as I looked upon the
professor who designed this course. Then he
looked up to see me.

“Welcome, you must be the perspective.”

“Yes sir, it is a pleasure to meet you.”

“Yes, this is the Anti-Math room. This

room is a temple to the foolishness of man’s
unquestioning acceptance of mathematics. For
example, did you know that when Euclid
developed mathematics — yes that’s another
important point, math has not always existed,
man merely invented it to explain some
matters of the universe, but that’s another
subject - he tried to begin by deﬁning all his
principles at ﬁrst, then using those he would
deduce all other theorems. Well, he couldn’t
do it.”

The professor became flushed at this
point. “No, he had to insert another principle
to prove that parallel lines do not converge.
Geometry just falls apart because of that. Of
course you know that Frenchman had to come
along in the 18th century to try to tidy that
oversight up, but by then it was too late. And
what about divisibility by zero? Mathematics
just cannot handle it. We just as well take the
whole system on faith. How do we know that
two plus two equals four? How do we even
know that we are talking about the same two,

the same four? It’s all relative; there are no
absolutes. That's the kind of subject matter
we cover with our intro to Anti-Math class.
You’ll study the contradictions and the conse-
quences of math.

“Look at that,” he said, pointing to the
poster of the mushroom cloud. “You’re a
smart boy, you know what horrors nuclear
weapons cause. If it weren’t for math, there
would be no such horrors. That’s right, no
weapons, no wars, no borders, nothing. It is
mathematics which divides and separates man.
Well, that’s enough for an introduction to our
program. I look forward to seeing you next
fall.” ‘

On the trip home I realized how simply
foolish the thought of Anti-Math was. In the
vain pursuit of living in a world without
math, he only further asserted its absolute
existence. Merely because he chose not to
acknowledge measurement in the design of
his classroom in no way altered the fact that
the only thing the professor had failed to use

was a ruler. In an odd sense the premise of
Anti-Math required that its followers ﬁrst
acknowledge that math exists, so that they
could “step outside" the rules of math to
disprove them. Yet as I returned to high
school, and then to college, I noticed a no-
less-absurd Anti-Trutlr, Anti-Church and
Anti—God program that permeated every
college and university in the world. For some
reason “intellectual man” has found it per-
fectly acceptable to apply the same fallacious
arguments that the professor used in his
Anti-Math thesis to “soundly” ridicule the
notion that Truth exists, organized religion is
valid, or that there is a God. Instead of
attacking what the Truth states, we attack
what man has done and attempted to justify
in the name of the Truth. We live in a world
that lives and teaches the professor's final
argument, “there are no absolutes.” Yet this
very premise assumes the existence of at least
one absolute. We laugh at the thought of
Anti-Math and his arguments, but why?

Junior, Bovl/ling Green, Ky.

Listed below are a few of the
reasons that effected my decision
to run for President of the Execu-

I would like to see the Execu-

role in promoting student aware-
ness in controversial areas such as
the CRC.

Secondly, I disagree with the
practice of appointing members of
the student body for positions for
which they did not apply. Specif-

ically, last semester the EC re-

We have made your student-appointed leaders accountable for your

take action which resulted in a raise of the Student Activities Fee.

represent the broadest possible spectrum of interest among the student
body, when I carry out my duties and responsibilities.

ceived resignations from the Fancy Dress Chairman, Vice Chairman and
Auditor, all of whom applied for different positions than they received.
Finally, I believe I can lessen the possibility of an adversarial relation-
ship between members of the student body and the Executive Committee.
By recognizing only violations of the student body’s trust as honor viola-
tions, fears of an overzealous Executive Committee will be put to rest.

Robert Sau nook

When Robert E. Lee estab-
lished the Honor Code, he created
with it_the understanding that the
students of Washington & Lee
would work together to create a
society of honor and trust. With
that goal in mind, the Executive
Committee was formed to unite
the student effort and ensure that
President Lee's desire was main-
tained. The Executive Committee
was not formed to work against
the students or function apart

bring the students together in a team effort
Lee's vision of a society of honor and trust.

Junior, Harrisonburg, Pa.

The Washington and Lee
Honor System is the best of its
kind. It can be better. We need
to return to a community of trust.
That means trials only when cases
are clear cut and with intent.
That means an Honor System that
works for you, with an EC that
backs you up if your honor is
questioned. That means a budget"

not someone else’s sense of right

You deserve an effective EC.

VICE PRESIDENT
Mark Cobb

Second-Year Law, DeFuniak Springs, Fl.

Having served two years on
the Executive Committee, I am
fully aware of the responsibilities
of the vice-president and believe
I am the most qualiﬁed candidate.

In addition to the standard EC
duties, the vice president super-
vises the allocation of the student
body funds; he also advises the
accused during honor proceedings.

During my two temts, I have
helped distribute over $300,000.
The addition of the money from
the increased activitv fee calls for

an experienced leader. '

As advisor to the accused, the vicepresident plays a vital role in
maintaining the integrity of the honor system. With my experience, I
will fairly administer the goals of the system with the rights of the
accused.

The EC represents the voice of the students; I wish to grant more stu-
dents a greater responsibility.

I support positive change, and encourage everyone to vote. Hopefully,
that vote will be for Mark Cobb.

John Fialcowitz

Junior, Garden City, N.Y.

The Vice President shoulders
two distinct roles. He or she
serves as the Student Body’s
financial administrator. Having
represented my class for two
years on the Executive Commit-
tee, I have cooperated with past
Vice‘-Presidents in constructing
equitable budgets that reﬂect
student needs and concerns. I
have stood for conservative allo-
cations and structural improve-
ments in the Student Activities
Board during this lean fiscal year. .
As Chairman and Co—Founder of Live Drive, I worked with other
students to create the program in 1988. Since then, Live Drive has
developed into an organization consisting of 108 members and has car-
ried over 3,000 passengers. The Vice President also serves as Techni-
cal Adviser to the accused during honor proceedings. Again, through my
two years experience I have developed a detailed working knowledge of
the White Book and its procedural guidelines.

Rays Welder

Junior, Beeville, Tex.

I'm Ray Welder, candidate for
Vice President of the Executive
Committee. I must confess that
this is the first time I have ever
been interested in an EC position.
The reason I am running is that
too often, it seems, the Executive
Committee is too far removed
from the students. I’ share the
concerns of the undergraduate and
law students that the current EC
may not reﬂect the fundamental
sentiments of the student body.

A spirit of trust should per- ,
va'de the workings of the EC and its dealings with students. Student.
representatives are students just like everyone else — not quasi-administra-
tors. The Executive Committee should be receptive to the needs of the
student body as a whole. If elected, I will strive to make the EC as
open and accountable as possible. If you believe as I do, that it's time
for a change, then vote Ray Welder for Vice President.

I have lived and worked under
the Honor System during the last
four years as a W&L undergradu-
ate, and I appreciate the prestige
and the privileges which that
system brings to our comrnu.nity.
Ours is truly a unique experience,
even among schools with honor
systems. In order to retain this
unique lifestyle, I believe we need
strong leaders on the EC who
will protect the Honor System,
but who will listen to construc-
tive criticism and tr'y to improve . ‘ r
the overall effectiveness of the EC. I have proven my leadership abilities
over the last four years as a member of Omicron Delta Kappa, president I »
of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, vice-president of the Inter-Fraternity Council and
president of Kathekon. Also, I think I cart be a uniting factor betweax 5
the law students and the undergraduates because I understand the
correct of both sides.

Having served on the Execu-

the commitment. I care about
W&L, its values and its people.
This intense love of W&L is
what has made my job so reward-

the compassion and empathy I
feel for other students, I trust my
judgment and integrity to see that
trust and honor are upheld.
I'm asking you to elect me not only because I believe in W&L, but
because I am qualified. I've had the beneﬁt of on-hand experience, and

Fourteen women have established
a Delta Gamma Interest Group in
order to proceed with the addition of
Delta Gamma Women's Fraternity at
Washington and Lee University.

The interest group, which held its
first meeting Monday night, has peti-
tioned Panhellenic for an observation
seat on the council. However, Pan-
hellenic Council carmot officially
accept the Delta Gamma Interest
Group [DGIG] until it receives a
petition including each mernber’s

name. The Council also needs the
approval of Delta Garrirna’s National
Council.

The interest group has been in
touch with some of DG’s national
representatives and is receiving help
from local alumnae. Elizabeth Besen-
felder, DGIG's national contact repre-
sentative, has been in touch with a
colonization representative as well as
DG’s national expansion director.

The purpose stated by the interest
group is “to have enough women
interested in Delta Gamma to
colonize in the fall, to invite inter—
ested women to learn about DG and
the Greek system and to get more

dishonorable. And I signed a card
during my freshman year that pledged
my intentions to live in our
community of honor. But when I see
students permanently expelled from
this school for shoplifting while other
students are not brought before the
EC for dishonorable conduct (are
there any who will not define date-
rape as dishonorable?), my faith in
the single-sanction begins to waver.
I call on the EC to address the
questions that Mr. Patterson raised.
The EC has the “primary
responsibility for enforcing” the

Honor System, yet the EC cannot try
cases unless students approach EC
members with potential honor
violations. Nor can the EC alter the
definition of honor without the
support of the “student generation.”
Changes will not take place if
students are reluctant to express their
opinions.

If you are troubled with the issues
I have raised, then talk with a
member of the EC and let him know
-that some students are troubled by
our community of honor.

14 women rally for DG

information about Delta Gamma for
those women deﬁnitely interested in
rush.”

According to Besenfelder, Delta
Gamma national representatives have
said that 32 women must commit to
rush in the fall before they will re-
turn to the university.

The main activity of the DGIG at
present is to get the word out that
DG is still on carripus and that DGIG
exists, said Beserifelder.

According to Besenfelder, mem-
bers of the Delta Gamma Interest
Group will go through a form of
“installation or ‘rush’ process through
which a distinction will be made
between those members who are
committed to rush next fall and those
women who are unsure.”

The first ceremony will be held
on Feb. 28 for those women com-
mitted to rush Delta Gamma in the
fall. *

Since the installation will not be
sponsored by Delta Gamma, an infor-
mal ceremony will be held for wom-
en who say they will definitely rush
in the fall.

Parihellenic President Nancy Mit-
chell said “There is nothing we
would like more than their success.”
She said, however, that Parihellenic
cannot recognize the group until they
ofﬁcially request such recognition.

DGIG members discussed social
activities as well as a philanthropic
project which may begin as soon as
they are recognized by Panhelleriic.

with the restriction on parties and
raised its ranking among fraternities
from fifteenth in the fall term last
year to fourteenth this fall term.
“The chapter also implemented
two ongoing community service proj-
ects to beneﬁt the community, both
of which were started this year and
will continue for years to come,"
Holland said, referring to Phi Delt’s
involvement in the Adopt a Highway
and Project Threshold programs.
Holland said the house has been
repaired completely and none of the
current members were involved in the
destruction of the house last spring.
Phi Delt Chapter Advisor and Pro-
fessor of Administration Joseph Gold-

sten, writing on behalf of the House
Corporation, submitted a letter Jan.
30 to Atkins that also requested the
temiination of the probation.

“The members clearly understood
that the future of the Phi Delta Theta
chapter at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity was in jeopardy, and have
responded in a positive, gentlemanly
manner,” Goldsten said.

In addition, Goldsteri said, “the
most signiﬁcant and pervasive change
that is associated with the probation-
ary period is a visible change in
attitudes. There is a true sense of
community and brotherhood. Mem-
bers do not tolerate the anti-social
behavior of a few. During the proba-

tionary period, abuse of property has
virtually been non-existent."

Phi Delt will continue to imple-
ment some of the stipulations of the
probation including continuation of
community service projects, Holland
said.

House mother Mata McGuire, who
has been a “primary force in posi-
tively altering attitudes and behav-
ior,” will remain at Phi Delt, Gold-
sten said.

Although Phi Delt has not official-
ly applied for the Fraternity Renais-
sance program, it will probably un-
dergo reconstruction beginning June 1
with the rest of the “Red Square"
fraternities, Atkins said.

MSA celebrates black history

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

The Minority Student Association
kicked-off its celebration of Black
Awareness Month last Thursday with
the first of a series of radio broad-
casts profiling major figures in black
history.

WLUR will broadcast these “Pro-
ﬁles in Black History” every class
day during February. They will be
read by freshman Curtis Joseph dir-
ectly following the news at noon.
Each proﬁle will consist of a srriall
biography of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in

black history ranging from civil rights
workers to scientists.

The radio spots are only one of
the planned festivities. On Feb. 14 at
4:30 p.m., there will be a community
reception at the Chavis House. At
that time, W&L students, as well as
the community, will have the chance
to talk one-on-one with black leaders
of Lexington and the University
body.
The Chavis House library will be
rededicated during the reception in
honor of a Black scholar. Officials
have said that educational pioneer
Carter G. Woodson is being strongly
considered for this honor.

Other scheduled events include

music days at Evans Dining Hall.
From Feb. 26-28, the dining hall will
air music by nationally known black
artists encompassing many different
music sectors.

Finally, black educational consul-
tant and author Jwanza Kunjufu will
lecture at Lee Chapel on Feb. 28.
Kunjufu will speak on the educational
deﬁciencies of black youth within the
public school system.

According to MSA president
James Rambeau, all of these activities
are “to provide the campus at large,

as well as the Lexington community, '

with exposure to a broader range of
"black culture and history."

K—Mart, Food Lion and Revco,
the three major tenants of the new
Stonewall Square shopping center
located on U.S. 60 east of Lexington,

K-Mart, which has moved into its
new 86,000 square foot store, is

ing on March 25. It will open its
doors, however, on March 22.

This K-Mart is one of the pilot

New members are elected by Phi
Beta Kappa members of the faculty,
staff and Law School on the basis of
Grade Point Average (GPA) and
program of study, said Goehring.

The national policy allowing only
the top 15 per cent of the senior
class is often reduced at W&L, al-
lowing fewer than the top 10 per
cent. Juniors are elected for Phi Beta
Kappa at W&L only if they have a
GPA of 3.9 or higher, said Goehr-
mg.
"There is not any assurance that
anybody over a speciﬁc GPA will get
elected," said Goehring. "Their pro-
gram of study must be liberal arts
oriented."

Two members of the Class of
1989 -— Tracy A. Williarns and
Kevin L. Yeager — were elected be-
cause they were eligible at graduation
but not at the time of election last
year.

Ward Wright Briggs, Jr., Class of

1967, will be the guest speaker at the
convocation and will be initiated as
an honorary member. He is a Pro-
fessor of Classics at the University of
South Carolina.

"Phi Beta Kappa is mainly in-‘
tended to honor and promote scholar-
ship; it doesn’t do things in a social
sense," said Goehring.

Founded at the College of Wil-
liam and Mary in 1776, Phi Beta
Kappa’s name is derived from a
Greek phrase meaning "philosophy -
- the guide of life."

It was founded as a secret social
and literary fraternity, but the secret
aspects were dropped in the early
l800’s when it became an honorary

-society based on scholarship.

There are currently about 240
chapters at liberal arts and humanities
oriented colleges and universities all
over the country, said Goehring. Phi
Beta Kappa publishes the Key Repor-
ter and American Scholar.

"Phi Beta Kappa was founded as
a socially active community for
people who were rather radical, for
an inter-play of intellectual tempera-
ments and minds," Goehring said.

The Gamma of Virginia Chapter
was founded at W&L in 1911 and
currently has about 45 faculty and
staff members, nine Law School
members and seven under-graduate
members, said Goehring.

Convocation will be on March 15,
during which the Phi Beta Kappa
Sophomore Award will be given to
the sophomore with the highest GPA.

MASTERCARD

SINCE 1963

 

 

By Jay Plotltin
Sports Editor

For the past month, the Washing-
ton and Lee basketball team has
struggled, miserably. ‘

For a while last week, it looked
like the funk the Generals had been
in throughout January was over. For
a while.

On Thursday night at Emory and
Henry, W&L turned in one of its
better halves of basketball in over a
month, but it wasn't enough as the
Wasps fought off the Generals to win
80-77.

E&H looked as if it would make
short work of the Generals. The
Wasps opened up a 31-18 lead mid-

 way through the first half. But the
 Generals hung tough. 'lhey fought
 back to 31-25 but fell behind again

38-25 minutes later.

The Generals closed the first half
with a 7-2 run to bring the game
back to 40-32. Junior captain Mike
Holton led W&L with 10 first-half
points.

Said Holton of the three-hour ride

 to Emory before the game, “I pretty
I, much said to myself, ‘enough is
37.: enough.’ If someone is going to do
 anything to get the team out of the
 doldrurris we've been in, it needs to

be me."
Holton continued his onslaught in

 the second half, and got help from
‘. ‘ his mates. E&H led 44-35 with 17:15
. ‘ to go when W&L went on its first
"' run of the second half. This 11111 gave
 the Generals their first lead since 2-

V, 0. Holton capped a 15-5 run with a
I three-point goal to give W&L a 50-
W 49 lead with 12:04 to play.

Making up the other half of the

 W&L backcourt during the run was
-. junior guard Andrew Manson, who

had a career high six points in his 11
minutes of handling the point guard
responsibilities.

E&H wasted little time in regain-
ing the lead. Luke Sampson followed
Holton’s three pointer with one of his
own to give the Wasps a 52-50 lead,
and Craig McLaughlin's lay up gave
E&H a 65-56 lead.

Again W&L seemed on the ropes,
but again they fought back, playing
like the W&L teams fans saw

throughout last season. When junior
forward Scott Alrutz picked up a
loose ball in front of the pack and
laid it in, W&L completed a 13-0 run
to take a 69-65 lead with 5:14 to
play.

Emory and Henry withstood the
run, and Leon Hill tied the game at
73 and the teams traded baskets until
E&H led 77-75. Junior guard Jim
Casey’s penetration and jumper tied
the game at 77 with 54 seconds to

‘Gilbert triple jumps way to

national championship meet

 

By Debbie Grove
Staff Reporter

Junior Carl Gilbert was as sur-

‘- prised as everyone else about qualify-
’ ing for the Division 111 national in-
. door championships in the triple jump
“ last Saturday at VMI’s Winter Re-

lays.

Gilbert, who placed third, was the
only Division III athlete to place in
any event at the meet. “After the
jump, I came out of the pit and fig-
ured I had jumped around 46 feet,”
Gilbert said. “When the armouncer
said 46 [feet]-11 [inches], I couldn't
believe it. It’s a feeling you can't
descri .”

Gilbert’: jump equaled the Divi-
sion III national standard. The nation-
al championship meet will be held at
Smith College in Northampton, Mass.
on March 9-10.

The junior from Bassett, Va. set
the school record in the triple jump
last spring, with a jump of 47-10.

Gilbert is also a member of the
41X)-meter relay team, which has the
best time in the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference this season.

Also faring well for the Generals

He was also all—ODAC in the

indoor title.

Gilbert set the triple jump school

After Casey tied the game, the
Generals forced a turnover with 17
seconds to play, the game still tied at
77. But Holton, who had been the
hero all night, made one fatal mis-
take. He was trapped in the back-
court and tried to loft the ball across
the court to Casey, but Derek Elmore
stole the pass for E&H and fed Hill
underneath the basket.

Holton arrived a split-second late

Smith extends win streak to 22
as swimmers sink Radford by 54

By John Laney
Stall‘ Reporter

The Washington and Lee men’s
swirmning team overwhelmed Radford
University on Saturday with a 107-
53 victory.

The 54-point margin of victory at
Radford was the largest for the Gen-
erals this season as they improved
their record to 7-5.

“I was real pleased with our
performance once again,” said head
coach Page Remillard. “We are
continuing to improve individually,
and that is helping us win the meets
we are supposed to win.”

W&L simply dominated Satur-
day's rrieet, winning ten of the 11
events and earning second-place
points in four events.

“We were a much better team,”
Remillard said. “Their [Radford’s]
team is very young. This is their first
year in swirnriiing.

“They ran a good meet and their
pool was super. It’s nice to have a
pool of that quality in the area. We
went front the worst pool (we've
seen this season) to the best pool in

one week,” Rernillard added, refer-
ring to the fact that Shepherd Col-
lege’s pool has only four lanes and
no starting blocks.

Sophomore Jay Smith improved
his unbeaten streak to 22 with a vic-
tory in the 100-yard freestyle (48.17).
Smith also bettered the qualifying
standard for the 100-yard backstroke
with his victory in the leadoff leg in
the 400-yard medley relay. Smith
finished his leg with a time of 54.80.

Coming into this season, Smith
had said he set a goal to consistently
swim the 50-yard freestyle in 21
seconds and the 100-yard freestyle in
47 seconds. Although his times have
somewhat slipped from his intended
goals during the last three meets,
Smith is still winning his races.

“It’s hard to be on top every
week," Remillard said. “I think he's
doing fine. He’s a super person, a
super student and a super athlete.”

The Generals’ roster was strength-
ened by the healthy return of junior
Jim Dunleavy, who had rriissed a
week of practice with a bout of the
ﬂu. "

Dunleavy won the 10()O-yard
freestyle event (10:09.44) and finished
second in the 500-yard freestyle
(5210.14).

“He seems to be back on track,”
Remillard said.

Both of W&L’s relay teams swam
to first-place finishes. The 400-yard
medley relay team composed of
Smith, sophomores Stuart Towns,
Doug Brown and Chip Nordhoff
finished in 3:57.54, while the 3:35.55

finish for the 400-yard freestyle med-
ley team (Smitl1, Nordhoff, freshmen
Andrew Pearson and Chris Hagge)
beat Radford's team by nearly 45
seconds.

Finishing out the individual victory
list for W&L were Brown in the 200-
yard and 500-yard freestyles
(1:54.58), (4:53.67), Towns in the
200-yard individual medley (2:O5.09)
and the 200-yard breaststroke
(2:23.51), Nordhoff in the 200-yard
backstroke (2109.07) and Hagge in the
50-yard freestyle (23.31).

The remainder of the Generals’
second-place finishes were collected
by freshman Marco Lotano, who

was good as Holton fouled him with
eight seconds left. The free throw
was good, and the Generals could
only get a desperation three point
shot from Casey, which was off the
mark.

Holton led all scorers with a
career high 26 points on 10-of-14
shooting. Junior center Chris Jacobs
was also in double figures for W&L
with 19.

The 80-77 loss left the Generals
12-8, 7-6 in the conference, but head

coach Verne Carifreld was pleased the
way his team played against the
hottest team in the conference. “We
played very well, well enough to win.
There were so many positive things
that came out of the second half,
maybe these young men can hold on
to that and we can go on from
here."

But the Generals did not hold on
to their second half play against E&H
back in rainy Lexington when they
took on conference foe Virginia Wes-
leyan on Saturday.

The Generals shot themselves into
a hole early and not even a red-hot
Pat Gallavan could shoot the Generals
out of it.

After a brief W&L lead, the Blue
Marlins took a 25-16 lead on a bas-
ket by Trevor Williams with 9:01 to
play in the half.

W&L then ﬂashed to life, sparked
by Casey’s breakaway lay-up and
went on a 12-0 run over the next five
minutes, capped by two free throws
from Manson. Five different players
scored for W&L during the run.

But VWC closed the half with an
8-2 run to lead 33-30, capped by
Daryl Reid's lay up at the buzzer.
The Generals found themselves in a
hole at the break mainly due to their
shooting, just 34 percent for the half,
while VWC connected on a 52 per-
cent clip.

In the second half, VWC pulled
out to a quick nine point lead on two
free throws by Williams with 12:56
to play. The lead then grew to 14
with 5:01 to play, 53-39.

Enter Gallavan. After missing his
first two shots, W&L’s version of the
Microwave set the temperature on
high, and proceeded to hit three con-
secutive three pointers to bring the
Generals within five at 53-48 with
3:21 to play.

After two free throws from Jacobs,
Gallavan struck again from three
point range, cutting the lead to 56-
53, but that would be as close as
W&L would get. VWC put the game
away from the free throw line, mak-
ing 13 of their last 15 over the last
two minutes to ice the 67-59 win,
extending the Generals’ home losing
streak to three.

Gallavan led W&L with 15 points,
all in the last four minutes of the

Struggling Generals look to start over

game on three point goals, and Casey
added 14. On the afternoon, W&L
shot just 29 percent. Holton and
Jacobs, the teams top two scorers,
shot a combined 2-of-21 and totaled
12 points.

So after a month of struggling,
Canfield has decided to start over.
“We’re taking the very positive ap-
proach that the struggle is over.
We're treating things like practice
started yesterday. The season starts
with Mary Washington.”

The Generals have lost five out of
their last six to fall to 12-9, 7-7 on
the season. However, Canfield warns,
“We’re not through yet."

Tonight the Generals will look to
bounce back in their final regular-
season home game against Mary
Washington. Game time is 7:30 in
the Warner Center.

Grapplers split at Gallaudet

By John Neumann
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team, led by freshman Rich Paini’s
two pins, picked up a decisive victory
over the host team after dropping an
initial decision to Washington and
Jefferson in last weekend’s Gallaudet
Triangular.

The Generals soundly defeated
Gallaudet, 38-16, after losing to a
tough W&J club, 28-15. Head coach
Gary Franke expressed surprise at the
ease of his club’s win over Gallaudet.
Commenting on the W&J match, he
said, “We just didn't come out with
enough individual performances to
win.” ’

The Generals jumped all over
Gallaudet from the beginning of the
match. Pairii recorded his fall with
just five seconds to go in the rriatch,
and junior co-captain Larry Pilkey,
grappling at 126-pounds, needed just
2:37 to pin his opponent.

Freshman Doug Lamb and senior
co-captain Lee Garlove each won by
forfeit, at 134 and 142 respectively.
After four quick matches the Generals
held a commanding 24-0 lead.

Ryland Scott, another freshman,

swam the 1000-yard freestyle in
10:29.11, Pearson in the 200-yard
freestyle (1:57.93) and Hagge in the
100-yard freestyle (51.04).

“Everybody had a good meet. The
optimism is there and rightfully so,”
said Rernillard.

The final dual meet of the season
for the men is at Mary Washington
on Saturday. The Generals have
never lost to the Eagles.

pinned his 158-pound opponent in
3:48. Freshman 167-pounder Jamie
Selway lost, and Franke was
prompted into some tactical moves to
secure W&L’s 30-12 lead. Franke
bumped sophomore Peer Soderberg
up two weight classes to 190 pounds.

In Soderberg's place at 177-
pounds, Franke sent junior Bill Avery
onto the mats. If Avery could avoid
being pirmed, the Generals would win
the match. The plan worked as Avery
only lost by decision and secured the
team victory for the Generals. It was
Avery’s first action of the season.

After spending the fall in China,
Avery rejoined the team after Christ-
mas and has been working out with
the team to regain his shape since
then. Franke did not feel he was
ready until this past weekend and has
held off using him.

The Generals won the final two
bouts to put some icing on the cake.
Soderberg did not seem to mind the
shift in weight classes, winning by
technical fall and Conkling sealed the
victory with an 8-7 heavyweight win,
only his second decision of the year.

The Generals did not fare as well
in the W&J match although some
bright spots did shine. Pairii recorded

another pin in this match, 5:26 into
the 118 match. Garlove soundly de-
feated his opponent 10-2 while Scott
squeezed out a 2-2 draw. Soderberg
registered a win, 4-0, at his more
comfortable 167-pound weight class.

Overall, Franke was pleased. “It
was a great team effort on our part
in both matches. We are where we
want to be conditioning-wise and we
are looking forward toward this
weekend’s Virginia College Division *
Championships.”

Next weekend’s championships at
Virginia State University in Peters-
burg include all Division H and III
Virginia schools. Norfolk State,
Newport News Apprentice, Longwood
College and Washington and Lee will
all compete along with Virginia State
for the title.

Franke believes that there are
strong wrestlers on every squad but
Virginia State and Longwood seem to
be the strongest along with Norfolk
State.

On February 14, Longwood Col-
lege will come to town for a dual
meet. “Longwood is tough and they
match up well against us, but I ex-
pect us to do well,” said Franke. The
match is slated for a 7:30 start.

Herring doubles, Sauers
breaks records in win  

From Staff Reports

The Washington and Lee wornen’s
swimming team recorded its second
win in its last three outings against
non-Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence opponents with a 114-87 win
over state rival Radford last Saturday.

Sophomore Jodi Herring-scored
two individual wins, and freshman
Stephanie Sauers set two school re-
cords as the Generals rolled over
Radford.

Herring set season—best times in
the 1,000- and 500-yard freestyle
events, winning with times of
11:19.79 and 5:33.11 respectively.
Sauers broke records in the 50- and
100—freestyle races, breaking records
set last year by Herring. Sauers’
times were 25.29 and 56.25 seconds
respectively.

Said head coach Page Reniillard,
“Stephanie is really coming on
strong. She is swirmning her lifetime
best times and has completely ad-
justed to our intensity level. Jodi
continues to lower her times.”

Junior Sharon Coleman, along
with Sauers, came within a fraction

of a second, ﬁve-one hundredths to
be exact, of qualifying for nationals.
Coleman set a season best time with
her win in the 200-butterﬂy.

Senior Kris Amoroso (200-free-
style), junior Rachelle Nock (200-
breaststroke) and freshman Claire
Dudley (200 IM) were also individual
winners. The 400 medley relay team
of Amoroso, Nock, Coleman and
Sauers also brought home a first
place for W&L.

“We’re coming back together
after hard training,” said Remillard.
“I also think the team is developing
a lot of confidence.”

Next Saturday W&L swims
against Mary Washington. A win
would bring the Generals’ record to
6-7 overall, 3-0 in the conference.
The Generals hold the best time in
every event in the conference except
the 1650, but Reniillard is confident
his team will take over the top time
in that event as well.

“We will get that time. And then
we'll be in position to win our third
straight ODAC title.”

The ODAC championships will be
held Feb. 23-24 at Hollins College.

Detail from the cover of Tom Wolfe's latest bestseller.

Wolfe’s Bonfire
hits silver screen

By Pat Lopes
Assignment Editor

Sherman McCoy will think he's at
the top. He’ll be the leading Wall
Street bonds broker. He’ll be married
and have a kid. And he’ll even have
a gorgeous girlfriend to fool around
with on the side.

But one evening as Sherman
McCoy drives through New York,
he'll find out that all the things he
has won't get him out of the mess he
drives into.

By December of this year, we’ll
be there to watch him as he burns in
Bonﬁre of the Vanities, a $30 million
movie based on Washington and Lee
alumnus Tom Wolfe's best selling
novel by almost the same name.

Wolfe also wrote the best seller
which became a 1983 block buster,
The Right Stuff.

Warner Brothers bought the mo-

tion picture rights to Wolfe's The
Bonﬁre of the Vanities and the lead-
ing roles have already been cast,
according to producer’s assistant Mo
_L_ospinoso.

Tom Hanks is Sherman McCoy,
Melanie Griffith is McCoy's girl-
friend Maria Ruskin and Bruce Willis
is Tom Fallow, a seedy journalist
who follows McCoy's downfall from
Wall Street wizard to Harlem jail
inmate, according to Lospinoso.

Brian de Palma is directing and
Fred Caruso is producing. De Palma
and Caruso have worked together on
Dressed to Kill and Blow Out.

The screenplay was written by
Michael Christopher, who also wrote
the screenplay for The Witches of
Eastwick.

Lospinoso said shooting will begin
in March on location, with street
scenes in New York and indoor shots
in Los Angeles.

The Ring-tum Phl, February 8, 1990

Senior behoids piece of history

By Tracey Thomblade
Staff Reporter

A spur-of-the-moment decision became a one of a
kind learning experience for senior Tie Sosnowski.

Tie, a European History major from Dallas, made a
quick dash to the Berlin Wall a few days before
Thanksgiving to become a part of history.

He decided to make the trip at 2 p.m., and later that
evening boarded a plane bound for Berlin. Tie made the
trip on the condition that he be back in time to meet the
family for Thanksgiving dirmer in St. Louis.

On the way to the airport his father expressed concern
over his son's sudden impulse. Tie justified his actions by
saying, “I pay $10,000 a year to study history, but I’m
only spending $1,000 to see history being made." Also,
Tie plarmed to sell pieces of the wall, or “Die Mauer”
as souvenirs to pay for his trip. -

Upon reaching Berlin, Tie caught a bus and made a I
beeline for the wall. His mission was to chip off the
piece where he had spray painted his name earlier in the
year, when he had travelled with the German department
during spring term.

Unfortunately he soon found that the section with his
name on it had been one of the few which had been
opened up for easier access between the two Berlins.

He set to work on another section and stored the
pieces in a hotel room across the street; When he left
Berlin the next day, Tie took with him eighty-seven
pounds of “Die Mauer."

When he returned home, he cut the stone and applied
asbestos sealant to keep it from crumbling. To the stones
he attached engraved gold plates. Tie sold the stones for
$30 apiece, including a photo of the piece still in the wall
and an affidavit of its authenticity.

The pieces sold so quickly that Tie decided to return
to Berlin two weeks later with his brother. This time he
pulled out about four hundred and fifty pounds of “Die
Mauer,” which he shipped back to the U.S. in a huge
crate.

Tie said the biggest problem in getting pieces from the »
wall was the police. “As long as you were casual about
it they didn’t care, but if you made too‘ much noise or
were obnoxious about it, the police would confiscate your
tools.” Often this meant throwing them into “no man’s '
land,” which is the space between the two walls V
separating East and West Berlin. Tie said he spent at
least ﬁve hundred dollars on tools while he was there.

After spending a few days in Berlin, Tie travelled
alone to Prague where he signed a petition for Havel to
become President. He had a difficult time getting into
Czechoslovakia, however, as he was there right about the
time of the revolution. After trying both the East and
West Berlin Czechoslovakian embassies, Tie finally drove
back through West Germany, followed its border to where
it meets the Czech border and entered the country at that
point. I

c The greatest things about his trip were “The people
I met and the conversations I had," said Tie. Despite the
language barrier, he was able to talk to several Germans,
including a student, Matthias Lehmann and an East

German soldier, Gurmard Reppin. Tie remembers vividly
the conversation with Reppin, who explained that both
East and West Germany need each other. He commented
that “The West Germans have eyes to see what they
want, ears to hear what they want, and feet to go where
they want, whereas East Germany has the soul which will
make the two one.”

When Tie returned home he was interviewed by
Channel 8 in Dallas, after which he received numerous
calls from people who wanted pieces of the wall. This
week he plans to travel to Washington, D.C., where he
will present his senators a.rId congressman with souvenirs.

Some of Tie’s memorabilia will be displayed in the
library  the near future and he may speak on campus.

A taste of old Mex is coming to Lex

By Spain Brumby
Stall’ Reporter

The Palms owner Wade Leslie has
answered the loud cry from W&L
students for a Mexican restuarant in
Lexington.

El Cafe, which will be located on
the comer of Main and Jefferson
Streets, will open this spring, Leslie
said. Leslie recently bought the build-

The Hodge Podge housewares and the

Jefferson Florist and Garden, which
he will convert to a restaurant.
According to Leslie, El Cafe will
feature a Tex—Mex cuisine, mostly
Mexican, including tacos, burritos,
and enchiladas. “Although the menu
has not been finalized, we do have
plans for several speciality dishes
which carmot be found at restaurants
such as Chi Chi’s," Leslie said.
Several W&L students have ex-

can restaurant in Lexington.

' Senior" Dede Connor, who eats out
several nights a week, said, “A Mex-
ican restaurant will be a nice change.
Lexington needs more choices of
restaurants. I just hope it opens
before I graduate!” Freshman Jen
Paciorek, when told about the plans

'for El Cafe said, “That's awe-
some!"

The Jefferson Florist has already

found a new location in Lexington at

Monday, Feb. 19.

Sally Lincoln, manager of The
Jefferson, says, “We are thrilled with
the new location. It is more open

and light.” She adds, “We are also
excited about the Mexican rest-
aurant.”

Hodge Podge closed last week.
According to Nell Byers, an employ-
ee, “Hodge Podge is not planning to
reopen in Lexington. However, we

Seniors reach new heights in K 2

By Todd Peppers
Entertainment Columnist

On Friday the Broadway hit K 2 opens at the
University Theatre. The play by Patrick Meyers is
a thesis project for Washington and Lee seniors
David Daves, Michael Dixon and Mary Hipp.

Daves is the director of K 2, Dixon acts in the
lead role of Harold, and Mary Hipp is responsible
for the light design. Dixon is joined by Washing-
ton and Lee sophomore Mason Pettit in the role as
Taylor, the only other character.

The title refers to the play’s setting: the second
highest mountain in the world. The play begins
shortly after the two men are caught in a climbing
accident that leaves Harold with a broken leg. At
first the two men desperately seek a solution that
will allow them to both descend the treacherous
slope; eventually they will come to the horrible
conclusion that only Taylor can leave the mountain.

The play focuses on the bond between the two
friends since, ultimately, Harold will order Taylor
"to salvage one life which can be saved, and to
live on for both of them."

In the February edition of the drama
department’s Curtain Call, director Daves wrote
that “the situation of two men facing a battle with
natural forces is not a new one. But what makes
the play so interesting is how the men, Taylor and
Harold, relate to each other...at first glance Harold
and Taylor seem to be complete opposites, black
and white. However, upon closer examination it
appears that rather than being opposites they are
each other's mirror image.”

Auditions

 

Daves added that “...in the end we are alone.
For Taylor and Harold, however different their own
lives are, in the end, meaning is given to them
through each other.”

On Monday I attended part of the K 2 technical
rehearsal. What I witnessed was not the ﬁnished
product; nor was I able to see the play in its
entirety due to the frequent stops. Yet the
“diamond in the rough” that I saw is rapidly
emerging into an impressive production.

One of the hardest chores an actor can face is
trying to rriaintain intensity while the ﬂow of the
play is constantly interrupted, yet both Dixon and
Pettit kept a high degree of concentration during
the practice. Both W&L students offer solid and
authentic characters.

Dixon has the daunting task of portraying the
crippled Harold. Daves wrote that because of
Harold’s disabilities “his ideas, thoughts, feelings,
had to be expressed solely through language. My
task as a director was to make this verbal activity
as essential and real as the physical activity of the
other character.”

Harold is a physicist and a devoted family man;
Taylor is a ﬁery district attorney who views love
as a battle zone.

Pettit, besides having to create the believable
character of Taylor, also gets to demonstrate his
mountain climbing skills. (Mountain climbing in a
theater? Just a testimony to Tom Ziegler’s set.)

During the two hours I spent in the theater, I
was impressed with both Pettit and Dixon; from
broken legs and shattered spirits, to hypothermia
and rage, their injuries and emotions rang true.

Moveover, I was struck with the way Daves

interacted with his actors. He hung on their every
movement and, during breaks offered praise, subtle
criticism, and suggestions. Both Pettit and Dixon
appeared to work well with their director.

The most striking aspect of K 2 is the set
designed by Tom Ziegler. I am constantly amazed
that, from such diverse shows as Little Shop of
Horrors to «No Exit, Ziegler, with the aid of
technical director Gary Hurniston, can offer such
superb sets. If Ziegler can consistently produce
these wonderful results in the cramped and
antiquated Troubadour Theatre, then his creative
genius will go wild in the Lenfest Center.

This particular set is unique. The audience does
not sit in the normal Theatre seats, but rather in
the downstage area of the stage. Soaring above
them is a 24 foot mountain side that is shrouded
in fog and stretches into darkness.

The actors are located on a small ledge which
is located on the side of the mountain. The play
opens with a five-minute sunrise and later features
a realistic avalanche scene. The illusion is perfect,
and Daves warns his potential audience to “bring
a coat; it gets very cold at 27,000 feet.”

I‘ will not assign K 2 one of my arbitrary
grades since I did not see either a finished or
complete product. But if my glimpse of the show
is at all accurate, then Daves, I-Iipp, and Dixon
have collaborated on a strong senior thesis.

Take a break from the movies and go see K 2.
The play opens Feb. 9 and runs through Feb. 14.
You can phone the Theatre at 463-8637 for
reservations. Plays do not come with movie ratings,
but the Curtain Call notes that adult language is
used in K 2.

Alum jumps into Panama

From Press Releases

“At the two-minute warning, I
was praying pretty well. At one
minute before the jump, I was pray-
ing like I’ve never prayed in my
life.”

That is how 2nd Lt. Jon Missert
described his first combat jump into
Panama on Dec. 21. A 1988 gradu-
ate of W&L, Missert was commis-
sioned in June of 1988 and is pres-
ently Company Fire Support Officer
with the 82nd Airborne Division at
Fort Bragg, N.C.

The 82nd Airborne was alerted at

9 a.m. on Dec. 18, drew equipment _

and moved to a secured area six
hours before the jump. The mission,
according to President Bush, “was to
safeguard the lives of Americans in
Panama, combat drug trafficking, and
protect the integrity of the Panama
Canal Treaty.”

When it came time to jump, Mis-
sert said he was scared, but there was
so much to do, and his ruck was

heavy, causing enough pain to make
him forget the fear. “The jump
looked fine,” he said, “until I looked
down to see tracers and burning .
buildings below me.”

Upon landing, Missert found him-
self in the backyard of a Panamanian
citizen. In broken Spanish, Missert
was able to communicate with him.
The Panamanian guided him toward
the airport and exclaimed, “Thank
God you're here.”

From there, Missert moved on
toward the airport to link up with his
company and continue the mission.
As Fire Support Officer, Missert was
to use artillery, air support and mor-
tar available to him and neutralize
PDF headquarters, thus clearing the
way for the infantry. Once this was
accomplished, the task left was basi-
cally for the infantry to go in and
mop up, Missert said.

While he was scared throughout
the military action, Missert knew the
importance of his mission and said he
thought it was necessary for the U.S.
to intervene. As a military officer,

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

secrecy rules

 

By Pat Lopes
“Assignment Editor

Executive Committee President Willard
Dumas Monday called for the appointment of a
.%Nhite Book Revisions Committee in response

0 suggestions from students that the EC di-
ivulge more information about investigations of
-possible honor violations.

Also at Monday’s EC meeting, the EC went

behind closed doors to hear a budget report
from FD Chairman Alex Hitz, who asked to
give his report in executive session. Dumas,

-‘Senior EC Rep. David Radulovic and Junior EC
Rep. John Fialcowitz voted against the motion

‘to close the hearing, but the motion to go into

,executive session passed, and a Phi reporter
was asked to leave the meeting.

3 Dumas said he decided to call for a new

‘revisions committee after attending a Law
School forum on the Honor System and the

‘White Book. He said he will present concerns

4expressed by the law students to the revisions
committee for its consideration.

J Dumas said several law students suggested
that students under investigation for possible
honor violations should be notiﬁed that they are

lbeing investigated.

Currently, students are not formally notified

by the EC unless the investigation is complete

;and the entire committee votes to hear the case
in closed trial. According to Dumas, students

{are not notiﬁed because it would be very
itlifﬁcult for them to work knowing they may be

ied for an honor violation.
“How many Washington and Lee students
wish to have their academic lives disturbed
when only one-fifth of the investigations have

(ended in closed hearings?" Dumas asked.

‘ Another concern Dumas said he will relate
to the revisions committee is whether the

icstudent body should be notified each time an
investigation is conducted. Currently, the student
body is not notiﬁed about an investigation

‘unless the person under investigation withdraws
or opts for a Student Body Hearing.

t Students participating in the forum suggested
the EC post notices stating basically what was
investigated and the result of the investigation.

Q

 
The White Book Revisions

Committee will consider
whether students should
know more about honor
investigations.

Dumas said the students were concerned about
an EC with the power to act in secrecy, with
no check provided by public records.

According to Dumas, the procedure for
investigations was designed to protect the
reputations of the accused and the accuser,
especially because most investigations do not
lead to hearings.

Dumas said is also concerned that regularly
releasing information about honor cases would
lead to a “codiﬁcation” of the honor system.
EC members would then cite past cases when
making decisions on later honor investigations.

“I can't stress how each case is unique,”
Dumas said.

The possibility of creating a separate EC for
the Law School was also discussed at the
forum and may be addressed by the revisions
committee, Dumas said. However, he said, there
is little support for separate executive com-
mittees for each campus.

“Most law-school students see the beneﬁts
of a collusion of law-school students and under-
graduates on the same committee,” Dumas said.

Both undergraduates and law students are
eligible to apply for positions on the White
Book Revisions Committee. Applications will
be available Friday at Carol Calkins’ ofﬁce in
the University Center and are due Monday,
March 12.

The EC will choose 12 committee mem-
bers, including a chairman.

Under the provisions of the White Book, a
White Book Revisions Committee must be
assembled once every four years. In addition,
the EC can call for a Committee when neces-
sary. The last time a revisions committee met
was in the 1987-88 school year.

That year, the committee held hearings in
Lee Chapel to measure student opinion.

9 Students planning to live in the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon or Red Square fraternity
houses next year probably won't be able to
move in until rriid-December, university
., ofﬁcials said this week.

“Nobody’s going to move in before the
end of the fall term,” said Associate Dean
of Students Leroy “Buddy” Atkins.

The SAE, Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta
Theta, Phi Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha
and Sigma Nu houses will be renovated
during the first phase of the Washington and
Lee Fraternity Renaissance, a $10 million
restoration project.

Though permission from the city is still
pending, officials say that work on phase
one could begin as early as mid—April and
might continue through December.

According to W&L’s coordinator of
1 capital planning, Frank Parsons, much of the

renovation work should be completed before

$.-

Oﬂtaf»-A

Dccember. But Parsons said safety concerns
and other delays are likely to make it easier
for students to plan to live elsewhere until
after Christmas.

Parsons said the university wants to
allow the construction company’s manager
to set his own work schedule.

“We’re giving him as much ﬂexibility
as possible to complete that enterprise,”
Parsons said.

The Renaissance is part of the univer-
sity‘s overall Master Plan for future con-
struction, which will be discussed at a city
Planning Commission meeting tonight.

Parsons said that, even if the commission
does not vote on whether to endorse the
plan at this meeting, the commission could
still recommend that Lexington City Council
schedule a public hearing when it meets
later tonight.

By state law, that hearing could not
occur before March 15. If the hearing is
held on or near that date, and council then
votes on and approves the plan by April 1,
that date “would not have an adverse im-

pact on the Red Square houses,” Parsons
said.

Current plans call for work on the SAE
house to begin early in spring term, and for
work on the Red Square houses to start
June 1.

Parsons said some preliminary estimates
as to how long the work would take did not
reflect “unknown conditions” that the cur-
rent schedule does leave time for.

“Sometimes you can never tell,” he
said. De—landscaping, excavation and asbes-
tos abatement could delay completion of the
project, said Parsons. This revised schedule
takes such possible delays into account, said
Parsons.

Also, even though construction might be
completed at some houses before it is at
others, furniture installation probably would
be done all at once and only after all the
construction is over, he said.

Nevertheless, Parsons predicted the
fraternities might be able to begin using
their houses for meetings and perhaps meals
before the end of fall term.

‘Red Square, SAE may be vacant through fall term

Students scramble for housing

The first phase of Washington and Lee’s
Fraternity Renaissance will force about 110 stu-
dents to ﬁnd other places to live, many more
than the university is now ready to provide
temporary housing for.

According to Assistant Dean of Students
Ken Ruscio, the university now has 35 beds re-
served for displaced students. “Until we have
a better reading of the numbers, we will stick
with that,” he said.

Ruscio last week sent a memo to the
freshman pledges of SAE, Beta Theta Pi, Phi
Delta Theta, Phi Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha
and Sigma Nu. The memo included a form
freshmen were asked to return by tomorrow if
they wanted campus housing.

Tuesday afternoon, "Ruscio said he had
received 30 applications from freshmen.

The entire central building of the Woods
Creek Apartments has been reserved for those
students displaced by the Renaissance, Ruscio
said. Those rooms will provide about 30 beds,

and ﬁve more will be available in Gaines Hall,
Ruscio said.

If further applications come in, according to
Ruscio, at least 15 more singles and doubles,
scattered throughout Gaines and Woods Creek,
could be made available. W&L also would look
into making singles into doubles and renting
houses in town if necessary, he added.

Associate Dean of Students Leroy “Buddy”
Atkins said housing displaced students in the
former Zeta Beta Tau house is also a pos-
sibility, but he said the cost to make that house
livable may run too high, perhaps as much as
$50,000. The total cost of renovating the ZBT
house is estimated at $400,000, according to
Atkins.

Both Ruscio and Atkins said displaced
juniors and seniors also will be able to apply
for university space. Those students can pick
up the necessary forms from the Dean of
Students’ ofﬁce, said Atkins. ,

Man accused of robbing profs

 

By Mike Badger
Staff Reporter

A suspect was arrested Feb. 2 for the
burglaries of two Washington and Lee
faculty members, according to the Rock-
bridge County Sheriff‘s Department.

Thomas R. Morke, 34, was arrested after
a high—speed car chase, according to Capt.
Ron Hall.

Hall said Morke eluded officers after
more than two hours of on-and-off pursuit
and then turned himself in to Lexington
Attorney Thomas M. Simons.

According to Sgt. Torben Pedersen of
the Lexington Police Department, Morke is
a suspect in both the Dec. 19 burglary of
football coach Gary Fallon and the Jan. 23
burglary of economics Prof. John Winfrey.

Patricia Fallon, Coach Fallon’s wife and
secretary to the Dean of Students, said her
husband was in Florida on a recruiting trip
and she was at work when their home at
916 Providence Place was burglarized.

Police reports show that the burglar
made off with over $1,500 worth of jewelry
from the Fallon’s house, including the
coach's 1959 National Championship ring
which he earned while playing football for

Car chase through Lex
finishes with a bang

By Robert Tompkins
Staff Reporter

A shot was ﬁred on West Washington
Street early Friday morning after a police
car chase through downtown Lexington.

The shot was apparently ﬁred accidental-
ly by a Lexington police ofﬁcer as he
attempted to get the driver out of a stolen
car in front of the Robert E. Lee Episcopal
Church at the comer of Washington Street
and Lee Avenue. No one was injured in the
incident.

Willie Preston Wills, 24, of Woodland

Avenue in Buena Vista, was arrested and
charged with stealing the vehicle and driving
under the inﬂuence. He is being held in the
Rockbridge County Jail in lieu of $7,500
bond.

Wills is accused of stealing the 1984
Ford Escort from his brother, Grover Wills,
in Buena Vista around 11 p.m. Thursday.
The theft was reported to Buena Vista
police about 12:30 Friday morning.

According to the Lexington Police

Department, Sgt. E. W. Straub saw the car
heading north on Main Street at the comer
of Preston Street in Lexington around 1 a.m.

Ci Please see CHASE page 4

Syracuse University.

According to Pedersen, the items stolen
from Winfrey’s home at 628 Stonewall St.
had a total value of between $12,000 and
$13,000. Pedersen said the burglar made off
with over $10,000 worth of silver alone.

Pedersen said Morke is also a suspect in
the burglaries of three students’ homes. Two
of those burglaries occurred in December;
the third was in November.

Hall said Morke has been charged with
ﬁve counts of breaking and entering and
eight counts of grand larceny in the county,
but he said Morke is a suspect in at least
25 to 40 different area burglaries.

 

Clarification

A story in last week’s Phi incor-
rectly described the current status of
the Delta Gamma Interest Group at
Washington and Lee. That group now
is composed of 16 undergraduate
women, said Panhellenic Association
Publicity Chairman Whitney Hopkins.

If the PHA proposal for DG’s
colonization rush is accepted by DG
nationals, the interest group will be

OPINION

 

Fighting back
for fraternities

It was only a matter of time. Once advocates of “civil
rights” and “opponents of discrimination” started bashing
judicial nominees for belonging to all-male clubs, single-
sex fraternities couldn’t be far behind on the list of targets.
But this latest front in the war against freedom of associa-
tion has opened up not, as one might expect, in a federal
courthouse or the halls of Congress; Middlebury College
has “seen the light" and ordered its all-male fratemities to
admit women or hit the road.

According to a story in The New York Times last month,
Middlebury President Olin Robison called the order by the
school’s trustees “an imaginative, creative, thoughtful and
workable approach.” He left out one important adjective:
unconstitutional. Somewhere at Middlebury, perhaps hidden
away in a dark comer of the library, is a copy of the U.S.
Constitution. Its First Amendment has some interesting
things to say about freedom of association and whether the
government can tell us who to spend time with.

True, Middlebury is a private school, and thus it can
legally enforce such a rule. But should a college be in the
business of teaching unconstitutional behavior by example?
Is it appropriate for Robison and the school’s trustees to
tell their students that they know best how their students
should socialize? If the school wants to support coed

groups, that’s one thing; to demand that all groups admit.

women — or anyone else — is quite another.

The practical effects of Middlebury’s rule, it seems, will
be to drive fraternities off campus. Under the board’s
decision, Middlebury fraternities must change any national
rules excluding women or break their national ties
altogether. Faced with no national support and thus no
practical way to obtain insurance, the fratemities at
Middlebury seem doomed.

What of sororities? Middlebury’s all closed down in the
1960s, the Times said. Hopefully, schools with both
sororities and fraternities won’t be in a hurry to follow
Middlebury’s example.

Which brings us to Washington and Lee, a school that
has demonstrated a commitment to supporting fraternities
and sororities. Rather than driving such groups off campus,
President John Wilson and the university’s trustees have
recognized the value of a strong Greek system and are
working to eliminate only its faults and not the
organizations themselves.

Fraternities and sororities are composed of human
beings. They aren’t perfect. The appropriate response to
that fact is to preserve what is good and correct what is
bad, not to trash the system altogether.

W&L’s Fraternity Renaissance is perhaps the nation’s
best example of that philosophy. The process will not be

V easy, as many freshmen learned last weekend, when they

received "a" 1erte‘r°abour:htsusin'g;' options" for‘”‘the“'fall ‘from
Associate Dean of Students Ken Ruscio. They and their
brothers must realize that, like the Honor System, frater-
nities are not easily preserved, but the benefits both pro-
vide outweigh the challenges ahead. The inconveniences the
freshmen and their brothers will face next year are a small
price to pay.

Don’t destroy our Honor System I

MY VIEW
By Billy Geary

I have always been the type of person who
does not blindly accept the status quo — I ﬁnd out
why something is the way it is. I must admit that
when I started law school, I was somewhat cynical
about the operation of the Honor System. However,
I took the time to discover how the Honor System
works and what the concept of “honor” means. I
now ﬁrmly believe in the Washington and Lee
Honor System.

In discussing the Honor System, it is useful to
visualize three categories of honor-related behavior.
First, there is behavior that is “clearly acceptable.”
This is behavior that raises no ethical problems.
Second, there is behavior that is “clearly
unacceptable.” This is behavior that everyone
would view as dishonest, such as copying an exam
from someone else’s blue book. Finally, there is
behavior that falls in the “gray area.” Behavior
that falls in this category is acceptable to some
people, but dishonorable to others. It may involve
“minor” violations of honor. This behavior may
be tolerated at some schools. However, it will get
you into trouble here if you underestimate the
meaning of “minor.”

The Honor System at W&L seeks to discourage
behavior that is not “clearly acceptable.” It

requires you to sense behavior that could be
viewed as “gray" and to correct it by either
changing your behavior or by asking for advice.
This is the only way to insure that high standards
of honor are followed.

People fear that they might do something
without thinking and then get charged with an
honor violation. Unfortunately, this fear causes
people to miss the point. One of the main purposes
of the Honor System is to require you to think
before making decisions.

A separate EC for the Law School?

It is nothing new for lawyers to think they are
special and thereby deserve to sculpt their own
standards and procedures. The idea of a separate
EC for the law school is untenable for several
reasons. First, there aren’t enough people in the
law school with the energy and time to build and
sustain a workable EC. As part of the Student Bar
Association, I know for a fact how hard it is to
get law students involved with university affairs.
Even if the Law School had its own EC, it would
not eliminate the proponents’ basic fear, which is
“What if I get convicted of an honor violation for
doing something I didn’t know was wrong?” If
one has this fear, then he will have it no matter
where the EC is or how it operates. A dichotomy
in the Honor System would further weaken the
fragile but important relationship between the
undergraduate and law schools.

What are Law School standards? P

It amazes me that law students would be more‘
concerned than the undergraduates about the Honor,
System. Law students do have a few more years
behind them, and should have a clearer sense of ‘l
right and wrong. They should be better able to,
control their own behavior. Ethics is a paramount
concern of lawyers today, and it is important for’:
would-be lawyers to think about their behavior in
a variety of unstructured situations. Although I hear \
law students complain about the procedures of the?
EC, I am concerned that they are really unhappy‘-
with the standards applied by the EC. If there is
to be a different standard of honor in the Law,
School, then it should be raised commensurate with
our age, experience, and aspirations. Unfortunately,"
it appears that age and experience have little to do,
with our understanding of honor.

Improving the Honor System ”

The administration can help by fully describing 5
the Honor System in the catalog and on a form
that each applicant should read and sign. This form
should describe the pros and cons of the Honor»
System. In this way, applicants will be put on
notice, and those who do not want to attend a’
school with an honor system like ours can select a,
school which meets their individual needs and
beliefs. W&L can afford to be selective bothv
academically and in terms of the student’s belief in

THE SBAR SIDE

By Jon Sbar
While in the midst of an
extremely important homework

assignment, I was afflicted with a
severe case of writers’ block. Right
now I can’t remember what class this
homework assignment was for or
even, for that matter, if it was for a
class, but I do know it was a matter
of life or death.

I absolutely had to do the assign-
ment, yet at the same time I couldn’t
shake my writers’ block. I burned
incense and still couldn’t write. I
inverted my computer screen to green
on black and it didn’t improve. I
went outside and inhaled gasoline
from my neighbor’s lawn mower and,
though I felt better, I still couldn't
write a word. I tried herbal tea, elec-
trocution, swimming naked in the
Maury River — and still nothing.

The moming sun was already
rising on the horizon and my deadline
was fast approaching. As I looked
hopelessly out of the window, a wave
of panic rushed through my body.
Suddenly, I heard the rhythmic thud
of heavy boots climbing the stairs.
Who could that be, I wondered. Did
I remember to lock the basement
door? The thudding boots echoed
down the hall and stopped outside my
room. As the doorknob on my closed
door began to turn, I lunged for the
handgun under my bed  wait a
minute, this isn’t a suspense thriller
 it’s a story about my writers’
block.

Let’s go back to the wave of
panic. I could not suffer one minute
more of my writers’-block misery. I
procured an electric ginsu kitchen
knife, plugged it in and, just as I was
about to plunge it into my heart, a
gigantic bengal tiger wearing hom-
rimmed glasses and holding an un-
abridged dictionary suddenly materi-

alized before my eyes.

Later I was to learn that he was
Tony, the inspirational tiger from
Frosted Flakes cereal, and that he had
come to help me do my homework.
At the time, however, I mistook him
for one of the man-eating bengal
tigers from Asia that is regularly
featured on public television wildlife
programs, and I reacted the way any
young, brave, testosterone-laden Am-
erican male would have in the situa-
tion: I dived under the bed.

After Tony told me who he was
(and proved it with his Frosted
Flakes ID card), I recalled the televi-
sion commercials in which he inspires
a struggling young athlete to rise to
his fullest potential by giving him a
bowl of cereal and a pep talk.

What Tony did for me was even
better. Instead of inspiring me to get
over my writers’ block, he did my
homework by himself. I just sat there
in the background eating Frosted
Flakes cereal (I didn’t tell Tony that

I prefer Cap’n Crunch). Tony, who‘
types about 300 words per minute,v
rapidly ﬁnished my assignment. He.
then printed it out, stapled it together
and reached out to hand it to me. I‘?
moved to take it, but all of the sud-
den my room was cloudy  I blindly
stabbed my hand into the mist  and ,
ﬁnally grasped  my buzzing alarm
clock. HOLD IT! This isn’t one of
those happy stories that later turns.
out to be only a dream, it’s an article
about a guy with writers’ block. Tony I
really did do my homework and, for
that matter, he did it well (Man, that '
tiger could write). .
Now that I had my homework
done, I ﬁgured I could afford to relax y
a little. I turned on the television to
the “Three Stooges.” The episode ‘
had already started, so I had to con-
centrate to understand the plot. Curly
was mixing drinks in a rubber boot 3

meringue pies at each other and at V

     
   

  
 
 

 
  
   

 
  

   

’9O Lip Synch:
doubling last
year’s success

The Fourth-Annual Lip Synch contest to
beneﬁt Multiple Sclerosis (MS) was, once again,
a success beyond all expectations. Last year’s
proceeds of $1,100 were doubled this year as the
contest raised $2,156.16.

So many people need to be thanked: the 19
groups that performed, the 28 local merchants
who donated door prizes, Pepsi Cola Company
who donated the T-shirts, Brandon Canaday, Joei
Dyes, Scott Jackson, Bill Torrence, Mary Martin,
Janet Goad, Carol Calkins, Bob deMaria, Tom
Tinsley, Demaree Peck, Anne Coulling, etc.,
people who committed so much of their time and
expertise to make the event so successful.

If you were in the Ukraine and haven't heard
yet  yep, the FIJI’s successfully defended their
crown, performing “Jungle Love,” followed by
The Lord’s Ladies performing “It's Just the Way
that You Love Me,” and third prize going to the
D-53's version of “Love Shack.”

Very honorable mention went to The New
Kids/Donn Counsellors performing “Hanging

LETTERS

Tough.” Apologies to the 100 or so people who
had to be turned away at the door due to the
crowded conditions.

Tentative plans for 1991 are to accommodate
everybody at the pavilion. On behalf of v the
Multiple Sclerosis Society — thank you one and
all — you are the best!

Sincerely,
Jerry Darrell
Advisor, Students Against MS (SAMS)

Thanks for a
granted wish

This thank-you goes to those members of the
Washington and Lee community and everyone
else who helped make our son Shanen’s trip to
Disney World a success. Every time a smile
came on his face, it made us think of those
responsible for his being there.

Our hearts will always be touched by your
generosity. Also, that your love and concern for
such a darling little boy made life a little easier
for all of us.

With heartfelt thanks,

Library cages
costly disks

I would like to add my voice to those of
others in this paper who have expressed opinions
about the Honor System. The University Library
has experienced two expensive thefts the past two
weekends, and I want the entire Washington and
Lee community to know about them. We sub-
scribe to several reference tools in CD-ROM
format. Three of these titles — the Business
Periodicals Index, the Social Sciences Index, and
the Humanities Index — use the same software.
In the spirit of trust and honor, we have kept
three discs (one of each title) adjacent to the
microcomputer in the Reference Room so that a
user can easily switch from one to another. Now
two discs are missing — one for the Business
Periodical Index and one for the Social Sciences
Index. To insure access to these sophisticated
tools by our students and faculty and to protect
the library's investment, I have removed the discs
from open access to the Circulation Desk where
they will have to be signed out. I wish that had
not been necessary.

Chemistry Professor Dr. J. Keith
Shillington is recovering slowly but
steadily from a mild stroke, and Golf
Coach Emmett “Buck” Leslie is
back on the golf course while under
treatment for chronic leukemia.

Shillington suffered a stroke Jan.
10, spent ten days at Stonewall Jack-
son Hospital and has been at the
Stonewall Jackson Extended Care
Facility ever since, said Chemistry
Prof. William Watt.

Shillington is under therapy to
regain full use of his left side, which
he lost as a result of the stroke, Watt
said. He is now able to stand for
short amounts of time and walk with
assistance, but use of his left hand is
coming back slowly.

Shillington is tired of being in the
hospital but visitors really cheer him
up, Watt said.“He’s not at all happy
about the long stay, but he's still
cracking jokes.”

Watt said Shillington telephoned
him on Jan. 9 to say he was feeling
dizzy and would not teach class the
following day. He said Shillington
called again the next morning, saying
he thought he had suffered a mild
stroke and was having difficulty
moving the left side of his body.

Watt said he convinced Shillington
to go to Stonewall Jackson immedi-
ately. He was sent to Roanoke for
tests and returned to Stonewall Jack-
son Hospital that night, where he
stayed for ten days.

Shillington has been teaching
chemistry at Washington and Lee
since 1953 and has been crowning
the Homecoming Queen every fall for
25 years.

The Athletic Department is also
missing one of its long-time mem-
bers. Five days before Shillington’s
stroke, Leslie was diagnosed as hav-
ing chronic leukemia and was admit-
ted to the rehabilitation hospital in
Roanoke, he said. He was also diag-
nosed as a diabetic with an enlarged
spleen.

The Ring-tum Phl, February 15, 1990

—\

Prof, coach feeling OK

Leslie has taught physical educa-
tion at Washington and Lee since
1960. He said he went to Stonewall
Jackson for a physical because he had
been fatigued and was immediately
sent to Roanoke for tests.

Unlike acute leukemia, chronic
leukemia does not arise abruptly and
progress rapidly. While survival is
measured in months for acute
patients, chronic leukemia is not as
dramatic and carries fewer complica-
tions.

Leslie's doctor in Roanoke gave
him the go-ahead for coaching the
golf team after a check-up on Jan. 26
showing that his spleen had gone
down and his blood sugar level was
under control, said Leslie.

An out-patient at Stonewall Jack-
son Hospital, Leslie is not on medica-
tion now, he said.

Although Leslie has temporarily
stopped teaching P.E. classes and
supervising the outdoor athletic facili-
ties, he said he hopes to resume all
his responsibilities soon and may be
able to teach this spring.

World class piper pipes for W&L

 

By Blair Simmons
Staff Reporter

World class Highland Bagpiper Scott MacAulay
said at the beginning of his recital Monday night
in Lee Chapel that he would be complimented if
the audience dozed off during his performance.
After all, it’s pretty hard to fall asleep to a bad
piper.

MacAulay’s music rang through the chapel as
he marched across the stage during Scottish and
Irish marches, tapped his toes to jigs and reels and
piped Waltzes sounding little like conventional
waltz music.

“The very extraordinary thing about Scott is
that he has excelled in amazingly diverse modes of
piping,” said W&L freshman Niall MacKenzie, a
student of MacAulay.

The highland bagpipe, unlike the lowland
bagpipe, plays only nine notes and cannot change
keys, MacAulay said. This lack of variety severely
limits the range of music the bagpipe can play.

The highland bagpipe has three stocks that lay
against the shoulder-- one base and two tenors--and
is blown by mouth. The lowland pipe has only one
stock with three separations and is blown by a
device called a bellow, said MacAulay. The differ-
ences make the lowland pipe much quieter.

“The lowland pipe wouldn’t bother anyone,”
said MacAulay. “But we have to condition our

listeners."MacAulay wore traditional Scottish
formal dress--the orange and green tartan kilt of
the MacAulay clan, a wide leather belt with large
brass belt-buckle, white wool knee-socks, shoes
with laces wrapped around his ankles, a cropped
jacket and a cap. Between sets he explained
traditions of bagpipe playing.

“We in piping don’t actually play in recitals to
gain respect from our peers,” MacAulay said.
“Sadly we must earn respect in the competition
arena.”

A piping contest repertoire usually consists of
a march, a jig, a reel and a waltz, MacAulay
said.The bagpipe has been played since the beginn-
ing of musical documentation, MacAulay said.
Scots kept playing the bagpipe even when it went
out of style in Europe, so when the bagpipe is re-
ferred to today, it is usually the highland pipe.

The bagpipe has been used throughout history
as an instrument of war to incite people to battle,
MacAulay said. Consequently, bagpipes have been
outlawed in Scotland at times. They have also
been banned from churches because they incite

people to dance, MacAulay said.

MacAulay, 31, was born and raised in Canada
but both his parents are Scottish. A member of an
Isle of Lewis family, which is famous for its
Gaelic musicians, MacAulay said he has been
playing the bagpipe since he was nine years old.

“I don’t really remember not playing,” Mac-
Aulay said. “It just feels so natural.”

MacAulay has been competing professionally
since he was 14 years old, and he performed in his
first paid recital when he was 16, MacKenzie said.
MacAulay has been teaching for more than ten
years.

Described by MacKenzie as a “gifted and
prolific” composer, MacAulay has recently pub-
lished a collection of music for the pipes.

MacAulay has been active in re-integrating the
highland bagpipe as a ‘‘folk’’ instrument. He has
also played in a variety of musical ensembles,
including jazz, traditional and rock n’roll, MacKen-
zie said.

Probably the most consistently successful
competitive solo piper of his generation, MacAulay
has won almost every top prize in Scotland and
North America several times, MacKenzie said.
MacAulay said he only practices four to five hours
a week.

“I have to be in the mood, and when I am, it’s
really hard to stop,” MacAulay said.

MacKenzie a University Scholar, organized
MacAulay’s visit to W&L through the Music
Department and the University Scholars program.
MacKenzie also lives in Ottawa, Canada.

“We all have healthy lungs," MacAulay said
when asked about the life-expectancy of bagpipers.
“Most bagpipers die of cirrhosis of the liver.

“Most pipers I know live life to the full. They
play hard and they party hard and they love their
music.”

Terry to defend VMI male-only policy

By Jason Kelley
Staff Reporter

The battle to save Virginia Mili-
tary Institute’s male-only admission
policy has drawn two possibly incom-
patible lawsuits from the state attor-
ney general and VMI’s private fund-
raising organization.

The two suits were ﬁled in re-
sponse to U.S. Attorney General Dick

V Thomburgh’s threat to sue the state
unless a plan to end the single-sex
policy is presented by Feb. 20

According to The Associated

Press, Deputy Attorney General R.
Claire Guthrie said the attorney gen-
eral’s suit represents VMI as an
element of a diverse system of state
institutions, while the VMI foundation
action casts the school as unique.

“Only one of these cases can go
forward. These are fundamentally
incompatible arguements and they
can’t both succeed," said State Attor-
ney General Mary Sue Terry.

Terry, Virginia’s first female
attorney general, filed a lawsuit on
Feb. 5 asking the U.S. District Court
in Richmond to declare VMI’s exclu-
sion of women as constitutional under
the Education Amendments of 1972
and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

“Admission of women to the
VMI undergraduate four-year program
is not necessary to provide equal
educational opportunities for women
within the Virginia system of higher
education,” the lawsuit said.

The suit filed by VMI Foundation
Inc. asked the U.S. District Court in
Richmond to rule that Thomburgh
lacks the authority to prosecute the

school over its admission policy.

The Justice Department says
VMI's policy violates the equal pro-
tection clause of the 14th Ammend—
ment to the Constitution and the Civil
Rights Act.

VMI recieved $11 rriillion in state
funds this year, almost half its $25
million budget, and all cadets are
enrolled in ROTC and therefore
recieve federal aid.

The Justice Department began
investigating the case in March 1989
when it recieved complaints from a
female northern Virginia high—school
junior who wanted to apply to VMI.

Former Governor Gerald Baliles
told the VMI board in May that the
admissions policy was illegal, and in-
cluded in his proposed 1990-1992
state budget $160,000 to provide
barracks for women at VMI.

Terry's suit said the Justice De-
partments finding “was made without
any inquiry into the state interest
served by VMI and without any visit
to VMI to review first-hand its pro-
gram of instruction."

The suit was filed after VMI’s
board of visitors unanimously decided
to uphold the school’s admission
policy.

Terry said that women who want
a military-school lifestyle can enroll
in the ROTC program at Virginia
Tech, also a state supported school.

Terry appeared Tuesday on the
NBC “Today Show,” and when
asked about the irony of her role as
a woman attorney general defending
the school’s exclusion of women, she
replied that the fact that those ironies
are present does not keep her from
doing her job.

wealthy bystanders dressed in tuxe-
dos.

I found the whole thing extreme-
ly humorous and stopped laughing
only to answer the ringing telephone.
It was Leonora, whom I secretly
love. She told mejthat she was leav-
ing that evening for the African Con-
go. I had to tell her how I felt before
she left. “Leonora,” I said nervously,
“before you go I must tell you that
 that this is NOT a romance story
 it’s an article about my writers’
block.”

Since the “Three Stooges" epi-
sode was finished, I decided to go to
my favorite truck stop for breakfast.
I picked a table near the jukebox and
sat down. While contemplating the
menu, I noticed that a large, tobacco-
spitting, professional-wrestling-patron-
like, neanderthal-type man was staring
rudely at me. A couple of minutes
later, he stood up and walked over to
my table.

“Hey geek," he said, “how ’bout

givin’ me yur lunch money ’cuz if
you don’t I might bust yur eye
glasses in half." HOLD IT! This
isn't one of those “nerd getting
pushed around by a bully” stories,
it’s about a guy with writers’ block.
There wasn't any redneck staring at
me in the truck stop.

After finishing my meal, I tried
to pay with a check, but my writers’
block prevented me from doing so.
After some strenuous bartering, I paid
with a couple of gold teeth.

Climbing into my car, I noticed
that the passenger seat was occupied
by my editor. I knew what had to be
done. I slowly moved my hand to the
dagger under my seat. My blood-
thirsty hands were clutching the ivory
hilt when I remembered that this isn't
a revenge story (and that I don’t even
own a dagger with an ivory hilt).

“You know something,” my
editor said, “I think this article is
getting a little long for someone who
keeps mentioning his writers’ block."

lent job this year. Although the EC
may be open to suggestions for im-
provement, they won’t respond well
to the destruction of a system which

has, not unlike the common law, been
refined over many years to reﬂect our
current value system. Constructive
change is desirable. However, change
must be rational and carefully consid-
ered, or it will degrade the system
rather than improve it. We encounter
plenty of examples of ill-considered
change in a variety of situations
including corporate restructuring to
the latest computer program that
crashed the AT&T telephone network
for half a day. We are all part of this
university system, and should work
within the current system to effect
any changes. If you feel that you
must scrap the system, then perhaps
Washington and Lee is not the school
for you.

Straub reported that the vehicle
continued north on Main Street to the
comer of Washington Street, where it
ran the red light and headed west.

Officer Mark Ramos joined the
chase on Washington Street. Ramos
and Straub cut the car off at the
comer of Lee Avenue, police said.

Both officers approached the car
with their guns drawn and ordered
the driver of the car to get out sever-
al times, according to police reports.
As Ramos neared the car, the driver
opened the door, striking Ramos’s
gun and causing it to fire into the air,
police said.

The officers then forcibly removed
the driver from the car, police said.
The stolen car, which had been left
in neutral, then rolled back into
Straub’s car but caused no damage,
said police.

Washington and Lee sophomore
Craig Lang lives in the Sigma Chi
house on the comer of Washington
Street and Lee Avenue. His second-
floor room overlooks the intersection
where police arrested Wills.

“Both [policemen]
were right in the
guy’s face.... I
thought they had
shot him in the
head.”
— Craig Lang

Lang said he saw both policemen
jump out of their cars, draw their
guns and then order the driver to get
out of the car.

“They didn't wait long," said
Lang, “Both [policemen] were right
in the guy’s face." When the gun
went off, Lang said, “I thought they
had shot him in the head.”

“It looked like the door hit the
gun and made it go off," said Lang.

Wills was arraigned Friday in
Rockbridge General District Court. A
preliminary hearing has been sched-
uled for Feb. 15 in Buena Vista
General District Court.

Dumas said the decision to hold
similar hearings this year is up to this
year’s committee, which will also
determine how students can submit
their suggestions for consideration.

In other business, the EC called
for a meeting of the Constitutional
Revisions Committee to review the
Student Body Constitution, which
covers aspects of student government
not honor related.

“The committee will try make it
a more cohesive and ﬂexible docu-
ment that isn’t so rigid and steeped
in ambiguity," Dumas said. Dumas
was speciﬁcally referring to sections
dealing with elections and the succes-
sion of officers. He said rules for the
timing of elections are too rigid
because there are no allowances for
year to year changes in the timing of
breaks. Ambiguity in the section con-
cerning succession became evident
last spring when the president-elect
withdrew from school, touching off a
heated debate concerning the succes-
sion of the elected officers, Dumas
said.

Outdoor drama companies
to hold auditions in March

From News Releases

Thirteen outdoor historical drama
companies will be auditioning per-
formers and technicians for summer
jobs March 24 at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The auditions, sponsored by the
UNC Institute of Outdoor Drama, are
open to anyone 18 years or older
with previous theater training or
experience.

From Cry of the Wild Ram on
Kodiak Island, Alaska, to The Lost
Colony on Roanoke Island, these
original outdoor dramas are based on
actual events and performed where
they took place. More than 75 pro-
ductions nationwide employ some
3,000 actors, singers, dancers and

. technicians each summer.

The Institute of Outdoor Drama
sponsors the only combined auditions
in the country designed to bring

outdoor historical dramas and per-
formers and technicians together in a
single location, said Judy Via, audi-
tions coordinator.

“Performers and technicians at-
tending the auditions should be pre-
pared for a busy day, beginning with
registration at 7:30 am. and ending
with callbacks late that afternoon,”
Via said.

“Actors present a one-minute
prepared monologue and may offer
another at callback interviews,” she
said. “Singers are asked to prepare
one song. Dancers will be led
through warm-up, assorted combina-
tions and across-the-floor routines
using ballet, modern and folk chor-
eography. Technicians interviews will
take place during the aftemoon.”

Outdoor theater offers performers
and technicians the opportunity to use
and expand their skills in an uncon-
ventional environment, while being a
part of a large cast, long-run produc-

Former cadets given

 

By Pat Lopes
Assignment Editor

Two former Virginia Military
Institute cadets were sentenced Jan.
29 to five years in prison and the
father of one of the cadets was sen-
tenced to eight years and one month
for their roles in a $4.4 million ar-
mored car robbery 14 months ago in
Trenton, N.J.

Robert Jasinski, 51, of Boonton,
N.J., received a longer sentence be-
cause he coerced his son, William,
22, and fellow cadet Bryan Smals,
21, of Columbus, Ohio, into par-
ticiapting in the heist, said U.S. Dis-
trict Judge Garrett Brown, according
to an Associated Press story.

Authorities said the two cadets
were heavily armed and posing as
police officers on Dec. 22, 1988,
when they hijacked a truck from the
Eizabeth—based Coin Depot Armored
Car Corp.

The cadets held two guards at gun
point as they unloaded the truck and
then escaped in a getaway car driven
by the elder Jasinski.

After being questioned by FBI

officers a month after the robbery,
the elder Jasinski confessed to the
robbery. He then lead agents to a
home in Parisppany, NJ. where most
of the money was hidden in an attic.

The day after the elder Jasinski’s
arrest, FBI agents questioned the
younger Jasinski and Smals in Lex-
ington and they also confessed. The
two cadets resigned from VMI the
following day.

In addition to handing down the
sentences, Judge Brown ruled the
three men and a fourtli accomplice,
Ronald H. Strsriu, 55, of Union,
N.J., must pay restitution to cover the
$261,015 not received from the rob-
bery. Stromp, who stood by as a
look-out during the robbery, pleaded
guilty and will be sentenced on Tues-
day.

According to Brown, sentencing
of the two young men was complicat-
ed because authorities needed to
communicate the severity of the
crime but at the same time had to
take into consideration that the cadets
were doniineered by Robert Jasinski.

“Mercy must be balanced with
the concerns of society and the nature
of the crime,” said Brown as he

tion provides invaluable experience.
And the outdoor amphitheater, with
its requirements of vocal and physical
projection, challenges the performer
trained in traditional theater to dis-
cover new limits.

Employment in an outdoor drama
requires a nine- to 12-week commit-
ment, including three weeks of re-
hearsal and an eight- to ten-week
session. Companies may offer addi-
tional productions, experimental
theater and workshops, children's
theater productions and college credit
programs. Some of the major com-
panies offer subsidized or paid hous-
ing, or will help members find hous-
mg.

Applications must be received by
Monday, March 19. To request ap-
plication materials, send a self-ad-
dressed, stamped envelope to: Audi-
tions Coordinator, Institute of Outdoor
Drama. CB# 3240, NCNB Plaza,
UNC, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3240.

five years

sentenced the two former cadets.
“They were both Vulnerable but they
did know that what they were doing
was wrong.”

Judge Brown also hit on the for-
mer cadets’ military education, saying
they had “substantial rriilitary training
and farnilialarity of firearms and used
they to perpetuate this crime."

According to William Jasinski’s
attorney Bruce Goldstein, the elder
Jasinski is a violent authoritarian,
preoccupied with guns and the-rni1i-
tary. Robert Jasinski’s attorney, Ed-
ward Dauber, said William was not
motivated by the millions of dollars

in the armored truck as much as his
wantin “to see what could be

8
done.”

Goldstein said Robert Jasinski
often jabbed pressure points on his
son’s body and commanded: “You
will do what I want you to do.”
Before sentencing, the elder Jasinski
asked the court to give his son and
his son's friend a lighter sentence.

“I ask mercy for the boys,” Ja-
sinski said. “They followed me as
the leader in the true military fashion
to which they were trained.”

Staff Reporter

In a recent issue of Rolling Stone,
Jack Bruce, the bassist and co-
founder of the Sixties’ supergroup

ream, had this to say about former
band member Eric Clapton; “I notice
Eric’s new album is called Journey-
inan. I don't buy that.”
-1 Obviously he hasn’t bought the
album; otherwise he would be swal-
llowing his foot. A "joumeyman" is
? skilled and reliable worker or per-
ormer; it also implies a person who
has undergone a long journey of one
ind or another.

Eric Clapton, the blues guitarist
who has done so much to reshape the
face of modern rock and roll, is a
‘oumeyman in each sense of the
‘World. His theory of blues guitar
and his creativity in using that theory,
along with his nearly twenty-ﬁve year

lgong musical career, guarantee that .11

title. The album Journeyman, his
best in ﬁve years, carries on the
Clapton tradition of blues—oriented

rock, returning to the guitar basics 5

found in Clapton hallmarks such as
;‘Cocaine,” “Layla,” and “Sunshine
Of Your Love” while for the most
part successfully integrating the syn-
thesized music of modern rock.

Apart from original guitar work
‘on Roger Waters’ 1984 album The
Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking and
the film scores for Lethal Weapon
and Lethal Weapon 1], Clapton’s
music seemed to have lost some of
its original fire and blues in his al-
bums Behind The Sun and August as
he moved into heavily synthesizer-
driented rock, using his guitar as little
more that a backup piece. One of
the reasons for that change was Phil
(Collins, who co-produced Behind The
Sun in 1985 and produced the 1986
August.
v. While these albums provided Top
40 hits like “It’s In The Way That
You Use It," “Forever Man,” and
‘(Miss You,” Clapton’s guitar seemed
drowned out at times by drum
fnachines and keyboards. On Jour-
aeyman, Collins is where he belongs,
behind a drum set, while producer
Russ Titelman lets Clapton’s guitar
t ke center stage.

Journeyman has an astonishingly

   

.W&LlFE

wide variety of songs, from the gos-
pel-like “Running On Faith” to the
blues-club sound of “Hard Times” to
the radio-oriented “No Alibis" and
“Pretending.” Clapton, while stead-
fastly playing blues guitar, has proven
able to adapt several different types
of music to his playing style, another
way of saying that Clapton is versa-
tile in what he can play. Yes, there
are drum machines and keyboards,
but Clapton’s guitarwork is the cen-
terpiece around which the rest of the
album is built.

“Pretending,” the first single off
the album, is a hard—hitting combina-
tion of blues "wah" guitar, keyboards

Journeyman: Clapton’s best in five years

and drum machine.

“Bad Love” features Phil Collins
on drums and backup vocals with
Clapton playing at least two different
styles of guitar with help from guitar-
ist Phil Palmer.

“Running On Faith” returns to
the old slide acoustic guitar featured
on classics like “Let It Grow” and
found elsewhere only recently on his
Roger Waters work.

“Hound Dog,” the Elvis Presley
hit written in 1956, has blues guitarist
Robert Cray playing off on Clapton’s
own guitar, creating a modern, play-
ful version of this rock classic.

The romantically haunting “Lead

{ERIC CLAPTON-JOURNEYMAN 

   
 

Me On” echoes somewhat the man’s

most romantic work, ‘ ‘Wonderful
Tonight’ ’ from the 1977 album
S Iowhand. ‘

“Before You Accuse Me” gives
Clapton and Cray a chance to play
serious blues with accompanying
piano, organ-like synthesizer and hard
stomping drums.

Clapton also has such talents as
George Harrison, Daryl Hall, Chaka
Khan and the Reverend Timothy
Wright Washington Temple Concert
Choir lending musical assistance as
well as backup and harmonizing
vocals.

Critics of Journeyman will point

out that Clapton has co—written only
two out of twelve songs on the al-
bum. This, however, helps to justify
Clapton’s new title of journeyman.
Lately, especially with the release of
his compilation work Crossroads, he
has been said to be at a musical
crossroads in his career, with many
different avenues to choose from, and
here he takes advantage of those
choices.

Clapton has picked a variety of
songs written for the most part in the
mid-80's, but also many from the
past. “Hard Times" was written by
none other than Ray Charles in 1961,
and “Hound Dog” and “Before You

Accuse Me” were originally written
in 1956 and ’57, respectively.

Clapton has applied his skill as a
musical journeyman to several differ-
ent songs from several different peri-
ods in rock, making them unique
with his own blues—oriented style in
today’s world of techno-pop rock.

While Journeyman is not a classic
such as Slowhand and at best recalls
parts of Eric Clapton’s rock classics
from Cream, Blind Faith and his own
earlier solo career without recreating
them, it is a soulful and creative step
in the right direction for the man
internationally known as the Best
Guitarist in Rock.

Custis Society

is open

By Alisann McGloln
Staff Reporter

Two women’s groups, one old
and one new, are working to provide
non-sorority activites for Washington
and Lee women.

A new social organization at
Washington and Lee, the Custis Soci-
ety, is open to all women, not just
sorority members, according to the
group’s president.

“The eating club was conceived
to be purely social," said Mary
Hampson.

The society, which was modeled
after Princeton University's eating
clubs, was set up for the sole purpose
of meeting girls and eating, Hampson
said.

This goal should be achieved on
Wednesday, February 28th, when the
Custis Society sponsors an ice cream
social. "Sundaes, Sundaes, Sundaes!"
will welcome all W&L women- greek
or non-greek. Hampson also said a
dinner following break is in the
works.

Although Hampson and other
W&L women were against bringing
sororities to Washington and Lee, her
attitude now, even with her own
choice of non-affiliation, is one of

“I think there is a lot of enjoy-
ment in being independent. I person-
ally think the sorority issue is no
longer present. They're here and we
should welcome them,” she said.

While the eating club was started
last year at about the same time
sororities began their colonization,
Trident was a functioning women’s
organization long before sororities
colonized.

A committee of about six women,
some affiliated and some not, is
working to make “Confetti’s,” that
group’s major social event, a reality
again this year.

Alicia Haye, working in conjunc-
tion with Dean Ann Schroer-Lamont,
is hoping to receive some money
from the Executive Committee for a
budget to plan the activities. The cost
of the weekend itself should be cov-
ered by ticket sales, Haye said.

The committee is aiming at May

Junior forward Craig Hatfield was
lying on the ground under the basket,
ﬂat on his back, with his hands over
his face.

That's all anyone really needed to
see to get the story of the Washing-
ton and Lee-Roanoke basketball game
last Saturday night in Salem, Va.
W&L had come back from a 22-
point second half deficit to lead by
one point late only to lose 86-83.

In the first half, W&L shot just
29 percent to Roanoke’s 63 percent.
Roanoke led 48-27 at the half.

Said W&L head coach Verne
Canfield of the team's first half per-
formance, “It is just totally inexcus-
able for a team to stand around for
an entire half, and that's what we
did, we stood around for an entire
half. We can‘t beat anyone by play-
ing just one half of basketball."

In the second half, the Generals
received a wake-up call and came out
playing like gangbusters. After Betts
converted a three-point play with
19:19 to play, and Larry Rose was
called for a technical foul (grabbing
the rim without the ball) with 19:04
to go, W&L went to work down 51-
29.

Hatﬁeld went to work on the
boards and inside on 6-8- Derek Otten
for nine points in the next four min-
utes, and when junior forward Ed
Hart, seeing his first action since Jan.
5, followed a Hatfield miss at the
14:00 mark, the Generals had com-
pleted a 15-0 run to cut the lead to
seven at 51-44.

Pendleton then scored six of the
next 10 Roanoke points to put the
lead back at 11, 61-50 with 9:27 to
play, and Roanoke had weathered the
first W&L run.

Then Pat Gallavan exploded from
three point land for W&L. The 6-4
junior hit two and Holton one to
bring the lead down to 63-59 with

7:54 to go. At this point tempers
ﬂared, and junior point guard Jim
Casey was ejected for hitting Pend-
leton with the ball from across the
court after things had calmed down.

Roanoke hit three free throws and
got a basket by Lineburg for a five-
point play. Gallavan answered for the
Generals with another three point
basket from 23-feet out to cut the
lead to 68-62.

Two straight baskets by Hart cut
the lead to four at 70-66 with 6:25 to
go, but Roanoke extended the lead
back to 76-68 on a basket by Rose.
After a basket by junior center Chris
Jacobs, Gallavan loaded his three-
point gun one more time.

A bomb with 3:30 to go brought
the Generals within three, and an old-
fasliioned three-point play seconds
later tied the game at 76, and W&L
had erased a 22-point deficit.

Roanoke led 82-79 after a basket
by Betts, but Hatﬁeld hit two foul
shots to make it 82-81, and when
Hart tipped in a miss 30 seconds
later, W&L led 83-82 with 1:16 to
go.

Junior center Chris Jacobs rriissed
the front end of a one-and-one that
could have extended the lead to three,
and Pendleton was fouled as he
leaned into Holton with 20 seconds
left, and gave Roanoke the lead with
two free throws. Without using a
time out, the Generals managed to
get a shot opportunity for Jacobs, but
his short hook-shot rolled off, Betts
was fouled with five seconds left.

Betts converted both, and junior
captain Mike Holton’s 35-foot prayer
was not answered. His shot hit the
backboard, the front rim and fell of,
and with that Hatﬁeld fell to the
floor.

For the night, Gallavan led all
scorers with a career high 25 points,
including five of five from three
point range in the second half. Hat-
field had l7 points and 12 rebounds.
Hart scored nine points and grabbed
four rebounds in his first game back

The Ring-tum Phl, February 15, 1990

in 12 rriinutes.

Said Carifield, “If we play two
halves like we are capable of playing,
there is absolutely no one in the
conference who can beat us. Even in
the second half we didn't play like
we are totally capable of playing. We
got some people hot and we started
playing defense.

“The guys get credit from coming
back from 21 points down. That’s
tough to do, but we shouldn’t have
been 21 points down in the first
place.” ,

On Tuesday, Hart proved he was
back to stay in the final regular-sea-
son ODAC game for the Generals.

Coming off the bench, Hart took
the Generals from 6-5 down to 15-6
up by starting a 10-0 run that span-
ned two minutes with six straight
points.

The Royals responded with an 8-
2 run of their own sparked by
Vaughn Troyer’s six straight points,
but the Generals answered with a 13-
3 run to lead 30-17, capped by Hart's
stick-back on Gallavan’s missed free
throw. At the half, W&L led 37-26
behind 14 points from Hart and seven
from Jacobs.

When Jacobs scored with 19:05 to
play, W&L had it’s» biggest lead of
the night at 40-26. From there the
Royals started to work their way
back into the game.

Said Hart, “For the first half of
the game, we were controlling things.
We were working our offense through
and playing tough defense. And then
we just started to stand and let them
do what they wanted.”

Eastern Mennonite closed to 54-
49 with 9:43 to play on a three-point
play from John Leonard. With 9:01
to play, Casey extended the lead back
to 58-50 for the Generals, but the
Royals would not go away.

When Troyer scored with 5:44 to
play, Eastern Mennonite led 64-60.
They led 72-67 when Jeff Gingerich
made two free throws with 2:19 to
play.

Wrestling season closes

By John Neumann
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team ended its 2-3 season with a 30-
18 loss to a tough Longwood College
team Wednesday night in Doremus
Gymnasium.

The Generals jumped out to an
early 6-0 lead as freshman Rich Paini
needed just 40 seconds to record a
118-pound pin. Paini ended his first
season with a very respectable 7-4
mark.

But from that point, Longwood
asserted itself, claiming four of the
next ﬁve matches.

Junior co-captain Larry Pilkey, 13-
11, could not overcome Sean House,
losing to him 11-6, in the 126-pound
b0uL

Freshman Doug Lamb finished his
year with a 3-9 mark as he dropped
an 8-0 decision.

Senior co-captain Lee Garlove,
wrestling at 142, improved his record
to 441 winning by forfeit propelling
the Generals to a 12-7 lead.

Freshman Cary Potts, 2-12 on the
season, fought a tough 6:26, before
being pinned at 150-pounds.

Freshman Ryland Scott lost a 10-
4 decision as the Generals fell behind
16-12. This year, Scott is 6-12-1 at
158 pounds.

Sophomore Peer Soderberg, 12-9,

 

Clalre Dudley

 

oppogotQQo*“

won his 167 pound match by forfeit.

With the Generals ahead 18-16,
Bill Avery, 0-3, could not fight off
his 177-pound opponent and lasted
2:38 before being pinned.

Freshman Andrew Tucker, 0-7,
wrestled up a weight class to 190-
pounds and was overpowered. He
held on for 3:42 before being beaten
by technical fall, thereby securing the
match for Longwood.

Freshman heavyweight John Conk-
ling dropped an emotional 10-7 deci-
sion and finished the year 2-13
against stiff competition.

Head coach Gary Franke called
the match “a nice performance,” but
was disappointed a few more individ-
uals couldn't have turned their deci-
sion around.

The team season is over but four
wrestlers will continue on and com-
pete at the NCAA Division III East-
ern Regionals at Gallaudet College in
Washington D.C.

Pilkey, Garlove, Scott, and Soder-
berg will represent W&L.

Although any wrestler could have
participated, Franke sent four of his
top season performers.

This past weekend, W&L com-
peted in the Virginia College Division
Championships. While only placing
fifth in as many teams, the Generals
had some strong individual perform-
ances.

Pilkey and Soderberg both wres-
tled their way to the finals before
falling. Conkling finished third in the
heavyweight division and Scott grab-
bed fourth at 158.

Franke said he was, “encouraged
with some youngsters even though it
didn't help the team performance."
Virginia State won the championship

followed by Longwood, Newport 
News Apprentice, Norfolk State, and -

W&L.

In the 126-final, Pilkey could not it

overcome his Longwood nemesis,
Sean House, losing by a tough 8-6
score. Franke commented, “I
thought Pilkey did a real nice job and
Peer wrestled well to get to the fi-
nals. All in all, it was about as ex-

pected. We had a chance to do a»

little better, but I was pleased with
our performance.”

Looking back on the tearn’s sea-
son, Franke will remember the 1989-
90 season as an inexperienced club
loaded with freshmen who gained
valuable experience.

Said Franke, “We learned a lot
and gained experience through
matches and gained a lot of technical
experience. Hopefully it will benefit
them later.”

Florida frosh continue to shine in defeat

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee women's
swimming team is enjoying a well-
deserved ten-day break from competi-
tion.

W&L finished strongly against
Mary Washington last Saturday, with
the opponent scoring a victory of just
twelve points. According to head
coach Page Remillard, even such a
small difference as twelve points
obscures the truth about W&L’s
performance.

“I don’t think I've ever seen a

closer meet,” said Remillard. “For
example, there were two ties, and
some of our times were fewer than
seven one-hundredths of a second
apart from Mary Washington’s. The
twelve-point win looks like a blow-
out compared to what happened.”

Four W&L women captured first
place times. Junior Sharon Coleman
and sophomore Jodi Herring finished
first in the 100-butterﬂy and 1650-
freestyle events, respectively.

Florida freshman Claire Dudley
and Stephanie Sauers continue to
bring sunshine into Remillard’s life.
Each finished with two victories
apiece. Dudley placed first in the

200-freestyle and 100-breaststroke
events, and Sauers won both the 50-
and 100-freestyle races.

Remillard was quick to praise
these four women, but he also com-
mented on the efforts of two other
swimmers, junior Rachelle Nock and
senior Kris Amoroso.

Nock turned in excellent swims
and that Amoroso has exhibited the
best races of her four years.

“Kris is coming into form and
has a chance to go to the Nationals.
She has created heightened optimism
about her potential to qualify in the
400 medley relay — that's our goal.

Swimmers

crawl past

Mary Washington by
their swimming caps

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee men’s
swimming team won its final dual
meet of the season by defeating Mary
Washington College, 101-98, on
Saturday.

“Our men swam well,” said head
coach Page Remillard. “I'm very
pleased with our effort. I think we’re
right where we want to be.”

The men recorded their sixth
straight victory over the Eagles as
Saturday's narrow victory in on the
road pushed the Generals’ season
record to 8-5.

“They (the men) have done a
really good job to finish the dual
meet season at 8-5 with only eight
guys,” said Remillard.

Saturday’s win was “a team ef-
fort. There was not really a key
swim,” Remillard said, although he
noted that W&L’s victory in the 400-
yard freestyle relay provided the
three-point margin of victory. The
relay team, composed of sophomores
Jay Smith, Doug Brown, Chip Nord-
hoff and junior Jim Dunleavy, won
the event by ﬁnishing with a time of
3:18.17

Individually, Smith and Nordhoff
each registered to double victories.

Smith’s unbeaten streak now
stands at 24 after winning the 50-
and 100—yard freestyle events (21.83
and 48.45, respectively).

Nordhoff finished the 200-yard
freestyle in 1:48.89 and won the 200-
yard backstroke with a time of
2:06.31.

Also earning ﬁrst-place points for
the Generals were Dunleavy in the
1,650-yard freestyle event (17:17.03),
sophomore Stuart Towns in the 200-
yard individual medley (2:04.11) and
Brown in the 500-yard freestyle
(4:56.35).

)‘()1

The remainder of the Generals’
points were gained through second-
place finishes.

Brown placed second in the 200-
yard freestyle with a time of 1:49.20,
Towns in the 200-yard backstroke
(2:08.06), Dunleavy in the 500-yard
freestyle (5:02.34) and freshman
Andrew Pearson in the 100-yard
freestyle (50.62).

“It (the meet) was a numbers
game,” Remillard said. “They (Mary
Washington) picked up the points that
were lingering out there,” indicating
that the Eagles collected points in
each event they entered.

“We ran the best lineup we could
and fortunately we were successful,”
Remillard added.

The Generals will compete in the
Atlantic States Conference champion-
ships at Hollins College next week-
end. W&L is the two-time defending
champions of the Atlantic States, but
Remillard said that the team’s lack of
depth will hurt its chances for anoth-
er championship this season.

“It would be incredible if we
could win,” said Remillard said.
“But it will be depth that brings in
the points.”

Mary Washington, Radford and
UNC-Charlotte will also swim in the
championships.

“The whole year we’ve been
planning for these three days. The
goal is to swim faster than you ever
have in your life (in order to qualify
for the national championships),”
Remillard said.

“We’ve been working hard for
several months and we’re swimming
fatigued,” Remillard continued.
“Now we’ll get some good rest to
feel stronger and gain a physiological
beneﬁt.

“We’re after some school records
and qualifying times. We’re not done
yet.”

From W&L Sports Information

The Washington and Lee
women's track team set two
school records and the men’s
team continued to improve their
times in preparation for the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Championships as the two squads
competed at the Virginia Tech
All-Comers Meet on Saturday.

Senior co-captain Beth Stutz-
marm set a new mark of 8.86
seconds in the 55-meter hurdles,
and junior Laura Dodge estab-
lished a new W&L record for the
3,000 meters with a time of

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

 

12:05.

The men also got some strong
performances, most notable were
junior Carl Gilbert with a 51.7 in
the 400 meters and, senior Wes
Boyd with a personal best of 6.33
in the 60 meters and the mile
relay team of Boyd, Gilbert, se-
nior Scott Williams and freshman
David Phillips, which lowered its
time to 3231.5.

The men now have a weekend
off as they begin preparations for
the ODAC Indoor Championships
at Lynchburg on Feb. 24. The
Generals will be shooting for their
seventh consecutive indoor title.

Hart wasted little time in remind-
ing everyone how valuable his pres-
ence is on the court. When he en-
tered the game at the beginning of
the second half, the team seemed to
step their level of play up two
notches. Certainly no coincidence that
it happened when Hart returned to
action.

The team had been playing like it
was missing an important link in its
chain, and Hart returned to solidify
that chain just in time for the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference next
week. Hart scored a season-high 22
points in Tuesday’s win over Eastern
Mennonite on eight-of-twelve shoot-
ing. Not bad for someone who hasn't
seen game action for six weeks.

The numbers also show how
important Hart is to the team. Here is

Hart then scored six of his season-
high 22 in the overtime while taking
a charge and picking up a loose ball
to lead the Generals to an 85-80 win.
In the overtime, the Generals hit nine
of 12 free throws to secure the win.

Jacobs added 20 points for the
Generals, who improved to 14-10 and
more importantly 8-8 in the confer-
ence. It was W&L’s first ODAC
win since Jan. 16, against the same
Eastern Mennonite team.

Last Thursday night W&L closed
out its home season with an 84-69
win over Mary Washington.

The Generals never trailed as they
jumped out to a 13-2 lead sparked by
ﬁve points each from Jacobs and
Gallavan. W&L led 34-22 before
Mary Washington went on an 114
run to close the halftime deﬁcit to
38-33 behind five points from Billy
Sigler.

The most exciting moment of the
first half came with 8:20 to go when
sophomore Courtney Penn got ahead
of the pack and brought down the

house with his first college dunk to
give W&L a 25-14 lead.

In the second half, Mary Washing-
ton got as close as 49-45, but W&L
pulled away for the win. Jacobs led
all scorers with 23 points and 12
rebounds and classmate Scotr Alrutz
contributed without scoring. He grab-
bed seven rebounds, handed out four
assists and made two steals coming
off the bench.

Said Hart, “I know that we’re not
playing great right now, but it seems
that this season is kind of the reverse
of the last few. In the past, we’ve
fallen apart in February and this year
it happened a month earlier. Maybe
we’re starting to peak now going into
the [ODAC] toumament."

The tournament will start next
Tuesday night. The site and opponent
is still to be determined. Any tie will
be broken by the ODAC tiebrcaker
system, which awards points for wins

over each team, with the higher seed-

ed teams worth the highest amount of
points.

Experience Driving Miss Daisy

By Todd Peppers
Entertainment Columnist

Driving Miss Daisy is a
bittersweet tale that managed to
quickly capture my cynical heart. It
is the story of an elderly southern
Jewish lady, played by the mag-
niﬁcent Jessica Tandy, who plants her
1948 Hudson into a neighbor’s gar-
den. After the near—disaster her son
Boolie (Dan Aykroyd in a nicely
understated performance) demands
that she give up driving and hire a
chauffeur. When Miss Daisy refuses
Boolie himself hires a black man
named Hoke (Morgan Freedman) to
drive for his mother.

Hoke is a unpretentious, patient
man who finally convinces Miss
Daisy to tum over the steering wheel.
But Miss Daisy’s small defeat doesn’t
end her ability to control the situa-
tion: she perches herself in the back
of the car and--when not scrutinizing
the speedometer--offers Hoke her
barbed opinions on life; he often
counters with simple words that paint
a more authentic picture of their
world.

The story begins in Georgia in the
early l950’s and ends almost twenty
years later, although the upheaval and
violence that burned across the land
does not play a central role in the
film. Instead those changes are
reflected in the evolving relationship,
and eventual friendship, between Miss
Daisy and Hoke.

Miss Daisy considers her black
servants as children who are always
taking things. When son Boolie ad-
monishes his mother about her at-
titude toward Hoke, she declares:
"l’ve never been prejudiced Boolie,
and you know it." Yet Miss Daisy’s
actions toward her chauffeur and
housekeeper betray her true nature.

The subtle brilliance of the
screenplay, written by playwright
Alfred Uhry from his stage version of
Driving Miss Daisy, springs from the
fact that Miss Daisy is as much a
victim of senseless prejudice and
ignorance as Hoke. For example:
late in the film Miss Daisy and Hoke
leam that her synagogue has been
bombed. During the drive home
Hoke recalls the childhood memory
of seeing his neighbor being lynched.
Miss Daisy’s irritably tells Hoke that
his story has nothing to do with the
bombing of the temple; the old
women fights the notion that she and

Hoke could be equals in their fight
against mindless bigotry.

I was fascinated by the ease in
which Tandy and Freeman slipped on
their personas. Granted the charac-
ters are skillfully created by
playwright Uhry, but Tandy and
Freeman breath life into Miss Daisy
and Hoke. Tandy has a more thank-
less task: she portrays a sharp—ton-
gued and narrowed minded widow
who verbally abuses Hoke through
most of the film.

My first inclination was to find
amusement in the opinionated and
biting comments of Miss Daisy, but
underlying my laughter was a vague
uneasiness--I was finding humor in
her unadmirable character flaws. Yet
I came to honestly admire Miss
Daisy because she has the inner
strength to change as the civil rights
movement swirls around her.

But it is Freeman that carries the
film on his shoulders. He is ab-
solutely convincing as the simple but
digniﬁed chauffeur who is unafraid
take a stand for his beliefs. Miss
Daisy initially treats Hoke as if he
were a second—class citizen, but he
points out with devastating humility
that he is (1 man and will be treated
accordingly. His remarks trigger the
turning point of Miss Daisy’s emo-
tional growth: slie slowly ceases to
regard Hoke as "one of them" and
instead treats him as a human being.

This growth culminates in one of
the film’s final scenes when Hoke
comforts the elderly and confused
Miss Daisy. She stares up at him
with frightened eyes and tells Hoke
that "you’re the best friend I've got."
They quietly join hands and nothing
more is said. Forever banished is the
formalized relationship between a
wealthy white southemer and her
black chauffeur, it is replaced with a
pure and tender friendship.

The underlying theme in Driving
Miss Daisy springs from the words of
Martin Luther King. Miss Daisy
attends a benefit dinner for King.
She has an extra ticket, but cannot
overcome her prejudice and leaves
Hoke outside with the car. Miss
Daisy listens to King want his
audience not to fear the evil of those
consumed with racial hatred, but
instead those who are ﬁlled with
apathy toward the plight of the
blacks. Awareness and remorse
slowly fill Miss Daisy’s eyes as she
stares at the vacant seat to her right.
By the film’s end she has, in her

own small way, banished the apathy
in her soul.

Driving Miss Daisy is, on one
level, a humorous and handsomely-
filmed production; yet it delivers a
powerful testimony to the value of
friendship and the rlestructiveness of
racial and religious intolerance.

ii.

Peppers will grade Driving Miss
Daisy a solid "A"--I consider it equal
vvllh the likes of When Hgzrry Met
Sally and Born of the Fourth of July.
The film is currently showing at the
State Theater, and I, urge you to
experience Driving Miss Daisy before
it leaves town.

car tax effort

List of owners requested

By Genienne Mongno

 Associate Editor

Lexington City Manager Joseph
King has asked Washington and Lee
President John Wilson to provide the
city with a list of all vehicles kept by
students living in Lexington,
continuing the city’s efforts to collect
a personal property tax on some
student cars.

Although W&L is not required by
law to provide the information, “it
would save us a lot of effort and
work,” said Commissioner of Reve-
nue Courtney Baker. Baker said she
has not yet recieved a response.

According to W&L Vice President
John Elrod, “We have taken it under
consideration, and at this point we
have made no decision about what
we are going to do with that re-

King said the information was needed
to “assure compliance" with Virginia
Code Section 58.1. That statute says
the City Council can tax as personal’
property motor vehicles “normally
garaged or parked” within the city
limits. '

Out-of-state students can be ex-
empted from the tax “upon showing
of sufﬁcient evidence that such per-
son has paid a personal property tax
on the vehicle in the state in which
he is domiciled.”

Irt addition, the statute states that
if a personal property tax has been
paid in another jurisdiction within
Virginia, the taxpayer “may apply to
such county or city for a refund of
such payment.”

“Nobody will have to pay in two‘

places,” said Baker.
If she receives the information
from the schools, Baker said she

City action will delay Renassance start-up

_
By Chuck Broll
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee Fraternity
Renaissance has not moved forward as
expected because the Lexington Planning
Commission has failed to act on new zoning
proposals, said Associate D’ean"ofStu’£leiits
Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins.

Atkins told the members of the Inter-
fraternity Council Tuesday that Sigma Alpha
Epsilon will probably not begin reconstruc-
tion on April 1 as expected, but he was
“pretty sure” the ﬁve “Red Square” frater-
nities will begin June 1.

The university asked the eight-rncmber
commission on Feb. 15 to recommend to the
City Council its requests for an enlargement
of the “Institutional Zone" and uncondition-
al use permits to be granted for all of the
buildings. The two requests would make the
buildings and properties of the fraternities
part of the Washington and Lee campus.

Citizens and commission members were
skeptical of the requests due to their possi--
ble effect on taxes and future uses.

Capital Planning Coordinator Frank Par-
sons, speaking at the Feb. 15 meeting, said
that “W&L will enhance the revenue stream
due to the appreciation of the fraternity
house values after the renovation." In addi-

' tion, Parsons said, while W&L and Virginia

Military Institute do not have to pay taxes,
they do anyway to help the city.
Regarding the future uses of the fratemi-
ties, Parsons said W&L could do what it
wanted with the buildings and land if the
new zoning proposals are enacted. Now,
each time a change is tnade, the school's
Master Plan would have to be revised.
Every Master Plan revision must be
approved by a recommendation of the Plan-
ning Commission and a vote of approval by
the Lexington City Council, Parsons said.
Should fraternities cease to exist, the
houses would still be used as residences, he
said, giving examples of a “French language

house, a vegetarian house,” or some type of
academic residence.

Commission member Camille Miller
asked Parsons to have W&L guarantee the
future use of the residences through “legal
restrictions.” Miller said she feared the
buildings would be demolished in the future
in order for W&L to build new dormitories,
classrooms or other structures.

Miller said she believed the commission
was unanimously in favor of the Renais-
sance program, bu" if the city were to grant
the university’s r,-quests, W&L could then
do anything with the enlarged zone.

“I am doing what’s right for my chil-
dren and grandchildren,” Miller said.

The commission called for a public
meeting on the zoning issues tor March 15,
at which time the university will present its
ﬁnancial proposal to the city.

City Manager Joseph King said “City
Council will honor the decision -or the
Planning Commission” and could make its
decision the same day as the public meeting.

W&L to house most displaced students

By James Lake
Associate Editor

Washington and Lee will be able to house
at least 63 of the 72 students who applied for
campus housing during the fall phase of
W&L's Fraternity Renaissance and should be
able to ﬁnd space for the other nine as well,
Assistant Dean of Students Ken Ruscio said
Tuesday.

The school had reserved only 35 spots for
the approximately 110 students who will be
displaced by the closing of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta, Phi
Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma Nu
houses. Those spots are all in the Woods
Creek Apartments and Gaines Hall.

But Ruscio said additional vacancies in
Gaines and Woods Creek and the converting
of some single rooms into doubles would
provide 28 more spots. And he said he expects
to ﬁnd nine more beds on campus as well.

“I'm just fairly conﬁdent that we’ll be
able to ﬁnd nine places without going off-
campus,” he said. Ruscio declined to be
speciﬁc about where those spots tnight be, but
he did say some of the applicants now as-
signed to on—carnpus housing might decide to
live elsewhere.

“These assignments are all very tenta-
tive,” he said.

Ruscio said he was able to honor requests
for specific roommates and suitemates “pret-
ty well.” Speciﬁc assignments may be an-
nouced as soon as next week, Ruscio said.

Students Faculty retirements may bring personnel crisis

elect
Hatcher

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

The Executive Committee Big
Three run-offs culminated Thursday,
Feb. 15, in victory for Thompson
Hatcher, Raymond Welder and Jeffery
Kelsey. -

Hatcher defeated incumbent Wil-
lard Dumas for EC president with
680 votes to Dumas’ 577.

Hatcher expressed appreciation to
his supporters. “I’m going to do the
very best I can to be easily accessible
next year,” he said.

The seat of EC vice president
went to Welder, whose 735 votes
defeated John Fialcowitz’s 518, while
Kelsey claimed the post of secretary
with 655 votes to Caroline Wight’s
587.

The Voting Regulations Board
reported that 1,275 students voted.

“I was very pleased with the
undergraduate turnout,” said VRB
Chairman Wesley Goings. “It was
probably the most we’ve had in
years.”

At Monday night’s EC meeting,
Dumas congratulated the winners on
behalf of the student body and
thanked all the candidates for their
time.

Goings agreed with senior EC
Rep. John “Jack” Pringle that there
may be a need for more voting boxes
for Big Three elections. Pringle made
that statement at the EC meeting on
Feb. 12. '

The VRB has three boxes. In
undergraduate elections, they are
placed in the Baker-Davis—Gilliam
Quad, the ODK Circle, and outside
the University Library. However, in

Seven professors
face retirement rule

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

Seven senior faculty members will
be affected by Washington and Lee’s
mandatory retirement rule in the next
four years.

The rule says these professors
must retire no later than the end of
the academic year in which they turn
70, with no exceptions.

According to university President
John Wilson, all colleges and univer-
sities were granted a special dispensa-
tion allowing thetn to have mandatory
retirement rules, which are illegal for
other businesses, to create vacancies
for minority professors and women
professors.

Although the dispensation will
probably be revoked by Congress on
Jan. 1, 1993, according to W&L Vice
President and Dean of the College
John Elrod, the mandatory retirement
rule will still affect the seven profes-
sors whose 70th birthdays fall before
that day.

They are romances languages
Prof. C. Westbrook Barritt, joumalism

Prof. Clark Mollenhoff, accounting
Prof. Jay Cook Jr., chemistry Prof. J.
Keith Shillington, psychology Prof. H.
Eugene King, German Prof. Buford
Stephenson and Commerce School
Prof. Edward Atwood Jr. They have
divergent views on mandatory retire-
ment, ranging from acceptance to
indifference to displeasure.

King is retiring at the end of this
school year, three years before forced
retirement, and Shillington has been
in a gradual retirement program for
the last three years.

Atwood, Barritt and Cook said
mandatory retirement doesn‘t bother
them.

“I want to have’ time to spend my
pension!"said Atwood, who added
that he doesn’t know if he will teach
until he is 70.

“I’m ready to retire,” said Cook.
“I'm not going to make an issue out
of it. After the number of years I’ve
been teaching, I've got enough things
to keep me occupied.”

Barritt said, “I'm not retiring
early, but its also fair to let someone

ty people is going to be difficult.”
to university President John
Wilson, Washington and Lee has a higher
percentage of faculty in the 65-70 age group
than most schools. There are 47 current profes-
sors who will be at least 65 by the year 2000,
an age where they can retire with full pension
and social security benefits. At least 10 of them
have indicated plans to retire by the end of the
1990-1991 academic year. Elrod said the sci-
ences, languages and commerce departments
will probably have the toughest time ﬁnding
qualiﬁed people, because the number of doctor-
ate candidates is down nationwide. A doctorate

degree is a prerequisite for a professor at W&L
“99 percent” of the time, Elrod said.

However, many department heads, who are
in charge of conducting searches to ﬁnd new
professors, say that at this time they have no
problems ﬁnding qualiﬁed applicants.

“We are in the middle of a search at this
moment, and I’m very excited about the quality
of the candidates," said Prof. Hampden H.
Smith III, head of the journalism department.
“Washington and Lee’s reputation attracts very
impressive candidates, and the journalism
department has a very good reputation. We had
three applicants who didn't apply anywhere
else.”

Prof. J . Kevin Green, head of the accounting
department, expressed a feeling many of his
colleagues share. “I believe there is a constitu-
ency of good people who want to come to a
place like Washington and Lee,” he said.

Prof. Robert Strong, head of the politics
department, said, “We can see that there will
be fewer applicants than in the past, but I don’t
think it will be too big a problem. I would
guess, and these things are always a guess, that
we will have fewer applications but will be able
to ﬁll our needs.”

OPINION

EC business goes
behind closed doors

The Executive Committee shall not go into executive session
except in the case of possible honor violations. —- The
Washington and Lee Student Body Constitution, Article
V, Section P.

This sentence may come as a surprise to some EC
members, but it’s there nevertheless. It’s also probably news
to Fancy Dress Chairman Alex Hitz, who at the Feb. 12
EC meeting asked to give his budget report behind closed
doors.

To be fair to Hitz, it’s not his responsibility to enforce
the student body’s rules; it’s the EC’s. That’s why we were
surprised and disappointed to see the EC vote
overwhelmingly to go into executive session. The only
dissenters in the 10-3 vote were senior Rep. David
Radulovic, junior Rep. John Fialcowitz and President Willard
Dumas. There was no debate, no discussion; the EC simply
did it. After the meeting, none of the EC members we
contacted would explain the vote for the record.

The EC is answerable to no one but the student body.
Its members are bound only by their oaths of office, by
which they “do solemnly swear to support” the student
body constitution. Accordingly, when they go into executive
session, they are there for one reason only: to discuss
possible honor violations. Right?

Apparently not. Apparently, the 10 EC members who
voted to close the door aren’t too concerned about the
constitution. Apparently, they are more interested in doing
what they think is best than what the constitution says is
best.

We have been vocal supporters of the EC this year,
especially for its leadership in cleaning up financial problems
in the Student Activities Board. We do not enjoy criticizing
the same body that has performed so well in the past. But
that support lasts only as long as the EC acts in the best
interest of the student body. And, no matter what reason
Hitz offered, it could not possibly be more important than
the charter by which the EC was established.

We are especially troubled that junior Rep. Tom Hatcher,
the EC president-elect, was among those who voted for

closure. That same night, Hatcher was out campaigning for
a “more open” student government. He seemed to be out
to garner student support by using “More Openness!” as
a campaign slogan — disregarding facts he certainly should
have known about the current EC’s performance.

Until Feb. 12, we had seen no evidence of secrecy; in
fact, we had seen abundant evidence to the contrary. When
the EC investigated the SAB last fall, the Phi and the student
body were allowed to observe the entire process. Even
though the process was at times ugly, Dumas and the EC
remained committed to full openness. The EC seemed to
recognize that students have a right to know how their
student activities money is spent.

That right should not be limited by the EC’s whim, and
it should not change when a new president takes office.
We hope that the EC’s vote for closure two weeks ago was
its last. And we hope next year’s student body won’t have
the same concerns we do.

Bray was christened the first woman to command
a U.S. Army unit in combat. Since then, the exact
details of the incident have become muddled to the
point that it is unclear what happened when Bray’s
military-police platoon was instructed to secure a
Panamanian guard—dog kennel.

But the details of this one incident hold little

I importarice.,For Bray’s experience in no way sym-

bolizes‘ whether women have potential for success
in combat. The only significance in what did hap-
pen to Bray lies in how it has reopened the issue
of women in combat to public debate. And this
time there are signs that many Americans may be

allowed and expected on the
front lines.

Even the earliest media coverage of Bray’s
participation in combat in Panama made the event
out to be a milestone for women. Quotes from
those who worked with Bray reinforced the idea
that she served in Panama as a soldier, not as a
woman. In another time, the loudest voices we
heard would have been those decrying the idea of
a woman under fire; today, the loudest voices are
filled with pride at the idea of a woman serving
her country equally with men.

Since then, of course, both sides have presented
arguments, but those against women on the front
lines find themselves clinging to ﬂimsy premises.

[One retired brigadier general in North Carolina

argued in a recent newspaper column that many
tests have shown that women are not suited for
combat. Those against women in battle point to,

suggested.

The general continues with another excep3

nist argument that some women are stronger than
some men does not hold up, because wars are no?

qualiﬁcations? Women with those qualifications

may to a degree be exceptions to their gender. Bug
as soldiers, these women are as average as any.

The bottom line is that if we want true gender?

pected — to take their places on the front lines,’
just as they are taking their places in management

on the battlefield will probably never be female.

THE SBAR SIDE

In the interest of broadening the

a high-powered title like that I’ll be
taken seriously by campus scholars
who read untranslated Plato in their

According to scientists, who wear
white laboratory jackets and read
scientific journals, all humans require
sleep because those who are deprived
of it turn into ranting lunatics and
run around naked in the moonlight
looking for insects to eat and ripping
clumps of hair out of their heads.
These scientists are the same ones
who wanted to build a UFO Wel-
come Center in New York City, so
don't take them too seriously.

Dreaming, which is the purpose of
sleep, was discovered a couple of
weeks after the dawn of man by a
prehistoric man named Brickhead. All

I am writing in response to the numerous
large trees that were removed form the PiKA,
Phi Dell, and Beta quad over break. At first, I
thought that the trees were destroyed because of
possible interference with construction (i.e. —
bulldozers and other construction equipment
needed to be brought in to carry out the renova-
tions). I reluctantly accepted this reasoning,
although I know of many houses whose “mon-
umental” trees were spared the axe of progress
during the construction of the homes.

However, I recently discovered that these
trees were cut down for landscaping purposes.
These trees, which once provided shade and

of Brickhead’s friends (even his dog,
Cement) believed that only evil spirits
could see pictures during sleep and,
consequently, Brickhead was burned
at the stake the minute someone
invented fire. When the leader of the
tribe, himself, had a dream, he sacri-
ficed all of Brickheads old friends
(even Cement) to Ublarahaha, the god
of Justice and Sweet Revenge. A me-
morial fund was then established in
honor of Brickhead and each year the
prehistoric teen-ager who had the
most dreams received a scholarship
fund (too bad there weren't any col-
leges yet).

Although later cave men used to
talk a lot about dreams and even
draw pictures of the really good ones,
dreams weren't really taken seriously
until Freud. Freud believed that drea-
ming is the subconscious mind's
indirect way of telling the rest of the
person that he is really a demented
pervert. Freud then invented “psy-
cho—analysis” so that he could make
easy money interpreting humorous
dreams.

does this mean?

Dr. Freud (in a German accent):
HO HO HA HA! That’s very funny,
Fraulein. And these two zebras. Were
they male or female?

Patient: One was male and the
other female. The male had an ear-
ring in his nose.

Dr. Freud: HO HO HO HO! A

you wish that you were a man. In
scientific terms this means you have
“penis envy.”

Because I generally sleep a lot I
consider myself an authority on
dreams. I also consider myself to be
an expert on cooking because I eat a
lot, (who cares if the most complicat-
ed thing that I’ve ever cooked was

One man who does have strong
feelings is Mollenhoff.

“I think professors should go on
teaching beyond 70 if they are
healthy,” he said. “Mandatory retire-
ment is wasting the talent of elderly

people. I don't feel old and crotchety
yet. My age hasn’t kept me from
working hard, and I enjoy the stu-
dents too. If I had been teaching for
35 or 40 years, then I might be ready
to quit.

“If I get to the point where I
wake up and go ‘I don’t want to go
to school today,’ I’ll step down. I’ll
know when its time,” he added.

Mollenhoff said he has no desire

-‘to continue teaching full-time, but

would like to teach one semester a
year, perhaps ﬁlling in for professors
on a sabbatical. He would be willing
to take a pay cut to make room for
new professors, he added, because he
believes it is a good idea for the
university to take on new faculty.

The former Pulitzer Prize winner will
be a visiting lecturer at the University
of Wyoming in the fall of 1991.
Although he said he will have plenty
of engagements to keep him busy, he

said he would “like to stay around

Stephenson declined to comment
on his view of mandatory retire-
ment.President Wilson said he doesn't
think many professors will choose to
teach after 70, noting that they can
retire with full pension and social‘

security beneﬁts as early as 65.

Several professors whose 70th
birthdays fall soon after the mandato-
ry retirement rule is likely to be
repealed have already made their
retirement decisions.

Art History Prof. Gerard Doyon
and Associate Athletic Director Rich-
ard Miller are both retiring this year,
“I’m an artist,” said Doyon. “I
can’t wait to become a Sunday paint-
er all week.”

Mathmatics Prof. Henry Sharp Jr.

ling and politics Prof. Milton Colvin
are retiring at the end of the 1990-91
school year. “I will be 68 next sum-
mer," said Colvin. “I think it is
high time to step out.” ‘

Prof. William Watt, head of the
chemistry department, echoed Colvin.

think teachers should retire at 70.
They start to lose their energy before
then.”

Some professors are unsure if they
will elect to teach after 70.

“The question must be decided by
each individual,” said English Prof.
Severn Duvall. “I think at 70 it’s
about time to step aside. I don’t think
I want to teach past 70, but I would
be willing to do something part-time,
even without pay, if the university
needed it.”

Duvall said space for talented
young teachers could be limited if
teachers decide to continue after 70.
He said the university could take
steps to remove professors if that
became a problem, but emphasized
that he didn't believe Washington and
Lee would use such tactics.

Prof. Edwin Craun, head of the
English department, said that while
there is a surplus of potential English
professors and Washington and Lee is
a very attractive place to work, the
heavy load of teaching seven courses
a year discourages some candidates
from coming to Washington and Lee.

“The greatest problem is the
number of courses people have to
teach,” he said. “Almost all appli-
cants mentioned course load as a

honor code, the role of Washington

ers, appreciating the character of the
student body and molding that char-
acter to the aims of liberal educa-

Gunn is one of a growing number
of professors participating in a pro-
gram that eases the transition from
full-time teaching to retirement for
the professor and the university.

It is called phased retirement. A

From News Releases

Lionel Hampton, an established
jazz superstar around the world, and
his 17—member Big Band will per-
form in Lexington as part of the
Rockbridge Concert-Theater Series.

For more than half a century,
Hampton has helped create musical
history as a composer, conductor and
entertainer.

In 1930, Hampton had a chance
meeting with jazz great Louis Arm-
strong. He ended up playing the
vibes for Armstrong - the first time
jazz had been played on the instru-
ment. This spurred Hampton's interest
in the vibes and inspired him to form
his own band in 1934.

Harnpton’s band travelled through-
out California, until in 1936 they met
Benny Goodman at The Paradise
Club. This meeting was the beginn-
ing of the swing era. It was also the
first time blacks and whites played
together in a major musical group.

Hampton left Goodman in 1940
and calls the period following this the
most significant in American popular
music.

“It was a melting pot of music,”
Hampton declares. “Unbeknownst to
us, we were playing the chords that
are now considered modern.”

Since Hampton left Goodman, he
has been travelling the roads with his
own band.

The jazz great’s music contribu-
tions to the world have already be-
come legendary. He has a host of

 Jazz great performs at VMI

awards and honors. In 1984, he was
nominated for a Grammy in the cate-
gory of “Best Rock Instrumental
Performance” for “Vibramatic.” He
also received a Grammy nomination
in 1985 for his album “Ambassador
at Large" in the “Performance by a
Big Band” category.

Also in 1985, Hampton was ap-

pointed the official “Ambassador of
Music" to the United Nations.
Hampton will perform at Jackson
Memorial Hall at Virginia Military
Institute on March 4 at 8 p.m.

Tickets are $12 for adults and $5
for students. They are available at
the door and at Quality Quick Print.

Aaron Copland’s Pulitzer Prize-
winning suite ital Appalachian
Spring will be the featured work in
a concert by the University-Rock-
bridge Symphony Orchestra Satur-
day at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Appalachian Spring, Copland’s
most popular work for orchestra, will
be performed in its original 1944
chamber orchestra version. The or-
chestra will also perform Ottorino
Respighi’s lute transcriptions of 16th
and 17th century Ancient Airs and
Dances [Suite No. 2], written in
1923. An Italian nationalist, Respighi
has preserved part of his country’s
rich musical heritage with this suite
of rustic dances and beautiful arias
artfully arranged for strings, wood-
winds, brass, percussion, harp and
harpsichord.

The concert will open with Sym-
phony No. 5 by William Boyce, one
of England’s most talented 18th cen-
tury composers.

The relatively unknown work
Overture ort Hebrew Themes by the
Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev,
will also be perforrrred. Originally
written for an ensemble that special-
ized in the performance of Jewish
music, the work contains two con-
trasting Hebrew tunes, one a toe-
tapping dance and the other a plain-
tive, moumful melody.

The University-Rockbridge Sym-
phony Orchestra, conducted by Barry
H. Kolman, is composed of university
students, community residents and
area professional musicians.

The concert is jointly sponsored
by Fine Arts In Rockbridge and the
department of music at W&L.

From W&L Sports Information

Four all-conference players, two

7 Division III All-Americans and a

national champion return to the
Washington and Lee men's tennis
roster this spring, but you won't ﬁnd
head coach Gary Franke gloating.

7 Despite all the returning talent,
Franke, whose squad opens its 1990
season March 2 at home against

,_ traditional early-season rival Penn

State, knows it will be an uphill
climb for his team to repeat the suc-
cess of recent years.

W&L has been to the NCAA
Division III Tournament ﬁve consecu-
tive years since 1985, placing second
twice, winning the national title in
1988 and finishing ﬁfth at last year's
championships. With national champi-
onship veterans Robert Haley and
Bobby Matthews gone to graduation,
Franke is taking a wait-and—see ap-
proach to 1990.

The Generals, depleted by gradua-
tion though they are, still have the
respect of their peers. W&L is ranked

' seventh in the nation in the preseason
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Asso-
ciation poll.

The four returning starters from
last year's No. 5 team in the nation
is one reason for this year’s favorable

, rating. Another reason lies in the fact
that one of those returning veterans

‘ just happens to be the best Division

III tennis player in the land.

John Morris, W&L’s senior No. 1
player and a three—time All-American,
begins the 1990 campaign the same
1 way he ended his 1989 season: as the

No. 1-ranked player in Division III.

Morris ﬁnished 1989 by winning 20

«it

t

straight matches and the national
singles championship, becoming the
ﬁrst W&L player to win the national
title. And Morris did it impressive
fashion, too, winning all six of his
matches in straight sets.

Morris, 26-9 _a year ago, appears
to be in good shape again this year.
The senior had a good fall season,
including a semiﬁnal ﬁnish at the No.
1 Flight at the James Madison Fall
Classic and a victory at No. 1 singles
at the W&L Fall Classic. He became
the ﬁrst W&L player to win any
singles title at the annual W&L fall
event.

Morris will be a key to W&L’s’
success this season, for sure, but he"’

will need plenty of help if the Gener-
als are going to make trip No. 6 to
the national tournament.

“John's been a great player for
us, and I'm hoping he can have the
same success this year that he had
last year,” said Franke, who is in his
12th season as director of the Gener-
als' tennis program. “Hopefully, John
will be able to raise everybody else’s

level, too."

Morris will be surrounded by a
less-experienced group than last year,
but it is a group not without its share
of laurels. Jurtior Bill Meadows has
won Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence singles arid doubles champion-
ships in each of his ﬁrst two seasons
at W&L. Meadows is the most expe-
rienced retumee, and he should get
the call at No. 2 singles after starting
at No. 6 as a freshman and then
moving to No. 4 last year.

Meadows will team with Morris,
who also collected the national dou-
bles championship last year, too, to

The Ring-tum Phi, March 1, 1990

U.Va. foils Stagnitta debut

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

At first glance, the 1990 version
of the Washington and Lee men’s
lacrosse team strongly resembles the
1989 unit. But that is only at first
glance.

Yes, 23 lettermen, including seven
starters, return from last year's squad,
which ﬁnished 4-9. But the coach is
new, and the attitude is new as well.

Jim Stagnitta, in his first year as
head coach, likes what he sees after
his ﬁrst pre—season. “I think they're
excited and they're confident," he
said of his players. “I think they're
starting to understand the system, and
they see how the system has worked.
They really think they can do well.”

As well they should. After beat-
ing Georgetown in one preseason
scrimmage, the team hung tough with
Division I powers North Carolina and
Penn, where Stagnitta was an all-Ivy
League defenseman and later assistant
coach.

“I think with the scrimmages
against Penn and North Carolina and
the season-opener with Virginia, we
will have faced three of the top Div-
ision I programs in the nation," said
Stagnitta. “When we get to the Div-
ision HI schedule, it will be like a
breath of fresh air. I think we'll be
ready.”

Leading the way for the Generals
will be the defense, bolstered by the
return of two-time All-America Reid
Campbell and junior goaltender Tom
Costello. Campbell, a four-year start-
er, will look to become the first four-
time all conference defenseman in
Old Dominion Athletic Conference

Morris will lead netters again

form W&L’s No. 1 doubles tandem.
This fall, the pair finished third at
JMU and then reached the No. 1
finals at the W&L Fall Classic.

Behind Meadows are senior Billy
Turmer and junior Reid Manley, who
will man the No. 3 and No. 4 slots,
respectively. Both Tunner (No. 6 last
year) and Manley (No. 5 last year)
won ODAC singles titles last spring.
The two then teamed together at the
ODAC Championships for the first
time all season and walked away with
the No. 3 doubles championship.

The early word on the rest of the
starting lineup for 1990 has sopho-
mores Jack Tinney and Kelly Vand-
ever ﬁlling in the No. 5 and 6 sin-
gles slots. While the two will be
competing intercollegiately for the
first time this spring, both got some
crucial experience during the fall
matches at W&L and James Madison.

Again Franke has dotted his
schedule with an assortment of beefy
Division III opponents and others
from across the tennis spectrum. The
Generals have a crucial back-to-back
mid-season tests when they travel to
play national finalist Swarthrnore and
pre—season No. 3 Washington College
on the last day of March and ﬁrst
day of April.

W&L also will make its annual
mid-April trek to Florida to take on
a murderers’ row of opponents from
the Sunshine State, including Division
II giant Rollins and NAIA powers
North Florida and Florida Institute of
Technology.

So, W&L will face the same
challenges it has had to face for the
last several years. In addition to their
national struggle, W&L will look to

history.

Joining Campbell on the defense
will be senior Mike Nunan, a three-
year starter, and junior David Farace.
Also returning is senior Carlos Mil-
Ian, who had 21 ground balls in nine
games last year. Freshman Kirk Olsen
will be looked to to contribute on the
defense and as a long-stick mid-
ﬁelder.

Costello will be the anchor of the
defense. The junior made 126 saves
in 12 games last season, the most
saves since John Church's All-Amer-
ican season in 1988. Sophomore
Coleman Devlin also returns. Devlin
had 21 saves in seven games last
season.

At midﬁeld, a strong corps of
veterans will return. Junior Todd
Garliss has moved to the midﬁeld
from attack, where he was third on
the team in scoring last year. Garliss
will be teamed with senior Jim Jones
and junior Clark Wight.

On attack, the Generals will have
to ﬁnd a way to replace John Ware,
who graduated as the school's sixth
all-time leading scorer. Senior Chris
Mastrogiovanni will move to attack
from rriidﬁeld this season and serve
as the go-to guy.

Joining Mastrogiovanni on the
attack will be junior Mike Moseman,
who led the team in assists last sea-
son. Moseman will serve as the quar-
terback on offense, which will start
from behind the goal. Also returning
is sophomore Wierni Douoguih, who
exploded for eight goals in the last
four games last season.

The Generals will again face one
of the toughest schedules in Division
III. The schedule, which includes the
always tough ODAC, features clashes

keep its stranglehold on the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference. W&L
has won five straight ODAC tennis
titles, but the league keeps getting
better and gunning for W&L. It is
the price you pay for past success,
but Franke wouldn't have it any other
way.

“We've had some good workouts
this spring, so we're in pretty good
shape for this point in the season,"
he said. “Our goal is to be in the
top 12 in the nation and get the bid

to the tournament again. We hope to
defend our ODAC crown again, too.
All of that is going to be tougher to
do this year, but we look forward to
the challenge."

with Ithaca, Franklin and Marshall
and Washington College.

In his first season, Stagnitta will
take nothing for granted. His key is
to take things one at a time and look
for improvement with each outing.
“I’d like us to be better every game,
and I'd like them to have fun, too.
I'd like us to beat the teams we're
supposed to beat and then sneak up
on a few other teams. We can be
tough to prepare for in just two days.
People don't know what to expect,
and,I think that gives us the oppor-
tunity to surprise some people."

On Wednesday, the Generals,
ranked 20th in the pre—season Div-
ision III poll, kicked off the Stagnitta
era against Division I power Virginia,
ranked 5th in the Division I poll, in
Scott Stadium.

Throughout the first ﬁve minutes,
Virginia had the ball in the W&L
defensive zone, but managed to come
away with nothing. Costello stood up
to ﬁve shots from the Cavaliers be-
fore W&L managed to get control of
the ball.

The Generals couldn't muster an
attack, and with 8:57 to play, fresh-
mam Kevin Pehlke started his scoring
barrage. He scored four of the first
ﬁve UVa. goals as the Cavaliers
jumped out to a 6-0 lead midway
through the second quarter.

The Generals then got on the
board off their extra-man offense.
Moseman had the ball behind the
goal and hit Mastrogiovanni as he cut
to the net. Mastrogiovanni beat UVa.
goalie Tom Groeninger for the first
W&L goal of the season. The goal
made the score 6-1 with 4:50 to play
in the half.

The indoor track season at
Washington and Lee is not a long
one. It is also overshadowed by
the lengthier outdoor season,
which tends to look upon its
shorter counterpart as a training
period.

 Ellis  ...however. junior .
Carl Gilbert is attracting some
‘attention to the men’s _indoor
track team. At the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Indoor Cham-
pionships held last week in
Lynchburg, Gilbert was named the
ODAC Indoor Track Performer-
of-the—Year. At that meet, Gil-
bert placed second in the long
and triple jumps, won the 440-
yard dash and was a member of
the ﬁrst-place mile relay team.

During the VMI Winter Re-
lays, Gilbert qualiﬁed for the
Division IH national indoor cham-
pionships in the triple jump with
a distance of 46 feet, 11 inches.
Gilbert, who finished third in the
triple jump, was the only Division
III athlete to place in any event at
that meet. Gilbert also placed
first in the triple jump at the
Lynchburg Invitational with a leap
of 44-11.

For his acheivements, Gilbert
has been named The Ring-tum
Phi's Athlete-of-the-Month for
February.

’ Gilbert will travel to Smith
College in Northampton, Mass.
for the national championships on
March 9-10.

I |ATHLETE-OF-THE-MONTH

Wight gave W&L hope as they
went in the locker room as he was
the recipient of a Moseman feed on
the crease. Wight’s goal with 33
seconds to play made it a 9-2 game
at the half and put some positive
light on an otherwise dismal first
half.

Costello, after holding UVa. to
just two goals in the ﬁrst quarter, had
a rough second period as was pulled
after the ninth Virginia goal. Costello
did make 12 ﬁrst half saves.

Junior Julian Gillespie replaced
Costello in the goal and held UVa. to
just two third quarter goals. Soph-
omore Jeff Roberts managed the
Generals only tally of the period as
he beat his man around the goal and
scored his ﬁrst career goal to make
the score 11-3 at the end of the third
quarter.

Pehlke opened the fourth quarter
with his fifth goal of the day to go
along with two assists, and Gabby
Roe added his second goal to make
it 14-3 with 6:12 to play.

W&L did not quit, though. Rob-
erts worked a nice two-man game
with Mastrogiovanni, and Mastro-
giovanni worked free on the crease
for his second goal of the day with
2:11 left. The tandem hooked up
again on the fast break forty seconds
later, and Mastrogiovamii took
another feed from Roberts to score
his third goal of the afternoon.

Mastrogiovanni’s hat trick closed
the scoring in the 14-5 defeat. Gil-
Iespie made nine saves in the second
half as he held UVa. to just ﬁve
goals in thirty-plus minutes of work.

The Generals will begin ODAC
play Tuesday when they travel to
Randolph-Macon _ I

“Having qualiﬁed that early in
the indoor season gives me confi-
dence in my jumping," Gilbert
said. “I hope to come out okay.”

Head men’s track coach Nor-
ris Aldridge said Gilbert has a
chance to place high at the cham-
pionships.

“The triple jumper from
Lynchburg is ranked second in
the nation and Carl has beaten
"liirri'," Aldiidge said.

The multi-purpose performer
also excels during the outdoor
season. Last spring he qualified
for the outdoor national champi-
onships in the triple jump. His
qualifying jump of 47-10 set a

school record.

Gilbert was also all-ODAC in
the 400-meter individual and relay
events during the outdoor season
last year.

For the upcoming outdoor
season Gilbert said he hopes to
qualify for the national champion-
ships in 400-meter and mile re-
lays.

An accounting major who
hails from Bassett, Virginia, Gil-
bert also plays slotback for the
Generals’ football team.

When he is not ﬂying through
the air, running around a track or
running into defensive secondaries
on a football ﬁeld, Gilbert said he
likes to relax with music and
shoot hoops.

Congratulations to Carl Gil-
bert, The Ring-tum Phi's Athlete-
of-the-Month for February.

Macon ends Generals’ year 75-64

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

For twenty minutes, it looked as
if the 1989-90 Washington and Lee
basketball season would not end in
the semiﬁnal round of the Old Dom-
inion Athletic Conference tournament.

The Generals, seeded fifth, were
facing top-seeded Randolph-Macon
for the third time this season last
Thursday night in the Salem Civic
Center. From the outset, things look-
ed as if they would go W&L's way.

At a luncheon before the games,
R—MC coach Hal Nunnally announced
that his top players would not be at
100 percent. 6-9 center Pat Holland
was recovering from mononucleosis,
which cost him 20 pounds off his
240-pound frame. Point guard Ken
Potosnak was slowed by the ﬂu, and
6-6 forward Jeff Skop had a deep
thigh bruise.

Nunnally was right to some ex-
tend. Neither Potosnak nor Skop
would be a factor. The two combined
for just nine points, and the ﬁfth
starter, John Lawn, added just one.

Still, Randolph—Macon, ranked
17th in Division III, would not go
away. But W&L looked as if they
would take it from the Yellow Jack-
(:15.

When sophomore Mark Melton
converted a three-point play, the
Generals had their biggest lead of the
first half, 17-11 with 12:53 to play.

Randolph-Macon took the lead 22-
21 when Potosnak hit a three pointer
for his only points, but W&L re-
gained the lead seconds later when
Holton buried his second three
pointer of the half.

The teams traded baskets until
freshman Bryan Watkins connected
on a three point shot with 2:59 to
play to give W&L a 35-32 lead. But
that would be W&L’s last basket of
the half, as R-MC scored the last

four points of the half to lead 36-35
at intermission. ‘

In the first half, Kagey was going
crazy, scoring 10 points in the first
stanza. W&L shot 56 percent to stay
in the contest, led by Holton’s 10
points. R-MC had the lead mainly
because they had connected on 65
percent of their shots.

In the second half, the Generals
tightened up according to head coach
Verne Canﬁeld, and that's when
things turned sour. “We missed
some easy stickbacks, and when that
happened, I could sense in our kids
that they were pressing and trying to
do too much. That’s really where the
game got away.”

After junior center Chris Jacobs
scored to bring the Generals to a 40-
39 deﬁcit at the 18:05 mark, R-MC
held W&L without a ﬁeld goal for

the next 10:21. When Jacobs scored,
he ended an 18-5 Yellow Jackets’
run. Reserves Jeff Taylor and Troy
Smith, spelling Potosnak and Holland,
combined for 12 points during the
run. The run propelled the Yellow
Jackets to a 75-64 win and a place in
the ﬁnals opposite Emory and Henry.

Jacobs was the lone bright spot

The Ring-tum Phl, March 1, 1990

for the Generals in the second half,
scoring 11 of his 17 points. Holton
finished with 15. W&L shot 28 per-
cent in the second half compared to
Randolph-Macon’s 71 percent.

The Generals earned their place in
the semifinals by virtue of their 77-
63 win at Hampden-Sydney in the
quarterfinals.

W&L came from behind in the
second half to take the lead and then
break open the game for the fourteen
point win. Hampden-Sydney led 49-
44 with 13 minutes to go, but the
Generals went on a 10-0 run to take
the lead for good at 54-49 on junior
forward Ed Hart's follow up and two
baskets from Jacobs.

Russell Tumer completed a three-
point play to make it 54-52, but that
would be as close as Hampden-Syd-
ney would get as the Generals went
on a 11-2 run sparked by six points
from junior forward Craig Hatﬁeld to
extend the lead to 65-54.

The Generals led for much of the
first half, sparked by 10 points from
Hart and eight from junior Pat Gal-
lavan. Jacobs gave W&L its biggest
lead at 32-26 with 2:50 to play in the
half before Hampden-Sydney went on
a 10-0 run. Jacobs’ basket with four
seconds left cut the lead to two at the
break, 36-34.

The Tigers led 49-44 with 13:20
to play, but junior guard Jim Casey’s
basket off penetration started the
Generals on their first decisive run.
H-SC got only as close as six, 65-
59, on a Turner basket with 1:57 to
play. W&L iced the win with a Jac-
obs dunk with 1:25 to play and rolled
out of Hampden-Sydney with a 14-
point upset win of the fourth seed.

Jacobs paced ﬁve W&L players in
double ﬁgures with 20 points. Hart
finished with 14 points and eight
rebounds off the bench. Hatﬁeld
scored 12 points, all in the second
half.

The Generals ﬁnished the season

15-12. Jacobs was a second team all-
ODAC performer as well as a first
team all-South Atlantic region per-
former. Holton was the leading vote
getter on the South Atlantic region’s
all—academic team. Hatﬁeld ﬁnished
the season as the ODAC’s leading
rebounder at 7.8 a contest.

Swimmers set to dive into nationals

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

On first glance, the season record
of the Washington and Lee women’s
swim team appears outstanding.

The Generals captured the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pionship title for the third straight
year, placed third out of seven in the
Atlantic States competition, broke a
number of records, and produced an
athlete who qualified for the NCAA
championships and won ODAC
Swimmer-of-the-Year, freshman Claire
Dudley.

To the coach and swimmers,
however, the team’s final results
point to a few areas which require
even more improvement and which
provide the motivation for new goals.
Head coach Page Remillard, who was
awarded ODAC Co-Coach-of-the-
Year, noted the underlying factors
which have lessened the team's satis-
faction with itsi performance.

Although she didn’t get it, Remil-
lard thought that one of his swim-
mers should have been awarded At-
lantic States Swimmer of the Year.

“[Freshman] Stephanie Sauers is
the only girl to win three ODAC
events and three Atlantics’ events,”
said Remillard. “She really beat the
outswam the girl who got the
award.”

Perhaps the most frustrating aspect
about ti.‘ ODAC/Atlantics meet was
what Remillard considers to be his
mistaken approach toward training
junior Sharon Coleman.

Coleman, who was ‘an NCAA
Division III All-American last year,
did not qualify for Nationals this
season. This year, Coleman won two
of her three events but missed cut-
off time for Nationals.

“I believed Sharon was strong
enough to win and qualify for Na-
tionals, so I chose not to completely
prepare her for the ODACS,” Remil-
lard said.“It was a strategy which I
thought was appropriate, but in retro-

 mmmmmmmmmmmm

Kris Am oroso

...leadership will be missed

spect I can see that the training pro-
gram was my mistake. It would have
been correct for a faster pool. I’m
just thankful that Sharon is a junior
so she has another chance.”
Remillard is very aware of this
season's positive aspects, though, and
has put everything in perspective.
“In most aquatics programs, this
would be considered a very good
year — we just expect a little more.

That will be our motivation. I’d like
this to be our worst season,” he said.
“It's ironic to find ourselves in the
situation of complaining, but we have
to look at the reasons why we're not
even better."

With the success the team had this
season and the emergence of frosh
Dudley and Sauers, Remillard still
will miss those who graduate. In
particular, senior Kris Amoroso will
be sorely missed next year.

“Her great characteristics have
contributed so much to our three
ODAC titles. She has been a joy to
work with for four years. In fact,
they’re all a terriﬁc group of athletes
who are totally committed,” Reniil-
lard said. “I just want them to
achieve what they want next year."

Chip Nordhoff

...qualifies for nationals

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

Although the Washington and Lee
men's third-place ﬁnish at the Atlan-
tic States Championships this ‘past
weekend concluded the tearn’s swim-
ming season, four swimmers will
move on to compete in the Division
III national championships.

“I don't like being third at Atlan-
tic States," head coach Page Remil-
lard said. “Next year won't be soon
enough [to return to the top spot]."

The Generals had been the two-
time defending champions of the
Atlantic States.

At last weekend's meet, which
was held at Hollins College, UNC-
Charlotte placed first, Mary Washing-
ton second and Radford fourth.

W&L swam to first-place victories
in eight out of 18 events, but with
only eight swimmers the team lacked
the depth needed to win the meet.

“A championship meet scores 12
places and lack of size will kill
you," said Remillard.

ﬁed for the national championships in
the 200-yard freestyle (1:43.12) and
the 200-yard backstroke (1258.78).
Nordhoff’s time in the 200-yard free-
style is the third best among Division
III times recorded this season while
his time in the 200-yard backstroke
ranks fourth.

Nordhoff will also compete on
W&L's 800-yard relay team at na-
tionals. The rest of the team is com-
posed of junior Jim Dunleavy and
sophomores Doug Brown and Jay
Smith.

Smith improved his unbeaten
streak to 30 after winning all six of
his individual races during the week-
end. Smith also lowered his national
qualifying times in the 50-yard free-
style (21.46) and the 100-yard back-
stroke (54.42). Smith, who will also
swim in the 100-yard freestyle at
nationals, set his qualifying times
earlier in the season.

“This is not the time for the
streak to end,” Rerrtillard said, refer-
ring to nationals. “I think Jay's
capable of winning it [a national
title]. I know he'll be fast, it’s just
a matter of how fast the opposition
will be.”

Brown missed the national quali-
fying standard by two seconds in two
events. He ﬁnished the 1,650-yard
freestyle with a time of 16:38.54 and
the 500-yard freestyle in 4:45.81.

“It was a great swim from a
coaching standpoint," Remillard said
of Brown's effort in the 1,650-yard
freestyle. “But I felt for him as a
friend."

Overall, Remillard said he was
very happy with the team's perform-
ance this season, noting that the small
squad finished with an 8-5 record.

“We're a young team. I expected
a building year and now we've got
an excellent base. Next year we
anticipate ﬁlling some of the empty
spots and then we'll be right back in
the hunt," Remillard said.

A Suppleme-n’r To The Ring-Tum Phi ¥

 

The Ring-tum Phl Fancy Dress Supplement, March 1, 1990

 

Finally, the long-await-
ed announcement of this
year's Fancy Dress theme:
“Gatsby’s Great Gala.”
The idea behind the
theme is to re-enact one
of the famed parties
given by millionaire Jay
Gatsby in 1925, as
portrayed in F. Scott Fitz-
gerald’s classic novel The
Great Gatsby. Included
in this supplement is an
array of glimpses into the
events that await each
and every one of you
next weekend: the his-
tory, the decorations, the
bands, the traditions.
Take some time in read-
ing this supplement to
catch the pulse of the
T9203, the glimmer of Jay
Gatsby so you can better
enjoy Fancy Dress week-
end.

Fancy Dress team
is right on target

As always, Washington and Lee stays at the forefront of
trends in the country. We went co-educational before it
was all the rage, and now the Fancy Dress Committee has
picked a theme popular culture is turning back toward. In
the March issue of European Travel & Life, the following
paragraph was printed...three months aﬂer the theme had
been selected by the committee.

Victoriana and postmodernism
aren't for cvcrybody. We’ve detected
a certain nostalgia for the roaring twen-
tics, when women were emancipated,
the ﬂapper was born, jazz took hold,
and Deco dawned. it was the day of
the speakeasy, The Great Gatsby. and
the Charleston, and here it comes a-
gain.

Congratulations ta the FD Steering Committee for keeping
tabs on what's hot!

By Pamela Kelley
Entertainment Editor

The year is 1925, part of the
“Roaring 20s,” “The Jazz Age,”
a “New Era”of prosperity cele-
brating the ending of a world war
and a time of social change. It is
the year of The Great Gatsby.

During the 1920s, the Vic-
torian values of the past were
being eclipsed. The violence,
pessimism, and disillusion created
by World War I steered Amer-
ican society away from tradition
and toward experimentation.
Progressivism was on the rise
and the United States was rapidly
becoming a world super power.
The rise of cities and urbaniza-
tion created the mood for a mass
culture and anonymity. The in-
vention of automobiles and planes
allowed people a greater mobility
they had never enjoyed before.
Prohibition was in effect, thanks
to the 18th Amendment (1919)

and an illegal industry was rising.

to fill the voids it created. Along
with the spirit of a new sexual
freedom that the 19th Amend-
ment to the Constitution (1920)
granted women with the right to
vote, these helped set the stage
for the emergence of the liberated
woman, the ﬂapper, and her beau
the sheik.

These feelings induced a
reckless or decadent sort of be-
havior among society, with an

appetite for debauchery and ex-

travagance. The sheer materialism
and joy of irresponsibility of this
time is portrayed well in F. Scott
Fitzgerald's novel The Great
Gatsby, which tells the story of
several prominent members of
New York’s high society. Be-
cause of Fitzgerald’s defmess in
depicting the attitudes of his
time, sometimes the general time
period is referred to as the Fitz-
gerald Era.

New York, Paris, and Hol-
lywood were considered the three

 

The Twenties!

Times of decadence, sophistication

 

major style centers of the world.
There one was sure to see the
distinguishing aspects of the 20s.

Artistically, a style of decora-
tion and architecture called art
deco was popular in the 20s. Art
deco, a term coined in Paris, was
characterized by strearn-lined,
geometric forms and attempted to
combine elegance and fine crafts-
manship with industrial technol-
ogy. It was used for the design
of luxury liners and elaborate
buildings. One famous example is
the interior of Radio City Music
Hall. Art deco furnishings oozed
sensuality and grace with their
use of precious and exotic mater-
ials like ebony, ivory, lacquer,
and stepped layerings.

The 1920s is called the “Jazz
Age” because of the growing

__popularity of jazz and swing

music. Jazz is said to take its
origins from afro-american song,
coming initially from cities like
New Orleans and Chicago in the
form of ragtime and the blues.
The jazzy styles were charac-
terized by the sounds of brass,
reed, and rhythm sections. The
incorporation of these created a
popularity for big bands and such
great musicians such as Duke
Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and
Scott Joplin.

Along with the growing af-
finity for upbeat music came the
enjoyment of dancing to it in the
fortn of dances like the Charles-
ton, which involves simultaneous
feet twisting and rapid forward
and backward kicking motions.
The Charleston became one sym-
bol of the flapper‘s rebellious
abandon. *

WW1 and the 19th Amend-
ment had shown women indepen-
dence, work, experience in the
business world, and suffrage,
while the men were away from
home ﬁghting. they didn't want
to relinquish those when the
ﬁghting was over.

The flappets’ appearances told
a lot about the attitudes behind
them. A typical ﬂapper had bob-

Prohibition produced a whole new
vocabulary to describe the results of
drinking too much. One could be-
come blind, blotto, buried, cockeyed,

embalmed, high,

lit, oiled, ossified,

bed hair and a slender boyish
appearance that almost denied her
femininity and pronounced her

equality to men. To add to this,-
the style employed the use of a‘
brassiere that ﬂattened the bosom, -

rather than enhanced it. Gone
were bulky undergarments. Skirts
became shorter. Legs became
barer. Belts were wom low on

the hips, in order to avoid accen-‘

tuating them. Mannish hats and
long necklaces accessorized the
outfits.

The sheik, or the 205 male,
usually sported full trousers with
a wide cuff, which were called
“Oxford Bags.” As well, for the
fashionable male, a gabardine
sports coat or a brown coat and
waistcoat completed the outfit.
Calf-length raccoon coats were
very popular with college men
also.

The young women and men
also deﬁed convention by drink-
ing and smoking in public. They
might do so at the elaborate
parties, for which the age is
known or in “speakeasies,”
which were bars or saloons where
alcohol was served. These might
front as ice cream parlors or soda
fountains. Prohibition supposedly
galvanized the soft-drink industry,
because the sugary-sweet drinks
could hide the taste and ap-
pearance of alcohol.

Prohibition was also being
thwarted by bootleggers, who
were willing to smuggle or make
alcohol for the many who wished
to drink — for money. Gradually

these small entrepreneurs moved
into larger, more organized gangs.
Using machine guns, armed cars,
mass murders and other such
tactics, leaders like Chicago’s Al
Capone eliminated their competi-
tion, bought police and officials,
and controlled elections, creating
bootlegging empires. This escala—
tion in crime later led legislators
to repeal prohibition with the 21st
Amendment (1933).

The technological achieve-
ments that brought radio and
automobiles to the public also
provided it with another form of
ecscape in the form of motion
pictures. Actors like Lon Chaney,
Charles Chaplin, Douglas Fair-
banks Jr., Rudolph Valentino, and
actresses like Greta Garbo, Gloria
Swanson, Mary Pickford, and
Joan Crawford, became like
household names as fantasy lov-
ers in movies that promoted the
wealth, decadent parties, and
materialism that dominated the
era. Hollywood became the home
of motion pictures. As well, it
came to symbolize the
industrialization, urbanization, and
sexuality, that was changing
modern american society.

Although many society mem-
bers, the rich in particular, en-
joyed the freedom the “Roaring
20s” provided, it would eventual-
ly come to an end (with the
Great Depression in 1929). The
hey-day of the ﬂapper and her
antics would end, almost as sadly
as the tale of elusive dreams and
wealth in F. Scott Fitzgerald's
classic novel.

Gatsby mansion to rise again

Decorations to re-create extravagance and gaiety of the Roaring Twenties

an >

Senior Lee Garlowe arranges some of the
scenery at the reproduction of Jay

Gatsby’s lavish mansion for FD.

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

The Great Jay Gatsby was
renowned for his lavish,
exorbitant parties of enormous
size. People from all over New
York drove to Gatsby’s
ostentatious house to party into
the wee hours of the morning.

The decorations at this year's
Fancy Dress will reflect Gatsby,
the great host, in a display of
decadence. Students will re-
create the air of careless abandon
and decadence in the Warner
Center through reproductions of
scenes from Jay Gatsby’s house
and grounds.

For one night, students,
faculty, and alumni will be the
honored guests at one of Gatsby's
famous parties.

Gatsby’s guests will first
encounter a vintage burgundy and
black Rolls Royce in front of the
Warner Center walkway. The car
is just one of the many expensive
cars that brought the wealthy
from all parts of New York in
search of frivolity for the night.

Next, the guests will enter the
gym to see the entranceway
decorated under the supervision
of Nancy Mitchell. A latticed
veranda with ﬂowers will be at
the front of the hallway. A
silver repeating sky line will
contrast against the black walls.
Chandeliers and rose lighting will

. with

guide the way to a ﬂoral fountain
at the rear of the hall.

As the guests enter the big
gym, they will be privy to
Gatsby's personal wardrobe on
the left. Tina Vandersteel, the
creator of this scene, said her
comer is based on the scene in
the movie where Gatsby begins
to throw his shirts around in
frivolous display.

Gatsby is impressing Daisy
with all is material wealth as he
shows her around the house for
the first time. Daisy and the
narrator, Nick Carraway, are
admiring the closet, which is
stuffed with shirts of every shade.
Vandersteel says this reﬂects the
decadence of the Twenties.
Gatsby owns all these superfluous
things, and Daisy is totally
captivated by his ostentatious
wealth. She values these objects
over all else.

The scene will be re—created
two huge closet doors
painted dark a dark cherry wood
color. Gatsby’s initials will be
painted on the doors. Five
oversize shirts, six by eight feet,
on hangers will be ﬂoating out of

the closet. And there will be
rose-colored lighting coming from
within the closet as if it were

glowing.

On the right-hand side is
Gatsby’s ballroom. Senior
Meredith Attwell plans to

decorate with a black and white
checked ﬂoor and walls painted a
rich red. A bar with Gatsby’s
initials will be painted black,
silver and red. Lots of white
roses on pedestals, mirrors and
black and silver urns will
surround the bar.

White roses and other white
ﬂowers will be arrayed
throughout the Warner Center to
reﬂect the dozens and dozens of
white roses Gatsby bought for
Daisy.

As the guests walk to the
back of the big gym, they will
exit to the outside of Gatsby’s
mansion. On their right will be
the gardens prepared under senior
Beckwith Archer’s direction. The
garden signifies the first Gatsby
party Nick ever attended. A
white gazebo will be surrounded
by mums, grass and ivy as well
as topiary trees, which are
rounded on the bottom then get
skinnier then bowl out again and
repeat the pattern until they thin
out at the top.

As part of the garden party
scene, red and white streamers
will cover the ceiling above the
swing band like the red and
white tents of Gatsby’s parties.

After walking in the gardens,
the guests can follow the red

carpet leading up the stairs to
Gatsby’s gray dock on West Egg.
They can peer over the railing at
the lights glowing from beneath
the waves and at the green light
on the end of the dock
representing the ﬂashy image of
a new money man. Or they can
stare at the stars of the night sky
just as Gatsby used to when he
stared wistfully across the bay at
East Egg where Daisy lived.
Junior Sumner Timberlake and
senior Alicia Hay are creating the
water with blue and green
cellophane paper and are using
black star paper for the night sky.
The next stop is the balcony,
where a fountain surrounded by
columns represents the area near
Gatsby's pool. Light glowing
from the inside of sheer material
on the columns will give an
ethereal appearance to the scene.
Also under junior Paul Lee's
direction contrasting white and
black images will contribute to
the unreal quality of the

glamorous, frivolous Twenties.
If the couples are looking

for a little more excitement and
want to leave the romantic
atmosphere Gatsby’s grand
mansion and the sounds of the
Peter Duchin orchestra, they can
wander over to the little gym and
The Radiators. The sky line of
New York will run along the
railing of the indoor track.

Cigarette girls will sell
cigarettes, gum, mints, and cigars
and will have matchbooks
specially designed with the Fancy
Dress insignia. Cokes will be
sold in the big gym, little gym
and balcony.

Alex Hitz, the chairman of
the Fancy Dress committee, said
the lighting designed by Gary
Humiston of the W&L theater
will be incredible this year.

"We’re concentrating on big
and bold this year because the
little details get lost in the dark,"
Hitz said.

The decorations are big and
bold to fit with the boldness and
gaiety of the Roaring Twenties.
So be a little bold. You are
cordially invited to a party given
by Mr. Jay Gatsby on March 9,
1925.

In honor of the Fancy Dress
theme, I have been asked to
familiarize Washington and Lee
students with the plot of “The
Great Gatsby.” There is one
small problem: the last time I
read F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic
was during my junior high days.
Of course it would be much
more impressive if I provided a
detailed analysis of the book; I
could dazzle my readers with a

brilliant interpretation of
Fitzgerald’s unique style and
thematic devices. But I know

that my amateurish efforts at
critical interpretation would risk,
deservedly, the wrath of the
English department. Therefore I
will stay on territory that is
slightly more friendly; I will take
the cowards way out and review
the movie version of “The Great
Gatsby.”

“The Great Gatsby,” which
came out in the 1970’s, is a
extravagant production. The film
assembled some of Hollywood's
most talented actors and
actresses: Robert Redford as Jay
Gatsby, Mia Farrow as Daisy
Buchanan, Bmce Dem as Tom
Buchanan, Karen Allen as Myrtle
Wilson, and Sam Waterson as
Nick Carraway.

Carraway is the narrator of
the story, and he leads us into

GREAT
GAISBY

l’n'zai:nAu>

The Ring-tum Phi Fancy Dress supplement, March 1, 1990

The movie behind the theme

Peppers: movie '3 bright setting belies its dark, tragic ending

the mysterious life of Jay Gatsby.
Carraway does offer his own
thoughts from time to time, but
usually he hovers around the
comers like a judgmental eye and
allows us to form our own
opinions.

Since most of you won't see
the film before Fancy Dress, I
will reveal all the plot twists of
“The Great Gatsby.” The
movie focuses on Jay Gatsby and
his desperate yearning for his one
true love: Daisy Buchanan.
Gatsby fell in love with Daisy
before the first World War.
Unfortunately, shortly into their
romance, he was called away to
defend his country. Gatsby sends
Daisy a letter and asks her to
wait for his return, but Daisy
marries the rich and arrogant
Thomas Buchanan. As she later
explains to Gatsby, she married
Buchanan because “rich girls
don't marry poor boys, Jay
Gatsby.” And the young Gatsby
was very poor.

The movie begins one
summer when Carraway rents a
house in West Egg, which ,is
close to his cousin Daisy. His
small dwelling is next to
Gatsby’s magniﬁcent mansion,
and at night Nick observes
Gatsby’s decadent parties. Nick
comments that in Gatsby’s
enchanted gardens “men and
women went like moths”
attracted to the dizzying wealth.
And of Gatsby he says “he

Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel The Great
Gatsby when it was released in 1925.

represented everything for which
I have an unaffected scorn.” But
Gatsby “turned out alright in the
en .”

The character of Jay Gatsby is
an enigma. His murky past is
clouded with lies and myths.
Some gossip that he is the cousin
of the Kaiser, others idly remark
that his eyes reveal the soul of a
killer. Nor do people know how
Gatsby came to his unknown
wealth. At his splendid parties
Gatsby stands above the crowd
and silently observes the drunken
fray. Yet one night he invites
Nick to his party, and later calls
his poorer neighbor to his office.
He strikes up an awkward
friendship with Nick and, as they
relationship develops, uses the
young man to reach Daisy.

Nick is friendly with the
Buchanans although they move in
different worlds. Daisy is a
shallow, bored, flighty woman
who has her every whim instantly
satisﬁed. But she still pines for
something more..rHer philosophy
of life is rather simple: “when
my daughter was born, I said I'm
glad its a girl and I hope she's a
little fool...that’s the best thing a
girl can be in this world."
Daisy herself is a “little fool”
who smothers any last vestiges of
human emotion with the heavy
blanket of greed.

The story juxtaposed two
illicit affairs that involve the
Buchanans. Tom has a fling
with Myrtle Wilson (Karen
Black). Myrtle is the wife of a
poor gas station attendant named
George Wilson. The dense
woman is overpowered by Tom's
brute strength and wealth.
George Wilson is perhaps one of
the few sympathetic characters in
the film. He lives in a desolate
area between East and West Egg.
Nick labels this area “a fantastic
farm where ashes grow like
wheat." The only thing of value
to George Wilson is slowly being
taken by a man who has
everything. It is in this valley of
dust that Fitzgerald presents one
of his dominant themes: a old
billboard advertisement that
displays only a pair of piercing
eyes. To Wilson, these eyes
represent the all-seeing gaze of
God. The question we must

consider: does Wilson's God only
watch over this valley of death,
or is the deity also judging the
rich?

The sordid affair between
Tom and Myrtle is in stark
contrast to the gauzy and dreamy
bond between Gatsby and Daisy.
In Gatsby's mind, Daisy is the
goal he desperately fought to
reach; even his vast wealth is
merely another path to her. At

 

night he stands on his veranda
and watches the green lamp at
the end of Daisy’s dock. For
Gatsby, the green shaft of light
represents the culmination of a
dream.

Nick warns his friend that
“you can't repeat the past."
Gatsby replies “of course you
can." Gatsby is mesmerized by
an intoxicating memory that
blinds him to Daisy’s flawed
character. In one of ﬁlm’s most
powerful scenes, Gatsby and
Daisy dance in a darkened room
around a single candle; he
wearing his military uniform and
she finally allows him to whisper
his words of adoration. But both
love affairs, one sordid and one
fantasy, will end in tragedy.

On the way back from New
York, Gatsby's bright yellow
Rolls Royce accidentally strikes
and kills Myrtle Wilson. She
thought it was Tom Buchanan's
car, and she rushed out in front
of the car hoping Tom would
stop and rescue her from the
enraged George Wilson. The car
doesn't stop and leaves the
broken body lying in the road.
But it wasn't Gatsby that struck
the fleeing women, Daisy was
driving the car. When the
grieving Wilson comes to the
Buchanan house, Tom Buchanan,
knowing of Daisy’s love affair
with Gatsby, tells Wilson who is
the real owner of the car. Wilson
goes to Gatsby's mansion, shoots
the millionaire, and then kills
himself. Ironically, the “great"
Gatsby, the man who had thrown
parties for hundreds and whose

F. Scott Fiizigeraid

name was mentioned as royalty,
has two people attend his burial:
his grieving father and Nick
Carraway.

A few months later Nick
bumps into Daisy and Tom.
Daisy hasn’t even contacted Nick
since the funeral and breezily
informs him that her house
remodeling has taken up too
much time. As Nick watches the
couple and their parade of servant
leave the hotel, he says that
“they're careless people...they
smash things up and then retreat
into their money."

Where is the message? In the
ﬁnal scene the camera slowly
drifts through the dark rooms of
Gatsby’s empty house. Finally
the lens lingers on Gatsby's
yellow convertible, dried blood
splashed across its headlights, as
a scratchy record plays “When
You and I Were Seventeen"--the
same song Gatsby played when
pining for Daisy. All this vast
wealth didn’t give him his dream.

The movie “The Great
Gatsby” is a griping tale of
wealth and immorality; as a
Fancy Dress theme its dark
message might be lost. Enjoy
the lavish decorations as you
walk into the Warner Center.

Yet recognize that F. Scott
Fitzgerald doesn't glorify the
decadence of “the Roaring

Twenties,” he decries its
selﬁshness and immorality. I
don't want to place a dark cloud
over Fancy Dress, I think "The
Great Gatsby” will be an unique
theme, but don't forget the seamy
side of the novel.

More than 20 questions for FD

The Fling-tum Phi Fancy Dress Supplement, March 1, 1990

Chairman Alex Hitz about the ball

 

By Stacy Morrison
Editor

Q: Why do you think this
theme translates well for Fancy
Dress?

A: Because what we're really
trying to concentrate on with this
year’s theme is Gatsby’s really
fantastic parties. And think that
Fancy Dress is the most fantastic
party in college.

Q: What’s your favorite part
about this year’s Fancy Dress
Ball?

A: That's a hard question. I
like all of it. I love that we're
having a car. I love the poster. I
love the invitations. I think the
cup is fantastic. I love our
bands. I'm really excited about
the whole thing. The Great Gat-
sby is one of my favorite books.
I'm lucky that theme got elected;
it got 53 percent of the vote.

Q: Explain the car.

A: We've got a vintage Rolls
Royce that’s going to be a part
of the decorations out in front
and its going to be equipped with
a driver as if to suggest that
someone had just been dropped
off at the party. It's black and
burgundy and it's just amazing.
It's being driven down here on a
truck from Washington that night
and taken back the same night.
It'll be out front.

Q: Is there anything that’s
especially different or remark-
able. about Fancy Dress this
year?

A: There have been a lot more
restraints put on us this year.
We have monetary restraints and
we don't have any charge‘ ac-
counts this year, which makes it
very, very difficult to run Fancy
Dress. Other than that I think in
terms of decorations we're doing
a lot more with live plants this
year, and I think for the first
time in a long time we've got

reaily good people to work on it A

who really, really care. I know
they did last year, too. But in
past years its just been the kind

of people who want to get a free -_
ticket, but everyone is really .

psyched up about it this year.

Q: How else did the ﬁnancial
regulations affect spending?

A: It was losing the charge
accounts mainly, and the fact" that
we don't have a checkbook any-
more, because checks are only
cut on Tuesday and Friday. So
it's very difficult for spur-of-the-

moment things like lumber —
we're going through that right
now [with construction beginning
this week] — paint and paint-
brushes and stuff like that, things
we cannot wait until Friday for.
It's very, very hard. It's making
it very hard to put up the decora-
tions on time, and I certainly
hope they [the EC] will consider
next year not doing the same
thing. I think the way they
could do it is to have separate
Fancy Dress accounts, separate
charge accounts. That way,
instead of just SAB, it would be
Fancy Dress charge accounts.

Q: How do the accounts and
committees overlap?

A: The Fancy Dress Committee
is a sub—committee of the SAB,
but the money is all separate.
we don't get any student funds
except for what they pay.

Q: Does Fancy Dress pay for
itself‘?

'A: Yes, from the ticket and

memorabilia sales.

Q: How many people usually
attend?

A: Usually about 2,000. We're
estimating, just to be safe this
year, we're counting on 1,300,
but I think it'll be considerably
more_than that.

Q: Do you think the law
school’s being on vacation is
going to hurt the attendance?
A: I really don't think so. I
think a lot of people were upset
about it at the law school at first,
but we tried to find a better time.
The reason that,is was such a
.problem this year is because
February break was moved back
a week, and Fancy Dress is
usually two weeks after February
break, and when they moved
February break back, too. I've
gotten mixed reviews from the
law school. I wrote them a letter
that said how sorry I was that we
,weren’t going to be having Fancy
Dress when they were in session.
But it is also the night that they
get out. I can't speak for them
because I'm not a law student,
but I would be really excited that
I didn’t have to go to class the
next Monday. I'm sorry the
scheduling has been so much of
a problem.

Q: What’s been the most dif-
ficult duty in being Fancy Dress
Chairman? I ‘

A: None of it'is easy. I think
the most difficult thing probably
has been coordinating ‘everything’

to get here on’ time -— all the
ordering all the posters all the
memorabilia. Having these
people work on such tight
schedules, it’s really hard. It's a
lot of organization.

Q: What’s been your favorite
thing?

A: My favorite thing has been
working with all people. Like I
said, we've got a fantastic group
and they're really excited about
it, they've got great ideas and so
ma.ny of them just want to do the
best job possible.

Q: How did this theme get
selected?

A: It was elected. There was a
vote on themes. SAB members-
at-large present ideas and we
choose the top eight, then we
have another ballot. This theme
got 53 percent of the vote, and I
didn't even vote. Neithcr Will
[Joncs, Fancy Dress Vicc—Chair—
man] nor I voted.

Q: What other themes were in
consideration?

A: Enchantment Under the Sea,
Disneyland, Monte Carlo, Las
Vegas, Masquerade Ball, A
Winter Palace, Rodeo, Graceland

and Willie Wonka and the
Chocolate Factory. I think they
all would have been great

themes.

Q: What do you think of Fan-
cy Dress as a costume ball?

A: I think it's a great idea, I
really do. And I think this year,
because of the 20s theme, that
people really can really do a lot
with costumes, if they want to.
"Costume rental now is so expen-
sive, plus it's hard tolget it all
coordinated so that the costumes
will be here on time. It's too
bad that there's not a really,
really 7 good costume shop in
Lexington that could supply Fan-
cy Dress. I think if they did that
then Fancy Dress could be a
costume ball again. I love that
tradition and I'm sorry that it's
faded out.

Q: Why is the theme kept
secret?
A: Well, the theme is kept
secret- because if it's announced
only a week before the ball
people seem to be so much more
excited about it. I mean, people
are excited about Fancy Dress
anyway, but the fact that the
theme» is kept secret gives extra
anticipation and that kind of
thing. Once it's announced that
-‘week :then- everyone gets really

excited about it.
gets really leaked out, which it
has in some years, it's just not as
exciting for everybody.

Q: We’re you worried about
people’s thinking that no money
was going to be spent on this
year’s ball?

A: Yes, I was worried about
that, because every year it's been
such an issue on how much has
been spent, and every year it's
been humongous ﬁgures. If
people thought that we were not
spending that much then maybe
they would think they were not
getting that much of a ball, and
I don't think that’s true.

Q: Is that -why you requested

to have your most recent EC,

budget hearing closed?

A:,Yes. I didn’t want people to
presuppose the quality of the ball
by how much money was being
spent because I think we've done

amazing things with what we've,

got this year.

Q: What are you most looking
forward to this Fancy Dress
weekend?

A: It being over.

Q: How was the Charlie
Daniels Band selected to play
Thursday night?

A: Bands this time ofyear are.

really :a- problem, because they're

If the themei

either recording or they're on
tour or they're on break and
don't want to come. So, we
went through several possibilities
and finally we found Charlie
Daniels, which is a big name,
which we always look for, at a
pretty good price. Enough people
wanted to hear him so we
thought it would be a good thing.
It was a vote on the SAB board.

Q: How do you feel about
some of the negative reactions
that people are having toward
their playing?

"A: Well, you can please some

of the people some of the time,
but you can't please all of the
people all of the time. I mean, I
understand. We’re trying to
diversify everything as much as
possible. I don't mean to sound
flip, but you can‘ do anything and
someone is always going to have
a gripe with it. We've got a
really diverse Friday night.
We've got Peter Duchin and also
the Radiators and The Waxing
Poetics, so it's not all going to
be Charlie Daniels all weekend.
People criticized B.B. King last
year, too, and I thought it was

Q: Any final words, anything
you want to say to everybody?
A: I just hope everybody has a
good time. That's what it's all
about. I hope the teachers will
let up on me - I've got three
papels due next week.

 

 

 

The Ring-tum Phi Fancy Dress Supplement, March 1, 1990

 

 

‘Rods’ will bring New Orleans fo FD

 

From News Releases

Editor’s Note.‘ The Radiators
are the main attraction rock band
for Fancy Dress. They are play-
ing in Doremus Gymnasium on
Friday night after Waxing Poetics.

The truly great American rock
bands are beyond styles and
trends. Legendary New Orleans
rockers The Radiators fall square-
ly into that category. The band’s
music, an amalgam of inﬂuences
from ‘60s soul to modal jazz,
twin-guitar harmonies and the
undulating rhythms of New Or-
leans rhythm and blues, is a
mysterious brew that has seduced
and captivated audiences across
the United States for the last
decade,

The Rad's wildly eclectic,
marathon-length live performances
have earned the group a hardcore
cult following everywhere they've
played, from Tulane University
animal house frat balls in New
Orleans to frenzied, hanging-
from-the—rafters all—nighters at
New York’s Lone Star Cafe.

Throughout most of their
career, The Radiators have re-
mained out of the music industry
mainstream, releasing privately-
made albums and concentrating
on keeping their live gigs a fresh,
continually evolving process.

Ed Volker, the band’s key-
boardist, vocalist and principal
songwriter, kept spinning his
dreams out into songs-—over 2,000
of them at last count--while
vocalist/guitarist Dave Malone
and guitarist/vocalist Camille
Baudoin developed the most
dynamic two-guitar sound since
the Allman Brothers.

Zig—zaggin' Through Ghost-
land the band’s second album for
Epic Records, finally unleashes
the secret power of this outfit on
the general public. After doc-
umenting the lively vibrations the
band has dubbed “Fish Head
Music” on Epic’s landmark 1987
album Law of the Fish, the band
has now made an LP that com-
bines the drive of its live perfor-
mances with deep-rooted commer-
cial instincts.

Volker and Baudoin, friends

Poetics To open

From Press Releases

Editor's Note: Waxing P0-
etics are scheduled to play Friday
night at the ball in Doremus
Gymnasium. They will open for
The Radiators and will begin to
play at 9 p.m.

Waxing Poetics were formed
five years ago in Norfolk, Vir-
ginia. A four—piece band consist-
ing of David Middleton (vocals,
guitar), Paul Tiers (guitars, vo-
cals), Sean Henncssy (bass), and
Bil Shcarin (dmrns), the band's
initial goal was to play their own
songs in an area whose musical
heritage seemingly had ended

with Gene Vincent’s migration to
the West Coast and Gary “U.S.”
Bond’s~ departure from Norfolk’s
Church Street scene.

After their first gig in early
‘84, Poetics purchased a Rand-
McNally Road Guide and began
to perform almost non-stop re-
gionally. They released a single
in May of ‘85, (“Retum” b/w
“Hermitage") on their own label,

since kindergarten, joined forces
with Frank Bua in the early ‘70s.
Calling themselves the Dogs, they
moved to California and joined a
commune in the Santa Cruz
Mountains with 25 other trans-
planted New Orleanians. The
three returned to New Orleans,
where they worked as the house
band at Big Daddy's on Bourbon
Street, playing background music‘
to strippers. The band evolved
into a group called the Rhap-
sodizers before officially becom-
ing The Radiators on Jan. 28,
1978, during a rehearsal in Ed
Volker’s garage on Waldo Drive.
Malone brought an energetic
vocal presence and tremendous
blues and rhythm and blues guitar
technique to a solid rhythm sec-
tion anchored by blues veteran
Reggie Scanlan on bass. The
band was topped off by percus-
sionist Glenn Sears, who started
plying with The Rads in 1981.
The Radiators have learned
the secrets of New Orleans music
playing behind some of the mu-
sic’s greatest practitioners, from
Professor Longhair to Earl King.

“The important thing we
learned playing behind people
like ‘Fess and Earl King is a
sense of joy,” said Volker. “Earl
is a very loose guy when he
performs, wlrere ‘Fess would

really work your butt off. He was
a spiritual chief. .There’s a
certain Mardi Gras vibe to our
music or a sense of drama in
what we got from ‘Fess. When
we play, we try to transmit that.”

In September of ‘86, the

formcd Emerge label which
released Hermitage in January of
‘87.' With college radio support
and positive press the band ex-
panded their touring base and
began to put together songs for

From News Releases

Editor's Note: The Peter
Duchin Orchestra will be playing
Friday night at the ball in the
Warner Center. They will play
from 9 p.m. to II p.m.

America — especially young
America —— is dancing again the
way it used to. Just ask the man
who's probably its most popular
bandleader - Peter Duchin. When
he played for a large dance at his
daughter’s school not long ago,
Duchin glanced across the room-
ful of swirling couples and ob-
served “ a very, very big change
that had taken place in the last
ten years.”

“We played everything from
old ballads to show times, not
just rock-and-roll," he recalls,
“and yet the floor. was absolutely
crowded the entire evening. Kids
are dancing to music that is more
old-fashioned and more sophisti-
cated than they used to. And I
think they're enjoying it more.”

If anyone should know, it’s
this super-busy musician—entrepre-
neur. For 25 years he has pre-
sided over an array of sparkling
events from his celebrated post at
the piano keyboard- a unique
vantage point on the shifting
tastes of society at play.

Especially high society. Duch-
in’s name has become an intema—
tional symbol of social gloss. It
stands for the Tiffany of orches-
tras, the one most in demand by
the upper crust because its pres-
ence- more than any other- tells
you an affair is top-drawer.

In person, Duchin seems
perfectly made for this heady
world- a dark, smoothly good-
looking man who gives the im-
pression he was bom to wear
black tie and move with conﬁ-
dent grace across the roomful of
jet—setters. But he is also friendly,
direct, and entirely unaffected by
his elite status. When I met him
in his hotel room and brought
him down to the coffee shop for
a chat, he was quick to clarify
his classy image. ‘ '

W&L to welcome Duchin Orchestra

“Society parties are actually a
small part of the 120 jobs a year
I personally play,” he pointed
out, citing college proms, charity
balls, concerts, and dances open
to the public. “It’s a huge cross
section, but of course people
think of me in terms of society
bandleader, because of the tre-
mendous demand for his groups,
which play about 1,000 dates a
year. The “Peter Duchin Orches-
tras,” without Duchin at the
helm, are hot items. But
it's‘ ‘Peter Duchin and his Orches-
tra” that is the real prize. He’s
booked solid for the next four
years, has made over 20 music
albums, and personally turns
down some 800 requests a year.

The places that do get him
include the White House, political
conventions, and the Waldorf-
Astoria, where he's the music
director.

“The fellows in my band can
play anything from today’s Top
40 to that of 40 years ago. They
really have a huge vocabulary.”

In Duchin’s case such eminent
skills are no accident. His broad
background is an American fable
of musical heritage and gilded
youth — with several tragic turns.
His mother was a prominent
socialite, Marjorie Oelrichs. In
the early ‘30s, Eddie Duchin —
who was virtually Piano to mil-
lions of Americans — was play-
ing New York’s Central Park
Casino, a society hangout of the
time. One day Marjorie ap-
proached Eddie at the keyboard,
beginning a publicized romance
that resulted in marriage.

But Marjorie died not long
after Peter’s birth, and the baby,
who was ill himself, was nursed
to health by the famous Holly-
wood writer Anita Loos, a friend
of his mother‘s. During World
War II, Peter lived with his god-
parents, the Averell Harrimans,
on their splendid estate in Arden,

'N.Y. And at 13, Peter learned

that his famous pianist father,

then a World War II naxal offi-

cer, had died. .
Harriman had strong views of

how the rich should live.
“Averell felt, as did Mrs. Harri-
man, that all kids should have
two or three languages, should be
able to play polo and croquet,
and know how to train dogs. But
they should also know how to
muck out stalls, and know right
from wrong. AWe were given all
these things to do daily.”

From the beginning, Duchin
says, “I felt I would be in some
aspect of music, although I didn't
know which. At Yale I majored
in music, and when I went to
Paris I studied serious music and
thought I was going to become a
serious composer.”

But at Yale he also played in
a modem-jazz group — “probably
because I wanted to stand out in
some way,” he says, with traces
of his tony background resonating
pleasantly in his voice. “I had
long hair and wore a cape.”

He may not have become a

classical conductor, but once he’s » .

off the dance floor Duchin’s love

   

    
   
     
     

of serious music and the arts
takes over. The man of 2,000
tunes owns not a single popular
record and doesn't even sample
the competition, such as orchestra
leader Lester Lanin.

“At home I listen exclusively
to classical music and jazz,” he
says. And he finds time, some-
how, to throw his hefty inﬂuence
on the side of the arts in Ameri-
ca, serving in many capacities.

Such a life involves constant
travel, of course, and he usually
takes his tennis racket and fly
rod. He also takes his wife, writ-
er Brooke Hayward, and three
children by a previous marriage,
Jason, Courtney and Colin, who
are in high school and college.
With such a myriad of destina-
tions, does he have to tailor his
music to where he’s playing, or
to the kind of event it is?

“An interesting point,” he
says, ‘.‘We do  a IIAIIIB bll,
depending on the area of the
country, or, I suppose, the socio-,

economic group. But it's only a
matter of finesse.”

“I don’t have a real prefer-
ence among cngagements, but
colleges are a lot of fun because
I get to talk to the K105 and see
what’s happening.”

He feels that “my kids are
more concerned about the future
than certainly I was at their age
or than kids were 10 or 15 years
ago. It has to do, perhaps, with
the possibility of imperrnancnce,
of a finite world.

If Duchin’s movie-script of a
life seems a natural for an auto-
biography, don‘t look for it
soon — his life is on full throttle.
A new and thriving business
venture — Duchin Entertainment -
— takes him to an unaccustomed
spot behind, rather than in front
of, an evening's entertainment.

Most people, though, will
continue to think of Duchin as

the charming figure-at the ’kcy- "

board, making the evening an
event of grace and glitter.

Dash Rip Rock and roll

From News Releases

Kick off your Fancy Dress
weekend Wednesday night with
Dash Rip Rock in the General
Headquarters.

The Lousiana trio are known
for their high-energy, explosive
on—stage performance and will
keep you dancing all night long,
or until the Dixie beer runs out.

Dash takes their musical

. chops from Carl Perkins, Chuck

The Ring-tum Phl Fancy Dress Supplement, March 1, 1990

Berry and Hank Williams, and
their name from a Rock Hudson-
type character on the Flintstones.

Reviewers hail Dash's guitar-
ist/ vocalist/lyricist Bill Davis
with literate lyrics that don't steal
from the hellbent fury of their
rockabilly sound.

In 1987, Dash hit the altema-
tive charts with their debut Dash
Rip Rock. Their album made it to
number 38 on the merits of songs
like “Endeavor," “Pack your
bags" and “DMZ”

cld Dreams, having just com-

pleted their

Last year Dash released their
second album Ace of Clubs on
Mammoth records.

“Bad Dreams," from their
first album tells the story when
Blue Oyster Cult takes over Mr.
Rogers Neighborhood.

In addition to their original
tunes, Dash adds a number of
cover tunes with a southern ﬂair
to their live show. Hank Wil-
liams’ “I saw the light” gets
souped up for the live show.

The band also turns out super-

 

charged covers of “Operator,"
“The Ocean" and “Purple
Haze." They have also been
known to an X-rated version of
Cat Stevens’ “Moonshadow."

Dash is made up of Baton
Rouge natives Davis and Ned
“Hoaky" Hickel (bass) who
started the band in 1985 for a
lack of anything else better to do.
They were joined by Fred
LeBlanc (drurns/vocals) after he
saw one of their early live shows.

Charlie Daniels rosins up his bow

From News Releases

Editor's Note: The Charlie
Daniels band will kick 017' the
oﬂicial Fancy Dress weekend on
Thursday night at the Student
Activities Pavilion. The concert
begins at 9 p.m., and tickets will
be sold at the door for $15, ad-
vance for $8.

The music rocks. And it
rolls. It comes at you hard, born
by the swoop of a ﬁddle, a scar-
ing lead guitar and a boogie-
diiven rhythm section. It is
music that is stylistically inde-
scribable and yet, at the same
time, is unmistakably, quintessen-
tially American.

It comes from a group that
has spent 17 years on the Amer-

ican road and has sold over 10

million albums. It’s made of lots
of boogie and swing, lots of rock
and roll and a whole lot of
country, with maybe even some
jazz thrown in for good measure.

It’s Charlie Daniel Band mu-
sic.

“It’s us. It’s CDB music,"
the headman says as he shrugs
his hefty shoulders. “The only
difference is that maybe we're
playing better than ever before.
It makes a difference with the
band being five pieces-- it makes
it real lean and mean. Well... I’m
not lean and mean, but they
are,” he adds with a laugh.

Charlie Daniels started his
recording career with an album
deal at Kama Sutra Records in
1971. In 1976, he began record-
ing for Epic records. -

In 1979, the Grammy Award
winning single,“The Devil Went
Down to Georgia,” became a #1
hit country record for the group
and opened the doors for the

The Fllng-tum Phi Fancy Dress Supplement, March 1, 1990

CDB at country radio. That
airplay helped propel their record
sales beyond the platinum mark
almost instantaneously.

CDB went on to record what
are now considered landmark
albums in country music- Fire on
The Mountain, Saddle Tramp,
and Million Mile Reflections- to
name a few. But as the market-

Cards from the Heart

PA DISE

 
 
  
 
    

place changed, the band became
labeled as a pop-country “cr-
ossover" act.

“You know, back in the
beginning, we were considered a
rock and roll act” says Daniels,
“and we were told that the
coimtry people wouldn't have any
use for us, even though I'd play-
ed country music all my life.

     
        
 
 
 
  
 
   

 

Back then, the country fans were
listening to Mel Tillis and Porter

Wagoner, and we obviously
didn't fit in."

Daniels continues to win over
fans all over the country by
being a straightforward “simple
man" who enjoys “good Songs.
good music and performing
something well."

“Dancing leads to a happier
and healthier life," says dance-
master Frank Roupas, who has
offered ballroom dancing lessons
to students for the past few
weeks in order to help them
prepare for Fancy Dress.

Roupas, who has taught stu-
dents to waltz, fox trot, rumba
and jitterbug, has taught dance
for 34 years and has become
quite well-known in parts of
Virginia through his dancing
courses. He teaches at various
church and community functions
and travels to private homes and
some colleges like Roanoke
College and UVa. “I am the only
dance teacher who makes house
calls,” he boasts.

Roupas has been making
house calls since the beginning of
his career, and has been offering
classes at UVa for the past 13
years. Roupas said he got the
idea for ballroom dancing classes
at colleges when a UVa student,
who was interested in his lessons
but was too busy to travel to
Roanoke, had him come to Char-
lottesville. He says he now is in
heavy demand for classes there.

When an interested W&L
student could not come to Roupas
six years ago, he traveled to
Lexington as well. Roupas
thought that the classes would not
fare as well at the then all-male
college. However, “It went over
big!” he says. He's been retum-
ing ever since, although he
couldn’t make it back to teach
last year.

Roupas has a very positive

 FD’s dance Teacher

attitude about the lessons, and
says that he has never had any
failures at dancing, because he
works with individuals until they
learn. His students must, how-
ever, practice at least ten minutes
a day, so they will not forget
their new skills.

So far Roupas has held clas-
ses twice, on Feb. 12 and 26. For
those students who wish to learn
the basics, or still want more
practice, he will be available
once more before the ball on
Monday at 7, 8, 9 and 10 p.m.,
in the University Center. Those
returning for more lessons should
come at 8 pm. or 9 p.m. Begin-
ners should attend the 7 p.m. or
10 p.m. lessons. The cost is $5
per person due at the door. Per-
sons wishing to stay an extra
hour to practice may do so free.

The face behind the FD memorabilia
Junior Schuyler Rideout seeks “W&L spirit” in her FD artwork

By Grattan Brown

Staff Reporter

Shades of green, blue, yellow,
and red have been painted for
you by junior Schuyler Rideout
to depict this year’s Fancy Dress
Ball.

Unlike the posters, cups, and
t—shirts of the past, the
memorabilia featuring the great
Jay Gatsby has been done by a
student. Schuyler’s position as
SAB publicity director has made
her responsible for the
memorabilia design.

She decided to dispense with
the professional graphics once
contracted out tofmns and has
used her skills as a studio art
major to create the memorabilia
design herself. The personal

attention given to this year’s
memorabilia means that one can
find the spirit of Washington and
Lee students in the design.

The project began with the

countless hours spent pouring
over magazines and old movies
created during Gatsby’s
“lifetime,” the roaring twenties.
After spending nearly 40 hours
developing ideas and proposing
them to various committees, she
worked for nearly 15 hours to
finish her acrylic painting. In her
painting, she has tried to escape
the generic, professional designs
of the past and instead to capture
a student’s perspective of this
student event.

The premier social event of
the South, she thinks, should
show the spirit of the place from
which it comes, and she hopes
that in five or ten years, when
one who has attended the ball
looks at the poster, he or she will
remember the time spent in a
gymnasium transformed for just
one night.

Schuyler painted the motifs of
the roaring twenties in bright
colors to catch and delight the
eyes. The jazz music is spread

around the sides of the FD cup,
which features the silhouette of
horn and piano players. Added
to those players on the t-shirt is
the dancing Gatsby, symbolic of
the 1920s frivolity.

The poster draws on the book
itself, as Gatsby and the viewer
find themselves inside the
millionaire‘s mansion. Through
the open French doors, one sees
the city lights behind the
Manhattan skyline, which has
been drawn twice, once in black
and again in green to signify East
and West Egg, the two sections

of New York found in the book._

Underneath it one finds the green
streetlight, symbolizing hope,
which Jay Gatsby sees as he
looks off the end of his pier.
Not to be outdone by a book,
Washington and Lee life is
present in the columns of
Gatsby’s main room, and with a
little imagination, one can
perhaps find several more
indispensable aspects of life at

By Pamela Kelley
Entertainment Editor

In February of 1905 W&L
Librarian Annie Joe White and a
handful of students created Fancy
Dress with 44 extra dollars left
over from theatre production
proceeds. Her intent was to make
the event, a “Bal Masque,” an
annual one. Admission price for
the students was nothing, al-
though the ordered costumes cost
about $2.00. Music was provided
by an orchestra from VMI that
knew all the latest two-steps.
Women of the facultyprovided
refreshments. That was on a
Thursday; the next morning stu-
dents had class.

Her attempt was greeted with
indifference by the students,
however her “Bal Masque“ soon
gained enormous support and
enthusiasm from the entire W&L
community. Each year Fancy
Dress, which was open to the
W&L community, VMI keydets
(which, then, provided about one
fourth of the attendance), and
alumni, grew in popularity and
prestige. By 1919 the extravagant
themes and elaborate decorations
were known throughout the
South. Later, it would be deemed
"the South’s outstanding
collegiate social event," by The
New York Times.

The 1920s, which are being
honored in this year’s theme,
could be considered one of the
“hey-days” for the Fancy Dress
Ball, with thousands of people in
attendance. Many of the high-
lights of that era are still remem-
bered. Elaborate costumes were
ordered from Van Hom‘s, a
company in Philadelphia, and
New York. The ball made its
debut to the nation via Walter
Winchell and the Lucky Strike
Radio Network hookup. The
biggest jazz bands and orchestras
of the day were contracted to
play music for the “ligures”or
dances, like Bennie Goodman,
Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and

Jimmy Dorsey. Hundreds of
young women are said to have
traveled from cities such as New
Orleans, Atlanta, Charleston, and
Baltimore to attend, sometimes
even renting out entire railroad
boxcars. Miss White proudly
continued to attend her enhanced
Bal Masque through the 1930s,
when she was featured in Lzfe
magazine for her accomplish-
ments.

The ball, which was once one
of a series of winter and spring
dances including a Junior Prom,
a Sophomore Cotillion, arid the
long-time favorite Final Ball.
The latter has now eclipsed its
predecessors, which no longer
exist.

Twice, in its 85-year-old
history the tradition of Fancy
Dress has been interrupted, during
the war years in the 19405 and

then it was completely excluded
in 1971 when it was completely
extinguished

However, Fancy Dress could
once again be resurrected to its
former glory. With such themes
as “Mardi Gras," “On Broad-
way,” “The Wizard of Oz,”
“Diamond Jubilee,” and last
year's approximately $100,000
“Evening Excursion on the
Orient Express” the proud
heritage of Fancy Dress has been
restored.

This year’s theme, “Gatsby’s
Great Gala,” promises to visit a
time of lavishness and decadence
that would undoubtedly be in
keeping with the dreams and
ideas of Annie Joe White. Its
opulence promises to return us to
those “Roaring 20s,” the days of
its glory, even if only for a sin-
gle night...

W&L’s Fancy Dress is filled

By Todd Peppers
Staff Reporter

The moment that the student
body has eagerly awaited is upon
us: Washington and Lee's eighty-
third annual Fancy Dress Ball.
What was once labeled by The
New York Times as “the
outstanding collegiate social event
of the south” is only days away.
For freshmen this will be the first
time to experience the biggest
party Washington a.nd Lee offers.
For seniors this year's Fancy
Dress will be steeped in nostagia
as they prepare to leave General
Lee's college. But whether you
are a returning alunmus, a “first-
timer,” or a veteran senior,
Fancy Dress weekend always
proves itself to be a memorable
occasion.

As you have read in the
Fancy Dress Supplement to The
Ring-tum Phi, this year's theme is
“Gatsbv’s Great Gala” This

theme is unlike other balls of our
era since it draws on literary
characters. With “The Great
Gatsby" in mind, we thought it
might be interesting to go back
and survey a few of the more
unusual or elaborate Fancy Dress
Balls.

Who was responsible for
creating the Fancy Dress Ball?
An article in the 1929 edition of
The Ring-tum Phi pegs Miss
Annie White, then librarian at
Washington and Lee, as the
founder of Fancy Dress.

“Forty—four dollars ﬁnanced
the first Washington and Lee
Fancy Dress Ball, held February
22, 1905, in the old gymnasium.
An orchestra knowing all the
latest two-steps came over from
VMI to furnish the syncopation.”

here is some confusion over the
first date of Fancy Dress, with
later editions of the Phi labeling
1907 as the start of this hallowed
tradition. Back to the first Fancy
Dress: White had directed a

student play in order to raise
money for a campus organization.

through the night. But the article
adds that “the University gave no
holiday for such useless affairs as
a Fancy Dress Ball. Students
might dance all night at the
biggest ball of the year with the
understanding, however, that they
return to class at 9 a.m. with

Before the event, White pledged
only a certain amount of money
to the organization. After the
play, she was faced with a
dilemma: they had raised forty-
four dollars above the original
pledge. White decided to use the
extra money to put on a small
dance for the students involved in
the fundraiser.

White sent out invitations to
the Ball with the only stipulation
that those attending had to pay
for their costumes.

In the beginning the school’s
administration was not as tolerant
of Fancy Dress hangovers and
shenanigans. Nor did the
administration entertain the notion
of a dance ninning from
Wednesday night til Sunday

morning. The first dance did last

lessons prepared.”

Those student critics of the
present administration might take
note that, contrary to their claims,
the “Hill” has softened its stance
toward FD in the last seventy
years.

The first Fancy Dress Ball
wasn’t as elaborate as the modern
balls which feature camels,
elephants, train cars, and
spotlights. Our predecessors had
to rough it. The $44 went for
decorations, not a small sun of
money in those days, and
refreshments were provided by
Washington and Lee faculty
wives. The article notes the
costume of choice for the Fancy
Dress Ball of 1905:

“a favorite costume for that

first Fancy Dress Ball was King
Arthur's arrnor——the students
coming to the dance clad in steel
mail from their helmeted head to
their steeled legs. But once was
enough. It cramped their style.”

For decades the idea of a
costume ball remained part of
Fancy Dress. If you have trouble
renting a tuxedo now, consider
this article on the 1919 Fancy
Dress Ball:

“[Participants]...John A. Witt
as Oberon, King of the Faries
[sic] and Miss Cotton Timberlake
as Titania, Queen of the Faries
were drawn in on a chariot
decorated as a lily. The chariot
which was brilliantly lighted by
tiny electric bulbs was drawn by
four faries assisted by court
attendants. I As the chariot

reached the woodland glade the
King and Queen mounted the
throne which was encircled by
court attendants and ladies—in-
waiting with the foresters, wood
nymphs, and butterﬂies seated
among the cedar trees.”

The theme of that year's
Fancy Dress was, of course,
based on William Shakespeare's
“Midsummer Night’s Dream.”
And its theme required more than
black tie. Imagine trying to find
a costume if you were a wood

nymph or the mercurial Puck.
Furthermore, student
participation went beyond garbing
oneself in appropriate costume.
The article adds that “a beautiful
and graceful interpretative dance
[was] given by Miss Minolaw
Gray as Midnight Ballet.” After
this performance the King and
Queen led a march around “a
beautifully decorated May Pole.”
The article from 1919
included a complete list of the
students attending Fancy Dress

Ball. Some of the more
interesting costumes included
B.W. Buford as ‘ ‘a Grecian

Boy,” Miss Virginia Sproull of
Anniston, Alabama as the “W &
L Swing," Miss Ada Tyler of
Sweet Briar as “Balloon Girl,”
and J.L. Glover as “Yama
Ya.ma.” Our Washington and
Lee forefathers failed to provide
future generations with a
discription of a “yama yama”—-
we can only wonder...

By 1929 Fancy Dress had
substantially grown in size. W&L
professor Carl Gill was in charge
of planning the 1929 Fancy
Dress, Miss White was away, but
the format remained unchanged.

“Decorations changed
Doremus gymnasium into the
palace of King Shahryar, rule of
ancient Persia. With an Oriental
theme and classic background, the
ball surpassed by far its famous
predecessors in brilliance and
novelty.”

W&L students still had a
penchant for assuming the garb
of historical ﬁgures. Student
T.G. Gibson transformed himself
into King Shahryar, complete
with a grand throne and a
fawning court. Sophia Dunlap

was cast in the role of Sultana
Sheherazade and “was brought
before the ruler on a litter borne
by four Nubain slaves. Dunlap, in
the guise of Sheherazade, dazzled
the King with her famous stories
of Ali Baba and ‘The Shipwreck

of Sinbad’...A group of costumed
dancers interpreted her stories”'

Ironically, one element stays
constant down through the years:
the contraversy that perpetually
swirls around those organizing
and running the ball. In the
January 17, 1936 edition of The
Ring-tum Phi, Glenn Shively,
president of Fancy Dress
Committee, responded angrily to
an earlier student letter which
bemoaned the rising prices of
costumes. Shively wrote that two
costumers offered to furnish
Fancy Dress costumes for the
price of $2.40 per costume.

“The committee felt justified
in charging the additional 60

cents to take care of losses or
damages to the costumes, and
any profit that might be made
was to go to the Fancy Dress

Fun .” Apparently the earlier
letter suggested that the
extravagent profits might be

going elsewhere, and Shively
only wanted to set the record
straight.

Lgeigh Society

 

Perhaps higher prices were in
order since the ball that year was
quite elaborate. The theme
centered on the return of the Earl
of Essex from the sacking of the
Spanish town of Cadiz. When
Essex arrived back to England,
Queen Elizabeth declared a
national Thanksgiving. Fancy
Dress revolved around “a replica
of the reception in the royal
palace...the elaborate costumes
and scenery will be representative
of the Elizabethan period.”

Sadly for the 1936 Fancy
Dress, neither the National
Broadcasting Company nor the
Columbia Broadcasting System
carried the dance. But, luckily
for W&L students, there were the
watchful eyes of chaperons. The
list included Mrs. Francis P.
Gaines, Mrs. R.H. Tucker, Mrs.
F.J. Gilliam, and Mrs. Cy Young-
-an imposing list in the eyes of
those fine young Washington and
Lee gentlemen who wanted to
“blow off a little steam" during
the dance.

By 1950, the founders of

Fancy Dress had forgotten the
earlier wamings against heavy
suits of armor and settled on the
theme of King Arthur and the
legendary Round Table. The
decorations in the gymnasium
began to approach their modern
day opulence. Doremus was
“transformed into a remarkable
replica of a medieval
castle...complete with battlements,
turrets, and a working
drawbridge.” And, for the first

time since the earliest dances,
students decorated the gym
instead of hiring a professional
company. The “premiere social
event of the south” drew more
than a thousand people dressed as
peasants, armor bearers, knights
and maidens. The article doesn’t
say whether the students, like
their predecessors, discovered the
suits of armor cumbersome.

In 1956, FD moved away
from the historical themes of past
years and embraced “the
fantastique" with “The Wizard

of Oz."
Gone were the magestic
ﬁgures of King Arthur, Lord
Essex, and Titania; Doremus gym
was ﬂm ieri with happy
Munchkins, wicked witches, and
kindly wizards. Fancy Dress
chairmen assumed the roles of
the Scarecrow, the Cowardly
Lion, and the Tin Woodman.
Revelers walked through the
famrhouse of Dorothy, down the
famous yellow brick road, and
into the throneroom of the great
and powerful 02. Les Elgart and
his orchestra provided the music
for the occasion. The article
doesn't mention how many times
the audience endured the song
“Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”
FD has always been a

reﬂection of the changing society
around us. In the early years, the
emphasis was placed on historical
characters and events. In the
l940’s and l950’s the focus was
on more “light-hearted themes”
of the rich and famous. In 1969,
indicating the turbulant events of

the decade, Fancy Dress
underwent one of its most
dramatic changes.

The 1969 ball boasted
“psychedelic music and a
professional light show.” Gone

were the lavish balls and exotic
themes; the Fancy Dress
Committee offered the languid
theme of “An Inauguration
Ball.” Why languid? Well the
inauguration wasn’t in honor of a
former United States president, or
a mythical Egytian tyrant, but
rather for new Washington and
Lee President Robert Huntley.
The Saturday night concert
boasted a separate theme from
the stogy Inauguration: “Love—In
69.” Musical entertainment was
provided by the Kallabash
Corporation and Fever Tree. The
Ring-tum Phi recommended that

“conventional dress" be
abandoned and “appropriate
dress” should be substituted.
Apparently the student body

deemed it m.m....."-.. -»

 

their tuxedos for tie-dye.

But the greatest blow came in
1971 when FD was temporarily
suspended. The chairman of the
Dance Board informed the EC
that there would not be a ball
“because of a greatly reduced
budget and past history of student
disinterest.” A heart-broken
alumnus wrote that “for the old
grad from General Lee’s college
it is the most shattering break
with the past since the Generals
dropped out of big time
football.”

The March 10, 1971 edition
of The Ring-tum Phi asked the

question ‘ ‘Can Fancy Dress
Return? ’ ’ The question was
thankfully ‘ ‘yes,’ ’ but those

Board saw a new, improved
Fancy Dress in the future. Was
this to be a “kinder, gentler”
FD?

“The cost is the inhibitive
thing," said the Dance Board
Chairman, “I don't want to
spend more than $2,500 to
$3,000 on the thing.”

He added that “my
philosophy is to bring it (FD)
back, but perhaps on a different
format. I don't want...Glenn
Miller. They won’t attract
enough people.”

His solution: the 1972 Fancy
Dress was a 50’s revival party
with people paying $5.00 to hear
the ShaNaNa. Miss White would
have been horriﬁed. No black
tie? No dance band? No
beautiful decorations in the gym?

But Fancy Dress would rise
again. By the mid 1970's FD had
returned to its roots as the finest
party in the South.

Fancy Dress 1976 offered the
theme “A Salute to Hollywood.”
In perhaps a slightly mocking
tone, the Phi noted that the
festival was kicked off Thursday
night in the “simply yet elegantly
decorated Zollman’s Pavilion."
There are many ways to describe
Zollman’s Pavilion, but quiet

ICN Y

Unlike earlier years, the main
dance was held in Fairfax
Lounge, Evans Dining Hall, and
the Cockpit (since renamed t he
General Headquarters with the
advent of cooeducation).

The entrance to Fairfax
Lounge bore a “ﬂashing
Hollywood—type theater marquee,
open wide to admit the first
lucky couple.”

One student hoped that “all
gentlemen attending will display
the proper attire of black tie.” If
not, the burly and altogether
unpleasant doorman may be
tempted to violence."

Evans Dining Hall was filled
with the sounds of the Fabulous
Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra, while
Room 144 was decorated as an
old theater and offered newsreels,
cartoons, and “with luck, dim
lights.” Even the Executive
Committee got into the act: “the
fabled EC room, scene of many
memorable scenes, will unstuff
itself long enough to permit
continuous showing of ...‘That’s
Entertainment.‘ ’ ’

VENICE

World-renown hyptomist
Edwin L Baron, director of the
Hypnotist Institute of Chicago,
was present to hypnotize
voluntary subjects into “gobbling
imaginary watermelon."

Finally, to thoroughly test the
mettle of W&L students, a party
was sponsored by the Freshman
class during Saturday afternoon.
The party might have given birth
to the headline that graced the

1976 Fancy Dress edition of the

Ring-tum Phi--“Fancy Dress
Weekend arrives; University
braces for hangover." One
might pen a more poetic

headline, but none more realistic.

This ends our brief foray into
FD’s past. With the theme
“Gatsby’s Great Gala,” we will
stay faithful to the lavish
decorations and beautiful music
that would have made Miss
White proud. Enjoy the eighty-
third annual Fancy Dress Ball.
And remember that when you
leave Doremus gym on Friday
night, ‘Gatsby’s Great Gala”
become part of Fancy Dress yore.

As Fancy Dress approaches, 1
try to recall every little bit of
information that I have heard
about this weekend extravaganza.
The varied references to FD must
be sorted out before I can even
begin to evaluate what my
feelings are about the event.

The first time I ever heard
about FD was during a tour one

year ago. The tour guide was
explaining the basic party
structure at W&L: big parties

every Wednesday, Friday and
Saturday, with the ever occasional
party on Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, or Thursday. She
concluded by mentioning that she
had one of the best times of her
life during Fancy Dress weekend,
which sounded to me like a party
not to be missed. I, of course,
considered her overwhelming
praise of the event to be a sales
pitch to get me to come to
W&L, so I didn't give it another
thought.
That idea changed, however,
when I read in one of those
“choose your college” books.
The books said that Fancy Dress
is one of the biggest
extravaganzas on the east coast -
a party not to be missed.
Needless to say, I decided to
attend W&L, not because of
Fancy Dress, well, at least not
only because of Fancy Dress.

Looking forward, looking back
Freshman

Even during Fraternity Rush,
Fancy Dress was a topic brought
up by many houses. The stories

I heard described Fancy Dress as’

the weekend, the party of the
academic year. Fancy Dress talk

finally subsided as there were_

other parties and other events to
apply one’s full attention to.

At the beginning of winter
term, however, the stories were
revived. I had already found that
talking to upperclassmen helped
me in most other areas of college
life, so I decided to find out
what FD is all about from the
supposed veterans. Some were
more of a help than others while
most were no help at all.

One upperclassman’s
contribution was, "It's great, it's
the best, I can’t explain it to you,
it has to be experienced".
Wonderful, what a great help.

A sophomore who tried to
offer his sage advice preached
that Fancy Dress was the greatest
time‘ of his life. Another
sophomoric ‘ ‘prophet’ ’ concluded
that Fancy Dress was the worst

time of his life. Great. What do
I do now? Luckily, an “all—
Icnowing” senior helped me out,
“It depends upon the girl you
take.” Ahhh! This made sense,
obviously the amount of fun you
have is directly proportional to
the quality of your date. I thus
concluded that in order to have a
great time at FD I should have
the perfect date. No problem.
Well maybe, but I'll work that

It was a year ago next week.
I was a freshmen and I didn’t
have a Fancy Dress date. For
days, I watched and listened as
the girls on my hall ran around
trying on dresses, giggling about
dates and thinking aloud about
how wonderful the weekend was
going to be. Meanwhile, I sat on
my bed in my room, cooped up,
nothing to join in with, looking
aheadlto a weekend of being left
out.

After a while, it got quiet and
I started to think. Wait a minute,
I thought. I want to have a good
time. And I'm going to.

So I took off from the fresh-
men dorms for the pavilion.

Most people were already at the
pavilion so no one was around as
I walked in the dark, past the
gym, across the bridge and down
the law school steps. I got all
the way to a road block between
the ‘law school parking lot and
the road leading up to the pavil-
ion before I bumped into anyone.

When I got up to the road
blocks, two junior guys were
working security, moving the
barricades when cars needed to
get through. I knew a little
about one of the guys and he
knew my name.

From his point of view, that
was all we knew about each
other. Little did he know, like a
lot.of women at W&L, I knew
he was and still is a really amaz-
ing guy. Handsome and smart,
good-natured and down-to-earth,

out later.

As I continued to investigate
this too-good—to—be—true weekend,
I discovered the “man behind the
curtain," or rather the mighty
dollars role in this unbelievable
event. I believe I recall one
upperc1assman’s comments to be
something to this effect, “FD,
what a great time! I've never
had less money after any event in
my life.” Wait. No money?
How can this be? I had visions
of the W&L man walking on the
Colonnade in his khaki pants and
blue oxford button down before
FD and walking around in rags
following the weekend's
festivities. “Sure people go into
debt, but hey, FD is worth it,"
was my answer. Okay, I can
deal with being a debtor, as long
as everyone else at school is too.

'lhe next strange-but-true
fact about FD that I uncovered
was that W&L gentlemen do not
ask women to FD, they give out
“bids.” I couldn't help but
laugh at this because I thought it
was ludicrous. This isn't Rush,
this is FD. You're notjpicking a
pledge, your selecting it date. I
asked myself, “what — do these
guys do, have ball-sessions over
women?” The answer, as I
myself discovered, is yes. I
found myself checking out
possibilities with friends and
friends asking me what I thought
about so and so. In our own
way, we were conducting private
ball sessions, and any woman

Fancy Dress... Ever since the
first day I set foot on this
campus at the start of my
freshman year, the legend of the
“great social event of the
collegiate South" was told to me
through the stories of numerous
upperclassmen. They all said one
thing: “You’ll never forget it.”
They were right, and now every
time I look at the scar on my
right wrist, I'll remember my
freshman year FD.

It all started when I asked my
date, a mutual friend of a pledge
brother and myself. She agreed

to go, and the whole weekend we ,
had a fabulous time, though I felt -
. ._. -.as_ if she really wanted-to be with

who could survive surely
deserved more than an invitation,
give that woman a bid!

Another misconception
concerning Fancy Dress is that it
is a weekend affair. Not so.
Often times FD week commences
with a Sunday night party to
welcome the arrival of yet
another Fancy Dress. I also
discovered that those unfortunate
gentlemen among us who have
not yet given out a ‘bid’ (or have
not had one accepted) can stop
into The Pit and find a damsel in
distress, or rather a babe without
a bid the Wednesday before FD
officially begins.

One last bit of information

that I discovered is that the
secretive FD theme is kept secret
because Fancy Dress is more
surprising and enjoyable when
one experiences the unexpected.
Most upperclassmen say it is
better not to know, besides, the
S.A.B. people only love to tease
you with the information that
they have and you don't.

Well, I tried to find out
what FD was all about, but I
really wound up with more
questions than answers. Maybe
that one, unhelpful upperclassmen
was right. Maybe the freshmen,
who obviously know nothing, just
have to experience Fancy Dress.
This is one kriowledgeless
freshman who is willing and able
to have the best time of his life
during Fancy Dress.

my pledge brother. Nonetheless,
we went to my house's pre-ball
party the night of the ball, and
proceeded to drink the free-
ﬂowing champagne. With what
I thought was the “perfect
buzz,” we walked to the
gymnasium. It seemed a shame
to even call it a gym, as the
decorations from the cities the
Orient Express visits enveloped
the whole building, transforming
the place into something much
too classy to warrant saying
“F.D. is in our gym." '

lmrnediately, I took my datei

to see the railroad crossing gates
that stood at the entrance to
Doremus gym, which I had
helped create. At FD, you can
always tell who is on the SAB,
because they are the ones going
around pointing to the most
random things and saying, “I

It is difficult to know what to
anticipate for Fancy Dress
because it is all so secretive.
However, I can already sense the
excitement. Since the Sunday
after Washington Holiday the
girls in my dorm have been
unveiling their dresses and
stressing about dates.

Having both a dress and date,
my biggest concern is
remembering how to ballroom
dance. I learned the box step in
seventh grade, but I
remember much more than that!

This year's FD theme still
remains a mystery to me, but I
am excited to see the gym
decorated. Everyone says I
won't recognize it. Also, it will
be fun to see everyone so dressed
up. I probably won’t recognize
some of my friends either.

Invariably, everyone says FD
is the weekend of the year. I'm
really looking forward to going.
I’m sure it will be wonderful
after all the planning and hard
work that has gone into this one
weekend.

The advice upperclassmen
have given me is, “Get your
work done ahead of time,
because you will be going out
and catching up on sleep from
next Wednesday night to
Sunday."

painted (built, designed) that."
Needless to say, I was very
proud of the gates that took a
fraternity brother and myself,
being the carpenters we were,
three days to make stand on their
own. Luckily, my oh—so-
impressed date did not see the
concrete blocks that we finally

jhad to put on the base of the

gates to keep them from falling
over.

After admiring them for a few
minutes, my date pulled me into
the Warner Center where the
swing band was playing
“Pennsylvania 6500.” We
danced and danced, and between
songs, some of my pledge
brothers and I went to the
refreshment stand. isn't it funny

Junior

By Mary Stanton

Fancy Dress is a time when
people from all over the country
come to take part in the
marathon party weekend that has
been a tradition for years at
Washington and Lee.

As a freshman at W&L,
Fancy Dress became quite an
ordeal for me and many of my
friends. Talk about it began way
before February break rolled
around. I can remember trying
to relax and sunbathe on a
faraway Mexican beach while my
stomach churned at the prospect
of getting a date. The five other
freshman girls who traveled with
me made it incredibly difficult
to forget the dilemma.

As soon as we returned from
break - the race was on! Parties
were unbearably crowded. Girls
crawled out of the woodwork, all
bunking for the FD bid. Every
one of them (including myself)
was looking for the man of their
dreams to invite them to the
famous weekend.

As a freshman the whole
thing seemed so mystical, we had
no ideal what it would be like.
We had made the ball in to such
a huge sensation in our minds,
that there was no way it could
really measure up. All we knew
was that we had to go, preferably
with someone wonderful.

The Wednesday night after
break was the night for me. I
was dancing at a party at a
fraternity house when I saw him.

I would like to begin by
welcoming one and all to FD
season. If you haven't noticed,
the tell-tale signs are all over
campus; hundreds of terror
stricken male faces in search of
that perfect date or, in many
cases, a date with a pulse. There
are also you women out there
hoping that an illusive “bid" will
find you or at least a severe case
of the mumps or mono so that
you can say with pride, “I could
have gone, but...!". Of course
it is inevitable that our professors
will schedule tests as close to
March 9 just to add to the
tension of the season. _ In fact, I
hear that there is a "Porter
Rally" scheduled for 10:00 P.M,

will be a beer garden. And last,

The Ring-tum Phl Fancy Dress Supplement, March 1, 1990

It was that junior I thought hung
the moon. I had been looking at
him all year long. Feeling
especially courageous that
evening, I dragged him out onto
the dance floor and we danced
the rest of the night.

The next morning when I
awoke, the first question that ran
through my mind was, “Do I
have a date for FD yet?” After
talking with me friends about the
evening, I remembered. He had
asked me!

I had a great time that year at
FD - the weather was great, the
bands were fun, and it was all so
new to me. Last year's FD was
fun, but in a different way. I
was not as uptight about things
since I knew more of what to
expect. Of course there was a

different theme but the Schedule

was basically the same.

The Saturday afternoon parties
were the highlights for me.
Seeing alums and watching their
pranks was quite entertaining.
My freshmen year, bicycles were
swung from a fraternity ﬁre
escape over the band's heads.
Last year, people listening to
great music, eating crawﬁsh, and
enjoying a few too many
cocktails were lassoed by
pranksters on this same fire
escape.

This year, I am trying not to
think about FD yet. We'll see
what happens...In the meantime,
good luck to everyone and try to
avoid: A) getting arrested; B)
passing out before any scheduled
activities; and C) slapping, biting,
scratching, spitting on, or leaving
your date.

there is the ever present inﬂux of
“Road Cheese" (no offense
ladies) from the five institutions
of higher learning all over
southwestern VA. All will be
primed to say “yes" to almost
any request in the hopes that it
might lead to something much
bigger.

Anyway, as a Senior I am
proud to say that I will have
spent well over $1,000.00 total in
the last four years to be a part of
the biggest party in the South.
Some may say that's a lot of
money. In fact, I'll say it,
“That's a lot of money!!!" But
lets face it, we would have used
that money on beer anyway.

_It's quite amazing to look
back on your three previous H)‘s
when you are a senior. I was

one of the masses freshman year.
I handed out my “bid" to a girl
down the road. Let me say to
all you doubters~‘out there that if
he/she is willing to lie and is
hotter than anyone else’s date,

 

By J.R. Smith
Junior

You know. . .it's almost like
two different worlds. I mean
think about it, and then laugh. .
.cause there are plenty of
differences between men and
women regarding how they deal
with Fancy Dress.

To begin——WOMEN.

WEIGHT: Sure, athletics
and fitness is in, but its pretty
peculiar that more and more these
last few weeks women have been
pedaling those stationary bike
contraptions as if they were
trying to get out of Hell.

DRESS: Now maybe this
should have come before the first
category, because the first thing
that women really think is "Oh
gee, just how am I going to fit
into that dress?" And lets just
settle this issue now. . .Just how
many months does it take to find
the dress? NO. Not just any

dress...THE DRESS!!!.
And now please. No sane person
really cares if my cummerbund
matches the little bows on your
shoes or not!

COMPETITION: I
happened to be sitting outside of
the co-op before break when the
temperature was in the 70s.
Fortunately for me I sat near a
table of six or so women. They
were gabbing loudly (some things
never change). The conversation
kind of went like this:

GIRL #l"Well, who are you

there is absolutely nothing wrong
with taking your cousin to FD.
Seriously though, I had a great
time with a girl from D.C. I
only wish I could remember her
narne!!

Sophomore year was, well...
I don't know how to say it. To
put it as tactfully as possible, “It
was Hell!!!" I am proud to say
that I had a date from Thursday
to Sunday, unfortunately, or now
in retrospect, thankfully, come
Sunday morning I was with
someone different. Yes, I
utilized the famous “date
swapping technique" which has
been a W&L favorite used by us
(hu-hurn) gentlemen for nearly a
century now. The key is to
dump or get dumped as soon as
you can so that you willhave the
time to search for a another
“dumpee." FD is traditionally.
one of the biggest relationship-
ending weekends of the year.
My advice is to drink, drink, and

going to FD with?"

GIRL #2 "I'm going with
my boyfriend. He hasn't asked
me yet, but I think he's just
really fab. Imean, I k n o w
things have been a little rocky
lately, but we always work things
out. Let's be for real, we are II:
perfect couple. Who are you
going with," she asks slyly,
knowing full well thatthls girl
doesn't do too well with the
other gender.

GIRL #3"Well, I have a date,
but you wouldn't know him."

GIRL #2"0h now please. . .I
know everyone."

GIRL #3"No, really."

GIRL #2"Now this is
ridiculous! Don't be shy! Who
is your date?"

GIRL #3"If you must know,
I'm going to the biggest social
event of the year with your EX-
boyfriend. He said you would
understand," she says with a
smile knowing that she has just

lost her best friend for three
years, but she has an FD date!

THE DATE: Now this is a
touchy subject. I have seen
women do some pretty weird
things to try to get a date. The
Wednesday night parties the week
of FD are a prime example.
These parties are more crowded,
packed, and jammed full of
women than any other
Wednesday night parties ever.
Conversations at these parties are
a lot like boomerangs, they all
come back to FD and getting a
date.

By Wendy Wolford
Senior

I can't believe Fancy Dress is
almost here! Whoever hasn't
been hasn't lived. FD is truly an
event that every college student
dreams of. . .four days of fun,
excitement and parties. I just
wish this year's FD weren't my
last.

It seems like yesterday that I
walked past an elephant into the
Warner Center and found myself
in a jungle complete with a
wandering gorilla. What a

.magical evening that was. The

decorations were incredible, the
bands were fabulous (I still listen
to the Hoodoo Gurus religiously)
and I couldn't have had a better

.date. ‘I had no idea that Fancy

Dress was such a big deal.
Although FD my sophomore

year was a blast,’it wasn't as

perfect as the previous one. The

MEN.

WEIGHT: The topic of
weight is a funny thing with
men. We get up in the

,mornings, smile with a deep

sense of pride at ‘our bulging
stomachs, and then head for the

:fridge to add another beer to the

load. It happens like clockwork.

DRESS: Even though we'd
rather go to the ball in jeans,
most of us are civilized enough
to rent or buy a tux. If your
date is cute, a friend, or from
W&L, you definitely buy her
some type of ﬂora! arrangement
to be worn above the waist. If
you really like your date and
want to impress her. . .have a
curnrnerbund that matches the
bows on her shoes. She will
definitely notice and thank you
for caring.

THE DATE: Again, men
don't worry about dates.
However there is one thing that
we do worry very much about...

MONEY!!!: This is a big
one. No other event in the entire
school year sucks more money

out of your pockets than FD.
Before you can even blink,
you've bought or rented a tux,
paid for a corsage, had dinner at
an over priced restaurant, picked-
up some FD tickets, drunk your
FD champagne (man that killer
buzz is rockin’ now!), and
purchased every possible
paraphernalia or souvenir thought
possible. What does that add up
too? BIG BUCI(S!!

week before the big event found
me dateless and frightened.
However, once I got the “bid,"
(a term I detest'but'fca‘n't find a
synonym for) I forgot about the
anxiety I faced when all of my
roommates but me had dates --
that is until the night of the ball
when I saw a fellow classmate
wearing my dress. How could
there have been two dresses that
the salesclerk had termed “one of
a kind?"

However, that was nothing
compared to last year. Beware
of Iaegermeister! The ball was
tons of fun for me, but somehow
I left my date to dance the night
away with one of his good
friends. Fortunately we worked
things out ‘after the dance or I
wouldn't be going with him again
this year.

Although each year has been
unique, all three FD‘s rank in the
top of 10 of my fun times at
W&L. Despite the adventures of

What the fraternities

are up to FD weekend

 

By Pat Lopes
Assignment Editor

Wondering what's going on at
the fraternities and sororities for
Fancy Dress weekend?

Band parties are set at every
fraternity for Saturday. Most
parties are closed to the general
student body so check with a
brother before you try to crash a
party. Plans are still up in the
air for cocktail parties, house
dimers and champagne break-
fasts, but just about everyone is
trying to put something together.
Check with social chairmen later
this week or next week, when
most of the plans will be firmed
up.

This year, sororities are also
jumping into the festivities. All
three sororities are taking Thurs-
day night before the concert to
get members and dates for pre-
concert dining.

Here’s a look at what all six-
teen fraternities and three sorori-
ties are up to..

everyone thinks already has a

“Where’s your date?” he
asked.

“Well, I don't have one,” I
answered.

He couldn't believe it. He
wanted to know why I didn’t
have a date and all I could say
was Ijust didn’t get asked.

He asked me. I didn't know
what to say. Here we were,
standing in the middle of the

leaning on zebra-striped road
blocks and this not-just-any guy
was asking me to FD. After he
was done working his shift at the
road block, he came up to the

me around to meet all his friends.

to get a flower for him. Class,
work, lacrosse practice. I was

made the dance so much fun
without explaining all the little
things he did for me. He just
paid so much attention to me that
he completely destroyed the fact
that I felt so awful a day ago for
not being asked.

So let me just say freshmen
ye.a:, you see the pictures, you
‘..tear the stories, you spend
months [wondering if you’re going
to get a date and wondering what
the weekend is really like. After
it’s all over, everyone has their
own stories, most not even re-
motely similar to mine in mood.

But as for myself, my Fancy
Dress weekend seemed like a
fairy tale set in the land of
Washington and Lee.

brown color and smell something
like Jim Beam?

At the fireworks show, I
noticed that my curnmerbund had
decided to leave my body. But,
it was the party night of the year,
and I was not going to worry my
now—closer-to-sober date about
my fleeing cummerbund.

The next morning, I awoke
with a small pain on my right
wrist. It looked as if something
bit me. At the inﬁrmary the lady
looked at it and immediately
recognized it as a cigar bum.
Someone had practically
extinguished their cigar on my
wrist at some point in the
evening. The nurse asked how

much I drank. Not nearly as
much as it seems, I replied.

Before I got nervous about not
remembering large parts of the
ball, she assured me that you
don't always feel burns if you
don’t see them happen. I felt as
if she said that just to make me
feel better about my “perfect
buzz.”

After two more parties on
Saturday, FD was over. To close
my story, I now have a scar that
some say is shaped like the
Orient Express on my right hand
that will always remind me of
FD and that my Mother will
always believe was part of some
“fratemity/pledge thing.” I
recovered my cummerbund from
someone who was keeping it for
a souvenir, and my date later
dated our mutual friend for a
while.

drink some more, for the pain of
a relationship gone sour could
never come close to the hangover
you'll have Sunday, Monday, and
maybe even Tuesday.
My junior year provided me
with some memories that I will
never lose. To sum up my
experience, “Never has one spent
so much to do so little.” As a
prelude to this little tale, I offer
up some wamings: Warning #1 -
Men out there, do not let your
date pop a Benedryl and
subsequently offer them a drink.
If I continue with this story I
will first be censored and second,
I will be purnmelled to death in
my sleep tonight. Let’ just say
we never made it to the Ball.
Warning #2 - If you happen to

ignore “waming #1” make sure
you don't leave anything back at
the room. I'll let you fill in the
rest. In short, we never get to
FD. Probably the funniest
moments came when I was asked
what we thought of the Ball.
My date and I had planned out
our answer. At my Fratemity’s
band party the next evening with
every question came the answer
in stereo, “The decorations were
fantastic, the music was
wonderful, and the fireworks
were marvelous.” Even funnier
was Monday at work-study when
Coach Miller said, “I enjoyed
talking to you and your lovely
date Friday night, it looked as if
you were having a great time.”
Laughing hysterically to myself I

answered, “The decorations were
fantastic....”

Well, now I am a senior and
I am going with the same girl as
last year. As an act of
precaution, I have removed all
antihistamines from her medicine
cabinet. I am totally prepared.
I have invested in dance lessons
so that I know when to rumba,
samba, jitterbug or waltz.
However, I will probably be
riding one heck of a buzz
(caffeine of course) by the time I
get to the Ball, so you may see
me doing my usual dance in
which I hang all over my
girlfriend. For those who know
me, you know what I am saying.

Before I close I have a

piece of advice for you guys out
there. If you have a tight
budget, you may want to invest
in a long term relationship during
your junior year so that by the
time FD rolls around senior year
the possibilities of going
“Dutch” are that much better.
Just some food for thought.

I hope for this to be the‘

best FD yet. Actually, we'd be
happy to make it in the front
door of Doremus. In all
seriousness, I have the best date
I could ever ask for and I know
March 8-11 will be the greatest
weekend of my life. I wish
everyone all the best this FD
season for it is truly the party to
end all parties.

finding a date, not to mention a
dress, everything has always
worked out in the end. Once the
doors open and the music begins,
I race around wildly to see what
incredible changes the SAB has
made to the gym. The
excitement of seeing all of my
friends (only half of whom I
remember) and finding out whom
they are with is the one of the
best parts.

But once the excitement of
Friday night fades away, there’s
no time to get depressed, for FD
Saturday is an event in itself.
After two nights of dancing and
socializing there’s still one more

night of fun before the reality of
Monday morning sets in.

VOLUME 89, NO. 20

By Tyler Suiters
Staff Reporter

David Howison, dean of student
affairs at St. Lawrence University,
has been named Washington and
Lee’s next dean of students.

“Dean Howison brings to Wash-
ington and Lee a wealth of experi-
ence in working with students,” said
President John Wilson. “We are all
gratified to learn that he has accepted
our invitation."

Howison will replace Lewis John,
who will begin teaching full-time.

Howison, who has been at St.
Lawrence since 1968, said he decided
to leave the New York university

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

because of the nature of Washington
and Lee.

“There are very few schools in
the U.S. that could convince me to
leave St. Lawrence," Howison said.
“But this is an opportunity I am
excited to accept.”

Howison, who is a member of the
Sigma Chi Fraternity and an alumnus
of Ohio Wesleyan, said he is a strong
supporter of the fraternity system.

“At every institution I’ve been
involved with, I've seen the positive
aspects of fraternities,” Howison said.
“I’m committed to the system, as is
W&L.”

Wilson said Howison played an
important role in St. Lawrence’s
program to improve fraternity life.

“He has a full appreciation of the
fraternity system and will be an ac-
tive ally for students and alumni,”
said Wilson. “He is enthusiastic
about our decision to renovate the
fraternities."

St. Lawrence Student Body Vice
President Ramsey Goodrich said
Howison is pro-fratemity. “He sup-
ports the fraternity system in every
way.”

Goodrich said Howison is also a
fantastic administrator.

“He is in touch with the
students,” added Goodrich. “He is
not just in the administration build-
ing, but out on the campus.”

Wilson said after he met How-
ison, he was not surprised to learn

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

St. Lawrence’s Howison to succee

the search committee unanimously
recommended Howison for the vacan-
cy. He described Howison as calm,
measured and intelligent. “He thinks
before he speaks._”

“He has a great deal of experi-
ence,” continued Wilson. “His values
have been shaped in institutions with
similar commitments as ours.”

Howison said he is honored and
proud to join the’Washington and Lee
administration.

“Everyone I met at W&L was
first rate,” Howison said. “I was
tremendously impressed. The quality
of academics and the tradition make
it very special.”

Howison earned a bachelor’s de-
gree at Ohio Wesleyan, a master’s at

Miami University and a doctorate in
education at Indiana University. He
served as residence hall director and
freshman advisor at Miami University
for three years before he joined St.
Lawrence.

Howison, who has taught several
courses in Sports Culture, said he has
noticed parallels between the athletic
programs at St. Lawrence and W&L.

“Sports are critical to a liberal
education,” said Howison. “At both
schools, athletics and student support
are essential.”

Howison, who has two teenage
children, said he is not sure when he
and his family will move to Lexing-
ton, but he is “looking forward to
coming South."

The Washington and Lee faculty
Monday voted down a proposal to
give the Panhellenic Association full
voting privileges on the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

SAC, according to the Student
Handbook, has “authority for all non-
curricular matters affecting student
life” at W&L.

PHC had proposed that a fourth
faculty member be added to the com-
mittee, andthat two of the faculty
members be elected every other year
to two—year terms.

Under the present format, one
SAC faculty member is elected each
year for a three-year term.

The committee is currently chaired
by Dean of Students Lewis John. The
other members are Associate Dean of
Students Leroy “Buddy” Atkins,
Prof. Robert de Maria, Prof. Kathy
Koberstein, Prof. Lisa Alty, EC Presi-
dent Willard Dumas, Interfratemity
Council President Kevin Nash, Stu-
dent Conduct Committee President
Brandon Canaday, Head Dormitory
Counselor Mary Alice McM0rrow,
and Student Bar Association President
John Falk.

of W&L‘s undergraduate women, is
represented on SAC by President

New zoning law may take effect July 1

By Chuck Broll
Staff Reporter

Any Lexington landlord whose tennants
include more than four unrelated persons will
have to meet more stringent rules and will need
a conditional use by July 1, the Lexington
Plarming Commission voted last week.

The new restrictions,, which must be ap-
proved by City Council, limit residents to three
convictions for noise and litter violations an-
nually. The new rules would also require land-
logds to provide “deﬁned and surfaced” park-
ing and to give neighbors their tennants’ names
and information about their vehicles.

The new rules, if approved by council, will
apply only to houses with five to eight stu-

dents, since the commission decided on a limit
of no more than eight students living in the
same residence. The permits would be reviewed
every five years, at which time the commission
could deny renewal.

The commission said police convictions, not
complaints, would apply for a 12-month period,
beginning June 1 every year. In houses receiv-
ing more than three police convictions in one
year, the “extra” students allowed under the
conditional use permit might be evicted and the
permit would be “subject to revocation” by
the commission.

Comments favoring the new rules were
voiced by Susan LaRue, co—chairman of Thresh-
old, and City Council member A.C. “Sonny”
Jordan at a Feb. 15 commission meeting.

“Our concern is these are houses that were

Wilson considers request
for list of student cars

By James Lake
Asociate Editor

Washington and Lee President John Wilson
said he is still considering how the school will
respond to Lexington’s latest effort to students
for owning automobiles.

Wilson last month received a letter from
City Manager Joseph King, asking for a list of
students who own cars. King wants the list so
Commissioner of Revenue Courtney Baker can
more easily collect Lexington’s personal proper-
ty tax.

“There are a number of things I want to
take fully into account,” Wilson said. On the
one hand, W&L does not want to be accused of
obstructing the city’s efforts to collect a lawful
tax. But, Wilson said, “There are many nega-
tive factors associated with [collecting the
tax].”

Among those factors, Wilson said, are
worries that collecting the tax would encourage

Law Students examine tax issue
 see page 4

students to live in the county or to refuse to
register their cars with the university.

Also, Wilson said the school doesn't “want
to violate the understanding we have with
students about how their records are kept."

According to W&L‘s Student Handbook,
federal law allows schools to release only
“directory information” from a student's files
without his permission. That includes a stu-
dent’s address, telephone number, place of birth,
major, activities, degrees awarded and, in the
case of athletes, height and weight.

Under normal circumstances, only the stu-
dent and a school employee “who has a legiti-
mate interest in reviewing such materials” can
have access to additional information, the
handbook says.

families. They have now been bought and
renovated to house W&L students," LaRue
said. She said her hope was that the new
restrictions would help to make the tennants
become “good neighbors.” H

Jordan, asking the commission if they had
driven through the “Diamond Hill” area recent-
ly, then asked the commission if they would
like to have any of the large student residen-
ces as their neighbors. Jordan was given a
“no” reply by many commission members.

Jordan said the buying up of the residences
on Diamond, Randolph and Massie Streets has
forced many low—income families to move to
Willow Springs, where they are now on wel-
fare because of excess travel expenses between
Lexington and Willow Springs.

Hearing set
for Master Plan

Approval of Washington and Lee’s
Master Plan is “in the ﬁnal stages”
City Manager Joe King said at the Plan-
ning Commission meeting last week.

The commission and City Council
have set a joint public hearing on the
zoning issues for 8 pm. on March 29.

But King said legal work has not
begun for consideration of whether the
city should extend W&L‘s institutional
zone to include the fraternity houses.

OPINION

FD: less spending,
more headaches

Once again, ’tis the Fancy Dress season. (It’s always easy
to tell when ’tis the season, because students look a lot more
well-groomed at parties than ususal). With the season comes
the budgeting and accounting headache for the Student
Activities Board treasurer and FD auditor.

Last year, as we all know, was a financial disaster. First,
the decorations chairmen were assigned, rather than chosen.
People who showed more than a casual interest in a certain
arena of the big or little gym were made chairmen. They
were given no budget. They were not made to order
anything ahead of time, although they were advised to do so.

As a result, many things were bought as they were
needed — on the SAB’s charge accounts. It was amazing
how almost every establishment in Rockbridge County was
signed up for an SAB charge. If you needed something, you
didn’t ask anyone if you could go purchase it; you didn’t
tell anyone you were going to purchase it; you just went.

Last year no one was in charge of the accounting, so
eventually people who were sent on errands just threw
receipts away. It was thus not at all surprising that when fall
came bills for untold amounts were still pouring in.

This year the situation was reversed. The decorations
chairmen were made to apply for the positions. Each
chairman was given a strict budget. Each chairman had to
order everything he could before Christmas vacation.
Decorations had to be ordered by section so budgets could
be kept within each section.

And, there are no charges. Despite the good relsults the
Executive Committee expected from this policy, it is
somewhat of a mixed blessing for those involved in the
practical aspects of decorating for a $69,000 party.

Here’s the problem: checks are written twice a week, on
Tuesdays and Fridays. This leaves little leeway when having
to run to Wal-Mart for last-minute items that couldn’t be
ordered. Or, try explaining to a supplier that you need it to
be sent today but could they please wait a couple of days
for the check to be written.

This also presents the logistical problem of knowing how
much you need the check to be written for before leaving
for the store. This entails going to the stores, pricing each
item, and then going back to the store when the check is
written.

Neither system is perfect. The former encourages liberal
spending; the latter results in frustrated decorations chairmen.

One alternative that could be considered is a purchase
order system, which would require students to submit
purchase requests in advance, including rough estimates of
the items’ costs. This would allow for proper accounting on
the part of the SAB, as well as ﬂexibility in buying on the
part of the decorations chairmen. Also, place one person in
charge of the ﬁnances, someone who knows each chairman’s
budget well enough to issue purchase orders within each
budget. That’s the way to stay within the budget.

Next year’s FD auditing is apt to be better still than this
year’s. Each year we learn from our mistakes; hopefully this
year will be no different.

‘My View’ policy

As the editors of a student newspaper, we feel an
obligation to publish every student-opinion piece we receive,
and we encourage students and others in the W&L
community to submit letters or “My Views.” Submissions
should be made on an IBM-compatible disk, if possible, and
must be in our office, Room 208 of the University Center,
by noon on Tuesday to appear in that week’s edition.

In addition to the work of W&L students, when space
permits, we occasionally publish as “My Views” columns
from syndicates or other newspapers in an effort to present a
variety of viewpoints on the issues of the day. However, the
appearance of a “My View,” regardless of its source, does
not indicate an endorsement of its views by the editors.

The Phi is indeed our newspaper, but it is no more ours
than it is yours. The quality and diversity of its opinion page
are dependent on your submissions.

MY VIEW
By Alan Heinrich

The recent election of Violeta Chamorro’s UNO
coalition in Nicaragua — ﬁnanced to the tune of
$20 million by the U.S. government — is the latest
chapter in the U.S. govemment’s immoral inter-
ference in that country. From the early days of
“gunboat diplomacy” and marine invasions to its
institutionalization of the treacherous Nicaraguan
national guard and the empowerment of Anastasio
Somoza Sr. to its active support and morally-
oblivious ﬁnancing of the dictator’s murderous
regime, the United States has proven itself to have
nothing remotely resembling a morally sound basis
for its latest endeavors in Nicaragua.

Despite the enormous suffering of the Nic-
araguan people, despite the unabashed corruption of
Anastasio Sr.’s heir, Anastasio Jr., who once
boasted “Nicaragua is my farm,” despite the
brutality of the Nicaraguan national guard, which
routinely tortured men, women, children and the
elderly, and treated the American TV audience to

ii 'n\\‘\,‘ I
~" it < \\l.l<»\ ’ 
"-‘"29 I'll; \‘ \  i /"

the murder of ABC newsman Bill Stewart on live
television, the U.S. government clung insistently to
the Somoza regime.

Even in the final moments of the murderer’s
rule, the Carter administration pressured the Inter-
national Monetary Fund for a $66 million loan for
the tyrant. Faced with a population largely illiterate
and greatly malnourished, suffering from a devas-
tating earthquake and cut off from the swift and
effective channels of U.S. aid that characterized
Somoza‘s U.S. relations, the Sandinistas defaulted
on the $1.5 billion debt Somoza left behind. This
precipitated Washington’s anti-Sandinista obsession,
fueled with the rhetoric of anti-communism —
despite the fact that according to U.S. government
sources‘ themselves, the FSLN received more
support from Mexico, Venezuela and Costa Rica
than from Cuba.

Reagan wasted no time in initiating his eco-
nomic war as well as his Contra war, enlisting
many ex-Somoza officers under the leadership of
the Somocista Enrique Bermudez. Not surprisingly,
economic collapse resulted. This collapse — the
result of U.S. policy, not Sandinista mismanage-
ment — was responsible for the election of Charn—

orro’s coalition.

It is painfully ironic that the leaders of the
United States, a nation with its very origin in
revolution, should be ignorant of the nature of
revolutions today. Cuba did not “export” revolu-
tion to Nicaragua, nor have the Sandinistas ex-
ported revolution to El Salvador — revolutions have
indigenous causes, such as poverty, injustice and
political oppression. To speak of Central American
revolutions as needing an exporter, given the social
realities of the region, is nothing short of an insult
to the human spirit and a betrayal of the United
States’ own philosophical foundation.

In Central America, with its vast social inequal-
ity, revolution is logically synonymous with democ-
racy: democracy is only truly possible in a country
with a relatively equal distribution of power and
wealth.

Let's hope that the Charnorro government
proves to be different than the other U.S.- backed
governments of Central America, past and present,
which have been fundamentally counter-revolution-
ary, and recognizes that a democratic government
must be for, of, and by the people, and not the
protectorate for the privileges of the elite.

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

On an important day in Washing-
ton and Lee history, sometime in the
distant past, General Lee was so
bored that he called his faithful horse,
Traveller, and other campus authori-
ties together to discuss great works of
American literature. The meeting
went smoothly until Traveller became
so disgusted with Stonewall Jackson’s
analysis of The Scarlet Letter that he
spit his oats onto the carpet and
threatened to leave the university and
get a job pulling buggies around
Lexington with the tourist bureau. To
prevent this argument from becoming
physically violent, Lee tactfully
changed the subject.

Lee: Whoa, Traveller, why don’t
you relax. It’s only a book. And you,
Stonewall, shut up already about the
Scarlet “A.” Listen, we need to
invent some grandiose campus that
even the students can enjoy. Do
either of you Civil War has-beens
have any suggestions?

Traveller: I’ve got an idea. Why
don’t we pay tribute to the sun on
the first day of spring. We can all
drink the nectar of Bacchus, god of
California wine, and dance around

Sociology student defends fraternity survey

I wish to take this opportunity to apologize
for any misunderstanding that might have come
out of my Sociology 280 study on the Greek
system. Unfortunately, many people have
approached me in defense of the fraternity system
as if the purpose of my survey was to discredit
the fraternities of Washington and Lee.

For one, this survey was not specifically
aimed at fraternities at W&L. Also, I find it
interesting that only men who are involved in the
Greek system have found it necessary to
complain. Even though the survey is aimed to
extract information about sororities as well, the
women do not find it a personal attack.

‘ I in no way wish to attack the fraternities or

naked in the woods.

Lee: Good idea but it’s a bit too
pagan. Don't forget I’m a Christian.
Tliey’ll never name a chapel after me
if I sanction paganism!

Stonewall: I’ve got a better idea.
Why don’t we have a big formal
dance in the gym with two live
bands. The students can dress up in
fashionable uncomfortable clothing,
eat dinner at expensive restaurants
and get stinking drunk. We’ll even
encourage the female participants to
spend long hours in between songs
and conversations in the bathrooms
doing God knows what.

Lee: I like the idea, but it sounds
too much like a high school Prorri.

Stonewall: Yeah, but what if we
have some dance thene like the
Trojan War, for example, and spend
thousands of dollars making the gym
look like a Trojan battlefield.
Traveller can even pull a chariot and
you can pretned that you're Achilles.
Also, we could invite the faculty and
administration and encourage them to
get as drunk as the students. We
could even have a special student
dance comrriittee.

Lee: That sounds great, but
what's the dance committee for?
Stonewall: To make sure that the
dance theme remains secret until the
week before the dance.

Lee: Okay, but what are we
gonna call this thing? Fancy Slacks?

Stonewall: How about Fancy
Dress?

Traveller: Yeah, that's perfect.

And so Fancy Dress was born.
Although Traveller trampled
Stonewall Jackson, who was dressed
up like Hector, the Trojan warrior, at
the first Fancy Dress Ball, the FD
tradition continues sucessfully into the
present. This year’s theme is
Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, and
my sources inform me that at this
very moment, as I write, the FD
studnet staff is busy decorating the
gym with objects relevant to the
novel like Gatsby’s dead body and
the green light.

For those of you who have never
read Great Gatsby cliffnotes or seen
the movie, here’s a higlily-technical
summary. Jay Gatsby, who calls
everyone “Old Sport” and grew up
dirt poor, is a wealthy bootlegger
living in New York (i.e. the
wasteland). Gatsby has purchased a
gigantic mansion and an excessive
amount of shirts in order to attract
Daisy (or is it Rhododendron), the
love of his life, who turns out to be
about as interesting as petrified wood.
Daisy’s liberal sexual attitude is
appropriately symbolized by a green
light at the end of Gatsby’s dock

sororities. The behavior patterns described in the
survey come from scholarly studies on fraternities
and sororities in the past. These were not
accusations aimed at W&L. It is also not to
suggest that this is evident in every fraternity and
sorority in the nation. The study merely attempts
to study gender roles that emerge from the
possible inﬂuence of these institutions.

Perhaps the study will indicate that the ideas,
and even biases, toward these institutions are
unfounded. I welcome any indication that this is
true. In order to prove this one way or the other,
however, the survey is necessary.

This study is in no way a liberal crusade to
wipe out sororities and fraternities on this

campus. It is also in no way sponsored by the
administration. I am simply writing a paper for
a sociology class. I realize that fraternities have
been under great scrutiny lately, which explains
in part the defensive attitude. This attitude is
understandable. I only hope that a system that is
working so hard to maintain a respectable image
on campus will have enough confidence in itself
to answer this survey honestly so that the
attitudes on this campus can be conveyed.

(had she been virtuous the light
would have been red). At the end of
the novel, Gatsby is murdered in his
swimming pool by a minor character.
The point of the novel is obvious: if
you live in the wasteland and have a
swimming pool, watch out for minor
characters who might try to murder
you.
My confidential sources have
informed me that next year’s FD
theme will be The Industrial
Revolution and that the gym will be
appropriately decorated with sulfur-
dioxide emissions and noisy factory
machines (at least we have something
to look forward to). Self-proclaimed
FD-theme specialist, Alan Herrick,
predicts that the 1992 theme will be
The Cold War (one can only guess
how the gym will be decorated for
this one).

Before I end this column, I’d just
like -to rerriind underage readers that
the consumption of alcoholic
beverages by anyone under 21 years
of age is illegal in the state of
Virginia (my probation officer said
he’d lcnock a month off of my
sentence for mentioning this fact). Of
course, Gatsby lived during
prohibition and served grain punch,
champagne and Old Milwaukee Beer
at his parties, so I wouldn’t be overly
concerned with this rule.

to classic rock _
New format coming in April to |'p'SynC

By Bob Tompkins
Staff Reporter

1

WVLI (96.7 FM) in Lexington
will be changing its music format to
:I4assic rock and expanding its listen-
ing area, according to station manager
Klan Putbrese.

i According to Putbrese, the station
has obtained permission from the
Ftderal Communications Commission
W, increase its signal from three kilo-
watts to 25 kilowatts. With that
cliange WVLI will be able to reach
listeners as far away as Staunton and
Waynesboro to the north, and Bu-
clianan to the south.

4 The station currently serves the
Rockbridge County area with an adult
contemporary format, said Putbrese.

, Putbrese said there were two
rdasons for the change in format.
First, there is no classic rock station
in the Staunton area. “We wanted to
fill the void,” said Putbrese, “there
is. no classic (rock) station now.”
Second, Putbrese said he wants to
atiract a greater listening audience
from the local colleges. Mary Bald-
win College in Staunton, Sweet Briar
Cbllege in Amherst, and Randolph
Macon Woman’s College in Lynch-
burg, will be able to receive the more
powerful signal. Washington and
Lge, VMI and Southern Sem are
within the current coverage area.

S Putbrese expects the change in
format to take place around April 15.

’ WVLI will not begin transmitting
with a more powerful signal until a

site for a new tower is approved, said
Putbrese. Putbrese said the approval
process takes about six months, but
they wanted to change to classic rock
before then so they can work out the
new format.

Putbrese said that responses to the
change have been “very positive in
Staunton and Waynesboro and among
regional advertisers, especially beer
companies." Putbrese said that clas-
sic rock generally carries a listening
audience between the ages of 18 and
49, and those listeners are primarily
male.

WVLI is considering a site on the
Blue Ridge for its new transmitting
tower, said Putbrese. The tower will
be about 250 feet tall.‘ .,Right now
the station’s transmitter is near a
garbage dump north of Buena Vista,
said Putbrese. '

There are several criteria that must
be met before the new tower will be
approved, said Putbrese. The Federal
Aviation Administration must approve
the tower to make sure it will not
interfere with air traffic in the area,
and the FCC must be sure that the
transmissions will not interfere with
the quiet zone that surrounds the
Green Bank observatory in West
Virginia, Putbrese said.

The tower also must receive zon-
ing approval, said Putbrese, and have
certification that radiation levels from
the tower will be safe for animals
and people.

At three kilowatts, WVLI was
certified as a class A station bv the
FAA.

and" natural continuation of the
thought process that was in place
when the SAC was established in the
mid-seventies. ’ ’

Time, Inc. CEO stresses role of ads

 

By Blair Simmons
Staff Reporter

Calling advertising one of the
most sought after assets America can
offer the Eastern Bloc, Time, Inc.
Chief Executive Officer Reginald
Brack, '59, said advertising is the key
to a free economy and a free press.

Advertising increases sales vol-
ume, making mass production practi-
cal and bringing down prices, Brack
said. Falling prices stimulate compe-
tition for better, cheaper products,
he said.

As advertisements increase their
promises of quality improvement,
they also implement a program of
quality control far beyond what the
government could possibly achieve,
Brack said.

“Advertising is not a science, not
a fine art, not show business,” he
said. “It is a specialized, commer-
cial form of discourse."

By pouring money into the media,
advertising liberates the press from
dependence on federal funds, freeing
it from government regulation, Brack
said.

If advertising spending were re-

duced by oriiy five percent, about 140
television stations, 175 newspapers
and 1,500 magazines would fold, he
said.

“Advertising is the most efficient
way yet found for a seller to tell a
buyer about a product," Brack said.
“One. ad in Time magazine reaches
30 million people in 200 countries
around the world.”

Brack said that he wanted to
dispel some of the myths about ad-
vertising.

He said there is an important
distinction between “bad” advertise-
merits and “deceitful” ones, calling

the latter almost extinct in the nation-
al media.

Saying that bad advertisements are
part of the system, Brack said the
fear of litigation and the need to be
competitive usually prevent adver-
tisers from being intentionally decep-
tive. .

Brack said he is leaving the
United States next week to do market
research in the Eastern Block.
Spreading information and knowledge
is the first priority over there, said
Brack, and the American media is
trying to help them privatize their
press.

Why applaud Capt. Linda Bray?

MY VIEW

By J. Cameron Humphries

Since the Panamanian invasion and Noriega’s
capture, discussion of Operation Just Cause has not
centered on Noriega; in fact, he has not been
mentioned much at all. Instead, the press chose to
create a feminist heroine, Capt. Linda Bray, and in
doing so, re-opened debate on whether women
should be allowed to defend our nation in military
conflict. Ironically, we in Lexington find ourselves
at the center of this conﬂict, not because of our
proximity to Panama, but because the feminists
have chosen Virginia Military Institute as an
appropriate follow-up to their successful conquest
of a dog kennel.

Last week, The Ring-tum Phi chose to reprint
an editorial that appeared in another collegiate
newspaper. This is an unusual occurrence for our
school newspaper. Either The Ring—lum Phi staff
was too busy publishing the Fancy Dress supple-
ment to write their own editorial, or someone
believed that the editorial offered a unique and
compelling argument for allowing women to fight
in combat. Due to the quality of the last week's
issue and the article’s weakness, the decision to
reprint it must have been primarily due to time
restraints on the editorial board; it could not have
been for any other reason, because the article

offered nothing but an exercise in fallacious rea-

soning and feminist rhetoric.

In her column, Mary Jo Dumiington stated that
women should be admitted to the front lines in the
interest of “gender equality." The article admitted
that Capt. Bray’s contributions to the conflict were,
at best, clouded. More recent reports describe an
Army cover-up of women refusing to obey orders,
of their emotional breakdowns, and even of Capt.

 

In wars past, men were not
sent to the front lines for
any other reason than than
they were men. We do not
honor their physical
strength.

Bray’s most glorious victory — arriving at a
deserted dog kennel. The article in last week's Phi
concluded that Capt. Bray’s accomplishments were
not due to any military achievement, but because
the press referred to her as a soldier, and not a
woman. In past wars, have soldiers who captured
positions vacated by the enemy, failed to obey
orders, or undergone emotional breakdowns during
conﬂict received such attention? Of course not. The
only reason that Capt. Bray received any attention
whatsoever was because she is a woman.

Those who cite the events in Panama as a step
toward “gender equality" within the military are
only fooling themselves. There is no question that
male soldiers have failed to obey orders, suffered
emotional breakdowns in the heat of conﬂict, and
even captured abandoned enemy territory. It proba-
bly even occurred in Panama. But the American
public does not hear about it, and those soldiers do
not have their picture on the cover of People or,
any other magazine. The issue of women in the
military has not opened up any question of “gen-i
der equality,” but that of gender inequality.

But, since when has gender equality had any-
thing to do with war? Men have never been sent
to the front lines merely on the basis of physical
ability. They were sent because they were men.
There are a great many strong and able—bodied men
in our Army. Were the United States to reinstitute

the draft, it is a fair assumption that there would
be a great many weak and ill-suited men within
the military ranks as well. In wars past, those men
sent to the front lines were not sent because they
could do a certain number of push—ups, run a given
number of miles, or for any other reason except
that they were men. We do not honor their physi-
cal strength. They fought for their country; they
fought for the right to raise their families in a free
nation; they fought for the rights of their mothers,
sisters, daughters, and wives to enjoy equality.
They did not fight for women to become men.

At no other point in Western civilization has a
nation considered military service either a right of
its people, or a privilege. It is, and will remain, a
duty. Those calling for women’s placement on the
front lines in no way promote gender equality.
Aside from the obvious distinctions that are already
present in our military for women, they also
establish a potentially moral precedent: If we are
to place only those women on the front lines who
are physically capable of doing so, why shouldn't
we do the same for men? Furthermore, if we allow
only those women to fight who so desire, why
should we not obligate only those men who also
desire to fight?

If our nation is to defend itself in time of peril,
then Mary Jo Dunnington’s argument would not
establish anything but a far greater gender inequali-
ty than now presently exists.

If we as a nation are to follow Mary Jo Dun-
nington’s suggestion that military service be dele-
gated only to those who wish to fight and those
who are capable of doing so, not only is our
military in grave danger, but the nation it is
intended to protect and the freedoms it upholds.

The Ring-tum Phi, March 8, 1990

SBA releases car-tax analysis EC

By James Lake
Associate Editor

Student Bar Association President
John Falk has released an “issue
brief” that discusses the thinking
behind Lexington’s move to collect a
personal property tax on student cars.

The key issue concerning the tax,
the brief says, is whether student cars
are normally “garaged” or “parket ”
in Lexington.

“All students should first evalu-
ate whether or not they maintain an
automobile in the City of Lexington
for more than six months in any
calendar year,” the brief advises.

Those who don’t probably do not
have to worry about the tax, accord-
ing to the brief. Those who do need
to find out whether the owner of the
car is currently paying a personal

property tax on it.

The brief next divides students
according to whether they are “in-
statc” or “out—of-state."

“The law is clear,” Falk said. If
the city can establish that a vehicle is
primarily kept in Lexington, the
owner will probably be subject to the
tax, although he may be able to
obtain a refund later, he said.

Students from Virginia may pay
the tax, provide proof of having paid
elsewhere and request a complete
refund. Virginians who do not volun-
tarily pay the tax but receive a bill
from the city should check to see if
their cars were assessed properly, the
brief advises.

Lexington City Manager Joseph
King has said the city may try to re-
fund only the difference between the
two taxcs, but the SBA brief says
case law does not appear to support

that idea. In fact, a 1976 case, Ar-
lington County v. Stull, “supports the
opposite conclusion, that personal
property such as an automobile will
be taxed in only one Virginia locali-
ty,” the brief says.

For students not from Virginia,
the law provides a “non-resident
exemption” that means students who
can show they pay property tax else-
where do not have to pay it in Lex-
ington. Those students may want to
simply tell the city that they are not
required to pay, the brief advises.

But out-of-state students whose
cars are not taxed as personal proper-
ty “will in all likelihood be required
to submit to the tax,” according to
the brief.

Falk added that students who
register to vote in Lexington and own
a car are very likely to have to pay
the tax.

, From W&L Sports Information

Jeff Stickley, the man who’s seen
, Washington and Lee baseball fortunes

improve with every season he’s been
‘at the helm, is reduced to stand—up
comedy to deal with his 1990 team.

‘With his team decimated by gradua-

4tion and filled with inexperience,
what else can you do but laugh?
“We have such a young team,”
,the fourth-year head coach says,
“that when we go on road trips, l’ll
“have to stop and get them baby food
,and apple juice.”
Indeed, the 1990 edition of the
lWashington and Lee baseball team
will be very young and inexperi-
enced. Only eight of the twenty-five
‘players on the pre-season roster are
4 juniors or seniors, and only a few of
those are provenperforrners. But the
pyouth of the team hasn’t discouraged
Stickley.
‘ .' The Generals, who finished tied
.for third in the Old Dominion Athlet-
ic Conference last season, are picked
‘to‘finish next-to-last this season, no
,doubt because of graduation.
Last season, the Generals finished
‘ll-9, 6-6 and made Smith Field a

veritable death-trap for opponents,
winning seven and dropping only two
at home. W&L reached the semi-
finals of the ODAC tournament be-
fore falling to eventual champion
Hampden—Sydney.

Stickley makes it clear that his
1990 edition has a lot of work to do.

“We are not a very good team
right now," he said. “But we have
the potential to be as good as we
were last year.”

Last season's team, which hit .310
as a team and scored 10 runs in a
game four times, graduated nine
players, none of whom will be easy
to replace.

Outfielder Tom Skeen and catcher
Eddie Klank, the leading power hit-
ters will be sorely missed, as will
shortstop Harry Halpert, first base-
man Max Petzold and third baseman
Tony Waskiewicz. The five players
started all 20 games a year ago.
Skeen and Klank, who combined for
six home runs and 37 runs batted in,
were second-tearn All-ODAC selec-
lions.

Also gone are pitchers Mike Tem-
ple, David Holland and Chris Cun-
ningham. Designated hitter/pitcher

 

The Ring-tum Phi, March 8, 1990

Richard Grace is also gone. Grace
and Temple each registered two wins
and Grace hit .372 as the designated
hitter.

Leading the offensive returnees
will be senior second baseman and
co—captain Bobby Rimmer. Rimmer,
a second team All-ODAC player,
started every game last season while
hitting .351. Joining him will be
junior outfielder Tim Wheeler, who
hit .323, including a three-run homer
in W&L’s 18-8 win at home over
Eastern Mennonite in the ODAC
tournament.

Also returning are sophomore T.J.
Daly and senior David Smith. Both
will see time at first base and on the
mound. Daly hit .467 last season and
had a record of 1-3 as a pitcher.
Smith was second on the team with
three home runs last season.

Anchoring the pitching staff for
the Generals will be last year’s
Freshman Athlete-of-the-Year Steve
Momorella. The sophomore had a
record of 6-0 in seven starts with
three complete games and one shut-
out. Momorella got the win over
Eastern Mennonite in the ODAC
toumey.

Sophomore outfielders Brian Harp-

Youth to be served on Smith Field

er and Pete Klingelhofer will also add
valuable experience to this year’s
team. The pair combined to start 25
games last season while driving in 15
runs. Junior Chris Kavanagh will look
to take over the catching chores from
Klank.

Stickley will look to sophomores
Jason Hendricks and Toby McCoy
along with freshman Justin Denny to
contribute on the mound this season.

The ODAC, which gets tougher
every year, may be even more trouble
this year. Perennial power Lynchburg
is as strong as ever and the league's
coaches like the Hornets to win it all.
Other strong squads include Hamp-
den-Sydney, Bridgewater and new
league acquisition Virginia Wesleyan.

Youth, inexperience, uncertainty
are the watchwords for W&L baseball
this spring. But Stickley plans to
throw a few curves at those who
picked his team to finish last.

“Things might be slow at the
beginning because of our inexperi-
ence, but we could be a fine team at
the end of the season. Our goal is to
do as well as we did last season, and
I think potentially we can be that
good. But we've got to get much
better than we are now.”

ing standard with his leap of 46-
11 at the VMI Winter Relays on
Feb. 10. Gilbert, the only Divi-
sion III athlete to place in the
meet, finished third in the event.

Gilbert is currently ranked

seventh in the nation in the triple

From Staff Reports

Washington and Lee freshman
Claire Dudley, the 1990 Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Swimmer of the Year, will seek
to become the third woman in
W&L history to earn NCAA

Jacksonville, Fla., is currently
ranked fifth in the nation in the

‘ 

200 breaststroke with a time of
2:31.45.

States Championships, Dudley
won the 100 and 200 breast-
strokes. She finished third in the
400 individual medley in the ASC
competition and won the 400
individual medley in the ODAC
meet.

Dudley, who will swim in the
nationals March 8-10, holds three
school records, including the 400
individual medley, the 100 breast-
stroke and the 200 breaststroke.

Dudley has won at least two

Mastrogiovanni sparks W&L
past Randolph-Macon 9-3
as Stagnitta earns first win

By Jay Plotkln

It lasted just a bit longer than
Mike Tyson's title defense against
Michael Spinks, which lasted all of
91 seconds.

Wednesday, the Washington and
Lee lacrosse team ran off the first
eight goals to defeat Old Dominion
Athletic Conference rival Randolph-
Macon 9-3 in Ashland, Va.

Senior attaekman Chris Mastro-
giovanni opened the scoring just 91
seconds into the game off a feed
from junior midﬁelder Clark Wight,
and the Generals never looked back.

Just over 30 seconds later, sopho-
more Wiemi Douoguih found junior
Mike Moseman on the man advan-
tage. Mastrogiovarmi a second goal,
from sophomore Jeff Roberts with
6:31 to play in the first quarter, and
junior Todd Garliss scored off a

in the opening quarter.

The Generals, the pre-season

rolling with a 6-3, 6-2 defeat of J. P.

5-0 game at the half.

Wight scored twice to open the
second half, one off a feed from
Moseman, and Mastrogiovanni scored
his fourth goal of the afternoon with
7:05 to play in the third quarter to
give the Generals an 8-0 lead.

H-SC 7-2

Manley and sophomore Jack Tinney
dropped straight set matches.

However, sophomore Kelly Van-
dever defeated Will Stanfield 6-3, 4-
6, 6-3 at No. 5 to give the Generals
a little breathing room heading into

The Lexington Voting Regulations
Board is bringing voter registration to
Washington and Lee.

City Registrar Lucille Joyce will
be here Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 1
p.m. She’ll be at the ODK Circle
outside the Co-op if the warm weath-
er keeps up, but if temperatures drop
she'll move into the Co-op or the
University Center.

The voting board asked Joyce to
come to W&L after receiving com-

plaints from students that they were
harassed when they tried to register
to vote. According to the board's
president, Bill Stearns, the registrar
was not intentionally harassing stu-
dents. Instead, he said, she was ask-
ing the students questions to deter-
mine whether they were actually
residents of Virginia, which is re-
quired to register.

Despite what he called Joyce’s
good intentions, Steams said singling
out any group of registrants for ques-
tioning was clearly illegal.

He said Joyce no longer ques-
tions the residency status of students,

and she’s coming to W&L to make
up for any problems students may
have had in the past.

Students may be especially inter-
ested in getting a voice in city gov-
ernment because of the number of
issues before the city council which
are directly related to student life.

Speciﬁcally, city council will be
considering the approval of the W&L
Master Plan and conditional use per-
mits.

However, Stearns encourages
students to think carefully before
registering to vote here. Gaining a

FD tradition in the black

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

The Fancy Dress Ball, traditional-
ly a black-tie affair, started a new
tradition this year — the event was
run in the black.

“Conservatively speaking, we
were about $6,000 to $8,000 under
budget,” said John Hamilton, Fancy
Dress auditor. “We could end up as
much as $10,000 under budget.”

Hamilton said that not all book-
keeping is finished yet, but he will
know how far under budget the event
was by Monday’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting, when the Fancy Dress
Committee presents its ﬁnancial re-
port.

A new system of budgeting
helped keep the Fancy Dress budget
more organized this year, said Kath-
leen Duwel, Student Activities Board
Treasurer. The Fancy Dress budget
was kept separate from the rest of the
SAB budget, making it considerably
easier to determine the bills and
revenue, she said. Last year, the

Fancy Dress budget was lumped in
with the budget for other SAB ac-
tivities.

Another vital change in the finan-
cial organization of Fancy Dress was
that there were no charge accounts
this year, Duwel said. All incidental
expenses were paid for out of a petty
cash fund, she said. Last year the
SAB could not keep track of "11 the
charges that were amassed, and it
was getting Fancy Dress bills into the
summer. The late bills greatly con-
tributed to the $22,000 deﬁcit the
SAB had last year, she said.

Also, the ball was very wisely
budgeted this year, according to Du-
wel. “We budgeted according to the
minimum income we thought we
would get from the ball,” she said.
“In the past, the committee made the
budget according to income they
thought they might get from the
ball — it was more of a stab in the
dark.”

Associate Dean of Students Leroy
“Buddy” Atkins was invaluable in
advising the committee on how to set
the budget because of his past ex-

perience with Fancy Dress, Duwell
said.

The sale of Fancy Dress memor-
abilia was» an example of the smart
budgeting, according to Duwel. “In
the budget, we counted on selling
half of the memorabilia, but we did
much better than that,” she said.

Hamilton said the ball “probably”
lost money last year. The new restric-
tions on spending helped make the
Fancy Dress Committee members
more cognizant of the need to spend
wisely, he added.

The Fancy Dress Committee spent
about $57,000, according to commit-
tee chairman Alexander Hitz. The
money paid for expenses such as
decorations, bands and printing.Hitz
said about 1,300 tickets were sold
but over 3,000 people attended the
ball. More people attended the ball
than tickets were sold because some
people get in free, he said, such as
professors and Fancy Dress workers.

The ball ran smoothly, according
to Hitz. “We had no problems," he
said/‘There were no complaints from
anybody about anything."

does have some losses, he said.

Students deﬁnitely lose a voice in
their hometown govemments, almost
definitely lose coverage under their
parents’ homeowners insurance and
possibly lose residency status in their
home state, according to Stearns.

In addition, claiming Lexington to
be your legal residency comes at a
price, local taxes.

Still, Steams said, students do
have the option of voting here for
four years and re-registering at home
after gradution. Furthermore, he said,
students can buy their own homeown-
ers’ insurance, which will vary in

Dumas elected senior rep.

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

Willard Dumas, Thomas Spurgeon,
Leslie Lewis and Stephen White
brought in majorities in Monday’s
election to claim the positions of
senior Executive Committee repre-
sentative, senior class president and
senior class vice president, respective-
ly.

Dumas captured 169 of the 582
votes cast for senior EC representa-
tive; 291 seniors voted. John Fial—
cowitz faced Andrew Gaffney in
today’s run-off for the other EC seat.
Matthew Malloy was eliminated from
the race Monday. Dumas did not
wish to comment on his win.

Spurgeon captured the senior class
presidency with a comfortable mar-
gin of victory over opponent Bryan
Patterson.

Two of the senior class vice pres-
idencies will be occupied by Lewis
and White next year. John Neslage
and Cristina Robinson contended for
the third in run-off, while David
Blank and Jonathan Myer stood de-
feated.

White attributed his victory to
“the job I’ve done for the last three
years” as a class officer. He added
that he looks forward to “a couple
really good senior parties and get-
[ting] together with the junior class,”
as well as continued smooth opera-

Students concerned about their
residency status because they would
like to pay resident tuition for gradu-
ate school in their home states should
check with that state. Voter registra-
tion is only one of a number of
qualiﬁcations most schools consider
before determining residency.

In rising junior elections, William
Jones, Clayton Kennington, Spencer
Patton and Caroline Wight all moved
to the run-off for their class’ two EC
seats, leaving Ward Maedgen and Jon
Omdorff behind.

The race for junior class presi-
dent narrowed to Read Folline against
Willie Henderson in the run-off.
The junior class vice-presidential
election yielded the only write-in
candidates. Jennifer Fischer, who
appeared on the ballot, lost to Wil-
liam Toles, also on the ballot. Toles,
however, today faced write-in candi-
date Christopher Haley who received
66 of the 271 votes cast for the post.

The freshman class yielded the
highest voter turnout with 354 voters.
The 708 votes cast in the 12-candi-
date election for sophomore EC rep-
resentatives selected Sean Gatewood,
Joshua MacFarland, Kirk Ogden and
Robert Wilson to face one another in
run-off.

Richard Burke and Donald Ridge

By James Lake
Associate Editor

Washington and Lee President
John Wilson has written the City of
Lexington to say he is still consid-
ering how W&L will respond to the
city’s request for a list of student
cars.

Wilson last month received a
letter from City Manager Joseph
King, asking for a list of students’
names, addresses and automobiles.

King wants the list so the city
can more easily collect Lexington’s
personal property tax, which he says
students who live in the city and
own cars should be required to pay.

Wilson said he told King the

OPINION

;PHC gets balled
égfrom SAC vote

Almost since its creation, the Panhellenic Council has
Zbeen trying to achieve full representation on the Student
fAffairs Committee so that it may have representation
{equal to that of other student groups. Last week, that
:effort failed.

__ SAC is now composed of five faculty members and
administrators and five students. The students -- the
}presidents of the Interfratemity Council, the Executive
Committee, the Student Bar Association and the Student
Conduct Committee and the head dorm counselor —
{together serve as representatives of the student body.

To us, it seems only logical that PHC also should have
voting representation on SAC, since that committee is
currently voting on issues that directly affect the women’s
fraternities. Right now, the PHC has voice on all issues
and a vote — waived to PHC from IFC - only on those
issues affecting the sororities. Needless to say, this is a
cumbersome compromise.

To give the sororities equal representation, SAC moved
to give PHC representation equal to that of all other SAC
members, and to add a sixth faculty member in order to
maintain an even ratio of faculty to students.

Nevertheless, the faculty, in one afternoon, voted down
the SAC’s proposal for this minimal restructuring, even
though SAC, a committee with an administration-
appointed or faculty-elected majority, debated relevant
issues for almost six weeks before making its proposal.
The faculty apparently feared too much Greek inﬂuence
on SAC and were in general unwilling to enlarge the
committee.

But an increase from 10 to 12 is not excessive. Yes,
another faculty member would have to join the committee,
but is that really too much to ask? SAC exists so the
university and students can meet to monitor and take part
in the “co-curricular” activities of the school. W&L has
always accented the importance of developing well-
rounded individuals, and it seems odd that the faculty
would balk at continuing to support that idea.

It is true that committees such as SAC can be draining
diversions from academia for professors. But we hope that

it is not any reluctance to work with students that is
keeping the faculty from wanting to enlarge SAC. We
would like to believe that there isn’t a “not me!” attitude
among those to whom we turn for support and advice on
so many matters.

The negative votes for the proposal seem also to be
stemming from a general anti-Greek sentiment. However,
the faculty approved the colonization of the three
sororities, and it seems out of place for the faculty to
attempt to damn them now by not allowing them full
representation. Further, the social system at W&L is,
rightly or wrongly, based largely on the Greek system. It
is backwards for the faculty to attempt to attack this
reality by not allowing PHC to vote.

In actuality, however, the “Greek vote” would increase
to only about 16 percent of the entire committee’s vote.
This percentage could in no way prove to be a major
factor in swaying SAC voting — especially since the
faculty will still control selection of a SAC majority.

Also, it seems that the faculty are wrongly assuming
that the PHC and IFC are of similar stock and would vote
together on all issues, simply because they are both
“Greek.” But the two groups are vitally different in their
structures, orientations and duties, and the issues affecting
each group are incomparable. Fraternities have weekend
parties and house rules and noise violations to contend
with, while sororities need to approve occasional hotel
rentals for parties and are working to find housing.

In any case, the PHC accounts for 60 percent of the
undergraduate female population — not a negligible
amount of women with essentially the same interests.
Similar-sized interest groups are represented on SAC
without question by the head dorm counselor and
president of the Student Bar Association, so it would seem
that mere size is not the problem.

To be fair, this question of representation is extremely
complex. But that is the problem. The faculty voted it
down quickly. This issue requires a closer look and
reconsideration by the faculty. All involved should
reconsider their initial reactions and listen to the facts.

MY VIEW
By Jennifer Spreng

Sometimes when we stop and think about how
the majority of people in‘ this world live, in deca-
dent and cruel poverty, reason escapes, and out-
raged passion takes its place. When we realize to
our horror that our country has supported a dis-
gusting tyrant like Anastasio Somoza, reason eludes
us. Passion sets in, causing good people to jump
without thinking on the bandwagon of any leader
who claims to have answers.

There is much in the history of U.S. relations
with Nicaragua to indict. In his “My View”
column last week, Alan Heinrich rightly points that
out. But the Sandinista regime wasn't the answer
to Nicaragua’s problems just because the man it
overthrew, Anastasio Somoza, was a bad guy. Nic-
aragua’s revolution didn’t end in 1979 when
Somoza was overthrown; it was subverted by a
group just as heinous as those it replaced. U.S.
involvement helped the revolution in the 1970s,
and it helped complete it in the 1990s.

Painting Jimmy Carter as pro-Somoza is a gross
misrepresentation of the facts. Upon arrival in
office, Carter almost immediately stopped military
aid to Somoza. Even Henry Kissenger stated that
“the Jimmy Carter administration actively partici-
pated in the overthrow of the Somoza govem—
ment.”

Moreover, in the first two years of the San-
dinista regime, the administration gave $118
million in direct aid. This was much more than the
United States gave to Somoza. Carter also arranged
for $262 million in World Bank and Inter-Ameri-

can Development Bank loans for the regime.

The group that overthrew Somoza was a genu-
ine coalition of many ideologies. The ruling junta
included several moderates like Anturo Cruz and
Violete Chamorro. One by one democratic ideals
were betrayed. Many who became Contra leaders,
like Adolfo Calero, fought with Daniel Ortega’s
group against Somoza, but became disillusioned
with the totalitarian regime that resulted.

The Sandinistas originally promised open
elections as soon as possible after the overthrow of
Somoza. After taking power, they reneged on that
commitment until 1984. It is impossible to know
‘what the result of the elections might have been if
the main opposition candidates, Arturo Cruz and
Virgilio Godoy, had not declined to run due to
government threats, lack of media access, and
limited organizational time,

The aid from Nicaragua to insurgents in El
Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras and Ecuador is
also staggering in volume.

In 1985, Ecuador broke off diplomatic relations
with Nicaragua for “gross, inadrnissable attacks on
the dignity, sovereignty and independence" of that
country - involving terrorist attacks.

During the 1983 trial of terrorists in Costa
Rica, the defendants admitted receiving logistical
support and training from the Sandinista regime.

Since 1981, Nicaraguans have been recruiting

Nicaragua: a U.S. suces.

and training Hondurans as armed insurgents. The
Honduran government has even arrested Nicaraguan
advisors to these insurgents in Honduras.

In December 1980, El Salvadoran rebels receiv-
ing military material from the Nicaraguan govem-
ment complained that the volume of arms ship-
ments was so large that they could not assimilate
it all. A rebel leader said that in 1981 and 1982
virtually all of this unit's arms came from Nicara-
gua. Nicaraguan syrnpathizers often say that many
captured rebel weapons are of American manufac-
ture, but serial numbers show that these were
originally sent to Vietnam.

The list could go on and on.

The Sandinistas failed in many of their prom-
ises to their citizens. The government was proud of
its campaign against illiteracy, but free-lance writer
Dee Rivers Stirnpson reports that though tuition is
free, many poor children do not attend because
urtiforrns and books are not free.

In Masaya, a small city south of Managua,
Stirnpson saw a mother throwing rocks at the
Sandinista Youth office shouting “You carmot have
my boy!" A man wept in the middle of a frus-
trated uprising that “Everyone had betrayed us.
They carmot have any more of my sons! They

I write this arti:le in response to
Alan Heinrich’s article, “Election
Blues in Nicaragua” that appeared in
last week's Phi. Mr. Heirrrich’s article
had two main points: to lament the
recent Sandinista election loss in
Nicaragua, and to criticize U.S.
involvement in Nicaraguan affairs.

I feel compelled to provide some
facts about Nicaraguan life during
Sandinista rule, since Mr. Heinrich
failed to do so. In 1979, the
Sandinistas promised democracy, but
they delivered a decade of dogmatic
Marxism-Leninism. By 1989,
Nicaragua had become the poorest
nation in the Western Hemisphere.

ammunition shipments to communist
terrorists in El Salvador. The Soviet
Union and Cuba supplied Ortega’s
regime with over $2.5 billion per
year in military aid during the mid
1980s, and Nicaragua built up the
largest army in Central America.

The Sandinistas engineered this
economic collapse while Ortega
censored the press, and Party
members enjoyed lives of luxury. Mr.
Heinrich somehow attributes the
Nicaraguan economic failure to “the
result of U.S. policy."

I remind Mr. Heinrich that Daniel
Ortega, not Ronald Reagan, decided
to nationalize private land, destroy
coffee plantations, and wreck a once-
thriving Nicaraguan economy.

for eight years to regain freedom. Mr.
Heinrich accuses the United States
of exporting revolution when he
terms this nationalist struggle “his
[President Reagan's] Contra war.”
However, I ﬁnd it ironic that Mr.
Heinrich later rejects the idea of
“exporting revolution" by
passionately defending the principle
of indigenous revolutions arising from
oppression and poverty. He accuses
the United States of something he
asserts does not exist, and he fails to
recognize the legitimate Contra
indigenous revolution.

Mr. Heinrich attempts to take the
moral high ground and accuse the
United States of knowing what is
right for Nicaragua. He asserts that

Nicaraguan people have rejected, isn't
Mr. Heinrich guilty of the same
paternalistic attitude he accuses U.S.
policymakers of?

Mr. Heinrich questions the
judgements of the Nicaraguans in the
recent free election. I can understand
his reservations because they have
had little experience in free elections;
the Sandinistas ruled for a decade
before submitting to one. However, I
have confidence in the Nicaraguan
people. Again I ﬁnd it ironic that
such a passionate defender of
Nicaraguan nationalism, which Mr.
Heinrich claims to be, laments the
will of the people. Why is Mr.
Heinrich “Blue” when Nicaraguans
are shouting with joy?

Where do the election posters go?

MY VIEW
By Rick J. Peltz

Somewhere there must be a place where all the
campaign posters that disappear from campus get
together and have a drink and a laugh at their
candidates’ expense.

The number of posters that disappeared in this
week's election and the previous week’s campaign-
ing unfortunately exceeds a number attributable to
rain and wind. I say unfortunately because that
leaves human interference as the only remaining
option.

Senior Executive Committee Rep. David Radul-
ovic said at Monday night’s EC meeting that
Buildings and Grounds was probably responsible
for the removal of most of the posters.

He has a point. In some instances, posters
disappear in indiscriminate fashion, whole sets re-
moved from a wall and such. This seems to
indicate that someone concerned with the beautifi-
cation of our campus is choosing to remove posters

from certain places wherever they may detract from.

the homey, non—comrnercial atmosphere.

However, B&G Superintendent James Arthur
said Monday that no posters were removed by
B&G personnel unless they were, essentially, on
something white, such as columns, or doors to
most buildings.

What I find more disturbing is that many
posters are removed in seeming discriminate
fashion. Case—in-point:

I myself placed five posters on brick walkways

for a friend and candidate late at night before .

Monday's elections. Some time between 3 a.m. and
12:30 p.m. Monday, one of those posters was
removed. Some time between 12:30 p.m. and 3
p.m., three more were removed.

All four of the missing posters were in clear
view of passersby; three were in plain view of
polling places where Voting Regulations Board
representatives should have been stationed; three
were definitely removed during prime pedestrian
traffic hours; and one was removed from the
company of other posters surrounding it.

Mr. Radulovic said that B&G is probably
responsible.

However, Mr. Arthur said that B&G removed

no posters from brick walkways. Moreover, it does
not follow that B&G would discriminate one poster
from a bunch.

Some person, therefore, outside of B&G, must
have deliberately and wrongfully removed at least
one of those posters I placed, likely more, and
likely witnessed.

This is not an isolated case. In speaking with
the EC Monday night, I learned that candidates’
posters are commonly discovered missing without
explanation, and often when others around them
have not been disturbed.

I call upon the student body, the EC, and the
Voting Regulations Board to recognize that the
removal of candidates’ posters, in such an illegiti-
mate fashion as I have described, is at the very
least poor conduct in violation of the spirit of trust
that supposedly pervades W&L life, and at the
very most may be argued as an honor violation.

We cannot compromise our community of trust
in any way. Every act that violates that trust and
every witness to such an act who doesn't report it
is one more stain on W&L's armor of honor. No
one should want such a stain to be their most
lasting contribution to W&L.

The Master Plan and the condi-
tional use permits are two separate
issues. The Master Plan calls for the
rezoning of land owned by W&L,
including Red Square and the David-
son Park area across the street from

_ the Police Station.

Approval of the plan will allow
renovations of fraternity houses to
continue as planned in the Fraternity
Renaissance program.

The conditional use permits are
exemptions to a city ordinance that
limits to four the number of students
that can live together in a single
house.

A number of W&L students live
in houses covered by these permits.
The permits are now being considered
for renewal, but their renewal is in
jeopardy.

In a recent public hearing, local
residents pointed out that the houses
could be rented to Lexington’s low

_income residents. Also, local residents

have complained about student distur-
bances of otherwise peaceful neigh-
borhoods.

If these permits aren’t renewed,
students expecting to live in these
homes will need to look for new
living arrangements next year.

The ultimate fate of the Master
Plan, the conditional use permits and
related issues that may come up in
the future lies in the hands of city
council.

Although both the plan and the
permits are now being considered by
the Planning Commission, all action
recommended by the commission
must first be approved by council.

 

TAX

from page 1

request raises several legal ques-
tions. Under federal law, according
to Wilson and the W&L Student
Handbook, schools usually are not
allowed to release information about
a student without his permission.
' Maj. Gen. John Knapp, superin-
tendent of Virginia Military
Institute, recieved a similar letter
from King, and Wilson said Knapp
has asked for, but has not yet re-
ceived, a legal opinion from Vir-
ginia Attorney General Mary Sue
Terry as to whether the schools le-
gally can turn over such a list.

Wilson also said he told King he
has other questions about the tax-
collecting effort.

The president said he is concem-
ed that turning over the information
the city wants would encourage stu-

dents to refuse to register their cars
with the university.

Also, Wilson said, he is afraid
that to comply with the city's re-
quest would encourage students to
live outside of the city and thus dis-
courage involvement in on-carnpus
activities.

Finally, Wilson said he told
King he does not think Lexington
“has taken fully into account the
fact that over 80 percent of our un-
dergraduate students come from oth-
er states” and that many of those
students pay a similar tax back
home. '

“It seems on the surface a most
unwise course to invest in a tax-col-
lecting effort with such a small
number of potentially elligible tax
payers at stake,” Wilson said.

e reported

in Rockbridge Co.

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

Rockbridge County has its first
confirmed rabies case in several
years, according to John R. Tucker, a
santarian at the Rockbridge County
Health Department.

A pony, pastured on the west side
of U.S. Route 11 between Tirnberlake
and Fairfield, was infected with ra-
bies, Tucker said.

“I don't know how it happened,”
he said. ‘‘It doesn't make sense. The
pony was confined in a ham for
several months.”

Tucker said the pony was most
likely infected by a bat, because bats
are the only animals that carry rabies
without being infected by the disease.

Also, since the only other reported
cases of rabies near Lexington have
been in Augusta County, it is unlike-
ly anotiaér kind of animal could have

4
ftriiva/ed far enough to infect the

pony, Tucker said

Rabies, which is fatal for ani-
mals, can be treat.-:‘. in humans with
a series of intermuscular shots, ac-
cording to Tucker. Rabies shots,
which have a reputation for being
extremely painful, are painful now for
a different reason, said Tucker.
“They aren’t so physically painful
anymore,” he said, “as they are

U: financially painful."

The cost of the ‘rabies vaccine,

J shots and physcians’ time totals about

$1,500 per person, according to Tuck-
er.

The disease is transmitted when
the saliva of a rabid animal passes
through the skin of a person or an-
other animal. ' '

It is improbable that someone
could get the disease from eating or
drinking something that came in
contact with an infected animal, Tu-
cker said.

Some symptoms rabid animals
have that students should watch out
for are aggressiveness and an inability
to swallow, Tucker said.

“Any change in the behavior of
your animal indicates something is
wrong, and you should get your
animal confined and take it to a
vetemarian,” Tucker said.

The Commonwealth of Virginia
requires all dogs more than six
months old to be vaccinated for ra-
bies, Tucker said. Dogs must get
their first shot at six months, an adult
shot at one year and a shot every
three years thereafter.

Every dog in Virginia must also
be licensed with the state, he added,
and it is impossible to get a license
without proof of vacination.

Cats must be vaccinated once a
year, he said.

Tucker said he hopes this is an
isolated cases of rabies. “I have no
reason to suspect that it is anything
other than isolated,” Tucker said.

SPRENG

from page 2

Mr. Heinrich describes our anti-
Sandinista policy as “counterrevolu-
tion," and therefore, wrong. If that is
accurate, _ we must agree that the
students in Tienarnrnen Square were
counterrevolutionary as well. Thus, if
we carry the logic further, we would
have to agree from his characteriza-
tion of counterrevolution that the stu-
dents in China were somehow wrong.
I'm not prepared to accept that argu-
ment. I question the entire premise.

To equate the American Revolu-
tion with the Sandinista government
is also intellectually irresponsible. I

dignify it with a response because I
do not want any naive readers to be
confused by the glamour of the argu-
ment. The American__ revolutionary,
leaders never lied about their goals,
were as democratic as possible, and
encouraged so much initial public
criticism that they had to completely
scrap their initial plan of government
and draft a new one, which they
subsequently sent to the people for
approval. The Constitution has been
copied all over the world and is
widely respected as a work of genius.

Our experience is the exception.

Revolution has a depressing habit of
going awry — as it did in France in
the 1700s, Russia in 1917, Spain in
the__1930s, and; as _r_no_s,t people now
realize it did in Nicaragua in 1979.
The Nicaraguan people ‘supported

the overthrow of Somoza, but they‘

never picked the government they got
as a result. Mrs. Chamorro may now
have the chance to bring the real
government of the people, by the
people and for the people to Nicara-
gua. If the United States participated
in the process in a positive way,
well, good for us!

A student expressed concern to the
EC at the comrnittee’s Monday night
meeting that many campaign posters
were wrongfully taken down prior to
and during elections.

Senior EC Rep. David Radulovic
proposed that Buildings and Grounds
may be removing the posters.

Buildings and Grounds Superin-
doors and columns would be re-
moved.

EC President Dumas said he
would address the concern to Goings.

Also at Monday night's meeting,

Dumas, on behalf ‘of the student
body, thanked all candidates for their
efforts.

EC Secretary Christopher Giblin
later added that “[VRB Chairman]
Wesley Goings deserves a lot of
credit for the fine job he's done.”
Giblin cited “three years of devoted
service to the VRB [and] W&L" on
Goings’ part.

In other EC business, Dumas re-
ported that two applications to the
White Book Revisions Committee
have been received from the under-
graduate campus and 10 from the

Law School. The EC extended the
deadline for applications to Monday,
March 19.

“We need people on that com-
mittee," said EC Vice President
Jonathan Sheinberg, urging more
students to apply.

the publication’s budget repon. Of
$2,979.90 in original allocation and
interest, $1,193.74 was spent on the

SPORTS

W&L rips Ithaca for third straight win

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

Winning, or losing for that matter,
is something that can grow on a
team. For the past two seasons, the
Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse
team had losing grow on them like a
bad rash.

But recently, however, it seems
that the Generals have found the
calamine lotion and have cured the
losing rash. In defeating Ithaca Tues-
day in their home opener 13-4, W&L
extended it’s winning streak to three
games, the longest in three years.

After handling Old Dominion
Athletic Conference rival Randolph-
Macon a week ago Wednesday, the
Generals travelled up to Lancaster,
Pa. to take on Franklin and Marshall
on Fancy Dress Saturday.

Said first-year head coach Jim
Stagnitta before the trip, “The guys
are focused. They know they played
probably their worst game of the
season last year against F&M, and
they want to prove to themselves that
they could play a better game. We
are going up there to do one thing,
and that is to beat Franklin and Mar-
shall.”

Goals by senior midfielder Jim
Jones tied the game at 1-1 and fresh-
man David Schiminger, the Generals
led 2-1 with 7:30 to go in the open-
ing quarter. From there, however,
F&M scored the next three goals of
the quarter to take a 4-2 lead after
the period.

Junior gbalie Tom Costello had a
rough first quarter, giving up four

goals. Said Stagnitta, “Tornmy strug-
gled in the first quarter. He had his
worst game in college last year
against F&M, and they were letting
him know about it — jawing at him
before and during the game. But he
hung tough."

Junior middie Todd Garliss
brought the Generals to within 4-3 to
start the second quarter off an assist
from sophomore Wiemi Douoguih,
and Jones tied the game at 4-4 with
8:08 to play in the half.

After another F&M goal, junior
attaclanan Mike Moseman tied the
game for W&L at the half with his
goal 2:12 before intermission.

In the third quarter, the Generals
took control of the game. Sophomore
attackrnan Jeff Roberts scored with
12:52 left in the quarter to start the
ball rolling, and Douoguih and Mose-
man continued the roll with goals of
their own to give the Generals an 8-
5 lead heading into the final quarter.

After F&M scored to make it 8-
6, Roberts and Jones tallied the fm-
ishing blows to extend the lead to

10,-‘6. F&M got two late goals, the
last ‘with 1:16 to play, to make it a
10-8 game, but the Generals held on
for a 10-8 win over 13th ranked
F&M.

Said Stagnitta after the win, “We
beat a team that had more individual
talent than we did. We won because
we played a better team game than
they did and executed everything we
wanted to.”

Costello rebounded from his slow
start to record 20 saves, including 14
in the second half. Jones had a car-

 

eer—high three goals to lead W&L,

The Fllng-tum Phl, March 15, 1990

while Moseman had two goals and an
assist and Roberts added two goals.

Tuesday, on a sun-drenched Wil-
son Field, the Generals were red-hot
and could do no wrong in the first
half.

Senior attackrnan Chris Mastro-
giovanni set the stage when he batted
a pass from junior Clark Wight into
the net just 1:50 into the game to
open the scoring.Wight scored with
11:22 left, and Jones closed the first
quarter scoring with a goal 38 sec-
onds from the end to give the Gen-
erals'a 3-0 lead.

In the second quarter, Douoguih
scored 14 seconds in and followed
that with another goal with 10:55 left
to make it 5-0. Roberts scored 32
seconds later to make it 6-0. Jones
scored his second goal with 8:17 left
and Garliss (7:25), Mastrogiovanni
(7:01) and Schirninger (1:38) finished
the first half scoring.

Mastrogiovaririi opened the third
quarter by registering his third hat
trick of the season, off Moseman’s
third assist of the day. After that,
however, the W&L offense took a

Track lcc

The 1990 Washington and Lee
track and field season commences
Friday as the men try to continue
their 36 straight victories while the
women's team, only in their second
season, look to make a name for
themselves.

The Generals will host Roanoke
College, Eastern Mermonite College,
John Carroll University, and Bridge-
water College, and men's head coach
Norris Aldridge believes this will be
his tearn’s toughest challenge all year.
The action begins on the track at
3:00 p.m.

Besides the six-year unbeaten
streak, the men have accumulated
nine Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference indoor and outdoor titles in
that time. However, the same suc-
cess will not come easily as

evidenced by a second place finish to
Lynchburg at the ODAC Indoor
Championships in February. It was
the first time since 1984 the Generals
failed to win the indoor crown.

In the past, Aldridge’s teams has
relied on depth as one of the key

Aldridge acknowledged that the depth
is unproven, but claims that is still
there.

Said Aldridge, “We don’t have a
lot of proven depth. The good thing
is we have a lot of potential. That’s
going to be key, and I think it will
be even more of a key than in the
past.”

However, to ease the transition, a
group of top performers are returning
to this season’s squad. Leading that
group are the 1990 tri-captains ‘of
senior Wes Boyd, junior David Mar-
tin, and senior Phillip Sampson.
Boyd, after struggling with injury last
season, has returned strongly to top
sprinting form, winning the ODAC
60-yard dash during the indoor sea-
son.

Martin also had a fine winter
season, winning the ODAC indoor
mile with a 4:27.6 clocking. Samp-
son, who has twice won the ODAC
pole vault championship, will look to
add a third in his finalseason.

Aldridge also will look to senior
Scott Williams and junior Carl Gil-
beit for support. These two versatile
performers combined to compete in
12 events in last years ODAC out-

4 ‘ The Washington and Lee base-
ball team opened the 1990 season
with five games in ﬁve days, wirming

, two and losing three.

“We are so young that I didn't
ow what to expect. So many of
'ur guys hadn’t played much be-
ore,” head coach Jeff Stickley said,
eferririg to the fact that W&L lost
‘ e players to graduation.

Z W&L opened the season with a 4-
_ loss against Holy Cross on Thurs-
yday, and was then smothered by West
‘ Virginia Tech on Friday, 11-4, before
‘coming back to sweep WVa. Tech in
‘ii doubleheader on Saturday, 15-4 and
.15-4.

, L After four straight home games,

the Generals traveled to Bridgewater

‘on Tuesday and dropped a 3-1 deci-
,sion to open the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference season.

On Thursday, with the score tied
at 2-2 in the ninth inning, Holy Cross
loaded the bases with nobody out and

#proceeded to score two runs to take

(a, 4-2 lead.

The Generals scored one run in

4 their last at bat when sophomore T.J.

‘Daly’s ground out to second brought
home freshman Mike Steinbrook. For

gthe game, sophomore outfielder Brian

‘Harper was 3-for-4 at the plate and
scored a run.

, Sophomore pitcher Steve Momor-
ella, last year's W&L Freshman Ath-
‘lete-of-the-Year, gave up four runs,
‘two in the first inning and two in the
ninth, but allowed only one hit from
Vthe second through the eighth inning
while registering eight strikeouts.

“Steve pitched a heck of a

~ game,” Stickley said. “We gave
ourselves a chance to win and that’s

(what we're looking for. The biggest .

thing for us to work on is to make
sure we score enough runs. We left
la lot of people on base.”
4 On Friday, WVa. Tech scored
four runs in both the third and sixth
‘innings on their way to an 11-4 vic-
tory. The Generals picked up three
runs in the fifth inning on back-to-
‘back doubles from junior first base-
man J.T. Swartz and junior outfielder
Tim Wheeler. Swartz was 2-for-3
with two rims scored.

“They just hit the ball better than

ASPORTS

us,” Stickley said “They smashed
it around pretty good. They deserved
to win that one.”

The first game of Satiirday’s
doubleheader against the Golden
Bears saw the Generals erupt for 15
runs as 11 different players crossed
the plate.

The second game was a bit
tighter. W&L picked up five runs in
the first two innings and held on to
win, 5-4.

“I was pretty pleased with the
way we came back to win the dou-
bleheader, especially on the day after
Fancy Dress,” Stickley said. “We
had some great pitching.”

That pitching came from senior
David Smith and sophomore Toby
McCoy. Smith won the first game
and earned a save in the second, after
McCoy had been pitching a perfect
game going into the fourth inning.
Smith also went tliree-for-six at the
plate on Saturday.

“He (Smith) was just in a groove,
he was ahead (in the count) of a lot
of hitters," Stickley said. “He’s

If you told someone in passing on
the Colonnade that the Washington
and Lee women’s lacrosse team was
going to fare well against national
powerhouse Washington College on
Tuesday, tliey' would have first called
you crazy and then reminded you that
a year ago, Washington College de-
feated the Generals 15-3.

But that was last year.

To open the 1990 campaign, the
Generals gave head coach Jan Hath-
om every reason to smile about what
this season could bring to Lexington
despite losing 12-8.

“I was really pleased with the ef-
fort. We played hard for all 50 min-
utes. I think we learned a lot from
playing a team of Washington’s cal-
iber in the first game. It was a great
learning experience that will definitely
help us during the season,” said
Hathom.

always been a good hitter. We ex-
pect him to do that, so his perform-
ance wasn't a real surprise. He’s
going to have a good year.”

At Bridgewater, three unearned
rims spelled defeat for W&L. The
loss sent the Generals’ record to 2-3
(0-1 in the ODAC). Daly went 3-for-
4 on the day. Momorella struck out
four and allowed only six hits as he
pitched his second complete game of
the season, but lost for only the
second time in his collegiate career.

“He’s pitching great. He’s our
number one pitcher and he’s going to
get the tough assignments. We just
couldn't score enough runs to help
him out,” said Stickley, noting that
W&L stranded 10 runners on base.

W&L has a full list of ODAC
games lined up. The Generals played
Eastern Mennonite today and will
play Randolph-Macon in a double-
header at Smith Field on Saturday.
Next week, W&L will host Hampden-
Sydney on Tuesday and journey to
Lynchburg on Thursday.

before junior co-captain Shawn Wert

scored with 19:15 left in the opening

period. Sophomore Kimberly Bishop

followed Wert’s goal with one of her ,
own to make it a 3-2 game, but WE

answered with two goals from Sarah

Coste, who scored the first five goals

for WC.

Bishop, last year’s leading scorer
with 25 goals, added two more first
half goals, the second with just one
second to play in the half, to keep
the Generals in the game, trailing just
7-4 at the half.

Washington College scored the
first two goals of the second half to
take a 9-4 lead before Bishop got
back into the scoring column for
W&L. Her goal with 15:25 to play
made it 9-5.

From that point, WC scored two
more unanswered goals to open up
what would prove to be an in-
surmountable 11-5 lead. The Gen-
erals made a late run to cut it to 11-
8 on goals by Bishop (7:24), Wert

Bishop led W&L with five goals.
Sophomores Whitney Hopkins and
Melissa Manko had assists. Sopho-
more Erica lrigersoll made 11 saves
in goal for the Generals.

Said Hathom, “We played as if
we felt we could win. The team
should be proud of how they played
after being romped last year. I think
if you take away some first game
nervousness, then this game could
have very easily been 8-8."

. Despite the fine effort, Hathom
still thinks the team has a long way
to go. “We still have a long way to

go, but if this first effort is any in-
dication, we stand a very good
chance of doing well this season.”

The Generals travel to take on Old
Dominion Athletic Conference rival
Bridgewater today and will play host
to Western Maryland Saturday on
Liberty Hall Field.

Anyone attending the Minority
Student Association/Ornnicron Delta
Kappa panel discussion last night
expecting a consensus of opinion was
probably disappointed. Although no
speciﬁc conclusions were reached, the
evening did shed light on the topic of
cultural diversity.

The question addressed was,
“Does the university promote or
inhibit cultural diversity?” Specific
areas such as W&L’s curriculum,
social life and admission policies
were under scrutiny.

Panelists discussing their percep-
tions of multiculturalism at W&L
were Assistant Dean of Students
Kenneth Ruscio, Minority Student
Association President James Ram-
beau, Interfratemity Council President
Kevin Nash, Executive Committee
President Willard Dumas, former
International Club President Jennifer
Spreng, Spectator Editor Paul
Legarde, and Assistant Professor of
Sociology Anne Wortham.

At first, the speakers summarized
their ideas about cultural diversity.

Dean Ruscio stressed his feelings
that diversity already exists on carn-
pus. “Greater diversity is an oppor-
tunity; not a problem,” he said. He

W&L|FE

Grappling with cultural diversit

also remarked that multiculturalism
enriches Western society, therefore,
knowing about other cultures helps us
understand our own. “We must dedi-
cate ourselves to making every person
in the W&L community feel at
home.”

James Rambeau disagreed with
this view. He feels that Washington
and Lee has not been doing nearly
enough to promote multiculturalism
because everything “tends to be seen
in black and white.” He beleives
that, while many traditions are good,
traditions that impede the success of
the University must be changed.
Rambeu said that, while the
curriculum is generally euro—centric in
content, it is slowly changing.

Willard Dumas took the same
general viewpoint. The University’s
effort in attracting culturally diverse
faculty members has disappointed
him. Dumas’ main point was that
bringing diverse students here is not
enough. Dumas feels that, once
students are here, they seem to be
isolated by the social structure of our
campus.

Kevin Nash addressed the entire
idea behind multiculturalism. “We
should not change our current cur-
riculum, but rather augment it by
offering the study of other cultures
for those who are interested.” On the
socialissue. Nash said that while

‘dent has the desire

The Rlng-tum Phl, March 15, 1990_

fraternities rriight have inhibited cul-
tural diversity in the past, that the
problem is in the process of being
corrected. He did not mention what
steps were being taken.

Tak.ing Nash's idea further, Paul
Legarde vocalized his thought that we
live in a society based upon European
ideas. “It is not surprising that Amer-
ican universities are euro-centric, and
American culture demands that they
be that way. W&L is working very
hard to bring diverse students and
professors on campus.”

Dr. Wortham, who is a new profe-
ssor at W&L, hoped that the panel
discussion would help her discern the
extent of cultural diversity on cam-
pus. She said, “Generally, I have
problems with the concept of multi-
culturalism because it tends to be
used to undermine the legitimacy of
cultural pluralism. The term should
not be used to put the intellectual
heritage of the West on the defen-
sive.” _

Wortharn believes that, because
America has a pluralistic culture all
of its own, we should strive toward
intellectual independence, instead of
multiculturalism.

Jennifer Spreng bases her view-
point on the thought that every stu-
to fit in at
Washington and Lee. “Everyone has
the right to feel good about thenisel—

ve .

Similarly to Dean Ruscio, Spreng
believes that the community as a
whole must work to promote different
cultures. “Relations between groups
at W&L are not perfect, but they
tend to be resolved with much less
acrimony than at so many other
schools,” she said.

Once each panelist had a chance
to'speak, ODK Vice-President Shawn
Copeland, who served as moderator,
opened questions to the audience.

While many issues were address-
ed, the University’s admissions and
recruitment policies were discussed in
depth. Currently, the University’s
admission process does not adhere to
any percentages (sex not included),
rather it strives for the widest diver-
sity possible. This often results in
special recruitment of minority stu-
dents. One glaring question
concerning the acceptability of this
policy seemed to remain: Should
there be a blind admissions policy?

According to Rambeau, one of the
event’s organizers, the goal of the
evening was to “promote discussion
and get a general assessment of stu-
dent opinion on the topic.”

This is the second year the panel
discussion has been conducted. Last
year's discussion followed similar
lines. Will the third?

ROTC conducts exercises with VMI

From News Releases

Operation —- Winter Warrior pitted
Washington and Lee‘s ROTC Mink
Battalion and Virginia Military
Institute’s New Market Army ROTC
Battalion seniors against the under-
classmen for three days of training
exercises in George Washington Na-
tional Forest earlier this month.

The first ever joint exercise, held
Feb. 3-5, helped prepare the third-
year cadets for Advance Camp at Ft.
Bragg, N.C., this summer, said New
Market Army cadet Chris Larlee. The
cadets were also able to put into
practice the tactics they learned on

 

 
  

the fall training exercises at Fort Lee,
N.J.

Upon reaching George Washington
National Forest Friday evening, the
Winter Warrior Platoon moved
through the’woods to the first patrol
base. From there, the platoon divided
into three different squads and con-
ducted security patrols of the area in
order to secure the perimeter, recon-
noitcr terrain, and gain information
about the enemy, the seniors from the
two units.

The long night, complicated by
little sleep and frequent frreﬁghts
with the opposing forces, came to an
abrupt end when the cadets were
awakened at 5 a.m. Both sides we-.re

of the night’s activities was held and
the units prepared to move to the
new patrol camp.

Upon arrival at the second camp,
the squads conducted reconnaissance
patrols of an enemy base, to be
raided in the morning. The informa-
tion returned by the scouts was used
by cadet leaders to determine the
direction of attack and locations for
assault, support and security elements
for the raid. '

Completing the recon of the raid
site, the three squads joined together
for a platoon ambush of enemy for-
ces using a nearby trail. After the

turned to the patrol base and rapidly
moved to a large tent for the evening.
There they were able to eat a hot
meal and change into dry clothes.

Movement to the raid site began
on Sunday morning at 3 a.m. Again,
the platoon had to move through the
dark, wet forest, led by cadet leaders.
The raid was short, ﬁerce and suc-
cessful.

Love Natives
grock Daytona

,f,Fiji wins national competion

By Mike Badger
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee can once again
be proud to call itself the home of a
national champion.

Two years ago the university
claimed a national championship
compliments of the men’s tennis team,
but the latest championship has come
in a slightly different arena.

Last Sunday the Fiji Love Natives,
winners of W&L’s fourth annual Lip-
Sync contest, and finalists in the na-
tionwide SAMS (Students Against
Multiple Sclerosis) “Rock—a-Like"
contest, were chosen as the top act in
the nation.

The Love Natives, one of six acts
chosen by SAMS to perform live on
MTV from Daytona Beach, were the
favorite act of viewers across the na-
tion. ~
The voting was done entirely on a
call-in basis, and when it was over the
Fijis had accumulated 31 percent of
the votes, beating the runner-up group
from the University of Missouri,
which got 28 percent of the votes, ac-
cording to Love Native Tyler Suiters.

“All the credit goes to the people
here at W&L,” said Suiters. “From
wh  heard, people were voting four
anﬁive times.”
z7""‘We couldn’t have done it without

W& ,” said Love Native Larry Par-
ker, “especially the Fij.”

Voting from the Fiji house was ex-
ceptionally strong in support of the

one.

In January they warded-off stiff
competition to win the W&L Lip Sync
contest, which raised over $2,000 for
SAMS. A tape of their act, in which
they lip-sync Morris Day and the
Tirne’s “Jungle Love”, was then sent
to New York, according to Gerald
Darrell, organizer of the contest at
W&L. There it was viewed by a panel
of SAMS judges,said Darrell, and was
selected as one of the top six acts in
the nation.

The group left W&L for Daytona on

March 15, according to Suiters, where
they trained for two days before the
final competition.

Aside from some extensive tanning
and lifting, the group had a chance to
perform their act at Daytona’s 701
club the night before Sunday’s final,
according to Suiters.

With that performance under their
belts the Love Natives felt comforta-
ble, said Suiters, and when it came
time to perform in front of the camera
they weren’t nervous at all.

“Once we saw everyone else’s acts

good chance at winning,” said Love
Native Kirk Sohonage.

“We were just anxious to get out
there and do our thing,’ ’ said Suiters.

Once their performance was over
the group knew they had done well.

. “We, felt , great, about it,”. said
Suiters. “We knew we did a great
job.”

“The girls there loved our gyrat-
ing,” said “lead singer” Jim Ambro-
sini. “The women were just throwing
themselves at us.’ ’ '

When the announcement was made
that they had won, none of the Love

Natives were particularly surprised.

“No one was going to beat us, we
knew that ” said Parker, “although we
were a little afraid of the Go-Gos [the
group from the University of Alaba-
ma], they were big and intimidating.”
“The group from Akron which didn’t
perform might have given us a run for
the money,” said Sohonage.

According to Suiters, the Akron
group was there for the competition,
but could not perform because MTV
couldn’t get the rights to their song
“Summer Lovin” from the Grease
soundtrack.

Meanwhile, the reactions back in
Lexington to the Love Native victory
were very emotional.

“The exuberance we all felt was
somewhat akin to winning the World
Series, the Superbowl and the NCAA

basketball championship all wrapped.

in one,” said Nash.

“Just the realization that we were
national champs-it was incredible,”
said Fiji pledge Matt Cook.

“Everybody was really pumped,”
added Johnson. “We were all so
proud to be Fijis.”

For the Love Natives, one of their

biggest thrills came in representing
W&L, according to Ambrosini.

“I think our victory was good for
the school,” said Ambrosini. “How
many times does a small school like
W&L get represented on national
television? ’ ’. . .

“It’s not just a victory for us,” add-
ed Suiters. “It’s a victory for the
whole school.”

The Love Natives said they also en-
joyed meeting a number of television
personalities who were in Daytona,
especially MTV V-J Julie Brown.

Washington and Lee’s Law School was
ranked 25th in a recent survey of the best law
schools in the United States, according to the
March 19 issue of U.S. News and World Report.

The 175 American Bar Association-
,, accredited schools that award J.D. degrees were

included in the survey, which picked Yale as
O the number one law school in the nation.

The survey, which was conducted by the

l Washington ofﬁce of Market Fact, Iric., and

, which included surveys of business, medical

and engineering schools in addition to schools

5 of law, were compiled for U.S. News during

  

the winter of "1989-90. Schools were ranked
based on their degree of student selectivity,
placement rates after graduation, instructional
resources available to students, and their
academic reputation among other schools and
law firms around the country.

Overall rankings were determined by
converting the scores for each attribute into
percentiles and weighting the scores
accordingly. The highest total score was labeled
a “I00,” and the other schools were ranked by

converting their scores to a percentage of the

top school's score.

Randall Bezanson, dean of the W&L Law
School,‘ said he was contacted by U.S. News
several months ago and asked to send some
objective data about the school. Bezanson said

he did not hear from U.S. News again until he
received a press release of the survey results
Friday.

Bezanson said when he was first contacted
by U.S. News he was not all that impressed by
the undertaking. Nationally, law schools are so
diverse with respect to size and structure that it
is really difficult to make comparisons, he said.

However, considering that this is the first
survey of this nature that U.S. News has
conducted, the magazine did, in his estimation,
“A pretty good job basing their evaluations on
a number of factors.”

W&L’s Law School is by far the smallest
of the institutions included in the top 25. Most
of the larger, public institutions are affiliated
with public research institutes, which enhance

their reputations, Bezanson said. Washington
and Lee warranted its rank strictly on the basis
of its own merit, he said.

The U.S. News rankings will have little
effect on admissions at W&L, Bezanson said.

“Washington and Lee’s Law School is
already widely regarded as a uniquely fine,
small law school. The survey results only
confirm this fact,” he said.

John Falk, president of the W&L Student
Bar Association, said the rankings could have
some impact on students at the law school,
particularly as they search for jobs. The study
confirms the quality of W&L and enhances
graduates’ potential for finding a job with a top
firm, he explained.

Delta Gamma National Rep-
resentatives have responded to the
Panhellenic Council of Washington
and Lee University ,by' approving a
proposal for Delta Garrirna’s coloniza-
tion and acknowledging W&L’s Delta
Gamma Interest Group, according to
Panhellenic President Nancy Mitchell.

“We’re looking forward to working

with Delta Gamma in their estab-
lishment at Washington and Lee,”
Mitchell said.

Delta Ganirna’s acceptance of the
Parihelleriic proposal enables the PHC
to acknowledge the legitimacy of the
Delta Gamma Interest Group, which
had petitioned the PHC for a voice on
the council. Vicki Nixon, Delta Ga-
mma National Director of Expansion,
agreed with the PHC that the interest
group should be allowed to have a
voice, but not a vote, on the PHC until

colonization. In response to the
group’s official acceptance by Parihel-
lenic, a DGIG representative was pre-
sent at the PHC meeting Tuesday
night. -

The PHC will also allow initiated

VMI faculty
say yes to
coeducaﬁon

By Jason Kelley
Staff Reporter

Sixty—three percent of Virginia
Military Institute faculty members re-
sponding to a poll favored admitting
women to the all—malc school, but a
majority of them also support State
Attorney General Mary Sue Terry's
efforts to defend the single sex
policy.

According to a news release from
Blair Tumor, president of VMI’s
chapter of the American Association
of University Professors, most of the
respondents who favored admitting
women were in favor of Tcrry’s legal
battle with U.S. Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh, who had set a Feb.
20 deadline for VMI to agree to
admit women or face a sex dis-
crimination lawsuit.

Several of those instructors who
favored Tcrry’s lawsuit but also fa-
vored admitting women felt that
deciding the matter in court would
“at least clarify the legal issue,”
Turner said.

Terry's suit, filed in the U.S.
district court in Richmond on Feb. 5,
claims that VMI’s exclusion of
women is constitutional under the
Education Amendments of 1972 and
the Civil Rights Act of 1964

“Admission of women to the
VMI undergraduate program is not
necessary to provide equal op-
portunities for women within the
Virginia system of higher education,”
the lawsuit said.

A similar survey was done at
Washington and Lee in 1984, before
it began admitting women. At that
time, over 65 percent of the faculty
members who responded to a poll by
a sociology class said that they “stro—
ngly believed that W&L should be-
come a coeducational institution.”

A majority of instructors at the
time believed that coeducation
“would be in the best interests of
W&L with regard to attracting aca-

Cultural diversity,
at what sacrifice?

Last Wednesday, a panel convened to discuss multi-
culturalism at Washington and Lee. Most of the panelists
« seemed to agree that the university is taking steps in the
V right direction, but there is room for improvement. James
Rambeau, president of the Minority Student Association,
said he believed the school could do more.

Dean Kenneth Ruscio, representing the university, said,
“greater diversity is an opportunity,” and “we must
dedicate ourselves to making every person in the W&L
community feel at home.”

Equally important as attracting minorities to the faculty,
"A is attracting women to the faculty. Some candidates might
be wary of the student attitudes. Others may not like
' faculty attitudes. In this case, W&L itself was the barrier
_ to attracting a woman.

‘ The journalism department has just added a new
' faculty member for next year. Toward the end of their
search, the ﬁeld of candidates had been narrowed to
four —— two men and two women. Brian Richardson
accepted the position last week. The ﬁeld of women
narrowed itself.

One of the woman candidates decided W&L and
Lexington were not for her. She preferred a larger school
3 in a larger setting. If the size of Lexington and
._ Washington and Lee frighten candidates away, what other
characteristics of the town and school might prohibit
attracting qualified people?

Should Washington and Lee hire less-qualified minority
and women candidates just to have them on the staff?
No. Should Washington and Lee diversify the perspective
of the faculty by hiring minorities and women? Yes, if
the candidate’s different perspective makes up for the lost
experience.

Much can be said for a diverse faculty, and the same
, is true of making the whole community comfortable, but
the first objective of recruiting both faculty and students
should be their potential to excel in their fields.

The Fij

On the subject of cultural diversity, the Exotic, Erotic,
Narcotic Fiji Love Natives deserve a Laurel, and Hardy
handshake for their stellar performance in Daytona Beach.
Those who say their win speaks well of the school are
right.

The Fijis say thanks

Now that we've returned from our national tour, we would like to
take this opportunity to thank everyone at Washington and Lee who
watched and voted for the Fij on Sunday. We were really quite amazed
at the number of people who said they called in for us. Some of them
are going to have some pretty big phone bills next month.

Nevertheless, it was a close contest and all your votes helped make '
the difference for us. We would have won by a bigger margin if
Sohonage thrusted in synch (just kidding, Kirk).

All in all, the trip was a total blast and intellectually stimulating, not
to mention a few other stimulations.

We were psyched to win and could not have done so without the
support from our school and feel its a victory for all of us, although
we're keeping the car.

Thanks again everyone.

Raising kids — Sbar style, 

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

Lately I have been thinking about
the good old days when America’s
youth was carefree, happy, and did
not eat satanic breakfast cereal in-
volving Teen-age Mutant Ninja Tur-
tles that were spontaneously generated
from a nuclear waste plant. Yes read-
er, today’s youth are in such serious
trouble that they leave us only two
possible alternatives: either we kill
them and throw them, along with
their electronic big wheels, into the
Grand Canyon or I write a long
serious article chastising them but
offering no solutions. Since we have
neither the time nor the inclination to
haul all of America's youngsters off
to Arizona, it looks like we’d better
settle for the article.

To begin with, our elementary
school kids are really stupid. Now
back when I was in elementary
school (10 years ago), educators were
talking about how we were playing

kickball while kids in Japan were de-
signing computer chips, so everyone
agreed that we were pretty stupid.
But nowadays kids are so stupid that
educators, having forgotten the Japa-
nese, now compare American youth
with domestic reptiles.

According to these professional
educators, many of whom are them-
selves reptiles, Johnny, who is the
average American 10-year-old, doesn’t
know what state he lives in or the
difference between water and dirt or
that his name is Johnny. In compari-
son, Guadalupe, who is the average
10-year-old Iguana house pet, knows
his name well enough to come when
you call him in from the backyard
for his piano lessons.

The mentioning of Guadalupe’s
piano lessons has presented a perfect
transition to our next big subject:
music. Ten to 15 years ago, disco
music was the big craze and everyone
who was even remotely cool owned
a strobe light and a collection of
disco singles. This is a pretty embar-
rassing fact but at least everyone got
over it. But kids these days are get-

ting into something that they’ll proba-
bly never get over: New Kids On The
Block, which is a group of pre-pubes-
cent males who dance like John
Travolta on speed and dress like
transvestites.

The ideal evening for the typical
12-year-old girl is to go to a New
Kids concert, scream at the top of her
lungs, and rip off her clothing. Sure,
women did the same thing for Elvis,
but that was different because Elvis
was cool. At least he was full grown.
The New Kids have at least five years
before they even have to shave. Our
only hope is that they lose their
popularity when their voices change
during puberty or that they get heavi-
ly into drugs during high school and
quit singing.

Perhaps the worst problem with
the youth of today concerns the tele-
vision. When I was younger and
spending the majority of the day rot-
ting my brain with television, at least
I watched good programs. With clas-
sic heroes like Woody Woodpecker,
the Three Stooges and Tarzan, I was
inculcated with the positive values of

throwing food, drinking beer anti”. 0

having a good time with scantily clad
women like Jane.

Kids today have television heroes
like the Smurfs and Pee Wee Her-
man, whose sexual orientation is
questionable. While the Smurfs seem
heterosexual (though its debatable
because there’s only one female
member in the group) they live in an
unrealistic egalitarian communal com-
munity. If Woodie the Woodpecker
spent a day with the Smurfs, he’d
probably steal everything, have his
way with Smurfette and drive the
other smurfs, even Happy Smurf, to
suicide.

Because of the fact that my pet
iguana, Guadalupe, has just reminded
me that Woody the Woodpecker is
now on television, I am compelled to
end this article immediately. If any
readers have young siblings, I suggest
that they lock them up in a room
with Cheerios, Led Zeppelin albums
and Three Stooges videotapes and
leave them there until they grow up.
Or, if you have time, take them on a
little trip to the Grand Canyon.

Ortega is still better than Samoza

MY VIEW
By Alan Heinrich

In her “My View” last week, Ms. Spreng was
certainly correct to point out that moral outrage
sometimes blurs one’s reason. However, a greater
threat to one’s rational judgement is the eagerness
to interpret important events based on ideological
agendas — agendas developed not for the purpose
of understanding the truth, but for perpetuating
fundamentally unjust and undemocratic power
structures. Both she and Mr. Brubaker demonstrate
this unseemly eagerness in their columns.

Both Ms. Spreng and Mr. Brubaker seem to
have misplaced over 100 years of history by
suggesting that Nicaraguan poverty was a Sandi-
nista invention. Though enjoying low inﬂation,
high agricultural rates and a healthy trade surplus,
in the twilight of Somoza’s Nicaragua there_ were
over 200,000 landless peasants throughout the
country. The fact that the Somoza family owned
15 percent of all the land in Nicaragua gives
poignant insight into the realities of the time,
illustrating the ephemerality of so many economic
indicators when the distribution of resources is as
askew as it is in Central America. Although Ms.
Spreng agrees with me that “there has been much
to indict" in U.S. relations with Nicaragua, she
fails to see two very important facts: 1. Relations
with Sorrioza were not an isolated and unfortunate
incident — rather, they were part of a systematic
policy of interventionism, militarism and dependen-
cy; and 2. There has not been official recognition
of — much less, repentance for - this policy; in
fact, it continues to this day. Therefore, there is
ample reason to harbor deep suspicions regarding
this latest chapter in the United States’ affront to
Nicaraguan sovereignty. Let's take a closer look at
the history of this system.

Since the 19th century, Latin America has
figured in the North American scheme of things
in one simple way: as the cheapest possible suppli-
er of natural resources. The latter part of that
century saw the United States and Britain hood-
wink Central Americans with various railroad
swindles, culminating in the staggering accumula-
tion of property by Minor Keith’s infamous United
Fruit Company. Ever since those times, the United
States has viewed Central America with that
peculiar possessiveness the only word for which is

imperialism.

Let me illustrate this. In March of 1950,
George Kennan —- a high-level State Department
official, formulator of “containment theory,” which
provided the major theoretical justification for Viet-
nam, yet was a theory which he first developed
under the name of “Mr. X” (presumably ashamed
to sign his name to it) — had a meeting with U.S.
Latin American ambassadors in Rio de Janeiro.
During this meeting, Kennan outlined U.S. policy
objectives in Latin America. The first of such
objectives was “the protection of our raw materi-
als." I needn't comment on the force of the pos-
sessive adjective here. Kennan concluded, “The
final answer might be an unpleasant one, but... we
should not hesitate before police repression by the
local government... It is better to have a strong
regime in power than a liberal government if it is
indulgent and relaxed and penetrated by the Com-
munists.”

The Latin American people
themselves could have dem-
ocracy only if they chose
their leaders from within the
pool of candidates accept-
able to the United States.

The force of Kennan’s statement, of course, is
that the parameters of the Latin American political
spectrum are to be set by the United States. The
Latin American people themselves could have
democracy only insofar as they chose their leaders
from within the pool of candidates acceptable to
the United States. That is, Latin American sover-
eignty was to be undermined as a matter of policy.

In fact, the United States has not strayed from
the course that Kennan outlined. In 1954, the
Eisenhower Administration planned and funded the
overthrow of the Arbenz government of Guatemala
— which came to power through one of the fairest
and most open and democratic elections in that
nation’s history. Thanks to the agrarian reform
legislation of Arbenz — which was to redistribute
only the unused portions of the United Fruit
Company’s ill-gotten land holdings, for which they
were to be compensated by the government —
Washington began to cry in unison: “Communist!"
The incoherence of this reasoning can be seen

in the remark which John Peurifoy, the U.S.
ambassador to the country, made to a Guatemalan
official shortly before the invasion: “Agrarian
reform had been instituted in China... China is
today a Communist country.” Since then, Guate-
mala has witnessed a bloodbath. Less dramatically,
the United States has had El Salvador militarized
to the point where there is no possibility of an
Arbenz ever coming to power: as the October
bombing of the headquarters of the labor union
FENESTRAS demonstrates, political opposition is
swiftly eradicated by the army — the same army
that has received over $4 billion of U.S. aid over
the past 10 years.

For Ms. Spreng, Carter apparently represented
a change in such policy. Rebutting my assertion
that Carter actually continued the great U.S. tradi-
tion of “philotyranticism” with regard to Somoza,
Ms. Spreng responds, “Even Henry Kissinger
stated that ‘the Jimmy Carter Administration active-
ly participated in the overthrow of the Somoza
government.’ ” (Even Henry Kissinger?? What
does that mean? Ms. Spreng is well aware that
Kissinger is a Republican crony). However, when
Kissinger accused Carter of helping to topple
Somoza, what he really meant was that Carter did
not embrace the murderer with the same enthusi-
asm as did past presidents. It is true that Cages‘
temporarily cut Somoza off from U.S. economic
aid after the most horrifying human rights abuses
were reported. But it was soon restored. Just two
months before Somoza was driven from Nicaragua
forever, Carter helped Somoza receive a $66
million loan from the International Monetary Fund.
Ms. Spreng must think that Carter intended to
drive Somoza out of Managua by beating him with
dollar bills. Thus, Carter no less than other presi-
dents bears responsibility in the $1.5 billion debt
Somoza left behind: a figure that dwarfs Carter’s
aid packages to the Sandinistas.

None of this is to suggest that Ortega is a great
guy. But it is doublethirik at its worst to equate
him with Somoza: Ortega may be a bully, but
Somoza was a murderer. More importantly, Mr.
Ortega’s actions are not done in my name. Why
are Ms. Spreng and Mr. Brubaker so outraged by
the sorry state of things in Nicaragua, when our
government has been funding armies whose abuses
of human rights make Ortega and his men look
like Jeffersonians? This funding is conducted by
leaders who claim to be representing us: that
makes us all accomplices to murder.

Program aids term paper blues

By Jason Kelley
Staff Reporter

A Washington and Lee student
who ﬂunked Computer Science 111
twice, has created a program that will

vmake writing term papers much easier

for students all over the country.

Sophomore Mike Adams is in the
ﬁnal stages of completing a com-
puter program that creates bibliogra-
phies and outlines, writes in foreign
languages, unnoticeably lengthens
papers, scrambles confidential doc-
uments and allows the user to “talk”
to the computer in plain English. He
expects the program to be released
next month,

Adams has written his program,
called Thesys, to work in conjunc-
tion with the WordPerfect word pro-
cessing program. He said he plans to
begin selling the program in about
three weeks here on the W&L cam-
pus and across the nation.

Adams, who is currently on leave
from the university to complete the
project, said that Thesys will sell for
$50 retail, but W&L students will
probably be getting a discount.

“Advance sales from other uni-
versities and businesses will already
allow me to return to W&L without
parental ﬁnancial support,” he said.

The program can create bibliogra-

phies in any of the four recognized
standard forms. It takes entries from
different types of sources and orders,
punctuates, spaces and alphabetizes
them in a few seconds.

In a demonstration, the program
ordered and alphabetized a bibliogra-
phy with 171 entries in just three
seconds.

Thesys also creates outlines by
setting up the format and automati-
cally placing entries.

For students, though, the most
exciting feature is that Thesys will
almost unnoticeably expand the size
of a paper by up to 25 percent. By
altering the spacing between certain
letters and characters within words (a
process called keming) the program
can make a 10 page paper fill 12
pages without any noticeable sign of
alteration.

In some applications of the pro-
gram, the user is able to “command”
the computer without using the tech-
nical prograrnrning language. The
user could type in “Please set the
right margyn [yes, misspelled] to
about three inches,” and the comput-
er would be able to understand and
execute the request.

Adams said, “This feature makes
it a convenient program for the non-
technical user. It’s pretty much idiot
proof.”

Adams said he has spent approxi-

mately 2,500-3,000 hours writing the
program.

His parents provided the more
than $11,000 it has cost to get in-
struction manuals, a cover design, and
the computer diskettes printed, he
said.

Adams decided to develop and
market his program idea on his own.
The president of WordPerfect corpo-
ration encouraged him to do so even
though WordPerfect does not itself
develop programs from sources other
than their own research and develop-
ment department.

Adams said he has representatives
at W&L who are helping him sell the
program, and he hopes to get one
student from each state to help him
sell Thesys to universities all over the
country.

The program still has some bugs
and is being proofread by W&L
German Professor Robert Young-
blood, who is an expert on biblio-
graphical resources and who has been
a major contributor to well known
bibliography style manuals.

Adams hopes to have the copy-
righted program ready for release
within three weeks, but he said he
would rather make sure that all the
problems are ironed out and release it
late rather than have users encounter
problems.-

Thesys also allows the user to

type with characters from four differ-
ent foreign languages and to use
scientiﬁc symbols not present on the
regular WordPerfect keyboard.

Adams said he discovered using
WordPerfect macros (groups of com-
mands defined by the user in the
program) to create his own programs
last summer while working as a
programmer at the Army Institute of
Chemical Defense.

Even though he failed Computer
Science 111, he says the approachto
programming logic and management
that he learned in Computer Science
110 was an invaluable tool in allow-
ing him to create Thesys.

Adams has plans for follow-up
programs. but does not want the
nature of these disclosed because he
fears that competitors, especially large
software companies, will be able do
develop these ideas faster than he
can.
Adams said he lost his enitire
program in mid-January because his
diskette went bad. Because he did not
have a back-up disk, he said he had
to reprint the whole program from his
memory and the minimal notes he
had been keeping.

Adams said his real interest is not
programming, but foreign language
literature. He said he would like to
get a doctorate in one of the romance
languages and be a college professor.

MSA to hold weekend conference

By Cathy Lopiccolo
Staff Reporter

Minority students, prospective
students and alurrmi will gather this
weekend for Washington and Lee's
second Minority Student/Alumni
Co erence.

vxccording to James Rambeau,

Association, the purpose of the con-
ference is to bring the alumni closer
to current students and the campus in
general.

“In the past several years we've
found that minority alumni have not
returned to campus or have been less
active than other alunmi. A confer-
ence of this sort is to bring the alum-
ni closer and to generate interest in
what’s going on,” Rambeau said.

In addition to current students and
alumni, 22 prospective minority stu-
dents have been invited to participate
in the weekend activities, according
to Rambeau.

The prospective students arrived
today and attended a reception this

afternoon where they had the oppor-
tunity to meet current W&L students,
especially members of the Student
Recruitment Committee, Rambeau
said. Tomorrow the students will
attend classes and have interviews
with the Admissions Office and pro-
fessors who teach subjects in which
they are interested.

Two panel discussions are sched-
uled for tomorrow afternoon after the
12-18 expected alumni arrive.

“The alumni will participate in a
panel discussion on the significance
of a Washington and Lee education
and what it can do for the students.
They can give their perspective on
student life during their own time,”
Rambeau said. '

The deans of students will con-
duct a second discussion on campus
life in general, and a reception for
alumni and students is planned for
that evening.

While the prospectives are being
interviewed Saturday morning, Anece
McCloud, Associate Dean of Students
for Minority and International Affairs,
will chair a discussion with current

demically qualified students.”
However a majority of both stu-
dents and alumni responding to that
poll felt that W&L should not be-
come coeducational, citing costs and
a loss of distinctiveness as the two

major disadvantages of admitting
women to the school.
According to Tumer’s report,

some of the faculty responding to the
VMI poll who opposed coeducation
were openly hostile to those who
supported it. One professor suggested
that any faculty member who did not
agree with VMl’s admissions policy
should leave the college; another
stated that simply taking the poll on
the issue was a disservice to VMI.
Other respondents believed “the

constitutional issued were clear, that
women had to be allowed admission
to the state school,” according to
Turner.

Many faculty members commented
that admitting women would mitigate
some of what the respondents per-
ceived as abusive practices in the
barracks.

A spokesman for VMI said the
school probably would have no offi-
cial comment on the poll, and Tur-
ner’s statement said the AAUP is not
a part of the school administration.

“Its actions and opinions can not
be interpreted as constituting any part
of VMI’s official position,’ ’ according
to the release.

 
     

students and alumni on recent campus
events. That night the MSA is spon-
soring a dinner-dance and band in the
General Headquarters for the minority
students and alumni.

The weekend activities will end
Sunday morning with an informal
brunch in the University Center be-

fore the prospective students leave
campus.

While prospective minority stu-
dents will continue to visit the cam-
pus annually, Rambeau said after this
year, the Minority Students/Alumni
Conference will be held only every
four years.

EC

from page 1

The deadline, originally set at
March 12, was last week extended to
March 19, because the EC had re-
ceived only 12 applications including
only two from the undergraduate
campus.

First-year law Rep. Julie Alagna
said that not enough notices were
posted at the Law School, and some
law students did not know that the
applications were due.

EC Vice President Jonathan
Sheinberg feared that extending the
application process further might not
give the committee time to accom-
plish something this year. He also
noted that most of the applications
received were from law students.

Applicants must sign up for an
interview outside University Center
Coordinator Carol Calkins’ office.

Cold Check Committee Chairman
James Rambeau presented a budget
report to the EC.

The Cold Check Committee cur-
rently stands in deﬁcit by $349.82,
according to the report, but expects to
recover $668.99 from liabilities,
yielding a positive net balance of
$319.17.

Rambeau reported that $73.50 of
$113.50 in fines has been collected,
with one fine outstanding.

The Cold Check Committee was
unable to cover some checks written
by an international student from Ke-
nya who has withdrawn from school,
according to Rambeau. Assistant
Dean of Students Kenneth Ruscio

plans to contact the former student’s
family with a list of debts.

Sophomore EC Rep. Caroline
Wight reminded Rambeau that the EC
voted that the Cold Check Committee
levy no fine less than $5 so that
students would take ﬁnes more seri-
ously. Fines as low as_$2 were previ-
ously levied.

Rambeau added that he would
soon resign from his post as chair-
man so that he may participate in the
Washington Term Program. He rec-
ommended that the EC consider Cold

Check Committee Secretary Robert-

Shelton to fill the chairman post.

The Fancy Dress Committee post-
poned their budget hearing until next
Monday. Sheinberg said the FD Com-
mittee’s financial totals will be more
definite by then.

Liberty Hall Volunteers did not
appear for their budget hearing. The
EC unanimously voted to freeze their
account.

The Minority Student Association
and the Volleyball Club will present
budget reports to the EC next Mon-
day.

Dumas extended congratulations to
Women’s Field Hockey and Rugby
for their successful weekends.

“I'd definitely like to congratu-
late the Fiji Love Natives,” added
Dumas, regarding Fiji’s win at the
MTV Lip Synch on Sunday. “I'm
eagerly waiting to hear from Mr.
Hartog to see what ...[Fiji’s appear-
ance] will do for admissions.”

School.

His topic will be “Mind Over
Machine: Calculatlve Rationality
vs. Human Expertise.”

Dreyfus holds the BA. (with
highest honors in philosophy),
M.A., and Ph.D. from Harvard
University. Prior to joining the
Berkeley faculty in 1968, Dreyfus
taught for eight years at the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology.
He has served as visiting professor
at Technische Universitat in
Austria and Frankfurt University
and has directed N.E.H. Summer
Seminars and Institutes at the Uni-
versity of California at Berkelely
and Santa Cruz.

The author of three books and
numerous articles, Dreyfus has
been frequently interviewed by
print media and radio and tele-
vision stations around the world on
programs such as NOVA, CBS
EVening News with Dan Rather,
and the British Broadcasting Cor-
poration, among others.

His numerous honors and
awards include Phi Beta Kappa, a
Fulbright Fellowship to Belgium, a

French Government Grant, Baker
Award and Harbison Prize for
Outstanding Teacher, a Guggen-
heim Fellowship, and, most recent-
ly, an NEH Basic Research Grant.
During his visit to W&L, Drey-
fus will also meet with undergrad-
uate students in the cognitive
science and philosophy classes.

“Mystical Experience Among
Contemporary Egyptian Sufis”
will be the topic of a lecture at
W&L tonight at 8 p.m. in Room
221 of the Commerce School.
The lecture will be given by Val-
erie Hoffman-Ladd of the Uni-
versity of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign.

Hoffman-Ladd has recently
returned from a two-year research
leave spent in Egypt, where she
lived among Muslim mystics
(“Sufis”) and their living saints.
She has studied at the American
University in Cairo and at L’Uni-
versite de Tunis. SHe received
her doctorate in 1986 from the
University of Chicago in Arabic
and Islamic Studies.

With her dissertation, “The

Religious Life of Muslim Women
in Contemporary Egypt,” to soon
be published, Hoffman-Ladd is at
work on another book, Mystics and
Saints in Modern Egypt.

Delta Gamma’s PHC rep-

resentative, freshman Kimberly Mar-
cott told the PHC that DG is already
planning another Open House for
unaffiliated women. Aside from the 16
members of the interest group, there
will also be initiated members of Delta
Gamma present from other uni-
versities such as James Madison Uni-
versity.

According to the agreement be-
tween DG and the PHC, Delta Gamma
will have the opportunity to begin co-
lonization as early as next fall. This
colonization is plarmed to be as close
as possible to the men's fall rush
dates. Following colonization, DG
will also have the option to “contin-
uous open bid,” accepting pledges at
any time following the formal coloni-
zation period through Dec. 5, 1990.
Mitchell said DG will then participate
in Formal Winter Rush with the three
established sororities.

know our school was out there.”

According to Mitchell, by enabling
DG to colonize in the fall and rush in
the winter, the PHC is giving DG the
opportunity to establish themselves on
the campus of Washington and Lee
before having them compete with the
three sororities in formal rush activi-
ties.

Quota, the number of bids each
group are each able to give out during
the formal rush period, will be split
four ways, Mitchell said. Delta Ga-
mma will not be required to include
the girls who are interested in coloniz-
ing before winter rush in its quota, al-
lowing DG to give out the same num-
bcr of bids as the other three sororities
during formal rush.

PHC also agreed that following
Winter Rush, only Delta Gamma
should have the opportunity to “con-
tinuous open bid.” Each of the three
sororities willingly consented to this
limitation since all three chapters were
well over “total,” Mitchell said.

4 Last Friday, the Washington and
Lee men’s track team gained two
‘victories but had their winning streak
.end at 38 straight meets while the
women’s team won three times before
‘being edged by John Carroll Univer-
_,sity.
' The Generals ﬁnished second to
g1Old Dominion Athletic Conference
rival Bridgewater College, perhaps
‘their toughest opponent this year. The
men were able to outpoint other
ODAC foes Eastern Mennonite and
4Roanoke College. The ﬁnal tally for
the men on the day was BC 80,
rW&L 50, EMC 33, RC 6.

There were a number of first
’place ﬁnishers for head coach Norris
,Aldridge. Senior tri-captain Wes Boyd

was a double winner, ﬁnishing ﬁrst
4 in both the 100 meter and 200 meter
rdashes. Senior Scott Williams won
the 400 meter run, junior tri-captain
lDavid Martin won the 1500 meter
\ run, and sophomore Charles Edwards
"ﬁnished ahead of the pack in the
t 5000 meter run. The lone field event
winner was senior tri-captain Phillip
Sampson in the pole vault.
4 The Generals also experienced a
little bad luck as junior Carl Gilbert

strained hamstring. Gilbert normally
competes in six events. Said A]-
dridge, “Carl’s absence hurt us be-
cause he gets a lot of points for the
team.” The extent of Gilbert’s injury
is not yet certain, and Aldridge is
taking no chances. Gilbert will not
run this weekend at the Liberty Invi-
tational.

The women had a very impressive
day as well losing by only eleven
points to John Carroll University, but
handily defeated Easterh Mennonite,
Bridgewater, and Roanoke. The
women’s ﬁnal results were JCU 87,
W&L 76, EMC 34, BC 6, RC 0.

Senior co-captain Beth Stutzmann
won four individual events to lead the
Generals, including helping the 4x100
relay team break a school record.

Juniors Sandi Dudley and Lisa Jay
also contributed to the strong team
performance. Dudley won the javelin
and Jay was the discus throw winner.

Head coach John Tucker noted
junior co-captain Sarah Bolte’s ﬁne
performance in her 400 meter school
record breaking performance and her
leg in the 4x100 meter relay.

This weekend the men travel to
the Liberty Invitational facing mostly
Division II and low Division I
schools. The women will travel to
Davidson for the Davidson Invitation-

With the scored tied at 0-0 in the
ﬁfth inning of yesterday's baseball
game against Hampden-Sydney, soph-
omore ﬁrst baseman T.J. Daly had
some advice for his Washington and
Lee teammates.

“You play to win, you don’t play
to play,” he said, his voice loud
enough for all at Smith Field to hear.

Thus inspired, the Generals moun-
ted two offensive threats in the sixth
and seventh innings after their de-
fense came up with three quick outs
to halt a bases-loaded threat by the
Tigers in the top of the sixth inning.

Yet, W&L did not win on this
day, the first full day of spring, as
Hampden-Sydney (5-5) picked up
runs in the seventh and eighth in-
nings to escape with a 2-0 victory
despite another ﬁne pitching per-
formance by sophomore Steve Momo-
rella. It was W&L’s fourth loss by
two runs or less this season.

The loss dropped the Generals’
record to 2-5, 0-3 in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference. In a week’s
schedule shortened by poor weather,

. W&L’s only other game was a 7-5

defeat against Eastern Mennonite this
past Thursday. Saturday's double-
header against Randolph-Macon was
rained out.

Yesterday, Harnpden—Sydney, the
defending ODAC champions, loaded
the bases in the sixth on a hit bats-
man and two singles. H-SC then tried
a suicide squeeze, but Momorella
threw the lead runner out at the plate.

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

From Staff Reports

For the second year in a row,
the entire Washington and Lee
swimming contingent returned to
Lexington with Division III All-
America honors.

Sophomore. Jay Smith could
not continue his unbeaten string,
but he could continue his string
of All-America years. Smith ﬁn-
ished seventh in the nation in the
100-yard backstroke at nationals.
Smith earned All-America honors
for his top-eight ﬁnish, but he
was not alone.

Joining Smith was sophomore
Chip Nordhoff, who earned Hon-
orable Mention All-America hon-
ors in both the 200 freestyle and
the 200 backstroke, and the W&L
freestyle relay team of Smith,
Nordhoff, junior Jim Dunlevy and
sophomore Doug Brown, which
earned Honorable Mention All-
America honors in the 200, 400
and 800 freestyle relays.

The Washington and Lee
men’s lacrosse team saw their
three-garne winning streak snap-
ped with a loss at Roanoke on
Saturday and then stubbed their
toes Wednesday against Lynch-
burg.

After falling behind 8-0 to
Roanoke in the first half, the
Generals could not come all the
way back for the win. A second

half rally fell short. The Generals
had closed to 9-6 on a goal by
senior Chris Mastrogiovanni, but
could get no closer as the Gener-
als fell ll-7. Sophomore Wiemi
Douoguih led W&L with three
goals and junior goalie Tom Cos-
tello made 14 saves.

On Wednesday, the Generals
again fell behind late at Lynch-
burg and had to make a come-
back. Trailing 6-4 with two min-
utcs left, the Generals rallied to
tie the game at 6-6 and force a
sudden death overtime, but Bill
Becker scored with 1:32 to play

The Washington and Lee
women's lacrosse team salvaged a
tough week with a win Wednes-
day against Longwood College,
their ﬁrst win of the season.

W&L dropped two games by
three goals against Bridgewater
and Guilford and fell to national
power Western Maryland 7-2. On
Wednesday the Generals dropped
Longwood 8-7 to improve their
record to 1-4, 0-1 in the Old

The Washington and Lee golf
team ran its record to 10-1 last
week.

then flied out to rightﬁelder John
Durant. After receiving the relay
throw from Durant, Daly made a
perfect throw to catcher Chris
Kavanagh to nail the runner at the
plate for the double play.

As the Generals returned to their
dugout, head coach Jeff Stickley
repeated I‘ tly’s words, “Play to win,
don’t play 9 play.”

W&L 1 an proceeded to get two
of its four ‘ts when Durant lined a
single to le‘ ﬁeld and sophomore

' Brain Harper xlooped a single to left.

They were b(; *1 stranded on base.

The Genera s other scoring chance
came in the SC, /enth after Kavanagh
started the inning with a ground
single to left field. Sophomore Pete
Castiglione, running for Kavanagh,
reached second on a failed pick-off
attempt, but the inning ended when
he was tagged out in a rundown after ,
rounding third base too far on senior
Kirk Thompson’s single.

The Tigers scored in their half of
the seventh on a‘single, a stolen base
coupled with a throwing error and
another single.

The lead increased to 2-0 in the
next inning by way of an unearned
run.

With the loss, Momorella’s record
fell to 0-3, although he now has 15
strikeouts in three complete games.
Momorella was 6-0 last season.

This past Thursday, W&L held a
3-2 lead over after three innings, but
ended up losing 7-5.

“I thought we played fairly well,”
Stickley said. “But we couldn’t hold
the lead and then we couldn’t score
at the end. We’re getting people on
base, but we‘re just not scoring

effort falls short again, 2-0

them.”

Eastem Mennonite scored two
rtms in the ﬁfth inning and three runs
in the sixth on three doubles.

W&L countered with two runs in
their sixth inning and started a come-
back in the eighth with the score 7-
5, but an interference call on junior
Tim Wheeler, who was hit with a
thrown ball while coming into second
base, produced two outs.

The Generals then loaded the
bases when junior J.T. Swartz and
Thompson got singles and senior
Bobby Rimmer reached ﬁrst on a
throwing error. But that was as far
as the threat would go and the game '
called after eight innings because of
inadequate light.

“I didn't think it was a very good
call,” Stickley said, referring to the
interference ruling. “But that's the
way it goes. It didn't lose the game
for us, we should have been ahead at
that time.”

Sophomore Pete Klingelhoffer
went 2-for-4 and Kavanagh was 1-
for-3 with a triple and two runs
scored.

“We just need to score runs when
the opportunity arise and play better
defensively, but that will come with
playing,” Stickley said.

“The next couple of weeks will
tell a lot. We’re excited about play-
ing,” he added.

In the next couple of weeks the
Generals will play a lot as yester-
day's game kicked off a series of
nine games in 11 days. W&L played '
at Lynchburg today and will host
doubleheaders against Emory and ,
Henry on Saturday and Randolph- ‘
Macon on Monday.

Women start season with _
six consecutive ODAC wins;

By Matt Jennings
Staff Reporter

If the ﬁrst few matches of the
spring season are a gauge for how
successful the Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team will be this
year, then the remaining Division III
teams should look out.

Coming off a 9-1 fall record, the
Generals opened the week by soundly
defeating Old Dominion Athletic
Conference foes Hollins 9-0 and

On Friday, the Generals faced
Randolph-Macon in Ashland. The top
six, consisting of junior Kelly Mar-
tone, senior Teresa Southard, junior
Kathy Leake, freshman Mason Smith,
sophomore Brannon Aden and fresh-
man Elizabeth Hancock all won,
clinching the match. The doubles
were cancelled due to darkness, giv-
ing the Generals a 6-0 win.

The Generals continued
eastward trek on Saturday with a stop
at Virginia Wesleyan, with the results
much the same as in Ashland. W&L
tumed back VWC 6-3, sparked by a
three set win by Martone at No. 1.
Martone pulled out the win in a tie
breaker, 6-2, 3-6 7-6 (7-5).

Southard, Leake and sophomore
Muriel Foster, recovering from ill-
ness, all followed with straight set
wins, and after Smith lost a tough
three set decision, Aden clinched the
win with a convincing 6-0, 6-1 win.

Smith and Foster got the lone
doubles win for the Generals at No.
2 with a 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) win.

On Tuesday the women returned
home and stayed in town long
enough to defeat Lynchburg 7-2,
winning ﬁve out of six singles to
clinch the win. Yesterday, the Gener-
als ran their record to 6-0 with a 5-
3 win over Roanoke, getting the
deciding win from the No. 3 doubles
team of Southard and Hancock.

The Generals are playing without

ODAC player of the year, in confer-
ence matches. Since Stroman will be
away in the spring and will not be
able to compete at the ODAC cham-
pionships, Martone is playing No. 1
in ODAC play.

The men's tennis team started
slow, but rebounded with wins over
Wheaton and ODAC rival Lynchburg.

The Generals kept their Division
III record unblemished with a 6-3
win over Wheaton and a 7-2 win
over Lynchburg. The lone loss was to
Division I William and Mary 7-2.
The men’s record stands at 3-2, 2-0
in the conference.

The men entertain four tough
opponents next week, with all the
matches being at home. The women
continue to travel, having only three
home matches this year, and will take
on Catholic, George Mason and Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman's College.

Entertainment Columnist

Twenty-ﬁve confirmed dead. A
ninety—f1ve minute movie. It works
out to a killing every 3.8 minutes.
But the twenty-ﬁve dead doesn’t
include the twenty-odd attacks, runn-
ing the spectrum from broken bones
to fractured skulls. Factor in all acts
of violence, and our ﬁgures rise to a
violent act every 2.1 minutes. Talk
about redeﬁning ‘ ‘action-packed. ’ ’

I want to thank two people who
played a role in gathering these stat-
istics: (1) Jon Sheinberg, who saw
the film earlier in the week and sug-
gested I keep a body count; (2) Julie
Salerno, who bravely stayed in her
theater seat and kept a running count
as I furiously wrote my notes. We
ain’t talking a Walt Disney produc-
tion here folks, but rather the new
thriller Hard to Kill.

The only kind remark I can make
is that the movie is a cliche-ridden
orgy to violence. Steven Seagal plays
veteran cop Mason Storm. When the
movie starts we find super-cop Storm
on a lone stakeout. Our intrepid hero
discovers that the mob wants to blow
up a Senator’s plane and then put

Southern

E

their own man — Vernon Trent —
into power. Yikesll Storm is acciden-
tally discovered. He swiftly escapes,
breaks up a liquor store robbery, and
then saunters home. Ooops!!I The
bad men discover that Storm was
spying on them and decide to snuff
him out.

Fortunately, the villains don't
move in on the Storm residence until
we meet Storrn’s cuddly son. And his
loving wife. And his beautifully-
decorated home. ,

After we have our heartstrings
tugged, the bad guys wreck the
house, murder Storrn’s wife, shoot
Storm’s sweet little kid, and blow
away Storm. Switch to hospital emer-
gency room where his teary-eyed
police commander informs the underl-
ings that Storm “had more honor and
guts than the entire department put
together.” I was reaching for my
milk-duds, not my hankie, at this
point.

But holy heroics, Batman — Storm
isn't dead!!! He is merely in a seven-
year coma and in the capable hands
of nurse Andy Stewart (Kelli Le
Brock). Stewart is a beautiful young
women who upholds the dignity of
the medical profession. For example:

Comfort

The second armual “Southem Comfort Invitational” will take place on

Wednesday, March 28th, at 8:00 p.m. in General Headquarters.

The

Invitational, which is hosted by the Washington and Lee musical group
Southern Comfort, will feature the V.M.I. Sentinels from Virginia Military
Institute, Baldwin Charm from Mary Baldwin Women’s College, Virginia
Belles from the University of Virginia, and Washington and Lee’s own Jubi-

Lee.

Publicist and Southern Comfort member Franklin Daniels said that

“Southem Comfort wants to showcase

the fact that there are a lot a good,

small, musical groups around. It was a big hit last year, and this year we are

hoping it will be more popular.”

Each group will have around twenty-five minutes to perform, with
Southern Comfort opening and closing the Invitational. There is no charge

for admission.

The Ring-tum Phl, March 22, 1990

Hard to Kill deserves an early death

while removing the comatose Storrn’s
sheets, Stewart stares at his crotch
and tells him to wake up “because
you have soooo much to live for.”
What poignant words! What a haunt-
ing script! The twenty thousand dollar
question — can you predict what
transpires next?

If you guessed that Storm remains
a vegetable, then you deserve sitting
through this movie. Of course Storm
instantly wakes up. The rest is as
believable as my Grandfather's golf-
ing stories: Storm makes a speedy
recovery from seven years of sleep-
ing. How, you ask? The answer is
simple! Storrn’s former Chinese in-
structor taught him in the ways of
healing herbs and soothing acupunc-
ture (I guess his old master didn't
have time to enlighten him in the
ways of “The Force").

But all work and no play makes
for a boring movie, so Storm allows
time in his hectic training schedule to
bed the hot-blooded Nurse Stewart.
Then back to his herbs. Finally, after
burning tons of incense and jogging
up mountain peaks, Storm decides to
go after the bad guys. Let's give the
man a hand.

The rest of the film is too painful
for me to completely recall. However

I do remember one bit of splendid
dialogue that changed my life for-
ever — when Storm tells the
gangsters that the “anticipation of
death is worse than death itse .”
Utter dismay overcame me.

There are three points I want to
make concerning this philosophical
gem: (1) Storm plagiarized this pas-
sage from Aristotle; (2) Mason Storm
has been reincarnated and knows
what it is like to die; (3) the sentence
should be changed to “the only thing
worse that the anticipation of death is
watching this film." :

Even for the genre of “the shoot-
them-up cop thriller,” this film is an
utter embarrassment. Steven Seagal is
the product of the Clint Eastwood
school of acting. This is not to be
taken as an anti-Eastwood remark,
but there is only ONE master of the
stoic one-liner. Real—life wife Le
Brock should stick with making
shampoo commercials.

Peppers will grade this atrocity a
“D-” and recommend that the film
be sentenced to an early box office
death. I am filled with shame to have
seen this movie, and I can only count
the days until The Hunt for Red Oc-
tober arrives in Lexington.

‘I do declare! Bring me another mint julep’

Czar Willie III has declared martial law in an unprece-
dented move to retain power and keep it out of the hands
of the proletariat.

Czar Willie III

...siezes power in bloodless coup

and gagged, while staff ﬂoozie Genienne Mongno was
taken to Willie's harem.

“I like to think of Washington and Lee as my back
forty,” said Czar Willie, tipping his panama hat as he
called for the dissolution of the Executive Committee and
the administration.

According to conﬁdential sources within the regime,
his mad majesty has indentured former-president John
Wilson and ﬁred the remaining administrators. Sadly,
however, Dean Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins drowned in a
consuming puddle before he heard news of his dismissal
(see story elsewhere on this page).

Immediately following the coup, Willie tossed Wilson
out of the Lee House and into shackles.

“I need a palace ﬁt for a king, if I am to be general-
isimo,” Willie was heard to exclaim as he put his foot on
Wilson, who was bringing him a mint julep.

When asked about the recent Law School secession,
Willie answered, “Eh, let’em go. Who needs that ilk.”

One Willie supporter, Robert J. deMaria, a professor
of journalism, said “I su.re am glad old Willard did this
before the Student Telephone Union did.”

STU representatives failed to comment on the Dumas
coup because they believed the moves fail to affect their
independent organization.

But Field Marshall John Fialcowitz is reported to have
mobilized troops against the STU stronghold, though
defenders have taken the war cry “Death Before Dumas.”

Czar Willie, formerly Willard L. Dumas III, had
recently been voted out of office by the slim margin of
oh, say, 50 percent. The sheer disappointment, sources
say, caused Dumas toigo nose-first into a mental abyss.
Sources say Dumas woke yesterday morning believing he
was Czar Willie III, the sole male descendant of that
autocrat of autocrats, Maurice “Baby Doc” Duvalier, last
ruler of the peaceful tropical isle of Haiti.

Trustees double tuition and say, ‘suck it up’

By a W&L News Office Flack

Washington and Lee's Board of Trustees
voted Monday night to double the school’s
tuition for the 1990-91 school year, according
to unnamed sources.

“Everyone knows students at W&L can
afford to pay at least $20,0()0 a year in
tuition,” said Trustee Beverly DuBose. “If
they want ﬁnancial aid, they can sell their
damn BMW's. They’re just gonna have to
suck it up.”

In October, W&L was named a “best
buy" in liberal arts colleges by U.S. News
and World Report. The magazine quoted
W&L's yearly tuition as $10,100. Under the

plan expected to be passed by the trustees at
their next meeting, that ﬁgure would be
doubled to $20,200. ' ’

“Who the hell wants to be a best buy?”
demanded DuBose. “If you want a best buy,
then go to Wal-Mart and get a nylon leisure
suit for $2.50. If you want a W&L education,
you better expect to pay through the nose just
like everyone else.”

According to a source close to the trus-
tees, who asked that his name not be printed
in this story because of possible violent
attempts at retribution, the trustees have not
yet decided what to do with the windfall of
money the increase will bring.

Among the many plans currently being
allegedly considered is the construction of a

new performing arts center where Liberty
Hall now stands.Upon completion, the theater,
which would cost $4.75 million, would hold
all 75 of W&L’s notoriously rabid drama
fans. It is not known how this new theater
would affect the Lenfest Center, which is
expected to be completed next fall.

“You can never have too many perform-
ing arts centers,” said Coordinator of Capital
Plarming Frank Parsons.

The trustees, according to the source, will
also set aside $45.50 from the general fund to
solve the housing needs of fraternity members
dislodged by the upcoming renovation of
W&L’s fraternity houses.That money will be
used to pay for one night's accommodation in
the Quality Inn in Raphine, Va, located about

20 miles away from campus, sources say.

According to the source, the approximately
70 students‘ displaced in the renovation will
be given the one-bedroom “Bob and Delores
Hope” suite for their own use one night
during fall tenn of next year.

After the money is used up, students will
be left to fend for themselves.

Ironically, the Quality Inn was the scene
of a disastrous fraternity party last spring
which resulted in the wanton destruction of
tables, ceiling tiles and a hot tub, according
to the recently deceased Associate Dean of
Students Leroy C. “I Desperately Need A
New Nickname” Atkins.

To insure that the fraternity members do
not cause any trouble in the Quality Irm,

Lexington Police Ofﬁcer Fred Smith will be
in constant attendance.

“I’m gonna arrest all those little bastards
for drunk in public, resisting arrest, and
public urination," Smith said.

According to DuBose, the tuition increase
will “kill two birds with one stone.”

“If they can’t afford the new tuition, then
students will have to sell their cars,” said
DuBose. “When that happens, there will no
longer be a need for more parking on carn-
pus.”

DuBose said the school has r:-o plans to
add any parking facilities in the future.

“Students wishing to park their cars near
campus are encouraged to go to Harris-
Teeter,” he said.

‘Buddy’ drowns in puddle

By I-I.E. “The real Buddy” Derrick
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee University
Dean of Greek Affairs Leroy “Bud-
dy” Atkins drowned Tuesday in a
puddle between the ODK circle and
the Commerce school.

One student dived into the water
to try to save Atkins, but his efforts
were unsuccessful.

Journalism student Linda McCor-
mack, a bystander who saw Atkins
ﬂoundering in the water, called for
help. An unidentiﬁed student dived in
to try to rescue Atkins, but was un-
able to pull the dean out in time to
save his life.

“I had him, and I could have
saved him, but then he just slipped
out of my hands and was gone,” the
student, thought to be a member of
the Sigma Aqua fraternity, said.

McCorrnack, who is famous in
her home state for ﬁve daring water
rescues of her own, said, “I would
have gone in to save him myself, but
I just didn’t feel like getting wet this
time. The water was too cold."

An ambulance was called and
police divers dragged the bottom of
the puddle for Atkins’ body, which
was recovered about 45 minutes after
he disappeared into the cold, brown
water.

Farnie “points or cash” Lewis, a
cashier in the Co-op, said that she
saw the whole thing happen.

“I was just getting off work and
walking to my car when I saw that
little man trying to wade through the
puddle in his galoshes. He must have
hit a drop off or something, because
all of the sudden he just disap-
peared”

The puddle accumulated after last
weekends heavy rains. Police report

that the water level was four inches
above ﬂood stage at the time of the
incident.

Buildings and Grounds Depart-
ment head James Arthur said that
he’s been trying to get funding for a
new drainage system for the site, but
that University money has been tied
up in other projects.

“Frank Parsons [W&L coordinator
of capital development] promised that
we could have the money to’ ﬁx the
problem as soon as the Lenfest Cen-
ter and the Fraternity Renaissance and
the addition to the science buildings
and the new student center and the
new skyboxes in the Wilson ﬁeld
bleachers and the new sub-Colonnade
parking garage and the twenty story
addition to the C-school were all
completed.’ ‘

FD over budget;
SAB resigns

By Baghwan Ghita
Staff Reporter

The Student Activities Executive ,

Board abruptly resigned Tuesday
when the ﬁgures for the 1990 Fancy
Dress Ball were released.

An anonymous spokeswoman from
the board informed newly ordained,
self-proclaimed czar Willard III that
the graft and corruption within the
organization had “resulted in the
complete erosion of confidence of
anyone, anywhere, in its competen-
cy.”

SAB chairman Charles Conklin,
last seen boarding the SAB Lear jet
housed in Roanoke, had assured The
Ring-tum Phi last week in an inter-
view that the Fancy Dress proﬁt

W&L Law School

By Phillip Morris
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee Law
School‘ seceded from the university
Tuesday night, after a meeting of the
Law School Federalist Society.

In a meeting that lasted three and
a half hours in which 305 law stu-
dents participated, ﬁrst year law
student Mitch Neurock passed around
a petition calling for secession.

Student Bar Association President
John Falk railed against secession,
arguing on behalf of a uniﬁed Honor
System. On Neurock’s petition, Falk
said later, “Neurock’s an idiot, and
we ought to tar, feather, and kick
him out of school.”

Later, after the meeting, Neurock
gathered a group of about 60 law

students who ran around the universi-
ty partially and completely unclothed,
chanting, “No way...we won’t stay!”
After the meeting ended, Law
School Dean “Feelin” Randy Bezan-
son held a three-martini late-night
pow-wow with university President
John Wilson, and members of the
Board of Trustees, who happened to
be in town for a meeting of the
Loyal Order of Water Buffalos.

Wednesday morning the Board of
Trustees issued a simple statement,
“The W&L Law School has been
sold to the law school students on a
cooperative basis for the amount of
$67.12.”

When pressed to answer what the
$67.12 was spent on, a board mem-
ber reluctantly revealed that the board
had bought a keg and lamented their
loss.

expectations...probably a proﬁt two
times in excess of the $70,000 bud-
get.”

But our unnamed source claimed
otherwise. She said, “Unexpected
board expenditures this year will
erode any proﬁts, and probably cost
between $450,000-500,000.”

Among the larger expenses not
itemized in the FD budget were the
long-term lease on the board's Lear
jet, the hand-tailored leisure suits
bought for formal board events, and
the purchase of a suite at the Key-
det-General Hotel for board "recre-
ation". FD Chairman Alex Hitz,
reached at the Keydet-General, re-
sponded to this latest crisis in SAB
management by reﬂecting on his
qualifications for the job. “I do not

Newly self-proclaimed Student
Body Czar Willie Dumas was not as
easy to give in. Shortly after the
statement was issued, Willie gathered
his EC army and formed a protest
line around Bezanson’s house, refus-
ing to let him return to campus Wed-
nesday.

Bezanson managed to make one
phone call before the Executive Com-
mittee’s operations expert, Chris Gib-
lin, cut the phone lines. Within min-
utes the board members showed up
and outnumbered the EC members,
forcing them to give up.

Following the incident, Willie
decided that perhaps Neurock had a
point. “After all,” Willie rational-
ized, “now the SAB won’t have to
allocate any of its budget to the law
goobs.”

 

  

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, April 1, 1990

Armchair Ethics

The problem with journalists today is they have no ethics
at all. For instance, in today’s The Ring-tum Phi several un-
named sources are used. Journalists are expected to consider
the question whether or not to use a conﬁdential source’s
name while writing his story. If the reporter did name his
source, the source could suffer serious retribution from the
people he blew the whistle on, like a fellow named Luigi
who might break his knees.

Washington and Lee’s “young reporter,” Clark Mollen-
hoff, has written extensively on the subject of anonymous
attribution. He believes anonymous attribution allows the
whistle-blower to hide his motives and at the same time give
the accused an upset stomach.

Other journalists pray to the god of the anonymous
source. They use the words “conﬁdential sources say” like
an artist uses paint.

We at the Phi try to walk the line and ﬁnd a place for
the anonymous source, but to use him sparingly because he
steals from our credibility.

The reporter must ask himself if the credibility added to
the story and the value of the information he has only by
this source is worth the risk to this one, single person, who
he’ll probably never ever see again. Well of course it is.
Use his name, run his photograph, walk all over him.

No, no, no. Just joking. As journalists of the highest
order, we would feel obligated to our sources if a sig-
niﬁcant danger for them is involved.

For instance, every unnamed source in today’s paper is
actually the same person. It would be unethical to give his
name, which happens to be E. Amie Fitzgerald. People
could look in the phone book and ﬁnd his address, which is
404 Gaines Dormitory, and his phone number is 464-3683.
We would never wish that on anybody.

Further, we would never
ever run a photograph of
the anonymous source, like
the one to the right. This
picture of Amie was taken
just last year, when he was
a freshman. Nope, purely
un-ethical. Anybody could
recognize him on streets.
Never do that to an anony-
mous source.

Intimate details about the
source’s life are way off
limits. We would never tell
you that Arnie smokes
dope, or that he keeps his
stash hidden in a carved out
thesaurus. He’s not really
worried that the police
might find it, because that’s where he got it. He is worried
about his roommate though, who smokes the stuff like a
chimney.

Well, that’s today’s ethical lesson. We did learn that you
shouldn’t print an anonymous source’s name, unless it’s just

a good friend anyway who won’t mind when Luigi comes
knocking on his door.

Just kidding

Needless to say, we’ve had a helluva lot of fun putting
together this week’s so-called Ring-tum Phi, and we hope
everyone gets a kick out of it. All the facts and quotations
in this issue are ﬁctitious or semi-ﬁctitious ones cooked up
by the Phi staff. The photographs have also been subject to
a little game-playing.

We hope our readers and the victims enjoy our April
Fool’s fun. Remember.... It’s only a joke!

Looking back as a liberal

MY VOO DOO
By Robert J. de Maria

Modern economic historians have recorded a
crazy-quilt pattern of mergers, take—overs and other
ﬁscal shenanigans that would have made the late-
eighties bad-boy Ivan Boesky puff up with pride.
Since the days of Ronald Reagan and George
Bush, Wall Street powerhouses ran rough shod
over the ﬁnancial prairie.

I recall a conversation 10 years ago. I had just
taken an entire class period bemoaning the fact
that merger mania had tainted the hallowed halls of
Ivy. Two universities — one from Japan and one
from West Virginia — had merged. After the class,
I was confronted by an Associate Editor of the
The Ring-tum Phi, Jim Lake. Lake, a senior back
in 1990, was then the neo-conservative voice of

 

My alarmism was nothing
more than another irrational
revisionist tirade fueled by
my sixties permissiveness.

reason. Yes, the same Jim Lake who is now the
Press Secretary for President Jesse Jackson. But, I
digress.

I was decrying the fact that Takei University
had rescued the economically weak Salem Univer-
sity of West Virginia. I expressed disgust that
higher education had become a business, like any
other ﬁrm hawking its wares in the market place.

I recalled that Lake chastised me in front of a
group of fellow faculty members, telling me that
my alarmism was nothing more than another irra-
tional revisionist tirade fueled by my sixties per-

missiveness.

Last week, in The Village Voice, Lake rightly
attacked Georgetown University for accepting “30
pieces of silver" from Donald Trump, becoming
Georgetown/I‘rump-;t1e-University. Serious business
this.

I never thought I could agree with Lake, but
time has wizened us all. The time has come to
unfurl our barmers. Let us call a halt to the post
Reagan-Bush VooDoo economics. We must raise
our voices in righteous indignation. Let us circulate
petitions supporting Lake. In so doing, we must
impress upon President Jackson that the time to

strike is now! He must see the truth: the private _

sector with its philosophy of proﬁts no matter what
the cost is wrong.

Pick up your petitions in The Ring-tum Phi
ofﬁces. The address is c/o the Eddie Murphy Tele-
communications center, Arsenio Hall, Room 200,
Washington and Lee University.

The W&L-VMI coeducation cover-up

2

l  ) Freshmen, P/e..§J]°

 

I’M SKEWED
By Fred Schwab

I've had it with the rumor and
innuendo splashed across the pages
of The Ring-tum Phi. We've been fol-
lowing the story for weeks, but now,
thanks only to the efforts of Keydet
reporter Liz Smith and the VMI
campus news (beige journalism at its
best), the facts have at last been
straightened out.

I saw the article during a break in
the action last Saturday night at Har-
ris Teeter, where I work part-time as
a bag boy. (Do students realize that
most W&L faculty, thanks to lousy

hold second jobs? I earned the job by
virtue of my victory in this year’s
Lip Synch Competition, rendering a
smash version of the larnbada tune,
“Paper or Plastic.") At any rate, as
I waited for a group of Phi Delts
fresh from community choir practice
to panhandle enough spare change to
pay for their six packs of club soda,
my eyes quickly skimmed the account
accurately rendered by the VMI
newspaper.

According to its article, the ern-
barrassing incident did occur, al-
though not, as originally rumored, on
the ski slopes of Aspen. It happened
instead just this side of Virginia
Beach, on the slopes of Mount Trash-
more, the brand new ski resort Bill

to be a Virginia landﬁll project.

It seems that President John Wil-
son of W&L (affectionately known as
“The John”), and Superintendent
John Knapp of VMI (referred to on
the post as “The Head”), were en-
joying the midwinter holiday recently
awarded jointly to their institutions
for “exceptional achievement in
higher education",by. the Board of
Editors of National Review.

Evidently, as the two schussed
down the slope, skillfully avoiding
egg cartons and orange rinds, “The
Head" nearly careened into a dis-
grtmtled group of VMI grads who
identiﬁed themselves as “Men
Against Realistic Legal Association”
(MARLA). A couple of knowing

“The John” had been involved in
some sort of clandestine relationship
with MARLA for some time.

Now, reports the VMI rag (and
WHERE was the Phil), it seems that
a “Pre-Coeducational Agreement”
exists that was jointly signed by
“The Head” and “The John" three
years ago (and updated as recently as
three months ago). The exact details
are sketchy, but the VMI paper sug-
gests it hinges on the following. If
“The John" and his cohorts on the
Hill support the efforts of the federal
government to bring VMI out of the
18th century (where it belongs) and
into the 19th century (where W&L

This grievance is not directed to the stupid
$5 fee of the registrar's ofﬁce, nor the worthless
P.E. procedures that everyone must endure every
registration period. It is not even about the
insidious parking situation in this god-forsaken
town, which we all know is horriﬁc enough. I
want to know why Lexington/Rockbridge County
is one of only 108 counties in the entire nation
to not have a Taco—Bell.

I don’t even want to hear that garbage about
“we have enough junk food in this town al-
ready.” Taco-Bell serves quality, wholesome,
Tex-Mex style food for a reasonable charge. It
seems as though there is an aversion to this type
of food in this valley, a place where Chi-Chi’s
provides the ONLY authentic (HA!) Mexican
food within 350 miles.

It seems to me that, if $13 million can be
sunk into a theatre for eight drama majors, then
$200,000 could be sucked out of some fat cat
alum for a Taco-Bell franchise. If they really
want to help the students survive, I mean live in
this town, then this is the only way to do it.

Last week we, the staff clowns, received our
ﬁrst hate mail from a subscriber. This man was
upset because he was not receiving his Phis in a
timely fashion. We would like to address this
problem before we received any more mail. Our
stand is that we just don’t care.

We’ve already been ﬁred once this year, and
the chances of us getting this job again next year
are about the same as President Wilson not

But, let us assure you (our subscribers) that
harassing us with your petty complaints will not
get you your paper any quicker. The winter is
over and you don’t need the Phis to light your

Cops on top

I am an underclassman, so forgive my naive-
ness, but I think that maybe the Lexington police
are a little over-protective. Last weekend, some
of my girlfriends went with me out on Washing-
ton Street to several fraternity parties. Well, to
make a long story short, I scammed on three
brothers upstairs and was left by my friends.
When they threw me out of the house, a police-
man befriended me and offered to escort me
back to the dorm. When we got back to my
room, he said he needed to come in and secure
the place. Well, embarrassing as it is, he is now
escorting me every weekend wherever I go. I
didn't realize the police force was so “friendly"
here in Lexington, yet I ﬁnd no one will let me
and my escort into their parties. If I end our
little “relationship," I’ll probably wind up in the
slamrner next weekend for solicitation! What
should I do??

Copped out,

will be, I wouldn't mind it so much.

If you didn't run the “Sbar Side” each week,
you'd have more room for real issues, like the

Otherwise, I’d love to see some more reprints

Oh! de toilette

I would like to comment on the dangerous
size of the toilet seats in the University Library.
I mean, you could actually fall into the commode
if you're not careful! Was the builder planning
for beached whales to relieve themselves in there,
or what? I realize that the gross tonnage of the
average W&L student seems to have increased
since coeducation ﬁve years ago, but those cans
were installed when the building was completed
in 1979! I have brought this to the attention of
the librarian, but she said she doesn't have a
problem with their size. Please negotiate a new
contract for smaller toilet seats, or install 2 X 4s
in every stall.

Relieved,

Tiny Tush, '92

P.S. — Is it true that the toilet pipes are directly
connected to the dining hall water supply?

1 Word has come back to a stunned Washington and
Lee campus today from Sunnyview Mental Institution
iii Bismark, North Dakota, where James W. Worth,
University Counseling Psychologist, has been pro-
nounced “clinically insane,” according to head
tiosychologist of the institution, Homer Q. Klinefelter.

,, Worth was sent to the top mental institution in the
nation for treatment following his crazed rampage in
duPont Hall two weeks ago.

, According to university security, Worth was found
running through the halls of the duPont Gallery
wearing only a pair of undershorts and a stethoscope
ip the early hours of Saturday morning.

‘ Apparently Worth was carrying a large picture of
IDean Anne Shroer-Lamont and was screaming at the
top of his lungs “that the true Mona Lisa must be

isplayed.”

y Worth proceeded to tear down various works of art,
denouncing them as “so many pieces of trash,”
pparently in search of proper placement of Shroer-
Lamont’s portrait.

In an interview with university security, Agent
Baner of Parking Control was called in to handle this
sensitive situation.

Baner stated that when he arrived at the scene
Worth was acting “like those crazy horses at the ro-
deo.”

Fearing for his life and that of his fellow officers
is Worth began to hurl pottery, Agent Baner acted
,swiftly to subdue the crazed psychologist with his stun
gun, now carried by all university security personnel.

The Fling-tum Phl, April 1, 1990

Agent Baner writes Worth off.

Agent Baner stated “I didr1’t want to have to zap
the poor dude, but the pottery launching was the final
straw.”

Sources told the Phi that the ROTC department was
told to place their crack anti~terrorist squad on full
alert, in case the situation warranted full
military intervention.

Worth was quoted as saying before passing out as he
tightly clutched Shroer-Larnont’s picture “my passion
for true artwork will not be quenched.”

President Wilson refused the Phi’s request for
corrirnent.

   

 

Renaissance plans to house

r‘ The W&L Fraternity Renaissance,
sfheduled to begin in the spring, has
unearthed some serious logistical and
housing concerns, which were quelled
in a forum Tuesday night by Wash-

to announce that we have cut a deal
with the Virginia Horse Center to
turn the new indoor arena into week-
end housing for road cheese," Wilson
said.

Horse Center spokesperson Bea
Stiality remarked, "This unique
agreement allows for the arena to be
used for housing and showing studs
Monday through Friday, and bitches
on the weekend, with virtually no
alterations."

While Wilson admits some road
women may be galled at the thought

of sleeping in a barn, "most of them, .
don’t know , where they will sleep,

when they arrive in Lexington anyw-
ay, so we are providing a service
long overdue."

Renaissance Color Coordinator
Big Al Schlitz, reached at his Key-
det-General office, said ''I am really
pleased about this agreement. Those
road girls were interfering with my
creative abilities, telling me how to
mix and match my color schemes...it
was just dreadful."

Wilson has transferred the duties
of Fraternity Dean "Bud Man" At-
kins, who died in a freak drowning
incident in front of the Co-op Tues-
day afternoon, to current Minority
Student Dean Aneece McCloud, who
was last seen attending an emergency
meeting with Czar Willie III at his
Winter palace on Washington Street.

When members of the Performing
Arts faculty were asked to comment
on Wilson’s plan, they collectively
remarked, "Gee, won't this room be
great’? We can have receptions and
show art and waste lots of our en-
dowment. This building really is
essential, you know that, don’t you?"

This agreement will commence
with the first annual Alurnni-Road
Bimbo electric jello shootoff to be
held on the upper fields April 26-28.

Hill Ski-lift on the way

By Christopher Robin
Staff Reporter

The Board of Trustees met last
week in a special emergency session
by request of President John Wilson
to discuss the feasibility and the
urgency of constructing a student
transportation system from the Jeffer-
son Street parking lot to the middle
of the Colonnade.

In an interview Pres. Wilson
stated that this plan basically con-
sisted of “sort of a chair lift, like at
ski resorts” to transport students

from the “Corral” to the hill.
Wilson stated that the University
is trying to solve the problem of
drastically reduced student attendance
of classes.
In a random sampling of repeat

Associate Dean of Fraternity Af-
fairs Leroy “Your Buddy and Mine”
Atkins was shocked when he received
news of the mounting debt from His
Imperial Highness Willie III.

Shortly before his untimely

is really gonna hose me. I’m going to
swim in this mess for a long time.”

attendance offenders, most stated that
the reason they blew off many of
their classes was because they were
“too damn tired to walk up the
Hill.”

President Wilson added that this
proposal has him “elated and opti-
mistic” and that he is “willing to
ram it down the trustees’ throats to
get it.”

The most serious problem seems
to originate in the area of the five

Rush moved to junior year

By I.P. Frehley
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee President
John W. Wilson announced yesterday
to the Inter-Fraternity Council his
plans to move rush once again.

This time, however, Wilson- wants
rush to take place in spring term of
a‘ student’s junior year. “I want to
give students plenty of time to adjust
to college before they have to go
through the difficult and confusing
rush procedure,” he told the slightly
bewildered council. “I figure three
years should about do it."

In accordance with these new rush
rules, fraternities are not allowed to

BACKTALK

make contact with prospective rushees
until the third week of April in their
junior year, meaning seniors will not
be able to engage in social activities
with roughly 3/4 of the male popula-
tion at Washington and Lee.

Not wanting to discriminate, sen-
iors will also not be allowed to make
contact with 3/4 of the female pop-
ulation of W&L, as well as most
domestic animals. Confronted with
this fact, Leroy ’Buddy’ Atkins
warned last week, “They’ll have to
learn to deal with it.”

In place of fraternity parties, Wil-
son plans to encourage future stu-
dents to partake in the plethora of
social and cultural opportunities that
the town of Lexington offers.

In addition to this cornucopia of
options, weekend bingo and badrrtitten
tournaments will be added to the ’
social calendar. 

Fraternities did not take the news

well. Atkins was swarmed by per-  j

turbed protestors who petitioned and
argued with the Dean for hours ex-
plaining that witliout fraternities lives
of students would be as dull as his.

Atkins remained unswayed and re-
pledged his support for the president 1

Lex police kill naked student

By Jon Sbar
Staff Reporter

A Washington and Lee student led
Lexington Police Department officers
and Central Intelligence Agency age-
nts on a dramatic cross-carnpus chase
before he was cornered and shot in
Lee Chapel.

Alaskan exchange student Eskimo
Henderson died at Stop-Iri Conve-
nience Store en route to the hospital
at shortly after 11:30 that night.

According to paramedic Sam
Stitches, the ambulance was not driv-
en directly to the hospital because the
vehicle needed gas. “The ambulance
needed gas, plus I was hungry," he
said.

“We never expected the guy to
die like that. What a bummer,”he
said.

Henderson's drama began in the
campus library after he was spotted
foniicating with a Lexington High
School student by Officer Joe Buck-
shot.

“I was patrolling the library when
I happened to look in one of those
private study rooms and saw those
two fornicatin’ right there on the
carpet,” said Buckshot. “The were
grindin’ and ﬂailin’ and carryin’ on
and all in such a debacherous manner
that I thought I was going to be
sick.”

A recently enacted taxation agree-

ment between the Washington and
Lee administration and the Lexington
City Council empowers the police to
patrol the campus in search of stu-
dents who have not paid their car tax.

According to police records, after
Henderson noticed that he was being
watched by a police officer, he disen-
tangle himself from his partner and
ran naked out of the study room.

The female consort, whose name
has been withheld because she is a
minor, said Henderson's departure
was abrupt.

“One minute we're on the carpet
having — well, a good time - and
the next thing I know, Eskimo is
gone,” she said. “He left everything.
His khaki pants, his button down
oxford, his W&L belt, his boots, his
baseball cap, and even his check-
book."

Apparently, Henderson was not
wearing underwear last night in the
library. V

Police said Buckshot pursued the
ﬂeeing Henderson out of the library
and into the commerce school. In the
C—school, Buckshot was joined by
several CIA agents, who were on
campus to recruit students for the
agency.

According to witnesses, Buckshot
and the agents followed the naked
fugitive into the University Center.

With the authorities hot on his

trail, Henderson crashed into a Stu-
dent Activities Board meeting where

board members were busy eating
caviar and drinking champagne.

SAB representative Buford “I take
bribes" Beefcake said that Hender-
son's intrusion ruined the meeting.
“After that unclothed heathen ran
through the room everyone their
appetite and even had to throw out a
perfectly good chocolate mousse."

Henderson left the meeting
through a back door and ran into the
dining hall where the Panhellenic
Eating Club was having lunch. At the
sight of Hendeisori’s naked body, the
women became rowdy and began
pelting Buckshot and the CIA agents
with cottage cheese and low calorie
salad dressing.

“Golly geez,” said a dining hall
employee after the incident, “from
the way those women carried on
you'd think it was the first time they
ever saw a naked man."

Henderson exited the dining hall
and ran across the colonnade into Lee
Chapel where Dean Betty Beluwba
was conducting a date rape clinic.
Dean Beluwba was so enraged by the

intrusion that she grabbed Henderson

by the head.

As Henderson struggled to break
free of Beluwba, Officer Buckshot
and the CIA agents moved close to
the fugitive and fired bullets into the
back of his head.

“Its too bad that kid had to die
that way," said Buckshot, “but I
sure have to admit, I had fun killing
him.."

asuite boxes on top of the stands at
Wilson Field.
The “sky-boxes," as they are
qcommonly known, will resemble the
luxury suites found at major stadiums
‘throughout the country. Each will be
.able to hold four people and will
have a wet bar, television set and a
‘ terrace for outside viewing.
5 “I’ve been toying with this idea
since I began my duties in
“ December,” Walsh said during a
press conference held on Wilson

’Field. “This area desperately needs

sponrs
‘Sky-boxes for Wilson Field

a first-class stadium. You have to go
to Washington, D.C. or Philadelphia
just to sit in a sky-box. Soon, though,
Wilson Field will provide area sports
fans with just such a luxury.”

Walsh said the University would
purchase at least one of the luxury
suites for its own use and the rest
would be sold to local businesses and
industries on a first-come, first-serve
basis. University Cleaners, Lloyd’s of
Lexington, Wal-Mart and Blue-Bird
Bus Lines of Buena Vista have
already expressed an interest in
buying a luxury suite.

“The luxury suites will virtually
pay for themselves. Companies will
buy them and then bring their clients
to watch W&L athletic events,”
Walsh said.

The suite owned by the University
will be used by the faculty and
administration on a rotating basis.

Walsh, who said the cost of
building the sky-boxes had not been
determined, indicated that the
expected demand for the boxes may

persuade the University to build
another set of stands with six more
sky-boxes on the other side of
Wilson Field.

“At .the very least, that would
make the Smythe kid happy," Walsh
said, referring to senior quarterback
Chris Smythe’s complaint that he was
tired of hearing the opposing teams’
fans cheer right behind the W&L
bench.

Walsh explained the the boxes
would not be built until after the
Astroturf had been installed.

“That way we’ll be able to have
nearly every outdoor sport play their
games on Wilson Field. We’ll create
a schedule in which tliere’l1 be a
game of one sort or another on
Wilson Field nearly every day during
the fall and spring. This will give the
owners of the boxes an opportunity
to watch more than just football and
men’s lacrosse,” Walsh said.

Walsh predicted that the only
difficulty he would encounter in
requiring teams to play their home

§Football’s Fallon takes off

‘Staff Reporter

‘ ' Hello Big Apple, here comes Gary
‘Fallon.

1 Last night, the W&L football
tcoach was offered, and accepted the
head coaching job with the National

ootball League’s New York Jets.
4 In the brief phone conversation
with Jets’ General Manager Joe Kay,
Fallon was praised for his accom-
,plishments at the college level and
invited to coach the team beginning
'June 1.

4 “We were impressed with his
credentials, his coaching record and
his haircut,” Kay said in a presss
‘conference this morning.

This is not the first time in the

Fallon called his own press con-
ference this moming, at which time
he announced his intentions to bring
along two of the Generals’ standouts
and the unknown talent to New York
with him.

Fallon said senior standout Phillip
Sampson will be platooning at quar-
terback with former New England
Patriots quarterback Tony Eason.

“He could be the next Joe Na-
math,” Fallon said of Sampson.

Running back Mason Pope will
forgo his last year of college eligibili-
ty for the NFL, Fallon announced
after he said Jets running back Free-
man MacNeil will probably be traded
for draft picks.

games on Wilson Field would come
from the rugby tearri.

“Who has ever heard of a rugby
player not being covered in mud at
the end of a match?” Walsh asked.

However, not everyone in the
athletic department supports Walsh's
plan.

“This guy (Walsh) has only been
here for a few months and already
he's trying to stir things up,” said
Associate Athletic Director Richard
Miller. “In the old days we didn’t
even have bleachers to sit on. Heck,
we didn’t even have football helmets
or pads. Everything in sports is
getting too fancy. I’d like to see a
return to the old days when every
football play was ‘four yards and a
cloud of dust’.”

The proposal for the luxury suites
will be submitted to the Board of
Trustees in the fall, Walsh said.

“If everything goes according to
schedule we should have the luxury
suites in place for the start of the
1994 football season.”

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

From W&L Sports Information

A late edition to ‘the spring
term offerings has just been an-
nounced. Proving that it can
keep up with the times, the ath-
letic department yesterday un-
veiled their plans for a “Lam-
bada" class.

Lambada, the dance craze
sweeping the nation, is a Brazil-
ian form of “dirty dancing.”

When the idea was first prese-
nted at a recent staff meeting,
coach Dick Miller agreed to per-
sonally teach the course. VMI’s
coach Dennis Daly will write the
curriculum.

Miller is very excited about
the idea. “Athletics is not only
good for the body and soul,” he
stated, “but it should also be fun.
Ever since I became a Lambada
freak, I have been waiting to
teach the ‘moves’ to the coeds.”

Register in the athletic office
by Friday, April 6th.

The athletic office is proud to
announce that the Boccie Interest
Group will be legitimized next
fall as a full varsity sport.

Boccie, a sport of Italian orig-
in, is similar to lawn bowling. It
is played on a narrow clay court
with a wooden ball.

To accommodate the new
sport, the old Twombly pool will
be converted to the necessary
facilities. Construction will take
place this summer once the Len-
fest Performing Arts Center is
completed.

Athletics Director Michael
Walsh stated, “I am very proud
that W&L is again on the fore-
front of a new phenomenon.”
He hopes that general education
courses in boccie will soon be
added to the department.

A boccie coach has yet to be
hired. Kayaking lessons, held in
the Twombly pool, will now be
held in the Leroy “Buddy” At-
kins Memorial Puddle in front of
the Co-op.

Toon will be filled by unknown talent
Trey Tune, a W&L junior who has
yet to play out any of his four years

of eligibility.

When asked to comment on
Tune’s credentials, Fallon said “his
blazing speed and steady hands will
make Darrell Green and Deon Sand-
ers quiver in their Reebok’s.”

Fallon said he discovered the

Trustees and company create maior

Plans for a Catch a Bachelor of Arts Degree put into works by committee

By Bambi Stark
Staff Reporter

In an effort to continue its ongo-
ing pursuit of opportunities for Wash-
ington and Lee females, the Board of
Trustees voted unanimously last week
to create a new type of degree just
for them. Graduation requirements for
The Catch a Bachelor of Arts Degree,
or the MRS Degree, will soon be
available to enterprising females who
have no need for boring C-School
classes, but do want lucrative post-
graduate marriage prospects.

Although the armouncernent to
create a new major within the C-
School was just made, a five-faculty
member MRS Committee has already
been appointed to oversee its progress
and implementation into the regular
W&L curriculum by next fall. The
committee, which consists of Dean of
Freshmen Kermeth P. Ruscio, Chem-
istry Professor J. Keith Shillington,
History Professor Jefferson D. Futch,
Mathematics Professor Wayne Dyrna-
cek, and Religion Instructor
Alexandra Brown.

“I think it will be fun,” said

‘ Ruscio, the committee spokesman.

The MRS committee decided that
the major would be based in the
Commerce School for a variety of
reasons. According to Economics
Professor Edward C. Atwood Jr.,
whom the committee chose to assume
the role of MRS Department Head
officially in September, the main
reason for the MRS Department being
based in the C-School was simply
because “the men who will probably
make the most money attend classes
here.” “I am very supportive of this
major, it allows women to be sharks,
not by playing the market, but by
playing the ﬁeld,” Atwood stated.

Of course the availability of the
new degree will also call for several
departmental changes and the commit-
tee has worked at lightning speed
secure them. Because each department
will be asked to implement at least
one or two courses that may be used
by MRS majors for general education
requirements, several Sweet Briar and
Hollins College graduates will be
recruited as Associate or Assistant
Professors in order to accommodate
the new curriculum that will be nec-

essary, according to Ruscio.

The following class offerings or
adjustments are being considered by
the committee and will be voted on
for recommendation to the Board of
Trustees at its April Fool's Meeting
Sunday evening:

Religion: Religion 241, “Women in
Religions,” will be restructured to
cover “How Delilah and Bathsheba
Got Their Men,” an in-depth course
dealing with the devious behavior and
roles created by the world’s foremost
con-women.

Sociology and Anthropology: Profes-
sor David Novack has offered to
teach “Mythical Male Dominance and
the Use of Scarves."

Romance Languages: A series of
graduated workshops dealing with
elementary, interrriediate, and ad-
vanced dirty talk.

Chemistry: A ﬁve-day a week lab
“Makeup Matching and Blending" A
color-analysis Workshop was also
suggested, depending on the degree
of interest.

Journalism: “Library Resources,”
will teach females how to investigate
the backgrounds of their targets and
research their areas of interest.
History: "What Women Looked Like
in the Past,”to be followed by a
“Fashion Current Events” course.
Drama: “How to Fake Anything."

The most dramatic change will
probably be seen in the Commerce
School itself, which will see more
feminine decorations, like pink toilet
seats and an abundance of loudspeak-
ers playing Wham! and Michael
Damian hits.

Depending on the number of inter-
ested women, the MRS Department
could be moved to another location.
Ruscio said that the committee would
deal with that hurdle later, although
the Law School had been recom-
mended as a great MRS hunting
ground.

Right now, the most blatant void
in the program seems to be in creat-
ing domestic or nurturing classes.
Ruscio pointed out that, while the C-
School will handle the most crucial
courses to the MRS major, such as
the Economics Department’s ward-
robe-budget planning course and the
“View Love As a Business” course,
others are desperately needed “Who
do you think is going to do the cook-

ing, sewing, and repeated child birth-
ing and raising after the yoimg ladies
have reeled their senior theses to the
alters?" Ruscio asked.

Although President John D. Wil-
son could not be reached for com-
ment, his wife Anne told The Phi
that she is just itching to teach a
baking course. “I guess I took my
lead from Anne Schroer-Lamont,”
she said. Wilson is referring to a
Schroer-Lamont’s brief, but glorious,
stint as the national winner of the
Betty Crocker cook—off two years ago
that landed her a contract to appear
publically as the new and improved
Betty. Schroer-Lamont grew tired of
the circuit andretumed to her job at
W&L as Associate Dean of Students
after one summer.

Wilson also said that many other
faculty wives were eager to teach
W&L females the “tricks of the
trade” so that they can land husbands
with better paying jobs.

Future Homemakers of America, a
high school domestic club has also
offered to lend its services in the
event that qualiﬁed instructors cannot
be found.

The final requirement before grad-
uation for the MRS major will be the
procurement of at least one bona-fide
marriage proposal with a ring to
prove it. Those with three proposals
will graduate Cum laude, those with
four proposals will graduate Magna
cum laude, those with five proposals
or more will graduate Summa cum
laude and offered an Assistant Profes-
sorship. Candidates must also undergo
a battery of skill examinations, which
will evaluate one's performance and
technique at ten of the university's
fraternities.

An exchange program with the
area women's colleges is being dis-
cussed, however Ruscio said he did-
n’t think it would be acted upon.
“Why should our instructors aid the
MRS majors’ competition?”he asked.

Other problems with the new
majors include protests by stubborn
liberal females. who wish to earn a
MS Degree instead of an MRS De-

The Phi

gree and the faction of homosexual
males on campus, who complain that
they are being discriminated against
by the entire structure of the new
major, which is designed for ;v_o_mgn
who want to attract men.

The idea for the MRS Degree was
presented to the Board by Assistant
Professor of Physical Education Cinda
Rankin and Associate Dean of Stu-
dents Anne Schroer—Lamont, who feel
very strongly about the advancement
of women in society, no matter how,
although both agree that a good mar-
riage is the best strategy.

Rankin, admitted that she joined
the W&L Physical Education Depart-
ment in 1985 with hopes of finding
the right mate. “I’m a sucker for
well-developed chest and abdominal
muscles, what better place to look?”
she said. “I thought the way to make
a man drool was by lifting as much
as he did in the weight room,” said
Rankin, “then I realized, why bother?
I mean it’s so much easier to capture
that special someone with your femi-
ninity, you can easily do that by
participating in activities like cheer-
leading and wearing those cute peek-
a-boo skirts.”

True to her attitude, Rankin has
decided to give up coaching tennis
and instead sponsor a W&L cheer
squad, which would also function as
a five credit P.E. course. Men are
encouraged to try out in the fall for
the squad, however Rankin said they
will be given no special treatment.
“They’ll have to shake their booties

just like everyone else,” she said.

As for the rest of the university,
a panel discussion on the MRS De-
gree will be held tonight from 8:00-
10:00 p.m. (out of consideration for
those who watch L.A. Law) in the
Arlington Women's Center for those
with questions, suggestions, or input.

Editors note: Hats off to Bambi, a
former W&L head cheerleader, who
just completed her last shock treat-
ment due to a scandalous affair
with Jim Bakker two years ago. We
love ya’ babe!

City approves Master Plan, Renaissance

By Brian Root
Editor

After several unanticipated delays,
the Lexington City Council last
Thursday approved Washington and
Lee's Master Plan, clearing the way
for the $12 million fraternity renova-
tion set to begin next month.

The city's Planning Commission,
which had been studying the plan for
weeks, unanimously recommended
that the plan be approved, said Coun-
cilman Sidney Brown.

Down to earth

“Obviously, we’re very pleased
that the city has approved the Master
Plan," said W&L Coordinator of
Capital Planning Frank Parsons.

Parsons said that, now that the
plan has been approved, renovation of
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house on
Washington Street will begin in about
two weeks.

“The place is already empty,”
said Parsons. “We were just waiting
for final approval.”

Also, Parsons said, the renovation
of the fraternity houses in Red
Square will begin this summer, pend-

arrested in
Charlotte

By Cathy Lopiccolo
Assignment Editor

A former Washington and Lee
student has been arrested by the
Lexington Police Department and
charged with writing a $17,000 bad
check, according to Sergeant Torben
Pederson, the ofﬁcer in charge of the
arrest.

Pederson said police apprehended
William Gossman, a junior at Wash-
ington and Lee until his withdrawl
earlier this month, in Charlotte, NC
on April 18.

“He was apprehended in North
Carolina after being entered into the
NCIN, or National Crime Information
Network. He waived his extradition
rights and was brought back to Lexi-
ngton,” Pederson szid.

Pederson said Gossman had pur-
chased a car at Lexington Motor
Sales April 3, the same day he with-
drew from school, according to Reg-
istrar Scott Dittman. The police be-
came involved in the case April 11.

“Between those times there had
been negotiations between the dealer-
ship and he and his parents in North
Carolina. He said he would make the
checks good and never did, so a
warrant was issued for his arrest.
Since it was for a check for over
$200, it is a felony offense, and we
get involved in all felonies,”
Pederson said.

Pederson said he hoped Goss-
man’s preliminary hearing would be
held in early May. If convicted,
Gossman will be charged with a
larcenous offense, which carries a
maximum sentence of ten years in
prison. However, Pederson said he
thinks Gossman will receive only
probationary time, because his crime
was non-violent and because he will
have reimbursed the dealership by the
time of the trial.

Pederson said he had also been
investigating a female who had been
traveling with Gossman.

ing approval of site plans by the city.

Parsons said that each fraternity
located in Lexington’s historic district
can only be renovated after the build-
ing plans are approved by the Lex-
ington Architectural Review Board.

The renovations of the Pi Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Nu, Phi Delta Theta,
Beta Theta Pi, Phi Kappa Sigma and
SAE houses are scheduled to be com-
pleted by next January, according to
Parsons.

The entire fraternity renovation,
Parsons said, should take 18 months
to two years.

“The actual plan is supposed to
take a year and a half,” said Parsons.
“But we're assuming we'll run into
some small delays either with the city
or the builders.”

Parsons said he originally ex-
pected the plan to gain approval by
the first week in April, but that the
city raised unanticipated objections to
some of the plan’s proposals.

“We originally wanted to close
off the one block of Henry Street that
runs through Red Square into a one-
way street," said Parsons. “Unfortu-
nately, some members of council

campus, and a bronze replica will replace it high atop the Colonnade.
The process of restring the statue and making the replica Is expected

Council Thursday of a zoning amen-

Lee’s revised Master Plan will per-
mit construction, beginning in the
winter of 1992, of four sorority hou-
ses.

According to Laurel Ann Heis-
kell, the Panhellenic Housing Chair-
man, the University’s blueprints show
houses for Chi Omega, Kappa Kappa
Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta in
the Davidson Park area, and a Delta
Gamma house where Kappa Sigma
now stands.

Following the move by Kappa
Sigma into the renovated Zeta Beta
Tau house, the Kappa Sigma house
will be razed to make way for a new
building to house the yet-to-be-colo-
nized Delta Gamma Sorority. q j

V The exact date for ‘beginning
construction is dependent on the
completion of the fraternity house
renovations, all a part of the Frater-
nity Renaissance Plan included in the
new Master Plan.

The proposed sorority houses will
be similar in structure to the existing
fraternity houses but will differ on

havior for fraternities.

“I hope this wouldn’t allow the
school to decide it no longer wants to
regulate the fraterni“-es at some later
date,” said Moore.

“If W&L tells us that they're no
longer in the behavioral modiﬁcation
business," said City Manager Joe
King, ‘‘we’ll tell them we’re no
longer in the business of allowing
fraternities.’ ’

Heiskell said each house will
probably be two-stories high with a
full basement, living room, dining
room, and perhaps a number of bed-
rooms depending on the opinions of
the individual sororities. Industrial
kitchens would be necessary to serve
an entire chapter, as well. The cost
of living in these houses would be
comparable to present campus hous-
ing, said Heiskell.

Results of a survey conducted by
the Housing Comittee and distributed
to all sorority members are currently
being processed. The survey asked
sorority members to respond accord-
ing to what they believe women who
have not been exposed to W&L as an
“unhoused campus” would want. The
questions targeted areas such as types
of rooms necessary, the number of
bedrooms, types of meal plans, and
the necessity of a house mother.

pplahuds SAB, FD budget figures

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

The Executive Committee applauded Student
Activities Board officers Monday night after the
SAB presented its winter term budget report
and an outline of planned spring concerts.

The SAB entertainment budget ended winter
term over $8,500 in the black. That money will
be added to the $7,0()0 spring term allotment.

As of this spring, the SAB will have spon-
sored more activities than it did last year, but
it will be in better ﬁnancial shape, according to
SAB Chairman Charles Conklin and SAB
Entertainment Director Michael Applebaurn.
Last year’s SAB ended the year more than
$20,000 in debt.

SAB ofﬁcers announced the following
concerts for spring term: New Potato Caboose
was at General Headquarters last night; a free
concert by Tunji at the Law School on April
27; a free Mother’s Day concert by The Truly

Masseuse must go
back to school

Dangerous Swamp Band on the Colonnade Sat-
urday afternoon of Alumni Weekend, May 13;
Dash Rip Rock performing at GHQ on May 16
at 8:30 p.m.; and Valence at GHQ on May 18,
also "at 8:30 p.rn.

The SAB plans to co-sponsor a concert on
May 25 with the lnterfratemity Council for
Springfest, said Conklin, and if money remains
after all these concerts, they may plan more ac-
tivities.

The SAB’s winter term success comes in
the wake of a similarly successful Fancy Dress
budget hearing last month.

FD Chairman Alexander Hitz reported to the
EC on March 26 a surplus of $12,663 with
about $11,000 in outstanding bills yet to be
paid, indicating that FD roughly paid for itself
this year. Duwel told The Ring—tum Phi last
September that “FD is in theory supposed to
pay for itself  [but] it never has [before].”

Hitz estimated that almost 1,100 couples
attended the ball this year, exclusive of SAB
members and faculty. Thatrﬁgure fell somewhat

short of expectations, possibly because the Law
School was on break, but EC President Willard
Dumas called the attendance “very close to the
number projected.”
Dumas commended Hitz and the FD com-
mittee members on their dedication and success.
Conklin and Hitz warned that the financial
ﬁgures released at that EC meeting are not
ﬁnal, and will not be deﬁnite until the accoﬁt
is closed. However, Hitz said he was “really
pleased with how everything came out.”

The EC appointed Claude Worrell Chairman
of the White Book Revisions Committee and
named eight other students to the committee.
They are: Keith Duet, Hill Goodspeed, Mat-
thew Malloy, Duncan Miller, Jennifer Spreng,
Bradley Turner, Joshua van Hulst and Robert
Wilson.

According to Spreng, the committee met
once to break into smaller, working groups, and
planned to meet again today as a whole.

The EC also heard a budget request from
Trident on March 26. They requested $6,400 to

cover part of the projected $9,500 expense for
Confetti’s weekend on May 25-26. Rather than
allotting a budget, the EC told Trident represen-
tatives that the EC would cover expenses up to
$4,470. Trident hopes to raise an additional
$2,700 on their own.

The Minority Student Association presented
a budget report showing a balance of just under
$1,300. They projected a final balance of zero
at year’s end. Highest among MSA’s expenses
were a Martin Luther King recognition recep-
tion for $600, and $479 for T-shirts to be sold
at Springfest.

MSA President James Rambeau said the
MSA had not decided on a design for the
T-shirts. Sophomore EC Rep. Caroline Wight
recommended that Rambeau investigate cospon-
sorship of the T-shirts with other Spring-
fest-sponsoring organizations and that the design
be commemorative of the event.

The Volleyball Club reported a total spend-
ing Of $762.60, $12.60 over their allotment. The
money primarily paid tournament fees and dues.

Masseuse Lindy Felix is going to
have to wait until she graduates from
a certiﬁed massage program before
she can get her hands on Lexington.

Lexington City Council amended
an ordinance last week allowing
certified masseurs to escape the $1-
500 “nuisance fee” required of thera-
pists who want to do business in
town.

According to an article in The
Ring-tum Phi Jan. 25, Felix was
enrolled in a state—certiﬁed program.
She is working at the Staunton Ath-
letic Club and in private homes
around Lexington, the Phi reported.

As passed, the ordinance with
amendment exempts therapists who
work under the supervision of doctors
and other health practitioners, athletic
trainers and, now, certiﬁed masseurs.

According to councilwoman Lou-
ise Moore, Felix does not have a
shop in Lexington because she is not

certified by the American Massage
Therapist Association or the state
board of education.

In January, Felix appealed to the
Social and Economic Services Com-
mittee of the city council to have the
$1500 fee changed to a revenue-based
tax. Tliursday’s passage is the end-
result of her appearance.

The Ring-tum Phi was unable to
contact Felix by press time.

Lexington’s only massage thera-
pist, Elizabeth Gammon, says the
amended ordinance won’t affect her.
Right now, she is working under the
supervision of Chiropractor Linda
Larsen, and thus exempted from the
tax. Gammon, who graduated from a
certiﬁed massage school, has been
working for Larsen for about a year
and a half, said Larsen.

According to popular wisdom,
massage therapists are merely a eu-
phemism for an older, less reputable
profession. The purpose of the “nui-
sance tax” is to prevent prostitution
from coming to Lexington under the
guise of massage therapy.

 OPINION

it’s that time of
year again

Welcome back. Welcome to spring term. Welcome to
a six-week period unlike anything at any other college
or university (that we know of). If you managed to
manipulate your schedule properly, you will be through
with classes for the week by the time you read this.
Needless‘ to say, that presents some unique social
opportunities.

As you already know, spring term is, in essence, a
good time. Some of the best parties of the year will be
thrown in the next month or so. That, combined with
the fact that most of us are taking only two classes,
means we can all have a blast at a relatively small
amount of risk to our GPA’s.

However, it also means something else. With more
spare time and more parties come increased risk to
everyone. To recommend that drinking be curtailed
would be pointless as well as impractical. Besides, only
those without sin should cast the first stone.

What we do recommend, however, is that when you
do go to parties, or to Goshen, or wherever, please
drink responsibly. Make sure there's someone sober to
drive you home, be it a friend or Live Drive, or even
someone you met in Lloyd’s 20 minutes ago.

If the holier-than-thou approach isn’t working, let’s
try a new argument.

The Lexington police, the state police, and the
Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board also know
that it’s spring term, and you better believe they’ll be
out to get you when you screw up. Nothing would
make us happier than to have a nice, peaceful term
without having to print any stories about students
getting busted, especially since the EC doesn’t like it
when we do that.

It’s not just for
liberals anymore

I c 0 ‘
On occasion, issues appear that command the attention

and passion of everyone, whether conservative or liberal.
The conservation of the environment should be one of
them, like it or not.

In the last 19 years that Earth Day has existed, it was
just one of those innocuous little holidays that no one
noticed. Arbor Day, anyone? Suddenly, almost out of

nowhere, it 2 was: "EARTH :f.DAY',' A and P" an‘yo'ne”who ‘(was I“

environmentally conscious was all over the news decrying
the plight of our planet. Now, almost as suddenly, it’s
over, at least nationally.

That seems to be the trend these days with big issues.
An issue will come along to inﬂame the passion in us all
and then disappear.

If you really want to accomplish something for the
betterment of our world, every day should be Earth Day,
not just when CBS tells you it is.

Saving the environment is the most bipartisan of issues,
and one which must command our everyday attention.

Our congratulations go to the Outing Club for the
schedule of events for this week, and we hope you attend
some, if not all, of them.

Their message is an important one, perhaps the most
important of our generation. We would all do well to
listen more than just once a year.

To our readers

This week, the new editors of The Ring—tum Phi,
Patricia Lopes and Brian Root, have nobly attempted to
take over (with lots of help from their friends). Please
bear with us as we try to make the transition. Our
thanks go Genienne Mongno, James B. Lake, Greg

‘Democratic’

MY VIEW
-.By;rAla-n;:Heinrich—::.‘rr.it ~

The recent democratic revolutions in Eastern
Europe provide western audiences not only with a
reprieve from the same old wom-out headlines, but
also with an opportunity to reﬂect upon the status
of some of the words invoked so often in our own
culture, in so far as they are understood by the
leaders of our government and of the mass media.
Needless to say, at the forefront of these words
would be “democracy.”

As a general rule, democracy is understood by
the aforementioned men and women in temrs of
the old show-biz formula, “Ya either got it or ya
don’t.” Throughout the ﬂurry of revolutionary
change in Europe, I do not recall a single reﬂec-
tion in the mainstream media or in the govem-
mental agencies upon which they rely for so much
of their information, among neither the pundits nor
the politicians, apropos the challenges and ambi-
guities of “democracy.” However, as is obvious
from the etymology of the word — from two Greek
roots, “demos" and “kratos,” meaning “people"
and “power,” as we all recall from junior high -
— as well as from the spirit of the Declaration of
Independence and from other essential documents
upon which our nation was founded, “democracy”
in reality in no way signifies a static entity. There
are an infinite number of degrees in which democ-
racy — in contrast to oligarchy — may be realized.
That is to say, the degree to which a government
truly represents the interests of the population at
large, rather than a small, privileged elite, is the
measure of the integrity of a nation's democracy.

There is an exception to this general rule, to
this widespread belief in such a mystical and static
entity, Democracy: it is the equally widespread
term “ﬂedgling democracy." A favorite expression
of the Somoza clan (I believe the elder Anastasio
coined it; at any rate, it had a special place in his

We would like to make a few remarks con-
cerning the open hearing held last Tuesday that
resulted in the expulsion of one of our brothers,
Jeffery Trussell. Although we are in a state of
disbelief about the outcome of the trial, we
realize that the Honor System is not to be
blamed for the events that led up to the hearing.
Furthermore, we do not feel that he was denied
a fair trial in any way, or that the actions of the
jurors or advocates were prompted by any mo-
tives save for their duties to the Honor System.

In an imperfect world, we realize that not
even the most time-honored traditions can live up
to our expectations. Our first reaction is to reject
the Honor System for the suffering it has caused
Jeff and his family. Yet, we realize Jeff knew the
Honor System carried certain responsibilities, and
the severe punishment for any violation of that
system.

Although many aspects of the case were hazy
and inconsistent, one thing remained true
throughout the proceeding: that Jeff never for an

frequently employed by the likes of JFK, Zbigriiew

Reagan, Dan Quayle and myriad political commen-
tators to refer to Central American governments
that practice terrorism on an administrative level.
While the ordinary campesino is often a target of
these U.S.-founded, trained and funded armies, the
most regular customers are the priests and labor
activists who are trying to organize the peasants
into a politically cohesive force. In other words,
the death squads essentially target the political
opposition while making their frequent murderous
rounds.

A country that routinely be-
holds the murder of its op-
position Ieaders  is a far
cry from being democratic.

Now, it should be obvious that a prerequisite to
a healthy representative democracy is an open
forum for debate and the existence of an opposition
party to provide the people with , electoral choice.
Clearly, a country that routinely beholds the
murder of its opposition leaders (regardless of
whether the civilian leadership —- for example,
Christiani or Cerezo — is corrupt (as the evidence,
such as the absence of any successful prosecution
of the perpetrators of these anti-democratic acts
suggests), or simply irripotent and serving as the
figureheads of military states for the betterment of
their nation's international image) is a far cry from
being democratic, ﬂedgling or otherwise. Add to
this the fact that voting is mandatory in El Salva-
dor and Guatemala, as well as the fact that voting
boxes are transparent and curious army personnel
are omnipresent — i.e., in these countries, plagued
by state terror, there are no secret ballots — and
you have very peculiar democracies indeed.

We believe he was the victim of a vicious set

attempts to attach to him.

It is because of this great respect for Jeff that
we look with dismay on the outcome of the trial.

its potential, now that he must leave college and
face the real world alone. However, in our

Upon reﬂection, this usage is not an exception,"
to the “general rule” discussed above; both the
general usage of the -word democracy as well as
the term ﬂedgling democracy together indicate any
obliviousness to the very spirit of democracy itself
on the part of politicians and mediagogues. That is,’
the challenges implied by a form of government
that ideally is a government “of the people, fort
the people, and by the people” are ignored.

This ignorance has far-reaching consequences.‘
The institution that defines, and thereby in essence‘
creates, public opinion, along with the individuals
and bureaucratic structures that pander to this)
public opinion, together profess the heresy that we ,
needn't be vigilant in defence of true democratic ‘
representation; again, because you either got it on
you don’t. On the contrary, it seems all the more
necessary on this account to raise the empirical"
question regarding the degree of democracy in our ,
nation. For example, what is the status of the
political opposition here? Do citizens really have ai
meaningful choice given our two-party system? As t-_
the miserable voter tumouts indicate, many citizens I
seem to think that they do not. But the basic point It
here is that this empirical question is an important
one, yet is one that is obscured by powerful *
institutions of American society. ,

I am afraid, however, that it is not simply
ignorance that obscures the importance of thisi
question. I believe that there are many here who
are downright disdainful of democracy. In a con-5
versation I had with an employee of the Heritage
Foundation, one of the most powerful and most
heavily funded of all the so—called “think—tanks,” .
I commented on the irrirnorality of U.S. Central
American policy, to which he responded, “All that ~
matters is what is in the interests of the U.S.” I
then asked him how such interests could be ca1cu—

The Second Armual Kappa Alpha
Theta Triathlon is scheduled for this
Sunday at 9 a.m. in front of Dorernus
Gymnasium.

According to Heather Logan, who
has organized the event for the past
two years, participants will first run
3.1 miles on a course around campus,
then bike 13 miles, and finally swim
36 lengths in the gymnasium pool.

Racers may participate as individuals
or in relay teams, and Logan said co-
ed relays are encouraged

Medals will be awarded to the top
three relays, the top three men and
the top three women. In addition,
every participant is given a T-shirt.

Race sponsors include Theta and
ﬁve local businesses — Fantasies,
Travel Unlimited, Pappagallo, Marie's
Hair Stylers and Alvin-Demiis.

Flush contact
may be curtailed

By Jason Kelley

Fratemity and sorority winter term
grades were released, and possible
curtailing of open contact during next
fall’s rush was discussed at Tuesday
riight’s lnterfraternity Council meet-
ing.

All three sororities came out
ahead of the fraternities, with Chi
Omega leading the pack. Kappa Sig-
ma led the fraternities, followed by Pi
Kappa Alpha and Lamda Chi Alpha.

Chi-O had a 3.105 GPA for the
winter term, followed by Kappa Kap-
pa Gamma with a 3.051 and Kappa
Alpha Theta with a 2.954

Kappa Sigma’s winter term GPA
was 2.916, moving them up to first
place from their second place fall
berth. Sigma Chi, which had the
highest fall term grades, fell to fifth
place in the winter rankings.

In his first meeting as IFC Presi-
dent, Goodloe Lewis said that the
Student Affairs Committee, which
makes final approval of the IFC’s
rush calendar, is considering scratch-
ing at least one day of open contact
between freshman and fraternity
members next fall.

According to Lewis, the commit-

project. Our sorority chooses a na-
tional philanthropy project each year
and every Theta chapter works for
that project,” Logan said.

According to Logan, CASA was
started by a judge to help abused
children in the court system.

“CASA is a mediator between the
child’s parents and the social worker.
The child is torn between these two
people. The advocate spends time
with the child to represent him and
give the judge a more objective view
of the child’s life than the parents or

social worker can," Logan said.

Logan said about 40 people par-
ticipated in the triathlon last year.
She said she expects about the same
turnout this year.

“We were pretty well supported
last year. From the entries so far this
year, we have people from VMI, the
law school and W&L," Logan said.

“The past two years the race has
been in late May, but we moved it
this year so people from the law
school and VMI could be involv .”

Logan said the triathlon was

started several years ago by the
ROTC department. Three years ago
two students from the Executive
Committee sponsored it with Student
Activities Board funds. When there
were no sponsors for the event last
year, Logan suggested that her chap-
ter organize the event.

“It was our pledge project, and
we decided to make it an annual
race. The athletic department was
excited about the idea and wanted it
to be annual too,”Logan said.

“My sorority wanted to do some-

thing to be involved in a positive
way on campus. We can do a lot of
philanthropy off campus, but we
wanted to be involved here, too. We
want to give back to the school some
of what it does for us. We can be
active at W&L and help other people
at the same time.”

Logan said it is not too late to
join the Kappa Alpha Theta Triathlon.
Participants can register in front of
the gym from 7:45 - 8:45 a.m. Sun-
day before the race. The registration
fee is $15.

During W&L’s first sorority rush,
in January, actives and pledges were
unable to participate in any collegiate
social activities until bids had been
distributed to the nishees the follow-

rounded by controversy in January.

As well as planning for its own

helping others by organizing and
participating in various community

D-Hall gets

liquor license

By Cathy Loplccolo
Assignment Editor

Staff Reporter

Chemistry Professor Dr. J. Keith Shillington was

Evans Dining Hall has been granted a new liquor

scheduled to undergo minor surgery today at the Uni-
versity of Virginia Hospital, according to Chemistry
Professor Dr. William Watt.

Although Watt said he was uncertain about the exact
nature of the surgery, he said it is related to Shillington’s
“general physical condition," not to the rrrild stroke he
suffered earlier this year. Watt said Shillington had been
recuperating from the stroke at the Rehabilitation Center
in Waynesboro when he developed a condition which
necessitated his move to the Charlottesville hospital.

According to an article in the Feb. 15 issue of The
Ring-tum Phi, Shillington suffered a mild stroke Jan. 10
and spent ten days in Stonewall Jackson Hospital. He
then underwent therapy at Stonewall Jackson Extended
Care Facility to regain use of the left side of his body
before being moved to Waynesboro.

Watt said it is too soon to predict whether Shillington
will be back in the classroom next year.

“He was hoping to teach next year, but we'll have to
see what his health is like,” Watt said.

license which will allow for a more extensive catering
service, according to Gerald Darrell, Director of the
University Food Service.

According to Darrell, the Dining Hall’s new Annual
Catering License allows them to serve beer, wine and
hard liquor at Dining Hall-catered events at the Dining
Hall and in the Lexington Community.

Darrell said that in the past, the Dining Hall received
24-hour Mixed Beverage Permits in order to serve
alcohol.

However, the extensive use of their catering service
has made the armual license more feasible. Darrell
explained that one 24-hour Mixed Beverage Permit costs
$35, while the annual license costs $1,300.

Evans Dining Hall does not serve alcohol at functions
they cater for student organizations. Darrell said that this
policy will not change because of the new license.

If any person younger than 21 is caught by an ABC
agent drinking alcohol at a Dining Hall event, the Dining
Hall would lose its liquor license, said Darrell.

to jump
for heart

 

By Kelly McCabe
Staff Reporter

The many activities plarmed for
National Health Education Week will
help make everyone “aware of the
effects of diet and exercise on the
heart," said Associate Dean of Stu-
dents Anne Schroer-Lamont, who co-
ordinated the activity committee.

Friday’s Jump Rope for Heart is
one of the week's highlights, said
Schroer-Lamont. Fraternities and
sororities, as well as other groups
including the biology department,
have entered teams in the event,
which is a fund raiser for the Ameri-
can Heart Association.

In the past two years, Washing-
ton and Lee has raised more money
than any other university in Virginia,
and Schroer-Lamont said she hopes
this year’s event will raise $2,000,
which would top last year’s total by

200

%

Jump Rope for Heart, co-spon-
sored by the Intramural Club, will be
held at the Doremus Gymnasium
parking lot, and begins at 12:30 p.m.

Blood cholesterol and blood pres-
sure tests will be administered in the
side dining room of Evans Dining
Hall on Friday morning from 8:30
until 10:00, followed by a healthy
breakfast, Schroer-Lamont said.

The cholesterol test is free to the
first 50 participants, and there will be
a minimal charge for others. There is
no charge for the blood pressure test.

Schroer-Lamont said anyone par-
ticipating in the cholesterol test
should not eat breakfast before the
test, because this will make the re-
sults less accurate.

Participants will be notified of
their test results by the health center
in the following weeks, she said.

Evans Dining Hall is also offering
special “healthy heart" menu items
this week. Literature on cholesterol
awareness, vitamin facts, and eating
disorders is also available in the

lobby.

Peter M. Gresshoff, Racheff Chair of Excellence
in Plant Molecular Genetic at the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville, will speak at W&L May 3,
at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

The topic of Gresshoffs lecture is “Research
Advances and Applications of DNA Diagnosis in
Plants.” He will also lecture May 4 on “Molecular
Genetic Analysis of Nodulation in Soybean.”

The University of Termessee in Knoxville received
a major donation from Ivan Racheff to establish an
international research focus in an area of plant science.
This was coupled with the Termessee-wide Chairs of
Excellence program.

In January 1988, Gresshoff was appointed to the
program as professor of plant molecular genetics. Prior
to that, he taught at the Australian National University,
where he also received his doctorate degrees and
served as a research fellow.

Gresshoff’ s area of research is in the developmental
genetics of nodulation in legumes and he has published
widely on the subject.

The Racheff Chair is staffed with seven post-
doctoral/seriior faculty staff, several visiting professors,
and highly qualified technical, secretarial and
maintenance staff. The Chair teaches masters and
doctorate students and is involved in the teaching of
molecular genetics and developmental plant
biocherriistry/biology.

The lecture is sponsored by the Telford Lecture
Series at W&L.

Eleanor Holmes Norton, chairwoman of the
United States Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) from 1977 to 1981 and
professor of law at Georgetown University Law
Center, will deliver the annual Elizabeth Lewis Otey
Lecture at W&L Wednesday, May 2.

Norton will speak at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel. The
topic of her lecture will be civil rights and her
current work on affirmative action.

Hailed by rights activists and employers alike for
her unique ability to effect change, Norton is a
recognized authority on an impressive range of
domestic issues, including affirmative action,
comparable worth, family issues and race and sex
matters.

As the first woman to chair the EEOC and, prior
to that, the New York City Commission on Human
Rights, Norton has been highly regarded for her work
in developing equal employment law and policy, and
in using efficient systems that reformed EEOC
operations and reduced its large backlog of cases for
the first time in the Agency’s history.

As the EEOC chairwoman, Norton administered
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Equal Pay
Act, the Age Discrirriination in Employment Act and
Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act covering
handicapped iridividuais.

Norton was educated at Yale Law School, Yale
Graduate School (M.A., American Studies) and Antioch
College. She has co-authored a book, Sex

WHO’S ON THE HILL

  

Discrimination and the Law: Causes and Remedies,
and is currently writing a book about the development
and impact of anti-discrirriination law and affirmative
action remedies in an effort to help clarify public
understanding.

She has received many honors, including 28
honorary degrees, and serves on a variety of boards,
among them the Rockefeller Foundation, the Yale
Corporation, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for
Social Change and the Pitriey Bowes corporation.

The Otey Lecture Series at W&L is named for
Elizabeth Lewis Otey, a pioneer in the women's rights
movement from Lynchburg, Va. Otey, who died in
1974 at the age of 93, was among the first Suffragettes
who marched on the White House in the early part of
this century in support of the women's rights
movement.

The Otey Lecture Series was established at
Washington and Lee in 1987 by E. Otey Watson of
Lynchburg, Otey’s daughter. The series is dedicated to
bringing recognized women of achievement to the
W&L campus. The first three Otey lecttirers were
Colorado Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder, NPR
journalist Susan Stamburg, and Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.

Sculpture and drawings by Larry M. Stene,
associate professor of art at W&L will be on exhibit
in duPont Gallery April 23 to May 18.

An opening reception and slide/lecture by Stene
will be held in duPont Hall tonight at 7 p.m.

The exhibit will consist of several wall-oriented
relief sculptures of sculptural reliefs that have texture
and pattern as the emphasis. The textures and patterns
are created with mixed media and found objects. The
exhibit also includes a selection of drawings in ink,
graphite, and pastel with landscapes as a theme.

This is Stene's second one-person exhibit at W&L
and features works produced over the last two years.
His last one-person show at W&L was in 1983.

Stene joined the W&L faculty in 1982. He holds a
B.S. degree in art from Moorhead State University and
an M.F.A. in art from the University of Illinois.

duPont Gallery hours are Monday through Friday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The University-Rockbridge Symphony Orchestra
will appear in Lee Chapel on Saturday, April 28
1990.

Their program is destined to include those golden
olden hits of the nineteenth century.

The program is called “The Symphony plays the
Hits*” (*the hits of the nineteenth century, that is.)

Sponsored by Washington and Lee and the Fine
Arts in Rockbridge program, this is the first time this
program will appear in Lexington before it plays again.
The orchestra may or may not go on tour in the near
future. The orchestra has appeared in the past.

Jan Hathom looks absolutely
nothing like Herb Brooks. But they
do have some similarities.

Back in 1980, Brooks coached the
United States Olympic hockey team
to art improbable gold metal. Im-
probable because no one expected
them to do as well as they did.

This season, Hathom has taken
the Washington and Lee women's
lacrosse program to a level few
people expected them to reach in just
two years.

Said Hathom, “We are a hard
working team. Everyone has worked
together to get us where we are.
We've had some great performances
by different players, but it’s not fair
for me to single people out. We are
a team without a star. We're success-
ful because we put things together as
a unit.”

The unit complied a 9-6 regular
season record, going 5-2 in Old
Dominion Athletic Conference games,
good for second place in the stand-
ings and the second seed in the con-
ference tournament.

“We're peaking at the right
time,” said Hathom before the game.
“We played some tough games early
on in the season, and we got in
shape to play at the end of the year.
We scored 60 goals in our last ﬁve
[regular season] games. I think that
shows we’re peaking now.”

Wednesday,, Hathom and the
peaking Generals played host to
Sweet Briar in the opening round.
Said Hathom before the game, “Last
season we went into the tournament

vSPORTS
Generals streak into tourn

and surprised some people. This year
people will be after us, and I am
expecting a very tough game from
Sweet Briar."

The Generals, a quick starting
team of late, wasted no time in tak-
ing the lead. Junior Shawn Wert
supplied the early scoring as the
Generals jumped out to a 4-0 lead.
The defense was doing the job also,
as sophomore goalie Erica Ingersoll
saw only two shots in the first half.
W&L led at the midway point 7-1.

Said Hathom, “The girls met last
night and decided they wanted to
score as many in the second half as
they did in the first. Lately, we have
been playing strong ﬁrst halves and
weak second halves. Today we played
a full game.”

W&L put up six goals in the
second half and sophomore Jennifer
Donaldson took over in goal and
made five saves. Senior Jennie Brent
scored a goal in what could be her
last home game. Wert and sophomore
Kimberly Bishop scored four goals
each. Freshman Lisa Dowling had
two while junior Melinda Conkling
and freshman Jennifer Singleton also
scored. _

The Generals closed the regular
season in impressive fashion, winning
four straight games to extend their
winning streak to ﬁve, four in the
ODAC.”Two of the conference wins
came on the road over Hollins (7-5)
and Randolph-Macon (10-5). W&L
defeated Sweet Briar (12-4) and Gou-
cher (13-5) at home.

To start the four-game stretch,
Wert scored four goals in the con-
quest of Sweet Briar, avenging last
year's 10-9 loss. Wert contributed
four other goals against Hollins, R-

to an end yesterday afternoon
with a 3-2 loss to top-seeded
Hampden-Sydney in the first
round of the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference tournament. The
Generals ﬁnished with a record of
5-15, 3-12 in the ODAC.

Senior Jolm Morris continued
to hold the top spot in the na-

as he helped W&L to a 2-3 week
in Florida. The Generals lost to
Division I Central Florida (7-2),
top ten Division H Rollins (7-2)

Thursday brings a meet at Bridge-
water for the Generals, and Leslie
said the team will use the meet for
two purposes. “The meet gives us
another chance to play everyone else
in the ODAC, plus Bridgewater is the
host school for the ODAC Champion-
ships next week. Also, we’ll get a
free round of practice on the cham-
pionship course. That should help.”

The Generals, 344, have defeated
every team in the ODAC at least
once this season, and Leslie is taking
the realist's approach to the tourna-
ment. “We've been a fortunate team
this year in that when one player has
an off round, there has been someone
else there to pick him up. That has
been a big key for us.

“In the ODAC, Lynchburg, Roa-
noke and Bridgewater all have better
than average shots at the title, but so
do we. We can win it or we can lose
it. Whoever has the hot hand on
those two days will come away with
the title,” said Leslie.

Ingersoll also had a big week for
the Generals. In the win against R-
MC to close the regular season, In-
gersoll made 19 saves. Conkling also
came up big against the Yellow Jack-
ets, scoring two goals and handing
out an assist as W&L jumped out to
a 9-1 halftime lead en route to the
10-5 win.

Bishop now has 41 for the season.
Wert has 26 and Dowling has 21.
Said Hathom, “Early in the season,
Kimberly set the pace for us the way
she scored, but now everyone is
starting to catch up with her. We had
games where six or more people have
scored.

“I'm pleased with the way every-

Hathom. “Over the past week, Me-

Dallum and [freshman] Lisa Jennings

The Generals, 10-6 on the season,
will meet Lynchburg Friday in the
semiﬁnals. W&L defeated LC 6-3
earlier in the season.

“We all thought we deserved to
be in the ﬁnal four, and now we’re
there,” said Hathom. “We feel all
the pressure is on Lynchburg because
they weren’t supposed to lose to us
the first time. They have to redeem
themselves. It should be a tough
game, but we'll be ready.”

Optimism high despite loss

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

The last time the Washington and
Lee men’s lacrosse team finished the
season with a winning record was
1987, when the»Generals ﬁnished 11-
4. That team reached the NCAA
Division III Final Four.

The 1990 version of the Generals
will no doubt finish the season with
a winning record, but that may not be
good enough to qualify for the
NCAA Tournament.

But fust year head coach Jim
Stagnitta thinks otherwise despite a

 

Jlm Stagnitta

...7-4 in first year

12-4 loss to second-ranked Washing-
ton College. “If we can win our last
two games and ﬁnish 9-4, we should
be in the Top 10, and that will merit
serious consideration for a bid. We
have two big wins over highly ranked
teams, and there are teams in the Top
10 now who have no big wins. That
will deﬁnitely work in our favor.”

Going into Saturday's game, the
Generals were ranked No. 11 in the
nation and riding a four-game winn-
ing streak, including two wins in
overtime over teams ranked at the
time.

Washington College wasted little
time in showing that it deserved its
No. 2 ranking. Said Stagnitta, “We
didn't play a real strong ﬁrst quarter,
and that coupled with the fact that
they are bigger, stronger and faster

really did us in. On the whole, our
defense played well, but when you
have three of your top players not
play their best game, you won't beat
the No. 2 team in the nation.”

Junior Tom Costello came up big
time and time again in goal for
W&L, but the Generals could not
muster a rally against WC. Costello
made a career high 24 saves but may
not have been the best goalie on the
ﬁeld. Said Stagnitta, “When we were
able to get shots, their goalie [Dave
Slomkowski} just plain stuffed us. He
may be the best goalie in the
nation."

Senior attackrnan Chris Mastro-
giovanni was held to one goal. The
loss was W&L’s ﬁrst at home this
season. The Generals are now 4-1 on
Wilson Field.

During the streak, Mastrogiovanni
put up some impressive numbers.
Said Stagnitta, “As Mastro goes, so
goes the team. When he is scoring it
means two things — our transition is
working and he is finishing the play
and that our midﬁeld is playing well
and getting him the ball.”

Against Gettysburg on March 24
in the rain and snow on Wilson
Field, he scored ﬁve goals, including
his team's last three. The ﬁfth was
the garne-wirmer in the second over-
time off a feed from junior midﬁelder

Todd Garliss.

Garliss also had two goals and
two assists as the Generals topped
then sixth-rariked Gettysburg 8-7.

“The Gettysburg game really
turned our season around,” said
Stagnitta. “We were coming off two
tough losses, and to beat a team as
good as Gettysburg after falling be-
hind is a credit to us. They tied the
game with three seconds left, and that
gave them momentum, but we hung
tough and Mastro pulled it out.”

On March 28, also at home, the
Generals held off Middlebury College
as Mastrogiovanni led the way with
ﬁve goals and one assist. Said Stag-
nitta, “We were pretty banged up,
but we were able to hold them off
late and win the game."

On March 31 the Generals played
their ﬁnal road game on the year at
Guilford in another Top 20 clash.
Guilford was ranked twelfth coming
into the game.

“We fell behind late in the
game,” said Stagnitta. “We chipped
away, and for the ﬁrst time, they
guys got the feeling that they would
come back and win. It was the first
time in a while that the guys played
conﬁdent from behind.”

Trailing 12-11, Mastrogiovanni fed
sophomore Jeff Roberts from behind
the goal for Roberts’ third goal of the
day with 58 seconds left to tie the
game at 12 and force an extra period.

Sophomore Wiemi Douoguih beat
his man out front and then beat the
goalie from ﬁfteen yards out just 22
seconds in giving W&L a 13-12 win.

The fourth came when the Gen-
erals entertained Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference foe Virginia Wes-
leyan. The Generals raced out to a
19-0 goal before Virginia Wesleyan
got on the board.

Mastrogiovanni scored the ﬁrst
four goals of the game in a span of
4:07 in the opening quarter. He ﬁn-
ished with six goals on the day.
Freshman Rhett Hancock scored ﬁve
second half goals, and ﬁve other
Generals scored two or more goals in
the 25-1 win.

The Generals, 7-4, 2-2 in ODAC
play, will ﬁnish out the season with
two home games, Sunday against
Hampden-Sydney and on May 5 with
the Lee-Jackson Classic against VMI.

Track looking
to regain title

By John Neumann
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee men’s
track team finished tuning up for this
weekend's Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championships by compet-
ing at the Catholic Invitational last
weekend in the Washington D.C.
rain.

Head coach Norris Aldridge was
pleased with his team's performance
considering the inclement weather.
“We ran pretty well considering the
weather,“ said Aldridge.

Winning performances included
the 4x100 meter relay team of seniors
Wes Boyd, Tie Sosnowski, Scott
Williams, and junior Carl Gilbert.
The only other winner was senior
Phillip Sampson who pole vaulted to
thirteen feet and six inches to claim
the crown.

Besides his strong contribution in
the 4x100 meter relay, Boyd grabbed
a third place in the 100 meters and a
fourth in the 200 meters. Williams
also contributed fourth place ﬁnishes

in the discus and the 400 meter run.

Aldridge feels the ODAC crown
is attainable but that everyone will
need to turn in fine performances and
is not looking for any one person or
group to lift the Generals.

Heading into this weekend, the
injuries are nearly all healed. Only
the Generals’ two top hurdlers remain
hurt. Freshman David Phillips may
try to overcome his hamstring prob-
lem and run the intermediate hurdles
this weekend. Sophomore David
Harper will deﬁnitely not run again
this season.

The Generals will try to add the
ODAC outdoor crown to the indoor
one they attained last winter. It would
be Aldridge's third crown in four
years. The meet begins at 10:00 am.
on Wilson Field.

Individually, despite of how he
ﬁnishes in the outdoor championships,
Gilbert has already earned a return
trip to the NCAA meet. The 1990
ODAC Indoor Track Athlete-of-the-
Year qualiﬁed for the triple jump in
outdoor competition as well.

The Fling-tum Phl, April 26, 1990

Medinica, a Birmingham, Alabama
sculptor, who will try to restore the
wooden statue, which has apparently
suffered from the elements, wood-
peckers, bugs, and a surplus of atten-
tion since it was placed on the cupola
of Washington Hall in 1844. Over the
years Old George, highly visible on

"The Hill," has been spiritedly deco- .

rated, painted, and unfortunately
abused on various occasions.

In the early 1900s a popular year-
ly event was the college boat races
on the old North River, for which all
of Lexington was decorated, including
Old George, who received daily coats
of paint for weeks. Virginia Military
Institute cadets have also gotten in on
the act, at times succeeding in paint-
ing him their school colors, red and
yellow. It is claimed that these hun-
dreds of coats of paint are responsi-
ble for Old George's preservation and
his 156 year—old reign over the cam-
pus.
On a sadder note, Old George has
also been tarred and feathered several
times.

Old George has also been used by
some to demonstrate particular opin-
ions. Soon- after co-education was
announced, George sported a banner
that said "No Marthas."

Recently the Cadaver Society, a
secret group of university benefactors,
gave George a society banner to
display. Someone also climbed atop
Washington Hall a few weeks ago
and left a VMI cap, a cape, and a
cardboard sign that read "Must Ev-
erything Change?"

The 8—foot statue weighing 700-
pounds, was originally carved as a
hobby by local carpenter Matthew
Kahle in 1840,‘ from a pine log he

found drifting down the James River.
It depicts George Washington stand-
ing in a toga, holding a sword and a
scroll, which symbolize his twin
callings as a scholar and a statesman.

Because it is painted a gleaming
white, the statue is frequently thought
to be made of marble. According to
legend the University paid Kahle
$100 for Old George and actually
planned to replace Old George with a
marble likeness in later years.

Shaw said that the estimated
$100,000 needed to restore Old
George would be contributed by
W&L’s Class of 1940, which
includes Sidney Lewis, for whom
Lewis Hall is named, and John Wam-
er, which the Warner Center is
named after.

The old Old George who has
looked serenely on the glories and
sorrows of Lexington and the Shenan-
doah Valley will be restored by
Medenica in his Alabama studio and
then sent to Florida, where he will be
used as a mold for a bronze replica,
which will be painted white and
placed atop Washington Hall. The
new and improved Old George will
receive a place of honor inside a
school building. Shaw cited the Len-
fest Center as a possible location.

The task to restore Old George
may take more than a year, according
to Shaw, because "He had deterio-
rated more than anyone had realized."

Shaw said that Medenica was
also surprised at the condition of Old
George. Several weeks ago when
Medenica went up on the Washington
Hall roof to look at the statue, he
noticed it swayed dangerously on its
perch when touched. He also thought
it had hollow spots inside.

m, Ala, inspects the

damage to Old George, the wooden statue of George Washington that
was removed from the main building on campus. W&L photo by W.

Patrick Hinely.

The statue went to pieces when it
was removed, losing its base, its,
feet, and half of its right leg.

Despite his present condition, Old
George has been a trooper throughout
his years of watch over the communi-
ty. He has only been restored two
other times, once in 1936, when he
was removed, and in the 1960s when
he was repaired on the rooftop.

In 1864, during the Civil War, he
is said to have saved the university,
then named Washington College,
from destruction by Union forces.
Union Colonel David Hunter had just
finished shelling VMI, which was
almost completely destroyed, and was
turning his guns toward Washington

College when Captain Henry A.
DuPont told him about Old George.
Hunter refrained from attacking the
likeness of George Washington and
moved on down the valley.

One question remains un-
answered. Until our sacred Old
George is replaced, who will keep
vigil over Lexington? Shaw said
"We'll just have to depend on the
statues of Cyrus McCormick and
Stonewall Jackson."

Executive Committee President
Willard Dumas expressed his hope
that "At least George will be up for
my graduation in 1991." As an after-
thought Dumas added "Knock on
wood." Pardon the pun George.

Lee Hi Truck Stop: a solid ‘A’

Where else can college students and truckers mingle?

By Todd Peppers
Entertainment Columnist

Warning: this review is not a
spin—off from the April Fool’s Day
edition of the Phi. Please do not
immediately dismiss it as utter gar-
bage, although by the end of the
article you can draw your own con-
clusions about my sanity. In this
review I will offer my opinions and
criticisms of a Lexington eating es-
tablishment: Lee Hi Truck Stop and
Restaurant.

A review of Lee Hi Truck Stop??
Eyebrows are immediately raised, and
alumni once again write nasty letters
concerning my writing. Why did I
select Lee Hi instead of the elegant
Wilson Walker House? Or the
charmingly rustic Maple Hall? Sim-
pie: during spring term students are
too busy sunbathirig, hiking, and
sleeping (oh yeah, they attend a few
classes) to eat regular meals. Wash-
ington and Lee students require a
place where good food, and an
unique atmosphere, are available
twenty-four hours a day. And Lee
Hi’s restaurant fits that order perfect-
ly.

If you love breakfast food at any
time of the day or night, and your
checking account is dying a fast
death, then Lee Hi is the perfect stop.
I ate at Lee Hi about six times dur-
ing winter semester, but never before
eleven o’clock at night. The circum-
stances are always the same: it’s late,
you’re tired of studying for a test,
(this term substitute sunbathing)
you’re hungry, and the idea of anoth-
er Domino’s pizza is unbearable. So
you call two of your friends, per-
suade them that a study break is in
order, and jump in the car. After a
two-mile drive up Highway 11 North,
you’ll begin to hear the rumble of
semis and smell the diesel fuel.
You’re at Lee Hi.

The breakfast menu is available
any time day or night, and it offers
good food at shockingly low prices.
But if you go to Lee Hi with a crav-
ing for breakfast food, then you must
order their hotcakes. (Don't ask for
pancakes, its a breach of etiquette
and four burly truckers will escort
you out of the restaurant) For only
a $1.75 one receives two gigantic
hotcakes and enough maple syrup to
drown any spring term blues. The
hotcakes are hot, ﬂuffy, and tasty.
Are you saying that hotcakes are not

enough? Then you can order two
hotcakes with sausage for only $2.60,
or two hotcakes with two eggs (any
style) for a mere $2.55. We’re talk-
ing pre—Carter Administration prices!

If you haven’t eaten in days, then
Lee Hi has a breakfast special that
will feed a family of six: “The He-
Man Special.” For $4.70 the follow-
ing mind-boggling combination ar-
rives at the table: two eggs, two
slices of bacon, a hamburger steak,
home fries, biscuits or toast, and
jelly. You can wash all that choles-
terol down with Lee Hi’s “bottomless
cup” of coffee for an extra 50 cents.

I am the hotcake fanatic, but one
of my suitemates also swears by Lee
Hi’s homemade sausage biscuits.
For $1.25 he gets one plain biscuit
with honey, butter and jelly, and one
sausage biscuit. I’ll have to admit
that the biscuits almost rival the
hotcakes. They are also served hot
and fresh. But these are only a few
of the low-priced breakfast entries
one can get. The list also includes
omelettes, hashbrowns, oatmeal,
corned beef hash, and, of course,
grits.. Reminds me of the spreads
Grandma use to put out on Sunday
morning.

I’ll admit that my attention has
not wavered past the breakfast menu,
but Lee Hi does offer a large selec-
tion of dishes with such names as
“Lean and Low” (for the trucker
who is watching his waistline) and
“The Fishennen's Net.” And for
those of you who not only miss
Grandma's breakfasts, but also her
dimers, Lee Hi serves up liver and
onions for a mere $4.05. I haven’t
been brave enough to order this par-
ticular dish.

The service is fast considering the
food was not prepared earlier in the
day, and I promise that your coffee
cup will not be empty for long. The
waitresses themselves are very effi-
cient and a bit grumpy, although in
all fairness who wants to wait tables
at midnight?

Also, if you're sick of the “Our
Gang” motif at a certain local restau-
rant, Lee Hi offers the other extreme:
fans hang from the ceilings, pictures
of fox hunting and Civil War gener-
als adorn the walls. In the back-
ground Hank Williams blares from
the mandatory jukebox. It made me
homesick for my homestate of Ne-
braska.

The tables are bright red formica
with hard woodchairs. and the ketch-

The Executive Comrnitte-elect
voted informally Wednesday night
against opening deliberations on com-
mittee appointments to the public.

EC Vice President-elect Raymond
Welder, presiding while EC President-
elect Thompson Hatcher is abroad,
voted in favor of the motion to open
deliberations.

Hatcher and Welder ran for ofﬁce
last term on platforms of more open-
ness in EC affairs.

Welder explained Wednesday
night that EC members should be
held accountable for their decisions,
since they are elected representatives.

The other EC members-elect voted
as follows on the motion to open
deliberations: Dumas, Fialcowitz,
Perkins, and Spurgeon all voted in
favor. Cobb, Kelsey, Kennington,
MacFarland, Wight, and Sophomore
Class President-elect Richard Burke,
sitting in for Ogden, all voted against
the motion.

Welder decided Tuesday night to
close the interviews for appointments,
despite a statement Monday night that
he would open them.

“I think [a Ring-tum Phi report-
er] should be here,” he said Monday,
noting that it might be helpful for
future applicants to refer to the Phi
in preparation foyr their interviews.

However, after Tuesday's inter-
views, Welder said that some can-
didates would not have been able to
be as open as they were with the EC
in their interviews had a reporter or
observers been present.

“Nobody elected the people who
wanted to be part of these commit-
tees to be in the hot seat,” said
Welder Tuesday. However, he said he
believes EC members are account-
able to students, and so deliberations
should be open.

Walter Scott, secretary of the
Constitutional Revisions Committee.
said the committee is now consider-
ing whether or not the EC should be
allowed to enter executive session for
proceedings other than honor-related

Atkins condemns
alcohol spending

By Jason Kelley
Senior Copy Editor

Saying, “It's time to grow up,
guys,” Associate Dean of Students
Leroy “Buddy” Atkins Tuesday
night decried the reported use of
fraternity house funds to purchase
alcohol.

“If you don't suck it up and tell
people that it’s BYOB, you’re going
to end up with paid security at the
door, and no one who is not of
drinking age will be admitted into the
house,” Atkins said at an Interfrater-
nity Council meeting.

Atkins said fraternities that buy
alcohol with house funds are putting

ordinance in any way.

 

Clarification

An article in last week’s issue of The Ring-tum

Lexington’s massage parlor ordinance. In that explana-
tion, the Phi did not intend to imply that the subject

suits.

“The minute you do that, you're
going naked — without any ir1sur-
ance whatsoever. If I see kegs at
your houses, I’ll call your national.
And if the national fraternity yanks
your charter, the university will end
it’s recognition of your house, and
then it’s bye-bye.”

IFC President Goodloe Lewis said
fraternities are in a bad position right
now because they want to continue
holding fall rush and need to behave
well to do so.

“The administration is watching
your every move, and if you screw
up, it may even affect your Renais-
sance standing,” said Lewis, referring

EC Vice-President—elect

The EC-elect received more than
80 applications for more than 20
positions.

No one applied for Financial
Relations Committee Chairman, SAB
Law School publicity director, or FD
vice chairman.

’ “The EC has the prerogative,”
said Welder, to keep a position open
until next fall if no one applies for it.

Welder also said that Hatcher
instructed that the EC-elect not ap-
point someone to a position for
which they did not apply.

In Monday night's regular EC
meeting, White Book Revisions Com-
mittee Chairman Claude Worrell told
the EC that the committee has split
into three groups to study the philo-
sophy, closed hearing, and open hear-
ing sections of the White Book.

Worrell said that the committee
will work through the summer hopes
to ﬁnish it’s work by December.

CRC revisions tabled

By James Lake
Staff Reporter

Proposed revisions to the policies
of the Conﬁdential Review Commit-
tee won’t be adopted until next fall
at the earliest, Washington and Lee
President John Wilson said Tuesday.

The suggested changes, which
would alter W&L's definitions of
harassment and modify the process of
appealing convictions, were approved
by the CRC in December and have
been in Wilson's hands since January.

But the president, who must ap-
prove the changes for them to take
effect, has yet to act on them and
says further study is needed, includ-
ing discussion of how the CRC’s
guidelines affect free speech rights.

“I don't want to go by a CRC
review without touching on [that]
larger question,” he said.

Wilson called the proposed

,k changes “technical" and said the
broader issues he wants considered
have not been a part of the recent
study of CRC policies.

Wilson said he wants under-
graduate and law faculty to discuss
how the CRC’s guidelines can be
written so that they forbid harass-
ment without discouraging other kinds
of speech. But he said he doesn't
think any formal discussion of that
question will take place until the fall.

The CRC, a committee of three
students and four faculty members
that investigates claims of sexual,
racial, ethnic or religious harassment
of students, met on Nov. 28 with

Dean of Students Lewis John. That
meeting led to the proposals that are
now before the president.

As The Ring-tum Phi reported on
Nov. 30, the proposed changes would
turn the focus of the CRC’s guide-
lines away from claims of faculty and
staff harassment of students and more
toward keeping students from harass-
ing each other.

For example, existing rules say
racial and ethnic harassment “include,
but are not restricted to, actions that
use ethnic, racial and religious char-
acteristics as a basis for discrimina-
tion against an individual in any
course, program or activity.”

But the proposed guidelines say
“ethnic, religious, racial and sexual

D Please see CRC page 3

The Phi deeply regrets the confusion.

Correction

An ticle in last week’s Ring-tum Phi incorrectly
stated the status of plans for sorority houses at Wash-
ington and Lee.

According to Panhellenic Housing Chairman Laurel
Ann Heiskell, site plans have been drawn up describ-
ing possible locations for sorority houses, but blue
prints do not yet exist. W&L will not begin serious
consideration of building the houses before 1992, and
construction will not begin for at least five years.

“There are no definite plans, and there will not be
any defninite plans for many years,” Heiskell said.

The Phi regrets the errors.

“The Lee-Jackson Lacrosse Clas-
sic is the brainchild of Lexington
City Manager Joe King,” said Rock-
bridge Area Recreation Association
spokesman Doug Chase. “It involves
a cooperative effort from the Lexing-
ton Community, Washington and Lee
University and Virginia Military
Institute and the Lexington Downtown
Development Association. ’ ’

The idea behind the classic is to
strengthen ties between the Lexington
community and the two colleges. For
the past two weeks, both W&L and
VMI and the city of Lexington have
strived to make an effort to become
closer together.

One beneﬁt of the classic, says
Chase, is teaching area youth about
lacrosse. Coaches and players from
both W&L and VMI along with Chad

had dinner together. At the dinner,
the players from both teams were
seated together in a effort to strength-
en the relationships between the
teams. On Wednesday, both institu-
tions and the city had a cocktail party
held in the Morris House.

“The evening functions give the
players an opportunity to know each
other in a non-lacrosse setting,” said
Chase.

The game is about more than just
lacrosse. “It is an honest effort by
the City of Lexington to reach out,”
said Chase.

Said Bartlett, “I'm thankful to
everyone involved in the game -— the
schools, RARO, the city, everyone
who has put forth the effort they've
all put forth to make this thing possi-
ble. It's agreat way to end a sea-
son, for everyone.”

 OPINION

Lacrosse is back
in the limelight

Saturday, the W&L men’s lacrosse team will end
one if its most surprising and enjoyable regular seasons
in recent memory when it plays VMI in the annual
Lee-Jackson Classic at Wilson Field. Everyone should
go.
In the past, W&L lacrosse has been measured by its
success in the postseason tournament. Although the
team has only an outside chance to make the eight-
team field this year, that should in no way dampen
what has been a remarkable turnaround.

As most of us are depressingly aware, W&L lacrosse
had fallen on hard times. The team's record for the
previous two seasons was 6-20. Ouch.

Since the arrival of new head coach Jim Stagnitta,
however, that has changed. This year, the team is 8-4
with one game remaining, and has a chance to return to
the NCAA tournament. In one season, W&L can return
W&L to its rightful status, as one of the premier
Division III lacrosse programs in the country.

There are lots of reasons to go to the game this
weekend. First, W&L has to win this game to have any
shot at the tournament. Second, watching VMI get
humiliated is always a good way to start a weekend.
Third, Coach Stagnitta and his players have earned our
respect and support this season, regardless of what
happens this weekend or in the tournament. The best
way we can show that is to be there Saturday.

Some ‘new ideas’
on college life

“Alcohol, drug abuse, crime and bigotry are
breaking down the social and intellectual fabric at many
college campuses.” So says The Associated Press in
summarizing a recent study by the Carnegie Foundation
and. the American Council on Education. The report
claims incidences of crime, sexual harrasnient and
alcohol abuse have increased steadily in the past five
years, and that college life has suffered accordingly.

According to the AP, two-thirds of the 382 college
presidents surveyed for the report said alcohol abuse is
at least a “moderate” problem on their campuses.
Some 43, percent, said crime had increased on their
caInpIi‘§e$ in .re9entI  And .slisbtly. :n10m:;than half
said, the’ [quality of campus life is ‘ of greater concern
than it was a few years ago.

What is the answer to all of this? Apparently, not
more rules and more deans. The college presidents said
they don't want to reinstate strict rules of behavior in
response to these apparent problems. “The goal is not
to have a list of unenforceable commandments. Rather
it is to asstue that all parts of college life are governed
by high standards,” the study says. “An educated
person, while always searching, is always guided by
civility and integrity.”

To us, that sounds an awful like what Gen. Robert
E. Lee said a long time ago. Wasn't it something about
expecting students to behave like gentlemen?

Maybe these guys are onto something.

North speech-t--recalls Gordon Liddyf

MY VIEW
By Michael Leapman

EDITOR'S NOTE: Last week, we
received a copy of the following col-
umn from Prof. Robert Johnson. In a
note accompanying the column, John-
son wrote, "The recent visit to the
campus by Oliver North brought to
mind an earlier appearance — nearly
ten years ago — by another convicted
felon, namely G. Gordon Liddy. of
Watergate infamy. I thought you might
be interested in how The Times of
London described his stay on our
campus.

The most sought-after lecturer on
American campuses talks ﬂuently of
death and violence, yet dresses with
studied sobriety. His grey pin-striped
suit tones in with his grey tie'with
white polka dots, over a white shirt
with button-down collar.

It all blends nicely with his irn—
maculate, bushy, grey-flocked hair
and moustache. In manner and ap-
pearance he is disconcertingly like
Mr. Enoch Powell, though better

Onhisleﬂlapelhewearsasrnall
pin,themiriiatureofarnedalribbori,
in great, white and black. 0. Gordon
Liddy explains tlnt this is an honor-
ary decoration front the New York
police department, normally given to
policemen who have performed acts
of exceptional courage but awarded to
him because the police like him.

This is the first of many ironies
about Liddy; for his fame rests on
his criminal record. He was convicted
of complicity in the 1972 Watergate
break-ins and served four and a half
years in prison

Four nights a week, on average,
he visits a university and talks for
two hours about the Watergate affair
and his broad philosophy. He charges
$3,600 for each appearance and draws
capacity audiences.

With no trace of remorse, he tells
students that Watergate was a sirriple
act of political intelligeriee—gathering
of which there had been plenty be-
fore; that there were irregularities in
histrialandthejudgealteredthe
record; andthathisvictimizationis a
symbol of America's present deca-
dence. The students cheer him to the
echo.
Last week Liddy took hirriself and
his message to Washington and Lee
University in Lexington, Virginia. To
be fair to American students in geri-
eral. I must point out that this is far
fromatypicalcampusltisoneof
the most conservative in America,
and proud of it.

At a reception for Liddy before
his speech, I asked some students
how that conservatism manifested

itself. “There's an underlying racism
here." said Doug Shipman, who is
studying politics. Of a student body
of 1,400, perhaps 40 are black.

It is also one of the only three
all-male universities remaining in the
United States — the exclusion of
women being a symptom of con-
servatism rather than a cause of it.

At the reception, Liddy sipped
sweet sherry from a brandy glass and
told of the treats he had in store for
us at the lecture. No holds, he as-
sured us, would be barred.

The students, most in blue blazers
and grey flannels, eagerly fed him
ammunition. Would he like to sum

“It’s a shame that people who
have done such despicable things
should be lauded. It's a case in point
that evil does pay off."

Meanwhile, the talk in Liddy's
group was turning to one of his fa-
vorite subjects, assassination. Asked
about the murder in London of a
Bulgarian emigre with the poisoned
tip of an umbrella, he said sagely:
“We have our ways and they have
theirs” before launching into a de-
tailed explanation of how the poison
worked.

“You don't assassinate people as
an act of revenge," he mused. ‘‘It’s
a preventive thing... if Jane Fonda

up the Carter administration in one
word? “Hopeless.”

Had the Watergate experience
changed him spiritually? “No. it con-
firmed my world view. The big fish
always eat up the little fish."

Most students loved it, but there
were dissenters. Though no women
are formally enrolled, six are on an
exchange program from a nearby
women's college. One of them, Laura

, O'Hear, said:

had done in the Second World War
what she did in the Vietnam War,
she would have been shot or electro-
cuted.

It has been documented how
Liddy, at one stage in his career,
recorrunended the assassination of
Jack Anderson, an investigative jour-
nalist, but was over-ruled by higher
authority. Another candidate for elirn-
ination whom he mentioned was
Philip Agee, who wrote an embar-

rassing book about the Central Intellii
gence Agency. ;
“Would you do it yourself?" he“
was asked “Like swatting a fly," he
answered. ‘
The hall was overﬂowing by thé
time Liddy came to speak. In this»
term’s two previous iectures, by
respectable but dull senators from the!
two major parties, there was an em-‘‘
barrassing expanse of empty space.
Not tonight. Students in T-shirtsi
and sweaters spread into the aisles.
and packed the gallery. Their ap-"
plause was as loud and insistent as,v.
machine-gun fire as Liddy strode on
to the stage. t
“Everything seems to be going
wrong for us at home and abroad,"
he began. “Americans tend to live at
life of illusion. Either they are unable
to comprehend reality or they tend to‘
turn away from it, hoping it will go’

I . away."

This retreat from reality, he said,i.
wasreflectedinthegrowinguseof
euphemisrns. “If you fossilize lani
guage you fossilize thought. You
can't buy a used car any more -
orily a previously owned one. I was,
in eight prisons and not one was
called a prison: they were penitentia-i
ries, even though I never met anyone
in them who was penitent." ,

Such obfuscation, Liddy said,’
derives from a confusion between the
world as it is and the world as we,
wantittobe.Thisledhimintoa
criticism of Mr. Carter‘: presidency.i

“There is nothing wrong in talk-
ing to God," he said, in a referencd
to Mr. Carter's faith. “It is when
God starts talking back and tells you
how to run the country that you have

a problem, especially if he tells you '

one thing one day and something else‘
the next.” _
The students loved it, for the mosl
part, though one, in the questi
period, did say: “I regret that four
andahalfyearsofprisonforyout
was all that was needed to satisfy the
nation's interest." 5‘
Liddy shrugged: “I played by met
rules I found in effect at the time." ,
The questioning reverted to kill-it
ing. Could homicide ever be justiﬁedl
in whatever cause? “The Decalogue‘;'i
does not say thou shalt not kill,"’
Liddy replied. “It says thou shalt not
do murder... these things are tougliu
but you must face therri.” 1
What happens after death?_.*
“Worms,” Liddy replied monosyllab-9
ically, gaining his loudest applause off
all

my motel room, the first reports were?
coming in of the murder of John‘
Lennon, a victim of a society

The Lexington Planning Commis-
sion is scheduled to review the archi-
tectural plans for the renovation of
fraternity houses on Red Square at
their meeting next Thursday, accord-
ing to City Manager Joe King.

Before Washington and Lee can
apply for a building permit and start
the renovation of the fraternities, the
Planning Commission and the Archi-
tectural Board must approve the site
plans which were submitted by W&L
this Monday.

King said the plans must meet
two sets of standards before con-
struction will be allowed.

“First, the Planning Commission
primarily looks at aspects of the site
to see if they meet requirements for
things like adequate drainage, street
access and the relationship of the
building to utility lines,” King said.

King said the Planning Commis-

sion should approve the site plans
easily, since the houses are not being
built, only renovated

The plans will also be presented
to the Architectural Review Board,
which must review all building plans
involving the Lexington Historic
Dist.rict.

“In any historic area, you must
get permission to do anything to an
existing structure. That includes the
color of the paint, fixtures that are
added on the outside of a building,
like shutters, or repairs to the roo ,”
King said.

Once the Planning Commission
and the Architectural Review Board
consider the plans, they must be sub-
mitted to council for approval.

King said he thought the plans
would go before Council at their
meeting May 17. The university can
then apply for a building permit and
start commotion on Red Square.

According to King, Washington
and Lee has already recieved a build-
ing permit for the SAE house on

Threatening possible social proba-
tion, Lewis said, “I don't want to,
but I’m gonna dick you over if the
alumni mess up your house.”

Atkins agreed. “The alumni are
only in your house as your guests. If
they get out of hand, ask them to
leave. If they won't, you should call
the police."

Also, Atkins complained that he
felt an editorial in last week’s edition
of The Ring—tum Phi presented the
wrong image of W&L. Saying he is
opposed to having a spring term, he
said telling the world that students do
little studying during spring term
reﬂects badly on W&L.

Lewis and Atkins said that turnout
at last Saturday's IFC leadership con-
ference was disappointing. Represen-
tatives from six houses were on hand
to hear presentations on risk manage-
,ment, financial responsibility and
leadership.

“The turnout made the fraternity

system look bad. It made y’all look
bad, and it made Buddy and I look
ba ,” said Lewis.

Atkins said that the Alumni Frat-
ernity Council, which sponsored the
event, was trying to create a forum
in which fraternity leaders could talk
back and give input to the alumni.

“When no one shows up to an
event like this because it conﬂicts
with their social schedule, that looks
ba ,” said Atkins.

Atkins relayed a message from
university President John Wilson
about vandalism on Lee Avenue. A
resident had written the school last
year complaining that party-goers
were vandalizing cars parked on the
street.

In a letter received by Wilson last
week, the resident said that there had
been no incidents of vandalism in the
past seven months, and he thanked
the houses for keeping things under
control, according to Atkins.

“A group of black cadets had
come out to try to break things up,
but the more they tried to break it
up, the more things carried on,”
Murray said. “Some of the blacks
were being very belligerent."

The crowd was outside when the
police arrived When Coffey tried to
disperse them, the crowd attacked
him, according to Murray.

“All of the sudden, two or three
of them jumped him and dragged him
all the way across the street and
under the front end of a parked car,
where they were beating him,” said

‘ Murray, who had gone outside to

assist the officers in dispersing the
crowd.
. Lexington police Chief Bruce
Beard said at least three separate
' fights broke out in the crowd. He

people might have been injured.
I “We were very lucky that more
people weren't hurt,” he said.

who saw the incident, said, “It seem-
ed like something out of Alabama in

him.”

According to witnesses, Officer
A.M. Miller began chasing one of the
attackers down Lee Avenue and a
group of about 20 people began to
chase him.

After the police began to gain
control of the situation, the crowd
moved down Washington Street to
the front of Lloyd’s.

Police requested Lloyd's to close
for the evening, and it reopened at 6
a.m.

A Lexington resident who wit-
nessed the event said that things grew
totally out of proportion.

“The law couldn’t seem to get
nothing accomplished. It should have
been only one fight. Some of the
people I lmew couldn't afford to be
in any more trouble with the law, so
I tried to tell them it was stupid," he
said.

Lang said he heard the man de-
nouncing the black-on—black violence
to the crowd.

“It just wasn't worth going to jail
for,” the man said.

Council to consider housing plans

Washington Street and is authorized
to begin commotion at any time.

King said the Planning Commis-
sion has voted to table its proposal
for new zoning regulations, which
were supposed to be submitted for
approval by Council this week and
would go into effect July 1.

The proposed rules would allow
only three noise or litter violations
annually for single family dwellings
housing more than four unrelated
people.

If the occupants were convicted of
more than three violations, they could
lose their conditional use permit. In
such a case, any additional tenants
would have to move out.

The Plarming Commission decided
to delay the implementation of the
regulation when it discovered that
buildings requiring a permit to house
more than four unrelated people had
not been adequately inspected.

“The inspection of the houses
was inadequate and the requirements
were not fully met," said King. “The

Planning Commission tabled all appli-
cations for the conditional use permits
and will bring a recommendation to
Council when the inspections are
properly conducted.”

King said the conditional use
permit is granted if a structure meets
certain criteria, including health and
safety requirements.

City council has set a July 1
deadline for landlords to apply for a
conditional use permit.

King said structures like frater-
nity houses and dormitories are zoned
like apartment buildings, and the new
zoning regulations would not apply.

Two new members of Council
were elected Tuesday and will take
office in July. According to The News
Gazette, they are Patrick Mayerchak,
political science professor at Virginia
Military Institute, and Timothy Gold-
en, VMI’s director of financial aid.
Leaving Cotmcil will be J.E. "Jim"
Mays and Laurence A. Mann, who
both did not seek re—e1ection.

harassment includes, but is not limit-
ed to, threats or actions that are
intended to use ethnic, racial, reli-
gious or sexual characteristics” in
one of three ways: to “insult, harm,
embarass or demean”; to “create a
hostile or intimidating environment”;
or to “discriminate against an in-
dividual in any course, program or
social activity."

The CRC proposed other changes
in its definition of sexual harassment,
which now refers to “verbal or phys-
ical conduct of a sexual nature when

submission to such conduct is made
either explicitly or implicitly a term
or condition of an individual’s em-
ployment or status in a course, pro-
gram or activity.”

The new description of sexual
harassment instead refers to “verbal
or physical acts of a sexual nature"
that are committed “by force, threat
or intimidation” or “through the use
of a victim’s mental or physical
condition or incapacity of which the
perpetrator was, or should have been,
aware.”

another perfect two-on-one break. As
he was slashed on the head, Mose-
man was able to thread the needle
with a pass to Mastrogiovanni on the
run, and Mastrogiovanni was able to
beat Redd under the crossbar to give
W&L an 8-4 lead.

After another H-SC goal, W&L
went on the extra-man offense. The
Generals worked the ball behind to
Moseman. As two cutters went to the
net, Moseman fed Garliss 15-yards
out, and, with 1:02 left in the half,
his shot beat Redd for his third goal
of the day to give W&L a 9-5 half-
time lead.

In the third quarter, with Tripp
Heilig in goal, the Tigers cut the
W&L lead to 11-9 with 1:06 to play.
But just 12 seconds later, Roberts had
the answer, off a feed from Garliss,
for his third goal of the day and
pushed the lead back to 12-9 to start
the fourth quarter.

Jones then put the game out of
reach with two fourth-quarter goals,
both unassisted, to give the Generals
a 14-9 lead. H-SC scored on a two-
man advantage with just 15 seconds

Track teams
fare well in
ODAC meets

By John Neumann
Staff Reporter

   

In Saturday’s Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference championships, the
Washington and Lee women’s track
team captured the unofficial crown
behind Beth Stutzrnann while Wes
Boyd led the men's charge that fell
just ﬁve points short of the title.

The men ran well and had strong
contributions from everyone down the
line but could not catch Lynchburg
College, the eventual winner.

Head coach Norris Aldridge said,
“Obviously, you’re disappointed
every time you don't win, but we had
a great effort from our team. Every-
one did what they could and we had
an outstanding performance.’ ’

Boyd, a senior, was voted ODAC
Runner—of-the—Year with a tremendous
effort last Saturday. He won the 100-
meter run, 200-meter run, and ran a
leg on both relay teams, the 4x100-
meter winning relay and the second-
place 4x400-meter relay.

Senior Scott Williams also con-
tributed. He won the 400-meter rim
with a time of 48.9 seconds. Wil-
liams also participated on both relay
teams and took third in the 200-meter
run.
Junior Carl Gilbert kept busy all
day participating in ten events. He
ﬁnished second in the long jump de-
spite setting the school record. He
also took fourth in the 200-rneter run
and sixth in the 100—meter run. Gil-
bert also ran a leg on both relay
teams.

Junior David Martin accomplished
a rare feat. He won both the 1500-
and the 5000-meter runs. Junior Jeff
Baucum ran his best 800-meter run
breaking 2:00 for the first time in his
career.

Freshman David Phillips, harn-
pered by a hamstring injury through-
out most of the season, ran the 400-
meter intermediate hurdles and tin-
ished a second with a time of 56.2
seconds.

“It was a great day,” is how
women’s head coach John Tucker
described his team’s performance.
The women’s 172 points outdistanced
Eastern Mennonite by 31 points.

At the head of the women’s class
was Beth‘ Stutzmarui. The senior set
three school records while winning
five individual events, accumulating
60.5 team points. Besides winning the
100-meters, 200—metcrs, hurdles, long
jump and high jump. Stutzmann was
second in the triple jump and ran a

Morris, men
defend crown

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

The Washington and Lee men's
tennis team ﬁnished the regular sea-
son in familiar fashion, wimiing the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
tournament held April 27-28 in
Lynchburg.

The Generals, led by defending
NCAA Division III singles and dou-
bles champion John Morris, finished
10 points ahead of Lynchburg, who
ﬁnished second.

Morris, a senior, defended his
championship at No. 1 singles with
three straight set wins, defeating J.P.
Simanis of Hampden-Sydney 6-1, 6-
2 in the quarterfmals, winning his
semiﬁnal match 7-5, 6-0 and handing
Laurent Oomec of Bridgewater his
first loss of the year 7-5, 6-1 in the
final.

Morris earned ODAC Player-of-
the-Year honors for the second
straight year. He teamed with junior
Bill Meadows to win the No. 1 dou-
bles ﬂight, defeating Tom Sullivan
and Todd Klyver of Lynchburg 6-3,
6-2 in the ﬁnals. Morris and Mead-
ows are currently ranked tenth in the
nation in doubles play.

With his two championships,
Morris now becomes an eight-time
ODAC champion, winning both of
his ﬂights in all four years he has
played

The Generals won ﬁve of the six
singles ﬂights and the No. 1 doubles
ﬂight. It was the first time since
1986 that the team did not win all
nine ﬂights. In 1986, W&L was
defeated at the No. 1 singles ﬂight.

“The challenge this year was to
win all nine ﬂights," said head coach
Gary Franke. “We weren't able to do
that, but we still were able to come
away with the title. We had beaten
the top two other teams 7-2 each so
we felt very confident coming in."

Senior Billy Tunner captured the
No. 2 singles title, defeating Steve
Horowitz of Lynchburg 6-4, 6-3 in
the finals. Meadows captured the No.
3 ﬂight with a tough 7-5, 7-6 (7-2)
win over Klyver.

Junior Reid Manley won his No.
4 singles ﬂight easily with a 6-2, 6-
1 win over Gardner Cobb of H-SC,
and senior John Sutterlin came
through with the No. 6 singles title,
defeating Greg Holland of Lynchburg
in three sets, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.

Sophomore Jack Tinney, who had
been playing No. 6, moved up to No.
5, where he ﬁnished second, losing in

the ﬁnals to Scott Watson of Lynch-
burg 6-3, 6-4.

At No. 2 doubles, Turmer and
Manley lost in the semiﬁnals in three
sets to eventual champions Sirnanis

and Rand DuPriest (H-SC) ea, 44,“

To his teammates and friends
Chris Mast.rogiovanni is simply
known as Mastro. Perhaps they
should insert an ‘e’ to his nick-
name, preferring instead to call
him Maestro.

For that is what Mastro-
giovanni has become this season
for W&L’s lacrosse team, a mas-
ter in the art of scoring, exhibit-
ing eminence as the conductor of
the offensive attack.

Although the Generals played
only three games in April, Mas-
trogiovanni, a key to W&L’s
1990 lacrosse resurgence, scored
nine goals. He had a career-high
six goals, the first two coming in
a 13-second span, in a 25-1 vic-
tory over Virginia Wesleyan, one
goal in a 12-4 loss to No. 2
Washington College and two
goals in a 14-10 win over No. 16
Harnpden-Sydney.

For his acheivements, Mastro—
giovanni has been named The
Ring-tum Phi’s Athlete-of-the-
Month for April.

Mastrogiovanni’s accomplish-
ments are even more impressive
when viewed against the backdrop
of the entire season. After 12
games the seniAoratt_a_c_lgnan from

The Ring-tum Phl, May 3, 1990

[ATHLETE-OF-THE-MONTH‘

Geneva, N.Y., has 41 points with
36 goals and ﬁve assists.

What is more striking is his
accuracy. His goal scoring has
come from only 79 shots, giving
him a shooting percentage of 45.6
per cent, which is oddly high for
a lacrosse player. As a compari-
son, W&L’s leading scoring in
basketball this year, Chris Jacobs,
shot 44.0 percent.

Mastrogiovanrii has also regis-
tered eight hat tricks this season
and he scored 19 goals during a
four-game stretch. He scored ﬁve
goals against No. 6 Gettysburg,
including the garne—winner with
:44 remaining in overtime. He
collected ﬁve goals and an assist
in a 13-11 win over Middlebury,
scoring twice in 28 seconds, and
picked up three more goals in a
13-12 overtime win at No. 15
Guilford.

Playing on the crease of a low
double stack offense, Mastro-
giovanrii is W&L’s go~to guy,
beneﬁtting from passes from
attackrnen Mike Moseman and
Jeff Roberts and midﬁelders Todd
Garliss and Clark Wight. The
offense is designed for Mastro-
giovanni and it is his job to ﬁnish
the break and get the goals.

“I expected to do this well
(this season),” Mastrogiovarmi

said. “I feel at home on the
crease as an attackman. We have
a new coach [Jim Stagnitta] and
before the season he said that I
move well off the ball. He
thought that attack was where I
would help the team the most.”

Mastrogiovanni played his first
three seasons at midﬁeld, where
he was the most-improved player
in 1988. As a freshman he had
two goals and two assists for the
team that advanced to the Div-
ision III Final Four. As a soph-
omore and junior, when W&L
was 2-11 and 4-9, he had a total
of 24 goals.

Heading into Sunday's game
against VMI the Generals, 8-4,
have an outside chance of making
the eight-team NCAA tournament.

“Everyone’s pretty excited and
happy that we're winning again,
especially the seniors. We have
people playing in positions where
they’ll give the best output,"
Mastrogiovarmi said.

Set to graduate next month
with a degree in psychology,
Mastrogiovanni said he plans to
continue his involvement in the
game he has played since the ﬁfth
grade.

“I’ll probably play in a sum-
mer league and maybe a club
team. Hopefully I’m going to do

some coaching.”

...wins eighth ODAC title

6-2. At No. 3 doubles, the team of
Sutterlin and freshman Travis West,
inserted during the tearn’s Florida
trip, also lost in the semiﬁnals, fall-
ing to Cobb and Drew Grice (I-I-SC)
6-1, 7-6 (10-8).

The Generals are currently ranked
13th in the nation, and only 12 teams
will receive bids to the NCAA tour-
narnent. Said Frarike, “Right now,
it's between Rochester, St. John’s and
W&L, and I honestly don’t know
who will make the tournament. There
are no real difference between the
teams.”

Bids will be given out on May
14. The Generals have been to the
tournament each of the last four
years, winning the National Champi-
onship in 1988.

tie for ﬁfth place in the individual
standings.

Thomas was selected ODAC Golf-
er of the Year and Piatt was named
Coach of the Year. But when Piatt
and the team returned to Lexington,

he presented Leslie with the placque.
Said Piat, “This is Buck's team. I
was just lucky enough to keep the
boat in the right direction. The award
is a credit to the strength of the golf
program that Buck has put together
here at'W&L.”

Next the Generals will have to
wait until May 14 to see if the sea-
son will continue. “May I4 is when
the conference call will take place to
give out NCAA tournament bids,”
said Piatt. “It looks very good that
we will get a team bid.”

“If you win your conference,”
said Leslie, “then they [the NCAA]
have to take a long look at you. We
haven't played as many rounds as
some other teams, but we have the
advantage that we won the confer-
ence, and that will get us a long
loo .”

Should the team get a bid or not,
Thomas will also be submitted for an
individual bid. The NCAA touma-
ment will be held the weekend of
May 19.

On the day, Roberts, Garliss and
Jones had three goals apiece, while
Mastrogiovanni and Wight added two
each. Junior goalie Tom Costello
came up big when he had to, making
12 saves.

Although he didn’t score, Chris
Kennedy had to be the star of the
game for W&L. The senior faceoff
specialist won an amazing 27 of 28
and the last 19 he took. Senior de-
fensman Reid Campbell won the only
faceoff he attempted as the Generals
won 28 of 29 and the last 20 on the
afternoon.

“Aside from the games against
Virginia and Washington College,
Chris has been pretty much dominat-
ing the faceoffs," said Stagnitta.
“He's been doing a great job of
getting us the ball when we need it
in the pressure situations."

The Tigers elected to play man-
to-man defense throughout, and that
proved to be their downfall. Continu-
ally W&L offensive players would
beat their deferisernen and no one
would slide to help out for the Ti-
gers, leaving wide open shots.

“We knew they would play man-

knew we were adept at playing

against the zone," said Stagnitta.
“l’ve seen them play games where
they have slip well and games when
they haven't. Sunday they didri’t slide

well at all." _

“We were able to open up a big
lead. Once we got the big lead. they
had to play man. If they switch to
zone, then we just be patient and
work the ball around."

The Generals, 8-4, 3-2 in Old
Dominion Athletic Conference play,
defeated Harnpden—Sydney and tin-
ished over .500 in ODAC play for
the first time since 1987, when they
went to the NCAA Division III Final
Four. This season the Generals have
defeated four teams ranked in the
Division III Top 20 (H-SC was rank-
ed 16th).

W&L will close out the season
Saturday at 3:00 on Wilson Field in
the Third Annual Lee-Jackson La-
crosse Classic against cross-town rival
VMI. W&L won last year 10-9 on
Douoguih’s goal in sudden-deatli
overtime.

“It's a big game for us," said
Stagnitta. “We have to win to keep
our goal of being in the playoffs
alive. And for the seniors, it's their
last opportunity to shine.”

leg on the winning relay team.

The other dominating woman was
sophomore LaShawn King, who won
the 400-meter run while setting a
school record of 63.08 seconds. She
also took second place in the high
jump, third in the long jump, fourth
in the 200-meters and sixth in the
100-meters. She also participated in
both relays.

Said Tucker, “We won the meet
with fewer girls than EMC so most
girls were in multiple events." Tuc-
ker called the day an “endurance
test” and was pleased with his team
and the steady progress they made
throughout the year was very gratify-
ing for a coach.

Both the men and women lose
valuable performers off their teams.
The women lose Stutzmann. Howev-
er, even though Tucker is sorry to
see her leave, he has three freshmen
coming in who he feels will make up
that difference along with his retum-
ing team members.

The men lose Boyd, pole-vaulter
Phillip Sampson, sprinter Tie Sos-
nowski, and Williams. Aldridge also
wishes that they could remain, but he
knows he has a strong nucleus retum-
ing, including Gilbert, Martin, and
Baucurn.

East Lex

Jim Bowen discusses his ownership of a W&L tradition

By Todd Peppers
Entertainment Columnist

At the end of last week's review,
I remarked that my next column
would explore the wondrous delights
of East Lex. I meant it to be a joke.
tlnfortunately, my editors didn’t catch
the subtle (asinine) humor and
promptly allotted space for my arti-
cle. When I learned of their confu-
sion my first reaction was, well,
unprintable. Then I began to think
about it. A story on East Lex...why
not? To many Washington and Lee
students East Lex rivals House Moun-
tain and Goshen as a permanent, and
beloved, landmark of the area.

"There has been an East Lex
since l936," said owner James ‘Jim’
Bowen. "Back in the old days this
used to be a coun store. There
were no Krogers at that time, and
East Lex carried grain, feed, coal,
and even salt blocks. The store also
had a lunch counter and delivered
groceries to its customers."

A store similar to East Lex can
be found in every small town in the
United States. Although the building
has not completely escaped the rav-
ages of time, it has an air of serenity
and permanence. The store sits on
the side of Rt. 11, bearing a faded
sign that says "East Lexington Store
Quick Stop." Metal signs proclaim-
ing "Rainbo is Good Bread" and
"Marlboro Man" dot the building's
sides. Two gasoline pumps stand
guard in front of the store. Trucks
and cars are placed haphazardly
across the parking lot. This Norman
Rockwell painting only lacks an
ancient hound dog sleeping in the
shade.

Inside the air is motionless and
cool. The shelves are stuffed with
every conceivable item: ﬁshing tackle,
shotgun shells, bread, comcob pipes,
beef jerky, shirts, newspapers, ﬁre-
works, Elvis bubble gums cards,
lunch meats, cups, pickles, Red Man
chewing tobacco, baseball hats, and
tooth-ache drops. The store even
sells the kind of magazines that
mother wouldn’t let into the house.
And the silence is broken by the

have that people ask for are wine and

Granted the store is crammed with
endless supplies. Yet Washington
and Lee students think of two things
when the name East Lex pops up in
conversation: Beer specials and Jim
Bowen. If you are having that Satur-

likely you arrive at East Lex to check
out Jim's legendary specials.

"We carry all the domestic beers

imported beers," according to Jim,

special posted all the time. The

East Lex without Jim, or vice versa.
"I have owned East Lex for fourteen
years," said Jim. "I lived down the
road from the store when I was a
child, and started working here when
I was thirteen ’of"‘fourteen. With the
money I earned from my job, I was
able to send myself to the University
of Richmond."

Jim graduated from the University
of Richmond in 1970 and returned to
Lexington. He taught at the local
high school and coached both the
baseball team and the junior varsity
basketball team. But in the late
1970s he returned to his boyhood
haunt and assumed his place in the
Washington and Lee psyche. And
for many of his customers, whether
they be Washington and Lee students,
Virgiiﬁa Military Institute cadets, or
local folks, Jim is a good friend.

worked here, the problems I have had

relationship."

Jim added that "the students who
come into the store I consider friends,
and I hope they consider me a friend.
They are another part of my job that
makes it a pleasure."

Jim spends a lot of time behind
the counter. "I probably spend be-
tween seventy-five to eighty hours a
week at work." He also has two or
three ladies who help him out. East
Lex is opened from 9:00 a.m. to

Report: EC breaks constitution

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

This year's Executive Committee
has gone into executive session in
several instances when it was not
allowed by the student body constitu-
tion, according to a report submitted
to the EC Monday night.

The Constitutional Revisions Com-
mittee submitted to the Executive
Committee Monday its proposals to
amend the student body constitution,
which included a clariﬁcation of
executive session.

The proposal allows the EC to
hold closed—door, executive sessions
for honor investigations and trials,
committee appointment interviews,
disciplinary hearings, and discipline in

honor-related matters as outlined in
White Book Section 0.

The measure forbids closed—door
or executive sessions for budget hear-
ings and deliberations, and committee
appointrnet deliberations.

“Past and present Executive Com-
mittees have chosen to disregard the
constitution on this issue,” reads the
revisions corr1rnittee’s rationale. The
EC “has seen fit to change the rules,
and the present guidelines have be-
come irrelevant.”

The committee said executive
session was invoked for an FD
budget hearing earlier this year.

Second-year law Rep. Mark Cobb,
who phoned in the deciding vote last
week to close EC—elect committee
appointment deliberations, objected
that the proposal allowed no “flex-

ibility.” If personality conflicts arose
in an interview, he reasoned, or the
interviewee provided information he
deemed confidential, the EC would be
unable to consider it in open delibera-
tions.

Revisions committee member
Walter Scott told Cobb, “I wish
you’d voted to have those delibera-
tions open. You voted against the
constitution.’ '

He explained that if open delib-
erations had been unsuccessful, the
revisions committee might have
reconsidered that part of the proposal.
However, since deliberations were
voted closed, the revisions committee
made a decision based on the seem-
ing intent of the constitution.

The confidentiality in disciplinary
matters, Falk explained, is to allow

the EC to conduct an investigation,
but if action is taken the EC must
“fully describe all facts and cir-
cumstances surrounding the disposi-
tion of the matter" in its regular
meeting.

Other proposals concerned suc-
cession of Big Three-elect, special
elections to fill vacant offices_, adjust-
ments to allow earlier elections, and

the ﬁscal role of the Publications
Board as an “umbrella” organization.

The revisions committee also
proposed a revitalized University
Lectures Committee to coordinate
guest lecturers and administer the
anticipated Telford Grant for lec-
turers. That proposal is not a con-
stitutional amendment.

EC Vice President—elect Raymond
Welder said that he hopes the EC
will leave the Constitutional Re-
visions Cornmittee’s proposals for
consideration next year.

Constitutional procedure requires
a two-thirds vote of the EC to send
an amendment to referendum, where
two—thirds of the student body, with
at least half voting, may adopt it.

The EC—elect posted their com-
mittee appointments Monday night.

Members’ voting records were also
made public.

The EC gave Kathleen Duwel the
Student Activities Board chair, 6-5,
with William Jones unanimously
chosen as vice chair. Charles
Krariich made Contact chairman. 9-2.
Other chairs went unanimously to
Andrew Gaffney, Voting Regulations
Board; Robert Shelton, Financial
Relations Committee; Thomas Spur-
geon, Student Conduct Committee
(Spurgeon abstaining): and John
Donaldson, Mock Convention. The
Emergency Loan Committee chair
went to Jeffrey Rogers.

The EC—elect decided to wait in
ﬁlling these positions: SAB opera-
tions director; Fancy Dress chairman,
vice chairman and auditor; and Mock
Convention secretary.

IFC votes to
change rules

Social probation guidelines
and rush sites discussed

By Jason Kelley
Senior Copy Editor

The Interfratemity Council took
the first step to change the definition
of social probation at its Tuesday
night meeting, and the six houses that
will be under renovation during fall
rush reached an agreement to use a
lottery system to distribute meetirng
places for rush functions.

The IFC voted unanimously to
send a proposed amrnendment to the
IFC by-laws to the Student Affairs
Committee for approval.

If approved, the arnmendment
would change the restrictions imposed
on houses while they are on social
probation. The amrnendrnent would
prohibit more than 25% of the mem-
bership of the fraternity house to
gather outside the house for any non-
university sponsored function of a
social nature.

This would supercede the current
by-law which states that no more
than 5 members of the fraternity may
gather for a non—university sanctioned

function.

IFC President Goodloe Lewis said
that this change comes in the wake
of Phi Kapppa Sigma having their
social probation extended by the
SAC.

Admitting that Phi Kapp broke the
actual letter of the law by having
more than 5 brothers together while
they were on social probation, Lweis
said that the IFC had let Phi Kapp
off because it did not feel that they
had broken with the spirit of the rule.

Lewis said that fraternities must
start following the rules in the consti-
tution and that the IFC must start
enforcing them.

“But,” he added, “If we believe
that the rule sucks, we've got to
change it.”

Associate Dean of Students for
Fraternity Affairs Leroy “Buddy”
Atkins, argued in the meeting for a
tougher rule. ,

He said that he felt both the cur-
rent rule and the proposed amend-
ment were not strong enough.

W&L Gives Delta Gamma will colonize in Fall

$100,000
to city

By Fraser Bowen
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee has given a
$100,000 gift to the city of Lex-
ington, announced Mayor H.E.
“Buddy" Derrick at the May 3 Lexi-
ngton City Council meeting.

“I think that this heralds a new
relationship between the city and
Washington and Lee,” said Derrick.

The gift was approved by W&L’s
Board of Trustees at the board’s
meeting in February, according to
university Treasurer Larry W. Broom-
all.

The board’s action provides for a
onetime unrestricted capital grant to
the city. It is intended to recompense
the city for lost tax revenue.

Broomall said that the grant is
essentially in response to a proposal
by the city that the university pur-
chase bonds for the new consolidated
city-county high school, the plans for
which were approved in a Rockbridge
County referendum last spring.

Broomall said, at the time the
high school was originally proposed,
the university thought it would be
unwise to invest in such a low-yield
venture.

The grant to the city is un-
restricted, so the city may use it in
any way that it chooses, however,
Derrick said he would like to “ear-
mark” the inoncy to go towards
construction of the consolidated high-
school.

The consolidated high school is
expected to cut the combined costs
for local high school education by 50
percent.

After five months of deliberation and a
January decision to delay colonization, Delta
Gamma has agreed to return to Washington and
Lee to colonize in the fall in hopes of becom-
ing W&L’s fourth sorority, according to Associ-
ate Dean of Students Leroy “Buddy” Atkins.

Atkins said he received a letter of confir-
mation late last week from DG formally accept-
ing the university's invitations to colonize here,
although a 15-member DG interest group has
been meeting since January in order to increase
interest among the unaffiliated women on
campus in a new sorority.

In the letter, DG President Maureen Syring
said that although “the numbers have quite
frankly been disappointing, the determination
this group has exhibited has been impressive.”

Syring went on to say that DG held a
national Council meeting in late April, with the
colonization at W&L a major part of the agen-
da.

There the Council voted unanimously to
support a DG colonization in the fall, using the
local interest group as the core of women who
will help with this effort.

As part of their colonization, DG will hold
a rush in the fall for all independent upperclass-
men. It will then rush again in the winter with
the other three sororities currently on campus,
Kappa Alpha Theta, Chi Omega, and Kappa
Kappa Gamma.

According to DG Colonization Coordinator
Kitty Beatty, DG has not yet set a date for its
fall rush. Beatty said that the dates will be set
in accordance with the W&L and DG calendars.

Interest group President Elizabeth Besen-
felder expressed a concern that, because DG’s
installation period is 12 weeks long, the girls

who pledged in the fall might not be active
members by winter, or they would be initiating
around exam time.

Beatty said that the DG pledge period had
an amount of flexibility, although its too early
to say if DG will attempt to initiate before
Christmas break.

Beatty also said that the colony should be
able to meet certain standard requirements
before it is installed. The requirements basi-
cally deal with the colony's readiness to be a
chapter, which includes its financial situation,
mles and by-laws, OffIC6l'S and its philanthropic
activities.

DG will be the only sorority allowed to
rush upperclassrnen in the fall. In the mean
time DG has requested the names and addresses
of all unaffiliated women and permission to
contact them over the summer with information
and specific dates that DG will be on campus.

Newspaper adds to Smith fund

 

By Brian Root
Editor

The Tampa (Fla) Tribune and its parent
company, the Media General chain, have
contributed $16,000 to the Todd C. Smith

v Memorial Fellow-
ship Fund at
Washington and Lee.

As of April, 392
donors have con-
tributed $53,553 to
the fund. The goal is
to collect $100,000.

“We are delight-
ed by the gift from
Media General and
The Tampa Trib-
une,” said W&L
Director of Develop-
ment Lex McMillan. “It is a very beautiful
and generous gesture. We are grateful.”

 

Smith

The fund was established earlier this
year by the family and friends of Smith, a
1983 graduate of W&L, after he was tor-
tured and murdered by terrorists in the drug-
producing Huallaga region of Peru.

The fellowship is designed to help aspir-
ing journalists at W&L to become foreign
correspondents by providing a stipend to
travel and study in the country of their
choice for a specified amount of time.

The fellowship is open to any rising
junior or senior enrolled at W&L. The
recipient’s research and study will focus on
a topic of current interest and importance
and is expected to produce a journalistic
work that the Tribune will consider for
publication.

Smith, a former editor of The Ring-tum
Phi and a reporter for the Tribune, was
killed while investigating the Peruvian drug
trade.

As was reported in November in the Phi,
Smith decided to devote his vacation from

the paper to travel to Peru, because the
paper had refused to assign the story to him,

W&L,” Syring said in her letter. Atkins said
that university's response will be “great.”

According to Besenfelder, 12 members of
the interest group have formally comrriitted
themselves to nish DG in the fall and that at
least three more girls probably will. The group
currently holds meetings every week and tries
to recruit interested females and “get ourselves
known on campus,” said Besenfelder. The
interest group also has a DG advisor, Lexington
resident Patricia Gamer.

Besenfelder, who is one of the founders of
the interest group, said facetiously “We're the
scraggler group," explaining that all 15 mem-
bers were either not extended bids or did not
sign preference cards.

However, Besenfelder said that the girls who
did not get bids had indicated to the other three

OPINION

EC needs to read
the constitution

Last week the Executive Committee-elect voted 6-5 not
to open to the public deliberations on committee
appointments and went into executive session. The Student
Body Constitution states that executive sessions — defined
as a “private meeting of the EC”in which the “door is to
be closed at all times” - are to be called only in cases of
honor violations. Something is wrong with this picture.

This action by the EC could not have come at a better
time for the Constitutional Revisions Committee to prove its
point.

According to the proposals for change to the constitution
submitted by the committee Monday night the EC has
“chosen to disregard the constitution” on the issue of
executive session.

The proposals refer to last fall when the EC granted to
Alex Hitz, then Fancy Dress chairman, an executive session
to present the FD budget. Budget hearings are not to be
held in private. All members of the W&L community have
the right to know how its committees are spending their
money.

When the EC voted to close deliberations last week it
acted against the constitution. A vote to open the
deliberations should not have been taken. Such a meeting
should be assumed open. The proposal clearly defines which
meetings are to be private and which are to be public.The
only meetings that could be held behind closed doors are:
honor violations and investigations, disciplinary hearings and
interviews for committee appointments, and these only on a
two-thirds vote.

Deliberations on appointments, budget hearings and
budget deliberations could never be held in Executive
Session, as it should be.

The members of the EC who last week voted to keep the
deliberations closed ought to read the constitution. The
committee needs to be congratulated for its effort to remind
the EC that they are not separate, but are a part of, the
student body. And they, too, have rules to follow.

Welcome back
home, y’a||

This weekend, a whole ton of alumni are coming back to
W&L to visit. Ladies and gentlemen, glad to have you here.

Without doubt, W&L is a different place than the one
you attended. For better or worse, however, we think you’ll
notice a lot has remained the same.

On the front page, we ran a story about how some people
think the EC is behaving incorrectly. If you ask around,
you’ll probably ﬁnd out that fraternities feel harassed by the
administration, and the faculty think fraternities destroy
academic integrity.

Students think the Lexington police are facists, and the
cops think we’re overbearing, spoiled brats.

During the class registration period, the line outside Prof.
Futch’s office is longer than the football field and, the
philosophy department is almost empty.

C-School majors think everyone else is slack. Everyone
else thinks C-School majors are overrated.

The current editorial board of The Ring-tum Phi has been
in place for only three weeks, and we’ve already had to
issue two corrections.

Sound familiar? We hope so. Welcome back to W&L.

Quote of the Week

We go to a private institution, so we don't have all of our
constitutional rights.

— EC President Willard Dumas, valiantly trying to
explain on a recent call-in show why some campus
organizations can be closely regulated by the EC, in seeming
contradiction to the U.S. Constitution.

MY VIEW

By J. Cameron Humphries

The times, indeed, they are a changin’. Who,
for instance, would ever have guessed that The
Ring Tum Phi would ask me to write for them, or
that a republican, God-fearing President could be
soft on a communist. And yet, while the Phi may
have its reservations in asking me to write this
article, it seems that George Bush has no
reservations whatsoever in embracing that
un—conirnie communist, Mikhail Gorbachev.

Mikhail Gorbachev, or Mickey (Mickey
Mouse?) for short, has become the most ironic of
world leaders - almost every claim or promise
he has made serves as little more than an ironic
reminder of communism’s breakdown. Not long
ago Gorbachev stated that the communists would
never relinquish their monopoly of power in the
U.S.S.R., today Article Six of their constitution
has been abolished. He firmly asserted that
German reunification was “not part of the
historical agenda”; it is now historical reality.
And Gorbachev once rejected the idea of the
united Germany joining NATO; the Soviets now
say that Europe will be much safer with Germany
inside NATO instead of outside it. Oh, the times
they are changing, and very quickly.

But more than the old Bob Dylan song, the
current events in Europe and the Soviet Union
invite comparison with the events occurring in
France two hundred years earlier. At this time a
young leader, whose distinguishing characteristic

~was not a spot on his head, but his shortness in
height, was all the rave among the liberals in
Europe. That liberal among liberals, Ludwig van

Beethoven, even composed a symphony in his
honor. All of Europe hoped that the revolution
would establish the freedoms France’s and
England's philosophers had espoused. And all of
Europe looked to Napoleon to extend them across
the continent. Were Time magazine in print in
1799, Napoleon Bonaparte (not George
Washington or Benjamin Franklin) most likely
would have been their Man of the Century.

Gorbachev’s centralization
of power remains largely
ignored...WhiIe in the United
States, our Congress is
planning to dismantle the
world’s most powerful
armed forces (our own).

Yet he did not remain in the liberals‘ favor for
long. He centralized power under his authority,
then marched his formidable army east to
Moscow. Though he did codify laws and remove

MY VIEW
By John P. Roche

To say there are more Marxists at
an armual meeting of the American
Sociological Association than there
are now is Eastern Europe is merely
to utter a truism. But the closer you
look at the views of these self-styled
American radicals, the more you have
to wonder about two crucial ques-
tions. First, what precisely do they
mean when they call themselves
“Marxists?” Second, what has led
them to worship at the shrine of a
minor 19th century social and eco-
nomic thinker?

When I was young in the late
1930's and first entered rhetorical
combat with the Marxists, one thing
could surely be said: these characters
had read Marx and read him closely.
Nevertheless, they disagreed about
most things. There was a basic con-
sensus about one item however: Marx
(as Engels put it in 1833 while

Curbing speech to fight racism

speaking at Marx’s grave) was the
Charles Darwin of social science, the
man who had discovered the funda-
mental laws of historical change.

These laws doomed the capitalist
to destruction as inexorably as
Darwin’s “survival of the fittest”
prescription doomed the dinosaurs.
This vision was not based on person-
al animosity — after all, Marx and
Engels had nothing but praise for the
capitalist mission in the Manifesto -
— but rather on a belief that history
was a script in five acts which hu-
man decisions could in no way alter
or rewrite.

The contemporary Marxists who
are ensconced in the faculties of all
the major universities in the country
are anything but clinicians. Indeed my
experience suggests that their knowl-
edge of Marx’s career and writings is
virtually nonexistent. For example,
they seem to think that Marx was a
great force in his time for social
justice, when in fact he was practical-
ly unknown except among German
radicals. John Stuart Mill, the great

political economist who was a con-
temporary, _does not once refer to
Marx in his enormous body of writ-
ings, including all his letters.

What then do today’s radicals
mean when they call themselves
Marxists. Most of all, they mean to
express their dissatisfaction with the
status quo, finding any status quo
heartless. The fact that this has little
or nothing to do with what Marx
actually believed does not seem to
pose a problem. That Marx admired
what has come to be lmown as “cul-
tural genocide” and looked forward
to Westemizing the natives has been
all but forgotten. Marxism has be-
come the repository of all ill-feeling
about contemporary society.

This leads to my second question:
if Marxists today do not study or
even understand the life or teachings
of the god, why is it that they call
themselves Marxists? Here I think the
answer is quite simple. American
radicals in the academy are for vari-
ous reasons anti-American and they
think, quite naively, that the specter

of Marxism haunts the “American
Establishment.” Over the years, theréi
has been a lot of fiery “anti-Marx-
ist” rhetoric that could provide evi-
dence for this view. But today, thq
average American business is more_
terrified by the Internal Revenue‘
Service than he is by the threat of‘
workers’ revolution.

The “good news” is that mosh
American academicians are non—politi}
cal. Only a small minority are activ-
ists. The vast majority are inert, not;
because they are scared, but because
they find academic politics a waste of;
time. Thus, while administrators be-
gins their ritualistic preemptive capit—’
ulation to some noisy activist just as
soon as the first blank round is fired,‘
the bulk of American professors‘
unfortunately say: “To hell with it -

— let the dean deal with thosel ..

clowns. ’ ’

MY VIEW
By John Zipperer

Students returning to school this past fall at the
University of Wisconsin received a disturbing les-
son from their teachers. In response to numerous
incidents of racial misconduct in recent years, the
university administration instituted a ban on speech
that “created a hostile environment” for other stu-
dents. The administration claimed that racism had
grown to such proportions that it demanded
immediate and drastic action — even if this in-
volved the extraordinary step of restricting speech.
Interestingly, in the first semester in which the
university was armed with such a strong weapon
against racism, UW officials failed to use it.
Unfortunately for the school, however, the mere
presence of a rule banning racially offensive

speech creates “a hostile environment” for the
teachers and students within it, and ultimately
makes the problem of racism worse.

Attempting to deal with the problem of racism
on our college campuses by restricting free sp-
eech is destined to fail: most of what we value
will be destroyed in the process, while racism will
inevitably survive. And yet at the Universities of
Pennsylvania, Berkeley, and Michigan, adminis-
trators have adopted bans on racial speech simi-
lar to the one in place at Wisconsin —— and many
other colleges and universities are considering
adopting such rules soon.

Almost uniformly these rules prohibit students
from making derogatory comments about another
student's race. While rules also ban insults based
on a person’s age, sex, religion, sexual orien-
tation, handicap, and veteran status, the rules’
main focus is racism. Penalties for violation in-
clude a reprimand, “sensitivity reeducation," and

‘From the W&L News Ofﬁce

‘ Scientists from the United States
,,and the Soviet Union will gather on
the campus of Washington and Lee
Yin June to discuss environmental
‘conservation for the 1990s.

The conference, sponsored by the
OU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, will
,be held June 17-22.

' “Since the signing of the U.S. -
4USSR Agreement on Cooperation in
Environmental Protection in 1972, the
Department of the Interior has es-
ttablished and maintained active pro-
fessional relationships with its count-
lerpart ministries in the Soviet
-.,Union,” said Steven G. Kohl, USSR
program coordinator for the U.S. Fish
“and Wildlife service.
. “As the 1990s begin, the two

sides have decided to take stock of
ongoing activities and deﬁne their
joint conservation priorities for the
coming decade.

“The goal of this conference is
to bring together young scientists
from each country who are likely to
play a leading role in the forrnula-
tion and implementation of conser-
vation policy in the 21st century.”

Approximately 40 scientists from
each country are expected to par-
ticipate in the week-long conference.
It is expected that William Riley,
head of the Environmental Protection
Agency, and other U.S. and Soviet
ofﬁcials will participate.

The participants will arrive in
Lexington on Saturday, June 16. A
banquet and keynote speaker will
highlight Sunday everiing’s activities.

The working sessions of the con-

ference will begin on Monday and
continue through Friday. Each day
will include plenary sessions and
general discussions, followed by
evening activities, such as lectures,
slide shows, and panel discussions.

The conference will conclude on
Friday with a final plenary session
on recommendations by the confer-
ence participants and a news confer-
ence.

“The agreement in 1972 between
the two countries led to the creation
of joint conservation projects in the
areas of rare and endangered species
of fauna and ﬂora, migratory birds,
marine mammals and fish husbandry
that have contributed signiﬁcantly to
the protection and management of
shared wildlife resources,” Kohl said.

“It is our hope that the evolving
process of perestroika in the Soviet

Union, combined with this con-
ference, will bring unprecedented
opportunities for American and So-
viet scientists to travel and work
together in some of the most remote
regions of both countries,” he said.

Among the topics scheduled to be
discussed at the conference are con-
servation research and management in
the U.S. and the USSR in 1990;
balancing resource development with
conservation needs; and conservation
planning for the twenty—ﬁrst century.

The ﬁnal plenary session will be
devoted to recommendation for fu-
ture cooperation in conservation re-
search and management.

Conference participants will be
housed in Gaines Hall. The plenary
sessions and other events will take
place at various locations across the
campus.

environment that limits the material

thus face the danger of producing a
generation of students who are so
poorly educated about history that
they threaten to repeat its worst

in its most fertile soil, the racial
speech rules spreading across Amer-
ican campuses will prove worse
than ineffectual; they will prove
counterproductive.

Using universities to restrict free
speech is a sad reflection of our
times. Universities act as the care-
takers of our society, transmitting
and, we hope, improving our values
from generation to generation. IN
attempting to deal with racism by
expelling students who say things
construed to be racist, the current
generation of academic leaders are
forsaking one of the most important
roles of the university. By their
punishment, they force those who

may be racists to clam up, and thu-
take them out of the discussions in
which their racist beliefs might be
challenged and changed by other
students.

Curbing racist speech on our

college campuses does not solve the
problem of racism, it only hides it.
History, while it is still allowed to
be taught, should teach us that
burying our heads in the sand
proves ineffective in making prob-
lems disappear.

Waiter uses Heimlich,
saves choking student

By Brian Root
Editor

Washington and Lee junior
Courtney Payne was saved from
choking to death by a student em-
ployee in the General Headquarters
Monday night.

“I was just sitting there," Payne
said. “Suddenly, a piece of food got
stuck in my throat. I couldn't breathe
or talk.

“It was weird. It was like I saw
everything in slow motion," Payne
said. “Then, I saw Jeff come sprint-
ing around the bar to help me.”

Jeff Rogers, a junior and a waiter
at GHQ, applied the Heimlich
Maneuver to Payne, and dislodged the
food from her throat.

“I think Jeff deserves a lot of
recognition,” said Payne.

Payne said she was surprised that
Rogers was the only GHQ employee
who knew the Heimlich Maneuver.

“In New Jersey and some other

states I know it’s a state law that
restaurant staff have to know it," she
said. “At least, anyone who manages
a place show know what to do.”

According to W&L Food Service
Manager Gerald Darrell, Virginia
does not require that all restaurant
personnel have such training.

“Even though it’s not mandatory,
we have training sessions on the
Heimlich Maneuver for all Evans
Dining Hall staff,” he said. “It's our
mistake that we’ve never done it for
our employees in the Pit. We're
going to make it mandatory there
from now on.”

Although the staff in the GHQ
and the snack bar have not been
trained, Darrell said, each place has
signs that show how to perform the
maneuver.

Darrell said Rogers had not been
trained in the Heimlich Maneuver by-
W&L and that “he just happened to
know what to do.”

“He’s my hero, if he's not any-
one else’s,” Payne said.

Comer trial set for July

By Genlenne Mongno
Staff Reporter

The trial of former Washington
and Lee student Charles “Blake"
Comer, who has been charged with
the March 1989 hit-and-run death of
W&L student Mary Ashley Scar-
borough, is set to begin on July 25.

Comer, 22, faces charges of hit-
and-run and involuntary manslaughter.
If convicted on both counts he could
face up to 15 years in prison.

Police arrested Comer in Novem-
ber after receiving a tip from an
unidentified W&L graduate. The tip
led police to Comer's home in
Greenville, S.C. where they located
the car involved in the accident.

In his statement, Comer told po-
lice he was driving the car, his moth-
er’s 1986 Honda Accord, when it hit
Scarborough on March 16.

He said he was driving east on
Washington Street toward McDon-
ald’s when Scarborough “stumbled in

Atkins proposed that the amend-
ment say that while a fraternity is on
social probation, the members simply
lose their social privileges. This
would ban members from attending
other fraternity parties, sorority func-
tions or private parties.

“I think you need to decide
whether or not you’re willing to
punish yourselves,” said Atkins.

Some fraternity representatives at
the meeting spoke out saying that a
social probation that restricts parties
at the house is tough as it is.

Brooks Pettus, president of Phi
Kapp, said “Sure, you can party at
other peoples house, but that's not as
much fun. You still like to party at
your own house."

Atkins said that by requesting the
SAC to approve the amendment, the
IFC was asking them to decide
“whether it’s possible to flog some-
one to death with a powder puff in
four years.”

The arnezidment as passed by the
IFC must be approved by the SAC
and then reaffirmed by a second vote
of the IFC.

Lewis Tuesday night reiterated his
call last week for fraternities to con-
trol any rowdy alurnni this weekend.

“We [Kapppa Sigma] are even
thinking of hiring security to monitor
our house," he said.

Atkins agreed with Lewis, saying,
“You shouldn’t have to stand there
as an 18 or 20 year old, and tell

someone 27 or even 50 years-old to
grow up. It's absurd for you to have
to tell people who should know bet-
ter.”

Lewis praised the fraternities for
their conduct this past weekend.

“You all did great with shutting
down your parties and not getting any
noise violations,” he said.

After the regular meeting, rep-
resentatives from the five red square
houses and Sigma Alpha Epsilon met
with Lewis and Atkins to discuss
plans for where to hold their rush
activities.

For Open Houses and Rush Dates,
the six houses agreed to a lottery
system for assigning places. Only
four places have been reserved by the
IFC so far - Fairfax Lounge, the
Alumni House, the GHQ garneroom,
and room 109 of the university cen-
ter. The representative from Phi
Kapp said that his house would be
willing to use the “Munster house”
on Nelson street if they needed to.

The representatives agreed that
each house should be assigned one of
these areas for all of it’s open houses
and rush dates. They felt that while
rotating room assignments would be
more fair since some areas were nicer
than others, it would be better to be
consistent so that freshmen could
more easily distinguish between the
fratemities.‘

Vice-President Michael Skarda.

For the Friday and Saturday band
parties during rush, the representa-
tives agreed to a modified lottery

served Zollman’s Pavilion for Sep-
tember 22, and Phi Kapp had already
reserved the Dell for all of rush.

Phi Delt will be allowed to keep
the reservation at Zollman’s in ex-
change for its willingness to bow out
of the lottery and use its country
house, “Bear Farm”, for one of the
other party nights.

Phi Kapp will be allowed to keep
its reservation for the Dell for only
one of the nights; the other reserva-
tions will be thrown onto the lottery.

The representative from Sigma
Alpha Epsilon said that his house
would be willing to have some of
their parties at their country house,

Grads to join

staff in

From Staff Reports

Three graduates from the class of
1990 will be turning the tables and
joining Washington and Lee's ad-
ministration next year.

Shawn Copeland and Nancy Hick-
am will work as admissions coun-
selors and Joel Smith will be an
alumni staff associate starting July 2.

“I see this job as an attractive
and rare opportunity for me to play a
role in a very important aspect of the
life of the university," Copeland said.

“I’m really looking forward to
being able to work with different
kinds of people every day,” Hickam
said. “I think I’ll like the job."

Each job is only a one-year com-
mitment, but Copeland and Hickam
will have the option of applying for
another year or two.

“I'm not sure exactly what I want
to do, and I thought this would be a
good experience,” Smith said. “I
have some interest in public relations
and this seemed like a good stepping
stone. It’s a good job without the
long-terrn commitment.”

Both Copeland and Smith said
they have no aspirations to move up
in the administration but are open to
possibilities. Hickam said she hopes
to return to W&L after having earned
a doctorate degree.

“At this point, I plan to attend

July

law school after this job,” Copeland
said. “But who knows? A lot can
happen in one or two years.”

While all three said they are
enthused about staying in Lexington
for a fifth year, they also said they
are a little concerned about the social
situation.

“My position as a recent graduate
and employee of the university puts
me in a peculiar social situation,”
Copeland said. “While I’m still
friends with a lot of students, I won’t
be living the typical student life. At
the same time, I won’t be a typical
member of the faculty and staff so-
cial circles.”

“I think it’s going to be really
different next year, because I’m going
to be working here, and as an ad-
ministrator I won’t be able to do the
kinds of things I want to do,” Hick-
am said.

“I guess the only foreseeable
drawback with this job would be
getting bored with Lexington, but I
don't see that happening,” Smith
said. “I enjoy the outdoors and this
is a great place for fishing and
hiking.”

Copeland said, “I’m excited about
spending another year or two in
Lexington. There are a lot of oppor-
tunities that as students we either
pass up or ignore that I'm looking
forward to taking advantage of as a
Lexingtonian. ’ ’

sororities during rush that they did
not wish to be extended them.

Besenfelder said “When DG left,
it almost devastated us.” She also
said the interest group “had to spend
a lot of time getting them to come
back.”

Besenfelder said that right now
the interest group is making plans for
the future. In particular the interest
group looks forward to participation
in DG’s philanthropy, the Delta Gam-
ma Foundation for the Sight Conser-
vation and Aid to the Blind.

She encourages any females who
are interested to meet the interest
group, which meets in The Arlington
Women’s Center on Tuesdays at
7:30.

Beatty said that DG representa-
tives will form a colonization team to
conduct the fall rush and that the
representatives may include alumnae,
national officers, and active members
at one of the seven DG chapters in
Virginia.

Beatty said that although no plans
or goals for the colonization had been
established thus far, she knows there
is support at W&L for DG. Two of
DG’s main concerns are attracting a
competitive number of women and
making its presence at W&L a posi-
tive experience for its new members,
she said.

Beatty cited that concern as a
reason for delaying its colonization
until fall. “The numbers just were

not there,” she said of their winter
attempt. She cited one of their big-
gest problems at the time as an over-
estimation of the females who would
be willing to hold out for a new
group by Panhellenic. She was quick
to add that the circumstances were
out of their control.

Beatty said DG waited until now
to accept W&L’s invitation to colo-
nize because it had to be sure that
there were enough women interested
and that it would be in the best inter-
est of those women.

“Once they pledge, if the chap-
ter doesn’t make it, they’re out in the
cold. There’s nothing worse than to
make a big splash and it doesn't
work,” she said.

Triathlon challenges athletes 1

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

Thirty-nine entries ran, swam and
biked for charity in the second annual
Kappa Alpha Theta Triathlon, held
Sunday, April 29.

Beginning at 9 a.m., the event
included a run of 3.1 miles, 13 miles
of bicycling, and finally 36 laps in
the gymnasium pool.

The competition included both
individual and team entries.

Randall K. Ellis, '92, won the
men's individual competition with a
time of 1:20:06, and Laura Dodge
’91 led the women with 1:30:56.

“I'm very happy to have won,”
said Ellis.

This year’s triathlon attracted a
more diverse group of athletes, said
the event’s coordinator, senior Heath-
er Logan.

Besides male and female entries
from W&L, there were also several
competitors from VMI and the W&L
Law School.

The winners of the team relay
competition was composed of law
students Josh Van Hulst, Ken
Woodrow, and Chris McCool, ﬁnish-
ing with a combined time of 1:06:-
37.

The triathlon was originated seven
years ago as an exercise for the
ROTC department. Two years ago,
the event was run by Executive Com-
mittee members Tim Phalen and Bill
Gottwalls.

Finally, , Kappa Alpha Theta
adopted the" triathlon as its pledge
project last year.

According to Logan, the triathlon
is a key step in forging the sorority
as a positive and important force on
campus.

the entrance fees and t-shirt sales will
go to Theta’s national philanthropy
project, Court Appointed Special

According to Logan, CASA’s goal
is to aid abused children in the court
system.

Besides Logan, 22 other members
of Kappa Alpha Theta participated in
the event. They worked throughout
the day setting the course up and
seeing that everything went smoothly.
Thetas served in various posts as
safety guards and trail workers.

“I was really honored that Theta
put enough conﬁdence in me to let
me coordinate it,” Logan said. “The
comment that I got from everyone
was that they had a lot of fun, and
that is what it is all about. It is a
very admirable accomplishment.”

Logan said the triathlon will be
held again next spring under the
coordination of junior Susan Reil.

Two weekends ago there was an
event that made its first appearance in
Lexington. As the morning of this
event approached, the sky clouded
and let forth a pounding rain. Yet
this would not stop the participants.
The event could have used more
publicity. Yet this, too, would no.
prevent the sizeable tumout. The
event was a walk-a-tlion called
“Making Strides."
walked for the Rockbridge Cancer

 V Unit of the American Cancer Society
and showed their support for all of

those who have been touched in some
way by cancer.

Cancer. It’s just a word. But
when cancer is mentioned, it arouses
feelings of hope, despair, pain, and

.death. Many have felt the impacts
of this disease. But it's just a word.
A word to be fought, and conquered.

When I spoke to senior Del Clark
about his struggle with cancer, I was
overcome by the sense of tranquility
that he seems to generate. Del is not
a victim of cancer, he is a survivor.

One of his close friends, who has
a similar impression of Del remarked:
“Del is not struggling with cancer,
he has conquered it!"Too often we
associate cancer with death. We are
scared of the word, and the thoughts

it evokes. But there is another side
to cancer stories. There are those
who survive.

Del learned he had cancer in 1988
during his sophomore year. While
playing basketball, a ball hit him in
the head and immediately paralyzed
part of his body. After tests and

‘ examinations, Del’s doctor told him
he had a brain tumor, he had cancer.

Cancer is just a word. A word to
be conquered.

“When I heard my doctor say

I’ cancer, I became really scared," said

Del. “I was struck by the power of
that word. It is not easy to have to

face up to the possibility of your own

death."

Del remembered his first day with
cancer. He cried. He cried all day.
He cried all night. Then, Del over-

looked the word and began his battle.

Del underwent a five hour opera-
tion to remove the tumor on his
brain. This was followed by weeks
of radiation treatment. Through it
all, Del did not give up. He couldn't

can too. You can't give up. You
give up.

“So much sympathy," Del said,
recalling the reactions of others to-
ward his illness. “I hated it. It was
overwhelming. I wanted people to
lcnow that I was all right and needed
their company not their sympathy. I
was going to be O.K."

One source of power for Del
came from his faith in God. Del
said it would have been easy for him
to doubt God in light of his cancer,
but he did not. He realized that if he
wanted to be a survivor, he needed
help.

“I was never alone. That was the
greatest thing. I was never alone,"
he said. “Even when my friends and
family had left, I still had the doctor
upstairs.”

Del graduates this year. His can-
cer can only be found now in memo-
ries.

Cancer is just a word. A word to
be conquered.

George Cunningham is another
amazing man who fought the battle
against cancer and won. He has lived
in Lexington for a very long time.
He is a retired Lexington postal
worker, who loves to run. Maybe
you've seen him running in the mor-
nings.

When I called his house, George's
wife answered the phone.

“I’m sorry,” she said. “He’s out
running and I don't expect him back
for another hour."

I laughed in disbelief and called
back an hour later.

Even though George lost his lar-
ynx to cancer, he jogs almost every
day. He is a man who runs mara-
thons.

“I had an operation in ‘78,” he
recalled. “It was tough because I
had to learn how to speak again.”

When George learned he had
cancer, he quit smoking and took up
jogging. He said his passion for
jogging kept him going.

“I was determined to jog again,"
he said. “I wanted to run in the
Boston Marathon. I had to do it."

George not only ran in the Boston
Marathon, he ran it the same year of
his operation. He runs about 45 to
50 miles a week.

“I'm not special,” said George.
“I just want people with cancer to
know that if I can go through it, they

have to fight.”

Coach “Buck" Leslie

be conquered.

Coach “Buck" Leslie looked
great. He has been coaching the
W&L golf team for some time now
and was diagnosed as having cancer
last January.

“I was playing racquet ball when
I just ran out of steam,” he said. “I
went in for a physical and ended up
staying longer than I expected. After
some tests, the doc came over to talk
with my wife and me. He said I had
the big C. I got so scared that I
broke out into a cold sweat.”

Since being diagnosed, Leslie has
spent almost two months in and out
of the hospital. He said he never got
down on himself and that many peo-
ple have offered him their support.

“You’ve got to keep on keeping
on,” he said. “You make your
peace with the good Lord and do
what you have to do."

Coach Leslie goes for cnacer
treatment once a month, but he is
still running around. If you ever
need someone to talk to, go find
Buck. He’s one of the gentlest peo-
ple I’ve ever met.

Cancer is just a word. A word to
be conquered.

On October 7, 1990, the Making
Strides walk-a-thon will return to
Lexington. I urge you to participate
because cancer patients need your
help. They need your help not to
die, but to survive. Cancer victims
are survivors. The examples live
among us.

Conquer the word, and we all can
win.

Alumni Weekend kicks off

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee commu-
nity will welcome back over 700

' graduates this evening to kick off the

armual Alumni Weekend celebrations,
according to Alurrmi House staffer

~ Betsy Parkins.

Although 700 alumni are regis-
tered to attend the formal reunions
scheduled for the classes of ’40, '45,

I ’50, ’55, ’60, '65, '70, ’75, '80, and
f ’85, Parkins said that usually some
1 reunionists attend without
1 registered with the Alumni office. In
- addition, about 100 alumni from other
 years, especially '89, will probably
3 retum for the affair. Including the
j alumrii’s spouses, Parkins estimated
; that the number of guests is expected
; to surpass 1,000.

having

This number is up from 630 reg-

 istered reunionists last year and 477
I alumni who returned in 1985.

Special attention will be paid to

 the class of 1940, who will celebrate
2_their 50tli anniversary. Many mem-

bers of the class of '40 will be re-
turning, including distinguished W&L
benefactors John Warner and Sidney
Lewis. Warner donated the money

that the University used to build the
Warner Center, which was named
after him. Lewis donated the money
used for the construction of the Law
School, which bears his name.

According to Parkins, a plaque
honoring Lewis and his wife Frances
will be unveiled at a gathering at Lee
Chapel on Saturday morning. The
plaque will probably be placed in
Washington Hall.

Jim Farrar, Associate Alurrini
Director, said, “This reunion week-
end provides the University with a
marvelous opportunity to formally
welcome back its most ardent and
loyal supporters -- the greater alumni
family.”

Farrar believes that alums general-
ly return for two reasons. The first
is to see their old friends either in
their class or on the school's faculty.
The second is to see the campus and
get a feel of W&L today. He said
that besides looking for what has
changed, alumni are just as interested
in what has stayed the same.

The reunion program has been
developing over the past several
years. The program includes four
different panel discussions on various
subjects of current interest in addition
to a host of conferences, presenta-

  Aspects of Love:

The Rlng-tum Phl, May 10, 1990

 

By Carli Flippen
Entertainment Columnist

Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer
of Phantom of the Opera, debuted his
new musical, Aspects of Love, in
London last April. Although the
musical does not open in New York
until later this spring, the recording
of the London cast is already avail-
able in the United States. Judging
from the recording, Aspects of Love
may be Webber’s best musical yet.

Webber’s career has seen almost
constant success since he began pro-
ducing Broadway musicals in the
early seventies, starting with Jesus
Christ Superstar. Other Webber suc-
cesses include Cats, Evita, and most
recently Phantom of the Opera. How-
ever, Aspects of Love could prove to

p be Webber’s most successful and

well-rounded musical. The plot is his
most complex and thought-provoking
since Evita. While the score is full of
lush harmonies and long, ﬂowing
melodies which mark many of
Webber’s best-known songs, it makes
better use of recitative and incorpo-
rates recurring theme better than
earlier musicals.

Aspects of Love differs frorri his
recent musicals in that, with the
exception of three minor production
mirnbers, it is an intimate, scaled-
down musical. Contrasting with Phan-
tom of the Opera and Cats, which
relied on grand production and dazzl-
ing special effects, Aspects of Love
is more modest in size, utilizing a
small chamber orchestra of sixteen
instruments and a chorus of twelve,
with most of the action surrounding
a small cast of six.

The differences between Webber's
last two hits, Cats and Phantom of
the Opera, and his newest musical
include the complexity of the various
plots. While Cats had virtually no
plot, and Phantom was a basic love
triangle, Aspects explores the complex
relationships which develop between
ﬁve of the six main characters.

The show opens with Alex, a 17-
year old boy, and Rose, an actress in
her 20s, falling in love and running
off to the villa of Alex's uncle,
George. However, when George
shows up unexpectedly, Rose falls in
love with him and runs away with
him.

Two years later, Alex is visiting
his uncle and finds Rose there. The
two argue and Alex accidentally
shoots Rose. At this point George
arrives in the apartment. Then, while

Rose is lying near death on the ﬂoor,
Alex, Rose throw Alex out and goes

off to ﬁnd George, who is in venice
with a former girlfriend. Then, while
Alex is abroad with the army, Rose
and George get married and a unique
relationship develops between Rose
and Gulietta, George's former lover.

Act Two begins with Alex retum-
ing from the army after 15 years and
finding Rose a famous actress. The
two meet, and Rose invites him to
visit her and George at their country
villa. Upon arriving, Alex greets
george and meets the couple’s 15-
year old daughter, Jenny. Alex ends
up spending the next two years living
with his uncle’s family. In those two
years, Alex and Jenny fall in love.
While nothing romantic happens
between them, their relationship
causes George great stress and leads
to a fatal heart attack.

At George’s funeral, Alex and
Gulietta meet and immediately be-
come romantically involved. Rose
begs him not to leave her in her
moment of need, refusing to be left
alone in the world. At the end of the
musical, Alex must make the monu-
mental decision of with which woman
to spend the rest of his life, three
women he has declared love to.

The complexity of the plot raises
many questions. Such as, can there
really be a romantic relationship
between Alex and Jenny? Although
she is a child and his cousin, she will
be an adult in only three years and
does love him. Does Rose truly love
Alex at the end of the musical or is

she simply afraid to be alone? There

is even a question concerning who is
the main character in the show. Even
though the ﬁnal choice is Alex's and
the ﬁnal section of the musical cen-
ters on him, why is Rose given the
final aria and why does Ann Crumb,
the actress playing her, receive top
billing?

The music in the show is classic
Webber. The songs make no attempt
to explore new harmonies, metric
conﬁgurations, or tonal relationships,
but that’s not the point. The music is
supposed to be beautiful and immedi-
ately accessible, not for academicians.
In this capacity, the music is a suc-
cess. The long, ﬂowing melodies of
such songs as “Love Changes Every-
thing,” “Anything But Lonely," and

“The First Man you Remember" are
memorable and sure hits. The harmo-
nies are lustful and romantic.

In the past Webber has been ac-

cused of robbing melodies from such
romantics as Puccini. However, I do
not recognize any steals in Aspects of
Love which would be too blatant to
themes recur to draw parallels be-
tween different situations and charac-
ters’ emotions are too numerous to
list. These recitative passages keep
the action ﬂowing.

Aspects of Love is Andrew Lloyd
Webber’s most thoroughly well-
crafted musical yet. Combining an
intelligent, compelling story with a
beautiful score, he has created another
success, most like his greatest yet.

Troubadour Theatre to take final bow

From News Releases

After resounding for ﬁfty-ﬁve
years with the applause of thousands
of capacity audiences, the old Trouba-
dour Theatre will soon take its ﬁnal
bow. At the conclusion of this term,
the Washington and Lee University
Theatre will begin making prepara-
tions to move into the new Lenfest
Center for the Preforrning Arts. As

Sonoklect

By Chris Bray
Staff Reporter

“SONOKLECT” prorriises to
bring eclectic new sounds to W&L
next week.

The festival of new music will
take place at W&L from May 16 to
May 19. Margaret Brouwer, a W&L
music professor and founder of the
festival, says that SONOKLECT will
exhibit the many styles that new
music can take.

Brouwer said she made up the
word “SONOKLECT.” SONO is

 

  

 

actors are busy rehearsing their roles.
The cast for this production includes
Ax Norma.ri as Romeo and Bernadette
Kempton as Juliet. Norman is a
W&L sophomore who last appeared
in the University production of Body
Shop. Kempton, a junior, was a
member of the chorus in Aladdin.

W&L professor George Ray and
local businessman A. W. “Buster”
Lewis will play Capulet and Mon-
tague, the patriarchs of the feuding
families. Pree Ray, a seasoned per-
former of the W&L Theatre, will
appear as Lady Montague.

Senior Christian Eckman has been
cast as Romeo's companion, Mer-
cutio. Eckman has been part of
several W&L productions, including
Arden of Feversham and Aladdin.
Ryan Kull plays Romeo's cousin

Benvolio, and Denise Brainard is
Lady Capulet. Both are W&L sopho-
mores who have appeared in Arden of
Feversham and love is the Best Doc-
tor.

Scott Bell, as Paris, rivals Romeo
for Juliet’s affections. Bell terrorized
audiences as the dentist in the produ-
ction of Little Shop of Horrors.
Mason Pettit, who appeared in Arden
of F eversham and K-2, plays Rome-
o’s adversary Tybalt. Robin McCord,
a newcomer to the University Theat-
re, will play Juliet's nurse.

Other members of the cast in-
clude Mark Doughtery, Mike Dixon,
Tom Oxendine, Justin Walker, Doug
Nelson, Richard I-lrill, Jameson
Leonardi, Rich Cassone, Tom Hooper,
Karen Myers, Tracey Thomblade,
Pete Mullinax, Amy Cheng, Niv

Goldberg, and Sharmon Smith.

The play is under the direction of
Dr. Al Gordon, chairman of the
W&L ﬁne arts department. Tom
Ziegler is designing the set and lig-
hts; Professor J. D. Martinez is chor-
eographing the sword ﬁghts; Gary
Hurniston is providing the technical
direction. Barbara A. Bell, a free
lance costume designer from New
York City, is the Drama Depart-
ment’s resident guest artist this term.
Bell is teaching a design class and
creating the Elizabethan costumes for
the production.

Romeo and Juliet opens May 23,
and will run through May 30, with a
special matinee performance on Satur-
day, May 26. For reservations and
more information call 463-8637.

promises eclectic new sounds

short for sonority, the Italian word
for sound KLECT is an abbreviated
form for eclectic, she said.

“In contemporary music, there are
so many styles to choose from that
the composer can ﬁnd one to suit
him," said Brouwer. “It provides
for little creative constraint, anything
goes.”

The festival will feature talks by
eight accomplished composersof new
music — including Earle Brown,
Frederick Fox and Chinary Ung —
and some of their work.

Eight student composers from

across the country have also been

CRAFTS PLUS, INC.

chosen to have their music played at
SONOKLECT. Among them are two
W&L students — Andrew Wick-
liffe, '90, and Richard Hoover, '93.

The student composers, along with
three other W&L composition stu-
dents — James Elliot, ’93, Shana
Horrigan, '92 and Michael Skarda,
’93 — will meet with the composers
in residence for a series of master
classes.

“In these classes, the composers
in residence will listen to and com-
ment on the student compositions,"
Brouwer said. “This will be a valu-
able experience for the students. It's

important for composers to be lis-
tened to.”

Compositions during the festival
will be performed by some ac-
complished musicians, including violi-
nist Eliot Chapo, former concertrnas-
ter of the New York Philharmonic
and Dallas Symphony Orchestra.

The W&L New Music Ensemble,
who Brouwer said is a group of
outstanding perfomiers, will also
perform at the festival.

SONOKLECT performances will
take place Thursday, Friday and
Saturday nights, beginning at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel.

The Ring-tum Phl, May 10, 1990

Senior attackman Chris Mastrogiovanni beats his defender toward the goal in Saturday's 18-7 win over VMI
on Wilson Field. Mastro scored two goals to run his season total to 38. Staff photo by Chris Leiphart.

’ By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

For one half of play Saturday on

’ Wilson Field, the Third Annual Lee-
* Jackson Lacrosse Classic resembled
I the Second Annual Classic.

But the first half between Virginia
Military Institute and Washington and
Lee was the only part of this year’s_

‘ contest that resembled last year's

game.

After jumping out to a 6-2 lead,
like they did last year, W&L then
allowed a late first half run by VMI
to cut the lead to 6-5 at intermission.
Last season VMI tied the game at 6-
6 at halftime.

Said senior defenseman Mike
Nunan, “We knew going into the

 

game that we were the better team if
we played four quarters. We didn’t
play a good second quarter, and that
scared us a little.”

Unlike last season's thriller that
W&L won 10-9 in overtime on a
goal from then-freshman Wiemi
Douoguih, the Generals took control
early in the third quarter and never
let up.

“We came out in the second half
and got some quick goals, and that
made us feel more comfortable,” said
Nunan.

After an unnecessary roughness
call on VMI’s Pat Poon with 13:01
left in the third quarter, W&L went
on a 9-1 run over the next 22 min-
utes to break the game open. Junior
attackman Mike Moseman lit the fuse
with a quick shot just nine seconds
into the penalty that found its mark.

464-2695

Sophomore Jeff Roberts beat his
man and goalie Matt On with 6:18
left for his third goal of the day, and
senior attaclcrnan Chris Mastro-
giovanni got his first goal with 4:58
left in the third quarter.

When junior midfielder and defen-
sive specialist Andy Guida scored his
first goal of the season with 2:34 left
in the period off a feed from fresh-
man Derek Hutton, VMI took time
out to stop the rally.

Said W&L head coach Jim Stag-
nitta, “Andy has been solid on de-
fense all season long, and we've
always said he can play with the ball
after he gets it into his stick. He and
[junior midfielder] Mike Pardo have
gotten better all year. They are the
unsung heroes. They aren't very
ﬂashy, but they're effective.”

After VMI scored first in the

fourth quarter, senior midfielder Jim
Jones turned up the heat in the Gen-
erals’ oven. Two straight goals in
under a minute rriade it 12-6, and
when Mastrogiovanrii and junior
midfielder Todd Garliss each scored
within a minute the score was 14-6.

When Jones scored his third goal
of the quarter with 4:56 left, the
contest was all but officially over.
W&L got three more goals from its
freshman class of Rhett Hancock,
John Hunter and Jay West to close
out the 18-7 win.

It was the first win by a home
team in the Lee-Jackson Classic and
also the first time that City Manager
Joe King was wrong in picking the
outcome. He picked VMI.

In the first half, W&L was spark-
ed by two goals from Roberts and
one each from Garliss, junior Clark
Wight, Douoguih and Nunan.

Said Nunan, a long-stick defen-
seman, “I wanted to shoot low, but
it went high. But it still counts as my
one and only career goal.”

“With all the hype around town
with the game, we just tried to take
it like any other game,” said Stag-
nitta. “We cut back on practice and
tried to keep our legs fresh. We just
did the things we had to do. Most of
our shots were lay-ups. We had some
penalties, but the defense did a good
job of keeping them in check all day
long."

On the afternoon, twelve different
players scored goals for the Generals,
led by Jones and Roberts with three
each. Garliss and Mastrogiovanni
scored twice. Moseman had a goal
and two assists. Junior Tom Costello
was strong in goal again, making 12
saves while stopping all six of VMI’s
extra-man chances.

“Balance has been the key for us
all year,” said Stagnitta. “We’ve
been getting five people in the scor-
ing column each game. Mastro isn't
scoring like he was earlier because
people are keying more on him,
which helps everyone else. They
don't slide off him, and other players
like Wighty, Jones, Wiemi and Rob-
erts are able to pick up the slack.”

After the win, their sixth in their
last seven games, the Generals, 9-4,
were ranked 11th in the ﬁnal Divi-
sion HI poll after two straight losing
seasons.

Generals embarass VMI in L-J Classic 2

tournament, the players and first year
coach alike are not disappointed.

“We knew we always had lots of
talent, especially on defense," said
Mastrogiovanrii. “At first it was
disappointing, not getting invited, but
now we are realizing that we had a
great season. We felt we had a shot
at the tournament and did everything
we could to get in, and when the
committee took over, we couldn't
control anything."

“We are just now starting to put
it all together,” said Stagnitta. “It
only makes me think, what if we had
had a fall season? Where would we
be now?

“This team has done everything

I've asked from day one. They’ve
worked hard and come to practice
every day, and they were not easy
practices. They put themselves in a
position to get into the playoffs.
People told me before the season that
we wouldn’t win two games -— but
we did. I’d be an idiot to be disap-
point "

“Getting into the tournament

 

 

would have been a great way to
finish the season,” said Nunan. “It 0
was no great disappointment. We still
had a great finish, beating Harnpden-
Sydney for the first time in two years f.
and whipping VMI." ‘,
Although the loss of the seniors
will leave some holes to fill, Stagnitta
is confident that those holes will be
filled. “Roberts, Wiemi, Garliss and 9
Clark Wight all played well at the
end of this year, and they are all
getting better each day.” \
Along with Moseman, the offense
that will return scored 73 goals and

O‘

handed out 59 assists. Costello will 1 1

return after making 153 saves in 12
games. The defense will be led by
junior David Farace and freshman lg
Kirk Olsen, who saw valuable playing
time in his first season.

Said Stagnitta, “We had a great ,
year. If we finish 9-4 any other year,
we make the playoffs. It just so I
happens that this year there were
other teams who had great seasons.

I'd be an idiot to be disappointed * j:

with our season.”

Senior Mike Nunan makes the final approach on the way to a goal in 4
Saturday's Lee-Jackson Lacrosse Classic. Nunan, a four-year starter on
defense, scored the lone goal of his career on the play. Staff photo by \

W&L golf exemplified in coach

By John Laney
Associate Sports Editor

After winning the Old Dominion

‘M Athletic Conference title last week,

the Washington and Lee golf team
has continued to practice every day,

‘ assuming it will compete in the Div-
p ision III national championships.

Although the team must wait until
May 14 to learn if it received a bid
to the championships, which will be
held at Jekyll Island, Ga., May 22-
25, the Generals have good reason to
expect an invitation.

Four teams will be invited from
the South Region. Host Emory and
Methodist appear to have two spots.
Christopher Newport, Lynchburg,
Roanoke and W&L are candidates for
the other two. Winning the ODAC
should go a long way in helping the
Generals.

“I can’t see us not going,” said
sophomore Clay Thomas, the ODAC
Golfer—of-the-Year.

“I feel very strongly We’ll get a
chance to go,” said co-head coach
Mike Piatt. “Only 20 teams are in-
vited nationwide, so just to go is an
honor. We’ll go down there and see

 what happens.

“Our strength this season was our

1 depth. That was the key. In college
._~‘ golf, you count the four top finishers
 in each match. We counted a dif-
j‘; ferent four each match,” Piatt con-
’* tiriued. “We’re fortunate to have so
. many good golfers here. Most teams
_ cnlv have one or two.”

This season’s success is not a
new experience for W&L golf. In 15
years as head coach, E.G. “Buck”
Leslie has lead his teams to an as-

_—} toriishing 139-24-2 record. He has
' coached three teams into the national

championships, two All-Americans,

 six individual ODAC medalists, in-
 cluding this year’s champion, soph-

omore Jay McKnight, and 28 all-
ODAC golfers (Thomas and Mc-
Knight were all-ODAC this season).
Leslie has also been the conference
Coach-of-the-Year in 1977, 1978,
1983 and 1988.

Thomas is the fourth conference
Player-of-the-Year in Leslie"s tenure.

“I'm very pleased with my sea-
son,” Thomas said. “I played real
solid golf all year. I had a lot of
good days.”

Yet, this season has been a new
experience for the Generals. Al-
though the W&L coach was ODAC

,Coach-of-the-Year, his name was not

Leslie.
In late December, Leslie was

 diagnosed as having leukerriia and

was in and out the hospital in Jan-
uary, February and March.
“The type I have is not the

"' worst — it isn't the best, but it’s not

the worst,” Leslie said.

Leslie's six—montli cycle of treat-
ment ends in June and then he goes
for routine checkups.

“Hopefully my condition will be
stabilized in a couple of months,”
Leslie said. “With the doctors and
the Good Lord willing, I'll be back
to my normal workload in the fall.”

When Athletic Director Mike
Walsh approached Leslie for someone
to work with the team, Leslie recom-
mended Piatt, who just finished his
first year as an assistant coach for

W&L’s basketball team. Piatt has
played golf since the age of 12 and
golfed with Leslie last summer, but
he had never coached the game.

“I didn't know what to expect. I
didn’t knowiif‘ it would be for a
week, a month or the whole season,"
Piatt said. “I had to do the budget-
ing and everything, but it’s been a
great experience."

Leslie would talk with Piatt every
day about how the team was playing
and planning the schedule. Leslie also
called the players to congratulate

them when they did well, and when
he could, he would go to matches
and watch the players warm up.

“I was basically an extension of
Buck,” Piatt said. “It’s Buck’s team.
He built the ship and I just tried to
keep it going in the right direction.
I’m just glad I was able to have
helped him out.”

Piatt gave his Coach-of-the-Year
plaque to Leslie, but Leslie returned
it to him. Now there are plans to
have another plaque made for Leslie.

“He [Piatt] did an excellent job. I
wish I had Mike back with me for
next year,” Leslie said, referring to
Piatt's plans to seek other oppor-
tunities in coaching.

“We all got along real well with
Coach Piatt,” Thomas said. “He’s
only a couple of years older than
us.”

“The transition from Leslie to him
wasn't a problem,” said senior co--
captain Ted Fox. “We all felt com-
fortable around Piatt. Everything
worked out for the best.” 1

Fox, who has known Leslie for
four years, described his coach as as
“a1l—around good guy,” while Thom-
as said Leslie was a great inﬂuence
and a great person.

Perhaps Piatt said it best.

“Buck is W&L golf. They don't
come any better than him. He's the
epitome of first class,” he said.

“He's kind of a legend around Rock-
bridge County.”

A native of Rockbridge County,
Leslie was an all-star quarterback at
Lexington High School in the early
1940s, before joining the navy in
World War II. Leslie received six
battle stars during his service as a
gun captain in the Paciﬁc Ocean.

Leslie was graduated from W&L
in 1949 with a degree in politics. As
as undergraduate he was an outstand-
ing pitcher and outfielder for the
baseball team. The team’s annual
most valuable pitcher award is now
named for Leslie.

Leslie became the golf coach in
1975 after the death of Cy Twombly,
who had directed the team since its
start at W&L in 1927. Leslie had
been an assistant to Twombly for 12
seasons.

Leslie, who plays a lot of golf in
the summer and still shoots in the
70s, said the highlights of coaching
golf at W&L have been the team’s
NCAA appearances and the ODAC
charnpionships. —

“But the nicest thing is the young
men that we have to work with,” he
said.

“Actually, I’m an old baseball
player at heart,” Leslie added. “I
once had the chance to be the W&L
baseball coach, but I stuck with golf.
I don't know. You ﬁgure it out.”

Morris, Meadows look to
bring home NCAA titles

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

On Sunday, the NCAA Division
IH men's tennis championships will
begin on the campus of Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania.

Washington and Lee, which fin-
ished 7-7 on the season, was selected
as an alternate but will miss the post
season for the first time in five years.
Despite not going as a team, W&L
will be well represented nonetheless.

When the twelve bids went out
lasg.,Sunday, W&L was selected as an
alternate to go if one team could not
participate. On Monday, an eligibility
question was raised by Washington
College, one of the invited teams,
which would have affected W&L.

Head coach Gary Franke _ex-

plained that one "player from Wash-
ington College unknowingly played in
more matches than the NCAA allows
for one season.

Once this infraction was found,
WC officials immediately declared the
player ineligible and notified the
NCAA. The school appealed success-
fully to have the player's eligibility
reinstated.

Despite not going as a team,
W&L will be represented in both
singles and doubles by the defending
champion. In singles, senior John
Morris will look to become the first
player to win back to back NCAA
Division IH singles titles.

Morris has been ranked No. 1 all
season after winning the title last
season with a 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 win in
‘ ‘H’

the finals. This season, Morris is 18-
5 in singles play and was named Old
Dominion Athletic Conference Player-
of—the-Year for the second straight
year.

“John has adjusted to the pressure
of being No. 1 very well. He has
accepted the fact that every time he
goes out on the court, people are
shooting at him,” said Franke. “If
John plays the way he is capable of
playing, then he can defend his title.
If he plays one bad match, it could
all be over.”

“I know I’m capable of winning
it again. If I'm playing really well
and get some lucky breaks, then I
think I will do it again,” said Morris.
“I’m feeling ll lot of pressure, more
than I thought I would after I won it
last year, but I’m hoping the pressure
will helprne play better. But it’s still
a lot of pressure.”

In doubles, Morris, along with
junior Bill Meadows are ranked 10th
in the nation and will also be par-
ticipating in the individual touma-
ment. Morris teamed with Bobby
Matthews to win the doubles title last
year as well. Morris and Meadows
are currently 16-6 on the season.

“Bill and I have gotten more
comfortable with each other as the
year has gone on," said Morris.
“We’ve improved every match, and
I think we’ve got a definite shot at
winning it all."

Said Franke, “John is a dominant
doubles player, and Bill is a fighter.
If they both are playing as well as
they are able, they could go a long i
way."

FD auditor denies charges

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

Student Activities Board Treas-
urer Kathleen Duwel told Executive
Committee President Willard Dumas
yesterday that she suspects charge
accoimts were opened by the Fancy
Dress Committee in and around Lexi-
ngton, despite an EC order to the
contrary.

Duwel also said she is holding a

number of unpaid bills for FD expen-

ses, which she believes may not be
in line with the FD committee’s
projections at its last EC budget
hearing.

FD Chairman 'Ale’xander ‘Hitz
reported to the EC on March 26 that
FD would yield a surplus

approximately between $1,000 and
$2,000. _ However, Duwel said that
judging by the outstanding bills she
has received, FD will make “very
little or fall under” the breakeven
point.

One SAB member-at-large sub-
stantiated Duwel’s suspicion that
charge accounts were opened to pay
FD expenses.

He said that Hitz and SAB Chair-
man Charles Conklin “all knew about
charging" and allowed it despite the
EC’s order last fall dissolving charge
powers.

“That’s incorrect,” said FD
Auditor John Hamilton. He and
Conklin agree that the week prior to

"FD some last minute purchases were

charged until the business office
could issue a check that Friday.

CRC proposals

given to

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

The Executive Committee decided
Monday night to turn last week’s
Constitutional Revisions Committee
proposals over to next year’s EC.

A referendum on the proposed
amendments cannot be held until next
year, because the Law School is out
of session. For that reason, according
to EC President Willard Dumas, the
EC believed the whole matter would
best be handled next year.

Dumas, also a senior EC repre-
sentative-elect, added that, should
next year’s committee reject any of
the proposals, he would help the Co-
nstitutional Revisions Committee in
an effort to gain the 50 student signa-
tures required to bring an amendment
to referendum.

The proposed amendments con-
cern rules for closed-door meetings,
succession of Big Three officers-

new EC

elect, special elections for vacated
offices, timing of regular elections
and the role, of the Publications Bo-
ard.

The committee’s proposal for a
revitalized University Lectures Com-
mittee, because it was not suggested
as an amendment, has been for-
warded to the faculty and administra-
tion, said Constitutional Revisions
Committee Chairman John Falk. He
said he anticipates a positive respon-
se.

The EC approved $1,000 for the
ﬁlming of a documentary on the 1992
Mock Convention.

Mock Convention Chairman John
Donaldson told the EC that the film,
which would serve as a historical
record and to recruit guests to future
conventions, would cost between
$2,500 and $3,000. Part of that
money, said Donaldson, would come
from income accumulated through the
Hatton W. Surnners Foundation en-
dowment, which was established in

bly due to innocent mistake.

Owner of Lexington Building

she called Atkins some time ago in
an effort to contact a student, but that
the FD committee owes no money.

Berger, as well as Valley Tru-
Value Hardware Owner Gene Hol-
land and an accounting clerk of Wal-
Mart, said that purchases were paid
at the time of purchase by students,
not on charge accounts.

With regard to charging, Dumas
said, “If there was charging done,
contributing in any way to an inac-
curate use of funds, I'm very disap-
pointed.”

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry
Blackmun will speak at Washington
and Lee School of Law graduation,
and Virginia Governor L. Douglas
Wilder will give the commencement
address at the Virginia Military
Institute graduation ceremony this
weekend.

Wilder, who has remained silent
in the debate over possible coeduca-
tion at VMI, will speak Saturday
morning at 10, but the VMI Public
Information Office said that he is not
expected to speak on any “controv-
ersial topics.”

Virginia Attomey-General Mary
Sue Terry, on behalf of the state, has
filed suit against the U.S. Justice
Department in an attempt to maintain
VMI’s current male-only admissions
system. Wilder, however, has not
made a public statement about the
issue.

The Justice Department, after a
lengthy investigation, armounced last
year that it considered VMI’s admis-
sion policy to be unconstitutional.

Wilder, a Democrat and the
grandson of a slave, is the first elec-
ted black governor in U.S.

Wilder narrowly won. the gube-
natorial election over J. Marshall
Coleman last November after both
candidates engaged in heated debate
about the abortion issue. Wilder
served as Lieutenant Governor under
Gerald Baliles.

The Washington and Lee School
of Law will hold its 135th commen-
cement exercises this Sunday at 2:30
p.rri. on the Lee House Lawn.

The topic of Blackrnun's com-
mencement address has not yet been

released.

Blackmun graduated summa cum
laude in mathematics from Harvard
University in 1929. He received his
law degree from Harvard in 1932.

After a working in Minnesota,
Blackmun was appointed to the
United States Court of Appeals by
President Dwight Eisenhower in 1959.

President Richard Nixon nomi-
nated him to the Supreme Court in
1970.

Blackmun was confirmed in May
of that year and will celebrate his
20th anniversary on the bench next
month.

In his career on the Court, Black-
mun has written several noteworthy
opinions, including the opinion for
the Court in the 1973 case Roe v.
Wade, which extended the constitu-
tional right of privacy to include
abortion.

The decision, which has been
contested during both the Reagan and
Bush administrations, has been limit-
ed by recent Supreme Court rulings.

One hundred eleven law students
students are expected to be awarded
juris doctor degrees.

According to Susan Palmer, Asso-
ciate Dean of Law, this years gradu-
ates will sit for bar exams in over 30
states.

The graduation is open to the
Washington and Lee community, and
families of the graduates.

In the event of rain, the ceremony
will be held in the Warner Center.

VMI’s commencement Saturday
morning will be held in Cameron
Hall and admission will be restricted
to ticket holders and families of the
cadets.

VMI expects to confer 107
bachelor of science degrees and 126
bachelor of arts degrees.

Survey results concealed

By Courtney Hall
Staff Reporter

Although results of Washington
and Lee's first survey concerning
sexual abuse have been tabulated, that
information won’t be released to the
student body until the fall, according
to Associate Dean of Students Anne
Schroer-Lamont.

The survey was composed by a
support group for date rape victims
in an effort to field comments and
suggestions from both victims and

non—victirris of sexual abuse or
harassment.
According to Schroer—Larnont,

one-third of W&L’s female students
responded to the" survey, including
one-fifth of the women in the law
school.

Although, according to Schroer-
Lamont, the results are tabulated and
represent a large number of victims
and non-victims, the data will not be
released until next fall, she said.

“It has been decided that new
students coming to campus in the fall
will benefit from the results and a

discussion of the topic among their
peers,” Schroer-Lamont said.

Calling the survey “educational,”
Schroer-Lamont said its results will
show students what options they have
and open up channels to seek help.

She said that it is impossible to
determine whether the problem of
sexual assault is increasing, since this
is the first survey done on the topic,
but she said the survey will be im-
portant in providing a basis of com-
parison for future years.

“We want people to know that
the university is trying to respond in

appropriate and supportive ways,”

said Schroer—Larnont.

According to Schroer-Lamont, a
large number of women expressed
interest through the survey in forming
a Wornen’s Concern Group in the
fall.

The Concern Group will be aimed
at both undergraduate and law stu-
dents, and Schroer—Larnont said she
hopes that anyone interested in orga-
nizing such a group will come to her
now or in the first days of fall.

Schroer-Lamont said that, during
spring break, she and McCloud per-

formed a training program with Cam-
pus Security officers and the Lexing-
ton Police, giving them basic infor-
mation from the survey results, show-
ing them how to assist women stu-
dents and telling them what action to
take if the case of a sexual assault.

If a student does encounter some
form of sexual assault, Schroer-La-
mont said it is crucial that he or she
is aware of the channels to go thr-
ough in order to get help.

Any students who want to file a
complaint of sexual harassment or
assault should see Associate Dean of
Students Anece McCloud and fill out
a complaint form, she said

Complainants may also seek coun-
seling from Schroer-Lamont, the
support group or University Psycholo-
gist Ben Worth, Schroer-Lamont said.

According to Schroer-Lamont,
“When students make a report, re-
gardless of where they start, we guar-
antee a student total control over
what will happen in that case.

“When a person is assaulted they
feel as though they’ve lost control.
Being in charge gives them back their
self-esteem. ’ ’

IFC social pro amendment canned

By Jason Kelley

_ Senior Copy Editor

The Interfratemity Council was
forced to revise a proposed amend-
ment to its by—laws Tuesday night
after the Student Affairs Committee
ruled that the revisions to the social
probation rules the IFC suggested last
week were unacceptable.

The SAC rejected the IFC’s pro-
posal to change the number of frater-
nity members allowed to gather in a
social situation while the fraternity is
on social probation. .

The council had proposed to
change the current limit of 5 mem-
bers to 25 percent of the membership
of the house.

IFC President Goodloe Lewis said
Tuesday night that the SAC had
recommended to him that the coun-
cil adopt an amendment that would
keep the restricted number at five,
but that called for fraternities them-
selves to disciple members who break
social probation rules.

The new amendment would re-
quire individual fraternities to report

the disciplinary actions they have
taken to the IFC, who would then
have the power to enforce more
social probation if they felt the dis-
cipline was not strong enough.

“People are always bitching and
moaning about fraternity autonomy.
This is about as far as you can go,”
Lewis said, encouraging council rep-
resentatives to vote for the measure.

The IFC voted unanimously to
send the proposed amendment to the
SAC for approval. If the SAC ap-
proves the amendment, it will go
back to the IFC for a reaffirrnation
next week.

Representatives from the five Red
Square fraternities and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon met with Lewis and IFC
Vice-President Mike Skarda after the
regular meeting to hold a lottery to
assign areas for those fraternities to
hold rush functions.

Sites for Open Houses, Rush
Dates, and weekend parties during
rush were assigned to the six houses.

Sites for Rush Dates and Open

quarters game room, Fairfax lounge,

 OPINION

W&L’s free press
vs. purse power

And now, another weekly installment of “How can we
make the EC operate more like it’s part of a democracy?”
Last week we talked about a proposed constitutional amend-
ment that better defines “executive session” and would
attempt to pull more EC deliberations out in the open where
they belong. This week we’ll talk about another
Constitutional Revisions Committee proposal that concerns
the EC and student publications vis-ti-vis the Publications
Board.

Under current conditions, students pay a student activities
fee, part of which the EC divvies up during its yearly
allocation of funds between five student publications.
Consequently, the EC acts as the publisher of each
publication — a situation that hardly affords the student
press autonomy.

The EC now has the power to cut off funds to student
publications at any point during the year. It can override any
decision made by their editors. And if that doesn’t serve the
EC’s ends, it can fire the editors.

The CRC proposes to amend the constitution to allow the
Pub Board to act more_ like the “umbrella” committee it
was designed as. The CRC says the “ideal” would be for
the EC each year to give a lump sum to the Pub Board
rather than allocate funds to each publication separately. The
Pub Board would then disperse the funds to each publication
itself.

Since the Pub Board would take ever part of the EC’s
responsibility, one EC member would be allowed to sit on
the Pub Board to “keep matters in check and report back to
the E.C,” but not vote. This, the CRC says, would enable
the Pub Board more “manageability and ﬂexibility of the-
funds allocated to the Board Reserve Fund.”

The proposed amendment to the constitution would
certainly be an improvement, but it would not quite be the
“ideal.” Ideally, students would pay a publications fee at
the beginning of the year that would equal the amount that
the EC currently gives to all publications combined. That
money would go into the Board Reserve Fund for the Pub
Board itself to divide between publications.

Such a plan genuinely would separate the Pub Board

from the EC and let the student body rest assured knowing
that their student press is truly free.

But for now, we’ll take what we can get. If the EC
deems the proposed amendment worthy, it will put it on a
referendum in the fall. We hope it makes it there and we
hope you vote in favor of it.

SAB

MY VIEW
By Jon Sheinberg

As the ﬁscal year ends, the Ex-
ecutive Committee is taking time to
look back on the financial perform-
ance of student organizations.

I'd like to take this time to offer
thanks and congratulations to all the
people who made this year a tremen-
dous success despite tightening belts.

In years past, the student body
accumulated a small surplus each
year, allowing the EC to provide
liberal budgets without too much fear
of an unexpected deﬁcit.

Unfortunately, no one anticipated
a deficit like that accumulated by last
year’s Student Activities Board, and
that safety net, which had summed
some $25,000, went entirely into the
1988-89 SAB money pit.

Censorship is carried too far

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

The time had been coming for
years and there was no stopping it.
Even the thick heat of the August
night couldn’t stop them. They sat
quietly in the small bedroom, look-
ing at one another and listening to
the dull whir of the ,electric fan on
the desk. He could feel the beads of
sweat underneath his shirt dripping
down his back as he moved closer.
The scent of her perfume was strong
and fresh. He touched her shoulder
and pulled her to him in preparation
for the inevitable moment. Their lips
met, but suddenly she moved baclc

“Don't you have to write an
article tonight?”

I stood up from the couch and
moved away from her.

“My God, you're right. I almost
violated the humorist oath of celiba-
cy. Find me some pens and a pad of
yellow legal paper before you leave.”

Now that we’ve eliminated all the

Coming into this year's allocation
process, the EC was faced with about
$190,000 in legitimate budget re-
quests and only $160,000 to allocate.
There was no safety buffer. President
Wilson generously gave upward of
$17,000 from his funds, and the EC
set aside a $10,000 reserve and
$5,000 working reserve.

The student organizations which
brought requests had their own fi-
nancial dilemmas with which to deal.
Calyx, for example, faced increased
costs as well as an increased demand
for books.

The groups trimmed their own re-
quests in every conceivable way
before approaching the EC, often
only to have their requests cut more
before allocation.

The EC instituted many measures
which provided for better supervision
of funds, rriost notably with regard to
the new SAB. The SAB budget was

unnecessary distractions (like the ro-
mance reporter who was obviously
hiding in my bedroom), I can finally
get down to some serious writing. I
hope readers are so satisfied by this
article that they thrust it down on the
table and read it again and again and
again until they get worn out and roll
over and fall asleep.

The subject of today’s article is
censorship, which is currently spread-
ing across the country like the Gigan-
tic African Cockroach epidemic and
approaching Washington D.C., where
the First Amendment is kept in the
Important Document Warehouse.

In technical terms, the First
Amendment means I can take up
valuable newspaper space with raun-
chy, pornographic introductions in-
volving myself and an unidentified
female, and no one (not even my edi-
tor) can stop me. Not only that, but
if my editor does not give me the
best spot on he editorial page and
instead buries me on page 3, then the
American Civil Liberties Union will
lawfully egg his house and fill his
shoes with jello.

gives great budget

broken into seven different accounts,
covering Fancy Dress, supplies and
operations, facilities, Springfest, and
one entertainment budget for each
term. Only the treasurer had access
to SAB money, and charge powers
were dissolved.

These changes to centralize power
and require more attention to proce-
dure made it more difﬁcult at times
for the SAB to operate, but ended in
increased efficiency and a strong
handle on how money was spent,
leaving this year's SAB clearly in the
black.

The spirit of enthusiasm and
responsibility which pervaded the
work of the SAB board members,
however, contributed as much as EC
directives to their success. Those
officers took a dying organization full
of problems and showed that students
could make it on their own.

Such. was the ..message.. the. EC

Therefore, the First Amendment is
good. Without it, true artists might be
censored and, even worse, I'd be re-
quired to write legitimate introduc-
tions concerning the abortion issue or
the possible reunification of East,
West, North and South Germany.

To show support for the First
Amendment, I encourage readers to
call their congressman and ask him
where they can find a good Adult
Video and Book Store.

Of course, I'm only joking.

What an interested reader really
should do is purchase a handgun
from the local pawn shop and gun
down a few of the Tipper Gore-types
who boycotted 7-ll stores for selling
Playboy magazines and banana slur-
pees.

Recently, I read that one of these
censorship groups tried to get “Lit-
tle Red Riding Hood” banned from
some public school district because
Little Red brings her grandmother
some wine (since she also brought
her a fish sandwich, I assume that it
was a white wine) in the basket.

Flag burning: protected

MY VIEW
By Richard Hill

The burning or malicious desecra-
tion of the American Flag is one of
the most morally reprehensible things
that an individual could do. Memo-

‘ries of radicals around the world

destroying the ﬂag in fiery effigy
makes any true-blooded American
clench with rage. Yet, such an act,
however maddening it may be, is the
form of protest that some individuals
choose to take. As such, it must be
protected under the First Amendment

' of the Bill of Rights.

This has always been a difficult
and sensitive issue for conservatives
and liberals alike. As a conservative,
my deeply seated and fervent love for
my country oftentirries forces me into
an emotional response to such an
issue. When the decision in Texas v.
Johnson was released last year, I was
swept along with the emotion, joining
millions of other Americans in decry-
ing the court and calling for a consti-
tutional amendment. But as I look at
the issue a year later, and after much
thought I have come to realize that
those things which we hold so dear
as Americans and in the love for our
country, force us to except such

protest.

This is not an easy thing to do.
Almost everyone has fought or has
relatives who have fought to protect
and preserve the country and the
ideals for which the ﬂag stands.
Many of these people have died.
When a ﬂag passes by in a parade or
when the national anthem is played,
we feel an emotional rush that makes
one proud to be an American.

We, however, often forget or fail
to recognize what it means to be an
American. This country was built on
a longstanding tradition of debate,
discussion and free thought. To be
an American is to afford every indi-
vidual the right to express there opin-
ion, no matter what that opinion
might be.

There seerris to exist a contradic-
tion, when inside the halls of con-
gress legislators freely exchange ideas
- oftentimes condemning the hell out
of rriorn and apple pie - while outside
a few protestors are arrested for
burning an American ﬂag. Last year
the Supreme Court recognized such a
burning as protected under the first
amendrnent’s freedom of speech. On
Monday, May 14 they once again
heard arguments on the issue. This
time, however, its focus was on a
federal law, passed after last years
decision. This law may seem differ-

ent, because it seeks to protect the
integrity of the symbol, but it’s intent
is the same as that of the Texas law
- to prevent the desecration of the
American ﬂag for the purpose of
expression.

In last year’s decision, the Wash-
ington Post noted, Justice Anthony
Kermedy — in his concurring opin-
ion —— said that “...sometimes we
must make decisions that we do not
like. g

 

I have come to
realize that those
things we hold so
dear as Americans...
force us to accept

this protest.

It is poignant but fimdamental that
the ﬂag protect those who hold it in
contempt.” The Post also said that
Justice Harry Blackmun may be in-
clined to go along with the idea of
protecting the integrity of the ﬂag. If
this happens than the law is likely to
stand.

The question is, can patriots say
that they have truly gained a victory.
A statement that banning ﬂag dese-

 
  
      
  
  
   
   
 
   
   
   
  
  
    
  
    
 
 

heard again and again in this year’
final budget hearings. Organizatio
one after the other came forward t
boast of their financial success, de
spite the cutbacks and oppressiv
ﬁscal atmosphere which faced us .
the beginning of the year.

As proud and confident studen ‘
we oppose faculty intervention in ou
financial affairs, but after last year’
deficit many were left with damag

The Spectator
is ‘junk food’

Realizing that many people have many things to say about
the Spectator, my comments will be brief and conﬁned to what
I consider to be that publication’s main vice.

On March 14, at the ODK/MSA panel discussion on
cultural diversity, Dean Kenneth Ruscio asked Spectator Editor
Paul Lagarde if he thought the magazine fostered civility on
the Washington and Lee campus.

Although Lagarde responded affirmatively, I think the
Alumni Weekend edition speaks for itself (nice cover, guys).

I have no problem with stimulating and controversial food
for thought. Indeed, I applaud Prof. Cecil for his excellent
essay on German reuniﬁcation which appears on the maga-
zine’s ﬁnal pages.

I can only hope that future contributors to the Spectator
will note Prof. Cecil’s tact and good taste.

Food for thought — here, here! Intellectual junk food —
no, thank you.

Sincerely,
Shawn Copeland, '90

Magazine article
called a ‘fiasco’

The latest issue of the Washington and Lee Spectator con-
tained several errors that demand immediate correction. A story
by J. Cameron Humphries and Scott McCoy correctly reported
that Washington and Lee recently hired a new professor in the
journalism department. But the sirriilarity between the truth and
what the Spectator reported ends there.

The central error of this fiasco is the Spectator’s asser-
tion that W&L offered the job to a female finalist. Wrong. As
a member of the selection committee, I know first-hand that
we offered a job to only one person — the man we hired. But
that error is only one of the inaccuracies that abound in this
story. Among them:

- the article says we interviewed “twenty to thirty”
candidates after receiving “hundreds” of applications. Wrong.
We interviewed 12 candidates after receiving about 80 appli-
cations.

- the article says we selected six ﬁnalists and brought them
to Lexington in the fall. Wrong. We selected four ﬁnalists and
brought them to Lexington in March.

- the article says a faculty committee and a separate student
committee “submitted an ordered list of their preferences.”
Wrong. There was only one committee, composed of faculty
and students, and that committee never submitted rankings to
anyone.

- the article says all the males on this non-existent student
committee agreed with many of the women on the same
non-existent committee that one male candidate was the best
of the finalists. Well, sort of. I was the only male student on
the selection committee, and I did indeed support the hiring of
the man we eventually did hire. And so did most of the fe-
males on the committee. And so did all of the faculty mem-
bers of the committee. That's why we hired him.

- the article says we offered the job to a woman over a
more-qualiﬁed man. As mentioned earlier, this is complete
fiction. It is true that one of the four finalists, a woman, did
withdraw her application during a visit to Lexington. But at
the time of her visit we had not yet decided on a first choice;
in fact, all four finalists were being considered equally. The
female candidate in question could not have refused an offer,
because we hadri’t made an offer. It was not until after she
withdrew her application that we offered the job to anyone.

Because of this last, most massive error, the entire story
quickly falls apart. The Spectator says we offered “the second
most qualiﬁed person the job” because of “pressure from
Washington Hall to hire more women.” Wrong. The only
pressure we felt to hire a woman (or a black) came from the
group that accredits journalism schools and from our own
recognition of the possible benefits a more diverse faculty
might provide to future students. No one from Washington
Hall ever met with our committee, and we never heard a
single suggestion from the administration that we consider an
applicant's race or gender. We set our own criteria. And, when
we did make our decision, both President John Wilson and
Dean John Elrod endorsed our choice.

The Rlng-tum, Phl, May 17, 1990

LETTERS

The story also contained several other errors worth noting.
For example, the article refers to something called a “Journal-
ism School.” W&L has no such school. There is a journalism
department, which is part of the College of Arts and Sciences.
The article also says W&L has “the oldest undergraduate
journalism department in the “nation.” Wrong. The idea of
journalism education began here, during General Lee’s
presidency, but there was no journalism department until
decades later, well after actual journalism departments had
been established elsewhere. The Spectator also made up the
name of the group that accredits journalism programs. There
is no “Association of Accredited Journalism Schools.” W&L’s
journalism department is accredited by the Accrediting Council
for Education in Journalism and Mass Communications.

{-

Perhaps the Spectator should stick
to ‘insults and tirades and leave the
reporting to someone else.

That this work of fiction could make it into print is
disappointing enough, but what I find even more amazing is
that, even apart from these many errors, the article itself is
self-destructive. Its central claim — namely, that “recent events
demonstrate that affirmative action is currently underrriiriing the
quality of the incoming faculty” — falls to pieces when the
article itself admits that, in the only example cited, the best
candidate was indeed hired. If gender and race considerations
have hurt W&L’s faculty, as this article asserts, where is one
single instance of this sort of darriage?

In short, while the overall appearance of the Spectator has
improved greatly since the magazine's inception, its reporting
in this particular case has reached a new low. Perhaps the
Spectator should stick to insults and tirades and leave the
reporting to someone else. Or perhaps there is another
alternative, one Humphries himself borrowed from Ernest Hern-
ingway in this same issue of the Spectator. “If you don’t
know the truth -- if you can’t write the truth -- don't write.”

Sincerely,
James Lake, ’9O

Spectator story
‘missed the boat’

An open letter to J. Cameron Humphries and Scott McCoy:

I was appalled by the fallacies and misconceptions in the
article “Pride and Prejudice: Affirmative Action at Washington
and Lee,” that appeared in the last edition of the Spectator.
You missed the boat entirely in describing the selection of the
journalism departrnent’s new professor. Your woefully inac-
curate reporting not only gave a false impression of an
important occurrence in the department, but also made a
mockery of your publication’s masthead, which describes the
Spectator as “The W&L Student Journal of Fact and Opin-
ion.”

As the Spectator’s deadline is
not that of a daily, weekly or
monthly publication, -I suggest in
the future you spend more time
collecting the facts and getting
them from the right source.

If you had interviewed an active member of the search
committee instead of a professor who was not actively in-
volved in the selection process, you would have discovered
that the committee selected, as you put it, “the best and

brightest” candidate for the job. The group never offered the-

position to a female candidate but to the one who did meet
your definition of the “best and brightest.”

Clearly, our choice did not depend on the candidate’s
gender or race. While those factors were discussed, the group
believed the top candidate was not only a white male but a
W&L graduate — two strikes against the journalism department
as far as future accreditation is concerned.

If you had gotten the facts straight, you would have
realized that the search committee, of which I was a member,
concerned itself with qualities that would beneﬁt the jour-
nalism department and, most importantly, the student body.

“All the males in this student committee,” which hap-
pened to be one, all ﬁve women as well as the faculty
members agreed that the best interests of the department would
be served with a quality candidate, not one who happens to
wear a dress.

As the Spectator’s deadline is not that of a daily, weekly
or monthly publication, I suggest in the future you spend more
time collecting the facts and getting them from the right
source.

Getting information from a professor who was not a full
member of the search committee is as unprofessional as asking
the mayor of Lexington to explain what the judge decided in
Lexington City Court. Both operate out of City Hall, but that
doesn’t mean they are qualiﬁed to speak for each other.

Good luck with future articles. I have a feeling you're
going to need it.

Sincerely,
Wendy Wolford, ’9O

Spectator staff
regrets errors

It has recently come to the attention of the Washington
and Lee Spectator that the faculty hiring article in the May
1990 issue contains certain inaccuracies. The accreditation
cornrriittee referred to as the “Association of Accredited
Journalism Schools,” actually is the “American Council on
Education in Journalism." The department referred to as the
“Journalism School” is actually the “Department of Jour-
nalism and Communications,” and that the Department of
Journalism and Communications brought four, not six, finalists
which were selected from sixty to eighty candidates instead of,
as we reported, “hundreds.” Of a more important note,
Professor Jennings and Professor MacDonald deny that the
Department of Journalism and Communications rriade more
than one offer for the position, and state that the one job offer
was made to the male candidate who accepted.

We regret the errors; however, it still perplexes us that
Professor Mollenhoff originally indicated to two Spectator
reporters that a less qualiﬁed woman candidate was offered
the position first.

Sincerely,
Marc Short, '92

GHQ employees
correct Phi story:
We know Heimlichi

We, some of the employees of the General Headquarters,
feel the need to respond to Brian Root’s article in last
Thursday's Phi. It is obvious that Brian did not research
enough before writing the article. In it, he quotes Courtney
Payne (not directly) as saying that Jeff [Rogers] is the only
GHQ employee who knows the Heirnlich maneuver, but this
is simply not true.

In fact, there is not one employee who does not know how
to save a choking guest, including both managers.

We all feel that Jeff reacted quickly and well to the
situation, but we also feel the need to set the record straight.
We do not want the GHQ to have such a blot on its record.

In addition, we feel Brian's interview with Mr. Darrell,
without an interview of either Ms. Martin or Mr. Torrence,
was irresponsible journalism.

Mr. Darrell, although the head of the food service, was not
in the Pit at the time of the incident, while both Ms. Martin
and Mr. Torrence were. An interview of either of the two
GHQ managers would have reﬂected the truth of the situation.

Again, we do not wish to denigrate in any way Jeff’s quick
reaction, we merely wish to clear our name.

Sincerely,
Several employees of the GHQ

FLAG

from page 2

As Americans, we have every
right to make a statement saying that
we find ﬂag burning to be reprehen-
sible, distasteful and disgraceful. The
Congress can pass a resolution to that
effect, but do we really want to ques-
tion the validity of our bill of rights
by passing a restriction? Are we
prepared to take the next step and
forbid any conduct which may be
offensive to the integrity of our
coimtry?...buming a copy of the pres-
idential seal, smashing a model of the
Statue of Liberty, hindering the work
of the president by shouting too
loudly outside of the White House...
Where does it end? Do our sensibili-
ties to the flag extend to other "sym—
bols?"

The reason that the protestors
desecrate the flag in particular is that
they know it is so dear. Aren’t we
hindering that belief when we legis-
late its acceptance? The people who
burn a flag are the same ones who
would do so whether it were illegal
or not. Is it worth risking our funda-
mental principles, because of a
handfull of disenchanted radicals?
By making ﬂag desecration illegal,
we are putting too much value on the
act, and these people have in effect
won a victory. They have shown
that they can get under our skin by
their protests. If, on the other hand,
we ignore it or we counter it with a
patriotic protest of our own, holding
our heads high knowing we are mor-
ally on higher ground and recognizing
that what we love so much and what
they hate gives them the right to do
what they do, we have won.

To be against flag
desecreation is to be
patriotic. To be in fa-
vor of making it ille-
gal is un-American.
This is one American
who would vote
against such an
amendment.

William Kuristler is the advocate
for the ﬂag—bumers as he was in the
case of Texas v. Gregory Lee John-
son. For the first time in my life -
and probably the first time ever - I
am inclined to say that I hope he
wins a case and succeeds in having
the law ‘struck down. But the battle
doesn’t end there, it can only get
worse. If the law is struck down, the
only way for Congress to make ﬂag
desecration illegal is by passing a
constitutional amendment. If Congress
succeeds it will have to go to the
states. The individuals in the states
then must decide if this issue war-
rants changing the Constitution. We
must decide if we really want our
Constitution to reﬂect the outcry gen-
erated by a few protesters. That
being the case, we open up the door
for radicals of all shapes to make
statements in any number of ways.
To make such a big deal out of it,
areri’t we giving them the publicity
they want?

To be against flag desecration is
to be patriotic. To be in favor of
making it illegal is un-American.
This is one American who would
vote against such an amendment.

Tara Maitra, ’93, Branchburg,
NJ — “What did they do exactly
this year?”

 

gq. N EWS

By Cathy Loplccolo
Assignment Editor

Expressing his support for reform
and change in the Soviet Union,
Vitaly Gan, father of Washington and
Lee exchange student Max Gan,

‘ spoke Monday night in Northen Aud-
itorium.

Gan, the Washington correspon-
dent for the Communist Party news-

; paper Pravda, expressed both his
 concern and hope for Soviet Pres-
‘ ident Mikhail Gorbechev’s pere-
 stroika, economic reform, and glas-
/ riost, openness.
" Perestroika is not working well
' now in the Soviet Union, according
to Gan, who said his nation is "sick"
*' with internal problems. Gan said
 increases in wages which exceed the
availability of consumer goods are
causing frustration with the system
’ and an unwillingness to work.

“It didr1’t matter in the old days

whether you actually worked or not.

' You were still entitled to your salary
or wage. Even nowadays, they are
not exactly enthusiastic, because you
cannot spend money there,” Gan
said.

Soviet citizens are beginning to
vocalize their unhappiness in demon-

. strations like the one during the tra-
ditional May Day celebration this
year, when protestors demanded that
Gorbechev resign. Gan said that to
satisfy the public, the Soviet govem-

,; ment needs to improve the standard

;of living, a task which is both dif-

.; ﬁcult and impossible to guarantee.

, Gan said old guard "hard-liners"

'; who are opposed to Gorbechev’s

i; reform efforts are using the citizens’

junrest to undermine perestroika and
figlasnost.

4. “In other words, economic crisis

jfeeds forces from the right and the

Aileft, weakening perestroika," Gan

'2 said. “Supporters of Gorbechev un-
Ederstand that the fate of perestroika

first of all depends on the state of
the economy, and that is why it is so
important to get things moving."

Revolution in the Baltic states of
Lithuania and Latvia are increasing
the stress on the Soviet nation, ac-
cording to Gan. Although Gan said
he completely supports the states’ in-
dependence movements and seces-
sion, he said their course of action is
endangering Gorbechev’s entire sys-
tem of reforms.

“Their movement there under-
mines efforts to implement our re-
forms, distracts the attention from the
efforts of our government. In that
sense I do not support them, and
neither do most of our people, " Gan
said.

According to Gan, the Baltic
states should abide by the constitu-
tional procedure for secession, which
would allow for a five year transi-
tion period.

“You cannot write off the 50
years of economic, political and cul-
tural relations overnight. It's just like
when a husband and wife decide they
cannot stand each other any longer.
The ﬁnal word still belongs to the
court of law, because there are pro-
perty questions. You have to decide
the question of who’s going to look
after the kids,” Gan said.

Despite these problems, Gan ex-
pressed optimism for the future of the
Soviet Union and U.S.-Soviet rela-
tions. Gan said Bush should norrnal-
ize trade relations between the two
countries and continue to work with
Gorbechev, especially during the
summit in Washington scheduled to
take place at the end of this month.

“I think the world will be even
more peaceful than even now. That's
why attempts to undercut or under-
mine Gorbechev’s position is so
detrimental, ” Gan said. “If Gor-
bechev fails, everybody will lose,
your country included.”

The end of Communist Party
monopoly and the shift of power

The Ring-tum Phi, May 17. 1990

Correspondent speaks
about Soviet reforms

from the Party to the president are
historical signs of change, Gan said.
In addition, Gan said the July Com-
munist Party Congress, where the
Communist party is to split into sev-
eral factions, will be a landmark in
Soviet political reform.

“The Party, in the old sense, will
never be the same. So everybody is
waiting impatiently for the Congress.
The same thing is true of the Soviet
Union itself. The face of the Soviet
Union will change," Gan said.

Since glasnost, Gan said he feels
more free to express his own views,
although Pravda still advocates Party
ideology. Gan said he feels respon-
sible as a journalist for bringing the
Soviet and American publics closer
together.

“When you know and understand
each other, what I call the coef-
ficient of human sympathy and com-
passion is increasing,” Gan said.

Gan said he is envious of his
colleagues in Moscow who are cover-
ing the revolution, because the Soviet
people have turned inward and are
uninterested in international politics.
However, he said the Soviets are
eager to learn everything about Amer-
ican lifestyles.

“I wish I could do more human
interest stories on life in your coun-
try,” Gan said, recalling a story he
did three years ago about the home-
less in Washington, D.C. “It was
published then, but I doubt it would
be published now. Soviet readers are
tired of negative news about you.
They don't believe me."

Gan said he has gotten used to
the American way of life and that he
loves the city of Washington. How-
ever, he said he still feels dis-
criminated against and his treatment
by Americans depends on relations
between the two superpowers.

“When people you meet daily
stop recognizing your face, when they
stop saying hi to you, well, I feel

lousy,” Gan said. “But that's life.”

 By John Neumann
« Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee men's
and wornen’s track teams sent their
finest performers to last weekend's

. University of Virginia Invitational in

hopes of qualifying them for the
Division HI National Championship
meet.

Men's head coach Norris Aldridge
is hoping to send as many as four
athletes and a relay squad to North
Central College in Napierville, Ill.

Junior Carl Gilbert qualiﬁed for na-

T tionals in the triple jump last month.

Senior Scott Williams tied his
school record of 48.8 seconds in the
4m meters, but came up just short in
his bid to qualify for nationals. He
will need to shave six-tenths of a
second off his time to qualify.

Senior Wes Boyd was even closer
to qualifying as he is only one-tenth
of a second shy from the qualifying
time in the 100 meters. Boyd will
have to run his fastest time this year
to earn a slot at nationals.

Although both Williams and Boyd
are very close to the nationals, they
are not as close as the 4x100 relay
team of senior Tie Sosnowski, Gil-
bert, Williams, and Boyd. The group
is just orie-one hundredth away from
nationals. Aldridge felt that they

might have qualiﬁed last weekend in
Charlottesville, but a troubled hand-
off prevented that.

The ﬁnal chance for the men will
be this Saturday when Aldridge will
bring the hopefuls down to Raleigh,
N.C., to compete in the North Caro-
lina State Invitational. Although
scheduled to compete at the Liberty
Invitational, that contest may be
canceled forcing the team to go to
N.C. State. Aldridge likes the chan-
ces of his men assuming the weather
conditions are good.

Three women also competed for
W&L in Charlottesville, Their perfor-
mance pleased Head Coach Jolm
Tucker.

Junior Sandi Dudley placed third
in the javeliri throw against some
strong Division I competition. She
threw 112 feet, beating ﬁve other
strong . competitors.

Senior Beth Stutzrnarm also fared
well but did not qualify for nationals
either. She ﬁnished 13th in the 100
meter rim with a time of 13.66 sec-
onds.

Senior Sonya Crayton tied her
personal best in the 400 meter rim
with a 64.4 second time.

Although Tucker failed to qualify
anyone for nationals, he is looking
toward next year for Dudley and
others to represent W&L at the na-
tional meet.

The Rlng-tum Phl, May 17, 1990

By John Laney
Associate Sports Editor

Jim Stagnitta is hoping to enjoy a
little peace and quiet.

“This is the first chance I've had
to sit back, settle in and relax," said
Stagnitta, who just ﬁnished his first
season as head coach for the Wash-
ington and Lee men's lacrosse team.
“It’s been a hectic year. The timing
was tough.”

Stagnitta took the reins of the
team on December 1 and within ﬁve
months engineered the most success-
ful tumaround for the lacrosse team
in 20 years.

W&L had won just six garries in
the two seasons before Stagnitta’s
arrival. This year, however, the Gen-
erals posted a 9-4 record with vic-
tories over four top-20 teams, includ-
ing fourth-ranked Franklin and Mar-
shall.

W&L was ranked 11th in Division
H1 in the final regular-seasori United
States Intercollegiate Lacrosse As-
sociation poll and its second—place
ﬁnish in the Old Dorriinion Athletic
Conference equalled the Generals’
best ﬁnish in league play.

For his achievements, Stagnitta
has been named The Ring-tum Phi‘s
Coach—of-the-Year.

“A real spark plug is the best
way to describe him,” said senior
defenseman Reid Campbell of Stag-
nitta. “The team was ready for a
turnaround. The talent was there. He
just gave us that extra bit — he was

 

the glue that brought it all together.” .

“Stagnitta was the whole motivat-
ing force in our tumaroimd,” senior
defenseman Mike Nunan said. “He
came in, laid down the rules, cleaned
the place up and got the whole thing
moving in the right direction.”

“Any coach coming into a new
situation brings a new outlook. Stag-
nitta did all the right things, put
people in the right places and made
us believe in ourselves,” said senior
attackman Chris Mastrogiovanni.

While waiting for a new coach,
the Generals did not have fall prac-
tice this year. When Stagnitta came
to Lexington W&L students were
busy preparing for final exams and
then everyone left campus for Christ-
mas break.

“I thought we'd be okay by start-
ing practice early in January, but we
had a slump in rriidseason because we
were tired and beat up. We peaked
later in the season,” Stagnitta said,
referring to the fact that W&L won
six of its last seven games.

“With fall ball we might have
peaked earlier and Lyrichburg might
not have happened,” he said, speak-
ing of the Generals 7-6 overtime loss
to the Hornets, W&L’s only less to
an uriranked tearri this season. (The
other three loses were to Virginia,
ranked sixth in Division I; Roanoke,

From W&L Sports Information

The Washington and Lee
men's lacrosse team placed four
players on the All-Old Dominion
Athletic Conference team, and
W&L was represented on the first
teams in two other sports as well.

Senior defenseman Reid
Campbell heads the list of Geri-
erals who were named to the All-
ODAC tearri. Campbell becomes
the first defenseman in conference
history to be named all-conference
four years in a row. Joining
Campbell on the squad was se-
nior defensernan Mike Nunan,
who was second on the team in
ground balls with 79.

Senior attackman Chris Mast-
rogiovaririi, who led the team in
scoring with 38 goals and six
assists was selected to the team
for the first time, as was senior
defensive rriidﬁelder Carlos Mil-
lari, who picked up 60 ground
balls.

In women's lacrosse, junior
Shawn Wert and sophomore Mel-
issa Manko were named first team
All-ODAC performers. Wert was
second on the team in scoring and
an integral part of the six game
winning streak that got the Gen-
erals to the ODAC tournament
semifinals. Manko helped bolster
the W&L defense, anchored by
sophomore goalie Erica Ingersoll,
who was named to the second
team.

ranked ninth in Division IH; and
Washington College, ranked second in
Division III.)

“Lynchburg was the low point of
the season. In the long run that kept
us out of the (Division IH) national
toumament," Stagnitta continued.

Stagnitta, however, is upbeat when
viewing the season as it whole.

“It was an excellent season,” he
said. "You couldn't ask for anything
more considering the situation. Our
success wasn't a surprise to me after
we got going and everyone started
‘working in the system.

“I enjoyed seeing the progression
of the team this year. They learned
how to win, have fun and believe in
what they're doing again. The high-
point was watching the last two
weeks and seeing how people had
gotten better. There's no comparison
between the VMI game and January
6,” Stagnitta said, alluding to the
season finale, an 18-7 win over
W&L’s neighboring rival, and the
first day of practice.

The Generals also made dramatic
improvements statistically. In 1989
W&L scored just six goals a game
on 16.5 percent shooting. This sea-
son Stagnitta installed a deliberate
offensive scheme that averaged over
11 goals a game and scored on over
31 percent of its shots.

“I’m big on ball movement and I

believe in taking the best possible
shots," Stagnitta said.

A big reason for the offensive
improvement was Mastrogiovanni,
who scored 38 goals, with a shooting
percentage of 45.8, and had six as-
sists this season. Stagnitta noticed
that Mastrogiovanni moved well off
the ball, moved him from midﬁeld to
the crease and designed the offense
around him.

According to the W&L Sports
Information Office, Stagnitta was
considered by many to have been one
of the country's top Division I assis-
tant lacrosse coaches.

Stagnitta had been at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania as both a
player and coach. He was a three-
year letterman and a starting defen-
seman in his playing days. During his
senior year Penn was ranked third in
the nation.

After graduating from Penn in
1984 with a degree in psychology,
Stagnitta returned to his native Syra-
cuse, NY, and coached at the high
school and junior college levels. He
joined the Penn staff in 1987 as the
only full-tirne assistant.

Stagriitta’s players at W&L offered
nothing but praise for their new
coach.

“He's a great guy," said Mastro-
giovanrii. “He makes you work hard
and feel proud about what you're
doing on the ﬁeld.”

“On and off the ﬁeld everyone

NCAA championship meet

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

For the Washington and Lee golf
team, a wait that began on April 30
has finally ended.

At approximately 11:00 Tuesday
morning, the NCAA called to say
that the Generals were included in the
20-team ﬁeld NCAA Division III golf
championships.

“The wait made us anxious [to
find out]," said head coach Buck
Leslie. “But we just tried to keep
practicing as if we were going to be
included. That's the only thing you
can do [when you don’t lmow]. We
felt like we deserved to go with the
season we had, but you never know
until you're in.”

W&L is 38-6 overall this season,
including victories in two Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference round-
robin tournaments and the Femirn
Invitational. W&L is coming off a
victory at the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championships.

Leslie said that the depth the team
has had throughout the season is the
main reason the team was in a posi-
tion to receive the bid. “The sign of
a good team is depth. We've beaten
some good teams, maybe teams better
than us through the top four, but
teams that we've been better than one
through six. If someone in the top

four has a bad day, someone else has
to pick him up. We've done that all
year, and our scores show that.”

Sophomores Clay Thomas and Jay
McKnight led the team throughout’
the season. Thomas carries an aver-
age round of 78.9 and was ODAC?
Golfercf-the-Year. McKnight finished 
ﬁrst at the ODAC championships to;
earn All-ODAC honors along with;
Thomas. Joining them in Jekyll Island ;
will be classmate Brad Thobum, who ;
was fifth at the ODAC champion-j
ships, and co-captains junior Brian‘
Kopet and senior Ted Fox.

Although a top ten ﬁnish would
be nice, Leslie is not putting any"
pressure on the team to finish any
higher than they do. “For an ODAC
team, anywhere from 12 to 17 is a
good finish. Our best team in 1977
finished seventh, and they were pri-
marily juniors. This team is com-
parable to that team at this stage in’
their development, except that they're
a year younger. We're. just going
down there to play the course hole
by hole and take what we can get."

“This has been a very memorable
season to say the least, and to play in
the NCAA tournament is a great
reward. For the captains, Brian and
Ted, this is a great reward for their
leadership," said Leslie. “Evert if
you don’t play as well as you expect
to, it's still a great experience."

“He was honestly unaware that a
murder would follow the end of the
play.’’

With this line, Passion Play, a
debut murder mystery by a W&L
alumnus, begins a tale of suspense
and terror that takes the reader into
the mind of a psychotic killer rim
amok at a Virginia boarding school.

W. Edward Blain, W&L ’74, has
published a well-received novel that
other prominent authors have called
“highly original” and “inventive."

Blain visited campus for Alumni
Weekend and held a book—signing in
the W&L Bookstore.

Blain is the chairman of the en-
glish department at the Woodberry
Forest School, in Madison County,
Va., a school that closely resembles
Montpelier School, the setting for the
novel.

A native of Roanoke, Blain was
member of the Beta Theta Pi fraterni-
ty, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa.

He received his master’s degree in

Va. woman
to speak in

From the W&L News Office

Victoria Bond, music director of
the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra and
artistic director of the Southwest
Virginia Opera, will speak at 4 p.m.
on May 25 in Lee Chapel. The lec-
ture is open to the public.

Bond was voted 1989 “Woman of
the Year” in Virginia. Acclaimed as
one of today's most talented musi-
cians, she has been featured on the
NBC “Today Show,” the ABC
“Weekend Edition,” and “World
Monitor News,” and had been pro-
filed in national magazines and news-
papers.

Her visit to Washington and Lee
is sponsored jointly by the dean of
students office, the music department
and Trident.

Bond was the first woman to
graduate with a doctorate in
orchestral conducting from the Juil-

W&LIFE

English from the University of Vir-
ginia in 1976, and went on to teach
at Berry Academy in Georgia. In
1982, he joined the Woodberry Forest
faculty and became the full-tiine
chairman of the english department in
1987.

The first printing of Passion Play,
8500 copies, sold out quickly, so
quickly that the staff of the W&L
bookstore worried that they would not
receive their copies.

During his book—signing at W&L,
45 copies were sold, a number topped
only by Tom Wolfe during his last
visit to campus, said bookstore ern-
ployees.

Passion Play strings the reader
along a story of sex, violence, pas-
sion and murder. It revolves around
Thomas Boatwright, a sophomore at
Montpelier School, who finds himself
surrounded by a series of murders on
campus.

Blain portrays the thoughts of the
15-year-old well as he illustrates the
problems of adolescense through the
character.

Blain creates a cast of interesting
characters. Benjamin Warden is the

of the year
Lee Chapel

liard School. She was also the first
woman appointed EXXON/Arts En-
dowment Conductor with a major
orchestra (the Pittsburgh Symphony)
and the first woman to receive a
conducting grant from the National
Institute for Music Theatre to work at
the New York City Opera.

At the Juilliard School, Bond
studied under Herbert von Karajan
and Jean Morel.

Bond has received commissions to
write works for the American Ballet,
Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Louis-
ville Stage One, and the Empire’s
State Institute for the Performing
Arts. She has appeared as guest con-
ductor with leading orchestras
throughout the United States and in
Europe and has conducted numerous
premieres of symphonic and operatic
repertoire.

A reception for Bond, women stu-
dents and faculty will be held after
the lecture in the Alumni House.

Alumnus debuts with Passion Play

english department head who must
face a terrﬁle and tragic event. Dan-
iel Famham is the rookie english
teacher and the director of the
scliool’s production of Othello whose
inner passions and demons haunt him.
Patrick McPhee is Boatwn'ght’s
basketball coach with a terrible child-
hood past. Greg Lipscomb is Boat-
wright’s black roommate who must
overcome prejudice by taking the lead
role in Othello. Angus Feriier is the
ominous caretaker of the school gym-
nasium who may hide several secrets.
Carol Lane is the policewoman
who must find out who is killing off
the student body one...by one...by
one.
Blain’s use of third person point
of view works well as the reader can
see into the minds of most of the
characters, but he witholds just
enough to command the reader's
interest until the climactic end.
Blain’s choice of Othello as the
school’s winter play is a corr_irnend-
able subplot. Just as Shakespeare’s
character gives in to his violent pas-
sion, so does the murderer who is
stalking the students at Montpelier.

In addition, Blain shows Boat-
wright and Lipscomb as they become
friends in the face of. racial stero-
types. These two very believable
characters ground the book in reality
with their compassion and humor.

Passion Play is currently available
at the W&L Bookstore.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

PiKA continues reorganization

 
By Brian Root and Andrew Waters
of The Ring-tum Phi’ staff

Washington and Lee’s Pi Kappa
Alpha chapter has been given six
months to reorganize itself, after the

' personal negotiation of W&L Presi-

dait John Wilson with the national
fraternity, according to the newly-
elected house vice—presideni.

“In six months, they (the national
fraternity) will come in and give us a
review and let us know the state of
the house," said Richard Perry. “We
would have lost our charter if Wilson
had not stepped in and negotiated.”

The reorganization of the chapter
has not “progressed as well as was

hoped,” according to the executive
director of the national fraternity.

“It (the reorganization) was not
going like we, the university, or some
members of the chapter thought it
should," said Kevin Virta, PiKA’s
executive director. “We’re just trying
to service a chapter that is not meet-
ing the needs of its members.

As a result of this reorganization,
PiKA elected another group of house
officers Tuesday night, according to
PiKA member John Miller.

After the house's operations were
temporarily halted in January by the
national fraternity, a new group of
officers was appointed, rather then
elected, which led to resentment
among some members.

According to Perry, Wilson asked
that the latest round of elections be
held to better include the house in
the reorganization process.

“Wilson wanted to have the offi-
cers elected,” Perry said. “So that
everyone felt they had played a part
and had inﬂuenced something.”

Virta said the national fraternity is
“working closely with the university
to help the chapter fulﬁll all the
needs of its members.”

Virta said the chapter had “v-
iolated some of the fraternity’s stan-
dards and policies,” which led to the
effort to remake the chapter.

“We are basically a service or-
ganization,” he said “That’s what
we’re trying to do, is service one of

our chapters that needs assistance.”

However, Virta would not say
what standards were judged to have
been broken.

“We believe that this a matter
that is best handled just between us,
the chapter, and the university," he
said.

“We weren't close to PiKA na-
tional standards,” said Perry. “Lots
of things had happened in the past.”

Virta said that it was possible, al-
though not likely, that the W&L
chapter could lose its charter from
the national fraternity, which would
eliminate the chapter from any con-
nection with PiKA’s national.

“Whenever you’re looking at a
chapter that’s not performing up to

Coeducation an issue for courts to decide, Governor says

Virginia Military Institute Superintendent Maj. Gen. John Knapp ation, held last Saturday in Cameron Hall. Wilder delivered the

commencement address. Photo courtesy of the News-Gazette.

By Brian Root
Editor

Virginia Governor L. Douglas Wilder Satur-
day assured the newest graduates of the Virginia
Military Institute that, while he opposes all forms
of discrimination, he will not intervene in the
issue of possible coeducation at the all-male
school.

“Let me put it simply, VMI has been too
good for too long for me to intervene now,” said
Wilder to a crowd of over 3,000 in VMI’s
Cameron Hall Saturday morning.

Wilder, who made his remarks during his
commencement address at VMI, also said in his
speech that he expects both the students and
faculty of VMI to respect and obey any ruling by
the courts.

“My charge to you is to stand prepared to

accept that decision, whatever it may be,” Wilder
said. “To uphold the law you have come to
cherish, and to remain loyal to VMI, whatever its
structure.”

In the speech, Wilder, as he has since the
issue was raised, refused to say whether he
thinks VMI’s admissions policy is discriminatory.

The govemor’s only official stance has been
to say that the matter should be settled by the
courts, although the U.S. Justice Department has
named Wilder in its lawsuit against the state.

Former Governor Gerald Baliles, when the
issue was first raised by the Justice Department,
had threatened to appoint members of the VMI
Board of Visitors who would support coed-
ucation. Wilder, however, told the audience that
he imposed no such litmus test.

“I recently reappointed four members to your
Board of Visitors,” said Wilder. “I asked none
of them about their position on coeducation. I

will ask only that they (future appointees) dis-
charge their responsibilities to the best of their
ability.”

Following Wilder’s remarks, VMI Superinten-
dent Maj. Gen John Knapp said that VMI would
follow any eventual court ruling concerning the
school.

“Govemor Wilder, let me assure you that we
will observe the power of loyalty,” Knapp said.
“You can expect that from VMI men.”

The Justice Department has alleged that the
male-only admissions standard denies women an
equal opportunity to a military-based education. '

In reply, the state has said that other state-
supported schools, such as Virginia Tech, offer
ROTC prograrris that give women equal opportu-
nity, thus allowing the state to fulﬁll its constitu-
tional obligations.

Arguments for the case will be heard in the
U.S. District Court in Roanoke on June 4. '

our standards, removing the chapter's
charter is a possibility,” he said.

“I’m not sure, but I think we
would have eventually lost our char-
ter,” Perry said. _

According to Miller, PiKA’s new
ofﬁcers are Eric Mutz, president,
Richard Perry, vice-president, John
Simonton, treasurer and Darren Brac-
chia, secretary,

Perry and Bracchia were reelected
to their respective positions.

The reorganization began in Jan-
uary, when the national fraternity
suspended all house operations. Sub-
sequently, each of the 62 members of
the house were interviewed by PiKA
officials, including PiKA’s chapter
consultant Scott Russell. Only 30 of

those were invited to rejoin the new
chapter.

The remaining 32 were accorded
“early alumni status,” which prohib-
ited them from entering PiKA proper-
ty for two years.

Since then, said Perry, “16 or
17” members have been let back in
through the appeals process.

“Everyone is committed to saving
the chapter and getting rid of hazing
and vandalism that goes on in the
houses,” said Perry. “Hopefully,
PiKA will be the model for fraterni-
ties in the next year or two.

“We’ve been around for 98
years," Perry said. “We sure want to
be around to celebrate our 100th
anniversary.”

Counselors
raid dorms

Freshman alcohol seized,
‘Gag gift’ draws criticism

By Courtney Hall
Staff Reporter

Freshman dorm rooms were en-
tered and searched for alcohol by five
dorm counselors last Wednesday
night, according to freshmen who
said their rooms were opened without
their permission while they were not
present.

Freshmen were asked to turn over
any alcohol they had in exchange for
being pardoned from serving hours,
the regular consequence of being
found with alcohol in the freshman
dorms.

According to Assistant Dean of
Students Ken Ruscio, the search came
after a lunch discussion at which the
five counselors — Head Dorm Coim-
selor Mary Alice McMorrow, Shawn
Copeland, J. Wayne Burris, John
Durant and Tom Brubaker — ex-
pressed their desire to enforce the
alcohol policy.

Although Ruscio said that it is not
typical for counselors to ask freshmen
whether they have any alcohol, he
also said, “It’s not really a change
but an additional step” to the present
policy. ,

Brubaker said he and the other
dorm counselors covered 85 percent
of the freshman roorris.

The counselors asked freshmen
present at the time of the raid to turn
over any alcohol they had. Some
freshmen who were not present at the
time had their roorris and refrigerators
searched.

Several members of the Executive
Committee voiced concern that dorm
counselors may have used the Honor
System in their search.

“Using the Honor System to take
care of disciplinary matters...is totally
wrong,” said Senior EC Rep. David
Radulovic at Monday night's EC
meeting. ,

Ruscio agreed, but said “to use

that in the context of this evening is
very simplistic.”

Ruscio asserted that if a dorm
counselor has reason to believe a
student has alcohol and asks about it,
a student must respond truthfully.

According to Ruscio, some fresh-
men were upset by the fact that
counselors entered rooms when no
one was there.

Durant said, “Some of the fresh-
men were complaining that we had
no probable cause, but on a Wednes-
day night during spring term, that’s a
probable cause."

Ruscio said that student
complaints were valid. “I will
concede that some of the counselors
went a step too far,” he said.

Counselors are supposed to use
their passkeys to enter locked roorris
only in the case of an emergency, but
Ruscio confirmed, “One counselor
used his passkey twice [Pat evening.”
I The alcohol collected by the coun-
selors was “poured down the drain,”
said Ruscio, although the dorm coun-
selors initially intended it to be their
“gag gift” to outgoing Dean of
Students Lewis John at a reception
later that week.

Ruscio said that when the coun-
selors were confronted with one-half
to two—thirds of the roorris having
alcohol in them, the gift “became
obviously inappropriate.’ ’

EC Vice President-elect Raymond
Welder told the EC that the action

taken by the dorm counselors
“should be equally offensive to this
body.”

Senior EC Rep. John Pringle said,
“It seems like such an oppressive,
authoritarian thing to do with people
raiding roorris and searching refri-
gerators."

When asked how he felt about the
results of the evening, Ruscio replied,
“I feel badly as to what happened
and thsfeelings that resulted, particu-
larly for the counselors involved."

Confetti’s bash
generates profit

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

Trident told the Executive Com-
mittee Monday night that it stands
about $3,000 in the black for this
weekend’s speaker and Confetti’s.

Trident Chairwoman Alicia Hay
reported that with 212 Confetti’s
tickets already sold, revenues total
over $l2,0()0, compared to the proj-
ected expenses of about $9,000.

Trident will cosponsor, with the
Dean of Student’s office, speaker
Victoria Bond, Virginia’s 1989
“Woman of the Year”in Lee Chapel,
tomorrow at 4 p.m.

EC President Willard Dumas read

a letter from Associate Dean of Stu- .

dents Anne Schroer-Lamont to Stu-
dent Activities Board Chaiiman Char-
les Conklin, asking that SAB’s con-
certs on Friday afternoon be resched-
uled so as not to conﬂict with Bond’s
presentation.
SAB scheduled Points or Cash,
_ subdudee I net in the Snncrrnarket

and Left Exit to perform in the pavil-
ion for 45 minutes each, beginning
tomorrow at 3 p.m., according to
Conklin.

Schroer-Lamont’s letter said that
the Interfratemity Council understood
that no other Springfest events were
to be scheduled in conﬂict with
Bond, but leadership of Springfest
was transferred from IFC to SAB
without that understanding.

She asked that Conklin resched-
ule the bands to begin at 5 p.m.

Conklin told the EC that the cost
for lighting if the bands ran after
dark would increase, though he could
not state the precise amount.

Dumas instructed Conklin to meet
with Hay, Schroer-Lamont and Dean
of Students Lewis John to work out
a solution. That meeting had not
taken place as of yesterday.

Dumas also said that he intended
to meet with John in the hopes of
making it unnecessary for students to
obtain a noise permit for Confetti’s.

Last weekend, said Dumas, Lex-

ington police entered the Washington

 

Dean Schroer-Lamont
..upset with Spring Fest scheduling

and Lee campus twice to close soror-
ity parties in response to complaints
from the W&L community. At least
one of those complaints, he added,
came from a student.

He said that Trident intends to
secure a noise permit from the city
for Confetti’s, but regrets setting the
precedent that students need obtain
such permits for parties “in the mid-
dle of the university.

“I think it's really sad that W-
ashington and Lee students would call
in noise violations against other Was-
hington and Lee students,” said Du-
Hill.

 OPINION

 

Tough times for
the Spectator

John Lennon once said (or sang). “mother always told
me there’d be days like these.” We strongly suspect that
to be the current attitude among the staff of the
Washington and Lee Spectator. It’s almost amazing how
one little article can bring out the hostility in readers, isn’t
it guys?

It would be easy to sit back and idly condemn the
Spectator for its truly terrible reporting in the much-
discussed article “Pride and Prejudice” that appeared in
the Alumni Weekend edition. However, since we at The
Ring-tum Phi have been known to occasionally blow a
story, that seems pointless.

Rather, today’s message could be summarized as
“Welcome to the big leagues.” Rightly or wrongly, fairly
or unfairly, when you put out a publication, you take on
an enormous responsibility. The reading public expects
you to do the absolute best job possible in every aspect of
publishing. In the last edition of the Spectator, in their
eagerness to run an eye-catching, thought-provoking story
about faculty hiring, the magazine’s staff let everyone
down.

Because they didn’t take the time to conﬁrm their
information, the credibility of the story, the issue, indeed
of the whole magazine, was damaged.

That’s a shame. Whether you read the magazine or not,
one must admire the staff of the Spectator for simply
being able to publish, without any money from the
university. In one year, they have managed to create one
of the most-read publications on campus. You don’t have
to agree with their political leanings to appreciate their
success.

Congratulations, guys. You’ve accomplished the easy
part. However, the fact that you’re widely read does not
by itself make you a good magazine. After all, somewhere
out there are millions of people who read The National
Enquirer and think that Elvis is living in their basement.

The Spectator now must prove to everyone that it
deserves all the attention it gets. How does it do that? It’s
simple. If the editors want to report news, they need to do
a much better job of getting the facts straight.

One of the most basic rules of reporting is to conﬁrm
information, particularly on a story of the magnitude of
the faculty hiring article. When you run a story of that
importance, you better have information from more than
one source, or you can get in a lot of trouble.

Believe us, we know.

The Phi Awards  

This year, The "Ring-tum Phi will make four presentations
to individuals of the Washington and Lee community. Stacy
Morisson and Gregory Euston, Editors for the ‘89-‘90 year,
chose four outstanding individuals for The Ring-tum Phi

. Awards who are generally unrecognized and have excelled
in their endeavors.

Keith Shillington was chosen for lending a unique
character to the chemistry department and the university.

Jim Stagnitta was chosen for leading the men’s lacrosse
team to its first winning season since 1987. .

Michael Holton was the only current student chosen.
Mike exempliﬁes the student-athlete that Washington and
Lee strives to include.

Todd Smith, ‘83, was a reporter for The Tampa Tribune
until he was murdered earlier-this year in Peru. Smith was
covering the drug trade in Latin America. His award will be
presented to his parents.

MY VIEW
By Jennifer Spreng

"1 am going to talk of controversial things. I
make no apology for t ' ..."
— Ronald Reagan, A Time For Choosing

Quite a few people seemed very pleased about
the most recent issue of the Washington and Lee
Spectator. They seemed pleased not because the
issue was good reading or because they agreed
with the magazine's editorial ideology. No, they
were pleased that some of the stories contained
some factual errors that gave those students “j-
ustification” to blast the magazine and embarrass
its editors.

Those are not emotions about which any of us
ought to feel especially proud. Frankly, to those
who felt that way, I say “for shame!”

It is easy to be a critic. Theatre critics who
haven’t enjoyed a show since Shakespeare are
legendary on almost every city newspaper. Critics
expose everyone else’s weaknesses, but they never
have to reveal their own for scrutiny. They wrap
themselves up in self-satisfaction and blast away at
everyone else’s frailties and insecurities.

or critics miss o

When the first issue of the Spectator was not all
that is could have been and certainly not all they
had hoped, they accepted the criticism quite good-
naturedly and made honest attempts to improve. I
am very certain that 99 percent of their classmates
would have quit right then, but that is because Paul
and Ray are more dynamic and courageous than
most.

Most of the Spectator's critics have probably
never done anything so dynamic or creative in their
whole lives. While .the Spectator staff is out
taking the risks that go along with dynamism and
creativity, its critics are living their lives of quiet
desperation. Most are probably too cowardly to
mold something of their own and set it before the
public at large.

I suspect that the real reason that some in the
student body and faculty are so vocally critical of
the Spectator has very little to do with an inac-
curate interview printed naively as fact in the
Alumni Weekend issue. The real reason lies in
those lonely moments between when we tum out
our lights at night and when we actually fall
asleep. Those are the moments when we can no
longer hide from our true souls with the masks of
rhetoric, bravado and self-righteousness that we
wear during the waking hours. Those are the
moments when we come face to face with our

personal success or failure at living lives that_areb_

true and noble. Those are moments of frightening
honesty.

The “problem” with the Spectator is that it
strips away many of our security blankets. It says

-_ x '_ x}.

many of the things that many of us would rathe,
go unsaid. Though the articles sometimes are t
brazen, contain numerous factual and rhetoric
blunders and carry otherwise thoughtful argument
to their lowest common denominators, I know tha
I certainly cannot help but to admit that man
articles in the magazine ring alarmingly true.

I suspect that the real rea-
son that some in the stud-
ent body and faculty are so
vocally critical of the Spec-
tator has very little to do
with an inaccurate interview
printed naively as fact.

The article which received the most criticisr
in the past issue, “Pride and Prejudice: Affirm:

an alarnring number of errors. What is mos

Student objects
to dorm search

It’s great to see our senior dorm counselors
exercising their appointed authority with such
thoughtful regard for freshmen. I can rest safe
knowing that our ODK-recognized leaders have
resorted to tactics employed by such well-
respected ﬁgures as ABC agents, Lexington’s
Finest, and the SS. Threatening freshmen with
the Honor System is a very classy move indeed.
What a great way to earn the respect of your
peers. I only wonder what other questions asked
by dorm counselors are prefaced by “On your
honor...”?

“...are you a virgin?”

“...were you at that party on your hall last
night?” «
“...did you make fun of me behind my
back?” ”

“...did that girl/guy stay in you room?”

“...were you reading that Playboy before I
used my pass key to barge in?”

“...does your fraternity haze?”

“...have you ever used controlled substan-
ces?”

“...did you perform those hours I gave you
cheerfully and vigorously?”

What a great place Washington and Lee has
become.

Bargain prices
for beating up
flag-burners

I could not help but notice in last week's
edition of your newspaper that Mr. Hill - a self
described conservative, interestingly enough —
wrote that it is unconstitutional to make illegal
the desecration of the United States ﬂag.

O.K., fine; now that the U.S. Constitution and
all the other federal dictates firmly apply to the
states, I suppose that Mr. Hill is correct. But I
urge the states, the best representatives of the
people, to strike back at the colossal power of
Washington, D.C., albeit circuitously. The
federal government no longer allows the states
(isn’t that curious to write considering it was the
states that allowed the feds. to exist in the first
place?) to pass legislation outlawing the destruc-
tion of the federal ﬂag. If that's what the
District of Columbia wants to do, so be it. But
I think it’s time for states to enact a different

LLETTERS

type of law; a law that might put a stop to the
various professional protesters who own just
enough brainpower to articulate their treasonous
thoughts by destroying O1‘ Glory and, at the
same time, sidestepping the supreme power of
the Supreme Court.

I say make the ﬁne for physically assaulting
someone desecrating the United States ﬂag $1,
and $1 only. Then patriotic Americans can show
their love for the U.S. in two ways: by beating
to a pulp any ﬂag burner that may show his ugly
head and, in doing so, donate $1 to state coffers.
I have a feeling that after the bums get their
noses bloodied, they'll think again before setting
fire to the symbol so many Americans died for.

Most Sincerely,
Ray Welder '91

Cartoonist
regrets error

in last drawing

Last week, I drew a cartoon of the Spectator
as Don Quixote. I also included a Klarisman’s
hood. The cartoon was drawn as a reaction to the
article “Pride and Prejudice: Affmnative Action
at Washington and Lee," by J. Cameron Hum-
phries and Scott McCoy. I believe that article is
slanted against minorities and completely mishan-
dles the thorny issue of affirmative action.

However. when I reviewed past articles in the
Spectator (speciﬁcally the interview with Walter
Williams), I realized that this particular story
represents only one end of a spectrum of articles
that have appeared in the magazine.

Therefore, in portraying the Spectator with a
Klansman's hood, my cartoon was inaccurate. I
apologize to anyone I offended with my mistake.

Sincerely,
Woody

Of sophomores
and spectators

While visiting the Washington and Lee carn-
pus during my 30th class reunion, I picked up
and read a copy of a magazine called the
Washington and Lee Spectator. So many fresh-
men were involved in its publication that it
seems ironic to find it so blatantly sophomoric.

Sincerely yours,
Jolm S. Hopewell ’60

Student defends
magazine article
on faculty hiring

After the recent ﬂood of accusations against
and criticisms of the latest issue of the Washing-
ton and Lee Spectator, I feel it necessary to point
out that the focus of the story in question,
“Pride and Prejudice," was not necessarily the
one isolated incident that everyone has foimd
fault with, but rather the general hiring policies
of the university.

The article states that President Wilson
“emphatically expressed his frustration at the
failure of various departments to hire an ap-
propriate nurnber of minority and women faculty
members" on March 6, and Dean Peppers wants
to “work as hard as we can to hire outstanding
women and outstanding minorities.” (I tend to
believe these points, because if they were wrong,
somebody would have corrected them by now.)
Hiring outstanding women and minorities I have
no problem with; in fact, I'm all for it. Hiring
women because they are women and minorities
because they are minorities, though, is racism.
That’s right, racism, against the white male
populaﬁon. For the record. I’m not a racist, and
I am a white male.

This policy of hiring, then, not only at Wash-
ington and Lee but at universities across the
country, quite simply turns my stomach.

In the unlikely case that the school had
applications from two different but identical
candidates, one a white male and one a black or
woman, I have to admit that I would probably,
as most people. choose the black or woman
candidate in an effort to achieve some degree of
demographic diversity. But honestly, how often
does this situation arise? The simple fact is that,
judging from several comments from different
administrators, the school seems to be willing to
sacriﬁce teaching excellence to meet a quota of
culturally diverse faculty. 1 am not saying that
there are no excellent minority or women profes-
SOTS; indeed. the school already employs some. I
am saying, however, that, in the coming decade,
when the administration will have to replace a
large percentage of the faculty, the people doing
tlrehiririgneedtolookforandhireonthebasis
of excellence, without regard to color or gender.
As Dean Peppers says, there are in fact trade-
offs in everything we do. But sacriﬁcing quality
of education at W&L for racism cloaked as affir-
Vmagave action doesn't seem to me to be a fair
tra .

Dorm alcohol raid ignored Constitution

MY VIEW

By J. Cameron Humphries

The right of the people to be secure in their
persons, houses, papers and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not
be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but
upon probable cause, supported by Oath or
ajﬁrrnation, and particularly describing the
place to be searched, and the person or things
to be seized.
— Article IV, The Bill of Rights

When last Wednesday night, May l6,
1990, head dorm counselor, Mary Alice
McMorrow asked me if I had any alcohol I
wished to turn over to her, I thought she was
joking. _

“Sure," I replied, “I bought a case just
last night. Here, take it.”

“No, I'm serious. It's Alcohol Amnesty
Night.”

My entire hall had a good laugh as she
explained that for tonight only, we freshmen

could rid ourselves of our alcohol without
receiving any hours. (I suppose we could
turn over our Bibles as well, but that's
another matter.) However, I should not say
the entire hall laughed or in any way imply
that all living on the hall were present, for a
few minutes later other dorm counselors
started searching empty rooms and Alcohol
Amnesty Night was not so funny anymore.

It was disheartening.

I carmot say that I have ever experienced
any breech of privacy which equalled the
Gestapo—like search and seizure activity which
occurred last Wednesday night. And I say
this although my room was never searched.
I suppose it requires a great deal more
personal strength or substance to look
someone in the eye while you search their
possessions than the dorm counselor who
combed my hall had. But that did not stop
some.

Rooms were searched while people were
sleeping, studying, or heaven knows what
else. But most importantly, rooms were
searched while people were absent -- locked
doors did not prevent this Gestapo from

entering rooms. I can only guess, but I bet
they were an invitation for a search.

And what was the purpose of this raid?
Though the dorm counselors delivered a
wide—range of explanation from merely “I’m
just real sorry” to the more noble goal of
allowing freshman to clear their guilty
consciences, the real motive had absolutely
nothing to do with the welfare of the
freshman class. The senior dorm counselors
were playing a joke.

The following afternoon the University
held a reception honoring Dean John.
Several student groups were invited and each
were asked to present the retiring Dean of
Students a gag gift. “Ha, ha,” certain senior
dorm counselors thought, “we'll raid the
freshman dorms. To hell with the United
States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, or
General Lee’s instructions ending
unannounced searches of the dormitories.”

Or so someone must have thought. I say
someone for I do not in any way mean to
implicate all dorm counselors in this crime, or
even all those in the senior class. Mary
Alice McMorrow, for example, even turned

down my offer to look in my room. This
raid did not even have the support of all
those who conducted it. And none of the
dorm counselors claimed responsibility for
instigating it.

Unfortunately, the
question facing the
Washington and Lee
community is... when
another such student
sponsored violation of
personal liberty will
occur.

When The Ring Tum Phi quoted. EC
President Willard Dumas as stating “We go
to a private institution, so we don't have all
of our constitutional rights,” I admit I did
not take him seriously. Yet, someone here at
Washington and Lee did.

But in a larger sense, Wednesday night's
activities are indicative of an even more

significant change occurring at Washington
and Lee.

As if the current disregard for Lee’s
legacy has not been enough to keep him
perpetually spinning in his grave, the
presumption by certain students that they are
not students, but administrators, signals just
how far Washington and Lee has strayed
from General Lee’s expectation of this
University.

Whatever gave certain senior dorm
counselors the notion that they had the
authority to invade freshman rooms is little
different from the false sense of authority that
caused the EC to close its doors, the
constitutional revisions committee to
recommend a reduction in the accountability
of Publications Board to the BC, or students
in an ad hoc committee to recommend the
establishment of a committee like the CRC.

Unfommately, the question facing the
Washington and Lee community is not only
why the alcohol arrmesty raid occurred, but
when another such student sponsored violation
of personal liberty will occur.

doubt that it does. When we won-
der if our school, about which most
of us care deeply, is doing the right
thing, the Spectator arrives to plant
that seed of doubt, and also to point
out that we have no way of stopping
the world so that we can consider the
options.

The Spectator wants to blast us
from our far too comfortable reverie
of conventional wisdom. We prefer
to sit back, call the Spectator writers
“neofascist pigs” and hope they go
away.

Unfortunately for our peace of
mind, they keep returning. You see,
even if they don't have the God’s
truth, they do genuinely appear to
have a point. That is what we can-
not accept.

The Spectator is that often un-
welcome reminder of the costs of
change at Washington and Lee.
Everytime I want to pretend that
those costs don’t exist, or that change
isn’t really occuring, the Spectator
forces me to accept the reality.

But I can imagine that even those
who favor change," and the destruction

of the uniqueness of the school  '

light of day, are not quite so brave in
the darkness right before the sleeep
hits.

They have the Spectator there to
remind them that they are destroying
a one-of-a-kind form of education so
that others who might value it more
than they, will never have the opor-
tunity to experience it.

The Spectator forces the relativist
to recognize in these lonely moments
that he is inherently closed-rninded,

unable to respect and value the opin- ’

ions of the more absolute.

The Spectator reveals all of our
little intellectual dishonesties, the
protective coverings that we use to
mask the difference between what is
said and what is done.

MY VIEW
By Leslie Lenkowsky

This spring, 59 students at Rutgers University's
Douglass College are participation in a pilot
program, designed to test the feasibility of adding
a community service requirement to the school's
curriculum. Each is working nine hours per week
for a variety of agencies at Rutgers and in the
surrounding community, while also attending a
series of lectures and discussions on citizenship. If
the course proves successful, additional tests will
occur next year. By the 1992-93 academic year, all
of the school's 8,000 undergraduates will be ex-
pected to take part.

Although none has yet been as ambitious as
Rutgers, colleges throughout the U.S. are increas-
ingly encouraging their students to serve as volun-
teers with charities and other civic groups. Many
offer course credit for doing so. The National and

Community Service Act which recently passed the
Senate will likely give these efforts a boost by
creating a $25 million program to foster school
based voluntarisrn.

Far from building altruism and civic responsi-
bility among students, these programs are likely to
have the opposite effect. Such practices may, for
example, tell undergraduates that they should not
donate their time unless they get something in
return. Developing the voluntary spirit depends
upon freely choosing it, not merely exercising it.
Including community service in the college curricu-
lum risks turning it into just another phase of
academic life, like freshman writing class and the
senior thesis, to be endured and then forgotten.

For many years, colleges have increasingly
defined their role as providing all kinds of service
to society. While the results have generally been
beneficial, there have been costs as well. Schools
and faculties have fragmented, missions have
become blurred and undergraduate education has
suffered. Now “community service" is to be added

much time to be volunteers and gain exposure to

have little time for deep and sustained study except
in their college years. And without that sort of
experience, they will have much less to give to
their communities later on, both as citizens and as

 Blackmun: seek ‘moral ambition’

the convenient and the easy way.
You should know what is good and
bad and the difference between good
and bad. You know what is ethical
and unethical and the value of orie’s
good word and good name,"

Blackmun said. “You possess power

now, and people rely on you. Do not
abuse it.”

As lawyers, Blackmun said this
“moral ambition" should be the
students’ goal.

“May we constantly probe what
is right and just and discover that one
of its faces is compassion. Perhaps it
may be our only guide and comfort."

Lexington
proceeds
on car tax

By Fraser Bowen
Stall’ Reporter

The city of Lexington plans to
hire an employee whose primary task
would be to track down student-
owned cars not reported to the city
for personal property taxes.

The city had asked Washington
and Lee to give it a list of students
who owned cars in Lexington. How-
ever, the school refused to do so,
forcing the city to find other ways to
obtain the information. ,

The Lexington City Council has
done just that. The proposed 1990
Lexington city budget includes a
proposal for a new position in the
city’s finance department.

According to Lexington City
Manager Joe King, the new employ-
ee's job will be to assist the conirnis—
sioner of revenue and the city trea-
surer’s office with special projects.

Part of this responsibility will
include finding out who owns auto-
mobiles in Lexington and has not re-
ported them for taxation, said King.

King said the employee would not
be exclusively concerned with finding
student cars, but that task will proba-
bly be his primary responsibility.

People are supposed to report
personal property such as automobiles
to the Department of Revenue, but
when they do not the departrrient may
take steps to find and assess that
property. The assessments for the tax
are mailed out in the late fall.

If the budget proposal passes, the
employee could be hired after the

first of July, when the city’s fiscal
year begins.

This would mean students with
cars in Lexington could be presented
with a tax notice next school year.

Students with cars who live out-
side of the Lexington city limits
would not be taxed under the new
measure.

Senior John Morris and junior Bill
Meadows put together a pair of up-
sets this past weekend to win the
NCAA Division III national doubles
championship at Swarthmore Col-
lege.

It is the second straight NCAA
doubles championship for the Wash-
ington and Lee tennis team and the
third in the school’s history. Morris
and Bobby Matthews won the title
last year and the team of Ben Johns
and Stewart Jackson won the cham-
pionship in 1977.

In Saturday's semifinals, Morris
and Meadows, ranked lltli in the
nation before the toumament and
seeded eighth in the championships,

_ beat top seeds Scott Flippen—Read and

Larry Gewer from Washington Col-
lege 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-3).

“That match ended up being a
better match than the finals to
watch,” said head coach Gary
Franke.

What rriade the win look even
better was the fact that it was Flip-
pen-Read who knocked Morris out of
the singles tournament earlier that
day. Morris was bidding to become

the first player in history to win
back-to-back Division HI singles
titles.

Morris reached the semifinals by
virtue of a 6-0, 3-6, 7-5 win in the
first round followed by three straight
set wins before Flippen—Read, the No.
3 seed, dispatched Morris 6-2, 6-1.

On Sunday afternoon, The W&L
duo defeated third-seeded Scott
Milener and Robert Hession of Roch-
ester College 6-3, 6-4 to win the title.

After five service breaks in the
first set, Morris and Meadows broke
serve to win the championship. “John
and I played the best we had played
all season," said Meadows, a 1989
doubles All-American and W&L’s
1988 Freshman Athlete-of-the-Year.

“In the tournament, we were always.

up and we never had any letdowns.
We seemed to be in control of every
match and we both served and re-
turned well, which is key to doubles
play.”

While Franke acknowledged that
Morris, a three time All-American
and the 1990 Division III Senior
Player-of-tlie-Year, performed well, he
was particularly impressed with the
outstanding play of Meadows.

“Meadows played up to his pot-
ential every time and he needed to do
that for them to be successful,”

Associate Sports Editor

For Washington and Lee’s John
Morris, the 1990 tennis season had a
familiar ending.

In 1988, Morris played on the
team that won the NCAA Division
III national championship, the first
team national championship in any
sport in W&L’s history.

Last year, the senior from Mem-
phis, Tenn., was the NCAA Division
IH singles and doubles national cham-
pion, making him only the third
player to ever win both titles in the
same year.

At the 1990 national champion-
ships, held this past week at Swarth-
more College in Swarthmore, Pa.,
Morris, the No. 1 seed at the tourna-
was honored as the 1990
NCAA Division III Senior Player-of-
the-Year, an award based on voting
by Division III coaches.

On Saturday and Sunday, Morris
and his partner, junior Bill Meadows,
recorded a pair of upsets to win

‘ W&L’s second straight Division III

national doubles championship.

For his achievements, Morris has
been named The Ring-tum Phi’s Ath-
lcte-of-the-Year.

Morris’ three national champion-
ships ties the NCAA record for most
overall titles. Shaun Miller of Gus-
tavus Adolphus won the Division III
singles title in 1982 and doubles titles
in 1981 and 1982. ,

“John has outstanding ability, but

3 more importantly, he has a great

focus and an internal desire to be
successful,” said head coach Gary

    

John Morris

Franke.

“His forte is a really big serve,"
said Meadows of his doubles team-
mate. “When he’s serving well, no-
body can beat him. He’s an aggres-
sive player and he gets to the net a
lot. Once he’s there you’re pretty
much at his mercy.

“Morris is a great doubles player,
too.‘- He’s- been to the doubles-ifmals
three times,” Meadows continued.
“I've learned a lot from him. Playing
with him I ﬁlled the role as a scrap-
per with good enough serves and re-
turns to get some points.”

Morris, who won 20 straight
matches last year and was ranked No.
1 in the nation throughout the season,
was seeded first in last week's na-
tional singles championships, attempt-
ing to become the first player in
NCAA Division HI history to repeat
as men's singles champion.

Even though Morris lost to third-
seeded Scott Flippen—Read of Wash-
ington College 6-2, 6-1, in Saturday’s
semifinal round, neither Franke nor
Morris expressed much disappoint-

 Morris, Meadows win title  

Franke said. “Most teams [at the
championships] tried to exploit Bill
because they lmow how good John is,
but Bill just had great returns and
overhead shots throughout the tourria-
ment.”

“Bill had an amazing tournament.
He deserves a lot of credit," said
Morris, who has played in the nation-
al doubles final three times.

This was the first year that Morris
and Meadows played together. During
the’ previous two seasons Morris
teamed with Matthews while Mea-
dows played with Robert Haley.

“It was a rough start for us and
things looked pretty bleak," Morris
said. “But, we got more and more
comfortable with each other."

“They had some good wins late
in the season. The turning point was
the win at Rollins," said Franke,
referring to the match at the Div-
ision H powerhouse on April 18.
“After that they realized they could
perform real well together and beat
some good teams.” .

It was the first season since 19
that the men’s team did not receive a
bid to the national tournament. The
Generals were ranked 13th and were
an alternate for the team champion-
ships. Twelve teams competed in the
tournament.

...NCAA doubles champion

“We’re happy with the ODAC
titleand ending up with a 7-7 record,
but from a team perspective it was
disappointing to not make to the
national toumament,” said Franke.

“We were one spot away from
getting in. Everybody really wanted
to go,” Morris said. “From what I
saw at the toumament, I thought we
could have hung in with some of the
teams there."

Morris was ranked third in the
final singles rankings, while he and
Meadows were honored with the No.
1 ranking in doubles.

From W&L Sports Information

The Washington and Lee’
4Xl00 relay team, which just
missed qualifying for the NCAA
Championship meet a week ago at
the Cavalier Invitational, qualified
for the meet by a margin of just
three‘-one hundredths of a second.

On Saturday at the Clemson
Invitational, the team of seniors
Wes Boyd, Tie Sosnowski and
Scott Williams along with junior
Carl Gilbert ran a fully automatic
time of 42.31 to come in just
under the qualifying standard.

The team competed in the
NCAA Championships at North
Central College in Napercille, Ill.
along with Gilbert, who qualiﬁed
in the triple jump beginning Wed-
nesday and running through Satur-
day.

This may not be my gripe, but it I'm taking it up anyway. The 1990
All-Old Dominion Athletic Conference nien’s lacrosse team was
armounced last week, and although four Generals were included on the
team, possibly the most deserving of the honor was left out.

Ninth-ranked Roanoke won the conference title by winning all five of
its games. Bill Pilat, an assistant at W&L the last time W&L finished a
season with a winning record, was selected by his peers as Coach-of-
the-Year.

This is my supposition — either his peers are blind, had their eyes
closed when they filled out the Coach-of-the-Year section of their ballots,
or are just plain stupid. Not that Pilat is to blame, but for at least one
obvious choice to be overlooked....

The four Generals, seniors Chris Mastrogiovanni, Carlos Millan, Mike
Nurian and four-tirne selection Reid Campbell were rightly rewarded for
their labors. But the man who put the players on the field and gave them
a structure that allowed them to win nine games against a schedule that
included eight teams ranked nationally in either Divisions I or III was
not.

The coach deserves some credit. In most leagues, a coach who directs
a turnaround of the magnitude that Jim Stagnitta did here at W&L is
rewarded for his work with Coach—of-tlie-Year honors.

Maybe he wasn't the most well liked coach around the country,
especially by officials. He yelled at calls and carried on like a man
possessed on the sideline. First-year coaches aren't supposed to react like
that. They are supposed to take things as they go until they can build
up a reputation.

Well, Jim Stagnitta did what he felt he had to do. He was trying to
turn a program around. To do that, he felt he needed to stick up for his
team when he felt they got a bad call. It may not be proper coaching
etiquette, but it is part of the job. A good coach sticks up for his team
any way he can. « .

It took real guts for the ODAC coaches to select as their Coach-of-
the-Year someone with a pat hand. Roanoke was everyone’s favorite to
win the conference, and they did. That deserves some merit, but Bill Pilat
didri’t do anything special. He had a decent year, and 8-6 is exactly
that — a decent year.

Jim Stagnitta had a great year. He knew nothing about the team, but
he knew what he wanted. He installed a patient, motion offense and a
pressure zone defense. As a result, the team scored 68 more goals than
in 1989 and had more assists (78) in 1990 than the 1989 team had goals
(77). The defense allowed one goal less per game in 1990, and the results
were obvious. -

Not to be overlooked is the job Stewart Moan did at Lynchburg. He
took his team to its best year ever, a year that included the 7-6 overtime
win over W&L that kept the Generals out of the playoffs.

This is not the first time the ODAC has made a blunder in selecting
a Coach-of-the-Year. In the past two years, only nine coaches named
Coach-of-the-Year in their sport coached teams that did not win the
conference championship, and only three this year.

Of the last six main seasons, football, basketball, and lacrosse, only
three of the six coaches who were selected were deserving of the honor.
In 1988, Gary Fallon guided W&L to a 5-3-1 season after starting 0-2-
1. Verne Canfield was honored in basketball after taking a team picked
fifth to a regular season title. In 1989, Randolph-Macon football coach
Jim Blackburn was rewarded after his team won the ODAC title after
being picked to finish last.

The other selections, Harnpden-Sydney lacrosse coach Ray Rostan
(1989), R—MC basketball coach Hal Nurmally and Pilat were safety picks
at best. Nunnally coached a team that finished the 1988-89 season ranked
in Division II. Both Roanoke coach Page Moir and Emory and Henry

 Jolmson did much better jobs than Nunrially did with teams

merit.

“I was a little disappointed, but I
_think I had a really good tour-
nament,” Morris said. “There was
some pressure to repeat and I was
most worried about getting through
the early rounds. I had nine good
matches and one bad one.

“I had a good season before the
tournament, but it was hard for me to
tell where my level of play was

before the championships," he ad-1
ded. “During the season I died not
to look too far ahead.”

Morris, who is trying to get into
medical school and who has played
tennis year-roiind since the age of
seven, said he will continue to play
as much as he can.

- .. that were not as solid as Nuririally's and were clearly more deserving.

Let's face it, tliere’s more to being Coach-of-the-Year than just wirming
conference titles. Rostan doesri’t feel that this year's decision was made
on those grounds, but that it may be the case in other places. “I don't
think anyone voted for Bill simply because his team won the conference.
He had a great year. I also felt Stewart Moan at Lynchburg had a
tremendous year, and Jim at W&L had a great year. I told the committee
that all three were deserving of the honor.”

Said Moan, “I was pleased with the selection. Bill did a good job with ,

his team. I also thought that Jim Stagnitta did a fabulous job, and I'd like
to believe that I did a good job with our team. I’m sure the voting was
very close, and Billy may have won by one vote."

Stagnitta took a program that was a shell of its former self (W&L had
13 straight winning seasons from 1970-1982) that had suffered six losing
seasons in seven years and put it back on the map.

The choice of Jim Stagnitta as Coach-of-the-Year should have been as
plain as the nose on a normal persori’s face. The verdict is in: the ODAC
coaches are just plain stupid.

Lee’s College earns an A+

 

By Todd Peppers
Entertainment Columnist

Warning: this article sets a new
and dubious record for biased
opinions. Instead of remaining in my
little world of movie and restaurant
reviews, I have been given the task
of grading my four years at
Washington and Lee. Some of the
topics I will address span the last
four years, others pertain to a shorter
period of time. So, without further
ado, here is Peppers’ report card. The

I grades are ﬁnal and are not subject to

review.

The Speaking Tradition: Perhaps

; all seniors drone on about their fresh-

man year and bemoan the fact that
the younger students have lost touch
with tradition. I will plead guilty to
this charge, yet I honestly sense a
deﬁnite decline in theiart of greeting
a fellow student or faculty member.
Allow me to explain: when I visited
Washington and Lee in tlie spring of
1985, every young lady greeted my
tour with a dazzling smile and a
friendly hello. Of course I assumed
they were attracted to this Nebraska
farm boy. Then my tour guide ex-
plained the Speaking Tradition, and
my ego quickly deﬂated. Today the
younger generation of W & L student
seems panic—stricken and/or suspicious
when you say “hello.” They might
stare at the cloud formations, or
scrutinize their shoes, but eye contact
is rare. Come on kids, don’t force
us elderly students to revive the evil
Assimilation Committee. University
wide observance of the Speaking
Tradition earns an “B+”; freshman
participation receives a “C-."

Spectator: Where to start? This
delightful piece of political sophistry
has almost shamed me into hiding
my conservative tendencies. Last
week’s Phi demonstrated that I am
not alone in my contempt over this
“intellectual junk-food.” (Great line,
Shawn) Furthermore, this cranky
senior is tired of having a freshman
offer us poor slugs his divine truths.
The end of rational thought--I am too
mortified to reply. And if I read one
more moronic remark about the mid-

western devils that are plaguing the
administration, then this Nebraska
boy, and his Iowan father, are going
to teach the editors of Spectator a
good, old-fashioned, Nebraska football
chop-block. The witty, sophisticated,
and sage Spectator earns a solid
“F.” “Extremism in the defense of
liberty" may not be a vice, but con-
servative hysteria for the sake of
sensationalism is not a virtue.

The Student Activities Board: In
my lifetime I have witnessed the
silliest Fancy Dress Theme (“The
Reconciliation Ball”--about as ftm as
a “My Favorite Martian” Ball),
secret charge accounts, massive debt,
disgruntled letters in the Phi, and
SAB vs. Executive Committee war-
fare. But let's be honest: without
SAB intrigue, the front page of the
Phi would be as fascinating as the
appendix of an economics textbook.
My surprise grade: For pure entertain-
ment value and melodrama, the SAB
earns a solid “A.”

Co-Education at Washington and
Lee: During the last four years I
have, on numerous occasions, heard
W & L gentlemm present eloquent
speeches on the lost glories of
Washington and Lee. Guys, let's
take a reality break. When
Washington and Lee was on the brink
of co—education, we were trying to
get dates to our high school prom.
How can students yearn for a time
period that they never experienced?
How can students pine for an era
when our university was a member of
a dying breed? My class was the
second co—ed class at Washington and
Lee, and I knew gentlemen from the
last two all-male classes. In my
humble opinion, I have perceived a
definite rise in the quality and the
intellectual stamina of our students.
We have regained our former
academic stature in the eyes of the
nation. Let the question of co-educa-
tion disappear into the past, Washing-
ton and Lee tour guides are tired of
convincing prospective students that
we don't hate women. The move to
co~education, which I was not con-
sulted about, receives an “B+.” The
grade will be raised to an “A” when
this school moves to a 50-50 ratio.

The Washington and Lee Faculty:
The next grade is not meant to assure
myself a nifty graduation present. We
are blessed with an outstanding facul-
ty. I have had rough professors,
demanding professors, and eccentric
professors, but I have not had medi-
ocre or average professors. Stop
playing a "prevent defense” with
your G.P.A. and go nose-to-nose with
some legends: Tom Nye in Biology,
Jolm “The Tail Gunner" Gunn in
Economics, Delos “Easy D" Hughes
and John Handelman in Politics,
Severn “Dog” Duvall in English,
Harrison “Pembie” Pernberton and
Charles Boggs in Philosophy, and,
ﬁnally, ole Reverend Hodges in Reli-
gion. You might not get a 4.0 from
these gentlemen, and they will put up
a fierce debate in the classroom, but
they will always pick you up and
dust you off. The Washington and
Lee faculty receive a grade of “A.”

Washington and Lee University:

Graduation is exactly two weeks _
away, and I'm already getting a lump
in my throat. I might sound like an

Admissions Office brochure, but this 4 pm.
place is a treasure. The sense of
tradition, honor, camaraderie, and
scholarship at Washington and Lee
leaves a mark on your so11l--I may be 8 p_m_

gushing, but it’s true. Our school
has its share of problems, no institu— SA
tion is perfect, but I would not trade
